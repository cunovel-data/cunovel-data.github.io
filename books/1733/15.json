{"id":69435,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"Jonas Willard looked from side to side and tapped his baton on the stand before him.\\n\\n He said, \"Understood now? This is just a practice scene, designed to find out if we know what we\u0027re doing. We\u0027ve gone through this enough times so that I expect a professional performance now. Get ready. All of you get ready.\"\\n\\n He looked again from side to side. There was a person at each of the voice-recorders, and there were three others working the image projection. A seventh was for the music and an eighth for the all- important background. Others waited to one side for their turn.\\n\\n Willard said, \" All right now. Remember this old man has spent his entire adult life as a tyrant. He is accustomed to having everyone jump at his slightest word, to having everyone tremble at his frown. That is all gone now but he doesn\u0027t know it. He faces his daughter whom he thinks of only as a bent-headed obsequious girl who will do anything he says, and he cannot believe that it is an imperious queen that he now faces. So let\u0027s have the King.\"\\n\\n Lear appeared. Tall, white hair and beard, somewhat disheveled, eyes sharp and piercing.\\n\\n Willard said, \"Not bent. Not bent. He\u0027s eighty years old but he doesn\u0027t think of himself as old. Not now. Straight. Every inch a king.\" The image was adjusted. \"That\u0027s right. And the voice has to be strong.\\n\\n No quavering. Not now. Right?\"\\n\\n \"Right, chief,\" said the Lear voice-recorder, nodding. \"All right. The Queen.\"\\n\\n And there she was, almost as tall as Lear, standing straight and rigid as a statue, her draped clothing in fine array, nothing out of place. Her beauty was as cold and unforgiving as ice.\\n\\n \"And the Fool.\"\\n\\n A little fellow, thin and fragile, like a frightened teenager but with a face too old for a teenager and with a sharp look in eyes that seemed so large that they threatened to devour his face.\\n\\n \"Good,\" said Willard. \"Be ready for Albany. He comes in pretty soon. Begin the scene. \" He tapped the podium again, took a quick glance at the marked-up play before him and said, \"Lear! \" and his baton pointed to the Lear voice-recorder, moving gently to mark the speech cadence that he wanted created.\\n\\n Lear says, \"How now, daughter? What makes that frontlet on? Methinks you are too much o\u0027 late i\u0027 th\u0027 frown.\"\\n\\n The Fool\u0027s thin voice, fifelike, piping, interrupts, \"Thou wast a pretty fellow when thou hadst no need to care for her frowning-\"\\n\\n Goneril, the Queen, turns slowly to face the Clown as he speaks, her eyes turning momentarily into balls of lurid light-doing it so momentarily that those watching caught the impression rather than viewed the fact. The Fool completes his speech in gathering fright and backs his way behind Lear in a blind search for protection against the searing glance.\\n\\n Goneril proceeds to tell Lear the facts of life and there is the faint crackling of thin ice as she speaks, while the music plays in soft discords, barely heard.\\n\\n Nor are Goneril\u0027s demands so out of line, for she wants an orderly court and there couldn\u0027t be one as long as Lear still thought of himself as tyrant. But Lear is in no mood to recognize reason. He breaks into a passion and begins railing.\\n\\n Albany enters. He is Goneril\u0027s consort-round-faced, innocent, eyes looking about in wonder.\\n\\n What is happening? He is completely drowned out by his dominating wife and by his raging father-in-law.\\n\\n It is at this point that Lear breaks into one of the great piercing denunciations in all of literature. He is overreacting. Goneril has not as yet done anything to deserve this, but Lear knows no restraint. He says:\\n\\n \"Hear, Nature, hear! dear goddess, hear!\\n\\n Suspend thy purpose, if thou didst intend\\n\\n To make this creature fruitful.\\n\\n Into her womb convey sterility;\\n\\n Dry up in her the organs of increase;\\n\\n And from her derogate body never spring\\n\\n A babe to honour her! If she must teem,\\n\\n Create her child of spleen, that it may live\\n\\n And be a thwart disnatur\u0027d torment to her.\\n\\n Let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth,\\n\\n With cadent tears fret channels in her cheeks,\\n\\n Turn all her mother\u0027s pains and benefits\\n\\n To laughter and contempt, that she may feel\\n\\n How sharper than a serpent\u0027s tooth, it is\\n\\n To have a thankless child! \"\\n\\n The voice-recorder strengthened Lear\u0027s voice for this speech, gave it a distant hiss, his body became taller and somehow less substantial as though it had been converted into a vengeful Fury.\\n\\n As for Goneril, she remained untouched throughout, never flinching, never receding, but her beautiful face, without any change that could be described, seemed to accumulate evil so that by the end of Lear\u0027s curse, she had the appearance of an archangel still, but an archangel ruined. All possible pity had been wiped out of the countenance, leaving behind only a devil\u0027s dangerous magnificence.\\n\\n The Fool remained behind Lear throughout, shuddering. Albany was the very epitome of confusion, asking useless questions, seeming to want to step between the two antagonists and clearly afraid to do so.\\n\\n Willard tapped his baton and said, \" All right. It\u0027s been recorded and I want you all to watch the scene.\" He lifted his baton high and the synthesizer at the rear of the set began what could only be called the instant replay.\\n\\n It was watched in silence, and Willard said, \"It was good, but I think you\u0027ll grant it was not good enough. I\u0027m going to ask you all to listen to me, so that I can explain what we\u0027re trying to do.\\n\\n Computerized theater is not new, as you all know. Voices and images have been built up to beyond what human beings can do. You don\u0027t have to break your speechifying in order to breathe; the range and quality of the voices are almost limitless; and the images can change to suit the words and action. Still, the technique has only been used, so far, for childish purposes. What we intend now is to make the first serious compu-drama the world has ever seen, and nothing will do-for me, at any rate-but to start at the top. I want to do the greatest play written by the greatest playwright in history: King Lear by William Shakespeare.\\n\\n \"I want not a word changed. I want not a word left out. I don\u0027t want to modernize the play. I don\u0027t want to remove the archaisms, because the play, as written, has its glorious music and any change will diminish it. But in that case, how do we have it reach the general public? I don\u0027t mean the students, I don\u0027t mean the intellectuals, I mean everybody. I mean people who\u0027ve never watched Shakespeare before and whose idea of a good play is a slapstick musical. This play is archaic in spots, and people don\u0027t talk in iambic pentameter. They are not even accustomed to hearing it on the stage.\\n\\n \"So we\u0027re going to have to translate the archaic and the unusual. The voices, more than human, will, just by their timbre and changes, interpret the words. The images will shift to reinforce the words.\\n\\n \"Now Goneril\u0027s change in appearance as Lear\u0027s curse proceeded was good. The viewer will gauge the devastating effect it has on her even though her iron will won\u0027t let it show in words. The viewer will therefore feel the devastating effect upon himself, too, even if some of the words Lear uses are strange to him.\\n\\n \"In that connection, we must remember to make the Fool look older with everyone of his appearances. He\u0027s a weak, sickly fellow to begin with, broken-hearted over the loss of Cordelia, frightened to death of Goneril and Regan, destroyed by the storm from which Lear, his only protector, can\u0027t protect him-and I mean by that the storm of Lear\u0027s daughter\u0027s as well as of the raging weather. When he slips out of the play in Act III. Scene VI, it must be made plain that he is about to die. Shakespeare doesn\u0027t say so, so the Fool\u0027s face must say so.\\n\\n \"However, we\u0027ve got to do something about Lear. The voicerecorder was on the right track by having a hissing sound in the voice-track. Lear is spewing venom; he is a man who, having lost power, has no recourse but vile and extreme words. He is a cobra who cannot strike. But I don\u0027t want the hiss noticeable until the right time. What I am more interested in is the background.\"\\n\\n The woman in charge of background was Meg Cathcart. She had been creating backgrounds for as long as the compu-drama technique had existed.\\n\\n \"What do you want in background? \" Cathcart asked, coolly.\\n\\n \"The snake motif,\" said Willard. \"Give me some of that and there can be less hiss in Lear\u0027s voice.\\n\\n Of course, I don\u0027t want you to show a snake. The too obvious doesn\u0027t work. I want a snake there that people can\u0027t see but that they can feel without quite noting why they feel. I want them to know a snake is there without really knowing it is there, so that it will chill them to the bone, as Lear\u0027s speech should. So when we do it over, Meg, give us a snake that is not a snake.\"\\n\\n \"And how do I do that, Jonas?\" said Cathcart, making free with his first name. She knew her worth and how essential she was.\\n\\n He said, \"I don\u0027t know. If I did I\u0027d be a backgrounder instead of a lousy director. I only know what I want. You\u0027ve got to supply it. You\u0027ve got to supply sinuosity, the impression of scales. Until we get to one point. Notice when Lear says, \u0027How sharper than a serpent\u0027s tooth it is to have a thankless child.\u0027 That is power. The whole speech leads up to that and it is one of the most famous quotes in Shakespeare.\\n\\n And it is sibilant. There is the \u0027sh,\u0027 the three s\u0027s in \u0027serpent\u0027s\u0027 and in \u0027thankless,\u0027 and the two unvoiced \u0027th\u0027s in \u0027tooth\u0027 and \u0027thankless.\u0027 That can be hissed. If you keep down the hiss as much as possible in the rest of the speech, you can hiss here, and you should zero in to his face and make it venomous. And for background, the serpent-which, after all, is now referred to in the words-can make its appearance in background. A flash of an open mouth and fangs, fangs-We must have the momentary appearance of fangs as Lear says, \u0027a serpent\u0027s tooth.\"\u0027\\n\\n Willard felt very tired suddenly. \" All right. We\u0027ll try again tomorrow. I want each one of you to go over the entire scene and try to work out the strategy you intend to use. Only please remember that you are not the only ones involved. What you do must match the others, so I\u0027ll encourage you to talk to each other about this-and, most of all, to listen to me because I have no instrument to handle and I alone can see the playas a whole. And if I seem as tyrannical as Lear at his worst in spots, well, that\u0027s my job.\"\\n\\n Willard was approaching the great storm scene, the most difficult portion of this most difficult play, and he felt wrung out. Lear has been cast out by his daughters into a raging storm of wind and rain, with only his Fool for company, and he has gone almost mad at this mistreatment. To him, even the storm is not as bad as his daughters.\\n\\n Willard pointed his baton and Lear appeared. A point in another direction and the Fool was there clinging, disregarded, to Lear\u0027s left leg. Another point and the background, came in, with its impression of a storm, of a howling wind, of driving rain, of the crackle of thunder and the flash of lightning.\\n\\n The storm took over, a phenomenon of nature, but even as it did so, the image of Lear extended and became what seemed mountain-tall. The storm of his emotions matched the storm of the elements, and his voice gave back to the wind every last howl. His body lost substance and wavered with the wind as though he himself were a storm cloud, contending on an equal basis with the atmospheric fury. Lear, having failed with his daughters, defied the storm to do its worst. He called out in a voice that was far more than human:\\n\\n Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! rage! blow!\\n\\n You cataracts and hurricanoes, spout\\n\\n Till you have drench\u0027d our steeples, drown\u0027d the cocks!\\n\\n You sulph\u0027rous and thought-executing fires.\\n\\n Vaunt-couriers to oak-cleaving thunderbolts,\\n\\n Singe my white head! And thou, all-shaking thunder,\\n\\n Strike flat the thick rotundity o\u0027 th\u0027 world.\\n\\n Crack Nature\u0027s moulds, all germains spill at once.\\n\\n That make ingrateful man.\"\\n\\n The Fool interrupts, his voice shrilling, and making Lear\u0027s defiance the more heroic by contrast.\\n\\n He begs Lear to make his way back to the castle and make peace with his daughters, but Lear doesn\u0027t even hear him. He roars on:\\n\\n Rumble thy bellyful! Spit, fire! spout, rain!\\n\\n Nor rain, wind, thunder, fire are my daughters.\\n\\n I tax not you, you elements, with unkindness.\\n\\n I never gave you kingdom, call\u0027d you children,\\n\\n You owe me no subscription. Then let fall\\n\\n Your horrible pleasure. Here I stand your slave,\\n\\n A poor, infirm, weak, and despis\u0027d old man... ...\"\\n\\n The Duke of Kent, Lear\u0027s loyal servant (though the King in a fit of rage has banished him) finds Lear and tries to lead him to some shelter. After an interlude in the castle of the Duke of Gloucester, the scene returns to Lear in the storm, and he is brought, or rather dragged, to a hovel.\\n\\n And then, finally, Lear learns to think of others. He insists that the Fool enter first and then he lingers outside to think (undoubtedly for the first time in his life) of the plight of those who are not kings and courtiers.\\n\\n His image shrank and the wildness of his face smoothed out. His head was lifted to the rain, and his words seemed detached and to be coming not quite from him, as though he were listening to someone else read the speech. It was, after all, not the old Lear speaking, but a new and better Lear, refined and sharpened by suffering. With an anxious Kent watching, and striving to lead him into the hovel, and with Meg Cathcart managing to work up an impression of beggars merely by producing the fluttering of rags, Lear says:\\n\\n \"Poor naked wretches, wheresoe\u0027er you are...\\n\\n That bide the pelting of this pitiless storm.\\n\\n How shall your houseless heads and unfed sides...\\n\\n Your loop\u0027d and window\u0027d raggedness, defend you\\n\\n From seasons such as these? O, I have ta\u0027en\\n\\n Too little care of this! Take physic, pomp;\\n\\n Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,\\n\\n That thou mayst shake the superflux to them\\n\\n And show the heavens more just.\\n\\n \"Not bad,\" said Wilbur, eventually. \"We\u0027re getting the idea.\\n\\n Only, Meg, rags aren\u0027t enough. Can you manage an impression of hollow eyes? Not blind ones. The eyes are there, but sunken in.\"\\n\\n \"I think I can do that,\" said Cathcart.\\n\\n It was difficult for Willard to believe. The money spent was greater than expected. The time it had taken was considerably greater than had been expected. And the general weariness was far greater than had been expected. Still, the project was coming to an end.\\n\\n He had the reconciliation scene to get through-so simple that it would require the most delicate touches. There would be no background, no souped-up voices, no images, for at this point Shakespeare became simple. Nothing beyond simplicity was needed.\\n\\n Lear was an old man, just an old man. Cordelia, having found him, was a loving daughter, with none of the majesty of Goneril, none of the cruelty of Regan, just softly endearing.\\n\\n Lear, his madness burned out of him, is slowly beginning to understand the situation. He scarcely recognizes Cordelia at first and thinks he is dead and she is a heavenly spirit. Nor does he recognize the faithful Kent.\\n\\n When Cordelia tries to bring him back the rest of the way to sanity, he says:\\n\\n \"Pray, do not mock me.\\n\\n I am a very foolish fond old man.\\n\\n Fo u rsc o re and upward, not an hour more nor less.\\n\\n And, to deal plainly,\\n\\n I fear I am not in my perfect mind.\\n\\n Methinks I should know you, and know this man;\\n\\n Yet I am doubtful; for I am mainly ignorant\\n\\n What place this is; and all the skills I have\\n\\n Remembers not these garments; nor I know not\\n\\n Where I did lodge last night. Do not laugh at me;\\n\\n For (as I am a man) I think this lady\\n\\n To be my child Cordelia.\"\\n\\n Cordelia tells him she is and he says:\\n\\n \"Be your tears wet? Yes, faith. I pray weep not.\\n\\n If you have poison for me, I will drink it.\\n\\n I know you do not love me; for your sisters\\n\\n Have, as I do remember, done me wrong.\\n\\n You have some cause, they have not.\"\\n\\n All poor Cordelia can say is \"No cause, no cause.\"\\n\\n And eventually, Willard was able to draw a deep breath and say, \"We\u0027ve done all we can do. The rest is in the hands of the public.\"\\n\\n It was a year later that Willard, now the most famous man in the entertainment world, met Gregory Laborian. It had come about almost accidentally and largely because of the activities of a mutual friend. Willard was not grateful.\\n\\n He greeted Laborian with what politeness he could manage and cast a cold eye on the time-strip on the wall.\\n\\n He said, \"I don\u0027t want to seem unpleasant or inhospitable, Mr.-uh-but I\u0027m really a very busy man, and don\u0027t have much time.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure of it, but that\u0027s why I want to see you. Surely, you want to do another compu-drama.\"\\n\\n \"Surely I intend to, but,\" and Willard smiled dryly, \" King Lear is a hard act to follow and I don\u0027t intend to turn out something that will seem like trash in comparison.\"\\n\\n \"But what if you never find anything that can match King Lear?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure I never will, but I\u0027ll find something. \" \"I have something. \"\\n\\n \"Oh?\"\\n\\n \"I have a story, a novel, that could be made into a compudrama.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, well. I can\u0027t really deal with items that come in over the transom.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not offering you something from a slush pile. The novel has been published and it has been rather highly thought of.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry. I don\u0027t want to be insulting. But I didn\u0027t recognize your name when you introduced yourself.\"\\n\\n \"Laborian. Gregory Laborian.\"\\n\\n \"But I still don\u0027t recognize it. I\u0027ve never read anything by you. I\u0027ve never heard of you.\"\\n\\n Laborian sighed. \"I wish you were the only one, but you\u0027re not. Still, I could give you a copy of my novel to read.\"\\n\\n Willard shook his head. \"That\u0027s kind of you, Mr. Laborian, but I don\u0027t want to mislead you. I have no time to read it. And even if I had the time-I just want you to understand-I don\u0027t have the inclination.\"\\n\\n \"I could make it worth your while, Mr. Willard. \" \"In what way?\"\\n\\n \"I could pay you. I wouldn\u0027t consider it a bribe, merely an offer of money that you would well deserve if you worked with my novel.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think you understand, Mr. Laborian, how much money it takes to make a first-class compu-drama. I take it you\u0027re not a multimillionaire.\"\\n\\n \"No, I\u0027m not, but I can pay you a hundred thousand globodollars.\"\\n\\n \"If that\u0027s a bribe, at least it\u0027s a totally ineffective one. For a hundred thousand globo-dollars, I couldn\u0027t do a single scene.\"\\n\\n Laborian sighed again. His large brown eyes looked soulful. \"I understand, Mr. Willard, but if you\u0027ll just give me a few more minutes-\" (for Willard\u0027s eyes were wandering to the time-strip again.)\\n\\n \"Well, five more minutes. That\u0027s all I can manage really. \"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s all I need. I\u0027m not offering the money for making the compu-drama. You know, and I know, Mr. Willard, that you can go to any of a dozen people in the country and say you are doing a compu-drama and you\u0027ll get all the money you need. After King Lear, no one will refuse you anything, or even ask you what you plan to do. I\u0027m offering you one hundred thousand globo-dollars for your own use.\"\\n\\n \"Then it is a bribe, and that won\u0027t work with me. Good-bye, Mr. Laborian.\"\\n\\n \"Wait. I\u0027m not offering you an electronic switch. I don\u0027t suggest that I place my financial card into a slot and that you do so, too, and that a hundred thousand globo-dollars be transferred from my account to yours. I\u0027m talking gold, Mr. Willard.\"\\n\\n Willard had risen from his chair, ready to open the door and usher Laborian out, but now he hesitated. \"What do you mean, gold?\"\\n\\n \"I mean that I can lay my hands on a hundred thousand globo-dollars of gold, about fifteen pounds\u0027 worth, I think. I may not be a multimillionaire, but I\u0027m quite well off and I wouldn\u0027t be stealing it.\\n\\n It would be my own money and I am entitled to draw it in gold. There is nothing illegal about it. What I am offering you is a hundred thousand globo-dollars in five-hundred globo-dollar pieces-two hundred of them. Gold, Mr. Willard.\"\\n\\n Gold! Willard was hesitating. Money, when it was a matter of electronic exchange, meant nothing. There was no feeling of either wealth or of poverty above a certain level. The world was a matter of plastic cards (each keyed to a nucleic acid pattern) and of slots, and all the world transferred, transferred, transferred.\\n\\n Gold was different. It had a feel. Each piece had a weight. Piled together it had a gleaming beauty.\\n\\n It was wealth one could appreciate and experience. Willard had never even seen a gold coin, let alone felt or hefted one. Two hundred of them!\\n\\n He didn\u0027t need the money. He was not so sure he didn\u0027t need the gold.\\n\\n He said, with a kind of shamefaced weakness. \"What kind of a novel is it that you are talking about?\"\\n\\n \"Science fiction.\"\\n\\n Willard made a face. \"I\u0027ve never read science fiction. \"\\n\\n \"Then it\u0027s time you expanded your horizons, Mr. Willard. Read mine. If you imagine a gold coin between every two pages of the book, you will have your two hundred.\"\\n\\n And Willard, rather despising his own weakness, said, \"What\u0027s the name of your book?\"\\n\\n \"Three in One. \"\\n\\n \"And you have a copy?\" \"I brought one with me.\"\\n\\n And Willard held out his hand and took it.\\n\\n That Willard was a busy man was by no means a lie. It took him better than a week to find the time to read the book, even with two hundred pieces of gold glittering, and luring him on.\\n\\n Then he sat a while and pondered. Then he phoned Laborian. The next morning, Laborian was in Williard\u0027s office again.\\n\\n Willard said, bluntly, \"Mr. Laborian, I have read your book.\"\\n\\n Laborian nodded and could not hide the anxiety in his eyes. \"I hope you like it, Mr. Willard.\" Willard lifted his hand and rocked it right and left. \"So-so. I told you I have not read science fiction, and I don\u0027t know how good or bad it is of its kind-\" \"Does it matter, if you liked it?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not sure if I liked it. I\u0027m not used to this sort of thing. We are dealing in this novel with three sexes.\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"Which you call a Rational, an Emotional, and a Parental. \"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"But you don\u0027t describe them?\"\\n\\n Laborian looked embarrassed. \"I didn\u0027t describe them, Mr. Willard, because I couldn\u0027t. They\u0027re alien creatures, really alien. I didn\u0027t want to pretend they were alien by simply giving them blue skins or a pair of antennae or a third eye. I wanted them indescribable, so I didn\u0027t describe them, you see.\"\\n\\n \"What you\u0027re saying is that your imagination failed.\"\\n\\n \"N-no. I wouldn\u0027t say that. It\u0027s more like not having that kind of imagination. I don\u0027t describe anyone. If I were to write a story about you and me, I probably wouldn\u0027t bother describing either one of us.\"\\n\\n Willard stared at Laborian without trying to disguise his contempt. He thought of himself. Middle- sized, soft about the middle, needed to reduce a bit, the beginnings of a double chin, and a mole on his right wrist. Light brown hair, dark blue eyes, bulbous nose. What was so hard to describe? Anyone could do it. If you had an imaginary character, think of someone real-and describe.\\n\\n There was Laborian, dark in complexion, crisp curly black hair, looked as though he needed a shave, probably looked that way all the time, prominent Adam\u0027s apple, small scar on the right cheek, dark brown eyes rather large, and his only good feature.\\n\\n Willard said, \"I don\u0027t understand you. What kind of writer are you if you have trouble describing things? What do you write?\"\\n\\n Laborian said, gently, somewhat as though this was not the first time he had had to defend himself along those lines, \"You\u0027ve read T hree in One. I\u0027ve written other novels and they\u0027re all in the same style. Mostly conversation. I don\u0027t see things when I write; I hear, and for most part, what my characters talk about are ideas-competing ideas. I\u0027m strong on that and my readers like it.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, but where does that leave me? I can\u0027t devise a compudrama based on conversation alone. I have to create sight and sound and subliminal messages, and you leave me nothing to work on.\" \"Are you thinking of doing Three in One, then?\"\\n\\n \"Not if you give me nothing to work on. Think, Mr. Laborian, think! This Parental. He\u0027s the dumb one.\"\\n\\n \"Not dumb,\" said Laborian, frowning. \"Single-minded. He only has room in his mind for children, real and potential.\"\\n\\n \"Blockish! If you didn\u0027t use that actual word for the Parental in the novel, and I don\u0027t remember offhand whether you did or not, it\u0027s certainly the impression I got. Cubical. Is that what he is?\"\\n\\n \"Well, simple. Straight lines. Straight planes. Not cubical. Longer than he is wide.\"\\n\\n \"How does he move? Does he have legs?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know. I honestly never gave it any thought.\"\\n\\n \"Hmp. And the Rational. He\u0027s the smart one and he\u0027s smooth and quick. What is he? Egg- shaped?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027d accept that. I\u0027ve never given that any thought, either, but I\u0027d accept that.\"\\n\\n \"And no legs?\"\\n\\n \"I haven\u0027t described any.\"\\n\\n \"And how about the middle one. Your \u0027she\u0027 character-the other two being \u0027he\u0027s.\"\u0027\\n\\n \"The Emotional.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right. The Emotional. You did better on her.\"\\n\\n \"Of course. I did most of my thinking about her. She was trying to save the alien intelligences-us-of an alien world, Earth. The reader\u0027s sympathy must be with her, even though she fails.\"\\n\\n \"I gather she was more like a cloud, didn\u0027t have any firm shape at all, could attenuate and tighten.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, yes. That\u0027s exactly right.\"\\n\\n \"Does she flow along the ground or drift through the air?\"\\n\\n Laborian thought, then shook his head. \"I don\u0027t know. I would say you would have to suit yourself when it came to that. \"\\n\\n \"I see. And what about the sex?\"\\n\\n Laborian said, with sudden enthusiasm. \"That\u0027s a crucial point. I never have any sex in my novels beyond that which is absolutely necessary and then I manage to refrain from describing it-\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t like sex?\"\\n\\n \"I like sex fine, thank you. I just don\u0027t like it in my novels. Everyone else puts it in and, frankly, I think that readers find its absence in my novels refreshing; at least, my readers do. And I must explain to you that my books do very well. I wouldn\u0027t have a hundred thousand dollars to spend if they didn\u0027t.\"\\n\\n \"All right. I\u0027m not trying to put you down.\"\\n\\n \"However, there are always people who say I don\u0027t include sex because I don\u0027t know how, so-out of vainglory, I suppose-I wrote this novel just to show that I c ould do it. The entire novel deals with sex.\\n\\n Of course, it\u0027s alien sex, not at all like ours.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right. That\u0027s why I have to ask you about the mechanics of it. How does it work?\" Laborian looked uncertain for a moment. \"They melt.\"\\n\\n \"I know that that\u0027s the word you use. Do you mean they come together? Superimpose?\"\\n\\n \"I suppose so.\"\\n\\n Willard sighed. \"How can you write a book without knowing anything about so fundamental a part of it?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t have to describe it in detail. The reader gets the impression. With subliminal suggestion so much a part of the compu-drama, how can you ask the question?\"\\n\\n Willard\u0027s lips pressed together. Laborian had him there. \"Very well. They superimpose. What do they look like after they have superimposed? \"\\n\\n Laborian shook his head. \"I avoided that. \"\\n\\n \"You realize, of course, that I can\u0027t.\" Laborian nodded. \"Yes.\"\\n\\n Willard heaved another sigh and said, \"Look, Mr. Laborian, assuming that I agree to do such a compu-drama-and I have not yet made up my mind on the matter-I would have to do it entirely my way. I would tolerate no interference from you. You have ducked so many of your own responsibilities in writing the book that I can\u0027t allow you to decide suddenly that you want to participate in my creative endeavors.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s quite understood, Mr. Willard. I only ask that you keep my story and as much of my dialogue as you can. All of the visual, sonic, and subliminal aspects I am willing to leave entirely in your hands.\"\\n\\n \"You understand that this is not a matter of a verbal agreement which someone in our industry, about a century and a half ago, described as not worth the paper it was written on. There will have to be a written contract made firm by my lawyers that will exclude you from participation.\"\\n\\n \"My lawyers will be glad to look over it, but I assure you I am not going to quibble.\"\\n\\n \"And, \" said Willard severely, \"I will want an advance on the money you offered me. I can\u0027t afford to have you change your mind on me and I am not in the mood for a long lawsuit.\"\\n\\n At this, Laborian frowned. He said, \"Mr. Willard, those who know me never question my financial honesty. You don\u0027t know me so I\u0027ll permit the remark, but please don\u0027t repeat it. How much of an advance do you wish?\"\\n\\n \"Half,\" said Willard, briefly.\\n\\n Laborian said, \"I will do better than that. Once you have obtained the necessary commitments from those who will be willing to put up the money for the compu-drama and once the contract between us is drawn up, then I will give you every cent of the hundred thousand dollars even before you begin the first scene of the book.\"\\n\\n Willard\u0027s eyes opened wide and he could not prevent himself from saying, \"Why?\"\\n\\n \"Because I want to urge you on. What\u0027s more, if the compu-drama turns out to be too hard to do, if it won\u0027t work, or if you turn out something that will not do-my hard luck-you can keep the hundred thousand. It\u0027s a risk I\u0027m ready to take.\"\\n\\n \"Why? What\u0027s the catch?\"\\n\\n \"No catch. I\u0027m gambling on immorality. I\u0027m a popular writer but I have never heard anyone call me a great one. My books are very likely to die with me. Do Three in One as a compu-drama and do it well and that at least might live on, and make my name ring down through the ages,\" he smiled ruefully, \"or at least some ages. However-\"\\n\\n \"Ah,\" said Willard. \"Now we come to it.\"\\n\\n \"Well, yes. I have a dream that I\u0027m willing to risk a great deal for, but I\u0027m not a complete fool. I will give you the hundred thousand I promised before you start and if the thing doesn\u0027t work out you can keep it, but the payment will be electronic. It : however, you turn out a product that satisfies me, then you will return the electronic gift and I will give you the hundred thousand globo-dollars in gold pieces. You have nothing to lose except that to an artist like yourself, gold must be more dramatic and worthwhile than blips in a finance-card. \" And Laborian smiled gently.\\n\\n Willard said, \"Understand, Mr. Laborian! I would be taking a risk, too. I risk losing a great deal of time and effort that I might have devoted to a more likely project. I risk producing a docudrama that will be a failure and that will tarnish the reputation I have built up with Lear. In my business, you\u0027re only as good as your most recent product. I will consult various people-\" \"On a confidential basis, please.\"\\n\\n \"Of course! And I will do a bit of deep consideration. I am willing to go along with your proposition for now, but you mustn\u0027t think of it as a definite commitment. Not yet. We will talk further.\"\\n\\n Jonas Willard and Meg Cathcart sat together over lunch in Meg\u0027s apartment. They were at their coffee when Willard said, with apparent reluctance as one who broaches a subject he would rather not, \"Have you read the book? \"\\n\\n \"Yes, I have.\"\\n\\n \"And what did you think?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" said Cathcart peering at him from under the dark, reddish hair she wore clustered over her forehead. \" At least not enough to judge.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re not a science fiction buff either, then?\"\\n\\n \"Well, I\u0027ve read science fiction, mostly sword and sorcery, but nothing like Three in One. I\u0027ve heard of Laborian, though. He does what they call \u0027hard science fiction.\"\u0027\\n\\n \"It\u0027s hard enough. I don\u0027t see how I can do it. That book, whatever its virtues, just isn\u0027t me.\"\\n\\n Cathcart fixed him with a sharp glance. \"How do you know it isn\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n \"Listen, it\u0027s important to know what you can\u0027t do.\"\\n\\n \"And you were born knowing you can\u0027t do science fiction?\"\\n\\n \"I have an instinct in these things.\"\\n\\n \"So you say. Why don\u0027t you think what you might do with those three undescribed characters, and what you would want subliminally, before you let your instinct tell you what you can and can\u0027t do. For instance, how would you do the Parental, who is referred to constantly as \u0027he\u0027 even though it\u0027s the Parental who bears the children? That struck me as jackassy, if you must know.\"\\n\\n \"No, no,\" said Willard, at once. \"I accept the \u0027he.\u0027 Laborian might have invented a third pronoun, but it would have made no sense and the reader would have gagged on it. Instead, he reserved the pronoun, \u0027she,\u0027 for the Emotional. She\u0027s the central character, differing from the other two enormously. The use of \u0027she\u0027 for her and only for her focuses the reader\u0027s attention on her, and it\u0027s on her that the reader\u0027s attention must focus. What\u0027s more, it\u0027s on her that the viewer\u0027s attention must focus in the compu-drama.\"\\n\\n \"Then you have been thinking of it. \" She grinned, impishly. \"I wouldn\u0027t have known if I hadn\u0027t needled you.\"\\n\\n Willard stirred uneasily. \" Actually, Laborian said something of the sort, so I can\u0027t lay claim to complete creativity here. But let\u0027s get back to the Parental. I want to talk about these things to you because everything is going to depend on subliminal suggestion, if I do try to do this thing. The Parental is a block, a rectangle.\"\\n\\n \"A right parallelepiped, I think they would call it in solid geometry.\"\\n\\n \"Come on. I don\u0027t care what they call it in solid geometry. The point is we can\u0027t just have a block. We have to give it personality. The Parental is a \u0027he\u0027 who bears children, so we have to get across an epicene quality. The voice has to be neither clearly masculine nor feminine. I\u0027m not sure that I have in mind exactly the timbre and sound I will need, but that will be for the voice-recorder and myself to work out by trial and error, I think. Of course, the voice isn\u0027t the only thing.\"\\n\\n \"What else?\"\\n\\n \"The feet. The Parental moves about, but there is no description of any limbs. He has to have the equivalent of arms; there are things he does. He obtains an energy source that he feeds the Emotional, so we\u0027ll have to evolve arms that are alien but that are arms. And we need legs. And a number of sturdy, stumpy legs that move rapidly.\"\\n\\n \"Like a caterpillar? Or a centipede?\"\\n\\n Willard winced. \"Those aren\u0027t pleasant comparisons, are they?\"\\n\\n \"Well, it would be my job to subliminate, if I may use the expression, a centipede, so to speak, without showing one. Just the notion of a series of legs, a double fading row of parentheses, just on and off as a kind of visual leitmotiv for the Parental, whenever he appears.\"\\n\\n \"I see what you mean. We\u0027ll have to try it out and see what we can get away with. The Rational is ovoid. Laborian admitted it might be egg-shaped. We can imagine him progressing by rolling but I find that completely inappropriate. The Rational is mind-proud, dignified. We can\u0027t make him do anything laughable, and rolling would be laughable.\"\\n\\n \"We could have him with a flat bottom slightly curved, and he could slide along it, like a penguin belly-whopping.\"\\n\\n \"Or like a snail on a layer of grease. No. That would be just as bad. I had thought of having three legs extrude. In other words, when he is at rest, he would be smoothly ovoid and proud of it, but when he is moving three stubby legs emerge and he can walk on them.\"\\n\\n \"Why three?\"\\n\\n \"It carries on the three motif; three sexes, you know. It could be a kind of hopping run. The foreleg digs in and holds firm and the two hind legs come along on each side.\"\\n\\n \"Like a three-legged kangaroo?\"\\n\\n \"Yes! Can you subliminate a kangaroo?\" \"I can try.\"\\n\\n \"The Emotional, of course, is the hardest of the three. What can you do with something that may be nothing but a coherent cloud of gas?\"\\n\\n Cathcart considered. \"What about giving the impression of draperies containing nothing. They would be moving about wraithlike, just as you presented Lear in the storm scene. She would be wind, she would be air, she would be the filmy, foggy draperies that would represent that.\"\\n\\n Willard felt himself drawn to the suggestion. \"Hey, that\u0027s not bad, Meg. For the subliminal effect, could you do Helen of Troy?\" \"Helen of Troy?\"\\n\\n \"Yes! To the Rational and Parental, the Emotional is the most beautiful thing ever invented. They\u0027re crazy about her. There\u0027s this strong, almost unbearable sexual attraction-their kind of sex-and we\u0027ve got to make the audience aware of it in their terms. If you can somehow get across a statuesque Greek woman, with bound hair and draperies-the draperies would exactly fit what we\u0027re imagining for the Emotional-and make it look like the paintings and sculptures everyone is familiar with, that would be the Emotional\u0027s leitmotiv.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t ask simple things. The slightest intrusion of a human figure will destroy the mood.\" \"You don\u0027t intrude a human figure. Just the suggestion of one. It\u0027s important. A human figure, in actual fact, may destroy the mood, but we\u0027ll have to suggest human figures throughout. The audience has to think of these odd things as human beings. No mistake.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll think about it,\" said Cathcart, dubiously.\\n\\n \"Which brings us to another thing. The melting. The triple-sex of these things. I gather they superimpose. I gather from the book that the Emotional is the key to that. The Parental and Rational can\u0027t melt without her. She\u0027s the essential part of the process. But, of course, that fool, Laborian, doesn\u0027t describe it in detail. Well, we can\u0027t have the Rational and Parental running toward the Emotional and jumping on her. That would kill the drama at once no matter what else we might do.\"\\n\\n \"I agree.\"\\n\\n \"What we must do, then, and this is off the top of my head, is to have the Emotional expand, the draperies move out and enswathe (if that\u0027s the word) both Parental and Rational. They are obscured by the draperies and we don\u0027t see exactly how it\u0027s done but they get closer and closer until they superimpose.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll have to emphasize the drapery,\" said Cathcart. \"We\u0027ll have to make it as graceful as possible in order to get across the beauty of it, and not just the eroticism. We\u0027ll have to have music.\"\\n\\n \"Not the Romeo and Juliet overture, please. A slow waltz, perhaps, because the melting takes a long time. And not a familiar one. I don\u0027t want the audience humming along with it. In fact, it would be best if it comes in occasional bits so that the audience gets the impression of a waltz, rather than actually hearing it.\"\\n\\n \"We can\u0027t see how to do it, until we try it and see what works.\"\\n\\n \"Everything I say now is a first-order suggestion that may have to be yanked about this way and that under the pressure of actual events. And what about the orgasm? We\u0027ll have to indicate that somehow.\"\\n\\n \"Color.\"\\n\\n \"Hmm.\"\\n\\n \"Better than sound, Jonas. You can\u0027t have an explosion. I wouldn\u0027t want some kind of eruption, either. Color. Silent color. That might do it.\"\\n\\n \"What color? I don\u0027t want a blinding flash, either. \"\\n\\n \"No. You might try a delicate pink, very slowly darkening, and then toward the end suddenly becoming a deep, deep red.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not sure. We\u0027ll have to try it out. It must be unmistakable and moving and not make the audience giggle or feel embarrassed. I can see ourselves running through every color change in the spectrum, and, in the end, finding that it will depend on what you do subliminally. And that brings us to the triple-beings.\"\\n\\n \"The what?\"\\n\\n \"You know. After the last melting, the superimposition remains permanent and we have the adult form that is all three components together. There, I think, we\u0027ll have to make them more human. Not human, mind you. Just more human. A faint suggestion of human form, not just subliminal, either. We\u0027ll need a voice that is somehow reminiscent of all three, and I don\u0027t know how the recorder can make that work. Fortunately, the triple-beings don\u0027t appear much in the story.\"\\n\\n Willard shook his head. \" And that brings us to the rough fact that the compu-drama might not be a possible project at all.\"\\n\\n \"Why not? You seem to have been offering potential solutions of all kinds for the various problems.\"\\n\\n \"Not for the essential part. look! In King Lear, we had human characters, more than human characters. You had searing emotions. What have we got here? We have funny little cubes and ovals and drapery. Tell me how my Three in One is going to be different from an animated cartoon?\"\\n\\n \"For one thing, an animated cartoon is two-dimensional. Even with elaborate animation it is flat, and its coloring is without shading. It is invariably satiricial-\"\\n\\n \"I know all that. That\u0027s not what I want you to tell me. You\u0027re missing the important point. What a compu-drama has, that a mere animated cartoon does not, are subliminal suggestions such as can only be created by a: complex computer in the hands of an imaginative genius. What my compu-drama has that an animated cartoon doesn\u0027t is you, Meg.\"\\n\\n \"Well, I was being modest. \"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t be. I\u0027m trying to tell you that everything -everything- is going to depend on you. We have a story here that is dead serious. Our Emotional is trying to save Earth out of pure idealism; it\u0027s not her world. And she doesn\u0027t succeed, and she won\u0027t succeed in my version, either. No cheap, happy ending.\"\\n\\n \"Earth isn\u0027t exactly destroyed.\"\\n\\n \"No, it isn\u0027t. There\u0027s still time to save it if Laborian ever gets around to doing a sequel, but in this story the attempt fails. It\u0027s a tragedy and I want it treated as one-as tragic as Lear. No funny voices, no humorous actions, no satirical touches. Serious. Serious. Serious. And I\u0027m going to depend on you to make it so. It will be you who makes sure that the audience reacts to the Rational, the Emotional, the Parental, as though they were human beings. All their peculiarities will have to melt away and they\u0027ll have to be recognized as intelligent beings on a par with humanity, if not ahead of it. Can you do it?\"\\n\\n Cathcart said dryly, \"It looks as though you will insist I can.\" \"I do so insist.\"\\n\\n \"Then you had better see about getting the ball rolling, and you leave me alone while you\u0027re doing it. I need time to think. Lots of time.\"\\n\\n The early days of the shooting were an unmitigated disaster. Each member of the crew had his copy of the book, carefully, almost surgically trimmed, but with no scenes entirely omitted.\\n\\n \"We\u0027re going to stick to the course of the book as closely as we can, and improve it as we go along just as much as we can,\" Willard had announced confidently. \" And the first thing we do is get a hold on the triple-beings.\"\\n\\n He turned to the head voice-recorder. \"How have you been working on that?\" \"I\u0027ve tried to fuse the three voices. \"\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s hear. All right, everyone quiet.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll give you the Parental first,\" said the recorder. There came a thin, tenor voice, out of key with the blockish figure that the Image man had produced. Willard winced slightly at the mismatch, but the Parental was mismatched-a masculine mother. The Rational, rocking slowly back and forth, had a somewhat self-important voice; enunciation over-careful, and it was a light baritone.\\n\\n Willard interrupted. \"Less rocking in the Rational. We don\u0027t want the audience to become seasick. He rocks when he is deep in thought, and not all the time.\"\\n\\n He then nodded his head at Dua\u0027s draperies, which seemed quite successful, as did her clear and infinitely sweet soprano voice.\\n\\n \"She must never shriek,\" said Willard, severely, \"not even when she is in a passion.\"\\n\\n \"She won\u0027t,\" said the recorder. \"The trick is, though, to blend the voices in setting up the triple- being, in having each one distantly identifiable.\"\\n\\n All three voices sounded softly, the words not clear. They seemed to melt into each other and then the voice could be heard enunciating.\\n\\n Willard shook his head in immediate discontent. \"No, that won\u0027t do at all. We can\u0027t have three voices in a kind of intimate patchwork. We\u0027d be making the triple-being a figure of fun. We need one voice which somehow suggests all three.\"\\n\\n The voice-recorder was clearly offended. \"It\u0027s easy to say that. How do you suggest we do it?\"\\n\\n \"I do it,\" said Willard, brutally, \"by ordering you to do it. I\u0027ll tell you when you have it. And Cathcart-where is Cathcart?\"\\n\\n \"Here I am,\" she said, emerging from behind her instrumentation. \"Where I\u0027m supposed to be.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t like the sublimination, Cathcart. I gather you tried to give the impression of cerebral convolutions.\"\\n\\n \"For intelligence. The triple-beings represent the intelligence-peak of these aliens.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, I understand, but what you managed to do was to give the impression of worms. You\u0027ll have to think of something else. And I don\u0027t like the appearance of the triple-being, either. He looks just like a big Rational.\"\\n\\n \"He is like a big Rational,\" said one of the imagists.\\n\\n \"Is he described in the book that way?\" asked Willard, sharply. \"Not in so many words, but the impression I get-\"\\n\\n \"Never mind your impression. I\u0027ll make the decisions.\"\\n\\n Willard grew fouler-tempered as the day wore on. At least twice he had difficulty controlling his passion, the second time coming when he happened to notice someone watching the proceedings from a spot at one edge of the lot.\\n\\n He strode toward him angrily. \"What are you doing here?\"\\n\\n It was Laborian, who answered quietly, \"Watching. \"\\n\\n \"Our contract states-\"\\n\\n \"That I am to interfere in the proceedings in no way. It does not say I cannot watch quietly.\" \"You\u0027ll get upset if you do. This is the way preparing a compudrama works. There are lots of glitches to overcome and it would be upsetting to the company to have the author watching and disapproving.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not disapproving. I\u0027m here only to answer questions if you care to ask them.\" \"Questions? What kind of questions?\"\\n\\n Laborian shrugged. \"I don\u0027t know. Something might puzzle you and you might want a suggestion.\"\\n\\n \"I see,\" said Willard, with heavy irony, \"so you can teach me my business.\"\\n\\n \"No, so I can answer your questions.\"\\n\\n \"Well, I have one.\"\\n\\n \"Very well,\" and Laborian produced a small cassette recorder. \"If you\u0027ll just speak into this and say that you are asking me a question and wish me to answer without prejudicing the contract, we\u0027re in business.\"\\n\\n Willard paused for a considerable time, staring at Laborian as though he suspected trickery of some sort, then he spoke into the cassette.\\n\\n \"Very well,\" said Laborian. \"What\u0027s your question?\"\\n\\n \"Did you have anything in mind for the appearance of the triple-being in the book?\" \"Not a thing,\" said Laborian, cheerfully.\\n\\n \"How could you do that?\" Willard\u0027s voice trembled as though he were holding back a final \"you idiot\" by main force.\\n\\n \"Easily. What I don\u0027t describe, the reader supplies in his own mind. Each reader does it differently to suit himself, I presume. That\u0027s the advantage of writing. A compu-drama would have an enormously larger audience than a book could have, but you must pay for that by having to present an image.\"\\n\\n \"I understand that,\" said Willard. \"So much for the question, then.\" \"Not at all. I have a suggestion.\"\\n\\n \"Like what?\"\\n\\n \"Like a head. Give the triple-being a head. The Parental has no head, nor the Rational, nor the Emotional, but all three look up to the triple-beings as creatures of intelligence beyond their own. That is the entire difference between the triple-beings and the three Separates. Intelligence.\"\\n\\n \"A head?\"\\n\\n \"Yes. We associate intelligence with heads. The head contains the brain, it contains the sense organs. Omit the head and we cannot believe in intelligence. The headless oysters or clams are mollusks that seem no more intelligent to us than a spring of grass would be, but the related octopus, also a mollusk, we accept as possibly intelligent because it has a head-and eyes. Give the triple-being eyes, too.\"\\n\\n Work had, of course, ceased on the set. Everyone had gathered in as closely as they thought judicious to listen to the conversation between director and author.\\n\\n Willard said, \"What kind of head?\"\\n\\n \" Your choice. All you need is a bulge suggesting a head. And eyes. The viewer is sure to get the idea.\"\\n\\n W illard turned away, shouting, \"Well, get back to work. Who called a vacation? Where are the imagists? Back to the machine and begin trying out heads.\"\\n\\n He turned suddenly and said, in an almost surly fashion, to Laborian. \"Thank you! \" \"Only if it works,\" said Laborian, shrugging.\\n\\n The rest of the day was spent in testing heads, searching for one that was not a humorous bulge, and not an unimaginative copy of the human head, and eyes that were not astonished circles or vicious slits.\\n\\n Then, finally, Willard called a halt and growled, \"We\u0027ll try again tomorrow. If anyone gets any brilliant thoughts overnight, give them to Meg Cathcart. She\u0027ll pass on to me any that are worth it.\" And he added, in an annoyed mutter, \"I suppose she\u0027ll have to remain silent.\"\\n\\n Willard was right and wrong. He was right. There were no brilliant ideas handed to him, but he was wrong for he had one of his own.\\n\\n He said to Cathcart, \"Listen, can you get across a top hat?\"\\n\\n \"A what?\"\\n\\n \"The sort of thing they wore in Victorian times. Look, when the Parental invades the lair of the triple-beings to steal an energy source, he\u0027s not an impressive sight in himself, but you told me you could just get across the idea of a helmet and a long line that will give the notion of a spear. He\u0027ll be on a knightly quest.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, I know,\" she said, \"but it might not work. We\u0027ll have to try it out.\"\\n\\n \"Of course, but that points the direction. If you have just a suggestion of a top hat, it will give the impression of the triple-being as an aristocrat. The exact shape of the head and eyes becomes less crucial in that case. Can it be done?\"\\n\\n \"Anything can be done. The question is: will it work? \"\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll try it.\"\\n\\n And as it happened, one thing led to another. The suggestion of the top hat caused the voice- recorder to say, \"Why not give the triple-being a British accent? \"\\n\\n Willard was caught off-guard. \"Why?\"\\n\\n \"Well, the British have a language with more tones than we do. At least, the upper classes do. The American version of English tends to be flat, and that\u0027s true of the Separates, too. If the triple-being spoke British rather than English, his voice could rise and fall with the words-tenor and baritone and even an occasional soprano squeak. That\u0027s what we would want to indicate with the three voices out of which his voice was formed.\"\\n\\n \"Can you do that?\" said Willard. \"I think so.\"\\n\\n \"Then we\u0027ll try. Not bad-if it works.\"\\n\\n It was interesting to see how the entire group found themselves engaged in the Emotional.\\n\\n The scene in particular where the Emotional was fleeing across the face of the planet, where she had her brief set-to with the other Emotionals caught at everyone.\\n\\n Willard said tensely, \"This is going to be one of the great dramatic scenes. We\u0027ll put it out as widely as we can. It\u0027s going to be draperies, draperies, draperies, but they must not be entangled one with the other. Each one must be distinct. Even when you rush the Emotionals in toward the audience I want each set of draperies to be a different off-white. And I want Dua\u0027s drapery to be distinct from all of them. I want her to glitter a little, just to be different, and because she\u0027s our Emotional. Got it?\"\\n\\n \"Got it,\" said the leading imagist. \"We\u0027ll handle it.\"\\n\\n \"And another thing. All the other Emotionals twitter. They\u0027re birds. Our Emotional doesn\u0027t twitter, and she despises the rest because she\u0027s more intelligent than they are and she knows it. And when she\u0027s fleeing-\" he paused, and brooded a bit. \"Is there any way we can get away from the \u0027Ride of the Valkyries\u0027?\"\\n\\n \" W e don\u0027t want to,\" said the soundman promptly. \"Nothing better for the purpose has ever been written.\"\\n\\n Cathcart said, \"Yes, but we\u0027ll only have snatches of it now and then. Hearing a few bars has the effect of the whole, and I can insert the hint of tossing manes.\" \"Manes?\" said Willard, dubiously.\"\\n\\n Absolutely. Three thousand years of experience with horses has pinned us down to the galloping stallion as the epitome of wild speed. All our mechanical devices are too static, however fast they go. And I can arrange to have the manes just match, emphasize, and punctuate the flowing of the draperies.\"\\n\\n \"That sounds good. We\u0027ll try it.\"\\n\\n Willard knew where the final stumbling block would be found. The last melting. He called the troupe together to lecture them, partly to make sure they understood what it was they were all doing now, partly to put off the time of reckoning when they would actually try to put it all into sound, image, and sublimination.\\n\\n He said, \" All right, the Emotional\u0027s interest is in saving the other world-Earth-only because she can\u0027t bear the thought of the meaningless destruction of intelligent beings. She knows the triple-beings are carrying through a scientific project, necessary for the welfare of her world and caring nothing for the danger into which it puts the alien world-us.\\n\\n \"She tries to warn the alien world and fails. She knows, at last, that the whole purpose of melting is to produce a new set of Rational, Emotional and Parental, and then, with that done, there is a final melting that would turn the original set into a triple-being. Do you have that? It\u0027s a sort of larval form of Separates and an adult form of triples.\\n\\n \"But the Emotional doesn\u0027t want to melt. She doesn\u0027t want to produce the new generation. Most of all, she doesn\u0027t want to become a triple-being and participate in what she considers their work of destruction. She is, however, tricked into the final melt and realizes too late that she is not only going to be a triple-being but a triple-being who will be, more than any other, responsible for the scientific project that will destroy the other world.\\n\\n \"All this Laborian could describe in words, words, words, in his book, but we\u0027ve got to do it more immediately and more forcefully, in images and sublimination as well. That\u0027s what we\u0027re now going to try to do.\"\\n\\n They were three days in the trying before Willard was satisfied.\\n\\n The weary Emotional, uncertain, stretching outward, with Cathcart\u0027s sublimination instilling the feeling of not-sure, not-sure. The Rational and Parental enfolded and coming together, more rapidly than on previous occasions-hurrying for the superimposition before it might be stopped-and the Emotional realizing too late the significance of it all and struggling-struggling-\\n\\n And failure. The drenching feeling of failure as a new triple-being stepped out of the superimposition, more nearly human than anyone else in the compu-drama-proud, indifferent.\\n\\n The scientific procedure would go on. Earth would continue the downward slide.\\n\\n And somehow this was it-this was the nub of everything that Willard was trying to do-that within the new triple-being the Emotional still existed in part. There was just the wisping of drapery and the viewer was to know that the defeat was not final after all.\\n\\n The Emotional would, somehow, still try, lost though it was in a greater being.\\n\\n They watched the completed compu-drama, all of them, seeing it for the first time as a whole and not as a collection of parts, wondering if there were places to edit, to reorder. (Not now, thought Willard, not now. Afterwards, when he had recovered and could look at it more objectively.)\\n\\n He sat in his chair, slumped. He had put too much of himself into it. It had seemed to him that it contained everything he wanted it to contain; that it did everything he wanted to have done; but how much of that was merely wishful thinking?\\n\\n When it was over and the last tremulous, subliminal cry of the defeated-but-not-yet-defeated Emotional faded, he said, \"Well.\"\\n\\n And Cathcart said, \"That\u0027s almost as good as your King Lear was, Jonas.\"\\n\\n There was a general murmur of agreement and Willard cast a cynical eye about him. Wasn\u0027t that what they would be bound to say, no matter what?\\n\\n His eye caught that of Gregory Laborian. The writer was expressionless, said nothing.\\n\\n Willard\u0027s mouth tightened. There at least he could expect an opinion that would be backed, or not backed, by gold. Willard had his hundred thousand. He would see now whether it would stay electronic.\\n\\n He said, and his own uncertainty made him sound imperious, \"Laborian. I want to see you in my office.\"\\n\\n They were together alone for the first time since well before the compu-drama had been made. \"Well?\" said Willard. \"What do you think, Mr. Laborian?\"\\n\\n Laborian smiled. \"That woman who runs the subliminal background told you that it was almost as good as your King Lear was, Mr. Willard.\"\\n\\n \"I heard her.\"\\n\\n \"She was quite wrong. \" \"In your opinion?\"\\n\\n \"Yes. My opinion is what counts right now. She was quite wrong. Your Three in One is much better than your King Lear.\"\\n\\n \"Better?\" Willard\u0027s weary face broke into a smile.\\n\\n \"Much better. Consider the material you had to work with in doing King Lear. You had William Shakespeare, producing words that sang, that were music in themselves; William Shakespeare producing characters who, whether for good or evil, whether strong or weak, whether shrewd or foolish, whether faithful or traitorous, were all larger than life; William Shakespeare, dealing with two overlapping plots, reinforcing each other and tearing the viewers to shreds.\\n\\n \"What was your contribution to King Lear? You added dimensions that Shakespeare lacked the technological knowledge to deal with; that he couldn\u0027t dream of; but the fanciest technologies and all that your people and your own talents could do could only build somewhat on the greatest literary genius of all time, working at the peak of his power.\\n\\n \"But in Three in One, Mr. Willard, you were working with my words which didn\u0027t sing; my characters, which weren\u0027t great; my plot which tore at no one. You dealt with me, a run-of-the-mill writer and you produced something great, something that will be remembered long after I am dead. One book of mine, anyway, will live on because of what you have done.\\n\\n \"Give me back my electronic hundred thousand, Mr. Willard, and I will give you this.\"\\n\\n The hundred thousand was shifted back from one financial card to the other and, with an effort, Laborian then pulled his fat briefcase onto the table and opened it. From it, he drew out a box, fastened with a small hook. He unfastened it carefully, and lifted the top. Inside it glittered the gold pieces, each one marked with the planet Earth, the western hemisphere on one side, the eastern on the other. Large gold pieces, two hundred of them, each worth five hundred globo-dollars.\\n\\n Willard, awed, plucked out one of the gold pieces. It weighed about one and a quarter ounces. He threw it up in the air and caught it.\\n\\n \"Beautiful,\" he said.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s yours, Mr. Willard,\" said Laborian. \"Thank you for doing the compu-drama for me. It is worth every piece of that gold.\"\\n\\n Willard stared at the gold and said, \"You made me do the compu-drama of your book with your offer of this gold. To get this gold, I forced myself beyond my talents. Thank you for that, and you are right. It was worth every piece of that gold.\"\\n\\n He put the gold piece back in the box and closed it. Then he lifted the box and handed it back to Laborian. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/gold-the-final-science-fiction-collection/page-15.html","bookId":1733,"book":{"id":1733,"title":"Gold: The Final Science Fiction Collection","description":"Storyline: Gold: The Final Science Fiction Collection \\n by Isaac Asimov, Orson Scott Card (Introduction) \\n Gold is the final and crowning achievement of the fifty-year career of science fiction\u0027s transcendent genius, the world-famous author who defined the field of science fiction for its practitioners, its millions of readers, and the world at large. \\n The first section contains stories that range from the humorous to the profound, at the heart of which is the title story, \"Gold,\" a moving and revealing drama about a writer who gambles everything on a chance at immortality: a gamble Asimov himself made -- and won.
