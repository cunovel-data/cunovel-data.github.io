{"id":22253,"no":7,"title":"CHAPTER VI THE EUMERALLA WAR","content":"We had been informed that the Eumeralla people, when that station was first taken up by Mr. Hunter for Hughes and Hoskins, of Sydney, always took their guns into the milking-yard with them, for fear of a surprise. The story went that one day a sudden attack \"was\" made. While the main body was engaged, a wing of the invading force made a flank movement, and bore down upon the apparently undefended homestead. There, however, they were confronted by Mr. William Carmichael, a neighbour of Falstaffian proportions, who stood in the doorway brandishing a rusty cutlass which he had discovered. Whether the blacks were demoralised by the appearance of the fattest man they had ever seen, or awestricken at the fierceness of his bearing, is not known, but they wheeled and fled just as their main army had concluded to fall back on Mount Eeles. Of Messrs. Gorrie and M\u0027Gregor (uncle and nephew), who were chief among the Eumeralla pioneers, having come down with the original herd of ITH cattle, with which the run was first occupied,[Pg 52] many tales are told. The former, a stalwart, iron-nerved, elderly Scot, was the envied possessor of a rifle of great length of barrel and the deadliest performance. The coolness of its owner under fire (of spears) was a matter of legendary lore. In a raid upon the heathen, shortly after an unprovoked murder on their part, two aboriginals bolted out of their cover immediately in front of Mr. Gorrie. Running their best, and leaping from side to side as they went, the nearer one made frantic signs to the effect that the other man was the real culprit. \"Bide a wee,\" quoth the calm veteran, as the barrel of the old rifle settled to its aim. \"Bide a wee, laddie, and I\u0027ll sort ye baith.\" Which the legend goes on to say he actually did, disposing of the appellant at sight, and knocking over the other before he got out of range of la longue carabine. One day Mr. M\u0027Gregor was returning through disturbed country. While discovering \"Injun sign\" to be tolerably plain and recent, his horse at speed fell under him, and rolled over, a tremendous cropper. He picked himself up, and, going over to the motionless steed, found that he was stone dead—he had broken both forelegs and his neck. A moment\u0027s thought, and he picked up the saddle and bridle, and, thus loaded, ran the seven or eight miles home at a pace which Deerfoot would have respected. Things went on prosperously for some months. \"The hut,\" a substantial and commodious structure, arose in all its grandeur. It boasted loopholes on either side of the huge, solid chimney, built out of the cube-shaped basaltic blocks which lay around in[Pg 53] profusion. So we were prepared for a siege. A stock-yard was the next necessity; to split and put up this important adjunct, without which we had no real title to call ourselves a cattle station, was imperative. \"Four rails and a cap,\" as the description ran, of the heavy substantial fence then thought necessary for the business, were to be procured. The white-gum timber, though good enough in a splitting sense for slabs, was not the thing for stock-yard work. So, as we knew by report from the \"Eumeralla people\" that there was a tract of stringy-bark forest about eight miles south of us towards the coast, we determined to get our timber there. The bushman who had put up the Eumeralla huts—one Tinker Woods, an expatriated gipsy, it was said, whom therefore I regarded with great interest—had marked some trees which would serve to guide us. Joe Burge thought he could manage the rest. The \"round stuff\" we could cut close about. But the heavy rails, nine feet in length, from three to five inches thick, and as straight as a board paling, we had to get from the forest. As Mr. Cunningham had gone, and the old stockman, Tom, had quite enough to do minding the cattle, the work fell on Joe Burge and myself. This is how it was managed. At daylight we started one Monday morning, taking the dray and team, with maul and wedges, crosscut saw and axes, bedding, blankets, and a week\u0027s rations, not forgetting the guns. When we got to the forest, after finding the Tinker\u0027s Tree (it bore the name years after)—an immense stringy bark, with a section of the outside wood split down to see if the grain was free—we[Pg 54] soon pitched upon a \"good straight barrel,\" and set to work. Joe cut a good-sized \"calf\" in it first, and then we introduced the crosscut. I had got through a reasonable amount of manual exercise, and had more than one spell, when the tall tree began to sway, and, as we drew back to the right side of the stump, came crashing down, flattening all the lighter timber in its way. \"Now, sir,\" quoth Joe, \"you give me a hand to crosscut the first length. There\u0027ll be two more after that. Them I\u0027ll do myself, and now we\u0027ll have a pot of tea. You can take the team home, and come back the day after to-morrow. I\u0027ll have a load of rails ready for you.\" We had our meal in great comfort and contentment. Then I started off to drive the team back. At sunset I saw the thatched roof of our hut. I had walked sixteen miles there and back, besides helping to fell our tree, and unyoking the team afterwards. I slept soundly that night. I drove the team back to the forest on the day named, and found Joe perfectly well and contented, having split up the whole of the tree into fine, straight, substantial rails, thirty of which were put upon the dray. After helping to cut down another tree, I departed on my homeward journey. On Saturday the same proceedings took place, and da capo until all the rails were split and drawn in. Joe must have felt pretty lonely at night, camped in a bark gunyah, with the black pillars of the stringy-bark trees around him, and not a soul within reach or ken. But he was not of a nervous temperament—by wood or wold, land or sea, on foot[Pg 55] or horseback, hand-to-hand fight, sword or pistol, it was all one to Joe. He was afraid of nothing and nobody. And when, years after, his son returned from India with the Queen\u0027s Commission and the Victoria Cross, I knew where the bold blood had come from. Towards the end of our wood-ranging, a rumour got abroad that the blacks had \"broken out\" and commenced to spear cattle. They had, moreover, \"intromitted with the Queen\u0027s lieges,\" as Dugald Dalgetty would have said. Mr. Cunningham, riding through the greenwood at Dunmore, had had three spears thrown at him by blacks, one of which went through his hat. They then (he averred) disappeared into an \"impenetrable scrub.\" Neighbours talked of arming and going out in force to expostulate, if this kind of thing was to go on. I told Joe of this, and brought a message from Mrs. Burge to say that Old Tom, who knew the blacks well, was getting anxious, that he must not stay away any longer, but had better come home with me. Joe agreed generally, but said there was one lovely, straight tree that he must run out, and if I would help him fell this, he would come directly it was finished. I tried to persuade him, but it was useless. So we \"threw\" the tree, and loaded up. I started home again alone. Now the tree was a large tree; the load heavier than usual. My departure was late in consequence, and the moon rose before I had half finished my homeward journey. To add to my trouble I got into a soft spot in the marsh road, and in the altercation one of my leaders, a hot-tempered animal, slued[Pg 56] round and \"turned his yoke.\" Gentlemen who have driven teams will understand the situation. The bows were by this man?uvre placed on the tops of the bullocks\u0027 necks, the yoke underneath, and the off-side bullock became the near-side one. I was nearly in despair. I dared not unyoke them, because they, being fresh, would have bolted and left me helpless. So I compromised, and started the team, finding that by keeping pretty wide of my leaders and behaving with patience they would keep the track. The road was moderately open, and they knew they were going home. At one part of the road I had to pass between two walls of ti-tree, a tall kind of scrub through which I could not see, and which looked in the moonlight very dark and eerie. I began to think about the blacks, and whether or no they might attack us in force. At that very moment I heard a wild shrill cry, which considerably accelerated the circulatory system. I sprang to the gun, which lay alongside of the rail, just within the side-board of the dray. \"I will sell my life dearly,\" I said to myself; \"but oh! if it must be—shall I never see home again?\" As I pulled back the hammer another cry, hardly so shrill—much more melodious, indeed, to my ears—sounded, and a flock of low-flying dark birds passed over my head. It was the cry of the wild swan! I was not sorry when I saw the hut fire, and drew up with my load near the yard. I had some trouble with my leader, the off-side bullock not caring to let me approach him, as is the manner of his kind. But I got over the difficulty, and dealt out retributive[Pg 57] justice by letting him and his mate go in their yoke, and postponing further operations to daylight. Mrs. Burge was most anxious about her husband, and inveighed against his foolishly putting his life in jeopardy for a few rails. Old Tom laughed, and said as long as Joe had a good gun he was a match for all the blacks in the country, if they did not take him by surprise. \"We\u0027re going to have a bit of trouble with these black varment now,\" he said, filling his pipe in a leisurely way. \"Once they\u0027ve started killing cattle they won\u0027t leave off in a hurry. More by token, they might take a fancy to tackle the hut some day when we\u0027re out.\" \"You leave me a gun, then,\" said Mrs. Burge, \"and I\u0027ll be able to frighten \u0027em a bit if I\u0027m left by myself. But sure, I hardly think they\u0027d touch me after all the flour and bits of things I\u0027ve given the lubras.\" \"They\u0027re quare people,\" said the old stockman, meditatively; \"there\u0027s good and bad among \u0027em, but the divil resave the blackfellow I\u0027d trust nearer than I could pull the trigger on him, if he looked crooked.\" I said little, being vexed that my policy of conciliation had been of no avail. I roused myself, however, out of a reverie on the curious problem afforded by original races of mankind, foredoomed to perish at the approach of higher law. \"They have not touched any of our cattle yet,\" I said; \"that shows they have some feeling of gratitude.\" \"I wouldn\u0027t say that,\" answered the old man.[Pg 58] \"I missed a magpie steer to-day, and I didn\u0027t see that fat yellow cow with the white flank. Thim\u0027s a pair that\u0027s always together, and I seen all the leading mob barrin\u0027 the two.\" \"We must have a hunt for them to-morrow,\" I said, \"and the sooner Joe comes in the better, Mrs. Burge.\" \"Yes, indeed,\" said that resolute matron, casting a glance at the cradle where lay a plump infant not many weeks old; \"and is there any other man in the country that would risk his life for a load of stock-yard rails? Not but it\u0027s elegant timber; only he might think of me and the baby.\" The argument was a good one, so next day I went out and forcibly brought away Joe and a final cargo of rails, though to the last he asserted \"that we were spoiling the yard for the sake of another week\u0027s splitting.\" I may here state that we got our stock-yard up in due time. It was seven feet high, and close enough—a rat could hardly get through. My share was chiefly the mortising of the huge posts, which afforded considerable scope for amateur execution, by reason of their size and thickness. If the yard is still standing—and nothing less than a stampede of elephants would suffice to level it—I could pick out several of \"my posts\" with unerring accuracy. \"God be with those days,\" as the Irish idiom runs; they were happy and free. I should like to be drafting there again—if the clock could be put back. But life\u0027s time-keeper murmurs sadly with rhythmic pendulum, \"Never—for ever: for ever—never!\" All of a sudden war broke out. The reasons for[Pg 59] this last resource of nations none could tell. The whites only wished to be let alone. They did not treat the black brother unkindly. Far from it. There were other philanthropists in the district besides myself, notably Mr. James Dawson, of Kangatong, then known as Cox\u0027s Heifer Station, distant about twenty miles to the east. Then, as now, my old friend and his amiable family were most anxious to ameliorate his condition. They fed and clothed the lubras and children. They even were sufficiently interested to make a patient study of the language, and to acquire a knowledge of tribal rites, ceremonies, and customs, which has lately been embodied in a valuable volume, praised even by the super-critical Saturday Review. It is a fact, not altogether without bearing on the historical analysis of pioneer squatting, that four of us—rude colonists, as most English writers persist in believing all Australian settlers to be—were, in greater or less degree, authors. Charles Macknight had a logically clear and trenchant way of putting things. As a political and social essayist he attracted much attention during the latter years of his life. His theories of stock-breeding, culled from contemporary journals, are still prized and acted upon by experienced pastoralists. Of the two brothers Aplin, the elder was a lover of scientific research, and, having a strong natural taste for geology, addressed himself to it with such perseverance that he became second only to Mr. Selwyn, the late Victorian Government geologist, a man of European reputation, and was himself enabled to fill the position of Government[Pg 60] geologist for Northern Queensland. His brother Dyson was a poet of by no means ordinary calibre. Mr. Dawson\u0027s book is now before the public, and the present writer has more than one book or two to his credit, which the public have been good enough to read, and reviewers to praise. Before I begin my history of the smaller Sepoy Rebellion, I must introduce Mr. Robert Craufurd, younger, of Ardmillan, a brother of the late Lord Ardmillan. This gentleman dwelt at Eumeralla East, a subdivision of the original run, which, in my time, was the property of the late Mr. Benjamin Boyd. The river divided the two runs. Messrs. Gorrie and M\u0027Gregor had acquired Eumeralla West, with its original homestead and improvements, by what we should call in the present day something very like \"jumping.\" However, I had no better claim to the Doghole-point, which was a part of the old Eumeralla run—as indeed was Dunmore and all the country within twenty or thirty miles—if the original occupant of that station was to be believed. The commissioner—the gallant and autocratic Captain Fyans—settled the matter, as was the wont of those days, by his resistless fiat. He \"gave\" Messrs. Gorrie and M\u0027Gregor the western side of the Eumeralla, with the homestead and the best fattening country. He restricted Mr. Boyd to the eastern side of the river, giving him his choice, however. That was the reason why Tinker Woods had to build new huts; and he eventually allotted to me Squattlesea Mere, and its dependencies, as far as the Doghole-point, though my friend, Bob Craufurd, on behalf[Pg 61] of his employer, strove stoutly to have me turned out. Mr. Craufurd, like other cadets of good family, had somewhat swiftly got rid of the capital which he imported, and, for lack of other occupation, accepted the berth of manager of Eumeralla East for Mr. Boyd, and a very good manager he was. A fine horseman, shrewd, clear-headed, and energetic on occasion, he did better for that enterprising ill-fated capitalist than he ever did for himself. He and the Dunmore people were old friends and schoolfellows. So, it may be guessed that we often found it convenient to exchange our somewhat lonely and homely surroundings for the comparative luxury and refinement of Dunmore. What grand evenings we used to have there! He was a special humourist. I often catch myself now laughing at one of \"Craufurd\u0027s stories\"—an inveterate practical joker, a thorough sportsman, a fair scholar, and scribbler of jeux d\u0027esprit, he was the life and soul of our small community. He once counterfeited a warrant, which he caused to be served on Mr. Cunningham for an alleged shooting of a blackfellow. Even that bold Briton turned pale (and a more absolutely fearless man I never knew) when he found himself, as he supposed, within the iron gripe of the law. We were all pretty good shots. For one reason or other the gun was rarely a day out of our hands. We were therefore in a position to do battle effectively for our homesteads and means of subsistence if these were assailed. Between my abode and the sea was but one other run—a cattle station. Sheep[Pg 62] were in the minority in those days. It was occupied by two brothers—the Messrs. Jamieson—Scots also; they seemed to preponderate in the west. Their run rejoiced in the aspiring title of Castle Donnington. It was rather thickly timbered, possessed a good deal of limestone formation, and had a frontage to Darlot\u0027s Creek, an ever-flowing true river which there ran into the sea.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1709/50330.html","bookId":1148,"book":{"id":1148,"title":"Old Melbourne Memories","description":"简介： These reminiscences of the early days of Melbournea city which, as a family, we helped to foundawakened, when first published in the columns of the Australasian, an amount of general interest most gratifying to the writer....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1709","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:28 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:28 AM"}}
