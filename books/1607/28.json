{"id":92876,"no":28,"title":"Page 28","content":"Two of the Savii as well as five members of the Minor Consiglio along with three advocates and a dozen witnesses attended the hearing of di Santo-Germano\u0027s petition and the accompanying complaint against the Venezian business factor, Gennaro Emerenzio. The room designated for this proceeding was on the second floor, not officially a courtroom, but in the building housing the secondary law courts, for it had not yet been determined what crime-if any-had been committed in the jurisdiction. Emerenzio was represented by Atanagio Moliner; Consiglier Decimo Ziane served as moderator for the presentation of witnesses. Di Santo-Germano had retained Thaddeo Valentin, a promising young advocate with a reputation for meticulousness. The morning-a fine, glistening autumn day with a rollicking breeze batting puffy clouds over the sky, but with chilly shadows-had begun well enough, with a parade of servants and gamesters all testifying that they had dealings with the absent Gennaro Emerenzio, and knew that when he was short of money, he would come upon a windfall that would enable him to continue gambling. There was a clear connection between the times that various of di Santo-Germano\u0027s enterprises suffered unaccountable set-backs and Emerenzio\u0027s remarkable infusions of money, while, although circumstantial, was good cause for suspicion, particularly since Emerenzio was no place to be found. In response, Moliner had parried these testimonies with witnesses such as Ulrico Baradin, the paper-broker, who claimed that most of di Santo-Germano\u0027s wealth was the result of confabulation among those who did not know him well; then Eugenio, who had served in di Santo-Germano\u0027s house and spied on him for the Consiglio, threw suspicion on di Santo-Germano\u0027s political sympathies, stating that the foreigner still maintained all manner of ties to foreign places in manners not beneficial to Venezia. The first mate of the Aphrodite, one of the Tedeshi\u0027s fleet, contended that, contrary to rumor, di Santo-Germano had not paid a full ransom for the crew of that ship when it was taken by corsairs, but only half the nine hundred ducats demanded for the men\u0027s release. Consiglier Decimo Ziane, a man of forty-five with a shock of gray hair and a distinguished manner, listened to the testimony, then consulted the standing clock in the far corner. \"How much more of this do you intend to offer to this hearing?\" \"We have four more witnesses, and a possible fifth,\" said Valentin. \"You have heard from di Santo-Germano\u0027s stewards and his printer, as well as the record-keepers at various gambling houses. I have yet to call Sanson Micheletta of the Casetta Santa Perpetua, and Padre Egidio Duradante, who is-\" Ziane raised his hand. \"We are all aware who Padre Duradante is.\" Valentin bowed slightly. \"Of course, of course. I meant nothing disrespectful.\" He indicated di Santo-Germano, seated alone in the rear of the room on an upholstered bench reserved for complainants. \"I trust you will not hold my inept remark against the man I represent.\" \"Understood.\" He looked at the first mate of the Aphrodite, saying, \"As the men were taken from a Tedeschi ship, I am astonished that di Santo-Germano paid any portion of the ransom, let alone half of it.\" He nodded to the advocates as the first mate rose from the Witnesses\u0027 Chair. \"Pray continue.\" Ziane sat back in his chair, straightening his official cap as he did. \"I will also call Baltassare Fentrin, who was steward to di Santo-Germano\u0027s mistress, and knows what hardships she faced as Emerenzio took the monies granted her for his own use.\" He bowed slightly. \"Also, I will call Lilio, her cook, who remained with her until there was no money left, to describe the depredations Emerenzio\u0027s thefts made upon her, and the reason he is convinced that Emerenzio has taken all the funds entrusted to him and absconded with them.\" \"That\u0027s four,\" said Ziane. \"Who is the possible fifth?\" \"Consiglier Orso Fosian.\" This statement caused a moment of silence in the room, which Valentin finally ended by saying, \"He has agreed to speak on this matter, and on the character of di Santo-Germano.\" \"Di Santo-Germano must be a commendable foreigner, to have a Consiglier appear on his behalf,\" said Moliner, raising his voice theatrically. \"Di Santo-Germano has conducted himself in a manner beyond reproach,\" said Valentin. \"Consiglieri should recognize honorable dealings when they encounter such, as an example to others.\" \"Prego, Signori,\" said Ziane, \"and you, Moliner-whom do you wish to call?\" His manner was offhanded but his authority completely clear. \"I have four more witnesses to call, Consiglier Ziane.\" Ziane considered all this, occasionally squinting as he assessed his options. After almost five minutes, he said, \"We will continue for another hour, and then stop for prandium and the midday rest. We will resume at four-of-the-clock. Call your witness, Valentin.\" \"Sanson Micheletta: I call Sanson Micheletta of the Casetta Santa Perpetua,\" said Valentin, glancing over his shoulder at di Santo-Germano to keep from looking at the witness, who rose from his chair and came reluctantly forward. \"If you will, take the Witnesses\u0027 Chair.\" Although he was ill-at-ease, Sanson did as he was told, crossed himself and vowed before God and the Repubblica, as a true Venezian, to speak the truth and only the truth. \"You are the owner and manager of the Casetta Santa Perpetua?\" Valentin asked. \"I am the manager; my share in the Casetta Santa Perpetua is forty percent.\" He tugged on the peplums of his doublet. \"And you are familiar with Gennaro Emerenzio?\" \"He has lost a considerable amount at my dice-tables,\" said Sanson. \"Would you say he lost more than he could afford to lose?\" Moliner asked, beginning his turn at questioning. \"Every month,\" said Sanson, trying to appear more comfortable than he was. \"Why do you assume that, if he regularly loses large amounts?\" Moliner made his inquiry sound like an accusation. \"Because he is a business factor,\" Sanson said as if the answer must be obvious to everyone, \"and I know of no other in his profession who can regularly lose a hundred ducats without suffering for such extravagance.\" \"But he paid his debts,\" Valentin began to pace, covering the space between the horseshoe-shaped array of chairs. \"Yes-sometimes he takes longer than is advisable, but he has always paid.\" Sanson cleared his throat and stared at the open shutters. \"Did he make settlements in large sums?\" Valentin pursued. \"In amounts in excess of fifty ducats, shall we say?\" \"Every quarter or so, he would settle all his debts and begin accumulating new ones,\" said Sanson, adding, \"He is one of those for whom gambling is a possession, almost a sickness that he cannot be cured of, no matter what remedy is tried. He ought to be exorcized, for unless he is, he will continue to gamble, though it be for wooden tokens, or pretty pebbles.\" \"Did he tell you where his money came from?\" Moliner approached the Witnesses\u0027 Chair, his face determined. Di Santo-Germano moved forward on the bench, his full attention on what Sanson was saying. \"He had no reason to do so,\" said Sanson, \"although he has often boasted that he has been paid a bonus for his good work. He told me once that he could, if he wished to, ruin more than a dozen men in Venezia, all of them rich foreigners.\" \"Did you have any reason to doubt him-that he had been paid a generous bonus?\" Moliner loomed over Sanson as he answered. \"I know of few men who have so many bonuses, or in such amounts as he has claimed. I had no doubts about his ability to ruin foreigners, either.\" Valentin took over once more. \"Then-given your understanding of this man and his situation-have you any idea of how he has come by the money he has used to pay debts?\" Sanson shrugged, a gesture made graceless by nervousness. \"I thought he was probably raking the trust accounts in his care: that would be the easiest way to line his pockets.\" \"By raking, you mean he was stealing from these accounts?\" Valentin stopped pacing as he waited for the answer. \"Yes. I mean stealing.\" Ziane leaned forward, looking directly at Sanson. \"Did you suspect this, and yet failed to report it?\" Now Sanson was squirming. \"I had no proof, only supposition,\" he said by way of excusing this lapse. \"I see,\" said Ziane, and motioned for the advocates to get on with it. \"I have nothing more to ask just now,\" said Moliner. \"Nor I,\" said Valentin. \"Not now.\" \"Then we will hear another witness,\" said Ziane. Moliner called Christofo Sen, and began by asking him if he had kept any records pertaining to di Santo-Germano. \"Of course. As I do of all foreigners in Venezia,\" he said crisply. \"Then you were aware that he has a number of business interests in Venezia?\" \"I am. We have information on all of them.\" He nodded to Ziane. \"I have presented that material, along with all the rest, to the Doge and the Minor Consiglio twice a year.\" \"I am aware of your excellent service,\" said Ziane, and signaled Valentin to commence. Sitting very still, di Santo-Germano wondered how Moliner had managed to shift the emphasis of the hearing from Emerenzio to him, making it appear that he deserved to have his fortune plundered. He had seen this kind of maneuvering several times in the past, and although it cast him in an unfavorable light, he was able to admire the skill required to have this persuasive impact. \"You say you reviewed di Santo-Germano\u0027s accounts-did you discover any irregularities about any of them?\" \"He appears to have lost a great deal of money suddenly. But merchants do have occasional high losses; every year, some few merchants endure serious failures. That is the nature of trading.\" Christofo Sen put his hands together as if to absolve himself from any malfeasance in the business. \"Did you have any reason to suppose that his factor had any part in these losses?\" Moliner asked. \"Why should I have had?\" Sen countered. \"And at no time did you think it necessary to inspect the manner in which Signor\u0027 Emerenzio kept his records?\" Moliner all but pounced on the words. Sen cleared his throat. \"I did not.\" From the back of the room di Santo-Germano regarded Christofo Sen with intense curiosity, aware that there was something askew about his testimony; he watched the witness, looking for small mannerisms to betray him. Valentin began his question with disarming mildness. \"Why is that-because di Santo-Germano is a foreigner?\" \"I would say that is not the primary reason: no,\" Christofo Sen answered coolly, lacing his hands together. \"The man has many diverse investments, and it isn\u0027t reasonable to think that every one of them is flourishing.\" He glowered toward the shadowy corner where di Santo-Germano sat. \"I know you have been most generous here in Venezia, and often I have wondered why.\" \"I will ask him that at the conclusion of our hearing,\" said Moliner, earning a look of remonstrance from Ziane. \"So it might be that you were less diligent with di Santo-Germano\u0027s records than you were with-shall we say-Consiglier Ziane\u0027s records?\" Valentin bowed his pardon to Ziane. \"I would not say less diligent, but perhaps not so well-informed, given that much of his money was not in this city,\" Christofo Sen declared. \"I have little intelligence on his businesses away from Venezia, except what he chooses to report.\" \"Did you do anything that might compromise di Santo-Germano in your records?\" Moliner asked. \"Not that I am aware of,\" said Sen, a look of unctuous satisfaction spreading over his visage. \"And you are satisfied that you could not specifically identify the thief as Gennaro Emerenzio?\" Moliner folded his hands in a display of patience. Sen glared at di Santo-Germano a second time, his gaze piercing the darkness as if to bring fell deeds to light. \"If there was any theft, I could not determine its source.\" Valentin studied Christofo Sen for a long moment, then asked, \"Do you have any reason to hold di Santo-Germano in such contempt as you appear to do?\" \"I do not hold him in contempt,\" said Sen. \"But you have said you agree with those who assert that di Santo-Germano had a hand in the kidnapping of your nephew, Leoncio, have you not? For I have a witness who has heard you say that.\" He cocked his head toward the keystone of the horseshoe chairs, where Consiglier Fosian sat. \"I may have said I counted him among several who might be inclined to harm my family. Why do you ask such things?\" Sen stamped his foot, half-rising to do so. \"It is hard enough that the lad should be missing, but to know nothing of what has become of him is the cruelest-\" Moliner was about to speak but Consiglier Ziane interrupted him. \"What reason did you suppose di Santo-Germano might have to abduct your nephew?\" Sen seemed at a loss for an answer. \"I should have supposed it was for ransom. My family would pay a great deal for Leoncio\u0027s return, and after all, di Santo-Germano\u0027s fortune is sadly depleted. Demanding a ransom for a youth from a good family would swiftly fill his coffers.\" Di Santo-Germano saw Christofo Sen\u0027s eyelids flicker, and he wondered why the secretary was dissembling. \"And have you received such a demand?\" Ziane inquired. \"If you have, I have heard nothing of it.\" \"No,\" said Sen. \"We have heard nothing.\" \"Don\u0027t you find that odd?\" Ziane asked as he waved Christofo Sen away from the Witnesses\u0027 Chair. Christofo Sen faltered. \"I hadn\u0027t considered it,\" he said stiffly. \"At first we all thought that Leoncio had decided to leave the city for reasons of his own. But when he didn\u0027t return, we made inquiries. We are still making inquiries, but have discovered nothing.\" \"You must be fearing the worst,\" said Ziane. \"I am not fearing anything,\" said Sen, and seeing the shocked expression on Ziane\u0027s face, he added, \"I am certain my nephew must be found, sooner rather than later, and when he is, he will tell us what happened to him, and we will take the proper measures to deal with those who wronged him.\" With a sardonic slant to his brow, Ziane said, \"I am sure all of us share your hope.\" He pointed to Valentin. \"Who next?\" \"Padre Egidio Duradante,\" said Valentin promptly, and motioned for the priest to come forward and take his oath. \"This all seems fairly redundant. I am a priest and enjoined to speak truthfully at all times,\" Padre Duradante said as he sat down, smoothing his silk-faille lucchetto with fussy little strokes of his well-groomed hands. \"But for the sake of formality, I will oblige the Consiglier.\" \"You know Gennaro Emerenzio, do you not?\" Valentin began. \"As a gamester, yes. Beyond that, no.\" The priest was being wary, and weighing his answers to volunteer as little as possible. \"You also know Leoncio Sen,\" Valentin said. \"Better than I know Gennaro Emerenzio,\" Padre Duradante replied, settling more comfortably into the Witnesses\u0027 Chair. Moliner studied Padre Duradante for a full minute, then asked, \"How well do you know di Santo-Germano?\" \"I know who he is, and I know he has a house on Campo San Luca. I have not been there, but Padre Bonnome has informed me about the household, including his long history of generosity to San Luca.\" \"Do you know anything about Gennaro Emerenzio\u0027s dealings with di Santo-Germano?\" Moliner held up his hand so that Padre Duradante would not answer yet. \"I don\u0027t ask you to reveal anything you have been told in confidence, yet I ask you to consider private discoveries as well as public ones.\" \"I would not compromise a confidence,\" said Padre Duradante disdainfully, fixing Moliner with a hard look. \"But in this case, there is little to tell: Emerenzio remarked to me, when di Santo-Germano left to go to the Lowlands?-he mentioned that di Santo-Germano had provided lavishly for all his Venezian ventures and dependents; he said all merchants should be so providential. Sometime later, Emerenzo said that the Lisbon earthquake had dealt di Santo-Germano a fearsome blow, and that it could be years before he recouped his losses.\" \"Would you suppose, from what you know for yourself, or have been told by reliable men, that Gennaro Emerenzio might stand to gain from his position as business-factor for di Santo-Germano?\" Valentin asked. \"I might surmise it,\" said Padre Duradante. Why, di Santo-Germano wondered, was Padre Duradante willing to offer so much information on Emerenzio\u0027s behalf, and so little to his benefit? \"At any point in your gambling with Emerenzio did you wonder about his money, and his losses?\" \"I don\u0027t usually think about the affairs of those with whom I gamble,\" said Padre Duradante, retreating into hauteur. \"But you have wondered if di Santo-Germano was in any way connected to Leoncio Sen\u0027s disappearance, have you not?\" Moliner took up his questioning again, this time with alacrity. \"That I have,\" said Padre Duradante. \"When I heard the fellow was missing, I wondered if it had anything to do with Pier-Ariana Salier, who had been in di Santo-Germano\u0027s protection until his fortune was lost; Leoncio desired her for himself, and sought to win her before she left this city to take up residence with a cousin. Leoncio vowed to find her and continue his solicitation of her favors, but that opportunity eluded him. Upon his return to Venezia, di Santo-Germano must have heard of Leoncio\u0027s suit, and when young Sen disappeared, I could not help but wonder what di Santo-Germano had to do with it, for Pier-Ariana returned to Venezia not long after Leoncio vanished, once again in di Santo-Germano\u0027s protection.\" \"Is there anyone who could corroborate your observations?\" Moliner asked, making no effort to hide his satisfaction at Padre Duradante\u0027s answer. \"There is one I am aware of-a rogue of a fellow-a spy called Basilio Cuor.\" He pursed his lips in a show of distaste. \"I gather the man has been following di Santo-Germano for some time: Leoncio told me Cuor had been ordered to follow di Santo-Germano to the Lowlands, and that he did so, providing his uncle\"-he nodded toward Christofo Sen-\"with reports of di Santo-Germano\u0027s activities there, including his assistance to Protestants, and rebellious women, against the order of the Spanish Crown.\" Valentin needed a little time to evaluate the implications of these remarks; he asked, \"This Basilio Cuor-do you trust him?\" Padre Duradante uttered a harsh laugh. \"Does anyone trust a spy?\" Valentin nodded. \"True enough-and yet you trust him enough to offer this hearing that man\u0027s mission to support your contention: why is that?\" Taken aback by this unexpected inquiry, Padre Duradante stammered, \"He ... he has been in the employ of the Consiglio, and they have been guided by his revelations.\" Moliner was ready with his next question, but was stopped when Consiglier Ziane intervened. \"A second-hand report on such important issues is not acceptable, even for such a hearing as this one. It appears that we must have testimony from this spy before I can reach any conclusion in regard to the case. Since he is not in attendance here, he must be found and summoned. Therefore we will stop now for prandium and I will send the footmen of the Minor Consiglio out to apprehend this Basilio Cuor, so he may appear before me and explain all he knows. I will have word sent to you as to when this hearing will resume. Be ready for this afternoon, but understand that it may take a day or two to find the man.\" Valentin and Moliner exchanged quick looks of alarm as they bowed to Consiglier Ziane, and when the Consiglier had left the chamber, Moliner said, \"I thought the matter was finished. Now this.\" \"The matter isn\u0027t finished,\" Valentin said, and motioned to di Santo-Germano, indicating they should meet in the corridor. While the witnesses filed out of the hearing room in unaccustomed silence, di Santo-Germano saw Christofo Sen let himself out of the side-door; this perplexed him, for he was not convinced that Sen was answering the summons of any of the Savii. Pondering what else Sen\u0027s behavior might imply, di Santo-Germano went into the corridor and waited beneath the tall window that poured light into the corridor. Valentin came up to him almost ten minutes later. \"I apologize for keeping you waiting, Conte; I was hoping to learn something useful about this Basilio Cuor. I am ignorant of the man and his dealings with Sen, and that troubles me.\" \"And what did you discover?\" di Santo-Germano inquired politely. \"Nothing of significance.\" Valentin paused briefly. \"Moliner tells me that he, too, was unaware of the man until now.\" \"Do you believe him?\" Taking the time to frame his answer, Valentin said, \"I believe Moliner did not know how much of a role this Cuor might play in the case, but I also believe he had heard the name before, and had been told a little about him.\" \"And what-if anything-does any of this have to do with Gennaro Emerenzio?\" di Santo-Germano asked. Valentin put his hands together. \"That is what we must determine,\" he said with an emotion made up of hope, uncertainty, and impatience, \"and we must do it before this hearing resumes.\" Text of a letter from Gennaro Emerenzio to Christofo Sen, carried personally by Benedetto Maggier of Le Rose. To Christofo Sen, senior secretary to the Savii da Mar, on this, the 2ndday of November, 1531. I have done your bidding a month since, forcing Leoncio to follow me until I was able to take him prisoner. Your nephew has doubtless reached the slave-markets of the Ottomites, and will not be returned to you, no matter what pleas he makes, for, as you instructed, I branded his forehead with the mark of a perjurer before delivering him into the hands of the Turks. No matter what he says, or what promises of ransom he vows will be paid for him, no one will believe him. You promised me when I undertook to work for you that all my debts would be paid or canceled if I shared my gleanings of di Santo-Germano\u0027s accounts and rid you of Leoncio; I have completed my part of the bargain, and yet you have not completed yours. I must have your pardon shortly, or I will be wholly without funds. If you think Benedetto Maggier will allow me to remain here clandestinely without the required payment for his silence and his attic, you misunderstand the man. If I cannot pay his fee, he will expose me to the officers of the court, and collect the reward that is presently offered for my seizure by the court. Do not suppose that if I am captured that I will keep your secret for you-I would use everything I know of your pilferage and your nephew\u0027s extortion attempts to ensure that my sentence is kept low, and I would rejoice in knowing that you would be incarcerated with me for hiring me to dispose of your nephew, as well as your accepting stolen money from me. You and I have done damnable things, and for the sake of my soul, I will confess every aspect of my part, as well as the role you played in my raking of trust accounts, as well as the profit you made from my actions. The court will have sufficient reason to charge you with several crimes, as I will testify. I will wait until midday tomorrow for your response; if I hear nothing after that time, I will go to di Santo-Germano, and ask him to accompany me-I will then present myself to Consiglier Ziane and beg for his mercy. Give this your close consideration, and then send me word of your decision. In the high regard you deserve, Gennaro Emerenzio","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/states-of-grace-saint-germain-18/page-28.html","bookId":1607,"book":{"id":1607,"title":"States of Grace (Saint-Germain #18)","description":"Storyline: States of Grace (Saint-Germain #18) Franzicco Ragoczy di Santo-Germano is a successful merchant in Venice.
