His lavish lifestyle and rumored cache of magnificent jewels have attracted the wrong sort of attention, and without Santo-Germano\u0027s noble--and papal--connections, he might be imprisoned, his property confiscated. Also under surveillance is the vampire\u0027s mistress, the lovely and talented musician Pier-Ariana Salier. Elsewhere, Ragoczy\u0027s publishing business is being investigated by the Inquisition. Erneste van Amsteljaxter, a writer whose intelligence Ragoczy finds attractive, is tarred with the brush of heresy. Ragoczy is trying to help her, when he learns that Pier-Ariana has disappeared. Back in Venice Santo-Germano finds that his fortune has been embezzled, and that he is accused of kidnapping, and possibly murdering, a young man who had been spying on the vampire and his mistress. Another spy has discovered Santo-Germano\u0027s true nature and intends to kill him before he can feast on all of Venice!","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/states-of-grace-saint-germain-18.jpg","author":"Chelsea Quinn Yarbro","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":30,"category":{"id":7,"name":"Science Fiction","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
