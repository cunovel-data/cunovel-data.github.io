{"id":92868,"no":20,"title":"Page 20","content":"Text of a letter from Rudolph Eschen in Amsterdam to Germain Ragoczy, Grav Saint-Germain, in care of his steward Simeon Roosholm in Antwerp, with instructions to forward it to Saint-Germain at his present location, delivered to Roosholm by private courier four days after it was written. To the Grav the most honorable Germain Ragoczy of Saint-Germain, this from the advocate Rudolph Eschen, on this, the 2ndday of July, 1531, from Amsterdam. Grav: I have in hand all the deeds, trusts, and transfers you brought to me three days since, along with your instructions in their regard, hard upon your departure from this city, and I am writing now to confirm those instructions so that you may review and modify them according to your wishes before I proceed with enacting them. Item: to give full and unqualified support to Mercutius Christermann so that he may continue to keep Eclipse Press in operation as long as the city laws and the Church will allow it; for the running of the press, you allocate the sum of ten ducats a month, for supplies and similar expenses, another five ducats, to be paid from your account at the van Wech Trading Trust, and from the Foreign Merchants Depository. For Christermann himself, you authorize five ducats a month, to allow him to live in reasonable comfort. To those pressmen and others who have elected to leave your employ, you have instructed me to provide a month\u0027s wages as part of their release: this is another example of your admirable character but I would be remiss in my duty if I did not tell you that I am not in favor of such munificence. Regarding the continuing publications from Eclipse Press, you expect Christermann to produce at least four books in a year, and if he undertakes a more ambitious program, to adjust his funds accordingly. You have arranged for your books to be carried on your ships for sales abroad, the numbers and titles to be recorded here and where sales take place. I have executed the final copy of the contract you made with Christermann, permitting him to hire such men as he needs to produce the books scheduled and in preparation, with your admonition that he is to use his best judgment where your previous workers are concerned. I must tell you again, Grav, as your advocate, that I believe you are being too generous to those men who allowed themselves to be bullied into leaving your company. I repeat my previous advice-give them nothing, not even a recommendation, as they have done nothing to deserve your assistance. Also, as this Christermann is untested on his own, I would advise giving him a less free-handed amount of money until he has proven he is capable of fulfilling his tasks. I can think of few businessmen who would not second my admonition. Item: to Erneste van Amsteljaxter, unconditional life tenancy of your house, for herself and such companions as she may wish to have receive her hospitality, with such funds as are needed to maintain the building and the household, to hire such new servants as may be needed, and to make such changes in the house as may be prudent. In addition, you offer her the right to use the house in any way that suits her, as long as it is in accord with the law. You permit her to house those four women who were wounded in the so-called Women\u0027s Revolt at the end of May for as long as it suits her, with no restrictions put upon her because of what many may see as an endorsement of an illegal act. In spite of this imprudent support of rebellious wool-workers, you have given her autonomy over the property for the duration of her life, as well as the use of your town carriage and your coachman, and your barge and bargeman, for which you will pay wages and maintenance. You also provide her with an annual grant of one hundred ducats so that she may be free to write and study as she wishes. You also wish to provide the funds for erecting a headstone for her Aunt Evangeline, of which I shall inform Deme van Amsteljaxter within the week. Item: for Bogardt van Leun, an annual stipend of twenty ducats beyond his usual salary, and the promise that he and his wife will have employment in your Amsterdam household for as long as they so desire, with the use of the cottage you own to the southeast of the city when he reaches the age of forty-five, when he will be eligible to retire from your service without loss of pay either to himself or his wife. You also propose to pay for the education of any children, male or female, they may have. Item: to Dries Altermaat, the authority to conduct business in your name as official factor for Eclipse Trading and Mercantile Company, with such sums as are needed to keep the company ships in good repair, ditto the warehouses, to provide reasonable sums for such demands of business may require, and sixty ducats per year for his work: this on condition that the trading accounts of Eclipse Trading and Mercantile Company be scrutinized and verified semiannually, with penalties for any irregularity beyond the amount of ten ducats. He is to work in regular consultation with your dispatcher and warehouse supervisors, and to provide monthly reports on those matters, along with inventories, to my office for my perusal, and my promise that any dispute in facts and figures will be addressed promptly. This last is, in my opinion, a very sensible provision, and I am pleased to see you have decided to include this element of restraint in your unusual magnanimity; few businessmen in Amsterdam are either so wealthy as you, or so willing to spend with your unselfishness. I will not refuse to follow your orders, but I would not be fulfilling my responsibilities to you if I did not remark on my reservations, especially in regard to your fortune, considerable though it may be. You may say that it is your practice, because of your long absences, not to restrict those in your employ by not allowing for unforeseen events; while that is all very well, you will permit me to observe that what you deem advisable I can only see as extravagant and possibly reckless, for your very largesse invites those in your employ to take advantage of you. With that for a caveat, I will carry out your instructions in every particular. Item: for any in your household or business brought before either civil or religious tribunals in this city, I have in hand one hundred fifty ducats to provide for the defense of any requiring it, and the bond that the court may require on their behalf, with the added assurance that should such a detention occur, I will notify you by private courier at once, with an account of the charges and the likely progress of the case, insofar as it is possible for me to determine such. You guarantee me an additional three hundred ducats if so great a sum is needed. As agreed, I will tender you quarterly reports regarding your businesses and property in this city, as well as any actions, requests, or changes from your household, your press, and your trading company. I will use the courier you have paid for, and I will act within three days on any crucial development to apprise you of each and every significant change in regard to those actions and accusations. Insofar as my acts are in accord with the law, I will assure you that I will honor my fiduciary responsibilities as laid out above. With every wish for your continued good health and prosperity, I am always at your service, Rudolph Eschen Advocate-at-law By my own hand: a witnessed copy of this letter is included among my records of our association.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/states-of-grace-saint-germain-18/page-20.html","bookId":1607,"book":{"id":1607,"title":"States of Grace (Saint-Germain #18)","description":"Storyline: States of Grace (Saint-Germain #18) Franzicco Ragoczy di Santo-Germano is a successful merchant in Venice. His lavish lifestyle and rumored cache of magnificent jewels have attracted the wrong sort of attention, and without Santo-Germano\u0027s noble--and papal--connections, he might be imprisoned, his property confiscated. Also under surveillance is the vampire\u0027s mistress, the lovely and talented musician Pier-Ariana Salier. Elsewhere, Ragoczy\u0027s publishing business is being investigated by the Inquisition. Erneste van Amsteljaxter, a writer whose intelligence Ragoczy finds attractive, is tarred with the brush of heresy. Ragoczy is trying to help her, when he learns that Pier-Ariana has disappeared. Back in Venice Santo-Germano finds that his fortune has been embezzled, and that he is accused of kidnapping, and possibly murdering, a young man who had been spying on the vampire and his mistress. Another spy has discovered Santo-Germano\u0027s true nature and intends to kill him before he can feast on all of Venice!","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/states-of-grace-saint-germain-18.jpg","author":"Chelsea Quinn Yarbro","type":"Science Fiction","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/states-of-grace-saint-germain-18.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:46 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 5:58:06 PM"}}
