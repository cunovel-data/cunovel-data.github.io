{"id":92861,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"Bruges was blustery, with sharp winds off the North Sea cutting along the streets and shrieking down chimneys, sapping the last of autumn\u0027s warmth and replacing it with the promise of an early winter. Occasional patches of blue shone through the racing clouds, lending an evanescent cheer to the waning day.\n Coming through the door on a shove of the northwesterly wind, Ruthger nodded to Jaquet Saint Philemon, who had hurried to answer the knock on the door, saying, \"I\u0027d wish you good afternoon, Saint Philemon, but it certainly isn\u0027t, if the weather is any test of the matter.\" He swung his knee-length, fur-trimmed, mulberry-colored chamarre off his shoulders, revealing a short, old-fashioned huque in double-woven English wool of russet-brown over knee-length pin-tucked barrel-hose in dull satin of raw ocher; his leggings were dark-gold and his high-topped shoes were made of Cordovan leather. He handed the chamarre to the steward, going on, \"Maarten Gerben will be here within the hour to see my master. I trust I may find him in his study?\"\n \"Yes,\" said Saint Philemon, giving his cuff-bands a fussy twist. \"He left his apartment about two hours ago, and went to his study as soon as he had been given the cards left for him.\"\n \"Thank you.\" Ruthger started toward the stairs to the second floor, then stopped. \"The tailor is coming around later today, shortly before sunset, delivering two new suits of clothes-one for my master and one for me, and taking measurements for others.\"\n Saint Philemon had a short, fierce, inner debate, then remarked, \"That will be of benefit; aside from your chamarre, your garments are not in the current mode, except for your Venezian clothing, and such is not appropriate here. You will be glad of what the tailor brings you.\"\n Ruthger came close to laughing. \"Just so.\"\n \"You will want to be notified when he arrives, I would suppose,\" said Saint Philemon, setting the door-latch with care; it would not do to have the wind blow it open.\n \"Yes, and when Gerben arrives,\" said Ruthger.\n \"I\u0027ll attend to it,\" said Saint Philemon, going to fetch a footman to keep watch on the door.\n Ruthger climbed the stairs to the second floor; they were not so steep as the stairs in the house on Campo San Luca, but they made up for this in their narrowness. As Ruthger continued upward, he decided that another oil-lamp in the stairwell would relieve its constant gloom, and determined to instruct Saint Philemon to secure one to the wall at the first small square step that served as a landing. At the top of the second flight, Ruthger took the corridor leading southeast and tapped on the double doors at its end.\n \"Come in, old friend,\" called the voice from inside.\n Ruthger turned the latch and stepped through the double doors: Saint-Germain\u0027s study was the largest room in the house, set at the back of the building, over the kitchens. There were two trestle-tables, a book-stand, two tall stools, and three closed cabinets, along with two chairs, and an upholstered bench facing the hearth where this afternoon a small fire burned. Saint-Germain himself was perched on one of the stools at the larger of the two tables, a small beam-scale suspended from his hand, the greatest portion of his attention fixed on the two objects he was weighing, one a brass spool, the other a haphazard knob of gold. He wore an English doublet in black-silk twill, piped in silver, with a narrow ruff of exquisite point-lace. His barrel-hose were a bit shorter than Ruthger\u0027s, made of polished satin, and leggings of black silk; although he was a decade out of the current fashion, he had lost none of his elegance. \"Well enough for a first effort,\" he said as much to himself as to Ruthger as he tossed the gold into the air and caught it. \"The athanor will need some minor repairs.\"\n Ruthger waited until Saint-Germain set the scale down, then said, \"Gerben is coming today. I persuaded him that he would do better, speaking with you directly, than continuing this endless exchange of messages. There is going to be confusion or an interception if you continue as you have.\"\n \"Excellent,\" Saint-Germain approved. \"I will be glad to receive him at last.\"\n \"He asked me to warn you that he is being watched,\" Ruthger added.\n \"As are most printers in Bruges,\" Saint-Germain observed, taking care to speak the local dialect in case any of his household might be listening.\n \"That they are,\" said Ruthger. \"But that does not mean we should be unmindful of it.\"\n Saint-Germain swung around on the stool to face Ruthger. \"You have the right of it, of course. We do not want to add ... ah ... fuel to the fire.\" His sardonic witticism held a grim reminder of the printers and book-makers whose businesses had been burned to the ground during the last two years by various outraged mobs rampaging through the city.\n \"By no means,\" said Ruthger with a trace of acerbic amusement on his features.\n \"Is Gerben concerned for his bindery?\" Saint-Germain asked. \"Or is it the press itself that he worries for?\"\n \"What printer in the Low Countries would not be concerned for both?\" Ruthger countered, and went on in Venezian Italian, \"He did his utmost to present the appearance of confidence and composure, but his eyes flickered often and he jumped at sudden sounds. His clothes are loose on his frame, so I must suppose he has recently lost weight, yet he doesn\u0027t appear to be ill, only troubled.\"\n \"I see,\" said Saint-Germain thoughtfully in the same tongue. \"What more did you notice?\"\n \"His shop is short handed,\" Ruthger reminded him, \"and he has only two apprentices now: last year-\"\n \"-he had four,\" Saint-Germain finished for him. \"That is discouraging, at least for him.\"\n \"At least,\" Ruthger seconded. \"He lost one apprentice to high fever and putrid bowels, but the other left for Mass one day and never returned.\"\n \"Kidnapped, does he think?\" Saint-Germain asked.\n \"Not kidnapped: he fears the lad was taken by the Secular Arm of the Church, and is being held in one of the monastery prisons,\" Ruthger said, his emotions carefully banked. \"It\u0027s that, or he fled the country.\"\n \"Had he done anything to merit such attention?\" Saint-Germain inquired, an edge in his voice as he tossed the gold again, and caught it, then set it on the table.\n \"Gerben didn\u0027t say, but he thought that the youth had been working with some comrades to print up broadsheets-you know, the kind that are posted on walls throughout the city, most inflammatory in their rhetoric, inciting disputes and conflict among the various local religious factions.\" Ruthger paused. \"Until they are white-washed over or torn down.\"\n Saint-Germain gave a single nod. \"It is not something about which Gerben may safely make inquiries, if that is the case. Neither the civil nor the religious authorities take well to those who spread dissension among the people, and small wonder. Gerben\u0027s oppugns on the apprentice\u0027s behalf could lead to his interrogation for making inquiry.\"\n \"Assuming, if he were not detained, he would be told anything at all,\" added Ruthger.\n \"Yes; assuming that,\" said Saint-Germain, getting down from his stool and pacing the length of his study. \"It is getting worse, is it not?\" he asked from the far end of the room.\n Ruthger had been with Saint-Germain long enough to know that he meant the tension between religious groups. \"Yes, and it will not soon be better.\"\n \"No, I fear not,\" said Saint-Germain, picking up the gold and holding it to the light. \"Seven ounces, English weight. I was hoping for ten.\"\n \"Seven ounces is not a small amount,\" Ruthger remarked as he took the lump of gold Saint-Germain had made in the athanor.\n \"If matters were more settled, then I would agree,\" Saint-Germain said.\n \"But you\u0027re worried,\" said Ruthger.\n \"That I am,\" said Saint-Germain in the dialect of Bruges. \"This city is like a pot on the simmer. It could soon boil over, and that could mean more hardship than most citizens now endure. Spain is proving a hard master for their Netherlands, and Clemente is unlikely to rein in any Hapsburg, not since the Spanish sacked Roma.\"\n \"Do you think the Church will try to bring the city to heel?\" Ruthger sighed.\n \"Spain would doubtless like to make such an attempt, and the Church might permit it, but the Holy Roman Emperor would not countenance so oppressive a course, or so it appears.\" Saint-Germain glanced toward the door, aware of a soft sound beyond it. He signaled to Ruthger, and then went on, \"Protestants are more tolerated by the Austrian Hapsburgs than the Spanish Hapsburgs, though they are all ruled by the same man.\"\n \"Does that lessen or increase the instability, do you think?\" Ruthger moved a few steps nearer the door.\n \"It is too soon to say,\" said Saint-Germain. \"If the Spanish have their way, there will be blood in the streets and then the chance for negotiated resolution will be lost. You know how these confrontations escalate: we have seen it before.\"\n Ruthger put his hand lightly on the door-latch. \"How many more times will this happen?\"\n \"Pitting faith against faith?\" Saint-Germain came back down the chamber. \"As long as the gods are a mystery, or so I fear.\"\n At his signal, Ruthger opened the door, to find Oton Marchand, the senior footman, standing close to it. \"So!\" Ruthger said. \"You carry a message?\"\n Oton colored to the roots of his fair hair. \"I ... I ... that is ... No message.\" This admission ended on a brusque sigh.\n \"So you were listening.\" No one moved as Saint-Germain regarded Oton steadily for a short while. Then, apparently satisfied, he said, \"Well, you are come in good time. I have an errand for you.\"\n \"Certainly,\" said Oton in a rush of an emotion that might have been gratitude. \"Whatever you require.\"\n Saint-Germain saw the flick of Ruthger\u0027s eye, but continued on as if he had not. \"Have a plate of sausage and cheese made ready, and bring a pitcher of beer and a tankard, if you will.\"\n \"Certainly,\" said Oton, and started away from Saint-Germain, his features twisted in dismay. \"Your pardon, Grav; I should not have-\"\n \"You will need another tub of wood if you want to keep your fire going,\" Ruthger pointed out.\n Saint-Germain offered a rueful smile. \"Thank you for noticing. Yes, by all means, have a tub of wood sent up, Oton. It would not do for me to receive Gerben in a cold room.\"\n Ruthger nodded as Oton hastened away, \"I wonder to whom he reports?\" He did not expect an answer. \"I\u0027ll go to the kitchen to get your tray, and leave you to prepare your dispatch to Gennaro Emerenzio; the courier will be here in an hour.\"\n \"You are good to remind me,\" said Saint-Germain, ducking his head as if chagrined by his lapse in memory; he reached into a drawer under the table and pulled out a sealed envelope, which he handed to Ruthger. \"This should be sufficient. The courier is one of Belfountain\u0027s, or one we have hired here?\"\n \"Yes; one of Belfountain\u0027s. As part of the retaining contract I struck with him on your behalf.\" He slipped the envelope inside his doublet, frowning a bit, then said, \"If anyone should inquire, am I at liberty to reveal the terms of your agreement with Belfountain?\"\n Saint-Germain\u0027s glint of a smile told Ruthger that he had been right: Saint-Germain wanted any household spies to know about his arrangements with private couriers. \"Certainly, if they have good reason to ask for it.\"\n With a slight nod, Ruthger left the room, securing the latch before going back down the narrow stairs to the main floor, and from there along the corridor to the kitchen.\n Wenzel Horner, the chief cook, was a man of moderate height, but with shoulders and forearms like a blacksmith. Just now he busy cutting up cabbage for the pork stew cooking in the large pot hung over the coals in the maw of the fireplace. He looked up as Ruthger came in. \"It\u0027s you, is it? What am I to do for the Grav?\"\n \"He would like a tray sent up for his visitor-when the visitor arrives,\" said Ruthger. \"Sausage, cheese, and beer.\"\n \"I have a barrel we have just tapped; it is better than many barrels have been of late.\" Wenzel yawned. \"Is that all the Grav needs me to do?\"\n \"Don\u0027t feel unappreciated,\" said Ruthger. \"My master\u0027s privacy in his dining is the custom among his people. Do not feel offended that he does not avail himself of your excellent cooking.\"\n Wenzel sniffed. \"One would think he has no consequence at all-he never has guests to dine, and he, himself, keeps his own company for his meals, whatever they may be.\"\n \"It is the way of those of his blood,\" said Ruthger in a tone that deflected any further pursuit on the cook\u0027s part.\n Wenzel scraped the chopped cabbage into a bowl. \"I have applebread in the warming ovens, or does that tempt you?\"\n \"Alas,\" said Ruthger, and then said, \"But I am sure my master\u0027s visitor would like to have it with his sausage and cheese.\"\n \"I will see he has a slice or two,\" Wenzel said magnanimously.\n Knowing that the cook\u0027s pique had been mollified, Ruthger left the kitchen, bound for the steward\u0027s quarters, where he spent a short while in reviewing the household accounts with Saint Philemon. By the time he returned to the kitchen, he had handed off the envelope to Belfountain\u0027s courier and received a note from the butcher, saying that there were fresh lambs in the market. As he approached Wenzel to arrange about shopping, he was informed word had come from Oton that the printer Gerben had arrived and was waiting in the vestibule. Making a rapid decision, Ruthger said, \"Have Oton escort Gerben to the Grav\u0027s study. I will bring the refreshments up to them.\"\n The page who rushed to do this was a lad of eleven called Joris who often spent his afternoons with Wenzel in the kitchen, learning the secrets of cooking, and playing solitary games with ladles and forks. He was an ambitious, eager boy, all elbows and knees and restless energy, whose only living relative was an uncle serving aboard a merchant-ship.\n \"That boy has a very high opinion of you,\" said Ruthger, a hint of warning in his voice.\n \"He\u0027s clever enough; in a year or two, I may make him my apprentice, if his interest hasn\u0027t waned,\" said Wenzel, trundling over to the cast-iron oven and taking out one of four loaves of bread, holding it with the tips of his fingers to avoid being burned; he went to the chopping board beside the tray on which sat a plate of sausages fresh from the oven, next to two large wedges of cheese, one white, one dull-gold.\n \"No doubt he will be a credit to you, if you don\u0027t abuse his esteem for you,\" said Ruthger. \"Lonely boys can credit those they value with virtues no one man can possess.\"\n \"You have some experience in this?\" Wenzel said as he took a knife and began to slice the loaf.\n \"Yes. Years ago,\" he said, not adding that it had been over thirteen centuries since Marius\u0027 devotion to him had brought about the youngster\u0027s death in the terrible riots that had inflamed Roma at the end of the reign of Heliogabalus.\n \"I wouldn\u0027t have thought you were a man to be influenced by the adulation of a child.\" Wenzel set the sliced bread in a small basket and covered it with a square of linen.\n \"I believe I was missing my son,\" said Ruthger, and added, \"He died-many, many years ago.\"\n Wenel\u0027s laugh was short and sarcastic. \"You had a son?\"\n \"I had,\" said Ruthger, and volunteered nothing more as he picked up the tray Wenzel had finished loading. \"The beer?\"\n With a snap of his fingers, Wenzel hurried to the outer pantry, disappeared only to return almost immediately with a large stoneware pitcher filled with dark, fragrant beer. \"There.\" He held it out and then reached for a tankard to put on the tray. \"May the printer have a good appetite.\"\n \"Amen,\" said Ruthger, and started toward the backstairs, bound for Saint-Germain\u0027s study.\n Maarten Gerben was seated facing the fire, his big hands extended to the fire, revealing permanent ink-stains on his nails and knuckles. He was in his late twenties, thick-bodied and round-faced, in somber-but-prosperous clothing in dark-gray English wool. Although his features were clearly often cheerful, his expression now was reticent and fretful. He stopped speaking as Ruthger came into the room, giving a quick, anxious glance at Saint-Germain.\n Saint-Germain was standing behind the second chair, leaning easily on the high back of it. He signaled Ruthger to set the tray down within Gerben\u0027s reach. \"You may say what you like in front of Ruthger,\" he told Gerben calmly. \"He has my complete confidence. You may rely utterly on his discretion.\"\n \"I am sure you may do so,\" said Gerben with a slight emphasis on you.\n \"And you, as well,\" said Saint-Germain, indicating the tray.\n \"After your examination by the Archbishop\u0027s Council, you can still put such trust in the man?\" Gerben marveled.\n \"I am not in prison, and they questioned Ruthger as well as several others in the household. And you,\" said Saint-Germain. \"He said nothing to my discredit then, nor would he now.\"\n Gerben hunched his shoulders. \"Other men have misplaced their trust.\"\n \"So they have, and I have been one of them, upon occasion,\" Saint-Germain agreed, sensing this was as much a ploy as a complaint. \"Help yourself to anything you like.\"\n \"Will you not join me?\" Gerben asked, looking hungrily at the plump, hot sausages.\n \"Thank you, no.\" He came around the chair to sit down. \"If you will, tell me more about the problems you\u0027ve been having.\"\n Gerben rubbed his hands together. \"It is just the same for printers throughout Bruges, and the rest of the Low Countries under the heel of Spain.\" He reached to pour himself a tankard of beer, but stopped, as if worried about being overheard.\n \"That is becoming more apparent with every passing day,\" said Saint-Germain.\n \"You have the right of it,\" said Gerben, reaching for the fork to prong one of the sausages; as the tines penetrated the casing, three little spurts of grease gushed out. \"Oh, excellent,\" he approved as he lifted the sausage to bite the end off.\n \"I will tell the cook,\" Ruthger said solemnly.\n \"Yes; do,\" said Gerben, chewing steadily, the first signs of pleasure softening the hard lines in his face.\n Ruthger nodded and stepped back. \"Is there anything more?\" he asked Saint-Germain.\n \"Not at present, no, thank you.\" He glanced toward the door. \"Perhaps you will return in half an hour?\"\n Understanding that this meant he was not to go far, Ruthger bowed slightly. \"That I will.\"\n As soon as the door closed behind Ruthger, the satisfaction vanished from Gerben\u0027s countenance. \"You must be careful. Even trusted servants have been known to trade their masters for freedom. Keep all secrets to yourself, and no one can reveal them to your disadvantage.\"\n \"I have no such worry on Ruthger\u0027s part, but I will be careful of the rest,\" said Saint-Germain, aware that the printer had good reason for such a warning.\n \"You must,\" said Gerben urgently. \"In the last month two of my friends-men with presses of their own-have had their books seized, and they themselves have been put in prison for seditious activities. Their authors have left the country. And, for that matter, so have most of mine.\" He scowled ferociously. \"One of my remaining apprentices has said he is going to sign on a ship bound for the New World. There are fortunes waiting for men with talent, he tells me, and he will not have to feel the Church looking over his shoulder all the time.\"\n \"Is he planning to be a printer in the New World?\" Saint-Germain asked tranquilly.\n \"I don\u0027t think so,\" Gerben said, and finished his sausage. \"He says a man who can read and write can become a copyist or a notary, and in time, an advocate, and they will need such men as the New World becomes civilized.\" The recitation of these optimistic plans made him more morose; he speared a second sausage.\n \"Have you found a replacement for him?\" Saint-Germain guessed this was the reason for Gerben\u0027s despondency.\n \"I thought I had,\" said Gerben. \"But the boy\u0027s father has changed his mind since the recent detentions. He\u0027s apprenticed the lad to an apothecary.\" This time his bite was emphatic, an outward manifestation of his inner demoralization.\n \"Always a useful profession,\" Saint-Germain murmured.\n \"But it points the way, don\u0027t you see?\" Gerben pleaded. \"It shows that anyone printing any books may be held accountable for what they say, or what they are deemed to say, and the Church imposes many things on those who try to present any material that does not-\" He stopped and took a long drink of beer. \"I apologize, Grav. I have been so ... so ...\"\n \"Distraught?\" Saint-Germain suggested. \"I can see that.\"\n Gerben took another long drink. \"I have cause for my concern, wouldn\u0027t you agree?\"\n \"Yes, I would,\" said Saint-Germain, sensing that Gerben was trying to come to the point of his visit.\n \"Yes.\" He took a deep breath. \"I wish to ask you, keeping all these things in mind-\" He stopped suddenly. \"I mean, if you would only consider my situation. I wish to continue in this work, more than anything else, but I am afraid that it may lead me into trouble-trouble that would prevent me doing anything more of use, either as a printer, or as a man.\" He sagged in his chair, as if what he had said had deflated him.\n \"I gather you would like to move your press to another city,\" said Saint-Germain.\n Staring at Saint-Germain as if astonished that he had achieved so much in that hectic outburst, he said, \"Yes. I would.\"\n \"Have you a locale in mind?\" Saint-Germain asked.\n \"I do,\" said Gerben. \"I have written to a merchant who has warehouses on the Channel Islands. He has said that in return for my keeping records and inventories of his cargos stored there, he will permit me to set up my press in the smallest of his warehouses.\"\n \"The Channel Islands,\" Saint-Germain repeated slowly. \"Have you chosen the one you prefer?\"\n \"Jersey,\" said Gerben, so quickly that Saint-Germain suspected he had made up his mind just now. \"King Henry-who is Duke there-may be having his difficulties with Rome and the Pope, but I doubt those conflicts will touch the Channel Islands.\"\n \"If Henry Tudor prevails, I think you may be right,\" said Saint-Germain. \"I gather you want my permission to do this, and my support.\"\n Now Gerben looked sheepish. \"Well, yes, Grav, for if I lose your patronage, I cannot make this move, or any move.\"\n \"Ah,\" said Saint-Germain, and leaned forward in his chair. \"I do not expect you to put your work and your life at risk for my sake. If you have found that it is too dangerous to do your work here in Bruges, then, by all means, find a safer place to go, and with my good wishes, if you need them. I will continue my support of your press for as long as you continue to publish.\"\n Gerben\u0027s chuckle was weak from this assuagement. \"I was prepared to have to do much more than this,\" he admitted before he emptied his tankard and hurriedly refilled it.\n Saint-Germain regarded the printer in silence for a short while, then said, \"As soon as you have made your arrangements, notify me, and you will be provided the funds you need for your move.\" He wondered why the merchant with the warehouses had not extended his beneficence to sponsorship as well, but decided not to add to Gerben\u0027s distress; he listened attentively while Gerben expounded on his plans for his press, so that when Ruthger returned, as he had said he would, he discovered Gerben talking animatedly, his food half-eaten, and Saint-Germain giving him his full attention, a slight, contemplative smile the only indication of his thoughts.\n Text of an accounting from Giules d\u0027Attigny, tailor of Bruges, to Grav Saint-Germain.\n Most excellent Grav,\n I hereby submit my bill, with an accounting for the clothes I have made for you in the last three weeks, with added amounts for putting other work aside in order to finish your garments before your departure for Antwerp.
