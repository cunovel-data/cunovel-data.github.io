{"id":63343,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"\"My lady!\" Cecily hurried forward and began to crawl across the remains of the collapsed bed toward her. \"Are you all right?\\n\\n Were you hurt?\"\\n\\n \"Nay. I am fine.\" Murie sat up to peer around and forced a smile for the woman, but was unable to maintain it and finally let her breath unhappily out. The room looked no better from this angle than it had standing.\\n\\n \"There most-like were no fresh linens to replace these anyway,\" Cecily said as she peered at the ruined bed, wrinkling her nose. \"It seems little enough is done around here, I doubt laundry is at the top of their list of concerns.\"\\n\\n Murie frowned, not having thought of it herself, and then her gaze swiveled to the door Cecily had left open. Men began to cart in her chests.\\n\\n \"Oh.\" The first man paused sharply as he spotted the pair on the ruined bed, forcing the others to an abrupt halt as well. The four men simply stood there staring for a moment, and then one said, \"We can fix it.\"\\n\\n \"Do not bother,\" Cecily began. \"We have no - \"\\n\\n \"Aye, do,\" Murie countered, scrambling quickly up. Cecily followed.\\n\\n \"But, my lady - \"\\n\\n \"There may be linens in one of my chests,\" Murie interrupted hopefully.\\n\\n \"What?\" Cecily said. \"I hardly think - \"\\n\\n \"Everyone at court knew Gaynor was in a bad way,\" Murie pointed out. She rushed over to the first chest the men were now setting down and threw the lid open to begin rifling through the contents. \"The queen may have had the forethought to send some of my own linens with me in case they were needed. Queen Phillippa is very good with such details.\"\\n\\n \"But...\" Cecily\u0027s words died on her lips as Murie gave a sudden squeal of glee and pulled out a set of pure white linens.\\n\\n \"Oh, what a wonderful woman!\" Murie exclaimed happily. \"I shall have to write and thank her for such forethought.\" Shoulders slumping, Cecily simply shook her head and got out of the way. The men had moved over to take a look at the bed.\\n\\n \"You cannot sleep in this chamber. Is there nowhere else - \"\\n\\n \"Certainly,\" Murie said dryly. \"My husband and I could sleep together in the men\u0027s garrison this night.\"\\n\\n The comment made all four men pause and turn to gape at her.\\n\\n \"Well,\" the one who had suggested he\u0027d fix the bed said finally.\\n\\n \"You would be most welcome there, my lady.\"\\n\\n Murie turned to Cecily, arching one eyebrow.\\n\\n \"I shall fetch a broom to sweep out these rushes. We may not be able to replace them until the morrow, but at least the chamber will smell less,\" Cecily said with defeat. She hurried from the room.\\n\\n Murie set the linens back in the chest, where they were safe from getting dirty, and stood to inspect the room. Her gaze landed on the bed as the men began to raise the frame, and she hurried forward. \"Wait! I should like to remove the curtains before you put the frame back up.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll do it for you, my lady,\" one of the men said, and proceeded to rip off the curtains nearest him. The other men immediately began removing the rest of the tattered cloth, dropping it in piles on the floor. They managed the task much more quickly than she would have, Murie noted and was grateful for it. There were enough other things for her to do.\\n\\n Leaving them to their work, she bustled out of the chamber and to the stairs, encountering Cecily on her way back up, broom in hand.\\n\\n \"Do you know what they did with the furs and pillows from the wagon?\" Murie asked. Emilie had kindly left the items in the wagon for her journey from Reynard to Gaynor, claiming she\u0027d no need of the items at the moment and was happy to loan them to her for the trip home. While they would have to be sent back with the wagon driver the next day, she and Balan could at least use them this night.\\n\\n \"I believe they are still in the wagon,\" Cecily said. Nodding, Murie moved past the girl. \"I shall go find them. You start sweeping up the rushes.\"\\n\\n The great hall was empty as Murie moved through it; no doubt the servants and soldiers had all returned to those vital tasks their lord\u0027s arrival had interrupted. Murie didn\u0027t encounter anyone until she was halfway across the bailey, when two of the men came rushing up.\\n\\n \"Are you looking for your husband, my lady?\" one of the men asked. He added, \"I am Erol, my lady.\"\\n\\n \"Good eve, Erol.\" Murie flashed him a smile, then said, \"Nay. I am not looking for my husband.\"\\n\\n \"What are you looking for then, my lady?\" the other man asked. \"Mayhap we can help you. Oh, and I am Godart.\"\\n\\n \"Good eve, Godart. I am looking for the wagon my chests were on. I presume I will find it by the stables?\"\\n\\n \"Aye,\" both men said.\\n\\n \"Was there something you needed from the wagon? Mayhap we could fetch it for you,\" Erol suggested.\\n\\n \"Oh, nay,\" Murie replied. \"I would not trouble you or take you away from your work. I can manage.\"\\n\\n \" \u0027Tis no trouble,\" Godart assured her.\\n\\n \"Nay, no trouble at all,\" Erol agreed.\\n\\n Murie simply smiled and shook her head. It was obvious the men were eager to please, but she suspected this had more to do with the fact that they had few women around than anything else. As far as she knew, Gatty\u0027s two daughters were the only single females. She supposed they must be very popular with the men. They had reached the stables, and Murie bustled inside, eager to find the items she sought. Instead, she found Balan\u0027s sister seated on a stall post next to Gatty\u0027s son, Frederick, watching Habbie brush down Balan\u0027s stallion. The girl was busy chattering away to the stable master, so she did not notice Murie and the men enter. By the time Juliana realized Murie\u0027s presence and slipped off the post to make a run for it, Murie was close enough to catch her by the arm and draw her to a halt.\\n\\n \"My lady!\" Habbie said with surprise. His gaze slid from her to the squirming child she held and back before he said uncertainly,\\n\\n \"Can I help you?\"\\n\\n \"Aye.\" Murie smiled pleasantly and ignored Juliana\u0027s struggles. Her hold on the girl was firm. \"There were some furs and pillows in the wagon that rode in with us. I intended to fetch them myself, but mayhap you can show these gentlemen where they are to bring them to the lord\u0027s bedchamber for me, as I think my new sister and I have some things to discuss.\"\\n\\n \"Oh ... er ... aye. Of course, my lady,\" Habbie murmured, his concerned gaze returning to the child.\\n\\n \"Very good,\" Murie said with a smile. She turned to leave the stables, pulling Juliana with her.\\n\\n \"I ain\u0027t going with you,\" the girl snarled, trying to kick her. Unfortunately, it was difficult to kick when she was racing to stay on her feet with Murie dragging her out of the stables.\\n\\n \"Of course you are,\" Murie said. \"Surely you wish to get to know your new sister?\"\\n\\n \"Yer not my sister,\" the girl snapped.\\n\\n \"I am married to your brother, Juliana. That makes me your sister.\"\\n\\n \"My lady, we have the things you asked for,\" Godart said, gasping as he hurried to her side.\\n\\n Murie glanced around to see all three men now trailing her and all three out of breath. It seemed obvious that they had rushed to gather the things she\u0027d asked for and hurried after her, concerned for the child. She supposed she could not blame them; they did not know her and so could not be sure she would not beat the child or perform some other equally fearsome punishment as retribution for the earlier kick. They would learn in time.\\n\\n \"Thank you,\" she said, not slowing her step. She had no desire to be kicked again.\\n\\n \"Would you like one of us to take Juliana to your husband for you?\" Erol panted.\\n\\n \"Certainly not. You were there, surely you heard my husband say that I may handle the matter myself?\"\\n\\n \"Aye,\" Habbie agreed. \"But - \"\\n\\n \"But nothing, sir,\" Murie said firmly and gave him a reassuring smile. She could handle this. She wasn\u0027t sure how, but she would handle it.\\n\\n They had reached the keep by then, and Murie mounted the stairs as quickly as she\u0027d crossed the bailey: not so fast that the girl could not keep up, but quickly enough that her attention was distracted by the effort. The men followed across the great hall and above stairs and finally into the bedchamber. They arrived just as the four men who had been fixing Murie\u0027s bed trooped out with the ragged remains of the curtains.\\n\\n Murmuring her thanks for their help, Murie slipped past and into the room, drawing Juliana with her.\\n\\n Murie did not pause inside, but now walked around dragging Juliana with her. She was afraid that, should she stop, the child would strike out at her again; and if her husband heard about it, he would surely take over the matter himself. It was not that Murie feared Balan would beat his sister, though she suspected he might take her over his knee. But she didn\u0027t wish to see the child punished at all. Murie found herself feeling great empathy for the girl, and all she really wanted to do was hug her and assure her she was loved and cared for and everything would be all right. But she first needed to get past the hard, defensive outer layer the child wore like armor.\\n\\n She pondered the matter as she glanced over the repaired bed. It looked much better without the tattered cloth hanging around it and with the nasty old linens removed. It looked as if the men had beaten the dust out, too. Relieved, Murie turned her attention to how much progress Cecily had made with the rushes. The woman had cleared away one corner of the smelly floor covering and was still working industriously.\\n\\n Noting the weariness Juliana was beginning to display, Murie slowed her steps and turned to the men. \"Very well, gentlemen, thank you so much for helping me gather these things. If you would be kind enough to set them on the chests over there, Juliana and I can start making the bed.\"\\n\\n The girl\u0027s steps had begun to falter, but this comment seemed to perk her up. She snarled, \"I\u0027ll not.\"\\n\\n \"You will,\" Murie assured her calmly, circling the room once more.\\n\\n \"You cannot make me.\" The girl tried to tug free once more, but Murie had a firm hold on her arm.\\n\\n \"Godart?\" Murie said as she started around the room for the third time. \"Am I right in assuming that you are one of Balan\u0027s soldiers?\"\\n\\n \"Aye,\" the man answered. Then he added, \"We take turns manning the walls and guarding the castle, or doing the labor that needs doing around here. This week is my week for labor.\"\\n\\n \"I fear today is your day to be a guard,\" Murie countered.\\n\\n \"Please stand by the door and ensure Juliana does not leave. She will not exit this room until I say so, and I will not say so until she has done what I have asked of her.\"\\n\\n The man nodded, and Murie released Juliana. The child hesitated the briefest moment, probably torn between kicking her again and fleeing. In the end, she chose fleeing and made a rush for the door, but Go-dart was immediately in front of it, between her and freedom. Juliana didn\u0027t slow; she charged him in a bull-like fashion, crashing into his legs and proceeding to kick and strike out at him with her small fists.\\n\\n Murie winced and sent him an apologetic glance, but the man just smiled and shook his head. He wore boots and leather leggings, and apparently this was enough to protect him, for he truly did not seem to be suffering any pain. He simply stood there, immovable, allowing the girl to wear herself out. Having just jogged across the bailey up the stairs and around the room several times, it did not take the child long to give up. Apparently, seeing how ineffective her attack was, she then tried to squeeze her way around him to reach the door handle. Godart let her, but was leaning against the door so it did her little good. After tugging uselessly for several minutes, she turned to glare around the room.\\n\\n \"Your brother said that I may handle the matter of your kicking me in greeting,\" Murie said, drawing the girl\u0027s gaze. \"I would prefer to be friends with you and even proper sisters. However, if he does not feel I handled it effectively, he shall surely punish you himself and no doubt much more harshly than I would, and then you would no doubt blame me and never be willing to be friends with me.\\n\\n \"I am sure he will think helping Cecily and I clean this room is punishment enough,\" she added quietly. \"And that way, perhaps we could talk, and you could get to know me better and decide if you might wish to be friends.\"\\n\\n The girl hesitated, scowling. \"I do not want to be friends. And once you get to know me, you will not wish to be friends either.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, that is where you are wrong,\" Murie assured her, moving to collect the linens from where she\u0027d set them earlier. \"I already quite like you.\" A glance to the side showed the girl looking uncertain.\\n\\n \"Why?\"Juliana asked suspiciously.\\n\\n \"Because you remind me of myself at your age.\" This comment made the girl\u0027s eyes widen in complete and utter disbelief.\\n\\n Before any doubt could be voiced, Murie announced, \"I too was orphaned at the age often.\"\\n\\n That made the girl pause, so Murie continued: \"My mother fell ill with the red plague.\"\\n\\n \"The smallpox?\" Juliana asked uncertainly.\\n\\n \"Aye.\" Murie carried the linens to the bed. \"The servants were afraid of contracting it and neglected her terribly. When my father found out, he took over her care; trying to get her to eat, cleaning her sores and bathing her to try to bring down her fevers. He stayed with her night and day, neither eating nor sleeping himself so that, by the time she died, he was sick as well and too weak and exhausted to fight the illness himself. He went very quickly.\"\\n\\n \"My father nursed my mother as well,\" Juliana said quietly, automatically taking the end of the linen Murie handed her. \"She had childbed fever, though, and I do not think men get that.\"\\n\\n \"Nay,\" Murie agreed.\\n\\n \"But you went to court,\" Juliana pointed out, her eyes narrowing. \"And the king is said to have spoiled you.\"\\n\\n \"Aye, I was sent to court to live with my godfather the king. And aye, \u0027tis said that he spoiled me. However, the truth is, the king was always terribly busy and had very little time for me,\" Murie assured her. It was true. While the king had spoiled her and his own children when at court, until the plague hit, Edward had very rarely been there. Usually he\u0027d been mounting some campaign or other in Scotland or France. Murie could count on the fingers of one hand how many times she\u0027d seen him during her first five years at court.\\n\\n \"What of the queen?\" Habbie asked, reminding Murie that the men were still present. She didn\u0027t mind, however; the stable master had asked the question, but his gaze was on Juliana, trying to gauge how she was reacting to the news.\\n\\n \"The queen was very busy too,\" Murie said quietly. \"And then, she already had children of her own to tend, and between that and state business she had little enough time for another child. I was pretty much on my own at court except for my friend Emilie.\"\\n\\n Murie commented when Juliana remained silent, \"Gatty seems very nice.\"\\n\\n \"Aye... but she has her own children, too, and everyone here is always busy. Frederick is my friend,\" Juliana added quietly, as Murie folded the edge of bed linen under the straw-stuffed mattress and then imitating the action herself.\\n\\n \"And what do you and Frederick do to have fun?\" Murie asked, moving to the foot of the bed to tuck in a corner. The girl began to talk, and Murie glanced toward the men and nodded silently. After a hesitation, they nodded back and reluctantly left the room. A glance toward Cecily showed she\u0027d paused and leaned against her broom to watch and listen as well, but now she shook her head and returned to sweeping up the rushes.\\n\\n Murie turned her attention back to her new sister, smiling faintly as the child revealed some of the pranks she and Frederick had got up to. It seemed obvious the girl was intelligent and really very tenderhearted under all the anger bubbling on the surface, and she could have wept for Juliana; but she didn\u0027t. Instead, she vowed to ensure Juliana felt loved and valued as she\u0027d never felt herself since the death of her parents.\\n\\n \"I hope Murie had Cook make something for us to eat. I am famished,\" Osgoode said as he and Balan mounted the steps to the keep.\\n\\n \"I am sure she did. She must be hungry as well,\" Balan answered, running a hand through his hair. He too was hungry. He was also a tad weary. The week of worry at Reynard had taken its toll. Balan had spent many sleepless nights watching over his new wife as she struggled, her feverish body fighting to rid itself of poison. He\u0027d tried to comfort her when she wept for her parents, to soothe her when she cried out and fled from demons in her dreams, and had even had entire conversations with her about things she liked or disliked, though she didn\u0027t appear to remember any of it when she woke up.\\n\\n During that time, Balan had learned that his wife was as tenderhearted as he\u0027d suspected, was more intelligent than he\u0027d realized and that she\u0027d somehow managed to make a huge space for herself in his heart. He\u0027d believed they might deal well together, else he would never have married her, but now he found himself wishing for more than \"dealing well.\" He wanted her to love him. Balan did not necessarily want to love her in return, for that was a messy female emotion and a sticky web in which he would rather not find himself caught. But he did wish for her to love him. He simply didn\u0027t know how to achieve that.\\n\\n \"If she has,\" Osgoode said dryly, distracting him from his thoughts, \"I bet it is something with fish in it.\" Balan gave a harsh laugh, knowing there was little question. Anselm had already told them the men had not managed any hunting at all while he was gone. Not that he\u0027d expected it. The great hall was quiet and empty when they entered. Balan remembered a day when just the opposite would have been the case, when the walls seemed to ring with chatter and laughter as people bustled in and out about their business. However, the plague had changed all that. He sincerely hoped to see the day when it was happy again, and with Murie\u0027s help hoped that day was not too far off.\\n\\n The two cousins headed for the door leading to the kitchens in the hopes of finding food, but paused when the door opened and Clement stuck his head out.\\n\\n \"Oh. You\u0027re back,\" he said as he spotted them. \"Good. I\u0027ve roasted some fish over the fire as your wife said you\u0027d both be hungry.\"\\n\\n \"Where is my wife?\" Balan asked, then frowned when the man disappeared back into the kitchen. He took another step toward the door, but paused when it opened again and Clement stepped out with three trenchers stacked on top of each other, each full offish.\\n\\n \"Her ladyship is up preparing your bedchamber for the night,\" Clement answered, shoving the trenchers at them. \"You might want to let her know the food\u0027s ready before it gets cold. I\u0027ve to clean the kitchen.\"\\n\\n The moment Balan took the trenchers, Clement turned and marched away.\\n\\n \"He grows surlier with each passing day,\" Osgoode said, taking one of the trenchers.\\n\\n Balan shrugged. \"He is doing the best he can with little in the way of supplies, and everyone is groaning at the results.\"\\n\\n \"Aye.\" Osgoode wrinkled his nose at the fish on his trencher and turned to move toward the trestle tables. He paused to ask,\\n\\n \"Are you taking that up to Murie?\"\\n\\n \"Aye. Did you wish to join us?\"\\n\\n Osgoode grinned. \"I would not be so cruel. Enjoy your wife - I mean enjoy your meal with your wife,\" corrected, eyes twinkling. Chuckling, Balan turned and made his way to the stairs with the two trenchers. His parents\u0027 private chambers had been above stairs ever since they added the second floor to the keep some twenty-five years ago. Balan had been too young to really remember what it had been like before, and had not taken over the master bedchamber upon returning to find his father dead and Gaynor in chaos. He\u0027d taken one look at the ruined room and decided to make his way to the garrison to bunk with the men who had gone off to battle with him.\\n\\n He couldn\u0027t imagine that his wife would be able to make the room inhabitable in such a short time, but he was pleasantly surprised upon reaching the open door. The filthy rushes that had coated the bedroom floor had been removed and the floor swept clean, furs thrown down beside the bed and in front of the fire to make it more comfortable, presumably until fresh rushes could be gathered and strewn. Furs had also been hung over the rickety shutters at the windows. The smelly, molding, rotted curtains had been removed from the bed and fresh linens and furs now covered that as well.\\n\\n A fire had been set in the fireplace. It wasn\u0027t really needed at this time of year, but something sweet had been added to the wood to fill the room with a much more attractive scent than the overpowering and unpleasant stench Balan recalled from the last time he\u0027d entered.\\n\\n His gaze slid over the hard work done and to the two females in the room. Murie and Juliana. The little girl stood in front of the fireplace wearing a pale yellow gown that was a little big on her.\\n\\n \"Osgoode thought you were about the size of Lady Greyville\u0027s daughter, and so we used her for sizing,\" Murie was explaining as she finished the fastenings of the gown. \"\u0027Tis obvious the girl is a bit bigger than you, but you shall grow into it quickly, and we can put temporary stitches in until you do.\"\\n\\n Juliana was silent, her eyes wide as she touched the frock.\\n\\n \"And mayhap we can do something about your hair tomorrow,\" Murie suggested gently.\\n\\n \"I cut it myself,\" Julianna admitted, putting a self-conscious hand to her head.\\n\\n \"And you did a fine job,\" Murie assured her quickly. \"But \u0027tis difficult to cut your own hair, and there are a couple of places where it could use evening out.\"\\n\\n Juliana nodded and confessed, \"I thought if I looked more like a boy, my father might like me better.\"\\n\\n Balan felt his heart squeeze at these pain-filled words and silently cursed his father for neglecting his sister. In his pain, the man had cared little about the suffering he was causing his child. Balan had tried to reason with him, but - obstinate as ever - he\u0027d just waved the words away and refused to discuss Juliana.\\n\\n \"Oh,\" Murie breathed, and Balan could feel her empathy for the child. She bowed her head and was silent a moment, then straightened and took the girl by the shoulders. Solemnly she said, \"I am sure he liked you fine in his deepest heart, Juliana, but men have trouble expressing themselves sometimes.\"\\n\\n \"Nuh-uh.\" The child shook her head. \"He showed anger well enough.\"\\n\\n \"Aye, well, that seems easy enough for all of them to show,\" Murie agreed dryly. She added, \" \u0027Tis the finer emotions they have trouble with.\"\\n\\n \"He hated me because I killed Momma,\" Juliana said, her eyes suddenly afraid. It seemed obvious to Balan she feared Murie would no longer like her once she knew this fact, or what the girl thought was fact, and he found himself squeezing his fingers around the trencher hard enough to crush the crusty, hollowed-out bread.\\n\\n \"You did not kill your mother, Juliana,\" Murie said in a firm voice. \"She fell ill with a fever after giving birth to you. That was not your fault. It happens sometimes, and no one can say why - else we could stop it. It could happen to me, and it would not be my child\u0027s fault,\" she added, and Balan felt his eyes widen at the horrible suggestion. But she continued: \"And I hope you would love and comfort my child for me in my stead, did that happen, not blame it for something it was not responsible for.\"\\n\\n \"Aye,\" Juliana promised solemnly.\\n\\n \"Good.\" Murie smiled at the girl and stepped back. \"I think you look lovely in the dress. Howbeit, mayhap you should remove it until we can take it in and take up the hem. I would not see you trip and come to harm on the stairs.\"\\n\\n Nodding, Juliana allowed her to undo and lift the gown clear.\\n\\n \"Will I still be able to play with Frederick in the dress?\" the child asked worriedly as she put on her leggings and cotehardie.\\n\\n \"Well...\" Murie paused and frowned, then suggested, \"You could if you were to keep wearing your cotehardie during the day and then changed into the dress for sup.\"\\n\\n \"Oh!\" Juliana grinned. \"It would be like being a boy like Frederick during the day and a girl like you at night!\" Murie laughed as she carefully folded the gown. \"Aye, that it would.\"\\n\\n Once dressed, Juliana said, \"Thank you, Murie. \u0027Tis a beautiful dress. I have never owned anything so lovely.\"\\n\\n Murie smiled and shrugged. \"I thought it would be nice to bring my new sister a gift, to show I am glad to be a member of your family.\"\\n\\n \"We are sisters, are we not?\" the girl said happily. \"I think I shall like having you for a sister. I am glad Balan married you.\" Juliana hugged her quickly and then turned to flee, pausing with a start when she spotted her brother.\\n\\n \"Good eve, Balan. Murie is nice,\" she announced as she skirted him for the door. \"I have to go tell Gatty about my dress.\" Balan watched his sister go running down the hall with a light step he\u0027d not seen since his return from France. Once she\u0027d disappeared down the stairs, he shifted the trenchers to one hand, closed the door with the other and turned to face his wife. Much to his amazement, she was watching him almost warily. He understood why when she spoke.\\n\\n \"I did punish her. She helped me make the bed and hang the furs and find herbs for the fire,\" she said quickly. \"The dress was a reward for her hard work.\"\\n\\n Balan smiled faintly and, moving forward, pointed out: \"You commissioned the gown ere you ever met her or knew there would be something to reward.\"\\n\\n \"Aye, well, I thought she might like it.\"\\n\\n Balan paused before his wife and started to reach for her, only to come to a halt when he recalled the trenchers in his hands. He peered at the roast fish with a frown and then glanced at Murie.\\n\\n \"I brought you food.\"\\n\\n \"I am not hungry right this moment, I - \" Her words ended on a gasp of surprise as he suddenly dropped the trenchers on the fur next to them and caught her in his arms, his mouth covering hers, hard and demanding.\\n\\n Her kindness to his sister had touched him, and as he\u0027d watched he could imagine her with their own children: teaching them, comforting them, mothering them. It had made his heart ache with a sort of yearning that he did not understand but that he wanted to express. He wanted to devour her; he wanted to hold her so tight that she became a part of him he was never without.\\n\\n Saying so would probably alarm the woman, however, so he expressed himself the only way he knew how. Mouth covering and filling hers, he ran his hands up and down her body, pressing as close as he could get while they were dressed. Of course it wasn\u0027t enough, and he soon swept her into his arms and carried her to the bed. Unwilling to be parted from her for even a moment, he let her feet drop so that she hung in his arms and then tumbled them both onto the bed, his mouth breaking away on a shout of surprise. The bed had collapsed beneath them!\\n\\n Eyes wide, he peered around at the buckled frame and then down at his wife in surprise. She shook beneath him with silent laughter.\\n\\n Sobering as his eyes met hers, she murmured, \"I think we may need a new bed, my lord husband.\"\\n\\n \"Aye,\" he agreed on a husky growl. Then he kissed her again, his hands beginning to remove her gown. They could worry about a new bed on the morrow. He had other matters to attend tonight. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-brat/page-12.html","bookId":2653,"book":{"id":2653,"title":"The Brat","description":"Storyline: Who would marryall the knights had heard tales of Lady Murie, King Edward III\u0027s goddaughter and much feted favorite.
