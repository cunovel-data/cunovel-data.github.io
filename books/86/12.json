If a man can for one day subduehimself and return to propriety, an under heaven will ascribe perfectvirtue to him. Is the practice of perfect virtue from a man himself, or isit from others?\"Yen Yuan said, \"I beg to ask the steps of that process.\" The Masterreplied, \"Look not at what is contrary to propriety; listen not to what iscontrary to propriety; speak not what is contrary to propriety; make nomovement which is contrary to propriety.\" Yen Yuan then said, \"Though I amdeficient in intelligence and vigor, I will make it my business to practicethis lesson.\"Chung-kung asked about perfect virtue. The Master said, \"It is, when you goabroad, to behave to every one as if you were receiving a great guest; toemploy the people as if you were assisting at a great sacrifice; not to doto others as you would not wish done to yourself; to have no murmuringagainst you in the country, and none in the family.\" Chung-kung said,\"Though I am deficient in intelligence and vigor, I will make it mybusiness to practice this lesson.\"Sze-ma Niu asked about perfect virtue.\n 　　The Master said, \"The man of perfect virtue is cautious and slow in hisspeech.\"\"Cautious and slow in his speech!\" said Niu;-\"is this what is meant byperfect virtue?\" The Master said, \"When a man feels the difficulty ofdoing, can he be other than cautious and slow in speaking?\"Sze-ma Niu asked about the superior man. The Master said, \"The superior manhas neither anxiety nor fear.\"\"Being without anxiety or fear!\" said Nui;\"does this constitute what wecall the superior man?\"The Master said, \"When internal examination discovers nothing wrong, whatis there to be anxious about, what is there to fear?\"Sze-ma Niu, full of anxiety, said, \"Other men all have their brothers, Ionly have not.\"Tsze-hsia said to him, \"There is the following saying which I haveheard-\u0027Death and life have their determined appointment; riches and honorsdepend upon Heaven.\u0027\n 　　\"Let the superior man never fail reverentially to order his own conduct,and let him be respectful to others and observant of propriety:-then allwithin the four seas will be his brothers. What has the superior man to dowith being distressed because he has no brothers?\"Tsze-chang asked what constituted intelligence. The Master said, \"He withwhom neither slander that gradually soaks into the mind, nor statementsthat startle like a wound in the flesh, are successful may be calledintelligent indeed. Yea, he with whom neither soaking slander, norstartling statements, are successful, may be called farseeing.\"Tsze-kung asked about government. The Master said, \"The requisites ofgovernment are that there be sufficiency of food, sufficiency of militaryequipment, and the confidence of the people in their ruler.\"Tsze-kung said, \"If it cannot be helped, and one of these must be dispensedwith, which of the three should be foregone first?\" \"The militaryequipment,\" said the Master.\n 　　Tsze-kung again asked, \"If it cannot be helped, and one of the remainingtwo must be dispensed with, which of them should be foregone?\" The Masteranswered, \"Part with the food. From of old, death has been the lot of anmen; but if the people have no faith in their rulers, there is no standingfor the state.\"Chi Tsze-ch\u0027ang said, \"In a superior man it is only the substantialqualities which are wanted;-why should we seek for ornamentalaccomplishments?\"Tsze-kung said, \"Alas! Your words, sir, show you to be a superior man, butfour horses cannot overtake the tongue. Ornament is as substance; substanceis as ornament. The hide of a tiger or a leopard stripped of its hair, islike the hide of a dog or a goat stripped of its hair.\"The Duke Ai inquired of Yu Zo, saying, \"The year is one of scarcity, andthe returns for expenditure are not sufficient;-what is to be done?\"Yu Zo replied to him, \"Why not simply tithe the people?\"\"With two tenths, said the duke, \"I find it not enough;-how could I do withthat system of one tenth?\"Yu Zo answered, \"If the people have plenty, their prince will not be leftto want alone. If the people are in want, their prince cannot enjoy plentyalone.\"Tsze-chang having asked how virtue was to be exalted, and delusions to bediscovered, the Master said, \"Hold faithfulness and sincerity as firstprinciples, and be moving continually to what is right,-this is the way toexalt one\u0027s virtue.\n 　　\"You love a man and wish him to live; you hate him and wish him to die.\n 　　Having wished him to live, you also wish him to die. This is a case ofdelusion. \u0027It may not be on account of her being rich, yet you come to makea difference.\u0027\"The Duke Ching, of Ch\u0027i, asked Confucius about government. Confuciusreplied, \"There is government, when the prince is prince, and the ministeris minister; when the father is father, and the son is son.\"\"Good!\" said the duke; \"if, indeed, the prince be not prince, the notminister, the father not father, and the son not son, although I have myrevenue, can I enjoy it?\"The Master said, \"Ah! it is Yu, who could with half a word settlelitigations!\"Tsze-lu never slept over a promise.\n 　　The Master said, \"In hearing litigations, I am like any other body. What isnecessary, however, is to cause the people to have no litigations.\"Tsze-chang asked about government. The Master said, \"The art of governingis to keep its affairs before the mind without weariness, and to practicethem with undeviating consistency.\"The Master said, \"By extensively studying all learning, and keeping himselfunder the restraint of the rules of propriety, one may thus likewise noterr from what is right.\"The Master said, \"The superior man seeks to perfect the admirable qualitiesof men, and does not seek to perfect their bad qualities. The mean man doesthe opposite of this.\"Chi K\u0027ang asked Confucius about government. Confucius replied, \"To governmeans to rectify. If you lead on the people with correctness, who will darenot to be correct?\"Chi K\u0027ang, distressed about the number of thieves in the state, inquired ofConfucius how to do away with them. Confucius said, \"If you, sir, were notcovetous, although you should reward them to do it, they would not steal.\"Chi K\u0027ang asked Confucius about government, saying, \"What do you say tokilling the unprincipled for the good of the principled?\" Confuciusreplied, \"Sir, in carrying on your government, why should you use killingat all? Let your evinced desires be for what is good, and the people willbe good. The relation between superiors and inferiors is like that betweenthe wind and the grass. The grass must bend, when the wind blows acrossit.\"Tsze-chang asked, \"What must the officer be, who may be said to bedistinguished?\"The Master said, \"What is it you call being distinguished?\"Tsze-chang replied, \"It is to be heard of through the state, to be heard ofthroughout his clan.\"The Master said, \"That is notoriety, not distinction.\n 　　\"Now the man of distinction is solid and straightforward, and lovesrighteousness. He examines people\u0027s words, and looks at their countenances.\n 　　He is anxious to humble himself to others. Such a man will be distinguishedin the country; he will be distinguished in his clan.\n 　　\"As to the man of notoriety, he assumes the appearance of virtue, but hisactions are opposed to it, and he rests in this character without anydoubts about himself. Such a man will be heard of in the country; he willbe heard of in the clan.\"Fan Ch\u0027ih rambling with the Master under the trees about the rain altars,said, \"I venture to ask how to exalt virtue, to correct cherished evil, andto discover delusions.\"The Master said, \"Truly a good question!\n 　　\"If doing what is to be done be made the first business, and success asecondary consideration:-is not this the way to exalt virtue? To assailone\u0027s own wickedness and not assail that of others;-is not this the way tocorrect cherished evil? For a morning\u0027s anger to disregard one\u0027s own life,and involve that of his parents;-is not this a case of delusion?\"Fan Ch\u0027ih asked about benevolence. The Master said, \"It is to love allmen.\" He asked about knowledge. The Master said, \"It is to know all men.\"Fan Ch\u0027ih did not immediately understand these answers.\n 　　The Master said, \"Employ the upright and put aside all the crooked; in thisway the crooked can be made to be upright.\"Fan Ch\u0027ih retired, and, seeing Tsze-hsia, he said to him, \"A Little whileago, I had an interview with our Master, and asked him about knowledge. Hesaid, \u0027Employ the upright, and put aside all the crooked;-in this way, thecrooked will be made to be upright.\u0027 What did he mean?\"Tsze-hsia said, \"Truly rich is his saying!\n 　　\"Shun, being in possession of the kingdom, selected from among all thepeople, and employed Kai-yao-on which all who were devoid of virtuedisappeared. T\u0027ang, being in possession of the kingdom, selected from amongall the people, and employed I Yin-and an who were devoid of virtuedisappeared.\"Tsze-kung asked about friendship. The Master said, \"Faithfully admonishyour friend, and skillfully lead him on. If you find him impracticable,stop. Do not disgrace yourself.\"The philosopher Tsang said, \"The superior man on grounds of culture meetswith his friends, and by friendship helps his virtue.\"\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/645/3630.html","bookId":86,"book":{"id":86,"title":"论语 The Analects","description":"简介： 《论语》是记载中国古代著名思想家孔子及其弟子言行的语录，共四十卷，由孔子的弟子及其再传弟子编写，是我国古代儒家经典著作之一，是首创语录体。汉语文章的典范性也源于此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/120911/1-120911140242958.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/645","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:14 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:14 AM"}}
