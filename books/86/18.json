Pi-kan remonstrated with him and died.\\n\\n 　　Confucius said, \"The Yin dynasty possessed these three men of virtue.\"Hui of Liu-hsia, being chief criminal judge, was thrice dismissed from hisoffice. Some one said to him, \"Is it not yet time for you, sir, to leavethis?\" He replied, \"Serving men in an upright way, where shall I go to, andnot experience such a thrice-repeated dismissal? If I choose to serve menin a crooked way, what necessity is there for me to leave the country of myparents?\"The duke Ching of Ch\u0027i, with reference to the manner in which he shouldtreat Confucius, said, \"I cannot treat him as I would the chief of the Chifamily. I will treat him in a manner between that accorded to the chief ofthe Chil and that given to the chief of the Mang family.\" He also said, \"Iam old; I cannot use his doctrines.\" Confucius took his departure.\\n\\n 　　The people of Ch\u0027i sent to Lu a present of female musicians, which Chi Hwanreceived, and for three days no court was held. Confucius took hisdeparture.\\n\\n 　　The madman of Ch\u0027u, Chieh-yu, passed by Confucius, singing and saying, \"OFANG! O FANG! How is your virtue degenerated! As to the past, reproof isuseless; but the future may still be provided against. Give up your vainpursuit. Give up your vain pursuit. Peril awaits those who now engage inaffairs of government.\"Confucius alighted and wished to converse with him, but Chieh-yu hastenedaway, so that he could not talk with him.\\n\\n 　　Ch\u0027ang-tsu and Chieh-ni were at work in the field together, when Confuciuspassed by them, and sent Tsze-lu to inquire for the ford.\\n\\n 　　Ch\u0027ang-tsu said, \"Who is he that holds the reins in the carriage there?\"Tsze-lu told him, \"It is K\u0027ung Ch\u0027iu.\u0027, \"Is it not K\u0027ung of Lu?\" asked he.\\n\\n 　　\"Yes,\" was the reply, to which the other rejoined, \"He knows the ford.\"Tsze-lu then inquired of Chieh-ni, who said to him, \"Who are you, sir?\" Heanswered, \"I am Chung Yu.\" \"Are you not the disciple of K\u0027ung Ch\u0027iu of Lu?\"asked the other. \"I am,\" replied he, and then Chieh-ni said to him,\"Disorder, like a swelling flood, spreads over the whole empire, and who ishe that will change its state for you? Rather than follow one who merelywithdraws from this one and that one, had you not better follow those whohave withdrawn from the world altogether?\" With this he fell to covering upthe seed, and proceeded with his work, without stopping.\\n\\n 　　Tsze-lu went and reported their remarks, when the Master observed with asigh, \"It is impossible to associate with birds and beasts, as if they werethe same with us. If I associate not with these people,-with mankind,-withwhom shall I associate? If right principles prevailed through the empire,there would be no use for me to change its state.\"Tsze-lu, following the Master, happened to fall behind, when he met an oldman, carrying across his shoulder on a staff a basket for weeds. Tsze-lusaid to him, \"Have you seen my master, sir?\" The old man replied, \"Yourfour limbs are unaccustomed to toil; you cannot distinguish the five kindsof grain:-who is your master?\" With this, he planted his staff in theground, and proceeded to weed.\\n\\n 　　Tsze-lu joined his hands across his breast, and stood before him.\\n\\n 　　The old man kept Tsze-lu to pass the night in his house, killed a fowl,prepared millet, and feasted him. He also introduced to him his two sons.\\n\\n 　　Next day, Tsze-lu went on his way, and reported his adventure. The Mastersaid, \"He is a recluse,\" and sent Tsze-lu back to see him again, but whenhe got to the place, the old man was gone.\\n\\n 　　Tsze-lu then said to the family, \"Not to take office is not righteous. Ifthe relations between old and young may not be neglected, how is it that hesets aside the duties that should be observed between sovereign andminister? Wishing to maintain his personal purity, he allows that greatrelation to come to confusion. A superior man takes office, and performsthe righteous duties belonging to it. As to the failure of right principlesto make progress, he is aware of that.\"The men who have retired to privacy from the world have been Po-i,Shu-ch\u0027i, Yuchung, I-yi, Chu-chang, Hui of Liu-hsia, and Shao-lien.\\n\\n 　　The Master said, \"Refusing to surrender their wills, or to submit to anytaint in their persons; such, I think, were Po-i and Shu-ch\u0027i.\\n\\n 　　\"It may be said of Hui of Liu-hsia! and of Shaolien, that they surrenderedtheir wills, and submitted to taint in their persons, but their wordscorresponded with reason, and their actions were such as men are anxious tosee. This is all that is to be remarked in them.\\n\\n 　　\"It may be said of Yu-chung and I-yi, that, while they hid themselves intheir seclusion, they gave a license to their words; but in their persons,they succeeded in preserving their purity, and, in their retirement, theyacted according to the exigency of the times.\\n\\n 　　\"I am different from all these. I have no course for which I ampredetermined, and no course against which I am predetermined.\"The grand music master, Chih, went to Ch\u0027i.\\n\\n 　　Kan, the master of the band at the second meal, went to Ch\u0027u.

He does not cause the greatministers to repine at his not employing them. Without some great cause, hedoes not dismiss from their offices the members of old families. He doesnot seek in one man talents for every employment.\"To Chau belonged the eight officers, Po-ta, Po-kwo, Chung-tu, Chung-hwu,Shu-ya, Shuhsia, Chi-sui, and Chi-kwa.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/645/3636.html","bookId":86,"book":{"id":86,"title":"论语 The Analects","description":"简介： 《论语》是记载中国古代著名思想家孔子及其弟子言行的语录，共四十卷，由孔子的弟子及其再传弟子编写，是我国古代儒家经典著作之一，是首创语录体。汉语文章的典范性也源于此...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/120911/1-120911140242958.jpg","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/645","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:14 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:14 AM"}}
