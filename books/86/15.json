If his words be not sincere and truthful and hisactions not honorable and carefull will he, with such conduct, beappreciated, even in his neighborhood?\\n\\n 　　\"When he is standing, let him see those two things, as it were, frontinghim. When he is in a carriage, let him see them attached to the yoke. Thenmay he subsequently carry them into practice.\"Tsze-chang wrote these counsels on the end of his sash.\\n\\n 　　The Master said, \"Truly straightforward was the historiographer Yu. Whengood government prevailed in his state, he was like an arrow. When badgovernment prevailed, he was like an arrow. A superior man indeed is ChuPo-yu! When good government prevails in his state, he is to be found inoffice. When bad government prevails, he can roll his principles up, andkeep them in his breast.\"The Master said, \"When a man may be spoken with, not to speak to him is toerr in reference to the man. When a man may not be spoken with, to speak tohim is to err in reference to our words. The wise err neither in regard totheir man nor to their words.\"The Master said, \"The determined scholar and the man of virtue will notseek to live at the expense of injuring their virtue.

I have not seen one who loves virtue ashe loves beauty.\"The Master said, \"Was not Tsang Wan like one who had stolen his situation?\\n\\n 　　He knew the virtue and the talents of Hui of Liu-hsia, and yet did notprocure that he should stand with him in court.\"The Master said, \"He who requires much from himself and little from others,will keep himself from being the object of resentment.\"The Master said, \"When a man is not in the habit of saying-\u0027What shall Ithink of this? What shall I think of this?\u0027 I can indeed do nothing withhim!\"The Master said, \"When a number of people are together, for a whole day,without their conversation turning on righteousness, and when they are fondof carrying out the suggestions of a small shrewdness;-theirs is indeed ahard case.\"The Master said, \"The superior man in everything considers righteousness tobe essential. He performs it according to the rules of propriety. He bringsit forth in humility. He completes it with sincerity.

What you do not want done to yourself, do not do to others.\"The Master said, \"In my dealings with men, whose evil do I blame, whosegoodness do I praise, beyond what is proper? If I do sometimes exceed inpraise, there must be ground for it in my examination of the individual.\\n\\n 　　\"This people supplied the ground why the three dynasties pursued the pathof straightforwardness.\"The Master said, \"Even in my early days, a historiographer would leave ablank in his text, and he who had a horse would lend him to another toride. Now, alas! there are no such things.\"The Master said, \"Specious words confound virtue. Want of forbearance insmall matters confounds great plans.\"The Master said, \"When the multitude hate a man, it is necessary to examineinto the case. When the multitude like a man, it is necessary to examineinto the case.\"The Master said, \"A man can enlarge the principles which he follows; thoseprinciples do not enlarge the man.\"The Master said, \"To have faults and not to reform them,-this, indeed,should be pronounced having faults.\"The Master said, \"I have been the whole day without eating, and the wholenight without sleeping:-occupied with thinking. It was of no use. betterplan is to learn.\"The Master said, \"The object of the superior man is truth. Food is not hisobject. There is plowing;-even in that there is sometimes want. So withlearning;-emolument may be found in it.
