She gently caressed Erzsébet’s cheek. “You are loved, my darling.”\\n\\n Erzsébet grasped Cneajna’s hand tightly and kissed it softly over and over again, then whispered, “I knew you would come. You who have always loved me best.”\\n\\n Cneajna smiled softly. “You were not forgotten. You are one of us. We cannot endure you to suffer.” Cneajna kissed Erzsébet’s soft cheek, then covered her mouth with her own to feed her.\\n\\n The other two Brides stood at their side, watching solemnly. I could not help but notice that they did not look at the iron stake, but only at Erzsébet’s lovely face. This fate was too horrible to dwell upon for long.\\n\\n Cneajna finished and stood back. Her gaze turned to me. “You do not have to give if it is not your desire.”\\n\\n I hesitated, then stepped forward. “I want to know her.”\\n\\n As I drew near, I could see the ugly wound that surrounded the iron stake impaling Erzsébet. The pain she endures must be unbearable. With trembling fingers, I reached out and grabbed hold of the iron stake. With all my strength I attempted to pull it upwards and out of her, but it did not move.\\n\\n “We have all tried,” Elina said. “All of us. Together. It does not move.”\\n\\n Erzsébet reached out and her cold hand closed over mine. Gently, her long fingers stroked mine. Our matching ruby rings glittered in the torchlight. She drew my hand to her lips and kissed it. Her eyes were golden and burned with a strange fever as her red lips spread into a sorrowful smile.\\n\\n “There is no hope for me, my sister. I am trapped here forever. Neither alive nor dead. This is my fate.”\\n\\n “It is too cruel! To cruel a fate!” I gripped her hand tightly in mine and pressed it to my bosom. I was overcome by the woman’s serene beauty. The languid tones of her speech were soothing to my ear and I felt drawn to this imprisoned woman. She was magnificently beautiful with her rounded cheeks and delicate mouth. With a pang of sadness I realized that the vampire reminded me of my own mortal mother.\\n\\n The Countess Dolingen reached up her hands to touch my face with a mother’s tenderness as I wept. Drawing me down, she whispered to me in urgent tones. “When he brought you to me, I looked upon your face and I saw my own strong will, my own pride, my own strength. You will escape him. I know this as assuredly as I know I shall die in this tomb. I know it. I have seen it in my dreams. He will not be able to hold you.”\\n\\n Tears fell freely from my eyes as I pressed her hands against my face. “I shall. I shall escape him.”\\n\\n Erzsébet smiled then reached her hands out to her other vampire sisters. They gathered around her, their love for her a soothing balm to her torment. As we gathered near her and touched her reverently, I realized I had fully become a true sister in this strange family of vampire women.\\n\\n Then the serenity of the tomb was broken. I felt an incredible pain rip through my abdomen. Gasping, I fell to my knees. It felt as if I was being torn apart.\\n\\n Elina helped me back to my feet and steadied me. “It is the beckoning. He is pulling you back! If you do not go now, the pain will only worsen. You must go now!”\\n\\n “What do you mean? I do not understand!”\\n\\n “He is calling you to him. You must go! I can feel his power all around you,” Cneajna urgently. “You must go now! He must not come looking for you and find us here!”\\n\\n I could feel the pain of the Beckoning ripping through me as I stumbled out into the graveyard. The wind ripped at me, no longer my friend, but my enemy. It tore viciously at my hair and dress, pushing and pummeling me along. Above me, the glorious moon was overcome by the menace of quickly forming storm clouds. The night was transforming all about me: growing darker and more menacing with every passing moment.\\n\\n “Glynis!”\\n\\n I heard his voice loudly, echoing within and without me. Again I felt a sharp pain within me, as though someone had wedged an anchor within me and was now pulling on the chain, wrenching me forward. I threw myself forward into the wind, letting the pull of the beckoning guide me. Hurtling forward, the world became a blur as I willed myself back to the castle. The forest and the sky became a surreal panorama as I flowed through the wind back to the place of my captivity.\\n\\n It was not until I finally fell against the great door of the castle that the pain of the beckoning lessened. The door swung open and I fell into the great hall. Rolling onto my back, I looked up into the cruel face of Vlad Dracula. His eyes were cold and he motioned to me briskly.\\n\\n “Come to the library,” he said.\\n\\n I struggled to my feet, but the pain was still great within me. I could feel the invisible cord that tied me to Vlad still pulling me along behind him. Staggering forward, I reached out to him.\\n\\n “Master, please. Please, release me of this pain!”\\n\\n Falling against him, I inadvertently clutched his medallion to keep myself from falling. Vlad held me close and I could feel the bond between us flare hot within me, then ebb away. Fully released of the power of his call, I stood trembling. He did not even look into my face, but brushed me aside and moved through the gloom of the castle.\\n\\n “Come, Glynis. Now.”\\n\\n “I am coming,” I snapped irritably.\\n\\n Anger, fresh and raw, was ignited within me. I hated his power over me. The power he had to keep me trapped in this damned castle. His power to call me back against my will to his side. The power he wielded over me to frighten me and force me to obey his commands. I hated him with every step I took. I hated myself for my weakness.\\n\\n Somehow, I will rise up and rob him of his power.\\n\\n “Hurry,” Vlad barked.\\n\\n I gritted my teeth as my eyes burned with rage, but I obeyed. I followed his dark, pensive form down the decaying corridors of the castle to the library he spent so many hours within planning and plotting his way to England.\\n\\n As Vlad entered the library, he threw off his long cloak and fell into a chair next to the table. His face was impassive, not a single emotion escaping his cold green eyes. He motioned me to the chair opposite him with a quick jab of one finger.\\n\\n Obediently, I sat down.\\n\\n Vlad stared at me for a long time, his gaze penetrating, yet devoid of emotion. The room was so silent, so dead, like a tomb, that when he did speak, his voice was like a peal of thunder.\\n\\n “We have a matter to discuss, dear wife,” he started. His hands slid a stack of papers across the table to me. “It has been more than half a year since you joined my household.”\\n\\n I started in my chair, my mouth agape in surprise. “It cannot be!”\\n\\n “Oh, but it is.”\\n\\n I quickly sorted through my thoughts, remembering my journey here, my rebirth, the events since that time, the dates at the top of Andrew’s letters, the change of the season. Over seven months of torment had passed, feeling more like the passing of a month or two.\\n\\n “Glynis, please pay attention,” Vlad said shortly.\\n\\n I snapped my head up, fastening my gaze upon him. “I apologize. I was lost in thought. What were you saying?”\\n\\n “There is much we have to discuss.” Vlad gave me a piercing look. “Now listen. Your brother has written my solicitor informing to inform me he will be coming to Buda. In fact, according to the dates he has given, he is already in transit. He is bringing along an English physician to examine you. He wants Sir Stephen to bring him here to our home so that you may be examined and the physician can determine if you can travel back to England.”\\n\\n I let out a cry and quickly stifled it behind my hand. Andrew was coming here! To save me! No, he could not! Vlad would destroy him!\\n\\n “No! He cannot!” I rose sharply to my feet and stood boldly before Vlad. “I will not allow you to harm him!”\\n\\n Vlad stood, took me by the shoulders, forcing me back into the chair. “Do not be a simpleton! I do not intend to harm him. I need him. I will not make another mistake by destroying my connections to English society. I need you to listen to me, Glynis, and not be your usual annoyingly opinionated self!”\\n\\n I gripped his cold, dry hand firmly, my gaze imploring him. “Promise me you will not harm him. Promise me!”\\n\\n Vlad slapped me hard across the cheek. “Listen to me and stop your dramatics.”\\n\\n I could taste blood on my tongue and seeping down my throat. Though I wanted to fight back, I resisted, reminding myself of my vow to my brother and his family, and once more played the obedient wife.\\n\\n Vlad slid the papers in front of me. “This is the letter your brother wrote. My solicitor has studied the itinerary your brother sent us and has charted his journey. He should arrive in Buda in two weeks. Instead of journeying here, I plan to meet him in Buda.”\\n\\n “He will insist on seeing me,” I said in a low voice. “He will demand that you bring him here.”\\n\\n “But I will not bring him here,” Vlad responded. Before I could protest he added,” I am taking you to Buda with me.”\\n\\n It took a few seconds for me to fully comprehend what he had said. “You are taking me to Buda?”\\n\\n Vlad nodded his head, sitting down next to me. “I need your help to deceive your brother. We will journey to Buda and stay in my home there. Sir Stephen will have your brother stay with him. My house is undergoing several restorations at this time. I need to make some additions to ensure our safety against vampire hunters. Your brother should understand we do not wish to inconvenience him, but that we cannot accept guests at this time. We will tell your brother that we have married and that you are now Countess Dracula of Wallachia. Is this clearly understood by you?\\n\\n I nodded, too overcome to say a word.\\n\\n “We will explain that your face has been disfigured by the accident, but that I fell in love with you and took you as my most beloved bride.”\\n\\n “Disfigured?” I frowned. “I do not understand.”\\n\\n Vlad reached out and caressed my face tenderly with one hand. “You are more beautiful than you were. A mortal that did not know you in your previous life would take your beauty as breathtaking and extraordinary, but not supernatural. But a mortal who knew you well would instantly see that you are more than human now. Your brother would only have to look into your eyes and see that you are Undead. I want your brother to help us establish an estate in England and arrange our entrance into British society as aristocrats. I do not want him to fear us or betray us to the vampire hunters. Do you understand?”\\n\\n It was so much to absorb. Andrew coming to this strange, terrifying yet beautiful land. Vampire hunters stalking Vlad. The deceit over my appearance. And the glorious thought of traveling to Buda. I was overcome with emotion.\\n\\n “Yes, yes, I do understand,” I answered finally.\\n\\n In truth, I do not want my brother to see me as I am now. I am ashamed of my ethereal beauty and sensuality. To have Andrew see what I have become is too horrible to bear. I still recall my mother’s aghast expression when she had finally realized the vampire standing before her was actually her daughter.\\n\\n “Good. Once in Buda I will have a veil made to cover your face. Now listen carefully. I do not want you to take any dress, piece of jewelry, or anything that your brother would recognize. I told him all was lost in the accident and if he sees you in any gown you owned in England, he will doubt my word. Take the dresses your mother bought for you in Paris and I will give you Erzsébet’s jewels to wear. Understand?”\\n\\n “Yes, Master,” I answered softly. I could barely believe what I was hearing him say. I am leaving the castle to go to Buda! To visit my brother! It is marvelous and frightening. To see Andrew will be marvelous, but I am so afraid for him. Vlad tends to be so temperamental. Andrew could be in great danger.\\n\\n “You know the power of the beckoning now. When I call you, you must always come to me. In Buda I will grant you the freedom you do not have here. You will hunt on your own and learn the powers of the night. It is time for you to show your loyalty to me and prepare to rise to the position of my true bride. When we journey to England and establish ourselves there, you will be my first bride and I want to trust you.” \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-tale-of-the-vampire-bride-vampire-bride-1/page-37.html","bookId":2614,"book":{"id":2614,"title":"The Tale Of The Vampire Bride (Vampire Bride #1)","description":"Storyline: The Tale Of The Vampire Bride (Vampire Bride #1) \\n Set in the 1820s, The Tale of the Vampire Bride is sure to thrill fans of vampires of literary past with its lush, gothic atmosphere and terrifying spectacle. \\n All Lady Glynis Wright ever wanted was the freedom to live life as she pleased, despite her aristocratic parents\u0027 wishes for her to marry into wealth.
