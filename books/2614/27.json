They do not know the secrets I have learned.”\n “Ah, but I remember your protest, my good friend. I remember when I first came to you for assistance in establishing myself in the world of mortals.”\n I hate the way Dracula’s eyes glow like dark coals in the darkness of the night. The Count was in good humor tonight, his visit to Buda being the success he had desired. But Dracula being in good humor can be even more dangerous than his dark moods. I could tell he was chiding me and playing with me like a mere child. But perhaps that is all I am when compared with his great years.\n “Oh, yes,” I said, trying to smile. “I was foolish and naive. But I have served you well, have I not, Master?”\n “Yes, you have, my dear friend.”\n I glanced out of the carriage window. A storm was moving swiftly over the valley, obscuring the moon. “Did you call that storm?”\n Count Dracula looked at the dark mass gliding resolutely across the sky and dismissed the storm clouds with a motion of his hand. “No, that one is of God. Did I tell you I sent a rather marvelous storm after the Earl when he tried to escape me with his family?”\n “No, you did not. I am sure it was quite impressive.” Vastly uncomfortable at the thought of the demise of my friend, Edric, and his family and the significant role I had played, I squirmed in my seat. Now I knew he was trying to make me uncomfortable. His good humor was a mask hiding his disappointment, nay, his anger with me.\n “It was lovely. Almost as lovely as my new Bride. She is a most beautiful creature.” His eyes narrowed slightly. “Do you not think so?”\n “So only Glynis remains, I assume,” I said softly, avoiding answering him. I stared at the window at the storm, attempting to distract myself. But I could not. I squirmed, averting my gaze from the Master.\n Count Dracula watched me with amusement. “How easily you sent them to me knowing their possible fate. Your guilt does not quite suit you.”\n I choked for a moment, startled by his words. The Master knew me well. For it was not guilt I felt, but the fear my actions would be discovered by the authorities. “He was a friend, but a friend is not as important to me as you are, Master. I serve you.” I knew my words would please him.\n He smiled slightly. “And I pay you well.”\n “Yes, my Master. But beyond the monetary rewards of my service, I cling to your promise of an immortal life. To serve a man such as you for an eternity would be the greatest pleasure. My wife’s father often speaks of your great victories over the Turks.”\n Count Dracula smiled, but his eyes remained shrewd and considering as he gazed at me. “Yes, I remember the victories of my mortal life. And one day, I will not remain trapped in my own country, but take my place once more in the halls of power.”\n Every time Count Dracula speaks of power, it thrills me, for I capture a glimpse of the world I will one day join.\n Since the first time Count Dracula entered my bedroom in the night and seduced me with the promise of immortality, I knew I was destined for greatness. I have labored long and hard for Count Dracula, building up his wealth and once more establishing him in Hungarian society as Count Vlad Dracula, a distant descendent of Vlad Tepes the Impaler, of the Dracul family. I may not be the most handsome of men or the most charming, but I am an aristocrat with connections and a shrewd businessman with all the necessary connections in the mortal world that Count Dracula needs. Over the years, Count Dracula has occasionally spoken of being a prisoner to this land and his desire to move freely in the mortal world, but I cannot understand what he means. He travels to and fro through the empire and wields power that mere men cannot imagine.\n I often wonder if there is a vampire society I am not aware of. Is he their ruler? Will I one day - err, night - rule at his side?\n I will do anything to protect my position as Count Dracula’s trusted adviser. Even betray an old school chum and his family by sending them to Count Dracula. Edric had been pleasant enough, but I admit, I always resented his great success and wealth. I do feel badly about Antoinetta and May, but that little twit Glynis can suffer her fate. In a moment of weakness, I had tried to plant a kiss on her lovely mouth, but she rebuffed me. She should never be so talkative and witty if she does not expect a man to respond to her seductions. Yes, she deserved her fate, the little tramp. But it is really too bad about the rest of the family.\n But I digress…I found Count Dracula staring at me intently. I had been so deep in my own thoughts, I wondered if I had missed part of the conversation.\n “Yes, my Master,” I said anxiously.\n “You are a cunning man, Stephen. Such dreams you have,” the Count said smiling, then sank back into the shadows of the carriage as only he can do.\n I swallowed hard and wondered if he could read my thoughts.\n Our escort of armed guards riding on black horses drew up to the carriage. The guards are for me, not Count Dracula. These are dangerous parts. All sorts of horrible deaths await travelers in the Carpathian Mountains, not just at the hands of the vampires, but thieves, bandits and dangerous bands of Gypsies. Though I know the guards are merely well-dressed mercenaries, I do feel safe within their care.\n Thunder churned in the distance and the wind rocked the carriage even more than the treacherous pass we were traveling. But beyond the sounds of the night, I heard something more.\n Leaning toward the window, I stared out toward the castle we were quickly advancing on. Faintly, just beyond the edges of my hearing, I heard the strangest of sounds. It was like the gentle sigh of a woman mixed with a raging scream…no…like a seductive song whispered…nay…a low growl. It was confusion to my ears yet alluring. Even now, I cannot describe what I heard.\n Count Dracula was virtually invisible in his cloak of shadows, only his ominously glowing eyes visible through the gloom.\n I absolutely abhor visiting the castle.\n As the carriage turned into the courtyard, Count Dracula’s eyes seemed to burn even brighter. “Ah, what is this?”\n I leaned toward the window and my breath caught.\n The great door to the castle was thrown open and four beautifully exotic women were gathered in the doorway. Their gossamer gowns, pale as the purest moonlight, and their long billowing hair danced around their voluptuous bodies as the cool breeze caressed them. Strange words, whispered and fervent escaped from their blood red lips, their pink tongues darting between glistening white fangs. Arms moving in fluid, seductive motions beckoned to me. The intoxicating sound that wafted on the night breeze called to me.\n I found myself fumbling with the carriage door latch, my eyes riveted to the pale beautiful women with the sharp features and blood red lips.\n Their voices…their voices…even now..I remember how they whispered to me…\n Come to us…\n Let us kiss you…\n Let us caress you…\n We want you…\n Desire you…\n Need you…\n Love you…\n Let us love you…\n Kiss you…\n Taste you…\n Even now I feel the heat of their words and, in that horrible moment, I wanted to escape the confines of the damned carriage and throw myself into their waiting arms. Already, I could feel their lips against mine, their hands on my body, their bodies against mine…\n “Foolish little man!”\n I was struck forcefully and knocked back into my seat. Thank goodness, the Count struck me down in my foolish lust. I still wanted to go to them, but I felt the force of Count Dracula’s power holding me in place.\n “I need you, so do not be a fool!”\n My body was shivering violently as I blurted out, “But, they called…”\n Count Dracula dismissed me with a flick of his hand, and said, “Another fool approaches them.”\n A guard moved toward the Brides of Dracula answering their siren call. He nearly stumbled over the body of what appeared to be a hunter prostrate at the feet of the women, but he caught himself. Extending his hands toward them, the handsome, swarthy young man relinquished his life. The Brides caught hold of him and drew him into their arms. Closing in around him, their sly seductive laughter slithered through the air.\n I watched in horror, unable to look away. After a long moment, a Bride raised her head and seemed to look directly at me. It took me a few moments to recognize that the beauty with the long rivulet of blood tracing down her chin was the red haired Lady Glynis. It gave me an awful start. I turned away and cowered in the darkness of the carriage. And still, I felt the coldness of her stare.\n “I shall be in contact with you soon, my friend,” the Count said coolly.\n Count Dracula gracefully descended from the carriage and moved toward the castle. He must have signaled the coachman, for the carriage lurched forward.\n I sat back, trembling. Deathly cold fingers traced down my spine. I felt as if I had witnessed my own death. How easily I had almost gone to them. To her! Her gaze upon me has left me cold and only the sight of the rising sun this morning has given me any measure of peace.\n The Journal of Lady Glynis Wright\n The Castle\n 5th of September, 1819\n Last night, when Vlad returned, I stood in the doorway and watched the carriage depart carrying the man who had betrayed my family try and hide from my gaze. Sir Stephen had not seemed surprised to see what we truly are and now I fully realize that he sent us to our deaths in service to his Master. The bitter taste of his betrayal made the blood I had consumed lose its flavor and I almost spat on the floor.\n Behind me, Vlad stood over the other Brides. I glanced back at him and saw his green eyes glimmering with dark satisfaction.\n The unfortunate young man that had answered our call was completely drained of his rich life blood and lay on the floor, nothing more than a pale bloodless body cluttering up the doorway to the castle. I remember gazing at him almost with disgust. How easily he had come to us.\n The Brides slowly gathered about Vlad, cooing and whispering, holding out their hands in supplication, as I stood and watched the carriage disappear.\n “You have returned, Master, sweet Master,” Ariana exclaimed emotionally, kissing his hands.\n “We longed for your return,” Elina declared breathlessly as she ran her hands over his hair.\n “We were starving,” Cneajna dared to say. “We needed you!”\n Like fawning cats, they rubbed seductively against him, caressing him with their bodies and hands.\n Save for me.\n I stood over the dead guard, staring into his hollow eyes.\n “Come to me, my Bride,” Vlad called to me.\n I lifted my gaze. I knew in that moment they were burning with defiance. “You must bring us another.”\n Vlad hardly seemed to notice my outburst. He amorously kissed Elina with his thick lips.\n “Do you hear me? It is not enough, damn you! It is not enough! It is never enough,!” I cried in anguish.\n The blood of the hunter who had stumbled across us earlier and the guard had made us soft, pale, and rosy once more with our hearts beating in our chest, but still the hunger was there. Clawing, pleading, needing to be fed.\n “It is enough for tonight,” Vlad said softly. Staring down into Ariana’s adoring eyes, he gently smoothed her tangled hair. “Tomorrow, I shall bring you another.”\n “We need more now! I feel the hunger deep within me! The need is gnawing at me!” I trembled with rage and desire. “We need to feed now.!”\n Vlad pointedly ignored me as he caressed his wives\u0027 faces and kissed their lips.\n “Do you hear me, you stupid bastard? Call back your carriage and give us those men! Give me Sir Stephen!”\n Slowly, Vlad’s darkly burning eyes slid toward me, his most defiant Bride. “Do not task me, Glynis,” he said in a low, threatening voice.\n “You made us what we are. You have starved us since you left. You cannot let us starve any longer!” \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-tale-of-the-vampire-bride-vampire-bride-1/page-27.html","bookId":2614,"book":{"id":2614,"title":"The Tale Of The Vampire Bride (Vampire Bride #1)","description":"Storyline: \n The Tale Of The Vampire Bride (Vampire Bride #1) \n Set in the 1820s, The Tale of the Vampire Bride is sure to thrill fans of vampires of literary past with its lush, gothic atmosphere and terrifying spectacle. \n All Lady Glynis Wright ever wanted was the freedom to live life as she pleased, despite her aristocratic parents\u0027 wishes for her to marry into wealth.
