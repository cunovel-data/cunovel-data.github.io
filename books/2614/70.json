Astir must have compelled Gregor to look up at him, for the hunter raised his eyes and let out a shriek so terrible that it made me flinch and look away. Magda sobbed in my arms and pressed her face into my shoulder as her son gripped our legs in terror. Gregor’s scream was long and terrified before it was sharply cut off. I looked up to see Astir looking at me in his quiet calm way, once more clad in his red robes, and the dhamphir gone. “Well, that was entertaining,” Astir decided. “Where is he? Did you kill him?” Vlad’s voice was imperious as always. “He is sputtering and wailing as he swims his way out of the Danube,” Astir answered with a satisfied expression. Ignatius gently touched Magda’s cheek, and then knelt to gaze at her son. “How are you, little man?” he asked. The little boy stared back at him. “The angel saved us.” Ignatius smiled. “Indeed he did.” “Oh, it was nothing,” Astir said, but looked mightily pleased with himself. “Thank you, sir, thank you,” Magda said in a fervent voice. “Really, it was all too much fun. I despise the hunters,” Astir responded. “They are so…tedious.” Ignatius ruffled the boy’s dark hair, then stood up to gaze at me. “Are you all right, Countess?” Vlad reached out and pulled me from them. “She will be fine. Once we feed, we shall both be fine.” Astir swept some imaginary dust from his arm. “Oh, yes. Of course. And we must let this dear lady and her son retire to their new chambers. Far too much excitement for a little one. Yes, yes, let him forget all that has happened. There. That is better.” Glynis looked toward Magda’s son to see he was giggling and snuggling into her skirts. The look of shock was gone from his gaze. “Thank you,” Magda whispered as she was escorted away by Astir’s butler. “Madam, please do not leave without saying good-bye.” “Of course I will come see you,” I promised. Vlad’s fingers tightened on my arm. I could feel the coldness of his gaze upon me. “Now to feed my hungry vampires. You all look simply awful and bedraggled,” Astir sniffed. He motioned us through one of his many curtained doorways. “Please, go feed, then we shall make sure you have some nice new clothes to wear. You look simply terrible.” With a wave of his hand, he vanished through another doorway. Ignatius pressed open the curtained doorway to reveal a small room filled with pillows and cushions of all shapes and colors. Lying among them were a collection of beautiful young men and woman, barely clothed, lounging about sipping wine and eating fresh fruit. All their eyes turned upon us as the curtain was drawn back and their eyes burned with the fever of anticipation. Vlad did not even hesitate. He swept into the room, knelt down, seized a young man, and bit into his throat. The man’s eyes fluttered with pleasure as he gripped Vlad’s strong arms with his pink hands. I stood in the doorway in shock. To see such a bounty of willing victims was startling. “Feed, Glynis,” Ignatius whispered, and gently nudging me forward. Then, he, too, swept into the room and went down upon his knees among the willing victims. Two women reached out to him, their hands gliding over his arms and chest. I felt anger at the sight, but then my hunger began to speak . I looked away just as he bit into the throat of one of the young women. Hesitantly, I stepped deeper into the candlelit room and the smell of rich blood filled my senses. Vlad let go of the young man. His victim fell back in a swoon as Vlad seized the nearest woman. His fangs flashed in the dim light, then she cried out as his sharp teeth pierced her neck. Turning away, I walked among the humans lounging on the floor, my dirty, burnt skirt brushing against their naked skin. They reached out to me with eager hands, beckoning to me in soft voices. I knew not what I was looking for but I looked down at all the upturned faces searchingly. A fine, tall, well-muscled African lay toward the back of the room. He was handsome with his black skin and clean-shaven head. His dark eyes looked up at me, keen and eager. Two women lay with him, twined about him like vines. Silently, he reached out to me and I went to him. He tilted back his head and I bit deeply. When his blood filled me, I knew then I had been seeking out a warrior, a man of strength, and I fed from him until he could give no more. His women tried to hold me to them, but I slipped free of them and stood up. My men, my vampire lovers, were moving from one throat to the next, taking small, but healing drinks. I felt angry at the two vampires as they moved over their victims, taking so eagerly what was needed. I had nearly drained my victim. He now lay sleeping, weakened from my feeding. I swept past both of them into the foyer. “We do not kill here,” Astir said as the curtain fell back behind me. “I did not kill him,” I answered. “You nearly did,” Astir pointed out. I licked my lips as tears sprung in my eyes, then shook my head. “I did not though.” “He will not die. I will see to that, but you must be careful, Glynis. Your anger may spur you to dangerous decisions,” Astir advised. “Where is my chamber?” Astir frowned at me. “You truly are a stubborn woman.” “Yes, I truly am.” I covered my breasts with my cloak and gave him my most imperious look. “I want to change, please.” “Very well.” Astir waved a hand. “Go to your chamber. But remember what I have warned.” “Your words sting my soul, sir. I cannot forget them,” I said. Astir laughed, shaking his head. “Oh, I so do like you.” I stomped my foot, turning away. I found myself gazing at a beautiful blue gown resting on an opulent bed. I twirled about again to find Astir and the hallway gone. Once more, he had transported me into one of the haven’s many chambers. Moving to the bed, I looked down at the gown and saw that in its folds was my journal…this journal in which I now write. Astir, it seems, wields power beyond even his haven to produce that which his patrons most desire. So now I write. I write of tonight’s events as I wait for Vlad to return from his gluttony. I feel strangely angry at Ignatius. Perhaps because I have never seen him feed off of such beautiful young women, I have never had the opportunity to be jealous. I do not know what shall happen next, but I feel a great sense of foreboding. The world as I have known it has once more ceased to exist. Chapter 34 The Journal of Lady Glynis Wright 2nd of May, 1820 I now know that all Astir prophesied is true. All that he warned me of has come to pass. My soul feels numbed by all that has happened, but at last I see the painful truth. My last night in Buda was spent in Astir’s haven. After I had changed into the beautiful blue gown he provided, I sat down and wrote all that I had experienced. It was a welcome relief to relate all I had endured and find some measure of understanding of my own emotions. I must admit I was quite thrown emotionally to be in the presence of both my Master and my lover. Just as I finished writing, large traveling trunks were brought into the room, filled with my possessions. I started to question the footmen how my things had survived the fire, but then understood I must accept that Astir is more powerful than I realized. Once the men departed I hid my journal deep in one trunk and moved to stand by the fire. I felt disconcerted by all that had occurred and knew that Vlad’s suspicion was a dangerous thing indeed. But I knew not how to assuage it. If anything, if I tried to calm his fears, he would only become more distrustful. “May we enter?” Astir’s voice asked from behind me. I turned to see Astir standing in the doorway with Ignatius behind him. A smile touched my lips as I saw that Ignatius was recovered from his earlier wounds and dressed in a long red coat. He returned my smile with his own, but it was hesitant and bittersweet. “Yes, of course. I was waiting for Vlad to return.” “He is temporarily delayed,” Astir assured me. “By you?” I tilted my head, arching an eyebrow. Astir just smiled innocently. “I shall leave you two alone for a few moments.” He retreated back through the door as Ignatius stepped past him. Astir graced me with a tight little warning smile over Ignatius’ shoulder, then disappeared as the door shut. Ignatius came to me silently. I wrapped my arms around his neck and held him. I stroked his silky raven hair and pressed kisses to his cheek. Wordlessly, he kissed my face and my lips, then held my cheek firmly against his. We were both warm with the life we had stolen from our willing victims. I could feel his heart beating in his chest. We kissed again, quite sweetly and he rested his forehead against mine. I stroked his neck with my fingers, trying so very hard not to cry. “I should have let the dhamphir kill him,” he whispered at last. “Do not worry over that now,” I answered. “But he will now take you from the city and I know not when I will see you again,” Ignatius answered in quiet misery. “I will find my way to you,” I promised ardently. “I will. I promise.” He kissed me tenderly. “I love you.” “And I love you.” “Come, Ignatius,” Astir’s voice said from behind him. I gazed into the dark blue depths of Ignatius eyes as Astir’s hand drew him from me. In his eyes, I saw his great love for me. The two men vanished before my eyes just before the door opened and Vlad entered. My Master was at full strength, his brutal power emanating from him like hot flames. He glared at me as he strode toward me, clad in black, his long hair flowing around his face in thick curls. He grabbed me by my throat and gazed deeply into my eyes. I glared back at him, fierce and bold, and he abruptly smiled before releasing me. “I am a fool to think anyone could conquer you,” he said with a laugh. “Yet you try,” I answered glibly. Vlad shrugged, moving toward the fireplace. “We leave before dawn. Astir has provided us with a carriage.” “He also saved my possessions from the fire,” I said pointing to the trunks. Vlad glanced toward the luggage. “He is a creature of great power.” “Do you fear him?” “No,” Vlad answered. “Why should I?” “You are very much the dragon, are you not?” “Yes, I am. I am brutal, strong, and protective of what is mine. For a moment, I thought perhaps my brother had somehow managed to steal your heart.” “Really? I barely met him just tonight.” Vlad looked at me piercingly. “You lie.” I shrugged. “But I realized, looking into those cold beautiful eyes of yours, no one can truly conquer you. That knowledge makes you so very desirable.” I waved my hand at him, dismissing his words. He came to my side in a flash and gripped me firmly by my hair, wrenching my head to one side. He looked deeply into my eyes and said, ”Never again will another man touch what is mine. Understood?” “I know not what you speak of,” I lied. He just gave me his most fierce, feral smile. “Yes, you do. I shall kill any man, brother or no, that touches you.” He released me and walked to the trunks. My traveling cloak lay on one. He picked it up and tossed it to me. “We leave now.” Catching the cloak, I held it against me. “Where are we going?” “I told Ignatius we are going to Vienna,” Vlad answered. “But we are not.”","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-tale-of-the-vampire-bride-vampire-bride-1/page-70.html","bookId":2614,"book":{"id":2614,"title":"The Tale Of The Vampire Bride (Vampire Bride #1)","description":"Storyline: The Tale Of The Vampire Bride (Vampire Bride #1) Set in the 1820s, The Tale of the Vampire Bride is sure to thrill fans of vampires of literary past with its lush, gothic atmosphere and terrifying spectacle.
