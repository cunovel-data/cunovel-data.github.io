Vlad smiled, his lips revealing his sharp teeth. “You amuse me, dear wife.” “Then your life will not be boring with me in it,” I answered. He flung back his head, laughed, and released me. “We shall talk soon, wife. We shall talk soon, but tonight, I shall indulge myself.” He buried his face in Ariana’s neck and drew her tight against him. She cooed and wrapped her limbs around him. I turned from them, released from my torment, despite the carnage that lay about me. I would surrender to the hunger, but I would find my own way. And I would be stronger for it. Slick with blood, but strong in spirit, I walked from the throne room, transformed, released and determined. Now I sit alone, writing, and knowing fully that my resolve to escape, to fulfill my promise to my mother, will be fruitful. I saw in Vlad’s eyes tonight a glimmer of respect. I realize he is now enamored with my strength and cunning. If I am wise, if I am clever, I may be able to use this to free myself. Though I have given into the beast that is the hunger, I am not afraid. I am still Lady Glynis Wright. Chapter 15 The Journal of Lady Glynis Wright-The Castle 12th of October, 1819 I have not written in my diary for so long. I have tried to set pen to paper on several occasions, but could not bear to record the drudgery that has become my existence. Since the night of our feast, I have played a dangerous game with Vlad. I acquiesce to his demands in order to bide my time. I know that I am growing stronger as time goes on, and if he believes me to be obedient, he is more likely to allow us to feed and not go hungry. At first I felt very clever in my plans to lure him into believing that I am resigned to be his Bride, but of late I have begun to chaff at the restrictions on my life. I have grown increasingly defiant. I was beginning to doubt my plans, but now I see I must curb my natural desire to war against Vlad. Tonight, a new moon hid its face from the night and darkness dwelt heavily over the land. As soon as I awakened I was in a pensive mood. A heaviness in my heart came with awareness. Dread permeated my every thought. When I slipped from my coffin, I stood in morose silence, seeking to find the will to venture out into the night. I had grown so weary of this new life with its constraints and I yearned for England and my family. At last, I followed the sounds of my vampire sisters chasing each other through the castle. Their gaiety was repugnant to me, but I found myself at a loss as to what to do to get me through the barren night. I followed the sound of the vampire women laughing and ended up wandering out into the night. Within the tangled web of the gardens of the castle, Dracula’s Brides played with no regard to the lack of moonlight. Laughing with delight, Cneajna prowled through the darkness, peering under decaying benches and pressing the dead foliage aside with her hands. Her eyes glimmered with red fire as I watched her seek out my sisters. I drew near a fountain and stared into the night sky. I was in no mood to indulge myself in their games. Ariana moved past me, crawling along the floor like a strange insect on her fingertips and toes. I looked away from her disturbing form into the dank, still waters of the fountain. A faint reflection gazed up at me from the murky water, and I sighed sadly. There was wild laughter when Cneajna uncovered Elina hiding behind a tree and there was a mad dash through the dead garden. I watched them as their long hair and skirts flowed around them as they rushed deeper into the gloom and further away. I was glad for it. I returned my gaze to the night sky. I watched for any sign of the stars to give me comfort. All that greeted my gaze were thick, heavy clouds that loomed over me like a crushing hand. Then, out of that dismal sky, fell a small speck of silvery ice. I watched in silent reverie as the first snowflake fell to earth. Then another followed, dancing on the night breeze, twisting as it fell. I stepped into its path and felt its cold little kiss on my cheek. Then the sky opened and the snow fell, sweetly, softly, to hide away the dead plants of the garden and fill the night with glowing brightness. Vlad found me in the garden, enraptured by the beauty of the snowfall. My gaze was turned upwards as I watched the dance of the snowflakes. “Glynis,” he said softly from the doorway. I turned to him, my gaze narrowing. I knew I was visibly upset with his interruption of my small moment of peace. “Yes?” “A word with you,” he said, beckoning to me with one hand. His green eyes were thoughtful as he gazed upon me. I sighed, stepping toward him. There was a soft crunch beneath my slipper and I looked down to see the ground was already covered in a fine layer of powder. “Come along, Glynis. I have some business that must be attended to and I need your assistance.” He looked past me and motioned with his hand. I glanced over my shoulder to see the three Brides emerging from the snow, their gowns seeming to dissolve into the swirling flakes. “Ariana and Elina, I need both of you to leave the castle. There is a man staying at the inn in the village. He is waiting for you. I will soon have a parcel ready for you to take to him. Dress as Gypsy women, then wait for my summons.” “As you desire, Master,” Ariana said, sliding past him with a flirtatious smile. Elina followed her, casting a curious glance in my direction. Cneajna strolled up to us, regarding Vlad curiously. “You look pensive, my husband. What concerns you so?” “You need not worry, Cneajna,” Vlad responded in a distracted tone, his fingers lightly stroking his beard as he gazed intently at me. I could see the apprehension in Cneajna’s blue eyes. Her lush red mouth pursed pensively, and I felt a pang of sorrow for her. There was something about her gaze. It was so beautiful, so potent, so lonely, and I knew nothing I did or said to her would make it fade from her lovely features. “Glynis, come…now.” Vlad said, holding out his hand to me. “We must go to my library.” Reluctantly, I moved to his side, my jewelry tinkling softly. We left Cneajna, alone, in the snow, staring after us with a winsome, yet worried expression on her face. Oftentimes, I felt that Vlad disregarded how much she truly loved and pined for him. But he is a brute, so why should I be surprised that he would deny her very real love for him? I obediently followed him through the long hallways and steep staircases to the library he often took refuge in. A fire was lit in the fireplace and the room seemed almost cheery. Papers were spread out on a table and Vlad motioned to a chair. I took my seat as he slid into his. His brow furrowed as his hands lightly touched several of the documents as I waited in silence. Finally, he said in a low voice, “I have been planning to move to England for some time now. I spoke the truth to your parents about my desire to leave my home here and establish myself in London.” His green eyes slowly raised to stare into mine. “I wish to buy an estate in England and move there to live as an aristocrat and a gentleman.” I tried not laugh at his usage of the word gentleman. He continued, “Last year I told Sir Stephen my plans to move to England and that I needed to wed an Englishwoman. An aristocrat. When he heard that your family was visiting Rome, he wrote to your father and invited your family to Buda. Then he contacted me.” I felt my mouth fall open as I realized the extent of Sir Stephen’s betrayal of my family. I had thought he had merely obeyed Vlad by sending us to him. It was horrific that he had actually lured us to Buda and into a trap. “Do you remember that night you attended the opera? I nodded, remembering the night vividly. It had been a few days after our arrival in Buda. I had dressed in an elegant ivory gown my mother had purchased for me in Paris. Despite the finery I wore and the jewels that had adorned my throat and wrists, I had felt rather put out. In fact, I had felt ill the entire night and had hidden in the back of the box, ignoring the performance on the stage. “That is when I first saw you. I sat in the box across from your family and watched the shadows caress your beautiful face. It was then I knew I wanted you to be my mortal Bride. I was inspired by your beauty.” Vlad’s gaze swept over my face and he smiled with satisfaction. “I made additional inquiries about your family to Sir Stephen. He was very informative about your family and their dealings.” I was surprised at his compliment to my beauty, but annoyed by his confession of Sir Stephen’s betrayal of my family. “He’s such a little sniveling toad.” Vlad laughed slightly. “Yes, he is, but a very loyal subject. I called on Sir Stephen and told him that I desired you. But I could no longer remain in Buda. The vampire hunters were stalking me, and my home in Buda was under suspicion. That is when Sir Stephen sent you to me.” I lowered my eyes and swallowed hard. It was painful to hear how this monster had lured my family all this way, had us journey so long, only to murder them and destroy me. All because he thought me beautiful, and I suited his plans. “It was a mistake to bring your family here. I had forgotten how pompous and self-righteous the British are. The death of your family was never my intention.” The look I bestowed him with was filled with my fury, but he ignored it, “I am so sorry their deaths inconvenienced you,” I said sharply. He frowned at me. “If your father had accepted my proposal of marriage, they would all be alive today. All he had to do was accept and leave you here as my wife. Later, you would have accompanied me back to England after they prepared for our arrival.” “How smug of you to believe I would have agreed to any of this! That I would be your happy, besotted wife and do as you said!” I could not help myself. He was just so sure that his original plan would have worked if only my father had not stood up to him! “You would have learned to love me. All mortal women love men with power.” “Never! I never would have loved you. I despised you from the beginning,” I said rather shortly. Vlad just smiled, gesturing with the sweep of his hand. “It does not matter now. Those plans are dead to us as is your family.” I hissed softly, and though he looked bemused, his eyes narrowed. “You have been in my household for several months now. You are learning to love your new sisters and to accept what you are. Now you must prove your loyalty to me.” “I hate you,” I responded. Vlad reached out and gently stroked my cheek then took a firm hold of the back of my neck and drew me to him. “I know you hate me, but loyalty to one does not also mean that you must love the one you serve.” I wrinkled my nose at him, and said, “I do not serve you. I am your prisoner.” Vlad turned his head slightly, his green eyes never straying from my face. It was if he considered his words before speaking them. He abruptly released me, sitting back in his chair. “Your brother has written my solicitor in Buda.” I started in my chair and for a moment I was overwhelmed with fear. The visage of my beloved brother swam before my eyes. I felt tears, hot and fierce well in my eyes. “He actually wrote to your parents first. When there was no response, he wrote to Sir Stephen inquiring as to the whereabouts of your family. He is my solicitor in Buda. Did you know that?” My eyes narrowed. “No, I did not. I thought him merely your lapdog.” Vlad lightly ran his fingertips along the edge of a goblet sitting on the table. I could smell the blood within. “I spoke the truth when I told you that I planned to marry you and move to England.” His eyes darkened and his voice deepened as he said, “But your father defied me and those plans were lost to me. Or so I thought.” “You made me a vampire. I cannot be your devoted mortal wife any longer.” “That is true, but that does not necessarily mean I should abandon my plans. Sir Stephen was under strict orders to not allow anyone to know your destination. Your brother’s letter mentions me by name. Obviously, he failed.”","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-tale-of-the-vampire-bride-vampire-bride-1/page-32.html","bookId":2614,"book":{"id":2614,"title":"The Tale Of The Vampire Bride (Vampire Bride #1)","description":"Storyline: The Tale Of The Vampire Bride (Vampire Bride #1) Set in the 1820s, The Tale of the Vampire Bride is sure to thrill fans of vampires of literary past with its lush, gothic atmosphere and terrifying spectacle.
