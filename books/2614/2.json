His dark eyes looked almost crazed with fear. “The pass to the village has been cut off. There was a big storm. It blew down many large rocks and blocked the way. The only other road leads up into the mountains.”\n “Will it take us to the village? We have a very important connection to make there,” Father said impatiently.\n “It is a dangerous road. Very dangerous.” Ovidiu looked as if he were about to sit down on the ground and cry.\n “We have no choice. Take the high road to the village,” Father ordered.\n While they spoke I was studying the road intently. The carriage was a little beyond the break in the road. The lower road obviously led toward the small village where we were due to arrive that night. The carriage had skidded when the driver abruptly reined the horses up onto the high road, crashing through the foliage.\n “It is a dangerous way!” Ovidiu shook his head. “Too dangerous to go that way!”\n “Father, where did the boulders come from? Not off this road.” I stared down at the strange barricade. “It is as if they were set there.”\n Father was irritated with our guide. He was a man who expected to be obeyed without question. “It is dangerous, but it is also the only road open to our destination. We are expecting a carriage to pick us up tomorrow in the village of Rosu. We must be there tonight!”\n “Night will come fast now. The sun is low,” Ovidiu said. His anxious dark eyes darted toward the descending sun.\n “Yes, yes. Light the lanterns on the carriage. Let us be off. We are wasting time!”\n I reached out to Father. I was very bothered by the way the road was blocked. It seemed so deliberate. “The boulders, Father-”\n “It is a dangerous way!” Ovidiu looked stricken. “We can turn back now! We can be far away by the time the moon is full!”\n “Stuff and nonsense, Ovidiu. Light the lanterns and let us be off!” Father motioned at the driver that we were continuing on this high road.\n “Father!”\n “What is it, Glynis?”\n “The boulders down there-”\n “Yes, yes, what of them?” Father glanced down through the trees at the barrier blocking the lower road.\n “Where did they come from?”\n “We are in the mountains, Glynis. There are rocks of all shapes and sizes about. Now, into the carriage with you.”\n “But, it is so odd, Father!”\n “This is an odd country, Glynis.”\n I was ushered up into the carriage and seated reluctantly across from my mother.\n “It was as if they were placed there, Father. Do you not think it is odd? Maybe it is a sign.”\n Mother held May close as she tried to soothe my panicked sister. “What is a sign?”\n “The road being blocked. Maybe God does not want me to go see the Count. Maybe God has blocked our way as a sign to us,” I answered. I did not truly believe my words, but I dreaded continuing on with our journey.\n “This is 1819. I think we are far beyond believing in signs,” Father declared as he took his seat. He swung the door shut and knocked on the side of the carriage with his fist.\n The carriage lurched forward, and we began our ascent into the darkening forest.\n As the sun continued its journey downwards, dark shadows began to fill the valleys. I sat quietly pondering the strange configuration of large boulders that blocked our passage. May finally stopped whimpering and fell asleep in our mother’s arms. Father seemed lost in the wilderness of his own mind, staring blindly out the window. Silence filled our tiny haven.\n The climb was treacherous, but as the sun continued to sink below the craggy mountaintops, the horses raced on more swiftly than before. We were rattled about the carriage with every curve in the road .\n I could feel the urgency in the driver’s voice as he prodded the horses to greater momentum. The rumble of thunder could be heard rolling through the mountains as foreboding dark clouds rolled overhead obscuring the starry sky. The sun vanished with one last glimmer through the pine trees, then night took possession of the earth.\n As the sky transformed from light to dark, so did our mood. The day had been drenched with refreshing sunlight. The night was darker than any I could recall, the air stifling. I felt as though I could not even take a full breath. The darkness filling the carriage smothered me.\n Strangely, my family also seemed to sense the change. We fell into an eerie silence. Mother’s mouth was clamped so tightly shut that her lips were as pale as the moon she so warily regarded.\n “What was that?” May whispered.\n “The neighing of the horses,” Father said, his voice slicing harshly through the darkness.\n A sharp yelp ripped out of the night.\n “Father, I heard something, too!” I gripped his arm tightly.\n It was then that Ovidiu began to call out shrilly. Even though it was in another language, I could have sworn his words were the Lord’s Prayer. As I heard the deep voice of the driver join in, I glanced with worry at my father.\n “Father, what did the driver say earlier?”\n “Glynis!” Mother’s voice was a hiss.\n “The dead travel fast,” my father answered. His uneasiness was very evident in his voice.\n I shivered at the thought. It was horribly morbid. Yet, somehow, fascinating. We were in such an exotic country with odd customs far removed from prim English society. I could only imagine what the driver had meant. Boldly, I leaned out the window.\n The cold wind tugged at my hair and clothes, nipping at my nose. Ahead of the carriage, the road twisted among the trees. I turned my gaze and immediately let out a small gasp.\n Three wolves, two dark gray, one white as the moonlight, were racing behind the carriage. The wolves\u0027 eyes seemed to flash with red fire. Their strong legs appeared to carry them on the wind itself. I could have sworn their great paws never touched the ground.\n The white wolf gazed directly into my eyes. For a moment, a cold, tight hand of fear gripped my body. Then the three wolves veered off the road and disappeared into the forest.\n I practically fell back into my seat, breathless with excitement. “There were wolves out there! Following us! It was most peculiar!”\n “What? Wolves?” Mother let out a little gasp.\n “Yes, wolves! There were three wolves running behind us,” I said. My eyes must have been very bright. “They were beautiful!”\n “Nonsense! The night is playing tricks on your mind!” Mother cast a fearful look toward the windows.\n “Truly I saw them! They were rushing along behind us!”\n May whimpered in fear and clutched Mother’s arm.\n “Edric, she is frightening her sister. Make her stop!”\n Father patted my arm lightly. “Be kind to your sister.”\n I frowned, then turned my gaze sharply out the window. Damn them all! They never believed me. I was not fanciful. I was merely much more observant than any of them cared to be.\n I felt the presence of the night all about me: a living, breathing entity, whispering soft words against my flesh. I had never before felt the silken touch of the night caress me as I did now. It was a frightening, yet exhilarating experience. It was as if the night itself were attempting to seduce me.\n As the horses’ hooves thundered and the night sky rumbled, all those within the frail carriage cowered except for me. Instead of feeling terror, I felt very much alive. I leaned out into the darkness beyond the carriage once more; my hands gripping the window frame as the cold wind pressed stinging kisses against my cheeks.\n “Glynis! Sit back!”\n I pointedly ignored my mother and watched as the forest began to thin. I could see the dark impression of the valley beneath us. For an instant, I thought I saw a flash of white. I strained to see and witnessed a glimmer of something pale racing through the trees. It had to be the ivory wolf.\n “Let me see you, please,” I called out, not truly understanding the meaning of my words.\n “I am here,” the wind seemed to answer me, and I felt quite mad.\n I saw a woman standing next to the road. A beautiful woman with her long blond hair and white gown billowing on the wind. The carriage sped past the apparition, and, impulsively, I stretched out my hand. To my surprise, the ghostly woman reached out as well, and our fingertips touched.\n With a gasp, I plunged my frozen finger into my mouth.\n The carriage lurched unexpectedly as the forest disappeared. I found myself staring down into a dark chasm. Glancing ahead, I saw the road was leading directly to a great castle resting on the edge of a precipice.\n “There is a castle ahead!”\n “A castle!” Mother forgot herself, leaning her head out of the window. “Thank God!”\n The horses began to whinny and the carriage lurched. The driver was trying to pull up on the reins to stop the carriage before it reached the vast courtyard of the castle.\n “Good God, Ovidiu! Do not stop them! There is shelter,” Father shouted out.\n Whatever the two frightened Transylvanians were attempting failed as the horses resisted. The carriage careened into the courtyard despite the efforts of the driver. Snorting and neighing, the horses clattered to a stop.\n “At last! Shelter!” Mother snuggled her frightened youngest daughter to her body. “It is shelter, my darling May.”\n “Thank goodness, Mama. I was so frightened!”\n I cast an annoyed glance at them, then stared out the window at the imposing castle. It had obviously fallen into disuse, and I doubted anyone should live within its walls. Its craggy exterior bid no welcome. I thought I saw a light above me. Glancing up, I saw a face peering down at me from one of the long narrow topmost windows. But as the clouds slipped over the full moon, the face vanished.\n Ovidiu whipped the door open and stared at us with horrified eyes. “We cannot stay here! We must leave!\n “Do not be ridiculous. We must consult with the master of this castle.” Father climbed down and straightened his coat. “We must take care of the women.” He stood on the ruined steps of the entrance, looking about at his dreary surroundings. He seemed not very encouraged by the sorry state of this gruesome castle, but he did have us to consider. He attempted to straighten his clothes and smooth his mussed graying red hair with his hands. Resolute, he marched up to the great ancient door of the castle, and then he hesitated.\n Peering out at my father, I thought I saw his demeanor change for a moment. He glanced back at me with the strangest look. I thought I saw fear in his eyes, then he regained his composure, rapped on the door and waited.\n “Please, sir, please, let us leave this place,” Ovidiu said piteously. He fearfully gazed at the door and clutched his hand to his heart.\n The door opened and light spilled out of the doorway. A man appeared carrying a lantern. He carried it low at his side and I could not make out his face.\n “I’m sorry to disturb you-“ Father began.\n “Earl Wright, this is most certainly a surprise. I did not expect you until tomorrow.” The voice coming from the stranger was low, seductive and powerful. It carried the accent of the country, and it chilled me to the bone.\n “It is the Count!” Mother smiled with relief, laying her hand over her heart. “All is well!”\n I glanced over at Ovidiu. The man was gesturing anxiously, looking more than a little afraid. I had the feeling that all was not as well as Mother thought.\n “I am surprised you found my home.”\n Father looked too startled to respond. “Yes, err, um...”\n The Count moved toward the carriage. “I take it this is your lovely family, Earl Wright.”\n “Yes, yes! We are all here per your kind invitation, sir. We did not expect to find your castle. It was quite by accident.”\n “A most delightful accident! But rest assured, many strange things happen on nights such as these in this country.” The Count reached the doorway of the carriage and lifted his lantern. His green eyes came sharply into focus and he stared directly at me. “Do they not, Lady Glynis?” \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-tale-of-the-vampire-bride-vampire-bride-1/page-2.html","bookId":2614,"book":{"id":2614,"title":"The Tale Of The Vampire Bride (Vampire Bride #1)","description":"Storyline: \n The Tale Of The Vampire Bride (Vampire Bride #1) \n Set in the 1820s, The Tale of the Vampire Bride is sure to thrill fans of vampires of literary past with its lush, gothic atmosphere and terrifying spectacle. \n All Lady Glynis Wright ever wanted was the freedom to live life as she pleased, despite her aristocratic parents\u0027 wishes for her to marry into wealth.
