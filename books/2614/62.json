I found myself in tears as I ripped off my dress and threw myself on the bed.\n Magda appeared before me, looking concerned, “Madam, shall I draw a bath?”\n Looking up at her, I wiped my tears away. “No, no. I am going to go out tonight. I need to feed.”\n My thoughts, of course, had turned to Ignatius. I needed to see him. To feel untainted by Vlad’s power. I could not bear to think of my trapped sisters starving into madness in the Carpathian Mountains or how Vlad had drawn me even closer to him through his blood. I wanted to be free of it all and merely be myself: Lady Glynis Wright.\n Dressing in one of my finest gowns of pale blue silk, I began to regain my senses and not feel the tears threatening. I sat at my vanity while Magda fixed my hair and adorned it with jeweled combs.\n “You look lovely,” Magda said finally.\n There were no mirrors in our home, so I could only believe her. I did feel lovely in my gown as I looked up at her. “Thank you, Magda.”\n Rising to my feet, I glanced at my tiny watch and tucked it into my purse. Moving toward the door, she hurried behind me with my cloak.\n “I will return near morning,” I told her.\n “I will have your bath ready,” she assured me.\n I only had a few minutes to reach the fountain in the gardens of the hotel if I wished to see Ignatius.\n “Shall I have them bring about the caleche?” she asked as she hurried down the stairs after me.\n “Oh, no. I am much quicker without it.”\n She nodded, but her brow furrowed worriedly.\n Flashing her my brightest smile, I threw open the door and hurried into the night. It was a lovely, clear evening with the stars glittering coldly in the sky. The breeze off the Danube was refreshing and cool against my skin.\n It was odd and somewhat overwhelming to realize that I felt more liberated this night than I had in a long time. As I rushed down the lane, I began to feel unshackled from the suffocating bond I now had with Vlad. Away from our home, I felt a renewed sense of self as his presence began to fade from my mind. My fear and loathing of him had so tainted my thoughts that I had not realized the full depth of my despair until it began to dissipate.\n Hurrying past the estates of Buda’s wealthiest, I cast a disparaging eye upon the home of Sir Stephen. I missed the presence of my brother, but I must admit I am relieved that he is returning home to England. To know he is safely away is a great comfort to me.\n Reaching the bottom of the hill, I slowed to a more human pace and patted down my hair and dress. Glancing about to make certain no one was about, I leapt easily over the wall and into the garden beyond. Landing elegantly, I adjusted my skirts and strolled down the path.\n Ignatius was seated near the fountain reading a small book. His hair was much longer tonight and held back by a silver clasp. Dressed in an elegant scarlet velvet coat and black long trousers, he was quite striking.\n As I drew near, he glanced up at me and slightly smiled. Tucking away the book in his coat pocket, he rose, taking my hands in his.\n “I cannot express how infinitely joyful I am to see you,” he said.\n I giggled at his words while smacking him with my fan. “You are too much.”\n He chuckled and kissed my hand lightly. His dark blue eyes gazed at me with delight as he tucked my hand into the crook of his arm and lead me down the path.\n “I admit I was hoping you would join me tonight. Word is your Master is out of town and I dared to hope to see you,” he said.\n “I can assure you that every chance I have to see you I shall grip firmly with both hands and hold onto tightly. It has been a difficult month. I daresay that I have not been in the best frame of mind.”\n He nodded, his long face somber. “I know. I feel it. What he did to you.”\n I turned my face away, embarrassed and distraught. I was uncertain what he meant. I was distressed to think he would know that I had lain with Vlad after being with him.\n “He renewed his bond with you. I can feel it. It is stronger than before.” He looked quite sad as he said these words.\n “I will not always be with him,” I said firmly. “I can promise you that much. I cannot allow myself to continue as I am now. I despise him and I loathe that I am bound to him.”\n Ignatius turned to me, his hand raising mine to his lips. Kissing my fingers, he whispered against my skin. “If you despise him and love me, than I can endure our complicated existence a bit better. I have never loved any woman as I love you. You have complicated my life beyond my expectations, but I am willing to wait for that night you are mine and mine alone.”\n “You have my heart. That is why I am here. When I am free, I will come to you,” I declared. “Do you not think I am quite overwhelmed by how I feel for you? I hardly know you, but I love you so fiercely it hurts. I am yours, sir. Perhaps not by blood, but my heart, my mind, and what is left of my soul is yours.” My words were vehement and the truth.\n He smiled when I finished, and his kiss enraptured me.\n When we parted, he said, “Then we shall enjoy this time together and not think of unpleasant things. For tonight, we belong only to each other and no other.”\n “Agreed,” I answered him. “Now, what shall we do to celebrate our time?”\n “I can think of many things, but tonight, I desire to take you someplace I know Vlad would never dare take you.”\n “Really? And where would that be?” I was instantly intrigued.\n Ignatius gave me a secretive smile. “Ah, but it is a surprise.”\n I pouted at him. He laughed.\n “Truly, it is best if it is a surprise.”\n Walking together, we passed among the humans still out and about at this late hour. Carriages rattled by while music filtered out into the night through closed doors. The elite of Buda filled the fancy restaurants and concert halls as we slipped easily through the throng.\n We turned down a long narrow side street as Ignatius pressed my hand gently with his. I adored the way his eyes admired me as he drew me closer.\n “I am pleased that you are here with me,” Ignatius said softly, then we turned into a dark alcove set into a wall.\n In the darkest corner was a narrow door that looked quite worn and battered. He knocked upon it and it opened on silent hinges. With a glimmer in his eyes, he stepped into the darkness beyond.\n I was a little taken aback by the dank void that lingered beyond the tiny, narrow battered door, but I trusted him, so I followed.\n I was plunged into icy darkness, then abruptly I was in a brightly lit hallway that glittered with gold. I raised my hand to shield my eyes that were still adjusting to the sudden brilliance.\n Turning about in surprise, I saw a footman closing an enormous gilded door that lead onto the street. It did not resemble in any way the tiny door we had passed through. I knew then that I was in a place of magic and wonder.\n Turning back around, I looked up at the chandelier sparkling with gold and crystal. The walls were decorated in rich scarlet paper with intricate gold designs flowing over it. The carpet beneath my feet was thick and exotic in design.\n Ignatius stood in the candlelight thrown by the chandelier, smiling at me. He reached out his hand and I took it, laughing excitedly. Paintings adorned the walls portraying exotic lands and beautiful people. I spun about on my heel trying to take in the sheer beauty of the hallway, but Ignatius pulled me on.\n A butler greeted us with several maids behind him. The women took our cloaks and disappeared through another door hidden by scarlet curtains.\n “Where are we?”\n Ignatius kissed my forehead. “Purgatory. Or so the proprietor likes to call it.”\n It was then that an amazing creature appeared from behind another set of thick velvet curtains. It moved toward us as if it was gliding, not walking. It was tall, elegant, pale of face and had long, flowing blond hair. I knew instantly it was not human, but it was also not a vampire. It wore a long white gown that was draped artistically on its pale form as if it were some sort of Greek statue.\n And its eyes, its eyes, were like were like flames of fire.\n “Ignatius,” it said in a voice that was neither female nor male.\n “Good evening, Astir,” Ignatius responded with a slight bow of his head.\n “A private dining room, I take it,” the creature said, turning its eerily fiery eyes toward me.\n “Of course.”\n “And who is your companion?”\n Ignatius turned to me and said, “A friend.”\n “And we are discreet,” Astir said with a small smile. It lifted one hand and a butler appeared from behind another red curtain and bowed.\n “Please, follow me,” the newcomer said.\n Astir smiled at me softly, then turned, and I saw two terrible scars on its back, then it was gone with a sweep of its long robe.\n Ignatius took my hand and drew me after him as we stepped beyond the curtain. We traveled down a long hallway, just as opulent as the first, but a bit narrower. Thick curtains covered doorways and the butler guided us to one near the end of the hall. Pressing back the curtain, we stepped into a very elegant, yet small dining room with an exotic round table and two chairs. The walls were dark and the curtains that flowed to the floor beside the ornate fireplace were so dark blue they were almost black.\n “Your private stock,” the butler asked.\n “Yes, please,” Ignatius answered.\n The butler drew out my chair. I sat down and looked to Ignatius curiously. He looked quite serious and a tad mysterious. He took the chair opposite of me and raised his hand to rest his chin upon his knuckles.\n “Where are we?” I asked.\n A waiter entered the room with a tray with two crystal goblets upon it and a bottle with an ornate seal upon it.\n “Purgatory, like I said,” Ignatius answered again. “Or at least Astir calls it that. Astir’s guests call it the Haven, for this is a haven for all things not human.”\n The waiter popped the cork and poured the wine into the goblets. I looked up at him to see if there was anything irregular about him, but he appeared as bland and ordinary as any waiter in a fine restaurant.\n The curtain parted and a lovely young woman stepped into the room dressed in an ornate robe the color of a peacock’s throat. She curtseyed to us, her blond locks falling around her sweet face.\n “Good evening, sir,” she said to Ignatius.\n I admit a bristled a bit at the look in her eye.\n “Good evening,” he answered.\n She proffered her arm and the waiter drew a fine silver dagger and slashed her wrist. I was amazed to see that she barely winced. Tilting her hand she allowed the blood to trickle down her fingers and into our wine goblets.\n I flicked my gaze to Ignatius, arching an eyebrow. He smiled slightly at me over his hand.\n The waiter slipped a white cloth about the girl’s wrist and tied it firmly. After another curtsey, she slipped out of the room. I noticed not one drop of blood had fallen onto the fine tablecloth or the floor.\n The waiter presented both of us with a wine glass, then he also slipped from the room.\n “That girl,” I began.\n “She will be fine. They have potions here that will allow her to heal quickly.”\n “And she is human and knows what we are?”\n Ignatius nodded. “Some humans are willing to serve us in exchange for…pleasures.”\n I frowned at him.\n “No, no, not I. But others perhaps,” he assured me.\n “Well, she certainly adored you,” I said with a little sneer.\n “But I adore you.” He raised his glass to me. “Come now. Do not pout. Let us toast our night together.”\n Feeling a bit peeved, but wishing to please him, I raised my glass.\n “To our love,” Ignatius said simply, tapping my glass with the lip of his.\n “To a lovely night,” I answered, smiling. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-tale-of-the-vampire-bride-vampire-bride-1/page-62.html","bookId":2614,"book":{"id":2614,"title":"The Tale Of The Vampire Bride (Vampire Bride #1)","description":"Storyline: \n The Tale Of The Vampire Bride (Vampire Bride #1) \n Set in the 1820s, The Tale of the Vampire Bride is sure to thrill fans of vampires of literary past with its lush, gothic atmosphere and terrifying spectacle. \n All Lady Glynis Wright ever wanted was the freedom to live life as she pleased, despite her aristocratic parents\u0027 wishes for her to marry into wealth.
