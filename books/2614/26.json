{"id":99631,"no":26,"title":"Page 26","content":"\n 24th of August, 1819\n Tonight was abominable. I do not know how I survived.\n Earlier this evening-\n As I stared pensively out the front window of the Golden Krone Hotel, awaiting the arrival of my lord and Master, Count Vlad Dracula, I sipped burning brandy that did little to soothe my nerves. The letter from Andrew Wright felt heavy in my coat pocket.\n In all my years of serving the Count, I have never borne the brunt of his anger, and I did not anticipate enduring it now. I had seen him unleash his wrath against those who failed him with a brutality that is terrifying. Now, I feared I would fall victim to his anger.\n A thick fog rolled slowly down the street, dark and menacing as it undulated in great waves over the flagstones. I knew this could only mean one thing. The Master had arrived. I took a deep breath as my heart began to race. Black horses waded through the gloom drawing a carriage up to the front entrance of the hotel.\n I set down my drink and hurried to the front door. An employee of the hotel rushed to open the carriage door, and I anxiously followed him. Running a hand over my hair, I tried to steady my nerves and look presentable to the Count. He is, after all, a very particular man.\n The door opened and, instead of descending, the Count’s long, cruel hand slid out of the darkness within the carriage to beckon me. I quickly clambered up into the carriage as the driver began to toss down heavy traveling bags.\n The Count sat comfortably in the darkness, his auburn hair falling to his waist in curls. Dressed impressively in a black evening suit, he stroked his short beard thoughtfully as he regarded my expression. I quickly kissed the large ring on his hand and took the seat across from him.\n “Master, it is good to see you.”\n “My dear friend, you seem worried.” The cold green eyes stood out vividly in the darkness.\n I took a deep breath and quickly found I was unable to continue. I was utterly terrified.\n “Come now. Tell me. What has happened? I can tell by your demeanor that all is not well. Is something amiss in my business dealings?”\n “No, sir, no. It is just that a matter has come to my attention that concerns your plans to move to England.” I reached into my coat pocket and handed the Count the letter I had received from Andrew Wright.\n “What is this?” The Count took the letter, his long nails seeming particularly threatening this night. Count Dracula opened the letter and read it with some interest. I saw his brows knit together and my hands began to tremble. “I thought I told you that no one was to know of the Wright’s visit to my castle.”\n “You did, sir. But my wife was given the letter the day they departed and she did not consult with me. She posted the letter without my knowledge.”\n He frowned at me. “You should have more control over your wife, my friend.”\n I feared for Maria in that moment and gulped down a desperate breath of air. “I should have told her to hand over all the letters to me. I do apologize, sir.”\n He slightly waved his hand at me. “I advise you to make it clear to your beloved wife that you are her master. I will not have her interfering in my plans again.”\n “Yes, sir. I understand, sir. I will make it quite plain to her upon my return home. But, sir, I do not know what to do. I do not know how to respond to his letter.” My words were rushed in a trembling voice. I despised myself for being so afraid, but the Master always instills fear in me.\n The Count sat back in his seat, the leather rustling beneath him, and sighed. “I had confidence in you, Stephen. It is such a shame you have failed me in this one simple request.”\n “I’m terribly sorry, sir. More than I can ever say.”\n “Well, it is of no matter. I think I shall be able to use this situation to my advantage. Yes, yes, it may be a blessing. Perhaps I shall be able to leave for England sooner than I expected.” The Count smiled, his pearl fangs glinting. “Now, get out of my carriage. The night is young, and I wish to enjoy the pleasures of the city.”\n “Of course, sir!” I hurried climbed out. “Shall we speak later, sir?”\n “Yes. Then we can discuss business.” The Count fell back into the shadows of the carriage as the door shut.\n With a sharp order from the driver, the horses trotted on and the carriage of Count Dracula rolled into the foggy night.\n Delighted by my narrow escape, I allowed myself a small sigh of relief before rushing back into the hotel.\n Later, he arrived looking quite rosy of face, his eyes glinting with a keen fever, and I knew he had fed well. We sat together in my hotel room to discuss his business and his demeanor was refreshingly cordial. I sat at a small desk and he sat across from me, tapping the writing paper lightly with one finger.\n “You will write to Andrew Wright and inform him of the most unfortunate event that befell his family in route to my home. There was a terrible storm and their carriage was swept off the road into the river. Only his sister, Glynis, survived, and she is in my care. She has been horribly injured, but I am tending to her medical needs.”\n I wrote down all that he instructed me, my fingers slightly trembling. “You…you did make her…what you are?”\n “Yes, I did.”\n “I do not understand…if she is a vampire, then why not say she is dead as well?”\n “After a time, Glynis will recover, and I will marry her. Or so her brother will think. Then we shall enlist his aid in moving his beloved sister and her husband to England.” The Count smiled wolfishly. “You see, it quite works out.”\n I could see, that yes, he was right.\n As I sink further into his deceit, I find that I am relieved that it is not me who will suffer at the hands of Count Dracula. Tomorrow we travel to Buda to set our plans in motion.\n The Journal of Lady Glynis Wright\n 27th of August, 1819\n I shall try and describe the hell we endured in his absence…\n Our screams have rent the night since we woke in the throes of the hunger. I was the first to run to the great doors and beat upon them with my fists. I heard my sisters rushing behind me and turned.\n Ariana ran dreamily down the long staircase, her long white gown flowing around her like great wings. She looked like an angel and, for a mad moment, I wished she would carry me up to heaven out of this hell.\n Elina threw herself over the railing of the great staircase, her hair fanning around her like a black halo. Cneajna fell to her knees in the center of the grand foyer, screaming. I smashed my fists against the enormous door that led to the outside world.\n The hunger was driving us to insanity.\n Trapped in the castle for days, the gypsies safely locked out, we have been starving. Since Vlad had abruptly left us alone, deliberately chained to this dark corrupt castle by his power, we had not fed. We could not escape to feed and we were on the verge of madness.\n Our bodies and faces had thinned, and we looked strangely inhuman. Our eyes were deep-set, our limbs sinewy. Our hearts had ceased to beat and our bodies became a pale gray. We looked like wraiths. Elina landed beside me and raked her nails feverishly over the darkened wood, splinters tearing into her fingers. We were desperate and beyond reason.\n Ariana ran down the stairs, her hands clutching an ancient sword. Rushing past Cneajna, she raised it over her head, jamming it into the lock.\n “Help me! Help me!”\n I was weeping; the hunger so painful that I felt I was being ripped apart into tiny pieces. Grasping the hilt, I helped Ariana in her attempt to pry open the lock. Elina joined her hands with ours, and together we tried to break open the doors.\n Cneajna huddled on the floor behind us, clawing at her hair in despair. I felt the metal began to bend, and I cried out with relief. “It is opening!”\n Cneajna threw herself at us and grabbed hold of the sword. We were all so very weak. Together we strained as the metal slowly bent and the wood splintered.\n “There! We have done it!” Elina exclaimed, her fingers tugging at the giant latch. The sword clanged to the stone floor. I pulled on the door with all my might and it swung open on rusted hinges.\n “Yes! Yes!” Cneajna gasped in delight.\n The crisp night air fanned over us as we crouched together in the doorway. The invisible barrier erected by Prince Vlad’s dark powers still kept us from racing into the night, but somehow, just seeing the evening sky hovering over the courtyard gave us a measure of solace.\n But the hunger still raged within us.\n “We will starve. If no one comes, we will starve!” Elina collapsed to her knees, clutching the door in anguish.\n Ariana began to wail with fear and hunger.\n I pressed my body against the power holding us captive. I could not break through it. Screaming, I pressed my body against the invisible shield and wept.\n The Journal of Sir Stephen\n 4th of September, 1819\n Count Dracula’s new plans are now set in motion. He seems quite pleased with the situation, and I can only feel a sense of relief. Despite my admiration for the man, I do admit that he frightens me deeply. That he could take our potentially difficult predicament and use it to serve his purposes is a profound reminder that he was once a great Prince of Wallachia.\n After all had been settled in Buda, it was decided that we would travel back to the castle together. I would then continue on alone to see to the sale of one of his properties to finance his newest endeavor. I was not very comfortable traveling such a great length with the Prince, but I fortified myself with the thought of regaining his trust. Throughout our time together, I have noticed him watching me with acute scrutiny. It frightens me terribly. I am determined to sweep away any mistrust he may have in me.\n Leave it to an infernal woman to cause me such despair!\n Count Dracula was surprisingly entertaining during our trip. He recounted many of his great exploits in years past without the usual bitterness he expresses when remembering all the betrayals he suffered as a mortal. I admit his joviality frightened me somewhat. It was so unexpected. I suppose I have become accustomed to his arrogance and his sharpness. To see him smile so widely was rather unnerving.\n Perhaps it is because he is no longer a man, but it always startles me how easily he sits in a swaying and jolting carriage. I sat across from him, holding tightly to the safety straps, fearing for my very life. Yet he sat there, talking to me, gesturing casually, his green eyes glinting at me.\n I am certain he was amused by my white knuckles and terrified expression.\n Then, suddenly, he became quite amused. His disturbing laugh filled the darkness of the carriage as we traveled toward the decaying remains of his once impressive castle.\n “They are really in quite an uproar. Screaming and carrying on.” Count Dracula chuckled as he slapped his gloves against my knee. “Women!”\n I forced a laugh, not certain what he was speaking of.\n “I hear my wives. They are quite upset that I have been gone for so long,” he said.\n “Oh, yes. Your wives! I only have one wife, thank goodness. You have three! How do you stand it? Women can be so insufferable.”\n “Four wives,” the Count said. “Remember, Glynis is now my Bride. And yes, they are all insufferable in their own way.”\n I tried not to look uncomfortable, and nodded. “Oh, yes, Lady Glynis. I was rather surprised that you…changed her. I mean, sir, I know that you said you fancied her, but I thought perhaps the hunting was rather scarce up here and you needed…” I faltered in my words. I always grow nervous when discussing the vampire thirst for blood. Though I have served Count Dracula for more than twelve years now, I am always aware of the possibility of him turning on me.\n Count Dracula flashed his long teeth as he smiled. “My dear friend, the hunting is always good up in the mountains. Especially now that the British Empire has expanded and young English aristocrats are exploring the world. I rather like the English. Their rational minds will not accept what their eyes see. It is rather amusing to hear them screaming that I do not exist.” \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-tale-of-the-vampire-bride-vampire-bride-1/page-26.html","bookId":2614,"book":{"id":2614,"title":"The Tale Of The Vampire Bride (Vampire Bride #1)","description":"Storyline: \n The Tale Of The Vampire Bride (Vampire Bride #1) \n Set in the 1820s, The Tale of the Vampire Bride is sure to thrill fans of vampires of literary past with its lush, gothic atmosphere and terrifying spectacle. \n All Lady Glynis Wright ever wanted was the freedom to live life as she pleased, despite her aristocratic parents\u0027 wishes for her to marry into wealth.
