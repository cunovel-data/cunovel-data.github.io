{"id":14034,"no":48,"title":"CHAPTER XXXV","content":"Charles left his hoe in the barn and started toward the front of the house. Was he mistaken, or did he see a group of three men near the steps? Yes, and Rowland was one of them. As he passed through the gate he noted the big revolvers belted around the waists of the strangers. They were strong, well-built, sturdy men of the mountains in broad-brimmed felt hats. They evidently saw him, eyed him steadily as he came up the walk, and stood aside silently as he fearlessly ascended the steps. He thought they were going to arrest him, had no sense of objection to it, and was surprised when they neither spoke nor moved. As for Rowland, he simply nodded coldly and Charles went on up to his room. \\n\\n \\n\\n He went to a window. It was open and he heard the mumbled voices of the men below, but could not see them. He stood listening. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, it is all right, Colonel,\" one of the men said. \"You\u0027ve done all you can do. The sheriff thinks the thing looks shaky, and he wants to be on the safe side. There is a big reward out for those chaps and he thinks the fellow that was so free with his money in Tobe Keith\u0027s case, and your man that was with him at the time, are two of them.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ve heard all that from the sheriff himself,\" Rowland answered. \"You may think it strange of us, but we are all willing to trust Mr. Brown. He has done good work here, and has been more than a friend.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But you say yourself, Colonel, that you don\u0027t know a thing about him,\" came the answer. \"You don\u0027t know where he comes from, what his connections are, or anything.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s all true,\" Rowland admitted, wearily. \"I\u0027ve never believed in prying into the private affairs of people. He is doing for us more than he agreed to do, and I am sure he is an educated gentleman who may have met with misfortune of some sort. I\u0027ve never thought he was a happy man, and I\u0027ve been sorry for him. I wish I could befriend him; and if you will give me a chance—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Charles listened no longer. He had made up his mind as to what he would do. Turning, he went deliberately down-stairs and out to the group. They looked at him in surprise as he approached, and appeared to be somewhat abashed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Gentlemen,\" Charles began, calmly, \"pardon me for interrupting your conversation, but I have reason to believe that you are here on my account. Am I right?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, yes,\" one of the men said, awkwardly, as he shifted from one of his heavily booted feet to the other. \"You see, we are deputies under the sheriff\u0027s orders.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I thought so,\" Charles answered, \"and I\u0027ve come to ask a favor of you. The fact that you are watching me under this gentleman\u0027s roof is very mortifying to me, for I respect his kindness and his hospitality, and I want to ask if there is any reason why you may not arrest me and take me elsewhere?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The question astounded them. The two men exchanged swift glances of inquiry. \"Why—why, we have had no such orders, you see,\" the deputy stammered. \"We are only doing as we were directed.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But a man has a right to decent treatment before he is proved guilty of a charge,\" Charles went on, \"and this constant shadowing of this house because I am here is not fair to me or the family. I am a laborer on this place—that and nothing more—and I demand that you either withdraw from these premises or take me with you for safekeeping.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Charles heard a gasp behind him, and saw Mary standing in the doorway, pale as death and trembling. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What are you saying?\" she cried, and she came forward and caught the arm of her lover. \"You are not going! You are not!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Daughter! Daughter!\" Rowland protested, in a sinking voice, \"be careful—be careful! Daughter, be careful!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He is not going!\" she repeated. \"It is a shame, an outrage! Father, if he goes, I go. Understand that for once and all.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n An awkward pause ensued. Charles stood like a man of granite, his head up, his eyes fixed on the deputies; across his face the whip of pain had left its mark. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We have no orders,\" said the man who had spoken before, \"except to hang around here and see if that friend of yours comes back, or any other suspicious stranger. We can\u0027t take you till we have orders, and we can\u0027t let up on our guard, either. There are four of us—two for night, and two for day work.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Rowland looked at his daughter wistfully. There was a suggestion of slow rising emotion in his wrinkled face as he spoke. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Tell Sheriff Frazier for me, boys, that I will furnish a bond for any amount in Mr. Brown\u0027s behalf, and that I hope he will do what Mr. Brown wishes in regard to lifting this—this surveillance.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mr. Rowland,\" Charles cried out, urgently, \"you mustn\u0027t do that. I don\u0027t deserve it at your hands. I\u0027m a stranger without a dollar to my name.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He does deserve it, father. You are right,\" said Mary, as she swept to her father\u0027s side and locked her arm in his. \"He is the best and truest friend we ever had, and you will never regret this.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The old white head rocked up and down deliberately. \"Yes, tell the sheriff what I said, and do it at once if possible.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"One of us will see him right away,\" was the deputy\u0027s answer, as both of them clattered down the steps and strode toward the gate. \\n\\n \\n\\n Charles started forward as if to utter a further protest, but Mary sprang to his side. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hush!\" she cried. \"Father wants to do this. Let him! It is a poor enough return for what you have done for us.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Turning suddenly, as if to hide her emotion, she went into the house. Rowland and Charles stood facing each other in the gathering dusk. From the direction of the kitchen came the singing voices of Kenneth and Martin, who were unconscious of the tragedy being enacted so close at hand. There was a light rising into the old face of the planter which Charles had never seen there before. Rowland laid his hand on his shoulder and let it lie there gently, almost tenderly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You have won the heart of my daughter,\" he began. \"She is the image of her mother, and the man who has such a love has all the world can give that is worth having. I congratulate you, sir. For her sake I must make your cause my own. You have helped me free my sons; you must help me save my daughter. She could not survive your downfall—I know that because I knew her mother. Tell me, as a man facing a man, are these charges true?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They are not. I swear they are not.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Thank God! That is all I want to know!\" Rowland held out his hand and, taking that of Charles, he pressed it tightly. He was about to withdraw in his stately way when Charles drew him back. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Wait,\" he faltered. \"As I\u0027ve said, these charges are wholly unfounded, but under the circumstances it is my duty to you to tell you what your daughter has failed to mention, and that is that there are things in my life which I have pledged my honor never to reveal—things concerning others more than myself—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then don\u0027t mention them,\" Rowland said, firmly. \"Do your duty as you see it and God will take care of you. I have suspected that you may be keeping back something, but that is your right. Now let\u0027s go in to supper. But wait a moment. I want to speak of something psychological. Do you know that a man of my age can be turned from almost a lifelong purpose in an instant? You have seen me working on that ponderous genealogy of mine. Well, the other day when my boys were in so much danger my daughter and I were alone in my room. She looked very sad, and all at once it seemed to me that she was an exact reproduction of her mother when we were married. You know in that day when I brought my young wife here we had everything our hearts desired in the way of luxury, comfort, and even what was then considered style. Now it is all gone and we are poor. This change, I reckon, has pained me more than it has my daughter, and I have clung to the past and tried to keep it alive. One of the ways of keeping it alive has been my thinking and writing about the dignity and superiority of my ancestors. I was getting my book ready to hand down to my children and their children, and I would have finished it and published it but for my daughter. On the day I spoke of just now, I happened to tell her that I was thinking of borrowing some money to pay for the printing, when I saw from her face that she wasn\u0027t pleased. I asked her what was the matter, and she came and sat on my knee, sir, as she had done as a little child, and as—as her mother had done as a bride. She put her arm around my neck and kissed me, and then she begged my forgiveness for saying what she felt that she ought to say. She pointed out that she and her brothers belonged to a different age from the one I\u0027d passed through. As she saw it, life was too grim and serious for one to foster pride in one\u0027s ancestors simply because they, being men and women of gentility, wealth, and influence, had stood higher than others. Mary cried as she begged that I should not spend any money to publish a book which she herself could not take pride in. She said that sorrow, trouble, and adversity had made her see that the common people were nearer God than the opposite class, and that if we expected God to help us out of the great trouble in which my sons were plunged we must humble ourselves. Well, sir, I was changed—in a flash I was a changed man. My young daughter had taught me more in a moment than I had learned in a long lifetime. I laid the manuscript away. If it has any historical value it may be used by some one else in the future, but not by me. It is full of human vanity. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I felt as if a vast load had been somehow lifted from my old shoulders. I knew she was right and obeyed her. I am telling you this, sir, because you have a right to know the kind of woman whose heart you have won. She is a treasure, sir—a treasure—a treasure!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Aunt Zilla was ringing the supper-bell. Its tones swept melodiously over the dusk-draped fields. The old man had taken the arm of his companion as he might that of an honored guest in the past, and led him into the house. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I shall never question your integrity, sir,\" he said. \"Something has told me all along that you are a man among men. My daughter has felt it intuitively, and so have I and my sons. Whatever your personal trouble is, we\u0027ll stick to you through it if you will only give us a chance.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Charles found himself unable properly to respond. The family were at the table in the shaded lamplight. The meal passed in quiet dignity, and when it was over the men went out to the front veranda. Kenneth and Martin, who had not been informed of the talk with the deputies, were still in a gay mood and began singing again. Rowland stood on the steps for a moment, and then walked down toward the gate. Finding himself alone, Charles slipped up to his room. He had an overwhelming sense of his need of quiet reflection. He sat down, lighted his pipe, but in his inactive hands it quickly expired. That he would have to face the officers of the law sooner or later he did not doubt. The bond in his favor might mean a few days\u0027 delay, but it also meant the certainty of his appearance before the authorities. What would then take place he could not imagine, but of one thing he was sure—a stranger in a strange land who flatly refused to give account of himself when charged with an offense against the law would find himself in a serious position indeed. Then a sudden thought hurtled through his brain and shook him from head to foot, leaving him cold with sheer despair. Why had he not thought of it before? The account of his arrest would be given in the papers, along with the name he had never changed. It would be copied all over the country, and the Charles Browne of Boston, so long sought, would be discovered at last. William would read his doom in the head-lines of his paper at his desk or the breakfast-table. Celeste would know the truth, for William would tell the truth rather than see his brother unjustly punished. The revolver—ah yes! the revolver in the drawer of his brother\u0027s desk! It was as clear to his sight now as when he had last seen it. William would use it, without doubt, now, and there would be no delay. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Where is Mr. Brown?\" It was Mary\u0027s voice addressed to her brothers below. Charles sprang up and stood listening. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I think he went up-stairs,\" Martin said. \"He may be tired. He has worked hard to-day.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Tired!\" repeated the grim listener, with a sardonic smile, as if the body counted when the soul of a man was being hounded to such a sinister doom. Mary was still on the veranda. What good could be done by his going to her? How could he act with her as if nothing new had happened when the claws of this unexpected monster were clutching his throat? He crept with the tread of a thief out into the hall and looked down the stairs. He could see Mary standing in the doorway. What was she thinking? How would she view the thing he now feared? He went back into his room and strode to and fro across the uncarpeted floor, his arms locked, his jaws clenched. Presently he heard the sound of hoofs and some one dismounted at the gate and strode up the walk to the steps. Charles went to a window. A restive horse was pawing at the gate. The voice of one of the deputies came up from below: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I happened to meet the sheriff over at Dodd\u0027s, Colonel. He said the bond would be all right, and he has ordered us away. Your man will have to appear in a few days, and you will be informed. He said to tell you that the bond would be drawed up for a thousand dollars and that the fellow would not be arrested yet a while. He said for me to say that you was taking a big risk, as he has fresh reasons for thinking that your man will never be able to show a clean record. He thinks if he had been able to do so he would have put it up before this, considering all that\u0027s happened.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Charles started to the stairs, but suddenly checked himself. What was there to say or do? And time to think and try to plan was what he needed. He went back to his room and sat down. He was aflame with the terrible shame of the thing. He heard Mary\u0027s subdued voice in conversation with her father and brothers, and the hoof-beats of the deputy\u0027s horse as he rode away toward the village. How could he face his friends down there with sealed lips when they were so valiantly and faithfully defending him out of sheer confidence in his veiled integrity? He decided that he would not join them. He sat in his unlighted room till he heard them saying good night to one another, and then he went to bed, but not to sleep. Through the long, warm night he struggled with his problem. Once he half thought he had solved it. He might now manage to escape. It would be leaving Rowland with the bond to pay, but he could perhaps get to William safely, secure the money, and return it. But could it be done? No, for the names of Charles Brown of Georgia and Charles Browne of Boston would be linked together by the detectives, published everywhere, and a renewed search for the bank defaulter would meet with success. No, there was nothing to do now but to wait—if a man of his temperament could wait with a sword like that hanging over him and all he loved. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2360/65914.html","bookId":416,"book":{"id":416,"title":"The Hills of Refuge","description":"简介： The house, a three-story red-brick residence, was on Walnut Street, near Beacon.
