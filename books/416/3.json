{"id":13989,"no":3,"title":"CHAPTER III","content":"He threw himself on his bed. He was lying with his dull stare on the white ceiling when he heard the voices of his sister-in-law and her child in the hall below. The front door opened. They were going out—out into the open air with free consciences, he told himself, with a pang of fresh pain. He stifled a groan with the end of a pillow into which he had turned his face. Then he sat up to listen. It was a step on the stair—a step he had known from childhood. It was that of his brother William. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He is coming! He is coming up here,\" Charles muttered, aghast. \"Well, it is his right. He waited till the others went out so that he can rave and storm to his heart\u0027s content. Yes, he is coming. He has heard about the club, and all the rest. This time he will kick me out. He has stood me long enough, in God\u0027s name.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Charles sat erect and adjusted his dressing-gown with nervous hands. The step was now near. The top of the flight of stairs was almost reached. Charles stood up as a gentle rap was sounded on the door. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Come in,\" he called out, his husky voice cracking in his parched throat. The door was slowly opened and William Browne, pale, haggard, and trembling nervously, entered. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sit down, old man,\" Charles said, indicating a chair. \"Sit down. I thought you\u0027d come.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Thank you.\" The movement toward the chair conveyed an idea of almost helpless groping. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I am sorry I wasn\u0027t fit to come down,\" Charles faltered. \"I don\u0027t show your house much respect, Billy, but at least I can hide myself when I have sense enough left.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The banker groaned as he sank into the chair and sat staring at the floor. His brother took another chair close to the table. He lowered his tangled head to the table and waited. But no further sound came from his companion. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, I\u0027ve hit him hard—I\u0027ve hit him hard this time!\" Charles thought to himself. \"He has lost all hope of me now. It is hard for him to say what he has to say, but he is going to say it. He looks like Uncle James now, with those grim lines about his mouth. Poor Billy! he deserves a better deal from me, for God knows he has been a good brother. No one else would have borne with me as he has all these years. But he has reached his limit. His endurance is ended. In the first place, I must leave the bank. Yes, that is first—then, then, yes, I must leave this house. He will say I have turned it into a hog-pen. He is calm. God! how calm he is! He is choosing his words. He has determined to speak gently. I can see that.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Lessie and Ruth have gone out,\" William presently said, without raising his eyes. \"Michael said you were here, and I took this opportunity to—to—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I know; I expected you,\" Charles heard his own voice as from a great distance, so faint was his utterance. He cleared his throat. \"Yes, I knew you\u0027d come. There was nothing else for you to do.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n William\u0027s head rocked to and fro despondently. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think you know why I\u0027ve come,\" he said, grimly, and he raised his all but bloodshot eyes and fixed them on his brother\u0027s lowered head. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh yes, you have heard of this last debauch of mine, and the damnable acts that went with it—my expulsion from the club, the trial at the police court, along with other common loafers, and—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I hardly know whether I heard of them or not,\" William said, his stare now on his brother\u0027s face. \"You speak of yourself. What about me? My God! Charlie, what about me?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, I know that you\u0027ve gone the limit.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Gone the limit? Then you know,\" William broke in, his lower lip hanging helplessly from his gleaming teeth. \"You know about me—but how could you know? It is my own private matter, and—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I know that your patience is exhausted, Billy. I know that you are sensible enough to see that I am no fit occupant of your house. Your wife is a sensitive, delicate woman. Your child is—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, that is what you think I mean!\" William broke in. \"Great God! you think that I am worried about that! Listen to me, Charlie. You sit there accusing yourself, perhaps feeling that you have committed unpardonable sins, but look straight at me. As God is my judge, I\u0027d be the happiest man alive if I could exchange places with you this morning. You have done this, and you have done that, but you have been honest—honest—honest—honest! I\u0027ve seen you tried. I\u0027ve seen you need money badly, but you have never touched a penny that was not your own. Charlie, I am a thief!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Charles straightened up in his chair. He laid his slender hand with the long fingers and curving nails on the table and stared, as if bewildered by what he had heard. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know what you mean, Billy,\" he said, slowly shaking his head. \"You can\u0027t be in earnest.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But I am,\" the banker groaned. \"I have wanted to tell you for a week past, and I would have done so if you hadn\u0027t begun to drink again. Do you remember when I came to your desk Friday afternoon? I wanted then to ask you into my office, but I saw you had been drinking, and I knew that you\u0027d not understand. I\u0027ve taken money from the vaults, Charlie. I\u0027m short sixty thousand dollars, and there is no chance now to avoid detection.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n It was as if the declaration had completely sobered the younger man. He rose to his feet, towering above the shrunken form in the chair. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You can\u0027t mean that seriously,\" he faltered, his drink-flushed face paling. \"Oh, you can\u0027t, Billy!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But I do. My transactions have been secret; through a broker in New York I bought copper on a margin. It kept going against me till all my funds and available collateral were used up. I was sure it would win. All hell told me it would win. I couldn\u0027t stand the disgrace of failure. It meant losing my position, too. I struggled with it all one night in the bank, and the next morning, when the time-lock opened the vaults, I took the money and, with it in my pocket, I went to New York and put it up.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You did? You did? My God! Billy, and lost it!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Within twenty-four hours. Charlie, you have been a drunkard, but your soul has remained clean. But I\u0027m lost—I\u0027m lost. I\u0027ll be sent to jail. My wife will shrink in shame from the public gaze. My child will grow up to see that I have set her, by my own act, into a despised class. Great God! that little trusting thing will have to bear my just punishment! So—so you thought I\u0027d come here to reproach you, eh? You say you have been turned out of a club. I am being turned into a prison. Charlie, I was a coward when I took that money. I am a coward now, and I cannot face this thing. You must not object to what I have to do. It is dishonorable, but it is more honorable than the other.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You don\u0027t mean—you can\u0027t mean—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There is nothing else to do, Charlie. Don\u0027t you see that in this way it will be all over at once? Think of the arrest, the long trial, the certain conviction, the parting, the stripes, the clipped hair! No, no, you must not oppose me. Ruth will forget me then, but, alive and in jail, I\u0027d be a canker on her young soul. Lessie could marry again. God knows I\u0027d want her to do so. Yes, it is the only way out, Charlie.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The drunkard seemed a drunkard no longer. He might have been an impassioned young priest full of a holy desire to comfort as he stood before the wilted man and clasped his hands. He knelt at his brother\u0027s knees, he caught the tense fingers in his. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You shall not kill yourself!\" he cried. \"God will show you a way to avoid it. I feel it within me. There must be a way—there must!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There is no other way!\" William groaned. \"I\u0027ve thought of everything under heaven till I\u0027m crazed with it all.\" He stood up. He put his limp arm about the shoulders of his brother. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Will it be known at once? Do the directors suspect?\" Charles asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not yet, but you know the bank examiner will be here Thursday. It can\u0027t be kept from him. If I were unmolested for three months I could replace the money. I\u0027m sure more than that amount will come out of the Western mining lands I hold. The sale is made, and only a legal technicality holds back the final settlement.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ah, then if you confessed the truth to the directors, and promised to replace the money, would they—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They would send me to jail, just the same,\" William answered. \"They are that sort, every man of them. In their eyes a man who will steal once will steal again, and they may be right—they may be right.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Nevertheless, you must not think of—the—the other thing, Billy. For God\u0027s sake, don\u0027t!\" Charles pleaded. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What else can I do?\" William swayed in his brother\u0027s embrace and turned toward the door. Charles released him, and stood speechless in sheer helplessness as his brother stalked to the door, opened it, and went slowly down the stairs. \\n\\n \\n\\n Left alone, the younger man turned to a window and stood staring blankly out into the sunshine. Presently he went to the bureau, opened a drawer, and took out the flask of whisky. Taking a glass, he poured some of the fluid out and then stood staring at it in surprise. A strange thing had happened. It was like a miracle, and yet psychologists have said that it belongs to the regular order of nature. Charles was conscious of no desire for the drink before him; in fact, he was averse to it. He was under the sway of a high spiritual emotion, which the thing in his hand seemed vaguely to oppose. He marveled over the change in himself as he held the glass up to the light. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m asking poor Billy to be a man,\" he said, \"while I am less than one myself. Strange! strange!\" he muttered, wonderingly, \"but I feel as if I shall never drink again—never, never!\" With a hand that was quite steady he took the glass to the window and emptied its contents on the grass in the little plot below. Then he began to shave himself, and after that was done he dressed himself carefully. \\n\\n \\n\\n The church-bells were ringing. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, I must save him—I must save them all!\" he kept saying. \"Something must be done. But what?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2360/65869.html","bookId":416,"book":{"id":416,"title":"The Hills of Refuge","description":"简介： The house, a three-story red-brick residence, was on Walnut Street, near Beacon.
