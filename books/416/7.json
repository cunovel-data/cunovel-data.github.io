{"id":13993,"no":7,"title":"CHAPTER VII","content":"Reclining on the two benches, Charles managed to fall asleep, and in spite of his worries he slept soundly. The gray morning light crept in at the open window and swept his dust-coated face, but still he did not wake. The light grew yellow and warm as the sun rose, but still he slept. He waked and sat up as the train was entering the suburbs of New York. \n \n \"Safe—still safe!\" was his first thought, as he looked about him. The car was now half-full of passengers, many of them commuters going in to work. How fresh, clean, and contented they looked with their cigars and damp papers, and what a dismal tramp was he, at least in his own eyes! There was a little lavatory at the end of the car, and his first impulse was to go to it, wash the dust from his face and hands, and brush off his clothing; then it occurred to him that, as he was, he was less recognizable than otherwise, and he gave up the idea. \n \n Slowly the long train clattered over the switches and crossings and pulled into the station at Forty-second Street. The vast roof cut off the direct rays of the sun and the forms and faces of the passengers became indistinct in the shadow. He followed the others down the packed aisle and joined the stream of passengers on the platform, all forging their way to the street. Covertly, as he hurried along, holding his bag in his right hand, he watched the crowd of bystanders to see if any one wore a police uniform. He was gratified to notice that the way seemed clear in that respect. And then he smiled at his imagined fears, for how could the police be on his track before the opening of the bank? No, no, he was safe so far, and he would soon be hidden from sight in the slums of the great city, for it was the slums that were to shelter him. There no one would look for a man of his type. \n \n He was soon out in the crowded thoroughfare. Somehow it appealed to him to-day more than ever before. He walked along the street until he reached Fifth Avenue, and then he realized that he was not going in the direction he desired and turned back. He walked on till the buildings began to look more antiquated and shabby, and then he turned south. He pursued this direction till he had reached Twenty-eighth Street, and then turned east again. The surroundings were now decidedly squalid. The street was unclean and thronged. The houses were old three-story-and-basement residences, the ground floors of many having been turned into shops, the upper floors being rented as sleeping quarters at a very low rate as was shown by the soiled cards placed against the window-panes to catch the eye of passers-by. \n \n Suddenly he became aware that he was hungry, and he looked about him for a place to break his fast, for he had eaten scarcely anything since noon the day before. Presently he descried a restaurant. It was located on the first floor immediately above a delicatessen shop. The street in front of it was unclean, ash-cans and garbage-pails flanking the crumbling brownstone steps to the entrance; and yet his aversion to these unsavory surroundings was conquered by his hunger and the security that such a place afforded him. \n \n He went in and was surprised at the inviting appearance of the room. It was clean. The walls were snow white. White-clothed tables stood close together, some small, some long and narrow. He put down his bag and hung his hat and overcoat on an upright rack. The tables were nearly all filled with a motley assortment of human beings. The table near his bag had a single occupant, a young man of about his own age. Charles sat down opposite him. The fellow\u0027s face appealed to him vaguely, as reminding him of some countenance he had once seen and forgotten. It was a rather round face, blue-eyed, clean shaved, and crowned by light-brown curly hair. \n \n A waitress in spotless apron and cap came to Charles. \"You forgot to get your check,\" she said. \n \n \"Check? What is that?\" he asked. \n \n \"Oh, I\u0027ll get it for you,\" the girl said, hurriedly, and she went to the glass-inclosed desk by the door at which another girl sat. \n \n The stranger across the table held up his own check and smiled. \"It\u0027s like this,\" he explained. \"You see the prices, from five cents up to one dollar, are printed on it. The girl who waits on you punches the amount you order, and that is what you pay as you turn the check over at the desk when you go out.\" \n \n \"Oh, I see! Thank you!\" Charles liked the face more than ever. Its underlying humor and good nature at once soothed and attracted him. The waitress came back with the check, and with it brought a printed bill of fare which she gave to Charles. While he was looking it over she bent near the man across the table. \n \n \"You can\u0027t keep this up,\" she said, gently. \"It will kill you. I\u0027ve been watching you for a week.\" \n \n \"Oh, leave that to me,\" he answered, with a smile that Charles now saw was drawn and twisted by manly embarrassment. \"I\u0027ve been this way before and pulled through.\" \n \n The waitress sighed. \"I wish I could manage it,\" she said in an undertone, \"but I can\u0027t. That woman at the desk is a cat. She has it in for me.\" \n \n \"You don\u0027t think I\u0027d let you do anything like that for me, I hope,\" he said, sensitively. \"I appreciate it very much, but no working-girl shall lose through me.\" \n \n Without replying she came around and bent over Charles. \"Ready to order?\" she asked. \n \n \"Eggs and bacon and coffee with cream,\" he said. As he spoke he noticed that his table companion had apparently ordered nothing but the few slices of bread and butter which he was slowly eating. A goblet of water was all the man had to drink. Charles now understood the situation and he wanted to assist, but Boston men of his class are not as free with strangers as Western and Southern people, and he found himself unable tactfully to accomplish what he desired. \n \n \"You are not quite on to the ropes,\" the stranger remarked, his eyes on the dress-suitcase which Charles had put down. \"It was all new to me when I came here, but it doesn\u0027t take long to get the run of things. God knows it is simple enough if you have the money to do it with.\" \n \n \"I suppose so,\" Charles responded. \"I\u0027ve just come in.\" \n \n The waitress was bringing his breakfast. She placed it before him, handing him a paper napkin and leaving spoons and knife and fork. \"Anything else?\" she asked. \n \n \"Nothing now, thank you,\" Charles answered. \n \n Instead of going on to the next table at which a man and a woman with drink-flushed faces were seating themselves amid the soiled dishes left by others, she leaned again over the shoulder of the young man opposite Charles. \n \n \"You must let me help,\" she whispered. \"I know you are all right, and you will never get work if you are underfed. You see, I know because I\u0027ve been there myself.\" \n \n \"Please, please, don\u0027t mention it,\" the young man said, his face drawn and flushed with chagrin. \"I assure you I am all right. That\u0027s a good girl—let it drop.\" \n \n She said nothing, but moved on to the new arrivals and began to place the soiled things onto a tray preparatory to taking their order. \n \n \"Do you intend to stop in the city awhile?\" the young man asked Charles. \n \n \"I may,\" the Bostonian returned. \"I am looking for a room in this neighborhood.\" \n \n \"Oh, there are plenty of them,\" the other smiled, \"but you don\u0027t always run across clean ones. I\u0027ve tried several places and left. The house where I am now is clean and cheap, and I think there are plenty of vacancies. I have the landlady\u0027s card, if you care to look her up.\" \n \n \"Thank you, I\u0027d like to do so.\" Charles had the feeling that he would like to see more of the stranger, and living in the same house might afford him the opportunity. The young man took a card from his pocket, and as he got up he laid it before Charles. \"I hope you will find a room you like,\" he said, wearily, as he reached up for his hat, which Charles noticed was dented and frayed on the edges of the brim. As he went out Charles watched him, and saw him push a five-cent piece across the desk to the cashier. He looked very thin and his step seemed uncertain, like that of a convalescent. \n \n The waitress came back to Charles. \"He is in bad shape,\" she sighed. \"He has been coming here for two weeks and eating like that. He is silly. He won\u0027t take help from any one. He has been well brought up, I\u0027ll bet.\" \n \n \"I wanted to help him, but I didn\u0027t see an opening for it,\" Charles said. \"It was kind of you to offer it.\" \n \n \"Oh, I\u0027d break if I owned this joint,\" she laughed. \"I see things like that every day. Our cook used to make pancakes in the window. It was pitiful to see the people stand watching him with their poor mouths open.\" \n \n Her voice shook and she suddenly turned away. As he was leaving the restaurant a wonderful sense of peace and quiet was on him. Already his new life was full of attractive novelty. How could he account for it logically? He was a fugitive from law, without any income to provide for his needs; he had renounced every tie of blood and former associate; he was a man without a home, without a prop to lean upon, and yet an inexpressible content was his. Was it due to his disgust over his past life and the sense of having put it behind him, or was it on account of the sacrifice he had made for his brother? He could not have said. \n \n Glancing at the card, he saw that the rooming-house was quite near, and he turned toward it. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2360/65873.html","bookId":416,"book":{"id":416,"title":"The Hills of Refuge","description":"简介： The house, a three-story red-brick residence, was on Walnut Street, near Beacon.
