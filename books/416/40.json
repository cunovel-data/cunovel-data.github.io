He thought he heard Mary uttering a startled command of some sort; and then there were steps on the stairway and Kenneth and Martin softly knocked on his door. He opened it. \n \n \"Some one is driving up the road,\" Kenneth explained. \"Sister thought it might be Albert Frazier coming to call on her. Anyway, she said, as he doesn\u0027t know that we are at home, we\u0027d better keep out of sight. He may want to stay all night, and in that case we\u0027ll have to go to the barn again.\" \n \n The three men went to a window and cautiously looked out. A horse and buggy were stopping at the gate. Frazier was alighting, while Rowland went down the walk to meet him in accordance with his hospitable habit. \n \n \"I can\u0027t stop long,\" Frazier was heard saying. \"Leave the horse there. He\u0027ll stand, all right. I only want to see your daughter a few minutes.\" \n \n \"Thank God!\" Kenneth exclaimed, in relief. \"Then we can get to bed, Martin. Oh, how I hate that man!\" \n \n The boys left Charles alone. He heard them creeping down the hall to their room at the end of the house. Later he heard their father pass on his way to his room. Charles sat down on his bed again. A different mood was now on him. Hot fury raged through him as he thought of what might be taking place below. That man might be urging the gentle girl to marry him. He might still be holding threats over her, and Mary might accept him. He heard their low voices. Frazier\u0027s dominated. Its coarse monotone rumbled through the hall. He seemed to be explaining something. Charles closed his ears, for the sound was maddening. \n \n \"It is rather late to call,\" Frazier was saying, \"but I had to see you, and this was the only time. I\u0027ve thought it all over about me and you, little girl. I don\u0027t know, but maybe I\u0027m not as tough a proposition as I appear to be. The truth is, I\u0027m all in. I\u0027ve lost every cent of money I had. I plunged too reckless. I lived too high. It was come-easy-go-easy with me. I\u0027ve been a bad man, but you were always what I wanted. I reckon it is because you are so good at heart, but I knew that you\u0027d never love me. I knew that, and so I resorted to that other game. I am sorry, for it was a sneaking thing to do. But, as I say, I\u0027m all in financially. I could not maybe for many years give you what you deserve, and so I\u0027ve decided to tell you about it and move away from here. I have a chance of getting something to do in Seattle. My mother\u0027s brother has an opening for me there and I am going at once. You never cared for me, did you, little girl? Now be honest.\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t think I ever loved you,\" Mary responded. \"It was because you were so—so kind to me and father and the boys—that—\" \n \n \"Oh, I know. That was part of my dirty work,\" Frazier sighed. \"I was looking a long way ahead. Your father is as simple as a child, and I was using him, tempting him to let me indorse for him. However, he owes me nothing now. I am a bankrupt and the bank that advanced the money to him with my security will look to him for it. Your crops are good this year, and he will be able to make a substantial payment on account when they are marketed. That man you picked up is a wonder. My brother thinks there is something crooked about him and is looking him up. The fellow acts strangely, but he is doing your place no harm, and perhaps you ought to keep him. There is some mystery about him, but I\u0027ve seen others like him who turned out all right in the end. I think he has secret associates. In fact, I have an idea that some friend of his advanced the money for Tobe Keith\u0027s operation. I started to make investigations on that line, but my crash came, and all that is off.\" \n \n \"Do you think Tobe\u0027s chance is good to recover?\" Mary asked, falteringly. \n \n \"That is one thing I came to tell you,\" Frazier answered. \"The latest news is even more favorable. I heard this afternoon from Doctor Harrison that he is doing splendidly.\" \n \n \"Oh, I\u0027m so glad!\" Mary cried. \"You can\u0027t imagine how much it means to me!\" \n \n \"I think I can, little girl, for you are a mother to the boys, young as you are. I came to say something else, too. I wanted to wipe my slate off as clean as possible before I go, and so I set to work on my brother. He now knows all about how I felt to you, and, as he is a good fellow, he promised to help all he could. He is sure now that the boys will never be seriously punished and has promised me not to arrest them.\" \n \n \"Does he know that they did not go West, after all?\" Mary asked, anxiously. \n \n \"Yes, he does now. The boys were seen working in the field by a mischievous neighbor, who reported it, but no harm will come of it now. You can depend on my brother. He will not molest them. They\u0027ve had their lesson. They never were a bad sort, but only a little wild. They have good blood in them and will come out all right in the end. My brother really hates to have me leave, and he will stand behind any friend of mine. I\u0027m a rotten egg, little girl. Wanting to tie to you was my best point, and that was a doubtful one, for I was unworthy of you, and knew it all along—all along. I reckon a man ought to be as clean as the woman he marries, and I was wrong, too, in trying to get you by the methods I was using.\" \n \n The horse at the gate was pawing the ground impatiently. Frazier looked over the landscape musingly. The moon was just appearing above a mountain-top. The old house which had blazed with the festive light and rung with the merriment of buried generations stood swathed in darkness, its roof-edge drawing a line against the dun sky. Ghosts of the past, earth-anchored by sweet memories, perchance, came and went through the old doorway and strolled about the moonlit grounds. \n \n \"It is time I was going,\" Frazier announced. \"I don\u0027t know what has come over me of late, little girl, but I know that I am different from what I used to be. If I hadn\u0027t been I\u0027d never have said what I\u0027ve said to-night. I hope you will be happy. You\u0027d never have been so with me—never! Good-by!\" \n \n \"Good-by!\" she echoed. She was crying. Why? She couldn\u0027t have answered. She went with him to the gate. She held his arm in a gentle grasp of pitying gratitude. They shook hands over the gate. He took up the reins, got into the buggy with his old ponderous movement, raised his hat, and the impatient horse bore him away. \n \n She turned and glanced up at the window of Charles\u0027s room. He was standing there, looking at her, but she could not see him through the murky panes. \n \n \"Now go to bed, darling,\" a voice from the past whispered in her subconscious ear, \"Mother is watching over you.\" \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2360/65906.html","bookId":416,"book":{"id":416,"title":"The Hills of Refuge","description":"简介： The house, a three-story red-brick residence, was on Walnut Street, near Beacon.
