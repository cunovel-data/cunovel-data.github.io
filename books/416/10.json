{"id":13996,"no":10,"title":"CHAPTER X","content":"Alone in his little room, Charles became conscious of a vast sense of fatigue, induced, no doubt, by the fact that his fears concerning his brother\u0027s fate were now allayed. Removing his coat and shoes, he threw himself on the hard, narrow bed and was soon soundly asleep. He did not awaken till three o\u0027clock in the afternoon, and might have slept longer but for the harsh sound of a truck delivering coal through a sheet-iron chute into the basement of a house next door. He lay for several minutes trying to recall some vaguely delectable and flitting dreams he had just been enjoying. Somehow, by sheer contrast to their evanescent quality, the sordid little room and its meager furnishings produced a depression that had not come to him since the beginning of his flight. His thoughts were on his home, and he was all but faint under the sharp realization that it was his home no longer. \\n\\n \\n\\n Presently he heard a step on the stairs. It was a slow, discouraged one, and the man who made it opened the room adjoining his and went in, leaving the door open. Feeling the need of fresh air, Charles got up and opened his own door. And as he did so he saw the inmate of the other room standing over the open trunk. To his surprise he recognized him as the man whose acquaintance he had made at the restaurant. Their eyes met. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I see you got fixed,\" the stranger said, with a smile that seemed forced. \"Well, you will like it, all right, I think. As for me, I\u0027m bounced. I\u0027ve had my walking-papers. Mrs. Reilly is a good soul, but she has to live, and I don\u0027t blame her. Do you know, she was awfully good about it—tried to let me down easy, says I can take my trunk and all that, and forget what I owe her. Take my trunk! Huh! as if I\u0027d carry it out on my shoulder, which I\u0027d have to do or cheat the expressman out of his dues.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry you are going,\" Charles said. \"I wish we could be neighbors.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, so am I,\" the other responded, listlessly, \"but we can\u0027t have everything our way. After all, the sleeping is good in the parks such weather as this. I\u0027ve done it, and I can do it again, but I sha\u0027n\u0027t need a trunk. I\u0027ll leave it. And I\u0027ll pay Mrs. Reilly some day. I\u0027ve always paid my way.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Some one was coming. It was the landlady herself. Her face was very grave and full of feeling. She seemed slightly surprised at finding the two men together. Charles explained how they had met at breakfast. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And he sent you to me?\" she said. \"He recommended me?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, that is how I got the address,\" Charles returned. \\n\\n \\n\\n She turned on the young man suddenly. She was trying to smile, though her face was full of contradictory emotions. \"Mr. Mason,\" she faltered, as she touched him on his arm, \"I must tell you the truth, and I\u0027ll do it right here, facing this gentleman. I hardly slept a wink last night, tired as I was from house-cleaning and beating carpets, because I said what I did yesterday about you leaving. And now I hear in this roundabout way that you have been trying to help me. Humph!\" she laughed, making a sound in her throat like a suppressed sob, \"do you think I\u0027m going to let you go? Not on your life. I\u0027ve never had a young man under my roof that I liked better. I\u0027d rather keep you here for nothing than to get money for the room from some of the scamps that are floating about.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You are very good, Mrs. Reilly,\" Mason said, with emotion on his part, \"but I don\u0027t think, owing you for three weeks already, that—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Three weeks nothing! Cut that out!\" she exclaimed. She strode to a window and examined the tattered shade. \"There is no demand for rooms now, anyway. Do you hear me, you are going to stay? I\u0027ve got to have new shades here, that\u0027s all there is about it. Yes, I want you to stay, Mr. Mason, and that settles it. You will find work, I\u0027m sure of it. It is a dull season, that\u0027s all. Business will pick up later. It always does.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Mason was blandly protesting, his color high in his cheeks, when she suddenly whirled from the room. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You are to stay!\" she called back from the head of the stairs. \"You talk to him, sir,\" she added to Charles. \"He is a nice young man and needs a home of some sort.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The situation being embarrassing, Charles went into his own room. Mason, now without his coat and his shirt-collar open, stalked in after him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sorry you had to hear all that,\" he said with wincing, tight-drawn lips. \"Great God! do you know, sir, that the hardest thing on earth for an able-bodied man to do is to receive help from a working-woman? God! it stings like fire—it kills me!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I see, I see,\" Charles answered. \"Your feeling is natural to your particular temperament. In your case you\u0027d better owe it to a man. I want to be frank with you, Mr. Mason. You can do me a favor. I have the money to spare, and I want you to let me advance it for you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You? You? Great God! man, you are not in earnest! You don\u0027t mean it!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But I do,\" Charles said, firmly. \"It is selfish on my part, too, for I don\u0027t want you to go away. I\u0027m a stranger here and I\u0027m lonely. I\u0027m out of work myself; I want your companionship; strangers though we are to each other, I feel as if we were old friends. I can\u0027t tell why this is, but I do.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I know, I guess,\" said the astounded man as he sank into the chair near the window. \"I suppose we are both troubled to some extent. I thought you looked bothered a little at breakfast this morning. I\u0027d like to be with you, too, but I couldn\u0027t start out in any stranger\u0027s debt like that, you know. It is—is almost as bad, you see, as owing a woman.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You mustn\u0027t feel as you do in regard to me, at least,\" Charles said. \"I am without a home. I don\u0027t want to be alone. I would love to share the little I have with you. Something draws me to you like ties of blood.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n It was significant that Mason made no reply. He leaned forward, clasping his big freckled hands between his knees. He dropped his head, his reddish-brown curls lopped over his wide brow. He was silent. Charles saw his shoulders rise and fall convulsively, as if he were trying to suppress a tumult of feeling. Presently he raised his head. His hunger-pinched lips were twisted awry. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My God!\" he gulped, \"I didn\u0027t know I\u0027d ever run across a fellow like you. I thank you! I thank you! I thank you!\" He got up; his knees, in his frayed, bulging trousers, shook visibly. He moved to the door, passed through it, and went into his own room. From his position near the door Charles saw him reel past the trunk, totter, and clutch a post of the old-fashioned bed. Holding it, he stood swaying back and forth, his head hanging low on a limp neck. Charles ran to him, caught his arm, and made him lie down on the bed. Mason was ghastly pale. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It is nothing,\" he said, trying to smile carelessly. \"It will pass over. I had it once yesterday in the street.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I know what it is.\" Charles bent over him tenderly. \"You are weak from hunger.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Do you think that is it?\" Mason asked, resignedly, doggedly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, and it has to end right here and now. We are friends, aren\u0027t we? I\u0027m going down and bring you something this minute. It is not a woman that is offering it, Mason. It is a friend who knows what suffering is. Wait! Lie still. I\u0027ll hurry back.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n From the restaurant where he had breakfasted that morning Charles secured some hot chicken broth with bread and coffee. As he was hurrying back, he met a newsboy selling afternoon papers. The thought darted through his brain that the papers might contain an account of his flight which had been telegraphed from Boston, and he bought a paper and thrust it into his pocket. He met Mrs. Reilly as he was entering the front door. Hurriedly he explained the reason for his bringing the food. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Good gracious!\" she cried. \"I thought he looked bad. One of my roomers said it was dope, but I didn\u0027t believe him. And I was turning him out in that condition! Think of it—just think of it!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I am to pay the back rent he owes, Mrs. Reilly,\" Charles said, putting the things down on a step of the chair and taking out his purse. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You? Not on your life!\" she threw back, warmly. \"Do you think I\u0027ll let a stranger come and do more for that poor boy than I\u0027ve done, when he was going about drumming up trade for me after what I said to him? Not on your life! I\u0027ll feed him, too, from this on. I\u0027ll bring him his breakfast if he ain\u0027t able to come down in the morning.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Seeing that she would not receive the money, Charles took up the things and ascended the stairs. He found Mason seated at the window in the cooling breeze from the open space in the rear. \\n\\n \\n\\n His eyes held the eager gleam of a starving man shipwrecked on a raft. He tried to make light of his hunger as Charles hurriedly placed a small table near him and filled a soup-plate with the rich broth, which contained tender fragments of chicken. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Here, tackle this, you chump!\" said Charles, and he laughed as he used to laugh in his school-days. \"The idea of your letting yourself starve in this great, enlightened, Christian city!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Mason obeyed. A warm look of reviving health was in his face as he drank the soup. The plate was soon empty. Charles filled it again, and poured out the hot coffee. As he did so he felt the folded newspaper in his pocket, and a sudden cool shock of dismay went through him. What might not the paper say? Some one might have seen him take the train in Boston. Some one might have watched him on his arrival in New York. The very house he was in might already be shadowed by instructed officials. Men nowadays were captured easily enough in the vast network of the detective system. \\n\\n \\n\\n As he crumbled his bread into the broth Mason\u0027s satisfied glance swept the face of his companion. \"What are you worried about?\" he asked. \"I saw you change all at once like you was thinking of something unpleasant. I hope it ain\u0027t me. My God! I don\u0027t want to be a burden on a man as kind as you are!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You? No, no! But I have my little troubles, Mason,\" Charles admitted, frankly. \"I try to keep my mind off of them, but they will sneak back at times. Don\u0027t think it is money; it is not that, and instead of being a burden you are just the reverse. You are a great help to me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry you have worries,\" Mason responded, with a sigh. \"But it seems to me that every one I meet has some trouble or other. The thing has its funny side, too. I could dance and sing with this feed in me, thanks to you. This morning, after I left you, I went looking for a job, as usual. I had failed to see the firms I had in view in Wall Street, and was standing in front of an old church down there when a shabbily dressed man with a red nose came up to me. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Say, boss,\u0027 he began, \u0027can you give a feller a dime to pay his carfare home? I\u0027m stranded here and got to get back.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It struck me as funny—his wanting money to get booze with, and me without bread, and I laughed in his face. \u0027Say,\u0027 I said, \u0027I was about to ask you the same question, but I\u0027ve never begged in my life, and I don\u0027t know how to go about it.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Oh, is that it? New hand, eh?\u0027 he said, very cordially. \u0027Well, young feller, I don\u0027t mind giving you a tip or two to start you out. I was green at it once myself. Now look here. You are too timid. Brace up. Nothing ventured, nothing gained. Pick \u0027em out as they come along. Take the best-dressed first. Learn to know the labels on cigars and make a break for the costly smokers. If you see a feller smiling, he\u0027s your game. If you see two prosperous-looking guys chatting in a friendly way, strike \u0027em both. One will try to outdo the other. I won a dollar in a game like that once out of two fellers getting in a fine auto. Women are all right, too, but when you see one coming you\u0027d better just hang your head and look sadlike, especially if you are at the lead-pencil game.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I thanked him,\" Mason finished, \"but I never profited by his advice. I simply can\u0027t beg. Say, is that an afternoon paper in your pocket? I wonder if it carries want ads?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t really know,\" Charles replied, drawing the paper out slowly and awkwardly, for in some way it seemed to cling to his pocket and his fingers were not apt as usual. He spread it out, and as he held it toward his companion some large head-lines on the first page caught his attention and a cold wave of despair swept over him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Robbery of a Boston Bank! Absconding Clerk Makes Away with Sixty Thousand Dollars. Ten Thousand Dollars Reward Offered!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Mason was taking the paper into his extended hand. It seemed to Charles as if the dismal room were enveloped in a mist. He heard Mason saying something as if from a great height or depth as he opened the rustling sheet. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Excuse me,\" Charles managed to say. \"I\u0027ll come back in a moment.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Mason made some reply which he did not hear, and Charles went into his own room, where he stood at the window, looking out over the back yards below. Why, he asked himself, was he so terribly alarmed all at once? Was not all this to be expected? To do him full credit, he was not even then thinking of himself. It was William. It was Celeste. It was little Ruth. They were first in his thoughts. Ah, after all, was his vicarious effort at rescue to fail totally? He stood at the window a long time, lost in a flood of reflections. It was now sundown. Lights in the rear rooms of the buildings across the court were flashing up. He heard a match being struck in Mason\u0027s room and the rustling of the tell-tale paper. He crept to the door, glanced in, and saw his new friend standing under a flaring gas-jet, with the first page of the paper before his eyes. Was he reading the Boston news? Would he couple his new friend\u0027s arrival on that particular train with the events described? Well, what did it matter? Something told him that even were he a murderer his secret would be safe with Mason; and yet, if possible to avoid it, Mason must not know, for Charles had promised his brother that no circumstances should wring the truth from him. Mason remained at the jet, reading as if wholly absorbed. There could be no doubt now that it was the Boston report that had caught his attention. \\n\\n \\n\\n Suddenly, while he watched him, Mason lowered the paper, and Charles had barely time to step back to the window before Mason was on the threshold, the paper in his hand. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Pardon me,\" he said, staring through the dusk at Charles, \"I did not mean to take your paper from you. I was expecting you back every minute and got to reading about—about\"—there was a slight pause here as it seemed to Charles\u0027s overwrought fancy—\"about a poor chap in Boston who got away with a pile of boodle. It is interesting, the whole tale. Booze, booze! The old, old story—secret speculations, and women. Family broken-hearted. Went back on his best friend, his only brother, who stands at the top socially. Gosh! I\u0027ve been reckless myself, but not like that, thank God! I\u0027ve been my own worst enemy, but I never hurt my people like that. I\u0027m sorry for the poor devil! I really am sorry! This paper speaks of the chap as having had lots of friends before he got to the bottom. They are usually like that, free and easy and kind-hearted. Oh, I guess he was tempted, poor devil! And he will be caught, they think. Left for New York last night and is hiding here.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Mason was offering him the open paper and Charles took it. Before a man so genuine as his new friend had shown himself to be, he could not bring himself to play a part. Silently he dropped the paper on his bed. He sat down by it, leaving Mason standing with a sort of dumb inquiry in his eyes. It was significant that Mason was now silent. It was significant that he seemed to be studying Charles\u0027s features in the dim light from the gas, studying them with an awkward, reluctant stare. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll read it later—later,\" Charles said, faintly, taking up the paper and laying it on the pillow of his bed. \"I hope you feel better since you\u0027ve eaten,\" he went on, lamely. \"I—I thought the soup would do you good, weak as you are.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The natural thing for Mason to have done would have been to reiterate his appreciation, but he only stood staring helplessly at Charles. Afterward Charles understood. The paper contained an accurate description of him—appearance, age, manner, and the very suit he was then wearing. Mumbling some excuse, Mason went back to his room. Charles heard him moving about, and now and then he saw his shadow flit across the floor of the hall. \\n\\n \\n\\n Some one was coming up the stairs. Could it be an officer of the law? Why not? He stood up to meet whatever fate was in store. He dared not look toward the stairs. He pretended to be unconcerned. Then he saw that it was only Mrs. Reilly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You must have fresh towels,\" she smiled, genially. \"I almost forgot them. I hope you like your room, Mr.—Mr.—I didn\u0027t get your name. I like to know who my roomers are, for parcels and mail are always coming.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Browne,\" he answered, impulsively, and then bit his lip to keep the word back. But it was too late, and the situation was complicated by the sudden appearance of Mason in the doorway of his room behind Mrs. Reilly. The startled look in his face and the fact that he disappeared at once showed that he had caught the name and grasped its significance. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Brown? That\u0027s common enough,\" Mrs. Reilly laughed. \"I\u0027ve had Browns and Whites and Blacks all at the same time. How is Mr. Mason? I\u0027m going in to see him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Turning, she went into Mason\u0027s room, and Charles heard her laughing and talking in her voluble way. He wanted her to leave so that he might read the printed condemnation of himself from his old home. She seemed to linger unnecessarily. Presently, however, she went down the stairs, and, lighting the gas, he read the article. Mason had given him a compact summary of the whole thing, but the details lashed him like whips of fire. It is one thing to make a sacrifice for a loved brother, but it is quite another to bear calmly such consequences as he was facing. It was plain now that even if he escaped he was forever lost to his past. \\n\\n \\n\\n He heard Mason coming back. What could the fellow want? \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I see,\" Mason began, almost huskily, \"that I am more deeply in your debt than I thought. Mrs. Reilly told me that you wanted to pay my back dues. I don\u0027t know what to say to show my appreciation. I have never, in all my knocking about, met a man with such a kind heart.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, don\u0027t mention that!\" Charles replied. \"It was nothing.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But it is—it is to me, you may be sure. I\u0027ll never forget it as long as I live. I want to serve you. I want to be your friend as you have been mine. I\u0027ve come here now to tell you that\"—Charles knew what he meant in full—\"that I will stick to you through thick and thin. I think I understand the—the trouble you spoke of just now. You will need a friend now, and I will be that friend.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Their eyes met. They both understood. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, I need a friend,\" Charles said, thickly, \"and it is good to find such a one in you. Some time I may be able to speak more freely about myself than I can now, but I will say that, as I see it, I am not—not quite as bad as one would think.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I know that. I\u0027d bet my very life on it,\" Mason declared, warmly. \"But let all that drop. Don\u0027t tell me anything. I know men, and I know you are pure gold. I want to help you and I will do it if it is possible.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Turning back, he entered his own room. A wonderful sense of security, blended with a sense of new-found comradeship, descended on the lonely, pursued man. He now had an adviser, a friend whom he could trust, and it was one who was capable of suffering, who even now was suffering. \\n\\n \\n\\n That night he slept soundly, strangely free from the fear of arrest. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2360/65876.html","bookId":416,"book":{"id":416,"title":"The Hills of Refuge","description":"简介： The house, a three-story red-brick residence, was on Walnut Street, near Beacon.
