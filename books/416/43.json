{"id":14029,"no":43,"title":"CHAPTER XXX","content":"The Boston family were at breakfast. William was in his place next to his wife, and his uncle, who now lived in the house, sat opposite him. The two men were talking of stocks, bonds, securities, and insurance rates. Celeste was taking no part in the conversation. In her morning dress she looked as frail and dainty as ever. \\n\\n \\n\\n Presently the maid who was waiting at the table bent over her shoulder and, smiling, whispered something to her. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, is he!\" Celeste exclaimed. \"Tell him to wait. I want to see him after breakfast.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Who is it, dear?\" William asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It is Michael,\" she returned. \"He has got back from New York. I want to find out how his mother is. He has been away longer than usual. I am afraid she may be worse.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Raising his coffee-cup to his lips, William dismissed the subject and continued his chat with his uncle. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We certainly have made the bank pay,\" the older man said. \"As you know, it was not in the best condition when I took hold of it. I had no idea running a bank was so interesting. I have handled my end well and you have yours. I have heartily enjoyed my work, but sometimes I am in doubt about you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"About me?\" William\u0027s eyes met the upward glance of his wife, and both looked at the old man inquiringly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes. You always seem nervous, overworked, and worried. I\u0027ve tried to make it out. Are you sure you are entirely well? You are getting gray, my boy, and your signature often has a shaky look. You don\u0027t smoke too much, do you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I think not,\" said William, and his eyes fell under the calm, penetrating stare of his wife. \"But I am nervous, and seem to be getting more so. I am thinking of a vacation.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That is right, take it,\" his uncle said. \"I can run the old boat awhile by myself.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Celeste remained at the table after they had left the room. She listened attentively and heard them closing the door as they went out into the street. No sooner were they away than she rang for the maid. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Please tell Michael that I want to see him,\" she said to the girl. \"He is still there, is he not?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, madam.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n In a moment Michael appeared, his hat in hand. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"When did you get back?\" Celeste asked, after she had greeted him and he stood at the end of the table, the dust of travel on his gray suit and in the hollows of his earnest blue eyes. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"At four o\u0027clock this morning, madam; I\u0027m pretty well done up.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How did you leave your mother?\" asked Celeste, and her eyes swept him from head to foot. It was plain to the servant that her questions were merely perfunctory. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Very well, thank you, madam. It is very kind of you to ask.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I am glad to hear it, Michael.\" Celeste faced him more directly now. \"I was afraid she was worse, for you know you were gone longer than usual.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"A few days longer, madam,\" Michael said. \"I had no idea of being detained, but I actually ran across a trace of Mr. Charles, and, knowing your anxiety, I—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You have found him—you have seen him!\" Celeste interrupted. \"I know it from the way you look, Michael.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, madam, I found him. After some trouble and quite a journey I located him and managed to meet and talk with him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sit down, Michael, sit down; you are tired.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He drew a chair back from the table and sat in it, his travel-stained hat on his knee. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Now tell me about him. Is he well?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"A perfect picture of health, madam,\" Michael beamed. \"He is living on an old plantation down in the mountains of Georgia, working like a common laborer, but he seemed satisfied.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Like a common laborer!\" Celeste repeated, sadly. \"Go on, tell me everything, Michael.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n At some length the old servant recounted his experiences from the moment of his meeting with Mason in New York till he had joined Charles in the South. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And the girl you speak of—the planter\u0027s daughter. You say she is—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The most beautiful and refined young lady I ever met, madam. I cannot tell you how well she impressed me. You could see by a look at her that she was of fine stock. She was very nice to me. I saw her father, too, but I did not meet him—a fine figure of a gentleman. A little run down in appearance, madam, but a courtly gentleman at bottom. The house was a fine old place. You could not blame a young man like Mr. Charles for wanting to settle there, after all the roving he had had to get away from—You understand what I mean, madam?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Celeste nodded breathlessly. \"You must tell me, Michael,\" she urged, \"if, in your opinion, Charles is in love with the young lady.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Michael hesitated; he fumbled the rim of his hat; he blinked under her steady stare. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Answer me, Michael,\" Celeste insisted. \"Surely he would not object to my knowing it if he is. You see, I am anxious to hear that he has found such happiness.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I may as well tell you that he made no secret of it, madam, but I regret to say that it has not brought him full contentment.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then she cares for some one else,\" Celeste said, regretfully. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"On the contrary, madam, I am sure that the feeling is mutual. I could see it in the way she looked at him, and in the way she treated me merely because I was a friend of his, as he told her in my presence.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But I don\u0027t understand,\" Celeste pursued. \"If they love each other—\" She went no further, knitting her brows perplexedly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It is this way, madam. Oh, Mr. Charles spoke plainly enough that night at the little hotel when he came to see me! You see, madam, he is conscientious—Mr. Charles is remarkably so, and he will not, he says, think of asking such a young lady to be his wife when he is—well, under a cloud.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh! Oh! That is it!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh yes, madam, and in that respect he is to be pitied. Even if he were willing to keep his—his little mistake from the young lady herself, he could not show her family proper credentials as to who he is. You see, he is at present a common farm-hand. The young lady seems to understand him, I should say, but her people and the community don\u0027t. You would be sorry for him if you could see him and hear him talk in his brave, manly, and patient way.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n At this point Michael told of the timely aid which had been given to Keith, the motive behind it, and the successful outcome of the operation. As he told it, it was a dramatic story which held Celeste spellbound. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And he gave even that money away!\" Celeste cried. \"I know he loves her, Michael, but, as you say, he is only a farm-hand and the other thing hangs over him. I know him well enough to understand that he\u0027d never think of marriage in his condition. Oh, he must be unhappy, Michael! As you say, she may be the one woman in all the world for him, and yet he has to give her up. Poor, dear Charlie!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, he is unfortunate, madam. He no longer drinks. All that is over. He is a man among men, madam. His simple life and regular habits have improved him wonderfully. He is a young giant of a man. His skin is clear, and his eye bright, but he is sad—yes, he is sad and thoughtful, especially when he speaks of home and the little girl. He cautioned me not to mention him to her. He wants her to think of him as dead, because the young soon forget those who die.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Celeste rose suddenly. \"I\u0027ll see you again,\" she said, clearing her husky throat. \"I must go now. I thank you, Michael. No one else could have done what you have done.\" At the door she suddenly wheeled on him. \"Michael, wait, please!\" she said. Her lips were twitching, her brows were contracted as if in deep, disturbed thought. She rested her thin white hands on the back of a chair and grasped it as for support. \"Michael,\" she continued, \"did it ever occur to you that Charles may have been drawn into that trouble by others and may not have been wholly to blame?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I can\u0027t say that I thought that, madam,\" said Michael, swinging awkwardly from one foot to the other and blinking. \"I did always think, and believe, too, that he wasn\u0027t at himself when it happened. I told him I thought that once, and he did not deny it. That is why I\u0027ve been so sorry for him, for a man ought not to be punished all his life for a thing that was done when he was—well, like Mr. Charles used to get.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I see; I see what you think,\" and Celeste nodded as if in affirmation of some thought of her own. \"And you say you think the two are in love with each other?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh yes, madam, and that is the sad part of it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And that but for Charles\u0027s secret trouble they would be married?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, madam. I have no doubt of it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Thank you, Michael. You may have done him a great service by—by going to see him when you did. I mean,\" she added, starting as from some inner fear, \"that reaching him just when you did with that money—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh yes, madam, Mr. Charles spoke of that a dozen times. You see, as I have tried to explain, it lifted a load from the young lady.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I understand that,\" Celeste said, musingly. \"And she is very pretty and sweet and gentle, you say?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"She is everything a lady ought to be, madam, and, oh, I must say my heart ached for her, too, for I could see how she felt about him. She is full of spirit. She is the kind that would fight for a man to the last ditch and drop of blood. But, oh, madam, it seemed so sad! There he was in a farmer\u0027s clothes, his hands as hard as stone, and she—why, madam, he treated her like she was a princess of royal rank, and all the time with that old, sad look he used to have when he was scolding himself to me after one of his little sprees around town. Almost the last thing he said to me, madam, was that when he had helped her all he could he intended to slip away, for her own good, and take up his life somewhere else among strangers. It was then, madam, I assure you, that I almost lost my religion. I\u0027ve been taught, madam, from my mother\u0027s knee—and she is a saint, if one ever lived—I say I\u0027ve been taught that our Saviour died to help men who repent, and there was Mr. Charles bowed down like that without a hand held out to him. He gave up all he loved here—you, the little girl—his \u0027Sunbeam,\u0027 as he called her down there—and his brother, and now, when he has found some one that he loves, he must give her up also and start to roving again. I shed tears. I couldn\u0027t help it, and it moved him. I could see that. We were in my room at the hotel. His face turned dark as he sat there on my bed trying to be calm. He stood up and shook himself and smiled. \u0027Mike,\u0027 he said, \u0027nothing counts that we do for ourselves. It is only by forgetting ourselves and helping others that we accomplish anything worth while.\u0027\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Thank you, Michael, I\u0027ll see you again soon,\" Celeste said, moving toward the door. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2360/65909.html","bookId":416,"book":{"id":416,"title":"The Hills of Refuge","description":"简介： The house, a three-story red-brick residence, was on Walnut Street, near Beacon.
