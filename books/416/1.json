{"id":13987,"no":1,"title":"PART I CHAPTER I","content":"The house, a three-story red-brick residence, was on Walnut Street, near Beacon. Its narrow front faced the state Capitol with its gold-sheeted dome; from its stoop one could look down on the Common and, from the corner of the street, see the Public Gardens. It was a Sunday morning and the Browne family were at breakfast in the dining-room in the rear of the first floor, just back of the drawing-room. The two rooms were separated by folding-doors painted white, as was the wainscoting of the dining-room. There was a wide bay window at the end, the sashes of which were up, and the spring air and sunshine came in, feeding the plants which stood in pots on the sill. \n \n William Browne, the head of the family, a banker of middle age, slender, sallow of complexion, partially bald, and of a nervous temperament, his mustache and hair touched with gray, sat reading the Transcript of the evening before. \n \n Opposite to him sat his wife, Celeste, a delicate woman somewhat under thirty years of age. She had once been beautiful, and might still be considered so, for her face was a rare one. Her eyes were deeply blue, and now ringed with dark circles which added to the beauty of her olive skin. The hand filling her husband\u0027s coffee-cup was thin, tapering, and almost as small as a child\u0027s. Her lips had a drawn, sensitive expression when she spoke as he lowered his paper to take the coffee she was holding out to him. \n \n \"You have not told me how your business is,\" she said. \n \n \"Why do you want to know?\" His irritation was obvious, though he was trying to hide it, as he dropped his paper at his side and all but glared at her over his cup. \n \n \"I think I ought to know such things,\" she answered. \"Besides I worry considerably when—when I think you are upset over financial matters.\" \n \n \"Upset?\" He stared, it seemed almost fearfully, at her, and then began to eat the brown bread and fish-cakes on his plate. \"Why do you think that I am upset?\" \n \n \"I can always tell,\" she faltered. \"When you are disturbed over business you don\u0027t notice Ruth when you come in. You almost pushed her from your lap last night when she went to you in the library. It hurt the little thing\u0027s feelings. She did not know what to make of it.\" \n \n \"A position like mine is full of responsibility,\" he said, doggedly. \"Hundreds of things go wrong. Mistakes are made sometimes. We are handling other people\u0027s money. The directors are harsh, puritanical men, and they are very hard to please. They want me to do it all, and they think I am infallible, or ought to be.\" \n \n \"You didn\u0027t sleep well last night,\" Celeste continued, still timidly. \"I heard you walking to and fro. I smelled your cigars. I couldn\u0027t sleep, for it seemed to me that you were unusually disturbed. You may not remember it, but you ate scarcely anything at supper, and, although I asked you several questions, you did not hear me.\" \n \n He bolted the mouthful of bread he had broken off. His eyes flashed desperately. \"Oh, I can\u0027t go into all the details of our ups and downs!\" he blurted out, shrugging his shoulders with impatience. \"When I leave the bank I try to shut them in behind me. If I go over them with you it is like living through them again.\" \n \n \"Then—then it is not your brother this time,\" Celeste ventured. \"I thought perhaps the directors had spoken of his conduct again.\" \n \n \"Oh no. On my account they allow him to go and come as he likes. When he is not drinking he does splendid work—as much, often, as two men. The directors know he is worth his pay even as it is. Sometimes he gets behind with his work, but soon catches up again. In fact, they all seem to like him. They think he can\u0027t help it. It is hereditary, you know. Both of his grandfathers were like that.\" \n \n \"You knew that he was drinking yesterday, did you?\" Celeste inquired, with concern in her voice and glance. \n \n \"Oh yes. He wasn\u0027t at his desk at all. I heard him come in and go to his room about three this morning. I knew by his clatter on the stairs that it was all he could do to get along. I think he came home in a cab; I heard wheels.\" \n \n \"Yes, he came in a cab,\" Celeste said. \"Some friend brought him. I was awake. I heard them saying good night to each other. So it was not that that worried you?\" \n \n William shrugged his shoulders. \"I have given him up,\" he said. \"I almost envy him, though—he has so little to worry about.\" \n \n \"How can you say such things?\" his wife demanded. \"I shall never give him up. He has such a great heart. He is absolutely unselfish. He has given away a great deal of money to people who needed it. You know that he helped Michael send funds to his mother in New York last month. Michael worships him—actually worships him.\" \n \n Browne took up his paper again. It was plain that he had dismissed his younger brother from his mind. At this moment the servant just mentioned, Michael Gilbreth, came to remove the plates. He was a stout, red-faced Irishman of middle age and wore the conventional, though threadbare, jacket of a family butler. \n \n \"Have you inquired if Mr. Charles wants any breakfast?\" Mrs. Browne asked him, softly, as he bent beside her for the coffee-urn. \n \n \"Yes, m\u0027m,\" he said. \"I was up just this minute. He wants coffee and eggs and toast. He said to say that he would not be down to breakfast.\" \n \n \"Is he sober? Is he at himself?\" the banker asked, in a surly tone, from behind his paper. \n \n For a bare instant the servant hesitated. His entire bent body seemed to resent the question. \"Yes, sir, he is all right; a little sleepy, I think, but that is all. He\u0027ll be around later. He is a fine young man, sir; he has a big heart in \u0027im, sir. He is a friend to the poor as well as the rich.\" \n \n \"A very poor one to himself, and us,\" Browne retorted, irritably. \"But it can\u0027t be helped. He is done for. He will keep on till he is in the gutter or a madhouse.\" \n \n \"Take the coffee and warm it again, Michael,\" Celeste said, a subtle stare of resentment in her eyes. \"He was to go to church with Ruth and me, but say to him, please, that we are not going this morning.\" \n \n \"Very well, madam, I\u0027ll tell him, though he will be ready to go, I\u0027m sure. He always keeps his engagements. He intended to go, I know, for he had me get out his morning suit and brush it.\" \n \n \"Tell him I have other things to do and won\u0027t have time to get ready this morning,\" Celeste said, firmly. \"Remember to say that, Michael.\" \n \n The butler had just left when a child\u0027s voice, a sweet, musical voice, came from the first landing of the stairs in the hall. \n \n \"Mother, please let me come as I am. I have my bathrobe on, and my slippers. I have bathed my face and hands and brushed my hair.\" \n \n \"Well, come on, darling—this time!\" \n \n \"When will you stop that, I wonder?\" The banker frowned as he spoke. \"What will she grow up like? What sort of manners will she have? You are her worst enemy. A habit like that ought not to fix itself on her, but it will, and it will foster others just as bad.\" \n \n \"Leave her training to me,\" Celeste said, crisply. \"You don\u0027t see her once a week. She is getting to be afraid of you. You are upset now by some business or other, and it is making you as surly as a bear.\" \n \n \"Do you think so—do you really think that?\" He laid the paper down and gave her a steady, almost anxious look. \"I don\u0027t want to get that way. I know that hard, mental work and worries do have a tendency to spoil men\u0027s moods.\" \n \n \"Oh, it is all right,\" Celeste said, her eyes on the doorway through which her daughter, a golden-haired, brown-eyed child of five years, was approaching. She was very graceful, in the long pink robe—very dainty and pretty. She had her mother\u0027s slender hands and feet, the same sensitive lips and thoughtful brow. She ran into her mother\u0027s arms, was fondly, almost passionately embraced, and then she went to her father, timidly, half shrinkingly kissed his lowered cheek, and then pushed a chair close to her mother\u0027s side. \n \n \"Shall I have coffee this morning?\" she whispered. \n \n \"Yes, but not strong, dear.\" Celeste\u0027s lips formed the words as they played over the brow of the child. \"I must put a lot of milk in it.\" \n \n Browne bent forward tentatively. It was as if the sight of his child had inspired him with a softer mood, as if her sunlight had vanquished some of the clouds about him. He smiled for the first time that morning. \n \n \"Don\u0027t you think you could have dressed before you came down?\" he gently chided the child, reaching out and putting his hand on her head caressingly. \"Naughty, careless little girls act as you are doing.\" \n \n \"I didn\u0027t have time,\" the child said, leaning against her mother\u0027s shoulder and causing his hand to fall from her head. \"If I had dressed, both of you would have been gone from the table before I got ready, and I don\u0027t like to eat alone; besides, Uncle Charles was talking to me.\" \n \n \"Talking to you? Where?\" Celeste asked, surprised. \n \n \"In my room. What is the matter with him, mother?\" \n \n \"Matter? Why do you ask that?\" Celeste inquired, her face grave, her voice sinking low. \n \n \"Because, mother, he acts so strangely. He came in while I was asleep. I don\u0027t know how long he was there. When I waked up he was seated on the foot of my bed. He didn\u0027t see me looking at him, for he had his hands over his face, pushing his fingers into his eyes, this way.\" The little girl put her hands to her face, the wide sleeves of her robe falling down to her shoulders and baring her beautiful dimpled arms. \"He was talking to himself in the strangest way, almost ready to cry. \u0027I\u0027d like to be a child!\u0027 I heard him say that, mother—I\u0027m sure I heard him say that. I closed my eyes, for I didn\u0027t know what to do. Then I think—I think he must have been praying or something. He bent down a minute, and then sat up. I could feel him moving and I heard him groaning. Presently he was still and I peeped at him. He was looking at me with tears in his eyes, mother—great big tears. They came on his cheeks and fell down on his hands. He saw that I was awake, and put his hand on my head and brushed back my hair. Oh, I was so sorry for him, and I don\u0027t know why! He kissed me. He took me in his lap and hugged me, holding my face to his. Then he put me back, and I heard him say: \u0027I have no right to touch her. She is pure, and I am\u0027—he said some word that I do not know. He got my robe and slippers and helped me put them on, awfully sweet and nice, mother. Then I told him I was going down to breakfast. I offered to kiss him, and at first he wouldn\u0027t let me. He stood shaking his head and looking so sad and strange. \u0027You ought not to kiss me, if you are my little niece,\u0027 he said. \u0027I am not a good uncle, Ruth. You will be ashamed to own me when you are a young lady and go to balls and parties. People will not mention me to you. But I will go away and never come back. Mother, is he going off? I hugged him and begged him not to leave, and he began to cry again. He was trying not to, and he shook all over. Presently he said he might not go away if I wanted him to stay. Oh, mother, what is the matter with him? What is the matter with you? Why, you are crying, too! Don\u0027t, mother, don\u0027t!\" \n \n Celeste, her handkerchief to her eyes, had turned her face aside. \n \n \"Oh, why do you do this?\" Browne asked, impatiently. \"Don\u0027t you see how emotional the child is? All this can\u0027t be good for her. Charles ought to be kicked, the rascal! Why doesn\u0027t he keep his remorse to himself? He is like this after every spree, and he will do it all over again.\" \n \n Celeste, as if regretting her show of emotion, wiped her eyes, straightened up, and forced a smile. \"You must eat an egg this morning, darling,\" she said to her daughter. \"Don\u0027t worry about your uncle. He is not very well, but he will be all right soon.\" \n \n \"And he won\u0027t go away?\" Ruth asked, anxiously. \n \n \"No, he won\u0027t go away, dear,\" Celeste said. \"We\u0027ll keep him. You must love him and be kind to him.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2360/65867.html","bookId":416,"book":{"id":416,"title":"The Hills of Refuge","description":"简介： The house, a three-story red-brick residence, was on Walnut Street, near Beacon.
