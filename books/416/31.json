{"id":14017,"no":31,"title":"CHAPTER XVIII","content":"As she walked on Mary was glad that Frazier had been called away before he had asked her whither she was going, for she did not want him to know that she had decided to call at Tobe Keith\u0027s home and inquire personally about his condition. It struck her as being incongruous that she was already keeping things from the man she might eventually marry. And at this moment various thoughts of Charles fairly besieged her brain. Somehow she could not imagine herself keeping any vital thing from him. How strange, and he such a new friend! She found herself blushing, she knew not why. What was it about the man that appealed to her so strongly? Was it the mystery that constantly enveloped him, and out of which had come such a stream of generous acts, or was it the constant heart-hungry and lonely look of the man who certainly was out of his natural sphere as a common laborer? \n \n Her way took her through the poorest section of the little town. Small houses, some having only two and three rooms each, bordered the rugged, unpaved little streets. Part of the section was known as the \"Negro Settlement,\" and there stood a little steepled church, with green blinds, the walls of which, in default of paint, had received frequent coatings of whitewash at the hands of the swarthy devotees. She had no trouble in finding her way, for she already had a general idea of where the mother of the wounded man lived, and only had to ask as to the particular house. \n \n \"Can you tell me where Mr. Keith lives?\" she inquired of a little negro boy amusing himself in a swing. \n \n \"You mean the man that was kilt?\" the child asked, blandly, as he halted himself by thrusting his bare feet down on the ground. \n \n \"The man that was—hurt,\" Mary corrected, shuddering over the way the boy had put his reply. \n \n \"De las\u0027 house at the end er de street, on dis yer side. You cayn\u0027t miss it. Miz\u0027 Keith got grape-vines in \u0027er front yard, en\u0027 er goat en\u0027 chickens en\u0027 ducks.\" \n \n She found it without trouble. The house had four small rooms and a crude lean-to shed which served as a kitchen. A slender, thin woman of the lowest class of whites, about fifty years of age, scantily attired in a plain print skirt and a waist of white cotton material, her iron-gray hair plastered down on the sides of her face from a straight part in the middle of her head and drawn to a small doughnut-shaped knot behind, sat in the doorway smoking a clay pipe with a reed stem. As Mary arrived at the little gate, which was kept closed by a rope fastened to a stake and from which hung a brick for a weight, she looked up, drew her coarsely shod feet under her, and took the pipe from her mouth. She must have recognized the visitor, for she contracted her thin brows and allowed a sullen, resentful expression to spread over her wrinkled face and tighten the muscles of her lips. \n \n \"May I come in, Mrs. Keith?\" Mary asked, holding the gate partly open and dubiously waiting for a response. \n \n The pipe was clutched more firmly and the woman stared straight at her. \"You may come in if you want to,\" was the caustic answer. \"We don\u0027t keep no bitin\u0027 dog. I didn\u0027t \u0027low the likes of you would want to come, after what\u0027s happened, but if you do I can\u0027t hinder you an\u0027 Tobe hain\u0027t able to prevent it, nuther.\" \n \n \"Who is it, mother?\" came a faint voice from within the house. \n \n \"Never mind, sonny, who it is,\" the old woman called back. \"I\u0027ll tell you after awhile. Remember what the doctor said, that you must not get excited an\u0027 lift your fever.\" \n \n There was silence in the room behind the grim sentinel at the door, and Mary lowered her voice almost to a whisper. \n \n \"Perhaps I\u0027d better go away, Mrs. Keith,\" she faltered. \"I thought I might see you alone. That\u0027s why I came. I don\u0027t want to disturb your son—I wouldn\u0027t, for all the world. Mrs. Keith, I am unhappy over this, too.\" \n \n \"Huh! I don\u0027t see nothin\u0027 fer you to be upset over!\" sneered the old woman. \"Your brothers lit out fer new fields an\u0027 pastures with money to pay expenses with, like all highfalutin folks manage to git, while us pore scrub stock o\u0027 whites has to suffer, like Tobe is thar on his back, unable to move, an\u0027 with barely enough t\u0027 eat except what neighbors send in.\" \n \n No seat was offered the visitor; the speaker grimly kept her chair, her stiff knees parted for the reception between them of her two gnarled rebellious hands and the clay pipe. \n \n \"I came to ask—I had to come,\" Mary faltered, her sweet face whitened by the rising terrors within her. \"I came to see if any arrangements are being made to—to—I understand the doctors advise your son\u0027s removal to Atlanta, and—\" \n \n \"They advise anything to shuffle the blame off their own shoulders,\" blurted out the stubborn woman. \"They see they ain\u0027t able to do nothing, an\u0027 they want my boy to die some\u0027r\u0027s else, to save the county the expense of—of—\" and she choked down a sob, a dry, alien thing in her scrawny neck. \"I don\u0027t believe he\u0027ll ever be sent, so I don\u0027t. Sis Latimer, my cousin, a preacher\u0027s wife, has traipsed over two counties, tryin\u0027 to raise the four hundred dollars, and now says it can\u0027t be done. That was the last straw to Tobe. He lay thar, after she left, an\u0027 I heard \u0027im cryin\u0027 under the sheet, to keep me from hearin\u0027 him. He says he hain\u0027t got nothin\u0027 ag\u0027in\u0027 your two brothers now. He says they was all to blame, an\u0027 if they hadn\u0027t been drunk an\u0027 gamblin\u0027 it wouldn\u0027t \u0027a\u0027 happened. Tobe\u0027s a odd boy—he forgives in a minute; but I hain\u0027t that way. I know how your brothers felt. They looked on my boy like dirt under their feet because you folks used to own niggers and live so high in your fine house with underlings to run an\u0027 fetch for you at every call. Kenneth Rowland would have thought a second time before pullin\u0027 down on a feller in his own set. Oh, I heard the filthy name he called Tobe, an\u0027 I didn\u0027t blame my boy for hittin\u0027 him, as they say he did, smack on the jaw. A blow with the bare hand, after a word like that is passed, doesn\u0027t justify the use of a gun while another feller is pinnin\u0027 a man\u0027s arms down at his side so he can\u0027t budge an inch. I\u0027ll tell you what you may not know, an\u0027 that is that if my boy does die them two whelps will be hunted down and strung up by the neck till they are dead, dead, dead! Thar never was a plainer case o\u0027 murder—cold-blooded murder. They say—folks say your brothers are livin\u0027 like lords in the West on money sent to \u0027em by rich kin to escape disgrace. The sheriff said so hisse\u0027f, an\u0027 he ort to know. He\u0027s jest waitin\u0027 to see what comes o\u0027 Tobe. Your turn an\u0027 your stiff-backed, haughty old daddy\u0027s is comin\u0027, my fine young lady.\" \n \n The faint voice was heard protesting from the interior of the house, and Mrs. Keith rose and stalked to the bed on which the wounded man lay. He said something in a low, guarded tone and Mary heard his mother answer: \n \n \"I wouldn\u0027t do that if I was you, honey. Let \u0027er go on. I can\u0027t stan\u0027 the sight of \u0027er, after what has happened. She looks so uppity, in \u0027er fine clothes an\u0027 white skin not touched by the sun, while me an\u0027 you—\" \n \n The man\u0027s voice broke in, plaintively rumbling, as if from a great distance. He must have been insisting on some point to be gained, for he continued talking, now and then coughing and spitting audibly. \n \n \"Well, well,\" Mrs. Keith exclaimed, \"I\u0027ll tell \u0027er. I think it is foolish, but I\u0027ll tell \u0027er. Do you want me to comb your head a little an\u0027 spruce you up some?\" \n \n He evidently did, for Mary was kept waiting ten minutes longer. Then the sullen virago appeared in the doorway. \"Tobe wants you to come in and see \u0027im,\" she reluctantly announced. \n \n Despite the feeling that she was unwelcomed by the woman, Mary saw no alternative but to go in. She regretted it the instant her eyes fell on the wasted form on the unkempt bed and beheld the eager orbs peering at her from deep, dark sockets beneath shaggy brows. The room seemed to swing around her, the crude board floor to rise and fall like the waves of a rocking sea, the bed to float like a raft holding a starving derelict. Grasping the back of a chair for support, Mary leaned on it for a moment, and then, slightly recovering, she sat down, wondering if she could possibly bear the impending ordeal. \n \n \"I\u0027m glad you thought enough o\u0027 me to come, Miss Mary,\" Tobe began, in the instinctive tone of respect that his class had for hers, \"an\u0027 I want to say something to you.\" He hesitated and lifted his eyes to his mother, who was standing at the foot of his bed. \"Ma,\" he said, \"will you please go out a little while—just a little while?\" \n \n \"Me! Why, I\u0027d like to know?\" she fiercely demanded. \"Surely you hain\u0027t got no secrets from me?\" \n \n \"I hain\u0027t got no secrets, but I want to talk free an\u0027 easy like to Miss Mary, an\u0027 somehow when you stan\u0027 lookin\u0027 like that an\u0027 thinkin\u0027 what I know you are thinkin\u0027—well, I just can\u0027t talk, that\u0027s all.\" \n \n \"Humph! I say! Well, this is a pretty come-off!\" Mrs. Keith fairly quivered with suppressed rage. \"Can\u0027t talk before me, eh? An\u0027 me your mother at that. Well, well, I won\u0027t hender you, though you know the doctor told me to keep you perfectly quiet, an\u0027 here you are—Well, well, I\u0027ll go; if you feel that-away I\u0027ll go! A mother\u0027s feelings is never paid attention to nohow.\" \n \n Mary tried to protest, but could think of nothing to say under the circumstances; besides, the angry woman was already whirling away. Mary heard her treading the creaking boards of the adjoining room. \n \n \"Please move your chair up a little mite closer,\" Tobe requested. \"I\u0027ve got just so much wind, an\u0027 no more, an\u0027 I can talk easier when you are close to me.\" \n \n She obeyed, feeling like an inanimate thing pushed forward by some designing force. His thin hand lay within her reach. It was a repulsive object, and yet the same force directed her to take it; she did so, and with the act all her fears, all her timidity, left her. She pressed it gently; she leaned forward and stroked it almost caressingly with her other hand. Tears welled up in her eyes; they broke their bounds and fell upon her hands and his. He stared in slow astonishment, his lower lip quivered; he closed his great, somnolent eyes as if to give himself up to the dreamlike ecstasy of the moment. She saw his breast shaking, his throat moving as if he were swallowing rising sobs. Silence fell, broken only by the creaking boards in the next room, the clucking of a busy hen in the yard, the chirping of little chickens, the thwacking of an ax at a wood-pile not far away. Tobe turned his face from her. She saw him stealthily wiping his eyes on a soiled handkerchief. \n \n \"I\u0027m gittin\u0027 to be a fool, a babyish fool,\" he said, presently. \"Lyin\u0027 here like this is calculated to make a feller that-away, an\u0027 you bein\u0027 so kind an\u0027 gentle, too, is—is sorter surprisin\u0027. A sick man can hear a lot o\u0027 ridiculous things when he is down like this. You see, I\u0027m surrounded mostly by women, an\u0027 they chatter a lot. Anyways, you hain\u0027t nothin\u0027 like most of \u0027em say you are—too proud an\u0027 stuck up even to inquire about a feller in my fix. Yes, I\u0027m glad you come, so I am. I hain\u0027t heard anything lately but revenge! revenge! revenge! The idle women that huddle about me through the day talk hate from morning to night. They got Ma at it; she hain\u0027t that-away as a general thing. I wanted to see you. I\u0027ve seen you at a distance an\u0027 always wanted to get a closer look. They all say you are pretty, an\u0027 so you are. By all odds, I should count you the prettiest young lady in this part o\u0027 the country. I know I hain\u0027t never seed one that could hold a candle to you. I want to talk to you about Ken an\u0027 Martin. Miss Mary, them boys hain\u0027t bad at heart. La! I used to love \u0027em both, an\u0027 they liked me, too! It was just rot-gut liquor. Mart didn\u0027t mean no harm by holdin\u0027 me when that scrimmage begun, an\u0027 Ken may have thought he saw a knife in my hand that I was about to stab into Martin. I understand that\u0027s what he claimed before they made off to the West, an\u0027 it all may be so, for a drunk feller will think all sorts o\u0027 things. I wanted to see you because, if I do peg out—an\u0027 it looks like I\u0027m goin\u0027 to—I want you to write this to the boys. I want you to tell \u0027em, Miss Mary, that you saw me an\u0027 that Tobe Keith said he didn\u0027t bear no ill-will an\u0027 died without hard feelin\u0027s. Tell \u0027em, too, that I said I hoped they would show the law a clean pair o\u0027 heels, for it looks like they will have trouble if they are fetched back here. Oh, I\u0027m sorry for \u0027em! I saw, while I was lyin\u0027 thar, how sorry them boys looked when they saw what had happened. It sobered \u0027em in a minute, an\u0027 they would have stayed to help me if their friends hadn\u0027t got scared an\u0027 told \u0027em to run, that the sheriff was comin\u0027, an\u0027 the like.\" \n \n \"You mustn\u0027t say you are going to die, Tobe,\" Mary faltered, huskily, still gently stroking his hand. Beads of perspiration were on his sallow brow, and with her handkerchief she wiped them away. \"The doctors say that if you go to Atlanta, to Doctor Elliot\u0027s sanatorium, he can—\" \n \n \"I\u0027ve given that up.\" He smiled faintly. \"The money ain\u0027t in sight an\u0027 never will be. Besides, they only want to experiment on me. I know my condition better than they do. Surgical skill may be all right in many such cases, but mine has stood too long. I hain\u0027t afeard to die, Miss Mary, but I am sorry my going will be so serious for Ken an\u0027 Martin. Do you know, I was to blame chiefly. I was the one that furnished the whisky for that racket. I got it from a moonshiner I know. That is between you an\u0027 me, Miss Mary, for I broke the law when I went to his secret still an\u0027 got it without reportin\u0027 him.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2360/65897.html","bookId":416,"book":{"id":416,"title":"The Hills of Refuge","description":"简介： The house, a three-story red-brick residence, was on Walnut Street, near Beacon.
