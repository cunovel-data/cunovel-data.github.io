{"id":14007,"no":21,"title":"CHAPTER VIII","content":"The next day was a wet one. Charles heard the rain beating on his window when he waked. Dressing hurriedly, for his watch showed that he was late, he went down-stairs. No one was in sight. Going to the dining-room, he saw Zilla putting his coffee at his plate. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I heard yer comin\u0027,\" she said, agreeably. \"My white folks ain\u0027t up yit. Marse Andy al\u0027ays sleeps late on er wet day, en young miss just got back from town en is in \u0027er room, tryin\u0027 ter res\u0027. She saddled de hoss \u0027erse\u0027f \u0027bout midnight en rode off. She said she couldn\u0027t sleep nohow widout knowin\u0027 how Tobe Keith was gittin\u0027 on. I tried ter stop \u0027er, en so did \u0027er pa, but she would go.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And did she get favorable news?\" Charles asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He\u0027s des de same as he was,\" Zilla replied, with a sigh. \"He\u0027s powerful critical. She waited dar all night at de hotel wid Miz\u0027 Quinby. One minute she\u0027d hear one thing, and den ergin sumpin\u0027 else. Po\u0027 chile talk erbout war-times en slave days? Dat po\u0027 chile has mo\u0027 ter bear dan \u0027er ma en pa ever went th\u0027oo when dey was all fightin\u0027 fer de ole state.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The rain was still falling heavily when he left the table, and as he stood in the front doorway and realized that it was too wet for hoeing, he suddenly thought of the blacksmith shop and the work he had planned to do in sharpening the tools. Glad of something to busy himself with, he went to the shop, kindled a fire in the antiquated forge, and began to work. There was something vaguely soothing in the splash and patter of the rain on the low, blackened roof of split oaken boards, the sucking of the air into the bellows, the creaking of the bellows chains, the ringing of the anvil, and the spray of metallic sparks in the half darkness of the room. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was near noon. The rain had ceased, though the clouds were still heavy and lowering. He was hammering on a red plowshare when Mary suddenly appeared in the doorway. Her back was to the outer daylight, her face dimly lighted by the slow blaze of the forge. She advanced into the shop, paused and scanned the heap of sharpened tools on the ground near the tub of blackened water which was used for cooling the metal. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What a wonder you are!\" she cried, with an attempt at a lightness he knew she did not feel. \"You have already done ten dollars\u0027 worth of work this morning. You see I know, for I pay the bills.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It is nothing,\" he answered. \"I wanted to be busy.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I heard the ringing of the anvil when I waked, and knew what it meant. Yes, you are wonderful, and I am afraid\"—she tried to smile—\"that you are too valuable for us. I was thinking about you on my way to town last night. You won\u0027t stay here. You can\u0027t stand this sort of thing—I mean the awful mess you find us in. I wouldn\u0027t blame you for leaving us. Why, I\u0027ll be frank with you, Mr. Brown—it is only fair to you as a stranger in this locality. There are plantations only a few miles away where you would find more people employed, where they have some sort of amusement, and where the people you\u0027d work for would not be upset and depressed as we are. I did want to save our crops, now that they are planted, but, facing this other thing, the crops count for nothing—nothing at all. If God would show me a way to save my brothers I\u0027d give my very soul in payment. You don\u0027t know—no one could know how I feel. I am stretched on a cross, Mr. Brown. I am praying with every breath I draw, but I am stifling under the dread of what may happen. At this very minute Tobe Keith may—may—\" she groaned, leaned against the bellows and stood shuddering, cowed and wild-eyed, under the horror her mind had pictured. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t, don\u0027t, please don\u0027t!\" he cried. \"Don\u0027t give up. Don\u0027t lose hope. There is always hope. I lost it once in—in a great trouble, but I lived through it somehow. You will, too. Some wise man has said that God does not lay any burden on any one that is too heavy to bear. Think of that—believe that; it comforted me once. It is comforting me now in the belief that you will escape from this terrible thing.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, do you think so—do you?\" and she wrung her hands, lowered her head again, and uttered a little wail that ended in a sob. \\n\\n \\n\\n He all but reached out his hands toward her in a strange, bold impulse to take her into his arms, but checked himself and stood aghast as he contemplated the catastrophe which might have followed such an unwarranted act. Had he subconsciously leaped back to the free period before his downfall, or, as a regenerated man, had he for an instant felt himself to be on her level? Ah no, it was the kinship again—the kinship of suffering souls. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure of it,\" he repeated. \"If I thought otherwise I\u0027d see no good in life at all. Men deserve punishment for the wrong they do, but gentle girls like you must not suffer for the mistakes of men. It will pass over—your cloud will blow away.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, oh!\" and she put her hands to her dry eyes while her shoulders shook. \"I hope—you make me hope a little, somehow—that what you say may be true. You comfort me more than everybody else put together. It is your way, your voice, your look. You are a good, kind man, Mr. Brown. How strange that you came just when you did! I\u0027ll try to be braver. I\u0027ll try to stop thinking that every approaching person on the road is coming to tell me the worst.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That is right,\" he said. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And would you pray—would you continue to pray?\" she asked, with the timid simplicity of a child groping in the dark. \\n\\n \\n\\n Their eyes met steadily. \"I don\u0027t know how to advise you as to that,\" he said, after a pause full of thought. \"I must confess that I am not religious. I used to pray, as a child, but I don\u0027t now.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, I shall keep it up,\" she said, quietly. \"There are moments when it seems to help. I prayed to be allowed to sleep this morning, and I did. You see, I need the strength. If I go to pieces all may be lost, for my father can do nothing.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She turned back to the house. The rain had ceased, though the clouds were still thick and lowering. The forge blazed again; the anvil rang as he pounded the yielding steel into shape. He had forgotten himself and his past; the new existence was buoying him up again. Nothing mattered but the woes which had come to Mary Rowland and the necessity of his shouldering them—fighting them. \\n\\n \\n\\n When the bell rang for lunch he went into the house. He found Mary in the dining-room, packing some food into a basket. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It is for the boys,\" she explained. \"I am glad it is clearing up, for I must take it to them.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You?\" he cried, in surprise. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes,\" she made answer, simply. \"Father and I are the only ones who know where the boys are. Father is in town now to wait for news and to attend to some business with Mr. Frazier at the bank. Father would not want me to go, but some one must.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Might I not go in your place?\" he asked, and he actually held his breath while he waited for her reply. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You don\u0027t know the way,\" she said. \"It is hard even for me to find.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He looked at the heavy basket. \"But you can\u0027t carry that by yourself. May I not carry it for you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She glanced at him gratefully. \"Would you really care to go?\" she inquired. \"It is a long walk, and difficult even in dry weather.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Please!\" he said. \"You ought not to go alone.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Thank you; but first get your dinner. I don\u0027t want any. I have only just eaten my breakfast.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n When they started out, half an hour later, the clouds had lifted somewhat, though they were still full of rain. They went through the barn-yard, climbed over the rail fence, and entered the near-by thicket, which stretched on into the sloping woodland of the mountains. The wet weeds and grass were already dampening her shoes, and, noting it, he paused suddenly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You really ought not to expose yourself this way,\" he protested. \"Your feet will be soaked in a very short time.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It doesn\u0027t matter,\" she said. \"Nothing matters, Mr. Brown, but the fate that hangs over my brothers. I think I could wade in water up to my knees for days at a time and not be conscious of discomfort. It isn\u0027t one\u0027s body that feels the greatest pain, it is the mind, the soul, the memory. The pain comes from the futility of hoping. Life is a tragedy, isn\u0027t it?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes and no,\" he answered, smiling into her expectant, upturned face, the beauty of which had deepened under her gloom. \"I have thought so at times, but there were always rifts in my clouds. There will be in yours.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How sweet and noble of you!\" she said, tremulously, in her emotion. Suddenly he saw that she was studying his face closely, feature by feature. Then she continued, as one rendering a verdict: \"Yes, you have suffered. I see the traces of it. It lurks in the tone of your voice; it shows itself in your sympathy for me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Without revealing his new-found passion for her, which surged within him like a raging torrent, there was nothing he could say. Presently they came to a brook several yards in width and he could see no means of crossing it. She was disturbed for a moment, but to her surprise he stepped into the shallow water, took the basket to the other side and, wet to his knees, came wading back to her. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You must let me carry you across,\" he said, smiling. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, I\u0027m too heavy.\" She shook her head. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I could carry one of you under each arm,\" he jested. \"Come!\" He held out his hands. She hesitated. A touch of pink colored her cheeks, and then she came into his arms. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There,\" he directed, as he lifted her up, \"put your arm around my neck and lean toward me. Don\u0027t be afraid. That\u0027s right. I must be steady, you know, for there are round stones under my feet, and if I slipped we\u0027d both go down.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Reaching the other side, he put her down and took up the basket. His heart was beating like a trip-hammer. The flush was still on Mary\u0027s face. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You carried me as if I were a baby,\" she said. \"How very strong you are! I could feel the muscles of your arms like knotted ropes. What an odd mixture you are!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"In what way?\" he asked, as they moved on side by side. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I hardly know,\" she answered. \"Well, for one thing, you seem out of place as a common workman in the fields. You have the manner, the way of—\" She broke off, and the flush in her cheeks deepened. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ve been several things,\" he admitted, with a sigh. \"I ought to know something of life, for I\u0027ve had many experiences.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I was in your room this morning,\" she said. \"It is a desolate place for a man of your temperament. I must fix it up. The attic is full of old things—curtains, pictures, and even books. You must be lonely at times. I noticed a photograph on your bureau in a frame. It was that of a child, a beautiful little girl. She was so refined-looking, and so daintily dressed. She resembled you, about the eyes and brow.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Charles stared fixedly. He looked confused. \"Yes, I think we do look alike,\" he finally replied. Probably she expected him to say more, but how was it possible to explain? \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I think I understand,\" she said, almost in an undertone, as she strode on ahead of him. \"I now know why you look homesick at times. You must miss her.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He saw that she did not fathom the truth about the child, but he was not prepared for an adequate explanation and so he remained silent. However, the girl was making deductions. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It must be,\" she thought, as she forged her way through the damp bushes still ahead of him. \"It is his child. His wife must be living and they are separated, or he would speak of her. Poor fellow!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2360/65887.html","bookId":416,"book":{"id":416,"title":"The Hills of Refuge","description":"简介： The house, a three-story red-brick residence, was on Walnut Street, near Beacon.
