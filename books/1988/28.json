I could attest to the fact that she was gorgeous. It was hard to see anyone else around her. She commanded my complete attention.\n The wedding dinner, however, was another thing. Once again she was seated beside Jason, since he was her plus one, and I was across the table getting to witness it.\n She’d smiled at me reassuringly throughout the meal. I knew she was trying to get me to stop staring Jason down, but it couldn’t be helped. I was pissed, and I wanted him to leave.\n When the longest meal I’d ever sat through was over, Jason had stood up and congratulated Marcus and Low, then explained he had a plane waiting on him. Amanda said she’d walk him out. I didn’t want them alone. I trusted her, but I couldn’t say the same for Jason. Once they stepped out of the dining room, I started to stand up and follow them. Marcus’s hand gripped my arm tightly. “Don’t,” he whispered.\n “Let go of me,” I warned.\n “Listen to me. She doesn’t want him. She is being polite. He was her guest. Don’t make a scene. She’ll be right back.” Marcus was talking under his breath so no one could hear him but me. I knew he was right, but I didn’t like sitting here waiting.\n “What if he tries to kiss her?”\n “She’ll stop it. Trust her.”\n I did trust her, dammit.\n Amanda walked back into the room, and she immediately looked toward me. She mouthed, Let’s go. Then she turned to go say her good-byes to her mother and some guests.\n “I’m hoping you two find the time to see us off later,” Marcus said before I could even stand up. He’d read her lips too.\n I nodded. “Wouldn’t miss it, and thank you for trusting me with her.”\n Marcus smiled. “You are my best man. Who better to trust her with?”\n I grinned and headed out the door. Amanda was already out here somewhere waiting on me, and I was more than anxious to get her alone.\n Two hands reached out of the shadows and wrapped around my arm, tugging me into the darkness.\n “You weren’t very nice in there,” Amanda scolded before kissing my neck and running her hands up my chest.\n “I was on my best behavior,” I replied, grabbing the bottom of this ridiculous excuse for a dress and pulling it up so I could run my hands over her ass again. She was wearing a fucking thong. I’d made that discovery on the beach earlier, and it had driven me crazy every time I looked down at her ass in this dress.\n “No, you were a bad boy. I’m surprised Jason toughed it out as long as he did.” She bit down on my earlobe and raised her bare leg up my side. I grabbed her under the knee and pulled it higher.\n “He was too close to you, and you don’t have on a bra. Manda, you have got to start wearing a bra, baby. I’m gonna get arrested if you don’t.”\n She giggled and reached up to pull the straps of her dress down until her breasts were bare.\n “Fuck, baby. I’ve got to get you back to my apartment. Now. Real fast.” I bent down to flick her erect nipples with my tongue.\n “Mmmmm, I can’t wait that long, and we have to be here to see them off,” she moaned, pressing my head closer to her nipple until I pulled it into my mouth and sucked.\n I wasn’t going to be able to wait that long either at this rate. It had been too long since I’d touched her. I was ready to be buried up in her, and this time I might not ever come out.\n “Preston,” she panted.\n “Yes, baby?”\n “Go down the beach that way. There are no houses, and it’s dark and empty. I need you right now.” She was pointing off into the darkness.\n She wanted to have sex on a beach? Hell, yes.\n I slipped the straps of her dress back up her arms and covered her tits back up, then grabbed her hand and led her out deeper into the darkness. We walked until the music and laughter from the house had faded away and there was no sound other than the waves..\n Amanda pushed at my chest when I tried to pull her against me, and she reached for the button on my pants. There was a wicked gleam in her eyes as she looked up at me. She got the button undone and unzipped them, then pulled down my pants and my boxer briefs. I slipped off my shoes and stepped out of them. My girl wanted me naked, so I was going to oblige her.\n She placed both her hands on my thighs and stuck out her tongue and took a swipe at my dick. Holy shit.\n “Manda, baby . . . Ohgod.” She wrapped a hand around the base of my cock, then covered it with her mouth.\n “Baby, AH, you . . . OH, Manda, God, that feels incredible.” I gave up trying to stop her. I couldn’t form words. I reached down and buried my hands in her hair, and watched in delirious pleasure as she slid my dick in and out of her mouth like it was a damn Popsicle and she couldn’t get enough.\n “Holy . . . fuck. UH, yeah. That’s it. So good.” She sucked harder when I praised her. If I wasn’t about to explode, I’d keep on talking, but I needed to get her sweet, hot little mouth off my cock and get inside her.\n I reached down and pulled her up. The popping noise her mouth made when my dick sprang free might go down as one of the hottest sounds ever.\n “I don’t want to stop,” she said with a pout, trying to go back down on her knees.\n “I was about to lose it right there in your sexy-as-hell mouth, and I didn’t want to do that. I wanted to lose it in you.”\n Amanda made a cute little O with her mouth, and I reached under her dress to rid her of her panties. I threw them aside, and she laughed at yet another torn pair of her little sexy underwear. I was going to go buy her some more tomorrow. We were gonna need them.\n I slipped a finger into her, thinking I needed to get her ready, when my hand met wet heat. “You liked giving me head, didn’t you?” I asked in wonder as she trembled against my hand, more than wet enough for me. “That’s so damn hot,” I whispered, lowering my mouth to capture hers. She was turned on and ready for me just by sucking my damn cock. Shit. This woman owned me. I’d be her slave for life. I just couldn’t lose her again.\n Amanda\n Preston unzipped my dress and let it drop to the sand below us, and I kicked it aside. He reached for his pants and pulled out his wallet and a small foil packet. I watched as he tore it open with his teeth then slid the condom down over himself. His white teeth bit into his bottom lip as he worked to get the protection in place.\n “I’m gonna lie down, and I want you to get on top of me. Just like you rode me on the couch.” He pulled his shirt off, then lay down on the sand, and I stepped over him and lowered myself on him.\n “Ah, damn, I’m not gonna last,” he breathed as I placed my hands on his chest and let him guide his erection into me. I was more than ready for him. As soon as he had it in place, I sank down on him and we both cried out from the pleasure of it. I’d missed him so much. This time knowing he loved me. It changed everything.\n We dusted the sand off the best we could and fixed each other’s hair before we headed back to the house. We could see people piling out of the front doors as we approached. We’d made it back just in time.\n “You want to go in first so your mom doesn’t see us?”\n No. I didn’t. I wanted to walk in there holding Preston Drake’s hand and daring her to say anything about it. Was she really going to tell everyone about his past? Because I wasn’t going to leave him, so they’d all know that her daughter was dating a former gigolo. I wasn’t so sure my mom was that self-destructive. Her social circle would eat that information up. Also, she’d have to rat the mayor’s wife out, and that would cause all kinds of drama.\n “I want to walk in there holding your hand. I’m tired of hiding things because I’m scared of my mom’s reaction. She is going to be against this, but I don’t care. She’ll learn to live with it. And once she’s around you for any amount of time, she’s going to be charmed. You have that way about you. It is impossible for a female to not like you.”\n Preston pulled me up against his chest and cupped my face in his hands. “I love you. I love you so damn much it consumes me. I don’t deserve you, but I’m gonna become the man who does deserve you. I promise you. I’ll make you proud of me.”\n I reached up and ran my thumb over his lips. “I am and will always be proud of you. I want the world to know you’re mine.” \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/just-for-now-sea-breeze-4/page-28.html","bookId":1988,"book":{"id":1988,"title":"Just for Now (Sea Breeze #4)","description":"Storyline: \n Just for Now (Sea Breeze #4) \n The day Preston Drake figured out that wealthy women paid well for a set of tight abs and a pretty face his life turned around. \n The run down rat-infested trailer he had shared with his alcoholic mother and three younger siblings was now only a place he visited to pay the bills and stock the pantry with food. \n He no longer worried about his family starving or living without electricity.
