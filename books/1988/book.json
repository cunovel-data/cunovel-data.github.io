{"id":1988,"title":"Just for Now (Sea Breeze #4)","description":"Storyline: \n Just for Now (Sea Breeze #4) \n The day Preston Drake figured out that wealthy women paid well for a set of tight abs and a pretty face his life turned around. \n The run down rat-infested trailer he had shared with his alcoholic mother and three younger siblings was now only a place he visited to pay the bills and stock the pantry with food. \n He no longer worried about his family starving or living without electricity. The money he made entertaining rich older women more than covered his family’s needs and his own. He had it all figured out. Except… \n There was this girl. \n She was as innocent as he was tainted. \n Amanda Hardy wished her knees didn’t get weak when Preston walked into a room. She hated the fact her heart raced when he flashed his smile in her direction. He had a different girl in his bed every night. He was the kind of boy a smart girl ran from. So, why was she coming up with ways to get close to him? Even when it was obvious he wanted to keep her at a distance. \n Maybe her heart knew something the world didn’t. Maybe Preston Drake was more than just a pretty face.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/just-for-now-sea-breeze-4.jpg","author":"Abbi Glines","type":"Young Adult","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":28,"category":{"id":9,"name":"Young Adult","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
