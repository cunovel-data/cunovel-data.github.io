{"id":93886,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"Kaitlyn looked from Anna\u0027s mother to Anna\u0027s father, a grave man with steady eyes who\u0027d scarcely spoken during dinner. The kitchen was warm and quiet. Yellow light shone from the overhead lamp onto unfinished pine cupboards. Then Kaitlyn looked at Rob. They were all looking at one another, all five who shared the web. Should we? Anna asked. Yes, Kaitlyn thought back, feeling agreement from the others. But only your parents. Not... Anna waved a hand at her twin brothers. \"You guys go play, okay? And...\" She glanced at Lydia and faltered. Kaitlyn knew the problem; Anna was gentle by nature, and it was difficult to say \"get out\" to a guest who\u0027d just eaten at the same table. You\u0027re too soft-hearted, she thought, but Gabriel was already speaking. \"Maybe Lydia and I could take a walk outside,\" he said. \"It\u0027s stopped raining now.\" Standing, he looked every inch the gallant gentleman - if you didn\u0027t count the mocking glint in his eyes. He extended his hand to Lydia courteously. There wasn\u0027t much Lydia could do. She went rather pale, so that her three freckles stood out more prominently. Then she thanked Anna\u0027s parents and took Gabriel\u0027s hand. Lewis gave her a hurt look. Be careful, Kaitlyn thought to Gabriel as he and Lydia walked out. Of what? Psychic attacks - or her? he sent back, amused. Anna\u0027s brothers went, too. And then there was no further excuse for delay. With one final look at her mind-mates, Anna took a deep breath and began telling her parents the whole story. Almost the whole story. She left out some of the more gruesome bits and didn\u0027t mention the mind-link at all. But she told about Marisol, and the crystal that enhanced psychic power, and Mr. Zetes\u0027s plans for making his students into a psychic strike team. Rob went and got the files he\u0027d taken from the hidden room. \"And we\u0027ve been having these dreams,\" Anna said. \"About a little peninsula with gray water all around it, and across from it is a cliff with trees and a white house. And we think that the people in the house might be sending us the dreams, trying to help us.\" She told about Kaitlyn\u0027s two encounters with the caramel-skinned man who came from the white house. \"He didn\u0027t seem to like the Institute,\" Kait put in. \"And he showed me a picture of a garden with a huge crystal in it - like Mr. Z\u0027s crystal. We figure that maybe they know about these things.\" Mrs. Whiteraven frowned. Her black eyes had been snapping and flashing throughout Anna\u0027s story, especially when Anna told about Mr. Z\u0027s plans. Mr. Whiteraven had merely gotten more and more grave-looking, one of his hands slowly clenching into a fist. Like Tony, they seemed to have no trouble accepting the reality of what Anna was saying. Now Anna\u0027s mother spoke. \"But - you\u0027re saying you set out for this white house without any idea where it is?\" \"We have some idea,\" Anna said. \"It\u0027s north. And we\u0027ll know it when we see it - the peninsula is lined with these strange rock piles. I keep thinking they\u0027re familiar somehow. They look like this.\" She got a pencil and began drawing on the back of one of the file folders. \"No - Kait, you\u0027re the artist. Draw one.\" Kaitlyn did her best, sketching one of the tall, irregular rock stacks. It came out looking a bit like a stone snowman with outspread arms. \"Oh, it\u0027s an inuk shuk,\" Mrs. Whiteraven said. Kaitlyn\u0027s head jerked up. \"You recognize it?\" Anna\u0027s mother turned the paper, studying it. \"Yes - I\u0027m sure it\u0027s an inuk shuk. The Inuit used them for signals, you know, to show that a certain place was friendly or that visitors were welcome - \" \"The Inuit?\" Anna interrupted, choking. \"You mean we have to go to Alaska?\" Her mother waved a hand, brow puckering. \"I\u0027m sure I\u0027ve seen some of these much closer... I know! It was somewhere on Vancouver Island. We took a trip there when you were about five or six. Yes, and I\u0027m sure we saw them there.\" Everyone began talking at once. \"Vancouver Island - that\u0027s Canada - \" Rob said. \"Yes, but it\u0027s not far - there\u0027s a ferry,\" Anna said. \"No wonder those things were familiar - \" \"I\u0027ve never been to Canada,\" said Lewis. \"But do you remember exactly where they were?\" Kaitlyn was asking Mrs. Whiteraven. \"No, dear, I\u0027m afraid not. It was a long time ago.\" Anna\u0027s mother chewed her lip gently, frowning at the picture. Then she sighed and shook her head. \"It doesn\u0027t matter,\" Rob said. His eyes were alight with excitement. \"At least we know the general area. And somebody on the island has got to know where they are. We\u0027ll just keep asking.\" Anna\u0027s mother put the paper down. \"Now, just a minute,\" she said. She and her husband exchanged a glance. Kaitlyn, looking from one of them to the other, had a sudden sinking feeling. \"Now,\" Mrs. Whiteraven said, turning away from her husband. \"You kids have been very brave and resourceful so far. But this idea about finding the white house - it\u0027s not practical. This isn\u0027t a problem for children.\" \"No,\" said Mr. Whiteraven. He\u0027d been looking through the files Rob had brought. \"It\u0027s a problem for the authorities. There\u0027s enough proof here to get your Mr. Zetes put away for a long time.\" \"But you don\u0027t understand how powerful he is,\" Anna said. \"He\u0027s got friends everywhere. And Marisol\u0027s brother said that only magic could fight magic - \" \"I hardly think Marisol\u0027s brother is an expert,\" her mother said tartly. \"You should have gone to your parents in the first place. And that reminds me, you have to call your parents, now - all of you.\" Kait hardened herself. \"We can\u0027t tell them anything that would make them feel better. And if Mr. Zetes has some way of tapping the call - well, he\u0027d know exactly where we are.\" \"If he doesn\u0027t already,\" Anna said softly. \"But...\" Mrs. Whiteraven sighed and exchanged another look with her husband. \"All right, I\u0027ll call them in the morning. I don\u0027t need to tell them exactly where you are until we get this thing straightened out.\" \"Straightened out how, ma\u0027am?\" Rob asked. His eyes had darkened. \"We\u0027ll talk to the elders, then to the police,\" Anna\u0027s mother said firmly. \"That\u0027s the right thing to do.\" Anna opened her mouth, then shut it again. It\u0027s no good, she told the others helplessly. No. It isn\u0027t, Rob agreed. Lewis said, Jeeeez. I guess we should be relieved, but - Kaitlyn knew what he meant. Adults were in the picture now, taking charge, handling things. The authorities were going to be told. The five of them didn\u0027t have to worry anymore. She should have been happy. So why did her chest feel so tight? Two thoughts jostled in her brain. One was: After we got so far... The other was: The adults don\u0027t know Mr. Z. \"Now we\u0027ll have to find places for you to sleep,\" Anna\u0027s mother was saying briskly. \"You two boys can have the twins\u0027 room, and I\u0027ll put your friend Gabriel on the couch. Then Anna can share her room with you, Kait, and Lydia can go in the guest room - \" \" Lydia\u0027s not sleeping here,\" Kaitlyn blurted, before thinking about how rude this sounded. \"She\u0027s not one of us; she just gave us a ride.\" Mrs. Whiteraven looked surprised. \"Well, you can\u0027t expect her to drive all the way home now. It\u0027s too late, and she told me before dinner that she was tired. I\u0027ve already invited her to stay overnight.\" Kaitlyn started to groan, then realized that Rob and Anna and especially Lewis were looking at her reproachfully. In the web she could feel their bewilderment - they didn\u0027t understand what she had against Lydia. Oh, well, what difference did it make anyway? Kait shrugged and bent her head. Gabriel and Lydia came strolling through the door a few minutes later. Lydia didn\u0027t look particularly disappointed to have missed the kitchen conference. She kept glancing up at Gabriel through her lashes - a stratagem that seemed to amuse Gabriel and annoy Lewis. Kait and Anna left Rob to fill Gabriel in on what had happened while they helped make up the guest room bed. So the quest is over? Gabriel asked. Kaitlyn could hear him perfectly even though he was in the kitchen and she was giving a final punch to Lydia\u0027s pillow. We\u0027ll talk about it tomorrow, she told him grimly. She was tired. And she was worried about Gabriel. Again. Still. She could tell that he was in pain - she could feel the tension shimmering under his surface. But somehow she didn\u0027t think he was going to let her help tonight. He didn\u0027t. He wouldn\u0027t talk about it, either, not even when she managed to sneak a moment alone with him while the others were getting ready for bed. \"But what are you going to do?\" She had dreadful visions of him sneaking into Anna\u0027s parents\u0027 room, too crazed to know what he was doing. \"Nothing,\" he said shortly, and then, with icy fury, \"I\u0027m a guest here.\" So he\u0027d caught her vision. And he had his own code of honor. But that didn\u0027t mean he could hold out all night... He was already walking away. Kaitlyn climbed into Anna\u0027s double bed feeling uneasy and discouraged. It was just dawn when she woke. She found herself staring at the luminous green numbers on Anna\u0027s clock radio, a knot twisting in her stomach. She could sense the others sleeping - even Gabriel. He was so restless that she could tell he hadn\u0027t been out anywhere. Strangely, of all the things she had to worry about, the one bothering her was Lydia. Forget Lydia, she told herself. But her mind kept spinning out the same questions. Who was Lydia, and why was she so eager to be with them? What was wrong with the girl? And why did Kait keep feeling she wasn\u0027t to be trusted? There should be some way to tell, Kait thought. Some test or something... Kait sat up. Then, quickly but as stealthily as possible, she slid out of bed and picked up her duffel bag. She took the bag into the bathroom and locked the door. With the light on she fished through the bag until she found her art kit. The sealed Tupperware had survived the creek, and her pastels and erasers were safe. The sketchpad was damp, though. Oh, well. Oill pastels didn\u0027t mind the damp. Kaitlyn picked up a black pastel stick, held it poised over the blank page, and shut her eyes. She\u0027d never done this before; trying to make a picture come when she didn\u0027t already feel the need to draw. Now she made use of some of Joyce\u0027s techniques, deliberately relaxing and shutting out the world. Clear your mind. Now think of Lydia. Think of drawing Lydia... Let the picture come... Black lines radiating downward. Kaitlyn saw the image and let her hand transfer it to the paper. Now some black grape mixed in. Blue for highlights - it was Lydia\u0027s hair. Then pale fleshtones for Lydia\u0027s face and celadon green for Lydia\u0027s eyes. But she felt she needed the black again. Heavy strokes of black, lots of them, above and around Lydia\u0027s portrait, forming a silhouette that seemed to be cradling Lydia, encompassing her. Kaitlyn\u0027s eyes opened all the way, and she stared at the drawing. That broad-shouldered silhouette with body lines that swept straight down like a man in a coat... In one furious motion she was on her feet. I\u0027ll kill her. Oh, my God, I\u0027m going to kill her... She jerked open the bathroom door and headed for the guest room. Lydia was a slender shape under the covers. Kait turned her over and grabbed her by the throat. Lydia made a noise like Georgie Mouse. Her eyes showed white in the darkness. \"You nasty, spying, sneaking little weasel,\" Kait said and shook her a few times. She spoke softly, so as not to wake Anna\u0027s parents, and put most of her energy into the shaking. Lydia made more noises. Kaitlyn thought she was trying to say, \"What are you talking about?\" \"I\u0027ll tell you what I\u0027m talking about,\" she said, punctuating each word with a shake. Lydia was gripping her wrists with both hands, but was too weak to break Kait\u0027s hold. \"You\u0027re working for Mr. Zetes, you little worm.\" Squeaking feebly, Lydia tried to shake her head. \"Yes, you are! I know it. I\u0027m psychic, remember?\" As Kaitlyn finished speaking, she sensed activity behind her. It was her mind-mates, crowding in the doorway. So much emotion, so close, had gotten through to all of them even in their sleep. \"Hey! What are you doing?\" Lewis was saying in alarm, and Rob said, \"Kait, what\u0027s happening? You woke everybody up...\" Kaitlyn barely turned. \"She\u0027s a spy!\" \"What?\" Charming in too-big pajamas, Rob came to stand beside the bed. When he saw Kaitlyn\u0027s grip on Lydia\u0027s throat, he reached instinctively. Lewis was right behind him. \"Don\u0027t, you guys. She\u0027s a spy - aren\u0027t you?\" Kaitlyn tried to bang Lydia\u0027s head against the headboard, but didn\u0027t have enough leverage. \"Hey!\" \"Kait, just calm down - \" \"Admit it!\" Kait told the struggling Lydia. \"Admit it and I\u0027ll let you go!\" Just as Rob was putting his arms around Kait, trying to pull her away, Lydia nodded. Kaitlyn let go. \"I did a drawing that showed she\u0027s working for Mr. Zetes,\" she said to Rob. To Lydia, she added, \"Tell them!\" Lydia was coughing and choking, trying to get enough air. Finally she managed to wheeze, \"I\u0027m a spy.\" Rob dropped his arms, and Lewis looked almost comically dismayed. \"What?\" A wave of ugly emotion came from Gabriel. Images of Lydia being chopped into little pieces and thrown in the ocean. Kaitlyn winced and for the first time realized that her hands were sore. The others had gathered around the bed now. Anna was somber, and Lewis looked hurt and betrayed. Rob crossed his arms over his chest. \"All right,\" he said to Lydia. \"Start talking.\" Lydia sat up, small and ghostly in her white nightgown. She looked at each of the five rather threatening figures surrounding her bed. \"I am a spy,\" she said. \"But I\u0027m not working for Mr. Zetes.\" \"Oh, come off it,\" Kaitlyn said, and Gabriel said, \"Of course you\u0027re not,\" in his silkiest, most sinister manner. \"I\u0027m not. I don\u0027t work for him... I\u0027m his daughter.\" Kaitlyn felt her jaw sag. Unbelievable - but, wait. Joyce had mentioned that Mr. Zetes had a daughter... She said the daughter was friends with Marisol, Rob agreed. Kaitlyn remembered. She also remembered thinking that any daughter of Mr. Zetes\u0027s would have to be old, strangely old to be friends with Marisol. \"How old are you?\" she said suspiciously to Lydia. \"Eighteen last month. Look, if you don\u0027t believe me, my driver\u0027s license is in my purse.\" Gabriel picked a black Chanel purse off the floor and dumped its contents on the bed, ignoring Lydia\u0027s murmur of protest. He extracted a wallet. \"Lydia Zetes,\" he said, and showed the driver\u0027s license to the others. \"How did you get here?\" Rob demanded. Lydia blinked and swallowed. She was either on the verge of tears or an excellent actress, Kaitlyn thought. \"I flew. On a plane.\" \"The astral plane?\" Gabriel asked. He was very angry. \"On a jet,\" Lydia said. \"My father sent me, and I got the car from a friend of his, a director of Boeing. My father called and told me where you\u0027d be - \" \"Which he knew because he set up a trap for us,\" Rob interrupted, seizing on this. \"A trap with a goat. He knew if we didn\u0027t get killed in the accident, we\u0027d be stranded - \" \"Yes. And I was supposed to come along and help you - if any of you were still alive.\" \"You - little - \" Words failed Kaitlyn. She grabbed for Lydia\u0027s throat again, but Gabriel was faster. \"Don\u0027t bother with it. I\u0027ll take care of her,\" he said. Kaitlyn sensed cold hunger. Everyone in the web knew what he meant. The interesting thing was that Lydia seemed to know what he meant, too. She flinched, scooting back against the headboard. \"You don\u0027t understand! I\u0027m not your enemy,\" she said in a voice laced with raw panic. \"Sure you\u0027re not,\" Lewis said. \"No, you\u0027re just his daughter,\" said Kaitlyn. Then she felt Anna\u0027s hand on her arm. \"Wait a minute,\" Anna said quietly. \"At least let her say what she wants to.\" To Lydia, she said, softly but severely, \"Go on.\" Lydia gulped and addressed herself to Anna. \"I know you won\u0027t believe me, but what I told you in the car was true. I do hate private school, and riding clubs, and country clubs. And I hate my father. All I ever wanted was to get away - \" \"Yeah, yeah,\" Lewis said. Gabriel just laughed. \"It\u0027s true,\" Lydia said fiercely. \"I hate what he does to people. I didn\u0027t want to come after you, but it was my only chance.\" Something about her voice made Lewis falter in his sneering. Kaitlyn could feel his indecision in the web. \"You weren\u0027t going to tell us, though, were you?\" Kaitlyn said. \"You\u0027d never have told us who you were if I hadn\u0027t found out.\" \"I was going to,\" Lydia said. She squirmed. \"I wanted to,\" she amended. \"But I knew you wouldn\u0027t believe me.\" \"Oh, stop sniveling,\" Gabriel said. Kaitlyn was looking at Rob. I know I\u0027m going to hate myself for asking this - but do you think it could be true? I. . . don\u0027t know. Rob grinned suddenly. But maybe we can find out. He sat on the bed, taking Lydia by the shoulders, and looked into her face. She shrank back. \"Now listen to me,\" he said sternly. \"You know that we\u0027re psychics, right? Well, Kaitlyn has the power to tell if you\u0027re lying or not.\" To Kait he said, Go get your drawing stuff. Kaitlyn hid a smile and brought it from the bathroom. Rob went on, \"All she has to do is make a drawing. And if that drawing says you\u0027re not telling the truth...\" He shook his head darkly. \"Now,\" he said, looking hard at Lydia again, \"what\u0027s your story this time?\" Lydia looked at Kait, then at Rob. She lifted her chin. \"It\u0027s the same. Everything I told you was true,\" she said steadily. Kaitlyn made a few scribbles on the pad. Her gift didn\u0027t work that way, of course, but she knew that the real test here was of Lydia\u0027s demeanor. Well? she asked Rob. Either she\u0027s telling the truth or she\u0027s the greatest actress in the world. Like Joyce? Gabriel put in pointedly. You know, I could probably tell if she\u0027s telling the truth. I could mind-link with her. Yeah, but what are the chances that she\u0027d survive? Rob asked. Gabriel shrugged. The hunger flickered again. \"Look, what was it you were supposed to do when you found us?\" Kaitlyn asked Lydia. \"Keep you guys from going wherever you were going,\" she said promptly. \"Convince you to go to the police or something instead - \" \"He wants that? Your father?\" \"Oh, yes. He knows he can fix the police. He\u0027s got lots of friends, and he can do things with the crystal. He\u0027s not afraid of police; he\u0027s afraid of them.\" \"Who?\" Kaitlyn demanded. \"Them. The people of the crystal. He doesn\u0027t know where they are, but he\u0027s afraid you\u0027ll find them. They\u0027re the only ones who can stop him.\" She looked around. \" Now do you believe me? Would I have told you that if I were your enemy?\" Kaitlyn could feel the wavering in the web, and the sudden resolution. Rob and Anna believed her. Lewis not only believed her but liked her again. Gabriel was cynical, but that was typical Gabriel. And Kait herself was convinced enough to have a new worry. \"If Mr. Z wants us to go to the police - \" she began. \"Right,\" Rob said grimly. \"But we\u0027ll never convince my parents,\" Anna said. \"Right,\" Rob said again. A feeling was stirring in Kaitlyn, part terror, part dismay, and part wild excitement. Lewis gulped. \"But that means - \" \"Right,\" Rob said a third time. He grinned at Kait, his grin reflecting her bewildering mix of emotions. \"The search,\" he announced to the room at large, \"is back on.\" Gabriel cursed. Lydia was looking from one of them to another in bewilderment. \"I don\u0027t understand.\" \"It means we\u0027re going to have to run away again,\" Rob said. \"And if you really want to help us - \" \"I do.\" \" - you can drive us to Vancouver Island. There\u0027s a ferry, right?\" He glanced at Anna, who nodded. \"I\u0027ll do it,\" Lydia said simply. \"When do we go?\" \"Right now,\" Kaitlyn said. \"We\u0027ve got to get out of here before Anna\u0027s parents wake up.\" \"Okay, everybody,\" Rob said. \"Grab your things and let\u0027s get moving.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-possessed-dark-visions-2/page-11.html","bookId":2125,"book":{"id":2125,"title":"The Possessed (Dark Visions #2)","description":"Storyline: The Possessed (Dark Visions #2) The bestselling author of The Forbidden Game brings readers the second volume in her all-new horror trilogy, Dark Visions.
