{"id":93877,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"Kaitlyn looked back. Mr. Zetes. Light from the porch shone behind him so he appeared as a dark silhouette, but somehow Kait could still see his face. When she\u0027d first come to the Institute a week ago, she\u0027d thought that Mr. Z was a handsome, aristocratic old gentleman - like Little Lord Fauntleroy\u0027s grandfather. Now she knew the truth, and the leonine head with its shock of white hair appeared completely evil to her. Those piercing dark eyes seemed to burn like - Like a demon\u0027s, Kaitlyn thought. Except he\u0027s not a demon, just an insane genius, and we\u0027ve got to get out of here... They were all paralyzed. Even Gabriel, who was in front of Kaitlyn now that she had turned around, closer to Mr. Zetes. Something about the man stopped them all dead, drained the will out of them. They were held by pure fear. Don\u0027t look at him, Rob\u0027s voice said in Kaitlyn\u0027s mind, but it was faint and distant. The terror reverberating in the web was much stronger. \"Come here,\" Mr. Zetes said. His voice was strong and rich and utterly commanding. He stepped forward and Kaitlyn could see him more clearly in the living room lights. There was blood in his thick white hair and on his starched shirt collar. Gabriel\u0027s mental attack had done that, knocked him out, made him bleed. But Gabriel was exhausted now... As if he were part of the web and could hear her thoughts, Mr. Zetes said, \"You\u0027re all tired. I don\u0027t think you can use your powers any further tonight. Why don\u0027t we sit down and talk together?\" Kait had been too frightened to speak, but this struck fire in her. \"We don\u0027t have anything to talk about,\" she said caustically. \"Your futures,\" Mr. Zetes said. \"Your lives. I realize that I was too harsh earlier tonight. It was a shock to find you\u0027d gotten yourselves into a permanent telepathic link. But I still think we can work together. We\u0027ll find another way to break the link - \" \"You mean besides killing one of us?\" Kaitlyn snarled. Don\u0027t stick around and argue with him, Gabriel said, his cold mental voice cutting through the thrumming fear in the web. You four go - start heading for the back door. I\u0027ll keep him here. \"No,\" Kaitlyn said aloud, before she could help it. Even in the middle of this danger, she felt a wash of emotion. Gabriel, who\u0027d always claimed he didn\u0027t care about anybody, was risking himself to protect them... And he was moving now, putting himself directly between her and Mr. Zetes. Once she could no longer see Mr. Zetes\u0027s face, she felt her paralysis break. But we can\u0027t leave you, she told Gabriel. You nearly died once tonight already - Gabriel didn\u0027t glance back. His posture was wolf-like, his attention fixed on Mr. Zetes. Kessler, get them out. I\u0027ll handle the old man. But Rob\u0027s mental voice was sharp. No! None of us can stay. Don\u0027t you see, he wants to keep us here - and we haven\u0027t seen Joyce yet. The instant he said it, Kaitlyn knew he was right. It was a trap. \"Come on!\" she shouted, both mentally and aloud - but even as she was shouting it, a shape appeared in the kitchen doorway beside her. Hands grabbed for her. \"Let me go!\" Kait found herself kicking and screaming. Other shouts hurt her ears. All she could see was the venomous, twisted face in front of her. Joyce Piper\u0027s sleek blond hair was plastered flat to her head with sweat and blood. Dried rivulets ran down her cheeks. Her aquamarine eyes were full of heated poison, and her lips were drawn back. Oh, God, she wants to kill me; she really wants to kill me. I trusted her and she\u0027s crazy, she\u0027s as crazy as Mr. Zetes is - Hands were pulling her away from Joyce, shoving her toward the back of the house. Rob\u0027s voice rose over the background shouting. \"Run, Kaitlyn! Go! Everybody run!\" Looking back, Kaitlyn had a brief glimpse of Rob and Gabriel grappling with Joyce, of Mr. Zetes coming toward them, his face suffused with fury. Then she was running, with Lewis and Anna jostling around her. She didn\u0027t realize she still had her duffel bag until she got to the back door and had to put it down to undo the locks. She yanked the door open - and there was Mr. Zetes\u0027s chauffeur. Looking immovable as a mountain, blocking the way. Get him! Kaitlyn wasn\u0027t sure who shouted it, but she and Anna and Lewis were all moving at once. It was as if they suddenly had only one mind, divided into three bodies. Lewis put his head down and ran at the man\u0027s stomach; Kait swung her duffel bag at his face; Anna slammed a foot into his shin. He toppled over and they ran on, stampeding toward the green convertible in the driveway. It was Joyce\u0027s car, the car they\u0027d taken from Mr. Zetes\u0027s mansion to get back to the Institute. The keys were still inside. \"Get in the back,\" Kaitlyn told Lewis and Anna, throwing her duffel bag into the backseat. Rob! Gabriel! Get out here! Come on; we\u0027re ready for you! She twisted the key in the ignition, yanked at the gearshift, and turned the wheel hard. She wasn\u0027t a very good driver - she hadn\u0027t had much practice back in Ohio - but now she sent gravel flying as she swung the convertible in a tight arc on the driveway. \"Headlights - \" Lewis gasped. Kait reached down blindly and wrenched a dial. The blaze of light illuminated the chauffeur, who was on his feet again in front of them. Kaitlyn headed right toward him. She could hear yelling, but everything seemed to be happening in slow motion. The chauffeur\u0027s mouth was open. For endless seconds the car kept getting closer and closer to him, and then suddenly he was diving sideways. He got out of the way just as Rob and Gabriel burst through the back door. Get in! Kait hit the brake, jolting the car. Rob and Gabriel scrambled in, climbing over Lewis and Anna. Kaitlyn didn\u0027t wait for them to untangle themselves; she put her foot on the accelerator and pressed - hard. Go, she was thinking - or maybe it was somebody else thinking it, she couldn\u0027t tell. Go, go, go, go. Tires squealed as she reached the street, turned, and sped away from the purple house that was the Zetes Institute for Psychic Research. It was a great relief to be moving this fast. She overshot stop signs, shrieked around corners. She didn\u0027t know where she was going, just that she had to get as far away as possible. \"Kait.\" It was Rob\u0027s voice. Rob was in the front seat beside her, an armful of folders clutched to his chest. He put a hand on her arm. Kait. Kaitlyn was breathing hard and shivering - a fine all-over tremor. She\u0027d reached Ell Camino Real, the main street in San Carlos. She ran a red light. Kait, ease up. We got away. It\u0027s all right. His fingers tightened on her arm, and he repeated, \"It\u0027s all right.\" Kaitlyn felt her breath come out more slowly. She was able to ease her grip on the steering wheel. \"Are you guys okay?\" \"Yeah,\" Rob said. \"Gabriel knocked them out again. They\u0027re both lying unconscious in the lab.\" He turned to look into the backseat. \"Nice going.\" \"Oh, glad you thought so,\" Gabriel said in a voice as cold as Rob\u0027s had been warm. But through the web, Kaitlyn could feel Gabriel\u0027s desperate tiredness. She sensed a rush of concern from Rob and knew he felt it, too. \"Look,\" he said, \"you\u0027re wiped out. Do you want me to - \" No, Gabriel said flatly. Kaitlyn\u0027s heart sank. Just an hour or so ago Gabriel had been willing to accept Rob\u0027s help - all their help. Back at the mansion he\u0027d let Rob use his healing power, let him channel energy from the rest of them to save Gabriel\u0027s life. Gabriel had come to trust all of them, when he\u0027d never trusted anyone before. They\u0027d actually gotten through to him, broken down the walls. And now... Gabriel was reverting again. Shutting them out, pretending he wasn\u0027t part of them. And there was nothing they could do about it. Kaitlyn gave it a try anyway. Sometimes Gabriel seemed to... respect her more than the others, or at least he listened to her opinions more. \"You\u0027ve got to keep your strength up,\" she began lightly, trying to catch his eye in the rearview mirror. He cut her off with a terse, Leave me alone. Kait got an image of walls, high walls with nasty spikes sticking out of them. Gabriel trying to cover his vulnerability. She knew what he wouldn\u0027t verbalize, that he didn\u0027t want to be indebted to Rob ever again. Anna\u0027s quiet voice broke into her thoughts. \"Where are we going?\" \"I don\u0027t know.\" It was a good question and Kait\u0027s heart started pounding again. \"You guys, where can we go?\" She could sense consternation all around her. None of them except Lewis was familiar with the San Francisco area. \"Well - jeeez,\" Lewis said. \"Okay, we don\u0027t want to go into the city, right? My parents live up in Pacific Heights, but - \" \"But that\u0027s the first place Mr. Z will look,\" Rob said. \"No, we agreed before, we can\u0027t go to our parents. We\u0027ll only get them in trouble, too.\" \"The truth is,\" Gabriel began, \"we don\u0027t know where we\u0027re going - \" \"It doesn\u0027t matter,\" Kaitlyn interrupted him. \"It doesn\u0027t matter where we\u0027re going eventually. What we need to figure out is what to do now. It\u0027s two a.m. and it\u0027s dark and it\u0027s cold and Mr. Zetes is going to be after us...\" \"You\u0027re right about that,\" Gabriel said. \"And he\u0027ll have the police after us, too, when he wakes up from being knocked out. We\u0027re in a stolen car.\" \"Then we\u0027d better get away from San Carlos fast,\" Lewis said, alarm sharpening his voice. \"There\u0027s Highway 101, Kait. Get on it going north.\" Kaitlyn clenched her teeth and got on the freeway, which was a big one, five lanes in each direction. She knew the others must be aware of how nervous she was, but no one mentioned it. \"Now, let\u0027s see... we don\u0027t want to go to San Francisco... Okay, take the San Mateo bridge there, and when you get across, go on 880 north. That\u0027s the East Bay; you know, Hayward and Oakland.\" The bridge started out wide but narrowed to a ribbon of concrete that seemed to barely clear dark water. In a few minutes they were cruising up another freeway. \"Good job,\" Rob said softly, and Kaitlyn felt a flash of warmth. \"Now, don\u0027t speed too much; we don\u0027t want to draw attention to ourselves.\" Kaitlyn nodded and kept the red hand of the speedometer quivering just below sixty miles per hour. They hadn\u0027t been driving two minutes before Lewis said, \"Uh-oh.\" \"What \u0027uh-oh?\u0027\" Kaitlyn asked tightly. \"There\u0027s a car behind us with antlers,\" Anna said. \"Antlers?\" \"Police light bar,\" Lewis said. His voice was thin. Rob stayed calm. \"Don\u0027t panic. They won\u0027t pull you over for going three miles over the speed limit, and Mr. Z probably isn\u0027t even awake yet...\" Lights sprang to life on the roof of the car behind Kaitlyn. Blue and yellow flashing lights. Kaitlyn\u0027s stomach plunged as if she\u0027d stepped into an elevator. Her heart had begun a sick pounding. \"Can we panic now?\" Lewis gasped. \"I thought you said Mr. Z wouldn\u0027t be awake yet.\" \"We forgot,\" Anna said. \"He had plenty of time to call the police and report the car stolen back at the mansion. When he first woke up.\" Kait had a wild impulse to run. She\u0027d run from the police a time or two back in Ohio, mainly when they wanted her to make some prediction about a case they were working on. But that had been on foot, out in the farmland that surrounded Thoroughfare - and she hadn\u0027t been a criminal then. Now she was in a stolen car, and she\u0027d just helped assault three grown-ups. And you\u0027ve got me in the car, and I\u0027m violating my parole, Gabriel\u0027s voice said in her mind. Remember? I\u0027m not supposed to leave the Institute except to go to school. \"Oh, God,\" Kaitlyn said aloud. She gripped the wheel with palms that were slick with sweat. The need to run, to jam on the accelerator and get out of here, was swelling in her like a balloon. \"No,\" Rob said urgently. \"We won\u0027t be able to get away from them, and the last thing we want is a high-speed chase.\" \"Then what do we do, Rob?\" Anna asked. \"Pull over.\" Rob looked at Kait. \"Pull over and we\u0027ll talk to them. I\u0027ll show them this.\" He hefted the files. \"And if they take us to the police station, I\u0027ll show it to everyone there.\" Kaitlyn felt a surge of incredulity from Gabriel. \"Are you joking? How naive are you, Kessler? Do you think anybody is going to believe five kids - especially any cop - \" He broke off. When he spoke again, it was in a different voice, taut and yet somehow expressionless. \"Fine. Pull over, Kait.\" Walls. Kait could feel Gabriel\u0027s walls go up, but she had more critical things to think about. She took the next exit off the freeway and the flashing blue and yellow lights followed her. She went quite a way down the street before she could make herself slow and stop. The police car glided up behind her like a shark and stopped, too. Kaitlyn was breathing hard. \"Okay, you guys...\" \"I\u0027ll do the talking,\" Rob said, and Kait was grateful. She watched in the rearview mirror as a figure got out of the cruiser. There was only one officer, a policeman. With numb fingers, Kaitlyn rolled down the window. The policeman bent down a bit. He had a neat dark mustache and a very solid-looking chin. \"Driver\u0027s license,\" he said, and Rob, leaning over Kait, said, \"Excuse me.\" And then Kait felt it. A pulling-back, like the ocean gathering for a tsunami. It came from the backseat. Before she could move or say anything, Gabriel struck. Dark power shot out of him toward the policeman, a wave of crashing, destructive mental energy. The policeman made a sound like a hurt animal and dropped his notebook, clapping his hands to his head. \"No!\" Rob shouted. \"Gabriel, stop!\" Kaitlyn could only feel the echoes of the attack through the web, but it was blinding her, making her sick. Dimly she saw the policeman fall to his knees. Anna was gasping. Lewis was whimpering. Gabriel, stop! Rob roared in a voice to cut through all the confusion. You\u0027ll kill him. Stop! I have to help him, Kaitlyn thought. We can\u0027t become murderers... I have to help... It took a tremendous effort of will to turn around, to focus on Gabriel\u0027s mind. She wanted to shield herself from the terrible power still pouring out of Gabriel. Instead, she opened herself to it, trying to break through to him. Gabriel, you\u0027re not a killer, not anymore, she told him. Please stop. Please stop. She had a sense of wavering, and then the black torrent eased. It seemed to flow back into Gabriel, where it disappeared without a trace. Trembling, Kaitlyn leaned her head against the seat back. There was absolute silence in the car. Then Rob erupted. \" Why? Why did you do that?\" \"Because he would never have listened to us. Nobody\u0027s going to listen, Kessler. Nobody\u0027s on our side. We\u0027ve got to fight if we want to live. But you don\u0027t know anything about that, do you?\" \"I\u0027ll show you something about it - \" \"Stop it!\" Kaitlyn shouted, grabbing Rob, who was lunging at Gabriel. \"Shut up, both of you. We don\u0027t have time to fight - we\u0027ve got to get out of here, now.\" She fumbled with the door handle and flung the door open, dragging her duffel bag behind her. The policeman was lying still now, but to Kaitlyn\u0027s relief he was breathing. Who knows if his mind\u0027s okay, though, she thought. Gabriel\u0027s power could drive people into screaming insanity. The others were scrambling out of the car. Lewis was ghastly pale in the police car\u0027s headlights, and Anna\u0027s dark eyes were huge - owl eyes. When Rob knelt by the policeman, Kaitlyn could feel the tension in his body. Rob passed a hand over the policeman\u0027s chest. \"I think he\u0027ll be all right - \" \"Then let\u0027s go,\" Kaitlyn said, casting a desperate look around and pulling at him. \"Before somebody sees us, before they send more police...\" \"Take his badge first,\" Gabriel suggested nastily, and that got Rob on his feet. And then something seemed to break in all of them simultaneously, and they were running away from the deserted police car. At first Kaitlyn didn\u0027t care where she was running. Gabriel was in the lead, and she blindly followed his twists and turns onto side streets. Eventually, though, when a stabbing pain in her side slowed her down to a walk, she began to notice her surroundings. Oh, God, where are we? \"It\u0027s not Mister Rogers\u0027 neighborhood,\" Lewis muttered and jammed his baseball cap on backward. It was the most eerie and menacing street Kait had ever seen. The gas station they were passing was derelict: no glass in the windows, no gas pumps. So was the station across the road. The Dairy Belle snack shop was enclosed by a very solid-looking chain-link fence - a fence that had barbed wire on the top. Beyond the Dairy Belle was a liquor store with a flickering yellow sign and iron bars in front of the glass windows. It was open and several men stood in the doorway. Kaitlyn saw one of them look across the street - directly at her. She couldn\u0027t see his face, but she saw teeth flash in a grin. The man elbowed one of his companions, then took a step toward the street.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-possessed-dark-visions-2/page-2.html","bookId":2125,"book":{"id":2125,"title":"The Possessed (Dark Visions #2)","description":"Storyline: The Possessed (Dark Visions #2) The bestselling author of The Forbidden Game brings readers the second volume in her all-new horror trilogy, Dark Visions.
