{"id":93876,"no":1,"title":"Page 1","content":"\"Hurry!\" Kaitlyn gasped as she reached the top of the staircase. And she added with her mind, in case it might make more of an impression that way: Hurry. From four different directions she felt acknowledgment, and an urgency just as strong as her own. Felt it with a sense that wasn\u0027t one of the ordinary five, but that was like seeing music or tasting color. Telepathy was strange. But sometimes comforting. Right now Kait was grateful for Rob\u0027s presence in her mind. It burned with a strong golden glow that warmed and steadied her. She could sense him in the next room, working fast but without panic, flipping through drawers and stuffing jeans and socks into a canvas bag. They were leaving the Institute. Not exactly the way they\u0027d intended to, when they\u0027d come to be part of a year-long psychic research project. Kaitlyn had expected to leave the Zetes Institute next spring with a band playing, a college scholarship under her arm, and her father looking on proudly. Instead, she was scrambling in the middle of the night to get her belongings together and get out before Mr. Zetes caught up with them. Mr. Zetes, the head of the Institute, the one who wanted to turn them into psychic weapons and sell them to the highest bidder. Only maybe now he just wanted them dead. Because they\u0027d found out what he was up to and fought back and beaten him. Impossible as that might sound, with all Mr. Z\u0027s power, they\u0027d won. They\u0027d left him knocked out cold in the secret rooms of his San Francisco mansion. When he woke up he was going to be mad enough to kill. \"What are you taking?\" Anna asked, and her usually calm voice had a hurried sound. \"I don\u0027t know. Clothes - warm clothes, I guess. We don\u0027t know where we\u0027ll be sleeping at night.\" Kait repeated the last thought mentally, so Rob and Lewis and Gabriel could hear. Warm clothes, everybody! A mental voice answered her, sharp as a knife and cool as midnight. And money, it said. Take all the money you can get your hands on. \"Always practical, Gabriel,\" Kaitlyn murmured and stuffed her purse into a duffel bag, recklessly piling jeans and sweaters and underwear on top of it. She took her lucky hundred dollar bill out of a jewelry box on the dresser and jammed it in her pocket. \"What else?\" she said aloud. She found herself grabbing crazy things: a velvet cap with gold embroidery, a necklace that had been her mother\u0027s, the paperback mystery she\u0027d been reading. Finally she jammed in her smallest sketchbook and the plastic box that held her oill pastels and colored pencils. She couldn\u0027t leave without her art kit - she\u0027d rather go naked. And her drawings weren\u0027t just recreation; they were far more important than that. They were how she told the future. Hurry, quick, she thought. Anna was hesitating, looking at a carved wooden mask on the wall. It was Raven, the totem of Anna\u0027s family, and it was much too big to take with them. \"Anna...\" \"I know.\" Anna touched the blunt beak of the mask once with graceful fingers, then turned from it. She smiled at Kaitlyn, her dark eyes serene over high cheekbones. \"Let\u0027s go.\" \"Wait - soap.\" Kait dashed into the bathroom and snagged a bar of Ivory, catching a glimpse of herself in the mirror. Nothing like as serene as Anna - her long red hair was in elflocks, her cheeks were flushed, and the strange blue rings in her eyes were burning smokily. She looked like a feverish witch. \"Okay,\" Rob said as they all met in the hall. \"Everybody ready?\" Kaitlyn looked at them, at the four people who\u0027d become closer to her than she would have imagined any people could be. Rob Kessler, all warmth and color, gold-blond hair and golden eyes. Gabriel Wolfe, arrogant and handsome, like a drawing done in black and white. Anna Eva Whiteraven, her expression gentle even under pressure. Lewis Chao with his almond-shaped eyes glittering with anxiety, slapping a baseball cap onto smooth black hair. Thanks to Gabriel\u0027s power going out of control, they were linked by a telepathic web. None of them would ever be alone again - unless they could find a way to break the link. \"I want to get something from downstairs,\" Gabriel was saying. \"Me, too,\" Rob said, \"and I need Lewis to help. All right, let\u0027s get moving. You all right, Kait?\" \"Just breathless,\" Kaitlyn said. Her heart was pounding, and there was a shakiness in every limb that made her not want to stand still. Rob reached to take her duffel bag with the ruthless courtesy of his North Carolina lineage. For just an instant their hands touched; his strong fingers wrapped around hers. It\u0027ll be all right, he told her in a swift private communication meant for no one else. The feeling that flooded Kaitlyn was almost painful. For God\u0027s sake, not now, she thought and ignored the sparks that swarmed where he\u0027d touched her skin. \"Be careful, you - healer,\" she said and started down the stairs. Lewis kept glancing over his shoulder. \"My computer,\" he mourned softly. \"My stereo, my TV set...\" \"Why don\u0027t you go back and get them?\" Gabriel asked nastily. \"What could be more inconspicuous?\" \"Keep moving, \"Rob ordered. At the bottom of the stairs he said, \"Lewis, come with me.\" Kait followed them. \"What are you doing?\" \"Getting the files,\" Rob said grimly. \"Okay, Lewis, open that panel.\" Of course, Kaitlyn thought. Mr. Zetes\u0027s files, the ones he kept in the hidden room here under the stairway. They were full of all kinds of information, most of it cryptic, some of it undoubtedly incriminating. \"But what can we do with them? Who can we show them to?\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" Rob said. \"But I want them anyway. They prove what he\u0027s been up to.\" Lewis was running sensitive fingertips over the dark paneling on the wall. Kaitlyn could feel what he was doing, trying to locate the spring release with his mind. \"It\u0027s not easy to perform on demand like this,\" he muttered, but then there was a click and the panel slid back. \"Mind over matter,\" Rob said, grinning. Hurry, Kaitlyn told him sharply. She didn\u0027t wait to see him start down into the dimly lit hallway behind the door. She took her duffel bag into the front laboratory where Anna was opening a wire cage. \"Go on,\" she was saying. \"Go on, Georgie Mouse, go on, Sally Mouse...\" She knelt to hold the cage by the open side door. \"You\u0027re letting them out?\" \"I\u0027m sending them away, telling them to find a field. I don\u0027t know what Mr. Z will do to them,\" Anna said. \"I don\u0027t even trust Joyce anymore.\" Joyce Piper was the parapsychologist who actually ran the Institute for Mr. Zetes, the one who\u0027d recruited Kaitlyn. Even now, Kaitlyn couldn\u0027t think about her without feeling a twinge of betrayal. \"Okay, but hurry. We don\u0027t have time to waste,\" she said and moved restlessly back into the hallway. Lewis was tugging at his baseball cap nervously. Gabriel, in the small bedroom beyond, was going through Joyce\u0027s purse. Gabriel! Kait said. She could feel her shock reverberating in the telepathic web, and she tried to muffle it. He merely slanted her an ironic glance. \"We need money.\" \"But you can\u0027t - \" \"Why not?\" he said. His gray eyes were so dark they looked almost black. \"Because it isn\u0027t... it\u0027s not...\" Kaitlyn could feel herself sagging. \"It\u0027s wrong,\" she said finally. Gabriel didn\u0027t admit to concepts like \"wrong.\" \"Joyce is our enemy,\" he said shortly. \"If it wasn\u0027t for her, we wouldn\u0027t be running away in the middle of the night in the first place. It\u0027s necessary - and you know it, don\u0027t you, Kait?\" It was dangerous to look into Gabriel\u0027s eyes for more than an instant. Kaitlyn turned away without answering, then turned back to hiss, \"All right, but don\u0027t take any credit cards. They can trace those. And don\u0027t let Rob know, or he\u0027ll go ballistic. And hurry.\" That one word had begun to pound relentlessly in her brain: hurry, hurry, hurry. Faster than a heartbeat. She had a feeling - no, a certainty - that every second they stayed here was too long. A premonition? But she didn\u0027t have that kind of premonition. It was only by drawing that she could get an image of the future. Hurry. Hurry. Hurry. Trust yourself, she thought suddenly. Go with your feelings. \"Gabriel,\" she said abruptly, \"we\u0027ve got to leave now.\" She added in an urgent mental shout, Lewis, Rob, Anna - we have to leave! Right now, this second! Something\u0027s going to happen - I don\u0027t know what, but we\u0027ve got to get out of here - \"Take it easy.\" She felt Gabriel\u0027s hand on her arm and only then realized how agitated she was. As soon as she\u0027d spoken her feelings out loud, she\u0027d realized how strong they were, how urgent. \"I\u0027m all right, but Gabriel, we\u0027ve got to go...\" He looked into her eyes briefly and nodded. \"If you feel like that - come on.\" In the hallway Rob was hurrying out of the open panel with an armful of file folders. Anna was emerging from the lab. \"What\u0027s wrong? Is someone coming?\" Rob asked. \"I don\u0027t know, I just know we have to hurry - \" \"We\u0027ll take Joyce\u0027s car,\" Gabriel said. Rob hesitated, then nodded. \"Come on, out the back door.\" He hustled Lewis and Anna ahead of him. Kaitlyn followed right on his heels, feeling she couldn\u0027t move fast enough. \"We\u0027ll just use the car to get out of the area,\" Rob was saying, when a wave of adrenaline broke over Kaitlyn. It left a metallic taste of fear in her mouth. Behind her the front door burst open.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-possessed-dark-visions-2/page-1.html","bookId":2125,"book":{"id":2125,"title":"The Possessed (Dark Visions #2)","description":"Storyline: The Possessed (Dark Visions #2) The bestselling author of The Forbidden Game brings readers the second volume in her all-new horror trilogy, Dark Visions.
