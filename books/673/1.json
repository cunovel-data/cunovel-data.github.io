{"id":27183,"no":1,"title":"PREFACE.","content":"The Soudan, two years ago, was a name unknown to the million, and I will venture to say that at that time not one in fifty knew anything about it. Only those who could afford to obtain Sir Samuel Baker’s interesting and instructive work, “The Nile Sources of Abyssinia,” would be acquainted with the locality and other particulars. \\n\\n \\n\\n The literature extant on Egypt proper would probably amount to tons, but that on the Soudan would occupy a very small space indeed on the library shelf, for the simple reason that so very few have travelled through it. \\n\\n \\n\\n [ii] \\n\\n \\n\\n In November, 1881, I left England to accompany six gentlemen on an exploring expedition in the Soudan, and, in view of passing events in Egypt and that locality, I indulged in the hope that an account of my journey will not be unacceptable to the public. I held the post of medical officer to the expedition, partly on account of my experience in the Turkish war, where I was continually brought face to face with dysentery, ague, and other tropical diseases, which are so easily recognised without any extraneous assistance, medical or lay, but which are troublesome to treat, especially when hampered by an ignorant and fussy interference. Doubtless many faults of omission and commission may be found in my book; but I trust that those who criticise it will do so leniently, and remember that it has been written during spare hours, when the exigencies of practice would allow of my seeking recreation by the use of my pen. “Oh, that mine enemy would write a book!” was the heartfelt expression of a vindictive old gentleman, well known for his great patience. My enemies, I trust, are few; those I have shall be gratified, though I hope I shall not find[iii] any who are utterly callous, but will use me in a gentlemanly fashion. \\n\\n \\n\\n I have ventured to describe not only my travels in the Soudan, but the journey from England and home again, extracted from my journal, which is most accurate, as I kept it religiously day by day. Much of the old-world history has been culled from various sources of information. The Illustrations of Soudan scenery, natives, and objects of interest are from rude sketches of my own, elaborated by Mr. Fanshawe, a perfect master in the art. The frontispiece is from a photograph taken by Messrs. Lombardi and Co., of Pall Mall. \\n\\n \\n\\n Although I am aware of the fact that Mr. F. L. James has published a book on the Soudan, I have carefully refrained from reading it, fearing I might inadvertently use any of his expressions, and also feeling sure that in some matters we may materially differ in opinion. \\n\\n \\n\\n Although I have, on some occasions, written for the medical journals, I am quite aware that there may be many faults of style and finish in this my first effort at a book; such shortcomings I would[iv] ask the reader to overlook. It is but a plain, unvarnished account of a journey through a territory hitherto but little known, and as such I trust it may be of interest to the majority of my readers. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1991/56962.html","bookId":673,"book":{"id":673,"title":"Life in the Soudan：Adventures Amongst the Tribes, and Travels in Egypt, in 1881 and 1882","description":"简介： The Soudan, two years ago, was a name unknown to the million, and I will venture to say that at that time not one in fifty knew anything about it.
