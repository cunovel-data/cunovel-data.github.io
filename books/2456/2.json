{"id":80771,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"Jill was already late for the briefing when she somehow managed to drop her\\n\\n keys into her cup of coffee on the way out the door. There was a muted ting as they hit the bottom, and as she paused in mid-stride, staring in disbelief at the steaming ceramic mug, the thick stack of files she carried under her other arm slid smoothly to the floor. Paper clips and sticky notes scattered across the tan carpeting.\\n\\n Ah, shit.\\n\\n She checked her watch as she turned back toward the kitchen, cup in hand. Wesker had called the meeting for 1900 sharp, which meant she had about nine minutes to make the ten-minute drive, find parking and get her butt into a chair. The first full disclosure meeting since the S.T.A.R.S. had gotten the case - hell, the first real meeting since she\u0027d made the Raccoon transfer-and she was going to be late.\\n\\n Figures. Probably the first time in years I actually give a rat\u0027s ass about being on time and I fall apart at the door...\\n\\n Muttering darkly she hurried to the sink, feeling tense and angry with herself for not getting ready earlier. It was the case, the goddamn case. She\u0027d picked up her copies of the ME files right after breakfast and spent all day digging through the reports, searching for something that the cops had somehow missed and feeling more and more frustrated as the day slipped past and she\u0027d failed to come up with anything new.\\n\\n She dumped the mug and scooped up the warm, wet keys, wiping them against her jeans as she hurried back to the front door. She crouched down to gather the files-and stopped, staring down at the glossy color photo that had ended up on top.\\n\\n Oh, girls...\\n\\n She picked it up slowly, knowing that she didn\u0027t have time and yet unable to look away from the tiny, blood-spattered faces. She felt the knots of tension that had been building all day intensify, and for a moment it was all she could do to breathe as she stared at the crime scene photo. Becky and Priscilla McGee, ages nine and seven. She\u0027d flipped past it earlier, telling herself that there was nothing there she needed to see... ... But it isn \u0027t true, is it? You can keep pretending, or you can admit it-everything\u0027s different now, it\u0027s been different since the day they died.\\n\\n When she\u0027d first moved to Raccoon, she\u0027d been under a lot of stress, feeling uncertain about the transfer, not even sure if she wanted to stay with the S.T.A.R.S. She was good at the job, but had only taken it because of Dick; after the indictment, he\u0027d started to pressure her to get into another line of work. It had taken awhile, but her father was persistent, telling her again and again that one Valentine in jail was one too many, even admitting that he was wrong to raise her the way he had. With her training and background, there weren\u0027t a whole lot of options - but the S.T.A.R.S., at least, appreciated her skills and didn\u0027t care how she came by them. The pay was decent, there was the element of risk she\u0027d grown to enjoy... In retrospect, the career change had been surprisingly easy; it made Dick happy, and gave her the opportunity to see how the other half lived.\\n\\n Still, the move had been harder on her than she\u0027d realized. For the first time since Dick had gone inside, she\u0027d felt truly alone, and working for the law had started to seem like a joke - the daughter of Dick Valentine, working for truth, justice, and the American way. Her promotion to the Alphas, a nice little house in the suburbs - it was crazy, and she\u0027d been giving serious thought to just blowing out of town, giving the whole thing up, and going back to what she\u0027d been before... ... until the two little girls who lived across the street had shown up on her doorstep and asked her with wide, tear-stained eyes if she was really a policeman. Their parents were at work, and they couldn\u0027t find their dog... ... Becky in her green school dress, little Pris in her overalls-both of them sniffling and shy...\\n\\n The pup had been wandering through a garden only a few blocks away, no sweat and she\u0027d made two new friends, as easy as that. The sisters had promptly adopted Jill, showing up after school to bring her scraggly bunches of flowers, playing in her yard on weekends, singing her endless songs they\u0027d learned from movies and cartoons. It wasn\u0027t like the girls had miraculously changed her outlook or taken away her loneliness, but somehow her thoughts of leaving had been put on a back burner, left alone for awhile. For the first time in her twenty-three years, she\u0027d started to feel like a part of the community she lived and worked in, the change so subtle and gradual that she\u0027d hardly noticed.\\n\\n Six weeks ago, Becky and Pris had wandered away from a family picnic in Victory Park and became the first two victims of the psychopaths that had since terrorized the isolated city.\\n\\n The photo trembled slightly in her hand, sparing her nothing. Becky lying on her back, staring blindly at the sky, a gaping, ragged hole in her belly. Pris was sprawled next to her, arms outstretched, chunks of flesh ripped savagely from the slender limbs. Both children had been eviscerated, dying of massive trauma before they\u0027d bled out. If they\u0027d screamed, no one had heard...\\n\\n Enough! They\u0027re gone, but you can finally do something about it!\\n\\n Jill fumbled the papers back into their folder, then stepped outside into the early evening, breathing deeply. The scent of freshly cut grass was heavy in the sun-warmed air. Somewhere down the street, a dog barked happily amidst the shouts of children.\\n\\n She hurried to the small, dented gray hatchback parked by the front walk, forcing herself not to look at the silent McGee house as she started the car and pulled away from the curb. Jill drove through the wide suburban streets of her neighborhood, window down, pushing the speed limit but careful to watch for kids and pets. There weren\u0027t many of either around. Since the trouble had started, more and more people were keeping their children and animals indoors, even during the day.\\n\\n The little hatchback shuddered as she accelerated up the ramp to Highway 202, the warm, dry air whipping her long hair back from her face. It felt good, like waking up from a bad dream. She sped through the sun-dappled evening, the shadows of trees growing long across the road.\\n\\n Whether it was fate or just the luck of the draw, her life had been touched by what was happening in Raccoon City. She couldn\u0027t keep pretending that she was just some jaded ex-thief trying to stay out of jail, trying to toe the line to make her father happy, or that what the S.T.A.R.S. were about to do was just another job. It mattered. It mattered to her that those children were dead, and that the killers were still free to kill again.\\n\\n The victim files next to her fluttered slightly, the top of the folder caught by the wind; nine restless spirits, perhaps, Becky and Priscilla McGee\u0027s among them.\\n\\n She rested her right hand on the ruffled sheaf, stilling the gentle movement and swore to herself that no matter what it took, she was going to find out who was responsible. Whatever she\u0027d been before, whatever she would be in the future, she had changed... and wouldn\u0027t be able to rest until these murderers of the innocent had been held accountable for their actions.\\n\\n Yo, Chris!\\n\\n Chris turned away from the soda machine and saw Forest Speyer striding down the empty hall toward him, a wide grin on his tanned, boyish face. Forest was actually a few years older than Chris, but looked like a rebellious teenager - long hair, studded jean jacket, a tattoo of a skull smoking a cigarette on his left shoulder. He was also an excellent mechanic, and one of the best shots Chris had ever seen in action.\\n\\n Hey, Forest. What\u0027s up? Chris scooped up a can of club soda from the machine\u0027s dispenser and glanced at his watch. He still had a couple of minutes before the meeting. He smiled tiredly as Forest stopped in front of him, blue eyes sparkling. Forest was carrying an armful of equipment-vest, utility belt, and shoulder pack.\\n\\n Wesker gave Marini the go-ahead to start the search. Bravo team\u0027s goin\u0027 in. Even excited, Forest\u0027s Alabama twang slowed his words to a stereotypical drawl. He dropped his stuff on one of the visitors\u0027 chairs, still grinning widely.\\n\\n Chris frowned. When?\\n\\n Now. Soon as I warm up the \u0027copter. Forest pulled the kevlar vest on over his T-shirt as he spoke.\\n\\n While you Alphas sit taking notes, we\u0027re gonna go kick some cannibal ass!\\n\\n Nothing if not confident, us S.T.A.R.S. Yeah, well... just watch your ass, okay? I still think there\u0027s more going on here than a couple of slobbering nut jobs hanging around in the woods.\\n\\n You know it. Forest pushed his hair back and grabbed his utility belt, obviously already focused on the mission. Chris thought about saying more, but decided against it. For all of his bravado, Forest was a professional; he didn\u0027t need to be told to be careful.\\n\\n You sure about that, Chris? You think Billy was careful enough?\\n\\n Sighing inwardly, Chris slapped Forest\u0027s shoulder lightly and headed for ops through the doorway of the small upstairs waiting room and down the hall. He was surprised that Wesker was sending the teams in separately. Although it was standard for the less experienced S.T.A.R.S. to do the initial recon, this wasn\u0027t exactly a standard operation. The number of deaths they were dealing with alone was enough to call for a more aggressive offense. The fact that there were signs of organization to the murders should have brought it to A1 status, and Wesker was still treating it like some kind of a training run.\\n\\n Nobody else sees it; they didn\u0027t know Billy...\\n\\n Chris thought again about the late-night call he\u0027d gotten last week from his childhood friend. He hadn\u0027t heard from Billy in awhile, but knew that he\u0027d taken a research position with Umbrella, the pharmaceutical company that was the single biggest contributor to the economic prosperity of Raccoon City. Billy had never been the type to jump at shadows, and the terrified desperation in his voice had jolted Chris awake, filling him with deep concern. Billy had babbled that his life was in danger, that they were all in danger, begged Chris to meet him at a diner at the edge of town and then never showed up. No one had heard from him since.\\n\\n Chris had run it over and over again in his mind during the sleepless nights since Billy\u0027s disappearance, trying to convince himself that there was no connection to the attacks on Raccoon and yet was unable to shake his growing certainty that there was more going on than met the eye, and that Billy had known what it was. The cops had checked out Billy\u0027s apartment and found nothing to indicate foul play... but Chris\u0027s instincts told him that his friend was dead, and that he\u0027d been killed by somebody who wanted to keep him from talking.\\n\\n And I seem to be the only one. Irons doesn\u0027t give a shit, and the team thinks I\u0027m just torn up over the loss of an old friend.\\n\\n He pushed the thoughts aside as he turned the corner, his boot heels sending muted echoes through the arched second floor corridor. He had to focus, to keep his mind on what he could do to find out why Billy had disappeared, but he was exhausted, running on a minimum of sleep and an almost constant anxiety that had plagued him since Billy\u0027s call. Maybe he was losing his perspective, his objectivity dulled by recent events...\\n\\n He forced himself not to think about anything at all as he neared the S.T.A.R.S. office, determined to be clear-headed for the meeting. The buzzing fluorescents above seemed like overkill in the blazing evening light that filled the tight hallway; the Raccoon police building was a classic, if unconventional, piece of architecture, lots of inlaid tile and heavy wood, but it had too many windows designed to catch the sun.\\n\\n When he\u0027d been a kid, the building had been the Raccoon City Hall. With the population increase a decade back, it had been renovated as a library, and four years ago, turned into a police station. It seemed like there was always some kind of construction going on.\\n\\n The door to the S.T.A.R.S. office stood open, the muted sounds of gruff male voices spilling out into the hall. Chris hesitated a moment, hearing Chief Irons\u0027s among them. Just call me Brian Irons was a self-centered and self-serving politician masquerading as a cop. It was no secret that he had his sweaty fingers in more than a few local pies. He\u0027d even been implicated in the Cider district land-scam back in \u002794, and although nothing had been proved in court, anyone who knew him personally didn\u0027t harbor any doubt.\\n\\n Chris shook his head, listening to Irons\u0027s greasy voice. Hard to believe he\u0027d once led the Raccoon S.T.A.R.S., even as a paper-pusher. Maybe even harder to believe that he\u0027d probably end up as mayor someday.\\n\\n Of course, it doesn\u0027t help much that he hates your guts, does it, Redfield?\\n\\n Yeah, well. Chris didn\u0027t like to kiss ass, and Irons didn\u0027t know how to have any other kind of relationship. At least Irons wasn\u0027t a total incompetent, he\u0027d had some military training. Chris pasted on a straight face and stepped into the small, cluttered office that served as the S.T.A.R.S. filing cabinet and base of operations.\\n\\n Barry and Joseph were over by the rookie desk, going through a box of papers and talking quietly.\\n\\n Brad Vickers, the Alpha pilot, was drinking coffee and staring at the main computer screen a few feet away, a sour expression on his mild features. Across the room Captain Wesker was leaning back in his chair, hands behind his head, smiling blankly at something Chief Irons was telling him. Irons\u0027s bulk was leaned against Wesker\u0027s desk, one pudgy hand brushing at his carefully groomed mustache as he spoke.\\n\\n So I said, \u0027You\u0027re gonna print what I tell you to print, Bertolucci, and you\u0027re gonna like it, or you\u0027ll never get another quote from this office!\u0027 And he says Chris! Wesker interrupted the chief, sitting forward. Good, you\u0027re here. Looks like we can stop wasting time.\\n\\n Irons scowled in his direction but Chris kept his poker face. Wesker didn\u0027t care much for Irons, either, and didn\u0027t bother trying to be any more than polite in his dealings with the man. From the glint in his eye, it was obvious that he didn\u0027t care who knew it, either.\\n\\n Chris walked into the office and stood by the desk he shared with Ken Sullivan, one of the Bravo team.\\n\\n Since the teams usually worked different shifts, they didn\u0027t need much room. He set the unopened can of soda on the battered desktop and looked at Wesker.\\n\\n You\u0027re sending Bravo in?\\n\\n The captain gazed back at him impassively, arms folded across his chest. Standard procedure, Chris.\\n\\n Chris sat down, frowning. Yeah, but with what we talked about last week, I thought Irons interrupted. I gave the order, Redfield. I know you think that there\u0027s some kind of cloak and dagger going on here, but 7 don\u0027t see any reason to deviate from policy.\\n\\n Sanctimonious prick...\\n\\n Chris forced a smile, knowing it would irritate Irons. Of course, sir. No need to explain yourself on my behalf.\\n\\n Irons glared at him for a moment, his piggy little eyes snapping, then apparently decided to let it drop.\\n\\n He turned back to Wesker. I\u0027ll expect a report when Bravo returns. Now if you\u0027ll excuse me, Captain.\\n\\n Wesker nodded. Chief.\\n\\n Irons stalked past Chris and out of the room. He\u0027d been gone less than a minute before Barry started in.\\n\\n Think the chief took a shit today? Maybe we all oughtta chip in for Christmas, get him some laxatives.\\n\\n Joseph and Brad laughed, but Chris couldn\u0027t bring himself to join in. Irons was a joke, but his mishandling of this investigation wasn\u0027t all that funny. The S.T.A.R.S. should\u0027ve been called in at the beginning instead of acting as RPD back up.\\n\\n He looked back at Wesker, the man\u0027s perpetually composed expression hard to read. Wesker had taken over the Raccoon S.T.A.R.S. only a few months ago, transferred by the home office in New York, and Chris still didn\u0027t have any real insight into his character.\\n\\n The new captain seemed to be everything he was reputed to be: smooth, professional, cool, but there was a kind of distance to him, a sense that he was often far removed from what was going on.\\n\\n Wesker sighed and stood up. Sorry, Chris. I know you wanted things to go different, but Irons didn\u0027t put a whole lot of stock into your... misgivings.\\n\\n Chris nodded. Wesker could make recommendations, but Irons was the only one who could upgrade a mission\u0027s status. Not your fault.\\n\\n Barry walked toward them, scruffing at his short, reddish beard with one giant fist. Barry Burton was only six feet tall but built like a truck. His only passion outside of his family and his weapons collection was weight lifting, and it showed.\\n\\n Don\u0027t sweat it, Chris. Marini will call us in the second he smells trouble. Irons is just pullin\u0027 your chain.\\n\\n Chris nodded again, but he didn\u0027t like it. Hell, Enrico Marini and Forest Speyer were the only experienced soldiers in Bravo. Ken Sullivan was a good scout and a brilliant chemist, but in spite of his S.T.A.R.S. training, he couldn\u0027t shoot the broad side of a barn. Richard Aiken was a top-rate communications expert, but he also lacked field experience.\\n\\n Rounding out Bravo team was Rebecca Chambers, who\u0027d only been with the S.T.A.R.S. for three weeks, supposed to be some kind of medical genius. Chris had met her a couple of times and she seemed bright enough, but she was just a kid.\\n\\n It\u0027s not enough. Even with all of us, it may not be enough.\\n\\n He cracked open his soda but didn\u0027t drink any, wondering instead what the S.T.A.R.S. were going up against, Billy\u0027s pleading, desperate words echoing through his mind yet again.\\n\\n They\u0027re going to kill me, Chris! They\u0027re going to kill everyone who knows! Meet me at Emmy\u0027s, now, I\u0027ll tell you everything...\\n\\n Exhausted, Chris stared off into space, alone in the knowledge that the savage murders were only the tip of the proverbial iceberg.\\n\\n Barry stood by Chris\u0027s desk for a minute, trying to think of something else to say, but Chris didn\u0027t look like he was in the mood for conversation. Barry shrugged inwardly and headed back to where Joseph was going through files. Chris was a good guy, but he took things too hard sometimes; he\u0027d get over it as soon as it was their turn to step in.\\n\\n Man, it was hot! Seemingly endless trickles of sweat rolled down his spine, gluing his T-shirt to his broad back. The air-conditioning was on the fritz as usual, and even with the door open, the tiny S.T.A.R.S. office was uncomfortably warm.\\n\\n Any luck?\\n\\n Joseph looked up at him from the pile of papers, a rueful smirk on his lean face. You kidding? It\u0027s like somebody hid the damn thing on purpose.\\n\\n Barry sighed and scooped up a handful of files.\\n\\n Maybe Jill found it. She was still here when I left last night, going through the witness reports for about the hundredth time...\\n\\n What are you two looking for, anyway? Brad asked.\\n\\n Barry and Joseph both looked over at Brad, still sitting at the computer console, headset on. He\u0027d be monitoring Bravo\u0027s progress throughout their fly-by of the forested district, but for now he looked bored as hell.\\n\\n Joseph answered him. Ah, Barry claims that there are floor plans in here somewhere on the old Spencer estate, some architectural digest that came out when the house was built He paused, then grinned at Brad. Except that I\u0027m thinkin\u0027 that ol\u0027 Barry\u0027s gone senile on us. They say memory is the first thing to go.\\n\\n Barry scowled good-naturedly. Ol\u0027 Barry could easily kick your ass into next week, little man.\\n\\n Joseph looked at him mock-seriously. Yeah, but would you remember it afterwards?\\n\\n Barry chuckled, shaking his head. He was only thirty-eight, but had been with the Raccoon S.T.A.R.S. for fifteen years, making him the senior member. He endured numerous old age jokes, mostly from Joseph.\\n\\n Brad cocked an eyebrow. The Spencer place? Why would it be in a magazine?\\n\\n You kids, gotta learn your history. Barry said. It was designed by the one and only George Trevor, just before he disappeared. He was that hot-shit architect who did all those weird skyscrapers in D.C. - in fact, Trevor\u0027s disappearance may have been the reason that Spencer shut the mansion down. Rumor has it that Trevor went crazy during the construction and when it was finished, he got lost and wandered the halls until he starved to death.\\n\\n Brad scoffed, but suddenly looked uneasy. That\u0027s bullshit. I never heard anything like that.\\n\\n Joseph winked at Barry. No, it\u0027s true. Now his tortured ghost roams the estate each night, pale and emaciated, and I\u0027ve heard tell that sometimes you can hear him, calling out, \u0027Brad Vickers... bring me Brad Vickers\u0027\\n\\n Brad flushed slightly. Yeah, ha ha. You\u0027re a real comedian, Frost.\\n\\n Barry shook his head, smiling, but wondered again how Brad had ever made it to Alpha. He was undoubtedly the best hacker working for S.T.A.R.S., and a decent enough pilot, but he wasn\u0027t so hot under pressure. Joseph had taken to calling him Chickenheart Vickers when he wasn\u0027t around, and while the S.T.A.R.S. generally stuck up for one another, nobody disagreed with Joseph\u0027s assessment.\\n\\n So is that why Spencer shut it down? Brad addressed this to Barry, his cheeks still red.\\n\\n Barry shrugged. I doubt it. It was supposed to be some kind of guest house for Umbrella\u0027s top execs.\\n\\n Trevor did disappear right about the time of compleTion, but Spencer was whacko, anyway. He decided to move Umbrella\u0027s headquarters to Europe, I forgot where exactly, and just boarded up the mansion.\\n\\n Probably a couple million bucks, straight into the crapper.\\n\\n Joseph sneered. Right. Like Umbrella would suffer.\\n\\n True enough. Spencer may have been crazy, but he\u0027d had enough money and business savvy to hire the right people. Umbrella was one of the biggest medical research and pharmaceutical companies on the planet. Even thirty years ago, the loss of a few million dollars probably hadn\u0027t hurt.\\n\\n Anyway, Joseph went on, the Umbrella people told Irons that they\u0027d sent someone out to check the place over, and that it was secure, no break-ins.\\n\\n So why look for blueprints? Brad asked.\\n\\n It was Chris who answered, startling Barry. He\u0027d walked back to join them, his youthful face fixed with a sudden intensity that almost bordered on obsessive.\\n\\n Because it\u0027s the only place in the woods that hasn\u0027t been checked over by the police, and it\u0027s practically in the middle of the crime scenes. And because you can\u0027t always trust what people say.\\n\\n Brad frowned. But if Umbrella sent somebody out...\\n\\n Whatever Chris was going to say in response was cut short by Wesker\u0027s smooth voice, rising from the front of the room.\\n\\n All right, people. Since it appears that Ms. Valentine isn\u0027t planning on joining us, why don\u0027t we get this started?\\n\\n Barry walked to his desk, worried about Chris for the first time since this whole thing had started. He\u0027d recruited the younger man for the S.T.A.R.S. a few years back thanks to a chance encounter in a local gun shop. Chris had proved to be an asset to the team, bright and thoughtful as well as a top-notch marksman and able pilot.\\n\\n But now...\\n\\n Barry gazed fondly at the picture of Kathy and the girls that sat on his desk. Chris\u0027s obsession with the murders in Raccoon was understandable, particularly since his friend had disappeared. Nobody in town wanted to see another life lost. Barry had a family, and was as determined as anyone else on the team to stop the killers. But Chris\u0027s relentless suspicion had gone a little overboard. What had he meant by that, You can\u0027t always trust what people say? Either that Umbrella was lying or Chief Irons was...\\n\\n Ridiculous. Umbrella\u0027s branch chemical plant and administrative buildings on the outskirts of town supplied three-quarters of the jobs in Raccoon City; it would be counter-productive for them to lie. Besides, Umbrella\u0027s integrity was at least as solid as any other major corporation\u0027s-maybe some industrial espionage, but medical secret-swapping was a far cry from murder. And Chief Irons, though a fat, weasely blowhard, wasn\u0027t the kind to get his hands any dirtier than they\u0027d get accepting illegal campaign funds; the guy wanted to be mayor, for chrissake.\\n\\n Barry\u0027s gaze lingered on the picture of his family a moment longer before he turned his chair around to face Wesker\u0027s desk, and he suddenly realized that he wanted Chris to be wrong. Whatever was going on in Raccoon City, that kind of vicious brutality couldn\u0027t be planned. And that meant...\\n\\n Barry didn\u0027t know what that meant. He sighed, and waited for the meeting to begin. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-umbrella-conspiracy-resident-evil-1/page-2.html","bookId":2456,"book":{"id":2456,"title":"The Umbrella Conspiracy (Resident Evil #1)","description":"Storyline: \"The Umbrella Conspiracy\": The Special Tactics and Rescue Squad (S.T.A.R.S.) investigate a string of grisly murders in a remote mountain community -- and discover evidence of a widespread conspiracy.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-umbrella-conspiracy-resident-evil-1.jpg","author":"S.D.
