For all the years they tiptoed while their father was writing.\n Frank Herbert\n For all those healers who ease our suffering; for people who feed people, then ask them for virtue; for our friends - gratitude and affection.\n Bill Ransom\n The Histories assert that a binary system cannot support life. But we found life here on Pandora. Except for the kelp, it was antagonistic and deadly, but still it was life. Ship\u0027s judgment is upon us now because we wiped out the kelp and unbalanced this world. We few survivors are subject to the endless sea and the terrible vagaries of the two suns. That we survive at all on our fragile Clone-rafts is as much a curse as a victory. This is the time of madness.\n - Hali Ekel, the Journals Duque smelled burning flesh and scorched hair. He sniffed, sniffed again, and whined. His one good eye watered and pained him when he tried to knuckle it open. His mother was out. Out was a word he could say, like hot and Ma. He could not precisely identify the location and shape of out. He knew vaguely that his quarters were on a Clone-raft anchored off a black stone pinnacle, all that remained of Pandora\u0027s land surface.\n The burning smells were stronger now. They frightened him. Duque wondered if he should say something. Mostly, he did not talk; his nose got in the way. He could whistle through his nose, though, and his mother understood. She would whistle back. Between them, they understood more than a hundred whistle-words. Duque wriggled his forehead. This uncurled his thick, knobby nose and he whistled - tentative at first to see whether she was near.\n \"Ma? Where are you, Ma?\"\n He listened for the unmistakable scuff-slap, scuff-slap of her bare feet on the soft slick deck of the raft.\n Burning smells filled his nose and made him sneeze. He heard the slaps of many feet out in the corridor, more feet than he had ever before heard out there, but nothing he could identify as Ma. There was shouting now, words Duque did not know. He sucked in a deep breath and let go the loudest whistle he could muster. His thin ribs ached with it and the vibration made him dizzy.\n No one responded. The hatch beside him remained closed. No one plucked him out of his twisted covers and held him close.\n Despite the pain of the smoke, Duque peeled back his right eyelid with the two nubs on his right hand and saw that the room was dark except for a glow against the thin organics of the corridor wall. Dull orange light cast a frightening illumination over the deck. Acrid smoke hung like a cloud above him, tendrils of its oily blackness reaching downward toward his face. And now there were other sounds outside added to the shouting and the slap-slap of many feet. He heard big things dragging and bumping along his glowing wall. Terror held him curled into a silent lump under the covers of his bunk.\n The burning smells contained a steamy, bitter flavor - not quite the sticky-sweet of the time when the stove scorched their wall. He remembered the charred melt of organics opening a new passage between their room and the next one along the corridor. He had poked his head through the burned opening and whistled at their neighbors. The smells now were not the same, though, and the glowing wall did not melt away.\n A rumbling was added to the outside sounds. Like a pot boiling over on the stove, but his mother was not cooking. Besides, it was too loud for cooking, louder even than the other corridor noises. Now, there were screams nearby.\n Duque kicked off his covers and gasped when his bare feet touched the deck.\n Hot!\n Abruptly, the deck pitched, first backward and then forward. The motion lurched him face-first through the bulkhead. The hot organics of the wall stretched and parted for him like a cooked noodle. He knew he was on the outer deck but stumbling feet kept him too busy covering his head and body with his arms. He could not spare a hand to open his good eye. The hot deck burned his knees and elbows. Duque caught his breath in the sudden onslaught of pain and wrenched out another shrill whistle. Somebody stumbled against him. Hands reached under his armpits and lifted him clear of the scorched bubbly that had been the deck. Some of it came loose with him and stuck to his bare skin. Duque knew who held him by the jasmine smell of her hair - Ellie, the neighbor woman with the short, stubby legs and beautiful voice.\n \"Duque,\" she said, \"let\u0027s go find your ma.\"\n He heard something wrong in her voice. It rasped low in a dry throat and cracked when she spoke.\n \"Ma,\" he said. He knuckled his eye open and saw a nightmare of movement and firelight.\n Ellie shouldered them through the crowd, saw that he was looking around and slapped his hand away. \"Look later,\" she said. \"Right now you hang on to my neck. Hold tight.\"\n After that one brief glimpse, there was no need to repeat the order. He clutched both arms around Ellie\u0027s neck. A small whimper escaped his throat. Ellie continued to push them through a crowd of people - voices all around saying words Duque did not understand. Movement against the others peeled away chunks of bubbly from his skin. It hurt.\n That one look at out remained indelibly in Duque\u0027s memory. Fire had been coming out of the dark water! It coiled up out of the water accompanied by that thick, boiling sound and the air was so full of steam that people were shadow clumps against the hot red glow of flames. Screams and shouts still sounded all around, causing Duque to hold even tighter to Ellie\u0027s neck. Chunks of the fire had rocketed into the sky high above their island. Duque did not understand this but he heard the fire crash and sizzle through the body of the island into the sea beneath.\n Why water burn? He knew the whistle-words but Ellie would not understand.\n The raft tipped sharply under Ellie and sent her sprawling beneath the trampling feet with Duque atop her shielded from the burning deck. Ellie cursed and gasped. More people fell around them. Duque felt Ellie sinking into the melting organics of the deck. She struggled at first, thrashing like a fresh-caught muree that his mother had put into his hands once before she cooked it. Ellie\u0027s twisting slowed and she began moaning low in her throat. Duque, still clutching Ellie\u0027s neck, felt hot bubbly against his hands and jerked them away. Ellie screamed. Duque tried to push himself away from her but the press of bodies all around prevented his escape. He felt the hair at the nape of his neck standing up. A questing whistle broke from his nose but there was no response.\n The deck tilted again and bodies rolled onto Duque. He felt hot flesh, some of it warm-wet. Ellie gasped once, very deep. The air changed. The people screaming, \"Oh, no! Oh, no!\" stopped screaming. Many people began coughing all around Duque. He coughed, too, choking on hot, thick dust. Someone nearby gasped: \"I\u0027ve got Vata. Help me. We must save her.\"\n Duque sensed a stillness in Ellie. She wasn\u0027t moaning anymore. He could not feel the rise and fall of her breathing. Duque opened his mouth and spoke the two words he knew best:\n \"Ma. Hot, Ma. Ma.\"\n Someone right beside him said: \"Who\u0027s that?\"\n \"Hot, Ma,\" Duque said.\n Hands touched him and hauled him away from Ellie. A voice next to his ear said: \"It\u0027s a child. He\u0027s alive.\"\n \"Bring him!\" someone called between coughs. \"We\u0027ve got Vata.\"\n Duque felt himself passed from hand to hand through an opening into a dimly lighted place. His one good eye saw through a thinner dust haze the glitter of tiny lights, shiny surfaces and handles. He wondered if this could be the out where Ma went but there was no sign of Ma, only many people crowded into a small space. Someone directly in front of him held a large naked infant. He knew about infants because Ma sometimes brought them from out and cared for them, cooing over them and letting Duque touch them and pet them. Infants were soft and nice. This infant looked larger than any Duque had ever seen but he knew she was only an infant - those fat features, that still face.\n The air pressure changed, popping in Duque\u0027s ears. Something began to hum. Just when Duque was deciding to come out of his fears and join in this warm closeness of flesh, three gigantic explosions shook all of them, sending their enclosed space tumbling.\n \"Boom! Boom! Boom!\" the explosions came one on top of the other.\n People began extricating themselves from the tumble of flesh. A foot touched Duque\u0027s face and was withdrawn.\n \"Careful of the little ones,\" someone said.\n Strong hands lifted Duque and helped him open his eye. A pale masculine face peered at him - a wide face with deeply set brown eyes. The man spoke. \"I\u0027ve got the other one. He\u0027s no beauty but he\u0027s alive.\"\n \"Here, give him to me,\" a woman said.\n Duque found himself pressed close to the infant. A woman\u0027s arms held them both, flesh to flesh, warmth to warmth. A sense of reassurance swept through Duque but it was cut off immediately when the woman spoke. He understood her words! He did not know how he understood but the meanings were there unfolding as her voice rumbled against his cheek pressed to her breast.\n \"The whole island exploded,\" the woman said. \"I saw it through the port.\"\n \"We\u0027re well below the surface now,\" a man said. \"But we can\u0027t stay long with this many people breathing our air.\"\n \"We will pray to Rock,\" the woman said.\n \"And to Ship,\" a man said.\n \"To Rock and to Ship,\" they all agreed.\n Duque heard all of this from a distance as more understanding flooded his awareness. It was happening because his flesh touched the flesh of the infant! He knew the infant\u0027s name now.\n \"Vata.\"\n A beautiful name. The name brought with it a blossoming mindful of information, as though the knowledge had always been there, needing only Vata\u0027s name and her touch to spread it through his memory. Now, he was aware of out, all of it as known through human senses and kelp memories ... because Vata carried kelp genes in her human flesh. He remembered the place of the kelp deep under the sea, the tendrils clinging to precious rock. He remembered the minuscule islands that no longer existed because the kelp was gone and the sea fury had been unleashed. Kelp memories and human memories revealed wondrous things happening to Pandora now that waves could roam freely around this planet, which was really a distorted ball of solid matter submerged in an endless skin of water.\n Duque knew where he was, too: in a small submersible, which should have had a Lighter-Than-Air carrier attached to it.\n Out was a place of marvels.\n And all of this wondrous information had come to him directly from the mind of Vata because she had kelp genes, as did he. As did many of Pandora\u0027s surviving humans. Genes ... he knew about those marvels, too, because Vata\u0027s mind was a magic storehouse of such things, telling him about history and the Clone Wars and the death of all the kelp. He sensed a direct link between Vata and himself, which endured even when he pulled away from physical contact with her. Duque experienced a great thankfulness for this and tried to express his gratitude but Vata refused to respond. He understood then that Vata wanted the deep sea-quiet of her kelp memories. She wanted only the waiting. She did not want to deal with the things she had dumped onto him. She had dumped them, he realized, shedding these things like a painful skin. Duque felt a momentary pique at this realization but happiness returned immediately. He was the repository of such wonders!\n Consciousness.\n That\u0027s my department, he thought. I must be aware for both of us. I am the storage system, the Ox Gate, which only Vata can open.\n There were giants in the earth in those days.\n - Genesis, The Christian Book of the Dead\n 22 Bunratti, 468.\n Why do I keep this journal? This is a strange hobby for the Chief Justice and Chairman of the Committee on Vital Forms. Do I hope that a historian will someday weave rich elaborations out of my poor scribblings? I can just see someone like Iz Bushka stumbling onto my journal many years from now, his mind crammed full of the preconceptions that block acceptance of the truly new. Would Bushka destroy my journal because it conflicted with his own theories? I think this may have happened with other historians in our past. Why else would Ship have forced us to start over? I\u0027m convinced that this is what Ship has done.\n Oh, I believe in Ship. Let it be recorded here and now that Ward Keel believes in Ship. Ship is God and Ship brought us here to Pandora. This is our ultimate trial - sink or swim, in the most literal sense. Well ... almost. We Islanders mostly float. It\u0027s the Mermen who swim.\n What a perfect testing ground for humankind is this Pandora, and how aptly named. Not a shard of land left above its sea, which the kelp once subdued. Once a noble creature, intelligent, known to all creatures of this world as Avata, it is now simply kelp - thick, green and silent. Our ancestors destroyed Avata and we inherited a planetary sea.\n Have we humans ever done that before? Have we killed off the thing that subdues the deadliness in our lives? Somehow, I suspect we have. Else, why would Ship leave those hybernation tanks to tantalize us in orbit just beyond our reach? Our Chaplain/Psychiatrist shares this suspicion. As she says, \"There is nothing new under the suns.\"\n I wonder why Ship\u0027s imprimatur always took the form of the eye within the pyramid?\n I began this journal simply as an account of my own stewardship on the Committee that determines which new life will be permitted to survive and perhaps breed. We mutants have a deep regard for the variations that the bioengineering of that brilliant madman, Jesus Lewis, set adrift in the human gene pool. From those incomplete records we still have, it\u0027s clear that human once had a much narrower definition. Mutant variations that we now accept without a passing glance were once cause for consternation, even death. As a Committeeman passing judgment on life, the question I always ask myself and try to answer with my poor understanding is: Will this new life, this infant, help us all survive? If there is the remotest chance that it will contribute to this thing we call human society I vote to let it live. And I have been rewarded time and again by that hidden genius in cruel form, that mind plus distorted body which enrich us all. I know I am correct in these decisions.\n But my journal has developed a tendency to wander. I have decided that I am secretly a philosopher. I want to know not only what, but why.\n In the long generations since that terrible night when the last of Pandora\u0027s true land-based islands exploded into molten lava, we have developed a peculiar social duality, which I am convinced could destroy us all. We Islanders, with our organic cities floating \"willy-nilly\" on the sea\u0027s surface, believe we have formed the perfect society. We care for each other, for the inner other that the skin (whatever shape or shade) protects. Then what is it about us that insists on saying \"us\" and \"them\"? Is there a viciousness buried in us? Will it explode us into violence against the excluded others?\n Oh, Islanders exclude; this cannot be denied. Our jokes betray us. Anti-Mermen jokes. \"Merms,\" we call them. Or \"pretties.\" And they call us \"Mutes.\" It\u0027s a grunt word no matter how you sound it.\n We are jealous of Mermen. There it is. I have written it. Jealous. They have the freedom of all the land beneath the sea. Merman mechanization depends on a relatively uniform, traditional human body. Few Islanders can compete under middleclass conditions, so they occupy the top of Merman genius or the depths of its slums. Even so, Islanders who migrate down under are confined to Islander communities ... ghettos. Still the Islander idea of heaven is to pass for a pretty.\n Mermen repel the sea to survive. Their living space benefits from a kind of stability underfoot. Historically, I must admit, humans show a preference for a firm surface underfoot, air to breathe freely (although theirs is depressingly damp) and solid things all around. They produce an occasional webbed foot or hand but that, too, was common all down the lineage of the species. Merman appearance is that of humans for as long as likenesses have been recorded; that much we can see for ourselves. Besides, Clone Wars happened. Our immediate ancestors wrote of this. Jesus Lewis did this to us. The visible evidence of other is inescapable.\n But I was writing about Merman nature. It is their self-proclaimed mission to restore the kelp. But will the kelp be conscious? Kelp once more lives in the sea. I have seen the effects in my lifetime and expect we\u0027ve just about seen the last of wavewalls. Exposed land will surely follow. Yet, how does that subtract from this nature that I see in the Mermen?\n By bringing back the kelp, they seek to control the sea. That is the Merman nature: control.\n Islanders float with the waves and the winds and the currents. Mermen would control these forces and control us.\n Islanders bend with things that might otherwise overwhelm them. They are accustomed to change but grow tired of it. Mermen fight against certain kinds of change - and are growing tired of that.\n Now, I come to my view of what Ship did with us. I think it is the nature of our universe that life may encounter a force that could overwhelm it if life cannot bend. Mermen would break before such a force. Islanders bend and drift. I think we may prove the better survivors.\n We bear our original sin in our bodies and on our faces.\n - Simone Rocksack, Chaplain/Psychiatrist\n The cold slap of a sudden wave over the side snapped Queets Twisp full awake. He yawned, unkinked his overlong arms where they had tangled themselves in the tarp. He wiped the spray from his face with his shirtsleeve. Not yet full sunrise, he noted. The first thin feathers of dawn tickled the black belly of the horizon. No thunderheads cluttered the sky and his two squawks, their feathers preened and glistening, muttered contentedly on their tethers. He rubbed the circulation back into his long arms and felt in the bottom of the coracle for his tube of thick juice concentrates and proteins.\n Blech.\n He made a wry face as he sucked down the last of the tube. The concentrate was tasteless and odorless, but he balked at it just the same.\n You\u0027d think if they made it edible they could make it palatable, he thought. At least dockside we\u0027ll get some real food. The rigors of setting and hauling fishing nets always built his appetite into a monumental thing that concentrates could support, but never satisfy.\n The gray ocean yawned away in all directions. Not a sign of dashers or any other threat anywhere. The occasional splatter of a sizable wave broke over the rim of the coracle but the organic pump in the bilge could handle that. He turned and watched the slaw bulge of their net foam the surface behind them. It listed slightly with its heavy load. Twisp\u0027s mouth watered at the prospect of a thousand kilos of scilla - boiled scilla, fried scilla, baked scilla with cream sauce and hot rolls ...\n \"Queets, are we there yet?\" Brett\u0027s voice cracked in its adolescent way. Only the shock of his thick blonde hair stuck out from under their tarp - a sharp contrast to Twisp\u0027s headful of ebony fur. Brett Norton was tall for sixteen, and his pile of hair made him seem even taller. This first season of fishing had already begun to fill in some of his thin, bony structure.\n Twisp sucked in a slow breath, partly to calm himself after being startled, partly to draw in patience.\n \"Not yet,\" he said. \"Drift is right. We should overtake the Island just after sunrise. Eat something.\"\n The boy grimaced and rummaged in his kit for his own meal. Twisp watched as the boy wiped the spout nearly clean, unstoppered it and sucked down great gulps of the untantalizing brown liquid.\n \"Yum.\"\n Brett\u0027s gray eyes were shut tight and he shuddered.\n Twisp smiled. I should quit thinking of him as \"the boy.\" Sixteen years was more than boyhood, and a season at the nets had hardened his eyes and thickened his hands.\n Twisp often wondered what had made Brett choose to be a fisherman. Brett was near enough to Merman body type that he could have gone down under and made a good life there.\n He\u0027s self-conscious about his eyes, Twisp thought. But that\u0027s something few people notice.\n Brett\u0027s gray eyes were large, but not grotesque. Those eyes could see well in almost total darkness, which turned out to be handy for round-the-clock fishing.\n That\u0027s something the Mermen wouldn\u0027t let out of their hands, Twisp thought. They\u0027re good at using people.\n A sudden lurch of the net caught both of them off-balance and they reached simultaneously for the rimline. Again, the lurch.\n \"Brett!\" Twisp shouted, \"Get us some slack while I haul in.\"\n \"But we can\u0027t haul in,\" the boy said, \"we\u0027d have to dump the catch ...\"\n \"There\u0027s a Merman in the net! A Merman will drown if we don\u0027t haul in.\" Twisp was already dragging in the heavy netlines hand-over-hand. The muscles of his long forearms nearly burst the skin with the effort. This was one of those times he was thankful he had a mutant\u0027s extra ability.\n Brett ducked out of sight behind him to man their small electric scull. The netlines telegraphed a frantic twisting and jerking from below.\n Merman for sure! Twisp thought, and strained even harder. He prayed he could get him up in time.\n Or her, he thought. The first Merman he\u0027d seen netbound was a woman. Beautiful. He shook off the memory of the crisscross lines, the net-burns in her perfect, pale ... dead skin. He hauled harder.\n Thirty meters of net to go, he thought. Sweat stung his eyes and small blades of pain seared his back.\n \"Queets!\"\n He looked from the net back to Brett and saw white-eyed terror. Twisp followed the boy\u0027s gaze. What he saw three or four hundred meters to starboard made him freeze. The squawks set up a fluttering outcry that told Twisp what his eyes were barely able to confirm.\n \"A hunt of dashers!\"\n He almost whispered it, almost let slip the netlines creasing his rock-hard palms.\n \"Help me here,\" Twisp shouted. He returned to the frantic tugging at the net. Out of the corner of one eye he saw the boy grab the port line, out of the other he watched the steady froth of the oncoming dashers.\n A half-dozen of them at least, he thought. Shit.\n \"What\u0027ll they do?\" Brett\u0027s voice cracked again.\n Twisp knew that the boy had heard stories. Nothing could match the real thing. Hungry or not, dashers hunted. Their huge forepaws and saberlike canines killed for the sheer bloody love of it. These dashers wanted that Merman.\n Too late, Twisp dove for the lasgun he kept wrapped in oiled cloth in the cuddy. Frantically, he scrabbled for the weapon, but the first of the dashers hit the net head-on and their momentum rocked the coracle. Two others fanned to the sides, closing on the flanks like a fist. Twisp felt the two hard hits as he came up with the lasgun. He saw the net go slack as slashing claws and fangs opened it wide. The rest of the hunt closed in, scavenging bits of meat and bone thrown clear of the frothy mess that had been a Merman. One dasher nipped another and, primed to kill, the rest turned on their wounded mate and tore him to bits. Fur and green gore splattered the side of the coracle.\n No need wasting a lasgun charge on that mess! It was a bitter thought. Islanders had long ago given up the hope they might exterminate these terrible creatures.\n Twisp shook himself alert, fumbled for his knife and cut the netlines.\n \"But why ... ?\"\n He didn\u0027t answer Brett\u0027s protest, but toggled a switch under the scull housing. One of the dashers froze not a meter from their gunwale. It sank slowly, drifting back and forth, back and forth like a feather falling on a breezeless day. The others made passes at the coracle but retreated once they felt the edge of the stunshield on their noses. They settled for the stunned dasher, then thrashed their way out to sea.\n Twisp rewrapped his lasgun and wedged it under his seat.\n He switched off the shield then and stared at the ragged shards that had been their net.\n \"Why\u0027d you cut loose the net?\" Brett\u0027s voice was petulant, demanding. He sounded near tears.\n Shock, Twisp thought. And losing the catch.\n \"They tore the net to get the ... to get him,\" Twisp explained. \"We\u0027d have lost the catch anyway.\"\n \"We could\u0027ve saved some of it,\" Brett muttered. \"A third of it was right here.\" Brett slapped the rimline at the stern, his eyes two gray threats against a harsh blue sky.\n Twisp sighed, aware that adrenaline could arouse frustrations that needed release.\n \"You can\u0027t activate a stunshield with the lines over the side like that,\" he explained. \"It\u0027s got to be all the way in or all the way out. With this cheap-ass model, anyway ...\" His fist slammed one of the thwarts.\n I\u0027m as shook as the kid, he thought. He took a deep breath, ran his fingers through the thick kinks of his black hair and calmed himself before activating the dasher-warning signal on his radio. That would locate them and reassure Vashon.\n \"They\u0027d have turned on us next,\" he said. He flicked a finger against the material between thwarts. \"This stuff is one thin membrane, two centimeters thick - what do you think our odds were?\"\n Brett lowered his eyes. He pursed his full lips, then stuck the lower lip out in a half-pout. His gaze looked away past a rising of Big Sun come to join its sister star already overhead. Below Big Sun, just ahead of the horizon, a large silhouette glowed orange in the water.\n \"Home,\" Twisp said quietly. \"The city.\"\n They were in one of the tight trade currents close to the surface. It would allow them to overtake the floating mass of humanity in an hour or two.\n \"Big fucking deal,\" Brett said. \"We\u0027re broke.\"\n Twisp smiled and leaned back to enjoy the suns.\n \"That\u0027s right,\" he said. \"And we\u0027re alive.\"\n The boy grunted and Twisp folded his meter-and-a-half arms behind his head. The elbows stuck out like two strange wings and cast a grotesque shadow on the water. He stared up across one of the elbows - caught as he sometimes was reflecting on the uniqueness of his mutant inheritance. These arms gangled in his way most of his life - he could touch his toes without bending over at all. But his arms hauled nets as though bred for it.\n Maybe they were, he mused. Who knows anymore? Handy mostly for nets and for reach, they made sleeping uncomfortable. Women seemed to like their strength and their wraparound quality, though. Compensation.\n Maybe it\u0027s the illusion of security, he thought, and his smile widened. His own life was anything but secure. Nobody who went down to the sea was secure, and anybody who thought so was either a fool or dead.\n \"What will Maritime Court do to us?\" Brett\u0027s voice was low, barely audible over the splashings of the waves and the continued ruffled mutterings of the two squawks.\n Twisp continued to enjoy the drift and the warm sunlight on his face and arms. He gnawed his thin lips for a blink, then said, \"Hard to say. Did you see a Merman marker?\"\n \"No.\"\n \"Do you see one now?\"\n He listened to the faint rustle across the coracle and knew that the boy scanned the horizon. Twisp had picked the boy for those exceptional eyes. That, and his attitude.\n \"Not a sign,\" the boy said. \"He must\u0027ve been alone.\"\n \"That\u0027s not likely,\" Twisp said. \"Mermen seldom travel alone. But it\u0027s a sure bet somebody\u0027s alone.\"\n \"Do we have to go to court?\"\n Twisp opened his eyes and saw the genuine fear in Brett\u0027s downturned mouth. The boy\u0027s wide eyes were impossible moons in his unstubbled face.\n \"Yep.\"\n Brett plopped down on the thwart beside Twisp, rocking the little boat so hard that water lapped over the sides.\n \"What if we don\u0027t tell?\" he asked. \"How would they know?\"\n Twisp turned away from the boy. Brett had a lot to learn about the sea, and those who worked it. There were many laws, and most of them stayed unwritten. This would be a hard first lesson, but what could you expect of a kid fresh from the inside? Things like this didn\u0027t happen at Center. Life there was ... nice. Scilla and muree were dinner to people living in the Island\u0027s inner circle, they weren\u0027t creatures with patterns and lives and a bright final flutter in the palm of the hand.\n \"Mermen keep track of everything,\" Twisp said flatly. \"They know.\"\n \"But the dashers,\" Brett insisted, \"maybe they got the other Merman, too. If there was another one.\"\n \"Dasher fur has hollow cells,\" Twisp said. \"For insulation and flotation. They can\u0027t dive worth a damn.\"\n Twisp leveled his black eyes at the kid and said, \"What about his family waiting back home? Now shut up.\"\n He knew the kid was hurt, but what the hell! If Brett was going to live on the sea he\u0027d better learn the way of it. Nobody liked being surprised out here, or abandoned. Nobody liked being boat-bound with a motor-mouth, either. Besides, Twisp was beginning to feel the proximity and inevitable discomfort of the Maritime Court, and he thought he\u0027d better start figuring out their case. Netting a Merman was serious business, even if it wasn\u0027t your fault.\n The fearful can be the most dangerous when they gain power. They become demoniac when they see the unpredictable workings of all that life around them. Seeing the strengths as well as the weaknesses, they fasten only on the weaknesses.\n - Shipquotes, the Histories\n Except for the movements of the operators, and their occasional comments, it was quiet in Sonde Control this morning, a stillness insulated from the daylight topside beneath a hundred meters of water and the thick walls of this Merman complex. The subdued remoteness filled Iz Bushka with disquiet. He knew his senses were being assaulted by Merman strangeness, an environment alien to most Islanders, but the exact source of his unease escaped him.\n Everything\u0027s so quiet, he thought.\n All that weight of water over his head gave Bushka no special concern. He had overcome that fear while doing his compulsory service in the Islander subs. The attitude of superiority that he could detect in the Mermen around him, that was the source of his annoyance! Bushka glanced left to where his fellow observers stood slightly apart, keeping their distance from the lone Islander in this company.\n GeLaar Gallow leaned close to the woman beside him, Kareen Ale, and asked: \"Why is the launch delayed?\"\n Ale spoke in a softly modulated voice: \"I heard someone say there was an order from the Chaplain/Psychiatrist - something about the blessing.\"\n Gallow nodded and a lock of blonde hair dropped to his right eyebrow. He brushed it back with a casual movement. Gallow was quite the most beautiful human male Bushka had ever seen - a Greek god, if the histories were to be credited. As an Islander historian by avocation, Bushka believed the histories. Gallow\u0027s golden hair was long and softly waved. His dark blue eyes looked demandingly at everything they encountered. His even, white teeth flashed smiles that touched nothing but his mouth, as though he displayed the perfect teeth in that perfect face only for the benefit of onlookers. Some said he had been operated on to remove webs from fingers and toes but that could be a jealous lie.\n Bushka studied Ale covertly. It was said that Mermen were petitioning Ale to mate with Gallow for the sake of beautiful offspring. Ale\u0027s face was an exquisitely proportioned oval with full lips, widely spaced blue eyes. Her nose, slightly upturned, showed a smooth and straight ridgeline. Her skin - perfectly set off by her dark red hair - was a pinkish translucence that Bushka thought would require salves and ointments when her duties took her topside into the harsh presence of the suns.\n Bushka looked past them at the giant console with its graphic operational keys and large screens. One screen showed brilliant light on the ocean surface far above them. Another screen revealed the undersea tube where the Lighter-Than-Air hydrogen sonde was being prepared for its upward drift and launch into Pandora\u0027s turbulent atmosphere. A thin forest of kelp wavered in the background.\n On Bushka\u0027s right, a triple thickness of plazglas also revealed the LTA launch base with Mermen swimming around it. Some of the swimmers wore prestubes for oxygen, all encased in their tight-fitting dive suits. Others carried across their backs the organic airfish that Islander bioengineering had pioneered for sustained work undersea.\n We can produce it, but we cannot have the freedom of the undersea in which to use it.\n Bushka could see where the leechmouth of an airfish attached itself to a nearby Merman\u0027s carotid artery. He imagined the thousands of cilia pumping fresh oxygen into the worker\u0027s bloodstream. Occasionally, a worker equipped with an airfish vented carbon dioxide in a stream of drifting bubbles from the corner of his mouth.\n How does it feel to float freely in the sea, dependent on the symbiotic relationship with an airfish? It was a thought full of Islander resentments. Islander bioengineering surpassed that of the Mermen, but everything Islander genius produced was gobbled up in the terrible need for valuable exchange. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-lazarus-effect-destination-void-3/page-1.html","bookId":2171,"book":{"id":2171,"title":"The Lazarus Effect (Destination: Void #3)","description":"Storyline: \n The Lazarus Effect (Destination: Void #3) \n The Histories assert that a binary system cannot support life. But we found life here on Pandora. Except for the kelp, it was antagonistic and deadly, but still it was life. Ship\u0027s judgment is upon us now because we wiped out the kelp and unbalanced this world. We few survivors are subject to the endless sea and the terrible vagaries of the two suns. That we survive at all on our fragile Clone-rafts is as much a curse as a victory. This is the time of madness. Hali Ekel, the Journals Duque smelled burning flesh and scorched hair. He sniffed, sniffed again, and whined. His one good eye watered and pained him when he tried to knuckle it open. His mother was out. Out was a word he could say, like hot and Ma. He could not precisely identify the location and shape of out. He knew vaguely that his quarters were on a Clone-raft anchored off a black stone pinnacle, all that remained of Pandora\u0027s land surface.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-lazarus-effect-destination-void-3.jpg","author":"Frank Herbert","type":"Fantasy","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-lazarus-effect-destination-void-3.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:25 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:37:04 PM"}}
