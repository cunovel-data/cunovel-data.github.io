{"id":98894,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"The touch of the infant teaches birth, and our hands are witness to the lesson.\\n\\n - Kerro Panille, the Histories\\n\\n Vata did not experience true consciousness. She skirted the shadow-edges of awareness. Memories flitted through her neurons like tendrils from the kelp. Sometimes she dreamed kelp dreams. These dreams often included a wondrous hatch of hylighters - spore-filled gasbags that had died when the original kelp died. Tears mixed with her nutrient bath as she dreamed such things, tears for the fate of those huge sky-bound globes tacking across the evening breezes of a million years. Her dream hylighters clutched their ballast rocks in their two longest tentacles and Vata felt the comforting texture of rock hugged close.\\n\\n Thoughts themselves were like hylighters to her, or silken threads blowing in the dark of her mind. Sometimes she followed awareness of Duque, who floated beside her, sensing events within his thoughts. Time and again, she re-experienced through him that terrible night when the gravitational wrenching of Pandora\u0027s two suns destroyed the last human foothold on the planet\u0027s fragile land. Duque repeatedly let his thoughts plunge into that experience. And Vata, linked to the fearful mutant like Mermen diving partners on the same safety line, was forced to recreate dreams that soothed and calmed Duque\u0027s terrors.\\n\\n \"Duque escaped,\" she muttered in his mind, \"Duque was taken away onto the sea where Hali Ekel tended his burns.\"\\n\\n Duque would snuffle and whimper. Had Vata been conscious, she would have heard with her own ears, because Vata and Duque shared the same life support at the center of Vashon. Vata lay mostly submerged in nutrient, a monstrous mound of pink and blue flesh with definite human female characteristics. Enormous breasts with gigantic pink nipples lifted from the dark nutrient like twin mountains from a brown sea. Duque drifted beside her, a satellite, her familiar dangling in the endless mental vacuum.\\n\\n For generations now, the two of them had been nurtured and reverenced in Vashon\u0027s central complex - home of the Chaplain/Psychiatrist and the Committee on Vital Forms, Merman and Islander guards kept watch on the pair under the command of the C/P. It was a ritualized observation, which, in time, eroded the awe that Pandorans learned early from the reactions of their parents.\\n\\n \"The two of them there like that. They\u0027ll always be there. They\u0027re our last link with Ship. As long as they live, Ship is with us. It\u0027s WorShip keeps them alive so long.\"\\n\\n Although Duque occasionally knuckled an eye into glaring wakefulness and watched his guardians in the gloomy surroundings of the living pool that confined them, Vata\u0027s responses never lifted to consciousness. She breathed. Her great body, responding to the kelp half of her genetic inheritance, absorbed energy from the nutrient solution that washed against her skin. Analysis of the nutrient betrayed traces of human waste products, which were removed by the sucker mouths of blind scrubberfish. Occasionally, Vata would snort and an arm would lift in the nutrient like a leviathan rising from its depths before settling once more into the murk. Her hair continued to grow until it spread like kelp across the nutrient surface, tangling over the hairless skin of Duque and impeding the scrubberfish. The C/P would come into the chamber then and, with a reverence touched by a certain amount of cupidity, would clip Vata\u0027s locks. The strands were washed and separated to be blessed and sold in short lengths as indulgences. Even Mermen bought them. Sale of Vatahair had been the major source of C/P income for many generations.\\n\\n Duque, more aware than any other human of his curious link with Vata, puzzled over the connection when Vata\u0027s intrusions left him with thinking time of his own. Sometimes he would speak of this to his guardians, but when Duque spoke there was always a flurry of activity, the summoning of the C/P, and a different kind of watchfulness from the security.\\n\\n \"She lives me,\" he said once, and this became a token label inscribed on the Vatahair containers.\\n\\n In these speaking times, the C/P would try prepared questions, sometimes booming them at Duque, sometimes asking in a low and reverential voice.\\n\\n \"Do you speak for Vata, Duque?\"\\n\\n \"I speak.\"\\n\\n That was all they ever got from him on this question. Since it was known that Duque was one of the hundred or so original mutants who had been conceived with kelp intervention and thus bore kelp genes, they would sometimes ask him about the kelp that had once ruled Pandora\u0027s now-endless sea.\\n\\n \"Do you have memory of the kelp, Duque?\"\\n\\n \"Avata,\" Duque corrected. \"I am the rock.\"\\n\\n Interminable arguments came out of this answer. \"Avata had been the kelp\u0027s name for itself. The reference to rock gave scholars and theologians room for speculation.\\n\\n \"He must mean that his consciousness exists at the bottom of the sea where the kelp lives.\"\\n\\n \"No! Remember how the kelp always clung to a rock, lifting its tendrils to the sunlight? And the hylighters used rock for ballast ...\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re all wrong. He\u0027s Vata\u0027s grip on life. He\u0027s Vata\u0027s rock.\"\\n\\n And there was always someone who would harken back to WorShip and the stories of that distant planet where someone calling himself Peter had given the same answer Duque had given.\\n\\n Nothing was ever solved by such arguments, but the questioning continued whenever Duque showed signs of wakefulness.\\n\\n \"How is it that you and Vata do not die, Duque?\"\\n\\n \"We wait.\"\\n\\n \"For what do you wait?\"\\n\\n \"No answer.\"\\n\\n This recurrent response precipitated several crises until the C/P of that time issued an order that Duque\u0027s answers could only be broadcast by permission of the C/P. This didn\u0027t stop the quiet whispering and the rumors, of course, but it relegated everything except the C/P\u0027s official version to the role of mystical heresy. It was a question no C/P had asked for two generations now. Current interest centered much more on the kelp that Mermen spread far and wide in Pandora\u0027s planetary sea. The kelp was thick and healthy, but showed no signs of acquiring consciousness.\\n\\n As the great Islands drifted they were seldom out of sight of a horizon touched by the oily green flatness of a kelp bed. Everyone said it was a good thing. Kelp formed nurseries for fish and everyone could see there were more fish these days, though they weren\u0027t always easy to catch. You couldn\u0027t use a net amongst the kelp. Baited lines tangled in the huge fronds and were lost. Even the dumb muree had learned to retreat into kelp sanctuary at the approach of fishermen.\\n\\n There was also the recurrent question of Ship, Ship who was God and who had left humankind on Pandora.\\n\\n \"Why did Ship abandon us here, Duque?\"\\n\\n All Duque would ever say was: \"Ask Ship.\"\\n\\n Many a C/P had engaged in much silent prayer over that one. But Ship did not answer them. At least, not with any voice that they could hear.\\n\\n It was a vexing question. Would Ship return? Ship had left the hyb tanks in orbit around Pandora. It was a strange orbit, seeming to defy the gravitational index for such things. There were those among Pandora\u0027s Mermen and Islanders who said Vata waited for the hyb tanks to be brought down, that she would awaken when this occurred.\\n\\n No one doubted there was some link between Duque and Vata, so why not a link between Vata and the dormant life waiting up there in the tanks?\\n\\n \"How are you linked to Vata?\" a C/P asked.\\n\\n \"How are you linked to me?\" Duque responded.\\n\\n This was duly recorded in the Book of Duque and more arguments ensued. It was noted, however, that whenever such questions were asked, Vata stirred. Sometimes grossly and sometimes with only the faintest movement over her vast flesh.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s like the safety line we use between divers down under,\" an astute Merman observed. \"You can always find your partner.\"\\n\\n Vata\u0027s tendril-awareness stirred to the linkage with genetic memories of mountain climbers. They were climbing, she and Duque. This she showed him many times. Her memories, shared with Duque, showed a spectacular world of the vertical that Islanders could barely imagine and holes did not do justice. Only, she did not think of herself as one of the climbers, or even think of herself at all. There was only the line, and the climbing.\\n\\n First, we had to develop a landless life-style; second, we preserved what technology and hardware we could salvage. Lewis left us with a team of bioengineers - both our curse and our most powerful legacy. We do not dare plunge our few precious children into a Stone Age.\\n\\n - Hali Ekel, the Journals\\n\\n Ward Keel looked down from the high bench and surveyed the two young petitioners in front of him. The male was a large Merman with the tattoo of a criminal on his brow, a wine-red \"E\" for \"Expatriate.\" This Merman could never return to the rich land under the sea and he knew the Islanders accepted him only for his stabilizing genes. Those genes had not stabilized this time. The Merman probably knew what the judgment would be. He patted a damp cloth nervously over his exposed skin.\\n\\n The woman petitioner, his mate, was small and slender with pale blonde hair and two slight indentations where she should have had eyes. She wore a long blue sari and when she walked Keel did not hear steps, only a rasping scrape. She swayed from side to side and hummed to herself.\\n\\n Why does this one have to be the first case of the morning? Keel wondered. It was a perverse fate. This morning of all mornings!\\n\\n \"Our child deserves to live!\" the Merman said. His voice boomed in the chambers. The Committee on Vital Forms often heard such loud protestation but this time Keel felt that the volume was directed at the woman, telling her that her mate fought for them both.\\n\\n As Chief Justice of the Committee it was too often Keel\u0027s lot to perform that unsavory stroke of the pen, to speak directly the unutterable fears of the petitioners themselves. Many times it was otherwise and then this chamber echoed the laughter of life. But today, in this case, there would be no laughter. Keel sighed. The Merman, even though a criminal by Merman ruling, made this matter politically sensitive. Mermen were jealous of the births that they called \"normal,\" and they monitored every topside birth involving Merman parentage.\\n\\n \"We have studied your petition with great care,\" Keel said. He glanced left and right at his fellow Committee members. They sat impassively, attention elsewhere - on the great curve of bubbly ceiling, on the soft living deck, on the records stacked in front of them - everywhere but on the petitioners. The dirty work was being left to Ward Keel.\\n\\n If they only knew, Keel thought. A higher Committee on Vital Forms has today passed judgment on me ... as it will pass judgment on them, eventually. He felt a deep compassion for the petitioners in front of him but there was no denying the judgment.\\n\\n \"The Committee has determined that the subject\" - not \"the child,\" he thought -\"is merely a modified gastrula ...\"\\n\\n \"We want this child!\" The man fisted the rail that separated him from the Committee\u0027s high bench. The security guardians at the rear of the chambers came to attention. The woman continued to hum and sway, not in time with the music that came from her lips.\\n\\n Keel leafed through a stack of plaz records and pulled out a sheet thick with figures and graphs.\\n\\n \"The subject has been found to have a nuclear construction that harbors a reagent gene,\" he reported. \"This construction insures that the cellular material will turn on itself, destroying its own cell walls ...\"\\n\\n \"Then let us have our child until that death,\" the man blurted. He swiped at his face with the damp cloth. \"For the love of humanity, give us that much.\"\\n\\n \"Sir,\" Keel said, \"for the love of humanity I cannot. We have determined that this construction is communicable should there be any major viral invasion of the subject ...\"\\n\\n \"Our child! Not a subject! Our child!\"\\n\\n \"Enough!\" Keel snapped. Security moved silently into the aisle behind the Merman. Keel tapped the bell beside him and all stirring in the chamber ceased. \"We are sworn to protect human life, to perpetuate life forms that are not lethal deviants.\"\\n\\n The Merman father stared upward, awed at the invocation of these terrible powers. Even his mate stopped her gentle swaying, but a faint hum still issued from her mouth.\\n\\n Keel wanted to shout down at them, \"I am dying, right here in front of you. I am dying.\" But he bit back the impulse and decided that if he were going to give in to hysteria he\u0027d do it in his own quarters.\\n\\n Instead, he said, \"We are empowered to carry out measures in the extreme to see that humankind survives this genetic mess we inherited from Jesus Lewis.\" He leaned back and steadied the shaking in his hands and voice. \"We are in no way refreshed by a negative decision. Take your woman home. Care for her ...\"\\n\\n \"I want one ...\"\\n\\n The bell rang again, cutting the man short.\\n\\n Keel raised his voice: \"Usher! See these people out. They will be given the usual priorities. Terminate the subject, retaining all materials as stated in Vital Form Orders, subparagraph B. Recess.\"\\n\\n Keel arose and swept past the other Committee members without a glance at the rest of the chambers. The grunts and struggles of the heartsick Merman echoed and re-echoed down the corridors of Keel\u0027s anguished mind.\\n\\n As soon as he was alone in his office, Keel unstoppered a small flask of boo and poured himself a stiff shot. He tossed it back, shuddered and caught his breath as the warm clear liquid eased into his bloodstream. He sat in the special chair at his desk then, eyes closed, and rested his long, thin neck against the molded supports that took the weight of his massive head.\\n\\n He could not make a lethal decision as he had done this morning without recalling the moment when he, as an infant, had come before the Committee on Vital Forms. People said it was not possible for him to remember that scene, but he did remember it - not in bits and sketches, but in its entirety. His memory went back into the womb, through a calm birth into a gloomy delivery room and the glad awakening at his mother\u0027s breast. And he remembered the judgment of the Committee. They had been worried about the size of his head and the length of his thin neck. Would prosthetics compensate? He had understood the words, too. There was language in him from some genetic well and although he could not speak until growth caught up with what had been born in him, he knew those words.\\n\\n \"This infant is unique,\" that old Chief Justice had said, reading from the medical report. \"His intestines must have periodic implantation of a remora to supply missing bile and enzyme factors.\"\\n\\n The Chief Justice had looked down then, a giant behind that enormous and remote bench, and his gaze had fixed on the naked infant in its mother\u0027s arms.\\n\\n \"Legs, thick and stubby. Feet deformed - one-joint toes, six toes, six fingers. Torso overlong, waist pinched in. Face rather small in that ...\" the Justice cleared his throat, \"enormous head.\" The Justice had looked at Keel\u0027s mother then, noting the extremely wide pelvis. Obvious anatomical questions had lain unspoken in the man\u0027s mind.\\n\\n \"In spite of these difficulties, this subject is not a lethal deviant.\" The words issuing from the Justice\u0027s mouth had all been in the medical report. Keel, when he came to the Committee as a member, fished out his own report, reading it with a detached curiosity.\\n\\n \"Face rather small ...\" These were the very words in the report, just as he remembered them. \"Eyes, one brown and one blue.\" Keel smiled at the memory. His eyes -\"one brown and one blue\" - could peek around from the nearly squared edges of his temples, allowing him to look almost straight back without turning his head. His lashes were long and drooping. When he relaxed, they fuzzed his view of the world. Time had put smile wrinkles at the corners of his wide, thick-lipped mouth. And his flat nose, nearly a handsbreadth wide, had grown until it stopped just short of his mouth. The whole face, he knew from comparisons, was oddly pinched together, top to bottom, as though put on his head as an afterthought. But those corner-placed eyes, they were the dominant feature - alert and wise.\\n\\n They let me live because I looked alert, he thought.\\n\\n This was a thing he, too, sought in the subjects brought before him. Brains. Intelligence. That was what humankind required to get them out of this mess. Brawn and dexterity, too, but these were useless without the intelligence to guide them.\\n\\n Keel closed his eyes and sank his neck even deeper into the cushioned supports. The boo was having its desired effect. He never drank the stuff without thinking how strange it was that this should come from the deadly nerve runners that had terrified his ancestors in the pioneer days of Pandora when real land protruded above the sea.\\n\\n \"Worm hordes,\" the first observers had called them. The worm hordes attacked warm life and ate out every nerve cell, working their way to the succulent brain where they encysted their clutches of eggs. Even dashers feared them. Came the endless sea, though, and nerve runners retreated to a subsea vector whose fermentation by-product was boo - sedative, narcotic, \"happy juice.\"\\n\\n He fondled the small glass and took another sip.\\n\\n The door behind him opened and a familiar footstep entered - familiar swish of garments, familiar smells. He didn\u0027t open his eyes, thinking what a singular mark of trust that was, even for an Islander.\\n\\n Or on Invitation, he thought.\\n\\n The beginnings of a wry smile touched the corners of his mouth. He felt the tingling of the boo in his tongue and fingertips. Now in his toes.\\n\\n Baring my neck for the axe?\\n\\n There was always guilt after a negative decision. Always at least the unconscious desire for expiation. Well, it was all there in the Committee\u0027s orders, but he was not fool enough to retreat into that hoary old excuse: \"I was just obeying orders.\"\\n\\n \"May I get you something, Justice?\" The voice was that of his aide and sometimes-lover, Joy Marcoe.\\n\\n \"No, thank you,\" he murmured.\\n\\n She touched his shoulder. \"The Committee would like to reconvene in quarters at eleven hundred hours. Should I tell them you\u0027re too ... ?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll be there.\" He kept his eyes closed and heard her start to leave. \"Joy,\" he called, \"have you ever thought how ironic it is that you, with your name, work for this Committee?\"\\n\\n She returned to his side and he felt her hand on his left arm. It was a trick of the boo that he felt the hand melt into his senses - more than a touch, she caressed a vital core of his being.\\n\\n \"Today is particularly hard,\" she said. \"But you know how rare that is, anymore.\" She waited, he presumed, for his response. Then when none came: \"I think Joy is a perfect name for this job. It reminds me of how much I want to make you happy.\"\\n\\n He managed a weak smile and adjusted his head in the supports. He couldn\u0027t bring himself to tell her about his own medical reports - the final verdict. \"You do bring me joy,\" he said. \"Wake me at ten-forty-five.\"\\n\\n She dimmed the light when she left.\\n\\n The mobile device that supported his head began to irritate the base of his neck where it pressed into the chair\u0027s supports. He inserted a finger under the chair\u0027s cushions and adjusted one of the contraption\u0027s fastenings. Relief on his left side was transmitted to irritation on the right. He sighed and poured another short dash of boo.\\n\\n When he lifted the slender glass, the dimmed overhead light shot blue-gray sparkles through the liquid. It looked cool, as refreshing as a supportive bath on a hot day when the double suns burned through the clouds.\\n\\n What warmth the tiny glass contained! He marveled at the curve of his thin fingers around the stem. One fingernail peeled back where he had snagged it on his robe. Joy would clip and bind it when she returned, he knew. He did not doubt that she had noted it. This had happened often enough, though, that she knew it did not pain him.\\n\\n His own reflection in the curvature of the glass caught his attention. The curve exaggerated the wide spacing of his eyes. The long lashes drooping almost to the bend of his cheeks receded into tiny points. He strained to focus on the glass so close in front of him. His nose was a giant thing. He brought the glass to his lips and the image fuzzed out, vanished.\\n\\n Small wonder that Islanders avoid mirrors, he thought.\\n\\n He had a fascination with his own reflection, though, and often caught himself staring at his features in shiny surfaces.\\n\\n That such a distorted creature should be allowed to live! The long-ago judgment of that earlier Committee filled him with wonder. Did those Committee members know that he would think and hurt and love? He felt that the often-shapeless blobs that appeared before his Committee bore kinship to all humanity if only they showed evidence of thought, love and the terribly human capacity to be hurt.\\n\\n From some dim passageway beyond his doors or, perhaps, from somewhere deep in his own mind, the soft tones of a fine set of water-drums nestled him into his cushions and drowsed him away.\\n\\n Half-dreams flickered in and out of his consciousness, becoming presently a particularly soothing full-dream of Joy Marcoe and himself rolling backward on her bed. Her robe fell open to the smooth softness of aroused flesh and Keel felt the unmistakable stirrings of his body - the body in the chair and the body in the dream. He knew it was a dream of the memory of their first exploratory sharing. His hand slipped beneath her robe and pulled the softness of her against him, stroking her back. That had been the moment when he discovered the secret of Joy\u0027s bulky clothes, the clothes that could not hide an occasional firm trim line of hips or thighs, the small strong arms. Joy cradled a third breast under her left armpit. In the dream of the memory, she giggled nervously as his wandering hand found the tiny nipple hardening between his fingers.\\n\\n Mr. Justice.\\n\\n It was Joy\u0027s voice, but it was wrong.\\n\\n That was not what she said.\\n\\n \"Mr. Justice.\"\\n\\n A hand shook his left arm. He felt the chair and the prosthetics, a pain where his neck joined the massive head.\\n\\n \"Ward, it\u0027s wake-up. The Committee meets in fifteen minutes.\"\\n\\n He blinked awake. Joy stood over him, smiling, her hand still on his arm.\\n\\n \"Nodded off,\" he said. He yawned behind his hand. \"I was dreaming about you.\"\\n\\n A distinctive flush darkened her cheeks. \"Something nice, I hope.\"\\n\\n He smiled. \"How could a dream with you in it be anything but nice?\"\\n\\n The blush deepened and her gray eyes glittered.\\n\\n \"Flattery will get you anything, Mr. Justice.\" She patted his arm. \"After Committee, you have a call to Kareen Ale. Her office said she would arrive here at thirteen-thirty. I told them you have a full appointment sheet through ...\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll see her,\" he said. He stood and steadied himself on the edge of his desk console. The boo always made him a little groggy at first recovery. Imagine the medics giving him their death sentence and then telling him to knock off the boo! Avoid extremes, avoid anxiety.\\n\\n \"Kareen Ale takes advantage of her position to presume on your good nature and waste your time,\" Joy said.\\n\\n Keel didn\u0027t like the way Joy exaggerated the Merman ambassador\u0027s name: \"ah-lay.\" True, it was a difficult name to carry through the cocktail parties of the diplomatic corps, but the woman had Keel\u0027s complete respect on the debating floor.\\n\\n He was suddenly aware that Joy was leaving.\\n\\n \"Joy!\" he called. \"Allow me to cook for you in quarters tonight.\"\\n\\n Her back straightened in the doorway and when she turned to face him she smiled. \"I\u0027d like that very much. What time?\"\\n\\n \"Nineteen hundred?\"\\n\\n She nodded once, firmly, and left. It was just the economy of movement and grace that endeared her to him. She was less than half his age, but she carried a wisdom about her that age ignored. He tried to remember how long it had been since he\u0027d taken a full-time lover.\\n\\n Twelve years? No, thirteen.\\n\\n Joy made the wait that much more right in his mind. Her body was supple and completely hairless - something that excited him in ways he\u0027d thought he\u0027d forgotten.\\n\\n He sighed, and tried to get his mind set for the coming meeting with the Committee.\\n\\n Old farts, he thought. One corner of his mouth twisted up in spite of himself. But they\u0027re pretty interesting old farts.\\n\\n The five Committee members were among the most powerful people on Vashon. Only one person rivaled Keel, with his position as Chief Justice - Simone Rocksack, the Chaplain/Psychiatrist, who commanded great popular support and provided a check on the power of the Committee. Simone could move things by inference and innuendo; Keel could order them done and they were done.\\n\\n Keel realized, with some curiosity, that as well as he knew the Committee members, he always had trouble remembering their faces. Well ... faces were not all that important. It was what lay behind the face that mattered. He touched a finger to his nose, to his distended forehead, and as though it were a magic gesture his hand called up a clear image of those other faces, those four old justices.\\n\\n There was Alon, the youngest of them at sixty-seven. Alon Matts, Vashon\u0027s leading bioengineer for nearly thirty years.\\n\\n Theodore Carp was the cynic of the group and, so Keel thought, aptly named. Others referred to Carp as \"Fish Man,\" a product of both his appearance and his bearing. Carp looked fishlike. A sickly-pale, nearly translucent skin covered the long narrow face and blunt-fingered hands. The cuffs of his robe came nearly to the tips of his fingers and his hands appeared quite finlike at first glance. His lips were full and wide, and they never smiled. He had never been considered seriously for Chief Justice.\\n\\n Not a political enough animal, Keel thought. No matter how bad things get, you\u0027ve got to smile sometime. He shook his head and chuckled to himself. Maybe that should be one of the Committee\u0027s criteria for passing questionable subjects - the ability to smile, to laugh ...\\n\\n \"Ward,\" a voice called, \"I swear you\u0027ll daydream your life away.\"\\n\\n He turned and saw the other two justices walking the hallway behind him. Had he passed them in the hatchway and not noticed? Possibly.\\n\\n \"Carolyn,\" he said, and nodded, \"and Gwynn. Yes, with luck I\u0027ll daydream my life away. Are you refreshed after this morning\u0027s session?\"\\n\\n Carolyn Bluelove turned her eyeless face up to his and sighed. \"A difficult morning,\" she said. \"Clear-cut, of course, but difficult ...\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t see why you go through a hearing, Ward,\" Gwynn Erdsteppe said. \"You just make yourself uncomfortable, it makes us all uncomfortable. We shouldn\u0027t have to whip ourselves over something like that. Can\u0027t we channel the drama outside the chambers?\"\\n\\n \"They have their right to be heard, and the right to hear something as irreversible as our decision from those who make it,\" he said. \"Otherwise, what might we become? The power over life and death is an awesome one, and it should have all the checks against it that we can muster. That\u0027s one decision that should never be easy.\"\\n\\n \"So what are we?\" Gwynn persisted.\\n\\n \"Gods,\" Carolyn snapped. She put her hand on Keel\u0027s arm and said, \"Walk these two dottering old gods to chambers, will you, Mr. Justice?\"\\n\\n \"Delighted,\" he said. They scuff-scuffed down the hallway, their bare feet hardly more than sighs on the soft deck.\\n\\n Ahead of them, a team of slurry workers painted nutrient on the walls. This team used broad brushes and laid on vivid strokes of deep blue, yellow and green. In a week all the color would be absorbed and the walls returned to their hungry, gray-brown hue.\\n\\n Gwynn positioned herself behind Keel and Carolyn. Her lumbering pace hurried them on. Keel was distracted from Carolyn\u0027s small talk by the constant lurch of Gwynn\u0027s hulk behind them.\\n\\n \"Do either of my fellow justices know why we\u0027re meeting just now?\" he asked. \"It must be something disturbing because Joy didn\u0027t reveal it when she told me about the appointment.\"\\n\\n \"That Merman this morning, he\u0027s appealed to the Chaplain/Psychiatrist,\" Gwynn snorted. \"Why won\u0027t they leave it be?\"\\n\\n \"Curious,\" Carolyn said.\\n\\n It struck Keel as very curious. He had sat the bench for a full five years before a case had been appealed to the Chaplain/Psychiatrist. But this year ...\\n\\n \"The C/P\u0027s just a figurehead,\" Gwynn said. \"Why do they waste their time and ours on -\"\\n\\n \"And hers,\" Carolyn interrupted. \"It\u0027s a lot of work, being the emissary to the gods.\"\\n\\n Keel shuffled quietly between them while they reopened the ages-old debate. He tuned it out, as he\u0027d learned to do years ago. People filled his life too much to leave any time for gods. Especially now - this day when the life burning inside him had become doubly precious.\\n\\n Eight cases appealed by the C/P in this season alone, he thought. And all eight involved Mermen.\\n\\n The realization made him extremely interested in the afternoon meeting with Kareen Ale, which was to follow this appeals hearing.\\n\\n The three justices entered the hatchway to their smaller chambers. It was an informational room - small, well-lit, the walls lined with books, tapes, holos and other communications equipment. Matts and the Fish Man were already watching Simone Rocksack\u0027s introductory remarks on the large view-screen. She would, of course, use the Vashon intercom. The C/P seldom left her quarters near the tank that sustained Vata and Duque. The four protrusions that made up most of the C/P\u0027s face bent and waved as she talked. Her two eye protuberances were particularly active.\\n\\n Keel and the others seated themselves quietly. Keel raised the back of his chair to ease the strain on his neck and its support.\\n\\n \"... and further, that they were not even allowed to view the child. Is that not somewhat harsh treatment from a Committee entrusted with sensitive care of our life forms?\"\\n\\n Carp was quick to respond. \"It was a gastrula, Simone, purely and simply a lump of cells with a hole in it. There was nothing to be gained by bringing the creature into public view ...\"\\n\\n \"The creature\u0027s parents hardly constitute a public viewing, Mr. Justice. And don\u0027t forget the association of Creator and creature. Lest you forget, sir, I am a Chaplain/Psychiatrist. While you may have certain prejudices regarding my religious role, I assure you that my preparation as a psychiatrist is most thorough. When you denied that young couple the sight of their offspring, you denied them a good-bye, a closure, a finality that would help them grieve and get on with their lives. Now there will be counseling, tears and nightmares far beyond the normal scope of mourning.\"\\n\\n Gwynn picked up at the C/P\u0027s first pause.\\n\\n \"This doesn\u0027t sound like an appeal for the life form in question. Since that is the express function of an appeal, I must ask your intentions here. Is it possible that you\u0027re simply trying to go on record as establishing a political platform out of the appeals process?\"\\n\\n The nodules on the C/P\u0027s face retracted as if struck, then slowly re-emerged at the ends of their long stalks.\\n\\n A good psychiatrist has a face you can\u0027t read, Keel thought. Simone certainly fills the bill.\\n\\n The C/P\u0027s voice came on again in its wet, slurpy fashion. \"I defer to the decision of the Chief Justice in this matter.\"\\n\\n Keel snapped fully awake. This was certainly an unlikely turn of argument - if it was argument. He cleared his throat and gave his full attention to the screen. Those four nodules seemed to hunt out the gaze of both his eyes and fix on his mouth at the same time. He cleared his throat again.\\n\\n \"Your Eminence,\" he said, \"it is clear that we did not proceed with this case in the most sensitive fashion. I speak for the Committee when I voice my appreciation for your candid appraisal of the matter. Sometimes, in the anguish of our task, we lose sight of the difficulty imposed upon others. Your censure, for lack of a better word, is noted and will be acted on. However, Justice Erdsteppe\u0027s point is well made. You dilute the appeals process by bringing before us matters that do not, in fact, constitute an appeal on behalf of a condemned lethal deviant. Do you wish to proceed with such an appeal in this case?\"\\n\\n There was a pause from the viewscreen, then a barely audible sigh. \"No, Mr. Justice, I do not. I have seen the reports and, in this case, I concur with your findings.\"\\n\\n Keel heard the low grumbling from Carp and Gwynn beside him.\\n\\n \"Perhaps we should meet informally and discuss these matters,\" he said. \"Would that be to your liking, Your Eminence?\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-lazarus-effect-destination-void-3/page-3.html","bookId":2171,"book":{"id":2171,"title":"The Lazarus Effect (Destination: Void #3)","description":"Storyline: The Lazarus Effect (Destination: Void #3) \\n The Histories assert that a binary system cannot support life. But we found life here on Pandora. Except for the kelp, it was antagonistic and deadly, but still it was life. Ship\u0027s judgment is upon us now because we wiped out the kelp and unbalanced this world. We few survivors are subject to the endless sea and the terrible vagaries of the two suns. That we survive at all on our fragile Clone-rafts is as much a curse as a victory. This is the time of madness. Hali Ekel, the Journals Duque smelled burning flesh and scorched hair. He sniffed, sniffed again, and whined. His one good eye watered and pained him when he tried to knuckle it open. His mother was out. Out was a word he could say, like hot and Ma. He could not precisely identify the location and shape of out. He knew vaguely that his quarters were on a Clone-raft anchored off a black stone pinnacle, all that remained of Pandora\u0027s land surface.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-lazarus-effect-destination-void-3.jpg","author":"Frank Herbert","type":"Fantasy","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-lazarus-effect-destination-void-3.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:25 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:37:04 PM"}}
