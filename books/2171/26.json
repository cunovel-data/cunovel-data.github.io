{"id":98917,"no":26,"title":"Page 26","content":"\"Look at yourself,\" Gallow said. \"Your neck can\u0027t support your head without that ... thing. Your eyes are on the sides of your head -\"\n \"They\u0027re different colors, too,\" Keel said. \"Did you know that there are more brown-eyed Mermen than blue-eyed by four to one? Doesn\u0027t that strike you as a mutation? You\u0027re blue-eyed. Should you, then, be sterilized or destroyed? We draw the line at mutations that actually endanger life. You prefer cosmetic genocide, it seems. Can you justify that to me? Can you be sure that we haven\u0027t \u0027bred\u0027 some secret weapons to meet the contingency you\u0027ve presented us?\"\n Find his worst fears, Keel thought, and turn them on himself.\n The clatter of loose dishes sounded from the hatchway and a small cart bounced over the threshold. The young man who pushed it stood in obvious awe of Gallow. His eyes took in every move his boss made and his hands shook as they distributed the dishes on a small folding table. He served the steaming food into bowls and Keel smelled the delicious tang of fish stew. When the steward finished laying out the bread and a small cake dessert he picked up a small dish of his own and spooned a taste of everything.\n So, Keel thought, Gallow\u0027s afraid he\u0027s going to be poisoned. He was glad to see the orderly delicately taste Keel\u0027s portions, as well. Things are not going quite as Gallow would like us to believe. Keel couldn\u0027t let the moment pass.\n \"Do you taste to educate your palate?\" he asked.\n The orderly shot a quizzical look at Gallow and Gallow smiled back. \"All men in power have enemies,\" he said. \"Even yourself, I\u0027m told. I choose to encourage protective habits.\"\n \"Protection from whom?\"\n Gallow was silent. The orderly\u0027s face paled.\n \"Very astute,\" Gallow said.\n \"By this you imply that murder is the current mode of political expression,\" Keel said. \"Is this the new leadership you offer our world?\"\n Gallow\u0027s palm slapped the tabletop and the orderly dropped his bowl. It shattered. One shard of it skidded up to Keel\u0027s foot and spun there like an eccentric top winding down. Gallow dismissed the orderly with a sharp chop of his hand. The hatch closed quietly behind him.\n Gallow threw down his spoon. It caught the edge of his bowl and splattered Keel with stew. Gallow dabbed at Keel\u0027s tunic with his cloth, leaning across the rickety table.\n \"My apologies, Mr. Justice,\" he said. \"I\u0027m generally not so boorish. You ... excite me. Please, relax.\"\n Keel nursed the ache in his knees and folded them under the short table.\n Gallow tore a piece of bread from the loaf and handed Keel the rest.\n \"You have Scudi Wang prisoner?\" Keel asked.\n \"Of course.\"\n \"And the young Islander, Norton?\"\n \"He\u0027s with her. They are unharmed.\"\n \"It won\u0027t work,\" Keel said. \"If you hinge your leadership on stealth and prisoners and murder then you set yourself up for a long reign of the same thing. No one wants to deal with a desperate man. Kings are made of better stuff.\"\n Gallow\u0027s ears pricked at the word \"king.\" Keel could see him trying it on his tongue.\n \"You\u0027re not eating, Mr. Justice.\"\n \"As I said before, I have a stomach problem.\"\n \"But you have to eat. How will you live?\"\n Keel smiled. \"I won\u0027t.\"\n Gallow set his spoon down carefully and dabbed at his lips with his cloth. He knit his smooth brow in an expression of concern.\n \"If you choose not to eat, you will be fed,\" Gallow warned. \"Spare yourself that unpleasantry. You won\u0027t starve yourself out of my care.\"\n \"Choice has nothing to do with it,\" Keel said. \"You snatched inferior merchandise. Eating causes pain, and the food merely passes undigested.\"\n Gallow pushed himself back from the squat table.\n \"It\u0027s not catching, Mr. Gallow.\"\n \"What is it?\"\n \"A defect,\" Keel said. \"Our bioengineers helped me up to this point, but now the Greater Committee takes matters out of our hands.\"\n \"The Greater Committee?\" Gallow asked. \"You mean that there is a group topside more powerful than yours? A secret clan?\"\n Keel laughed, and the laugh added frustration and confusion to Gallow\u0027s otherwise perfect face.\n \"The Greater Committee goes by many names,\" Keel said. \"They are a subversive bunch, indeed. Some call them Ship, some call them Jesus - not the Jesus Lewis of your school-day histories. This is a difficult committee to confront, as you can see. It makes the threat of death at your hands not much of a threat at all.\"\n \"You\u0027re ... dying?\"\n Keel nodded. \"No matter what you do,\" he said, smiling, \"the world will believe that you killed me.\"\n Gallow stared at Keel for a long blink, then blotted his lips with the napkin. He extricated himself from the table.\n \"In that case,\" Gallow announced, \"if you want to save those kids, you\u0027ll do exactly as I say.\"\n ... it comes to pass that the same evils and inconveniences take place in all ages of history.\n - Niccolo Machiavelli, Discourses, Shiprecords\n From his position at the foil\u0027s controls, Brett watched the late afternoon sun kindle a glow in the cloud bank ahead of him. The foil drove easily across deep storm swells, picking up speed on each downslope, losing a bit on each advancing wave. It was a rhythm that Brett had come to understand without conscious attention. His body and senses adjusted.\n A gray wall of rain skulked a couple of hundred meters above the wavetops to the right. A line storm, it appeared to be rolling away from them.\n Brett, his attention divided between the course monitor above him and the seas ahead, abruptly throttled back. The foil dropped off its step and moved with minimal headway beside a kelp bed that stretched away into the storm track.\n The change in motion aroused the others, who, except for Bushka and the captive Merman, whom Bushka had locked in the cargo bay with the survivors of the LTA, were sprawled around the cabin catching what rest they could. Bushka sat in regal isolation on the couch at the rear of the cabin, his eyes oddly indrawn, his face a mask of concentration as he stroked a fragment of kelp that lay across his lap. The bit of kelp had come up from the sea on Twisp\u0027s rescue line and had attracted little attention until Bushka plucked it off and kept it.\n Panille spoke from the copilot\u0027s seat as he came abruptly alert. \"Something wrong?\"\n Brett indicated the green glow of their position on the course monitor. \"We\u0027re only a couple of klicks out.\" He pointed at the line squall. \"The outpost is in there.\"\n Twisp spoke from behind them: \"Bushka, you still going through with this?\"\n \"I have no choice.\" Bushka\u0027s voice carried a distant tone. He stroked the fragment of kelp, which had begun to dry and crisp. It rasped under his hand.\n Twisp nodded at the net of weapons Bushka had taken from the LTA survivors. \"Then maybe we all better be armed.\"\n \"I\u0027m thinking on it,\" Bushka said. Again, his hand rasped across the drying kelp.\n \"Panille,\" Twisp said, \"how are outposts defended?\"\n Scudi, seated on the deck across from Twisp, answered for him. \"Outposts aren\u0027t expected to need defenses.\"\n \"They have the usual sonar, perimeter alarms against dashers, that sort of thing,\" Panille said. \"Each outpost has at least one LTA for weather observation.\"\n \"But what weapons?\" Twisp asked.\n \"Tools, mostly,\" Scudi said.\n Bushka nudged the netful of captured weapons at his feet. \"They will have lasguns. Gallow arms his people.\"\n \"But they\u0027d be effective only inside the outpost compound,\" Panille said. \"We\u0027re safe in the water.\"\n \"Which is why I stopped here,\" Brett said. \"Do you think they know we\u0027re here?\"\n \"They know,\" Bushka said. \"They just don\u0027t know who we are.\" He peeled the dried kelp from his dive suit and dropped it to the deck.\n Scudi stood and moved to Brett\u0027s side, resting an arm on the back of his seat. \"They will have welders, plasteel cutters, some stunshields, knives, pry-bars. Tools are very effective weapons.\" She looked at Bushka. \"As Guemes should have taught us.\"\n Panille swiveled and looked at the passage that led back to the cargo compartment. \"Some of those people back there might know some details about what we can expect down there -\"\n \"This is stupid!\" Brett said. \"What can we do against Gallow and all his men?\"\n \"We will wait for nightfall,\" Bushka said. \"Darkness is a great equalizer.\" He looked at Scudi. \"You say you\u0027ve worked at this outpost. You can draw up a plan of the access hatches, the power station, tool storage, vehicle bays ... that sort of thing.\"\n Scudi looked at Brett, who shrugged.\n Twisp glanced once at the lasgun in Bushka\u0027s hand, then at his face. \"You really mean for us to attack them, don\u0027t you?\"\n \"Of course.\"\n \"Unarmed?\"\n \"We will have the inestimable arm of surprise.\"\n Twisp let out a barking laugh.\n \"Let me talk to Kareen,\" Panille said. \"She can\u0027t be one of them. She may have learned -\"\n \"She\u0027s not to be trusted,\" Bushka said. \"She belonged to Ryan Wang when he was alive, and now she belongs to Gallow.\"\n \"No, she doesn\u0027t!\"\n \"Men are so easily manipulated by sex,\" Bushka sneered.\n Panille\u0027s dark face darkened further with anger, but he held his silence for a blink. Then: \"The kelp! The kelp can tell us what we need to know!\"\n \"Do not trust the kelp, either,\" Bushka said. \"Every sentient thing in this universe thinks of itself first. We don\u0027t know what the kelp fears or desires.\"\n Panille glanced at the bit of dried kelp on the deck. \"Scudi, what do you say about the kelp? You\u0027ve worked in and around it more than any of us.\"\n \"She is Ryan Wang\u0027s daughter!\" Bushka blared. \"You ask the enemy for advice?\"\n \"I ask where I might get an answer,\" Panille said. \"And if you\u0027re not going to use that lasgun, quit waving it around.\" He turned from a flabbergasted Bushka to Scudi. \"What\u0027s the kelp\u0027s range, from your experience?\"\n \"Worldwide,\" she said, \"and almost instantaneous.\"\n \"That fast?\"\n Scudi shrugged. \"And what it learns, it never forgets.\" She noted the look of surprise on Panille\u0027s face and went on. \"We\u0027ve made reports. Most supervisors don\u0027t go out there, so they write this off to narcosis and keep us out of deep water for a week.\"\n \"What else might help us?\"\n \"There are weak spots,\" Scudi said. \"Immature kelp is strictly a conductor. Mature kelp carries a presence all its own.\"\n \"What do you mean?\" Twisp asked.\n \"If I touch a young patch of kelp and you touch a mature one, we sense each other. But now ... it is doing something more. Bushka\u0027s right that it may do things on its own.\"\n \"It has learned to kill,\" Bushka said.\n Scudi said, \"I always thought it could transmit, but not translate.\"\n Bushka asked, \"How many people can the outpost support?\"\n Scudi juggled the question a moment. \"They have accommodations, food and other supplies for about three hundred. But they have open land at the center. They could shelter a lot more people.\"\n Brett turned to Bushka. \"Does Gallow have three hundred people?\"\n Bushka nodded. \"More.\"\n \"Then we can\u0027t confront them,\" Twisp said. \"This is crazy.\"\n \"I\u0027m going to kill Gallow,\" Bushka said.\n \"That\u0027s it?\" Twisp demanded. \"That\u0027s all? Then they\u0027ll quit and go home?\"\n Bushka would not meet Twisp\u0027s gaze. \"All right,\" he said with a flick of the weapon, \"let\u0027s see what Kareen Ale has to say. Put the foil on autopilot, Brett.\"\n \"Autopilot?\" Brett asked. \"Why?\"\n \"We\u0027re all going back to see Kareen,\" Bushka said. \"Everybody move easily, no sudden surprises.\"\n No one argued with those jumpy, glittering eyes. Brett and Scudi led the way through the hatch and down the passageway. At the cargo hatch Bushka motioned Twisp to the lock.\n \"Open the exterior hatch first,\" he ordered. \"We might want to throw something overboard.\"\n Slowly, reluctantly, Twisp obeyed. A fresh breeze tasting of iodine and salt ricocheted through the hatchway. Wave-slaps against the hull were loud in the passage.\n \"Open the cargo hatch and stand aside,\" Bushka said.\n Twisp lifted the security bar, released the latch and slid the hatch to one side.\n Without warning, Brett was knocked down by something wet and ropy coming from behind him. A large strand of kelp snaked past him, swerved left and slammed the LTA\u0027s survivors against the bulkhead. It held them there. The thumpings of the kelp turned the passageway into a great drum. Brett snatched a grab, caught his balance and saw the rapt features of Iz Bushka, who was held in loops of kelp.\n Bushka stood with both arms upraised, the lasgun still clutched in his right fist. Strands of kelp caressed his body, their leaves particularly drawn to his face and hands. More strands lay like ropes on the deck, fanned out on both sides. Scudi and the others were not in sight.\n A branch of kelp detached itself from the captives and undulated toward Brett. The fronded tip lifted and enclosed Brett\u0027s face.\n Brett heard whistling - the wind against the foil, but enhanced, every tonal component identifiable. He felt his senses amplified - the touch of the deck, other people around him ... many others ... thousands. He sensed Scudi then, as though the kelp gave her to him with her thoughts clear. Bushka was there, an enraptured Bushka drinking from the kelp\u0027s reservoir of memories. A historian\u0027s paradise: firsthand history.\n Scudi spoke in Brett\u0027s head: \"The rocket is up. They\u0027re on their way to get the hyb tanks.\"\n Brett saw it then, a fiery ascent that flamed through the cloud cover and became an orange glow on the gray until it vanished and only the clouds remained. With the vision went a questioning thought, a profound wonder that was not human. The rocket was a wondrous thing of anticipation in this thought. It was a seeking after great surprises.\n The thought and the vision vanished. Brett found himself sitting on the deck in the foil\u0027s passage and looking into the cargo bay. Bushka sat there sobbing. The bay behind him was empty. The kelp was gone.\n Brett heard others then and Scudi\u0027s voice came overloud. \"Brett! Are you all right?\"\n He scrambled to his feet, turning. Scudi stood there with movements of others behind her, but Brett could focus only on Scudi. \"As long as you\u0027re here, I\u0027m all right,\" he said.\n Symbols are worth a damn.\n - Duque Kurz\n 19(?) Alki, 468. Outpost 22.\n When they call me \"Mr. Justice\" I feel the scales of law and life freeze in my palm. I am not Ward Keel to them, the big-headed man with the long neck and stiff shuffle, but some god who will see the right thing and do it. And good will come. God and good, evil and devil - words are the symbols that flesh out our world. We expect that. We act on it.\n Resentment, that\u0027s expectation gone bad. I must admit, our crises are legion, but we live to confront our crises and that\u0027s something no god ever promised.\n Simone Rocksack thinks she knows what Ship has promised. That\u0027s her job, she says. She tells the faithful what Ship meant and they believe her. The Histories are there for the reading. I come to my own conclusions: We are neither rewarded nor punished. We are. My job as Chief Justice has been to keep as many of us being as possible.\n The Committee\u0027s foundations were in science and fear. Original questions were quite simple: kill it or care for it. Terminate if dangerous. That power over life and death in a time of much death lent an aura to the Committee that it should never have accepted. In lieu of law, there is the Committee.\n It is true that the C/P asserts the law of Ship and it is also true that her people enforce it. They give unto Ship that which is Ship\u0027s ... together we keep the human world flowing.\n \"Flow\" is the right word. We Islanders understand current and flow. We understand that conditions and times change. To change, then, is normal. The Committee reflects that flexibility. Most law is simply a matter of personal contracts, agreements. Courts deal with squabbles.\n The Committee deals with life and life alone. Somehow that has extended to politics, a matter of group survival. We are autonomous, elect our own replacements, and our word is as close to absolute law as Islanders get. They trust nothing fixed. Rigidity in law appalls them as much as cold statuary.\n Part of our enjoyment of art derives from its transitory nature. It is made constantly new and if it is to survive over time it does so in the theater of memory. We Islanders have great respect for the mind. It is a most interesting place, a tool at the base of all tools, torture chamber, haven of rest and repository of symbols. All that we have relies on symbol. With symbols we create more world than we were given, we become more than the sum of our parts.\n Anyone who threatens the mind or its symbolizing endangers the matrix of humanity itself. I have tried to explain as much to Gallow. He has the ears for it; he simply doesn\u0027t care.\n When power shifts, men shift with it.\n - George Orwell, Shiprecords\n The argument was over whether to arm Nakano. Bushka favored it and Twisp did not. Ale and Panille remained aloof, listening but not watching. They stood, each with an arm around the other\u0027s waist, looking out on the lowering gray sky visible through the open hatchway. The foil circled on autopilot in a wide pool of open water surrounded by kelp. The outpost lifted from the sea about ten klicks away - a foam-collared pillar of rock set in a ring of kelp. A kelp-free area surrounded the outpost. The rock appeared to be at least one klick away from this vantage.\n Brett found himself alarmed by the change in Bushka. What had the kelp done to Bushka there in the cargo bay? And where were the other captive Mermen? Only Ale, Panille and Nakano remained of those rescued from the LTA.\n Twisp voiced it for all of them: \"What did the kelp do to you, Iz?\"\n Bushka looked down at the net of weapons by his right foot. His gaze passed over the lasguns he had already distributed to the others - to everyone except Nakano. A look of childlike bewilderment swept over Bushka\u0027s face. \"It told me ... it told me ...\" He brightened. \"It told me we must kill Gallow and it showed me how.\" He turned and stared past Ale and Panille at the kelp drifting on the surging waves. A rapt expression came over his face.\n \"And you agreed, Nakano?\" Twisp demanded.\n \"It makes little difference,\" Nakano said, his voice gruff. \"The kelp wants him dead but he will not be dead.\"\n Twisp shuddered and looked at Scudi and Brett. \"That\u0027s not what it said to me. How about you, kid?\"\n \"It showed me the launching of the rocket.\"\n Brett closed his eyes. Scudi pressed herself against him, leaning her head into his shoulder. He knew the experience they had shared: thousands of people alive now only in the kelp\u0027s memories. The last agony of the Guemes Islanders was there and everything the dead had ever thought or dreamed. He had heard Scudi exclaiming in his mind: \"Now, I know what it feels like to be a Mute!\"\n Scudi pushed herself a bit away from Brett\u0027s embrace and looked at Twisp. \"The kelp said it\u0027s my friend because I\u0027m one of its teachers.\"\n \"What did it say to you, Twisp?\" Brett asked. Brett opened his eyes wide and stared hard at the long-armed fisherman.\n Twisp inhaled a deep, quick breath and spoke in a sharp voice: \"It just told me about myself.\"\n \"It told him he\u0027s a man who thinks for himself and likes to keep his thoughts private,\" Nakano said. \"It told me we\u0027re alike in this. Isn\u0027t that it, Twisp?\"\n \"More or less.\" Twisp sounded embarrassed.\n \"It said our kind\u0027s dangerous to leaders who demand blind obedience,\" Nakano said. \"The kelp respects this.\"\n \"There! You see?\" Bushka smiled at them, lifting a lasgun out of the pile of weapons he had taken from the people off the LTA. He balanced the lasgun on his open palm, staring at it.\n Panille turned from the hatchway and looked at Bushka. \"You all accept this?\" His voice was flat. He glared at Nakano. \"Only you and Kareen and I are left!\" He jerked his chin toward the hatchway. \"Where are the others?\"\n Silence settled over the group.\n Panille turned toward the perimeter of kelp visible in the darkening light. He remembered hurdling the glut of kelp and reaching for Kareen as a giant vine released her. She had grabbed him close and they had clung to each other while cries of fear lifted all around them.\n In that instant of kelp-awareness, he had been inundated by Kareen: Gallow\u0027s captive - sent with Nakano to be used as bait in the capture of Dark Panille. She had her loyalty problems, too. Her family, with all its power, wanted a hold on Gallow in case he was victorious. But Kareen loathed Gallow.\n Kareen\u0027s fingers had held a painful grip on Panille\u0027s water-frizzed hair while she cried against his neck. Then the kelp had returned ... and touched them once more. They had both felt the kelp\u0027s selective fury, sensed the leaves and vines writhing seaward ... bottomward. Presently, the hatchway had framed a churning gray sea, not a sign there to betray the fact that humans had been removed from the foil ... and drowned.\n But that was the past. Bushka cleared his throat, breaking Panille\u0027s reverie. \"They were Gallow\u0027s people,\" Bushka said. \"What does it matter?\"\n \"Nakano was one of Gallow\u0027s people,\" Twisp said.\n \"It\u0027s not an easy choice,\" Nakano said. \"Gallow saved my life once. But so did you, Twisp.\"\n \"So you go with whoever saved you most recently,\" Twisp said, scorn in his voice.\n Nakano spoke in a curious lilting tone: \"I go with the kelp. There is my immortality.\"\n Brett\u0027s throat went dry. He had heard that tone in Guemes fanatics, the hardest of the hard-core WorShipers.\n Twisp, obviously having a similar reaction, shook his head from side to side. Nakano did not care who he killed! The kelp justified everything!\n \"Gallow wants Vata,\" Bushka said. \"We can\u0027t allow that.\" He passed the lasgun to Nakano, who slipped it into its holster at his thigh.\n At Bushka\u0027s movement, Twisp put his hand on his own weapon. He did not relax even when Nakano displayed empty hands and smiled at him.\n \"Seven of us,\" Twisp said. \"And we\u0027re supposed to attack a place that could have more than three hundred armed people in it!\"\n Bushka closed the hatchway before looking at Twisp. \"The kelp told me how to kill Gallow,\" he said. \"Do you doubt the kelp?\"\n \"You\u0027re damned right I do!\"\n \"But we are going to do it,\" Bushka said. He pushed past Twisp and went up the passageway toward the pilot cabin. Brett took Scudi\u0027s hand and followed. He could hear the others coming after them, Twisp muttering: \"Stupid, stupid, stupid ...\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-lazarus-effect-destination-void-3/page-26.html","bookId":2171,"book":{"id":2171,"title":"The Lazarus Effect (Destination: Void #3)","description":"Storyline: \n The Lazarus Effect (Destination: Void #3) \n The Histories assert that a binary system cannot support life.
