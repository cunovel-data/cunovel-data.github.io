{"id":98920,"no":29,"title":"Page 29","content":"\"I\u0027m filled with joy that the Islands can produce such good men,\" Keel said. \"I am ready to be judged.\"\\n\\n Twisp wiped at his eyes, still bending close to hear the Chairman\u0027s last words. When Keel did not continue, Twisp became aware that there was no sound of breathing from the supine figure. Twisp put a hand to the artery at Keel\u0027s neck. No pulse. He straightened.\\n\\n What can I do?\\n\\n Was there anything combustible here to burn the old body and prevent the Mermen from consigning Keel to the sea? He looked all around the room. Nothing. Twisp stared helplessly at the body on the table.\\n\\n \"Is he dead?\" It was Nakano speaking from the hatchway.\\n\\n Twisp turned to find the big Merman standing just inside the room.\\n\\n The tears on Twisp\u0027s face were sufficient answer. \"He\u0027s not to be given to the kelp,\" Twisp said.\\n\\n \"Friend Twisp, he died but he need not be dead,\" Nakano said. \"You can meet him again in Avata.\"\\n\\n Twisp clenched his fists, his long arms trembling. \"No! He asked me to prevent that!\"\\n\\n \"But it\u0027s not up to us,\" Nakano said. \"If he was a deserving man, Avata will wish to accept him.\"\\n\\n Twisp jumped to the side of the table and stood with his back to it.\\n\\n \"Let me take him to Avata,\" Nakano said. He moved toward Twisp.\\n\\n As Nakano came within range of those long arms, Twisp shot out a net-calloused fist, leaning his shoulder behind it. The blow struck with blinding speed on the side of Nakano\u0027s jaw. Nakano\u0027s heavily muscled neck absorbed most of the shock but his eyes glazed. Before he could recover, Twisp leaped forward and wrenched one of Nakano\u0027s arms backward, intending to throw the man to the deck.\\n\\n Nakano recovered enough to tense his muscles and prevent this. He turned slowly against Twisp\u0027s pressure, moving like a great pillar of kelp.\\n\\n Abruptly, the guards swarmed into the room. Other hands grabbed Twisp and jerked him aside, pinning him to the deck.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t hurt him!\" Nakano shouted.\\n\\n The pressures on Twisp eased but did not leave.\\n\\n Nakano stood over Twisp, a sad look on the big face, a touch of blood at the corner of his mouth.\\n\\n \"Please, friend Twisp, I mean you no harm. I mean only to honor the Chief Justice and Chairman of the Committee on Vital Forms, a man who has served us so well for so long.\"\\n\\n One of the guards pinning Twisp down snickered.\\n\\n Immediately, Nakano grasped the man by a shoulder and lifted him like a sack of fishmeal, hurling him aside.\\n\\n \"These Islanders you sneer at are as dear to Avata as any of us!\" Nakano bellowed. \"Any among you who forgets this will answer to me!\"\\n\\n The abused guard stood with his back to a bulkhead, his face contorted with fear.\\n\\n Indicating Twisp with one thick finger, Nakano said: \"Hold him but let him up.\" Nakano went to the table and lifted Keel\u0027s body gently in his arms. He turned and strode past the guards, pausing at the hatchway. \"When I have gone, take the fisherman to our leader. GeLaar Gallow is topside and has things to say.\" Nakano looked thoughtfully at Twisp. \"He needs your help to get the hyb tanks - they\u0027re on their way down.\"\\n\\n Hybernation is to hibernation as death is to sleep. Closer to death than it is to life, hybernation can be lifted only by the grace of Ship.\\n\\n - the Histories\\n\\n While Brett held Bushka down, Ale tied off the stump of Bushka\u0027s left arm with a length of dive harness. Bushka lay just inside the main hatch, the sea surface visible through the plaz port behind him. Big Sun, just entering its afternoon quadrant, painted oily coils across the kelp fronds out there, now bright and now dulled as clouds scudded overhead.\\n\\n A moan escaped Bushka.\\n\\n The foil rolled gently in a low sea. Ale braced herself against a bulkhead while she worked.\\n\\n \"There,\" she said as she tied off the dive harness. Blood smeared the deck around them and their dive suits were red with it.\\n\\n Ale turned and shouted up the passage behind Brett. \"Shadow! Do you have that cot ready?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m bringing it!\"\\n\\n Brett took a deep breath and looked out the plaz at the quiescent kelp - so harmless-looking, so tranquil. The horizon was an absurd pinkish gray where Little Sun would soon lift into view, joining its giant companion.\\n\\n It had been a hellish half hour.\\n\\n Bushka, meandering aimlessly around the pilot cabin, had lulled them into a sense of security by his casual movements. Abruptly, he had dashed down the passageway and hit the manual override on the main hatch. Water had come blasting in at the high pressure of their depth - almost thirty-five meters down. Bushka had been prepared. Standing to one side of the blasting water, he had grabbed an emergency tank-breather outfit stored beside the hatch, slipping swiftly into the harness.\\n\\n Brett and Panille, running after him, had been spilled and tumbled in the wash of water boiling down the passage. Only Scudi\u0027s alertness in sealing off a section between them and the open hatch had saved the foil and its occupants.\\n\\n Bushka had kicked easily out into the kelp-jungle where the foil lay on bottom.\\n\\n Scudi, faced with tons of water in the foil, had blown tanks and started the pumps, shouting for Kareen to help Brett and Shadow. The foil had lifted slowly, floating upward through the massed kelp.\\n\\n Brett and Panille, splashing their way back into the cabin, had accepted a hand from Kareen. Scudi, seated at the controls, spared a glance for Brett to reassure herself that he was safe, then returned her attention to the watery world visible through the plaz.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s tearing him apart!\" Scudi gasped.\\n\\n The others sloshed to a position behind Scudi and looked outside. The foil slithered upward against giant kelp fronds, giving those inside the pilot cabin a dimly lighted view of Bushka close beside them. One large kelp tentacle, wrapped around his body, held Bushka fast while another tentacle gripped his left arm. A cloud of dark liquid flooded the water around Bushka\u0027s arm.\\n\\n Kareen gasped.\\n\\n Brett understood then - the cloud: blood! The arm had been torn from Bushka\u0027s body.\\n\\n As though it wanted to spit him out, the kelp tentacles whipped away from Bushka and shunted him swiftly upward.\\n\\n Scudi tipped the foil\u0027s nose up and drove for the surface. They found Bushka there, half-conscious and bleeding dangerously. A hunt of dashers, coming to the smell of blood, was whipped back by kelp fronds.\\n\\n Later, after Kareen had treated Bushka, Brett and Panille lashed him to the cot and carried him forward. Ale walked alongside. \"He\u0027s lost a lot of blood,\" she said. \"The brachial artery was wide open.\"\\n\\n Scudi remained at the helm, sparing only a brief glance at Bushka\u0027s pale face as the cot was lowered to the deck behind her. She held the foil in a tight circle within a kelp-free area. Choppy waves drummed a dulled tunk-tunk against the hull. The last of the unwanted water had gone overboard but the decks were still damp with it.\\n\\n Scudi, the image of Bushka\u0027s injuries fresh in her mind, thought: Ship save us! The kelp has turned vicious!\\n\\n Panille stood above Bushka. A wash of agony grayed Bushka\u0027s face but he appeared conscious. Seeing this, Panille demanded, \"What were you trying to do?\"\\n\\n \"Shhhh,\" Ale cautioned.\\n\\n \"\u0027S\u0027all right,\" Bushka managed. \"Was gonna kill Gallow.\"\\n\\n Panille could not suppress his outrage. \"You almost killed us all!\"\\n\\n Kareen pulled Panille away.\\n\\n Brett slid into the seat beside Scudi and looked out at the dark pile of the outpost with its foam-laced base. Little Sun had risen and the water was bright with the double light.\\n\\n \"Kelp,\" Bushka said.\\n\\n \"Hush,\" Ale said. \"Save your strength.\"\\n\\n \"Gotta talk. Kelp has all the Guemes dead ... in it. All there. Said I tore off arm of humanity ... punished me in kind. Damn! Damn!\" He tried to look at the place where his arm had been but the lashings on the cot restrained him.\\n\\n Scudi stared wide-eyed at Brett. Was it possible the kelp took on the personality of all the dead it had absorbed? Would all the old scores be settled? Given consciousness finally and words in which to express itself, the kelp spoke in violent action. She shuddered as she looked out at the green fronds surrounding the foil.\\n\\n \"There are dashers all over the place,\" Scudi said.\\n\\n \"Where ... where\u0027s my arm?\" Bushka moaned.\\n\\n His eyes were closed and his large head looked even larger against the pale fabric of the cot.\\n\\n \"Packed in ice in the cooler,\" Ale said. \"We\u0027ll interfere as little as possible with the wound tissue. Better chance for reattachment.\"\\n\\n \"Kelp knew I was just a fool that Gallow ... took advantage of,\" Bushka groaned. He twisted his head from side to side. \"Why\u0027d it hurt me?\"\\n\\n A heavy gust of wind popped the foil hard and thrust it sideways against the kelp. A loud thump sounded amidships and the foil heeled, righting itself with a rasping hiss.\\n\\n \"What is it? What\u0027s that?\" Ale demanded.\\n\\n Brett pointed to the sky above the outpost. \"I think we\u0027ve just had our attention called to something. Look! Have you ever seen that many LTAs?\"\\n\\n \"LTAs hell!\" Panille said. \"Ship\u0027s guts! Those are hylighters! Thousands of them.\"\\n\\n Brett stared open-mouthed. Like all Pandoran children, he had watched holos of the kelp\u0027s spore carriers, a phenomenon unseen on Pandora for generations. Panille was right! Hylighters!\\n\\n \"They\u0027re so beautiful,\" Scudi murmured.\\n\\n Brett had to agree. The hylighters, giant organic hydrogen bags, danced with rainbow colors in the doubled sunlight. They drifted high across the outpost, moving southwest on a steady wind.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s out of our hands now,\" Panille said. \"The kelp will do its own propagating.\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027re coming down,\" Brett said. \"Look. Some of them are trailing tentacles in the water.\\n\\n The flight of hylighters, well past the outpost now, moved in a gentle slope of wind toward the sea.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s almost as though they were being directed,\" Scudi said. \"See how they move together.\"\\n\\n Once more, something hard banged against the foil\u0027s hull. A channel opened beside them, spreading outward toward the place where the hylighters were coming down close above the water. Slowly at first, a current moved the foil into the new channel.\\n\\n \"Better go along with it,\" Panille said.\\n\\n \"But Twisp is still there at the outpost!\" Brett objected.\\n\\n \"Kelp\u0027s directing this show,\" Panille said. \"Your friend will have to take his own chances.\"\\n\\n \"I think Shadow\u0027s right,\" Scudi ventured. She pointed toward the outpost. \"See? There are more hylighters. They\u0027re almost touching the rock.\"\\n\\n \"But what if Twisp comes back and we aren\u0027t ...\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll bring us back as soon as the kelp lets us,\" Scudi said. She fired up the ramjets.\\n\\n \"No! I\u0027ll take breather tanks and go out to -\"\\n\\n \"Brett!\" Scudi put a hand on his arm. \"You saw what it did to Bushka.\"\\n\\n \"But I haven\u0027t hurt it ... or anyone. That Merman would have killed me.\"\\n\\n \"We don\u0027t know what it\u0027ll do,\" Scudi said.\\n\\n \"She\u0027s right,\" Panille said. \"What good would you be to your friend without arms?\"\\n\\n Brett sank back into the seat.\\n\\n Scudi pushed the throttles ahead and lowered the foils. The boat gathered speed, lifted and swept down the channel toward the descending hylighters.\\n\\n Brett sat in silence. He felt suddenly that his Mermen companions had turned against him, even Scudi. How could they know what the kelp wanted? So it opened a channel through its heavy growth! So it directed a current through that channel! Twisp might need him back there where they were supposed to be waiting.\\n\\n Abruptly, Brett shook his head. He thought how Twisp would react to such protests. Don\u0027t be a fool! The kelp had spoken without misunderstanding. Bushka ... the channel ... the current - words could say no clearer what had to be done now. Scudi and the others had merely understood and accepted it more quickly.\\n\\n With a quick chopping motion, Scudi cut the power and the foil settled in a heaving surge that sent waves curling outward on both sides.\\n\\n \"We\u0027re blocked,\" she said.\\n\\n They looked ahead. Not only had kelp closed the channel through which the foil had come, but fronds and stalks lifted out of the water ahead of them. A low, thick forest of green blocked their passage.\\n\\n Brett glanced left. The outpost loomed high there, no more than three klicks away. Hylighters continued to descend about a klick ahead of them, massed flocks of them.\\n\\n Panille spoke from directly behind Brett. \"I don\u0027t remember them as being that colorful in the holos.\"\\n\\n \"A new breed, no doubt of it,\" Kareen said.\\n\\n \"What do we do now?\" Brett asked.\\n\\n \"We sit here until we find out why the kelp directed us to this place,\" Scudi said.\\n\\n Brett looked up at the descending flocks of hylighters. Dark tentacles reached down toward the water. Sunlight flashed rainbow iridescence off the great bags.\\n\\n \"The histories say the kelp makes its own hydrogen the way you Islanders do,\" Panille said. \"The bags are extruded deep underwater, filled and sent flying to spread the spores. One of my ancestors rode a hylighter.\" He spoke in a breathless whisper. \"They\u0027ve always fascinated me. I\u0027ve dreamed of this day.\"\\n\\n \"What are they doing?\" Scudi asked. \"Why would they bring spores here? There\u0027s kelp all around us.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re assuming they\u0027re intelligently directed,\" Kareen said. \"They\u0027re probably going wherever the wind takes them.\"\\n\\n Panille shook his head sharply. \"No. Who controls the currents controls the temperature of the surface water. Who controls that directs the winds.\"\\n\\n \"Then what are they doing?\" Scudi repeated. \"They\u0027re not drifting very fast anymore. It\u0027s as though they were assembling here.\"\\n\\n \"The hyb tanks?\" Kareen asked.\\n\\n \"How could the kelp -\" Scudi began. She broke off, then: \"Is this where they\u0027re supposed to come down?\"\\n\\n \"Near enough,\" Kareen said. \"Shadow?\"\\n\\n \"The correct quadrant,\" he said. He glanced at a chrono. \"By the original schedule, splashdown\u0027s already overdue.\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s a strange hylighter,\" Brett said. \"Or is that really an LTA?\" He pointed upward, his finger almost touching the overhead plaz.\\n\\n \"Parachute!\" Panille said. \"Ship\u0027s guts! There comes the first hyb tank!\"\\n\\n \"Look at the hylighters!\" Scudi said.\\n\\n The colorful bags had begun a swirling motion, opening a space in their center. The open space drifted somewhat south and a bit west, presenting a net of sea to catch the descending parachute.\\n\\n Something could be seen dangling from the parachute now - a silvery cylinder that reflected bright flashes from the suns.\\n\\n \"Ship! That thing is big!\" Panille said.\\n\\n \"I wonder what\u0027s in it,\" Kareen whispered.\\n\\n \"We\u0027re about to discover that,\" Brett said. \"Look! Above the parachute - there comes another one ... and another.\"\\n\\n \"Ohhhh, if I could only get my hands on one of them ... just one,\" Panille said.\\n\\n The first hyb tank was now little more than a hundred meters above the water. It descended swiftly, the actual splashdown concealed within the ring of hylighters. A second hyb tank fell into the open circle, a third ... fourth ... The watchers counted twenty of them, some larger than the foil.\\n\\n The circle of hylighters closed in as the last tank hit the water. Immediately, a lane through the kelp began to spread from the foil\u0027s blocked position to where the hylighters had collected.\\n\\n \"We\u0027re being asked to join them,\" Scudi said. She fired up the rams and eased the foil ahead at hull speed, keeping it just off the step. A bow wave spread on both sides. The hylighters parted as the foil drew near them, opening a passage into a kelp-free circle where the great tanks bobbed.\\n\\n The occupants of the foil stared in wonder at the vista opened to them. Hylighter tentacles could be seen working over the closure mechanisms of the tanks, opening them and snaking inside. Wide curved hatches swung aside to the probing tentacles. Abruptly, one of the opened tanks tipped, admitting a surge of water. White-bellied sea mammals emerged and immediately dove into the water.\\n\\n \"Orcas,\" Panille breathed. \"Look!\" He pointed across Brett\u0027s shoulder. \"Humpback whales! Just the way they looked in the holos.\"\\n\\n \"My whales,\" Scudi whispered.\\n\\n The channel that had been opened for the foil curved left now, directing them to a cluster of six tanks being held side by side in a nest of kelp. Hylighter tentacles could be seen writhing and twisting into the tanks.\\n\\n As the foil neared this cluster, a dark tentacle emerged with a struggling human form - pale-skinned and naked. Another tentacle came up with another human ... another ... another ... A spectrum of skin shades came out of the tanks - from darker than Scudi to paler than Kareen Ale.\\n\\n \"What are they doing with those poor people?\" Kareen demanded.\\n\\n The faces of the people being taken from the tanks betrayed obvious terror, but the terror began to subside even as the foil\u0027s occupants watched. Slowly, hylighters carrying humans began to drift toward the foil.\\n\\n \"There\u0027s why we were brought in,\" Brett said. \"Come on, Shadow. Let\u0027s open the hatch.\"\\n\\n Scudi silenced the foil\u0027s jets. \"We can\u0027t handle that many people,\" she said. She pointed at the massed hylighters removing other humans from the adjacent tanks. More than a hundred human figures could be seen grasped in hylighter tentacles and more humans were being removed from the tanks every second. \"That many will sink us!\" Scudi said.\\n\\n Brett, hesitating in the passageway to follow the direction of Scudi\u0027s pointing finger, said: \"We\u0027ll have to tow them to the outpost. We\u0027ll see if we can get a line to them.\" He whirled and dashed down the passage toward the main hatch. Panille could be heard running behind him.\\n\\n Hylighters already were clustering around the hatchway when Brett opened it. A tentacle snaked in the opening and grasped Brett. He froze. Words filled his mind, clear and perfect, without any secondary sounds to distort them.\\n\\n \"Gentle human who is loved by Avata\u0027s beloved Scudi, do not fear. We bring you Shipclones to live in peace beside all of you who share Pandora with Avata.\"\\n\\n Brett gasped and sensed Panille beside him: muddy thoughts - nowhere near as clear as those bell-like words entering his senses through the hylighter tentacles. Panille projected awe, schoolboy memories of holoviews displaying hylighters, family stories of that first Pandoran Panille ... then fear that the mass of humans being delivered by the hylighters would sink the foil.\\n\\n \"Hylighters will buoy you,\" the tentacles transmitted. \"Do not fear. What a splendid day this is! What marvelous surprises have come to us, the gift of blessed Ship.\"\\n\\n Slowly, Brett regained the use of his own senses. He found himself braced against loops of hylighter tentacles. Naked humans were being slipped through the hatchway one after another. How tall the newcomers were! Some of them had to duck in the passageway.\\n\\n Panille looked dazed in a similar tentacle grasp. He waved the newcomers up the passage toward the control cabin.\\n\\n \"Some of you can go into the cargo bays along this passage,\" Brett called.\\n\\n They went where Brett and Panille directed them ... no questions, no arguments. They appeared to be in shock from awakening into the tentacles of hylighters.\\n\\n \"We\u0027re being moved toward the outpost,\" Panille said. He nodded toward the edge of black rock visible out the hatchway. The sound of the surf against the base of the outpost was clearly audible.\\n\\n \"Gallow!\" Brett said.\\n\\n As Brett spoke, the hylighter tentacles unwound from his body. Panille, too, was released. The space around them remained crowded with silent newcomers. More could be seen held in hylighter tentacles, other tentacles clutching the lip of the hatchway. Slowly, he began squeezing his way forward, apologizing, feeling the pressure of naked skin that made way for him.\\n\\n The pilot cabin was not quite as crowded as the passage. Space had been left around the unconscious form of Bushka on the cot. More space insulated the command seats where Scudi and Kareen sat. A lacework of hylighter tentacles covered most of the plaz, leaving only small framed bits of the forward view. The outpost loomed high there, the surf sound loud.\\n\\n \"Kelp is right up against the outpost now,\" Kareen said. \"Look at it! There\u0027s almost no open space left.\"\\n\\n One of the newcomers, a man so tall that his head almost touched the top of the cabin, came forward and bent to peer through a small opening in the lacework of hylighter tentacles. He straightened presently and looked down at the webs between Scudi\u0027s toes, then to the similar growth on Kareen\u0027s feet. He brought his attention at last to Brett\u0027s large eyes.\\n\\n \"God save us!\" he said. \"If we breed on this planet will our offspring all be deformed?\"\\n\\n Brett was caught first by the man\u0027s accent, an odd lilting in the way he spoke, then by the words. The man looked at Mermen and Islanders with the same obviously revolted expression.\\n\\n Kareen, shocked, shot a glance at Brett and then at the cabin full of giant humans, the looks of dazed withdrawal slowly vanishing from all of those faces - those strangely similar faces. Kareen wondered how these people could identify each other ... except for the variations in skin tone. They all looked so much alike!\\n\\n It dawned on her then that she was seeing Ship-normals ... human-normals. She, with her small stature and partly webbed toes, she was the freak.\\n\\n Ship! How would these newcomers take to people like the Chief Justice or even Queets Twisp with his ungainly arms? What would they say on encountering the C/P?\\n\\n The foil grated against rock then ... again ... again. It lifted slightly and was set down hard on a solid surface.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ve arrived,\" Scudi said.\\n\\n \"And we\u0027re going to have to deal with GeLaar Gallow somehow,\" Panille said.\\n\\n \"If the kelp hasn\u0027t already done it for us,\" Kareen said.\\n\\n \"There\u0027s no telling what it\u0027ll do,\" Panille said. \"I\u0027m afraid Twisp was right. It\u0027s not to be trusted.\"\\n\\n \"It can be damned convincing, though,\" Brett said, recalling the touch of hylighters at the hatchway.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s its real danger,\" Panille said.\\n\\n Fools! who slaughtered the cattle sacred to the sun-king; behold, the god deprived them of their day of homecoming.\\n\\n - Homer, Shiprecords\\n\\n Twisp could hear Gallow\u0027s people talking down in the basin, a nervousness in their chatter that told him the strength of his own position. Gallow had brought him up a narrow trail cut in the rock and out onto a flat promontory that jutted seaward on the southeastern edge of the outpost. A breeze blew against Twisp\u0027s face.\\n\\n \"One day, I will have my administrative building here,\" he said, gesturing expansively.\\n\\n Twisp glanced around him at the black rock sparkling with mineral fragments in the light of both suns. He had seen many days such as this one - both suns up, the sea rolling easily under a blanket of kelp - but never from such a vantage. Not even the highest point on Vashon commanded such a view - high, solid and unmoving.\\n\\n Gallow would build here? \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-lazarus-effect-destination-void-3/page-29.html","bookId":2171,"book":{"id":2171,"title":"The Lazarus Effect (Destination: Void #3)","description":"Storyline: The Lazarus Effect (Destination: Void #3) \\n The Histories assert that a binary system cannot support life.
