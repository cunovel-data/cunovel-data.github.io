{"id":98906,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"\"Yes,\" he said. \"One way or another, we all came from there.\"\n Ward Keel, standing in the shadows of the open passage from Ryan Wang\u0027s den, had been listening to this exchange for several minutes. He shuddered, wondering whether he should interrupt and demand some answers of this young woman. The anguish in her voice held Keel in place.\n \"Did those Islanders in the Nest work for your father?\" Keel asked.\n She didn\u0027t turn away from Brett to answer. \"Some of them. But no Islander has any high position on anything. They are controlled by a government agency. I think Ambassador Ale is in charge of it.\"\n \"It seems to me that an Islander should head an agency that deals with Islanders,\" Brett said.\n \"She and my father were to be married,\" Scudi said. \"A political matter between the two families ... a lot of Merman history that isn\u0027t important now.\"\n \"Your father and the ambassador - that would have linked the powers of the government and the food supply under one blanket,\" Brett said. The insight came so quickly that it startled him.\n \"That\u0027s all ancient history,\" Scudi said. \"She\u0027ll probably marry GeLaar Gallow now.\" Her words came out with an underlying misery that held Brett speechless. He could see the dark confusion in her eyes, the frustration of being a piece in some unruled game.\n In the shadows of the passage, Ward Keel nodded to himself. He had shuffled back from Wang\u0027s den with a feeling of helpless anger. It was all there for the discerning eye - the shifts of control, the quiet and remorseless accumulation of power in a few hands, an increase in local identity. A term from the Histories kept rattling in his memory: Nationalization. Why did it give him such a feeling of loss?\n The land is being restored.\n The good life is coming.\n This is why Ship gave Pandora to us.\n To us - to Mermen - not to Islanders.\n Keel\u0027s throat pained him when he tried to swallow. The kelp project lay at the base of it all, and that had gone too far to be lost or slowed. It was being taken over, instead. Justifications for the project could not be denied. The late Ryan Wang\u0027s comconsole was full of those justifications: Without the kelp the suns would continue to fatigue the crust of Pandora, constant earthquakes and volcanics would ravage them as they had all those generations back.\n Lava built up undersea plateaus along fault lines. Mermen were taking advantage of this for their project. The last wave-wall had been a consequence of a volcanic upheaval, not the gravitational swings that inflicted themselves on Pandora\u0027s seas.\n Brett was speaking: \"I would like to see the Nest and the Islanders there. Maybe that\u0027s where we should go.\"\n Out of the mouths of babes, Keel thought.\n Scudi shook her head in negation. \"They would find us there easily. Security there is not like here - there are badges, papers ...\"\n \"Then we should run topside,\" Brett said. \"The Justice is right. He wants us to tell the Islanders what\u0027s happening down here.\"\n \"And what is happening?\" she asked.\n Keel stepped out of the shadows, speaking as he moved: \"Pandora is being changed - physically, politically, socially. That\u0027s what\u0027s happening. The old life will not be possible, topside or down under. I think Scudi\u0027s father had a dream of great things, the transformation of Pandora, but someone else has taken it over and is making it a nightmare.\"\n Keel stopped, facing the two young people. They stared back at him, aghast.\n Can they feel it? Keel wondered.\n Runaway greed was working to seize control of this new Pandora.\n Scudi jabbed a finger at the schematic, which Brett still held. \"The Launch Base and Outpost Twenty-two,\" she said. \"Here! They are near Vashon\u0027s current drift. The Island will be at least a full day past this point by now but ...\"\n \"What\u0027re you suggesting?\" Keel asked.\n \"I think I can get us to Outpost Twenty-two,\" she said. \"I\u0027ve worked there. From the outpost, I could compute Vashon\u0027s exact position.\"\n Keel looked at the chart in Brett\u0027s hands. A surge of homesickness surged through the Justice. To be in his own quarters ... Joy near at hand to care for him. He was going to die soon ... how much better to die in familiar surroundings. As quickly as it came, the feeling was suppressed. Escape? He did not have the energy, the swiftness. He could only hold these young people back. But he saw the eagerness in Scudi and the way Brett picked up on it. They might just do it. The Islands had to be told what was happening.\n \"Here is what we will do,\" Keel said. \"And this is the message you will carry.\"\n Perseverance furthers.\n - I Ching, Shiprecords\n A flock of wild squawks came flying past the coracles, their wings whistling in the dull gray light of morning. Twisp turned his head to follow the birds\u0027 path. They landed about fifty meters ahead of him.\n Bushka had sat up at the sudden sound, fear obvious in his face.\n \"Just squawks,\" Twisp said.\n \"Oh.\" Bushka subsided with his back against the cuddy.\n \"If we feed \u0027em, they\u0027ll follow us,\" Twisp said. \"I\u0027ve never seen \u0027em this far from an Island.\"\n \"We\u0027re near the base,\" Bushka said.\n As they approached the swimming flock, Twisp tipped some of his garbage over the side. The birds came scrambling for the handout. The smaller ones churned their legs so fast they skipped across the water.\n It was the birds\u0027 eyes that interested him, he decided. There was living presence in those eyes you never saw in the eyes of sea creatures. Squawk eyes looked back at you with something of the human world in them.\n Bushka moved up and sat on the cuddy top to watch the birds and the horizon ahead of them. Where is that damned Launch Base? The motions of the birds kept attracting his attention. Twisp had said the squawks acted out of an ancient instinct. Probably true. Instinct! How long did it take to extinguish instinct? Or develop it? Which way were humans going? How strongly were they driven by such inner forces? Historian questions thronged his mind.\n \"That dull-looking squawk is a female,\" Bushka said, pointing to the wild flock. \"I wonder why the males are so much more colorful?\"\n \"Has to be some survival in it,\" Twisp said. He looked at the flock swimming beside the coracle, their eyes alert for another handout. \"That\u0027s a female, all right.\" A scowl settled over his face. \"One thing you can say for that hen squawk: she\u0027ll never ask a surgeon to make her normal!\"\n Bushka heard the bitterness and sensed the old familiar Islander story. It was getting to be ever more common these days: A lover had surgery to appear Merman-normal, then pressured the partner to do the same. A lot of angry fights resulted.\n \"Sounds like you got burned,\" Bushka said.\n \"I was crisped and charred,\" Twisp said. \"Have to admit it was fun at first ...\" He hesitated, then: \"... but I hoped it would be more than fun, something more permanent.\" He shook his head.\n Bushka yawned and stretched. The wild flock took his movement as a threat and scattered in a flurry of splashes and loud cries.\n Twisp stared toward the wild birds, but his eyes were not focused on them. \"Her name\u0027s Rebeccah,\" he said. \"She really liked my arms around her. Never complained about how long they were until -\" He broke off in sudden embarrassment.\n \"She chose surgical correction?\" Bushka prompted.\n \"Yeah.\" Twisp swallowed. Now what set me talking about Rebeccah to this stranger? Am I that lonesome? She had liked to feed the squawks at rimside every evening. He had enjoyed those evenings more than he could tell, and remembered details in a flood that he shut off as soon as it started.\n Bushka was staring at his own hands. \"She dumped you after the surgery?\"\n \"Dumped me? Naw.\" Twisp sighed. \"That would\u0027ve been easy. I know I\u0027d always feel like some kind of freak around her afterwards. No Mute can afford to feel that way, ever. It\u0027s why a lot of us more obvious types shy away from the Mermen. It\u0027s the stares and the way we think of ourselves then - our own eyes looking back from the mirror.\"\n \"Where is she now?\" Bushka asked.\n \"Vashon,\" Twisp said. \"Someplace close to Center, I\u0027d guess. That\u0027s one thing good looks can get you on Vashon. I\u0027d bet big money she\u0027s down there where the rich and powerful live. Her job was preparing people psychologically for surgical correction - she was sort of a living model of how life would be if they went through everything right.\"\n \"She made the choice, and it worked for her.\"\n \"If you talk about something like that long enough it becomes an obsession. She used to say: \u0027Changing some bodies is easy. A good surgeon knows just where to work. Minds are a little tougher.\u0027 I think she didn\u0027t really listen to herself.\"\n Bushka looked at Twisp\u0027s long arms, a sudden insight flooding his mind.\n Twisp saw the direction of Bushka\u0027s gaze and nodded. \"That\u0027s right,\" he said. \"She wanted me to get my arms fixed. She didn\u0027t understand, not even with all of her psychological crap behind her. I wasn\u0027t afraid of the knife or any of that eelshit. It was that my body would be a lie, and I can\u0027t stand liars.\"\n This is no ordinary fisherman, Bushka thought.\n \"I finally figured it out about her,\" Twisp said. \"A little too much boo and she started with this pitch for all of us to be \u0027as normal as possible.\u0027 Like you, Bushka.\"\n \"I don\u0027t feel that way.\"\n \"\u0027Cause you don\u0027t have to. You\u0027re all ready to join the Mermen on their open land, on their terms.\"\n Bushka found no words to answer. He had always been proud of his Merman-normal appearance. He could pass without surgery.\n Twisp pounded his fist against the rim of the coracle. It startled the caged squawks, who sat up and fluffed their feathers in frustration.\n \"She wanted kids ... with me,\" Twisp said. \"Can you imagine that? Think of the surprises you\u0027d find in the nursery when all these corrected, lying Mutes started bedding each other. And what about the kids growing up to find out that they\u0027re Mutes while their parents appear to be norms? Not for me!\" His voice was husky. \"No way.\"\n Twisp fell silent, lost in his own memories.\n Bushka listened to the slep-slep of waves against the coracle\u0027s sides, the faint rustling of the squawks preening and stretching in their cage. He wondered how many love affairs drowned on Twisp\u0027s style of principles.\n \"Damn that Jesus Lewis!\" Twisp muttered.\n Bushka nodded to himself. Yes, that was where the problem had started. Or, at least, where it was precipitated. The question remained for the historian: What made Jesus Lewis? Bushka looked at Twisp\u0027s arms - muscular, well-developed, tan and over half a length too long. The Island mating pool was still a genetic lottery, thanks to Jesus Lewis and his bioengineering experiments.\n Twisp was still angry. \"Mermen will never understand what growing up an Islander is like! Someone around you is always frail or dying ... someone close. My little sister was such a nice kid ...\" Twisp shook his head.\n \"We don\u0027t say \u0027mutation\u0027 much except when we\u0027re being technical,\" Bushka prompted. \"And deformity is a dirty word. \u0027Mistakes,\u0027 that\u0027s what we call them.\"\n \"You know what, Bushka? I deliberately avoid people with long arms. There are only a few of us in this generation.\" He raised his arm. \"Are these a mistake? Does that make me a mistake?\"\n Bushka didn\u0027t answer.\n \"Damn!\" Twisp said. \"My apprentice, Brett, he\u0027s sensitive about the size of his eyes. Shit, you can\u0027t tell anything just by looking at him, but you can\u0027t tell him that. Ship! Can he ever see in the dark! Is that a mistake?\"\n \"It\u0027s a lottery,\" Bushka said.\n Twisp grimaced. \"I don\u0027t envy the Committee\u0027s job. You have any idea of the grotesques and the dangerous forms they have to judge? How can they do it? And how can they guess at the mental mistakes? Those don\u0027t usually show up until later.\"\n \"But we have good times, too,\" Bushka protested. \"Mermen think our cloth is the best. You know the price we get for Islander weaving down under. And our music, our painting ... all of our art.\"\n \"Sure,\" Twisp sneered. \"I\u0027ve heard Mermen pawing over our stuff. \u0027How bright! Such fun. Oh! Isn\u0027t this pretty? Islanders are so full of fun.\u0027\"\n \"We are,\" Bushka muttered.\n Twisp merely looked at him for a long time. Bushka wondered if he had committed some unforgivable blunder.\n Suddenly, Twisp smiled. \"You\u0027re right. Damn! No Merman knows how to have a good time the way we do. It\u0027s either grief and despair or dancing and singing all night because somebody got married, or born, or got a new set of drums, or hauled in a big catch. Mermen don\u0027t celebrate much, I hear. You ever see Mermen celebrating?\"\n \"Never,\" Bushka admitted. And he remembered Nakano of Gallow\u0027s crew talking about Merman life.\n \"Work, get a mate, have a couple of kids, work some more and die,\" Nakano had said. \"Fun is a coffee break or hauling a sledge to some new outpost.\"\n Was that why Nakano had joined Gallow\u0027s movement? Precious little fun or excitement down under. Rescue an Islander. Work at building a barrier. Bushka did not think of life down under as grim for people like Nakano. Just drab. They hadn\u0027t the lure of an intellectual goal, nor even the nearness of grief to make them snatch at joy. But topside, there you found dazzle and color and a great deal of laughter.\n \"If we go back to the open land, it\u0027ll be different,\" Bushka said.\n \"What do you mean, \u0027if\u0027? Just a few minutes ago you were saying it was inevitable.\"\n \"There are Mermen who want only an undersea empire. If they -\"\n Bushka broke off as Twisp suddenly pointed ahead and blurted, \"Ship\u0027s balls! What is that?\"\n Bushka turned and saw, almost directly ahead of them, a gray tower with a lace of white surf at its base. It was like a thick stem to the great flower of sky, a blue flower edged in pink. The storm that had been skirting them for the past few hours framed the scene in a halo of black cloud. The tower, almost the same drab shade as the clouds, climbed up like a great fist out of the depths.\n Twisp stared in awe. It wasn\u0027t visible for fifty klicks, as Bushka had first stated, but it was impressive. Ship! He\u0027d not expected it to be so big.\n Beyond the gray press of sea and sky, the clouds began to open. The interrupted horizon became two bright flowers and neither man could take his gaze off the launch tower. It was the center of a giant stormcloud whirlpool.\n \"That\u0027s the Launch Base,\" Bushka said. \"That\u0027s the heart of the Merman space program. Every political faction they have will be represented there.\"\n \"You\u0027d never mistake it for something floating on the surface,\" Twisp said. \"No movement at all.\"\n \"It clears high water by twenty-five meters,\" Bushka said. \"Mermen brag about it. They\u0027ve only sent up unmanned shots. But things are moving fast. That\u0027s why Gallow and his people are acting now. The Mermen expect a manned shot into space soon.\"\n \"And they control the currents with the kelp?\" Twisp asked. \"How?\"\n \"I don\u0027t really know. I\u0027ve seen where they do it but I don\u0027t understand it.\"\n Twisp looked from the tower to Bushka and back to the tower. The foaming collar of surf around its base had expanded as the coracles drew closer, opening up a wider view. Twisp estimated their distance from the base at more than five kilometers, and even from that distance he saw that the surf reached left and right of the tower for several hundred meters on either side. More human activity could be seen there. One of the big Merman foils stood off in the calmer water beyond the surf with smaller craft shuttling back and forth to the tower. A Lighter-Than-Air hovered nearby, either for observation or use as a sky-crane. The coracles were close enough now to make out Mermen on the breakwater that fanned out from the base near the tower.\n The hydrofoil with its hydrogen ramjets sticking out like big egg sacks astern drew Twisp\u0027s attention. He had seen them only at a distance and in holos before this. The thing was at least fifty meters long, riding there easily on its flotation hull with the planing foils hidden underwater. A wide hatch stood open in its side with much Merman activity around the opening - bulky objects being lowered on an extruded crane.\n Bushka sat with one arm resting on the cuddy top, his other arm hanging loosely at his side. His head was turned away from Twisp, attention fixed on the Launch Base and its commanding tower. There was no sign yet that the Mermen had taken notice of the approaching coracles, but Twisp knew they had been seen and their course plotted. Bushka\u0027s reason for bringing them to this particular place seemed clear, if you believed his story about Gallow. There was little chance that Gallow\u0027s people would be the only ones at this base. And there would be Merman attention on every detail of this operation. All factions would hear Bushka\u0027s story. Would they believe it?\n \"Have you thought about how they\u0027re going to receive you and your story?\" Twisp asked.\n \"I don\u0027t think my chances are very good no matter where I turn up,\" Bushka answered. \"But better here than anywhere else.\" He brought his gaze around to meet Twisp\u0027s questioning stare. \"I think I\u0027m a dead man any way you look at it. But people have got to know.\"\n \"Very commendable,\" Twisp said. He cut the motor and pulled the tiller into his stomach, holding it there until the two boats circled slowly around each other. Time to apprise Bushka of the facts as Twisp saw them after a night\u0027s reflection.\n \"What\u0027re you doing?\" Bushka demanded.\n Twisp stretched both arms across the tiller and stared at Bushka. \"I came out here to find my apprentice. Kinda stupid of me, I know. I tell you true I didn\u0027t believe there was such a thing as that base, but I thought there would be something, and I came with you because what you said about help from the Mermen made sense.\"\n \"Of course it does! Somebody probably picked him up already and -\"\n \"But you\u0027re in trouble, Bushka. Deep shit. And I\u0027m in it, too, just by being with you. I wouldn\u0027t feel right about just dumping you or handing you over to them.\" He nodded toward the tower. \"Especially if your story about this Gallow happens to be true.\"\n \"If?\"\n \"Where\u0027s the proof?\"\n Bushka tried to swallow. Mermen already would be bringing in the Guemes dead and the survivors. He knew this. There was no turning back. Someone at the Launch Base already had these coracles and their occupants on a screen. Somebody would be sent to investigate or to warn them off.\n \"What do I do?\" Bushka asked.\n \"You sank a whole fucking island,\" Twisp growled. \"And you\u0027re just now asking yourself that?\"\n Bushka merely lifted his shoulders and let them fall in a futile shrug.\n \"Guemes must\u0027ve had small boats out, some in sight of the Island,\" Twisp said. \"There\u0027ll be survivors and they\u0027ll have their story to tell. Some of them may have seen your sub. You any idea what they\u0027ll be reporting?\"\n Bushka cringed under the weight of accusation in Twisp\u0027s voice.\n \"You were the pilot,\" Twisp said. \"They\u0027ll put you through more than this. You did it and they\u0027ll get every detail out of you before you talk to anybody outside of Merman Security. If you ever get outside their Security.\"\n Bushka lowered his chin to his knees. He felt that he might vomit. With a terrible sense of wonder, he heard coming from his own mouth a groan that pulsed in a rising pitch: nnnnnh nnnnnnh nnnnnnh.\n There\u0027s nowhere I can run, Bushka thought. Nowhere, nowhere.\n Twisp was still speaking to him but Bushka, lost in his own misery, no longer understood the words. Words could not reach into this place where his consciousness lay. Words were ghosts, things that would haunt him. He no longer felt that he could tolerate such haunting.\n The thrum of the coracle\u0027s little motor being switched on brought Bushka\u0027s attention back from its hiding place. He did not dare look up to see where Twisp might be taking them. All of the wheres were bad. It was just a matter of time until someone somewhere killed him. His mind floated on a sea while his muscles pulled him into a tighter and tighter ball so that he might fit into that sea without touching anything there. Voices cried to him, high-pitched screeches. His mind exposed glimpses of a universe fouled by carnage - the shredded Island and its broken shards of flesh. Dry heaves shook his body. He sensed movement in the coracle, but only vaguely. Something inside of him had to come out. Hands touched his shoulders and lifted him, laying him over the thwart. A voice said: \"Puke over the side. You\u0027ll choke to death in the bilge.\" The hands went away, but the voice left one last comment: \"Dumb fuck!\"\n The acid in Bushka\u0027s mouth was bitterly demanding, stringy. He tried to speak but every sound felt like sandpaper bobbing in his larynx. He vomited over the side, the smell strong in his nostrils. Presently, he dropped a hand into the passing sea and splashed cold salt water over his face. Only then could he sit up and look at Twisp. Bushka felt emptied of everything, all emotion drained.\n \"Where can I go?\" he asked. \"What can I tell them?\"\n \"You tell \u0027em the truth,\" Twisp said. \"Dammit. I never heard of anybody as dumb as you, but I do believe you\u0027re a dumb fuck, and I don\u0027t think you\u0027re a killer.\"\n \"Thanks,\" Bushka managed.\n \"What you did,\" Twisp said, \"you\u0027ve marked yourself. No Mute will ever get the stares you\u0027ll get. You know what? I don\u0027t envy you one bit.\"\n Twisp nodded toward the tower ahead. \"Here comes someone to get us. One of their little cargo boats. Ship! I\u0027m done for! I know it.\"\n At any given moment of history it is the function of associations of devoted individuals to undertake tasks which clear-sighted people perceive to be necessary, but which nobody else is willing to perform.\n - A. Huxley, The Doors of Perception, Shiprecords\n After seeing Scudi expose the master control panel for her father\u0027s quarters, find the hatch controls and trace out the exit hatch circuiting, Brett was ready to believe his new friend a genius. She quickly argued against this when he praised her.\n \"Most of us learn how to do this very young.\" She giggled. \"If your parents try to lock you in ...\"\n \"Why would they lock you in?\"\n \"Punishment,\" she said, \"if we -\" She broke off, threw a circuit breaker and closed the panel cover. \"Quick, someone is coming.\" She leaned close to Brett\u0027s ear. \"I have set the emergency hatch on manual and the same with the main hatch. Emergency is the little hatch in the middle of the big one.\"\n \"Where do we go when we get out?\"\n \"Remember the plan. We have to leave here before they guess what I\u0027ve done.\" Scudi took his hand and hurried Brett out of the service room, down a passage and into the entry lounge.\n Hastings and Lonfinn were already there and involved in a heated conversation with Keel.\n The Chief Justice raised his voice as Brett and Scudi entered the room: \"And furthermore, if you try to blame Islanders for the Guemes massacre, I shall demand an immediate committee of investigation, a committee you will not control!\"\n Keel rubbed his eyelids with both hands. The eye looking directly at Hastings focused a hard glare on him. Keel found he enjoyed the small shudder that the man could not hide.\n \"Mr. Justice,\" Hastings said, \"you are not helping yourself or those youngsters.\" He glanced briefly at Brett and Scudi, who had stopped just inside the room.\n Keel studied Hastings for a moment, thinking how abruptly the mood had turned ugly. Two hatchetmen! He passed a glance across Hastings and Lonfinn, noting that they blocked the way to the exit hatch.\n \"I was always told there were no dangerous insects down under,\" Keel said.\n Hastings scowled but his partner did not change expression. \"This is not a joking matter!\" Hastings said. \"Ambassador Ale has asked us to -\"\n \"Let her tell me herself!\"\n When Hastings did not respond, Keel said: \"She lured me down here under false pretenses. She saw to it that I didn\u0027t bring any of my own staff. Her stated reason, even as sketchy as that was, does not wash. I have to conclude that I am a prisoner. Do you deny that?\" Again, he sent a cold gaze across the two men standing between him and the hatch.\n Hastings sighed. \"You are being protected for your own good. You are an important Islander; there has been a crisis -\"\n \"Protected from whom?\"\n Keel watched Hastings deciding what to say, choosing and discarding alternatives. Several times Hastings started to speak and thought better of it.\n Keel rubbed the back of his neck where the prosthetic support already had begun to chafe his neck raw after his brief rest.\n \"Are you protecting me from whoever destroyed Guemes?\" he prompted.\n The two Mermen exchanged an unreadable glance. Hastings looked back at Keel. \"I would like to be more candid with you, but I can\u0027t.\"\n \"I already know the structure of what\u0027s happening,\" Keel said. \"Very powerful political forces are on a collision course among the Mermen.\"\n \"And topside!\" Hastings snapped.\n \"Oh, yes. The two wild cards - my Committee and the Faith. Wiping out Guemes was a blow at the Faith. But liquidating me would not deter the Committee; they would simply replace me. It\u0027s more effective to keep me incommunicado. Or, if I were liquidated, Islanders would be distracted enough while selecting a new Chief Justice that Mermen could take advantage of the confusion. I no longer think I can stay down here. I am returning topside.\"\n Hastings and his companion stiffened.\n \"I am afraid that is impossible just now,\" Hastings said.\n Keel smiled. \"Carolyn Bluelove will be the next Chief Justice,\" he said. \"You won\u0027t have any better luck with her than you have with me.\"\n Impasse, Keel thought.\n A loaded silence fell over the room while Hastings and Lonfinn studied him. Keel could see Hastings composing new arguments and discarding them. He needed the Chief Justice\u0027s cooperation for something - blind cooperation. He needed agreement without revealing the thing to which Keel must agree. Did Hastings think an old political infighter could not see through this dilemma?\n Where they stood just inside the room, Scudi and Brett had listened carefully to this argument. Scudi now leaned close to Brett\u0027s ear and whispered. \"The guest head is that hatch over to the right. Go in there now and open the sealed switch plate by the hatch. Throw a glass of water into the switch. That will short out all the lights in this section. I will unlock the emergency hatch. Can you find it in the dark?\"\n He nodded.\n \"We can be out before they even know we\u0027re running,\" she whispered.\n \"The passageway lights will shine in through the emergency hatch when you open it.\"\n \"We have to be quick,\" she said. \"They will try to use the main controls. It will be a blink before they realize they\u0027ll have to use the manual system.\"\n He nodded again.\n \"Follow me and run fast,\" she said. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-lazarus-effect-destination-void-3/page-15.html","bookId":2171,"book":{"id":2171,"title":"The Lazarus Effect (Destination: Void #3)","description":"Storyline: \n The Lazarus Effect (Destination: Void #3) \n The Histories assert that a binary system cannot support life.
