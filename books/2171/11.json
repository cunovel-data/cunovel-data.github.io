{"id":98902,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"\"You haven\u0027t said what you were escaping from,\" Twisp said. Another comment. \"From people who ... we\u0027d all be better off if they were dead. Damn! I should\u0027ve killed them but I couldn\u0027t bring myself to do it!\" Twisp remained silent in shock. Did all Mermen speak so casually of killing? He found his voice: \"But you sent them down under with a flooded engine room!\" And unconscious, too! But they\u0027re Mermen. They\u0027ll get out when they recover. Come on! Let\u0027s get out of here.\" \"Perhaps you didn\u0027t hear me, Iz. I\u0027m looking for a friend who went overboard from Vashon.\" \"If your friend\u0027s alive, he\u0027s safe down under. You\u0027re the only thing on the surface for at least twenty klicks. Believe it. I was looking. I came up because I saw you.\" Twisp glanced back at the distant white line of the surf. \"That\u0027s on the surface.\" \"The barrier? Yeh, but there\u0027s nothing else. No Merman base, nothing.\" Twisp considered for a moment - the way Bushka said \"Merman.\" Fear? Loathing? \"I know where there\u0027s a Search and Rescue base,\" Bushka said. \"We could be there by daybreak tomorrow. If your friend\u0027s alive ...\" He left it there. Talks a bit like an Islander, acts a lot like a Merman, Twisp thought. Damn! Where have I seen him? Twisp glanced at the distant surfline. \"You called that a barrier.\" \"Mermen are going to have land on the surface. That\u0027s part of it.\" Twisp let this sink in, not believing it or disbelieving it. Fascinating, if true, but there were other muree to fry at that moment. \"So you scuttled a sub and you\u0027re escaping from people who would be better dead.\" Twisp did not believe half of this Bushka\u0027s story. The hospitality of the sea said you had to listen. Nothing said you had to agree. Bushka sent an agitated gaze over their surroundings. Second sun was up but in this season it made a quick sweep and the half-night would be on them soon. Twisp was hungry and irritated. \"Do you have a towel and some blankets?\" Bushka asked. \"I\u0027m freezing my ass off!\" Abruptly contrite because he had failed to provide for the man\u0027s comfort, Twisp said: \"Towel and blankets are rolled up in the cuddy behind you.\" As Bushka turned and found the roll, Twisp added: \"You saw me so you came up hoping I\u0027d save you.\" Bushka looked out from beneath the towel with which he was drying his hair. \"If I\u0027d left them under CO2 any longer it would\u0027ve killed them. I couldn\u0027t do it.\" \"Are you going to tell me who they are?\" \"People who\u0027d kill us while eating lunch and not miss a bite!\" Something in the way Bushka said this set Twisp\u0027s stomach trembling. Bushka believed what he said. \"I don\u0027t suppose you have an RDC,\" Bushka said. He spoke with more than a little snobbishness. Twisp kept his temper and uncovered the instrument near his feet. His relative drift compensator was one of his proudest possessions. The compass arrow in its top was pointing now far off their course. Bushka approached and looked down at the RDC. \"A Merman compass is more accurate,\" he said, \"but this will do.\" \"Not more accurate between Islands,\" Twisp corrected him. \"Islands drift and there\u0027s no fixed point of reference.\" Bushka knelt beside the RDC and worked its settings with a sureness that told Twisp this was not the first time the man had used such an instrument. The red arrow atop the housing swung to a new setting. \"That should get us there,\" Bushka said. He shook his head. \"Sometimes I wonder how we found any place without Merman instruments.\" We? Twisp wondered. \"I think you\u0027re an Islander,\" Twisp accused, barely holding in his anger. \"We\u0027re a pretty backward lot, aren\u0027t we!\" Bushka stood and returned to his position near the opening of the cuddy. \"Better work a bit more with that towel,\" Twisp said. \"You missed behind your ears!\" Bushka ignored him and sat down with his back against the cuddy. Twisp fed more power to his motor and swung around on the course indicated by the RDC arrow. Might as well go to this Rescue Base! Damn that Bushka! Was he one of those down-under Islanders who had become more Merman than the Mermen? \"You going to tell me what happened on that sub?\" Twisp asked. \"I\u0027m through playing and I want to know what I\u0027m into.\" With a sullen expression, Bushka settled himself into his former position against the deck. Presently, he began describing his trip with Gallow. When he got to the part about Guemes Island, Twisp stopped him. \"You were at the controls?\" \"I swear to you I didn\u0027t know what he was doing.\" \"Go on. What happened next?\" Bushka picked up his story after the sinking of the Island. Twisp stared at him with a hard expression throughout the recital. Once, Twisp felt under the tiller housing behind him for the lasgun he stored there - a real Merman lasgun that had cost him half a boatload of muree. The cold touch of the weapon settled his mind somewhat. He couldn\u0027t help asking himself, What if this Bushka\u0027s lying? When Bushka finished, Twisp thought a moment, then: \"You strapped the crew into their seats, including this Gallow, and sent them to the bottom. How do you know you didn\u0027t kill them?\" \"They were tied loose enough to get free once they came around.\" \"I think I\u0027d have ...\" Twisp shook his head sharply. \"You know, don\u0027t you, that it\u0027s your word against theirs and you were at the controls?\" Bushka buried his face in the blanket around his knees. His shoulders shook and it was a few blinks before Twisp realized the man was sobbing. For Twisp, this was the ultimate intimacy between two men. He had no more doubts that the story was true. Bushka lifted a tear-streaked face to Twisp at the tiller. \"You don\u0027t know all of it. You don\u0027t know what a perfect fool I was. Fool and tool!\" It all came out, then - the bookish Islander who wanted to be a Merman, the way Gallow had fastened on this dream, luring the innocent Islander into a compromising position. \"Why didn\u0027t you take the sub back to this Rescue Base?\" Twisp asked. \"It\u0027s too far. Besides, how do I know who\u0027s with them and who\u0027s against? It\u0027s a secret organization, even from most Mermen. I saw you and ... I just had to get away from them, out of that sub.\" Hysterical kid! Twisp thought. He said, \"The Mermen won\u0027t care a lot for your scuttling their sub.\" A short, bitter laugh shook Bushka. \"Mermen don\u0027t lose anything! They\u0027re the greatest scavengers of all time. If it goes to the bottom, it\u0027s theirs.\" Twisp nodded. \"Interesting story, Iz. Now I\u0027ll tell you what happened. The part about Guemes, I believe that and I -\" \"It\u0027s true!\" \"I\u0027d like to disbelieve you, but I don\u0027t. I also think you got sucked into it by this Gallow. But I don\u0027t think you\u0027re all as innocent as you let on.\" \"I swear to you, I didn\u0027t know what he intended!\" \"Okay, Iz. I believe you. I believe you saw me on the sub\u0027s scanner. You came up intending to be rescued by me.\" Bushka scowled. Twisp nodded. \"You swam at an angle away from me so I\u0027d be sure to go after you instead of making a try for the sub. You wanted to pass yourself off as Merman, have me take you to this base, and you were going to use your knowledge of the Guemes destruction to insure that Mermen really made good on keeping you down under. You were going to trade that for -\" \"I wasn\u0027t! I swear.\" \"Don\u0027t swear,\" Twisp said. \"Ship\u0027s listening.\" Bushka started to speak, thought better of it and remained silent. A religious bluff usually worked with Islanders, even if they claimed nonbelief. Twisp said: \"What did you do topside? What Island?\" \"Eagle. I was a ... historian and pump-control tech.\" \"You\u0027ve been to Vashon?\" \"A couple of times.\" \"That\u0027s probably where I saw you. I seldom forget a face. Historian, eh? Inside a lot. That accounts for your pale complexion.\" \"Have you any idea,\" Bushka asked, \"of the historical records the Mermen have preserved? The Mermen themselves don\u0027t even know everything they have. Or the value of it.\" \"So this Gallow saw you as valuable to record his doings?\" \"That\u0027s what he said.\" \"Making history\u0027s a little different from writing it. I guess you found that out.\" \"Ship knows I did!\" \"Uh huh. Bushka, for now, we\u0027re stuck with each other. I\u0027m not going to throw you overboard. But your story doesn\u0027t make me comfortable, you understand? If there\u0027s a base where you say there\u0027s one ... well, we\u0027ll see.\" \"There\u0027s a base,\" Bushka said. \"With a tower sticking out of the water so far you can see it for fifty klicks.\" \"Sure there is,\" Twisp said. \"Meanwhile, you stay over there by the cuddy and I\u0027ll stay here at the tiller. Don\u0027t try to leave your position. Got that?\" Bushka put his face back into the blanket without answering. By the rocking of his body and the shaking sobs, it was obvious to Twisp that he\u0027d heard. What\u0027s so tough about making love to a Mute? Finding the right orifice. - Merman joke Following Ale at a pace painful for his old and weak legs, Ward Keel stepped through a hatchway marked by a red circle. He found himself in a roomful of noisy activity. There were many viewscreens, every one attended by a tech, at least a dozen console desks with Merman-style control switches and graphics. Alphanumerical indicators flashed wherever he looked. He counted ten very large viewscreens showing underwater and topside vistas. It all had been crowded into a space only a bit larger than Ale\u0027s quarters. But it\u0027s not cramped, he thought. Somewhat like Islanders, these Mermen had become skillful at using limited areas, although Keel noted that what they thought small an Islander would see as spacious. Ale moved him around the desks and screens for introductions. Each worker glanced up when introduced, nodded curtly and returned to work. From the looks they shot Ale, Keel could tell that his presence in this room was particularly distressing to several of the Mermen. She stopped him at a slightly larger desk set on a low dais to command the entire room. Ale had called the young man at this desk \"Shadow\" but introduced him as Dark Panille. Keel recognized the surname - a descendant of the pioneer poet and historian, no doubt. Panille\u0027s large eyes stared out with demanding focus over high cheekbones. His mouth moved only minimally from its straight line when he acknowledged the introduction. \"What is this place?\" Keel asked. \"Current Control,\" Ale said, \"You\u0027ll learn details momentarily. They are involved in an emergency right now. We must not interfere. You see those orange lights flashing over there? Emergency calls for Search and Rescue teams who are on standby duty.\" \"Search and Rescue?\" Keel asked. \"Are some of your people in trouble?\" \"No,\" she replied with a tight set to her jaw, \"your people.\" Keel clamped his mouth shut. His gaze skittered across the room at the intense faces studying each viewscreen, at the cacophony of typing set up by the blur of two dozen technicians\u0027 hands at their keyboards. It was all very confusing. Was this the beginning of that threat Ale had mentioned? Keel found it difficult to remain silent ... but she had said \"Search and Rescue.\" This was a time to watch carefully and record. Immediately after the medics had passed their death sentence on him, Keel had begun to feel that he was living in a vacuum that desperately needed filling. He felt that even his long service on the Committee on Vital Forms had been emptied. It was not enough to have been Chief Justice. There must be something more ... a thing to mark his end with style, showing the love he had for his fellows. He wanted to send a message down the long corridors that said: \"This is how much I cared.\" Perhaps there was a key to his need in this room. Ale whispered in his ear. \"Shadow - his friends call him that, a more pleasant name than \u0027Dark\u0027 - he\u0027s our ablest coordinator. He has a very high success rate recovering Islander castaways.\" Was she hoping to impress him with her benign concern for Islander lives? Keel spoke in a low voice, his tone dry: \"I didn\u0027t know it was this formalized.\" \"You thought we left it to chance?\" she asked. Keel noted the slight snort of disgust. \"We always watch out for Islanders in a storm or during a wavewall.\" Keel felt an emotional pang at this revelation. His pride had been touched. \"Why haven\u0027t you made it known that you do this for us?\" he asked. \"You think Islander pride would abide such a close watch?\" Ale asked. \"You forget, Ward, that I live much topside. You already believe we\u0027re plotting against you. What would your people make of this set-up?\" She gestured at the banks of controls, the viewscreens, the subdued clicking of printers. \"You think Islanders are paranoid,\" Keel said. He was forced to admit to himself that this room\u0027s purpose had hurt his pride. Vashon Security would not like the idea of such Merman surveillance, either. And their fears might be correct. Keel reminded himself that he was only seeing what he was shown. A large screen over to the right displayed a massive section of Island hull. \"That looks like Vashon,\" he said. \"I recognize the drift-watch spacing.\" Ale touched Panille\u0027s shoulder and Keel wondered at the proprietary air of her movement. Panille glanced up from the keys. \"An interruption?\" she asked. \"Make it short.\" \"Could you put Justice Keel\u0027s fears to rest? He has recognized his Island there.\" She nodded toward the viewscreen on the right. \"Give him its position relative to the nearest barrier wall.\" Panille turned to his console and tapped out a code, twisted a dial and read the alphanumerics on a thin dark strip at the top of his board. The smaller screen above the readout shifted from a repeat of the hull view to a surrounding seascape. A square at the lower right of the screen flashed \"V-200.\" \"Visibility two hundred meters,\" Ale said. \"Pretty good.\" \"Vashon\u0027s about four kilometers out from submerged barrier HA-nine, moving parallel the wall,\" Panille said. \"In about an hour we\u0027ll begin to take it farther out. The wavewall had it within two-kilometer range. We had to do some shuffling, but nothing to worry about. It was never out of control.\" Keel had to suppress a gasp at these figures. He fought down anger at the younger man\u0027s presumption and managed to ask, \"What do you mean, \u0027Nothing to worry about\u0027?\" Panille said, \"We have had it under control -\" \"Young man, diverting a mass like Vashon\" - Keel shook his head -\"we\u0027re lucky to adjust basic positioning when we contact another Island. Getting out of the way of danger in a mere two kilometers is not possible.\" The corners of Panille\u0027s mouth came up in a tight smile - the kind of know-it-all smile that Keel really hated. He saw it on many adolescents, sophomoric youths thinking that older people were just too slow. \"You Islanders don\u0027t have the kelp working for you,\" Panille said. \"We do. That\u0027s why we\u0027re here and we haven\u0027t time for your Islander paranoia.\" \"Shadow!\" Ale\u0027s voice carried a cautionary note. \"Sorry.\" Panille bent to his controls. \"But the kelp gives us a control that has kept Vashon out of real danger through this area for the past few years. Other Islands, too.\" What an astonishing claim! Keel thought. He noted from the edge of his vision how carefully Ale watched every move Panille made. The young man nodded at something on his readouts. \"Watch this,\" he said. \"Landro!\" An older woman across the room glanced back and nodded. Panille called out a series of letters and numbers to her. She tapped them into her console, paused, hit a key, paused. Panille bent to his own board. A flurry of movement erupted from his fingers across the keys. \"Watch Shadow\u0027s screen,\" Ale said. The screen showed a long stretch of waving kelp, thick and deep. The V-200 still blinked in the corner square. From it, Keel estimated he was looking at kelp more than a hundred meters tall. As he watched, a side channel opened through the kelp, the thick strands bending aside and locking onto their neighbors. The channel appeared to be at least thirty meters wide. \"Kelp controls the currents by opening appropriate channels,\" Ale said. \"You\u0027re seeing one of the kelp\u0027s most primitive feeding behaviors. It captures nutrient-rich colder currents this way.\" Keel spoke in a hushed whisper. \"How do you make it respond?\" \"Low-frequency signals,\" she said. \"We haven\u0027t perfected it yet, but we\u0027re close. This is rather crude if we believe the historical records. We expect the kelp to add a visual display to its vocabulary at the next stage of development.\" \"Are you trying to tell me you\u0027re talking to it?\" \"In a crude way. The way a mother talks to an infant, that kind of thing. We can\u0027t call it sentient yet, it doesn\u0027t make independent decisions.\" Keel began to understand Panille\u0027s know-it-all look. How many generations had Islanders been on the sea without even coming close to such a development? What else did Islanders lack that Mermen had perfected? \"Because it\u0027s crude we allow plenty of margin for error,\" Ale said. \"Four kilometers ... that\u0027s safe?\" Keel asked. \"Two kilometers,\" Panille said. \"That\u0027s an acceptable distance now.\" \"The kelp responds to a series of signal clusters,\" Ale said. Why this sudden candor with Vashon\u0027s highest Islander official? Keel wondered. \"As you can see,\" Ale said, \"we\u0027re training the kelp as we use it.\" She took his arm and stared at the widening channel through the kelp. Keel saw Panille glance at Ale\u0027s intimate grip and caught a brief hardening of the young man\u0027s mouth. Jealous? Keel wondered. The thought flickered like a candle in a breezy room. Perhaps a way to put Panille off-balance. Keel patted Ale\u0027s hand. \"You see why I brought you in here?\" Ale asked. Keel tried to clear his throat, finding it painfully restricted. Islanders would have to learn about this development, of course. He began to see Ale\u0027s problem - the Merman problem. They had made a mistake in not sharing this development earlier. Or had they? \"We have other things to see,\" Ale said. \"I think the gymnasium next because it\u0027s closest. That\u0027s where we\u0027re training our astronauts.\" Keel had been turning slightly as she spoke, scanning the curve of screens across the room. His mind was only partly focused on Ale\u0027s words and he heard them almost as an afterthought. He lurched and stumbled into her, only her strong grip on his arm kept him steady. \"I know you\u0027re going after the hyb tanks,\" he said. \"Ship would not have left them in orbit if it was not intended for us to have them, Ward.\" So that\u0027s why you\u0027re building your barriers and recovering solid ground above the sea.\" \"We can launch rockets from down here but that\u0027s not the best way,\" she said. \"We need a solid base above the sea.\" \"What will you do with the contents of the tanks?\" \"If the records are correct, and we\u0027ve no reason to doubt them, then the riches of life in those tanks will put us back on a human path - a human way.\" \"What\u0027s a human way?\" he asked. \"Why, it\u0027s ... Ward, the life forms in those tanks can ...\" \"I\u0027ve studied the records. What do you expect to gain on Pandora from, say, a rhesus monkey? Or a python? How will a mongoose benefit us?\" \"Ward ... there are cows, pigs, chickens ...\" \"And whales, how can they help us? Can they live compatibly with the kelp? You\u0027ve pointed out the importance of the kelp ...\" \"We won\u0027t know until we try it, will we?\" \"As Chief Justice on the Committee on Vital Forms, and that is who you\u0027re addressing now, Kareen Ale, I must remind you that I have considered such questions before.\" \"Ship and our ancestors brought -\" \"Why this sudden religious streak, Kareen? Ship and our ancestors brought chaos to Pandora. They did not consider the consequences of their actions. Look at me, Kareen! I am one of those consequences. Clones ... mutants ... I ask you, was it not Ship\u0027s purpose to teach us a hard lesson?\" \"What lesson?\" \"That there are some changes that can destroy us. You speak so glibly of a human way of life! Have you defined what it is to be human?\" \"Ward ... we\u0027re both human.\" \"Like me, Kareen. That\u0027s how we judge. Human is \u0027like me.\u0027 In our guts, we say: It\u0027s human if it\u0027s \u0027like me.\u0027\" \"Is that how you judge on the Committee?\" Her tone was scornful, or hurt. \"Indeed, it is. But I paint the likeness with a very broad brush. How broad is your brush? For that matter, this scornful young man seated here, could he look at me and say, \u0027like me\u0027?\" Panille did not look up but his neck turned red and he bent intently over his console. \"Shadow and his people save Islander lives,\" she remarked. \"Indeed,\" Keel said, \"and I\u0027m grateful. However, I would like to know whether he believes he is saving fellow humans or an interesting lower life form? \"We live in different environments, Kareen. Those different environments require different customs. That\u0027s all. But I\u0027ve begun to ask myself why we Islanders allow ourselves to be manipulated by your standards of beauty. Could you, for example, consider me as a mate?\" He put up a hand to stop her reply and noticed that Panille was doing his best to ignore their conversation. \"I don\u0027t seriously propose it,\" Keel said. \"Think about everything involved in it. Think how sad it is that I have to bring it up.\" Choosing her words carefully, spacing them with definite pauses, Ale said, \"You are the most difficult ... human being ... I have ever met.\" \"Is that why you brought me here? If you can convince me, you can convince anyone?\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-lazarus-effect-destination-void-3/page-11.html","bookId":2171,"book":{"id":2171,"title":"The Lazarus Effect (Destination: Void #3)","description":"Storyline: The Lazarus Effect (Destination: Void #3) The Histories assert that a binary system cannot support life.
