I agree that we should have brought Islanders into the planning picture much earlier, but\" - she shrugged - \"we didn\u0027t. And now we are. It\u0027s my job to tell you what we must do together to see that there is no disaster.

We must walk on the surface once more, all of us.\"\n He heard the sincerity in her tone but distrusted it. She was a diplomat, trained to lie convincingly. And the enormity of what she proposed ...\n Ale waved a hand toward the exterior garden. \"Kelp is flourishing, as you can see. But it\u0027s just a plant; it is not sentient, as it was before our ancestors wiped it out. The kelp you see there was, of course, reconstructed from the genes carried by certain humans in the -\"\n \"Don\u0027t try to explain genetics to the Chief Justice,\" Ward growled, \"we know about your \u0027dumbkelp.\u0027\"\n She blushed, and he wondered at the emotional display. It was something he had never before seen in Ale. A liability in a diplomat, no doubt. How had she concealed it before ... or was this situation simply too much for normal repression? He decided to watch the emotional signal and read it for her true feelings.\n \"Calling it \u0027dumbkelp\u0027 like the schoolchildren is hardly accurate,\" she said.\n \"You\u0027re trying to divert me,\" he accused. \"How close is Vashon to one of your surflines right now?\"\n \"In a few minutes I will take you out and show you,\" she said. \"But you must understand what we\u0027re -\"\n \"No. I must not understand - by which you mean accept - such peril for so many of my people. So many people, period. You talk of control. Do you have any idea of the energy in an Island\u0027s movement? The long, slow job of maneuvering something that big? Your word, this control of which you seem so proud, does not take in the kinetic energy of -\"\n \"But it does, Ward. I didn\u0027t bring you down here for a tea party. Or an argument.\" She stood. \"I hope you have your legs under you because we\u0027ve a lot of walking to do.\"\n He stood at that, slowly, and tried to unkink his knees. His left foot tingled in the first stages of waking. Was it possible, all that she said? He could not escape the in-built fear all Islanders felt at the idea of a crashing death on solid bottom. A white horizon could only mean death - a wavewall or some tidal exposure of the planet\u0027s rocky surface. Nothing could change that.\n How do Mermen make love? Same way every time.\n - Islander joke\n The two coracles, one towing the other, bobbed along on the open sea. Nothing shared the horizon with them except gray waves, long deep rollers with intermittent white lines of spume at the crests. Vashon was long gone below the horizon astern and Twisp, holding his course by the steady wind and the fisherman\u0027s instinct for shifts in light, had settled into a patient, watchful wait, giving only rare glances to his radio and RDF. He had been all night assembling the gear to hunt for Brett - raising the coracles, repairing the wavewall damage, loading supplies and gear.\n Around him now was a Pandoran late morning. Only Little Sun was in the sky, a bright spot on a thin cloud cover - ideal navigation weather. Driftwatch had given him a fix on Vashon\u0027s position at the time of the wavewall and he knew that by midafternoon he should be near enough to start search-quartering the seas.\n If you made it this far, kid, I\u0027ll find you.\n The futility of his gesture did not escape Twisp. There was nearly a day\u0027s delay, not to mention the ever-prowling hunts of dashers. And there was this odd current in the sea, sending a long silvery line down the sweep of waves. It flowed in his direction, for which Twisp was thankful. He could mark the swiftness of it by the doppler on his radio, which he kept tuned to Vashon\u0027s emergency band. He hoped to hear a report of Brett\u0027s recovery.\n It was possible that Mermen had found Brett. Twisp kept looking for Merman signs - a flag float for a work party, one of their swift skimmers, the oily surge of a hardbelly sub surfacing from the depths.\n Nothing intruded on his small circle of horizon.\n Getting away from Vashon had been a marvel of secret scurrying, all the time expecting Security to stop him. But Islanders helped each other, even if one of them insisted on being a fool. Gerard had packed him a rich supply of food gifts from friends and from the pantry at the Ace of Cups. Security had been informed of Brett\u0027s loss overboard. Gerard\u0027s private grapevine said the kid\u0027s parents had set up a cry for \"someone to do something.\" They had not come to Twisp, though. Strange, that. Official channels only. Twisp suspected Security knew all about his preparations for a search and deliberately kept hands off - partly out of resentment over the Norton family pressures, partly ... well, partly because Islanders helped each other. People knew he had to do this thing.\n The docks had been a madhouse of repair when Twisp went down to see whether he could recover his boat. Despite the hard work going on all around, fishermen made time to help him. Brett had been the only person lost with this wavewall and they all knew what Twisp had to attempt.\n All through the night people had come with gear, sonar, a spare coracle, a new motor, eelcell batteries, every gift saying: \"We know. We sympathize. I\u0027d be doing the same thing if I were you.\"\n At the end, ready to set off, Twisp had waited impatiently for Gerard to appear. Gerard had said for him to wait. The big man had come down in his motorized chair, his single fused leg sticking out like a blunted lance to clear the way. His twin daughters ran skipping behind him, and behind them came five Ace of Cups regulars wheeling carts with the food stores.\n \"Got you enough for about twenty-five or thirty days,\" Gerard had said, humming to a stop beside the waiting boats. \"I know you, Twisp. You won\u0027t give up.\"\n An embarrassed silence had fallen over the fishermen waiting on the docks to see Twisp off. Gerard had spoken what was in all of their minds. How long could the kid survive out there?\n While friends loaded the tow-coracle, Gerard said: \"Word\u0027s out to the Mermen. They\u0027ll contact us if they learn anything. Hard telling what it\u0027ll cost you.\"\n Twisp had stared at his coracles, at the friends who gave him precious gear and even more precious physical help. The debt was great. And if he came back ... well, he was going to come back - and with the kid. The debt would be a bitch, though. And only a few hours ago he had been considering abandonment of the independent fisherman\u0027s life, going back to the subs. Well ... that was the way it went.\n Gerard\u0027s twin girls had come up to Twisp then, begging for him to swing them. The coracles were almost ready and a strange reluctance had come over everyone ... including Twisp. He extended his arms to let each of the girls grip a forearm tight, then he turned, fast, faster, swinging the children wide while the spectators stood back from his long-armed circle. The girls shrieked when their toes pointed at the horizon. He stumbled to a stop, dizzy and sweating. Both girls sat hard on the pier, their eyes not quite caught up with the end of the whirl.\n \"You come back, you hear?\" Gerard had said. \"My girls won\u0027t forgive any of us if you don\u0027t.\"\n Twisp thought about that oddly silent departure as he held his course with the wind on his cheek and an eye to the light and the swift hiss of the current under his craft. The old axiom of the fishing fleets nurtured him in his loneliness: Your best friend is hope.\n He could feel the tow coracle tug his boat at the crests. The carrier hum of his radio provided a faint background to the slap-slap of cross-chop against the hull. He glanced back at the tow. Only the static-charge antenna protruded from the lashed cover. The tow rode low in the water. The new motor hummed reassuringly near his feet. Its eelcell batteries had not started to change color, but he kept an eye on them. Unless the antenna picked up a lightning strike, they\u0027d need feeding before nightfall.\n Gray convolutions of clouds folded downward ahead of him. Sometime soon it was going to rain. He unrolled the clear membrane another fisherman had given him and stretched it over the open cockpit of his coracle, leaving a sag-pocket to collect drinking water. The course beeper went off as he finished the final lashings. He corrected for slightly more than five degrees deviation, then hunkered under the shelter, sensing the imminent rain, cursing the way this would limit visibility. But he had to keep dry.\n I never really get miserable if I\u0027m dry.\n He felt miserable, though. Was there even the faintest hope he could find the kid? Or was this one of those futile gestures that had to be made for one\u0027s own mental well-being?\n Or is it that I have nothing else to live for ... ?\n He put that one out of his mind as beyond debate. To give himself physical activity, something to drive out his doubts, he rigged a handline with a warning bell from the starboard thwart, baited it with a bit of bright streamer that glittered in the water. He payed it out carefully and tested the warning bell with a short tug on the line. The tinkling reassured him.\n All I\u0027d need, he thought. Drag a dead fish along and call in the dashers. Even though dashers preferred warm-blooded meat, they\u0027d go for anything that moved when they were hungry.\n A lot like humans.\n Settling back with the tiller under his right armpit, Twisp tried to relax. Still nothing on the radio\u0027s emergency band. He reached down and switched to the regular broadcast, coming in on the middle of a music program.\n Another gift, a nav-sounder, with its bottom-finding sonar and its store of position memories, rested between his legs. He flipped it on for a position check, worked out the doppler distance figure from the radio and nodded to himself.\n Close enough.\n Vashon was drifting at a fairly steady seven klicks per hour back there. His coracle was doing a reliable twelve. Pretty fast for trolling with a handline.\n The radio interrupted its music program for a commentary on Chief Justice Keel. No word yet from the Committee, but observers were saying that his unprecedented fact-finding trip down under could have \"deep significance to Vashon and all other Islands.\"\n What significance? Twisp wondered.\n Keel was an important man, but Twisp had trouble extending that importance beyond Vashon. Occasional grumbles over a decision swept through the Island communities, but there had been few real disturbances since Keel\u0027s elevation, and that was some time back. Sure sign that he was a wise man.\n The C/P had been asked to comment on Keel\u0027s mission, however, and this aroused Twisp\u0027s curiosity. What did the old Shipside religion have to do with the Chief Justice\u0027s trip? Twisp had always paid only cursory attention to both politics and religion. They were good for an occasional jawing session at the Ace of Cups, but Twisp had always found himself unable to understand what drove people to passionate arguments over \"Ship\u0027s real purpose.\"\n Who the hell knew what Ship\u0027s real purpose had been? There might not have been a purpose!\n It was possible, though, that the old religion was gaining new strength among Islanders. It was certainly an unspoken issue between Mermen and Islanders. There was enough polarization already between topside and down under - diplomats arguing about the \"functional abilities\" characteristic of Pandora\u0027s split population. Islanders claimed eminence in agriculture, textiles and meteorology. Mermen always bragged they had the bodies best adapted for going back to the land.\n Stupid argument! Twisp always noticed that a group of people - Islander or Merman - got less intelligent with every member added. If humans can master that one, they\u0027ve got it made, he thought.\n Twisp sensed something big was afoot. He felt well away from it out in the open sea. No Ship here. No C/P. No religious fanatics - just one seasoned agnostic.\n Was Ship God? Who the hell cared now? Ship had abandoned them for sure and nothing else of Ship really mattered.\n A long, sweeping roller lifted the coracle easily to almost twice the height of the prevailing seas. He glanced around from the brief vantage and saw something large bobbing on the water far ahead. Whatever it was, it lay in the silvery channel of the odd current, which was adding to his forward speed. He kept his attention ahead until he picked up the unknown thing much closer, realizing then that it was several things clumped together. A few minutes later he recognized the objects in the clump.\n Dashers!\n The squawks lay quiet, though. He glanced at them as he put a hand on the field switch, ready to repel the hunt when they attacked. None of the dashers moved.\n That\u0027s strange, he thought. Never seen dashers sit still before.\n He lifted his head, raising the catchment sag of his cockpit cover, and peered ahead. As the coracle neared the clump, Twisp counted seven adults and a tighter cluster of young dashers in the center of the group. They rode the waves together like a dark chunk of bubbly.\n Dead, he realized. A whole hunt of dashers and all of them dead. What killed them?\n Twisp eased back the throttle, but still kept a hand on the field switch ... just in case. They were dead, though, not pretending as a ruse to lure him close. The dashers had locked themselves into a protective circle. Each adult linked a rear leg to the adult on either side. They formed a circle with forepaws and fangs facing out, the young inside.\n Twisp set a course around them, staring in at the dashers. How long had they been dead? He was tempted to stop and skin at least one. Dasher skins always brought a good price. But it would take precious time and the hides would rob him of space.\n They\u0027d stink, too.\n He circled a bit closer. Up close now he could see how dashers had adapted so quickly to water. Hollow hairs - millions of trapped air cells that became an efficient flotation system when sea covered all of Pandora\u0027s land. Legend said dashers once had feared the water, that the hollow hairs insulated them then against cold nights and oven-hot days among the desert rocks. Because of those hollow hairs, dasher hides made beautiful blankets - light and warm. Again, he was tempted to skin some of them. They were all in pretty good shape. Have to jettison part of his survival cargo if he did, though. What could he spare?\n One of the dashers displayed a great hood that floated out from its ugly, leather-skinned head like a black mantle. Experts said this was a throwback characteristic. Most dashers had shed the hood in the sea, becoming sleek killing machines with saber fangs and those knife-sharp claws, almost fifteen centimeters long on the bigger animals.\n Lifting a corner of his cockpit cover, he poked at the hooded dasher with a boathook, lifting it far enough to see that the underside had been burned. A deep, crisp line from brisket to belly. The limpness of the beast told him it couldn\u0027t have been dead more than a few hours. A half-day, at the most. He withdrew the boathook and refastened the cockpit cover.\n Burned? he wondered. What had surprised and killed this entire hunt - from below?\n Swinging the tiller, he resumed his course down the silvery channel of current, checking by compass and the relative signal from Vashon. The radio was still playing popular music. Soon, the mysterious clump of dashers lay below the horizon astern.\n The clouds had lifted slightly and still there was no rain. He gauged his course by the bright spot on the clouds, the uncertain compass and the ripple of steady wind across the transparent cover above him. The wind drove spray runnels in parallel lines, giving him a good reading on relative direction.\n His thoughts turned back to the dashers. He was convinced that Mermen had killed them from beneath, but how? A Merman sub crew, maybe. If this were an example of a Merman weapon, Islands were virtually defenseless.\n Now, why would I think Mermen would attack us?\n Mermen and Islanders might be polarized, but war was ancient history, known only through records saved from the Clone Wars. And Mermen were known to go to great trouble to save Islander lives.\n But the whole planet was a hiding place if you lived down under. And Mermen did want Vata, that was true. Always coming up with petitions demanding that she be moved to \"safer and more comfortable quarters down under.\"\n \"Vata is the key to kelp consciousness,\" the Mermen said. They said it so often it had become a cliche, but the C/P seemed to agree. Twisp had never believed everything the C/P said, but this was something he kept to himself.\n In Twisp\u0027s opinion, it was a power struggle. Vata, living on and on like that with her companion, Duque, beside her, was the nearest thing Pandora had to a living saint. You could start almost any story you wanted about why she lay there without responding.\n \"She is waiting for the return of Ship,\" some said.\n But Twisp had a tech friend who was called in occasionally by the C/P to examine and maintain the nutrient tank in which Vata and Duque lived. The tech laughed at this story.\n \"She\u0027s not doing anything but living,\" the tech said. \"And I\u0027ll bet she has no idea she\u0027s even doing that!\"\n \"But she does have kelp genes?\" Twisp had asked.\n \"Sure. We\u0027ve run tests when the religious mumbo-jumbos and the Mermen observers have their backs turned. A few cells is all it takes, you know. The C/P would be livid. Vata has kelp genes, I\u0027ll swear to that.\"\n \"So the Mermen could be right about her?\"\n \"Who the fuck knows?\" The tech grinned. \"Lots of us have \u0027em. Everybody\u0027s different, though. Maybe she did get the right batch. Or, for all we really know, Jesus Lewis was Satan, like the C/P says. And Pandora\u0027s Satan\u0027s pet project.\"\n The tech\u0027s revelations did little to change Twisp\u0027s basic opinions.\n It\u0027s all politics. And politics is all property.\n Lately everything came down to license fees, forms and supporting the right political group. If you had someone on the inside helping you, things went well - your property didn\u0027t cost you so much. Otherwise, forget it. Resentments, jealousy, envy ... these were the things really running Pandora. And fear. He\u0027d seen plenty of fear in the faces of Mermen confronted by the more severely changed Islanders. People even Twisp sometimes thought of as Mutes. Fear bordering on horror, disgust, loathing. It was all emotions and he knew politics was at the bottom of it, too - \"Dear Ship,\" the horrified Mermen were saying with their unmasked faces, \"don\u0027t let me or anybody I love own a body like that!\"\n The beeper interrupted Twisp\u0027s black thoughts. Sonar said his depth here was a little under one hundred meters. He glanced around at the open sea. The silvery current-channel had been joined by tributaries on both sides. He could feel the current churn beneath his coracle. Bits of flotsam shared the water around him now - kelp tendrils mostly, some short lengths of floating bone. Those would have to be from squawks. Wouldn\u0027t float otherwise.\n A hundred meters, he thought. Pretty shallow. Vashon drew just about that much at Center. Mermen preferred building where it remained shallow most of the time, he recalled. Was this a Merman area? He looked around for signs: dive floats, the surface boiling with a sub\u0027s backwash or a foil coming up from the depths. There was only the sea and the folding current that swept him along in its steady grip. Lots of kelp shreds in this current. Could be an area where Mermen were replanting the stuff. Twisp had found himself taking the Merman side on that project in many a bar argument. More kelp meant more cover and feed for fish. Nursery areas. More fish meant more food for the Islands and for Mermen. In more predictable locations.\n His depth finder said the bottom was holding steady at ninety meters. Mermen had reason to prefer shallows. Better for the kelp. Easier to trade topside, as long as Islands had plenty of clearance. And there were all those stories that the Mermen were trying to reclaim land on the surface. There might be a Merman outpost or trading station nearby and they could give him word on whether they had rescued the kid. Besides, the little he knew about Mermen made him that much more fascinated by them, and the prospect of contact excited him for its own sake.\n Twisp began to build a fantasy - a dream-truth that Mermen had saved Brett. He scooped a handful of the kelp and found himself daydreaming that Brett had been rescued by a beautiful young Merman girl and was falling in love somewhere down under.\n Damn! I\u0027ve got to stop that, he thought. The dream collapsed. Bits of it kept coming back to him, though, and he had to repress them sharply.\n Hope was one thing, he thought. Fantasy was quite another thing ... and dangerous.\n This may be the better age for the Faith, but this is certainly not an age of Faith.\n - Flannery O\u0027Connor, from her letters, Shiprecords\n Those who watched Vata that day said her hair was alive, that it clutched her head and shoulders. As Vata\u0027s agitation grew her shudders became a steadily progressing convulsion. Her thick spread of hair snaked itself around her and curled her gently into a fetal ball.\n The convulsions tapered off and ceased in two minutes, twelve seconds. Four minutes and twenty-four seconds after that, the tendrils of her hair became hair again. A thick spread of it fanned out behind her. She stayed in that position, tight and rigid, through three full shifts of watchers.\n The C/P was not the first to equate the agitation in the tank with the sinking of Guemes, nor was she the last. She was, however, the only one who wasn\u0027t surprised.\n Not now! she thought, as though she could ever have found a convenient time for thousands of people to die. That was why she needed Gallow. This was something she could live with if it were done, but it was not something that she could do. None of that diminished the horrors she was forced to imagine as Vata lay writhing in her tank.\n And scooped up like that by her hair! This thought raised every thin stalk on the back of the C/P\u0027s shoulders and neck.\n At Vata\u0027s first abrupt stirrings, Duque had stiffened, flinched, then slipped quickly and deeply into shock. His only coherent utterance was a high-pitched, quickly blurted, \"Ma!\"\n Those med-techs among the watchers, Islander and Merman alike, vaulted the rim of the pool.\n \"What\u0027s wrong with him?\" a young clerk asked. She was chinless and hook-nosed, but not at all unpretty. The C/P noticed her wide green eyes and the white eyelashes that flickered as she spoke.\n Rocksack pointed at the telltales above the monitor center across the pool. \"Fast, high heartbeat, agitation, shallow breathing, steadily dropping blood pressure - shock. Nothing touched him and they\u0027ve ruled out stroke or internal bleeding.\" The C/P cleared her throat. \"Psychogenic shock,\" she said. \"Something scared him almost to death.\"\n Forceful rejection of the past is the coward\u0027s way of removing inconvenient knowledge.\n - the Histories\n The weather around Twisp had shifted from scattered showers to a warm wind with clear skies directly overhead. Little Sun was wending its way toward the horizon. Twisp checked the rain water he had recovered - almost four liters. He removed the cockpit cover, rolled it forward and lashed it in place where it could be snatched back quickly if the weather changed once more.\n He thought only briefly of the daydream he had entertained about Brett and a beautiful Merman woman. What nonsense! Mermen wanted normal children. Brett would only find disappointment down under. One look at his big eyes and parents would steer their daughters away from him. Islander births might be stabilizing, more births in the pattern of Gerard\u0027s girls, more near-normals like Brett every season, but that changed nothing in basic attitudes. Mermen were Mermen and Islanders were Islanders. Islanders were catching up, though: fewer lethal deviants and longer life spans.\n The warning beeper on Twisp\u0027s depth finder sounded once, and again. He glanced at it and reset the lower limit. The sea had been shallowing here for some time. Only seventy-five meters now. Fifty meters and he could start trying to see bottom. One of his dockside gifts had been a small driftwatcher, organic and delicately beautiful. It held corneal material at one end that would focus at his demand. At the other end, a mouth-like aperture fitted itself over his eyes. The thing could only exist immersed most of the time in nutrient, and it grew inexorably, eventually becoming too large for a small boat. Custom dictated that it then be passed along to a larger boat. Twisp ran a hand absently along the smooth organic tube of the thing, feeling its automatic response. He sighed. What could he hope to find on the bottom even if it did get shallow enough? He removed his hand from the little driftwatcher and lifted his attention to his surroundings.\n The air felt warm, almost balmy and quite moist after the rains. The seas were calmer. Only that shifting, boiling current stretched ahead of him and for more than a kilometer on both sides. Odd. He had never seen a current quite like it, but then Pandora was always turning up new things. The one constant was the weather: It changed and it changed fast. He looked east at the cloud bank there, noting how far toward the horizon Little Sun had moved. Big Sun would come up soon - more light, more visibility. He glanced back at the strip of rich blue along the horizon. Yes, it was clearing. The dark bank of clouds east of him receded faster than his motor and the current chased it. Sunlight tapped his cheeks, his arms. He settled back beside the tiller, feeling the warmth like an old friend. It was as though Pandora had smiled upon his venture. He knew he was very close to where the wave wall had struck Vashon, and now visibility opened up. He moved his gaze around the horizon, seeking a black speck that was not the sea.\n I\u0027m here, kid.\n His gaze, sweeping left, glimpsed a distinct line of froth. The sight of it prickled the hairs on his neck and sent a chill down his spine. He sat stiffly upright, staring.\n A white line on the sea!\n Wavewall? No ... it wasn\u0027t growing larger or receding. Just off to the left of his course and dead ahead a white line of foam grew more distinct as he approached. Sonar read fifty meters. He slipped the little driftwatcher from its container and fixed it to the coracle\u0027s side with the corneal end underwater. Fitting his forehead to the mouth aperture, he stared downward.\n When his eyes adjusted, the view took a moment shaping itself into something identifiable. It was not the rolling contour of the deeps, which he had seen from the subs. It was not the jagged, surreal landscape of the danger areas. This bottom climbed high, almost to the surface. Twisp tore his gaze away from the driftwatcher and looked at the sonar reading: twenty meters!\n He returned his attention to the bottom. It was so shallow he could see delicate, sinewy steps - curving terraces covered with kelp fronds. Rock buttresses and walls guarded the outer edges of the terraces. It all looked artificial ... manmade.\n A core of the Merman kelp project! he thought.\n He had seen many segments of the project, but this was vastly different and, he suspected, much larger. Merman engineers experimented with the kelp, he knew that. Supposedly some of the beds would live and grow even on land - if there ever was such a thing. Now Twisp found himself much closer to believing - if this bed was an example. Mermen were doing all that they claimed they\u0027d do. He\u0027d seen the fine latticework strung for kilometers undersea, a structure where the kelp could climb and secure itself. Undersea walls of rock sheltered other plantations. Islanders had complained about the latticework supports, arguing that they were nets to entangle the fishing subs. Twisp had doubted this argument, remembering all the stories of net-bound Mermen. Islander complaints had not stopped the project.\n He gave up studying the bottom and looked at the foam line again. The silvery current that carried him curved off to starboard, sweeping close to that disquieting line. He guessed the intersection to be about five klicks off. A distant, recurrent roar accompanied the surfline.\n Could it be waves foaming across one of the latticeworks? he wondered.\n Both coracles bobbed heavily in a cross-chop, the towed craft pulling at its line and making his job at the tiller a tough one.\n Surf! he thought. I\u0027m actually seeing surf.\n Islanders had reports of this phenomenon, few of them reliable. It occurred to him that they were unreliable only because the incidents were so infrequent. The great Island of Everett, almost as large as Vashon, had reported a surf sighting just before crashing bottom in a swing-surge of Pandora\u0027s sea that left it suddenly awash in a mysterious shallows. Everett had been lost without survivors, bottomed out, thirty years back.\n The course beeper sounded.\n Twisp boxed up the driftwatcher, kicked off the warning switch and pulled the tiller hard into his belly. Now he was cutting across the great curve of current that still drifted him toward the foaming white line. The current took on a new character. It rolled and twisted along the surface, dispersing waves in its track. There was a determination about it, a feeling of purpose, as though it were a live thing remorselessly savaging anything in its way. Twisp only wanted out of it. He had never felt such a force. He notched the motor up another hundred revs. At this point a burnout seemed worth the risk - he had to shake this current.\n The coracles twisted at the rim of the surge, forcing him to fight the tiller. Then, suddenly, he was through and onto open waves. The white line of surf still lay too close but now he felt he could beat it. He cranked the motor up another notch, pushing full speed. The silver line of current grew thinner and thinner as he left it behind him. It swept in a great curve around the surfline and disappeared.\n What if the kid was caught in that? Twisp wondered. Brett could be anywhere.\n He crouched over his instruments, read the doppler on Vashon\u0027s range signal, and prepared to make a sun-sight to report the location of this danger. A red telltale blinked on his radio - another Island\u0027s signal. He rotated and homed in on it, identified it as little Eagle Island, off to the northeast. It was almost at range limit, too far away to ask for distance and a crosscheck. His depth finder had nothing in its memory circuits to match the stretch of bottom under him. Dead reckoning, the sun-sight and Vashon\u0027s doppler, however, told him the swift current had taken him at least ten klicks to the west of his intended course. The current had moved him rapidly, but the diversion meant he saved no time reaching the coordinates where the wavewall had struck Vashon.\n Twisp coded in the bearings and location, keyed the automatic transmitter and activated it. The signal went out for anyone listening: \"Dangerous shallows in this location!\"\n Presently, he scanned the water around him, squinting and shading his eyes. No sign of Mermen - not a buoy, no flag, nothing. That terrifying current had become nothing more than a silver thread glinting along the surface. He took a course reading and prepared for another hour or more of careful dead reckoning. In a moment, he knew, he would be back into that watchful waiting from which anything unusual could bring him instantly alert.\n A noisy boiling hissing and clatter came from astern, an eruption of sound that drowned out the quiet pulsing of his motor and the slap of waves against his hull.\n Twisp whirled and was just in time to see a Merman sub leap nose-first out of the water and fall back onto its side. The hard metal glittered gold and green. He had a brief glimpse of exterior tools on the sub, all in active mode, whirling and twisting like spastic limbs. The sub splashed down not a hundred meters away, sending up a great wave that swept under the coracles and carried Twisp high. He fought for steerage as he watched the sub roll, then right itself.\n Without thinking about it, Twisp swung his tiller into his gut, turning to go to the rescue. No sub did that sort of thing. The crew could be beaten half to death - particularly inside one of those all-metal Merman wonders. This crew was in trouble.\n As he came around, the sub\u0027s hatch popped open. A man wearing only green utility pants clambered out onto the hull. The conning tower already was awash, the sub nosing back under the surface. A wave swept the man from his perch. He started swimming blindly, great thrashing strokes that took him at an angle across Twisp\u0027s course. The sub vanished behind him with a great slurping air bubble.\n Twisp changed course to intercept the swimmer. Cupping his great hands around his mouth, Twisp shouted: \"This way! Over here!\"\n The swimmer did not change course.\n Twisp swung wide and pulled up alongside the man, cut the motor and extended a hand.\n Now in the coracle\u0027s shadow, the swimmer twisted his head upward and gave Twisp a frightened look, seeing the extended hand.\n \"Come aboard,\" Twisp said. It was a traditional Islander greeting, matter-of-fact. Not even an implied question, such as \"What in Ship\u0027s name are you doing out here?\"\n The swimmer took Twisp\u0027s hand and Twisp pulled him aboard, nearly swamping the coracle as the man clumsily tried to grasp a thwart. Twisp pulled him to the center and returned to the tiller.\n The man stood there a moment, looking all around, dripping a damp pool into the bilges. His bare chest and face were pale, but not as pale as most Mermen\u0027s.\n Is this a Merman who lives a lot topside? Twisp wondered. And what the hell happened to him?\n The swimmer looked older than Brett but younger than Twisp. His green utility pants were dark with seawater.\n Twisp glanced to where the sub had been. Only a slow roiling of the water showed where it had gone down.\n \"Trouble?\" Twisp asked. Again, it was the Islander way - a laconic overture that said: \"What help do you need that I can give?\"\n The man sat down and lay back against the coracle\u0027s deck cover. He drew in several deep, shuddering breaths.\n Recovering from shock, Twisp thought, studying him. The man was small and heavyset, with a large head.\n An Islander? Twisp wondered. He put it as a question, hoping directness would shock the man back to normal.\n The man remained silent, but he scowled.\n That was a reaction, anyway. Twisp took his time examining this strange figure from the sea: dark brown hair lay dripping against a wide forehead. Brown eyes returned Twisp\u0027s gaze from beneath thick brows. The man had a wide nose, wide mouth and square chin. His shoulders were broad, with powerful upper arms thinning to rather delicate forearms and slender hands. The hands appeared soft but the fingertips were calloused and shiny. Twisp had seen such fingertips on people who spent a lot of time at keyboard controls.\n Hooking a thumb back to where the sub had gone down, Twisp asked: \"You care to tell me what that was all about?\"\n \"I was escaping.\" The voice was a thin tenor.\n \"The sub\u0027s hatch was still open when it went under,\" Twisp said. That was just a comment and could be taken as such if the man desired.\n \"The rest of the sub was secured,\" the man said. \"Only the engine compartment will flood.\"\n \"That was a Merman sub,\" Twisp said; another comment.\n The man pushed himself away from the deck cover. \"We\u0027d better get out of here,\" he said.\n \"We\u0027re staying while I look for a friend,\" Twisp said. \"He was lost overboard in that last wave wall.\" He cleared his throat. \"You care to tell me your name?\"\n \"Iz Bushka.\"\n Twisp felt that he had heard that name before, but could not make the connection. And now as he looked at Bushka there was a sensation that Twisp had seen this face before - in a Vashon passage, perhaps ... somewhere.\n \"Do I know you?\" Twisp asked.\n \"What\u0027s your name?\" Bushka asked.\n \"Twisp. Queets Twisp.\"\n \"Don\u0027t think we\u0027re acquainted,\" Bushka said. He sent another fearful gaze across the water around the coracles. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-lazarus-effect-destination-void-3/page-10.html","bookId":2171,"book":{"id":2171,"title":"The Lazarus Effect (Destination: Void #3)","description":"Storyline: \n The Lazarus Effect (Destination: Void #3) \n The Histories assert that a binary system cannot support life.

That we survive at all on our fragile Clone-rafts is as much a curse as a victory. This is the time of madness. Hali Ekel, the Journals Duque smelled burning flesh and scorched hair. He sniffed, sniffed again, and whined. His one good eye watered and pained him when he tried to knuckle it open. His mother was out. Out was a word he could say, like hot and Ma. He could not precisely identify the location and shape of out.
