{"id":98900,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"Brett found he could not invade her privacy and averted his eyes. Maybe I should tell her, he thought. It\u0027s not really fair to be able to see this way and not let her know. \"I would prefer not to interfere with your life,\" he said. He heard Scudi slip under her blankets. \"You don\u0027t interfere,\" she said. \"This is one of the most exciting things that has ever happened to me. You are my friend; I like you. Is that enough?\" Brett dropped his clothes and slipped under the covers, pulling them to his neck. Queets always said you couldn\u0027t figure a Merman. Friends? \"We are friends, not so?\" she insisted. He offered his hand across the space between the beds. Realizing that she couldn\u0027t see it, he picked up hers in his own. She pressed his fingers hard, her hand warm in his. Presently, she sighed and removed her hand gently. \"I must sleep,\" she said. \"Me, too.\" Her hand lifted from the bed and found the switch on the wall. The whale sounds stopped. Brett found the room exquisitely quiet, a stillness he had not imagined possible. He felt his ears relaxing, then, an alertness ... suddenly listening for ... what? He didn\u0027t know. Sleep was necessary, though. He had to sleep. His mind said: \"Something is being done about informing your parents and Queets.\" He was alive and family and friends would be happy after their fears and sadness. Or so he hoped. After several nervous minutes, he decided the lack of motion was preventing sleep. The discovery allowed him to relax more, breathe easier. He could remember with his body the gentle rocking motion topside and thought hard about that, tricking his mind into the belief that waves still lifted and fell beneath him. \"Brett?\" Scudi\u0027s voice was little more than a whisper. \"Yes?\" \"Of all the creatures in hyb, the ones I would like most are the birds, the little birds that sing.\" \"I\u0027ve heard recordings from Ship,\" he said, his voice sleepy. \"The songs are as painfully beautiful as the whales. And they fly.\" \"We have pigeons and squawks,\" he said. \"The squawks are ducks and they do not sing,\" she said. \"But they whistle when they fly and it\u0027s fun to watch them.\" Her blankets rustled as she turned away from him. \"Good night, friend,\" she whispered. \"Sleep flat.\" \"Good night, friend,\" he answered. And there, at the edge of sleep, he imagined her beautiful smile. Is this how love begins? he wondered. There was a tightness in his chest, which did not go away until he fell into a restless sleep. The child Vata slipped into catatonia as the kelp and hylighters sickened. She has been comatose for more than three years now and, since she carries both kelp and human genes, it is hoped that she can be instrumental in restoring the kelp to sentience. Only the kelp can tame this terrible sea. - Hali Ekel, the Journals It was not so much that Ward Keel noticed the stillness as that he felt it all over his skin. Events had conspired to keep him topside throughout his long life, not that he had ever felt a keen desire to go down under. Admit it, he told himself. You were afraid because of all the stories - deprivation shock, pressure syndrome. Now, for the first time in his life there was no movement of deck under his bare feet, no nearby sounds of human activity and voices, no hiss of organic walls against organic ceilings - none of the omnipresent frictions to which Islanders adjusted as infants. It was so quiet his ears ached. Beside him in the room where Kareen Ale had left him \"to adjust for a few moments\" stood a large plazglass wall revealing a rich undersea expanse of reds, blues and washed greens. The subtlety of unfamiliar shadings held him rapt for several minutes. Ale had said: \"I will be nearby. Call if you need me.\" Mermen well knew the weaknesses of those who came down under. Awareness of all that water overhead created its own peculiar panic in some of the visitors and migrants. And being alone, even by choice, was not something Islanders tolerated well until they had adjusted to it ... slowly. A lifetime of knowing that other human beings were just on the other side of those thin organic walls, almost always within the sound of a whispered call, built up blind spots. You did not hear certain things - the sounds of lovemaking, family quarrels and sorrows. Not unless you were invited to hear them. Was Ale softening him up by leaving him alone here? Keel wondered. Could she be watching through some secret Merman device? He felt certain that Ale, with her medical background and long association with Islanders, knew the problems of a first-timer. Having watched Ale perform her diplomatic duties over the past few years, Keel knew she seldom did anything casually. She planned. He was sure she had a well-thought-out motive for leaving an Islander alone in these circumstances. The silence pressed hard upon him. A demanding thought filled his mind: Think, Ward! That\u0027s what you\u0027re supposed to be so good at. He found it alarming that the thought came to him in his dead mother\u0027s voice, touching his aural centers so sharply that he glanced around, almost fearful that he would see a ghostly shade shaking a finger of admonishment at him. He breathed deeply once, twice, and felt the constriction of his chest ease slightly. Another breath and the edge of reason returned. Silence did not ache as much nor press as heavily. During the descent by courier sub, Ale had asked him no questions and had supplied no answers. Reflecting on this, he found it odd. She was noted for hard questions to pave the way for her own arguments. Was it possible that they simply wanted him down here and away from his seat on the Committee? he wondered. Taking him as an invited guest was, after all, less stressful and dangerous than outright kidnapping. It felt odd to think of himself as a commodity with some undetermined value. Comforting, though; it meant they would probably not employ violence against him. Now, why did I think that? he wondered. He stretched his arms and legs and crossed to the couch facing the undersea view. The couch felt softly supportive under him in spite of the fact that it was of some dead material. The stiffness of age made the soft seat especially welcome. He sensed the dying remora within him still fighting to survive. Avoid anxiety, the medics told him. That was most certainly a joke in his line of work. The remora still produced vital hormones, but he remembered the warning: \"We can replace it, although the replacements won\u0027t last long. And their survival time will become shorter and shorter as new replacements are introduced. You are rejecting them, you see.\" His stomach growled. He was hungry and that he found to be a good sign. There was nothing to indicate a food preparation area in the room. No speakers or viewscreens. The ceiling sloped upward away from the couch to the view port, which appeared to be about six or seven meters high. How extravagant! he thought. Only one person in all this space. A room this size could house a large Islander family. The air was a bit cooler than he liked but his body had adjusted. The dim light through the view port cast a green wash over the floor there. Bright phosphorescence from the ceiling dominated the illumination. The room was not far under the sea\u0027s surface. He knew this from the outside light level. Plenty of water over him, though: millions of kilos. The thought of all that weight pressing in on this space brought a touch of sweat to his upper lip. He ran a damp palm over the wall behind the couch - warm and firm. He breathed easier. This was Merman space. They didn\u0027t build anything fragile. The wall was plasteel. He had never before seen so much of it. The room struck him suddenly as a fortress. The walls were dry, testimony to a sophisticated ventilation system. Mermen topside tended to keep their quarters so humid he felt smothered by the air. Except for Ale ... but she was like no other human he had ever met, Islander or Merman. The air in this room, he realized, had been adjusted for Islander comfort. That reassured him. Keel patted the couch beside him and thought of Joy, how much she would like that surface. A hedonist, Joy. He tried to picture her resting on the couch. A desire for Joy\u0027s comforting presence filled him with sudden loneliness. Abruptly, he wondered about himself. He had been mostly a loner throughout his life, only the occasional liaison. Was the proximity of death working a fearful change on him? The thought disgusted him. Why should he inflict himself on Joy, saddle her with the sorrow of a permanent parting? I am going to die soon. He wondered briefly who the Committee would elect as Chief Justice to replace him. His own choice would be Carolyn, but the political choice would be Matts. He did not envy whoever they chose. It was a thankless job. There were things to do before he made his final exit, though. He stood and steadied himself against the couch. His neck ached, as usual. His legs felt rubbery and didn\u0027t want to support him at first. That was a new symptom. The deck underfoot was hard plasteel and he was thankful that it, like the walls, was heated. He waited for strength to return, then, leaning against the wall, made his way toward the door at his left. There were two buttons beside the door. He pressed the lower one and heard a panel slide back behind the couch. He looked toward the sound and his heart shifted into triple-time. The panel had concealed a mural. He stared at it. The thing was frighteningly realistic, almost photographic. It showed a surface construction site at least half-destroyed, flames everywhere and men wriggling in the tentacles of hylighters drifting overhead. Hylighters died with the kelp, he thought. This was either an old painting or somebody\u0027s imaginative reconstruction of history. He suspected the former. The rich suns-set background, the intimate detail of hylighters - everything focused on one worker near the center who pointed a finger at the viewer. It was an accusing figure, dark-eyed and glaring. I know that place, Keel thought. How is it possible? Familiarity was stronger than the flutterings of deja vu. This was real seeing, a memory. The memory told him that somewhere in this room or nearby there was a red mandala. How do I know this? He examined the room carefully. Couch, plaz port, the mural, bare walls, an oval hatch-door. No mandala. He walked to the view port and touched it. Cool, the only cool surface in the room. How strange the fixed view port installation was - nothing like it at all on the Islands. Couldn\u0027t be. The flex of bubbly around the solid plaz would tear away the organics that sealed it and the heavy, solid material would turn into a thing of destruction during a storm. Drift watchers, mutated cornea, were safer in rough weather even if they did require care and feeding. The plaz was incredibly clear. Nothing in the feel of it suggested the extreme density and thickness. A small, heavily whiskered scrubberfish grazed the outside, cleaning the surface. Beyond the fish, a pair of Mermen came into view, jockeying a heavy sledge loaded with rocks and mud. They went past him out of sight beyond a slope to his right. Out of curiosity, Keel fisted the plaz: thump-thump. The scrubberfish continued grazing, undisturbed. Anemone and ferns, grasses and sponges waved in the current beneath the fish. Dozens of other fish, a multicolored mixed school, cleaned the surface of kelp leaves beyond the immediate growth. Larger fish poked along the soft bottom mud, stirring up puffs of gray sediment. Keel had seen this sort of thing in holos but the reality was different. Some of the fish he recognized - creatures from the labs that had been brought for judgment by the Committee before being released in the sea. A harlequin fish came up below the scrubber and nudged the plaz. Keel remembered the day the C/P had blessed the first harlequin fish before their release. It was almost like seeing an old friend. Once more, Keel turned to his examination of the room and that elusive memory. Why did it feel so damned familiar? Memory said the missing mandala should be to the right of the mural. He walked to that wall and brushed a finger along it, looking for another panel switch. Nothing, but the wall moved slightly and he heard a clicking. He peered at it. It was not plasteel but some kind of light, composite material. A faint seam ran down the middle of the wall. He put a palm against the surface to the right of the seam and pushed. The panel slid back, revealing a passage, and immediately he smelled food. He opened the panel wide and walked through. The passage made a sharp turn to the left and he saw lights. Kareen Ale stood there in a kitchen-dining area, her back to him. A rich smell of strong tea and fish broth assailed his nostrils. He drew a breath to speak but stopped as he saw the red mandala. The sight of it above Kareen\u0027s right shoulder brought a sigh from Keel. The mandala drew his consciousness into the shapes there, twisting him through circles and wedges toward the center. A single eye peered out from the center, out at the universe. It was unlidded, and rested atop a golden pyramid. These can\u0027t be my memories, he thought. It was a terrifying experience. Ship memories flitted through his mind - someone walking down a long, curved passage, a violet-lighted agrarium fanned out to his left. He felt powerless before the stream of visions. Kelp waved to him from someplace under the sea and schools of fish his Committee had never approved swam past his eyes. Ale turned and saw the enraptured expression on his face, the fixed intensity with which he stared at the mandala. \"Are you all right?\" she asked. Her voice shocked him out of the other-memories. He exhaled a trembling breath, inhaled. \"I\u0027m ... I\u0027m hungry,\" he said. There was no thought of revealing the weird memories he had just experienced. How could she understand when he did not understand? \"Why don\u0027t you sit here?\" she asked. She indicated a small table set for two at one end of the kitchen area beside a smaller plaz port. The table was low, Merman-style. His knees ached just thinking about sitting there. \"I\u0027ve cooked for you myself,\" Ale said. Noting his still bemused expression, she added: \"That hatchway in the other room leads to a head with shower and washbasin. Beyond it you\u0027ll find office facilities if you require them. The exterior hatchways are out there as well.\" He crowded his legs under the table and sat with his elbows on the surface in front of him, his hands supporting his head. Was that a dream? he wondered. The red mandala lay directly in front of him. He was almost afraid to focus on it. \"You\u0027re admiring the mandala,\" Ale said. She busied herself once more in the kitchen area. He lifted his attention and let his gaze trace the ancient lines along their mysterious pathways. Nothing drew him inward this time. Slowly, bits of his own memories crept into his mind, images flashed behind his eyes and stuttered like a crippled larynx, then caught. Awareness reached back to one of his earliest history lessons, a holo being played in the center of a classroom. It had been a docudrama for young children. Islanders loved theatricals and this one had been fascinating. He could not remember the title, but he did recall that it dealt with the last days of Pandora\u0027s continents - they didn\u0027t look small at all in the holos - and the death of the kelp. That had been the first time Keel had heard the kelp called \"Avata.\" Behind the holo figures playing out the drama in a command post there had been a wall ... and that frightening mural from the outer room. Nearby, as the holo shifted its focus, there had been the red mandala, just as he saw it now. Keel did not want to think how long ago he had watched the drama - more than seventy years, anyway. He returned his attention to Ale. \"Is that the original mandala or a copy?\" he asked. \"I\u0027m told it\u0027s the original. It\u0027s very old, older than any settlement on Pandora. You seem taken by it.\" \"I\u0027ve seen it and the mural out there before,\" he said. \"These walls and the kitchen area are more recent, aren\u0027t they?\" \"The space was remodeled for my convenience,\" she said. \"I\u0027ve always been drawn to these rooms. The mandala and mural are where they\u0027ve always been. And they\u0027re cared for.\" \"Then I know where I am,\" he said. \"Islander children learn history through holodramas and ...\" \"I know that one,\" she said. \"Yes, this is part of the old Redoubt. Once it stood completely out of the sea, with some fine mountains behind it, I understand.\" She brought food to the table on a tray and set out the bowls and chopsticks. \"Wasn\u0027t most of the Redoubt destroyed?\" he asked. \"The documentary holos were supposed to be reconstructions of a few from before ...\" \"Whole sections survived intact,\" she said. \"Automatic latches closed and sealed off much of the Redoubt. We restored it very carefully.\" \"I\u0027m impressed.\" He nodded, reassessing the probable importance of Kareen Ale. Mermen had remodeled a part of the old Redoubt for her convenience. She lived casually in a museum, apparently immune to the historical value of the objects and building surrounding her. He had never before met a Merman in a Merman environment, and he now recognized this blank spot in his experience as a weakness. Keel forced himself to relax. For a dying man, there were advantages to being here. He didn\u0027t have to decide life and death for new life. No pleading mothers and raging fathers would confront him with creatures who could not pass Committee. This was a world away from the Islands. Ale sipped her tea. It smelled of mint and suddenly reignited Keel\u0027s hunger. He began to eat, Islander-style, setting aside equal portions for his host. The first taste of the fish broth convinced him that it was the richest and most delicately spiced broth he\u0027d ever shared. Was this the general diet for Mermen? He cursed his lack of down-under experience. Keel noticed that Ale enjoyed her own helping of the steaming soup and felt insulted at first. Another cultural thing, he realized. He marveled that a simple difference in table manners could need translation to avoid international disaster. Unanswered questions still buzzed in his head. Perhaps a more devious approach was indicated - a mixture of Merman directness with Islander obliqueness. \"It\u0027s pleasantly dry in these quarters,\" he said, \"but you don\u0027t need a sponge. You don\u0027t oil your skin. I\u0027ve often wondered how you get by in a topside environment?\" She dropped her gaze from his face and held her teacup to her lips with both hands. Hiding, he thought. \"Ward, you are a very strange person,\" she said as she lowered the cup. \"That is not the question I expected.\" \"What question did you expect?\" \"I prefer to discuss my immunity from the need for a sponge. You see, we have quarters down under that are kept with a topside environment. I was raised in such quarters. I\u0027m acclimated to Islander conditions. And I adapt very quickly to the humidity down under - when I have to.\" \"You were chosen as an infant for topside duty?\" There was hesitation and shock in his voice. \"I was chosen then for my present position,\" she said. \"A number of us were ... set aside in the possibility that some of us would meet the mental and physical requirements.\" Keel stared at her, astonished. He had never heard of such a cold dismissal of someone\u0027s entire life. Ale had not chosen her own life! And, unlike most Islanders, she had a body that in no way restricted her from any trade she chose. He remembered suddenly how she planned everything - a planned person who planned. Ale had been ... distorted. She probably saw it as training, but training was just an acceptable distortion. \"But you do live a ... a Merman life?\" he asked. \"You follow their customs, you swim and ...\" \"Look.\" She unfastened her tunic at the neck and dropped the top of it, turning her breasts away from him to expose the shoulders. Her back was as clear-skinned and pale as weathered bone. At the top of her shoulder blades the skin had been pinched into a short strip of ridge adjacent to the spine. There she carried the clear pucker-mark of an airfish, but in a peculiar place. He caught the meaning immediately. \"If that mark were on your neck, Islanders might be distracted when they met you, right?\" It occurred to him that she would have undergone major arterial reshifting to carry this off - a complicated surgery. \"You have beautiful skin,\" he added, \"it\u0027s a shame they marked it up that way at all.\" \"It was done when I was very young,\" she said. \"I hardly think about it anymore. It\u0027s just a ... convenience.\" He resisted the urge to stroke her shoulder, her smooth strong back. Careful, you old fool! he told himself. She restored the top of her garment and when her gaze met his, he realized that he had been staring. \"You\u0027re very beautiful, Kareen,\" he said. \"In the old holos, all humans look ... something like you, but you\u0027re ...\" He shrugged, feeling the exceptional presence of his appliance against his neck and shoulders. \"Forgive an old Mute,\" he added, \"but I\u0027ve always thought of you as the ideal.\" She turned a puzzled frown on him. \"I\u0027ve never before heard an Islander call himself a ... a Mute. Is that how you think of yourself?\" \"Not really. But a lot of Islanders use the term. Joking, mostly, but sometimes a mother will use it to get a youngster\u0027s attention. Like: \u0027Mute, get your grubby little paws outa that frosting.\u0027 Or: \u0027You go for that deal, my man, and you\u0027re one dumb Mute.\u0027 Somehow, when it comes from one of us it\u0027s all right. When it comes from a Merman - it strikes deeper than I can describe. Isn\u0027t that what you call us among yourselves, \u0027Mutes\u0027?\" \"Boorish Mermen might, and ... well, it\u0027s a rather common bit of slang in some company. Personally, I don\u0027t like the word. If a distinction has to be made, I prefer \u0027Clone,\u0027 or \u0027Lon,\u0027 as our ancestors did. Perhaps my quarters give me a penchant for antiquated words.\" \"So you\u0027ve never referred to us as \u0027Mutes\u0027 yourself.\" A rosy blush crept up her neck and over her face. He found it most attractive, but the response told him her answer. She put a smooth, tanned hand over his wrinkled and liver-spotted fingers. \"Ward, you must understand that one trained as a diplomat ... I mean, in some company ...\" \"When on the Islands, do as the Islanders do.\" She removed her hand. The back of his own cooled in disappointment. \"Something like that,\" she said. She picked up her teacup and swirled the dregs. Keel saw the defensiveness in the gesture. Ale was somehow off-balance. He\u0027d never seen her that way before, and he wasn\u0027t vain enough to attribute it to this exchange with her. Keel believed that the only thing that could bother Ale was something totally unplanned, something with no body of knowledge behind it, no diplomatic precedent. Something out of her control. \"Ward,\" she said, \"I think there is one point that you and I have always agreed on.\" She kept her attention on the teacup. \"We have?\" He held his tone neutral, not giving her any help. \"Human has less to do with anatomy than with a state of mind,\" she said. \"Intelligence, compassion ... humor, the need to share ...\" \"And build hierarchies?\" he asked. \"I guess that, too.\" She met his gaze. \"Mermen are very vain about their bodies. We\u0027re proud that we\u0027ve stayed close to the original norm.\" \"Is that why you showed me the scar on your back?\" \"I wanted you to see that I\u0027m not perfect.\" \"That you\u0027re deformed, like me?\" \"You\u0027re not making this very easy for me, Ward.\" \"You, or yours, have the luxury of choice in their mutations. Genetics, of course, adds a particularly bitter edge to the whole thing. Your scar is not ... \u0027like me,\u0027 but one of your freckles is. Your freckles have a much more pleasant quality to them than this.\" He tapped the neck support. \"But I\u0027m not complaining,\" he assured her, \"just being pedantic. Now what is it that I\u0027m not making easy for you?\" Keel sat back, pleased for once about those tedious years behind the bench and some of the lessons those years had taught him. She stared into his eyes, and he saw fear in her expression. \"There are Mermen fanatics who want to wipe every ... Mute off the face of this planet.\" The flat abruptness of her statement, the matter-of-fact tone caught him off guard. Lives were precious to Islanders and Mermen, this he\u0027d witnessed for himself innumerable times during his many years. The idea of deliberate killing nauseated him, as it did most Pandorans. His own judgments against lethal deviants had brought him much isolation in his lifetime, but the law required that someone pass judgment on people, blobs and ... things ... He could never decree termination without suffering acute personal agony. But to wipe out hundreds of hundreds of thousands ... He returned Ale\u0027s stare, thinking about her recent behavior - the food cooked by her own hands, the sharing of these remarkable quarters. And, of course, the scar. I\u0027m on your side, she was trying to say. He felt the planning behind her actions, but there was more to it, he thought, than callous outlines and assignments. Otherwise, why had she been embarrassed? She was trying to win him over to some personal viewpoint. What viewpoint? \"Why?\" he asked. She drew in a deep breath. The simplicity of his response obviously surprised her. \"Ignorance,\" she said. \"And how does this ignorance manifest itself?\" Her nervous fingers flip-flip-flipped the corner of her napkin. Her eyes sought out a stain on the tabletop and fixed themselves there. \"I am a child before you,\" Keel said. \"Explain this to me. \u0027Wipe every Mute off the face of this planet.\u0027 You know how I feel about the preservation of human life.\" \"As I feel, Ward. Believe me, please.\" \"Then explain it to this child and we can get started defeating it: Why would someone wish death to so many of us just because we\u0027re ... extranormal?\" He had never been quite so conscious of his smear of a nose, the eyes set so wide on his temples that his ears picked up the fine liquid click-click of every blink. \"It\u0027s political,\" she said. \"There\u0027s power in appealing to base responses. And there are problems over the kelp situation.\" \"What kelp situation?\" His voice sounded toneless in his own ears, far away and ... yes, afraid. Wipe every Mute off the face of this planet. \"Do you feel up to a tour?\" she asked. She glanced at the plaz beside them. Ward looked out at the undersea view. \"Out there?\" \"No,\" she said, \"not out there. There\u0027s been a wavewall topside and we\u0027ve got all our crews reclaiming some ground we\u0027ve lost.\" His eyes strained to focus forward on her mouth. Somehow, he didn\u0027t believe anyone\u0027s mouth could be so casual about a wavewall. \"The Islands?\" He swallowed. \"How bad was the damage?\" \"Minimal, Ward. To our knowledge, no fatalities. Wave-walls may very well be a thing of the past.\" \"I don\u0027t understand.\" \"This wavewall was smaller than many of the winter storms you survive every year. We\u0027ve built a series of networks of exposed land. Land above the sea. Someday, they will be islands ... real islands fixed to the planet, not drifting willy-nilly. And some of them, I think, will be continents.\" Land, he thought, and his stomach lurched. Land means shallows. An Island could bottom out in shallow water. An ultimate disaster, in the vernacular of historians, but she was talking about voluntarily increasing the risk of an Islander\u0027s worst fear. \"How much exposed land?\" he asked, trying to maintain a level tone. \"Not very much, but it\u0027s a beginning.\" \"But it would take forever to ...\" \"A long time, Ward, but not forever. We\u0027ve been at it for generations. And lately we\u0027ve had some help. It\u0027s getting done in our lifetime, doesn\u0027t that excite you?\" \"What does this have to do with the kelp?\" He felt the need to resist her obvious attempts to mesmerize him. \"The kelp is the key,\" she said, \"just as people - Islanders and Mermen - have said all along. With the kelp and a few well-placed artificial barriers, we can control the sea currents. All of them.\" Control, he thought. That\u0027s the Merman way of it. He doubted they could control the seas, but if they could manipulate currents, they could manipulate Island movement. How much control? he wondered* \"We\u0027re in a two-sun system,\" he said. \"The gravitational distortions guarantee wavewalls, earthquakes ...\" \"Not when the kelp was in its prime, Ward. And now there\u0027s enough of it to make a difference. You\u0027ll see. And currents should begin an aggrading action now - dropping sediment - rather than degrading.\" Degrading, he thought. He looked at Ale\u0027s beauty. Did she even know the meaning of the word? A technical understanding, an engineering approach was not enough. Mistaking the reason of his silence, Ale plunged on. \"We have records of everything. From the first. We can play the whole reconstruction of this planet from the beginning - the death of the kelp, everything.\" Not everything, he thought. He looked once more at the wondrous garden beyond the plaz. Growth there was so lush that the bottom could only be glimpsed in a few places. He could see no rock. As a child, he had given up watching drift because all he ever saw was rock ... and silt. When it was clear enough or shallow enough to see at all. Seeing the bottom from an Island had a way of running an icy hand down your back. \"How close are these \u0027artificial barriers\u0027 to the surface?\" he asked. She cleared her throat, avoiding his eyes. \"Along this section,\" she said, \"surflines are beginning to show. I expect watchers on Vashon already have seen them. That wavewall drifted them pretty close to ...\" \"Vashon draws a hundred meters at Center,\" he protested. \"Two-thirds of the population live below the waterline - almost half a million lives! How can you speak so casually about endangering that many ... ?\" \"Ward!\" A chill edged her voice. \"We are aware of the dangers to your Islands and we\u0027ve taken that into account. We\u0027re not murderers. We are on the verge of complete restoration of the kelp and the development of land masses - two monumental projects that we\u0027ve pursued for generations.\" \"Projects whose dangers you did not share with nor reveal to the Islanders. Are we to be sacrificed to your -\" \"No one is to be sacrificed!\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-lazarus-effect-destination-void-3/page-9.html","bookId":2171,"book":{"id":2171,"title":"The Lazarus Effect (Destination: Void #3)","description":"Storyline: The Lazarus Effect (Destination: Void #3) The Histories assert that a binary system cannot support life.
