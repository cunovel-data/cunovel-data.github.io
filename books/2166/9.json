{"id":97981,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"Ashby released her as he strode swiftly across the room. Broken pieces of furniture were stacked in the corner, buried beneath years of dust and sand. Dismay filled her as her gaze drifted slowly down. Their shoes left footprints in the sand; no matter how silent they were there was no hiding. \"Ashby.\" He turned to her, placing a finger against his lips as his eyes narrowed into a glare. Impatience filled her as she pointed angrily at their feet and then the trail of prints they had left behind. Apparently being banished to a tree house for the past hundred years had dulled Ashby\u0027s senses as it took him a few seconds to understand what she was trying to convey. His mouth dropped at the same time the knob began to rattle. Aria lurched forward, thrusting her weight against the door as it started to creak open. It slammed back closed. There was a hushed moment of silence and then excited grunts and squeals began to issue from the other side. Ashby was instantly beside her, his body weight shoved against the door as the creatures began to push and pound eagerly upon it. Between the two of them one was easy to take care of, Ashby could do it himself, but judging by the sounds, and the force with which they pushed against the door, there were at least three out there. Her fingers itched for her bow as a crack appeared at the top of the door. It was old, it would not hold against the force of these creatures. Aria\u0027s gaze fell to the pile in the corner, but even if they stacked it against the door it would do little good. Then, she spotted the window. \"Stay here.\" \"What!?\" he gasped, struggling to keep the door closed when she released it suddenly. \"Aria! Arianna!\" She didn\u0027t hesitate as she raced across the room, grasped hold of the windowsill and plunged onto the porch roof. It creaked beneath her weight, and for a moment she hesitated, uncertain if the old wood would support her. It wouldn\u0027t do either of them any good if the thing collapsed beneath her. It groaned again but held steady beneath her weight. Using her arms, she was able to maintain her balance on the steep pitch of the roof as she hurried to the back of the house. She heard something beneath her and looked down to find two more creatures following her movements, eagerly jumping up and down as they waited for her to fall. Reaching the backside of the house she plunged into another broken window. She was in another room which had a broken shower. She gave little thought to her favorite contraption as she pulled the bow from her back. Knocking two arrows against it, she used the tip of one to nudge the door open. She was able to stick her head out enough to see that there were four of them down the hall, beating on the door, pushing and shoving and grunting eagerly as they jumped on top of each other in an attempt to be the first one in. They would turn on each other if given the chance. She turned the bow sideways, she had no clear shot at any of their hearts, and with two arrows she was unlikely to hit the heart anyway. But at least she would impair two of them, and perhaps the scent of blood would help them turn on each other. Aria used her elbow to open the door the rest of the way. Four heads snapped toward her as she stepped into the hall, took aim and fired. A squeal erupted from one of the creatures as it stumbled back, an arrow imbedded firmly in its throat. Another one was brought to its knees by the arrow in its shin. Blood spurted forth but the other two did not go after their fallen brethren like she\u0027d hoped. Instead, they focused more intently upon her; their eager eyes were like glistening rubies, their fangs hung over their lower lips as one of them shoved aside the creature she\u0027d shot in the neck. Aria swiftly pulled two more arrows and fired them rapidly. One was caught in the upper arm, it didn\u0027t slow him even a little, the other arrow slammed uselessly into the wall. It quivered there for a moment, a trembling reminder of her error. Aria took a step back, needing to put more distance between them if she was going to get off another round. They raced at her as she fired. This time she hit them both, one was a deathblow that sent the creature scrambling back, howling in pain as it thrashed upon the floor. The other one was nicked in the ear, it didn\u0027t even recoil as it launched at her with clawed fingers and an eager hiss. She barely had time to toss her bow aside and grab hold of her stake before it was upon her. She fell back, bouncing across the sand as they skidded into a wall. The breath was knocked from her, stars burst before her eyes as her head crashed against the wall. Struggling to remain conscious, she managed to get her hands up between them as the thing lurched forward. It snapped at her, just inches from her face. It was strong, far stronger than her, and she could already feel the weakening in her arms as it lunged at her again. Her fingers scrambled over the stake as she tried to twist it into an angle that would be beneficial for her. It was nearly impossible as the thing clawed eagerly in its excitement and bloodlust. Adrenaline surged forth; her survival instinct took hold of her, giving her a strength that enabled her to get the stake fully twisted around. The creature\u0027s lurching momentum drove it into the sharp weapon. Its scream pierced her eardrums, blowing her hair back as it wailed in agony. She turned away, horror filling her as it began to convulse before finally falling away from her. She couldn\u0027t move, her back was pressed against the wall as her fingers curled into the thick sand. As it went still, behind the revulsion and terror a strange sense of exhilaration surged through her. She had just beaten a vampire in hand to hand combat. Granted it had been an emaciated, weakened vampire but she had still defeated it, and she was alive. She pushed herself up on the wall as Ashby yanked the arrow from the throat of the other one she had shot and drove it into the creature\u0027s chest. He shoved the thing away and Aria was able to see that he had already dispatched the other one. Ashby\u0027s gaze came slowly to her, his eyes were red, and blood marred his right cheek. \"You ok?\" Aria managed a small nod. \"Yeah.\" He wiped the blood from his face, shaking his head as he surveyed the damage around him. \"Impressive, but let\u0027s not tell Braith about this.\" A low laugh escaped her; she sat up straighter against the wall. She was about to agree when a growl from her left froze the words in her throat. \"Too late.\" The color drained from Ashby\u0027s face as he took a step back. The hair rose on the nape of her neck as she slowly turned toward the stairs. She could practically feel the fury radiating off of him as her eyes latched onto Braith\u0027s. He was imposing; his broad shoulders took up most of the stairwell. He was coated in blood. It stained his shirt and pants, streaked through his hair and was splattered across his face. Aria was immobile, terrified by what she sensed inside of him. She knew he was wild and hot-tempered, but now he seemed utterly savage. His glasses were in place, but even behind the dark lenses she could see the shadowed hue of his crimson colored eyes. Xavier stood just behind him staring at her in wonder. Behind Xavier she could see William and then Gideon as he fought to shove his way past her brother. It was the alarm on Gideon\u0027s features that drove her to her feet. Unfortunately, she forgot about the blow to her head and became somewhat dizzy as she rose. She took a staggering step before falling against the wall. Ashby retreated further as Braith came out of the stairwell. She didn\u0027t blame Ashby, she\u0027d never been afraid of Braith before, was certain he would never harm her, but in this moment he was terrifying in his anger. That fury was not directed at her, but it was explosive and it was looking for a release. Aria pushed herself off of the wall as Gideon reached Xavier. Gideon\u0027s eyes found hers as he rested his hand against Xavier\u0027s shoulder. Xavier wasn\u0027t moving though, he was too focused on the events unfolding in front of him. \"I\u0027m fine Braith.\" His jaw clenched and unclenched, the red of his eyes deepened. Aria gulped as she held her hands up before her. \"See, I\u0027m fine.\" \"You\u0027re bleeding.\" The words were grated behind his clenched teeth. She\u0027d forgotten about the broken glass. \"It\u0027s from the windows Braith. I didn\u0027t realize there was glass still in them.\" It didn\u0027t seem to matter though as his head twisted slowly toward Ashby. He was like a wolf stalking its prey as his nostrils flared. Ashby took another step back as Braith came further into the hall. He was only two feet away from her now, but the distance seemed far more immense and she was scared she wouldn\u0027t be able to cross it in order to reach him in time. What was wrong with him? She didn\u0027t know the answer to that but it seemed as if he was directing everything at Ashby. \"You had one job, one thing to do.\" Ashby took another step back as Braith honed in on him. Panic filled her as she realized he was going to attack Ashby. It didn\u0027t matter that she was fine, that they had succeeded in killing four of them. \"All you had to do was make sure she stayed safe.\" Aria shoved off the wall. If Braith rushed Ashby, there would be no stopping him. Xavier had taken a step into the hall to watch what was about to unfold. Gideon tried to get past him but Xavier thrust out his arm, blocking his approach. \"I want to see what happens,\" he murmured. Aria was confused by the vampire\u0027s words. Gideon looked as if he was going to protest but remained silent as he took a step away. William was ashen, he too tried to get past them but Xavier and Gideon blocked his attempt. Weren\u0027t they going to help her? At least help Ashby? She didn\u0027t have time to contemplate the answer as Braith continued to prowl toward Ashby. Melinda! She barely knew Braith\u0027s younger sister, but she\u0027d felt a bond with the proud, beautiful woman. If Ashby was destroyed, then Melinda would be also. Plus, she\u0027d kind of grown attached to the cocky vampire who was currently backed into the corner at the end of the hall. Scrambling forward, Aria threw herself in front of Braith, flinging her arms wide as she strained to get air into her suddenly constricted and panicked chest. \"I\u0027m fine!\" she wheezed. \"Look at me Braith. Look at me!\" It seemed like forever before those red eyes shifted toward her. There was no softening in them though, no acknowledgement of her words. Without thinking, she ripped the bandages from her hands to reveal the shallow cuts that had only slightly bled. His eyes flared even brighter as they latched onto the drops of blood glistening on her skin. Was he hungry? Was that the problem? No, this was something more. He was caught up in something, and for the first time ever she wasn\u0027t sure that she would be enough for him. \"Braith.\" It was a low plea, a desperate whisper. He grabbed hold of her arms as she reached for him. His body was rigid, his muscles locked but his grip was surprisingly gentle. She hoped for a moment that he had come to his senses, but then he was moving her out of the way. \"Braith, wait.\" Aria strained in his grasp trying to get him to snap out of whatever had him ensnared. Her fingers shoved aside the sleeves of his shirt, she needed to feel his skin; she hoped the contact would bring him back to her but it didn\u0027t seem to be helping. \"Here,\" she breathed fervently. Grabbing hold of his hand she pressed it against her chest, over the spot where her heart beat. She had no idea what she was doing. \"Here Braith, feel, I\u0027m fine.\" Recognition seemed to shimmer through him, there was a wavering, a softening that sparked some hope inside of her. His fingers splayed against her, they twitched faintly and then curled into her shirt, into her flesh. Pulling her against him, his forehead fell to hers. Relief flowed through her; she clutched his hand as air rushed into her empty lungs. \"Alive,\" he breathed. \"Yes, of course.\" Then, before she knew what he was doing, he wrapped his hand around the back of her neck and pulled her close. His mouth was in the hollow of her throat, his lips pressed against his marks on her skin. Aria went completely still, she would give him whatever he needed, but she sensed more behind this. She sensed something dark and desperate as his lips pulled back. A shiver worked through her as his fangs skimmed over her flesh, pressing against her. His arm latched around her waist, dragging her against him, pressing her body flush to his. Her heart leapt wildly as she waited for his bite. She yearned for this so badly, perhaps even more so than him. Her fingers curled into his back, she forgot about the others within the hall, she didn\u0027t care about them anymore. She was too swept up in him, too caught up in the teasing pressure of his fangs. And then, just when she thought she might scream from the longing building within her, he finally bit deep. A gasp, more of pleasure than pain escaped her. Her fingers curled into his hair, she held him tighter against her as she felt the tantalizing pull of her blood in deep, slow waves. Her head fell against him, she clung to him as beyond the concern for her safety, the pleasure her blood gave him ensnared them both. She had just started to lose herself to him when he severed the bond between them. She felt the loss acutely as he cradled her against him. \"You terrify me,\" he breathed. She managed a small laugh. \"The feeling\u0027s mutual.\" She realized she\u0027d said the wrong thing as he stiffened against her. \"I would never harm you Aria,\" he grated. She was not surprised to discover that they were alone in the hall; Ashby had been smart to use Braith\u0027s distraction as a chance to escape... so had the others. \"I know that.\" She ran her fingers over the firm planes of his face as she pulled the glasses away and dropped them into the sand. \"I know you would never hurt me,\" she assured him. \"But Ashby, what was that? What were you thinking? You were going to kill him.\" He opened his mouth; she thought perhaps to protest her statement. Instead he closed it again and tenderly rested his fingers over the fresh marks he\u0027d left on her neck. \"I would have, yes,\" he admitted. She was not taken aback by the admission. \"Why?\" He shook his head; his eyebrows drew together as a brief look of confusion crossed his face. \"I don\u0027t know.\" She knew it killed him to admit that, but there was no denying it. \"I saw you, on that roof, bleeding. I thought you were going to die. I left you with him, to protect you, and...\" His voice broke off. Aria stroked him, looking to calm him as his distraught eyes met hers. There was so much anguish and confusion in his gaze that it robbed her breath. \"I just lost it.\" He hated acknowledging any weakness, and that\u0027s just what she was, a weakness that he couldn\u0027t keep completely protected no matter how much he tried. And no matter how strong or how fast or how capable she was, she was also a mortal. She had a lifespan clock that she suddenly heard ticking very loudly within her chest. \"There\u0027s so much risk for you here. I shouldn\u0027t have left you, but I trusted Ashby to take care of you...\" \"It wasn\u0027t his fault Braith, he did protect me.\" \"You were on the roof Arianna.\" She forced a smile, hoping to ease him in some way. \"It\u0027s not that different than a tree, little more of a pitch, little less bark but still wood.\" He wasn\u0027t amused. \"You could have broken your neck.\" She quirked an eyebrow at him. \"Hardly,\" she snorted. \"That wood is over a hundred years old...\" \"I know where to put my feet,\" she interrupted sharply not at all phased by the irritated look he shot her. \"You have to stop treating me like I\u0027m incapable. I may not be as strong as you, I may not be immortal, but I am far more capable than most of taking care of myself. I just beat a vampire in hand to hand combat. No one does that Braith, no one. And you shouldn\u0027t talk; you left me in the dark about your suspicions for you out there! You put yourself at risk also!\" His jaw worked as his teeth ground. She was braced for a fight. She was not braced for the brush of his lips against hers, or the surge of heat that pooled in her belly, causing a small sigh to escape. \"I need Ashby, Jack, and Gideon, and yes I trust Gideon enough to trust him with you, to help protect you. When they fail...\" \"Ashby didn\u0027t fail. We were ambushed Braith, there was no way for anyone to know that they would sneak up behind us like that. He saved me.\" \"I\u0027d say you saved him,\" he retorted. Aria smiled as she poked him in his rigid stomach. \"Who knew that I, of all people, would have a habit of saving vampires?\" She was finally able to coax a smile from him, one that melted her heart and caused her own grin to expand. It was so rare that he smiled. It lit his flawed eyes and eased the hard angles of his face. If the smile were big enough, every once in a while a dimple would appear. She was the only one that ever got to see him like this, relaxed, almost vulnerable, and oh so wonderfully, almost trouble-free. \"Certainly not me.\" \"I didn\u0027t think so.\" She was saddened when his smile faded and his face became tense again. One day, she vowed, one day he\u0027ll smile more often. She\u0027d make sure of it. And he\u0027d laugh, at least once a day, preferably more. \"Is it always going to be like this Braith? Ashby said you were volatile, I told him no, but he was right wasn\u0027t he?\" \"I think he is.\" She peered up at him, hoping he would say more but he remained silent. \"Because of me?\" \"No.\" He frowned, shaking his head. \"Well, yes, but it\u0027s not like you think Arianna.\" He grasped hold of her hands, pressing them flat to his chest. \"Here, my heart may not beat but it\u0027s there, I\u0027m aware of it now because of you. I can\u0027t stand the thought of losing you, it just...\" He broke off as his gaze drifted to the window at the end of the hall. \"I would die for you and not think twice about it. I won\u0027t, I can\u0027t, risk losing you. I need you to stay with me.\" She was awed by his words. \"Of course I will.\" \"Alive Arianna, I need you alive and there are so many things against you staying that way.\" \"If I became a vampire...\" He stiffened so suddenly that she stopped speaking mid-sentence. \"No.\" \"But...\" \"I said no. It\u0027s too much of a risk, I won\u0027t take it.\" He went to turn away from her, but she grasped hold of his arm. \"Braith, I\u0027ll die no matter what.\" He flinched as pain flickered through his eyes. \"Most humans do not survive the change.\" \"But some do,\" she pushed. He ran a hand through his thick hair in aggravation. \"Yes, of course, some do.\" \"What makes them different?\" He shrugged and took hold of her hand. His thumb ran leisurely over the back of her knuckles, causing shivers of delight to run up and down her spine. She didn\u0027t think he was aware of the effect he was having on her though as he seemed distant and remote. \"I don\u0027t know. No one really does. Perhaps it\u0027s just sheer strength.\" \"Strength?\" she prodded when he didn\u0027t continue. He shook his head; his eyes finally seemed to focus on her again. \"It\u0027s extremely painful for a human Aria. I\u0027ve only seen it occur once and the man did not survive it. I won\u0027t put you through it.\" \"Who did you see it happen to?\" He waved a hand absently. \"Some young peasant that a vampire was playing with. It was years ago, before we had even taken control.\" Aria swallowed heavily. \"But there is a chance...\" \"No.\" \"I\u0027m strong Braith, stronger than most. I can handle pain...\" \"This is more than just pain, this is death.\" \"Better than most people,\" she continued as if he hadn\u0027t spoken. \"Your insides twist into something different, your heart ceases to beat; your body goes into rigor mortis...\" \"I\u0027m stronger than most people! I just beat a vampire in hand to hand combat. I can survive this.\" \"You won\u0027t have the chance to find out.\" Aria sputtered as indignation filled her. His stubbornness was truly beginning to grate on her nerves. \"If Saul can survive...\" \"Saul?\" he asked in surprise. She folded her arms over her chest and began to tap her foot. \"Yes, Saul. I assume he was once human, he\u0027s older.\" Braith\u0027s full lips quirked in a small smile. \"Saul was never human.\" \"I don\u0027t understand. He has gray hair, wrinkles. Do you eventually age?\" His thumb stopped stroking her skin, his hand turned in hers as he held her. His gaze was focused on her hand for a moment. He was studying it as if he had never seen it before. Aria leaned forward to peer up at him, surprised by the distant look on his face. He moved her fingers apart, slowly tracing the bones of each one. \"Braith,\" she whispered, fighting against the reaction her body had to his tender touch. \"No, we don\u0027t age,\" he finally stated. \"At some time in our twenties we reach maturity, and we stop aging. I was twenty two when it happened. For some reason, Saul didn\u0027t stop aging until he was almost fifty. It\u0027s happened before, rarely, but it has occurred.\" Aria\u0027s mouth parted on a small breath, what a strange and oddly fascinating bit of information. She never would have suspected that such a thing could occur. \"Has there ever been one that has just never stopped aging and died?\" Braith shrugged, his hands moved slowly up her arms as he pulled her a step closer to him. \"It\u0027s a possibility, there were some before me,\" he said with a teasing smile that melted her heart. \"I suppose it could have happened then, but since I\u0027ve been alive I\u0027ve never heard of it. One aged until he was almost seventy before stopping, but that\u0027s the oldest I know of.\" \"How is that possible?\" \"Do you know the legend of the vampire race?\" She shook her head no. \"Have you heard of God?\" She frowned, confused by the question. \"I\u0027ve heard of him, it, her? Some of the people in the woods would talk of God, they even had ceremonies, but most didn\u0027t really understand what it was.\" \"That\u0027s one thing that hasn\u0027t changed in a hundred years.\" Dry humor that seemed oddly out of place tinted his voice. \"Was it supposed to?\" \"No.\" \"Then what does this God have to do with anything?\" \"It\u0027s said that God created the first man, humans, in his image. God also created angels to serve him, and to protect and guide the human race, but between the two, man was God\u0027s favorite. One such angel, Lucifer, was cast out of heaven because he didn\u0027t want to play second fiddle. It is said that on his way to Hell, in order to punish God, and inflict pain and fear amongst the human race, that Lucifer also created something in his own image to walk the earth. A demon that looked like man but had the vast power of the angel\u0027s, and fed upon man. He created the first vampire.\" \"Your speed and strength,\" she muttered. \"Yes, our immortality, our thirst for blood is all said to be tied to the demon that Lucifer became. The quirks that sometimes affect our race are supposedly because there is also man within us.\" Aria\u0027s head was spinning. \"You believe this?\" He shrugged absently. \"It\u0027s what has been told over the years, but I don\u0027t know for certain, no one does.\" \"And if you change me, you believe I will become a demon or the demon is what will kill me?\" \"You already are a little demon.\" He chuckled at the stern look she shot him. \"But no, I don\u0027t believe that. I believe that the loss of your blood, and the sudden influx of mine, is what will kill you. I believe the trauma to your system, the changing of your system into ours is what will kill you, but I do not believe you will become a demon, or become infected by one. Most of us are colder and more callous than humans, we feel things more acutely, our needs are more intense, but we control our actions and we are not ruled by some demon inside us. It is why Ashby loves Melinda, why my mother died for Melinda, why Gideon has established a system of equality. It\u0027s why I love you. If we were ruled by a demon none of that would be possible. Some of us seem to relate more to their angel or human side, and some to the demon one though.\" \"I see.\" Though she was fascinated by what he was telling her, she was barely paying attention to the conversation anymore as his hands clasped hold of her face and he kissed her lightly.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/refugee-the-captive-3/page-9.html","bookId":2166,"book":{"id":2166,"title":"Refugee (The Captive #3)","description":"Storyline: Refugee (The Captive #3) Whispers, rumors, and horror stories abound about The Barrens and the strange creatures that lurk within them.
