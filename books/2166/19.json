Braith spoke with a commanding, self assured tone to the group that would soon become an army. The cave was unnervingly silent considering the amount of bodies it now housed as they listened raptly to him. He laid out his plans, speaking of his new government with such passion that it brought tears to her eyes. Gideon had said that the king had a way of making people believe him, Braith seemed to have inherited that charismatic ability too as he roused the crowd, garnering cheers from them as well as devoted agreement for the cause. He encouraged and excited his army in preparation for the coming war. She refused to look at Jack. She could feel his eyes from across the cave as she slid further into the tunnel behind her. She was proud of Braith, so proud in fact that she could barely breathe through the emotion rippling through her. That same pride was at war with the feeling of being trapped that she constantly felt now. She turned away, needing some time to herself. She moved slowly through the dark cave, navigating the turns with ease. She started to run faster and faster, pounding through the dark tunnels as she was consumed with the need to be free. Her lungs were burning and her legs were tired but she continued to run toward the promise of fresh air. She burst free, nearly falling to the ground as she inhaled heaping gulps of air. She made it to a tree, collapsing against its trunk as she slid silently to the ground. She drew her knees against her chest and hugged them. Shadows from the tree limbs played over the ground, the crickets chirruped and the frogs called to each other. What were usually soothing sounds, now offered her nothing. She saw the figures emerging from the cave before they stepped into the moonlight. Having spent her entire life with them she\u0027d know Daniels\u0027s assured gate and William\u0027s slight swagger anywhere. She also recognized the sadness that rounded both their shoulders in much the same way. They sat on each side of her and leaned against the tree. \"They really admire him,\" Daniel said after a period of silence. \"They do,\" she agreed. \"Jack spoke with us,\" William told her. \"I figured he would.\" William\u0027s hand wrapped around hers, he squeezed it briefly before releasing her. \"I understand where Jack is coming from. The vampire race, even if we are finally all united, is far different from ours, but you\u0027re a strong person Aria, they may accept you.\" \"Do you honestly believe that?\" He started to respond and then shook his head. She knew he wanted to make her feel better, wanted to give her flowery promises, maybe even wanted to believe them himself, but he wouldn\u0027t lie to her. \"No.\" \"I didn\u0027t think so.\" \"I was on board with this. I thought it was better if you were separated anyway.\" Daniel squeezed her shoulder as she glared at him. \"You\u0027re seventeen years old Aria, you\u0027ve never been a child, but you\u0027re young and he\u0027s... Well he\u0027s far more advanced than you, he\u0027s a vampire and your worlds are so completely different that I saw only grief in your future. I thought it would be best if you returned to a more normal life, with people your own age and your own kind. I thought it would be best for the two of you.\" \"And now?\" William prodded before Aria could. \"And now I don\u0027t think there\u0027s any chance that what Jack proposes will work out. Even he is somehow unable to track you through your blood, Braith is not going to let you go, not unless you ask him to, and even then I don\u0027t think it will be a good situation. It was bad enough when you first escaped the palace, you were lost and heartbroken. The two of you are closer now, your bond has grown and strengthened. I\u0027ve never seen anything like it. If Jack is right then you know the choice you have to make, the one that you\u0027ve already made. But if Jack is wrong it\u0027s going to be bad Aria, very bad, and you know that.\" \"What would you do?\" she whispered, shaken by his words. He shook his head, his hand slipped inside his shirt as he pulled something free. \"I don\u0027t know. That\u0027s the kicker of it all, I don\u0027t know. But I know you, and I know that in the end you\u0027ll make the right choice, but only you will be able to make it. I\u0027ll miss you if you choose to leave, and I\u0027ll stand by you if you choose to stay.\" \"Thank you.\" He grinned at her, flashing a smile that was so endearingly similar to what she remembered of their mother\u0027s. \"For saying aloud the same things you already knew?\" She laughed dryly as she rested her head against the trunk of the tree. \"For standing by me no matter what. How did it all come to this?\" \"You let yourself get caught and hauled into that palace,\" William informed her. \"Yeah that\u0027s exactly what I let happen,\" she retorted. They sat together for a long time, silent as they listened to the familiar sounds of the forest. \"No matter what happens Aria, something good will come of it.\" \"I hope so. He\u0027s coming.\" \"How do you...\" William broke off the question. \"Never mind.\" \"This is for you.\" She started as Daniel slid something into her hand. Her mouth parted as she gazed wonderingly at the beautiful drawing before her. Tears clogged her throat. She\u0027d always known Daniel was a talented artist, a trait that he never had enough time for, but this was far beyond anything she could have imagined. She was curled within Braith\u0027s lap, her head on his chest as he rested his chin on her head to look at the book in his hand. The looks of love on their faces nearly caused her to sob aloud. \"I came across you by accident. I just saw you for a moment,\" Daniel added quickly when her face colored faintly. \"It was then I realized that what\u0027s between you isn\u0027t something easily broken, it\u0027s not a passing fancy, it\u0027s not a rebellious moment, it\u0027s not even just love. It\u0027s something more, it\u0027s this.\" He pointed at their faces in the drawing. \"It astounded me Aria; I can only hope that I find something like this one day.\" \"Daniel,\" she breathed, tears slowly rolling down her face. \"It\u0027s beautiful.\" \"No matter what you decide, I think you should have this.\" She nodded as he ruffled her hair affectionately. William was staring at the sketch over her shoulder when Braith emerged from the cave. \"Do you want me to take it?\" \"Yes.\" William took the drawing from her and slipped it into his shirt. \"I\u0027ll keep it safe.\" \"I know.\" They remained seated; their heads tilting back as Braith stopped before them. \"It\u0027s not safe up here.\" \"We\u0027re fine. We know these woods better than most of the animals.\" He didn\u0027t seem at all appeased by her reassurance. He stared hard at each of her brother\u0027s obviously wanting them to leave, while she wanted them to stay right where they were. \"How did it go?\" He locked his hands behind his back. \"We\u0027re going to run a few scouting missions to the palace and back. I would like for you to go on one Daniel, so you can get a feel of the town and its dimensions in order to formulate a design.\" \"Of course,\" Daniel murmured in assent. \"When do you think we\u0027ll be ready to make a move on the palace?\" William inquired. \"Hopefully within two weeks. I would prefer to move by the end of this week but I realize that\u0027s asking a lot. Jack, Saul, and Barnaby are going into the outer towns to gather the vampire\u0027s Jack recruited there. We\u0027ll need them here before we can make any solid plans.\" \"I\u0027d like to go on one of the scouting missions,\" Aria informed him. He frowned at her, his fingers curled and uncurled at his sides. \"Aria...\" \"I\u0027ve gone on plenty with Daniel and William before.\" A muscle jumped in his cheek as his jaw clenched. \"I\u0027ll be fine, and I\u0027m tired of feeling useless and confined. I have to do something useful.\" \"We\u0027ll keep her safe, even from herself,\" William nudged her playfully. She rolled her eyes at him and shook her head. He wasn\u0027t helping. \"No one will recognize me. I need to do this Braith.\" The last thing she wanted was to fight with him, but she simply couldn\u0027t sit here for the next couple of weeks, being torn apart by her decision and feeling useless. She had to find something to do or she would go crazy. \"Fine,\" he relented, his shoulders slumping. She didn\u0027t feel even a little good about the fact that she had gotten her way; she simply felt the gulf between them growing. It took everything she had not to cry as she bowed her head. She couldn\u0027t look at him anymore, it was too difficult.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/refugee-the-captive-3/page-19.html","bookId":2166,"book":{"id":2166,"title":"Refugee (The Captive #3)","description":"Storyline: Refugee (The Captive #3) Whispers, rumors, and horror stories abound about The Barrens and the strange creatures that lurk within them.
