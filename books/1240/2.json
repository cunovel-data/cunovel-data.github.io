{"id":36296,"no":2,"title":"CHAPTER II. HOMEWARD BOUND.","content":"\"All hands up anchor! Man the capstan!\" \"High die! my lads, we\u0027re homeward bound!\" Homeward bound!—harmonious sound! Were you ever homeward bound?—No?—Quick! take the wings of the morning, or the sails of a ship, and fly to the uttermost parts of the earth. There, tarry a year or two; and then let the gruffest of boatswains, his lungs all goose-skin, shout forth those magical words, and you\u0027ll swear \"the harp of Orpheus were not more enchanting.\" All was ready; boats hoisted in, stun\u0027 sail gear rove, messenger passed, capstan-bars in their places, accommodation-ladder below; and in glorious spirits, we sat down to dinner. In the ward-room, the lieutenants were passing round their oldest port, and pledging their friends; in the steerage, the middies were busy raising loans to liquidate the demands of their laundress, or else—in the navy phrase—preparing to pay their creditors with a flying fore-topsail. On the poop, the captain was looking to windward; and in his grand, inaccessible cabin, the high and mighty commodore sat silent and stately, as the statue of Jupiter in Dodona. We were all arrayed in our best, and our bravest; like strips of blue sky, lay the pure blue collars of our frocks upon our shoulders; and our pumps were so springy and playful, that we danced up and down as we dined. It was on the gun-deck that our dinners were spread; all along between the guns; and there, as we cross-legged sat, you would have thought a hundred farm-yards and meadows were nigh. Such a cackling of ducks, chickens, and ganders; such a lowing of oxen, and bleating of lambkins, penned up here and there along the deck, to provide sea repasts for the officers. More rural than naval were the sounds; continually reminding each mother\u0027s son of the old paternal homestead in the green old clime; the old arching elms; the hill where we gambolled; and down by the barley banks of the stream where we bathed. \"All hands up anchor!\" When that order was given, how we sprang to the bars, and heaved round that capstan; every man a Goliath, every tendon a hawser!—round and round—round, round it spun like a sphere, keeping time with our feet to the time of the fifer, till the cable was straight up and down, and the ship with her nose in the water. \"Heave and pall! unship your bars, and make sail!\" It was done: barmen, nipper-men, tierers, veerers, idlers and all, scrambled up the ladder to the braces and halyards; while like monkeys in Palm-trees, the sail-loosers ran out on those broad boughs, our yards; and down fell the sails like white clouds from the ether—topsails, top-gallants, and royals; and away we ran with the halyards, till every sheet was distended. \"Once more to the bars!\" \"Heave, my hearties, heave hard!\" With a jerk and a yerk, we broke ground; and up to our bows came several thousand pounds of old iron, in the shape of our ponderous anchor. Where was White-Jacket then? White-Jacket was where he belonged. It was White-Jacket that loosed that main-royal, so far up aloft there, it looks like a white albatross\u0027 wing. It was White-Jacket that was taken for an albatross himself, as he flew out on the giddy yard-arm!","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2831/78163.html","bookId":1240,"book":{"id":1240,"title":"White Jacket or, the World on a Man-of-War","description":"简介： When our frigate lay in Callao, on the coast of Peruher last harbour in the PacificI found myself without a grego, or sailor\u0027s surtout; and as, toward the end of a three years\u0027 cruise, no pea-jackets could be had from the purser\u0027s steward: and being...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2831","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:42 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:42 AM"}}
