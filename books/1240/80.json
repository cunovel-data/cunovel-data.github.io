{"id":36374,"no":80,"title":"CHAPTER LXXX. THE LAST STITCH.","content":"Just before daybreak, two of the sail-maker\u0027s gang drew near, each with a lantern, carrying some canvas, two large shot, needles, and twine. I knew their errand; for in men-of-war the sail-maker is the undertaker. They laid the body on deck, and, after fitting the canvas to it, seated themselves, cross-legged like tailors, one on each side, and, with their lanterns before them, went to stitching away, as if mending an old sail. Both were old men, with grizzled hair and beard, and shrunken faces. They belonged to that small class of aged seamen who, for their previous long and faithful services, are retained in the Navy more as pensioners upon its merited bounty than anything else. They are set to light and easy duties. \"Ar\u0027n\u0027t this the fore-top-man, Shenly?\" asked the foremost, looking full at the frozen face before him. \"Ay, ay, old Ringrope,\" said the other, drawing his hand far back with a long thread, \"I thinks it\u0027s him; and he\u0027s further aloft now, I hope, than ever he was at the fore-truck. But I only hopes; I\u0027m afeard this ar\u0027n\u0027t the last on him!\" \"His hull here will soon be going out of sight below hatches, though, old Thrummings,\" replied Ringrope, placing two heavy cannon-balls in the foot of the canvas shroud. \"I don\u0027t know that, old man; I never yet sewed up a ship-mate but he spooked me arterward. I tell ye, Ring-rope, these \u0027ere corpses is cunning. You think they sinks deep, but they comes up again as soon as you sails over \u0027em. They lose the number of their mess, and their mess-mates sticks the spoons in the rack; but no good—no good, old Ringrope; they ar\u0027n\u0027t dead yet. I tell ye, now, ten best—bower-anchors wouldn\u0027t sink this \u0027ere top-man. He\u0027ll be soon coming in the wake of the thirty-nine spooks what spooks me every night in my hammock—jist afore the mid-watch is called. Small thanks I gets for my pains; and every one on \u0027em looks so \u0027proachful-like, with a sail-maker\u0027s needle through his nose. I\u0027ve been thinkin\u0027, old Ringrope, it\u0027s all wrong that \u0027ere last stitch we takes. Depend on\u0027t, they don\u0027t like it—none on \u0027em.\" I was standing leaning over a gun, gazing at the two old men. The last remark reminded me of a superstitious custom generally practised by most sea-undertakers upon these occasions. I resolved that, if I could help it, it should not take place upon the remains of Shenly. \"Thrummings,\" said I, advancing to the last speaker, \"you are right. That last thing you do to the canvas is the very reason, be sure of it, that brings the ghosts after you, as you say. So don\u0027t do it to this poor fellow, I entreat. Try once, now, how it goes not to do it.\" \"What do you say to the youngster, old man?\" said Thrummings, holding up his lantern into his comrade\u0027s wrinkled face, as if deciphering some ancient parchment. \"I\u0027m agin all innowations,\" said Ringrope; \"it\u0027s a good old fashion, that last stitch; it keeps \u0027em snug, d\u0027ye see, youngster. I\u0027m blest if they could sleep sound, if it wa\u0027n\u0027t for that. No, no, Thrummings! no innowations; I won\u0027t hear on\u0027t. I goes for the last stitch!\" \"S\u0027pose you was going to be sewed up yourself, old Ringrope, would you like the last stitch then! You are an old, gun, Ringrope; you can\u0027t stand looking out at your port-hole much longer,\" said Thrummings, as his own palsied hands were quivering over the canvas. \"Better say that to yourself, old man,\" replied Ringrope, stooping close to the light to thread his coarse needle, which trembled in his withered hands like the needle, in a compass of a Greenland ship near the Pole. \"You ain\u0027t long for the sarvice. I wish I could give you some o\u0027 the blood in my veins, old man!\" \"Ye ain\u0027t got ne\u0027er a teaspoonful to spare,\" said Thrummings. \"It will go hard, and I wouldn\u0027t want to do it; but I\u0027m afeard I\u0027ll have the sewing on ye up afore long!\" \"Sew me up? Me dead and you alive, old man?\" shrieked Ringrope. \"Well, I\u0027ve he\u0027rd the parson of the old Independence say as how old age was deceitful; but I never seed it so true afore this blessed night. I\u0027m sorry for ye, old man—to see you so innocent-like, and Death all the while turning in and out with you in your hammock, for all the world like a hammock-mate.\" \"You lie! old man,\" cried Thrummings, shaking with rage. \"It\u0027s you that have Death for a hammock-mate; it\u0027s you that will make a hole in the shot-locker soon.\" \"Take that back!\" cried Ringrope, huskily, leaning far over the corpse, and, needle in hand, menacing his companion with his aguish fist. \"Take that back, or I\u0027ll throttle your lean bag of wind fer ye!\" \"Blast ye! old chaps, ain\u0027t ye any more manners than to be fighting over a dead man?\" cried one of the sail-maker\u0027s mates, coming down from the spar-deck. \"Bear a hand!—bear a hand! and get through with that job!\" \"Only one more stitch to take,\" muttered Ringrope, creeping near the face. \"drop your \u0027palm,\u0027 then and let Thrummings take it; follow me—the foot of the main-sail wants mending—must do it afore a breeze springs up. D\u0027ye hear, old chap! I say, drop your palm, and follow me.\" At the reiterated command of his superior, Ringrope rose, and, turning to his comrade, said, \"I take it all back, Thrummings, and I\u0027m sorry for it, too. But mind ye, take that \u0027ere last stitch, now; if ye don\u0027t, there\u0027s no tellin\u0027 the consekenses.\" As the mate and his man departed, I stole up to Thrummings. \"Don\u0027t do it—don\u0027t do it, now, Thrummings—depend on it, it\u0027s wrong!\" \"Well, youngster, I\u0027ll try this here one without it for jist this here once; and if, arter that, he don\u0027t spook me, I\u0027ll be dead agin the last stitch as long as my name is Thrummings.\" So, without mutilation, the remains were replaced between the guns, the union jack again thrown over them, and I reseated myself on the shot-box. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2831/78241.html","bookId":1240,"book":{"id":1240,"title":"White Jacket or, the World on a Man-of-War","description":"简介： When our frigate lay in Callao, on the coast of Peruher last harbour in the PacificI found myself without a grego, or sailor\u0027s surtout; and as, toward the end of a three years\u0027 cruise, no pea-jackets could be had from the purser\u0027s steward: and being...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2831","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:42 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:42 AM"}}
