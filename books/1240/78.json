{"id":36372,"no":78,"title":"CHAPTER LXXVIII. DISMAL TIMES IN THE MESS.","content":"It was on the first day of the long, hot calm which we had on the Equator, that a mess-mate of mine, by the name of Shenly, who had been for some weeks complaining, at length went on the sick-list. An old gunner\u0027s mate of the mess—Priming, the man with the hare-lip, who, true to his tribe, was charged to the muzzle with bile, and, moreover, rammed home on top of it a wad of sailor superstition—this gunner\u0027s mate indulged in some gloomy and savage remarks—strangely tinged with genuine feeling and grief—at the announcement of the sick-ness of Shenly, coming as it did not long after the almost fatal accident befalling poor Baldy, captain of the mizzen-top, another mess-mate of ours, and the dreadful fate of the amputated fore-top-man whom we buried in Rio, also our mess-mate. We were cross-legged seated at dinner, between the guns, when the sad news concerning Shenly was first communicated. \"I know\u0027d it, I know\u0027d it,\" said Priming, through his nose. \"Blast ye, I told ye so; poor fellow! But dam\u0027me, I know\u0027d it. This comes of having thirteen in the mess. I hope he arn\u0027t dangerous, men? Poor Shenly! But, blast it, it warn\u0027t till White-Jacket there comed into the mess that these here things began. I don\u0027t believe there\u0027ll be more nor three of us left by the time we strike soundings, men. But how is he now? Have you been down to see him, any on ye? Damn you, you Jonah! I don\u0027t see how you can sleep in your hammock, knowing as you do that by making an odd number in the mess you have been the death of one poor fellow, and ruined Baldy for life, and here\u0027s poor Shenly keeled up. Blast you, and your jacket, say I.\" \"My dear mess-mate,\" I cried, \"don\u0027t blast me any more, for Heaven\u0027s sale. Blast my jacket you may, and I\u0027ll join you in that; but don\u0027t blast me; for if you do, I shouldn\u0027t wonder if I myself was the next man to keel up.\" \"Gunner\u0027s mate!\" said Jack Chase, helping himself to a slice of beef, and sandwiching it between two large biscuits—\"Gunner\u0027s mate! White-Jacket there is my particular friend, and I would take it as a particular favour if you would knock off blasting him. It\u0027s in bad taste, rude, and unworthy a gentleman.\" \"Take your back away from that \u0027ere gun-carriage, will ye now, Jack Chase?\" cried Priming, in reply, just then Jack happening to lean up against it. \"Must I be all the time cleaning after you fellows? Blast ye! I spent an hour on that \u0027ere gun-carriage this very mornin\u0027. But it all comes of White-Jacket there. If it warn\u0027t for having one too many, there wouldn\u0027t be any crowding and jamming in the mess. I\u0027m blessed if we ar\u0027n\u0027t about chock a\u0027 block here! Move further up there, I\u0027m sitting on my leg!\" \"For God\u0027s sake, gunner\u0027s mate,\" cried I, \"if it will content you, I and my jacket will leave the mess.\" \"I wish you would, and be —— to you!\" he replied. \"And if he does, you will mess alone, gunner\u0027s mate,\" said Jack Chase. \"That you will,\" cried all. \"And I wish to the Lord you\u0027d let me!\" growled Priming, irritably rubbing his head with the handle of his sheath-knife. \"You are an old bear, gunner\u0027s mate,\" said Jack Chase. \"I am an old Turk,\" he replied, drawing the flat blade of his knife between his teeth, thereby producing a whetting, grating sound. \"Let him alone, let him alone, men,\" said Jack Chase. \"Only keep off the tail of a rattlesnake, and he\u0027ll not rattle.\" \"Look out he don\u0027t bite, though,\" said Priming, snapping his teeth; and with that he rolled off, growling as he went. Though I did my best to carry off my vexation with an air of indifference, need I say how I cursed my jacket, that it thus seemed the means of fastening on me the murder of one of my shipmates, and the probable murder of two more. For, had it not been for my jacket, doubtless, I had yet been a member of my old mess, and so have escaped making the luckless odd number among my present companions. All I could say in private to Priming had no effect; though I often took him aside, to convince him of the philosophical impossibility of my having been accessary to the misfortunes of Baldy, the buried sailor in Rio, and Shenly. But Priming knew better; nothing could move him; and he ever afterward eyed me as virtuous citizens do some notorious underhand villain going unhung of justice. Jacket! jacket! thou hast much to answer for, jacket! \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2831/78239.html","bookId":1240,"book":{"id":1240,"title":"White Jacket or, the World on a Man-of-War","description":"简介： When our frigate lay in Callao, on the coast of Peruher last harbour in the PacificI found myself without a grego, or sailor\u0027s surtout; and as, toward the end of a three years\u0027 cruise, no pea-jackets could be had from the purser\u0027s steward: and being...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2831","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:42 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:42 AM"}}
