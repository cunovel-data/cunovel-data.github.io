{"id":11661,"no":14,"title":"CHAPTER XIV. A STRUGGLE FOR FAME.","content":"The two young men walked slowly up the street in the direction of the Bon-Bon Theatre, passing into Swanston Street just as the Town Hall clock struck eleven. It was a beautiful moonlight night, but no breeze was blowing, and the heat which the earth had drawn to her bosom during the day was now exhaled from the warm ground in a faint humid vapour. Crowds of people were in the streets sauntering idly along, evidently unwilling to go to bed. The great buildings stood up white and spectral-like on the one side of the street, while on the other they loomed out black against the clear sky. The garish flare of the innumerable street lamps seemed out of place under the serene splendour of the heavens, and the frequent cries of the street boys, and noisy rattling of passing cabs, jarred on the ear. At least Keith thought so, for, after walking in silence for some time, he turned with a gesture of irritation to his companion. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Isn\u0027t this noise disagreeable?\" he said impatiently; \"under such a perfect sky the city ought to lie dead like a fantastic dream of the Arabian Nights, but the gas lamps and incessant restlessness of Melbourne vulgarises the whole thing.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Poetical, certainly,\" replied Ezra, rousing himself from his abstraction; \"but I should not care to inhabit an enchanted city. To me there is something grand in this restless crowd of people, all instinct with life and ambition--the gas lamps jar on your dream, but they are evidences of civilisation, and the hoarse murmur of the mob is like the mutterings of a distant storm, or white waves breaking on a lonely coast. No, my friend, leave the enchanted cities to dreamland, and live the busy life of the nineteenth century.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Your ideas and wishes are singularly at variance,\" said Keith smiling. \"The city suggests poetical thoughts to you, but you reject them and lower yourself to the narrow things of everyday.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I am a man, and must live as one,\" replied the Jew, with a sigh; \"it\u0027s hard enough to do so--Heaven knows!--without creating Paradises at whose doors we must ever stand like lost Peris.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What\u0027s the matter with you to-night?\" asked Keith abruptly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Nothing particular; only I\u0027ve had a quarrel with my father.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Is that all? My dear Lazarus, your father lives in an atmosphere of quarrelling--it\u0027s bread and meat to him--so you needn\u0027t fret over a few words. What was the quarrel about?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Money.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Humph!--generally a fruitful cause of dissension. Tell me all about it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You know how I love Rachel?\" said Lazarus quietly. \"Well, I am anxious to marry her and have a home of my own. It\u0027s weary work living in tents like a Bedouin. I get a good salary, it\u0027s true; but I asked my father to give me a sufficient sum of ready money to buy a piece of land and a house. I might have saved myself the trouble--he refused, and we had angry words, so parted in anger.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I wouldn\u0027t bother about it, if I were you,\" said Keith consolingly. \"Words break no bones--besides, this burlesque may bring us a lot of money, and then you can marry Rachel when you please.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t expect much money out of it,\" replied the Jew, with a frown. \"It\u0027s our first piece, and Mortimer will drive a hard bargain with us--but you seem very hopeful to-night.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I have cause to. Eugénie has written me a letter, in which she says she is coming to Melbourne.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s good news, indeed. Is she going to stay?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I think so,\" said Keith gaily. \"I told you she was a governess, so she has replied to an advertisement in the Argus. and hopes to get the situation.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I trust she will,\" observed Ezra, smiling at Keith\u0027s delight. \"She will do you a lot of good by her presence, and guard you from the spells of Armida.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Alias Caprice. Thanks for the warning, but I\u0027ve not been ensnared by the fair enchantress yet, and never mean to; but here we are at the theatre. I hope we get good terms from Mortimer.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"So do I, for Rachel\u0027s sake.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We are both preux chevaliers. anxious to gain for our lady-loves not fame, but money. Oh, base desire!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It may be base, but it\u0027s very necessary,\" replied the prudent Jew, and they both entered the stage-door of the theatre. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mortimer\u0027s sanctum was a very well-furnished room, displaying considerable taste on the part of the occupant, for the manager of the \"Bon-Bon\" was sybaritic in his ideas. The floor was covered with a heavy velvet carpet, and the walls adorned with excellent pictures, while the furniture was all chosen for comfort as well as for ornament. Mortimer was seated at his desk with a confused mass of papers before him, and leaning back in a chair near him was Caprice, who looked rather pale and worn. \\n\\n \\n\\n There was a lamp on the table with a heavy shade, which concentrated all the light into a circle, and Kitty\u0027s pale face, with its aureole of fair hair seen in the powerful radiance, appeared strange and unreal. Dark circles under her heavy eyes, faint lines round the small mouth, and the weary look now habitual to her, all combined to give her face a wan and spiritual look which made even Mortimer shiver as he looked at her. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hang it, Kitty,\" he said roughly, \"don\u0027t look so dismal. You ought to see a doctor.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What for?\" she asked listlessly. \"I\u0027m quite well.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Humph! I don\u0027t think so. You\u0027ve been going down the hill steadily the last few months. Look how thin you are--a bag of bones.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"So was Rachel,\" replied Caprice, with a faint smile. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, she didn\u0027t live very long. Besides, you ain\u0027t Rachel,\" growled Mortimer, \"and I don\u0027t want you to get ill just now.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, you could hardly supply my place,\" said Caprice, with a sneer. \"Don\u0027t you bother yourself, Mortimer, I\u0027m not going to die yet. When I do I sha\u0027n\u0027t be sorry; life hasn\u0027t been so pleasant to me that I should wish to live.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know what you want,\" grumbled the manager; \"you\u0027ve got all Melbourne at your feet.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I can\u0027t say much for Melbourne\u0027s morality, then,\" retorted Caprice bitterly; \"circumstances have made me what I am, but I\u0027m getting tired of the cakes and ale business. If I could only secure the future of my child, I\u0027d turn religious.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mary Magdalen!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, a case of history repeating itself, isn\u0027t it?\" she replied, with a harsh laugh. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Strange!\" said Mortimer, scrutinising her narrowly; \"the worse a woman is in her youth, the more devout she becomes in her old age.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"On the authority of M. de la Rochefoucauld, I suppose,\" answered Caprice; \"old age gives good advice when it no longer can give bad example.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Who told you that?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"A man you never knew--Vandeloup.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know that my not being acquainted with him was much to be regretted.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, I don\u0027t think it was,\" replied Caprice coolly; \"he had twice your brains--to know him was a liberal education.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"In cheap cynicism, gad, you\u0027ve been an apt pupil.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Kitty laughed, and, rising from her seat, began to walk to and fro. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I wish those boys would come,\" she said restlessly; \"I want to go home.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then go,\" said Mortimer; \"you needn\u0027t stay.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, yes, I need,\" she replied; \"I want to see that they get good terms for their play.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll give them a fair price,\" said Mortimer; \"but I\u0027m not going to be so liberal as you expect.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ve no doubt of that.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I believe you\u0027re sweet on that Stewart.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Perhaps I am!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Meddlechip won\u0027t like that,\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Pish! I don\u0027t care two straws for Meddlechip.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No; but you do for his money.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Of course; that goes without saying.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027re a hardened little devil, Caprice.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"God knows I\u0027ve had enough to make me hard,\" she replied bitterly, throwing herself down in her chair, with a frown. \\n\\n \\n\\n There was a knock at the door at this moment, and, in reply to Mortimer\u0027s invitation to \"come in,\" Ezra and Keith appeared. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, you two are late,\" said Mortimer, glancing at his watch; \"a quarter-past eleven.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m very sorry,\" said Ezra quietly; \"but it was my fault. I was telling Stewart about some business.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, we won\u0027t take long to settle this affair,\" remarked Mortimer, looking over his papers. \"Be seated, gentlemen.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Keith took off his overcoat and threw it over the back of a chair, on which Kitty\u0027s fur-lined mantle was already resting. \\n\\n \\n\\n Caprice, who had flushed up on the advance of Stewart, leaned back in her chair, while Keith sat down near her, and Ezra took a position opposite, close to Mortimer. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Now then, gentlemen,\" said Mortimer, playing with a paper-cutter, \"about this burlesque--what is your opinion?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s rather a curious question to ask an author,\" replied Keith gaily. \"We naturally think it excellent.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I hope the public will think the same,\" observed Mortimer drily; \"but I don\u0027t mean that. I want to know your terms.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Of course,\" said Ezra, smoothly; \"but just tell us what you are prepared to give.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m buyer, gentlemen, you are sellers,\" replied the manager shrewdly; \"I can\u0027t take up your position.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Kitty leaned back in her chair and bent over close to Keith\u0027s ear. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ask five pounds a night,\" she whispered. \\n\\n \\n\\n Stewart glanced at Ezra, and seeing he was in doubt as to what to say, spoke out loudly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Speaking for myself and partner, I think we\u0027ll take five pounds a night.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, I\u0027ll agree to that,\" observed Ezra eagerly \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ve no doubt you will,\" rejoined Mortimer, raising his eyebrows; \"that\u0027s thirty pounds a week, fifteen pounds apiece--a very nice sum, gentlemen--if you get it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then what do you propose to give?\" asked Keith. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"One pound for every performance.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Stewart laughed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Do you take us for born fools?\" he asked angrily. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, I do not,\" replied Mortimer, catching his chin between finger and thumb, and looking critically at the two young men; \"I take you for very clever boys who are just making a start, and I\u0027m willing to help you--at my own price--which is one pound a night.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The game\u0027s not worth the candle,\" said Ezra, in a disappointed tone. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, yes, it is,\" retorted Mortimer; \"it gives you a chance. Now, look here, I\u0027ve no desire to take advantage of my position, which, as you see, is a very strong one.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"In what way?\" asked Caprice, elevating her eyebrows. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mortimer explained in his slow voice as follows,--\"I can write home to London and get successful plays with big reputations already made.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, and pay big prices for them.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That may be,\" replied the manager imperturbably; \"but if I give a good price I get a good article that is sure to recoup me for my outlay. I don\u0027t say that \u0027Faust Upset\u0027 isn\u0027t good, but at the same time it\u0027s an experiment. Australians don\u0027t like their own raw material.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They never get the chance of seeing it,\" said Keith bitterly; \"you of course look at it from a business point of view, as is only proper, but seeing that you draw all your money from Colonial pockets, why not give Colonial brains a chance?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Because Colonial brains don\u0027t pay, Colonial pockets do,\" said Mortimer coolly; \"besides, I am giving you a chance, and that at considerable risk to myself. I will put on this burlesque in good style because Caprice is dead set on it; but business is business, and I can\u0027t afford to lose money on an untried production.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Suppose it turns out a great success,\" said Ezra, \"we, the authors, only make six pounds a week, while you take all the profits.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Certainly,\" retorted Mortimer; \"I\u0027ve taken the risk.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then if we make a great success of this burlesque,\" said Keith, \"you will give us better terms for the next thing we write?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, yes,\" said the manager, in a hesitating manner; \"but, of course, though your position is improved, mine is still the same.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I understand; as long as you have the run of the London market, you can treat Colonial playwrights as you choose?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027ve stated the case exactly.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s an unfair advantage.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No doubt, but business is business. I hold the trump card.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s a bad lookout for the literary and musical future of Australia when such men as you hold the cards,\" said Ezra gloomily; \"but it\u0027s no use arguing the case. I\u0027ve heard all this sort of thing before. The Australians are too busy making money to trouble about such a contemptible thing as literary work.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll tell you what, Mortimer,\" broke in Caprice, \"give them two pounds a night for the piece.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not I.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes you will, or I don\u0027t show at the Bon-Bon.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You forget your engagement, my dear,\" said Mortimer complacently. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, I don\u0027t,\" retorted Kitty, snapping her fingers; \"that for my engagement. I don\u0027t care if I broke it to-morrow. You\u0027ve got your remedy, no doubt; try it, and see what you\u0027ll make of it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Mortimer looked uneasily at her. He knew he had the law on his side, but Caprice was so reckless that she cared for nothing, and would do what she pleased in spite of both him and the law. Besides, he could not afford to lose her, so he met her half way. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Tell you what,\" he said genially, \"I\u0027ve no wish to be hard on you, boys--I\u0027ll give you one pound a night for a week, and if the burlesque is a success, two pounds--there, that\u0027s fair.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I suppose it\u0027s the best terms we can get,\" said Keith recklessly; \"anything for the chance of having a play put on the stage. What do you say, Lazarus?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I accept,\" replied the Jew briefly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"In that case,\" said Kitty, rising, \"I needn\u0027t stay any longer. Mr. Lazarus, will you take me to my carriage?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Allow me,\" said Keith advancing. \\n\\n \\n\\n Kitty recoiled, and an angry light flashed in her eyes. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, thank you,\" she said coldly, snatching up her cloak, \"Mr. Lazarus will see me down,\" and without another word she swept out of the room, followed by Ezra, who was much astonished at the rebuff Keith had received. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What\u0027s that for?\" asked Mortimer looking up. \"I thought you were the white boy there.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure I don\u0027t know,\" said Keith, in a puzzled tone. \"She has been rather cold to me for the last three months, but she never snubbed me till now.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, she\u0027s never the same two minutes together,\" said Mortimer, turning once more to his desk. \"Have a drink?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Keith nodded, whereupon Mortimer, who was the most hospitable of men, brought forth whisky and seltzer. As he was filling the glasses, Ezra re-entered with Keith\u0027s coat. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Caprice carried this downstairs with her by mistake,\" he said, giving it to Keith, \"and called me back to return it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Gad! she went off in such a whirlwind of passion I don\u0027t wonder she took it. I\u0027m glad she left the chair,\" said Mortimer coolly. \"Will you join us?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, thanks,\" replied Ezra, putting on his hat. \"I\u0027ve got to go back to the office. Good-night. See you to-morrow, Keith; you can settle with Mortimer about the agreement,\" and thereupon he vanished. \\n\\n \\n\\n Keith and Mortimer sat down, and the latter drafted out an agreement about the play which he promised to send to his lawyer, and then, if the young men approved of it, the whole affair could be settled right off. \\n\\n \\n\\n This took a considerable time, and it was about half-past twelve when Keith, having said good-night to Mortimer, left the theatre. He walked down Collins Street, smoking his cigarette, and thinking about his good luck and Eugénie. How delighted she would be at his success. He would make lots of money, and then he could marry her. After wandering about for some considerable time, he turned homeward. Walking up Bourke Street, he entered Russell Street, and went on towards East Melbourne. Passing along in front of Lazarus\u0027 shop, he saw a man leaning against the door. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What are you doing there?\" asked Keith sharply, going up to him. \\n\\n \\n\\n The man struck out feebly with his fists, and giving an indistinct growl, lurched heavily against Keith, who promptly knocked him down, and had a tussle with him. The moon was shining brightly, and, as the light fell on his face, Keith recognised him instantly--it was Randolph Villiers. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027d better go home, Villiers,\" he said quickly, raising him to his feet, \"you\u0027ll be getting into trouble.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Go to devil,\" said Mr. Villiers, in a husky voice, lurching into the centre of the street. \"I\u0027m out on business. I know what I know, and if you knew what I knew, you\u0027d know a lot--eh! wouldn\u0027t you?\" and he leered at Stewart. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Pah, you\u0027re drunk,\" said Stewart in disgust, turning on his heel; \"you\u0027d better get home, or you\u0027ll get into some mischief.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, I won\u0027t,\" growled Villiers, \"but I know some \u0027un as will.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Who?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, I know--I know,\" retorted Villiers, and went lurching down the street, setting the words to a popular tune,-- \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I know a thing or two, \\n\\n Yes I do--just a few.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Keith looked at the drunken man rolling heavily down the street--a black, misshapen figure in the moonlight--and then, turning away with a laugh, walked thence to East Melbourne thinking of Eugénie. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1861/53893.html","bookId":829,"book":{"id":829,"title":"Miss Mephistopheles","description":"简介： A wet Sunday--dreary, dismal, and infinitely sloppy.
