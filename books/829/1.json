{"id":11648,"no":1,"title":"CHAPTER I. FACES IN THE FIRE.","content":"A wet Sunday--dreary, dismal, and infinitely sloppy. Even the bells ringing the people into evening service seemed to feel the depressing influence of the weather, and their brazen voices sounded hoarse and grumbling, as if they rang under protest. Cold, too!--not a brisk sharp frost--for here in Melbourne frost and snow are unknown; but a persevering, insinuating, gnawing cold, just disagreeable enough to make one shiver and shake with anxiety to get home to a bright fire and dry clothes. Overhead a leaden-coloured sky, with great masses of black clouds, from out whose sombre bosoms poured the steady rain, splashing noisily on the shining roofs, and swelling the gutters in the streets to miniature torrents. And then the wind,--a gusty, chilly wind,--that came along unexpectedly, and drove the unwilling rain against the umbrellas of struggling pedestrians, or else took a mean advantage of its power, and turned their umbrellas inside out, with a shrill whistle of triumph. The steady light streamed out from the painted church windows, and the dull, blurred glare of the street lamps was reflected in the wet pavements. Ugh! a night not fit for a dog to be out in, and yet there were a good many people hurrying along to the church, in answer to the clamorous voices of the bells. Some folk, however--wise in their generation--preferred staying at home to sitting in church, with damp boots and a general sense of stickiness about their clothes, and though possibly their souls suffered from such an omission, their bodies were certainly more comfortable. Among these godless people, who thus preferred comfort to religion, were two young men occupying a room on a first floor, the windows of which looked across to the church, now full of damp and steaming worshippers. A room in a boarding-house--especially one where boarders only pay twenty-five shillings a week--is not generally a very luxurious apartment, and this special room was certainly no exception to the rule. It was square, with a fairly lofty ceiling, and the walls were covered with a dull red paper, which, being mellowed by time, had assumed a somewhat rusty hue. It was rapidly growing dark outside, and there was no light in the room, save that which came from a roaring coal fire blazing brightly up the chimney, and illuminating the apartment in a curiously fantastic manner. It sent out red shafts of light into dark corners, as if to find out what was hidden there, and then being disappointed, would sink back into a dull, sulky glow, only to fall into a chaotic mass, and blaze merrily up once more. The apartment wherein the fire played these elfish tricks was furnished comfortably, but the furniture had a somewhat dingy look. The carpet was threadbare, except under the table, where there could be traced some vestiges of its original pattern. A cottage piano was pushed into a corner slanting ways, and beside it was a great untidy pile of music. At one end of the room, a desk covered with papers, and immediately above it a shelf containing a small array of well-worn books. Near the desk stood an aggravatingly bright sideboard, whereon were some glasses, a jug of water, and a half-empty bottle of whisky. Four or five lounging chairs of wicker-work were scattered about, covered with rugs of wallaby fur, whilst the walls and mantelpiece were almost covered with photographs, mostly of women, but here and there a male face, showing the well-known features of Beethoven, Chopin, and other famous musicians. This somewhat incongruous apartment was a private sitting-room in an East Melbourne boarding-house, and was at present in the occupation of Ezra Lazarus, journalist. Ezra Lazarus himself was seated at the piano playing snatches of music, while on the hearth-rug, smoking a pipe, lay a man propped up on his elbow, with his head resting on his hand, staring into the burning coals, and listening to his friend playing. Ezra Lazarus was a young man of medium height, with a slender figure, a pale face, rather dreamy, dark eyes, and black hair and beard carefully trimmed. He dressed neatly, and, in contrast to most of his race, wore no jewellery. Why he had become a journalist no one knew,--himself least of all,--as his tastes did not lie in the direction of newspaper work, for having all the Hebraic love of music, he was an accomplished pianist. As for the rest--staid in his demeanour, soft-spoken in his language, and much given to solitary wanderings. Yet he was no misanthrope, and those who knew him intimately found him a most charming companion, full of quaint ideas and bookish lore, but he was essentially a man of ideality, and shrank from contact with the work-a-day world. For such a nature as this a journalistic sphere was most unsuitable, and he felt it to be so, but having drifted into such a position, he lacked the energy to extricate himself from his uncongenial employment, and accepted his fate with oriental apathy, recompensing himself in some measure by giving every spare moment to the study of music. The man lying before the fire was the direct opposite of Ezra, both in appearance and temperament. A tall, sinewy-figured young fellow of six-and-twenty, with restless keen grey eyes under strongly-marked eyebrows, and a sensitive mouth, almost hidden by a small fair moustache. His nose was thin and straight, with delicately-cut nostrils, and his head was well set on his broad shoulders, albeit he had a trick of throwing it back which gave him a somewhat haughty carriage. He had a fair complexion, with that reddish-brown hue which comes from constantly living in the open air, and altogether looked like a man addicted to sport rather than to study. This was Keith Stewart, who, having passed most of his life in Gippsland, and in wandering about Australia generally, had a year previously come down to Melbourne with the laudable intention of devoting himself to literature. That he was poor might be surmised from his shabby, well-brushed clothes, and his face constantly wore that expression of watchfulness habitual to those who have to fight the world in their youth and be on their guard against everyone. That two such dissimilar natures as these could find any reciprocity appears strange, but curiously enough some undercurrent of sympathy had drawn them together from the first time they met. Jew and Gentile, musician and student, different nationalities, different trains of thought, yet the mere fact that they could both live in an ideal world of their own creation, heedless of the restless life which seethed around, seemed to form a bond of concord between them, and their mutual isolation drew them almost imperceptibly together. Keith had only been boarding in the house a week, consequently Ezra knew nothing about his friend\u0027s life, beyond the fact that he was poor and ambitious. As Stewart never volunteered any information about himself, Ezra, with the delicacy of a sensitive nature, shrank from forcing himself on his confidence. The inexhaustible subjects of books and music, a walk by the banks of the Yarra, or an occasional visit to the theatre, had been, so far, the limit of their social companionship. Their inner selves were still unknown to each other. To all, however, there comes a moment when the desire to unburden the mind to a sympathetic nature is strong, and it was in such a moment that Ezra Lazarus first learned the past life of Stewart. On this dreary Sunday night Ezra let his fingers wander over the piano, vaguely following his thoughts, and the result was a queer mingling of melodies--now a bizarre polonaise of Chopin, with its fantastic blending of patriotic joy and despairing pain, then a rush of stormy chords, preluding a Spanish dance, instinct with the amorous languor and fierce passion of the south. Outside, the shrill wind could be heard sweeping past, a sheet of rain would lash wildly against the windows, and at intervals the musical thunder of the organ sounded from the adjacent church. Keith smoked away steadily and listened drowsily to the pleasant mingling of sounds, until Ezra began to play the Traviata music, with its feverish brilliancy and undercurrent of sadness. Then he suddenly started, clenched his hand, and taking his pipe from his mouth, heaved an impatient sigh, upon hearing which, Lazarus stopped playing, and turned slowly round. \"A link of memory?\" he said, in his soft voice, referring to the music. Stewart replaced his pipe, blew a thick wreath of smoke, and sighed again. \"Yes,\" he replied, after a pause; \"it recalls to me--a woman.\" Ezra laughed half sadly, half mockingly. \"Always the Eternal feminine of George Sand.\" Keith sat up cross-legged in front of the fire and shrugged his shoulders. \"Don\u0027t be cynical old chap,\" he said, glancing round; \"I\u0027m sick of hearing the incessant railing against women--good heavens! are we men so pure ourselves, that we can afford to cast stones against the sex to which our mothers and sisters belong.\" \"I did not mean to be cynical,\" replied Ezra, clasping his hands round one of his knees, \"I only quoted Sand, because when a man is thinking, it is generally--a woman. \"Or a debt--or a crime--or a sorrow,\" interposed the other quickly; \"we can ring the changes on all of them.\" \"Who is cynical now?\" asked the Jew, with a smile. \"Not I,\" denied Keith, emphatically, drawing hard at his pipe; \"or if I am, it is only that thin veneer of cynicism, under which we hide our natural feelings now-a-days; but the music took me back to the time when \u0027Plancus was consul\u0027--exactly twelve months ago.\" \"Bah! Plancus is consul still; don\u0027t be downhearted, my friend; you are still in the pleasant city of Prague.\" \"Pleasant? that is as it may be. I think it a very disagreeable city without money. Bohemianism is charming in novels, but in real life it is generally a hunt after what Murger calls that voracious animal, the half-crown.\" \"And after women!\" \"Ah, bah! Lais and Phryne; both charming, but slightly improper, not to say expensive.\" \"Take the other side of the shield,\" said the Jew gently. \"Lucretia, and--and--by Jove, I can\u0027t recollect the name of any other virtuous woman.\" \"Who is the lady of the music?\" \"My affianced wife,\" retorted Stewart curtly. \"Ah!\" said Ezra thoughtfully, \"then we have a feeling in common, I am also engaged.\" Stewart laughed gaily. \"And we both think our lady-loves perfect,\" he said lightly. \"\u0027Dulcinea is the fairest woman in the world,\u0027--poor Don Quixote.\" \"Mine is to me,\" said Ezra emphatically. \"Of course,\" answered Stewart, with a smile. \"I can picture her, tall, dark, and stately, an imperial daughter of Judah, with the beauty of Bathsheba and the majesty of Esther.\" \"Entirely wrong,\" replied Lazarus dryly, \"she is neither tall, dark, nor stately, but--\" \"The exact opposite--I take your meaning,\" said Keith composedly; \"well, my Dulcinea is like the sketch I have given--beautiful, clever, poor, and--a governess.\" \"And you haven\u0027t seen her for a year?\" \"No--a whole twelvemonth--she is up Sandhurst way trying to hammer dates and the rule of three into the thick heads of five small brats, and I--well I\u0027m an unsuccessful literary man, doing what is vulgarly known as \u0027a perish.\u0027\" \"What made you take up writing?\" asked Lazarus. \"What made me take up writing?\" repeated Stewart, staring vaguely into the fire. \"Lord knows--destiny, I suppose--I\u0027ve had a queer sort of life altogether. I was born of poor but honest parents, quite the orthodox style of thing, isn\u0027t it?\" \"Are your parents alive?\" \"Dead!\" laconically. There was a pause of a few moments, during which time Keith was evidently deep in thought. \"According to Sir Walter Scott,\" he observed at length, \"every Scotchman has a pedigree. I\u0027ve got one as long as the tail of a kite, only not so useful. I\u0027d sell all my ancestors, as readily as Charles Surface did his, for a few pounds. My people claim to be connected with the royal Stewarts.\" \"Your name is spelt differently.\" \"It\u0027s spelt correctly,\" retorted Keith coolly, \"in the good old Scottish fashion; as for the other, it\u0027s the French method acclimatised by Mary Stuart when she married the Dauphin of France.\" \"Well, now I know your pedigree, what is the story of your life?\" \"My life?--oh! I\u0027m like Canning\u0027s knife-grinder. \u0027Story, I\u0027ve got none to tell.\u0027 My father and mother found royal descent was not bread and butter, so they sold the paternal acres and came out to Australia, where I was born. The gold fever was raging then, but I suppose they inherited the bad luck of the Stewarts, for they did not make a penny; then they started a farm in Gippsland and ruined themselves. My father died of a broken heart, and my mother soon followed, so I was left an orphan with next to nothing. I wandered all over Australia, and did anything that turned up. Suppressing the family pride, I took a situation in a Sandhurst store, kept by a man called Proggins, and there I met Eugénie Rainsford, who, as I told you, taught the juvenile Progginses. I had a desultory sort of education from my father, and having read a good deal, I determined to take to literature, inspired, I suppose, by the poetic melancholy of the Australian bush. I wrote poetry with the usual success; I then went on the stage, and found I wasn\u0027t a heaven-born genius by any means, so I became a member of the staff of a small country paper, wrote brilliant articles about the weather and crops, varied by paste-and-scissors\u0027 work. Burned the midnight oil, and wrote some articles, which were accepted in Melbourne, so, with the usual prudence of genius, I threw up my billet and came down here to set the Thames, or rather the Yarra, on fire. Needless to remark, I didn\u0027t succeed or I shouldn\u0027t be here, so there is my history in a nutshell.\" \"And Miss Rainsford?\" \"Oh, I engaged myself to her before I left Sandhurst,\" said Keith, his face growing tender, \"bless her--the letters she has written me have been my bulwark against despair--ah! what a poor devil a man is in this world without a good woman\u0027s love to comfort him.\" \"Are you doing anything now?\" said Ezra thoughtfully. \"Nothing. I\u0027m leading a hand-to-mouth, here-to-day-gone-to-morrow existence. I\u0027m a vagabond on the face of the earth, a modern Cain, Bonnie Prince Charlie in exile--the infernal luck of my royal ancestors still sticks to me, but, ah, bah!\" shrugging his shoulders, \"don\u0027t let\u0027s talk any more, old chap, we can resume the subject to-morrow, meanwhile play me something. I\u0027m in a poetic mood, and would like to build castles in the air.\" Ezra laughed, and, turning to the piano, began to play one of Henselt\u0027s morceaux, a pathetic, dreamy melody, which came stealing softly through the room, and filled the soul of the young man with vague yearnings. Staring idly into the heart of the burning coals, he saw amid the bluish flames and red glimmer of the fire a vision of the dear dead days of long ago--shadows appeared, the shadows of last year. A glowing sunset, bathing a wide plain in delicate crimson hues; a white gate leading to a garden bright with flowers, and over the gate the shadow of a beautiful woman stood talking to the shadow of a man--himself. Mnenosyne--saddest of deities--waved her wand, and the shadows talked. \"And when will you come back, Keith?\" asked the girl shadow. \"When I am a great man,\" replied the other shadow proudly. \"I am riding forth like Poe\u0027s knight in search of El Dorado.\" \"El Dorado is far away,\" returned the sweet voice of the girl; \"it is the Holy Grail of wealth, and can never be discovered.\" \"I will find it,\" replied the man shadow hopefully. \"Meanwhile, you will wait and hope.\" \"I will wait and hope,\" replied the girl, smiling sadly; and the shadows parted. The rain beat steadily against the panes, the soft music stole through the room, and Stewart, with idle gaze, stared into the burning heart of the fire, as if he expected to find there the El Dorado of his dreams.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1861/53880.html","bookId":829,"book":{"id":829,"title":"Miss Mephistopheles","description":"简介： A wet Sunday--dreary, dismal, and infinitely sloppy.
