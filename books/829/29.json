{"id":11676,"no":29,"title":"CHAPTER XXIX. LIGHT AT LAST.","content":"It was certainly a remarkable thing that when Kitty had prepared her trap for Fenton just on the eve of his going away, by having Naball in hiding to arrest him, that Malton, the only man who could effectually accuse the American, should also have come down to Toorak in the nick of time. But, then, coincidences do happen in real life as well as in novels; and had Kitty carefully constructed the whole scene with an eye to dramatic effect, it could hardly have turned out better. Eugénie sat with the actress in the drawing-room, waiting for the arrival of Fenton, and talking to Naball, who was seated near them. The detective had listened to all with the keenest interest, but, much to Kitty\u0027s disgust, seemed doubtful of the American\u0027s guilt. \"You were quick enough in accusing other people,\" she said angrily, \"myself among the number, and now, when I show you plain proof, you disbelieve.\" \"I don\u0027t think the proof is strong enough, that\u0027s all,\" replied Naball drily. \"We have only the word of a child that she picked up the link in the bedroom.\" \"Meg never tells falsehoods,\" interposed Eugénie quickly. \"I daresay not,\" he replied coolly. \"However, Fenton may have lost this link before.\" \"No, he didn\u0027t,\" said Caprice decisively. \"He had the links on when he was at supper. I saw them, and I ought to know, because I gave them to him myself.\" \"But why should Fenton steal your diamonds? He\u0027s got lots of money,\" argued Naball, who was rather annoyed at Kitty finding out more than he had. \"I don\u0027t know why he should,\" retorted the actress; \"it\u0027s not my business or yours to discover motives--all I know is, he did it, and I\u0027m going to have him arrested.\" \"Perhaps he\u0027ll be suspicious, and won\u0027t come.\" \"Oh yes, he will. He thinks I believe Stewart to be the thief, and as to coming, I can whistle him back at any moment. Hark!\" as a ring came at the door. \"There he is; get behind that screen. Miss Rainsford, you go into the next room till I call.\" Naball promptly did as he was told, so did Eugénie, and when Fenton entered the room, he only found Kitty, calmly seated beside a little table, reading a book. Fenton was looking wonderfully well, but with a watchful look on his face, as if he feared discovery. He had a good sum of money with him, his passage to Valparaiso, and never for a moment thought that he was on the edge of an abyss. Of course, Kitty did not know he was about to abscond, and never thought how near her prey had escaped. She received him quietly, with friendly interest, and Fenton, pulling a chair next to hers, began to talk eagerly, never dreaming that an officer of the law was listening to every word. Not only that, but outside, crouching on the verandah, was a dark figure, with a livid face, listening to what the man inside was saying. Hiram Fenton, utterly unconscious, was surrounded on all sides by his enemies, and went on telling all his plans to Kitty, never thinking how near he was to the felon\u0027s dock from which he was flying. \"And what did you want to see me about!\" asked Fenton, taking Caprice\u0027s hand. \"Nothing in particular,\" she replied carelessly; \"the fact is, I haven\u0027t seen you for such a long time.\" \"Then you do care for me a little?\" Caprice shrugged her shoulders. \"As much as I do for any man; but I didn\u0027t ask you to come here to make love. I want to talk seriously about giving up the stage.\" She was leading him on so that he should betray himself to the detective, and he walked straight into the trap. \"Oh, you\u0027re tired of acting,\" said Fenton thoughtfully. \"Yes; and of Melbourne. I want to go away.\" Fenton started, and wondered if she knew he was going away also. He thought for a moment, and then replied,-- \"Then, why not come with me?\" \"With you!\" cried Kitty derisively. \"What about Mrs. Malton?\" \"I tell you, I don\u0027t care two straws about Mrs. Malton,\" he rejoined angrily. \"I was only amusing myself with her.\" Amusing himself! The man outside ground his teeth together in anger, and clutched the packet of letters fiercely. \"And what about your dear friend--her husband?\" \"Oh, Malton,\" said Fenton carelessly. \"I don\u0027t know, nor do I care; he was a very useful man to me for a time. But, now, I\u0027m off.\" \"Off!--where?\" \"To Valparaiso. Yes, I\u0027m sick of Australia, so I sail to-morrow morning for South America. Will you come with me, Kitty?\" Kitty looked doubtful. \"I don\u0027t know. We have no money.\" \"I have plenty. I\u0027ve arranged all that, and if there\u0027s a row, my dear friend Malton will have to bear it. But now, Kitty, I\u0027ve told you all, you must come with me. We can live a delightful life in South America. I know it well, and some of the places are Paradises. Come, say you\u0027ll come to-night.\" He put his arms round her, and pressed a kiss on her lips. She shuddered at the impure caress, then pushing him away, arose to her feet. \"Don\u0027t touch me,\" she said harshly, \"you--you thief!\" In a moment Fenton was on his feet, with an apprehensive look on his face. \"Thief! thief!\" he cried fiercely; \"what do you mean?\" \"Mean,\" she said, turning on him like a tiger, \"that I know now who stole my diamonds, Mr. Hiram Fenton.\" \"Do you accuse me?\" he asked, with a pale face, gripping her wrist. \"Yes, I do,\" said Kitty, wrenching her wrist away, \"and I\u0027ve got a proof--this broken sleeve-link, dropped by you in my room on the night of the robbery.\" \"It\u0027s a lie!\" \"It\u0027s true! I accuse you of stealing my diamonds. Detective Naball, arrest that man.\" Fenton started as Naball stepped out from behind the screen, and then folded his arms, with an evil smile. \"So!\" he said coolly, \"this is a trap, I see; but I\u0027m not to be caught in it. You say I stole your diamonds?\" \"I do,\" said Kitty boldly. \"And your proof is that you picked up a broken sleeve-link?\" \"Yes.\" \"Then, Mr. Detective,\" said Fenton, holding out both his wrists to Naball, \"if you examine these, you will see neither of the links are broken.\" Naball, with an ejaculation of surprise, examined both the links, and found what he said was correct--neither of the sleeve-links were broken. \"Have you not made a mistake?\" he said to Caprice. \"No, I have not,\" she replied coolly. \"When he found he had lost a sleeve-link, he got another made, in order to avert suspicion. I say Hiram Fenton stole my diamonds, and I give him in charge.\" Naball stepped forward, but the American, who was now uneasy at the turn affairs had taken, waved him back. \"Wait a moment,\" he said quickly; \"I deny the charge, and will prove it false to-morrow.\" Kitty laughed derisively. \"By which time you will be on your way to Valparaiso. No, I\u0027m not going to let you go.\" \"Neither am I,\" said Naball decisively. \"I arrest you on this charge of robbery now,\" and he laid his hand on the shoulder of the American. In a moment Fenton twisted himself away, and dexterously throwing Naball on the ground, darted towards one of the French windows. \"Not so fast, my friend,\" he said sneeringly, while Naball, half-stunned, was picking himself up; \"guess I\u0027ll beat you this time. I care nothing for you nor that she-devil there. You can prove nothing.\" Naball made a bound forward, but with a mocking laugh Fenton was about to step lightly through the window, when he was dashed violently back into Naball\u0027s arms, and Malton, pale as death sprang into the room. \"Hold him,\" he cried, clutching Fenton, who was too much astonished to make any resistance. \"Don\u0027t let him go. He\u0027s guilty--I can prove it.\" Eugénie had hurried into the room, attracted by the noise, and Kitty was standing near her, the two women clinging together for protection. Naball held Fenton firmly, while Malton, in a frenzy of rage, spoke rapidly. \"He is guilty of the robbery,\" he shrieked, menacing Fenton with his fists. \"He embezzled money with me, and had it been found out, we would both have been put in prison. He stole the diamonds on the night of the supper, by going upstairs to your room, and then leaving by the window, so as to make people think it was a burglary.\" \"A cursed lie!\" growled Fenton, making an effort to shake Naball off. \"No, it isn\u0027t,\" cried Malton furiously. \"Villiers can prove it. You met him as you were coming round the house, and gave him some diamonds to make him hold his tongue.\" \"Oh, the crescent!\" cried Naball. \"Yes, yes; and then he sold the diamonds to old Lazarus, and afterwards murdered him. Yes, he killed Jacob Lazarus!\" Fenton\u0027s nostrils dilated, he drew a deep breath, and gave a cry of anger; but Malton went on speaking rapidly. \"I got that note not from Ezra Lazarus, but from Fenton, and lied to shield him; but now, when I find out he makes love to my wife, I\u0027ll do anything to hang him. See, these letters--your cursed letters,\" flinging them on the ground before Fenton. \"You liar, thief, murderer, you\u0027re done for at last!\" \"Not yet!\" yelled Fenton, and with a sudden effort he flung Naball off, and dashed for the window, but Malton sprang on him like a wild cat, and they both rolled on the floor. Naball jumped up, and went to Malton\u0027s help, when suddenly the American, with a supreme effort, wrenched himself clear of them, and ran once more for the window. Seeing this, Kitty, who had remained a passive spectator, tried to stop him, but with an oath he hurled her from him, and she, falling against a table, knocked it over, and fell senseless on the ground. Fenton, with a cry of anger, dashed through the window, and disappeared into the darkness. But, quick as he was, Malton was quicker; for seeing his enemy escape him, he also sprang through the window, and gave chase. Naball, breathless, and covered in blood, was about to go also, when a cry from Eugénie stopped him. The girl was kneeling down beside Kitty, while the frightened servants crowded in at the door. \"Oh, she is dead I dead!\" cried Eugénie, looking down at the still face. \"No; she can\u0027t be. Brandy--bring some brandy!\" A servant entered with the brandy, and Eugénie, filling a glass, forced some of the liquid between Kitty\u0027s clenched teeth. Naball also took a glass, as he was worn-out with the struggle, then, hastily putting on his hat, went out, leaving Kitty lying, to all appearances dead, in Eugénie\u0027s arms. Meanwhile, Malton was close on the heels of the American, who had cleared out by the gate, and was making for the railway station. There were few people about; but the spectacle of two men racing bare-headed soon brought a crowd around. Fenton, with deep curses, sped on through the driving rain, and at last flew on to the platform, followed by Malton, who gasped out,-- \"Seize him! Murderer! murderer!\" The station-master, a porter, and some passengers who were waiting, all sprang forward at this; so Fenton, seeing himself surrounded, gave one yell of rage, and, jumping on the line, ran along. \"My God!\" cried the station-master, \"the train is coming down; he will be killed.\" He tried to hold Malton, who was mad with anger at seeing his prey escape him, and, foaming with anger, wrenched himself away. \"You\u0027ll be killed!\" cried the porter; but Malton, with a hoarse cry, sprang on to the line, and sped after Fenton through the driving rain. It was pitch dark, and the rain swept along in slanting sheets, through which gleamed the red and green of the signals. Malton, only actuated by a mad desire to seize Fenton, staggered blindly over the sleepers, stumbling at every step. Suddenly he heard the hard breathing of the man he was pursuing, and the foremost figure loomed up dark and misshapen in the thick night. They were now near the railway bridge which crosses the Yarra-Yarra at this point, and the steady sweep of the river could be heard as it flowed against the iron girders. Fenton, hearing some one close behind him, made a bound forwards, then fell on the line, with a shriek of despair. In a moment Malton was on him, and the two men rolled on the line, fighting like devils. \"Curse you!\" hissed Malton, putting his knee on Fenton\u0027s chest, \"I\u0027ll kill you!--I\u0027ll kill you!\" And he dashed Fenton\u0027s head against the iron rails. The American, in despair, flung up his hands, and caught Malton round the neck. Once more they fought, wrapped in a deadly embrace, when suddenly they felt the bridge vibrate, and, even in their struggle, saw rapidly approaching, through the darkness the light of the down train. Malton, with a cry of horror, tried to release himself from Fenton\u0027s grip, but the American held him tight, and in another moment the train, with a roar, was on the bridge, and over their bodies. One hoarse yell, and all was over. Evan Malton and Hiram Fenton were torn to pieces under the cruel wheels.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1861/53908.html","bookId":829,"book":{"id":829,"title":"Miss Mephistopheles","description":"简介： A wet Sunday--dreary, dismal, and infinitely sloppy.
