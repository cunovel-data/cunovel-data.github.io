{"id":11671,"no":24,"title":"CHAPTER XXIV. WHAT KITTY KNEW.","content":"The trio soon arrived at Kitty\u0027s house, and Ezra was just about to ring the front-door bell, when suddenly Naball touched his arm to stop him. \"Hist!\" he said in a quick whisper; \"listen.\" A woman\u0027s voice, talking in a high key, and then the deep tones of a man\u0027s voice, like the growl of an angry beast. \"What did I tell you?\" whispered Naball again. \"Villiers and Caprice, both in the drawing-room; wait a moment, count twenty, and then ring the bell.\" He stepped round the corner of the porch, stepped stealthily on to the verandah, and then stole softly towards one of the French windows in order to listen. He was correct in his surmise; the two speakers were Kitty Marchurst and Randolph Villiers. \"You\u0027d better give me what I ask,\" growled Villiers in a threatening tone, \"or I\u0027ll go straight and tell how you were at Lazarus\u0027s on the night of the murder.\" \"Perhaps you\u0027ll tell I killed him?\" said Caprice, with a sneer. \"Perhaps I will,\" retorted Villiers; \"there\u0027s no knowing.\" \"There\u0027s this much knowing,\" said Kitty deliberately, \"that I won\u0027t give you a single penny. If I am called on to explain my movements, I can\u0027t do so; but it will be the worse for you, it will place--\" At this moment the bell rang, and Caprice started in alarm. \"Hush,\" she cried, advancing towards Villiers; \"come to me again. I must not be seen talking with you here. Go away--not by the door,\" she said, with an angry stamp of her foot as Villiers went towards the door; \"by the window--no one will see you.\" Villiers moved towards the French window, opened it, and was just about to step out when Naball stepped forward. \"I\u0027m afraid some one will,\" he said serenely, pushing Villiers back into the room, and closing the window. \"Naball!\" cried Kitty and Villiers in a breath. \"Exactly,\" replied that gentleman, taking a chair. \"I\u0027ve come to have a talk with you both.\" \"How dare you force your way into my house?\" cried Kitty angrily, while Villiers stood looking sullenly at the detective. \"It\u0027s about the diamond robbery,\" went on Naball, as if he never heard her. \"Leave the house,\" she cried, stamping her foot. \"And about the murder,\" he finished off, looking from one to the other. Kitty glanced at Villiers, who looked at her with a scowl, and sank into a chair. Just as he did so, the drawing-room door opened, and Eugénie entered, followed by Ezra Lazarus. \"I don\u0027t understand the meaning of all this,\" said Caprice, with a sneer; \"but you seem to have a good idea of dramatic effect.\" \"Perhaps so,\" replied Naball lazily. Kitty shrugged her shoulders and turned to Eugénie. \"Perhaps you can explain all this, Miss Rainsford?\" she said coolly. \"Yes,\" answered Eugénie slowly; \"it\u0027s about Mr. Stewart. You know he has been arrested for this murder?\" \"Know,\" repeated Kitty impatiently, \"of course, I know. I\u0027m sure I ought to--morn, noon and night I\u0027ve heard nothing else. I don\u0027t know how it will affect the piece, I\u0027m sure.\" \"Never mind the piece,\" said Ezra, a trifle sternly. \"I don\u0027t mind that, as long as I save my friend.\" \"I hope you will,\" said Caprice heartily. \"I am certain he never committed the crime. What do you say?\" turning to the detective. \"I\u0027m beginning to be of your opinion,\" replied Naball candidly. \"I did think him guilty once,\" fixing his eyes on Villiers, \"but now I don\u0027t.\" \"What about the knife I gave you?\" asked Villiers abruptly. \"Ah!\" said Naball musingly, \"what, indeed.\" \"I found it on the scene of the crime,\" said Villiers in a defiant manner. \"So you said.\" \"Don\u0027t you believe me?\" \"Humph!\" At this ambiguous murmur Villiers gave a savage growl, and would have replied, but Kitty stopped him by waving her hand. \"It\u0027s no good talking like this,\" she said quickly. \"There is some reason for you all coming here; what is it?\" \"I\u0027ll tell you,\" said Naball in a sharp official tone. \"Do you remember the diamond robbery at this place? Well, those diamonds were sold to old Lazarus, and he sent them to Amsterdam for sale. The person who stole those diamonds thought they were still in the safe of Jacob Lazarus; and the person who stole those diamonds murdered Jacob Lazarus to recover them.\" He finished triumphantly, and then waited to see what effect his accusation would have on Kitty. To his astonishment, however, she never moved a muscle of her face, but asked calmly,-- \"And who is the thief and the murderer?\" \"That\u0027s what I want to find out.\" \"Naturally; but why come to me?\" \"Because, you know.\" \"I!\" she cried, rising to her feet in anger. \"I know nothing.\" \"Yes, you do, and so does Villiers there,\" persisted Naball. Villiers glanced strangely at Kitty, and growled sullenly. \"Now, look here Miss Marchurst,\" said Naball rapidly, \"it\u0027s no use beating about the bush--I know more than you think. You denied that you stole your own jewels, but I know you did, in order to pay the money embezzled by Malton. Lazarus\u0027s boy saw you go to his place during the week of the robbery, late at night. You did so in order to dispose of the jewels. The crescent I took from Villiers down Bourke Street was given to him by you as an accomplice; and I listened at that window to-day and heard Villiers say you were on the Russell Street premises on the night of the murder. Now, what do you say?\" Kitty, still on her feet, was deadly pale, but looked rapidly at Naball. \"You have made up a very clever case,\" she said quietly; \"but entirely wrong--yes, entirely. I did not take my own jewels, as I told you before, therefore I was unable to pay the money for Mr. Malton. I did go to see Lazarus one night during the week of the robbery, in order to get some money, but was unable to do so. I never gave the crescent to Villiers, as he will tell you; and lastly, as you overheard him state, I was at Lazarus\u0027s on the night of the murder, but did not think it necessary to state so. I went there after I left the Bon-Bon, and made no secret of my doing so, as my coachman can inform you. I found the door locked, and no light inside, so thinking the old man had gone to bed, I came away, and went home; so, you see, your very clever case means nothing.\" \"Is this true?\" asked Naball, turning to Villiers. \"Is what true?\" asked that gentleman angrily. \"What she says.\" \"Some of it. Well, yes, most of it.\" \"You\u0027d better go a little further,\" said Kitty quietly, \"and say all of it. Did I give you the diamond crescent?\" \"No, you didn\u0027t.\" \"Then, who did?\" asked Naball pertinaciously. \"I sha\u0027n\u0027t tell you,\" growled Villiers. \"Oh, yes, you will,\" said the detective, \"because if you know who stole the diamonds, you know the murderer of Lazarus.\" \"No, I don\u0027t,\" retorted Villiers savagely. \"I tell you I saw her round about the place on that night, and I picked up the knife I gave you; that\u0027s all I know.\" \"Humph! we\u0027ll see about that.\" \"You are sure that the person who stole the diamonds committed the crime?\" asked Caprice, with a strange smile on her pale lips. \"Well, I\u0027m pretty sure; it looks uncommon like it.\" \"And you think I stole the diamonds?\" \"Yes,\" retorted Naball bluntly; \"I believe you did.\" \"In that case, by your own reasoning, I\u0027m a murderess,\" said Caprice. \"I don\u0027t say that,\" said the detective; \"but I believe you know who did it,\" looking significantly at Villiers. \"I\u0027m afraid your reasonings and your assertions are at variance,\" said Kitty quietly. \"I don\u0027t know who committed the murder, but I do know who stole my diamonds.\" \"Who?\" asked Ezra, in an excited tone. \"Keith Stewart!\" \"Keith Stewart!\" echoed all; \"impossible!\" Eugénie stepped forward with a frown on her pale face, and looked at Kitty. \"I don\u0027t believe it,\" she said, \"and you are a wicked woman to say so.\" \"Unfortunately, it\u0027s true,\" replied Caprice, with a sigh. \"I have kept the secret as long as I could, but now it\u0027s impossible to do so any longer. Keith Stewart was at my place on the night of the robbery, and heard me say where my diamonds were. He was coming to the drawing-room, and saw my child descending the stairs, having got out of bed. He picked her up, and put her in bed again. The temptation was too strong to resist, I suppose, and he opened the drawer of the mirror, and took the jewels. He then got out of the window, and came round by the front of the house so as to enter by the front-door. Meg was awake all the time, and told it to me in her childish way, how he had gone to the window and got out of it. I told her not to speak of it, and kept silence.\" \"Why did you keep silence?\" asked Naball. \"Why,\" cried Kitty, her face flushing with anger, \"because he saved my child from death. He might have stolen anything of mine, but I would have kept silent, nor would I have betrayed him now but that you accuse me of murder.\" There was a dead silence in the room, as every one was touched by the way in which Kitty spoke. Then Villiers gave a coarse laugh. \"Ha! ha!\" he said harshly; \"you said, Naball, that the person who stole the diamonds committed the murder also, so you\u0027ve got the right man in gaol.\" Naball cast a look of commiseration at Eugénie, and said nothing. \"Wait a moment,\" cried Ezra, stepping forward, \"we\u0027ve got to find the stolen bank-notes first. I don\u0027t believe Keith Stewart committed such a base crime; he is no murderer.\" \"No,\" cried Eugénie, springing to her feet; \"nor is he a thief. I will prove his innocence.\" \"I\u0027m afraid that\u0027s difficult,\" said Naball reflectively; \"things look black against him.\" \"Of course they do,\" said Villiers coarsely. \"Who knows he is innocent?\" Eugénie stepped in front of the ruffian, and raised her hand to the ceiling. \"There is One who knows he is innocent--God.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1861/53903.html","bookId":829,"book":{"id":829,"title":"Miss Mephistopheles","description":"简介： A wet Sunday--dreary, dismal, and infinitely sloppy.
