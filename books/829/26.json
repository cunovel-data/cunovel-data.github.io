{"id":11673,"no":26,"title":"CHAPTER XXVI. ON THE TRACK.","content":"When Eugénie left the prison, she went straight to Naball\u0027s office, and finding him in, told all about the wonderful discovery of the veritable five-pound note endorsed in Isaiah\u0027s writing. To say that Naball was astonished would be a mild way to state his feelings on receipt of this intelligence. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s an uncommon piece of luck,\" he said, looking at the note; \"we might have searched for a twelvemonth, and never come across this piece of evidence. I think we\u0027ll get to the bottom of things this time. You got it from Kitty Marchurst?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, I got it yesterday in payment of my salary\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Naball whistled softly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Things look uncommon black against that young woman,\" he observed thoughtfully. \"I didn\u0027t half believe that story of hers about Stewart\u0027s stealing the diamonds, and now this note turning up in her possession--humph!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But you don\u0027t think she\u0027s guilty?\" said Eugénie, clasping her hands. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t say anything,\" replied Naball savagely, for the difficulties of this case were beginning to irritate him. \"I only say things look black against Caprice--she\u0027s as deep as a well.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What are you going to do now?\" asked Miss Rainsford in a trembling voice, as she rose to go. \\n\\n \\n\\n The detective placed his hat jauntily on one side of his head, drew on his gloves, then taking his cane, walked to the door of the office, which he he held open for Eugénie to pass through. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What are you going to do now?\" she repeated when they were standing in the street. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m going down to Toorak,\" said Naball quietly, \"to trace this note, beginning with Kitty Marchurst as the last holder of it; she\u0027ll tell lies, but whether she does or not, I\u0027ll get to the bottom of this affair. Good-day, Miss Rainsford,\" and taking off his hat with a flourish, he left her abruptly, and strolled leisurely down the street. \\n\\n \\n\\n Eugénie watched him with eager eyes until he was out of sight, and then turned round to walk home. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, my dear! my dear!\" she murmured, \"if I can only save you from this terrible danger--but not at the cost of that poor woman\u0027s life--oh, not that!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The detective, on his way down to Toorak, went over the case in his own mind, in order to see against whom the evidence was strongest. At last, after considerable cogitation, he came to the conclusion that, after all, Villiers must be the guilty man, and that Kitty knew more about the crime than she chose to tell. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I can\u0027t get over Villiers having had that diamond crescent,\" he thought, looking out of the carriage windows. \"She denied it was hers, and then Fenton told me he gave it to her. I wonder if he had anything to do with the affair--humph!--not likely. If she thought it was him, she\u0027d tell at once. Perhaps she really thinks Stewart stole the diamonds. Pish! I don\u0027t believe it. She\u0027s had a finger in the pie, whoever did it, and this murder is the outcome of the robbery. Well, I\u0027ll see if she can account for her possession of this five-pound note--that\u0027s the main thing.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Kitty Marchurst was at home, and sent a message to the detective that she would see him in a few minutes, so Naball walked up and down the long drawing-room with some impatience. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If she\u0027ll only tell the truth,\" he muttered restlessly; \"but I\u0027m getting to doubt her, so that I can\u0027t be sure. There\u0027s one thing, Keith Stewart\u0027s fate rests entirely with her now, so if he saved her child\u0027s life, as she says he did, this is the time to prove her gratitude.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n At this moment the door opened, and Caprice entered. She looked pale and weary, for the trials of the last few months had not been endured without leaving some mark of their passage. Naball did not know whether this haggard-looking woman was guilty or innocent, but he could not help pitying her, so worn-out did she seem. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You are not well,\" he said when she seated herself. \\n\\n \\n\\n Kitty sighed wearily, and pushed the loose hair off her forehead. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No,\" she replied listlessly. \"I\u0027m getting worn-out over this trouble. It\u0027s no good my telling you anything, because you don\u0027t believe me. What is the matter now? Have you got further proof of my guilt?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" said Naball, coolly producing the five-pound note; \"unless you call this proof.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"A five-pound note,\" she said contemptuously. \"Well?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It is a five-pound note,\" explained Naball smoothly; \"but not an ordinary one--in fact, it is one of the notes stolen from Lazarus\u0027s safe.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, how do you know that? By a very curious thing. One of the notes placed in the safe on the night of the murder was endorsed by the office-boy with the words \u0027Back Flat-Iron,\u0027 and strange to say the endorsed note has turned up.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And that is it?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Exactly. Now, do you understand?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Kitty shrugged her shoulders. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I understand that you have secured an excellent piece of evidence, nothing more. Where did you get the note?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"From Miss Rainsford.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"From Miss Rainsford!\" repeated Kitty in surprise; \"but you surely don\u0027t suspect--\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, I don\u0027t,\" interposed the detective; \"because she was able to tell me where she got the note from.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, I presume she got it from me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes,\" replied Naball, rather surprised at this cool admission. \"She received it yesterday from you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh! then, you think I\u0027m guilty?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not if you can tell me where you got the note from.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Certainly I can--from Mortimer--paid to me the day before yesterday.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Your salary?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not exactly,\" answered Kitty; \"if it had been, you\u0027d never be able to trace the note further back. No; I was at the theatre in the morning, and found myself short of money, so I asked Mortimer for some. He gave me that five-pound note, and, as he took it, from his waistcoat pocket, I\u0027ve no doubt he\u0027ll be able to recollect from whom he received it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Because Mortimer doesn\u0027t carry fivers in his waistcoat pocket generally,\" said Caprice impatiently, \"so he must have put that note there for some special reason. You\u0027d better go and ask him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Certainly,\" said Naball, and arose to his feet. \"I\u0027m very much obliged to you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then you don\u0027t think me guilty?\" asked Kitty, with a smile. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Upon my word, I don\u0027t know what to think,\" said the detective dismally. \"The whole case seems mixed up. I\u0027ll tell you when I find the man who can\u0027t account for the possession of this fiver.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Kitty smiled, and then Naball took his leave, going straight from Toorak to the Bon-Bon Theatre, where he found Mortimer in his sanctum, up to the ears in business, as usual. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, Naball,\" said the manager, looking up sharply, \"what\u0027s up % Look sharp, I\u0027m awfully busy.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I only want to know where you got this?\" asked Naball, giving him the five-pound note. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mortimer took it up, and looked perplexed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How the deuce should I know; I get so many. Why do you want to know?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, nothing. I just want to trace the note. Caprice said you gave it to her the day before yesterday.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Eh! did I?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes. You took it from your waistcoat pocket.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Of course; to be sure, she wanted some money. Yes; I kept it apart because it was made money--won it off Malton at euchre.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Malton!\" repeated Naball in amazement; \"are you sure?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, quite. You know I\u0027m generally unlucky at cards, and this is about the first fiver I\u0027ve made, so I kept it just to bring me luck; but Caprice wanted money, so I handed over my luck to her. There\u0027s nothing wrong, eh?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, dear, no,\" replied Naball; \"not the slightest--only some professional business.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Because I shouldn\u0027t like to get any poor devil into a row,\" said Mortimer. \"Now, be off with you, I\u0027m busy. Good-day.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Good-day, good-day.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Naball departed, curiously perplexed in his feelings. He had never thought of Malton in the light of a possible criminal, and yet it was so very strange that this note should have been traced back to him. Then he remembered the conversation he had overheard between Mrs. Malton and Kitty concerning the embezzlement, when Kitty denied that she had paid the money. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"By Jove!\" said Naball, a sudden thought striking him, \"he was present at that supper, and was in a regular hole for want of money. I wouldn\u0027t be a bit surprised if he stole those diamonds to replace the money, and his wife\u0027s thanking Caprice was all a blind, and then this note--humph!--things look rather fishy, my friend.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n When he arrived at the Never-say-die Insurance Company Office, he sent in his card to the assistant manager, and in a few minutes was shown into Malton\u0027s room, where that individual received him with visible uneasiness. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, Naball, and what brings you here?\" he asked, watching the detective\u0027s face stealthily. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Only a little business, in which I want your help,\" said Naball, taking the note out of his pocket-book. \"Can you tell me where you got that?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Malton\u0027s pink-and-white complexion grew a little pale, but he laughed in a forced manner as he glanced at the note. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Got this?\" he said. \"I can\u0027t tell you. Was it ever in my possession?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It was,\" asserted Naball. \"You gave it to Mortimer the day before yesterday.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, yes, I remember now,\" said Malton quickly. \"He won it off me at cards.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Exactly. Where did you get the note?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Malton shifted uneasily in his seat, and his nether lip twitched uneasily. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m afraid I can hardly remember,\" he murmured, pushing back his chair. \\n\\n \\n\\n Naball\u0027s suspicions were now rapidly ripening to certainties. If Malton were innocent, why these signs of agitation? He wriggled and twisted about like an eel, yet never once met the keen eye of the detective. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027d better remember,\" said Naball mercilessly, \"or it will be the worse for you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why?\" asked Malton, trying to appear composed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Because,\" explained Naball, in a low voice, \"that note is one of those stolen by the man who murdered Jacob Lazarus.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Malton, with a smothered exclamation, started to his feet, and then, shaking in every limb, sat down again. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, no,\" he stammered, \"that\u0027s absurd. It can\u0027t be--I tell you, it can\u0027t be.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, but it can be, and it is. I tell you, the note is endorsed \u0027Back Flat-Iron,\u0027 which was done by the office-boy a few moments before the notes were put in the safe by Stewart. They were gone after the murder, so there is no doubt they were taken by the man who committed the crime. I got this note from Miss Rainsford, who received it from Caprice; she, in her turn, got it from Mortimer, and he has referred us to you. Now, where did you get it?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Malton drummed nervously on the table. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I can\u0027t tell you,\" he said in a tremulous voice. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You must.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s impossible.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I tell you what, sir,\" said Naball coolly, \"if you don\u0027t tell, it means trouble for you and the other man.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What other man?\" asked Malton shakily. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The man you got this note from.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Malton thought for a moment, and then apparently made up his mind. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You saw I was taken aback?\" he asked Naball curiously. \\n\\n \\n\\n The detective nodded. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s because I\u0027m sorry for what I have to tell you--the man I got the note from was Ezra Lazarus.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Naball jumped to his feet with a cry. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The dead man\u0027s son?\" he said. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes; the dead man\u0027s son,\" replied Malton slowly. \\n\\n \\n\\n Naball stood for a few minutes, then putting the note in his pocket-book, once more took up his hat, and moved to the door. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Where are you going?\" asked Malton, rising. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"To see Mr. Ezra Lazarus,\" said Naball, pausing a moment. \"In the meantime, till I have certain proof of his guilt, you hold your tongue.\" And he walked out, leaving Malton standing at his desk as if turned into stone. \\n\\n \\n\\n Naball, on his way to the newspaper office, rapidly ran over in his own mind all the details of the case against Ezra. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"His father wouldn\u0027t give him any money, and he wanted to get married to that girl; father and son had a quarrel on the day preceding the murder; he was at the Bon-Bon on that night, and took Caprice downstairs to her carriage; she gave him Stewart\u0027s coat to take back to him again; in that coat was the knife found by Villiers under the window; she left the theatre long before Stewart,--where did he go? to his office, or--good heavens! if it should turn out to be true--\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Ezra received him, looking rather knocked up, but his face, though pale, was quite placid, and Naball wondered how a man guilty of such a terrible crime as parricide could be so calm. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You look tired,\" he said, taking a seat. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I am tired,\" admitted Ezra wearily. \"I\u0027ve been busy with my father\u0027s affairs.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Humph!\" thought Naball; \"counting his gains, I suppose.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Any fresh development of the case?\" asked Ezra. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes,\" said Naball solemnly. \"I received this note to-day, and traced it back to Malton; he says it was given to him by you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Ezra examined the note with great interest, and on turning it over saw the fatal words endorsed. He looked up quickly to Naball. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"This is one of the notes that were stolen?\" he asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes,\" replied Naball; \"and Malton said it was given to him by you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"By me!\" repeated Ezra in amazement. \"How on earth could I come across this note?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s what I want to find out,\" said Naball. \\n\\n \\n\\n Ezra looked at him for a moment, then the whole situation seemed to burst on him, and with a stifled groan the unhappy young man fell back into his chair, burying his face in his hands. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Good God!\" he cried, \"you don\u0027t suspect me of killing my father?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If you are innocent, you can explain where you got the note.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I cannot--I cannot,\" cried Ezra feverishly. \"I had to pay some money to Malton, and did so last week. There were some five-pound notes among that money, but I cannot tell where this particular one came from.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Where did you get the money?\" asked Naball. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"From the Hibernian Bank.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, but if you had to pay Malton money, why did you not do so by cheque?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Because I wanted some money myself, and did not care about drawing two cheques, so I drew one, covering what I owed to him and a little over.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Humph!\" Naball thought a moment. \"You are sure of this?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes; it\u0027s the only way I can account for having the note. Whoever killed my father, must have paid it into the bank, and it came round to me by some fatality.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Where were you on the night of the murder?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"At the Bon-Bon Theatre.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Afterwards?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"At this office.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You can prove an alibi?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m afraid I can\u0027t. I was all alone.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Look here, Mr. Lazarus,\" said Naball in a kind tone, \"I must say things look black against you; but I\u0027m not satisfied yet about the real criminal. To-day is Saturday, so I\u0027ll go to the bank the first thing on Monday, and find out what I can. There\u0027s so many suspected of this business, that one more or less don\u0027t matter.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Ezra groaned. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You don\u0027t think I\u0027m guilty?\" he asked imploringly. \\n\\n \\n\\n Naball looked keenly at him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No; I believe you innocent,\" he replied abruptly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1861/53905.html","bookId":829,"book":{"id":829,"title":"Miss Mephistopheles","description":"简介： A wet Sunday--dreary, dismal, and infinitely sloppy.
