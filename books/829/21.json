{"id":11668,"no":21,"title":"CHAPTER XXI. A FIRST NIGHT AT THE BON-BON.","content":"\"Faust Upset\" had been put into rehearsal at once, and three weeks after the murder of Lazarus it was to be produced. Mortimer had hurried on the production of the burlesque with the uttermost speed, as \"Prince Carnival\" was now playing to empty houses. The Bon-Bon company were kept hard at work, and, what with rehearsals during the day, the performance of the opera-bouffe in the evening, and rehearsals afterwards till two in the morning, they were all pretty well worn-out. \n \n In spite of Kitty\u0027s indomitable spirit, she was looking haggard and ill, for the incessant work was beginning to tell on her system. The doctor told her plainly that she was killing herself, and that absolute rest was what she required; but in spite of those warnings she never gave herself a moment\u0027s peace. \n \n \"I don\u0027t care two straws if I die,\" she said recklessly to Dr. Chinston; \"I\u0027ve made arrangements for the future of my child, and there\u0027s nothing else for me to live for.\" \n \n She was determined to make the burlesque a success, and worked hard at rehearsals getting the author and composer to alter some things, and cut out others, making several valuable suggestions as to stage-management, and in every way doing her best. But though friendly towards Keith, yet he was conscious of a kind of reserve in her manner towards him, and thought it was due to the knowledge that he was engaged to Eugénie. \n \n He had become reconciled to his sweetheart, and she went down every day to teach Meg at Toorak. It had been arranged that in three months she was to go to England with Meg, and Kitty guaranteed to pay a certain sum annually for the salary of the governess and the maintenance of the child. Of course Eugénie never meant to take any money, as she had become strongly attached to Meg, but still kept up her semblance of poverty till such time as she judged it fit to tell Keith. Meanwhile, in spite of Keith\u0027s opposition, she lived with Caprice, and led a very quiet life, for what with the state of her health and constant rehearsals, Kitty gave no Sunday receptions. \n \n But while Stewart fumed and fretted over the fact of his sweetheart staying with a woman of bad character like Caprice, and attended to all the rehearsals of the burlesque, Naball was silently winding his net round him. The detective had made inquiries at the Skylarks\u0027 Club, and found that Keith had been there on that night, in the company of Fenton. On discovering this, he went to Fenton and discovered that Stewart had lent the American the knife with which the crime had been committed, to cut the wires of a champagne bottle, and afterwards slipped it into his coat pocket. From the club he went to the Bon-Bon Theatre, and, as the detective knew from Keith\u0027s own admission, had left there at half-past twelve. \n \n \"And then,\" said Naball to himself, \"he told me he wandered about the streets till two o\u0027clock, and then saw Villiers--rubbish--he went straight to Russell Street and committed the crime.\" \n \n It had taken Naball some time to collect the necessary evidence, and it was only on the day previous to the production of \"Faust Upset\" that he was able to get a warrant for Keith\u0027s arrest, so he determined to let the performance take place before he arrested him. \n \n \"If it\u0027s a success,\" said Naball to himself, as he slipped the warrant in his pocket, \"he\u0027ll have had one jolly hour to himself, and if it\u0027s a failure--well, he\u0027ll be glad enough to go to gaol.\" So, with this philosophical conclusion, Mr. Naball settled in his own mind that he would go to the theatre. \n \n Keith wanted Eugénie to go to a box with him in order to see the play, but she said she would rather go to the stalls by herself, in order to judge of the effect the burlesque had on the audience. After a good deal of argument, Stewart gave way; so on the momentous night she took her seat in the stalls, eager to see the first bid her lover made for fame. \n \n Tulch had been recalled from his task of watching Stewart, as Naball judged that the vanity of an author seeing his work on the stage would be enough to keep the young man in Melbourne; but Tulch, true to his instincts of finishing a job properly, took his place in the gallery and kept his eye on Keith, who sat with Ezra in a private box. The Jew was calm and placid, as having succeeded to his father\u0027s fortune, he had not staked everything, like Keith, on the burlesque being a success; still, for his partner\u0027s sake as well as his own, he was anxious that it should go well. \n \n Such a crowded house as it was--everybody in Melbourne was there--for a new play by a colonial author was a rare thing, and a burlesque by a colonial author, with original music by a colonial composer, was almost unheard of. \n \n The critics who were present felt an unwonted sense of responsibility to-night, for as this was the first production of the piece on any stage, they had to give an opinion on their own responsibility. Hitherto the generality of plays produced in Melbourne had their good and bad points settled long before by London critics, so it was comparatively easy to give a verdict; but to-night it was quite a different thing, therefore the gentlemen of the press intended to be extra careful in their remarks. \n \n Although \"Faust Upset\" was called a burlesque, it was more of an opera-bouffe, as there was an absence of puns and rhyme about the dialogue, besides which, the lyrics were really cleverly written, and the music brisk and sparkling. Keith had taken the old medi?val legend of Faust, and reversed it entirely--all the male characters of the story he made female, and vice versa. There was a good deal of satire in the piece about the higher education of women, and the devotion of young men to athletics, to the exclusion of brain work. In fact, the libretto was of a decidedly Gilbertian flavour, albeit rather more frivolous, while the music was entirely of the Offenbachian school, light, tuneful and rapid. \n \n After a medley overture, containing a number of taking melodies in the piece, the curtain rose on the study of Miss Faust, a blue-stocking of the deepest dye, who, after devoting her life to acquiring knowledge, finds herself, at the age of fifty, an old maid with no one to care for her. The character was played by Toltby, who was a genuine humorist; and he succeeded in making a great deal out of the part, without ever condescending to vulgarity. His appearance as a lank, long maiden, in a dingy sage-green gown, with wan face and tousled hair, was ludicrous in the extreme. \n \n The opening chorus was sung by a number of pretty girls, in caps and gowns, and on their going out to meet their lovers, Miss Faust, overcome with loneliness, summons to her aid the powers of evil, and in response \"Miss Mephistopheles\" appears. \n \n Kitty looked charming as she stood in the centre of the red limelight. She was arrayed in the traditional dress of red, but as a female demon wore a petticoat, and her face was also left untouched. Miss Faust fainted in her chair, and Miss Mephistopheles, with a bright light in her eyes, and a reckless devil may-care look on her expressive face, whirled down to the footlights, and dashed into a rattling galop song, \"Yes, this is I,\" which melody ran all through the opera. \n \n With the assistance of various cosmetics, new dress, and sundry other articles of feminine toilet, which were brought in by a number of small imps, Miss Mephistopheles succeeds in making Miss Faust young; shows her a vision of Mr. Marguerite, a young athlete; and finally changes the scene to the market-place, where there was a chorus of young men in praise of athletic sports. \n \n It would be useless to give the plot in detail, as Keith followed the lines of the legend pretty closely. Miss Faust meets Mr. Marguerite, who is beloved by Miss Siebel, a sporting young woman. There was the garden scene, with a lawn tennis ground; a vision on the Brocken, of the future of women, with grotesque ballets and fantastic dresses; the scene of the duel, which was a quarrel scene between Mrs. Valentine and Miss Faust, after the style of Madame Angot; then Miss Mephistopheles runs off with Mr. Marguerite, having fallen in love with him; the lovers are followed and thrown into a prison, which is changed by the magic power of Miss Mephistopheles to a race-course, in which scene there is a bewildering array of betting men, pugilists, pretty girls, and fortune-tellers. Miss Mephistopheles then resigns Mr. Marguerite to Miss Siebel, and wants to carry off Miss Faust to the nether regions, when a flaw is discovered in the deed, and everything is settled amicably, the whole play ending with the galop chorus of the first number. \n \n When the curtain fell on the first act, the audience were somewhat bewildered; it was such an entirely new departure from the story of Faust, that they almost resented it. But as the piece progressed, they saw the real cleverness of the satire, and when the curtain came down they called loudly for the author and composer, who came forward and bowed their acknowledgments. \n \n When Mortimer heard the eulogies lavished on the piece, he drew a long breath of relief. \n \n \"Jove! I thought it was going to fail,\" he said, \"and I believe it would have, if Caprice hadn\u0027t pulled it out of the fire.\" \n \n And, indeed, Caprice, with her wonderful spirits and reckless abandon. had carried the whole play with her, and saved it at the most critical moment, A young man sitting near Eugénie summed up his idea of the piece in a few words. \n \n \"It\u0027s a deuced clever play,\" he said; \"but Caprice makes it go--if any one else plays her part, the theatre will be empty.\" \n \n Eugénie turned angrily to look for the author of this remark, but could not see him. Just as she was turning away, a shrill voice near her said,-- \n \n \"Ain\u0027t Caprice a stunner! I\u0027ve seen \u0027er lots of times at old Lazarus\u0027s.\" \n \n The speaker was a small, white-faced Jewish youth, being none other than Isaiah. \n \n Miss Rainsford pondered over these words as she walked out of the theatre. \n \n \"Goes to old Lazarus\u0027s,\" she said to herself; \"that was the old man who was killed. I wonder why she went there.\" \n \n There was a crowd in the vestibule of the theatre, and she saw Keith standing in the corner, looking as pale as death, talking to a man. \n \n She went up to congratulate him on the success of the performance, but something in his face made her afraid. \n \n \"What\u0027s the matter, Keith?\" she asked, touching him. \n \n \"Hush!\" he said in a hoarse whisper, \"don\u0027t say a word--I\u0027m arrested.\" \n \n \"Arrested! What for?\" she gasped. \n \n The man standing next to Keith interposed. \n \n \"For the murder of Jacob Lazarus,\" he said in a low voice. \n \n Eugénie closed her eyes with a sensation of horror, and caught hold of the wall for support. When she opened her eyes again, Keith and the detective had both vanished. \n \n \"Arrested for the murder of Lazarus!\" she muttered. \"My God! it can\u0027t be true!\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1861/53900.html","bookId":829,"book":{"id":829,"title":"Miss Mephistopheles","description":"简介： A wet Sunday--dreary, dismal, and infinitely sloppy.
