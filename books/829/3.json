{"id":11650,"no":3,"title":"CHAPTER III. PRINCE CARNIVAL.","content":"The \"Bon-Bon\" was the smallest, prettiest, and most luxurious theatre in Melbourne, and was exclusively devoted to farcical comedy, burlesque, and opera-bouffe, the latter class of entertainment being now the attraction. There was no pit, the circle and boxes being raised but little above the level of the stalls. The decorations were pink, white, and gold, the seats being covered with pale, rose-coloured plush, with curtains and hangings to match, while the electric lights, shining through pink globes, gave quite a warm glow to the theatre. The dome was decorated with allegorical figures representing Momus, the God of laughter, and Apollo, the God of music, while all round the walls were exquisitely-painted medallions of scenes from celebrated operas and burlesques. The proscenium was a broad frame of dullish gold, the curtain of roseate plush, and on either side of the stage were life-size statues of Offenbach and Planché in white marble. Altogether, a charming theatre, more like a cosy drawing-room than a place of public entertainment. \n \n At the entrance was a high flight of white marble stairs, leading to a wide corridor, the walls of which were hidden by enormous mirrors, and at intervals stood white marble statues of the Greek divinities, holding aloft electric lights. On the one side was the smoking-room,--a luxurious lounge,--and on the other a refreshment bar, all glass and glitter, which was crowded between the acts by the thirsty patrons of the play. \n \n Ezra and Keith arrived about nine o\u0027clock, just as the first act of \"Prince Carnival\" was over, and finding the salon tolerably full, Lazarus sat down near one of the small, marble-topped tables, and lighting his cigarette, proceeded to point out to Keith all the notabilities present. \n \n The first to whom he called Stewart\u0027s attention was a group of three. One, a tall, portly-looking man, with a red, clean-shaven face and black hair, was irreproachably attired in evening dress, and chatted to a fair-haired youth with a supercilious smile, and a short, bald-headed old gentleman. \n \n \"You see those three?\" said Ezra, indicating the group. \"The dark man of the ponderous Samuel Johnson type is Ted Mortimer, the lessee of the theatre; the idiot with the eyeglass is Lord Santon, who has come out from London to see us barbarians, and the apoplectic party with the bald head is no less a personage than Mr. Columbus Wilks, the great globe-trotter, who is going to write a book about Australia and New Zealand.\" \n \n \"That will take him some time,\" observed Keith, with a smile. \n \n \"Not at all,\" said Lazarus coolly. \"He will run through the whole of Australasia in a few weeks, be the guest of the governors of the different colonies, and then give his impressions of our government, politics, trade, amusements, and scenery in a series of brilliant articles, whose truth and accuracy will be quite in accordance with the time which he has taken to collect his materials.\" \n \n \"But he cannot judge of things so rapidly.\" \n \n \"Of course not; but he will view everything through the rose-coloured spectacles of champagne and adulation, so his book will depict our land as a kind of nineteenth-century Utopia.\" \n \n \"And Lord Santon?\" \n \n \"An hereditary legislator, who is being fêted for his title, and will go back to his ancestral halls with the firm conviction that we are a kind-hearted race of--savages.\" \n \n \"You are severe,\" said Keith, in an amused tone; \"you ought to give a lecture, entitled \u0027Men I have noticed;\u0027 it would certainly draw.\" \n \n \"Yes, all the women, not the men; they don\u0027t care for hearing remarks about themselves; but there is the bell for the rising of the curtain, so we had better go to our seats.\" \n \n They left the now empty salon, and went into the dress circle, which holds the same rank in the colonies as the stalls do in the London theatres. Though the house was crowded, they succeeded in getting excellent seats, being, in fact, those always reserved for the critics of The Penny Whistle. The orchestra played a lively waltz, to which the gods in the gallery kept time, and then the curtain drew up on a charming scene, representing a square in Rome. \n \n \"Prince Carnival\" was one of those frivolous French operas with a slightly naughty plot, witty dialogue, brilliant music, and plenty of opportunity for gay dresses and picturesque scenery. The principals and chorus consisted mostly of girls, with just a sprinkling of men, so that their deeper voices might balance the shrillness of those of the women. Of the plot, the least said the better, as it was merely a string of intrigues, connected by piquant couplets and sparkling choruses, with occasional ballets intervening. \n \n As far as Keith could gather, it had something to do with the adventures of the quack Cagliostra in Rome, who was the comic man of the play, and figured in various disguises, the most successful being that of a prominent politician. Cagliostra tries to gain the affections of a young girl beloved by a mountebank called Prince Carnival, who thwarts him all through the play. The second act was the carnival at Rome, and a crowd of masquers were singing a riotous chorus and pelting one another with flowers. Suddenly, during a lull in this fantastic medley, a high, clear voice was heard executing a brilliant shake, and immediately afterwards Caprice bounded gaily on to the stage, singing a melodious waltz song, to which the masquers moved in measured time. \n \n She was dressed in a harlequin costume, a mask on her face, a fool\u0027s baton in her hand, and innumerable silver bells hanging from her cap and dress, which jingled incessantly as she danced. But what attracted Keith\u0027s attention were the diamonds she wore--several stars and a necklace. She seemed one splendid blaze of jewels, and his eyes ached watching their flash and glitter during the rapid gyrations of her restless figure. \n \n \"Are those paste jewels?\" he asked Ezra, in a whisper. \n \n \"Paste!\" echoed that young man, with a soft, satirical laugh. \"Caprice wear paste jewels! Ask the men she\u0027s ruined where all their thousands went---where all their lands, horses, shares, salaries, disappeared to! Paste! Bah! my dear fellow, you don\u0027t know the number of ruined homes and broken hearts those diamonds represent.\" \n \n The act proceeded; the dialogue scintillating with wit, and the choruses becoming more riotous. Intrigue followed after intrigue, and situation after situation, in all of which Caprice was the central figure, until the climax was reached, in a wild bizarre chorus, in which she danced a vigorous cancan with Cagliostra, and finished by bounding on his shoulders to form the tableau as the curtain fell, amid the enthusiastic applause of the audience. \n \n Ezra and Stewart went out into the smoking-room to light their cigarettes, and heard on all sides eulogies of Caprice. \n \n \"She\u0027d make her fortune on the London stage,\" said Santon to Mortimer. \"Got such a lot of the devil in her--eh?--by Jove! Why the deuce don\u0027t she show in town?\" \n \n \"Aha!\" replied Mortimer shrewdly, \"I\u0027m not going to let her go if I can help it. Don\u0027t tempt away my only ewe lamb, when you\u0027ve got so many flocks of your own.\" \n \n \"She doesn\u0027t look much like a lamb,\" said Columbus Wilks dryly. \n \n \"Then she doesn\u0027t belie her looks,\" retorted Mortimer coolly. \"My dear sir, she\u0027s got the temper of a fiend, but she\u0027s such a favourite, that I put up with her tantrums for the sake of the cash.\" \n \n While this conversation was going on, Ezra and his friend were smoking quietly in a corner of the room chatting about the opera, when the Jew suddenly drew Keith\u0027s attention to a tall man talking to a friend in a confidential manner. He had a thin, sharp-looking face, keen blue eyes, and fair hair and beard. \n \n \"That gentleman,\" said Lazarus, \"could probably tell you something about those diamonds, he is an American called Hiram Jackson Fenton, manager of the \u0027Never-say-die Life Insurance Company.\u0027 Rumour--which is true in this case, contrary to its usual custom--says he is Caprice\u0027s latest fancy.\" \n \n \"He must have a lot of money to satisfy her whims,\" said Keith, looking at the American. \n \n \"Money!\" Ezra shrugged his shoulders. \"He hasn\u0027t much actual cash, for he lives far above his income. However, with a little judicious dabbling in the share market, and an occasional help from the children of Israel, he manages to get along all right. Our friend Caprice will ruin him shortly, and then he\u0027ll return to the Great Republic, I presume--good riddance of bad rubbish for Australia.\" \n \n \"And who is that colourless-looking little man who has just come up?\" \n \n \"He is rather washed out, isn\u0027t he?\" said Ezra critically. \"That is his assistant manager, Evan Malton. For some inexplicable reason they are inseparable.\" \n \n \"Oh, and is Mr. Malton also smitten with Caprice.\" \n \n \"Very badly--more shame to him, as he\u0027s only been married for twelve months--he neglects his young wife, and dances attendance at the heels of his divinity.\" \n \n \"Doesn\u0027t Hiram J--what\u0027s his name, object?\" \n \n \"Not at all. You see they\u0027re both mixed up in speculation, and work together for their mutual benefit. Malton is the Lazarus--I don\u0027t mean myself--who picks up the crumbs of love that fall from Mr. Dives Fenton\u0027s table.\" \n \n \"It can\u0027t last long,\" said Keith in disgust. \n \n \"It will last till Malton gets rid of Fenton, or Fenton gets the better of Malton--then there\u0027ll be a row, and the weakest will go to the wall. Tell me, whom do you think will win?\" \n \n \"I should say Fenton,\" replied Keith, glancing from the effeminate countenance of Malton to the shrewd, powerful face of the American. \n \n \"Exactly; he is, I fancy, the stronger villain of the two.\" \n \n \"Villain?\" \n \n \"Yes; I call any man a villain who neglects his wife for the sake of a light-o\u0027-love. As for Fenton, he is the most unscrupulous man I know.\" \n \n \"You seem to be pretty well acquainted with the scandal of Melbourne society,\" said Stewart as they went back to their seats. \n \n \"Of course, it is my duty; the press is ubiquitous. But tell me your opinion of Caprice?\" \n \n \"Judging by her acting to-night, she\u0027s a devil.\" \n \n \"Wait till the end of this act, and you\u0027ll swear she\u0027s an angel.\" \n \n \"Which will be correct?\" \n \n \"Both--she\u0027s a mixture!\" \n \n The curtain again drew up, amid the shuffling of the audience settling themselves in their places, and represented a fête in the gardens of Cagliostra\u0027s palace, brilliant with coloured lights and fantastically-dressed people. According to the story, Cagliostra has obtained possession of his prize, and woos her successfully, when Prince Carnival enters and sings a ballad, \"So Long Ago,\" in the hope of touching the heart of his false love. \n \n Caprice, dressed in a tight-fitting costume of silk and velvet, which showed off her beautiful figure to perfection, stood in the centre of the stage with a sad smile, and sang the waltz-refrain of the song with great feeling. \n \n \"For it was long ago, love, \n That time of joy and woe, love! \n Yet still that heart of thine \n Is mine, dear love, is mine!\" \n \n She gave to the jingling words a touch of pathos which was exquisitely beautiful. \n \n \"I believe she feels what she sings,\" whispered Keith. \n \n \"If you knew her story you would scarcely wonder at that,\" said Ezra bitterly. \n \n The song was redemanded, but Caprice refused to respond, and, the clamour still continuing, she shrugged her shoulders and walked coolly up the stage. \n \n \"She\u0027s in a temper to-night,\" said Mortimer to Santon. \"They can applaud till they\u0027re black in the face, but devil an answer they\u0027ll get from her, the jade! She isn\u0027t called Caprice for nothing.\" \n \n And so it happened, for the audience, finding she would not gratify them, subsided into a sulky silence, and Caprice went coolly on with the dialogue. Cagliostra, repentant, surrenders the girl to Prince Carnival, and the opera ended with a repetition of the galop chorus, wherein Keith saw the sad-eyed woman of a few moments before once more a mocking jibing fiend, dancing and singing with a reckless abandon that half-fascinated and half-disgusted him. \n \n \"What a contradiction,\" said Keith, as they left the theatre; \"one moment all tears, the next all laughter!\" \n \n \"With a spice of the devil in both,\" replied Ezra cynically. \"She is the Sphinx woman of Heine--her lips caress while her claws wound.\" \n \n They had a drink and a smoke together, after which they went round to the stage-door, as Ezra, in pursuance of improving Keith\u0027s fortunes, was anxious to introduce him to Caprice. Lazarus appeared to be well-known to the door-keeper, for, after a few words with him, they were admitted to the mysterious region behind the scenes. Caprice, wrapped up in a heavy fur cloak, was standing on the stage talking to Fenton. All around was comparatively quiet, as the scene-shifters having ended their duties for the night had left the theatre. Stewart could hardly believe that the little golden-haired woman he saw before him was the brilliant being of the previous hour, she looked so pale and weary. But soon another side of her versatile nature showed itself, for Fenton, saying something to displease her, she rebuked him sharply, and turned her back on the discomfited American. In doing so she caught sight of Lazarus, and ran quickly towards him with outstretched hand. \n \n \"My dear Mr. Lazarus,\" she said rapidly, \"I\u0027m so glad to see you! Meg told me all about her accident to-day, and how narrowly she escaped death. Good God, if I had lost her! But the gentleman who saved her--where is he?\" \n \n \"He is here,\" said Lazarus, indicating Keith, who stood blushing and confused before this divinity of the stage. \n \n In another moment, with a sudden impulse, she was by his side, holding his two hands in her own. \n \n \"You have done what I can never repay,\" she said rapidly, in a low voice. \"Saved my child\u0027s life, and you will not find me ungrateful. Words are idle, but if actions can prove gratitude, you may command me.\" \n \n \"I hope the young lady is all right,\" stammered Keith, as she dropped his hands. \n \n \"Oh, yes; rather shaken, but quite well,\" answered Caprice, in a relieved tone. \"Dear me, how careless I am; let me introduce you to these gentlemen--Mr. Fenton, Mr. Malton, and last, but not least, Mr. Mortimer.\" \n \n The three gentlemen bowed coldly, Fenton in particular, eyeing Keith in a supercilious manner, which made him blush with rage, as he thought it was owing to his shabby clothes. \n \n \"Is my carriage there?\" said Caprice, in reply to a speech of Malton\u0027s. \"Oh, then, I may as well go. Good-night, everybody. Mr. Stewart, will you give me your arm?\" and she walked off with the delighted Keith, leaving Fenton and Malton transfixed with rage, while Mortimer and Ezra looked on chuckling. \n \n Caprice talked brightly to her new friend till he placed her in her brougham, then suddenly became grave. \n \n \"Come down and have supper with me on Sunday fortnight,\" she said, leaning out of the window. \"Mr. Lazarus will be your guide. Good-bye at present,\" giving him her gloved hand. \"God bless you for saving my child.\" \n \n The carriage drove off, but not before Keith had seen that tears were falling down her face, whereat he marvelled at this strange nature, and stood looking after the carriage. \n \n \"She\u0027s not as bad as they say,\" he said aloud. \n \n Ezra, who was just behind him, laughed aloud. \n \n \"I knew you\u0027d say she was an angel.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1861/53882.html","bookId":829,"book":{"id":829,"title":"Miss Mephistopheles","description":"简介： A wet Sunday--dreary, dismal, and infinitely sloppy.
