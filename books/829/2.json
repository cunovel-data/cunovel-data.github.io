{"id":11649,"no":2,"title":"CHAPTER II. KEITH MEETS WITH AN ADVENTURE.","content":"After a storm comes a calm; so next morning the sun was shining brightly in the blue sky, and the earth had that clean, wholesome appearance always to be seen after heavy rains. The high wind had dried the streets, the drenched foliage of the trees in the Fitzroy Gardens looked fresh and green, and there was a slight chilliness in the atmosphere which was highly invigorating. Indeed, it was like a spring morning, mildly inspiriting; whilst all around there seemed to be a pleasant sense of new-born gladness quickening both animal and vegetable life. \n \n After breakfast, Ezra, who was going to the office of The Penny Whistle. the paper for which he worked, asked Keith to walk into town with him, and, as the young man had nothing particular to do, he gladly assented. They strolled slowly through the gardens, admiring the glistening green of the trees, the white statues sharply accentuated against their emerald back-ground, and the vivid dashes of bright colour given by the few flowers then in bloom. \n \n Stewart appeared to have quite recovered from his megrims of the previous night, and strolled gaily along, every now and then inhaling a long breath of the keen air. Ezra, who was watching him closely, saw from his actions his intense appreciation of his surroundings, and was satisfied that the young man possessed in a high degree that poetical instinct which has such an affinity with the joyousness or gloom of Nature. \n \n \"Ah! this is a morning when it is good to live,\" said Keith brightly. \"I always envied the satyrs and dryades of heathendom, with their intense animal enjoyment of Nature--not sensuality, but exuberant capability of enjoying a simple life.\" \n \n \"Like that with which Hawthorn endowed Donatallo?\" suggested Ezra. \n \n \"Poor Donatallo!\" said Stewart, with a sigh; \"he is a delightful illustration of the proverb, \u0027Where ignorance is bliss\u0027--he was happy till he loved--so was Undine till she obtained a soul.\" \n \n \"You seem to have read a great deal?\" observed Lazarus, looking at him. \n \n \"Oh, faith; my reading has been somewhat desultory,\" replied Stewart carelessly. \"All is fish that comes to my net, and the result is a queer jumble of information; but let us leave this pleasant gossiping, and come down to this matter-of-fact world. How do you think I can better my position?\" \n \n \"I hardly know as yet,\" replied the Jew, thoughtfully caressing his beard; \"but if you want immediate work, I can put you in the way of obtaining employment.\" \n \n \"Literary work?\" \n \n \"Unfortunately no--a clerkship in a--a--well, an office.\" \n \n \"Ugh! I hate the idea of being cribbed and confined in an office; it\u0027s such an artificial existence. However, beggars can\u0027t be choosers, so tell me all about it.\" \n \n \"My father wants a clerk,\" said Ezra deliberately, \"and if I recommended you I think you could get the position.\" \n \n \"Humph! And what is your father\u0027s occupation?\" \n \n \"Not a very aristocratic one,--a pawnbroker.\" \n \n Keith stopped short, and looked at his companion in surprise. \n \n \"I can\u0027t imagine you being the son of a pawnbroker,\" he said in a puzzled tone. \n \n \"Why not?\" asked Ezra serenely. \"I must be the son of some one.\" \n \n \"Yes; but a pawnbroker, it\u0027s so horribly un-poetical. Your father ought to have been a man of letters--of vague speculations and abstruse theories--a modern Rabbi Judah holding disputations about the Talmud.\" \n \n Lazarus shrugged his shoulders, and walked slowly onward, followed by his companion. \n \n \"My dear lad, the days of Maimonides are past, and we are essentially a money-making race. The curse which Jehovah pronounced on the Jews was the same as that of Midas--they turn everything they touch into gold.\" \n \n \"A pleasant enough punishment.\" \n \n \"Midas did not find it so; but to resume--my father, Jacob Lazarus, has his shop in Russell Street, so I will speak to him to-day, and if he is agreeable, I will take you with me to-morrow. I\u0027ve no doubt you\u0027ll get the billet, but the wages will be small.\" \n \n \"At all events, they will keep body and soul together till I find my El Dorado.\" \n \n \"You refer to literary fame, I suppose. How did you first take to writing?\" \n \n \"I think you asked me that question last night,\" said Keith, smiling, \"and I told you I couldn\u0027t explain. Like Pope, I lisped in numbers, and the numbers came. I\u0027ve no doubt they were sufficiently bad. I\u0027m sure I don\u0027t know why all authors begin with verse; perhaps it\u0027s because rhymes are so easy--fountain suggests mountain, and dove is invariably followed by love.\" \n \n \"Have you had any articles accepted since your arrival in Melbourne?\" \n \n \"One or two, but generally speaking, no one acknowledges that a possible Shakespeare or Dickens is embodied in me. I\u0027ve sent plays to managers, which have been declined on the plea that all plays come from London. I have seen editors, and have been told there was no room on the press--publishers have seen me, and pointed out that a colonial novel means ruination--encouraging for the future brainworkers of Australia, isn\u0027t it?\" \n \n \"We must all serve our apprenticeship,\" answered Lazarus quietly. \"The longest lane has a turning.\" \n \n \"No doubt; but my particular lane seems devilish long.\" \n \n Ezra laughed, and they walked down Collins Street, watching the crowd of people hurrying along to business, the cabs darting here and there, and the cable tramcars sliding smoothly along. Pausing a moment near the Scotch Church, they heard a street organ playing a bright melody. \n \n \"What tune is that?\" asked Keith, as they resumed their walk. \"Sounds awfully pretty.\" \n \n \"Song from \u0027Prince Carnival,\u0027\" replied Ezra, referring to an opera then running at the Bon-Bon Theatre. \"Caprice sings it.\" \n \n \"Oh, Caprice. I\u0027d like to see that opera,\" said Keith. \"You might take me to the theatre to-night to see it.\" \n \n \"Very well,\" assented Ezra. \"You will like Caprice--she is very charming.\" \n \n \"And if rumour speaks truly, very wicked.\" \n \n \"Added to which, she is the best-hearted woman in the world,\" finished the Jew dryly. \n \n \"What a contradiction,\" laughed Stewart. \n \n \"Women are always contradictory--\u0027tis a privilege of the sex.\" \n \n \"And one they take full advantage of.\" \n \n This airy badinage came to an end somewhat abruptly, for just as they arrived near the Victoria Coffee Palace, they were startled by the shriek of a woman. \n \n On the other side of the street a gaudily-dressed girl was crying and wringing her hands, while a child of about seven years of age was standing paralysed with fear directly in the way of a tram-car that came rushing down the incline. The two men stood horror-struck at what seemed to be the inevitable death of the child, for, though the driver put on the brakes, the speed was too great, and destruction appeared inevitable. Suddenly Keith seemed to recover the use of his limbs, and, with a sudden spring, bounded forward and tore the child off the fatal track, himself falling together with the child to the ground. He was not a moment too soon, for hardly had he fallen before the car at a slower speed rolled past, and ultimately came to a standstill at the foot of the incline. \n \n Stewart arose to his feet considerably shaken, his clothes torn and covered with mud, and a painful feeling in the arm, on which he had fallen. Ezra crossed over to him, and the rescued child was standing on the footpath in the grasp of the gaudily-dressed girl who spoke volubly, regardless of the crowd of people standing by. \n \n The conductor of the car came to inquire into the affair, and having found that no one was hurt, retired, and the tram was soon sliding down the street. The crowd dispersed gradually, until only the child, Ezra, Keith, and the shrill-voiced girl were left. \n \n \"Oh! gracious, good \u0027eavens!\" said this young lady, who appeared to be a nursemaid, and spoke rapidly, without any stops; \"to think as you should have bin nearly squashed by that ingine, and all comin\u0027 of runnin\u0027 out into the road, an\u0027 taking no notice of me as was postin\u0027 a letter in the pillar-box, not seeing anythin\u0027, thro\u0027 want of eyes at the back of me \u0027ead.\" \n \n The child, a quaint, thin-faced little girl, with dark eyes and glorious reddish-coloured hair, took no notice of this outburst, but pulled Keith\u0027s coat to attract his attention. \n \n \"Thank you, man,\" she said, in a thin, reedy voice; \"I will tell mumsey, and she will say nice things to you, and I will give you a kiss.\" \n \n Keith was touched in his soft heart by this na?ve appeal, and, bending down, kissed the pale little face presented to him, much to the alarm of the nursemaid, who lifted up her hands in horror. \n \n \"Oh! gracious, good \u0027eavens!\" she piped shrilly, \"as to what your mar will say, Miss Megs, I don\u0027t know, a-kissin\u0027 strange gents in the h\u0027open street; not but what he don\u0027t deserve it, a-dragin\u0027 you from under the ingine, as oughtn\u0027t to be let run to spile--\" \n \n \"Hold your tongue, Bliggings,\" said Ezra sharply; \"you ought to look more carefully after Meg, or she\u0027ll be killed some day.\" \n \n \"Oh! gracious and good \u0027eavens!\" cried Bliggings sniffing, \"if it ain\u0027t Mr. Lazarhouse; and, beggin\u0027 your pardon, sir, it ain\u0027t my fault, as is well known to you as children will \u0027ookit unbeknown\u0027t to the most wary.\" \n \n \"There, there,\" said Lazarus, bending down to kiss Meg; \"least said, soonest mended; thanks to my friend here, it\u0027s no worse.\" \n \n \"Which he ought to git a meddler,\" asserted Miss Bliggings, on whose feminine heart Keith\u0027s handsome face had made an impression. \"But, gracious and good \u0027eavens, they only gives \u0027em for drowndin\u0027, though I never lets Miss Megs go near water, ingines bein\u0027 unexpected in their actions, and not to be counted on in their movin\u0027s.\" \n \n \"Good-bye, Meg,\" said Lazarus, cutting short Bliggings in despair. \"Tell your mamma I\u0027ll call and see her about this.\" \n \n \"And bring the man,\" said Meg, glancing at Keith. \n \n \"Yes, and bring the man,\" repeated Ezra, upon which Meg, being satisfied, made a quaint-like curtsey to both men, and was going away, when she suddenly came back, and pulling Keith\u0027s coat till he bent down, put her arms round his neck and kissed him. \n \n \"Mumsey will be nice,\" she murmured, and then trotted quietly off with Bliggings, who kept expressing her opinion that, \"Oh! gracious, good \u0027eavens! she was red up to her eyes at such conduct,\" a somewhat unnecessary assertion, seeing her complexion was permanently the colour of beetroot. \n \n \"Come into Lane\u0027s Hotel and have a glass of brandy,\" said Ezra, when Meg and her attendant had disappeared; \"you need it after the shaking you have had.\" \n \n \"What is the child\u0027s name?\" asked Keith, as he went into the bar. \"You seem to know her.\" \n \n Ezra laughed softly, and ordered a glass of brandy for his friend. \n \n \"A curious way Fate has of working,\" he said, rather irrelevantly. \"She has played into your hands to-day, for that child is Kitty Marchurst\u0027s, better known as \u0027Caprice.\u0027\" \n \n \"I didn\u0027t know she had a child,\" said Keith. \"Who is the father? Is she married?\" \n \n \"No, she is not married. As to the father, it\u0027s a long story; I\u0027ll tell you all about it some day. Meanwhile, you have done her a service she will never forget.\" \n \n \"Much good it will be to me,\" said Keith disbelievingly \n \n \"You\u0027ve exactly hit it,\" replied Ezra composedly. \"She can do you a great deal of good, seeing that she is the reigning favourite of the stage at present. I will introduce you to her to-night, and then--\" \n \n \"Well?\" \n \n Ezra shrugged his shoulders, and replied slowly,-- \n \n \"The best friend an ambitious man can have is a clever woman; a wiser man than I made that remark.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1861/53881.html","bookId":829,"book":{"id":829,"title":"Miss Mephistopheles","description":"简介： A wet Sunday--dreary, dismal, and infinitely sloppy.
