He usually stopped in to see her on the way to his appointment or afterward. The progress he’d made in such a short time was truly impressive. “I was putting the finishing touches on the table,” Linnette said. “You want to help me?” “Linnette.” Her father’s voice betrayed some impatience. “Cal’s our guest. I don’t think it’s good form to ask him to set the table.” “Yes, Daddy,” she muttered, smiling at Cal. Cal grinned back and sat down on the sofa. Her father handed him a section of newspaper, which Cal accepted. Linnette returned to the kitchen. “The least Dad could do is talk to him,” she told her mother. Corrie shook her head. “You know your father.” “This is the man I’ll probably marry.” She truly hoped that was the case. Cal hadn’t brought up the subject of marriage yet, but as far as Linnette could tell, they were definitely headed in that direction. The doorbell rang again, and before anyone could answer, Mack walked into the house bearing a tall lily with three huge blooms. Her brother had trimmed his hair and actually looked decent. Well…halfway decent. This was an effort to appease their father, Linnette guessed. He wore jeans, sandals and a flowered shirt that made her shudder slightly. He needed a woman to help him dress better, but she wasn’t volunteering. Lucky followed him in and settled by the fireplace. “Happy Easter, everyone,” he said. “When’s the Easter egg hunt?” “You’re too old for chocolate bunnies,” Corrie laughed, coming out of the kitchen. She kissed her son on the cheek and made a fuss over the lily, then placed it in the center of the dining room table. Cal stood, and the two men shook hands. Linnette was immediately concerned. She hadn’t mentioned to her brother that Cal was working with a speech therapist and feared Mack might say something that would unintentionally embarrass him. “What’s for dinner?” Mack rubbed his palms together, as if he was ready to start eating that minute. “I’m starved.” “Good. We’ll begin as soon as Gloria gets here.” “You mean you didn’t make those little cheese rolls?” Mack asked, clearly disappointed. “Yeah,” Roy said, setting aside the newspaper. “What about a few appetizers to tide us over?” “They’re coming,” Corrie said. “Roy, could you see what everyone wants to drink?” “Mom bakes these little cheese-filled biscuits Mack loves,” Linnette explained for Cal’s sake. “You’ll want to taste them, but don’t overdo it or you’ll ruin your dinner.” “I won’t,” he promised. “No matter what holiday it is, Mack wants Mom to bake cheese biscuits. Easter, Thanksgiving. Christmas…” “Groundhog Day,” her brother added, as their father got to his feet to offer drinks. “They sound good,” Cal agreed. “I’ll have a beer, Dad.” “Me, too, Mr. McAfee,” Cal put in. Mack suddenly turned to him. “Hey, Cal—” Linnette kicked his ankle. “Ouch. What was that for?” Mack demanded. Linnette blushed. “Oh, sorry, did I kick you?” “Yes, and it hurt.” Her brother rubbed his ankle. “Come help me in the kitchen, would you?” she said pointedly and half dragged her brother out of the living room. As soon as they were out of earshot, she whispered fiercely, “Don’t embarrass Cal! He’s seeing a speech therapist about his stutter. Having everyone comment only calls attention to it.” “The only person embarrassing Cal,” her brother said in a whisper, “is you. Give the guy a break.” “What are you talking about?” “You’re suffocating him,” Mack insisted. “And if you keep doing that, you’re going to lose him.” Linnette started to tell her brother he was being ridiculous but then the doorbell rang a third time. Gloria had arrived. She still wore her police uniform. “I didn’t take time to change,” she said, “I hope that’s all right.” “Where’s Chad?” Linnette asked. She knew that Chad Timmons, the physician she worked with at the clinic, was interested in Gloria. “I didn’t ask him to join us,” Gloria said as she removed her jacket; Roy took it to hang in the hallway closet. Linnette was disappointed for Chad, who’d been hoping for an invitation. “Can we eat now?” Mack asked impatiently. “Did I hold up dinner?” Gloria wanted to know. “Not at all,” Corrie assured her. “I thought you wanted appetizers,” she reminded her son. “Oh, yeah.” “Well, they’re on the way.” They all sat in the living room, waiting for Corrie. Linnette was at Cal’s side and took his hand, entwining their fingers. Her mother had returned to the kitchen and now carried a plate of Mack’s favorite cheese biscuits, along with a veggie tray and dips. Roy passed out drinks—beers for all the men and glasses of white wine for the women. “You’ll love this dip Mom makes, too,” Linnette said, dipping a carrot stick in a rich creamy mixture and handing it to Cal. “I was in Cedar Cove earlier this week,” Mack said as he filled a small plate. The cheese biscuits were still hot, and he burned his finger. “Ouch, dammit.” “You didn’t come by,” Corrie murmured. “By the time I finished, all I wanted to do was get home and take a hot shower.” “Finished what?” Linnette asked her brother. Mack straightened and looked around the room. “I applied with the Cedar Cove fire department,” he announced. “What does the application process involve?” Gloria leaned forward, serving herself a small plate of appetizers. Mack took a gulp of beer. “I had to complete a physical test, and I’m not talking about some doc listening to my heart, either. This was running up flights of stairs and stuff like that.” “How’d you do?” their father asked. From the gleam in his eyes, Linnette knew her brother had passed. “All right, I guess. I’m taking the written exam next.” “I guess you like this sort of work, since you’re a volunteer firefighter,” Roy said. “At least you know exactly what you’re in for.” The two hadn’t always gotten along, but Linnette could see they were both making an effort. Roy didn’t add that he’d much prefer having his son a firefighter than working for the post office, although that wasn’t exactly a secret. “I do,” Mack responded. “I hope they hire me—and the truth is, I wouldn’t mind being closer to everyone on this side of the water. If I do get the job, it means I’ll be attending firefighting school for ten weeks. There’s one near North Bend.” “We’d love having you live closer,” Corrie told her son, her face glowing with happiness. “And ten weeks will pass quickly.” “I might be leaving for a while, too,” Cal said. “Leaving?” Linnette cried. Why hadn’t she heard of this before? That he’d chosen to bring it up at a family function distressed her. “Where are you going and why? You won’t be gone long, I hope.” “M-mustangs,” he said, faltering over a word for the first time that day. “What about mustangs?” she said, pressing him. When they were alone, she’d ask him more, but already she didn’t like the sound of this. “Wild mustangs—f-feral horses—are being rounded up by the Bureau of Land Management. Then they’re sold. Cliff and I—” “Cliff is sending you away? When?” Cal ignored her questions. “These wild horses, some of them, are being slaughtered. The BLM m-m-makes them available for adoption, and several rescue organizations—” “Cliff wants to add mustangs to his herd?” Linnette asked, too upset to allow Cal to finish. “He can send anyone. He doesn’t need to send you.” “Linnette,” Gloria said gently, “let Cal talk.” “I’m going to v-volunteer with the BLM and help round up mustangs and get them to the adoption centers.” He seemed to speak without stopping for breath. “I want to see that they’re p-protected. A lot of them are sold at auction and, like I said, some end up being slaughtered. I hope to work with one of the rescue groups to prevent that.” “How long will you be away?” she asked. Cal shrugged. “A month, maybe more.” “A month?” That was completely unreasonable. Wouldn’t this be a hardship for Cliff? Furthermore, it would be difficult on them as a couple. Surely a man didn’t walk away from a relationship this strong without discussing the prospect with the woman in his life. She didn’t understand why Cal hadn’t mentioned his interest in volunteering before now. Nor did she appreciate the fact that he’d revealed it in front of her family and not told her first. Perhaps Linnette was overreacting, but Cal was doing so well with his therapy and their relationship was everything to her. She couldn’t bear it if he left—even for a short time. “I think that’s a wonderful thing for you to do,” Corrie said. Thanks, Mom, Linnette thought irritably. “I do, too,” Mack concurred. “I’ve read about what’s happening to those wild horses and it’s a crying shame.” It was a crying shame, all right, Linnette mused. But the only one she felt sorry for was herself. She didn’t want Cal to leave Cedar Cove, but it almost seemed as if he couldn’t get away fast enough. Thirteen The Monday after Easter, Maryellen woke in good spirits—despite another night on the sofa. She missed sleeping with her husband, missed the intimacy they’d shared. Once this baby was born, she vowed she’d never sleep on a sofa again as long as she lived. Easter Sunday had been wonderful. When church services were over, Joseph and Ellen had taken Katie to a community Easter egg hunt. Katie had gleefully collected a basketful of colorful plastic eggs. She’d proudly showed her treasures to Maryellen and then later Jon. Her husband had conveniently disappeared when the Bowmans returned with Katie. Katie had needed a week or so to become accustomed to Jon’s parents, but by then her daughter realized she had these two people completely wrapped around her little finger. Joseph and Ellen lavished their granddaughter with attention and love. Katie was thriving, and Maryellen would be forever grateful for their presence. The Bowmans’ arrival had gone a long way toward bringing Maryellen peace during this complicated pregnancy. Her mother and Cliff helped as much as they could, and had decided to delay their wedding reception until after the baby’s birth. Grace visited at least three times a week and brought Maryellen library books to keep her entertained.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/6-rainier-drive-cedar-cove-6/page-16.html","bookId":1947,"book":{"id":1947,"title":"6 Rainier Drive (Cedar Cove #6)","description":"Storyline: 6 Rainier Drive (Cedar Cove #6) 6 RAINER DRIVE CEDAR COVE, WASHINGTON DEAR READER, As you may have heard, we\u0027ve recently had quite a shock.
