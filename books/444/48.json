{"id":21650,"no":48,"title":"CHAPTER XII.","content":"Miss Chubb could keep a secret. She was proud of being entrusted with one. She was much gratified when Rhoda Maxfield, on the Monday after Diamond\u0027s proposal, called at the maiden lady\u0027s modest lodgings, and confided to her the fact that Mr. Diamond had asked her to marry him, and that she had accepted him subject to her father\u0027s consent. It may seem strange that Rhoda should have chosen to make this confidence to Miss Chubb, rather than to Mrs. Errington, or to Minnie Bodkin, with both of whom she was more intimate. But she told Miss Chubb that she wanted her help. \"My help, my dear! I\u0027m sure I don\u0027t know how I can help you. But if I can I will. And I congratulate you sincerely. I\u0027ve seen how it would be all along. You know I told you that a certain gentleman was falling over head and ears in love, a long time ago. Didn\u0027t I, now?\" Rhoda acknowledged that it was so; and then she said she had come to ask a great favour. Would Miss Chubb mind saying a word or two on Mr. Diamond\u0027s behalf to her father? \"Father told me this morning, after breakfast, that he should make some inquiries about Mr. Diamond. I am quite sure that nothing will come out that is not honourable to him; I am not the least afraid of that. And I believe Dr. Bodkin will praise him very highly, but he will not perhaps say the sort of things that would please father most. He will tell him what a good scholar he is, and all that, but he will never think of making father understand that Mr. Diamond is looked upon as being as much a gentleman as he is himself. Gentlefolks like Dr. Bodkin take those things for granted. But father would like to be told them. He thinks so very much of my marrying—above my own class, for, of course, I have learnt enough to know that Mr. Diamond belongs to a different sort of people from mine.\" \"I understand, my dear,\" returned Miss Chubb, nodding her head shrewdly. \"And you may depend on my doing my best, if I have the chance. But I\u0027m afraid it is not likely that Mr. Maxfield will consult me on the subject.\" \"I told him to come to you. Father knows you are one of the few people with whom Mr. Diamond has associated in Whitford.\" \"Why don\u0027t you send him to Mrs. Errington? Oh, I forgot! Your father and she are two.\" Miss Chubb laughed to cover a little confusion on her own part, for she guessed that Rhoda might have other reasons for not asking Mrs. Errington\u0027s testimony in favour of her suitor. Then she added quickly, \"Or Minnie Bodkin, now! Minnie\u0027s word would go farther with your father than mine would. And Minnie and Mr. Diamond are such cronies. You had better send him to Minnie.\" \"No, thank you.\" \"But why not? Good gracious, she is the very person!\" \"No, I think not. We don\u0027t wish it known until father has given his decided consent. I have only told you in confidence, Miss Chubb.\" \"But—if the doctor knows it, Minnie must know it! And if I know it, why shouldn\u0027t she?\" \"No, thank you. I don\u0027t want to ask Miss Minnie about it.\" \"I wonder why that is, now!\" pondered Miss Chubb, when Rhoda was gone. And very probably Rhoda could not have told her why. Old Maxfield duly paid his visit to Miss Chubb. The good-natured little woman waited at home all day lest she should miss him. And about an hour after her early dinner Mr. Maxfield sent in his respects, and would be glad to have a word with her if she were at leisure. \"I hope you will overlook the intrusion, ma\u0027am,\" said Maxfield, standing up with his hat in his hand, just inside the door of the little sitting-room, where Miss Chubb asked him to walk in. \"No intrusion at all, Mr. Maxfield! I\u0027m very glad to see you. Please to sit down.\" He obeyed, and holding his thick stick upright before him, and his hat on his knees, he thus began: \"I\u0027m not a-going to waste your time and mine with vain and worldly discourse, ma\u0027am. I am a man as knows the value of time, thanks be! And I have a serious matter on my mind. You know my daughter Rhoda?\" \"I know Rhoda, and like her, and admire her very much.\" \"Yes; Rhoda is a girl such as you don\u0027t see many like her. There\u0027s a young man seeking her in marriage.\" \"I\u0027m not surprised at that!\" \"No; there has been several others too. But she gave \u0027em no encouragement; nor should I have been willing that she should. Some of them were persons in my own rank of life, and that would not do for Rhoda.\" \"I think you are quite right there, Mr. Maxfield. Rhoda is naturally very refined, and she has associated a good deal with persons of cultivated manners. I don\u0027t think Rhoda would be happy if she were obliged to give up certain little graces of life, which a great many excellent people can do without perfectly well.\" Maxfield nodded approvingly. \"You speak with a good deal of judgment, ma\u0027am,\" said he, with the air of a recognised authority on wisdom. \"But it isn\u0027t only that. Rhoda will have money—a great deal of money—more than some folks that holds their heads very high ever had or will have. Now it is but just and rightful that I should expect her husband to bring some advantages in return.\" \"Of course. And—ahem!—I\u0027m sure you are too sensible a man not to consider that the best thing a husband could bring in exchange would be an honest, loving heart, and a real esteem and respect for your daughter.\" Little Miss Chubb became quite fluttered after making this speech, and coloured as if she had been a girl of eighteen. \"Not at all,\" returned old Max decisively. \"The loving heart and the esteem and respect are due to my Rhoda if she hadn\u0027t a penny. In return for her fortin\u0027 I expect something over and above.\" \"Oh!\" exclaimed Miss Chubb, a good deal taken aback. \"Now I don\u0027t feel sure that the young man in question has that something over and above. It is Mr. Matthew Diamond, tutor at the Grammar School in this town.\" \"A most excellent young man! And, I\u0027m sure, most devotedly in love with Rhoda.\" \"But very poor, and not of much account in the world, as far as I can make out.\" \"Oh, don\u0027t say that, Mr. Maxfield! He is proud and shy, and has kept himself aloof from society because he chose to do so. But he would be a welcome guest anywhere in the town or county. Young Mr. Pawkins, of Pudcombe Hall, quite courts him; he is always asking him to go over there.\" Thus much and more Miss Chubb valiantly spoke on behalf of Matthew Diamond in his character of Rhoda\u0027s wooer. And then she expatiated on the excellent position he would hold as master of Dorrington School. It was such a \"select seminary;\" and so many of the first county people sent their boys there. \"Dear me,\" said Miss Chubb, \"it seems to me to be the very position for Rhoda! Not too far from Whitford, and yet not too near—of course she couldn\u0027t keep up all her old acquaintances here, could she?—and altogether so refined, and scholastic, and quiet! And really, Mr. Maxfield, see how everything turns out for the best. I thought at one time that young Errington was very much smitten with Rhoda; but, if she had taken him, you wouldn\u0027t have been so satisfied with her position in life now, would you? With all his talent and connection, see what a poor place he has of it. Mr. Diamond has done best, ten to one.\" This was a master-stroke, and made a great impression on old Max. Not that the latter even now was at all dazzled by the prospect of having the head-master of Dorrington School for his son-in-law. But Miss Chubb\u0027s allusion did suffice to show him that the world would consider Diamond to be a triumphantly successful man in comparison with Errington. \"Oh, him!\" said Maxfield in a tone of bitter contempt. \"No; such as him was not for Miss Maxfield. And I\u0027ll tell you, moreover, that I don\u0027t know but what she\u0027s throwing herself away more or less if she takes this other. She\u0027s a great catch for him; I know the world, and I know that she is a great catch. But I\u0027ve felt latterly one or two warnings that my end is near——\" \"Dear me, Mr. Maxfield! Don\u0027t say so! I\u0027m sure you look very hearty!\" exclaimed Miss Chubb, much startled by this cool announcement. \"That my end is near,\" repeated old Max doggedly, \"and I wish to set my house in order, and see my daughter provided for, before I go. And she seems to be contented with this young man. Rhoda ain\u0027t just easy to please. It might be a long time, if ever, before she found some one to suit her so well.\" Miss Chubb was a little shocked at this singularly prosaic and unemotional way of treating the subject of love and marriage, as to which she herself preserved the most romantic freshness of ideas. She would have liked the young couple to be like the lovers in a story-book, and the father to bestow his daughter and his blessing with tears of joy. However, she did her best to encourage Mr. Maxfield in giving his consent after his own fashion, and they parted on excellent terms with each other. \"That dry old chip, Jonathan Maxfield, has been to me to-day,\" said Dr. Bodkin after dinner to his wife and daughter. \"He came to ask me what prospect I thought Diamond had of getting the mastership of Dorrington, explaining to me that Diamond was a suitor for his daughter\u0027s hand. It took me quite by surprise. Had you any inkling of the matter, Minnie?\" \"Oh yes, papa.\" \"Dear me! Well, women see these things so quickly! H\u0027m! Well, Master Diamond has shown good taste, I must say. That little Rhoda is the prettiest girl I know. And such a sweet, soft, lovable creature! I think she\u0027s too good for him.\" \"It is a singular thing, but I have remarked very often that men in general are apt to think pretty girls too good for anybody but themselves!\" The doctor frowned, and then smiled. \"Have you so, Saucebox?\" he said. \"I don\u0027t know about her being too good for him,\" said Mrs. Bodkin, in her quick, low tones; \"but I suppose he knows very well what he is about. Old Maxfield has feathered his nest very considerably. It will be a very good match for a poor man like Matthew Diamond.\" Mrs. Bodkin had for some time past exhibited symptoms of dislike to Diamond. She never had a good word for him; she even was almost rancorous against him at times, although she seldom allowed the feeling to express itself in words before her daughter. Minnie understood it all very well. \"Poor mother!\" she thought to herself, \"she cannot forgive him. I wish I could persuade her that there is nothing to forgive. How could he help it if I was a fool?\" Yet the mother and daughter had never exchanged a word on the subject. And Minnie comforted herself with the conviction that her mother was the only person in the world who guessed her secret. \"Mamma has a sixth sense where I am concerned,\" said she to herself. \"I hope you said a good word for the lovers to Mr. Maxfield, papa,\" she said aloud, in a clear, cheerful voice. \"I had not much to say. I told him that I thought Diamond stood a good chance of getting Dorrington School.\" \"When will it be known positively, papa?\" \"About Dorrington? Oh, before Christmas. I should say by the end of the first week in December. Diamond will be a loss to me, but I shall be glad of his promotion. He\u0027s a gentleman, and a very good fellow, although his manner is a trifle self-opiniated. And,\" added the doctor, shaking his head and lowering his voice as one does who is forced to admit a painful truth, \"I am sorry to say that his views as to the use of the Digamma are by no means sound.\" \"Perhaps Rhoda won\u0027t find that a drawback to her happiness!\" said Minnie, laughing her sweet, musical laugh. \"Probably not, Puss!\" Then the Rev. Peter Warlock and Mr. Dockett dropped in. A whist-table was made up in the drawing-room. The doctor and Mr. Dockett won three rubbers out of four against Mrs. Bodkin and the curate. And the latter—being seated where he could command a full view of Minnie as she reclined near the fire with a book—made two revokes, and drew down upon himself a very severe homily and a practical lecture or short course on the science of whist, illustrated by all the errors he had made during the evening, from Dr. Bodkin. For the doctor, although he liked to win, cared not for inglorious victory, and was almost as indignant with his opponents as with his partner for any symptom of slovenly play. The Reverend Peter\u0027s brow grew serious, even to gloom, and it seemed to him as if the doctor\u0027s scolding were almost more than human patience could endure. \"I don\u0027t mind losing my sixpences,\" thought the curate, \"and I could make up my mind to sacrificing an hour or two over those accursed,\" (I\u0027m afraid he did mentally use that strong expression!) \"those thrice-accursed bits of pasteboard. But to be lectured and scolded at into the bargain——!\" He arose from the green table with an almost defiant sullenness. However, when the tray was brought in and the victimised gentleman had comforted his inner man with hot negus, and was at liberty to sip it in close proximity to Miss Bodkin\u0027s chair, and had received one or two kind looks from Miss Bodkin\u0027s eyes, and several kind words from Miss Bodkin\u0027s lips, his heart grew soft within him, and he began to think that even six, ten—a dozen rubbers of whist with the doctor would not be too high a price to pay for these privileges! Then they talked of Diamond\u0027s engagement to Rhoda—it had been spoken of all over Whitford hours ago!—and of his prospects. And Mr. Warlock was quite effusive in his rejoicings on both scores. He had been dimly jealous of Minnie\u0027s regard for Diamond, and was heartily glad of the prospect of getting rid of him. Mr. Dockett, too, seemed to think the match a desirable one. He pursed up his mouth and looked knowing as he dropped a mysterious hint as to the extent of Rhoda\u0027s dowry. \"I made old Max\u0027s will myself,\" said he; \"and without violating professional secrecy, I may confirm what I hear old Max bruits abroad at every opportunity—namely, that he is a warm man—a very warm man in—deed! But I\u0027m sure Mr. Diamond is a young man of sound principles, and will make the girl a good husband. And it is decided promotion for her too, you know. A grocer\u0027s daughter! Eh? I\u0027m sure I wish them well most sincerely.\" And shall we blame Mr. Dockett if, in his fatherly anxiety, he rejoiced at the removal of a dangerous rival to his little Ally, on whom young Pawkins had recently bestowed a good deal of attention whenever Rhoda Maxfield was out of his reach? \"I never knew such a popular engagement,\" said Dr. Bodkin, innocently. \"Everybody seems to approve! One might almost fear it could not be a case of true love, it runs so very smooth. There does not appear to be a single objection.\" \"Except the Digamma, papa!\" \"Except the Digamma,\" echoed the doctor merrily. And when he was alone with his wife that night, he remarked to her that he was immensely thankful to see the great improvement in their beloved child this winter. \"Minnie is certainly stronger,\" said the mother. \"And in such excellent spirits!\" said the father.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2168/61309.html","bookId":444,"book":{"id":444,"title":"A Charming Fellow","description":"简介： The room was very quiet.
