{"id":21645,"no":43,"title":"CHAPTER VII.","content":"\"So you had that fine gentleman, Mr. Algernon—What-d\u0027ye-call-it—Errington, here last evening?\" said Jonathan Maxfield to his daughter, on his return from Duckwell. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, father; he had been before in the afternoon. He was very anxious to see you; but Aunt Betty told him you wouldn\u0027t be back until to-day.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Very anxious to see me, was he? I have my own opinion about that. But, no doubt, he wants me to believe that he\u0027s anxious.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He seems in a good deal of distress of mind, father.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I daresay. And what about the minds of the folks as hold his promises to pay? Just so much waste paper, those are, I take it; I\u0027d as lief have his word of honour myself. And most people in Whitford know what that\u0027s worth.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I think he has been very unfortunate, father.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"H\u0027m! What worldly folks calls misfortin\u0027 is generally the Lord\u0027s dealing according to deserts. It\u0027s set forth in Scripture that the righteous man shall prosper, and the unrighteous be brought to naught.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But—father, even good people are sometimes chastened by afflictions,\" said Rhoda timidly. \\n\\n \\n\\n Old Max knitted his brows. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There\u0027s nothing,\" said he, \"more dangerous than for the young and inexperienced to wrest texts; it leads \u0027em far astray. When that kind o\u0027 chastening is spoken of, it don\u0027t mean the sort of trouble as has fallen on young Errington. The Almighty has given every man reason enough to understand that, if he spends thirteenpence out of every shilling, he\u0027ll be beggared before the year\u0027s end. I don\u0027t believe in men being ruined without fault or foolishness of their own.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He asked me if I—if you—if I thought——he asked me to ask you to have a little patience with him about some bills. I didn\u0027t know that he had any bill here; but he said you would understand.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Aye, aye! I understand. It isn\u0027t bills for tea, and flour, and bacon, and such like. It\u0027s a different kind o\u0027 bills the young gentleman\u0027s been meddling with; and a fine hand he\u0027s made of it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Couldn\u0027t you help him, father?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Rhoda spoke pleadingly, but with the timidity which always attended her requests to her father, whose recent indulgence had never reached a point of weakness, and who clearly showed, in all his dealings with his daughter, that he was not carried away by his affection for her, but acted with the consciousness of a will unfettered by precedents, and perfectly able to choose its course without regard to what other people might expect of him. \\n\\n \\n\\n For herself, in pleading for Algernon, she was not moved by self-conscious sentimentality, neither did she suppose herself to be doing anything heroic. The peculiar tenderness she still felt for him was made up of pity and memory. The Algy she had loved was gone—had melted into thin air, like a dream under the morning sunlight. Mr. Errington, the postmaster of Whitford, and the husband of the Honourable Castalia Kilfinane, was a very different personage. Still he was inextricably connected in her mind with that bright idol of her childhood and her youth. His marriage had put all possibility of love-making between him and herself as much out of the question, to her mind, as if he had been proved to be her brother. Rhoda had read no romances, and she was neither of an innovating spirit nor a passionate temperament, and it is surprising what power a sincere conviction of the irrevocable and inevitable has to control the \"natural feelings\" we hear so much of! But she clung tenaciously to a better opinion of Algernon than his actions warranted—as has been the case with many another woman—chiefly to justify herself for ever having loved him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Couldn\u0027t you help him, father?\" she repeated, seeing that her father did not at once reply, but was sitting meditating, with a not altogether ill-pleased expression of face. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Help him!\" cried old Max. \"Why should I help him? A reprobate, unregenerate, vain, ungrateful worldling! I did help him once, and earned much gratitude for my pains. And what a sneaking, poor, mean, pitiful fellow he must be to come here and whine to you! A poor, pitiful fellow! Talk of a gentleman! Yah!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Old Max derived so much grim satisfaction from the contemplation of Algernon\u0027s pitiful behaviour that it seemed almost to soften him towards the culprit, in whom any glimpse of nobility would not have been very welcome to his enemy. When you hate a man on excellent private grounds, it is certainly unpleasant to see him displaying qualities in public which win a fallacious admiration. And this aggravation was one which old Max had been suffering for some time at the hands of the popular Algernon. His present money difficulties, combined with his unworthy methods of meeting them, at once gratified and justified Jonathan Maxfield\u0027s vindictiveness. \\n\\n \\n\\n He gave forth the queer grunting noise that served him for a laugh, as he said, \"And a lot o\u0027 good his fine marriage has done him! And his grand relations! I told him long ago that if he wanted help from such as them, he must ask it with a pocket full of money. Then he might ha\u0027 been uplifted into high places. And it wasn\u0027t only my own wisdom neither, though that might ha\u0027 been enough for such a half-fledged young cockerel as he was in them days, seeing it has been enough for his betters before now. I had the warrant of Scripture; for what says Solomon? \u0027Wealth maketh many friends; but the poor is separated from his neighbour.\u0027\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Still Rhoda did not altogether despair of inducing her father to do something for Algernon. What that something might be, or how far it was possible for her father to assist young Errington, except by simply giving or lending him money, Rhoda was ignorant. Algernon in talking to her had spoken very glibly, but, to her, very unintelligibly, of bills which were in her father\u0027s hands; and had pointed out, with an air of candour and conviction, that it would be imprudent on Mr. Maxfield\u0027s part to drive matters to extremity. It had all sounded very convincing, simply from the tone in which it was said. Many of us are astonishingly uncritical as to the coherence and cogency of words if they be but set to a good tune. \\n\\n \\n\\n Algernon himself was rather hopeful since that interview with Rhoda. It could not be, after all, that Jonathan Maxfield would actually cause him, Algernon Errington, any personal inconvenience for the sake of a sum which was really a mere trifle to Maxfield, and which appeared very trifling to Algernon under every aspect except that of being called upon to pay it. \\n\\n \\n\\n He had learned not long previously that certain bills he had given, backed by the name of that solid capitalist, the Honourable Jack Price, had found their way into old Max\u0027s hands. This startled him considerably, for he had no reason to count on the old man\u0027s forbearance. The time was drawing nigh when the bills would become due. \\n\\n \\n\\n About a month ago some other bills had fallen due, and had been duly honoured. They had been given to a London wine merchant, who would certainly not have scrupled to take any strong measure for getting his money. And even the name of Jack Price was no talisman to charm away this grasping tradesman\u0027s determination to be paid for goods delivered; the wine merchant in question doing a large City business, and feeling no anxiety as to the opinion entertained by the Honourable Mr. Price\u0027s fashionable connection about himself or his wares. Under the pressure of this disagreeable conviction, the money had been found to honour the bills held by the wine merchant. \\n\\n \\n\\n For the discharge of the liabilities represented by the bills now in Maxfield\u0027s hands, Algernon had reckoned on Castalia\u0027s extracting some money from her uncle. Algernon did not abandon the hope that she might yet succeed in doing so. Castalia must be urged to make new and stronger representations of their necessities to Lord Seely. But it could not be denied that my lord\u0027s last letter had been a very heavy blow; and that, moreover, a number of slight embarrassments, which Algernon had hitherto looked on as mere gossamer threads, to be broken when he pleased, had recently exhibited a disconcerting toughness and power of constraining his actions and destroying his comfort. \\n\\n \\n\\n The thought not infrequently occurred to him that, if he were alone in the world, unhampered by a wife who had no flexibility of character, and who had recently displayed a stubborn kind of obtuseness, showing itself in such remarks as that if they had not money to pay for luxuries, they must do without luxuries, and that if they were poor, it would be better to seem poor, and the like dull commonplaces, which were peculiarly distasteful to Algernon\u0027s vivacious intelligence—if, he thought, he had no wife, or a different wife, things would undoubtedly go better with him. He was too quick not to perceive that his marriage, far from improving his social position, had been eminently unpopular amongst his friends and acquaintances. To be sure he had never intended to return to Whitford after allying himself with the family of Lord Seely. He had meant to shake the dust of the sleepy little town from his feet for ever. He reckoned up the advantages he had expected to gain by marrying Castalia, and set the real result against each one in his mind. \\n\\n \\n\\n He had expected to get into the diplomatic service. He was a provincial postmaster! \\n\\n \\n\\n He had expected to live in some splendid metropolis. He found himself in the obscure town which, of all others, he wished to avoid! \\n\\n \\n\\n He had expected to be courted and caressed by wealthy, noble, and distinguished persons. He was looked coldly or shyly upon by even the insignificant middle-class society of a county town! \\n\\n \\n\\n All this seemed peculiarly hard and unjust, because Algernon had always intended to bear his honours gracefully, without stiffness or arrogance. He would cut nobody; he would turn the cold shoulder to nobody. He had pictured himself sometimes making a meteoric reappearance in Whitford some day; flashing with brief brilliancy across the horizon of that remote neighbourhood, affably shaking hands with old acquaintance, occupying the best rooms in the \"Blue Bell,\" and scattering largesse among the servants, rattling through the streets side by side with some county magnate, whose companionship should by no means chill his recognition of such local stars of the second or third magnitude as the Pawkinses of Pudcombe Hall. He was inclined by taste and temperament to be thoroughly \"bon prince.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Such fancies may seem childish, but it was a fact that Algernon had indulged in them. With all his tact, he had a considerable strain of his mother\u0027s Ancramism in his blood. And the contrast between those former day-dreams and the present reality was so terrible, so mortifying, so ridiculous (direst and most soul-chilling word of all to Algernon!) that he was unable to face it. Some way out must be found. It was impossible, on any tenable theory of society, that he should be permanently consigned to oblivion and the daily round of inglorious duties. \\n\\n \\n\\n As to what Lord Seely said about meriting advancement by diligence, and working for ten or fifteen years, it seemed to Algernon pretty much like exhorting a convict to step his daily round of treadmill in so painstaking a manner as to win the approbation of the gaol authorities. What would he care for their approbation? It was impossible to take either pride or pleasure in working out one\u0027s penal sentence. \\n\\n \\n\\n Algernon felt very bitter against Lord Seely as he pondered these things, and not a little bitter against Castalia, who had, as it were, bound him to this wheel, and had latterly added the sting of her intolerable temper to his other vexations. Fate had used him despitefully. He seemed to consider that some gratitude was due to him on the part of the supernal powers for his excellent intentions—he would have borne prosperity so well! A feeling grew upon him, which would have been desperation but for his ever-present, instinctive efforts not to hurt himself. \\n\\n \\n\\n On the morning after the visit to Maxfield\u0027s house—of which Castalia had been an unseen witness—Algernon went to the post-office somewhat earlier than usual. As he reached it a man was coming out, who scowled upon him with so sullen and hostile a countenance, that it affected him like a blow. \\n\\n \\n\\n He was, on the whole, in better spirits on this special morning than he had been for some time past. Not that he was habitually depressed by his troubles, but there was a certain apprehension and anxiety in his daily life which flavoured it all unpleasantly. But on this morning he was, for various reasons, feeling hopeful of at least a reprieve from care, and the man\u0027s angry frown not only hurt but startled him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Who is that fellow who has just gone out?\" he asked of Gibbs, entering the office by the public door instead of his own private one, in order to put the question. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That is Roger Heath, the man who has lost his money-letter.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"An uncommonly ill-looking rascal, I take leave to think.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ahem! He is a decent, God-fearing man, sir, I believe; but at present he is wrath, and not without some excuse, either. He tells me he has written to the head office——\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And what then?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And has been told that due inquiries will be made, of course.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And what then?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why then—I suppose that\u0027s the last he\u0027ll hear of it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Algernon lightly flicked a white handkerchief over his face and bright curling hair, filling the close little office with a delicate perfume as he said, \"So there\u0027s an end of that!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"An end of it, I suppose, so far as Heath is concerned. But I doubt we shall hear more of the matter in the office.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Algernon paused with his hand on the lock of the door leading to his private room. He kept his hand there, and scarcely turned his head as he asked, \"How so?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Gibbs shook his head, and began to expatiate on the singular misfortunes which had been accumulated on the Whitford Post-office, and to hint that when two or three suspicious cases had followed each other in that way, an office was marked by the superior authorities, and means were taken to discover the culprit. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Means! What means?\" said Algernon, carelessly. \"You said yourself that it was next to impossible to trace a stolen letter. And, really, if people will be such idiots as to send money by post without precaution, in spite of all the warnings that are given to them, they deserve to lose it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That may be, sir. Still, of course, it is no light matter to steal a letter. And as to the means of tracing it, why I have heard of trap-letters being sent, containing marked money.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The handle clicked, the door was opened and sharply shut again, and the Whitford postmaster disappeared into his private room. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was more than an hour before Algernon reappeared in the outer office. He advanced towards Gibbs, and leaning on his shoulder with great affability, said to him in a low voice, \"You\u0027ve no suspicion of any one about this place, eh? The old woman that cleans the office, that boy Jem, no suspicion of anybody, eh? Oh! well I\u0027m excessively glad of that! One hates to be distrustful of the people about one.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Gibbs shook his head emphatically and decisively. \"No one has access to the office unless in my presence, sir; not a creature.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The fact is,\" said Algernon, slowly, \"that I have missed one or two papers of my own lately; matters of no consequence. God knows why anyone should have thought it worth while to take them! But they\u0027re gone.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Gibbs looked up with serious alarm in his face. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Dear me, sir!\" he exclaimed; \"dear me, Mr. Errington! I wish you had mentioned this before.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh well, you know, I thought I might be mistaken. I hate being on the watch about trifles. But latterly I am quite sure that papers have disappeared from my secretaire.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"From that little cabinet with drawers in it, that stands in your room?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Exactly.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But—I was under the impression that you kept that carefully locked!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Algernon laughed outright. \"What a fellow you are, Gibbs! Fancy my keeping anything carefully locked! The fact is, it is as often open as shut. Only a few days ago, for instance, Mrs. Errington mentioned to me that she found it unlocked when she was here——\" He stopped as if struck by a sudden thought, and turned his eyes away from Gibbs, who was looking up at him with the same uneasy expression on his face. \"By-the-way, Mrs. Errington did not stay very long here, did she?\" asked Algernon, with a degree of marked embarrassment very unusual in him. It was an embarrassment so ingeniously displayed that one might almost have suspected he wished it to be observed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"When do you mean, sir? Mrs. Errington comes very often; very often indeed.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Does she?—I mean—I mean the last time she was here. Did she stay long then?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"N—no,\" answered Gibbs, removing his eyes from Algernon\u0027s face, and biting the feather of his pen thoughtfully. \"At least, I think not, sir. I cannot be sure. She very often does not pass out through my office, but goes away by the private door in the passage.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n There was a pause. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I really am very glad that you don\u0027t suspect any of the people about the place, Gibbs,\" said Algernon at length, rousing himself with some apparent effort from a reverie. \"As long as I have any authority here, no innocent person shall be made unhappy for one moment by watchfulness and suspicion.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s a very kind feeling, Mr. Errington. But I shouldn\u0027t think an innocent person would mind being watched in such a case. For my own part, I hope we shall trace the matter out. It shan\u0027t be my fault if we don\u0027t.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You are wonderfully energetic, Gibbs. An invaluable public servant. But, Gibbs, it will not, I think, be any part of your duty to mention to any one at present the losses I have spoken of from my secretaire. There is no reason, as yet, to connect them with the missing letters. I did not duly consider what I was saying. The papers, after all, were only private letters of my own, Gibbs. They concern no one but myself. One was a mere note—an invitation from a lady. They could have had no value for a thief, you know. I—I daresay I mislaid it, and never put it into the secretaire at all.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Algernon went away with downcast eyes and hurried step, and Mr. Gibbs stared after him with a bewildered gaze. Then slowly the expression of his face changed to one of consternation and pity. \"Poor young man!\" he exclaimed, half aloud. \"That woman has been making free with his papers beyond a doubt. And he does his best to shield her. A worldly-minded, vain woman she is, that looks at us as if we were made of a different kind of clay from her. And they say she is furiously jealous of her husband. But this—this is serious! This is very serious, indeed. I am sorry for the young man with all my heart!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2168/61304.html","bookId":444,"book":{"id":444,"title":"A Charming Fellow","description":"简介： The room was very quiet.
