{"id":21638,"no":36,"title":"CHAPTER XVII.","content":"Minnie Bodkin had not dismissed from her mind the rumours about Algernon Errington, which she had heard from the widow Thimbleby. After some consideration she resolved to speak to him directly on the subject, and decided on the manner of doing so. \"I will not try to speak to him in the presence of other people,\" she thought. \"He would wriggle off and slip through my fingers if he found the conversation had any tendency to become disagreeable. And then, too, it might be difficult to speak to him without interruption.\" This latter consideration had reference to Minnie\u0027s observation of Mrs. Algernon, who never saw her husband engaged in conversation with Miss Bodkin without unceremoniously thrusting herself between them. The result of Minnie\u0027s deliberations was the sending of the following note to the Whitford Post-office:— \"My dear Algernon,—I want to say a word to you quietly. Can you come to me on your way home this afternoon? I will be ready to receive you at any hour between four and six. Don\u0027t disappoint your old friend, \"M. B.\" At a few minutes before five that evening Mr. Ancram Errington presented himself at Dr. Bodkin\u0027s house, and was shown up to Minnie\u0027s room. It was one of Minnie\u0027s good days. She was seated in her lounging-chair by the fire, but she was not altogether reclining in it—merely leaning a little back against the cushions. A small writing-table stood in front of her. It was covered with papers—amongst them a copy of the local newspaper—and she had evidently been busily occupied. When Algernon entered she held out her hand with a smile of welcome. \"This is very good!\" she exclaimed. \"I was not sure that I should succeed in tearing your postmastership away from the multifarious duties——\" Algernon winced, and held up his hand. \"Don\u0027t, Minnie!\" he cried. \"For mercy\u0027s sake, let me forget all that for half an hour!\" \"Oh, reassure yourself, most overworked of public servants! It is not about the conveyance of his Majesty\u0027s mails that I am going to talk to you.\" \"Upon my word, I am infinitely relieved to hear it.\" And, indeed, his countenance brightened at once, and he took a chair opposite to Minnie with all his old nonchalant gaiety. \"How you hate your office!\" said Minnie, looking at him curiously. \"More, even, than your native laziness—which I know to be considerable—would seem to account for.\" \"Not at all! There is no difficulty in accounting for my distaste for the whole business. There can be no difficulty. It is the simplest, most obvious thing in the world!\" \"Don\u0027t things go smoothly? Have you any special troubles or difficulties in the office, Algernon?\" \"Special troubles! My dear Minnie, what on earth are you driving at?\" \"I am \u0027driving\u0027 at nothing more than the simple sense of my words implies,\" she answered, with a marked shade of surprise in her countenance. \"I mean just what I say. Is your work going pretty smoothly? Have you any complaints? Does your clerk do well?\" \"Oh, Gibbs? Capitally, capitally! Old Obadiah is a first-rate fellow. Did you know his name was Obadiah? Absurd name, isn\u0027t it? Oh yes; he\u0027s all right. I trust him entirely—blindly. He has the whole thing in his hands. He might do anything he liked in the office. I have every confidence in Gibbs. But now, Minnie, let us have done with the subject. If you had as much of it as I have you would understand——Come, dismiss the bugaboo, or I shall think you have entrapped me here to talk to me about the post-office. And I warn you I don\u0027t think I should be able to stand that, even from you!\" \"How absurdly you are exaggerating, Algy,\" said Minnie, shaking her head at him, and yet smiling a little at the same time. \"But be at peace. I have nothing to say on the subject of the Whitford post-office. My discourse will chiefly concern the Whitford postmaster, and——No! Don\u0027t be so ridiculous! not in his official capacity, either!\" \"Oh! Well, in his private character, I should think it impossible to find a more delightful topic of conversation than that interesting and accomplished individual,\" returned Errington, laughing and settling himself comfortably in his chair. \"I hope it may prove so. Tell me, first, how is Mrs. Algernon Ancram Errington?\" \"Why, Castalia is not very well, I think, although I don\u0027t know what is the matter. She grows thinner and thinner, and sallower and sallower. Entre nous, Minnie, she frets and chafes against our life here. She has not the gift of looking on the bright side of things. She is rather peevish by nature. It\u0027s a little trying sometimes, coming on the back of all the other botherations. Ha! There!\" (passing his hand quickly across his forehead) \"let us say no more on that subject either. And now to return to the interesting topic—the delightful and accomplished—eh? What have you to say to me?\" Minnie seized on the opportunity, which chance had afforded her, to introduce the matter she wished to speak about. \"Do you think your wife is annoyed by the importunities of tradespeople, Algy? That would be enough to fret her and sour her temper.\" \"Importunities of tradespeople? Good gracious, no! And, besides, I don\u0027t think Castalia would allow the importunities of tradespeople to disturb her much. I should fancy that a Bourbon princess could scarcely look on such folks from a more magnificent elevation than poor Castalia does. But, Que voulez-vous? She was brought up in that sort of hauteur.\" \"I quite believe in your wife\u0027s disregard for the feelings of the tradespeople,\" answered Minnie drily. \"But this is a question of her own feelings, you see. Come, Algernon, may I take the privilege of our old friendship, and speak to you quite frankly?\" \"Pray do, my dear Minnie. You know I always loved frankness.\" He looked the picture of candour as he turned his bright blue eyes on his friend. \"Well, then, to begin with a question. Do you not owe money to several persons in Whitford?\" \"My dear Minnie, don\u0027t look so solemn, for mercy\u0027s sake! \u0027Owe money!\u0027 Why I suppose everybody owes money. A few pounds would cover all my debts. I assure you I am never troubled on the subject.\" \"I am glad to hear it. But—will you forgive the liberty I am taking for the sake of my motive, and give me carte blanche to be as impertinent as I please.\" \"With all my heart!\" he answered unhesitatingly. \"Thanks, Algy. Then, to proceed without circumlocution: I am afraid that, since neither you nor your wife are accustomed to domestic economy, you may possibly be spending more money than is quite prudent, without being aware of it. You say you are not disturbed by your debts; but, Algy, I hear things on this subject which are never likely to reach your ears; or not until it is too late for the knowledge of them to serve you. And I have reason to think that there is a good deal of unpleasant feeling among the Whitford tradespeople about you and yours.\" \"You will excuse me for observing that the Whitford tradespeople always have been, within my recollection, a set of pig-headed, prejudicial ignoramuses, and that I see no reason to apprehend any speedy improvement in the intelligence of that highly respectable body.\" \"Don\u0027t laugh, Algernon. The matter is serious. You have not been troubled yet, you say. But the trouble may begin at any moment, and I should wish you to be prepared to meet it. You may have bills sent in which——\" \"Bills? Oh, as to that, there\u0027s no lack of them already! I must acknowledge the great alacrity and punctuality with which the mercantile classes of this town send in their weekly accounts. Oh dear yes, I have a considerable collection of those interesting documents; so many, in fact, that the other day, when Castalia was complaining of the shabbiness of the paperhangings in our dining-room, I proposed to her to cover the walls with the tradesmen\u0027s bills. It would be novel, economical, and moral; a kind of memento mori—a death\u0027s head at the feast! Fancy seeing your butcher\u0027s bill glaring down above the roast mutton every day, and the greengrocer\u0027s \u0027To account delivered,\u0027 restraining the spoon that might otherwise too lavishly dispense the contents of the vegetable dishes!\" \"Algy, Algy!\" \"Upon my honour, Minnie, I made the suggestion. But Castalia looked as grave as a judge. She didn\u0027t see it at all. The fact is, poor Cassy\u0027s sense of humour is merely rudimentary.\" Minnie joined her hands together on the table, and thus supported, she leant a little forward, and looked searchingly at the young man. \"Algernon,\" she said with slow deliberation, \"I begin to be afraid that the case is worse than I thought.\" \"What do you mean?\" he asked, almost roughly, and with a sudden change of colour. \"I mean that you really are in difficult waters. How has it come to pass that the weekly accounts have accumulated in this way?\" He laughed a little forced laugh, but he looked relieved, too. \"The process is simple. They keep sending \u0027em in!\" \"And then it is said—forgive me if I appear intrusive—that you gave orders for wine and such things out of Whitford. And that does not incline the people of the place to be patient.\" \"Well, by Jove!\" exclaimed Algernon, throwing himself back in his chair and thrusting his hands into his pockets, \"that is the most absurd—the most irrational—the most preposterous reason for being angry with me! They grumble when I run up a bill with them, and they are affronted when I don\u0027t!\" \"Does your wife understand—or—or control the household expenditure?\" \"Bless you, no! She has not the very vaguest ideas of anything of the kind. When she had an allowance from her uncle for her dress, my lord used to have to come down every now and then with a supplementary sum of money to get her out of debt.\" He spoke with an air of perfectly easy amusement, and without a trace of anxiety; unless, perhaps, an accustomed ear might have detected some constraint in his voice. \"But could she not be made to understand? Why not give her some hints on domestic economy? It should be done kindly, of course. And surely her own good sense——\" Algernon pursed up his mouth and raised his eyebrows. \"She considers herself an unexampled victim as it is. I think \u0027lessons on domestic economy\u0027 would about put the finishing stroke to the internal felicity of Ivy Lodge!\" Minnie looked pained. They were trenching here on ground on which she had no intention of venturing farther. It formed no part of her plan to be drawn into a discussion respecting the defects and shortcomings of Algernon\u0027s wife. She was silent. Algernon got up from his chair, and came and stood before Minnie, taking both her hands in his. \"My dear girl,\" he said, \"I cannot tell you how much I feel your kindness and friendship. But, now, pray don\u0027t look so terribly like the tragic muse! I assure you there is no need, as far as we are concerned. Castalia is perhaps a little extravagant; but, after all, what does it amount to? A few pounds would cover all I owe. The whole of our budget is a mere bagatelle. The fact is, you have attached too much importance to the chatter of these thick-headed boobies. They hate us, I suppose, because Castalia\u0027s uncle is a peer of the realm, and because we dine late, and because we prefer claret to Double X—or for some equally excellent and conclusive reasons.\" \"I don\u0027t know that they hate you, Algy,\" returned Minnie, but not with an air of very perfect conviction. \"And, after all, it is scarcely a proof of personal malignity to wish to be paid one\u0027s bill!\" Algernon laughed quite genuinely. \"Oh yes it is!\" he cried. \"A proof of the direst malignity. What worse can they do?\" \"Well, Algernon, I cannot presume to push my sermonisings on you any farther. You will give me credit at least for having ventured to make them from a single-minded wish to be of some service to you.\" \"My dear Minnie! you are the \u0027best fellow\u0027 in the world! (You remember I used to call you so in my saucy, school-boy days, and when your majesty condescended to permit my impertinences?) And to show you how thoroughly I appreciate your friendship, I don\u0027t mind telling you that when I am removed from this d—— delightful berth that I now occupy, I shall have to get Uncle Seely to help us out a little. But I feel no scruple about that. Something is due to me. I ought never to have been placed here at all. Well, no matter! It was a mistake. My lord sees it now, and he is setting to work in earnest for me in other quarters. I have every reason to believe that I shall get very pretty promotion before long. It isn\u0027t my business to go about proclaiming this to the butchers and bakers, is it? And between you and me, Miss Bodkin, your dear Whitfordians are as great rogues as the tradesmen in town, and vastly less pleasant to deal with. They make us pay an enormous percentage for the trifling credit we take. So let \u0027em wait and be——paid! Dear Minnie, I assure you I shall not forget your affectionate kindness.\" He bent down over her as he said the last words, still holding her hands. A change in Minnie\u0027s face made him look round, and when he did so, he saw his wife standing just within the room behind him. Minnie was inexpressibly vexed with herself to feel a hot flush covering her face. She knew it would be misconstrued, and that made her colour the more. Mrs. Algernon Errington was the first to speak. \"I beg your pardon, Miss Bodkin,\" she said, \"I didn\u0027t know that you were so particularly engaged.\" \"What the deuce brought you here?\" asked her husband, with a not altogether successful assumption of thinking the whole trio, including himself, completely at their ease. \"There was no one in the drawing-room nor in the study,\" continued Castalia, still addressing Minnie, \"so I thought I would come direct to your room. I see now that I ought not to have taken that liberty.\" \"Well, frankly, I don\u0027t think you ought, my dear,\" said her husband, lightly. Minnie was sorely tempted to say so too. But she felt that any show of anger on her part would but increase the unpleasantness of the situation, and a quarrel with Algernon\u0027s wife under such circumstances would have been equally revolting to her pride and her taste; so she held out her hand to Castalia with grave courtesy, and said, \"I have to apologise, on my side, for having taken the privilege of old friendship to sermonise your husband a little. He will tell you what I have ventured to speak to him about. I hope you will forgive me.\" Castalia appeared not to see the proffered hand. She stood quite still near the door as she answered, \"Oh, I daresay it is all quite right. I don\u0027t suppose Ancram will tell me anything about it; I am not in his secrets.\" \"This is no secret, Mrs. Errington; at all events, not from you.\" \"Oh, I don\u0027t know. But I daresay it doesn\u0027t matter.\" Through all the languid insolence of her manner there was discernible so much real pain of mind, that Minnie once more checked a severe speech, and answered gently, \"You will judge of that. Of course Algernon will discuss the subject of our conversation with you.\" Mrs. Algernon Errington scarcely condescended to return Minnie\u0027s parting salutation, but walked away, saying to her husband over her shoulder, \"I am going to drive home. It is nearly dinner-time. I suppose you are coming? But don\u0027t let me interfere with your arrangements.\" \"Interfere with a fiddlestick!\" cried Algernon in the quick, testy tone that was the nearest approach to loss of temper Minnie had ever seen in him. Then he added after an instant, with a short laugh, \"I don\u0027t know why I\u0027m supposed not to include dinner in my \u0027arrangements\u0027 to-day of all days in the year!\" And then the husband and wife went away together, and entered the fly that awaited them before Dr. Bodkin\u0027s door. \"How did you know where to find me?\" asked Algernon suddenly, after a silent drive of some ten minutes. \"Oh, I knew you had a rendezvous.\" \"I had no \u0027rendezvous.\u0027 You could not know it!\" \"Couldn\u0027t I? I tell you I saw that creature\u0027s letter. \u0027Dear Algernon!\u0027 What right has she to write to you like that?\" And Castalia burst into angry tears. Algernon turned upon her eagerly. \"Saw her letter? Where? How?\" \"I——they told me——it was at the office.\" \"You went to the office? And you saw Minnie\u0027s letter?\" \"I——it\u0027s no use scolding me, or pretending to be injured. I know who is injured of us two.\" \"I suppose I must have left the note lying open on the table of my office,\" said Algernon, speaking very distinctly, and not looking at his wife. \"Yes; that must be it! I——I——I tore it up. You will find the fragments on the floor if you think them worth preserving.\" \"What a goose you are, Castalia!\" exclaimed her husband, leaning back in the carriage and closing his eyes. Now, the fact was that Algernon distinctly remembered having placed Minnie\u0027s note in a drawer of a little secretaire which he kept habitually locked, and of which the key was at that moment in his waistcoat pocket. And the discovery that his wife had in some way or other obtained access to the said secretaire gave him, for reasons known only to himself, abundant food for conjecture and reflection during the rest of the drive home.
