{"id":21632,"no":30,"title":"CHAPTER XI.","content":"It was true that Mrs. Algernon Errington had distinguished the Misses McDougall, by her notice, above all the other ladies whom she met at Dr. Bodkin\u0027s. The rest had by no means found favour in her eyes. Minnie Bodkin she decidedly disapproved of. Ally Dockett was \"a little black-eyed, fat, flirting thing.\" The elder ladies were frumps, or frights, or bores. Rhoda Maxfield she had scarcely seen. On the evening of the Bodkins\u0027 party, Rhoda, as we know, had kept herself studiously in the background. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Errington intended to present Rhoda to her daughter-in-law as her own especial pet and protégée, but a favourable moment for fulfilling this intention did not offer itself. Rhoda had not distinctly expressed any unwillingness to be taken to Ivy Lodge, and it could never enter into Mrs. Errington\u0027s head to guess that she felt such unwillingness. But in some way the project seemed to be eluded; so that Castalia had been some weeks in Whitford without making the acquaintance of Miss Maxfield, as she began to be called, even by some of those to whom she had been \"Old Max\u0027s little Rhoda\" all her life. \\n\\n \\n\\n Castalia, indeed, troubled her head very little about Rhoda, under whatever style or title she might be mentioned. We may be sure that Algernon never spoke to his wife of the old days at the Maxfields; indeed, he eschewed all allusion to that name as much as possible. Castalia knew from Mrs. Errington that there had been a young girl in the house where she had lodged, the daughter of the grocer, who was her landlord; but, being pretty well accustomed to Mrs. Errington\u0027s highly-coloured descriptions of things and people, she had paid no attention to that lady\u0027s praises of Rhoda\u0027s intelligence, good looks, and pretty manners. \\n\\n \\n\\n No; Castalia troubled not her head about Rhoda. But she was troubled about Minnie Bodkin, of whom she became bitterly jealous. She did not suppose, to be sure, that her husband had ever made love to Miss Bodkin; but she was constantly tormented by the suspicion that Algernon was admiring Minnie, and comparing her beauty, wit, and accomplishments with those of his wife, to the disadvantage of the latter. Not that she (Castalia) admired her. Far from it! But—she was just the sort of person to be taking with men. She had such a forward, confident, showy way with her! \\n\\n \\n\\n Some speech of this sort being uttered in the presence of the Misses McDougall, was seized upon, and echoed, and re-echoed, and made much of by those young ladies, who pounced on poor Minnie, and tore her to pieces with great skill and gusto. Violet, indeed, made a feeble protest now and then on behalf of her friend; but how was she to oppose her sister and that sweet Mrs. Algernon? And then, in conscience and candour, she could not but admit that poor dear Minnie had many and glaring faults. \\n\\n \\n\\n In fact, Rose and Violet McDougall were installed as toadies in ordinary to Castalia. They were her dearest friends; they called her by her Christian-name; they flattered her weaknesses, and encouraged her worst traits; not, we may charitably believe, with the full consciousness of what they were doing. For her part, Castalia soon got into the habit of liking to have these ladies about her. They performed many little offices which saved her trouble; they were devoted to her interests, and brought her news of the doings of the opposite faction. For there was an opposite faction; or Castalia persuaded herself that there was. The Bodkins were ranged in it, in her jealous fancy; and so were the Docketts, and one or two more of Algernon\u0027s old friends. Miss Chubb she considered to hover as yet on neutral ground. As to the unmarried men—young Pawkins, Mr. Diamond, and the curate of St. Chad\u0027s—they were not much taken into account in this species of subterranean warfare, carried on with an arsenal of sneers, stares, slights, hints, coolnesses, bridlings, envy, hatred, malice, and all uncharitableness. \\n\\n \\n\\n I have said that the warfare was subterranean; occult, as it were. Had the enemy been actuated by similar feelings to those of Castalia and her party, hostilities must have blazed up openly. But most of them did not even know that they were being assailed. Among these unconscious ones were Dr. and Mrs. Bodkin. Minnie had at times a suspicion that Algy\u0027s wife disliked her. But then the manners of Algy\u0027s wife were not genial or gracious to anyone, and Minnie could not but feel a certain compassion for her, which extinguished resentment at her sour words and ways. \\n\\n \\n\\n With the rest of the Whitford society, the bride did not enter into intimate, or even amicable, relations. She offended most of the worthy matrons who called on her by merely returning her card, and not even asking to be admitted to see them. As to offering any entertainment in return for the hospitalities that were offered to her during the first weeks that she dwelt in Whitford, that, Castalia said, was out of the question. How could more than two persons sit at table in her little dining-room? And how was it possible to receive company in Ivy Lodge? \\n\\n \\n\\n But Whitford was not quite of her opinion in this matter. It was true her rooms were small; but were they smaller than Mrs. Jones\u0027s, who gave three tea-parties every year, and received her friends in detachments? Why was Ivy Lodge less adapted for festive purposes than Dr. Smith\u0027s house in the High Street?—a queer, ancient, crooked nook of a dwelling, squeezed in between two larger neighbours, with a number of tiny dark rooms like closets; in which, nevertheless, some of the best crumpets and tea-cakes known to that community, not to mention little lobster suppers in the season, had been consumed by the Smiths\u0027 friends with much satisfaction. As Mrs. Dockett observed, it was not so much what you gave as the spirit you gave it in that mattered! And she was not ashamed, not she, to recall the time, in the beginning of Mr. Dockett\u0027s career, when she had with her own hands prepared a welsh rabbit and a jorum of spiced ale for a little party of friends, having nothing better to offer them for supper. In a word, it was Whitford\u0027s creed that even the most indigestible food, freely bestowed, might bless him that gave and him that received; and that if the Algernon Erringtons did not offer anyone so much as a cup of tea in their house, the real reason was to be sought in the lady\u0027s proud reserve and a general state of feeling which Mrs. Dockett described as \"stuck-upishness.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Castalia was unaccustomed to walking, and disliked that exercise. Riding was out of her power, no saddle-horse that would carry a lady being kept for hire in Whitford, and the jingling old fly from the \"Blue Bell\" inn was employed to carry her to such houses as she deigned to visit at. Her mother-in-law\u0027s lodging was not very frequently honoured by her presence. The stairs frightened her, she said; they were like a ladder. Mrs. Thimbleby\u0027s oblong drawing-room was a horrible little den. She had had no idea that ladies and gentlemen ever lived in such places. In truth, Castalia\u0027s anticipations of the Erringtons\u0027 domestic life at Whitford had by no means prepared her for the reality. Ancram had told her he was poor, certainly. Poor! Yes, but Jack Price was poor also. And Jack Price\u0027s valet was far better lodged than her mother-in-law. However, occasionally the jingling fly did draw up before the widow Thimbleby\u0027s door, and Castalia was seen to alight from it with a discontented expression of countenance, and to pick her way with raised skirts over the cleanly sanded doorstep. \\n\\n \\n\\n One day, when she entered the oblong drawing-room, Castalia perceived that Mrs. Errington was not there; but, instead of her, there was a young lady, sitting at work by the window, who lifted a lovely, blushing face as Castalia entered the room, and stammered out, in evident embarrassment, that Mrs. Errington would be there in a few minutes, and, meanwhile, would not the lady take a seat? \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I am Mrs. Ancram Errington,\" said Castalia, looking curiously at the girl. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes; I know. I—I saw you at Dr. Bodkin\u0027s. I am spending the day with Mrs. Errington. She is very kind to me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Algernon\u0027s wife seated herself in the easy-chair, and leisurely surveyed the young woman before her. Her first thought was, \"How well she\u0027s dressed!\" her second, \"She seems very bashful and timid; quite afraid of me!\" And this second thought was not displeasing to Mrs. Algernon; for, in general, she had not been treated by the \"provincial bumpkins,\" as she called them, with all the deference and submission due to her rank. \\n\\n \\n\\n The girl\u0027s hands were nervously occupied with some needlework. The flush had faded from her face, and left it delicately pale, except a faint rose-tint in the cheeks. Her shining brown hair waved in soft curls on to her neck. Mrs. Algernon sat looking at her, and critically observing the becoming hue of her green silk gown, the taste and richness of a gold brooch at her throat, the whiteness of the shapely hand that was tremulously plying the needle. All at once a guess came into her mind, and she asked, suddenly: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Is your name Maxfield?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes; Rhoda Maxfield,\" returned the girl, blushing more deeply and painfully than before. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why, I have heard of you!\" exclaimed Mrs. Algernon. \"You must come and see me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Rhoda was so alarmed at the pitch of agitation to which she was brought by this speech, that she made a violent effort to control it, and answered with, more calmness than she had hitherto displayed: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mrs. Errington has spoken once or twice of bringing me to your house; but—I did not like to intrude. And, besides——\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, Mrs. Errington brings all sorts of tiresome people to see me; she may as well bring a nice person for once in a way.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Castalia was meaning to be very gracious. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes; I mean—but then—my father might not like me to come and see you,\" blurted out Rhoda, with a sort of quiet desperation. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Algernon opened her eyes very wide. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why, for goodness\u0027 sake? Oh, he had some quarrel or other with Mrs. Errington, hadn\u0027t he? Never mind, that must be all forgotten, or he wouldn\u0027t let you come here. I believe the truth is, that Mrs. Errington meant slyly to keep you to herself, and I shan\u0027t stand that.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Indeed, Castalia more than half believed this to be the case. And, partly from a sheer spirit of opposition to her mother-in-law—partly from the suspicious jealousy of her nature, that led her to do those things which she fancied others cunningly wished to prevent her from doing—she began to think she would patronise Rhoda and enlist her into her own faction. Besides, Rhoda was sweet-voiced, submissive, humble. Certainly, she would be a pleasanter sort of pet and tame animal to encourage about the house than Rose McDougall, who, with all her devotion, claimed a quid pro quo for her services, and dwelt on her kinship with the daughter of Lord Kauldkail, and talked of their \"mutual ancestry\" to an extent that Castalia had begun to consider a bore. \\n\\n \\n\\n At this moment Mrs. Errington bustled into the room, holding a small roll of yellow lace in her hand. \"I have found it, Rhoda,\" she cried. \"This little bit is nearly the same pattern as the trimming on the cap, and, if we join the frilling——\" Here she perceived Mrs. Algernon\u0027s presence, and stopped her speech with an exclamation of surprise: \"Good gracious! is that you, Castalia? How long have you been here? This is an unexpected pleasure. Now you can give us your advice about the trimming of my cap, which Rhoda has undertaken for me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Castalia did not rise from the easy-chair, but turned her cheek to receive the elder lady\u0027s kiss. Rhoda gathered up her work, and moved to go away. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t run away, Rhoda!\" cried Mrs. Errington. \"We have no secrets to talk, have we, Castalia? You know my little friend Rhoda, do you not? She is a great pet of mine?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, I will go and sit in your bedroom, if I may,\" muttered Rhoda, hurriedly. \"I—I don\u0027t like to be in your way.\" And with a little confused courtesy to Mrs. Algernon, she slipped out of the room and closed the door behind her. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"She is such a shy little thing!\" exclaimed Mrs. Errington. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well,\" returned Castalia, \"it is a comfort to meet with any Whitford person that knows her place! They are the most presumptuous set of creatures, in general, that I ever came across.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, Rhoda Maxfield\u0027s manners are never at fault, I assure you; I formed her myself, with considerable care and pains.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"She seems to make herself useful, too!\" observed Castalia with a languid sneer. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That she does, indeed, my dear! Most useful. Her taste and skill in any little matter of needlework are quite extraordinary. Poor child! she is so delighted to do anything for me. She is devotedly attached to me, and very grateful. Her father really did behave abominably, and she feels it very much, and wishes to make up for it. No doubt the old man repents of his folly and ill-humour now; but, of course, I can have nothing more to say to him. However, I willingly allow the girl to do any little thing she can. She has just been trimming this cap for me most exquisitely!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Castalia thought, more and more, that it would be worth her while to patronise Rhoda. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I shall go to old Maxfield myself, and get him to let her come to my house,\" said she, as she took leave of her mother-in-law, and slowly made her way down Mrs. Thimbleby\u0027s ladder-like staircase, holding fast to the banisters with one hand, and not lifting one of her feet from a step until the other was firmly planted beside it. \\n\\n \\n\\n On returning home that evening, Rhoda was greatly startled by her father\u0027s words, \"Well, Miss Maxfield, here\u0027s a honourable missis been begging for the pleasure of your company!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Rhoda turned pale and red, and said something in too low a tone to meet her father\u0027s ear. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh yes,\" the old man went on; \"the Honourable Mrs. Algernon Ancram Errington has been here, if you please! Well, I wish that young man joy of his bargain! Our little Sally is ten times as well-favoured. Your Aunt Betty saw her first; and, says she, \u0027Is Mr. Maxfield at home?\u0027\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I answered that your father was engaged in business,\" said Betty Grimshaw, taking up the narration. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You should ha\u0027 said I was serving in the shop,\" observed old Max, doggedly, \"and would sell her fine ladyship a penn\u0027orth of gingerbread if she\u0027d a mind, and could find the penny!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Nay, Jonathan, how could I have said that to the lady? Says she, \u0027I wish to say a word to him.\u0027 So I showed her into your drawing-room, Rhoda, and called your father, and——\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And there she sat,\" interrupted the old man, with unwonted eagerness in his face and his voice, \"in a far better place than any she has of her own, if all accounts are true, looking about her as curious as a ferret. I walked in, in my calico sleeves and my apron——\" \\n\\n \\n\\n (\"He wouldn\u0027t take them off,\" put in Betty, parenthetically.) \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No; I wouldn\u0027t. And she told me she was come to ask my leave to have my daughter Rhoda at her house. \u0027Of course you\u0027ll let her come,\u0027 she says, \u0027for you let her go to Mrs. Errington\u0027s and to Mrs. Bodkin\u0027s?\u0027 \u0027Why, as to that,\u0027 says I, \u0027I\u0027m rather partic\u0027lar where Miss Maxfield visits.\u0027 You should have seen her stare. She looked fairly astounded.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, father!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Did I not speak the truth? I am partic\u0027lar where you visit. I told her plainly that you was in a very different position from the rest of the family. \u0027I am a plain tradesman,\u0027 said I. \u0027I have my own place and my own influence, and I have been marvellously upholden in my walk of light. But my daughter Rhoda is a lady of the Lord\u0027s own making, and must be treated as such. And she has plenty of this world\u0027s gear, for my endeavours have been abundantly blessed.\u0027\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, father!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Oh, father!\u0027\" repeated the old man, impatiently. \"What did I say amiss? I tell you the woman was cowed by me. I am in subjection to none of their principalities and powers. The upshot was that I promised you should go and take tea with her to-morrow evening.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Rhoda was greatly surprised by this announcement, which was totally unexpected. \"Oh, father!\" she exclaimed in a trembling voice, \"why did you say I should go?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why? For various sufficient reasons. Let that be enough for you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The truth was, that Castalia had more than hinted her suspicion that her mother-in-law selfishly endeavoured to keep Rhoda under her own influence, and to prevent her visiting elsewhere. And to thwart Mrs. Errington would alone have been a powerful incentive with old Max. But a far stronger motive with him was that he longed, with keen malice, that Algernon should be forced painfully to contrast the love he had been false to with the wife he had gained. He would have Algernon see Rhoda rich, and well-dressed, and courted. If Rhoda would but have flaunted her prosperity in Algernon\u0027s face, there was scarcely any sum of money her father would have grudged for the pleasure of witnessing that spectacle. But, although it was hopeless to expect Rhoda to display any spirit of vengeance on her own behalf, yet she might be made the half-unconscious instrument of a retribution that should gall and mortify Algernon to the quick. That Rhoda herself might suffer in the process was an idea to which (if it occurred to him) he would give no harbourage. \\n\\n \\n\\n Rhoda sat silent until her aunt had left the room to prepare the supper according to her habit. Then she rose, and, going close up to her father, took his hand, and looked imploringly into his face. \"Father,\" she said, \"don\u0027t make me go there. I—I can\u0027t bear it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You can\u0027t bear it!\" burst out old Maxfield. He scowled with a frown of terrible malignity. But Rhoda well knew that his wrath was not directed against her. She stood trembling and pale before him, whilst he spoke more harsh and bitter words against all the family of the Erringtons than she had ever heard him utter on that score. He dropped, too, for the first time in her hearing, a hint that he had some power over Algernon, and would use it to his detriment. Rhoda mustered courage to ask him for an explanation of those words. But he merely answered, \"No matter. It is no matter. It is not the money. I shall not get it, nor do I greatly heed it. But I can put him to shame publicly, if I am so minded.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The poor child began to perceive that any display of wounded feeling on her part, of reluctance to meet Algernon and his wife, of being in any degree crushed and dispirited, would inflame her father\u0027s wrath against that family. And, although she had only the vaguest notions as to what he could or could not do to spite them, she had a hundred reasons for wishing to mitigate his animosity. \\n\\n \\n\\n So, with the gentle cunning that belonged to her nature, at once timid and persistent, she began to unsay what she had said, and to try to efface the impression which her first refusal had made upon her father. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I—I have been thinking that you are right, father, in saying it will be best for me to go to Ivy Lodge. You know Mrs. Errington has always been good to me, and it would please her, perhaps. And—and, after all, why should I be afraid of going there?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Afraid of going there!\" echoed old Max, with sternly-set jaw and puckered brow. \"Why, indeed, should you be afraid? There\u0027s some as have reason to be afraid, but not my daughter—not Miss Maxfield. Afraid!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Perhaps people might think it strange if I did not go?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"People! What people?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, no matter for that. But if you, father, think it well that I should go——\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You shall go in a carriage from the \u0027Blue Bell\u0027 inn. And Sally shall accompany you and bring you back. And see that you are properly attired. I would have you wear your best garments. You shall not be shamed before that yellow-faced woman. I don\u0027t believe she has a better gown to her back than the one I bought you to wear at Dr. Bodkin\u0027s.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Rhoda waived the point for the moment; but, after a while, she was able to persuade her father that her grey merino gown, with a lace frill at her throat, was a more suitable garment in which to spend the evening at Ivy Lodge than the rich violet silk he recommended for the purpose. Real ladies, she urged timidly, did not wear their smartest clothes on such occasions. And old Max reluctantly accepted her dictum on this point. But nothing could shake him from his resolve that Rhoda should be conveyed to Mrs. Algernon Errington\u0027s door in a hired carriage. So, with a sigh, she yielded; devoutly wishing that a pelting shower of rain, or even a thunderstorm, might arrive the next evening, to serve as an excuse for her appearing at Ivy Lodge in such unwonted state. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2168/61291.html","bookId":444,"book":{"id":444,"title":"A Charming Fellow","description":"简介： The room was very quiet.
