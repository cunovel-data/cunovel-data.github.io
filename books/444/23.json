{"id":21625,"no":23,"title":"CHAPTER IV.","content":"Time passed, or seemed to pass, with unusual gentleness over Whitford. If some of our acquaintances there had suddenly been called upon to mention the changes that had taken place within two years, they would perhaps have said at first that there had been none. But changes there had been, nevertheless; and by a few dwellers in the little town they had been keenly felt. The second summer vacation after that happy holiday time which Rhoda had passed with the Erringtons at Llanryddan arrived. A hot July, winged with thunder-clouds, brooded over the meadows by the Whit. The shadow of Pudcombe Woods was pleasant in the sultry afternoons, and the cattle stood for hours knee-deep in dark pools, overhung by drooping boughs. The great school-room at the Grammar School resounded no more with the tread of young feet, or the murmur of young voices. It was empty, and silent, and dusty; and an overgrown spider had thrown his grey tapestry right across the oriel window, so that it was painted, warp and woof, with brave purple and ruby blazonries from the old stained glass. Dr. Bodkin and his family were away at a seaside place in the South of England. Mr. Diamond had gone on a solitary excursion afoot. Even Pudcombe Hall was deserted; although young Pawkins was expected to return thither, later in the season, for the shooting. Rhoda Maxfield had been sent to her half-brother Seth, at Duckwell Farm, to get strong and sunburned; and as she was allowed to be by herself almost as much as she wished—Mrs. Seth Maxfield being a bustling, active woman, who would not have thought of suspending or modifying her daily avocations for the sake of entertaining any visitor whatever—Rhoda spent her time, not unhappily, in a sort of continuous day-dream, sitting with a book of poetry under a hedge in the hayfield, or wandering with her little nephew, Seth Maxfield the younger, in Pudcombe Woods, which were near her brother\u0027s farm. She liked looking back better than looking forward, perhaps; and enacted in her imagination many a scene that had occurred at dear Llanryddan over and over again. But still there were many times when she indulged in hopeful anticipations as to Algy\u0027s return. He had come back to London after his foreign travel, and had spent another brilliant season under the patronage of his great relations. And then a rumour had reached Whitford that Lord Seely had at length obtained the promise of a good post for him, and that he might be expected to revisit Whitford in the autumn at latest. Mrs. Errington had been invited to a country house of Lord Seely\u0027s, in Westmoreland, to meet her son, and had set out on her visit in high spirits. Rhoda was thus cut off from hearing frequently of Algernon, through his mother, but she looked forward to seeing them together in September. Rhoda missed her friend and patroness; but she missed her less at Duckwell than she would have done in the dull house in the High Street. On the whole, she was not unhappy during those sultry summer weeks. Modest and humble-minded as she was, she had come to understand that she was considered pretty and pleasing by the ladies and gentlemen whose acquaintance she had made. No caressing words, no flattering epithets, no pet names, had been bestowed upon her by her father\u0027s old friends and companions. She was just simply Rhoda Maxfield to them; never \"Primrose,\" or \"Pretty one,\" or \"Rhoda dear;\" and the Methodists, however blind to her attractive qualities, had displayed considerable vigilance in pointing out her backsliding, and exhorting her to make every effort to become convinced of sin. Certainly the society of ladies and gentlemen was infinitely more agreeable. Then, too, there had dawned on her some idea that Mr. Diamond felt a warm admiration for her—perhaps something even warmer than admiration. Miss Chubb (who delighted to foster any amatory sentiments which she might observe in the young persons around her, and was fond of saying, with a languishing droop of her plump, rubicund, good-humoured countenance, that she would not for the world see other young hearts blighted by early disappointment, as hers had been) had dropped several hints to that effect sufficiently broad to be understood even by the bashful Rhoda. And, a little to her own surprise, Rhoda had felt something like gratification, in consequence; Mr. Diamond was such a very clever gentleman. Although he wasn\u0027t rich, yet everybody thought a great deal of him. Even Dr. Bodkin (decidedly the most awful embodiment of authority whom Rhoda had ever yet known) treated Mr. Diamond with consideration. And Miss Minnie was his intimate friend. Rhoda had not the least idea of ever reciprocating Mr. Diamond\u0027s sentiments. But she could not help feeling that the existence of those sentiments increased her own importance in the world. And she had a lurking idea that it might, if known to Algy, increase her importance in his eyes also. As to Mr. Diamond\u0027s part in the matter, Rhoda, to say truth, concerned herself very little with that. Partly from a humble estimate of herself, and partly from that maiden incapacity for conceiving the fire and force of a masculine passion, which often makes girls pass for cruel who are only childish, she never had thought of Mr. Diamond as seriously suffering for her sake. But yet she was less cold and repellent to him than she had once been. It is difficult not to thaw somewhat in the presence of one whose words and looks make a genial atmosphere for that sensitive plant—youthful vanity. Rhoda\u0027s wardrobe, which by this time had become considerable in quantity and tasteful in quality, was a great source of amusement to her. She delighted to trim, and stitch, and alter, and busy her fingers with the manufacture of bright-coloured bows of ribbon and dainty muslin frills. Mrs. Seth looked contemptuous at what she called \"Rhoda\u0027s finery,\" and told her she would never do for a farmer\u0027s wife if she spent so much time over a parcel of frippery. Seth Maxfield shook his head gravely, and hoped that Rhoda was not given up utterly to worldliness and vanity; but feared that she had learnt no good at St. Chad\u0027s church, but had greatly backslided since the days of her attendance at chapel. For the Seth Maxfields still belonged to the Wesleyan connexion, and disapproved of the change that had taken place among the family at Whitford. Not that Seth was a deeply religious man. But his father\u0027s desertion of the Wesleyans appeared to him in the light of a party defection. It was \"ratting;\" and ratting, as Seth thought, without the excuse of a bribe. \"Look how well father has prospered!\" he would say to his wife. \"He\u0027s as warm a man, is father, as \u0027ere a one in Whitford. And the Church folks bought their tea and sugar of him all the same when he belonged to the Society. But I don\u0027t believe the Society will spend their money with him now as they did. So that\u0027s so much clean lost. I\u0027m not so strict as some, myself; nor I don\u0027t see the use of it. But I do think a man ought to stick to what he\u0027s been brought up to. \u0027Specially when it\u0027s had the manifest blessing of Providence! If the Lord was so well satisfied with father being a Wesleyan, I think father might ha\u0027 been satisfied too.\" Still there had been no quarrel between the Whitford Maxfields and those of Duckwell. They came together so seldom that opportunities for quarrelling were rare. And Seth had too great a respect for such manifestations of Providential approbation as had been vouchsafed to his father, to be willing to break entirely with the old man. So, when old Max proposed to send Rhoda to the farm for a few weeks, he paying a weekly stipend for her board, his son and his son\u0027s wife had at once agreed to the proposition. And as they were not persons who brought their religious theories into the practical service of daily life, Rhoda\u0027s conscience was not disturbed by having a high and stern standard of duty held up for her attainment at every moment. The Wesleyan preacher at that time in the district was a frequent guest at Duckwell Farm. And in the long summer evenings one or two neighbours would occasionally drop in to the cool stone-flagged parlour, where brother Jackson would read a chapter and offer up a prayer. And afterwards there would be smoking of pipes and drinking of home-brewed by the men; while Mrs. Seth and Rhoda would sit on a bench in the apple-orchard, near to the open window of the parlour, and sew, and talk, or listen to the conversation from within, as they pleased. Rhoda perceived quickly enough that the Duckwell Farm species of Methodism was very different from the Methodism of David Powell. Mr. Jackson never said anything to frighten her. He talked, indeed, of sin, and of the dangers that beset sinners; but he never spoke as if they were real to him—as if he heard and saw all the terrible things he discoursed of so glibly. Then Mr. Jackson was, Rhoda thought, a somewhat greedy eater. He did not smoke, it was true; but he took a good share of Seth\u0027s strong ale, and was not above indulging in gossip—perhaps to please himself, perhaps to please Mrs. Seth Maxfield. Rhoda drew a comparison in her own mind between brother Jackson and the stately rector of St. Chad\u0027s, and felt much satisfaction at the contrast between them. How much nicer it was to be a member of a Church of England congregation; where one heard Dr. Bodkin or Mr. Warlock speak a not too long discourse in correct English, and with that refined accent which Rhoda\u0027s ear had learned to prize, and where the mellow old organ made a quivering atmosphere of music that seemed to mingle with the light from the painted windows; than to sit on a deal bench in a white-washed chapel, and painfully keep oneself broad awake whilst brother Jackson or brother Hinks bawled out a series of disjointed sentences, beginning with \"Oh!\" and displaying a plentiful lack of aspirates! On the whole, perhaps, her stay at Duckwell Farm was a potent agent in confirming Rhoda in orthodox views of religion. Generally, as she sat beside Mrs. Seth in the parlour, or on the bench outside the window, Rhoda withdrew her attention from the talk of brother Jackson and the others. She could think her own thoughts, and dream her own dreams, whilst she was knitting a stocking or hemming a pinafore for little Seth. But sometimes a name was mentioned at these meetings that she could not hear with indifference. It was the name of David Powell. The tone in which he was spoken of now was very opposite to the chorus of praise which had accompanied every mention of him among the Whitford Methodists, two years ago. There were rumours that he had defied the authority of Conference, and intended to secede from the Society. He was said to have been preaching strange doctrine in the remote parts of Wales, and to have caused and encouraged extravagant manifestations, such as were known to have prevailed at the preachings of Berridge and Hickes, seventy or eighty years ago; and earlier still, at the first open-air sermons of John Wesley himself, at Bristol. Brother Jackson shook his head, and pursed up his lips at the rumours. He had never much approved of Powell; and Seth Maxfield had distinctly disapproved of him. Seth had been brought up in the old sleepy days, when members of the Society in Whitford were comfortably undisturbed by the voice of an \"awakening\" preacher. He had resented the fuss that had been made about David Powell. He had been still more annoyed by his father\u0027s secession, which he attributed to Powell\u0027s over zeal and presumption. And he, by his own example, encouraged a hostile and critical tone in speaking of the preacher. There was, indeed, but one voice raised in his defence in the parlour at Duckwell Farm. This was the voice of Richard Gibbs, the head groom at Pudcombe Hall, who sometimes came over to Duckwell to join in the prayer-meetings there. Although Richard Gibbs was but a servant, he was a trusted and valued one; and he was received by the farmer and his wife with considerable civility. Richard \"knew his place,\" as Mrs. Seth said, and was not \"one of them as if you give \u0027em an inch they\u0027ll take an ell.\" And then he had a considerable knowledge of farriery, and had more than once given good advice to Farmer Maxfield respecting the treatment of sick horses and cattle. Seth was fond of repeating that he himself was \"not so strict as some,\" finding, indeed, that a reputation for strictness, in a Methodistical sense, put him at a disadvantage with his fellow farmers on market-days. But whenever Richard Gibbs was spoken of, he would add to this general disclaimer of peculiar piety on his own part, \"Not, mind you, but what there\u0027s some as conversion does a wonderful deal for, to this day, thanks be! Why, there\u0027s Dicky Gibbs, head-groom at Pudcombe Hall. Talk of blasphemers—well Dicky was a blasphemer! And now his lips are as pure from evil speaking as my little maid\u0027s there. And he\u0027s the only man I ever knew as had to do with horses that wouldn\u0027t tell you a lie. At first, I believe, there was some at the Hall—I name no names—didn\u0027t like Dicky\u0027s plain truths. There was a carriage-horse to be sold, and Dicky spoke out and told this and that, and young master couldn\u0027t get his price. But in the long run it answers. Oh! I\u0027m not against a fervent conversion, nor yet against conviction of sin—for some.\" So Richard Gibbs sat many a summer evening in the flagged parlour at Duckwell Farm, and his melancholy, clean-shaven, lantern-jawed face was a familiar spectacle at prayer-meetings there. \"I have been much grieved and exercised in spirit on behalf of brother Powell,\"\u0027 said Mr. Jackson, in his thick voice. The expounding and the prayers were over. Seth had lighted his pipe; so had Roger Heath, the baker, from Pudcombe village. A great cool jug of ale stood on the table, and the setting sun sent his rays into the room, tempered by a screen of jessamine and vine leaves that hung down outside the window. \"Ah! And reason too!\" said Seth gruffly. \"He\u0027s been getting further and further out of the right furrow this many a day.\" \"They do say,\" observed sour-faced Roger Heath, \"that there\u0027s dreadful scenes with them poor Welsh at his field-preachings. Men and women stricken down like bullocks, and screechings and convulsions, like as if they was all possessed with the devil.\" \"Lauk!\" cried Mrs. Seth eagerly. \"Why, how is that, then?\" Rhoda, listening outside, behind the screen of vine leaves at the open window, could not repress a shudder at the thought that, had David Powell shown this new power of his a year or two ago, she herself might have been among the convulsed who bore testimony to his terrible influence. \"How is that, Mrs. Maxfield?\" returned Richard Gibbs. \"Why, how can it be, except by abounding grace!\" \"Nay, Mr. Gibbs, but how dreadful it seems, don\u0027t it? Just think of falling down in a fit in the open field!\" \"Just think of living and dying unawakened to sin! Is not that a hundred thousand times more dreadful?\" \"I hope it don\u0027t need to roll about like Bedlamites to be awakened to a sense of sin, Mr. Gibbs!\" cried Seth Maxfield. \"The Lord forbid!\" ejaculated brother Jackson. \"A likely tale!\" added Mrs. Seth, cheerfully. \"I\u0027m against all such doings,\" said Roger Heath, shaking his head. \"But if it be the Lord\u0027s doing, sir?\" remonstrated Richard Gibbs, speaking slowly, and with an anxious lack-lustre gaze at the white-washed ceiling, as though counsel might be read there. \"And I\u0027ve heard tell that John Wesley did the same at his field-preachings.\" Brother Jackson hastily wiped his mouth, after a deep draught of ale, before replying, \"That was in the beginning, when such things may have been needful. But now, I fear, they only bring scandal upon us, and strengthen scoffers.\" \"I tell you what it is,\" said Seth, taking the pipe from his mouth, and waving it up and down to emphasise his words, \"it\u0027s my opinion as David Powell\u0027s not quite—not quite right in his head.\" \"\u0027Taint the first time that thought has crossed my mind,\" said the baker, who had once upon a time been uneasy under the yoke of Powell\u0027s stern views as to weights and measures. \"Of course,\" pursued Seth, argumentatively, \"we\u0027ve got to draw a line. Religion is one thing and rampaging is another. From the first, when Powell began rampaging, I mistrusted what it would come to.\" \"The human brain is a very delicate and mysterious organ,\" said brother Jackson. \"Ah!\" ejaculated Heath, with an air of profundity, as of one the extent of whose acquaintance with the human brain was not easily to be set forth in words, \"you may well say so, sir. There you\u0027re right, indeed, brother Jackson.\" \"Why, there it is!\" cried Seth. \"And Powell, he overtaxed the human brain. It\u0027s like flying in the face of Providence almost, to want to go so much beyond your neighbours. Why, he\u0027d fast till he well-nigh starved himself.\" \"But he gave all he spared from his own stomach to the poor,\" put in Gibbs, looking sad and perplexed. \"I call all that rampaging,\" returned Seth, with a touch of his father\u0027s obstinacy. \"Dr. Evans read out an account of these doings in Wales from a newspaper in Mr. Barker the chemist\u0027s shop in Whitford last Saturday,\" said Heath. \"I heard it. And Dr. Evans said it was catching, and that such-like excitement was dangerous, for you never know where it might end. And Dr. Evans is of a Welsh family himself,\" he added, bringing out this clause, as though it strikingly illustrated or elucidated the topic under discussion. Mrs. Seth drew her little boy close to her, and covered his curly poll with her large maternal hand, as though to protect the little \"human brain\" within from all danger. \"Mercy me!\" she said, \"I hope Powell won\u0027t come into these parts any more! I should be frightened to go to chapel, or to let the children go either.\" \"Oh, you need not be alarmed, Mrs. Maxfield,\" said brother Jackson, with a superior smile. \"Nay, but if it is catching, Mr. Jackson!\" persisted the anxious mother. \"Tut, lass! It isn\u0027t like measles!\" said her husband. The ale being by this time exhausted and the pipes smoked out, brother Jackson rose to depart, and the baker went away with him. Seth Maxfield detained Gibbs for a few minutes to ask his advice about a favourite cart-horse. \"Well, Mr. Gibbs,\" said the housewife, when, the conference being over, he bade her \"Good evening,\" \"and when are your folks coming back to the Hall?\" \"Not just yet, ma\u0027am. Young master is gone to Westmoreland, I hear, to a wedding at some nobleman\u0027s house there. He\u0027ll be back at Pudcombe for the shooting.\" \"A wedding, eh?\" said Mrs. Seth, with eager feminine interest in the topic. \"Not his own wedding, I suppose?\" \"Oh no, ma\u0027am. \u0027Tis some friend of his, I believe, that he knew at Whitford; Erringham, I think the name is—a young gentleman that\u0027s going to marry the nobleman\u0027s niece. The housekeeper at the Hall was telling some of my fellow-servants about it the other day. But I\u0027m ill at remembering the chat I hear. And \u0027tis unprofitable work too. Good evening, ma\u0027am. Farewell, Seth,\" stooping down to pat the little one\u0027s curly head. \"May the Lord bless and keep you!\" Mrs. Seth stood out in the apple-orchard, with two of her children clinging to her skirts, and held up her hand to shade her eyes as she watched the departing figure of Richard Gibbs moving across the meadow, in the rosy evening light. Then she turned to the wooden bench where Rhoda was sitting, huddled together, with her work lying in her lap. \"You didn\u0027t come in to prayers, Rhoda,\" said her sister-in-law. \"But, however, you can hear it all just as well outside, as in. If it wasn\u0027t for civility to Mr. Jackson, I\u0027d liefer stay out here these fine summer evenings, myself. And I was thinking—why, child, what a white face you\u0027ve got! Like a sheet of white paper, for all the world! And your hands are quite cold, though it\u0027s been downright sultry! Mercy me, don\u0027t go and get sick on our hands, Rhoda! What will your father say? Come, you\u0027d best get to bed, and I\u0027ll make you a hot posset myself.\" Rhoda passively followed her sister-in-law to the fresh lavender-scented chamber which she occupied; and she consented to go to bed at once. Her head ached, she said, but she declined the hot posset, and only asked to be left quiet. \"There\u0027s always some bother with girls of that delicate sort,\" said Mrs. Seth to her husband, when she went downstairs again. \"Rhoda\u0027s mother was just such another; looked as if you might blow her away. I can\u0027t think whatever made your father marry her! Not but Rhoda\u0027s a nice-tempered girl enough, and very patient with the children. But, do you know, Seth, I\u0027m afraid she\u0027s got a chill or something, sitting out in the orchard so late.\" \"What makes you think so?\" \"Well, she had a queer, scared kind of look on her face.\" \"Nonsense! Catching cold don\u0027t make people look scared.\" \"Something makes her look scared, I tell you. It\u0027s either she\u0027s sickening for some fever, or else she\u0027s seen a ghost!\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2168/61284.html","bookId":444,"book":{"id":444,"title":"A Charming Fellow","description":"简介： The room was very quiet.
