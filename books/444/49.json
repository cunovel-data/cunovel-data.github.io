{"id":21651,"no":49,"title":"CHAPTER XIII.","content":"The days passed by and brought no letter, in answer to Castalia\u0027s, from Lord Seely. Dreary were the hours in Ivy Lodge. The wife was devoured by passionate jealousy and a vain yearning for affection; the husband found that even the bright, smooth, hard metal of his own character was not impervious to the corrosive action of daily cares, regrets, and apprehensions. Algernon was not apt to hate. He usually perceived the absurd side of persons who were obnoxious to him with too keen an amusement to detest them; and the inmost feeling of his heart with respect to his fellow-creatures in general approached, perhaps, as nearly to perfect indifference as it is given to a mortal to attain. But it was not possible to preserve a condition of indifference towards Castalia. She was a thorn in his flesh, a mote in his eye, a weariness to his spirit; and he began to dislike the very sight of the sallow, sickly face, red-eyed too often, and haggard with discontent, that met his view whenever he was in his own home. It was the daily \"worry\" of it, he told himself, that was unendurable. It was the being shut up with her in a box like Ivy Lodge, where there was no room for them to get away from each other. If he could have shared a mansion in Grosvenor Square with Castalia he might have got on with her well enough! But then, that mansion in Grosvenor Square would have made so many things different in his life. \\n\\n \\n\\n At length one day came a letter to Castalia, with the London post-mark and sealed with the well-known coat of arms, but it did not bear Lord Seely\u0027s frank. Another name was scrawled in the corner, and the direction was written in Lady Seely\u0027s crooked, cramped little characters. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m afraid Uncle Val must be ill!\" exclaimed Castalia, opening the letter with a trembling hand. She was so weak and nervous now that the most trifling agitation made her heart beat painfully. My lady\u0027s epistle was not long, and, as a knowledge of its contents is essential to the due comprehension of this story, it is given in full, with her ladyship\u0027s own phraseology and orthography:— \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My dear Castalia,—I cannot think what on earth you are about to write such letters to your uncle. Go abroad, indeed! I suppose Ancram would like the embassy to St. Petersburg, or to be governor of the Ionian Islands. It\u0027s all nonsense, and you had better put such ideas out of your head at once, and for all. I should think you might know that we have other people to think of besides your husband, especially after all we have done for him. Your uncle is very ill in bed with an attack of the gout, and can\u0027t write himself. The doctor thinks he won\u0027t be about again for weeks. You can guess what trouble this throws on to my shoulders, so I hope you won\u0027t worry me by any more such letters as the last. As if there was not anxiety enough, Fido had a fit on Thursday. I hope you are pretty well. What a blessing you\u0027ve no sign of a family. With only you two to keep, you ought to do very well on Ancram\u0027s salary, and you can tell him I say so. Yours affectionately, \\n\\n \\n\\n \"B. Seely.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Poor Uncle Val!\" exclaimed Castalia, dropping the letter from her hand. \"I was afraid he was ill.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Pshaw! A touch of the gout won\u0027t kill him,\" said Algernon, who had been reading over her shoulder. \"But it\u0027s deuced unfortunate for me that he should be laid up at this time, and quite helpless in the hands of that old catamaran.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Poor Uncle Val! Perhaps he never got my letter at all.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Nothing more likely, if my lady could prevent his getting it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Perhaps, when he gets better, I can write to him again, and ask him——\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"When he gets better? Oh yes, certainly. We have plenty of time. There is no hurry, of course!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I see that you are speaking satirically, Ancram, but I don\u0027t know why.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Her husband shrugged his shoulders and walked out of the room. As he left the house he was met at the garden-gate by a bright-eyed, consumptive-looking lad, in shabby working clothes, who touched his cap, and held out a paper to Algernon. \"What do you want?\" asked the latter. \"Mr. Gladwish, sir. His account, if you please, sir.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And who the devil is Mr. Gladwish?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The shoemaker, sir.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh! Mr. Gladwish, then, is an extremely importunate, impatient, troublesome fellow. This is the third or fourth time within a very few weeks that he has sent in his bill. I\u0027m not accustomed to that sort of thing. I don\u0027t understand it. Don\u0027t give me the paper, boy. Take it into the house.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Please, sir,\" began the lad, and stopped, hesitatingly. Then seeing that Mr. Errington was walking off without taking any further notice of him, he repeated in a louder, firmer tone, \"Please, sir, Mr. Gladwish is really in want of the money. He has two of the children bad with fever. And I was to say that even five pounds on account would be acceptable.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Five pounds! He\u0027s too modest. I haven\u0027t got five pounds, nor five minutes. I\u0027m busy.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then, I\u0027m sorry to say, sir, that Mr. Gladwish will take legal proceedings for the debt at once. He told me to tell you so.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Nice state of things!\" muttered Algernon, as he walked towards the post-office, with his head bent down and his hands deep in his pockets. \"But that\u0027s nothing. It\u0027s those cursed bills in Maxfield\u0027s hands that are on my mind like lead.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n His spirits were not lightened by that which awaited him at the office. He had to undergo an interview with the district surveyor, who was very grave, not to say severe, in speaking of the irregularities which had been complained of, and were looked on as very serious at the head office. The surveyor ended by plainly hinting his hope that persons having no business at the office would be strictly forbidden from having access to it at abnormal hours. \"I—I don\u0027t understand you,\" stammered Algernon. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mr. Errington,\" said the surveyor, \"I am speaking to you, not officially, but confidentially, and as man to man. I have been having a little conversation with Mr. Gibbs—who seems to have none but good feeling towards you, but who—in short, I think it is not needful to be more explicit. I advise you in all friendliness to be stern and decisive in keeping every person out of this office except such as have recognised business to be here. If further trouble arises, I shall have to do my duty, and make my report without respect of any persons whatsoever.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Perhaps,\" said Algernon, who was white to his lips, but otherwise apparently unmoved, \"perhaps it would be best for me to resign my post here at once. If the authorities above me find cause for dissatisfaction——\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I can give you no advice as to that, Mr. Errington. You must know your own affairs better than I do.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There are things which a man can scarcely say even to himself; considerations which are painful as they float dimly in one\u0027s own mind, but which would be unendurable uttered aloud in words. Anything like a public scandal—or—or—disgrace to me, would involve a large circle of persons—many of them persons of rank and consideration in the world. You are possibly aware that—my wife\"—there was a peculiar tone in Algernon\u0027s voice as he said these two words—\"is a niece of Lord Seely?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n But the official gentleman declined to enter into the question of Mr. Errington\u0027s family connections. \"Oh,\" said he, coldly; \"we must hope there will be no question of scandal or disgrace.\" Then he went away, leaving Algernon in a chaos of doubt as to whether he should, or should not, speak further on the subject to Obadiah Gibbs. Obadiah Gibbs, however, decided the question for him. He came into Algernon\u0027s room, closing the door carefully behind him, and asked to speak a few words in private. Algernon was sitting in the luxurious easy-chair which he had had carried into the office for his own use. It was about three o\u0027clock in the afternoon of a dull November day. The single window which looked on to a white-washed court threw a ghastly pallid light on Algernon\u0027s face as he sat opposite to it, with his head thrown back against the cushions of the high chair. Mr. Gibbs was touched with compassion at seeing how changed the bright young face looked since he had first been acquainted with it. And yet, in truth, the change was not a very deep one: it was more in colouring, and the expression of the moment, than in any lines which care had graven. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Come in, Gibbs; come in,\" said Algernon, with his affable air. The clerk seemed the more anxious and disturbed of the two. He sat down on the chair Algernon pointed out to him in a constrained posture, and seemed to have some difficulty in beginning to speak, albeit not a man usually liable to embarrassment of manner. His superior stretched his feet out nearer to the hearth, and slightly moved his white hand to and fro, looking, as a child might have done, at the glitter of a ring he wore in the firelight. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mr. Wing did not seem very well pleased, sir,\" said Gibbs, after clearing his throat. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Of course he had to appear displeased, whether he was or not, Gibbs. A little hocus-pocus, a little official solemnity, is the thing to assume, I suppose. I think that man\u0027s nose is the very longest I ever saw. Remarkable nose, eh, Gibbs?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But, sir,\" continued Gibbs, declining to discuss the surveyor\u0027s nose, \"he said that from inquiries that had been made, it\u0027s pretty certain that the missing letters were—stolen—they must have been stolen—at Whitford.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Very intelligent on the part of the official, Mr. Wing! Only I think you and I had come to pretty nearly the same conclusion before.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He made strict inquiries about the people in the office here, and I had to give him what information I could, sir.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Of course, of course, Gibbs! I quite understand,\" said Algernon, putting his hand out to shake that of the clerk with so frank a cordiality that the latter felt the tears spring into his eyes as he took the cool white hand into his own. \"I have felt very much for you, Mr. Errington,\" said he. \"Your position is a trying one, indeed. I would do almost anything in my power to set your mind more at rest. But I\u0027m sorry to say that I have an unpleasant matter to speak of.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I wonder,\" thought Algernon, leaning back in his chair once more, \"whether my friend Obadiah conceives our conversation hitherto to have been of an agreeable and entertaining nature, that he now announces something unpleasant by way of a change!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You will understand,\" said Gibbs, \"that I am speaking to you in the very strictest confidence. I should be sorry for it to come out that I had meddled in the matter. Nor, sir, would it be well for you to have it known that I gave you any warning.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I wish the old bore would not be so confoundedly long-winded!\" thought Algernon, nodding meanwhile with an air of thoughtful attention. \\n\\n \\n\\n But Gibbs was prone to long-windedness and to the making of speeches. And he now availed himself of the opportunity of haranguing the postmaster (one of whose chief faults was a vivacious impatience of his clerk\u0027s eloquence) to the fullest extent. But the gist of what he had to say was this: Roger Heath, the man whose money-letter had been lost, now declared that his correspondent at Bristol, being interrogated in the hope that he might be able to furnish some clue to the identification of the missing notes, stated that he remembered one was endorsed in blue ink instead of black: and that he, Heath, had reason to know that one of the notes paid by young Mrs. Errington to Ravell, the mercer, had been endorsed in blue ink! \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Now, sir,\" proceeded Gibbs, \"I remember its being a good deal talked of in the town at the time, that young Mrs. Errington had money unknown to you, and Mrs. Ravell spoke of it to many.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Damn Mrs. Ravell! What does it all mean, Gibbs?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Algernon got up from his chair, and leant his elbows on the chimney-piece, and hid his face in his hands, but he so stood that he could watch the clerk\u0027s countenance between his fingers. That countenance expressed trouble and compassion. Gibbs got up too, and stood looking at Algernon and shaking his head ruefully. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I thought it well you should know what was being said, Mr. Errington,\" said he. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What can I do, Gibbs? How can I stop their cursed tongues?\" Algernon still spoke with his face hidden. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, sir, you cannot stop their tongues, but—you might possibly put a stop to what sets their tongues going. Of course, the matter may be all explained simply enough. There may be plenty of bank-notes endorsed in blue ink——\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Of course there may! Chattering idiots!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And as to that particular note, Mr. Ravell paid it away, as well as the others Mrs. Errington gave him, to the agent of a Manchester house he deals with, the next day after it came into his hands. I ascertained that from Ravell himself.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll have the note traced!\" exclaimed Algernon, looking up for the first time. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That would be a difficult matter, sir. It has gone far and wide before now.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I tell you I will have it traced! And I will have that malignant scoundrel, Heath, pulled up pretty sharply, if he dares to make any more insinuations that——it is not difficult to see what he is driving at!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Gibbs laid his hand on the young man\u0027s shoulder. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I feel for you, Mr. Errington,\" he said. \"If I did not, I shouldn\u0027t put myself in the disagreeable position of saying what I have said. I should have attended to my own business, and let matters take their course. I hope you believe that I had only a kind motive in speaking?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I do believe it—heartily!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Thank you, sir. Then I shall make bold to give you one word of advice. Don\u0027t stir in the matter, nor make any threats against any one, until you have ascertained from Mrs. Errington where she got the notes that she paid to Ravell.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Algernon had bent down his head again, and he now answered without looking up: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No doubt Mrs. Errington can account for them to me, but she is not bound to do so to any one else. Nor can I allow any one to hint that she is so bound. I should be a blackguard if I could listen to a word of that sort.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I hope it may come right, Mr. Errington. After all, there has been nothing, and, so far as I see, there can be nothing, but talk to hurt you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My good fellow,\" said Algernon, as he once more gave his hand to his clerk, \"it\u0027s a kind of talk which poisons a man\u0027s life. You know that as well as I do.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Then Gibbs took his leave of his superior, and went back into the outer office to watch over the epistolary correspondence of Whitford. As he sat at his desk there his mind was full of sympathy with Algernon Errington. \"Poor young man! He took it beautifully. It must be a terrible blow—an awful blow. But, no doubt, he has had his suspicions before now. What a warning against worldly-mindedness! He is a victim to that vain and godless woman; and that\u0027s all that comes of the marriage that so uplifted the heart of his mother. But he would be a beautiful character, if he had only got religion, and would leave off profane swearing. He is so guileless and outspoken, like a child, almost. Ah, poor young man! I hope the Lord may bless this trial to him. But—religion or no religion—I don\u0027t believe he\u0027ll ever be fit to be postmaster of Whitford.\" Thus ran the reflections of Mr. Obadiah Gibbs. \\n\\n \\n\\n When Algernon reached home that evening, he bade Lydia put up a few things for him into a little travelling valise; and when he met his wife at the dinner-table, he told her he should go up to London that night by the mail-coach. He explained, in answer to her surprised inquiries, lamentations, and objections, uttered in a querulous drawl, that he must get help from Lord Seely; that it was useless to write to him under the present circumstances, seeing that his wife would probably intercept the letter; and that, therefore, he had resolved to go to town himself and obtain a personal interview with Lord Seely. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But, Ancram!—what\u0027s the use? Why on earth should you fly off in this way? I\u0027m sure it won\u0027t do! Do you suppose for an instant that Aunt Belinda will let you get at him?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I must try for it. Things have got to that pass now, that——Do you know what happened to me just as I went out after lunch? Gladwish, the shoemaker, sent to threaten me with arrest! I shall be walked off to prison, I suppose, for a few wretched pairs of abominable shoes. The fellow has no more notion of fitting my foot than a farrier.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"To prison! Oh, Ancram! But Gladwish\u0027s bill cannot be so very large——\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Of course it\u0027s not \u0027so very large!\u0027\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then, if we paid it, or even part of it——\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Paid it! Upon my word, Cassy, you are too absurd! \u0027Paid it!\u0027 In the first place, I have only a very few pounds in the house—barely enough to take me to town, I think; and, in the next place, if I paid Gladwish, what would be the result? The butcher, the baker, and the candlestick-maker would be all down on me with summonses, and writs, and executions, and bedevilments of every imaginable kind. But you have no more notion—you take it all so coolly. \u0027Pay him!\u0027 By George! Cassy, it\u0027s very hard to stand such nonsense!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Castalia withdrew from the table, and sat down on the little sofa and cried. Her husband looked at her across a glass of very excellent sherry, which he was just about to hold up to the light. \"I think, Castalia,\" he said, \"I really do think, that when a man is in such trouble as I am, reduced to the brink of ruin, not knowing which way to turn for a ten-pound note, struggling, striving, bothering his brains to find a way out of the confounded mess, he might expect something more cheering and encouraging from his wife than perpetual snivelling.\" With that he cracked a filbert with a sharp jerk of indignation. But Algernon\u0027s forte was not the minatory or impressively wrathful style of eloquence. He could hurl a sarcasm, sharp, light, and polished; but when he came to wielding such a ponderous weapon as serious reproof on moral considerations, he was apt to make a poor hand of it. It was excessively disagreeable, too, to see that woman\u0027s thin shoulders moving convulsively under her gay-coloured dress, as she sobbed with her head buried in the sofa cushions. That really must be put a stop to. So, as it appeared evident that scolding would not quench the tears, he tried coaxing. The coaxing was not so efficacious as it would have been once. Still, Castalia responded to it to the extent of endeavouring to check the sobs which still shook her frail chest and throat. \"When shall you be back, Ancram?\" she said, looking beseechingly at him. He answered that he hoped to be in Whitford again on Tuesday night, or Wednesday at the latest (it was then Monday), and he particularly impressed on her the necessity of telling any one who might inquire the cause of his absence, that he had been suddenly called up to town by the illness of Lord Seely. He had, in fact, said a word or two to that effect when, on his way home, he had ordered the fly, which was to carry him and his valise to the coach-office. Castalia insisted on accompanying him to the coach, despite the damp cold of the night, a proceeding which he did not much combat, since he felt it would serve to give colour to his statement to the landlord of the \"Blue Bell.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Keep up your spirits, Cassy,\" he cried, waving his hand from the coach-window as he stood in the inn yard, muffled in shawls and furs. \"I hope I shall bring back good news of your uncle.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Then Castalia was trundled back to Ivy Lodge in the jingling old fly, whilst her husband rolled swiftly behind four fleet horses towards London. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2168/61310.html","bookId":444,"book":{"id":444,"title":"A Charming Fellow","description":"简介： The room was very quiet.
