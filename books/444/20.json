{"id":21622,"no":20,"title":"Volume II CHAPTER I.","content":"\\n\\n \"So you are to come to Switzerland with us next month, Ancram,\" said Miss Kilfinane. She was seated at the piano in Lady Seely\u0027s drawing-room, and Algernon was leaning on the instrument, and idly turning over a portfolio of music. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes; I hope your serene highness has no objection to that arrangement?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It would be of no use my objecting, I suppose!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Of none whatever. But it would be unpleasant.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, you would still go then, whether I liked it or not?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m afraid the temptation to travel about Europe in your company would be too strong for me!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How silly you are, Ancram!\" said Miss Kilfinane, looking up half shyly, half tenderly. But she met no answering look from Algernon. He had just come upon a song that he wanted to try, and was drawing it out from under a heap of others in the portfolio. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Look here, Castalia,\" he said, \"I wish you would play through this accompaniment for me. I can\u0027t manage it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n It will be seen that Algernon had become familiar enough with Miss Kilfinane to call her by her Christian-name. And, moreover, he addressed her in a little tone of authority, as being quite sure she would do what he asked her. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"This?\" she said, taking the song from his hand. \"Why do you want to sing this dull thing? I think Glück is so dreary! And, besides, it isn\u0027t your style at all.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Isn\u0027t it? What is my style, I wonder?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh light, lively things are your style.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n At the bottom of his mind, perhaps, Algernon thought so too. But it is often very unpleasant to hear our own secret convictions uttered by other people; and he did not like to be told that he could not sing anything more solid than a French chansonette. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Lady Harriet particularly wishes me to try this thing of Glück\u0027s at her house next Saturday,\" he said. \\n\\n \\n\\n Miss Kilfinane threw down the song pettishly. \"Oh, Lady Harriet,\" she exclaimed. \"I might have known it was her suggestion! She is so full of nonsense about her classical composers. I think she makes a fool of you, Ancram. I know it will be a failure if you attempt that song.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Thank you very much, Miss Kilfinane! And now, having spoken your mind on the subject, will you kindly play the accompaniment?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Algernon picked up the piece of music, smoothed it with his hand, placed it on the desk of the piano, and made a little mocking bow to Castalia. His serenity and good humour seemed to irritate her. \"I\u0027m sick of Lady Harriet!\" she said, querulously, and with a shrug of the shoulders. The action and the words were so plainly indicative of ill temper, that Lady Seely, who waddled into the drawing-room at that moment, asked loudly, \"What are you two quarrelling about, eh?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, what a shocking idea, my lady! We\u0027re not quarrelling at all,\" answered Algernon, raising his eyebrows, and smiling with closed lips. He rarely showed his teeth when he smiled, which circumstance gave his mouth an expression of finesse and delicate irony that was peculiar, and—coupled with the candidly-arched brows—attractive. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, it takes two to make a quarrel, certainly,\" returned my lady. \"But Castalia was scolding you, at all events. Weren\u0027t you now, Castalia?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Castalia deigned not to reply, but tossed her head, and began to run her fingers over the keys of the piano. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The fact is, Lady Seely,\" said Algernon, \"that Castalia is so convinced that I shall make a mess of this aria—which Lady Harriet Dormer has asked me to sing for her next Saturday—that she declines to play the accompaniment of it for me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, you ought to be immensely flattered, young jackanapes! She wouldn\u0027t care a straw about some people\u0027s failures, would you, Castalia? Would you mind, now, if Jack Price were to sing a song and make an awful mess of it, eh?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"As to that, it seems to me that Jack Price makes an awful mess of most things he does,\" replied Castalia. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ah, exactly! So one mess more or less don\u0027t matter. But in the case of our Admirable Crichton here, it is different.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I think he is getting awfully spoiled,\" said Castalia, a little less crossly. And there was absolutely a blush upon her sallow cheek. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And that\u0027s the reason you snub him, is it? You see, Ancram, it\u0027s all for your good, if Castalia is a little hard on you!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Miss Kilfinane rose and left the room, saying that she must dress for her drive. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I think Castalia is harder on Lady Harriet than on me,\" said Algernon, when Castalia was gone. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ah! H\u0027m! Castalia has lots of good points, but—I daresay you have noticed it—she is given to being a little bit jealous when she cares about people. Now you show a decided liking for Lady Harriet\u0027s society, and you crack up her grace, and her elegance, and her taste, and all that. And sometimes I think poor Cassy don\u0027t quite like it, don\u0027t you know?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What on earth can it matter to her?\" cried Algernon. He knew that Castalia was no favourite with my lady, and he flattered himself that he was becoming a favourite with her. So he spoke with a little half-contemptuous smile, and a shrug of impatience, when he asked, \"What on earth can it matter to her?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n But my lady did not smile. She threw her head back, and looked at Algernon from under her half-closed eyelids. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s my opinion, young man, that it matters a good deal to Castalia,\" she said; \"more than it would have mattered to me when I was a young lady, I can tell you. But there\u0027s no accounting for tastes.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Then Lady Seely also left the room, having first bidden Algernon to come and dine with her the next day. \\n\\n \\n\\n Algernon was dumfoundered. \\n\\n \\n\\n Not that he had not perceived the scornful Castalia\u0027s partiality for his charming self; not that her submission to his wishes, or even his whims, and her jealous anxiety to keep him by her side whenever there appeared to be danger of his leaving it for the company of a younger or more attractive woman, had escaped his observation. But Algernon was not fatuous enough to consider himself a lady-killer. His native good taste would alone have prevented him from having any such pretension. It was ridiculous; and it involved, almost of necessity, some affectation. And Algernon never was affected. He accepted Castalia\u0027s marked preference as the most natural thing in the world. He had been used to be petted and preferred all his life. But it truly had not entered into his head that the preference meant anything more than that Castalia found him amusing, and clever, and good-looking, and that she liked to keep so attractive a personage to herself as much as possible. For Algernon had noted the Honourable Castalia\u0027s little grudging jealousies, and he knew as well as anybody that she did not like to hear him praise Lady Harriet, for whom, indeed, she had long entertained a smouldering sort of dislike. But that she should have anything like a tender sentiment for himself, and, still more, that Lady Seely should see and approve it—for my lady\u0027s words and manner implied no less—was a very astonishing idea indeed. \\n\\n \\n\\n So astonishing was it, that after a while he came to the conclusion that the idea was erroneous. He turned Lady Seely\u0027s words in his mind, this way and that, and tried to look at them from all points of view, and—as words will do when too curiously scrutinised—they gradually seemed to take another and a different meaning, from the first obvious one which had struck him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The old woman was only giving me a hint not to annoy Miss Kilfinane; not to excite her peevish temper, or exasperate her envy.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n But this solution would not quite do, either. \"Lady Seely is not too fond of Castalia,\" he said to himself. \"Besides, I never knew her particularly anxious to spare anyone\u0027s feelings. What the deuce did she mean, I wonder?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Algernon continued to wonder at intervals all the rest of the afternoon. His mind was still busy with the same subject when he came upon Jack Price, seated in the reading-room of the club, to which he had introduced Algernon at the beginning of his London career, and of which Algernon had since become a member. It was now full summer time. The window was wide open, and the Honourable John Patrick was lounging in a chair near it, with a newspaper spread out on his knees, and his eyes fixed on a water-cart that was be-sprinkling the dusty street outside. He looked very idle, and a little melancholy, as he sat there by himself, and he welcomed Algernon with even more than his usual effusion, asking him what he was going to do with himself, and offering to walk part of the way towards his lodgings with him, when he was told that Algernon must betake himself homeward. The offer was a measure of Mr. Price\u0027s previous weariness of spirit; for, in general, he professed to dislike walking. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And how long is it since you saw our friend, Mrs. Machyn-Stubbs?\" asked Jack Price of Algernon, as they strolled along, arm-in-arm, on the shady side of the way. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh—I\u0027m afraid it\u0027s rather a long time,\" said Algernon, carelessly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ah, now that\u0027s bad, my dear boy. You shouldn\u0027t neglect people, you know. And our dear Mrs. Machyn-Stubbs is exceedingly pleasant.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"As to neglecting her—I don\u0027t know that I have neglected her—particularly. What more could I do than call and leave my card?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Call again. You wouldn\u0027t leave off going to Lady Seely\u0027s because you happened not to find her at home once in a way.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Lady Seely is my relation.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"H\u0027m! Well, would you cut Lady Harriet Dormer for the same reason?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Cut her? But, my dear Mr. Price, you mustn\u0027t suppose that I have cut Mrs. Machyn-Stubbs!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Come, now, my dear fellow, I\u0027m a great deal older than you are, and I\u0027ll take the liberty of giving you a bit of advice. Never offend people, who mean to be civil, merely because they don\u0027t happen to amuse you. What, the deuce, we can\u0027t live for amusement in this life!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The moralising might be good, but the moralist was, Algernon thought, badly fitted with his part. He was tempted to retort on his new mentor, but he did not retort. He merely said, quietly: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Has Mrs. Machyn-Stubbs been complaining of me, then?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, the truth is, she has—in an indirect kind of way; you know—what?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll go and see her this evening. To-day is Thursday, isn\u0027t it? She has one of her \u0027At home\u0027s\u0027 this evening.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Jack Price looked at the young man admiringly. \"You\u0027re an uncommonly sensible fellow!\" said he. \"I give you my honour I never knew a fellow of your years take advice so well. By Jove! I wish I had had your common sense when I was your age. It\u0027s too late for me to do any good now, you know, what? And, in fact,\" (with a solemn lowering of his musical Irish voice) \"I split myself on the very rock I\u0027m now warning you off. I never was polite. And if any one told me to go to the right, sure it was a thousand to one that I\u0027d instantly bolt to the left!\" And shaking his head with a sad, regretful gesture, Jack Price parted from Algernon at the corner of the street. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Machyn-Stubbs received the truant very graciously that evening. She knew that, during his absence from her parties, he had been admitted into society, to which even her fashionable self could not hope to penetrate. But, though this might be a reason for a little genteel sneering at him behind his back, it was none whatever, Mrs. Machyn-Stubbs considered, for giving him a cool reception when he did grace her house with his presence. She said to several of her guests, one after the other: \"We have young Ancram Errington here to-night. He\u0027s so glad to come to us, poor fellow, for my people\u0027s place is his second home, down in the West of England. And, then, the Seelys think it nice of us to take notice of him, don\u0027t you know? He is a relation of Lady Seely\u0027s, and is quite in that set—the Dormers, and all those people. Ah! you don\u0027t know them? They say he is to marry Castalia Kilfinane. But we haven\u0027t spoken about it yet out of our own little circle. Her father was Viscount Kauldkail, and married Lord Seely\u0027s youngest sister,\" and so on, and so on with a set smile, and no expression whatever on her smooth, fair face. \\n\\n \\n\\n To Algernon himself she showed herself politely inquisitive on the subject of his engagement to Castalia, and startled him considerably by saying, when she found herself close to him for a few minutes near a doorway: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And are we really to congratulate you, Mr. Errington?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If you please, madam,\" answered Algernon, with a bright, amused smile and an easy bow, \"but I should like to know—if it be not indiscreet—on what special subject? I am, indeed, to be congratulated on finding myself here. But, then, you are hardly likely to be the person to do it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n At that moment Algernon was wedged into a corner behind a fat old gentleman, who was vainly struggling to extricate himself from the crowd in front, by making a series of short plunges forward, the rebound of which sent him back on to Algernon\u0027s toes with some violence. It was very hot, and a young lady was singing out of tune in the adjoining room; her voice floating over the murmur of conversation occasionally, in a wailing long-drawn note. Altogether, it might have been suspected by some persons that Mr. Ancram Errington was laughing at his hostess, when he spoke of his position at that time as being one which called for congratulation. But Mrs. Machyn-Stubbs was the sort of woman who completely baffled irony by a serene incapability of perceiving it. And she would sooner suspect you of maligning her, hating her, or insulting her, than of laughing at her. To this immunity from all sense of the ridiculous she owed her chief social successes; for there are occasions when some obtuseness of the faculties is useful. Mrs. Machyn-Stubbs tapped Algernon\u0027s arm lightly with her fan, as she answered, \"Now Mr. Errington, that\u0027s all very well with the outside world, but you shouldn\u0027t make mysteries with us! I look upon you almost as a brother of Orlando\u0027s, I do indeed.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027re very kind, indeed, and I\u0027m immensely obliged to you; but, upon my word, I don\u0027t know what you mean by my making mysteries!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, well, if you choose to keep your own counsel, of course you can do so. I will say no more.\" Upon which Mrs. Machyn-Stubbs proceeded to say a great deal more, and ended by plainly giving Algernon to understand that the rumour of his engagement to Miss Castalia Kilfinane had been pretty widely circulated during the last four or five weeks. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, Mrs. Machyn-Stubbs,\" said Algernon, laughing, \"you surely never believe more than a hundredth part of what you hear? There\u0027s Mr. Price looking for me. I promised to walk home with him, it is such a lovely night. Thank you, no; not any tea! Are you ever at home about four o\u0027clock? I shall take my chance of finding you. Good night.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Algernon was greatly puzzled. How and whence had the report of his engagement to Castalia originated? He would have been less puzzled, if not less surprised, had he known that the report had come in the first place from Lady Seely herself, who had let fall little words and hints, well understanding how they would grow and spread. He had not committed himself in his answer to Mrs. Machyn-Stubbs. He had replied to her in such a manner as to leave the truth or falsehood of the report she had mentioned an open question. He felt the consciousness of this to be a satisfaction. Some persons might say, \"Well, but since the report was false, why not say so?\" But Algernon always, and, as it were, instinctively, took refuge in the vague. A clear statement to which he should appear to be bound would have irked him like a tight shoe; and naturally so, since he was conscious that he should flexibly conform himself to circumstances as they might arise, and not stick with stubborn stupidity to any predetermined course of conduct, which might prove to be inconvenient. \\n\\n \\n\\n After saying \"Good night\" to his hostess he elbowed his way out of the crowded rooms, and went downstairs side by side with Jack Price. The latter knew everybody present, or thought he did. And as, when he did happen to make a mistake and to greet enthusiastically some total stranger whom he had never seen in his life before, he never acknowledged it, but persisted in declaring that he remembered the individual in question perfectly, although \"the name, the name, my dear sir, or madam, has quite escaped my wretched memory!\" his progress towards Mrs. Machyn-Stubbs\u0027s hall door was considerably impeded by the nods, smiles, and shakes of the hand, which he scattered broadcast. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There\u0027s Deepville,\" said he to Algernon, as they passed a tall, dark, thin-faced man, with a stern jaw and a haughty carriage of the head. \"Don\u0027t you know Deepville? Ah, then you should! You should really. The most delightful, lovable, charming fellow! He\u0027d be enchanted to make your acquaintance, Errington, quite enchanted. I can answer for him. There\u0027s nothing in the world would give him greater pleasure, what?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Algernon was by this time pretty well accustomed to Jack Price\u0027s habit of answering for the ready ecstasies of all his acquaintances with regard to each other, and merely replied that he dared to say Sir Lancelot Deepville was a very agreeable person. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And how\u0027s the fair Castalia?\" asked Jack, when they were out in the street. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I believe she is quite well. I saw her this morning.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, I suppose you did,\" exclaimed Jack Price with a little smile, which Algernon thought was to be interpreted by Mrs. Machyn-Stubbs\u0027s recent revelations. But the next minute Jack added, very unexpectedly, \"I had some idea, at one time, that Deepville was making up to her. But it came to nothing. She\u0027s a nice creature, is Castalia Kilfinane; a very nice creature.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Algernon could not help smiling at this disinterested praise. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m afraid she does not always behave quite nicely to you, Mr. Price,\" he said. And he said it with a little air of apology and proprietorship which he would not have assumed yesterday. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, you\u0027re quite mistaken, my dear boy; she\u0027s as nice as possible with me. I like Castalia Kilfinane. There\u0027s a great deal of good about her, and she\u0027s well educated and clever in her way—not showy, you know, what?—but—oh, a nice creature! There\u0027s a sort of bitter twang about her, you know, that I like immensely.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, well,\" cried Algernon, laughing outright, \"if you have a liking for bitters, indeed——\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ah, but she doesn\u0027t mean it. It\u0027s just a little flavour—a little soup?on. Oh, upon my word, I think Miss Kilfinane a thoroughly nice creature. It was a pity about Deepville now, eh, what?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I wonder that you never thought of trying your fortune in that quarter yourself, Mr. Price!\" said Algernon, looking at him curiously, as they passed within the glare of a street-lamp. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Is it me? Ah, now, I thought everybody knew that I wasn\u0027t a marrying man. Besides, there never was the least probability that Miss Kilfinane would have had me—none in the world. Sure, she\u0027d never think of looking at a bald old bachelor like myself, what?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Algernon did not feel called on to pursue the subject. But he had a conviction that Jack Price would not, under any circumstances, have given Miss Kilfinane the chance of accepting him. \\n\\n \\n\\n The allusion, however, seemed to have touched some long-silent chord of feeling in Jack, and set it vibrating. As they sat at supper together, Jack reverted to the sage, mentor-like tone he had assumed that morning, giving Algernon much sound advice of a worldly nature, and holding up his own case as a warning to all young men who liked to \"bolt to the left when they were told to go to the right,\" and presenting himself in the unusual light of a gloomy and disappointed person; and when a couple of tumblers of hot punch smoked on the table, Jack grew tender and sentimental. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ah, my dear Errington,\" he said, \"I wish ye may never know what it is to be a lonely old bachelor!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Lonely? Why you\u0027re the most popular man in London, out-and-out!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Popular! And what good does that do me? If I were dead to-morrow, who\u0027d care, do you think? Although that doesn\u0027t seem to me to be such a hard case as people say. Sure, I don\u0027t want anyone to cry when I\u0027m dead; but I\u0027d like \u0027em to care for me a little while I\u0027m living. If I\u0027d been my own elder brother, now; or if I\u0027d taken advantage of my opportunities, and made a good fortune, as I might have done——But \u0027twas one scrape after another I put my foot into. I did and said whatever came uppermost. And you\u0027ll find, my dear boy, that it\u0027s the foolish things that mostly do come uppermost.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s lucky that, amongst other foolish things, an imprudent marriage never rose to the surface,\" said Algernon. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, but it did! Oh, devil a doubt about it!\" The combined influence of memory and hot punch brought out Jack\u0027s musical brogue with unusual emphasis. \"Only, there I couldn\u0027t carry out my foolish intentions. It wasn\u0027t the will that was wanting, my dear boy.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Providence looked after you on that occasion?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Providence or—or the other thing. Oh, I could tell you a love-story, only you\u0027d be laughing at me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Indeed, I would not laugh!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"On my honour, I don\u0027t know why you shouldn\u0027t! I often enough have laughed at myself. She was the sweetest, gentlest, most delicate little creature!—Snowdrop I used to call her. And as for goodness, she was steeped in it. You felt goodness in the air wherever she was, just as you smell perfume all about when the hawthorns blossom in May. Ah! now to think of me talking in that way, and my head as smooth as a billiard-ball!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And—and how was it? Did your people interfere to prevent the match?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My people! Faith, they\u0027d have screeched to be heard from here to there if I\u0027d made her the Honourable Mrs. Jack Price, and contaminated the blood of the Prices of Mullingar. Did ye ever hear that my great-grandfather was a whisky distiller? Bedad, he was then! And I believe he manufactured good liquor, rest his soul! But I shouldn\u0027t have cared for that, as ye may believe. But they got hold of her, and told her that I was a roving, unsteady sort of fellow; and that was true enough. And—and she married somebody else. The man she took wasn\u0027t as good-looking as I was in those days. However, there\u0027s no accounting for these things, you know. It\u0027s fate, what? destiny! And she told me, in the pretty silver voice of hers, like a robin on a bough, that I had better forget her, and marry a lady in my own station, and live happy ever after. \u0027Mary,\u0027 said I, \u0027if I don\u0027t marry you I\u0027ll marry no woman, gentle or simple.\u0027 She didn\u0027t believe me. And I don\u0027t know that I quite believed myself. But so it turned out, you see, what? And so I was saved from a mésalliance, and from having, maybe, to bring up a numerous family on nothing a year; and the blood of the Prices of Mullingar is in a fine state of preservation, and Mary never became the Honourable Mrs. Jack Price. Honourable—bedad it\u0027s the Honourable Jack Price she\u0027d have made of me if she\u0027d taken me; an honourabler Jack than I\u0027ve been without her, I\u0027m afraid! D\u0027ye know, Errington, I believe on my soul that, if I had married Mary, and gone off with her to Canada, and built a log-house, and looked after my pigs and my ploughs, I\u0027d have been a happy man. But there it is, a man never knows what is really best for him until it\u0027s too late. We\u0027ll hope there are compensations to come, what? Of all the dreary, cut-throat, blue-devilish syllables in the English language, I believe those words \u0027too late\u0027 are the ugliest. They make a fellow feel as if he was being strangled. So mind your p\u0027s and q\u0027s, my boy, and don\u0027t throw away your chances whilst you\u0027ve got \u0027em!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And thus ended Jack Price\u0027s sermon on worldly wisdom. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2168/61281.html","bookId":444,"book":{"id":444,"title":"A Charming Fellow","description":"简介： The room was very quiet.
