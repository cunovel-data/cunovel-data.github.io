{"id":21630,"no":28,"title":"CHAPTER IX.","content":"We have already been present at more than one social gathering at Dr. Bodkin\u0027s house. But these entertainments have been of an informal character, and the guests at them all persons in the habit of meeting each other very frequently. On Mr. and Mrs. Algernon Errington\u0027s arrival in Whitford, after their marriage, Dr. and Mrs. Bodkin issued cards for an evening party, and invited the leading personages of their acquaintance to meet the bride and bridegroom. \n \n Mrs. Errington was in high delight. She appreciated this attention from her old friends very highly. Castalia, it was true, looked discontented and disdainful about the whole affair; and demanded to know why she must be dragged out to these people\u0027s stupid parties before she had had time to turn round in her own house. But then, as Mrs. Errington reflected, Castalia did not understand Whitford society. \"The fact is, my dear,\" said her mother-in-law with suavity, \"it may be all a very trumpery business in your eyes, and after the circles you have moved in, but I assure you it is considered a very desirable thing here to have the entrée to Dr. Bodkin\u0027s. And then they scarcely ever entertain on a showy scale; nothing but a few friends, tea and cake, your rubber, and a tray afterwards. But, for this occasion, I hear there are great preparations going on. They won\u0027t dance, because Minnie can\u0027t stand the vibration. But there will be quite a large gathering. Of course, my dear, it is not what I was accustomed to at Ancram Park. But they are most kind, well-meaning people. And Minnie is highly accomplished; even learned, I believe.\" \n \n \"I hate blue-stockings,\" returned Mrs. Algernon with a shrug. \n \n \"Oh! but Minnie is not the least blue in her manners! Indeed, her knowing Greek has ever been a mystery to me; for I assure you she is extremely handsome, and has, I think, the finest pair of eyes I ever saw in my life. But I suppose it is accounted for by her affliction, poor thing!\" \n \n Castalia had darted a quick, suspicious glance at her husband on hearing of Minnie\u0027s beauty, but relapsed into languid indifference when she was told that Miss Bodkin was a confirmed invalid, suffering from disease of the spine. \n \n In other circles Mrs. Errington was by no means so cool and condescending in speaking of the doctor\u0027s projected party. The check administered to her exultation by Castalia\u0027s chilly indifference only caused a fuller ebullition of it in other directions. She overwhelmed her new landlady by the magnitude and magnificence of her \"Ancramisms\"—I have already asked permission to use the phrase in these pages—and was looked up to by that simple soul as a very exalted personage; for the new landlady was no other than the widow Thimbleby. \n \n Mrs. Errington occupied the two rooms on the first-floor above Mr. Diamond\u0027s parlours. The place was smaller and poorer altogether than Maxfield\u0027s house, although it did not yield to it in cleanliness. Here was Mrs. Errington\u0027s old blue china set forth on a side-table in the little oblong drawing-room; and her work-box with its amber satin and silver implements; and the faded miniatures hung over the mantelpiece. Also there was a square of substantial, if somewhat faded, carpet in the middle of Mrs. Thimbleby\u0027s threadbare drugget, a mahogany table, and a roomy, comfortable easy-chair, all of which we have seen before. \n \n In a word, Mrs. Errington had taken advantage of old Max\u0027s somewhat rash offer, and had carried away with her such articles of furniture out of her old quarters as she fancied might be useful. \n \n Mrs. Errington took some credit to herself for her magnanimity in so doing. \"I could not refuse the poor man,\" she said to Mrs. Thimbleby. \"I have lived many years in his house, and although he was led away by mistaken ambition to want his drawing-room for his own use, and certainly did cause me great inconvenience at a moment when I was up to my eyes in important business, yet I could not refuse to accept his little peace-offering. A lady does not quarrel with that sort of person, you know. And, poor old man, I believe he was dreadfully cut up at my going away when it came to the point, and would have given anything to keep me. But I said, \u0027No, Mr. Maxfield, that is impossible. I have made other arrangements; and, in short, I cannot be troubled any more about this matter. But to show that I bear no malice, and that I shall not withdraw my countenance from your daughter, I am willing to accept the trifles you press upon me.\u0027 He was a good deal touched by my taking the things; poor, foolish, misguided old man!\" \n \n \"Well, it was real Christian of you, ma\u0027am,\" said simple Mrs. Thimbleby. \n \n The day of the party at Dr. Bodkin\u0027s arrived; and there was as intense an excitement connected with its advent as if it were to bring a county ball, or even a royal drawing-room. Whether a satin train, lappets and feathers, be intrinsically more important and worthy objects of anxiety than a white muslin frock and artificial roses, I do not presume to decide. Only I can unhesitatingly assert that the Misses Rose and Violet McDougall could not have given their female attendant more trouble about the preparation and putting on of the latter adornments—which formed their simple and elegant attire on this occasion—if they had been duchesses, and their gowns cloth of gold. \n \n Miss Chubb, too, contemplated her new dress of a light blue colour, laid out upon her bed, with great interest and satisfaction. And when her toilet for the evening was completed, she had more little gummed rings of hair on her cheeks and forehead than had ever before been beheld there at one time. \n \n The company began to assemble in Dr. Bodkin\u0027s drawing-rooms about half-past eight o\u0027clock. There were all our old acquaintances—Mr. Smith, the surgeon, and his wife; Mr. and Mrs. Dockett, with Miss Alethea, now promoted to long dresses and \"grown-up\" young-ladyhood. There was Orlando Pawkins; Mr. Warlock, the curate; and Colonel Whistler, with his charming nieces. Miss Chubb had dined with the Bodkins in the middle of the day, and, after being of great assistance to the mistress of the house in the preparation of her supper-table, had returned to her own home to dress, and consequently arrived upon the festive scene rather later than would otherwise have been the case. But she was not the last guest to arrive. Mr. Diamond came in after her; and so did one or two families from the neighbourhood of Whitford. (\"County people,\" Miss Chubb said in a loud whisper to Rose McDougall, who replied snappishly, \"Of course! We know them very well. Have visited them for years.\") \n \n \"This is a brilliant scene,\" said good-natured Miss Chubb, turning to Mr. Warlock, whom Fate had thrown into her neighbourhood. Mr. Warlock agreed with her that it was very brilliant; and, indeed, Dr. Bodkin\u0027s drawing-rooms, well lighted with wax candles, and with abundance of hot-house flowers tastefully arranged, and relieved against the rich crimson and oak furniture, were exceedingly cheerful, pleasant, and picturesque. There was an air of comfort and good taste about the rooms—a habitable, home-like air—not always to be found in more splendid dwellings. \n \n On her crimson lounging-chair reclined Minnie Bodkin. Her dress was of heavy cream-white silk, with gold ornaments. She wore nothing in her abundant dark hair, and her pale face seemed to many who looked upon it that evening to be more lovely than ever. Her lips had a tinge of red in them, and her eyes were full of lustre. There was a suppressed excitement about her looks and manner, which lighted up her perfectly-moulded features with a strange beauty that struck all observers. Even the McDougalls could not but admit that Minnie looked very striking, but added that she was a little too theatrically got up, didn\u0027t you think so? That was poor Minnie\u0027s failing. All for effect! \"And,\" added Rose, \"she has a good foil in that little pink and white creature who sits in the corner beside her chair, and never moves. I suppose she is told to do it. But the idea of dressing that chit up in a violet silk gown fit for a married woman! And she has no figure to carry it off. I really think it rather a strong measure on the Bodkins\u0027 part to ask us all to meet a girl of such very low origin on equal terms. But there it is, you see! Poor dear Minnie delights in doing startling things, unlike other people. And, of course, her parents refuse her nothing.\" \n \n Miss Rose\u0027s opinion of Rhoda Maxfield\u0027s insignificant appearance was not, however, shared by many persons present. Several young gentlemen, and more than one old gentleman, vied with each other in offering her cups of tea, and paying her various little attentions according to their opportunities. Even old Colonel Whistler, when he thought himself unobserved by his nieces, sidled up to pretty Rhoda Maxfield, and was heard to say to one of the \"county\" gentlemen, \"She\u0027s the prettiest girl I\u0027ve seen this many a day, by George! And I know a pretty girl when I see one, sir; or used to, once upon a time!\" \n \n To Rhoda, all the strangers who spoke and looked so kindly were merely troublesome. Her colour went and came, her heart beat with anxiety. She started nervously every time the door opened. She could think only of Algernon and Algernon\u0027s wife. She made a silent and very earnest prayer that she might be strengthened to sit still and quiet when they should appear, for she had had serious apprehensions lest she should be irresistibly impelled to start up and run away, as soon as she saw them. \n \n It was in vain that young Mr. Pawkins hovered near her, inviting her to accept his arm into the tea-room; it was in vain that old Colonel Whistler softened his martinet voice to ask her, with paternal tenderness, how she had enjoyed her stay at the seaside, and to say that, if one might judge by her looks, she had derived great benefit from the change of air. In the words of the song, \"All men else seemed to her like shadows.\" She was in a dream, with the consciousness of an impending awakening, which she half longed for, half dreaded. \n \n Two persons watched over her, and covered the mistakes she made in her nervous trepidation. Matthew Diamond and Minnie Bodkin exerted themselves to shield her from importunate observation, and to give her time to recover her self-possession, if that might be possible. Diamond was in good spirits. He could wait, he could be patient, he could be silent now, with a good heart. Algernon\u0027s marriage had opened a bright vista of hope before him; and perhaps he had never felt so disposed to condone and excuse his old pupil\u0027s faults and failings as at the present moment. \"Minnie is a good creature,\" he thought, with a momentary, grateful diversion of his attention from Rhoda, \"to keep my timid birdie so carefully under her wing! She might do it with a little more softness of manner. But we cannot change people\u0027s natures.\" \n \n Meanwhile Minnie reclined in her chair, watching his tender lingering looks at Rhoda, and his complete indifference to everyone else, with a heartache which might have excused even less \"softness of manner\" than Diamond thought she displayed towards the girl beside her. \n \n At length a little commotion, and movement among the persons standing near the door, announced a new arrival. Rhoda felt sick, and grasped the back of Minnie\u0027s chair so hard that her little glove was split by the force of the pressure. But that horrible sensation passed away in a few seconds. And then, looking up with renewed powers of seeing and hearing, she perceived that Mrs. Errington had made her entrance alone, and was holding forth in her mellow voice to Dr. and Mrs. Bodkin, and a knot of other persons in the centre of the room. \n \n Mrs. Errington was radiant. She nodded and smiled to one and another with an almost royal suavity and condescension. She was attired in a rich dove-coloured silk gown (Lord Seely\u0027s gift to her at her son\u0027s wedding), and wore rose-coloured ribbons in her lace cap, and looked altogether as handsome and happy a matron of her years as you would easily find in a long summer\u0027s day. \n \n \"I have sent back the carriage for them, dear Mrs. Bodkin,\" she was saying, when Rhoda gained self-possession enough to take account of her words. \"Naughty Castalia was not ready. So I said, \u0027My dear children, I shall go on without you, and put in an appearance for one member of the family at least!\u0027 So here I am. And my boy and girl will be here directly. And how is dear Minnie?—How d\u0027ye do, Colonel?—Good evening, Miss Chubb.—Ah, Alethea! Papa and mamma quite well?—Oh, there she is! How are you, my dear Minnie? But I need not ask, for I never saw you looking so well?\" \n \n By this time Mrs. Errington had arrived at Minnie\u0027s chair, and stooped to kiss her. Almost at the same moment she caught sight of Rhoda, who shrank back a little, flushed and trembling. Mrs. Errington thought she very well understood the cause of this, and thought to herself, \"Poor child, she is ashamed of her father\u0027s behaviour!\" \n \n \"What, my pretty Rhoda!\" she said aloud. And, drawing the girl to her, kissed her warmly. \"I\u0027m very glad to see you again, child,\" continued Mrs. Errington; \"I began to fancy we were not to meet any more. You must come and see me, and spend a long day. I suppose that won\u0027t be against the laws of the Medes and Persians, eh?\" \n \n The familiar voice, the familiar looks, the kind manner of her old friend, helped to put Rhoda at her ease. The fact, too, that Mrs. Errington had no suspicion of her feelings was calming. Mrs. Errington was not apt to suspect people of any feeling but gratification, when she was talking to them. \n \n In the full glow of her satisfaction Mrs. Errington even condescended to be gracious to Matthew Diamond, who came forward to offer his congratulations. \"Why, yes, Mr. Diamond,\" said the good lady, \"it is indeed a marriage after my own heart. And I do not think I am blinded by the partiality of a mother, when I say the bride\u0027s family are quite as gratified at the alliance as I am. Do you know that one of Mrs. Algernon\u0027s relatives is the Duke of Mackelpie and Brose? A distant relative, it is true. But these Scotch clans, you know, call cousins to the twentieth degree! His Grace sent Castalia a beautiful wedding present: a cairn-gorm, set in solid silver. So characteristic, you know! and so distinguished! No vulgar finery. Oh, the Broses and the Kauldkails have been connected from time immemorial.\" \n \n Then Colonel Whistler came up, and joined the circle round Mrs. Errington\u0027s chair; and Miss Chubb, whose curiosity generally got the better of her dignity when it came to a struggle between the two. To them sauntered up Alethea Dockett on the arm of Mr. Pawkins. The latter, finding it impossible to draw Rhoda into conversation, had philosophically transferred his attentions to the smiling, black-eyed Miss Alethea, much to the disgust and scorn of the McDougalls. \n \n Mrs. Errington soon had a numerous audience around her chair, and she improved the occasion by indulging in such flourishes as fairly staggered her hearers. Her account of the bride\u0027s trousseau was almost oriental in the splendour and boldness of its imagery. And Matthew Diamond began to believe that, with very small encouragement, she might be led on to endow her daughter-in-law with the roc\u0027s egg, which even Aladdin could not compass the possession of, when a diversion took place. \n \n Algernon Errington appeared close behind Miss Chubb, and said, almost in her ear, and in his old jaunty way, \"Well, is this the way you cut an old friend? Oh, Miss Chubb, I couldn\u0027t have believed it of you!\" \n \n The little spinster turned round quite fluttered, with both her fat little hands extended. \"Algy!\" she cried. \"But I beg pardon; I ought not to call you by that familiar name now, I suppose!\" \n \n \"By what name, then? I hope you don\u0027t mean to cut me in earnest!\" \n \n Then there was a general hand-shaking and exchange of greetings among the group. Rhoda was still in her old place behind Minnie\u0027s chair, and was invisible at first to one coming to the circle from the other end of the room, as Algernon had done. But in a minute he saw her, and for once his self-possession temporarily forsook him. \n \n If he had walked into the sitting-room at old Max\u0027s, and seen Rhoda there, in her accustomed place by his mother\u0027s knee, with the accustomed needlework in her hand, and dressed in the accustomed grey stuff frock, he might have accosted her with tolerable coolness and aplomb. The old associations, which might have unnerved some soft-hearted persons, would have strengthened Algernon by vividly recalling his own habitual ascendancy and superiority over his former love. But instead of the Rhoda he had been used to see, here was a lovely young lady, elegantly, even richly, dressed, received among the chief personages of her little world evidently on equal terms, and looking as gracefully in her right place there as the best of them. \n \n Algernon stood for a second, staring point-blank at her, unable to move or to speak. His embarrassment gave her courage. Not less to her own surprise than to that of the two who were watching her so keenly, she rose from her chair, and held out her hand with the little torn glove on it, saying in a soft voice, that was scarcely at all unsteady, \"How do you do, Mr. Errington?\" \n \n Algernon shook her proffered hand, and murmured something about having scarcely recognised her. Then someone else began to speak to him, and he turned away, as Rhoda resumed her seat, trembling from head to foot. \n \n So the dreaded meeting was over! Let her see him again as often as she might, no second interview could be looked forward to with the same anxious apprehension as the first. She had seen Algernon once more! She had spoken to him, and touched his hand! \n \n It seemed very strange that no outward thing should have changed, when such a moving drama had been going on within her heart! But not one of the faces around her showed any consciousness that they had witnessed a scene from the old, old story; that the clasp of those two young hands had meant at once, \"Hail!\" and \"Farewell!\"—farewell to the sweet, foolish dream, to the innocent tenderness of youth and maiden, to the soft thrilling sense of love\u0027s presence, that was wont to fill so many hours of life with a diffused sweetness, like the perfume of hidden flowers! \n \n No; the world seemed to go on much as usual. The McDougalls came flouncing up close beside her, to tell Minnie that they had just been introduced to \"the Honourable Mrs. Errington;\" and a very young gentleman (one of Dr. Bodkin\u0027s senior scholars) asked Rhoda if she had had any tea yet, and begged to recommend the pound-cake, from his own personal experience. \n \n \"Go with Mr. Ingleby,\" said Minnie, authoritatively. \"I put Miss Maxfield under your charge, Ingleby, and shall hold you responsible for her being properly attended to in the tea-room.\" \n \n The lad, colouring with pleasure, led off the unresisting Rhoda. All her force of will, all her courage, seemed to have been expended in the effort of greeting Algernon. She simply obeyed Miss Bodkin with listless docility. But, on reaching the tea-room, she was conscious that her friend had done wisely and kindly in sending her away, for there were but two persons there. One was Mr. Dockett, who was as inveterate a tea-drinker as Doctor Johnson; and the other was the Reverend Peter Warlock, hovering hungrily near the cake-basket. Neither of these gentlemen took any special notice of her, and she was able to sit quiet and unobserved. Her cavalier conscientiously endeavoured to fulfil Miss Minnie\u0027s injunctions, but was greatly disappointed by the indifference which Rhoda manifested to the pound-cake. However, he endeavoured to make up for her shortcomings by devouring such a quantity of that confection himself as startled even Dr. Bodkin\u0027s old footman, accustomed to the appetites of many a generation of school-boys. \n \n But all this time where was the bride? The party was given especially in her honour, and to omit her from any description of it would be an unpardonable solecism. \n \n The Honourable Mrs. Algernon Ancram Errington sat on a sofa in the principal drawing-room, with a discontented expression of countenance, superciliously surveying the company through her eye-glass, and asking where Algernon was, if he were absent from her side for five minutes. Castalia was looking in better health than when we first had the honour of making her acquaintance. She had grown a trifle stouter—or less lean. Her sojourn in Westmoreland had been more favourable to her looks than the fatigues of a London season, which, under other circumstances, she would have been undergoing. Happiness is said to be a great beautifier. And it was to be supposed that Castalia, having married the man of her heart, was happy. But yet the fretful creases had not vanished from her face; and there was even a more suspicious watchfulness in her bright, deeply-set eyes than formerly. \n \n Perhaps it may be well to record a few of the various verdicts passed on the bride\u0027s manners and appearance by our Whitford friends after that first evening. Possibly an impartial judgment may be formed from them; but it will be seen that opinions were strongly conflicting. \n \n Said Dr. Bodkin to his wife, \"What can the boy have been thinking of to marry that woman? A sickly, faded, fretful-looking person, nearly ten years his senior! I can forgive a generous mistake, but not a mean one. If he had run away with Ally Dockett from her boarding-school, it would, no doubt, have been a misfortune, but—I don\u0027t know that one would have loved him much the less!\" \n \n \"Oh, doctor!\" \n \n \"I am not counselling young gentlemen to run away with young ladies from boarding-schools, my dear. But—I\u0027m afraid this has been a marriage wholly of interest and ambition on his side. Ah! I hoped better things of Errington.\" And the doctor went on shaking his head for full a minute. \n \n Said Mrs. Smith to Mrs. Dockett, \"What do you think of the bride?\" Said Mrs. Dockett to Mrs. Smith, \"A stuck-up, unpleasant little thing! And I do wish somebody would tell her to keep her gown on her shoulders. I assure you, if I were to see my Ally half undressed in that fashion, I should box her ears. And Ally has a very pretty pair of shoulders, though I say it. She is not a bag of bones, like Mrs. Algernon, at all events.\" \n \n Said Miss Chubb to her old woman servant, \"Well, the Honourable Mrs. Algernon Errington is very distangy looking, Martha. That\u0027s a French word that means—means out of the common, aristocratic, you know. Very distangy, certainly! But she lacks sentiment, in my opinion. And her outline is very sharp, Martha. I prefer a rounder contour, both of face and figure. Some of the ladies found fault with her because of her low dress. But that—as I happen to know—is quite the custom with our upper classes in town. Mrs. Figgins\u0027s—wife of the Bishop of Plumbunn, you know, Martha—Mrs. Figgins\u0027s sister, who married Sir William Wick, of the Honourable Company of Tallow Chandlers, I believe—that\u0027s a kind of City society for dining sumptuously, Martha; you mustn\u0027t suppose it has anything to do with selling tallow candles! Well, Lady Wick sat down to dinner in low, every day of her life!\" \n \n Mr. Diamond and young Pawkins walked a little way together from the doctor\u0027s house to the \"Blue Bell\" inn. The master of Pudcombe Hall, on attempting to resume his acquaintance with the bride, had been received with scant courtesy. But this was not so much because Castalia intended to be specially uncivil to him, as because at that moment it happened, unfortunately, that she saw her husband in a distant part of the room talking to Minnie Bodkin with an air of animation. \n \n \"By Jove!\" cried the ingenuous Pawkins, \"I don\u0027t envy Errington. His wife looks so uncommon ill-tempered, and turns up her honourable nose at everybody.\" \n \n \"She does not turn up her nose at him,\" returned Diamond. \"And Errington will not be over sensitive on behalf of his friends.\" \n \n \"Oh, well! But she\u0027s so crabbed, somehow. One expects a bride to have some kind of softness in her manners, and—hang it all, there\u0027s not a particle of romance about her.\" \n \n \"My dear fellow, if there is in the United Kingdom a young man of three-and-twenty who can comfortably dispense with romance in his wife, our friend Errington is that young man.\" \n \n \"Oh, well! I know Errington\u0027s a very clever fellow, and all that, and perhaps I\u0027m a fool. But I—I shouldn\u0027t like my wife to be quite so cool and cutting in her manners, that\u0027s all!\" \n \n \"Neither should I. And perhaps I\u0027m a fool!\" \n \n \"Shouldn\u0027t you, now?\" Orlando was encouraged by this admission on Diamond\u0027s part, further, to express his opinion that it was all very fine to stick \"Honourable\" before your name; but that, for his part, he considered little Miss Maxfield to look fifty times more like a lady than Mrs. Algernon. And as for good looks, there was, of course, no comparison. And though Miss Maxfield was too shy and quiet, yet if you offered her any little civility, she thanked you in such a sweet way that a fellow felt as if he could do anything for her; whereas, some women stare at a fellow enough to turn a fellow into stone. \n \n But the Misses McDougall were enthusiastic in their praises of Algernon\u0027s wife. They performed a sort of Carmen Am?b?um after this fashion: \n \n Rose. \"That sweet creature, the Honourable Mrs. Algernon! I can\u0027t get her out of my head.\" \n \n Violet. \"Dear thing! What high-bred manners! And did she tell you that we are positively related? The Mackelpies, you know, call cousins with us. There was the branch that went off from the elder line of Brose\"—\u0026c. \u0026c. \u0026c. \n \n Rose. \"Oh yes; one feels at home directly with people of one\u0027s own class. How lucky Algernon has been to get such a wife, instead of some chit of a girl who would have had no weight in society!\" \n \n Violet. \"Yes; but she\u0027s quite young enough, Rose?\" \n \n Rose. \"Oh, dear me, of course! But I meant that Algernon has shown his sense in not selecting a bread-and-butter Miss. I own I detest school-girls.\" \n \n Violet. \"She asked us to go and see her. Do you know I think we were the only girls in the room she seemed to take to at all! Even Minnie Bodkin, now—she was very cool, I thought, to Minnie.\" \n \n Rose. \"My dear child, how often have I told you that the people here have quite a mistaken estimate of Minnie Bodkin? They have just spoiled her. Her airs are really ludicrous. But directly a person of superior birth comes to the place you see how it is! Perhaps you\u0027ll believe me another time. I do think you were half inclined to fall down and worship Minnie yourself!\" \n \n Violet. \"Oh no; not that! But she is very clever, you know. And, in spite of her affliction, I thought she looked wonderfully handsome to-night.\" \n \n Rose. (Sharply.) \"Pshaw! She was dressed up like an actress. I saw the look Mrs. Algernon gave her. How beautifully Mrs. Algernon had her hair done!\" \n \n Violet. \"And did you notice that little flounce at the bottom of her dress?\"——\u0026c. \u0026c. \n \n Both. (Almost together.) \"Isn\u0027t she charming, uncle?\" \n \n \"Very,\" answered Colonel Whistler, twirling his moustaches. Then the gallant gentleman, as he took his bed-candle, was heard to mutter something which sounded like \"d——d skinny!\" \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2168/61289.html","bookId":444,"book":{"id":444,"title":"A Charming Fellow","description":"简介： The room was very quiet.
