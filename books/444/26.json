{"id":21628,"no":26,"title":"CHAPTER VII.","content":"In the first week of August Mrs. Errington returned to Whitford. She had got over her annoyance at not having been intrusted sooner with the news of Algernon\u0027s engagement to Miss Kilfinane. By dint of telling her friends so, she had at last persuaded herself that she had been in the secret all along; and, if she felt any other mortifications and disappointments connected with her son\u0027s marriage, she kept them to herself. But it is probable that she did not keenly feel any such. She was not sensitive; and she did believe that, by connecting himself so nearly with Lord Seely\u0027s family, Algernon was advancing his prospects of success in the world. These sources of comfort, combined with an excellent digestion, and the perennial gratification of contemplating her own claims to distinction as contrasted with those of her neighbours, kept the worthy lady in good spirits, and she returned to Whitford in a kind of full blow of cheerfulness and importance. \\n\\n \\n\\n Her reception there, at the outset, was, however, far from being what she had looked forward to. She had written to Rhoda announcing the day and hour of her arrival, and requesting that James Maxfield should meet her at the \"Blue Bell\" inn, where the coach stopped, with a fly for the conveyance of herself and her luggage to her old quarters. Mrs. Errington had not previously written to Rhoda from Westmoreland, but she had forwarded to her at different times two copies of the Applethwaite Advertiser. In one of these journals a preliminary announcement of Algernon\u0027s marriage had appeared under the heading of \"Alliance in High Life.\" In the second there was an account of the wedding, and the breakfast, and the rejoicings in the village of Long Fells, which did much credit to the imaginative powers of the writer. According to the Applethwaite Advertiser, the ceremony had been imposing, the breakfast sumptuous, and the village demonstrations enthusiastic. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Errington had bought twenty copies of the newspaper for distribution among her friends; and she pleased herself with thinking how grateful the Maxfields would be to her for sending them the papers with the interesting paragraphs marked in red ink. She also looked forward with much complacency to having Rhoda for a listener to all her narrations about the wedding and life at Long Fells, and the great people whom she had met there. Rhoda was such a capital listener! And then, besides and beyond all that, Mrs. Errington was fond of Rhoda, and had more motherly warmth of feeling for her than she had as yet attained to for her new daughter-in-law. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Errington\u0027s head was stretched out of the coach-window as the vehicle clattered up the archway of the \"Blue Bell\" inn. It was about seven o\u0027clock on a fine August evening, and there was ample light enough for the traveller to distinguish all the familiar features of the streets through which she passed. \"James will be standing in the inn-yard ready to receive me,\" she thought; \"and I suppose the fly will be waiting at the corner by the booking-office. I wonder whether the driver will be the lame old man or young Simmons?\" She was still debating this question when the coach turned sharply round under the archway, and stopped in the great rambling yard of the old-fashioned \"Blue Bell\" inn. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Errington got down unassisted; James Maxfield was not there. She looked round in bewilderment, standing hot, dusty, and tired in the yard, where, after a bustling waiter had tripped up to her to ask if she wanted a room, and tripped away again, no one took any heed of her. \\n\\n \\n\\n A fly was not to be had in Whitford at a moment\u0027s notice. After waiting for some ten minutes, Mrs. Errington found there was nothing for it but to walk to her lodgings. She left her luggage in the coach-office to be called for, and set out carrying a rather heavy hand-bag, and hurrying through the streets at a pace much quicker than her usual dignified rate of moving. She wished not to be seen and recognised by any passing acquaintance under circumstances so unfavourable to an impressive or triumphant demeanour. \\n\\n \\n\\n Arrived at Jonathan Maxfield\u0027s house, the aspect of things was not much improved. Betty Grimshaw opened the door, and stared in surprise on seeing Mrs. Errington. She had not been expected. Mr. Maxfield was over at Duckwell at his son\u0027s farm. James was busy in the store-house. And as for Rhoda, she was away on a visit to Miss Bodkin at the seaside, and had been for some weeks. A letter? Oh, if a letter had come for Rhoda, her father would have sent it on to her. It was a two days\u0027 post from where she was to Whitford. And the newspapers? Betty did not know. She had not seen them. Her brother-in-law had had them, she supposed. Yes; she had heard that Mr. Algernon was married, or going to be married. The servants from Pudcombe Hall had spoken of it when they came into the shop. Jonathan had not said anything on the subject as far as she knew. Mrs. Errington knew what Jonathan was. He never was given to much conversation. And it was Betty\u0027s opinion, delivered very frankly, that Jonathan grew crustier and closer as he got older. But wouldn\u0027t Mrs. Errington like a cup of tea? Betty would have the kettle boiling in a few minutes. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Errington felt rather forlorn, as she entered her old sitting-room and looked around her. It was trim and neat, indeed, and spotlessly clean; but it had the chill, repellent look of an uninhabited apartment. The corner cupboard was locked, and its treasure of old china hidden from view. Algernon\u0027s books were gone from the shelf above the piano. A white cloth was spread over the sofa, and the hearth-rug was turned upside down, displaying a grey lining, instead of the gay-coloured scraps of cloth. \\n\\n \\n\\n She missed Rhoda. She had become accustomed to Algernon\u0027s absence from the familiar room; but Rhoda\u0027s absence made a blank in it, that was depressing. And perhaps Mrs. Errington herself was surprised to find how dreary the place looked, without the girl\u0027s gentle face and modest figure. She gladly accepted Betty Grimshaw\u0027s invitation to take her tea downstairs in the comfortable, bright kitchen, instead of alone in the melancholy gentility of her own sitting-room. Betty was as wooden-faced, and grim, and rigid in her aspect as ever. But she was not unfriendly towards her old lodger. And, moreover, she was entirely respectful in her manner, holding it as a fixed article of her faith that \"gentlefolks born\" were intended by Providence to be treated with deference, and desiring to show that she herself had been trained to becoming behaviour under the roof of a person of quality. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was little more than nine o\u0027clock when Mrs. Errington rose to go to bed, being tired with her journey. As she did so, she said, \"Mrs. Grimshaw, will you get James to send a hand-cart for my luggage in good time to-morrow?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, your luggage?\" returned Betty. \"Well, do you think it is worth while to send for it, if you\u0027re not going to stay?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Errington was so much astonished by this speech, that she sat down again on the chair she had just quitted. Then, after a minute\u0027s pause, her mind, which did not move very rapidly, arrived at what she supposed to be the explanation of Betty\u0027s words. \"Oh, I see,\" she said; \"you took it for granted that, on my son\u0027s marriage, I should leave you and join him. But it is not so, my good soul. My daughter-in-law has implored me to live with them, but I have refused. It is better for the young people to be by themselves; and I prefer my own independence also. No, my good Mrs. Grimshaw, I shall remain in my old quarters until Mr. Algernon leaves Whitford for good. And perhaps, even then, I may not give you up altogether, who knows?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Betty hesitated for an instant before replying. \"Then Jonathan has not said anything to you about giving up the rooms?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Good gracious, no! I have not heard from Mr. Maxfield at all!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I suppose he didn\u0027t expect you back quite so soon. Andâ€”there, I\u0027m sure I won\u0027t take upon myself to speak for him. I shouldn\u0027t have got on with my brother-in-law all these years if I hadn\u0027t made it a rule to try for peace and quietness, and never interfere.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n But Mrs. Errington persisting in her demand that Betty should explain herself more fully, the latter at length confessed that, during the past two or three weeks, Jonathan Maxfield had declared his intention of getting rid of his lodger, and of not letting the first floor of his house again. \"Your sitting-room is to be kept as a kind of a drawing-room for Rhoda, as I understand Jonathan,\" said she. \\n\\n \\n\\n A drawing-room for Rhoda! Mrs. Errington could not believe her senses. \"Why, what is Mr. Maxfield thinking of?\" she exclaimed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, you don\u0027t know what a fuss Jonathan has been making lately about Rhoda! Before you went away, you know, ma\u0027am, as he had begun to spend a deal of money on her clothes. And since then, more and more; it\u0027s been all his talk as Rhoda was to be a lady. The notion has got stuck fast in his head, and wild horses wouldn\u0027t drag it out.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Errington rose very majestically. \"I much fear,\" she said, \"I much fear that I am responsible for this delusion of your brother-in-law. I have a little spoiled the girl, and taken too much notice of her. I regret it now. But, really, Rhoda is such a sweet creature that I don\u0027t know that I have been so very much to blame, either. It is true I have introduced her to my friends, and brought her forward a little beyond her station; but I little thought a man of Mr. Maxfield\u0027s common sense would have been so utterly led away by kindly-meant patronage.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, I don\u0027t know as it\u0027s so much that, ma\u0027am,\" returned Betty, in a matter-of-fact tone, \"as it is that Jonathan has latterly been thinking a deal about his money. And he knows money will do great thingsâ€”â€”\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Money can never confer gentle birth, my good creature!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, for sure, ma\u0027am. That\u0027s what I say myself. I know my catechism, and I was brought up to respect my superiors. But, you see, Jonathan\u0027s heart is greatly set on his riches. He\u0027s a well-off man, is my brother-in-law; more so than many folks think. He\u0027s been a close man all his life. And, for that matter, he\u0027s close enough now in some things, and screws me down in the housekeeping pretty tight. But for Rhoda he seems to grudge nothing, and wants her to make a show and a splash almostâ€”if you can fancy such a thing of Jonathan! But there\u0027s no saying how men will turn out; not even the old ones. I\u0027m sure I often and often thank my stars I\u0027ve kept singleâ€”no offence to you, ma\u0027am.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Errington went to bed in a bewildered frame of mind. Tired as she was, the news she had heard kept her awake for some time. Leave her lodgings! Leave old Max\u0027s house, which had been her home for so many years! It was incredible. And, indeed, before long she had made up her mind to resist old Max\u0027s intention of turning her out. \"I shall give him a good talking to, to-morrow,\" she said to herself. \"Stupid old man! He really must not be allowed to make himself so absurd.\" And then Mrs. Errington fell asleep. \\n\\n \\n\\n But the next day old Max did not return to be talked to; nor the day after that. James Maxfield went over to Duckwell, and came back bringing a formal notice to Mrs. Errington to quit the lodgings, signed by his father. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What does this mean, James?\" asked Mrs. Errington, with much emphasis, and wide-open eyes. James did not know what it meant. He did not apparently much care, either. He had never been on very friendly terms with the Erringtons (having, indeed, come but seldom in contact with them during all the time they had lived under the same roof with him), and had, perhaps, been a little jealous in his sullen, silent way, of their petting of Rhoda. At all events, on the present occasion, he was not communicative nor very civil. He had performed his father\u0027s behests, and he knew nothing more. His father was not coming back home just yet. And James volunteered the opinion that he didn\u0027t mean to come back until Mrs. Errington should be gone. \\n\\n \\n\\n All this was strange and disagreeable. But Mrs. Errington was not of an irritable or anxious temperament. And her self-complacency was of too solid a kind to be much affected even by ruder rubs than any which could be given by James Maxfield\u0027s uncouth bluntness. \"I shall take no notice whatever of this,\" she said, with serene dignity. \"When your father comes back, I shall talk to him. Meanwhile, I have a great many important things to do.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The good lady did in truth begin at once to busy herself in seeking a house for Algernon, and getting it furnished. There was but a month to make all arrangements in, and all Mrs. Errington\u0027s friends who could by any possibility be pressed into the service were required to assist her. The Docketts; Rose and Violet McDougall; Mrs. Smith, the surgeon\u0027s wife; and even Miss Chubb, were sent hither and thither, asked to write notes, to make inquiries, to have interviews with landlords, and to take as much trouble, and make as much fuss as possible, in the task of getting ready an abode for Mr. and the Honourable Mrs. Algernon Errington. \\n\\n \\n\\n A house was found without much difficulty. It was a small isolated cottage on the outskirts of the town, with a garden behind it which ran down to the meadows bordering the Whit; and was the very house, belonging to Barker the chemist, of which Mrs. Errington had written to her friend Mrs. Bodkin. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was really a very humble dwelling. But the rent of it was quite as large as Algernon would be able to afford. Mrs. Errington said, \"I prefer a small place for them. If they took a more pretentious house, they would be expected to entertain. And you know, my dear sir,\" (or \"madam,\" as the case might be) \"that there is a great mixture in Whitford society; and that would not suit my daughter-in-law, of course. You perceive that, don\u0027t you?\" And then the person so addressed might flatter him or herself with the idea of belonging to the unmixed portion of society. \\n\\n \\n\\n Indeed, this terrible accusation of being \"mixed\" was one which Mrs. Errington was rather fond of bringing against the social gatherings in Whitford. And she had once been greatly offended, and a good deal puzzled, by Mr. Diamond\u0027s asking her what objection there could be to that; and challenging her to point out any good thing on earth, from a bowl of punch upwards, which was not \"mixed!\" But however this might be, no one believed at all that the mixture in Whitford society was the real reason for young Errington\u0027s inhabiting so small a house. They knew perfectly well that if Algernon\u0027s means had been larger, his house would have been larger also. \\n\\n \\n\\n And yet, Mrs. Errington\u0027s flourish was not without its effect on some persons. They in their turn repeated her lamentations on the \"mixture\" to such of their acquaintances as did not happen to be also her acquaintances. And as there were very few individuals in Whitford either so eccentric, or so courageous, as Mr. Diamond, this mysterious mixture was generally acknowledged, with shrugs and head-shakings, to be a very great evil indeed. \\n\\n \\n\\n At the end of about a fortnight, old Max one day reappeared in his own house, and marched upstairs to Mrs. Errington\u0027s sitting-room. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, ma\u0027am,\" said he, without any preliminary greeting whatsoever, \"I suppose you understood the written notice to quit, that I sent you? But as my son James informs me that you don\u0027t seem to be taking any steps in consequence of it, I\u0027ve come to say that you will have to remove out of my abode on the twenty-seventh of this month, and not a day later. So you can act according to your judgment in finding another place to dwell in.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Errington was inspecting the contents of a packing-case which had been sent from London by Lady Seely. It contained, as her ladyship said, \"some odds and ends that would be useful to the young couple.\" The only article of any value in the whole collection was a porcelain vase, which had long stood in obscurity on a side-table in Lord Seely\u0027s study, and would not be missed thence. Lady Seely, at all events, would not miss it, as she seldom entered the room; and therefore she had generously added it to the odds and ends! \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Errington looked up, a little flushed with the exertion of stooping over the packing-case, and confronted Mr. Maxfield. Her round, red full-moon face contrasted in a lively manner with the old man\u0027s grey, lank, harsh visage. The years, as they passed, did not improve old Max\u0027s appearance. And as soon as she beheld him, Mrs. Errington was convinced of the justice of Betty Grimshaw\u0027s remark, that her brother-in-law seemed to have grown closer and crustier than ever of late. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why, Mr. Maxfield,\" said the lady, condescendingly, \"how do you do? I have been wanting to see you. Come, sit down, and let us talk matters over.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Old Max stood in the doorway glaring at her. \"I don\u0027t know, ma\u0027am, as there\u0027s any matters I want to talk over with you,\" he returned. \"You had better understand that I mean what I say. You\u0027ll find it more convenient to believe me at once, and to act accordin\u0027.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Do you mean to say that you intend to turn me out, Mr. Maxfield?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I have given you a legal notice to quit, ma\u0027am. You needn\u0027t call it turning you out, unless you like.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He had begun to move away, when Mrs. Errington exclaimed, \"But I really don\u0027t comprehend this at all! What will Rhoda think of it?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Maxfield stopped, hesitatingly, with his hand on the banisters at the top of the landing. \"Rhoda?\" said he gruffly. \"Oh, Rhoda has nothing to say to it, one way or t\u0027other.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But I want to have something to say to her! I assure you it was a great disappointment to me not to find Rhoda here on my return. I\u0027m very fond of her; and shall continue to be so, as long as she merits it. It is not her fault, poor girl, ifâ€”other people forget themselves.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Maxfield took his hand off the banisters and turned round. \"Since you\u0027re so fond of Rhoda,\" he said, with a queer expression on his sour old face, \"you\u0027ll be glad to know where she is, and the company she\u0027s in.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I know that she is at the seaside with my friends, Mrs. and Miss Bodkin.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"She is at the seaside with her friends, Mrs. and Miss Bodkin. Miss Minnie is a real lady, and she understands how to treat Rhoda, and knows that the Lord has made a lady of Rhoda by natur\u0027.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Errington stared in utter astonishment. The suspicion began to form and strengthen itself in her mind that the old man was positively out of his senses. If so, his insanity had taken an extremely unpleasant turn for her. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I really was not prepared for being turned out of my lodgings after all these years,\" she said, reverting to the point that most nearly touched herself. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ve not been prepared for a many things as have happened after all these years. But I\u0027m ready to meet \u0027em when they come.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, but now, Mr. Maxfield, let us see if we cannot make an arrangement. If you have any different views about the rent, Iâ€”â€”\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The rent! What do you think your bit of a rent matters to me? I want the rooms for the use of my daughter, Miss Maxfield, and there\u0027s an end of it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, he certainly cannot be in his right senses to address me in this manner!\" thought Mrs. Errington. \\n\\n \\n\\n Maxfield went on, \"I see you\u0027ve got a box of rubbish there, littering about the place. I give you warning not to unpack any more here, for out everything \u0027ll have to go on the twenty-seventh of this month, as sure as my name\u0027s Jonathan Maxfield!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mr. Maxfield! You are certainly forgetting yourself. Rubbish, indeed! These are a fewâ€”a very fewâ€”of the valuable wedding presents sent to my son and daughter by Lady Seely.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Old Max made a grating sound which was intended for a laugh, although his bushy grey eyebrows were drawn together in a heavy frown the while. Then he suddenly burst out in a kind of cold fury. \"Pooh!\" he cried. \"Presents! Valuable presents! You don\u0027t deceive anybody by that! Look hereâ€”if the old carpet or any of the furniture in this room would be of any assistance to you, you can take it! I\u0027ll give it to youâ€”a free gift! The place is going to be done up and new furnished for Miss Maxfield. Furnished handsome, fit for a young lady of property. Fit for a young lady that will have a sum o\u0027 money on the day she marriesâ€”if I\u0027m pleased with her choiceâ€”as \u0027ll make some folks\u0027 mouths water. It won\u0027t be reckoned by twenties, nor yet by hundreds, won\u0027t Miss Maxfield\u0027s fortin\u0027! You can take the old carpet, and mahogany table, and the high-backed chairs, and put \u0027em among your valuable presents. They\u0027re too old-fashioned for Miss Maxfield\u0027s drawing-room!\" And with a repetition of the grating laugh, old Max tramped heavily downstairs, and was heard to bang the door of his own parlour. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Errington sat motionless for nearly a quarter of an hour, staring at the open door. \"Mad!\" she exclaimed at length, drawing a long breath. \"Quite mad! But I wonder if there is any truth in what he says about Rhoda\u0027s money? Dear me, why she\u0027ll be quite a catch!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2168/61287.html","bookId":444,"book":{"id":444,"title":"A Charming Fellow","description":"ç®€ä»‹ï¼š The room was very quiet.
