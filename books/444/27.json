{"id":21629,"no":27,"title":"CHAPTER VIII.","content":"Meanwhile Rhoda, at Duckwell Farm, supposed herself to be too unhappy to care much for anything. She did not have a fever, nor fall into a consumption, nor waste away visibly; but she passed hours crying alone in her own room, or sitting idle-handed, whilst her thoughts languidly retraced the past, or strove to picture what sort of a lady Algernon\u0027s wife might be. Headaches, pallid cheeks, and red eyes resulted from these solitary hours. Mrs. Seth Maxfield wondered what had come to the girl, having no suspicion that young Errington\u0027s marriage could be more to Rhoda than an interesting subject for gossip. \\n\\n \\n\\n Old Jonathan went over to Duckwell immediately after receiving the first newspaper, sent by Mrs. Errington from Westmoreland. \\n\\n \\n\\n The announcement of the intended wedding had taken him wholly by surprise. It would be hard to say whether wrath or amazement predominated in his mind, on first reading the paragraph which Mrs. Errington had so complacently marked with red ink. But it is not at all hard to say which feeling predominated within an hour after having read it. \\n\\n \\n\\n According to old Max\u0027s judgment, there was not one extenuating circumstance in Algernon\u0027s behaviour; not one plea to be urged on his behalf. Utter vindictive anger filled the old man\u0027s soul as he read. He had been deceived, played upon, laughed at by this boy! That was the first, and, perhaps, the most venomous of his mortifications. But many other stinging thoughts rankled in his mind. David Powell had been right! That was almost unendurable. As to Rhoda, old Max could not, in the mood he was then in, contemplate her being bowed down by grief and disappointment. He would have her raise her head, and revenge herself on her faithless lover. He would have her successful, admired, and prosperous. He would have her trample on Algernon\u0027s pride and poverty with all the insolence of wealth. Even his beloved money, so hardly earned, so eagerly hoarded, seemed to him, for the first time in his life, to be of small account in comparison with a sentiment. \\n\\n \\n\\n He took his Bible, and gloated over menaces of vengeance and threats of destruction. Future condemnation was, no doubt, in store for Algernon Errington. But that was too vague and too distant a prospect to appease old Max\u0027s stomach for revenge. He wanted to see his enemy in the dust, and that his enemy should be seen there by others. In the midst of his reading, he suddenly recollected the acknowledgment he held of Algernon\u0027s debt to him, and jumped up and ran to his strong-box to feast his eyes on it. It seemed almost like a clear leading from on High that the I.O.U. should come into his head just then, old Max thought. He was not the first, nor the worst man who has wrested Scripture into the service of his own angry passions. \\n\\n \\n\\n Then he sent to order a gig from the \"Blue Bell,\" and set out for Duckwell Farm. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I hope your father isn\u0027t sickening for any disease, or going to get a stroke, or something,\" said Betty Grimshaw to her nephew James. \"But I never see anybody\u0027s face such a colour out of their coffin. It\u0027s a greeny grey, that\u0027s what it is. And he was frowning like thunder.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n But Jonathan Maxfield\u0027s disorder was not of the body. He arrived at Duckwell unexpectedly, but his arrival did not cause any particular surprise. He had business transactions to discuss with his son Seth, to whom he had advanced money on mortgage. And then there was Rhoda staying at the farm, and, of course, her father would like to see Rhoda. \\n\\n \\n\\n Rhoda was called from her own room, and came down, pale and nervous. She dreaded meeting her father. Did he, or did he not, know the news from Westmoreland? It had only come to Duckwell Farm by means of Mr. Pawkins\u0027s servants. It might possibly not yet have reached Whitford. \\n\\n \\n\\n On his side, old Max took care to say nothing about the Applethwaite Advertiser. He had destroyed that journal before leaving home, placing it in the heart of the kitchen fire, and holding it there with the poker, until the remains of it fluttered up the chimney in black, impalpable fragments. \\n\\n \\n\\n But old Max had brought another document in his pocket, which had been placed in his hand just as he was starting in the gig. It was a letter directed to Miss Rhoda Maxfield, High Street, Whitford. And this he pulled out almost immediately on seeing Rhoda. A glance at her face sufficed to show him that she was unhappy and dispirited. \"She has heard it!\" he thought. And something like an anathema upon Algernon followed the thought in his mind. \\n\\n \\n\\n The old man\u0027s countenance was not so clearly read by his daughter; indeed, she hardly raised her eyes to his, but received his kiss in silence. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m afraid, father, you\u0027ll not find Rhoda\u0027s looks doing us credit,\" said Mrs. Seth. \"Why or wherefore I don\u0027t know, but these last days she has been as peaky as can be.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s the heat, maybe,\" said old Max shortly and withdrew his own and Mrs. Seth\u0027s attention from the girl, as she read the letter he handed to her. Rhoda was grateful for this forbearance on her father\u0027s part, although it fluttered her, too, a little, as proving that he was aware of the cause of her dejection, and anxious to shield it from observation. \\n\\n \\n\\n The letter was from Minnie Bodkin. She had written it almost immediately on hearing of Algernon\u0027s intended marriage. It invited Rhoda, if her father would consent, to visit the Bodkins during the remainder of their stay at the seaside. There was no word of allusion to the Erringtons in the letter. Minnie only said, \"Mamma and I remember that your cheeks had lost their roses, somewhat, when we left Whitford. And we think that a breath of sea-breeze may blow them back again. It is some time since you had complete change of air. Tell Mr. Maxfield we will take good care of you.\" And in a postscript Mrs. Bodkin had added, in her small running hand, \"Do come, my dear. We shall be very glad to have you. Dr. Bodkin bids me send you his love.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n It had been no slight effort of self-conquest which had made Minnie Bodkin send for Rhoda, to stay with her at the seaside, and had enabled her to endure the girl\u0027s daily presence, and to stand her friend in word and deed, throughout the weeks which succeeded the announcement of Algernon\u0027s marriage. \\n\\n \\n\\n To be kind to Rhoda at a distance would have been pleasant enough. Minnie would willingly, nay, gladly, have served the girl in any way which should not have necessitated frequent personal communion with her. But she told herself unflinchingly that if she really meant to keep her promise to David Powell, she must do so at some cost of self-sacrifice. The only efficacious thing she could do for Rhoda was to take her away from Whitford scenes and Whitford people for a time; to take her out of the reach of gossiping tongues and unsympathising eyes, and to give her the support of a friendly presence when she should be obliged to face Whitford once more. This would be efficacious help to Rhoda; and Minnie resolved to give it to her. But it was a task to which she felt considerable repugnance. There was an invisible barrier between herself and pretty, gentle, winning Rhoda Maxfield. \\n\\n \\n\\n It is curious to consider of how small importance to most of us actions are, as compared with motives. And perhaps nothing contributes more to hasty accusations of ingratitude than forgetfulness of this truth. We are more affected by what people mean than by what they say, and by what they feel than by what they do. Only when meaning and feeling harmoniously inform the dry husk of words and deeds, can we bring our hearts to receive the latter thankfully, however kind they may sound or seem to uninterested spectators. The egotism of most of us is too exacting to permit of our judging our friends\u0027 behaviour from any abstract point of view; and to be done good to for somebody else\u0027s sake, or even for the sake of a lofty principle, seldom excites very lively satisfaction. \\n\\n \\n\\n Thus Rhoda reproached herself for the unaccountable coldness with which she received Miss Bodkin\u0027s kindness; having only a dim consciousness that Miss Bodkin\u0027s kindness was prompted by motives excellent indeed, but which had little to do with personal sympathy with herself. \\n\\n \\n\\n She silently handed the letter to her father, and turned away to the window. Mrs. Seth bustled out of the room, saying that she must get ready \"a snack of something\" for Mr. Maxfield after his drive, and the father and daughter were left alone together. \\n\\n \\n\\n Jonathan Maxfield\u0027s face brightened wonderfully as he read Minnie\u0027s gracious words. A glow of pleasure came over his hard features. But it was not a very agreeable sort of pleasure to behold, being considerably mingled with malicious triumph. Here was a well-timed circumstance indeed! What could Powell, or such as Powell, say now? Let the Erringtons behave as they might, it was clear henceforward that Rhoda had not been received amongst gentlefolks solely on their account. His girl was liked and made much of for her own sake. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well,\" said he, \"this is a very pretty letter of Miss Minnie\u0027s; very pretty indeed.\" He did not allow his voice to express his exultation, but spoke in his usual harsh, grumbling tones. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes,\" answered Rhoda, tremulously, \"it is very kind of Miss Minnie, and of dear Mrs. Bodkin; wonderfully kind! But Iâ€”I don\u0027t think I want to go, father.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not want to go? Nonsense! That\u0027s mere idle nonsense. Of course you will go. I shall take you down by the coach myself.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh thank you, father, butâ€”I really don\u0027t want change. I don\u0027t care about going to the seaside.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The old man turned upon her almost savagely. \"I say you shall go. You must go. Are you to creep into a hole like a sick beast of the field, and hide yourself from all eyes? There, there,\" he added in a gentler tone, drawing her towards him, as he saw the tears begin to gather in her eyes, \"I am not chiding you, Rhoda. But it will be good for you to accept this call from your kind friends. It will be good for mind and body. You will be quiet there, among fresh scenes and fresh faces. And you will return to Whitford in the company of these gentlefolks, who, it is clear, are minded to stand your friends under all circumstances. Seth\u0027s wife is a worthy woman, but she is not a companion for you, Rhoda.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n One phrase of this speech did seem to offer a glimpse of consolation to Rhoda; the promise, namely, of quiet and fresh scenes, where she and her belongings were utterly unknown. But her father did not know that Minnie Bodkin understood her little love-story from first to last; and that Minnie Bodkin\u0027s presence and companionship might not be calculated to pour the waters of oblivion into her heart. Still she reflected, a day must come when she would have to face Miss Minnie, and all the other Whitford people who knew her. There was no chance of her dying at once and being taken away from it all! And Rhoda\u0027s teaching had made her shrink from the thought of desiring death, as from something vaguely wicked. On the whole, it might be the best thing for her to go to the Bodkins. She would better have liked to continue her solitary rambles in Pudcombe Woods or the meadows at Duckwell; only that now the pain awaited her, every evening, at the farm, of hearing Algernon\u0027s marriage discussed and speculated on. She could not shut out the topic. On the whole, then, it might be the best thing she could do, to get away from Whitford gossip for a time. \\n\\n \\n\\n These considerations Rhoda brought before her own mind, not with any idea that they could avail to decide her line of conduct, but by way of reconciling herself to the line of conduct she should be compelled to take. It never entered her head that any resistance would be possible when once her father had said, \"You must go.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Very well, father,\" she answered meekly, after a short pause. \\n\\n \\n\\n The Bodkins\u0027 invitation was duly communicated to Seth and his wife. And it was arranged that Rhoda should start from the farm without returning to Whitford at all, as a cross road could be reached from Duckwell, where the coach would stop to pick up passengers. \"If there\u0027s any garments you require, beyond those you have here, your aunt Betty shall send them over by the carrier, to-morrow,\" said Mr. Maxfield. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Seth protested (not without a spice of malice) that Rhoda could not possibly want any more clothes, for that she was rigged out already fit for a princess. Nevertheless there did arrive from Whitford several fresh additions to Rhoda\u0027s wardrobe, inclosed in a brand-new black trunk studded with brass-headed nails, and with the initials R. M. traced out in the same shining materials on the lid. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Your father\u0027s well-nigh soft-headed about that girl,\" said Mrs. Seth to her husband, as they stood watching the father and daughter drive away together. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"H\u0027m!\" grunted Seth. \\n\\n \\n\\n His wife went on, \"We may make up our minds as our little ones will never be a penny the better for your father\u0027s money. I\u0027m as sure as sure, it\u0027ll all go to Rhoda.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"As to his will, you may be right,\" returned Seth. \"But I have good hopes that father will cancel that mortgage he holds on the home farm. If he does that, we mustn\u0027t growl too much. \u0027Tis a good lump o\u0027 money. And it would come a deal handier to me if I could have the land free now, than if I waited for father\u0027s death. He\u0027s tough, is father. And the Lord knows I don\u0027t wish him dead neither.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n In this way Rhoda Maxfield went down to the seaside place where the Bodkins were staying, spent about three weeks with them there, and returned in their company to Whitford, to find Mrs. Errington no longer an inmate of her father\u0027s house, the old sitting-room decorated and re-furnished very smartly, and all the circle with whom she had become acquainted at Dr. Bodkin\u0027s on the tiptoe of expectation to behold the Honourable Mrs. Algernon Errington, whose arrival was looked forward to with an amount of interest only understood by those who have ever lived an unoccupied life in a remote provincial town. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2168/61288.html","bookId":444,"book":{"id":444,"title":"A Charming Fellow","description":"ç®€ä»‹ï¼š The room was very quiet.
