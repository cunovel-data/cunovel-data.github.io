{"id":21652,"no":50,"title":"CHAPTER XIV.","content":"Stiff, tired, and cold, Algernon alighted the next morning at the coach-office in London after his night journey. He drove to a fashionable hotel not very far from Lord Seely\u0027s house, and refreshed himself with a warm bath and a luxurious breakfast. By the time that was done it was eleven o\u0027clock in the forenoon. He had been considering how best to proceed, in a leisurely way, during his breakfast, and had decided to go to Lord Seely\u0027s house without further delay. He knew Lady Seely\u0027s habits well enough to feel tolerably sure that she would not be out of her bed before eleven o\u0027clock, nor out of her room before mid-day. He thought he might gain access to his lordship by a coup de main, if he so timed his visit as to avoid encountering my lady. So he had himself driven to within a few yards of the house, and walked up to the well-known door. It was a different arrival from his first appearance on that threshold. Algernon did not fail to think of the contrast, and he told himself that he had been very badly used by the whole Seely family: they had done so infinitely less for him than he had expected! The sense of injury awakened by this reflection was as supporting to him as a cordial. \n \n The servant who opened the door, and who at once recognised Algernon, stared in surprise on seeing him, but was too well trained to express emotion in any other way. After a few inquiries about Lord Seely\u0027s health, Algernon asked if he could be allowed to see his lordship. This, however, was a difficult matter. My lord was better, certainly, the footman said, but my lady had given strict orders that he was not to be disturbed. No one was admitted to his room except the doctor, who would not make his visit until late in the afternoon. \n \n \"Oh, I shouldn\u0027t think of disturbing my lady at this hour,\" said Algernon, \"but I must speak with Lord Seely. It is of the very greatest importance.\" \n \n \"I\u0027ll call Mr. Briggs, sir,\" the footman was beginning, when Algernon stopped him. Mr. Briggs was Lord Seely\u0027s own man, and, like all the servants in the house, was certain to obey his mistress\u0027s orders rather than his master\u0027s, if the two should happen to conflict. Algernon slipped some money into the footman\u0027s hand, together with a note which he had written that morning. \"There, James,\" said he; \"if you will manage to convey that into his lordship\u0027s own hand, I know he will see me. And, moreover, he would be seriously annoyed if I were sent away without having spoken to him on business of very great importance.\" \n \n James reflected that the worst that could happen to him would be a scolding from my lady. That was certainly no trifling evil; but he decided to risk it, being moved to do so not only by the bribe, but by a real liking for young Errington, who was generally a favourite with other people\u0027s servants. \n \n The note which James carried upstairs was as follows:— \n \n \"My Lord,—I write in the driest and most matter-of-fact terms I can find, to ask for an interview with your lordship with the least possible delay, being unwilling to make, or to appear to make, any claim on the regard you once professed for me, or on the connection which unites us, and desiring you to understand that I appeal to you on behalf of another person; and that, were it not for that other person I should ask no more favours of your lordship—nor, perhaps, need any. \n \n \"A. Ancram Errington.\" \n \n In a few moments James came running downstairs and begged Algernon, almost in a whisper, to walk up to his lordship\u0027s room. \n \n Lord Seely was not in bed. He was reclining in an easy-chair, with one foot and leg supported on cushions. He seemed ill and worn, but his dark eyes sparkled as he looked eagerly at Algernon, who entered quietly and closed the door behind him. \"What is it? I\u0027m afraid you have bad news, Ancram,\" said Lord Seely, holding out his hand. \n \n Algernon did not take it. He bowed very gravely, and stood opposite to the little nobleman. \n \n \"Castalia——!\" cried Lord Seely, much dismayed by the young man\u0027s manner. \"Don\u0027t keep me in suspense, for God\u0027s sake! Is she ill? Is she dead?\" \n \n \"No, my lord. Castalia is not dead. Neither, so far as I know, is she ill—in body.\" \n \n \"What is the matter?\" \n \n \"I must crave a patient hearing, my lord. I regret to have to trouble you whilst you are ill and suffering; but what I have to say must be said without delay. May I ask if there is anyone within hearing?\" \n \n \"No! No one. You can close the door of that dressing-closet if you choose. But there is no one there.\" \n \n Algernon adopted the suggestion at once, and then sat down opposite to Lord Seely\u0027s chair. His whole manner of proceeding was so unusual and unexpected that it produced a very painful impression on Lord Seely. Algernon rather enjoyed this. He began to speak with only one distinct purpose in his mind: namely, to frighten his wife\u0027s uncle into making a strong effort to help him out of Whitford. How much pressure would be necessary to achieve that purpose he could not yet tell. And he began to speak with a sort of reckless abandonment of himself to the guidance of the moment, a mood of mind which had become very frequent with him of late. \n \n \"Did your lordship receive a letter from Castalia begging you to obtain a post abroad for me?\" \n \n \"Certainly. My wife answered it. I—I was unable to write myself. But I intended to reply more at length so soon as I should be better.\" \n \n \"Castalia showed me Lady Seely\u0027s reply. That was the first intimation I had of Castalia\u0027s having made such an application. I mention this because I know your lordship suspected me of being the prime mover in all her applications to you for assistance.\" \n \n Lord Seely coloured a little as he replied, \"It was natural to suppose that you influenced your wife, Ancram.\" \n \n \"Your lordship must not judge all cases by your own,\" returned the young man, with a candid raising of his brows; and the colour on Lord Seely\u0027s face deepened to a dark red flush, which faded, leaving him paler than before. \"As I said,\" continued Algernon, \"I did not know what it was that Castalia had asked you to do for us. But, now that I do know it, I may say at once that I heartily concur with her as to its desirability.\" \n \n \"I cannot agree with you there; but, even if it were so, I assure you it is out of my power——\" \n \n \"Allow me, my lord! I must tax your patience to listen to what I have to say before you give me any positive answer.\" \n \n Lord Seely leaned back in his chair, and motioned with his head for Algernon to proceed. The latter went on: \n \n \"Exile from England and from all the hopes and ambitions not very unnatural at my age, is not such an alluring prospect that I should be suspected of having incited Castalia to write as she has done? However, I will say no more as to my own private and personal feelings in the matter. I did not mean to allude to them. I beg your pardon.\" Algernon sat leaning a little forward in his chair. His hands were clasped loosely together, and rested on his knees. He kept his eyes gloomily fixed on the carpet for the most part, and only raised them occasionally to look up at Lord Seely without raising his head at the same time. \"I could not write what I had to say to you, my lord. I dared not write it. Perhaps, even, if I had written, the letter might not have reached you at once; and I could not wish its falling into other hands, so I came away from Whitford last night quite suddenly. I have no leave of absence; the clerk at the post-office, even, did not know I was coming away.\" \n \n \"Do you mean to say, Ancram, that you have deliberately risked the loss of your situation?\" \n \n \"My \u0027situation\u0027 was as good as lost already. Do you know what happened yesterday, Lord Seely? I was subjected to the agreeable ordeal of a visit from the surveyor of the postal district in which Whitford is situated. I was catechised magisterially. The whole office—including my private room—was subjected to a sort of scrutiny. There have been a great many letters missing at Whitford lately; some money-letters. That is to say, letters which should have passed through our office have never reached their destination. Nothing has been traced. Nothing is known with certainty. But the concurrence of various circumstances points to Whitford as the place where the letters have been—stolen. I am told on all hands that such things never happened in Mr. Cooper\u0027s time. (Mr. Cooper was my predecessor as postmaster.) I am scowled at, and almost openly insulted in the streets, by a miller, or a baker, or something of the kind, who lives in the neighbourhood. He declares he has lost a considerable sum of money by the post, and plainly considers me responsible. You may guess how pleasant my \u0027situation\u0027 has become in consequence of these things being known and talked about.\" \n \n \"But, good Heavens, Ancram——! I don\u0027t comprehend your way of looking at the matter. These irregularities are doubtless very distressing, but surely your rational course would be to use every effort to discover the cause of them and set matters right; not run away as if you were a culprit!\" \n \n \"Your lordship judges without knowing all the facts.\" \n \n \"Pardon me, Ancram, but no facts can justify such rash behaviour. I have some experience of men and of the world, and I give you my deliberate opinion that you have acted very indiscreetly, to say the least. I am disappointed in you, Ancram. I regret to say it, but I am disappointed in you. You have shown a want of steadiness, and—and—almost of common sense! The more I think of it, the more I disapprove of the step you have taken. It shows a great want of consideration for others; for your wife. If you were alone it might be pardonable—although, excessively ill-judged—to throw up your post at the first experience of the rough side of things. We all have difficulties to contend with. The most exalted position is not secure from them, as, indeed, it would appear almost superfluous to point out! The record of my own—my own—official life might supply you with more than one example of the value of steadfast energy, and an inflexible determination to conquer antagonistic circumstances.\" \n \n Poor Lord Seely! He had been subdued by sickness more completely under the dominion of his wife than could ever be the case when he was able to move about, to get away from her, and to converse with persons who were not entirely devoid of any semblance of respect for his opinion. Lady Seely, it might be said, respected nobody—a point of resemblance between herself and her young kinsman which had not led to any very great sympathy or harmony between them; for, as it is your professed joker who can least bear to be laughed at, so those persons who most flippantly ignore any sentiment of reverence towards others are by no means prepared to tolerate a want of deference towards themselves. Certainly, my lady had snubbed her husband during his illness almost unmercifully; she wished him to get better, and she took care that the doctor\u0027s orders were faithfully carried out. But her course of treatment was anything but soothing to the spirit, and my lord\u0027s pet vanities received no consideration whatever from her. His mind being now relieved from the first shock of apprehension which Algernon\u0027s sudden visit had occasioned (for, though things were bad, it was a relief to him to find that Castalia was safe and well), he could not resist the temptation to lecture a little, and be pompous, and display his suppressed self-esteem with a little more emphasis than usual. \n \n Poor Lord Seely! By so doing he unconsciously drew down a terrible catastrophe. It seemed a trivial cause to determine Algernon to speak as he next spoke—as trivial as the heedless footfall or too-loudly spoken word which brings the avalanche toppling down from the rock. \n \n \"The selfishness and egotism of the man are incredible!\" thought Algernon, looking at Lord Seely. \"Not one word of sympathy with me! Not a syllable to show that my feelings are worthy of any consideration whatever. Pompous little ass!\" Then he said, very gravely and quietly, \"I think, my lord, that you have forgotten what I said to you in the hurried note I sent upstairs, about appealing to you on behalf of another person.\" \n \n Lord Seely had forgotten it. \n \n \"Ha!—no, Ancram. I—I remember what you said; but, I—I take leave to think that if you wish to consider that other person—it is your wife of whom you spoke, I presume?\" \n \n Algernon bowed his head. \n \n \"If you wish to consider that person effectually, you ought not to have flown off at a tangent in the manner you have done. You might—ahem!—you might, at least, have written to me for advice.\" \n \n \"Lord Seely, I am sorry to say that you are under an entire misapprehension as to the state of the case.\" \n \n Lord Seely was not accustomed to be told that he was under an entire misapprehension on any subject. \n \n \"If so, Ancram,\" he answered, with some hauteur, \"the fault must be yours. I believe I should succeed in comprehending any moderately clear and accurate statement.\" \n \n \"I will try to speak plainly. During the last six weeks I have been made seriously unhappy by rumours floating about in Whitford respecting my wife.\" \n \n \"Rumours——! Respecting your wife?\" \n \n \"They reach my ears through various channels, and appear to be rife in every social circle in the place.\" \n \n \"Rumours! Of what nature?\" \n \n There was a little pause; then Algernon said, \"The least terrible of them is, that Castalia\u0027s reason is affected, and that she is not responsible for her actions.\" \n \n Lord Seely started into a more upright posture, and then sank back again with a suppressed cry of pain. Algernon went on, without looking up: \"Her manner has been very singular of late. She has taken to wandering about alone, and to make her wanderings as secretly as may be; she haunts the post-office in my absence, carefully informing herself beforehand whether I am in my private room or not; and if I am reported absent, she enters it, searches the drawers, and, I have the strongest reason to believe—indeed I may say I know—that she has tampered with a little cabinet in which I keep a few private papers, and taken letters out of it!\" \n \n \"Ancram!\" \n \n \"These things, my lord, are commonly reported and spoken of by every gossiping tongue in Whitford. I can\u0027t help the people talking. Castalia is not liked there; her manners are unpopular, and even the persons who were inclined to receive her kindly for my sake have been offended and alienated. Still, the things I have told you are facts.\" \n \n \"I am shocked—I am surprised—and, forgive me, Ancram, a little incredulous. You may have listened to malicious tongues; you say that my niece is not liked by the—the class of persons with whom she now associates, and it may be——\" \n \n \"I am sorry to say, my lord, that Castalia cannot be said to associate with any \u0027class of persons\u0027 in Whitford, for latterly it has become plain to me that all our acquaintances have given her the cold shoulder.\" \n \n The mingled expression of amazement, incredulity, and offended pride on Lord Seely\u0027s face, when Algernon made this announcement, did not operate with the latter as an inducement to spare him. Indeed, he had now gone almost too far to stop short. He held up his hand to deprecate any interruption, and said, \"One moment, my lord! I must ask you a question. Have you at any time privately supplied Castalia with money unknown to me?\" \n \n \"Never! I——\" \n \n \"Then, Lord Seely, I have only one more circumstance to add: Castalia, the other day, paid a bill of considerable amount to a mercer in Whitford without my knowledge, and without my knowing where she found the money to pay it; and yesterday my clerk, an honest fellow and much attached to me, told me in private and in strict confidence, that it was currently reported in the town that one of the notes paid by my wife to the mercer was endorsed in the same way as a note in one of the missing money-letters I have told you of.\" \n \n \"Good God, Ancram! what do you mean?\" \n \n \"I told you that the least terrible rumour about Castalia was the rumour that her mind was affected.\" \n \n Lord Seely\u0027s face was almost lead-coloured. He pressed his hands one on each side of his head with a gesture of hopeless bewilderment. \"This is the most appalling thing!\" he murmured, and his voice was scarcely audible as he said it. \n \n \"I had to make my choice without delay, Lord Seely. I regret to inflict this blow on you in your present suffering state of body; but, if I spared you, I could not have spared Castalia. I chose to spare my wife.\" \n \n \"Yes, yes;—quite—quite right. Spare Castalia! I—I thank you, Ancram—for choosing to spare her rather than me.\" The poor little nobleman\u0027s face was convulsed by a kind of spasm for a second or two, and then he burst into tears, sobbing out, with his face hidden in his trembling hands, \"What is to be done? Gracious heavens! what is to be done?\" \n \n \"I talked about choosing to spare Castalia,\" said Algernon, looking at her uncle with a sort of furtive curiosity and a feeling that was more akin to contempt than pity, \"but I don\u0027t know how long it may be in my power, or anyone\u0027s power, to spare her. The only chance for either of us is to get away out of Whitford as quickly as possible.\" \n \n \"But—but——My head is so confused. I am stunned, Ancram—stunned! But—what was I going to say? Oh! have you interrogated Castalia? What representations does she make as to the money? There is so much to be said—to be asked. It cannot be but that there is some error. It cannot be. My poor Castalia!\" \n \n \"Interrogating Castalia would be quite useless; worse than useless. You don\u0027t know what her behaviour and temper have been lately. She is utterly unreasonable. Ask anyone who knows our house in Whitford; ask my servants what my home has been latterly. I have bought the honour of your lordship\u0027s alliance somewhat dear.\" \n \n Lord Seely sank down in his chair as if he had been struck, and his grey head drooped on his breast. \"What can I do, Ancram?\" he asked, in a tone so contrasted in its feebleness with his usual self-assured, rather strident voice, that it might have touched some persons with compassion. \"What can I do?\" Then he seemed to make a strong effort to recover some energy of manner, and added, \"If it were not for this unfortunate attack which disables me, I would return with you to Whitford to-night. I would see Castalia myself.\" \n \n Algernon heartily congratulated himself on the fit of gout which kept Lord Seely a prisoner. There was nothing he less desired than that her uncle should be confronted with Castalia. He represented that the only efficacious help Lord Seely could give under the circumstances would be to furnish them with money to pay their debts and leave Whitford forthwith. He pointed out that Castalia must have felt this herself, when she wrote urging her uncle to get them some post abroad. Algernon became eager and persuasive as he spoke, and offered a glimpse to the man before him, whose pride and whose affections were equally wounded, of a future which should make some amends for the bitter present—a future in which Castalia might have peace and safety at least, and in which her mind might regain its balance. He would be gentle, and patient, and tender with her; and, if they were in a position that offered no such temptations as the post-office at Whitford, the anxiety to all who regarded Castalia would be greatly lessened. Lord Seely was, as he had said, too much stunned by the whole interview to follow Algernon\u0027s rapid eloquence step by step. He felt that he must have time for reflection; besides, he was physically exhausted. He bade Algernon leave him for a time, and return later in the day. He would give orders that he should be admitted at once. \"You—you have not seen my lady?\" said Lord Seely hesitatingly. \n \n \"No; I purposely avoided doing so. She would have naturally inquired the cause of my unexpected presence in town, and I could speak of all this trouble to nobody on earth but yourself, my lord.\" \n \n \"Right, right, Ancram. But my lady will not fail to learn that you have been here, and we must give her some reason.\" \n \n \"I can say, if you choose, that I came to London on post-office business.\" \n \n Lord Seely bowed his head almost humbly, and Algernon left him. He left him with an air of sombre resignation, but inwardly he felt himself to be master of the situation. \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2168/61311.html","bookId":444,"book":{"id":444,"title":"A Charming Fellow","description":"简介： The room was very quiet.
