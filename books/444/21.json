{"id":21623,"no":21,"title":"CHAPTER II.","content":"Minnie Bodkin had loyally tried to keep the promise she had given to the Methodist preacher respecting Rhoda Maxfield, but in so trying she had encountered many obstacles. In the first place, Rhoda, with all her gentleness, was not frank, and she opposed a passive resistance to all Minnie\u0027s efforts to win her confidence on the subject of Algernon. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It is like poking a little frightened animal out of its hole, trying to get anything from her!\" said Minnie, impatiently. \\n\\n \\n\\n Not that Rhoda\u0027s reticence was wholly due to timidity. She knew instinctively that she was to be warned against giving her heart to Algernon Errington; that she should hear him blamed; or, at least, that the unreasonableness of trusting in his promises, or taking his boyish love-making in serious earnest, would be safely set forth by Miss Bodkin. Rhoda had not perceived any of the wise things which might be said against her attachment to Algernon in the beginning, but now she thought she perceived them all. And she was resolved, with a sort of timid obstinacy, not to listen to them. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure Algy\u0027s fond of me. And even if he has changed\"—the supposition brought tears into her eyes as the words framed themselves in her mind—\"I don\u0027t want to have him spoken unkindly of.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n But, in truth, latterly her hopes had been out-weighing her fears. In most of his letters to his mother Algernon had spoken of her, and had sent her his love. He was making friends, and looking forward hopefully to getting some definite position. Even her father spoke well of Algernon now;—said how clever he was, and what grand acquaintance he was making, and how sure he would be to succeed. And once or twice her father had dropped a word which had set Rhoda\u0027s heart beating, and made the colour rush into her face, for it seemed as if the old man had some idea of her love for Algy, and approved it! All these circumstances together made Minnie\u0027s task of mentor a rather hopeless one. \\n\\n \\n\\n And then Minnie herself, although, as has been said, loyally anxious to fulfil her promise to David Powell, began to think that he had overrated the importance of interfering with Rhoda\u0027s love-story if love-story it were. Powell lived in a state of exalted and, perhaps, overstrained feeling, and attributed his own earnestness to slighter natures. Of course, on the side of worldly wisdom there was much to be said against Rhoda\u0027s fancying herself engaged to Algernon Errington. There was much to be said; and yet Minnie did not feel quite sure that the idea was so preposterous as Powell had appeared to think it. True, Mrs. Errington was vain, and worldly, and ambitious for her son. True, Algernon was volatile, selfish, and little more than twenty years of age. But still there was one solid fact to be taken into account, which, Minnie thought, might be made to outweigh all the obstacles to a marriage between the two young people—the solid fact, namely, of old Maxfield\u0027s money. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If Algernon married a wife with a good dower, and if the wife were as pretty, as graceful, and as well-mannered as Rhoda, I do not suppose that anybody would concern himself particularly with her pedigree,\" thought Minnie. \"And even if any one did, that difficulty would not be insuperable, for I have no knowledge of Mrs. Errington, if within three months of the wedding she had not invented a genealogy, only second to her own, for her son\u0027s wife, and persuaded herself of its genuineness into the bargain!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n As to those other convictions which would have made such a marriage horrible to David Powell, even had it been made with the hearty approval of all the godless world, Minnie did not share them. She did not believe that Rhoda\u0027s character had any spiritual depth; and she thought it likely enough that she would be able to make Algernon happy, and to be happy as his wife. \"Algy is not base, or cruel, or vicious,\" she said to herself. \"He has merely the faults of a spoiled child. A woman with more earnestness than Rhoda has would weary him; and a wiser woman might, in the long run, be wearied by him. She is pretty, and sufficiently intelligent to make a good audience, and so humble-minded that she would never be exacting, but would gratefully accept any scraps of kindness and affection which Algy might feel inclined to bestow on her. And that would react upon him, and make him bestow bigger scraps for the pleasure of being adored for his generosity.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And there were times when she felt very angry with Rhoda;—Rhoda, who turned away from the better to choose the worse, and who was coldly insensible to the fact that Matthew Diamond was in love with her. Nay, had she been cognisant of the fact, she would, Minnie felt sure, have shrank away from the grave, clever gentleman who, as it was, could win nothing warmer from her than a sort of submissive endurance of his presence, and a humble acknowledgment that he was very kind to take notice of an ignorant little thing like her. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was with strangely mingled feelings that Minnie, watching day by day from her sofa or easy-chair, perceived the girl\u0027s utter indifference to Diamond. How much would Minnie have given for one of those rare sweet smiles to beam upon her, which were wasted on Rhoda\u0027s pretty, shy, downcast face! How happy it would have made her to hear those clear, incisive tones lowered into soft indistinctness for her ears, as they so often were for Rhoda\u0027s, who would look timid and tired, and answer, \"Yes, sir,\" and \"No, sir,\" until Minnie\u0027s nervous sympathy with Diamond\u0027s disappointment, and irritation against him for being disappointed, grew almost beyond her own control. \\n\\n \\n\\n One May evening, when the cuckoo was sending his voice across the purling Whit from distant Pudcombe Woods, and the hyacinths in Minnie\u0027s special flower-stand were pouring out their silent even-song in waves of perfume, five persons were sitting in Mrs. Bodkin\u0027s drawing-room, the windows of which looked towards the west. They were listening to the cuckoo, and smelling the sweet breath of the hyacinths, and gazing at the rosy sky, and dropping now and then a soft word, which seemed to enhance the sweetness and the silence of the room. The five persons were Minnie Bodkin, Rhoda Maxfield, Matthew Diamond, Mr. Warlock (the curate of St. Chad\u0027s), and Miss Chubb. The latter was embroidering something in Berlin wools, as usual; but the peace of the place, and of the hour, seemed to have fallen on her, as on the rest, and she sat with her work in her lap, looking across the stand of hyacinths, very still and quiet. \\n\\n \\n\\n The Reverend Peter also sat looking silently across the hyacinths, but it was at the owner. Minnie\u0027s cheek rested on her thin white hand, and her lustrous eyes had a far-away look in them, as they gazed out towards Pudcombe Woods, where the cuckoo was calling his poet-loved syllables with a sweet, clear tone, that seemed to have gathered all the spirit of the spring into one woodland voice. \\n\\n \\n\\n Rhoda sat beside the window, and was sewing very gently and noiselessly, but seemingly intent upon her work, and unconscious that the eyes of Mr. Diamond—who was seated close to Minnie\u0027s chair—were fixed upon her, and that in some vague way he was attributing to her the perfume of the flowers, and the melancholy-sweet note of the bird, and the melted rubies of the western sky. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What a sunset!\" said Miss Chubb, breaking the silence. But she spoke almost in a whisper, and her voice did not startle any ear. Mr. Warlock, habituated to suppress his feelings and adapt his words to those of his company, answered, after a little pause, \"Lovely indeed! It is an evening to awaken the sensibilities of a feeling heart.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It makes me think of Manchester Square. We had some hyacinths in pots, too, I remember, when I was staying with the Bishop of Plumbunn.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Miss Chubb\u0027s odd association of ideas was merely due to the fact that her thoughts were flying back to the rose-garden of youth. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Do you not like to hear the cuckoo, Miss Bodkin?\" said Diamond, softly, speaking almost in her ear. She started, and turned her head towards him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes; no. I like it, although it makes me sad. I like it because it makes me sad perhaps.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"All sights, and sounds, and scents seem to me to be combined this evening into something sweeter than words can say.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It is a fine evening, and the cuckoo is calling from Pudcombe Woods, and my hyacinths are of a very good sort. It seems to me that words can manage to say that much with distinctness!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What a pity,\" thought Diamond, \"that head overshadows heart in this attractive woman! She is too keen, too cool, too critical. A woman without softness and sentiment is an unpleasant phenomenon. And I think she has grown harder in her manner than she used to be.\" Then the reflection crossed his mind that her health had been more frail and uncertain than usual of late, and that she bore much physical suffering with high courage; and the little prick of resentment he had begun to feel was at once mollified. He answered aloud, with a slow smile, \"Why, yes, words may manage to say all that. I wonder if I may ask you a question? It is one I have long wished to ask.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You may, certainly.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There are questions that should not be asked.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I will trust you not to ask any such.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Now when she looks and speaks like that, she is adorable!\" thought Diamond, meeting the soft light of Minnie\u0027s lovely, pathetic eyes, which fell immediately before his own. \"I wish I might have you for a friend, Miss Bodkin,\" he said. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I think you have your wish. I thought you knew you had it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ah, yes; you are always good, and kind, and—and—but you—I will make a clean breast of it, and pay you the compliment of telling you the truth. I have thought latterly that you were hardly so cordial, so frank in your kindness to me as you once were. It would matter nothing to me in another person, but in you, a little shade of manner matters a great deal. I don\u0027t believe there is another human being to whom I would say so much. For I am—as perhaps you know—a man little given to thrust myself where I am not welcome.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You are about the proudest and most distant person I ever knew, and require to be very obviously implored before you condescend to easy friendship with anyone.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Minnie laughed, as she spoke, a little low rippling laugh, which she ended with a forced cough, to hide the sob in her throat. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No; not proud. You misjudge me; but it is true that I dread, almost more than anything else, being deemed intrusive.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If that fear has prevented you from putting the question to which you have so long desired an answer, pray ask it forthwith.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I think it has almost answered itself,\" said Diamond, bending over her, and turning his chair so as to cut her and himself off still more from the others. \"I was going to ask you if I had unwittingly offended you in any way, or if my frequent presence here were, for any reason, irksome to you? It might well be so. And if you would say so candidly, believe me, I should feel not the smallest resentment. Sorrow I should feel. I can\u0027t deny it; but I should not cease to regard you as I have always regarded you from the beginning of our acquaintance. How highly that is, I have not the gift to tell; nor do you love the direct, broadly-spoken praise that sounds like flattery, be it ever so sincere.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No; please don\u0027t praise me,\" said Minnie, huskily. She was shadowed by his figure as he sat beside her, and so he did not see the tears that quivered in her eyes. After a second or two, during which she had passed her handkerchief quickly, almost stealthily, across her face, she said, \"But your question, you say, has answered itself.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I hope so; I hope I may believe that there is nothing wrong between us.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Nothing.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I have not offended you in any way!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Nor unwittingly hurt you? I daresay I am awkward and abrupt sometimes.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Pray believe that I have nothing in the world to blame you for.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Thank you. I know you speak sincerely. Your friendship is very precious to me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She answered nothing, but hesitatingly put out her hand, which he grasped for an instant, and would have raised to his lips, but that she drew it suddenly away, murmuring something about her cushions being awry, and trying tremblingly to rearrange them. \\n\\n \\n\\n He moved the cushions that supported her shoulders with a tender, careful touch, and placed them so that her posture in the lounging-chair might be easier. She clasped her hands together and laid her head back wearily. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You don\u0027t know how precious your friendship is to me,\" he went on lowering his voice still more. \"I never had a sister. But I have often thought how sweet the companionship of a sister must be. I am very much alone in the world; and, if I dared, I would speak to you with fraternal confidence.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Pray speak so,\" answered Minnie, almost in a whisper. \"I should like—to be—of some comfort to you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n There was a silence. It was scarcely broken by Miss Chubb\u0027s murmured remark to Mr. Warlock, that the moon was beginning to make a ring of light behind the poplar trees on the other side of the Whit, like the halo round the head of a saint. The twilight deepened, Rhoda\u0027s fingers ceased to ply the needle, but she remained at the window looking over at the moonlit poplars, while Miss Chubb\u0027s voice softly droned out some rambling speech, which jarred no more on the quietude of the hour than did the ripple of the river. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You have been so good to her!\" said Diamond suddenly, under cover of this murmur; and then paused for a moment as if awaiting a reply. Minnie did not speak. Presently he went on. \"You know her and understand her better than any of the people here.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I think every one likes Rhoda,\" said Minnie at length. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes,\" Diamond answered eagerly. \"Yes; do they not? But it requires the delicate tact of a refined woman to overcome her shyness. I never saw so timid a creature. Has it not struck you as strange that she should have come out from that vulgar home so entirely free from vulgarity?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Rhoda has great natural refinement.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You appreciate her thoroughly. And, then, the repulsive and ludicrous side of Methodism has not touched her at all. It is marvellous to me to see her so perfect in grace and sweetness.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I do not think that Methodism has ever taken deep hold on Rhoda.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And yet it is strange that it should be so. She was exposed to the influence of David Powell. And, although he has fine qualities, he is ignorant and fanatical.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"His ignorance and fanaticism are mere spots on the sun!\" cried Minnie. And now, as she spoke, her voice was stronger, and she raised her head from the cushion. \"In his presence the Scripture phrase, \u0027A burning and a shining light,\u0027 kept recurring to me. How poor and dark one\u0027s little selfish self seems beside him!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Diamond slightly raised his eyebrows as he answered, \"Powell has undoubtedly very genuine enthusiasm and fervour. But he might be a dangerous guide to undisciplined minds.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He would sacrifice himself, he does sacrifice himself, for undisciplined and ungrateful minds, with whom, I own, my egotism could not bear so patiently.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n But it was not of Powell that Matthew Diamond wished to speak now. Under the softening influences of the twilight, and the unaccustomed charm of pouring out the fulness of his heart to such a confidante as Minnie, he could talk of nothing but Rhoda. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Perhaps I am a fool to keep singeing my wings,\" he said. \"It may be all in vain. But don\u0027t you believe that a strong and genuine love is almost sure to win a woman\u0027s heart, provided the woman\u0027s heart is free to be won?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Perhaps—provided——\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And you do not think hers is free?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How can I answer you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I know that Powell thought there was some one trifling with her affections. It was on that subject that he begged for the interview with you. I have never asked any questions about that interview, but I have guessed since, from many little signs and tokens, that the person he had in his mind was young Errington.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then the matter cannot be serious. He was little more than a boy when he left Whitford.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But Rhoda was turned nineteen when Algernon went away.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Diamond started eagerly forward, with his hand on the arm of the chair, and fixing his eyes anxiously on her face, said: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Minnie, tell me the truth! Do you think she cares for him?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n It was the first time he had ever addressed Minnie by her Christian-name; and she marked the fact with a chilly feeling at the heart. \"You ask for the truth?\" she said, sadly. \"Yes; I do think so.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Diamond leant his head on his hand for a minute in silence. Then he raised his face again and answered, \"Thank you for answering with sincerity. But I knew you would do no otherwise. This feeling for Algernon must be half made up of childish memories. I cannot believe it is an earnest sentiment that will endure.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Nothing endures.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If I know myself at all, my love will endure. I am a resolute man, and do not much regard external obstacles. The only essential point is, can she ever be brought to care for me?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n There was a pause. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Do you think she might—some day?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Is that the only essential point?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes; to me it is so. I do believe that it would be for her happiness to care for me, rather than for that selfish young fellow.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And—for your happiness——?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, of that I am not doubtful at all!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There\u0027s the moon above the poplar trees!\" cried Miss Chubb. And as she spoke a silver beam stole into the room and lighted one or two faces, leaving the others in shadow. Amongst the faces so illuminated was Minnie Bodkin\u0027s. \"Did you ever see anything so beautiful as Minnie\u0027s countenance in the moonlight?\" whispered Miss Chubb to the curate. \"She looks like a spirit!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Poor Mr. Warlock sighed. He had been envying Diamond his long confidential conversation with the doctor\u0027s daughter. \"She is always beautiful,\" he replied. \"But I think she looks unusually sad to-night.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s the moon, my dear sir! Bless you, it always gives a pensive expression to the eyes; always!\" And Miss Chubb cast her own eyes upwards towards the sky as she spoke. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Dear me, you have no lamp here!\" said a voice, which, though mellow and musical in quality, was too loud and out of harmony with the twilight mood of the occupants of the drawing-room to be pleasant. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Is not that silver lamp aloft there sufficient, Mrs. Errington?\" asked Diamond. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, good evening, Mr. Diamond,\" returned Mrs. Errington, with perhaps an extra tone of condescension, for she thought in her heart that the tutor was a little spoiled in Whitford society. \"I can hardly make out who\u0027s who. Oh, there\u0027s Miss Chubb and Mr. Warlock, and—oh, is that you, Rhoda? Well, Minnie, I left your mamma giving the doctor his tea in the study, and she sent me upstairs. And, if you have no objection, I should like the lamp lit, for I am going to read you a letter from Algy.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2168/61282.html","bookId":444,"book":{"id":444,"title":"A Charming Fellow","description":"简介： The room was very quiet.
