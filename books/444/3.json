{"id":21605,"no":3,"title":"CHAPTER III.","content":"Mrs. Errington had lodged in Mr. Maxfield\u0027s house ever since she first came to Whitford. Jonathan Maxfield, commonly called \"Old Max,\" kept a general shop in that town. The shop was underneath Mrs. Errington\u0027s sitting-room, and the great bow window, of which mention has been made, jutted out beyond the shop front, and overhung the street. The house was old, and larger than it appeared from the street, running back some distance. There was a private entrance—a point much insisted upon by Mr. Maxfield\u0027s sister-in-law and housekeeper in letting the lodgings to Mrs. Errington—and a long passage divided the shop entirely from the dwelling rooms on the ground-floor. \\n\\n \\n\\n Old Max was reported to be somewhat of a miser (which report he rather encouraged than the reverse, finding that it had its conveniences), and to have amassed a large sum of money for one in his position in life. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Old Max!\" Whitford people would say. \"Why, old Max could buy up half the town. Old Max might retire to-morrow. Old Max has no need ever to stand behind a counter again.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Old Max, however, continued to stand behind his counter day after day, as he had done for the last thirty or forty years, and would serve a child with a pennyworth of gingerbread, or a rich man\u0027s cook with stores of bacon and flour, in an impartially crabbed manner. \\n\\n \\n\\n He was a grey man: grey from head to foot. He had grey hair, closely cropped; twinkling grey eyes; and a grey stubble on his shaven chin. He usually wore a suit of coarse grey clothes, with black calico sleeves tied on at the elbow. But even these had an iron-grey hue, from being more or less dusted with flour; as, indeed, were all his garments, and even his face. \\n\\n \\n\\n When Mrs. Errington first came to live in Whitford, Jonathan Maxfield was a widower for the second time. He had two sons by his first wife; and, by his second, one daughter, whose birth cost her mother\u0027s life. The sister of his first wife had kept house for him ever since his second widowhood. This woman, Betty Grimshaw by name, had been servant in a great family; and at her master\u0027s death had received a legacy, which, together with her own savings, had sufficed to purchase a small annuity. She had been able to lay by the greater part of her annuity since she had lived in Whitford, and announced her intention of bequeathing her savings to her nephew James, Maxfield\u0027s second son. The elder son had married a farmer\u0027s daughter with some money, and turned farmer himself within a few miles of Whitford. Thus the family living at home on the autumn night on which our story opens, consisted of Jonathan Maxfield, Betty Grimshaw his sister-in-law, his son James, and his daughter Rhoda. \\n\\n \\n\\n The sound of the street-door closing violently behind Mr. Diamond, startled this family party assembled in the parlour, together with Mr. David Powell, Methodist preacher. \\n\\n \\n\\n They were all seated at a table, on which lay hymn-books and a large bible. Old Maxfield sat nearest to the fire, in his grey suit, just as he appeared in his shop, except that the black calico sleeves had been removed from his coat. He had a harsh face, a harsh voice, and a harsh manner. So much could be observed by any who exchanged ten words with him. \\n\\n \\n\\n Next to him, on his left hand, sat his son James, a tall, sickly-looking young man, of six-and-twenty. He had a stoop in the shoulders, a pale face, with high cheek-bones, eyes deeply set, light eyebrows, which grew in thick irregular tufts, and hair of a reddish flaxen colour. There was a certain family likeness between him and his aunt, Mrs. Grimshaw, as she was called in Whitford, despite her spinsterhood. She too was tall, bony, and hard-featured; with a face which looked as if it had been painted and varnished, and reminded one, in its colour and texture, of those hollow wooden pears, full of tiny playthings, which used to be—and probably still are—sold at country fairs, and in toy-shops of a humble kind. \\n\\n \\n\\n The preacher sat next to Betty Grimshaw. He seemed to belong to a different order of beings from the three persons already described. \\n\\n \\n\\n A striking face this—dark, and full of fire. He had sharply-cut, handsome features, and eyes that seemed to blaze with inward light when he spoke earnestly. His raven-black hair was worn long, and fell straight on to his collar. But although this made his aspect strange, it could not render it either vulgar or ludicrous. The black locks set off his pale dark face, as in a frame of ebony. He was young, and seemed vigorous, though rather with nervous energy than muscular strength. \\n\\n \\n\\n The last person in the group was Rhoda Maxfield—\"little Rhoda,\" as Mrs. Errington had called her. But the epithet had been used to express rather her social insignificance, than her physical proportions. Rhoda was, in fact, rather tall. She was about nineteen years old, but scarcely looked her age. She had a broad and beautiful brow, on which the rich chestnut hair was smoothly parted; a sensitive mouth, not over-small; and bright hazel eyes, which looked out on the world with an open gaze, that was at once timid and confiding. Her skin was of remarkable delicacy, with a faint flush on the cheeks, which came and went frequently. \\n\\n \\n\\n And yet Rhoda Maxfield was not much admired among her own compeers. There was something in her face which did not please the taste of the vulgar. And although, if you had asked Whitford persons \"Is not Rhoda Maxfield wonderfully pretty?\" most of those so addressed would have answered, \"Yes, Rhoda is a pretty girl;\" yet the assent would probably have been cold and uncertain. \\n\\n \\n\\n Rhoda, at nineteen years old, had never been known to have a sweetheart. And this fact militated against the popular appreciation of her beauty; for a very cursory observation of the world will suffice to show that on the score of good looks, as on most other subjects, public opinion is apt to find nothing successful but success. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What a wind there must be, to make the door bang like that!\" exclaimed Betty Grimshaw, when the loud sound above recorded reached her ears. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Who went out?\" asked James. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I suppose it would be that Mr. Diamond, the schoolmaster,\" replied his aunt. \\n\\n \\n\\n They both spoke in a subdued voice, and cast furtive glances at Mr. Maxfield, as though fearful of being reprehended for interrupting the evening devotions; but, as they spoke, he closed his hymn-book, and drew his chair away from the table towards the fireside. Upon this signal, Betty Grimshaw rose and bustled out of the room, declaring that she must see about getting the supper; for that that little Sarah could never be trusted to see to the roasted potatoes alone. There was a suspicious alacrity in Betty\u0027s departure, suggestive that she experienced some sense of relief at the breaking-up of the devotions. James soon sauntered out of the room after his aunt. Mr. Powell rose. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Good night,\" said he, holding out his hand to the old man. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Nay; won\u0027t you stay and eat with us, Brother Powell? The supper will be ready directly.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Powell shook his head. \"You know I never eat supper,\" he said, smiling. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, well; perhaps you\u0027re in the right,\" responded old Max, very readily. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And I am not clear,\" continued the preacher, \"but that it would be better for you to leave off the habit.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Me? Oh, no! I need it for my health\u0027s sake.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But would it not suit your health better, to take your supper early? Say at six o\u0027clock or so; so that you should not go to bed with a full stomach.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No; it wouldn\u0027t,\" answered the old man, crabbedly. \\n\\n \\n\\n David Powell stood meditating, with his hand to his chin. \"I am not clear about it,\" he murmured. But Maxfield either did not hear, or chose to ignore the words. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Father, may I go upstairs to Mrs. Errington?\" asked Rhoda, softly; \"I don\u0027t want any supper.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The old man grunted out an inarticulate sound, and seemed to hesitate. \"Go upstairs to Mrs. Errington?\" he said, answering his daughter, but looking sideways at the preacher. \"Let\u0027s see; you promised, didn\u0027t you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes; you gave me leave, and I promised before—before we knew that Mr. Powell would come to-night.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Rhoda was gifted with a sweet voice by nature, and she spoke with a purer accent, and expressed herself with greater propriety, than the other members of her family. Mrs. Errington had amused herself with teaching the motherless girl, who had been a lonely, shy, little child when their acquaintance first began. And Rhoda was a quick and apt scholar. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well—a promise—I can\u0027t have you break your word. Don\u0027t you stay late, mind. Not one minute after ten o\u0027clock; do you mind, Rhoda?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Rhoda, with a bright smile of pleasure on her face, promised to obey, and left the room with a step which it cost her an effort to make as staid as she knew would be approved by her father and Mr. Powell. When she got outside the door, they heard her run along the passage as light and as swift as a greyhound. \\n\\n \\n\\n Maxfield turned to Mr. Powell, with a little constrained, apologetic air, and began expatiating on Mrs. Errington\u0027s fondness for Rhoda; and how kind she had always been to the girl; and how he thought it a duty almost, to let the good, widowed lady have as much of Rhoda\u0027s company as she could give her without neglecting duties. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Betty Grimshaw is a worthy woman,\" he observed, drily; \"but no companion for my Rhoda. Rhoda features her mother, and has her mother\u0027s nature very much.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Powell still stood in the same meditative attitude, with his hand to his chin. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"This Mrs. Errington is unconverted?\" he said, without raising his eyes. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, Rhoda won\u0027t take much harm from that!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Much harm?\" The dark lustrous eyes were upraised now, and fixed searchingly on the old man. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, it won\u0027t do her any harm,\" the latter answered, testily. \"I know Rhoda; and I have her welfare at heart, as, I suppose, you\u0027ll believe. I don\u0027t know who should have, if it isn\u0027t me!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Brother Maxfield,\" said the preacher, earnestly, \"are you sure that you have a clear leading in this matter? Have you prayed for one?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Maxfield shifted in his chair, and made no answer. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, consider what you do in trusting that tender soul among worldlings! I do not say that these are wicked people in a carnal sense; but are they such as can edify or strengthen a young girl like Rhoda, who is still in a seeking state, and has not yet that blessed assurance which we all supplicate for her?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I have laid the matter before the Lord,\" said Maxfield, almost sullenly. \\n\\n \\n\\n Powell was silent for a minute, standing with his hands forcibly clasped together, as though to control them from vehement action, and when next he spoke, his voice had a tone in it which told of a strong effort of will to keep it in subdued monotony. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then, have you thought of it?\" said he; \"there is the young man Algernon.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What of Algernon?\" cried Maxfield, turning sharply to face the preacher. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He is fair to look upon, and specious, and has those graces and talents which the world accounts lovely. May there not be a snare here for Rhoda? She who is so alive to all beauty and graciousness in God\u0027s world, and in God\u0027s creatures—may it not be very perilous for her to be thrown unguardedly into the society of this youth?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Maxfield looked into the fire instead of at Powell, as he said, \"What has been putting this into your head?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I have had a call to say it to you, for some time past. Before I went away this summer it was on my mind. I sinned in resisting the call, for—for reasons which matter to no one but myself. I sinned in putting any human reasons above my Master\u0027s service.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It may be as you would have done better to resist speaking now,\" said Maxfield, slowly. \"It may be as it was rather a temptation, than a leading from Heaven, made you speak at all.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Powell started back as if he had been struck. The blood rushed into his face, and then, suddenly receding, left him paler than before. But he answered after a moment in a low, sweet voice, and without a trace of anger, \"You cannot mistrust me more than I mistrusted myself. But I have wrestled and prayed; and I am assured that I have spoken this thing with a single heart.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, well, well, it may be as you say,\" said Maxfield, a shade less harshly than he had spoken before. \"But you have neither wife, nor daughter, nor sister, and you cannot understand these matters as well as I do, who am more than double your years, and have had the guidance of this young maid from a baby upward.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Nay,\" answered Powell, humbly; \"it is not my own wisdom I am uttering! God forbid that I should set up my carnal judgment against a man of your years.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s very well said—very rightly said!\" exclaimed Maxfield, nodding twice or thrice. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Aye, but I must speak when my conscience bids me. I dare not resist that admonition for any human respect.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why, to be sure! But do you think yours is the only conscience to be listened to? I tell you I follow mine, young man. And you can ask any of our brethren here in Whitford, who have known me for the last thirty or forty years, whether I have gone far astray!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Powell sighed wearily. \"I have released my soul,\" he said. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And just hearken,\" pursued old Maxfield, in a lowered voice, \"don\u0027t say a word of this sort to Rhoda—nay, don\u0027t interrupt me! I\u0027ve listened to your say, now let me have mine—because you might be putting something into her thoughts that wouldn\u0027t have come there of itself. And keep a discreet tongue before Betty and James. \u0027Least said, soonest mended.\u0027 And I\u0027ll tell you something more. If—observe I say \u0027if\u0027—I saw that Rhoda\u0027s heart was strongly set upon anything, anything as wasn\u0027t wrong in itself, I should be very loath to thwart her.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n David Powell turned a startled, attentive face on the old man, who proceeded with a sort of dogged monotony of voice and manner: \"Christian charity teaches us there\u0027s good folks in all communions of believers. And there\u0027s different ranks and different orders in the world; some has one thing, and some has another. Some has fine family and great connections among the rulers of the land. Others has the goods of this world earned by honesty, and diligence, and frugality; and these three bring a blessing. Some is fitted to be gentlefolks by nature, let \u0027em be born where they will. Others, like my sister-in-law Betty, is born to serve. We are all the Lord\u0027s creatures, and we are in his hand but as clay in the hands of the potter. But there\u0027s different kinds of clay, you know. This kind is good for making coarse delf, and that kind is fit for fine porcelain. We\u0027ll just keep these words as have passed between you and me, to ourselves, if you please. And now, I I think, we may drop the subject.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"May the Lord give you his counsel!\" said Powell, in a broken voice. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Amen! I have had my share of wisdom, and have walked pretty straight for the last half century, thanks be to Him,\" observed old Max, drily. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If it were His good pleasure, how gladly would I cease for evermore from speaking to you on this theme! But it matters nothing what I desire or shrink from. I must deliver my Master\u0027s message when it is borne in upon me to do so.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And with a solemnly uttered blessing on the household, the preacher departed. \\n\\n \\n\\n The master of the house sat thinking, alone by his fireside. He began by thinking that he had a little over-encouraged David Powell. Maxfield considered praise from himself to be very encouraging, and calculated to uplift the heart. When Powell had first come among the Whitford Methodists, old Max had taken him by the hand, and had declared him to be the most awakening preacher they had had for many years.
