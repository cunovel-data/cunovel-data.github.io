{"id":21618,"no":16,"title":"CHAPTER XVI.","content":"Arrived in London, with an influential patron ready to receive him, and twenty pounds in his pocket, over and above the sum his mother had contrived to spare out of her quarter\u0027s income, Algernon Errington considered himself to be a very lucky fellow. He had good health, good spirits, good looks, and a disposition to make the most of them, untrammelled by shyness or scruples. \n \n He did feel a little nervous as he drove, the day after his arrival in town, to Lord Seely\u0027s house, but by no means painfully so. He was undeniably anxious to make a good impression. But his experience, so far, led him to assume, almost with certainty, that he should succeed in doing so. \n \n The hackney-coach stopped at the door of a grimy-looking mansion in Mayfair, but it was a stately mansion withal. In reply to Algernon\u0027s inquiry whether Lord Seely was at home, a solemn servant said that his lordship was at home, but was usually engaged at that hour. \"Will you carry in my card to him?\" said Algernon. \"Mr. Ancram Errington.\" \n \n Algy felt that he had made a false move in coming without any previous announcement, and in dismissing his cab, when he was shown into a little closet off the hall, lined with dingy books, and containing only two hard horsehair chairs, to await the servant\u0027s return. There was something a little flat and ignominious in this his first appearance in the Seely house, waiting like a dun or an errand-boy, with the possibility of having to walk out again, without having been admitted to the light of my lord\u0027s countenance. However, within a reasonable time, the solemn footman returned, and asked him to walk upstairs, as my lady would receive him, although my lord was for the present engaged. \n \n Algernon followed the man up a softly-carpeted staircase, and through one or two handsome drawing-rooms—a little dim from the narrowness of the street and the heaviness of the curtains—into a small cosy boudoir. There was a good fire on the hearth, and in an easy-chair on one side of it sat a fat lady, with a fat lap-dog on her knees. The lady, as soon as she saw Algernon, waved a jewelled hand to keep him off, and said, in a mellow, pleasant voice, which reminded him of his mother\u0027s, \"How d\u0027ye do? Don\u0027t shake hands, nor come too near, because Fido don\u0027t like it, and he bites strangers if he sees them touch me. Sit down.\" \n \n Algernon had made a very agile backward movement on the announcement of Fido\u0027s infirmity of temper; but he bowed, smiled, and seated himself at a respectful distance opposite to my lady. Lady Seely\u0027s appearance certainly justified Mrs. Errington\u0027s frequent assertion that there was a strong family likeness throughout all branches of the Ancram stock, for she bore a considerable resemblance to Mrs. Errington herself, and a still stronger resemblance to a miniature of Mrs. Errington\u0027s grandfather, which Algy had often seen. My lady was some ten years older than Mrs. Errington. She wore a blonde wig, and was rouged. But her wig and her rouge belonged to the candid and ingenuous species of embellishment. Each proclaimed aloud, as it were, \"I am wig!\" \"I am paint!\" with scarcely an attempt at deception. \n \n \"So you\u0027ve come to town,\" said my lady, fumbling for her eye-glass with one hand, while with the other she patted and soothed the growling Fido. Having found the eye-glass, she looked steadily through it at Algernon, who bore the scrutiny with a good-humoured smile and a little blush, which became him very well. \n \n \"You\u0027re very nice-looking, indeed,\" said my lady. \n \n Algy could not find a suitable reply to this speech, so he only smiled still more, and made a half-jesting little bow. \n \n \"Let me see,\" pursued Lady Seely, still holding her glass to her eyes, \"what is our exact relationship? You are a relation of mine, you know.\" \n \n \"I am glad to say I have that honour.\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t suppose you know much of the family genealogy,\" said my lady, who prided herself on her own accurate knowledge of such matters. \"My grandfather and your mother\u0027s grandfather were brothers. Your mother\u0027s grandfather was the elder brother. He had a very pretty estate in Warwickshire, and squandered it all in less than twelve years. I don\u0027t suppose your mother\u0027s father had a penny to bless himself with when he came of age.\" \n \n \"I daresay not, ma\u0027am.\" \n \n \"My grandfather did better. He went to India when he was seventeen, and came back when he was seventy, with a pot of money. Ah, if my father hadn\u0027t been the youngest of five brothers, I should have been a rich woman!\" \n \n \"Your ladyship\u0027s grandfather was General Cloudesley Ancram, who distinguished himself at the siege of Khallaka,\" said Algernon. \n \n Lady Seely nodded approvingly. \"Ah, your mother has taught you that, has she?\" she said. \"And what was your father? Wasn\u0027t he an apothecary?\" \n \n Algernon\u0027s face showed no trace of annoyance, except a little increase of colour in his blooming young cheeks, as he answered, \"The fact is, Lady Seely, that my poor father was an enthusiast about science. He would study medicine, instead of going into the Church, and availing himself of the family interest. The consequence was, that he died a poor M.D. instead of a rich D.D.—or even, who knows? a bishop!\" \n \n \"La!\" said my lady, shortly. Then, after a minute\u0027s pause, she added, \"Then, I suppose, you\u0027re not very rich, hey?\" \n \n \"I am as poor, ma\u0027am, as my grandfather, Montagu Ancram, of whom your ladyship was saying just now that he had not a penny to bless himself with when he came of age,\" returned Algernon, laughing. \n \n \"Well, you seem to take it very easy,\" said my lady. And once more she looked at him through her eye-glass. \"And what made you come to town, all the way from what-d\u0027ye-call-it? Have you got anything to do?\" \n \n \"N—nothing definite, exactly,\" said Algernon. \n \n \"H\u0027m! Quiet, Fido!\" \n \n \"I ventured to hope that Lord Seely—that perhaps my lord—might——\" \n \n \"Oh, dear, you mustn\u0027t run away with that idea!\" exclaimed her ladyship. \"There ain\u0027t the least chance of my lord being able to do anything for you. He\u0027s torn to pieces by people wanting places, and all sorts of things.\" \n \n \"I was about to say that I ventured to hope that my lord would kindly give me some advice,\" said Algernon. As he said it his heart was like lead. He had not, of course, expected to be at once made Secretary of State, or even to pop immediately into a clerkship at the Foreign Office. He had put the matter very soberly and moderately before his own mind, as he thought. He had told himself that a word of encouragement from his high and mighty cousin should be thankfully received, and that he would neither be pushing nor impatient, accepting a very small beginning cheerfully. But it had never occurred to him to prepare himself for an absolute flat refusal of all assistance. My lady\u0027s tone was one of complete decision. And it was in vain he reflected that my lady might be speaking more harshly and decisively than she had any warrant for doing, being led to that course by the necessity of protecting herself and her husband against importunity. None the less was his heart very heavy within him. And he really deserved some credit for gallantry in bearing up against the blow. \n \n \"Advice!\" said my lady, echoing his word. \"Oh, well, that ain\u0027t so difficult. What are you fit for?\" \n \n \"Perhaps I am scarcely the best judge of that, am I?\" returned Algernon, with that childlike raising of the eyebrows which gave so winning an expression to his face. \n \n \"Perhaps not; but what do you think?\" \n \n \"Well, I—I believe I could fill the post of secretary, or——What I should like,\" he went on, in a sudden burst of candour, and looking deprecatingly at Lady Seely, like a child asking for sugar-plums, \"would be to get attached to one of our foreign legations.\" \n \n \"I daresay! But that\u0027s easier said than done. And as to being a secretary, it\u0027s precious hard work, I can tell you, if you\u0027re paid for it; and, of course, no post would suit you that didn\u0027t pay.\" \n \n \"I shouldn\u0027t mind hard work.\" \n \n \"You wouldn\u0027t be much of an Ancram if you liked it; I can tell you I know that much! Well, and how long do you mean to stay in town?\" \n \n \"That is quite uncertain.\" \n \n \"You must come and see me again before you go, and be introduced to Lord Seely.\" \n \n \"Oh, indeed, I hope so.\" \n \n Come and see her again before he went! What would his mother say, what would his Whitford friends say, if they could hear that speech? Nevertheless, he answered very cheerfully: \n \n \"Oh, indeed, I hope so!\" And interpreting my lady\u0027s words as a dismissal, rose to go. \n \n \"You\u0027re really uncommonly nice-looking,\" said Lady Seely, observing his straight, slight figure, and his neatly-shod feet as he stood before her. \"Oh, you needn\u0027t look shame-faced about it. It\u0027s no merit of yours; but it\u0027s a great thing, let me tell you, for a young fellow without a penny to have an agreeable appearance. How old are you?\" \n \n \"Twenty,\" said Algernon, anticipating his birthday by two months. \n \n \"Do you know, I think Fido will like you!\" said my lady, who observed the fact that her favourite had neither barked nor growled when Algernon rose from his chair. \"I\u0027m sure I hope he will; he is so unpleasant when he takes a dislike to people.\" \n \n Algernon thought so too; but he merely said, \"Oh, we shall be great friends, I daresay; I always get on with dogs.\" \n \n \"Ah, but Fido is peculiar. You can\u0027t coax him and he gets so much to eat that you can\u0027t bribe him. If he likes you, he likes you—voilà tout! By-the-way, do you understand French?\" \n \n \"Yes; pretty fairly. I like it.\" \n \n \"Do you? But, as to your accent—I\u0027m afraid that cannot be much to boast of. English provincial French is always so very dreadful.\" \n \n \"Well, I don\u0027t know,\" said Algernon, with perfect good humour, for he believed himself to be on safe ground here; \"but the old Duc de Villegagnon, an émigré, who was my master, used to say that I did not pronounce the words of my little French songs so badly.\" \n \n \"Bless the boy! Can you sing French songs? Do sit down, then, at the piano, and let me hear one! Never mind Fido.\" (Her ladyship had set her favourite on the floor, and he was sniffing at Algernon\u0027s legs.) \"He don\u0027t dislike music, except a brass band. Sit down, now!\" \n \n Algernon obeyed, seated himself at the pianoforte, and began to run his fingers over the keys. He found the instrument a good deal out of tune; but began, after a minute\u0027s pause, a forgotten chansonette, from \"Le Petit Chaperon Rouge.\" He sang with taste and spirit, though little voice; and his French accent proved to be so surprisingly good, as to elicit unqualified approbation from Lady Seely. \n \n \"Why, I declare that\u0027s charming!\" she cried, clapping her hands. \"How on earth did you pick up all that in—what\u0027s-its-name? Do look here, my lord, here\u0027s young Ancram come up from that place in the West of England, and he can play the piano and sing French songs delightfully!\" \n \n Algernon jumped up in a little flurry, and, turning round, found himself face to face with his magnificent relative, Lord Seely. \n \n Now it must be owned that \"magnificent\" was not quite the epithet that could justly be applied to Lord Seely\u0027s personal appearance. He was a small, delicately-made man, with a small, delicately-featured face, and sharp, restless dark eyes. His grey hair stood up in two tufts, one above each ear, and the top of his head was bald, shining, and yellowish, like old ivory. \"Eh?\" said he. \"Oh! Mr.—a—a, how d\u0027ye do?\" Then he shook hands with Algernon, and courteously motioning him to resume his seat, threw himself into a chair by the hearth, opposite to his wife. He stretched out his short legs to their utmost possible length before him, and leant his head back wearily. \n \n \"Tired, my lord?\" asked his wife. \n \n \"Why, yes, a little. Dictating letters is a fatiguing business, Mr.—a—a—\" \n \n \"Errington, my lord; Ancram Errington.\" \n \n \"Oh, to be sure! I\u0027m very glad to see you; very glad indeed. Yes, yes; Mr. Errington. You are a cousin of my lady\u0027s? Of course. Very glad.\" \n \n And Lord Seely got up and shook hands once more with Algernon, whose identity he had evidently only just recognised. But, although tardy, the peer\u0027s greeting was more than civil, it was kind; and Algernon\u0027s gratitude was in direct proportion to the chill disappointment he had felt at Lady Seely\u0027s discouraging words. \n \n \"Thank you, sir,\" he said, pressing the small thin white hand that was proffered to him. And Algy\u0027s way of saying \"Thank you, sir,\" was admirable, and would have made the fortune of a young actor on the stage; for, in saying it, he had sufficient real emotion to make the simulated emotion quite touching—as an actor should have. \n \n My lord sat down again, wearily. \"Bush has been with me again about that emigration scheme of his,\" he said to his wife. \"Upon my honour, I don\u0027t know a more trying person than Bush.\" When he had thus spoken, he cast his eyes once more upon Algernon, who said, in the most artless, impulsive way in the world, \"It\u0027s a poor-spirited kind of thing, no doubt; but, really, when one sees what a hard time of it statesmen have, one can\u0027t help feeling sometimes that it is pleasant to be nobody.\" \n \n Now the word \"statesman\" applied to Lord Seely was scarcely more correct than the word \"magnificent\" applied to his outer man. The fact was, that Lord Seely had been, from his youth upward, ambitious of political distinction, and had, indeed, filled a subordinate post in the Cabinet some twenty years previous to the day on which Algernon first made his acquaintance. But he had been a mere cypher there; and the worst of it was, that he had been conscious of being a cypher. He had not strength of character or ability to dominate other men, and he had too much intelligence to flatter himself that he succeeded, where success had eluded his pursuit. Stupider men had done better for themselves in the world than Valentine Sackville Strong, Lord Seely, and had gained more solid slices of success than he. Perhaps there is nothing more detrimental to the achievement of ascendancy over others than that intermittent kind of intellect, which is easily blown into a flame by vanity, but is as easily cooled down again by the chilly suggestions of common sense. The vanity which should be able to maintain itself always at white heat would be a triumphant thing. The common sense which never flared up to an enthusiastic temperature would be a safe thing. But the alternation of the two was felt to be uncomfortable and disconcerting by all who had much to do with Lord Seely. He continued, however, to keep up a semblance of political life. He had many personal friends in the present ministry, and there were one or two men who were rather specially hostile to him among the Opposition; of which latter he was very proud, liking to speak of his \"enemies\" in the House. He spoke pretty frequently from his place among the peers, but nobody paid him any particular attention. And he wrote and printed, at his own expense, a considerable number of political pamphlets; but nobody read them. That, however, may have been due to the combination against his lordship which existed among the writers for the public press, who never, he complained, reported his speeches in extenso, and, with few exceptions, ignored his pamphlets altogether. \n \n Howbeit, the word \"statesman\" struck pleasantly upon the little nobleman\u0027s ear, and he bestowed a more attentive glance on Algernon than he had hitherto honoured him with, and asked, in his abrupt tones, like a series of muffled barks, \"Going to be long in town, Mr. Ancram?\" \n \n \"I\u0027ve just been asking him,\" interposed my lady. \"He don\u0027t know for certain. But——\" And here she whispered in her husband\u0027s ear. \n \n \"Oh, I hope so,\" said the latter aloud. \"My lady and I hope that you will do us the favour to dine with us to-morrow—eh? Oh, I beg your pardon, Belinda, I thought you said to-morrow!—on Thursday next. We shall probably be alone, but I hope you will not mind that?\" \n \n \"I shall take it as a great favour, my lord,\" said Algernon, whose spirits had been steadily rising, ever since the successful performance of his French song. \n \n \"You know, Mr. Ancram—I mean Mr. Errington—is a cousin of mine, my lord; so he won\u0027t expect to be treated with ceremony.\" \n \n Algernon felt as if he could have flown downstairs when, after this most gracious speech, he took leave of his august relatives. But he walked very soberly instead, down the staircase and past the solemn servants in the hall, with as much nonchalance as if he had been accustomed to the service of powdered lackeys from his babyhood. \n \n \"He seems an intelligent, gentleman-like young fellow,\" said my lord to my lady. \n \n \"Oh, he\u0027s as sharp as a weasel, and uncommonly nice-looking. And he sings French songs ever so much better than that theatre man that the Duchess made such a fuss about. He has the trick of drawing the long bow, which all the Warwickshire Ancrams were famous for. Oh, there\u0027s no doubt about his belonging to the real breed! He told me a cock-and-a-bull story about his father\u0027s devotion to science. I believe his father was a little apothecary in Birmingham. But I don\u0027t know that that much matters,\" said my lady to my lord. \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2168/61277.html","bookId":444,"book":{"id":444,"title":"A Charming Fellow","description":"简介： The room was very quiet.
