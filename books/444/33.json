{"id":21635,"no":33,"title":"CHAPTER XIV.","content":"Among the first persons to hear of David Powell\u0027s return to Whitford, and his intention of preaching there, was Miss Bodkin. As the spectators see more of the play than the actors, so Minnie, from her couch or her lounging-chair, witnessed many a scene in its entirety, which those who performed it were only conscious of in a fragmentary manner. The news of the little town was brought to her through many various channels. Her infirmity seemed to set her in a place apart, and many a one was willing to play the part of Chorus for her behoof, and interpret the drama after his or her own fashion. Minnie\u0027s maid, Jane Gibbs; Mrs. Errington; and Mr. Diamond, had all given her the news about Mr. Powell; and all in different keys, and with such variations of detail as universally attend contemporaneous viva voce transmissions. Jane Gibbs had a strong feeling of respect and gratitude towards the preacher for his having \"converted\" her brother. And, being herself a member of the Church of England, she looked upon his secession from the main body of the Methodists with great leniency. She dared to say that Mr. Powell would do as much good in Lady Lane as he had done in the Wesleyan Chapel. And seeing that whether you called \u0027em Wesleyans, or Ranters, or Baptists, or Quakers, or Calvinists, they were all Dissenters, it could not so much matter whether they disagreed among each other or not. Mrs. Errington, without entering into that question, considered herself peculiarly aggrieved by the circumstance that Powell had come to lodge in the same house with her. \"I am doomed, it seems, to be a victim to that man!\" said she to Minnie Bodkin. \"At Maxfield\u0027s house I was frequently disturbed by his hymns and his preachments; and even now, it appears, I am not to escape from him. He absorbs Mrs. Thimbleby\u0027s attention to a ludicrous extent. If you will credit the fact, my dear Minnie, only yesterday morning my egg was sent up at breakfast greatly over-boiled; and when I remonstrated with Mrs. Thimbleby on this piece of negligence, what excuse do you suppose she made? She answered that she was very sorry, but she had been getting ready a \u0027little snack\u0027—that was her expression—for Mr. Powell after his early preaching, and it had slipped her memory that my breakfast-egg was still in the saucepan! I have no doubt the man stuffs and crams himself at her cost. All these dissenting preachers do, my dear.\" Whereunto Minnie answered gravely, that it was a great comfort to Church people to reflect that moderation in eating and drinking was entirely confined to the orthodox clergy. Mr. Diamond, again, took a different and more sympathising view of the poor preacher. But even he was very far from entertaining the same exalted admiration for Powell\u0027s character as was felt by Minnie. Matthew Diamond had an Englishman\u0027s ingrained antipathy to the uncontrolled display of feeling, from which Powell\u0027s Welsh blood by no means revolted. Diamond could never divest himself of a lurking notion that no man would publicly exhibit deep emotion if he could help it; and consequently he looked on all such exhibitions as rather pitiable manifestations of infirmity, or else as mere clap-trap and play-acting. Of the latter it was impossible to suspect Powell. Diamond had the touchstone of truthfulness within himself; and it sufficed to convince him that the preacher, however wild and mistaken, was sincere. \"Yes,\" he said to Miss Bodkin, \"there can be no doubt that the man\u0027s soul is as clear from guile as an infant\u0027s. But it is a pity he cannot suppress the outbursts of enthusiasm which exhaust him so much.\" \"He does not wish to suppress them,\" answered Minnie. \"He looks on them as a means specially vouchsafed to him for moving others, and—to use his own words—saving souls. Some sober, sensible persons remind me, when they speak of David Powell, of a covey of barn-door fowls, complacently staring up at a lark, and exclaiming, \u0027Poor creature, how unpleasant it must be for it to have to soar and gyrate in that giddy fashion; and making that shrill noise all the time, too! How it must envy us our constitutions!\u0027\" \"I suppose I am one of the barn-door fowls, Miss Bodkin?\" \"Well—perhaps! Or, rather, you have lived among them until it seems to you that higher-flying creatures have something a little ridiculous about them. And you forcibly restrain any upward tendencies of wing—at least in the presence of your mates of the barn-door.\" \"I am flattered to be credited with some upward tendencies, at any rate! But, Miss Bodkin, to drop metaphor, in which I cannot attempt to compete with you, I must be allowed to maintain that Powell\u0027s outbursts of excitement are neither good for himself nor others. They are morbid, and not the healthy expression of a healthy nature, like the lark\u0027s singing and soaring.\" \"You have seen Powell since his return. How does he seem to be in health?\" \"In bodily health not, perhaps, so much amiss, although he is greatly emaciated and startlingly pale. But his mind is in a strange state.\" \"He was always enthusiastic.\" \"He is enthusiastic for others, but as regards himself his mind is a prey to overwhelming gloom. I see a great change for the worse in him in that respect.\" Minnie felt a strong desire to see the preacher again. She compassionated him from her heart, and thought she might be able to administer some comfort to him, as regarded Rhoda Maxfield. There were days when Minnie was able to walk from one room to another with the assistance of a crutched stick; and it occurred to her that if Mrs. Thimbleby would allow her house to be made the place of meeting, she might see and speak with Powell there more privately, and with less danger of exciting gossiping remark, than elsewhere. Minnie had once or twice latterly driven to the widow Thimbleby\u0027s house to see Mrs. Errington, or leave a message for her, although she had never mounted to her sitting-room. For the ladder-like staircase, which was an imaginary difficulty in the way of Castalia\u0027s visits to her mother-in-law, was a very real obstacle to Minnie Bodkin. The project of seeing Powell in this way took possession of her mind. She sent a note to Mrs. Thimbleby, by her maid Jane, asking at what hour Mr. Powell was most likely to be in the house; and saying that she should like to come there and say a few words to him about a person in whose welfare he was interested. The widow saw nothing very singular in this. She knew that Powell had been to see Miss Bodkin before he left Whitford. And it was quite in accordance with the known characters of the Methodist preacher and the rector\u0027s daughter that they should meet and combine on the common ground of charity. \"For sure Mr. Powell have recommended some poor afflicted person to the young lady, and she have assisted \u0027em, whosoever they may be!\" thought Mrs. Thimbleby. \"And she begs me not to mention her coming to anybody. For sure and certain she\u0027s not one o\u0027 them as boasts of their good deeds. No, no; like our blessed Mr. Powell, she don\u0027t let her left hand know what her right hand doeth. I wonder if she\u0027s under conviction! Such a good, charitable lady, it seems as if she must belong to the elect. But, there, all our good works are filthy rags, I s\u0027pose, the best on us. But I can\u0027t help thinking as Miss Bodkin\u0027s works must be more pleasing to the Lord than Brother Jackson\u0027s, as lives among the Wesleyans on the fat of the land, and don\u0027t do much in return, except condemning all those folks as isn\u0027t Wesleyans. Lord forgive me if I\u0027m wrong!\" Mrs. Thimbleby returned a verbal message to Miss Bodkin, as the latter had desired her to do: Mrs. Thimbleby\u0027s duty, and the most likely time would be between four and five o\u0027clock in the afternoon; and she would be sure to obey Miss Bodkin\u0027s instructions. \"And I\u0027m ever so much obliged to her for excusing me writing, my dear,\" said the widow to Jane; \"for my hands is so stiff and rough with hard work, as holding a pen seems to be a great difficulty. I\u0027d far rather mop out my back yard any day than write the receipt for the lodgers\u0027 rent. And \u0027tis but a smudgy business when all\u0027s done.\" On the following day Dr. Bodkin\u0027s sober green carriage, drawn by a stout, sober-paced horse, was seen standing at Mrs. Thimbleby\u0027s door. It was a few minutes after four o\u0027clock in the afternoon. The street was very quiet. There was scarcely a passer-by to be seen from one end of it to the other, when Jane and the old man-servant assisted Miss Bodkin to alight from the carriage, and supported her into the clean, flagged room on the ground floor, which served Mrs. Thimbleby for parlour, kitchen, and dining-hall, all in one. The coachman had orders to return and fetch his young mistress at six o\u0027clock. \"Will you give me house-room so long, Mrs. Thimbleby?\" asked Minnie with a sweet smile, which so captivated the good woman that she stood staring at her visitor in a kind of rapture, unable to reply for a minute or two. Minnie was placed in Mrs. Thimbleby\u0027s own high-backed chair, with the clean patchwork-covered cushions piled behind her. A horsehair footstool, borrowed for the purpose from Mr. Diamond\u0027s parlour, was under her feet. And she declared that she found herself as comfortable as in her own lounging-chair at home. \"You see, miss, I couldn\u0027t say to the minute when Mr. Powell would be back, but between four and five he generally do come in, and I make him swallow a cup of herb tea, or something. And I will not deny that I sometimes puts a pinch of China tea in. But he don\u0027t know. This is but a poor place, miss,\" added the widow, glancing round, \"but so long as you can make yourself content to stay in it, so long you will be welcome as the flowers in May, if \u0027twas to be for a twelvemonth?\" Then Minnie praised the brilliant cleanliness of the little kitchen, took notice of the cat that rubbed its velvet head confidingly against her hand, and asked Mrs. Thimbleby how she prospered in her lodging-letting. The widow was loquacious in her mild slow way; and she was pleased at this opportunity for a little harmless gossip. It was a propensity which received frequent checks from those around her. Mr. Diamond was too taciturn, too grave, too much absorbed in his books, to give any heed to his landlady\u0027s conversation, beyond listening to the few particulars of his weekly expenses, which she insisted on explaining to him. Mrs. Errington, on the other hand, was not at all taciturn, but she desired to have the talk chiefly to herself. She loved to harangue Mrs. Thimbleby on a variety of subjects, and to place, in vivid colours before her, the inadequacy of all her domestic arrangements to satisfy a lady of Mrs. Errington\u0027s quality. As to gossiping with David Powell, Mrs. Thimbleby would as soon have thought of attempting to gossip with the sculptured figure of a saint, which stood in a niche at one side of the portal of St. Chad\u0027s! So the good woman, finding Miss Bodkin more compliant and affable than the two first-named of her lodgers, and nearer to the level of common humanity than the last, indulged herself with an outpouring of chat, as the two sat waiting for Powell\u0027s return. Minnie listened to her at first with but a drowsy kind of attention. Her own thoughts were wandering away from the present time and place. And, for a while, the quiet of the room, where the gathering twilight seemed to bring a deeper hush, was only broken by the monotonous murmur of the widow\u0027s voice. But by-and-by Mrs. Thimbleby spoke words which effectually aroused Minnie\u0027s attention. There was, she said, a deal of talk in Whitford about young Mr. Errington. He was such a very nice-spoken gentleman, and most people seemed to like him so much! But yet he had enemies in the town. Folks said he was extravagant. And his wife gave herself such airs as there was no bearing with \u0027em; she not paying ready money, but almost expecting tradespeople to be satisfied with the honour of serving her. Poor lady, she wasn\u0027t used to be pinched for money herself, and knew no better, most likely! But many Whitford shopkeepers grumbled as Mr. Errington got goods on credit from them, and yet sent orders to London with ready money for expensive articles, and it didn\u0027t seem fair. There was no use saying anything to old Mrs. Errington about the matter, because, though she was, no doubt, a very good-hearted lady, she was rather \"high.\" And if you mentioned to her, as Mr. Gladwish, the shoemaker, said, unpleasant things about her son\u0027s bill, why she would tell you that her grandfather drove four horses to his coach, and that Mr. Algernon\u0027s wife\u0027s uncle was a great nobleman up in London, as paid his butler a bigger salary than all Gladwish could earn in a year. And if such sayings got abroad, they would not be soothing to the feelings of a respectable shoemaker, would they now? Not to say that they wouldn\u0027t help to pay Gladwish\u0027s bill; nor yet the fly bill at the \"Blue Bell;\" nor yet the bill for young madam at Ravell and Sarsnet\u0027s; nor yet the bill at the fishmonger and poulterer\u0027s; as she (Mrs. Thimbleby) was credibly informed that Ivy Lodge consumed the best of everything, and at a great rate. In the beginning, tradespeople believed all that was said about young Mr. and Mrs. Errington\u0027s fine friends and fine prospects, and seemed inclined to trust \u0027em to any amount. But latterly there had growed up a feeling against \u0027em. And—if Miss Bodkin wouldn\u0027t think it a liberty in her to ask her not to mention it again, seeing it was but a guess on her part—she would go so far as to say that she believed an enemy was at work, and that enemy old Jonathan Maxfield. Why or wherefore old Max should be so set against young Mr. Algernon, as he had known him from a little child, she could not say. But there was rumours about that young Errington owed old Max money. And old Max was that near and fond of his pelf, as nothing was so likely to make him mad against any one as losing money by \u0027em; and old Max was a harsh man and a bitter where he took a dislike. Only see how he had persecuted Mr. Powell! And though he let his daughter go to Ivy Lodge—and they did say young Mrs. Errington had taken quite a fancy to the girl—yet that didn\u0027t prevent old Max sneering and snarling, and saying all manner of sharp words against the Erringtons. And old Max was a man of substance, and his words had weight in the town. \"And you see, miss,\" said Mrs. Thimbleby, in conclusion, \"young Mr. and Mrs. Errington are gentlefolks, and they don\u0027t hear what\u0027s said in Whitford, and they may think things are all right when they\u0027re all wrong. Of course, I daresay they have great friends and good prospects, miss. And very likely they could settle everything to-morrow if they thought fit. Only the tale here is, that not a tradesman in the place has seen the colour of their money, and they deny theirselves nothing, and the lady so high in her manners, and altogether there is a feeling against \u0027em, miss. And as I know you\u0027re a old friend, and a kind friend, I\u0027m sure, and not one as takes pleasure in the troubles of their neighbours, I thought I would mention it to you, in case you should like to say a word to the young lady and gentleman private-like. A word from you would have a deal of weight. And I do assure you, miss, \u0027tis of no use trying to speak to old Mrs. Errington, for she\u0027ll only go on about her grandfather\u0027s coach-and-four; and, between you and me, miss, there is some as takes it amiss.\" All this pained and surprised Minnie. She understood at once how Castalia\u0027s ungracious manner was resented in the little town; and set down a great deal of the hostility which the widow had described to the score of the Honourable Mrs. Algernon\u0027s personal unpopularity. Still there must be something seriously wrong at Ivy Lodge. Debt was a Slough of Despond into which such a one as Algernon Errington would easily put his foot, from sheer thoughtlessness and the habit of refusing himself no gratification within his reach. But he might not find it so easy to extricate himself. A word of warning might possibly do good. At least it could do no harm, beyond drawing forth some languid impertinence from Castalia. And Minnie would not for an instant weigh that chance against the hope of doing some good to her old friend Algy. Besides, in truth, she had, as has been said, an undefined feeling of compassion for Castalia herself, which rendered her singularly forbearing towards the latter\u0027s manifestations of fretful jealousy or haughty dislike. In the first days of his return to Whitford Algernon had many a time shot one of his quick, questioning glances at Minnie, when his wife uttered some coolly insolent speech, directed at, rather than to, the rector\u0027s daughter. But instead of the keen sarcasm, or scornful irony, which he had expected, Minnie had, nine times out of ten, replied with a quiet matter-of-fact observation calculated to extinguish anything like a war of words. At first Algernon had attributed such forbearance on the part of the brilliant, high-spirited Minnie entirely to her strong regard for himself. But this flattering illusion did not last long. He soon perceived that Minnie regarded his wife with pity, and that she refrained from using the keen weapons of her wit against Castalia, much as a nurse might refrain from scolding or arguing with a sick child. Now this discovery was not pleasant to Algernon. If any sympathy were to be expended on the inmates of Ivy Lodge, he was persuaded that much the larger share of it ought to be given to himself. If there were troubles; if there were mortifications; if there was disappointment—who suffered from them as he did? And by whom were they so unmerited? He was not far, sometimes, from resenting any show of compassion for Castalia as a direct injury to himself. After having sacrificed himself, by making a marriage so inadequate to his deserts, it was a little too much to hear his wife pitied for the contrast between her past and present position? And yet, by a queer strain of inconsistency running through the warp and woof of his character, he would often boast of Castalia\u0027s aristocratic antecedents, and ask, with a smile and a shrug, how the deuce his wife could be expected to stand the petty privations and discomforts of Whitford, after having lived all her life in a sphere as remote from such things as the planet Saturn from the earth? Minnie partly saw, partly guessed, these movements of Algernon\u0027s mind. But she judged him with leniency, and put a kind interpretation on his words and ways, whenever such an interpretation was possible. At all events, if a word in season could be useful to him, she would not refrain from speaking that word. This young woman had latterly passed into regions of thought and feeling, from which much of her old life, with its old pains, and pleasures, and aims, seemed shrunken into insignificance. One solid good she was able to grasp and to enjoy; the satisfaction of serving her fellow-creatures. All else grew poor and paltry as the years rolled by. Not that Minnie had attained to any saint-like heights of self-abnegation; not that she did not still \"desire and admire\" many sublunary things. But she had got a hurt that had stricken down her pride. She bore an ache in her heart for which \"self-culture,\" and all the activities and aspirations of her bright intellect, afforded no balm. But she did not grow sour and selfish in her grief. The example of the poor, unlettered Methodist preacher (whom in former days she would have thought the unlikeliest of human beings to teach her any profitable lesson) had roused the noblest part of her nature to emulation. David Powell had started from a lofty theory to a life of beautiful deeds. Minnie Bodkin, vaguely groping after a theory, had seized on practical benevolence as a means to climb to some higher ideal. In morals, as in thought, the Deductive and Inductive stand, like the ladders of Jacob\u0027s dream, reaching from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven; and the angels of the Lord descend and ascend them continually. Minnie was roused from a reverie by the entrance of the preacher\u0027s tall figure into the kitchen, where the fire was now beginning to throw ruddy lights and fantastic shadows on to the white-washed walls. \"Don\u0027t be startled, Mr. Powell,\" she said, in her clear, sweet tones. \"It is I—Minnie Bodkin. I thought I should like to see you, and to say a few words to you, quietly.\" Powell advanced, and took her outstretched hand reverently in his hand. \"The blessing of our Father in Heaven be on you, lady,\" he said. \"Your kind face is very welcome to me.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2168/61294.html","bookId":444,"book":{"id":444,"title":"A Charming Fellow","description":"简介： The room was very quiet.
