{"id":21656,"no":54,"title":"CHAPTER XVIII.","content":"Algernon\u0027s state of mind during his return journey to Whitford was very much pleasanter than it had been on his way up to town. To be sure, he had committed himself distinctly to a very grave statement. That was always disagreeable. But then he had made an immense impression on Lord Seely by his statement. He had crushed and overwhelmed that \"pompous little ass.\" He had humiliated that \"absurd little upstart.\" And—best of all; for these others were mere dilettante pleasures, which no man of intelligence would indulge in at the cost of his solid interests—he had terrified him so completely with the spectre of a public scandal and disgrace, that my lord was ready to do anything to help him and Castalia out of England. Of that there could be no doubt. \\n\\n \\n\\n It must be owned that Algernon had so far justified the quick suspicions of his Whitford creditors and acquaintances as to have conceived for a moment the idea of never more returning to that uninteresting town. It was extremely exhilarating to be in the position of a bachelor at large; to find himself free, for a time, of the dead weight of debt, which seemed to make breathing difficult in Whitford; for, although by plodding characters the relief might not have been felt until the debts were paid, Algernon Errington\u0027s spirit was of a sort that rose buoyant as ever, directly the external pressure was removed. It was delightful to be reinstated in the enjoyment of his reputation as a charming fellow—much fallen into oblivion at Whitford. And perhaps it was pleasantest of all to feel strengthened in the assurance that he still was a charming fellow, with capacities for winning admiration and making a brilliant figure, quite uninjured (although they had been temporarily eclipsed) by all the cloud of troubles which had gathered around him. \\n\\n \\n\\n So he had, for a moment, thought of fairly running away from wife, and duns, and dangers of official severities. But it was but a brief unsubstantial vision that flashed for an instant and was gone. Algernon was too clear-sighted not to perceive that the course was inconvenient—nay, to one of his temperament, impracticable. People who started off to live on their wits in a foreign country ought to be armed with a coarser indifference to material comforts than he was gifted with. Alternations of ortolans and champagne, with bread and onions, would be—even supposing one could be sure of the ortolans, which Algernon knew he could not—entirely repugnant to his temperament. He had no such strain of adventurousness as would have given a pleasant glow of excitement to the endurance of privation under any circumstances whatever. Professed Bohemians might talk as they pleased about kicking over traces, and getting rid of trammels, and so forth; but, for his part, he had never felt his spirit in the least oppressed by velvet hangings, gilded furniture, or French cookery! Whereas to be obliged to wear shabby gloves would have been a kind of \"trammel\" he would strongly have objected to. In a word, he desired to be luxuriously comfortable always. And he consistently (albeit, perhaps, mistakenly, for the cleverest of us are liable to error) endeavoured to be so. \\n\\n \\n\\n Therefore he did not ship himself aboard an emigrant vessel for the United States; nor did he even cross the Channel to Calais; but found himself in a corner of the mail-coach on the night after Jack Price\u0027s supper party, bowling along, not altogether unpleasantly, towards Whitford. He had not seen Lord Seely again. He had inquired for him at his house, and had been told that his lordship was worse; was confined to bed entirely; and that Dr. Nokes had called in two other physicians in consultation. \"Deuce of a job if he dies before I get a berth!\" thought Algernon. But before he had gone many yards down the street, he was in a great measure reassured as to that danger, by seeing Lady Seely in her big yellow coach, with Fido on the seat beside her, and her favourite nephew lounging on the cushions opposite. The nephew had been apparently entertaining Lady Seely by some amusing story, for she was laughing (rather to the ear than the eye, as was her custom; for my lady made a great noise, sending out \"Ha-ha-ha\u0027s!\" with a kind of defiant distinctness, whilst all the while eyes and mouth plainly professed themselves disdainful of too cordial a hilarity, and ready to stop short in a second), and stroking Fido very unconcernedly with one fat tightly-gloved hand. Now although Algernon did not give my lady credit for much depth of sentiment, he felt sure that she would, for various reasons, have been greatly disquieted had any danger threatened her husband\u0027s life, and would certainly not have left his side to drive in the Park with young Reginald. So he drew the inference that my lord was not so desperately ill as he had been told, and that the servants had had orders to give him that account in order to keep him away—which was pretty nearly the fact. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The old woman would be in a fury with me when my lord told her he had promised me that post without consulting her,\" thought Algernon; \"and would tell any lie to keep me out of the house. But we shall beat her this time.\" As he so thought he pulled off his hat and made so distinguished and condescending a bow to my lady, that her nephew, who was near-sighted and did not recognise Errington, pulled off his own hat in a hurry, very awkwardly, and acknowledged the salute with some confused idea that the graceful gentleman was a foreigner of distinction; whilst my lady, turning purple, shook her head at him in anger at the whole incident. All which Algernon saw, understood, and was immensely diverted by. \\n\\n \\n\\n In summing up the results of his journey to town, he was satisfied. Things were certainly not so pleasant as they might be. But were they not better, on the whole, than when he had left Whitford? He decidedly thought they were; which did not, of course, diminish his sense of being a victim to circumstances and the Seely family. Anyway he had broken with Whitford. My lord must get him out of that baraque! The very thought of leaving the place raised his spirits. And, as he had the coach to himself during nearly all the journey, he was able to stretch his legs and make himself comfortable; and he awoke from a sound and refreshing sleep as the mail-coach rattled into the High Street and rumbled under the archway of the \"Blue Bell.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The hour was early, and the morning was raw, and Algernon resolved to refresh himself with a hot bath and breakfast before proceeding to Ivy Lodge. \"No use disturbing Mrs. Errington so early,\" he said to the landlord, who appeared just as Algernon was sipping his tea before a blazing fire. \"Very good devilled kidneys, Mr. Rumbold,\" he added condescendingly. Mr. Rumbold rubbed his hands and stood looking half-sulkily, half-deferentially at his guest. His wife had said to him, \"Don\u0027t you go chatting with that young Errington, Rumbold; not if you want to get your money. I know what he is, and I know what you are, Rumbold; and he\u0027ll talk you over in no time.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n But Mr. Rumbold had allowed his own valour to override his wife\u0027s discretion, and had declared that he would make the young man understand before he left the \"Blue Bell\" that it was absolutely necessary to settle his account there without delay. And the result justified Mrs. Rumbold\u0027s apprehension; for Algernon Errington drove away from the inn without having paid even for the breakfast he had eaten there that morning, and having added the vehicle which carried him home to the long list beginning \"Flys: A. Errington, Esq.,\" in which he figured as debtor to the landlord of the \"Blue Bell.\" He had flourished Lord Seely in Mr. Rumbold\u0027s face with excellent effect, and was feeling quite cheerful when he alighted at the gate of Ivy Lodge. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was still early according to Castalia\u0027s reckoning—little more than ten o\u0027clock. So he was not surprised at not finding her in the drawing-room or the dining-room. Lydia, of whom he inquired at length as to where her mistress was, having first bade her light a fire for him to have a cigar by, before going to the office—Lydia said with a queer, half-scared, half-saucy look, \"Laws, sir, missus has been out this hour and a half.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Out!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, sir. She said as how she couldn\u0027t rest in her bed, nor yet in the house, sir. Polly made her take a cup of tea, and then she went off to Whit Meadow.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"To Whit Meadow! In this damp raw weather at nine o\u0027clock in the morning!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Please, sir, me and Polly thought it wasn\u0027t safe for missus, and her so delicate. But she would go.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Algernon shrugged his shoulders and said no more. Before the girl left the room, she said, \"Oh, and please, sir, here\u0027s some letters as came for you,\" pointing to a little heap of papers on Castalia\u0027s desk. \\n\\n \\n\\n Left alone, Algernon drew his chair up to the fire and lit a cigar. He did not hasten himself to examine the letters. Bills, of course! What else could they be? He began to smoke and ruminate. He would have liked to see Castalia before going to the office. He would have liked to make his own representation to her of the story he had told Lord Seely. She must be got to corroborate it unknowingly if possible. He reflected with some bitterness that she had lately shown so much power of opposing him, that it might be she would insist on taking a course of conduct which would upset all the combination he—with the help of chance circumstances—had so neatly pieced together. And then he reflected further, knitting his brows a little, that at any cost she must be prevented from spoiling his plans; and that her conduct lately had been so strange that it wouldn\u0027t be very difficult to convince the world of her insanity. \"\u0027Gad, I\u0027m almost convinced of it myself,\" said Algernon, half aloud. But it was not true. \\n\\n \\n\\n The fire was warm, the room was quiet, the cigar was good, the chair was easy. Algernon felt tempted to sit still and put off the moment when he must re-enter the Whitford Post-office. He shuddered as he thought of the place with a kind of physical repulsion. Nevertheless, it must be faced once or twice more. Not much more often, he hoped. He rose up, put on a great-coat, and said to himself lazily as he ran his fingers through his hair in front of the looking-glass, \"Where the devil can Castalia have gone mooning to?\" Then he turned to leave the room. As he turned his eyes fell on the little heap of letters. He took them up and turned them over with a grimace. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"H\u0027m! Ravell—respectful compliments. Ah! no; your mouth ought to have been stopped, I think! But that\u0027s the way. More they get, more they want. Never pay an instalment. Fatal precedent! What\u0027s this—a lawyer\u0027s letter! Gladwish. Oh! Very well, Mr. Gladwish. Nous verrons. Chemist! What on earth—? Oh, rose-water! Better than his boluses, I daresay, but not very good, and quite humorously dear. Extortionate rascal! And who are you, my illiterate-looking friend?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He took a square blue envelope between his finger and thumb, and examined the cramped handwriting on it, running in a slanting line from one corner to the other. It was addressed to \"Mr. Algernon Errington.\" \"Some very angry creditor, who won\u0027t even indulge me with the customary \u0027Esquire,\u0027\" thought Algernon with a contemptuous smile and some genuine amusement. Then he opened it. It was from Jonathan Maxfield! \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2168/61315.html","bookId":444,"book":{"id":444,"title":"A Charming Fellow","description":"简介： The room was very quiet.
