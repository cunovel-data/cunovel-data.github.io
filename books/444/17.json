{"id":21619,"no":17,"title":"CHAPTER XVII.","content":"Algernon was elated by the success of his song, and by Lady Seely\u0027s full acknowledgment of his cousinship, and he left the mansion in Mayfair in very good spirits, as has been said. But when he got back to his inn—a private hotel in a dingy street behind Oxford Street—he began to feel a recurrence of the disappointment which had oppressed him, when Lady Seely had declared so emphatically that my lord could do nothing for him, in the way of getting him a place. What was to be done? It was all very well for his mother to say that, with his talents and appearance, he must and would make his way to a high position; but, just and reasonable as it would be that his talents and appearance should give him success, he began to fear that they might not altogether avail to do so. He thought of Mr. Filthorpe—that substance, which Mr. Diamond had said they were deserting for the shadow of Seely—and of the thousands of pounds which the Bristol merchant possessed. Truly a stool in a counting-house was not the post which Algernon coveted. And he candidly told himself that he should not be able to fill it effectively. But, still, there would have been at least as good a chance of fascinating Mr. Filthorpe as of fascinating Lord Seely, and the looked-for result of the fascination in either case was to be absolution from the necessity of doing any disagreeable work whatever. And, moreover, Mr. Filthorpe, at all events, would have supplied board and lodging and a small salary, whilst he was undergoing the progress of being fascinated. Algernon looked thoughtful and anxious, for full a quarter of an hour, as he pondered these things. But then he fell into a fit of laughter at the recollection of Lady Seely and Fido. \"There is something very absurd about that old woman,\" said he to himself. \"She is so impudent! And why wear a wig at all, if a wig is to be such a one as hers? A turban or a skull-cap would do just as well to cover her head with. But then they wouldn\u0027t be half so funny. Fido is something like his mistress—nearly as fat, and with the same style of profile.\" Then he set himself to draw a caricature representing Fido, attired after the fashion of Lady Seely, and became quite cheerful and buoyant over it. In the interval between the day of his visit to the Seelys and the Thursday on which he was to dine with them, Algernon made one or two calls, and delivered a couple of letters of introduction, with which his Whitford friends had furnished him. One was from Dr. Bodkin to an old-fashioned solicitor, who was reputed to be rich, but who lived in a very quiet way, in a very quiet square, and gave very quiet little dinners to a select few who could appreciate a really fine glass of port. The other letter was to a sister of young Mr. Pawkins, of Pudcombe Hall, married to the chief clerk of the Admiralty, who lived in a fashionable neighbourhood, and gave parties as fashionable as her visiting-list permitted, and by no means desired any special connoisseurship in wine on the part of her guests. On the occasion of his first calls, Algernon found neither Mr. Leadbeater, the solicitor, nor Mrs. Machyn-Stubbs (that was the name of young Pawkins\u0027s sister) at home. So he left his letters and cards, and wandered about the streets in a rather forlorn way; for although it was his first visit to London, it was not possible for him to get much enjoyment out of the metropolis, all alone. To him every place, even London, appeared in the light of a stage or background, whereon that supremely interesting personage, himself, might figure to more or less advantage. Now London is a big theatre. And although a big theatre full of spectators may be very exhilarating to the object of public attention who performs in it, a big theatre, practically barren of spectators—for, of course, the only real spectators are the spectators who look at us—is apt to oppress the mind with a sense of desertion. So he was very glad when Thursday evening came, and he found himself once more within the hall door of Lord Seely\u0027s house. My lord was in the drawing-room alone, standing on the hearth-rug. He shook hands very kindly with Algernon, and bade him come near to the fire and warm himself, for the evening was cold. \"And what have you been doing with yourself, Mr. Errington?\" asked Lord Seely. \"I have been chiefly employed to-day in losing myself and asking my way,\" answered Algernon, laughing. And then he began an account of his adventures, and absolutely surprised himself by the amount of fun and sparkle he contrived to elicit from the narration of circumstances which had been in fact dull and commonplace enough. My lord was greatly amused, and once even laughed out loud at Algernon\u0027s imitation of an Irish apple-woman, who had misdirected him with the best intentions, and much calling down of blessings on his handsome face, in return for a silver sixpence. \"Capital!\" said my lord, nodding his head up and down. \"The sixpence was badly invested, though,\" observed Algernon, \"for she sent me about three miles out of my way.\" \"Ah, but the blarney! You forget the blessing and the blarney. Surely they were worth the money, eh?\" \"No, my lord; not to me. I can\u0027t afford expensive luxuries.\" Lady Seely, when she entered the room, gorgeous in pea-green satin, which singularly set off the somewhat pronounced tone of her rouge, found Algy and my lord laughing together very merrily, and, as she gave her hand to her young relative, demanded to be informed what the joke was. Now it has been said that Algernon was possessed of wonderfully rapid powers of perception, and by sundry signs, so slight that they would have entirely escaped most observers, this clever young gentleman perceived that my lady was not altogether delighted at finding her husband and himself on such easy and pleasant terms together. In fact, my lady, with all her blunt careless jollity of manner and pleasant mellow voice, was apt to be both jealous and suspicious. She was jealous of her ascendancy over Lord Seely, who was said by the ill-natured to be completely under his wife\u0027s thumb, and she was suspicious of most strangers—especially of strangers who might be expected to want anything of his lordship. And she usually assumed that such persons would endeavour to \"come over\" that nobleman, when he was apart from his wife\u0027s protecting influence. She had a general theory that \"men might be humbugged into anything;\" and a particular experience that Lord Seely, despite his stiff carriage and abrupt manner, was in truth far softer-natured than she was herself. \"That young scamp has been coming over Valentine with his jokes and his flummery,\" said my lady to herself. \"He\u0027s an Ancram, every inch of him.\" At that very moment Algernon was mentally declaring that the conquest of my lady would, after all, be a more difficult matter than that of my lord; but that, by some means or other, the conquest must be made, if any good was to come to him from the Seely connection. And a stream of easy chat flowed over these underlying intentions and hid them, except that here and there, perhaps, a bubble or an eddy told of rough places out of sight. After some ten minutes of desultory talk, my lady was obliged to own to herself that the \"young scamp\" had a wonderfully good manner. Without a trace of servility, he was respectful; conveying, with perfect tact, exactly the sort of homage that was graceful and becoming from a youth like himself to persons of the Seelys\u0027 age and position. Neither did he commit the error of becoming familiar, in response to Lady Seely\u0027s tone of familiarity, a pitfall which had before now entrapped the unwary. For my lady, whom Nature had created vulgar—having possibly, in the hurry of business, mistaken one kind of clay for another, and put some low person\u0027s mind into the fine porcelain of an undoubted Ancram—was fond of asserting her position in the world by a rough unceremoniousness in the first place, and a very wide-eyed arrogance in the second place, if such unceremoniousness chanced to be reciprocated by unauthorised persons. \"Do we wait for any one, Belinda?\" asked Lord Seely. \"The Dormers are coming. They\u0027re such great musicians, you know. And I want Lady Harriet to hear this boy sing. And then there may be Jack Price, very likely.\" \"Very likely?\" said my lord, raising his eyebrows and stiffening his back. \"Doesn\u0027t Mr. Price do us the honour of saying positively whether he will come or not?\" \"Oh, you know what Jack Price is. He says he\u0027ll come, and nine times out of ten he don\u0027t come; and then the tenth time he comes, and people have to put up with him.\" My lord cleared his throat significantly, as who should say that he, at all events, did not feel inclined to put up with this system of tithes in the fulfilment of Mr. Jack Price\u0027s promises. \"If he comes,\" said Lady Seely, addressing Algernon, \"you\u0027ll have to walk into dinner by yourself. I\u0027ve only got one young lady; and, if Jack comes, he must have her.\" \"Where is Castalia?\" asked my lord. \"Oh, I suppose she\u0027s dressing. Castalia is always the slowest creature at her toilet I ever knew.\" Algernon had read up the family genealogy in the \"Peerage,\" under his mother\u0027s instructions, sufficiently to be aware that Lord and Lady Seely were childless, having lost their only son in a boating accident years ago. \"Castalia,\" then, could not be a daughter of the house. Who was she? A young lady who was evidently at present living with the Seelys, whom they called by her Christian name, and who was habitually a long time at her toilet! Algernon felt a little agreeable excitement and curiosity on the subject of the tardy Castalia. The door was thrown open. \"Here she comes!\" thought Algernon, settling his cravat as he threw a quick side glance at a mirror. \"General and Lady Harriet Dormer,\" announced the servant. There entered a tall, elegant woman, leaning on the arm of a short, stout, benevolent-looking man in spectacles. To these personages Algernon was duly presented, being introduced, much to his gratification, by Lady Seely, as \"A young cousin of mine, Mr. Ancram Errington, who has just come to town.\" Then, having made his bow to General Dormer, who smiled and shook hands with him, Algernon stood opposite to the graceful Lady Harriet, and was talked to very kindly and pleasantly, and felt extremely content with himself and his surroundings. Nevertheless he watched with some impatience for the appearance of \"Castalia;\" and forgot his usual self-possession so far as to turn his head, and break off in the middle of a sentence he was uttering to Lady Harriet, when he heard the door open again. But once more he was disappointed; for, this time, dinner was announced, and Lord Seely offered his arm to Lady Harriet and led the way out of the room. \"No Jack,\" said Lady Seely, as she passed out before Algernon. \"And no Castalia!\" said my lord over his shoulder, in a tone of vexation. Algernon followed his seniors alone; but just as he got out on to the staircase there appeared a lady, leisurely descending from an upper floor, at whom Lord Seely looked up reproachfully. \"Late, late, Castalia!\" said he, and shook his head solemnly. \"Oh no, Uncle Valentine; just in time,\" replied the lady. \"Castalia, take Ancram\u0027s arm, and do let us get to dinner before the soup is cold,\" said Lady Seely. \"Give your arm to Miss Kilfinane, and come along.\" And her ladyship\u0027s pea-green satin swept downstairs after Lady Harriet\u0027s sober purple draperies. Algernon bowed, and offered his arm to the lady beside him; she placed her hand on it almost without looking at him, and they entered the dining-room without having exchanged a word. The dining-room was better lighted than the staircase, and Algernon took an early opportunity of looking at his companion. She was not very young, being, in fact, nearly thirty, but looking older. Neither was she handsome. She was very thin, sallow, and sickly-looking, with a small round face, not wrinkled, but crumpled, as it were, into queer, fretful lines. Her eyes were bright and well-shaped, but deeply sunken, and she had a great deal of thick, pale-brown hair, worn in huge bows and festoons on the top of her head, according to the extreme of the mode of that day. Her dress displayed more than it was judicious to display, in an ?sthetic point of view, of very lean shoulders, and was of a bright, soft, pink hue, that would have been trying to the most blooming complexion. Altogether, the Honourable Castalia Kilfinane\u0027s appearance was disappointing, and her manner was not so attractive as to make up for lack of beauty. Her face expressed a mixture of querulousness and hauteur, and she spoke in a languid drawl, with strange peevish inflections. \"You and I ought to be some sort of relations to each other, oughtn\u0027t we?\" said Algernon, having taken in all the above particulars in a series of rapid observations. \"Why?\" returned the lady, without raising her eyes from her soup-plate. \"Because you are Lady Seely\u0027s niece and I am her cousin.\" \"Who says that I am Lady Seely\u0027s niece?\" \"I thought,\" stammered Algernon—\"I fancied—you called Lord Seely \u0027Uncle Valentine?\u0027\" Even his equanimity, and a certain glow of complacency he felt at finding himself where he was, were a little disturbed by Miss Castalia\u0027s freezing manner. \"I am Lord Seely\u0027s niece,\" returned she. Then, after a little pause, having finished her soup, she leaned back in her chair and stared at Algernon, who pretended—not quite successfully—to be unconscious of her scrutiny. Apparently, the result of it was favourable to Algernon; for the lady\u0027s manner thawed perceptibly, and she began to talk to him. She had evidently heard of him from Lady Seely, and understood the exact degree of his relationship to that great lady. \"Did you ever meet the Dormers before?\" asked Miss Kilfinane. \"Never. How should I? You know I am the merest country mouse. I never was in London in my life, until last Friday.\" \"Oh, but the Dormers don\u0027t live in town. Indeed, they are here very seldom. You might have met them; their place is in the West of England.\" Algernon, after a rapid balancing of pros and cons, resolved to be absolutely candid. With his brightest smile and most arched eyebrows, he began to give Miss Kilfinane an almost unvarnished description of his life at Whitford. Almost unvarnished; but it is no more easy to tell the simple truth only occasionally, than it is to stand quite upright only occasionally. Mind and muscles will fall back to their habitual posture. So that it may be doubted whether Miss Kilfinane received an accurate notion of the precise degree of poverty and obscurity in which the young man who was speaking to her had hitherto lived. \"And so,\" said she, \"you have come to London to——\" \"To seek my fortune,\" said Algernon merrily. \"It is the proper and correct beginning to a story. And I think I have had a piece of good luck at the very outset by way of a good omen.\" Miss Kilfinane opened her eyes interrogatively, but said nothing. \"I think it was a piece of luck for me,\" continued Algernon, emboldened by having secured the scornful lady\u0027s attention, and perhaps a little also by the wine he had drunk, \"a great piece of good luck that Mr. Jack Price, whoever he may be, did not turn up this evening.\" \"Why?\" \"Because, if he had, I should not have been allowed the honour of bringing you in to dinner.\" \"Oh yes! I should have had to go in with Jack, I suppose,\" answered the lady with a little smile. \"Please, Miss Kilfinane, who is Jack Price? I do so want to know!\" \"Jack Price is Lord Mullingar\u0027s son.\" \"But what is he? And why do people want to have him so much, that they put up with his disappointing them nine times out of ten?\" \"As to what he is—well, he was in the Guards, and he gave that up. Then they got him a place somewhere—in Africa, or South America, or somewhere—and he gave that up. Then he got the notion that he would be a farmer in Canada, and went out with an axe to cut down the trees, and a plough to plough the ground afterwards, and he gave that up. Now he does nothing particular.\" \"And has he found his vocation at last?\" \"I don\u0027t know, I\u0027m sure,\" said Miss Kilfinane, languidly. Her power of perceiving a joke was very limited. \"Thanks. Now I know all about Mr. Price; except—except why everybody wants to invite him.\" \"That I really cannot tell you.\" \"Then you don\u0027t share the general enthusiasm about him?\" \"I don\u0027t know that there is any general enthusiasm. Only, of course—don\u0027t you know how it is?—people have got into the way of putting up with him, and letting him do as he likes.\" \"He\u0027s a very fortunate young man, I should say.\" \"Young man!\" Miss Kilfinane laughed a hard little laugh. \"Why Jack Price is ever so old!\" \"Ever so old, is he?\" echoed Algernon, genuinely surprised. \"He must be turned forty,\" said the fair Castalia, rising in obedience to a look from Lady Seely. And if she had been but fifteen herself, she could not have said it with a more infantine air. After the ladies had withdrawn, Algernon had to sit for about twenty minutes in the shade, as it were, silent, and listening with modesty and discretion to the conversation of his seniors. Had they talked politics, Algernon would have been able to throw in a word or two; but Lord Seely and his guest talked, not of principles or party, but of persons. The persons talked of were such as Lord Seely conceived to be useful or hostile to his party, and he discussed their conduct, and criticised the tactics of ministers in regard to them, with much warmth. But, unfortunately, Algernon neither knew, nor could pretend to know, anything about these individuals, so he sipped his wine, and looked at the family portraits which hung round the room, in silence. My lord made a kind of apology to him, as they were going upstairs to the drawing-room. \"I\u0027m afraid you were bored, Mr. Errington. I am sorry, for your sake, that Mr. Price did not honour us with his company. You would have found him much more amusing than us old fogies.\" Algernon knew, when Lord Seely talked of Mr. Price not having honoured them with his company, that my lord was indignant against that gentleman. \"I have no doubt Mr. Price is a very agreeable person,\" said he, \"but I did not regret him, my lord. I thought it a great privilege to be allowed to listen to you.\" Later in the evening Algy overheard Lord Seely say to General Dormer, \"He\u0027s a remarkably intelligent young fellow, I assure you.\" \"He has a capital manner,\" returned the general. \"There is something very taking about him, indeed.\" \"Oh yes, manner; yes; a very good manner—but there\u0027s more judgment, more solidity about him than appears on the surface.\" Meanwhile, Algernon went on flourishingly, and ingratiated himself with every one. He steered his way, with admirable tact, past various perils, such as must inevitably threaten one who aims at universal popularity. Lady Harriet was delighted with his singing, and Lady Harriet\u0027s expressed approbation pleased Lady Seely; for the Dormers were considered to be great musical connoisseurs, and their judgment had considerable weight among their own set. Their own set further supposed that the verdict of the Dormers was important to professional artists: a delusion which the givers of second-rate concerts, who depended on Lady Harriet to get rid of many seven-and-sixpenny tickets during the season, were at no pains to disturb. Then, Algernon took the precaution to keep away from Lord Seely, and to devote himself to my lady, during the remainder of the evening. This behaviour had so good an effect, that she called him \"Ancram,\" and bade him go and talk to Castalia, who was sitting alone on a distant ottoman, with a distinctly sour expression of countenance. \"How did you get on with Castalia at dinner?\" asked my lady. \"Miss Kilfinane was very kind to me, ma\u0027am.\" \"Was she? Well, she don\u0027t make herself agreeable to everybody, so consider yourself honoured. Castalia\u0027s a very clever girl. She can draw, make wax flowers, and play the piano beautifully.\" \"Can she really? Will she play to-night?\" \"I\u0027m sure I don\u0027t know. Go and ask her.\" \"May I?\" \"Yes; be off.\" Miss Kilfinane did not move or raise her eyes when Algernon went and stood before her. \"I have come with a petition,\" he said, after a little pause. \"Have you?\" \"Yes; will you play to-night?\" \"No.\" \"Oh, that\u0027s very cruel! I wish you would!\" \"I don\u0027t like playing before the Dormers. They set up for being such connoisseurs, and I hate that kind of thing.\" \"I am sure you can have no reason to fear their criticism.\" \"I don\u0027t want to have my performance picked to pieces in that knowing sort of way. I play for my own amusement, and I don\u0027t want to be criticised, and applauded, and patronised.\" \"But how can people help applauding when you play? Lady Seely says you play exquisitely.\" \"Did she tell you to ask me to play?\" \"Not exactly. But she said I might ask you.\" At this moment General Dormer came up, and said, with his most benevolent smile, \"Won\u0027t you give us a little music, Miss Kilfinane? Some Beethoven, now! I see a volume of his sonatas on the piano.\" \"I hate Beethoven,\" returned Miss Kilfinane. \"Hate Beethoven! No, no, you don\u0027t. It\u0027s quite impossible! A pianist like you! Oh no, Miss Kilfinane, it is out of the question.\" \"Yes, I do. I hate all classical music, and the sort of stuff that people talk about it.\" The general smiled again, shook his head, shrugged his shoulders, and walked away. \"Miss Kilfinane, you are ferociously cruel!\" said Algernon under his breath as General Dormer turned his back on them. The little fear he had had of Castalia\u0027s chilly manner and ungracious tongue had quite vanished. Algernon was not apt to be in awe of anyone; and he certainly was not in awe of Castalia Kilfinane. \"Why did you tell the general that you hated Beethoven?\" he went on saucily. \"I\u0027m quite sure you don\u0027t hate Beethoven!\" \"I hate all the kind of professional jargon which the Dormers affect about music. Music is all very well, but it isn\u0027t our business, any more than tailoring or millinery is our business. To hear the Dormers talk, you would think it the most important matter in the world to decide whether this fiddler is better than that fiddler, or what is the right time to play a fugue of Bach\u0027s in.\" \"I\u0027m such an ignoramus that I\u0027m afraid I don\u0027t even know with any precision what a fugue of Bach\u0027s is!\" said Algernon, ingenuously. He thought he had learned to understand Miss Castalia. Nevertheless, when, later in the evening, Lady Harriet asked him in her pretty silver tones, \"And do you, too, hate classical music, Mr. Errington?\" he professed the most unbounded love and reverence for the great masters. \"I have had few opportunities of hearing fine music, Lady Harriet,\" said he; \"but it is the thing I have longed for all my life.\" Whereupon Lady Harriet, much pleased at the prospect of such a disciple, invited him to go to her house every Saturday morning, when he would hear some of the best performers in London execute some of the best music. \"I only ask real listeners,\" said Lady Harriet. \"We are just a few music-lovers who take the thing very much au sérieux.\" On the whole, when Algernon thought over his evening, sitting over the fire in his bedroom at the inn, he acknowledged to himself that he had been successful. \"Lady Seely is the toughest customer, though! What a fish-wife she looks beside that elegant Lady Harriet! But she can put on airs of a great lady too, when she likes. It\u0027s a very fine line that divides dignity from impudence. Take her wig off, wash her face, and clothe her in a short cotton gown with a white apron, and how many people would know that Belinda, Lady Seely, had ever been anything but a cook, or the landlady of a public-house? Well, I think I am cleverer than any of \u0027em. And, after all, that\u0027s a great point.\" With which comfortable reflection Algernon Ancram Errington went to bed, and to sleep.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2168/61278.html","bookId":444,"book":{"id":444,"title":"A Charming Fellow","description":"简介： The room was very quiet.
