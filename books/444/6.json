{"id":21608,"no":6,"title":"CHAPTER VI.","content":"It is exceedingly disagreeable to find that a scheme you have set your head on, or a prospect which smiles before you, is displeasing to the persons who surround you. It gives a cold shock to the glow of anticipation. \n \n Algernon did not perhaps care to sympathise very keenly with other folks\u0027 pleasure, but he certainly desired that they should be pleased with what pleased him, which is not quite the same thing. \n \n His mother informed him—perhaps with a dash of the Ancram colouring; although we have seen how unjustly the worthy lady was suspected of falsehood by Dr. Bodkin on a late occasion—that Mr. Diamond disapproved of his refusing Mr. Filthorpe\u0027s offer, and of his resolve to go to London. Dr. Bodkin, Algernon knew, did not approve it; neither did Minnie, although she had never said so in words. How unpleasantly chilly people were, to be sure! \n \n Mrs. Errington did not like Mr. Diamond. She mistrusted him. His silence and gravity, his odd sarcastic smiles, and taciturn politeness, made her uneasy. Despite the patronising way in which she had spoken of him to Minnie Bodkin, in her heart she thought the young man to be horribly presuming. \n \n \"I\u0027m sure he doesn\u0027t appreciate you at all, Algy,\" she declared, winding up a list of Mr. Diamond\u0027s defects and misdemeanours with this culminating accusation. \n \n Algy had a shrewd notion that Mr. Diamond\u0027s appreciation of himself was likely to be a just one, and he was a little vexed and discomfited, that his tutor had given him no word of praise behind his back. Mrs. Errington saw that she had made an impression, and began to heighten and embellish her statements accordingly. \"But, my dear boy,\" said she, \"how can we expect him to recognise talents like yours—gentlemanly talents, so to speak? The man himself is a mere plodder. Why, he was a sizar at college!\" \n \n Algy felt himself to be a very generous fellow for continuing to \"stand up for old Diamond,\" as he phrased it. \n \n \"Well, ma\u0027am, plenty of great men have been poor scholars. Dean Swift was a sizar.\" \n \n \"And Dean Swift died in a madhouse! So you see, Algy!\" \n \n Mrs. Errington plumed herself a good deal upon this retort, and returned to the attack upon Mr. Diamond with fresh vigour; being one of those persons whose mode of warfare is elephantine, and who, never content with merely killing their enemy, must ponderously stamp and mash every semblance of humanity out of him. \n \n Algernon did not like all this. His vanity was—at least during this period of his life—a great deal more vulnerable than his mother\u0027s. And she, although she doated on him, would say unpleasant things, indignantly repeat mortifying remarks which had been made, and in a hundred ways unconsciously wound the sensitive love of approbation which was one of Algernon\u0027s tenderest (not to say weakest) points. \n \n It was all very disagreeable. But it was not the worst he had to look forward to. There was one person who would be so cast down, so despairing, at the news of his going away, that—that—it would be quite painful for a fellow to witness such grief. And yet it could not be expected—it could never have been expected—that he should stay in Whitford all his life! He must point that out to Rhoda. \n \n Poor Rhoda! \n \n For ten years, that is to say for more than half her life, Algernon Errington had been an idol, a hero, to her. From the first day when, peeping from behind the parlour door, she had beheld the strangers enter—Mrs. Errington, majestic, in a huge hat and plume, such as young readers may have seen in obsolete fashion books (the mode was so absurd fifty years ago, and had none of that simple elegance which distinguishes your costume, my dear young lady), and Algy, a lovely fair child, in a black velvet suit and falling collar—from that moment the boy had been a radiant apparition in her imagination. How small, and poor, and shabby she felt, as she peeped out of the parlour at that beautiful, blooming mother and son! Not poor and shabby in a milliner\u0027s sense of the word, but literally of no account, or beauty, or value, in the world, little shy motherless thing! She had an intense delight in beauty, this Whitford grocer\u0027s daughter. And all her little life the craving for beauty in her had been starved: not wilfully, but because the very conception of such food as would wholesomely have fed it, was wanting in the people with whom she lived. \n \n That was a great day when she first, by chance, attracted Mrs. Errington\u0027s notice. She was too timid and too simple to scheme for that end, as many children would have done, although she tremblingly desired it. What a surprisingly splendid sight was the tortoise-shell work-box, full of amber satin and silver! What a delightful revelation the sound of the old harpsichord, touched by Mrs. Errington\u0027s plump white fingers! What a perennial source of wonder and admiration were that lady\u0027s accomplishments, and condescension, and kind soft voice! \n \n As to Algernon, there never was such a clever and brilliant little boy. At eight years old he could sing little songs to his mother\u0027s accompaniment, in the sweetest piping voice. He could recite little verses. He even drew quite so that you could tell—or Rhoda could—his trees, houses, and men from one another. \n \n In all the stories his mother told about the greatness of her family, and in all the descriptions she gave of her ancestral home in Warwickshire, Rhoda\u0027s imagination put in the boy as the central figure of the piece. She could see him in the great hall hung round with armour; although she knew that he had never been in the family mansion in his life; in the grand drawing-room, with its purple carpet and gilt furniture; above all, in the long portrait gallery, of which Rhoda was never tired of hearing. Heaven knows how she, innocently, and Mrs. Errington, exercising her hereditary talent, embellished and transformed the old brick house in its deer park; or what enchanted landscapes the child at all events conjured up, among the gentle slopes and tufted woods of Warwickshire! \n \n Even the period of hobbledehoydom, fatal to beauty, to grace, almost to civilised humanity in most schoolboys, Algernon passed through triumphantly. He had a great sense of humour, and fastidious pampered habits of mind and body, which enabled him to look down with more or less disdain—a good-humoured disdain, always, Algy was never bitter—upon the obstreperous youth at the Whitford Grammar School. \n \n One fight he had. He was forced into it by circumstances, against his will. Not that he was a coward, but he had a greater, and more candidly expressed regard for the ease and comfort of his body, than his schoolfellows conceived to be compatible with pluck. However, our young friend, if less stoical, was a great deal cleverer than the majority of his peers; and perceiving that the moment had arrived when he must either fight or lose caste altogether, he frankly accepted the former alternative. He fought a boy bigger and heavier than himself, got beaten (not severely, but fairly well beaten) and bore his defeat—in the dialect of his compeers, \"took his licking\"—admirably. He was quite as popular afterwards, as if he had thrashed his adversary, who was a loutish boy, the cock of the school, as to strength. Had he bruised his way to the perilous glory of being cock of the school himself, it would have behoved him to maintain it against all comers; which is an anxious and harassing position. Algy had not vanquished the victor, but he had \"taken his licking like a trump,\" and, on the whole, may be said to have achieved his reputation, at the smallest cost possible under the circumstances. \n \n His mother and Rhoda almost shrieked at beholding his bruised cheek, and bleeding lip, when he came home one half-holiday, from the field of battle. Algy laughed as well as his swollen features would let him, and calmed their feminine apprehensions. Nor would he accept his fond parent\u0027s enthusiastic praise of his heroism, mingled with denunciations of \"that murderous young ruffian, Master Mannit.\" \n \n \"Pooh, ma\u0027am,\" said the hero, \"it\u0027s all brutal and low enough. We bumped and thumped each other as awkwardly as possible. I fought because I was obliged. And I didn\u0027t like it, and I shan\u0027t fight again if I can help it. It is so stupid!\" \n \n The young fellow\u0027s great charm was to be unaffected. Even his fine-gentlemanism sat quite easily on him, and was displayed with the frankest good humour. Some one reproached him once with being more nice than wise. \"We can\u0027t all be wise, but we needn\u0027t be nasty!\" returned Algy, with quaint gravity. His temper was, as Minnie Bodkin had said, nearly perfect. He had a singular knack of disarming anger or hostility. You could not laugh Algernon out of any course he had set his heart upon—a rare kind of strength at his age—but it was ten to one he would laugh you into agreeing with him. Every one of his little gifts and accomplishments was worth twice as much in him as it would have been in clumsier hands. \n \n If you had a heartache, I do not think that you would have found Algy\u0027s companionship altogether soothing. Sorrow is apt to feel the very sunshine cruelly bright and cheerful. But if you were merry and wanted society: or bored, and wanted amusement: or dull and wanted exhilarating, no better companion could be desired. \n \n He was genial with his equals, affable to his inferiors, modest towards his superiors—and had not a grain of veneration in his whole composition. \n \n At seventeen years old Algernon left the Grammar School. But he continued to \"read\" with Mr. Diamond for nearly a twelvemonth. \"My son is studying the classics with Mr. Diamond,\" Mrs. Errington would say; \"I can\u0027t send my boy to the University, where all his forefathers distinguished themselves. But he has had the education of a gentleman.\" \n \n It was a very desultory kind of reading at the best, and it was interrupted by the long Midsummer holidays, during which Mr. Diamond went away from Whitford, no one knew exactly whither. And during these same holidays, Mrs. Errington, who said she required change of air, had taken lodgings in a little quiet Welsh village, and obtained Mr. Maxfield\u0027s permission to have Rhoda with her. \n \n That was a time of joy for the girl. It did not at all detract from Rhoda\u0027s happiness, that she was required to wait hand and foot on Mrs. Errington; to bring her her breakfast in bed; to trim her caps, to mend her stockings; to iron out scraps of fine lace and muslin; to walk with her when she was minded to stroll into the village; to order the dinner; to make the pudding—a culinary operation too delicate for the fingers of the rustic with whom they lodged—to listen to her patroness when it pleased her to talk; and to play interminable games of cribbage with her when she was tired of talking. All these things were a labour of love to Rhoda. And Mrs. Errington was kind to the girl in her own way. \n \n And above all, was not Algy there? Those were happy days in the Welsh village. On the long delicious summer afternoons, when Mrs. Errington was asleep after dinner, Rhoda would sit out of doors with her sewing; on a bench under the parlour window, so as to be within call of her patroness; and Algy would lounge beside her with a book; or make short excursions to get her wild flowers, which he would toss into her lap, laughing at her ecstasy of gratitude. \"Oh, Algy!\" she would cry, \"Oh, how good of you! How lovely they are!\" The words written down are not eloquent, but Rhoda\u0027s looks and tones made them so. \n \n \"They are not half so lovely,\" Algy would answer, \"as properly educated garden flowers; nor so sweet either. But I know you like that sort of herbage.\" \n \n Rhoda never forgot those days. How should she forget them?—since it was at this period that Algernon first discovered that he was in love with her. Perhaps he might never have made the discovery if they had all stayed at Whitford. There he saw her, as he had seen her since her childhood, surrounded by coarse common people, and living their life, more or less. It is not every one who can be expected to recognise your diamond, if you set it in lead. Rhoda was always sweet, always gentle, always pretty, but she formed part and parcel of old Max\u0027s establishment. When the boy and girl were quite small, she used to help him with his lessons (her one year\u0027s seniority made a greater difference between them then, than it did later) and had always been used to do him sisterly service in a hundred ways. And all this was by no means favourable to the young gentleman\u0027s falling in love with her. \n \n But at Llanryddan, Rhoda appeared under quite a different aspect. She looked prettier than ever before, Algernon thought. And perhaps she really was so; for there is no such cosmetic for the complexion as happiness. Apart from her vulgar relations, and treated as a lady by the few strangers with whom they came in contact, it was surprising to find how good her manners were, and how much natural grace she possessed. Mrs. Errington had taught her what may be termed the technicalities of polite behaviour. From her own heart and native sensibility she had learnt the essentials. The people in the village turned their heads to admire her, as she walked modestly along. Who could help admiring her? Algernon decided that there was not one among the young ladies of Whitford who could compare with Rhoda. \"She is ten times as pretty as those raw-boned McDougalls, and twenty times as well bred as Alethea Dockett, and ever so much cleverer than Miss Pawkins,\" he reflected. Minnie Bodkin never came into his head in the list of damsels with whom Rhoda could be compared. Minnie occupied a place apart, quite removed from any idea of love-making. \n \n Dear Little Rhoda! How fond she was of him! \n \n Altogether Rhoda appeared in a new light, and the new light became her mightily. Yes; Algy was certainly in love with her, he acknowledged to himself. There was no scene, no declaration. It all came to pass very gradually. In Rhoda the sense of this love stole on as subtly as the dawn. Before she had begun to watch the glowing streaks of rose-colour, it was daylight! And then how warm and golden it grew in her little world! How the birds chirped and fluttered, and the flowers breathed sweet breath, and a thousand diamond drops stood on the humblest blades of grass! \n \n If she had been nine years old, instead of nearly nineteen, she could scarcely have given less heed to the worldly aspects of the situation. \n \n Algernon perhaps more consciously set aside considerations of the future. He was but a boy, however; and he always had a great gift of enjoying the present moment, and sending Janus-headed Care, that looks forward and backward, to the deuce. As yet there was no Lord Seely on his horizon; no London society; no diplomatic career. The latter indeed was but an Ancramism of his mother\u0027s, when she spoke of it to Mr. Diamond, and Algy at that time had never entertained the idea of it. \n \n So these two young persons sat side by side, on the bench outside the Welsh cottage, and were as happy as the midsummer days were long. \n \n But long as the midsummer days were, they passed. Then came the time for going back to Whitford. The day before their return home Rhoda received a shock of pain—the first, but not the last, which she ever felt from this love of hers—at these words, said carelessly, but in a low voice, by Algy, as he lounged at her side, watching the sunset: \n \n \"Rhoda, darling, you must not say a word to any one about—about you and me, you know.\" \n \n Not say a word! What had she to say? And to whom? \"No, Algy,\" she answered, in a faint little voice, and began to meditate. The idea had been presented to her for the first time that it was her duty, or Algy\u0027s duty, to drag their secret from its home in Fairyland, and subject it to the eyes and tongues of mortals. But being once there, the idea stayed in her mind and would not be banished. Her father—Mrs. Errington—what would they say if they knew that—that she had dared to love Algernon? The future began to look terribly hard to her. The glittering mist which had hidden it was drawn away like a gauze curtain. How could she not have seen it all before? Would any one believe for evermore that she had been such a child, such a fool, so selfishly absorbed in her pleasant day-dreams, as not to calculate the cost of it for one moment until now? \n \n \"Oh, Algy!\" the poor child broke out, lifting a pale face and startled eyes to his; \"if we could only go on for ever as we are! If it would be always summer, and we two could stay in this village, and never go back, or see any of the people again—except father,\" she added hastily. And a pang of remorse smote her as her conscience told her that the father who loved her so well, and was so good to her, whatever he might be to others, was not at all necessary to the happiness of her existence henceforward. \n \n \"Don\u0027t let\u0027s be miserable now, at all events,\" returned Algernon cheerfully. \"Look at that purple bar of cloud on the gold! I wonder if I could paint that. I wish I had my colour-box here. The pencil sketches are so dreary after all that colour.\" \n \n Rhoda had no doubt that Algernon could paint \"that,\" or anything else he applied his brush to. After a while she said, with her heart beating violently, and the colour coming and going in her cheeks: \"Don\u0027t you think it would be wrong, deceitful—to—if we—not to tell——\" Poor Rhoda could not frame her sentence, and was obliged to leave it unfinished. \n \n \"Deceitful! Am I generally deceitful, Rhoda? Oh, I say, don\u0027t cry; there\u0027s a pet! Don\u0027t, my darling! I can\u0027t bear to see you sorry. But, look here, Rhoda, dear; I\u0027m so young yet, that it wouldn\u0027t do to talk about being in love, or anything of that sort. Though I know I shall never change, they would declare I didn\u0027t know my own mind, and would make a joke of it\"—this shot told with Rhoda, who shrank from ridicule, as a sensitive plant shrinks from the north wind—\"and bother my—our lives out. Can\u0027t you see old Grimgriffin\u0027s great front teeth grinning at us?\" \n \n It was in these terms that Algy was wont to allude to that respectable spinster, Miss Elizabeth Grimshaw. \n \n Rhoda knew that Algy wished and expected her to smile when he said that; and she tried to please him, but the smile would not come. Her lip quivered, and tears began to gather in her eyes again. She would have sobbed outright if she had tried to speak. The more she thought the sadder and more frightened she grew. Ridicule was painful, but that was not the worst. Her father! Mrs. Errington! She lay awake half the night, terrifying herself with imaginations of their wrath. \n \n Algy found an opportunity the next morning to whisper to her a few words. \"Don\u0027t look so melancholy, Rhoda. They\u0027ll wonder at Whitford what\u0027s the matter if you go back with such a wan face. And as to what you said about deceit, why we shan\u0027t pretend not to love each other! Look here, we must have patience! I shall always love you, darling, and I\u0027m sure to get my own way with my mother in the long run; I always do.\" \n \n So then there would be obstacles to contend with on Mrs. Errington\u0027s part, and Algy acknowledged that there would. Of course she had known before that it must be so. But Algy had declared that he would always love her; that was the one comforting thought to which she clung. Rhoda had grown from a child to a woman since yesterday. Algy was only older by four-and-twenty hours. \n \n After their return to Whitford came Mr. Filthorpe\u0027s letter. Then his mother\u0027s application to Lady Seely, brought about by an old acquaintance of Mrs. Errington, who lived in London, and kept up an intermittent correspondence with her. Both these events were talked over in Rhoda\u0027s presence. Indeed, the girl filled the part towards Mrs. Errington that the confidant enacts towards the prima donna in an Italian opera. Mrs. Errington was always singing scenas to her, which, so far as Rhoda\u0027s share in them went, might just as well have been uttered in the shape of a soliloquy. But the lady was used to her confidant, and liked to have her near, to take her hand in the impressive passages, and to walk up the stage with her during the symphony. \n \n So Rhoda heard Algernon\u0027s prospects canvassed. In her heart she longed that he should accept Mr. Filthorpe\u0027s offer. It would keep him nearer to her in every sense. She had few opportunities of talking with him alone now—far fewer than at dear Llanryddan; but she was able to say a few words privately to him one afternoon (the very afternoon of Dr. Bodkin\u0027s whist-party), and she timidly hinted that if Algy went to Bristol, instead of to London amongst all those great folks, she would not feel that she had lost him so completely. \n \n \"My dear child!\" exclaimed Algy, whose outlook on life had a good deal changed during the last three months, \"how can you talk so? Fancy me on Filthorpe\u0027s office stool!\" \n \n \"London is such a long way off, Algy,\" murmured the girl plaintively. \"And then, amongst all those grand people, lords and ladies, you—you may grow different.\" \n \n \"Upon my word, my dear Rhoda, your appreciation of me is highly flattering! For my part it seems to me more likely that I should grow \u0027different\u0027 in the society of Bristol tradesmen than amongst my own kith and kin—people like myself and my parents in education and manners. I am a gentleman, Rhoda. Lord Seely is not more.\" \n \n Rhoda shrank back abashed before this magnificent young gentleman. Such a flourish was very unusual in Algernon. But the Ancram strain in him had been asserting itself lately. He was sorry when he saw the poor girl\u0027s hurt look and downcast eyes, from which the big tears were silently falling one by one. He took her in his arms, and kissed her pale cheeks, and brought a blush on to them, and an April smile to her lips; and called her his own dear pretty Rhoda, whom he could never, never forget. \n \n \"Perhaps it would be best to forget me, Algy,\" she faltered. And although his loving words, and flatteries, and caresses, were inexpressibly sweet to her, the pain remained at her heart. \n \n She never again ventured to say a word to him about his plans. She would listen, meekly and admiringly, to his vivid pictures of all the fine things he was to do in the future: pictures in which her figure appeared—like the donor of a great altarpiece, full of splendid saints and golden-crowned angels—kneeling in one corner. And she would sit in silent anguish whilst Mrs. Errington expatiated on her son\u0027s prospects; wherein, of late, a \"great alliance\" played a large part. But she could not rouse herself to elation or enthusiasm. This mattered little to Mrs. Errington, who only required her confidante to stand tolerably still with her back to the audience. But it worried Algernon to see Rhoda\u0027s sad, downcast face, irresponsive to any of his bright anticipations. It must be owned that the young fellow\u0027s position was not entirely pleasant. Yet his admirable temper and spirits scarcely flagged. He was never cross, except, now and then, just a very little to his mother. And if no one else in the world less deserved his ill-humour, at least no one else in the world was so absolutely certain to forgive him for it! \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2168/61267.html","bookId":444,"book":{"id":444,"title":"A Charming Fellow","description":"简介： The room was very quiet.
