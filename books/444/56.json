{"id":21658,"no":56,"title":"CHAPTER XX.","content":"It was past mid-day when a loud peal at the bell of Ivy Lodge startled the women in the kitchen. Polly ran to the front door to open it. There stood her master, who pushed quickly into the house past her. \"Is your mistress come back?\" he asked almost breathlessly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, sir! Oh, mercy me, what\u0027s the matter? What has happened?\" she cried, for his face showed undisguised terror and agitation. He sat down in the dining-room and asked for a glass of wine. Having drunk it at a gulp, he said, \"I cannot understand it. I have been nearly to Whitford along the meadow-path; I didn\u0027t try the other way, but then she would not have wandered towards Duckwell, surely! Then I crossed the fields and came back by the road, looking everywhere, and asking every one I met. Nothing to be seen of her. Your mistress\u0027s manner has been so strange of late. You must have noticed it. I—I—am afraid—I cannot help being afraid that some terrible thing has happened to her. I have had a dreadful weight and presentiment on my mind all the morning. Where can she be?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh no, no, sir. Never fear! She\u0027ll be all safe somewheres or other. She\u0027ll just have gone wandering on into the town. She have been strange in her ways, poor thing! and we couldn\u0027t but see it, sir. But she can\u0027t have come to no harm. There\u0027s nothing to hurt her here-about.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Thus honest Polly, consolingly. But she was infected, too, by the terror in her master\u0027s white face. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You don\u0027t know,\" said he tremulously, \"what reason I have for uneasiness.\" He drew out from his pocket-book a torn scrap of paper with some writing on it. \"I found this on the floor by her desk this morning. This is what alarmed me so before I went out, but I wouldn\u0027t say anything about it then.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Polly stared at the paper with eager curiosity, but the sharp, slanting writing puzzled her eyes, never quite at their ease with the alphabet in any shape. \"Is it missus\u0027s writing?\" she asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes; see, she talks of being so wretched. Why, God knows! Her mind has been quite unhinged. That is the only explanation. And, you see, she says, \u0027It will not be long before this misery is at an end. I cannot live on as I am living. I will not.\u0027\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Lord, ha\u0027 mercy upon us!\" ejaculated the woman, on whom the full force of her master\u0027s anxiety and alarm suddenly broke. Her round ruddy cheeks grew almost as white as his, and Lydia, who had been peeping and listening at the door, burst out crying, and began uttering a series of incoherent phrases. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hold your noise!\" said Polly roughly. \"There\u0027s troubles enough without you. Now look ye here, sir. I\u0027ll put on my bonnet and go right down into Whitford. You take a look along Whit Meadow up Duckwell way. I bet ten pounds she\u0027s there somewhere\u0027s about. She has taken to going about through the fields, hasn\u0027t she, Lydia? Oh, hold your noise, and try and do something to help, you whimpering fool!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Polly\u0027s violent excitement and trepidation took a practical form, whilst the other woman was utterly helpless. She was bidden to stay at home and \"receive missus,\" and tell her that master was come back, and beg her \"to bide still in the house, until he should return.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But I\u0027m afraid she\u0027ll never come back!\" sobbed Lydia. \"I\u0027m so frightened to stop here by myself.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ugh, you great silly! Haven\u0027t you got no feeling for the poor husband? He looks scared well-nigh to death, poor lad. And as for you, it ain\u0027t much you care what\u0027s become of missus. You never had a good word for her. You\u0027re only crying because you\u0027re a coward.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Meanwhile Algernon sat in the little dining-room, with a strange sensation, as if every muscle in his body had been turned into lead. He must get up, and go out as the woman had said. He must! But there he sat with that sensation of marvellous weight holding him down in his chair. The house was absolutely still. Lydia, unable to remain alone in the kitchen, had gone to stand at the front door and stare up and down the road. Thus she heard nothing of footsteps approaching the house at the back, coming hurriedly through the garden, and pausing at the threshold of the door, which was open. \\n\\n \\n\\n Presently, after some muttered conversation, in which two or three voices took part, a man entered the house and came along the passage, looking, as he went, into the kitchen and finding no one. Just as he reached the door of the dining-room, Algernon came out and confronted him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There\u0027s been an accident, sir, I\u0027m sorry to say,\" said the man. \"The alarm was given up our way about an hour and a half ago. Somebody\u0027s fallen into the Whit. I\u0027m very sorry, sir, but I\u0027m afraid you must prepare for bad news.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Whilst he was still speaking, the house had filled with an ever-gathering crowd. People stood in the passage, peeping over each other\u0027s shoulders, and pushing to get a glimpse of Algernon. There were even faces pressed to the windows outside, and the garden was blocked up. Polly had come hurrying back from the town, and now elbowed her way through the crowd to her master. She soon cleared the passage of the throng of idlers who blocked it up, and shut them outside the door by main force. They still swarmed about the house and garden, both on the side of the road and that of Whit Meadow. And their numbers increased every minute. Polly pulled the man who had been spokesman into the dining-room, and bade him say what he had to say without further preamble. \"It\u0027s no use \u0027preparing\u0027 him,\" she said, pointing to Algernon, who had sunk into a chair, and was holding his forehead with his hands; \"you\u0027ll only make it worse. I\u0027m afraid you can\u0027t tell him anything dreadfuller than he\u0027s got into his head already. Speak out!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Thus requested, the man, a carpenter of Pudcombe village, told his tale. Some men, working in the fields about a mile above Whitford—half a mile, perhaps, from Ivy Lodge, had heard cries for help from the meadows near the river. He, the carpenter, happened to be passing along a field path from a farmhouse where he had been at work, and ran with the labourers down to the water\u0027s edge. There they saw David Powell, the Methodist preacher, wildly shouting for help, and with clothes dripping wet. He had waded waist-deep into the Whit to try to save some one who was drowning there, but in vain. He could not swim, and the current had carried the drowning person out of his reach. \"You know,\" said the carpenter, \"there are some ugly swirls and currents in the Whit, for all it looks so sluggish.\" A boat had been got out and manned, and had made all speed in the direction Powell pointed out. He insisted on accompanying them in his wet clothes. They searched the river for some time in vain. They had got as far as Duckwell Reach when they caught sight of a dark object close in shore. It was the form of a woman. Her clothes had caught in the broken stump of an old willow that grew half in the water; and she was thus held there, swinging to and fro with the current. She was taken out and carried to Duckwell Farm, where every effort had been made to restore her to consciousness. Powell understood the best methods to employ. The Seth Maxfields had done everything in their power, but it was no use. She had never moved, nor breathed, nor quivered an eyelash. \\n\\n \\n\\n That was the substance of the carpenter\u0027s story. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Is she dead?\" asked Algernon with his face hidden. They were the first words he had spoken. And when the man answered with a mournful but positive \"Yes; quite, quite dead,\" he said not a syllable further, but turned away from them, and buried his head in the cushions of the chair. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He hasn\u0027t even asked who the woman was!\" whispered the carpenter to Polly. The tears were streaming down the woman\u0027s cheeks. Castalia had not made herself beloved in her own house, but Polly had felt the sort of regard for her which grows by acts of kindness, and forbearance and compassion, performed. She shook her head, and answered in an equally low tone, \"No need for him to ask, poor young fellow. We\u0027ve all been fearing something dreadful about missus all morning. And he had his reasons for being afraid as she had gone and done something desperate.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What—you don\u0027t mean that she made away with herself?\" said the carpenter, raising his hands. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, that\u0027s more than you and I know. Best say nothing. How can we judge? Poor soul! Well, I always did feel sorry for her, and that I\u0027ll say. Though, mind you, I\u0027m sorry for him too. But there\u0027s some folks as can\u0027t stroke the dog without kicking the cat.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The news spread rapidly through Whitford, and caused the utmost excitement there. Mrs. Algernon Errington had been found drowned in the Whit. How—whether by accident or design—no one knew. But that did not prevent people from hazarding a thousand conjectures. She had wandered out alone, had ventured too near the edge of the slippery bank, and had lost her footing. She had been robbed and thrown into the river. She had committed suicide from ungovernable jealousy. She had committed suicide in a fit of insanity. She had become a hypochondriac. She had gone raving mad. She had committed various frauds at the post-office, and had killed herself in terror at the prospect of their coming to light. This latter hypothesis found much credence. So many circumstances—trifling, perhaps, in themselves, but important when massed together—seemed to corroborate it. And then, if that did not seem an adequate motive for the desperate deed, Castalia\u0027s notorious and passionate jealousy was thrown in as a make-weight. There would be a coroner\u0027s inquest, of course. And the chief witness at it would probably be David Powell. It appeared he was the last person who had seen the unfortunate woman alive. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Thimbleby was in terrible affliction. Mr. Powell was very ill. He had plunged into the ice-cold river, and had then remained for hours in his wet clothes. He had not been able to walk back from Duckwell Farm, and Farmer Maxfield had brought him home himself in his spring-cart, and had bidden widow Thimbleby look after him a little, for he (Maxfield) thought the preacher in a very bad way. He was seized with violent fits of shivering, and the doctor whom Mrs. Thimbleby sent for to see him, on her own responsibility, told them to get him into bed at once, to keep him warm, and to administer certain remedies which he ordered. But no word would Powell speak about his ailments to the doctor, or to anyone else. He waved off all questions with a determined though gentle resolution. He allowed himself to be helped into bed, being absolutely unable to stand or walk without assistance. And he did not refuse the warm clothing which the widow heaped upon him. He lay still and passive, but he would say no word of his symptoms and sensations to the doctor. \"The man can in no wise help me,\" he said to Mrs. Thimbleby. \"All the wisdom of this world is foolishness to one whom the Lord has laid his hands on. I am bowed as a reed; yea, I am broken.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n His voice was hoarse and feeble, and his eyes blazed with a feverish light. The widow found it vain to importune him to swallow the medicines that had been sent. In her heart she had some misgivings that it might be wrong to interfere in the dealings of Providence with so holy a man, by administering drugs to him. But the misgivings never reached a point of conviction that might have comforted her. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll leave you quiet awhile, Mr. Powell,\" she said. \"Maybe you\u0027ll sleep, and that would do you more good than anything. Sleep is God\u0027s own cure for a many troubles, isn\u0027t it?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He looked at her with a wild unrecognising stare. \"When I say my bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my complaint, then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through visions,\" he murmured. \\n\\n \\n\\n The good woman softly went away, wiping the tears from her eyes. \"One thing is a mercy,\" said the poor soul to herself, \"and that is, that Mr. Diamond is so kind and thoughtful. He gives no trouble, and is a help on the contrary. And I\u0027m sure I don\u0027t know how we should have managed without his arm to help Mr. Powell upstairs. And another thing is a mercy—I hope it isn\u0027t wrong to feel it so!—that Mrs. Errington is out of the house. I do not know how I should have been strengthened to keep up and attend upon her, and she in such a way, poor thing! The Lord has had pity on us for Mr. Powell\u0027s sake.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Minnie Bodkin had driven to Mrs. Thimbleby\u0027s house early in the afternoon, and taken Mrs. Errington away with her. Mrs. Errington had rushed to Ivy Lodge under the first shock of the terrible news which Mr. Smith, the surgeon, communicated to her. She had seen her son for a few minutes. Her intention had been to remain with him, but this he would not allow. He had insisted on his mother\u0027s returning to her own lodgings after a very brief interview with him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No wonder he can\u0027t bear to have her about, though she is his mother. Tiresome old thing!\" exclaimed Lydia, peevishly. \\n\\n \\n\\n But if Algernon got rid of his mother as quickly as possible, he refused to admit any one else at all, and remained shut up in the dining-room, whither he had had a sofa carried, meaning to sleep there. He had been obliged to receive Seth Maxfield, who came to ask when and how he would wish his wife\u0027s body conveyed from Duckwell Farm to Whitford. \"Can\u0027t she stay there?\" he had asked in a dazed sort of manner. Then added quickly, turning away his head, \"I\u0027ll leave it all to you. You\u0027ve been very good. You\u0027ve done everything for the best, I am sure.\" And he put out his hand to the farmer with his face still turned away. And later on he had had to see some officials about the inquest. But after that was over, he locked his door, and refused to open it except to Polly, when she brought him food. He ate almost ravenously, drank a great deal of wine, and then lay down and dozed away the hours until dawn next day. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2168/61317.html","bookId":444,"book":{"id":444,"title":"A Charming Fellow","description":"简介： The room was very quiet.
