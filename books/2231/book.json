{"id":2231,"title":"The Last Dance","description":"Storyline: In this city, you can get anything done for a price. If you want someone\u0027s eyeglasses smashed, it\u0027ll cost you a subway token. You want his fingernails pulled out? His legs broken? You want him hurt so bad he\u0027s an invalid his whole life? You want him...killed? Let me talk to someone. It can be done. The hanging death of a nondescript old man in a shabby little apartment in a meager section of the 87th Precinct is nothing much in this city, especially to detectives Carella and Meyer. But everyone has a story, and this old man\u0027s story stood to make some people a lot of money. His story takes Carella, Meyer, Brown, and Weeks on a search through Isola\u0027s seedy strip clubs and to the bright lights of the theater district. There they discover an upcoming musical with ties to a mysterious drug -- and a killer who stays until the last dance.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-last-dance.jpg","author":"Ed McBain","type":"Thriller","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","category":{"id":12,"name":"Thriller","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
