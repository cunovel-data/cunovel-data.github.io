Asimov\u0027s Three Laws of Robotics were programmed into real computers thirty years ago at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology - with surprising results. Readers of today still have many surprises in store...\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-complete-robot-robot-0-3.jpg","author":"Isaac Asimov","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":32,"category":{"id":7,"name":"Science Fiction","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
