{"id":70073,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"I have written stories about computers, as well as about roots. In fact, I have computers (or something pretty close to computers) in some stories that are always thought of as robot stories. You\u0027ll see computers (after a fashion) in \"Robbie,\" \"Escape!\" and \"The Evitable Conflict\" later in this volume. In this volume, however, I am sticking to robots and, in general, ignoring my computer stories. On the other hand, it is not always easy to decide where the dividing line is. A robot is, in some ways, merely a mobile robot. So for this group, I selected three computer stories in which the computer seemed to be sufficiently intelligent and to have sufficient personality to be indistinguishable from a robot. Furthermore, all three stories did not appear in earlier collections of mine, and Doubleday wanted some uncollected stories present so that the completists who had all my earlier collections would have something new to slaver over. Point of View Roger came looking for his father, partly because it was Sunday, and by rights his father shouldn\u0027t have been at work, and Roger wanted to be sure that everything was all right. Roger\u0027s father wasn\u0027t hard to find, because all the people who worked with Multivac, the giant computer, lived with their families right on the grounds. They made up a little city by themselves, a city of people that solved all the world\u0027s problems. The Sunday receptionist knew Roger. \"If you\u0027re after your father,\" she said, \"he\u0027s down Corridor L, but he may be too busy to see you. Roger tried anyway, poking his head past one of the doors where he heard the noise of men and women. The corridors were a lot emptier than on weekdays, so it was easy to find where the people were working. He saw his father at once, and his father saw him. His father didn\u0027t look happy and Roger decided at once that everything wasn\u0027t all right. \"Well, Roger,\" said his father. \"I\u0027m busy, I\u0027m afraid.\" Roger\u0027s father\u0027s boss was there, too, and he said, \"Come on, Atkins, take a break. You\u0027ve been at this thing for nine hours and you\u0027re not doing us any good anymore. Take the kid for a bite at the commissary. Take a nap and then come back.\" Roger\u0027s father didn\u0027t look as if he wanted to. He had an instrument in his hand that Roger knew was a current-pattern analyzer, though he didn\u0027t know how it worked. Roger could hear Multivac chuckling and whirring all about. But then Roger\u0027s father put down the analyzer. \"Okay. Come on, Roger. I\u0027ll race you for a hamburger and we\u0027ll let these wise guys here try and find out what\u0027s wrong without me.\" He stopped a while to wash up and then they were in the commissary with big hamburgers in front of them and french fries and soda pop. Roger said, \"Is Multivac out of order still, Dad?\" His father said gloomily, \"We\u0027re not getting anywhere, I\u0027ll tell you that.\" \"It seemed to be working. I mean, I could hear it.\" \"Oh, sure, it\u0027s working. It just doesn\u0027t always give the right answers.\" Roger was thirteen and he\u0027d been taking computer-programming since the fourth grade. He hated it sometimes and wished he lived back in the 20th Century, when kids didn\u0027t use to take it-but it was helpful sometimes in talking to his father. Roger said, \"How can you tell it doesn\u0027t always give the right answers, if only Multivac knows the answers?\" His father shrugged and for a minute Roger was afraid he would just say it was too hard to explain and not talk about it-but he almost never did that. His father said, \"Son, Multivac may have a brain as large as a big factory, but it still isn\u0027t as complicated as the one we have here,\" and he tapped his head. \"Sometimes, Multivac gives us an answer we couldn\u0027t calculate for ourselves in a thousand years, but just the same something clicks in our brains and we say, \u0027Whoa! Something\u0027s wrong here!\u0027 Then we ask Multivac again and we get a different answer. If Multivac were right, you see, we should always get the same answer to the same question. When we get different answers, one of them is wrong. \" And the thing is, son, how do we know we always catch Multivac? How do we know that some of the wrong answers don\u0027t get past us? We may rely on some answer and do something that may turn out disastrously five years from now. Something\u0027s wrong inside Multivac and we can\u0027t find out what. And whatever is wrong is getting worse.\" \"Why should it be getting worse?\"\u0027 asked Roger. His father had finished his hamburger and was eating the french fries one by one. \"My feeling is. Son,\u0027 he said, thoughtfully, \"that we\u0027ve made Multivac the wrong smartness.\" \"Huh?\" \"You see, Roger, if Multivac were as smart as a man, we could talk to it and find out what was wrong no matter how complicated it was. If it were as dumb as a machine, it would go wrong in simple ways that we could catch easily. The trouble is, it\u0027s half-smart, like an idiot. It\u0027s smart enough to go wrong in very complicated ways, but not smart enough to help us find out what\u0027s wrong.-And that\u0027s the wrong smartness.\" He looked very gloomy. \"But what can we do? We don\u0027t know how to make it smarter-not yet. And we don\u0027t dare make it dumber either, because the world\u0027s problems have become so serious and the questions we ask are so complicated that it takes all Multivac\u0027s smartness to answer them. It would be a disaster to have him dumber.\u0027\" \"If you shut down Multivac,\" said Roger, \"and went over him really carefully-\" \"We can\u0027t do that, son,\" said his father. \"I\u0027m afraid Multivac must be in operation every minute of the day and night. We\u0027ve got a big back-log of problems.\" \"But if Multivac continues to make mistakes. Dad, won\u0027t it have to be shut down? If you can\u0027t trust what it says-\" \"Well,\" Roger\u0027s father ruffled Roger\u0027s hair, \"we\u0027ll find out what\u0027s wrong, old sport, don\u0027t worry.\" But his eyes looked worried just the same. \"Come on, let\u0027s finish and we\u0027ll get out of here.\" \"But Dad,\" said Roger, \"listen. If Multivac is half-smart, why does that mean it\u0027s an idiot?\" \"If you knew the way we have to give it directions, son, you wouldn\u0027t ask.\" \"Just the same, Dad, maybe it\u0027s not the way to look at it. I\u0027m not as smart as you; I don\u0027t know as much; but I\u0027m not an idiot. Maybe Multivac isn\u0027t like an idiot, maybe it\u0027s like a kid.\" Roger\u0027s father laughed. \"That\u0027s an interesting point of view, but what difference does it make?\" \"It could make a lot of difference,\" said Roger. \"You\u0027re not an idiot, so you don\u0027t see how an idiot\u0027s mind would work; but I\u0027m a kid, and maybe I would know how a kid\u0027s mind would work.\" \"Oh? And how would a kid\u0027s mind work?\" \"Well, you say you\u0027ve got to keep Multivac busy day and night. A machine can do that. But if you give a kid homework and told him to do it for hours and hours, he\u0027d get pretty tired and feel rotten enough to make mistakes, maybe even on purpose.-So why not let Multivac take an hour or two off every day with no problem-solving-just letting it chuckle and whir by itself any way it wants to.\" Roger\u0027s father looked as if he were thinking very hard. He took out his pocket-computer and tried some combinations on it. He tried some more combinations. Then he said, \"You know, Roger, if I take what you said and turn it into Platt-integrals, it makes a kind of sense. And twenty-two hours we can be sure of is better than twenty-four that might be all wrong.\" He nodded his head, but then he looked up from his pocket-computer and suddenly asked, as though Roger were the expert, \"Roger, are you sure?\" Roger was sure. He said, \"Dad, a kid\u0027s got to play, too.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-complete-robot-robot-0-3/page-5.html","bookId":1740,"book":{"id":1740,"title":"The Complete Robot (Robot #0.3)","description":"Storyline: The Complete Robot (Robot 0.3) THE COMPLETE ROBOT is the definitive anthology of Asimov\u0027s stunning visions of a robotic futureâ€¦ In these stories, Isaac Asimov creates the Three Laws of Robotics and ushers in the Robot Age: when Earth is ruled by master-machines and when robots are more human than mankind. As well as TN-3 (Tony), AL-76 and other robots, the stories feature the staff of US Robots and Mechanical Men Inc., and in particular the chief robot-psychologist, the steely Dr Susan Calvin who is in many ways more robot-like than her subjects. THE COMPLETE ROBOT is the ultimate collection of timeless, amazing and amusing robot stories from the greatest science fiction writer of all time, offering golden insights into robot thought processes.
