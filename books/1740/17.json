{"id":70085,"no":17,"title":"Page 17","content":"Powell and Donovan The second robot story I wrote, \"Reason\" (included in this section), dealt with the two field-testers, Gregory Powell and Michael Donovan. They were modeled on certain stories John Campbell wrote, which I admired extravagantly, about a pair of interplanetary explorers, Penton and Blake. If Campbell ever noted the similarity, he said nothing about it to me. By the way, I must warn you that the first story in this section, \"First Law,\" was written as a spoof and is not meant to be taken seriously. First Law Mike Donovan looked at his empty beer mug, felt bored, and decided he had listened long enough. He said, loudly, \"If we\u0027re going to talk about unusual robots, I once knew one that disobeyed the First Law.\" And since that was completely impossible, everyone stopped talking and turned to look at Donovan. Donovan regretted his big mouth at once and changed the subject. \"I heard a good one yesterday,\" he said, conversationally, \"about-\" MacFarlane in the chair next to Donovan\u0027s said, \"You mean you knew a robot that harmed a human being?\" That was what disobedience to First Law meant, of course. \"In a way,\" said Donovan. \"I say I heard one about-\" \"Tell us about it,\" ordered MacFarlane. Some of the others banged their beer mugs on the table. Donovan made the best of it. \"It happened on Titan about ten years ago,\" he said, thinking rapidly. \"Yes, it was in twenty-five. We had just recently received a shipment of three new-model robots, specially designed for Titan. They were the first of the MA models. We called them Emma One, Two and Three.\" He snapped his fingers for another beer and stared earnestly after the waiter. Let\u0027s see, what came next? MacFarlane said, \"I\u0027ve been in robotics half my life, Mike. I never heard of an MA serial order.\" \"That\u0027s because they took the MA\u0027s off the assembly lines immediately after-after what I\u0027m going to tell you. Don\u0027t you remember?\" \"No.\" Donovan continued hastily. \"We put the robots to work at once. You see, until then, the Base had been entirely useless during the stormy season, which lasts eighty percent of Titan\u0027s revolution about Saturn. During the terrific snows, you couldn\u0027t find the Base if it were only a hundred yards away. Compasses aren\u0027t any use, because Titan hasn\u0027t any magnetic field. \"The virtue of these MA robots, however, was that they were equipped with vibro-detectors of a new design so that they could make a beeline for the Base through anything, and that meant mining could become a through-the-revolution affair. And don\u0027t say a word, Mac. The vibro-detectors were taken off the market also, and that\u0027s why you haven\u0027t heard of them.\" Donovan coughed. \"Military secret, you understand.\" He went on. \"The robots worked fine during the first stormy season, then at the start of the calm season, Emma Two began acting up. She kept wandering off into corners and under bales and had to be coaxed out. Finally she wandered off Base altogether and didn\u0027t come back. We decided there had been a flaw in her manufacture and got along with the other two. Still, it meant we were shorthanded, or short-roboted anyway, so when toward the end of the calm season, someone had to go to Kornsk, I volunteered to chance it without a robot. It seemed safe enough; the storms weren\u0027t due for two days and I\u0027d be back in twenty hours at the outside. \"I was on the way back-a good ten miles from Base-when the wind started blowing and the air thickening. I landed my air car immediately before the wind could smash it, pointed myself toward the Base and started running. I could run the distance in the low gravity all right, but could I run a straight line? That was the question. My air supply was ample and my suit heat coils were satisfactory, but ten miles in a Titanian storm is infinity. \"Then, when the snow streams changed everything to a dark, gooey twilight, with even Saturn dimmed out and the sun only a pale pimple, I stopped short and leaned against the wind. There was a little dark object right ahead of me. I could barely make it out but I knew what it was. It was a storm pup; the only living thing that could stand a Titanian storm, and the most vicious living thing anywhere. I knew my space suit wouldn\u0027t protect me, once it made for me, and in the bad light, I had to wait for a point-blank aim or I didn\u0027t dare shoot. One miss and he would be at me. \"I backed away slowly and the shadow followed. It closed in and I was raising my blaster, with a prayer, when a bigger shadow loomed over me suddenly, and I yodeled with relief. It was Emma Two, the missing MA robot. I never stopped to wonder what had happened to it or worry why it had. I just howled, \u0027Emma, baby, get that storm pup; and then get me back to Base.\u0027 \"It just looked at me as if it hadn\u0027t heard and called out, \u0027Master, don\u0027t shoot. Don\u0027t shoot.\u0027 \"It made for that storm pup at a dead run. \" \u0027Get that damned pup, Emma,\u0027 I shouted. It got the pup, all right. It scooped it right up and kept on going. I yelled myself hoarse but it never came back. It left me to die in the storm.\" Donovan paused dramatically, \"Of course, you know the First Law: A robot may not injure a human being, or through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm! Well, Emma Two just ran off with that storm pup and left me to die. It broke First Law. \"Luckily, I pulled through safely. Half an hour later, the storm died down. It had been a premature gust, and a temporary one. That happens sometimes. I hot-footed it for Base and the storms really broke next day. Emma Two returned two hours after I did, and, of course, the mystery was then explained and the MA models were taken off the market immediately.\" \"And just what,\" demanded MacFarlane, \"was the explanation?\" Donovan regarded him seriously. \"It\u0027s true I was a human being in danger of death, Mac, but to that robot there was something else that came first, even before me, before the First Law. Don\u0027t forget these robots were of the MA series and this particular MA robot had been searching out private nooks for some time before disappearing. It was as though it expected something special-and private-to happen to it. Apparently, something special had.\" Donovan\u0027s eyes turned upward reverently and his voice trembled. \"That storm pup was no storm pup. We named it Emma Junior when Emma Two brought it back. Emma Two had to protect it from my gun. What is even First Law compared with the holy ties of mother love?\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-complete-robot-robot-0-3/page-17.html","bookId":1740,"book":{"id":1740,"title":"The Complete Robot (Robot #0.3)","description":"Storyline: The Complete Robot (Robot 0.3) THE COMPLETE ROBOT is the definitive anthology of Asimov\u0027s stunning visions of a robotic futureâ€¦ In these stories, Isaac Asimov creates the Three Laws of Robotics and ushers in the Robot Age: when Earth is ruled by master-machines and when robots are more human than mankind. As well as TN-3 (Tony), AL-76 and other robots, the stories feature the staff of US Robots and Mechanical Men Inc., and in particular the chief robot-psychologist, the steely Dr Susan Calvin who is in many ways more robot-like than her subjects. THE COMPLETE ROBOT is the ultimate collection of timeless, amazing and amusing robot stories from the greatest science fiction writer of all time, offering golden insights into robot thought processes. Asimov\u0027s Three Laws of Robotics were programmed into real computers thirty years ago at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology - with surprising results. Readers of today still have many surprises in store...","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-complete-robot-robot-0-3.jpg","author":"Isaac Asimov","type":"Science Fiction","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-complete-robot-robot-0-3.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:55 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:15:05 AM"}}
