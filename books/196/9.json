{"id":6147,"no":9,"title":"Chapter 9 The Ball","content":"\u0027Now, Miss Grey,\u0027 exclaimed Miss Murray, immediately I entered the schoolroom, after having taken off my outdoor garments, upon returning from my four weeks\u0027 recreation, \u0027Now--shut the door, and sit down, and I\u0027ll tell you all about the ball.\u0027\n \u0027No--damn it, no!\u0027 shouted Miss Matilda. \u0027Hold your tongue, can\u0027t ye? and let me tell her about my new mare--SUCH a splendour, Miss Grey! a fine blood mare--\u0027\n \u0027Do be quiet, Matilda; and let me tell my news first.\u0027\n \u0027No, no, Rosalie; you\u0027ll be such a damned long time over it--she shall hear me first--I\u0027ll be hanged if she doesn\u0027t!\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m sorry to hear, Miss Matilda, that you\u0027ve not got rid of that shocking habit yet.\u0027\n \u0027Well, I can\u0027t help it: but I\u0027ll never say a wicked word again, if you\u0027ll only listen to me, and tell Rosalie to hold her confounded tongue.\u0027\n Rosalie remonstrated, and I thought I should have been torn in pieces between them; but Miss Matilda having the loudest voice, her sister at length gave in, and suffered her to tell her story first: so I was doomed to hear a long account of her splendid mare, its breeding and pedigree, its paces, its action, its spirit, \u0026c., and of her own amazing skill and courage in riding it; concluding with an assertion that she could clear a five-barred gate \u0027like winking,\u0027 that papa said she might hunt the next time the hounds met, and mamma had ordered a bright scarlet hunting-habit for her.\n \u0027Oh, Matilda! what stories you are telling!\u0027 exclaimed her sister.\n \u0027Well,\u0027 answered she, no whit abashed, \u0027I know I COULD clear a five-barred gate, if I tried, and papa WILL say I may hunt, and mamma WILL order the habit when I ask it.\u0027\n \u0027Well, now get along,\u0027 replied Miss Murray; \u0027and do, dear Matilda, try to be a little more lady-like. Miss Grey, I wish you would tell her not to use such shocking words; she will call her horse a mare: it is so inconceivably shocking! and then she uses such dreadful expressions in describing it: she must have learned it from the grooms. It nearly puts me into fits when she begins.\u0027\n \u0027I learned it from papa, you ass! and his jolly friends,\u0027 said the young lady, vigorously cracking a hunting-whip, which she habitually carried in her hand. \u0027I\u0027m as good judge of horseflesh as the best of \u0027m.\u0027\n \u0027Well, now get along, you shocking girl! I really shall take a fit if you go on in such a way. And now, Miss Grey, attend to me; I\u0027m going to tell you about the ball. You must be dying to hear about it, I know. Oh, SUCH a ball! You never saw or heard, or read, or dreamt of anything like it in all your life. The decorations, the entertainment, the supper, the music were indescribable! and then the guests! There were two noblemen, three baronets, and five titled ladies, and other ladies and gentlemen innumerable. The ladies, of course, were of no consequence to me, except to put me in a good humour with myself, by showing how ugly and awkward most of them were; and the best, mamma told me,--the most transcendent beauties among them, were nothing to me. As for me, Miss Grey--I\u0027m so SORRY you didn\u0027t see me! I was CHARMING--wasn\u0027t I, Matilda?\u0027\n \u0027Middling.\u0027\n \u0027No, but I really was--at least so mamma said--and Brown and Williamson. Brown said she was sure no gentleman could set eyes on me without falling in love that minute; and so I may be allowed to be a little vain. I know you think me a shocking, conceited, frivolous girl; but then, you know, I don\u0027t attribute it ALL to my personal attractions: I give some praise to the hairdresser, and some to my exquisitely lovely dress--you must see it to-morrow-- white gauze over pink satin--and so SWEETLY made! and a necklace and bracelet of beautiful, large pearls!\u0027\n \u0027I have no doubt you looked very charming: but should that delight you so very much?\u0027\n \u0027Oh, no!--not that alone: but, then, I was so much admired; and I made so MANY conquests in that one night--you\u0027d be astonished to hear--\u0027\n \u0027But what good will they do you?\u0027\n \u0027What good! Think of any woman asking that!\u0027\n \u0027Well, I should think one conquest would be enough; and too much, unless the subjugation were mutual.\u0027\n \u0027Oh, but you know I never agree with you on those points. Now, wait a bit, and I\u0027ll tell you my principal admirers--those who made themselves very conspicuous that night and after: for I\u0027ve been to two parties since. Unfortunately the two noblemen, Lord G--- and Lord F---, were married, or I might have condescended to be particularly gracious to THEM; as it was, I did not: though Lord F---, who hates his wife, was evidently much struck with me. He asked me to dance with him twice--he is a charming dancer, by-the- by, and so am I: you can\u0027t think how well I did--I was astonished at myself. My lord was very complimentary too--rather too much so in fact--and I thought proper to be a little haughty and repellent; but I had the pleasure of seeing his nasty, cross wife ready to perish with spite and vexation--\u0027\n \u0027Oh, Miss Murray! you don\u0027t mean to say that such a thing could really give you pleasure? However cross or--\u0027\n \u0027Well, I know it\u0027s very wrong;--but never mind! I mean to be good some time--only don\u0027t preach now, there\u0027s a good creature. I haven\u0027t told you half yet. Let me see. Oh! I was going to tell you how many unmistakeable admirers I had:- Sir Thomas Ashby was one,--Sir Hugh Meltham and Sir Broadley Wilson are old codgers, only fit companions for papa and mamma. Sir Thomas is young, rich, and gay; but an ugly beast, nevertheless: however, mamma says I should not mind that after a few months\u0027 acquaintance. Then, there was Henry Meltham, Sir Hugh\u0027s younger son; rather good-looking, and a pleasant fellow to flirt with: but BEING a younger son, that is all he is good for; then there was young Mr. Green, rich enough, but of no family, and a great stupid fellow, a mere country booby! and then, our good rector, Mr. Hatfield: an HUMBLE admirer he ought to consider himself; but I fear he has forgotten to number humility among his stock of Christian virtues.\u0027\n \u0027Was Mr. Hatfield at the ball?\u0027\n \u0027Yes, to be sure. Did you think he was too good to go?\u0027\n \u0027I thought be might consider it unclerical.\u0027\n \u0027By no means. He did not profane his cloth by dancing; but it was with difficulty he could refrain, poor man: he looked as if he were dying to ask my hand just for ONE set; and--oh! by-the-by-- he\u0027s got a new curate: that seedy old fellow Mr. Bligh has got his long-wished-for living at last, and is gone.\u0027\n \u0027And what is the new one like?\u0027\n \u0027Oh, SUCH a beast! Weston his name is. I can give you his description in three words--an insensate, ugly, stupid blockhead. That\u0027s four, but no matter--enough of HIM now.\u0027\n Then she returned to the ball, and gave me a further account of her deportment there, and at the several parties she had since attended; and further particulars respecting Sir Thomas Ashby and Messrs. Meltham, Green, and Hatfield, and the ineffaceable impression she had wrought upon each of them.\n \u0027Well, which of the four do you like best?\u0027 said I, suppressing my third or fourth yawn.\n \u0027I detest them all!\u0027 replied she, shaking her bright ringlets in vivacious scorn.\n \u0027That means, I suppose, \"I like them all\"--but which most?\u0027\n \u0027No, I really detest them all; but Harry Meltham is the handsomest and most amusing, and Mr. Hatfield the cleverest, Sir Thomas the wickedest, and Mr. Green the most stupid. But the one I\u0027m to have, I suppose, if I\u0027m doomed to have any of them, is Sir Thomas Ashby.\u0027\n \u0027Surely not, if he\u0027s so wicked, and if you dislike him?\u0027\n \u0027Oh, I don\u0027t mind his being wicked: he\u0027s all the better for that; and as for disliking him--I shouldn\u0027t greatly object to being Lady Ashby of Ashby Park, if I must marry. But if I could be always young, I would be always single. I should like to enjoy myself thoroughly, and coquet with all the world, till I am on the verge of being called an old maid; and then, to escape the infamy of that, after having made ten thousand conquests, to break all their hearts save one, by marrying some high-born, rich, indulgent husband, whom, on the other hand, fifty ladies were dying to have.\u0027\n \u0027Well, as long as you entertain these views, keep single by all means, and never marry at all: not even to escape the infamy of old-maidenhood.\u0027\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/285/2644.html","bookId":196,"book":{"id":196,"title":"阿格尼斯.格雷 Agnes Grey","description":"简介： Agnes Grey is the debut novel of English author Anne Bront?, first published in 1847, and republished in a second edition in 1850.
