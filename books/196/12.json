{"id":6150,"no":12,"title":"Chapter 12 The Shower","content":"The next visit I paid to Nancy Brown was in the second week in March: for, though I had many spare minutes during the day, I seldom could look upon an hour as entirely my own; since, where everything was left to the caprices of Miss Matilda and her sister, there could be no order or regularity. Whatever occupation I chose, when not actually busied about them or their concerns, I had, as it were, to keep my loins girded, my shoes on my feet, and my staff in my hand; for not to be immediately forthcoming when called for, was regarded as a grave and inexcusable offence: not only by my pupils and their mother, but by the very servant, who came in breathless haste to call me, exclaiming, \u0027You\u0027re to go to the schoolroom DIRECTLY, mum, the young ladies is WAITING!!\u0027 Climax of horror! actually waiting for their governess!!!\n But this time I was pretty sure of an hour or two to myself; for Matilda was preparing for a long ride, and Rosalie was dressing for a dinner-party at Lady Ashby\u0027s: so I took the opportunity of repairing to the widow\u0027s cottage, where I found her in some anxiety about her cat, which had been absent all day. I comforted her with as many anecdotes of that animal\u0027s roving propensities as I could recollect. \u0027I\u0027m feared o\u0027 th\u0027 gamekeepers,\u0027 said she: \u0027that\u0027s all \u0027at I think on. If th\u0027 young gentlemen had been at home, I should a\u0027 thought they\u0027d been setting their dogs at her, an\u0027 worried her, poor thing, as they did MANY a poor thing\u0027s cat; but I haven\u0027t that to be feared on now.\u0027 Nancy\u0027s eyes were better, but still far from well: she had been trying to make a Sunday shirt for her son, but told me she could only bear to do a little bit at it now and then, so that it progressed but slowly, though the poor lad wanted it sadly. So I proposed to help her a little, after I had read to her, for I had plenty of time that evening, and need not return till dusk. She thankfully accepted the offer. \u0027An\u0027 you\u0027ll be a bit o\u0027 company for me too, Miss,\u0027 said she; \u0027I like as I feel lonesome without my cat.\u0027 But when I had finished reading, and done the half of a seam, with Nancy\u0027s capacious brass thimble fitted on to my finger by means of a roll of paper, I was disturbed by the entrance of Mr. Weston, with the identical cat in his arms. I now saw that he could smile, and very pleasantly too.\n \u0027I\u0027ve done you a piece of good service, Nancy,\u0027 he began: then seeing me, he acknowledged my presence by a slight bow. I should have been invisible to Hatfield, or any other gentleman of those parts. \u0027I\u0027ve delivered your cat,\u0027 he continued, \u0027from the hands, or rather the gun, of Mr. Murray\u0027s gamekeeper.\u0027\n \u0027God bless you, sir!\u0027 cried the grateful old woman, ready to weep for joy as she received her favourite from his arms.\n \u0027Take care of it,\u0027 said he, \u0027and don\u0027t let it go near the rabbit- warren, for the gamekeeper swears he\u0027ll shoot it if he sees it there again: he would have done so to-day, if I had not been in time to stop him. I believe it is raining, Miss Grey,\u0027 added he, more quietly, observing that I had put aside my work, and was preparing to depart. \u0027Don\u0027t let me disturb you--I shan\u0027t stay two minutes.\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027ll BOTH stay while this shower gets owered,\u0027 said Nancy, as she stirred the fire, and placed another chair beside it; \u0027what! there\u0027s room for all.\u0027\n \u0027I can see better here, thank you, Nancy,\u0027 replied I, taking my work to the window, where she had the goodness to suffer me to remain unmolested, while she got a brush to remove the cat\u0027s hairs from Mr. Weston\u0027s coat, carefully wiped the rain from his hat, and gave the cat its supper, busily talking all the time: now thanking her clerical friend for what he had done; now wondering how the cat had found out the warren; and now lamenting the probable consequences of such a discovery. He listened with a quiet, good- natured smile, and at length took a seat in compliance with her pressing invitations, but repeated that he did not mean to stay.\n \u0027I have another place to go to,\u0027 said he, \u0027and I see\u0027 (glancing at the book on the table) \u0027someone else has been reading to you.\u0027\n \u0027Yes, sir; Miss Grey has been as kind as read me a chapter; an\u0027 now she\u0027s helping me with a shirt for our Bill--but I\u0027m feared she\u0027ll be cold there. Won\u0027t you come to th\u0027 fire, Miss?\u0027\n \u0027No, thank you, Nancy, I\u0027m quite warm. I must go as soon as this shower is over.\u0027\n \u0027Oh, Miss! You said you could stop while dusk!\u0027 cried the provoking old woman, and Mr. Weston seized his hat.\n \u0027Nay, sir,\u0027 exclaimed she, \u0027pray don\u0027t go now, while it rains so fast.\u0027\n \u0027But it strikes me I\u0027m keeping your visitor away from the fire.\u0027\n \u0027No, you\u0027re not, Mr. Weston,\u0027 replied I, hoping there was no harm in a falsehood of that description.\n \u0027No, sure!\u0027 cried Nancy. \u0027What, there\u0027s lots o\u0027 room!\u0027\n \u0027Miss Grey,\u0027 said he, half-jestingly, as if he felt it necessary to change the present subject, whether he had anything particular to say or not, \u0027I wish you would make my peace with the squire, when you see him. He was by when I rescued Nancy\u0027s cat, and did not quite approve of the deed. I told him I thought he might better spare all his rabbits than she her cat, for which audacious assertion he treated me to some rather ungentlemanly language; and I fear I retorted a trifle too warmly.\u0027\n \u0027Oh, lawful sir! I hope you didn\u0027t fall out wi\u0027 th\u0027 maister for sake o\u0027 my cat! he cannot bide answering again--can th\u0027 maister.\u0027\n \u0027Oh! it\u0027s no matter, Nancy: I don\u0027t care about it, really; I said nothing VERY uncivil; and I suppose Mr. Murray is accustomed to use rather strong language when he\u0027s heated.\u0027\n \u0027Ay, sir: it\u0027s a pity.\u0027\n \u0027And now, I really must go. I have to visit a place a mile beyond this; and you would not have me to return in the dark: besides, it has nearly done raining now--so good-evening, Nancy. Good-evening, Miss Grey.\u0027\n \u0027Good-evening, Mr. Weston; but don\u0027t depend upon me for making your peace with Mr. Murray, for I never see him--to speak to.\u0027\n \u0027Don\u0027t you; it can\u0027t be helped then,\u0027 replied he, in dolorous resignation: then, with a peculiar half-smile, he added, \u0027But never mind; I imagine the squire has more to apologise for than I;\u0027 and left the cottage.\n I went on with my sewing as long as I could see, and then bade Nancy good-evening; checking her too lively gratitude by the undeniable assurance that I had only done for her what she would have done for me, if she had been in my place and I in hers. I hastened back to Horton Lodge, where, having entered the schoolroom, I found the tea-table all in confusion, the tray flooded with slops, and Miss Matilda in a most ferocious humour.\n \u0027Miss Grey, whatever have you been about? I\u0027ve had tea half an hour ago, and had to make it myself, and drink it all alone! I wish you would come in sooner!\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ve been to see Nancy Brown. I thought you would not be back from your ride.\u0027\n \u0027How could I ride in the rain, I should like to know. That damned pelting shower was vexatious enough--coming on when I was just in full swing: and then to come and find nobody in to tea! and you know I can\u0027t make the tea as I like it.\u0027\n \u0027I didn\u0027t think of the shower,\u0027 replied I (and, indeed, the thought of its driving her home had never entered my head).\n \u0027No, of course; you were under shelter yourself, and you never thought of other people.\u0027\n I bore her coarse reproaches with astonishing equanimity, even with cheerfulness; for I was sensible that I had done more good to Nancy Brown than harm to her: and perhaps some other thoughts assisted to keep up my spirits, and impart a relish to the cup of cold, overdrawn tea, and a charm to the otherwise unsightly table; and--I had almost said--to Miss Matilda\u0027s unamiable face. But she soon betook herself to the stables, and left me to the quiet enjoyment of my solitary meal.\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/285/2647.html","bookId":196,"book":{"id":196,"title":"阿格尼斯.格雷 Agnes Grey","description":"简介： Agnes Grey is the debut novel of English author Anne Bront?, first published in 1847, and republished in a second edition in 1850.
