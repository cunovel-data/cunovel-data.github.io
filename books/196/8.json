{"id":6146,"no":8,"title":"Chapter 8 The \u0027Coming OUt\u0027","content":"At eighteen, Miss Murray was to emerge from the quiet obscurity of the schoolroom into the full blaze of the fashionable world--as much of it, at least, as could be had out of London; for her papa could not be persuaded to leave his rural pleasures and pursuits, even for a few weeks\u0027 residence in town. She was to make her debut on the third of January, at a magnificent ball, which her mamma proposed to give to all the nobility and choice gentry of O--- and its neighbourhood for twenty miles round. Of course, she looked forward to it with the wildest impatience, and the most extravagant anticipations of delight. \u0027Miss Grey,\u0027 said she, one evening, a month before the all- important day, as I was perusing a long and extremely interesting letter of my sister\u0027s--which I had just glanced at in the morning to see that it contained no very bad news, and kept till now, unable before to find a quiet moment for reading it,--\u0027Miss Grey, do put away that dull, stupid letter, and listen to me! I\u0027m sure my talk must be far more amusing than that.\u0027 She seated herself on the low stool at my feet; and I, suppressing a sigh of vexation, began to fold up the epistle. \u0027You should tell the good people at home not to bore you with such long letters,\u0027 said she; \u0027and, above all, do bid them write on proper note-paper, and not on those great vulgar sheets. You should see the charming little lady-like notes mamma writes to her friends.\u0027 \u0027The good people at home,\u0027 replied I, \u0027know very well that the longer their letters are, the better I like them. I should be very sorry to receive a charming little lady-like note from any of them; and I thought you were too much of a lady yourself, Miss Murray, to talk about the \"vulgarity\" of writing on a large sheet of paper.\u0027 \u0027Well, I only said it to tease you. But now I want to talk about the ball; and to tell you that you positively must put off your holidays till it is over.\u0027 \u0027Why so?--I shall not be present at the ball.\u0027 \u0027No, but you will see the rooms decked out before it begins, and hear the music, and, above all, see me in my splendid new dress. I shall be so charming, you\u0027ll be ready to worship me--you really must stay.\u0027 \u0027I should like to see you very much; but I shall have many opportunities of seeing you equally charming, on the occasion of some of the numberless balls and parties that are to be, and I cannot disappoint my friends by postponing my return so long.\u0027 \u0027Oh, never mind your friends! Tell them we won\u0027t let you go.\u0027 \u0027But, to say the truth, it would be a disappointment to myself: I long to see them as much as they to see me--perhaps more.\u0027 \u0027Well, but it is such a short time.\u0027 \u0027Nearly a fortnight by my computation; and, besides, I cannot bear the thoughts of a Christmas spent from home: and, moreover, my sister is going to be married.\u0027 \u0027Is she--when?\u0027 \u0027Not till next month; but I want to be there to assist her in making preparations, and to make the best of her company while we have her.\u0027 \u0027Why didn\u0027t you tell me before?\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ve only got the news in this letter, which you stigmatize as dull and stupid, and won\u0027t let me read.\u0027 \u0027To whom is she to be married?\u0027 \u0027To Mr. Richardson, the vicar of a neighbouring parish.\u0027 \u0027Is he rich?\u0027 \u0027No; only comfortable.\u0027 \u0027Is he handsome?\u0027 \u0027No; only decent.\u0027 \u0027Young?\u0027 \u0027No; only middling.\u0027 \u0027Oh, mercy! what a wretch! What sort of a house is it?\u0027 \u0027A quiet little vicarage, with an ivy-clad porch, an old-fashioned garden, and--\u0027 \u0027Oh, stop!--you\u0027ll make me sick. How CAN she bear it?\u0027 \u0027I expect she\u0027ll not only be able to bear it, but to be very happy. You did not ask me if Mr. Richardson were a good, wise, or amiable man; I could have answered Yes, to all these questions--at least so Mary thinks, and I hope she will not find herself mistaken.\u0027 \u0027But--miserable creature! how can she think of spending her life there, cooped up with that nasty old man; and no hope of change?\u0027 \u0027He is not old: he\u0027s only six or seven and thirty; and she herself is twenty-eight, and as sober as if she were fifty.\u0027 \u0027Oh! that\u0027s better then--they\u0027re well matched; but do they call him the \"worthy vicar\"?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know; but if they do, I believe he merits the epithet.\u0027 \u0027Mercy, how shocking! and will she wear a white apron and make pies and puddings?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know about the white apron, but I dare say she will make pies and puddings now and then; but that will be no great hardship, as she has done it before.\u0027 \u0027And will she go about in a plain shawl, and a large straw bonnet, carrying tracts and bone soup to her husband\u0027s poor parishioners?\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m not clear about that; but I dare say she will do her best to make them comfortable in body and mind, in accordance with our mother\u0027s example.\u0027","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/285/2643.html","bookId":196,"book":{"id":196,"title":"阿格尼斯.格雷 Agnes Grey","description":"简介： Agnes Grey is the debut novel of English author Anne Bront?, first published in 1847, and republished in a second edition in 1850.
