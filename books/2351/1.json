{"id":66796,"no":1,"title":"Page 1","content":"1. Charles Brown, the defense attorney, was a small man with a round head. He was wearing a brown and orange zigzagged power tie. I secretly wondered if he went by Charlie as a kid and had a dog named Snoopy and a crush on the little red-headed girl. We were sitting in my office on a warm spring day. Charlie was here to give me a job if I wanted it, and I wanted it. I hadn\u0027t worked in two weeks and was beginning to like it, which made me nervous. \"I think the kid\u0027s innocent,\" he was saying. \"Of course you do, Charlie. You\u0027re a defense attorney. You would find cause to think Jack the Ripper was simply a misunderstood artist before his time.\" He looked at me with what was supposed to be a stern face. \"The name\u0027s Charles,\" he said. \"If you say so.\" \"I do.\" \"Glad that\u0027s cleared up.\" \"I heard you could be difficult,\" he said. \"Is this you being difficult? If so, then I\u0027m disappointed.\" I smiled. \"Maybe you have me confused with my father.\" Charlie sat back in my client chair and smiled. His domed head was perfectly buffed and polished, cleanly reflecting the halogen lighting above. His skin appeared wet and viscous, as if his sweat glands were ready to spring into action at a moment\u0027s notice. \"Your father has quite a reputation in L.A. I gave his office a call before coming here. Of course, he\u0027s quite busy and could not take on an extra case.\" \"So you settled on the next best thing.\" \"If you want to call it that,\" he said. \"I\u0027ve heard that you\u0027ve performed adequately with similar cases, and so I\u0027ve decided to give you a shot, although my expectations are not very high, and I have another P.I. waiting in the wings.\" \"How reassuring,\" I said. \"Yeah, well, he\u0027s established. You\u0027re not.\" \"But can he pick up a blind side blitz?\" Charlie smiled and splayed his stubby fingers flat on my desk and looked around my office, which was adorned with newspaper clippings and photographs of yours truly. Most of the photographs depict me in a Bruin uniform, sporting the number 45. In most I\u0027m carrying the football, and in others I\u0027m blowing open the hole for the tailback. Or at least I like to think I\u0027m blowing open the hole. The newspapers are yellowing now, taped or tacked to the wood paneling. Maybe someday I\u0027ll take them down. But not yet. \"You beat SC a few years back. I can never forgive you for that. Two touchdowns in the fourth quarter alone.\" \"Three,\" I said. \"But who\u0027s counting?\" He rubbed his chin. \"Destroyed your leg, if I recall, in the last game of the season. Broken in seven different places.\" \"Nine, but who\u0027s counting?\" \"Must have been hard to deal with. You were on your way to the pros. Would have made a hell of a fullback.\" That had been hard to deal with, and I didn\u0027t feel like talking about it now to Charlie Brown. \"Why do you believe in your client\u0027s innocence?\" I asked. He looked at me. \"I see. You don\u0027t want to talk about it. Sorry I brought it up.\" He crossed his legs. He didn\u0027t seem sorry at all. He looked smugly down at his shoes, which had polish on the polish. \"Because I believe Derrick\u0027s story. I believe he loved his girlfriend and would never kill her.\" \"People have been killed for love before. Nothing new.\" On my computer screen before me I had brought up an article from the Orange County Register. The article showed a black teen being led away into a police car. He was looking down, his head partially covered by his jacket. He was being led away from a local high school. A very upscale high school, if I recalled. The story was dated three weeks ago, and I recalled reading it back then. I tapped the computer monitor. \"The police say there\u0027s some indication that his girlfriend was seeing someone else, and that jealousy might have been a factor.\" \"Yes,\" said the attorney. \"And we think this someone else framed our client.\" \"I take it you want me to find this man.\" \"Or person.\" \"Ah, equality,\" I said. \"We want you to find evidence of our client\u0027s innocence, whether or not you find the true murderer.\" \"Anything else I should know?\" \"We feel race might be a factor here. He was the only black student in school, and in the neighborhood.\" \"I believe the preferred term is African-American.\" \"I\u0027m aware of public sentiment in this regards. I don\u0027t need you to lecture me.\" \"Just trying to live up to my difficult name.\" \"Yeah, well, cool it,\" he said. \"Now, no one\u0027s talking at the school. My client says he was working out late in the school gym, yet no one saw him, not even the janitors.\" \"Then maybe he wasn\u0027t there.\" \"He was there,\" said Charlie simply, as if his word was enough. \"So do you want the job?\" \"Sure.\" We discussed a retainer fee and then he wrote me a check. When he left, waddling out of the office, I could almost hear Schroeder playing on his little piano in the background. 2. \"He was found with the murder weapon,\" said Detective Hanson. \"It was in the backseat of his car. That\u0027s damning evidence.\" \"That,\" I said, \"and he\u0027s black.\" \"And he\u0027s black,\" said Hanson. \"In an all white school,\" I said. \"Yep.\" \"Were his prints on the knife?\" \"No.\" We were sitting in an outdoor cafe facing the beach. It was spring, and in southern California that\u0027s as good as summer. Many underdressed women were roller-blading, jogging or walking their dogs on the narrow beach path. There were also some men, all finely chiseled, but they were not as interesting. Detective Hanson was a big man, but not as big as me. He had neat brown hair parted down the middle. His thick mustache screamed cop. He wore slacks and a white shirt. He was sweating through his shirt. I was dressed in khaki shorts, a surfing T-shirt and white Vans. Coupled with my amazing tan and disarming smile, I was surprised I wasn\u0027t more often confused with Jimmy Buffet. If Jimmy Buffet stood six foot four and weighed two hundred and twenty. \"You guys have anything else on the kid?\" I asked. \"You know I can\u0027t divulge that. Trial hasn\u0027t even started. The info about the knife made it to the press long ago, so that\u0027s a freebie for you. I can tell you this: the body was found at one a.m., although the ME places the time of death around seven p.m. the previous night.\" \"Who found the body?\" \"A neighbor.\" \"Where were the victim\u0027s parents?\" \"Dinner and dancing. It was a Friday night.\" \"Of course,\" I said. \"Who doesn\u0027t go out and dance on a Friday night?\" \"I don\u0027t,\" said Hanson. \"Me neither,\" I said. \"Does Derrick have an alibi?\" \"This will cost you a tunacoda.\" \"You drive a hard bargain.\" I called the waitress over and put in our lunch orders. \"No alibi,\" Hanson said when she had left, \"but....\" He let his voice trail off. \"But you believe the kid?\" He shrugged. \"Yeah. He seems like a good kid. Says he was working out at the school gym at the time.\" \"Schools have janitors, staff, students.\" \"Yeah, well, it was late and no one saw him.\" \"Or no one chose to see him.\" Hanson shrugged. Our food arrived. A tunacoda for the detective. A half pound burger for me, with grilled onions and cheese, and a milkshake. \"You trying to commit suicide?\" he asked. \"I\u0027m bulking up,\" I said. \"This is how you bulk up? Eating crap?\" \"Only way I know how.\" \"Why?\" \"Thinking of trying out for San Diego,\" I said. \"The Chargers?\" \"Yeah.\" \"What about your leg?\" \"The leg\u0027s going to be a problem.\" He thought about that, working his way through his tuna and avocado sandwich. He took a sip from his Coke. \"You wanna bash heads with other men and snap each other in the shower with jock straps, go right ahead.\" \"It\u0027s not as glamorous as that.\" \"Suicide, I say. What\u0027s your dad think?\" \"He doesn\u0027t know. You\u0027re the first person I\u0027ve told.\" \"I\u0027m honored.\" \"You should be.\" \"What\u0027s Cindy going to say?\" I sipped my milkshake. \"She won\u0027t like it, but she will support me. She happens to think very highly of me and my decisions.\" He snorted and finished his sandwich, grabbed his Styrofoam cup. \"I can\u0027t believe I was bribed with a shitty tuna sandwich and a Coke.\" \"A simple man with simple needs.\" \"I should resent that remark, if it wasn\u0027t so true.\" He stood. \"I gotta run. Good luck with the kid, but I think it\u0027s a lost cause. Kid even has a record.\" \"What kind?\" \"Vandalism, mostly. He\u0027s a goner. Hear they\u0027re gonna try him as an adult.\" Detective Hanson left with his Styrofoam cup. I noticed he wasn\u0027t wearing socks. Even cops in Huntington Beach are cool.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dark-horse-jim-knighthorse-1/page-1.html","bookId":2351,"book":{"id":2351,"title":"Dark Horse (Jim Knighthorse #1)","description":"Storyline: Dark Horse (Jim Knighthorse #1) When high school student Derrick Booker, the only black student at a posh Orange County high school, is accused of killing his white girlfriend, ex-college football hero and detective Jim Knighthorse is hired to dig a little deeper into the murder.
