{"id":97580,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"Valas peered down at the expanse of dark water below him. Lake Tho-root was even larger than he\u0027d been told - so wide that the far side of it was lost in darkness. It reminded him of the wide, flat expanse of An-auroch, the desert they\u0027d recently visited. The difference, however, was that the lake had steep cliffs hemming it in on every side, a waterfall that thundered into it from the cavern whereValas perched, and a high, domed ceiling overhead. Enormous stalactites hung from that ceiling. Some had points that touched the water; others were broken off like jagged teeth, making the cavern look like an enormous, ranged mouth. Valas shivered, hoping it wasn\u0027t an omen of what was to come.\\n\\n A hand touched his shoulder. Turning, he saw Pharaun. Danifae was right behind him.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s wrong?\" the mage asked.\\n\\n \"Nothing,\" Valas answered. \"It\u0027s just the spray from the waterfall. I\u0027m chilled.\"\\n\\n Quenthel scrambled up behind Pharaun and Danifae - who backed away, one wary eye on the whip in Quenthel\u0027s belt. Quenthel wascrouching to negotiate the low ceiling, her hands and feet spread wide to keep her balance on the slippery rocks. That and the hungry gleam in her eye made her look like a dark spider. Jeggred was one pace behind her, as usual, moving nimbly across the uneven ledge, his second, smaller set of arms held out for balance.\\n\\n Quenthel peered into the vast cavern beyond the waterfall and asked, \"Have we reached Lake Thoroot?\"\\n\\n Her voice was barely audible over the roar of falling water.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s just below,\" Valas answered with a nod. \"About fifty paces straight down.\"\\n\\n \"Do you see any sign of the city - or the ship?\"\\n\\n Valas shook his head and replied, \"Both are probably far beneath the surface.\"\\n\\n But which part of the surface? he wondered.\\n\\n For all Valas knew, Zanhoriloch was on the far side of the lake, though he wasn\u0027t about to admit that to Quenthel. They had en-tered through the only approach to the lake the scout was familiar with. The last thing he wanted was to exhibit any weakness or uncer-tainty, even after they found the ship and left the Underdark - and his expertise - behind.\\n\\n One hand clutching the wet rock beside him, Valas leaned as far out as he dared, studying the wall below. The tunnel they\u0027d been following was a wide one, with a natural ledge of rock on one side of the river. It had provided a welcome shortcut to the lake, an easy trek after their long, weary journey. But from there, things got tricky. The river burst out of the tunnel like a hori-zontal fountain, its spray soaking the rock for a great distance on either side. Through the mist, Valas could see faintly glowing streaks of green against the stone: patches of water-soaked, slip-peryfungi.\\n\\n Valas felt someone looming behind him, and fetid breath told him who it was. Jeggred stared out at the lake, his monstrous body crowding Valas and nearly forcing him over the edge.\\n\\n Elbowing Jeggred back, Valas shouted back to the others over the draegloth\u0027s head, \"I\u0027d like to scout ahead before we go any farther. Pharaun, I\u0027ll need magic to climb down, and that spell of yours that will allow me to breathe underwater.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re going alone?\" the mage asked. \"Shouldn\u0027t you take someone with you?\" He glanced past Quenthel as if anticipating someone else to materialize behind her, then he sighed. \"What about Jeggred?\"\\n\\n \"No!\" Quenthel barked, the vipers in her whip lashing. \"Jeggred stays with me.\"\\n\\n Sensing her anger, Jeggred scrambled over to crouch at her side.\\n\\n \"He can take Danifae,\" Quenthel said.\\n\\n Before Valas could shake his head in protest, Pharaun butted in.\\n\\n \"Danifae will only slow him down - and I don\u0027t want to waste my time and talents preparing the same spells twice.\"\\n\\n Valas glanced between Quenthel and Pharaun. Valas had to tread carefully, so as not to tip the scales - a balancing act that was growing wearisome. It would be a relief to get away on his own for a while.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll go alone,\" he told them.\\n\\n The Bregan D\u0027aerthe scout took off hispiwafwi, then set his haversack, bow, and quiver beside it. He also shed his chain mail - its weight would only drag him to the bottom of the lake - and his boots. He carefully removed from his enchanted vest any of his many talismans that might be harmed by the water, then put the vest back on. Next he lashed his daggers into their sheaths. The thread he used would prevent them from falling out when he was underwater but was thin enough to be broken easily in an emergency.\\n\\n When he was done, he looked up at Pharaun and said, \"Ready.\"\\n\\n The mage nodded and pulled a small sheet of mushroom-skin paper from his pocket. Unfolding it, he handed its contents to Valas: a small blob of a black, tarry substance.\\n\\n \"Eat it,\" the wizard instructed.\\n\\n Without asking what it was, Valas popped it into his mouth. It had a bitter taste, and it stuck to his teeth. With an effort, Valas forced his jaws apart, unsticking his molars.\\n\\n Pharaun laughed and said, \"You don\u0027t have to chew it. Just swallow.\"\\n\\n Valas swallowed the substance, then stood waiting as Pharaun chanted the words to his spell. The mage ended by fluttering his fin-gers against Valas\u0027s chest, like a mother imitating a spider in a child\u0027s nursery rhyme. When Pharaun was done, the scout\u0027s fingers and toes felt gummy. He lifted onehand from the rock, and sticky strands of web followed it.\\n\\n Pharaun reached into a pocket of hispiwafwia second time and pulled out a short length of some kind of dried surface plant.\\n\\n \"Ready?\" he asked.\\n\\n Valas nodded.\\n\\n The mage grinned and said, \"Then rake a deep breath.\"\\n\\n Valas did, and Pharaun blow through the stick at him, complet-ing his second spell.\\n\\n Valas\u0027s chest felt heavy, and water trickled from his nostrils.\\n\\n \"Go!\" Pharaun shouted.\\n\\n Valas didn\u0027t need any urging. The pressure of the water that filled his lungs was incentive enough. Scrambling over the edge, he scurried down the cavern wall like a spider, his sticky hands and feet allowing him to crawl along the sheer cliff face. Head-down, he hur-ried toward the water, eyes squinted against the spray. Above him, the waterfall arced out and over, obscuring his view of the tunnel he\u0027d just left, it hit the water below in a thundering roar that grew louder as he descended.\\n\\n The scout was still a pace or two above the surface of the lake when the urge to breathe overcame him. Expelling the water in his lungs like a vomiting man, he tried to draw air - and nearly drowned.\\n\\n Sputtering, he at last reached the lake. As his head plunged be-neath the cold, choppy surface he drew in a great lungful of water and felt relief.\\n\\n He continued down, following the wall of stone until the churn-ing water washed the stickiness from his hands and feet. Pushing off from the wall, he swam, allowing the current caused by the water-fall to carry him deeper. The water was cold - and dark. He swam through it for some time without seeing anything, relying on his keen sense of direction to keep him oriented toward the middle of the lake. Pharaun\u0027s spell would enable him to keep breathing water for more than a cycle - he could rest on the bottom of the lake, if he needed to - but he hoped it wouldn\u0027t take him that long to find some sign of where the aboleth city was.\\n\\n After he swam, and rested, and swam a while longer, Valas saw a glow in the darkened water ahead. As he made his way toward it, the glow resolved itself into a pattern of tightly clustered, greenish-yellow globes that brightened and dimmed, brightened and dimmed.\\n\\n Are those the lights of Zanhoriloch? Valas thought as he stroked toward them, only to be disappointed as he drew near enough to see the lights more clearly.\\n\\n The glowing globes turned out not to be the lights of the abo-leth city but a school of luminescent jellyfish. There were hundreds of them, each the size of Valas\u0027s palm. They moved together, their tendrils contracting, then pulsing in unison, each pulse pumping up their light from greenish-yellow to yellow.\\n\\n Valas started to turn away, disappointed, when he spotted a sil-houette swimming between him and the jellyfish. The scout froze, not wanting to betrayhimself with movement. Drifting with the current, he hung in the water, watching.\\n\\n The silhouette was the same size as a drow and had two arms and two legs, each of which ended in a wide webbed hand or foot. It also had a fluked tail - but no tentacles. Definitely not an aboleth then . . . but what race was it?\\n\\n The creature swam beside the jellyfish, herding them with a staff it held in one hand. The head of the staff emitted crackling bursts of light whose frequency matched the pulsing of the jellyfish. Valas could just barely hear the sound that came from it, a low-pitchedthum, thum, thum, like the sound of a muted drum.\\n\\n Intent upon its glowing flock,the creature hadn\u0027t spotted Valas, which left the scout with a decision to make. He could approach and try to communicate, in the hope that the creature would tell him where Zanhoriloch was, or exercise his usual caution and swim away.\\n\\n He touched his star-shaped talisman, reassuring himself that it was still pinned to his shirt. If necessary, he could always use its magic to escape.\\n\\n He swam toward the creature.\\n\\n As he drew nearer he could see that it had skin as dark as a drow\u0027s. Its head was bald, and its body glistened in the light of the jellyfish. A layer of greenish slime covered its skin. When Valas was perhaps ten paces from it, the creature must have sensed his pres-ence. It turned with a sudden, whiplike flick of its tail. Seeing its face, Valas gasped. The high cheekbones and pointed jaw gave the creature a distinctively drow appearance. It even had red eyes, but no ears - or at least, only gnarled ridges around holes in its head that looked like the melted remains of ears. The thing\u0027s hands - one sculling back and forth, keeping the creature in place; the other holding the staff - had a thumb, but only two fingers, with a wide web of skin between them.\\n\\n Valas opened his mouth, then remembered he was breathing wa-ter and was unable to speak. On a whim, he tried drow sign language instead. He chose a carefully neutral message. He still didn\u0027t know if the creature was a friend or foe of either the drow or the aboleths.\\n\\n This is the lake of the aboleth, is it not?he asked.Is their city nearby?\\n\\n He didn\u0027t expect an answer. The scout who\u0027d told him about Lake Thoroot had said that only a handful of drow had ever ven-tured that way.\\n\\n Valas was shocked, then, when the creature replied in sign - albeit a sign that was made clumsy by his awkward, webbed fingers,You seek the aboleth? Are you insane? Go back, before they - \\n\\n The drow-thing convulsed as if it had been struck a blow. Releas-ing its staff it curled into a fetal position, webbed hands clutching its head, mouth open in a silent scream. Valas twisted around, reaching for his daggers as he searched for the threat, but before he could draw them a high-pitched scream pounded in through his skull.\\n\\n Louder than any noise he had ever experienced, the scream shat-tered thought and forced his body into spastic jerks. He found him-self curled in the same fetal position, eyes squeezed shut in a pained grimace and hands pressed over his ears.\\n\\n It didn\u0027t help. The scream continued, echoing against the inside of his skull until he was certain the bone would shatter like crystal. Then, mercifully, silence and darkness claimed him. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/extinction-war-of-the-spider-queen-4/page-10.html","bookId":2162,"book":{"id":2162,"title":"Extinction (War of the Spider Queen #4)","description":"Storyline: Extinction (Forgotten Realms: R.A.
