He had just asked if I was sure, and when I\u0027d said yes he had taken my bag and put it in the compartment of his bike before handing me a helmet and a leather jacket. I put both on. We had been riding for about two hours when he pulled into a gas station. My legs were slightly numb. I wasn\u0027t sure I could walk when I got off that thing. Tripp got off and then took my helmet and hung it on the bike. I didn\u0027t ask him why he wasn\u0027t wearing a helmet but I was glad he had one for me to wear. He then held his hand out to help me off. I managed to sling my leg over the bike and held on to both his hands as I stood up. \"Ouch,\" I said with a weak smile. He grinned. \"Yeah, you\u0027ll get used to it,\" he told me, then nodded his head toward the store. \"Go in, use the restroom, and get yourself something to eat and drink. We\u0027ll take a little break before we go any farther.\" I had focused on the road and the cars we passed. I\u0027d managed to fight off any thoughts of Woods. But they were there in my head, teasing me. They wanted to haunt me. They wanted to break me. He would know soon that I was gone. \"Where are we going?\" I asked, trying to think of anything other than Woods. \"Not sure. We\u0027re just riding. I thought you might need that right now. I\u0027m heading north. I figure we\u0027ll find somewhere interesting by bedtime to stop at.\" This was what I needed. I nodded. \"Okay.\" \"I gotta fill up,\" he told me, and I headed inside the store. I would need to call Braden now. I hadn\u0027t told her I was leaving Woods. She wouldn\u0027t have seen it my way. But once Woods knew I was gone he would call her first. She would be worried. I should prepare her. I slipped my phone out of my pocket and remembered I\u0027d had it switched off. I didn\u0027t want to be traceable. I would reactivate it in the next big city. A new number. One no one knew. After using the restroom I grabbed a bottle of water and some Cheetos, paid, and headed outside to sit at a picnic table that sat in a grassy area. Tripp glanced over at me before he went inside and did the same. By the time he came outside I was finished with my bag of Cheetos. He dropped a candy bar, a bag of peanuts, some beef jerky, and a bag of gummy worms on the table. \"Eat some more,\" he said before picking up the beef jerky and taking a bite of it. I reached for the candy bar and broke it in half before eating it. We ate in silence. I was afraid to try to talk to him. He wanted to know why I was doing this. He didn\u0027t think I should. I could tell by the way he was acting. \"He didn\u0027t know you were leaving. Didn\u0027t even have a clue. That sucks, Della. It really does. The dude\u0027s gonna take this real hard.\" I stopped eating and stood up. \"I can\u0027t think about that right now, okay? I need to think about other things. Not that. It\u0027s what was best for him. That\u0027s all I can tell you. Please, let\u0027s not talk about it.\" Tripp let out a weary sigh, then nodded. \"Fine. We won\u0027t talk about it. Not right now, anyway. Eat some worms, they\u0027re good for you,\" he said with a smirk as he pushed the bag of gummy worms toward me. \"I\u0027m not hungry.\" I wasn\u0027t. I felt sick now. \"Fine. I\u0027ll take this with us. You\u0027ll get hungry again soon. You barely ate anything.\" \"Can I use your phone to call my friend Braden?\" Tripp nodded and pulled his phone out of his pocket to hand it to me. \"Thanks,\" I replied as I took it from him. I walked far enough away that he wouldn\u0027t hear me. I was going to lie to Braden some, if only to keep her from telling Woods the truth. Dialing her number, I held my breath, hoping that I could find a way to tell her and make it believable. She would go straight to Woods with my location and reason for leaving if she knew the truth. \"Hello?\" Braden\u0027s voice sounded curious. She didn\u0027t recognize the number. \"It\u0027s me,\" I said into the phone. \"Della? Where are you?\" \"I\u0027m traveling the world. Living life. Woods\u0027s life isn\u0027t what I want for myself. I need adventure.\" Braden didn\u0027t respond. She was thinking. I knew the look on her face even though I couldn\u0027t see it. \"What happened? Stop bullshitting me and tell me where you are and what\u0027s wrong.\" I was a horrible liar and Braden knew me better than anyone. \"I\u0027m traveling. I\u0027m not alone and I\u0027m okay. I just need some time. I\u0027ll check in when I can but I need time to move on from things. This is why I got in your car and took off to begin with, anyway. Woods changed that but it was only temporary. I need to do this for me.\" \"I\u0027m still calling bullshit. I don\u0027t believe you but I won\u0027t push. Call me when you can, and be safe. Can I trust who you\u0027re with to keep you safe?\" \"Yes,\" I replied. \"You won\u0027t tell me who it is?\" \"No. I need you to not tell Woods that you talked to me. Tell him nothing. He will come after me and I don\u0027t want him to.\" Braden let out a small growl of frustration. \"He loves you, Della,\" she said. \"And I love him. But it\u0027s time I lived. I can\u0027t be locked up in that small town.\" \"I hope you\u0027re not making the biggest mistake of your life,\" she said in a defeated tone. \"It was the best chapter. I\u0027ll have more chapters though.\" \"I love you,\" Braden said. \"I love you, too,\" I replied. \"Call me soon.\" \"I will.\" I hung up and walked back over to Tripp, who was watching me. \"Thanks,\" I said, handing back his phone. \"Did you have yours turned off so he couldn\u0027t track you?\" he asked, standing up. I nodded. \"Damn, girl. You didn\u0027t leave the boy a bone, did you?\" \"Can we go? I just want to ride.\" \"Yeah, let\u0027s go,\" he said, and headed for the Harley parked near the table.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/simple-perfection-perfection-2/page-16.html","bookId":1992,"book":{"id":1992,"title":"Simple Perfection (Perfection #2)","description":"Storyline: Simple Perfection (Perfection #2) Woods had his perfect life mapped out for him.
