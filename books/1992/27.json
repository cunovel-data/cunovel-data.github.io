{"id":74318,"no":27,"title":"Page 27","content":"Woods The ringing was in the distance. I heard it but I couldn\u0027t find it. Everything was dark. My eyes snapped open and the ringing started again. Shit! It was my phone. I sat up and grabbed it. It was after three in the morning and Braden was calling me. Della. God, please let her be okay. \"Is she okay?\" I asked the moment I answered the phone. \"Yes and no.\" \"What does that mean?\" I asked, standing up and looking for my jeans. If I needed to go to her that night I would. \"She had a dream about her mother. She didn\u0027t wake up screaming. She just woke up.\" I stopped searching for my jeans. \"What?\" \"She had one of her dreams but she didn\u0027t have a night terror. She didn\u0027t get lost in her fears. She just woke up. She\u0027s already getting better.\" \"I\u0027m coming there. I\u0027ve had enough with waiting. I\u0027m on my way. Tonight.\" \"No! You\u0027re not. You have to give her time. She\u0027s meeting with her birth father next. She met with her birth mother and then had dinner with her family all on her own. She needs to do all this alone. She\u0027s realizing she can do this. She\u0027s also finding out that she was crippled by her fears. She\u0027s overcoming that. Don\u0027t come here and confuse her. She has to come to you this time, Woods. She thinks you don\u0027t want her. She needs to face that fear on her own, too.\" Fuck no! \"You can\u0027t expect me to stay here and let her think I don\u0027t want her. That\u0027s not okay, Braden. It\u0027s not fucking okay. She shouldn\u0027t have to overcome a fear that\u0027s pointless. How can she think I don\u0027t love her? That she isn\u0027t my heart, my soul, my future? That\u0027s the one thing she should never doubt. That, she needs to know.\" \"Listen. I know this is hard and you\u0027ve been great so far but give her just a couple more days. Please. She needs this. Remember this is about what she needs, not what you want.\" I started to hit the wall again and stopped myself at the last minute. That wasn\u0027t going to help anything. I had to calm down. \"When she left here she took my soul with her. I will always belong to her. I don\u0027t want her to ever think differently.\" \"Trust me, I know this. But she doesn\u0027t. She thinks you haven\u0027t tried to contact me or Tripp and you don\u0027t care that she\u0027s gone. That you\u0027re relieved she left. Before you run out to your truck, take a deep breath and remind yourself that you\u0027ll get to correct her belief in a few days. Just give her a few more days. She doesn\u0027t need you here messing with her emotions while she\u0027s facing her demons and figuring out that she\u0027s going to be okay. When she sees you again she needs to feel like she can be what you need.\" \"Two days. That\u0027s it. She comes to me in two days or I\u0027m coming there. I can\u0027t do this anymore. It isn\u0027t for me that I want to come. It\u0027s because I can\u0027t let the woman I love believe I don\u0027t want her. I\u0027ve done this for as long as I can stand it. Two days is all I\u0027m promising,\" I told her. \"Fine, two days.\" I dropped the phone to the bed and sat down beside it. Della had overcome her night terrors. She was getting better. She was going to be whole. If I could make it just two more days. My mother had called and woken me up that morning. I told her I\u0027d be at her house in an hour to talk. She was furious and I had been avoiding her calls. It was time I talked to her. She would know soon who the new board members were when I held a party at the club to celebrate their new positions. Everyone would know and she wasn\u0027t going to be happy about it. Dean Finlay might send her into a rage. She should be prepared. When I arrived at her house, Harry, the chauffeur I\u0027d hired for Mother after I fired Leo when I returned to Rosemary, was loading my mother\u0027s bags into her Benz. She was going somewhere, obviously. Good. That was probably best. I nodded as I passed Harry. He was my employee. Leo had been my father\u0027s. Leo had also left Della in handcuffs for five hours in the back of a car and hadn\u0027t let her use the restroom. I\u0027d fired him before I could get my hands on him. \"She\u0027s leaving, I see.\" Harry nodded. \"Yes, sir. I\u0027m taking her to the airport at nine,\" he replied. \"Thanks, Harry.\" I headed to the door and didn\u0027t knock. It was standing open. The house cleaner, Martha, was standing there, wringing her hands nervously. I was sure she\u0027d seen and heard my mother\u0027s anger. I smiled at her reassuringly. Stopping at the bottom of the stairs, I called out, \"Mother. I\u0027m here.\" Then I turned to look back at Martha. \"It\u0027s okay. You can finish doing what you were doing. She won\u0027t kill me. Even if she\u0027s threatened to.\" Martha didn\u0027t look too sure but she nodded and scurried off. Mother came to the top of the stairs with her purse over her arm. \"I\u0027m leaving,\" she stated, as if I hadn\u0027t figured that out already. \"I see that,\" I replied. She walked down the staircase and I waited for more of an explanation. \"You have chosen to defy your father\u0027s memory. You have taken everything he set into place and thrown it away. Those men you let go were a part of the Kerrington Club for over thirty years. They are trusted confidantes. You thumb your nose at that. You\u0027re a foolish child. I don\u0027t want to stay here and watch you destroy this legacy. Your grandfather was a silly man. He shouldn\u0027t have left anything to you. A twenty-five-year-old boy isn\u0027t old enough to run a business like this one. You know nothing.\" I let her angry words seethe from her mouth. She needed to get this out and it was time I let her. When her furious gaze leveled on me and stayed there I decided it was my turn to speak. \"Those men were my father\u0027s confidantes. Not mine. I put in place those who are close to me. It\u0027s time for a change. The club will be run differently now. I\u0027m not Father. But I strive every day to be like the man who built this club. I admire my grandfather and hope to be worthy of his legacy one day. I hope you travel safely and will check in with me so that I know you\u0027re doing well. I love you, Mother. You may not believe me or even care, but I do. You\u0027re my mom. That will never change.\" She opened her mouth, then snapped it closed again. I believed, deep down, that she loved me, too. But right now her pride was too big to accept that emotion where I was concerned. She pulled her purse up to her shoulder and looked at the door. \"I\u0027m going to our apartment in Manhattan. I have friends there, and I prefer to live there now. Rosemary has changed.\" Yes, it had. And I hoped it would keep changing. \"I wish you happiness,\" I replied. She didn\u0027t look back at me. I watched as she walked out the front door with the click of her heels echoing through the house. She would come back one day. She would love me one day. But for now, she had to go. She had to be mad. And letting her go was something I could do.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/simple-perfection-perfection-2/page-27.html","bookId":1992,"book":{"id":1992,"title":"Simple Perfection (Perfection #2)","description":"Storyline: Simple Perfection (Perfection #2) Woods had his perfect life mapped out for him.
