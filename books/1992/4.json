What the hell does she need now?\"\\n\\n Did she come here often? I fought back the jealousy that wanted to eat its way inside me. Of course she came by to see him. She was staying with his mother and helping her deal with things, which in turn was helping Woods. Unlike me. I wasn\u0027t doing anything to help him. I didn\u0027t know what to do.\\n\\n I started to get out of his lap but his hands tightened on me.\\n\\n \"We need to get dressed.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t leave me here with her.\"\\n\\n I leaned over and kissed the tip of his nose. \"I won\u0027t go anywhere. But I prefer to be wearing clothes when she walks in.\"\\n\\n Woods let out a sigh and let go of me so I could get up and get dressed.\\n\\n \"You get dressed, too. I don\u0027t care what she\u0027s seen before me, I don\u0027t want her seeing it now.\"\\n\\n Woods laughed out loud and stood up. \"I\u0027m going to put my clothes on, sexy. Calm down.\"\\n\\n We both grinned at each other as we dressed. I liked the idea of her coming in here and seeing us together and knowing what we had been doing. It was silly for me to feel that way, but I did.\\n\\n \"You can send her in,\" Woods replied, standing at his desk while he watched me fix my hair, which our wild sex had messed up. My ponytail was barely hanging on.\\n\\n The door swung open and I spun around to see Angelina strutting inside like she belonged here. \"I don\u0027t know why you . . .\" Her voice trailed off as her gaze landed on me. I finished adjusting my ponytail and let my hands fall back down to my sides.\\n\\n \"Did you really just---\"\\n\\n \"Why are you back?\" Woods cut off her question.\\n\\n Angelina jerked her gaze to him as if he\u0027d slapped her. I watched as she fought to compose herself. Woods hadn\u0027t bothered to run his fingers through his hair and it was messed up from my hands being in it. I bit back a smile as I looked at his properly rumpled appearance.\\n\\n \"I came back to tell you your mother wants to have you over for dinner,\" Angelina said tightly.\\n\\n \"Unless Della is invited, I\u0027m afraid I won\u0027t be able to make it.\"\\n\\n Angelina let out a frustrated sigh and shot me an annoyed glance before looking back at Woods. \"She\u0027s your mother, Woods. She just lost her husband and she\u0027s hurting. You\u0027re all she has left. Don\u0027t you get that? Do you not care?\"\\n\\n She was right. Woods\u0027s mother might never like me. But she was his mother, and right now she needed him. \"I want you to go, Woods,\" I said before he could say anything.\\n\\n He looked over at me and frowned.\\n\\n \"Please,\" I said, hoping he wouldn\u0027t argue with me in front of her.\\n\\n Woods ran a hand through his hair and I smiled at the way it was still messed up. He was adorable like that. \"Fine. But only for an hour. This will also be a one-time thing. Next time I have dinner with her, Della will be with me.\"\\n\\n Angelina\u0027s annoyed grimace turned into a pleased smile. She would get him tonight, too, without me around. I hated that but I couldn\u0027t let it keep Woods from his mother.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m glad you\u0027re thinking with something other than your dick,\" Angelina replied before spinning around and heading out the door.\\n\\n \"She\u0027s a bitch. Ignore her,\" Woods said, shoving off from the desk he\u0027d been leaning on and walking over to me.\\n\\n \"I know,\" I assured him, but deep down I worried that she was right.\\n\\n \"They\u0027re at the door, Della. Don\u0027t let them in here. They\u0027ll hurt us. All they want to do is hurt us. We have to keep your brother safe. They tried to kill him before. They\u0027ll kill us this time. Don\u0027t let them in. Shhhh. Stop that crying, you little brat! You have to be quiet. So very quiet, then they\u0027ll go away.\"\\n\\n I covered my mouth with both my hands to keep in the terrified cries I couldn\u0027t control. I hated when this happened. Mom would get mean afterward. She didn\u0027t like it when people knocked on our door. It upset her. And she would talk to him. He wasn\u0027t there, but she saw him. That scared me, too.\\n\\n \"Get up! They\u0027re gone. Go to the door and get the package they left and be careful that they don\u0027t see you.\"\\n\\n I didn\u0027t want to open the door. I wasn\u0027t sure what was out there that wanted to get me, but I didn\u0027t want to open the door. Momma had been making me do that more and more lately. Since my sixth birthday.\\n\\n Pain seared my head as she wrapped her hand around my ponytail and jerked me to my feet. I couldn\u0027t let her hear me cry or this would get worse.\\n\\n \"Go!\" she screamed in that voice that sent chills down my body. The hard shove from her hands sent me stumbling out of the closet and into the hallway. She would stay in the closet until I came back with the package.\\n\\n I glanced back at her but instead of seeing her wild, distant eyes there was blood. It was pouring out of the room and into the hallway. No . . . no, there wasn\u0027t supposed to be blood.\\n\\n Then a shrill scream of terror ripped from the small room.\\n\\n I jolted straight up and the scream was still echoing around me as it tore from my chest. It was my own scream. It was always my scream. Not my mother\u0027s.\\n\\n I was still alone. Looking around the living room, I took slow, deep breaths while my heart kept hammering against my chest. I pulled my legs up and tucked my knees under my chest. Falling asleep without Woods here wasn\u0027t something I did often. Having him near me while I slept kept me from having night terrors for the most part.\\n\\n The clock on the fridge said it was after nine. He should have been home over an hour ago. Had he stayed later with his mother? I reached for my phone on the coffee table and saw that I had two missed calls and one text message. All from Woods.\\n\\n I clicked the text message.\\n\\n {tm}Please answer. I\u0027m worried about you and Mom passed out during dinner. I think she hasn\u0027t been eating properly. Call me!{tx}\\n\\n That had been ten minutes ago. I jumped up from the couch and started to dial his number when the front door swung open and Woods came running inside. His eyes locked on mine and he stopped and let out a deep breath. \"Thank God. Shit, baby, you scared me.\"\\n\\n I dropped my phone and walked over to him. \"I\u0027m so sorry. I just woke up. I fell asleep on the couch. How\u0027s your mother?\"\\n\\n Woods pulled me against him and wrapped his arms around me. \"She was too weak to stand up so I called an ambulance. Angelina kept saying it could be a stroke. She rode in the ambulance with Mom so I could come back here and check on you.\"\\n\\n I pushed at his chest. \"Go! Go to the hospital. No, wait, let me get my shoes, I\u0027m going too.\"\\n\\n \"Are you sure? If you\u0027re tired I don\u0027t want to drag you to the hospital. We could be there all night.\"\\n\\n I slipped my feet into a pair of tennis shoes and ran my hands through my hair. \"I want to be with you.\"\\n\\n Woods smiled and held out his hand for me. \"Good. I won\u0027t be able to focus if I\u0027m worried about you here alone. If you need to sleep, I can always hold you.\"\\n\\n I tried not to think about the fact that Angelina was helping him take care of his mother. He had been able to leave her knowing she would be there beside his mother. What was I good for? He had to worry about me. I was weak and needy. I was one more thing for him to stress over. I wasn\u0027t any help at all.\\n\\n \"Stop frowning. She\u0027s gonna be okay. The paramedics said there\u0027s a good chance her potassium is low. They don\u0027t think it\u0027s a stroke but they said due to her heart rate we needed to admit her and let doctors check her out.\"\\n\\n I nodded as he laced his fingers through mine. \"Let\u0027s go,\" I told him.\\n\\n I was going to find a way to be helpful. He needed someone to lean on right now and I was going to be that someone.\\n\\n \"Did you sleep okay without me here?\" he asked as we stepped outside.\\n\\n \"Yes. I slept great,\" I lied, because telling him the truth would only have upset him. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/simple-perfection-perfection-2/page-4.html","bookId":1992,"book":{"id":1992,"title":"Simple Perfection (Perfection #2)","description":"Storyline: Simple Perfection (Perfection #2) \\n Woods had his perfect life mapped out for him.
