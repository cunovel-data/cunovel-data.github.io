Mother had never done well alone. I had seen her at the club playing tennis with a few of her friends earlier in the week. She had put on a good show for them, treating me like she was proud of me. But I knew she was still mad at me. I\u0027d been going along with her acting all my life.\\n\\n I had sent Della to my office to organize some files on my desk that didn\u0027t really need organizing. I just wanted her safely out of the way while Mother was here. I wasn\u0027t sure my mom could act as if she liked Della. And I wasn\u0027t going to have Della hurt or embarrassed.\\n\\n The rest of the staff loved Della. When they saw her coming, everyone became happier and nicer. They didn\u0027t want to let her down. Whatever had been wrong the moment before they were willing to fix. It was helping me out a shit-ton. My jealousy over the fact that the males on my staff bent over backward to make her smile was difficult. But then who wouldn\u0027t want to make Della happy? I couldn\u0027t be mad at them for that. As long as they kept their hands off of her.\\n\\n \"Where\u0027s Della?\" Marco, our golf pro, asked as he walked into the clubhouse.\\n\\n \"Why do you need Della?\" I asked, reminding myself that this man was happily married.\\n\\n \"She was working on getting me a sub for next week. They\u0027re inducing Jill on Monday and I want to be with her and the baby the first week.\"\\n\\n \"I have her working on something. I\u0027ll check to make sure she has a sub for you. You should be with your wife and child,\" I replied.\\n\\n \"Thanks, Mr. Kerrington,\" he replied, and nodded before heading over to grab a water from the cooler.\\n\\n The back door swung open and Vince stood there, looking wide-eyed. \"Mr. Kerrington, sir, you need to come quick.\"\\n\\n It was Della. I knew that look. She was having one of her episodes. Shit!\\n\\n I ran for the door. \"Where is she?\" I asked him.\\n\\n \"In your office, sir. She came up to see you and then your mom stopped by. I tried to call you but it went to voice mail. Your mom went into the office to talk to Della. After she came out I heard Della whimpering. I knocked, sir, but she didn\u0027t respond so I went in.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s enough. I know the rest. Don\u0027t tell anyone about this, do you understand?\" I waited until he nodded before I sprinted across the parking lot into the main offices. My mother is off her damn leash. Fuck! I shouldn\u0027t have left Della alone for so long.\\n\\n Several people called my name as I ran for the stairs, not wanting to wait on the damn elevator. Taking the stairs two at a time, I reached the third floor in less than a minute. My office door was closed and I was thankful Vince hadn\u0027t left her exposed to whoever walked up there.\\n\\n I swung the door open and scanned the room until I found her sitting against the wall with her knees pulled up to her chin. Her arms were wrapped around her legs and she was rocking back and forth, whimpering. I hated seeing her like this. She\u0027d been doing so well. Her night terrors had eased off; she hadn\u0027t experienced any in a month, at least.\\n\\n \"Della.\" I called her name as I walked over to her, hoping she could hear me and my voice would draw her out. I bent down beside her and pulled her into my arms. She was stiff and cold.\\n\\n \"No, no, no, no, no,\" she chanted over and over.\\n\\n \"I have you, sweetheart. You\u0027re in my arms. I have you, Della. Shh, it\u0027s okay. Come back to me, baby. Please come back to me. I\u0027m right here and I have you.\" I whispered in her ear how much I loved her; I wasn\u0027t going to let her go until her body started to ease.\\n\\n Slowly, her arms loosened their grip around her legs and wrapped around me, and then she buried her face in my neck. She was back. I continued to tell her she was wonderful and she was mine and I would take care of her. Reassuring her reassured me that I had her. That she was here and I could take care of her. I had let her take on too much responsibility because she was good at it. I had started letting her work longer and I was checking on her less. This was my fault. My mother would never have gotten to her if I had been watching her closer.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" Della said in a teary voice against my chest.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t say that,\" I replied as I ran my hand over her hair and down her back. \"Please, baby, don\u0027t say that. I hate for you to think you have to say that.\"\\n\\n She sniffled. \"I need to be stronger. I want to be stronger. I want to be tough.\"\\n\\n Did she not realize how fucking tough she was? She had lived a horror story for sixteen years of her life that had ended even more horrifically. And she still laughed and found reasons to smile. She was brave enough to live life, even after enduring the monsters that had terrorized her in her room as a child. And they weren\u0027t pretend. She\u0027d faced real monsters and she had survived. There was no one as fucking tough as this woman.\\n\\n \"Della, you are tougher than anyone I know. Just because you have to protect yourself sometimes and fade away from me doesn\u0027t make you weak. You\u0027re a survivor. You are my inspiration and I love you. No matter what, I love you.\"\\n\\n Della clung tighter to me. My mother had upset her. I would deal with her. She wouldn\u0027t get close to Della again, even if I had to ban her from the club. This would stop. I was done with my family hurting what was mine.\\n\\n We sat there in silence. Della let me hold her as close as I needed to. She let me kiss her head and hands and run my hands over her arms and back to reassure myself she was okay.\\n\\n The knock on the door ended our peace and quiet. Della started to move out of my lap but I held her to me. I was going to ignore whoever it was. Vince should have been out there by now.\\n\\n \"Is everything okay, sir?\" Vince asked from the other side of the door.\\n\\n \"Yes, we\u0027re fine,\" I replied.\\n\\n Della tilted her head back to look up at me. \"Did he see me?\"\\n\\n I nodded. I didn\u0027t want to lie to her, even though I knew she hated for people to see her when she was like that.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s going to think I\u0027m insane,\" she said with a defeated sigh.\\n\\n I grabbed her chin and made her look up at me. \"No, he won\u0027t. You aren\u0027t insane. You are intelligent, lovable, and beautiful. But you are not insane. You lived through hell and you beat it, Della. Most people can\u0027t overcome something like what you\u0027ve overcome. Don\u0027t ever think you\u0027re less than amazing.\"\\n\\n A small smile tugged at the corners of her lips. \"You just love me,\" she said.\\n\\n \"More than life,\" I replied before pressing my lips to hers. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/simple-perfection-perfection-2/page-11.html","bookId":1992,"book":{"id":1992,"title":"Simple Perfection (Perfection #2)","description":"Storyline: Simple Perfection (Perfection #2) \\n Woods had his perfect life mapped out for him.
