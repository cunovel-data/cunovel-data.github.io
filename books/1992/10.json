I hadn\u0027t spoken to her since the incident with Angelina except for the few times I\u0027d seen her with Rush around the club. It was odd because I felt like we had a bond now that we\u0027d faced down Angelina together. She\u0027d been my hero that night. She made me want to be tough. I wasn\u0027t tough and I wanted to be so bad.\n I walked out of Woods\u0027s old office, which he\u0027d moved me into and told me to decorate any way I wanted. Blaire was headed toward me.\n \"You even have an office now,\" Blaire said, smiling brightly. I had to admit I loved having an office. Specifically this office. I had many good memories there. I didn\u0027t intend to change anything about it.\n \"Yes, I feel very official,\" I replied.\n \"Good. I\u0027m glad Woods has you. You\u0027re perfect for him.\"\n I didn\u0027t agree with her. He could have done better---so much better---but I was working toward being good enough. Strong enough. Tough enough.\n \"Ready for lunch?\" I asked, wanting to change the subject.\n \"I\u0027m starving. Nate isn\u0027t sleeping as much as he used to. He keeps me busy but it\u0027s wonderful. Downside is, I don\u0027t have a lot of time to eat. When Rush is home he helps out a ton and makes sure I have time to eat. Anyway, I\u0027m ready for a baby-free meal.\"\n Nate was Rush and Blaire\u0027s baby boy. He was an adorable mixture of the two of them. I didn\u0027t normally think guys with piercings and that rough rock star look were attractive, but Rush Finlay holding a baby in his arms was very nice to look at.\n \"Is Rush with Nate now?\" I asked as we walked to the dining room.\n \"Yes. They\u0027re going fishing, which means Nate is going to sit on a blanket and eat sand, if he can get to the edge of the blanket, and Rush is going to fish for about five minutes before realizing he can\u0027t fish and watch Nate at the same time. Then he\u0027ll stop fishing and they\u0027ll sit at the edge of the water and let their feet get wet.\"\n The happiness in Blaire\u0027s voice was unmistakable. Rush Finlay made her happy. She made him happy. That was what I had with Woods but it was different. Rush could leave her alone with their baby and not worry about her zoning out and getting lost in her head. He could love her and not worry that his baby would inherit her mental illness. Their love was easy. It was the kind that would go the distance. What Woods and I had wasn\u0027t.\n Every time I saw Rush holding his baby, I wanted that for Woods. The proud look in his eyes and joy on his face. I couldn\u0027t give him that.\n \"You okay?\" Blaire\u0027s voice broke into my thoughts and I forced a smile.\n \"I\u0027m sorry. Work on the brain. I promise to shut it off and be a good lunch date,\" I assured her.\n \"As long as it\u0027s work that\u0027s causing that distressed look on your face,\" Blaire replied, sounding like she didn\u0027t believe me.\n I hadn\u0027t been brave enough to talk to my best friend, Braden, about this. She loved me fiercely and thought I could do no wrong. She also thought I could be a mother and stable wife. She lived in a fairy tale that I didn\u0027t allow myself to step into. Would Blaire be the same way, or would she see my side and understand my fears?\n The hostess snapped to attention when she saw me and led us to Woods\u0027s table. He had told the staff in the dining room that his table should be available at my convenience.\n \"Oh, we get the good table,\" Blaire said, grinning, as we sat down. \"I guess you\u0027re the boss now, too.\"\n \"Woods made a big deal out of them always seating me here.\" I felt myself blush and Blaire laughed.\n \"That\u0027s sweet,\" she said.\n I wasn\u0027t sure how to respond to that. It was sweet. Woods was always sweet. He was impossible to get mad at. Even when he deserved it. Like when he made the new server, Ken, almost pee his pants for talking to me.\n Jimmy came strutting out of the kitchen, grinning at us.\n \"Looks like we\u0027re going to get special service, too,\" I said, nodding my head toward Jimmy.\n \"Well, hello, my beauties. I didn\u0027t know I was gonna get this lucky today,\" he said with a southern drawl that made most women drool over him.\n \"Hello, Jimmy,\" Blaire said.\n \"You broke loose from baby duty, I see,\" he teased.\n \"It\u0027s never a duty,\" she replied.\n \"Sweet tea for both of you?\" he asked.\n \"Sparkling mineral water for me,\" Blaire told him.\n His eyebrows shot up and then he laughed. \"Well look at Alabama getting all sophisticated with her water choices. Damn, baby girl, I remember when you drank water out of the tap.\"\n Blaire laughed. \"It\u0027s better for the baby than soda or tea. That\u0027s all.\"\n \"Mmm-hmm, next you\u0027re gonna be ordering sushi with that raw shit in it,\" he said, shaking his finger at her. Then he shot us both a wink and turned to head back to the kitchen.\n \"He\u0027s a mess,\" Blaire said with fondness in her tone.\n \"Yes he is, but he runs the kitchen so well. I don\u0027t know what we\u0027d do without him.\"\n Blaire leaned back in her seat and crossed her legs. \"You\u0027d beg and plead with him to come back. That\u0027s what you\u0027d do.\"\n She knew exactly how important he was. She had once been a server there, too. Jimmy had been her first friend in Rosemary. The story went that she came into town looking for her daddy and found her daddy\u0027s new wife\u0027s son instead. Rush Finlay wasn\u0027t a fan of her father and disliked her on the spot. But he let her live in the maid\u0027s room while she worked for Woods and made some money until her dad got back from France with Rush\u0027s mom.\n Rush treated her poorly but ended up falling for her against his will. They had more pain to work through in the end and a lie that tore them apart. I wouldn\u0027t have believed any of it seeing them now, but Bethy had told me all about it. She\u0027d been Blaire\u0027s friend through it all.\n \"Did my gun effectively run off the wicked witch, or did Woods do that?\" Blaire asked.\n \"I think it was your gun and the fact that she was scared of what Woods would do once he found out. She left that night and we haven\u0027t seen or heard from her since. Mrs. Kerrington isn\u0027t very happy with Woods about the whole thing. She blames him for her leaving.\"\n \"You\u0027re welcome to tell her that it was all me,\" Blaire said with a smile.\n \"Thank you, but I don\u0027t think it will matter. She doesn\u0027t approve of me. She wants Angelina for Woods.\"\n Blaire sighed. \"I understand that. I have a mother-in-law who hates me so badly she hasn\u0027t even seen her only grandchild.\"\n Blaire was poised and beautiful. She wasn\u0027t dealing with something like a mental illness, so you would think her mother-in-law would have loved her. But she represented something to Rush\u0027s mother that couldn\u0027t ever go away. It was part of the dark past she shared with Blaire\u0027s dad.\n \"I heard Rush\u0027s dad was in town last week visiting Nate,\" I said, remembering how the entire club had talked nonstop about the drummer from Slacker Demon being in town. He was a legend, just like the rock band he was a part of.\n \"Yes. Dean is a wonderful grandfather. It is a bit surreal to see him cuddling with Nate and singing to him. Nate adores the man. I love to watch Rush\u0027s face while he witnesses his dad with his son. It brings me to tears every time.\"\n \"I would imagine that is special,\" I replied. I didn\u0027t have parents who would see any child I might have one day. If I ever felt safe enough to have a child. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/simple-perfection-perfection-2/page-10.html","bookId":1992,"book":{"id":1992,"title":"Simple Perfection (Perfection #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Simple Perfection (Perfection #2) \n Woods had his perfect life mapped out for him.
