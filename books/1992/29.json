Everyone I had asked had agreed. Well, everyone except one of them. He would come around though. In time.\n My thoughts went back to Della. I had twenty-four more hours before I was going after her. She would arrive here by then or I was going to Georgia and Braden could get over it. I had agreed with her at first but I didn\u0027t agree now. It was taking too long. Every day Della was away from me, she convinced herself even more that I didn\u0027t want her.\n \"I feel like a badass,\" Jace drawled.\n I turned to look at him. He was standing in the doorway with a cup of coffee and a grin on his face. \"When did we get so damn old?\" he asked, then chuckled and walked inside.\n \"We\u0027re not old,\" I replied.\n \"Who\u0027s old? I\u0027m not fucking old,\" Thad said as he followed Jace into the room.\n I had debated asking Thad to be a part of the board. He was rarely serious and he still thought he was seventeen most of the time. But he was one of us. His father had been a board member. He should be one too.\n \"I\u0027m old. That\u0027s who\u0027s old,\" Darla announced as she walked into the room with her iPad in her hands, typing away at it. She was always working. That was why she was the best.\n \"No, you\u0027re not. You\u0027re wise,\" I assured her.\n She snorted and barely glanced up from what she was working on before she took her seat.\n \"This kind of feels like the knights of the fucking round table,\" Grant said as he sauntered into the room with a grin and a glass of what I assumed was bourbon. He really was drinking a lot more these days. I wondered if Rush knew about this.\n \"This needs to be quick. Nate\u0027s checkup is in two hours. I have to be there. They weigh him and shit. I don\u0027t want to miss that,\" Rush said as he walked into the room, followed by Dean.\n \"I\u0027m not missing it either,\" Dean said, reaching into his pocket and pulling out a pack of cigarettes.\n \"No smoking in here, Dean,\" I told him.\n He grumbled. \"You bunch of prejudiced asses. No one lets me smoke anywhere around here. It\u0027s fucking insane. I need to go back to home where I can smoke a joint on that street if I get the urge.\"\n I ignored his rock star hissy fit. We were all here. At least the ones who were in Rosemary. We were missing two. One would take her place soon. The other still had his shit to figure out.\n \"Are you drinking bourbon this early?\" Rush asked, looking at Grant with a frown.\n Grant rolled his eyes and leaned back, propping his feet on the table. \"Yeah,\" was his response.\n \"Really? You\u0027ve started drinking whiskey before lunch?\" Rush wasn\u0027t giving in and I really didn\u0027t want them having this fight in here.\n \"He\u0027s fucking your sister. Hell, anyone that stupid has to drink to stay sane,\" Dean said in a bored tone.\n Shit. This was gonna go downhill fast.\n \"Don\u0027t respond to that, either of you,\" I said, standing at the head of the table.\n \"It\u0027s okay. It\u0027s true,\" Grant said, and held up his drink with a grin that didn\u0027t reach his eyes.\n Rush swore under his breath.\n \"Harlow\u0027s too damn sweet for you. You know that, don\u0027t you, boy? She don\u0027t need Nan\u0027s seconds. She\u0027s too good for that. She\u0027s the kind of girl you can look at but can\u0027t touch. They\u0027re too unattainable for guys like us. Only those who can reach the pedestal she\u0027s on can touch her,\" Dean said.\n \"Harlow?\u0027 Rush asked, looking at his dad in confusion. \"What\u0027s Harlow got to do with this?\"\n Dean just grinned. \"What happens in LA stays in LA.\" He winked at Grant. \"Don\u0027t it, boy?\"\n Yeah . . . there was a lot I didn\u0027t know. I was pretty damn sure I didn\u0027t want to know either. \"Okay, let\u0027s get off Grant\u0027s private life and let\u0027s focus on the point of this meeting. As you all know, you are now my board of directors. I don\u0027t make decisions without meeting with this group and discussing it. You are my advisers. It\u0027s time to take the Kerrington Club into the next generation. We\u0027re going to do that together.\"\n Darla\u0027s pleased smile as she sat back and listened to me talk meant more than she could have known. She was proud of me. Right now, I needed someone to be proud of me.\n \"Does this mean we can get rid of those damn coming-out balls? That shit is ancient,\" Jace said.\n \"Hey. Don\u0027t knock the coming-out ball. The girls get all sentimental, which leads to horniness,\" Thad argued.\n \"Could you please watch what you say in here, Thad? We have a lady on the board and another will be joining us soon.\"\n Thad looked properly guilty. \"Sorry, Miss Darla,\" he said sheepishly.\n \"No worries, Thad. I\u0027ve been watching your horny ass screw through my cart girls for years.\"\n The entire room went silent, then burst into laughter. This was a good group. We would make my grandfather proud. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/simple-perfection-perfection-2/page-29.html","bookId":1992,"book":{"id":1992,"title":"Simple Perfection (Perfection #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Simple Perfection (Perfection #2) \n Woods had his perfect life mapped out for him.
