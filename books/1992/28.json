When his eyes met mine as I stepped into the restaurant, I could see that he noticed it, too.\\n\\n I was more nervous about this than meeting Glenda. I\u0027d never had a father. I didn\u0027t know what that felt like. What a meeting with the man whose sperm gave me life would even be like. My first question had been, did he really want to have this meeting? The answer was clearly yes. He\u0027d boarded a plane to Atlanta hours after I\u0027d called him that morning. He said he could meet me at seven at this restaurant. I had been surprised by his desire to come here so soon. I had even expected him to make excuses.\\n\\n \"Hello, Della,\" he said as he stood up and held out his hand for me to shake.\\n\\n \"Hello, Nile,\" I replied, slipping my hand into his. He was tall. Glenda had said he played basketball and I could see why. His hair was a dark color that contrasted greatly with his blue eyes. He was a handsome man. I could see what Glenda\u0027s teenage heart had seen.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m so glad you wanted to meet me. I\u0027ve been waiting for that call since Glenda let me know she found you.\"\\n\\n He hadn\u0027t wanted me. But he\u0027d been a seventeen-year-old boy. I couldn\u0027t hold that against him. It wasn\u0027t like he had been an adult who had made the decision to give me away. He hadn\u0027t been old enough to be a parent yet. Not really.\\n\\n \"I like Glenda,\" I said simply.\\n\\n Nile grinned and he sat down after I did. \"Yeah, she\u0027s something else.\"\\n\\n There was a tenderness in his eyes that surprised me. He had loved her once. It had been young love but he had loved her. It had been real. And somewhere deep down it had never really gone away for him. Glenda didn\u0027t get that soft look in her eyes when she talked about Nile. She admired the man he had become and said his wife was gorgeous and perfect for him. Nile reacted differently.\\n\\n \"I guess she told you about what happened,\" he said.\\n\\n I nodded. \"She did. I understand. You were both young.\"\\n\\n He studied me a moment, then shook his head. \"You look so much like her. It\u0027s amazing. But you got my eyes. My other girls don\u0027t have my eyes. They got their mother\u0027s. But you got them.\"\\n\\n His other girls. He hadn\u0027t called them his girls. He hadn\u0027t made them sound exclusive. He had said other. Something in me warmed. In his mind I was one of his girls. I didn\u0027t know him. I hadn\u0027t even known about him until a few days ago. But he had always known I existed.\\n\\n \"Did you know that I was a girl . . . before you heard from Glenda?\"\\n\\n A frown creased his forehead, then a small smile touched his lips. \"Yeah. She told me. After you were born she told me she held you. That you were perfect and that she\u0027d given you away. I got drunk that night. Real drunk. Wrecked my dad\u0027s car and almost lost my scholarship. I went a little self-destructive for a while. I was a kid myself but I kept seeing this small baby whose face I had never seen, and I knew she was mine. But I\u0027d never held her. I\u0027d never been able to kiss her.\" He shook his head. \"It was the hardest thing I\u0027d ever experienced. Then Glenda moved. Without a word of explanation she was gone. I didn\u0027t see or hear from her for over thirteen years. Then one day she called me. She wanted to find you. I didn\u0027t want to. It wasn\u0027t because I didn\u0027t want to see you, because I did. I was just afraid to see her. She, uh . . .\" He cleared his throat and tugged at his collar. \"She\u0027s my one that got away. You never quite get over that one.\"\\n\\n I felt like pointing out that she hadn\u0027t gotten away, that he\u0027d sent her running, but I didn\u0027t. That ship had sailed. They were both married with kids. \"What are your daughters like?\" I asked. I had never had siblings. Not ones that I remembered. To know I had half siblings in this world was hard to comprehend. I was curious about them. I wanted to know if they were anything like me.\\n\\n Glenda\u0027s daughter was young but she had a free spirit. She\u0027d told me I looked like a princess. She asked me if I could fly a plane and told me that one day she was going to fly planes. I had been fascinated with her. All her long blond hair, like her father\u0027s. Her name was Samantha but they called her Sammy. I liked knowing she was my sister. That what she was could have been me. I could have been like that as a child. I could have been so free. Knowing she would get a chance to live her dreams and have a family around her that loved her made me happy. It made the heaviness on my shoulders ease.\\n\\n \"Three of them are difficult but they\u0027re fun too. Jasmine is the oldest by one minute and fifty-six seconds, and she doesn\u0027t let the other two forget it. Jocelyn is the middle child and she\u0027s the most like me. She plans to be a basketball star. Then there is my baby, July. That\u0027s the month I met their mother. She\u0027s what warms me when I need it most. July is the perfect name for her. She\u0027s also the sweetest and most forgiving.\"\\n\\n \"They all have J names,\" I said, smiling at the idea.\\n\\n \"Their mother\u0027s name is Jillian.\"\\n\\n I liked that. \"I would like to meet them,\" I said.\\n\\n Nile\u0027s smile grew. \"I would love that. So would they. I told them about you after I got the call from Glenda. Jillian already knew about the baby . . . about you. So, she stood behind the idea of me meeting you. She would like to meet you too.\"\\n\\n \"Okay,\" I replied.\\n\\n The server appeared and we ordered our drinks and Nile asked if I wanted an appetizer. I wasn\u0027t really hungry at the moment so I told him no. Once the server left he turned his attention back to me. \"What was your life like growing up, Della?\"\\n\\n This was a question that Glenda hadn\u0027t asked me. I had been prepared for her to ask me but she never did. Because of that, I had let my guard down with Nile. He was different. He wanted to know. He wasn\u0027t afraid to hear the answer. I could tell that Glenda was afraid of the truth.\\n\\n \"It wasn\u0027t easy. I wanted to meet you because I needed to know what the people who created me were like. I needed to know I was going to be okay. But I\u0027m not ready to share my past with you. Honestly, I don\u0027t think you want details. If I were you, I wouldn\u0027t want to know.\"\\n\\n Nile\u0027s face paled at my words and his jaw worked back and forth. I picked up my water and took a drink. I was more honest with him than I had planned on being. But the words had come out without a filter.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re wrong. I want to know,\" he said in a quiet tone.\\n\\n I shook my head. \"No, you think you do but you don\u0027t. And I don\u0027t like talking about it. I\u0027m still working through some things. Meeting you and Glenda and seeing with my own eyes that you have healthy, happy children is what I need right now. It eases fears that I\u0027ve lived with a long time.\"\\n\\n Nile leaned his elbows on the table and studied me. \"You\u0027re scaring the shit out of me,\" he said.\\n\\n He had no idea.\\n\\n \"Nile, I want to get to know you. But I plan on taking that slow and doing it when I can deal with it. One day I\u0027m sure I\u0027ll be ready to tell you about my life. Until that moment, I don\u0027t want to discuss it again.\"\\n\\n He took a long, deep breath through his nose, then nodded. \"Okay. Fine. But the father in me wants to fix things.\"\\n\\n He wasn\u0027t my father. He was someone else\u0027s but he wasn\u0027t mine. He just provided the sperm that helped create me. \"The male in you wants to fix things. Not the father in you.\"\\n\\n He started to say something and stopped. A smile broke across his face and he leaned back. \"Who is he? The man who wants to fix things for you?\"\\n\\n I fidgeted with the napkin in my lap. \"I\u0027m not talking about that, either.\"\\n\\n \"Why not? Did he hurt you?\"\\n\\n I shook my head. \"No, he never hurt me.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/simple-perfection-perfection-2/page-28.html","bookId":1992,"book":{"id":1992,"title":"Simple Perfection (Perfection #2)","description":"Storyline: Simple Perfection (Perfection #2) \\n Woods had his perfect life mapped out for him.
