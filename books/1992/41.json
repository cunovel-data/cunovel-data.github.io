{"id":74346,"no":41,"title":"Page 41","content":"Woods It was time for the end-of-summer beach bonfire. The past two months had been perfect. Della was sharing more and more of her past with me and her dreams were starting to completely go away. She\u0027d woken me up in the middle of the night the week before last to tell me she\u0027d had a dream about us. That we\u0027d been having sex on the kitchen table. She\u0027d been so excited to have a dream that didn\u0027t contain the horrors of her past that she\u0027d been ready to play it out in real life. It was a pretty damn good way to wake up. I watched as she held Nate and danced around with him as the music pumped through the speakers. Blaire was in Rush\u0027s lap and they were watching Della with their son. She was beautiful. I wanted to see her dance around and laugh with our baby. I wanted her to have a child to love the way she was never loved. I wanted to know we had created something from the love that bound us so tightly together. \"She\u0027s happy,\" Jace said. \"She\u0027s perfect,\" I replied. Jace laughed and slapped me on the back. \"Just go ahead and do it. You know you want to. Put that little ring on her finger.\" \"I\u0027m planning it. Has to be special.\" Jace sighed. \"Yeah, I\u0027m planning it, too. Bethy and I\u0027ve had a hard summer but things are looking better. She\u0027s stopped running off to bars. I think she just had a dark time there for a while. She\u0027s been spending time with Blaire and Della again. That helps.\" Jace hadn\u0027t shown up on my doorstep upset about Bethy in two months. I was hoping things were better. \"Good. Glad you two are working it out.\" \"Oh, shit. Is that Nan?\" Jace said, pointing her out to me. \"I thought she left and went to Paris for the summer. Seeing Nan is gonna send Grant into a tailspin again.\" Grant wasn\u0027t at the party; he was out of town. That was happening a lot lately. He would show up for a couple of days then leave again. I was just glad he wasn\u0027t wasting time with Nan. \"Grant has moved on. If Nan\u0027s back, then he\u0027ll be fine. She was a bad mistake. He knows that now.\" Jace let out a low whistle. \"She\u0027s with August Schweep. What, did she bring him back from Paris with her?\" \"No. August is our new golf pro. We needed more than just Marco. When August hurt his rotator cuff his pro career was over. He wants to retire here, so he bought the Spencer house. He\u0027s working for me now.\" \"Looks like Nan is all over that.\" \"Good. At least it\u0027s not Grant.\" Jace snorted. \"Ain\u0027t that the truth.\" I was going to get Della and take her for a walk. The dark beach was a great place to get her alone. Turning, I glanced out over the water and saw Bethy staggering out to the waves. She knew better than that. There was a red flag up. Had been all week. The riptides were intense and it was dark. You don\u0027t swim in the gulf in the dark. \"Jace, man, what\u0027s Bethy doing?\" I asked, afraid to take my eyes off her. \"What is she doing now? She was drinking tequila shots earlier and I cut her off. She\u0027d had enough . . . shit!\" \"She\u0027s getting too deep,\" I said, taking a step toward the water. Jace took off running toward the water. I followed behind him. I heard someone scream from the crowd as Bethy\u0027s head went under the water. No. This couldn\u0027t be happening. Jace dove into the waves and took off toward her. I pulled my shirt off, afraid it would slow me down, before I dove in after him. I wasn\u0027t letting my best friend go into this alone. Bethy\u0027s gurgling scream filled the air. \"Relax, baby! Relax. Don\u0027t fight it. Please don\u0027t fight it. You\u0027ll go under and won\u0027t have the strength to rise back up,\" Jace was yelling as he swam toward her. I saw him grab her just as the deathly pull of a rip current grabbed him. This wasn\u0027t happening. No. \"I need you to take her, Woods!\" Jace yelled over the water\u0027s roar. \"Give me both your hands!\" I shouted. \"No! Take her. I got this. Take her, dammit! It\u0027s strong!\" Jace yelled. How was I supposed to take her and leave him out there? \"Come with me, Jace!\" I demanded. \"Woods, listen to me---\" His head went under and he came back up as he held a panicking Bethy in his arms. \"You have to take her or we\u0027ll all die. I\u0027m not gonna let her drown. Help me!\" I nodded. I had to do this. He could get out of the current. He was strong and he was smart. We had grown up knowing how to fight rip currents. I reached for Bethy as she screamed Jace\u0027s name. \"I love you,\" he told her as he let her go. She cried as she clung to my arms. \"Don\u0027t say that!\" I yelled at him. \"You\u0027re getting out of this. Don\u0027t fucking say that.\" \"Just get her out of here!\" he yelled, pushing her away from him and toward me as he held on to her arm. I could feel the pull getting closer. If I stayed here much longer I was going to get pulled into it, too. I wrapped my hand around Bethy\u0027s arm and pulled her out of the current, then tucked her under my arm and I started swimming back to shore. Rush came swimming up to us and relief surged through me. I was going to be able to help Jace. \"Give her to me,\" Rush said as he reached for Bethy. \"Go get him,\" she cried as Rush pulled her from my arms. I didn\u0027t wait for them to leave before I turned back around to get Jace. But Jace wasn\u0027t there. I glanced back at the shore to see if he\u0027d made his way back up there and I\u0027d missed it, but all I saw was Rush carrying Bethy out of the water. I turned back to the dark waves. I was met with silence. Nothing. He was just here. I just saw him. He isn\u0027t gone. It didn\u0027t happen that fast. I went under and forced my eyes open in the salty water, but all I could see was the darkness. I needed light. I reached around me, feeling for anything. My lungs started to burn. Kicking up, I broke the surface and took a deep breath. I heard my name from the shore. They were yelling for me. I also heard Jace\u0027s name. I couldn\u0027t go back without him. I went back under. I had to find Jace. I couldn\u0027t lose Jace. Not like this. Not now. We were supposed to be grumpy old men together. I fought back the panic starting to set in with each second that I couldn\u0027t find him. I swam underwater and fought the pull of the current as I reached out for some sign of him. Anything I could get my hands on. When my lungs couldn\u0027t take it anymore, I swam back to the top, only to be taken back under by a wave before I could breathe. I wasn\u0027t going down like this. I had to find Jace. Two arms grabbed ahold of me and jerked me to the surface as I started gasping for air and coughing. \"Dammit, Woods. Come on. You\u0027re gonna drown in this. He\u0027s gone, man. He\u0027s gone. I\u0027m not letting you drown, too.\" Rush\u0027s words sent a shock through my system. He\u0027s gone? No. No! He isn\u0027t gone. I fought against Rush\u0027s hold on me. \"Stop it! Della is up there in a crumpled mess, crying. Do you want to leave her? Is that what you want? To leave her like this?\" Della. Oh God. Della. I couldn\u0027t leave her. But I\u0027d lost Jace. I had lost Jace. Rush pulled us out of the waves and when my feet hit the sand he let me go. We stood there staring at each other and breathing hard. We knew what had happened and what we were going to face. I would have been gone, too, if Rush hadn\u0027t come after me. I would have left Della behind. I turned to see her getting up from the sand where she had been on her knees. Her face was red and soaked with tears. All she said was, \"Woods,\" before she threw herself into my arms. I watched in a daze as Blaire stood holding a hysterical Bethy. Sirens wailed in the distance. Sobs and cries filled the beach. And I stood there. Della clung to me. Her sobs eased but her hold never did. Rush walked over to take his crying son from Nan\u0027s arms. He held him to his chest, and although he wasn\u0027t crying the loss and pain were in his eyes. Me . . . I just felt empty.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/simple-perfection-perfection-2/page-41.html","bookId":1992,"book":{"id":1992,"title":"Simple Perfection (Perfection #2)","description":"Storyline: Simple Perfection (Perfection #2) Woods had his perfect life mapped out for him.
