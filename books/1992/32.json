I was fine with the bike,\" I told Tripp again when we pulled out of the car rental parking lot.\\n\\n \"Yeah, I did. Trust me,\" he replied with a smirk.\\n\\n I was tired of arguing with him about it. He had been determined to rent the car and now it was too late to change his mind. I leaned back in the seat and stared out the window. I would be in Rosemary in five hours. I wasn\u0027t sure if I would go to Woods\u0027s house or if I would go to a hotel. Maybe I could call Bethy. There was always Tripp\u0027s condo. I could ask him for one last favor. I\u0027d asked him for so many already.\\n\\n \"Are we going straight to Woods\u0027s place?\" Tripp asked.\\n\\n \"Um . . . I don\u0027t know. Maybe I shouldn\u0027t blindside him. I could just go see him tomorrow while he\u0027s in his office. That way I won\u0027t have to just show up at his house in case . . .\" I couldn\u0027t bring myself to say in case he\u0027s with someone else.\\n\\n \"What? You getting cold feet now? Can\u0027t do that. You want to get your man, then go get him.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not sure if that\u0027s the way I should do it.\"\\n\\n Tripp shifted in his seat and cleared his throat. \"Okay. Picture this: Woods is at his house with another woman. One he can\u0027t love like he loves you. You haven\u0027t been gone long enough for that. She\u0027s gonna get to sleep in his bed, where you belong, tonight. Unless you march up to his door and take back your man.\"\\n\\n The idea of this faceless woman sleeping in Woods\u0027s bed and touching him made me physically ill. No. He was mine. She couldn\u0027t touch him. He was mine first.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re getting fired up, aren\u0027t you? Ready to take back what belongs to you? I think it\u0027s about damn time. Shame to let him sleep with her another night when he would rather be with you. She\u0027s just filler.\"\\n\\n He was right. Woods wasn\u0027t in love with her. He had been in love with me. I could make him love me again. I could show him I wasn\u0027t weak. I was worthy of his love. I was going to fight for it. I would get him back---no one was sleeping over there tonight except for me. She was leaving. I\u0027d make her leave.\\n\\n \"Take me to Woods,\" I told him.\\n\\n Tripp let out a whoop and patted my leg. \"Attagirl. You got this,\" he said.\\n\\n I sure hoped I did. If not, I might\u0027ve been on my way to making a complete fool out of myself.\\n\\n When we were ten minutes away, I started having second thoughts.\\n\\n \"Maybe I should just go to your place tonight.\"\\n\\n Tripp let out a short laugh. \"Uh, yeah, no. Woods is already going to want to hurt me when he gets ahold of me. I\u0027m not about to bring you back to Rosemary and take you to my place.\"\\n\\n \"But if he\u0027s with another girl . . .\"\\n\\n \"Della, do I have to give you another pep talk? Because I will. You can do this. You came back here. You wanted Woods enough to come back and face this. It\u0027s time to face it, baby.\"\\n\\n He was right. I knew he was, but I was scared of what seeing Woods with someone else would do to me. I\u0027d come so far this week. I didn\u0027t want to turn into a whimpering lunatic in front of him. I wanted him to see the new and improved Della. Not the girl he had gotten rid of.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s gonna want to see you. I know you don\u0027t believe that but he will. I\u0027m a guy. I know these things.\"\\n\\n \"He may want to see me, just not when he has another . . .\" I couldn\u0027t say it.\\n\\n \"Remember, you aren\u0027t gonna let her have him tonight. You\u0027re back.\"\\n\\n I nodded. Right. I was going to take back what was mine. Even if it wasn\u0027t mine anymore, I was gonna fight like hell.\\n\\n \"Okay. Hurry before I change my mind again.\"\\n\\n \"Two more minutes,\" Tripp said with a smile.\\n\\n Those two minutes felt like hours. When Tripp finally pulled into Woods\u0027s driveway I almost wept with relief to see that his truck and my car were the only two vehicles there. That didn\u0027t mean he was alone, though. He could have brought someone there. The \"she\" in my mind still existed.\\n\\n Tripp squeezed my hand. \"Go get him,\" he said.\\n\\n I couldn\u0027t talk. I was too nervous. I just nodded and opened the car door and stepped out. I hadn\u0027t even asked Tripp if he was staying and waiting on me or if he was going back to Macon to get his motorcycle. I couldn\u0027t think about that now.\\n\\n I closed the door behind me and moved toward the stairs.\\n\\n Then he drove away. I turned back to see Tripp pulling back onto the street. He stuck his hand out of the window and waved good-bye before speeding off. He\u0027d just left me there.\\n\\n I looked back to the front door and took a deep breath. Woods was in there. I was going to plead with him for a second chance if I had to. I was going to make sure I was the woman in his bed tonight.\\n\\n The lights in the house were off. All I could see was a dim light in the bedroom. It almost looked like candlelight. Please, God, don\u0027t let it be candlelight. I gripped the railing as I walked up the stairs to the front door. He was never in bed this early. Maybe he isn\u0027t here. Maybe he\u0027s with Jace.\\n\\n I reached the top step and stood there staring at his bedroom window. I was pretty sure that it was candlelight I was seeing there. It was flickering light. This was a bad idea.\\n\\n No.\\n\\n It wasn\u0027t.\\n\\n He was mine, and I\u0027d be damned if I was going to let some other woman have him. I would shove the candlelight up her ass.\\n\\n I closed the distance between me and the door and knocked several times, then stood back and waited. If it took a while, that meant he had to get his clothes on.\\n\\n The door swung open and there he stood. He had on a pair of khaki shorts and a white button-up shirt. The sleeves were rolled up to his elbows. I loved it when he wore white. His dark skin was startling in white. I sucked in a deep, fast breath at the sight of him.\\n\\n He didn\u0027t move. We just stood there, staring at each other. It had been almost three weeks since I\u0027d left. It felt like forever since I\u0027d seen his face.\\n\\n \"Hi,\" I managed to croak out.\\n\\n \"Hi,\" he replied, still standing in the doorway, looking like a beautiful fallen angel. Who had he gotten dressed up for? My nose caught a scent from inside and I stiffened. Someone was cooking. In the dark?\\n\\n \"Can I come in?\" I asked.\\n\\n He stepped back so I could enter the house. I didn\u0027t see her yet. But I smelled the food. Maybe she isn\u0027t here yet.\\n\\n \"Are you expecting someone?\" I asked without looking back at him.\\n\\n \"Yes,\" he replied. His voice was low. He didn\u0027t want to tell me that. At least he was honest.\\n\\n \"Oh, I\u0027ll---\" I stopped myself. I almost told him I\u0027d be quick. I almost apologized. I wasn\u0027t going to do that. I was here to fight for him. Not lie down and let her have him.\\n\\n \"You should probably call her and tell her that your plans have changed,\" I said, turning around and facing him.\\n\\n Something flashed in his eyes but the stupid lights were off and I couldn\u0027t see him well enough.\\n\\n \"Why\u0027s that, Della?\" he asked as he took a step toward me.\\n\\n I stood my ground. He was hurt. I had hurt him but I was back. Dammit. I was back. \"Because if she steps foot in this house I will have to kick her ass.\" I snapped my mouth shut. I couldn\u0027t believe I\u0027d said that.\\n\\n A grin tugged at the corner of Woods\u0027s mouth as he took another step toward me. I didn\u0027t move away. I wanted him close. I wasn\u0027t going to run. \"Hmm, someone\u0027s jealous,\" he said as he reached out and ran a finger along my jawline. I shivered.\\n\\n \"Very,\" I admitted. I wasn\u0027t ashamed of it. I was livid with jealousy.\\n\\n \"Why are you jealous, Della?\" He took another step toward me, causing me to back up against the wall. His hands rested against the wall on either side of my head. \"Who would you ever have to be jealous of?\"\\n\\n I was having a difficult time breathing normally. He smelled so good. The tanned skin of his throat was right there. I wanted to lick it. Taste him. \"Anyone you touch,\" I said breathlessly.\\n\\n \"Then you only have one person to be jealous of,\" he replied, and lowered his head to nuzzle my neck. I trembled and reached up to touch his shoulders. I needed some support. There was someone else. He was admitting it. I wanted to hit him and scream and I wanted to grab his shirt and kiss him. Claim him.\\n\\n \"You left me, Della. You left me. You broke me,\" he whispered against my skin, and then ran the tip of his tongue up my neck and took a small nip at my ear.\\n\\n \"Who is she?\" I asked, needing to remind myself that he\u0027d been with someone else.\\n\\n \"Who is who?\" he asked, pressing against me as he continued his assault on my neck as if it were a delicacy he craved.\\n\\n \"Who have you . . . who are you cooking for? Who\u0027s coming here? Who have you touched?\" I asked, holding on tighter to his shoulders as my body went warm and weak.\\n\\n \"You. Always, you. Just you,\" he said, lowering his mouth to my collarbone.\\n\\n What did he mean \"me\"? \"I don\u0027t understand,\" I panted breathlessly as he ran his lips over my cleavage slowly and murmured about how good I smelled.\\n\\n \"What don\u0027t you understand, baby?\" he asked as he moved his hand from the wall to cup my right breast.\\n\\n I let out a strangled cry of pleasure. I wasn\u0027t going to be able to think clearly if he kept this up.\\n\\n \"You said there was someone else,\" I said as my body betrayed me and moved closer to him like a magnet.\\n\\n \"No, I didn\u0027t. You asked if I was expecting someone. I said yes. I was expecting you. You asked who I touched. I said only one person. You. Always you,\" he said, finally lifting his head to look at me. The heat I expected to see in his eyes wasn\u0027t what I saw. His heart was in his eyes. He loved me. It was right there for me to see. He was showing me with a look that he hadn\u0027t given up on us.\\n\\n \"You knew I was coming back,\" I said, wondering if it had been Braden or Tripp who had clued him in.\\n\\n Woods cupped my chin gently in his hand and ran his thumb over my bottom lip. \"I\u0027ve known exactly what you were doing every day since the day you left me. I\u0027ve made sure you had money to stay in hotels that were safe and food to eat. How do you think I kept from going crazy? I had daily calls to tell me how you were. Where you were. I stayed away because I wanted you to come back to me. I wanted you to want me. To want us.\"\\n\\n He had been keeping tabs on me. He had cared. He hadn\u0027t just let me leave. Tears filled my eyes and I didn\u0027t care. I wanted to cry. I was happy. I was loved.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t cry,\" he said as he began to kiss each tear from my face. \"I can\u0027t stand it when you cry. Please, don\u0027t cry.\"\\n\\n \"You love me,\" I said, smiling.\\n\\n Woods pulled back enough to look down at me. \"Della. That should have never been a question in your mind. You should have known that. If you didn\u0027t know that you had my soul, then I\u0027m doing something wrong.\"\\n\\n I reached up and grabbed his face and kissed him. With everything I had, I kissed him. I didn\u0027t have the words to make any of this right. So I showed him how I felt. How much he meant to me. His arms wrapped around me and he met each stroke of my tongue with his own. We stood there tasting and indulging in each other. It was perfect. I was home.\\n\\n When I broke the kiss so I could catch my breath I reached for his shirt. I wanted that shirt off him. I wanted his clothes off. I wanted him inside me. \"Now, I need you, now,\" I told him as I began unbuttoning his shirt.\\n\\n \"I have food. I was going to romance you first. Convince you to stay with me,\" he said as I pushed his shirt off his shoulders.\\n\\n I caressed his chest. His broad shoulders always made me feel so small but safe. \"I\u0027m hungry and we\u0027ll eat but right now I need you inside me,\" I told him as my hands got busy with the buttons on his shorts.\\n\\n \"Then come to the bedroom,\" he said, his breathing as out of control as I felt.\\n\\n \"No. I can\u0027t wait.\" I reached for my sundress and jerked it over my head. I started to push down my panties and Woods let out a growl and took over. His hands covered mine and he pulled them down, and then he ran his hands over my bottom and pressed kisses to the insides of my thighs. \"Get inside me,\" I begged. I wanted all the sweet kisses and I wanted to taste him, too, but right now I needed to be full of Woods.\\n\\n \"Fuck,\" he groaned, and stood up, turning me around to face the wall. \"You make me crazy, Della. I was gonna be romantic. You deserve romantic.\"\\n\\n \"I want you to fuck me hard. Fill me up and remind me that I\u0027m yours,\" I begged.\\n\\n Woods\u0027s body shuddered behind me just before he grabbed my hips and entered me with a yell.\\n\\n \"God, yes! So tight. So hot. This is mine,\" he said as he stopped and caressed my butt, then slapped it hard one time. \"Mine. All this is mine.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, it\u0027s yours,\" I told him, and pressed back against him.\\n\\n He let out another animalistic grunt and began moving in and out of me. With each thrust I climbed closer to the release I knew would fill me with completion.\\n\\n \"No one touches my pussy. This is my pussy, Della,\" he said in a growl before slipping his hand around me and running his fingers over my clit.\\n\\n I went off like a rocket from his touch. \"Yes! That\u0027s it, baby, come on my dick. That\u0027s my girl.\" His words made me wilder. I bucked against him and begged him to keep fucking me.\\n\\n My words caused his body to pause, then jerk again as he began chanting my name over and over. Each tremor through his body made me tingle.\\n\\n \"My Della,\" he whispered as he rested his head on my back. I moved so that he came out of me, then I turned around and pulled him into my arms.\\n\\n \"Always your Della,\" I told him.\\n\\n He held me tighter and we stood there as our bodies hummed our pleasure and our hearts healed. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/simple-perfection-perfection-2/page-32.html","bookId":1992,"book":{"id":1992,"title":"Simple Perfection (Perfection #2)","description":"Storyline: Simple Perfection (Perfection #2) \\n Woods had his perfect life mapped out for him.
