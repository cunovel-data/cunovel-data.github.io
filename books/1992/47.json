Not a good thing. He\u0027d regret that tomorrow. I walked past Jimmy, who was shaking his head with an amused grin on his face. Grant was leaning on the bar, trying to convince the new bartender that he was a congressman and demanding another drink. \"I got this,\" I told the new guy, who looked very relieved. Grant spun around and almost fell over a stool. \"Hey, Woods! It\u0027s you. Get me another shot, buddy,\" he slurred. Grant only called people buddy when he was drinking. \"Not a chance in hell,\" I replied. \"Come on, you\u0027re going home. You\u0027re done for the night.\" Grant jerked his arm out of my grasp. \"I don\u0027t wanna go home. I wanna stay here. I like it here. It\u0027s better here. If I go back to my place\"---he lowered his voice, although he was still talking really loudly---\"she will come.\" \"Who is she?\" I asked, grabbing his arm and jerking him up. I started pushing him toward the door before he could protest this time. \"She is she,\" he said, whispering loudly again. \"She is she? Really? Man, how much have you had to drink?\" Once we were outside, Grant looked around and realized we had been walking. \"Aww, damn. You tricked me. We left.\" \"Why don\u0027t you want to go to your place? You need to sleep this off.\" Grant looked around us like he was looking for someone who might be hiding and waiting for him to tell a highly important secret. \"She\u0027s Nan. Always Nan. And she\u0027s pissed. When she gets pissed she gets possessive, then naughty, then she does things and I end up letting her, but now I don\u0027t want to let her \u0027cause I don\u0027t even like her. So I can\u0027t go home.\" Nothing he had said made sense except that he didn\u0027t like Nan. Neither did the rest of the world. I was pretty damn sure there was a Twitter hashtag that said #NanHater. \"You want to crash in one of the rooms here?\" I asked him as he stumbled and sat down on a bench. \"Can I? She can\u0027t find me here. Can she?\" I was pretty sure I hadn\u0027t seen him this drunk since boarding school. Nan had done a number on him. \"You would think by now you would have learned your lesson about messing around with Nan. She\u0027s poison. Why even go near her?\" Grant let out a loud sigh and leaned forward. \"Do not puke on the damn brick. It\u0027s a country club, dickhead, not a bar.\" He lifted his head and his eyes were glassy. \"It ain\u0027t Nan that\u0027s making me drink. It\u0027s her. She\u0027s so damn . . . so damn . . . hell, I don\u0027t know what she is. She messed up my head. She fucked me over, literally. She won\u0027t see me. Won\u0027t talk to me. Nothing. She\u0027s guarded like the damn queen. Bunch of damn rock stars act like I\u0027m a problem. I\u0027m not a problem. I just want to see her. I need to explain.\" What the hell was he talking about? \"I\u0027m lost, dude. You\u0027re not making sense anymore. Come on, let\u0027s get you a room.\" \"She\u0027s got these legs that go on forever. Lots of legs . . . lots of \u0027em. They\u0027re soft. So fucking soft,\" he muttered as I jerked him up and walked him over to my truck. \"Nan?\" Grant spit. \"Fuck no. I told you this ain\u0027t about Nan. She\u0027s the evil bitch that fucked it up. She fucks up everything.\" I put him in and closed the door, then got in on my side and rolled down the windows. \"If you need to hurl do it outside of my truck,\" I told him before cranking the engine. \"She\u0027s got these legs,\" he said again. \"Yeah, you told me.\" \"You don\u0027t understand, they\u0027re like legs from fucking heaven.\" Someone had done a number on him. I was thankful it wasn\u0027t Nan. That was the only thing I was thankful for at the moment. If I could get him out of my truck without his puking, I\u0027d be thankful for that, too. \"She was a virgin,\" he whispered. Wait . . . what? \"Now I know we aren\u0027t talking about Nan.\" Grant leaned his head back on the leather seat. \"A virgin. She didn\u0027t tell me, either. Now she won\u0027t talk to me. I need her to talk to me.\" So Grant took a virgin and some rock stars are holding her captive. That doesn\u0027t make any . . . oh shit. \"Grant, are you talking about Harlow?\" \"Yeah, who the fuck did you think I was talking about?\" That might just be worse than Nan. Yeah . . . it\u0027s definitely worse than Nan. He was in deep shit. Nan would never let that happen. Ever.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/simple-perfection-perfection-2/page-47.html","bookId":1992,"book":{"id":1992,"title":"Simple Perfection (Perfection #2)","description":"Storyline: Simple Perfection (Perfection #2) Woods had his perfect life mapped out for him.
