Followed the stories about what happened in Ohio. John Smith, out there, on the run. To the world, he\u0027s a mystery. But to me . . . he\u0027s one of us. Nine of us came here, but sometimes I wonder if time has changed us—if we all still believe in our mission. How can I know? There are six of us left. We\u0027re hiding, blending in, avoiding contact with one another . . . but our Legacies are developing, and soon we\u0027ll be equipped to fight. Is John Number Four, and is his appearance the sign I\u0027ve been waiting for? And what about Number Five and Six? Could one of them be the raven-haired girl with the stormy eyes from my dreams? The girl with powers that are beyond anything I could ever imagine? The girl who may be strong enough to bring the six of us together? They caught Number One in Malaysia. Number Two in England. And Number Three in Kenya. They tried to catch Number Four in Ohio—and failed. I am Number Seven. One of six still alive. And I\u0027m ready to fight.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-power-of-six-lorien-legacies-2.jpg","author":"Pittacus Lore","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":45,"category":{"id":7,"name":"Science Fiction","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
