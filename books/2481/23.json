The maid finally broke the tempered glass and shoved her hand through. She worked and worked at it until she pushed herself all the way through and fell. It was a long, graceful sort of fall.\\n\\n Her blond hair streaming behind her. Her pink and blood colored dress hitching up over her head and shoulders. She landed feet first on the hard packed soil. Every bone in her legs shattered and she crumpled to the ground.\\n\\n Unable to get up, she began to systematically crawl toward the nearest person.\\n\\n By now a group of people were standing and watching, mesmerized.\\n\\n Juan sighed and started to walk toward her with a shovel in one hand.\\n\\n Katie cocked her shotgun.\\n\\n \"No. No guns. The sound will bring them here if they are out of the school,\" Travis said.\\n\\n \"Good point.\"\\n\\n Katie tried to look away, but couldn\u0027t. Juan casually drove the shovel through the head of the zombified maid and the drama was over.\\n\\n \"We need to build a catapult and just toss them over,\" Juan muttered as he motioned to another man to help him dispose of the body.\\n\\n Travis laughed. \"We just may.\"\\n\\n Katie turned and looked at him and slightly smiled. \"So…\"\\n\\n \"So?\"\\n\\n Jenni hovered near Katie\u0027s side, Jason right behind her. Jack looked at Katie curiously.\\n\\n \"Got anything to eat around here?\"\\n\\n \"As a matter of fact, there was supposed to be a fund raiser for the local volunteer fire department. There is so much food up in the community dining hall on the second floor of city hall, you\u0027re gonna feel like you\u0027re in heaven.\"\\n\\n Thank God,\" Jenni said with relief.\\n\\n \"So we\u0027re staying,\" Jason said.\\n\\n Katie looked at him and then at Jenni. Jenni smiled at her, her gaze flicking to Travis then back to Katie.\\n\\n \"Yeah, we\u0027re staying.\"\\n\\n \"Good. Because we need you here. I feel it,\" Travis said and he put his arms around both Jenni and Jason. \"Now, let\u0027s get you food, introduce you to the Mayor and hear your stories.\"\\n\\n Katie didn\u0027t think Jenni could get any redder or anymore giddy. She followed the little group as they moved toward the city hall not even glancing back once to see Juan and another guy loading the dead zombie onto the arm of the excavator to dump her back among her own kind.\\n\\n \"Besides,\" Katie mused. \"How the hell would we get out of here?\"\\n\\n 2. Through a Door Softly\\n\\n Jenni felt rather special walking with Travis\u0027 arm around her shoulders.\\n\\n His voice was like fine leather against her skin and she felt herself blushing.\\n\\n Behind her, Katie walked briskly holding her shotgun in one hand and her backpack in the other.\\n\\n As they neared the back entrance of city hall, Travis said, \"Hold a sec\" and released his hold on Jenni and Jason. He turned and motioned to Juan.\\n\\n The Hispanic man, his long, curly hair flowing under his baseball cap, quickly ran over. He was tall, deeply tanned and had the lean muscled build of someone who worked at hard physical labor. His dark hair had glints of red in it and his eyes were a dark green. Tucking his thumbs into his work belt, he looked at Travis expectantly. He looked weary and a little shorttempered.\\n\\n \"We have more zombies on the way. Get the harnesses ready,\" Travis said.\\n\\n \"Great. It\u0027s not like we don\u0027t have enough of them out there as it is.\"\\n\\n Juan said in his very thick West Texas accent. \"Are you sure?\"\\n\\n \"They followed the ladies here to Ashley Oaks,\" Travis assured him.\\n\\n \"They\u0027re on their way.\"\\n\\n \"Well, shit.\" Juan took a deep breath. His keen eyes flicked to Katie.\\n\\n \"Where\u0027d you pick \u0027em up?\"\\n\\n \"Emorton was overrun. It looked like the whole town was turned. They weren\u0027t too messed up so they were fast,\" Katie answered. \"I\u0027m Katie, by the way. This is Jenni and Jason.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m Juan,\" he answered and shook his head. \"We lost a man keeping them off the perimeter before.\"\\n\\n \"We learned from our mistakes. We need to keep them thinned out or we\u0027ll get overrun,\" Travis said.\\n\\n \"What are you going to do?\" Katie glanced toward the barriers then back at Travis.\\n\\n \"We\u0027re going to secure some men with safety lines and give them shovels and some homemade spears. When the zombies come up against the outer perimeter, we stand above them on the trucks and stab down through their skulls, jumble up their brains. We took out around a dozen that way before we lost a man the last time. But we didn\u0027t have the safety lines the first time out,\" Travis said, his voice tinged with sorrow.\\n\\n Juan shook his head and looked up at the darkening sky. \"Good thing we got the lights set up. And if the grid goes down, we\u0027re on backup power…\" He shook his head again. \"This is a fucked up situation.\"\\n\\n \"Just get some men ready and hooked up. First sign of trouble, we yank them back.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s like we\u0027re dangling bait in front of the zombies, Travis,\" Juan protested gruffly.\\n\\n \"They\u0027re gonna come anyway,\" Travis answered.\\n\\n \"Yeah. Yeah. Shit.\" Juan sighed heavily. \"Okay. I\u0027m on it.\"\\n\\n Jenni waited on the stairs with Jason. She felt anxious at the conversation and Jason looked unnerved. Katie looked the opposite. She seemed comforted by the words of the two men. Jenni slowly realized it was because Katie felt that at last there was a working plan of action.\\n\\n Travis clapped Juan on the shoulder. \"Keep me informed.\"\\n\\n \"You got it, Travis\" Juan said in a resigned tone and walked off.\\n\\n Travis turned and instead of resuming his comforting embrace of Jenni and Jason, he lightly touched Katie\u0027s arm. \"I want to hear about what\u0027s up with you. How you ended up here.\"\\n\\n \"Sure, but let’s eat.\" Katie gave him a slight smile. \"We\u0027re seriously hungry.\"\\n\\n With a nod of his head, Travis took hold of her arm and led her inside.\\n\\n Jenni hung back for a second to watch Juan order several men off the construction of the wall, then she followed Katie and Travis inside. She felt moody all at once and couldn\u0027t help it.\\n\\n As he had promised, there was more than enough food up in the community-dining hall. Jenni and Jason almost ran to the table and started loading up plates. Katie took her time, talking animatedly to Travis, her shotgun still in her hand. Feeling even more disgruntled, Jenni filled her plate as she tried to adjust to their new situation and environment. She sat down at a long table, one of those folding ones that they always use at social functions in churches and other organizations, to eat a plate full of all sorts of \"down home\" cooking. Katie and Travis sat down across from her all the while talking about the construction of the wall. Next to her Jason was already eating a plate full of fried chicken. Of course, Jack was under the table, eating all sorts of good scraps.\\n\\n But Jenni was confused.\\n\\n Katie and Travis were talking swiftly, voices melding seamlessly. She had been convinced that they knew each other from before all of this. There had been a look of recognition in Travis\u0027 eyes when he had stood there holding Katie\u0027s hand. But they never said \"Oh, hey it’s you!\" or anything remotely like that. It was as if some sort of invisible box had sprung up around them locking everyone out.\\n\\n And Jenni did not like that.\\n\\n Well, yeah, she definitely liked Travis. He had such a strong presence and had such sweet eyes. And she had already caught him looking at her with that special look men have for women they find attractive. She didn\u0027t find Katie a threat in that regard though she was well aware that Katie had the kind of looks men gravitated to. Katie was gay. Pure and simple. That was not even an issue.\\n\\n But Katie was her war buddy. Her new best friend. Her sister. They had spent a lot of time together. They had wept together. And Travis just appearing and just clicking with Katie-damn it all-it was making her a little nuts. She felt unbalanced by it and kept trying to get Katie to at least look at her. She felt needy and selfish and embarrassed by her feelings. It was foolish to feel this way when Katie had risked her life to help Jenni save Jason. And Jason was alive and well, sitting next to her, feeding bits of chicken skin to the dog because Katie had kept it together and got them out of the campgrounds.\\n\\n Jenni stabbed at her congealing mashed potatoes and looked up again at Katie. For a wild, irrational moment, she thought that maybe she should make herself gay to keep Katie\u0027s affections, but realized that was just stupid.\\n\\n She wasn\u0027t gay and that wasn\u0027t what this was about. Katie made her feel safe.\\n\\n She needed to feel safe.\\n\\n \"…so that is the first and utmost priority at this time. The wall,\" Katie was saying.\\n\\n \"Exactly. Then we will start to lay out plans on how to secure the two buildings that border us so we can actually inhabit them as well.\"\\n\\n \"Walling off all the ground floor windows would be a start,\" Katie suggested.\\n\\n \"And we have the bricks for it. Since the service entrance is on the side and there is no entrance off the backside, which faces our area, we\u0027ll have to bust through a wall.\" Travis was drawing on a piece of paper, more doodling than anything, but was clearly enthralled by Katie\u0027s input. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-first-days-as-the-world-dies-1/page-23.html","bookId":2481,"book":{"id":2481,"title":"The First Days (As the World Dies #1)","description":"Storyline: The First Days (As the World Dies #1) \\n Katie is driving to work one beautiful day when a dead man jumps into her car and tries to eat her.
