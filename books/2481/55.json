He wasn\u0027t too happy about Ritchie showing up or the story around it,\" Travis answered. \"Look, I know I\u0027m not one to say what does or does not happen, but I think we should just put him out of his misery and dump him over the wall. Seriously, he\u0027s nothing but a piece of white trash.\" Curtis looked more upset than Katie had ever seen him. Travis stood up and said softly, \"Curtis, this is something that we all have to discuss together. Seriously, in this world, I feel everyone has a chance. Even the local crack dealer.\" \"Meth dealer,\" Curtis corrected. Katie stood up as well and said in a low voice, \"But at the same time we need to make sure our safety isn\u0027t compromised by people who have no idea of how to work with the community.\" Travis looked at her, startled, and said, \"A human being is a human being, Katie.\" \"Yes, but at the same time, what will he add to our community? If he honestly sacrificed others to save his own life and those people were his friends, then how do we know he won\u0027t do the same to us?\" Katie looked at him very intently. \"That\u0027s bullshit, Katie. I\u0027m sorry. They are all strung up on drugs and doing stupid stuff like going into a zombie-infested clinic. They are not in their right mind.\" Travis put his hands on his hips and returned her gaze. Curtis shook his head. \"Look, Travis, I have some serious concerns and I\u0027m sure others do as well.\" \"Then we handle it as a group,\" Travis answered immediately. \"Don\u0027t get defensive if we don\u0027t agree with your point of view, Travis,\" Katie said firmly. \"I just don\u0027t understand how you could not see that everyone has a right to life,\" Travis responded. Katie shook her head and looked away from him. She ended up looking across the construction site toward the new area. There were at least four men up on the new wall shouting down at the zombies. Katie noticed one was even peeing on them. \"Travis, I think we may have other troubles,\" she said and pointed. \"Ah, shit.\" Katie watched as another man flung his empty beer bottle down at the zombies. Maybe it was because she was now aware of the situation, but she could swear the zombies were getting louder. \"I\u0027ll get Bill so we can go get them,\" Curtis said gruffly. Travis agreed with this and Curtis walked off. \"I\u0027m going to go and get them down before one of them takes a header into the crowd.\" \"I\u0027ll come with you,\" Katie answered, setting down her half-empty beer. Travis sighed and headed down the stairs. Katie followed, her hands in her jacket pockets. As they passed the closed door to her tiny room she shared with Jenni, she smiled to herself, realizing she probably was going to have to find somewhere else to sleep. Out in the courtyard, there was more commotion. Several of the older people and a few parents were talking loudly to Mike, demanding that he shut up the men on the wall. Children were trying to sleep, as were the older people. Mike was nodding, promising to do something, when Travis and Katie walked out of the city hall building with Curtis and Bill behind them. A few more men, drunk and rowdy, had climbed onto the wall next to the gate, jostling each other a little, trying to get into position to either throw things down at the zombies or urinate on them. Katie was glad she couldn\u0027t see the men\u0027s flopping penises from her viewpoint. \"Let\u0027s go,\" Travis said to Mike as he passed them. Curtis and Bill stopped long enough to promise in their best policemen voice that the situation would soon be under control, then also followed. \"Get down,\" Travis called out as he climbed up to the platform that served as an entrance to the new area. Shane, the redneck who had punched out Katie, turned and laughed. \"Ah, c\u0027mon, they just stand there with their mouths open.\" Next to him was his best buddy, Phil. \"Yeah, Travis, they\u0027re just a bunch of dead dumb fucks.\" Travis didn\u0027t step out onto the three-foot wide wall, but stood on the platform looking toward the gate. The pounding was frantic. \"You\u0027re stirring them up. Come on down.\" Several of the obviously very drunken men began to laugh. \"C\u0027mon, Travis. Stop being pussy-whipped by your lesbo girlfriend and lighten up.\" Shane whipped out his cock and waggled it at Katie before turning, drinking his beer, and urinating over the edge down onto the zombies below. Katie turned away, shaking her head. \"C\u0027mon, boys. Bring it back in,\" Bill said in a firm, authoritative voice. \"You ain\u0027t a cop no more. Back off,\" Phil answered. \"This is going to turn dirty,\" Katie whispered to Travis. \"Shut up, lesbo bitch! Who asked you to fucking open your mouth?\" Phil\u0027s voice was full of hate and his gaze was hostile. \"Nah, Phil. Let her open her mouth. I got something right here for it,\" Shane answered, flapping his cock at her. \"Gawd,\" Katie turned away again. \"Get back now,\" Bill said. His voice was going to a calm, deadly place. Travis hesitated then started to follow Katie. \"She ain\u0027t gonna give you any, Travis. She\u0027s a waste of ass,\" Shane said mockingly. \"Fuck off, Shane,\" Travis answered. Shane continued to dance around, exposing himself. Travis looked ready to go out onto the wall and punch his lights out, but Katie grabbed his arm. \"Let it go.\" \"Yeah, Travis, let it go. She don\u0027t want you. Maybe we should just bend her over and turn her back to the man side of the force,\" Phil said nastily. He began fumbling with his zipper. In his drunken state, he wavered, his foot caught, and he went tumbling forward. He hit the top of the wall sideways and began to roll off when Shane caught him. \"Oh, gawd,\" Katie murmured as Bill and Curtis rushed onto the narrow top of the wall to rescue Phil. Travis stepped back, his hand coming out to keep her behind him. Katie wasn\u0027t sure what he was thinking, but he seemed to think she needed protecting. The zombie moans and screams were increasingly loud and the banging on the gate was more energetic. Bill and Curtis managed to get a grip on Phil and with Shane\u0027s help and the help of a few others they managed to pull him up. Mike moved out onto the wall and began to corral the rest of the men back to the platform. Katie noticed that Shane and Phil avoided him and stumbled onto the platform. \"Waiting for me, baby,\" Shane sneered at her. Katie just laughed and shook her head. She turned on her heel and walked away. Without looking behind her, she knew Travis was following. He caught up to her and slid his arm around her shoulders. Looking up at him, she could see he was more upset than she was. \"Travis, I\u0027m used to it,\" she said softly. \"I\u0027m not and it was bullshit,\" Travis answered darkly. \"Let it go. It\u0027s not worth it. Lydia and I sometimes got comments like that. It\u0027s not uncommon. Some men are very intimidated by lesbians.” Travis shrugged and turned her toward him. \"Yeah, but I don\u0027t like it.\" Katie tilted her head. \"But they have a right to live here, too. And to be a part of this community.\" \"Don\u0027t twist my words back in on me,\" Travis growled. \"Look, we just have to deal, that\u0027s all,\" Katie answered, then yawned. \"Gawd, I\u0027m tired. And I have a feeling I don\u0027t have a place to sleep. Maybe Peggy can put me up.\" Travis shook his head. \"No, come with me. Sleep with me.\" \"Travis?\" She blinked. \"I said sleep. I didn\u0027t say have sex, okay?\" Katie hesitated. \"Okay.\" Travis led her toward the beat up portable building that was now a dorm. Entering it quietly, they made their way past recently constructed doors and walls that lead into tiny dorm rooms. Travis led her to a doorway at the end of a hall and opened up the door to his office. It was crowded with a desk, light table, and file cabinets. Up against the wall was a sofa that folded out into a bed. It was still rumpled from the night before, but Katie was too tired to care if it was freshly turned down or not. Sliding off her jacket, she flopped onto it and stared up at the ceiling. She felt so very tired, physically and emotionally. Shane and Phil just reminded her of all that she and Lydia had gone through together. But now she was dealing with it alone and the ache inside of her was intense. Travis shed his jacket and lay down next to her. \"I\u0027m sorry those guys are such shits.\" \"Not your fault. Just part of life,\" she answered grimly. She closed her eyes and rolled onto her side. She could sense Travis beside her and his great need to reach out and touch her. But she ignored it and squeezed her eyes shut tighter. Curling up, she wished fervently the ache inside of her would subside, but it pulsated and ate at her. \"Fuck this,\" Travis whispered and suddenly his arms were around her, dragging her deep into his embrace. He held her tightly and she clutched his wrists with her hands. \"I can\u0027t stand to see you in pain.\" Katie smiled slightly and opened her eyes. Turning her head, she gazed at him gratefully. She knew she was a bullheaded Norse, prone to moodiness and the solitary, but he bulldozed her defenses and she rather needed that.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-first-days-as-the-world-dies-1/page-55.html","bookId":2481,"book":{"id":2481,"title":"The First Days (As the World Dies #1)","description":"Storyline: The First Days (As the World Dies #1) Katie is driving to work one beautiful day when a dead man jumps into her car and tries to eat her.
