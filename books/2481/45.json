Juan had a plan to devise a new entry point using the street to the east by rigging up what he called the \"Panama Canal.” It was a simple series of walls with gates. Anyone entering by vehicle would have to drive into two locks to give guards time to shoot any zombies who slipped in as well. Then the vehicle would enter an area behind the construction site that would be walled off and enter the garage of the building that had once housed a county newspaper office and distribution center. \"So, we\u0027re expanding the wall as fast as we can. We\u0027ll use the storage containers to block off an area for safety, build the wall, then move the containers again until we have enough space.\" They would go into the hotel and the old newspaper building and clear it out, then brick up every entrance that would be facing the outside world. Everyone would be moved into the hotel. Other teams would take trucks to go into the town and bring back supplies. \"Seeds so we can plant gardens for food, as much food as possible, bedding, tools, toilet paper…\" Peggy read off a long list. Other teams would look for survivors. They would be armed, of course, and Mike would train those volunteers, since he was former army. Juan added, \"I\u0027m heading to the library. We need books on farming, medicine, weapons, warfare…\" \"We have a window of opportunity before another batch of those bastards show up,\" Travis said as the meeting continued. \"What about the army coming to rescue us?\" Curtis shook his head. \"The best news I have is that they are holed up at a rescue station in Madison and under heavy siege.\" \"We have to rescue ourselves,\" Katie said. Jenni looked over the people in the room to see that they actually did understand. There was seriousness in their features and a grim determination that gave her hope. \"Everyone just needs to do what they are good at. We need to work together. I don\u0027t want to be your leader, but someone who is helping out.\" There were murmurs of agreement to Travis\u0027 words. \"What about the lesbo bitch? Shane is locked up because of her.\" Jenni finally spot him. A tall man with dark brown hair and a heavy mustache. An older guy, grizzled and fierce. Curtis stood up slowly. \"He agrees to act like a civilized man, we\u0027ll let him out. But the rule remains. You get bit, you will be given the gift of a quick death.\" There was silence, then Rosie, Juan\u0027s mother, said, \"That is fair. And right.\" More murmurs of agreement. Travis motioned to those at the table. \"All of us are heading up some part of the fortifying of this fort. Come to us. Talk to us. Volunteer. We need to work hard to get this done.\" Jenni raised her hand as high as she could. Travis acknowledged her. \"I just want to say that in every zombie movie internal fighting is what finally let’s the zombies in to win,\" she said, and gave Travis a big smile. There was total silence at this, but Juan nodded. \"She\u0027s right. We keep it together or die.\" The grizzled old timer snorted, but shrugged. \"Fine.\" Jenni gave him a long look and leaned over to Jason. \" He\u0027ll be trouble.\" Jason nodded. \"Yeah, I know.\" The meeting finally broke up. Most of the people actually seemed relieved that there was some sort of plan. Katie stood slowly and her hand rose to her battered face. Travis turned to her to make sure she was okay. Jenni hesitated, feeling a little jealous. Katie was her best friend, not Travis\u0027. She sighed and fought the emotion. It was hard to share at times. Katie gave him a little smile. She gave Jenni an even bigger smile and Jenni grinned happily. Juan started past her. \"Hey, I\u0027m going with you,\" Jenni informed Juan. Juan stared at her for a moment, then shrugged. \"Fine. But you\u0027ll do as I say.\" Jenni smirked. \"Of course, I will.\" Katie laughed and sat back down slowly. \"I wish I could go along just to enjoy the banter.\" \"We don\u0027t banter,\" Juan said with a sniff. \"We argue,\" Jenni agreed. \"We hate each other,\" Juan added. \"Viciously,\" Jenni said with a nod. Travis regarded both of them, then looked at Katie. \"I think they\u0027re secretly dating.\" Juan sputtered and Jenni made a face. \"Yeah, definitely,\" Katie agreed. Juan and Jenni eyed each other for a moment and both shook their heads vehemently. \"I\u0027d rather date you, Travis,\" Juan said firmly. \"Oh, how cute!\" Katie laughed and wagged her finger at both the men. \"It would be a match in heaven.\" Jenni flung her arms playfully around Katie\u0027s neck as she sat on her lap. \"And I have a woman.\" Katie just giggled and missed Travis\u0027 stricken expression. If Jenni had seen, she would realized her kidding had hit a nerve, but she missed it and the two women began to joke around. Travis and Juan slipped away. \"Told you,\" Juan said simply. \"Yeah,\" Travis said glumly. \"Want to hold my hand?\" Travis snorted. \"Ha, ha.\" \"What? I\u0027m a sexy bitch!\" Travis just kept walking. 3. What Have I Become Katie felt trapped within the fort now that others were venturing out into the town. It was three days since the great battle and she was a walking bruise. Her jaw ached and her eye looked worse than ever. She was healing, but her bruises were still rising to the surface and revealing themselves in all their colorful glory. The first group to go out of the fort had returned with truckloads of food from the local grocery and survivors from the convenience store she and Travis had stopped on the way to Nerit and Ralph\u0027s. Unfortunately, they had become too confident and two zombies had dragged down one of the fort\u0027s men in the grocery store. It was a sobering moment that reminded everyone vividly that the danger still existed even though the zombies were not crowded outside their walls. It was a bitter irony to add ten new people to their company while losing another. Travis had called off any other sojourns out of the fort for another day. He enlisted Mike to once more go over gun safety and procedure, with Curtis helping him out with demonstrations. They couldn\u0027t afford to lose anyone else. As her body struggled to heal, she sat in on planning sessions for the new entrance and the taking of the hotel. Though she didn\u0027t understand all the logistics and the terminology, it became apparent that Juan and Travis were clever and resourceful. If she were well enough, she would be joining the team that was going in to clear out the hotel. Meanwhile, Jenni had volunteered to go into town to the library with Juan and had also volunteered to stand guard at night. Katie suspected Jenni was interested in standing guard due to Travis taking the late shift. It was pretty clear to her that Jenni was interested in Travis. Whether the attraction went both ways, she wasn\u0027t sure. Unable to sleep, Jack and Jason snoring loudly on the nearby cot, she slid off her bed and wandered up to the roof. The wind was cool and soft on her skin and she hugged herself to keep warm. Sitting down on a plastic chair someone had left up there, she looked up at the bright stars and sighed. It was hard to feel peace when you now knew you could kill without remorse and on pure instinct. In her mind, she replayed the image of that man, torn and bleeding, and how he had not even realized her finger was pulling back the trigger. He had been so relieved that she had saved him. Then she had truly saved him. Rubbing her hands together, she leaned forward and sighed. Staring at the rooftop between her feet, she took a deep breath of cool, fresh air. With the zombie bodies gone, she felt liberated to take deep breaths. The air was fresh once more. \"We do what we have to do,\" Lydia\u0027s voice whispered. She looked up to see Lydia sitting in the chair next to her. \"Baby?\" Lydia smiled and reached out to run her fingers lightly down her cheek. \"I\u0027m here, sweetie.\" Katie fell to her knees and wrapped her arms around Lydia\u0027s waist, clinging to her. Her cheek pressed to Lydia\u0027s lap, she began to weep. \"I\u0027m dreaming.\" \"It\u0027s okay though, isn\u0027t it?\" Lydia\u0027s long cool fingers stroked her hair gently. \"Yes, oh, yes. I was afraid I wouldn\u0027t dream of you anymore. Not after what I did.\" Lydia carefully lifted Katie\u0027s chin to gaze down at her. \"And what did you do?\" \"I killed that man. I just killed him.\" \"But you killed Jason\u0027s friend and his friend\u0027s father at the camp.\" \"They wanted me to. They were infected!\" Katie face was wet with tears. Lydia lovingly traced the contours of her face with the tips of her fingers. \"And how was this different?\" \"I just…did…it.\" Katie\u0027s voice caught and she shivered. \"And I don\u0027t…feel bad.\" Lydia nodded. \"I know, baby. And you shouldn\u0027t. You shouldn\u0027t feel bad. You saved him from my fate. You liberated him from hell. You did what you had to.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-first-days-as-the-world-dies-1/page-45.html","bookId":2481,"book":{"id":2481,"title":"The First Days (As the World Dies #1)","description":"Storyline: The First Days (As the World Dies #1) Katie is driving to work one beautiful day when a dead man jumps into her car and tries to eat her.
