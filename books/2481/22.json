I couldn\u0027t figure out why there would be race riots breaking out all over the country. Anyway, got here and already we were hearing horror stories out of the cities on the CB. Truckers were reporting all sorts of crazy stuff. We were all on edge, not sure what to think. It sounded like an April Fool\u0027s joke, but of course, this is March, not April. Juan over there kept saying over and over again it was zombies, but we all just blew it off.\" Travis shook his head and looked at Katie in the eyes. \"I mean, it sounds crazy.\"\\n\\n Katie sighed and ran a hand over her blond hair. \"Yeah, it does.\\n\\n Completely.\"\\n\\n \"Anyway, the Mayor decided that the best thing to do until we were sure of the threat was get everyone in town out to the new high school. He told us we could go ahead and start to break ground, but he wanted the civvies safe.\"\\n\\n Travis leaned toward Katie. \"The Mayor is in the back pocket of the developer, you see.\"\\n\\n \"Ohhhhhh,\" Katie said.\\n\\n \"So we went to work, but kept getting distracted by all the stories pouring in on the CB and on the radio. So, anyway, Curtis over there, that cop, comes by and tells me that there was an attack at a service station down the road and the officer on the scene had to put down the attacker he was so violent. They took the lady this freak attacked down to the clinic. He was real jittery and I didn\u0027t blame him. It all felt wrong, you know?\"\\n\\n Jenni\u0027s head was bobbing up and down furiously.\\n\\n Travis shook his head and looked past the wall into the distance. \"Just fucked up. Anyway, we start to finally get down to moving the equipment into position to start digging when we hear a big commotion down the block.\\n\\n Those cars out there just crash. Out of towner cars. And all hell is breaking loose in those cars. And we can see them rocking and hear screaming and what sounds like growling, then suddenly there are these…things…crawling out of the cars and they start running down the street toward us. Now, it\u0027s not normal for a man to have his intestines tripping his feet and he still keeps running.\"\\n\\n Katie winced at the thought and vividly remembered the first zombie to attack her. The grievous wounds on the man who had nearly dragged her out of her car had been a clear indicator that things weren\u0027t right.\\n\\n \"Four of them ran straight for us and Juan, he\u0027s a crazy son of a bitch, just sweeps them right off the road into that building over there with the arm on the excavator. The whole time he\u0027s yelling about zombies and honestly, at that point, we believed him. Two of those things didn\u0027t get up. Their heads were bashed in. But the other two, despite having arms and legs that were clearly broken, were staggering toward us. So we grabbed up some shovels and dented their heads in. About that time Curtis is back and tells me that some shit was going down at the clinic and that the dead were walking again.\\n\\n The Mayor was out in front of city hall freaking out because he saw us take out the four zombies from the cars. Now, we know the town is up at the high school, so we go over and tell the Mayor that anyone bit needs to be tossed out on their ass.\" Travis shook his head. \"Because in zombie movies…\"\\n\\n \"The bite is what makes them zombies,\" Jenni said helpfully.\\n\\n \"Yeah. And so far…well..damn…so far it was clear to me and I think everyone else that ever watched those movies that they got a lot right.\" Travis fastened his gaze steadily on Katie. \"But despite seeing it, I found it hard to believe it. But I couldn\u0027t afford not to believe.\"\\n\\n Katie agreed silently, her gaze steadily matching his. \"Yes, because you have to survive.\"\\n\\n \"Exactly. So we convince the Mayor to call the school and tell them to toss out anyone that has been bitten. Curtis can\u0027t get any of the other officers from the town on the horn. Well, there are only four cops for the whole town, but none of them answer his calls. Anyway, things are looking bad. The former Mayor of the town is now the principal over at the high school and tells the present Mayor to go fuck himself four different ways and upside down. Finally, he admits that they have bitten people in the high school and that the school nurse is taking care of them.\"\\n\\n Katie winced and shook her head. \"We went through Emorton. The school was completely filled with zombies.\"\\n\\n \"In fact, some of them are following us here. They\u0027ll probably be here in a little while,\" Jenni added.\\n\\n Travis blinked. \"Shit.\"\\n\\n \"We didn\u0027t mean for them to follow,\" Jenni said quickly.\\n\\n \"Yeah, it kinda just happened,\" Jason said helpfully from where he sat on the ground holding the dog.\\n\\n Trying to look as calm and pleasant as possible while delivering bad news, Katie said, \"Probably around twenty.\"\\n\\n Travis just ran his hand slowly through his hair and nodded. \"Okay.\\n\\n We\u0027ll deal. The wall should keep them out. Where was I? Oh, yeah. Within 15 minutes we lost all communication with the school. That is when we knew we were in for a shitload of trouble. So we quickly drove all the trucks around to block off any vulnerable areas and packed sandbags and cement bags around them. This hurricane fence here could probably hold back a good number, but if the whole town decided to come visit…\"\\n\\n \"It wouldn\u0027t be pleasant,\" Katie agreed. She looked at the newly constructed cement and brick wall. \"So you did start right away.\"\\n\\n \"About one o\u0027clock yesterday,\" Travis said. \"Been building ever since. We should have the rest up soon.\"\\n\\n Katie\u0027s gaze swept over the three buildings, her back to the road they had driven in on. Directly in front of her was an old building with advertising painted on its wall barely visible due to time and the elements. To her right was an immense building that reached skyward and looked like it was topped by maybe a penthouse, ballroom and some sort of gazebo. Looking over her shoulder to her right was the city hall with its heavy fence. Two portable buildings that were originally offices were now dorms it looked like.\\n\\n Construction workers, city workers, and a few children and women were busy helping build the new wall. There were maybe thirty people in all in the complex.\\n\\n \"I lost a lot of my crew due to them taking off for home. Can\u0027t blame them really. With all the badness going down people want to get to their families,\" Travis said softly.\\n\\n Katie shivered as she remembered Lydia.\\n\\n Travis took hold of her arm gently and rubbed it lightly. \"You okay?\"\\n\\n She knew her eyes were glistening. \"Just…\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, me, too. I\u0027m divorced so…but my parents…\"\\n\\n \"Jenni lost everyone but her stepson. I lost…\" she faltered.\\n\\n Travis\u0027 eyes were so warm, so compassionate. \"You lost your husband.\"\\n\\n Katie hesitated, but felt that something was fast developing between her and Travis. A bond…an understanding…something different. It was best to be honest.\\n\\n \"My wife.\"\\n\\n Travis\u0027 gaze dropped for a moment, but his hand did not. He rubbed her arm tenderly, then said, \"I\u0027m sorry. She had to be real special to be with you.\"\\n\\n His words unleashed something deep within her and she covered her mouth, tears springing from her eyes. She felt tears on her face. Their gaze met, strong, understanding and he put his other hand on her other arm.\\n\\n \"But she\u0027d want you to survive,\" he added.\\n\\n Jenni wrapped one arm around Katie\u0027s waist and leaned against her, trying to comfort and maybe also trying to edge in on what she saw developing before her eyes. She looked confused and Katie understood why.\\n\\n Things between men and women were black and white with Jenni. Travis and Katie just clicking on some subliminal level had to be throwing her.\\n\\n Katie nodded and looked down at her feet to regain her composure.\\n\\n Finally, she looked up at him once more. \"So you\u0027re the leader…\"\\n\\n Travis withdrew his hands slowly. \"Nah. The Mayor is. I just advise him.\"\\n\\n Katie slightly laughed and wiped a tear away. \"Uh huh.\"\\n\\n Travis leaned toward her and put one finger to his lips. \"Shhhh…\"\\n\\n \"That maid is at it again,\" a tall Hispanic man said from behind them.\\n\\n He pointed upwards and drew their attention to a window high above them.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s the old hotel. They were going to open it in a few days,\" Travis explained.\\n\\n Katie noted that the first three floors had no windows that opened up onto the construction site. But further up, windows caught the rays of the setting sun lighting them up with a purple and pink glare. Near the top floor the outline of a woman continuously battered herself against the window.\\n\\n \"She busts out the window, she\u0027s coming straight down,\" the Hispanic man decided in a thick West Texas accent.\\n\\n \"Maybe she\u0027ll land on her damn head, Juan\" Travis said.\\n\\n Katie narrowed her eyes and looked back at Travis. \"The window is cracked.\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027s been working on it for awhile. Since sometime last night. Bet she went to hide up there after being bit and… Well…\" He shrugged.\\n\\n Jenni stepped closer to Travis. \"What if there are more up there?\"\\n\\n Katie glanced at the back of the building with the faded advertising for Coca Cola on the back of it. No windows at all on its back end. Just what looked like a back entrance and that was heavily barricaded. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-first-days-as-the-world-dies-1/page-22.html","bookId":2481,"book":{"id":2481,"title":"The First Days (As the World Dies #1)","description":"Storyline: The First Days (As the World Dies #1) \\n Katie is driving to work one beautiful day when a dead man jumps into her car and tries to eat her.
