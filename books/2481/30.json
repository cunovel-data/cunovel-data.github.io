But you\u0027re scaring me.\"\\n\\n Weakly, she took hold of his wrist and forced a smile onto her lips. \"I\u0027m sure it’s nothing. Just something I ate.\"\\n\\n Then she passed out onto his lap.\\n\\n Dimly, she was aware of being carried. She heard Nerit and Ralph\u0027s voices. Another voice- the policeman, she thought-was also talking.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m afraid,\" Travis said at some point.\\n\\n They put her into a very cold bath, someone\u0027s hands keeping her head above water. She tried to talk, but felt too weak.\\n\\n \"She wasn\u0027t bit. That\u0027s not a bite,\" Ralph\u0027s voice said firmly.\\n\\n \"But there was zombie blood and guts all over that truck,\" Travis said and she heard a catch in his voice. \"What if…\"\\n\\n Katie\u0027s head swam and her body felt so hot.\\n\\n \"Katie,\" a voice insisted.\\n\\n She opened her eyes to see Lydia kneeling next to the tub, her gaze very concerned.\\n\\n \"Lydia,\" she whispered.\\n\\n \"It\u0027ll be okay. I\u0027m here. I\u0027ll be with you,\" Lydia said softly, reassuring her, kissing her brow and holding her up in the cold bath.\\n\\n Katie smiled at her feverishly. \"Then it\u0027s all going to be okay.\" She sank back down into unconsciousness.\\n\\n Travis knelt beside the tub, holding her up, tears in his eyes.\\n\\n Chapter 11\\n\\n 1. Other Voices\\n\\n Juan sat in a chair in the Mayor\u0027s office, slumped down, hands folded on his flat stomach, twiddling his thumbs, and seriously considering going and smacking Jenni a few times. Yeah, she was hot. Way hotter than the blond chick, but she had been a fucking annoyance ever since Travis and the blond had rode into the sunset together.\\n\\n It had only gotten worse when Jenni heard that Katie was very sick and Travis was worried the zombie blood and guts on the trucks lining the perimeter had contaminated her. Jenni had become downright hysterical at that news.\\n\\n \"I have to go to her! I have to! I\u0027m her best friend, don\u0027t you see! We\u0027re sisters now!\"\\n\\n Juan had to pry Jenni\u0027s fingers off the Mayor\u0027s shirt and had helped Jason carry her out of the communication center so that they could actually hear what Travis was saying over the CB. Jenni had fallen apart completely as soon as they laid her down on her cot. As far as he knew, she was still there with her son watching over her.\\n\\n He studied his thumb for a moment. He had accidentally chopped the tip off on another construction site years ago. Every once and awhile it would start throbbing. He often looked at its mutilated nail and gnarled skin when he was nervous. He was a nail biter by nature, and that deformed, bizarre half nail called to him.\\n\\n Just as he stuck the tip of his finger in his mouth, he was delivered a deft smack across the back of his head.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t do that. You look like a baby.\" His mother, Rosario, Rosie for short, stood in the doorway next to him. She was a very tiny woman with dark gray hair and very pale amber eyes. They were very sad eyes, the eyes of a woman who had lost her husband just recently to cancer.\\n\\n \"Sorry, Mom.\"\\n\\n \"Where\u0027s the Mayor? I have that list for him.\"\\n\\n \"Not sure. He told me to wait here.\"\\n\\n Rosie sighed and held the clipboard tightly to her chest. Juan had lived in the small town all his life. Well, except for the two years he had lived in Houston with his \"big, black, beautiful\" wife, Candace. But that marriage had failed when he had moved back home to be with his dad in his final years of life. Candace couldn\u0027t take the small town living and he couldn\u0027t blame her.\\n\\n They parted friends and he still talked to her every other day.\\n\\n Candace…where was she? Was she okay?\\n\\n He took off his cowboy hat and ran a hand over his hair to smooth it. It was long and curly and the heat had it frizzing terribly. He shoved the hat back on and frowned.\\n\\n \"I have the list of all the people in the fort just like the Mayor asked,\"\\n\\n Rosie said and sat down next to him.\\n\\n \"Let me see.\" He took the clipboard and read over the names. Since he both worked on the site and was from the town, he knew just about everyone on the list. Forty-two names, including Travis and Katie, who technically weren\u0027t in the fort anymore. Fifteen construction workers, five city workers, That left twenty civilians, mostly family members of local construction workers or the city workers. Well, excluding Chuck the truck driver and Jenni and Jason. And the dog.\\n\\n He liked the dog.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s sad we don\u0027t have more people here,\" he sighed and handed it back.\\n\\n \"Well, the way I see it, people went to where they thought it was safe and where they could stay with their families. My family was here, so I came here.\"\\n\\n Juan smiled at his mom and leaned over and kissed her cheek. She gave him a pat on the back of his hand.\\n\\n \"We\u0027re a diverse group,\" Rosie said after a moment. \"Statistically, it came out just like the town population. Sixty percent under the age of sixtytwo, forty percent over sixty-two. Forty percent white, forty percent Hispanic, twenty-five percent black and five percent other.\"\\n\\n \"What the hell is other anyway?\" Juan snorted with a smirk.\\n\\n \"Raymond Gutierrez is actually Navajo Indian.\" Rosie gave him a wide smile. \"Now, where do we put the dog? Do we add him as other, because he is another species or as white, since he\u0027s German.\" She sighed slightly.\\n\\n \"Though the demographic between men and women is really off. Women only make up thirty percent of those here.\"\\n\\n \"Guess I won\u0027t be dating any time soon,\" he said with a grin.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s just sad that we were so ill prepared. The city can only plan for things that seem plausible.\" She waved a hand. \"Zombies have never been a part of city planning.\"\\n\\n \"You were city secretary way too long, Mom,\" Juan decided. Her head was always full of facts and figures on the town population. \"This isn\u0027t your fault. No one could have planned for this.\"\\n\\n The present city secretary strolled in just then. Peggy was her name and Juan liked her. She was a late in life mother and her small six-year-old pressed against one leg as she moved. He couldn\u0027t blame the kid for clinging to his mom. Lord knows he had wanted to cling to Rosie a few times.\\n\\n Behind Peggy came Tobias, the city manager, and a tall black man in his late fifties. The Mayor, real name Manny Reyes, filed in last. He looked tired and worn around the edges. He moved over to his desk and sat down. All his Spanish blood made him fair and very \"gringo\", but he loved Tequila as much as Juan did. But whereas Juan knew what the hell was up, the Mayor did not.\\n\\n Manny was way too centered on being logical and finding exact answers.\\n\\n Juan knew that what was going on was not that easy to fit into a neat little box Manny could understand.\\n\\n Tobias sat down in a chair, his brow furrowed, his gaze distant. His wife was in the fort. Juan had seen her name on the list, but Tobias’ children and grandchildren lived in the town. They were not on the list.\\n\\n Curtis, looking pale and very tired, walked in and took a seat near the door. Juan felt bad for him. The rookie on the force was the last man standing. It couldn\u0027t be easy on him.\\n\\n The Mayor leaned back in his chair and his fingers picked up a pen from his desktop. He studied it and looked up. \"Well, I called all of you in here to talk about the present situation. Peggy, are you sure you want Cody in here for this?”\\n\\n Peggy gently tried to pry her child off her and he only grabbed on tighter. \"He won\u0027t budge.\"\\n\\n The Mayor nodded. \"Okay. Anyway, Travis says Katie still has a fierce fever. He told me in no uncertain terms he plans to stay until she\u0027s better or if she is infected to make sure she is at peace.\"\\n\\n \"He has it bad for her. Too bad she\u0027s gay,\" Juan said grumpily. Travis was his best friend, but had this bad tendency to fall for unattainable women.\\n\\n His mother smacked him upside the head and he knew he deserved it.\\n\\n The Mayor blinked. \"Oh, then Jenni…\" He sat still for a moment, his fingers twisting the pen. \"Oh, that makes sense now. How\u0027s she acting? \" He shrugged. \"Anyway, we need to prepare for their return.\"\\n\\n Tobias slapped the palms of his hands against his knees and leaned forward. \"How do we do that? The infected are filling that street. Most of our townspeople are out there. What we need to do is get ahold of the army and get them out here to treat those people!\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027re dead. You can\u0027t treat them,\" Juan said. He couldn\u0027t believe they were still having this conversation after all this time. Some people took denial way too far.\\n\\n \"That is a ridiculous statement. The dead do not just get up, become rabid and attack people. It has to be a virus like the CDC said in the beginning of all of this,\" Tobias said firmly.\\n\\n \"They can\u0027t be alive,\" Curtis said softly from near the door.\\n\\n \"And why do you say that?\" Tobias settled a fierce look on him.\\n\\n Curtis shrank under it, but answered, \"Because some of them are dragging their innards on the road.\"\\n\\n \"Adrenaline does strange things to people. If they have large amounts coursing their system like the CDC said in the-\"\\n\\n \"CDC took it back and called them reanimated dead,\" the Mayor pointed out. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-first-days-as-the-world-dies-1/page-30.html","bookId":2481,"book":{"id":2481,"title":"The First Days (As the World Dies #1)","description":"Storyline: The First Days (As the World Dies #1) \\n Katie is driving to work one beautiful day when a dead man jumps into her car and tries to eat her.
