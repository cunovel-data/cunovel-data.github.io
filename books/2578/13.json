{"id":93866,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"\"All right,\" Joe Castiglione said. His voice was thin, seeming to come from a great distance. \"Mo stands in and we\u0027re ready for the bottom of the fourth.\"\n Suddenly the butterflutters were in her throat as well as her stomach, and those meaty hiccups - urk-urk, urk-urk - started again. Trisha rolled away from her shelter, lurched to her knees, and threw up into the shadows between two trees, holding onto one tree with her left hand and clutch-ing her stomach with her right.\n She stayed where she was, gasping for breath and spit-ting out the taste of slightly used fiddleheads - sour, acidic - while Mo fanned on three pitches. Troy O\u0027Leary was up next.\n \"Well, the Red Sox have got their work cut out for them,\"\n Troop remarked. \"They\u0027re down seven to one in the bottom of the fourth and Andy Pettitte is twirling a gem.\"\n \"Oh sugartit,\" Trisha said, and then vomited again. She couldn\u0027t see what was coming out, it was too dark for that and she was glad, but it felt thin, more like soup than puke.\n Something about the almost-rhyme of those two words, soup and puke, made her stomach immediately knot up again. She backed away from the trees between which she had thrown up, still on her knees, and then her bowels cramped again, this time more fiercely.\n \"Oh SUGARTIT!\" Trisha wailed, tearing at the snap on the top of her jeans. She was sure she wasn\u0027t going to make it, absolutely positive, but in the end she was able to hold on just long enough to get her jeans and underwear yanked down and pulled out of the way. Everything down there came out in a hot, stinging rush. Trisha cried out and some bird in the dying light cried back, as if in mockery. When it was finally over and she tried to get on her feet, a wave of lightheadedness struck her. She lost her balance and plopped back down in her own hot mess.\n \"Lost and sitting in my own crap,\" Trisha said. She began to cry again, then also to laugh as it struck her funny. Lost and sitting in my own crap indeed, she thought.\n She struggled up, crying and laughing, her jeans and underwear puddled around her ankles (the jeans were torn at both knees and stiff with mud, but at least she\u0027d avoided dipping them in shit... so far, anyway). She pulled her pants off and walked to the stream, naked from the waist down and holding her Walkman in one hand. Troy O\u0027Leary had singled around the time she lost her balance and plopped into her own poop; now as she stepped barefoot into the freezing cold stream, Jim Leyritz hit into a double play. Side retired. Utterly SECK-shoo-al.\n Bending, getting water and splashing it onto her fanny and the backs of her thighs, Trisha said: \"It was the water, Tom, it was the damn old water, but what was I supposed to do? Just look at it?\"\n Her feet were completely numb by the time she stepped out of the stream; her backside was also pretty numb, but at least she was clean again. She put on her underwear and her pants and was just doing the snap on the jeans when her stomach clenched again. Trisha took two big steps back to the trees, clutched the same one, and vomited again. This time there seemed to be nothing solid in it at all; it was like eject-ing two cups of hot water. She leaned forward and put her forehead against the pine tree\u0027s sticky bark. For just a moment she could imagine a sign on it, like the kind people hung over the doors of their lakeside and seaside camps: TRISHA\u0027S PUKIN\u0027 PLACE. That made her laugh again, but it was bad laughter.\n And through all the air between these woods and the world she had so foolishly believed was hers, that jingle was playing again, the one that went \"Dial 1-800-54-GIANT.\"\n Now her bowels again, tightening and cramping.\n \"No,\" Trisha said, with her forehead still against the tree and her eyes closed. \"No, please, no more. Help me, God.\n Please no more.\"\n Don\u0027t waste your breath, said the cold voice. It\u0027s no good praying to the Subaudible.\n The cramp loosened. Trisha walked slowly back to her shelter on legs that felt rubbery and unstable. Her back hurt from vomiting; her stomach muscles felt oddly sprung.\n And her skin was hot. She thought maybe she had a fever.\n Derek Lowe came in to pitch for the Red Sox. Jorge Posada greeted him with a triple into the right-field corner.\n Trisha crawled into her shelter, being careful not to brush any of the branches with her arm or hip. If she did that the whole thing would probably fall over. If she was caught short again (that\u0027s what her Mom called it; Pepsi called it \"having the Hershey squirts\" or \"doing the outhouse polka\"), she\u0027d probably knock it all over, anyway. Meantime, though, she was in here.\n Chuck Knoblauch hit what Troop called \"a towering fly ball.\" Darren Bragg caught it, but Posada scored. Eight to one, Yankees. She was on a roll tonight, no doubt about it.\n On an absolute roll.\n \"Who do you call when your windshield\u0027s busted?\" she sang under her breath as she lay on the pine needles.\n \"1-800-54-GI - \"\n A sudden spasm of the shivers took her; instead of hot and feverish, she felt cold all over. She grabbed her muddy arms with her muddy fingers and held on, hoping the branches she had so carefully set up wouldn\u0027t all fall down on top of her.\n \"The water,\" she moaned. \"The water, the damned old water, no more of that.\"\n But she knew better, and didn\u0027t need the cold voice to tell her anything. She was already thirsty again, vomiting and the aftertaste of fiddleheads had made the thirst even stronger, and she would be revisiting the stream soon enough.\n She lay listening to the Red Sox. They woke up in the eighth, scoring four runs and chasing Pettitte. While the Yan-kees batted against Dennis Eckersley in the top of the ninth (\"the Eck\" was what Joe and Troop called him), Trisha gave in - she couldn\u0027t stand listening to the daffy babble of the stream any longer. Even with the Walkman\u0027s volume turned up it was there, and her tongue and throat begged for what she was hearing. She backed carefully out of the shelter, went to the stream, and drank again. It was cold and deli-125 cious, tasting not like poison but like the nectar of the gods.\n She crawled back to her shelter, alternately hot and cold, sweaty and shivery, and as she lay down again she thought, I\u0027ll probably be dead by morning. Dead or so sick I\u0027ll wish I was dead.\n The Red Sox, now down by a score of eight to five, loaded the bases with just one out in the bottom of the ninth.\n Nomar Garciaparra hit a deep drive to center field. If it had gone out, the Sox would have won the game by a score of nine to eight. Instead, Bernie Williams made a leaping grab at the bullpen wall and snared Garciaparra\u0027s bid. One run scored on the sacrifice fly, but that was all. O\u0027Leary came up and struck out against Mariano Rivera, completing an undistinguished night and ending the game. Trisha pushed the power button on her Walkman, saving the batteries.\n Then she began to cry, weakly and helplessly, with her head in her crossed arms. She was sick to her stomach and queasy in her bowels; the Sox had lost; Tom Gordon never even got in the stupid game. Life was the puppy-shits. She was still crying when she fell asleep.\n At the Maine state police barracks in Castle Rock, a short telephone call came in just as Trisha was going against her better judgment and drinking from the stream for the sec-ond time. The caller gave his message to the operator and to the tape-recorder which preserved all incoming calls.\n Call commences 2146 Hours Caller: The girl you\u0027re looking for was snatched off the trail by Francis Raymond Mazzerole, that\u0027s M as in microscope.\n He\u0027s thirty-six years old, wears glasses, has short hair dyed blond. Got that?\n Operator: Sir, can I ask you to - Caller: Shut up, shut up, listen. Mazzerole is driving a blue Ford van, what I think is called an Econoline. He is in Con-necticut by now at least. He is a bad scumbag. Run his record and you\u0027ll see. He\u0027ll fuck her a few days if she doesn\u0027t give him any trouble, you could have a few days, but then he\u0027ll kill her. He\u0027s done it before.\n Operator: Sir, do you have a license number - Caller: I gave you his name and what he\u0027s driving. I gave you all you need. He\u0027s done this before.\n Operator: Sir - Caller: I hope you kill him.\n Call ends 2148 Hours Traceback put the origin of the call at a pay telephone in Old Orchard Beach. No help there.\n Around two o\u0027clock the next morning - three hours after police in Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, and New Jersey had begun looking for a blue Ford van driven by a man with short blond hair, wearing eyeglasses - Trisha awoke with more nausea and cramps. She knocked her shel-ter over backing out of it, fumbled her jeans and underwear down, and voided what seemed like a huge quantity of weak acid. It hurt her down there, hurt with a deep itching sting that felt like the worst case of prickly heat she\u0027d ever had.\n When that part was over she crawled back to Trisha\u0027s Pukin\u0027 Place and grabbed hold of the same tree. Her skin was hot, her hair was matted with sweat; she was also shak-ing all over and her teeth were chattering.\n I can\u0027t vomit any more. Please God, I can\u0027t vomit any more. It\u0027ll kill me if I go on vomiting.\n This was when she actually saw Tom Gordon for the first time. He was standing in the woods about fifty feet away, his white uniform seeming almost to burn in the moonlight which fell through the trees. He was wearing his glove. His right hand was behind his back and Trisha knew there was a baseball in it. He would be cupping it against his palm and twirling it in his long fingers, feeling the seams go by, stop-ping only when they were exactly where he wanted them and the grip was right.\n \"Tom,\" she whispered. \"You never got a chance tonight, did you?\"\n Tom took no notice. He was looking in for the sign.\n That stillness spun out from his shoulders, enveloping him. He stood there in the moonlight, as clear as the cuts on her arms, as real as the nausea in her throat and belly, all those nasty butterflutters. He was stillness waiting for the sign. Not perfect stillness, there was that hand behind his back turning the ball and turning the ball, searching for the best grip, but all stillness where you could see; yeah, baby, stillness waiting for the sign. Trisha wondered if she could do that - just let the shakes run off her like water off a duck\u0027s back and be still and conceal the churning inside her.\n She held onto the tree and tried. It didn\u0027t happen all at once (good things never did, her Dad said), but it did hap-pen: quiet inside, blessed stillness. She stayed that way for a long time. Did the batter want to step out because he thought she was taking too long between pitches? Fine. It was nothing to her, one way or the other. She was only still-ness, stillness waiting for the right sign and the right grip on the ball. Stillness came from the shoulders, it spun out from there, it cooled you and focused you.\n The shivers eased, then stopped entirely. At some point she realized that her stomach had also settled. Her bowels were still crampy, but not as bad now. The moon was down.\n Tom Gordon was gone. Of course he had never really been there at all, she knew that, but - \"He sure looked real that time,\" she croaked. \"Real as real. Wow.\"\n She got up and walked slowly back to the tree where her shelter had been. Although she wanted nothing except to huddle on the pine needles and go to sleep, she set up the fans of branches again, then crawled in behind them. Five minutes later she was dead to the world. As she slept, some-thing came and watched her. It watched for a long time. It was not until light began to line the horizon in the east that it went away... and it did not go far.\n Sixth Inning\n WHEN TRISHA woke up, the birds were singing confidently.\n The light was strong and bright, the way it looked at mid-morning.\n She might have slept even longer, but hunger wouldn\u0027t allow it. She roared with a vast emptiness from the top of her throat all the way down to her knees. And in the very middle it hurt, actually hurt. It was as if she were being pinched somewhere inside. The feeling frightened her. She had been hungry before, but never hungry enough for it to hurt this way.\n She backed out of her shelter, knocking it over again, got to her feet, and hobbled to the stream with her hands planted in the small of her back. She probably looked like Pepsi Robichaud\u0027s grandmother, the one who was deaf and had arthritis so bad she had to use a walker. Granny Grunt, Pepsi called her.\n Trisha got down on her knees, planted her hands, and drank like a horse at a trough. If the water made her sick again, and it probably would, so be it. She had to put some-thing in her stomach.\n She got up, looked dully around her, hitched up her jeans 131. (they had been okay when she put them on, long ago and far away in her Sanford bedroom, but they were loose now), then started downhill along the course of the stream. She no longer had any real hope that it would take her out, but at least she could put some distance between her and Trisha\u0027s Pukin\u0027 Place; she could do that much.\n She had gotten perhaps a hundred paces when the tough tootsie spoke up. Forgot something, didn\u0027t you, sugar? Today the tough tootsie also sounded like a getting-tired tootsie, but her voice was as cold and ironic as ever. Not to mention cor-rect.\n Trisha stood where she was for a moment with her head down and her hair hanging, then turned around and labored uphill to her little camp of the night before. She had to stop twice on the way and give her pounding heart a chance to slow down; she was appalled by how little strength she had left.\n She filled her water-bottle, stuffed it and the shredded remains of her poncho into her pack, gave a tearful sigh at the pack\u0027s weight when she lifted it (the damned thing was all but empty, for goodness\u0027 sake), and then set off again. She walked slowly, almost plodding now, and although the going was downhill she still had to stop and rest every fif-teen minutes or so. Her head throbbed. All the world\u0027s col-ors looked too bright, and when a bluejay called from a branch overhead, the sound seemed to punch into her ears like needles. She pretended Tom Gordon was with her, keeping her company, and then after awhile she didn\u0027t have to pretend anymore. He walked along beside her, and although she knew he was a hallucination, he looked as real by daylight as he had by moonlight.\n Around noon, Trisha stumbled over a rock and sprawled full-length in a brambly snarl of bushes. She lay there with the breath knocked out of her and her heart hammering so hard it made white lights in front of her eyes. The first time she attempted to drag herself back to open ground she couldn\u0027t do it. She waited, rested, tried for stillness with her eyes half-closed, and then went for it again. This time she pulled herself free, but when she tried to get up, her legs wouldn\u0027t support her. No wonder, either, not really. Over the last forty-eight hours she\u0027d had nothing to eat but a hardboiled egg, a tuna sandwich, two Twinkies, and a few fiddleheads. She\u0027d also had diarrhea and vomiting.\n \"I\u0027m going to die, Tom, aren\u0027t I?\" she asked. Her voice was calm, lucid.\n There was no answer. Trisha raised her head and looked around. Number 36 was gone. Trisha dragged herself over to the stream and had a drink. The water didn\u0027t seem to be bothering her stomach and bowels anymore. She didn\u0027t know if that meant she was getting used to it or just that her body had given up trying to rid itself of the bad stuff, the impurities. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-girl-who-loved-tom-gordon/page-13.html","bookId":2578,"book":{"id":2578,"title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","description":"Storyline: \n Nine-year-old Trisha McFarland strays from the path while she and her recently divorced mother and brother take a hike along a branch of the Appalachian Trail.
