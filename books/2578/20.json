{"id":93873,"no":20,"title":"Page 20","content":"While she slept something had dug a circle through the leaves and needles and underbrush surrounding the aban-doned truck cab. It was perfectly clear in the morning light, a curving line of wet black earth in the greenery. Bushes and small trees which had been in the way had been torn out by the roots and thrown aside in broken pieces. The God of the Lost had come and drawn a circle around her as if to say, Stay clear - she is mine, she is my property. Top of the Ninth TRISHA WALKED all that Sunday with the low, hazy sky beating down on her. In the morning the wet woods steamed, but by early afternoon they were dry again. The heat was immense. She was still glad of the road, but now she wished for shade, as well. She felt feverish again, and not just tired but outright exhausted. The thing was watching her, pacing her through the woods and watching her. The feeling didn\u0027t leave her this time because the thing didn\u0027t leave her. It was in the woods to her right. A couple of times she thought she actually saw it, but perhaps that was only the sun moving through the tree-branches. She did not want to see it; she had seen all that she wanted to in that single flash of lightning the night before. The fur of it, the enormous cocked ears of it, the hulk of it. The eyes, too. Those black eyes, big and inhuman. Glassy but aware. Aware of her. It won\u0027t leave until it\u0027s sure I can\u0027t get out, she thought wearily. It\u0027s not going to let that happen. It\u0027s not going to let me get away. Shortly after noon she saw that the puddles in the road-191. ruts were drying up and replenished her water supply while she could, straining the water through her hat and into the hood of her poncho, then pouring it into the plastic bottles. The water still had a hazy, dirty look, but such things no longer caused her much concern. She thought if woods-water was going to kill her, she probably would have died when it first made her sick. What did concern her was lack of food. She ate all but the last few nuts and berries after fill-ing her bottles; by breakfast tomorrow she would be scrounging at the bottom of the pack, as she had scrounged for the last few potato chips. She might find more stuff alongside the road, but she wasn\u0027t hopeful. The road went on and on, sometimes fading a little and sometimes clarifying for a few hundred yards. For awhile bushes grew up on the crown between the ruts. Trisha thought they were blackberry bushes - they looked like the ones from which she and her Mom had picked hatfuls of fresh sweet berries in the Sanford toy woods, but it was a month too early for blackberries. She also saw mushrooms, but did not trust any enough to eat them. They weren\u0027t in her mother\u0027s field of knowledge, nor had they studied them in school. In school they had learned about nuts and not taking rides from strangers (because some strangers were nuts), but not mushrooms. The one thing she was sure of was that you would die - and horribly - if you ate the wrong kind. And skipping them was really no big sacrifice. She now had little appetite, and her throat was sore. Around four in the afternoon she stumbled over a log, fell on her side, tried to get up, and found she couldn\u0027t. Her legs were trembling and felt as weak as water. She took off her pack (struggling with it for an alarming length of time), and finally got free of it. She ate all but the last two or three beechnuts, almost gagging up the last one she attempted. She fought for it and won, stretching her neck like a baby bird and double-gulping. She tamped it down (at least for the time being) with a swig of warm, gritty water. \"Red Sox time,\" she muttered, and dug out her Walk-man. She doubted if she could pick them up, but it wouldn\u0027t hurt to try; it would be one o\u0027clock or so on the West Coast, a sure day game, and just starting. There was nothing at all on the FM band, not even a faint whisper of music. On the AM she found a man babbling rapidly away in French (he chuckled as he did so, which was disquieting), and then, down near 1600, at the very foot of the dial, a miracle: faint but audible, the voice of Joe Cas-tiglione. \"All right, Valentin leads away from second,\" he said. \"The three-one pitch... and Garciaparra hits a long high drive to deep center field! It\u0027s back... it\u0027s GONE! Red Sox lead, two to nothing!\" \"Way to go, Nomar, you the man,\" Trisha said in a hoarse, croaky voice she hardly recognized as her own, and pumped her fist weakly at the sky. O\u0027Leary struck out and the inning ended. \"Who do you call when your WINDshield\u0027s BUSted?\" sang voices from a world far away, one where there were paths everywhere and all gods worked behind the scenes. \"1-800,\" Trisha began. \"54...\" She trailed off before she could finish. As her doze deep-ened she slid further and further to her right, coughing from time to time. The coughs had a deep, phlegmy sound. Dur-ing the fifth inning, something came to the edge of the woods and looked at her. Flies and noseeums made a cloud around its rudiment of a face. In the specious brilliance of its eyes was a complete history of nothing. It stood there for a long time. At last it pointed at her with one razor-claw hand - she is mine, she is my property - and backed into the woods again. Bottom of the Ninth AT SOME POINT late in the game, Trisha thought she came briefly, blearily awake. Jerry Trupiano was announcing - it sounded like Troop, at least, but he was saying that the Seat-tle Monsters had the bases loaded and Gordon was trying to close the game out. \"That thing at the plate\u0027s a killer,\" Troop said, \"and Gordon looks afraid for the first time this year. Where\u0027s God when you need him, Joe?\" \"Danvizz,\" Joe Castiglione said. \"Crying real tizz.\" Surely that was a dream, had to have been - one that might or might not have been mixed with a little smidge of reality. All Trisha knew for sure was that when she next awoke completely, the sun was almost down, she was fever-ish, her throat hurt badly each time she swallowed, and her radio was ominously quiet. \"Fell asleep with it on, you stupid thing,\" she said in her new croaky voice. \"You big dumb asshole.\" She looked at the top of the case, hoping to see the little red light, hoping she had just moved the tuning by accident when she started sliding off to one side (she had awakened with her head 195. cocked against one shoulder and her neck aching fiercely), knowing better. And sure enough, the red light was out. She tried to tell herself the batteries couldn\u0027t have lasted much longer, anyway, but it didn\u0027t help and she cried some more. Knowing the radio was dead made her feel sad, so sad. It was like losing your last friend. Moving slowly and creakily, she stowed the radio back in her pack, did the buckles, and put the pack back on. It was almost empty, yet seemed to weigh a ton. How could that be? I\u0027m on a road, at least, she reminded herself. I\u0027m on a road. But now, with the light of another day slipping out of the sky, not even that seemed to help. Road, shmoad, she thought. The fact of it actually seemed to mock her, began to seem like a blown save opportunity, somehow - like when a team got just an out or two away from sewing up the win and then the roof fell in. The stupid road could go on through these woods for another hundred and forty miles, for all she knew, and at the end of it there might be nothing; just another scruff of bushes or another hideous bog. Nevertheless she began to walk again, slowly and wearily, with her head down and her shoulders so slumped that the pack-straps kept trying to slip off like the straps of a shell did if the top was too big. Only with a shell top, you only had to brush the straps back up. With the pack-straps you first had to pick and then lift. About a half hour before full dark, one of them slipped off her shoulder entirely and the pack came askew. Trisha thought briefly of just letting the damned thing fall and walking on without it. She might have done just that if there had only been the last handful of checkerberries inside. But there was the water, and the water, gritty as it was, soothed her throat. She decided to stop for the night instead. She knelt down on the crown of the road, slipped off the pack with a sigh of relief, then lay down with her head on it. She looked at the dark mass of the woods to her right. \"You just stay away,\" she said as clearly as she could. \"Stay away or I\u0027ll dial 1-800 and call the giant. Do you understand me?\" Something heard her. It might or might not understand, and it did not reply, but it was there. She could feel it. Was it still letting her ripen? Feeding on her fear before it came out to feed on her? If so, the game was almost over. She was nearly out of fear. She thought suddenly of calling to it again, of telling it she didn\u0027t mean what she\u0027d just said, that she was tired and it could come get her if it wanted. But she didn\u0027t do it. She was afraid that it might take her up on it if she did. She drank a little water and looked up at the sky. She thought of Bork the Dork saying the God of Tom Gordon couldn\u0027t be bothered with her, that He had other fish to fry. Trisha doubted if that was exactly so... but He wasn\u0027t here, that seemed certain. Maybe it wasn\u0027t couldn\u0027t so much as wouldn\u0027t. Bork the Dork had also said, I must admit he is a sports fan... not necessarily a Red Sox fan, however. Trisha took off her Red Sox cap - now battered and sweatstained and smeared with bits of the forest - and ran her finger across the bent brim. Her best thing. Her father had gotten Tom Gordon to sign it for her, had sent it to Fen-way Park with a letter saying Tom was his daughter\u0027s favorite player, and Tom (or his accredited representative) had sent it back in the stamped, self-addressed envelope her father had provided, autographed across the visor. She guessed it was still her best thing. Other than some murky water, a handful of dried, tasteless berries, and her dirty clothes, it was just about her only thing. And now the signa-ture was gone, blurred to nothing but a black shadow by rain and her own sweaty hands. But it had been there, and she was still here - for the time being, at least. \"God, if You can\u0027t be a Red Sox fan, be a Tom Gordon fan,\" she said. \"Can you do that much, at least? Can you be that much?\" She dozed in and out of consciousness all night, shiver-ing, falling asleep and then snapping awake, sure that it was there with her, It, that it had finally come out of the woods to take her. Tom Gordon spoke to her; once her father also spoke to her. He stood right behind her, asking her if she\u0027d like some macaroons, but when she turned around no one was there. More meteors burned across the sky, but she couldn\u0027t tell for sure if they were really there or if she was only dreaming them. Once she took out her radio, hoping the batteries had come back a little - sometimes they did, if you gave them a chance to rest - but she dropped it into the high grass before she could check and then couldn\u0027t find it no matter how much she combed her fingers through the tangles. Eventually her hands returned to her pack and felt the straps still threaded snugly through the buckles. Trisha decided she had never taken the radio out in the first place, because she never could have refixed the buckles and straps so neatly in the dark. She hacked her way through a dozen coughing fits, and now they hurt way down in her ribcage. At some point she hoisted herself up enough to pee, and what came out was hot enough to burn and make her bite her lips. The night passed as nights of deepening sickness always do; time grew soft and strange. When the birds at last began to chirrup and she saw a little light beginning to strain through the trees, Trisha could hardly believe it. She lifted her hands and looked at her dirty fingers. She could hardly believe she was still alive, either, but it seemed she was. She stayed put until the day was light enough to see the ever-present cloud of bugs around her head. Then she got slowly up and waited to see if her legs were going to support her or give way and spill her back down again. If they do I\u0027ll crawl, she thought, but she didn\u0027t have to crawl, not yet; they held her. She bent and hooked a hand into one of the pack-straps. When she straightened back up again, dizziness roared through her and a squadron of those black-winged butterflies clouded her sight. At last they faded and she managed to get the pack on. Then there was another problem - which way had she been going? She was no longer entirely sure, and the road looked the same in both directions. She stepped away from the log, looking uncertainly back and forth. Her foot clipped something. It was her Walkman, all tangled up in the ear-phone cord and wet with dew. Apparently she had taken it out after all. She bent down, picked it up, and looked at it stupidly. Was she going to take off the pack again, open it, and put the Walkman back inside? That seemed too hard - on a par with moving a mountain. On the other hand, throwing it away seemed wrong, like admitting she had given up. Trisha stood where she was for three minutes or more, looking down at the little radio-tape player with her fever-bright eyes. Throw it away or keep it? Throw it away or keep it? What\u0027s your decision, Patricia, do you want to stick with the waterless cookware or go for the car, the mink coat, and the trip to Rio? It occurred to her that if she were her brother Pete\u0027s Mac PowerBook, she\u0027d be throwing up error messages and little bomb icons all over the place. She was startled into a laugh at this image. The laughter almost immediately turned into coughing. It was the worst bout by far, doubling her over. Soon she was barking like a dog with her hands planted just above her knees and her hanging hair swaying back and forth in a filthy curtain. She somehow kept her feet, refusing to give in and fall, and as the coughing fit was tapering off, she real-ized that she ought to clip the Walkman to the waistband of her jeans. That was what the clip on the back of the case was for, wasn\u0027t it? Sure, you bet. What an El Dopo she was. She opened her mouth to say, Elementary, my dear Watson - she and Pepsi sometimes said that to each other - and when she did, something wet and warm came slobber-ing out over her lower lip. She wiped up a palmful of bright red blood and looked at it, her eyes widening. I must have bit something in my mouth when I was coughing, she thought, and immediately knew better. This had come from deeper inside. The idea scared her, and fright brought the world into sharper focus. She found herself able to think again. She cleared her throat (gently; it hurt too much to do it any other way) and then spat. Bright red. Oh jeez, Louise, but there was nothing she could do about it now, and at least she was clearheaded enough to figure out how to make sure of her direction on the road. The sun had gone down on her right. She turned now until the rising sun was winking through the trees on her left, and immediately saw she was pointed the right way. She didn\u0027t know how she could have been confused in the first place. Slowly, gingerly, like someone walking on a freshly rinsed tile floor, Trisha got moving again. This is probably it, she thought. Today\u0027s probably my last chance, maybe even this morn-200 ing\u0027s my last chance. I may be too weak and sick to walk by this afternoon, and if I can get on my feet after another night out here, it\u0027ll be a blue-eyed miracle.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-girl-who-loved-tom-gordon/page-20.html","bookId":2578,"book":{"id":2578,"title":"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon","description":"Storyline: Nine-year-old Trisha McFarland strays from the path while she and her recently divorced mother and brother take a hike along a branch of the Appalachian Trail.
