{"id":2577,"title":"I, Zombie","description":"Storyline: ***WARNING: NOT FIT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION*** \\n This book contains foul language and fouler descriptions of life as a zombie. It will offend most anyone, so proceed with caution or not at all. \\n And be forewarned: This is not a zombie book. This is a different sort of tale. It is a story about the unfortunate, about those who did not get away. It is a human story at its rotten heart. It is the reason we can\u0027t stop obsessing about these creatures, in whom we see all too much of ourselves.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/i-zombie.jpg","author":"Hugh Howey","type":"Horror","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","category":{"id":2,"name":"Horror","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
