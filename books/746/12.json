{"id":29542,"no":12,"title":"XII. THE INTOLERANCE OF THE LITTLE BANTAM.","content":"When I did not play with my dolls, I made little chapels and altars in all the corners of the house. I made myself a chasuble out of my mother’s apron, and I sang away, as loudly as ever I could, all the hymns I knew by heart, and many that I composed for the occasion. My father said nothing to this, because he thought that, after all, a child must amuse itself in some way; however, I generally chose the days when he was out, and my grands services took place always when he went out fishing. On those days I felt I was free, gay, and happy. I sang my most beautiful anthems, composed of any words that came into my head, terminating in us or um; and the house resounded with the noise of my bell. \\n\\n \\n\\n But the procession, consisting of myself alone, did not go beyond the different rooms and the kitchen. I did not go into the loft, because who ever heard of a grand imposing ceremony taking place in a loft? I would, however, have gladly gone into the garden to ask a blessing upon our rose trees, and the one apricot tree which grew there, but which never had any apricots on it; only the notorious intolerance of that little bantam-cock prevented the procession venturing out of doors. \\n\\n \\n\\n When I met my mother, as I marched about the passages in pomp, she would smile kindly at me, and kiss me as I passed. Then I would whisper in her ear, “Mamma, I should like to be a priest.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “And why not, my darling,” would be her reply, “if it is your vocation?” \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1958/56159.html","bookId":746,"book":{"id":746,"title":"Coward or Hero?","description":"简介： Now then!
