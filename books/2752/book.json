Even Echo can\u0027t remember the whole truth of that horrible night. All she knows is that she wants everything to go back to normal. \n But when Noah Hutchins, the smoking-hot, girl-using loner in the black leather jacket, explodes into her life with his tough attitude and surprising understanding, Echo\u0027s world shifts in ways she could never have imagined. They should have nothing in common. And with the secrets they both keep, being together is pretty much impossible. \n Yet the crazy attraction between them refuses to go away. And Echo has to ask herself just how far they can push the limits and what she\u0027ll risk for the one guy who might teach her how to love again.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/pushing-the-limits-pushing-the-limits-1.jpg","author":"Katie McGarry","type":"Young Adult","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":51,"category":{"id":9,"name":"Young Adult","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
