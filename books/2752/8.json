She’s on the dance team, advanced classes, honor roll, art guru, Miss Popularity, and she’s got Luke Manning feeling her up between classes. One month before school lets out—she disappears.” Beth’s eyes widened and she spread her fingers out like a magician doing a trick.\\n\\n This was not where I thought this story would go. Isaiah watched my reaction and nodded. “Poof.”\\n\\n “Gone,” added Beth.\\n\\n “Vanished,” said Isaiah.\\n\\n “Lost.”\\n\\n “Evaporated.”\\n\\n “Gone,” repeated Beth. Her eyes glazed over and she stared down at her toes.\\n\\n “Beth,” I prodded.\\n\\n She blinked. “What?”\\n\\n “The story.” This was the problem with hanging out with stoners. “Echo. Continue.”\\n\\n “Oh, yeah, so she disappeared,” said Beth.\\n\\n “Poof,” added Isaiah.\\n\\n Not this again. “I got it. Moving along.”\\n\\n “She comes back junior year a completely different person— like Body Snatcher different. It’s still Echo, right? She’s got red curly hair and a rockin’ body,” said Beth.\\n\\n Isaiah laughed. “You just called her body rocking.”\\n\\n Beth threw a pillow at him before continuing, “But she’s not Miss Social anymore. Luke and her are history. He moved on to some other girl. Though the rumor is she broke up with him before her disappearance. She quits the dance team, stops entering art contests and barely talks to anyone. Not that I would have talked to anyone either, the way rumors flew around about her.”\\n\\n “The gossip was brutal, man,” said Isaiah. Beth, Isaiah and I understood gossip. Foster kids and those from bad homes lay low for a reason.\\n\\n “What did they say?” I had a sinking feeling where this conversation was headed and it didn’t sit well with me.\\n\\n Beth wrapped her arms around her knees. “On the first day of our junior year she came back wearing a long-sleeve shirt and the same thing the day after that and on and on. It was ninety degrees for the first three weeks of school. What do you think people said?”\\n\\n Isaiah made a circling motion with his finger. “Her little friends circled the wagons and kept her out of sight.”\\n\\n “And she started meeting with the school counselor.” Beth paused. “You gotta feel bad for her.”\\n\\n My eyes had been drifting closed, but Beth’s statement shocked them open. “What?” Beth lacked the sympathy gene.\\n\\n She lay down on the bed, her eyes fluttering. “Obviously something fucked-up happened to her. Plus, her brother died a couple of months before she disappeared. They were super close. He was only three years older than her and took her to parties and stuff when he was in town. I used to hate her for having an older brother who cared.” Now Beth’s eyes shut completely.\\n\\n Isaiah stood. “Roll over.”\\n\\n Beth rolled against the wall. Isaiah grabbed a blanket off the floor and draped it over her. Our storyteller passed out.\\n\\n Isaiah joined me on the couch. “Most people call Echo a cutter. Some said she tried to commit suicide.” He shook his head. “It’s all messed up, man.”\\n\\n I was tempted to say I agreed and tell him what happened at the library, but I didn’t. “What happened to her brother?”\\n\\n “Aires? He was a good guy. Cool to everyone. Joined the Marines out of high school and got himself blown to hell over in Afghanistan.”\\n\\n Aires and Echo Emerson. Their mother must have hated them to give them names like that. Now I needed to find a way to make nice with the girl. She was my ticket to getting my brothers back.\\n\\n Echo\\n\\n I held Noah’s black leather jacket over my arm and headed toward my locker. The temptation to wear it overwhelmed me. I loved the way it smelled, how warm it made me feel and how it reminded me of our moment together outside Michael Blair’s house.\\n\\n Get a grip, Echo. You’re not an idiot. I knew the gossip regarding Noah. He only attended parties to get high and browse the drunken female crowd for a one-night stand. If I’d gone off to get high with him, I would have been it. I wasn’t interested in a one-night stand, but it was nice to be considered. After all, since my sophomore year, no other guy at this school had showed an ounce of interest in me.\\n\\n “What’s your problem? You look like a four-year-old who lost her balloon.” Lila joined me as I walked down the hall.\\n\\n “I’m destined to die a virgin.” My own admission shocked me. Had those words left my mouth? I rubbed the smooth material of Noah’s jacket. Maybe I should have gone off with him. Not to get high, but to … well … not die a virgin.\\n\\n Lila laughed so loudly several people gawked as we walked past. I lowered my head, let my curls hide my face and willed everyone to look away. We reached our lockers and I opened mine with the hopes of crawling inside.\\n\\n “Hardly likely. But I thought you weren’t into hookups.” Lila rifled through her own locker, which was next to mine.\\n\\n “I’m not. I held out with Luke because I wasn’t ready. I never imagined there would come a day when nobody would want me.”\\n\\n I stared down at my gloved hands, causing seasickness to hit me on dry land. When the bell rang, I’d have to take them off. This wasn’t about sex. “No guy’s going to get close enough to ever love me.”\\n\\n Lila closed her locker and bit her lip. “Your mom sucks.”\\n\\n I inhaled deeply to keep from falling apart. “Yeah. I know.”\\n\\n Her eyes narrowed on the jacket I still clutched. “What’s that?”\\n\\n “Noah Hutchins’s jacket,” Natalie said, appearing out of nowhere and snatching it out of my hand. Her brown hair swung from side to side. “Follow me! Now!”\\n\\n Lila’s eyes widened to the size of cantaloupes as we trailed Natalie into the restroom. “Why do you have Noah Hutchins’s jacket?”\\n\\n I opened my mouth to answer, but Grace slammed the door to the bathroom shut. “We don’t have time for small talk. He’s coming.”\\n\\n Natalie used one finger to push each stall door open to confirm we were alone. The place smelled of disinfectant and a sink dripped every couple of seconds.\\n\\n “Stop it,” said Grace. “I already checked.”\\n\\n Lila grabbed Grace’s hand. “Whoa. I need answers. Who’s coming? Why does Echo have Noah’s jacket and where did you get that sweater?”\\n\\n “Luke. For Echo. You were so drunk at the party that you messed with the buddy system and now Echo has Noah’s jacket. She can’t be seen with it.” Grace jerked it out of Natalie’s hand. “We are getting Echo’s life back.”\\n\\n I pried the jacket from Grace’s fingers. My friends had officially lost their minds. “It’s a jacket, not crack. He’s in my first period class. I’ll give it to him then. And who cares that Luke is looking for me?”\\n\\n Grace pointed a red fingernail at me. “You held out. Luke asked you to dance at the party and instead of dancing with him we had to take Lila home. Now he’s looking for you to find out why you stood him up. This is the answer to all of our prayers.”\\n\\n I clutched the jacket closer. “What? I mean, so? Luke and I are friends.” I guessed. He’d wished me a happy birthday. Friends do that.\\n\\n Lila started her annoying bouncing dance. “So? Dancing with you at a party is way past friendship. It means he’s into you again.”\\n\\n “Exactly,” said Grace. “If Luke’s into you then everyone else will be into you, too.”\\n\\n Lila waved her hands in the air. “More importantly, you are not going to die a virgin.” She sucked in a dramatic breath. “Luke cannot see you with another guy’s jacket. Grace, take the jacket to your locker and we’ll figure out a plan later.”\\n\\n Grace raised an eyebrow. “No way. I’m sure that thing reeks of drugs. What if they bring drug-sniffing dogs to school?”\\n\\n “Oh, my God, you are worthless,” Lila said.\\n\\n Tossing some of my curls over my shoulder, Grace straightened my shirt. “Go on, get out there before he misses you and heads to class.”\\n\\n Lila and Natalie pulled me out the door and I clutched Noah’s jacket closer to me. “You guys are way overanalyzing this,” I said as Lila speed dialed the combination to my locker.\\n\\n “He’s coming,” Natalie sang.\\n\\n Lila plucked the jacket from my hands, threw it in my locker, pushed me out of the way and slammed it shut. She and Natalie leaned against my locker, adding a second layer of security.\\n\\n “Hey, Echo.”\\n\\n I turned and faced Luke. “Hey.” So much had happened in the past three minutes, my mind became a tilt-a-whirl.\\n\\n Luke’s eyes flickered over Natalie and Lila. His eyebrows inched closer together. I remembered that look: he had something he wanted to say without an audience. But if Luke remembered nothing else about me, he’d recall I was a package deal.\\n\\n “I waited for you,” he said.\\n\\n “It’s my fault,” Lila blurted. “She didn’t have time to dance with you because I wanted to go home. I drank too much.”\\n\\n Both Luke and I stared at her and then at each other. One Mississippi of awkward silence. Two Mississippi of awkward silence. Three Mississippi of awkward silence.\\n\\n “Can I walk you to class, Echo?” he finally asked.\\n\\n “Sure.” I glanced at Lila and Natalie over my shoulder as I accompanied Luke down the hallway. Both flashed quick thumbs-ups. I sucked in a deep breath and smiled when I noticed Luke grinning at me. Wow—normal. Maybe it really was possible.\\n\\n That is, if normal meant hiding Noah Hutchins’s jacket in my locker … and pretending that I wasn’t thinking about how close he’d come to kissing me.\\n\\n NOAH\\n\\n “Hold this.” Mrs. Collins shoved a steaming to-go cup at me and went back to war with the school’s locked doors. We could barely see in the pale morning light, making it hard for her to find the right key on the overloaded chain. I considered giving her crap about her lack of organizational skills, but decided not to. It took some major balls to be alone with a punk like me.\\n\\n The warmth of the coffee reminded me how cold it was outside. Goose bumps pricked my exposed arms. I owned one long-sleeved shirt and only wore that for my brothers. Being jacket-less sucked.\\n\\n Her eyes settled on the tattoo on my biceps and her forever smile fell a centimeter. “Where’s your jacket, Noah? It’s cold.”\\n\\n “I gave it to someone.”\\n\\n A relieved sigh escaped her mouth when the third key she tried unlocked the door. She waved for me to go in. Instead, I held the door and nodded for her to go first. It would be my luck that a security guard would see me, shoot, then ask questions.\\n\\n Our footsteps echoed down the empty hallway. Thanks to our school’s new green policy, the lights flashed on as we approached. It put me on edge. On top of the system that stalked my every movement, now the building did, too.\\n\\n “Who did you give your jacket to?” Mrs. Collins entered the main office and unlocked her office door on the first try. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/pushing-the-limits-pushing-the-limits-1/page-8.html","bookId":2752,"book":{"id":2752,"title":"Pushing the Limits (Pushing the Limits #1)","description":"Storyline: Pushing the Limits (Pushing the Limits #1) \\n So wrong for each other …and yet so right. \\n No one knows what happened the night Echo Emerson went from popular girl with jock boyfriend to gossiped-about outsider with \"freaky\" scars on her arms.
