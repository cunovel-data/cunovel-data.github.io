{"id":91728,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"The imp stepped out of the flames, looked down to the aged, dying man, laboring for breath, showing pain with every movement Druzil heard the man\u0027s arm bone simply snap with age as he reached up for the air, heard a groan mixed in with the futile gasps.\\n\\n The imp only laughed and looked away. Druzil had overheard part of Aballister\u0027s conversation with the spirit of Bogo Rath, and though that conversation had been cryptic, the imp now suspected that this horrid creature might hold a particular grudge against Cadderly. Certainly the monster seemed to be moving with purpose; it hadn\u0027t even taken the time or effort to pursue tine fleeing men.\\n\\n Druzil willed himself into a state of invisibility and flapped his leathery bat wings, rising up in pursuit of the ghost, thinking that perhaps he had been wrong to doubt Aballister\u0027s promises that this would be an enjoyable mission.\\n\\n A Taste of Whafs to Come\\n\\n Aballister walked through a large room filled with cages, admiring his private menagerie of exotic monsters. \"Dorigen has spotted the young priest and his friends,\" the wizard said quietly, coming to a stop between two of the largest cages, each occupied by strange-looking beasts that seemed a mixture of two or more normal animals.\\n\\n \"Are you hungry?\" Aballister asked one winged leonine monstrosity, its tail covered with a multitude of iron-hard spikes. The creature roared in reply and butted its massive, powerful chest against the bars of its cage.\\n\\n Then fly,\" the wizard cooed, opening the cage door and running his skinny hands through the monster\u0027s thick mane as it ambled past. \"Dorigen will guide you to my wicked son. Do teach him a lesson.\" The old wizard cackled heartily. He had spent many private hours in this extra-dimensional region. He had actually created the place while studying in the Edificant Library. Aballister\u0027s biggest\\n\\n concerns at that time were the hovering priests always looking over his shoulder, making sure that his work was in accord with their strict rules. Little did they know that Aballister had circumvented then-watchful gazes, had created this extra pocket of real space so that he could continue his most precious, if most dangerous, experiments.\\n\\n That had been more than two decades before when Cad-derly was a babe, and when, the wizard mused, the leonine monster and the three-headed beast behind it were also babes.\\n\\n Aballister laughed aloud at the thought: he was sending two of his children out to kill the third.\\n\\n The two powerful beasts followed Aballister out of the room and out of another door in the extradimensional mansion that led to the rocky ridge above Castle Trinity, where Dorigen, her crystal ball in hand, waited.\\n\\n \"We are too high up,\" Vander protested as the party trudged along a narrow mountain trail more than halfway up a twelve-thousand foot peak. A few scraggly branches, bare of leaves, dotted the trail, but mostly the place was wind-carved rock, ridged in some places, polished smooth hi others. In this place, winter had already come in full. The snow lay deep, and the wind\u0027s bite, despite Cadderl/s magical protection spells, forced the companions to continually rub their hands to keep their fingers from growing numb. The narrow trail was mostly bare to the stone, at least, perpetually windblown so that little snow had found a hold there.\\n\\n \"We must stay far from the lower trails,\" Cadderly replied, having to yell to be heard through the growling wind. \"Many goblins and giantkin are about, fleeing Shilmista in search of their mountain holes.\"\\n\\n \"Better to face them than what we might find up here,\" Vander argued. The booming voice of the twelve-foot-tall giant, thick red beard crusted by blowing ice, had no trouble cutting through the din of the wind. \"You do not know the creatures of the lands where the snow does not melt, young priest\" The rugged firbolg was talking from some experience, it seemed, and the dwarves, Shayleigh, and Danica looked to Cadderly, hopeful that Vender\u0027s warning might carry some influence.\\n\\n \"Yeah, like that big bird I spotted, floating on the winds a mile away,\" Ivan put in.\\n\\n \"It was an eagle,\" Cadderly insisted, though only Ivan had actually seen the soaring creature. \"Some of the eagles in the Snowflakes are quite large, and I doubt...\"\\n\\n \"A mile away?\" Ivan balked,\\n\\n \"I doubt that it was a mile,\" Cadderly finished, to which Ivan only shook his yellow-haired head, adjusted his helmet, which sported a pair of deer antlers, and cast a less-than-friendly glare Cadderly*s way.\\n\\n By that time, Cadderly had found a new person to argue with, as Danica came up behind him and put a hand on his shoulder. He looked at her grim expression and recognized at once that she was in agreement with the others.\\n\\n \"I fear no monsters,\" she explained defensively, for she alone understood the pains the young priest had endured to get this quest underway. \"But the land here is treacherous, and the wind uncomfortable at best. A slip on the ice could send one of us tumbling down the mountainside.\" Danica looked up the slope to their right and continued ominously, \"And the snow hangs thick above us.\"\\n\\n Cadderly did not have to follow her upward gaze to understand that she was referring to the very real threat of an avalanche. They had passed the remnants of a dozen such disasters, though most were old, probably from last year\u0027s spring melt\\n\\n Cadderly took a deep breath and reminded himself of his secret purpose in being up this high, and he remained adamant The snow here is seasonal,\" he replied, celling ahead to Vander. \"Except for the very tops of the mountains, where we shall not go.\"\\n\\n Vander started to protest - Cadderly expected that the firbolg would argue that these fearful snow creatures might easily come down from the mountaintops when the snow lay so deep. He had barely uttered the first syllable of protest, though, when Cadderly interrupted him with a telepathic message, a magical plea that the firbolg lead on without further argument, that standing and talking only delayed the time when they could go back down to more hospitable climes.\\n\\n Vander grunted and turned about, flipping his white bearskin cloak back over one shoulder to reveal to the others that his huge hand rested uneasily on the sculpted hilt of his giant-sized sword.\\n\\n \"As for the wind and the ice,\" Cadderly said to Danica, \"we shall be careful with our steps and hold fast to our resolve.\"\\n\\n \"Unless we get plucked off by a passing bird,\" Ivan said dryly.\\n\\n \"It was only an eagle,\" Cadderly insisted again, turning on the dwarf, his anger flaring. Ivan shrugged and walked away. Pikel, seemingly oblivious to all the arguing and quite willing to go wherever the others led him, bobbed happily at his brother\u0027s side.\\n\\n \"Ye ever seen an eagle with four paws?\" Ivan snarled over his shoulder when he and Pikel had moved away.\\n\\n Pikel considered the question for a long moment before he stopped in his tracks, his smile melting away, and let out a profound, \"Oooo.\"\\n\\n Then the green-bearded dwarf skittered quickly to keep pace with the stomping Ivan. Together they walked right behind the firbolg and moved to Vander\u0027s sides when the trail was wide enough to accommodate them. The firbolg and the dwarves had become fast friends over the last days, continually trading tales of their respective homelands, places somewhat similar in rugged terrain and wicked beasts.\\n\\n Cadderly came next in the procession, alone with his thoughts, still trying to reconcile his magical attack on Tho-bicus and contemplating the trials he knew that he would soon face, both at Castle Trinity and after Castle Trinity.\\n\\n Danica allowed Cadderly to get some distance away before she resumed the march, her eyes revealing a mixture of contempt and pain at the way Cadderly had just rebuked her.\\n\\n \"He is scared,\" Shayleigh said to Danica, coming to her side.\\n\\n \"And stubborn,\" Danica added.\\n\\n The elf maiden\u0027s sincere smile was too infectious for Danica to hold her grim thoughts. Danica was glad that Shayleigh was beside her once more, feeling an almost sisterly bond with the spirited elf. Given Cadderly* s recent mood and recent secretive actions, Danica felt as though she desperately needed a sister.\\n\\n For Shayleigh, the trip was both a debt repaid and an act of sincere friendship. Cadderly, Danica, and the dwarves had come to the fighting aid of Shilmista\u0027s elves, and during their time together, Shayleigh had come to like all of them. More than one of Shilmista\u0027s haughty elves had joked at Shayleigh\u0027s expense, at the thought that an elf could so befriend a dwarf, but Shayleigh took it all in without complaint\\n\\n Less than a half hour later, on an exposed section of trail where the mountain to their right sloped up at a gentle angle, though the drop to their left remained steep, Vander pulied up short and put his great hands out to the sides to halt the dwarves. It had begun to snow again, the wind whipping the icy flakes so that the companions all had to keep their traveling cloaks tight about their faces. In that poor visibility, Vander was unsure about the unusual shape he noticed on a wide section of trail up ahead.\\n\\n The giant took a tentative step forward, drawing his massive sword halfway from its sheath. Ivan and Pikel leaned backward and looked to each other from behind the firbolg.\\n\\n With simultaneous nods, they clutched then weapons, though they had no idea of what had put Vander on the alert\\n\\n Then Vander relaxed visibly, and the dwarves shared another shrug and tucked their hands back under their thick cloaks.\\n\\n Two steps later, the shape, which Vander had identified as a snowbank, coiled up like some huge serpent and lashed out at the giant, brushing against his outstretched fingers.\\n\\n Vander cried out and leaped back, grabbing at his suddenly bloody hand.\\n\\n \"The damn snow bit him!\" Ivan yelled and rushed up, chopping with his double-headed axe. The blade passed right through the weird monster, clanging against the bare stone underneath, cutting nearly a quarter of the creature\u0027s bulk away.\\n\\n But that quarter was just as alive, and just as vicious, as the main bulk, and now there were two monsters to fight\\n\\n Vander rushed in, chopping his sword with his one good hand.\\n\\n Then there were three monsters.\\n\\n Ivan felt an agonizing burn along one arm, but, blinded by the whipping wind and the battle frenzy, the dwarf did not realize the results of his actions. He brought his axe to bear repeatedly, unwittingly multiplying the monstrous ranks.\\n\\n Cadderly had only just noticed the frenzied movements when Shayleigh\u0027s cry from behind turned him about. The young priest\u0027s eyes widened considerably when he saw the truth of Ivan\u0027s \"eagle,\" a leonine beast taller than Cadderly and with a wingspan fully twenty-five feet across. The swooping creature did not come in close to Shayleigh and Danica, but instead abruptly broke the momentum of its dive, rearing in the air and whipping its tail over one muscled shoulder.\\n\\n A volley of iron spikes shot out at the two. Danica pushed Shayleigh to the side, then contorted her own body somehow, miraculously avoiding any serious hits, though a line of blood, stark red against the white background, appeared immediately along the side of one arm.\\n\\n Shayleigh was quick to ready her bow, but the leonine creature swooped away, and her shot was a long one, lost in the wind and the driving snow.\\n\\n Up ahead, Vander got hit again and shrieked as Cadderly would never have believed the stoic and proud giant ever could. The young priest stumbled forward to discern the cause of the fighting, squinting and shaking his head, for he could not believe that his friends were fully surrounded by some sort of animated snow!\\n\\n Their repeated blows had no effect - other than to create more monsters.\\n\\n Cadderly fell into the song of Deneir, the logic that guided the harmony of his universe. He saw the spheres, not just the celestial spheres, but the magical spheres of elemental and energy-based powers. The simple and evident truths led Cadderly quickly to the conclusion that snow would best be battled with fire, and, hardly thinking about the movement, the young priest lifted his fist toward the largest section of creature between himself and his friends and uttered \"Fete!\" the Elvish word for fire.\\n\\n A line of flames shot out from Cadderly\u0027s gold and onyx ring, engulfing several of the snow monsters in a sizzling blaze. Animated snow became insubstantial steam and gases, blowing away on the wind.\\n\\n Then something struck hard against Cadderly\u0027s back, hurling him to the ground. Fear told him that the leonine monster must be back and he swung about, his clenched fist out in front\\n\\n He saw Danica standing protectively behind him and realized that it was she who had struck him. She now faced the newest beast that had entered the fray, a beast that had apparently been intent on the distracted young priest.\\n\\n \"Chimera?\" Cadderly asked as much as stated when the winged, three-headed monster rushed in at Danica. Its central head and its torso were, like the other beast, those of a lion, but this one also had an orange scaled neck and head of a small dragon flanking it and a black goat\u0027s head behind.\\n\\n The creature reared in midair; the dragon\u0027s head breathed forth a line of flame.\\n\\n Danica jumped to the side away from Cadderly, then leaped up and caught a handhold on the stone above her, tucking her feet up high and somehow escaping the searing blast. She came back to the ledge after the fires had expired, but found no safe footing, for the flames had melted away the snow and weakened the integrity of that section of ledge. Ice reformed almost immediately in the freezing temperatures, and the young monk fell down hard onto her back. And then, dazed, Danica slipped out over the ledge.\\n\\n Cadderly\u0027s world seemed to stop.\\n\\n Farther down the trail, Shayleigh put her bow to deadly use, firing arrow after arrow at the leonine monster. Even with the powerful winds, many of her shots hit the mark, but the beast was resilient, and when its spike-throwing tail whipped about once more, Shayleigh had nowhere to run.\\n\\n She grimaced at the dull thuds as several missiles blasted her to a half-sitting, half-leaning position on the mountain slope. She felt the sudden warmth of her own lifeblood flowing from several wounds. Stubbornly, the elf maiden put another arrow to her bowstring and let fly, scoring a solid hit in the monster\u0027s thick-muscled chest\\n\\n Cadderly dove flat to the stone, reached out desperately for Danica, who had gained a tentative handhold several feet below the ledge. She couldn\u0027t possibly climb up the ice in the driving wind and snow, and Cadderly, for all his straining, couldn\u0027t reach her.\\n\\n The priest sang along with the song of Deneir, again seeking out an elemental sphere, this time searching for answers in the realm of air.\\n\\n Danica heard his singing and looked up plaintively, knowing that her one hand would not keep her in place for very long.\\n\\n Moments later, Cadderly ended the song, looked back at Danica, and commanded her in magically enhanced tones to jump up at him.\\n\\n She did, trusting in her lover. Their hands brushed, just for a moment, but in that instant Danica heard Cadderly utter an arcane rune, a triggering word to a spell, and she felt a tingle as some power passed between them.\\n\\n Then Danica plummeted away.\\n\\n Cadderly had no time to watch her descent, had to trust fully in the revealed truths of his god. He looked all about and was relieved to see that the strong wind was working for them, forcing the two winged monsters to take long runs to get near the ledge.\\n\\n Up ahead, Vander had used the break caused by Cad-derly\u0027s fire to get out of the encircling monsters, and had taken Ivan with him, holding the dwarf in midair with a hand that seemed almost skinless.\\n\\n Pikel had moved up a rock, but was again surrounded, beating the many vicious creatures back wildly with his tree-trunk club.\\n\\n Cadderly lifted his onyx ring, but saw no clear angle. He fell into the song instead, entering the realm of fire.\\n\\n \"Me brother!\" Ivan wailed, pulling free of Vander\u0027s grasp. The yellow-bearded dwarf expected Vander to rush in beside him, but when he glanced at the firbolg, he realized the awful truth. The snow creatures had hit Vander several times, on both hands and forearms and once, probably when the giant had stooped to hoist up Ivan, on the side of his face. In each of these places, Vander\u0027s skin had simply dissolved, leaving garish, brutal wounds.\\n\\n Now the firbolg was beyond comprehension, swaying from side to side as he barely managed to stand.\\n\\n \"Oo, ow!\" came a cry from ahead.\\n\\n Pikel needed help.\\n\\n Ivan took a running stride toward his brother, then fell back in absolute shock as a ring of flames erupted around Pikel and rolled down the rock.\\n\\n \"Me brother!\" Ivan cried again, above the sudden roar. He wanted to go forward, was willing, in spirit at least, to throw himself through the unexplained fiery curtain and die beside his dear brother. But the heat was too intense as the flames continued outward, the curtain fully twenty feet high. Steam mixed with the fires as snow and ice and the creatures were fully consumed.\\n\\n Above his despair, Ivan heard a cry of hope, heard Cadderly shout out for Pikel to \"Stand fast!\"\\n\\n A goat head butted Ivan hard on the shoulder, and a lion\u0027s paw swatted the dwarfs head, launching him backward. He cracked into Vander\u0027s knee, his deer-andered helmet tearing firbolg skin, and his momentum knocking the stunned giant\u0027s feet out from under him. Down came Vander, on top of Ivan.\\n\\n Blood had filled one of Shayleigh\u0027s clear violet eyes. She saw Cadderly, though, lying on the ledge, saw the chimera strike the dwarf, then swoop away, caught by the mighty wind.\\n\\n Cadderly drew out something small, fumbled with the heavy belt strapped diagonally across his chest, and began to sing. From the desperate look in the young priest\u0027s eyes, Shayleigh guessed that the leonine beast had returned.\\n\\n It was barely visible, perhaps thirty feet out from the ledge. Shayleigh could see that its target this time was Cadderly, and possibly the fallen dwarf and giant not far from Cadderly\u0027s flank.\\n\\n The monster darted in suddenly and reared, its deadly tail snapping forward.\\n\\n \"No!\" the elf maiden cried, readying her bow. Looking back fearfully to the trail, she noticed a slight shimmer appear in the air before the priest Shayleigh dismissed it as an optical trick of the snow and wind - until the mutant manticore\u0027s spikes entered that area and somehow reversed direction, shooting back out at the surprised beast!\\n\\n Gouts of blood exploded against the leonine chest, driving the beast backward in the air. Shayleigh looked back to see Cadderly poised, hand-crossbow steadied across his free wrist. She quickly put an arrow into the monster\u0027s flank, thinking that Cadderly\u0027s tiny crossbow would be of little use.\\n\\n The crossbow dart raced out at the monster. The lion roared - then roared louder as the quarrel stung its nose. For a moment, the bolt seemed a puny thing against the sheer bulk and strength of the beast, but then it collapsed on itself, crushing the vial of Oil of Impact. The resulting explosion sent bits of the monster\u0027s face and teeth scattering to the winds and drove the front end of the dart through the beast\u0027s thick skull\\n\\n Four paws flailing wildly, the dying monster dropped from sight\\n\\n Cadderly looked back to his ring of fire, confident that it had dispatched the snow creatures. All that remained was the chimera, floating somewhere out on the winds behind the blinding snow.\\n\\n \"Behind!\" Shayleigh cried suddenly, spinning about and firing two quick arrows. The swooping chimera shrieked; its dragon head came in line with Cadderly, ready to loose its fiery breath once more.\\n\\n Cadderly countered with a quick and simple magic, pulled from the element of water. A gusher erupted from his hands at the same time as the dragon head breathed, the fiery breath dissipating into a cloud of harmless steam.\\n\\n The chimera burst through the gray veil right above the young priest, foreclaws slashing at Cadderly and knocking him to the ground.\\n\\n \"Ye mixed up bag o* body parts!\" Ivan hooted, finally extracting himself from under the fallen giant Two running steps put the infuriated dwarf alongside the soaring monster, and he leaped up, grabbing a horn of the black goat\u0027s head and pulling himself astride the beast\\n\\n Shayleigh followed their swooping path, ready to let fly another arrow, but she pulled up suddenly, stunned.\\n\\n Danica had come back up to their level. She was walking in midair! \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-cleric-quintet-the-fallen-fortress-the-cleric-quintet-4/page-4.html","bookId":2110,"book":{"id":2110,"title":"The Cleric Quintet: The Fallen Fortress (The Cleric Quintet #4)","description":"Storyline: The war rages on.
