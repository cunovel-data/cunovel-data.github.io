{"id":91737,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"\"I fear that your son purposely misdirected my scrying attempt,\" Dorigen quickly added, putting the older wizard on the defensive.\n \"The last time Druzil saw Cadderly, he was near the mountain called Nightglow,\" Aballister said, and Dorigen nodded her agreement. There is a storm brewing in that area, so it is unlikely that he will have gone very far.\"\n That would seem logical,\" Dorigen agreed, though she knew better.\n The old wizard grinned evilly. \"A storm brewing,\" he mused. \"But unlike any storm my foolish son has ever encountered!\"\n Now it was Dorigen\u0027s turn to eye him suspiciously. \"What have you done?\"\n \"Done?\" Aballister laughed. \"Better to ask what I will do!\" Aballister spun about in a circle, as animated as Dorigen had seen him since this whole business had begun, nearly a year before when Barjin had entered the Edificant Library.\n \"I grow weary of the game!\" Aballister said suddenly, fiercely, stopping his spin so that his hollowed face was barely inches from Dorigen\u0027s crooked nose. \"And so now, I will end it!\"\n With a snap of his fingers, he left the room, left Dorigen to wonder what he had in mind. The curtain now serving as her door seemed a poignant reminder of AbalHster\u0027s wrath, and she couldn\u0027t contain a shudder when she thought of the magics that Aballister might soon be launching Cadderly\u0027s way.\n Or at where he believed Cadderly to be.\n Why hadn\u0027t she told her mentor the truth? Dorigen wondered. Aballister was planning something big, perhaps even going out personally to deal with his son, and Dorigen hadn\u0027t told him what she knew about Cadderly\u0027s position, that the young priest was many miles beyond Nightglow. Rationally, it seemed to the woman that letting Aballister go out and deal with Cadderly would be her safest course, for if Cadderly\u0027s attempt at Castle Trinity proved successful, Dorigen, no ally of the young priest, would likely find herself in serious trouble.\n Dorigen ran a finger along the length of her crooked nose, shook her long hair back from her face, and eyed the cloth covering the crystal ball. Cadderly might arrive in a day, and she had not told Aballister!\n Dorigen felt strangely removed from the cascading events about her, like some distant spectator. Cadderly could have killed her in Shilmista Forest, had her unconscious at his feet He had broken her hands and taken her magical items, putting her out of the fight\n But he had spared her life.\n Perhaps it was honor that guided Dorigen now, an unspo-^en agreement between her and the young priest A sense jf obligation told her to let it all play out, to stand asi they learned who was the stronger, the father or the son.\n Back in his private chambers, Aballister held a smoking beaker aloft in trembling hands. He focused his thoughts on Nightglow, the target area, and focused his magical energies on the contents of the beaker, an elixir of great strength.\n He uttered the enchanting words, spoke the arcane syllables from a nearly meditative state, losing himself in the swirling, growing energies. He continued for nearly an hour, until the vibrating power within the beaker threatened to blow apart and take Castle Trinity down with it\n The wizard hurled the beaker across the room, where it shattered at the base of the wall A gray puff of smoke arose above it, growling, rumbling.\n \"Mykos, mykos makom deignin,\" Aballister whispered. \"Go out, go out, my pet\"\n As though it had heard the wizard\u0027s request, the gray cloud filtered through a crack in the stone wall, worked its way through all the walls and out of Castle Trinity. It rose up high on the winds, sometimes following, sometimes moving of its own accord, and all the while the wizard\u0027s magical storm cloud began to grow and darken.\n Contained bursts of lightning rumbled as it soared across the mountains. Still the ominous thing thickened and darkened, and seemed as if it would explode with building energy.\n It raced across the high peaks of the Snowflakes, unerringly aimed for the region around Nightglow.\n Cadderly and his friends noticed the strange cloud, so much darker than the general overcast of the snowy day. Cadderly noticed, too, that while the more common clouds seemed to be drifting west to east, as was usual for the area\u0027s weather patterns, this strange cloud was racing almost due south.\n They heard the first rumble of thunder soon after, a tremendous, though distant blast that shook the ground under their feet\n \"Thunder?\" Ivan balked. \"Who ever heared o\u0027 thunder in the middle o\u0027 the damned winter?\"\n Cadderly bade Vander to lead them up higher, where they might see what was happening behind them. When they reached a higher plateau, affording them a view between several other peaks all the way back to Nightglow, the young priest wasn\u0027t so sure that he wanted to watch.\n Bolt after searing bolt of lightning, crystalline clear across the miles as the already dim daylight began to wane, slammed the mountainside, splintering rocks, splitting trees, and sizzling into the snow. Huge winds bent the pines on the mountain\u0027s lower slopes nearly horizontal and pelting ice quickly accumulated in the thick branches, bending the trees lower.\n \"We were wise in riding the dragon,\" Shayleigh remarked, quite overwhelmed, as were her companions, by the ferocity of the storm. Vander grunted, as though he had told them all, but in truth, even the firbolg, who had grown to adulthood in the harsh climate of the northern Spine of the World range, was at a loss to explain the sheer power of this distant storm.\n Another tremendous bolt slammed the mountainside, brightening the deepening gloom, its rumbling wake dislodging tons of snow into a cascading avalanche down Nightglow\u0027s northern face.\n \"Who ever heared of it?\" Ivan asked incredulously.\n The worst had not yet come. More lightning, more pelting ice assaulted the region about the mountain. Other avalanches soon began, tons and tons of snow plummeting down the mountainside to resettle far below. Then came the tornado, blacker than the impending night, a twister as wide, it seemed, as the foundation of the Edificant Libwry. It circled Nightglow, tearing trees, burrowing huge chasms in the high-piled snow.\n \"We must go,\" the firbolg reminded them all, for he - and, he correctly guessed, his friends - had seen more than enough. Shayleigh mentioned again that they were fortunate in riding out on the dragon, and Vander put in a word that winter storms so high up were unpredictably and ultimately deadly.\n Everyone readily agreed with the firbolg, but they all understood that what had happened back at Nightglow was more than a \"winter storm.\"\n Vander soon found them an uninhabited cave not too far from the valley of carnage, and truly, they were all glad to be sheltered from the suddenly frightening elements. The place was three-chambered, but snug, with a low ceiling and a lower doorway that blocked most of the wintry wind.\n Vander and the dwarves set up their bedrolls in the entry cavern, the largest of the chambers. Cadderly took the smallest chamber - to the left - as his own, with Danica and Shayleigh going to the right, the monk glancing back at Cadderly with concern every step of the way.\n Dusk came soon after, and then a quiet and star-filled night, so different from the storm. Soon the usual grumble-and-whistle snoring of Ivan and Pikel echoed throughout the chambers.\n Danica crept back into the entry cavern, saw Vender\u0027s huge form propped in the doorway. Though he had volunteered once more to take the watch, the firbolg was asleep, and Danica didn\u0027t blame him. It seemed safe enough to her, seemed as if all the world had taken a break from the chaos, and so she slipped through to Cadderly\u0027s chamber quietly, without disturbing the others.\n The young priest was sitting in the middle of the floor, hunched over a tiny candle. Deep in meditation, he did not hear Danica\u0027s approach.\n \"You should sleep,\" the monk offered, putting a hand gently on her lover\u0027s shoulder. Cadderly opened his sleepy eyes and nodded.\n He reached over his shoulder to grab Danica\u0027s hand, pulled her around to sit next to him, close to him.\n \"I have rested,\" he assured her. Danica had taught Cad-derly several rejuvenating meditation techniques, and she did not dispute the claim.\n \"The road has been more difficult than you expected,\" Danica said quietly, a trace of trepidation evident in her normally solid voice. \"And with perhaps the most difficult obstacle yet ahead of us.\"\n The young priest understood her reasoning. He, too, believed that the fury they had witnessed battering the slopes of Nightglow had been a calling card from Aballister. And he, too, was afraid. They had survived many brutal ordeals in the last year and over the last few days on the trail, but if that storm was any indication, their greatest trials were yet ahead of them, waiting for them in Castle Trinity. Since the manticore and chimera attack, Cadderly had known that Aballister was on to them, but he had not imagined the great strength of the wizard.\n An image of the landslide and the tornado assaulted his thoughts. Cadderly had enacted great magics of his own recently, but that display was far beyond his powers, he believed, far beyond his imagination!\n The young priest, trying to hold fast to his resolve, closed his eyes and sighed. \"I did not expect so many troubles,\" he admitted.\n \"Even a dragon,\" Danica remarked. \"I still cannot believe ...\" Her voice trailed off into an incredulous sigh.\n \"I knew that dealing with old Fyren would not be an easy task,\" Cadderly agreed.\n \"Did we have to go there?\" There remained no trace of anger in Danica\u0027s soft tones.\n Cadderly nodded. \"The world is a better place with the Ghearufu destroyed - and with Fyrentennimar destroyed, though I did not foresee that as a probability, even as a possibility. Of all that I have accomplished in my lifeline destruction of the Ghearufu might be the most important*\n A wistful smile crossed Danica\u0027s face as she caught the glimmer in Cadderly\u0027s barely open, but surely smiling, gray eyes.\n \"But not the most important of all you mean to do,\" the monk said coyly.\n Cadderly\u0027s eyes widened, and he regarded Danica with sincere admiration. How well she knew him! He had just been thinking of the many deeds that were sorting themselves out before him, of the many demands his special relationship with his god Deneir would make on him. Danica had seen it, had looked into his eyes, and had known exactly the tone of his thoughts, if not the specifics.\n \"I see a course before me,\" he admitted to her, his voice subdued, but firm with resolve. \"A dangerous and difficult course, I do not doubt\" Cadderly chuckled at the irony, and Danica looked at him quizzically, not understanding.\n \"Even after what we witnessed before setting our camp, I fear that the most difficult of my future obstacles will be the ones brought on by friends,\" he explained.\n Danica stiffened and shifted away.\n \"Not from you,\" Cadderly quickly assured her. \"I foresee changes at the Edificant Library, drastic changes that will not be met with approval from those who have the most to lose.\"\n \"Dean Thobicus?\"\n Cadderly nodded, his expression grim. \"And the headmasters,\" he added. The hierarchy has evolved away from the spirit of Deneir, has become something perpetuated by false traditions and piles of worthless paper.\" He chuckled again, but there was something sad in his voice. *Do you understand what I did to Thobicus for him to allow us to come out here?\" he asked.\n \"You tricked him,\" Danica replied.\n \"I dominated him,\" Cadderly corrected. \"I entered his mind and bent his will. I might well have killed him in the attempt, and the effects of the assault could remain with him for the rest of his years.\"\n An expression of confusion came over Danica, confusion fast turning to horror. \"Hypnosis?\"\n \"Far beyond hypnosis,\" Cadderly replied gravely. \"In hypnosis, I might have convinced Thobicus to change his thoughts.\" Cadderly looked away, seeming ashamed. \"I did not convince Thobicus. I evoked the change against his will, and then I entered his mind once more and modified his memory so that there would be no repercussions when ... if, we return to the library.\"\n Danica\u0027s almond eyes were wide with shock. She had known that Cadderly was uncomfortable with what he had done to Thobicus, but she had assumed that her love had exacted some charm spell over the dean. What Cadderly was talking about now, though the results had been similar to a charm, seemed somehow more sinister.\n \"I grabbed his will in my hand, and I crushed it,\" Cadderly admitted. \"I stole from him the very essence of his ego. If Thobicus recalls the incident, then his pride will never, ever recover from the shock.\"\n Then why did you do it?\" Danica demanded softly.\n \"Because my course was determined by powers greater than me,\" Cadderiy said. \"And greater than Thobicus.\"\n \"How many tyrants have made such a claim?\" Danica asked, trying hard not to sound sarcastic.\n Cadderly smiled helplessly and nodded, \"That is my fear.\n \"Yet I knew what I must do,\" he continued. \"The Ghearufu had to be destroyed - to study such a sentient, evil artifact would bring only disaster - and the war with Castle Trinity, if it comes to pass, will prove a travesty that cannot be tolerated, whatever side is victorious.\n \"I went after Thobicus in a way that left a foul taste in my mouth,\" Cadderly admitted. \"But I would do it again, and I may have to if my fears prove true.\" He quieted for a moment and considered the many wrongs he had witnessed, the many things within the Edificant Library that had long ago veered from the path of Deneir, searching for some solid example he might offer to Danica. \"If a young cleric in the library has an inspiration,\" he said at last, \"divine though he believes it to be, he cannot act upon it without first receiving the approval of the dean and the permission to take time away from meaningless duties.\"\n \"Thobicus must oversee...\" Danica began to argue, playing the pragmatic point of view.\n \"That process often takes as long as a year,\" Cadderly interrupted, no longer interested in hearing logical arguments for a course he knew in his heart to be wrong. Cadderly had heard those arguments from Headmaster Avery for all of his life, and they had fostered in him an indifference that swelled to so great a level that he had nearly deserted the order of Deneir. \"You have seen how Thobicus works,\" he said firmly. \"A wasted year will pass, and though the thoughts of the story the young cleric wished to pen, or the painting he wished to frame, might remain, the sense, the aura, that something divine might be guiding his hand will have long since flown.\"\n \"You speak from personal experience,\" Danica reasoned.\n \"Many times,\" Cadderly replied without hesitation. \"And I know that many of the things I have become comfortable with in my life, many of the things I now know I must change, I do not want to change, for I am afraid.\"\n He brought his finger up to Danica\u0027s lips to stem her forthcoming response. \"You are not among those things,\" he assured her, and then he grew very quiet, and all the world, even the dwarven snoring, seemed to hush in anticipation.\n \"I do believe that our relationship must change, though,\" Cadderly went on. \"What began in Carradoon must grow, or it must die.\"\n Danica grabbed his wrist and pulled his hand away from her face, eyeing him unblinkingly, not sure of what would come next from this surprising young man.\n \"Marry me,\" Cadderly said suddenly. \"Formally.\"\n Now Danica did blink, and she closed her eyes, hearing the echoes from those words a thousand times in the next second. She had waited so long for this moment, had longed for it and feared it all at the same time. For while she loved Cadderly with all her heart, being a wife in Faerun carried expectations of servitude. And Danica, proud and capable, served no one.\n \"You agree with the changes,\" Cadderly said. \"You agree with the course my life will take. I cannot do it alone, my love.\" He paused and nearly faltered. \"I do not want to do it alone! When I have completed what Deneir has asked, when I look upon the work, there will be no satisfaction unless you are there beside me.\"\n \"When I have completed?\" Danica echoed and asked, emphasizing Cadderly\u0027s use of the personal pronoun and trying to get some sense of what role Cadderly meant for her to play in it all\n Cadderly thought about the emphasis of her response and then nodded. \"I am a disciple of Deneir,\" he explained. \"Many of the battles he guides me to, I must fight alone. I think of it as you think of your studies. I know that, as each goal is attained, richer by far will be my satisfaction if...\"\n \"What of my studies?\" Danica interrupted.\n Cadderly was ready for the question and understood Danica\u0027s concern. \"When you broke the stone and achieved Gigel Nugel,\" he began, referring to an ancient test of achievement that Danica had recently completed, \"what were your thoughts?\"\n Danica remembered the incident, and a smile spread wide across her face. \"I felt your arm around me,\" she replied.\n Cadderly nodded and pulled her close, kissing her gently on the cheek. \"We have so much to show each other,\" he said.\n \"My studies might take me away,\" Danica said, pulling back.\n Cadderly laughed aloud. \"If they do, then you shall go,\" he said. \"But you will come back to me, or I will go to you. I have faith, Danica, that our chosen paths will nottake us apart I have faith in you, and in myself.\"\n The somber cloud seemed to fly from Danica\u0027s fair features. Her grin widened to a dimpled smile, and her brown eyes sparkled with the moisture of joyful tears. She pulled Cadderly back to her, kissing him hard and long.\n \"Cadderly,\" she said coyly, as her wistful, mischievous smile sent a stream of thoughts careening through him. A shiver rippled up his spine and then back down again as Danica added, \"We are alone.\"\n Much later that night, with the sleeping Danica cradled in his arms and the dwarven snoring continuing its relentless pace, Cadderly rested back against the wall and replayed the conversation.\n \"How many tyrants have made such a claim?\" he whispered to the empty darkness. His considered his course once more, thought of the profound impact his intended actions would have on all the region surrounding Impresk Lake. He believed in his heart that the changes would better everyone, that the library would once again take on the true course of Deneir. He believed that he was right, that his course was inspired by a trusted god. But how many tyrants had made such a claim?\n \"AH of them,\" Cadderly answered grimly after a long pause, and he hugged Danica close.\n Aballister rested back in his chair, exhausted from his magical assault He had thrown his full weight against Cadderly, had pounded the mountain region mercilessly. The wizard\u0027s smile held firm for a long while as he pondered what Cadderly, in the unlikely event that the boy was still alive, might be thinking now.\n Aballister felt a tug within his mind, a gentle prodding. It was Druzil, he knew, for he had expected the imp\u0027s call. The wizard\u0027s smile became an open laugh - what might the imp, who had been so close to Nightglow, think now of him? Anxious to know, he let the imp into his mind. Greetings, dear Druzil, Aballister said. Bene tellemara!\n Aballister cackled with glee. My dear, dear Druzil, he thought after a moment, what could be the trouble! \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-cleric-quintet-the-fallen-fortress-the-cleric-quintet-4/page-13.html","bookId":2110,"book":{"id":2110,"title":"The Cleric Quintet: The Fallen Fortress (The Cleric Quintet #4)","description":"Storyline: \n The war rages on.
