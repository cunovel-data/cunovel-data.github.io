Gazing over the side, we saw naught but a far-darting ray in its depths. Then Yoomy, before buried in a reverie, burst forth with a verse, sudden as a jet from a Geyser. Like the fish of the bright and twittering fin, Bright fish! diving deep as high soars the lark, So, far, far, far, doth the maiden swim, Wild song, wild light, in still ocean\u0027s dark. \"What maiden, minstrel?\" cried Media. \"None of these,\" answered Yoomy, pointing out a shallop gliding near. \"The damsels three:—Taji, they pursue you yet.\" That still canoe drew nigh, the Iris in its prow. Gliding slowly by, one damsel flung a Venus-car, the leaves yet fresh. Said Yoomy—\"Fly to love.\" The second maiden flung a pallid blossom, buried in hemlock leaves. Said Yoomy, starting—\"I have wrought a death.\" Then came showering Venus-cars, and glorious moss-roses numberless, and odorous handfuls of Verbena. Said Yoomy—\"Yet fly, oh fly to me: all rosy joys and sweets are mine.\" Then the damsels floated on. \"Was ever queen more enigmatical?\" cried Media—\"Love,—death,—joy, —fly to me? But what says Taji?\" \"That I turn not back for Hautia; whoe\u0027er she be, that wild witch I — contemn.\" \"Then spread our pinions wide! a breeze! up sails! ply paddles all! Come, Flora\u0027s flute, float forth a song.\" To pieces picking the thorny roses culled from Hautia\u0027s gifts, and holding up their blighted cores, thus plumed and turbaned Yoomy sang, leaning against the mast:— Oh! royal is the rose, But barbed with many a dart; Beware, beware the rose, \u0027Tis cankered at the heart. Sweet, sweet the sunny down, Oh! lily, lily, lily down! Sweet, sweet, Verbena\u0027s bloom! Oh! pleasant, gentle, musky bloom! Dread, dread the sunny down; Lo! lily-hooded asp; Blooms, blooms no more Verbena; White-withered in your clasp. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2768/76430.html","bookId":1334,"book":{"id":1334,"title":"Mardi: and A Voyage Thither","description":"简介： Not long ago, having published two narratives of voyages in the Pacific, which, in many quarters, were received with incredulity, the thought occurred to me, of indeed writing a romance of Polynesian adventure, and publishing it as such; to see wheth...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2768","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:51 AM"}}
