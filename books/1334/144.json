{"id":27607,"no":144,"title":"CHAPTER XXXVII. — Taji Still Hunted, And Beckoned","content":"Previous to the kings\u0027 flight, we had plunged into the neighboring woods; and from thence emerging, entered brakes of cane, sprouting from morasses. Soon we heard a whirring, as if three startled partridges had taken wing; it proved three feathered arrows, from three unseen hands. Gracing us, two buried in the ground, but from Taji\u0027s arm, the third drew blood. On all sides round we turned; but none were seen. \"Still the avengers follow,\" said Babbalanja. \"Lo! the damsels three!\" cried Yoomy. \"Look where they come!\" We joined them by the sumach-wood\u0027s red skirts; and there, they waved their cherry stalks, and heavy bloated cactus leaves, their crimson blossoms armed with nettles; and before us flung shining, yellow, tiger-flowers spotted red. \"Blood!\" cried Yoomy, starting, \"and leopards on your track!\" And now the syrens blew through long reeds, tasseled with their panicles, and waving verdant scarfs of vines, came dancing toward us, proffering clustering grapes. \"For all now yours, Taji; and all that yet may come,\" cried Yoomy, \"fly to me! I will dance away your gloom, and drown it in inebriation.\" \"Away! woe is its own wine. What may be mine, that will I endure, in its own essence to the quick. Let me feel the poniard if it stabs.\" They vanished in the wood; and hurrying on, we soon gained sun-light, and the open glade. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2768/76484.html","bookId":1334,"book":{"id":1334,"title":"Mardi: and A Voyage Thither","description":"简介： Not long ago, having published two narratives of voyages in the Pacific, which, in many quarters, were received with incredulity, the thought occurred to me, of indeed writing a romance of Polynesian adventure, and publishing it as such; to see wheth...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2768","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:51 AM"}}
