I am the mildest devil that ever entered man; in propria persona, no antlers do I wear; my tail has lost its barb, as at last your Mardian lions lose their caudal horns.\" \"A very sing-song devil this. But, prithee, who are you, sirrah?\" \"The mildest devil that ever entered man; in propria persona, no antlers do I wear; my tail has lost its barb, as at last your Mardian lions lose their caudal horns.\" \"A very iterating devil this. Sirrah! mock me not. Know you aught yet unrevealed by Babbalanja?\" \"Many things I know, not good to tell; whence they call me Azzageddi.\" \"A very confidential devil, this; that tells no secrets. Azzageddi, can I drive thee out?\" \"Only with this mortal\u0027s ghost:—together we came in, together we depart.\" \"A very terse, and ready devil, this. Whence come you, Azzageddi?\" \"Whither my catechist must go—a torrid clime, cut by a hot equator.\" \"A very keen, and witty devil, this. Azzageddi, whom have you there?\" \"A right down merry, jolly set, that at a roaring furnace sit and toast their hoofs for aye; so used to flames, they poke the fire with their horns, and light their tails for torches.\" \"A very funny devil, this. Azzageddi, is not Mardi a place far pleasanter, than that from whence you came?\" \"Ah, home! sweet, sweet, home! would, would that I were home again!\" \"A very sentimental devil, this. Azzageddi, would you had a hand, I\u0027d shake it.\" \"Not so with us; who, rear to rear, shake each other\u0027s tails, and courteously inquire, \u0027Pray, worthy sir, how now stands the great thermometer?\u0027\" \"The very prince of devils, this.\" \"How mad our Babbalanja is,\" cried Mohi. My lord, take heed; he\u0027ll bite.\" \"Alas! alas!\" sighed Yoomy. \"Hark ye, Babbalanja,\" cried Media, \"enough of this: doff your devil, and be a man.\" \"My lord, I can not doff him; but I\u0027ll down him for a time: Azzageddi! down, imp; down, down, down! so: now, my lord, I\u0027m only Babbalanja.\" \"Shall I test his sanity, my lord?\" cried Mohi. \"Do, old man.\" \"Philosopher, our great reef is surrounded by an ocean; what think you lies beyond?\" \"Alas!\" sighed Yoomy, \"the very subject to renew his madness.\" \"Peace, minstrel!\" said Media. \"Answer, Babbalanja.\" \"I will, my lord. Fear not, sweet Yoomy; you see how calm I am. Braid- Beard, those strangers, that came to Mondoldo prove isles afar, as a philosopher of old surmised, but was hooted at for his surmisings. Nor is it at all impossible, Braid-Beard, that beyond their land may exist other regions, of which those strangers know not; peopled with races something like us Mardians; but perhaps with more exalted faculties, and organs that we lack. They may have some better seeing sense than ours; perhaps, have fins or wings for arms.\" \"This seems not like sanity,\" muttered Mohi. \"A most crazy hypothesis, truly,\" said Media. \"And are all inductions vain?\" cried Babbalanja. \"Have we mortals naught to rest on, but what we see with eyes? Is no faith to be reposed in that inner microcosm, wherein we see the charted universe in little, as the whole horizon is mirrored in the iris of a gnat? Alas! alas! my lord, is there no blest Odonphi? no Astrazzi?\" \"His devil\u0027s uppermost again, my lord,\" cried Braid-Beard. \"He\u0027s stark, stark mad!\" sighed Yoomy. \"Ay, the moon\u0027s at full,\" said Media. \"Ho, paddlers! we depart.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2768/76476.html","bookId":1334,"book":{"id":1334,"title":"Mardi: and A Voyage Thither","description":"简介： Not long ago, having published two narratives of voyages in the Pacific, which, in many quarters, were received with incredulity, the thought occurred to me, of indeed writing a romance of Polynesian adventure, and publishing it as such; to see wheth...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2768","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:51 AM"}}
