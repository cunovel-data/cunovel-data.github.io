{"id":27655,"no":192,"title":"CHAPTER LXXXVI. — They Meet The Phantoms","content":"That starless midnight, there stole from out the darkness, the Iris flag of Hautia. Again the sirens came. They bore a large and stately urn-like flower, white as alabaster, and glowing, as if lit up within. From its calyx, flame-like, trembled forked and crimson stamens, burning with intensest odors. The phantoms nearer came; their flower, as an urn of burning niter. Then it changed, and glowed like Persian dawns; or passive, was shot over by palest lightnings;—so variable its tints. \"The night-blowing Cereus!\" said Yoomy, shuddering, \"that never blows in sun-light; that blows but once; and blows but for an hour.—For the last time I come; now, in your midnight of despair, and promise you this glory. Take heed! short time hast thou to pause; through me, perhaps, thy Yillah may be found.\" \"Away! away! tempt me not by that, enchantress! Hautia! I know thee not; I fear thee not; but instinct makes me hate thee. Away! my eyes are frozen shut; I will not be tempted more.\" \"How glorious it burns!\" cried Media. I reel with incense:—can such sweets be evil?\" \"Look! look!\" cried Yoomy, \"its petals wane, and creep; one moment more, and the night-flower shuts up forever the last, last hope of Yillah!\" \"Yillah! Yillah! Yillah!\" bayed three vengeful voices far behind. \"Yillah! Yillah!—dash the urn! I follow, Hautia! though thy lure be death.\" The Cereus closed; and in a mist the siren prow went on before; we, following. When day dawned, three radiant pilot-fish swam in advance: three ravenous sharks astern. And, full before us, rose the isle of Hautia. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2768/76532.html","bookId":1334,"book":{"id":1334,"title":"Mardi: and A Voyage Thither","description":"简介： Not long ago, having published two narratives of voyages in the Pacific, which, in many quarters, were received with incredulity, the thought occurred to me, of indeed writing a romance of Polynesian adventure, and publishing it as such; to see wheth...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2768","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:51 AM"}}
