Said Yoomy, \"A cruel message!\" With the right hand, the second syren presented glossy, green wax- myrtle berries, those that burn like tapers; the third, a lily of the valley, crushed in its own broad leaf. This done, they earnestly eyed Yoomy; who, after much pondering, said—\"I speak for Hautia; who by these berries says, I will enlighten you.\" \"Oh, give me then that light! say, where is Yillah?\" and I rushed upon the heralds. But eluding me, they looked reproachfully at Yoomy; and seemed offended. \"Then, I am wrong,\" said Yoomy. \"It is thus:—Taji, you have been enlightened, but the lily you seek is crushed.\" Then fell my heart, and the phantoms nodded; flinging upon me bilberries, like rose pearls, which bruised against my skin, left stains. Waving oleanders, they retreated. \"Harm! treachery! beware!\" cried Yoomy. Then they glided through the wood: one showering dead leaves along the path I trod, the others gayly waving bunches of spring-crocuses, yellow, white, and purple; and thus they vanished. Said Yoomy, \"Sad your path, but merry Hautia\u0027s.\" \"Then merry may she be, whoe\u0027er she is; and though woe be mine, I — turn not from that to Hautia; nor ever will I woo her, though she woo me till I die;—though Yillah never bless my eyes.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2768/76443.html","bookId":1334,"book":{"id":1334,"title":"Mardi: and A Voyage Thither","description":"简介： Not long ago, having published two narratives of voyages in the Pacific, which, in many quarters, were received with incredulity, the thought occurred to me, of indeed writing a romance of Polynesian adventure, and publishing it as such; to see wheth...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2768","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:51 AM"}}
