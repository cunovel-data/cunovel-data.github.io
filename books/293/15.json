{"id":20812,"no":15,"title":"Chapter 15","content":"THERE WAS A DEAL OF CURSING and groaning as the men at the bottom of the ladder crawled to their feet. \n \n \u0027Somebody strike a light; my thumb\u0027s out of joint,\u0027 said one of the men, Parsons, a swarthy, saturnine man, steerer in Standish\u0027s boat, in which Harrison was puller. \n \n \u0027You\u0027ll find it knockin\u0027 about by the bitts,\u0027 Leach said, sitting down on the edge of the bunk in which I was concealed. \n \n There was a fumbling and a scratching of matches, and the sea-lamp flared up, dim and smoky, and in its weird light bare-legged men moved about, nursing their bruises and caring for their hurts. Oofty-Oofty laid hold of Parsons\u0027 thumb, pulling it out stoutly and snapping it back into place. I noticed at the same time that the Kanaka\u0027s knuckles were laid open clear across and to the bone. Exposing his beautiful white teeth in a grin, he explained that the wounds had come from striking Wolf Larsen in the mouth. \n \n \u0027So it was you, was it, you black beggar?\u0027 belligerently demanded Kelly, an Irish-American and a longshoreman making his first trip, and puller for Kerfoot. \n \n As he made the demand he shoved his pugnacious face close to Oofty-oofty. The Kanaka leaped backward to his bunk, to return with a leap, flourishing a long knife. \n \n \u0027Aw, go lay down; you make me tired,\u0027 Leach interfered. He was evidently, for all of his youth and inexperience, cock of the forecastle. \u0027G\u0027wan, you Kelly. You leave Oofty alone. How in- did he know it was you in the dark?\u0027 \n \n Kelly subsided with some muttering, and the Kanaka flashed his white teeth in a grateful smile. He was a beautiful creature, almost feminine in the pleasing lines of his figure, and there was a softness and dreaminess in his large eyes which seemed to contradict his reputation for strife and action. \n \n \u0027How did he get away?\u0027 said Johnson. \n \n He was sitting on the side of his bunk, the whole pose of his figure indicating utter dejection and hopelessness. He was still breathing heavily from the exertion he had made. His shirt had been ripped entirely from him in the struggle. \n \n \u0027Because he is the devil, as I told you before,\u0027 was Leach\u0027s answer, and thereat he was on his feet and raging his disappointment with tears in his eyes. \n \n \u0027And not one of you to get a knife!\u0027 was his unceasing lament. \n \n But the rest had a lively fear of consequences, and gave no heed to him. \n \n \u0027How\u0027ll he know which was which?\u0027 Kelly asked, and as he went on he looked murderously about him- \u0027unless one of us peaches.\u0027 \n \n \u0027He\u0027ll know as soon as ever he claps eyes on us,\u0027 Parsons replied. \u0027One look at you\u0027d be enough.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Tell him the deck flopped up an\u0027 gouged yer teeth out iv yer jaw,\u0027 Louis grinned. He was the only man who was not out of his bunk, and he was jubilant in that he possessed no bruises to advertise that he had had a hand in the night\u0027s work. \u0027Just wait till he gets a glimpse iv yer mugs tomorrow- the gang iv ye,\u0027 he chuckled. \n \n \u0027We\u0027ll say we thought it was the mate,\u0027 said one. And another: \u0027I know what I\u0027ll say- that I heared a row, jumped out of my bunk, got a jolly good crack on the jaw for my pains, an\u0027 sailed in myself. Couldn\u0027t tell who or what it was in the dark an\u0027 just hit out.\u0027 \n \n \u0027An\u0027 \u0027t was me you hit, of course,\u0027 Kelly seconded, his face brightening. \n \n Leach and Johnson took no part in the discussion, and it was plain to see that their mates looked upon them as men for whom the worst was inevitable, who were beyond hope and already dead. Leach stood their fears and reproaches for some time. Then he broke out: \n \n \u0027You make me tired! A nice lot of gazabas you are! If you talked less with yer mouth an\u0027 did something with yer hands, he\u0027d \u0027a\u0027 be\u0027n done with by now. Why couldn\u0027t one of you, just one of you, get me a knife when I sung out? You make me sick! A-beefin\u0027 an\u0027 bellerin\u0027 round as though he\u0027d kill you when he gets you! You know he won\u0027t. Can\u0027t afford to. No shippin\u0027-masters or beachcombers over here, an\u0027 he wants yer in his business, an\u0027 he wants yer bad. Who\u0027s to pull or steer or sail ship if he loses yer? It\u0027s me an\u0027 Johnson have to face the music. Get into yer bunks, now, and shut yer faces; I want to get some sleep.\u0027 \n \n \u0027That\u0027s all right, all right,\u0027 Parsons spoke up. \u0027Mebbe he won\u0027t do for us, but mark my words, hell\u0027ll be an ice-box to this ship from now on.\u0027 \n \n All the while I had been apprehensive. What would happen to me when these men discovered my presence? I could never fight my way out as Wolf Larsen had done. And at this moment Latimer called down the scuttle: \n \n \u0027Hump, the Old Man wants you.\u0027 \n \n \u0027He ain\u0027t down here!\u0027 said Parsons. \n \n \u0027Yes, he is,\u0027 I said, sliding out of the bunk and striving my hardest to keep my voice steady and bold. \n \n The sailors looked at me in consternation. Fear was strong in their faces, and the devilishness which comes of fear. \n \n \u0027I\u0027m coming!\u0027 I shouted up to Latimer. \n \n \u0027No, you don\u0027t!\u0027 Kelly cried, stepping between me and the ladder, his right hand shaped into a veritable strangler\u0027s clutch. \u0027You sneak! I\u0027ll shut yer mouth!\u0027 \n \n \u0027Let him go!\u0027 Leach commanded. \n \n \u0027Not on yer life!\u0027 was the angry retort. \n \n Leach never changed his position on the edge of the bunk. \u0027Let him go, I say,\u0027 he repeated, but this time his voice was gritty and metallic. \n \n The Irishman wavered. I made to step by him, and he stood aside. When I had gained the ladder I turned to the circle of brutal and malignant faces peering at me through the semi-darkness. A sudden and deep sympathy welled up in me. \n \n \u0027I have seen and heard nothing, believe me,\u0027 I said quietly. \n \n \u0027I tell yer, he\u0027s all right,\u0027 I could hear Leach say as I went up. \u0027He don\u0027t like the Old Man no more nor you or me.\u0027 \n \n I found Wolf Larsen in the cabin, stripped and bloody, waiting for me. He greeted me with his whimsical smile. \n \n \u0027Come, get to work, doctor. The signs are favorable for an extensive practice this voyage. I don\u0027t know what the Ghost would have been without you, and if I could cherish such noble sentiments, I\u0027d tell you that her master is deeply grateful.\u0027 \n \n I knew the run of the simple medicine-chest the Ghost carried, and while I was heating water on the cabin stove and getting the things ready for dressing his wounds, he moved about, laughing and chatting, and examining his hurts with a calculating eye. I had never before seen him stripped, and the sight of his body quite took my breath away. \n \n I must say that I was fascinated by the perfect lines of Wolf Larsen\u0027s figure, and by what I may term the terrible beauty of it. I had noted the men in the forecastle. Powerfully muscled though some of them were, Oofty-Oofty had been the only one whose lines were at all pleasing, while, in so far as they pleased, had they been what I should call feminine. \n \n But Wolf Larsen was the man type, the masculine, and almost a god in his perfectness. As he moved about or raised his arms, the great muscles leapt and moved under the satiny skin. I have forgotten to say that the bronze ended with his face. His body, thanks to his Scandinavian stock, was fair as the fairest woman\u0027s. I remember his putting his hand up to feel of the wound on his head, and my watching the biceps move like a living thing under its white sheath. \n \n He noticed me, and I became aware that I was staring at him. \n \n \u0027God made you well,\u0027 I said. \n \n \u0027Did he?\u0027 he answered. \u0027I have often thought so myself, and wondered why.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Purpose-\u0027 I began. \n \n \u0027Utility,\u0027 he interrupted. \u0027This body was made for use. These muscles were made to grip and tear and destroy living things that get between me and life. Feel them,\u0027 he commanded. \n \n They were as hard as iron. And I observed, also, that his whole body had unconsciously drawn itself together, tense and alert; that muscles were softly crawling and shaping about the hips, along the back, and across the shoulders; that the arms were slightly lifted, their muscles contracting, the fingers crooking till the hands were like talons; and that even the eyes had changed expression and into them were coming watchfulness and measurement and a light none other than of battle. \n \n \u0027Stability, equilibrium,\u0027 he said, relaxing on the instant and sinking his body back into repose. \u0027Feet with which to clutch the ground, legs to stand on and to help withstand, while with arms and hands, teeth and nails, I struggle to kill and not to be killed. Purpose? Utility is the word.\u0027 \n \n I did not argue. I had seen the mechanism of the primitive fighting beast, and I was as strongly impressed as if I had seen the engines of a battleship or Atlantic liner. \n \n I was surprised, considering the fierce struggle in the forecastle, at the superficiality of his hurts, and I pride myself that I dressed them dexterously. With the exception of two bad wounds, the rest were merely severe bruises and lacerations. The blow which he had received before going overboard had laid his scalp open several inches. This, under his direction, I cleansed and sewed together. \n \n \u0027By the way, Hump, as I have remarked, you are a handy man,\u0027 Wolf Larsen began when my work was done. \u0027As you know, we\u0027re short a mate. Hereafter you shall stand watches, receive seventy-five dollars per month, and be addressed fore and aft as Mr. Van Weyden.\u0027 \n \n \u0027I- I don\u0027t understand navigation, you know,\u0027 I gasped. \n \n \u0027Not necessary at all.\u0027 \n \n \u0027I really do not care to sit in the high places,\u0027 I objected. \u0027I find life precarious enough in my present humble situation. I have no experience. Mediocrity, you see, has its compensations.\u0027 \n \n He smiled as though it were all settled. \n \n \u0027I won\u0027t be mate on this hell-ship!\u0027 I cried defiantly. \n \n I saw his face grow hard and the merciless glitter come into his eyes. He walked to the door of his room, saying: \n \n \u0027And now, Mr. Van Weyden, good night.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Good night, Mr. Larsen,\u0027 I answered weakly. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/94/4926.html","bookId":293,"book":{"id":293,"title":"The Sea-Wolf海狼","description":"简介： The Sea-Wolf is a 1904 psychological adventure novel by American novelist Jack London about a literary critic and other survivors of an ocean collision who come under the dominance of Wolf Larsen, the powerful and amoral sea captain who rescues ...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1289609238bf31c.jpg","type":"Inspirational","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/94","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:30 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:30 AM"}}
