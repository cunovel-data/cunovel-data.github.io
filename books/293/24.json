{"id":20821,"no":24,"title":"Chapter 24","content":"AMONG THE MOST VIVID memories of my life are those of the events on the Ghost which occurred during the forty hours succeeding the discovery of my love for Maud Brewster. I, who had lived my life in quiet places, only to enter at the age of thirty-five upon a court of the most irrational adventure I could have imagined, never had more incident and excitement crammed into any forty hours of my experience. Nor can I quite close my ears to a small voice of pride which tells me I did not do so badly, all things considered. \n \n To begin with, at the midday dinner Wolf Larsen informed the hunters that they were to eat thenceforth in the steerage. It was an unprecedented thing on sealing-schooners, where it is the custom for the hunters to rank unofficially as officers. He gave no reason, but his motive was obvious enough. Horner and Smoke had been displaying a gallantry toward Maud Brewster, ludicrous in itself and inoffensive to her, but to him evidently distasteful. \n \n The announcement was received with black silence, though the other four hunters glanced significantly at the two who had been the cause of their banishment. Jock Horner, quiet as was his way, gave no sign; but the blood surged darkly across Smoke\u0027s forehead, and he half opened his mouth to speak. Wolf Larsen was watching him, waiting for him, the steely glitter in his eyes; but Smoke closed his mouth again without having said anything. \n \n \u0027Anything to say?\u0027 the other demanded aggressively. \n \n It was a challenge, but Smoke refused to accept it. \n \n \u0027About what?\u0027 he asked so innocently that Wolf Larsen was disconcerted, while the others smiled. \n \n \u0027Oh, nothing,\u0027 Wolf Larsen said lamely. \u0027I just thought you might want to register a kick.\u0027 \n \n \u0027About what?\u0027 asked the imperturbable Smoke. \n \n Smoke\u0027s mates were now smiling broadly. His captain could have killed him, and I doubt not that blood would have flowed had not Maud Brewster been present. For that matter, it was her presence which enabled Smoke to act as he did. He was too discreet and cautious a man to incur Wolf Larsen\u0027s anger at a time when that anger could be expressed in terms stronger than words. I was in fear that a struggle might take place, but a cry from the helmsman made it easy for the situation to save itself. \n \n \u0027Smoke ho!\u0027 the cry came down the open companionway. \n \n \u0027How\u0027s it bear?\u0027 Wolf Larsen called up. \n \n \u0027Dead astern, sir!\u0027 \n \n \u0027Maybe it\u0027s a Russian,\u0027 suggested Latimer. \n \n His words brought anxiety into the faces of the other hunters. A Russian could mean but one thing- a cruiser. The hunters, never more than roughly aware of the position of the ship, nevertheless knew that we were close to the boundaries of the forbidden sea, while Wolf Larsen\u0027s record as a poacher was notorious. All eyes centered upon him. \n \n \u0027We\u0027re dead safe,\u0027 he assured them with a laugh. \u0027No salt-mines this time, Smoke. But I\u0027ll tell you what- I\u0027ll lay odds of five to one it\u0027s the Macedonia.\u0027 \n \n No one accepted his offer, and he went on: \u0027In which event I\u0027ll lay ten to one there\u0027s trouble breezing up.\u0027 \n \n \u0027No, thank you,\u0027 Latimer spoke up. \u0027I don\u0027t object to losing my money, but I like to get a run for it, anyway. There never was a time when there wasn\u0027t trouble when you and that brother of yours got together, and I\u0027ll lay twenty to one on that.\u0027 \n \n A general smile followed, in which Wolf Larsen joined, and the dinner went on smoothly, thanks to me, for he treated me abominably the rest of the meal, sneering at me and patronizing me till I was all a-tremble with suppressed rage. Yet I knew I must control myself for Maud Brewster\u0027s sake, and I received my reward when her eyes caught mine for a fleeting second, and they said as distinctly as if she spoke, \u0027Be brave, be brave!\u0027 \n \n We left the table to go on deck, for a steamer was a welcome break in the monotony of the sea on which we floated, while the conviction that it was \u0027Death\u0027 Larsen and the Macedonia added to the excitement. The stiff breeze and heavy sea which had sprung up the previous afternoon had been moderating all the morning, so that it was now possible to lower the boats for an afternoon\u0027s hunt. The hunting promised to be profitable. We had sailed since daylight across a sea barren of seals and were now running into the herd. \n \n The smoke was still miles astern, but overhauling us rapidly, when we lowered our boats. They spread out and struck a northerly course across the ocean. Now and again we saw a sail lower, heard the reports of the shotguns, and saw the sail go up again. The seals were thick, the wind dying away; everything favored a big catch. As we ran off to get our leeward position of the last lee boat, we found the ocean fairly carpeted with sleeping seals. They were all about us, thicker than I had ever seen them before, in twos and threes and bunches, stretched full-length on the surface, and sleeping for all the world like so many lazy young dogs. \n \n Under the approaching smoke the hull and upper works of a steamer were growing larger and larger. It was the Macedonia. I read her name through the glasses as she passed by scarcely a mile to starboard. Wolf Larsen looked savagely at the vessel, while Maud Brewster was curious. \n \n \u0027Where is the trouble you were so sure was breezing up, Captain Larsen?\u0027 she asked gaily. \n \n He glanced at her, a moment\u0027s amusement softening his features. \n \n \u0027What did you expect? That they\u0027d come aboard and cut out throats?\u0027 \n \n \u0027Something like that,\u0027 she confessed. \u0027You understand, seal-hunters are so new and strange to me that I am quite ready to expect anything.\u0027 \n \n He nodded his head. \n \n \u0027Quite right, quite right. Your error is that you failed to expect the worst.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Why, what can be worse than cutting our throats?\u0027 she asked, with pretty, naive surprise. \n \n \u0027Cutting our purses,\u0027 he answered. \u0027Man is so made these days that his capacity for living is determined by the money he possesses.\u0027 \n \n \u0027\"Who steals my purse steals trash,\"\u0027 she quoted. \n \n \u0027Who steals my purse steals my right to live,\u0027 was the reply, \u0027old saws to the contrary. For he steals my bread and meat and bed, and in so doing imperils my life. There are not enough soup-kitchens and bread-lines to go around, you know, and when men have nothing in their purses they usually die, and die miserably- unless they are able to fill their purses pretty speedily.\u0027 \n \n \u0027But I fail to see that this steamer has any designs on your purse.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Wait and you will see,\u0027 he answered grimly. \n \n We did not have long to wait. Having passed several miles beyond our line of boats, the Macedonia proceeded to lower her own. We knew she carried fourteen boats to our five (we were one-short through the desertion of Wainwright), and she began dropping them far to leeward of our last boat, continued dropping them athwart our course, and finished dropping them far to windward of our first weather boat. The hunting, for us, was spoiled. There were no seals behind us, and ahead of us the line of fourteen boats, like a huge broom, swept the herd before it. \n \n Our boats hunted across the two or three miles of water between them and the point where the Macedonia\u0027s had been dropped, and then headed for home. The wind had fallen to a whisper, the ocean was growing calmer and calmer, and this, coupled with the presence of the great herd, made a perfect hunting-day- one of the two or three days to be encountered in the whole of a lucky season. An angry lot of men, boat-pullers and steerers as well as hunters, swarmed over our side. Each man felt that he had been robbed, and the boats were hoisted in amid curses, which, if curses had power, would have settled Death Larsen for all eternity- \u0027Dead and damned for a dozen of eternities,\u0027 commented Louis, his eyes twinkling up at me as he rested from hauling taut the lashings of his boat. \n \n \u0027Listen to them, and find if it is hard to discover the most vital thing in their souls,\u0027 said Wolf Larsen. \u0027Faith, and love, and high ideals? The good, the beautiful, the true?\u0027 \n \n \u0027Their innate sense of right has been violated,\u0027 Maud Brewster said, joining the conversation. \n \n She was standing a dozen feet away, one hand resting on the main-shrouds and her body swaying gently to the slight roll of the ship. She had not raised her voice, and yet I was struck by its clear and bell-like tone. Ah, it was sweet in my ears! I scarcely dared look at her just then, for fear of betraying myself. A small boy\u0027s cap was perched on her head, and her hair, light brown and arranged in a loose and fluffy order that caught the sun, seemed an aureole about the delicate oval of her face. She was positively bewitching, and, withal, sweetly spirituelle, if not saintly. All my oldtime marvel at life returned to me at sight of this splendid incarnation of it, and Wolf Larsen\u0027s cold explanation of life and its meaning was truly ridiculous and laughable. \n \n \u0027A sentimentalist,\u0027 he sneered, \u0027like Mr. Van Weyden. Those men are cursing because their desires have been outraged. That is all. What desires? The desires for the good grub and soft beds ashore which a handsome payday brings them- the women and the drink, the gorging and the beastliness which so truly express them, the best that is in them, their highest aspirations, their ideals, if you please. The exhibition they make of their feelings is not a touching sight, yet it shows how deeply they have been touched, how deeply their purses have been touched; for to lay hands on their purses is to lay hands on their souls.\u0027 \n \n \u0027You hardly behave as if your purse had been touched,\u0027 she said smilingly. \n \n \u0027Then it so happens that I am behaving differently, for my purse and my soul have both been touched. At the current price of skins in the London market, and based on a fair estimate of what the afternoon\u0027s catch would have been had not the Macedonia hogged it, the Ghost has lost about fifteen hundred dollars\u0027 worth of skins.\u0027 \n \n \u0027You speak so calmly- \u0027 she began. \n \n \u0027But I do not feel calm; I could kill the man who has robbed me,\u0027 he interrupted. \u0027Yes, yes, I know, and that man my brother- more sentiment! Bah!\u0027 \n \n His face underwent a sudden change. His voice was less harsh and wholly sincere as he said: \n \n \u0027You must be happy, you sentimentalists, really and truly happy at dreaming and finding things good, and, because you find some of them good, feeling good yourselves. Now, tell me, you two, do you find me good?\u0027 \n \n \u0027You are good to look upon- in a way,\u0027 I qualified. \n \n \u0027There are in you all powers for good,\u0027 was Maud Brewster\u0027s answer. \n \n \u0027There you are!\u0027 he cried at her, half angrily. \u0027Your words are empty to me. There is nothing clear and sharp and definite about the thought you have expressed. You cannot pick it up in your two hands and look at it. In point of fact, it is not a thought. It is a feeling, a sentiment, a something based upon illusion, and not a product of the intellect at all.\u0027 \n \n As he went on, his voice again grew soft, and a confiding note came into it. \u0027Do you know, I sometimes catch myself wishing that I, too, were blind to the facts of life and knew only its fancies and illusions. They\u0027re wrong, all wrong, of course, and contrary to reason, but in the face of them my reason tells me, wrong and most wrong, that to dream and live illusions give greater delight. And, after all, delight is the wage for living. Without delight, living is a worthless act. To labor at living and be paid is worse than to be dead. He who delights the most, lives the most, and your dreams and unrealities are less disturbing to you and most gratifying than are my facts to me.\u0027 \n \n He shook his head slowly, pondering. \n \n \u0027I often doubt the worthwhileness of reason. Dreams must be more substantial and satisfying. Emotional delight is more filling and lasting than intellectual delight; and, besides, you pay for your moments of intellectual delight by having the blues. Emotional delight is followed by no more than jaded senses, which speedily recuperate. I envy you, I envy you.\u0027 He stopped abruptly, and then on his lips formed one of his strange quizzical smiles, as he added: \u0027It\u0027s from my brain I envy you, take notice, and not from my heart. My reason dictates it. The envy is an intellectual product. I am like a sober man looking upon drunken men, and, greatly weary, wishing he, too, were drunk.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Or like a wise man looking upon fools and wishing he, too, were a fool,\u0027 I laughed. \n \n \u0027Quite so,\u0027 he said. \u0027You are blessed, bankrupt pair of fools. You have no facts in your pocketbook.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Yet we spend as freely as you,\u0027 was Maud Brewster\u0027s contribution. \n \n \u0027More freely, because it costs you nothing.\u0027 \n \n \u0027And because we draw upon eternity,\u0027 she retorted. \n \n \u0027Whether you do or think you do, it\u0027s the same thing. You spend what you haven\u0027t got, and in return you get greater value from spending what you haven\u0027t got than I get from spending what I have got and what I have sweated to get.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Why don\u0027t you change the basis of your coinage, then?\u0027 she queried teasingly. \n \n He looked at her quickly, half hopefully, and then said, all regretfully: \u0027Too late. I\u0027d like to, perhaps, but I can\u0027t. My pocketbook is stuffed with the old coinage, and it\u0027s a stubborn thing. I can never bring myself to recognize anything else as valid.\u0027 \n \n He ceased speaking, and his gaze wandered absently past her and became lost in the placid sea. The old primal melancholy was strong upon him. He was quivering to it. He had reasoned himself into a spell of the blues, and within a few hours one could look for the devil within him to be up and stirring. I remembered Charley Furuseth, and knew this man\u0027s sadness for the penalty which the materialist ever pays for his materialism. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/94/4935.html","bookId":293,"book":{"id":293,"title":"The Sea-Wolf海狼","description":"简介： The Sea-Wolf is a 1904 psychological adventure novel by American novelist Jack London about a literary critic and other survivors of an ocean collision who come under the dominance of Wolf Larsen, the powerful and amoral sea captain who rescues ...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1289609238bf31c.jpg","type":"Inspirational","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/94","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:30 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:30 AM"}}
