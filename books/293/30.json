{"id":20827,"no":30,"title":"Chapter 30","content":"NO WONDER WE CALLED IT Endeavor Island. For two weeks we toiled at building a hut. Maud insisted on helping, and I could have wept over her bruised and bleeding hands. And still, I was proud of her because of it. There was something heroic about this gently bred woman enduring our terrible hardship and with her pittance of strength bending to the tasks of a peasant woman. She gathered many of the stones that I built into the walls of the hut; also, she turned a deaf ear to my entreaties when I begged her to desist. She compromised, however, by taking upon herself the lighter labors of cooking and of gathering driftwood and moss for our winter\u0027s supply. \\n\\n \\n\\n The hut\u0027s walls rose without difficulty, and everything went smoothly until the problem of the roof confronted me. Of what use the four walls without a roof? And of what could a roof be made? There were the spare oars, very true. They would serve as roof-beams; but with what was I to cover them? Moss would never do. Tundra grass was impracticable. We needed the sail for the boat, and the tarpaulin had begun to leak. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Winters used walrus-skins on his hut,\u0027 I said. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027There are the seals,\u0027 she suggested. \\n\\n \\n\\n So next day the hunting began. I did not know how to shoot, but I proceeded to learn. And when I had expended some thirty shells for three seals, I decided that the ammunition would be exhausted before I acquired the necessary knowledge. I had used eight shells for lighting fires before I hit upon the device of banking the embers with wet moss, and there remained not over a hundred shells in the box. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027We must club the seals,\u0027 I announced, when convinced of my poor marksmanship. \u0027I have heard the sealers talk about clubbing them.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027They are so pretty,\u0027 she objected. \u0027I cannot bear to think of it being done. It is so directly brutal, you know, so different from shooting them.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027That roof must go on,\u0027 I answered grimly. \u0027Winter is almost here. It is our lives against theirs. It is unfortunate we haven\u0027t plenty of ammunition, but I think, anyway, that they suffer less from being clubbed than from being all shot up. Besides, I shall do the clubbing.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s just it,\u0027 she began eagerly, and broke off in sudden confusion. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Of course,\u0027 I began, \u0027if you prefer-\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027But what shall I be doing?\u0027 she interrupted, with that softness I knew full well to be insistence. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Gathering firewood and cooking dinner,\u0027 I answered lightly. \\n\\n \\n\\n She shook her head. \u0027It is too dangerous for you to attempt alone.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I know, I know,\u0027 she waived my protest. \u0027I am only a weak woman, but just my small assistance may enable you to escape disaster.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027But the clubbing?\u0027 I suggested. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Of course you will do that. I shall probably scream. I\u0027ll look away when-\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027The danger is most serious,\u0027 I laughed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I shall use my judgment when to look and when not to look,\u0027 she replied, with a grand air. \\n\\n \\n\\n The upshot of the affair was that she accompanied me next morning. I rowed into the adjoining cove and up to the edge of the beach. There were seals all about us in the water, and the bellowing thousands on the beach compelled us to shout at each other to make ourselves heard. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I know men club them,\u0027 I said, trying to reassure myself, and gazing doubtfully at a large bull, not thirty feet away, upreared on his fore flippers and regarding me intently. \u0027But the question is, how do they club them?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Let us gather tundra grass and thatch the roof,\u0027 Maud said. \\n\\n \\n\\n She was as frightened as I at the prospect, and we had reason to be, gazing at close range at the gleaming teeth and dog-like mouths. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I always thought they were afraid of men,\u0027 I said. \u0027How do I know they are not afraid?\u0027 I queried a moment later, after having rowed a few more strokes along the beach. \u0027Perhaps if I were to step boldly ashore, they would cut for it and I could not catch up with one.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n And still I hesitated. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I heard of a man once that invaded the nesting-grounds of wild geese,\u0027 Maud said. \u0027They killed him.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027The geese?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Yes, the geese. My brother told me about it when I was a little girl.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027But I know men club them,\u0027 I persisted. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I think the tundra grass will make just as good a roof,\u0027 she said. \\n\\n \\n\\n Far from her intention, her words were maddening me, driving me on. I could not play the coward before her eyes. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Here goes,\u0027 I said, backing water with one oar and running the bow ashore. \\n\\n \\n\\n I stepped out and advanced valiantly upon a long-maned bull in the midst of his wives. I was armed with the regular club with which the boat-pullers killed the wounded seals gaffed aboard by the hunters. It was only a foot and a half long, and in my superb ignorance I never dreamed that the club used ashore when raiding the rookeries measured four or five feet. The cows lumbered out of my way, and the distance between me and the bull decreased. He raised himself on his flippers with an angry movement. We were a dozen feet apart. Still I advanced steadily, looking for him to turn tail at any moment and run. \\n\\n \\n\\n At six feet the panicky thought rushed into my mind: What if he will not run? Why, then I shall club him, came the answer. In my fear I had forgotten that I was there to get the bull instead of to make him run. And just then he gave a snort and a snarl and rushed at me. His eyes were blazing, his mouth was wide open; the teeth gleamed cruelly white. Without shame, I confess that it was I that turned tail and footed it. He ran awkwardly, but he ran well. He was but two paces behind when I tumbled into the boat, and as I shoved off with an oar his teeth crunched down upon the blade. The stout wood was crushed like an egg-shell. Maud and I were astounded. A moment later he had dived under the boat, seized the keel in his mouth, and was shaking the boat violently. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027My!\u0027 said Maud. \u0027Let\u0027s go back.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n I shook my head. \u0027I can do what other men have done, and I know that other men have clubbed seals. But I think I\u0027ll leave the bulls alone next time. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I wish you wouldn\u0027t,\u0027 she said. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Now don\u0027t say, \"Please, please,\"\u0027 I cried, half angrily, I do believe. \\n\\n \\n\\n She made no reply, and I knew my tone must have hurt her. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I beg your pardon,\u0027 I said, or shouted, rather, in order to make myself heard above the roar of the rookery. \u0027If you say so, I\u0027ll turn and go back; but honestly, I\u0027d rather stay.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Now, don\u0027t say that this is what you get for bringing a woman along,\u0027 she said. She smiled at me whimsically, gloriously, and I knew there was no need for forgiveness. \\n\\n \\n\\n I rowed a couple of hundred feet along the beach so as to recover my nerves, and then stepped ashore again. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Do be cautious!\u0027 she called after me. \\n\\n \\n\\n I nodded my head and proceeded to make a flank attack on the nearest harem. All went until I aimed a blow at an outlying cow\u0027s head and fell short. She snorted and tried to scramble away. I ran in close and struck another blow, hitting the shoulder instead of the head. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Look out!\u0027 I heard Maud scream. \\n\\n \\n\\n In my excitement I had not been taking notice of other things, and I looked up to see the lord of the harem charging down upon me. Again I fled to the boat, hotly pursued; but this time Maud made no suggestion of turning back. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027It would be better, I imagine, if you let harems alone and devoted your attention to lonely and inoffensive-looking seals,\u0027 was what she said. \u0027I think I have read something about them- Dr. Jordan\u0027s book, I believe. They are the young bulls, not old enough to have harems of their own. He called them the holluschickie, or something like that. It seems to me, if we find where they haul out-\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027It seems to me that your fighting instinct is aroused,\u0027 I laughed. \\n\\n \\n\\n She flushed quickly and prettily. \u0027I\u0027ll admit I don\u0027t like defeat any more than you do, nor any more than I like the idea of killing such pretty, inoffensive creatures.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Pretty!\u0027 I sniffed. \u0027I failed to mark anything preeminently pretty about those foamy-mouthed beasts that raced me.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Your point of view,\u0027 she laughed. \u0027You lacked perspective. Now if you did not have to get so close to the subject-\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027The very thing!\u0027 I cried. \u0027What I need is a longer club. And there\u0027s that broken oar ready to hand.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027It just comes to me,\u0027 she said, \u0027that Captain Larsen was telling me how the men raided the rookeries. They drive the seals, in small herds, a short distance inland before they kill them.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t care to undertake the herding of one of those harems,\u0027 I objected. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027But there are the holluschickie,\u0027 she said. \u0027The holluschickie haul out by themselves, and Dr. Jordan says that paths are left between the harems, and that as long as the holluschickie keep strictly to the paths they are unmolested by the masters of the harem.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027There\u0027s one now,\u0027 I said, pointing to a young bull in the water. \u0027Let\u0027s watch him and follow him if he hauls out.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n He swam directly to the beach and clambered out into a small opening between two harems, the masters of which made warning noises, but did not attack him. We watched him travel slowly inland, threading about among the harems along what must have been the path. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Here goes,\u0027 I said, stepping out; but I confess my heart was in my mouth as I thought of going through the heart of that monstrous herd. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027It would be wise to make the boat fast,\u0027 Maud said. \\n\\n \\n\\n She had stepped out beside me, and I regarded her with wonderment. \\n\\n \\n\\n She nodded her head determinedly. \u0027Yes, I\u0027m going with you, so you may as well secure the boat and arm me with a club.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Let\u0027s go back,\u0027 I said dejectedly. \u0027I think tundra grass will do, after all.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You know it won\u0027t,\u0027 was her reply. \u0027Shall I lead?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n With a shrug of the shoulders, but with the warmest admiration and pride at heart for this woman, I equipped her with the broken oar and took another for myself. It was with nervous trepidation that we made the first few rods of the journey. Once Maud screamed in terror as a cow thrust an inquisitive nose toward her foot, and several times I quickened my pace for the same reason. But, beyond warning coughs from each side, there were no signs of hostility. It was a rookery that had never been raided by the hunters, and in consequence the seals were mild-tempered and at the same time unafraid. \\n\\n \\n\\n In the very heart of the herd the din was terrific. It was almost dizzying in its effect. I paused and smiled reassuringly at Maud, for I had recovered my equanimity sooner than she. I could see that she was still badly frightened. She came close to me and shouted: \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m dreadfully afraid!\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n And I was not. Though the novelty had not yet worn off, the peaceful comportment of the seals had quieted my alarm. Maud was trembling. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m afraid, and I\u0027m not afraid,\u0027 she chattered, with shaking jaws. \u0027It\u0027s my miserable body, not I.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s all right; it\u0027s all right,\u0027 I reassured her, my arm passing instinctively and protectingly around her. \\n\\n \\n\\n I shall never forget, in that moment, how instantly conscious I became of my manhood. The primitive deeps of my nature stirred. I felt myself masculine, the protector of the weak, the fighting male. And, best of all, I felt myself the protector of my loved one. She leaned against me, so light and lily-frail, and as her trembling eased away it seemed as though I became aware of prodigious strength. I felt myself a match for the most ferocious bull in the herd, and I know, had such a bull charged upon me, that I would have met him unflinchingly and cooly, and I know that I would have killed him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I am all right now,\u0027 she said, looking up at me gratefully. \u0027Let us go on.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n And that the strength in me had quieted her and given her confidence filled me with an exultant joy. The youth of the race seemed burgeoning in me, over-civilized man that I was, and I lived for myself the old hunting days and forest nights of my remote and forgotten ancestry. I had much for which to thank Wolf Larsen, was my thought as we went along the path between the jostling harems. \\n\\n \\n\\n A quarter of a mile inland we came upon the holluschickie- sleek bulls, living out the loneliness of their bacherlorhood and gathering strength against the day when they would fight their way into the ranks of the benedicts. \\n\\n \\n\\n Everything now went smoothly. I seemed to know just what to do and how to do it. Shouting, making threatening gestures with my club, and even prodding the lazy ones, I quickly cut out a score of the young bachelors from their companions. Whenever one made an attempt to break back toward the water, I headed him off. Maud took an active part in the drive, and with her cries and flourishings of the broken oar was of considerable assistance. I noticed, though, that whenever one looked tired and lagged she let him slip past. But I noticed, also, whenever one, with a show of fight, tried to break past, that her eyes glinted and showed bright and she rapped him smartly with her club. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027My, it\u0027s exciting!\u0027 she cried, pausing from sheer weakness. \u0027I think I\u0027ll sit down.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n I drove the little herd (a dozen strong, now, what of the escapes she had permitted) a hundred yards farther on; and by the time she joined me I had finished the slaughter and was beginning to skin. An hour later went proudly back along the path between the harems. And twice again we came down the path burdened with skins, till I thought we had enough to roof the hut. I set the sail, laid one tack out of the cove, and on the other tack made our own little inner cove. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s just like home-coming,\u0027 Maud said, as I ran the boat ashore. \\n\\n \\n\\n I heard her words with a responsive thrill, it was all so dearly intimate and natural, and I said: \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027It seems as though I have lived this life always. The world of books and bookish folk is very vague, more like a dream-memory than an actuality. I surely have hunted and forayed and fought all the days of my life. And you, too, seem a part of it. You are-\u0027 I was on the verge of saying, \u0027my woman, my mate,\u0027 but glibly changed it to, \u0027standing the hardship well.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n But her ear had caught the flaw. She recognized a flight that midmost broke. She gave me a quick look. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Not that. You were saying-\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027That you are living the life of a savage and living it quite successfully,\u0027 I said easily. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Oh,\u0027 was all she replied; but I could have sworn there was a note of disappointment in her voice. \\n\\n \\n\\n But \u0027my woman, my mate,\u0027 kept ringing in my head for the rest of the day and for many days. Yet never did it ring more loudly than the night, as I watched her draw back the blanket of moss from the coals, blow up the fire, and cook the evening meal. It must have been latent savagery stirring in me for the old words, so bound up with the roots of the race, to grip me and thrill me. And grip and thrill they did, till I fell asleep, murmuring them to myself over and over again. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/94/4941.html","bookId":293,"book":{"id":293,"title":"The Sea-Wolf海狼","description":"简介： The Sea-Wolf is a 1904 psychological adventure novel by American novelist Jack London about a literary critic and other survivors of an ocean collision who come under the dominance of Wolf Larsen, the powerful and amoral sea captain who rescues ...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1289609238bf31c.jpg","type":"Inspirational","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/94","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:30 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:30 AM"}}
