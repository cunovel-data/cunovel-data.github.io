{"id":20809,"no":12,"title":"Chapter 12","content":"THE LAST TWENTY-FOUR HOURS have witnessed a carnival of brutality. From cabin to forecastle it seems to have broken out like a contagion. I scarcely know where to begin. Wolf Larsen was really the cause of it. The relations among the men, strained and made tense by feuds, quarrels, and grudges, were in a state of unstable equilibrium. Wolf Larsen disturbed the equilibrium, and evil passions flared up like flame in prairie-grass. \\n\\n \\n\\n Thomas Mugridge was proving himself a sneak, a spy, an informer. He attempted to curry favor and reinstate himself in the good graces of the captain by carrying tales of the men forward. He it was, I know, that carried some of Johnson\u0027s hasty talk to Wolf Larsen. Johnson, it seems, had bought a suit of oilskins from the slop-chest and found them to be of greatly inferior quality. Nor was he slow in advertising the fact. The slop-chest is a sort of miniature dry-goods store which is carried by all sealing-schooners and which is stocked with articles peculiar to the needs of the sailors. Whatever a sailor purchases is taken from his subsequent earnings on the sealing-grounds; for, as it is with the hunters, so it is with the boat-pullers and steerers: in the place of wages, they receive a \u0027lay,\u0027 a rate of so much per skin for every skin captured in their particular boat. \\n\\n \\n\\n But of Johnson\u0027s grumbling at the slop-chest I knew nothing, so that what I witnessed came with the shock of sudden surprise. I had just finished sweeping the cabin, and had been inveigled by Wolf Larsen into a discussion of Hamlet, his favorite Shakespearean character, when Johansen descended the companion-stairs, followed by Johnson. The latter\u0027s cap came off, after the custom of the sea, and he stood respectfully in the middle of the cabin, swaying heavily and uneasily to the roll of the schooner, and facing the captain. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Shut the doors and draw the slide,\u0027 Wolf Larsen said to me. \\n\\n \\n\\n I noticed an anxious light in Johnson\u0027s eyes, but mistook it for the native shyness and embarrassment of the man. The mate, Johansen, stood away several feet to the side of him, and fully three yards in front of him sat Wolf Larsen on one of the revolving cabin chairs. An appreciable pause fell after I had closed the doors and drawn the slide- a pause that must have lasted fully a minute. It was broken by Wolf Larsen. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Yonson,\u0027 he began. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027My name is Johnson, sir,\u0027 the sailor boldly corrected. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Well, Johnson, then,- you! Can you guess why I have sent for you?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Yes, and no, sir,\u0027 was the slow reply. \u0027My work is done well. The mate knows that, and you know it, sir. So there cannot be any complaint.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027And is that all?\u0027 Wolf Larsen queried, his voice soft and low and purring. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I know you have it in for me,\u0027 Johnson continued with his unalterable and ponderous slowness. \u0027You do not like me. You- you-\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Go on,\u0027 Wolf Larsen prompted. \u0027Don\u0027t be afraid of my feelings.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I am not afraid,\u0027 the sailor retorted, a slight angry flush rising through his sunburn. \u0027You do not like me because I am too much of a man, that is why, sir.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You are too much of a man for ship discipline, if that is what you mean, and if you know what I mean,\u0027 was Wolf Larsen\u0027s retort. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I know English, and I know what you mean, sir,\u0027 Johnson answered, his flush deepening at the slur on his knowledge of the English language. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Johnson,\u0027 Wolf Larsen said, with an air of dismissing all that had gone before as introductory to the main business in hand, \u0027I understand you\u0027re not quite satisfied with those oilskins.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027No, I am not. They are no good, sir.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027And you\u0027ve been shooting off your mouth about them.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I say what I think, sir,\u0027 the sailor answered courageously, not failing at the same time in ship courtesy, which demanded that \u0027sir\u0027 be appended to each speech he made. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was at this moment that I chanced to glance at Johansen. His big fists were clenching and unclenching, and his face was positively fiendish, so malignantly did he look at Johnson. I noticed a black discoloration, still faintly visible, under Johansen\u0027s eye, a mark of the thrashing he had received a few nights before from the sailor. For the first time I began to divine that something terrible was about to be enacted- what, I could not imagine. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Do you know what happens to men who say what you\u0027ve said about my slop-chest and me?\u0027 Wolf Larsen was demanding. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I know, sir,\u0027 was the answer. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027 Wolf Larsen demanded sharply and imperatively. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027What you and the mate there are going to do to me, sir.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n At this Larsen sprang from the sitting posture like a wild animal, a tiger, and like a tiger covered the intervening space in an avalanche of fury that Johnson strove vainly to fend off. He threw one arm down to protect the stomach, the other arm up to protect the head; but Wolf Larsen\u0027s fist drove midway between, on the chest, with a crushing, resounding impact. Johnson\u0027s breath, suddenly expelled, shot from his mouth, and as suddenly checked, with the forced, audible expiration of a man wielding an ax. He almost fell backward, and swayed from side to side in an effort to recover his balance. \\n\\n \\n\\n Johnson fought bravely enough, but he was no match for Wolf Larsen, much less for Wolf Larsen and the mate. It was frightful. I had not imagined a human being could endure so much and still live and struggle on. And struggle on Johnson did. Of course there was no hope for him, not the slightest, and he knew it as well as I, but by the manhood that was in him he could not cease from fighting for that manhood. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was too much for me to witness. I felt that I should lose my mind, and I ran up the companion-stairs to open the doors and escape on deck. But Wolf Larsen, leaving his victim for the moment, and with one of his tremendous springs, gained my side, and flung me into the far corner of the cabin. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027The phenomenon of life, Hump,\u0027 he girded at me. \u0027Stay and watch it. You may gather data on the immortality of the soul. Besides, you know, we can\u0027t hurt Johnson\u0027s soul. It\u0027s only the fleeting form we may demolish.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n It seemed centuries, possibly it was no more than ten minutes, that the beating continued. And when Johnson could no longer rise, they still continued to beat and kick him where he lay. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Easy, Johansen; easy as she goes,\u0027 Wolf Larsen finally said. \\n\\n \\n\\n But the beast in the mate was up and rampant, and Wolf Larsen was compelled to brush him away with a back-handed sweep of the arm, gentle enough, apparently, but which hurled Johansen back like a cork, driving his head against the wall with a crash. He fell to the floor, half stunned for the moment, breathing heavily and blinking his eyes in a stupid sort of way. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Jerk open the doors, Hump,\u0027 Larsen commanded. \\n\\n \\n\\n I obeyed, and the two brutes picked up the senseless man like a sack of rubbish and hove him clear up the companion-stairs, through the narrow doors, and out on deck. Louis, his boat-mate, gave a turn of the wheel and gazed imperturbably into the binnacle. \\n\\n \\n\\n Not so George Leach, the erstwhile cabin-boy. Fore and aft there was nothing that could have surprised us more than his consequent behavior. He it was that came up on the poop, without orders, and dragged Johnson forward, where he set about dressing his wounds as well as he could and making him comfortable. \\n\\n \\n\\n I had come up on deck for a breath of fresh air and to try to get some repose for my overwrought nerves. Wolf Larsen was smoking a cigar and examining the patent log which the Ghost usually towed astern, but which had been hauled in for some purpose. Suddenly Leach\u0027s voice came to my ears. It was tense and hoarse with an overmastering rage. I turned and saw him standing just beneath the break of the poop on the port side of the galley. His face was convulsed and white, his eyes were flashing, his clenched fists raised overhead, as the boy hurled his imprecations recklessly full in the face of the captain, who had sauntered slowly forward to the break of the poop, and leaning his elbow on the corner of the cabin, gazed down thoughtfully and curiously at the excited boy. \\n\\n \\n\\n Leach went on, indicting Wolf Larsen as he had never been indicted before. The sailors assembled in a fearful group just outside the forecastle scuttle, and watched and listened. The hunters piled pell-mell out of the steerage, but as Leach\u0027s tirade continued I saw that there was no levity in their faces. Even they were frightened, not at the boy\u0027s terrible words, but at his terrible audacity. It did not seem possible that any living creature could thus beard Wolf Larsen to his teeth. I know for myself that I was shocked into admiration of the boy, and I saw in him the splendid invincibleness of immortality rising above the flesh and the fears of the flesh, as in the prophets of old, to condemn unrighteousness. \\n\\n \\n\\n And such condemnation! He haled forth Wolf Larsen\u0027s soul naked to the scorn of men. He rained upon it curses from God and high heaven, and withered it with a heat of invective that savored of a medieval excommunication of the Catholic Church. He ran the gamut of denunciation, rising to heights of wrath, and from sheer exhaustion sinking to the most indecent abuse. \\n\\n \\n\\n Everybody looked for Larsen to leap upon the boy and destroy him. But it was not his whim. His cigar went out, and he continued to gaze silently and curiously. \\n\\n \\n\\n Leach had worked himself into an ecstasy of impotent rage. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Pig! Pig! Pig!\u0027 he was reiterating at the top of his lungs. \u0027Why don\u0027t you come down and kill me, you murderer? You can do it. I ain\u0027t afraid. There\u0027s no one to stop you! Come on, you coward! Kill me! Kill me! Kill me!\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n It was at this stage that Thomas Mugridge\u0027s erratic soul brought him into the scene. He had been listening at the galley door, but he now came out, ostensibly to fling some scraps over the side, but obviously to see the killing he was certain would take place. He smirked greasily up into the face of Wolf Larsen, who seemed not to see him. But the Cockney was unabashed, and turned to Leach, saying: \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Such language! Shockin\u0027!\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Leach\u0027s rage was no longer impotent. Here at last was something ready to hand, and for the first time since the stabbing the Cockney had appeared outside the galley without his knife. The words had barely left his mouth when he was knocked down by Leach. Three times he struggled to his feet, striving to gain the galley, and each time was knocked down. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Oh, Lord!\u0027 he cried. \u0027\u0027Elp! \u0027Elp! Tyke \u0027im aw\u0027y, carn\u0027t yer? Tyke \u0027im aw\u0027y!\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n The hunters laughed from sheer relief. Tragedy had dwindled, the farce had begun. The sailors now crowded boldly aft, grinning and shuffling, to watch the pommeling of the hated Cockney. And even I felt a great joy surge up within me. I confess that I delighted in this beating Leach was giving to Thomas Mugridge, though it was as terrible, almost, as the one Mugridge had caused to be given to Johnson. But the expression of Wolf Larsen\u0027s face did not change,- nor did his position. For all his pragmatic certitude, it seemed as if he watched the play and movement of life in the hope of discovering something more about it. And no one interfered. Leach could have killed the Cockney, but, having evidently filled the measure of his vengeance, he drew away from his prostrate foe, who was whimpering and wailing in a puppyish sort of way, and walked forward. \\n\\n \\n\\n But these two affairs were only the opening events of the day\u0027s program. In the afternoon Smoke and Henderson fell foul of each other, and a fusillade of shots came up from the steerage, followed by a stampede of the other four hunters for the deck. A column of thick, acrid smoke, the kind always made by black powder, was arising through the open companion-way, and down through it leaped Wolf Larsen. The sound of blows and scuffling came to our ears. Both men were wounded, and he was thrashing them both for having disobeyed his orders and crippled themselves in advance of the hunting season. In fact, they were badly wounded, and, having thrashed them, he proceeded to operate upon them in a rough surgical fashion and to dress their wounds. I served as assistant while he probed and cleansed the passages made by the bullets, and I saw the two men endure his crude surgery without anesthetics and with no more to uphold them than a stiff tumbler of whiskey. \\n\\n \\n\\n Then, in the first dog-watch, trouble came to a head in the forecastle. It took its rise out of the tittle-tattle and tale-bearing that had been the cause of Johnson\u0027s beating, and from the noise we heard, and from the sight of the bruised men next day, it was patent that half the forecastle had soundly drubbed the other half. \\n\\n \\n\\n The second dog-watch and the day wound up with a fight between Johansen and the lean, Yankee-looking hunter, Latimer. It was caused by some remarks of Latimer\u0027s concerning the noises made by the mate in his sleep, and though Johansen was whipped, he kept the steerage awake for the rest of the night while he blissfully slumbered and fought the fight over and over again. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/94/4923.html","bookId":293,"book":{"id":293,"title":"The Sea-Wolf海狼","description":"简介： The Sea-Wolf is a 1904 psychological adventure novel by American novelist Jack London about a literary critic and other survivors of an ocean collision who come under the dominance of Wolf Larsen, the powerful and amoral sea captain who rescues ...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1289609238bf31c.jpg","type":"Inspirational","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/94","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:30 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:30 AM"}}
