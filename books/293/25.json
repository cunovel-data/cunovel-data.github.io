{"id":20822,"no":25,"title":"Chapter 25","content":"YOU\u0027VE BEEN ON DECK, Mr. Van Weyden,\u0027 Wolf Larsen said the following morning at the breakfast-table. \u0027How do things look?\u0027 \u0027Clear enough,\u0027 I answered, glancing at the sunshine which streamed down the open companionway. \u0027Fair westerly breeze, with a promise of stiffening, if Louis predicts correctly.\u0027 He nodded his head in a pleased way. \u0027Any signs of fog?\u0027 \u0027Thick banks in the north and northwest.\u0027 He nodded his head again, evincing even greater satisfaction than before. \u0027What of the Macedonia?\u0027 \u0027Not sighted,\u0027 I answered. I could have sworn his face fell at the intelligence, but why he should be disappointed I could not conceive. I was soon to learn. \u0027Smoke ho!\u0027 came the hail from on deck, and his face brightened. \u0027Good!\u0027 he exclaimed, and left the table at once to go on deck and into the steerage, where the hunters were taking the first breakfast of their exile. Maud Brewster and I scarcely touched the food before us, gazing, instead, in silent anxiety at each other and listening to Wolf Larsen\u0027s voice, which easily penetrated the cabin through the intervening bulkhead. He spoke at length, and his conclusion was greeted with a wild roar of cheers. The bulkhead was too thick for us to hear what he said; but, whatever it was, it had affected the hunters strongly, for the cheering was followed by loud exclamations and shouts of joy. From the sounds on deck I knew that the sailors had been routed out and were preparing to lower the boats. Maud Brewster accompanied me on deck, but I left her at the break of the poop, where she might watch the scene and not be in it. The sailors must have learned whatever project was on hand, and the vim and snap they put into their work attested their enthusiasm. The hunters came trooping on deck with shotguns and ammunition-boxes, and, most unusual, their rifles. The latter were rarely taken in the boats, for a seal shot at long range with a rifle invariably sank before a boat could reach it. But each hunter this day had his rifle and a large supply of cartridges. I noticed they grinned with satisfaction whenever they looked at the Macedonia\u0027s smoke, which was rising higher and higher as she approached from the west. The five boats went over the side with a rush, spread out like the ribs of a fan, and set a northerly course, as on the preceding afternoon, for us to follow. I watched for some time, curiously, but there seemed nothing extraordinary about their behavior. They lowered sails, shot seals, and hoisted sails again and continued on their way, as I had always seen them do. The Macedonia repeated her performance of yesterday, \u0027hogging\u0027 the sea by dropping her line of boats in advance of ours and across our course. Fourteen boats require a considerable spread of ocean for comfortable hunting, and when she had completely lapped our line she continued steaming into the northeast, dropping more boats as she went. \u0027What\u0027s up?\u0027 I asked Wolf Larsen, unable longer to keep my curiosity in check. \u0027Never mind what\u0027s up,\u0027 he answered gruffly. \u0027You won\u0027t be a thousand years in finding out, and in the meantime just pray for plenty of wind. \u0027Oh, well, I don\u0027t mind telling you,\u0027 he said the next moment. \u0027I\u0027m going to give that brother of mine a taste of his own medicine. In short, I\u0027m going to play the hog myself, and not for one day, but for the rest of the season- if we\u0027re in luck.\u0027 \u0027And if we\u0027re not?\u0027 I queried. \u0027Not to be considered,\u0027 he laughed. \u0027We simply must be in luck, or it\u0027s all up with us.\u0027 He had the wheel at the time, and I went forward to my hospital in the forecastle, where lay the two cripped men, Nilson and Thomas Mugridge. Nilson was as cheerful as could be expected, for his broken leg was knitting nicely; but the Cockney was desperately melancholy, and I was aware of a great sympathy for the unfortunate creature. And the marvel of it was that still he lived and clung to life. The brutal years had reduced his meager body to splintered wreckage, and yet the spark of light within burned as brightly as ever. \u0027With an artificial foot,- and they make excellent ones,- you will be stumping ships\u0027 galleys to the end of time,\u0027 I assured him, jovially. But his answer was serious, nay, solemn. \u0027I don\u0027t know about wot you s\u0027y, Mr. Van W\u0027yden, but I do know I\u0027ll never rest \u0027appy till I see that \u0027ell-\u0027ound dead. \u0027E cawn\u0027t live as long as me. \u0027E\u0027s got no right to live, an\u0027, as the Good Word puts it, \"\u0027E shall shorely die,\" an\u0027 I s\u0027y, \"Amen, an\u0027 d- soon at that.\"\u0027 When I returned on deck I found Wolf Larsen steering mainly with one hand, while with the other hand he held the marine glasses and studied the situation of the boats, paying particular attention to the position of the Macedonia. The only change noticeable in our boats was that they had hauled close on the wind and were heading several points west of north. Still, I could not see the expediency of the maneuver, for the free sea was intercepted by the Macedonia\u0027s five weather boats, which, in turn, had hauled close on the wind. Thus they slowly diverged toward the west, drawing farther and farther away from the remainder of the boats in their line. Our boats were rowing as well as sailing. Even the hunters were pulling, and with three pairs of oars in the water they rapidly overhauled what I may appropriately term the enemy. The smoke of the Macedonia had dwindled to a dim blot on the northeastern horizon. Of the steamer herself nothing was to be seen. We had been loafing along till now, our sails shaking half the time and spilling the wind; and twice, for short periods, we had been hove to. But there was no more loafing. Sheets were trimmed, and Wolf Larsen proceeded to put the Ghost through her paces. We ran past our line of boats and bore down upon the first weather boat of the other line. \u0027Down that flying jib, Mr. Van Weyden,\u0027 Wolf Larsen commanded. \u0027And stand by to back over the jibs.\u0027 I ran forward, and had the downhaul of the flying jib all in and fast as we slipped by the boat a hundred feet to leeward. The three men in it gazed at us suspiciously. They had been hogging the sea, and they knew Wolf Larsen by reputation at any rate. I noted that the hunter, a huge Scandinavian sitting in the bow, held his rifle, ready to hand, across his knees. It should have been in its proper place in the rack. When they came opposite our stern, Wolf Larsen greeted them with a wave of the hand, and cried: \u0027Come on aboard and have a \"gam\"?\u0027 \u0027To gam,\u0027 among the sealing-schooners, is a substitute for the verbs \u0027to visit,\u0027 \u0027to gossip.\u0027 It expresses the garrulity of the sea, and is a pleasant break in the monotony of the life. The Ghost swung around into the wind, and I finished my work forward in time to run aft and lend a hand with the main-sheet. \u0027You will please stay on deck, Miss Brewster,\u0027 Wolf Larsen said, as he started forward to meet his guest. \u0027And you, too, Mr. Van Weyden.\u0027 The boat had lowered its sail and run alongside. The hunter, golden-bearded like a sea-king, came over the rail and dropped on deck. But his hugeness could not quite overcome his apprehensiveness. Doubt and distrust showed strongly in his face. It was a transparent face, for all of its hairy shield, and advertised instant relief when he glanced from Wolf Larsen to me, noted that there was only the pair of us, and then glanced over his own two men, who had joined him. Surely he had little reason to be afraid. He towered like a Goliath above Wolf Larsen. He must have measured six feet eight or nine inches in stature, and I subsequently learned his weight- two hundred and forty pounds. And there was no fat about him; it was all bone and muscle. A return of apprehension was apparent, when, at the top of the companionway. Wolf Larsen invited him below. But he reassured himself with a glance down at his host, a big man himself, but dwarfed by the propinquity of the giant. So all hesitancy vanished, and the pair descended into the cabin. In the meantime his two men, as was the wont of visiting sailors, had gone forward into the forecastle to do some visiting themselves. Suddenly from the cabin came a great choking bellow, followed by all the sounds of a furious struggle. It was the leopard and the lion, and the lion made all the noise. Wolf Larsen was the leopard. \u0027You see the sacredness of our hospitality,\u0027 I said bitterly to Maud Brewster. She nodded her head that she heard, and I noted in her face the signs of the same sickness at sight or sound of violent struggle from which I had suffered so severely during my first weeks on the Ghost. \u0027Wouldn\u0027t it be better if you went forward, say by the steerage companionway, until it is over?\u0027 I suggested. She shook her head and gazed at me pitifully. She was not frightened, but appalled, rather, at the human animality of it. \u0027You will understand,\u0027 I took advantage of the opportunity to say, \u0027whatever part I take in what is going on and what is to come, that I am compelled to take it- if you and I are ever to get out of this scrape with our lives. It is not nice- for me,\u0027 I added. \u0027I understand,\u0027 she said in a weak, far-away voice, and her eyes showed me that she did understand. The sounds from below soon died away. Then Wolf Larsen came alone on deck. There was slight flush under his bronze, but otherwise he bore no signs of the battle. \u0027Send those two men aft, Mr. Van Weyden,\u0027 he said. I obeyed, and a minute or two later they stood before him. \u0027Hoist in your boat,\u0027 he said to them. \u0027Your hunter\u0027s decided to stay aboard awhile and doesn\u0027t want it pounding alongside.\u0027 \u0027Hoist in your boat, I said,\u0027 he repeated, this time in sharper tones, as they hesitated to do his bidding. \u0027Who knows, you may have to sail with me for a time,\u0027 he said quite softly, with a silken threat that belied the softness, as they moved slowly to comply, \u0027and we might as well start with a friendly understanding. Lively now! Death Larsen makes you jump better than that, and you know it.\u0027 Their movements perceptibly quickened under his coaching, and as the boat swung inboard I was sent forward to let go the jibs. Wolf Larsen, at the wheel, directed the Ghost after the Macedonia\u0027s second weather boat. Under way, and with nothing for the time being to do, I turned my attention to the situation of the boats. The Macedonia\u0027s third weather boat was being attacked by two. of ours, the fourth by our remaining three; and the fifth, turn about, was taking a hand in the defense of its nearest mate. The fight had opened at long distance, and the rifles were cracking steadily. A quick, snappy sea was being kicked up by the wind, a condition which prevented fine shooting; and now and again, as we drew closer, we could see the bullets zip-zipping from wave to wave. The boat we were pursuing had squared away and was running before the wind to escape us, and, in the course of its flight, to take part in repulsing our general boat attack. Attending to sheets and tacks now left me little time to see what was taking place, but I happened to be on the poop when Wolf Larsen ordered the two strange sailors forward and into the forecastle, They went sullenly, but they went. He next ordered Miss Brewster below, and smiled at the instant horror that leapt into her eyes. \u0027You\u0027ll find nothing gruesome down there,\u0027 he said. \u0027Only an unhurt man securely made fast to the ring-bolts. Bullets are liable to come aboard, and I don\u0027t want you killed, you know.\u0027 Even as he spoke, a bullet was deflected by a brass-capped spoke of the wheel between his hands and screeched off through the air to windward. \u0027You see,\u0027 he said to her; and then to me, \u0027Mr. Van Weyden, will you take the wheel?\u0027 Maud Brewster had stepped inside the companionway, so that only her head was exposed. Wolf Larsen had procured a rifle and was throwing a cartridge into the barrel. I begged her with my eyes to go below, but she smiled and said: \u0027We may be feeble land-creatures without legs, but we can show Captain Larsen that we are at least as brave as he.\u0027 He gave her a quick look of admiration. \u0027I like you a hundred percent better for that,\u0027 he said. \u0027Books, and brains, and bravery. You are well rounded- a blue-stocking fit to be the wife of a pirate chief. Ahem! we\u0027ll discuss that later,\u0027 he smiled, as a bullet struck solidly into the cabin wall. I saw his eyes flash golden as he spoke, and I saw the terror mount in her own. \u0027We are braver,\u0027 I hastened to say. \u0027At least, speaking for myself, I know I am braver than Captain Larsen.\u0027 It was I who was now favored by a quick look. He was wondering if I was making fun of him. I put three or four spokes over to counteract a sheer toward the wind on the part of the Ghost, and then steadied her. Wolf Larsen was still waiting an explanation, and I pointed down to my knees. \u0027You will observe there,\u0027 I said, slight trembling. It is because I am afraid, the flesh is afraid; and I am afraid in my mind because I do not wish to die. But my spirit masters the trembling flesh and the qualms of the mind. I am more than brave: I am courageous. Your flesh is not afraid. You are not afraid. On the one hand, it costs you nothing to encounter danger; on the other, it even gives you delight. You enjoy it. You may be unafraid, Mr. Larsen, but you must grant that the bravery is mine.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027re right,\u0027 he acknowledged at once. \u0027I never thought of it in that way before. But is the opposite true? If you are braver than I, am I more cowardly than you?\u0027 We both laughed at the absurdity, and he dropped down to the deck and rested his rifle across the rail. The bullets we had received had traveled nearly a mile, but by now we had cut that distance in half. He fired three careful shots. The first struck fifty feet to windward of the boat, the second alongside; and at the third the boat-steerer let loose his steering-oar and crumpled up in the bottom of the boat. \u0027I guess that\u0027ll fix them,\u0027 Wolf Larsen said, rising to his feet. \u0027I couldn\u0027t afford to let the hunter have it, and there is a chance the boat-puller doesn\u0027t know how to steer. In which case, the hunter cannot steer and shoot at the same time.\u0027 His reasoning was justified, for the boat rushed at once into the wind, and the hunter sprang aft to take the boat-steerer\u0027s place. There was no more shooting, though the rifles were still cracking merrily from the other boats. The hunter had managed to get the boat before the wind again, but we ran down upon it, going at least two feet to its one. A hundred yards away I saw the boat-puller pass a rifle to the hunter. Wolf Larsen went amidships and took the coil of the throat-halyards from its pin. Then he peered over the rail with leveled rifle. Twice I saw the hunter let go the steering-oar with one hand, reach for his rifle, and hesitate. We were now alongside and foaming past. \u0027Here, you!\u0027 Wolf Larsen cried suddenly to the boat-puller. \u0027Take a turn!\u0027 At the same time he flung the coil of rope. It struck fairly, nearly knocking the man over, but he did not obey. Instead, he looked to his hunter for orders. The hunter, in turn, was in a quandary. His rifle was between his knees, but if he let go the steering-oar in order to shoot, the boat would sweep around and collide with the schooner. Also, he saw Wolf Larsen\u0027s rifle bearing upon him and knew he would be shot before he could get his rifle into play. \u0027Take a turn,\u0027 he said quietly to the man. The boat-puller obeyed, taking a turn around the little forward thwart and paying out the line as it jerked taut. The boat sheered out with a rush, and the hunter steadied it to a parallel course some twenty feet from the side of the Ghost. \u0027Now get that sail down and come alongside!\u0027 Wolf Larsen ordered. He never let go his rifle, even passing down the tackles with one hand. When they were fast, bow and stern, and the two uninjured men prepared to come aboard, the hunter picked up his rifle as if to place it in a secure position. \u0027Drop it!\u0027 Wolf Larsen cried, and the hunter dropped it as though it were hot and had burned him. Once aboard, the two prisoners hoisted in the boat, and under Wolf Larsen\u0027s direction carried the wounded boat-steerer down into the forecastle. \u0027If our five boats do as well as you and I have done, we\u0027ll have a pretty full crew,\u0027 Wolf Larsen said to me. \u0027The man you shot- he is- I hope?\u0027 Maud Brewster quavered. \u0027In the shoulder,\u0027 he answered. \u0027Nothing serious. Mr. Van Weyden will pull him around as good as ever in three or four weeks\u0027. \u0027But he won\u0027t pull those chaps around, from the look of it,\u0027 he added, pointing at the Macedonia\u0027s third boat, for which I had been steering and which was now nearly abreast of us. \u0027That\u0027s Horner\u0027s and Smoke\u0027s work. I told them we wanted live men, not carcasses. But the joy of shooting to hit is a most compelling thing, when once you\u0027ve learned how to shoot. Have you ever experienced it, Mr. Van Weyden?\u0027 I shook my head and regarded their work. It had indeed been bloody, for they had drawn off and joined our other three boats in the attack on the remaining two of the enemy. The deserted boat was in the trough of the sea, rolling drunkenly across each comber, its loose spritsail out at right angles to it and fluttering and flapping in the wind. The hunter and boat-puller were both lying awkwardly in the bottom, but the boat-steerer lay across the gunwale, half in and half out, his arms trailing in the water and his head rolling from side to side. \u0027Don\u0027t look, Miss Brewster, please don\u0027t look!\u0027 I had begged of her, and I was glad that she had minded me and been spared the sight. \u0027Head right into the bunch, Mr. Van Weyden,\u0027 was Wolf Larsen\u0027s command. As we drew nearer, the firing ceased, and we saw that the fight was over. The remaining two boats had been captured by our five, and the seven were grouped together, waiting to be picked up. \u0027Look at that!\u0027 I cried involuntarily, pointing to the northeast. The blot of smoke which indicated the Macedonia\u0027s position had reappeared. \u0027Yes, I\u0027ve been watching it,\u0027 was Wolf Larsen\u0027s calm reply. He measured the distance away to the fog-bank, and for an instant paused to feel the weight of the wind on his cheek. \u0027We\u0027ll make it, I think; but you can depend upon it that blessed brother of mine has twigged our little game and is just a-humping for us. Ah, look at that!\u0027 The blot of smoke had suddenly grown larger, and it was very black. \u0027I\u0027ll beat you out, though, brother mine,\u0027 he chuckled. \u0027I\u0027ll beat you out, and I hope you no worse than that you rack your old engines into scrap.\u0027 When we hove to, a hasty though orderly confusion reigned. The boats came aboard from every side at once. As fast as the prisoners came over the rail they were marshaled forward into the forecastle by our hunters, while our sailors hoisted in the boats, dropping them anywhere upon the deck and not stopping to lash them. We were already under way, all sails set and drawing, and the sheets being slacked off for a wind abeam, as the last boat lifted clear of the water and swung in the tackles.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/94/4936.html","bookId":293,"book":{"id":293,"title":"The Sea-Wolf海狼","description":"简介： The Sea-Wolf is a 1904 psychological adventure novel by American novelist Jack London about a literary critic and other survivors of an ocean collision who come under the dominance of Wolf Larsen, the powerful and amoral sea captain who rescues ...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1289609238bf31c.jpg","type":"Inspirational","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/94","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:30 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:30 AM"}}
