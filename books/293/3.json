{"id":20800,"no":3,"title":"Chapter 3","content":"WOLF LARSEN CEASED SWEARING as suddenly as he had begun. He relighted his cigar and glanced around. His eyes chanced upon the cook. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Well, Cooky?\u0027 he began, with a suaveness that was cold and of the temper of steel. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Yes, sir,\u0027 the cook eagerly interpolated, with appeasing and apologetic servility. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t you think you\u0027ve stretched that neck of yours just about enough? It\u0027s unhealthy, you know. The mate\u0027s gone, so I can\u0027t afford to lose you, too. You must be very, very careful of your health, Cooky. Understand?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n His last word, in striking contrast with the smoothness of his previous utterance, snapped like the lash of a whip. The cook quailed under it. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Yes, sir,\u0027 was the meek reply, as the offending head disappeared into the galley. \\n\\n \\n\\n At this rebuke the rest of the crew became uninterested and fell to work at one task or another. A number of men, however, who were lounging about a companionway between the galley and the hatch, and who did not seem to be sailors, continued talking in low tones with one another. These, I afterward learned, were the hunters, the men who shot the seals, and a very superior breed to common sailor-folk. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Johansen!\u0027 Wolf Larsen called out. A sailor stepped forward obediently. \u0027Get your palm and needle and sew the beggar up. You\u0027ll find some old canvas in the sail-locker. Make it do.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027What\u0027ll I put on his feet, sir?\u0027 the man asked, after the customary \u0027Aye, aye, sir.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027We\u0027ll see to that,\u0027 Wolf Larsen answered, and elevated his voice in a cal of \u0027Cooky!\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Thomas Mugridge popped out of his galley like a jack-in-the-box. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Go below and fill a sack with coal.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Any of you fellows got a Bible or prayer-book?\u0027 was the captain\u0027s next demand, this time of the hunters lounging about the companionway. \\n\\n \\n\\n They shook their heads, and some one made a jocular remark which I did not catch, but which raised a general laugh. \\n\\n \\n\\n Wolf Larsen made the same demand of the sailors. Bibles and prayer-books seemed scarce articles, but one of the men volunteered to pursue the quest among the watch below, returning in a minute with the information that \u0027they ain\u0027t none.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n The captain shrugged his shoulders. \u0027Then we\u0027ll drop him over without any palavering, unless our clerical-looking castaway has the burial service at sea by heart.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n By this time he had swung fully around and was facing me. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re a preacher, aren\u0027t you?\u0027 he asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n The hunters- there were six of them- to a man turned and regarded me. I was painfully aware of my likeness to a scarecrow. A laugh went up at my appearance- a laugh that was not lessened or softened by the dead man stretched and grinning on the deck before us; a laugh that was as rough and harsh and frank as the sea itself; that arose out of coarse feelings and blunted sensibilities, from natures that knew neither courtesy nor gentleness. \\n\\n \\n\\n Wolf Larsen did not laugh, though his gray eyes lighted with a slight glint of amusement; and in that moment, having stepped forward quite close to him, I received my first impression of the man himself- of the man as apart from his body and from the torrent of blasphemy I had heard. The face, with large features and strong lines, of the square order, yet well filled out, was apparently massive at first sight; but again, as with the body, the massiveness seemed to vanish and a conviction to grow of a tremendous and excessive mental or spiritual strength that lay behind, sleeping, in the deeps of his being. The jaw, the chin, the brow rising to a goodly height and swelling heavily above the eyes- these, while strong in themselves, unusually strong, seemed to speak an immense vigor or virility of spirit that lay behind and beyond and out of sight. There was no sounding such a spirit, no measuring, no determining of metes and bounds, or neatly classifying in some pigeonhole with others of similar type. \\n\\n \\n\\n The eyes- and it was my destiny to know them well- were large and handsome, wide apart, as the true artist\u0027s are wide, sheltering under a heavy brow and arched over by thick black eyebrows. The eyes themselves were of that baffling protean gray which is never twice the same; which runs through many shades and colorings like intershot silk in sunshine; which is gray, dark and light, and greenish gray, and sometimes of the clear azure of the deep sea. They were eyes that masked the soul with a thousand guises, and that sometimes opened, at rare moments, and allowed it to rush up as though it were about to fare forth nakedly into the world on some wonderful adventure- eyes that could brood with the hopeless somberness of leaden skies; that could snap and crackle points of fire like those that sparkle from a whirling sword; that could grow chill as an arctic landscape, and yet again, that could warm and soften and be all adance with love-lights, intense and masculine, luring and compelling, which at the same time fascinate and dominate women till they surrender in a gladness of joy and of relief and sacrifice. \\n\\n \\n\\n But to return. I told him that, unhappily for the burial service, I was not a preacher, when he sharply demanded: \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027What do you do for a living?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n I confess I had never had such a question asked me before, nor had I ever canvassed it. I was quite taken aback, and, before I could find myself, had sillily stammered: \u0027I am a gentleman.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n His lip curled in a swift sneer. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I have worked, I do work,\u0027 I cried impetuously, as though he were my judge and I required vindication, and at the same time very much aware of my arrant idiocy in discussing the subject at all. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027For your living?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n There was something so imperative and masterful about him that I was quite beside myself- \u0027rattled,\u0027 as Furuseth would have termed it, like a quaking child before a stern schoolmaster. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Who feeds you?\u0027 was his next question. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I have an income,\u0027 I answered stoutly, and could have bitten my tongue the next instant. \u0027All of which, you will pardon my observing, has nothing whatsoever to do with what I wish to see you about.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n But he disregarded my protest. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Who earned it? Eh? I thought so. Your father. You stand on dead men\u0027s legs. You\u0027ve never had any of your own. You couldn\u0027t walk alone between two sunrises and hustle the meat for your belly for three meals. Let me see your hand.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n His tremendous, dormant strength must have stirred swiftly and accurately, or I must have slept a moment, for before I knew it he had stepped two paces forward, gripped my right hand in his, and held it up for inspection. I tried to withdraw it, but his fingers tightened, without visible effort, till I thought mine would be crushed. It is hard to maintain one\u0027s dignity under such circumstances. I could not squirm or struggle like a schoolboy. Nor could I attack such a creature, who had but to twist my arm to break it. Nothing remained but to stand still and accept the indignity. I had time to notice that the pockets of the dead man had been emptied on the deck and that his body and his grin had been wrapped from view in canvas, the folds of which the sailor Johansen was sewing together with coarse white twine, shoving the needle through with a leather contrivance fitted on the palm of his hand. \\n\\n \\n\\n Wolf Larsen dropped my hand with a flirt of disdain. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Dead men\u0027s hands have kept it soft. Good for little else than dishwashing and scullion-work.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I wish to be put ashore,\u0027 I said firmly, for I now had myself in control. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I shall pay you whatever you judge your delay and trouble to be worth.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n He looked at me curiously. Mockery shone in his eyes. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I have a counter-proposition to make, and for the good of your soul. My mate\u0027s gone, and there\u0027ll be a lot of promotion. A sailor comes aft to take mate\u0027s place, cabin-boy goes for\u0027ard to take sailor\u0027s place, and you take the cabin-boy\u0027s place, sign the articles for the cruise, twenty dollars per month and found. Now, what do you say? And mind you, it\u0027s for your own soul\u0027s sake. It will be the making of you. You might learn in time to stand on your own legs and perhaps to toddle along a bit.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n But I took no notice. The sails of the vessel I had seen off to the southwest had grown larger and plainer. They were of the same rig as the Ghost\u0027s, though the hull itself, I could see, was smaller. She was a pretty sight, leaping and flying toward us, and evidently bound to pass at close range. The wind had been momentarily increasing, and the sun, after a few angry gleams, had disappeared. The sea had turned a dull leaden gray and grown rougher, and was now tossing foaming whitecaps to the sky. We were traveling faster and heeled farther over. Once, in a gust, the rail dipped under the sea, and the decks on that side were for the moment awash with water that made a couple of the hunters hastily lift their feet. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027That vessel will soon be passing us,\u0027 I said, after a moment\u0027s pause. \u0027As she is going in the opposite direction, she is very probably bound for San Francisco.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Very probably,\u0027 was Wolf Larsen\u0027s answer, as he turned partly away from me and cried out, \u0027Cooky! Oh, Cooky!\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n The Cockney popped out of the galley. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Where\u0027s that boy? Tell him I want him.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Yes, sir,\u0027 and Thomas Mugridge fled swiftly aft and disappeared down another companionway near the wheel. A moment later he emerged, a heavy-set young fellow of eighteen or nineteen, with a glowering, villainous countenance, trailing at his heels. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027\u0027Ere \u0027e, is, sir,\u0027 the cook said. \\n\\n \\n\\n But Wolf Larsen ignored that worthy, turning at once to the cabin-boy. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s your name, boy?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027George Leach, sir,\u0027 came the sullen answer, and the boy\u0027s bearing showed clearly that he divined the reason for which he had been summoned. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Not an Irish name,\u0027 the captain snapped sharply. \u0027O\u0027Toole or McCarthy would suit your mug a-sight better. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027But let that go,\u0027 he continued. \u0027You may have very good reasons for forgetting your name, and I\u0027ll like you none the worse for it as long as you toe the mark. Telegraph Hill, of course, is your port of entry. It sticks out all over your mug. Tough as they make them and twice as nasty. I know the kind. Well, you can make up your mind to have it taken out of you on this craft. Understand? Who shipped you, anyway?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027McCready \u0026 Swanson.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Sir!\u0027 Wolf Larsen thundered. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027McCready \u0026 Swanson, sir,\u0027 the boy corrected, his eyes burning with a bitter light. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Who got the advance money?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027They did, sir.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I thought as much. And devilish glad you were to let them have it. Couldn\u0027t make yourself scarce too quick, with several gentlemen you may have heard of looking for you.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n The boy metamorphosed into a savage on the instant. His body bunched together as though for a spring, and his face became as an infuriated beast\u0027s as he snarled, \u0027It\u0027s a-\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027A what?\u0027 Wolf Larsen asked, a peculiar softness in his voice, as though he were overwhelmingly curious to hear the unspoken word. \\n\\n \\n\\n The boy hesitated, then mastered his temper. \u0027Nothin\u0027, sir. I take it back.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027And you have shown me I was right.\u0027 This with a gratified smile. \u0027How old are you?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Just turned sixteen, sir.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027A lie. You\u0027ll never see eighteen again. Big for your age at that, with muscles like a horse. Pack up your kit and go for\u0027ard into the fo\u0027c\u0027s\u0027le. You\u0027re a boat-puller now. You\u0027re promoted; see?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n Without waiting for the boy\u0027s acceptance, the captain turned to the sailor who had just finished the gruesome task of sewing up the body. \u0027Johansen, do you know anything about navigation?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027No, sir.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Well, never mind; you\u0027re mate just the same. Get your traps aft into the mate\u0027s berth.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Aye, aye, sir,\u0027 was the cheery response, as Johansen started forward. \\n\\n \\n\\n In the meantime the erstwhile cabin-boy had not moved. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027What are you waiting for?\u0027 Wolf Larsen demanded. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I didn\u0027t sign for boat-puller, sir,\u0027 was the reply. \u0027I signed for cabin-boy. An\u0027 I don\u0027t want no boat-pullin\u0027 in mine.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Pack up and go for\u0027ard.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n This time Wolf Larsen\u0027s command was thrillingly imperative. The boy glowered sullenly, but refused to move. \\n\\n \\n\\n Then came another vague stirring of Wolf Larsen\u0027s tremendous strength. It was utterly unexpected, and it was over and done with between the ticks of two seconds. He had sprung fully six feet across the deck and driven his fist into the other\u0027s stomach. At the same moment, as though I had been struck myself, I felt a sickening shock in the pit of my stomach. I instance this to show the sensitiveness of my nervous organization at the time and how unused I was to spectacles of brutality. The cabin-boy- and he weighed one hundred and sixty-five at the very least- crumpled up. His body wrapped limply about the fist like a wet rag about a stick. He lifted into the air, described a short curve, and struck the deck on his head and shoulders, where he lay and writhed about in agony. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Well?\u0027 Larsen asked of me. \u0027Have you made up your mind?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n I had glanced occasionally at the approaching schooner, and it was now almost abreast of us and not more than a couple of hundred yards away. It was a very trim and neat little craft. I could see a large black number on one of its sails, and I had seen pictures of pilot-boats. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027What vessel is that?\u0027 I asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027The pilot-boat Lady Mine,\u0027 Wolf Larsen answered grimly. \u0027Got rid of her pilots and running into San Francisco. She\u0027ll be there in five or six hours with this wind.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Will you please signal it, then, so that I may be put ashore?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Sorry, but I\u0027ve lost the signal-book overboard,\u0027 he remarked, and the group of hunters grinned. \\n\\n \\n\\n I debated a moment, looking him squarely in the eyes. I had seen the frightful treatment of the cabin-boy, and knew that I should very probably receive the same, if not worse. As I say, I debated with myself, and then I did what I consider the bravest act of my life. I ran to the side, waving my arms and shouting: \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Lady Mine, ahoy! Take me ashore! A thousand dollars if you take me ashore!\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n I waited, watching two men who stood by the wheel, one of them steering. The other was lifting a megaphone to his lips. I did not turn my head, though I expected every moment a killing blow from the human brute behind me. At last, after what seemed centuries, unable longer to stand the strain, I looked around. He had not moved. He was standing in the same position, swaying easily to the roll of the ship and lighting a fresh cigar. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027What is the matter? Anything wrong?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n This was the cry from the Lady Mine. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Yes!\u0027 I shouted at the top of my lungs. \u0027Life or death! One thousand dollars if you take me ashore!\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Too much \u0027Frisco tanglefoot for the health of my crew!\u0027 Wolf Larsen shouted after. \u0027This one\u0027- indicating me with his thumb- \u0027fancies sea-serpents and monkeys just now.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n The man on the Lady Mine laughed back through the megaphone. The pilot-boat plunged past. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Give him- for me!\u0027 came a final cry, and the two men waved their arms in farewell. \\n\\n \\n\\n I leaned despairingly over the rail, watching the trim little schooner swiftly increasing the bleak sweep of ocean between us. And she would probably be in San Francisco in five or six hours! My head seemed bursting. There was an ache in my throat as though my heart were up in it. A curling wave struck the side and splashed salt spray on my lips. The wind puffed strongly, and the Ghost heeled far over, burying her lee rail. I could hear the water rushing down upon the deck. \\n\\n \\n\\n When I turned around, a moment later, I saw the cabin-boy staggering to his feet. His face was ghastly white, twitching with suppressed pain. He looked very sick. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Well, Leach, are you going for\u0027ard?\u0027 Wolf Larsen asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Yes, sir,\u0027 came the answer of a spirit cowed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027And you?\u0027 I was asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll give you a thousand-\u0027 I began, but was interrupted. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Stow that! Are you going to take up your duties as cabin-boy? Or do I have to take you in hand?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n What was I to do? To be brutally beaten, to be killed perhaps, would not help my case. I looked steadily into the cruel gray eyes. They might have been granite for all the light and warmth of a human soul they contained. One may see the soul stir in some men\u0027s eyes, but his were bleak and cold and gray as the sea itself. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Well?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 I said. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Say \"Yes, sir.\"\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Yes, sir,\u0027 I corrected. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027What is your name?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Van Weyden, sir.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027First name?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Humphrey, sir- Humphrey Van Weyden.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Age?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Thirty-five, sir.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027That\u0027ll do. Go to the cook and learn your duties.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n And thus it was that I passed into a state of involuntary servitude to Wolf Larsen. He was stronger than I, that was all. But it was very unreal at the time. It is no less unreal now that I look back upon it. It will always be to me as a monstrous, inconceivable thing, a horrible nightmare. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Hold on; don\u0027t go yet.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n I stopped obediently in my walk toward the galley. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Johansen, call all hands. Now that we\u0027ve everything cleaned up, we\u0027ll have the funeral and get the decks cleared of useless lumber.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n While Johansen was summoning the watch below, a couple of sailors, under the captain\u0027s direction, laid the canvas-swathed corpse upon a hatchcover. On each side the deck, against the rail, and bottoms up, were lashed a number of small boats. Several men picked up the hatch-cover with its ghastly freight, carried it to the lee side, and rested it on the boats, the feet pointing overboard. To the feet was attached the sack of coal which the cook had fetched. \\n\\n \\n\\n I had always conceived a burial at sea to be a very solemn and awe-inspiring event, but I was quickly disillusioned, by this burial at any rate. One of the hunters, a little dark-eyed man whom his mates called \u0027Smoke,\u0027 was telling stories liberally intersprinkled with oaths and obscenities; and every minute or so the group of hunters gave mouth to a laughter that sounded to me like a chorus of wolves. The sailors trooped noisily aft, some of the watch below running the sleep from their eyes, and talked in low tones together. There was an ominous and worried expression on their faces. It was evident that they did not like the outlook of a voyage under such a captain and begun so inauspiciously. From time to time they stole glances at Wolf Larsen, and I could see that they were apprehensive of the man. \\n\\n \\n\\n He stepped up to the hatch-cover, and all caps came off. I ran my eyes over them- twenty men all told, twenty-two, including the man at the wheel and myself. I was pardonably curious in my survey, for it appeared my fate to be pent up with them on this miniature floating world for I knew not how many weeks or months. The sailors, in the main, were English and Scandinavian, and their faces seemed of the heavy, stolid order. The hunters, on the other hand, had stronger and more diversified faces, with hard lines and the marks of the free play of passions. Strange to say, and I noted it at once, Wolf Larsen\u0027s features showed no such evil stamp. There seemed nothing vicious in them. True, there were lines, but they were the lines of decision and firmness. It seemed, rather, a frank and open countenance, which frankness or openness was enhanced by the fact that he was smooth-shaven. I could hardly believe, until the next incident occurred, that it was the face of a man who could behave as he had behaved to the cabin-boy. \\n\\n \\n\\n At this moment, as he opened his mouth to speak, puff after puff struck the schooner and pressed her side under. The wind shrieked a wild song through the rigging. Some of the hunters glanced anxiously aloft. The whole lee rail, where the dead man lay, was buried in the sea, and as the schooner lifted and righted, the water swept across the deck, wetting us above our shoe-tops. A shower of rain drove down upon us, each drop stinging like a hailstone. As it passed, Wolf Larsen began to speak, the bareheaded men swaying in unison to the heave and lunge of the deck. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027I only remember one part of the service,\u0027 he said, \u0027and that is, \"And the body shall be cast into the sea.\" So cast it in.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n He ceased speaking. The men holding the hatch-cover seemed perplexed, puzzled no doubt by the briefness of the ceremony. He burst upon them in a fury. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Lift up that end there! What the - \u0027s the matter with you?\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n They elevated the end of the hatch-cover with pitiful haste, and, like a dog flung overside, the dead man slid feet first into the sea. The coal at his feet dragged him down. He was gone. \\n\\n \\n\\n \u0027Johansen,\u0027 Wolf Larsen said briskly to the new mate, \u0027keep all hands on deck now they\u0027re here. Get in the topsails and outer jibs. We\u0027re in for a sou\u0027easter. Reef the jib and the mainsail, too, while you\u0027re about it.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n In a moment the decks were in commotion, Johansen bellowing orders and the men pulling or letting go ropes of various sorts- all naturally confusing to a landsman such as myself. But it was the heartlessness of it that especially struck me. The dead man was an episode that was past, an incident that was dropped, in a canvas covering with a sack of coal, while the ship sped along and her work went on. Nobody had been affected. The hunters were laughing at a fresh story of Smoke\u0027s; the men pulling and hauling, and two of them climbing aloft; Wolf Larsen was studying the clouding sky to windward; and the dead man, buried sordidly, and sinking down, down- \\n\\n \\n\\n Then it was that the cruelty of the sea, its relentlessness and awfulness, rushed upon me. Life had become cheap and tawdry, a beastly and inarticulate thing, a soulless stirring of the ooze and slime. I held onto the weather rail, close by the shrouds, and gazed out across the desolate foaming waves to the low-lying fog-banks that hid San Francisco and the California coast. Rain-squalls were driving in between, and I could scarcely see the fog. And this strange vessel, with its terrible men, pressed under by wind and sea and ever leaping up and out, as for very life, was heading away into the southwest, into the great and lonely Pacific expanse. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/94/4914.html","bookId":293,"book":{"id":293,"title":"The Sea-Wolf海狼","description":"简介： The Sea-Wolf is a 1904 psychological adventure novel by American novelist Jack London about a literary critic and other survivors of an ocean collision who come under the dominance of Wolf Larsen, the powerful and amoral sea captain who rescues ...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1289609238bf31c.jpg","type":"Inspirational","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/94","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:30 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:30 AM"}}
