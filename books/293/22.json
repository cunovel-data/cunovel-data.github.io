{"id":20819,"no":22,"title":"Chapter 22","content":"I KNEW WHAT IT WAS AS SHE came toward me. For ten minutes I had watched her talking earnestly with the engineer, and now, with a sign for silence, I drew her out of earshot of the helmsman. Her face was white and set; her large eyes- larger than usual, what of the purpose in them- looked penetratingly into mine. I felt rather timid and apprehensive, for she had come to search Humphrey Van Weyden\u0027s soul, and Humphrey Van Weyden had nothing of which to be particularly proud since his advent on the Ghost. We walked to the break of the poop, where she turned and faced me. I glanced around to see that no one was within hearing distance. \u0027What is it?\u0027 I asked gently; but the expression of grim determination on her face did not relax. \u0027I can readily understand,\u0027 she began, \u0027that this morning\u0027s affair was largely an accident; but I have been talking with Mr. Haskins. He tells me that the day we were rescued, even while I was in the cabin, two men were drowned, deliberately drowned- murdered.\u0027 There was a query in her voice, and she faced me accusingly, as though I were guilty of the deed, or at least a party to it. \u0027The information is quite correct,\u0027 I answered. \u0027The two men were murdered.\u0027 \u0027And you permitted it!\u0027 she cried. \u0027I was unable to prevent it, is a better way of phrasing it,\u0027 I replied, still gently. \u0027But you tried to prevent it?\u0027 There was an emphasis on the \u0027tried,\u0027 and a pleading little note in her voice. \u0027Oh, but you didn\u0027t!\u0027 she hurried on, divining my answer. \u0027But why didn\u0027t you?\u0027 I shrugged my shoulders. \u0027You must remember, Miss Brewster, that you are a new inhabitant of this little world, and that you do not yet understand the laws which operate within it. You bring with you certain fine conceptions of humanity, manhood, conduct, and such things; but here you will find them misconceptions. I have found it so,\u0027 I added, with an involuntary sigh. She shook her head incredulously. \u0027What would you advise, then?\u0027 I asked. \u0027That I should take a knife, or a gun, or an ax, and kill this man?\u0027 She started back. \u0027No, not that!\u0027 \u0027Then what should I do? Kill myself?\u0027 \u0027You speak in purely materialistic terms,\u0027 she objected. \u0027There is such a thing as moral courage, and moral courage is never without effect.\u0027 \u0027Ah,\u0027 I smiled, \u0027you advise me to kill neither him nor myself, but to let him kill me.\u0027 I held up my hand as she was about to speak. \u0027For moral courage is a worthless asset on this little floating world. Leach, one of the men who were murdered, had moral courage to an unusual degree. So had the other man, Johnson. Not only did it not stand them in good stead, but it destroyed them. And so with me, if I should exercise what little moral courage I may possess. You must understand, Miss Brewster, and understand clearly, that this man is a monster. He is without conscience. Nothing is sacred to him, nothing is too terrible for him to do. It was due to his whim that I was detained aboard in the first place. It is due to his whim that I am still alive. I do nothing, can do nothing, because I am a slave to this monster, as you are now a slave to him; because I desire to live, as you will desire to live; because I cannot fight and overcome him, just as you will not be able to fight and overcome him.\u0027 She waited for me to go on. \u0027What remains? Mine is the role of the weak. I remain silent and suffer ignominy as you will remain silent and suffer ignominy. And it is well. It is the best we can do if we wish to live. The battle is not always to the strong. We have not the strength with which to fight this man; we must dissimulate, and win, if win we can, by craft. If you will be advised by me, this is what you will do. I know my position is perilous, and I may say frankly that yours is even more perilous. We must stand together, without appearing to do so, in secret alliance. I shall not be able to side with you openly, and, no matter what indignities may be put upon me, you are to remain likewise silent. We must provoke no scenes with this man, or cross his will. And we must keep smiling faces and be friendly with him, no matter how repulsive it may be.\u0027 She brushed her hand across her forehead in a puzzled way, saying, \u0027Still, I do not understand.\u0027 \u0027You must do as I say,\u0027 I interrupted authoritatively, for I saw Wolf Larsen\u0027s gaze wandering toward us from where he paced up and down with Latimer amidships. \u0027Do as I say, and before long you will find I am right.\u0027 \u0027What shall I do, then?\u0027 she asked, detecting the anxious glance I had shot at the object of our conversation, and impressed, I flatter myself with the earnestness of my manner. \u0027Dispense with all the moral courage you can,\u0027 I said briskly. \u0027Don\u0027t arouse this man\u0027s animosity. Be quite friendly with him, talk with him, discuss literature and art with him- he is fond of such things. You will find him an interested listener and no fool. And for your own sake try to avoid witnessing, as much as you can, the brutalities of the ship. It will make it easier for you to act your part.\u0027 \u0027I am to lie,\u0027 she said in steady, rebellious tones; \u0027by speech and action to lie.\u0027 Wolf Larsen had separated from Latimer and was coming toward us. I was desperate. \u0027Please, please understand me,\u0027 I said hurriedly, lowering my voice. \u0027All your experience of men and things is worthless here. You must begin over again. I know- I can see it- you have, among other ways, been used to managing people with your eyes, letting your moral courage speak out through them, as it were. You have already managed me with your eyes, commanded me with them. But don\u0027t try it on Wolf Larsen. You could as easily control a lion, while he would make a mock of you. He would-\u0027 \u0027I have always been proud of the fact that I discovered him,\u0027 I said, turning the conversation as Wolf Larsen stepped on the poop and joined us. \u0027The editors were afraid of him, and the publishers would have none of him. But I knew, and his genius and my judgment were vindicated when he made that magnificent hit with his \"Plowman.\" \u0027And it was a newspaper poem,\u0027 she said glibly. \u0027It did happen to see the light in a newspaper,\u0027 I replied, \u0027but not because the magazine editors had been denied a glimpse at it. \u0027We were talking of Harris,\u0027 I said to Wolf Larsen. \u0027Oh, yes,\u0027 he acknowledged. \u0027I remember \"The Ring.\" Filled with pretty sentiments and an almighty faith in human illusions. By the way, Mr. Van Weyden, you\u0027d better look in on Cooky. He\u0027s complaining and restless.\u0027 Thus was I bluntly dismissed from the poop, only to find Mugridge sleeping soundly from the morphine I had given him. I made no haste to return on deck, and when I did, I was gratified to see Miss Brewster in animated conversation with Wolf Larsen. As I say, the sight gratified me. She was following my advice. And yet I was conscious of a slight shock or hurt in that she was able to do the thing I had begged her to do, and which she had notably disliked.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/94/4933.html","bookId":293,"book":{"id":293,"title":"The Sea-Wolf海狼","description":"简介： The Sea-Wolf is a 1904 psychological adventure novel by American novelist Jack London about a literary critic and other survivors of an ocean collision who come under the dominance of Wolf Larsen, the powerful and amoral sea captain who rescues ...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1289609238bf31c.jpg","type":"Inspirational","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/94","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:30 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:30 AM"}}
