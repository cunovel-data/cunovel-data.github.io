{"id":20810,"no":13,"title":"Chapter 13","content":"FOR THREE DAYS I DID MY OWN work and Thomas Mugridge\u0027s too, and I flatter myself that I did his work well. I know that it won Wolf Larsen\u0027s approval, while the sailors beamed with satisfaction during the brief time my regime lasted. \n \n \u0027The first clean bite since I come aboard Harrison said to me at the galley door, as he returned the dinner pots and pans from the forecastle. \u0027Somehow, Tommy\u0027s grub always tastes of grease,- stale grease,- and I reckon he ain\u0027t changed his shirt since he left \u0027Frisco.\u0027 \n \n \u0027I know he hasn\u0027t,\u0027 I answered. \n \n \u0027And I\u0027ll bet he sleeps in it,\u0027 Harrison added. \n \n \u0027And you won\u0027t lose,\u0027 I agreed. \u0027The same shirt, and he hasn\u0027t had it off once in all this time.\u0027 \n \n But three days were all Wolf Larsen allowed him in which to recover from the effects of the beating. On the fourth day, lame and sore, scarcely able to see, so closed were his eyes, he was haled from his bunk by the nape of the neck and set to his duty. He sniffled and wept, but Wolf Larsen was pitiless. \n \n \u0027And see that you serve no more slops,\u0027 was his parting injunction. \u0027No more grease and dirt, mind, and a clean shirt occasionally, or you\u0027ll get a tow over the side. Understand?\u0027 \n \n Thomas Mugridge crawled weakly across the galley floor, and a short lurch of the Ghost sent him staggering. In attempting to recover himself, he reached for the iron railing which surrounded the stove and kept the pots from sliding off; but his missed the railing, and his hand, with his weight behind it, landed squarely on the hot surface. \n \n \u0027Oh, Gawd, Gawd, wot \u0027ave I done?\u0027 he wailed, sitting down in the coalbox and nursing his new hurt by rocking back and forth. \u0027W\u0027y \u0027as all this come on me? It mykes me fair sick, it does, an\u0027 I try so \u0027ard to go through life harmless an\u0027 \u0027urtin\u0027 nobody.\u0027 \n \n The tears were running down his puffed and discolored cheeks, and his face was drawn with pain. A savage expression flitted across it. \n \n \u0027Oh, \u0027ow I \u0027ate \u0027im! \u0027Ow I \u0027ate \u0027im!\u0027 he gritted out. \n \n \u0027Whom?\u0027 I asked; but the poor wretch was weeping again over his misfortunes. Less difficult it was to guess whom he hated than whom he did not hate; for I had come to see a malignant devil in him which impelled him to hate all the world. I sometimes thought that he hated even himself, so grotesquely had life dealt with him, and so monstrously. At such moments a great sympathy welled up within me, and I felt shame that I had ever joyed in his discomfiture or pain. Life had been unfair to him. It had played him a scurvy trick when it fashioned him into the thing he was, and it had played him scurvy tricks ever since. What chance had he to be anything else than what he was? And as though answering my unspoken thought, he wailed: \n \n \u0027I never \u0027ad no chance, nor \u0027arf a chance! \u0027Oo was there to send me to school, or put tommy in my \u0027ungry bell w\u0027en I was a kiddy? \u0027Oo ever did anything for me, heh? \u0027oo, I s\u0027y?\u0027 \n \n \u0027Never mind, Tommy,\u0027 I said, placing a soothing hand on his shoulder. \u0027Cheer up. It\u0027ll all come right in the end. You\u0027ve long years before you, and you can make anything you please of yourself.\u0027 \n \n \u0027It\u0027s a lie!\u0027 he shouted in my face, flinging off the hand. \u0027It\u0027s a lie, an\u0027 you know it. I\u0027m already myde, an\u0027 myde out of leavin\u0027s an\u0027 scraps. It\u0027s all right for you, \u0027Ump. You was born a gentleman. You never knew wot it was to go \u0027ungry, to cry yerself asleep with a gnawin\u0027 an\u0027 gnawin\u0027, like a rat, inside yer. It carn\u0027t come right. If I was President of the United Stytes to-morrer, low would it fill my belly for one time w\u0027en I was a kiddy an\u0027 it went empty? \n \n \u0027\u0027Ow could it, I s\u0027y? I was born to sufferin\u0027 and\u0027 sorrer. I\u0027ve \u0027ad more cruel sufferin\u0027 than any ten men, I \u0027ave. I\u0027ve been in \u0027orspital \u0027arf my bleedin\u0027 life. I\u0027ve \u0027ad the fever in Aspinwall, in \u0027Avana, in New Orleans. I near died of the scurvy, an\u0027 rotten with it six months in Barbados. Smallpox in \u0027Onolulu, two broken legs in Shanghai, pneumonia in Unalaska, three busted ribs an\u0027 my insides all twisted in \u0027Frisco. An\u0027 \u0027ere I am now. Look at me! Look at me! My ribs kicked loose from my back again. I\u0027ll be coughin\u0027 blood before eyght bells. \u0027Ow can it be myde up to me, I arsk? \u0027Oo\u0027s goin\u0027 to do it? Gawd? \u0027Ow Gawd must \u0027ave \u0027ated me w\u0027en \u0027e signed me on for a voyage in this bloomin\u0027 world of \u0027is!\u0027 \n \n This tirade against destiny went on for an hour or more, and then he buckled to his work, limping and groaning, and in his eyes a great hatred for all created things. \n \n Several days more passed before Johnson crawled on deck and went about his work in a half-hearted way. He was still a sick man, and I more than once observed him creeping painfully aloft to a topsail or drooping wearily as he stood at the wheel. But, still worse, it seemed that his spirit was broken. He was abject before Wolf Larsen, and almost groveled to Johansen. Not so Leach. He went about the deck like a tiger-cub, glaring his hatred openly at Wolf Larsen and Johansen. \n \n \u0027I\u0027ll do for you yet, you slab-footed Swede.\u0027 I heard him say to Johansen one night on deck. \n \n The mate cursed him in the darkness, and the next moment some missile struck the galley a sharp rap. There was more cursing, and a mocking laugh, and when all was quiet I stole outside and found a heavy knife embedded over an inch in the solid wood. A few minutes later the mate came fumbling about in search of it, but I returned it privily to Leach next day. He grinned when I handed it over, yet it was a grin that contained more sincere thanks than a multitude of the verbosities of speech common to the members of my own class. \n \n Unlike any one else in the ship\u0027s company, I now found myself with no quarrels on my hands and in the good graces of all. The hunters possibly no more than tolerated me, though none of them disliked me; while Smoke and Henderson, convalescent under a deck awning and swinging day and night in their hammocks, assured me that I was better than any hospital nurse, and that they would not forget me at the end of the voyage when they were paid off. As though I stood in need of their money- I, who could have bought them out, bag and baggage, and the schooner and its equipment, a hundred times over! But upon me had devolved the task of tending their wounds and pulling them through, and I did my best by them. \n \n Wolf Larsen underwent another bad attack of headache, which lasted two days. He must have suffered severely, for he called me in and obeyed my commands like a sick child. But nothing I could do seemed to relieve him. At my suggestion, however, he gave up smoking and drinking, though why so magnificent an animal as he should have headaches at all puzzled me. \n \n \u0027\u0027T is the hand of God, I\u0027m tellin\u0027 you,\u0027 was the way Louis saw it. \u0027\u0027T is a visitation for his black-hearted deeds, an\u0027 there\u0027s more behind an\u0027 comin\u0027, or else-\u0027 \n \n \u0027Or else,\u0027 I prompted. \n \n \u0027God is noddin\u0027 an\u0027 not doin\u0027 his duty, though it\u0027s me as shouldn\u0027t say it.\u0027 I was mistaken when I said that I was in the good graces of all. Not only did Thomas Mugridge continue to hate me, but he had discovered a new reason for hating me. It took me no little while to puzzle it out, but I finally discovered that it was because I was more luckily born than he- \u0027gentleman born,\u0027 he put it. \n \n \u0027And still no more dead men,\u0027 I twitted Louis, when Smoke and Henderson, side by side, in friendly conversation, took their first exercise on deck. \n \n Louis surveyed me with his shrewd gray eyes and shook his head portentously. \n \n \u0027She\u0027s a-comin\u0027, I tell you, an\u0027 it\u0027ll be sheets an\u0027 halyards, stand by all hands, when she begins to howl. I\u0027ve had the feel iv it this long time, an\u0027 I can feel it now as plainly as I feel the riggin\u0027 iv a dark night. She\u0027s close, she\u0027s close.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Who goes first?\u0027 I queried. \n \n \u0027Not old fat Louis, I promise you,\u0027 he laughed. \u0027For \u0027t is in the bones iv me I know that come this time next year I\u0027ll be gazin\u0027 in the old mother\u0027s eyes, weary with watchin\u0027 iv the sea for the five sons she gave to it.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Wot\u0027s\u0027e been s\u0027yin\u0027 to yer?\u0027 Thomas Mugridge demanded a moment later. \n \n \u0027That he\u0027s going home some day to see his mother,\u0027 I answered diplomatically. \n \n \u0027I never \u0027ad none,\u0027 was the Cockney\u0027s comment, as he gazed with lusterless, hopeless eyes into mine. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/94/4924.html","bookId":293,"book":{"id":293,"title":"The Sea-Wolf海狼","description":"简介： The Sea-Wolf is a 1904 psychological adventure novel by American novelist Jack London about a literary critic and other survivors of an ocean collision who come under the dominance of Wolf Larsen, the powerful and amoral sea captain who rescues ...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1289609238bf31c.jpg","type":"Inspirational","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/94","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:30 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:30 AM"}}
