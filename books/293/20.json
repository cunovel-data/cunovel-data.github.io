{"id":20817,"no":20,"title":"Chapter 20","content":"THE REMAINDER OF THE DAY passed uneventfully. The young slip of a gale, having wetted our gills, proceeded to moderate. The fourth engineer and the three oilers, after a warm interview with Wolf Larsen, were furnished with outfits from the slop-chest, assigned places under the hunters in the various boats and watches on the vessel, and bundled forward into the forecastle. They went protestingly, but their voices were not loud. They were awed by what they had already seen of Wolf Larsen\u0027s character, while the tale of woe they speedily heard in the forecastle took the last bit of rebellion out of them. \n \n Miss Brewster- we had learned her name from the engineer- slept on and on. At supper I requested the hunters to lower their voices, so she was not disturbed; and it was not till next morning that she made her appearance. It had been my intention to have her meals served apart, but Wolf Larsen put down his foot. Who was she that she should be too good for cabin table and cabin society? had been his demand. \n \n But her coming to the table had something amusing in it. The hunters fell as silent as clams. Jock Horner and Smoke alone were unabashed, stealing stealthy glances at her now and again, and even taking part in the conversation. The other four men glued their eyes on their plates and chewed steadily and with thoughtful precision, their ears moving and wabbling, in time with their jaws, like the ears of so many animals. \n \n Wolf Larsen had little to say at first, doing no more than reply when he was addressed. Not that he was abashed. Far from it. This woman was a new type to him, a different breed from any he had ever known, and he was curious. He studied her, his eyes rarely leaving her face, unless to follow the movements of her hands or shoulders. I studied her myself, and though it was I who maintained the conversation, I know that I was a bit shy, not quite self-possessed. His was the perfect poise, the supreme confidence in self which nothing could shake; and he was no more timid of a woman than he was of storm and battle. \n \n \u0027And when shall we arrive at Yokohama?\u0027 she asked, turning to him and looking him square in the eyes. \n \n There it was, the question flat. The jaws stopped working, the ears ceased wabbling, and though eyes remained on plates, each man listened greedily for the answer. \n \n \u0027In four months, possibly three, if the season closes early,\u0027 Wolf Larsen said. She caught her breath and stammered: \n \n \u0027I- I thought- I was given to understand that Yokohama was only a day\u0027s sail away. It- \u0027 Here she paused and looked about the table at the circle of unsympathetic faces staring hard at the plates. \u0027It is not right,\u0027 she concluded. \n \n \u0027That is a question you must settle with Mr. Van Weyden there,\u0027 he replied, bowing to me with a mischievous twinkle. \u0027Mr. Van Weyden is what you may call an authority on such things as rights. Now I, who am only a sailor, would look upon the situation somewhat differently. It may possibly be your misfortune that you have to remain with us, but it is certainly our good fortune.\u0027 \n \n He regarded her smilingly. Her eyes fell before his gaze, but she lifted them again, and defiantly, to mine. I read the unspoken question there: Was it right? But I had decided that the part I was to play must be a neutral one, so I did not answer. \n \n \u0027What do you think?\u0027 she demanded. \n \n \u0027It is unfortunate,\u0027 I said, \u0027especially if you have any engagements falling due in the course of the next several months. But, since you say that you were voyaging to Japan for your health, I can assure you that it will improve no better anywhere than aboard the Ghost.\u0027 \n \n I saw her eyes flash with indignation, and this time it was I who dropped mine, while I felt my face flushing under her gaze. It was cowardly, but what else could I do? \n \n \u0027Mr. Van Weyden speaks with the voice of authority.\u0027 Wolf Larsen laughed. \n \n I nodded my head and she, having recovered herself, waited expectantly. \n \n \u0027Not that he is much to speak of now,\u0027 Wolf Larsen went on; \u0027but he has improved wonderfully. You should have seen him when he came on board. A more scrawny, pitiful specimen of humanity one could hardly conceive. Isn\u0027t that so, Kerfoot?\u0027 \n \n Kerfoot, thus directly addressed, was startled into dropping his knife on the floor, though he managed to grunt affirmation. \n \n \u0027Developed himself by peeling potatoes and washing dishes. Eh, Kerfoot?\u0027 \n \n Again that worthy grunted. \n \n \u0027Look at him now. True, he is not what you would term muscular, but still he has muscles, which is more than he had when he came aboard. Also, he has legs to stand on. You would not think so to look at him, but he was quite unable to stand alone at first.\u0027 \n \n The hunters were snickering, but she looked at me with a sympathy in her eyes which more than compensated for Wolf Larsen\u0027s nastiness. In truth, it had been so long since I had received sympathy that I was softened, and I became then, and gladly, her willing slave. But I was angry with Wolf Larsen. He was challenging my manhood with his slurs, challenging the very legs he claimed to be instrumental in getting for me. \n \n \u0027I may have learned to stand on my own legs,\u0027 I retorted. \u0027But I have yet to stamp upon others with them.\u0027 \n \n He looked at me insolently. \u0027Your education is only half completed, then,\u0027 he said dryly, and turned to her. \u0027We are very hospitable upon the Ghost. Mr. Van Weyden has discovered that. We do everything to make our guests feel at home, eh, Mr. Van Weyden?\u0027 \n \n \u0027Even to the peeling of potatoes and the washing of dishes,\u0027 I answered, \u0027to say nothing of wringing their necks, out of very fellowship.\u0027 \n \n \u0027I beg of you not to receive false impressions of us from Mr. Van Weyden,\u0027 he interposed with mock anxiety. \u0027You will observe, Miss Brewster, that he carries a dirk in his belt, a- ahem- a most unusual thing for a ship\u0027s officer to do. While really very estimable, Mr. Van Weyden is sometimes- how shall I say?- er- quarrelsome, and harsh measures are necessary. He is quite reasonable and fair in his calm moments, and as he is calm now, he will not deny that only yesterday he threatened my life.\u0027 \n \n I was well-nigh choking, and my eyes were certainly fiery. He drew attention to me. \n \n \u0027Look at him now. He can scarcely control himself in your presence. He is not accustomed to the presence of ladies, anyway. I shall have to arm myself before I dare go on deck with him.\u0027 \n \n He shook his head sadly, murmuring, \u0027Too bad, too bad,\u0027 while the hunters burst into guffaws of laughter. \n \n The deep sea-voices of these men, rumbling and bellowing in the confined space, produced a wild effect. The whole setting was wild, and for the first time, regarding this strange woman and realizing how incongruous she was in it, I was aware of how much a part of it I was myself. I knew these men and their mental processes, was one of them myself, living the seal-hunting life, eating the seal-hunting fare, thinking largely the seal-hunting thoughts. There was no strangeness to it, to the rough clothes, the coarse faces, the wild laughter, and the lurching cabin walls and swaying sea-lamps. \n \n As I buttered a piece of bread and my eyes chanced to rest upon my hand. The knuckles were skinned and inflamed clear across, the fingers swollen, the nails rimmed with black. I felt the mattress-like growth of beard on my neck, knew that the sleeve of my coat was ripped, that a button was missing from the throat of the blue shirt I wore. The dirk mentioned by Wolf Larsen rested in its sheath on my hip. It was very natural that it should be there- how natural I had not imagined until now, when I looked upon it with her eyes and knew how strange it and all that went with it must appear to her. \n \n But she divined the mockery in Wolf Larsen\u0027s words, and again favored me with a sympathetic glance. But there was a look of bewilderment also in her eyes. That it was mockery made the situation more puzzling to her. \n \n \u0027I may be taken off by some passing vessel, perhaps,\u0027 she suggested. \n \n \u0027There will be no passing vessels, except other sealing-schooners,\u0027 Wolf Larsen made answer. \n \n \u0027I have no clothes, nothing,\u0027 she objected. \u0027You hardly realize, sir, that I am not a man, or that I am unaccustomed to the vagrant, careless life which you and your men seem to lead.\u0027 \n \n \u0027The sooner you get accustomed to it the better,\u0027 he said. \u0027I\u0027ll furnish you with cloth, needles, and thread,\u0027 he added. \u0027I hope it will not be too dreadful a hardship for you to make yourself a dress or two.\u0027 \n \n She made a wry pucker with her mouth, as though to advertise her ignorance of dressmaking. That she was frightened and bewildered, and that she was bravely striving to hide it, was quite plain to me. \n \n \u0027I suppose you\u0027re like Mr. Van Weyden there, accustomed to having things done for you. Well, I think doing a few things for yourself will hardly dislocate any joints. By the way, what do you for a living?\u0027 \n \n She regarded him with amazement unconcealed. \n \n \u0027I mean no offense, believe me. People eat, therefore they must procure the wherewithal. These men here shoot seals in order to live; for the same reason I sail this schooner; and Mr. Van Weyden, for the present at any rate, earns his salty grub by assisting me. Now what do you do?\u0027 \n \n She shrugged her shoulders. \n \n \u0027Do you feed yourself, or does some one else feed you?\u0027 \n \n \u0027I\u0027m afraid some one else has fed me most of my life,\u0027 she laughed, trying bravely to enter into the spirit of his quizzing, though I could see a terror dawning and growing in her eyes as she watched Wolf Larsen. \n \n \u0027And I suppose some one else makes your bed for you?\u0027 \n \n \u0027I have made beds,\u0027 she replied. \n \n \u0027Very often?\u0027 \n \n She shook her head with mock ruefulness. \n \n \u0027Do you know what they do to poor men in the States who, like you, do not work for their living?\u0027 \n \n \u0027I am very ignorant,\u0027 she pleaded. \u0027What do they do to the poor men who are like me?\u0027 \n \n \u0027They send them to jail. The crime of not earning a living, in their case, is called vagrancy. If I were Mr. Van Weyden, who harps eternally on questions of right and wrong, I\u0027d ask, By what right do you live when you do nothing to deserve living?\u0027 \n \n \u0027But as you are not Mr. Van Weyden, I don\u0027t have to answer, do I?\u0027 \n \n She beamed upon him through her terror-filled eyes, and the pathos of it cut me to the heart. I felt that I must in some way break in and lead the conversation into other channels. \n \n \u0027Have you ever earned a dollar by your own labor?\u0027 he demanded, certain of her answer, a triumphant vindictiveness in his voice. \n \n \u0027Yes, I have,\u0027 she answered slowly, and I could have laughed aloud at his crestfallen visage. \u0027I remember my father giving me a dollar once, when I was a little girl, for remaining absolutely quiet for five minutes.\u0027 \n \n He smiled indulgently. \n \n \u0027But that was long ago,\u0027 she continued. \u0027And you would scarcely demand a little girl of nine to earn her own living. At present, however,\u0027 she said, after another slight pause, \u0027I earn about eighteen hundred dollars a year.\u0027 \n \n With one accord all eyes left the plates and settled on her. A woman who earned eighteen hundred dollars a year was worth looking at. Wolf Larsen was undisguised in his admiration. \n \n \u0027Salary or piece-work?\u0027 he asked. \n \n \u0027Piece-work,\u0027 she answered promptly. \n \n \u0027Eighteen hundred,\u0027 he calculated. \u0027That\u0027s a hundred and fifty dollars a month. Well, Miss Brewster, there is nothing small about the Ghost. Consider yourself on salary during the time you remain with us.\u0027 \n \n She made no acknowledgment. She was too unused as yet to the whims of the man to accept them with equanimity. \n \n \u0027I forgot to inquire,\u0027 he went on suavely, \u0027as to the nature of your occupation. What commodities do you turn out? What tools and materials do you require?\u0027 \n \n \u0027Paper and ink,\u0027 she laughed. \u0027And, oh! also a typewriter.\u0027 \n \n \u0027You are Maud Brewster,\u0027 I said slowly and with certainty, almost as though I were charging her with a crime. \n \n Her eyes lifted curiously to mine. \n \n \u0027How do you know?\u0027 \n \n \u0027Aren\u0027t you?\u0027 I demanded. \n \n She acknowledged her identity with a nod. It was Wolf Larsen\u0027s turn to be puzzled. The name and its magic signified nothing to him. I was proud that it did mean something to me, and for the first time in a weary while I was convincingly conscious of a superiority over him. \n \n \u0027I remember writing a review of a thin little volume-\u0027 I had begun carelessly, when she interrupted me. \n \n \u0027You!\u0027 she cried. \u0027You are-\u0027 \n \n She was now staring at me in wide-eyed wonder. \n \n I nodded my identity, in turn. \n \n \u0027Humphrey Van Weyden,\u0027 she concluded; then added, with a sigh of relief and unaware that she had glanced that relief at Wolf Larsen, \u0027I am so glad.\u0027 \n \n \u0027I remember the review,\u0027 she went on hastily, becoming aware of the awkwardness of her remark, \u0027that too, too flattering review.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Not at all,\u0027 I denied valiantly. \u0027You impeach my sober judgment and make my canons of little worth, Besides, all my brother critics were with me.\u0027 \n \n \u0027You are very kind, I am sure, she murmured; and the very conventionality of her tones and words, with the host of associations it aroused of the old life on the other side of the world, gave me a quick thrill- rich with rememberance but stinging sharp with homesickness. \n \n \u0027And you are Maud Brewster,\u0027 I said solemnly, gazing across at her. \n \n \u0027And you are Humphrey Van Weyden,\u0027 she said, gazing back at me with equal solemnity and awe. \u0027How unusual! I don\u0027t understand. We surely are not to expect some wildly romantic sea-story from your sober pen.\u0027 \n \n \u0027No, I am not gathering material, I assure you,\u0027 was my answer. \u0027I have neither aptitude nor inclination for fiction.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Tell me, why have you always buried yourself in California?\u0027 she next asked. \u0027It has not been kind of you. We of the East have seen so very little of you- too little indeed of the Dean of American Letters the Second.\u0027 \n \n I bowed to, and disclaimed, the compliment. \n \n \u0027I nearly met you, once, in Philadelphia, some Browning affair or other- you were to lecture, you know. My train was four hours late.\u0027 \n \n And then we quite forgot where we were, leaving Wolf Larsen stranded and silent in the midst of our flood of gossip. The hunters left the table and went on deck, and still we talked. Wolf Larsen alone remained. Suddenly I became aware of him, leaning back from the table and listening curiously to our alien speech of a world he did not know. \n \n I broke short off in the middle of a sentence. The present, with all its perils and anxieties, rushed upon me with stunning force. It smote Miss Brewster likewise, a vague and nameless terror rushing into her eyes as she regarded Wolf Larsen. \n \n He rose to his feet and laughed awkwardly. The sound of it was metallic. \n \n \u0027Oh, don\u0027t mind me,\u0027 he said, with a self-depreciatory wave of his hand. \n \n \u0027I don\u0027t count. Go on, go on, I pray you.\u0027 \n \n But the gates of speech were closed, and we, too, rose from the table and laughed awkwardly. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/94/4931.html","bookId":293,"book":{"id":293,"title":"The Sea-Wolf海狼","description":"简介： The Sea-Wolf is a 1904 psychological adventure novel by American novelist Jack London about a literary critic and other survivors of an ocean collision who come under the dominance of Wolf Larsen, the powerful and amoral sea captain who rescues ...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1289609238bf31c.jpg","type":"Inspirational","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/94","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:30 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:30 AM"}}
