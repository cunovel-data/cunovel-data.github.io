{"id":20831,"no":34,"title":"Chapter 34","content":"\u0027IT\u0027S TOO BAD THE GHOST HAS LOST her masts. Why, we could sail away in her. Don\u0027t you think we could, Humphrey?\u0027 \n \n I sprang excitedly to my feet. \n \n \u0027I wonder- I wonder,\u0027 I repeated, pacing up and down. \n \n Maud\u0027s eyes were shining with anticipation as they followed me. She had such faith in me! And the thought of it was so much added power. I remembered Michelet\u0027s: \u0027To man, woman is as the earth was to her legendary son; he has but to fall down and kiss her breast and he is strong again.\u0027 For the first time I knew the wonderful truth of his words. Why, I was living them. Maud was all this to me, an unfailing source of strength and courage. I had but to look at her, or think of her, and be strong again. \n \n \u0027It can be done- it can be done,\u0027 I was thinking and asserting aloud. \u0027What men have done I can do, and if they have never done this before, still I can do it.\u0027 \n \n \u0027What, for goodness\u0027 sake?\u0027 Maud demanded. \u0027Do be merciful. What is it you can do?\u0027 \n \n \u0027We can do it,\u0027 I amended. \u0027Why, nothing else than put the masts back into the Ghost and sail away.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Humphrey!\u0027 she exclaimed. \n \n And I felt as proud of my conception as if it were already a fact accomplished. \n \n \u0027But how is it possibly to be done?\u0027 she asked. \n \n \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 was my answer. \u0027I know only that I am capable of doing anything these days.\u0027 \n \n I smiled proudly at her- too proudly, for she dropped her eyes and was for the moment silent. \n \n \u0027But there is Captain Larsen,\u0027 she objected. \n \n \u0027Blind and helpless,\u0027 I answered promptly, waving him aside as a straw. \n \n \u0027But those terrible hands of his! You know how he leaped across the opening of the lazaret.\u0027 \n \n \u0027And you know also how I crept about and avoided him,\u0027 I contended gaily. \n \n \u0027And lost your shoes.\u0027 \n \n \u0027You\u0027d hardly expect him to avoid Wolf Larsen without my feet inside of them.\u0027 \n \n We both laughed, and then went seriously to work constructing the plan whereby we were to step the masts of the Ghost and return to the world. I remembered hazily the physics of my schooldays, while the last few months had given me practical experience with mechanical purchases. I must say, though, when we walked down to the Ghost to inspect more closely the task before us, that the sight of the great masts lying in the water almost disheartened me. Where were we to begin? If there had been one mast standing, something high up to which to fasten blocks and tackles! But there was nothing. It reminded me of the problem of lifting oneself by one\u0027s bootstraps. I understood the mechanics of levers; but where was I to get a fulcrum? \n \n There was the mainmast, fifteen inches in diameter at what was now the butt, still sixty-five feet in length, and weighing, I roughly calculated, at least three thousand pounds. And then came the foremast, larger in diameter and weighing surely thirty-five hundred pounds. Where was I to begin? Maud stood silently by my side while I evolved in my mind the contrivance known among sailors as \u0027shears.\u0027 But, though known to sailors, I invented it there on Endeavor Island. By crossing and lashing the ends of two spars and then elevating them in the air like an inverted V, I could get a point above the deck to which to make fast my hoisting-tackle. To this tackle I could, if necessary, attach a second tackle. And then there was the windlass! \n \n Maud saw that I had achieved a solution, and her eyes warmed sympathetically. \n \n \u0027What are you going to do?\u0027 she asked. \n \n \u0027Clear that raffle,\u0027 I answered, pointing to the tangled wreckage overside. \n \n Ah, the decisiveness, the very sound of the words, was good in my ears. \u0027Clear that raffle!\u0027 Imagine so salty a phrase on the lips of the Humphrey Van Weyden of a few months gone! \n \n There must have been a touch of the melodramatic in my pose and voice, for Maud smiled. Her appreciation of the ridiculous was keen, and in all things she unerringly saw and felt, where it existed, the touch of sham, the overshading, the overtone. It was this which had given poise and penetration to her own work and made her of worth to the world. The serious critic, with the sense of humor and the power of expression, must inevitably command the world\u0027s ear. And so it was that she had commanded. Her sense of humor was really the artist\u0027s instinct for proportion. \n \n \u0027I\u0027m sure I\u0027ve heard it before, somewhere, in books,\u0027 she murmured gleefully. \n \n I had an instinct for proportion myself, and I collapsed forthwith, descending from the dominant pose of a master of matter to a state of humble confusion which was, to say the least, very miserable. \n \n Her hand leaped out at once to mine. \n \n \u0027I\u0027m so sorry,\u0027 she said. \n \n \u0027No need to be,\u0027 I gulped. \u0027It does me good. There\u0027s too much of the schoolboy in me. All of which is neither here nor there. What we\u0027ve got to do is actually and literally to clear that raffle. If you\u0027ll come with me in the boat, we\u0027ll get to work and straighten things out.\u0027 \n \n \u0027\"When the topmen clear the raffle with their clasp-knives in their teeth,\"\u0027 she quoted at me; and for the rest of the afternoon we made merry over our labor. \n \n Her task was to hold the boat in position while I worked at the tangle. And such a tangle- halyards, sheets, guys, downhauls, shrouds, stays, all washed about and back and forth and through and twined and knitted by the sea. I cut no more than was necessary, and what with passing the long ropes under and around the booms and masts, of unreeving the halyards and sheets, of coiling down in the boat and uncoiling in order to pass through another knot in the bight, I was soon wet to the skin. \n \n The sails did require some cutting, and the canvas, heavy with water, tried my strength severely; but I succeeded before nightfall in getting it all spread out on the beach to dry. We were both very tired when we knocked off for supper, and we had done good work, too, though to the eye it appeared insignificant. \n \n Next morning, with Maud as able assistant, I went into the hold of the Ghost to clear the steps of the mast-butts. We had no more than begun work when the sound of my knocking and hammering brought Wolf Larsen. \n \n \u0027Hello, below!\u0027 he cried down the open hatch. \n \n The sound of his voice made Maud quickly draw close to me, as for protection, and she rested one hand on my arm while we parleyed. \n \n \u0027Hello, on deck!\u0027 I replied. \u0027Good morning to you.\u0027 \n \n \u0027What are you doing down there?\u0027 he demanded. \u0027Trying to scuttle my ship for me?\u0027 \n \n \u0027Quite the opposite; I\u0027m repairing her,\u0027 was my answer. \n \n \u0027But what in thunder are you repairing?\u0027 There was puzzlement in his voice. \n \n \u0027Why, I\u0027m getting everything ready for restepping the masts,\u0027 I replied easily, as though it were the simplest project imaginable. \n \n \u0027It seems as though you\u0027re standing on your own legs at last, Hump,\u0027 we heard him say; and then for some time he was silent. \n \n \u0027But I say, Hump,\u0027 he called down, \u0027you can\u0027t do it.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Oh, yes, I can,\u0027 I retorted. \u0027I\u0027m doing it now.\u0027 \n \n \u0027But this is my vessel, my particular property. What if I forbid you?\u0027 \n \n \u0027You forget,\u0027 I replied. \u0027You are no longer the biggest bit of the ferment. You were once, and able to eat me, as you were pleased to phrase it; but there has been a diminishing, and I am now able to eat you. The yeast has grown stale.\u0027 \n \n He gave a short, disagreeable laugh. \u0027I see you\u0027re working on my philosophy back on me for all it is worth. But don\u0027t make the mistake of underestimating me. For your own good I warn you.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Since when have you become an altruist?\u0027 I queried. \u0027Confess, now, in warning me for my own good, that you are very inconsistent.\u0027 \n \n He ignored my sarcasm, saying, \u0027Suppose I clap the hatch on now? You won\u0027t fool me as you did in the lazaret.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Wolf Larsen,\u0027 I said sternly, for the first time addressing him by this his most familiar name, \u0027I am unable to shoot a helpless, unresisting man. You have proved that to my satisfaction as well as yours. But I warn you now, and not so much for your own good as for mine, that I shall shoot you the moment you attempt a hostile act. I can shoot you now, as I stand here; and if you are so minded, just go ahead and try to clap on the hatch.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Nevertheless I forbid you; I distinctly forbid your tampering with my ship.\u0027 \n \n \u0027But, man!\u0027 I expostulated. \u0027You advance the fact that it is your ship as though it were a moral right. You have never considered moral rights in your dealings with others. You surely do not dream that I\u0027ll consider them in dealing with you?\u0027 \n \n I had stepped underneath the open hatchway so that I could see him. The lack of expression on his face, so different from when I had watched him unseen, was enhanced by the unblinking, staring eyes. It was not a pleasant face to look upon. \n \n \u0027And none so poor, not even Hump, to do him reverence,\u0027 he sneered. \n \n The sneer was wholly in his voice. His face remained expressionless as ever. \n \n \u0027How do you do, Miss Brewster?\u0027 he said suddenly, after a pause. \n \n I started. She had made no noise whatever, had not even moved. Could it be that some glimmer of vision remained to him? Or that his vision was coming back? \n \n \u0027How do you do, Captain Larsen?\u0027 she answered. \u0027Pray how did you know I was here?\u0027 \n \n \u0027Heard you breathing, of course. I say, Hump\u0027s improving; don\u0027t you think so?\u0027 \n \n \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 she answered, smiling at me. \u0027I have never seen him otherwise.\u0027 \n \n \u0027You should have seen him before, then.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Wolf Larsen in large doses,\u0027 I murmured, \u0027before and after taking.\u0027 \n \n \u0027I want to tell you again, Hump,\u0027 he said threateningly, \u0027that you\u0027d better leave things alone.\u0027 \n \n \u0027But don\u0027t you care to escape as well as we?\u0027 I asked incredulously. \n \n \u0027No,\u0027 was his answer. \u0027I intend dying here.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Well, we don\u0027t,\u0027 I concluded defiantly, beginning again my knocking and hammering. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/94/4945.html","bookId":293,"book":{"id":293,"title":"The Sea-Wolf海狼","description":"简介： The Sea-Wolf is a 1904 psychological adventure novel by American novelist Jack London about a literary critic and other survivors of an ocean collision who come under the dominance of Wolf Larsen, the powerful and amoral sea captain who rescues ...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1289609238bf31c.jpg","type":"Inspirational","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/94","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:30 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:30 AM"}}
