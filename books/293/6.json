{"id":20803,"no":6,"title":"Chapter 6","content":"BY THE FOLLOWING MORNING the storm had blown itself quite out, and the Ghost was rolling slightly on a calm sea without a breath of wind. Occasional light airs were felt, however, and Wolf Larsen patrolled the poop constantly, his eyes ever searching the sea to the northeast, from which direction the great trade-wind must blow. The men are all on deck and busy preparing their various boats for the season\u0027s hunting. There are seven boats aboard, the captain\u0027s dinghy and the six which the hunters will use. Three, a hunter, a boat-puller, and a boat-steerer, compose a boat\u0027s crew. On board the schooner the boat-pullers and steerers are the crew. The hunters, too, are supposed to be in command of the watches, subject always to the orders of Wolf Larsen. All this, and more, I have learned. The Ghost is considered the fastest schooner in both the San Francisco and Victoria fleets. In fact, she was once a private yacht, and was built for speed. Her lines and fittings, though I know nothing about such things, speak for themselves. Johnson was telling me about her in a short chat I had with him during yesterday\u0027s second dog-watch. He spoke most enthusiastically, with the love for a fine craft such as some men feel for horses. He is greatly disgusted with the outlook, and I am given to understand that Wolf Larsen bears a very unsavory reputation among the sealing-captains. It was the Ghost herself that lured Johnson into signing for the voyage, but he is already beginning to repent. As he told me, the Ghost is an eighty-ton schooner of a remarkably fine model. Her beam, or width, is twenty-three feet, and her length a little over ninety feet. A lead keel of fabulous but unknown weight makes her very stable, while she carries an immense spread of canvas. From the deck to the truck of the maintopmast is something over a hundred feet, while the foremast with its topmast is eight or ten feet shorter. I am giving these details so that the size of this little floating world which holds twenty-two men may be appreciated. It is a very little world, a mote, a speck, and I marvel that men should dare to venture the sea on a contrivance so small and fragile. Wolf Larsen has also a reputation for reckless carrying on of sail. I overheard Henderson and another of the hunters, Standish, a Californian, talking about it. Two years ago he dismasted the Ghost in a gale in Bering Sea, whereupon the present masts were put in, which are stronger and heavier in every way. He is said to have remarked, when he put them in, that he preferred turning her over to losing the sticks. Every man aboard, with the exception of Johansen, who is rather overcome by his promotion, seems to have an excuse for having sailed on the Ghost. Half the men forward are deep-water sailors, and their excuse is that they did not know anything about her or her captain. And those who do know whisper that the hunters, while excellent shots, were so notorious for their quarrelsome and rascally proclivities that they could not sign on any decent schooner. I have made the acquaintance of another one of the crew. Louis he is called, a rotund and jovial-faced Nova Scotia Irishman, and a very sociable fellow, prone to talk as long as he can find a listener. In the afternoon, while the cook was below asleep and I was peeling the everlasting potatoes, Louis dropped into the galley for a \u0027yarn.\u0027 His excuse for being aboard was that he was drunk when he signed. He assured me again and again that it was the last thing in the world he would dream of doing in a sober moment. It seems that he has been seal-hunting regularly each season for a dozen years, and is accounted one of the two or three very best boat-steerers in both fleets. \u0027Ah, my boy,\u0027- he shook his head ominously at me,- \u0027\u0027t is the worst schooner ye could iv selected; nor were ye drunk at the time, as was I. \u0027T is sealin\u0027 is the sailor\u0027s paradise- on other ships than this. The mate was the first, but, mark me words, there\u0027ll be more dead men before the trip is done with. Hist, now, between you an\u0027 meself an\u0027 the stanchion there, this Wolf Larsen is a regular devil, an\u0027 the Ghost\u0027ll be a hell-ship like she\u0027s always be\u0027n since he had hold iv her. Don\u0027t I know? Don\u0027t I know? Don\u0027t I remember him in Hakodate two years gone, when he had a row an\u0027 shot four iv his men? Wasn\u0027t I a-layin\u0027 on the Emma L., not three hundred yards away? An\u0027 there was a man the same year he killed with a blow iv his fist. Yes, sir, killed \u0027im dead- oh. His head must iv smashed like an egg-shell. \u0027T is the beast he is, this Wolf Larsen- the great big beast mentioned iv in Revelations; an\u0027 no good end will he ever come to. But I\u0027ve said nothin\u0027 to ye, mind ye; I\u0027ve whispered never a word; for old fat Louis\u0027ll live the voyage out, if the last mother\u0027s son of yez go to the fishes. \u0027Wolf Larsen!\u0027 he snorted a moment later. \u0027Listen to the word, will ye! Wolf- \u0027t is what he is. He\u0027s not black-hearted, like some men. \u0027T is no heart he has at all. Wolf, just wolf, \u0027t is what he is. D\u0027ye wonder he\u0027s well named?\u0027 \u0027But if he is so well known for what he is,\u0027 I queried, \u0027how is it that he can get men to ship with him?\u0027 \u0027An\u0027 how is it ye can get men to do anything on God\u0027s earth an\u0027 sea?\u0027 Louis demanded with Celtic fire. \u0027How d\u0027 ye find me aboard if \u0027t wasn\u0027t that I was drunk as a pig when I put me name down? There\u0027s them that can\u0027t sail with better men, like the hunters, an\u0027 them that don\u0027t know, like the poor devils of wind-jammers for\u0027ard there. But they\u0027ll come to it, they\u0027ll come to it, an\u0027 be sorry the day they was born. I could weep for the poor creatures, did I but forget poor old fat Louis and the troubles before him. But \u0027t is not a whisper I\u0027ve dropped; mind ye, not a whisper. \u0027Them hunters is the wicked boys,\u0027 he broke forth again, for he suffered from a constitutional plethora of speech. \u0027But wait till they get to cuttin\u0027 up iv jinks an\u0027 rowin\u0027 round. He\u0027s the boy\u0027ll fix \u0027em. \u0027T is him that\u0027ll put the fear of God in their rotten black hearts. Look at that hunter iv mine, Horner. \"Jock\" Horner they call him, so quiet-like an\u0027 easy-goin\u0027; soft-spoken as a girl, till ye\u0027d think butter wouldn\u0027t melt in the mouth iv him. Didn\u0027t he kill his boat-steerer last year? \u0027T was called a sad accident, but I met the boat-puller in Yokohama, an\u0027 the straight iv it was given me. An\u0027 there\u0027s Smoke, the black little devil- didn\u0027t the Roosians have him for three years in the salt-mines of Siberia for poachin\u0027 on Copper Island, which is a Roosian preserve? Shackled he was, hand an\u0027 foot, with his mate. An\u0027 didn\u0027t they have words or a ruction of some kind? For \u0027t was the other fellow Smoke sent up in the buckets to the top of the mine; an\u0027 a piece at a time he went up, a leg today, an\u0027 tomorrow an arm, the next day the head, an\u0027 so on.\u0027 \u0027But you can\u0027t mean it!\u0027 I cried out, overcome with the horror of it. \u0027Mean what?\u0027 he demanded, quick as a flash. \u0027\u0027T is nothin\u0027 I\u0027ve said. Deef I am, an\u0027 dumb, as ye should be for the sake iv your mother; an\u0027 never once have I opened me lips but to say fine things iv them an\u0027 him, God curse his soul! an\u0027 may he rot in purgatory ten thousand years, an\u0027 then go down to the last an\u0027 deepest hell iv all!\u0027 Johnson, the man who had chafed me raw when I first came aboard, seemed the least equivocal of the men for\u0027ard or aft. In fact, there was nothing equivocal about him. One was struck at once by his straightforwardness and manliness, which, in turn, were tempered by a modesty which might be mistaken for timidity. But timid he was not. He seemed rather to have the courage of his convictions, the certitude of his manhood. It was this that made him protest, at the beginning of our acquaintance, against being called Yonson. And upon this and him Louis passed judgment and prophecy. \u0027\u0027T is a fine chap, that squarehead Johnson we\u0027ve for\u0027ard with us,\u0027 he said. \u0027The best sailorman in the fo\u0027c\u0027s\u0027le. He\u0027s my boat-puller. But it\u0027s to trouble he\u0027ll come with Wolf Larsen, as the sparks fly upward. It\u0027s meself that knows. I can see it brewin\u0027 an\u0027 comin\u0027 up like a storm in the sky. I\u0027ve talked to him like a brother, but it\u0027s little he sees in takin\u0027 in his lights or flyin\u0027 false signals. He grumbles out when things don\u0027t go to suit him, an\u0027 there\u0027ll be always some telltale carryin\u0027 word iv it aft to the Wolf. The Wolf is strong, an\u0027 it\u0027s the way of a wolf to hate strength, an\u0027 strength is is he\u0027ll see in Johnson- no knucklin\u0027 under, an\u0027 a \"Yes, sir; thank ye kindly, sir,\" for a curse or a blow. Oh, she\u0027s a-comin\u0027! She\u0027s a-comin\u0027! An\u0027 God knows where I\u0027ll get another boat-puller. What does the fool up an\u0027 say, when the Old Man calls him Yonson, but \"Me name is Johnson, sir,\" and\u0027 then spells it out, letter for letter. Ye should iv seen the Old Man\u0027s face! I thought he\u0027d let drive at him on the spot. He didn\u0027t, but he will, an\u0027 he\u0027ll break that squarehead\u0027s heart, or it\u0027s little I know iv the ways iv men on the ships iv the sea.\u0027 Thomas Mugridge is becoming unendurable. I am compelled to mister him and to sir him with every speech. One reason for this is that Wolf Larsen seems to have taken a fancy to him. It is an unprecedented thing, I take it, for a captain to be chummy with the cook, but this is certainly what Wolf Larsen is doing. Two or three times he put his head into the galley and chaffed Mugridge good-naturedly, and once, this afternoon, he stood by the break of the poop and chatted with him for fully fifteen minutes. When it was over, and Mugridge was back in the galley, he became greasily radiant and went about his work humming Coster songs in a nerve-racking and discordant falsetto. \u0027I always get along with the officers,\u0027 he remarked to me in a confidential tone. \u0027I know the w\u0027y, I do, to myke myself uppreci-yted. There was my last skipper- w\u0027y, I thought nothin\u0027 of droppin\u0027 down in the cabin for a little chat an\u0027 a friendly glass. \"Mugridge,\" says \u0027e to me, \"Mugridge,\" says \u0027e, \"you\u0027ve missed yer vocytion.\" \"an\u0027 ow\u0027s that?\" says I. \"Yer should\u0027 a\u0027 been born a gentleman, an\u0027 never \u0027ad to work for yer livin\u0027.\" God strike me dead, \u0027Ump, if that ayn\u0027t wot \u0027e says, an\u0027 me a-sittin\u0027 there in \u0027is own cabin, jolly- like an\u0027 comfortable, a-smokin\u0027 \u0027is cigars an\u0027 drinkin\u0027 \u0027is rum.\u0027 This chitter-chatter drove me to distraction. I never heard a voice I hated so. His oily, insinuating tones, his greasy smile, and his monstrous self-conceit grated on my nerves till sometimes I was all in a tremble. Positively he was the most disgusting and loathsome person I have ever met. The filth of his cooking was indescribable; and as he cooked everything that was eaten aboard, I was compelled to select with great circumspection what I ate, choosing from the least dirty of his concoctions. My hands bothered me a great deal, unused as they were to work. The nails were discolored and black, while the skin was already grained with dirt which even a scrubbing-brush could not remove. Then blisters came, in a painful and never-ending procession, and I had a great burn on my forearm, acquired by losing my balance in a roll of the ship and pitching against the galley stove. Nor was my knee any better. The swelling had not gone down, and the cap was still up on edge. Hobbling about on it from morning to night was not helping it any. What I needed was rest, if it were ever to get well. Rest! I never before knew the meaning of the word. I had been resting all my life and did not know it. But now could I sit still for one half-hour and do nothing, not even think, it would be the most pleasurable thing in the world. But it is a revelation, on the other hand. I shall be able to appreciate the lives of the working-people hereafter. I did not dream that work was so terrible a thing. From half-past five in the morning till ten o\u0027clock at night I am everybody\u0027s slave, with not one moment to myself except such as I can steal near the end of the second dog-watch. Let me pause for a minute to look out over the sea sparkling in the sun, or to gaze at a sailor going aloft to the gaff topsails or running out the bowsprit, and I am sure to hear the hateful voice, \u0027\u0027Ere, you, \u0027Ump! No sodgerin\u0027! I\u0027ve got my peepers on yer.\u0027 There are signs of rampant bad temper in the steerage, and the gossip is going around that Smoke and Henderson have had a fight. Henderson seems the best of the hunters, a slow-going fellow and hard to rouse; but roused he must have been for Smoke had a bruised and discolored eye and looked particularly vicious when he came into the cabin for supper. A cruel thing happened just before supper, indicative of the callousness and brutishness of these men. There is one green hand in the crew, Harrison by name, a clumsy-looking country boy, mastered, I imagine, by the spirit of adventure, and making his first voyage. In the light, baffling airs, the schooner has been tacking about a great deal, at which times the sails pass from one side to the other, and a man is sent aloft to shift over the fore-gaff topsail. In some way, when Harrison was aloft, the sheet jammed in the block through which it runs at the end of the gaff. As I understood it, there were two ways of getting it cleared- first, by lowering the foresail, which was comparatively easy and without danger; and, second, by climbing out on the peak-halyards to the end of the gaff itself, a very hazardous performance. Johansen called out to Harrison to go out on the halyards. It was patent to everybody that the boy was afraid. And well he might be, eighty feet above the deck, to trust himself on those thin and jerking ropes. Had there been a steady breeze it would not have been so bad, but the Ghost was rolling emptily in a long sea, and with each roll the canvas flapped and boomed and the halyards slacked and jerked taut. They were capable of snapping a man off like a fly from a whiplash. Harrison heard the order and understood what was demanded of him, but hesitated. It was probably the first time in his life he had been aloft. Johansen, who had caught the contagion of Wolf Larsen\u0027s masterfulness, burst out with a volley of abuse and curses. \u0027That\u0027ll do, Johansen!\u0027 Wolf Larsen said brusquely. \u0027I\u0027ll have you know that I do the swearing on this ship. If I need your assistance, I\u0027ll call you in.\u0027 \u0027Yes, sir,\u0027 the mate acknowledged submissively. In the meantime Harrison had started out on the halyards. I was looking up from the galley door, and I could see him trembling in every limb as with ague. He proceeded very slowly and cautiously, an inch at a time. Outlined against the clear blue of the sky, he had the appearance of an enormous spider crawling along the tracery of its web. It was a slightly uphill climb, for the foresail peaked high; and the halyards, running through various blocks on the gaff and mast, gave him separate holds for hands and feet. But the trouble lay in that the wind was not strong enough or steady enough to keep the sail full. When he was halfway out, the Ghost took a long roll to windward and back again into the hollow between two seas. Harrison ceased his progress and held on tightly. Eighty feet beneath I could see the agonized strain of his muscles as he gripped for very life. The sail emptied and the gaff swung amidships. The halyards slackened, and, though it all happened very quickly, I could see them sag beneath the weight of his body. Then the gaff swung to the side with an abrupt swiftness, the great sail boomed like a cannon, and the three rows of reef-points slatted against the canvas like a volley of rifles. Harrison, clinging on, made the giddy rush through the air. This rush ceased abruptly. The halyards became instantly taut. It was the snap of the whip. His clutch was broken. One hand was torn loose from its hold. The other lingered desperately for a moment, and followed. His body pitched out and down, but in some way he managed to save himself with his legs. He was hanging by them, head downward. A quick effort brought his hands up to the halyards again; but he was a long time regaining his former position, where he hung, a pitiable object. \u0027I\u0027ll bet he has no appetite for supper,\u0027 I heard Wolf Larsen\u0027s voice, which came to me from around the corner of the galley. \u0027Look at his gills.\u0027 In truth Harrison was very sick, as a person is seasick; and for a long time clung to his precarious perch without attempting to move. Johansen, however, continued violently to urge him on to the completion of his task. \u0027It is a shame,\u0027 I heard Johnson growling in painfully slow and correct English. He was standing by the main rigging, a few feet away from me. \u0027The boy is willing enough. He will learn if he has a chance. But this- \u0027 He paused a while, for the word \u0027murder\u0027 was his final judgment. \u0027Hist, will ye!\u0027 Louis whispered to him. \u0027For the love iv your mother, hold your mouth!\u0027 But Johnson, looking on, still continued his grumbling. \u0027Look here,\u0027- the hunter Standish spoke to Wolf Larsen,- \u0027that\u0027s my boat-puller, and I don\u0027t want to lose him.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s all right, Standish,\u0027 was the reply. \u0027He\u0027s your boat-puller when you\u0027ve got him in the boat, but he\u0027s my sailor when I have him aboard, and I\u0027ll do what I well please with him.\u0027 \u0027But that\u0027s no reason- \u0027 Standish began in a torrent of speech. \u0027That\u0027ll do; easy as she goes,\u0027 Wolf Larsen counseled back. \u0027I\u0027ve told you what\u0027s what, and let it stop at that. The man\u0027s mine, and I\u0027ll make soup of him and eat it if I want to.\u0027 There was an angry gleam in the hunter\u0027s eye, but he turned on his heel and entered the steerage companionway, where he remained, looking upward. All hands were on deck now, and all eyes were aloft, where a human life was at grapples with death. The callousness of these men, to whom industrial organization gave control of the lives of other men, was appalling. I, who had lived out of the whirl of the world, had never dreamed that its work was carried on in such fashion. Life had always seemed a peculiarly sacred thing; but here it counted for nothing, was a cipher in the arithmetic of commerce. I must say, however, that the sailors themselves were sympathetic, as instance the case of Johnson; but the masters (the hunters and the captain) were heartlessly indifferent. Even the protest of Standish arose out of the fact that he did not wish to lose his boat-puller. Had it been some other hunter\u0027s boat-puller, he, like them, would have been no more than amused. But to return to Harrison. It took Johansen, insulting and reviling the poor wretch, fully ten minutes to get him started again. A little later he made the end of the gaff, where, astride the spar itself, he had a better chance for holding on. He cleared the sheet, and was free to return, slightly downhill now, along the halyards to the mast. But he had lost his nerve. Unsafe as was his present position, he was loath to forsake it for the more unsafe position on the halyards. He looked along the airy path he must traverse, and then down to the deck. His eyes were wide and staring, and he was trembling violently. I had never seen fear so strongly stamped upon a human face. Johansen called vainly for him to come down. At any moment he was liable to be snapped off the gaff, but he was helpless with fright. Wolf Larsen, walking up and down with Smoke and in conversation, took no more notice of him, though he cried sharply, once, to the man at the wheel: \u0027You\u0027re off your course, my man! Be careful, unless you\u0027re looking for trouble.\u0027 \u0027Aye, aye, sir,\u0027 the helmsman responded, putting a couple of spokes down. He had been guilty of running the Ghost several points off her course, in order that what little wind there was should fill the foresail and hold it steady. He had striven to help the unfortunate Harrison at the risk of incurring Wolf Larsen\u0027s anger. The time went by, and the suspense, to me, was terrible. Thomas Mugridge, on the other hand, considered it a laughable affair, and was continually bobbing his head out of the galley door to make jocose remarks. How I hated him! And how my hatred for him grew and grew, during that fearful time, to cyclopean dimensions! For the first time in my life I experienced the desire to murder- \u0027saw red,\u0027 as some of our picturesque writers phrase it. Life in general might still be sacred, but life in the particular case of Thomas Mugridge had become very profane indeed. I was frightened when I became conscious that I was seeing red, and the thought flashed through my mind: Was I, too, becoming tainted by the brutality of my environment?- I, who even in the most flagrant crimes had denied the justice and righteousness of capital punishment. Fully half an hour went by, and then I saw Johnson and Louis in some sort of altercation. It ended with Johnson flinging off Louis\u0027s detaining arm and starting forward. He crossed the deck, sprang into the fore rigging, and began to climb. But the quick eye of Wolf Larsen caught him. \u0027Here, you, what are you up to?\u0027 he cried. Johnson\u0027s ascent was arrested. He looked his captain in the eyes and replied slowly: \u0027I am going to get that boy down.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027ll get down out of that rigging, and- lively about it! D\u0027ye hear! Get down!\u0027 Johnson hesitated, but the long years of obedience to the masters of ships overpowered him, and he dropped sullenly to the deck and went on forward. At half after five I went below to set the cabin table; but I hardly knew what I did, for my eyes and brain were filled with the vision of a man, white-faced and trembling, comically, like a bug, clinging to the thrashing gaff. At six o\u0027clock, when I served supper, going on deck to get the food from the galley, I saw Harrison, still in the same position. The conversation at the table was of other things. Nobody seemed interested in the wantonly imperiled life. But, making an extra trip to the galley a little later, I was gladdened by the sight of Harrison staggering weakly from the rigging to the forecastle scuttle. He had finally summoned the courage to descend. Before closing this incident, I must give a scrap of conversation I had with Wolf Larsen in the cabin, while I was washing the dishes. \u0027You were looking squeamish this afternoon,\u0027 he began. \u0027What was the matter?\u0027 I could see that he knew what had made me possibly as sick as Harrison, that he was trying to draw me, and I answered: \u0027It was because of the brutal treatment of that boy.\u0027 He gave a short laugh. \u0027Like seasickness, I suppose. Some men are subject to it, and others are not.\u0027 \u0027Not so,\u0027 I objected. \u0027Just so,\u0027 he went on. \u0027The earth is as full of brutality as the sea is full of motion. And some men are made sick by the one, and some by the other. That\u0027s the only reason.\u0027 \u0027But you who make a mock of human life, don\u0027t you place any value upon it whatever?\u0027 I demanded. \u0027Value? What value? He looked at me, and though his eyes were steady and motionless, there seemed a cynical smile in them. \u0027What kind of value? How do you measure it? Who values it?\u0027 \u0027I do,\u0027 I made answer. \u0027Then what is it worth to you? Another man\u0027s life, I mean. Come, now, what is it worth?\u0027 The value of life? How could I put a tangible value upon it? Somehow I, who have always had expression, lacked expression when with Wolf Larsen. I have since determined that a part of it was due to the man\u0027s personality, but that the greater part was due to his totally different outlook. Unlike other materialists I had met, and with whom I had something in common to start on, I had nothing in common with him. Perhaps, also, it was the elemental simplicity of his mind that baffled me. He drove so directly to the core of the matter, divesting a question always of all superfluous details, and with such an air of finality, that I seemed to find myself struggling in deep water with no footing under me. Value of life? How could I answer the question on the spur of the moment? The sacredness of life I had accepted as axiomatic. That it was intrinsically valuable was a truism I had never questioned. But when he challenged the truism I was speechless. \u0027We were talking about this yesterday,\u0027 he said. \u0027I held that life was a ferment, a yeasty something which devoured life that it might live, and that living was merely successful piggishness. Why, if there is anything in supply and demand, life is the cheapest thing in the world. There is only so much water, so much earth, so much air; but the life that is demanding to be born is limitless. Nature is a spendthrift. Look at the fish and their millions of eggs. For that matter, look at you and me. In our loins are the possibilities of millions of lives. Could we but find time and opportunity and utilize the last bit and every bit of the unborn life that is in us, we could become the fathers of nations and populate continents. Life? Bah! It has no value. Of cheap things it is the cheapest. Everywhere it goes begging. Nature spills it out with a lavish hand. Where there is room for one life, she sows a thousand lives, and it\u0027s life eat life till the strongest and most piggish life is left.\u0027 \u0027You have read Darwin,\u0027 I said. \u0027But you read him misunderstandingly when you conclude that the struggle for existence sanctions your wanton destruction of life.\u0027 He shrugged his shoulders. \u0027You know you only mean that in relation to human life, for of the flesh and the fowl and the fish you destroy as much as I or any other man. And human life is in no wise different, though you feel it is and think that you reason why it is. Why should I be parsimonious with this life which is cheap and without value? There are more sailors than there are ships on the sea for them, more workers than there are factories or machines for them. Why, you who live on the land know that you house your poor people in the slums of cities and loose famine and pestilence upon them, and that there still remain more poor people, dying for want of a crust of bread and a bit of meat (which is life destroyed), than you know what to do with. Have you ever seen the London dockers fighting like wild beasts for a chance to work?\u0027 He started for the companion-stairs, but turned his head for a final word. \u0027Do you know, the only value life has is what life puts upon itself; and it is of course overestimated, since it is of necessity prejudiced in its own favor. Take that man I had aloft. He held on as if he were a precious thing, a treasure beyond diamonds or rubies. To you? No. To me? Not at all. To himself, yes. But I do not accept his estimate. He sadly overrates himself. There is plenty more life demanding to be born. Had he fallen and dripped his brains upon the deck like honey from the comb, there would have been no loss to the world. He was worth nothing to the world. The supply is too large. To himself only was he of value, and to show how fictitious even this value was, being dead, he is unconscious that he has lost himself. He alone rated himself beyond diamonds and rubies. Diamonds and rubies are gone, spread out on the deck to be washed away by a bucket of sea-water, and he does not even know that the diamonds and rubies are gone. He does not lose anything, for with the loss of himself he loses the knowledge of loss. Don\u0027t you see? And what have you to say?\u0027 \u0027That you are at least consistent,\u0027 was all I could say, and I went on washing the dishes.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/94/4917.html","bookId":293,"book":{"id":293,"title":"The Sea-Wolf海狼","description":"简介： The Sea-Wolf is a 1904 psychological adventure novel by American novelist Jack London about a literary critic and other survivors of an ocean collision who come under the dominance of Wolf Larsen, the powerful and amoral sea captain who rescues ...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1289609238bf31c.jpg","type":"Inspirational","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/94","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:30 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:30 AM"}}
