{"id":20835,"no":38,"title":"Chapter 38","content":"\u0027I THINK MY LEFT SIDE IS GOING.\u0027 Wolf Larsen wrote, the morning after his attempt to fire the ship. \u0027The numbness is growing. I can hardly move my hand. You will have to speak louder. The last lines are going down.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Are you in pain?\u0027 I asked. \n \n I was compelled to repeat my question loudly before he answered: \n \n \u0027Not all the time.\u0027 \n \n The left hand stumbled slowly and painfully across the paper, and it was with extreme difficulty that we deciphered the scrawl. It was like a \u0027spirit message,\u0027 such as are delivered at seances of spiritualists for a dollar admission. \n \n \u0027But I am still here, all here,\u0027 hand scrawled, more slowly and painfully than ever. \n \n The pencil dropped, and we had to replace it in the hand. \n \n \u0027When there is no pain I have perfect peace and quiet. I have never thought so clearly. I can ponder life and death like a Hindu sage.\u0027 \n \n \u0027And immortality?\u0027 Maud queried loudly in the ear. \n \n Three times the hand essayed to write, but fumbled hopelessly. The pencil fell. In vain we tried to replace it. The fingers could not close on it. Then Maud pressed and held the fingers, about the pencil with her own hand, and the hand wrote, in large letters, and so slowly that the minutes ticked off to each letter: \n \n \u0027B-O-S-H.\u0027 \n \n It was Wolf Larsen\u0027s last word,- \u0027bosh,\u0027- skeptical and invincible to the end. The arm and hand relaxed. The trunk of the body moved slightly. Then there was no movement. Maud released the hand. The fingers spread, falling apart of their own weight, and the pencil rolled away. \n \n \u0027Do you still hear?\u0027 I shouted, holding the fingers and waiting for the single pressure which would signify \u0027yes.\u0027 There was no response. The hand was dead. \n \n \u0027I noticed the lips slightly move,\u0027 Maud said. \n \n I repeated the question. The lips moved. She placed the tips of her fingers on them. Again I repeated the question. \u0027Yes,\u0027 Maud announced. We looked at each other expectantly. \n \n \u0027What good is it?\u0027 I asked. \u0027What can we say now?\u0027 \n \n \u0027Oh, ask him-\u0027 \n \n She hesitated. \n \n \u0027Ask him something that requires \"no\" for an answer,\u0027 I suggested. \u0027Then we shall know with certainty.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Are you hungry?\u0027 she cried. \n \n The lips moved under her fingers, and she answered, \u0027Yes.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Will you have some beef?\u0027 was her next query. \n \n \u0027No,\u0027 she announced. \n \n \u0027Beef-tea?\u0027 \n \n \u0027Yes, he will have some beef-tea,\u0027 she said quietly, looking up at me. \u0027Until his hearing goes we shall be able to communicate with him. And after that-\u0027 \n \n She looked at me queerly. I saw her lips trembling and the tears swimming up in her eyes. She swayed toward me, and I caught her in my arms. \n \n \u0027Oh, Humphrey,\u0027 she sobbed, \u0027when will it all end? I am so tired, so tired!\u0027 \n \n She buried her head on my shoulder, her frail form shaken with a storm of weeping. She was like a feather in my arms, so slender, so ethereal. \u0027She has broken down at last,\u0027 I thought. \u0027What can I do without her help?\u0027 \n \n But I soothed and comforted her, till she pulled herself bravely together and recuperated mentally as quickly as she was wont to do physically. \n \n \u0027I ought to be ashamed of myself,\u0027 she said. Then added, with the whimsical smile I adored, \u0027But I am only one small woman.\u0027 \n \n That phrase, \u0027one small woman,\u0027 startled me like an electric shock. It was my own phrase, my pet, secret phrase, my love-phrase for her. \n \n \u0027Where did you get that phrase?\u0027 I demanded, with an abruptness that in turn startled her. \n \n \u0027What phrase?\u0027 she asked. \n \n \u0027\"One small woman.\"\u0027 \n \n \u0027Is it yours?\u0027 she asked. \n \n \u0027Yes,\u0027 I answered, \u0027mine. I made it.\u0027 \n \n \u0027Then you must have talked in your sleep,\u0027 she smiled. \n \n The dancing, tremulous light was in her eyes. Mine, I knew, were speaking beyond the will of my speech. I leaned toward her. Without volition I leaned toward her, as a tree is swayed by the wind. Ah, we were very close together in that moment. But she shook her head, as one might shake off sleep or a dream, saying: \n \n \u0027I have known it all my life. It was my father\u0027s name for my mother.\u0027 \n \n \u0027It is my phrase, too,\u0027 I said stubbornly. \n \n \u0027For your mother?\u0027 \n \n \u0027No,\u0027 I answered; and she questioned no further, though I could have sworn her eyes retained for some time a mocking, teasing expression. \n \n With the foremast in, the work now went on apace. Almost before I knew it, and without one serious hitch, I had the mainmast stepped. A derrick-boom rigged to the foremast had accomplished this; and several days more found all stays and shrouds in place and everything set up taut. Topsails would be a nuisance and a danger for a crew of two, so I heaved the topmasts on deck and lashed them fast. \n \n Several more days were consumed in finishing the sails and putting them on. There were only three- the jib, foresail, and mainsail; and, patched, shortened, and distorted, they were a ridiculously ill-fitting suit for so trim a craft as the Ghost. \n \n \u0027But they\u0027ll work,\u0027 Maud cried jubilantly. \u0027We\u0027ll make them work, and trust our lives to them!\u0027 \n \n Certainly, among my many new trades, I shone least as a sailmaker. I could sail them better than make them, and I had no doubt of my power to bring the schooner to some northern port of Japan. In fact, I had crammed navigation from textbooks aboard; and, besides, there was Wolf Larsen\u0027s star-scale, so simple a device that a child could work it. \n \n As for its inventor, beyond an increasing deafness and the movement of the lips growing faint and fainter, there had been little change in his condition for a week. But on the day we finished bending the schooner\u0027s sails he heard his last, and the last movement of the lips died away, but not before I had asked him, \u0027Are you all there?\u0027 and the lips had answered, \u0027Yes.\u0027 \n \n The last line was down. Somewhere within that tomb of the flesh still dwelt the soul of the man. Walled by the living clay, that fierce intelligence we had known burned on; but it burned on in silence and darkness. And it was disembodied. To that intelligence there could be no objective knowledge of a body. It knew no body. The very world was not. It knew only itself and the vastness and profundity of the quiet and the dark. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/94/4949.html","bookId":293,"book":{"id":293,"title":"The Sea-Wolf海狼","description":"简介： The Sea-Wolf is a 1904 psychological adventure novel by American novelist Jack London about a literary critic and other survivors of an ocean collision who come under the dominance of Wolf Larsen, the powerful and amoral sea captain who rescues ...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/uploads/allimg/101230/1289609238bf31c.jpg","type":"Inspirational","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/94","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:30 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:30 AM"}}
