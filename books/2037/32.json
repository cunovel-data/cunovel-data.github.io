Even back riding the thurgs,\"Stefan said. \"I know, but there\u0027s something else,\"Bonnie said humbly. \"Since it\u0027s only snow and rock and ice - he\u0027s - I don\u0027t know. He\u0027s al tight. Something\u0027s wrong.\" \"He\u0027s hungry,\"Elena said, stricken by a sudden realization. Since the thurgs there had been nothing for the two vampires to hunt. They couldn\u0027t exist, like foxes, on insects and mice. Of course Lady Ulma had provided plenty of Black Magic for them, the only thing that even resembled a substitute for blood. But their supply was dwindling, and of course, they had to think of the trip back, as well . Suddenly Elena knew what would do her good. \"Stefan,\"she murmured, pul ing him into a nook in the craggy stone of the cave entrance. She pushed off her hood and unrol ed her scarf enough to expose one side of her neck. \"Don\u0027t make me say \u0027please\u0027too many times,\"she whispered to him. \"I can\u0027t wait that long.\" Stefan looked into her eyes, saw that she was serious - and determined - and kissed one of her mittened hands. \"It\u0027s been long enough now, I think - no, I\u0027m sure, or I would never even attempt this,\"he whispered. Elena tipped her head back. Stefan stood between her and the wind and she was almost warm. She felt the little initial pain and then Stefan was drinking and their minds slid together like two raindrops on a glass window. He took very little blood. Just enough to make the difference in his eyes between Stillgreen pools and sparkling, effervescent streams. But then his gaze went Stillagain. \"Damon...\"he said, and paused awkwardly. What could Elena say? I just severed al ties with him? They were supposed to help one another along these trials; to show their wit and courage. If she refused, would she fail again? \"Send him quick then,\"she said. \"Before I change my mind.\" Five minutes later Elena was again tucked into the little nook, while Damon turned her head back and forth with dispassionate precision, then suddenly darted forward and sank his fangs into a prominent vein. Elena felt her eyes go wide. A bite that hurt this much - Well, she hadn\u0027t experienced it since the days when she had been stupid and unprepared and had fought with al her strength to get free. As for Damon\u0027s mind - there was a steel wal . Since she had to do this, she had been hoping to see the little boy who lived in Damon\u0027s inmost soul, the one who was the unwil ing Watch-Keeper over al of his secrets, but she couldn\u0027t even thaw the steel a little. After a minute or two, Stefan pul ed Damon off of her - not gently. Damon came away sul enly, wiping his mouth. \"Are you okay?\"Bonnie asked in a worried whisper, as Elena rummaged through Lady Ulma\u0027s medicine box for a piece of gauze to staunch the unhealed wounds in her neck. \"I\u0027ve been better,\"Elena said briefly, as she wrapped up her scarf again. Bonnie sighed. \"Meredith is the one who real y belongs here,\"she said. \"Yes, but Meredith real y belongs in Fel \u0027s Church, too. I only hope they can hold on long enough for us to come back.\" \"I only hope that we can come back with something that wil help them,\"Bonnie whispered. Meredith and Matt spent the time from 2:00 A.M. to dawn pouring infinitesimal drops from Misao\u0027s star bal onto the streets of the town, and asking the Power to - somehow - help them in the fight against Shinichi. This brisk movement from place to place had also netted a surprising bonus: kids. Not crazy kids. Normal ones, terrified of their brothers and sisters or of their parents, not daring to go home because of the awful things they had seen there. Meredith and Matt had crammed them into Matt\u0027s mother\u0027s second-hand SUV and brought them to Matt\u0027s house. In the end, they had more than thirty kids, from ages five to sixteen, al too frightened to play, or talk, or even to ask for anything. But they\u0027d eaten everything Mrs. Flowers could find that wasn\u0027t spoiled in Matt\u0027s refrigerator and pantry, and from the pantries of the deserted houses on either side of the Honeycutts\u0027. Matt, watching a ten-year-old girl cramming plain white bread into her mouth with wolfish hunger, tears running down her grimy face as she chewed and swal owed, said quietly to Meredith, \"Think we\u0027ve got any ringers in here?\" \"I\u0027d bet my life on it,\"she replied just as quietly. \"But what are we going to do? Cole doesn\u0027t know anything helpful. We\u0027l just have to pray that the un-possessed kids wil be able to help us when Shinichi\u0027s ringers attack.\" \"I think the best option when confronted by possessed kids who may have weapons is to run.\" Meredith nodded absently, but Matt noticed she took the stave everywhere with her now. \"I\u0027ve devised a little test for them. I\u0027m going to smack every one with a Post-It, and see what happens. Kids who\u0027ve done things they regret may get hysterical, kids who\u0027re already just terrified may get some comfort, and the ringers wil either attack or run.\" \"This I have to see.\" Meredith\u0027s test lured out only two ringers in the whole mob, a thirteen-year-old boy and a fifteen-year-old girl. Each of them screamed and darted through the house, shrieking wildly. Matt couldn\u0027t stop them. When it was al over and the older kids were comforting the younger ones, Matt and Meredith finished boarding up the windows and pasting amulets between the boards. They spent the evening scouting for food, questioning the kids about Shinichi and the Last Midnight, and helping Mrs. Flowers treat injuries. They tried to keep one person on guard at alltimes, but since they had been up and moving since 1:30 A.M., they were al very tired. At a quarter to eleven Meredith came to Matt, who was cleaning the scratches of a yel ow-haired eight-year-old. \"Okay,\"she said quietly, \"I\u0027m going to take my car and get the new amulets Mrs. Saitou said she\u0027d have done by now. Do you mind if I take Saber?\" Matt shook his head. \"No, I\u0027l do it. I know the Saitous better, anyway.\" Meredith gave what, in a less refined person, might have been cal ed a snort. \"I know them well enough to say, excuse me, Inari-Obaasan; excuse me, Orime-san; we\u0027re the troublemakers who keep asking for huge amounts of anti-evil amulets, but you don\u0027t mind that, do you?\" Matt smiled faintly, let the eight-year-old go, and said, \"Well, they might mind it less if you got their names straight. \u0027Obaasan\u0027means \u0027grandma,\u0027right?\" \"Yes, of course.\" \"And \u0027san\u0027is just a thingy you put at the end of a name to be polite.\" Meredith nodded, adding, \"And \u0027a thingy at the end\u0027is cal ed an \u0027honorific suffix.\u0027\" \"Yeah, yeah, but for al your big words you\u0027ve got their names wrong. It\u0027s Orime-grandma and Orime-Isobel\u0027s-mother. So Orime-Obaasan and Orime-san, too.\" Meredith sighed. \"Look, Matt, Bonnie and I met them first. Grandma introduced herself as Inari. Now I know she\u0027s a little wacky, but she would certainly know her own name, right?\" \"And she introduced herself to me and said not just that she was named Orime, but that her daughter was named after her. Talk your way out of that one.\" \"Matt, shal I get my notebook? It\u0027s in the boardinghouse den - \" Matt gave a short sharp laugh - almost a sob. He looked to make sure Mrs. Flowers wasn\u0027t around and then hissed, \"It\u0027s somewhere down at the center of the earth, maybe. There is no den anymore.\" For a moment Meredith looked simply shocked, but then she frowned. Matt glared darkly. It didn\u0027t help to think that they were the two most unlikely of their group to quarrel. Here they were, and Matt could practical y see the sparks flying. \"All right,\"Meredith said final y, \"I\u0027l just go over there and ask for Orime-Obaasan, and then tel them it was al your fault when they laugh.\" Matt shook his head. \"Nobody\u0027s going to laugh, because you\u0027re going to get it right that way.\" \"Look, Matt,\"Meredith said, \"I\u0027ve been reading so much on the Internet that I even know the name Inari. I\u0027ve come across it somewhere. And I\u0027m sure I would have made...made the connection...\"Her voice trailed off. When Matt turned his eyes down from the ceiling, he started. Meredith\u0027s face was white and she was breathing quickly. \"Inari...\"she whispered. \"I do know that name, but...\"Suddenly she grabbed Matt\u0027s wrist so hard that it hurt. \"Matt, is your computer absolutely dead?\" \"It went when the electricity went. By now even the generator is gone.\" \"But you have a mobile that connects to the Internet, right?\" The urgency in her voice made Matt, in turn, take her seriously. \"Sure,\"he said. \"But the battery\u0027s been kaput for at least a day. Without electricity I can\u0027t recharge it. And my mom took hers. She can\u0027t live without it. Stefan and Elena must\u0027ve left their stuff at the boardinghouse - \"He shook his head at Meredith\u0027s hopeful expression and whispered, \"Or, should I say, where the boardinghouse used to be.\" \"But we have to find a mobile or computer that works! We have to! I need it to work for just a minute!\"Meredith said frantical y, breaking away from him and beginning to pace as if trying to beat some world record. Matt was staring at her in bewilderment. \"But why?\" \"Because we have to. I need it, even just for a minute!\" Matt could only gaze at her, perplexed. Final y he said, \"I guess we can ask the kids.\" \"The kids! One of them has got to have a live mobile! Come on, Matt, we have to talk to them right now.\"She stopped and said, rather huskily, \"I pray that you\u0027re right and I\u0027m wrong.\" \"Huh?\"Matt had no idea what was going on. \"I said I pray that I\u0027m wrong! You pray, too, Matt - please!\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-return-midnight-the-vampire-diaries-3/page-32.html","bookId":2037,"book":{"id":2037,"title":"The Return: Midnight (The Vampire Diaries #3)","description":"Storyline: Midnight (The Vampire Diaries: The Return, #3) With the help of charming and devious Damon, Elena rescued her vampire love, Stefan, from the depths of the Dark Dimension.
