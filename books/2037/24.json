{"id":109148,"no":24,"title":"Page 24","content":"Stefan woke early. He spent the time from dawn until breakfast just watching Elena, who even in sleep had an inner glow like a golden flame through a faintly rose-colored candle.\\n\\n At breakfast, everyone was more or less Stillwrapped up in thoughts of the day before. Meredith showed Matt the picture of her brother, Cristian, the vampire. Matt briefly told Meredith about the inner workings of the Ridgemont court system and painted her a picture of Caroline as werewolf. It was clear that both of them felt safer at the boardinghouse than anywhere else.\\n\\n And Elena, who had woken up with Stefan\u0027s mind al around her, embracing her, and her own mind Stillful of light, was completely at a loss for a Plan A or any other letter. She had to be told gently by the others that only one thing made sense.\\n\\n \"Stefan,\"Matt said, draining a mug of Mrs. Flowers\u0027s pitch-black coffee. \"He\u0027s the only one who might be able to use his mind instead of Post-it Notes on the kids.\"\\n\\n And, \"Stefan,\"said Meredith. \"He\u0027s the only one Shinichi might be afraid of.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m no use at all,\"Elena said sadly. She had no appetite. She had gotten dressed with a feeling of love and compassion toward al humankind and a desire to help protect her hometown, but as everyone pointed out, she was probably going to have to spend the day in the root cel ar. Reporters might come to cal .\\n\\n They\u0027re right, Stefan sent to Elena. I\u0027m the only logical person to find out what\u0027s really going on in Fell\u0027s Church.\\n\\n He actual y went while the rest of them were finishing breakfast. Only Elena knew why; only she could feel him at the limits of her telepathic range.\\n\\n Stefan was hunting. He drove into the New Wood, got out, and final y startled a rabbit out of the brush. He Influenced it to rest and not be frightened. Surreptitiously, in this thin woodland without cover, he took a little blood from it...and choked.\\n\\n It tasted like some kind of hideous liquid flavored with rodent.\\n\\n Was a rabbit a rodent? He had been lucky enough to find a rat one day in his prison cel and it had tasted vaguely like this.\\n\\n But now, for days, he had been drinking human blood. Not just that, but the rich, potent blood of strong, adventurous, and in several cases paranormal y talented individuals - the cr��me de la cr��me. How could he have gotten used to it so quickly?\\n\\n It shamed him now, to think of what he\u0027d taken. Elena\u0027s blood, of course, was enough to drive any vampire wild. And Meredith, whose blood had the deep crimson taste of some primordial ocean, and Bonnie, who tasted like a telepath\u0027s dessert. And final y Matt, the Al -American red-blooded boy.\\n\\n They\u0027d fed him and fed him by the hour, far past what he needed to survive. They\u0027d fed him until he\u0027d begun to heal, and seeing that he was healing, they\u0027d fed him more. And it had gone on and on, ending with Elena last night - Elena, whose hair was taking on a silvery cast and whose blue eyes seemed almost radiant. Back in the Dark Dimension, Damon hadn\u0027t exercised any restraint at all. Elena hadn\u0027t exercised any on her own behalf.\\n\\n That silvery cast...Stefan\u0027s stomach clenched when he thought about it, about the last time he\u0027d seen her hair that way. She\u0027d been dead then. On her feet, but dead just the same.\\n\\n Stefan let the rabbit scamper away. He was taking another oath. He must not make Elena into a vampire again. That meant no significant blood exchange between the two of them for at least a week - either giving or taking might tip her over the edge.\\n\\n He must once again adjust to the taste of animal blood.\\n\\n Stefan shut his eyes briefly, remembering the horror of the first time. The cramps. The shakes. The agony that seemed to tel his entire body that it wasn\u0027t getting fed. The feeling that his veins might explode into flame at any moment, and the pain in his jaws.\\n\\n He stood up. He was lucky to be alive. Luckier than he ever could have dreamed he would be in having Elena beside him. He would work through the readjustment without bothering her by tel ing her, he decided.\\n\\n Just two hours later Stefan was back at the boardinghouse, limping slightly. Matt, who met him at the heavy front door, noticed the limp. \"You okay? You\u0027d better get in and ice it.\"\\n\\n \"Just a cramp,\"Stefan said briefly. \"I\u0027m not used to exercise.\\n\\n Didn\u0027t get any back there in - you know.\"He looked away, flushing. So did Matt, hot and cold and furious at the people who had put Stefan in this condition. Vampires were pretty resilient, but he had the feeling - no, he knew - that Stefan had almost died in his prison cel . One day under lock and key had convinced Matt that he never wanted to be imprisoned again.\\n\\n He fol owed Stefan to the kitchen where Elena, Meredith, and Mrs. Flowers were - what else? - drinking mugs of tea.\\n\\n And Matt felt a twinge when Elena instantly noticed the limp and got up and went to Stefan, and Stefan held her tightly, running reassuring fingers through her hair. Matt couldn\u0027t help but wonder, though - was that glorious golden hair turning lighter? More like the silvery gold it had been when Elena had first gone with Stefan and was on her way to turning into a vampire? Stefan certainly seemed to be inspecting it closely, turning each handful as he raked his fingers through it.\\n\\n \"Any luck?\"Elena asked him, tension in her voice.\\n\\n Wearily, Stefan shook his head. \"I went up streets and down streets and wherever I found a - a young girl who was contorted, or whirling round and round, or doing any other of the things the papers mentioned, I tried to Influence them.\\n\\n Well, maybe I shouldn\u0027t have bothered with the whirling girls. I couldn\u0027t catch their eyes. But the final count is zero for eleven.\"\\n\\n Elena turned toward Meredith in agitation. \"What do we do?\"\\n\\n Mrs. Flowers busily began rummaging through bundles of herbs that hung above her stove. \"You need a nice cup of tea.\"\\n\\n \"And a rest,\"Meredith said, patting him lightly on the hand.\\n\\n \"Can I get you anything?\"\\n\\n \"Well - I\u0027ve got a new idea - scrying. But I need Misao\u0027s star bal to see if it wil work. Don\u0027t worry,\"he added, \"I won\u0027t use any of the Power in it; I just need to look at the surface.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027l bring it,\"Elena offered, getting up promptly from where she was sitting on his lap. Matt started slightly and looked at Mrs. Flowers as Elena went to the door of the root cel ar and pushed. Nothing moved and Mrs. Flowers simply watched benignly. It was Stefan who rose to help her, Stilllimping.\\n\\n Then Matt and Meredith got up, Meredith asking, \"Mrs.\\n\\n Flowers, are you sure we should keep the star bal in that same safe?\"\\n\\n \"Ma ma says we\u0027re doing the right thing,\"Mrs. Flowers answered serenely.\\n\\n After that things happened very fast.\\n\\n As if they\u0027d rehearsed it, Meredith pressed the exact place to open the root cel ar door. Elena fel to her hands and knees.\\n\\n Faster than even he had imagined he could go, Matt went barreling toward Stefan with one shoulder down. Mrs.\\n\\n Flowers was frantical y pul ing great swaths of dried herbs down from where they hung above the kitchen table.\\n\\n And then Matt was hitting Stefan with al the power in his body and Stefan was stumbling over Elena, his head going down and down and meeting no resistance on the way.\\n\\n Meredith was coming at him sideways and helping him do a complete forward flip in the air. As soon as the flip took him out of the doorway and he was cartwheeling down the stairs, Elena got up and shut the door and Meredith leaned against it, as Matt shouted, \"How do you keep in a kitsune?\"\\n\\n \"These might help,\"gasped Mrs. Flowers, stuffing odiferous herbs into the crack under the door.\\n\\n \"And - iron!\"cried Elena, and she and Meredith and Matt al ran to the den where there was an enormous, tripartite iron fire screen. Somehow they bundled it back to the kitchen and set it upright against the root cel ar door. Just then the first crash came from the inside against it, but the iron was heavy and the second crash against the door was weaker.\\n\\n \"What are you doing? Have you al gone crazy?\"Stefan shouted plaintively, but as the entire group began to cover the door in Post-it Note amulets, he cursed instead and became pure Shinichi. \"You\u0027ll be sorry, damn you! Misao\u0027s not right. She cries and cries. You\u0027ll make it up to her with your blood, but not before I introduce you to some special friends of mine. The kind who know how to cause real pain!\"\\n\\n Elena lifted her head, as if hearing something. Matt watched her frown. Then she cal ed to Shinichi, \"Don\u0027t even try to probe for Damon. He\u0027s gone. And if you try to track him I\u0027l fry your brains.\"\\n\\n Sul en silence greeted her from the root cel ar.\\n\\n \"My goodness gracious, what next?\"murmured Mrs. Flowers.\\n\\n Elena simply nodded for the others to fol ow her, and they went al the way to the very top of the house - Stefan\u0027s room - and spoke in whispers.\\n\\n \"How did you know?\"\\n\\n \"Did you use telepathy?\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t know at first,\"Matt admitted, \"but Elena was acting as if the star bal was in the root cel ar. Stefan knows it\u0027s not there. I guess,\"he added with a guilty start, \"that I invited him in.\"\\n\\n \"I knew as soon as he started groping my hair,\"Elena said with a shudder. \"Stefan and D - I mean, Stefan knows I only like it touched lightly, and at the ends. Not mauled like that.\\n\\n Remember al Shinichi\u0027s little songs about golden hair? He\u0027s a nutcase. Anyway, I could tel from the feel of his mind.\"\\n\\n Matt felt ashamed. Al his wondering about Elena maybe changing into a vampire...and this was the answer, he thought.\\n\\n \"I noticed his lapis ring,\"Meredith said. \"I saw him with it on his right hand as he went out earlier. When he came back he had it on his left hand.\"\\n\\n There was a brief pause as they al stared at her. She shrugged. \"It was part of my training, noticing little things.\"\\n\\n \"Good point,\"Matt said at last. \"Good point. He wouldn\u0027t be able to change it in sunlight.\"\\n\\n \"How did you know, Mrs. Flowers?\"Elena asked. \"Or was it just the way we were behaving?\"\\n\\n \"Goodness, no, you\u0027re al very good little actors. But as soon as he stepped over the threshold Ma ma fairly shrieked at me: \u0027What are you doing, letting a kitsune into your house?\u0027So then I knew what we were in for.\"\\n\\n \"We beat him!\"Elena said, beaming. \"We actual y caught Shinichi off guard! I can hardly believe it.\"\\n\\n \"Believe it,\"Meredith said with a wry smile. \"He was off guard for a moment. He\u0027l be thinking up revenge right now.\"\\n\\n Something else was worrying Matt. He turned to Elena. \"I thought that you said that both you and Shinichi had keys that could take you anywhere, anytime. So why couldn\u0027t he have just said, \u0027Take me inside the boardinghouse where the star bal is\u0027?\"\\n\\n \"Those were different keys from the Twin Fox key,\"Elena said, her brows drawn together. \"They\u0027re, like, the Master Keys and Shinichi and Misao Stillhave them both. I don\u0027t know why he didn\u0027t use his. Although it would have given him away the moment he was inside.\"\\n\\n \"Not if he went inside the root cel ar, and stayed there the whole time,\"Meredith said. \"And maybe a Master Key can override the \u0027not invited inside\u0027rule.\"\\n\\n Mrs. Flowers said, \"But Ma ma Stillwould have told me. Also there are no keyholes in the root cel ar. at all.\"\\n\\n \"\u0027No keyholes\u0027wouldn\u0027t matter, I don\u0027t think,\"Elena answered.\\n\\n \"I think he just wanted to show how clever he was, and how he could fool us into giving him Misao\u0027s star bal .\"\\n\\n Before anyone else could say a word, Meredith held out her palm, with a shining key on it. The key was golden with diamonds inset and had a very familiar outline.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s one of the Master Keys!\"cried Elena. \"It\u0027s what we thought the Twin Fox key would look like!\"\\n\\n \"It sort of came out of his jeans pocket when he did that flip,\"Meredith said innocently.\\n\\n \"When you were flipping him over me, you mean,\"said Elena.\\n\\n \"I suppose you picked his pocket too.\"\\n\\n \"So, right now, Shinichi doesn\u0027t have a key to escape with!\"Matt said excitedly.\\n\\n \"No key to make keyholes,\"Elena agreed, dimpling.\\n\\n \"He can have fun changing into a mole and burrowing out of the root cel ar,\"Meredith said cool y. \"That\u0027s if he\u0027s got his transforming gear or whatever with him.\"She added, with a troubled change in her voice, \"I wonder...if we should have Matt tel one other person where he\u0027s actual y hidden the star bal . Just...Well, just in case.\"\\n\\n Matt saw knitted brows al around him. But suddenly the realization hit him that he had to tel someone that he\u0027d hidden the star bal in his closet. The group - including Stefan - had picked him to hide it because he had so stubbornly resisted when Shinichi was using Damon\u0027s body as a puppet to torture him a month ago. Matt had proved then that he would die in hideous pain rather than endanger his friends. But if Matt were to die now, Misao\u0027s star bal might be lost to the group forever. And only Matt knew how close he had come today to tumbling down the stairs along with Shinichi.\\n\\n Far below they al heard a shout. \"Hel o! Is anybody home? Elena!\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s my Stefan,\"Elena said and then, without a shred of dignity, she ran to launch herself from the foyer into his arms.\\n\\n He looked startled, but managed to break her fal before they both went down on the porch.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s been going on?\"he said, his body vibrating infinitesimal y, as with the urge to fight. \"The whole house smel s like kitsune!\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s All right,\"Elena said. \"Come and see.\"She led him upstairs to his room. \"We\u0027ve got him in the root cel ar,\"she added.\\n\\n Stefan looked confused. \"You\u0027ve got who in the root cel ar?\"\\n\\n \"With iron against the door,\"Matt said triumphantly. \"And herbs and amulets al over it. And, anyway, Meredith got his key.\"\\n\\n \"His key? You\u0027re talking about - Shinichi?\"Stefan turned on Meredith, green eyes wide. \"While I\u0027ve been gone?\"\\n\\n \"It was mostly an accident. I sort of stuck my hand in his pocket when he was upside down and off balance. And I lucked out and got the Master Key - unless this is an ordinary house key.\"\\n\\n Stefan stared at it. \"It\u0027s the real thing. Elena knows that.\\n\\n Meredith, you\u0027re incredible!\"\\n\\n \"Yes, it\u0027s the right one,\"Elena confirmed. \"I remember the shape - pretty elaborate, yes?\"She took it from Meredith\u0027s hand.\\n\\n \"What are you going to - \"\\n\\n \"Might as well test it,\"Elena said with a mischievous smile.\\n\\n She walked to the door of the room, shut it, said, \"The den downstairs,\"inserted the winged key in the lock, and opened the door, stepping through and shutting the door behind her.\\n\\n Before anyone could speak, she was back, with the poker from the den held aloft in triumph.\\n\\n \"It works!\"Stefan cried.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s amazing,\"Matt said.\\n\\n Stefan looked almost feverish. \"But don\u0027t you realize what it means? It means we can use this key. We can go anywhere we like without using Power. Even to the Dark Dimension!\\n\\n But first - while he\u0027s Stillhere - we ought to do something about Shinichi.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re in no condition to do that now, dear Stefan,\"Mrs.\\n\\n Flowers said, shaking her head. \"I\u0027m sorry, but the truth is that we have been very, very lucky. That wicked kitsune was off guard back then. He won\u0027t be now.\"\\n\\n \"I Stillhave to try,\"Stefan said quietly. \"Every one of you has been tormented or had to fight - whether with your fists or your minds,\"he added, bowing slightly to Mrs. Flowers. \"I\u0027ve suffered but I\u0027ve never had a chance to fight him. I have to try.\"\\n\\n Matt said, just as quietly, \"I\u0027l go with you.\"\\n\\n Elena added, \"We can al fight together. Right, Meredith?\"\\n\\n Meredith nodded slowly, taking Stefan\u0027s poker from his fireplace. \"Yes. It may be a low blow, but - together.\"\\n\\n \"I say it\u0027s a higher blow than letting him live and go on hurting people. Anyway, we\u0027l take care of it...together,\"Elena said firmly. \"Right now!\"\\n\\n Matt started to get up, but his motion was frozen in midair as he stared in horror. Simultaneously, with the grace of hunting lionesses or bal et dancers the two girls closed in on Stefan, and simultaneously they swung their separate pokers; Elena hitting him in the head and Meredith hitting him squarely in the groin. Stefan reeled away from the blow to the head, but simply said, \"Ow!\"when Meredith hit him. Matt knocked Elena out of the way and then, turning as precisely as if he were on the footbal field, got Meredith out of \"Stefan\u0027s\"way too.\\n\\n But this imposter had obviously decided not to fight back.\\n\\n Stefan\u0027s form melted. Misao, green leaves woven into her scarlet-tipped black hair, stood before them. To Matt\u0027s shock, her face was pinched and pale. She was obviously very il , although Stilldefiant. But there was no mockery in her voice tonight.\\n\\n \"What have you done with my star bal ? And my brother?\"she demanded feebly.\\n\\n \"Your brother\u0027s safely locked up,\"Matt said, hardly knowing what he was tel ing her. Despite al the crimes Misao had committed he couldn\u0027t help feeling sorry for her. She was clearly desperate and il .\\n\\n \"I know that. I was going to say my brother wil kil you al - not as a game, but in anger.\"Now Misao looked wretched and frightened. \"You\u0027ve never seen him really angry.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve never seen Stefan angry either,\"Elena said. \"At least not when he had al his Power.\"\\n\\n Misao just shook her head. A dried leaf floated from her hair.\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t understand!\"\\n\\n \"I doubt we understand anything. Meredith, have we searched this girl?\"\\n\\n \"No, but surely she wouldn\u0027t have brought the other one - \"\\n\\n Elena said crisply, \"Matt, take a book and read it. I\u0027l tel you when we\u0027re done.\"\\n\\n Matt was reluctant to turn his back on a kitsune, even a sick one. But when even Mrs. Flowers nodded gently he obeyed.\\n\\n Still, back turned or not, he could hear noises. And the noises suggested that Misao was being held tightly and searched thoroughly. At first the sounds were al negative murmurs.\\n\\n \"Huh-uh...huh-uh...huh-uh...huh- oops!\"There was a rattle of metal on wood.\\n\\n Matt only turned when Elena said, \"Okay, you can look. It was in her front pocket.\"She added to Misao, who was looking as if she might faint, \"We didn\u0027t want to have to hold you and search you. But this key - where in heaven\u0027s name did you get keys like this, anyway?\"\\n\\n A pink spot showed on Misao\u0027s cheeks. \"Heaven is right.\\n\\n They\u0027re the only two left of the Master Keys - and they belong to Shinichi and me. I figured out how to steal them from the Celestial Court. That was...a long time ago.\"\\n\\n At that moment they heard a car on the road - Stefan\u0027s Porsche. In the dead silence that fol owed, they could also see the car through Stefan\u0027s window as it swung into the driveway.\\n\\n \"No one goes down,\"Elena said tersely. \"No one invites him in.\"\\n\\n Meredith shot her a keen glance. \"Shinichi could have tunneled out like a mole by now. And he\u0027s already been invited in.\"\\n\\n \"My fault for not warning you al - but anyway, if it is Shinichi and he\u0027s done anything to hurt Stefan he\u0027s going to see me when I\u0027m angry. The words Wings of Destruction just popped into my head and something inside me wants to say them.\"\\n\\n There was a chil in the room.\\n\\n No one met Stefan, but in a moment they could al hear running footsteps. Stefan appeared at his door, burst through, and found himself confronted with a row of people al looking at him suspiciously.\\n\\n \"What the hell is going on?\"he demanded, staring at Misao, who was being held up between Meredith and Matt. \"Misao - \"\\n\\n Elena took two steps toward him - and wound herself around him, drawing him into a deep kiss. For a moment he resisted, but then, bit by bit, his opposition col apsed despite the roomful of observers.\\n\\n When Elena final y let go, she just leaned against Stefan, breathing hard. The others were al crimson with embarrassment. Stefan, flushed as he was, held her tightly.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\"Elena whispered. \"But you\u0027ve already \u0027come home\u0027twice. First, it was Shinichi and we locked him in the root cel ar. Then it was her.\"She pointed, without looking, toward the cowering Misao. \"I didn\u0027t know how to make sure that Shinichi hadn\u0027t escaped somehow - \"\\n\\n \"And you\u0027re sure now?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, yes. I recognize you. You\u0027re always ready to let me in.\"\\n\\n Matt realized that she was shaking and quickly stood up so she could sit, for at least a minute or two, in peace.\\n\\n The peace lasted less than a minute.\\n\\n \"I want my star bal !\"Misao cried. \"I need to put Power in it or I\u0027l go on weakening - and then you\u0027l have murdered me.\"\\n\\n \"Go on weakening? Is the liquid evaporating out of the star bal or something?\"Meredith asked. Matt was thinking about what he\u0027d seen on his home block before the Ridgemont sheriffs had got him.\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve gathered Power to put in it?\"he asked mildly. \"Power from yesterday, maybe?\"\\n\\n \"Power from ever since you took it. But it isn\u0027t joined with...\\n\\n me. With my star bal . It\u0027s mine, but not yet.\"\\n\\n \"Like maybe some Power from making Cole Reece eat his guinea pig while it was alive? From making kids burn down their own houses?\"Matt\u0027s voice was gravel y.\\n\\n \"What does it matter?\"Misao retorted sul enly. \"It\u0027s mine.\\n\\n They were my ideas, not yours. You can\u0027t keep me away - \"\\n\\n \"Meredith, keep me away from her. I\u0027ve known that kid Cole since he was born. I\u0027l always have nightmares...\"\\n\\n Misao perked up like a wilting plant getting water. \"Have nightmares, have nightmares,\"she whispered.\\n\\n There was a silence. Then Meredith said, careful y and expressionlessly, as if she were thinking of the stave, \"You\u0027re a nasty little thing, aren\u0027t you? Is that your food? Bad memories, nightmares, fear of the future?\"\\n\\n Misao was plainly stumped. She couldn\u0027t see the catch. It was like asking a regular hungry teenager \"How about some pizza and a Coke? Is that what you want?\"Misao couldn\u0027t even see that her appetites were wrong, so she couldn\u0027t lie.\\n\\n \"You were right before,\"Stefan said forceful y. \"We have your star bal . The only way to make us give it back would be to do something for us. We\u0027re supposed to be able to control you anyway because we have it - \"\\n\\n \"Old-ways thinking. Obsolete,\"Misao growled.\\n\\n There was a dead silence. Matt felt his stomach plummet.\\n\\n They had been betting on \"old-ways thinking\"al along. To get Shinichi\u0027s star bal by making Misao tel them where it was.\\n\\n Their ultimate goal had been to control Shinichi using his star bal .\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t understand,\"Misao said, pitiful y and yet angrily at the same time. \"My brother wil help me fil my star bal again.\\n\\n But what we did in this town - it was an order, not just for fun.\"\\n\\n \"Could\u0027a fooled me,\"Elena murmured, but Stefan\u0027s head jerked up and he said, \"An order? From who?\"\\n\\n \"I...don\u0027t...know!\" Misao screamed. \"Shinichi gets the orders.\\n\\n Then he tel s me what to do. But whoever it is should be happy by now. The town is almost destroyed. He ought to give me some help here!\"She glared at the group, and they stared back.\\n\\n Without knowing that he was going to say it, Matt said, \"Let\u0027s put her in the root cel ar with Shinichi. I\u0027ve got this feeling that we might al be sleeping in the storage room tonight.\"\\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-return-midnight-the-vampire-diaries-3/page-24.html","bookId":2037,"book":{"id":2037,"title":"The Return: Midnight (The Vampire Diaries #3)","description":"Storyline: Midnight (The Vampire Diaries: The Return, #3) \\n With the help of charming and devious Damon, Elena rescued her vampire love, Stefan, from the depths of the Dark Dimension.
