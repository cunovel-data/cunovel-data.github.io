{"id":109155,"no":31,"title":"Page 31","content":"Elena woke up feeling stiff and cramped. But that wasn\u0027t surprising. Three other people seemed to be on top of her.\n Elena? Can you hear me?\n Stefan?\n Yes! You\u0027re awake?\n I\u0027m all cramped...and hot.\n A different voice interrupted. Just give us a moment and you won\u0027t be cramped anymore. Elena felt Damon move away. Bonnie rol ed into his place.\n But Stefan clung to her for a moment. Elena, I\u0027m sorry. I never even realized what condition you were in. Thank God for Damon. Can you forgive me?\n Despite the heat, Elena cuddled closer to him. If you can forgive me for putting the whole party in danger. I did that, didn\u0027t I?\n I don\u0027t know. I don\u0027t care. All I know is that I love you.\n It was several minutes before Bonnie woke up. Then she said feebly, \"Hey! Whachoo doin\u0027in my bed?\"\n \"Getting out of it,\"Elena said, and tried to rol over and get up.\n The world was wobbly. She was wobbly - and bruised. But Stefan was never more than a few inches away, holding her, righting her when she started to fal . He helped her get dressed without making her feel like a baby. He examined her backpack, which fortunately hadn\u0027t gone into the water, and then he took out anything heavy inside. He put the heavy things in his own pack.\n Elena felt much better after being given some food, and after seeing the thurgs - both of them - eating too; either stretching their great double trunks up to break off pieces of wood from the barren trees, or scooping away snow to find dry grass underneath. They clearly were not going to die after al .\n Elena knew everyone was watching her to gauge whether or not she was up to any more that day. She hurried to finish drinking the tea heated over a dung fire, trying to conceal the fact that her hands shook. After forcing some jerky down, she said in her most cheerful voice, \"So what next?\"\n How do you feel? Stefan asked her.\n \"Little sore, but I\u0027l be fine. I guess everyone expects me to have pneumonia, but I don\u0027t even have any cough.\"\n Damon, after one heavy-lidded glance at Stefan, took both her hands and stared at her. She couldn\u0027t - she didn\u0027t dare -\n meet his eyes, so she focused on Stefan, who was looking at her comfortingly.\n At last Damon dropped Elena\u0027s hands abruptly. \"I went in as far as I could. You should know how far that is,\"he added to Stefan. \"She\u0027s sound, her nose is wet, and her coat is shiny.\"\n Stefan looked as if he were going to smack him one, but Elena took his hand soothingly. \"I\u0027m healthy,\"she said. \"So that\u0027s two votes for me going on to save Fel \u0027s Church.\"\n \"I\u0027ve always believed in you,\"Stefan said. \"If you think you can go on, you can go on.\"\n Bonnie sniffled. \"Just don\u0027t take any more chances, okay?\"she said. \"You scared me.\"\n \"I\u0027m real y sorry,\"Elena said gently, feeling the void of Meredith\u0027s absence. Meredith would be a great help to both of them now. \"So, shal we continue? And where are we heading? I\u0027m al turned around.\"\n Damon stood. \"I think we just keep in a straight line. The path is narrow after this - and who knows what the next trial is?\"\n The path was narrow - and misty. Just as before, it started in filmy veils and ended up blinding them. Elena let Stefan, with his catlike reflexes, go first, and she held on to his pack.\n Behind her, Bonnie clung like a burr. Just when Elena thought she was going to scream if she had to keep traveling through the white blanket any farther, it cleared.\n They were near the top of some mountain.\n Elena took off after Bonnie, who had hurried ahead at the sight of transparent air. She was just fast enough to grab on to Bonnie\u0027s pack and pul her backward as she reached the place where the land stopped.\n \"No way!\"Bonnie cried, setting up a clamoring echo from below. \"There is no way I\u0027m going across that!\"\n That was a chasm with a very thin bridge spanning it.\n The chasm was frosty white on either side at the top, but when Elena gripped the bridge\u0027s ice-cold metal poles and leaned a little forward she could see glacial blues and greens at the very bottom. A chil wind hit her face.\n The gap between this bit of the world and the next bit directly in front of them was about a hundred yards long.\n Elena looked from the shadowy depths to the slender bridge, which was made of wooden slats and just wide enough for one person to walk on. It was supported here and there by ropes which ran to the sides of the chasm and were sunk with metal posts into barren, icy rock.\n It also swooped magnificently down and then back up again.\n Even looking at it gave the eye a sort of mini�Cthril ride. The only problem was that it didn\u0027t include a safety belt, a seat, two handrails, and a uniformed guide saying, \"Hands and feet must be kept inside the attraction at alltimes!\"It did have a single, thin, creeper-woven rope to hold on to on the left.\n \"Look,\"Stefan was saying, as quietly and intently as Elena had ever heard him speak, \"we can hold onto each other. We can go go one by one, very slowly - \"\n \"NOOO!\" Bonnie put into that one word a psychic shriek that almost defeaned Elena. \"No, no, no, no, NO! You don\u0027t understand! I can\u0027t DO IT!\" She flung her backpack down.\n Then she began laughing and crying at the same time in a ful -blown attack of hysterics. Elena had an impulse to dash water in her face. She had a stronger impulse to throw herself down beside Bonnie and shriek, \"And neither can I!\n It\u0027s insane!\"But what good would that do?\n A few minutes later Damon was talking quietly to Bonnie, unaffected by the outburst. Stefan was pacing in circles.\n Elena was trying to think of Plan A, while a little voice chanted inside her head, You can\u0027t do it, you can\u0027t do it, you can\u0027t do it, either.\n This was al just a phobia. They could probably train Bonnie out of it - if, say, they had a year or two.\n Stefan, on one of his circular trips near her, said, \"And how are you about heights, love?\"\n Elena decided to put a brave face on it. \"I don\u0027t know. I think I can do it.\"\n Stefan looked pleased. \"To save your hometown.\"\n \"Yes...but it\u0027s too bad nothing works here. I could try to use my Wings for flying, but I can\u0027t control them - \"\n And that kind of magic is simply not available here, Stefan\u0027s voice said in her mind.\n But telepathy is. You can hear me, too, can\u0027t you?\n They thought of the answer simultaneously, and Elena saw the light of the idea breaking on Stefan\u0027s face even as she began to speak.\n \"Influence Bonnie! Make her think she\u0027s a tightrope walker -\n a performer since she was a toddler. But don\u0027t make her too playful so she doesn\u0027t bounce the rest of us off!\"\n With that light in his face, Stefan looked...too good. He seized both Elena\u0027s hands, whirled her around once as if she weighed nothing, picked her up, and kissed her.\n And kissed her.\n And kissed her until Elena felt her soul dripping off her fingertips.\n They shouldn\u0027t have done it in front of Damon. But Elena\u0027s euphoria was clouding her judgment, and she couldn\u0027t control herself.\n Neither of them had been trying for a deep mind probe. But telepathy was al they had left, and it was warm and wonderful and it left them for an instant in the circle of each other\u0027s arms, laughing, panting - with electricity flashing between them. Elena\u0027s whole body felt as if she\u0027d just gotten a sizable jolt.\n Then she pul ed herself out of his arms, but it was too late.\n Their shared gaze had gone on much too long, and Elena felt her heart pounding in fear. She could feel Damon\u0027s eyes on her. She barely managed to whisper, \"Wil you tel them?\"\n \"Yes,\"Stefan said softly. \"I\u0027l tel them.\"But he didn\u0027t move until she actual y turned her back on Bonnie and Damon.\n After that she peeked over her shoulder and listened.\n Stefan sat down by the sobbing girl and said, \"Bonnie, can you look at me? That\u0027s al I want. I promise you, you don\u0027t have to go across that bridge if you don\u0027t want to. You don\u0027t even have to stop crying, but try to look me in the eye. Can you do that? Good. Now...\"His voice and even his face changed subtly, becoming more forceful - mesmerizing.\n \"You\u0027re not afraid of heights at all, are you? You\u0027re an acrobat who could walk a tightrope across the Grand Canyon and never turn a hair. You\u0027re the very best of al your family, the flying McCul oughs, and they\u0027re the best in the world. And right now, you\u0027re going to choose whether to cross over that wooden bridge. If so, you\u0027l lead us. You\u0027l be our leader.\"\n Slowly, while listening to Stefan, Bonnie\u0027s face had changed.\n With swol en eyes fixed on Stefan\u0027s, she seemed to be listening intently to something in her own head. And final y, as Stefan said the last sentence, she jumped up and looked at the bridge.\n \"Okay, let\u0027s go!\"she cried, picking up her backpack, while Elena sat staring after her.\n \"Can you make it?\"Stefan asked, looking at Elena. \"We\u0027l let her go first - there\u0027s real y no way she can fal off. I\u0027l go after her. Elena can come after me and hold on to my belt, and I\u0027m counting on you, Damon, to hold on to her. Especial y if she starts to faint.\"\n \"I\u0027l hold her,\"Damon said quietly. Elena wanted to ask Stefan to Influence her, too, but everything was happening so fast.\n Bonnie was already on the bridge, only pausing when cal ed back by Stefan. Stefan was looking behind him at Elena, saying, \"Can you get a good grip?\"Damon was behind Elena, putting a strong hand on her shoulder, and saying,\n \"Look straight ahead, not down. Don\u0027t worry about fainting; I\u0027l catch you.\"\n But it was such a frail wooden bridge, and Elena found that she was always looking down and her stomach floated up outside her body and above her head. She had a death-grip on Stefan\u0027s belt with one hand, and on the woven creeper with the other.\n They came to a place where a slat had detached and the slats on either side looked as if they might go at any moment.\n \"Careful with these!\"Bonnie said, laughing and leaping over al three.\n Stefan stepped over the first chancy slat, over the missing one, and put his foot on the next.\n Crack!\n Elena didn\u0027t scream - she was beyond screaming. She couldn\u0027t look. The sound had shut her eyes.\n And she couldn\u0027t move. Not a finger. Certainly not a foot.\n She felt Damon\u0027s arms around her waist. Both of them. She wanted to let him support her weight as he had many times before.\n But Damon was whispering to her, words like spel s that allowed her legs to stop shaking and cramping and even let her stop breathing so fast that she might faint. And then he was lifting her and Stefan\u0027s arms were going around her and for a moment they were both holding her firmly. Then Stefan took her weight and gently put her feet down on firm slats.\n Elena wanted to cling to him like a koala, but she knew that she mustn\u0027t. She would make them both fal . So somewhere, from inner depths she didn\u0027t know she had, she found the courage to take her own weight on her feet and fumbled for the creeper.\n Then she lifted her head and whispered as loudly as she could, \"Go on. We need to give Damon room.\"\n \"Yes,\"Stefan whispered back. But he kissed her on the forehead, a quick protective kiss, before he turned and stepped toward the impatient Bonnie.\n Behind her, Elena heard - and felt - Damon jumping catlike over the gap.\n Elena raised her eyes to stare at the back of Stefan\u0027s head again. She couldn\u0027t compass al the emotions she was feeling at that moment: love, terror, awe, excitement - and, of course, gratitude, al at once.\n She didn\u0027t dare turn her head to look at Damon behind her, but she felt exactly the same things for him.\n \"A few more steps,\"he kept saying. \"A few more steps.\"\n A brief eternity later, they were on solid ground, facing a medium-sized cavern, and Elena fel to her knees. She was sick and faint, but she tried to thank Damon as he passed by her on the snowy mountain trail.\n \"You were in my way,\"he said shortly and as coldly as the wind. \"If you had fal en you might have upset the entire bridge. And I don\u0027t happen to feel like dying today.\"\n \"What are you saying to her? What did you just say?\"Stefan, who had been out of earshot, came hurrying back. \"What did he say to you?\"\n Damon, examining his palm for creeper thorns, said without looking up, \"I told her the truth, that\u0027s al . So far she\u0027s zero for two on this quest. Let\u0027s hope that as long as you make it through they let you in the Gatehouse, because if they\u0027re grading on performance we\u0027ve flunked. Or should I say, one of us has flunked?\"\n \"Shut up or I\u0027ll shut you up,\" Stefan said in a different voice than Elena had ever heard him use before. She stared. It was as if he\u0027d grown ten years in one second. \"Don\u0027t you ever talk to her or about her that way again, Damon!\"\n Damon stared at him for a moment, pupils contracted. Then he said, \"Whatever,\"and strol ed away.\n Stefan bent down to hold Elena until her shaking stopped.\n And that\u0027s that, Elena thought. An ice-cold rage gripped her.\n Damon had no respect for her at all; he had none for anyone but himself. She couldn\u0027t protect Bonnie from Bonnie\u0027s own feelings - or stop him from insulting her. She couldn\u0027t stop Bonnie for forgiving. But she, Elena, was done with Damon.\n This last insult was the end.\n The fog came in again as they walked through the cavern. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-return-midnight-the-vampire-diaries-3/page-31.html","bookId":2037,"book":{"id":2037,"title":"The Return: Midnight (The Vampire Diaries #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Midnight (The Vampire Diaries: The Return, #3) \n With the help of charming and devious Damon, Elena rescued her vampire love, Stefan, from the depths of the Dark Dimension.
