She’s old.” “Does she have friends?” Hale asked. “Friends who could help her steal an emerald ?” Kelly laughed as if it were the funniest thing he’d heard in ages. “I think not.” “Family?” “Yes. A grandson, I think.” “Does she have a claim, sir?” Kelly scoffed. “Not a legitimate one. The best courts in two countries have said so for a dozen years.” “Twelve years is a long time to want something, Mr. Kelly.” “Yes, but—” “A very long time to hear no.” But no was not a word that Oliver Kelly the Third had ever heard. To hear it for a dozen years seemed more than the young man could understand. Kelly dropped his voice and finished, “Perhaps I should have my secretary put together a file.” “Yes.” Hale smiled. “Perhaps you should.” “Excuse me, miss. May I help you?” Kat didn’t turn at the question. Two feet away, there was a case full of rubies and diamonds—a pendant rumored to have belonged to Catherine the Great and a pair of earrings featured in a movie starring Audrey Hepburn. But those things didn’t really matter to Kat. Kat was far more concerned about the one case that was empty. “What goes in here?” she asked the salesman. “Oh, I’m afraid that space is reserved for a very special—Don’t do that,” the man said when Kat propped one hand on the case (and fingered the hydraulic base and titanium stand with the other). “But what is it?” Kat chomped her gum. “I might want to buy it, you know. I’ve got a birthday coming up, and my dad said I could pick out anything I want. Maybe I want what goes in here.” She tapped the glass (and surmised that it was drill-proof and at least an inch thick). “I’m afraid it isn’t for sale.” Kat rolled her eyes (and noted the positions of the surveillance cameras on the north wall). “Then what’s it doing in a store if it’s not for sale?” “We are an auction house, young lady, and this is an exhibition piece that will be displayed until—Please don’t do that,” the man said, grabbing Kat’s hand just as she reached beneath the case’s edge, fingering the pressure-sensitive lip of the pedestal. “Excuse me,” Kat said when she bumped into a man who was browsing among the cases (and felt the telltale shoulder holster of a plainclothes guard). “Miss,” the salesman went on, “perhaps you would be more interested in our collection of—” “So you’re just going to show it off?” Kat scanned the gleaming showroom floor (and noticed the state-of-the-art motion sensors at the pedestal’s base). “Yes, we are—” “That doesn’t seem very fair,” Kat huffed. She took one last look around the room, at the guards and the cameras, the exits and the case, and then turned to leave. “Miss,” the salesman called, “I am sure there are many other things that will work with your price range.” He swept his arm around the showroom floor. “That’s okay.” In the corner of the room, an antique clock began to chime. “I think I’ve got everything I need.” “You’re late.” Kat felt her cousin fall into step beside her, but didn’t turn to look. She was probably the only person on the street that day not staring at the slender girl in the short trench coat and tall black boots, but that didn’t really matter. Gabrielle pointed to the Kelly catalog in Kat’s hands. “So can we do it?” Kat took a deep breath and shoved the thin book into her pocket. “Right now, I’m more worried about whether or not we should do it.” She eyed her cousin. “You got the key?” Gabrielle rolled her eyes and flashed a small magnetic card from a hotel near Times Square. “Of course I got the key.” They could have picked the lock, rappelled down from the roof—maybe swiped a couple of maid uniforms and a housekeeping cart for good measure—but Kat and Gabrielle were smart enough to know that the shortest distance between two points was always a straight line. Or a picked pocket, as the case may be. So they made their way into the hotel lobby and elevator without any fanfare or unnecessary risk. They were just two girls on their own in the big city—all the way to the small, modest room on the alley side of the seventh floor. “So how was your day, Gabrielle?” Kat asked. “Do you have any idea how hard it is to tail an eightyyear-old woman? It’s hard. Really hard. Really…slow.” Then Gabrielle raised a fist and knocked. “Housekeeping?” she called while Kat stood just out of view. “Housekeeping!” she tried again. After a long quiet beat, she used the key, and together the cousins stepped inside. For all the hotel rooms that Kat had seen in her short life, she couldn’t remember the last time she’d been in one like that. It consisted of nothing more than two full beds, a clean small bath, a bureau, and one closet with hangers permanently attached to the rod. “Well, they travel like they’re almost out of money,” Gabrielle said, moving through the room so quickly and softly that Kat doubted her feet even made an impression in the carpet. “How much time do we have?” Kat asked. “They just went in with their lawyer, so let’s call it forty minutes.” “Let’s call it thirty,” Kat countered, and Gabrielle shrugged—the universal signal for Have it your way. It didn’t really matter. They could have done what they needed to do in ten. There was only the bedroom and bathroom, after all. The closet held two suitcases that had probably been quite expensive fifty years before but were now faded and beaten; three pairs of shoes and an assortment clothes that were worn but neatly mended—all with London labels. “Found the safe,” Gabrielle called from the cabinet that held the minibar. Inside was a small box that was standard issue for hotel chains around the world, so it only took a minute for Kat to crack it. A moment later, she was pulling out two passports in the names of Marshall and Constance Miller. Two hundred dollars in traveler’s checks. A family locket. And a beaten, weathered file about a very famous emerald and an almost-as-notorious court case. Kat watched her cousin flip through page after page—black-and-white images of a family in the desert; photocopies of ancient ledgers written in a woman’s elegant hand. And countless letters from Oliver Kelly the Third, urging Constance Miller to “move on,” “give up,” and finally, “get a real hobby.” “Oh,” Gabrielle said slowly, “I really don’t like this guy.” But it was the last page that made them stop—because it was the last page where someone had taped a plain white business card with simple black letters that spelled the name Visily Romani. CHAPTER 8 An hour later, Kat was alone in the middle of Madison Square Park, watching the fat white flakes that floated between the gray sky and the Kelly building—a nagging voice in the back of her mind telling her that something was about to go terribly wrong. Maybe it was the location: high-security buildings are hard. High-security high-rises are suicide. Perhaps it was because the Kelly Corporation’s cameras were state-of-the-art, and their security consultants used to cash paychecks from places like the CIA. It was not because of curses. It was not because of Hale. It was certainly not because Visily Romani—no matter how noble his motives—was developing an annoying habit of pulling Kat into jobs that far older and experienced (and some might even say sane) thieves would never dare attempt. No—Kat shook her head against the thought, blinked away the snow that landed on her dark lashes—that wasn’t it. “If I didn’t know any better,” a strong voice said from behind her, “I’d say you were casing that joint.” Hale was there. Kat turned to see Gabrielle punch his arm and say, “Told you we’d find her here.” But there was nothing playful in the way Hale was looking at her as he said, “I should probably warn you that Oliver Kelly isn’t messing around.” And that was when Kat knew there was no single part of this job that worried her—it was everything together. From the building, to the target, to the way Hale crossed his arms and studied her through the falling snow. But most of all, there was… “Romani.” Kat looked up at the gray sky. “They had Romani’s card.” She stood waiting for an answer of some kind, but got nothing. “So it’s legit. So I think I’ve got to do this.” She studied Hale through the falling snow. “So…say something.” “That place is a fortress, Kat.” “Romani wouldn’t have sent Constance Miller to me if he didn’t think I could—” “We,” Hale snapped. “Of course. If he didn’t think we could do it.” “I don’t like it, Kat,” Hale said, and just that quickly, Kat knew he was right. “I don’t like it either, but I think…I think I’ve got to try. You don’t have to come with me if you—” “No.” Hale shook his head. “No way. If you’re in, I’m in.” Together, the two of them turned to Gabrielle, who plopped onto a park bench and crossed her legs. “So what do we know?” She stared at the building in the distance as if trying to move it through the sheer power of her mind. It might have worked, too, if Hale hadn’t stepped in front of her. “The stone arrives Thursday from Switzerland via private charter. It will go immediately to the tenth floor, where it will be polished, verified, and appraised.” “How long?” Kat asked. Hale shrugged. “If they’re not distracted, I’d say three hours. Maybe less.” Gabrielle looked at Kat. “Didn’t the Wobbley Brothers do Humpty Dumpty once in three hours?” “Maybe less,” Hale said again, even louder. “And it’s cursed,” Gabrielle chimed in. “What?” she asked when Kat gave her a look. “I’m just saying we should never underestimate curses.” “What about transit?” Kat asked, ignoring her. Hale shook his head. “They’ve got three different armored car companies with three different routes, and that morning they’ll flip a coin to see which one gets the job. Plus, once it’s in transit, there’s…you know…an armored truck. And guards. With guns.” “The Bagshaws blew up an armored truck once,” Gabrielle offered. “And guards.” Hale’s voice rose even more. “What’s the first floor like?” he asked, but Kat was already shaking her head.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/uncommon-criminals-heist-society-2/page-6.html","bookId":2404,"book":{"id":2404,"title":"Uncommon Criminals (Heist Society #2)","description":"Storyline: Uncommon Criminals (Heist Society #2) Katarina Bishop has worn a lot of labels in her short life. Friend. Niece. Daughter. Thief. But for the last two months she’s simply been known as the girl who ran the crew that robbed the greatest museum in the world. That’s why Kat isn’t surprised when she’s asked to steal the infamous Cleopatra Emerald so it can be returned to its rightful owners. There are only three problems. First, the gem hasn’t been seen in public in thirty years.

But it’s the third problem that makes Kat’s crew the most nervous and that is simply… the emerald is cursed. Kat might be in way over her head, but she’s not going down without a fight. After all she has her best friend—the gorgeous Hale—and the rest of her crew with her as they chase the Cleopatra around the globe, dodging curses, realizing that the same tricks and cons her family has used for centuries are useless this time.
