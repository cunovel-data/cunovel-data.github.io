Kat looked down at her lemonade. “Do you think he betrayed the love of his life…because of us?” “She used the name Romani, Kat,” was Gabrielle’s answer. “And besides…” She let the words draw out. Her gaze went to the distance, and there was a sense of peace in the way she said, “We’re the love of his life.” She raised her glass again. “To family.” This time Kat couldn’t help but join in. “So isn’t it time for the…” Hale started, but trailed off when, half a block away, a loud explosion sounded and a spiral of black smoke billowed up, temporarily blocking out the sky. “Yep,” Kat said. “And your dad’s sure the organized crime ring that’s sitting on this stash doesn’t know its real value?” Hale asked, concerned. “Well, we’re about to find out,” Kat said as a man ran to the fountain, then called in rapid Spanish that he needed all available hands at the back of the church. “Wow. Uncle Felix’s leg is doing a lot better.” “Yeah.” Gabrielle gave an enthusiastic nod. “He’s getting around really well.” There was chaos on the square as people yelled and smoke rose, but the three teens sat quietly, waiting, as Uncle Eddie climbed into the truck and drove away. “So,” Hale said, watching the smoke rise and the Bagshaws run. “Where to now?” Kat stood and downed her drink in one swallow, set the glass back on the table, and turned into the sun. “Well, see, there’s this cave in Switzerland I really need to find.” She slipped on her sunglasses; was already in the middle of the street when she turned and looked back at Hale and Gabrielle. “You coming?”","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/uncommon-criminals-heist-society-2/page-34.html","bookId":2404,"book":{"id":2404,"title":"Uncommon Criminals (Heist Society #2)","description":"Storyline: Uncommon Criminals (Heist Society #2) Katarina Bishop has worn a lot of labels in her short life. Friend. Niece. Daughter. Thief. But for the last two months she’s simply been known as the girl who ran the crew that robbed the greatest museum in the world. That’s why Kat isn’t surprised when she’s asked to steal the infamous Cleopatra Emerald so it can be returned to its rightful owners. There are only three problems. First, the gem hasn’t been seen in public in thirty years. Second, since the fall of the Egyptian empire and the suicide of Cleopatra, no one who holds the emerald keeps it for long, and in Kat’s world, history almost always repeats itself. But it’s the third problem that makes Kat’s crew the most nervous and that is simply… the emerald is cursed. Kat might be in way over her head, but she’s not going down without a fight. After all she has her best friend—the gorgeous Hale—and the rest of her crew with her as they chase the Cleopatra around the globe, dodging curses, realizing that the same tricks and cons her family has used for centuries are useless this time. Which means, this time, Katarina Bishop is making up her own rules.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/uncommon-criminals-heist-society-2.jpg","author":"Ally Carter","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/uncommon-criminals-heist-society-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:41 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:31:04 AM"}}
