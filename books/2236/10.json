{"id":108189,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"\"Cordelia Botkin, 1898,\" Jane hissed triumphantly. She\u0027d come up behind me as I was reshelving books that had been checked in. I was at the end of a stack close to the wall, about to wheel my cart around the end and onto the next row. I drew in a breath down low in my chest, shut my eyes, and prayed to forgive her. Tuesday morning had been going so well. \"Roe, I\u0027m so sorry! I thought you must have heard me coming.\"\\n\\n I shook my head. I tried not to lean on the cart so obviously.\\n\\n \"Cordelia who?\" I finally managed to say.\\n\\n \"Botkin. It\u0027s close enough. It doesn\u0027t actually fit, but it\u0027s close enough. This was so sloppy that I think it was an afterthought, or maybe this was even supposed to come off before Mamie Wright was killed.\" \"You\u0027re probably right, Jane. The box of candy took six days to get here, and it was mailed from the city, so whoever sent it probably thought I\u0027d get it in two or three days.\"\\n\\n I glanced around to see if anyone was in earshot. Lillian Schmidt, another librarian, was shelving books a few stacks away, but she wasn\u0027t actually within hearing distance.\\n\\n \"How does it fit, Jane?\"\\n\\n Jane flipped open the notebook she always seemed to have with her. \"Cordelia Botkin lived in San Francisco. She became the mistress of the Associated Press bureau chief, John Dunning. He\u0027d left a wife back in...\" Jane scanned her notes, \"... Dover, Delaware. Botkin mailed the wife several anonymous letters first, did your mother get any?\"\\n\\n I nodded. With a very stiff upper lip, Mother had told Lynn Liggett something she\u0027d never thought significant enough to tell me: she\u0027d gotten an incomprehensible and largely nasty anonymous letter in the mail a few days before the candy came. She\u0027d thought the incident so ugly and meaningless that she hadn\u0027t wanted to \"upset\" me with it. She had thrown it away, of course, but it had been typed.\\n\\n I was willing to bet it had been typed on the same machine that had typed the mailing label on the package.\\n\\n \"Anyway,\" Jane continued after checking her notes, \"Cordelia finally decided Dunning was going back to his wife, so she poisoned some bonbons and mailed them to Dunning\u0027s wife. The wife and a friend of hers died.\" \"Died,\" I said slowly.\\n\\n Jane nodded, tactfully keeping her eyes on her notes. \"Your father is still in newspapers, isn\u0027t he, Roe?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, he\u0027s not a reporter, but he\u0027s head of the advertising department.\" \"And he\u0027s living with his new wife, which could be said to represent \u0027another woman\u0027.\"\\n\\n \"Well, yes.\"\\n\\n \"So obviously the murderer saw the outline was roughly the same and seized the opportunity.\"\\n\\n \"Did you tell Arthur Smith about this?\"\\n\\n \"I thought I had better,\" Jane said, with a wise nod of her head.\\n\\n \"What did he say?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"He wanted to know which book I\u0027d gotten my information from, wrote that down, thanked me, looked harassed, and told me goodbye. I got the impression he\u0027s having trouble convincing his superiors about the significance of these murders. What was in the candy, do you know yet?\"\\n\\n \"No, they took the box to the state lab for analysis. Arthur warned us that some of the tests take quite a while.\"\\n\\n Lillian was moving closer and looking curious, a chronic state with Lillian. But all my co-workers were regarding me with more than normal interest. A quiet librarian finds a body at the meeting of a pretty odd club on Friday night, gets a box of doctored chocolates in the mail on Saturday, turns up dressed in all-new and uncharacteristic clothes on Monday, has a whispered conference with an excited woman on Tuesday.\\n\\n \"I\u0027d better go. I\u0027m disturbing you at work,\" Jane whispered. She knew Lillian quite well. \"But I was so excited when I tracked down the pattern, I just had to run down here and tell you. Of course, the Communist man\u0027s murder was patterned after the Marat assassination. Poor Benjamin Greer! He found the body, the newscast said.\"\\n\\n \"Jane, I appreciate your researching this for me,\" I hissed back. \"I\u0027ll take you out to lunch next week to thank you.\" The last thing I wanted to talk about was Morrison Pettigrue\u0027s murder.\\n\\n \"Oh, my goodness, that\u0027s not necessary. You gave me something to do for a while. Substituting at the school and filling in here are interesting, but nothing has been as much fun in a long time as tracking down the right murder. However, I suspect I will have to get a new hobby. All these deaths, all this fear. This is getting too close to the bone for me.\" And Jane sighed, though whether over the deaths of Mamie Wright and Morrison Pettigrue, or because she had to find a new hobby, I could not tell.\\n\\n I was on the second floor of the library, which is a large gallery running around three walls and overlooking the ground floor, where the children\u0027s books, periodicals, and circulation desk are located. I was watching Jane stride out the front door and thinking about Cordelia Botkin when I recognized someone else who was exiting. It was Detective Lynn Liggett. The library director, Sam derrick, seemed to be walking her to the door. This struck me unpleasantly. I could only suppose that Lynn Liggett had been at the library asking questions about me. Maybe she had wanted to know my work hours? More about my character? How long I had been at work that day?\\n\\n Filled with uneasy speculation, I rounded the corner of the next stack. I began shelving books automatically, still brooding over Detective Liggett\u0027s visit to the library. There was nothing bad Sam Clerrick could tell her about me, I reasoned. I was a conscientious employee. I was always on time, and I almost never got sick. I had never yelled at a member of the public, no matter how I\u0027d been tempted - especially by parents who dumped their children at the library in the summer with instructions to amuse themselves for a couple of hours while mommy and daddy went shopping.\\n\\n So why was I worried? I lectured myself. I was just seeing the down side of being involved in a criminal investigation. It was practically my civic duty not to mind being the object of police scrutiny.\\n\\n I wondered if I could reasonably be considered a suspect in Mamie\u0027s murder. I could have done it, of course. I\u0027d been home unobserved for at least an hour or more before I left for the meeting. Maybe one of the other tenants could vouch for my car being in its accustomed place, though that wouldn\u0027t be conclusive proof. And I supposed if I could have found a place that sold Mrs. See\u0027s, I could have mailed myself the candy. I could have typed the label on one of the library typewriters. Maybe Detective Liggett had been getting typing samples from all the machines! Though if the samples did match the label, it wouldn\u0027t be proof that I typed it myself. And if the sample didn\u0027t match, I could have used another machine - maybe one in my mother\u0027s office? Now the murder of Morrison Pettigrue was another kettle of fish entirely. I had never met Mr. Pettigrue, and now never would. I hadn\u0027t known where he lived until one of the other librarians had told me, but I couldn\u0027t prove either of those things, now that I came to think about it. Ignorance is hard to prove. Besides, if he\u0027d been killed late Sunday night after the abortive last meeting of Real Murders, I had no alibi at all. I\u0027d been home alone feeling sorry for myself.\\n\\n However, if by some miracle the killing could be proved to have occurred during the hour we were all together, we\u0027d all be cleared! That would be too good to be true.\\n\\n I was so busy trying to imagine all the pros and cons of arresting me that I bumped into Sally Allison, literally. She was looking at the books on needlework, of which the library had scores, Lawrenceton being a hell of a town for needlework.\\n\\n I murmured an apology. Sally murmured back, \"Don\u0027t think about it,\" but then she stayed glued to her spot, her eyes all too pointedly on the titles in front of her. The past couple of months, Sally had been a frequent patron of the library, even during what I supposed were her working hours. I didn\u0027t think she came to check out books, though she did leave with some every time. I was convinced she was checking on Perry. I wasn\u0027t surprised after what Amina had told me. Sometimes Sally didn\u0027t even speak to her son, I\u0027d noticed, but eyed him from a distance, as if watching for some sign of trouble. \"How\u0027s your mother, Roe?\" Sally asked.\\n\\n \"Just fine, thank you.\"\\n\\n \"Gotten over your scare about the candy? I didn\u0027t get to ask you last night.\" Sally had called both Mother and me for an interview when she\u0027d read the police blotter after the candy incident. Mother and I separately had been as brief as was congruent with courtesy, we discovered later when we compared notes. I thought my name had been in the paper enough recently, and Mother thought the whole incident too sordid to discuss. (Mother also, in her career-woman mode, thought an attempted poisoning would be bad for business.) \"Sally, I wasn\u0027t scared, because I didn\u0027t know then and I don\u0027t know now that someone was actually trying to hurt me or my mother. I\u0027m going to say frankly, Sally, that you\u0027re my friend and you\u0027re a reporter, and I\u0027m not sure recently just who I\u0027m talking to.\"\\n\\n Sally turned to face me. She was not angry, but she was determined. \"Being a reporter on a small newspaper doesn\u0027t mean I\u0027m not a real reporter, Roe. You\u0027re a Teagarden, so what happens to you is doubly news. Your mother is a very prominent woman in this town, and your father is a well-known man. The owner of our newspaper will not keep this police gag order agreement much longer. Does that answer your question? Lillian\u0027s coming. Have you read this book on bargello?\"\\n\\n I blinked and recovered. \"Now, Sally, I can\u0027t sew on a button. You\u0027d have to ask Mother if you want to know about needlework. Or Lillian,\" I added brilliantly, as my co-worker wheeled her own cart past the other end of the stack. Lillian, whose ears are as fine-tuned as a bat\u0027s, heard her own name and turned in, and right away she and Sally were embroiled in an incomprehensible conversation about French knots and candlewicking. A little sadly, I returned to my shelving. When I was no longer news, I wondered whether Sally would decide she was just a friend again.\\n\\n When I looked at my watch and discovered it was four o\u0027clock and I was due to get off at six, I realized I\u0027d better think about what I was going to wear to the Carriage House with Robin. He had mentioned picking me up at seven, which gave me a scant hour to get home, shower, redo my makeup, and dress. Reservations had been no problem; Tuesday was not a heavy night at the Carriage House, and I\u0027d told them 7:15. Now I had to decide what to wear. My dark blue silk was back from the cleaner\u0027s. Had I ever taken the matching sandals to be repaired after I\u0027d noticed the strap coming loose? Desperately I wished I had bought the black heels I\u0027d seen at Amina\u0027s mom\u0027s shop that morning. They\u0027d had bows on the back of the heel, and I\u0027d thought they were ravishing. Would I have time to run by and get them?\\n\\n Gradually I became aware that someone was humming on the other side of my stack with a droning, bee-like monotony.\\n\\n It could only be Lillian. Sure enough, when I pulled out a veterinarian\u0027s \"humorous look at life with animals in and out of the house\" which had been thrown in with the 364\u0027s, Lillian\u0027s round face was visible through the gap. \"I think we should be earning more money,\" Lillian said sulkily, \"and I think we should be asked before being scheduled to work nights, and I think they should never have hired that new head librarian.\"\\n\\n \"Sam Clerrick? Nights?\" I said foolishly, not knowing where to begin with my questions. Lillian had been a big Sam Clerrick fan before this moment, to the best of my knowledge. Mr. Clerrick seemed intelligent and tough to me, but I was reserving judgment on his ability to manage people. \"Oh, you haven\u0027t heard,\" Lillian said with pleasure. \"What with all the excitement in your life lately, I guess you haven\u0027t had too much time to pay attention to ordinary everyday stuff.\"\\n\\n I rolled my eyes to the ceiling. \"Lillian, what?\" Lillian wriggled her heavy shoulders in anticipation. \"You know, the Board of Trustees met two nights ago? Of course, Sam Clerrick was there, and he told them that in his view staying open at night hadn\u0027t been tried sufficiently four years ago, when it was such a flop - you remember? He wants to reinstate it for a time, with the present staff. So instead of being open one night a week we\u0027ll be open three, for a four-month trial.\"\\n\\n Four years ago Lawrenceton had been a smaller town, and remaining open more than one night a week past six o\u0027clock had only resulted in a higher electric bill and some bored librarians. Our one late night was a token bow to people who worked odd hours and couldn\u0027t get to the library any other time. Business had been picking up on that night, I thought fairly, and in view of Lawrenceton\u0027s recent population boom, another try at night opening was reasonable. Still, I felt mildly perturbed at the change in my schedule. On the other hand, it was hard to regard my job as the most important thing in my life lately.\\n\\n \"How\u0027s he going to do it without increasing staff?\" I asked without much interest.\\n\\n \"Instead of being on two librarians at a time, we\u0027ll be on in teams of librarian and volunteer on an open night.\"\\n\\n The volunteers were a mixed bunch. Mostly they tended to be older men and middle-aged to elderly women who really enjoyed books and felt at home in a library. Once they\u0027d been trained, they were a godsend, excepting the very small percentage who\u0027d taken the job to see their friends and gossip. That small percentage soon got bored and quit the program, anyway. \"I\u0027m game,\" I told Lillian.\\n\\n \"We\u0027re going to find out more about it officially today,\" Lillian went on, looking disappointed at my mild reaction. \"There\u0027s a staff meeting at 5:30, so Perry Allison\u0027s going to relieve you at the circulation desk. Hey,\" and Lillian looked at her watch obviously, \"isn\u0027t it time for you to get down there now?\" \"Yes, Lillian, I see that it is,\" I said with elaborate patience, \"and I am going.\" We took turns on circulation as we did on almost every job, since the staff was too small for much specialization but definitely full of individuals who didn\u0027t hesitate to make their preferences known. I was darned if I was going to scurry downstairs because Lillian had looked at her watch, so I continued, \"I\u0027m willing to give night hours another shot. More time off during the day might be nice, too.\" Since my night social calendar is not exactly crowded, but I didn\u0027t feel it necessary to share that thought with Lillian. I was relieved that the meeting wasn\u0027t going to be after the official library closing at 6:00.I suddenly recalled for sure that the sandals that went with the blue silk dress had a broken strap. \"Crumbs,\" I muttered, shelving the last book on my cart with such force that one on the opposite side shot out and landed on the floor.\\n\\n \"My goodness,\" said Lillian triumphantly as she bent to retrieve it. \"What\u0027s put us in such a snit, huh?\"\\n\\n I said something besides \"crumbs,\" but I only moved my lips.\\n\\n I usually enjoyed my tour in Circulation. I got to stand at the big desk to one side of the main entrance. I answered questions and accepted the books, taking the fines if the books were overdue, sliding their cards back in and putting them on book carts for transportation back to their shelves. Or I checked the books out. If there was a lot of traffic, I got a helper. Today was a slow day, which was good since my mind wouldn\u0027t stay on my work but meandered down its own path. How close my mother had come to eating a piece of that candy. How Mamie\u0027s head had looked from the back. How glad I was I hadn\u0027t seen the front. Whether the importance of being the finder of the body had given Benjamin a new lease on life after the death of his political ambitions. How pleased I was about going out with Robin that night. How exciting I found Arthur Smith\u0027s blue eyes.\\n\\n I yanked my thoughts away from this half-pleasant half-frightening stream of thought to exchange desultory conversation with the volunteer sitting with me at the checkout desk: Lizanne Buckley\u0027s father Arnie, a 66-year-old white-haired retiree with a mind like a steel trap. Once Mr. Buckley grew interested in a subject, he read everything he could find about it, and he forgot precious little of what he read. When he was through with that subject, he was through for good, but he remained a semi-authority on it. Mr. Buckley confessed on this warmish sleepy afternoon that he was beginning to find it difficult to find a new subject to research. I asked him how he\u0027d found them before, and he said it had always happened naturally.\\n\\n \"For example, I see a bee on my roses. I say to myself, Gee! Isn\u0027t that bee smaller than the one over on that rose? Are they the same kind of bee? Does this kind only get pollen from roses? Why aren\u0027t there more roses growing wild if bees carry rose pollen all over? So I read up on bees, and maybe roses. But lately, I don\u0027t know, nothing seems to jump out and grab me.\" I sympathized and suggested now that warmer weather would permit him to take more walks, a new subject would present itself. \"In view of what\u0027s been happening in this town recently,\" Mr. Buckley commented, \"I thought it might be interesting to research murderers.\" I looked at him sharply, but he wasn\u0027t trying to hint about the involvement of Real Murders members in the series of crimes.\\n\\n \"Why don\u0027t you do that?\" I asked after a minute.\\n\\n \"The books are all checked out,\" he said.\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n \"Almost all the nonfiction books about murder and murderers are out,\" he elaborated patiently.\\n\\n That wasn\u0027t so startling, once I had time to mull it over. All the members of Real Murders - all the former members of Real Murders - were undoubtedly boning up and preparing themselves however they could for what might happen. But someone might be boning up to make the happening occur.\\n\\n That was sickening. I looked it in the face for a second, then had to turn away. I could not visualize, did not dare to visualize, someone I knew poring over books, trying to select what old murder to imitate next, what terrible act to re-create on the body of someone he knew.\\n\\n Perry came to the desk to relieve me so I could attend the meeting, which seemed so irrelevant I almost picked up my sweater and walked out the front door instead. I had a date tonight, too. Suddenly my pleasure in that date was ashes in my mouth. At least part of my bleak mood could be written up to Perry; he was definitely in the throes of one of his downswings. His lips were set in a sullen line, the parentheses from nose to mouth deeper. I felt sorry for Perry suddenly, and said, \"Hi, see you later,\" as warmly as I could as I passed him on my way to the conference room. I regretted the warmth as he smiled in return. I wished he had stayed sullen. His smile was as vicious and meaningless as a shark\u0027s. I could imagine Perry as the Victorian poseur Neal Cream, giving prostitutes poison pills and then hanging around, hoping to watch them swallow.\\n\\n \"Go along to the meeting now,\" he said nastily. I gladly left as Arnie Buckley began the uphill battle of making conversation with Perry.\\n\\n With no enthusiasm at all, I slumped in a dreadful metal chair in the library conference room and heard the news that was already stale. Mr. derrick, with his usual efficiency and lack of knowledge of the human race, had already prepared the new duty charts and he distributed them on the spot, instead of giving everyone the chance to digest and discuss the new schedule. I was down for Thursday night from six to nine, with Mr. Buckley penciled in tentatively as my volunteer; the volunteers hadn\u0027t yet been asked individually if they were willing to work nights, though the volunteer president had agreed in principle. Mr. derrick was going to put an advertisement in the newspaper telling our patrons the exciting news. (He actually said that.) \"Going out with our new resident writer tonight?\" Perry inquired smoothly when I returned to the check-in desk.\\n\\n He took me by surprise; my mind had been firmly on work, for once.\\n\\n \"Yes,\" I said bluntly, without thought. \"Why?\"\\n\\n I\u0027d let my distaste show; a mistake. I should have kept the surface of things amiable.\\n\\n \"Oh, no reason,\" Perry said airily, but he began to smile, a smile so false and disagreeable that for the first time I felt a little afraid. \"I\u0027ll take the desk now,\" I said. \"You can go back to your work.\" I didn\u0027t smile and my voice was flat; it was too late now to patch it up. For an awful minute I didn\u0027t think he\u0027d go, that the terrible gloom in Perry\u0027s head made him utterly reckless of keeping the surface of his life sewn together. \"See you later,\" Perry said, with no smile at all.\\n\\n I watched him go with goosebumps on my arms.\\n\\n \"Did he say something nasty to you, Roe?\" asked Mr. Buckley. He looked as pugnacious as a tiny old man with white hair can look. \"Not really. It\u0027s the way he said it,\" I answered, wanting to be truthful but not wanting to upset Lizanne\u0027s father.\\n\\n \"That boy\u0027s got snakes in his head, \"Mr. Buckley pronounced.\\n\\n \"I think you must be right. Now about this new schedule...\" We were soon busy again, and the surface of things was restored; but I thought Perry Allison did indeed have snakes in his head, and that his mother\u0027s frequent calls at the library were monitoring visits. Sally Allison was aware of the snakes, frightened they might slither through the widening holes in Perry\u0027s mental state.\\n\\n Mr. Buckley and I were kept busy until closing time, with a spate of \"patrons\" of all ages, coming in to do schoolwork, returning books after they\u0027d left work. Being busy made me feel more like myself again, more like there was a point to what I was doing.\\n\\n Arthur Smith was waiting by my car. I was so intent on getting home to get ready, and was so short on time, that I was more miffed than glad to see him at first.\\n\\n \"I hated to interrupt you at work unless I had to,\" he said in his serious way. \"It\u0027s all right, Arthur. Do you have any news for me?\" I thought perhaps the lab had analyzed whatever was in the chocolates.\\n\\n \"No, the lab work hasn\u0027t come back yet. Do you have any time?\"\\n\\n \"Um ... well, a few minutes.\"\\n\\n To my pleasure, he didn\u0027t look surprised at my lack of time.\\n\\n \"Well, come sit in my car, or walk with me down the block.\" I elected to walk, not wanting Lillian Schmidt to see me in a car with a man in the parking lot, for some reason. So we strolled down the sidewalk in the cooling of the evening. I can\u0027t keep up with some men since my legs are so short that they have to slow considerably but Arthur seemed to adapt well. \"What did you expect of that meeting Sunday night?\" he asked abruptly. \"I don\u0027t know what I expected. A miracle. I wanted someone to have an idea that would make the whole nightmare go away. Instead, someone went out and killed Morrison Pettigrue. My meeting really worked, huh?\" \"That death was planned before the meeting. What bites me is that I sat there in the same room with whoever killed that man, hours before he did it, and I didn\u0027t feel a thing. Even knowing a murderer was in that room .. .\"He stopped, shook his head violently, and kept walking.\\n\\n \"Do the other police believe what you do, that one person is doing all this?\" \"I\u0027m having a hard time convincing some of the other detectives about the similarities of these two cases to old murders. And since the Pettigrue murder, they\u0027re even less inclined to listen, even though when I saw the scene I told them myself it was like the assassination of Jean-Paul Marat. They almost laughed. There are so many right-wing loonies who might want kill an avowed Communist, only one or two of the other detectives are willing to accept that all these incidents are related.\"\\n\\n \"I saw Lynn Liggett at the library today. I guess she was checking up on me.\" \"We\u0027re checking up on anyone remotely involved,\" Arthur said flatly. \"Liggett\u0027s just doing her job. I\u0027m supposed to find out where you were Sunday night.\" \"After the meeting?\"\\n\\n He nodded.\\n\\n \"At home. In bed. Alone. You know I didn\u0027t have anything to do with Mamie\u0027s death, or the chocolates, or Morrison Pettigrue\u0027s murder.\" \"I know. I saw you when you found Mrs. Wright\u0027s body.\"\\n\\n I felt a ridiculous flood of warmth and gratitude at being believed. It was already late, and I did have to get ready, so I ventured, \"Is there anything else you wanted to see me about?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m a divorced man without any children,\" Arthur said abruptly.\\n\\n Taken aback, I nodded. I tried to look intelligently inquiring. \"One of the reasons I got divorced ... my wife couldn\u0027t stand the fact that in police work, sometimes things came up and I couldn\u0027t make it on time for something we\u0027d planned. Even in Lawrenceton, which is not New York or even Atlanta, right?\"\\n\\n He paused for a response, so I said, \"Right,\" uncertainly. \"So, I want to go out with you.\" Those hard blue eyes turned on me with devastating effect. \"But things will come up, and sometimes you\u0027ll be disappointed. You\u0027d have to understand beforehand, if you want to go out with me too. I don\u0027t know if you do, but I wanted to get this all out front.\" I thought: (a) this was admirably frank, (b) did this guy have an ego, or what?, \u0026copy; since he had said, \"I don\u0027t know if you do,\" there was hope for him, though it had probably been just a sop thrown in my direction, and (d) I did want to go out with him, but not from a position of weakness. Arthur was a strength-respecter.\\n\\n If took me a few moments to work this through. A few days before, I would have said, \"Okay,\" meekly, but since then I had weathered a few storms and it seemed to me I could manage better for myself.\\n\\n I watched my feet pacing along the sidewalk as I said, \"If you\u0027re saying you want to go out with me, but that anything you\u0027re doing is more important than plans we might make, I can\u0027t agree to abide by such a lopsided - understanding.\" I watched my feet move steadily. Arthur\u0027s shoes were shiny and black and would last maybe twenty years. \"Now, if you\u0027re saying the police department has priority in a crisis, I can see that. If you\u0027re not just providing a blanket excuse in advance to cover any time you just might feel like not showing up.\" I took a deep breath. So far those shoes had not marched off in another direction. \"Okay. Also, this is sounding very - exclusive, since we haven\u0027t even been out yet. I would like to handle this one date at a time.\" I\u0027d underestimated Arthur.\\n\\n \"I must have sounded too egotistical to swallow,\" he said. \"I\u0027m sorry. Will you go out with me one time?\"\\n\\n \"Okay,\" I said. Then I didn\u0027t know what to do. I looked sideways at him and he was smiling. \"What did I say \u0027okay\u0027 to?\" I asked. \"Unless I get assigned something I have to do, you have to remember this department is in the middle of a murder investigation...\" As if I was going to forget! \"... Saturday night? I\u0027ve got a popcorn popper and a VCR.\" No first dates at a man\u0027s apartment. By God, he could take me out someplace the first time. I didn\u0027t feel like wrestling right away. My experience was limited, but I knew that much. Besides, with Arthur I might not wrestle, and I didn\u0027t want to start a relationship that way.\\n\\n \"I want to go roller skating,\" I said out of the blue. Arthur couldn\u0027t have looked more stunned if I\u0027d told him I wanted to jump off the library roof. Why had I said that? I hadn\u0027t gone skating in years. I\u0027d be black and blue and make a klutz of myself in the bargain. But maybe he would too.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s original,\" Arthur said slowly. \"You really want to do that?\"\\n\\n Stuck with it, I nodded grimly.\\n\\n \"Okay,\" he said firmly. \"I\u0027ll pick you up at six, Saturday night. If that\u0027s all right. Then after we harm ourselves enough, we can go out to eat. All this is assuming I can have an evening off in the middle of three investigations. But maybe we\u0027ll have it wrapped up by then.\"\\n\\n \"Fine,\" I said. I could accept that.\\n\\n We\u0027d circled the block, so we parted at our respective cars. I watched Arthur pull out of the parking lot, and saw he was shaking his head to himself. I laughed out loud.\\n\\n I hated being late and I was late for my date with Robin. I had to ask him to wait downstairs while I put on the finishing touches. I\u0027d bought the shoes and I was enchanted with myself. Robin didn\u0027t seem surprised or put out at having to wait; but I felt rude and at a disadvantage, as if I should have something better to show as the end result of all this preparation. However, as I looked in my full-length mirror before going down, I saw I hadn\u0027t turned out badly. There hadn\u0027t been time to put up my hair, so I wore it loose with the front held back with a cloisonne butterfly comb. The blue silk dress was sober but at least did emphasize my visible assets. I felt very unsure before I went down the stairs, very self-conscious when I saw Robin look up. But he seemed pleased, and said, \"I like your dress.\" In his gray suit he didn\u0027t seem like the companionable person who\u0027d drunk my wine, or the college professor I\u0027d pelvically lusted after at the restaurant, but more like the fairly famous writer he really was.\\n\\n We discussed the Pettigrue murder at our table at the Carriage House, where the hostess seemed to recognize Robin\u0027s name vaguely. Though maybe she was thinking of the book character. She pronounced it \"Cur-so\" and gave us a good table. I asked him to tell me about his job at the university and how it would jibe with his writing time, both questions he seemed to have answered before. I realized this man was used to being interviewed, used to being recognized. I only felt better when I recalled that Lizanne had \"bequeathed\" him to me, and right on the tail of that thought, Lizanne\u0027s parents, Arnie and Elsa, were seated at the table opposite ours. The Crandalls, who had the townhouse to the right of mine, sat down with them.\\n\\n I had a social obligation here, so I identified them to Robin and we went over to their table.\\n\\n Arnie Buckley jumped right up, and pumped Robin\u0027s hand enthusiastically. \"Our Lizanne told us all about you!\" he said. \"We\u0027re proud a famous writer like you has come to live in Lawrenceton. Do you like it?\" Mr. Buckley had always been a Chamber of Commerce member and unashamed Lawrenceton booster. \"It\u0027s an exciting place,\" said Robin honestly.\\n\\n \"Well, well, you\u0027ll have to come by the library. Not as sophisticated as what you\u0027ll find in the city, but we like it! Elsa and I are both volunteers. Got to give our time to something now that we\u0027re retired!\" \"I mostly just help with the book sale,\" Elsa said modestly. Elsa was Lizanne\u0027s stepmother, but she had been as pretty as Lizanne\u0027s mother must have been. Arnie Buckley was a lucky man when it came to pretty women. Now gray-haired and wrinkled, Elsa was still pleasant to look at and be with. I hadn\u0027t known the Buckleys were friends of the Crandalls, but I could see where the attraction would lie. Jed Crandall, like Mr. Buckley, was no chair-bound retiree, but a pepper pot of a man, easily angered and easily appeased. His wife had always been called Teentsy, and was still, though now she certainly outweighed her husband by forty pounds or more. Teentsy and Jed now said the proper things to Robin about their being neighbors, asking him to drop in, Teentsy saying since he was a poor bachelor (and here she shot me a sly look) he might run short of food sometime, and if he did, just to knock on their door, they had a-plenty, as he could look at her and tell! \"Are you at all interested in guns?\" Jed asked eagerly. \"Mr. Jed has quite a collection,\" I told Robin hastily, thinking he might need to be forewarned.\\n\\n \"Well, sometimes, from a professional standpoint. I\u0027m a mystery writer,\" he explained when the Crandalls looked blank, though the Buckleys were nodding with vigor, bless their hearts.\\n\\n \"Come by then, don\u0027t be a stranger!\" Jed Crandall urged. \"Thank you, nice meeting you,\" Robin said to the table in general, and in a chorus of \"see you soon\u0027s\" and \"nice to\u0027ve met you\u0027s\" we retired to our table. The meeting nudged Robin\u0027s voracious curiosity, and in telling him about the Crandalls and the Buckleys I began to feel more comfortable. We talked about Robin\u0027s new job, and then our food came, and by the time we began eating, I was ready to talk about the murders.\\n\\n \"Jane Engle came by the library today with a pretty solid theory,\" I began, and told Robin about the likeness of \"our\" case to that of Cordelia Botkin. He was intrigued.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve never heard of anything quite like this,\" he said after our salad had been served. \"What a book this would make! Maybe I\u0027ll write about it myself, my first nonfiction book.\" He had more distance from the case; new in town, he didn\u0027t know the victims personally (unless you could term Mother a victim) and probably he didn\u0027t know the perpetrator either. I was surprised that the crimes were so exciting to him, until he said after he\u0027d swallowed a mouthful of tomato, \"You know, Roe, writing about crime doesn\u0027t mean you have direct experience. This is the closest I\u0027ve ever come to a real murder.\"\\n\\n I could have said the same thing as a reader. I\u0027d been an avid fan of both real and fictional crime for years, but this was my closest brush with violent death. \"I hope I never come any closer,\" I said abruptly. He reached across the table and took my hand. \"It doesn\u0027t seem too likely,\" he said cautiously. \"I know the poisoned candy - well, we don\u0027t know yet if it was really poisoned or not, do we? That was scarey. But it was impersonal, too, wasn\u0027t it? Your mother\u0027s situation vaguely fit the Botkin case, even if not as well as Mamie Wright fit Julia Wallace\u0027s profile. That was why she was picked.\" \"But it was sent to my address,\" I said, suddenly letting a fear overwhelm me that I thought I\u0027d suppressed. \"That was to involve me. My mother fit the pattern; though that wouldn\u0027t have been any consolation to me if she\u0027d died,\" I added sharply. \"But sending it to my place. That was a deliberate attempt to make me - die. Or at least a witness to my mother\u0027s dying, or getting sick, depending on what was in the chocolates. That doesn\u0027t fit any pattern. That\u0027s about as personal as you can get.\"\\n\\n \"What kind of person could do that?\" Robin asked. I met his eyes. \"That\u0027s the core, isn\u0027t it,\" I said. \"That\u0027s one reason we like old murders so much. At a safe remove, we can think about the kind of person who can \u0027do that\u0027 without remorse. Almost anyone could kill another person. I guess I could, if it came to being cornered. But I\u0027m sure, I have to be sure, that not many people could sit back and plan other people dying as part of a game the killer decided to play. I have to believe that.\" \"I do too,\" he said.\\n\\n \"This really is someone who isn\u0027t acting for any of the famous motives Tennyson Jessie wrote about,\" I continued. \"It must be someone acting out something he\u0027s always wanted to do. For some reason, now he\u0027s able to actually do it.\" \"A member of your club.\"\\n\\n \"A former member,\" I said sadly, and told Robin about the Sunday night meeting. We had to talk about something else; didn\u0027t we have anything to discuss besides murders? Robin, bless him, seemed to see I couldn\u0027t take any more, and began telling me about his agent, and about the process of getting a book published. He kept me laughing with anecdotes about book-signings he\u0027d endured and I responded with stories about people that came to the library and some of the wilder questions they\u0027d asked. We actually had a cheerful evening, and we were still at our table when the Crandalls and the Buckleys paid their bill and left. Since the Carriage House was at the south end of town, we had to pass in front of our townhouses to turn into the driveway on the side. There was a man standing in front of the row of townhouses, on the sidewalk. As we went by, he turned his white face to us and by the light of the streetlamp, I thought I recognized Perry.\\n\\n I was distracted though by the kiss Robin gave me at my back door. It was unexpected and delicious, and the disparity in our heights was overcome quite satisfactorily. Maybe his asking me out hadn\u0027t been quite so impersonal as I\u0027d supposed; his side of the kiss was delivered with great enthusiasm. I went upstairs humming to myself and feeling very attractive; and when I slipped into my dark bedroom and peered out the window, the street was empty.\\n\\n That night it rained. I was wakened by the drops pelting against my window. I could see the lightning flicker through my curtains. I crept downstairs and rechecked my locks. I listened, and heard only the rain. I looked out all the windows and saw only the rain. By the streetlamp out front, I saw the water racing down the slight slope to the storm drain at the end of the block. Nothing else stirred. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/real-murders-aurora-teagarden-1/page-10.html","bookId":2236,"book":{"id":2236,"title":"Real Murders (Aurora Teagarden #1)","description":"Storyline: Real Murders (Aurora Teagarden Mysteries #1) \\n Though a small town at heart, Lawrenceton, Georgia, has its dark side-and crime buffs.
