But he looked such a fright That his aunt took flight, And he cried till night, they say. A pale pink pig, In a large blond wig, Danced a wild, wild jig On the lea; But a rude old goat, In a sky-blue coat, Said, “You’re nought but a shoat, tee hee!” A poor old King Sold his gay gold ring For to buy his old wife some cream; But the cat lapped it up With a sip and a sup, [8]And his tears ran down in a stream.

A boy named Sam Had a fat pet ram, And gave him some jam For his tea; But the fat pet ram Tried to butt poor Sam, Till he had to turn And flee. A girl named Jane Had a sad, bad pain In the place where she wore [9]Her belt; She mopped and she mowed, And she screamed aloud, Just to show the crowd How she felt.
