My favorite color. It’s perfect.”\n “I had to guess at the size.”\n Allison threw her arms around him. “I love you.” They clung to each other for a long moment. When he kissed her, she felt as if she’d spun off into some new galaxy, unknown to anyone but them. It was hard to break away from him, hard to remember that they were in full view of the road and anyone who happened to drive by.\n “Thank you, Anson,” she said softly, gazing down at her ring again. “This is so thoughtful. It’s so you.”\n “I wish it was the Hope Diamond.”\n “In my heart it is.” Allison would treasure this ring all her life. She didn’t want him to go, especially so far from Cedar Cove, but at the same time, she knew this was an unmatched opportunity for him. She wouldn’t take it away from Anson for anything.\n Anson locked his arms at the small of her back and leaned his forehead against hers. “Wait for me.”\n Allison nodded. “I’m not going anywhere. I’ll always be here for you, Anson. Always.”\n He kissed her again. They separated reluctantly and, holding hands, walked back to the parked car.\n In the morning Anson would be gone.\n Ten\n When Teri left the mall Tuesday evening after work, she found James waiting for her. Her husband’s driver, following Bobby’s instructions, drove her to and from the salon; Bobby seemed to think she was safer that way. James stood outside the car near the passenger door, waiting for her. “Good evening, Miss Teri.”\n “Good evening, James.” The minute she’d slipped inside the vehicle, she took off her shoes and rubbed her aching feet. She’d had a lot of clients and hardly any breaks.\n “Did you have a good day?” he asked in a solicitous voice.\n “Yes, thanks.” Generally James wasn’t very talkative. For some reason he’d been more sociable the last few days.\n “I thought it was commendable of you to invite your family for dinner last weekend.”\n Well, it’d been an experience, that was for sure. “It’s nice of you to say so.”\n He dutifully closed the car door before walking around to the driver’s side. About halfway home, Teri noticed that James kept glancing at her in the rearview mirror.\n “Is something the matter, James?” she asked, finding his behavior curious.\n “Wrong, miss?”\n “You keep looking at me.”\n “Sorry, miss, it’s just that you and your sister don’t resemble each other at all.”\n Teri snickered. “She’s my half sister and she got the beauty while I got the brains.” Teri wasn’t convinced that was an accurate assessment, but it sounded good.\n “She is beautiful,” he murmured.\n Surprised at the comment, Teri studied him for a moment. It had never occurred to her that James might be romantically interested in her sister. But why not? And why wouldn’t Christie be interested in him? He was single, employed and attractive in his own way. A considerable improvement over the men she usually chose.\n “James,” she said. “Don’t take me directly home this evening.”\n “I beg your pardon, Miss Teri?”\n “Take me to my sister’s house.”\n “She lives in an apartment.”\n “Okay, her apartment then.” Teri hadn’t been in contact with Christie in quite some time and certainly hadn’t visited her current home.\n “Should I let Bobby know?”\n “No, we’ll only be a few minutes.”\n James sat up a bit straighter. “Whatever you say, miss.”\n “James, call me Teri.”\n “Yes, miss.”\n The drive took a few minutes, so Teri asked James about her husband. Ever since the threat, he’d hardly left the house. But every day, regular as clockwork, he sat in front of the chessboard. How he could concentrate without men on the board was beyond her, but what did she know?\n “How was Bobby’s day?” she asked. Teri was more concerned about her husband than she wanted to let on. He’d become withdrawn lately. The fact that he sent his driver to escort her to and from work told her he was almost paranoid about her safety. He hated it whenever she left his sight. Clearly there was more to this threat than she’d known. Bobby knew, though, and he wasn’t taking any chances. Teri loved her husband; because of that, she wasn’t about to let some goon blackmail him, using her as bait. She needed to find out what was going on and take action.\n James didn’t respond to her question right away, which implied far more than anything he might have said.\n “He stayed in the house all day, Miss Teri.”\n “Do you know why he hasn’t played in any tournaments lately?” she asked, deciding to force the issue.\n “No—Teri.” He drove into the parking lot of the apartment building on Beach Road\n and turned off the engine. “Your sister’s in the bottom-floor unit, number 102,” he told her.\n “Thank you, James.”\n He was out of the car and opening her door before Teri had even managed to unfasten her seat belt, then waited by the vehicle while she walked toward her sister’s place. The stretch limo had caught the attention of several residents and half a dozen children came toward James, full of questions.\n Christie answered her knock with a soda in her hand. She blinked in astonishment when she saw Teri.\n “What are you doing here?” she asked.\n Teri shrugged, feeling a bit awkward. “I came by to see how you’re doing.” That was the truth—or part of it. She genuinely wanted to reestablish a relationship with her sister. She also thought that encouraging a relationship with James could benefit them all.\n “You care?”\n “I wouldn’t be here if I didn’t. I’m inviting you to dinner.”\n Christie eyed her suspiciously. “Again? Aren’t you worried that I might hit on your precious Bobby?”\n She was and yet she wasn’t. She trusted her husband. Of all the women in the world, he’d chosen to fall in love with her. Bobby Polgar might be many things but fickle he wasn’t, and any fear or jealousy she’d felt had evaporated in the warmth of his love.\n Teri grinned. “You can try, but it won’t get you anywhere.”\n Christie straightened when she saw James standing outside the car with kids swarming around him in the parking lot.\n Teri noticed her sister’s reaction right away. “I’ll send James to pick you up tomorrow. Shall we say six?”\n “I guess that’d be all right.” Christie acted as though she was doing Teri a favor.\n James held the car door for Teri when she returned. “I hope you won’t mind picking up my sister for dinner tomorrow night,” she said.\n “Not at all, Miss Teri. It would be my pleasure.”\n She had the distinct impression that he meant every word.\n The rest of the ride to Seaside Avenue\n took place in silence. When James let her out, the front door opened immediately and Bobby exploded out.\n “You’re all right?” he demanded, grabbing Teri by the upper arms. His eyes raked over her as if checking for injury.\n “Bobby, of course I’m all right. Why wouldn’t I be?”\n “You’re late.”\n Instantly Teri felt guilty. She should’ve phoned or had James call Bobby, as he’d suggested. “I asked James to drive me to Christie’s.”\n There was unmistakable relief in her husband’s eyes. He hugged her, holding her close. With her arms around Bobby’s neck, Teri looked deep into his eyes. She saw in him such love it made her want to weep—and she saw something else. She saw his fear. Bobby was afraid for her. Afraid someone would take her away from him.\n “Let’s sit down and talk,” she said, leading him into the house.\n They both sat on the elegant leather couch, and Teri slid close, leaning her head against his chest. “I need to ask you a question.”\n “What is it?”\n “I need to know why you’re keeping a constant watch over me.”\n He frowned. “So I can be sure you’re safe.” He seemed to feel that should be obvious.\n “I am safe, I promise you. But if you’ve received a threat, then we should deal with it together. We could go to the police or—”\n “No!” He shook his head and withdrew his hand from hers.\n Something had happened. His body language made that clear. “Bobby,” she whispered, turning to face him. “You’d better tell me.”\n His expression was completely deadpan. He didn’t speak, simply shook his head again.\n Teri’s chest tightened and she rose onto her knees, holding his face between her palms. “Bobby, listen to me. I’m your wife and married people communicate with each other. Whatever’s going on, I need to know about it. You should tell me. That’s what married people do.”\n He shifted uneasily.\n “Ever since that day those two men showed up at Get Nailed, you’ve been acting weird. Something happened and you’re carrying the weight of this problem all by yourself. I have to know what’s bothering you.” When he didn’t respond, she said, “They threatened me, didn’t they?”\n He didn’t answer.\n “Bobby! I realize you’re trying to protect me and I love you for it, but you’re miserable and because you’re miserable, so am I.”\n He still wouldn’t look at her.\n “You haven’t played any tournaments in weeks. You were born to play chess. It’s your life.”\n “You’re my life,” he countered. “Nothing is more important to me than you.”\n “I can’t be happy if you aren’t,” she said gently.\n Bobby closed his eyes. “Shortly after those men came to see you,” he said in a low voice, “I received a phone call from Aleksandr Vladimir.”\n “Who?”\n “Vladimir. He’s a Russian chess player. He asked me how you were feeling and then said he hoped you were…safe.”\n That was it? “Maybe that’s just a Russian way of congratulating you on our marriage,” she suggested. “Or of extending his best wishes.”\n “No.” Bobby’s eyes hardened. “He was letting me know that he was behind the incident in June—with you and James outside the beauty shop.”\n “Okay,” she returned thoughtfully. “If you feel he was making a threat, veiled or otherwise, then we need to report him to the authorities.”\n “No!” Bobby clenched and unclenched his fists. “I have no way of connecting him to the threat. No proof. Going to the police would put you in danger. Don’t ask me to do that, because I can’t.” Rarely had she seen him react more vehemently to anything. His emotion, more than his words, told her how heavily this had weighed on his mind.\n Before she could attempt to reassure him, Bobby kissed the side of her neck, sending shivers down her arms. “I like you more than chess,” he whispered. His fingers slipped inside the opening of her blouse. “Am I communicating well?” \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/74-seaside-avenue-cedar-cove-7/page-13.html","bookId":1948,"book":{"id":1948,"title":"74 Seaside Avenue (Cedar Cove #7)","description":"Storyline: \n 74 Seaside Avenue (Cedar Cove #7) \n Dear Reader, I\u0027m living a life I couldn\u0027t even have\" dreamed\" of a few years ago.
