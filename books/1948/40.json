He obviously regretted those kisses as much as she did. Every time she thought about the way she’d responded to him, she got upset. They’d both been out of line, and her biggest fear was that this momentary slip might have ruined one of the most agreeable friendships of her life. When Bruce’s car pulled up to the curb, Rachel wasn’t sure whether to be relieved or not. Reaching for her suitcase, she hurried outside, pausing only long enough to lock the door. According to the Pittsburgh forecast, which she’d looked up on the Internet, the weather there was unseasonably cold for mid-October. She’d brought along her winter coat, slung over her arm because she certainly didn’t need it in Cedar Cove right now. The Pacific Northwest enjoyed moderate temperatures, although it was uncomfortably cool at night. Without a word of greeting, Bruce was out of the car. He took the suitcase from her hand and heaved it into the trunk. She noticed that his eyes avoided hers. Rachel felt wretched. If they were going to remain friends, they needed to clear the air. She waited until she was inside the car and had fastened her seat belt. “I really appreciate your doing this,” she said, thinking that showing her gratitude was a good start. “No problem.” His response was clipped, as if he’d rather not talk to her at all. Driving into Seattle during the morning rush hour wasn’t a negligible task; Bruce was doing her a huge favor. But he’d volunteered as soon as she’d mentioned it. He had his own business, so he could take the time off. As they neared the freeway on-ramp she finally referred to that foolish kiss. “I guess maybe we should talk about what happened Friday night,” she said, fiddling nervously with the strap of her handbag. “What’s there to talk about?” Bruce returned, focusing his attention on the road ahead. “I want to be sure it hasn’t damaged our friendship.” “It hasn’t.” “I know you regret the whole thing. So do I,” she continued. He turned his head briefly, glancing in her direction. “I never said I regretted it.” “You apologized,” she reminded him. “That’s not the same as regretting it.” Rachel frowned, a little confused. “Oh. I guess not.” She didn’t really see the difference, but that didn’t matter. “Our friendship means a great deal to me.” “And me. You’ve been wonderful with Jolene.” “It’s more than Jolene, though.” “Yes,” he snapped. “It is.” A familiar ache came over Rachel. She loved Jolene, and she cared about Bruce. More than cared about him? Everything was suddenly too complicated. She grew quiet after his remark, and Bruce didn’t seem inclined to speak, either. When they arrived at Sea-TacAirport, he stopped at the curb. The sidewalk in front of the terminal was swarming with people. Bruce left the engine running as he hopped out of the car and retrieved her suitcase from the trunk. He’d set it on the curb before Rachel had a chance to gather the rest of her things and climb out. Apparently he couldn’t get rid of her fast enough. They stood there awkwardly, facing each other in the midst of people coming and going, dropping off travelers, unloading bags. He seemed every bit as nervous as she was. “Have a good flight,” Bruce finally murmured. “Thank you. I’m sure I will.” Within hours, she’d be seeing Nate again and she should be feeling elated. Excited. Only she wasn’t. She’d rather sort this out with Bruce. Or at least effect some kind of reconciliation before she left. She hated this unsettled feeling. Still, she’d tried, and he didn’t seem interested. And Rachel didn’t feel she could press any more than she already had. It wasn’t right to be flying off to visit Nate and his family while she was thinking about another man. This would be an important week. The political fundraiser the next afternoon was critical to Nate’s family, and Rachel was determined to do everything she could to become an asset to both Nate and his father. Then, surprising her again, Bruce stepped closer and hugged her. This wasn’t a token hug; he held her tight, as if he didn’t want to let her go. After a moment, he dropped his arms. Shocked, and more confused than ever, Rachel moved toward her suitcase and without looking back, picked it up and walked into the terminal. Nate had arranged his flight into Pittsburgh so that he’d arrive from San Diego thirty minutes ahead of her. When she came out of the jetway, he was at the gate waiting for her. One glance at her handsome navy man, and Rachel gave a small cry of delight. She flew into his arms. It felt like forever since they’d been together, although it had only been a month. “Dad sent a car for us,” Nate said as he slipped an arm around her waist. He gazed down at her, his eyes full of warmth. “You look wonderful.” Rachel couldn’t keep from blushing at his praise. “You, too.” “There’s a dinner this evening that Mom suggested we attend. You don’t mind, do you?” Rachel did mind, but she couldn’t protest, since Nate’s family had paid for her airline ticket. She’d hoped she and Nate would have this evening to themselves. That obviously wouldn’t be the case. The driver found them in the baggage claim area, and soon they were on their way. As Nate relayed the itinerary for the next two days, it seemed unlikely that they’d have more than a minute to themselves at any given time. The culminating event, the rally, was where Nate’s father would announce that he’d be running for the senate. “Stop,” she said at one point. “My head is spinning. Are we required to attend all these functions?” In addition to the rally, there were a number of meals and cocktail parties, sometimes as many as three in a single afternoon. There were also visits to service clubs, senior citizens’ organizations, schools and even a shopping mall, where they’d hand out flyers. Nate seemed surprised that she’d asked. “Of course we’re going to all of them. That’s what you do during a political campaign. Trust me, I should know.” “Were you always this involved?” “Except for the last few years, yes.” He took her hand. “I should tell you that Dad and I’ve been talking.” Rachel didn’t know if that was a good thing or not, although of his parents, she preferred his father. Nathaniel Olsen was a consummate politician and had a way of making everyone he met feel like his best friend. Still, as much as she hoped the congressman approved of her relationship with Nate, Rachel couldn’t be sure. Nate’s mother, on the other hand, hadn’t bothered to disguise her objections. This time Rachel was prepared for that. No matter what Patrice said or did, she refused to let the other woman upset her. “Dad wants me to work for him when I get out of the navy,” Nate said. He clearly thought she’d be pleased. She wasn’t; it was exactly what she’d always feared. When they’d first met, Nate claimed he had no political aspirations of his own. She was beginning to seriously doubt that. Nate loved campaigning, loved the challenge and the excitement. He was used to privilege and to the advantages conferred by wealth and power. Wherever they went, as long as he was with his father, he was a guest of honor. “I thought you hadn’t made a decision about reenlisting in the navy?” They’d discussed this a number of times. “I haven’t,” Nate was quick to tell her. His flippant response gave her the distinct feeling that he actually had. The driver delivered them to the Olsen residence outside the city. The huge, two-story house seemed more like a palace to Rachel; it was even grander than she’d expected. There were fifteen acres of beautifully landscaped grounds, and the house itself looked as if it belonged in a glossy architectural magazine. “Come on,” Nate said, taking her hand. Rachel managed to close her mouth and gulp in a deep breath before Patrice Olsen, Nate’s mother, came hurrying out the front door, arms wide. Nate released Rachel’s hand long enough to hug his mother, lifting Patrice off the ground in his exuberance. Inside the Olsen residence, everything seemed to be made of Italian marble or polished mahogany, and every piece of furniture looked like a priceless antique. Rachel was afraid to touch any surface for fear of smudging it, afraid to walk anywhere for fear of leaving footprints in the deep, soft carpeting. She’d been escorted to a guest room that felt more like a hotel room, but far nicer than any she’d ever stayed at. Dinner was just an hour after their arrival so Rachel didn’t have time to do more than admire her room, change her clothes and freshen her makeup before they had to leave. The next morning, there was a breakfast at which Nate and Rachel were required to mingle. With Nate at her side, she found it wasn’t as difficult as she’d assumed. Afterward he complimented her, and that went a long way toward soothing her nerves. “You’re doing really well,” he assured her as they hurried from the breakfast to a factory and then a huge assisted-living complex. Naturally, the local press showed up everywhere. Rachel prayed no one would address any questions to her or ask about her role. She marveled at both Nate and his father. At each stop, each occasion, she saw how effectively they spoke, how inspiring they were. The rally the next afternoon was the main event, followed by a formal dinner. Saturday was another long day of appearances until finally they entered the auditorium where the rally would be held. Rachel sat with rapt attention through all the speeches and applauded at all the appropriate places. At the end of Nathaniel’s speech, during which he declared his candidacy, she joined the crowd in giving him a standing ovation. When the applause died down, the congressman brought Nate onto the stage and introduced him, telling his constituents how proud he was to have a son serving in the military. With tears in her eyes, Rachel clapped wildly. To the sound of cheering, Nate stood next to his father and raised both arms. Then father and son embraced in what was truly a touching moment. Patrice Olsen moved down one seat in order to sit beside Rachel. “He looks good with his father, doesn’t he?” she said, leaning close. “Very good.” Rachel smiled over at Nate’s mother and continued applauding. “Nathaniel has political ambitions for our son.” Rachel had already assumed as much. “I can see he’d do a wonderful job.” After watching Nate with his father, it seemed inevitable that he’d follow in the older man’s footsteps. “Nate gets out of the navy in less than a year.” Rachel nodded. She and Nate had discussed that very subject shortly after she’d landed in Pittsburgh. Until that point, Rachel had been under the misconception that he hadn’t decided whether or not to re-enlist. She’d guessed then that Nate wasn’t going to. “Dirk Hagerman is a friend of Nathaniel’s. Dirk’s retiring as a state representative, and they’ve been talking about getting him to endorse Nate as a candidate for his seat. Nate’s military background and the fact that he went in as an enlisted man—it all bodes well. We have every belief that he could win his first time out.”","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/74-seaside-avenue-cedar-cove-7/page-40.html","bookId":1948,"book":{"id":1948,"title":"74 Seaside Avenue (Cedar Cove #7)","description":"Storyline: 74 Seaside Avenue (Cedar Cove #7) Dear Reader, I\u0027m living a life I couldn\u0027t even have\" dreamed\" of a few years ago.
