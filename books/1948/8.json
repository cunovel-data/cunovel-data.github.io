He nodded. “I told Mom we wouldn’t be serving any alcohol.” “Okay.” Bobby studied her. Bobby could be completely oblivious to what was going on around him—the time of day, the weather, even what month it was. However, when it came to Teri, he seemed to notice more than she sometimes realized. “Is your sister like you?” he asked. Now, that was an interesting question. Christie wasn’t like her, and yet she was. Two years younger, Christie had tagged after her for the first twelve years of Teri’s life. Anything Teri had, Christie wanted—and generally got. Teri could say without hesitation that their mother had always favored her younger daughter. And yet Christie was capable of kindness on occasion, which Teri found all too easy to forget. She knew enough about human nature to understand that she and Christie shared an insecurity that probably stemmed from their mother’s selfishness and neglect. Ruth might have preferred Christie and spoiled her but both girls had suffered. They just expressed their insecurity with contrasting kinds of behavior. “Well, in some ways Christie and I are alike,” she conceded. “Then why are you afraid?” “Concerned,” she said. She had to learn to trust her husband. The biggest test would come this very evening, and she’d know once and for all if Bobby truly loved her. “Does Donald play chess?” he asked next. “Mike,” she corrected. This time around, her mother hadn’t bothered to introduce the new man in her life. Well, for that matter, Teri hadn’t introduced Bobby, either—but for entirely different reasons. “Does Mike play chess?” He revised the question. “I don’t know.” Teri loved Bobby all the more for asking. He wasn’t comfortable in social situations and didn’t handle them well. For the most part he avoided even small gatherings; they tended to overwhelm him. The doorbell chimed, and Teri felt herself tense. “This is going to be a perfect dinner,” she said aloud. Maybe voicing the words would make it happen, although she was pretty sure she sounded more sarcastic than hopeful. The last time the entire family had been together was two Christmases ago, and it’d been an unmitigated disaster. Ruth and Donald were already drunk and in the middle of a pointless argument when Teri arrived for Christmas dinner. Johnny was late and their sister had left in a fit of anger, furious over something trivial. Teri was stuck refereeing between her mother and her worthless husband. She’d done her best to be festive and cheerful, and all she got in return was anger and resentment. No one else, apparently, was interested in celebrating anything. Because she’d wanted to see Johnny, she’d waited until he got there; she’d spent an hour talking to him, then went home, glad to make her escape. That year, she’d spent the rest of Christmas Day propped up in bed with a good book and a large chocolate bar. She’d felt guilty about abandoning Johnny to their lunatic family, but she couldn’t have been happier to get away. Yet, here she was, willing to try all over again. When she opened the door, Christie stood on the other side. Teri should’ve known her half sister would show up right on time. She looked awestruck—and envious. The house was impressive, Teri had to admit. “Some digs you’ve got here,” Christie said. “Mom and Mike are parking the car and they’re going to have a smoke before they come in.” Her gaze immediately shot past Teri and flew to Bobby. “Hello,” she cooed and practically shoved past Teri in order to greet Bobby. “I’m Christie.” She held out her hand, and when Bobby moved to shake it, she deftly slipped into his arms for a gentle hug. “We’re family, after all,” she said, smiling up at him with undisguised admiration. Bobby extricated himself and stood beside Teri, resting his hand on her shoulder. “Bobby Polgar.” “I know all about you,” Christie told him. “I read your story on the Internet. You’re, like, the most popular checkers player in the world.” “Chess,” Teri muttered. Reaching for her husband’s hand, she gave it a squeeze. “Bobby plays chess.” “Oh.” Her sister’s face fell. “Well, I remembered it was one of those board games.” Unlike Teri, her sister was tall with curves in all the right places, and she knew how to use them. Her blouse was cut low in the front, displaying an almost indecent amount of cleavage. Bobby, bless his heart, didn’t seem to notice. “Shall we sit down?” Teri suggested. Dinner was ready, so there was nothing to distract her in the kitchen. The last thing Teri intended to do was give her sister time alone with Bobby. They walked slowly into the living room, then sat and stared at each other. They were like aliens from different planets meeting to negotiate a peace settlement—like on Star Trek, Teri thought. Except there was no Captain Picard to guide them. Silently Teri pleaded with Bobby to say something. Anything. He cast her a helpless look in response. Teri clutched his hand as if it were a lifeline that connected her to the mother ship as she drifted around outer space. “I’m surprised my sister caught such a handsome man,” Christie said in a bright voice. “Surprised?” Teri repeated, gritting her teeth. “Handsome?” Bobby repeated at the same time. Teri glared at him. Not Bobby, too. Her heart sank. “Handsome and rich and famous.” “My husband the checkers player.” Teri stared up at Bobby with an exaggerated starstruck expression. For further effect, she batted her eyelashes. Bobby looked uncomfortable and confused. Christie laughed softly. “Don’t tell me you’re worried that I’d try to lure Bobby away from you. My goodness, Teri, are you really that insecure?” “I…I.” She hated to admit that she was—that they both were. Her sister’s need to compete, to win, brought out the very worst in Teri, especially when there was a man involved. Christie knew her deepest fears and manipulated them. And Teri allowed her to do it. That was a pattern she recognized but couldn’t explain. Maybe it was simply habit, all those years of playing certain roles, feeling certain emotions. Christie hadn’t been in the house two minutes and already Teri hated her—and hated herself. Clearing her throat, she decided then and there that she wouldn’t play the role Christie always assigned her. The loser. The unattractive one. The rejected woman. “You can try all you want,” she said with a look of unconcern. “My husband loves me, and I trust him. So go ahead, little sister. But it isn’t going to work.” Christie blinked, obviously taken aback by Teri’s directness. “Maybe I’ll do just that,” she murmured. “We’ll see what happens.” Rather than watch, Teri excused herself to check on their dinner. She’d made her stand and now she had to step back and trust her heart—and her husband. Finding busywork in the kitchen, she gave Christie ten full minutes. When Teri returned, Christie seemed more than a little befuddled. “I don’t suppose you have any beer?” her sister asked. “No, I didn’t think it was a good idea to have alcohol around when Mom’s going to be here.” “I could use one.” Teri caught her husband’s eye and, to her utter astonishment, Bobby winked. Teri grinned and so did he. Bobby knew—and he’d put Christie in her place. Teri had no idea what had gone on while she was in the kitchen. But in that moment all she wanted to do was throw herself at her husband and make love to him, regardless of who was in the room. Her husband recognized her look, and his eyes briefly flared. They shared a smile and an unspoken promise. He’d get his reward later. Teri’s mother and Mike showed up next. As soon as her mother walked inside, she oohed and aahed over the house. After introductions were exchanged, she turned to her older daughter. “Teri, this is just lovely. Give me a tour, would you? I want to see every room.” She brought one hand to her throat as she roamed from living room to kitchen to dining room, commenting on each feature. Like an obedient puppy, Mike silently trailed behind. “Teri’s got the bucks now and she can flaunt it,” Christie said. The words had a deflated quality that Teri chose to ignore. Johnny arrived last and a genuine smile lit up his face when he saw Teri. He immediately hugged her and whispered, “It’s not so bad, is it?” “Not bad at all.” “Great.” Her mother left to go to the car and returned with a case of beer. “This is Mike’s and my contribution to dinner,” she said, setting it down on the kitchen counter. Before Teri could protest, Christie had pulled out a bottle, twisted off the cap and taken her first swig. Ruth and Mike followed in quick succession. Johnny met her eyes and shrugged. There was nothing either of them could do now. The evening deteriorated from that point on. Ruth and Mike, along with Christie, sat in the living room and drank beer while Teri served appetizers they mostly ignored. Bobby and Johnny gamely swallowed cheese puffs and shrimp. “I baked a ham,” Teri announced. Bobby got up and stood behind her, as if protecting her from harm. “I hope everyone’s hungry,” Johnny added, joining them. “Looks like Teri’s been cooking all day.” She’d taken real pride in this dinner, but that was beside the point. She smiled gratefully at her brother. “It looks like she’s been eating all day, too,” her mother said, and seemed to find herself exceptionally funny. One hand on her hip, Teri said, “No more beer for you, understand?” Ruth’s head came back as though she’d been struck. “What did you say?” “I said this is my house and if you want to drink, you’ll do it elsewhere.” “Fine, I will.” She stood and the still-silent Mike stood with her. Although she’d threatened to leave, Ruth didn’t seem to be in any rush. “You think you’re so smart because you’re married to this hotshot checkers player,” her mother spat. “Just because you’ve got money doesn’t mean you can tell people how to run their lives.” Everyone froze, and then Bobby stepped forward. Without saying a word, he picked up Ruth’s handbag. “What’s he doing with my purse?” she demanded. Marching into the entry, Bobby set her mother’s purse down by the front door. “Are you kicking me out?” Ruth cried. “I can’t believe this! My own daughter’s asking me to leave her home.” She glanced around the room, seeking support and finding none. Then she headed toward Mike, grabbing his arm. “I thought you said you were leaving anyway,” Christie commented. “Yeah, Mom,” Johnny said cheerfully as he held open the front door. “You drink, you go. That’s Teri’s rule.”","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/74-seaside-avenue-cedar-cove-7/page-8.html","bookId":1948,"book":{"id":1948,"title":"74 Seaside Avenue (Cedar Cove #7)","description":"Storyline: 74 Seaside Avenue (Cedar Cove #7) Dear Reader, I\u0027m living a life I couldn\u0027t even have\" dreamed\" of a few years ago.
