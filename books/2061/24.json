{"id":110630,"no":24,"title":"Page 24","content":"Twenty-three\n THE WEATHER WARMED UP ON the day of my molnija ceremony. In fact, it was so warm that a lot of the snow on campus began melting, running down the sides of the Academy\u0027s stone buildings in slim, silvery streams. Winter was far from being over, so I knew everything would just freeze up again in a few days. For now, though, it felt as though the entire world was weeping.\n I had walked away from the Spokane incident with minor bruises and cuts. The burns from the melting flex-cuffs were the worst of my injuries. But I was still having a hard time dealing with the death I\u0027d caused and the death I\u0027d seen. I\u0027d wanted little more than to go curl up in a ball somewhere and not talk to anyone, except maybe Lissa. But on my fourth day back at the Academy, my mother had found me and told me it was time to receive my marks.\n It had taken me several moments to grasp what she was talking about. Then it occurred to me that in decapitating two Strigoi, I\u0027d earned two molnija tattoos. My first ones. The realization had stunned me. All my life, in considering my future career as a guardian, I\u0027d looked forward to the marks. I\u0027d seen them as badges of honor. But now? Mainly they were going to be reminders of something I wanted to forget.\n The ceremony took place in the guardians\u0027 building, in a large room they used for meetings and banquets. It was nothing at all like the great dining room at the resort. It was efficient and practical, like the guardians were. The carpet was a bluish gray shade, low and tightly woven. The bare white walls held framed black-and-white photos of St. Vladimir\u0027s through the years. There were no other decorations or fanfare, yet the solemnity and power of the moment were palpable. All the guardians on campus- but no novices- attended. They milled around in the building\u0027s main meeting room, hanging out in clusters but not talking. When the ceremony started, they fell into orderly ranks without being told and watched me.\n I sat on a stool in the corner of the room, leaning forward with my hair hanging over the front of my face. Behind me, a guardian named Lionel held a tattooist\u0027s needle to the back of my neck. I\u0027d known him the whole time I\u0027d been at the Academy, but I\u0027d never realized he was trained to draw molnija marks.\n Before he started, he had a murmured conversation with my mother and Alberta.\n \"She won\u0027t have a promise mark,\" he said. \"She hasn\u0027t graduated.\"\n \"It happens,\" said Alberta. \"She made the kills. Do the molnijas, and she\u0027ll get the promise mark later.\"\n Considering the pain I regularly put myself through, I didn\u0027t expect the tattoos to hurt as much as they did. But I bit my lip and stayed silent as Lionel made the marks. The process seemed to go on forever. When he finished, he produced a couple of mirrors, and with some maneuvering, I was able to see the back of my neck. Two tiny black marks sat there, side by side, against my reddened and sensitive skin. Molnija meant \"lightning\" in Russian, and that\u0027s what the jagged shape was meant to symbolize. Two marks. One for Isaiah, one for Elena.\n Once I\u0027d seen them, he bandaged them up and gave me some instructions about caring for them while they healed. Most of it I missed, but I figured I could ask again later. I was still kind of shocked by it all.\n After that, all the gathered guardians came up to me one by one. They each gave me some sort of sign of affection- a hug, a kiss on the cheek- and kind words.\n \"Welcome to the ranks,\" said Alberta, her weathered face gentle as she pulled me into a tight embrace.\n Dimitri didn\u0027t say anything when his turn came, but as always, his eyes spoke legions. Pride and tenderness filled his expression, and I swallowed back tears. He rested one hand gently on my cheek, nodded, and walked away.\n When Stan- the instructor I\u0027d fought with the most since my first day- hugged me and said, \"Now you\u0027re one of us. I always knew you\u0027d be one of the best,\" I thought I\u0027d pass out.\n And then when my mother came up to me, I couldn\u0027t help the tear that ran down my cheek. She wiped it away and then brushed her fingers against the back of my neck. \"Don\u0027t ever forget,\" she told me.\n Nobody said, \"Congratulations,\" and I was glad. Death wasn\u0027t anything to get excited about.\n When that was done, drinks and food were served. I walked to the buffet table and made a plate for myself of miniature feta quiches and a slice of mango cheesecake. I ate without really tasting the food and answered questions from others without even knowing what I said half the time. It was like I was a Rose robot, going through the motions of what was expected. On the back of my neck, my skin stung from the tattoos, and in my mind, I kept seeing Mason\u0027s blue eyes and Isaiah\u0027s red ones.\n I felt guilty for not enjoying my big day more, but I was relieved when the group finally started dispersing. My mother walked up to me as others murmured their goodbyes. Aside from her words here at the ceremony, we hadn\u0027t talked much since my breakdown on the plane. I still felt a little funny about that- and a little embarrassed as well. She\u0027d never mentioned it, but something very small had shifted in the nature of our relationship. We weren\u0027t anywhere near being friends...but we weren\u0027t exactly enemies anymore either.\n \"Lord Szelsky is leaving soon,\" she told me as we stood near the building\u0027s doorway, not far from where I\u0027d yelled for her on that first day we\u0027d talked. \"I\u0027ll be going with him.\"\n \"I know,\" I said. There was no question she\u0027d leave. That was how it was. Guardians followed Moroi. They came first.\n She regarded me for a few moments, her brown eyes thoughtful. For the first time in a long time, I felt like we were actually looking eye to eye, as opposed to her looking down on me. It was about time, too, seeing as I had half a foot of height on her.\n \"You did well,\" she said at last. \"Considering the circumstances.\"\n It was only half a compliment, but I deserved no more. I understood now the mistakes and lapses of judgment that had led to the events at Isaiah\u0027s house. Some had been my fault; some hadn\u0027t. I wished I could have changed some of my actions, but I knew she was right. I\u0027d done the best I could in the end with the mess before me.\n \"Killing Strigoi wasn\u0027t as glamorous as I thought it\u0027d be,\" I told her.\n She gave me a sad smile. \"No. It never is.\"\n I thought then about all the marks on her neck, all the kills. I shuddered.\n \"Oh, hey.\" Eager to change the subject, I reached into my pocket and pulled out the little blue eye pendant she\u0027d given me. \"This thing you gave me. It\u0027s a n-nazari\" I stumbled over the word. She looked surprised.\n \"Yes. How\u0027d you know?\"\n I didn\u0027t want to explain my dreams with Adrian. \"Someone told me. It\u0027s a protection thing, right?\"\n A pensive look crossed her face, and then she exhaled and nodded. \"Yes. It comes from an old superstition in the Middle East...Some people believe that those who want to hurt you can curse you or give you \u0027the evil eye.\u0027 The nazar is meant to counteract the evil eye ... and just bring protection in general to those who wear it.\"\n I ran my fingers over the piece of glass. \"Middle East...so, places sort of like, um, Turkey?\"\n My mother\u0027s lips quirked. \"Places exactly like Turkey.\" She hesitated. \"It was ... a gift. A gift I received a long time ago ...\" Her gaze turned inward, lost in memory. \"I got a lot of ... attention from men when I was your age. Attention that seemed flattering at first but wasn\u0027t in the end. It\u0027s hard to tell the difference sometimes, between what\u0027s real affection and what\u0027s someone wanting to take advantage of you. But when you feel the real thing...well, you\u0027ll know.\"\n I understood then why she was so overprotective about my reputation- she\u0027d endangered her own when she was younger. Maybe more than that had been damaged.\n I also knew why she\u0027d given the nazar to me. My father had given it to her. I didn\u0027t think she wanted to talk anymore about it, so I didn\u0027t ask. It was enough to know that maybe, just maybe, their relationship hadn\u0027t been all about business and genes after all.\n We said goodbye, and I returned to my classes. Everyone knew where I\u0027d been that morning, and my fellow novices wanted to see my molnija marks. I didn\u0027t blame them. If our roles had been reversed, I would have been harassing me too.\n \"Come on, Rose,\" begged Shane Reyes. We were walking out of our morning practice, and he kept swatting my ponytail. I made a mental note to wear my hair down tomorrow. Several others followed us and echoed his requests.\n \"Yeah, come on. Let\u0027s see what you got for your swordsmanship!\"\n Their eyes shone with eagerness and excitement. I was a hero, their classmate who\u0027d dispatched the leaders of the roving band of Strigoi that had so terrorized us over the holidays. But I met the eyes of someone standing at the back of the group, someone who looked neither eager nor excited. Eddie. Meeting my gaze, he gave me a small, sad smile. He understood.\n \"Sorry, guys,\" I said, turning back to the others. \"They have to stay bandaged. Doctor\u0027s orders.\"\n This was met with grumbles that soon turned into questions about how I\u0027d actually killed the Strigoi. Decapitation was one of the hardest and rarest ways to kill a vampire; it wasn\u0027t like carrying a sword was convenient. So I did my best to tell my friends what had happened, making sure to stick to the facts and not glorify the killings.\n The school day couldn\u0027t end a moment too soon, and Lissa walked with me back to my dorm. She and I hadn\u0027t had the chance to talk much since everything had gone down in Spokane. I\u0027d undergone a lot of questioning, and then there\u0027d been Mason\u0027s funeral. Lissa had also been caught up in her own distractions with the royals leaving campus, so she\u0027d had no more free time than me.\n Being near her made me feel better. Even though I could be in her head at any time, it just wasn\u0027t the same as actually being physically around another living person who cared about you.\n When we got to the door of my room, I saw a bouquet of freesias sitting on the floor near it. Sighing, I picked up the fragrant flowers without even looking at the attached card.\n \"What are those?\" asked Lissa while I unlocked the door.\n \"They\u0027re from Adrian,\" I told her. We walked inside, and I pointed to my desk, where a few other bouquets sat. I put the freesias down beside them. \"I\u0027ll be glad when he leaves campus. I don\u0027t think I can take much more of this.\"\n She turned to me in surprise. \"Oh. Um, you don\u0027t know.\"\n I got that warning twinge through the bond that told me I wouldn\u0027t like what was about to come.\n \"Know what?\"\n \"Uh, he isn\u0027t leaving. He\u0027s going to stay here for a while.\"\n \"He has to leave,\" I argued. To my knowledge, the only reason he\u0027d come back at all was because of Mason\u0027s funeral, and I still wasn\u0027t sure why he\u0027d done that, since he barely knew Mason. Maybe Adrian had just done it for show. Or maybe to keep stalking Lissa and me. \"He\u0027s in college. Or maybe reform school. I don\u0027t know, but he does something.\"\n \"He\u0027s taking the semester off.\"\n I stared.\n Smiling at my shock, she nodded. \"He\u0027s going to stay and work with me... and Ms. Carmack. All this time, he never even knew what spirit was. He just knew he hadn\u0027t specialized but that he had these weird abilities. He just kept them to himself, except for when he occasionally found another spirit user. But they didn\u0027t know any more than he did.\"\n \"I should have figured it out sooner,\" I mused. \"There was something about being around him. ... I always wanted to talk to him, you know? He just has this ... charisma. Like you do. I guess it\u0027s all tied into spirit and compulsion or whatever. It makes me like him ... even though I don\u0027t like him.\"\n \"Don\u0027t you?\" she teased.\n \"No,\" I replied adamantly. \"And I don\u0027t like that dream thing, either.\"\n Her jade eyes went wide with wonder. \"That is cool,\" she said. \"You\u0027ve always been able to tell what\u0027s going on with me, but I\u0027ve never been able to communicate with you the other way. I\u0027m glad you guys got away when you did...but I wish I could have figured out the dream thing and helped find you.\"\n \"Not me,\" I said. \"I\u0027m glad Adrian didn\u0027t get you to go off your meds.\"\n I hadn\u0027t found that out until a few days after being in Spokane. Lissa had apparently rejected Adrian\u0027s initial suggestion that stopping the pills would let her learn more about spirit. She had admitted to me later, however, that if Christian and I had stayed missing much longer, she might have cracked.\n \"How are you feeling lately?\" I asked, recalling her concerns about the medication. \"You still feel like the pills aren\u0027t working?\"\n \"Mmm...well, it\u0027s hard to explain. I still feel closer to the magic, like maybe they aren\u0027t blocking me so much anymore. But I\u0027m not feeling any of the other mental side effects...not upset or anything.\"\n \"Wow, that\u0027s great.\"\n A beautiful smile lit her face. \"I know. It makes me think there might be hope for me to learn to work the magic after all someday.\"\n Seeing her so happy made me smile back. I hadn\u0027t liked seeing those dark feelings starting to return and was glad they\u0027d vanished. I didn\u0027t understand the how or the why, but as long as she felt okay-\n Everyone has light around them, except for you. You have shadows. You take them from Lissa.\n Adrian\u0027s words slammed into my mind. Uneasily, I thought about my behavior these last couple of weeks. Some of the angry outbursts. My rebelliousness- unusual even for me. My own black coil of emotion, stirring in my chest...\n No, I decided. There were no similarities. Lissa\u0027s dark feelings were magic-based. Mine were stress-based. Besides, I felt fine right now.\n Seeing her watching me, I tried to remember where we\u0027d left off in the conversation. \"Maybe you\u0027ll eventually find a way to make it work. I mean, if Adrian could find a way to use spirit and doesn\u0027t need meds ...\"\n She suddenly laughed. \"You don\u0027t know, do you?\"\n \"What?\"\n \"That Adrian does medicate himself.\"\n \"He does? But he said- \" I groaned. \"Of course he does. The cigarettes. The drinking. God only knows what else.\"\n She nodded. \"Yup. He\u0027s almost always got something in his system.\"\n \"But probably not at night...which is why he can poke his head into my dreams.\"\n \"Man, I wish I could do that,\" she sighed.\n \"Maybe you\u0027ll learn someday. Just don\u0027t become an alcoholic in the process.\"\n \"I won\u0027t,\" she assured me. \"But I will learn. None of the other spirit users could do it, Rose- well, aside from St. Vladimir. I\u0027ll learn like he did. I\u0027m going to learn to use it- and I won\u0027t let it hurt me.\"\n I smiled and touched her hand. I had absolute faith in her. \"I know.\"\n We talked for most of the evening. When the time came for my usual practice with Dimitri, I parted ways with her. As I walked away, I pondered something that had been bothering me. Although the attacking groups of Strigoi had had many more members, the guardians felt confident Isaiah had been their leader. That didn\u0027t mean there wouldn\u0027t be other threats in the future, but they felt it\u0027d be a while before his followers regrouped.\n But I couldn\u0027t help thinking about the list I\u0027d seen in the tunnel in Spokane, the one that had listed royal families by size. And Isaiah had mentioned the Dragomirs by name. He knew they were almost gone, and he\u0027d sounded keen on being the one to finish them. Sure, he was dead now...but were there other Strigoi out there with the same idea?\n I shook my head. I couldn\u0027t worry about that. Not today. I still needed to recover from everything else. Soon, though. Soon I\u0027d have to deal with this.\n I didn\u0027t even know if our practice was still on but went to the locker room anyway. After changing into practice clothes, I headed down into the gym and found Dimitri in a supply room, reading one of the Western novels he loved. He looked up at my entrance. I\u0027d seen little of him in these last few days and had figured he was busy with Tasha.\n \"I thought you might come by,\" he said, putting a bookmark between the pages.\n \"It\u0027s time for practice.\"\n He shook his head. \"No. No practice today. You still need to recover.\"\n \"I\u0027ve got a clean bill of health. I\u0027m good to go.\" I pushed as much patented Rose Hathaway bravado into my words as I could.\n Dimitri wasn\u0027t falling for any of it. He gestured to the chair beside him. \"Sit down, Rose.\"\n I hesitated only a moment before complying. He moved his own chair close to mine so that we sat directly across from each other. My heart fluttered as I looked into those gorgeous dark eyes.\n \"No one gets over their first kill...kills...easily. Even with Strigoi...well, it\u0027s still technically taking a life. That\u0027s hard to come to terms with. And after everything else you went through ...\" He sighed, then reached out and caught my hand in his. His fingers were exactly like I remembered, long and powerful, calloused with years of training. \"When I saw your face...when we found you in that house...you can\u0027t imagine how I felt.\"\n I swallowed. \"How ... how did you feel?\"\n \"Devastated ... grief-stricken. You were alive, but the way you looked ... I didn\u0027t think you\u0027d ever recover. And it tore me apart to think of that happening to you so young.\" He squeezed my hand. \"You will recover- I know that now, and I\u0027m glad. But you aren\u0027t there. Not yet. Losing someone you care about is never easy.\"\n My eyes dropped from his and studied the floor. \"It\u0027s my fault,\" I said in a small voice.\n \"Hmm?\"\n \"Mason. Getting killed.\"\n I didn\u0027t have to see Dimitri\u0027s face to know compassion was filling it. \"Oh, Roza. No. You made some bad decisions...you should have told others when you knew he was gone...but you can\u0027t blame yourself. You didn\u0027t kill him.\"\n Tears brimmed in my eyes as I looked back up. \"I might as well have. The whole reason he went there- it was my fault. We had a fight...and I told him about the Spokane thing, even though you asked me not to....\"\n One tear leaked out of the corner of my eye. Really, I needed to learn to stop that. Just as my mother had, Dimitri delicately wiped the tear off my cheek.\n \"You can\u0027t blame yourself for that,\" he told me. \"You can regret your decisions and wish you\u0027d done things differently, but in the end, Mason made his decisions too. That was what he chose to do. It was his decision in the end, no matter your original role.\" When Mason had come back for me, I realized, he\u0027d let his feelings for me get in the way. It was what Dimitri had always feared, that if he and I had any sort of relationship, it would put us- and any Moroi we protected- in danger.\n \"I just wish I\u0027d been able to ... I don\u0027t know, do anything...\"\n Swallowing back further tears, I pulled my hands from Dimitri\u0027s and stood up before I could say something stupid.\n \"I should go,\" I said thickly. \"Let me know when you want to start practice again. And thanks for ... talking.\"\n I started to turn; then I heard him say abruptly, \"No.\"\n I glanced back. \"What?\"\n He held my gaze, and something warm and wonderful and powerful shot between us.\n \"No,\" he repeated. \"I told her no. Tasha.\"\n \"I ...\" I shut my mouth before my jaw hit the floor. \"But...why? That was a once-in-a-lifetime thing. You could have had a baby. And she ... she was, you know, into you....\"\n The ghost of a smile flickered on his face. \"Yes, she was. Is. And that\u0027s why I had to say no. I couldn\u0027t return that...couldn\u0027t give her what she wanted. Not when...\" He took a few steps toward me. \"Not when my heart is somewhere else.\"\n I almost started crying again. \"But you seemed so into her. And you kept going on about how young I acted.\"\n \"You act young,\" he said, \"because you are young. But you know things, Roza. Things people older than you don\u0027t even know. That day ...\" I knew instantly which day he referred to. The one up against the wall. \"You were right, about how I fight to stay in control. No one else has ever figured that out- and it scared me. You scare me.\"\n \"Why? Don\u0027t you want anyone to know?\"\n He shrugged. \"Whether they know that fact or not doesn\u0027t matter. What matters is that someone- that you- know me that well. When a person can see into your soul, it\u0027s hard. It forces you to be open. Vulnerable. It\u0027s much easier being with someone who\u0027s just more of a casual friend.\"\n \"Like Tasha.\"\n \"Tasha Ozera is an amazing woman. She\u0027s beautiful and she\u0027s brave. But she doesn\u0027t- \"\n \"She doesn\u0027t get you,\" I finished.\n He nodded. \"I knew that. But I still wanted the relationship. I knew it would be easy and that she could take me away from you. I thought she could make me forget you.\"\n I\u0027d thought the same thing about Mason. \"But she couldn\u0027t.\"\n \"Yes. And, so ... that\u0027s a problem.\"\n \"Because it\u0027s wrong for us to be together.\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"Because of the age difference.\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"But more importantly because we\u0027re going to be Lissa\u0027s guardians and need to focus on her- not each other.\"\n \"Yes.\"\n I thought about this for a moment and then looked straight into his eyes. \"Well,\" I said at last, \"the way I see it, we aren\u0027t Lissa\u0027s guardians yet.\"\n I steeled myself for the next response. I knew it was going to be one of the Zen life lessons. Something about inner strength and perseverance, about how the choices we made today were templates for the future or some other nonsense.\n Instead he kissed me.\n Time stopped as he reached out and cupped my face between his hands. He brought his mouth down and brushed it against my lips. It was barely a kiss at first but soon increased, becoming heady and deep. When he finally pulled away, it was to kiss my forehead. He left his lips there for several seconds as his arms held me close.\n I wished the kiss could have gone on forever. Breaking the embrace, he ran a few fingers through my hair and down my cheek. He stepped back toward the door.\n \"I\u0027ll see you later, Roza.\"\n \"At our next practice?\" I asked. \"We are starting those up again, right? I mean, you still have things to teach me.\"\n Standing in the doorway, he looked over at me and smiled. \"Yes. Lots of things.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/frostbite-vampire-academy-2/page-24.html","bookId":2061,"book":{"id":2061,"title":"Frostbite (Vampire Academy #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Vampire Academy Series 2: Frostbite \n Rose loves Dimitri, Dimitri might love Tasha, and Mason would die to be with Rose... \n It\u0027s winter break at St. Vladimir\u0027s, but Rose is feeling anything but festive.
