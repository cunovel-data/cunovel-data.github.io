A good night\u0027s sleep had gone far to chase away the images from last night, but I knew neither I nor my classmates would easily forget what had taken place outside Billings.\n And yet, as I studied the faces and clusters of other novices, I noticed something weird. The fear and tension from yesterday were still around, certainly, but something new was there too: excitement. A couple of freshmen novices were practically squealing with joy as they spoke in hushed whispers. Nearby, a group of guys my own age were gesturing wildly, enthusiastic grins on their faces.\n I had to be missing something here¡ªunless all of yesterday had been a dream. It took every ounce of self-control I had not to go over and ask somebody what was happening. If I delayed, I\u0027d be late for practice. The curiosity was killing me, though. Had the Strigoi and their humans been found and killed? That would certainly be good news, but something told me that wasn\u0027t the case. Pushing open the front doors, I lamented that I\u0027d just have to wait until breakfast to find out.\n \"Hath-away, don\u0027t run-away,\" a singsong voice called.\n I glanced behind me and grinned. Mason Ashford, another novice and a good friend of mine, jogged up and fell in step with me.\n \"What are you, twelve?\" I asked, continuing on toward the gym.\n \"Nearly,\" he said. \"I missed your smiling face yesterday. Where were you?\"\n Apparently my presence at the Badica house still wasn\u0027t widely known. It wasn\u0027t a secret or anything, but I didn\u0027t want to discuss any gory details. \"Had a training thing with Dimitri.\"\n \"God,\" muttered Mason. \"That guy is always working you. Doesn\u0027t he realize he\u0027s depriving us of your beauty and charm?\"\n \"Smiling face? Beauty and charm? You\u0027re laying it on a little thick this morning, aren\u0027t you?\" I laughed.\n \"Hey, I\u0027m just telling it like it is. Really, you\u0027re lucky to have someone as suave and brilliant as me paying this much attention to you.\"\n I kept grinning. Mason was a huge flirt, and he liked to flirt with me in particular. Part of it was just because I was good at it and liked to flirt back. But I knew his feelings toward me were more than just friendly, and I was still deciding how I felt about that. He and I had the same goofy sense of humor and frequently drew attention to ourselves in class and among friends. He had gorgeous blue eyes and messy red hair that never seemed to lie flat. It was cute.\n But dating someone new was going to be kind of difficult when I still kept thinking about the time I was half-naked in bed with Dimitri.\n \"Suave and brilliant, huh?\" I shook my head. \"I don\u0027t think you pay nearly as much attention to me as you do your ego. Someone needs to knock it down a little.\"\n \"Oh yeah?\" he asked. \"Well, you can try your best on the slopes.\"\n I stopped walking. \"The what?\"\n \"The slopes.\" He tilted his head. \"You know, the ski trip.\"\n \"What ski trip?\" I was apparently missing something serious here.\n \"Where have you been this morning?\" he asked, looking at me like I was a crazy woman.\n \"In bed! I only got up, like, five minutes ago. Now, start from the beginning and tell me what you\u0027re talking about.\" I shivered from the lack of movement. \"And let\u0027s keep walking.\" We did.\n \"So, you know how everyone\u0027s afraid to have their kids come home for Christmas? Well, there\u0027s this huge ski lodge in Idaho that\u0027s exclusively used by royals and rich Moroi. The people who own it are opening it up for Academy students and their families¡ªand actually any other Moroi who want to go. With everyone in one spot, they\u0027re going to have a ton of guardians to protect the place, so it\u0027ll be totally safe.\"\n \"You can\u0027t be serious,\" I said. We reached the gym and stepped inside out of the cold.\n Mason nodded eagerly. \"It\u0027s true. The place is supposed to be amazing.\" He gave me the grin that always made me smile in return. \"We\u0027re going to live like royalty, Rose. At least for a week or so. We take off the day after Christmas.\"\n I stood there, both excited and stunned. I hadn\u0027t seen this coming. It really was a brilliant idea, one that let families reunite safely. And what a reunion spot! A royal ski lodge. I\u0027d expected to spend most of my holiday break hanging out here and watching TV with Lissa and Christian. Now I\u0027d be living it up in five-star accommodations. Lobster dinners. Massages. Cute ski instructors ...\n Mason\u0027s enthusiasm was contagious. I could feel it welling up in me, and then, suddenly, it slammed to a halt.\n Studying my face, he saw the change right away. \"What\u0027s wrong? This is cool.\"\n \"It is,\" I admitted. \"And I get why everyone\u0027s excited, but the reason we\u0027re getting to go to this fancy place is because, well, because people are dead. I mean, doesn\u0027t this all seem weird?\"\n Mason\u0027s cheery expression sobered a little. \"Yeah, but we\u0027re alive, Rose. We can\u0027t stop living because other people are dead. And we have to make sure more people don\u0027t die. That\u0027s why this place is such a great idea. It\u0027s safe.\" His eyes turned stormy. \"God, I can\u0027t wait until we\u0027re out of here in the field. After hearing about what happened, I just want to go tear apart some Strigoi. I wish we could go now, you know? There\u0027s no reason. They could use the extra help, and we pretty much know everything we need to.\"\n The fierceness in his voice reminded me of my outburst yesterday, though he wasn\u0027t quite as worked up as I\u0027d been. His eagerness to act was impetuous and na?ve, whereas mine had been born out of some weird, dark irrationality I still didn\u0027t entirely understand.\n When I didn\u0027t respond, Mason gave me a puzzled look. \"Don\u0027t you want to?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know, Mase.\" I stared down at the floor, avoiding his eyes as I studied the toe of my shoe. \"I mean, I don\u0027t want Strigoi out there, attacking people either. And I want to stop them in theory... but, well, we aren\u0027t even close to being ready. I\u0027ve seen what they can do I don\u0027t know. Rushing in isn\u0027t the answer.\" I shook my head and looked back up. Good grief. I sounded so logical and cautious. I sounded like Dimitri. \"It\u0027s not important since it\u0027s not going to happen anyway. I suppose we should just be excited about the trip, huh?\"\n Mason\u0027s moods were quick to change, and he turned easygoing once more. \"Yup. And you\u0027d better try to remember how to ski, because I\u0027m calling you out on knocking down my ego out there. Not that it\u0027s going to happen.\"\n I smiled again. \"Boy, it sure is going to be sad when I make you cry. I kind of feel guilty already.\"\n He opened his mouth, no doubt to deliver some smartass reply, and then caught sight of something¡ªor rather, someone¡ªbehind me. I glanced over and saw Dimitri\u0027s tall form approaching from the other side of the gym.\n Mason swept me a gallant bow. \"Your lord and master. Catch you later, Hathaway. Start planning your ski strategies.\" He opened the door and disappeared into the frigid darkness. I turned around and joined Dimitri.\n Like other dhampir novices, I spent half of my school day on one form or another of guardian training, be it actual physical combat or learning about Strigoi and how to defend against them. Novices also sometimes had practices after school. I, however, was in a unique situation.\n I still stood by my decision to run away from St. Vladimir\u0027s. Victor Dashkov had posed too much of a threat to Lissa. But our extended vacation had come with consequences. Being away for two years had put me behind in my guardian classes, so the school had declared that I had to make up for it by going to extra practices before and after school.\n With Dimitri.\n Little did they know that they were also giving me lessons in avoiding temptation. But my attraction to him aside, I was a fast learner, and with his help, I had almost caught up to the other seniors.\n Since he wasn\u0027t wearing a coat, I knew we\u0027d be working inside today, which was good news. It was freezing out. Yet even the happiness I felt over that was nothing compared to what I felt when I saw what exactly he had set up in one of the training rooms.\n There were practice dummies arranged on the far wall, dummies that looked amazingly lifelike. No straw-stuffed burlap bags here. There were men and women, wearing ordinary clothes, with rubbery skin and different hair and eye colors. Their expressions ranged from happy to scared to angry. I\u0027d worked with these dummies before in other trainings, using them to practice kicks and punches. But I\u0027d never worked with them while holding what Dimitri held: a silver stake.\n \"Sweet,\" I breathed.\n It was identical to the one I\u0027d found at the Badica house. It had a hand grip at the bottom, almost like a hilt without the little side flourishes. That was where its resemblance to a dagger ended. Rather than a flat blade, the stake had a thick, rounded body that narrowed to a point, kind of like an ice pick. The entire thing was a little shorter than my forearm.\n Dimitri leaned casually against the wall, in an easy stance he always pulled off remarkably well, despite being almost six-seven. With one hand, he tossed the stake into the air. It spun around in a cartwheel a couple of times and then came down. He caught it hilt first.\n \"Please tell me I get to learn how to do that today,\" I said.\n Amusement flashed in the dark depths of his eyes. I think he had a hard time keeping a straight face around me sometimes.\n \"You\u0027ll be lucky if I let you hold it today,\" he said. He flipped the stake into the air again. My eyes followed it longingly. I started to point out that I had already held one, but I knew that line of logic would get me nowhere.\n Instead, I tossed my backpack on the floor, threw off my coat, and crossed my arms expectantly. I had on loose pants tied at the waist and a tank top with a hoodie over it. My dark hair was pulled brutally back into a ponytail. I was ready for anything.\n \"You want me to tell you how they work and why I should always be cautious around them,\" I announced.\n Dimitri stopped flipping the stake and stared at me in astonishment.\n \"Come on,\" I laughed. \"You don\u0027t think I know how you work by now? We\u0027ve been doing this for almost three months. You always make me talk safety and responsibility before I can do anything fun.\"\n \"I see,\" he said. \"Well, I guess you\u0027ve got it all figured out. By all means, go on with the lesson. I\u0027ll just wait over here until you need me again.\"\n He tucked the stake into a leather sheath hanging from his belt and then made himself comfortable against the wall, hands stuffed in pockets. I waited, figuring he was joking, but when he said nothing else, I realized he\u0027d meant his words. With a shrug, I launched into what I knew.\n \"Silver always has powerful effects on any magical creature¡ªit can help or hurt them if you put enough power into it. These stakes are really hard-core because it takes four different Moroi to make them, and they use each of the elements during the forging.\" I frowned, suddenly considering something. \"Well, except spirit. So these things are supercharged and are about the only non-decapitating weapon that can do damage to a Strigoi¡ªbut to kill them, it has to be through the heart.\"\n \"Will they hurt you?\"\n I shook my head. \"No. I mean, well, yeah, if you drive one through my heart it will, but it won\u0027t hurt me like it would a Moroi. Scratch one of them with this, and it\u0027ll hit them pretty hard¡ªbut not as hard as it\u0027d hit a Strigoi. And they won\u0027t hurt humans, either.\"\n I stopped for a moment and stared absentmindedly at the window behind Dimitri. Frost covered the glass in sparkling, crystalline patterns, but I hardly noticed. Mentioning humans and stakes had transported me back to the Badica house. Blood and death flashed through my thoughts.\n Seeing Dimitri watching me, I shook off the memories and kept going with the lesson. Dimitri would occasionally give a nod or ask a clarifying question. As the time ticked down, I kept expecting him to tell me I was finished and could start hacking up the dummies. Instead, he waited until almost ten minutes before the end of our session before leading me over to one of them¡ªit was a man with blond hair and a goatee. Dimitri took the stake out from its sheath but didn\u0027t hand it to me.\n \"Where are you going to put this?\" he asked.\n \"In the heart,\" I replied irritably. \"I already told you that like a hundred times. Can I have it now?\"\n He allowed himself a smile. \"Where\u0027s the heart?\"\n I gave him an are-you-serious look. He merely shrugged.\n With overdramatic emphasis, I pointed to the left side of the dummy\u0027s chest. Dimitri shook his head.\n \"That\u0027s not where the heart is,\" he told me.\n \"Sure it is. People put their hands over their hearts when they say the Pledge of Allegiance or sing the national anthem.\"\n He continued to stare at me expectantly.\n I turned back to the dummy and studied it. In the back of my brain, I remembered learning CPR and where we had to place our hands. I tapped the center of the dummy\u0027s chest.\n \"Is it here?\"\n He arched an eyebrow. Normally I thought that was cool. Today it was just annoying. \"I don\u0027t know,\" he said. \"Is it?\"\n \"That\u0027s what I\u0027m asking you!\"\n \"You shouldn\u0027t have to ask me. Don\u0027t you all have to take physiology?\"\n \"Yeah. Junior year. I was on \u0027vacation,\u0027 remember?\" I pointed to the gleaming stake. \"Can I please touch it now?\"\n He flipped the stake again, letting it flash in the light, and then it disappeared in the sheath. \"I want you to tell me where the heart is the next time we meet. Exactly where. And I want to know what\u0027s in the way of it too.\"\n I gave him my fiercest glare, which¡ªjudging from his expression¡ªmust not have been that fierce. Nine out of ten times, I thought Dimitri was the sexiest thing walking the earth. Then, there were times like this ...\n I headed off to first period, a combat class, in a bad mood. I didn\u0027t like looking incompetent in front of Dimitri, and I\u0027d really, really wanted to use one of those stakes. So in class I took out my annoyance on anyone I could punch or kick. By the end of class, no one wanted to spar with me. I\u0027d accidentally hit Meredith¡ªone of the few other girls in my class¡ªso hard that she\u0027d felt it through her shin padding. She was going to have an ugly bruise and kept looking at me as though I\u0027d done it on purpose. I apologized to no avail.\n Afterward, Mason found me once again. \"Oh, man,\" he said, studying my face. \"Who pissed you off?\"\n I immediately launched into my tale of silver stake and heart woes.\n To my annoyance, he laughed. \"How do you not know where the heart is? Especially considering how many of them you\u0027ve broken?\"\n I gave him the same ferocious look I\u0027d given Dimitri. This time, it worked. Mason\u0027s face paled.\n \"Belikov is a sick, evil man who should be thrown into a pit of rabid vipers for the great offense he committed against you this morning.\"\n \"Thank you.\" I said primly. Then, I considered. \"Can vipers be rabid?\"\n \"I don\u0027t see why not. Everything can be. I think.\" He held the hallway door open for me. \"Canadian geese might be worse than vipers, though.\"\n I gave him a sidelong look. \"Canadian geese are deadlier than vipers?\"\n \"You ever tried to feed those little bastards?\" he asked, attempting seriousness and failing. \"They\u0027re vicious. You get thrown to vipers, you die quickly. But the geese? That\u0027ll go on for days. More suffering.\"\n \"Wow. I don\u0027t know whether I should be impressed or frightened that you\u0027ve thought about all this,\" I remarked.\n \"Just trying to find creative ways to avenge your honor, that\u0027s all.\"\n \"You just never struck me as the creative type, Mase.\"\n We stood just outside our second-period classroom. Mason\u0027s expression was still light and joking, but there was a suggestive note in his voice when he spoke again. \"Rose, when I\u0027m around you, I think of all sorts of creative things to do.\"\n I was still giggling about the vipers and abruptly stopped, staring at him in surprise. I\u0027d always thought Mason was cute, but with that serious, smoky look in his eyes, it suddenly occurred to me for the first time that he was actually kind of sexy.\n \"Oh, look at that,\" he laughed, noticing how much he\u0027d caught me off guard. \"Rose gets rendered speechless. Ashford 1, Hathaway 0.\"\n \"Hey, I don\u0027t want to make you cry before the trip. It won\u0027t be any fun if I\u0027ve already broken you before we even hit the slopes.\"\n He laughed, and we stepped into the room. This was a class on bodyguard theory, one that took place in an actual classroom instead of the practice field. It was a nice break from all the physical exertion. Today, there were three guardians standing at the front who weren\u0027t from the school\u0027s regiment. Holiday visitors, I realized. Parents and their guardians had already started coming to campus to accompany their children to the ski resort. My interest was piqued immediately.\n One of the guests was a tall guy who looked like he was about a hundred years old but could still kick major ass. The other guy was about Dimitri\u0027s age. He had deeply tanned skin and was built well enough that a few of the girls in class looked ready to swoon.\n The last guardian was a woman. Her auburn hair was cropped and curly, and her brown eyes were currently narrowed in thought. As I\u0027ve said, a lot of dhampir women choose to have children rather than follow the guardian path. Since I too was one of the few women in this profession, I was always excited to meet others¡ªlike Tamara.\n Only, this wasn\u0027t Tamara. This was someone I\u0027d known for years, someone who triggered anything but pride and excitement. Instead, I felt resentment. Resentment, anger, and burning outrage.\n The woman standing in front of the class was my mother. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/frostbite-vampire-academy-2/page-4.html","bookId":2061,"book":{"id":2061,"title":"Frostbite (Vampire Academy #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Vampire Academy Series 2: Frostbite \n Rose loves Dimitri, Dimitri might love Tasha, and Mason would die to be with Rose... \n It\u0027s winter break at St. Vladimir\u0027s, but Rose is feeling anything but festive.
