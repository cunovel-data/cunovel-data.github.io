{"id":110629,"no":23,"title":"Page 23","content":"TWENTY-TWO HORROR AND SHOCK CONSUMED ME, so much so that I thought my soul would shrivel, that the world would end right then and there- because surely, surely it couldn\u0027t keep going on after this. No one could keep going on after this. I wanted to shriek my pain to the universe. I wanted to cry until I melted. I wanted to sink down beside Mason and die with him. Elena released me, apparently deciding I posed no danger positioned as I was between her and Isaiah. She turned toward Mason\u0027s body. And I stopped feeling. I simply acted. \"Don\u0027t. Touch. Him.\" I didn\u0027t recognize my own voice. She rolled her eyes. \"Good grief, you\u0027re annoying. I\u0027m started to see Isaiah\u0027s point- you do need to suffer before dying.\" Turning away, she knelt down to the floor and flipped Mason over onto his back. \"Don\u0027t touch him!\" I screamed. I shoved her with little effect. She shoved back, nearly knocking me over. It was all I could do to steady my feet and stay upright. Isaiah looked on with amused interest; then his gaze fell to the floor. Lissa\u0027s chotki had fallen out of my coat pocket. He picked it up. Strigoi could touch holy objects- the stories about them fearing crosses weren\u0027t true. They just couldn\u0027t enter holy ground. He flipped the cross over and ran his fingers over the etched dragon. \"Ah, the Dragomirs,\" he mused. \"I\u0027d forgotten about them. Easy to. There\u0027s what, one? Two of them left? Barely worth remembering.\" Those horrible red eyes focused on me. \"Do you know any of them? I\u0027ll have to see to them one of these days. It won\u0027t be very hard to- \" Suddenly, I heard an explosion. The aquarium burst apart as water shot out of it, shattering the glass. Pieces of it flew toward me, but I barely noticed. The water coalesced in the air, forming a lopsided sphere. It began to float. Toward Isaiah. I felt my jaw drop as I stared at it. He watched it too, more puzzled than scared. At least until it wrapped around his face and started suffocating him. Much like the bullets, suffocation wouldn\u0027t kill him. But it could cause him a hell of a lot of discomfort. His hands flew to his face, desperately trying to \"pry\" the water away. It was no use. His fingers simply slipped through. Elena forgot about Mason and jumped to her feet. \"What is it?\" she shrieked. She shook him in an equally useless effort to free him. \"What\u0027s happening?\" Again, I didn\u0027t feel. I acted. My hand closed around a large piece of glass from the broken aquarium. It was jagged and sharp, cutting into my hand. Sprinting forward, I plunged the shard into Isaiah\u0027s chest, aiming for the heart I\u0027d worked so hard to find in practice. Isaiah emitted a strangled scream through the water and collapsed to the floor. His eyes rolled back in his head as he blacked out from the pain. Elena stared, as shocked as I\u0027d been when Isaiah had killed Mason. Isaiah wasn\u0027t dead, of course, but he was temporarily down for the count. Her face clearly showed she hadn\u0027t thought that was possible. The smart thing at that point would have been to run toward the door and the sun\u0027s safety. Instead, I ran in the opposite direction, toward the fireplace. I grabbed one of the antique swords and turned back toward Elena. I didn\u0027t have far to go, because she\u0027d recovered herself and was heading toward me. Snarling with rage, she tried to grab me. I had never trained with a sword, but I had been taught to fight with any makeshift weapon I could find. I used the sword to keep distance between us, my motions clumsy but effective for the time being. White fangs flashed in her mouth. \"I am going to make you- \" \"Suffer, pay, regret I was ever born?\" I suggested. I remembered fighting with my mom, how I\u0027d been on the defensive the whole time. That wouldn\u0027t work this time. I had to attack. Jabbing forward, I tried to land a blow on Elena. No luck. She anticipated my every move. Suddenly, from behind her, Isaiah groaned as he started to come around. She glanced back, the smallest of motions that let me swipe the sword across her chest. It cut the fabric of her shirt and grazed the skin, but nothing more. Still, she flinched and looked down in panic. I think the glass going through Isaiah\u0027s heart was still fresh in her mind. And that was what I really needed. I mustered all my strength, drew back, and swung. The sword\u0027s blade hit the side of her neck, hard and deep. She gave a horrible, sickening cry, a shriek that made my skin crawl. She tried to move toward me. I pulled back and hit again. Her hands clutched at her throat, and her knees gave way. I struck and struck, the sword digging deeper into her neck each time. Cutting off someone\u0027s head was harder than I\u0027d thought it would be. The old, dull sword probably wasn\u0027t helping. But finally, I gained enough sense to realize she wasn\u0027t moving. Her head lay there, detached from her body, her dead eyes looking up at me as though she couldn\u0027t believe what had happened. That made two of us. Someone was screaming, and for a surreal second, I thought it was still Elena. Then I lifted my eyes and looked across the room. Mia stood in the doorway, eyes bugging out and skin tinged green like she might throw up. Distantly, in the back of my mind, I realized she was the one who\u0027d made the aquarium explode. Water magic apparently wasn\u0027t worthless after all. Still a bit shaken, Isaiah tried to rise to his feet. But I was on him before he could fully manage it. The sword sang out, wreaking blood and pain with each blow. I felt like an old pro now. Isaiah fell back to the floor. In my mind, I kept seeing him break Mason\u0027s neck, and I hacked and hacked as hard as I could, as though striking fiercely enough might somehow banish the memory. \"Rose! Rose!\" Through my hate-filled haze, I just barely detected Mia\u0027s voice. \"Rose, he\u0027s dead!\" Slowly, shakily, I held back the next blow and looked down at his body- and the head no longer attached to it. She was right. He was dead. Very, very dead. I looked at the rest of the room. There was blood everywhere, but the horror of it didn\u0027t really register with me. My world had slowed down, slowed down to two very simple tasks. Kill the Strigoi. Protect Mason. I couldn\u0027t process anything else. \"Rose,\" whispered Mia. She was trembling, her words filled with fear. She was afraid of me, not the Strigoi. \"Rose, we have to go. Come on.\" I dragged my eyes away from her and looked down at Isaiah\u0027s remains. After several moments, I crawled over to Mason\u0027s body, still clutching the sword. \"No,\" I croaked out. \"I can\u0027t leave him. Other Strigoi might come....\" My eyes burned like I desperately wanted to cry. I couldn\u0027t say for sure. The bloodlust still pounded in me, violence and rage the only emotions I was capable of anymore. \"Rose, we\u0027ll come back for him. If other Strigoi are coming, we have to get out.\" \"No,\" I repeated, not even looking at her. \"I\u0027m not leaving him. I won\u0027t leave him alone.\" With my free hand, I stroked Mason\u0027s hair. \"Rose- \" I jerked my head up. \"Get out!\" I screamed at her. \"Get out, and leave us alone.\" She took a few steps forward, and I lifted the sword. She froze. \"Get out,\" I repeated. \"Go find the others.\" Slowly, Mia backed up toward the door. She gave me one last, desperate look before running outside. Silence fell, and I relaxed my hold on the sword but refused to let it go. My body sagged forward, and I rested my head on Mason\u0027s chest. I became oblivious to everything: to the world around me, to time itself. Seconds could have passed. Hours could have passed. I didn\u0027t know. I didn\u0027t know anything except that I couldn\u0027t leave Mason alone. I existed in an altered state, a state that just barely kept the terror and grief at bay. I couldn\u0027t believe Mason was dead. I couldn\u0027t believe I\u0027d just summoned death. So long as I refused to acknowledge either, I could pretend they hadn\u0027t happened. Footsteps and voices eventually sounded, and I lifted my head up. People poured in through the door, lots of them. I couldn\u0027t really make out any of them. I didn\u0027t need to. They were threats, threats I had to keep Mason safe from. A couple of them approached me, and I leapt up, lifting the sword and holding it protectively over his body. \"Stay back,\" I warned. \"Stay away from him.\" They kept coming. \"Stay back!\" I yelled. They stopped. Except for one. \"Rose,\" came a soft voice. \"Drop the sword.\" My hands shook. I swallowed. \"Get away from us.\" \"Rose.\" The voice spoke again, a voice that my soul would have known anywhere. Hesitantly, I let myself finally become aware of my surroundings, let the details sink in. I let my eyes focus on the features of the man standing there. Dimitri\u0027s brown eyes, gentle and firm, looked down on me. \"It\u0027s okay,\" he said. \"Everything\u0027s going to be okay. You can let go of the sword.\" My hands shook even harder as I fought to hold on to the hilt. \"I can\u0027t.\" The words hurt coming out. \"I can\u0027t leave him alone. I have to protect him.\" \"You have,\" said Dimitri. The sword fell out of my hands, landing with a loud clatter on the wooden floor. I followed, collapsing on all fours, wanting to cry but still unable to. Dimitri\u0027s arms wrapped around me as he helped me up. Voices swarmed around us, and one by one, I recognized people I knew and trusted. He started to tug me toward the door, but I refused to move just yet. I couldn\u0027t. My hands clutched his shirt, crumpling the fabric. Still keeping one arm around me, he smoothed my hair back away from my face. I leaned my head against him, and he continued stroking my hair, murmuring something in Russian. I didn\u0027t understand a word of it, but the gentle tone soothed me. Guardians were spreading throughout the house, examining it inch by inch. A couple of them approached us and knelt by the bodies I refused to look at. \"She did that? Both of them?\" \"That sword hasn\u0027t been sharpened in years!\" A funny sound caught in my throat. Dimitri squeezed my shoulder comfortingly. \"Get her out of here, Belikov,\" I heard a woman say behind him, her voice familiar. Dimitri squeezed my shoulder again. \"Come on, Roza. It\u0027s time to go.\" This time, I went. He guided me out of the house, holding onto me as I managed each agonizing step. My mind still refused to really process what had happened. I couldn\u0027t do much more than follow simple directions from those around me. I eventually ended up on one of the Academy\u0027s jets. Engines roared around us as the plane lifted off. Dimitri murmured something about coming back shortly and left me alone in my seat. I stared straight ahead, studying the details of the seat in front of me. Someone sat beside me and draped a blanket over my shoulders. I noticed then just how badly I was shivering. I tugged at the edges of the blanket. \"I\u0027m cold,\" I said. \"How am I so cold?\" \"You\u0027re in shock,\" Mia answered. I turned and looked at her, studying her blond curls and big blue eyes. Something about seeing her unleashed my memories. It all tumbled back. I squeezed my eyes shut. \"Oh God,\" I breathed. I opened my eyes and focused on her again. \"You saved me- saved me when you blew up the fish tank. You shouldn\u0027t have done it. You shouldn\u0027t have come back.\" She shrugged. \"You shouldn\u0027t have gone for the sword.\" Fair point. \"Thank you,\" I told her. \"What you did ... I never would have thought of that. It was brilliant.\" \"I don\u0027t know about that,\" she mused, smiling ruefully. \"Water isn\u0027t much of a weapon, remember?\" I choked on a laugh, even though I really didn\u0027t find my old words that funny. Not anymore. \"Water\u0027s a great weapon,\" I said finally. \"When we get back, we\u0027ll have to practice ways to use it.\" Her face lit up. Fierceness shone out from her eyes. \"I\u0027d like that. More than anything.\" \"I\u0027m sorry ... sorry about your mom.\" Mia simply nodded. \"You\u0027re lucky to still have yours. You don\u0027t know how lucky.\" I turned and stared at the seat again. The next words out of my mouth startled me: \"I wish she was here.\" \"She is,\" said Mia, sounding surprised. \"She was with the group that raided the house. Didn\u0027t you see her?\" I shook my head. We lapsed into silence. Mia stood up and left. A minute later, someone else sat down beside me. I didn\u0027t have to see her to know who she was. I just knew. \"Rose,\" said my mother. For once in my life, she sounded unsure of herself. Scared, maybe. \"Mia said you wanted to see me.\" I didn\u0027t answer. I didn\u0027t look at her. \"What...what do you need?\" I didn\u0027t know what I needed. I didn\u0027t know what to do. The stinging in my eyes grew unbearable, and before I knew it, I was crying. Big, painful sobs seized my body. The tears I\u0027d held back so long poured down my face. The fear and grief I\u0027d refused to let myself feel finally burst free, burning in my chest. I could scarcely breathe. My mother put her arms around me, and I buried my face in her chest, sobbing even harder. \"I know,\" she said softly, tightening her grip on me. \"I understand.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/frostbite-vampire-academy-2/page-23.html","bookId":2061,"book":{"id":2061,"title":"Frostbite (Vampire Academy #2)","description":"Storyline: Vampire Academy Series 2: Frostbite Rose loves Dimitri, Dimitri might love Tasha, and Mason would die to be with Rose...
