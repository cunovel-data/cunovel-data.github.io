It was the kind of kiss that small children shouldn\u0027t be allowed to see. Hell, it was the kind of kiss no one should be allowed to see- let alone experience through a psychic link.\n As I\u0027ve noted before, strong emotion from Lissa could make this phenomenon happen- the one where I got pulled inside her head. But always, always, it was because of some negative emotion. She\u0027d get upset or angry or depressed, and that would reach out to me. But this time? She wasn\u0027t upset.\n She was happy. Very, very happy.\n Oh man. I needed to get out of here.\n They were up in the attic of the school\u0027s chapel or, as I liked to call it, their love nest. The place had been a regular hangout for them, back when each of them was feeling antisocial and wanted to escape. Eventually, they\u0027d decided to be antisocial together, and one thing had led to another. Since they started publicly dating, I hadn\u0027t known they spent much time here anymore. Maybe they were back for old time\u0027s sake.\n And indeed, a celebration did seem to be going on. Little scented candles were set up around the dusty old place, candles that filled the air with the scent of lilacs. I would have been a little nervous about setting all those candles in a confined space filled with flammable boxes and books, but Christian probably figured he could control any accidental infernos.\n They finally broke that insanely long kiss and pulled back to look at each other. They lay on their sides on the floor. Several blankets had been spread under them.\n Christian\u0027s face was open and tender as he regarded Lissa, his pale blue eyes aglow with some inner emotion. It was different from the way Mason regarded me. There was certainly adoration with him, but Mason\u0027s was a lot like when you walk into a church and fall to your knees in awe and fear of something you worship but don\u0027t really understand. Christian clearly worshipped Lissa in his way, but there was a knowing glint to his eyes, a sense that the two of them shared an understanding of each other so perfect and powerful that they didn\u0027t even need words to convey it.\n \"Don\u0027t you think we\u0027re going to go to hell for this?\" asked Lissa.\n He reached out and touched her face, trailing his fingers along her cheek and neck and down to the top of her silky shirt. She breathed heavily at that touch, at the way it could be so gentle and small, yet evoke such a strong passion within her.\n \"For this?\" He played with the shirt\u0027s edge, letting his finger just barely brush inside of it.\n \"No,\" she laughed. \"For this.\" She gestured around the attic. \"This is a church. We shouldn\u0027t be doing this kind of, um, thing up here.\"\n \"Not true,\" he argued. Gently, he pushed her onto her back and leaned over her. \"The church is downstairs. This is just storage. God won\u0027t mind.\"\n \"You don\u0027t believe in God,\" she chastised. Her hands made their way down his chest. Her movements were as light and deliberate as his, yet they clearly triggered the same powerful response in him.\n He sighed happily as her hands slid under his shirt and up his stomach. \"I\u0027m humoring you.\"\n \"You\u0027d say anything right now,\" she accused. Her fingers caught the edge of his shirt and pushed it up. He shifted so she could push it all the way off him and then leaned back over her, bare-chested.\n \"You\u0027re right,\" he agreed. He carefully undid one button on her blouse. Just one. Then he again leaned down and gave her one of those hard, deep kisses. When he came up for air, he continued on as though nothing had happened. \"Tell me what you need to hear, and I\u0027ll say it.\" He unfastened another button.\n \"There\u0027s nothing I need to hear,\" she laughed. Another button popped free. \"You can tell me whatever you want- it\u0027d just be nice if it were true.\"\n \"The truth, huh? No one wants to hear the truth. The truth is never sexy. But you ...\" The last button came undone, and he spread her shirt away. \"You are too goddamned sexy to be real.\"\n His words held his trademark snarky tone, but his eyes conveyed a different message entirely. I was witnessing this scene through Lissa\u0027s eyes, but I could imagine what he saw. Her smooth, white skin. Slender waist and hips. A lacy white bra. Through her, I could feel that the lace was itchy, but she didn\u0027t care.\n Feelings both fond and hungry spread over his features. From within Lissa, I could feel her heart race and breathing quicken. Emotions similar to Christian\u0027s clouded all other coherent thoughts. Shifting down, he lay on top of her, pressing their bodies together. His mouth sought hers out again, and as their lips and tongues made contact, I knew I had to get out of there.\n Because I understood it now. I understood why Lissa had dressed up and why the love nest had been decked out like a Yankee Candles showroom. This was it. The moment. After a month of dating, they were going to have sex. Lissa, I knew, had done it before with a past boyfriend. I didn\u0027t know Christian\u0027s past, but I sincerely doubted many girls had fallen prey to his abrasive charm.\n But in feeling what Lissa felt, I could tell that none of that mattered. Not in that moment. In that moment, there were only the two of them and the way they felt about each other right now. And in a life filled with more worries than someone her age should have had, Lissa felt absolutely certain about what she was doing now. It was what she wanted. What she\u0027d wanted for a very long time with him.\n And I had no right to be witnessing it.\n Who was I kidding? I didn\u0027t want to witness it. I took no pleasure in watching other people get it on, and I sure as hell didn\u0027t want to experience sex with Christian. It\u0027d be like losing my virginity virtually.\n But Jesus Christ, Lissa wasn\u0027t making it easy to get out of her head. She had no desire to detach from her feelings and emotions, and the stronger they grew, the stronger they held me. Trying to distance myself from her, I focused my energies on coming back to myself, concentrating as hard as I could.\n More clothes disappeared ...\n Come on, come on, I told myself sternly.\n The condom came out... yikes.\n You\u0027re your own person, Rose. Get back in your head.\n Their limbs intertwined, their bodies moving together ...\n Son of a-\n I ripped out of her and back to myself. Once again, I was back in my room, but I no longer had any interest in packing my backpack. My whole world was askew. I felt strange and violated- almost unsure if I was Rose or if I was Lissa. I also felt that resentment toward Christian again. I certainly didn\u0027t want to have sex with Lissa, but there was that same pang inside of me, that frustrated feeling that I was no longer the center of her world.\n Leaving the backpack untouched, I went right to bed, wrapping my arms around myself and curling into a ball to try to squelch the ache within my chest.\n I fell asleep pretty quickly and woke up early as a result. Usually, I had to be dragged out of bed to go meet Dimitri, but today I showed up early enough that I actually beat him to the gym. As I waited, I saw Mason cutting across to one of the buildings that held classrooms.\n \"Whoa,\" I called. \"Since when are you up this early?\"\n \"Since I had to retake a math test,\" he said, walking over to me. He gave me his mischievous smile. \"Might be worth skipping, though, to hang out with you.\"\n I laughed, remembering my conversation with Lissa. Yes, there were definitely worse things I could do than flirt and start something with Mason.\n \"Nah. You might get in trouble, then I\u0027d have no real challenge on the slopes.\"\n He rolled his eyes, still smiling. \"I\u0027m the one with no real challenge, remember?\"\n \"You ready to bet on something yet? Or are you still too afraid?\"\n \"Watch it,\" he warned, \"or I might take back your Christmas present.\"\n \"You got me a present?\" I hadn\u0027t expected that.\n \"Yup. But if you keep back-talking, I might give it to someone else.\"\n \"Like Meredith?\" I teased.\n \"She isn\u0027t even in your league, and you know it.\"\n \"Even with a black eye?\" I asked with a grimace.\n \"Even with two black eyes.\"\n The look he gave me just then wasn\u0027t teasing or even really suggestive. It was just nice. Nice, friendly, and interested. Like he really cared. After all the stress lately, I decided I liked being cared about. And with the neglect I was starting to feel from Lissa, I realized I also kind of liked having someone who wanted to pay so much attention to me.\n \"What are you doing on Christmas?\" I asked.\n He shrugged. \"Nothing. My mom almost came down but had to cancel at the last minute ... you know, with everything that happened.\"\n Mason\u0027s mother wasn\u0027t a guardian. She was a dhampir who\u0027d chosen to just be domestic and have kids. As a result, I knew he saw her quite a bit. It was ironic, I thought, that my mom actually was here, but for all intents and purposes, she might as well have been somewhere else.\n \"Come hang with me,\" I said on impulse. \"I\u0027ll be with Lissa and Christian and his aunt. It\u0027ll be fun.\"\n \"Really?\"\n \"Very fun.\"\n \"That\u0027s not what I was asking about.\"\n I grinned. \"I know. Just be there, okay?\"\n He swept me one of the gallant bows he liked to make. \"Absolutely.\"\n Mason wandered off just as Dimitri showed up for our practice. Talking to Mason had made me feel giddy and happy; I hadn\u0027t thought about my face at all with him. But with Dimitri, I suddenly became self-conscious. I didn\u0027t want to be anything less than perfect with him, and as we walked inside, I went out of my way to avert my face so he couldn\u0027t look at me full-on. Worrying about that brought my mood down, and as it plummeted, all the other things that had been upsetting me came tumbling back.\n We returned to the training room with the dummies, and he told me he simply wanted me to practice the maneuvers from two days ago. Happy he wasn\u0027t going to bring up the fight, I set to my task with a burning zeal, showing the dummies just what would happen if they messed with Rose Hathaway. I knew my fighting fury was fired up by more than just a simple desire to do well. My feelings were out of control this morning, raw and intense after both the fight with my mother and what I\u0027d witnessed with Lissa and Christian last night. Dimitri sat back and watched me, occasionally critiquing my technique and offering suggestions for new tactics.\n \"Your hair\u0027s in the way,\" he said at one point. \"Not only are you blocking your peripheral vision, you\u0027re running the risk of letting your enemy get a handhold.\"\n \"If I\u0027m actually in a fight, I\u0027ll wear it up.\" I grunted as I shoved the stake neatly up between the dummy\u0027s \"ribs.\" I didn\u0027t know what these artificial bones were made of, but they were a bitch to work around. I thought about my mom again and added a little extra force to the jab. \"I\u0027m just wearing it down today, that\u0027s all.\"\n \"Rose,\" he said warningly. Ignoring him, I plunged again. His voice came more sharply the next time he spoke. \"Rose. Stop.\"\n I backed away from the dummy, surprised to find my breathing labored. I hadn\u0027t realized I was working that hard. My back hit the wall. With nowhere to go, I looked away from him, directing my eyes toward the ground.\n \"Look at me,\" he ordered.\n \"Dimitri- \"\n \"Look at me.\"\n No matter our close history, he was still my instructor. I couldn\u0027t refuse a direct order. Slowly, reluctantly, I turned toward him, still tilting my head slightly down so the hair hung over the sides of my face. Rising from his chair, he walked over and stood before me.\n I avoided his eyes but saw his hand move forward to brush back my hair. Then it stopped. As did my breathing. Our short-lived attraction had been filled with questions and reservations, but one thing I\u0027d known for sure: Dimitri had loved my hair. Maybe he still loved it. It was great hair, I\u0027ll admit. Long and silky and dark. He used to find excuses to touch it, and he\u0027d counseled me against cutting it as so many female guardians did.\n His hand hovered there, and the world stood still as I waited to see what he would do. After what seemed like an eternity, he let his hand gradually fall back to his side. Burning disappointment washed over me, yet at the same time, I\u0027d learned something. He\u0027d hesitated. He\u0027d been afraid to touch me, which maybe- just maybe- meant he still wanted to. He\u0027d had to hold himself back.\n I slowly tipped my head back so that we made eye contact. Most of my hair fell back from my face- but not all. His hand trembled again, and I hoped again he\u0027d reach forward. The hand steadied. My excitement dimmed.\n \"Does it hurt?\" he asked. The scent of that aftershave, mingled with his sweat, washed over me. God, I wished he had touched me.\n \"No,\" I lied.\n \"It doesn\u0027t look so bad,\" he told me. \"It\u0027ll heal.\"\n \"I hate her,\" I said, astonished at just how much venom those three words held. Even while suddenly turned on and wanting Dimitri, I still couldn\u0027t drop the grudge I held against my mother.\n \"No, you don\u0027t,\" he said gently.\n \"I do.\"\n \"You don\u0027t have time to hate anyone,\" he advised, his voice still kind. \"Not in our profession. You should make peace with her.\"\n Lissa had said exactly the same thing. Outrage joined my other emotions. That darkness within me started to unfurl. \"Make peace with her? After she gave me a black eye on purpose! Why am I the only one who sees how crazy that is?\"\n \"She absolutely did not do it on purpose,\" he said, voice hard. \"No matter how much you resent her, you have to believe that. She wouldn\u0027t do that, and anyway, I saw her later that day. She was worried about you.\"\n \"Probably more worried someone will bring her up on child abuse charges,\" I grumbled.\n \"Don\u0027t you think this is the time of year for forgiveness?\"\n I sighed loudly. \"This isn\u0027t a Christmas special! This is my life. In the real world, miracles and goodness just don\u0027t happen.\"\n He was still eyeing my calmly. \"In the real world, you can make your own miracles.\"\n My frustration suddenly hit a breaking point, and I gave up trying to maintain my control. I was so tired of being told reasonable, practical things whenever something went wrong in my life. Somewhere in me, I knew Dimitri only wanted to help, but I just wasn\u0027t up for the well-meant words. I wanted comfort for my problems. I didn\u0027t want to think about what would make me a better person. I wished he\u0027d just hold me and tell me not to worry.\n \"Okay, can you just stop this for once?\" I demanded, hands on my hips.\n \"Stop what?\"\n \"The whole profound Zen crap thing. You don\u0027t talk to me like a real person. Everything you say is just some wise, life-lesson nonsense. You really do sound like a Christmas special.\" I knew it wasn\u0027t entirely fair to take my anger out on him, but I found myself practically shouting. \"I swear, sometimes it\u0027s just like you want to hear yourself talk! And I know you\u0027re not always this way. You were perfectly normal when you talked to Tasha. But with me? You\u0027re just going through the motions. You don\u0027t care about me. You\u0027re just stuck in your stupid mentor role.\"\n He stared at me, uncharacteristically surprised. \"I don\u0027t care about you?\"\n \"No.\" I was being petty- very, very petty. And I knew the truth- that he did care and was more than just a mentor. I couldn\u0027t help myself, though. It just kept coming and coming. I jabbed his chest with my finger. \"I\u0027m another student to you. You just go on and on with your stupid life lessons so that- \"\n The hand I\u0027d hoped would touch my hair suddenly reached out and grabbed my pointing hand. He pinned it to the wall, and I was surprised to see a flare of emotion in his eyes. It wasn\u0027t exactly anger...but it was frustration of another kind.\n \"Don\u0027t tell me what I\u0027m feeling,\" he growled.\n I saw then that half of what I\u0027d said was true. He was almost always calm, always in control- even when fighting. But he\u0027d also told me how he\u0027d once snapped and beaten up his Moroi father. He\u0027d actually been like me once- always on the verge of acting without thinking, doing things he knew he shouldn\u0027t.\n \"That\u0027s it, isn\u0027t it?\" I asked.\n \"What?\"\n \"You\u0027re always fighting for control. You\u0027re the same as me.\"\n \"No,\" he said, still obviously worked up. \"I\u0027ve learned my control.\"\n Something about this new realization emboldened me. \"No,\" I informed him. \"You haven\u0027t. You put on a good face, and most of the time you do stay in control. But sometimes you can\u0027t. And sometimes ...\" I leaned forward, lowering my voice. \"Sometimes you don\u0027t want to.\"\n \"Rose...\"\n I could see his labored breathing and knew his heart was beating as quickly as mine. And he wasn\u0027t pulling away. I knew this was wrong- knew all the logical reasons for us staying apart. But right then, I didn\u0027t care. I didn\u0027t want to control myself. I didn\u0027t want to be good.\n Before he realized what was happening, I kissed him. Our lips met, and when I felt him kiss me back, I knew I was right. He pressed himself closer, trapping me between him and the wall. He kept holding my hand, but his other one snaked behind my head, sliding into my hair. The kiss was filled with so much intensity; it held anger, passion, release....\n He was the one who broke it. He jerked away from me and took several steps back, looking shaken.\n \"Do not do that again,\" he said stiffly.\n \"Don\u0027t kiss me back then,\" I retorted.\n He stared at me for what seemed like forever. \"I don\u0027t give \u0027Zen lessons\u0027 to hear myself talk. I don\u0027t give them because you\u0027re another student. I\u0027m doing this to teach you control.\"\n \"You\u0027re doing a great job,\" I said bitterly.\n He closed his eyes for half a second, exhaled, and muttered something in Russian. Without another glance at me, he turned and left the room. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/frostbite-vampire-academy-2/page-9.html","bookId":2061,"book":{"id":2061,"title":"Frostbite (Vampire Academy #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Vampire Academy Series 2: Frostbite \n Rose loves Dimitri, Dimitri might love Tasha, and Mason would die to be with Rose... \n It\u0027s winter break at St. Vladimir\u0027s, but Rose is feeling anything but festive.
