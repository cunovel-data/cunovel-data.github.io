Rhetorically, since she was already up the Snow-White-and-the-Seven-Dwarves-Do-Baby-Jesus neighbor\u0027s tree and staring into the yard of the house where she\u0027d left Sibby.\\n\\n I can\u0027t wait to hear you say to the cops, \"Yes, officer, I know I was trespassing but that woman was very suspicious because she was wearing false eyelashes.\"\\n\\n With a full Creepy Cult costume. They just didn\u0027t go. Plus she had a hole for a nose piercing. And a French manicure.\\n\\n Maybe she just has really big pores! And a love of dated manicures!\\n\\n She wasn\u0027t what she was posing as.\\n\\n Is this about helping someone or having an excuse not to show up at prom and see Will with his face nuzzled in Ariel\u0027s huge, soft-\\n\\n Shut up, U-Suck.\\n\\n I was going to say hair.\\n\\n You are so not funny.\\n\\n You are so not brave.\\n\\n There were two guys sitting in the backyard, leaning across a picnic table toward each other with a book between them, both in T-shirts and khakis and Teva sandals, one of them wearing thick black-framed glasses, the other one with a scraggly beard. They looked like two geeky college guys playing Dungeons and Dragons and sounded like it too when the one wearing glasses said, \"That\u0027s not how it works. It says in the Book of Rules she can\u0027t see for herself, only for other people. You know, like genies with wishes, how they can\u0027t grant their own.\" Except they each had a large automatic rifle lying on the table next to them and Miranda could see shooting targets set up on the fence.\\n\\n So what? There are armed geeks. Maybe they\u0027re Sibby\u0027s protection. Go home. Sibby doesn\u0027t need you. She\u0027s fine.\\n\\n If she\u0027s fine, why isn\u0027t she out there trying to kiss the two boys?\\n\\n Miranda strained to hear something from inside the house but it was definitely soundproofed. A couple came out of sliding doors onto the patio away from the Geek Guys, a woman smoking a cigarette in short, tense puffs and a man. Miranda almost fell out of the tree when she recognized the woman as the cult lady, only now without the glasses, skirt, or sweater and with her hair down.\\n\\n Which doesn\u0027t mean anything.\\n\\n The woman whispered, \"We still need the girl to tell us the location, Byron.\"\\n\\n \"She will.\"\\n\\n \"She hasn\u0027t yet.\"\\n\\n \"I told you, even if I can\u0027t get her to talk, the Gardener can. He\u0027s good at that.\"\\n\\n The woman again: \"I don\u0027t like that he brought a partner. That wasn\u0027t part of the plan. Does she get a cut-\"\\n\\n The man called Byron cut her off. \"Put that out and be quiet, we have company.\" He pointed to the Geek Guys scrambling over to join them.\\n\\n The woman crushed her cigarette out under her foot and kicked it away.\\n\\n \"Is She all right?\" Bearded Geek asked breathlessly, pronouncing She like it should be capitalized.\\n\\n \"Yes,\" the man assured him. \"She\u0027s resting after her ordeal.\"\\n\\n Oh, they could not be talking about Sibby. Ordeal? No way.\\n\\n \"Has She said anything?\" Glasses Geek asked.\\n\\n The man said, \"Just expressed how very grateful She is to be here.\"\\n\\n Miranda almost snorted.\\n\\n Bearded Geek said, \"Will we be able to see Her?\"\\n\\n \"When the Transition happens.\"\\n\\n The geeks wandered off in a blissful daze and Miranda decided this was the weirdest thing she\u0027d ever seen.\\n\\n But it proved that Sibby was in no danger. These people clearly worshipped Her. Which meant it was time-\\n\\n \"Why is he called the Gardener, anyway?\" Fake Eyelash woman asked the man.\\n\\n \"I believe because he\u0027s good at pulling things out.\"\\n\\n \"Things?\"\\n\\n \"Teeth, nails. Joints. That\u0027s how he gets people to talk.\"\\n\\n - time to find Sibby.\\n\\n Miranda dropped out of the tree into the neighbor\u0027s yard and found herself looking down the barrel of an automatic rifle. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/prom-nights-from-hell/page-21.html","bookId":2030,"book":{"id":2030,"title":"Prom Nights from Hell","description":"Storyline: In this exciting collection of paranormal tales, best-selling authors Stephenie Meyer (Twilight), Kim Harrison (Once Dead, Twice Shy), Meg Cabot (How to Be Popular), Lauren Myracle (ttyl), and Michele Jaffe (Bad Kitty) take prom mishaps to a whole new level—a truly hellish level.
