Even though she\u0027s not exactly my type, it\u0027s not pleasant to think of Lila as some vampire\u0027s midnight snack.\n \"Aren\u0027t you worried,\" I ask, hoping to change the subject a little, \"that Lila\u0027s just going to tell Drake not to show up at the prom since we\u0027ll be there waiting?\"\n I say we and not you because there is no way I\u0027m letting Mary go after this guy alone. Which I know Veronica would think is sexist, too.\n But Veronica\u0027s never seen Mary smile.\n \"Are you kidding me?\" Mary asks. She doesn\u0027t seem to notice the we. \"I\u0027m counting on her telling him. That way he\u0027ll show up for sure.\"\n I stare at her. \"Why would he do that?\"\n \"Because killing the exterminator\u0027s daughter will totally raise his crypt cred.\"\n Now I\u0027m blinking at her. \"Crypt cred?\"\n \"You know,\" she says, tossing her ponytail. \"It\u0027s like street cred. Only among the undead.\"\n \"Oh.\" Strangely, this does make sense. As much as anything else I\u0027ve heard this evening. \"They call your dad the, um, \u0027exterminator\u0027?\" I\u0027m having a hard time picturing Mary\u0027s dad wielding a crossbow the way she did.\n \"No,\" she says, the smile vanishing. \"My mom. At least... she used to be. Not just vampires, either, but evil entities of all kinds-demons, werewolves, poltergeists, ghosts, warlocks, genies, satyrs, loki, shedus, vetelas, titans, leprechauns-\"\n \"Leprechauns?\" I echo in disbelief.\n But Mary simply shrugs. \"If it was evil, Mom killed it. She just had a gift for it... A gift,\" Mary adds softly, \"I really hope I\u0027ve inherited.\"\n I just sit there for a minute. I have to admit I\u0027m a little stunned by everything that\u0027s gone down over the past couple of hours. Crossbows and vampires and exterminators? And what in the world is a vetela? I\u0027m not even sure I want to know. No. Wait. I know I don\u0027t want to know. There\u0027s a humming noise inside my head that won\u0027t stop.\n The weird thing is, I kind of like it.\n \"So,\" Mary says, lifting her gaze to meet mine. \"Do you believe me now?\"\n \"I believe you,\" I say. What I can\u0027t believe, actually, is that I do. Believe her, I mean.\n \"Good,\" she says. \"It would probably be better if you didn\u0027t tell anybody. Now, if you don\u0027t mind, I need to start getting things ready-\"\n \"Great. Tell me what you need me to do.\"\n Her face clouds with trouble. \"Adam,\" she says. And there\u0027s something about the way her lips form my name that makes me feel a little crazy... like I want to throw my arms around her and race around the room at the same time. \"I appreciate the offer. I really do. But it\u0027s too dangerous. If I kill Drake-\"\n \"When you kill him,\" I correct her.\n \" - chances are, his father is going to show up,\" she goes on, \"looking for revenge. Maybe not tonight. And maybe not tomorrow. But soon. And when he does... it isn\u0027t going to be pretty. It\u0027s going to be awful. A nightmare. It\u0027s going to be-\"\n \"Apocalyptic,\" I finish for her, a slight shiver going down my spine as I speak the word.\n \"Yes. Yes, exactly.\"\n \"Don\u0027t worry,\" I say, ignoring the shiver. \"I\u0027m all set for that.\"\n \"Adam.\" She shakes her head. \"You don\u0027t understand. I can\u0027t-well, I can\u0027t guarantee I\u0027ll be able to protect you. And I certainly can\u0027t let you risk your life like that. It\u0027s different for me, because-well, because of my mom. But you-\"\n I stop her. \"Just tell me what time I\u0027m picking you up.\"\n She stares at me. \"What?\"\n \"Sorry,\" I say. \"But you\u0027re not going to the prom by yourself. End of story.\"\n And I must have looked really scary or something as I said it, because even though she opens her mouth to argue, she closes it again when she gets a look at my face, and only says, \"Um. Okay.\"\n Still, she has to add, \"It\u0027s your funeral,\" just to have the last word.\n Which is fine with me. She can have the last word.\n Because I know now that I\u0027ve found her: my future partner in the inevitable struggle to survive in post-apocalyptic America.\n Mary\n The music is pounding in time to my heartbeat. I can feel the bass in my chest-badoom, badoom. It\u0027s hard to see across the room of writhing bodies, especially with the flickering light show coming down from the ballroom\u0027s ceiling.\n But I know he\u0027s here. I can feel him.\n And then I see him, moving across the dance floor toward me. He\u0027s holding two glasses of bloodred liquid, one in either hand. When he gets close enough, he hands me one of the glasses, then says, \"Don\u0027t worry, it\u0027s not spiked. I checked.\"\n I don\u0027t reply. I just sip the punch, grateful for the liquid-even if it is a little too sweet-because my throat is so dry.\n The thing is, I know I\u0027m making a mistake. Letting Adam do this, I mean.\n But... there\u0027s something about him. I don\u0027t know what it is. Something that sets him apart from all the rest of the dumb jocks in school. Maybe it\u0027s the way he saved me back at the club when I lost my nerve, his shooting at Sebastian Drake-progeny of the devil himself-with a ketchup-filled squirt gun.\n Or maybe it\u0027s the way he was so nice about my dad, not cracking any jokes about him being like Doc from the Back to the Future movies and even calling him sir. Or the way he picked up my mom\u0027s photo like that and seemed so stunned when I told him the truth about her.\n Or maybe it\u0027s just the way he looked when he showed up at quarter to eight this evening, so impossibly handsome in his tux-and even holding a red rose corsage for me... despite that less than twenty-four hours ago, he hadn\u0027t even known he was going to the prom (good thing tickets were available for sale at the door).\n Oh well. Dad was ecstatic, for once acting like a normal parent, snapping photos-\"For your mother to see, when she\u0027s better,\" he kept saying-and trying to slip twenty-dollar bills into Adam\u0027s hand, telling him to \"treat Mary to an ice cream after the dance.\"\n Which frankly made me decide I like Dad better when he never comes out of the lab.\n Still. I knew I was making a mistake by not sending Adam packing right away. This is no job for amateurs.\n This is... this is...\n ... beautiful. I mean, that\u0027s how the ballroom looks. I almost gasped when I entered it on Adam\u0027s arm. (He insisted. So we\u0027d look like a \"normal couple\" if Drake was there already and watching.) The Saint Eligius Prep prom committee really outdid themselves this year.\n Securing the four-story grand ballroom at the Waldorf-Astoria was a feat all on its own, but transforming it into such a sparkling romantic wonderland? Miraculous.\n I just hope all those rosettes and streamers are fireproof. I\u0027d hate to see them go up in the flames that are bound to appear when Drake\u0027s corpse begins to self-conflagrate after I stab him in the chest.\n \"So,\" Adam says, as we stand on the edge of the dance floor, sipping our punch in a silence that\u0027s-to be frank-quickly gotten a little uncomfortable. \"How\u0027s this going to go down, anyway? I don\u0027t see your crossbow anywhere.\"\n \"I\u0027m just going with a stake,\" I say, showing him my leg through the slit up the side of my gown. I\u0027d strapped a hand-carved piece of ash there, using Mom\u0027s old thigh holster. \"Keeping it sweet and simple.\"\n \"Oh,\" Adam says, after choking on his punch a little. \"Okay.\"\n I realize he hasn\u0027t looked away from my inner thigh. I hastily lower my skirt.\n And it occurs to me-for the first time-that Adam might be in this for reasons other than wanting to liberate his best friend\u0027s girlfriend from the spell of a bloodsucking fiend.\n Except... can such a thing even be possible? I mean, he\u0027s Adam Blum. And I\u0027m just the new girl. He likes me, sure, but he doesn\u0027t like me. He can\u0027t. I\u0027ve probably only got about ten minutes left to live. Unless something radically alters what I\u0027m pretty sure is about to go down.\n Blushing, I keep my gaze on the gyrating couples in front of us. Mrs. Gregory from U.S. History is one of the chaperones. She\u0027s going around, trying to keep girls from grinding on their dates. She might as well try to keep the moon from rising.\n \"It\u0027d probably be best if you kept Lila busy,\" I say, hoping he doesn\u0027t notice that my cheeks are now as scarlet as my gown, \"while I\u0027m doing the staking. We don\u0027t want her throwing herself in my path just to try to save him.\"\n \"That\u0027s what I dragged Ted here for,\" Adam says, nodding toward Teddy Hancock, who\u0027s sitting slumped at a nearby table, looking out at the dance floor in a bored manner. Like the rest of us, he\u0027s just waiting for Lila-and her date-to arrive.\n \"Still,\" I say. \"I don\u0027t want you anywhere near me when... you know.\"\n \"I heard you the first nine million times you told me,\" Adam mutters. \"I know you can take care of yourself, Mary. You\u0027ve made that abundantly clear.\"\n I can\u0027t help wincing a little. He\u0027s not having a good time. I can tell.\n Well, so what? I didn\u0027t ask him to come! He invited himself! This isn\u0027t a date, anyway! It\u0027s a slaying! He knew that from the outset. He\u0027s the one changing the rules, not me. I mean, who am I kidding? I can\u0027t date. I have a legacy to fulfill. I\u0027m the exterminator\u0027s daughter. I have to-\n \"Want to dance?\" Adam startles me by asking.\n \"Oh,\" I say, with some surprise. \"I\u0027d love to. But I really should-\"\n \"Great,\" he says and takes me into his arms, steering me onto the dance floor. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/prom-nights-from-hell/page-5.html","bookId":2030,"book":{"id":2030,"title":"Prom Nights from Hell","description":"Storyline: \n In this exciting collection of paranormal tales, best-selling authors Stephenie Meyer (Twilight), Kim Harrison (Once Dead, Twice Shy), Meg Cabot (How to Be Popular), Lauren Myracle (ttyl), and Michele Jaffe (Bad Kitty) take prom mishaps to a whole new level—a truly hellish level.
