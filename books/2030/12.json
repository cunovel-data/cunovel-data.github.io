{"id":108591,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"Yun Sun\u0027s voice grew sharp. \"Frankie, no!\"\n \"I\u0027m such an idiot-why didn\u0027t I think of it before?\"\n \"Wait. Don\u0027t do it, don\u0027t make the-\" She broke off. I heard a \"whoops,\" followed by drunken apologies and someone saying, \"Oh, I love your dress!\" It sounded like everyone was having fun. I\u0027d soon be having fun with them.\n I made it to the den and approached the bookshelf where I\u0027d left the corsage. I patted the tops of the books and then the space behind them. My fingers found softness, like petals of skin.\n \"I\u0027m back,\" Yun Sun said. The background sounds had diminished, suggesting she\u0027d stepped outside. \"And, Frankie, I know you\u0027re hurting. I know that. But what happened to Will was just a coincidence. A terrible, terrible coincidence.\"\n \"Call it what you want,\" I said. \"I\u0027m making my second wish.\" I plucked the corsage from behind the books.\n Yun Sun\u0027s anxiety intensified. \"Frankie, no, you can\u0027t!\"\n \"Why not?\"\n \"He fell from three hundred feet! His body was... they said he was mangled beyond... that\u0027s why they had a closed casket, remember?\"\n \"So?\"\n \"He\u0027s been rotting in a coffin for thirteen days!\" she cried.\n \"Yun Sun, that is a tasteless thing to say. Honestly, if it were Jeremy being brought back to life, would we even be having this conversation?\" I drew the flowers to my face, lightly touching the petals with my lips. \"Listen, I\u0027ve got to go. But save some punch for me! And Will! Ooo, make that lots of punch for Will-I bet he\u0027ll be absolutely crazed with thirst!\"\n I flipped my phone shut. I held the corsage aloft.\n \"I wish for Will to be alive again!\" I cried exultantly.\n The stench of decay thickened the air. The corsage curled, as if the petals were shrinking in on themselves. I flung it away on autopilot, just as I\u0027d shake off an earwig that chanced to light on my hand. But whatever. The corsage wasn\u0027t important. What was important was Will. Where was he?\n I glanced around, ridiculously expecting him to be sitting on the sofa, looking at me like You\u0027re scared of a bunch of dried flowers? Pitiful!\n The sofa was empty, a gloomy, looming shape by the wall.\n I darted to the window and peered out. Nothing. Just the wind, fluttering the leaves on the trees.\n \"Will?\" I said.\n Again nothing. A tremendous well of disappointment opened inside me, and I sank into my father\u0027s leather armchair.\n Stupid Frankie. Stupid, foolish, pathetic me.\n Time passed. Cicadas chirped.\n Stupid cicadas.\n And then, so faint, a thud. And then another. I straightened my spine.\n Gravel popped on the road... or maybe the driveway? The thuds came closer. They were labored and with the odd offbeat of a limp, or of something being dragged.\n I strained to hear.\n There-a thump, ten feet away on the porch. A thump that was distinctly inhuman.\n My throat closed as Yun Sun\u0027s words wormed back to me. Mangled, she\u0027d said. Rotting. I wasn\u0027t paying attention before. Now it was too late. What had I done?\n I jumped out of the chair and fled to the entry hall, safe from the eyes of anyone-or anything-who might choose to peer through the den\u0027s wide windows. What, exactly, had I brought back to life?\n A knock echoed through the house. I whimpered, then clapped my hand over my mouth.\n \"Frankie?\" a voice called. \"I\u0027m, uh... yikes. I\u0027m kind of a mess.\" He laughed his self-deprecating laugh. \"But I\u0027m here. That\u0027s the important thing. I\u0027m here to take you to prom!\"\n \"We don\u0027t have to go to prom,\" I said. Was that me sounding so shrill? \"Who needs prom? I mean, seriously!\"\n \"Yeah, sure, this from the girl who would kill for the perfect romantic evening.\" The knob rattled. \"Aren\u0027t you going to let me in?\"\n I hyperventilated.\n There was a series of plops, like overripe strawberries being dropped into the trash, and then, \"Aw, dude. Not good.\"\n \"Will?\" I whispered.\n \"This is so uncool... but do you have any stain remover?\"\n Holy crap. Holy, holy, holy crap.\n \"You\u0027re not mad, are you?\" Will asked. He sounded worried. \"I came as fast as I could. But it was so frickin\u0027 weird, Frankie. Because, like...\"\n My mind flew to airless caskets, deep in the ground. Please, no, I thought.\n \"Forget it. It was weird-let\u0027s leave it at that.\" He tried to lighten things up. \"Now are you going to let me in, or what? I\u0027m falling to pieces out here!\"\n I pressed my body against the hall wall. My knees buckled, I wasn\u0027t doing too well with muscle control, but I reminded myself that I was safe behind the solid front door. Whatever else he was, Will was still flesh and bones. Well, partially. But not yet a ghost who could move through walls.\n \"Will, you\u0027ve got to go,\" I said. \"I made a mistake, okay?\"\n \"A mistake? What do you mean?\" His confusion broke my heart.\n \"It\u0027s just... oh God.\" I started crying. \"We\u0027re not right for each other anymore. You understand, don\u0027t you?\"\n \"No, I don\u0027t. You wanted me to ask you to prom, so I asked you to prom. And now for no good reason... ohhh! I get it!\"\n \"You do?\"\n \"You don\u0027t want me to see you! That\u0027s it, isn\u0027t it? You\u0027re nervous about how you look!\"\n \"Um...\" Should I run with this? Should I say yes just so he would leave?\n \"Frankie. Dude. You have nothing to worry about.\" He laughed. \"One, you\u0027re beautiful; and two, compared to me, there\u0027s no way you won\u0027t look like... I don\u0027t know, an angel from heaven.\"\n He sounded relieved, as if he\u0027d had a niggling sense of something being off, but couldn\u0027t quite place his finger on it. But now he knew: It was Frankie having self-esteem issues, that\u0027s all! Silly Frankie!\n I heard a shuffling, and then the bump of a small wooden lid. My body tensed, because I knew that bump.\n The milk box-crap. He\u0027d remembered the key in the milk box.\n \"I\u0027m letting myself in,\" he called, slump-thumping back to the front door.\" \u0027Kay, Franks? \u0027Cause all of a sudden I\u0027m, like, dying to see you!\"\n He laughed, jubilant. \"I mean, wait, that came out wrong... but, heck, guess that\u0027s the theme of the night. Everything\u0027s coming out wrong-and I do mean everything!\"\n I fled to the den, where I got on my hands and knees and frantically patted the floor. If only it weren\u0027t so dark!\n The deadbolt stuck, and Will jangled the key. His breathing was clotted.\n \"I\u0027m coming, Frankie!\" he called. Jangle, jangle. \"I\u0027m coming as fast as I can!\"\n My fear ratcheted so high that I was thrown into an altered state of reality. I was gasping and crying out, I could hear myself, and my hands were blind feelers, pawing and slapping as I crawled.\n With a thunk, the bolt slid home.\n \"Yes,\" Will crowed.\n The door swished over the frayed carpet at the exact instant my fingers closed on the crumbling corsage.\n \"Frankie? Why is it so dark? And why aren\u0027t you-\"\n I squeezed my eyes shut and spoke my final wish.\n All sounds ceased, save for the rustle of wind in the leaves. The door, continuing its slow trajectory, bumped against the doorjamb. I stayed where I was on the floor. I sobbed, because my heart was breaking. No, my heart was broken.\n After several moments, the cicadas once again took up their yearning chorus. I rose to my feet, stumbled across the room, and stood, shivering, in the open doorway. Outside, a pale shaft of moonlight shone on the deserted road.\n \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/prom-nights-from-hell/page-12.html","bookId":2030,"book":{"id":2030,"title":"Prom Nights from Hell","description":"Storyline: \n In this exciting collection of paranormal tales, best-selling authors Stephenie Meyer (Twilight), Kim Harrison (Once Dead, Twice Shy), Meg Cabot (How to Be Popular), Lauren Myracle (ttyl), and Michele Jaffe (Bad Kitty) take prom mishaps to a whole new level—a truly hellish level.
