{"id":108612,"no":33,"title":"Page 33","content":"\"Poor Sheeb, still locked in half-human form,\" Jezebel teased. \"I remember how good everything smells all the time. Ugh. And the temperature! Do the humans have to freeze everything with their wretched air-conditioning?\"\\n\\n Sheba\u0027s face was smooth now, controlled. \"I get by. There\u0027s plenty of misery to go around.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s the spirit! Just another few centuries, and you\u0027ll be in the big-time with me.\"\\n\\n Sheba allowed a smirk to curl her lips. \"Or maybe not quite so long.\"\\n\\n One black eyebrow arched high against Jezebel\u0027s white forehead, raising almost to an ebony horn.\\n\\n \"Is that so? Got something particularly evil up your sleeve, little sister?\"\\n\\n Sheba didn\u0027t answer, tensing again as Jezebel sent her own thoughts snaking invisibly through the crowd inside the ballroom. Sheba locked her jaw, ready to strike back if Jezebel tried to undo any of her schemes. But Jezebel just looked, touching nothing.\\n\\n \"Hmm,\" Jezebel hummed to herself. \"Hmm.\"\\n\\n Sheba\u0027s fists clenched hard as Jezebel\u0027s search touched Cooper Silverdale, but again, Jezebel merely observed.\\n\\n \"Well, well,\" the horned demoness murmured. \"Wow. Sheeb, I\u0027ve got to say it, I\u0027m impressed. You got a gun in. And a motivated hand-full of alcohol to weaken his free will!\" The older demoness smiled with something that looked strangely like sincerity. \"This is really evil. I mean, sure, a middle demon working homicide or mayhem or maybe riots could set something like this up at a prom, but a human-form child on misery detail? What are you, two, three hundred?\"\\n\\n \"Just one-eighty-six at my last spawn day,\" Sheba answered brusquely, still wary.\\n\\n Jezebel whistled a tongue of flame through her lips. \"Very impressed. And I can see that you aren\u0027t neglecting your assignment, either. That\u0027s one miserable crowd in there.\" Jezebel laughed. \"You\u0027ve ended nearly every promising relationship, broken a few dozen lifelong friendships, made new enemies... three, four, five fights brewing,\" Jezebel counted, her mind with the humans. \"You\u0027ve even got the DJ listening to you! Such attention to detail. Ha-ha! I can count on one hand the humans who aren\u0027t completely wretched.\"\\n\\n Sheba smiled grimly. \"I\u0027ll get to them.\"\\n\\n \"Ghastly, Sheeb. Seriously nasty. You do our name proud. If every prom had a demoness like you involved, we\u0027d own this world.\"\\n\\n \"Aw, Jez, you\u0027re making me blush,\" Sheba said with heavy sarcasm.\\n\\n Jezebel laughed. \"Of course, you\u0027ve got a little help.\"\\n\\n Jezebel\u0027s thoughts twisted in a circle around Celeste, who had just twisted herself around a new boy. Jilted girls cried, while the boys Celeste carelessly tossed aside flexed their fists and glowered wrathfully at their competition; burning with lust, each was determined that Celeste was finishing the night with him.\\n\\n Celeste was doing half the work tonight.\\n\\n \"I use the tools available to me,\" Sheba said.\\n\\n \"What an ironic name! What an evil mind! Is she fully human?\"\\n\\n \"I passed her in the hall, just to check,\" Sheba admitted. \"Pure, clean human scent. Revolting.\"\\n\\n \"Huh. I would have sworn she had some demon in her ancestry. Good find. But, Sheba, asking a date? Pretty amateur, involving yourself physically that way.\"\\n\\n Sheba\u0027s chin jabbed upward defensively, but she did not answer. Jezebel was right; it was crude and time-consuming to use one\u0027s human form rather than one\u0027s demon mind. However, it was the results that counted. Sheba\u0027s timely interference had kept Logan from discovering his true love.\\n\\n \"Well, it in no way diminishes your accomplishments here tonight.\" Jezebel\u0027s tone was conciliatory. \"You pull this one off, and they\u0027ll put you in the baby demons\u0027 textbooks.\"\\n\\n \"Thanks,\" Sheba snapped. Did Jezebel really think she could flatter Sheba into letting her guard down?\\n\\n Jezebel smiled, and her mists curled up on the edges, mirroring the expression.\\n\\n \"A tip, Sheba. Keep them confused in there. If you can get Cooper to pull the trigger, then you might make some of these wannabe gangsters think they\u0027re under fire.\" Jezebel shook her head in wonder. \"You\u0027ve got so much potential mayhem here. Of course, they\u0027ll bring in a riot demon if it really gets hot... but you\u0027d still get some of the credit for stirring it up.\"\\n\\n Sheba grimaced, and glimmers of red flashed at her ears. What was Jezebel doing? Where was the trick? Her mind ran over and over the humans she was assigned to torment, but she could find no trace of Jezebel\u0027s distinct brimstone flavor in the ballroom. There was nothing but the misery Sheba had caused herself, and the few little pockets of repellent happiness that Sheba would attend to shortly.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re certainly helpful tonight,\" Sheba said, being deliberately insulting.\\n\\n Jezebel sighed, and there was something about the way her mists rolled back in on themselves that made her look... embarrassed. For the first time, Sheba felt a hint of doubt about her assumptions. But Jezebel\u0027s motives had to be malicious. That\u0027s the only kind of motives demons had.\\n\\n With a rueful expression on her face, Jezebel asked quietly, \"Is it so impossible to believe that I might want you to get promoted?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n Jezebel sighed again. And again, the way her mists writhed in chagrin made Sheba uncertain.\\n\\n \"Why?\" Sheba demanded. \"What do you get out of this?\"\\n\\n \"I know it\u0027s all wrong-or rather right-for me to be giving you advice you can work with. Not very evil of me.\"\\n\\n Sheba nodded cautiously.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s in our nature to trip up everyone, demons, humans-even angels if we get the chance. We\u0027re evil. Naturally we\u0027re going to backstab, whether it hurts our side or not. We wouldn\u0027t be demons if we didn\u0027t let envy, greed, lust, and wrath rule us.\" Jezebel chuckled. \"I remember-how many years ago was it? - Lilith almost got you booted back a few grades, didn\u0027t she?\"\\n\\n Red fire smoldered in Sheba\u0027s eyes at the memory. \"Almost.\"\\n\\n \"You handled it better than most. You\u0027re one of the very worst working misery right now, you know.\"\\n\\n Flattery again? Sheba stiffened.\\n\\n Jezebel twisted her mists up with a finger, and then circled that finger so that the mists drew a smoky orb against the night sky.\\n\\n \"There\u0027s a bigger picture, though, Sheba. Demons like Lilith can\u0027t see past the evil at hand. But there\u0027s a whole world out there, full of humans making millions of decisions every minute of the day and night. We can only be there to sway a fraction of those decisions. And sometimes, well, from where I\u0027m standing, it feels like the angels are getting ahead...\"\\n\\n \"But, Jezebel!\" Sheba gasped, shock breaking through her suspicion. \"We\u0027re winning. Just watch the news-it\u0027s obvious we\u0027re winning.\"\\n\\n \"I know, I know. But even with all the wars and destruction... it\u0027s odd, Sheba. There\u0027s still an awful lot of happiness out there. For every mugging I turn into a homicide, across town some angel has a bystander jumping another mugger to save the day. Or convincing the mugger to give up his wicked ways! Ugh. We\u0027re losing ground.\"\\n\\n \"But the angels are weak, Jezebel. Everyone knows that. They\u0027re so full of love that they can\u0027t concentrate. Half the time the stupid birdbrains fall in love with a human and trade their wings for a human body. Though why even an idiot angel would want this!\" Sheba scowled down the length of her human form. So limiting. \"I\u0027ve never really understood the point of having to wear these around for half a millennium. I guess it\u0027s probably just to torture us, isn\u0027t it? The dark lords must enjoy watching us squirm.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s more than that. It\u0027s to make you really hate them. The humans, I mean.\"\\n\\n Sheba stared at her. \"Why would I need a reason? Hate is what I do.\"\\n\\n \"It happens, you know,\" Jezebel said slowly. \"The angels aren\u0027t the only ones to give it all up. There are demons who\u0027ve traded their horns for a human.\"\\n\\n \"No!\" Sheba\u0027s eyes widened, then narrowed in disbelief. \"You\u0027re exaggerating. Now and then a demon shacks up with a human, but it\u0027s just to torment them. Just a bit of malicious fun.\"\\n\\n Jezebel winced, swishing her mists into figure eights, but she didn\u0027t argue back. That\u0027s what made Sheba realize she was serious.\\n\\n Sheba swallowed hard. \"Wow.\"\\n\\n She couldn\u0027t imagine that. Taking all this delicious evil and throwing it away. Giving up a hard-earned pair of horns-horns that Sheba would destroy anything to have right now-and getting stuck with a weak, fully mortal body in return.\\n\\n Sheba eyed Jezebel\u0027s glistening onyx horns and frowned. \"I don\u0027t understand how anyone could do that.\"\\n\\n \"Remember what you said about the angels? Getting distracted by love?\" Jezebel asked. \"Well, hate can be a distraction, too. Look at Lilith and her spiteful good deeds. Maybe it starts out with sticking it to the lesser demons, but who knows where it will lead? Virtue corrupts.\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t believe a few tricks against another demon could make you as stupid as a birdbrain,\" Sheba mumbled under her breath.\\n\\n \"Sheba, don\u0027t underestimate the angels,\" Jezebel chastised. \"You don\u0027t mess with them-you hear? Even a strong middle demon like me knows better than to lock horns with the feather-backs. They steer clear of us, and we steer clear of them. Let the Demon Lords deal with the angels.\"\\n\\n \"I know that, Jezebel. I wasn\u0027t spawned this decade.\"\\n\\n \"Sorry. I\u0027m being helpful again.\" She shuddered. \"I just get so frustrated sometimes! Goodness and light on every side!\"\\n\\n Sheba shook her head. \"I don\u0027t see that. Misery is everywhere.\"\\n\\n \"Happiness is, too, sis. It\u0027s all over the place,\" Jezebel said sadly.\\n\\n It was silent for a long moment as Jezebel\u0027s words lingered in the air. The sticky breeze washed across Sheba\u0027s skin. Miami was no hell, but it was comfortable at least.\\n\\n \"Not at my prom!\" Sheba retorted with sudden fierceness.\\n\\n Jezebel smiled widely-her teeth were black as the night sky. \"That\u0027s just it-that\u0027s why I\u0027m being so un-damnedly helpful. Because we need demonesses like you out there. We need the worst we can get on the front lines. Let the Liliths of the underworld mess around with petty tricks. Get me the Shebas on my side. Get me a thousand Shebas. We\u0027ll win this fight once and for all.\"\\n\\n Sheba considered that for a moment, weighing the fierce purpose in Jezebel\u0027s voice. \"That\u0027s evil in such a strange way. It almost sounds like good.\"\\n\\n \"Twisted, I know.\"\\n\\n They laughed together for the first time.\\n\\n \"Well, get back in there and destroy that prom.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m on it. Go to hell, Jezebel.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/prom-nights-from-hell/page-33.html","bookId":2030,"book":{"id":2030,"title":"Prom Nights from Hell","description":"Storyline: In this exciting collection of paranormal tales, best-selling authors Stephenie Meyer (Twilight), Kim Harrison (Once Dead, Twice Shy), Meg Cabot (How to Be Popular), Lauren Myracle (ttyl), and Michele Jaffe (Bad Kitty) take prom mishaps to a whole new level—a truly hellish level.
