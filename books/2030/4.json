{"id":108583,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"\"You don\u0027t understand.\" Lila tosses back her long blond hair. \"He\u0027s not a tick, Mary. Sebastian loves me too much to bite me. But I know I can change his mind. Because he wants to be with me forever, as much as I want to be with him forever. I know it. And after tomorrow night, we will be together forever.\"\n \"What\u0027s tomorrow night?\" Adam wants to know.\n \"The prom,\" I say woodenly.\n \"Right,\" Lila prattles on. \"Sebastian\u0027s taking me. And though he doesn\u0027t know it yet, he\u0027s going to give in to me there. Just one bite and I\u0027ll have eternal life. Come on, you guys, how cool is that? Wouldn\u0027t you want to live forever? I mean, if you could?\"\n \"Not that way,\" I say. Something inside of me aches. Aches for Lila, and aches for all the girls who\u0027ve gone before her. And will come after her, too, if I don\u0027t do something about it.\n \"He\u0027s meeting you at the dance?\" I force myself to ask her. It\u0027s hard to speak, because all I want to do is cry.\n \"Right,\" Lila says. Her face still has the same vacant expression she wore inside the club, as well as earlier today in the lunchroom. \"He\u0027ll never be able to resist me-not in my new Roberto Cavalli gown, with my neck all exposed beneath the silver light of the full moon...\"\n \"I think I\u0027m going to throw up,\" Ted volunteers.\n \"No, you\u0027re not,\" I say. \"You\u0027re going to take Lila home. Here.\" I reach into my satchel and pull out a crucifix and two containers of holy water, then hand them to him. \"If Drake shows up-although I don\u0027t think he will-throw these at him. Then get yourself home, after you\u0027ve dropped off Lila.\"\n Ted looks down at what I\u0027ve shoved into his hands. \"Wait. That\u0027s it?\" he wants to know. \"We\u0027re just going to let him kill her?\"\n \"Not kill,\" Lila corrects him cheerfully. \"Turn me. Into one of his kind.\"\n \"We aren\u0027t going to do anything,\" I say. \"You guys are going to go home and leave this to me. I\u0027ve got it under control. Just make sure Lila gets back safely. She should be all right until the dance. Evil spirits cannot enter an inhabited house unless invited!\" I narrow my eyes at Lila. \"You didn\u0027t invite him inside, did you?\"\n \"Whatever,\" Lila says, tossing her head. \"Like my dad wouldn\u0027t go too ballistic if he found a guy in my room.\"\n \"See? Go home. You, too,\" I add, to Adam.\n Ted takes Lila by the arm and begins to lead her away.\n But Adam, to my surprise, stays where he is, his hands buried deep in his pockets.\n \"Um,\" I say to him. \"Is there something I can do for you?\"\n \"Yes,\" Adam says calmly. \"You can start at the beginning. I want to know everything. Because if what you\u0027re telling me is true, if it weren\u0027t for me, you\u0027d be a speck on the wall in the club back there. So start talking.\"\n Adam\n If you had told me just an hour or two ago that I\u0027d be ending my evening with a trip to Mary-from-U.S.-History-class\u0027s penthouse apartment over in the East Seventies... well, I\u0027d have told you that you were high.\n But that\u0027s exactly where I find myself, following Mary past her sleepy doorman (who doesn\u0027t raise so much as an eyebrow at her crossbow), and then up the elevator to her place, which is decorated in mid-nineteenth-century Victorian chic-at least as near as I can judge, considering all the furniture looks like it came out of one of those boring miniseries my mom likes to watch on PBS, featuring girls named Violet or Hortense or whatever.\n There are books everywhere-and not Dan Brown paperbacks, either, but big, heavy books, with titles like Demonology in Seventh-century Greece and A Guide to Necromancy. I look around, but I don\u0027t see a plasma screen or an LCD. Not even a regular TV.\n \"Are your parents professors or something?\" I ask Mary as she throws down the crossbow and heads to the kitchen, where she pulls open the fridge and reaches for two Cokes, one of which she hands to me.\n \"Something like that,\" Mary says. This is what she\u0027s been like the whole way to her place: not exactly brimming with the explanations.\n Not that it matters, though, since I already told her I\u0027m not leaving until I get the whole story. The thing is, I really don\u0027t know what to think about all this so far. On the one hand, I\u0027m relieved Drake isn\u0027t who I thought he was-Mary\u0027s ex-boyfriend. On the other hand... a vampire?.\n \"Come on,\" Mary says, and I follow her because... well, what else am I supposed to do? I don\u0027t know what I\u0027m doing here. I don\u0027t believe in vampires. I think Lila\u0027s just gotten herself involved with one of those freaky goth dudes I saw on Law \u0026 Order that one time.\n Although Mary\u0027s question-\"Then how do you explain his disappearance from the dance floor into thin air like that?\" - bugs me. How did the guy do that?\n Then again, there are tons of questions like that one that I don\u0027t have the answers for. Like this new one that occurred to me: How can I get Mary to look at me the way Lila looked at that guy, Drake?\n Life is full of mysteries, as my dad likes to say, many of which are also wrapped up in enigmas.\n Mary leads me down a dark hallway toward a partly open door, from which light spills. She taps on the door, then says, \"Dad? Can we come in?\"\n A gruff voice says, \"By all means.\"\n And I follow Mary into the strangest room I\u0027ve ever seen. At least in a penthouse apartment on the Upper East Side.\n It\u0027s a laboratory. There are test tubes and beakers and vials everywhere. Standing in front of some of them is a tall, white-haired-professor type in a bathrobe, messing around with a concoction in a clear container that\u0027s bright green and vigorously generating large amounts of smoke. The old dude looks up from this and smiles as Mary comes into the room, his green-eyed gaze-a lot like Mary\u0027s-darting toward me curiously.\n \"Well, hello,\" the guy says. \"I see you\u0027ve brought a friend home. I\u0027m so glad. I\u0027ve been thinking lately that you spend far too much time alone, young lady.\"\n \"Dad, this is Adam,\" Mary says casually. \"He sits behind me in U.S. History. We\u0027re going to my room to do homework.\"\n \"How nice,\" Mary\u0027s father says. It doesn\u0027t seem to occur to him that the last thing a guy my age is likely to be doing in a girl\u0027s bedroom at two in the morning is homework. \"Don\u0027t study too hard, now, children.\"\n \"We won\u0027t,\" Mary says. \"Come on, Adam.\"\n \"Good night, sir,\" I say to Mary\u0027s dad, who beams at me before turning back to his smoking beaker.\n \"Okay,\" I say to Mary as she leads me down the hall once more, this time to her room... which is surprisingly utilitarian for a girl\u0027s bedroom, containing only a large bed, a dresser, and a desk. Unlike in Veronica\u0027s room, everything is put away, except for a laptop and an MP3 player. I take a quick look at Mary\u0027s play list when she\u0027s busy rifling around in the closet for something. Mostly rock, some R\u0026B, and a little rap. No emo, though. Thank God. \"What\u0027s going on? What\u0027s your dad doing with all that stuff?\"\n \"Looking for a cure,\" Mary says from the closet, her voice muffled.\n I\u0027ve moved across the ornate Persian carpet toward her bed. There\u0027s a framed photo on her nightstand. It\u0027s of a pretty woman, squinting into the sunlight and smiling. Mary\u0027s mother. I don\u0027t know how I know it. I just do.\n \"A cure for what?\" I ask, picking up the photo for a closer look. Yep, there they are. Mary\u0027s lips. Which, I haven\u0027t been able to stop noticing, are kind of curled up at the ends. Even when she\u0027s mad.\n \"Vampirism,\" Mary says. She emerges from the closet holding a long red dress. It\u0027s wrapped in clear plastic from the dry cleaner\u0027s.\n \"Uh,\" I say, \"I hate to be the one to tell you this, Mary. But there\u0027s no such thing as vampires. Or vampirism. Or whatever it is.\"\n \"Oh yeah?\" The ends of Mary\u0027s mouth are curled up even more than usual.\n \"Vampires were just made up by that guy.\" She\u0027s laughing at me. I don\u0027t mind, though, because it\u0027s Mary. It\u0027s better than her ignoring me, which is what she\u0027s done for most of the time I\u0027ve known her. \"That guy who wrote Dracula. Right?\"\n \"Bram Stoker did not make up vampires,\" Mary says, the smile vanishing. \"He didn\u0027t even make up Dracula. Who\u0027s an actual historical figure, by the way.\"\n \"Yeah, but a dude who drinks blood and can turn into a bat? Come on.\"\n \"Vampires exist, Adam,\" Mary says quietly. I like how she says my name. I like it so much that I don\u0027t even notice at first that she\u0027s staring at the photo I\u0027m holding. \"And so do their victims.\"\n I follow the direction of her gaze. And nearly drop the photo.\n \"Mary,\" I say. Because it\u0027s all I can think of to say. \"Your... your mom? Is she... did she...\"\n \"She\u0027s still alive,\" Mary says, turning to throw the red dress, in its slippery clear plastic bag, onto the bed. \"If you can call it living,\" she adds, almost to herself.\n \"Mary...\" I say in a different tone of voice. I can\u0027t believe it.\n And yet I do. There\u0027s something in her face that makes it clear she\u0027s not lying. Also something that makes me long to wrap her in my arms. Which Veronica would say is sexist. But there you go.\n I let go of the lip I\u0027ve started chewing. \"Is that why your dad-\"\n \"He wasn\u0027t always like that,\" she says, not looking at me. \"He used to be different, when Mom was here. He... he thinks he can find a chemical cure for it.\" She sinks onto the bed beside the dress. \"He doesn\u0027t want to believe that there\u0027s only one way to get her back. And that\u0027s killing the vampire who made her into one.\"\n \"Drake,\" I say, sinking down onto the bed beside her. It all makes sense now. I guess.\n \"No,\" Mary says with a quick shake of her head. \"His father. Who happened to stick with the original family name of Dracula. His son just thinks Drake sounds a little less pretentious and more modern.\"\n \"So... why were you trying to kill Dracula\u0027s kid, if his dad is the one who...\" I can\u0027t even bring myself to say it. Fortunately, I don\u0027t have to.\n Mary\u0027s shoulders are hunched. \"If killing his only kid doesn\u0027t get Dracula to come out of hiding so I can kill him, too, I don\u0027t know what will.\"\n \"Won\u0027t that be, uh... kind of dangerous?\" I ask. I can\u0027t believe I\u0027m sitting here talking about this. But I can\u0027t believe I\u0027m in Mary-from-U.S.-History\u0027s bedroom, either. \"I mean, isn\u0027t Dracula, like, the head of the whole operation?\"\n \"Yes,\" Mary says, looking down at the photo I\u0027ve laid between us. \"And when he\u0027s gone, Mom will finally be free.\"\n And Mary\u0027s dad won\u0027t have to worry about finding a cure for vampirism anymore, I think, but don\u0027t say out loud.\n \"Why didn\u0027t Drake just, uh, turn Lila tonight?\" I ask. Because this has been bothering me. Among other things. \"I mean, back at the club?\"\n \"Because he likes to play with his food,\" Mary says emotionlessly. \"Just like his dad.\"\n \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/prom-nights-from-hell/page-4.html","bookId":2030,"book":{"id":2030,"title":"Prom Nights from Hell","description":"Storyline: \n In this exciting collection of paranormal tales, best-selling authors Stephenie Meyer (Twilight), Kim Harrison (Once Dead, Twice Shy), Meg Cabot (How to Be Popular), Lauren Myracle (ttyl), and Michele Jaffe (Bad Kitty) take prom mishaps to a whole new level—a truly hellish level.
