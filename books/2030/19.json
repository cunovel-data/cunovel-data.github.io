{"id":108598,"no":19,"title":"Page 19","content":"Miranda loved the Santa Barbara airport, the way it looked more like an Acapulco Joe\u0027s Cantina than an official building with its adobe-style walls, cool terra-cotta floor, loopy blue and gold tile, and bougainvillaea careening down the walls. It was small, so planes just parked where they landed and had staircases wheeled out to them, with only a chain-link fence separating people waiting for someone from the people coming off the plane.\n Pulling the welcome sign out of the Town Car, she checked the name on it-CUMEAN-and held it up in the direction of the disembarking passengers. As she waited, she listened to a woman in the gold Lexus SUV four cars behind her talking on her phone, saying, \"If she gets off the plane, I\u0027ll know. He\u0027d better have his checkbook ready,\" then tilted her head to focus on the low srloop srloop srloop sound of a snail slithering across the still-warm pavement toward a bunch of ivy.\n She still remembered the exact moment she realized that not everyone heard the things she heard, that she wasn\u0027t normal. She\u0027d already spent the first half of her seventh-grade year at Saint Bartolomeo School-the part after the screening of the Your Body Is Changing: Womanhood video-puzzled by all the changes they didn\u0027t list, like uncontrolled bursts of speed and randomly crushing objects you were just trying to pick up and hitting your head on the ceiling of the gym when you were doing jumping jacks and suddenly being able to see dust particles on people\u0027s clothes. But since Sister Anna answered all her questions with \"Stop joking, child,\" Miranda thought they must just be so obvious the movie didn\u0027t need to mention them. It was only when she\u0027d tried to earn Johnnie Voight\u0027s undying affection by warning him not to cheat off of Cynthia Riley again because, based on the sound of her pencil five seats away, she always got the wrong answers, that Miranda learned just how \"differently abled\" she was. Instead of falling on his knees and declaring that she was his goddess in a training bra and plaid skirt, Johnnie had called her a freak, then a nosy bitch, and tried to beat her up.\n That was how she\u0027d first learned how dangerous powers were, the way they could make you an outcast.\n And also that she was stronger than boys her age, and that they didn\u0027t think that was cool or even good. And neither did school administrators.\n Since then she\u0027d become expert at acting normal, being careful. Had mastered her powers. Or she\u0027d thought she had, until seven months earlier when-\n Miranda pushed the memory aside and turned her attention back to the people at the airport. To her job. She watched a little girl with blond ringlets sitting on her dad\u0027s shoulders standing next to the path and waving as a woman walked from the plane toward them, now shouting, \"Mommy, Mommy, I missed you!\"\n She watched the happy family hug and felt like someone had socked her in the stomach. One of the advantages of going to boarding school, Miranda thought, was that you didn\u0027t get invited over to people\u0027s houses, never had to see them acting like normal families, having breakfast together. For some reason, whenever she imagined truly happy families, they were always eating breakfast.\n Plus people who had normal families didn\u0027t go to Chatsworth Academy, \"The Premier Boarding Experience in Southern California.\" Or, as Miranda liked to think of it, Child Warehouse, the place where parents (or in her case, guardians) stored their children until they needed them for something.\n With the possible exception of her roommate, Kenzi.\n She and Kenzi Chin had lived together for four years, since their freshman year, longer than Miranda had lived with almost anyone. Kenzi came from a perfect-eat-breakfast-together family, had perfect skin, perfect grades, perfect everything, and Miranda would have been forced to hate her if Kenzi wasn\u0027t also so completely loyal and kind. And a tinsy bit insane.\n Like earlier that afternoon when Miranda walked into their room and found her standing on her head, wearing only underpants, with her entire body slathered in drying mint-colored mud.\n \"I am so going to be in therapy for the rest of my life to get this image out of my mind,\" Miranda told her.\n \"You\u0027re going to need to be in therapy that long anyway to deal with your messed-up family. I\u0027m just giving you some TTD material to talk about.\" Kenzi knew more about Miranda\u0027s family history than anyone else at Chatsworth, almost all of it fabricated. The part about it being messed up, though, was true.\n Kenzi also really liked acronyms and invented new ones all the time. As she dropped her bag and collapsed on her bed, Miranda asked, \"TTD?\"\n \"Totally Top Drawer.\" Then Kenzi said, \"I can\u0027t believe you\u0027re not coming to prom. I always pictured us going together.\"\n \"I don\u0027t think Beth would like that too much. You know, being the third wheel.\"\n Beth was Kenzi\u0027s girlfriend. \"Don\u0027t even talk to me about that creature,\" she said now, giving a fake shudder. \"The Beth and Kenzi Show is officially canceled.\"\n \"As of when?\"\n \"What time is it?\"\n \"Three thirty-five.\"\n \"Two hours and six minutes ago.\"\n \"Oh, so it\u0027ll be back on by prom.\"\n \"Of course.\"\n Kenzi\u0027s ?cancellations? happened about once a week and never lasted more than four hours. She thought the drama of breakups and the thrill of reconciliation kept a relationship fresh. And in some weird way it seemed to work, because she and Beth were the happiest couple Miranda knew. More perfection.\n \"Anyway, stop trying to change the subject. I think you\u0027re making a grave mistake by missing prom.\"\n \"Yeah, I\u0027m sure I\u0027ll never forgive myself.\"\n \"I\u0027m serious.\"\n \"Why? What\u0027s the big deal? It\u0027s a big dance with a dorky theme. You know I\u0027m dancelexic and should not be allowed out on a dance floor near other people.\"\n \"A Sweet Salute to the Red, White, and Blue isn\u0027t dorky, it\u0027s patriotic. And you do okay with the Hustle.\"\n \"I think Libby Geer would disagree with you. If her mouth weren\u0027t still wired shut.\"\n \"Whatever, prom isn\u0027t just a big dance. It\u0027s a rite of passage, a moment when we move from who we were into the vastness of the adults we\u0027re going to become, throwing off the weight of our youthful insecurities to-\"\n \" - get drunk and maybe lucky. Depending on your definition of luck.\"\n \"You\u0027ll be sorry if you don\u0027t come. Do you really want to grow up miserable and filled with regret?\"\n \"Yes, please! Besides, I have to work.\"\n \"TGI as If. You\u0027re hiding behind your job again. You could so get one Saturday off. At least be honest about why you\u0027re not going.\"\n Miranda gave Kenzi Innocent Eyes, expression number two from the kissing book. \"I don\u0027t know what you mean.\"\n \"Don\u0027t look at me like you\u0027re My Little Pony. I have four letters for you: W-I�CL-L.\"\n \"And I have four letters for you: N-O-P-E. Oh and four more: M-Y-O-\"\n But Kenzi just went on, ignoring her, something she did professionally. \"It\u0027s true that Will might need to be vaccinated or screened for diseases after going with Ariel, but I can\u0027t believe you\u0027re giving up that easily.\"\n Will Javelin filled up about 98 percent of Miranda\u0027s dreams. She\u0027d been trying to cut it out since she learned he was going to the prom with Ariel-\"I named my new breasts after my family\u0027s country houses, does your family have any country houses, Miranda? Oh right, I forgot, you\u0027re a foster child\"-West, of the West-Sugar-Is-Best! fortune, but it was a challenge. To avoid bad karma Miranda said, \"There\u0027s nothing wrong with Ariel.\"\n \"Yeah, nothing that couldn\u0027t be cured with an exorcism.\" Kenzi came out of her headstand, planting her feet on the floor. She reached for her towel. \"At least promise you\u0027ll come to the after-party. At Sean\u0027s parents\u0027 place on the beach? You will, right? We\u0027re all going to hang around and watch the sun rise. It will give you a chance to talk to Will outside of school. And when are you going to tell me what happened between you two that other night, anyway? Why are you being so MLAS about it?\"\n Miranda knew that one. \"I\u0027m not being My Lips Are Sealed,\" she said, picking up a pile of papers on the bookshelf between her and Kenzi\u0027s beds and straightening them.\n \"You\u0027re doing that thing again. The thing where you pretend to be Holly Homemaker to avoid having a discussion.\"\n \"Maybe.\" Miranda was looking at the papers now, photocopies of newspaper articles from the past half year. \"Purse snatcher caught by mysterious Good Samaritan, found bound to fence with yo-yo,\" the first and most recent said. Then, from a few months before, \"Get a grip: Stickup foiled when robber loses control of gun. Witness says Pez dispenser \u0027came out of nowhere\u0027 to knock weapon from assailant\u0027s hand.\" Finally, from seven months earlier, \"Convenience store heist getaway halted by falling lightpost; two arrested.\" She started to get a sinking feeling in her stomach.\n At least it was only three out of, what, a dozen different incidents she told herself. But that didn\u0027t really make her feel better. No one was supposed to link any of those events together. Ever.\n The convenience store was the first one. It was dusk, fog coming off the ocean, the streetlights making misty halos in the air. She\u0027d been driving down a side street in Santa Barbara on her way to roller derby practice when she\u0027d heard the threats from inside Ron\u0027s 24-Hour Open Market #3 and just... acted. She\u0027d had no control over what she did, it was like she was in a dream, her body knowing exactly what to do, where the robbers would go, how to stop them. Coming back to her the way the words from a favorite song did even if you hadn\u0027t heard it in years. Only she had no idea where it was coming back from.\n She\u0027d spent the three days following the convenience store incident in bed, curled in a ball, trembling. She told Kenzi she had the flu, but really what she had was terror. She was terrified of the powers she suddenly couldn\u0027t restrain.\n Terrified because using them felt so good. So right. Like she was alive for the first time.\n Terrified because she knew what could happen if people found out. To her. And to-\n She waved the copies toward Kenzi, demanding, \"What are you doing with these?\"\n \"Whoa, Drill Sergeant Kiss in the house,\" Kenzi said, saluting. \"All due respect, ma\u0027am, but as they say in the military, SSTB. You won\u0027t get away with changing the subject just by using your scary voice.\"\n SSTB stood for So Sad Too Bad. Miranda couldn\u0027t not laugh. \"If I were trying to change the subject, army of one, I\u0027d point out that the stuff on your body is flaking all over the rug your mother\u0027s decorator tracked over three continents because it supposedly belonged to Lucy Lawless. I seriously want to know, why are you interested in street crime in Santa Barbara?\"\n Kenzi stepped from the rug onto the wood floor. \"Not street crime in Santa Barbara, foiled street crime. It\u0027s for my journalism final project. Some people are saying there\u0027s a mystical force at work. Maybe even Santa Barbara come back herself.\"\n \"Can\u0027t it just be a coincidence? Criminals mess up all the time, right?\"\n \"People don\u0027t like coincidences. Like the way it\u0027s no coincidence that you are trying to make me talk about this rather than answer my questions about what happened with you and Will. One minute it looks like you two are totally-and I might add, finally-hooking up and the next you are back here in our room. Ruining, I might also add, a totally ace romantic evening for me.\"\n \"I did tell you,\" Miranda groaned. \"It was nothing. Nothing happened.\"\n Slouching against the Town Car now as the last of the daylight faded, Miranda thought that nothing was an understatement. It had been worse than nothing. That expression on Will\u0027s face, the one that hovered between you\u0027ve-got-something-green-caught-in-your-teeth and oh-hello-Professor-Crazy, a mixture of horror and, well, horror, when she\u0027d finally gotten up the guts to-\n That\u0027s when it hit her. The articles on Kenzi\u0027s desk had all come out on Thursdays, reporting on things that had happened-things she\u0027d done-on Wednesdays.\n \"Wednesday and Saturday afternoons free,\" she heard Caleb saying, repeating her words.\n That was bad. That was really bad. She was going to have to lay low.\n The gold Lexus SUV behind her pulled away from the curb and Miranda could hear the couple inside fighting over the sound of their air conditioner. The woman at the wheel turning her head to yell at her husband-Don\u0027t lie to me! I know you were with her! - hitting the gas hard right as the family with the little blond girl stepped into the crosswalk in front of her...\n Afterward no one was really sure what had happened.\n One second the car was careening toward the family in the crosswalk, the next there was a blur and they were on the curb, bewildered but safe.\n As she watched the gold SUV speed off into the distance, Miranda felt the adrenaline thrill she always got after she\u0027d acted without thinking, saved someone. It was addictive, like a drug.\n And dangerous, like a drug, she reminded herself.\n I think you should get yourself a dictionary. That is not what \"laying low\" means.\n Shut up. It was only a handspring and a little push. Hardly some big tactical maneuver.\n You shouldn\u0027t have done it. It was too risky. You\u0027re not invisible, you know.\n But I wasn\u0027t seen. It was fine.\n This time.\n Miranda wondered if everyone had a voice in their head permanently set to the U-Suck channel.\n What are you trying to do, anyway? Do you think you can save everyone? When you couldn\u0027t even-\n Shut up.\n \"What?\" a girl\u0027s voice asked and Miranda was startled to realize she\u0027d spoken aloud, and someone was standing there.\n The girl was about Miranda\u0027s height but younger, maybe fourteen, and dressed like she\u0027d been studying early Madonna videos and wanted to be sure that if mesh shirts worn over bras, fingerless gloves, teased hair, thick black eyeliner, rubber bracelets, petticoat skirts with fishnets, and ankle boots came back in style, she\u0027d be ready.\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" Miranda said, \"I was talking to myself.\" Not exactly how the Mature Driver Person she was supposed to be should act.\n \"Oh.\" The girl held the sign with the word CUMEAN on it out to Miranda. \"You\u0027ll want this. And this,\" she said, handing her a small square box.\n Miranda took the sign but shook her head at the box. \"That\u0027s not mine.\"\n \"It must be. And me, too. I mean, I\u0027m Sibby Cumean.\" She pointed at the sign.\n Miranda pocketed the box to open the back door for the girl, wondering what kind of parent let their fourteen-year-old get picked up by a stranger at eight at night.\n \"Can\u0027t I ride in front?\"\n \"Clients prefer the back,\" Miranda said in her most professional voice.\n \"What you really mean is that you prefer it when they ride in the back. But what if I want to ride in the front? Don\u0027t clients get to do what they want?\"\n 5Bs Luxury Transport was named after a set of principles the owner, Tony Bosun, had made up-B on time, B polite, B accommodating, B discreet, B sure to get paid. Even though Miranda suspected he\u0027d come up with them when he was drunk late one night, she tried to follow the rules and she was pretty sure this counted as B accommodating. She moved to open the front door.\n The girl shook her head. \"Never mind. I\u0027ll stay in back.\"\n Miranda plastered on a smile. What a rad day she was having! Her VIP client was a tiny demon, her dream guy was going to the prom with someone else, and the sheriff\u0027s deputy she had a crush on not only knew it but joked about it with his girlfriend! Awesome.\n At least, she told herself, things couldn\u0027t possibly get any worse.\n Oh, now you\u0027ve done it.\n Shut up. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/prom-nights-from-hell/page-19.html","bookId":2030,"book":{"id":2030,"title":"Prom Nights from Hell","description":"Storyline: \n In this exciting collection of paranormal tales, best-selling authors Stephenie Meyer (Twilight), Kim Harrison (Once Dead, Twice Shy), Meg Cabot (How to Be Popular), Lauren Myracle (ttyl), and Michele Jaffe (Bad Kitty) take prom mishaps to a whole new level—a truly hellish level.
