{"id":108587,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"Gee, thanks, Madame Z, I thought. Could we dig a little deeper here? Give me something to work with?\\n\\n \"But is he-I mean, the person-going to act on his passion?\" I was brazen, despite my knotted stomach.\\n\\n \"To act or not to act... that is the question?\" Madame Z said.\\n\\n \"Yes, that is the question.\"\\n\\n \"Ahhh. That is always the question. And what one must always ask oneself-\" She broke off. Her eyes flew to Will, and she paled.\\n\\n \"What?\" I demanded.\\n\\n \"Nothing,\" she said.\\n\\n \"Something,\" I said. Her message-from-the-spirits performance wasn\u0027t fooling me. She wanted us to think she\u0027d been suddenly possessed? That she\u0027d had a stark and powerful vision? Fine! Just get to the bloody answer!\\n\\n Madame Z made a show of pulling herself together, complete with a long, shaky draw on her cigarette. Looking dead at me, she said, \"If a tree falls in a forest, and no one\u0027s there to hear it, does it still make a sound?\"\\n\\n \"Huh?\" I said.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s all I\u0027ve got. Take it or leave it.\" She seemed agitated, so I took it. Although I made cuckoo eyes at Yun Sun when Madame Z wasn\u0027t watching.\\n\\n Will claimed not to have a specific question, but Madame Z was oddly insistent on relaying a message to him anyhow. She waved her hands over his aura and warned him sternly of heights, which was curiously appropriate as Will was an avid rock climber. What was more curious was Will\u0027s reaction. First his eyebrows shot up, and then a different emotion took over, like some secret anticipatory pleasure. He glanced at me and blushed.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s going on?\" I asked. \"You have your sneaky face on.\"\\n\\n \"Exsqueeze me?\" he said.\\n\\n \"What are you not telling us, Will Goodman?\"\\n\\n \"Nothing, I swear!\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t be stupid, boy!\" Madame Z harped. \"Listen to what I\u0027m saying.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, you don\u0027t have to worry about him,\" I said. \"He\u0027s a total Mr. Safety.\" I turned back to Will. \"For real. Do you have a fabulous new climbing spot? A brand-new shiny carabiner?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s Yun Sun\u0027s turn,\" Will said. \"Yun Sun, go.\"\\n\\n \"Can you read palms?\" Yun Sun asked Madame Z.\\n\\n Madame Z exhaled, and she was barely engaged as she traced her finger over the plump pad below Yun Sun\u0027s thumb. \"You will be as beautiful as you allow yourself to be,\" she told her. That was it. Those were her pearls of wisdom.\\n\\n Yun Sun seemed as underwhelmed as I was, and I felt like protesting on all our behalves. I mean, seriously! A tree in the forest? Be careful of heights? You will be as beautiful as you allow yourself to be? Even with her somewhat convincing touches of atmospheric creepiness, the three of us were getting cheated. Me in particular.\\n\\n But before I could say anything, a cell phone on the desk rang. Madame Z picked it up and used a long orange nail to punch the talk button.\\n\\n \"Madame Zanzibar, at your service,\" she said. Her expression changed as she listened to whoever was on the other end. She grew brisk and annoyed. \"No, Silas. It\u0027s called a... yes, you can say it, a yeast infection. Yeast infection.\"\\n\\n Yun Sun and I shared a glance of horror, although-I couldn\u0027t help it-I was also delighted. Not that Madame Z had a yeast infection. I mean, ick. But that she was discussing it with Silas, whoever he was, while all of us listened in. Now we were getting our money\u0027s worth.\\n\\n \"Tell the pharmacist it\u0027s the second time this month,\" Madame Z groused. \"I need something stronger. What? For the itching, you idiot! Unless he wants to scratch it for me!\" She twisted on her swivel chair, pumping one Juicy Coutured leg over the other.\\n\\n Will looked up at me, his brown eyes wide with alarm. \"I will not be scratching it for her,\" he stage-whispered. \"I refuse!\"\\n\\n I laughed, thinking it a good sign that he was showing off for me. The Madame Z experience hadn\u0027t gone as intended, but who knew? Maybe it would end up having the desired effect after all.\\n\\n Madame Z pointed at me with the lit end of her cigarette, and I ducked my chin contritely, like Sorry, sorry. To distract myself, I focused on the strange and varied clutter on her shelves. A book called Magic of the Ordinary and another titled What to Do When the Dead Speak-But You Don\u0027t Want to Listen. I nudged Will with my knee and pointed. He mimed choking the poor deceased bastard, and I snortled.\\n\\n Above the books I saw: a bottle of rat poison, an old-fashioned monocle, a jar of what looked like fingernail clippings, a stained Starbucks cup, and a rabbit\u0027s foot, claws attached. And on the shelf above that was... oh, lovely.\\n\\n \"Is that a skull?\" I asked Will.\\n\\n Will whistled. \"Holy cannoli.\"\\n\\n \"Okey-doke,\" Yun Sun said, averting her eyes. \"If there really is a skull, I don\u0027t want to know about it. Can we leave now?\"\\n\\n I took her head in my hands and pointed her in the right direction. \"Look. It still has hair!\"\\n\\n Madame Z snapped her cell phone shut. \"Fools, every one of them,\" she said. Her pallor was gone; apparently talking to Silas had shaken her out of her funk.\\n\\n \"Ahh! I see you found Fernando!\"\\n\\n \"Is that whose skull that is?\" I asked. \"Fernando\u0027s?\"\\n\\n \"Oh God,\" Yun Sun moaned.\\n\\n \"Wormed his way to the surface after a gully washer, out in Chapel Hill Cemetery,\" Madame Z told us. \"His coffin, that is. Crappy wooden thing, must\u0027a been from the early nineteen hundreds. No one left to care for him, so I took pity on him and brought him here.\"\\n\\n \"You opened the coffin?\" I said.\\n\\n \"Yep.\" She seemed proud. I wondered if she\u0027d worn her Juicy Couture during the grave robbing.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s gross that it still has hair,\" I said.\\n\\n \"He still has hair,\" Madame Z said. \"Show some respect.\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t know dead bodies had hair, that\u0027s all.\"\\n\\n \"Skin, no,\" Madame Z said. \"Skin starts to rot right away, and believe me, you don\u0027t want to smell it when it goes. But hair? Sometimes it keeps growing for weeks after the deceased has made his crossing.\"\\n\\n \"Wowzers.\" I reached down and tousled Will\u0027s honey-colored curls. \"Hear that, Will? Sometimes the hair keeps growing.\"\\n\\n \"Amazing,\" he said.\\n\\n \"What about that?\" Yun Sun asked, pointing to a clear Tupperware container in which something reddish and organlike floated in clear liquid. \"Please tell me it didn\u0027t come from Fernando, too. Please.\"\\n\\n Madame Z waved her hand, like Don\u0027t be ridiculous. \"That\u0027s my uterus. Had the doc give it to me after my hysterectomy.\"\\n\\n \"Your uterus?\" Yun Sun looked ill.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m going to let \u0027em toss it in the incinerator?\" Madame Z said. \"Fat chance!\"\\n\\n \"And that?\" I pointed to a clump of dried-up something on the highest shelf. This show-and-tell was proving far more enjoyable than our actual readings.\\n\\n Madame Z followed my gaze. She opened her mouth, then closed it. \"That\u0027s nothing,\" she said firmly, although I noticed she had a hard time tearing her eyes from it. \"Now. Are we done here?\"\\n\\n \"Come on.\" I made praying hands. \"Tell us what it is.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t want to know,\" she said.\\n\\n \"I do,\" I said.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t,\" Yun Sun said.\\n\\n \"Yes, she does,\" I said. \"And so does Will. Right, Will?\"\\n\\n \"It can\u0027t be worse than the uterus,\" he said.\\n\\n Madame Z pressed her lips together.\\n\\n \"Please?\" I begged.\\n\\n She muttered something under her breath about idiot teenagers and how she refused to take the blame, whatever came of it. Then she stood up, pawing the top shelf. Her bosom didn\u0027t jiggle, but stayed firm and rigid beneath her top. She retrieved the clump and placed it in front of us.\\n\\n \"Oh,\" I breathed. \"A corsage.\" Brittle rosebuds, their edges brown and papery. Sprigs of graying baby\u0027s breath, so desiccated that puffs of fiber dusted the table. A limp red ribbon holding it all together.\\n\\n \"A peasant woman in France put a spell on it,\" Madame Z said in a tone that was hard to decipher. It was as if she were compelled to speak the words, even though she didn\u0027t want to. Or, no. More like she did want to but was struggling to resist. \"She wanted to show that true love is guided by fate, and that anyone who tries to interfere does so at her own peril.\"\\n\\n She moved to return the corsage. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/prom-nights-from-hell/page-8.html","bookId":2030,"book":{"id":2030,"title":"Prom Nights from Hell","description":"Storyline: In this exciting collection of paranormal tales, best-selling authors Stephenie Meyer (Twilight), Kim Harrison (Once Dead, Twice Shy), Meg Cabot (How to Be Popular), Lauren Myracle (ttyl), and Michele Jaffe (Bad Kitty) take prom mishaps to a whole new level—a truly hellish level.
