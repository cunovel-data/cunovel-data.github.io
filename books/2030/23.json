{"id":108602,"no":23,"title":"Page 23","content":"\"He didn\u0027t even know you were there,\" Sibby said. \"He never even knew who hit him.\" \"That was the idea.\" They were parked next to an abandoned Amtrak maintenance building on an old part of the train tracks that was completely hidden from the street. It was the place Miranda had started coming seven months earlier to work out all her new crazy energy and try things she couldn\u0027t practice anywhere else-Roller Derby was great for speed, balance, gymnastics, and shoving moves, but you weren\u0027t supposed to use advanced judo. Or weapons. She could make out marks from her last crossbow exercise on the side of the building, and the piece of railroad track she\u0027d tied in a knot the day after Will rejected her was still lying on the ground. She\u0027d never seen anyone else here, and she was sure she and Sibby would be pretty much invisible as long as they stayed parked. \"Where did you learn to knock people out like that?\" Sibby asked, sprawled out over the backseat. \"Can you teach me?\" \"No.\" \"Why not? Just one move?\" \"Absolutely not.\" \"Why did you say you were sorry after you hit him?\" Miranda swiveled to face her. \"It\u0027s my turn to ask questions. Who wants to kill you and why?\" \"Gods, I don\u0027t know. It could be a ton of people. It\u0027s not like that, how you think it is.\" \"What\u0027s it like then?\" \"It\u0027s complicated. But if we can just hang out until four in the morning, there\u0027s a place I can go.\" \"That\u0027s six hours from now.\" \"That\u0027ll give me time for at least ten more kisses.\" \"Well, of course. What else would you do while someone is trying to kill you besides go out and tongue tango with as many strangers as possible?\" \"They weren\u0027t trying to kill me, they were trying to abduct me. It\u0027s totally different. Come on, I want to do something fun. Something with boys.\" \"Or we could not do that.\" \"Look, just because you are a founding member of Down with Fun Inc. doesn\u0027t mean that the rest of us want to sign up.\" \"I am not a founding member of Down with Fun Inc. I like fun. But-\" \"Funkiller.\" \" - somehow the idea of wandering around while \u0027a ton of people\u0027 are trying to kidnap you, doesn\u0027t sound fun to me. It sounds like a good way to get into the Guinness Book of World Records under \u0027Plan, comma, World\u0027s Most Stupid. Plus innocent bystanders could get caught in the middle when the ton of people find you.\" \"\u0027If, not \u0027when. And they don\u0027t care about anyone but me.\" Miranda rolled her eyes and turned back around. \"That\u0027s why they\u0027re called innocent bystanders. Because they were standing by you and accidentally got hurt.\" \"Then you should definitely get away from me. Seriously, although there\u0027s nothing I\u0027d rather do than sit parked in a homeless person\u0027s bathroom for six hours with only you for company, I think it would be safer for both of us if I take my chances elsewhere. Like at that ice cream place we passed on the way here. Did you see the lips on the guy behind the counter? They were mythic. Drop me there and I\u0027ll be all set.\" \"You\u0027re so not going anywhere.\" \"Really? Because that sound you hear? Is me reaching for the door handle.\" \"Really? Because that sound you hear? Is me engaging the child lock.\" In the rearview mirror, Miranda saw Sibby\u0027s eyes blaze. \"You\u0027re really mean,\" Sibby said. \"Something horrible must have happened to you to make you so mean.\" \"I\u0027m not mean. I\u0027m just trying to keep you safe.\" \"Are you sure it\u0027s me you\u0027re thinking about? Not some skeleton in your closet? Like the time you-\" Miranda turned up the radio. \"Turn that down! I was talking and I\u0027m the customer.\" \"Not anymore.\" Sibby yelled really loud, \"What happened to your sister?\" \"I don\u0027t know what you are talking about,\" Miranda yelled back. \"That\u0027s a lie.\" Miranda didn\u0027t say anything. \"I asked you before if you had a sister and you got all teary,\" Sibby shouted in her ear. \"Why won\u0027t you tell me?\" Miranda turned down the radio. \"Can you give me three good reasons why I should?\" \"It might make you feel better. It would give us something to talk about while we sit here. And if you don\u0027t tell me, I\u0027m going to start guessing.\" Miranda leaned her head back, checked her watch, and turned to stare out the window. \"Be my guest.\" \"You bugged her so much she left? You bored her so much she left? Or did you drive her away with the huge stick you keep up your butt?\" \"Stop being tender with my feelings. Go on, tell me what you really think.\" From the backseat Sibby said, \"That might have been too mean. Sorry.\" Miranda didn\u0027t say anything. \"You don\u0027t really have a stick in your butt. You couldn\u0027t drive then, right? Ha-ha?\" Silence. \"But I mean, you started it. With the child-lock thing. I\u0027m not a child. I\u0027m fourteen.\" More silence. \"I said I was sorry.\" In the backseat Sibby slumped, sighed. \"Fine. Be that way.\" Silence. Until, for no reason she could explain, Miranda said, \"They died.\" Sibby sat up quick now, leaning toward the front seat. \"Who? Your sisters?\" \"Everyone. My whole family.\" \"Was it because of something you did?\" \"Yes. And because of something I didn\u0027t do. I think.\" \"Um, Grandma Grim, that doesn\u0027t make any sense. How can not doing something-wait, you think?. Don\u0027t you know what happened?\" \"I can\u0027t really remember anything from that part of my life.\" \"You mean from that day?\" \"No. From that year. And the year after. Anything pretty much from when I was ten until when I turned twelve. And there are a few other holes, too.\" \"You mean that stuff is just too painful to remember?\" \"No, it\u0027s just... gone. All I have are impressions.\" And the dreams. Really really bad dreams. \"Like what?\" \"Like that I wasn\u0027t where I should have been and something happened and I let everyone down...\" She stopped, waved a hand in the air. \"Wait, you actually think you could have stopped whatever happened to them? By yourself? When you were four years younger than me?\" Miranda\u0027s throat felt like it was closing up. She\u0027d never told anyone even that much of her real history before, never talked about it, not even with Kenzi. Ever. She swallowed hard. \"I could have tried. I could have been there and tried.\" \"Oh my gods, now this is some kind of pity party. Yawn. Wake me when you\u0027re done.\" Miranda gaped at her in the mirror. \"I told you I didn\u0027t want to talk about it but you kept bugging me and now you turn into the mayor of TellItLikeItIsVille?\" Swallowing again. \"You little-\" \"You don\u0027t even know what happened! How can you feel so bad about it? Plus, I don\u0027t see how that can be your fault. You weren\u0027t even there and you were only ten. I think you should stop obsessing about some mystery thing that is ancient history and live in the mo.\" \"I\u0027m sorry, did you just tell me to \u0027live in the mo\u0027?\" \"Yes. You know, ditch the past and try focusing on what\u0027s going on in the present. Like that the song on the radio right now? Sucks. And that there is a whole city of cute boys out there I am not kissing.\" Miranda took a deep breath, but before she could say anything, Sibby went on. \"I know, I know you say you\u0027re sorry to the people you knock out because you never got to say sorry to your family, and you have to keep me safe because you couldn\u0027t keep them safe. I get it now.\" \"That is not what\u0027s going on. I-\" \"Blah blah blah, insert denials here. Anyway, why does \u0027safe\u0027 have to mean sitting in this car with you all night? Isn\u0027t there somewhere we could blend in? Instead of hiding? I\u0027m good at blending. I\u0027m like butter.\" \"Oh yeah, you\u0027re totally like butter. In fact, in your Madonna-called-and-she-wants-her-costume-from-the-\u0027Borderline\u0027-video-back outfit, you\u0027re practically invisible.\" \"Good one, Funkiller. Come on, let\u0027s go somewhere.\" Miranda turned all the way around in her seat and said, \"Let me sound it out for you. Someone. Is. Trying. To. Kill. You.\" \"No. They. Are. Not. You keep saying that, but I\u0027ve told you. They can\u0027t kill me. You should really work on this obsession you have with people getting killed. And I have to be honest with you, I\u0027m getting bored. What do you have the radio set to, K-CRAP? There is no way we are staying in this car for six hours.\" Miranda had to agree with her. Because if they did, it was now clear she\u0027d kill Sibby herself. That\u0027s when she thought of the perfect place for them to go. \"You want to blend in?\" she asked. \"Yes. With boys.\" \"Guys,\" Miranda said. \"What?\" \"Normal American girls from this century call them guys, not boys. If you want to blend in.\" For a second, Sibby looked shocked. Then she gave a little smile. \"Oh. Yes. Guys.\" \"\u0027Yeah, not \u0027yes. Unless you\u0027re talking to a grown-up.\" \"Yeah.\" \"And it\u0027s \u0027Oh my God\u0027 or \u0027God, not \u0027gods. \" \"Did I-?\" \"Yeah. And no one ever has or ever will say, \u0027live in the mo. \" \"Just wait.\" \"No. Never. Oh, and no paying guys for kisses. You don\u0027t need to. They should feel lucky to kiss you.\" Sibby frowned. \"Why are you being so nice to me and helping me? You don\u0027t even like me.\" \"Because I know what it\u0027s like to be far from home, alone, trying to fit in. And to never be able to tell anyone the truth about who you are.\" After they\u0027d been driving in silence for a few minutes, Sibby said, \"Have you ever killed someone with your bare hands?\" Miranda looked at her in the rearview. \"Not yet.\" \"Ha-ha.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/prom-nights-from-hell/page-23.html","bookId":2030,"book":{"id":2030,"title":"Prom Nights from Hell","description":"Storyline: In this exciting collection of paranormal tales, best-selling authors Stephenie Meyer (Twilight), Kim Harrison (Once Dead, Twice Shy), Meg Cabot (How to Be Popular), Lauren Myracle (ttyl), and Michele Jaffe (Bad Kitty) take prom mishaps to a whole new level—a truly hellish level.
