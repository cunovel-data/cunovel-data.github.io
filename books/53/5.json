{"id":1578,"no":5,"title":"Chapter 5 David comes home","content":"We decided that Alan would stay hidden in the fields，while I walked to Queensferry to find Mr Rankeillor．Alan promised not to come out until he heard me return． In order to be sure that it was me， he taught me to whistle a little Gaelic song．I have never forgotten it．I think that it will run in my head when I lie dying． Every time it comes to me， I think of that last day of my travels， with Alan whistling oppo site me in the grass， while the first light of the sun touched his face．\n Soon I arrived in Queensferry．When I saw people looking strangely at me， and realized how dirty my clothes were， I be gan to feel afraid． Would Mr Rankeillor want to talk to me？How could I prove who I was？ I had no papers with me． I was too ashamed to ask any of the townspeople for help，so I walked up and down，not knowing what to do．\n By midday I was tired and hungry．I stopped in front of a large house， with clean windows， flowers in the garden， and a dog sitting on the doorstep．\n Suddenly the door opened，and a large， well-dressed， kind-looking man came out．\n ‘What are you doing here， my lad？’ he asked．\n ‘I\u0027m looking for Mr Rankeillor\u0027s house，sir，’I answered．\n ‘ Well， I\u0027m Rankeillor，and this is my house．\n Who are you？’\n ‘My name is David Balfour，’ I replled．\n ‘David Balfour？’ he repeated， and looked closely at me．‘Come inside，Mr Balfour，and we\u0027ll talk．’\n In Mr Rankeillor\u0027s comfortable sitting－room， I told him the story of my early life， and explained that my uncle had paid Captain Hoseason to kidnap me and take me to sea．\n The lawyer listened carefully．‘I heard that Hoseason\u0027s ship went down near the island of Mull two months ago，’ he said．\n ‘What have you been doing since then？’\n ‘I can easily tell you， sir， I replied，‘but if I tell you， a friend\u0027s life may be in danger． Promise me that you will not get him into trouble， or tell the soldiers about him！’\n Although he looked a little worried at first， he promised，and I told him the rest of my adventures While I talked， his eyes were closed and he seemed to be asleep， but I discovered soon afterwards that he had understood and remennbered everything．\n Whem O spoke the name of Alan Breck， he opened his eyes and sat up．‘Don\u0027t use unnecessary names， Mr Balfour， ’ he said．‘A lawyer has to be very careful， when discussing High landers．I don\u0027t think I heard your friend\u0027s name very well．Let\u0027s call him— Mr Thomson．’\n ‘Of course，’ I thought，‘all over Scotland people are talk ing about Alan， now that he\u0027s accused of the murder of Colin Campbell．’ I was sure that Rankeillor had recognized his name． But I just smiled， and continued my story， using the name of Mr Thomson instead of Alan Breck． ‘Well， well，’ said the lawyer， when I had finished，‘ what an exciting adventure！ You will have to write it down one day！ I had heard of you，Mr David，from your friends in Essendean， who wrote to me when they had no word from you． Your uncle then told me that he had given you money to study in Europe， but I did not think that was true． I\u0027m afraid we all know that Ebenezer Balfour is not a very good or honest man！ Then Captain Hoseason appeared， saying that you were lost when his ship went down． But now I understand what really happened， and I know that you are David Balfour．’ He put a hand on my shoulder in a fatherly way and continued．‘You\u0027ll want to know about the house of Shaws．It\u0027s a strange story． When they were young， your father Alexander and his younger brother Ebenezer loved the same girl． Your father was always a kind， loving brother， so when the girl decided to marry him， Alexander left Cramond and let Ebenezer have the house and farmland． Well， I think it was a bad mistake． What happened was that your parents were always very poor，and Ebenezer became more and more interested in money． He never married，of course．’\n ‘Well， sir，’I said，‘ and now， what will happen？’\n ‘Now that your father is dead，’ replied the lawyer，‘you own the house of Shaws and the farms around it． But Ebenezer won\u0027t accept that， and it will be expensive if he wants us to prove it in court．In fact，we must stay out of court，if possible．The kidnapping will be difficult to prove，and we don\u0027t want people asking questions abut your friend Mr Thomson． No， I think that we should leave Ebenezer at Shaws， where he\u0027s been for twenty－five years， and ask him to pay you some money everyyear， instead of giving you the house．What do you think？’\n ‘That sounds excellent to me， sir，’ I replied．‘ But I think that we could accuse my uncle of kidnapping me． It\u0027s easier to prove than you think．Listen，’and I described my plan to him．\n He was very pleased with it．‘Yes， Mr David， very good！If we can catch Ebenezer like that， he can\u0027t refuse to give you some of the money that belongs to you！’ He called to his sec retary， Torrance． ‘You must come with us tonight，Torrance． You\u0027ll have to listen to the conversation you hear，and write it all down． And bring the Balfour papers with you．’ Then he turned to me．‘But if I accept your plan， Mr David， I\u0027ll have to meet your friend Mr Thomson， who may be，I only say may be，a criminal．’He was silent for a while，thinking deeply， then went on，‘Well， let\u0027s talk of something different． Do you know， the other day， I saw Torrance in the street？But because I wasn\u0027t wearing my glasses，I didn\u0027t recognize him！ My own secretary！ Ha－ha－ha！’ and he laughed happily at himself．\n I smiled politely．‘Perhaps he\u0027s getting old，’I thought．\n But later that evening， when Mr Rankeillor， Torrance and I were walking out of Queensferry，the lawyer suddenly cried out， laughing，‘Well， how stupid of me！ I\u0027ve forgotten my glasses！’And I understood why he had told met he story about Torrance． Now he could meet Alan， a man wanted for murder， and if the soldiers asked him later for information he could say that he never saw Alan clearly and could not possibly recognize him．\n When we arrived near Alan\u0027s hiding－place， I whistled the little Highland song． When he appeared， we explained to him what we wanted him to do， and he readily agreed．\n So the four of us continued walking until we reached the house of Shaws．\n It was a dark night， and there were no lights in the windows． My uncle was probably in bed． Mr Rankeillor，Torrance and I hid below the steps， near enough to hear any conversation， while Alan went straight up to the door and knocked loudly． After some time my uncle opened his bedroom window， and called down， in a frightened voice，‘ What do ye want at this time of night？ Who are ye？’\n ‘I do not want to give ye my own name，’ replied Alan，‘but I\u0027ve come to talk to ye about someone called—David．’\n ‘What！’ cried my uncle． And after a moment， he said un happily，‘Will ye come inside， to discuss—the matter？’\n ‘I will not，’ said Alan sharply．‘It\u0027s here on this doorstep that we must talk．\n Come down and speak to me．’\n After Ebenezer had thought about it， he decided to do what Alan wanted． It took him a long time to come downstairs， and a longer time to unlock the heavr door，but at last we saw him in the doorway， holding his gun in his shaking hands．\n ‘ Now，’ said Alan，‘ye\u0027re intelligent enough to see that I\u0027m a Highlander． I have friends who live near the island of Mull．Well， it seems that a ship went down near there， and soon afterwards my friends found a lad， half－dead， on the beach．Your nephew， Mr Balfour． Since then they\u0027ve been taking care of him． And now they\u0027d like to know， Mr Balfour， if ye want him back． Ye\u0027ll have to pay， if ye do． My friends are very poor．\n ‘I don\u0027t want him back，’ said my uncle．‘He wasn\u0027t a good lad． I won\u0027t pay a shilling for him！’\n ‘Blood\u0027s thicker than water， sir，’ said Alan．‘He\u0027s your brother\u0027s son！ But if ye don\u0027t want him back， will ye pay us to keep him？ And ye\u0027ll have to hurry． I\u0027m not waiting here all night！’\n ‘Give me a minute to think， will ye？’ cried my uncle．\n ‘In two words， sir， do ye want us to kill or keep the lad？’\n ‘Oh，sir！’ cried Ebenezer．‘Don\u0027t talk of killing！’\n ‘Well， killing\u0027s easier， and quicker， and cheaper．’\n ‘I\u0027m an honest man，’ said my uncle，‘and no murderer．’\n ‘ Well， well，’ replied Alan，‘ and now how much will ye pay for us to keep him？ First I need to know how much ye paid Hoseason to kidnap the lad．How much was it？’\n ‘Hoseason？ Kidnap？ What are ye talking about， man？’ screamed my uncle， jumping up and down on the doorstep．\n ‘Hoseason himself has told me about it，’ said Alan calmly，‘so ye needn\u0027t pretend．Just answer the question，or ye\u0027ll find my sword in your stomach！’\n ‘Don\u0027t get angry！’ cried my uncle．‘I gave him twenty pounds， that\u0027s all． But to be honest with ye—he was going to sell the lad as a slave， and keep that money，ye see．’\n ‘ Thankyou， Mr Thomson，that\u0027s excellent，’ saidthe lawyer，stepping forward．‘Good evening，Mr Balfour，’\n he said politely to the old man．\n And，‘Good evening， uncle Ebenezer， ’ said I．\n And，‘It\u0027s a grand evening， Mr Balfour，’ added Torrance．\n My uncle said nothing， but stood there on the doorstep with his mouth open． We took him into the kitchen， and sat down to discuss matters． After an hour， it was all decided． My uncle accepted that Shaws belonged to me， but he would stay there during his lifetime． He agreed to pay me money every year，and Mr Rankeillor would check that he did．\n We all stayed that night at the house of Shaws． But while Alan and Torrance and Mr Rankeillor slept on the hard beds upstairs， I lay down on the kitchen chests，which now belonged to me． I， who had slept out on the hills for so many days and nights， was now the owner of a large house and several farms．\n My head was full of exciting plans and ideas，and I found it difficult to sleep．\n The next day， while Mr Rankeillor and I were having breakfast together， I talked to him about Alan．\n ‘Mr Thomson is still in danger，’ said the lawyer．‘He must leave the country as soon as possible， and stay with his friends in France for a while． I\u0027ll give you money to buy him a place on a ship． He\u0027ll have to stay hidden until then．’\n ‘And his clansman， James Stewart， who\u0027s in prison？’ I asked．‘I know he didn\u0027t kill Colin Campbell． I saw the mur derer！ I must speak for James Stewart in court！’\n ‘My dear boy，’ said Rankeillor，‘it\u0027s dangerous for anyone to speak for a Stewart in Campbell court． But you must do what you think is right． I\u0027ll write you a letter to a good lawyer who will be able to help Mr Thomson\u0027s clansman．’ He stood up．‘Well， I think that we\u0027ve finished our business here． I must leave now，and go back to my work．\n Come and see me often， Mr David！ Goodbye！’\n Alan and I started walking towards Edlnburgh，while Mr Rankeillor and Torrance turned back to Queensferry． we talked about what would happen next． Alan was going to hide in the countryside near Edinburgh， until it was safe for him to take a ship to France．\n When I had found him a place，I would send him a message． Then I planned to go back to the High lands to help James Stewart return to his family．\n Alan and I walked slowly． We were both thinking that soon we would have to leave each other． And we had been through so much together！We stopped when we came to the top of the Corstorphine Hill， and looked down at Edinburgh． We knew that this was the moment to say goodbye， but we stood there silently for a while．\n ‘Well， goodbye，’ said Alan， and held out his hand．\n ‘ Goodbye，’I said， and took his hand．\n Then I went off down hill．I did not look back at him，but I felt very miserable， and wanted to sit down and cry like a baby．\n Edinburgh was full of noise and traffic and people， but I did not notice any of that． All the time I was thinking of Alan on the hill， and there was an ice-cold feeling inside me．\n In the months that followed， I kept Alan\u0027s silver button safe and often looked at it， remembering our escape through the heather in the wild Highlands． I felt proud to call Alan Breck Stewart my friend， and wondered if I would ever see him again．When I returned to the Highlands to help his clansman， James，I found that my adventures with the Stewarts were far from finished… but that is another story．\n 5 戴维回了家\n \n 我们决定，艾伦藏在田野里而我则步行到昆斯费里去找兰基勒先生。艾伦答应他直到听到我回来才出来。为了确认是我，他教我吹一首盖尔语小曲。我从来没有忘记它。我想这首歌会在我弥留之际时索绕在我脑中。每当我想起这首歌，我就想到我们一起旅行的最后一天：在草丛中，艾伦躺在我对面吹着口哨，早晨的第一缕阳光抚摸着他的脸。\n 我很快就到了昆斯费里。当我看到人们奇怪地看着我时，我意识到我的衣服有多么脏，我开始害怕了。兰基勒先生想和我说话吗？我怎样证明我自己？我随身没带任何证明文件。我太羞愧了，以至于不敢向任何市民求助，于是我走来走去，不知道该做什么。\n 到了正午我又累又饿。我在一座大房子前停住了，那房子窗户洁净，园子里有花，门阶上一条狗卧立着。门突然间开了，一个身材高大、穿着考究、和蔼可亲的人走了出来。\n “小伙子，你在这儿干嘛？”他问道。\n “我在找兰基勒先生的家，先生。”我答道。\n “唔，我就是兰基勒，而且这就是我的家。你是谁？”\n “我叫戴维·鲍尔弗。”\n “戴维·鲍尔弗？”他重复着，细盯着我。“进来，鲍尔弗先生，我们谈一谈。”\n 在兰基勒先生舒适的客厅里，我给他讲述了我早年的故事，告诉他我的叔叔买通霍齐亚森船长诱拐了我并把我带到了海上。\n 律师认真地听着。“我听说霍齐亚森的船两个月前在马尔岛附近沉了。”他说道，“你从那以后一直在干什么？”\n “告诉你很容易，先生，”我答道，“但如果告诉你，一位朋友的生命将受到威胁。答应我你不要使他陷入麻烦或向士兵告发他！”\n 虽然起初他看起来有点担心，但他答应了，我告诉他我其余的冒险经历。我讲时，他闭着眼，看起来像睡着了，但之后不久我发现他明白了并记住了所有事情。\n 当我提到艾伦·布雷克这个名字时，他睁开了眼并坐正了。“不要用不必要的名字，鲍尔弗先生。”他说道，“律师在讨论苏格兰高地人时得非常小心。我认为我没太听清你朋友的名字。就让我们称他——汤姆森先生吧。”\n “当然，”我想，“全苏格兰的人都在谈论艾伦，既然他被指控谋杀了科林·坎贝尔的话。”我确信兰基勒已认出了他的名字。但我只是微微一笑，继续讲我的故事，用汤姆森先生这个名字代替艾伦·布雷克。\n “唔，唔，”我讲完以后律师说道，“多惊险的经历啊！你真应该有朝一日把它写下来！我曾经从你在埃森丁的朋友那里听说过你，戴维先生，他们在没有你的消息时曾经写信给我。当时你的叔叔告诉我说他已经给你钱让你在欧洲学习，但我当时就想那不是真的。我想我们都知道埃比尼泽·鲍尔弗先生并不是一个好人或老实人！后来霍齐亚森船长出现了，说他的船下沉时你就不见了。但现在我知道真的发生了什么事。我知道你就是戴维·鲍尔弗。”他慈父般地把手放在我的肩上并继续说：“你可能想知道肖家大院的有关情况。是一个奇特的故事。你父亲亚历山大和他的弟弟埃比尼泽年轻时爱上了同一个女孩。你父亲一直是一个友善的、讨人喜欢的兄弟，所以那个女孩决定嫁给他时他便离开了克莱蒙德并把房子和农田留给了埃比尼泽。唔，我想这是一个大错。所发生的事情是，你的父母一直很穷，而埃比尼泽越来越对金钱感兴趣。他从未结婚，当然了。”\n “那么，先生，”我说，“现在又会怎么样呢？”\n “既然你的父亲去世了，”律师回答说，“你就拥有肖家大院和周围的农场。但埃比尼泽不会接受，如果他要我们在法庭上证明这一点那将花销很大。事实上我们必须尽可能不去法庭。这次诱拐很难证明，我们也不愿意让别人问一些关于你朋友汤姆森的问题。对，我想我们应该让埃比尼泽留在肖家大院，他在那儿已经待了25年了。而且我们可以要求他每年给你一些钱而不是要他把房子还你。你认为怎么样？”\n “那样听起来很棒，先生。”我回答，“但我想我们可以控告我叔叔诱拐了我。证明起来比你想像得容易。听着，”我然后向他描述了我的计划。\n 他对此很高兴。“是，戴维先生，很好！如果我们能那样套住埃比尼泽的话，他不可能拒绝把本属于你的一些钱还给你！”他大叫他的秘书托伦斯：“你必须今晚和我们一起来，托伦斯。你必须认真听你听到的，并将其记录下来。并且带来与鲍尔弗家族有关的文件。”接着他转身对我说：“但是如果我接受了你的计划，戴维先生，我必须见一下你的朋友汤姆森先生。他可能是，我只是说可能是，一个罪犯。”他沉默了一会儿，沉思着，然后接着说；“好了，让我们聊一下别的什么事情。你知道吗？前几天我在街上看见了托伦斯，但因为当时我没带眼镜，我没有认出他来！我自己的秘书！哈哈哈！”他还自嘲地开怀大笑。\n 我礼貌地微微一笑。“可能他变老了，”我想。\n 但这之后那天晚上，我、兰基勒先生和托伦斯走出昆斯费里后，兰基勒这位律师突然笑着叫道：“唉，我多思蠢！我忘了我的眼镜！”于是我明白了他为什么给我讲托伦斯的故事。他现在可以见到正被人通缉捉拿的艾伦了，一旦士兵日后问他有关情况，他会讲他从未看清艾伦，也不可能认出他。\n 当我们靠近艾伦隐蔽的地方时，我用口哨吹起了那首高地小曲。艾伦出来以后，我们对他解释想让他做什么，他欣然同意了。于是我们四个人继续前行，直到到了肖家大院。\n 那天晚上很黑，窗户也没透出亮光。我叔叔可能上床睡觉了。我、兰基勒先生还有托伦斯藏在台阶下边，离房子近得都可以听清任何谈话，而艾伦径直走向房门并大声敲了起来。过了一会儿之后我叔叔打开了他卧室的窗户，用惊恐的声音对下面叫道；“晚上这个时候你想干什么？你是谁？”\n “我不想告诉你我自己的名字，”艾伦回答说，“但我来是想和你谈一下一个人——一个叫戴维的人的事情。”\n “什么？！”我叔叔大叫起来。过了一会儿他不快地说：“你能进来以便谈一下——这事吗？”\n “我不行，”艾伦机警地说，“我们得在门阶这儿说。下来对我说。”\n 埃比尼泽考虑了之后，决定做艾伦想要他做的事。他花了很长时间才到楼下，花了更长的时间才打开沉重的大门，但我们终于看到他站在门口，用他发抖的手握着枪。\n “现在，”艾伦说道，“你肯定已经看出来了我是一个高地人。我有几个朋友住在马尔岛附近。唔，似乎是有一条船在那儿附近沉没了，之后不久我的朋友们在沙滩上发现了一个奄奄一息的小伙子。是你的侄子，鲍尔弗先生。自那之后，他们一直在照顾他。现在他们想知道，鲍尔弗先生，你是否想让他回来。如果你同意，你必须付钱。我的朋友们很穷。”\n “我不想让他回来。”我叔叔说，“他那时就不是一个好小伙子。我不会为他付一个先令！”\n “血浓于水，先生。”艾伦说，“他是你兄弟的儿子！但是如果你不让他回来，你愿意付我们钱以抚养他吗？而且你必须快一点儿。我不可能在这儿等你一晚上！”\n “给我一分钟让我想一想，行不行？”我叔叔叫着。\n “两个字，先生，你是让我们杀他还是留他？”\n “噢，先生！”埃比尼泽叫道，“不要谈杀！”\n “唔，相比之下，杀是较简单、快捷又省钱的办法。”\n “我是一个诚实的人，”我叔叔说，“而且不是一个杀人犯。”\n “好了，好了，”艾伦说，“你现在愿意付多少钱给我们去抚养他？首先我想知道你付了多少钱给霍齐亚森让他去诱拐这个小伙子。是多少？”\n “霍齐亚森？诱拐？你在说什么，伙计？”我叔叔尖叫着，气得在门阶那儿上下乱跳。\n “霍齐亚森本人已告诉我这件事，”艾伦镇静地说着，“所以你不用装了。只回答问题，不然你会发现我的剑将刺入你的肚子！”\n “别生气，”我叔叔喊着，“我给他20镑，就那么多。但老实和你说——他想把这小伙子当奴隶卖掉，并且独吞那笔钱，你知道。”\n “谢谢你，汤姆森先生，那太好了。”律师走上前说。“晚上好，鲍尔弗先生，”他礼貌地对这个老人说。\n 还有，“晚上好，埃比尼泽叔叔，”我说。\n 还有，“这真是一个重要的夜晚，鲍尔弗先生，”托伦斯补充道。\n 我叔叔什么也没说，但张嘴站在台阶上。我们带他进了厨房，坐下来商量事情。一个小时后，一切都定下来了。我叔叔同意肖家大院归我所有，但他要待在那儿度过余生。他同意每年付给我钱，而且兰基勒先生将监督他的行为。\n 那天晚上我们整夜都待在肖家大院。但当艾伦、托伦斯和兰基勒先生躺在楼上的硬床上睡觉时，我躺在厨房的柜子上，那些现在属于我了。这么多个日日夜夜我一直在山上露天躺着，而现在成了一幢大房子和几个农场的主人。我脑子里满是令人兴奋的计划和念头，我发现自己难以入睡。\n 第二天，当我和兰基勒先生一起用早餐时，我和他说起了艾伦。\n “汤姆森先生仍然有危险。”律师说，“他必须尽快离开这个国家，和他在法国的朋友待一段时间。我将给你钱以便给他在船上买个舱位。在此之前他必须一直藏匿着。”\n “还有他的同族人，詹姆斯·斯图尔特，即还在监狱里的那位呢？”我问。“我知道他并没有杀害科林·坎贝尔。我看到了谋杀犯！我肯定会在法庭上为詹姆斯·斯图尔特说话的！”\n “我亲爱的孩子，”兰基勒说，“每一个在坎贝尔族人的法庭上为斯图尔特人说话的人都会有危险的。但你应该做你认为对的事。我将为你给一个能帮助汤姆森先生的同族人的好律师写封信。”他站起来。“唔，我想我们在这儿的事已经结束了。我现在必须离开，回去做我的工作。常来看我吧，戴维先生！再见！”\n 我和艾伦开始向爱丁堡走去，而兰基勒先生和托伦斯则折回昆斯费里。我们讨论接下来怎么办。艾伦将躲在爱丁堡城附近的乡下，直到他坐船去法国脱离危险为止。我为他在船上找到了地方时，我将给他送个信。然后我计划回到高地帮助詹姆斯·斯图尔特回到自己的家。\n 我和艾伦慢慢地走着。我们都想着不久后我们将各自离去。而且我们曾经在一起经历这么多事情！我们走到科西托芬小山的山顶的时候停了下来，俯瞰着爱丁堡。我们知道已经到了说再见的时候了，但我们在那儿静静地站了片刻。\n “好了，再见，”艾伦说着，并伸出了他的手。\n “再见，”我说，并握住了他的手。然后我下山去。我没有回头看他，但我感到很难受，并想坐在地上像小孩子一样大哭一场。\n 爱丁堡声音嘈杂，车水马龙，人群熙攘，但我一点儿没有注意到那些。我一直想小山上的艾伦，心里感到冰冷。\n 之后的岁月里，我一直珍藏着艾伦的银扣，并且经常拿出来看一看，回忆着我们一起在荒凉的高地石南丛中逃跑的事。我为能把艾伦·布雷克·斯图尔特当自己的朋友而自豪，我不知道我能否还能再见到他。当我回到高地去帮助他的族人詹姆斯时，我发现我和斯图尔特人在一起的历险还远未结束……但那是另外一个故事了。\n \n
