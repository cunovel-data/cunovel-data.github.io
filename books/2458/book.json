Joined by Police Chief Brian Irons and all of Raccoon\u0027s Council members, Harris assured the gathered citizens and reporters that Raccoon City will once again be a safe community in which to live and work, and that the investigation into the eleven \"cannibal\" murders and three fatal wild-animal attacks is far from closed.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/city-of-the-dead-resident-evil-3.jpg","author":"S.D.
