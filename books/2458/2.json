It wasn\u0027t easy; the house had been tossed since the last time she\u0027d been there, the floors were strewn with books and papers, and it was too dark to navigate around the debris easily. That her small home had been violated was upsetting, though not much of a surprise. She figured she should just be thankful that she wasn\u0027t really the sentimental type - and that the intruders hadn\u0027t managed to find her passport. She grabbed random handfuls of clean socks and underwear in the cramped darkness of the bedroom and stuffed them deep into her weathered backpack, wishing she could turn on the lights. Packing a bag in the dark was harder than it sounded, would be even if one\u0027s house hadn\u0027t been trashed; but she knew they couldn\u0027t afford to take any chances. It was unlikely that Umbrella still had all of their houses staked out, but if there was anyone watching, a light in the window could draw fire.\n At least you\u0027re getting out. No more hiding.\n There was that much. They were headed for foreign soil, to storm enemy headquarters and very likely get killed in the process, but at least she wouldn\u0027t have to hang out in Raccoon anymore. And from what she\u0027d read in the papers lately, maybe that was for the best. Two attacks in the last week... Chris and Barry were skeptical about the danger, even knowing what the T-Virus did to people - Barry thought it was some kind of a PR stunt, that Umbrella would \"rescue\" Raccoon before anyone got hurt. Chris agreed, insisting that Umbrella wouldn\u0027t crap in their own back yard, so to speak, what with the Spencer estate disaster so recent. But Jill wasn\u0027t prepared to assume anything; Umbrel- la had already proven that they couldn\u0027t contain their research. And with what Rebecca and David Trapp\u0027s team had faced in Maine... Now wasn\u0027t the time to think about that - they had a plane to catch. Jill scooped the flashlight off the dresser and was about to head for the living room when she remembered that she only had one bra with her. Scowling, she turned back to the open drawers and started to dig. She had enough clothing already, chosen from what Brad had left behind when he\u0027d fled Raccoon; she and the guys had been holed up in his vacant house for several weeks, ever since Umbrella had hit Barry\u0027s house, and although none of Brad\u0027s stuff fit Chris\u0027s tall frame or Barry\u0027s massive one, she\u0027d been able to make do. Lingerie, however, wasn\u0027t something the S.T.A.R.S. pilot had stocked up on. She didn\u0027t particularly want to hop off the plane in Austria and have to go bra shopping. \"Vanity, thy name is underwire,\" she muttered softly, pawing through the rumpled heap. She found the elusive article only after she\u0027d gone through the drawer twice, and crammed it into the bag as she jogged toward the small front room of the rented house. It was only the second time she\u0027d been there since they\u0027d gone into hiding; she had the feeling she might not be coming back for a while. There was a picture of her father on one of the bookshelves that she wanted to take. Stepping nimbly through the dark clutter, she hooded the flashlight with one hand and trained the narrow beam at the corner where the shelf had been. The Umbrella team had knocked the whole thing over but apparently hadn\u0027t bothered to go through the books themselves. God only knew what they\u0027d been looking for in the first place. Clues as to where the renegade S.T.A.R.S. were hiding, probably; after the attack at Barry\u0027s house and the disastrous mission at Caliban Cove, she no longer had any illusions about Umbrella simply ignoring them. Jill spotted the book she wanted, a rather lurid-looking paperback entitled Prison Life; her father would have laughed. She picked it up and rifled through the pages, stopping when the light fell across Dick Valentine\u0027s crooked grin. He\u0027d sent the picture along with one of his more recent letters, and she\u0027d tucked it into the book so that she wouldn\u0027t lose it. Hiding important things was a habit she\u0027d gotten into young, one that had just paid off yet again. She let the book drop, the need to hurry suddenly forgotten as she gazed down at the photo. A faint smile played across her lips. He was probably the only man she knew of who looked good in the bright orange jumpsuit of a maximum security pen. For just a moment, she wondered what he\u0027d think of her current predicament; in a roundabout way, he was responsible, at least for her getting involved with the\n S.T.A.R.S. in the first place. After he\u0027d been sent up, he\u0027d urged her to get out of the business, even saying that he\u0027d been wrong to train her as a thief...\n ... so I take a legit job, actually working for society instead of against it and people in Raccoon start dying. The S.T.A.R.S. uncover a conspiracy to create bioweapons with a virus that turns living things into monsters. Obviously nobody believes us, the S. T.A.R.S. that can\u0027t be bought by Umbrella are either discredited or eliminated. So we go underground, try to dig up proof and come up empty-handed as Umbrella contin-ues to screw around with their dangerous research and more good people are killed. Now we\u0027re off on what will probably be a suicide mission to Europe to see if we can infiltrate the headquarters of a multibillion-dollar cor-poration and stop them from destroying the goddamn planet. What would you think, I wonder? Assuming you\u0027d even believe such a fantastic tale, what would you think? \"You\u0027d be proud of me, Dick,\" she whispered, scarcely aware that she\u0027d spoken aloud and not at all sure if it was the truth. Her father wanted to see her in a less perilous line of work, and compared to what she and the other ex-S.T.A.R.S. were currently up against, burglary was about as dangerous as ac- counting. After a long moment, she carefully placed the photo into a pocket of the backpack and looked around at the broken remnants of her small home, still thinking about her father and what he\u0027d say about the strange path her life had taken; if things went well, maybe she\u0027d be able to ask him in person. Rebecca Chambers and the other survivors of the Maine mission were still in hiding, quietly networking through the\n S.T.A.R.S. organization for support and waiting to hear what she and Chris and Barry could tell them about Umbrella\u0027s headquarters. The official HQ was in Austria, although they all suspected that the minds behind the T-Virus had their own secret complex elsewhere - which you won\u0027t find out if you don\u0027t get your ass in gear; the guys are gonna think you stopped to take a nap. Jill shouldered the bag and took a final look around the room before moving toward the back door, through the kitchen. There was a lingering scent of rotten fruit in the dark air, coming from a bowl of apples and pears on top of the refrigerator that had long since disintegrated into mush. Even though she knew better, the smell caused a chill to run up her spine; she hurried for the closed door, trying to block out the sudden vivid flashes of memory of what they\u0027d found at the Spencer estate...\n ... rotting as they walked, reaching out with wet and withered fingers, faces melting with pus and de- cay -\n \"Jill?\"\n She barely contained a cry of surprise at the sound of Chris\u0027s soft voice just outside. The door opened, Chris silhouetted against the darkness by a distant streetlight. \"Yeah, right here,\" she said, stepping forward. \"Sorry it took me so long. Umbrella\u0027s been through here with a bulldozer.\"\n Even in the bare light she could see the half grin on his boyish face. \"We were starting to think the zom-bies got ya,\" he said, and although his tone was light, she could hear real concern beneath it. Jill knew that he was trying to ease the tension but couldn\u0027t find it in herself to smile back. Too manypeople had died because of what Umbrella had un- leashed in the woods outside of town; if the spill had happened closer to Raccoon... \"Not funny,\" she said softly. Chris\u0027s grin faded. \"I know. You ready?\"Jill nodded, although she didn\u0027t feel particularlyready for what lay ahead. Then again, she hadn\u0027t felt ready for what they were leaving behind, either. In a matter of weeks, her concept of reality had undergone a massive shift, turning nightmares into the common- place.\n Evil corporations, mad scientists, killer viruses. And the walking dead... \"Yeah,\" she said finally. \"I\u0027m ready.\"Together, they stepped outside. As Jill closed the door behind them, she was suddenly struck by a strange and ominous certainty that she would never set foot in the house again, that the three of themwouldn\u0027t be coming back to Raccoon City at all...\n ... but not because anything happens to us. Some-thing will happen, but not to us.\n Frowning, hand on the doorknob, she hesitated for a moment and tried to make sense of the bizarre thought. If they survived the recon, if they were successful in their fight against Umbrella, why wouldn\u0027t they come back to their homes? She didn\u0027t know, but the feeling was uncomfortably strong. Something bad was going to happen, something...\n \"Hey, you okay?\"\n Jill looked up at Chris, saw the same concern on his youthful face that she\u0027d noticed earlier. They\u0027d gotten pretty close in the last few weeks, although she suspected that Chris might like to get a bit closer.\n Oh, and you don\u0027t?\n The sense of impending unpleasantness was alreadyfading, other confusions and uncertainties stepping in to take its place. Jill shook herself mentally and nodded at Chris, letting the feelings go. The flight to New York wasn\u0027t going to wait for her to indulge in self-analysis... or to worry about things that she couldn\u0027t control, imagined or otherwise.\n Still, that feeling... \"Let\u0027s get the hell out of here,\" she said, and meant it. They moved out into the night, leaving the house dark behind them, as lonely and silent as a tomb. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/city-of-the-dead-resident-evil-3/page-2.html","bookId":2458,"book":{"id":2458,"title":"City Of The Dead (Resident Evil #3)","description":"Storyline: \n On the front steps of City Hall, Mayor Harris announced in a press conference yesterday afternoon that the City Council will be hiring at least ten new police officers to join the Raccoon police, in response to the continued suspension of the Special Tactics and Rescue Squad (S.T.A.R.S.), in effect since the brutal murders that plagued Raccoon earlier this summer.
