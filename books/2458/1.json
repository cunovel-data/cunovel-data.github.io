{"id":80876,"no":1,"title":"Page 1","content":"Raccoon Times, August 26, 1998\\n\\n MAYOR ANNOUNCES \u0027KEEP CITY SAFE\u0027 PLAN RACCOON CITY\\n\\n -On the front steps of City Hall, Mayor Harris announced in a press conference yesterday afternoon that the City Council will be hiring at least ten new police officers to join the Raccoon police, in response to the continued suspension of the Special Tactics and Rescue Squad (S.T.A.R.S.), in effect since the brutal murders that plagued Raccoon earlier this summer. Joined by Police Chief Brian Irons and all of Raccoon\u0027s Council members, Harris assured the gathered citizens and reporters that Raccoon City will once again be a safe community in which to live and work, and that the investigation into the eleven \"cannibal\" murders and three fatal wild-animal attacks is far from closed.\\n\\n \"Just because no one else has been attacked in the last month doesn\u0027t mean that the elected officials of this city can relax,\" Harris stated. \"The good people of Raccoon deserve to have confidence in their police force and to be secure in the knowledge that their political representatives are doing everything possible to ensure each citizen\u0027s safety. As many of you know, the S.T.A.R.S.\u0027s suspension is likely to become permanent. That unit\u0027s gross mishandling of the murder investigations and its subsequent disappearance from Raccoon City suggests that they don\u0027t care about this community - but I want to assure you that we care, that myself, Chief Irons, and the men and women you see here today want nothing more than to make Raccoon a place in which our children can grow up without fear.\"\\n\\n Harris went on to detail a three-point plan designed to bolster public confidence and keep Raccoon citizens from falling victim to violence. Besides hiring between ten and twelve new police officers, the citywide curfew will remain in place through at least September, and Chief Irons will personally head a task force of several officers and detectives to continue searching for the killers who took the lives of eleven people between May and July of this year...\\n\\n Cityside, September 4,1998\\n\\n RENOVATION OP UMBRELLA COMPLEX PLANNED RACCOON CITY\\n\\n The Umbrella chemical plant just south of downtown Raccoon is due for major construction efforts, slated to begin next Monday. This will be the third such structural renovation in the last year for the thriving pharmaceutical company. According to Umbrella spokesperson Amanda Whitney, two of the laboratories inside the main plant will be fitted with several million dollars\u0027 worth of new equipment designed for vaccine synthesis, and the building itself will receive a state-of- the-art security system. In addition, all of the connected office buildings will be upgrading computers over the next several weeks. But will this be a problem for downtown traffic? Said Whitney, \"With the Raccoon police building just finishing up yet another one of their renovations, we know that local commuters are getting pretty tired of blocked streets. We\u0027re going to do our best not to get in the way of downtown traffic; most of the construction is internal, and the rest we\u0027ll be doing after business hours.\" The courtyard in front of the RPD building, our readers may remember, was recently repaved and landscaped after several mysterious cracks appeared in the cement and topsoil; traffic had to be diverted around two blocks of Oak Street for six days. When asked why so many \"overhauls\" as of late, Whitney replied, \"Umbrella has stayed ahead of the competition for as long as it has by keeping up with current technology. It\u0027s going to be a busy couple of months, but I think it will be well worth the effort when we\u0027re finally through...\"\\n\\n Raccoon Weekly Editorial, September 17, 1998\\n\\n IRONS TO RUN? RACCOON CITY\\n\\n Mayor Harris may be in for a rough race next spring. Weekly sources inside the RPD are saying that Brian Irons, chief of police for the last four-and-a-half years, may be running for the city\u0027s top office in the next election, facing off against the popular and as yet unopposed Devlin Harris, already in office for three consecutive terms. Although Irons would not confirm his possible entry into the political arena, the onetime S.T.A.R.S. member also refused to deny the rumor. With his approval rating at an all-time high ever since the cessation of this summer\u0027s savage murders (as yet unsolved) and the planned expansion of the RPD, Chief Irons may indeed be the man to knock Harris out of City Hall; the question is, will voters be able to forget Irons\u0027s alleged involvement in the 1994 Cider District land scam? Or his rather expensive tastes In art and interior design, which have turned parts of the RPD building into something more like a museum than a working office? Assuming he means to throw his hat into the ring, this reporter - for one - will be looking forward to examining Irons\u0027s financial records...\\n\\n Baocoan Times, September 22,1998\\n\\n TEENAGER ATTACKED IN CITY PARK RACCOON CITY\\n\\n At, approximately 6:30 P.M. last night, fourteen- year-old Shanna Williamson was accosted by a mysterious stranger in downtown\u0027s Birch Street Park on the way home from softball practice. The man came out from behind a row of hedges at the south end of the park and knocked Ms. Williamson off of her bicycle before attempting to grab her. The teen managed to get away with onty a few scratches, running to the nearby residence of Tom and Clara Atkins; Mrs. Atkins alerted the authorities, who conducted a thorough search of the park but found no sign of the attacker. According to the girl (through a police statement issued earlier this morning), the man appeared to be a transient; his clothes and hair were dirty, and she described a bad odor coming from him, a \"smell like rotten fruit.\" She also said that he seemed drunk, staggering and falling after her as she ran. With the plague of cannibalistic murders from May to July still unsolved, the RPD is taking Ms. Williamson\u0027s encounter very seriously; the assailant bears a striking resemblance to eyewitness reports of the \"gang\" members spotted in Victory Park last June. Mayor Harris has called a press conference for later today, and Mice Chief Brian Irons has stated already that with the first of the newly hired police officers expected next week, regular patrols will extend their routes to include the downtown park blocks... \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/city-of-the-dead-resident-evil-3/page-1.html","bookId":2458,"book":{"id":2458,"title":"City Of The Dead (Resident Evil #3)","description":"Storyline: On the front steps of City Hall, Mayor Harris announced in a press conference yesterday afternoon that the City Council will be hiring at least ten new police officers to join the Raccoon police, in response to the continued suspension of the Special Tactics and Rescue Squad (S.T.A.R.S.), in effect since the brutal murders that plagued Raccoon earlier this summer.
