{"id":80879,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"Leon reached the outskirts of town with twenty minutes to spare, but decided that a hot dinner was going to have to wait. From his previous visits to the station, he knew that there were a couple of vending machines he could hit up for something to tide him over. The thought of stale candy and peanuts didn\u0027t sit well on his growling stomach, but it was his own damned fault for not taking New York traffic into account. The drive into the city proper did a lot to soothe his still rattled nerves; he passed the few small farms that lay east of town, the fairgrounds and storage sheds, and finally the truck stop that marked the separation of rural Raccoon from urban. Something about know- ing that he was going to be patrolling those back roads before long, keeping them safe, gave him a surprising sense of well-being and not a little pride. The early autumn air from the open window was pleasantly brisk, and the rising moon bathed everything he saw in a silvery glow. He wasn\u0027t going to be late after all; within the hour, he\u0027d officially become one of Rac- coon\u0027s finest. As Leon turned the Jeep down Bybee, heading for one of the main north-south streets that would take him to the RPD building, he got his first hint that something was very wrong. In the first few blocks, he was mildly surprised; by the fifth, he found himself slipping toward a state of shock. It wasn\u0027t just strange, it was... well, it was impossible. Bybee was the first real city street, coming from the east, where buildings outnumbered empty lots. There were several espresso bars and cheap diners, as well as a bargain movie theater that never seemed to run anything but horror movies and sexy comedies - and was therefore the most popular hangout for the youth of Raccoon. There were even a few generically hip taverns that served microbrew and hot rum drinks for the winter college-student ski crowd. At quarter to nine on a Saturday night, Bybee should have been teeming with life.\\n\\n But of the mostly single or two-story brick shops and restaurants that lined the street, Leon saw that almost all were dark and in the few that still boasted some light, it didn\u0027t look like there was anyone inside. There were plenty of cars parked along the narrow street, and yet not one person that he could see; Bybee, the hangout for cruising teens and college students, was totally deserted.\\n\\n Where the hell is everybody?\\n\\n His mind grasped for answers as he crept down the silent street, searching desperately for a reason - and for some way to alleviate the sweaty anxiety that had once again settled over him. Maybe there was some kind of an event going on, a church function, like a spaghetti feed. Or perhaps Raccoon had decided to take up Oktoberfest and tonight was the big kickoff.\\n\\n Yeah, but everybody at the same time? It\u0027d have to be one hell of a party.\\n\\n It was then that Leon realized he also hadn\u0027t seen a single car on the road since he\u0027d had the scare with the dog ten miles out of town. Not one. And with that thoroughly unsettling realization came the next - less dramatic, but distinctly more immediate. Something smelled bad. In fact, something smelled like shit.\\n\\n Jeez, dead skunk. And apparently it threw up on itself before dying.\\n\\n He\u0027d already slowed the Jeep to a crawl and had planned to take a left on Powell, just a block ahead, but that horrible smell and the total absence of life were giving him a serious case of the creeps. Maybe he should stop and check things out, look around for some sign of life.\\n\\n \"Oh, hey!\"\\n\\n Leon grinned, relief flooding through his confusion. There were a couple of people standing at the corner, practically right in front of him; the streetlight was out on their side, but he could see them in silhouette clear enough - a couple, a woman in a skirt and a big man wearing work boots. As he got closer he could see by the way they moved, heading south on Powell, that they had to be monumentally drunk. Both of them staggered into the shadows cast by an office supply store and out of sight; but he was going in that direction anyway - no harm in stopping to ask what was going on, was there? Must\u0027ve come out of O\u0027Kelly\u0027s. A pint or two too many, but as long as they\u0027re not driving anywhere, fine by me. Am I going to feel stupid when they tell me that tonight\u0027s the big free concert or the all-you-can-eat town barbecue...\\n\\n Almost giddy with relief, Leon turned the corner and squinted into the heavy shadows, looking for the pair. He didn\u0027t see them, but there was an alley tucked between the supply store and a jewelry shop. Maybe his two drunk friends had ducked in for a bathroom break or something even less legal...\\n\\n \"Shit!\"\\n\\n Leon slammed on the brake as a half-dozen dark shapes fluttered up from the street, caught in the Jeep\u0027s headlights like giant whirling leaves. Startled, it took him a second to realize he was seeing birds; they didn\u0027t cry out, although he was close enough to hear the brushing of dry wings as they took to the air. Crows, enjoying a late night feast of roadkill, what looked like...\\n\\n Oh, my God.\\n\\n There was a human body in the middle of the road, twenty feet in front of the Jeep. Face down, but it looked like a woman and judging from the liquid red stains that covered most of the once-white blouse, it wasn\u0027t some beer-happy college student who\u0027d decided to take a nap in the wrong place.\\n\\n Hit-and-run. Some bastard hit her and then drove away, Jesus what a mess...\\n\\n Leon killed the engine and was half out the door before his racing thoughts caught him up. He hesi- tated, one foot on the asphalt, the stench of death heavy in the cool still air. His mind had latched on to an idea that he didn\u0027t want to consider, but knew he had better; this wasn\u0027t some training exercise, this was his life.\\n\\n What if it\u0027s not a hit-and-run? What if there\u0027s no one around because some psycho gunman decided on a little target practice? Everyone could be inside, laying low - maybe the RPD\u0027s on the way, and maybe those drunks weren \u0027t drunk, they could\u0027ve been shot and were trying to get help...\\n\\n He leaned back into the Jeep and fumbled under the passenger seat for his graduation gift, a Desert Eagle.50AE Magnum with a custom ten-inch barrel, Israeli export. His father and uncle - both cops - had gone in together on it. Not standard issue for the RPD, in fact much more powerful; as Leon grabbed a clip from the glovebox and slapped it in, feeling the solid weight of the weapon in his slightly unsteady hands, he decided it was the best present he\u0027d ever received. He stuffed two more clips into a belt pouch on general principle; each only held six rounds. Pointing the loaded Magnum at the ground, he stepped out of the Jeep and took a quick look at his surroundings. He wasn\u0027t all that familiar with Rac- coon at night, but he knew that it shouldn\u0027t be as dark as it was. Several of the streetlights farther along Powell were either shot out or simply not on, and the shadows past the blood-soaked body were thick; if not for the Jeep\u0027s headlights, he wouldn\u0027t have even been able to see that. He edged forward, feeling horribly exposed as he left the relative cover of the Jeep, but aware that she could still be alive; it didn\u0027t seem likely, but he had to at least check. A few steps closer, and he could see that it was definitely a young woman. Lank red hair obscured the face, but the clothes were right, denim pedal-pushers and flats. The wounds were mostly hidden by the bloody shirt, but there seemed to be dozens - ragged holes in the wet cloth exposed torn, glistening flesh and the crimson of muscle beneath. Swallowing heavily, Leon quickly switched the gun to his left hand and crouched down next to her. The cool, clammy skin yielded easily beneath his finger- tips as he touched her throat, pressing his first two fingers against the carotid. A few seconds passed, seconds that made him feel horribly young and afraid as he tried to remember the procedure for CPR and prayed, at the same time, that he would feel a pulse.\\n\\n Five compressions, two short breaths, keep my el-bows locked and come on please don\u0027t be dead...\\n\\n He couldn\u0027t find it, and didn\u0027t want to wait one more second. He tucked the Magnum into his belt and grabbed her shoulders to turn her over, to check for breathing, but as he started to lift, he saw some- thing that made him lay her down again, his heart a twisting knot in his chest. The victim\u0027s shirt had pulled out of her pants enough for him to see that her spine and part of her ribcage were exposed, the still-fleshy knobs of verte- brae shining and red, the narrow, curving ribs disap-pearing into masses of shredded tissue. It was like she\u0027d been knocked down and... chewed on. Infor- mation that Leon had disregarded as unimportant suddenly registered, and even as the few facts he had clicked into place, he felt the first inky tendrils of real fear slither into his mind.\\n\\n The crows couldn\u0027t have done this, would\u0027ve taken them hours, and who the hell ever heard of crows flocking after dark to eat? And that shit-smell, it\u0027s not coming from her, she died recently, and... Cannibal. Murders. No. No way. For that to happen, for a person to have been killed and then partially-devoured on a city street with no one to stop it... and with enough time to pass for scavengers to come - for that to happen, the killers would have had to slaughter most if not all of the population. Doesn\u0027t seem likely? Fine. Then what\u0027s that smell? And where is everyone?\\n\\n Behind Leon, there was a low, soft groan. A shuf-fling footstep, and another sound. A wet sound. It took him barely a second to stand and turn, hand instinctively snatching for the Magnum. It was the couple, the drunks, staggering toward him, and they\u0027d been joined by a third, a beefy-looking guy with... with blood all over his shirt and his hands. And dripping out of his mouth, a rubbery red mouth set into his pasty, rotting face like an open sore. The other man, the big man with the work boots and suspenders, looked much the same and the vee of the blond woman\u0027s pink blouse revealed cleavage that was spotted with darkness, with what appeared to be mold. The trio stumbled toward him, past his Jeep, rais- ing pale hands as they emitted moaning, hungry wails. Some dark fluid gurgled out of the beefy man\u0027s nose and ran across his moving lips, and Leon was over- whelmed by the understanding that the terrible, shitty smell was decayed flesh, and it was coming from them... and there was another one, stepping out from a door stoop across the street, a young woman in a stained T-shirt, hair tied back from a slack and mindless face. A groan from behind him. Leon shot a look over his shoulder and saw a youth with dark hair and rotting arms shamble out from the sidewalk darkness of an awning\u0027s shadow. Leon raised the Magnum and aimed at the closest, the man with suspenders, while his instincts screamed at him to run. He was terrified, but his trained logic continued to insist that there was an explanation for what he was seeing, that he was not looking at the walking dead.\\n\\n Control, procedure, you\u0027re a cop...\\n\\n \"All right! That\u0027s far enough! Don\u0027t move!\"\\n\\n His voice was strong, commanding and authorita- tive, and he was wearing his uniform, and God, why wouldn\u0027t they stop? The man in suspenders moaned again, blind to the weapon pointed at his chest and still flanked by the others, now less than ten feet away. \"Don\u0027t move!\" Leon said again, and the sound of his own panic made him back up a step, darting his gaze left and right, seeing that there were still more of the wailing, lurching people coming out of the\\n\\n shadows. Something grabbed his ankle. \"No!\" he shouted, whipped the gun around and saw that the corpse of the hit-and-run victim was scrabbling at his boot with one blood-crusted hand, working to drag her crippled body closer. Her gasping cry of frantic hunger rose to join those of the others as she tried to bite into his foot, bloody smears of saliva drooling off her abraded chin, dripping onto the leather. Leon fired into her upper back, the sharp, explosive crack of the massive weapon loosening her grip and at such close range, probably obliterating her heart. Spasming, she dropped back to the pavement and he turned and saw that the others were less than five feet away, and he fired twice more, the rounds splattering red flowers into the chest of the closest. The entry wounds spouted scarlet. The man in suspenders was hardly fazed by the twin gaping holes in his torso, his stagger faltering for only a second. He opened his bloody mouth and gasped out a hissing mewl of hunger, hands raised again as if to direct him to the source of relief.\\n\\n Must be on something, firepower like that could drop an elephant...\\n\\n Backing away, Leon fired again. And again. And again. And then the empty clattered to the pavement, another was slammed in, more rounds fired. And still they kept coming, oblivious to the shots that ripped at their stinking flesh. It was a bad dream, a bad movie, it wasn\u0027t real and Leon knew that if he didn\u0027t start believing, he was going to die. Eaten alive by these...\\n\\n Go ahead, Kennedy, say it. These zombies.\\n\\n Blocked from his Jeep, Leon stumbled away, still firing. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/city-of-the-dead-resident-evil-3/page-4.html","bookId":2458,"book":{"id":2458,"title":"City Of The Dead (Resident Evil #3)","description":"Storyline: On the front steps of City Hall, Mayor Harris announced in a press conference yesterday afternoon that the City Council will be hiring at least ten new police officers to join the Raccoon police, in response to the continued suspension of the Special Tactics and Rescue Squad (S.T.A.R.S.), in effect since the brutal murders that plagued Raccoon earlier this summer.
