{"id":80909,"no":34,"title":"Page 34","content":"They saw the aftermath of the explosion from ten miles outside the city, a black and billowing cloud that rose up into the early morning light and hung over Raccoon like a terrible storm or a bad dream, Rebecca thought, a recurring one. Umbrella. She didn\u0027t say it aloud, because it wasn\u0027t necessary. John and David hadn\u0027t gone through the Spencer estate nightmare, but they\u0027d been at the Cove facility, witnesses to what Umbrella was capable of; they knew. Nobody spoke as David stepped up the speed, his knuckles white on the wheel. For once, John didn\u0027t crack any jokes about what might have happened. They all knew that it was bad; before Jill, Chris, and Barry had left for Europe, Jill had wired them with her suspicions about another accident, and asked them to keep tabs. When the phone lines had gone down, they\u0027d loaded up the SUV and left Maine to see what could be done. The only question was how many people had died this time.\n Maybe this is the end, finally. A blast like that... Umbrella can\u0027t cover this up so easily, not if it\u0027s as bad as it looks.\n John finally broke the silence, his deep, mellow voice uncharacteristically subdued. \"Fail-safe?\" David sighed. \"Probably. And if there was a spill, we\u0027re not going in; we\u0027ll circle the city and then call for help from Latham. Umbrella is surely sending in its cleanup staff already.\"\n Rebecca nodded along with John. They weren\u0027t technically part of the S.T.A.R.S. anymore, but David had been a captain before, and with good reason. They fell back into a tense silence, the dawn-touched trees spinning past the utility vehicle, Rebecca won- dering what they would find...... when she saw the people, staggering up into the road, waving their arms. \"Hey...\" she started, but David was already hitting the brakes, slowing down as they neared the three- some of ragged strangers. A cop with a bandaged arm and a young woman in shorts, both of them holding weapons, and a little girl in a pink vest that was much too big for her. They weren\u0027t infected, or at least not showing signs that Rebecca could see, but they looked like hell nonetheless. With their ripped clothes and their faces pale and shocked beneath masks of dirt, they certainly could have passed for walking death. \"I\u0027ll talk,\" David said, his crisp British accent mild but firm, and then they were pulling up beside the Raccoon survivors. David opened his window and killed the engine, the young cop stepping forward as the woman slipped one grimy arm around the little girl\u0027s shoulders. \"There\u0027s been an accident, in Raccoon,\" he said, and although they were obviously tired and wounded and badly in need of help, there was a wariness in the cop\u0027s tone, a guarded, careful note that suggested just how bad things had been. \"A terrible accident. You don\u0027t want to go there, it\u0027s not safe.\" David frowned. \"What sort of accident, Officer?\" The young woman spoke up, her mouth a set and bitter line. \"An Umbrella accident,\" she said, and the cop nodded, and the little blond girl buried her face against the woman\u0027s hip. John and Rebecca exchanged a look, and David hit the switch to unlock the doors. \"Really? Those tend to be the worst kind,\" he said gently. \"We\u0027d be happy to help you, if you\u0027d like, or we could call for help...\"\n It was a question. The cop glanced back at the woman, then met David\u0027s gaze for several long beats. He must have seen something in David\u0027s face that he felt he could trust; he nodded slowly, then motioned for the woman and girl to come forward. \"Thanks,\" he said, the exhaustion finally coming through. \"If you could give us a ride, that\u0027d be great.\" David smiled. \"Please, get in. John, Rebecca -\n -would you assist...?\"\n John grabbed a couple of blankets out of the back as Rebecca reached for her medical kit, careful not to uncover the rifles tucked next to the wheel well.\n An Umbrella accident...\n Rebecca wondered if they knew how lucky they were to have survived it, but another look into those three exhausted, shell-shocked faces told her that they probably did. They started talking even before David turned the vehicle around and in a very short time, they dis- covered that they had a lot in common, as the child fell asleep and they drove back the way they\u0027d come, leaving the burning city behind.\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/city-of-the-dead-resident-evil-3/page-34.html","bookId":2458,"book":{"id":2458,"title":"City Of The Dead (Resident Evil #3)","description":"Storyline: \n On the front steps of City Hall, Mayor Harris announced in a press conference yesterday afternoon that the City Council will be hiring at least ten new police officers to join the Raccoon police, in response to the continued suspension of the Special Tactics and Rescue Squad (S.T.A.R.S.), in effect since the brutal murders that plagued Raccoon earlier this summer. Joined by Police Chief Brian Irons and all of Raccoon\u0027s Council members, Harris assured the gathered citizens and reporters that Raccoon City will once again be a safe community in which to live and work, and that the investigation into the eleven \"cannibal\" murders and three fatal wild-animal attacks is far from closed.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/city-of-the-dead-resident-evil-3.jpg","author":"S.D.
