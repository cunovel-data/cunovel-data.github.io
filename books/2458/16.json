{"id":80891,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"Leon found ada in the kennel, straining to lever up the rusted manhole cover that the reporter had told them about. She\u0027d turned up a crowbar from somewhere and had it wedged beneath the thick iron plate, her well-defined biceps lightly sheened with sweat as she worked the bar. She\u0027d managed to raise the cover about an inch, but let it drop back into place as he walked in, the metallic clang loud in the cold, empty room. Before he could say anything, she lay the crowbar on the cement floor and looked up at him with a strained half-smile, brushing at her rust-dirty hands. \"I\u0027m glad you\u0027re here. I don\u0027t think I\u0027m strong enough to do this by myself...\" He hadn\u0027t been sure before, but the helpless look she gave him cinched it; she was playing him, or trying to. He\u0027d known Ada for all of twenty minutes, but he doubted seriously that she\u0027d ever been helpless about anything. \"Looks like you\u0027re doing just fine,\" he said, holster-ing the Magnum but not making any move toward the manhole. He crossed his arms, frowning slightly. He wasn\u0027t angry, just curious. \"Besides, what\u0027s the hurry? I thought you wanted to talk to the reporter. About John, your Umbrella friend.\" The woman-in-distress look melted away and her delicate features turned cool and hard, but not in a bad way; it was as though she was letting her real self show, the strong and self-assured Ada he\u0027d first met. Leon could tell that he\u0027d surprised her by not rushing to her aid and was glad to see it; he had enough to worry about without being manipulated by a mysteri- ous stranger. She\u0027d been very careful to avoid his questions, but it was time for Ms. Wong to explain a few things. Ada stood up, meeting his gaze evenly. \"You heard him - he wasn\u0027t going to tell us anything. And with this place as dangerous as it is, I don\u0027t really want to stand around waiting for him to develop a con-science...\" She dropped her gaze, her voice softening.\"... and I don\u0027t even know if John\u0027s in Raccoon. But I do know that he\u0027s not here - and I want to leave before the station\u0027s completely overrun.\" It sounded good, but for some reason, he had the feeling that she was holding something back. For a few seconds, he struggled to think of a polite way to get her to open up - then decided to hell with it; under the circumstances, social graces would have to be suspended. \"What\u0027s going on, Ada? Do you know something that you\u0027re not telling me?\" She looked at him again, and again, he had the feeling that he\u0027d surprised her, but her cool, dark gaze was as unreadable as ever. \"I just want to get out of here,\" she said, and the sincerity of her tone was impossible to deny. If he didn\u0027t believe anything else she\u0027d said, he had to believe that much. And I wish it was that easy, but there\u0027s Claire, and even Ben, our asshole friend, and God knows how many others... Leon shook his head. \"I can\u0027t leave. Like I said, I may be the only cop left around here. If there are still people in the building, I have to at least try to help them. And I think it\u0027d be best if you came with me.\" Ada gave him another one of her half-smiles. \"I appreciate your concern, Leon, but I can take care of myself.\" He didn\u0027t doubt it, but he also didn\u0027t want to see her abilities tested. Granted, he was pretty untested himself, but he\u0027d been trained to deal with crisis situations, it was his job. And be honest with yourself - you lost Claire, you couldn\u0027t help Branagh, and Ben Bertolucci could give a rat\u0027s ass for your protection skills; you don\u0027t want to fail with Ada on top of all that. And you don\u0027t want to be alone. Ada seemed to know what he was thinking. Before he could come up with a convincing argument, she stepped forward and put one slender hand on his arm, the humor fading from her bright eyes. \"I know you want to do your job here, but you said it yourself - we have to find a way out of Raccoon, try and get outside help. And the sewers are probably the best chance we\u0027ve got...\" The light, gentle touch surprised him and sent an electric flutter through his belly, an unexpected flush of warmth that left him feeling confused and uncer- tain. He managed to keep his reaction from showing, but just barely. Ada continued, frowning thoughtfully. \"How about This - help me with the manhole cover, and let\u0027s see what\u0027s down there. If it looks dangerous, I\u0027ll come with you... but if it\u0027s not bad - well, we can talk about what to do next.\" He wanted to protest, but the truth was, he couldn\u0027t make her do anything she didn\u0027t want to do and he wanted very much for her to know that he wasn\u0027t some overbearing macho type, that he was receptive to compromise... ... and does the name \"John\" ring a bell? This isn\u0027t a date for Chrissake, stop thinking with your hor-mones. Feeling awkward even thinking about it with her hand still on his arm, Leon stepped away, nodding briskly. Together, they crouched down next to the manhole. Leon picked up the crowbar and jammed one end beneath the lid; as he pulled back, Ada pushed on the bar, and with a heavy grating sound the thick metal plate came up. Leon put his back into it and heaved the lid to one side, clearing the opening - - and both of them recoiled back from the smell that bellowed out of the dark hole, a choking, dark stench of blood and piss and vomit. \"Gah, what is that?\" Leon coughed. Ada sat back on her heels, one hand pressed to her mouth. \"The bodies from the garage, they must have dumped them down here...\" Before he could ask what she was talking about, a scream of pure terror echoed through the basement halls, filtering through the closed door. The cry went on and on, a man\u0027s voice, the panicked scream suddenly changing to a gurgling shriek of pain. The reporter. Leon locked gazes with Ada, saw the same startled realization flash across her face and then they were both up and running, pulling out their weapons and sprinting through the door before the echoes died. I left him, I shouldn\u0027t have left him... They ran down the corridor for the cell block, guilt driving Leon to run faster than he thought he could. Someone or something had gotten to Bertolucci and had passed right behind his back to do it. Sherry stood in Mr. Irons\u0027s office, rubbing at her good luck pendant and wishing that Claire would come back. She had crawled through a dozen dusty tunnels to get away from the monster and to lead it away from Claire, and was pretty sure it had worked - she hadn\u0027t heard it again, and had come back to find that Claire had left; if the monster had found her, she would have been dead and ripped apart. But she\u0027s not here. Nobody is... Sherry sat on the edge of a low table in the middle of the room, wondering what she should do. She\u0027d gotten used to being alone, and hadn\u0027t even realized how lonely she\u0027d been, but meeting Claire had changed that. Sherry wanted to see her again, she wanted to be with other people, she wanted her parents so bad that it made her ache. Even Mr. Irons would be okay, although Sherry didn\u0027t like him; she\u0027d only met him a couple of times but he was weird, showy and fake - and his office was creepy besides. Still, she\u0027d gladly put up with him if it meant she didn\u0027t have to be alone anymore... Footsteps. In the hall outside of the office. Sherry stood up and ran to the open door that led back to the armor room, hoping it was Claire and ready to sprint for cover if it wasn\u0027t. She ducked around the door frame and held her breath, staring at the stuffed tiger in the hall and silently praying. The outer door opened and closed. Muffled steps on the carpet, moving slowly, and she tensed to run, at the same time trying to muster up enough courage to sneak a look... \"Sherry?\" Claire! \"I\u0027m here!\" She ran back into the office and there was Claire, her whole face lit up with a beaming smile. Sherryflew into her open arms, so happy to see her that she wanted to cry.\"I was looking for you,\" Claire said, holding her tightly. \"Don\u0027t run off like that again, okay?\"Claire knelt in front of her, still smiling, but Sherry could see the worry behind the smile and in her cool gray eyes. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" Sherry said. \"I had to, or the monster would have come.\" \"What does it look like?\" Claire asked, her smile fading. \"Does it look - kind of red, with claws?\"Sherry swallowed heavily. \"The inside-out men! You saw one, didn\u0027t you?\" Incredibly, Claire grinned, shaking her head. \"Yeah, that\u0027s exactly what I saw, an inside-out man... good description.\" She looked at Sherry more seriously, frowning. \" \u0027Men\u0027? There are more of them?\" Sherry nodded. \"Yes, but they aren\u0027t anything like the monster. I only saw him once, from behind, but he\u0027s a man, a giant man...\"Claire seemed excited. \"Bald? Wearing a long coat?\"No, he had hair, brown hair. And one of his arms was all screwed up, a lot longer than the other one.\" Claire sighed. \"Terrific. Raccoon\u0027s got something for everyone, sounds like...\" She reached out and took Sherry\u0027s hand, squeezing it. \"... and that\u0027s all the more reason that you should stay with me. You\u0027ve done a really good job of taking care of yourself, and you\u0027ve been very brave, but until we find your parents, I feel like it\u0027s my job for now, to watch out for you. And if the monster comes, I\u0027ll just kick its ass, okay?\" Sherry laughed, surprised into it. She liked that Claire didn\u0027t talk down to her. She nodded, and Claire squeezed her hand again. \"Good. So we\u0027ve got zombies, inside-out men, and a monster. And a big bald guy... Sherry, do you know what happened to Raccoon? How this all got started? Anything you can tell me, anything at all - it could be important.\" Sherry frowned, thinking. \"Well, there were a bunch of murders last May, or June I think - like ten people got killed. And then they stopped, but then maybe a week ago, somebody got attacked.\" Claire nodded encouragingly. \"Okay. Did more people start getting attacked, or... what did the police do?\" Sherry shook her head, wishing she could be more helpful. \"I don\u0027t know. Right before that girl got attacked, my mother called from work really upset, and told me that I couldn\u0027t leave the house. Mrs. Willis - that\u0027s our next-door neighbor - she came over and cooked dinner for me, and that\u0027s how I heard about that girl. Mom called again the next day, and told me that she and Dad were stuck at the plant and wouldn\u0027t be home for a while - and then like three days ago, she called again and told me to come here. I went to see if Mrs. Willis would come with me, but her house was dark and empty. I guess things had already gotten pretty bad by then.\" Claire was staring at her intently. \"You were alone all that time? Even before you got to the station?\" Sherry nodded. \"Well yeah, but I stay alone a lot. My parents are both scientists; their work is impor-tant, and sometimes they can\u0027t stop in the middle of what they\u0027re doing. And my mother always says that I\u0027m very self-sufficient, when I want to be.\" \"Do you know what kind of work your parents do? At Umbrella?\" Claire was still watching her closely. \"They develop cures for things, for diseases,\" Sher-ry said proudly. \"And make medicines, like serums that hospitals use...\" She trailed off, noticing that Claire seemed dis- tracted suddenly, her gaze far away. It was a look she had seen plenty of times before, on both of her parents\u0027 faces - and it meant that they weren\u0027t really listening anymore. But as soon as she stopped talking, Claire refocused on her, reaching out to pat her on the shoulder - and for some stupid reason, that made Sherry want to cry again. Because she\u0027s listening to me. Because she wants to watch out for me now. \"Your mother\u0027s right,\" Claire said gently, \"you\u0027re very self-sufficient, and that you\u0027ve made it this far means that you\u0027re also very strong. That\u0027s good, because we\u0027re both going to have to be strong, to make it out of here.\" Sherry felt her eyes go wide. \"What do you mean? Leave the station? But there are zombies all over the place, and I don\u0027t know where my parents are, what if they need help or they\u0027re looking for me...\" \"Sweetie, I\u0027m sure your folks are just fine,\" Claire said quickly. \"They\u0027re probably still at the plant, hiding and safe, just like you were - waiting for people to come from outside of the city, to, to make everything better...\" \"You mean kill everything,\" Sherry said. \"I\u0027m twelve, you know, I\u0027m not a baby.\" Claire smiled. \"Sorry. Yeah, to kill everything. But until the good guys come, we\u0027re on our own. And the best thing we can do, the smartest thing, is to get out of their way - to get as far out of their way as possible. You\u0027re right, the streets aren\u0027t safe, but maybe we can get a car...\" It was Claire\u0027s turn to trail off. She stood up and walked toward the big desk at the far end of the office, looking around as she went. \"Maybe Chief Irons left his car keys here, or another weapon, something we can use...\" Claire saw something on the floor behind the desk. She crouched down and Sherry hurried after her, as much to stay close as to see what she\u0027d found. She already knew that she didn\u0027t want to lose her again, no matter what else happened. \"There\u0027s blood here,\" Claire said softly, so softlythat Sherry thought she hadn\u0027t meant to say it out loud. \"So?\" Claire looked up at the plain tan wall, frowning, then back down at the big drying splotch of red on the floor. \"It\u0027s still wet, for one thing. And see the way it\u0027s just kind of cut off? There should be some on the wall here...\" She rapped on the dark wood trim that lined the wall, then on the wall itself. There was an obvious difference; a dull thump from the trim, but the wall sounded hollow. \"Is there a room back there?\" Sherry asked. \"I don\u0027t know, it sounds like it. And it would explain where he took... where he took off to earli-er. Chief Irons.\" She glanced up at Sherry as she started to feel along the baseboards, running her hands up the wall and pushing at it. \"Sherry, look around the desk, see if you can find like a switch or a lever. My guess is it would be hidden somewhere, maybe in one of the drawers...\" Sherry started to move behind the desk and tripped, her foot sliding on a handful of pencils that she hadn\u0027t seen. She grabbed at the desktop, trying to catch her balance, but still came down pretty hard on her bare knees. \"Ow!\" Claire was next to her right away, putting an armaround her shoulders. \"Are you okay?\" \"Yeah. I just... hey! Look!\" Her bruised knees forgotten, Sherry pointed at the switch under the top drawer of the desk, set into a small metal plate. It looked like a light switch, but it had to be for the secret door, she just knew it.; I found it! Claire reached out and flipped the switch and behind them, a section of the wall a few feet across slid smoothly upwards, disappearing into the ceiling and exposing a dimly lit room lined with oversized bricks. Cool, damp air breezed into the office; it was a secret passage, just like in the movies. Together, they stood and stepped toward the open- ing, Claire holding Sherry back with one arm until she\u0027d looked first. The small room was totally empty - three brick walls and a stained wood floor, and only about half the size of the office. The fourth wall was dominated by a big old-fashioned elevator gate, the kind that pushed to one side. \"Are we going to take it?\" Sherry asked. She was excited but nervous, too. Claire had taken her gun out. She crouched down next to Sherry and smiled, but it wasn\u0027t a happy smile, and Sherry knew what was coming before Claire said a word. \"Sweetie, I think it would be safest if I went and looked around first, and you stayed here...\" \"But you said we should stay together! You said we could find a car and leave! What if the monster comes back and you\u0027re not here, or you get killed?\" Claire hugged her, but Sherry felt almost sick with helpless anger. She was going to tell her not to worry, that the monster wouldn\u0027t come, that nothing bad would happen and then she was going to leave anyway. Stupid grownup lies... Claire leaned back, smoothing Sherry\u0027s hair away from her face. \"I don\u0027t blame you for being scared. I\u0027m scared, too. This is a bad situation and hon-estly, I don\u0027t know what\u0027s going to happen. But I want to do the right thing by you, and that means that I\u0027m not going to take you into a situation where you could get hurt, not if I can help it.\" Sherry swallowed back tears, trying again. \"But I want to come with you... what if you don\u0027t come back?\" \"I\u0027m going to come back,\" Claire said firmly, \"I promise. And if... if I don\u0027t, I want you to hide again, like before. Somebody will come, help is going to come soon, and they\u0027ll find you.\" At least she was being honest; Sherry didn\u0027t like it, not at all, but at least there was that and from the look on her face, Sherry could see that there was nothing she could say to change her mind. She could be a baby about it, or she could accept it. \"Be careful,\" she whispered, and Claire hugged her again before standing and moving toward the eleva- tor. She pushed a button next to the gate and there was a low, soft hum; after a few seconds an elevator car rose into view, coming to a gentle stop. Claire pulled the gate open and stepped inside, turning for a last look at Sherry. \"Stay here, sweetie,\" she said. \"I\u0027ll be back in a few minutes.\" Sherry forced herself to nod and Claire let the gate close. She touched something inside the elevator and the car went down, her smiling, strong face descending out of sight, leaving Sherry by herself in the cold, dark passage. Sherry sat down on the dusty floor and hugged her knees close to her body, rocking herself slowly. Claire was brave and smart, she\u0027d be back soon, she had to come back soon... \"I want my mommy,\" Sherry whispered, but there was nobody to hear. She was alone again, the thing she wanted least of all. But I\u0027m strong. I\u0027m strong, and I can wait. She rested her chin on one knee, touching the necklace her mother had given her for good luck, and started to wait for Claire to come back.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/city-of-the-dead-resident-evil-3/page-16.html","bookId":2458,"book":{"id":2458,"title":"City Of The Dead (Resident Evil #3)","description":"Storyline: On the front steps of City Hall, Mayor Harris announced in a press conference yesterday afternoon that the City Council will be hiring at least ten new police officers to join the Raccoon police, in response to the continued suspension of the Special Tactics and Rescue Squad (S.T.A.R.S.), in effect since the brutal murders that plagued Raccoon earlier this summer.
