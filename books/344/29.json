{"id":42517,"no":29,"title":"CHAPTER XXIX ON THE ISLAND","content":"When Guy scanned the island, and saw that it answered the description given in the papers bequeathed him by his uncle, his heart beat gladly. His pride was interested in the reliability of the information given him. It was on the faith of these that Mr. Saunders, his employer, had risked a considerable sum of money, and now it looked as if he would be richly repaid for his investment. As Guy stood on deck regarding the island, Captain Richmond walked up to his side. “Well, captain,” said Guy, “we have been successful. This is the island I wanted to find.” “Yes, it is the island; but what good will it do you?” Guy had not made a confidant of the captain except in a general way. He distrusted the man, and feared that in some manner he would interfere with his plans.{229} “I can tell you better after a few days,” answered Guy, guardedly. “I suppose you expect to find an immense treasure?” said Captain Richmond, with a sneer. “Perhaps so.” “Then all I can say is that you are probably doomed to disappointment.” “Why do you say that?” “All these stories of hidden treasures are old women’s tales.” “If I am disappointed,” said Guy, somewhat nettled, “you will not be a loser.” “I wasn’t thinking of that; but I hate to see a man make a fool of himself.” “Am I the man?” asked Guy, smiling. “No, but the man who has supplied you with money to make this expedition.” “When you see Mr. Saunders you can tell him so.” “Now, how long do you propose to delay my voyage in keeping me in this out-of-the-way place?” “As short a time as possible, Captain Richmond. I should like to go on shore at once, if convenient, and commence my search. Mr. Titcomb and Mr. Clark will go with me.” “Very well. I will send you ashore, as you desire.{230} I have this to say, however, that I shall not be willing to remain here more than three days.” “I protest against this limit, Captain Richmond,” said Guy, indignantly. “The contract which I made with your owners says nothing of any such limitations. I am paying a handsome sum for any detention which my business here may occasion.” “You are paying——” began the captain, with a sneer. “Yes, as the agent of Mr. Saunders,” responded Guy, firmly. The captain turned upon his heel and left Guy, but he gave orders that the long-boat should be lowered, and in five minutes Guy and his two assistants were on their way to the island. The Osprey anchored about a hundred yards from the shore, in order not to get into too shallow water. The boat trip was, therefore, a brief one. It was a beautiful morning. The island smiled in the bright rays of a tropical sun, and the luxuriant vegetation that covered the hills and plains made it look very attractive. “This is a charming spot, Guy,” said Abner Titcomb. “The pirates knew what they were about when they selected it.” “I imagine they cared very little for its appearance,{231}” said Guy. “It seems to be the nearest of the islands, and, therefore, the most accessible.” “If I were well provided with comforts, I shouldn’t object to spending a few months here,” said Luke Clark. “Nor I, if at the end of that time I could get off and sail for home.” They made for a little, sandy beach on the south shore, and one of the sailors, leaping out of the boat, hauled it upon the beach. Guy and his two assistants sprang out. “When do you want us to come back?” asked the boatswain. Guy took out his watch. “We shall spend the day on the island,” he said. “You can come for us at six o’clock.” “But we shall get hungry before that,” objected Titcomb. “I thought of that, and asked the steward to put up some lunch for us,” answered Guy, pointing to a square package wrapped in stout paper. “We shall want drink, also.” “It will be strange if we can’t find a spring on the island.” Guy and his two friends stood on the shore and watched the boat as it was rowed back to the ship. “I can understand the feelings of Robinson Crusoe,{232}” Guy said. “Here we are many thousand miles from home, on an island which has not even a name, so far as I know.” “True; but there’s our ship, ready to carry us away when we choose. That makes the difference between us and Crusoe.” “I should prefer that there should be a difference. I don’t care to feel myself a prisoner here.” “What are your plans for the day, Guy? You are the leader of our expedition. Shall we begin our search for the treasure immediately?” “To-day let us simply be explorers. I should like to see something of the island. Suppose we strike for the woods.” “Just as you say. We shall have a delightful walk.” The woods began about a mile from the beach, but there were scattered trees on the way. On their branches were birds of strange plumage. They were singing, but the songs were unlike any that the three explorers had heard in America. There were flowers, also, for on this far-away island it was the season of blooming, and their fragrance perfumed the air. “I wonder if there are any inhabitants?” said Luke Clark. “Probably there are no white inhabitants, and{233} I hope there are none of a different race. They might prove dangerous, and interfere with our plans.” “It almost seems a waste of productive power that such a delightful island should be uninhabited,” said Abner Titcomb. “Suppose it were within a few miles of Boston or New York, or near Portland, how it would attract visitors.” “Like Peak’s Island,” suggested Luke Clark. “Where is that?” asked Guy. “Three miles from Portland. It is much smaller than this, but it attracts many visitors in the summer.” “Unfortunately, we can’t move this island. Indeed, I shouldn’t want to till I have found the treasure.” They reached the edge of the woods and plunged in. There was very little underbrush, but the trees rose straight and erect, branching at a considerable distance from the ground. “What a fine grove for a camp meeting,” said Luke Clark. “Do you know how far the trees reach back, Guy?” “Three or four miles, according to my description.” “Shall we push through?” “Yes. Back of the woods rises the small hill{234} indicated on my plan of the island. I propose that we ascend that, and take a general view. It may be high enough for us to see the shore on the other side.” It was not a work of difficulty to reach the hill and ascend it. The rise was gradual, and the hill was comparatively bare of trees. Thus far they had discovered nothing that indicated any previous occupation by white men; but now on the summit of the hill they saw a pole looking somewhat like a telegraph pole. “Do you see that, Guy?” said Abner Titcomb. “Yes.” “That must have been placed there by white visitors.” “Probably by some of the pirates of whom my uncle speaks.” “Yes; and so far it is a confirmation of his story.” “You are right. It should be looked upon as encouraging.” There was something else that suggested former visits. On the top of the hill, a hundred feet from the pole, was a rude seat made by a plank resting upon supports at either end. “Let us sit down,” said Guy, “and take a general survey of the island.” \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2979/82144.html","bookId":344,"book":{"id":344,"title":"In Search of Treasure","description":"简介： I wish I could send you to college, Guy, said Mr. Fenwick, as they sat in the library, reading by the soft light of a student lamp.The speaker was the Rev.
