{"id":42510,"no":22,"title":"CHAPTER XXII THE CAPTAIN OF THE OSPREY","content":"“Guy, my son!” said Captain Grover, his face lighting up with unmistakable joy. “It does me good to see you again. Why, you’re quite two inches taller than when we parted at Bombay.” “Yes, captain; I think I have grown,” returned Guy, complacently. “When did you get back?” “Only last week. You are here almost as soon as I. Have you got through working for Mr. Saunders?” “Oh, no. I am still in his employ. I went to England to attend to some business for him, and I am now in America on the same errand.” “And does he make it worth your while?” “Yes,” answered Guy, smiling. “I won’t go into particulars. I haven’t done that even with my father. I will tell you, however, that since I have been home I have paid off a five hundred dollar mortgage on the parsonage.” “That is capital! Evidently Mr. Saunders is{181} a liberal man; and I am sure I am very glad, not only for your sake, but for the sake of my old friend, your father. How long do you stay in Bayport?” “That depends partly upon you.” “How is that?” “I may be your passenger on your next voyage.” “You mean to go back to Bombay, then?” “Yes; or at least in that direction. How long before you will start?” “Well, you see, Guy, that isn’t an easy question to answer.” “Why not, captain?” asked Guy, puzzled. “I’ll tell you. I have been cruising about for about fifteen years without any vacation, and I am minded to stay at home for six months at least, more especially as my only sister is coming on from Wisconsin, where she has been living ever since her marriage, twenty years since. There are only two of us now, for all the rest of the family are dead, and I may never see her again, as she means to go back to Wisconsin after her visit.” “I see, captain,” said Guy, in a tone of disappointment. “Of course, I can’t blame you, but it will interfere with my plans.” “I don’t see why that should be, Guy.” “I can’t wait six months.”{182} “You won’t need to. The Osprey will sail just the same as ever, but for this one voyage it will have a different commander. You ain’t set on sailing with me, are you?” “I should certainly prefer to sail with you, captain; but the main reason is that I should be more likely to make the arrangement with you that I desire. Who is to command the Osprey in your place?” “It’s an Englishman, Captain John Richmond. I have seen him, but I don’t know him very well. I am told that he is a thorough seaman, however.” “I don’t doubt that, as your owners have thought fit to employ him. But the arrangement I want to make is a very peculiar one, and I should feel more sure of doing it if you were to be still in command.” “You puzzle me, Guy. Heave ahead, and let me know what you are driving at.” “You are going to the house, are you not?” “Yes. I came down to take supper with your father, and I may stay over-night if he will keep me.” “He will be delighted to do that. It would take me too long to explain myself now, but I will go back to New Bedford with you to-morrow morning, and then we will talk the matter over. One{183} thing, however, I will ask. Say nothing of it to father, as I do not propose to tell him.” “Is that right, Guy?” “Yes. Father isn’t a practical man, as you know, and could not advise me in the matter. I have talked it over with Mr. Saunders, who is a shrewd man of business, and I think we can trust to his judgment.” “To be sure! to be sure! Let it lay over till to-morrow, then.” By this time they had reached the parsonage, and the minister welcomed his guest with unaffected cordiality. “Well, Fenwick, you are not sorry you trusted Guy to me, are you?” “No! no! my old friend! Nothing but good has come to him. He has been wonderfully fortunate, and has helped me out of what might have proved a serious trouble.” “Aye, Fenwick, he is a good boy.” “I am only sorry that my necessities have robbed the poor boy of his hard earnings. I have been blaming myself for my selfishness in accepting it.” “Don’t worry about that, father. I have money left, as much as I shall need. Besides, I am still in Mr. Saunders’ employ, and am receiving a liberal salary.”{184} “By the way, Guy,” said the captain, “how much are you receiving?” “I would tell you, if I knew, Captain Glover, but the amount has not been decided upon. I am sure of one thing—that it will be large. Besides, I am authorized to draw what I need.” “It is wonderful that a boy of Guy’s age should be so trusted,” said Mr. Fenwick. “True; but Mr. Saunders is under the strongest of obligations to him.” “How is that?” “Didn’t Guy tell you that he had saved his employer’s life?” “No,” answered the minister, in great surprise. “Why didn’t you tell me, Guy?” “It didn’t come into my mind, father.” “You are modest, Guy,” said the captain. “On the contrary, I might have wished father to understand that it was my business ability that influenced Mr. Saunders to offer me employment.” The story was told, and it was clear that it made Mr. Fenwick more than ever proud of Guy. “Besides,” added Captain Grover, “if Guy had not shown business ability he would not have been trusted with so important a commission.” Guy did not tell the captain of the thousand pounds which had been given him by Mr. Saunders{185} as part compensation for a share in the island treasure. He did not care that anyone should know the extent of his good fortune. Besides, if things went well, and the expedition which he was arranging should prove successful, he hoped to secure a considerably larger sum. This, however, was not certain. But whichever way things turned out, the five thousand dollars were his, and he wouldn’t be expected to return them. Even if he got no more, he would feel amply repaid for his trouble in examining his uncle George’s chest. Nothing more was said during the evening about business. The next morning, after breakfast, Guy notified his father that he would go up to New Bedford with Captain Grover. Upon this the minister made no comment. He had come to look upon Guy as his own master. Considering that he had already visited India and England, this was not surprising, although Guy still lacked several years of his majority. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2979/82137.html","bookId":344,"book":{"id":344,"title":"In Search of Treasure","description":"简介： I wish I could send you to college, Guy, said Mr. Fenwick, as they sat in the library, reading by the soft light of a student lamp.The speaker was the Rev.
