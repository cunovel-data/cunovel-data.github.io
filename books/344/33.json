{"id":42521,"no":33,"title":"CHAPTER XXXIII THE END OF JOHN WOLF’S NARRATIVE","content":"The three looked at each other in amazement. “John Richmond!” repeated Guy. “It is very strange. But read on. I think I can guess how he acted.” Luke Clark proceeded with the manuscript. “After the mate became captain, things changed for the sailors. Before, we had a strict disciplinarian, but a kindly one. No sailor who did his duty had anything to complain of. After that we were in charge of a tyrant. Captain Richmond, for this was his title now, did not forget his experiences or animosities as mate. There were several whom he disliked, but I think he hated me the most. He would have abused me, but I knew his feelings, and did not give him a chance. “I think he disliked me all the more on that account. I could see, by the way he looked at me at times, what hatred for me there was in his heart.{260} I think he disliked me the more because, though only a common seaman, I had had a fine education, and he knew it. In that respect I was his superior. “Well, about this time there came a storm. It was a very violent storm, unusual in that latitude, and it drove us out of our course very considerably. Instead of trying to get into the regular route for vessels bound to Bombay, Captain Richmond kept the ship in a northeasterly course till we struck the Agalegas Islands. “What could be his reason I did not comprehend, but I soon understood only too well. He went on shore, taking myself and another of the crew with him. We kept on till we reached the woods. Then the captain took my companion with him, and bade me remain where I was on some pretext. He was to come for me later on. “I waited unsuspectingly till I got tired. Then I ascended the hill, and to my dismay saw the Miranda—that was the name of our vessel—under full sail, bearing out to sea. In an instant the terrible truth flashed upon me. I had been left, helpless and alone, on this unknown island, with very little chance of ever leaving it, for it was not in the path of trading vessels. “I was almost frantic when I realized what a{261} fearful fate was reserved for me. I shrieked, I shook my fist at the receding vessel. I called down curses on the head of the fiend who had taken upon me this terrible revenge, or rather had inflicted upon me this unprovoked punishment, for I had done nothing to incur his hostility. “But do what I would I could not recall the Miranda. What excuse the captain made for my absence I do not know; but though I had friends on board, there was no one who would dare take my part, or call him to account for his action. “Four years have passed since then. They have been like forty. I have not starved, for the berries and fruits which the island affords, together with the fish I have been able to catch, have sustained me. But there was no one with whom I could hold converse—no one to whom I could speak, so it is a wonder I have not forgotten my native tongue. “For a time I bore up, sustained by the hope that some vessel would touch at the island and carry me back to England. In the four years I have seen two ships, but I was unable to attract the attention of anyone on board. “So hope died at last, and I have come to the conclusion that for me there is no release, no way of escape. I am forty-two years of age. Under{262} ordinary circumstances I might hope to live thirty years longer. But what would life be on this island, cut off from human companionship? I would rather end it all, and have decided to do so. When I have completed this record I shall go to a cliff on the northern shore of the island, and fling myself into the sea. Whether any eye will read these lines, I cannot tell. I hope so. I hope that someone will learn the perfidious and cruel conduct of John Richmond, and pity his poor victim. John Wolf.” When the story had been read the three looked at one another in stupefaction. “It is terrible,” said Guy. “Why is it that such things are permitted?” “Don’t you think, Guy, that this partly explains Captain Richmond’s reluctance to stay here?” asked Abner Titcomb. “Yes,” answered Guy, quickly. “I had not thought of that, but it is probably the case.” “A man who would be capable of wronging a poor sailor like John Wolf, and dooming him to a hopeless captivity, is quite capable of repeating the atrocious act,” observed Luke Clark, significantly. “Yes,” said Titcomb, gravely. “I agree with{263} you. It will be well for us to find that treasure as soon as possible. We run a risk every time we come here.” Luke Clark had been turning over the leaves of the memorandum book from which he had read the sailor’s story. “There is something more,” he said; “a post-script. It may be important. I will read it.” This was what he read: “I may as well record here an important discovery I chanced to make one day. It is of no use to me, but it may benefit the persons into whose hands this book may fall. At the north end of the island, about two hundred feet from the edge of the bluff, there is a group of trees arranged singularly in the shape of a cross. Between the second and third trees, at about eighteen inches from the surface, is a sailor’s chest, full of gold, silver, and jewels. I cannot estimate the value, but it must be large. I fancy it was hidden here by pirates. It must have been forgotten, however, for no one has visited it since I have been on this island. If I could only get away, this treasure would make me rich. It is a tantalizing thought. As I am situated it is of no earthly use to me. Some time—it may be years hence—it will be found by{264} some lucky person, perhaps by the one who reads this account, and it will make him rich. Such good fortune is not for me. If I could only escape from this island, which, charming as it is, I have learned to detest, I would be willing to live in abject poverty for the rest of my life. Wealth is far from my thoughts——” “Is that all?” asked Guy, when Luke Clark stopped reading. “Yes.” “It is indeed strange. I thought the group of trees must be in the wood somewhere. We have been on the wrong scent.” “But we have succeeded at last. Let us be thankful for that. We can probably finish up our work in a day or two, and then—we can go home.” “We must go to Bombay first.” “Yes. We can stand that, since the delay will be brief.” “Shall we tell Captain Richmond that we have succeeded?” asked Luke. “Perhaps it will be well to drop a hint that we are on the point of making a discovery. That will encourage him, and insure his waiting. It is not well to tell him too much.”{265} “It is time to go down to the beach. Only one day more!” The three descended the hill, and reached the beach about five o’clock. They were seen from the ship, and the boat was sent for them. “Well,” said the captain, with his usual sneer, as they climbed on deck, “have you discovered the mare’s nest?” The remark was addressed to Guy. “I have reason to think we shall locate the treasure to-morrow, Captain Richmond.” “What ground have you for that assertion?” asked the captain, quickly. “Excuse my explaining now, but I have good reasons for my belief.” Captain Richmond scanned Guy closely, being surprised by his confident tone. Guy’s face was bright and cheerful, and confirmed his words. He thought that the captain would question him further, but the commander only looked thoughtful, and turning on his heel without a word went down to his cabin. “I wish I could read his thoughts,” Guy said to himself. “He doesn’t seem glad that I am likely to succeed. He even looks as if he were disappointed.”{266} “Very likely. He’s a strange man, and a disagreeable one.” Later in the evening, say about nine o’clock, Abner Titcomb and Luke Clark were leaning over the side, talking, as was natural, of the stirring events of the day, when the captain passed, neither of them being aware of his nearness. There was one word which caught his attention. It was the name Miranda. He stopped short, and there was a startled look on his face. “Did I hear the name Miranda?” he asked, quickly. “Yes,” answered Titcomb, conscious of his imprudence. The captain turned away, but he looked suspicious and agitated, and began to mutter to himself, looking darkly from time to time at the two men. “Does he suspect anything, do you think?” asked Titcomb. “No; I don’t think so.” “All the same, I wish that I had kept my tongue between my teeth.” \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2979/82148.html","bookId":344,"book":{"id":344,"title":"In Search of Treasure","description":"简介： I wish I could send you to college, Guy, said Mr. Fenwick, as they sat in the library, reading by the soft light of a student lamp.The speaker was the Rev.
