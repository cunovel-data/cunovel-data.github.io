{"id":42493,"no":5,"title":"CHAPTER V AN ADVENTURE IN BOMBAY","content":"Guy’s conversation with Captain Grover left him with a feeling of disappointment. He felt that the captain had little faith in the reality of the treasure, and considered his enterprise a failure in advance. Guy had overlooked the principal difficulties in the way. He had managed to reach the Indian Ocean, but this had brought him no nearer the realization of his hopes. If he had had nothing on his mind he might have enjoyed the bright, calm days and the clear skies, with glimpses here and there of islands covered with tropical vegetation. But he had started on his voyage with a purpose. He wanted to find and secure the treasure hinted at in his uncle’s letter, and make his father independent for life. Of this there seemed to be now no chance, or next to none. There was nothing for him to do except to remain on board the Osprey till the vessel reached{38} Bombay. Then there would be the return voyage, at the end of which he would have seen considerable of the world, but would have gained nothing to repay him for the year he had spent away from home. But there was no help for it. The captain would not change his course, and Guy must be content to leave the island unvisited, and the great problem unsolved. At last they reached Bombay. Guy surveyed the place with curious interest. He was not prepared to find it so large. A city which contains seven hundred thousand inhabitants is a great city in any part of the world. Not having any duties on board the ship, Guy was allowed to go and come when he pleased. He found that among the foreign residents the English were the most prominent and influential. His walks were chiefly in what is called the European town, but he frequently strolled through the more picturesque part occupied by the natives. One evening he was sauntering through the Persian quarter when he was startled by seeing a brown-faced native, his head surmounted by a turban, dart from an alleyway and pursue a well-dressed man, apparently either English or American.{39} That his object was murder or robbery, perhaps both, seemed evident, for he held in his hand a long, narrow, dangerous-looking knife. Guy was not only courageous, but prompt. He carried a stout cane, not that he needed its support, but because he had been recommended to have it with him for defense, if needed. He did not pause a moment, but springing forward, brought it down with emphasis on the arm of the Persian. The native gave a sharp, shrill cry, which attracted the attention of the man whom he had intended to attack. He was clearly an Englishman, inclined to be stout, and apparently about forty-five years of age. He looked quickly from the native to Guy, and back again. “What’s the matter?” he asked. “Only that this man was about to attack you with his knife.” “And you saved me?” “Yes; I was, fortunately, in time to prevent his striking you.” “I don’t know how to thank you, but I must deal with this scoundrel, first.”{40} He seized the Oriental by the throat, and forced him to his knees. “Dog!” he said, “what have you to say before I kill you?” The cowardly fellow uttered voluble and abject entreaties for pardon in bad English. The purport of his speech was that he was a poor man, and had no money. “Forgive me, Mr. Saunders,” he said. “Ha! You know my name!” said the Englishman. He bent over and scanned the face of his would-be assailant closely. “I know him,” he said, briefly. “He was a native servant in my employ. I had to discharge him because I found him dishonest and a liar. Probably his attack to-night was prompted by a spirit of revenge.” “Don’t kill me!” pleaded the Persian, in terrified accents. “So you would have killed me, you scoundrel!” retorted the Englishman, shaking him vigorously. “I—pardon me—I didn’t know it was you, worshipful sir!” “You knew it well enough, I’ll be bound!” “If you will go with me,” went on the Englishman, turning to Guy, “I will conduct this fellow{41} to the police office. I do not propose to let him off. He is evidently a dangerous man, and, coward as he is, he may do harm unless he is secured.” Guy readily accompanied his new acquaintance, and saw Isef, as he was called, placed in the hands of the police officials. He agreed, also, to appear the next day and give the testimony of an eye-witness as to the man’s felonious attempt to assault Mr. Saunders. “And now,” said the Englishman, after this matter was disposed of, “let me know the name of the boy who has done me such an important service.” “My name is Guy Fenwick.” “Are you English?” “No, sir; I am an American boy.” “I thought so. Though there are resemblances, there is a dash about you Americans that I don’t find in my own countrymen. But how does it happen that you are so far from home?” “I came to Bombay as a passenger on the American ship Osprey, Captain Grover.” “A passenger? Then you are not connected with the ship?” “No, sir.” “Did you come here on a business errand?” “Partly, sir; but it is business of a strange nature.{42} If you will let me call upon you to-morrow, I shall be glad to tell you what it is.” “I shall certainly wish to know, and if it is anything in which I can help you, I will try to do so.” “You don’t know how much you are promising, Mr. Saunders,” said Guy, smiling. “No, I don’t know that; but I do know that you have saved my life this evening,” returned the Englishman, earnestly. Guy did not gainsay him, for he knew that it was true. Had the Persian driven his knife into the back of the English merchant the blow would have been instantly fatal. “Perhaps I had better leave you now, sir,” said Guy. “The captain expects me to report at the ship before ten o’clock.” “Very well; but I shall expect to see you to-morrow at my office.” “Where is it, sir?” In reply, Mr. Saunders handed Guy his card. The office was on the principal business street in the European town. Guy was already sufficiently acquainted with Bombay to know exactly where it was located. “I will come, sir,” he said.{43} When Guy returned to the ship the captain said: “You are late to-night, Guy.” “Yes, sir; I was detained by important business.” “So you have business here already?” returned Captain Grover, smiling. “Yes, sir. Shall I tell you about it?” “If it won’t take too long.” “I was fortunate enough to save the life of an English merchant.” Guy here gave particulars. “John Saunders!” repeated the captain, in surprise. “Why, he is one of the wealthiest and most prominent men in the English colony.” “Whatever he is, he was very near death to-night.” “Did he ask you to call upon him?” “Yes. I am to call to-morrow.” “By all means keep the appointment,” said the captain, in a significant tone. “I certainly shall. Mr. Saunders seems to be very friendly to me, and I am glad to have made his acquaintance. Do you know, Captain Grover, he is the first Englishman I ever met; that is, to become acquainted with.” At eleven o’clock the next day Guy presented himself at the office of his English friend.{44} He sent in his card by a young Persian who seemed to be in the merchant’s employ. He was received at once. “I am glad to see you, my young friend,” said the merchant, cordially. “I didn’t fully realize till after you left me what a narrow escape I had. It is God’s mercy that I am alive to-day.” “The danger came so suddenly, and was so soon over, that I have not realized it yet.” “I realize it, and shall always remember it. But you came here to explain the business that brought you to Bombay.” “I had no thought of Bombay, Mr. Saunders. It was an island in the Indian Ocean that I wished to visit.” “Indeed! Have you visited it?” “No, sir; and I fear that I shall never have an opportunity to do so.” “I am in the dark. I do not understand you.” “Then, sir, I will try to explain, but I am not sure what you will think of my enterprise.” “Go on.” The merchant settled himself in a posture of attention, and Guy began his narrative. He was listened to without interruption. Guy could not gather from the merchant’s expression what impression the story was making upon him.{45} When he finished, Mr. Saunders said: “Your tale is certainly a strange one, and your business of a remarkable character for a boy of your age.” Here he paused. “I am not prepared to express any opinion yet,” he added. “I must take a little time to think it over. Meanwhile I will detain you through the day. I shall be glad if you will take dinner with me.” “I shall be happy to do so.” “Then if you will occupy yourself with the papers and magazines you will find on yonder table, I will write some letters which must go by the next steamer, and will then be at your disposal.” \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2979/82120.html","bookId":344,"book":{"id":344,"title":"In Search of Treasure","description":"简介： I wish I could send you to college, Guy, said Mr. Fenwick, as they sat in the library, reading by the soft light of a student lamp.The speaker was the Rev.
