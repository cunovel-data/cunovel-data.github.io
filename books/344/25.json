{"id":42513,"no":25,"title":"CHAPTER XXV CAPTAIN RICHMOND","content":"Captain Grover went on board the Osprey when she was ready to sail. “Captain Richmond,” said the old captain, “this is my young friend, Guy Fenwick, who has engaged you to take him to one of the Agalegas Islands.” Captain Richmond was a tall, dark-complexioned man, with a sallow skin, and an unpleasant expression of countenance. “Humph, a boy!” he said, in a tone by no means cordial. “Yes, a boy, Captain Richmond, but quite as much entitled to consideration as a man. He represents the wealthiest English merchant in Bombay.” Captain Richmond shrugged his shoulders. “I don’t half like leaving the direct course,” he said. “It seems like a crazy idea.” He seemed determined to make himself disagreeable. Guy felt it, and he more than ever regretted{197} that he was not to sail with his friend, Captain Grover. The latter was considerably annoyed, and he said, sharply: “I take it, Captain Richmond, that this is no concern of yours. This young man has made a contract with the owners, and he has agreed to pay them well for the extra length of the voyage.” “It strikes me, Captain Grover, that you are taking a liberty in talking to me in this style,” said Captain Richmond, angrily. “I am the captain, not you!” “True; but I know the captain’s duties. The owners have made a certain agreement with my young friend here, and it is as his friend that I warn you that this contract must be carried out in good faith.” “I will thank you to mind your own business,” retorted Captain Richmond, wrathfully. “I propose to do so, and should you attempt to interfere with Guy in carrying out his plans, I will report this conversation to the owners of the Osprey.” This was said so sternly, and in such a determined tone, that Captain Richmond did not dare to reply. He turned on his heel without a word and walked away.{198} “I am afraid I shall have trouble with the captain,” said Guy, when the latter was out of hearing. “I wish so much that you were in command.” “I wish so, too, Guy; but you understand why I have taken a vacation.” “Evidently Captain Richmond doesn’t like the idea of leaving the direct course.” “No; but it is none of his business. That is a matter between you, representing Mr. Saunders, and the owners.” “I think my being a boy may lead to his treating me with less ceremony.” “The only thing to do, Guy, is to stick up for your rights. Even if you are a boy, your rights are just the same. Should the captain break the contract, you could, of course, withhold the money you have agreed to pay the owners, and this would get him into hot water.” “You advise me, then, to be firm?” “Surely. It is your right and your duty. And by the way, Guy, you will remember that you are not alone. You have two strong and able assistants who are not boys, but independent men. They will help you to enforce your rights.” “I see that your advice to me was good. Had I gone alone, I am afraid my plans would have{199} failed. Does the captain know why I want to visit the island?” “I presume so. Probably he thinks it a foolish enterprise, and that may account in part for his cavalier treatment of you. Of course, it is none of his business, and you need not hesitate to hint as much if he begins to talk roughly.” Guy considered this good advice, and determined to act upon it. He felt that he must deport himself in a manner which might be unbecoming in an ordinary boy, but was called for by the fact that he was acting for Mr. Saunders. It was his duty to guard the interests of his employer. When he bade good-bye to Captain Grover he felt a presentiment that the voyage on which he had embarked would be an unpleasant one, and that Captain Richmond would make it so. But Guy had pluck, and though he expected a conflict, he did not fear it. The first outbreak came very soon after the sailing of the Osprey. Dinner was announced. Guy was, of course, to eat at the captain’s table, but when he entered he found that no seats had been placed for his two assistants. “How is this, Captain Richmond?” said Guy,{200} as he took his seat. “I see no places at the table for Mr. Titcomb and Mr. Clark.” “They will eat with the sailors,” replied the captain, curtly. “I beg pardon, Captain Richmond,” said Guy, calmly, though he was very angry, “I will consent to no such arrangement.” “You won’t, eh?” snarled the captain. “Who is the captain of this craft—you or I?” “You, sir; but my arrangement was not made with you, but with the Messrs. Gray.” “These men are your servants. I don’t have servants at my table.” “They are not my servants. They, like myself, are in the employ of Mr. Saunders, of Bombay.” “I don’t know Mr. Saunders.” “Perhaps not; but I do. I know that unless these gentlemen are treated with proper respect and consideration he will refuse to pay the sum he has contracted to give your owners.” “I am an English captain, and do not care to meet common men on an equality.” “These men whom you call common are as good as you or myself. One of them is the brother-in-law of Captain Grover; the other is his friend. But, above all, they are American citizens, and as such are entitled to respect.”{201} “I haven’t much respect for a Yankee,” muttered the captain. “I won’t argue with you on that point, though I am myself a Yankee,” returned Guy. “I will, however, call your attention to the contract I made with your owners, the Messrs. Gray. It is expressly stated that these men are to be received as first-class passengers, and to be treated as such. Will you be kind enough to cast your eyes over this document?” Captain Richmond reluctantly took from Guy’s hand the paper he extended to him, and looked over it. It was as Guy had stated. Titcomb and Clark were designated as first-class passengers, and were to be treated as such. “I am surprised,” said the captain, in a tone of annoyance, “that Messrs. Gray should have made such an agreement.” “It is conclusive, however,” returned Guy, coldly. “Will you kindly see that seats are placed for my two companions?” “It shall be done at the next meal. To-day they can eat as soon as we have finished.” Though Guy might have demanded more than this, he did not care to make a fuss. He felt that in the controversy he had carried his point.{202} Guy spoke of the matter afterward to the two men. “Why,” exclaimed Abner Titcomb, “the mean upstart! So he thinks we are not fit to sit at the table with his royal highness, does he? If I had him at my home in Maine we would soon see who is the best man.” “I wouldn’t have consented to eat with the sailors,” said Luke Clark, “though there isn’t a sailor aboard that I don’t feel as much respect for as I do for Captain Richmond. But I know that he meant to insult and degrade us, and I have too much respect for myself as an American citizen to allow that.” Though Guy had carried his point, neither he nor his companions enjoyed their meals at the captain’s table. The only other person who sat there was the mate, and he would often be on duty, so that he would not eat at the same time with them. His name was Forbush, and he was a New Hampshire man, as agreeable as the captain was morose. Generally there was very little conversation at meal-time. Captain Richmond addressed Guy, but seldom vouchsafed a word to Titcomb or Clark. “I wish Forbush were captain,” said Abner Titcomb,{203} one day. “He is one of our own people, while Captain Richmond has no sympathy for us.” “I wonder why the owners gave the command to such a man?” added Luke Clark. “He is an experienced seaman, and understands his business, so Captain Grover told me. I suppose that accounts for it,” answered Guy. “I am afraid we shall see trouble before the end of the voyage,” said Titcomb, lowering his voice. “I will tell you what I have heard of the captain from one of the sailors.”","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2979/82140.html","bookId":344,"book":{"id":344,"title":"In Search of Treasure","description":"简介： I wish I could send you to college, Guy, said Mr. Fenwick, as they sat in the library, reading by the soft light of a student lamp.The speaker was the Rev.
