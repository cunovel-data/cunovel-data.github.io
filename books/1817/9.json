It’s good to be back home.” She walked over to my dad and gave him a passionate kiss; a long kiss that wouldn’t stop. “Ugh, will you two knock it off already or take it upstairs.” “Trust me, son; we are right now.” My dad winked. I rolled my eyes and grabbed my bags and went to my room. I heard my mom giggling behind me. I threw my bag on the bed and pulled out my phone, noticing a text message from Aiden. “Hey, bro, are you back in town yet? We have some serious partying to do tonight at Tina Brian’s house. Everyone is going to be there.” “Hey, I just got back. What time is the party?” “Eight o’clock.” “I’ll meet you there.” Score. That party was exactly what I needed. Tina was a good friend. We occasionally hooked up and enjoyed each other’s company. She wasn’t my type, though. Don’t get me wrong, she was a very nice and sexy girl, but there wasn’t that spark there that Hailey and I had. A spark that I never thought would go away. I sat down on my bed and pulled out a picture of me and Hailey that I hid in my nightstand. Memories of our greatest times together flooded my mind and hurt me like hell. I picked up my phone and pulled up her name. Fuck it! I sent her a text message. “Hi, how are you?” “Hey, Collin. I’m good. How are you?” I wished I could tell her that I was good too, but I couldn’t lie to her. “Not good, Hailey. I miss you like hell.” “Don’t start with that again. You need to move on, Collin.” Move on? Was she fucking serious? “Have you moved on, Hailey?” “Yes, I have. I’m sorry if it hurts you, but I’ve met someone.” My stomach felt sick when I read that and my heart began to ache something fierce. “Good for you. I won’t ever bother you again.” “I’m sorry, but I believe that we weren’t meant to be.” How could she be such a heartless bitch? It was like one morning she woke up a completely different person. I didn’t even know who she was anymore. She was not the girl I fell in love with all those years ago. I didn’t respond to her last message. If she believed we weren’t meant to be and she found someone else, then so be it. I wouldn’t lie and say that I wasn’t completely devastated, because I was – all over again. Her words hurt me more than I ever imagined they would. If she wanted me to move on, then that was what I would do, but I could promise you that I would never allow myself to hurt like that again. I put my hand on the doorknob and, as I turned it and opened the door, I was startled when I saw Julia standing there. “Welcome back.” She smiled as she hugged me. “Jesus, Julia, you scared me.” “Sorry, but you’re the one who opened the door. I was just getting ready to knock. Where are Mom and Dad?” “Where do you think?” I said as I walked out of my room, shut the door, and looked down the hall. “Oh,” she said as she followed me down the stairs. I went into the kitchen and Julia sat down at the table. “How are you feeling?” I asked. “I’m feeling okay. How are you?” “I’m great, Julia!” I smiled. “Yeah, okay. That’s not going to work on me.” I rolled my eyes as I poured some juice for us in a glass and sat down across from her. I slid the glass across the table. “Juice?” I asked. “Thank you. Now tell me what’s going on.” “Nothing is going on, Julia. Why do you keep insisting something is?” She put her elbows on the table as she slid the glass of juice back to me. “Because, I know you and I know the look on your face when something happens. You can’t fool me.” I sighed. “Fine. I sent a text to Hailey and she told me to move on and that she’s met someone.” “Aw, Collin, I’m sorry.” “Sorry about what?” my dad asked as he strolled into the kitchen with a big smile on his face. I looked at Julia and discreetly shook my head. “Oh, nothing, Dad. I was just telling him that I was sorry about Jacob’s illness.” “Ah, yes. It’s a terrible thing. It’s good to see you, princess.” He smiled as he kissed her head. “Are you two almost ready to go to dinner?” I looked at him in confusion. “Dinner? I have plans tonight, Dad,” I said. “Tell that to your mother, son.” “Tell me what?” my mom asked as she walked into the kitchen. “Collin has something he’d like to tell you.” My dad smiled as he raised his eyebrow at me. “What’s wrong?” Damn it. I could never say no when it came to her. “Nothing’s wrong, Mom. I was just telling Dad that I can’t wait for all of us to go and have a nice dinner. It’s been a while.” “Oh good. I was afraid you had already had plans for tonight.” She smiled. “Well, I do, but not until later. Is Jake coming with us?” I asked Julia. “No, he had to go help his dad with something at the dealership.” I looked at my watch. “Great, let’s go. I’m starving.” I smiled, trying to hurry them up so I could go the party after. I didn’t want to be too late. “Are you in some sort of a hurry, son?” my dad smirked. “Uh, no. I’m just really hungry.” I smiled as we walked onto the elevator. Chapter 6 I kissed Julia and my mom goodbye before leaving the restaurant. Since my dad brought the Range Rover, I had to take a cab to Tina’s house. “It’s about time, man.” Aiden smiled as we high-fived. “Sorry. I had to have dinner with my family. You know how my parents are about family dinners.” “Yeah, I sure do. Come on; let’s get our drink on and party!” he screeched. We walked inside and straight to the kitchen, where Tina and a few of our friends were gathered around the table doing lemon drops. “Collin, get your sweet ass over here and do some shots with us!” Tina exclaimed. I needed to forget about Hailey once and for all. Okay, I probably wouldn’t forget about her for good, but at least for tonight, I would after I got rip-roaring drunk. I picked up a lemon drop and held it up. “Fuck relationships!” I said as I threw the shot down the back of my throat.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/collin-forever-4/page-9.html","bookId":1817,"book":{"id":1817,"title":"Collin (Forever #4)","description":"Storyline: The Forever Trilogy hasn\u0027t ended yet...now it\u0027s time for Connor \u0026 Ellery\u0027s son to tell his story...
