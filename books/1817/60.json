So, let’s keep our little vacation under wraps.” “Ah. Okay. My lips are sealed.” “Anyway, it was great seeing you, sweetheart,” she said as she kissed my cheek. “And it was great to meet you, Amelia. You’ve changed my boy here. I can tell already.” “Have a great trip,” I said as we headed down the hall. “She seems really nice,” Amelia said. “She is. She’s one of the best in the company.” We went to dinner that night and, as soon as we got back to the hotel, I ordered a bottle of champagne and we drank and had sex all night long. My dad sent the plane to Chicago for us and we went back to New York. Amelia’s break was over and she went back to her classes and clinicals the next day. As soon as we got home, my mom and dad came down to see us. “I’m really happy the two of you worked things out,” my dad said. “Me too, Dad. Me too.” “How weird was it that you were both going to Chicago at the same time and on the same flight? The universe works in mysterious ways. I’ve learned that over the years. By the way, I’m starting to interview people tomorrow for Diana’s position and I want you to sit in on them.” “Why?” “Because you’re a great judge of character and I want your opinion.” “Thanks, Dad. I’ll be there early tomorrow right after I drop Amelia off at the hospital.” “Ellery, are you ready to go home? I believe you have a promise to keep.” He smiled. She looked at him and bit down on her bottom lip. “You’re right, sexy. I do. I hope you can handle me.” “That’s it! Out. You two can take your little sex talk out of my apartment. I don’t want to hear about you two handling each other.” My parents both laughed and kissed me and Amelia good bye. I rolled my eyes and shook my head. “I absolutely love your parents.” She smiled as she put her arm around me. “As crazy as they can be, I do too.” My mom and dad threw a going-away party for Diana at the Waldorf Astoria. The entire company was invited and I think just about everyone showed. They were all a bunch of suck-ups to my dad, so it didn’t surprise me. We mixed and mingled and I could tell Diana was a little upset. “What’s wrong?” I asked as I walked up to her. “It’s nothing. I’m just going to miss you all. It’s a little scary starting somewhere new.” I put my arm around her and gave her a light squeeze. “I know, but think of how much better you and Jacob will be. And it’s not like you won’t know anyone there. You have Mason and Landon.” “I know and I’ve been talking to Joel almost every day, either on the phone or Skype.” I looked at her strangely. “Really?” “Yeah. He’s a great and interesting guy. We have a lot in common.” She smiled. “Really?” I asked again. “Why do you look so shocked?” “I don’t know. He is a great guy and his wife passed away a couple of years ago.” “We’ve talked about her and my husband.” I got the feeling that she and Joel might have started something or would start something when she got to California. The next afternoon, I picked Amelia up from her classes and we headed to the airport to say goodbye to Diana and Jacob. I’d been dreading this day since she agreed to move to California. My mom and dad were already there and so were Julia and Jake. I walked up to Jacob and knelt down in front of him as I placed my hands on his shoulders. “Hey, buddy. I want you listen to me. Okay?” “Yeah, sure, Collin. What’s up?” “I want you to have the best life in California. Really take in that ocean air. I’ll be coming out to visit you quite a bit and to check up on you. This is a new start for you and your mom and you’re going to need to be there to help her out. Mason will be around a lot and I just know you’re going to do great,” I said as my eyes instantly filled with tears. “I’m going to miss you, Collin.” I pulled him into an embrace. “I’m going to miss you too. We’ll keep in touch almost every day through phone calls and text, and whenever you want, we can Skype.” “Okay,” he said as a tear fell from his eye. I gave him one last squeeze and then patted him on the head. “Go on. Get out of here and go meet some hot California girls.” I smiled. He smiled and held up his fist. I bumped mine against his and stood up and said goodbye to Diana with a hug and a kiss. “Stay in touch and enjoy California. Amelia and I will be out soon to visit.” “Thank you, Collin. I will never forget what you’ve done for us. This isn’t goodbye. I’ll see you later.” She smiled. They walked to the plane and, before Jacob got on, he stopped and waved at me. Amelia put her arm around my waist and laid her head on my shoulder as we both waved goodbye. Chapter 37 Two Months Later “Baby, are you ready? The plane is waiting for us.” “I’m coming. I’m sorry. I had trouble deciding what to bring,” she said. I had to go to Vegas for a business meeting and we decided to make a long weekend of it. Amelia had never been to Vegas and she was really excited to go. “Have you ever gambled?” I asked her as we sat on the plane. “No. But I can’t wait to.” She smiled. “If you have any addictions, gambling could become a problem. So you better be careful.” “Hmm. I do have one addiction: you.” She growled as she kissed me. She had me hard and we were going to be landing in about ten minutes. “You’re a very bad girl, Miss Gray, and as soon as we get to the hotel, I’m afraid I’ll have to punish you.” “Only if you promise to punish me hard.” She smiled. “Jesus, Amelia. You’re killing me,” I said as I kissed the side of her head and buckled my seatbelt. She giggled. We arrived at The Bellagio Hotel and I had to get ready for my business meeting. As I was in the bathroom, Amelia threw herself onto the king-sized bed. “I thought you were going to punish me?” “I am. After my meeting. I promise you I won’t be gone long. The meeting should only take an hour. I’ve booked a massage and facial for you down at the spa.”","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/collin-forever-4/page-60.html","bookId":1817,"book":{"id":1817,"title":"Collin (Forever #4)","description":"Storyline: The Forever Trilogy hasn\u0027t ended yet...now it\u0027s time for Connor \u0026 Ellery\u0027s son to tell his story...
