It seemed that she had everything packed and ready to go. I walked over to a desk that sat in the corner of the living room. It was an antique and my mom would love it. I picked up a picture of her and a guy. I assumed it was her boyfriend. They looked really happy, like Hailey and I once did. Such a tragedy and such loss for someone so young. I had a feeling that she would tell me more in time. I set the picture down and walked back to the foyer. “I’m ready.” She smiled. “You look great.” “Thank you,” she said shyly. Chapter 14 I drove us to Deep Hollow Ranch to go horseback riding. My mom and dad took me and Julia there when we were kids. I hadn’t been there in a few years because Hailey didn’t like horseback riding. I wanted to share this with Amelia and I hoped that she would enjoy it. “A ranch?” she asked as we pulled up the dirt road. “I hope you like horses.” “I love horses, but I’ve never been on one.” I looked over at her when she said that. “You’ve never been horseback riding?” “No. I spent my life in and on the water.” “Well, today’s your lucky day because you’re going horseback riding.” “Can I ask you one favor?” she asked. “Sure. What is it?” “Would it be okay if I rode with you instead of my own horse? I’m a little nervous.” “Of course. I was going to suggest that.” She smiled as she opened the door and got out. I watched her as she took in a deep breath of fresh air. I looked straight ahead as Murray walked towards us. “Well, well, well. Collin Black. I haven’t seen you in years, buddy,” he said as we lightly hugged. “Murray. Good to see you, friend. This is Amelia.” I smiled. “Nice to meet you, Amelia,” he said. “You riding the horses today?” “We sure are. But only one horse. Amelia’s never been horseback riding, so she’s going to ride with me first.” “Follow me to the stable. I’ll set you up with Majestic. She’ll be perfect for you.” We followed him to the stable and he took Majestic from her stall. Murray saddled her up and I climbed on first. Amelia looked a little nervous as she stared at the horse. “Come here, sweetheart,” Murray said. “Make friends with her first if it’ll make you feel better. Talk to her and pet her. You’ll feel more comfortable.” Amelia walked to the front of Majestic and started petting her. She ran her hand down her mane and said hi to her. I looked down at her and smiled as she looked up at me. “Are you ready?” I asked. “Yeah. I think so.” She put her foot in the stirrup as I helped her onto the horse. She sat behind me and I told her to hold on. The minute she wrapped her arms around me, a feeling overtook me that I’d never felt before. I couldn’t describe it. We rode along the shoreline of the white sanded beach. It was breathtaking and I missed this. I was happy to be able to share this with Amelia. “Collin, this is beautiful,” she said. “Isn’t it? I’ve really missed this.” “Why did you stop coming here?” she asked. “My ex-girlfriend hated horseback riding and she would never come.” “She really missed out.” The smile never left my face as the light wind swept across us as we rode down the beach. I took it slow and easy with Majestic because I didn’t want to frighten Amelia. After about an hour, I thought Amelia would like to take over. “How about we switch spots and you take over?” I said as I stopped the horse. “Really?” she asked with excitement. I got off the horse and told Amelia to scoot up. She had a smile on her face that I’d never forget. Her blue eyes were full of light and happiness. It was the first time since we met that I saw her like this. I climbed back on behind her and told her to grab hold of the reins. I told her what to do and then I placed my hands on her hips. She looked back at me and smiled as Majestic started walking. “Oh my God.” She laughed. “This is amazing. I love horseback riding. Thank you, Collin. Thank you for this.” “I’m happy you’re enjoying it and you’re welcome.” We rode for about another hour. I grabbed the reins and I told her to hold on. “Let’s go, Majestic!” I yelled. The horse began to gallop and I yelled, “Woohoo!” Amelia held onto my arms tightly. “Are you okay?” I asked. “I’m great. This is great.” She smiled as she turned her head and looked at me. We rode back to the ranch. As I climbed off, I grabbed Amelia’s hand and helped her down. “Well, what did you think?” Murray asked as he walked up to us. “I loved it!” Amelia replied. “Good. That’s what I like to hear.” I shook Murray’s hand and he told me not to be a stranger. He also told me to send my mom and dad over to the ranch for a visit. We walked back to the car and the clouds started to roll in. “It looks like it’s going to rain,” I said. “Let’s get to the restaurant before it starts.” “Restaurant?” she said. “Don’t tell me you’re not hungry.” “Actually, I am.” She smiled. “Good. Me too. I’m taking you to my favorite place.” We were seated at a quiet little corner table at Nick and Toni’s. As Amelia looked over the menu, she asked me what was good. “They have the best chicken here with the best roasted garlic potatoes I’ve ever eaten.” She laughed. “I love chicken, so I think that’s what I’ll have.” The waitress brought us each a glass of wine and took our order. I looked at Amelia as I held my glass up to her. “Here’s to an amazing and fun day.” “Amazing is right.” She smiled as she brought her glass up to mine. “Can I have your phone number?” I blurted out. She looked at me while she bit down on her bottom lip. “Are you going to call me sometime?” “I was planning on it, but only if you want me to.” She didn’t say anything for a moment and she just looked at me from across the table. “Yeah, I would like you to.”","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/collin-forever-4/page-20.html","bookId":1817,"book":{"id":1817,"title":"Collin (Forever #4)","description":"Storyline: The Forever Trilogy hasn\u0027t ended yet...now it\u0027s time for Connor \u0026 Ellery\u0027s son to tell his story...
