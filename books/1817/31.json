I walked her up to her apartment, put my hands on her hips, and softly kissed her goodbye. “I had a nice time tonight,” I said.\n “Me too.” She smiled.\n I pulled her into me and embraced her. Her scent was driving me insane and I started to get a hard-on. She broke our embrace and looked at me.\n “I’m sorry,” I said. “I can’t help it when I’m with you.”\n Amelia laughed. “It’s okay. I understand, Collin. You don’t need to apologize.”\n “I better go. You have studying to do and I need to leave.”\n “Thanks for dinner. Next time, it’s on me.” She smiled.\n I leaned over and lightly touched her lips with mine. “Never. I will always pay.” I winked as I walked out.\n I heard her giggling behind me as she shut the door. I smiled all the way back to the Range Rover.\n Over the next few days, Amelia and I saw each other after she finished her clinicals. I would pick her up and we’d grab carryout from somewhere and take it back to her place. I would bring my laptop and do some work while she sat and did her homework. I even helped her study for a big quiz she had coming up. She wanted to make sure she finished all her studying before we left for the beach house. I could tell that she was getting closer to me and letting me in more. We talked about our childhoods and how we grew up. We shared family stories and she even talked a little bit about Billy.\n We were both sitting on the couch. I had my laptop on my lap and she was sitting next to me with her nose in her textbook. When she closed it, she looked at me and smiled.\n “Well, that’s it. I’m all finished. Now I’ll have a clear mind for the weekend.”\n “That’s great,” I said as I set my laptop to the side and pulled her into me. I softly kissed the top of her head. “I’m so happy that you’re coming with us.”\n “Me too. Is anyone else coming besides your family?”\n “I think just Peyton and Henry.”\n “Aren’t they the parents of your ex-girlfriend?”\n “Yeah.”\n “You don’t think it will be uncomfortable having your girlfriend there while they’re there.”\n Instantly, I smiled. We had never talked about girlfriend/boyfriend status before. “Nah, it’ll be fine. Peyton and Henry are really cool.”\n My phone buzzed on the table. Amelia sat up and reached over to grab it. There was a text message from Jacob.\n “Guess what. Your dad invited me and my mom to the beach house. How cool is that, dude?”\n I laughed as I replied, “That’s awesome, buddy. I can’t wait to see you.”\n “It’s going to be so cool. I can’t wait.”\n “Are you coming up tomorrow or Saturday?”\n “My mom said we can’t leave until Saturday because I have a doctor’s appointment tomorrow after she gets off work.”\n “That’s okay. You see your doctor first. That’s more important. See ya Saturday, little buddy.”\n “That was Jacob. My dad invited him and Diana to the beach house.”\n “Cool. I can’t wait to finally meet them.” She smiled.\n I stared into her eyes and placed my hand on her cheek. “So, you’re my girlfriend?” I asked with a smile.\n She bit down on her bottom lip before answering me. “So, you’re my boyfriend?”\n I chuckled as I kissed her. “I am.”\n “Then I’m your girlfriend.” She smiled as she wrapped her arms around my neck.\n “So it’s official.”\n “It’s official,” she said.\n I wanted nothing more than to make love to her at that moment, but I knew she wasn’t ready yet and I was more than willing to wait until she was.\n “Since we’re leaving in the morning and you don’t have classes or clinicals, why don’t you spend the night at the penthouse and we can leave together.”\n “Really? Your mom and dad wouldn’t mind?”\n “Not at all.”\n “Maybe you better ask first.”\n I raised my eyebrow at her. “Seriously? You want me to ask?”\n “Yes. They’re your parents and it’s their penthouse. So, out of respect, it would be best to ask them.”\n “You’re right,” I said as I sent a text message to my mom.\n “Can Amelia spend the night in the guest room since we’re leaving in the morning?”\n “Great idea. She’s more than welcome to spend the night here.”\n I looked at her and showed her my phone. “See, I told you they wouldn’t care.”\n She smiled at me and got up to pack her bag for the weekend. “Can I help you with anything?” I asked.\n “No, it will only take me a minute. Oh, can you grab my charger out of the desk drawer?”\n I got up from the couch and, when I opened the drawer, there was a picture of her, her dad, and her sister in front of T-Rex Sue. I pulled it out and, as I was looking at it, she walked up behind me.\n “That’s Sue,” she said over my shoulder.\n “I know,” I said as I pulled out my phone and brought up the picture that I took at the Field Museum.\n “Hey, you have a picture of Sue too!” She smiled.\n “That’s one of my most favorite museums,” I said.\n “Mine too. My dad took us there about four years ago for the first time and I loved it.”\n “I’ll take you back there and we can get a picture of us in front of her.” I smiled.\n “I would love that,” she said as she kissed my lips.\n She was becoming more and more perfect to me and she was fitting perfectly into my world. I loved sharing the museum with Diana and Jacob, but to share it with someone I was falling in love with would be even more amazing. I pushed a few strands of hair behind her ear and placed my finger under her chin.\n “You’re perfect.”\n “No, I’m not. Nobody’s perfect.”\n “Well, as true as that may be, you’re perfect to me.” I smiled.\n Our lips met once again and, this time, it was more than a small kiss. It was comforting and passionate. I inched her backwards until she was leaning against the wall. I placed my hand above her head while our lips moved together in sync. I kept my other hand firmly planted on her hip so it didn’t wander where it wanted to go. My tongue left her mouth and, as it softly explored her neck, she let out a moan that sent me over the edge. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/collin-forever-4/page-31.html","bookId":1817,"book":{"id":1817,"title":"Collin (Forever #4)","description":"Storyline: \n The Forever Trilogy hasn\u0027t ended yet...now it\u0027s time for Connor \u0026 Ellery\u0027s son to tell his story... \n I’d like to introduce myself.
