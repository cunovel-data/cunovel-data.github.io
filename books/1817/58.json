Actually, he left me in Michigan, alone in a hotel room, and made me fly back to New York by myself.”\\n\\n “Wow. Seriously?”\\n\\n “Yes. But I hurt him on such a deep level that I didn’t think I’d ever see him again. What I did was unforgiveable. But Connor loved me so much that he forgave me eventually. My point is that people make mistakes.”\\n\\n “I know that, Ellery, but he can’t think he can just buy my parents’ house because I needed the money. I felt like such a charity case, and then, for him not to tell me. That right there proves he knew what he was doing wasn’t right.”\\n\\n “Ah, I know the feeling. But you’re not a charity case. He wanted you to have that house to hold on to the memory of your family. He wanted to give you a piece of them. Don’t you think he would have just given you some money? He knew you needed it, but he didn’t offer to give you any while the house was up for sale, did he?”\\n\\n Amelia shook her head. “No, he didn’t.”\\n\\n “If you haven’t figured it out yet, my son is a very giving person. He’s the spitting image of his father.”\\n\\n “I noticed that.” She smiled.\\n\\n I took hold of her hand from across the table. “Running away doesn’t solve anything. Trust me. I’m not defending him, but I think you need to hear him out and he needs to hear you out. He loves you, Amelia. I’ve never seen him so happy.”\\n\\n “Thank you, Ellery.”\\n\\n “You’re welcome, sweetie. You know I’ll always be here for you.”\\n\\n Chapter 35\\n\\n The day seemed to drag on forever. I stared out the window of my office and thought about Amelia. She never responded to my text message from earlier. I really fucked things up and I missed her like crazy. My heart was hurting, and every time I thought about her, it broke just a little more. Since she was constantly on my mind, there wasn’t going to be a heart left in me at all. I needed to get out of New York for a couple of days, so I called the airlines, booked a flight to Chicago, and went home and packed a bag for the weekend. I didn’t want to ask my dad to use the plane. It was less complicated just to book a commercial flight.\\n\\n I boarded the plane and took my seat in coach. I didn’t care because first class and business class were booked up and I just wanted to get on this plane out of New York. A few moments later, an older woman took the seat next to me.\\n\\n “Hello. My, you are a handsome young man.” She smiled.\\n\\n “Hi, and thank you.” I smiled back and then turned my attention to the window. As I was watching some of the other planes take off, I heard a familiar voice.\\n\\n “Damn it. Why can’t I get this to fit up here?”\\n\\n I turned my head and saw Amelia trying to stuff her bag in the overhead compartment.\\n\\n “What the—” I said.\\n\\n She looked at me and shock overtook her face. “What are you doing here?” she asked with an attitude.\\n\\n “Flying to Chicago. What about you?”\\n\\n “Same.”\\n\\n I couldn’t fucking believe this. Amelia took her seat next to the lady who sat next to me and looked the opposite way. I stared out the window as the plane took off from the runway and into the sky. As soon as I could use my phone, I pulled it from my pocket and sent Amelia a text message.\\n\\n “Why are you going to Chicago?”\\n\\n I saw her look at her phone and then type a message back.\\n\\n “Why are you?”\\n\\n “Don’t answer a question with a question.”\\n\\n “I can do what I want.”\\n\\n “Answer my question.”\\n\\n “No.”\\n\\n “Damn it, Amelia,” I said as I looked over at her.\\n\\n “Don’t swear at me,” she growled.\\n\\n The poor lady who was sitting between us looked at us in confusion. “Would you like to switch seats?” she asked Amelia.\\n\\n “No.”\\n\\n Amelia looked over at me. “Why are you in coach anyway? Shouldn’t you be on your dad’s plane or at least in first class?”\\n\\n “First class was booked and I didn’t ask to use the plane. I just wanted to get out of New York as soon as possible.”\\n\\n The lady next to me got up and went to the restroom. Amelia sat there, looking straight ahead while I looked out the window. When the lady came back, she stood in the middle of the aisle.\\n\\n “Excuse me, young lady, but you need to move over because I’m having bathroom issues and it would be more convenient for me to sit on the end seat instead of having to climb over you.”\\n\\n Amelia looked at her and narrowed her eyes. She sighed and sat in the seat next to me.\\n\\n “Thank you, my dear,” the lady said.\\n\\n “I can’t believe you’re on this plane,” Amelia said through gritted teeth.\\n\\n “I can’t believe you are.”\\n\\n “Isn’t it funny how fate works?” The old lady smiled.\\n\\n Amelia put her earphones in and I laid my head against the window and closed my eyes. Suddenly, the plane dropped and began shaking. Amelia grabbed my arm.\\n\\n “Put on your seatbelt,” I said to her.\\n\\n “I don’t want to let go,” she said with fear in her eyes.\\n\\n I reached over and buckled her seatbelt and then mine. The captain came on and apologized that we were experiencing some turbulence and would be for a little while longer. It was a bit unsettling, but with the amount of flying that I did, I was used to it. I wanted to bring her on my lap and hold her tight and tell her that everything was going to be okay. I looked over at the lady sitting next to Amelia and asked her if she was okay. She smiled and nodded her head. The turbulence had settled and Amelia let go of my arm. She put her earphones back in and acted like nothing happened.\\n\\n “No. You don’t get to do that,” I said as I took her earphones out of her ears.\\n\\n “What the hell are you doing?” she snapped.\\n\\n “You don’t get to hold on to me for dear life because you’re scared and then ignore me. You know what? Forget I said anything. I’m sorry. You go on with your business and I’ll go on with mine.”\\n\\n “Oh no, mister. You started this and we’re going to talk about it.”\\n\\n “I don’t want to talk to you anymore. Go back to listening to your music,” I snapped. “And for the record, I did nothing wrong but love you. Maybe more than I should have.”\\n\\n “You made me feel like a charity case.”\\n\\n “How did I do that?” I asked. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/collin-forever-4/page-58.html","bookId":1817,"book":{"id":1817,"title":"Collin (Forever #4)","description":"Storyline: The Forever Trilogy hasn\u0027t ended yet...now it\u0027s time for Connor \u0026 Ellery\u0027s son to tell his story... \\n I’d like to introduce myself.
