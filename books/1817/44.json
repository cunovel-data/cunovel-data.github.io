I sighed as Amelia looked at me. “Why is she calling you?” “Probably because I blew her off today.” “What? What the hell are you talking about?” “She sent me a text this morning and asked me if we could talk because she told her parents about the baby and they were really upset.” “So she has to talk to you about it?” Amelia asked with a little bit of an attitude. “Baby, listen. Don’t you worry about Hailey. You know I love you. I’m just trying to be nice, I guess. Which I’m not sure if I should be. “She’s going to get the wrong impression, Collin.” “Well, if she does, I’ll set her straight. No big deal. Now come on; help me pick out a bed.” I winked. I bought all the furniture I needed. It was fun shopping with Amelia. She and I had the same taste in furniture. We picked up Thai food on the way back to my apartment and we set a blanket on the floor as we ate with chopsticks out of the carton, talking and laughing about life. “Go ahead and call Hailey back. Meet with her tomorrow and let her talk. I’m okay with it,” Amelia said. “Are you sure? Because I don’t have to if it’s going to upset you.” “It won’t upset me. Just do it.” I grabbed my phone and dialed Hailey’s number. She answered on the second ring and we arranged to meet at Starbucks tomorrow morning around ten. I looked at Amelia and smiled. “Can you stay here for a second? I have to run across the hall.” “Sure.” She giggled. I got up and stepped across the hall to Julia’s apartment. I softly knocked and Jake answered the door. “Hey, neighbor. What’s up?” “Do you have a couple extra blankets I can borrow for a couple nights? I don’t want to go upstairs and be interrogated by the parents.” “HAHA!” Jake laughed. “Sure, we have extra blankets. Come on in.” Julia came walking from the bedroom and smiled when she saw me. Oh my God, did she look huge in her nightgown. But I didn’t dare say anything. “What are you doing here, handsome?” she asked as she kissed my cheek. “Your little brother is spending the night at his new pad and he asked to borrow a couple of blankets. I’m thinking he may be having a sleepover.” Jake smiled. “Oh, really? Is that true?” Julia asked. “Yes. Amelia is spending the night,” I said as I took the blankets from Jake. “Have fun!” Julia said as I opened the door. I turned around and smiled at her. “To quote Dad, I fully intend to.” Julia covered her ears. “Stop that! And you better wash those blankets before you give them back!” I laughed as I shut the door, walked over to my place, laid down the blankets in the bedroom, and made sweet love to my girl again. Chapter 27 I looked at my watch. It was ten fifteen. I sat there with my cup of coffee and looked out the window to see if I could see Hailey walking down the street. I pulled out my phone and sent her a text message. “Hey, where are you? I have to get back to work.” I sat and waited for another ten minutes and there was no Hailey and no reply text message. I sighed as I got up from the table and my phone began to ring. I thought it was strange that Amelia was calling me during her clinicals. “Hey, baby. Is something wrong?” “Collin, I’m doing clinicals in the Labor and Delivery unit and Hailey is here. I saw her, and her mom asked me to call you.” “Is she okay?” “She lost the baby. I really think you should come to the hospital.” “Thanks, baby. I’m on my way. I love you.” “I love you too. See you soon.” Oh, man. I couldn’t believe she lost the baby. I drove to the hospital and went up to the Labor and Delivery unit. The nurse at the desk told me which room Hailey was in and, when I went there, Peyton and Henry were in the room with her. “Hi, Collin. You’re so sweet for coming,” Peyton said as she hugged me. “Hi, Collin. Thanks, man,” Henry said as he walked over and shook my hand. They both left the room and I walked over to the side of Hailey’s bed and sat down in the chair. She wouldn’t look at me. She just stared at the blank wall. “Hey, Hailey.” “Hey,” she whispered as she wiped a tear that fell from her eye. “I’m sorry about the baby.” “I’m not. Why are you here?” she asked as she turned and looked at me. “Your mom asked me to come.” “That’s just fucking great. I’m asking you to leave.” “Why?” “Because I don’t want you here. You’re the last person I want to see.” “Really, Hailey? Because yesterday, you wanted to talk,” I said. “That was then, this is now, and now I don’t want to see you. I needed you when I came back and you turned your back on me.” I was getting angrier by the minute. I couldn’t yell at her because she had just lost the baby and she was emotional. I got up from the chair and placed my hand on hers. “I hope you feel better, Hailey.” I walked out of the room and saw Amelia down the hall. I walked over to her and grabbed her hand. “I know you’re busy, so I’ll see you later. Okay?” “Okay. Are you all right?” she asked. “I’m perfectly fine, baby,” I said as I kissed her forehead and went to the office. A couple of weeks had passed and Amelia and I spent them going out with friends and organizing all the things my mom bought me for my apartment. I sent Ralph to pick up Amelia from the hospital because I was making dinner for her. I heard the door open and, instantly, I smiled. I wiped my hands on the kitchen towel and walked to the foyer. “Hi, baby,” I said as I kissed her. “Did you have a nice ride home with Ralphie?” She smiled and then let out a giggle. “Be nice. It smells wonderful in here.” “Thank you. How was your day?” I asked. “It was good. How was yours?” “It’s better now that you’re here.” I smiled as I gripped her hips and kissed her. There was a knock at the door and Amelia looked at me. “Are you expecting someone?”","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/collin-forever-4/page-44.html","bookId":1817,"book":{"id":1817,"title":"Collin (Forever #4)","description":"Storyline: The Forever Trilogy hasn\u0027t ended yet...now it\u0027s time for Connor \u0026 Ellery\u0027s son to tell his story...
