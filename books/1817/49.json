Also, I want our company to start hosting charity events for cystic fibrosis. After all these years, you never branched out from the autism charities.”\\n\\n He leaned back in his chair with his hands behind his head. “Now that is a great idea. I’ll have Barb get started on that.”\\n\\n “Thanks, Dad.” I smiled.\\n\\n “I’ll give some serious thought to your proposal and get back with you in a couple of days.”\\n\\n “Okay,” I said as I got up from my chair.\\n\\n “By the way, have you told Amelia yet about the house you purchased?” he asked.\\n\\n “No.”\\n\\n “Son.”\\n\\n “I know, Dad. I will, don’t worry.”\\n\\n I told him not to worry when it was constantly a worry on my mind. As I walked out of the building into the freezing cold, my phone rang.\\n\\n “Hi, Mom.”\\n\\n “Hi, sweetheart. I’m having family dinner tonight and I expect you and Amelia to be here. I know it’s last minute, but I just decided it. Julia, Jake, and the baby will be here. So if you have plans, cancel them, and I’ll see you around six.”\\n\\n I didn’t have plans, but even if I did, I would have no choice but to cancel them because what my mom says goes.\\n\\n “We’ll be there, Mom. I love you.”\\n\\n “I love you too, my sweet boy.”\\n\\n As I was walking down the street to Starbucks, I passed the flower shop. I stopped and decided to buy Amelia some roses. It was no special occasion. I just wanted to let her know in another way that I loved her. While I was looking at the beautiful assortment of roses, my phone buzzed with a text message from Amelia.\\n\\n “Hey, babe. Clinicals ended early and I need to stop by the campus library and pick up a book. I’m going to catch a cab with Cheri and then I’ll take one to your place.”\\n\\n “No, Amelia. You and Cheri stay at the hospital. I’ll send Ralph over to pick you both up and then take you where you need to go.”\\n\\n “Are you sure?”\\n\\n “Positive. I’ll see you later. I love you.”\\n\\n “Thank you, babe. I love you too.”\\n\\n I immediately called Ralph and had him pick up the girls. I told the sales clerk that I wanted two dozen red roses. As she was getting them together, I heard a voice behind me.\\n\\n “Fancy seeing you in here.”\\n\\n I turned around. “Hi, Hailey.”\\n\\n “Buying flowers for your girlfriend?” she asked.\\n\\n “Yeah. I am. Why are you here?”\\n\\n “No reason. I just saw you standing here when I was walking by and thought I’d drop in and say hi.”\\n\\n The clerk handed me the roses with a smile and I gave her my credit card. “Well, we’ve said hi and now it’s time to say goodbye.”\\n\\n “I’m leaving for Paris in a couple of days.”\\n\\n “Good for you. You always liked Paris.”\\n\\n “Yeah. Maybe I’ll meet some hot French dude who will sweep me off my feet with his incredible French accent.”\\n\\n “I hope you do, Hailey. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to get going. Good luck.”\\n\\n I began to walk away and stopped when I heard her next words.\\n\\n “Tell me one more thing. Does she make you happier than I ever did?”\\n\\n “Yes. She does,” I said as I closed my eyes and lowered my head.\\n\\n “Then I’m happy you’re happy. See ya around sometime, Collin,” she said as she placed her hand on my back and then walked away.\\n\\n My phone started to ring and, when I pulled it from my pocket, I noticed it was my dad calling.\\n\\n “Hello,” I said.\\n\\n “Where are you?” he asked.\\n\\n “Down the street at the flower shop.”\\n\\n “Good. Do me a favor and pick up some roses for your mom and then you can drive me home since you sent Ralph on an errand.”\\n\\n Oh shit. I forgot he didn’t drive to the office himself. “Okay, Dad. What color roses for Mom?”\\n\\n “Be creative and get a mix of colors. I’ll meet you in the parking garage.”\\n\\n I hung up and walked back up to the counter. The clerk smiled at me.\\n\\n “Sorry, but I need two dozen roses in a variety of colors.”\\n\\n “Sure thing, Mr. Black. This wouldn’t happen to be for your mom, would it?”\\n\\n “Yes.” I smiled.\\n\\n She made up a bouquet of colorful roses and handed them to me. I left the store still thinking about the question Hailey asked me and the sadness in her voice when I answered her. My phone rang. It was my dad again.\\n\\n “Hello,” I answered.\\n\\n “Pick up some pink roses for your sister.”\\n\\n I rolled my eyes and sighed. “Okay, Dad.”\\n\\n I walked back into the flower shop and the woman smiled at me again.\\n\\n “I need two dozen pink roses, please.”\\n\\n “Sister?” She smiled.\\n\\n “Yep.”\\n\\n “Your dad always bought her pink roses. I’ll be right back.”\\n\\n She handed me the roses and, before I left the store, I dialed my dad.\\n\\n “Hello, son.”\\n\\n “Before I leave the flower shop, is there anyone else you want flowers for?”\\n\\n “No. Just your mom and Julia. I’m assuming you went there to buy Amelia flowers, correct?”\\n\\n “Yes.”\\n\\n “Then you’re all set. Hurry up and get back here.”\\n\\n “I’m on my way,” I said as I hung up.\\n\\n I stepped into the apartment and Amelia came from the direction of the kitchen. The corners of her mouth curved up when she saw the roses I was holding.\\n\\n “Are those for me?” She smiled.\\n\\n “No. Some girl at the office gave them to me.”\\n\\n The look on her face was priceless. She stood there and narrowed her eyes at me.\\n\\n “What girl?”\\n\\n “I don’t know. She’s new. Anyway, she told me she loved me and then gave me these. Aren’t they pretty?”\\n\\n “She told you that she loved you?”\\n\\n “Yeah. Isn’t that weird? I was totally flattered and she was really hot. But I guess if you want the flowers, you can have them.” I smiled.\\n\\n “NO THANKS!” she said in a huff and walked away.\\n\\n Okay, maybe I took that a little too far. Now I needed to make things right. “Of course these are for you, baby. I was just teasing.”\\n\\n “Go away, Collin. In fact, I’m just going to stay at my place tonight.”\\n\\n Oh shit. What the fuck had I done? \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/collin-forever-4/page-49.html","bookId":1817,"book":{"id":1817,"title":"Collin (Forever #4)","description":"Storyline: The Forever Trilogy hasn\u0027t ended yet...now it\u0027s time for Connor \u0026 Ellery\u0027s son to tell his story... \\n I’d like to introduce myself.
