I could tell by the look in her eyes that she wanted me too. I ran the back of my hand across her cheek as I inched my lips closer to hers. Before I knew it, her soft lips were touching mine. I kissed her softly and then looked at her to make sure she was okay with it. She smiled at me and that was my cue to keep going. I brought my lips to hers once again and, this time, I felt them part, inviting my tongue into her mouth. Our lips moved together in sync and I could feel her smiling from underneath. I broke the kiss before it went any further and stared into her eyes. “I think we should stop. You need to go and study.” “Good idea,” she whispered. I got up, took hold of her hand, and helped her from the bed. “Can I see you again?” I asked. “I would like that very much.” I leaned in and kissed her softly again. “Let’s go. I’ll drive you home.” “Not Ralphie?” she asked. “No. Not Ralphie. Just me and you,” I said. We walked downstairs and Amelia said goodbye to my parents and Julia and Jake. We hopped into the Range Rover and I drove her back to her apartment. “Would you like to come up?” she asked. “As much as I want to, I don’t want to interfere with your studying. So go and get some studying done and promise me you’ll go out with me tomorrow night.” “I promise that I’ll go out with you tomorrow night.” She smiled as she tilted her head. “And I promise my parents won’t be there.” I laughed. “Good night, Mr. Black,” Amelia said as she reached up and brushed her lips against mine. “Good night, Miss Gray,” I responded as our lips locked one last time for the night. As I walked up the stairs to my room, my mom came from her bedroom and stopped me. “I thought I heard you come in.” She smiled. “Thank you for bringing Amelia to dinner tonight. She’s a lovely girl, Collin.” “Yeah, she is. Isn’t she?” She followed me to my room as I set my phone and wallet on my dresser. “Can I tell you something?” she asked. “Sure, Mom. What is it?” I replied as I pulled off my shirt. “You’re reminding me a lot of your dad in his younger years.” “For God’s sake, Ellery, you’re making me sound like I’m an old geezer.” My dad smiled as he stood in the doorway. I looked at my dad and laughed. “You’re not a geezer yet, Dad.” “Connor, I love you, but I’m trying to have a conversation with our son. Go back to bed and I’ll be in there shortly.” “I’ll be waiting anxiously, Elle.” He winked. I rolled my eyes and threw a pillow at him. “Dad, stop!” He chuckled as he threw the pillow back at me and headed to his room. “Mom, is there a point to this conversation?” I asked. “Yes, there is. You have the same qualities as your father and the same amazing heart. Any woman would be a fool not to have you in her life. It takes a very special person to stand by someone through the thick and thin of things. I just want you to remember that I’m here for you when you need to talk. Your father and I have been through so much during our years together and if he wasn’t the man he is, he never would have forgiven me and stuck by me the way he has. Even broken people can be fixed and there’s no need to be frightened about trying to heal them.” I looked at her in confusion. Where the hell was this coming from? Could she see that I had some fears about Amelia? That I felt she was too closed off and burdened with the death of her family and boyfriend that it would cause problems in a relationship? She was my mom and nobody knew me better than she did. “Thanks, Mom.” I smiled as I kissed her on the cheek. “Dad’s waiting for you. Please do me a favor and keep it down.” She laughed as she hugged me. “I’m sorry that we do this to you. Goodnight, baby.” “Goodnight, Mom.” I climbed into bed and as soon as I set my phone on my nightstand, it buzzed with a text message from Julia. “I really like Amelia. I think the two of you are super cute together and I don’t want you to do anything to fuck it up.” “I really like her too. She’s different, Julia. I feel things I never have before.” “I know you do, little brother. I can see it in you.” “I’m a little scared.” “Do I need to come up there and smack you?” I laughed. “I wouldn’t advise that. Mom and Dad are getting it on down the hall. I really need to move out!” “Haha. Better you than me! Put your earplugs in. Night.” I smiled as I set down my phone and pulled the sheet on top of me. As I placed my hands behind my head, I couldn’t stop thinking about Amelia. I couldn’t wait to see her tomorrow. She was starting to consume my every thought and I prayed to God that I consumed hers. Chapter 18 Before I picked up Amelia at her apartment, I stopped and picked up Chinese carryout and a bottle of wine for us. She thought we were going to eat it in her apartment, but I had another plan. It was a beautiful evening and it needed to be spent enjoying it. I walked up to her door and knocked. She opened it with a big smile on her face and invited me in. “Hi.” I smiled as I placed my hands on her hips and lightly kissed her. “Hi.” I looked around the small place she called home and was quite impressed at how cozy it seemed. “You never mentioned a roommate. Do you not have one?” I asked. “I used to have one when I lived in another building. But after the accident, I moved here and I just wanted to be alone. So, to answer your question, no, I don’t have a roommate.” “Well, your apartment is nice. I like it.” I smiled. “Thank you. It’s okay. Did you bring the food?” “I did. But I left it in the car. I decided that we’re going to eat it somewhere else.” “Sounds like you have a plan.” She smiled. “I do. So if you’ll come with me, I’ll show you,” I said as I stuck out my arm. It took us less than five minutes to get to Central Park. I parked the Range Rover and looked over at Amelia as she smiled at me. “Central Park?”","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/collin-forever-4/page-27.html","bookId":1817,"book":{"id":1817,"title":"Collin (Forever #4)","description":"Storyline: The Forever Trilogy hasn\u0027t ended yet...now it\u0027s time for Connor \u0026 Ellery\u0027s son to tell his story...
