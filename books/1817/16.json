What did you say?”\n She stopped and then turned around. “I said, I’m glad to see that you won’t be tripping anyone today.”\n I shook my head. “Sorry, but you must have the wrong person.”\n She laughed and began walking towards me. She was beautiful, especially when she smiled.\n “Nope. You’re the right person,” she said as she walked up to me.\n “I don’t understand. I’m sorry.”\n The wind blew lightly and the faint scent of roses swept across me. The same scent that was on my shirt from last night.\n “You were passed out drunk on the beach last night and I was taking a walk and I tripped over you. So, I’m happy to see that you’re awake and standing here so nobody will trip over you again.”\n I knitted my eyebrows and cocked my head. This girl. This girl that smelled like roses intrigued me.\n “I’m sorry. Are you all right?” I asked.\n “I’m fine. Are you all right?”\n I kicked the sand with my foot as I looked down in embarrassment. “Yeah, I’m okay.”\n “You must have one wicked hangover. You were passed out cold. I was surprised I even managed to get you in the house and up the stairs.”\n “You brought me to my bed?” I asked in confusion.\n “I did. I didn’t think you should spend the night on the beach. Anyway, I have to go. I’m glad you’re up and feeling better.” She smiled as she turned and started jogging away.\n “Wait!” I exclaimed. “Do you live around here?”\n “Corner house, on the left.”\n “Do you have a name? Or should I just call you the girl who tripped over me?” I smiled.\n “My name is Amelia.” She laughed lightly.\n “I’m Collin.” I smiled.\n “Nice to meet you, Collin, aka, the guy who tripped me on the beach.”\n I chuckled as she jogged down the beach. Wow, I thought to myself. What a great girl.\n My phone began to buzz in my hand. I looked at it and there was a text message from Aiden.\n “Bro, I met the most fantastic girl. Going out with her tonight, if you want to tag along.”\n “Nah, have fun. I think I’m going to stay in tonight.”\n I walked back up to the beach house and I couldn’t stop thinking about Amelia. Her smile and her scent stayed with me and I thought about her for the rest of the day. I needed to pick up a few things from the store, so I hopped into the Range Rover and drove to the local market.\n My phone buzzed with a text message from Aiden.\n “Are you sure you don’t want to come out with us tonight?”\n “Yeah, I’m sure,” I texted back.\n I wasn’t paying attention and ran into the cart that was in front of me.\n “Oh my God, I’m sorry,” I said as I looked up and saw Amelia staring at me.\n “First you trip me on the beach and now you practically run me over with your cart in the grocery store,” she said.\n “I am so sorry.” I began to laugh. “I was texting my friend and I didn’t see you.”\n “Of course you didn’t see me. You had your eyes focused on your phone and not what’s straight ahead of you. If you’re going to text while pushing the cart, at least stop and text.”\n She liked to go on little rants. She made me smile and no one had done that in a very long time.\n “I’m glad I ran into you, literally.” I chuckled. “I want to thank you for thinking enough of me to not let me spend the night on the beach. Don’t get me wrong, I’m all for spending the night on the beach, under the stars. Just not passed out drunk. I was hoping that you’d have dinner with me.”\n She looked at me and her eyes diverted down. “I’m sorry. I can’t.”\n “Why?” I asked in confusion.\n “Because I just can’t,” she said as she began pushing her cart down the aisle.\n I grabbed my cart and caught up with her. “Oh, I see; your husband or boyfriend wouldn’t approve.”\n “I don’t have a husband or boyfriend.”\n Whew, I thought to myself. She’s single. That’s good. “Then why can’t you?”\n She stopped her basket and turned and looked at me. “Look, Collin, you seem like a really nice guy, but I’m not interested.”\n Okay, she’s not interested. That’s impossible. “Okay, so you’re not interested. I’m not interested either. All I want to do is thank you for helping me into the house last night and to apologize to you for hitting you with my cart.” I smiled. “I don’t understand why women think that when a guy asks them to dinner, they automatically think we’re interested.”\n “Because, men usually are,” she said with a twisted face.\n “Well, not me. I think you’re a nice girl and all I want to do is thank you. What’s the big deal with that? Am I trying to have sex with you? No way. Do I want a relationship with you? No way. Would I like to show my gratitude as a new friend? Yes way.”\n She stood there and stared at me while she chewed on her bottom lip. She was trying to figure me out.\n “Okay, fine. I’ll have dinner with you.”\n “Okay. Thank you. How about I cook for you at my house? I’m really not up for going out tonight.”\n “Sounds good to me because I’m not up for going out either. Maybe I can help you cook.”\n “No. I’ll cook for you. Remember, it’s my thank you.”\n “Fine.” She smiled. “How about I bring dessert?”\n “I would like that.” I smiled back. “Do you eat meat?”\n “Yes, I eat meat.”\n “Good, because I’m going to cook us some steaks. Do you have any food allergies?”\n “No.” She laughed.\n “Don’t laugh. At the rate I’m going with you, I would probably cook something that you’re allergic to and I’d send you into anaphylactic shock.”\n “Don’t worry. I’m not allergic to anything.”\n “Okay then. I’ll finish up shopping and see you at my place around seven?”\n “I’ll see you then, Collin.”\n We smiled at each other as our carts went the opposite way. I smiled all the way through the store. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/collin-forever-4/page-16.html","bookId":1817,"book":{"id":1817,"title":"Collin (Forever #4)","description":"Storyline: \n The Forever Trilogy hasn\u0027t ended yet...now it\u0027s time for Connor \u0026 Ellery\u0027s son to tell his story... \n I’d like to introduce myself.
