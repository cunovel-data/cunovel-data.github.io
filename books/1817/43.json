We talked about it not too long ago when I asked her how things were going. She told me that she was really sad that she had to sell it because she wanted it to be a place where she could go and feel close to her family every summer. You are so much like your father, Collin. I see more and more of him in you every day.” She smiled as she brought her hand up to my face. “Good for you! Are you going to tell her?”\\n\\n “No, not yet. I want to wait until I see how things go with us. Plus, I don’t want her to be mad at me for doing it.”\\n\\n “She’ll think you are the most incredible and giving person on the face of this earth.” She smiled.\\n\\n “Thanks again, Mom. Excuse me. I need to get something to drink,” I said as I walked to the kitchen. I heard my mom raise her voice at my dad and I stood out of sight and listened to their conversation.\\n\\n “As for you, Mister. How the hell could you be mad at your son for doing exactly what you would have done? You should be very proud of him, Connor. You are an amazing father and you taught your son well.”\\n\\n “I am proud of him, Elle. He’s an incredible man. I just wish—”\\n\\n “You wish he would have asked your opinion first, right? You weren’t mad at him for buying that house. You were hurt because your son made a responsible adult purchase on his own. Connor, you’re scared that Collin doesn’t need you any more, aren’t you?”\\n\\n “Yeah, something like that,” he said.\\n\\n I hadn’t stopped to think about my dad’s feelings. He was afraid of letting me go like he was with Julia. Damn, I wished I would have talked to him about it first. I didn’t realize he would feel not needed. As soon as they were finished talking, I walked out to the foyer.\\n\\n “Hey, Dad. I’m sorry about not talking to you before buying the house. I know that I probably should have consulted you first, but I really wanted to do something on my own. I’m sorry.”\\n\\n “Come here, son,” he said as he hugged me. “Don’t be sorry. You’re an adult and you can do whatever you want. Just know that I’m always here for you, no matter what, and I always will be.”\\n\\n “Thanks, Dad.” I smiled.\\n\\n “Now go on and get out of here. Your mom and I have some things to do.” He winked.\\n\\n I shook my head and rolled my eyes. “Have fun.”\\n\\n “Oh, I fully intend to,” he said as he walked up the stairs.\\n\\n I made Amelia close her eyes as I put the key in the lock. I opened the door and took her hand and led her inside.\\n\\n “Okay, you can open your eyes.”\\n\\n “Oh my God! This is amazing,” she said as she looked around the apartment.\\n\\n “I’m happy you like it.” I smiled.\\n\\n She walked through the living room and into the kitchen. I thought she was going to have a heart attack when she saw the dining area and the five large windows that made up one wall.\\n\\n “Oh, the romantic dinners we can have here.” She smiled.\\n\\n I walked over to her and wrapped my arms around her waist. “You’re going to be spending a lot of time here.”\\n\\n “I hope so,” she said as she leaned her head back and I kissed her lips.\\n\\n “Look around. What do you see?” I asked.\\n\\n She escaped from my arms and walked through the apartment, looking up and down and all around. “Hmm...I see nothing but a lot of wall space.”\\n\\n I smiled. “That’s right. Do you know what that means?” I asked as I unbuttoned my pants.\\n\\n She turned around and looked at me as she bit down on her bottom lip with a wide smile across her face. “Lots and lots of wall sex!” she said as she lifted off her shirt.\\n\\n “That’s right. Lots of wall sex, and I think we should start now.” I smiled as I threw my shirt on the floor and took down my pants.\\n\\n She stood in the middle of the empty room, stepping out of her jeans while unhooking her bra and slowing inching backwards until she was up against the wall.\\n\\n “Fuck,” I said as I walked towards her.\\n\\n I was already as hard as a rock and I hadn’t even touched her yet. I took down my underwear as soon as I reached her. I stepped out of them and kicked them to the side as I firmly planted my hands against the wall on each side of her head. I teased her with my lips, kissing her slowly and softly. She wasted no time stroking me up and down slowly, driving me insane. My hand traveled down to her wet pussy and I cupped it before slipping my fingers inside.\\n\\n “Ah, baby, you’re so wet already.”\\n\\n “Mhmm. Only for you,” she whispered.\\n\\n “I need to taste you first,” I moaned as I knelt down and planted my mouth against her, tasting her pleasure.\\n\\n She grabbed my hair and began thrusting her hips back and forth. “Oh God, I’m going to come already!” she yelled.\\n\\n “Do it, baby. I want to hear you and I want to feel you,” I said as my tongue flicked in and out of her rapidly.\\n\\n Her body tightened and swelled against my mouth, releasing the orgasm that I brought her to. “Oh God. Oh God,” she kept yelling.\\n\\n “Are you ready, baby?” I asked.\\n\\n “Yes,” she said with bated breath.\\n\\n I placed my cock inside her and pushed into her with force. She wrapped her legs around me, which caused me to go deeper inside her.\\n\\n “AH!” I moaned from the pleasure I felt.\\n\\n I held her up by her perfect ass and pounded in and out of her. Her tits were shaking all over the place as she begged me to suck them. I slowed down and took her in my mouth, biting and licking her hard nipples like she commanded.\\n\\n “Faster, Collin. Faster. I’m going to come again!” she yelled.\\n\\n I held her up with one hand this time as I pressed my other hand against the wall. I thrust in and out of her as fast as I could, building up for my release. Her moans grew with each thrust and, just as her legs tightened around me, I could feel her come pouring onto me as I released myself deep inside her. Our hearts were racing and we were both out of breath. Once I pushed every last milky drop inside of her, I buried my face into her neck. She brought up her hand to my head and softly stroked my hair.\\n\\n “I love you, Collin.”\\n\\n “I love you too, Amelia. More than you’ll ever know.” I lifted my head and softly kissed her on the lips. “Let’s go furniture shopping, shall we?” I smiled.\\n\\n “I would love to.” She smiled back. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/collin-forever-4/page-43.html","bookId":1817,"book":{"id":1817,"title":"Collin (Forever #4)","description":"Storyline: The Forever Trilogy hasn\u0027t ended yet...now it\u0027s time for Connor \u0026 Ellery\u0027s son to tell his story... \\n I’d like to introduce myself.
