I really pissed my mom off and that’s the last thing I wanted to do.”\n “Lesson learned. I understand the pain you’re going through over Hailey. Trust me, I’ve been there. But, screwing every woman that looks your way isn’t the answer to healing your broken heart.”\n I rolled my eyes and sighed. “I know and I don’t want to talk about Hailey. She’s my past and that’s where she’s staying.”\n “All right, but I want you to remember that everything happens for a reason. It’s hard to see it now, but you will someday.” She winked.\n I got up from my seat and gave her a kiss on the cheek. “It’s a shame you don’t dig guys. You’re missing out on this.” I winked as I grabbed my crotch.\n “Get the hell out of here before I call your daddy.” She smiled.\n “You wouldn’t.” I pointed before opening the door.\n “Probably not.” She smiled.\n I walked out of Mac’s office and down the hall to the elevators. I heard my phone beep and, when I pulled it from my pocket, I saw there was a message from Ellie.\n “Hey, hot stuff. I’m in the lobby at your hotel. Where the hell are you?”\n “On my way, babe. Got held up at the office. Tell the hotel to let you in my room. I’ll be there in fifteen.”\n As soon as I arrived at the hotel, I opened the door and didn’t see Ellie. I walked into the bedroom of the suite and shook my head as I smiled and began to unbutton my shirt.\n “It’s about time, hot stuff. I was getting lonely in this big bed by myself.” She smiled as she lay there totally naked.\n “No worries. I’m here now and I can promise you that you won’t be lonely anymore,” I said with a smile as I grabbed the bottle of Jack, took down my pants, and climbed on the bed.\n The ringing sound of my phone was making my head hurt more than it already was. I rolled out from under Ellie’s arm and grabbed my phone from my pants pocket.\n “Hello,” I whispered.\n “Are you up?” my dad yelled into the phone.\n “I am now.”\n “I need you to head to the office and pick up the plans sometime today. Mackenzie is going to have the changes made and then we’ll be set to move ahead.”\n “Okay,” I said.\n “Late night last night, Collin?”\n “Yes, Dad. Can I call you back later?”\n “Yeah, son. Call me back when you’re not so hung over.”\n “Bye, Dad.”\n I set my phone back on the nightstand. I looked over at Ellie as she lay there sound asleep. We went out last night, drank too much, and had sex all night long. I missed Hailey and there was no denying it. Every time I would go to sleep with a girl, I thought about her. That was why I never slept with a girl unless I was drunk. If I was drunk, I didn’t have to think about her. If I was sober, I felt like I was cheating on her, even though she left me. I couldn’t help but think about Jacob and Diana. His appointment with the specialist was today and I thought maybe it would be cool to hang out after. Ellie started to stir when I got up and pulled on my sweatpants. I walked over to the window in the living area and opened the curtains. I looked out as the sun brightened the sky. After a few moments, I walked back into the bedroom and grabbed my phone. I pulled up Hailey’s name and began sending her a text message.\n “Hey, how have you—” I started to type. Looking at my half-typed message, I threw my phone down on the couch and ran my hands through my hair.\n “What’s wrong, hot stuff?” Ellie said as she wrapped her arms around my waist.\n “I just have a lot on my mind. I have some things I need to do, so I’m going to take a shower and head out. You can order room service if you want.”\n “Nah, I’ll just grab my stuff and go. I had fun last night. How about we do it again tonight?”\n I turned around and looked at her with a small smile. “I wish I could, but I can’t. I have something else to do tonight and my plane will be here early tomorrow. But, thank you for last night.”\n “Any time you’re in town, hot stuff!” She smiled as she kissed me on the cheek and walked back to the bedroom.\n I stepped in the shower and, when I got out, Ellie was already gone. After getting dressed, I went to Diana’s room to see if they left for the specialist yet. There was no answer when I knocked so I walked down to the front desk and left a message for her and Jacob. I had the hotel bring a car around and, when I was on my way to Black Enterprises, Julia called me.\n “Hello,” I answered.\n “How’s your head?”\n “Fine; why do you ask?”\n “I talked to Dad a few minutes ago and he said you had a late night again and you sounded like shit. I think he’s really worried about you.”\n I rolled my eyes and sighed. “There’s no need to worry about me. I’m fine. So what if I like to have fun. Maybe he should try it some time.”\n “I’m thinking that Dad sees himself in you when he was younger. You heard the rumors.”\n “Too bad. I’m not him, and I’ll be fine.”\n “Promise me,” she said.\n “I promise. Now I have to go because I’m at the office.”\n I pressed end and shook my head as I stepped out of the car. As I was walking into the building, Mac was coming out. She looped her arm around mine and turned me around.\n “Did you have breakfast yet?” she asked.\n “No, why?”\n “Good. You’re coming with me, then. I’m starving and we can go over the designs. I spoke with your dad last night.”\n We pulled into the restaurant, ordered breakfast, and, as soon as we started going over the plans, my phone rang. I pulled it from my pocket and it was Diana.\n “Hello,” I answered.\n “Collin, it’s Diana. The desk gave me your message.”\n “Hi, Diana. I was wondering if maybe you and Jacob would like to hang out this afternoon. I thought maybe we could go to the Field Museum. I think Jacob would love it. I know I did when I was his age. Actually, I still do.”\n “That’s very nice of you, Collin, but we don’t want to impose on you. I know you’re a very busy man.”\n “Actually, I’m not that busy and I want to. Jacob will love it. I’ll be back to the hotel in a couple of hours. Okay?”\n “Thank you, Collin. We’ll be here.” \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/collin-forever-4/page-6.html","bookId":1817,"book":{"id":1817,"title":"Collin (Forever #4)","description":"Storyline: \n The Forever Trilogy hasn\u0027t ended yet...now it\u0027s time for Connor \u0026 Ellery\u0027s son to tell his story... \n I’d like to introduce myself.
