We stepped up onto the boat and she immediately went and sat down, gripping the side of the boat as tightly as she could. I stood there and watched as her legs began to shake.\n What the fuck did I do? What was I thinking?\n “I’m so sorry, baby,” I said as I kneeled down in front of her and placed my hands on her knees. “I didn’t mean for this to be so hard on you. Let’s go. I’m taking you back to the house,” I said as I held out my hand.\n She shook her head. “I made the decision to come out here and I will stay. I spent the last two hours thinking, and I’m not turning back now. I can’t. I have to do this. You’re right. I can’t live my life in fear anymore. You’ve taught me to enjoy life again. You’ve given me hope and security and love. The least I can do is try.”\n “Oh, babe,” I said as I wrapped my arms around her and held her tight. “You’re an amazing woman, but I don’t want you to make yourself sick over this.”\n “Do you know how to sail?” she asked with a whisper.\n “Me? Of course I know how to sail. I’m the master at sailing.”\n “Then undock this boat and let’s go. You need to do it now before I change my mind.”\n “Okay!” I said as I kissed her on the lips and got ready to set sail.\n I was having a hard time getting the boat to the appropriate speed.\n “Collin, what’s wrong?”\n “Nothing’s wrong, baby. Just relax.”\n “The wind is coming from the other side. You have to change the direction of the boat,” she said.\n “I’m trying, babe. Just hold on.”\n “Oh my God,” she huffed as she got up from her seat. “I thought you said you knew how to sail?”\n “I do.”\n “Move,” she said as I stepped out of the way and she took over.\n Mission accomplished. I smiled to myself.\n I stood behind her and wrapped my arms around her as she sailed the boat out into the open ocean. The light wind swept across our faces and the ocean air was as refreshing as ever.\n “It’s beautiful out here,” she said.\n “It sure is, baby. Are you okay?”\n “Not really. But, I can do this.”\n “Just remember how it used to feel before the accident.”\n “I’m trying to. But it’s hard, you know?”\n “I know. But you’re doing great. Tiny steps, baby. Tiny steps.”\n She turned her head around and looked at me with a small smile. I leaned down and kissed her soft lips, and we continued to sail for the next couple of hours. I never once let go of her. Whether I was holding onto her waist or just holding her hand, I wanted her to feel safe.\n We docked the boat and, as soon as we stepped off, Amelia grabbed me and wrapped her arms around me as tightly as she could.\n “What’s wrong, baby?”\n “Thank you. That’s all,” she said.\n I closed my eyes as I kissed the top of her head. “I didn’t do anything. You were the one who made the choice.”\n “A choice I never would have made if you didn’t give me that little push.”\n I broke our embrace and kissed her lips. “I love you, and I just want you to be at peace with your life.”\n “I am because of you.” She smiled.\n Chapter 32\n “Is everyone ready?” my dad asked.\n “We are.” Julia smiled as she held Brayden.\n Today was the day that we were going to spread Denny’s ashes across the Pacific. I held on tightly to Amelia’s hand as we stepped onto the yacht.\n “Are you okay?” I asked her.\n “She’s fine.” My dad smiled as he put his arm around her.\n “I’m fine.” She smiled at both me and my dad.\n It was the perfect day. The sky was bright blue and the sun was shining brightly. Up on deck was a spread of cheese, crackers, an assortment of fruit, and bottles of wine and champagne.\n “Okay; everyone listen up,” my dad announced. “I want to thank everyone for being here today. This is exactly what Denny wanted and, even though I wasn’t very pleased at first, I’m happy to do this. It has brought us all together and Denny was a huge part of this family. So I want everyone to eat, drink, and enjoy the ride. As soon as we get out far enough, we’ll spread his ashes over the water, as he wished.”\n My mom walked over and sat down next me as I watched Amelia stand next to Jacob. The two of them leaned against the rails and looked at the ocean water.\n “How did you do it?”\n “Do what?” I asked.\n “Get Amelia to overcome her fear of boats?”\n “I took her to the marina and prayed that she’d sail with me. It took a couple of hours for her to come around, but she finally did, and I helped her through it.”\n “She’s a wonderful girl, and I’m so happy you found her.” She smiled.\n “She found me, remember?”\n “Just like I found your father. I guess your bad behaviors had their rewards. You sure are your father’s son and I couldn’t be more proud of you. He told me about the cystic fibrosis charity you want the company to start running. I think it’s a wonderful idea and what you’ve already done for Diana and Jacob is really heartwarming. You’re an amazing man, Collin, and you’re my sweet boy.” She smiled as she brought her hand up to my cheek with tears in her eyes.\n “Mom, stop.”\n “I can’t help it. You and Julia have made me and your father so proud.”\n I put my arm around her and kissed her cheek. “That’s because we have the best mom and dad in the world.”\n My dad announced that it was time to scatter the ashes and for everyone to gather around. He first made sure we all had drinks in our hands. Amelia walked over to me and put her arm around my waist. We all stood and watched as my dad took the lid off the urn and let Denny’s ashes go.\n “Goodbye, my friend. May you be at peace and have an eternity filled with happiness.”\n “To Denny,” I said as I held up my glass.\n “To Denny,” everyone followed.\n Once the ashes were scattered and my dad dried his tears, he walked up to me and Julia and wrapped his arms around both of us. “I love you two very much.”\n “We love you too, Dad,” Julia and I both said at the same time.\n He patted us on our backs and smiled. “Now, I’m going to go rescue my grandson from Mason.” \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/collin-forever-4/page-53.html","bookId":1817,"book":{"id":1817,"title":"Collin (Forever #4)","description":"Storyline: \n The Forever Trilogy hasn\u0027t ended yet...now it\u0027s time for Connor \u0026 Ellery\u0027s son to tell his story... \n I’d like to introduce myself.
