The fact that I still hadn’t told her about the beach house was haunting me. I couldn’t wait until the summer to tell her. I had to tell her as soon as we got back to New York. She opened her eyes and then closed them again as the corners of her mouth curved up. Her hand, which lay on my chest, moved down my torso and down the front of my underwear. She lightly took hold of my erection and opened one eye while she smiled at me.\n “You’re so hard.” She smiled.\n “I always am when I’m with you.”\n “Well, let’s put that hard-on to good use, shall we?” she asked as she climbed out from under my arms and got on top of me.\n “You’re my kind of girl.” I smiled as I took her breast in my mouth.\n “And you’re my kind of guy,” she said as she slowly placed my cock inside her.\n I thrust my hips as my teeth tugged on her erect nipple. She sat up, taking my entire length inside her as she let out a soft moan. Her hips moved back and forth as she rode me slowly. I threw my head back at the intense pleasure she was giving me. She was dripping wet and I could feel it running down my balls.\n “Baby, you feel so good.”\n “So do you,” she whispered as she continued to move.\n I reached up and grasped her breasts with my hands and kneaded them, paying special attention to her hard nipples, which my fingers liked to play with. Her hips started to move faster and I could feel her swelling around me.\n “Do it, baby. Come all over me.”\n “Collin. Collin. Oh my God,” she whispered as her body tightened and she released herself, forcing me to spill inside her.\n “Ah,” I moaned and I thrust my hips up and stayed buried deep inside her.\n She collapsed on top of me and buried her face into my neck. “Good morning.”\n “And what a good morning it is.” I smiled as I kissed her head.\n Suddenly, there was a knock at the door. “Breakfast is ready, you two,” my dad said.\n “Okay, Dad. We’ll be down in a minute.”\n Amelia rolled off of me and started laughing. “What if he would have walked in and saw me lying on top of you?”\n “Then we would’ve given him a show.” I winked.\n “Collin, that’s not funny.”\n “Yeah, it is. Did I ever tell you about the time he walked in on Julia having sex for the first time?”\n “Oh my God! Are you serious?”\n “Dead serious. Ask her about it some time. I thought he was going to murder her. Come on; we better get dressed and get downstairs before someone comes up here and breaks down the door.”\n Louise made us an amazing breakfast, as always. I took my plate and joined my mom, dad, and Amelia outside on the patio. I looked down towards the beach and saw Jacob in the water with Mason.\n “Son, I want you to join me today when I talk to Diana. We’re also going to take her to the art gallery. There’s a house down the beach for sale. It’s smaller. They don’t need this big of a house for the two of them. I have the house on hold, and if Diana decides she wants to move here, then I’ll rent it out to her.”\n “Okay, Dad. Just let me know when you’re ready.”\n “I spoke with her last night down on the beach and she told me how beautiful it was here and that she really liked it. So, we’ll see. I called Joel at the art gallery and told him our plan. He said he’s excited to meet Diana and he’ll help in any way he can. Your mother and I had dinner last night with Ian and Rory and they said that they’d also keep an eye on her and Jacob if she decided to move here.”\n “Great. It sounds like you have everything covered.”\n My mom and dad both got up from their seats. “As soon as you’re finished eating, we’ll talk with her. Amelia can spend the day with your mom and Julia. They’re going shopping.”\n “Oh, I love to shop.” She smiled.\n “They have the cutest little shops here. I can’t wait to show you them and you don’t have to worry about bringing any money because our shopping trip is on Connor today. Isn’t it, sweetheart?” She smiled as she ran her hand down his cheek.\n “Yes, I guess it is. Feel free to buy whatever you like,” my dad said.\n They walked into the house and I leaned over and smiled at Amelia. “Make sure you buy a lot and if you see anything you think I’d like, buy it.”\n “Collin, stop that.” She giggled.\n “No, I’m serious, and trust me, my mom will make you buy something.”\n We finished our breakfast and took our plates inside. I gave Louise a kiss on the cheek and thanked her for the great meal. Amelia went upstairs to change into a sundress to go shopping in, and I decided to go down to the beach to see Jacob and Mason. When I walked down, I saw a young girl talking to Jacob. I walked over to Mason, who was standing a few feet away from them.\n “Hey, Mason. Who’s that?”\n “I’m not sure. We were getting out of the water and she just came walking up.”\n “That’s cute. She’s a cute kid.”\n A few moments later, the girl left and Jacob walked over to where Mason and I were standing.\n “Hey, bro. Who was that?” I asked.\n “Her name is Lexi and she lives in a house way down the beach.”\n “Was she hitting on you?” I smiled.\n “Knock it off, Collin.” He smiled back. “She has cystic fibrosis too,” he said as we started walking towards the house.\n “Really? How did that come up?”\n “She started coughing a little and it sounded like mine, so I told her that I cough like that sometimes, and she told me.”\n I could tell that Jacob was happy because he finally met someone that was like him. As we walked in the house, the women were getting ready to leave to go shopping and my dad had arranged for Jake and Mason to spend the day with Jacob. I gave Amelia a hug and kiss goodbye.\n “Remember, my dad’s buying. Shop. Shop. Shop.”\n She giggled and playfully smacked me on the chest. “I’ll do my best. I love you.”\n “I love you too, baby.”\n “What did you want to talk about, Connor?” Diana asked as we went and sat outside.\n “Collin, why don’t you start?” my dad said.\n “You two have me very nervous,” Diana spoke.\n I reached over and grabbed her hand. “Don’t be nervous, Diana. I just don’t know how to say this.” \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/collin-forever-4/page-54.html","bookId":1817,"book":{"id":1817,"title":"Collin (Forever #4)","description":"Storyline: \n The Forever Trilogy hasn\u0027t ended yet...now it\u0027s time for Connor \u0026 Ellery\u0027s son to tell his story... \n I’d like to introduce myself.
