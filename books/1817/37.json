I surely don’t,” I said.\n “Why didn’t you tell me?” Amelia asked.\n “What did you want me to say? Hey, by the way, my ex is back in town.”\n “Yeah, something like that. Maybe I wouldn’t have been caught off guard.”\n “I don’t want to talk about this anymore. Let’s just eat,” I sighed.\n Now I was angry. I was angry at Hailey for showing up at my family’s party. Who the hell did she think she was after all this time? Not only did she piss me off, but she upset Amelia, and I was afraid that her being here was going to cause an argument. As I looked across the patio, I saw her talking to Julia. Peyton walked over to me and gave me a hug from behind.\n “I’m so sorry, Collin. I told her not to come, but she wouldn’t listen,” she whispered in my ear.\n “It’s okay, Peyton. Don’t worry about it.”\n She gave me a squeeze and walked over to where my mom and dad were. I looked at Hailey and noticed she had a different look about her. Not physically, but emotionally. She looked unsure and sad. After everyone ate, we sang “Happy Birthday” to Jake and had cake. I tried to get Amelia to have some, but she wouldn’t. The happiness she displayed earlier was gone and now she was in a somber state.\n “Hey, do you think we can have that talk now?” Hailey asked as she walked up to me.\n I looked over at Amelia. “Go ahead. Go talk and get it over with so we can go on with our evening,” she said.\n “Amelia, do you want to go inside and play some X-box?” Jacob asked.\n “Sure, Jacob. I’d love to.”\n Before Amelia walked away, she gave me a kiss and told me that she’d be waiting for me. I didn’t want to talk to Hailey, but I didn’t have a choice.\n “Let’s make this quick, Hailey. What do you want to talk about?”\n “Can we at least go somewhere quiet? Like down to the beach?”\n I rolled my eyes and sighed. “Fine.”\n We walked down to the beach and Hailey sat down in the sand. I sat down next to her and asked her what she needed to talk about.\n “I’m pregnant,” she said as she looked down.\n My heart stopped for a split second and I didn’t know what to say. “Wow. Do your parents know?”\n “No, not yet. I don’t know how to tell them.”\n “What about the father? Does he know?”\n “Yeah, he knows and he wasn’t happy. When I refused to get an abortion, he broke up with me.”\n “Nice guy,” I said.\n She reached over and placed her hand on mine. I immediately pulled my hand away from her. “Listen, Hailey. I’m sorry for what you’re going through, but I have a girlfriend who I care for very deeply and she’s the priority in my life.”\n “I’m sorry, Collin. I’m so sorry for hurting you.” She began to cry.\n I stood up and, when I started to walk away, I stopped and turned to her. “Sorry isn’t going to cut it this time, Hailey. You made your choice the minute you got on that plane.”\n I turned around and walked back to the house. I grabbed a beer from the fridge and told Amelia to meet me up in my room when she and Jacob finished their game. I went upstairs and sat on my bed with my back up against the headboard. As I took a drink of my beer, Amelia walked in and climbed on the bed next to me.\n “How’d it go?” she asked nervously.\n “She’s pregnant.”\n “The baby’s not—”\n “God, no!” I interrupted. “Supposedly, the guy she was with wasn’t happy about the baby and he wanted her to get an abortion. When she refused, he kicked her out.”\n “That’s terrible. How could someone be so cruel?”\n “I don’t know, but it’s not my problem,” I said as I threw back my beer.\n She put her arm across my chest and snuggled close to me. I put my arm around her and gripped her shoulder firmly. Everything felt right with her. I was happy and no one was going to ruin that for me.\n I woke up holding Amelia in my arms. We both fell asleep last night after we talked about Hailey. I carefully moved my arm and quietly rolled out of bed so I didn’t wake her. I stood there and stared at her as I pulled the sheet over her. I was falling in love with this girl and I wanted to tell her so badly, but I was scared. I walked downstairs and made a pot of coffee. As soon as the coffee was done brewing, Julia walked in.\n “Morning, Collin.”\n “Morning, Julia. You look bigger than you did yesterday.” I smiled as I poured her a cup of coffee.\n “Thanks, and I feel it too. Did Hailey tell you?”\n “Yeah, she told me.”\n “Do you want to talk about it?” she asked.\n “There’s nothing to talk about. It has nothing to do with me.”\n “It doesn’t bother you at all that she’s pregnant?”\n “Why the hell would it? She dumped me and told me to move on. So I did. I don’t have feelings for her at all. I’m happy with Amelia. She’s the girl I want. Hailey will have to deal with this baby on her own. It’s not my fault she got knocked up.”\n “Whoa. Tell me how you really feel.” She laughed.\n “I just did and I don’t want to talk about it anymore. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to bring my girlfriend some coffee.”\n I made Amelia’s coffee exactly how she liked it: one part cream and one part sugar. I walked back up to the bedroom and, when I opened the door, she was lying there, staring at me. I smiled as I set the cups down on the nightstand.\n “Morning, beautiful.” I smiled as I leaned over and kissed her.\n “Morning, handsome. I can’t believe we both fell asleep last night.”\n “I brought you some coffee.”\n She sat up and I handed her the cup. “Thank you.” She smiled.\n I climbed back on the bed and she leaned her head on my shoulder. “I don’t want to go back to the city. I love it here.”\n “I know. I do too. But, you have school tomorrow and clinicals, and I have work. We don’t have to go back until later, so we’ll do whatever you want to do today. It’s your choice,” I said as I kissed her head.\n “I want to go horseback riding.”\n “Seriously?” I asked.\n “Yes. That day we went was amazing and I would love to do it again.” \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/collin-forever-4/page-37.html","bookId":1817,"book":{"id":1817,"title":"Collin (Forever #4)","description":"Storyline: \n The Forever Trilogy hasn\u0027t ended yet...now it\u0027s time for Connor \u0026 Ellery\u0027s son to tell his story... \n I’d like to introduce myself.
