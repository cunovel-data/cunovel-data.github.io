{"id":101517,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"Pam shoved Victor off and leaped to her feet. I\u0027d been so scared I\u0027d kill Pam that I hadn\u0027t been forceful enough. I hadn\u0027t cut all the way through Victor, though I\u0027d severed his spinal column. The sword stuck on the bone and I couldn\u0027t remove it. Horrified at myself, at the sensation of cutting into Victor, I backpedaled and covered my mouth.\n Pam yanked the sword out of the wound and decapitated Victor.\n \"Surrender,\" Eric said to the gravely wounded Akiro.\n Akiro shook his head. The wound in his throat prevented him from speaking.\n \"All right, then,\" Eric said wearily. He grabbed Akiro\u0027s head and broke his neck. The audible snap was deeply disgusting. I turned away, my stomach heaving while I told it to sit down and shut up. While Akiro lay helpless, Eric staked him.\n And it was over. Victor and all his vampire attendants--and his human attendants, too--were dead. There were enough flaking vampires to change the quality of the air.\n I sank down on a chair. Actually, I lost control of my legs and a chair happened to be underneath me.\n Thalia was weeping over the pain of her amputated arm, but she was struggling hard against this display of weakness. Indira squatted on the floor looking exhausted but gleeful. Maxwell Lee, Parker, and Rubio had lesser injuries. Pam and Eric were covered in blood, both their own and Victor\u0027s. Palomino walked slowly over to Rubio and put her arms around him, drawing Parker into the embrace. Colton was kneeling by the dead Audrina, weeping.\n I never wanted to see another battle, large or small, in my life. I looked at my lover, my husband, and he looked like a stranger to me. He and Pam stood facing each other, holding hands and beaming through the blood. Then they simply collapsed into each other, and Pam began laughing in a breathless way. \"It\u0027s done!\" she said. \"It\u0027s done. We\u0027re free.\"\n Until Felipe de Castro comes down on us like a ton of bricks because he wants to know what happened to his regent, I thought, but I didn\u0027t say anything. A, I wasn\u0027t sure I could. B, we\u0027d already wondered what would happen, but Eric\u0027s opinion was that it was better to ask forgiveness than permission.\n Mustapha was on his cell phone, which was about as big as a cricket. \"Warren, no point in you coming in, man,\" he said. \"The deed is done. Good shot. Yeah, we got him.\"\n Parker said, \"Sheriff, we\u0027re leaving for home unless you need us.\" The weedy young man was supporting Palomino, and Rubio was on her other side. They were all pretty battered in one way or another.\n \"You may go.\" Eric, smeared with blood, was still very much the ruler. \"You answered my call and did your jobs. You\u0027ll be rewarded.\"\n Palomino, Rubio, and Parker mutually assisted each other to the back door. From their expressions, I was sure they hoped Eric didn\u0027t call them in again for a long, long time, no matter what the reward might be.\n Indira crawled over to Thalia to apply Thalia\u0027s severed arm to its shoulder with force. She held it there, beaming. Indira was the happiest person in the club.\n \"Will that work?\" I asked Pam, nodding at the shoulder-arm conjunction. Pam was wiping the bloody sword on Akiro\u0027s clothing. His throat was almost gone; wounded parts disintegrate more quickly than uninjured parts.\n \"Sometimes,\" she said, shrugging. \"Since Thalia is so old, there\u0027s a chance. It\u0027s less painful and time-consuming than regeneration.\"\n \"Thalia, can I get you some blood?\" I didn\u0027t think I\u0027d ever been brave enough to address Thalia directly, but I could sure bring her some bottled blood and be glad to do it. She looked up at me, her eyes full of involuntary tears. It was obvious she was forcing herself to hold still. \"Not unless you want to donate yourself,\" she said in her heavily accented English. \"But Eric wouldn\u0027t be pleased if I drank from you. Immanuel, give me a mouthful?\"\n \"All right,\" he said. The skinny hairdresser looked more than a little dazed.\n \"You sure?\" I asked. \"You don\u0027t quite seem yourself.\"\n \"Hell, yes,\" Immanuel said unconvincingly. \"The guy who killed my sister is dead. I\u0027m feeling good.\"\n He didn\u0027t look it, but I was sure I didn\u0027t, either. I\u0027d said as much as I could, so I sat by while Immanuel crouched awkwardly before Thalia\u0027s chair. The height differential was not in their favor. Thalia wrapped her good arm around Immanuel\u0027s neck and sank her fangs in without any further discussion. The expression on Immanuel\u0027s face went from bleak to blissful.\n Thalia was a noisy eater.\n Indira squatted beside her in her blood-drenched sari, patiently holding the severed limb to its source. As Thalia drank, I noticed that the arm looked more and more natural. The fingers flexed. I was astonished, but it was only one more extreme event during an evening of them.\n Pam looked a little put out once her victory celebration with Eric was over and she saw that Immanuel was offering his blood to someone else. She asked Mustapha if he\u0027d give her a drink, and he shrugged. \"Comes with the job,\" he said, pulling down the neck of his black T-shirt. Pam looked incredibly white against Mustapha, and Mustapha\u0027s teeth bared in a grimace when she bit in. He, too, looked happier after a second.\n Eric came over to me, beaming. I had never been more undilutedly glad that our bond was broken, because I didn\u0027t want to feel what he was feeling, even a little bit. He put his arms around me, kissed me with enthusiasm, and all I could smell was blood. He was wet with it. It was getting all over my dress and my arms and my chest.\n After a minute he drew back, frowning. \"Sookie?\" he said. \"You\u0027re not rejoicing?\"\n I tried to think of what to say. I felt like a big fat hypocrite. \"Eric, I\u0027m glad we don\u0027t have to worry about Victor anymore. And I know this was what we planned. But surrounded by dead people and body parts is not my idea of a good place for a celebration, and I\u0027ve never been less horny in my life.\"\n His eyes narrowed. He didn\u0027t like my raining on his parade. Understandable.\n And that was the thing, wasn\u0027t it? I found all of this understandable . But I still hated it, hated myself, wasn\u0027t too fond of anyone else. \"You need some blood,\" I said. \"I really am sorry you were wounded, and you go ahead and take some.\"\n \"You are being a hypocrite, and I will take blood,\" he said, and he struck.\n It hurt. He didn\u0027t make it feel good, an action almost automatic for a vampire. Tears ran down my face without my wanting them to. In an odd way, I felt the pain was merited, justified--but I also understood this was a turning point in our relationship.\n Our relationship had been marked by a thousand turning points, seemed like.\n Then Bill stood at my shoulder, staring at Eric\u0027s mouth on my throat. His expression was complex: rage, resentment, longing.\n I was ready for something simple, and I was ready for the pain to stop. My eyes met Bill\u0027s.\n \"Sheriff,\" Bill said. His voice had never been smoother. Eric twitched, and I knew he\u0027d heard Bill, knew Eric realized he should stop. But he didn\u0027t. I shook myself free of the lethargy and self-loathing, grabbed hold of Eric\u0027s earlobe, and pinched as hard as I could.\n He detached with a gasp. His mouth was bloody.\n \"Bill\u0027s gonna take me home,\" I said. \"We\u0027ll talk tomorrow night. Maybe.\"\n Eric bent down to kiss me, but I flinched. Not with that bloody mouth.\n \"Tomorrow,\" Eric said, his eyes searching my face. He turned away and called, \"Listen up, people! We have to start cleaning the club.\"\n They groaned like kids told to pick up their toys. Immanuel went to Colton and helped him up. \"You can stay at my place,\" Immanuel said. \"It\u0027s not too far.\"\n \"I won\u0027t sleep,\" Colton answered. \"Audrina\u0027s dead.\"\n \"We\u0027ll get through the night,\" Immanuel told him.\n The two human men left Fangtasia, their shoulders slumped with exhaustion and grief. I wondered how they felt about their vengeance now that it had been accomplished, but I knew I\u0027d never ask them. I might never see them again.\n Bill put his arm around me as I stumbled a little, and I found myself glad he was there to help me. I knew I couldn\u0027t have driven myself. I found my purse, still with a couple of stakes inside, and I pulled my keys out of an inside pocket.\n \"Where did Bubba go?\" I asked.\n \"He likes to go hang around the old Civic Auditorium,\" Bill said. \"He used to perform there. He\u0027ll dig a hole, sleep in the ground.\"\n I nodded. I was too tired to say anything.\n Bill didn\u0027t speak again the whole way home, which was a blessing. I stared through the windshield into the black night, wondering how I\u0027d feel tomorrow. That had been a lot of killing, and it had been so fast and bloody--like watching one of those violence-porn movies. I\u0027d seen a few seconds of one of the Saw movies when I was at Jason\u0027s house. That had been enough for me.\n I fully believed that Victor had set this in motion with his own intransigence. If Felipe had put someone else in charge of Louisiana, the whole catastrophe wouldn\u0027t have occurred. Maybe I could blame Felipe? No, the buck had to stop here.\n \"What are you thinking of?\" Bill said as we were going down my driveway.\n \"I\u0027m thinking about blame and guilt and assassination,\" I said.\n He simply nodded. \"Me, too. Sookie, you know that Victor did his best to provoke Eric.\"\n We\u0027d parked behind the house, and I turned to him questioningly, my hand on the car door handle.\n \"Yes,\" Bill said. \"He was doing his best to provoke Eric to act, so that he could kill Eric without having to justify it. It\u0027s only because of superior planning that Eric has survived and Victor has not. I know that you love Eric.\" His voice remained calm and cool as he said this, and only the lines around his eyes told me how much it cost him. \"You have to be glad, and maybe tomorrow you will be glad, that this situation has ended the way it has.\"\n I pinched my mouth together for a second while I formed my response. \"I\u0027d rather Eric be alive than Victor,\" I said. \"True enough.\"\n \"And you know violence was the only way to achieve that result.\"\n I could even see that. I nodded.\n \"So why the second-guessing?\" Bill said. He was calling me on my reaction.\n I let go of the door handle and turned to face him. \"It was bloody and ghastly, and people suffered,\" I said, surprised by the anger in my voice.\n \"Did you think Victor would die without bleeding? Did you think Victor\u0027s people wouldn\u0027t do their best to prevent his death? Did you think that no one would die?\"\n His voice was so calm and nonjudgmental that I didn\u0027t get angry. \"Bill, I never believed any of those things. I\u0027m not na?ve. But seeing is always different from planning.\"\n Abruptly, I was tired of this topic. It had happened, it was done, I had to find a way to get over it. \"Have you met the Queen of Oklahoma?\" I asked him.\n \"Yes,\" he said, a definite note of caution in his voice. \"Why do you ask?\"\n \"Before he died, Appius sort of gave Eric to her.\"\n This did shock Bill. \"You\u0027re sure?\"\n \"Yes. He finally told me after Pam did everything but stick her hand up his ass and wiggle her fingers to make him talk.\"\n Bill turned away, but not before I saw the smile he was trying to suppress. \"Pam\u0027s very determined when she wants Eric to take a particular course of action. Did Eric tell you what he intends to do about this situation?\"\n \"He\u0027s trying to get out of it, but evidently Appius signed something. When Appius told me before he died that I\u0027d never keep Eric, I didn\u0027t know that was what he meant. I thought he meant Eric wouldn\u0027t want to fool with me when I got old and wrinkled, or that we\u0027d quarrel and break up, or that . . . Oh, I don\u0027t know. Something would happen to separate us.\"\n \"And now something has.\"\n \"Well . . . yes.\"\n \"You know that he\u0027ll have to put you aside if he marries the queen? Eric can certainly feed off humans if he\u0027s married to a royal, and he can even have a pet human, but he can\u0027t have a wife.\"\n \"That\u0027s what he gave me to understand.\"\n \"Sookie . . . don\u0027t do anything rash.\"\n \"I already broke the bond.\"\n After a long pause, Bill said, \"That\u0027s a good thing, because the bond was risky for both of you.\" Not exactly news.\n \"I sort of miss having the connection,\" I confessed, \"but at the same time it\u0027s a relief.\"\n Bill didn\u0027t say anything. Very carefully.\n \"Have you ever . . . ?\" I asked.\n \"Once, long ago,\" he said. He didn\u0027t want to talk about it.\n \"Did it end well?\"\n \"No,\" he said. His voice was flat and didn\u0027t invite me to continue that line of conversation. \"Let it go, Sookie. I\u0027m telling you this not as a former lover, but as a friend. Let Eric make up his own mind about this. Don\u0027t ask him questions. Though we can\u0027t stand each other, I know Eric will try his best to get out of this situation simply because he loves his freedom. Oklahoma is very beautiful, and Eric loves beauty, but he already has that in you.\"\n I must be feeling better if I could appreciate a compliment. I wondered what the queen\u0027s real name was. Often the ruler was called by the name of the land she ruled; Bill hadn\u0027t meant that the state was beautiful, but that the woman who ruled its night creatures was.\n When I didn\u0027t respond, Bill continued, \"She also has a lot of power. That is, she has territory, minions, real estate, oil money.\" And we both knew Eric loved power. Not complete power--he\u0027d never wanted to be a king--but he loved being able to call the shots in his own bailiwick.\n \"I get what power is,\" I said. \"And I get that I don\u0027t have it. You want to take the car to your house, or leave it here and go through the woods?\"\n He handed the keys to me and said, \"I\u0027ll go through the woods.\"\n There was nothing more to be said.\n \"Thanks,\" I told him. I opened the porch door, stepped in, locked it behind me. I unlocked the back door and went in, switching on the kitchen light. There was a quiet emptiness to the house, which I found immediately soothing, and the air conditioners were doing their best to make everything cool.\n Though I\u0027d come out of the fight at Fangtasia better than anyone, at least physically, I felt battered and bruised. I\u0027d be sore the next day. I unbuckled the big belt and returned the cluviel dor to my makeup drawer. I pulled off the stained dress, went to the back porch to toss it in the washing machine on cold soak, and got in the shower, turning the water as hot as I could bear it. When I\u0027d scrubbed myself all over, I changed the temperature to cool. I was delightfully clean and fresh when I got out to dry myself.\n I wondered if I would start crying or praying or sitting in a corner with my eyes wide open the rest of the night. But none of those reactions set in. I got into bed feeling relieved, as if I\u0027d had a successful surgery or as if a biopsy had turned out well.\n I thought, as I curled into a ball and composed myself for sleep, that the fact that I could sleep tonight was almost more frightening than anything else. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dead-reckoning-sookie-stackhouse-11/page-16.html","bookId":2201,"book":{"id":2201,"title":"Dead Reckoning (Sookie Stackhouse #11)","description":"Storyline: \n Dead Reckoning (Sookie Stackhouse #11) \n With her knack for being in trouble\u0027s way, Sookie witnesses the firebombing of Merlotte\u0027s, the bar where she works.
