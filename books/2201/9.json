{"id":101511,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"I should have foreseen this, I told myself for the tenth, or twentieth, time. I\u0027d rushed into something that I should have prepared for. At the least, I should have called Eric and warned him what was about to happen. But I\u0027d been afraid he\u0027d talk me out of it, and I had to know what my true feeling for him was. Just at the moment, Eric\u0027s true feeling for me was anger. He was mighty pissed off. On the one hand, I didn\u0027t blame him. We were supposed to be in love, and that meant we were supposed to consult one another, right? On the other hand, I could count the times Eric had consulted me without even using up all my fingers. On one of my hands. So at other moments, I did blame him for his reaction. Of course he wouldn\u0027t have let me do it, and I would never have known something I had to know. So I was hopping from foot to foot mentally when it came to deciding whether I\u0027d done the right thing. But I was upset and worried pretty much nonstop, no matter which foot I was standing on at the moment. Bob and Amelia had a consultation in their bedroom, as a result of which they decided to stay another day to \"see what happens.\" I could tell Amelia was worried. She thought she ought to have eased into the idea a little more slowly before encouraging me to take the plunge. Bob thought we were both being silly, but he was smart enough not to say so. However, he couldn\u0027t help but think it, and though he wasn\u0027t as clear a broadcaster as Amelia, I could hear him. I did go to work the next day, but I was so distracted and miserable, and business was so light, that Sam told me to go home early. India kindly patted me on the shoulder and told me to take it easy, a concept I had a lot of trouble understanding. That night, Eric came an hour after sundown. He drove up, so we\u0027d have warning. I\u0027d hoped he would come, and I\u0027d been pretty sure he would have cooled off enough. Right after supper, I\u0027d asked Amelia and Bob if they\u0027d like to go to a movie in Clarice. \"You sure you\u0027ll be all right?\" Amelia had asked. \"Because we\u0027re ready to stay with you if you think he\u0027s still angry.\" If she\u0027d been pleased before, it had vanished now. \"I don\u0027t know how he feels,\" I said, and I was still a little giddy at the thought. \"But I do think he\u0027ll come tonight. It\u0027d probably go better if he didn\u0027t have you here to make him madder.\" Bob had bristled a little at that, but Amelia had nodded understandingly. \"I hope you still think of me as your friend,\" she said, and for once I didn\u0027t see her thoughts coming. \"I mean, I think I\u0027ve screwed you up, but that wasn\u0027t my intention. I intended to free you.\" \"I understand, and I still think of you as one of my best friends,\" I said as reassuringly as I could manage. If I was weak-willed enough to go along with Amelia\u0027s impulses, then it was my problem. I was sitting alone on my front porch in that gloomy kind of mood where you remember all of your mistakes and none of your good decisions when I saw the headlights of Eric\u0027s car zooming up the driveway. I didn\u0027t expect that he would hesitate when he got out of the car. \"Are you still mad?\" I said, trying not to cry. Weeping would be craven, and I was forcing some steel into my backbone. \"Do you still love me?\" he asked. \"You first.\" Childish. \"I\u0027m not angry,\" he said. \"At least, not anymore. At least, not right now. I should have encouraged you to find a way to break the bond, and in fact we have a ritual for it. I should have offered it to you. I was afraid that without it we would be parted, whether because you didn\u0027t want to be dragged into my troubles or because Victor found out you were vulnerable. If he chooses to ignore the marriage, without the bond I won\u0027t know that you are in danger.\" \"I should have asked you what you thought, or at least warned you what we were going to do,\" I said. I took a deep breath. \"I do love you, all on my own.\" And he was up on the porch with me, and then he was picking me up and kissing me, my lips, my neck, my shoulders. He held my feet off the ground and lifted me high enough that his mouth could find my breasts through my bra and T-shirt. I gave a little shriek and swung my legs until they latched around him. I rubbed against him as hard as I could. Eric loved monkey sex. He said, \"I\u0027m going to tear your clothes.\" \"Okay.\" And he was as good as his word. After an exciting few minutes, he said, \"I\u0027m tearing mine, too.\" \"Sure,\" I mumbled, before I bit his earlobe. He growled. There was nothing civilized about sex with Eric. I heard more ripping, and then there was nothing at all between me and him. He was inside me, deep inside me, and he staggered backward to land on the porch swing, which began rocking back and forth erratically. After a moment of surprise we began working with its motion. It went on and on until I could feel the increased tension, the almost-there feeling of impending release. \"Go hard,\" I said urgently. \"Go go go . . .\" \"Is . . . this . . . hard . . . enough?\" And I shrieked out loud, my head falling back. \"Come on, Eric,\" I said, when my aftershocks were still rippling through me. \"Come on!\" And I moved faster than I\u0027d imagined I was able. \"Sookie!\" he gasped, and gave me one last huge thrust followed by a sound that I might have thought was primal pain if I hadn\u0027t known much better. It was magnificent, it was exhausting, and it was completely excellent. We stayed on the swing for at least thirty minutes, recovering, cooling off, and holding each other. I was so happy and relaxed I didn\u0027t want to move, but of course I needed to go inside to clean myself up and to put on some clothes that didn\u0027t have the seams ripped out. Eric had only popped the button off his jeans, and he could hold them closed with his belt, which he\u0027d managed to unbuckle before we\u0027d gotten to the tearing stage. His zipper was still workable. While I arranged myself, he heated up some blood and fixed an ice pack and a glass of iced tea for me. He applied the ice pack himself while I lay on the couch. I thought, I was right to break the bond. And it was a relief not to know how Eric was feeling, though simultaneously I was afraid there was something wrong about my relief. For a few minutes, we talked about little things. He brushed my hair, which was in a terrible tangle, and I brushed his. (Monkeys searched each other for salt crystals, I believed. We groomed each other.) When I\u0027d made his hair all smooth and shiny he draped my legs over his lap. His hand ran up and down them, from the hem of my shorts to my toes, over and over. \"Has Victor said anything to you?\" I wasn\u0027t looking forward to reopening the conversation about what I\u0027d done, though we\u0027d opened our meeting with a bang. \"Not about the bond, so he doesn\u0027t know yet. He would have been on the phone instantly.\" Eric leaned his head against the back of the couch, his blue eyes at half mast. Postcoital relaxation. That was a relief. \"How\u0027s Miriam? Did she recover?\" \"She recovered from the drugs Victor gave her, but she\u0027s sicker in body. Pam is as close to despair as I\u0027ve ever seen her.\" \"Did their relationship come on kind of slowly? Because I didn\u0027t have a clue until Immanuel told me about it.\" \"Pam doesn\u0027t often care for anyone as much she cares about Miriam,\" he said. His head turned slowly, and his eyes met mine. \"I only found out when she asked for some time off from the club to visit Miriam in the hospital. And she gave the girl blood, too, which is the only reason Miriam\u0027s lasted this long.\" \"Vampire blood can\u0027t cure her?\" \"Our blood is good for healing open wounds,\" Eric said. \"For illnesses, it can offer relief, but seldom a cure.\" \"I wonder why?\" Eric shrugged. \"I\u0027m sure one of your scientists would have a theory, but I don\u0027t. And since some people go crazy when they take our blood, the risk is considerable. I was happier when the properties of our blood were secret, but I suppose that couldn\u0027t be kept quiet for long. Victor certainly isn\u0027t concerned about Miriam\u0027s survival or the fact that Pam has never asked to create a child before. After all these years of service, Pam deserves to be granted the right.\" \"Victor\u0027s not letting Pam have Miriam out of sheer cussedness?\" Eric nodded. \"He has a bullshit excuse about there being enough vampires in my sheriffdom, when actually my numbers are low. The truth is that Victor will block us any way he can for as long as he can, in the hope that I\u0027ll do something injudicious enough to warrant being removed as sheriff, or killed.\" \"Surely Felipe wouldn\u0027t let that happen.\" Eric hoisted me onto his lap and held me to his cool chest. His shirt was still open. \"Felipe would judge in Pam\u0027s favor if he were on the spot, but I\u0027m sure he wants to stay out of the situation if he can. It\u0027s what I\u0027d do. He\u0027s setting up Red Rita in Arkansas and she\u0027s never ruled, he knows Victor is sulking about being appointed regent rather than king in Louisiana, and he is busy himself in Las Vegas, which he\u0027s running on a skeleton crew since he\u0027s sent people out to both his new states. Consolidating this big an empire hasn\u0027t been done in hundreds of years--and the last time it was done, the population was only a fraction of what it is today.\" \"So Felipe\u0027s still in complete control of Nevada?\" \"Yes. For now.\" \"That sounds kind of ominous.\" \"When leaders are spread thin, the sharks gather round to see if they can take a bite.\" Unpleasant mental image. \"What sharks? Anyone we know?\" Eric looked away. \"Two other monarchs in Zeus. The Queen of Oklahoma, for one. And the King of Arizona.\" The vampires had split America into four territories, all named after ancient religions. Pretentious, huh? I lived in Amun Territory in the kingdom of Louisiana. \"I wish you were just an average vampire,\" I said, completely out of the blue. \"I wish you weren\u0027t a sheriff, or anything.\" \"You mean you wish I were like Bill.\" Ouch. \"No, because he\u0027s not average, either,\" I snapped. \"He\u0027s got the whole database thing going, and he\u0027s taught himself all about computers. He\u0027s sort of reinvented himself. I guess I mean I wish you were more like . . . Maxwell.\" Maxwell was a businessman. He wore suits. He turned up for his duty at the club without enthusiasm, and he flashed his fangs without the drama the tourists had come to see. He was boring, and he had a stick up his ass, though from time to time I\u0027d had a hint that his personal life was exotic. However, not interested in learning more about that. Eric rolled his eyes at me. \"Of course, I\u0027m so much like Maxwell. Let me start carrying a pocket calculator with me, and putting people to sleep with things like `variable annuities,\u0027 or whatever the hell it is he talks about.\" \"I get your point, Mr. Subtle,\" I said. The ice pack had done all the good it was going to, and I removed it from my yahoo palace and put it on the table. This was the most relaxed conversation we\u0027d had in forever. \"See, isn\u0027t this fun?\" I said, trying to get Eric to admit I\u0027d done the right thing, though I\u0027d gone about it wrong. \"Yes, so much fun. Until Victor snatches you up and drains you dry and then says, `But, Eric, she was no longer bonded to you, so I did not think you still wanted her!\u0027 And then he\u0027ll turn you against your will, and I\u0027ll have to watch you suffer being bound to him for the rest of your life. And mine.\" \"You really know how to make a girl feel special,\" I said. \"I love you,\" he said, as if he were reminding himself of a painful fact. \"And this situation with Pam has to end. If this girl Miriam dies, Pam may decide to leave, and I won\u0027t be able to stop her. In fact, I shouldn\u0027t. Though she\u0027s very useful.\" \"You\u0027re fond of her,\" I said. \"Come on, Eric. You love her. She\u0027s your kid.\" \"Yes, I am very fond of Pam,\" he said. \"I made a great choice. You were my other great choice.\" \"That\u0027s one of the nicest things anyone\u0027s ever said to me,\" I told him, choking up just a little. \"Don\u0027t cry!\" He waved his hands in front of him as if to ward off my tears. I swallowed hard. \"So, do you have a plan about Victor?\" I used Eric\u0027s shirttail to dab at my eyes. Eric looked grim. Well, grimmer. \"Every time I make one, I run up against an obstacle so large I have to discard the plan. Victor is very good at self-protection. I may have to openly attack him. If I kill him, if I win, then I\u0027ll have to stand trial.\" I shivered. \"Eric, if you fought with Victor alone, bare-handed, in an empty room, what do you think the outcome would be?\" \"He\u0027s very good,\" Eric said. And that was all he said. \"He might win?\" I said, testing the idea out loud. \"Yes,\" Eric said. He met my eyes. \"And what would happen to you and Pam afterward . . .\" \"I\u0027m not trying to bypass the fact that you would be dead, which would be the most important thing to me in that scenario,\" I said. \"But I\u0027m wondering why he would be so sure to hurt Pam and me afterward. What would be the point?\" \"The point would be the lesson he\u0027d be making to other vampires who might be thinking of trying to overthrow him.\" Eric\u0027s eyes focused on the mantelpiece, crowded with Stackhouse family pictures. He didn\u0027t want to look into my face when he said what he was going to tell me next. \"Heidi told me that two years ago, when Victor was still a sheriff in Nevada, in Reno . . . a new vampire named Chico talked back to him. Chico\u0027s father was dead, but his mother was still living, and in fact had married again and had other children. Victor had her abducted. To correct Chico\u0027s manners, he cut out the mother\u0027s tongue while Chico watched. He made Chico eat it.\" There was so much disturbing about that, that I had a hard time thinking it through. \"Vampires can\u0027t eat,\" I said. \"What . . . ?\" \"Chico was violently ill, and in fact threw up blood,\" Eric said. He still didn\u0027t meet my eyes. \"He became too weak to move. While he lay on the floor, his mother bled to death. He couldn\u0027t crawl to her to give her blood to save her.\" \"Heidi volunteered this story?\" \"Yes. I had asked her why she was so pleased she\u0027d been sent to Area Five.\" Heidi, a vamp who specialized in tracking, had become part of Eric\u0027s crew courtesy of Victor. Of course she was supposed to spy on Eric, and because that was not a secret, no one seemed to mind. I didn\u0027t know Heidi well, but I knew she had a living child, a drug addict in Reno, so I wasn\u0027t at all surprised that she\u0027d taken Victor\u0027s lesson to heart. Learning this would indeed cause any vampire with living relatives, or any human loved ones, to fear Victor. But they\u0027d also loathe him and want him dead--and this was the aspect Victor hadn\u0027t thought of, I guessed, when he\u0027d taught that lesson. \"Victor\u0027s either shortsighted or super cocky,\" I concluded out loud, and Eric nodded. \"Maybe both,\" he said. \"How\u0027d you feel when you heard that story?\" I asked. \"I . . . didn\u0027t want that to happen to you,\" he said. He gave me a puzzled face. \"What are you looking for, Sookie? What answer shall I give?\" Though I knew it was futile--knew I was barking up the wrong tree--I was looking for moral repugnance. I was looking for \"I would never be so cruel to a woman and her son.\" At the same time I was wanting a thousand-year-old vampire to be upset about the death of a human woman he hadn\u0027t known--a death he couldn\u0027t have prevented--I knew it was crazy, wrong, and bad that I myself was plotting to kill Victor. His complete absence was what I longed for. I had no doubt that if Pam called to say a safe had fallen on top of Victor, I would dance around with glee. \"That\u0027s okay,\" I said. \"Never mind.\" Eric gave me a dark look. He couldn\u0027t see the depth of my unhappiness--not now, not since the bond was severed. But he certainly knew me well enough to see that I wasn\u0027t content. I forced myself to address the problem at hand. \"You know who you should talk to,\" I said. \"Remember the night we went to Vampire\u0027s Kiss, that server who tipped me off about the fairy blood by just a look and a thought.\" Eric nodded. \"I hate to pull him in any further. But I don\u0027t see we have another choice. We have to do this with everything we\u0027ve got, or we\u0027re going down.\" \"Sometimes,\" Eric said, \"you astonish me.\" Sometimes--and not always in a good way--I astonished myself. Eric and I drove to Vampire\u0027s Kiss again. The parking lot was crowded, maybe not as much as it had been on our previous visit. We parked out back behind the club. If Victor was actually in the club that night, there\u0027d be no reason for him to check out the employee parking lot, and there\u0027d be no reason for him to remember which car was mine. While we waited, I got a text from Amelia telling me that they were back at the house, and how was I doing? \"Am ok,\" I texted back. \"We\u0027re good. C \u0026 D there?\" \"Yes,\" she replied. \"Sniffing porch, don\u0027t know why. Fairies! Got ur keys?\" I told her I did, but that I wasn\u0027t sure I\u0027d be home that night. We were a little closer to Shreveport than Bon Temps, and I\u0027d need to take Eric home unless he flew. But his car would be . . . Oh, well, that was why he always had a daytime guy. \"Did you replace Bobby yet?\" I asked. I hated to bring up a sore subject, but I wanted to know. \"Yes,\" Eric said. \"I hired a man two days ago. He came highly recommended.\" \"By whom?\" There was a silence. I looked over at my honeybun, instantly curious. For the life of me, I couldn\u0027t see why that was a critical question. \"By Bubba,\" Eric said. I could feel the smile all over my face. \"He\u0027s back! Where\u0027s he staying?\" \"Right now, he\u0027s staying with me,\" Eric said. \"When he asked after Bobby, I had to tell him what had happened. The next night Bubba brought me this person. He\u0027s teachable, I suppose.\" \"You don\u0027t sound too enthusiastic.\" \"He\u0027s a Were,\" Eric said, and I instantly understood Eric\u0027s attitude. The Weres and the vampires really don\u0027t get along. You\u0027d think that as the two largest supernatural groups they could form an alliance, but that doesn\u0027t happen. They\u0027re capable of cooperating on some mutually beneficial project for a short period of time, but after that they revert to distrust and dislike. \"Tell me about him,\" I said. \"Your assistant, that is.\" We didn\u0027t have anything else to do, and lately we hadn\u0027t had much time for general conversation. \"He\u0027s a black man,\" Eric said, as if he were saying the new assistant had brown eyes. Eric could remember, vividly, the first black man he ever saw . . . centuries before. \"He\u0027s a lone wolf, unaffiliated. Alcide has already made overtures to him about joining the Long Tooth pack, but I don\u0027t think he\u0027s interested, and of course now that he\u0027s taken the job with me, they won\u0027t be so anxious to have him.\" \"And this is the guy you hired? A Were, whom you don\u0027t trust and have to train? A guy who\u0027ll automatically piss off Alcide and the Long Tooth pack?\" \"He has an outstanding attribute,\" Eric said. \"Good! What is it?\" \"He can keep his mouth shut. And he hates Victor,\" Eric said. That made it a whole different shooting match. \"Why?\" I asked. \"I\u0027m assuming he has a good reason.\" \"I don\u0027t know what it is yet.\" \"But you\u0027re convinced he\u0027s not pulling some elaborate double whammy? That Victor didn\u0027t cleverly realize you\u0027d hire someone who hated him, so he primed this guy and shot him over to you?\" \"I\u0027m convinced,\" Eric said. \"But I want you to sit with him a while tomorrow.\" \"If I can get some sleep,\" I said, yawning wide enough for my jaws to be in danger of cracking. It was after two in the morning, and we\u0027d seen signs the bar was closing, but many of the employee cars were still waiting for their owners. \"Oh, Eric, there he is!\" I hardly recognized the server named Colton because he was wearing long khaki cargo shorts, flip-flops, and a green T-shirt with a pattern I couldn\u0027t discern. I kind of missed the loincloth. I started my car after Colton did, and when he pulled out of the parking lot, I waited a discreet moment and followed him. He turned right onto the access road and drove west toward Shreveport. However, he didn\u0027t go that far. He exited the interstate at Haughton. \"We\u0027re looking pretty damn conspicuous,\" I said. \"We need to talk to him.\" \"So, we\u0027re giving up on stealth, huh?\" Eric said, \"Yes.\" He didn\u0027t sound happy about it, but we didn\u0027t have that many choices. Colton\u0027s car, a Dodge Charger that had seen better days, turned into a narrow drive off a narrow road. He stopped in front of a goodsized trailer. He got out and stood by the car. His hand was down by his side, and I was pretty sure in that hand was a gun. \"Let me get out first,\" I said, as I pulled up beside the man. Before Eric could argue, I opened my car door and called, \"Colton! It\u0027s Sookie Stackhouse. You know who I am! I\u0027m standing up now, and I\u0027m not armed.\" \"Go slow.\" His voice was wary, and I couldn\u0027t blame him. \"Just so you know, Eric Northman is with me, but he\u0027s still in the car.\" \"Good.\" My hands reaching for the sky, I stepped away from the car so he could have a good look at me. The front porch light of the trailer was all he had to see by, but he gave me a thorough scan. While he was trying to pat me down with his eyes, the trailer door opened and a young woman stepped out on the added-on porch. \"Colton, what\u0027s going on?\" she asked in a nasal voice with a very \"country\" accent. \"We got some company. Don\u0027t worry about it,\" he said automatically. \"Who\u0027s she?\" \"The Stackhouse woman.\" \"Sookie?\" The voice sounded startled. \"Yeah,\" I said. \"Do I know you? I can\u0027t see you that well.\" \"It\u0027s Audrina Loomis,\" she said. \"You remember? I went out with your brother for a while in high school.\" So did half the girls in Bon Temps, so that didn\u0027t really narrow my memory down. \"It\u0027s been a while,\" I said carefully. \"He still single?\" \"Yeah,\" I said. \"Oh, by the way, can my boyfriend get out now?\" Since we were all being just folks here. \"Who\u0027s he?\" \"His name\u0027s Eric; he\u0027s a vampire.\" \"Cool. Sure, let\u0027s have a look.\" Audrina seemed to be a little more reckless than Colton. On the other hand, Colton had warned me about the fairy blood. Eric got out of my car, and there was a moment of impressed silence while Audrina absorbed Eric\u0027s magnificence. \"Well, okay,\" Audrina said, clearing her throat as though it had gone suddenly dry. \"You two wanna come in and let us know what you\u0027re doing here?\" \"You think that\u0027s smart?\" Colton asked her. \"He coulda killed us about six times already.\" Audrina was not as dumb as she sounded. When we were all in the trailer and Eric and I were sitting on the couch, which had been covered with an old chenille bedspread and was missing several crucial springs, I got a good look at Audrina. Her roots were dark. The rest of her shoulder-length hair was platinum blond. She was wearing a nightgown that hadn\u0027t really been designed for sleeping in. It was red and mostly sheer. She\u0027d been waiting up for Colton with more on her mind than conversation. Now that I wasn\u0027t distracted by a leather loincloth and his startling eyes, Colton was much more of an average guy. Some men just can\u0027t radiate sexual attraction unless they take their clothes off, and Colton was such a man. But his eyes were definitely unusual, and he was practically giving me a laser treatment with them now, though not in a sexy way. \"We don\u0027t have any blood,\" Audrina said. \"Sorry.\" She didn\u0027t offer me anything to drink. She was doing this on purpose, her brain told me. She didn\u0027t want this to seem in any way like a social occasion. Okay. \"Eric and I want to know why you warned us,\" I said to Colton. And I wanted to know why I\u0027d thought about him when Eric had told me the story of Chico and his mother. \"I heard about you,\" he said. \"Heidi told me.\" \"You and Heidi are friends?\" Eric was intent on Colton, but he spared one of his best smiles for Audrina. \"Yeah,\" Colton said. \"I worked for Felipe at a club in Reno. I knew Heidi from there.\" \"You moved from Reno to take a low-paying job in Louisiana?\" That didn\u0027t make any sense. \"Audrina was from here, and she wanted to try living here again,\" Colton explained. \"Her grandma lives in the trailer down the road, and she\u0027s pretty frail. Audrina works at Vic\u0027s Redneck Roadhouse during the day as a bookkeeper. I work at night at Vampire\u0027s Kiss. And the cost of living is a lot cheaper here. But you\u0027re right, there\u0027s more to the story.\" He glanced at his girlfriend. \"We came for a reason,\" Audrina said. \"Colton is Chico\u0027s brother.\" Eric and I both took a second to work that out. \"So it was your mom,\" I said to the young man. \"I\u0027m so sorry.\" Though I hadn\u0027t heard any more of the story, the name had been enough to snag in my brain. \"Yeah, it was my mom,\" Colton said. He gave us an entirely blank stare. \"My brother Chico is an asshole who didn\u0027t think twice about becoming a vampire. He gave up his life like some lesser asshole would get a tattoo. `It\u0027s cool, let\u0027s do it!\u0027 And then he kept on being an asshole, talking shit to Victor, not understanding. Not getting it.\" Colton put his head in his hands and shook it from side to side. \"Until that night. Then he got it. But our mom was dead. And Chico wishes he was, but he won\u0027t ever be.\" \"And how come Victor doesn\u0027t know who you are, know to be leery of you?\" \"Chico had a different dad, so he had a different last name,\" Audrina said, to give Colton time to recover. \"And Chico wasn\u0027t a family type guy. He hadn\u0027t lived at home for ten years. He only called his mom once every couple of months, never went to see them. But that was enough to give Victor the bright idea of reminding Chico he hadn\u0027t signed a contract with the California Angels.\" \"More like Hell\u0027s Angels,\" Colton said, straightening. If the comparison bothered Eric, he didn\u0027t let on. I was sure it wasn\u0027t the worst he\u0027d heard. \"So thanks to Victor\u0027s employee,\" Eric began, \"you knew about my Sookie. And you knew how to warn her when Victor was going to poison us.\" Colton looked angry. Shouldn\u0027t have, he thought. \"Yes, you did what you ought to do,\" I said, maybe a little huffily. \"We\u0027re people, too.\" \"You are,\" Eric said, reading Colton\u0027s expression as accurately as I read his thoughts. \"But Pam and I aren\u0027t. Colton, I want to thank you for your warning, and I want to reward you. What can I do for you?\" \"You can kill Victor,\" Colton said immediately. \"How interesting.
