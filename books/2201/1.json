She was my biggest fan and my most faithful reader. There was so much to admire about my mother. I miss her every day. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS I am afraid I\u0027ll skip someone this time around, because I am fortunate enough to have a lot of great help as I work on these books. Let me thank my assistant and best friend, Paula Woldan, first and foremost, for allowing me the peace of mind to work without worry; my friends and readers Toni L. P. Kelner and Dana Cameron, who help me focus on the important aspects of the work at hand; Victoria Koski, who tries to keep the huge world of Sookie in order; and my agent, Joshua Bilmes, and my editor, Ginjer Buchanan, who work so hard to keep my professional train on the tracks. For this book, I had the excellent advice of Ellen Dugan, writer, mother, and witch. Chapter 1 The attic had been kept locked until the day after my grandmother died. I\u0027d found her key and opened it that awful day to look for her wedding dress, having the crazy idea she should be buried in it. I\u0027d taken one step inside and then turned and walked out, leaving the door unsecured behind me. Now, two years later, I pushed that door open again. The hinges creaked as ominously as if it were midnight on Halloween instead of a sunny Wednesday morning in late May. The broad floorboards protested under my feet as I stepped over the threshold. There were dark shapes all around me, and a very faint musty odor--the smell of old things long forgotten. When the second story had been added to the original Stackhouse home decades before, the new floor had been divided into bedrooms, but perhaps a third of it had been relegated to storage space after the largest generation of Stackhouses had thinned out. Since Jason and I had come to live with my grandparents after our parents had died, the attic door had been kept locked. Gran hadn\u0027t wanted to clean up after us if we decided the attic was a great place to play. Now I owned the house, and the key was on a ribbon around my neck. There were only three Stackhouse descendants--Jason, me, and my deceased cousin Hadley\u0027s son, a little boy named Hunter. I waved my hand around in the shadowy gloom to find the hanging chain, grasped it, and pulled. An overhead bulb illuminated decades of family castoffs. Cousin Claude and Great-Uncle Dermot stepped in behind me. Dermot exhaled so loudly it was almost a snort. Claude looked grim. I was sure he was regretting his offer to help me clean out the attic. But I wasn\u0027t going to let my cousin off the hook, not when there was another able-bodied male available to help. For now, Dermot went where Claude went, so I had two for the price of one. I couldn\u0027t predict how long the situation would hold. I\u0027d suddenly realized that morning that soon it would be too hot to spend time in the upstairs room. The window unit my friend Amelia had installed in one of the bedrooms kept the living spaces tolerable, but of course we\u0027d never wasted money putting one in the attic. \"How shall we go about this?\" Dermot asked. He was blond and Claude was dark; they looked like gorgeous bookends. I\u0027d asked Claude once how old he was, to find he had only the vaguest idea. The fae don\u0027t keep track of time the same way we do, but Claude was at least a century older than me. He was a kid compared to Dermot; my great-uncle thought he was seven hundred years my senior. Not a wrinkle, not a gray hair, not a droop anywhere, on either of them. Since they were much more fairy than me--I was only one-eighth--we all seemed to be about the same age, our late twenties. But that would change in a few years. I would look older than my ancient kin. Though Dermot looked very like my brother, Jason, I\u0027d realized the day before that Jason had crow\u0027s-feet at the corners of his eyes. Dermot might not ever show even that token of aging. Pulling myself back into the here and now, I said, \"I suggest we carry things down to the living room. It\u0027s so much brighter down there; it\u0027ll be easier to see what\u0027s worth keeping and what isn\u0027t. After we get everything out of the attic, I can clean it up after you two leave for work.\" Claude owned a strip club in Monroe and drove over every day, and Dermot went where Claude went. As always . . . \"We\u0027ve got three hours,\" Claude said. \"Let\u0027s get to work,\" I said, my lips curving upward in a bright and cheerful smile. That\u0027s my fallback expression. About an hour later, I was having second thoughts, but it was too late to back out of the task. (Getting to watch Claude and Dermot shirtless made the work a lot more interesting.) My family has lived in this house since there have been Stackhouses in Renard Parish. And that\u0027s been well over a hundred and fifty years. We\u0027ve saved things. The living room began to fill up in a hurry. There were boxes of books, trunks full of clothes, furniture, vases. The Stackhouse family had never been rich, and apparently we\u0027d always thought we could find a use for anything, no matter how battered or broken, if we kept it long enough. Even the two fairies wanted to take a break after maneuvering an incredibly heavy wooden desk down the narrow staircase. We all sat on the front porch. The guys sat on the railing, and I slumped down on the swing. \"We could just pile it all in the yard and burn it,\" Claude suggested. He wasn\u0027t joking. Claude\u0027s sense of humor was quirky at best, minuscule the rest of the time. \"No!\" I tried not to sound as irritated as I felt. \"I know this stuff is not valuable, but if other Stackhouses thought it ought to be stored up there, I at least owe them the courtesy of having a look at all of it.\" \"Dearest great-niece,\" Dermot said, \"I\u0027m afraid Claude has a point. Saying this debris is `not valuable\u0027 is being kind.\" Once you heard Dermot talk, you knew his resemblance to Jason was strictly superficial. I glowered at the fairies. \"Of course to you two most of this would be trash, but to humans it might have some value,\" I said. \"I may call the theater group in Shreveport to see if they want any of the clothes or furniture.\" Claude shrugged. \"That\u0027ll get rid of some of it,\" he said. \"But most of the fabric isn\u0027t even good for rags.\" We\u0027d put some boxes out on the porch when the living room began to be impassable, and he poked one with his toe. The label said the contents were curtains, but I could only guess what they\u0027d originally looked like. \"You\u0027re right,\" I admitted. I pushed with my feet, not too energetically, and swung for a minute. Dermot went in the house and returned with a glass of peach tea with lots of ice in it. He handed it to me silently. I thanked him and stared dismally at all the old things someone had once treasured. \"Okay, we\u0027ll start a burn pile,\" I said, bowing to common sense. \"Round back, where I usually burn the leaves?\" Dermot and Claude glared at me. \"Okay, right here on the gravel is fine,\" I said. The last time my driveway had been graveled, the parking area in front of the house, outlined with landscape timbers, had gotten a fresh load, too. \"It\u0027s not like I get a lot of visitors.\" By the time Dermot and Claude knocked off to shower and change for work, the parking area contained a substantial mound of useless items waiting for the torch. Stackhouse wives had stored extra sheets and coverlets, and most of them were in the same ragged condition as the curtains. To my deeper regret, many of the books were mildewed and mouse-chewed. I sighed and added them to the pile, though the very idea of burning books made me queasy. But broken furniture, rotted umbrellas, spotted place mats, an ancient leather suitcase with big holes in it . . . no one would ever need these items again. The pictures we\u0027d uncovered--framed, in albums, or loose--we placed in a box in the living room. Documents were sorted into another box. I\u0027d found some old dolls, too. I knew from television that people collected dolls, and perhaps these were worth something. There were some old guns, too, and a sword. Where was Antiques Roadshow when you needed it? Later that evening at Merlotte\u0027s, I told my boss Sam about my day. Sam, a compact man who was actually immensely strong, was dusting the bottles behind the bar. We weren\u0027t very busy that night. In fact, business hadn\u0027t been good for the past few weeks. I didn\u0027t know if the slump was due to the chicken processing plant closing or the fact that some people objected to Sam being a shapeshifter. (The two-natured had tried to emulate the successful transition of the vampires, but it hadn\u0027t gone so well.) And there was a new bar, Vic\u0027s Redneck Roadhouse, about ten miles west off the interstate. I\u0027d heard the Redneck Roadhouse held all kinds of wet T-shirt contests, beer pong tournaments, and a promotion called \"Bring in a Bubba Night\"--crap like that. Popular crap. Crap that raked in the customers. Whatever the reasons, Sam and I had time to talk about attics and antiques. \"There\u0027s a store called Splendide in Shreveport,\" Sam said. \"Both the owners are appraisers. You could give them a call.\" \"How\u0027d you know that?\" Okay, maybe that wasn\u0027t so tactful. \"Well, I do know a few things besides tending bar,\" Sam said, giving me a sideways look. I had to refill a pitcher of beer for one of my tables. When I returned, I said, \"Of course you know all kinds of stuff. I just didn\u0027t know you were into antiques.\" \"I\u0027m not. But Jannalynn is. Splendide\u0027s her favorite place to shop.\" I blinked, trying not to look as disconcerted as I felt. Jannalynn Hopper, who\u0027d been dating Sam for a few weeks now, was so ferocious she\u0027d been named the Long Tooth pack enforcer--though she was only twenty-one and about as big as a seventh grader. It was hard to imagine Jannalynn restoring a vintage picture frame or planning to fit a plantation sideboard into her place in Shreveport. (Come to think of it, I had no idea where she lived. Did Jannalynn actually have a house?) \"I sure wouldn\u0027t have guessed that,\" I said, making myself smile at Sam. It was my personal opinion that Jannalynn was not good enough for Sam. Of course, I kept that to myself. Glass houses, stones, right? I was dating a vampire whose kill list would top Jannalynn\u0027s for sure, since Eric was over a thousand years old. In one of those awful moments you have at random, I realized that everyone I\u0027d ever dated--though, granted, that was a short list--was a killer. And so was I. I had to shake this off in a hurry, or I\u0027d be in a melancholy funk all evening. \"You have a name and phone number for this shop?\" I hoped the antiques dealers would agree to come to Bon Temps. I\u0027d have to rent a U-Haul to get all the attic contents to Shreveport. \"Yeah, I got it in my office,\" Sam said. \"I was talking to Brenda, the female half of the partnership, about getting Jannalynn something special for her birthday. It\u0027s coming right up. Brenda--Brenda Hesterman--called this morning to tell me she had a few things for me to look at.\" \"Maybe we could go see her tomorrow?\" I suggested. \"I have things piled all over the living room and some out on the front porch, and the good weather won\u0027t last forever.\" \"Would Jason want any of it?\" Sam asked diffidently. \"I\u0027m just saying, family stuff.\" \"He got a piecrust table around a month ago,\" I said. \"But I guess I should ask him.\" I thought about it. The house and its contents were mine, since Gran had left it to me. Hmmmm. Well, first things first. \"Let\u0027s ask Ms. Hesterman if she\u0027ll come give a look. If there\u0027s pieces that are worth anything, I can think about it.\" \"Okay,\" Sam said. \"Sounds good. Pick you up tomorrow at ten?\" That was a little early for me to be up and dressed since I was working the late shift, but I agreed. Sam sounded pleased. \"You can tell me what you think about whatever Brenda shows me. It\u0027ll be good to have a woman\u0027s opinion.\" He ran a hand over his hair, which (as usual) was a mess. A few weeks ago he\u0027d cut it real short, and now it was in an awkward stage of growing back. Sam\u0027s hair is a pretty color, sort of strawberry blond; but since it\u0027s naturally curly, now that it was growing out it couldn\u0027t seem to pick a direction. I suppressed an urge to whip out a brush and make sense out of it. That was not something an employee should do to her boss\u0027s head. Kennedy Keyes and Danny Prideaux, who worked for Sam parttime as substitute bartender and bouncer, respectively, came in to climb on two of the empty barstools. Kennedy is beautiful. She was first runner-up to Miss Louisiana a few years ago, and she still looks like a beauty pageant queen. Her chestnut hair\u0027s all glossy and thick, and the ends wouldn\u0027t dare to split. Her makeup is meticulous. She has manicures and pedicures on a regular basis. She wouldn\u0027t buy a garment at Wal-Mart if her life depended on it. A few years ago her future, which should have included a country club marriage in the next parish and a big inheritance from her daddy, had been derailed from its path when she\u0027d served time for manslaughter. Along with pretty nearly everyone I knew, I figured her boyfriend had had it coming, after I saw the pictures of her face swelling black-and-blue in her mug shots. But she\u0027d confessed to shooting him when she called 911, and his family had a little clout, so there was no way Kennedy could walk. She\u0027d gotten a light sentence and time off for good behavior, since she\u0027d taught deportment and grooming to the other inmates. Eventually, Kennedy had done her time. When she\u0027d gotten out, she\u0027d rented a little apartment in Bon Temps, where she had an aunt, Marcia Albanese. Sam had offered her a job pretty much right after he met her, and she\u0027d accepted on the spot. \"Hey, man,\" Danny said to Sam. \"Fix us two mojitos?\" Sam got the mint out of the refrigerator and set to work. I handed him the sliced limes when he was almost through with the drinks. \"What are you all up to tonight?\" I asked. \"You look mighty pretty, Kennedy.\" \"I finally lost ten pounds!\" she said, and when Sam deposited her glass in front of her, she lifted it to toast with Danny. \"To my former figure! May I be on the road to getting it back!\" Danny shook his head. He said, \"Hey! You don\u0027t need to do anything to look beautiful.\" I had to turn away so I wouldn\u0027t say, Aw.w.ww. Danny was one tough guy who couldn\u0027t have grown up in a more different environment than Kennedy--the only experience they\u0027d had in common was jail--but boy, he was carrying a big torch for her. I could feel the heat from where I stood. You didn\u0027t have to be telepathic to see Danny\u0027s devotion. We hadn\u0027t drawn the curtains on the front window yet, and when I realized it was dark outside, I started forward. Though I was looking out from the bright bar to the dark parking lot, there were lights out there, and something was moving . . . moving fast. Toward the bar. I had a slice of a second to think Odd, and then caught the flicker of flame. \"Down!\" I yelled, but the word hadn\u0027t even gotten all the way out of my mouth when the window shattered and the bottle with its fiery head landed on a table where no one was sitting, breaking the napkin holder and scattering the salt and pepper shakers. Burning napkins flared out from the point of impact to drift down to the floor and the chairs and the people. The table itself was a mass of fire almost instantly. Danny moved faster than I\u0027d ever seen a human move. He swept Kennedy off her stool, flipped up the pass-through, and shoved her down behind the bar. There was a brief logjam as Sam, moving even faster, grabbed the fire extinguisher from the wall and tried to leap through the pass-through to start spraying. I felt heat on my thighs and looked down to see that my apron had been ignited by one of the napkins. I\u0027m ashamed to say that I screamed. Sam swiveled around to spray me and then turned back to the flames. The customers were yelling, dodging flames, running into the passage that led past the bathrooms and Sam\u0027s office through to the back parking lot. One of our perpetual customers, Jane Bodehouse, was bleeding heavily, her hand clapped to her lacerated scalp. She\u0027d been sitting by the window, not her usual place at the bar, so I figured she\u0027d been cut by flying glass. Jane staggered and would have fallen if I hadn\u0027t grabbed her arm. \"Go that way,\" I yelled in her ear, and shoved her in the right direction. Sam was spraying the biggest flame, aiming at the base of it in the approved manner, but the napkins that had floated away were causing lots of little fires. I grabbed the pitcher of water and the pitcher of tea off the bar and began methodically tracking the flames on the floor. The pitchers were full, and I managed to be pretty effective. One of the window curtains was on fire, and I took three steps, aimed carefully, and tossed the remaining tea. The flame didn\u0027t quite die out. I grabbed a glass of water from a table and got much closer to the fire than I wanted to. Flinching the whole time, I poured the liquid down the steaming curtain. I felt an odd flicker of warmth behind me and smelled something disgusting. A powerful gust of chemicals made a strange sensation against my back. I turned to try to figure out what had happened and saw Sam whirling away with the extinguisher. I found myself looking through the serving hatch into the kitchen. Antoine, the cook, was shutting down all the appliances. Smart. I could hear the fire engine in the distance, but I was too busy looking for yellow flickers to feel much relief. My eyes, streaming with tears from the smoke and the chemicals, were darting around like pinballs as I tried to spot flames, and I was coughing like crazy. Sam had run to retrieve the second extinguisher from his office, and he returned holding it ready. We rocked from side to side on our feet, ready to leap into action to extinguish the next flicker. Neither of us spotted anything else. Sam aimed one more blast at the bottle that had caused the fire, and then he put down the extinguisher. He leaned over to plant his hands on his thighs and inhaled raggedly. He began coughing. After a second, he bent down to the bottle. \"Don\u0027t touch it,\" I said urgently, and his hand stopped halfway down. \"Of course not,\" he said, chiding himself, and he straightened up. \"Did you see who threw it?\" \"No,\" I said. We were the only people left in the bar. I could hear the fire engine getting closer and closer, so I knew we had only a minute more to talk to each other alone. \"Coulda been the same people who\u0027ve been demonstrating out in the parking lot. I don\u0027t know that the church members are into firebombs, though.\" Not everyone in the area was pleased to know there were such creatures as werewolves and shapeshifters following the Great Reveal, and the Holy Word Tabernacle in Clarice had been sending its members to demonstrate at Merlotte\u0027s from time to time. \"Sookie,\" Sam said, \"sorry about your hair.\" \"What about it?\" I said, lifting my hand to my head. The shock was setting in now. I had a hard time making my hand mind my directions. \"The end of your ponytail got singed,\" Sam said. And he sat down very suddenly. That seemed like a good idea. \"So that\u0027s what smells so bad,\" I said, and collapsed on the floor beside him. We had our backs against the base of the bar, since the stools had gotten scattered in the melee of the rush out the back door. My hair was burned off. I felt tears run down my cheeks. I knew it was stupid, but I couldn\u0027t help it. Sam took my hand and gripped it, and we were still sitting like that when the firefighters rushed in. Even though Merlotte\u0027s is outside the city limits, we got the official town firefighters, not the volunteers. \"I don\u0027t think you need the hose,\" Sam called. \"I think it\u0027s out.\" He was anxious to prevent any more damage to the bar. Truman La Salle, the fire chief, said, \"You two need first aid?\" But his eyes were busy, and his words were almost absentminded. \"I\u0027m okay,\" I said, after a glance at Sam. \"But Jane\u0027s out back with a cut on her head, from the glass. Sam?\" \"Maybe my right hand got a little burned,\" he said, and his mouth compressed as if he was just now feeling the pain. He released my hand to rub his left over his right, and he definitely winced this time. \"You need to take care of that,\" I advised him. \"Burns hurt like the devil.\" \"Yeah, I\u0027m figuring that out,\" he said, his eyes squeezing shut. Bud Dearborn came in as soon as Truman yelled, \"Okay!\" The sheriff must have been in bed, because he had a thrown-together look and was minus his hat, a reliable part of his wardrobe. Sheriff Dearborn was probably in his late fifties by now, and he showed every minute of it. He\u0027d always looked like a Pekinese. Now he looked like a gray one. He spent a few minutes going around the bar, watching where his feet went, almost sniffing the disarray. Finally he was satisfied and came up to stand in front of me. \"What you been up to now?\" he asked. \"Someone threw a firebomb in the window,\" I said. \"None of my doing.\" I was too shocked to sound angry. \"Sam, they aiming for you?\" the sheriff asked. He wandered off without waiting for an answer. Sam got up slowly and turned to reach his left hand to me. I gripped it and he pulled. Since Sam\u0027s much stronger than he looks, I was on my feet in a jiffy. Time stood still for a few minutes. I had to think that I was maybe a bit in shock. As Sheriff Dearborn completed his slow and careful circuit of the bar, he arrived back at Sam and me. By then we had another sheriff to deal with. Eric Northman, my boyfriend and the vampire sheriff of Area Five, which included Bon Temps, came through the door so quickly that when Bud and Truman realized he was there, they jumped, and I thought Bud was going to draw his weapon. Eric gripped my shoulders and bent to peer into my face. \"Are you hurt?\" he demanded. It was like his concern gave me permission to drop my bravery. I felt a tear run down my cheek. Just one. \"My apron caught fire, but I think my legs are okay,\" I said, making a huge effort to sound calm. \"I only lost a little hair. So I didn\u0027t come out of it too bad. Bud, Truman, I can\u0027t remember if you\u0027ve met my boyfriend, Eric Northman from Shreveport.\" There were several iffy facts in that sentence. \"How\u0027d you know there was trouble here, Mr. Northman?\" Truman asked. \"Sookie called me on her cell phone,\" Eric said. That was a lie, but I didn\u0027t exactly want to explain our blood bond to our fire chief and our sheriff, and Eric would never volunteer any information to humans. One of the most wonderful, and the most appalling, things about Eric loving me was that he didn\u0027t give a shit about anyone else. He ignored the damaged bar, Sam\u0027s burns, and the police and firefighters (who were keeping track of him from the corners of their eyes) still inspecting the building. Eric circled me to evaluate the hair situation. After a long moment, he said, \"I\u0027m going to look at your legs. Then we\u0027ll find a doctor and a beautician.\" His voice was absolutely cold and steady, but I knew he was volcanically angry. It rolled through the bond between us, just as my fear and shock had alerted him to my danger. \"Honey, we have other things to think about,\" I said, forcing myself to smile, forcing myself to sound calm. One corner of my brain pictured a pink ambulance screeching to a halt outside to disgorge emergency beauticians with cases of scissors, combs, and hair spray. \"Dealing with a little hair damage can wait until tomorrow. It\u0027s a lot more important to find out who did this and why.\" Eric glared at Sam as if the attack were Sam\u0027s responsibility. \"Yes, his bar is far more important than your safety and well-being,\" he said. Sam looked astonished at this rebuke, and the beginnings of anger flickered across his face. \"If Sam hadn\u0027t been so quick with the fire extinguisher, we\u0027d all have been in bad shape,\" I said, keeping up with the calm and the smiling. \"In fact, both the bar and the people in it would have been in a lot more trouble.\" I was running out of faux serenity, and of course Eric realized it. \"I\u0027m taking you home,\" he said. \"Not until I talk to her.\" Bud showed considerable courage in asserting himself. Eric was scary enough when he was in a good mood, much less when his fangs ran out as they did now. Strong emotion does that to a vamp. \"Honey,\" I said, holding on to my own temper with an effort. I put my arm around Eric\u0027s waist, and tried again. \"Honey, Bud and Truman are in charge here, and they have their rules to follow. I\u0027m okay.\" Though I was trembling, which of course he could feel. \"You were frightened,\" Eric said. I felt his own rage that something had happened to me that he had not been able to prevent. I suppressed a sigh at having to babysit Eric\u0027s emotions when I wanted to be free to have my own nervous breakdown. Vampires are nothing if not possessive when they\u0027ve claimed someone as theirs, but they\u0027re also usually anxious to blend into the human population, not cause any unnecessary waves. This was an overreaction. Eric was mad, sure, but normally he was also quite pragmatic. He knew I wasn\u0027t seriously hurt. I looked up at him, puzzled. My big Viking hadn\u0027t been himself in a week or two. Something other than the death of his maker was bothering him, but I hadn\u0027t built up enough courage to ask him what was wrong. I\u0027d cut myself some slack. I\u0027d simply wanted to enjoy the peace we\u0027d shared for a few weeks. Maybe that had been a mistake. Something big was pressing on him, and all this anger was a by-product. \"How\u0027d you get here so quick?\" Bud asked Eric. \"I flew,\" Eric said casually, and Bud and Truman gave each other a wide-eyed look. Eric had had the ability for (give or take) a thousand years, so he disregarded their amazement. He was focused on me, his fangs still out. They couldn\u0027t know that Eric had felt the swell of my terror the minute I\u0027d seen the running figure. I hadn\u0027t had to call him when the incident was over. \"The sooner we get all this settled,\" I said, baring my teeth right back at him in a terrible smile, \"the sooner we can leave.\" I was trying, not so subtly, to send Eric a message. He finally calmed down enough to get my subtext. \"Of course, my darling,\" he said. \"You\u0027re absolutely right.\" But his hand took mine and squeezed too hard, and his eyes were so brilliant they looked like little blue lanterns. Bud and Truman looked mighty relieved. The tension ratcheted down a few notches. Vampires \u003d drama. While Sam was getting his hand treated and Truman was taking pictures of what remained of the bottle, Bud asked me what I\u0027d seen. \"I caught a glimpse of someone out in the parking lot running toward the building, and then the bottle came through the window,\" I said. \"I don\u0027t know who threw it. After the window broke and the fire spread from all the lit napkins, I didn\u0027t notice anything but the people trying to leave and Sam trying to put it out.\" Bud asked me the same thing several times in several different ways, but I couldn\u0027t help him any more than I already had. \"Why do you think someone would do this to Merlotte\u0027s, to Sam?\" Bud asked. \"I don\u0027t understand it,\" I said. \"You know, we had those demonstrators from the church in the parking lot a few weeks ago. They\u0027ve only come back once since then. I can\u0027t imagine any of them making a--was that a Molotov cocktail?\" \"How do you know about those, Sookie?\" \"Well, one, I read books. Two, Terry doesn\u0027t talk about the war much, but every now and then he does talk about weapons.\" Terry Bellefleur, Detective Andy Bellefleur\u0027s cousin, was a decorated and damaged Vietnam veteran. He cleaned the bar when everyone was gone and came in occasionally to substitute for Sam. Sometimes he just hung at the bar watching people come in and out. Terry did not have much of a social life. As soon as Bud declared himself satisfied, Eric and I went to my car. He took the keys from my shaking hand. I got in the passenger side. He was right. I shouldn\u0027t drive until I\u0027d recovered from the shock. Eric had been busy on his cell phone while I was talking to Bud, and I wasn\u0027t totally surprised to see a car parked in front of my house. It was Pam\u0027s, and she had a passenger. Eric pulled around back where I always park, and I scrambled out of the car to hurry through the house to unlock the front door. Eric followed me at a leisurely pace. We hadn\u0027t exchanged a word on the short drive. He was preoccupied and still dealing with his temper. I was shocked by the whole incident. Now I felt a little more like myself as I went out on the porch to call, \"Come in!\" Pam and her passenger got out. He was a young human, maybe twenty-one, and thin to the point of emaciation. His hair was dyed blue and cut in an extremely geometric way, rather as if he\u0027d put a box on his head, knocked it sideways, then trimmed around the edges. What didn\u0027t fit inside the lines had been shaved. It was eye-catching, I\u0027ll say that. Pam smiled at the expression on my face, which I hastily transformed into something more welcoming. Pam has been a vampire since Victoria was on the English throne, and she\u0027s been Eric\u0027s right hand since he called her in from her wanderings in northern America. He\u0027s her maker. \"Hello,\" I said to the young man as he entered the front door. He was extremely nervous. His eyes darted to me, away from me, took in Eric, and then kind of strafed the room to absorb it. A flicker of contempt crossed his clean-shaven face as he took in the cluttered living room, which was never more than homey even when it was clean. Pam thumped him on the back of his head. \"Speak when you\u0027re spoken to, Immanuel!\" she growled. She was standing slightly behind him, so he couldn\u0027t see her when she winked at me. \"Hello, ma\u0027am,\" he said to me, taking a step forward. His nose twitched. Pam said, \"You smell, Sookie.\" \"It was the fire,\" I explained. \"You can tell me about it in a moment,\" she said, her pale eyebrows shooting up. \"Sookie, this man is Immanuel Earnest,\" she said. \"He cuts hair at Death by Fashion in Shreveport. He\u0027s brother to my lover, Miriam.\" That was a lot of information in three sentences. I scrambled to absorb it. Eric was eyeing Immanuel\u0027s coiffure with fascinated disgust. \"This is the one you brought to correct Sookie\u0027s hair?\" he said to Pam. His lips were pressed together in a very tight line. I could feel his skepticism pulsing along the line that bound us. \"Miriam says he is the best,\" Pam said, shrugging. \"I haven\u0027t had a haircut in a hundred fifty years. How would I know?\" \"Look at him!\" I began to be a little worried. Even for the circumstances, Eric was in a foul mood. \"I like his tattoos,\" I said. \"The colors are real pretty.\" Aside from his extreme haircut, Immanuel was covered with very sophisticated tattoos. No \"MOM\" or \"BETTY SUE\" or naked ladies; elaborate and colorful designs extended from wrists to shoulders. He\u0027d look dressed even when he was naked. The hairdresser had a flat leather case tucked under one of his skinny arms. \"So, you\u0027re going to cut off the bad parts?\" I said brightly. \"Of your hair,\" he said carefully. (I wasn\u0027t sure I\u0027d needed that particular reassurance.) He glanced at me, then back down at the floor. \"Do you have a high stool?\" \"Yes, in the kitchen,\" I said. When I\u0027d rebuilt my burned-out kitchen, custom had made me buy a high stool like the one my gran had perched on while she talked on the old telephone. The new phone was cordless, and I didn\u0027t need to stay in the kitchen when I used it, but the counter simply hadn\u0027t looked right without a stool beside it. My three guests trailed behind me, and I dragged the stool into the middle of the floor. There was just enough room for everyone when Pam and Eric sat on the other side of the table. Eric was glowering at Immanuel in an ominous way, and Pam was simply waiting to be entertained by our emotional upheavals. I clambered up on the stool and made myself sit with a straight back. My legs were smarting, my eyes were prickly, and my throat was scratchy. But I forced myself to smile at the hairstylist. Immanuel was real nervous. You don\u0027t want that in a person with sharp scissors. Immanuel took the elastic band off my ponytail. There was a long silence while he regarded the damage. He wasn\u0027t thinking good thoughts. My vanity got hold of me. \"Is it very bad?\" I asked, trying to keep my voice from quavering. Reaction was definitely getting the upper hand, now that I was safe at home. \"I\u0027m going to have to take off about three inches,\" he said quietly, as if he were telling me a relative was terminally ill. To my shame, I reacted much the same way as if that had been the news. I could feel tears well up in my eyes, and my lips were quivering. Ridiculous! I told myself. My eyes slewed left when Immanuel set his leather case on the kitchen table. He unzipped it and took out a comb. There were also several pairs of scissors in special loops and an electric trimmer with its cord neatly coiled. Have hair care, will travel. Pam was texting with incredible speed. She was smiling as though her message were pretty damn funny. Eric stared at me, thinking many dark thoughts. I couldn\u0027t read \u0027em, but I could sure tell he was unhappy in a major way. I sighed and returned my gaze to straight ahead. I loved Eric, but at the moment I wanted him to take his broodiness and shove it. I felt Immanuel\u0027s touch on my hair as he began combing. It felt strange when he reached the end of its length, and a little tug and a funny sound let me know that some of my burned hair had fallen to the floor. \"It\u0027s damaged beyond repair,\" Immanuel murmured. \"I\u0027ll cut. Then you wash. Then I cut again.\" \"You must quit this job,\" Eric said abruptly, and Immanuel\u0027s comb stopped moving until he realized Eric was talking to me. I wanted to throw something heavy at my honeybun. And I wanted it to smack him right in his stubborn, handsome head. \"We\u0027ll talk later,\" I said, not looking at him. \"What will happen next? You\u0027re too vulnerable!\" \"We\u0027ll talk later.\" Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Pam look away so Eric wouldn\u0027t see her smirk. \"Doesn\u0027t she need something around her?\" Eric snarled at Immanuel. \"Covering her clothes?\" \"Eric,\" I said, \"since I\u0027m all smelly and smoky and covered with fire extinguisher stuff, I don\u0027t think keeping my clothes free of burned hair is a big deal.\" Eric didn\u0027t snort, but he came close. However, he did seem to pick up on my feeling that he was being a total pain, and he shut up and got a hold on himself. The relief was tremendous. Immanuel, whose hands were surprisingly steady for someone cooped up in a kitchen with two vampires (one remarkably irritable) and a charred barmaid, combed until my hair was as smooth as it could be. Then he picked up his scissors. I could feel the hairdresser focusing completely on his task. Immanuel was a champion at concentration, I discovered, since his mind lay open to me. It really didn\u0027t take long. The burned bits drifted to the floor like sad snowflakes. \"You need to go shower now and come back with clean, wet hair,\" Immanuel said. \"After that, I\u0027ll even it up. Where\u0027s your broom, your dustpan?\" I told him where to find them, and then I went into my bedroom, passing through it to my own bathroom. I wondered if Eric would join me, since I knew from past experience that he liked my shower. The way I felt, it would be far better if he stayed in the kitchen. I pulled off my smelly clothes and ran the water as hot as I could stand it. It was a relief to step into the tub and let the heat and wetness flow over me. When the warm water hit my legs, it stung. For a few moments I wasn\u0027t appreciative or happy about anything. I just remembered how scared I\u0027d been. But after I\u0027d dealt with that, I had something on my mind. The figure I\u0027d spotted running toward the bar, bottle in hand--I couldn\u0027t be completely sure, but I suspected it had not been human.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dead-reckoning-sookie-stackhouse-11/page-1.html","bookId":2201,"book":{"id":2201,"title":"Dead Reckoning (Sookie Stackhouse #11)","description":"Storyline: Dead Reckoning (Sookie Stackhouse #11) With her knack for being in trouble\u0027s way, Sookie witnesses the firebombing of Merlotte\u0027s, the bar where she works.
