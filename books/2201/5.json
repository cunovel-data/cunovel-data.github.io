{"id":101507,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"In the end, I didn\u0027t get to open the envelope until the next day.\n Brenda and Donald finished going over all the attic contents an hour after he\u0027d opened the hidden drawer. Then we sat down to discuss what they wanted from my miscellaneous clutter and how much they\u0027d pay me for it. At first, I was minded to simply say, \"Okay,\" but in the name of my family I felt obliged to try to get as much money as possible. To my impatience, the discussion went on for what seemed like forever.\n What it boiled down to: They wanted four large pieces of furniture (including the desk), a couple of dress forms, a small chest, some spoons, and two horn snuffboxes. Some of the underwear was in good shape, and Brenda said she knew a method of washing that would remove stains and make the garments look almost new, though she wouldn\u0027t give me much for them. A nursing chair (too low and small for modern women) was added to the list, and Donald wanted a box of costume jewelry from the thirties and forties. My great-grandmother\u0027s quilt, made in the wagon wheel pattern, was obviously worth a lot to the dealers, and that had never been my favorite pattern so I was glad to let it go.\n I was actually pleased that these items would be going to homes where they\u0027d be enjoyed and cared for and cherished instead of being stowed in an attic.\n I could tell that Donald really wanted to go through the big box of pictures and papers still awaiting my attention, but there was no way that was going to happen until I\u0027d looked at all of them. I told him so in very polite terms, and we also shook on the agreement that if any more secret compartments of any kind were found in the furniture I was selling them, I would have first right to buy the contents back if the contents had any money value.\n After they\u0027d called their store to arrange pickup and written a check, the dealers departed with one or two of their smaller purchases. They seemed as satisfied as I was with the day\u0027s work.\n Within an hour, a big Splendide truck came up the driveway with two husky young men in the cab. Forty-five minutes after that, the furniture was padded and loaded into the back. After it was gone, it was time for me to get ready for work. I regretfully postponed examining the items in my night table drawer.\n Though I had to hustle, I took a moment to enjoy having my house to myself as I put on my makeup and my uniform. It was warm enough to break out my shorts, I decided.\n I\u0027d gone to Wal-Mart and bought two new pair the week before. In honor of their debut, I\u0027d made sure my legs were shaved extra smooth. My tan was already well established. I looked in the mirror, pleased with the look.\n I got to Merlotte\u0027s about five. The first person I saw was the new waitress, India. India had smooth chocolate skin and cornrows and a stud in her nose, and she was the most cheerful human being I\u0027d encountered in a month of Sundays. Today she gave me a smile as if I were exactly the person she\u0027d been waiting to see . . . which was literally true. I was replacing India.\n \"You look out for trouble with that goober on five,\" she said. \"He\u0027s tossing \u0027em back. He must\u0027ve had a fight with his wife.\"\n I would know if he had or not after a moment\u0027s \"listening in.\" \"Thanks, India. Anything else?\"\n \"That couple on eleven, they want their tea unsweet with lots of lemon on the side. Their food should be up soon, the fried pickles and a burger each. Cheese on his.\"\n \"Okeydokey. Have a good evening.\"\n \"I\u0027m planning on it. I got a date.\"\n \"Who with?\" I asked, out of sheer idle curiosity.\n \"Lola Rushton,\" she said.\n \"I think I went to high school with Lola,\" I said, with only a short beat to indicate that India\u0027s dating women was any more than a daily occurrence.\n \"She remembers you,\" India said, and laughed.\n I was sure that was so, since I\u0027d been the weirdest person in my little high school class. \"Everyone remembers me as Crazy Sookie,\" I said, trying to keep the rue from my voice.\n \"She had a crush on you for a while,\" India told me.\n I felt oddly pleased. \"I\u0027m flattered to hear it,\" I said, and hustled off to start working.\n I made a quick round of my tables to be sure everyone was okay, served the fried pickles and burgers, and watched in relief as Mr. Grumpy and Dumped downed his last drink and left the bar. He wasn\u0027t drunk, but he was spoiling for a fight, and it was good to see the last of him. We didn\u0027t need more trouble.\n He wasn\u0027t the only grumpy guy in Merlotte\u0027s. Sam was filling out insurance forms that night, and because he hates filling out forms but has to do it all the time, his mood was not sunny. The paperwork was stacked on the bar, and in a lull between customers, I looked it over. If I read it carefully and slowly, it wasn\u0027t hard to figure out, no matter how convoluted the English got. I began checking boxes and filling in blanks, and I called the police station and told them we needed a copy of the police report on the firebombing. I gave them Sam\u0027s fax number, and Kevin promised he\u0027d get it to me.\n I looked up to find my boss standing there with an expression of total surprise on his face.\n \"I\u0027m sorry!\" I said instantly. \"You seemed to be so stressed out about it, and I didn\u0027t mind taking a look. I\u0027ll hand \u0027em back over.\" I grabbed up the papers and thrust them at Sam.\n \"No,\" he said, backing away with his hands held up. \"No, no. Sook, thanks. I never thought of asking for help.\" He glanced down. \"You called the police station?\"\n \"Yeah, I got Kevin Pryor. He\u0027s gonna send over the report to attach.\"\n \"Thanks, Sook.\" Sam looked like Santa Claus had just appeared in the bar.\n \"I don\u0027t mind forms,\" I said, smiling. \"They don\u0027t talk back. You better look it over to make sure I did it right.\"\n Sam beamed at me without sparing a downward glance. \"Good job, friend.\"\n \"No problem.\" It had been nice to have something to keep me busy, so I wouldn\u0027t think about the unexamined items in my night table drawer. I heard the front door open and looked around, relieved there was more business walking in the door. I had to work to hold the anticipation on my face when I saw that Jannalynn Hopper had arrived.\n Sam is what you might call adventuresome in his dating, and Jannalynn was not the first strong (not to say scary) female he\u0027d consorted with. Skinny and short, Jannalynn had an aggressive sense of fashion and a ferocious delight in her elevation to the job of pack enforcer for the Long Tooth pack, which was based in Shreveport.\n Tonight Jannalynn was wearing abbreviated denim shorts, those sandals that lace up the calves, and a single blue tank top with no bra underneath. She was wearing the earrings Sam had bought her at Splendide, and about six silver chains of assorted lengths and pendants gleamed around her neck. Her short hair was platinum now, spiky and bright. She was like a suncatcher, I thought, remembering the brightly colored one Jason had given me to hang in the kitchen window.\n \"Hello, honey,\" she said to Sam as she bypassed me without a sideways glance. She took Sam in a ferocious embrace and kissed him for all she was worth.\n He kissed her back, though I could tell from his brain signals that he was a little embarrassed. No such consideration bothered Jannalynn, of course. I hastily turned away to check the levels of salt and pepper in the shakers on the tables, though I knew quite well everything was fine.\n In truth, I\u0027d always found Jannalynn disturbing, almost frightening. She was very aware that Sam and I were friends, especially since I\u0027d met Sam\u0027s family at his brother\u0027s wedding, and they were under the impression that I was Sam\u0027s girlfriend. I really didn\u0027t blame her for her suspicions; if I\u0027d been her, I\u0027d have felt the same way.\n Jannalynn was a suspicious young woman by both nature and profession. Part of her job was to assess threats and act on them before harm could come to Alcide and the pack. She also managed Hair of the Dog, a little bar that catered especially to the Long Tooth pack and other twoeys in the Shreveport area. It was a lot of responsibility for someone as young as Jannalynn, but she seemed born to meet the challenge.\n By the time I\u0027d exhausted all the busywork I could think of, Jannalynn and Sam were having a quiet conversation. She was perched on a barstool, her muscular legs crossed elegantly, and he was in his usual position behind the bar. Her face was intent, and so was his; whatever their topic was, it was a serious one. I kept my mind slammed shut.\n The customers were doing their best not to gape at the young Were. The other waitress, Danielle, was glancing over at her from time to time while whispering with her boyfriend, who\u0027d come in to nurse a drink all evening so he could watch Danielle as she moved from table to table.\n Whatever Jannalynn\u0027s faults, you couldn\u0027t deny that she had real presence. When she was in a room, she had to be acknowledged. (I thought that was at least partially because she gave off such strong vibes that she was scary as hell.)\n A couple came in and glanced around before heading to an empty table in my section. They looked a little familiar. After a moment, I recognized them: Jack and Lily Leeds, private detectives from somewhere in Arkansas. The last time I\u0027d seen them, they\u0027d come to Bon Temps to investigate Debbie Pelt\u0027s disappearance, having been hired by her parents. I\u0027d answered their questions in what I now knew was sort of fairy-style--I\u0027d stuck to the letter of the truth without its spirit. I myself had shot Debbie Pelt dead in self-defense, and I hadn\u0027t wanted to go to jail for it.\n That had been over a year ago. Lily Bard Leeds was still pale, silent, and intense, and her husband was still attractive and vital. Her eyes had found me instantly, and it was impossible to pretend I hadn\u0027t noticed. Reluctantly, I went over to their table, feeling my smile growing more brittle with every step.\n \"Welcome back to Merlotte\u0027s,\" I said, grinning for all I was worth. \"What can I get you two this evening? We put French-fried pickles on the menu, and our burgers Lafayette are real good.\"\n Lily looked as if I\u0027d suggested she eat breaded worms, though Jack looked a bit regretful. He wouldn\u0027t have minded the pickles, I could tell.\n \"A hamburger Lafayette for me, I guess,\" Lily said unenthusiastically. As she turned to her companion, her T-shirt shifted and I caught a glimpse of a set of old scars that rivaled my own new ones.\n Well, we had always had things in common.\n \"The hamburger for me, too,\" Jack said. \"And if you have a moment to spare, we\u0027d like to talk to you.\" He smiled at me, and the long, thin scar on his face flexed as his eyebrows rose. Was this personal-mutilation evening? I wondered if his light jacket, unnecessary on so warm a day, covered something even worse.\n \"We can have a talk. I figured you didn\u0027t come back to Merlotte\u0027s because of the great cuisine,\" I said, and took their drink order before I went over to the window to hand the slip to Antoine.\n With their iced teas and a dish of lemon, I returned to the table. I looked around to make sure no one needed me before I sat down opposite Jack with Lily to my left. She was pretty to look at, but so controlled and muscular I felt like I could bounce a dime off her. Even her mind was sort of tidy and strict.\n \"What shall we talk about?\" I asked, and opened up my mind to them. Jack was thinking about Lily, some concern about her health, no, her mother\u0027s health--a recurrence of breast cancer. Lily was thinking about me, puzzling over me, suspecting I was a killer.\n That hurt.\n But it was true.\n \"Sandra Pelt is out of jail,\" Jack Leeds said, and though I heard the words in his brain before he spoke them, I didn\u0027t have to fake a shocked face.\n \"She was in jail? So that\u0027s why I haven\u0027t seen her since her folks died.\" The older Pelts had promised to keep Sandra in check. After I\u0027d heard about their deaths, I\u0027d wondered when she\u0027d show up. When I hadn\u0027t seen her right away, I\u0027d relaxed. \"You\u0027re telling me this because?\" I managed to say.\n \"Because she hates your guts,\" Lily said calmly. \"And you were never found guilty by any court of the disappearance of her sister. You weren\u0027t even arrested. I don\u0027t think you ever will be. You might even be innocent, though I don\u0027t think so. Sandra Pelt is simply crazy. And she\u0027s obsessed with you. I think you need to be careful. Real careful.\"\n \"Why was she in jail?\"\n \"Assault and battery on one of her cousins. This cousin had gotten a cut of the money in Sandra\u0027s parents\u0027 will, and apparently Sandra took issue with that.\"\n I was very, very worried. Sandra Pelt was a vicious and amoral young woman. I was sure she hadn\u0027t hit twenty yet, and she\u0027d made a determined attempt to kill me more than once. There was no one now to call her to heel, and her mental status was therefore even more suspect, according to the private detectives.\n \"But why did you make a trip down here to tell me?\" I said. \"I mean, I do appreciate it, but you weren\u0027t obliged . . . and you could have picked up the phone. Private eyes work for money, last I heard. Is someone paying you to warn me?\"\n \"The Pelt estate,\" Lily said, after a pause. \"Their lawyer, who lives in New Orleans, is the court-appointed guardian for Sandra until she reaches twenty-one.\"\n \"His name?\"\n She pulled a piece of paper out of her pocket. \"It\u0027s a sort of Baltic name,\" she said. \"And I may not pronounce it correctly.\"\n \"Cataliades,\" I said, putting the emphasis on the second syllable where it belonged.\n \"Yes,\" said Jack, surprised. \"That\u0027s him. Big guy.\"\n I nodded. Mr. Cataliades and I were friendly. He was mostly a demon, but the Leedses didn\u0027t seem to know that. In fact, they didn\u0027t seem to know much of anything about the other world, the one that lay beneath the human one. \"So Mr. Cataliades sent you two down here to warn me? He\u0027s the executor?\" \"Yeah. He was going to be away from his desk for some time, and he wanted to be sure you knew the girl was on the loose. He seemed to feel some obligation to you.\"\n I pondered that. I only knew of one time I\u0027d done the lawyer a good turn. I had helped him get out of the collapsing hotel in Rhodes. Nice to know that at least one person was serious when he said, \"I owe you.\" It seemed pretty ironic that the Pelt estate was paying the Leedses to come warn me against the last living Pelt; not ironic as in \"ha!\" but ironic as in bitter.\n \"If you don\u0027t mind me asking, how come he contacted you two? I mean, I\u0027m sure there are lots of private eyes in New Orleans, for example. You all are still based in the Little Rock area, right?\"\n Lily shrugged. \"He called us; he asked if we were free; he sent the check. His instructions were very specific. Both of us, to the bar, today. In fact . . .\" She glanced down at her watch. \"To the minute.\"\n They looked at me expectantly, waiting for me to explain this oddity on the part of the lawyer.\n I was thinking furiously. If Mr. Cataliades had sent two tough people to the bar, instructing them to arrive at a given time, it must be because he knew they were going to be needed. For some reason, their presence was necessary and desirable. When would you need capable hardbodies?\n When trouble was on its way.\n Before I knew I was going to do it, I stood and turned toward the entrance. Naturally, the Leedses looked where I was looking, so we were all watching the door when trouble opened it.\n Four tough guys came in. My grandmother would have said they were loaded for bear. They might as well have stenciled \"Badass and Proud of It\" on their foreheads. They were definitely high on something, full of themselves, brimming with aggression. And armed.\n After a second\u0027s peek in their heads, I knew they\u0027d taken vampire blood. That was the most unpredictable drug on the market--also the most expensive, because harvesting it was so dangerous. People who drank vampire blood were--for a length of time impossible to predict--incredibly strong and incredibly reckless . . . and sometimes batshit crazy.\n Though her back was to the newcomers, Jannalynn seemed to smell them. She swung around on her stool and focused, just like someone had drawn a bow and aimed the arrow. I could feel the animal wafting off her. Something wild and savage filled the air, and I realized the smell was coming from Sam, too. Jack and Lily Leeds were on their feet. Jack had his hand under his jacket, and I knew he had a gun. Lily\u0027s hands were poised in a strange way, as if she were about to gesture and had frozen in midmove.\n \"Hidee-ho, jerkoffs!\" said the tallest one, addressing the bar in general. He had a heavy beard and thick dark hair, but underneath it I saw how young he was. I thought he couldn\u0027t be more than nineteen. \"We come to have some fun with you lizards.\"\n \"No lizards here,\" Sam said, his voice even and calm. \"You fellas are welcome to have a drink, but after that I think you better leave. This is a quiet place, a local place, and we don\u0027t need trouble.\"\n \"Trouble\u0027s already here!\" boasted the shortest asshole. His face was clean-shaven, and his hair was only blond stubble, showing scars on his scalp. He was built broad and chunky. The third kid was thin and dark, maybe Hispanic. His black hair was slicked back, and his lips had a sensuous pout to them that he tried to counteract by sneering. The fourth guy had gotten off on the vampire blood even more seriously than the rest, and he couldn\u0027t speak because he was lost in his own world. His eyes jerked from side to side as if he were tracking things the rest of us couldn\u0027t see. He was big, too. I thought the first attack would come from him, and though I was the least of the combatants, I began to ease to my right, planning to come at him from the side.\n \"We can have peace here,\" Sam said. He was still trying, though I knew he understood that there was no way we were going to escape violence. He was buying time for everyone in Merlotte\u0027s to understand what was up.\n That was a good idea. By the time a few more seconds had passed, even the slowest of the few patrons had moved as far from the action as they could get, except for Danny Prideaux, who\u0027d been playing darts with Andy Bellefleur, and Andy himself. Danny was actually holding a dart. Andy was off duty, but he was armed. I watched Jack Leeds\u0027s eyes and saw he\u0027d realized, as I had, where the worst trouble would come from. The dazed hoodlum was actually rocking back and forth on his heels.\n Since Jack Leeds had a gun and I did not, I carefully inched backward so I wouldn\u0027t interfere with his shot. Lily\u0027s cold eyes followed my small movement, and she nodded almost undetectably. I\u0027d done a sensible thing.\n \"We don\u0027t want peace,\" snarled Bearded Leader. \"We want the blonde.\" And he pointed in my direction with his left hand, while his right hand pulled a knife. It looked like it was two feet long, though maybe my fear was acting like a magnifying glass.\n \"We gonna take care of her,\" Blond Bristles said.\n \"And then maybe the resta you,\" Pouty Lips added.\n Crazy Guy just smiled.\n \"I don\u0027t think so,\" Jack Leeds said. Jack pulled his gun in one smooth movement. Possibly he would have done it anyway out of sheer self- defense, but it didn\u0027t hurt that his wife, standing right by me, was a blonde. He couldn\u0027t be completely sure they meant me, the other white meat.\n \"I don\u0027t think so, either,\" said Andy Bellefleur. His arm was rock steady as he aimed his own Sig Sauer at the man with the knife. \"You drop that pigsticker, and we\u0027ll work something out.\"\n They might be high as kites, but at least three of the thugs retained enough sense to realize that facing guns was a bad idea. There was a lot of uncertain twitching and eye shifting as they flickered gazes at each other. The moment hung in the balance.\n Unfortunately, Crazy Guy went over the edge and charged for Sam, so now we were all committed to stupidity. With Were swiftness, Pouty Lips whipped out his own gun, aimed, and fired. I\u0027m not sure who he intended to hit, but he winged Jack Leeds, whose return shot went wild as he fell.\n Watching Lily Leeds was a lesson in motion. She took two quick steps, pivoted on her left foot, and her right foot floated through the air to kick Pouty Lips in the head with the force of a mule. Almost before he hit the floor she was on him, pitching his gun toward the bar and breaking his arm in a flow of motion that was nearly hypnotic. As he screamed, Bearded Asshole and Blond Bristles gaped at her.\n That second of inattention was all it took. Jannalynn took a flying leap off her barstool, describing an amazing arc through the air. She landed on Crazy Guy as Sam tackled him, and though CG howled and snapped and tried to throw her off, Jannalynn reared back to punch him in the jaw. I distinctly heard the bone break, and then Jannalynn leaped to her feet and stomped on his femur. Another snap. Sam, still holding him down, yelled, \"Stop!\"\n In those seconds, Andy Bellefleur rushed Bearded Asshole, who\u0027d whirled to present his back to Andy when Lily attacked Pouty Lips. When the tall guy felt the gun in his back, he froze.\n \"Drop the knife,\" Andy said. He was in deadly earnest.\n Blond Bristles cocked his arm back to strike a blow. Danny Prideaux threw his dart. It got Blond Bristles square in the meat of his arm, and he shrieked like a teakettle. Sam abandoned Crazy Guy to punch Blond Bristles right in his brisket. The guy went down like a sawn tree.\n Bearded Asshole looked at his buddies, down and disabled, and then he dropped the knife. Sensible.\n Finally. In less than two minutes, it was all over.\n I\u0027d whipped my clean white apron off, and I bound Jack Leeds\u0027s wound while Lily held his arm out for me, her face white as a vampire\u0027s. She wanted to kill Pouty Lips in the worst possible way, because she loved her husband with an overwhelming passion. The strength of her feelings almost swamped me. Lily might be icy on the outside, but inside she was Vesuvius.\n As soon as Jack\u0027s bleeding slowed, she turned to Pouty Lips, her face still absolutely calm. \"You even move, I\u0027ll break your fucking neck,\" she said, her voice uninflected. The young thug probably didn\u0027t even hear her through his own groaning and moaning, but her tone came through and he tried to inch away from her.\n Andy had already talked to the 911 dispatcher. In a moment I heard the siren, a disturbingly familiar sound. We might as well retain an ambulance to stay in the parking lot at this rate.\n Crazy Guy was screaming weakly at the pain in his leg and jaw. Sam had saved his life: Jannalynn was actually panting, she was so close to changing after the excitement and stimulation of the violence. The bones had slid around underneath the skin of her face, which was looking long and lumpy.\n It wouldn\u0027t be good if she became a wolf before law enforcement got here. I didn\u0027t try to spell out why to myself. I said, \"Hey, Jannalynn.\" Her eyes met mine. Hers were changing shape and color. Her little figure began to twist and turn restlessly.\n \"You have to stop,\" I said. All around us there was yelling, and excitement, and the thick atmosphere of fear--not a good atmosphere for a young werewolf. \"You can\u0027t change now.\" I kept my eyes fixed on hers. I didn\u0027t speak again but made sure she kept looking at me. \"Breathe with me,\" I said, and she made the effort. Gradually her own breathing slowed, and even more gradually her face resumed its normal contours. Her body ceased its restless movement, and her eyes returned to their regular brown.\n \"All right,\" she said.\n Sam put his hands on her thin shoulders. He gave her a tight hug. \"Thanks, honey,\" he said. \"Thanks. You\u0027re the greatest.\" I felt the faintest thrum of exasperation.\n \"Left your ass in the dust,\" she said, and laughed raggedly. \"Was that a good jump, or what? Wait\u0027ll I tell Alcide.\"\n \"You\u0027re the quickest,\" Sam said, his voice gentle. \"You\u0027re the best pack enforcer I ever met.\" You would have thought he\u0027d told her she was as sexy as Heidi Klum, she was so proud.\n And then the law enforcement people and the emergency people were there, and we had to go through the whole procedure again.\n Lily and Jack Leeds took off to the hospital. She told the ambulance personnel she could take him herself in their car, and I understood from her thoughts that their insurance wouldn\u0027t cover the whole cost of the ambulance ride. Considering the emergency room was only a few blocks away and Jack was walking and talking, I could see her reasoning. They never did get their food, and I didn\u0027t get to thank them for the warning and for their promptness in obeying Mr. Cataliades\u0027s orders. I wondered more than ever how he\u0027d managed to shunt them into the bar in such a timely manner.\n Andy was pardonably proud of his part in the incident, and he got some pats on the back from his fellow officers. They all regarded Jannalynn with barely concealed mistrust and respect. All the bar patrons who\u0027d tried to stay out of the way were falling all over themselves to describe Lily Leeds\u0027s great kick and Jannalynn\u0027s show-stopping leap onto Crazy Guy.\n Somehow, the picture the police got was that these four strangers had announced their intention to take Lily hostage and then to rob Merlotte\u0027s. I\u0027m not sure how that impression gathered credibility, but I was glad it did. If the bar patrons assumed that the blonde in question had been Lily Leeds, that was fine with me. She was certainly an outstanding-looking woman, and the strangers might have been following her, or they might have decided to rob the bar and take Lily as a bonus.\n Due to this welcome misconception, I escaped from any more questioning than the other patrons got.\n In the grand scheme of things, I thought it was about time I got a break. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dead-reckoning-sookie-stackhouse-11/page-5.html","bookId":2201,"book":{"id":2201,"title":"Dead Reckoning (Sookie Stackhouse #11)","description":"Storyline: \n Dead Reckoning (Sookie Stackhouse #11) \n With her knack for being in trouble\u0027s way, Sookie witnesses the firebombing of Merlotte\u0027s, the bar where she works.
