{"id":7416,"no":37,"title":"Part 3 Chapter 9","content":"ARRIVED at her house, Lizabetha Prokofievna paused in the first room. She could go no farther, and subsided on to a couch quite exhausted; too feeble to remember so much as to ask the prince to take a seat. This was a large reception-room, full of flowers, and with a glass door leading into the garden.\n Alexandra and Adelaida came in almost immediately, and looked inquiringly at the prince and their mother.\n The girls generally rose at about nine in the morning in the country; Aglaya, of late, had been in the habit of getting up rather earlier and having a walk in the garden, but not at seven o\u0027clock; about eight or a little later was her usual time.\n Lizabetha Prokofievna, who really had not slept all night, rose at about eight on purpose to meet Aglaya in the garden and walk with her; but she could not find her either in the garden or in her own room.\n This agitated the old lady considerably; and she awoke her other daughters. Next, she learned from the maid that Aglaya had gone into the park before seven o\u0027clock. The sisters made a joke of Aglaya\u0027s last freak, and told their mother that if she went into the park to look for her, Aglaya would probably be very angry with her, and that she was pretty sure to be sitting reading on the green bench that she had talked of two or three days since, and about which she had nearly quarrelled with Prince S., who did not see anything particularly lovely in it.\n Arrived at the rendezvous of the prince and her daughter, and hearing the strange words of the latter, Lizabetha Prokofievna had been dreadfully alarmed, for many reasons. However, now that she had dragged the prince home with her, she began to feel a little frightened at what she had undertaken. Why should not Aglaya meet the prince in the park and have a talk with him, even if such a meeting should be by appointment?\n \"Don\u0027t suppose, prince,\" she began, bracing herself up for the effort, \"don\u0027t suppose that I have brought you here to ask questions. After last night, I assure you, I am not so exceedingly anxious to see you at all; I could have postponed the pleasure for a long while.\" She paused.\n \"But at the same time you would be very glad to know how I happened to meet Aglaya Ivanovna this morning?\" The prince finished her speech for her with the utmost composure.\n \"Well, what then? Supposing I should like to know?\" cried Lizabetha Prokofievna, blushing. \"I\u0027m sure I am not afraid of plain speaking. I\u0027m not offending anyone, and I never wish to, and--\"\n \"Pardon me, it is no offence to wish to know this; you are her mother. We met at the green bench this morning, punctually at seven o\u0027clock,--according to an agreement made by Aglaya Ivanovna with myself yesterday. She said that she wished to see me and speak to me about something important. We met and conversed for an hour about matters concerning Aglaya Ivanovna herself, and that\u0027s all.\"\n \"Of course it is all, my friend. I don\u0027t doubt you for a moment,\" said Lizabetha Prokofievna with dignity.\n \"Well done, prince, capital!\" cried Aglaya, who entered the room at this moment. \"Thank you for assuming that I would not demean myself with lies. Come, is that enough, mamma, or do you intend to put any more questions?\"\n \"You know I have never needed to blush before you, up to this day, though perhaps you would have been glad enough to make me,\" said Lizabetha Prokofievna,--with majesty. \"Good-bye, prince; forgive me for bothering you. I trust you will rest assured of my unalterable esteem for you.\"\n The prince made his bows and retired at once. Alexandra and Adelaida smiled and whispered to each other, while Lizabetha Prokofievna glared severely at them. \"We are only laughing at the prince\u0027s beautiful bows, mamma,\" said Adelaida. \"Sometimes he bows just like a meal-sack, but to-day he was like--like Evgenie Pavlovitch!\"\n \"It is the HEART which is the best teacher of refinement and dignity, not the dancing-master,\" said her mother, sententiously, and departed upstairs to her own room, not so much as glancing at Aglaya.\n When the prince reached home, about nine o\u0027clock, he found Vera Lebedeff and the maid on the verandah. They were both busy trying to tidy up the place after last night\u0027s disorderly party.\n \"Thank goodness, we\u0027ve just managed to finish it before you came in!\" said Vera, joyfully.\n \"Good-morning! My head whirls so; I didn\u0027t sleep all night. I should like to have a nap now.\"\n \"Here, on the verandah? Very well, I\u0027ll tell them all not to come and wake you. Papa has gone out somewhere.\"\n The servant left the room. Vera was about to follow her, but returned and approached the prince with a preoccupied air.\n \"Prince!\" she said, \"have pity on that poor boy; don\u0027t turn him out today.\"\n \"Not for the world; he shall do just as he likes.\"\n \"He won\u0027t do any harm now; and--and don\u0027t be too severe with him,\"\n \"Oh dear no! Why--\"\n \"And--and you won\u0027t LAUGH at him? That\u0027s the chief thing.\"\n \"Oh no! Never.\"\n \"How foolish I am to speak of such things to a man like you,\" said Vera, blushing. \"Though you DO look tired,\" she added, half turning away,\" your eyes are so splendid at this moment--so full of happiness.\"\n \"Really?\" asked the prince, gleefully, and he laughed in delight.\n But Vera, simple-minded little girl that she was (just like a boy, in fact), here became dreadfully confused, of a sudden, and ran hastily out of the room, laughing and blushing.\n \"What a dear little thing she is,\" thought the prince, and immediately forgot all about her.\n He walked to the far end of the verandah, where the sofa stood, with a table in front of it. Here he sat down and covered his face with his hands, and so remained for ten minutes. Suddenly he put his hand in his coat-pocket and hurriedly produced three letters.\n But the door opened again, and out came Colia.\n The prince actually felt glad that he had been interrupted,--and might return the letters to his pocket. He was glad of the respite.\n \"Well,\" said Colia, plunging in medias res, as he always did, \"here\u0027s a go! What do you think of Hippolyte now? Don\u0027t respect him any longer, eh?\"\n \"Why not? But look here, Colia, I\u0027m tired; besides, the subject is too melancholy to begin upon again. How is he, though?\"\n \"Asleep--he\u0027ll sleep for a couple of hours yet. I quite understand--you haven\u0027t slept--you walked about the park, I know. Agitation--excitement--all that sort of thing--quite natural, too!\"\n \"How do you know I walked in the park and didn\u0027t sleep at home?\"\n \"Vera just told me. She tried to persuade me not to come, but I couldn\u0027t help myself, just for one minute. I have been having my turn at the bedside for the last two hours; Kostia Lebedeff is there now. Burdovsky has gone. Now, lie down, prince, make yourself comfortable, and sleep well! I\u0027m awfully impressed, you know.\"\n \"Naturally, all this--\"\n \"No, no, I mean with the \u0027explanation,\u0027 especially that part of it where he talks about Providence and a future life. There is a gigantic thought there.\"\n The prince gazed affectionately at Colia, who, of course, had come in solely for the purpose of talking about this \"gigantic thought.\"\n \"But it is not any one particular thought, only; it is the general circumstances of the case. If Voltaire had written this now, or Rousseau, I should have just read it and thought it remarkable, but should not have been so IMPRESSED by it. But a man who knows for certain that he has but ten minutes to live and can talk like that--why--it\u0027s--it\u0027s PRIDE, that is! It is really a most extraordinary, exalted assertion of personal dignity, it\u0027s--it\u0027s DEFIANT! What a GIGANTIC strength of will, eh? And to accuse a fellow like that of not putting in the cap on purpose; it\u0027s base and mean! You know he deceived us last night, the cunning rascal. I never packed his bag for him, and I never saw his pistol. He packed it himself. But he put me off my guard like that, you see. Vera says you are going to let him stay on; I swear there\u0027s no danger, especially as we are always with him.\"\n \"Who was by him at night?\"\n \"I, and Burdovsky, and Kostia Lebedeff. Keller stayed a little while, and then went over to Lebedeff\u0027s to sleep. Ferdishenko slept at Lebedeff\u0027s, too; but he went away at seven o\u0027clock. My father is always at Lebedeff\u0027s; but he has gone out just now. I dare say Lebedeff will be coming in here directly; he has been looking for you; I don\u0027t know what he wants. Shall we let him in or not, if you are asleep? I\u0027m going to have a nap, too. By-the- by, such a curious thing happened. Burdovsky woke me at seven, and I met my father just outside the room, so drunk, he didn\u0027t even know me. He stood before me like a log, and when he recovered himself, asked hurriedly how Hippolyte was. \u0027Yes,\u0027 he said, when I told him, \u0027that\u0027s all very well, but I REALLY came to warn you that you must be very careful what you say before Ferdishenko.\u0027 Do you follow me, prince?\"\n \"Yes. Is it really so? However, it\u0027s all the same to us, of course.\"\n \"Of course it is; we are not a secret society; and that being the case, it is all the more curious that the general should have been on his way to wake me up in order to tell me this.\"\n \"Ferdishenko has gone, you say?\"\n \"Yes, he went at seven o\u0027clock. He came into the room on his way out; I was watching just then. He said he was going to spend \u0027the rest of the night\u0027 at Wilkin\u0027s; there\u0027s a tipsy fellow, a friend of his, of that name. Well, I\u0027m off. Oh, here\u0027s Lebedeff himself! The prince wants to go to sleep, Lukian Timofeyovitch, so you may just go away again.\"\n \"One moment, my dear prince, just one. I must absolutely speak to you about something which is most grave,\" said Lebedeff, mysteriously and solemnly, entering the room with a bow and looking extremely important. He had but just returned, and carried his hat in his hand. He looked preoccupied and most unusually dignified.\n The prince begged him to take a chair.\n \"I hear you have called twice; I suppose you are still worried about yesterday\u0027s affair.\"\n \"What, about that boy, you mean? Oh dear no, yesterday my ideas were a little--well--mixed. Today, I assure you, I shall not oppose in the slightest degree any suggestions it may please you to make.\"\n \"What\u0027s up with you this morning, Lebedeff? You look so important and dignified, and you choose your words so carefully,\" said the prince, smiling.\n \"Nicolai Ardalionovitch!\" said Lebedeff, in a most amiable tone of voice, addressing the boy. \"As I have a communication to make to the prince which concerns only myself--\"\n \"Of course, of course, not my affair. All right,\" said Colia, and away he went.\n \"I love that boy for his perception,\" said Lebedeff, looking after him. \"My dear prince,\" he continued, \"I have had a terrible misfortune, either last night or early this morning. I cannot tell the exact time.\"\n \"What is it?\"\n \"I have lost four hundred roubles out of my side pocket! They\u0027re gone!\" said Lebedeff, with a sour smile.\n \"You\u0027ve lost four hundred roubles? Oh! I\u0027m sorry for that.\"\n \"Yes, it is serious for a poor man who lives by his toil.\"\n \"Of course, of course! How was it?\"\n \"Oh, the wine is to blame, of course. I confess to you, prince, as I would to Providence itself. Yesterday I received four hundred roubles from a debtor at about five in the afternoon, and came down here by train. I had my purse in my pocket. When I changed, I put the money into the pocket of my plain clothes, intending to keep it by me, as I expected to have an applicant for it in the evening.\"\n \"It\u0027s true then, Lebedeff, that you advertise to lend money on gold or silver articles?\"\n \"Yes, through an agent. My own name doesn\u0027t appear. I have a large family, you see, and at a small percentage--\"\n \"Quite so, quite so. I only asked for information--excuse the question. Go on.\"\n \"Well, meanwhile that sick boy was brought here, and those guests came in, and we had tea, and--well, we made merry--to my ruin! Hearing of your birthday afterwards, and excited with the circumstances of the evening, I ran upstairs and changed my plain clothes once more for my uniform [Civil Service clerks in Russia wear uniform.]--you must have noticed I had my uniform on all the evening? Well, I forgot the money in the pocket of my old coat-- you know when God will ruin a man he first of all bereaves him of his senses--and it was only this morning at half-past seven that I woke up and grabbed at my coat pocket, first thing. The pocket was empty--the purse gone, and not a trace to be found!\"\n \"Dear me! This is very unpleasant!\"\n \"Unpleasant! Indeed it is. You have found a very appropriate expression,\" said Lebedeff, politely, but with sarcasm.\n \"But what\u0027s to be done? It\u0027s a serious matter,\" said the prince, thoughtfully. \"Don\u0027t you think you may have dropped it out of your pocket whilst intoxicated?\"\n \"Certainly. Anything is possible when one is intoxicated, as you neatly express it, prince. But consider--if I, intoxicated or not, dropped an object out of my pocket on to the ground, that object ought to remain on the ground. Where is the object, then?\"\n \"Didn\u0027t you put it away in some drawer, perhaps?\"\n \"I\u0027ve looked everywhere, and turned out everything.\"\n \"I confess this disturbs me a good deal. Someone must have picked it up, then.\"\n \"Or taken it out of my pocket--two alternatives.\"\n \"It is very distressing, because WHO--? That\u0027s the question!\"\n \"Most undoubtedly, excellent prince, you have hit it--that is the very question. How wonderfully you express the exact situation in a few words!\"\n \"Come, come, Lebedeff, no sarcasm! It\u0027s a serious--\"\n \"Sarcasm!\" cried Lebedeff, wringing his hands. \"All right, all right, I\u0027m not angry. I\u0027m only put out about this. Whom do you suspect?\"\n \"That is a very difficult and complicated question. I cannot suspect the servant, for she was in the kitchen the whole evening, nor do I suspect any of my children.\"\n \"I should think not. Go on.\"\n \"Then it must be one of the guests.\"\n \"Is such a thing possible?\"\n \"Absolutely and utterly impossible--and yet, so it must be. But one thing I am sure of, if it be a theft, it was committed, not in the evening when we were all together, but either at night or early in the morning; therefore, by one of those who slept here. Burdovsky and Colia I except, of course. They did not even come into my room.\"\n \"Yes, or even if they had! But who did sleep with you?\" \"Four of us, including myself, in two rooms. The general, myself, Keller, and Ferdishenko. One of us four it must have been. I don\u0027t suspect myself, though such cases have been known.\"\n \"Oh! DO go on, Lebedeff! Don\u0027t drag it out so.\"\n \"Well, there are three left, then--Keller firstly. He is a drunkard to begin with, and a liberal (in the sense of other people\u0027s pockets), otherwise with more of the ancient knight about him than of the modern liberal. He was with the sick man at first, but came over afterwards because there was no place to lie down in the room and the floor was so hard.\"\n \"You suspect him?\"\n \"I DID suspect him. When I woke up at half-past seven and tore my hair in despair for my loss and carelessness, I awoke the general, who was sleeping the sleep of innocence near me. Taking into consideration the sudden disappearance of Ferdishenko, which was suspicious in itself, we decided to search Keller, who was lying there sleeping like a top. Well, we searched his clothes thoroughly, and not a farthing did we find; in fact, his pockets all had holes in them. We found a dirty handkerchief, and a love- letter from some scullery-maid. The general decided that he was innocent. We awoke him for further inquiries, and had the greatest difficulty in making him understand what was up. He opened his mouth and stared--he looked so stupid and so absurdly innocent. It wasn\u0027t Keller.\"\n \"Oh, I\u0027m so glad!\" said the prince, joyfully. \"I was so afraid.\"\n \"Afraid! Then you had some grounds for supposing he might be the culprit?\" said Lebedeff, frowning.\n \"Oh no--not a bit! It was foolish of me to say I was afraid! Don\u0027t repeat it please, Lebedeff, don\u0027t tell anyone I said that!\"\n \"My dear prince! your words lie in the lowest depth of my heart-- it is their tomb!\" said Lebedeff, solemnly, pressing his hat to the region of his heart.\n \"Thanks; very well. Then I suppose it\u0027s Ferdishenko; that is, I mean, you suspect Ferdishenko?\"\n \"Whom else?\" said Lebedeff, softly, gazing intently into the prince s face.\n \"Of course--quite so, whom else? But what are the proofs?\"\n \"We have evidence. In the first place, his mysterious disappearance at seven o\u0027clock, or even earlier.\"\n \"I know, Colia told me that he had said he was off to--I forget the name, some friend of his, to finish the night.\"\n \"H\u0027m! then Colia has spoken to you already?\"\n \"Not about the theft.\"\n \"He does not know of it; I have kept it a secret. Very well, Ferdishenko went off to Wilkin\u0027s. That is not so curious in itself, but here the evidence opens out further. He left his address, you see, when he went. Now prince, consider, why did he leave his address? Why do you suppose he went out of his way to tell Colia that he had gone to Wilkin\u0027s? Who cared to know that he was going to Wilkin\u0027s? No, no! prince, this is finesse, thieves\u0027 finesse! This is as good as saying, \u0027There, how can I be a thief when I leave my address? I\u0027m not concealing my movements as a thief would.\u0027 Do you understand, prince?\"\n \"Oh yes, but that is not enough.\"\n \"Second proof. The scent turns out to be false, and the address given is a sham. An hour after--that is at about eight, I went to Wilkin\u0027s myself, and there was no trace of Ferdishenko. The maid did tell me, certainly, that an hour or so since someone had been hammering at the door, and had smashed the bell; she said she would not open the door because she didn\u0027t want to wake her master; probably she was too lazy to get up herself. Such phenomena are met with occasionally!\"\n \"But is that all your evidence? It is not enough!\"\n \"Well, prince, whom are we to suspect, then? Consider!\" said Lebedeff with almost servile amiability, smiling at the prince. There was a look of cunning in his eyes, however.\n \"You should search your room and all the cupboards again,\" said the prince, after a moment or two of silent reflection.\n \"But I have done so, my dear prince!\" said Lebedeff, more sweetly than ever.\n \"H\u0027m! why must you needs go up and change your coat like that?\" asked the prince, banging the table with his fist, in annoyance.\n \"Oh, don\u0027t be so worried on my account, prince! I assure you I am not worth it! At least, not I alone. But I see you are suffering on behalf of the criminal too, for wretched Ferdishenko, in fact!\"\n \"Of course you have given me a disagreeable enough thing to think about,\" said the prince, irritably, \"but what are you going to do, since you are so sure it was Ferdishenko?\"\n \"But who else COULD it be, my very dear prince?\" repeated Lebedeff, as sweet as sugar again. \"If you don\u0027t wish me to suspect Mr. Burdovsky?\"\n \"Of course not.\"\n \"Nor the general? Ha, ha, ha!\"\n \"Nonsense!\" said the prince, angrily, turning round upon him.\n \"Well, hardly at all. I wish I were, if only for the sake of justifying myself in her eyes. Nina Alexandrovna has a grudge against me for, as she thinks, encouraging her husband in drinking; whereas in reality I not only do not encourage him, but I actually keep him out of harm\u0027s way, and out of bad company. Besides, he\u0027s my friend, prince, so that I shall not lose sight of him, again. Where he goes, I go. He\u0027s quite given up visiting the captain\u0027s widow, though sometimes he thinks sadly of her, especially in the morning, when he\u0027s putting on his boots. I don\u0027t know why it\u0027s at that time. But he has no money, and it\u0027s no use his going to see her without. Has he borrowed any money from you, prince?\"\n \"No, he has not.\"\n \"Ah, he\u0027s ashamed to! He MEANT to ask you, I know, for he said so. I suppose he thinks that as you gave him some once (you remember), you would probably refuse if he asked you again.\"\n \"Do you ever give him money?\"\n \"Prince! Money! Why I would give that man not only my money, but my very life, if he wanted it. Well, perhaps that\u0027s exaggeration; not life, we\u0027ll say, but some illness, a boil or a bad cough, or anything of that sort, I would stand with pleasure, for his sake; for I consider him a great man fallen--money, indeed!\"\n \"H\u0027m, then you DO give him money?\"\n \"N-no, I have never given him money, and he knows well that I will never give him any; because I am anxious to keep him out of intemperate ways. He is going to town with me now; for you must know I am off to Petersburg after Ferdishenko, while the scent is hot; I\u0027m certain he is there. I shall let the general go one way, while I go the other; we have so arranged matters in order to pop out upon Ferdishenko, you see, from different sides. But I am going to follow that naughty old general and catch him, I know where, at a certain widow\u0027s house; for I think it will be a good lesson, to put him to shame by catching him with the widow.\"\n \"Oh, Lebedeff, don\u0027t, don\u0027t make any scandal about it!\" said the prince, much agitated, and speaking in a low voice.\n \"Not for the world, not for the world! I merely wish to make him ashamed of himself. Oh, prince, great though this misfortune be to myself, I cannot help thinking of his morals! I have a great favour to ask of you, esteemed prince; I confess that it is the chief object of my visit. You know the Ivolgins, you have even lived in their house; so if you would lend me your help, honoured prince, in the general\u0027s own interest and for his good.\"\n Lebedeff clasped his hands in supplication.\n \"What help do you want from me? You may be certain that I am most anxious to understand you, Lebedeff.\"\n \"I felt sure of that, or I should not have come to you. We might manage it with the help of Nina Alexandrovna, so that he might be closely watched in his own house. Unfortunately I am not on terms ... otherwise ... but Nicolai Ardalionovitch, who adores you with all his youthful soul, might help, too.\"\n \"No, no! Heaven forbid that we should bring Nina Alexandrovna into this business! Or Colia, either. But perhaps I have not yet quite understood you, Lebedeff?\"\n Lebedeff made an impatient movement.\n \"But there is nothing to understand! Sympathy and tenderness, that is all--that is all our poor invalid requires! You will permit me to consider him an invalid?\"\n \"Yes, it shows delicacy and intelligence on your part.\"\n \"I will explain my idea by a practical example, to make it clearer. You know the sort of man he is. At present his only failing is that he is crazy about that captain\u0027s widow, and he cannot go to her without money, and I mean to catch him at her house today--for his own good; but supposing it was not only the widow, but that he had committed a real crime, or at least some very dishonourable action (of which he is, of course, incapable), I repeat that even in that case, if he were treated with what I may call generous tenderness, one could get at the whole truth, for he is very soft-hearted! Believe me, he would betray himself before five days were out; he would burst into tears, and make a clean breast of the matter; especially if managed with tact, and if you and his family watched his every step, so to speak. Oh, my dear prince,\" Lebedeff added most emphatically, \"I do not positively assert that he has ... I am ready, as the saying is, to shed my last drop of blood for him this instant; but you will admit that debauchery, drunkenness, and the captain\u0027s widow, all these together may lead him very far.\"\n \"I am, of course, quite ready to add my efforts to yours in such a case,\" said the prince, rising; \"but I confess, Lebedeff, that I am terribly perplexed. Tell me, do you still think ... plainly, you say yourself that you suspect Mr. Ferdishenko?\"\n Lebedeff clasped his hands once more.\n \"Why, who else could I possibly suspect? Who else, most outspoken prince?\" he replied, with an unctuous smile.\n Muishkin frowned, and rose from his seat.\n \"You see, Lebedeff, a mistake here would be a dreadful thing. This Ferdishenko, I would not say a word against him, of course; but, who knows? Perhaps it really was he? I mean he really does seem to be a more likely man than... than any other.\"\n Lebedeff strained his eyes and ears to take in what the prince was saying. The latter was frowning more and more, and walking excitedly up and down, trying not to look at Lebedeff.\n \"You see,\" he said, \"I was given to understand that Ferdishenko was that sort of man,--that one can\u0027t say everything before him. One has to take care not to say too much, you understand? I say this to prove that he really is, so to speak, more likely to have done this than anyone else, eh? You understand? The important thing is, not to make a mistake.\"\n \"And who told you this about Ferdishenko?\"\n \"Oh, I was told. Of course I don\u0027t altogether believe it. I am very sorry that I should have had to say this, because I assure you I don\u0027t believe it myself; it is all nonsense, of course. It was stupid of me to say anything about it.\"\n \"You see, it is very important, it is most important to know where you got this report from,\" said Lebedeff, excitedly. He had risen from his seat, and was trying to keep step with the prince, running after him, up and down. \"Because look here, prince, I don\u0027t mind telling you now that as we were going along to Wilkin\u0027s this morning, after telling me what you know about the fire, and saving the count and all that, the general was pleased to drop certain hints to the same effect about Ferdishenko, but so vaguely and clumsily that I thought better to put a few questions to him on the matter, with the result that I found the whole thing was an invention of his excellency\u0027s own mind. Of course, he only lies with the best intentions; still, he lies. But, such being the case, where could you have heard the same report? It was the inspiration of the moment with him, you understand, so who could have told YOU? It is an important question, you see!\"\n \"It was Colia told me, and his father told HIM at about six this morning. They met at the threshold, when Colia was leaving the room for something or other.\" The prince told Lebedeff all that Colia had made known to himself, in detail.\n \"There now, that\u0027s what we may call SCENT!\" said Lebedeff, rubbing his hands and laughing silently. \"I thought it must be so, you see. The general interrupted his innocent slumbers, at six o\u0027clock, in order to go and wake his beloved son, and warn him of the dreadful danger of companionship with Ferdishenko. Dear me! what a dreadfully dangerous man Ferdishenko must be, and what touching paternal solicitude, on the part of his excellency, ha! ha! ha!\"\n \"Listen, Lebedeff,\" began the prince, quite overwhelmed; \"DO act quietly--don\u0027t make a scandal, Lebedeff, I ask you--I entreat you! No one must know--NO ONE, mind! In that case only, I will help you.\"\n \"Be assured, most honourable, most worthy of princes--be assured that the whole matter shall be buried within my heart!\" cried Lebedeff, in a paroxysm of exaltation. \"I\u0027d give every drop of my blood... Illustrious prince, I am a poor wretch in soul and spirit, but ask the veriest scoundrel whether he would prefer to deal with one like himself, or with a noble-hearted man like you, and there is no doubt as to his choice! He\u0027ll answer that he prefers the noble-hearted man--and there you have the triumph of virtue! Au revoir, honoured prince! You and I together--softly! softly!\"\n \n 走进自己的家门，叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜在第一个房间停下了，她不能再往前走，便坐到沙发床上。她完全筋疲力尽了，甚至忘了请公爵坐。这是一间相当大的堂屋、中间放苦一张园桌，有坠炉，靠窗的搁架上放着许多花，后面有一扇玻璃门通向花园。阿杰莱达和亚历山德拉立即走了进来，疑问和困惑地望着公爵和母亲。\n 小姐们在别墅通常在９点左右起床；只有阿格拉娅在最近两三天里起得稍早些并去花园散步，但是毕竟也不是７点，而是８点或者再晚些。叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫挪因为各种各样的疑虑不安确实彻夜未眠，在８点左右就起床了，有意想在花园里遇见阿格拉娅，因为以为她已经起床了；可是无论是在花园还是在卧室郁没有找到她。这下她可完全着了慌，就把两个大女儿叫回。“从女仆那里她们获悉，阿格拉娅·伊万诺夫闪还在６点多的时候就去了公园。小姐们嘲笑她们这个好发奇想的妹妹又冒出新的怪念来。便向妈因指出，如果她到公园去找她，阿格拉娅大概又会生气的，还说，现在她一定拿音书坐在绿色长椅上，还有三天前她说起过这张长椅，为此差点与ω公爵吵嘴，因为ω公爵认为这张长椅的位置并没有什么特别的地方。现在叶莉扎维浴·普罗科菲耶夫问回上了女儿的约会。听见了她所说的奇怪的活，不由得惊恐万分，这里有诸多原因，但是眼下把公爵带了来，她倒又为自己生出事来感到胆怯，因为“为什么阿格拉娅不能在公园里与公爵见面和谈话呢？甚至，说到底，假如这是他们事先讲好的约会，那又怎样呢？”\n “爵爷，您别以为，”她终于壮着胆说，“我把您拖到这儿来是要审问您……亲爱的，在发生了昨天晚上这种事后，本来我也许会很长时间不愿意见你……”\n 她稍稍停顿了一下。\n “但终究您很想知道，今天我怎么跟阿格拉娅·伊万诺夫娜见面的？”公爵相当平静地接着她的活把话说完。\n “那好吧，我是想知道！”叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜马上怒气勃发，“我不怕说真话。因为我没有委屈任何人，也不想委屈任何人……”\n “哪会呢，想知道是自然的事，不存在委屈谁这一点；您是母亲嘛。我今天早晨７点正在绿色长椅那儿会见阿格拉娅·伊万诺夫娜，是由于她昨天邀请了我。咋晚她用一张字条告诉我，她要见我并有要事跟我谈。我们见了面，谈了整整一小时，全是涉及阿格拉娅·伊万诺夫娜个人的事，这就是全部情况。”\n “当然，是全部情况，爵爷、毫无疑问就是这些情况，”叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜带着一副尊严的神情说。\n “好极了，公爵！”阿格拉娅突然走进房间说，“我衷心感谢您认为我不会低贱到撒谎。妈妈，您够了吧、或是还想审问？”\n “你知道，至今还没有什么事使我碍在你面前感到脸红……虽然你可能高兴看到那样，”叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜用教训的口气回答说，“再见，公爵；原谅我打扰了您。我希望，您依然相信我对您的尊敬是永远不变的。”\n 公爵立即朝两边行礼告辞，走了出来。亚历山德拉和阿杰莱达微微一笑，窃窃私议着什么。叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜严厉地看了她们一眼。\n “我们只是觉得好笑，妈妈，”阿杰莱达笑起来说，“公爵行礼的样子这么潇洒，有时候却完全笨拙得很，而现在一下子就像……就像叶甫盖尼·帕夫雷奇了。”\n “彬彬有礼和尊严体面是自己的心灵而不是舞蹈老师教出来的，”叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜讪讪地说完话，就上自己楼去了，对阿格拉娅连看都不看一眼。\n 公爵回到自己住处已经９点左右了，在露台上遇见了维拉·鲁基扬诺夫娜和女仆，她们正在一起收拾、打扫昨晚留下的杂乱无章的露台。\n “谢天谢地，我们总算在您来之前收拾好了！”维拉高兴地说。\n “您好，我有点头晕；我没有睡好；我想睡觉。”\n “像昨天一样，就睡这儿露台上？好。我去对大家说，让他们别吵醒您。爸爸不知去哪里了。”\n 女仆走出去了，维拉本来也要跟在她后面走的，但又回过来，忧心忡忡地走到公爵跟前。\n “公爵，您就可怜可怜这个……不幸的人吧，今天别赶他走。”\n “我绝不会赶他，随他自己怎么样。”\n “他现在什么也做不了，所以……您对他别太严厉。”\n “哦，不会的，何必呢？”\n “还有……您别笑他；这是最主要的。”\n “哦，绝对不会的！”\n “我真蠢，对您这样的人说这种话，”维拉的脸红了，“虽然您倦了，”她半转过身子准备走开，笑起来说，“可是此刻您的眼睛多么可爱……多么幸福。”\n “难道还幸福？”公爵生气勃勃地间，并高兴地大笑起来。”\n 但是像男孩一样天真纯朴、不拘礼节的维拉，突然不知怎么的变得不好意思起来，脸也更红了，仍然笑着，急匆匆走出了房间。\n “多么……可爱……”公爵想。但立即就忘了她。他走到露台一角，那儿有一张沙发躺椅，躺椅前有一张茶几，他坐下来，双手捂着脸坐了约１０分钟；突然急忙和不安地把手伸进侧袋，摸出了三封信。\n 但是门又开了，科利亚走了进来。公爵的手很高兴又得把信放回到口袋里和可以捱过一段时光。\n “嗨，真是一桩事件！”科利亚说着，就在沙发躺椅上坐下，像所有他这样的少年一样，直截了当地就切入话题，“现在您怎么看待伊波利特，不会尊重他了吧？”\n “为什么呢……不过，科利亚，我很疲倦了……而且再来开始谈这一切，太使人忧郁了……但是、他怎么样？”\n “在睡，还能睡两小时。我明白；您没在家里睡觉；在公园里徘徊……当然，心情激动……这还用说。”\n “您怎么知道我在公园里徘徊，不在家里睡觉？”\n “维拉刚才说的。她劝我别进来。我忍不住，耽一会儿。这两个小时我在床边值班；现在我让科斯佳·列别杰夫替班。布尔多夫斯基已经走了。所以，公爵，您就睡吧，祝您晚……日，祝您日安！只不过，您要知道，我非常惊诧！”\n “当然……所有这一切……”\n “不，公爵，不；我感到谅诧的是《自白》。主要是他讲到幽灵和未来生命的那个地方，这里面含着一个伟--大--的思想！”\n 公爵亲切地望着科利亚，他来的目的当然是想尽快谈谈这个伟大的思想。\n “但是，主要的，主要的不是一种思想，而是整个情境！如果伏尔泰、卢梭、普鲁东写了这份东西，我会去读，会发觉新思想，但不会惊诧到这种程度，但是，一个确实知道自己只能活１０分钟的人说这一番话，这可是令人骄傲的！这可是个人人格独立的最高表现，这可是意味着直面勇对人生……不，这是伟大的精神力量！在这之后断定他故意不放上火帽，这就太卑下、太不自然！可是您要知道，昨天他们是欺骗了大家，耍了个花招：我根本没有跟他一起把东西装进旅行包，也从未见过手枪；是他自己收拾东西的，因此他一下子把我弄糊涂了。维拉说，您留他在这儿住；我起誓，不会有危险，何况我们大家都寸步不离守着他。”\n “昨天夜里你们中谁在那里？”\n “我，科斯佳·列别杰夫，布尔多夫斯墓；凯勒尔稍稍耽了一会，后来就到列别杰夫那儿睡觉去了，因为我们那里没有床钠好睡。费尔迪先科也睡在列别杰夫那里，７点钟就走了。将军总是在列别杰夫那儿的，现在也走了……列别杰夫可能马上就会到您这儿来；不知道有什么事，他在找您，问过两次了。如果您现在躺下回的话，要不要放他进来？我也要去睡了。啊，对了，我想对您说件事；刚才将军让我吃了一惊：６点多时布尔多夫斯基叫醒我去值班，甚至几乎是６点钟的时候；我出去了一会，突然遇见了将军，而且还醉得到了不认识我的地步：像根木柱子似的站在我面前；刚清醒过来就冲着我问：‘病人怎么样了？我来是打听病人槽况的……，我向他报告了，嗨，如此这般等等。‘这一切很好，’他说，‘但我是，我起早，主要是为了警告你；我有理由认为，当着费尔迪先科的面不能什么话都说，应该有所克制。’您明白吗，公爵？”\n “难道有这样的事？不过……对我们来说反正无所谓。”\n “是的，没有疑问，这无所谓，我们不是共济会会员！因此我甚至感到奇怪，将军竞为此而特意夜里来叫醒我。”\n “您说，费尔迪先科走了，是吗？”\n “７点钟走的；顺便到我这儿来了一下，我在值班！他说，他去维尔金那里睡个足。维尔金是个十足的酒鬼。好了，我走了：瞧，鲁基扬·季莫菲伊奇来了……公爵想睡觉，鲁基扬·季莫菲伊奇；往回走！”\n “仅仅耽１分钟，我深深敬重的公爵，有件在我看来有点重要的事，”进来的列别杰夫拖长了声音，用一种洞察一切的口吻轻声说着，并且庄重地鞠了个躬。他刚回来，甚至还未及回自己房间，因此还拿着帽子在乎中，他的脸流露出忧虑，还带着特别的不同寻常的自尊神情，。公爵请他坐下。\n “您两次问起过我？大概，您始终为昨晚的事感到不安……”\n “公爵，您是说为昨天这男孩的事？哦，不；昨天我的思想很紊乱……但是今天我已经不打算同您的意见争执了，无论在什么方面。”\n “争……您怎么说的？”\n “我说：争执，是个法语词，像许多其他词一样，已经进入我们俄语了，但我并不特别主张用这个词。”\n “列别杰夫，您今天怎么这样一本正经，循规蹈矩，说起话来咬文嚼字的，”公爵微微一笑说。\n “尼古拉·阿尔达利翁诺维奇，”列别杰夫几乎用一种使人怜悯的声音对科利亚说，“我有一件事要告诉公爵，涉及到本人……”\n “哦，对，当然，当然，这不关我的事。再见，公爵！”科利亚马上就走开了。\n “我喜欢这孩子的明白知趣，”望着他背影列别杰夫说，“这小家伙挺灵巧，虽然挺缠人的。深深敬爱的公爵，我遭受了一件异常不幸的事，是昨天晚上还是今天清晨……我还捉摸不定确切的时间。”\n “是什么事情？”\n “侧袋里丢了四百卢布，深深敬爱的公爵；大家正给您庆贺生日，”列别杰夫苦笑着补了一句。\n “您丢失了四百卢布？这真遗憾。”\n “特别是对一个靠自己的劳动正直生活的穷人来说是这样。”\n “当然，当然，怎么会这样的？”\n “是喝酒造成的后果。我来找您是把您看做神明，深深敬爱的公爵，四百银卢布这笔款子我是在昨天下午５点钟时从一个债主那里得到的，接着就坐火车回到这里。皮夹放在口袋里。我换下制服穿上常礼眼，把钱放进常礼服，我想到了要把钱放在身边，打算晚上应人家的请求把钱交出去……就等代理人来。”\n “顺便问一句，鲁基扬·季真菲伊奇，您在报上登过广告说，您收金银物品作抵押付款，这是真的吗？”\n “是通过代理人；不用我自己的名字，也不用我的地址。我本钱微不足道，又因为添了人了，您自己也会同意，收一点正当的利息……”\n “是的，是的；我不过是了解一下；对不起，我打断了您。”\n “代理人没有来一而那时又送来了那个不幸的人；午餐后我已经处于一种亢奋状态；来了这些客人，喝了……茶，……我很快活，却不料大祸临头。当时已很晚了，凯勒尔进来宣布您的大庆日子，并吩咐拿出香槟来，亲爱的深深敬重的公爵，我有一颗心（您大概已经发觉了，因为我是配得到这一点的），我有一颗心，我不说赤胆忠心，但可以说是知恩图报的，我还以此引以为豪。为了使准备中的聚会更加庄重，我个人也等着祝贺您，我忽然想到去，换下家常便服，穿上回家后脱下的制服，我这么做了，公爵，您大概也注意到了我一晚上都穿着制眼。我换了衣服，却忘了放在家常便服中的皮夹。哦……上帝想要惩罚人的时候，首先剥夺你的理智，真是这样。直到今天，己经７点半了，我醒来时，像个疯子似的从床上跳起来，第一件事就是去抓那件常礼眼，一只是一只空口袋。皮夹子已音无踪迹。”\n “呵，这真不愉快。”\n “确实不愉快，您刚才找到的合适字眼真是得体，”列别杰夫不无狡黠地添了一句说。\n “不过，怎么会……”公爵若有所思，颇感不安地说，“这可是很严重的情况。”\n “确实严重，您又找了另一个字眼，公爵，为了表示……”\n “啊，够了，鲁基扬“·季莫菲伊奇，这用得着找字眼吗？重要的不是字眼……您认为，您喝醉时皮夹子会不会从您口袋里掉出来了？”\n “可能的。正如您坦率地所说的那样，喝醉时什么都有可能，我深深敬爱的公爵！但是，我请您判断一下：如果换衣服时我把皮夹子抖落出来了，那么掉下来的东西应该就在那里地板上。现在这东西在什么地方呢？”\n “您不会把它塞到桌子抽屉里什么地方了？”\n “全部找遍了，到处都找过了，何况我没有往哪儿藏过，也没有开过任何抽屉，这点我记得很清楚。”\n “看过柜子里吗？”\n “第一件事就看那里，今天甚至已经看了好几遍了……再说我怎么会塞到柜子里去呢，我衷心尊敬的公爵？”\n “我承认，列别杰夫，这很使我不安。这么说，有人在地板上捡了它？”\n “或者从口袋里偷的，二者必居其一。”\n “这使我非常不安；因为到底是谁……这就是问题所在。”\n “毫无疑问，主要的问题就在这里，您用词之确切、表达思想之恰当，分析情况之精确真令人惊讶，公爵阁下。”\n “啊，鲁基扬·季莫菲伊奇，别嘲弄人了，这里……”\n “嘲弄！”列别杰夫双手一拍，大声嚷了起来。\n “算了，算了，算了，好吧，我可不是生气，这里完全是另一回事……我担心的是人们。您怀疑是谁？”\n “这是个最难知……最复杂的问题！我不怀疑女仆：她呆在自己厨房里。也不是亲生的孩子们……”\n “这还用说。”\n “看来，是客人中的什么人。”\n “但这可能吗？”\n “这是完全不可能，最大的不可能，可是又必定是这么回事。不过、我同意做这样的设想，甚至确信，如果是偷窃，那么不会是在晚上发生的，因为当时大家都聚集在一起，而会是在夜里或者甚至是在快要到清晨的时候，是在这里过夜的哪个人干的。”\n “啊，我的天哪！”\n “自然，布尔多夫斯基和居古拉·阿尔达利翁诺维奇我是排除在外的，因为他们没有进我的房间。”\n “这还用说，甚至即使他们走进去过也不会！谁在您那里过夜的？”\n “连我在内，我们有四个人，住在两个相邻的房间：我，将军，凯勒尔和费尔迪先科先生。看来，是我们四人中的一个！”\n “也就是三个中的某一个，但是谁呢？”\n “我把自己算在内是为了公正，也为了合乎规矩，但是，公爵，您也会同意，我不可能自己偷自己，虽然世上也常有这样的事……”\n “啊，列别杰夫，这多无聊！”公爵不耐烦地高声说，“说正经的，您干吗拖拖拉拉的！……”\n “这就是说，剩下三个人，首先是凯勒尔先生。这个人反复无常，总是醉醺醺的，在某些方面是自由主义者，也就是说到钱袋的事，其他方面带有的倾向，与其说是自由主义，不如说是古代骑士式的。他在这里起先是在病人的房间里，已经半夜里了才换到我们这里来，借口说睡在光地板上太硬了。”\n “您怀疑是他？”\n “我怀疑过。当我在早晨７点多时像疯子似的一跳而起用手贴住前额的时候，马上叫醒了睡着安稳觉的将军。考虑到费尔迪先科奇怪地消失踪影，这一点已经引起了我们的怀疑，我们俩立即决定搜索凯勒尔，他睡得像……像……几乎就像死猪一股。我们完完全全搜了个遍：口袋里一个子几也没有，甚至没有一个口袋是没有窟窿的。方格蓝布手帕脏得不成样子。还有一封情书，是哪个女仆写的，信中向他要钱并进行威胁，再就是您知道的那篇小品文的碎片。将军认为他是无辜的。为了彻底弄清楚我们叫醒了他本人，好容易才推醒了他；他勉强弄明白是怎么回事，张大了嘴巴，一副醉态，脸上的表情是怪诞、无辜的，甚至是愚蠢的，－－不是他！”\n “哦，我真高兴！”公爵高兴地叹了口气，“我曾多么为他担心！”\n “担心？看来，您已经有理由怀疑了？”列别杰夫眯缝着眼说。\n “哦，不，我是这么说说的，”公爵语塞了。“我说担心，真是愚蠢得可以。列别杰夫，帮帮忙，别把这话传给任何人……”\n “公爵，公爵！您的话在我的心里……在我心里深处，那里就是坟墓！……”列别杰夫把礼服贴在心坎处，激昂地说。\n “好，”好！……这么说，是贫尔迪先科？也就是，我想说，您怀疑费尔迪先科？\n “还有谁呢？”列别杰夫凝神望着公爵，悄悄地说。\n “哦，是的，当然喏……还会有谁……就是说，我又说错了，有什么证据呢？”\n “证据是有的。首先，他是在早晨７点，甚至是６点多时消失的。”\n “我知道，科利亚对我说过，费尔迪先科到他那里去了一下，说要到……我忘了，到谁那里，到一个好朋友家去睡个足。”\n “是到维尔金那里。这么说，尼古拉·阿尔达利翁诺维奇已经对您说了？”\n “他一点也没提及失窃的事。”\n “他是不知道，因为暂时我还对此事保密。这么说，他去维尔金家了；似乎事情没什么好奇怪的，一个醉汉到另一个跟他自己一样的醉汉那里去，尽管天还刚刚亮，又没有任何理由。但是这里却露出了踪迹：他走了，却留下了地址……现在，公爵，请注意一个问题：他为什么要留下地址？……为什么他绕个弯，特意去尼古拉· 阿尔达利翁诺维奇那儿并告诉他‘去维尔金家里睡个足’。谁对他要走，甚至他正是要去维尔金那里感兴趣？为什么要告诉人家？不，这里有精妙之处，小偷的精妙之处，这就是说：‘瞧，我故意不隐瞒我的行踪，我怎么会是小偷呢？难道小偷会告诉他到哪儿去的吗？，这是一种想排除怀疑的过分的细心，也就是说，想擦去沙地上的足迹……您明白我的意思吗，我深深敬爱的公爵？”\n “明白，非常清楚地明白，但是这可是不够的。”\n “第二条理由：他的行踪是假的，他给的地址是不准确的。过了１小阶，也就是８点钟的时候，我已经去敲维尔金的门了，他住在五条街，我甚至还认识他。赞尔迪先科的影子也没有。虽然从女仆那里（她完全是个聋子）追问出来，一个小时前确有某个人敲过门，甚至用的劲相当大，连门铃也扯断了。但是女仆没有开门，她不想叫醒维尔金先生，也可能是她自己不愿意起来。这种事也常有。”\n “这就是您的全部证据吗？这不够。”\n “公爵，那么该怀疑谁呢，您倒判断判断？”列别杰夫非常动人地结束说，在他的苦笑中闪现出某种经验的神情。\n “您再好好看看房间和抽屉！”公爵沉思片刻后忧虑地说。\n “细细看过了！”列别杰夫更加动人地叹了口气说。\n “嗯！……何必，您何必要换掉这件常礼服呢？”公爵烦恼地敲了一下桌子，感叹道。\n “这是一出古老喜剧中提的问题。但是，心地无比善良的公爵，您把我的不幸已经太往心里去了！我不配这样对待。也就是说，我一个人不敢当；但是您也在为罪犯……为微不足道的费尔迪先科先生感到痛苦，是吗？”\n “是的，是的，您确实使我很不安，”公爵心不在焉和不满地打断了他的话，“那么，既然您这么深信这是费尔迪先科于的、您打算做什么呢？……”\n “公爵，我深深敬爱的公爵，别人还会是谁呢？”列别杰夫用越来越受感动的腔调巴结着说。“要知道没有别的人可以设想为那个人，因而，除了费尔迪先科先生，完全不可能怀疑别的人，要知道，这么说吧，这又是一条不利于费尔迪先科的证据，已经是第三条了：因为还是这个问题：别的人还会是谁？总不见得我该怀疑布尔多夫斯基先生吧，嘻－嘻！”\n “照您，多么荒谬！”\n “最后，总不是将军吧。嘻－嘻？”\n “简直胡说八道！”公爵几乎生气地说，他不耐烦地在座位上转来转去。\n “还用说不是胡说八道吗，嘻－嘻！这个人，也就是将军，真把我逗笑了，刚才我跟他趁热打铁追踪到维尔金家……应该向您指出，当我失窃后首先叫醒他时，将军比我还要感到震惊，甚至脸色都变了，红一阵，白一阵，最后突然显得部样正义凛然，表示着强烈的义愤，我甚至都没有料到会到那种程度。真是个正人君子！他经常吹牛，这是他的癖好，但是是个有高尚情操的人，同时他又是个缺少心眼的人，他的纯真无邪可以令人充分信任他。我已经对您说了，我深深敬爱的公爵，我对他不仅有好感，而且喜欢他。突然他停在街中央，解开常礼服，敞开胸，说‘搜搜我，您搜过凯勒尔，为什么不搜我呢？公正要求这样做，他手脚都抖动着，甚至脸变得雪白，一副威严可恨的样子。我笑了起来，说，‘听着，将军，如果别人对我这样说你，我立即用自己的双手把我的头颅取下来，将它放在一只大盘子里并亲自端给所有怀疑你的人，对他们说：瞧，看见这颗脑袋了吧，我就用自己的这颗脑袋为他担保，不仅，是脑袋，甚至还可以赴汤蹈火。瞧我准备怎么为你担保。”他当即扑过来拥抱我，仍然在大街中央，眼泪夺眶而出，浑身颤粟着，紧紧地招我搂在胸前（弄得我甚至差点咳嗽起来。）他说：‘你是我患难中留下的唯一的朋友！，真是个易动感情的人！于是，当然罗，一路上他立即讲了个类似境遇的坏事，说年轻时有一次他被怀疑偷了５００卢布，但是，第二天他扑进熊熊燃烧的房子，从火中拖出了怀疑他的伯爵和当时还是少女的尼娜·亚历山德罗夫娜。伯爵拥抱了他，这样就有了他和尼娜·亚历山德罗夫娜的婚姻，而次日在火灾的废墟中找到了装着失款的盒子；这是一只英国构造、带暗锁的铁盒，不知怎么的掉到地板底下去，因此谁也没有发觉它，直到这场火灾后才找到。这纯粹是胡说。但是他说到尼娜·亚历山德罗夫娜时，甚至叹泣起来。尼娜·亚历山德罗夫娜是个气度高贵的妇人，尽管她生我的气。”\n “你们不认识？”\n “几乎不认识，但我真心诚意想和她认识，哪怕只是为了在她面前辩解。尼娜·亚历山德罗夫对我有所不满，认为似乎是我现在腐蚀了他丈夫，使他酗酒。但我不仅没有腐蚀他，反而还劝阻他；也许，我现在正使他摆脱有害的家伙。再说他是我的朋友，我向您承认，我现在不会撇下他，也就是说，他去哪儿，我也去哪儿，因为唯有重感情才能把握他。现在他甚至完全不去拜访自己的大尉妻子了，虽然暗中非常想去见她，有时甚至为她唉声叹气，特别是每天早晨起床穿靴子那一会，不知道为什么正是这个时候。他没有钱，槽就槽在这里，而没有钱无论如何也休想去她那里。他没有向您要过钱吗？我深深敬爱的公爵？”\n “没有，没有要过。”\n “他不好意思。他本来想过的，甚至向我承认，他想来麻烦您，但是不好意思，因为不久前您才借钱给他，加上他认为您不会给的。他把我当朋友才吐露这话的。”\n “那您没有给他钱吗？”\n “公爵！我深深敬爱的公爵！不光是钱，为了这个人，这么说吧，甚至生命……不，不过我不想夸大，不是生命，但是可以这样说，为了这个人我真的愿意经受一次热病，害一个脓肿或者甚至咳嗽，只要有非常的必要；因为我认为他是个伟大的但又是个沉沦的人！就是这样！不光是钱！”\n “这么说，您给他钱了？”\n “没有，钱我没有给，他自己知道，我是不会给的，但要知道唯一的目的是使他节制和改正。现在缠着要跟我一起去彼得堡；我去彼得堡可是为了要趁热打铁追踪费尔迪先科先生，因为我肯定他已经在那里了，我的将军也急得像热锅上的蚂蚁，但我怀疑，到了彼得堡他会从我身边偷偷溜走，好去找大尉妻子。我承认，我甚至会故意放他走，我们已经讲好，一到被得堡就立即兵分两路，以便更容易抓住费尔迪先科先生。我就这样要先把他放了。然后突然像雪落到头上一样，去大尉妻子那里回见他，--其实，是要使他感到羞愧，作为一个有家室的人，作为一个一般所说的人，他应该得这一点。”\n “只不过别闹得。满城风雨，列别杰夫，为了上帝，别闹得满城风雨，”公爵感到强烈不安，悄声说。\n “哦，不会的，其实只是为了使他感到羞愧、同时也闪看看他是一副什么模样，因为根据模样可以做出许多结论，我尊敬的公爵，特别是这样的人！啊，公爵！尽管我自己遭到这么大的不幸，但是甚至现在我还是不能不想到他，不能不想到怎样纠正他的道德，我深深敬爱的公爵，我对您有个不同寻常的请求，我坦白地说、甚至正是为了这点才来的（您已经跟他们家熟悉了）甚至还在他们那里住过；要是您，心地无比善良的公民，您决定在这件事上协助我，其实只是为了将军一人和他的幸福……”\n 列别杰夫甚至交叉起双手，犹如祈祷那样。\n “什么事情于怎么协助？请相信，我相当愿意完全理解您，列别杰夫。”\n “我到您这儿来唯一怀着的就是这种信心。通过尼娜·亚历山德罗夫娜可以起作用；这么说吧；可以在他自己家里内部观察、注意他这位阁下。不幸的是，我跟他家不熟悉……况且这里还有尼古拉·阿尔达利翁诺维奇，他崇拜您，可以说，是出于少年的一片真心，他大概也会帮忙的……”\n “不，上帝保佑，别把尼娜·亚历山记罗夫娜扯进这件事上……还有科利亚……不过可能我还没有理解您的用意，列别杰夫。”\n “这里根本没什么要理解的！”列别杰夫甚至在椅子上跳将起来，“只要感情的温柔，这就是我们病人的全部药物。公爵，您允许我把他看做是病人吧？”\n “这甚至显示出您的委婉和智慧。”\n “我举一个例子给您解释，为了明白起见我就用一个实例。您瞧，这是个什么人：他现在一心恋着这个大尉妻子，而没有钱是不能上她那儿的，今天我就打算在她那儿抓获他，这是为他幸福着想；但是，假定说，不光是大尉妻子的事，而是甚至犯了真正的罪行，啼，某桩最可耻的行为（虽然他根本不会这样做），那么到那时，我说，也只要用高尚的温情，这么说吧，你就能了解他的一切，因为他是个重感情的人！请相信，他熬不过五天，自己就会讲出来，会痛哭流涕，承认一切；如果做得巧妙和高尚，通过家庭和您对他进行一切监视，这么说吧，监视他的一举一动……尤其能如此：哦，心地无比善良的公爵！”列别杰夫甚至颇为感奋地跳起来说，“我可不断定他一定……可以说，我愿意哪怕是现在为他流淌我的全部鲜血，虽然您也会同意，没有节制地酗酒，大尉妻子这一切加在一起是会导致一切后果的。”\n “这样的目的，我当然总是愿意帮助的，”公爵站起来说，“只不过我向您承认，列别杰夫，我现在心里不安得不得了；您说，您不是一直……总之，您自己说的、您怀疑费尔迪先科先生。”\n “还会有谁\n \n
