{"id":7407,"no":28,"title":"Part 2 Chapter 12","content":"IT was seven in the evening, and the prince was just preparing to go out for a walk in the park, when suddenly Mrs. Epanchin appeared on the terrace.\n \"In the first place, don\u0027t dare to suppose,\" she began, \"that I am going to apologize. Nonsense! You were entirely to blame.\"\n The prince remained silent.\n \"Were you to blame, or not?\"\n \"No, certainly not, no more than yourself, though at first I thought I was.\"\n \"Oh, very well, let\u0027s sit down, at all events, for I don\u0027t intend to stand up all day. And remember, if you say, one word about \u0027mischievous urchins,\u0027 I shall go away and break with you altogether. Now then, did you, or did you not, send a letter to Aglaya, a couple of months or so ago, about Easter-tide?\"\n \"Yes!\"\n \"What for? What was your object? Show me the letter.\" Mrs. Epanchin\u0027s eyes flashed; she was almost trembling with impatience.\n \"I have not got the letter,\" said the prince, timidly, extremely surprised at the turn the conversation had taken. \"If anyone has it, if it still exists, Aglaya Ivanovna must have it.\"\n \"No finessing, please. What did you write about?\"\n \"I am not finessing, and I am not in the least afraid of telling you; but I don\u0027t see the slightest reason why I should not have written.\"\n \"Be quiet, you can talk afterwards! What was the letter about? Why are you blushing?\"\n The prince was silent. At last he spoke.\n \"I don\u0027t understand your thoughts, Lizabetha Prokofievna; but I can see that the fact of my having written is for some reason repugnant to you. You must admit that I have a perfect right to refuse to answer your questions; but, in order to show you that I am neither ashamed of the letter, nor sorry that I wrote it, and that I am not in the least inclined to blush about it \"(here the prince\u0027s blushes redoubled), \"I will repeat the substance of my letter, for I think I know it almost by heart.\"\n So saying, the prince repeated the letter almost word for word, as he had written it.\n \"My goodness, what utter twaddle, and what may all this nonsense have signified, pray? If it had any meaning at all!\" said Mrs. Epanchin, cuttingly, after having listened with great attention.\n \"I really don\u0027t absolutely know myself; I know my feeling was very sincere. I had moments at that time full of life and hope.\"\n \"What sort of hope?\"\n \"It is difficult to explain, but certainly not the hopes you have in your mind. Hopes--well, in a word, hopes for the future, and a feeling of joy that THERE, at all events, I was not entirely a stranger and a foreigner. I felt an ecstasy in being in my native land once more; and one sunny morning I took up a pen and wrote her that letter, but why to HER, I don\u0027t quite know. Sometimes one longs to have a friend near, and I evidently felt the need of one then,\" added the prince, and paused.\n \"Are you in love with her?\"\n \"N-no! I wrote to her as to a sister; I signed myself her brother.\"\n \"Oh yes, of course, on purpose! I quite understand.\"\n \"It is very painful to me to answer these questions, Lizabetha Prokofievna.\"\n \"I dare say it is; but that\u0027s no affair of mine. Now then, assure me truly as before Heaven, are you lying to me or not?\"\n \"No, I am not lying.\"\n \"Are you telling the truth when you say you are not in love?\"\n \"I believe it is the absolute truth.\"\n \"\u0027I believe,\u0027 indeed! Did that mischievous urchin give it to her?\"\n \"I asked Nicolai Ardalionovitch . . .\"\n \"The urchin! the urchin!\" interrupted Lizabetha Prokofievna in an angry voice. \"I do not want to know if it were Nicolai Ardalionovitch! The urchin!\"\n \"Nicolai Ardalionovitch . . .\"\n \"The urchin, I tell you!\"\n \"No, it was not the urchin: it was Nicolai Ardalionovitch,\" said the prince very firmly, but without raising his voice.\n \"Well, all right! All right, my dear! I shall put that down to your account.\"\n She was silent a moment to get breath, and to recover her composure.\n \"Well!--and what\u0027s the meaning of the \u0027poor knight,\u0027 eh?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know in the least; I wasn\u0027t present when the joke was made. It IS a joke. I suppose, and that\u0027s all.\"\n \"Well, that\u0027s a comfort, at all events. You don\u0027t suppose she could take any interest in you, do you? Why, she called you an \u0027idiot\u0027 herself.\"\n \"I think you might have spared me that,\" murmured the prince reproachfully, almost in a whisper.\n \"Don\u0027t be angry; she is a wilful, mad, spoilt girl. If she likes a person she will pitch into him, and chaff him. I used to be just such another. But for all that you needn\u0027t flatter yourself, my boy; she is not for you. I don\u0027t believe it, and it is not to be. I tell you so at once, so that you may take proper precautions. Now, I want to hear you swear that you are not married to that woman?\"\n \"Lizabetha Prokofievna, what are you thinking of?\" cried the prince, almost leaping to his feet in amazement.\n \"Why? You very nearly were, anyhow.\"\n \"Yes--I nearly was,\" whispered the prince, hanging his head.\n \"Well then, have you come here for HER? Are you in love with HER? With THAT creature?\"\n \"I did not come to marry at all,\" replied the prince.\n \"Is there anything you hold sacred?\"\n \"There is.\"\n \"Then swear by it that you did not come here to marry HER!\"\n \"I\u0027ll swear it by whatever you please.\"\n \"I believe you. You may kiss me; I breathe freely at last. But you must know, my dear friend, Aglaya does not love you, and she shall never be your wife while I am out of my grave. So be warned in time. Do you hear me?\"\n \"Yes, I hear.\"\n The prince flushed up so much that he could not look her in the face.\n \"I have waited for you with the greatest impatience (not that you were worth it). Every night I have drenched my pillow with tears, not for you, my friend, not for you, don\u0027t flatter yourself! I have my own grief, always the same, always the same. But I\u0027ll tell you why I have been awaiting you so impatiently, because I believe that Providence itself sent you to be a friend and a brother to me. I haven\u0027t a friend in the world except Princess Bielokonski, and she is growing as stupid as a sheep from old age. Now then, tell me, yes or no? Do you know why she called out from her carriage the other night?\"\n \"I give you my word of honour that I had nothing to do with the matter and know nothing about it.\"\n \"Very well, I believe you. I have my own ideas about it. Up to yesterday morning I thought it was really Evgenie Pavlovitch who was to blame; now I cannot help agreeing with the others. But why he was made such a fool of I cannot understand. However, he is not going to marry Aglaya, I can tell you that. He may be a very excellent fellow, but--so it shall be. I was not at all sure of accepting him before, but now I have quite made up my mind that I won\u0027t have him. \u0027Put me in my coffin first and then into my grave, and then you may marry my daughter to whomsoever you please,\u0027 so I said to the general this very morning. You see how I trust you, my boy.\"\n \"Yes, I see and understand.\"\n Mrs. Epanchin gazed keenly into the prince\u0027s eyes. She was anxious to see what impression the news as to Evgenie Pavlovitch had made upon him.\n \"Do you know anything about Gavrila Ardalionovitch?\" she asked at last.\n \"Oh yes, I know a good deal.\"\n \"Did you know he had communications with Aglaya?\"\n \"No, I didn\u0027t,\" said the prince, trembling a little, and in great agitation. \"You say Gavrila Ardalionovitch has private communications with Aglaya?--Impossible!\"\n \"Only quite lately. His sister has been working like a rat to clear the way for him all the winter.\"\n \"I don\u0027t believe it!\" said the prince abruptly, after a short pause. \"Had it been so I should have known long ago.\"\n \"Oh, of course, yes; he would have come and wept out his secret on your bosom. Oh, you simpleton--you simpleton! Anyone can deceive you and take you in like a--like a,--aren\u0027t you ashamed to trust him? Can\u0027t you see that he humbugs you just as much as ever he pleases?\"\n \"I know very well that he does deceive me occasionally, and he knows that I know it, but--\" The prince did not finish his sentence.\n \"And that\u0027s why you trust him, eh? So I should have supposed. Good Lord, was there ever such a man as you? Tfu! and are you aware, sir, that this Gania, or his sister Varia, have brought her into correspondence with Nastasia Philipovna?\"\n \"Brought whom?\" cried Muishkin.\n \"Aglaya.\"\n \"I don\u0027t believe it! It\u0027s impossible! What object could they have?\" He jumped up from his chair in his excitement.\n \"Nor do I believe it, in spite of the proofs. The girl is self- willed and fantastic, and insane! She\u0027s wicked, wicked! I\u0027ll repeat it for a thousand years that she\u0027s wicked; they ALL are, just now, all my daughters, even that \u0027wet hen\u0027 Alexandra. And yet I don\u0027t believe it. Because I don\u0027t choose to believe it, perhaps; but I don\u0027t. Why haven\u0027t you been?\" she turned on the prince suddenly. \"Why didn\u0027t you come near us all these three days, eh?\"\n The prince began to give his reasons, but she interrupted him again.\n \"Everybody takes you in and deceives you; you went to town yesterday. I dare swear you went down on your knees to that rogue, and begged him to accept your ten thousand roubles!\"\n \"I never thought of doing any such thing. I have not seen him, and he is not a rogue, in my opinion. I have had a letter from him.\"\n \"Show it me!\"\n The prince took a paper from his pocket-book, and handed it to Lizabetha Prokofievna. It ran as follows:\n \"SIR,\n \"In the eyes of the world I am sure that I have no cause for pride or self-esteem. I am much too insignificant for that. But what may be so to other men\u0027s eyes is not so to yours. I am convinced that you are better than other people. Doktorenko disagrees with me, but I am content to differ from him on this point. I will never accept one single copeck from you, but you have helped my mother, and I am bound to be grateful to you for that, however weak it may seem. At any rate, I have changed my opinion about you, and I think right to inform you of the fact; but I also suppose that there can be no further inter course between us \" ANTIP BURDOVSKY.\n \"P.S.--The two hundred roubles I owe you shall certainly be repaid in time.\"\n \"How extremely stupid!\" cried Mrs. Epanchin, giving back the letter abruptly. \"It was not worth the trouble of reading. Why are you smiling?\"\n \"Confess that you are pleased to have read it.\"\n \"What! Pleased with all that nonsense! Why, cannot you see that they are all infatuated with pride and vanity?\"\n \"He has acknowledged himself to be in the wrong. Don\u0027t you see that the greater his vanity, the more difficult this admission must have been on his part? Oh, what a little child you are, Lizabetha Prokofievna!\"\n \"Are you tempting me to box your ears for you, or what?\"\n \"Not at all. I am only proving that you are glad about the letter. Why conceal your real feelings? You always like to do it.\"\n \"Never come near my house again!\" cried Mrs. Epanchin, pale with rage. \"Don\u0027t let me see as much as a SHADOW of you about the place! Do you hear?\"\n \"Oh yes, and in three days you\u0027ll come and invite me yourself. Aren\u0027t you ashamed now? These are your best feelings; you are only tormenting yourself.\"\n \"I\u0027ll die before I invite you! I shall forget your very name! I\u0027ve forgotten it already!\"\n She marched towards the door.\n \"But I\u0027m forbidden your house as it is, without your added threats!\" cried the prince after her.\n \"What? Who forbade you?\"\n She turned round so suddenly that one might have supposed a needle had been stuck into her.\n The prince hesitated. He perceived that he had said too much now.\n \"WHO forbade you?\" cried Mrs. Epanchin once more.\n \"Aglaya Ivanovna told me--\"\n \"When? Speak--quick!\"\n \"She sent to say, yesterday morning, that I was never to dare to come near the house again.\"\n Lizabetha Prokofievna stood like a stone.\n \"What did she send? Whom? Was it that boy? Was it a message?- quick!\"\n \"I had a note,\" said the prince.\n \"Where is it? Give it here, at once.\"\n The prince thought a moment. Then he pulled out of his waistcoat pocket an untidy slip of paper, on which was scrawled:\n \"PRINCE LEF NICOLAIEVITCH,--If you think fit, after all that has passed, to honour our house with a visit, I can assure you you will not find me among the number of those who are in any way delighted to see you.\n \"AGLAYA EPANCHIN.\"\n Mrs. Epanchin reflected a moment. The next minute she flew at the prince, seized his hand, and dragged him after her to the door.\n \"Quick--come along!\" she cried, breathless with agitation and impatience. \"Come along with me this moment!\"\n \"But you declared I wasn\u0027t--\"\n \"Don\u0027t be a simpleton. You behave just as though you weren\u0027t a man at all. Come on! I shall see, now, with my own eyes. I shall see all.\"\n \"Well, let me get my hat, at least.\"\n \"Here\u0027s your miserable hat He couldn\u0027t even choose a respectable shape for his hat! Come on! She did that because I took your part and said you ought to have come--little vixen!--else she would never have sent you that silly note. It\u0027s a most improper note, I call it; most improper for such an intelligent, well-brought-up girl to write. H\u0027m! I dare say she was annoyed that you didn\u0027t come; but she ought to have known that one can\u0027t write like that to an idiot like you, for you\u0027d be sure to take it literally.\" Mrs. Epanchin was dragging the prince along with her all the time, and never let go of his hand for an instant. \"What are you listening for?\" she added, seeing that she had committed herself a little. \"She wants a clown like you--she hasn\u0027t seen one for some time--to play with. That\u0027s why she is anxious for you to come to the house. And right glad I am that she\u0027ll make a thorough good fool of you. You deserve it; and she can do it--oh! she can, indeed!--as well as most people.\"\n \n 下午７点钟。公爵打算去花园。突然叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜独自一人来到露台上找他。\n “首先，你别以为，”她开始说，“我到你这儿来是来请求原谅的，简直荒唐！你完全是错的。”\n 公爵没有吭声。\n “你有没有错。”\n “跟您一样。其实，无论是我还是您，我们俩都没有故意犯什么过错。前天我曾经认为自己有错，而现在我得出结论，不是这么回事。”\n “原来你这样想！那好吧，请坐下来听着，因为我不打算站着。”\n 两人都坐了下来。\n “其次，关于那一伙可恶的小子别说一个字，我跟你坐谈１０分钟；我到你这儿来是要问一件事（天知道你想些什么？），如果你哪怕是一个字提到那帮无礼的小子，我马上就起身离开，并且跟你彻底决裂。”\n “好，”公爵回答道。\n “请问：两个月或两个半月前，复活节左右。你是不是给阿格拉娅寄来过一封信？”\n “写过。”\n “什么目的？信里写了些什么？把信拿出来！”\n 叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜的眼睛的的生光，她几乎上焦躁得打颤。\n “我这儿没有信，”公爵惊讶而又十分畏怯地说，“如果信还留着，那么是在阿格拉娅·伊万诺夫娜那里。”\n “别耍滑头，你写了些什么？”\n “我没有耍滑头，我也什么都不怕。我看不出有什么原因，为什么我不能写信……”\n “住口！你以后再说。信里讲些什么？为什么脸红了？”\n 公爵想了一下。\n “我不知道您的想法，叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜。我只知道，您很不喜欢这封信。您得同意，我本来可以拒绝回答这样的问题，但是为了向您表示，我并不害怕写过这封信、也不后悔写了这封信，我脸红也绝不是因为这封信（公爵脸红得几乎加了倍），我就给您念这封信，因为我好像还背得出。”\n 说完，公爵几乎一字不漏地照原信背了出来。\n “简直是胡言乱语！在你看来，这种荒谬的言词意味着什么？”叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜异常专注地听完信后，尖刻地问。\n “我自己也完全不知道；我知道，我的感情是比较诚挚的。在那里我曾有过充满生命和巨大希望的时刻。”\n “什么希望？”\n “很难解释，只不过不是您现在所想到的那种希望，也许是这样……喏，一句话，是未来和欢乐的希望，也许在那里我不是外人，不是外国人，我突然非常喜欢耽在祖国。在一个阳光灿烂的早晨我拿起笔，给她写了信；为什么给她写，我不知道。有时候可是很想有个朋友在身边；看来，我是想有个朋友……”公爵沉默了一会，补充说。\n “你恋爱了，是吗？”\n “不。我……我就像给妹妹写信；我落款也是用兄长的名义。”\n “噢，是故意这样做，我明白。”\n “叶莉扎维槽·普罗科菲耶夫娜，回答您这些问题，我感到很不愉快。”\n “我知道你难受，但是你难受不难受丝毫不关我的事。听着，回答我老实话，我像面对上访那样：你在对我撒谎还是没有。”\n “我没有撒谎。”\n “你说没有恋爱，是真的吗？”\n “好像、完全是真的。”\n “瞧你，‘好像！’，是那男孩转交的？”\n “我请求尼古拉·阿尔达利翁诺维奇……”\n “男孩！男孩！”叶莉扎继塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜激动地打断公爵说，“我根本不知道，哪个是尼古拉，·阿尔达利翁诺维奇。是男孩！”\n “是尼古拉·阿尔达利翁诺维奇……”\n “对你说，是男孩！”\n “不，不是男孩，而是尼古拉·阿尔达利翁诺维奇，”最后公爵虽然回答得相当轻松，但是很坚定。\n “算了，好吧，亲爱的，好吧！我给你记住这一点。”\n 她用了１分钟克制自己的激动并休息一下。\n “那么‘可怜的骑士’又是怎么回事？”\n “我根本不知道；这与我无关；是个玩笑罢了。……”\n “这下很高兴知道！只不过，难道她会对你有意思？她自己称你是‘畸形儿，和‘白痴’呢。”\n “您原可以不用对我说这一点的，”公爵含着责备的口气，几乎是低语着指出。\n “别生气。这丫头刚恒任性、疯疯傻傻，娇纵惯了，她要爱上什么人，一定会骂出声来并且当面嘲笑；我也曾经是这样的；只是请别得意，亲爱的，她不属于你的；我不想相信这点，她也永远不会属于你！我对你说是让你马上采取措施。听着，你发誓，你没有跟那一个结婚。”\n “叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜，您怎么啦，哪会呢？”公爵差点惊讶得跳起来。\n “可是差点结了婚？”\n “差点结了婚，”公爵喃喃说着，低下了头。\n “怎么，既然是这样，那么是爱上了她了？现在也是为了她而到这里来的？是为了这个女人吗？”\n “我来不是为了结婚，”公爵回答说。\n “你在世界上有什么神圣的东西？”\n “有的。”\n “你发誓，你不是来跟那个女人结婚的。”\n “随您要我发什么誓都行！”\n “我相信；吻我一下。我终于可以自在地松口气了；但是要知道：阿格拉娅不爱你，采取措施吧，只要我活在世上，她是不会属于你的！听见了吗？”\n “听见了。”\n 公爵脸红得无法正视叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜。\n “牢牢记住。我曾经像期待上帝一样盼着你来（你是不配的，每天夜里泪水都沾湿了枕头，不是为你，亲爱的，不用担心，我有自己别的痛苦，是永恒的永远是那一个痛苦。但是我又为什么迫不及待地盼你来）我仍然相信，上帝亲自把你派来给我作朋友，作亲兄弟的。除了别洛孔斯卡娅老大婆，我身边没有任何人，何况她也飞走了，再加上她年老愚钝，蠢得像头羊。现在你就简单地回答是或不是：你知道吗，前天她为什么要从马车上喊话？”\n “说老实话，我没有参与这件事，我什么都不知道！”\n “够了，我相信。现在我对此有其他的想法，但还是昨天上午我还认为全是叶甫盖尼·帕夫雷奇的过错。前天整整一昼夜和昨天上午都这么想。现在当然不能不同意他们的意见了：很明显，他们把他当傻瓜一样来嘲笑，这里有某种缘由，某种原因，某种目的（就这点令人生疑！而且不成体统！）但是阿格拉娅不会属于他的，” 我对你说明这一点！他纵然是个好人，但是事情就是这样的。我过去动摇过，现在已经打定主意：“先把我放进棺材，埋到地里，然后再嫁女儿吧，，这就是今天上午我对伊万·费奥多罗维奇清清楚楚说的话。你瞧，我是信赖你的，你看到了吧？”\n “我看到了，我明白。”\n 叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜锐利地凝视着公爵；也许，她很想知道，有关叶甫盖尼·帕夫雷奇的消息对他会产生什么样的印象。\n “有关加夫里拉·伊沃尔京的情况你一点也不知道吗？”\n “你指的是……我知道很多。”\n “你是否知道，他与阿格拉娅有联系？”\n “根本不知道，”公爵很惊诧，甚至哆嗦了一下。“怎么，您说，加夫里拉·阿尔达利翁诺维奇与阿梧拉娅有联系？这不可能！”\n “完全是不久前的事。在这里他妹妹整个冬天像老鼠打洞似的为他打通道路。”\n “我不相信，”经过一阵思索和激动之后公爵坚走地重复说，“如果有这样的事，我一定会知道的。”\n “难道他自己会跑来并伏在你胸前流着泪向你承认吗？！哎，你呀，真是个傻瓜，傻瓜！大家都在欺骗你，就像……就像……你信赖他也不觉得害臊？难道你没看到，他整个儿是在骗你？”\n “我清楚地知道，他有时是在欺骗我，”公爵不情愿地低声说，“他也知道，我知道这一点……”他补了一句但没有把话说完。\n “你知道这点，却还信赖他！还有这样荒唐的事！不过你有这种事也是必然的。我有什么好惊奇的呢。天哪！什么时候有过这样的人啊！呸！那你知道吗，这个加尼卡，或者这个瓦里娅，他们替她跟纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜扯上了联系？”\n “替谁？”公爵激动地问。\n “阿格拉娅。”\n “我不相信！不可能有那样的事！是什么目的呢？”\n 他从椅子上跳了起来。\n “虽然有证据，我也不相信。真是个任性惯了的丫头，想入非非的丫头，疯疯癫癫的丫头！可恶的丫头，可恶，可恶！一千年我也要断言，她是个可恶的丫头！她们现在全都这个样，连亚历山德拉这只落汤鸡也不例外，但是这丫头可是跳出了手心。但我也是不相信！也许，是因为不愿意相信，”她仿佛自言自语补了一句，“你为什么不到我家来？”突然她又转向公爵问道，“整整三天为什么不来？”她又一次不耐烦地朝他嚷着。\n 公爵刚开始说明自己的原因，她又打断了他。\n “大家都把你看作是傻瓜并欺骗你！你昨天去过城里了；我敢打赌，你是跪着请求这个无赖接受那一万卢布！”\n “根本不是，也没有想过，我连看也没看到他，此外，他不是无赖。我收到了他的信。”\n “把信拿来看看。”\n 公爵从公文包里拿出便笺，递给叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜。便笺里写道：\n “仁慈的阁下，在人们的眼里，我当然是没有丝毫权利讲自尊的。在世人们看来，我太渺小卑微，谈不上什么自尊。但这是世人的观点，而不是您的看法。我十分确信，仁慈的阁下，您可能比别人好。我不同意多克托连科的观点，在这一信念上我与他有分歧。我永远不会拿您一文钱，您帮助了我的母亲，为此我应该感谢您，虽然这也是因为软弱无能。无论怎样，我是以另一种眼光来看待您的，并且认为有必要告诉您。然后我相信，我们之间不会有任何关系。安季普·布尔多夫斯基。”\n “又及：短缺的二百卢布将在近期内如数奉还。”\n “胡扯一通！？”叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜把便笺扔回给公爵，一边作论说，“不值一谈，你在笑什么？”\n “您会承认，您读了也是感到愉快的。”\n “什么？读这种虚荣心十足的胡扯会感到愉快？难道您没有看见，他们大都狂妄自大、爱面子到疯狂的地步？”\n “是的，但他毕竟认了错，与多克托连科分手了，甚至他越是爱面子，他的这种虚荣心越可贵。噢，您真是个小孩子，叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜。”\n “你最后是想挨我的耳光，还是怎么的？”\n “不，根本不想。而是因为您对便笺感到高兴，却又掩盖这一点。您干吗对您的感情觉得不好意思呢？要知道您在所有方面都这样。”\n “现在不许你走近我一步，”叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜气得脸色发白从座位上跳了起来，“从现在起永远不许你到我那里去！”\n “可是过了三天您自己又会来叫我去……哎、您怎么不羞愧？这是您最好的感情，您何必为此感到不好意思呢？要知道您只是自己折磨自己。”\n “我就是死也不会来叫你，我要忘了你的名字！我已经忘了！”\n 她撇下公爵朝外奔去。\n “不用您吩咐我也已经被禁止去您那儿了！”公爵在她背后喊道。\n “什么？谁禁止你的？”\n 她刹那间转过身来，仿佛用针刺了她似的。公爵犹豫着要不要回答；他觉得，他是无意间说漏了嘴，但是说过头了。\n “谁禁止过你？”叶莉扎维塔·普罗得菲耶夫娜怒不可遏地嚷道。\n “阿格拉娅·伊万诺夫娜禁止的……”\n “什么时候了你倒说呀！”\n “刚才上午她捎信来，永远不许我到你们那儿去。”\n 叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜呆呆地站在那里，但是她在考虑问题。\n “捎的是什么？差遣谁来了？是通过那男孩吗？是口头捎的信？”她突然又大声嚷道。\n “我拿到的是便条，”公爵说。\n “在哪里？拿来！马上！”\n 公爵想了一下，但是还是从背心口袋里掏出了一张很随便的纸片，上面写着：\n “列夫·尼古拉耶维奇公爵！在发生了那一切之后、如果您打算用拜访我们的别墅来使我吃惊，那么请相信，您会发现，我不在高兴者之列。阿格拉娅·叶潘钦娜。”\n 叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜思忖了片刻，然后突然奔向公爵，抓住他的手，拖在自己身后就走。\n “走！现在就去！现在们要去，马上走，”她异常激动和焦躁地喊着。\n “但是要知道您会使我陷于……”\n “陷于什么！真是个天真的傻瓜！你简直就不像个男子汉！嘿，现在我将亲眼见到一切……”\n “至少总得让我抓顶帽子……”\n “喏，你这顶讨厌的帽子，走吧！连挑一顶式样有风度的旧子也不会！……她这是……她这是在刚发生的那件事以后……是一时气急写的，”叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫喃喃着说，一边一刻也不松开公爵的手，拖着他走，“不久前我袒护过你”，我说过你是个傻瓜，因为你不来……否则她不会写这张糊涂的字条！是张有失体面的字条：对一个高贵的，有教养的、非常聪明的姑娘来说是有失体面的！……”她继续说，“嗯，当然她自己也因为你不去而烦恼，只是她没有考虑到、对白痴是不能这样写的，因为他会照字面来理解的，果然就是这样。你干吗偷听？”她豁然明白说漏了嘴，便大喝了一声。“她需要你这样的会逗人开心的人，好久没有见到你了，她这就是来请你！我真高兴，真高兴，她现在将会取笑挖苦你，你就配这样。而她是善于取笑的，啊，她多会取笑人吗！……”\n
