{"id":7425,"no":46,"title":"Part 4 Chapter 8","content":"THIS same morning dawned for the prince pregnant with no less painful presentiments,--which fact his physical state was, of course, quite enough to account for; but he was so indefinably melancholy,--his sadness could not attach itself to anything in particular, and this tormented him more than anything else. Of course certain facts stood before him, clear and painful, but his sadness went beyond all that he could remember or imagine; he realized that he was powerless to console himself unaided. Little by little he began to develop the expectation that this day something important, something decisive, was to happen to him. His attack of yesterday had been a slight one. Excepting some little heaviness in the head and pain in the limbs, he did not feel any particular effects. His brain worked all right, though his soul was heavy within him. He rose late, and immediately upon waking remembered all about the previous evening; he also remembered, though not quite so clearly, how, half an hour after his fit, he had been carried home. He soon heard that a messenger from the Epanchins\u0027 had already been to inquire after him. At half-past eleven another arrived; and this pleased him. Vera Lebedeff was one of the first to come to see him and offer her services. No sooner did she catch sight of him than she burst into tears; but when he tried to soothe her she began to laugh. He was quite struck by the girl\u0027s deep sympathy for him; he seized her hand and kissed it. Vera flushed crimson. \"Oh, don\u0027t, don\u0027t!\" she exclaimed in alarm, snatching her hand away. She went hastily out of the room in a state of strange confusion. Lebedeff also came to see the prince, in a great hurry to get away to the \"deceased,\" as he called General Ivolgin, who was alive still, but very ill. Colia also turned up, and begged the prince for pity\u0027s sake to tell him all he knew about his father which had been concealed from him till now. He said he had found out nearly everything since yesterday; the poor boy was in a state of deep affliction. With all the sympathy which he could bring into play, the prince told Colia the whole story without reserve, detailing the facts as clearly as he could. The tale struck Colia like a thunderbolt. He could not speak. He listened silently, and cried softly to himself the while. The prince perceived that this was an impression which would last for the whole of the boy\u0027s life. He made haste to explain his view of the matter, and pointed out that the old man\u0027s approaching death was probably brought on by horror at the thought of his action; and that it was not everyone who was capable of such a feeling. Colia\u0027s eyes flashed as he listened. \"Gania and Varia and Ptitsin are a worthless lot! I shall not quarrel with them; but from this moment our feet shall not travel the same road. Oh, prince, I have felt much that is quite new to me since yesterday! It is a lesson for me. I shall now consider my mother as entirely my responsibility; though she may be safe enough with Varia. Still, meat and drink is not everything.\" He jumped up and hurried off, remembering suddenly that he was wanted at his father\u0027s bedside; but before he went out of the room he inquired hastily after the prince\u0027s health, and receiving the latter\u0027s reply, added: \"Isn\u0027t there something else, prince? I heard yesterday, but I have no right to talk about this... If you ever want a true friend and servant--neither you nor I are so very happy, are we? --come to me. I won\u0027t ask you questions, though.\" He ran off and left the prince more dejected than ever. Everyone seemed to be speaking prophetically, hinting at some misfortune or sorrow to come; they had all looked at him as though they knew something which he did not know. Lebedeff had asked questions, Colia had hinted, and Vera had shed tears. What was it? At last, with a sigh of annoyance, he said to himself that it was nothing but his own cursed sickly suspicion. His face lighted up with joy when, at about two o\u0027clock, he espied the Epanchins coming along to pay him a short visit, \"just for a minute.\" They really had only come for a minute. Lizabetha Prokofievna had announced, directly after lunch, that they would all take a walk together. The information was given in the form of a command, without explanation, drily and abruptly. All had issued forth in obedience to the mandate; that is, the girls, mamma, and Prince S. Lizabetha Prokofievna went off in a direction exactly contrary to the usual one, and all understood very well what she was driving at, but held their peace, fearing to irritate the good lady. She, as though anxious to avoid any conversation, walked ahead, silent and alone. At last Adelaida remarked that it was no use racing along at such a pace, and that she could not keep up with her mother. \"Look here,\" said Lizabetha Prokofievna, turning round suddenly; \"we are passing his house. Whatever Aglaya may think, and in spite of anything that may happen, he is not a stranger to us; besides which, he is ill and in misfortune. I, for one, shall call in and see him. Let anyone follow me who cares to.\" Of course every one of them followed her. The prince hastened to apologize, very properly, for yesterday\u0027s mishap with the vase, and for the scene generally. \"Oh, that\u0027s nothing,\" replied Lizabetha; \"I\u0027m not sorry for the vase, I\u0027m sorry for you. H\u0027m! so you can see that there was a \u0027scene,\u0027 can you? Well, it doesn\u0027t matter much, for everyone must realize now that it is impossible to be hard on you. Well, au revoir. I advise you to have a walk, and then go to sleep again if you can. Come in as usual, if you feel inclined; and be assured, once for all, whatever happens, and whatever may have happened, you shall always remain the friend of the family--mine, at all events. I can answer for myself.\" In response to this challenge all the others chimed in and re- echoed mamma\u0027s sentiments. And so they took their departure; but in this hasty and kindly designed visit there was hidden a fund of cruelty which Lizabetha Prokofievna never dreamed of. In the words \"as usual,\" and again in her added, \"mine, at all events,\" there seemed an ominous knell of some evil to come. The prince began to think of Aglaya. She had certainly given him a wonderful smile, both at coming and again at leave-taking, but had not said a word, not even when the others all professed their friendship for him. She had looked very intently at him, but that was all. Her face had been paler than usual; she looked as though she had slept badly. The prince made up his mind that he would make a point of going there \"as usual,\" tonight, and looked feverishly at his watch. Vera came in three minutes after the Epanchins had left. \"Lef Nicolaievitch,\" she said, \"Aglaya Ivanovna has just given me a message for you.\" The prince trembled. \"Is it a note?\" \"No, a verbal message; she had hardly time even for that. She begs you earnestly not to go out of the house for a single moment all to-day, until seven o\u0027clock in the evening. It may have been nine; I didn\u0027t quite hear.\" \"But--but, why is this? What does it mean?\" \"I don\u0027t know at all; but she said I was to tell you particularly.\" \"Did she say that?\" \"Not those very words. She only just had time to whisper as she went by; but by the way she looked at me I knew it was important. She looked at me in a way that made my heart stop beating.\" The prince asked a few more questions, and though he learned nothing else, he became more and more agitated. Left alone, he lay down on the sofa, and began to think. \"Perhaps,\" he thought, \"someone is to be with them until nine tonight and she is afraid that I may come and make a fool of myself again, in public.\" So he spent his time longing for the evening and looking at his watch. But the clearing-up of the mystery came long before the evening, and came in the form of a new and agonizing riddle. Half an hour after the Epanchins had gone, Hippolyte arrived, so tired that, almost unconscious, he sank into a chair, and broke into such a fit of coughing that he could not stop. He coughed till the blood came. His eyes glittered, and two red spots on his cheeks grew brighter and brighter. The prince murmured something to him, but Hippolyte only signed that he must be left alone for a while, and sat silent. At last he came to himself. \"I am off,\" he said, hoarsely, and with difficulty. \"Shall I see you home?\" asked the prince, rising from his seat, but suddenly stopping short as he remembered Aglaya\u0027s prohibition against leaving the house. Hippolyte laughed. \"I don\u0027t mean that I am going to leave your house,\" he continued, still gasping and coughing. \"On the contrary, I thought it absolutely necessary to come and see you; otherwise I should not have troubled you. I am off there, you know, and this time I believe, seriously, that I am off! It\u0027s all over. I did not come here for sympathy, believe me. I lay down this morning at ten o\u0027clock with the intention of not rising again before that time; but I thought it over and rose just once more in order to come here; from which you may deduce that I had some reason for wishing to come.\" \"It grieves me to see you so, Hippolyte. Why didn\u0027t you send me a message? I would have come up and saved you this trouble.\" \"Well, well! Enough! You\u0027ve pitied me, and that\u0027s all that good manners exact. I forgot, how are you?\" \"I\u0027m all right; yesterday I was a little--\" \"I know, I heard; the china vase caught it! I\u0027m sorry I wasn\u0027t there. I\u0027ve come about something important. In the first place I had, the pleasure of seeing Gavrila Ardalionovitch and Aglaya Ivanovna enjoying a rendezvous on the green bench in the park. I was astonished to see what a fool a man can look. I remarked upon the fact to Aglaya Ivanovna when he had gone. I don\u0027t think anything ever surprises you, prince!\" added Hippolyte, gazing incredulously at the prince\u0027s calm demeanour. \"To be astonished by nothing is a sign, they say, of a great intellect. In my opinion it would serve equally well as a sign of great foolishness. I am not hinting about you; pardon me! I am very unfortunate today in my expressions. \"I knew yesterday that Gavrila Ardalionovitch--\" began the prince, and paused in evident confusion, though Hippolyte had shown annoyance at his betraying no surprise. \"You knew it? Come, that\u0027s news! But no--perhaps better not tell me. And were you a witness of the meeting?\" \"If you were there yourself you must have known that I was NOT there!\" \"Oh! but you may have been sitting behind the bushes somewhere. However, I am very glad, on your account, of course. I was beginning to be afraid that Mr. Gania--might have the preference!\" \"May I ask you, Hippolyte, not to talk of this subject? And not to use such expressions?\" \"Especially as you know all, eh?\" \"You are wrong. I know scarcely anything, and Aglaya Ivanovna is aware that I know nothing. I knew nothing whatever about this meeting. You say there was a meeting. Very well; let\u0027s leave it so--\" \"Why, what do you mean? You said you knew, and now suddenly you know nothing! You say \u0027very well; let\u0027s leave it so.\u0027 But I say, don\u0027t be so confiding, especially as you know nothing. You are confiding simply BECAUSE you know nothing. But do you know what these good people have in their minds\u0027 eye--Gania and his sister? Perhaps you are suspicious? Well, well, I\u0027ll drop the subject!\" he added, hastily, observing the prince\u0027s impatient gesture. \"But I\u0027ve come to you on my own business; I wish to make you a clear explanation. What a nuisance it is that one cannot die without explanations! I have made such a quantity of them already. Do you wish to hear what I have to say?\" \"Speak away, I am listening.\" \"Very well, but I\u0027ll change my mind, and begin about Gania. Just fancy to begin with, if you can, that I, too, was given an appointment at the green bench today! However, I won\u0027t deceive you; I asked for the appointment. I said I had a secret to disclose. I don\u0027t know whether I came there too early, I think I must have; but scarcely had I sat down beside Aglaya Ivanovna than I saw Gavrila Ardalionovitch and his sister Varia coming along, arm in arm, just as though they were enjoying a morning walk together. Both of them seemed very much astonished, not to say disturbed, at seeing me; they evidently had not expected the pleasure. Aglaya Ivanovna blushed up, and was actually a little confused. I don\u0027t know whether it was merely because I was there, or whether Gania\u0027s beauty was too much for her! But anyway, she turned crimson, and then finished up the business in a very funny manner. She jumped up from her seat, bowed back to Gania, smiled to Varia, and suddenly observed: \u0027I only came here to express my gratitude for all your kind wishes on my behalf, and to say that if I find I need your services, believe me--\u0027 Here she bowed them away, as it were, and they both marched off again, looking very foolish. Gania evidently could not make head nor tail of the matter, and turned as red as a lobster; but Varia understood at once that they must get away as quickly as they could, so she dragged Gania away; she is a great deal cleverer than he is. As for myself, I went there to arrange a meeting to be held between Aglaya Ivanovna and Nastasia Philipovna.\" \"Nastasia Philipovna!\" cried the prince. \"Aha! I think you are growing less cool, my friend, and are beginning to be a trifle surprised, aren\u0027t you? I\u0027m glad that you are not above ordinary human feelings, for once. I\u0027ll console you a little now, after your consternation. See what I get for serving a young and high-souled maiden! This morning I received a slap in the face from the lady!\" \"A--a moral one?\" asked the prince, involuntarily. \"Yes--not a physical one! I don\u0027t suppose anyone--even a woman-- would raise a hand against me now. Even Gania would hesitate! I did think at one time yesterday, that he would fly at me, though. I bet anything that I know what you are thinking of now! You are thinking: \u0027Of course one can\u0027t strike the little wretch, but one could suffocate him with a pillow, or a wet towel, when he is asleep! One OUGHT to get rid of him somehow.\u0027 I can see in your face that you are thinking that at this very second.\" \"I never thought of such a thing for a moment,\" said the prince, with disgust. \"I don\u0027t know--I dreamed last night that I was being suffocated with a wet cloth by--somebody. I\u0027ll tell you who it was--Rogojin! What do you think, can a man be suffocated with a wet cloth?\" \"I don\u0027t know.\" \"I\u0027ve heard so. Well, we\u0027ll leave that question just now. Why am I a scandal-monger? Why did she call me a scandal-monger? And mind, AFTER she had heard every word I had to tell her, and had asked all sorts of questions besides--but such is the way of women. For HER sake I entered into relations with Rogojin--an interesting man! At HER request I arranged a personal interview between herself and Nastasia Philipovna. Could she have been angry because I hinted that she was enjoying Nastasia Philipovna\u0027s \u0027leavings\u0027? Why, I have been impressing it upon her all this while for her own good. Two letters have I written her in that strain, and I began straight off today about its being humiliating for her. Besides, the word \u0027leavings\u0027 is not my invention. At all events, they all used it at Gania\u0027s, and she used it herself. So why am I a scandal-monger? I see--I see you are tremendously amused, at this moment! Probably you are laughing at me and fitting those silly lines to my case-- \"\u0027Maybe sad Love upon his setting smiles, And with vain hopes his farewell hour beguiles. \"Ha, ha, ha!\" Hippolyte suddenly burst into a fit of hysterical laughter, which turned into a choking cough. \"Observe,\" he gasped, through his coughing, \"what a fellow Gania is! He talks about Nastasia\u0027s \u0027leavings,\u0027 but what does he want to take himself?\" The prince sat silent for a long while. His mind was filled with dread and horror. \"You spoke of a meeting with Nastasia Philipovna,\" he said at last, in a low voice. \"Oh--come! Surely you must know that there is to be a meeting today between Nastasia and Aglaya Ivanovna, and that Nastasia has been sent for on purpose, through Rogojin, from St. Petersburg? It has been brought about by invitation of Aglaya Ivanovna and my own efforts, and Nastasia is at this moment with Rogojin, not far from here--at Dana Alexeyevna\u0027s--that curious friend of hers; and to this questionable house Aglaya Ivanovna is to proceed for a friendly chat with Nastasia Philipovna, and for the settlement of several problems. They are going to play at arithmetic--didn\u0027t you know about it? Word of honour?\" \"It\u0027s a most improbable story.\" \"Oh, very well! if it\u0027s improbable--it is--that\u0027s all! And yet-- where should you have heard it? Though I must say, if a fly crosses the room it\u0027s known all over the place here. However, I\u0027ve warned you, and you may be grateful to me. Well--au revoir-- probably in the next world! One more thing--don\u0027t think that I am telling you all this for your sake. Oh, dear, no! Do you know that I dedicated my confession to Aglaya Ivanovna? I did though, and how she took it, ha, ha! Oh, no! I am not acting from any high, exalted motives. But though I may have behaved like a cad to you, I have not done HER any harm. I don\u0027t apologize for my words about \u0027leavings\u0027 and all that. I am atoning for that, you see, by telling you the place and time of the meeting. Goodbye! You had better take your measures, if you are worthy the name of a man! The meeting is fixed for this evening--that\u0027s certain.\" Hippolyte walked towards the door, but the prince called him back and he stopped. \"Then you think Aglaya Ivanovna herself intends to go to Nastasia Philipovna\u0027s tonight?\" he asked, and bright hectic spots came out on his cheeks and forehead. \"I don\u0027t know absolutely for certain; but in all probability it is so,\" replied Hippolyte, looking round. \"Nastasia would hardly go to her; and they can\u0027t meet at Gania\u0027s, with a man nearly dead in the house.\" \"It\u0027s impossible, for that very reason,\" said the prince. \"How would she get out if she wished to? You don\u0027t know the habits of that house--she COULD not get away alone to Nastasia Philipovna\u0027s! It\u0027s all nonsense!\" \"Look here, my dear prince, no one jumps out of the window if they can help it; but when there\u0027s a fire, the dandiest gentleman or the finest lady in the world will skip out! When the moment comes, and there\u0027s nothing else to be done--our young lady will go to Nastasia Philipovna\u0027s! Don\u0027t they let the young ladies out of the house alone, then?\" \"I didn\u0027t mean that exactly.\" There was no reason for the prince to set anyone to watch, even if he had been capable of such a thing. Aglaya\u0027s command that he should stay at home all day seemed almost explained now. Perhaps she meant to call for him, herself, or it might be, of course, that she was anxious to make sure of his not coming there, and therefore bade him remain at home. His head whirled; the whole room seemed to be turning round. He lay down on the sofa, and closed his eyes. One way or the other the question was to be decided at last-- finally. Oh, no, he did not think of Aglaya as a boarding-school miss, or a young lady of the conventional type! He had long since feared that she might take some such step as this. But why did she wish to see Nastasia? He shivered all over as he lay; he was in high fever again. No! he did not account her a child. Certain of her looks, certain of her words, of late, had filled him with apprehension. At times it had struck him that she was putting too great a restraint upon herself, and he remembered that he had been alarmed to observe this. He had tried, all these days, to drive away the heavy thoughts that oppressed him; but what was the hidden mystery of that soul? The question had long tormented him, although he implicitly trusted that soul. And now it was all to be cleared up. It was a dreadful thought. And \"that woman\" again! Why did he always feel as though \"that woman\" were fated to appear at each critical moment of his life, and tear the thread of his destiny like a bit of rotten string? That he always HAD felt this he was ready to swear, although he was half delirious at the moment. If he had tried to forget her, all this time, it was simply because he was afraid of her. Did he love the woman or hate her? This question he did not once ask himself today; his heart was quite pure. He knew whom he loved. He was not so much afraid of this meeting, nor of its strangeness, nor of any reasons there might be for it, unknown to himself; he was afraid of the woman herself, Nastasia Philipovna. He remembered, some days afterwards, how during all those fevered hours he had seen but HER eyes, HER look, had heard HER voice, strange words of hers; he remembered that this was so, although he could not recollect the details of his thoughts. He could remember that Vera brought him some dinner, and that he took it; but whether he slept after dinner, or no, he could not recollect. He only knew that he began to distinguish things clearly from the moment when Aglaya suddenly appeared, and he jumped up from the sofa and went to meet her. It was just a quarter past seven then. Aglaya was quite alone, and dressed, apparently hastily, in a light mantle. Her face was pale, as it had been in the morning, and her eyes were ablaze with bright but subdued fire. He had never seen that expression in her eyes before. She gazed attentively at him. \"You are quite ready, I observe,\" she said, with absolute composure, \"dressed, and your hat in your hand. I see somebody has thought fit to warn you, and I know who. Hippolyte?\" \"Yes, he told me,\" said the prince, feeling only half alive. \"Come then. You know, I suppose, that you must escort me there? You are well enough to go out, aren\u0027t you?\" \"I am well enough; but is it really possible?--\" He broke off abruptly, and could not add another word. This was his one attempt to stop the mad child, and, after he had made it, he followed her as though he had no will of his own. Confused as his thoughts were, he was, nevertheless, capable of realizing the fact that if he did not go with her, she would go alone, and so he must go with her at all hazards. He guessed the strength of her determination; it was beyond him to check it. They walked silently, and said scarcely a word all the way. He only noticed that she seemed to know the road very well; and once, when he thought it better to go by a certain lane, and remarked to her that it would be quieter and less public, she only said, \"it\u0027s all the same,\" and went on. When they were almost arrived at Daria Alexeyevna\u0027s house (it was a large wooden structure of ancient date), a gorgeously-dressed lady and a young girl came out of it. Both these ladies took their seats in a carriage, which was waiting at the door, talking and laughing loudly the while, and drove away without appearing to notice the approaching couple. No sooner had the carriage driven off than the door opened once more; and Rogojin, who had apparently been awaiting them, let them in and closed it after them. \"There is not another soul in the house now excepting our four selves,\" he said aloud, looking at the prince in a strange way. Nastasia Philipovna was waiting for them in the first room they went into. She was dressed very simply, in black. She rose at their entrance, but did not smile or give her hand, even to the prince. Her anxious eyes were fixed upon Aglaya. Both sat down, at a little distance from one another--Aglaya on the sofa, in the corner of the room, Nastasia by the window. The prince and Rogojin remained standing, and were not invited to sit. Muishkin glanced at Rogojin in perplexity, but the latter only smiled disagreeably, and said nothing. The silence continued for some few moments. An ominous expression passed over Nastasia Philipovna\u0027s face, of a sudden. It became obstinate-looking, hard, and full of hatred; but she did not take her eyes off her visitors for a moment. Aglaya was clearly confused, but not frightened. On entering she had merely glanced momentarily at her rival, and then had sat still, with her eyes on the ground, apparently in thought. Once or twice she glanced casually round the room. A shade of disgust was visible in her expression; she looked as though she were afraid of contamination in this place. She mechanically arranged her dress, and fidgeted uncomfortably, eventually changing her seat to the other end of the sofa. Probably she was unconscious of her own movements; but this very unconsciousness added to the offensiveness of their suggested meaning. At length she looked straight into Nastasia\u0027s eyes, and instantly read all there was to read in her rival\u0027s expression. Woman understood woman! Aglaya shuddered. \"You know of course why I requested this meeting?\" she said at last, quietly, and pausing twice in the delivery of this very short sentence. \"No--I know nothing about it,\" said Nastasia, drily and abruptly. Aglaya blushed. Perhaps it struck her as very strange and impossible that she should really be sitting here and waiting for \"that woman\u0027s\" reply to her question. At the first sound of Nastasia\u0027s voice a shudder ran through her frame. Of course \"that woman\" observed and took in all this. \"You know quite well, but you are pretending to be ignorant,\" said Aglaya, very low, with her eyes on the ground. \"Why should I?\" asked Nastasia Philipovna, smiling slightly. \"You want to take advantage of my position, now that I am in your house,\" continued Aglaya, awkwardly. \"For that position YOU are to blame and not I,\" said Nastasia, flaring up suddenly. \"_I_ did not invite YOU, but you me; and to this moment I am quite ignorant as to why I am thus honoured.\" Aglaya raised her head haughtily. \"Restrain your tongue!\" she said. \"I did not come here to fight you with your own weapons. \"Oh! then you did come \u0027to fight,\u0027 I may conclude? Dear me!--and I thought you were cleverer--\" They looked at one another with undisguised malice. One of these women had written to the other, so lately, such letters as we have seen; and it all was dispersed at their first meeting. Yet it appeared that not one of the four persons in the room considered this in any degree strange. The prince who, up to yesterday, would not have believed that he could even dream of such an impossible scene as this, stood and listened and looked on, and felt as though he had long foreseen it all. The most fantastic dream seemed suddenly to have been metamorphosed into the most vivid reality. One of these women so despised the other, and so longed to express her contempt for her (perhaps she had only come for that very purpose, as Rogojin said next day), that howsoever fantastical was the other woman, howsoever afflicted her spirit and disturbed her understanding, no preconceived idea of hers could possibly stand up against that deadly feminine contempt of her rival. The prince felt sure that Nastasia would say nothing about the letters herself; but he could judge by her flashing eyes and the expression of her face what the thought of those letters must be costing her at this moment. He would have given half his life to prevent Aglaya from speaking of them. But Aglaya suddenly braced herself up, and seemed to master herself fully, all in an instant. \"You have not quite understood,\" she said. \"I did not come to quarrel with you, though I do not like you. I came to speak to you as... as one human being to another. I came with my mind made up as to what I had to say to you, and I shall not change my intention, although you may misunderstand me. So much the worse for you, not for myself! I wished to reply to all you have written to me and to reply personally, because I think that is the more convenient way. Listen to my reply to all your letters. I began to be sorry for Prince Lef Nicolaievitch on the very day I made his acquaintance, and when I heard--afterwards--of all that took place at your house in the evening, I was sorry for him because he was such a simple-minded man, and because he, in the simplicity of his soul, believed that he could be happy with a woman of your character. What I feared actually took place; you could not love him, you tortured him, and threw him over. You could not love him because you are too proud--no, not proud, that is an error; because you are too vain--no, not quite that either; too self-loving; you are self-loving to madness. Your letters to me are a proof of it. You could not love so simple a soul as his, and perhaps in your heart you despised him and laughed at him. All you could love was your shame and the perpetual thought that you were disgraced and insulted. If you were less shameful, or had no cause at all for shame, you would be still more unhappy than you are now. Aglaya brought out these thronging words with great satisfaction. They came from her lips hurriedly and impetuously, and had been prepared and thought out long ago, even before she had ever dreamed of the present meeting. She watched with eagerness the effect of her speech as shown in Nastasia\u0027s face, which was distorted with agitation. \"You remember,\" she continued, \"he wrote me a letter at that time; he says you know all about that letter and that you even read it. I understand all by means of this letter, and understand it correctly. He has since confirmed it all to me--what I now say to you, word for word. After receiving his letter I waited; I guessed that you would soon come back here, because you could never do without Petersburg; you are still too young and lovely for the provinces. However, this is not my own idea,\" she added, blushing dreadfully; and from this moment the colour never left her cheeks to the end of her speech. When I next saw the prince I began to feel terribly pained and hurt on his account. Do not laugh; if you laugh you are unworthy of understanding what I say.\" \"Surely you see that I am not laughing,\" said Nastasia, sadly and sternly. \"However, it\u0027s all the same to me; laugh or not, just as you please. When I asked him about you, he told me that he had long since ceased to love you, that the very recollection of you was a torture to him, but that he was sorry for you; and that when he thought of you his heart was pierced. I ought to tell you that I never in my life met a man anything like him for noble simplicity of mind and for boundless trustfulness. I guessed that anyone who liked could deceive him, and that he would immediately forgive anyone who did deceive him; and it was for this that I grew to love him--\" Aglaya paused for a moment, as though suddenly brought up in astonishment that she could have said these words, but at the same time a great pride shone in her eyes, like a defiant assertion that it would not matter to her if \"this woman\" laughed in her face for the admission just made. \"I have told you all now, and of course you understand what I wish of you.\" \"Perhaps I do; but tell me yourself,\" said Nastasia Philipovna, quietly. Aglaya flushed up angrily. \"I wished to find out from you,\" she said, firmly, \"by what right you dare to meddle with his feelings for me? By what right you dared send me those letters? By what right do you continually remind both me and him that you love him, after you yourself threw him over and ran away from him in so insulting and shameful a way?\" \"I never told either him or you that I loved him!\" replied Nastasia Philipovna, with an effort. \"And--and I did run away from him--you are right there,\" she added, scarcely audibly. \"Never told either him or me?\" cried Aglaya. \"How about your letters? Who asked you to try to persuade me to marry him? Was not that a declaration from you? Why do you force yourself upon us in this way? I confess I thought at first that you were anxious to arouse an aversion for him in my heart by your meddling, in order that I might give him up; and it was only afterwards that I guessed the truth. You imagined that you were doing an heroic action! How could you spare any love for him, when you love your own vanity to such an extent? Why could you not simply go away from here, instead of writing me those absurd letters? Why do you not NOW marry that generous man who loves you, and has done you the honour of offering you his hand? It is plain enough why; if you marry Rogojin you lose your grievance; you will have nothing more to complain of. You will be receiving too much honour. Evgenie Pavlovitch was saying the other day that you had read too many poems and are too well educated for--your position; and that you live in idleness. Add to this your vanity, and, there you have reason enough--\" \"And do you not live in idleness?\" Things had come to this unexpected point too quickly. Unexpected because Nastasia Philipovna, on her way to Pavlofsk, had thought and considered a good deal, and had expected something different, though perhaps not altogether good, from this interview; but Aglaya had been carried away by her own outburst, just as a rolling stone gathers impetus as it careers downhill, and could not restrain herself in the satisfaction of revenge. It was strange, Nastasia Philipovna felt, to see Aglaya like this. She gazed at her, and could hardly believe her eyes and ears for a moment or two. Whether she were a woman who had read too many poems, as Evgenie Pavlovitch supposed, or whether she were mad, as the prince had assured Aglaya, at all events, this was a woman who, in spite of her occasionally cynical and audacious manner, was far more refined and trustful and sensitive than appeared. There was a certain amount of romantic dreaminess and caprice in her, but with the fantastic was mingled much that was strong and deep. The prince realized this, and great suffering expressed itself in his face. Aglaya observed it, and trembled with anger. \"How dare you speak so to me?\" she said, with a haughtiness which was quite indescribable, replying to Nastasia\u0027s last remark. \"You must have misunderstood what I said,\" said Nastasia, in some surprise. \"If you wished to preserve your good name, why did you not give up your--your \u0027guardian,\u0027 Totski, without all that theatrical posturing?\" said Aglaya, suddenly a propos of nothing. \"What do you know of my position, that you dare to judge me?\" cried Nastasia, quivering with rage, and growing terribly white. \"I know this much, that you did not go out to honest work, but went away with a rich man, Rogojin, in order to pose as a fallen angel. I don\u0027t wonder that Totski was nearly driven to suicide by such a fallen angel.\" \"Silence!\" cried Nastasia Philipovna. \"You are about as fit to understand me as the housemaid here, who bore witness against her lover in court the other day. She would understand me better than you do.\" \"Probably an honest girl living by her own toil. Why do you speak of a housemaid so contemptuously?\" \"I do not despise toil; I despise you when you speak of toil.\" \"If you had cared to be an honest woman, you would have gone out as a laundress.\" Both had risen, and were gazing at one another with pallid faces. \"Aglaya, don\u0027t! This is unfair,\" cried the prince, deeply distressed. Rogojin was not smiling now; he sat and listened with folded arms, and lips tight compressed. \"There, look at her,\" cried Nastasia, trembling with passion. \"Look at this young lady! And I imagined her an angel! Did you come to me without your governess, Aglaya Ivanovna? Oh, fie, now shall I just tell you why you came here today? Shall I tell you without any embellishments? You came because you were afraid of me!\" \"Afraid of YOU?\" asked Aglaya, beside herself with naive amazement that the other should dare talk to her like this. \"Yes, me, of course! Of course you were afraid of me, or you would not have decided to come. You cannot despise one you fear. And to think that I have actually esteemed you up to this very moment! Do you know why you are afraid of me, and what is your object now? You wished to satisfy yourself with your own eyes as to which he loves best, myself or you, because you are fearfully jealous.\" \"He has told me already that he hates you,\" murmured Aglaya, scarcely audibly. \"Perhaps, perhaps! I am not worthy of him, I know. But I think you are lying, all the same. He cannot hate me, and he cannot have said so. I am ready to forgive you, in consideration of your position; but I confess I thought better of you. I thought you were wiser, and more beautiful, too; I did, indeed! Well, take your treasure! See, he is gazing at you, he can\u0027t recollect himself. Take him, but on one condition; go away at once, this instant!\" She fell back into a chair, and burst into tears. But suddenly some new expression blazed in her eyes. She stared fixedly at Aglaya, and rose from her seat. \"Or would you like me to bid him, BID HIM, do you hear, COMMAND HIM, now, at once, to throw you up, and remain mine for ever? Shall I? He will stay, and he will marry me too, and you shall trot home all alone. Shall I?--shall I say the word?\" she screamed like a madwoman, scarcely believing herself that she could really pronounce such wild words. Aglaya had made for the door in terror, but she stopped at the threshold, and listened. \"Shall I turn Rogojin off? Ha! ha! you thought I would marry him for your benefit, did you? Why, I\u0027ll call out NOW, if you like, in your presence, \u0027Rogojin, get out!\u0027 and say to the prince, \u0027Do you remember what you promised me?\u0027 Heavens! what a fool I have been to humiliate myself before them! Why, prince, you yourself gave me your word that you would marry me whatever happened, and would never abandon me. You said you loved me and would forgive me all, and--and resp--yes, you even said that! I only ran away from you in order to set you free, and now I don\u0027t care to let you go again. Why does she treat me so-- so shamefully? I am not a loose woman--ask Rogojin there! He\u0027ll tell you. Will you go again now that she has insulted me, before your eyes, too; turn away from me and lead her away, arm-in-arm? May you be accursed too, for you were the only one I trusted among them all! Go away, Rogojin, I don\u0027t want you,\" she continued, blind with fury, and forcing the words out with dry lips and distorted features, evidently not believing a single word of her own tirade, but, at the same time, doing her utmost to prolong the moment of self-deception. The outburst was so terribly violent that the prince thought it would have killed her. \"There he is!\" she shrieked again, pointing to the prince and addressing Aglaya. \"There he is! and if he does not approach me at once and take ME and throw you over, then have him for your own--I give him up to you! I don\u0027t want him!\" Both she and Aglaya stood and waited as though in expectation, and both looked at the prince like madwomen. But he, perhaps, did not understand the full force of this challenge; in fact, it is certain he did not. All he could see was the poor despairing face which, as he had said to Aglaya, \"had pierced his heart for ever.\" He could bear it no longer, and with a look of entreaty, mingled with reproach, he addressed Aglaya, pointing to Nastasia the while: \"How can you?\" he murmured; \"she is so unhappy.\" But he had no time to say another word before. Aglaya\u0027s terrible look bereft him of speech. In that look was embodied so dreadful a suffering and so deadly a hatred, that he gave a cry and flew to her; but it was too late. She could not hold out long enough even to witness his movement in her direction. She had hidden her face in her hands, cried once \" Oh, my God!\" and rushed out of the room. Rogojin followed her to undo the bolts of the door and let her out into the street. The prince made a rush after her, but he, was caught and held back. The distorted, livid face of Nastasia gazed at him reproachfully, and her blue lips whispered: \"What? Would you go to her--to her?\" She fell senseless into his arms. He raised her, carried her into the room, placed her in an arm- chair, and stood over her, stupefied. On the table stood a tumbler of water. Rogojin, who now returned, took this and sprinkled a little in her face. She opened her eyes, but for a moment she understood nothing. Suddenly she looked around, shuddered, gave a loud cry, and threw herself in the prince\u0027s arms. \"Mine, mine!\" she cried. \"Has the proud young lady gone? Ha, ha, ha!\" she laughed hysterically. \"And I had given him up to her! Why--why did I? Mad--mad! Get away, Rogojin! Ha, ha, ha!\" Rogojin stared intently at them; then he took his hat, and without a word, left the room. A few moments later, the prince was seated by Nastasia on the sofa, gazing into her eyes and stroking her face and hair, as he would a little child\u0027s. He laughed when she laughed, and was ready to cry when she cried. He did not speak, but listened to her excited, disconnected chatter, hardly understanding a word of it the while. No sooner did he detect the slightest appearance of complaining, or weeping, or reproaching, than he would smile at her kindly, and begin stroking her hair and her cheeks, soothing and consoling her once more, as if she were a child. 对于公爵来说这个早晨是在沉重的预感的影响下开始的；这些预感可以用他的病态来解释，但是他莫名的忧伤太深了，这对他来说是最痛苦不过了。确实，呈现在他面前的是鲜明的、沉重的和令人难受的事实，但是他的忧郁远胜于他所能想起和想象到的一切。他明白，他一个人是无法使自己平静的。渐渐地在他心中滋生出一种期待，今天他一定会发生什么特别的，决定性的事。昨天他发病是属轻的发作，除了忧郁，头脑有些发沉和肢体疼痛外，他没有觉得有任何别的不舒服。他的头脑相当清晰，尽管心灵是痛苦的。他很迟才起床，马上就明白地想起了昨天的晚会；虽然并不完全清楚，但毕竟想起了在他发病后过了半小时把他送回了家。他获悉，叶潘钦家已经差人到他这儿来过，探询他的身体状况，１点半又差人来过；这使他感到很高兴，最早来探望和侍候他的人中还有维拉·列别杰娃，最初她一看见他便突然哭了起来，但是当公爵立即使她平静下来后，她便开怀大笑了，这个姑娘对他的强烈同情不知怎么的突然使他很是吃惊。他抓起她的手吻了一下。维拉脸上一下子飞起红晕。 “啊，您这是干什么，您这是干什么！”她惊惧地喊了起来，急忙抽回了自己的手。 她在一种奇怪的窘态中很快就离去了，不过她告诉了公爵，她父亲今天天刚亮就跑到被他称为“死者”的将军那里去了，想了解夜间他是否死了，听人家说大概快要死了。１１点多，列别杰夫自己到公爵家里来，但是，说实在的，“只来一会儿，了解一下贵体如何”等等，此外也是为了光顾一下“小酒柜”。除了唉声叹气，他什么事也没有，因此公爵便让他快走了，但是他毕竟还是试着打听了一下昨天发病的情况，虽然看得出，他对此事已经知道得颇为详尽了。在他后面来的是科利亚，也是一会儿；他确实很仓促，强烈地惶恐不安和阴沉忧郁。他一开始就直截了当和坚决地请求公爵把对他隐瞒的一切情况讲清楚，并且说昨天他已经差不多全知道了。他被强烈而深深地震惊了。 公爵尽自己所能以极大的同情叙述了整个事情的来龙去脉，十分确凿地叙述了事实，可怜的男孩如遭五雷轰顶，惊呆了，他一句话也说不出来，默默地哭了起来。公爵觉得，这样的印象是会永远留在记忆中的，并将成为这个少年一生中的转折点。他急忙向他表达了自己对事情的看法，并补充说，在他看来，老人的死也许主要是因为犯了这样的过错以后留在他心间的恐惧造成的，并不是所有的人都能有这种感觉的，科利亚听完公爵的活，眼睛炯炯有光。 “不中用的加尼卡，瓦里娅和普季岑！我不会跟他们吵架，但是从此刻起我与他们各走各的路！啊，公爵，从昨天起我感知了许多新东西；这是我的教训！我认为现在母亲也应由我来赡养，虽然她在瓦里娅那里也是有保障的，但这毕竟不是办法……” 他想起家里正在等他，便跳起身，匆匆问了一下公爵的身体状况，听完回答后，突然急急地补充说： “有没有别的什么情况？我听说昨天……（不过，我没有权利知道），但是，如果什么时候和什么地方用得着忠实的仆人，那么这个仆人就在您面前。好像我们俩都不怎么走远，是这样吗？但是……我不问了，不问了……” 他走了，而公爵更陷于沉思中：大家都在预言将有不幸，大家已经做了结论，大家都在望着，似乎他们知道着什么他所不知道的事情。列别杰夫向他探询，科利亚直接在暗示，维拉则哭泣，最后，他懊丧地挥了一下手：“该死的疑心病！”他这么想。１点多钟时，当他看见叶潘钦家的人进来探望他，“待一会儿”，这时他的脸色才开朗起来。这些人确实是来一会儿。叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜用过早餐后站起身后宣布，大家现在去散步，大家一起去。这一通知是以命令的形式下达时，简短生硬、刻板冷淡，不加说明。大家走了出来，也就是妈妈，三位小姐，ω公爵，叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜径直朝每天走的相反方向走去。大家都明白是怎么回事，也都不吭声，怕惹恼了妈妈，而她象是要躲避指责和反对似的，头也不回地走在大家前面。阿杰莱达终于说，散步用不着走这么快，叫人都赶不上妈妈。 “听着，”突然叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜转过身来说，“现在我们就要从他门前经过。无论阿格拉娅怎么想，也不论以后会发生什么情况，他对我们来说不是陌生人，加上现在他又在不幸之中，而且有病在身，至少我是要去看他的，谁愿意跟我去的就去，谁不愿意的一”就从旁边经过，没人挡路。” 自然大家都进去了。公爵理所当然地急于为昨天打碎了花瓶和……出丑再次请求原谅。 “算了，这没有什么，”叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜回答说，“花瓶倒不可惜，可惜的是你。看来，现在你自己也承认是出丑了：‘第二天早晨……到底不一样，但是这也没关系，因为所有的人现在都看见了，对你是不好追究什么的。不过，好了，再见了，如果体力能行，就散一会步，然后再睡觉，这是我的忠告，如果你忽然想要来，还像过去那样来吧；你要永远相信，不论发生过什么事，不论出了什么事，你仍然是我家的朋友，至少是我的朋友。起码我能力自己担保……” 大家都对这一提议做出了反应，表示他们和妈妈的感情是一样的，他们说了这些亲切的鼓励话后就走了，在这种不加掩饰的仓促中隐藏着连叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜自己也没有意识到的许多冷酷的东西。在“像过去那佯”来的邀请中，在“至少是我的朋友”这句话中，又流露出某种预示。公爵开始回想阿格拉娅的态度，确实，在她进来和告别时，她都曾令人惊讶地对他嫣然一笑，但是她没有说一句话，甚至在人家表白对他的友情时，她也没有开口，虽然有两次凝神朝他看了一眼。她的脸色比平时苍白，仿佛她夜里睡得不好，公爵决定“像过去一样”晚上”一定到他们家去，并且焦躁地看了一下表。叶潘钦家的人走后过了３分钟，维拉走了进来。 “列夫·尼古拉耶维奇，阿格拉娅·伊万诺夫娜刚才悄悄地让我转告您一句话。” 公爵不禁打起颤来。 “是便条？” “不是，是口头说的；连这也勉强来得及说。她十分请求您今天一整天一刻也不要出去，直到晚上７点或者甚至是９点，我当时听得不太清楚。” “可是……这样做是为什么呢？这是什么意思呢？” “我一点也不知道，只是嘱咐一定得转告。” “她真是这么说‘一定’？” “没有，她没直接说，因为就一转身的功夫，她刚来得及说完话，幸亏我自己跑近前去。但是从脸上看得出来，就像命令似的询问，是否一定转告。她望着我的样子，使我心都屏息不跳了……” 又问了几个问题，虽然公爵再也没有了解到更多的情况，然而他却更加惶惶不安起来。剩下他一人时，他躺到沙发上，又开始思忖，“也许，谁将在他们家，要耽到９点，而她又在为我担心，别在客人面前又闹出什么事来。”他最后想通了，于是又开始不耐烦地等着晚上降临和不时地看表，但是随之而来的谜底比晚上来得早得多。谜底也是通过新的来访揭开的，谜底又伴随着折磨人的新谜：叶潘钦家的人走后半小时，伊波利特到他这儿来。他疲惫不堪，走进来一句话也不说，像失去知觉似地一头倒到圈椅里，一刹时陷入难以忍受的剧咳之中。直至咳出血来。他目光闪闪发亮，两颊升起红晕。公爵对他低声说了些什么，但是他没有作答，而且好久都不回话，只是不停地摆手，要别人暂时别打扰他。最后他才恢复过来。 “我要走。”终于他用沙哑的噪子勉强说道。 “您愿意的话，我送您到家，”公爵从座位上欠起身说，但又停住了，因为想起刚才不许他走出家门的禁令。 伊波利特笑了起来。 “我不是从您这里走，”他不停地喘气和痉咳着说，“相反，我认为有必要到您这儿来，有事情……否则就不会来打扰了。我要到那里去了，这一次好像是真格的了。完蛋了！我不是为了得到同情，请相信……今天我从，１０点钟起就已经躺下了。已经根本不打算再起来了，直到那个时候，但是又改变了主意，又起来了，到您这儿来……看来，是有此必要的。” “瞧您这副样子真可怜；您该差人来叫我，总比自己挣扎着来好。” “好了，够了。您表示了怜惜，也就是说，对于上流社会的礼仪来说也足够了……对了，我忘了问，您身体怎样？” “我很好，昨天曾经……不太……” “我听说了，听说了。中国花瓶倒了霉。遗憾的是我不在！我到您这儿来有事。首先，今天我有幸见到加夫里拉。阿尔达利翁诺维奇跟阿格拉娅·伊万诺夫娜在约会，在绿色长椅那儿。使我惊讶的是，一个人的傻样可以达到何等地步。在加夫里拉·阿尔达利翁诺维奇走开以后我向阿格拉娅·伊万诺夫娜本人指出了这一点……您好像丝毫也不感到惊奇，公爵，”他不信任地望着公爵平睁的脸，补充说，“据说，对什么都不觉得惊奇是大智的表现，据我看，这同样地也可以是大愚的表现……不过，我不是影射您，对不起……今天我用语表达很不顺当。” “还是在昨天我就知道加夫里拉·阿尔达利翁诺维奇……”公爵停住不说了，显然他是不好意思再说了，因为伊被利特就那样也已经为他并不惊讶而感到懊丧了。 “您已经知道了！这真是新闻！不过，看来还是别讲吧……那您今天有没有见到他们的约会？” “既然您自己在那里，您不看见了，我没在场。” “算了，也许您是瞩在什么地方的扈木丛后面。不过，无论如何我很高兴，自然是为您高兴，不然我以为，加夫里拉·阿尔达利翁诺维奇得到了青睐！” “我请您别跟我谈这件事，伊波利特，别用这样的词语。” “因为您已经全部知道了。” “您错了，我几乎什么也不知道，而且阿格拉娅·伊万诺夫娜也一定知道，我一无所知，我甚至连这约会也丝毫未闻……您说一曾经有过约会？算了，好吧，我们不谈这个……” “这是怎么回事，一会儿知道，一会儿又不知道了。您说：‘好了，我们不谈这个？’嘿，不，您别这么轻信！要是您不知道，您就尤其要这样。您之所以轻信，就因为您不知道。您是否知道这兄妹俩有什么盘算？也许，您在怀疑这一点？……好，好，我不说……”他注意到公爵不耐烦的手势，补充说，“但我来是为了自己的事，我想对这件事……做个解释。真见鬼，无论如何不能不做解释就死去，我现在要讲的话多得不得了，您愿意听完吗。” “说吧，我听着。” “不过，我又改变主意了：我还是从加尼奇卡说起吧，您能想象到吗，今天也约我到绿色长椅那儿去。不过，我不想撒谎：是我自己坚决要求约会的，我再三要求，许诺要揭示一个秘密，我不知道，我到得是否太早（好像，确实是早到了），但我刚刚在阿格拉娅·伊万诺夫娜身旁坐下，我便看到加夫里拉·阿尔达利翁诺维奇和瓦尔瓦拉·阿尔达利翁诺夫娜出现了，他们俩挽着手，像是散步似的。两人遇见我，似乎非常吃惊；他们没有料到我在，甚至显得很局促不安。阿格拉娅·伊万诺夫娜一下子脸涨得绯红，信不信由您，她甚至有点不知所措，是由于我在场呢，还是就只是由于看见了加夫里拉·阿尔达利翁诺维奇，因为他实在太漂亮了，但她仅仅是满脸通红，一秒钟内她就了结了事情，很可笑：她欠了欠身作为对加夫里拉·阿尔达利翁诺维奇的鞠躬和对瓦尔瓦拉·阿尔达利翁诺夫娜献媚的微笑的答礼，接着一下子断然说：‘我只是为了向你们表示，对你们的真挚友好的感情我个人感到欣慰，如果将来我需要这种感情，那么请相信……’说到这里她避开了，他们俩也就走了，我不知道，他们是稀里糊涂呢，还是洋洋得意。加尼奇卡当然是稀里糊涂，他什么也辨不出来，脸红得象只虾（他脸上的表情有时令人惊讶），但瓦尔瓦拉· 阿尔达利翁诺夫娜似乎明白了，应该尽快走开，再说从阿格拉娅·伊万诺夫娜嘴里说出这样的话已经足够了，她就拖开了兄长。她比他聪明，我深信，现在他正得意呢，而我去是要跟阿格拉娅·伊万诺夫娜谈一谈，商量与纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜见面的事。” “跟纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜！”公爵喊了起来。 “啊哈！看来，您失去冷静，开始惊讶了。我很高兴看到，您愿意像一个常人那样，为此我要让您开开心。今天我挨了她一记耳光，这就是为高贵心灵的年轻小姐效劳的结果！” “精神上的耳光。”公爵有点不由自主的问道。 “是的，不是肉体上的，我觉得，无论是谁都抬不起手来打我这样的人，即使是女人现在也不会打，甚至加尼亚也不会打！虽然昨天我一度这样想过，以为他会向我猛扑过来……我敢打赌，我知道您现在在想什么？您在想：‘假定说，打他是不应该，但可以乘他睡着时用枕头或湿抹布把他闷死，甚至是应该这样做的’……您的脸上写着，此刻您想的是这个。” “我从来都没有这样想过！”公爵厌恶地说。 “我不知道，今天夜里我做了个梦，梦见一个人……用湿抹布闷死了我……好了，我告诉您是准：您想象一下一”是罗戈任！您认为，用湿抹布能闷死人吗。” “我不知道。” “我听说是能闷死人的。好，我们不谈这个。嘿，凭什么我是个搬弄是非的人？凭什么她今天骂我是搬弄是非的人？请注意，那已经是在她听完了最后一句话并且还重问了一些问题后说的……但女人就是这样的！为了她我才与罗戈任有来往，这倒是个有意思的人；为了她的利益我才为她安排与纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜的个人约会。莫非是因为我影射她乐于受用纳斯培西娅·费利帕夫娜的‘残羹剩饭’，伤了她的自尊心？其实我一直对她讲这个道理也是为了她的利益，我不抵赖，我给她写过两封这类内容的信，今天是第三次，是会面……刚才我是这样开始对她说的，我认为这对她来说是有损尊严的……再说‘残羹剩饭’这个字眼也不是我自己想出来的，是别人说的，至少加尼奇卡家里大家都这么说；她自己也是承认的。嘿，那又为什么她要骂我是搬弄是非的人？我看出来了，看出来了，您现在望着我，这副样子可笑极了，我敢打赌，您正在用两句愚蠢的诗句来比我： 也许，在我哀伤的临终时刻， 爱情将会闪露出告别的微笑。 “哈－哈－哈……突然他发出一阵歇斯底里的笑声并且咳嗽起来。“请注意，”他夹着咳嗽嘶哑地说，“加尼奇卡是什么东西；是他说的‘残羹剩饭”，可现在自己倒想受用！” 公爵好久都没有说话，他惊骇不已。 “您说的是与纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜会面。”他终于喃喃说。 “哎，难道您真的不知道，今天阿洛拉娅·伊万诺夫娜将与纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜会面。为此纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜特地从彼得堡来，是阿格拉娅·伊万诺夫娜通过罗戈任邀请的，再加上我的斡旋，现在她与罗戈任一起住在离您完全不远的地方，还是过去那幢房子，在达里娅·阿列克谢耶夫娜那里……这是她的女友，一位身份颇为可疑的太太。阿格拉娅·伊万诺夫娜今天就要到这家可疑的人家去跟纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜进行一场友好的谈后来解决各种问题。她们想算算明白事理。您不知道吗？您这是实话？” “这难以置信！” “既然难以置信，那就算了，好吧；不过您又从哪儿知道这不可信呢？可信呢？在这里哪怕飞过一只苍蝇，也就已经众所周知了：这个小地方就是这样的！但是我已经预先通知过您了，我可以得到您的感激了，好了，再见——大概要在阴间了。还有一件事：我虽然对您做了卑鄙的事，因为……我何必要失去自己想要的东西呢？请想想，是为了使您得到好处吗，要知道我的《自白》是献给她的（您不知道这点吗？）而且她是怎么接受的呀！嘻－嘻！但是我对她没有做过卑鄙的事，我没有任何对不起她的地方；她却羞辱了我，使我陷入窘境……不过，我也丝毫没有对不起您；要说刚才提到‘残羹剩饭’这类话，那么现在我已告诉您会面的日子，钟点和地址，揭开了整个这场游戏的秘密……当然，是出了烦恼，而不是大变。告辞了，我，作为一个结已的人和肺病患者，真是太饶舌了；看看点，采取措施吧，要尽快，如果您配得上称作人的话。会面是在今天晚上，这是确切的。” 伊波利特朝门口走去，但公爵喊了他一声，于是他在门口停下了。 “这么说，阿格拉娅·伊万诺夫娜照您说的，今天要亲自去见纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜？”公爵问。他的脸颊上、额头上现出了红晕。 “确切的我也不知道，但是想必是这样，”伊波利特半回过头来作答，“不过也不可能是别的。总不见得纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜到她哪儿去吧：再说也不是在加尼奇卡那里；他那里几乎有个死人躺着。将军情况怎么样了？” “光凭这一点就不可能！”公爵附和说，“即使阿格拉娅·伊万诺夫娜愿意，她又怎么走得出来？您不知道……这家人家的规矩：她不能一个人去纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜那儿；这是荒唐的！” “要知道，公爵：好端端谁也不会从窗户里跳出来，可是一发生火灾，那么，大概最上流的绅士和最上流的女士也会从窗户里跳出来的，如果有必要，又没有别的办法，我们的小姐就","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/256/2411.html","bookId":242,"book":{"id":242,"title":"白痴 The
