{"id":7427,"no":48,"title":"Part 4 Chapter 10","content":"THE prince did not die before his wedding--either by day or night, as he had foretold that he might. Very probably he passed disturbed nights, and was afflicted with bad dreams; but, during the daytime, among his fellow-men, he seemed as kind as ever, and even contented; only a little thoughtful when alone. The wedding was hurried on. The day was fixed for exactly a week after Evgenie\u0027s visit to the prince. In the face of such haste as this, even the prince\u0027s best friends (if he had had any) would have felt the hopelessness of any attempt to save\" the poor madman.\" Rumour said that in the visit of Evgenie Pavlovitch was to be discerned the influence of Lizabetha Prokofievna and her husband... But if those good souls, in the boundless kindness of their hearts, were desirous of saving the eccentric young fellow from ruin, they were unable to take any stronger measures to attain that end. Neither their position, nor their private inclination, perhaps (and only naturally), would allow them to use any more pronounced means. We have observed before that even some of the prince\u0027s nearest neighbours had begun to oppose him. Vera Lebedeff\u0027s passive disagreement was limited to the shedding of a few solitary tears; to more frequent sitting alone at home, and to a diminished frequency in her visits to the prince\u0027s apartments. Colia was occupied with his father at this time. The old man died during a second stroke, which took place just eight days after the first. The prince showed great sympathy in the grief of the family, and during the first days of their mourning he was at the house a great deal with Nina Alexandrovna. He went to the funeral, and it was observable that the public assembled in church greeted his arrival and departure with whisperings, and watched him closely. The same thing happened in the park and in the street, wherever he went. He was pointed out when he drove by, and he often overheard the name of Nastasia Philipovna coupled with his own as he passed. People looked out for her at the funeral, too, but she was not there; and another conspicuous absentee was the captain\u0027s widow, whom Lebedeff had prevented from coming. The funeral service produced a great effect on the prince. He whispered to Lebedeff that this was the first time he had ever heard a Russian funeral service since he was a little boy. Observing that he was looking about him uneasily, Lebedeff asked him whom he was seeking. \"Nothing. I only thought I--\" \"Is it Rogojin?\" \"Why--is he here?\" \"Yes, he\u0027s in church.\" \"I thought I caught sight of his eyes!\" muttered the prince, in confusion. \"But what of it!--Why is he here? Was he asked?\" \"Oh, dear, no! Why, they don\u0027t even know him! Anyone can come in, you know. Why do you look so amazed? I often meet him; I\u0027ve seen him at least four times, here at Pavlofsk, within the last week.\" \"I haven\u0027t seen him once--since that day!\" the prince murmured. As Nastasia Philipovna had not said a word about having met Rogojin since \"that day,\" the prince concluded that the latter had his own reasons for wishing to keep out of sight. All the day of the funeral our hero, was in a deeply thoughtful state, while Nastasia Philipovna was particularly merry, both in the daytime and in the evening. Colia had made it up with the prince before his father\u0027s death, and it was he who urged him to make use of Keller and Burdovsky, promising to answer himself for the former\u0027s behaviour. Nina Alexandrovna and Lebedeff tried to persuade him to have the wedding in St. Petersburg, instead of in the public fashion contemplated, down here at Pavlofsk in the height of the season. But the prince only said that Nastasia Philipovna desired to have it so, though he saw well enough what prompted their arguments. The next day Keller came to visit the prince. He was in a high state of delight with the post of honour assigned to him at the wedding. Before entering he stopped on the threshold, raised his hand as if making a solemn vow, and cried: \"I won\u0027t drink!\" Then he went up to the prince, seized both his hands, shook them warmly, and declared that he had at first felt hostile towards the project of this marriage, and had openly said so in the billiard-rooms, but that the reason simply was that, with the impatience of a friend, he had hoped to see the prince marry at least a Princess de Rohan or de Chabot; but that now he saw that the prince\u0027s way of thinking was ten times more noble than that of \"all the rest put together.\" For he desired neither pomp nor wealth nor honour, but only the truth! The sympathies of exalted personages were well known, and the prince was too highly placed by his education, and so on, not to be in some sense an exalted personage! \"But all the common herd judge \u0027differently; in the town, at the meetings, in the villas, at the band, in the inns and the billiard-rooms, the coming event has only to be mentioned and there are shouts and cries from everybody. I have even heard talk of getting up a \u0027charivari\u0027 under the windows on the wedding- night. So if \u0027you have need of the pistol\u0027 of an honest man, prince, I am ready to fire half a dozen shots even before you rise from your nuptial couch!\" Keller also advised, in anticipation of the crowd making a rush after the ceremony, that a fire-hose should be placed at the entrance to the house; but Lebedeff was opposed to this measure, which he said might result in the place being pulled down. \"I assure you, prince, that Lebedeff is intriguing against you. He wants to put you under control. Imagine that! To take \u0027from you the use of your free-will and your money--that\u0027 is to say, the two things that distinguish us from the animals! I have heard it said positively. It is the sober truth.\" The prince recollected that somebody had told him something of the kind before, and he had, of course, scoffed at it. He only laughed now, and forgot the hint at once. Lebedeff really had been busy for some little while; but, as usual, his plans had become too complex to succeed, through sheer excess of ardour. When he came to the prince--the very day before the wedding--to confess (for he always confessed to the persons against whom he intrigued, especially when the plan failed), he informed our hero that he himself was a born Talleyrand, but for some unknown reason had become simple Lebedeff. He then proceeded to explain his whole game to the prince, interesting the latter exceedingly. According to Lebedeff\u0027s account, he had first tried what he could do with General Epanchin. The latter informed him that he wished well to the unfortunate young man, and would gladly do what he could to \"save him,\" but that he did not think it would be seemly for him to interfere in this matter. Lizabetha Prokofievna would neither hear nor see him. Prince S. and Evgenie Pavlovitch only shrugged their shoulders, and implied that it was no business of theirs. However, Lebedeff had not lost heart, and went off to a clever lawyer,--a worthy and respectable man, whom he knew well. This old gentleman informed him that the thing was perfectly feasible if he could get hold of competent witnesses as to Muishkin\u0027s mental incapacity. Then, with the assistance of a few influential persons, he would soon see the matter arranged. Lebedeff immediately procured the services of an old doctor, and carried the latter away to Pavlofsk to see the prince, by way of viewing the ground, as it were, and to give him (Lebedeff) counsel as to whether the thing was to be done or not. The visit was not to be official, but merely friendly. Muishkin remembered the doctor\u0027s visit quite well. He remembered that Lebedeff had said that he looked ill, and had better see a doctor; and although the prince scouted the idea, Lebedeff had turned up almost immediately with his old friend, explaining that they had just met at the bedside of Hippolyte, who was very ill, and that the doctor had something to tell the prince about the sick man. The prince had, of course, at once received him, and had plunged into a conversation about Hippolyte. He had given the doctor an account of Hippolyte\u0027s attempted suicide; and had proceeded thereafter to talk of his own malady,--of Switzerland, of Schneider, and so on; and so deeply was the old man interested by the prince\u0027s conversation and his description of Schneider\u0027s system, that he sat on for two hours. Muishkin gave him excellent cigars to smoke, and Lebedeff, for his part, regaled him with liqueurs, brought in by Vera, to whom the doctor--a married man and the father of a family--addressed such compliments that she was filled with indignation. They parted friends, and, after leaving the prince, the doctor said to Lebedeff: \"If all such people were put under restraint, there would be no one left for keepers.\" Lebedeff then, in tragic tones, told of the approaching marriage, whereupon the other nodded his head and replied that, after all, marriages like that were not so rare; that he had heard that the lady was very fascinating and of extraordinary beauty, which was enough to explain the infatuation of a wealthy man; that, further, thanks to the liberality of Totski and of Rogojin, she possessed--so he had heard--not only money, but pearls, diamonds, shawls, and furniture, and consequently she could not be considered a bad match. In brief, it seemed to the doctor that the prince\u0027s choice, far from being a sign of foolishness, denoted, on the contrary, a shrewd, calculating, and practical mind. Lebedeff had been much struck by this point of view, and he terminated his confession by assuring the prince that he was ready, if need be, to shed his very life\u0027s blood for him. Hippolyte, too, was a source of some distraction to the prince at this time; he would send for him at any and every hour of the day. They lived,--Hippolyte and his mother and the children,--in a small house not far off, and the little ones were happy, if only because they were able to escape from the invalid into the garden. The prince had enough to do in keeping the peace between the irritable Hippolyte and his mother, and eventually the former became so malicious and sarcastic on the subject of the approaching wedding, that Muishkin took offence at last, and refused to continue his visits. A couple of days later, however, Hippolyte\u0027s mother came with tears in her eyes, and begged the prince to come back, \"or HE would eat her up bodily.\" She added that Hippolyte had a great secret to disclose. Of course the prince went. There was no secret, however, unless we reckon certain pantings and agitated glances around (probably all put on) as the invalid begged his visitor to \"beware of Rogojin.\" \"He is the sort of man,\" he continued,. \"who won\u0027t give up his object, you know; he is not like you and me, prince--he belongs to quite a different order of beings. If he sets his heart on a thing he won\u0027t be afraid of anything--\" and so on. Hippolyte was very ill, and looked as though he could not long survive. He was tearful at first, but grew more and more sarcastic and malicious as the interview proceeded. The prince questioned him in detail as to his hints about Rogojin. He was anxious to seize upon some facts which might confirm Hippolyte\u0027s vague warnings; but there were none; only Hippolyte\u0027s own private impressions and feelings. However, the invalid--to his immense satisfaction--ended by seriously alarming the prince. At first Muishkin had not cared to make any reply to his sundry questions, and only smiled in response to Hippolyte\u0027s advice to \"run for his life--abroad, if necessary. There are Russian priests everywhere, and one can get married all over the world.\" But it was Hippolyte\u0027s last idea which upset him. \"What I am really alarmed about, though,\" he said, \"is Aglaya Ivanovna. Rogojin knows how you love her. Love for love. You took Nastasia Philipovna from him. He will murder Aglaya Ivanovna; for though she is not yours, of course, now, still such an act would pain you,--wouldn\u0027t it?\" He had attained his end. The prince left the house beside himself with terror. These warnings about Rogojin were expressed on the day before the wedding. That evening the prince saw Nastasia Philipovna for the last time before they were to meet at the altar; but Nastasia was not in a position to give him any comfort or consolation. On the contrary, she only added to his mental perturbation as the evening went on. Up to this time she had invariably done her best to cheer him--she was afraid of his looking melancholy; she would try singing to him, and telling him every sort of funny story or reminiscence that she could recall. The prince nearly always pretended to be amused, whether he were so actually or no; but often enough he laughed sincerely, delighted by the brilliancy of her wit when she was carried away by her narrative, as she very often was. Nastasia would be wild with joy to see the impression she had made, and to hear his laugh of real amusement; and she would remain the whole evening in a state of pride and happiness. But this evening her melancholy and thoughtfulness grew with every hour. The prince had told Evgenie Pavlovitch with perfect sincerity that he loved Nastasia Philipovna with all his soul. In his love for her there was the sort of tenderness one feels for a sick, unhappy child which cannot be left alone. He never spoke of his feelings for Nastasia to anyone, not even to herself. When they were together they never discussed their \"feelings,\" and there was nothing in their cheerful, animated conversation which an outsider could not have heard. Daria Alexeyevna, with whom Nastasia was staying, told afterwards how she had been filled with joy and delight only to look at them, all this time. Thanks to the manner in which he regarded Nastasia\u0027s mental and moral condition, the prince was to some extent freed from other perplexities. She was now quite different from the woman he had known three months before. He was not astonished, for instance, to see her now so impatient to marry him--she who formerly had wept with rage and hurled curses and reproaches at him if he mentioned marriage! \"It shows that she no longer fears, as she did then, that she would make me unhappy by marrying me,\" he thought. And he felt sure that so sudden a change could not be a natural one. This rapid growth of self-confidence could not be due only to her hatred for Aglaya. To suppose that would be to suspect the depth of her feelings. Nor could it arise from dread of the fate that awaited her if she married Rogojin. These causes, indeed, as well as others, might have played a part in it, but the true reason, Muishkin decided, was the one he had long suspected--that the poor sick soul had come to the end of its forces. Yet this was an explanation that did not procure him any peace of mind. At times he seemed to be making violent efforts to think of nothing, and one would have said that he looked on his marriage as an unimportant formality, and on his future happiness as a thing not worth considering. As to conversations such as the one held with Evgenie Pavlovitch, he avoided them as far as possible, feeling that there were certain objections to which he could make no answer. The prince had observed that Nastasia knew well enough what Aglaya was to him. He never spoke of it, but he had seen her face when she had caught him starting off for the Epanchins\u0027 house on several occasions. When the Epanchins left Pavlofsk, she had beamed with radiance and happiness. Unsuspicious and unobservant as he was, he had feared at that time that Nastasia might have some scheme in her mind for a scene or scandal which would drive Aglaya out of Pavlofsk. She had encouraged the rumours and excitement among the inhabitants of the place as to her marriage with the prince, in order to annoy her rival; and, finding it difficult to meet the Epanchins anywhere, she had, on one occasion, taken him for a drive past their house. He did not observe what was happening until they were almost passing the windows, when it was too late to do anything. He said nothing, but for two days afterwards he was ill. Nastasia did not try that particular experiment again. A few days before that fixed for the wedding, she grew grave and thoughtful. She always ended by getting the better of her melancholy, and becoming merry and cheerful again, but not quite so unaffectedly happy as she had been some days earlier. The prince redoubled his attentive study of her symptoms. It was a most curious circumstance, in his opinion, that she never spoke of Rogojin. But once, about five days before the wedding, when the prince was at home, a messenger arrived begging him to come at once, as Nastasia Philipovna was very ill. He had found her in a condition approaching to absolute madness. She screamed, and trembled, and cried out that Rogojin was hiding out there in the garden--that she had seen him herself--and that he would murder her in the night--that he would cut her throat. She was terribly agitated all day. But it so happened that the prince called at Hippolyte\u0027s house later on, and heard from his mother that she had been in town all day, and had there received a visit from Rogojin, who had made inquiries about Pavlofsk. On inquiry, it turned out that Rogojin visited the old lady in town at almost the same moment when Nastasia declared that she had seen him in the garden; so that the whole thing turned out to be an illusion on her part. Nastasia immediately went across to Hippolyte\u0027s to inquire more accurately, and returned immensely relieved and comforted. On the day before the wedding, the prince left Nastasia in a state of great animation. Her wedding-dress and all sorts of finery had just arrived from town. Muishkin had not imagined that she would be so excited over it, but he praised everything, and his praise rendered her doubly happy. But Nastasia could not hide the cause of her intense interest in her wedding splendour. She had heard of the indignation in the town, and knew that some of the populace was getting up a sort of charivari with music, that verses had been composed for the occasion, and that the rest of Pavlofsk society more or less encouraged these preparations. So, since attempts were being made to humiliate her, she wanted to hold her head even higher than usual, and to overwhelm them all with the beauty and taste of her toilette. \"Let them shout and whistle, if they dare!\" Her eyes flashed at the thought. But, underneath this, she had another motive, of which she did not speak. She thought that possibly Aglaya, or at any rate someone sent by her, would be present incognito at the ceremony, or in the crowd, and she wished to be prepared for this eventuality. The prince left her at eleven, full of these thoughts, and went home. But it was not twelve o\u0027clock when a messenger came to say that Nastasia was very bad, and he must come at once. The prince was a whole hour soothing and comforting her, and left her, at length, pacified and composed. He sent another messenger during the night to inquire after her, and two more next morning. The last brought back a message that Nastasia was surrounded by a whole army of dressmakers and maids, and was as happy and as busy as such a beauty should be on her wedding morning, and that there was not a vestige of yesterday\u0027s agitation remaining. The message concluded with the news that at the moment of the bearer\u0027s departure there was a great confabulation in progress as to which diamonds were to be worn, and how. This message entirely calmed the prince\u0027s mind. The following report of the proceedings on the wedding day may be depended upon, as coming from eye-witnesses. The wedding was fixed for eight o\u0027clock in the evening. Nastasia Philipovna was ready at seven. From six o\u0027clock groups of people began to gather at Nastasia\u0027s house, at the prince\u0027s, and at the church door, but more especially at the former place. The church began to fill at seven. Colia and Vera Lebedeff were very anxious on the prince\u0027s account, but they were so busy over the arrangements for receiving the guests after the wedding, that they had not much time for the indulgence of personal feelings. There were to be very few guests besides the best men and so on; only Dana Alexeyevna, the Ptitsins, Gania, and the doctor. When the prince asked Lebedeff why he had invited the doctor, who was almost a stranger, Lebedeff replied: \"Why, he wears an \u0027order,\u0027 and it looks so well!\" This idea amused the prince. Keller and Burdovsky looked wonderfully correct in their dress- coats and white kid gloves, although Keller caused the bridegroom some alarm by his undisguisedly hostile glances at the gathering crowd of sight-seers outside. At about half-past seven the prince started for the church in his carriage. We may remark here that he seemed anxious not to omit a single one of the recognized customs and traditions observed at weddings. He wished all to be done as openly as possible, and \"in due order.\" Arrived at the church, Muishkin, under Keller\u0027s guidance, passed through the crowd of spectators, amid continuous whispering and excited exclamations. The prince stayed near the altar, while Keller made off once more to fetch the bride. On reaching the gate of Daria Alexeyevna\u0027s house, Keller found a far denser crowd than he had encountered at the prince\u0027s. The remarks and exclamations of the spectators here were of so irritating a nature that Keller was very near making them a speech on the impropriety of their conduct, but was luckily caught by Burdovsky, in the act of turning to address them, and hurried indoors. Nastasia Philipovna was ready. She rose from her seat, looked into the glass and remarked, as Keller told the tale afterwards, that she was \"as pale as a corpse.\" She then bent her head reverently, before the ikon in the corner, and left the room. A torrent of voices greeted her appearance at the front door. The crowd whistled, clapped its hands, and laughed and shouted; but in a moment or two isolated voices were distinguishable. \"What a beauty!\" cried one. \"Well, she isn\u0027t the first in the world, nor the last,\" said another. \"Marriage covers everything,\" observed a third. \"I defy you to find another beauty like that,\" said a fourth. \"She\u0027s a real princess! I\u0027d sell my soul for such a princess as that!\" Nastasia came out of the house looking as white as any handkerchief; but her large dark eyes shone upon the vulgar crowd like blazing coals. The spectators\u0027 cries were redoubled, and became more exultant and triumphant every moment. The door of the carriage was open, and Keller had given his hand to the bride to help her in, when suddenly with a loud cry she rushed from him, straight into the surging crowd. Her friends about her were stupefied with amazement; the crowd parted as she rushed through it, and suddenly, at a distance of five or six yards from the carriage, appeared Rogojin. It was his look that had caught her eyes. Nastasia rushed to him like a madwoman, and seized both his hands. \"Save me!\" she cried. \"Take me away, anywhere you like, quick!\" Rogojin seized her in his arms and almost carried her to the carriage. Then, in a flash, he tore a hundred-rouble note out of his pocket and held it to the coachman. \"To the station, quick! If you catch the train you shall have another. Quick!\" He leaped into the carriage after Nastasia and banged the door. The coachman did not hesitate a moment; he whipped up the horses, and they were oft. \"One more second and I should have stopped him,\" said Keller, afterwards. In fact, he and Burdovsky jumped into another carriage and set off in pursuit; but it struck them as they drove along that it was not much use trying to bring Nastasia back by force. \"Besides,\" said Burdovsky,\" the prince would not like it, would he?\" So they gave up the pursuit. Rogojin and Nastasia Philipovna reached the station just in time for the train. As he jumped out of the carriage and was almost on the point of entering the train, Rogojin accosted a young girl standing on the platform and wearing an old-fashioned, but respectable-looking, black cloak and a silk handkerchief over her head. \"Take fifty roubles for your cloak?\" he shouted, holding the money out to the girl. Before the astonished young woman could collect her scattered senses, he pushed the money into her hand, seized the mantle, and threw it and the handkerchief over Nastasia\u0027s head and shoulders. The latter\u0027s wedding-array would have attracted too much attention, and it was not until some time later that the girl understood why her old cloak and kerchief had been bought at such a price. The news of what had happened reached the church with extraordinary rapidity. When Keller arrived, a host of people whom he did not know thronged around to ask him questions. There was much excited talking, and shaking of heads, even some laughter; but no one left the church, all being anxious to observe how the now celebrated bridegroom would take the news. He grew very pale upon hearing it, but took it quite quietly. \"I was afraid,\" he muttered, scarcely audibly, \"but I hardly thought it would come to this.\" Then after a short silence, he added: \"However, in her state, it is quite consistent with the natural order of things.\" Even Keller admitted afterwards that this was \"extraordinarily philosophical\" on the prince\u0027s part. He left the church quite calm, to all appearances, as many witnesses were found to declare afterwards. He seemed anxious to reach home and be left alone as quickly as possible; but this was not to be. He was accompanied by nearly all the invited guests, and besides this, the house was almost besieged by excited bands of people, who insisted upon being allowed to enter the verandah. The prince heard Keller and Lebedeff remonstrating and quarrelling with these unknown individuals, and soon went out himself. He approached the disturbers of his peace, requested courteously to be told what was desired; then politely putting Lebedeff and Keller aside, he addressed an old gentleman who was standing on the verandah steps at the head of the band of would-be guests, and courteously requested him to honour him with a visit. The old fellow was quite taken aback by this, but entered, followed by a few more, who tried to appear at their ease. The rest remained outside, and presently the whole crowd was censuring those who had accepted the invitation. The prince offered seats to his strange visitors, tea was served, and a general conversation sprang up. Everything was done most decorously, to the considerable surprise of the intruders. A few tentative attempts were made to turn the conversation to the events of the day, and a few indiscreet questions were asked; but Muishkin replied to everybody with such simplicity and good-humour, and at the same time with so much dignity, and showed such confidence in the good breeding of his guests, that the indiscreet talkers were quickly silenced. By degrees the conversation became almost serious. One gentleman suddenly exclaimed, with great vehemence: \"Whatever happens, I shall not sell my property; I shall wait. Enterprise is better than money, and there, sir, you have my whole system of economy, if you wish!\" He addressed the prince, who warmly commended his sentiments, though Lebedeff whispered in his ear that this gentleman, who talked so much of his \"property,\" had never had either house or home. Nearly an hour passed thus, and when tea was over the visitors seemed to think that it was time to go. As they went out, the doctor and the old gentleman bade Muishkin a warm farewell, and all the rest took their leave with hearty protestations of good- will, dropping remarks to the effect that \"it was no use worrying,\" and that \"perhaps all would turn out for the best,\" and so on. Some of the younger intruders would have asked for champagne, but they were checked by the older ones. When all had departed, Keller leaned over to Lebedeff, and said: \"With you and me there would have been a scene. We should have shouted and fought, and called in the police. But he has simply made some new friends--and such friends, too! I know them!\" Lebedeff, who was slightly intoxicated, answered with a sigh: \"Things are hidden from the wise and prudent, and revealed unto babes. I have applied those words to him before, but now I add that God has preserved the babe himself from the abyss, He and all His saints.\" At last, about half-past ten, the prince was left alone. His head ached. Colia was the last to go, after having helped him to change his wedding clothes. They parted on affectionate terms, and, without speaking of what had happened, Colia promised to come very early the next day. He said later that the prince had given no hint of his intentions when they said good-bye, but had hidden them even from him. Soon there was hardly anyone left in the house. Burdovsky had gone to see Hippolyte; Keller and Lebedeff had wandered off together somewhere. Only Vera Lebedeff remained hurriedly rearranging the furniture in the rooms. As she left the verandah, she glanced at the prince. He was seated at the table, with both elbows upon it, and his head resting on his hands. She approached him, and touched his shoulder gently. The prince started and looked at her in perplexity; he seemed to be collecting his senses for a minute or so, before he could remember where he was. As recollection dawned upon him, he became violently agitated. All he did, however, was to ask Vera very earnestly to knock at his door and awake him in time for the first train to Petersburg next morning. Vera promised, and the prince entreated her not to tell anyone of his intention. She promised this, too; and at last, when she had half-closed the door, be called her back a third time, took her hands in his, kissed them, then kissed her forehead, and in a rather peculiar manner said to her, \"Until tomorrow!\" Such was Vera\u0027s story afterwards. She went away in great anxiety about him, but when she saw him in the morning, he seemed to be quite himself again, greeted her with a smile, and told her that he would very likely be back by the evening. It appears that he did not consider it necessary to inform anyone excepting Vera of his departure for town. 然而，直至结婚公爵既没有在清醒时也没有像他对叶甫盖尼·帕夫洛维奇预言的那样“在梦中”死去。也许，他确实睡得不好，做了恶梦；但是在白天跟人们在一起时他显得十分慈和，甚至颇为满意，只是有时候思虑重重，但这通常是一个人的时候。婚礼在加紧准备着，将在叶甫盖尼·帕夫洛维奇来访后过一个星期左右举行，在这么急促的情况下即使是公爵最好的朋友（如果他有这样的朋友）也必然会对他们企图“拯救”不幸的痴子的努力感到失望。有传闻说，叶甫盖尼·帕夫洛维奇的拜访部分是伊万·费奥多罗维奇将军和他的夫人叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜出的主意。但是，如果出于无限的好心他们俩愿意挽救这可怜的痴子脱离深渊，那么，当然，他们也只能限于这种浅微的尝试；无论是他们的处境，甚至无论是他们的心境（这是很自然的）都不适于做出更大的努力。我们已经提到过，甚至公爵周围的人也在一定程度上反对他。不过维拉·列别杰娃只是独自洒泪，还有她坐在自己屋子里的时间多，比过去少去看公爵了。科利亚这段时间里办了父亲的丧事；老头死于第二天中风，这是在第一次中风后过了八天以后发生的。公爵对他们家的痛苦表示极大同情，最初几天在尼娜·亚历山德罗夫娜那儿常常几小时地陪着；他也参加了葬礼教堂里的仪式。许多人注意到了，在教堂里的人们不满地窃窃私语着迎送着公爵；在街上和花园里也是这样：当他走过或者坐车经过的时候，便响起了窃窃私语，提到他的名字，指指戳戳，还听到纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜的名字：人们在葬礼上还寻找她，但她没有参加葬礼。大尉夫人也没有出席葬礼，列别杰夫总算及时制止了她去。安魂弥撤仪式给公爵留下了强烈的痛苦的印象；还在教堂里的时候，他回答列别杰夫的什么问题，对他低语道，他第一次出席东正教的安魂弥撒，只记得童年时在乡村教堂里参加过另一种安魂弥撒。 “是啊，就像不是那个人躺在棺村里，还完全是不久前我们还请他坐在主席位置上，记得吗？”列别杰夫对公爵轻轻说道，“您在找谁？” “没什么，我觉得……” “是罗戈任吗？” “难道他在这里。” “在教堂里。” “怪不得我仿佛觉得有他的一双眼睛，”公爵惶惑地说，“这算什么……他为什么来？是邀请的？” “根本就没有想过要邀请他。他可完全与死者不相识。这里各种各样人都有，是公共场所嘛。您干嘛这么惊讶？我现在常常遇见他；最近这个星期里，在帕夫洛夫斯克这里，我已经遇到他四次了。” “从那时起……我一次还没有见过他，”公爵喃喃说。 因为纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜还一次也没有告诉过他，从那时起遇到过罗戈任，所以公爵现在得出结论，罗戈任不知为什么故意不露面。这一整天他陷于深深的沉思之中；纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜那天白天和晚上都非常快活。 科利亚在父母去世前就与公爵取得了和解，他提议邀请凯勒尔和布尔多夫斯基当傧相（因为事情很迫切，已刻不容缓）。他为凯勒尔担保，说他会举止得体，也许还“很中用”，至于布尔多夫斯基就没什么好说的，这是安静谦和的人。尼娜·亚历山德罗夫娜和列别杰夫向公爵指出，既然已决定举行婚礼，至少何必在帕夫洛夫斯克办事，而且还在人们来别墅消夏的旺季，何必要如此声张？在彼得堡甚至在家里不是更好吗？公爵对于没有这些疑俱的意思是十分明了的；但他回答得简单扼要，纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜的意愿一定要这样办。第二天凯勒尔未见公爵，他已被告知当傧相。的事，在进来之前，他停在门口，一见公爵便举起右手，弯曲着食指，像发誓似地喊着： “我不喝酒！” 然后他走到公爵面前，紧紧地握着和抖动着他的双手，声称道，一开始当他听说公爵要结婚的事时，当然，他曾经是反对者，并且在打弹子时还宣布过这一点，不是什么别的原因，而是因为他为公爵认定了；并且怀着朋友的焦急心情每天都等待着看见在他身后的人应无异于德罗安公主这样的人，但现在他亲眼看到，公爵所想的比他们所有人“加在一起”想的至少要高尚十二倍：因为他需要的不是显赫，不是财产，甚至也不是声望，而只是真理！高贵的人物的好恶太为众人所知了，而公爵不当高贵的人，说真的，他的教养太高尚了。“但是混蛋和各种各样的小人却不是这样看问题；在城里，在家里，在会议上，在别墅里，“在音乐会上，在酒铺里，在弹子房里就只是关于即将举行婚礼的闲言碎语、喧哗嚷闹。我听说，有些人甚至想在窗下起哄生事。而且是在所谓新婚之夜！公爵，如果您用得着一个忠诚的人的手枪，那么，我准备用掉它半打高尚的子弹，让您第二天早上安然从喜床上起来。”他担心从教堂出来时会涌来大批渴望见到新人的人，因此建议在院子里准备好水龙带；但列别杰夫表示反对，“用水龙带会把房子彻底冲垮。” “这个列别杰夫在对您耍诡计，公爵，真的！他们想把您置于官方保护之下，您能想象到这点吗，还连同您的一切，您的自由和金钱，也就是我们每个人区分于四足动物的两样东西！我听说了，真的听说了！这是干真万确的！” 公爵记起来，似乎他自己也听到过这一类话，但是，他自然没有加以注意。就是现在他也只是放声大笑一阵，便就忘了。列别杰夫确实忙碌了一阵子；这个人打的主意总仿佛是灵机一动产生出来的，由于过分急切而使事情变得复杂，节外生枝，离开了原先的出发点而向四面八方岔开去；这就是为什么他一生中很少有什么取得成功。后来，几乎已经是举行婚礼那一天，他来向公爵表示悔过（他有一个始终不变的习惯，总是会向被他算计过的人忏悔，尤其是未能得逞的情况下这样做），他声称，他天生是个塔列兰＊，可是不知怎么搞的他仍然只是列别杰夫，接着他向公爵但白了全部把戏，还使公爵产生莫大的兴趣。用他的话来说，他是从寻找高层人物的保护开始的，以便在必要的时候可以依靠他们，于是他就去找伊万·费奥多罗维奇将军：伊万·费奥多罗维奇将军甚为困感，他很希望“年轻人”好，但是他宣布：“即使有挽救的愿望，这种事上他不便采取行动。”莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜则既不想听他也不想看见他；叶甫盖尼·帕夫洛维奇和ω公爵只是连连挥手。但是列别杰夫他并没有气馁，跟一个瘦律师商量，这是个受人尊敬的老头，他的好朋友。“这几乎是恩人”，那人做出结论说此事完来可能办到。“只要有智力失常和精神障碍的权威性证明”与此同时，主要要有高层人士的保护。列别杰夫没有沮丧，马上在有一天甚至带了医生来见公爵。这也是一位德高望重的老头，来住别墅消夏的，脖子上还挂一枚安娜勋章。带他来的唯一目的据说是为了看看地方，认识一下公爵以及暂时是非正式地而是所谓友好地告知有关他健康的结论意见。公爵记起了大夫对他的这次拜访；他记得，列别杰夫还在上一天就缠着他，说他身体不好、在公爵坚决拒绝医治的情况下，他突然与一位大夫一起来了，推托说他们俩刚从捷连季耶夫先生那儿来，他情况很槽，大夫有话要对公爵讲讲病人的情况。公爵称赞了列别杰夫，并十分高兴地接待了大夫。马上他们就伊波利特的病交谈起来。大夫请求详细讲一下当时自杀的情景，公爵对事件的叙述和解释完全吸引住了大夫。他们还谈起了彼得堡的气候，公爵本人的病，还谈到了瑞士，施奈德。公蛋叙述的施奈德用的治疗体系和各种故事使大夫产生浓厚的兴趣，以致耽了二个小时；与此同时还抽了公爵的上好的雪茄，而列别杰夫则有维拉送来的可口饮料。大夫是个有妻室和家庭的人，竟对维拉说起特别的恭维话来，惹得她深为气忿。他们分手时已成为朋友，从公爵家出来后，大夫告诉列别杰夫，如果所有这样的人都要置于保护之下，那么该让谁来当保护人呢，对于列别杰夫悲痛地叙述的迫在眉睫的事，大夫狡黠和诡诈地摇摇头，最后指出，不用说“随便什么人都要跟人结婚”，“这个迷人的女人有着非凡的美貌，光是这一点就已经足以使有财产的人倾心迷恋，除此而外，至少我听说，她拥有从托茨基和罗戈任那儿得到的大笔财产，珍珠钻石，衣物家具，因此眼前的选择不仅没有表现出亲爱的公爵所谓特别惹人注目的愚蠢，相反甚至证明了他的乖觉睿智、聪明颖悟和精明练达，因而也就促使我们得出一个相反的、对公爵来说完全是愉快的结论……”这个想法使列别杰夫大为惊讶；他就此罢休，并对公爵补充说，“现在，除了忠诚和甘洒热血，您从我身上看不到任何别的东西；我就是怀着这样的肝胆来的。” ＊法国外交家（１７５４一１８３８），此处用以比喻惯于玩弄手腕，狡诈多变的人。 伊波利特这些日子也让公爵分心。他差人来叫公爵的次数太频繁了。他们家住在一幢小屋子里，离公爵家不远；小孩子们，即伊波利特的弟弟和妹妹喜欢这幢别墅，至少是因为可以躲开生病的兄长去花园玩；可怜的大尉夫人则完全听从他的摆布，十足成为他的牺牲品；公爵每天都得为他们劝架，调解，病人则继续称他是自己的 “保姆”，同时因为他扮演调解者的角色而似乎敢于蔑视他。他对科利亚非常不满，因为他几乎不到他哪儿去，先是留在濒死的父亲身边，后来又陪着成了寡妇的母亲，最后，科利亚又把公爵即将与纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜结婚这件事作为嘲笑的目标，结果使公爵的自尊心受到了侮辱，最终弄得他发脾气，也就不再来看他。过了两天，大尉夫人一早便款款而来，流着眼泪请求公爵到他们家去，不然那个活宝会把她一口吞了。她还补充说，他有一个重大的秘密想泄露给公爵。于是公爵去了。伊波利特希望和解，还哭了起来，哭过以后当然更加怨恨，但是只是不敢说出来罢了。他的身体状况很糟，从一切迹象来看，现在已经不久于人世了。他并没有什么秘密要告诉，唯有激动得喘不过气来（也许是装出来的）说出的强烈请求“要当心罗戈任。这个人是不达目的不肯罢休的，公爵，他可非是您我之辈，这个人只要想干，那是不会胆战心惊的……”等等，等等，公爵开始详细地询问，他想要得到若干事实；但是除了伊波利特的个人感受和印象外，没有任何事实。伊波利特非常满足，他终于把公爵吓得够呛。开始公爵不愿意回答他的一些特别的问题，对于他的主意“甚至哪怕是逃到国外去；到处都有俄国的神父，在那边也可以结婚”，他也只是报以微笑。但是，未了伊波利特讲了下面一个想法：“我只是为阿格拉娅·伊万诺夫娜担心：罗戈任知道，您是多么爱她；他就会以爱换爱；您从他那里夺走了纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜，他会杀死阿格拉娅·费利帕夫娜；虽然她现在不是您的人，但您还是会感到难受的，不是吗？” 伊波利特达到了目的；公爵离开他的时候魂不守舍，神情恍惚。 公爵听到这番有关罗戈任的警告已经是在婚礼前一天了。这一天晚上，在婚礼前最后一次公爵与纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜见面；但是纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜未能使他放下心来，甚至相反，近来她越来越增添了他的惶惑。过去，即几天前。每当与他会面她总是想方设法竭力使他开心，他那忧郁的神态让她害怕得不得了：她甚至尝试唱歌给他听；最经常的是给他讲她能记得的一切可笑的事情。公爵几乎总是装出非常好笑的样子，当她讲得激动的时候（而她往往讲起来很投入），有时会显露出卓越的才智和豁达的感情，这时他也确实会对此而发笑，看到公爵发笑，看到讲故事使公爵产生了印象，她自己也欣喜万分，开始感到自豪。但是现在她的忧虑和沉思几乎每小时都在递增。公爵对纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜的看法已经确定不移，不然，她这一切现在自然会使他觉得莫名其妙和不可理解。但是他真诚地相信，她还会恢复过来的，他完全真实地对叶甫盖尼·帕夫洛维奇说，他真心实意地爱她，他对她的爱确实包含着一种犹如对一个可怜的病孩的爱，而对这样的病孩是很难、甚至是不可能放任不管的。公爵没向任何人解释过自己对她的感情，甚至也不喜欢谈论这个话题，即使不能回避这样的谈话也是这样。他与纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜一起坐着时，也从来不谈及“感情”，仿佛两人都发了誓似的。任何人都可以加入他们平时那愉快活泼的谈话。达里娅·阿列克谢耶夫娜后来说，这一段时间她望着他们，只觉得赏心悦目，欢喜异常。 但是公爵对纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜精神和理智状态的这种看法多少使他摆脱了许多其他的困惑，现在这已经完全不同于三个月前他认识的那个女人了。现在他已经不去考虑，比如说，为什么她当初流着眼泪、发出诅咒和责备逃避与他结婚，而现在她自己却坚持要尽快举行婚礼？“看来，她已经不像当时那样害怕与他结婚会给他带来不幸，”公爵想。这么快滋生的自信，在公爵看来，在她身上是不自然的，而且，光是对阿格拉娅的憎恨也不可能产生这种自信：纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜的感情要深沉些。是不是罗戈任这样的结局令她感到害怕？总之，所有这些及其他的原因可能都是存在的，但是对于公爵来说最清楚的，也正是他早已怀疑的原因是，她那不幸的、痛苦的心灵承受不了。这一切虽然在某种程度上可以摆脱困惑，但是并不能使他在这段时间里得到安宁和休息。有时候他竭力什么都不去想；对于结婚，他似乎确实把它看做是某种并不那么重要的形式；对于自己个人的命运他也看得过于无足轻重。至于别人的反对、谈话（类似与叶甫盖尼·帕夫洛维奇的谈话），他则绝对什么也不能回答，认为自己完全无以应对，因此总是回避这一类的各种谈话。 不过，他发现，纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜非常清楚地知道和明白，阿拉拉娅对他来说意味着什么，只不过她不说罢了。开始的时候，她有时撞上他正打算去叶潘钦家，他看到过这种时候她的脸上的表情。叶潘钦家离去后，她简直容光焕发。无论他多么不在意和不多心，但有一个想法却使他不得安宁：为了把阿格拉娅逼走帕夫洛夫斯克，纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜是下决心要大闹一场的。有关婚礼的流言传遍了所有的别墅，闹得满城风雨，当然，这多少是得到纳斯塔西娅、·费利帕夫娜的支持的。这是为了刺激对方。因为很少遇到叶潘钦一家，因此有一天纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜让公爵坐在她的马车上，吩咐从叶潘钦家别墅的窗前驶过，对公爵来说这是可怕的意外；照例，等他恍然大悟时，事情已经无法挽回，马车已经驶过了窗前。他什么话也没有说，但这以后连续病了两天；纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜已经不敢再重复做这样的试验。婚礼前最后几天她变得思虑重重；以往她最终总是战胜自己的忧愁，重又变得快活起来，但这次不知怎么比较平静，不怎么闹腾，也不像还是不久前的过去那样幸福快活。公爵加倍注意起她来，使他觉得好奇的是，她从来不跟他谈起罗戈任。只是有一次，那是婚礼前五天左右，达里娅·阿列克谢耶夫娜突然差人来说，让他马上去，因为纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜情况很糟糕，他发现她像是处于完全神经失常的状态：她大叫大嚷，浑身打颤，高喊着，罗戈行躲在花园里，就在他们家里，说什么她刚才看见他了，还说夜里他要杀死她……要宰了她！整整一天她都不能镇静下来。但就在那天晚上，公爵到伊波利特那儿去了一会，去城里办什么事刚回来的大尉夫人说，今天在彼得堡罗戈任去她家找过她，打听帕夫洛夫斯克的情况。公爵问罗戈任究竟是什么时候去的，大尉夫人讲的时间正是纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜说的今天在花园里仿佛看见他的时辰。事情只能解释为纯粹是幻觉；纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜自己去大尉夫人那里比较详细地询问清楚，这才大大得到安慰。 婚礼前夕公爵离开纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜时，她正处于极大的振奋之中：从彼得堡女时装师那里送来了明天穿的服饰：婚礼裙，帽子等等。公爵没有料到，她对这些服饰竟会如此激动；他自己则对所有的衣物都赞美一通，他的赞美更使她感到幸福。但是她说漏了嘴：她已经听说了，城里一片忿忿之声，而且某些浪荡公子确实在策划起哄喧闹，还有音乐，大概还有特意为此创作的诗歌，而这一切几乎得到其余各界人士的赞同的。但她现在偏要在他们面前把头抬得更高些，她要用独具风采和富有豪华的服饰压倒所有的人，“如果他们敢，就让他们去喊吧，让他们去打唿哨吧！”一想到这一点她的双眼就闪闪发光，她还有一个隐藏在心里的愿望，但是她没有说出口。她希望，阿格拉娅或者起码是她派来的什么人不露身份地也将混在人群中、在教堂里瞧着并看见这一切，为此她暗自做着准备。她跟公爵分手的时候，脑子里尽是这些想法，那是在晚上１１点左右；但还没有敲响半夜的钟声，达里娅·阿列克谢耶夫娜派人来找公爵，让他“尽快去，情况非常糟糕”。公爵赶去时，未婚妻正锁在卧室里，绝望地痛哭流涕，大发歇斯底里；很长时间她什么话也听不清，不听别人隔着锁音的门对她说的话，后来她开了门，只放公爵一人进去；在他身后又锁上门，便跪倒在他面前。（至少达里娅·阿列克谢耶夫娜事后这样转述的，她得以偷看到一点当时的情景。） “我在干什么呀！我在干什么呀！我在对你干什么呀！”她大声呼号着，痉挛地抱住他的双腿。 公爵陪她一起坐了整整1小时；我不知道他们谈了些什么。达里娅·阿列克谢耶夫娜说，过了1小时他们平静和幸福地分了手。这天夜里公爵还再次派人来探询，但纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜已经睡着了。第二天早晨，她还没有醒，公爵又两次派人到达里娅·阿列克谢耶夫娜那儿去，第三个派去的人受托转告“纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜身边现在围着一大群从彼得堡来的时装师和理发师，昨天的样子已荡然无影无踪，现在她忙着，像她这么一个美人在婚礼前只能忙自己的服饰了，现在，正是此时，正在进行紧急商讨，究竟戴什么钻石首饰，怎么戴？”公爵这才完全放下心来。 有关这场婚礼后来的全部情况是知道内情的人讲的，以下所述好像是真实的。 婚礼议式定在晚上8点钟；纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜７点钟时已准备就绪。６点钟起在列别杰夫别墅周围已陆陆续续聚拢起看热闹的人群，而在达里娅·阿烈克谢耶夫娜屋子旁边尤其如此；７点钟起教堂里也开始挤满了人。维拉·列别杰娃和科利亚为公爵极为担心骇怕；但是家里有许多事情要他们张罗：他们正安排着在公爵房间里接待和招待客人。不过，婚礼后估计几乎不会有什么聚会；除了一些婚礼时必须在场的人以外，列别杰夫还邀请了普季岑夫妇，加尼亚，脖子上挂安娜勋章的大夫，达里娅·阿列克谢耶夫娜。ω公爵好奇地问列别杰夫，为什么他想出来邀请“几乎完全不熟识的”大夫，后者自鸣得意地回答说：“他脖子上挂着勋章，是个受人尊敬的人，为了装装门面，”使得公爵大笑一阵。凯勒尔和布尔多夫斯基身穿燕尾服，戴着手套，看起来体面得很；只是凯勒尔仍然有点使公爵和信赖他的人感到尴尬，因为他虽然表现出准备斗殴的架势，非常敌意地望着聚在家门口看热闹的人群。终于，在７点半时公爵坐在马车出发去教堂，顺便我想指出，他自己故意不想放过任何一种习俗和惯例；一切都是堂而皇之、众目昭著、不加掩饰地“照章办事”。在教堂里，凯勒尔向左右两边投去威严的目光，引领着公爵在公众不停地窃窃私语和连连感叹声中好不容易穿过人群，使公爵得以暂时躲进祭坛，而凯勒尔去接新娘；在达里娅·阿列克谢耶夫娜屋子的台阶旁他发现人群不仅要比公爵家门口聚集的多二三倍，而且他们的放肆程度也许也是那里的三倍。登上台阶的时候，他也听到了喊叫声，以致无法容忍，完全已经打算对公众说些应说的话，但幸亏布尔多夫斯基和从台阶上跑下来的达里娅·阿列克谢耶夫娜自己制止了他；他们挟着他，好不容易才把他带进房间里。凯勒尔很是恼人并急着要走。纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜站起身，再次照了下镜子，据后来凯勒尔转述，她带着苦笑说，她的脸“像死人一样苍白”，接着虔诚地朝圣像行了礼，便走到外面台阶上。喧闹的人声欢迎她的出现，确实，最初一瞬间曾听到笑声，掌声，甚至哨声；但过了这一瞬间便响起了别的声音： “好一个美人！”人群中有人喊道。 “她不是第一个，也不是最后一个！” “一切都被花冠掩盖起来了，傻瓜！” “不，您要是找得到这样的绝色美人，乌拉！”靠近的一些人嚷着。 “公爵夫人！为这样的公爵夫人我愿意出卖灵魂！”一个办公室小职员喊了起来，“我愿用生命的代价来买一夜的欢爱！……” 纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜走出来时确实脸色白如绢帕；但是她那双又黑又大的眼睛犹如两颗烧红的炭粒向人群闪闪发光；人们受不了这样的目光；气忿变成了狂呼，马车上的小门已经打开，凯勒尔已经把手递给新娘，突然她惊呼一声，从台阶上直扑人群。所有送她的人都惊得呆若木鸡，人群在她面前向两旁分开，在离台阶五六步远处突然出现了罗戈任，纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜在人群中捕捉到的正是他的目光。她像疯子似的跑到他面前，抓住他的双手。 “救救我：带我走！随你去哪儿，马上就走！” 罗戈任扶着她，几乎把她抱了起来，差不多一直送到马车旁。接着，一眨眼，他从钱包里掏出１００卢布的票子，递给了马车夫。 “上火车站，要是赶上了车，再加１００！” 说着，跟在纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜后面他自己也跳上了马车，关上了门。马车夫一刻也不犹豫就在马身上抽了一鞭。事后凯勒尔推托事情发生得太意外：“要是再有１秒钟，我就会想出办法，我就不许他们走的！”他叙述这件意外事时解释说。本来他与布尔多夫斯基逮住一辆凑巧也在那里的另一辆马车，赶着追了一阵，但是已经是在途中了，他又改变了主意，认为“无论如何是迟了！强拉也拉不回来！” “再说公爵也不愿那样做！”十分震惊的布尔多夫斯基断然说。 而罗戈任与纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜及时驶抵车站。罗戈任走出马车，几乎就在上火车前，还未来得及拦住一个过路的姑娘，她穿着一件很体面的深色的旧斗蓬，头上扎着一条丝绸头巾。 “我愿用５０卢布买您的斗逢！”他突然把钱递给姑娘。她刚来得及惊讶，刚准备弄明白是怎么回事，他已经把５０卢布塞进她的手里，并脱下她的斗蓬和头巾，一古脑儿披到纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜的肩上和头上。她那华丽的服饰太惹人注目，在火车上会吸引别人的注意，直到后来姑娘才明白，为什么要出这样的高价向她买这件不值一钱的旧斗逢。 这件意外事以异常快的速度沸沸扬扬传到了教堂。当凯勒尔走到公爵眼前，许多他完全不认识的人立即过来问询。议论声顿时鹊起，人们摇头，甚至嘲笑，谁也没有走出教堂，都等着看新郎怎么对待这一消息。公爵脸色刷白，但很平静地接受了这一消息，他说：“我担心过，但是我终究没有想到会有这样的事……”后来，沉默了一会以后，他又补了一句：“不过……处于她这种状态……这完全是理所当然的。”后来凯勒尔自己也把这种反应称为“绝无仅有的哲学”。公爵从教堂出来时显然很平静，也很精神；至少许多人注意到是这样，后来也是这么说的。好像他很想回到家，尽快一个人呆着；但是却没有让他这样。破槽来的宾客中有些人跟着他走进了房间，其中有普季岑，加夫里拉·阿尔达利翁诺维奇以及与他们在一起的也认为不该走开的大夫。此外，整幢屋子简直围满了闲人。还是从露台上公爵就听到凯勒尔和列别杰夫与几个完全不认识的人在剧烈争吵，哪几个人看样子是些小官吏，他们说什么也想进来到露台上。公爵走到争吵的人们那里，了解究竟是怎么一回事，客气地让凯勒尔和列别杰夫回避。几个想进来的人中为首的一个站在台阶上，他已经鬓鬓斑白；但身体结实。公爵彬彬有礼地转向这位先生，邀请他赏脸光临。这位先生倒不好意思起来，但还是朝里走了，跟在他后面第二个，第三个。整个人群中有七八个拜访者，他们走了进来，竭力想尽可能显得随便些；但是没有更多的自告奋勇者，而且不久人群中就开始谴责这些好出头露面的人。公爵请进来的人坐下，便开始交谈，有人送上了茶水，这一切做得非常有礼貌，谦恭温雅，颇使进来者感到惊讶。当然，曾经有几次尝试想使谈话活泼起来，并引到“应该说”的话题上去；也曾提了一些不客气的问题，发表了几点“不怀好意的”意见。公爵回答大家既殷切随便，同时又不失尊严，也表示相信自己的客人规矩正派，因而不客气的问题自然而然地下再提了，渐渐地谈话开始变得一本正经起来。一位先生老是说话，突然异常愤慨地发言说，无论发生什么情况，他都不会把庄园卖了；相反，他要等待并要等出头，他认为“家业胜了金钱”；“亲爱的阁下，这就是我的经济体制，您可以记住。”因为他是对公爵说话，所以公爵不愿列别杰夫在他耳语说这位先生上无片瓦下无寸土、从来也没有什么庄园，还是热情地赞扬了他。过了１小时，茶也喝完了，客人们终于觉得不好意思继续坐下去。”大夫和头鬓斑白的先生热情地与公爵告别；所有的人都热情喧闹地道了别。他们表示了祝愿的意见；类如“没什么好痛苦的，也许，这反而会变好”等等。确实，也有人企图要香槟酒喝的，但年长的客人制止了年轻人。当大家都散去后，凯勒尔俯身对列别杰夫说：“我和你会弄出喊叫吵闹、斗殴出丑，引来警察；而他，瞧，倒给自己找到了新朋友，且是些什么样的人哟，我知道他们！”列别杰夫已经相当“醉了”，叹了口气说：“他对聪明明智的人隐瞒真情，对天真幼稚的人坦露胸怀，还在以前我就说过他这一点了。但现在我要补充说，上帝保佑了他这个天真幼稚的人本人，把他从深渊里救了出来，是上帝和众圣人救了他！” 终于，将近１０点半了，才留下公爵一个人，他觉得头痛；科利亚最迟离开，他帮公爵换下结婚礼服穿上家常便服。他们热情地分了手。科利亚没有多说所发生的事件，但答应明天早点来，后来他证明，在最后一次告别时公爵没有预示他什么，看来，甚至对他也隐瞒了自己的意图。很快整幢屋子里几乎谁也没有留下：布尔多夫斯基去伊波利特那儿，凯勒尔和列别杰夫也不知道去了哪儿。只有维拉·列别杰娃还在公爵的几个房屋里耽了些时候，匆匆把房间里结婚喜庆的布置除去，换成平常的样子。离开的时候她去看了一下公爵。他坐在桌子旁，双时撑在桌上，双手捧着脑袋。她悄悄地走到他眼前，碰了一下他的肩膀；公爵困感地望了她一下，几乎用了１分钟时间仿佛回想什么；但是等他想起并弄清一切后，一下子又异常激动起来。不过，最后他向维拉提了个急切而不同寻常的请求，要她第二天早晨７点钟敲他房间的门，以便去赶第一班火车。维拉答应了；公爵又开始热烈地请求她别将此事告诉任何人；她也答应了这一点，最后，维拉已经完全打开了门准备离去时，公爵第三次叫住了她，拿起她的手吻了吻，接着又吻了吻她的前额，并以一种“不同平常”的神态对她说：“明天见！”至少后来维拉是这样转告的。她走开时为他感到极大的担忧骇怕。第二天早晨按约走时间７点钟，她稍微振作精神，敲了他的门，并告诉他去彼得堡的火车过１刻钟开；她觉得，他为她开门时精神饱满，甚至还脸带微笑。夜里他几乎没有脱衣服，但是睡了。照他说的，他今天会回来。看来，结果是，他认为此刻只能也只需告诉她一人，他是去城里。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/256/2413.html","bookId":242,"book":{"id":242,"title":"白痴
