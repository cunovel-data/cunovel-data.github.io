{"id":7409,"no":30,"title":"Part 3 Chapter 2","content":"THE prince suddenly approached Evgenie Pavlovitch.\n \"Evgenie Pavlovitch,\" he said, with strange excitement and seizing the latter\u0027s hand in his own, \"be assured that I esteem you as a generous and honourable man, in spite of everything. Be assured of that.\"\n Evgenie Pavlovitch fell back a step in astonishment. For one moment it was all he could do to restrain himself from bursting out laughing; but, looking closer, he observed that the prince did not seem to be quite himself; at all events, he was in a very curious state.\n \"I wouldn\u0027t mind betting, prince,\" he cried, \"that you did not in the least mean to say that, and very likely you meant to address someone else altogether. What is it? Are you feeling unwell or anything?\"\n \"Very likely, extremely likely, and you must be a very close observer to detect the fact that perhaps I did not intend to come up to YOU at all.\"\n So saying he smiled strangely; but suddenly and excitedly he began again:\n \"Don\u0027t remind me of what I have done or said. Don\u0027t! I am very much ashamed of myself, I--\"\n \"Why, what have you done? I don\u0027t understand you.\"\n \"I see you are ashamed of me, Evgenie Pavlovitch; you are blushing for me; that\u0027s a sign of a good heart. Don\u0027t be afraid; I shall go away directly.\"\n \"What\u0027s the matter with him? Do his fits begin like that?\" said Lizabetha Prokofievna, in a high state of alarm, addressing Colia.\n \"No, no, Lizabetha Prokofievna, take no notice of me. I am not going to have a fit. I will go away directly; but I know I am afflicted. I was twenty-four years an invalid, you see--the first twenty-four years of my life--so take all I do and say as the sayings and actions of an invalid. I\u0027m going away directly, I really am--don\u0027t be afraid. I am not blushing, for I don\u0027t think I need blush about it, need I? But I see that I am out of place in society--society is better without me. It\u0027s not vanity, I assure you. I have thought over it all these last three days, and I have made up my mind that I ought to unbosom myself candidly before you at the first opportunity. There are certain things, certain great ideas, which I must not so much as approach, as Prince S. has just reminded me, or I shall make you all laugh. I have no sense of proportion, I know; my words and gestures do not express my ideas--they are a humiliation and abasement of the ideas, and therefore, I have no right--and I am too sensitive. Still, I believe I am beloved in this household, and esteemed far more than I deserve. But I can\u0027t help knowing that after twenty-four years of illness there must be some trace left, so that it is impossible for people to refrain from laughing at me sometimes; don\u0027t you think so?\"\n He seemed to pause for a reply, for some verdict, as it were, and looked humbly around him.\n All present stood rooted to the earth with amazement at this unexpected and apparently uncalled-for outbreak; but the poor prince\u0027s painful and rambling speech gave rise to a strange episode.\n \"Why do you say all this here?\" cried Aglaya, suddenly. \"Why do you talk like this to THEM?\"\n She appeared to be in the last stages of wrath and irritation; her eyes flashed. The prince stood dumbly and blindly before her, and suddenly grew pale.\n \"There is not one of them all who is worthy of these words of yours,\" continued Aglaya. \"Not one of them is worth your little finger, not one of them has heart or head to compare with yours! You are more honest than all, and better, nobler, kinder, wiser than all. There are some here who are unworthy to bend and pick up the handkerchief you have just dropped. Why do you humiliate yourself like this, and place yourself lower than these people? Why do you debase yourself before them? Why have you no pride?\"\n \"My God! Who would ever have believed this?\" cried Mrs. Epanchin, wringing her hands.\n \"Hurrah for the \u0027poor knight\u0027!\" cried Colia.\n \"Be quiet! How dare they laugh at me in your house?\" said Aglaya, turning sharply on her mother in that hysterical frame of mind that rides recklessly over every obstacle and plunges blindly through proprieties. \"Why does everyone, everyone worry and torment me? Why have they all been bullying me these three days about you, prince? I will not marry you--never, and under no circumstances! Know that once and for all; as if anyone could marry an absurd creature like you! Just look in the glass and see what you look like, this very moment! Why, WHY do they torment me and say I am going to marry you? You must know it; you are in the plot with them!\"\n \"No one ever tormented you on the subject,\" murmured Adelaida, aghast.\n \"No one ever thought of such a thing! There has never been a word said about it!\" cried Alexandra.\n \"Who has been annoying her? Who has been tormenting the child? Who could have said such a thing to her? Is she raving?\" cried Lizabetha Prokofievna, trembling with rage, to the company in general.\n \"Every one of them has been saying it--every one of them--all these three days! And I will never, never marry him!\"\n So saying, Aglaya burst into bitter tears, and, hiding her face in her handkerchief, sank back into a chair.\n \"But he has never even--\"\n \"I have never asked you to marry me, Aglaya Ivanovna!\" said the prince, of a sudden.\n \"WHAT?\" cried Mrs. Epanchin, raising her hands in horror. \"WHAT\u0027S that?\"\n She could not believe her ears.\n \"I meant to say--I only meant to say,\" said the prince, faltering, \"I merely meant to explain to Aglaya Ivanovna--to have the honour to explain, as it were--that I had no intention--never had--to ask the honour of her hand. I assure you I am not guilty, Aglaya Ivanovna, I am not, indeed. I never did wish to--I never thought of it at all--and never shall--you\u0027ll see it yourself-- you may be quite assured of it. Some wicked person has been maligning me to you; but it\u0027s all right. Don\u0027t worry about it.\"\n So saying, the prince approached Aglaya.\n She took the handkerchief from her face, glanced keenly at him, took in what he had said, and burst out laughing--such a merry, unrestrained laugh, so hearty and gay, that. Adelaida could not contain herself. She, too, glanced at the prince\u0027s panic-stricken countenance, then rushed at her sister, threw her arms round her neck, and burst into as merry a fit of laughter as Aglaya\u0027s own. They laughed together like a couple of school-girls. Hearing and seeing this, the prince smiled happily, and in accents of relief and joy, he exclaimed \"Well, thank God--thank God!\"\n Alexandra now joined in, and it looked as though the three sisters were going to laugh on for ever.\n \"They are insane,\" muttered Lizabetha Prokofievna. \"Either they frighten one out of one\u0027s wits, or else--\"\n But Prince S. was laughing now, too, so was Evgenie Pavlovitch, so was Colia, and so was the prince himself, who caught the infection as he looked round radiantly upon the others.\n \"Come along, let\u0027s go out for a walk!\" cried Adelaida. \"We\u0027ll all go together, and the prince must absolutely go with us. You needn\u0027t go away, you dear good fellow! ISN\u0027T he a dear, Aglaya? Isn\u0027t he, mother? I must really give him a kiss for--for his explanation to Aglaya just now. Mother, dear, I may kiss him, mayn\u0027t I? Aglaya, may I kiss YOUR prince?\" cried the young rogue, and sure enough she skipped up to the prince and kissed his forehead.\n He seized her hands, and pressed them so hard that Adelaida nearly cried out; he then gazed with delight into her eyes, and raising her right hand to his lips with enthusiasm, kissed it three times.\n \"Come along,\" said Aglaya. \"Prince, you must walk with me. May he, mother? This young cavalier, who won\u0027t have me? You said you would NEVER have me, didn\u0027t you, prince? No-no, not like that; THAT\u0027S not the way to give your arm. Don\u0027t you know how to give your arm to a lady yet? There--so. Now, come along, you and I will lead the way. Would you like to lead the way with me alone, tete-a-tete?\"\n She went on talking and chatting without a pause, with occasional little bursts of laughter between.\n \"Thank God--thank God!\" said Lizabetha Prokofievna to herself, without quite knowing why she felt so relieved.\n \"What extraordinary people they are!\" thought Prince S., for perhaps the hundredth time since he had entered into intimate relations with the family; but--he liked these \"extraordinary people,\" all the same. As for Prince Lef Nicolaievitch himself, Prince S. did not seem quite to like him, somehow. He was decidedly preoccupied and a little disturbed as they all started off.\n Evgenie Pavlovitch seemed to be in a lively humour. He made Adelaida and Alexandra laugh all the way to the Vauxhall; but they both laughed so very really and promptly that the worthy Evgenie began at last to suspect that they were not listening to him at all.\n At this idea, he burst out laughing all at once, in quite unaffected mirth, and without giving any explanation.\n The sisters, who also appeared to be in high spirits, never tired of glancing at Aglaya and the prince, who were walking in front. It was evident that their younger sister was a thorough puzzle to them both.\n Prince S. tried hard to get up a conversation with Mrs. Epanchin upon outside subjects, probably with the good intention of distracting and amusing her; but he bored her dreadfully. She was absent-minded to a degree, and answered at cross purposes, and sometimes not at all.\n But the puzzle and mystery of Aglaya was not yet over for the evening. The last exhibition fell to the lot of the prince alone. When they had proceeded some hundred paces or so from the house, Aglaya said to her obstinately silent cavalier in a quick half- whisper:\n \"Look to the right!\"\n The prince glanced in the direction indicated.\n \"Look closer. Do you see that bench, in the park there, just by those three big trees--that green bench?\"\n The prince replied that he saw it.\n \"Do you like the position of it? Sometimes of a morning early, at seven o\u0027clock, when all the rest are still asleep, I come out and sit there alone.\"\n The prince muttered that the spot was a lovely one.\n \"Now, go away, I don\u0027t wish to have your arm any longer; or perhaps, better, continue to give me your arm, and walk along beside me, but don\u0027t speak a word to me. I wish to think by myself.\"\n The warning was certainly unnecessary; for the prince would not have said a word all the rest of the time whether forbidden to speak or not. His heart beat loud and painfully when Aglaya spoke of the bench; could she--but no! he banished the thought, after an instant\u0027s deliberation.\n At Pavlofsk, on weekdays, the public is more select than it is on Sundays and Saturdays, when the townsfolk come down to walk about and enjoy the park.\n The ladies dress elegantly, on these days, and it is the fashion to gather round the band, which is probably the best of our pleasure-garden bands, and plays the newest pieces. The behaviour of the public is most correct and proper, and there is an appearance of friendly intimacy among the usual frequenters. Many come for nothing but to look at their acquaintances, but there are others who come for the sake of the music. It is very seldom that anything happens to break the harmony of the proceedings, though, of course, accidents will happen everywhere.\n On this particular evening the weather was lovely, and there were a large number of people present. All the places anywhere near the orchestra were occupied.\n Our friends took chairs near the side exit. The crowd and the music cheered Mrs. Epanchin a little, and amused the girls; they bowed and shook hands with some of their friends and nodded at a distance to others; they examined the ladies\u0027 dresses, noticed comicalities and eccentricities among the people, and laughed and talked among themselves. Evgenie Pavlovitch, too, found plenty of friends to bow to. Several people noticed Aglaya and the prince, who were still together.\n Before very long two or three young men had come up, and one or two remained to talk; all of these young men appeared to be on intimate terms with Evgenie Pavlovitch. Among them was a young officer, a remarkably handsome fellow--very good-natured and a great chatterbox. He tried to get up a conversation with Aglaya, and did his best to secure her attention. Aglaya behaved very graciously to him, and chatted and laughed merrily. Evgenie Pavlovitch begged the prince\u0027s leave to introduce their friend to him. The prince hardly realized what was wanted of him, but the introduction came off; the two men bowed and shook hands.\n Evgenie Pavlovitch\u0027s friend asked the prince some question, but the latter did not reply, or if he did, he muttered something so strangely indistinct that there was nothing to be made of it. The officer stared intently at him, then glanced at Evgenie, divined why the latter had introduced him, and gave his undivided attention to Aglaya again. Only Evgenie Pavlovitch observed that Aglaya flushed up for a moment at this.\n The prince did not notice that others were talking and making themselves agreeable to Aglaya; in fact, at moments, he almost forgot that he was sitting by her himself. At other moments he felt a longing to go away somewhere and be alone with his thoughts, and to feel that no one knew where he was.\n Or if that were impossible he would like to be alone at home, on the terrace-without either Lebedeff or his children, or anyone else about him, and to lie there and think--a day and night and another day again! He thought of the mountains-and especially of a certain spot which he used to frequent, whence he would look down upon the distant valleys and fields, and see the waterfall, far off, like a little silver thread, and the old ruined castle in the distance. Oh! how he longed to be there now--alone with his thoughts--to think of one thing all his life--one thing! A thousand years would not be too much time! And let everyone here forget him--forget him utterly! How much better it would have been if they had never known him--if all this could but prove to be a dream. Perhaps it was a dream!\n Now and then he looked at Aglaya for five minutes at a time, without taking his eyes off her face; but his expression was very strange; he would gaze at her as though she were an object a couple of miles distant, or as though he were looking at her portrait and not at herself at all.\n \"Why do you look at me like that, prince?\" she asked suddenly, breaking off her merry conversation and laughter with those about her. \"I\u0027m afraid of you! You look as though you were just going to put out your hand and touch my face to see if it\u0027s real! Doesn\u0027t he, Evgenie Pavlovitch--doesn\u0027t he look like that?\"\n The prince seemed surprised that he should have been addressed at all; he reflected a moment, but did not seem to take in what had been said to him; at all events, he did not answer. But observing that she and the others had begun to laugh, he too opened his mouth and laughed with them.\n The laughter became general, and the young officer, who seemed a particularly lively sort of person, simply shook with mirth.\n Aglaya suddenly whispered angrily to herself the word--\n \"Idiot!\"\n \"My goodness--surely she is not in love with such a--surely she isn\u0027t mad!\" groaned Mrs. Epanchin, under her breath.\n \"It\u0027s all a joke, mamma; it\u0027s just a joke like the \u0027poor knight\u0027 --nothing more whatever, I assure you!\" Alexandra whispered in her ear. \"She is chaffing him--making a fool of him, after her own private fashion, that\u0027s all! But she carries it just a little too far--she is a regular little actress. How she frightened us just now--didn\u0027t she?--and all for a lark!\"\n \"Well, it\u0027s lucky she has happened upon an idiot, then, that\u0027s all I can say!\" whispered Lizabetha Prokofievna, who was somewhat comforted, however, by her daughter\u0027s remark.\n The prince had heard himself referred to as \"idiot,\" and had shuddered at the moment; but his shudder, it so happened, was not caused by the word applied to him. The fact was that in the crowd, not far from where lie was sitting, a pale familiar face, with curly black hair, and a well-known smile and expression, had flashed across his vision for a moment, and disappeared again. Very likely he had imagined it! There only remained to him the impression of a strange smile, two eyes, and a bright green tie. Whether the man had disappeared among the crowd, or whether he had turned towards the Vauxhall, the prince could not say.\n But a moment or two afterwards he began to glance keenly about him. That first vision might only too likely be the forerunner of a second; it was almost certain to be so. Surely he had not forgotten the possibility of such a meeting when he came to the Vauxhall? True enough, he had not remarked where he was coming to when he set out with Aglaya; he had not been in a condition to remark anything at all.\n Had he been more careful to observe his companion, he would have seen that for the last quarter of an hour Aglaya had also been glancing around in apparent anxiety, as though she expected to see someone, or something particular, among the crowd of people. Now, at the moment when his own anxiety became so marked, her excitement also increased visibly, and when he looked about him, she did the same.\n The reason for their anxiety soon became apparent. From that very side entrance to the Vauxhall, near which the prince and all the Epanchin party were seated, there suddenly appeared quite a large knot of persons, at least a dozen.\n Heading this little band walked three ladies, two of whom were remarkably lovely; and there was nothing surprising in the fact that they should have had a large troop of admirers following in their wake.\n But there was something in the appearance of both the ladies and their admirers which was peculiar, quite different for that of the rest of the public assembled around the orchestra.\n Nearly everyone observed the little band advancing, and all pretended not to see or notice them, except a few young fellows who exchanged glances and smiled, saying something to one another in whispers.\n It was impossible to avoid noticing them, however, in reality, for they made their presence only too conspicuous by laughing and talking loudly. It was to be supposed that some of them were more than half drunk, although they were well enough dressed, some even particularly well. There were one or two, however, who were very strange-looking creatures, with flushed faces and extraordinary clothes; some were military men; not all were quite young; one or two were middle-aged gentlemen of decidedly disagreeable appearance, men who are avoided in society like the plague, decked out in large gold studs and rings, and magnificently \"got up,\" generally.\n Among our suburban resorts there are some which enjoy a specially high reputation for respectability and fashion; but the most careful individual is not absolutely exempt from the danger of a tile falling suddenly upon his head from his neighbour\u0027s roof.\n Such a tile was about to descend upon the elegant and decorous public now assembled to hear the music.\n No one else followed the eccentric lady; but as she descended the steps she did not even look behind her, as though it were absolutely the same to her whether anyone were following or not. She laughed and talked loudly, however, just as before. She was dressed with great taste, but with rather more magnificence than was needed for the occasion, perhaps.\n She walked past the orchestra, to where an open carriage was waiting, near the road.\n The prince had not seen HER for more than three months. All these days since his arrival from Petersburg he had intended to pay her a visit, but some mysterious presentiment had restrained him. He could not picture to himself what impression this meeting with her would make upon him, though he had often tried to imagine it, with fear and trembling. One fact was quite certain, and that was that the meeting would be painful.\n Several times during the last six months he had recalled the effect which the first sight of this face had had upon him, when he only saw its portrait. He recollected well that even the portrait face had left but too painful an impression.\n That month in the provinces, when he had seen this woman nearly every day, had affected him so deeply that he could not now look back upon it calmly. In the very look of this woman there was something which tortured him. In conversation with Rogojin he had attributed this sensation to pity--immeasurable pity, and this was the truth. The sight of the portrait face alone had filled his heart full of the agony of real sympathy; and this feeling of sympathy, nay, of actual SUFFERING, for her, had never left his heart since that hour, and was still in full force. Oh yes, and more powerful than ever!\n But the prince was not satisfied with what he had said to Rogojin. Only at this moment, when she suddenly made her appearance before him, did he realize to the full the exact emotion which she called up in him, and which he had not described correctly to Rogojin.\n And, indeed, there were no words in which he could have expressed his horror, yes, HORROR, for he was now fully convinced from his own private knowledge of her, that the woman was mad.\n If, loving a woman above everything in the world, or at least having a foretaste of the possibility of such love for her, one were suddenly to behold her on a chain, behind bars and under the lash of a keeper, one would feel something like what the poor prince now felt.\n \"What\u0027s the matter?\" asked Aglaya, in a whisper, giving his sleeve a little tug.\n He turned his head towards her and glanced at her black and (for some reason) flashing eyes, tried to smile, and then, apparently forgetting her in an instant, turned to the right once more, and continued to watch the startling apparition before him.\n Nastasia Philipovna was at this moment passing the young ladies\u0027 chairs.\n Evgenie Pavlovitch continued some apparently extremely funny and interesting anecdote to Alexandra, speaking quickly and with much animation. The prince remembered that at this moment Aglaya remarked in a half-whisper:\n \"WHAT a--\"\n She did not finish her indefinite sentence; she restrained herself in a moment; but it was enough.\n Nastasia Philipovna, who up to now had been walking along as though she had not noticed the Epanchin party, suddenly turned her head in their direction, as though she had just observed Evgenie Pavlovitch sitting there for the first time.\n \"Why, I declare, here he is!\" she cried, stopping suddenly. \"The man one can\u0027t find with all one\u0027s messengers sent about the place, sitting just under one\u0027s nose, exactly where one never thought of looking! I thought you were sure to be at your uncle\u0027s by this time.\"\n Evgenie Pavlovitch flushed up and looked angrily at Nastasia Philipovna, then turned his back on her.\n \"What I don\u0027t you know about it yet? He doesn\u0027t know--imagine that! Why, he\u0027s shot himself. Your uncle shot himself this very morning. I was told at two this afternoon. Half the town must know it by now. They say there are three hundred and fifty thousand roubles, government money, missing; some say five hundred thousand. And I was under the impression that he would leave you a fortune! He\u0027s whistled it all away. A most depraved old gentleman, really! Well, ta, ta!--bonne chance! Surely you intend to be off there, don\u0027t you? Ha, ha! You\u0027ve retired from the army in good time, I see! Plain clothes! Well done, sly rogue! Nonsense! I see--you knew it all before--I dare say you knew all about it yesterday-\"\n Although the impudence of this attack, this public proclamation of intimacy, as it were, was doubtless premeditated, and had its special object, yet Evgenie Pavlovitch at first seemed to intend to make no show of observing either his tormentor or her words. But Nastasia\u0027s communication struck him with the force of a thunderclap. On hearing of his uncle\u0027s death he suddenly grew as white as a sheet, and turned towards his informant.\n At this moment, Lizabetha Prokofievna rose swiftly from her seat, beckoned her companions, and left the place almost at a run.\n Only the prince stopped behind for a moment, as though in indecision; and Evgenie Pavlovitch lingered too, for he had not collected his scattered wits. But the Epanchins had not had time to get more than twenty paces away when a scandalous episode occurred. The young officer, Evgenie Pavlovitch\u0027s friend who had been conversing with Aglaya, said aloud in a great state of indignation:\n \"She ought to be whipped--that\u0027s the only way to deal with creatures like that--she ought to be whipped!\"\n This gentleman was a confidant of Evgenie\u0027s, and had doubtless heard of the carriage episode.\n Nastasia turned to him. Her eyes flashed; she rushed up to a young man standing near, whom she did not know in the least, but who happened to have in his hand a thin cane. Seizing this from him, she brought it with all her force across the face of her insulter.\n All this occurred, of course, in one instant of time.\n The young officer, forgetting himself, sprang towards her. Nastasia\u0027s followers were not by her at the moment (the elderly gentleman having disappeared altogether, and the younger man simply standing aside and roaring with laughter).\n In another moment, of course, the police would have been on the spot, and it would have gone hard with Nastasia Philipovna had not unexpected aid appeared.\n Muishkin, who was but a couple of steps away, had time to spring forward and seize the officer\u0027s arms from behind.\n The officer, tearing himself from the prince\u0027s grasp, pushed him so violently backwards that he staggered a few steps and then subsided into a chair.\n But there were other defenders for Nastasia on the spot by this time. The gentleman known as the \"boxer\" now confronted the enraged officer.\n \"Keller is my name, sir; ex-lieutenant,\" he said, very loud. \"If you will accept me as champion of the fair sex, I am at your disposal. English boxing has no secrets from me. I sympathize with you for the insult you have received, but I can\u0027t permit you to raise your hand against a woman in public. If you prefer to meet me--as would be more fitting to your rank--in some other manner, of course you understand me, captain.\"\n But the young officer had recovered himself, and was no longer listening. At this moment Rogojin appeared, elbowing through the crowd; he took Nastasia\u0027s hand, drew it through his arm, and quickly led her away. He appeared to be terribly excited; he was trembling all over, and was as pale as a corpse. As he carried Nastasia off, he turned and grinned horribly in the officer\u0027s face, and with low malice observed:\n \"Tfu! look what the fellow got! Look at the blood on his cheek! Ha, ha!\"\n Recollecting himself, however, and seeing at a glance the sort of people he had to deal with, the officer turned his back on both his opponents, and courteously, but concealing his face with his handkerchief, approached the prince, who was now rising from the chair into which he had fallen.\n \"Prince Muishkin, I believe? The gentleman to whom I had the honour of being introduced?\"\n \"She is mad, insane--I assure you, she is mad,\" replied the prince in trembling tones, holding out both his hands mechanically towards the officer.\n \"I cannot boast of any such knowledge, of course, but I wished to know your name.\"\n He bowed and retired without waiting for an answer.\n Five seconds after the disappearance of the last actor in this scene, the police arrived. The whole episode had not lasted more than a couple of minutes. Some of the spectators had risen from their places, and departed altogether; some merely exchanged their seats for others a little further off; some were delighted with the occurrence, and talked and laughed over it for a long time.\n In a word, the incident closed as such incidents do, and the band began to play again. The prince walked away after the Epanchin party. Had he thought of looking round to the left after he had been pushed so unceremoniously into the chair, he would have observed Aglaya standing some twenty yards away. She had stayed to watch the scandalous scene in spite of her mother\u0027s and sisters\u0027 anxious cries to her to come away.\n Prince S. ran up to her and persuaded her, at last, to come home with them.\n Lizabetha Prokofievna saw that she returned in such a state of agitation that it was doubtful whether she had even heard their calls. But only a couple of minutes later, when they had reached the park, Aglaya suddenly remarked, in her usual calm, indifferent voice:\n \"I wanted to see how the farce would end.\"\n \n 公爵突然走到叶甫盖尼·帕夫洛维奇跟前。\n “叶甫盖尼·帕夫雷奇，”他抓住他的手，用一种奇怪的热情说，“请相信，不论怎样，我认为您是最最高尚的人，最好的人；请相信这一点……”\n 叶甫盖尼·帕夫洛维奇惊讶得甚至后退了一步。有一瞬间他克制住忍不住要纵声大笑的愿望，但是当他走近仔细观察之后，他发现公爵似乎失去常态，至少是有点异常。\n “我敢打赌，”他喊了起来，“公爵，您想讲的根本不是这样的话，也许，也根本不是想对我说……但是您怎么啦？您是不是不舒服？”\n “也许是，很可能是，您很细致地注意到了，也许，我想找的不是您！”\n 说完这话，公爵有点奇怪地、甚至可笑地笑了一下，但是似乎很激动，突然大声嚷道：\n “请别向我提起三天前我的行为！这三天我感到非常羞愧……我知道是我不对……”\n “可是……可是您究竟做了什么令您这么痛苦的事呢？”\n “我看得出，大概您比其他的人更为我感到羞愧，叶甫盖尼·帕夫洛维奇；您现在脸红了，这是心灵美好的标志，我马上就走，请相信。”\n “他这是怎么啦？他这样是不是毛病开始发作了？”叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜惊恐地问科利亚。\n “你别在意，叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜，我不是发病，我马上就走。我知道，我……天生就亏，活了２４岁，生了２４年的病。现在就听我作为病人说几句话。我马上就走，马上，请相信。我不脸红，因为为此而脸红是会令人奇怪的，不对吗？但是在交际场合我是个多余的人……我这样说并非出于自尊……这三天里我反复思考并决定，一有机会就应该真心诚意和光明正大地告诉你们。有这样一些思想，有一些高尚的思想，我是不应该谈起的，因为我走会使大家觉得可笑的；ω公爵刚才提醒我的正是这一点……我不会做出体面的姿态，也没有分寸感；我说出来的是与想法不相符合的另一番话，而这是会损害这些想法的。因此我没有权利……何况我又生性多疑，我……我确信，在这个家里是不会亏侍我的，并且爱我比我所值得的爱更甚，但是我知道（我可是知道得很肯定），２０年的疾病一定会留下什么后果的，因此有时候……不能不使人笑话我……不是这样吗？”\n 他环顾周围，仿佛是等待回答和决定。大家都站在那里，被这种出乎意料的、病态的、不论怎样都似乎是无缘无故的举动弄得莫名其妙，尴尬万分。但是这一举动却为一段奇怪的插曲提供了缘由。\n “您在这里说这些话干什么？”突然阿格拉娅嚷了起来，“为了什么您对他们说这些？对他们！对他们！”\n 似乎她气忿到极点：她的眼睛都在冒火。公爵站在她面前哑然无语，不发一声，脸色一下子变得刷白。\n “这里没有任何人配听这样的话！”阿格拉娅发作了，“这里所有的人统统都不及您的一个小指头。无论是才智还是心灵都比不上！您比所有的人都更正直、更高尚、更优秀、更善良、更聪明！这里有的人甚至连弯下腰去捡您刚才掉在地上的手帕都不配……为了什么您要贬低自己，把自己置于所有人之下？为什么您要损害作践自己的一切，为什么您身上没有骨气？”\n “天哪，这能想到吗？”叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜双手一拍惊叹道。\n “可怜的骑士！乌拉！”科利亚欣喜若狂地喊着。\n “住嘴！……有人竟敢在您的家里欺侮我！”突然阿格拉娅冲看叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜说。她已经歇斯底里大发作，无视任何界限，逾越了一切障碍。“为什么大家、所有的人都无一例外地折磨我？公爵，整整三天由于您的缘故他们缠住我，这是为什么？我无论如何也不嫁给您！您要知道，无论如何，永远不嫁！您得知道这一点！难道可以嫁给您这样可笑的人？您现在照镜子看看自己，您现在配得上哪个！……为什么，为什么他们要逗我，说我要嫁给您？您应该知道这一点！您也是跟他们串通一气的！”\n “任何人，住何时候都没有逗过！”阿杰菜达惊恐地嘟哝着。\n “谁也没有这样想过，谁也没有说过这样的话！”亚历山德拉·伊万诺夫娜大声嚷道。\n “谁逗了她？什么时候逗她的？谁会对她说这种事？她是在说胡话还是怎么的？”叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜气得打颤，问大家。\n “所有的人都说过，每一个人都说了，整整三天！我永远、永远也不会嫁给他！”\n 喊过这些话后，阿格拉娅泣然泪下，痛苦地用手帕掩住脸，跌坐到椅子上。\n “可他还没有向你求……”\n “我没有向您求过婚，阿格拉娅·伊万诺夫娜，”公爵突然脱口而出。\n “什－么？”叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜又惊又气又怕地突然拖长了声音问，“怎么－回－事？”\n 她不敢相信自己的耳朵。\n “我只说……我想说，”公爵颤粟着说，“我只是想向阿格拉娅·伊万诺夫娜说明……我希望有幸能解释，我根本没有这种意图……没有想会有幸向她求婚……不管什么时候……。这事我丝毫没有过错，真的，我没有什么过错，阿格拉侄·伊万诺夫娜！我从来也没有想过，从来也没有动过这个念头，永远也不会有这样的事，您自己会看到的，请相信！这一定是哪个怀有恶意的人在悠面前诽谤我！请放心！”他一边说话，一边走近了阿格拉娅。她拿开了掩住脸面的手绢，很快地瞥了他一眼以及他那吓坏了的模样，弄清了他讲话的含意，突然径直对着他放声哈哈大笑起来，笑得这么快活开心，这么放纵不羁，这么滑稽可笑，这么嘲讽讥诮，以至阿杰莱达第一个忍不住，尤其在看了一眼公爵后，她便扑向妹妹，拥抱着她，和她一样像小学生似地快活地放声大笑起来。望着她们俩，公爵也忽然漾起微笑，并且带着高兴和幸福的表情反复喃喃着：\n “哦，谢天谢地，谢天谢地。”\n 亚历山德拉这时也忍不住由衷地大笑起来。三姐妹的这种笑声好像会没个完似的。\n “好了，一群疯丫头！”叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜嘟哝着，“一会把人吓得要死，一会又……”\n 但是现在ω公爵也已在笑了，叶甫盖尼·帕夫洛维奇也笑了，科利亚则笑个没停，而公爵望着大家也咯咯笑着。\n “我们去散步，我们去散步！”阿杰莱达喊道，“大家一起去，公爵一定要跟我们去，您用不着离开，您是个可爱的人！他是个可爱的人，阿格拉娅！您说是不是，妈妈？而且为了……为了刚才他向阿格拉娅表明态度，我一定要、一定得吻他和拥抱他一下。妈妈，亲爱的，允许我吻他一下吗？阿格拉娅！允许我吻一下你的公爵吗？”调皮的阿杰莱达真的蹦到公爵跟前，吻了一下他的额头。而公爵则抓住她的手，紧紧地握着，阿杰莱达差点没叫起来，他无比兴奋地望着她，突然把她的手抬向唇边，吻了三次。\n “我们走吧！”阿格拉娅招呼着，“公爵，您搀着我。可以吗，妈妈？让这个拒绝了我的未婚男子搀着行吗？公爵，您不是永远拒绝了我吗？唉，不是这样，不是这样把手递给女士的，您难道不知道，该怎样挽着女士？是这样的，我们走吧，我们走在大家前面；您愿意走在大家前面吗，ｔｅｔｅ－ａ－ｔｅｔｅ？＊”\n 她不停地说着，仍然不时地发出阵阵笑声。\n “谢天谢地！谢天谢地：”叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜反复念叨着，她自己也不知道为了什么而感到高兴。\n “真是些怪得异乎寻常的人！”ω公爵恩忖着，从与他们相识起来，也许已经是第一百次这样想了，但是……他喜欢这些古怪的人。至于说到梅什金公爵，也许他不那么喜欢他；当大家走去散步时，ω公爵有点阴郁，似乎心事重重。\n 叶甫盖尼·帕夫洛维奇似乎处于最开心的情绪之中，在到车站的一路上不断逗笑着亚历山德拉和阿杰莱达，而她们则带着一种已经过分的特别的乐意对他的玩笑话报之以嬉笑，甚至到了这种地步，他会在一瞬间怀疑起，也许她们根本不在听他讲。这个念头使他不解释原因便猛然哈哈大笑起来，而且完全是非常真诚地笑（他就是这样的性格！）。其实两姐妹的情绪就像过节一般高兴，她们不断地望着走在前面的公爵和阿格拉娅；很显然，小妹妹给她们出了一个难解的谜。ω公爵一直努力着跟叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜聊一些不相干的事，也许是为了让她散散心，结果却使她感到厌烦得不得了。她似乎完全思绪紊乱，答非所问，有时根本就不搭理。但是阿格拉娅·伊万诺夫娜今天晚上出的谜还没有完。最后一个谜则是归梅什金公爵一人份上的。在走到离别墅一百步远的地方时，阿格拉娅用很快的低语对自己这位顽固地保持沉默的男伴说：\n “您瞧瞧右边！”\n 公爵扫了一眼。\n “请注意看看。您看见公园里那张条倚没有？就在长着三棵大树的地方……绿颜色的条椅。”\n ＊法语：单独相处。\n 公爵回答说看见了。\n “您喜欢这个地方吗？有时候一大早，７点钟左右，大家还在睡觉的时候，我一个人到这儿来就坐在那里。”\n 公爵低声说这地方很优美。\n “现在您离开我走吧，我不想再跟您挽着手走了，或者最好是挽着手走，但别跟我说一句话。我想独自想想……”\n 这番告诫无论如何是多余的，即使没有吩咐，公爵一路上也肯定不会说出一个字来的。当他听了关于条椅的那些话后，他的心怦怦跳得历害。过了一会儿他才恍悟过来，并且羞愧地驱除自己的荒唐念头。\n 众所周知、至少大家都这么认为，平日聚集到帕夫洛夫斯克车站来的人，比起节日和星期天从城里涌来的“形形色色的人们”来要“高上一等”，人们的打扮虽不像过节那样，可是却很高雅。来这儿听音乐被视为一种传统。而这儿的乐队也许确实是我国花园乐队中最好的乐队，演奏的是新曲子。尽管总的来说一种充满家庭气氛、甚至显得十分亲密的景象，但人们举止得体，彬彬有礼。且人们全是来别墅避暑的人，他们到这里来互相看望。许多人是由衷地乐意这样做，而且只是为了这个目的到这儿来；但也有些人来只是为了听音乐，胡闹的事极难得发生，不过即使是平日也还是会有这类事的，没有这种事倒也是不可能的。\n 这个晚上夜色非常美妙，听众也相当多。演奏乐队附近的座位全都占满了。我们这一伙人坐在稍微靠边一点的椅子上，离车站左边的出口不远。人群和音乐多少使叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜振奋起来，也使小姐们开心；她们跟熟人中的什么人交换眼色或者从远处朝人点一下头；她们打量人们的服饰，注意一些新奇的花样，对它们评头品足，不无讥嘲地莞尔一笑。叶甫盖尼·帕大洛维奇也经常在点头致意。阿格拉娅和公爵仍然走在一起，已经有人对他们加以注意，熟识的年轻人中有人很快地走到小姐们和她们的妈妈跟前；有两三个人留下来一起交谈；所有这些人都是叶甫盖尼·帕夫洛维奇的朋友，这些人中间有一位很漂亮庸洒的年轻军官，为人活泼开朗，很善言谈；他急于跟阿格拉娅攀谈，并且竭力设法把她的注意力吸引到自己身上。阿格拉娅对他很宽厚，同时又非常爱笑，叶甫盖尼·帕夫洛维奇请公爵允许介始他跟这位好朋友认识；公爵刚刚明白要他做什么，介绍已经进行了，两人互相躬身致礼，彼此递手握了握。叶甫盖尼·帕夫洛维奇提了一个问题，但是公爵好像没有回答他或者奇怪地含糊不清地自言自语了什么，以至使得军官非常专注地看了他一回，后来又瞥了一眼叶甫盖尼·帕夫洛维奇，马上便明白了，为了什么叶甫盖尼·帕夫洛维奇想出来要介绍他们认识，他微微一笑，便又转向了阿格拉娅问。只有叶甫盖尼·帕夫洛维奇注意到，此时阿格拉娅突然脸红了。\n 公爵甚至没有注意到别人在跟阿格拉娅交谈并向她献殷勤，有片刻甚至几乎忘了，他自己正坐在她的旁边。有时他想离开到哪儿去，完全从这里消失，甚至他更喜欢有一个幽暗空寂的地方，只让他一个人呆着可以好好想想问题，不让任何人知道他在哪里。或者，至少是在自己家里，在阳台上，但是得不让任何人在那里，无论是列别杰夫还是他的孩子；他要一头扑到自己的沙发上，把脸埋在枕头里，就这样躺上一天，一夜，再一天。有几次瞬息间他的想象中浮现出山峰峦谷，一个熟悉的点恰恰在那山峦间，这是他经常喜欢回忆的地方，当年他生活在那里的时候，他喜欢去那里，从那里俯视远处的村庄，鸟瞰微微闪现的白晃晃的一线瀑布，眺望那白色的云朵，废弃的古老城堡。啊，他多么想现在就处身其间，思索一件事啊！啊，一生就只想这件事！够想上一千年的！让这里完全忘了他吧。哦，如果大家根本不知道他在哪里，而这一切幻觉仅仅只是虚梦一场，这倒更好，甚至需要这样。再说是梦还是现实还不是一样！有时候他突然开始仔细打量起阿格拉娅来，每次都有５分钟目光不高她的脸，而他的目光是过于奇怪了：他望着她好像望着一件离他两俄里远的东西一样，或者像望着她的肖像，而不是她本人。\n “干嘛您这么望着我，公爵？”她中断与周围人的愉快的谈笑，突然说、“我怕您；我老是觉碍，您想伸出手，用手指头来触摸我的脸。是这样吧，叶甫盖尼·帕夫槽维奇，他是这样看人的吧？”\n 公爵听完，似手对有人跟他说话感到惊讶，等他领悟到是这么回事，也许并不完全明白人家对他说了些什么，因此没有回答，但是、当他看到阿格拉娅和大家都在笑，便突然张开嘴巴，自己也跟着笑了起来。周围的笑声更厉害了；那位年轻军官本来就是个爱笑的人，这时憋不住而干脆扑哧一声笑出声来，阿格拉娅忽然忿忿地暗自嘀咕：\n “白痴！”\n “天哪，难道她会说这样的话……难道她真的发疯了！”叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜咬牙切齿地自语道。\n “这是开玩笑。这跟那时朗诵‘可怜的骑士’一样是玩笑，”亚历山德拉在母亲身边低话说，“不会是别的：她呀，又用她那一套来拿他寻开心了，只不过这种玩笑开得过命了：应该加以制止，妈妈，刚才她像渲泄一样简直不象样子，放纵任性地把我们吓了一大跳……”\n “幸好她碰上的是这么一个白痴，”叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲那矢娜跟她低语着。女儿的话毕竟使她轻松了些。\n 然而公爵听到了有人称他是白痴，他哆嗦了一下，但并非是因为被称为白痴、他马上就忘了“白痴”这个词。但是在人群中，就在离他坐的地方不远处，从旁边某个地方——他怎么也指不出来究竟是在什么方位，在什么地点——有一张脸一门而过，一张苍白的脸，一头卷曲的黑发，一种熟悉的、非常熟悉的微笑和目光一闪而过，随即就消逝得无影无踪。很可能这仅仅是他的想像；整个幻像留在他印象中的是冷笑，眼睛以及这位一闪即逝的先生脖子上所戴的时髦的浅绿色领带。这位先生是消失在人群中了、还是溜到车站去了，公爵也无法确定。\n 但是过了１分钟他突然迅速而又不安地开始环视周周；这第一个幻像可能是第二个幻像的预兆的先驱。这应该是可以肯定的。难道他忘了，他们到车站来是有可能相遇的？确实，当他向车站走来时，好像根本不知道他是在往这里走，他当时就是这么一种状态。如果他善于或者能够比较仔细地观察的话，那么１刻钟前他就能发现，阿格拉娅有时似乎也在不安的眨眼间环顾四周，也仿佛是在自己周围寻找什么。现在，在他的不安越来越强烈，表现得越益明显的时候，阿格拉娅的激动和不安也在增长，只要他回头张望，几乎马上她也回过头去。忐忑不安的惶惑很快就有了解答。\n 离公爵和叶潘钦家一伙人所坐的地方不远的车站最边侧的出口处，突然出现了一群人，不下十人。这一群人前面走着三个妇女；其中两人美貌惊人，因此她们后面跟着这么多崇拜者也就丝毫不足为怪了。但是，无论是崇拜者还是这几位妇人，他们都有些特别，完全不像来听音乐的其余的听众。几乎所有的人立即所发现了他们。但大部分入竭力佯装出根本没有看见他们的样子，仅有少数年轻人朝他们莞尔一笑，彼此间窃窃私议。根本不可能不看见这一群人，他们公然表现自己，大声说笑。可以料到，他们中许多人是带着醉意的，虽然从外表来看有些人穿着颇为时髦和雅致；但这里面也有些人样子相当古怪，穿的是奇装异服，一张张脸火红得奇怪；这些人中还有几个是军人；也有已非年轻的人；还有的人穿得宽松舒适，衣服做工精细，饰有袖扣，戴着嵌宝戒，套着华美的乌黑油亮的假发，蓄着连鬓胡子，脸上虽有一丝轻蔑的神情，但仍显出一副特别高贵的气派，不过社会上对这些人犹如害怕瘟神一般唯恐避之不及。在我们郊外的聚会者中间当然也有举止十分庄重，名声特别好的人士；但是最小心谨慎的人也不可能时时刻刻防范从邻屋扔下来的砖头。这块砖头现在就将掉到聚集来听首乐的体面的听众身上。\n 要从车站到乐队所在的平台必须走下三级台阶。那一群人就在这些台阶上停了下来；犹豫着要不要走下去；但是有一位女士走到前面去了，只有她的两位随从敢跟在她后面走。一个是样子相当谦恭的中年人，外表各方面很体面，但绝对是一个光棍的模样，也就是说，这种人任何时候都不认识任何人，无论谁也都不认识他们。另一个人不甘落后于自己的女士，完全衣衫褴褛，形迹可疑。再没有别的人跟在那位奇特的女士后面；但是，她在往下走时，甚至连头也不回一下，仿佛别人是否跟在她后面于她完全无所谓。她依然大声谈笑；衣着华贵而别致，但是过分华丽。她经过乐队走向平台的另一边，那里路旁有一辆马车在等什么人。\n 公爵已经有三个多月没有见到她了。来到彼得堡后所有这些日子里他一直打算到她那几去；但是，也许是一种神秘的预感阻止了他。至少他怎么也无法猜测见到她时会产生什么样的印像，而他有时候还是怀着惧怕的心情在想着，有一点他是明白的：相见将是痛苦的。在这六个月里他有好几次回忆起这个女人的脸容使他产生的最初的感受，那时他还只是看见她的肖像；但是，每当他回忆起来的时候，即使是肖像留下的印象也含着过多的痛苦。在外省那一个月，他几乎每天都与她见面，留给他的是可怕的影响，公爵有时甚至要竭力驱除对这尚为时不久的往事的回忆。对他来说，这个女人的脸上总是有一种令人痛苦的东西：在跟罗戈任谈话时，公爵把这种感受看作是无限怜悯的感受，这是真的，还是肖像上的这张脸就唤起了他心中十足痛苦和怜悯；同情甚至为这个女人痛苦的印象从来也没有离开过，现在也没有离开他的心间。哦，不，现在甚至更强烈。但是对于他跟罗戈任说的话，公爵总感到不满意；只是现在，在她突然出现的这一霎那，他才明白，也许是凭感觉，他对罗戈任说的话中还欠缺些什么。欠缺的是能够表达可怕的话；对，是可怕！现在一此刻，他完全感受到这一点了；他相信，凭自己特殊的原因完全确信，这个女人是疯了。假若在爱一个女人甚于世上的一切或者预先品尝这种爱情的可能性时，突然看见她戴着锁链镣铐在铁窗里挨着看守的棍棒，这时产生的印象就与公爵现在的感受是颇为相似的。\n “您怎么啦？”阿格拉娅打量着他，一边还故意拽了一下他的胳膊，很快地低声问。\n 他转过头来向着她，看了她一眼，瞥见了对他来说是不可理解的此刻她那闪闪发亮的黑眼睛，他试图对她莞尔一笑，但是，突然仿佛一瞬间忘了她似的，又把视线投向右边，又开始注视起自己那非同一般的芳影来。纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜这时正经过小姐们坐的椅子。叶甫盖尼·帕夫洛维奇继续在对亚历山德拉·伊万诺夫娜讲什么，大概是很可笑和有趣的事，他讲得很快，很生动，公爵记得，阿格拉娅忽然轻轻说出：“她多么……”\n 话没有说完，也就不能确定是什么意思；她一下子收住活头，再也没有补充什么，但这也已经够了。纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜正经过那里，似乎对谁也没特别注意，这时却突然转向他们这边，仿佛只是现在才发现叶甫盖尼·帕夫洛维奇。\n “哎呀，原来他在这儿！”她突然停下来惊呼道，“无论派哪个当差的都找不到，他却故意似的坐在这叫人想像不到的地方……我还以为，你是在……你伯父那里呢！”\n 叶甫盖尼·帕夫洛维奇一下子涨红了脸，怒气冲冲地看了纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜一眼，但很快他又背转过身去。\n “怎么？！难道你不知道？你们倒想想着，他竟还不知道！开枪自杀了！就在早晨你伯父开枪自杀了！我也是刚才，下午２点的时候，人家告诉的；现在半个城市的人都知道了，据说，３５万公款没有了，还有人说是５０万。可我还一直指望着他会留遗产给你；全都胡乱花光了。真是个腐化透顶的老头……好，告辞了，ｂｏｎｎｅ ｃｈａｎｃｅ＊！难道你不打算去一次？怪不得你及时告退，真是个滑头！不，这是胡说，你是知道的，早就知道了：也许，还在昨天就已知道了……”\n 虽然这种厚颜无耻的胡缠和故意夸大实际上并不存在的熟不拘礼和亲密无间肯定包含着某种目的，这一点现在已经不可能有任何疑问，但是叶甫盖尼·帕夫洛维奇起先想就这么随便敷衍过去、无论怎样都不去理会这个冤枉别人的女人。但是纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜的话犹如晴天霹雳击中了他；听到伯父的死讯，他的脸白如绢帕，转身面向带来凶讯的女人。这时叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲那关娜很快地从座位上站起身，并让大家也跟着她起来，几乎像逃跑一样离开了那里。只有列夫·尼古拉耶维奇有１秒钟还目在原地，似乎踌躇不决，还有叶甫盖尼·帕夫洛维奇也一直站着，没有恢复常态。但是叶潘钦母女尚未走开２０步，一场可怕的闹剧已经迸发开来。\n ＊法语：祝你好运！\n 叶甫盖尼·帕夫洛维奇的好朋友、才跟阿格拉娅交谈过的军官气忿到了极点。\n “实在应该用鞭子来对付她，不然什么都治不了这个贱货！”他几乎是大声地说。（他好像过去就是叶甫益尼·帕夫洛维奇信得过的人。）\n “纳斯塔西沤·费利帕夫娜一下于向他转过身来。她双眼冒火，扑向站在离她两步远地方的完全陌生的年轻人，并从他手里夺过他握着的一根编织的细鞭，用足力气朝辱骂她的人脸上斜抽了一鞭。这一切是在霎那间发生的……那军官气疯了，也向她扑去；纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜身旁的随从已经不在了，体面的中年绅士早已溜得无影无踪，而醉醺醺那一位则站在一旁开怀大笑。过一会当然警察会赶来的，但是这没有意外的帮助，纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜是会吃苦头的。公爵恰好也站在离她两步远的地方，他赶紧从后面抓住了军官的手，军官挣脱自己的手，使劲朝他的胸口一推；公爵跟踉跄跄倒退了三步，跌坐在椅子上。但是这时纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜身边又有了两名保嫖。在发动进攻的军官面前站着一个拳击手，这正是读者所知道的那篇文章的作者、罗戈任过去那一伙人中的正式成员。\n “凯勒尔！退伍中尉，”他神气活现地自我介绍着，“愿意徒手较量的话，大尉，我愿代替弱女子，悉听尊便：卑人学过全套英国式拳击。别推推掇掇，大尉；我同情您受到了流血的委屈，但是我不能允许您当着大庭广众对一个妇女动拳头。如果能像正人君子那样照另一种方式体面地行事，那么，您当然是会理解我的，大尉……”\n 但是大尉已经恍悟过来，已经不听他说了。这时从人群中出现的罗戈任迅速地抓起纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜的手，带着她跟在自己身后就走。罗戈任自己显得震惊异常，脸色苍白，打着哆嗦。他在带开纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜的时候，居然还冲着军官恶狠狠地笑了起来，并且摆出一副洋洋得意的商人模样说：\n “呸！瞧你得到了什么！脸上都挂彩了，呸！”\n 军官醒悟过来并完全猜到了在跟谁打交道，便很有礼貌地（不过，用手帕捂住了脸）转向公爵，后者已经从椅子上站了起来：\n “请问，我有幸认识的是梅什金公爵吗？”\n “她发疯了！她是个疯女人！我请您相信！”公爵不知为什么向他伸去哆嗦的双手，声音颤抖地回答说。\n “我当然不能说这样的消息是好消息；但是我应该知道您的名字，”\n 他点了一下头就走开了。在最后几位行动的人物消失以后过了５秒钟，警察赶到了。其实，这场闹剧持续了至多只有两分钟。听众中有的从椅子上站起来了，有的仅仅是从一个座位换坐到另一个座位；也有的人为看到这样的闹剧而兴奋；还有的则议论纷纷、兴致勃勃。总之，事情结束得很平常。乐队重又演奏起来。公爵跟在叶潘钦母女们后面走了。假若在人家把他推坐到椅子上的时候他能估计到或是朝左边看一下的话，那么他会看到阿格拉娅就站在离他２０步远的地方并观这一场闹剧，没有理踩已经走远的母亲和姐姐的叫唤。ω公爵跑到她跟前，终于说服了她尽快离开。叶莉扎维塔·普罗科菲耶夫娜记得，阿格拉娅回到她们那里时非常激动，因此未必听到了她们的叫唤、整整过了两分钟，她们刚刚进入公园，阿格拉娅就用她平时漫不经心和调皮的口吻说：\n “我想看看，这场闹剧怎么收场。”\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/256/2395.html","bookId":242,"book":{"id":242,"title":"白痴 The Idiot","description":"简介： The Idiot is a novel written by 19th
