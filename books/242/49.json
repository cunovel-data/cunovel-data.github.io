{"id":7428,"no":49,"title":"Part 4 Chapter 11","content":"AN hour later he was in St. Petersburg, and by ten o\u0027clock he had rung the bell at Rogojin\u0027s.\n He had gone to the front door, and was kept waiting a long while before anyone came. At last the door of old Mrs. Rogojin\u0027s flat was opened, and an aged servant appeared.\n \"Parfen Semionovitch is not at home,\" she announced from the doorway. \"Whom do you want?\"\n \"Parfen Semionovitch.\"\n \"He is not in.\"\n The old woman examined the prince from head to foot with great curiosity.\n \"At all events tell me whether he slept at home last night, and whether he came alone?\"\n The old woman continued to stare at him, but said nothing.\n \"Was not Nastasia Philipovna here with him, yesterday evening?\"\n \"And, pray, who are you yourself?\"\n \"Prince Lef Nicolaievitch Muishkin; he knows me well.\"\n \"He is not at home.\"\n The woman lowered her eyes.\n \"And Nastasia Philipovna?\"\n \"I know nothing about it.\"\n \"Stop a minute! When will he come back?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know that either.\"\n The door was shut with these words, and the old woman disappeared. The prince decided to come back within an hour. Passing out of the house, he met the porter.\n \"Is Parfen Semionovitch at home?\" he asked.\n \"Yes.\"\n \"Why did they tell me he was not at home, then?\" \"Where did they tell you so,--at his door?\" \"No, at his mother\u0027s flat; I rang at Parfen Semionovitch\u0027s door and nobody came.\"\n \"Well, he may have gone out. I can\u0027t tell. Sometimes he takes the keys with him, and leaves the rooms empty for two or three days.\"\n \"Do you know for certain that he was at home last night?\"\n \"Yes, he was.\"\n \"Was Nastasia Philipovna with him?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know; she doesn\u0027t come often. I think I should have known if she had come.\"\n The prince went out deep in thought, and walked up and down the pavement for some time. The windows of all the rooms occupied by Rogojin were closed, those of his mother\u0027s apartments were open. It was a hot, bright day. The prince crossed the road in order to have a good look at the windows again; not only were Rogojin\u0027s closed, but the white blinds were all down as well.\n He stood there for a minute and then, suddenly and strangely enough, it seemed to him that a little corner of one of the blinds was lifted, and Rogojin\u0027s face appeared for an instant and then vanished. He waited another minute, and decided to go and ring the bell once more; however, he thought better of it again and put it off for an hour.\n The chief object in his mind at this moment was to get as quickly as he could to Nastasia Philipovna\u0027s lodging. He remembered that, not long since, when she had left Pavlofsk at his request, he had begged her to put up in town at the house of a respectable widow, who had well-furnished rooms to let, near the Ismailofsky barracks. Probably Nastasia had kept the rooms when she came down to Pavlofsk this last time; and most likely she would have spent the night in them, Rogojin having taken her straight there from the station.\n The prince took a droshky. It struck him as he drove on that he ought to have begun by coming here, since it was most improbable that Rogojin should have taken Nastasia to his own house last night. He remembered that the porter said she very rarely came at all, so that it was still less likely that she would have gone there so late at night.\n Vainly trying to comfort himself with these reflections, the prince reached the Ismailofsky barracks more dead than alive.\n To his consternation the good people at the lodgings had not only heard nothing of Nastasia, but all came out to look at him as if he were a marvel of some sort. The whole family, of all ages, surrounded him, and he was begged to enter. He guessed at once that they knew perfectly well who he was, and that yesterday ought to have been his wedding-day; and further that they were dying to ask about the wedding, and especially about why he should be here now, inquiring for the woman who in all reasonable human probability might have been expected to be with him in Pavlofsk.\n He satisfied their curiosity, in as few words as possible, with regard to the wedding, but their exclamations and sighs were so numerous and sincere that he was obliged to tell the whole story-- in a short form, of course. The advice of all these agitated ladies was that the prince should go at once and knock at Rogojin\u0027s until he was let in: and when let in insist upon a substantial explanation of everything. If Rogojin was really not at home, the prince was advised to go to a certain house, the address of which was given, where lived a German lady, a friend of Nastasia Philipovna\u0027s. It was possible that she might have spent the night there in her anxiety to conceal herself.\n The prince rose from his seat in a condition of mental collapse. The good ladies reported afterwards that \"his pallor was terrible to see, and his legs seemed to give way underneath him.\" With difficulty he was made to understand that his new friends would be glad of his address, in order to act with him if possible. After a moment\u0027s thought he gave the address of the small hotel, on the stairs of which he had had a fit some five weeks since. He then set off once more for Rogojin\u0027s.\n This time they neither opened the door at Rogojin\u0027s flat nor at the one opposite. The prince found the porter with difficulty, but when found, the man would hardly look at him or answer his questions, pretending to be busy. Eventually, however, he was persuaded to reply so far as to state that Rogojin had left the house early in the morning and gone to Pavlofsk, and that he would not return today at all.\n \"I shall wait; he may come back this evening.\"\n \"He may not be home for a week.\"\n \"Then, at all events, he DID sleep here, did he?\"\n \"Well--he did sleep here, yes.\"\n All this was suspicious and unsatisfactory. Very likely the porter had received new instructions during the interval of the prince\u0027s absence; his manner was so different now. He had been obliging--now he was as obstinate and silent as a mule. However, the prince decided to call again in a couple of hours, and after that to watch the house, in case of need. His hope was that he might yet find Nastasia at the address which he had just received. To that address he now set off at full speed.\n But alas! at the German lady\u0027s house they did not even appear to understand what he wanted. After a while, by means of certain hints, he was able to gather that Nastasia must have had a quarrel with her friend two or three weeks ago, since which date the latter had neither heard nor seen anything of her. He was given to understand that the subject of Nastasia\u0027s present whereabouts was not of the slightest interest to her; and that Nastasia might marry all the princes in the world for all she cared! So Muishkin took his leave hurriedly. It struck him now that she might have gone away to Moscow just as she had done the last time, and that Rogojin had perhaps gone after her, or even WITH her. If only he could find some trace!\n However, he must take his room at the hotel; and he started off in that direction. Having engaged his room, he was asked by the waiter whether he would take dinner; replying mechanically in the affirmative, he sat down and waited; but it was not long before it struck him that dining would delay him. Enraged at this idea, he started up, crossed the dark passage (which filled him with horrible impressions and gloomy forebodings), and set out once more for Rogojin\u0027s. Rogojin had not returned, and no one came to the door. He rang at the old lady\u0027s door opposite, and was informed that Parfen Semionovitch would not return for three days. The curiosity with which the old servant stared at him again impressed the prince disagreeably. He could not find the porter this time at all.\n As before, he crossed the street and watched the windows from the other side, walking up and down in anguish of soul for half an hour or so in the stifling heat. Nothing stirred; the blinds were motionless; indeed, the prince began to think that the apparition of Rogojin\u0027s face could have been nothing but fancy. Soothed by this thought, he drove off once more to his friends at the Ismailofsky barracks. He was expected there. The mother had already been to three or four places to look for Nastasia, but had not found a trace of any kind.\n The prince said nothing, but entered the room, sat down silently, and stared at them, one after the other, with the air of a man who cannot understand what is being said to him. It was strange-- one moment he seemed to be so observant, the next so absent; his behaviour struck all the family as most remarkable. At length he rose from his seat, and begged to be shown Nastasia\u0027s rooms. The ladies reported afterwards how he had examined everything in the apartments. He observed an open book on the table, Madam Bovary, and requested the leave of the lady of the house to take it with him. He had turned down the leaf at the open page, and pocketed it before they could explain that it was a library book. He had then seated himself by the open window, and seeing a card-table, he asked who played cards.\n He was informed that Nastasia used to play with Rogojin every evening, either at \"preference\" or \"little fool,\" or \"whist\"; that this had been their practice since her last return from Pavlofsk; that she had taken to this amusement because she did not like to see Rogojin sitting silent and dull for whole evenings at a time; that the day after Nastasia had made a remark to this effect, Rogojin had whipped a pack of cards out of his pocket. Nastasia had laughed, but soon they began playing. The prince asked where were the cards, but was told that Rogojin used to bring a new pack every day, and always carried it away in his pocket.\n The good ladies recommended the prince to try knocking at Rogojin\u0027s once more--not at once, but in the evening Meanwhile, the mother would go to Pavlofsk to inquire at Dana Alexeyevna\u0027s whether anything had been heard of Nastasia there. The prince was to come back at ten o\u0027clock and meet her, to hear her news and arrange plans for the morrow.\n In spite of the kindly-meant consolations of his new friends, the prince walked to his hotel in inexpressible anguish of spirit, through the hot, dusty streets, aimlessly staring at the faces of those who passed him. Arrived at his destination, he determined to rest awhile in his room before be started for Rogojin\u0027s once more. He sat down, rested his elbows on the table and his head on his hands, and fell to thinking.\n Heaven knows how long and upon what subjects he thought. He thought of many things--of Vera Lebedeff, and of her father; of Hippolyte; of Rogojin himself, first at the funeral, then as he had met him in the park, then, suddenly, as they had met in this very passage, outside, when Rogojin had watched in the darkness and awaited him with uplifted knife. The prince remembered his enemy\u0027s eyes as they had glared at him in the darkness. He shuddered, as a sudden idea struck him.\n This idea was, that if Rogojin were in Petersburg, though he might hide for a time, yet he was quite sure to come to him--the prince--before long, with either good or evil intentions, but probably with the same intention as on that other occasion. At all events, if Rogojin were to come at all he would be sure to seek the prince here--he had no other town address--perhaps in this same corridor; he might well seek him here if he needed him. And perhaps he did need him. This idea seemed quite natural to the prince, though he could not have explained why he should so suddenly have become necessary to Rogojin. Rogojin would not come if all were well with him, that was part of the thought; he would come if all were not well; and certainly, undoubtedly, all would not be well with him. The prince could not bear this new idea; he took his hat and rushed out towards the street. It was almost dark in the passage.\n \"What if he were to come out of that corner as I go by and--and stop me?\" thought the prince, as he approached the familiar spot. But no one came out.\n He passed under the gateway and into the street. The crowds of people walking about--as is always the case at sunset in Petersburg, during the summer--surprised him, but he walked on in the direction of Rogojin\u0027s house.\n About fifty yards from the hotel, at the first cross-road, as he passed through the crowd of foot-passengers sauntering along, someone touched his shoulder, and said in a whisper into his ear:\n \"Lef Nicolaievitch, my friend, come along with me.\" It was Rogojin.\n The prince immediately began to tell him, eagerly and joyfully, how he had but the moment before expected to see him in the dark passage of the hotel.\n \"I was there,\" said Rogojin, unexpectedly. \"Come along.\" The prince was surprised at this answer; but his astonishment increased a couple of minutes afterwards, when he began to consider it. Having thought it over, he glanced at Rogojin in alarm. The latter was striding along a yard or so ahead, looking straight in front of him, and mechanically making way for anyone he met.\n \"Why did you not ask for me at my room if you were in the hotel?\" asked the prince, suddenly.\n Rogojin stopped and looked at him; then reflected, and replied as though he had not heard the question:\n \"Look here, Lef Nicolaievitch, you go straight on to the house; I shall walk on the other side. See that we keep together.\"\n So saying, Rogojin crossed the road.\n Arrived on the opposite pavement, he looked back to see whether the prince were moving, waved his hand in the direction of the Gorohovaya, and strode on, looking across every moment to see whether Muishkin understood his instructions. The prince supposed that Rogojin desired to look out for someone whom he was afraid to miss; but if so, why had he not told HIM whom to look out for? So the two proceeded for half a mile or so. Suddenly the prince began to tremble from some unknown cause. He could not bear it, and signalled to Rogojin across the road.\n The latter came at once.\n \"Is Nastasia Philipovna at your house?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"And was it you looked out of the window under the blind this morning?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"Then why did--\"\n But the prince could not finish his question; he did not know what to say. Besides this, his heart was beating so that he found it difficult to speak at all. Rogojin was silent also and looked at him as before, with an expression of deep thoughtfulness.\n \"Well, I\u0027m going,\" he said, at last, preparing to recross the road. \"You go along here as before; we will keep to different sides of the road; it\u0027s better so, you\u0027ll see.\"\n When they reached the Gorohovaya, and came near the house, the prince\u0027s legs were trembling so that he could hardly walk. It was about ten o\u0027clock. The old lady\u0027s windows were open, as before; Rogojin\u0027s were all shut, and in the darkness the white blinds showed whiter than ever. Rogojin and the prince each approached the house on his respective side of the road; Rogojin, who was on the near side, beckoned the prince across. He went over to the doorway.\n \"Even the porter does not know that I have come home now. I told him, and told them at my mother\u0027s too, that I was off to Pavlofsk,\" said Rogojin, with a cunning and almost satisfied smile. \"We\u0027ll go in quietly and nobody will hear us.\"\n He had the key in his hand. Mounting the staircase he turned and signalled to the prince to go more softly; he opened the door very quietly, let the prince in, followed him, locked the door behind him, and put the key in his pocket.\n \"Come along,\" he whispered.\n He had spoken in a whisper all the way. In spite of his apparent outward composure, he was evidently in a state of great mental agitation. Arrived in a large salon, next to the study, he went to the window and cautiously beckoned the prince up to him.\n \"When you rang the bell this morning I thought it must be you. I went to the door on tip-toe and heard you talking to the servant opposite. I had told her before that if anyone came and rang-- especially you, and I gave her your name--she was not to tell about me. Then I thought, what if he goes and stands opposite and looks up, or waits about to watch the house? So I came to this very window, looked out, and there you were staring straight at me. That\u0027s how it came about.\"\n \"Where is Nastasia Philipovna?\" asked the prince, breathlessly.\n \"She\u0027s here,\" replied Rogojin, slowly, after a slight pause.\n \"Where?\"\n Rogojin raised his eyes and gazed intently at the prince.\n \"Come,\" he said.\n He continued to speak in a whisper, very deliberately as before, and looked strangely thoughtful and dreamy. Even while he told the story of how he had peeped through the blind, he gave the impression of wishing to say something else. They entered the study. In this room some changes had taken place since the prince last saw it. It was now divided into two equal parts by a heavy green silk curtain stretched across it, separating the alcove beyond, where stood Rogojin\u0027s bed, from the rest of the room.\n The heavy curtain was drawn now, and it was very dark. The bright Petersburg summer nights were already beginning to close in, and but for the full moon, it would have been difficult to distinguish anything in Rogojin\u0027s dismal room, with the drawn blinds. They could just see one anothers faces, however, though not in detail. Rogojin\u0027s face was white, as usual. His glittering eyes watched the prince with an intent stare.\n \"Had you not better light a candle?\" said Muishkin.\n \"No, I needn\u0027t,\" replied Rogojin, and taking the other by the hand he drew him down to a chair. He himself took a chair opposite and drew it up so close that he almost pressed against the prince\u0027s knees. At their side was a little round table.\n Sit down,\" said Rogojin; \"let\u0027s rest a bit.\" There was silence for a moment.\n \"I knew you would be at that hotel,\" he continued, just as men sometimes commence a serious conversation by discussing any outside subject before leading up to the main point. \"As I entered the passage it struck me that perhaps you were sitting and waiting for me, just as I was waiting for you. Have you been to the old lady at Ismailofsky barracks?\"\n \"Yes,\" said the prince, squeezing the word out with difficulty owing to the dreadful beating of his heart.\n \"I thought you would. \u0027They\u0027ll talk about it,\u0027 I thought; so I determined to go and fetch you to spend the night here--\u0027We will be together,\u0027 I thought, \u0027for this one night--\u0027\"\n \"Rogojin, WHERE is Nastasia Philipovna?\" said the prince, suddenly rising from his seat. He was quaking in all his limbs, and his words came in a scarcely audible whisper. Rogojin rose also.\n \"There,\" he whispered, nodding his head towards the curtain.\n \"Asleep?\" whispered the prince.\n Rogojin looked intently at him again, as before.\n \"Let\u0027s go in--but you mustn\u0027t--well--let\u0027s go in.\"\n He lifted the curtain, paused--and turned to the prince. \"Go in,\" he said, motioning him to pass behind the curtain. Muishkin went in.\n It\u0027s so dark,\" he said.\n \"You can see quite enough,\" muttered Rogojin.\n \"I can just see there\u0027s a bed--\"\n \"Go nearer,\" suggested Rogojin, softly.\n The prince took a step forward--then another--and paused. He stood and stared for a minute or two.\n All around, on the bed, on a chair beside it, on the floor, were scattered the different portions of a magnificent white silk dress, bits of lace, ribbons and flowers. On a small table at the bedside glittered a mass of diamonds, torn off and thrown down anyhow. From under a heap of lace at the end of the bed peeped a small white foot, which looked as though it had been chiselled out of marble; it was terribly still.\n The prince gazed and gazed, and felt that the more he gazed the more death-like became the silence. Suddenly a fly awoke somewhere, buzzed across the room, and settled on the pillow. The prince shuddered.\n \"Let\u0027s go,\" said Rogojin, touching his shoulder. They left the alcove and sat down in the two chairs they had occupied before, opposite to one another. The prince trembled more and more violently, and never took his questioning eyes off Rogojin\u0027s face.\n \"I see you are shuddering, Lef Nicolaievitch,\" said the latter, at length, \"almost as you did once in Moscow, before your fit; don\u0027t you remember? I don\u0027t know what I shall do with you--\"\n The prince bent forward to listen, putting all the strain he could muster upon his understanding in order to take in what Rogojin said, and continuing to gaze at the latter\u0027s face.\n \"Was it you?\" he muttered, at last, motioning with his head towards the curtain.\n \"Yes, it was I,\" whispered Rogojin, looking down.\n Neither spoke for five minutes.\n \"Because, you know,\" Rogojin recommenced, as though continuing a former sentence, \"if you were ill now, or had a fit, or screamed, or anything, they might hear it in the yard, or even in the street, and guess that someone was passing the night in the house. They would all come and knock and want to come in, because they know I am not at home. I didn\u0027t light a candle for the same reason. When I am not here--for two or three days at a time, now and then--no one comes in to tidy the house or anything; those are my orders. So that I want them to not know we are spending the night here--\"\n \"Wait,\" interrupted the prince. \"I asked both the porter and the woman whether Nastasia Philipovna had spent last night in the house; so they knew--\"\n \"I know you asked. I told them that she had called in for ten minutes, and then gone straight back to Pavlofsk. No one knows she slept here. Last night we came in just as carefully as you and I did today. I thought as I came along with her that she would not like to creep in so secretly, but I was quite wrong. She whispered, and walked on tip-toe; she carried her skirt over her arm, so that it shouldn\u0027t rustle, and she held up her finger at me on the stairs, so that I shouldn\u0027t make a noise--it was you she was afraid of. She was mad with terror in the train, and she begged me to bring her to this house. I thought of taking her to her rooms at the Ismailofsky barracks first; but she wouldn\u0027t hear of it. She said, \u0027No--not there; he\u0027ll find me out at once there. Take me to your own house, where you can hide me, and tomorrow we\u0027ll set off for Moscow.\u0027 Thence she would go to Orel, she said. When she went to bed, she was still talking about going to Orel.\"\n \"Wait! What do you intend to do now, Parfen?\"\n \"Well, I\u0027m afraid of you. You shudder and tremble so. We\u0027ll pass the night here together. There are no other beds besides that one; but I\u0027ve thought how we\u0027ll manage. I\u0027ll take the cushions off all the sofas, and lay them down on the floor, up against the curtain here--for you and me--so that we shall be together. For if they come in and look about now, you know, they\u0027ll find her, and carry her away, and they\u0027ll be asking me questions, and I shall say I did it, and then they\u0027ll take me away, too, don\u0027t you see? So let her lie close to us--close to you and me.\n \"Yes, yes,\" agreed the prince, warmly.\n \"So we will not say anything about it, or let them take her away?\"\n \"Not for anything!\" cried the other; \"no, no, no!\"\n \"So I had decided, my friend; not to give her up to anyone,\" continued Rogojin. \"We\u0027ll be very quiet. I have only been out of the house one hour all day, all the rest of the time I have been with her. I dare say the air is very bad here. It is so hot. Do you find it bad?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know--perhaps--by morning it will be.\"\n \"I\u0027ve covered her with oil-cloth--best American oilcloth, and put the sheet over that, and four jars of disinfectant, on account of the smell--as they did at Moscow--you remember? And she\u0027s lying so still; you shall see, in the morning, when it\u0027s light. What! can\u0027t you get up?\" asked Rogojin, seeing the other was trembling so that he could not rise from his seat.\n \"My legs won\u0027t move,\" said the prince; \"it\u0027s fear, I know. When my fear is over, I\u0027ll get up--\"\n \"Wait a bit--I\u0027ll make the bed, and you can lie down. I\u0027ll lie down, too, and we\u0027ll listen and watch, for I don\u0027t know yet what I shall do... I tell you beforehand, so that you may be ready in case I--\"\n Muttering these disconnected words, Rogojin began to make up the beds. It was clear that he had devised these beds long before; last night he slept on the sofa. But there was no room for two on the sofa, and he seemed anxious that he and the prince should be close to one another; therefore, he now dragged cushions of all sizes and shapes from the sofas, and made a sort of bed of them close by the curtain. He then approached the prince, and gently helped him to rise, and led him towards the bed. But the prince could now walk by himself, so that his fear must have passed; for all that, however, he continued to shudder.\n \"It\u0027s hot weather, you see,\" continued Rogojin, as he lay down on the cushions beside Muishkin, \"and, naturally, there will be a smell. I daren\u0027t open the window. My mother has some beautiful flowers in pots; they have a delicious scent; I thought of fetching them in, but that old servant will find out, she\u0027s very inquisitive.\n \"Yes, she is inquisitive,\" assented the prince.\n \"I thought of buying flowers, and putting them all round her; but I was afraid it would make us sad to see her with flowers round her.\"\n \"Look here,\" said the prince; he was bewildered, and his brain wandered. He seemed to be continually groping for the questions he wished to ask, and then losing them. \"Listen--tell me--how did you--with a knife?--That same one?\"\n \"Yes, that same one.\"\n \"Wait a minute, I want to ask you something else, Parfen; all sorts of things; but tell me first, did you intend to kill her before my wedding, at the church door, with your knife?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know whether I did or not,\" said Rogojin, drily, seeming to be a little astonished at the question, and not quite taking it in.\n \"Did you never take your knife to Pavlofsk with you?\" \"No. As to the knife,\" he added, \"this is all I can tell you about it.\" He was silent for a moment, and then said, \"I took it out of the locked drawer this morning about three, for it was in the early morning all this--happened. It has been inside the book ever since--and--and--this is what is such a marvel to me, the knife only went in a couple of inches at most, just under her left breast, and there wasn\u0027t more than half a tablespoonful of blood altogether, not more.\"\n \"Yes--yes--yes--\" The prince jumped up in extraordinary agitation. \"I know, I know, I\u0027ve read of that sort of thing--it\u0027s internal haemorrhage, you know. Sometimes there isn\u0027t a drop--if the blow goes straight to the heart--\"\n \"Wait--listen!\" cried Rogojin, suddenly, starting up. \"Somebody\u0027s walking about, do you hear? In the hall.\" Both sat up to listen.\n \"I hear,\" said the prince in a whisper, his eyes fixed on Rogojin.\n \"Footsteps?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"Shall we shut the door, and lock it, or not?\"\n \"Yes, lock it.\"\n They locked the door, and both lay down again. There was a long silence.\n \"Yes, by-the-by,\" whispered the prince, hurriedly and excitedly as before, as though he had just seized hold of an idea and was afraid of losing it again. \"I--I wanted those cards! They say you played cards with her?\"\n \"Yes, I played with her,\" said Rogojin, after a short silence.\n \"Where are the cards?\"\n \"Here they are,\" said Rogojin, after a still longer pause.\n He pulled out a pack of cards, wrapped in a bit of paper, from his pocket, and handed them to the prince. The latter took them, with a sort of perplexity. A new, sad, helpless feeling weighed on his heart; he had suddenly realized that not only at this moment, but for a long while, he had not been saying what he wanted to say, had not been acting as he wanted to act; and that these cards which he held in his hand, and which he had been so delighted to have at first, were now of no use--no use... He rose, and wrung his hands. Rogojin lay motionless, and seemed neither to hear nor see his movements; but his eyes blazed in the darkness, and were fixed in a wild stare.\n The prince sat down on a chair, and watched him in alarm. Half an hour went by.\n Suddenly Rogojin burst into a loud abrupt laugh, as though he had quite forgotten that they must speak in whispers.\n \"That officer, eh!--that young officer--don\u0027t you remember that fellow at the band? Eh? Ha, ha, ha! Didn\u0027t she whip him smartly, eh?\"\n The prince jumped up from his seat in renewed terror. When Rogojin quieted down (which he did at once) the prince bent over him, sat down beside him, and with painfully beating heart and still more painful breath, watched his face intently. Rogojin never turned his head, and seemed to have forgotten all about him. The prince watched and waited. Time went on--it began to grow light.\n Rogojin began to wander--muttering disconnectedly; then he took to shouting and laughing. The prince stretched out a trembling hand and gently stroked his hair and his cheeks--he could do nothing more. His legs trembled again and he seemed to have lost the use of them. A new sensation came over him, filling his heart and soul with infinite anguish.\n Meanwhile the daylight grew full and strong; and at last the prince lay down, as though overcome by despair, and laid his face against the white, motionless face of Rogojin. His tears flowed on to Rogojin\u0027s cheek, though he was perhaps not aware of them himself.\n At all events when, after many hours, the door was opened and people thronged in, they found the murderer unconscious and in a raging fever. The prince was sitting by him, motionless, and each time that the sick man gave a laugh, or a shout, he hastened to pass his own trembling hand over his companion\u0027s hair and cheeks, as though trying to soothe and quiet him. But alas I he understood nothing of what was said to him, and recognized none of those who surrounded him.\n If Schneider himself had arrived then and seen his former pupil and patient, remembering the prince\u0027s condition during the first year in Switzerland, he would have flung up his hands, despairingly, and cried, as he did then:\n \"An idiot!\"\n \n 过了１小时他已经在彼得堡，９点钟时则已按罗戈任的门铃了。他是从正门进去的，好久都没有给他开里面的门。最后，罗戈任娜老太婆房间的门开了，出现一个仪表端庄的老女仆。\n “帕尔芬·谢苗诺维奇不在家，”她从问里边说，“您找谁？”\n “帕尔芬·谢苗诺维奇。”\n “他不在家。”\n 女仆用一种怪异的好奇目光打量公爵。\n “至少请告诉我，他是否在家里过夜？还有……昨天他是不是一个人回来的？”\n 女仆继续望着他，但不做回答。\n “昨天晚上……纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜没有跟他一起……在这里？”\n “请间，你是什么人？”\n “列夫·尼古接耶维奇·梅什金公爵，我们非常熟悉。”\n “他不在家。”\n 女仆垂下了眼睛。\n “那么纳斯塔西娅。费利帕夫娜呢？”\n “这我一点也不知道。”\n “请等一下，等一下！他什么时候回来？”\n “这也不知道。”\n 关门上了。\n 公爵决定过１小时再来，他朝院子看了一眼，他遇见了管院子人。\n “帕尔芬·谢苗诺维奇在家吗？”\n “在家。”\n “那刚才怎么对我说不在家？”\n “他家里人说的？”\n “不，是他母亲的女仆说的，而我按帕尔芬·谢苗诺维奇的门铃，没有人来开门。”\n “也许出去了，”管院子人说，“他可是不告诉的。有时连钥匙也随身带走，房间常常一锁就是三天。”\n “您肯定知道昨天他在家吗？”\n “在家。有时他从正门走，那就看不到了。”\n “那么昨天纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜跟他在一起吗？”\n “这可不知道。她不常来，要是她来，好象我是会知道的。”\n 公爵走了出来，在人行道上沉思徘徊了一阵。罗戈任住的几间房间的窗户全部关着，他母亲占着的那一半房间的窗户全都开着。天气晴朗、炎热。公爵穿过街来到对面人行道上，停下来又朝窗户瞥了一眼：它们不仅仅全都关着，而且几乎到处都放下了白色的窗幔。\n 他站了有１分钟左右，奇怪的是，突然他觉得，有一个窗幔的边撩开了一点，闪过罗戈任的脸，闪了一下，一瞬而逝。他又等了一会，本已决定再去按门铃，但改变了主意，决定推迟１小时：“谁知道，也许只是幻觉……”\n 主要的是，他现在急着要去伊斯梅洛夫团，即纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜不久前往过的宅寓。他知道，三星期前按他的请求她从帕夫洛夫斯克搬走，住到伊斯梅洛夫团一位过去要好的熟人、寡居的教师妻子、有家的受人尊敬的女士那里，她几乎靠出租一套有上好家具的房间为生。最大的可能是，纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜又搬到帕夫洛夫斯克去住时，留下了这套住宅；至少相当可能在这住宅里过夜，当然，是罗戈任昨天把她送往那里的。公爵雇了马车。途中他忽然想到，应该先从这里开始找起，因为夜里她不可能径直上罗戈任那儿去。这时他又想起管院子人的话，纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜不常去。既然本来就不常去，现在又凭什么在罗戈任那里留宿呢？公爵因这些想法而有所宽慰，使自己打起精神来，最后，半死不活地来到了伊斯梅洛夫团。\n 完全使他吃惊的是，教师妻子这里无论是昨天还是今天都没有听说过纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜的事，不仅如此，她家里的人跑出来像看怪物似的看着他，教师妻子家庭成员众多——全是年龄相差１岁的女孩，从１５岁到７岁——她们跟在母亲身后蜂拥而出，把他团团围住，对着他张大嘴巴瞪着。在她们后面走出来一位脸色蜡黄、精瘦干瘪、扎着黑头巾的姑姑，最后露面的是奶奶，戴眼镜的老太太。教师妻子非常恳切请公爵进去坐坐，他就照做了。他马上就意识到，她们完全明白他是什么人，她们也清楚地知道，昨天应是她的婚礼，她们想要了解婚礼的情形想得要死，也极想了解目前的怪事：怎么他向她们打听起她来，她现在本应该跟他在帕夫洛夫斯克而不是跟别人在一起，但是她们都知礼识趣。公爵简短地谈了婚礼的事以满足她们的好奇心。她们便开始惊诧）叹气和呼叫，于是公爵不得不把其余的一切几乎都讲了，当然，只是择其要者。最后这儿位聪颖激动的女士商议决定，首先一定要敲开罗戈任的门，并从他那里了解到一切肯定的情况。如果他不在家（这点一定得弄清楚）或者他不想说，那么就去谢苗诺夫团一位女士那里，是个德国人，她是纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜的熟人，与母亲一起住：也许，纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜因为激动不安和想躲起来，就在她们那里过夜了。公爵起身告辞时十分沮丧。她们后来说，他脸色“白得可怕”；确实，他几乎两腿发软。最后，在一片吵得不得了的叽哩哇啦声中他听出了，她们商量着要与他一起行动，并向他要城里的地址。他没有地址；她们建议他住旅馆。公爵想了一下，便把五星期前他曾经在那里发过病的、过去住过的旅馆地址给了她们。接着他又去找罗戈任。这一次罗戈任那里不仅不开门，甚至老太婆住的宅院门也没开。公爵去找管院子人，好不容易在院子里找到他；管院子人正忙着什么事，因此勉强回着话，甚至勉强看看他，但还是肯定地说，帕尔芬·谢苗诺维奇“一大清早就出去了，去帕夫洛夫斯克了，今天不会回家。”\n “我等一等，也许，晚上会回来。”\n “也许，一星期都不回来，谁知道他。”\n “这么说，反正昨天是在家过夜的。”\n “过夜是过夜的……”\n 所有这一切是令人怀疑的，有鬼名堂。管院子人很可能在这段时间里得到了新的指示，因为刚才还相当多话，而现在简直就是避而不答。但是公爵决定过两小时再来，如果必要的活，甚至就守在门旁。而现在还剩下在德国女人那里的希望，于是他驱车去谢苗诺夫团。\n 但是在德国女人那里她们甚至不理解他的来意。从她透露的一些话中公爵甚至领悟到，德国美人两星期前与纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜吵了一架，因此这些日子来她一点也没听说纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜的事，而且现在她竭力要人家知道，她也没有兴趣去听说，“哪怕她嫁给世界上所有的公爵。”公爵急忙走出来。他忽然想到，也许她像那时那样去莫斯科了，而罗戈任当然是追踪而去，也可能是与她一起去。“至少哪怕找到一点踪迹也好！”但是他想起了，他应该在旅馆落脚，便急忙去季捷伊纳亚街，那里立即带他到一个房间去，服务员问他想不想吃点东西，他心不在焉地回答说要，待到醒悟过来，他对自己大发了一通火，因为吃东西耽误了他十小时，只是后来他才明白，他完全可以留下送来的点心，可以不吃。在这昏暗窒闷的走廊里有一种奇怪的感觉，苦苦地竭力要得到某个想法的感觉笼罩着他的心头，但他总是领悟不到，这个新的纠缠不休的想法究竟是什么。最后他魂不守舍地从旅馆里走出来；他的脑袋在打转，但是，到底上哪儿去呢？他又去找罗戈任。\n 罗戈任没有回来，没人开门应铃声。他又去找罗戈任娜老太婆宅院的铃，门开了，也声称帕尔芬·谢苗诺维奇不在，也许三天都不在。使公爵感到很窘的是，像以前那样，人们用怪异好奇的目光打量他。这次他根本未能找到管院子人。像刚才那样他走到对面人行道上，望着罗戈任家的窗户，在难熬的炎热中徘徊了半小时左右，也许时间还更长些。但这次什么也没动静；窗户没有打开，白色窗幄纹丝不动。他最终认为，刚才一定是他的幻觉，因为从一切迹象看来，甚至窗户也黯然无光，久未擦洗，因此，即使有人真的透过窗户张望，也很难辨认。这个想法使他感到高兴，于是他又到伊斯梅洛夫团教师妻子家去。\n 那里她们已经在等他了。教师妻子已经到过三四个地方，甚至还去过罗戈任家，那里无声无息。公爵一声不吭听着，走进房间，坐到沙发上，望着大家，似乎不明白她们在对他讲什么。奇怪的是：他一会儿注意力异常敏锐，一会儿又忽然心不在焉到难以置信的地步。这一家人后来称，这一天这个人奇怪得“令人吃惊”，因此，“也许，那时一切就已经显示出来了。”最后，他站起来，请求给他看看纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜的房间。这是两间宽敞高大而又明亮的房间，有着相当好的价值不低的家具。这几位女士后来说，公爵察看了房间里的每一样东西，看见了茶几上有一本从图书馆借来的书推开着，是法国长篇小说《包法利夫人》。他注意到了，把打开的那一页折了起来，请求允许把书带走，而且没有听完说出是从图书馆借来的就立即把它放到自己口袋里。他坐到打开的窗口，看见一张写满了粉笔字的小牌桌，便问：谁在玩牌？他们告诉他，每天晚上纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜都与罗戈任打杜拉克，朴列费兰斯，梅利尼克，惠斯特，自选王牌等各种牌戏，只是最近，即从帕夫洛夫斯克搬来彼得堡以后，才开始玩牌的，因为纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜老是抱怨无聊，罗戈任整晚整晚坐着；老不吭声，什么也不会说，而她常常哭泣；于是突然有一天晚上罗戈后从口袋里掏出了纸牌；纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜立即笑逐颜开，他们就开始玩起牌来。公爵问，他们玩的牌在哪里？但是牌不在，总是由罗戈任自己放在口袋里带来，每天都是一副新纸牌，用后就随身带走。\n 这几位女士建议公爵再去罗戈任家，把门敲重些，但不是现在，而是晚上，因为那时“也许会在”。与此同时教师妻子自告奋勇在天黑前去一趟帕夫洛夫斯克找达里娅·阿列克谢耶夫娜，打听一下那边是否知道什么情况。她们请公爵晚上１０点钟无论如何去她们那儿，以便商量第二天的行动。尽管她们一再安慰和给以希望，公爵心头仍充满了绝望；在难以形容的苦恼中他步行回到自己的旅馆。夏日尘土飞扬、窒闷难受的彼得堡仿佛像钳子似地把他夹得喘不过气来：他在冷峻的或喝醉了酒的人群中挤来挤去，无目的地盯着人们的脸，他走过的路大概比应走的路多得多；当他走进自己房间的时候，天几乎已经完全黑了。他决定稍事休息，然后如她们建议的那样再到罗戈任那儿去。公爵坐到沙发上，双肘撑在桌子上，陷入了沉思。\n 上帝知道，他想了多久，也只有上帝知道，他想了些什么。他担心许多事情，并且痛苦和难受地感觉到了自己非常害怕。他想到了维拉·列别杰娃；后来又想到，也许，列别杰夫知道这件事的什么情况，即使他不知道，那么也可能比他更快更容易地了解到。后来他又回忆起伊波利特以及罗戈任常去看伊波利特的事。再后来则想起了罗戈任本人：不久前在安魂弥撒上，接着在公园里，接着——突然在这里走廊上，当时他躲地角落里，手持刀等着他。现在他也回忆起了他的眼睛，当时在黑暗中窥视着的眼睛。他颤栗了一下：刚才纠缠不休的念头现在突然冒了出来。\n 这个念头在某种程度上是这样的：如果罗戈任在彼得堡，那么尽管他要隐藏一段时间，最后反正一定会来找他公爵的，就像过去那样，无论他抱有好的还是坏的意图，总会来找他的。至少，假如罗戈任有什么原因必须要来，那么除了到这里，又是这条走廊外，他再没有别的去处。他不知道公爵的地址，因而很可能会想到公爵住在过去的旅馆里，至少他会试图在这里寻找他……如果非常必要的话，可谁又知道呢，也许，他是很有必要呢？\n 他这么想，而且这个念头不知为什么使他觉得完全是可能的。假若他开始深入考虑自己的想法，比如说，为什么罗戈任突然这样需要他？为什么他们最终一定要相见？他无论如何是弄不清楚的。但是这个想法却沉重地压在心头。“如果他很好，他就不会来，”公爵继续想，“如果他觉得不好，他多半会来；而他肯定是觉得不好的……”\n 当然，既然他这样确信，就应该在旅馆房间里等罗戈任；但是他又仿佛不能承受这种新的想法。便一跃而起，抓起了帽子就往外跑。走道里几乎之经完全黑了。“如果他现在突然从那个角落里走出来并在楼梯旁拦住我，怎么办？”当他走近他所熟悉的地方时，忽然闪过这样的念头。但是没有人走出来。他下楼走近大门，走到人行道上。使他感到惊诧的是，密密麻麻的人群伴随着西下的夕阳涌上街道。（假期的彼得堡总是这样）。他朝豌豆街方向走去。在离旅馆５０步远的地方，在第一个十字路口，人群中突然有人碰了一下他的胳膊）凑在他耳旁低声说：\n “列夫·尼古拉耶维奇，跟我走吧，兄弟，有必要。”\n 这是罗戈任。\n 很奇怪：公爵出于高兴突然开始嘟嘟哝哝地对他说（几乎每句话都没有说到底），他刚才去旅馆走廊里等过他。\n “我去过那里，”罗戈任出其不意地回答说，“我们走吧。”\n 公爵对他的回答很惊讶，但是，至少过了两分钟后他弄清楚了才真正惊讶了，弄清楚这句答话的会意后，公爵吓坏了，开始仔细端详起罗戈任来。罗戈任在前面半步远的地方走着，笔直望着前方，对迎面而来的任何人不望一眼，下意识小心翼翼地给所有的行人让路。\n “既然你到了旅馆，为什么不到房间里来找我？”公爵突然问道。\n 罗戈任停下来，望了他一眼，又想了想，仿佛完全不明白他的问话似的，说：\n “这样吧，列夫·尼古拉耶维奇，你在这里笔直走，一直走到家，知道吗？我则要在那一边走。你得注意，我们要保持在一起……”\n 说完，他穿过街道，走上对面的人行道，又看了一下公爵是否在走，当他看见公爵站在那里睁大了眼睛望着他时，便对他朝豌豆街方向挥了一下手，就开步走了，不时地转身看一下公爵，要他跟上自己。他看到公爵明白了他的意思，没有从另一边人行道走到他这边来，他显然很高兴。而公爵则想，罗戈任需要仔细观察并不放过路上的什么人，因此他要走到另一边人行道上去。“只不过为什么他不说一声要看谁？”就这样他们走了５００步光景，突然公爵不知为什么开始浑身打颤；罗戈任虽然比刚才少看他，但仍然不停地回头。公爵忍不住便向他招招手。罗戈任马上穿过街朝他走来。\n “难道纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜在你那里？”\n “在我那里。”\n “刚才是你从窗幔后面看我？”\n “是我……”\n “你怎么……”\n 但是公爵不知道接下去问什么和怎么结束问话；加上他的心跳得厉害，说话也觉得困难。罗戈任也沉默着，还像先前那样望着他，也就是仿佛若有所思地望着。\n “好了，我走了。”他突然说，准备再穿过街去。“你走你自己的，我们就在街上分开走吧……这样我们会觉得好些……各走一边……你会明白的。”\n 终于，他们从不同的人行道都拐向豌豆街并走近了罗戈任的家，公爵又开始双腿发软了，以致几乎难以行走。已经是晚上１０点左右了。老大婆那一半窗户像刚才那样开着，而罗戈任那里的窗户关着，而且在昏暗的夜色中垂下的白色窗幔变得格外醒目。公爵从对面人行道走近屋子；罗戈任则从自己这边人行道走上台阶并朝他挥手。公爵穿过街走向他，登上了台阶。\n “现在管院子人也不知道我回家了。我刚才说去帕夫洛夫斯克，在母亲那里也这么说，”他脸带狡猾而得意的微笑低声说，“我们进去，谁也听不见我们的声音。”\n 他的手里已经拿好钥匙。上搂梯时，他转过身来，警告公爵，让他走得轻些。他悄悄地开了自己房间的门，放公爵进去，然后小心翼翼地跟在他后面进去，并在身后关上门，把钥匙放进口袋。\n “我们往前走，”他悄声低语说。\n 还是在季捷伊纳亚街的人行道上时他说起话来就是悄声低语的。尽管他外表非常镇静，但是内心却深深不安。当他们走进紧靠着书房的厅堂时，他走近窗口并神秘地招呼公爵走到自己身边来。\n “你刚才打铃找我，我在这里马上就猜到这是你本人；我踮着脚走近门边，听到你在跟帕夫季耶夫娜谈话，而我在天刚亮的时候就吩咐过她：如果是你或者是你派的人，或者无论什么人来敲我的门，不管怎么样也不能说我在家；特别要是你自己来问我的去处，更不能说，我还告诉她你的名字，后来，你走出去了，我忽然想到，要是你现在站在那里，从街上察看或者守着呢？于是我就走到这扇窗跟前，撩开窗幔望了一下，而你站在那里正朝我望着……就是这么回事。”\n “纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜……在什么地方？”公爵喘着气说。\n “她……在这里，”罗戈任慢腾腾地说，似乎稍稍等了一会才回答。\n “在哪里？”\n 罗戈任抬眼望着公爵，凝神地望着他。\n “我们走……”\n 他一直低语音，而且不急不忙，慢条斯理，仍像先前那样，似乎奇怪地若有所思着。甚至在讲掀起窗幔的事候，也仿佛是在讲别的事似的，尽管他讲的时候十分冲动。\n 他们走进书房，从公爵上次到过这里以来，这个房间里发生了一些变化：一道绿色花缎丝幔帘横穿整个房间（两端各有一个出入口，把书房和放着罗戈任床铺的凹室隔了开来。沉重的幔帘垂下着，入口也都关着。但是房间里很暗；彼得堡夏日的白夜也开始变得昏暗，因此若是没有满月，在罗戈任放下窗幔的幽暗的房间里是难以看清楚什么的。确实，还能辨认人的脸，但很模糊。罗戈任照例脸色苍白：眼睛凝视着公爵，特别闪亮，但似乎定定呆呆的。\n “你哪怕点支蜡烛？”公爵说。\n “不，不用，”罗戈任回答着，挽起公爵的手，把他按到椅子上；他自己移过一把椅子在公爵对面坐下，近得几乎碰着膝盖。他们之间稍稍靠边的地方有一张小园桌。“坐吧，暂时先坐一会！”他说，仿佛在劝对方坐些时候。他们沉默了一会。“我就知道，你会在这家旅馆落脚的，”他说起话来，正像有的时候那样，在谈主要的话题前，先从与正题没有直接关系的局外细节开始谈起，“我走进走廊，就想：也许，他现在正坐着等我，就像此刻我等他一样。你去过教师妻子家了？”\n “去过，”由于剧烈的心跳，公爵勉强才能说出话来。\n “我就想到过这点，我想，还是有话要谈的……后来还想：我带他来这里过夜吧，这样今天夜里就可以一起……”\n “罗戈任！纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜在哪里？”公爵突然低声说，并浑身上下打着颤，站了起来，罗戈任也站起身。\n “在那里，”他朝幔帘那边点了下头，低语说。\n “她睡了？”公爵低声问。\n 罗戈任又像刚才那样凝神望了他一眼。\n “还是走过去吧！……只不过你……算了，走吧！”\n 他撩起入口的门帘，停下来，又转向公爵说。\n “进来！”他朝门帘后面点点头，请公爵朝前走。公爵走了进去。\n “这里很暗，”他说。\n “看得见！”罗戈任喁喁说。\n “我勉强看得见……一张床。”\n “走近些，”罗戈任轻轻地提议说。\n 公爵又跨近了一步，两步，停住了。他站在那里，细看了一分钟或两分钟；两人在床旁始终没有说一句话；公爵心跳得厉害，在室内死一般的沉寂中好像都能听得到心跳声。但是他已经适应了在黑暗中看东西了，因而已有看清整张床；那上面有人纹丝不动地睡着；听不到一点动静，也听不到丝毫气息。睡着的人被蒙头盖上了一条白床单，但是四肢轮廓似乎显得很模糊；根据凸现的样子，只看得出，睡着的人直挺挺地躺在那里。周围乱糟槽的，床上、脚边、床旁的圈椅上，甚至地上到处乱扔着脱下来的衣服，豪华的白色丝绸裙子，鲜花，缎带。床头旁的小几上摘下来乱摆的钻石首饰闪闪发亮。在脚边一些花边缠成一团，就在那些发白的花边上，从被单下露出一只光裸的脚的脚尖；它就像是大理石雕凿出来似的，一动不动得可怕；公爵看着并感觉到，他越看，房间里就越显死气沉沉和寂静肃穆，突然一只活动起来的苍蝇发出嗡嗡声，在床上方飞过，在床头边销声，公爵颤栗了一下。\n “出去吧，”罗戈任碰了一下公爵的手。\n 他们走了出来，重又坐到刚才的椅子上，还是面对面坐着。公爵打颤越来越厉害，同时疑问的目光一直不从罗戈任的脸上移开。\n “我看得出，列夫·尼古拉耶维奇，你在打颤，”罗戈任终于说，“你情绪失常时，记得吗，在莫斯科那次几乎就是这样，或者就是发病前是这样。我想不出来，现在该对你怎么办……”\n 公爵聚精会神，用心听着，以便理解眼前发生的事，同时又一直用目光询问着。\n “这是你干的？”他朝门帘那边点了下头，终于说。\n “这……是我……”罗戈任嗫嚅着说，并垂下了头。\n 他们沉默了５分钟光景。\n “因为，”罗戈任突然继续说，仿佛未曾中断谈话似的，“因为要是你发起病来，现在喊叫起来，那么，街上或者院子里大概就会有人听到并猜到，住宅里有人过夜，就会来敲门，就会有人进来……因为大家以为我不在家。我连蜡烛也不点，就是为了不让街上或院子里的人知道。因为我不在时总把钥匙带走，所以没有我，三四天都不会有人进来收拾房间，这是我立的规矩。因此不能让人家知道我们在这里过夜……”\n “等一下，”公爵说，“我刚才间过管院人和老大婆：纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜有没有过夜？看来，他们已经知道了。”\n “我知道你问过。我对帕夫季耶夫娜说，昨天纳斯塔西娅·费利帕夫娜顺便来，昨天就去帕夫洛夫斯克了，在我这儿只呆了１０分钟。所以他们不知道她在这里过夜……谁也不知道。昨天我们进来时，完全是悄悄地，就像今天我和你进来时一样。路上我还暗自想，她会不愿意悄悄地进来，－－哪有的的！她低声说话，踮着脚走。为免得发出声响，还脱下了身上的裙子，拿在手里，上楼梯时她自己还用手指头警告我别出声。她一直怕的是你。在火车上完全像个疯子似的，全是因为骇怕，也是她自己愿意到我这儿过夜的；我起先想把她送到教师妻子那儿去的，——哪儿的活！她说，‘在那里天一亮他就把我找到了，你把我藏起来，明天天一亮就去莫斯科”后来又想去奥廖尔的什么地方。她躺下睡觉时还一直说，我们去奥廖尔……”\n “等一下，你现在怎么办，帕尔芬，你想干什么？”\n “我就不放心你，你一直在打颤。我们就在这里过夜，一起过夜。除了那张床，这里没有别的床铺，我这样想好了，把两只沙发上的靠垫拿下来，就在这里，在幔窗旁，并排铺起来，给你睡也给我睡，这样可以待在一起。因为，如果有人进来，就会查看或寻找，马上就会看见她并将她运走。就会审问我，我就说是我干的，于是马上会把我带走。现在就让她这样躺着，就在我们旁边，在我和你旁边……”\n “对，对！”公爵热烈地肯定说。\n “就是说，不去自首，也不让抬走。”\n “决不！”公爵决然说，“无论如何也不！”\n “我就是这样决定的，老弟，无论如何无论是谁都不交出去。我们悄悄地过一夜。我今天从家里出去只有１小时，是在上午，其余时间一直呆在她身边。后来晚上了我又去找你。我也还担心，天气闷热，会有味儿。你闻到味儿没有？”\n “也许闻到了也不知道。到早晨一定会有味的。”\n “我给她盖上了漆布，很好的美国漆布，漆布上面又罩了床单，还放了四瓶开了盖的日丹诺夫杀菌剂，现在还在那里。”\n “就像那里……莫斯科出的事一样？”\n “因为，兄弟，怕有味儿。她可就像躺着睡觉守样……到早晨天亮了，你再看看。你怎么啦，起不来了？”看到公爵哆嗦得站不起来，罗戈任又担心又谅讶地问。\n “两腿使不上劲，”公爵喃喃说，“这是因为骇怕，我知道……等过了这一阵，就能站起来的……”\n “等一下，我先来给我们铺好垫子，让你好躺下……”我也跟你一起躺下……然后静听……因为，兄弟，我还不知道……兄弟，我现在还没有全都知道，所以我先对你说，让你早点知道这一切……”\n 罗戈任一边含糊不清地嘀咕着，一边开始铺垫子，看来，也许还在上午他就暗自想好了这样铺。昨天夜里他自己躺在沙发上。但是沙发上并排躺两人睡不下，而他现在又一定要铺在一起，所以此刻费了好大劲把两只沙发上大小不一的靠垫经过整个房间搬到幔帘后的入口处，总算马马虎虎安顿好了铺位。他走到分爵跟前，温柔而兴奋地搀着他的手，扶他起来，把他带到铺位前；但是，公爵原来已经能自己行走，这就是说，“骇怕已经过去了；”然而他仍然在继续打颤。\n “兄弟，因为现在天热，”罗戈任让公爵躺到左边比较好的垫子上，自己则双手枕在脑后，在右边和衣躺下，突然开始说，“你也知道，会有味儿……我怕打开窗户；母亲那儿有些盆花，开着许多花，而且发出很好的香味，我想搬过来，可是帕夫季耶夫娜会猜到的，她很好奇。”\n “她是很好奇，”公爵随声附和道。\n “莫非去买些花束和鲜花来放在她周围？我想，朋友，看着她躺在花丛中，会觉得很可怜。”\n “听着……”公爵好像思绪紊乱，寻思着究竟应该问什么，又仿佛立即忘了，“听着，告诉我：你用什么干的？用刀子？就那一把？”\n “就那一把。”\n “再等一下！帕尔芬，我还想问你……我有许多问题要问你，关于这一切……但你最好先告诉我，一开始就让我知道：你是不是想在我婚礼举行前，就在结婚仪式前，在教堂门前的台阶上就用刀杀死她？你想不想？”\n “我不知道，想还是不想……”罗戈任干巴巴地回答说，甚至仿佛对此问题感到奇怪和不解。\n “你从来也没把刀随身带往帕夫洛夫斯克吗？”\n “从来没有。我能对你讲的就只是这把刀子，列夫·尼古拉耶维奇，”他沉默一会，又补充说，“我是今天早晨把它从锁着的抽屉里拿出来的，全部事情都是在凌晨３点钟时发生的。这把刀子一直夹放在书里……还有……还使我感到奇怪的是，刀似乎进了一俄寸半……甚或是两俄寸……就在左胸口……可总共就只半汤匙血流在衬衣上，再也没有了……”\n “这个，这个，这个，”突然公爵激动万分地抬起身子，说，“这个我知道，我书上读到过……这叫内出血……甚至有一滴血也不流的。这是正好刺中心脏……”\n “等等，你听见没有？”罗戈任突然很快打断了公爵，惊恐地在垫子上坐起来，“听见了吗？”\n “没有！”公爵望着罗戈任，同样惊恐地很快回答着。\n “有人在走动！听见了吗？在厅堂里……”\n 两人开始倾听。\n “听见了，”公爵坚定地低声说。\n “在走动？”\n “在走动。”\n “要不要锁上门？”\n “锁上……”\n 门锁上了，两人重又躺下。很长时间没有作声。\n “啊，对了！”公爵突然用原先那种激动和急促的低语轻声说，似乎又捕到了一个念头，非常担心再把它丢了，甚至从铺位上跳了起来。“对了……我想要……这副牌，牌……据说，你跟地玩过牌？”\n “玩过，”罗戈任沉默一会说。\n “牌……在哪里？”\n “牌就在这里……”静默了更长一会，罗戈任说，“就是这副……”\n 他从口袋里扫出一副玩过的包在\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/256/2414.html","bookId":242,"book":{"id":242,"title":"白痴 The Idiot","description":"简介： The
