He turned to Fang, who shrugged—then he turned to Deaderick and asked, “Are we too—?”\n But before he had time to finish the question, the charge connected and blew into a thousand shards, propelled by gunpowder and fire. It shattered and split, right in the middle, and the boat began to sink—this one faster than the first.\n A huge—and hugely heavy—gun slid downward. The shell had come up right underneath it, and now the gun was falling, its weight pulling the craft apart. The antiaircraft piece had been bolted to the deck, and it took a slab of this same deck with it as it tumbled down through the serene, thick water. Pieces of wood shattered, and splintered planking came raining down through the swamp, then up again as it left the weight of the gun and its fixings.\n Everything that could float, did. Everything that could not, drifted to the bottom.\n Josephine came running out again, with Ruthie on her heels. “Did we hit it? Did we take it?”\n “We took it!” Houjin shouted. “It’s gone down! I can’t see it anymore!”\n “Look around that visor, kid!” Cly pointed at the window.\n Houjin peeled his face away from the scope, revealing a red groove around his eyes and down his cheeks, where he’d pressed himself so hard against the seam that it’d left an imprint.\n “There it is!” he all but shrieked.\n “Yeah, kid. There it is…,” the captain said with a bit of wonder taking the edge off his voice. “How many more?”\n “Um?…” Houjin crushed his face back against the visor. “Four more. I can see four. We should be down to two, but the other two—and they’re all Texian—must have come from around the island. They’re coming out to help. They’re not shooting at the airships anymore, so that’s something, isn’t it?”\n “It sure is. Now, where’s the nearest boat?”\n “About sixty … maybe eighty yards north-northeast. Turn us, and I’ll tell you when we’re lined up with them.”\n “Where are Mumler and Little?”\n “I don’t see them, sir. Wait—one of them is right behind us, and he says … he says … he’s telling us to head deeper, to the north.”\n “Why?”\n “I don’t know!” the boy said, exasperated. “Maybe we’re running into shallow territory. Can you see the bottom?”\n “Not well,” Cly admitted.\n “Not at all,” Deaderick amended.\n “Fine. Follow the lead of … whichever one of them it is. You can’t tell?”\n “It’s dark, sir. They’re keeping low. People are shooting—everyone up there, everyone is shooting.”\n The captain grunted and said, “Good thing for us we’re down here. I hope those fellows stay out of trouble.”\n Deaderick turned around and said, “Houjin—do you see the other one? Anywhere? Did he get shot out, or is he just holding back?”\n “I can’t tell, sir. It’s too dark. It’s just too damn dark.”\n At that moment, a shudder shook Ganymede, and its lower portion dragged. Cly and Deaderick leaned forward, and Houjin clutched at the scope to keep from falling—and from the other room came the rustle and tumble of knees and elbows clattering and rolling.\n “What was that?” Houjin asked frantically. “What’s going on? I didn’t see anything!”\n Deaderick took a stab at an answer. “Sandbar? Are we stuck? Captain—are we still—?”\n “Not stuck, no,” he said, and shoved harder on the propulsion levers, and on the depth setters. “But caught. That’s what our friend up top was trying to tell us. Shit, all right. Hang on—and Huey, drop the scope back down, just for now. I’ve got to raise us to keep us going. We’re snagged on the sand, and if we don’t get some lift, we’ll have a hell of a time pulling ourselves loose.”\n “Yes, sir!”\n “Everyone good in the charge bay?” Deaderick shouted the question.\n “All good over here!” Josephine replied. “Just get us moving again!”\n “We never stopped,” Cly swore, but he worked the levers with the passion of someone who was terrified he might be wrong.\n Finally, with a lurch and a thrust, Ganymede came free and rose with a bound, breaking the surface—much to the captain’s discomfort. The waterline sloshed at the top of the window, briefly revealing the fire in the sky above, and a flash of red and gold, flickering tracer bullets, and small explosions as ammunition collided with armor.\n “Huey, get your scope back up!” the captain ordered.\n “Yes, sir!” the boy answered, and turned the crank to raise it again, even as he smushed his face against the visor and tried to look through it, though there was nothing yet to see. “Got it, sir. Hold us steady, sir—the water keeps washing over, and I can’t … All right, it’s good. I can see again.”\n “Great. Now tell me this—did the two nearest boats see us, when we breached just now?”\n He hesitated. “They’re coming our way, or it might be they’re coming toward the sunk-down boats.”\n “But either way, they’re headed for us?”\n “Looks like it.”\n “To blazes with the lot of them, then. Troost!” Cly yelled. “Get in here! Deaderick, can you show him around the top ball turret and get him situated?”\n “If he makes it fast!”\n “Fast is our only speed right now. We don’t have time for anything else,” he noted, swinging the chair around and seeing Troost come tearing through the rounded charge bay door.\n “Right here, Captain. Early, set me up and I’ll start shooting. We’ll hit ’em from above and below, both.”\n The captain said, “Good man,” and then flashed Fang a worried look. Those Texian ships … he could see the underside of one approaching, and before he had time to ask where the rest of them were, Houjin cleared it up for them.\n “Captain, I see three Texas boats, all incoming. The fourth has headed back around the far side of the island. It looks like one of them doesn’t have an antiaircraft gun and it’s moving a lot faster. It’ll be on us before the others.”\n “Ladies, get us another charge loaded and ready!”\n It wouldn’t be shootable until Deaderick returned, because God knew nobody else on board had the faintest idea how to calibrate the weaponry, but better to have it ready for firing than add to the delay of setup. In the back of the craft, Cly could hear footsteps and scrambling, and then the squeal of metal being drawn down a track unwillingly—followed by a ratcheting sound that meant something was either going up or coming down, with gritty, forced precision.\n Muffled conversation occurred, and then, without warning, a spray of bullets bucked from the top of Ganymede’s hull, giving the whole vehicle an excuse to shake—and nearly giving the occupants their death of fright, even though everyone knew it was coming. The suddenness of it, and the volume of it … and then the quivering of the compartment … it was too much, too fast. Bullets strafed across the water and clomped against hulls or battered guns and sank through the torsos and limbs of men on deck.\n All these things hit the water, and some of them sank. Some of them floated.\n Deaderick hustled back into the main cabin, and into the engineer’s seat. “He’s got it,” he announced, and immediately began to configure the charge bays for firing. “What’s our next target—what’s … what’s closest? Which one?” he amended, realizing that there were now two more boats within their immediate view. Never mind the darkness; the small suns of burning hydrogen, rockets, and artillery fire gave the sky a peculiar glow that offset the bottoms of the Texian boats, making them easier to see from down below.\n Cly didn’t care which one went down first, and he almost said so. Then he changed his mind. “Huey, which one doesn’t have the antiaircraft?”\n “The one to the left. To the south, I mean. The one that was moving fastest.”\n “I didn’t see which one was fastest,” the captain confessed. “Got distracted. Left craft, Early. Ready, aim, and tell the ladies when to fire.”\n He fixed a switch and called, “Fire!”\n With a pounding sound and a protracted swish, the shell barreled across the bay and collided with the leftmost Texian patrol boat—which was bowled nearly over by the impact, and then came utterly apart when the charge caught, and blew, and sent fragments of the boat in a million directions at once. It sank almost immediately, without the stuttering hesitation of the first boat—and without the dignified fractures of the second. This boat was in bits before it went under, more kindling than craft.\n Several corpses plunged in with it, lacerated and bleeding from thick slivers of timber or the charge itself. A stray limb went spinning by, slapping against the window and leaving a streak of gore that washed away quickly, swiped aside by the plant life of the bay and the pace of the Ganymede, which churned forward toward the remaining boat.\n “Huey, does this last one have antiaircraft?”\n “It looks like a support cruiser, but I don’t see any signs that it’s firing from the deck. It’s turned the wrong direction. I can’t see it clearly enough to tell for sure.”\n But from their own deck equivalent, Troost was shooting like a maniac—threading the bullets into the automatic firing machine with the unmitigated joy of a man who finally has something to do. He swept the water as well as he could, for the range wasn’t as good as true antiaircraft, but he picked a line of men off the support cruiser’s deck, or so Houjin narrated above the din of the Gatling clone above.\n “He’s just about blown the pilothouse clear off the cruiser!” Houjin cried. “It’s falling down. The whole roof is collapsing—he hit a support, and cut right through it. That boat won’t do anyone any good, not for a good long time! But, oh! Captain!” \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ganymede-the-clockwork-century-3/page-58.html","bookId":1669,"book":{"id":1669,"title":"Ganymede (The Clockwork Century #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Ganymede (The Clockwork Century #3) \n The air pirate Andan Cly is going straight. Well, straighter. Although he’s happy to run alcohol guns wherever the money’s good, he doesn’t think the world needs more sap, or its increasingly ugly side-effects. But becoming legit is easier said than done, and Cly’s first legal gig—a supply run for the Seattle Underground—will be paid for by sap money. \n New Orleans is not Cly’s first pick for a shopping run. He loved the Big Easy once, back when he also loved a beautiful mixed-race prostitute named Josephine Early—but that was a decade ago, and he hasn’t looked back since. Jo’s still thinking about him, though, or so he learns when he gets a telegram about a peculiar piloting job. It’s a chance to complete two lucrative jobs at once, one he can’t refuse. He sends his old paramour a note and heads for New Orleans, with no idea of what he’s in for—or what she wants him to fly. \n But he won’t be flying. Not exactly. Hidden at the bottom of Lake Pontchartrain lurks an astonishing war machine, an immense submersible called the Ganymede. This prototype could end the war, if only anyone had the faintest idea of how to operate it…. If only they could sneak it past the Southern forces at the mouth of the Mississippi River… If only it hadn’t killed most of the men who’d ever set foot inside it. \n But it’s those “if onlys” that will decide whether Cly and his crew will end up in the history books, or at the bottom of the ocean.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/ganymede-the-clockwork-century-3.jpg","author":"Cherie Priest","type":"Science Fiction","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/ganymede-the-clockwork-century-3.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:51 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:01 PM"}}
