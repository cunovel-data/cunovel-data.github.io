He scratched at his ear and revisited the letters again and again, in case a fourth or fifth reading might squeeze some extra meaning out of the few brief lines.\\n\\n “Captain?” she asked, pretending she was offering another drink.\\n\\n Without looking up, he said, “Hm? Oh, I’m sure Angeline has her methods.”\\n\\n “No doubt. But what about you? What about that telegram?”\\n\\n “What about it?”\\n\\n “You taking the job?”\\n\\n He shrugged and finally looked up. “I could use the money, and there are lots of things I can pick up in New Orleans—things I can’t get just anyplace. I could bring you back some absinthe, Lucy. You ever had any absinthe? You’d be the richest bartender in the Territory if I could fetch you a few barrels.”\\n\\n “Oh, you’d do it for me. And here I was thinking maybe you wanted to go strike a match on an old flame.”\\n\\n “You’ve got it all wrong.”\\n\\n “I bet I don’t.”\\n\\n “It was complicated.”\\n\\n “I bet it wasn’t.”\\n\\n Just then the front door opened, sliding stickily forward on its rubber-coated seals. Everyone in Maynard’s—Lucy, Andan, and the three men playing cards at a round green table in the back corner—turned to see the newcomer. After they looked him over, Cly shifted his weight on the stool, putting one foot down on the floor, and the men at the green table became engrossed in their game, their eyes darting back and forth over the cards.\\n\\n “Yaozu,” Lucy both announced and greeted him.\\n\\n The white-clad oriental man surveyed the underground saloon. His attention skimmed past the drunks and the gamblers, settled briefly on Andan Cly, and returned to Lucy. “Mrs. O’Gunning. I’d like to try some of that beer you brew. The local selection,” he clarified in precise, flawless English.\\n\\n She blurted, “Are you sure? It’s … an acquired taste, or so I’m told.”\\n\\n “Then allow me the opportunity to acquire it.”\\n\\n “As you like.” She stepped away from Cly, grabbing a clean mug off the second plank shelf and toting it over to the tap. “But if you don’t care for it, I have some huangjiu on hand. Mrs. Wong gives me a bottle every now and again; I think she takes them away from her husband. A barkeep should have something on hand for all her customers, don’t you think?”\\n\\n “Yes, but there’s no need to assume. Today I’d like to try this beer … about which I’ve heard so … much.”\\n\\n Though the pub was more empty than full and there were many seats available, Yaozu chose the stool next to Andan Cly. He sat upon it with a graceful swish that let the tail of his jacket fall perfectly behind him. A black braid snaked back and forth between his shoulder blades when he turned his head to examine the state of the fixtures, the stock on the shelves, Lucy O’Gunning as she filled his mug, and his own reflection in the mirror behind the bar.\\n\\n Then he regarded Andan Cly. Their eyes met in the glass.\\n\\n Cly adjusted his position on the stool, a frequent occurrence, for it was about a size too small for him. “So … what are you doing here, Yaozu?” He aimed for a cautiously friendly tone and more or less hit it.\\n\\n To what Cly considered the Chinaman’s credit, he did not stall the conversation with disclaimers or pleasantries. “I’d heard you were inside the walls—that your ship is docked at Fort Decatur. I thought I might find you here.”\\n\\n Lucy arrived with the beer and placed it before Yaozu with a dubious look in her eyes. Seattle’s home-brewed beverage was distilled from blight-contaminated water, and though it was safe to drink, it was rarely anyone’s first choice. Or second. Occasionally, it came in third.\\n\\n “Thank you, Mrs. O’Gunning,” he said. Without so much as a nervous sniff, he lifted the mug and began to drink. Two or three swallows into the draft, he paused and cocked his head to the right. “It certainly has a distinctive flavor.”\\n\\n “You’re too kind,” she said, still not convinced she wasn’t being humored. “I’m glad it suits you, and I suppose I’ll leave you to it.” Taking up her rag once more, she ambled to the far side of the bar and started cleaning anything that looked like it might hold still for a wipe-down, whether it needed it or not.\\n\\n When Lucy was gone, Yaozu set the beer aside. He said to Andan Cly, “I need a ship.”\\n\\n “What are you moving? Big sap shipment going out?”\\n\\n “On the contrary, I want to bring goods into the city.” He gave the beer a hard stare and a moment of philosophical inquiry. He took another drink before continuing. “I’ve been reorganizing Minnericht’s operations—a task which needed to be done long before his demise, might I add—and I’ve discovered that Seattle is running perilously low on the basic necessities. Between you and me, Captain, I’m not sure how much longer the city can remain habitable. Such as it is.”\\n\\n Intrigued, Andan Cly nodded. “So what are we talking about?” he asked. “Pitch and the like, for seals? Masks? Pump equipment?”\\n\\n “All that and more. We need canvas, lumber, charcoal for filters, coal for the furnaces, and that’s just the beginning.” He sighed. “Last week we ran out of coffee, and I thought the chemists would start an uprising.”\\n\\n “It can be a lifesaver,” Cly acknowledged. “Sharpens the mind, and the hands, too.”\\n\\n “That’s what they tell me.” Yaozu abandoned the beer glass, now more empty than full. “This will be an enormous undertaking, and I’m happy to finance it. Minnericht was an able tinkerer, but some of his works are not so stable or permanent as one might wish.”\\n\\n The ensuing silence in the saloon was so thick, you could spoon it into a bowl. Cly realized that everyone had been listening in, but he was still startled to feel the eyes of everyone present glued to himself and Yaozu.\\n\\n In a normal speaking voice, intended to be overheard, his companion added, “For now, things are as safe as always, of course. But there’s room for improvement, don’t you think? Here—” He pulled out some coins, one of which appeared to be pure gold. Placing them on the counter, he added, “Let us take a walk. We can discuss your fee.”\\n\\n Andan Cly wasn’t sure how he felt about taking a stroll with Minnericht’s former right-hand man, but there was more to be said, and Yaozu was unwilling to say it in front of an audience. The captain couldn’t blame him, so he shot Lucy a two-fingered wave and followed the Chinaman out the sealed door, into the dark, mulch-smelling spots beneath the city.\\n\\n Both men carried gas masks for convenience or emergency, but the masks were not required in the unfinished basement wonderland. There, forests of brick created a dank labyrinth that unfolded with bends, kinks, and curves under the streets as far as the Seattle wall extended, in every direction. It would have been an impenetrable place, blacker than any night without a moon, except that lanterns were hung on hooks at the spots where corners crossed, and at the mouths of the tunnel entrances.\\n\\n Yaozu unhooked a lantern and turned the knob to raise its wick. He offered the lamp to Andan Cly, who lifted it above his head. Courtesy of his prodigious height, the whole quarter was bathed in a yolk-yellow glow.\\n\\n “This way, Captain. Toward the vaults. If we take the long way around, I can show you what I mean.”\\n\\n The corridor was wide and flanked by the exposed wet bricks that characterized so much of the underground’s topography. Its floor had been packed, but it was not paved in any way; the surface was soggy from the atmospheric moisture—seeping rains above, drizzling down long-dead tree roots and filtering past the houses and businesses of the polluted city.\\n\\n The air captain and the oriental man walked side by side, their feet struggling slightly with the mucky path. And as they pushed onward, back farther and deeper away from the buried saloon called Maynard’s, Yaozu explained.\\n\\n “I am fond of this particular passage. It sees little travel, partly because”—he gave his dirty boots a rueful gaze—“no one ever installed flagstones or slats. And up ahead, one of the walls has crumbled across the path.”\\n\\n “Then why do you like it so much?” Cly asked, doing his best to keep the lantern steady. But with every step, shadows danced and kicked to the sway of the light, up and down the moss-covered walls and along the black-mud footway.\\n\\n “Because it very nearly connects our Chinatown to your vaults, and to the storage quarters back beneath Commercial Street.”\\n\\n Andan Cly said, “Huh. I can see why that would be useful. So you want to clean it out? Shore it up?”\\n\\n “I do. However, two walls will need to come down in order to make the way passable by track and mining cart,” he replied, referencing the handcarts and buckets by which some of the residents moved supplies and toted important items. “And above those walls, new sections of street-level buildings must be sealed against the blight.”\\n\\n “Gotcha.”\\n\\n “Also, if we expand and fix this passage, we could turn one of the offshoot basements into another pump room.”\\n\\n “Do we need another pump room? The air’s plenty breathable down here.”\\n\\n “So far,” Yaozu agreed, “but in the last few weeks, the workers have been keeping longer hours, and more coal is being used to power the pumps. My engineers suggest that it’s a maintenance issue. Therefore, I wish to invest in maintenance procedures. I want to clean the pump tubes, all two to three hundred feet of them, one after another.”\\n\\n Cly made a low, worried whistle. “That sounds like a big job.”\\n\\n “Yes—a job that will require the pumps to be shut down for cleaning, one at a time. But before we can begin such a chore, supplementary pumps must be operational. Do you understand?” \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ganymede-the-clockwork-century-3/page-5.html","bookId":1669,"book":{"id":1669,"title":"Ganymede (The Clockwork Century #3)","description":"Storyline: Ganymede (The Clockwork Century #3) \\n The air pirate Andan Cly is going straight. Well, straighter. Although he’s happy to run alcohol guns wherever the money’s good, he doesn’t think the world needs more sap, or its increasingly ugly side-effects. But becoming legit is easier said than done, and Cly’s first legal gig—a supply run for the Seattle Underground—will be paid for by sap money. \\n New Orleans is not Cly’s first pick for a shopping run. He loved the Big Easy once, back when he also loved a beautiful mixed-race prostitute named Josephine Early—but that was a decade ago, and he hasn’t looked back since. Jo’s still thinking about him, though, or so he learns when he gets a telegram about a peculiar piloting job. It’s a chance to complete two lucrative jobs at once, one he can’t refuse. He sends his old paramour a note and heads for New Orleans, with no idea of what he’s in for—or what she wants him to fly. \\n But he won’t be flying. Not exactly. Hidden at the bottom of Lake Pontchartrain lurks an astonishing war machine, an immense submersible called the Ganymede. This prototype could end the war, if only anyone had the faintest idea of how to operate it…. If only they could sneak it past the Southern forces at the mouth of the Mississippi River… If only it hadn’t killed most of the men who’d ever set foot inside it. \\n But it’s those “if onlys” that will decide whether Cly and his crew will end up in the history books, or at the bottom of the ocean.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/ganymede-the-clockwork-century-3.jpg","author":"Cherie Priest","type":"Science Fiction","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/ganymede-the-clockwork-century-3.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:51 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:01 PM"}}
