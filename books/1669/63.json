Let me get these bastards squared away, and we’ll see how late it’s really gotten. We can always pick up where we left off later. We’ll just say the score’s been put on hold.”\n “Will we, now?”\n “Yes,” he said, looking down at her, for she’d reached the street level and was a few feet below him.\n She noticed him looking down the top of her dress, but did not bother to cover herself, or pretend she hadn’t seen him looking. All she said was, “Call it how you like it. I won tonight.”\n “It’s whoever shoots best for the week,” he insisted.\n “The week?”\n “Yes, the week. It’s only Thursday. We’ll start again tomorrow night, and see who’s on top come Sunday morning.”\n “You’re a filthy heathen of a man, aren’t you?” she asked him, watching as he turned around and began his own descent to the knotted, bleached boards of the pier. And to her.\n “Ma’am, you don’t know the half of it.” \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/ganymede-the-clockwork-century-3/page-63.html","bookId":1669,"book":{"id":1669,"title":"Ganymede (The Clockwork Century #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Ganymede (The Clockwork Century #3) \n The air pirate Andan Cly is going straight. Well, straighter. Although he’s happy to run alcohol guns wherever the money’s good, he doesn’t think the world needs more sap, or its increasingly ugly side-effects. But becoming legit is easier said than done, and Cly’s first legal gig—a supply run for the Seattle Underground—will be paid for by sap money. \n New Orleans is not Cly’s first pick for a shopping run. He loved the Big Easy once, back when he also loved a beautiful mixed-race prostitute named Josephine Early—but that was a decade ago, and he hasn’t looked back since. Jo’s still thinking about him, though, or so he learns when he gets a telegram about a peculiar piloting job. It’s a chance to complete two lucrative jobs at once, one he can’t refuse. He sends his old paramour a note and heads for New Orleans, with no idea of what he’s in for—or what she wants him to fly. \n But he won’t be flying. Not exactly. Hidden at the bottom of Lake Pontchartrain lurks an astonishing war machine, an immense submersible called the Ganymede. This prototype could end the war, if only anyone had the faintest idea of how to operate it…. If only they could sneak it past the Southern forces at the mouth of the Mississippi River… If only it hadn’t killed most of the men who’d ever set foot inside it. \n But it’s those “if onlys” that will decide whether Cly and his crew will end up in the history books, or at the bottom of the ocean.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/ganymede-the-clockwork-century-3.jpg","author":"Cherie Priest","type":"Science Fiction","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/ganymede-the-clockwork-century-3.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:57:51 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:13:01 PM"}}
