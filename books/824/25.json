{"id":27258,"no":25,"title":"CHAPTER XXIV. A NEW BARGE.","content":"The next morning Hilda went down to Rochester with Netta, Tom Roberts accompanying them. They had no difficulty in discovering the barge-builder\u0027s. It seemed to the girls a dirty-looking place, thickly littered as it was with shavings; men were at work on two or three barges which seemed, thus seen out of the water, an enormous size. \"Which is Mr. Gill?\" Hilda asked a man passing. \"That is him, miss,\" and he pointed to a man who was in the act of giving directions to some workmen. They waited until he had finished, and then went up to him. \"I want to buy a barge, Mr. Gill,\" Hilda said. \"To buy a barge!\" he repeated in surprise, for never before had he had a young lady as a customer. Hilda nodded. \"I want to give it to a bargeman who has rendered me a great service,\" as if it were an everyday occurrence for a young lady to buy a barge as a present. \"I want it at once, please; and it is to be a first-class barge. How much would it cost?\" The builder rubbed his chin. \"Well, miss, it is a little unusual to sell a barge right off in this way; as a rule people want barges built for them. Some want them for speed, some want them for their carrying capacity.\" \"I want a first-class barge,\" Hilda replied. \"I suppose it will be for traffic on the Thames, and that he will like it to be fast.\" \"Well, miss,\" the builder said slowly, for he could not yet quite persuade himself that this young lady was[Pg 302] really prepared to pay such a sum as a new barge would cost, \"I have got such a barge. She was launched last week, but I had a dispute with the man for whom I built her, and I said that I would not hold him to his bargain, and that he could get a barge elsewhere. He went off in a huff, but I expect he will come back before long and ask me to let him have her, and I should not be altogether sorry to say that she is gone. She is a first-class barge, and I expect that she will be as fast as anything on the river. Of course, I have got everything ready for her—masts, sails, and gear, even down to her dingey—and in twenty-four hours she would be ready to sail. The price is fifteen hundred pounds,\" and he looked sharply at Hilda to see what effect that communication would have. To his great surprise she replied quietly: \"That is about the sum I expected, Mr. Gill. Can we look at her?\" \"Certainly, miss; she is lying alongside, and it is nearly high tide.\" He led the way over piles of balks of timber, across sloppy pieces of ground, over which at high tide water extended, to the edge of the wharf, where the barge floated. She was indeed all ready for her mast; her sides shone with fresh paint, her upper works were painted an emerald green, a color greatly in favor among bargemen, and there was a patch of the same on her bow, ready for the name, surrounded by gilt scrollwork. \"There she is, miss; as handsome a barge as there is afloat.\" \"I want to see the cabin. What a little place!\" she went on, as she and Netta went down through a narrow hatchway, \"and how low!\" \"It is the usual height in barges, miss, and the same size, unless especially ordered otherwise.\" \"I should like the cabin to be made very comfortable, for I think the boatman will have his wife on board. Could it not be made a little larger?\"[Pg 303] \"There would be no great difficulty about that. You see, this is a water-tight compartment, but of course it could be carried six feet farther forward and a permanent hatchway be fixed over it, and the lining made good in the new part. As to height, one might put in a good-sized skylight; it would not be usual, but of course it could be done.\" \"And you could put the bed-place across there, could you not, and put a curtain to draw across it?\" \"Yes, that could be managed easy enough, miss; and it would make a very tidy cabin.\" \"Then how much would that cost extra?\" \"Forty or fifty pounds, at the outside.\" \"And when could you get it all finished, and everything painted a nice color?\" \"I could get it done in a week or ten days, if you made a point of it.\" \"I do make a point of it,\" Hilda said. \"What do you say to our leaving this bulkhead up as it is, miss, and making a door through it, and putting a small skylight, say three feet square, over the new part? You see, it will be fifteen feet wide by six feet, so that it will make a tidy little place. It would not cost more than the other way, not so much perhaps; for it would be a lot of trouble to get this bulkhead down, and then, you see, the second hand could have his bunk in here, on the lockers, and be quite separate.\" \"Isn\u0027t there a cabin at the other end?\" \"Well, there is one, miss; you can come and look at it. That is where the second hand always sleeps when the bargeman has got his wife on board.\" \"I think that it would be better to have the second hand sleep there,\" Hilda said. \"This is very rough,\" she went on, when she inspected the little cabin forward; \"there are all the beams sticking out. Surely it can be made more comfortable than this.\" \"We could matchboard the timbers over if you like, but it is not usual.\" \"Never mind, please do it; and put some lockers up[Pg 304] for his clothes, and make it very comfortable. Has the barge got a name yet?\" \"Well, miss, we have always called her the Medway; but there is no reason that you should stick to that name. She has not been registered yet, so we can call her any name you like.\" \"Then we will call her the Walter,\" Hilda said, for the girls had already settled this point between them. \"And now, Mr. Gill, I suppose there is nothing to do but to give you a check for fifteen hundred pounds, and I can pay for the alterations when I come down next Monday week. Can you get me a couple of men who understand the work—bargees, don\u0027t you call them? I want them to take her as far as Hole Haven and a short way up the creek.\" \"I can do that easily enough,\" the builder said; \"and I promise you that everything shall be ready for sailing, though I don\u0027t guarantee that the paint in the new part of the cabin will be dry. All the rest I can promise. I will set a strong gang of men on at once.\" A few days later Hilda wrote a line to William Nibson, saying that she intended to come down with the child on the following Monday, and hoped that he would be able to make it convenient to be at home on that day. \"She is not long in coming down again, Betsy,\" he said, when on the Friday the barge went up to Pitsea again, and he received the letter, which was carried home and read by his wife, he himself being, like most of his class at the time, unable to read or write. \"I suppose the child pined in his new home, and she had to pacify him by saying that he should come down and see us next week. That will suit me very well. I have a load of manure waiting for me at Rotherhithe; it is for Farmer Gilston, near Pitsea, so that I shall just manage it comfortably. Next week I will go over to Rochester and see if I can hear of a good barge for sale.\" On the following Monday morning the girls again went down to Rochester, this time taking Walter with[Pg 305] them; having the previous week sent off three or four great parcels by luggage train. Roberts went to look for a cart to bring them to the barge-builder\u0027s, and the girls went on alone. \"There she lies, miss,\" Mr. Gill said, pointing to a barge with new tanned sails lying out in the stream; \"she is a boat any man might be proud of.\" \"She looks very nice indeed,\" Hilda said, \"though, of course, I am no judge of such things.\" \"You may be sure that she is all right, Miss Covington.\" \"Is the paint dry, down below?\" \"Yes. I saw that you were anxious about it, so put plenty of drier in. So that, though she was only painted on Saturday morning, she is perfectly dry now. But you are rather earlier than I had expected.\" \"Yes; we have sent a lot of things down by rail. Our man is getting a cart, and I dare say they will be here in a quarter of an hour.\" The things were brought on a large hand-cart, and as soon as these were carried down to the boat they went off with Mr. Gill to the barge. \"There, miss,\" he said, as he led the way down into the cabin; \"there is not a barge afloat with such a comfortable cabin as this. I put up two or three more cupboards, for as they will sleep in the next room there is plenty of space for them.\" Except in point of height, the cabin was as comfortable a little room as could be desired. It was painted a light slate color, with the panels of the closets of a lighter shade of the same. The inner cabin was of the same color. A broad wooden bedstead extended across one end, and at the other were two long cupboards extending from the ceiling to the floor. The skylight afforded plenty of light to this room, while the large one in the main cabin gave standing height six feet square in the middle. \"It could not have been better,\" Hilda said, greatly pleased.[Pg 306] \"Well, miss, I took upon myself to do several things in the way of cupboards, and so on, that you had not ordered, but seeing that you wanted to have things comfortable I took upon myself to do them.\" \"You did quite right, Mr. Gill. This big skylight makes all the difference in height. I see that you have painted the name, and that you have got a flag flying from the masthead.\" \"Yes; bargemen generally like a bit of a flag, that is to say if they take any pride in their boat. You cannot trade in the barge until you have had it registered; shall I get that done for you?\" \"Yes, I should be very much obliged if you would.\" \"And in whose name shall I register it? In yours?\" \"No; in the name of William Nibson. If you want his address it is Creek Farm, Pitsea.\" \"Well, miss, he is a lucky fellow. I will get it done, and he can call here for the register the first time he comes up the Medway.\" Roberts was sent ashore again for a number of hooks, screws, and a few tools. \"Now, Mr. Gill, we are quite ready to start. We shall get things straight on the voyage.\" \"You will have plenty of time, miss; she will anchor off Grain Spit till the tide begins to run up hard. You won\u0027t be able to get up the creek till an hour before high tide.\" \"That won\u0027t matter,\" Hilda said; \"it will not be dark till nine.\" \"You can get up the anchor now,\" the builder said to two men who had been sitting smoking in the bow. The barge\u0027s boat was lying bottom upwards on the hatches and another boat lay behind her. \"This boat does not belong to her, Mr. Gill; does she?\" Hilda asked. \"No, miss; that is the men\u0027s boat. When they have got the barge to where she is to be moored, they will row down to Hole Haven, and get a tow up with the[Pg 307] first barge that comes down after the tide has turned. How will you be coming back, Miss Covington?\" \"We have arranged for a gig to be at Hole Haven at eight o\u0027clock to drive us to Brentwood, where we shall take train to town. We shall not be up before half-past eleven, but as we have our man with us that does not matter; besides, the carriage is to be at the station to meet the train.\" The girls and Walter watched the operation of getting up the anchor and of setting the foresail and jib. They remained on deck while the barge beat down the long reach past the dockyards, and then with slackened sheets rounded the wooded curve down into Gillingham Reach, then, accompanied by Roberts, they went below. Here they were soon hard at work. The great packages were opened, and mattresses and bedclothes brought out. \"This reminds one of our work when you first came to us,\" Netta laughed, as they made the bed. \"Yes, it is like old times, certainly. We used to like to work then, because we were doing it together; we like it still more to-day, because not only are we together, but we are looking forward to the delight that we are going to give.\" Carpets were laid down, curtains hung to the bed, and a wash-hand stand fixed in its place. A hamper of crockery was unpacked and the contents placed on the shelves that had been made for them, and cooking utensils arranged on the stove, which had been obtained for them by the builder. By this time Roberts had screwed up the hooks in the long cupboards, and in every spot round both cabins where they could be made available. Then numerous japanned tin boxes, filled with tea, sugar, and other groceries, were stowed away, and a large one with a label, \"Tobacco,\" placed on a shelf for Bill Nibson\u0027s special delectation. Curtains that could be drawn were fixed to the skylights, looking-glasses fastened against the walls, and by the time that the barge neared Sheerness their labors were finished. Then the forward cabin was similarly made comfortable.[Pg 308] Walter had assisted to the best of his power in all the arrangements, and when he became tired was allowed to go up on deck, on his promise to remain quiet by the side of the helmsman. \"Now I think that everything is in its place,\" Hilda said at last, \"and really they make two very pretty little rooms. I can\u0027t say that the one in the bow is pretty, but at any rate it is thoroughly comfortable, and I have no doubt that Joshua will be as pleased with it as the Nibsons are with theirs. Oh, dear, how dusty one gets! and we never thought of getting water on board for the jugs.\" On going up on deck, however, they observed two barrels lashed together. \"Are those water?\" Hilda asked the man at the tiller. \"Yes, ma\u0027am.\" \"How do you get it out? I don\u0027t see a tap.\" \"You put that little pump lying by the side into the bunghole. I will do it for you, miss.\" \"Now we will go downstairs and tidy up, and then come and sit up here and enjoy ourselves,\" said Hilda. When they were below they heard a rattle of the chain, and, on going up, found that the barge had come to anchor in the midst of some thirty or forty others. The foresail had been run down and the jib lowered, but the great mainsail, with its huge, brightly painted sprit, was still standing. Roberts now opened a hamper that had been left on deck, and produced luncheon. Cold meat and beer were handed to the two watermen, who went up into the bow to eat it. An hour later the tide began to slacken, and many of the barges got up sail. \"Shall we get up the anchor, ma\u0027am?\" one of the watermen asked. \"There\u0027s plenty of time, is there not?\" Hilda asked. \"Yes, ma\u0027am, but we thought that you would like to see how she goes with the others.\" \"Yes, I should like that,\" Hilda said, and in a few minutes the barge was under sail again. \"She is a clipper, and no mistake,\" the man at the[Pg 309] tiller said, as one by one they passed the barges that had started ahead of them, and Walter clapped his hands in delight. \"We may as well go down to the lower end of the Hope, miss. We shall have plenty of time to get back again before there is water enough for us in the creek.\" For three hours they sailed about, the girls enjoying it as much as Walter. \"I do think, Netta, that I shall have to buy a barge on my own account. It is splendid, and, after all, the cabins are large enough for anything.\" \"You had better have a yacht,\" Netta laughed. \"You would soon get tired of always going up and down the river.\" \"One might do worse,\" Hilda said. \"Of course, now we shall give up that big house in Hyde Park Gardens, which is ridiculous for me and the boy. We have each got a country house, and when we want a thorough change I would infinitely rather have a yacht than a small house in town. I don\u0027t suppose that it would cost very much more. Besides, you know, it is arranged that I am always to have rooms at your house at the institute. That is to be the next thing seen after; you know that is quite agreed upon.\" \"I shall be glad to be at work again,\" Netta said. \"Now that Walter is found, there is certainly nothing to keep us any longer in town.\" \"I know that it must have been horribly dull for you, Netta, but you see that you are partly to blame yourself for refusing to go out with me.\" \"That would have been duller still,\" Netta laughed. \"I should have been a long time before I got to know people, and there is no good in knowing people when you are going right away from them in a short time, and may never meet them again.\" At last the men said that there would be water enough to get up the creek. \"We shan\u0027t be able to sail up, miss; you see, the wind will be right in our teeth. But that don\u0027t matter; we[Pg 310] can pole her up. The tide will take us along, and we shall only have to keep her straight and get her round the corners.\" \"Are you sure that there will be water enough?\" \"Yes, miss. You see, she is empty, and doesn\u0027t draw much more than a foot of water.\" As they entered the haven the head sails were dropped and the mainsail brailed up. The tide was running in strong, and, as the men had said, they had nothing to do but to keep the barge in the deepest part of the channel. \"How do you think they will be coming, Bill?\" Betsy Nibson said, as she joined her husband, who was standing on the bank dressed in his Sunday clothes. \"I cannot say, Betsy; if I had known I should have gone to meet them. They cannot drive here from Pitsea, but must walk; and, of course, I would have been there if I had been sure of their coming that way. But I should think most likely that they will drive to the haven and come up by boat.\" \"There is a new barge coming up the creek,\" Joshua said. \"You can see that she is new by her spars and sails.\" \"That\u0027s so, boy,\" Bill agreed. \"She has got a flag I haven\u0027t seen before at her masthead. It is white, and I think there are some red letters on it—her name, I suppose. \u0027Tis not often that a new barge comes up to Pitsea. She is a fine-looking craft,\" he went on, as a turning in the creek brought her wholly into view. \"A first-class barge, I should say. Yes, there is no doubt about her being new. I should say, from the look of her spars, she cannot have made many trips up and down the river.\" \"She has got a party on board,\" Mrs. Nibson said presently. \"There are two women and a child. Perhaps it\u0027s them, Bill. They may have some friend in the barge line, and he has offered to bring them down, seeing that this is a difficult place to get at.\" \"I believe you are right, Betsy. They are too far[Pg 311] off to see their faces, but they are certainly not barge people.\" \"They are waving their handkerchiefs!\" Betsy exclaimed; \"it is them, sure enough. Well, we have wondered how they would come down, but we never thought of a barge.\" The three hurried along the bank to meet the barge. Walter danced and waved his hat and shouted loudly to them as they approached. \"You did not expect to see us arrive in a barge, Mrs. Nibson,\" Hilda called out as they came abreast of them. \"No, indeed, miss; we talked it over together as to how you would come, but we never thought of a barge.\" \"It belongs to a friend of ours, and we thought that it would be a pleasant way of coming. She is a new boat. You must come on board and have a look at her before we land.\" In a few minutes the barge was alongside the bank, opposite the house. A plank was run across and Walter scampered over it to his friends. \"Bless his little face!\" Mrs. Nibson said, as she lifted him up to kiss her. \"What a darling he looks, Bill! And he has not forgotten us a bit.\" \"He could not well forget in a week,\" Bill said, rather gruffly, for he, too, was moved by the warmth of the child\u0027s welcome. \"Well, let us go on board and pay our respects. She is a fine barge, surely; and she has got the same name as the child.\" \"Why, it is not \u0027Jack,\u0027\" his wife said, looking up. \"Jack!\" her husband repeated scornfully. \"Didn\u0027t they call him Walter the other day? Go on, wife; the lady is waiting at the end of the plank for you.\" Mrs. Nibson put the child down and followed him across the plank, smoothing her apron as she went. \"My best respects, miss,\" she said, as Hilda shook hands with her warmly. \"We are glad to see you again, Mrs. Nibson, and hope that you have not missed Walter very much.\" \"I cannot say that I have not missed him a good deal,[Pg 312] miss, but, luckily, we have had other things to think about. We are giving up the farm; it is lonesome here in the winter, and I am going to take to barge life again.\" \"Well, what do you think of this barge, Mr. Nibson?\" Hilda asked. \"I allow she is a handsome craft, and she ought to be fast.\" \"She is fast. We have been sailing about until there was enough water in the creek, and we have passed every barge that we have come near. She is comfortable, too. Come below and look at her cabin.\" \"Well, I never!\" Mrs. Nibson said, pausing in astonishment at the foot of the ladder. \"I have been in many barge cabins, but never saw one like this.\" Her surprise increased when the door of the bulkhead was opened and she saw the sleeping cabin beyond. \"Did you ever, Bill?\" \"No, I never saw two cabins in a barge before,\" her husband said. \"I suppose, miss, the owner must have had the cabin specially done up for his own use sometimes, and the crew lived forward.\" \"There is a place forward for the second hand,\" she replied, \"and I suppose the owner will sleep here.\" \"Of course it is a loss of space, but she will carry a big load, too. Who is the owner, miss, if I may make so bold as to ask?\" \"The registered owner is William Nibson,\" Hilda said quietly. The bargeman and his wife gazed at each other in astonishment. \"But,\" he said hesitatingly, \"I have never heard of any owner of that name.\" \"Except yourself, Nibson.\" \"Yes, except myself; but I am not an owner, as I have sold the Mary Ann.\" \"There is no other owner now,\" she said, \"that I know of, of that name. The barge is yours. It is bought as testimony of our gratitude for the kindness[Pg 313] that you have shown Walter, and you see it is named after him.\" \"It is too much, miss,\" said Bill huskily, while his wife burst into tears. \"It is too much altogether. We only did our duty to the child, and we were well paid for it.\" \"You did more than your duty,\" Hilda said. \"The money might pay for food and shelter and clothes, but money cannot buy love, and that is what you gave, both of you; and it is for that that we now pay as well as we can.\" \"Miss Covington should say \u0027I,\u0027\" Netta broke in, \"for it is her present entirely. Walter\u0027s trustees could not touch his money for the purpose, and so she has done it herself.\" \"Hush, Netta! You should have said nothing about it,\" Hilda said; and then, turning to Nibson, went on, \"I am his nearest relative—his only relative, in fact—besides being his guardian, and, therefore, naturally I am the most interested in his happiness; and as, fortunately, I am myself very well off, I can well afford the pleasure of helping those who have been so good to him. Please do not say anything more about it. Now we will go on deck for a few minutes, and leave you and your wife to look round. We will show Joshua his cabin.\" So saying, she and Netta went on deck. Joshua, led by Walter, was just crossing the plank. He had not received a special invitation, and he felt too shy to go on board with these ladies present. Walter, however, had run across to him, and at last persuaded him to come. \"Well, Joshua,\" Hilda said, as she reached him, \"what do you think of the barge?\" \"She is as good a one as ever I seed,\" the boy said. \"Well, Joshua, she belongs to Mr. Nibson.\" \"To Bill?\" Joshua exclaimed. \"You don\u0027t mean it, miss.\" \"I do mean it,\" she said; \"this is his barge.\" \"Well, I shouldn\u0027t have thought that Bill was that artful!\" Joshua exclaimed almost indignantly. \"Fancy[Pg 314] his keeping it from the missis and me that he had been and bought a new barge! But she is a fine one, there aint no doubt about that.\" \"Come forward and look at your cabin, Joshua. I think you will say that it is more comfortable than usual.\" \"Well, I am blowed!\" the boy ejaculated, as he followed her down the ladder and looked round. \"Why, it is a palace, that is wot it is; it is more comfortable than the master\u0027s cabin aft in most barges. And what a bed! Why, it is soft enough for a hemperor.\" \"There are no sheets, Joshua. They told me that the men never use sheets in barges.\" \"Lor\u0027 bless you! no, ma\u0027am. We mostly stretch ourselves on the locker and roll ourselves up in a blanket, if we are lucky enough to have one. Why, I don\u0027t know as I shan\u0027t be afraid of getting into that bed, though I does take a header in the water every morning. There are lockers on both sides, too, and a basin. Who ever heard of such a thing as a basin? Why, miss, we allus washes in the pail on deck.\" \"Well, I should think that it would be a good deal more comfortable to wash down here in a basin on a cold morning.\" \"Well, I suppose it might, miss; it be sharp sometimes outside. Why, there is oilcloth all over the floor, and a mat to wipe one\u0027s feet at the bottom of the ladder, and a rug by the side of the bed! I never did see such things. Bill must have gone clean off his chump. Well, I am blessed!\" \"It is Miss Covington who has given Bill the barge and seen to its being fitted up,\" Netta said, \"and she has done her best to make your cabin as comfortable as possible, because you have been so kind to Walter.\" \"And I hope to do some more for you, Joshua, when I can see my way to do it. You will find two or three suits of clothes for your work in those lockers. I do not know that they will quite fit, but I dare say if they don\u0027t Mrs. Nibson can alter them for you, and you will[Pg 315] find shirts and warm underclothing, and so on, in that cupboard.\" Joshua sat down suddenly on a locker, completely overpowered with what seemed to him the immensity of his possessions. There the girls left him, and they went up on deck again. Going aft, they sat down and talked for a few minutes, and were then joined by Nibson and his wife. The latter still bore traces of tears on her cheeks, and there was a suspicious redness about Bill\u0027s eyes. \"We won\u0027t try to say what we would like to say,\" the man began, \"\u0027cause we could not say it, but we feels it just the same. Here we are with everything man or woman could wish for, ready to hand.\" \"As I have said before, Nibson, please do not say anything more about it. It has made me quite as happy to get this barge for you, and to make it comfortable, as it can do you both to receive it. And now we will go ashore.\" In the house they found that tea was ready, save pouring the water into the pot. A ham and a couple of cold chickens were on the table, and jam and honey were specially provided for Walter. Joshua did not make one of the party. After recovering from the contemplation of his own cabin he had gone aft and remained in almost awe-struck admiration at the comfort and conveniences there, until summoned by Bill to take his place and help to get the new boat into the water, and to row the ladies down to Hole Haven. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3138/86284.html","bookId":824,"book":{"id":824,"title":"The Lost Heir","description":"简介： A number of soldiers were standing in the road near the bungalow of Brigadier-General Mathieson, the officer in command of the force in the cantonments of Benares and the surrounding district....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3138","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:35 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:35 AM"}}
