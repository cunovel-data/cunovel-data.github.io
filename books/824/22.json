{"id":27255,"no":22,"title":"CHAPTER XXI. A BOX AT THE OPERA.","content":"\"I tell you what it is, Simcoe,\" Harrison said two months later, \"this affair of yours is getting to be a good deal more troublesome than I bargained for. It all looked simple enough; one only had to pick up a child, drive him in a cab across London, then down in a trap to Pitsea, hand him over to a man I knew would take good care of him, and take the payments for him when they became due, which would be no trouble, as I had to see the man occasionally on my own business. Of course I expected that there would be a big hue and cry for him, but I had no fear whatever of his being found. Then I managed through another man to get that body from the workhouse undertaker, and you managed the rest easily enough; but I tell you that the matter is getting a good deal hotter than I ever thought it would. \"I told you that I had been followed several times after leaving your place, and one morning when I went out early I saw footmarks, showing that someone had been walking round my house and trying to look in at the windows. I have a strong suspicion that I have been followed to my office, and I know that someone got in there one day at my dinner hour. I know, because I always fasten a piece of thread, so that if the door is opened it breaks it. There is nothing there that anyone could make anything of, but it is just as well to know if anyone has been prying about. The woman of the house was sure that she had not been in there, nor had she let anyone in; so the lock must have been picked. Of course anyone is liable to have his office robbed when he is out and it is empty; but nothing was taken, and if a common[Pg 263] thief had found nothing else he would probably have made off with my dress suit, which would have brought him a sov. in a second-hand clothes shop. \"You know I have an excessive objection to being watched. I have had nothing on hand lately, at any rate nothing that has come off, but I might have had, you know. Well, yesterday I was going down to see my man in the marshes, and to tell him that likely enough I should bring something down to him next week. I got out of the train at Tilbury, and, as you know, there are not a dozen houses anywhere near the station. Now, I have a habit of keeping my eyes open, and I saw a man sitting on an old boat. What called my attention particularly to him was that he was turned half round watching the entrance to the station as I came out. You can always tell whether a man is watching for someone, or whether he is merely looking generally in that direction, and this man was certainly watching for someone. The instant his eye fell upon me he turned round and stared at the river. The path to the public house lay just behind him. Now, it would be natural that hearing a footstep a man doing nothing would look round and perhaps say a word—ask the time, or something of that sort. Well, he didn\u0027t turn round. Now, it is my habit, and a very useful one, always to carry a glass of about the size of a folded letter in my pocket. Instead of going on to the public house I turned off from the path and walked away from the river. When I had got some little distance I took out my glass, and still walking along, I held it up so that I could see in it what was going on behind. The man was standing up, watching me. I put the glass in my pocket and dropped my handkerchief. I stooped down to pick it up, of course partly turning as I did so, and saw that he had instantly dropped into a sitting position again, with his back to me. \"That was good enough. I turned, cut across the fields, went straight back to the station and took the next ferry-boat to Gravesend, and came back that way. It is quite clear to me that not only is this girl on the[Pg 264] track still, but the chase is getting to be a very hot one, and that not only are they watching you, but they are watching me, and have in some way or other, though how, I cannot guess, found out that I go down to Tilbury, and have accordingly sent a man down to follow me. Now, I tell you frankly, I will have no more to do with the matter—that is to say, as far as going down on your business. As I have told you, I have always managed my own affairs so well that the police and I have no acquaintance whatever; and I am not going to be spied upon and followed and have the \u0027tecs upon my track about an affair in which I have no interest at all, except that, you having stood by my brother, I was glad to do you any service I could. But this is getting serious. I don\u0027t like it. I have told you I have business with the man, and get things off abroad through him that I should have great trouble in getting rid of in any other way; but unless in quite exceptional cases, these things are so small that they could be hidden away for months without much risk of their being found, however sharp the hunt after them might be. As I am in no way pressed for money I can afford to wait, though I own that I like to get the things off my hands as soon as I can, and as I considered that I ran practically no risk in going down with them into Essex, I never kept them at my house. However, for a time I must do so. I must tell you that when I am going down I always write beforehand and make an appointment for him to have his barge at the wharf at Pitsea, and I send my letter addressed to him: \u0027Mr. William Nibson, barge Mary Ann, care of Mr. Scholey, Spotted Horse, Pitsea.\u0027 You had better write to him in future. You need not put anything inside the envelope except notes for twenty-five pounds, and the words, \u0027For the child\u0027s keep for six months.\u0027 I need not say that you had better disguise your writing, both on the envelope and on the inside, and it is best that you should get your notes from some bookmaker on a race-course. You tell me you often go to races now and do a little betting. They are not the sort of men who take[Pg 265] the numbers of the notes they pay out, and it would be next to impossible for them to be traced to you.\" \"Thank you, Harrison; you have behaved like a true pal to me, and I am ever so much obliged to you. I quite see what you mean, and indeed it is as much for my interest as yours that you should not go down there any more. Confound that girl Covington! I am sure she is the moving spirit of it all. I always felt uneasy about her from the first, and was sure that if there was any trouble it would come from her. I wonder how the deuce she ever found out that you went down to Tilbury.\" \"That beats me too, Simcoe. As you may guess, I am always most cautious about it, and always take a very roundabout way of going to the station.\" \"I have been uneasy ever since that girl at our place left so suddenly. A fortnight afterwards we found that there was a hole bored through the doorpost. Of course it might have been bored before I went there; but in that case it is curious that it was never noticed before. I cannot help thinking that she did it.\" \"Yes, you told me; but you said that you tried the experiment, and found that when your man and his wife were talking there in a loud voice, and you had your ear at the hole, you could not catch a single word.\" \"Yes, that was certainly so. I could hear them talking, but I could not make out a word of their conversation. Still it is evident that somebody has been trying to hear. I cannot help thinking that it was that girl, though both Johnstone and his wife spoke very highly of her. Certainly the story she told them was true to a certain extent, for when they sent the box down to Reading I sent a man down there to watch, and she called to fetch it, and my man found out that she labeled it \u0027Oxford,\u0027 and took it away with her on the down train. As he had no directions to follow her farther he came back. After we found the hole I sent him down again; but he never came upon her traces, though he inquired at every village near Oxford.\" \"She may have been put there as a spy,\" the other[Pg 266] said; \"but as it is evident that she couldn\u0027t hear through that hole, it is clear that she could not have done them any good. That is, I suppose, why they called her off; so the puzzle still remains how they got on my track at Tilbury. I should like to have a good look at this Covington girl. I can admire a clever wench, even when she is working against me.\" \"There is \u0027The Huguenots\u0027 at Her Majesty\u0027s to-night, the first time this season. She very often goes in Lady Moulton\u0027s box, and it is likely enough that she will go to-night. It\u0027s the third box from the stage, on the first tier; I will go down to Bond Street and see if I can get hold of a box opposite, on the second or third tier. The money will be well laid out, for I should very much like you to study her face, and I won enough at pool at the club this afternoon to pay for it.\" \"Very well, then I will come round to your place. I really am curious to see the girl. I only caught a passing glimpse of her in the park that day.\" Simcoe was not wrong in his conjecture, for Hilda dined at Lady Moulton\u0027s, and they took their places in the latter\u0027s box just as the first bar of the overture sounded. She was in half mourning now, and in black lace, with white camellias in her hair and breast, was, as Netta had told her before starting, looking her best. \"That is the girl,\" Simcoe exclaimed, as she went forward to the front of the box. \"Well, there is no denying that she is good-looking,\" the other said, as he turned his glasses upon her; \"there is not a better-looking woman in the house. Plenty of self-possession too,\" he added, as Hilda took her seat and at once, in apparent ignorance that any glasses were upon her, took her own lorgnettes from their case and proceeded calmly to scan the stalls and boxes, to see who among her numerous acquaintances were there. As her eyes fell upon the two men sitting nearly opposite to her, her glasses steadied, then after a minute she lowered them. \"Lady Moulton, I regard it as a providence that you[Pg 267] brought me here this evening. Do you see those two men there in the box nearly opposite, in the second tier? Well, one of the men is Simcoe, to whom my uncle left all his property if Walter should not live to come of age, and who I am absolutely convinced carried the child away.\" \"I see them, my dear; they are staring at you. I suppose they are as much interested in you as you in them.\" Hilda again put her glasses to her eyes. \"She has just told Lady Moulton who I am,\" Simcoe said. \"She has a clever face, Simcoe—broad across the chin—any amount of determination, I should say. Ah! there, she is getting up to make room for somebody else.\" \"Stay where you are, my dear,\" Lady Moulton said, putting her hand on Hilda\u0027s arm; \"there is plenty of room for three.\" \"Plenty,\" she replied; \"but I want to watch those two men, and I cannot keep my glasses fixed on them while I am sitting in the front row.\" \"Hardly, my dear,\" Lady Moulton said with a smile. \"Well, have your own way.\" A fourth lady came in almost immediately. She took the third chair in the front, and Hilda, sitting half in the shade, was able to devote herself to her purpose free from general observation. She had already heard that Simcoe\u0027s companion had apparently suspected that he was watched, and had returned to town at once without speaking to anyone at Tilbury. She felt that he would probably henceforth choose some other route, and the chances of following him would be greatly diminished. The opportunity was a fortunate one indeed. For months she had been hoping that some day or other she could watch these men talking, and now, as it seemed by accident, just at the moment when her hopes had fallen, the chance had come to her. \"She has changed her place in order to have a better[Pg 268] look at us,\" John Simcoe said, as she moved. \"She has got her glasses on us.\" \"We came to stare at her. It seems to me that she is staring at us,\" Harrison said. \"Well, I should think that she knows my face pretty well by this time,\" Simcoe laughed. \"I told you she has a way of looking through one that has often made me uncomfortable.\" \"I can quite understand that. I noticed myself that when she looked at us, without her glasses, there was a curious intentness in her expression, as if she was taking stock of every point about us. She cannot be the girl who has been to your lodging.\" \"Certainly not,\" the other said; \"I know her a great deal too well for her to try that on. Besides, beyond the fact that the other was a good-looking girl too—and, by the way, that she had the same trick of looking full in your face when you spoke—there was no resemblance whatever between them.\" The curtain now drew up, and silence fell upon the house, and the men did not speak again until the end of the first act. They then continued their conversation where they had left it off. \"She has moved, and has been attending to the opera,\" Simcoe said; \"but she has gone into the shade again, and is taking another look at us.\" \"I am not given to nervousness, but upon my word those glasses fixed upon me make me quite fidgety.\" \"Pooh, man! she is not looking at you; she is looking at me. I don\u0027t know whether she thinks that she can read my thoughts, and find out where the child is hidden. By the way, I know nothing about this place Pitsea. Where is it, and which is the best way to get there?\" \"You can drive straight down by road through Upminster and Laindon. The place lies about three miles this side of Benfleet. There are only about half a dozen houses, at the end of a creek that comes up from Hole Haven. But I should not think of going near the[Pg 269] house. The latter, directed as I told you, is sure to find the man.\" \"Oh, I am not thinking of going! but I shall get a man to watch the fellows they sent down to watch you, and if I find that they seem to be getting on the right track, I shall run down at all hazards and take him away.\" \"Your best plan by far will be to go with him, on board Nibson\u0027s barge, up to Rochester. No doubt he can find some bargeman there who will take the boy in. Or, what would perhaps be better, hire a trap there, and drive him down to Margate or Ramsgate. There are plenty of schools there, and you might get up a yarn about his being a nephew of yours, and leave him there for a term or two. That would give you time to decide. By this time he will have but a very faint remembrance of his life in town, and anything that he may say about it will certainly meet with no attention.\" \"Would it be as well to do it at once, do you think?\" Simcoe asked. \"No; we have no idea how many people they may have on the watch, and it would be only running unnecessary risks. Stick to the plan that we have already agreed on, of communicating only by writing. But I think your idea of sending two or three sharp fellows down there to find out what the party are doing is really a good one.\" Hilda lowered her glasses as the curtain rose again. \"Oh, Lady Moulton!\" she whispered, \"I have found out all that I have been so long wanting to know. I believe now that in three days I shall have the child home again.\" Lady Moulton turned half round. \"How on earth have you found that out, Hilda? Are you a wizard indeed, who can read men\u0027s thoughts in their faces? I always thought that there was something uncanny about you, ever since that day of my fête.\" To Harrison\u0027s relief, Miss Covington did not turn her glass towards him again during the evening. When the curtain fell on the next act a gentleman, to whom Lady Moulton had nodded in the stalls, came in. After shaking[Pg 270] hands with her and her friends, he seated himself by the side of Hilda. \"Miss Covington,\" he said, \"I have never had an opportunity of speaking to you since that fête at Lady Moulton\u0027s. I have understood that the gypsy on that occasion was engaged by you, and that there was, if you will excuse me saying so, some little mystery about it. I don\u0027t wish to pry into that, but if you should ever see the woman again you will oblige me very greatly by telling her that I consider I owe her a deep debt of gratitude. She said something to me then that made a tremendous impression upon me, and I do not mind telling you it brought me up with a round turn. I had been going ahead a great deal too fast, and I see now that, had I continued on the same course, I should have brought absolute ruin upon myself, and blighted my life in every way. The shock she gave me by warning me what would come if I did not give up cards and racing showed me my utter folly, and on that day I swore never to touch a card or lay a penny upon a horse for the rest of my life. When I tell you that I have completely pulled myself round, and that, by the aid of an old uncle, to whom I went and made a clean breast of all, I am now straight in every way, and, as you may have heard, am going to be married to Miss Fortescue in a fortnight, you may guess what deep reason I have to be grateful to this gypsy woman of yours, and how I hope that, should you come across her again, you will tell her so, and should there be any possible way in which I can prove my gratitude, by money or otherwise, I shall be delighted to do so.\" \"I will tell her, Captain Desmond,\" the girl said in a low voice. \"I am sure that it will make her happy to know that she did some good that evening. I do not think that she is in need of money or assistance of any kind, but should she be so I will let you know.\" \"And do you really mean that you have discovered where General Mathieson\u0027s grandson is living?\" Lady Moulton asked, as they rose to leave their seats when the curtain fell.[Pg 271] \"I think so; I am almost sure of it.\" Lady Moulton had heard a good deal from Hilda as to the situation. Mr. Pettigrew had strongly impressed upon both Hilda and Colonel Bulstrode that it was very important that the contents of the will should not be talked about. \"We don\u0027t want our private affairs discussed in the press and made the subject of general talk,\" he had said, and it was only to Lady Moulton that Hilda had spoken freely of the matter, so far as the discovery of the new will, the change that had been made, and the singularity of Walter being missing. She had also mentioned her belief that Simcoe was at the bottom of this, but had breathed no words of her suspicion that the General had come to his death by foul play, or of her own conviction that Simcoe was an impostor, although there had been some talk in the clubs over the matter, for Colonel Bulstrode was by no means so discreet as Hilda, and among his intimate friends spoke his mind with great vehemence and strength of language as to General Mathieson having made so singular a disposition of his property, and he made no secret of his suspicion that Simcoe was at the bottom of Walter\u0027s disappearance. Thus the matter had gradually gone the round of the clubs; but it was not until Simcoe\u0027s own counsel had drawn from him the fact that Walter\u0027s death would put him into possession of the estate that the public in general learned the facts. \"It was a clever move,\" Mr. Pettigrew had said, talking it over with his partner. \"No doubt he was afraid that the question would be asked by our counsel, and he thought that it was better that the fact should come voluntarily from himself. His best plan by far was to brazen it out. No doubt nine men out of ten will consider that the affair is a very suspicious one, and some of them will give him the cold shoulder; but whatever their opinions, they dare not express them without laying themselves open to an action for libel, while, on the other hand, the fact that a man is heir to a good estate will always cause a good many to rally round him. Not the[Pg 272] best of men, you know, but enough to prevent his being a lonely figure in a club. \"Yes, I think he was certainly well advised to declare his heirship voluntarily, instead of having it drawn from him. He must have known, of course, that sooner or later the matter would be made public, and it is better for him to get the talk and gossip over now instead of the matter being known for the first time when he begins to take legal steps to compel us to put him into possession of the estate.\" \"What on earth did you mean, Hilda,\" Lady Moulton said, as the door of the carriage was closed and they drove off from Her Majesty\u0027s, \"by saying that you had discovered a clew by which you might in a few days find your little cousin?\" \"I cannot tell you exactly how I discovered it. At present it is a secret that both my mother and uncle charged me to keep, but when these troubles are over I will explain it all to you, though I should certainly do so to no one else.\" \"Well, I suppose I must be content with that, Hilda. But it certainly does seem extraordinary to me that by merely seeing two men in a box on the other side of the house you should have obtained a clew to what you have for a year now been trying to get at.\" \"It does seem extraordinary, Lady Moulton, but it really is not so, and I hope to convince you that I am right by producing Walter in a week from the present time.\" \"I hope you will, Hilda. I sincerely hope so, both for the child\u0027s sake, yours, and my own. Of course, when he is found there will be no possible reason for your keeping yourself shut up as you have done. I have missed you very much, and shall be very glad to have you under my wing again.\" \"Thank you for saying so, Lady Moulton; but so far as I have formed my plans, they are that Walter\u0027s trustees shall either let or sell the house in Hyde Park Gardens, and that I shall go down for a time with him into[Pg 273] the country. I have had a great deal of anxiety this last year, and I shall be very glad of complete rest for a time.\" \"That is reasonable enough, my dear, but I do hope that you are not thinking of burying yourself in the country for good. There, I am at home. Good-night, Hilda; thanks for the lift. It is not often my horses or my coachmen have a night off during the season.\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3138/86281.html","bookId":824,"book":{"id":824,"title":"The Lost Heir","description":"简介： A number of soldiers were standing in the road near the bungalow of Brigadier-General Mathieson, the officer in command of the force in the cantonments of Benares and the surrounding district....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3138","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:35 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:35 AM"}}
