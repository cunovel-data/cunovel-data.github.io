{"id":7741,"no":1,"title":"CHAPTER I - Chirp the First","content":"THE kettle began it! Don\u0027t tell me what Mrs. Peerybingle said. I know better. Mrs. Peerybingle may leave it on record to the end of time that she couldn\u0027t say which of them began it; but, I say the kettle did. I ought to know, I hope! The kettle began it, full five minutes by the little waxy-faced Dutch clock in the corner, before the Cricket uttered a chirp. As if the clock hadn\u0027t finished striking, and the convulsive little Haymaker at the top of it, jerking away right and left with a scythe in front of a Moorish Palace, hadn\u0027t mowed down half an acre of imaginary grass before the Cricket joined in at all! Why, I am not naturally positive. Every one knows that. I wouldn\u0027t set my own opinion against the opinion of Mrs. Peerybingle, unless I were quite sure, on any account whatever. Nothing should induce me. But, this is a question of act. And the fact is, that the kettle began it, at least five minutes before the Cricket gave any sign of being in existence. Contradict me, and I\u0027ll say ten. Let me narrate exactly how it happened. I should have proceeded to do so in my very first word, but for this plain consideration - if I am to tell a story I must begin at the beginning; and how is it possible to begin at the beginning, without beginning at the kettle? It appeared as if there were a sort of match, or trial of skill, you must understand, between the kettle and the Cricket. And this is what led to it, and how it came about. Mrs. Peerybingle, going out into the raw twilight, and clicking over the wet stones in a pair of pattens that worked innumerable rough impressions of the first proposition in Euclid all about the yard -Mrs. Peerybingle filled the kettle at the water-butt. Presently returning, less the pattens (and a good deal less, for they were tall and Mrs. Peerybingle was but short), she set the kettle on the fire. In doing which she lost her temper, or mislaid it for an instant; for, the water being uncomfortably cold, and in that slippy, slushy, sleety sort of state wherein it seems to penetrate through every kind of substance, patten rings included - had laid 2 hold of Mrs. Peerybingle\u0027s toes, and even splashed her legs. And when we rather plume ourselves (with reason too) upon our legs, and keep ourselves particularly neat in point of stockings, we find this, for the moment, hard to bear. Besides, the kettle was aggravating and obstinate. It wouldn\u0027t allow itself to be adjusted on the top bar; it wouldn\u0027t hear of accommodating itself kindly to the knobs of coal; it WOULD lean forward with a drunken air, and dribble, a very Idiot of a kettle, on the hearth. It was quarrelsome, and hissed and spluttered morosely at the fire. To sum up all, the lid, resisting Mrs. Peerybingle\u0027s fingers, first of all turned topsy-turvy, and then, with an ingenious pertinacity deserving of a better cause, dived sideways in - down to the very bottom of the kettle. And the hull of the Royal George has never made half the monstrous resistance to coming out of the water, which the lid of that kettle employed against Mrs. Peerybingle, before she got it up again. It looked sullen and pig-headed enough, even then; carrying its handle with an air of defiance, and cocking its spout pertly and mockingly at Mrs. Peerybingle, as if it said, \u0027I won\u0027t boil. Nothing shall induce me!\u0027 But Mrs. Peerybingle, with restored good humour, dusted her chubby little hands against each other, and sat down before the kettle, laughing. Meantime, the jolly blaze uprose and fell, flashing and gleaming on the little Haymaker at the top of the Dutch clock, until one might have thought he stood stock still before the Moorish Palace, and nothing was in motion but the flame. He was on the move, however; and had his spasms, two to the second, all right and regular. But, his sufferings when the clock was going to strike, were frightful to behold; and, when a Cuckoo looked out of a trapdoor in the Palace, and gave note six times, it shook him, each time, like a spectral voice - or like a something wiry, plucking at his legs. It was not until a violent commotion and a whirring noise among the weights and ropes below him had quite subsided, that this terrified Haymaker became himself again. Nor was he startled without reason; for these rattling, bony skeletons of clocks are very disconcerting in their operation, and I wonder very much how any set of men, but most of all 3 how Dutchmen, can have had a liking to invent them. There is a popular belief that Dutchmen love broad cases and much clothing for their own lower selves; and they might know better than to leave their clocks so very lank and unprotected, surely. Now it was, you observe, that the kettle began to spend the evening. Now it was, that the kettle, growing mellow and musical, began to have irrepressible gurglings in its throat, and to indulge in short vocal snorts, which it checked in the bud, as if it hadn\u0027t quite made up its mind yet, to be good company. Now it was, that after two or three such vain attempts to stifle its convivial sentiments, it threw off all moroseness, all reserve, and burst into a stream of song so cosy and hilarious, as never maudlin nightingale yet formed the least idea of. So plain too! Bless you, you might have understood it like a book better than some books you and I could name, perhaps. With its warm breath gushing forth in a light cloud which merrily and gracefully ascended a few feet, then hung about the chimney-corner as its own domestic Heaven, it trolled its song with that strong energy of cheerfulness, that its iron body hummed and stirred upon the fire; and the lid itself, the recently rebellious lid - such is the influence of a bright example performed a sort of jig, and clattered like a deaf and dumb young cymbal that had never known the use of its twin brother. That this song of the kettle\u0027s was a song of invitation and welcome to somebody out of doors: to somebody at that moment coming on, towards the snug small home and the crisp fire: there is no doubt whatever. Mrs. Peerybingle knew it, perfectly, as she sat musing before the hearth. It\u0027s a dark night, sang the kettle, and the rotten leaves are lying by the way; and, above, all is mist and darkness, and, below, all is mire and clay; and there\u0027s only one relief in all the sad and murky air; and I don\u0027t know that it is one, for it\u0027s nothing but a glare; of deep and angry crimson, where the sun and wind together; set a brand upon the clouds for being guilty of such weather; and the widest open country is a long dull streak of black; and there\u0027s hoar-frost on the finger-post, and thaw upon the track; and the ice it isn\u0027t water, and the water isn\u0027t free; and you couldn\u0027t say that anything is what it ought to be; but he\u0027s coming, coming, 4 coming! And here, if you like, the Cricket DID chime in! with a Chirrup, Chirrup, Chirrup of such magnitude, by way of chorus; with a voice so astoundingly disproportionate to its size, as compared with the kettle; (size! you couldn\u0027t see it!) that if it had then and there burst itself like an overcharged gun, if it had fallen a victim on the spot, and chirruped its little body into fifty pieces, it would have seemed a natural and inevitable consequence, for which it had expressly laboured. The kettle had had the last of its solo performance. It persevered with undiminished ardour; but the Cricket took first fiddle and kept it. Good Heaven, how it chirped! Its shrill, sharp, piercing voice resounded through the house, and seemed to twinkle in the outer darkness like a star. There was an indescribable little trill and tremble in it, at its loudest, which suggested its being carried off its legs, and made to leap again, by its own intense enthusiasm. Yet they went very well together, the Cricket and the kettle. The burden of the song was still the same; and louder, louder, louder still, they sang it in their emulation. The fair little listener - for fair she was, and young: though something of what is called the dumpling shape; but I don\u0027t myself object to that - lighted a candle, glanced at the Haymaker on the top of the clock, who was getting in a pretty average crop of minutes; and looked out of the window, where she saw nothing, owing to the darkness, but her own face imaged in the glass. And my opinion is (and so would yours have been), that she might have looked a long way, and seen nothing half so agreeable. When she came back, and sat down in her former seat, the Cricket and the kettle were still keeping it up, with a perfect fury of competition. The kettle\u0027s weak side clearly being, that he didn\u0027t know when he was beat. There was all the excitement of a race about it. Chirp, chirp, chirp! Cricket a mile ahead. Hum, hum, hum - m - m! Kettle making play in the distance, like a great top. Chirp, chirp, chirp! Cricket round the corner. Hum, hum, hum - m - m! Kettle sticking to him in his own way; no idea of giving in. Chirp, chirp, chirp! Cricket fresher than ever. Hum, hum, hum -m -m! Kettle slow and steady. Chirp, chirp, chirp! Cricket going in to finish him. Hum, hum, hum - m - m! Kettle not to 5 be finished. Until at last they got so jumbled together, in the hurry-skurry, helter-skelter, of the match, that whether the kettle chirped and the Cricket hummed, or the Cricket chirped and the kettle hummed, or they both chirped and both hummed, it would have taken a clearer head than yours or mine to have decided with anything like certainty. But, of this, there is no doubt: that, the kettle and the Cricket, at one and the same moment, and by some power of amalgamation best known to themselves, sent, each, his fireside song of comfort streaming into a ray of the candle that shone out through the window, and a long way down the lane. And this light, bursting on a certain person who, on the instant, approached towards it through the gloom, expressed the whole thing to him, literally in a twinkling, and cried, \u0027Welcome home, old fellow! Welcome home, my boy!\u0027 This end attained, the kettle, being dead beat, boiled over, and was taken off the fire. Mrs. Peerybingle then went running to the door, where, what with the wheels of a cart, the tramp of a horse, the voice of a man, the tearing in and out of an excited dog, and the surprising and mysterious appearance of a baby, there was soon the very What\u0027s-his-name to pay. Where the baby came from, or how Mrs. Peerybingle got hold of it in that flash of time, I don\u0027t know. But a live baby there was, in Mrs. Peerybingle\u0027s arms; and a pretty tolerable amount of pride she seemed to have in it, when she was drawn gently to the fire, by a sturdy figure of a man, much taller and much older than herself, who had to stoop a long way down, to kiss her. But she was worth the trouble. Six foot six, with the lumbago, might have done it. \u0027Oh goodness, John!\u0027 said Mrs. P. \u0027What a state you are in with the weather!\u0027 He was something the worse for it, undeniably. The thick mist hung in clots upon his eyelashes like candied thaw; and between the fog and fire together, there were rainbows in his very whiskers. \u0027Why, you see, Dot,\u0027 John made answer, slowly, as he unrolled a shawl from about his throat; and warmed his hands; \u0027it - it an\u0027t exactly summer weather. So, no wonder.\u0027 \u0027I wish you wouldn\u0027t call me Dot, John. I don\u0027t like it,\u0027 said Mrs. 6 Peerybingle: pouting in a way that clearly showed she DID like it, very much. \u0027Why what else are you?\u0027 returned John, looking down upon her with a smile, and giving her waist as light a squeeze as his huge hand and arm could give. \u0027A dot and\u0027 - here he glanced at the baby - \u0027a dot and carry - I won\u0027t say it, for fear I should spoil it; but I was very near a joke. I don\u0027t know as ever I was nearer.\u0027 He was often near to something or other very clever, by his own account: this lumbering, slow, honest John; this John so heavy, but so light of spirit; so rough upon the surface, but so gentle at the core; so dull without, so quick within; so stolid, but so good! Oh Mother Nature, give thy children the true poetry of heart that hid itself in this poor Carrier\u0027s breast - he was but a Carrier by the way - and we can bear to have them talking prose, and leading lives of prose; and bear to bless thee for their company! It was pleasant to see Dot, with her little figure, and her baby in her arms: a very doll of a baby: glancing with a coquettish thoughtfulness at the fire, and inclining her delicate little head just enough on one side to let it rest in an odd, half-natural, half-affected, wholly nestling and agreeable manner, on the great rugged figure of the Carrier. It was pleasant to see him, with his tender awkwardness, endeavouring to adapt his rude support to her slight need, and make his burly middle-age a leaning-staff not inappropriate to her blooming youth. It was pleasant to observe how Tilly Slowboy, waiting in the background for the baby, took special cognizance (though in her earliest teens) of this grouping; and stood with her mouth and eyes wide open, and her head thrust forward, taking it in as if it were air. Nor was it less agreeable to observe how John the Carrier, reference being made by Dot to the aforesaid baby, checked his hand when on the point of touching the infant, as if he thought he might crack it; and bending down, surveyed it from a safe distance, with a kind of puzzled pride, such as an amiable mastiff might be supposed to show, if he found himself, one day, the father of a young canary. \u0027An\u0027t he beautiful, John? Don\u0027t he look precious in his sleep?\u0027 7 \u0027Very precious,\u0027 said John. \u0027Very much so. He generally IS asleep, an\u0027t he?\u0027 \u0027Lor, John! Good gracious no!\u0027 \u0027Oh,\u0027 said John, pondering. \u0027I thought his eyes was generally shut. Halloa!\u0027 \u0027Goodness, John, how you startle one!\u0027 \u0027It an\u0027t right for him to turn \u0027em up in that way!\u0027 said the astonished Carrier, \u0027is it? See how he\u0027s winking with both of \u0027em at once! And look at his mouth! Why he\u0027s gasping like a gold and silver fish!\u0027 \u0027You don\u0027t deserve to be a father, you don\u0027t,\u0027 said Dot, with all the dignity of an experienced matron. \u0027But how should you know what little complaints children are troubled with, John! You wouldn\u0027t so much as know their names, you stupid fellow.\u0027 And when she had turned the baby over on her left arm, and had slapped its back as a restorative, she pinched her husband\u0027s ear, laughing. \u0027No,\u0027 said John, pulling off his outer coat. \u0027It\u0027s very true, Dot. I don\u0027t know much about it. I only know that I\u0027ve been fighting pretty stiffly with the wind to-night. It\u0027s been blowing north- east, straight into the cart, the whole way home.\u0027 \u0027Poor old man, so it has!\u0027 cried Mrs. Peerybingle, instantly becoming very active. \u0027Here! Take the precious darling, Tilly, while I make myself of some use. Bless it, I could smother it with kissing it, I could! Hie then, good dog! Hie, Boxer, boy! Only let me make the tea first, John; and then I\u0027ll help you with the parcels, like a busy bee. \"How doth the little\" - and all the rest of it, you know, John. Did you ever learn \"how doth the little,\" when you went to school, John?\u0027 \u0027Not to quite know it,\u0027 John returned. \u0027I was very near it once. But I should only have spoilt it, I dare say.\u0027 \u0027Ha ha,\u0027 laughed Dot. She had the blithest little laugh you ever heard. \u0027What a dear old darling of a dunce you are, John, to be sure!\u0027 Not at all disputing this position, John went out to see that the boy with the lantern, which had been dancing to and fro before the door and window, like a Will of the Wisp, took due care of the horse; who was fatter than you would quite believe, if I gave you his measure, and so old that his 8 birthday was lost in the mists of antiquity. Boxer, feeling that his attentions were due to the family in general, and must be impartially distributed, dashed in and out with bewildering inconstancy; now, describing a circle of short barks round the horse, where he was being rubbed down at the stable-door; now feigning to make savage rushes at his mistress, and facetiously bringing himself to sudden stops; now, eliciting a shriek from Tilly Slowboy, in the low nursing-chair near the fire, by the unexpected application of his moist nose to her countenance; now, exhibiting an obtrusive interest in the baby; now, going round and round upon the hearth, and lying down as if he had established himself for the night; now, getting up again, and taking that nothing of a fag-end of a tail of his, out into the weather, as if he had just remembered an appointment, and was off, at a round trot, to keep it. \u0027There! There\u0027s the teapot, ready on the hob!\u0027 said Dot; as briskly busy as a child at play at keeping house. \u0027And there\u0027s the old knuckle of ham; and there\u0027s the butter; and there\u0027s the crusty loaf, and all! Here\u0027s the clothes-basket for the small parcels, John, if you\u0027ve got any there - where are you, John?\u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t let the dear child fall under the grate, Tilly, whatever you do!\u0027 It may be noted of Miss Slowboy, in spite of her rejecting the caution with some vivacity, that she had a rare and surprising talent for getting this baby into difficulties and had several times imperilled its short life, in a quiet way peculiarly her own. She was of a spare and straight shape, this young lady, insomuch that her garments appeared to be in constant danger of sliding off those sharp pegs, her shoulders, on which they were loosely hung. Her costume was remarkable for the partial development, on all possible occasions, of some flannel vestment of a singular structure; also for affording glimpses, in the region of the back, of a corset, or pair of stays, in colour a dead-green. Being always in a state of gaping admiration at everything, and absorbed, besides, in the perpetual contemplation of her mistress\u0027s perfections and the baby\u0027s, Miss Slowboy, in her little errors of judgment, may be said to have done equal honour to her head and to her heart; and though these did less honour to the baby\u0027s head, which they were the occasional means of bringing into contact with 9 deal doors, dressers, stair-rails, bed-posts, and other foreign substances, still they were the honest results of Tilly Slowboy\u0027s constant astonishment at finding herself so kindly treated, and installed in such a comfortable home. For, the maternal and paternal Slowboy were alike unknown to Fame, and Tilly had been bred by public charity, a foundling; which word, though only differing from fondling by one vowel\u0027s length, is very different in meaning, and expresses quite another thing. To have seen little Mrs. Peerybingle come back with her husband, tugging at the clothes-basket, and making the most strenuous exertions to do nothing at all (for he carried it), would have amused you almost as much as it amused him. It may have entertained the Cricket too, for anything I know; but, certainly, it now began to chirp again, vehemently. \u0027Heyday!\u0027 said John, in his slow way. \u0027It\u0027s merrier than ever, to- night, I think.\u0027 \u0027And it\u0027s sure to bring us good fortune, John! It always has done so. To have a Cricket on the Hearth, is the luckiest thing in all the world!\u0027 John looked at her as if he had very nearly got the thought into his head, that she was his Cricket in chief, and he quite agreed with her. But, it was probably one of his narrow escapes, for he said nothing. \u0027The first time I heard its cheerful little note, John, was on that night when you brought me home - when you brought me to my new home here; its little mistress. Nearly a year ago. You recollect, John?\u0027 O yes. John remembered. I should think so! \u0027Its chirp was such a welcome to me! It seemed so full of promise and encouragement. It seemed to say, you would be kind and gentle with me, and would not expect (I had a fear of that, John, then) to find an old head on the shoulders of your foolish little wife.\u0027 John thoughtfully patted one of the shoulders, and then the head, as though he would have said No, no; he had had no such expectation; he had been quite content to take them as they were. And really he had reason. They were very comely. \u0027It spoke the truth, John, when it seemed to say so; for you have ever been, I am sure, the best, the most considerate, the most affectionate of husbands to me. This has been a happy home, John; and I love the 10 Cricket for its sake!\u0027 \u0027Why so do I then,\u0027 said the Carrier. \u0027So do I, Dot.\u0027 \u0027I love it for the many times I have heard it, and the many thoughts its harmless music has given me. Sometimes, in the twilight, when I have felt a little solitary and down-hearted, John - before baby was here to keep me company and make the house gay - when I have thought how lonely you would be if I should die; how lonely I should be if I could know that you had lost me, dear; its Chirp, Chirp, Chirp upon the hearth, has seemed to tell me of another little voice, so sweet, so very dear to me, before whose coming sound my trouble vanished like a dream. And when I used to fear - I did fear once, John, I was very young you know - that ours might prove to be an ill-assorted marriage, I being such a child, and you more like my guardian than my husband; and that you might not, however hard you tried, be able to learn to love me, as you hoped and prayed you might; its Chirp, Chirp, Chirp has cheered me up again, and filled me with new trust and confidence. I was thinking of these things to-night, dear, when I sat expecting you; and I love the Cricket for their sake!\u0027 \u0027And so do I,\u0027 repeated John. \u0027But, Dot? I hope and pray that I might learn to love you? How you talk! I had learnt that, long before I brought you here, to be the Cricket\u0027s little mistress, Dot!\u0027 She laid her hand, an instant, on his arm, and looked up at him with an agitated face, as if she would have told him something. Next moment she was down upon her knees before the basket, speaking in a sprightly voice, and busy with the parcels. \u0027There are not many of them to-night, John, but I saw some goods behind the cart, just now; and though they give more trouble, perhaps, still they pay as well; so we have no reason to grumble, have we? Besides, you have been delivering, I dare say, as you came along?\u0027 \u0027Oh yes,\u0027 John said. \u0027A good many.\u0027 \u0027Why what\u0027s this round box? Heart alive, John, it\u0027s a wedding- cake!\u0027 \u0027Leave a woman alone to find out that,\u0027 said John, admiringly. \u0027Now a man would never have thought of it. Whereas, it\u0027s my belief that if you was to pack a wedding-cake up in a tea-chest, or a turn-up bedstead, or a pickled salmon keg, or any unlikely thing, a woman would be sure to find 11 it out directly. Yes; I called for it at the pastry-cook\u0027s.\u0027 \u0027And it weighs I don\u0027t know what - whole hundredweights!\u0027 cried Dot, making a great demonstration of trying to lift it. \u0027Whose is it, John? Where is it going?\u0027 \u0027Read the writing on the other side,\u0027 said John. \u0027Why, John! My Goodness, John!\u0027 \u0027Ah! who\u0027d have thought it!\u0027 John returned. \u0027You never mean to say,\u0027 pursued Dot, sitting on the floor and shaking her head at him, \u0027that it\u0027s Gruff and Tackleton the toymaker!\u0027 John nodded. Mrs. Peerybingle nodded also, fifty times at least. Not in assent - in dumb and pitying amazement; screwing up her lips the while with all their little force (they were never made for screwing up; I am clear of that), and looking the good Carrier through and through, in her abstraction. Miss Slowboy, in the mean time, who had a mechanical power of reproducing scraps of current conversation for the delectation of the baby, with all the sense struck out of them, and all the nouns changed into the plural number, inquired aloud of that young creature, Was it Gruffs and Tackletons the toymakers then, and Would it call at Pastry-cooks for wedding-cakes, and Did its mothers know the boxes when its fathers brought them homes; and so on. \u0027And that is really to come about!\u0027 said Dot. \u0027Why, she and I were girls at school together, John.\u0027 He might have been thinking of her, or nearly thinking of her, perhaps, as she was in that same school time. He looked upon her with a thoughtful pleasure, but he made no answer. \u0027And he\u0027s as old! As unlike her! - Why, how many years older than you, is Gruff and Tackleton, John?\u0027 \u0027How many more cups of tea shall I drink to-night at one sitting, than Gruff and Tackleton ever took in four, I wonder!\u0027 replied John, goodhumouredly, as he drew a chair to the round table, and began at the cold ham. \u0027As to eating, I eat but little; but that little I enjoy, Dot.\u0027 Even this, his usual sentiment at meal times, one of his innocent delusions (for his appetite was always obstinate, and flatly contradicted 12 him), awoke no smile in the face of his little wife, who stood among the parcels, pushing the cake-box slowly from her with her foot, and never once looked, though her eyes were cast down too, upon the dainty shoe she generally was so mindful of. Absorbed in thought, she stood there, heedless alike of the tea and John (although he called to her, and rapped the table with his knife to startle her), until he rose and touched her on the arm; when she looked at him for a moment, and hurried to her place behind the teaboard, laughing at her negligence. But, not as she had laughed before. The manner and the music were quite changed. The Cricket, too, had stopped. Somehow the room was not so cheerful as it had been. Nothing like it. \u0027So, these are all the parcels, are they, John?\u0027 she said, breaking a long silence, which the honest Carrier had devoted to the practical illustration of one part of his favourite sentiment - certainly enjoying what he ate, if it couldn\u0027t be admitted that he ate but little. \u0027So, these are all the parcels; are they, John?\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s all,\u0027 said John. \u0027Why - no - I - \u0027 laying down his knife and fork, and taking a long breath. \u0027I declare - I\u0027ve clean forgotten the old gentleman!\u0027 \u0027The old gentleman?\u0027 \u0027In the cart,\u0027 said John. \u0027He was asleep, among the straw, the last time I saw him. I\u0027ve very nearly remembered him, twice, since I came in; but he went out of my head again. Holloa! Yahip there! Rouse up! That\u0027s my hearty!\u0027 John said these latter words outside the door, whither he had hurried with the candle in his hand. Miss Slowboy, conscious of some mysterious reference to The Old Gentleman, and connecting in her mystified imagination certain associations of a religious nature with the phrase, was so disturbed, that hastily rising from the low chair by the fire to seek protection near the skirts of her mistress, and coming into contact as she crossed the doorway with an ancient Stranger, she instinctively made a charge or butt at him with the only offensive instrument within her reach. This instrument happening to be the baby, great commotion and alarm ensued, which the 13 sagacity of Boxer rather tended to increase; for, that good dog, more thoughtful than its master, had, it seemed, been watching the old gentleman in his sleep, lest he should walk off with a few young poplar trees that were tied up behind the cart; and he still attended on him very closely, worrying his gaiters in fact, and making dead sets at the buttons. \u0027You\u0027re such an undeniable good sleeper, sir,\u0027 said John, when tranquillity was restored; in the mean time the old gentleman had stood, bareheaded and motionless, in the centre of the room; \u0027that I have half a mind to ask you where the other six are - only that would be a joke, and I know I should spoil it. Very near though,\u0027 murmured the Carrier, with a chuckle; \u0027very near!\u0027 The Stranger, who had long white hair, good features, singularly bold and well defined for an old man, and dark, bright, penetrating eyes, looked round with a smile, and saluted the Carrier\u0027s wife by gravely inclining his head. His garb was very quaint and odd - a long, long way behind the time. Its hue was brown, all over. In his hand he held a great brown club or walking-stick; and striking this upon the floor, it fell asunder, and became a chair. On which he sat down, quite composedly. \u0027There!\u0027 said the Carrier, turning to his wife. \u0027That\u0027s the way I found him, sitting by the roadside! Upright as a milestone. And almost as deaf.\u0027 \u0027Sitting in the open air, John!\u0027 \u0027In the open air,\u0027 replied the Carrier, \u0027just at dusk. \"Carriage Paid,\" he said; and gave me eighteenpence. Then he got in. And there he is.\u0027 \u0027He\u0027s going, John, I think!\u0027 Not at all. He was only going to speak. \u0027If you please, I was to be left till called for,\u0027 said the Stranger, mildly. \u0027Don\u0027t mind me.\u0027 With that, he took a pair of spectacles from one of his large pockets, and a book from another, and leisurely began to read. Making no more of Boxer than if he had been a house lamb! The Carrier and his wife exchanged a look of perplexity. The Stranger raised his head; and glancing from the latter to the former, said, 14 \u0027Your daughter, my good friend?\u0027 \u0027Wife,\u0027 returned John. \u0027Niece?\u0027 said the Stranger. \u0027Wife,\u0027 roared John. \u0027Indeed?\u0027 observed the Stranger. \u0027Surely? Very young!\u0027 He quietly turned over, and resumed his reading. But, before he could have read two lines, he again interrupted himself to say: \u0027Baby, yours?\u0027 John gave him a gigantic nod; equivalent to an answer in the affirmative, delivered through a speaking trumpet. \u0027Girl?\u0027 \u0027Bo-o-oy!\u0027 roared John. \u0027Also very young, eh?\u0027 Mrs. Peerybingle instantly struck in. \u0027Two months and three da- ays! Vaccinated just six weeks ago-o! Took very fine-ly! Considered, by the doctor, a remarkably beautiful chi-ild! Equal to the general run of children at five months o-old! Takes notice, in a way quite wonderful! May seem impossible to you, but feels his legs al-ready!\u0027 Here the breathless little mother, who had been shrieking these short sentences into the old man\u0027s ear, until her pretty face was crimsoned, held up the Baby before him as a stubborn and triumphant fact; while Tilly Slowboy, with a melodious cry of \u0027Ketcher, Ketcher\u0027 - which sounded like some unknown words, adapted to a popular Sneeze - performed some cow-like gambols round that all unconscious Innocent. \u0027Hark! He\u0027s called for, sure enough,\u0027 said John. \u0027There\u0027s somebody at the door. Open it, Tilly.\u0027 Before she could reach it, however, it was opened from without; being a primitive sort of door, with a latch, that any one could lift if he chose and a good many people did choose, for all kinds of neighbours liked to have a cheerful word or two with the Carrier, though he was no great talker himself. Being opened, it gave admission to a little, meagre, thoughtful, dingy-faced man, who seemed to have made himself a greatcoat from the sack-cloth covering of some old box; for, when he turned to shut the door, and keep the weather out, he disclosed upon the back of that 15 garment, the inscription G \u0026 T in large black capitals. Also the word GLASS in bold characters. \u0027Good evening, John!\u0027 said the little man. \u0027Good evening, Mum. Good evening, Tilly. Good evening, Unbeknown! How\u0027s Baby, Mum? Boxer\u0027s pretty well I hope?\u0027 \u0027All thriving, Caleb,\u0027 replied Dot. \u0027I am sure you need only look at the dear child, for one, to know that.\u0027 \u0027And I\u0027m sure I need only look at you for another,\u0027 said Caleb. He didn\u0027t look at her though; he had a wandering and thoughtful eye which seemed to be always projecting itself into some other time and place, no matter what he said; a description which will equally apply to his voice. \u0027Or at John for another,\u0027 said Caleb. \u0027Or at Tilly, as far as that goes. Or certainly at Boxer.\u0027 \u0027Busy just now, Caleb?\u0027 asked the Carrier. \u0027Why, pretty well, John,\u0027 he returned, with the distraught air of a man who was casting about for the Philosopher\u0027s stone, at least. \u0027Pretty much so. There\u0027s rather a run on Noah\u0027s Arks at present. I could have wished to improve upon the Family, but I don\u0027t see how it\u0027s to be done at the price. It would be a satisfaction to one\u0027s mind, to make it clearer which was Shems and Hams, and which was Wives. Flies an\u0027t on that scale neither, as compared with elephants you know! Ah! well! Have you got anything in the parcel line for me, John?\u0027 The Carrier put his hand into a pocket of the coat he had taken off; and brought out, carefully preserved in moss and paper, a tiny flower-pot. \u0027There it is!\u0027 he said, adjusting it with great care. \u0027Not so much as a leaf damaged. Full of buds!\u0027 Caleb\u0027s dull eye brightened, as he took it, and thanked him. \u0027Dear, Caleb,\u0027 said the Carrier. \u0027Very dear at this season.\u0027 \u0027Never mind that. It would be cheap to me, whatever it cost,\u0027 returned the little man. \u0027Anything else, John?\u0027 \u0027A small box,\u0027 replied the Carrier. \u0027Here you are!\u0027 \u0027\"For Caleb Plummer,\"\u0027 said the little man, spelling out the direction. \u0027\"With Cash.\" With Cash, John? I don\u0027t think it\u0027s for me.\u0027 16 \u0027With Care,\u0027 returned the Carrier, looking over his shoulder. \u0027Where do you make out cash?\u0027 \u0027Oh! To be sure!\u0027 said Caleb. \u0027It\u0027s all right. With care! Yes, yes; that\u0027s mine. It might have been with cash, indeed, if my dear Boy in the Golden South Americas had lived, John. You loved him like a son; didn\u0027t you? You needn\u0027t say you did. I know, of course. \"Caleb Plummer. With care.\" Yes, yes, it\u0027s all right. It\u0027s a box of dolls\u0027 eyes for my daughter\u0027s work. I wish it was her own sight in a box, John.\u0027 \u0027I wish it was, or could be!\u0027 cried the Carrier. \u0027Thank\u0027ee,\u0027 said the little man. \u0027You speak very hearty. To think that she should never see the Dolls - and them a-staring at her, so bold, all day long! That\u0027s where it cuts. What\u0027s the damage, John?\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ll damage you,\u0027 said John, \u0027if you inquire. Dot! Very near?\u0027 \u0027Well! it\u0027s like you to say so,\u0027 observed the little man. \u0027It\u0027s your kind way. Let me see. I think that\u0027s all.\u0027 \u0027I think not,\u0027 said the Carrier. \u0027Try again.\u0027 \u0027Something for our Governor, eh?\u0027 said Caleb, after pondering a little while. \u0027To be sure. That\u0027s what I came for; but my head\u0027s so running on them Arks and things! He hasn\u0027t been here, has he?\u0027 \u0027Not he,\u0027 returned the Carrier. \u0027He\u0027s too busy, courting.\u0027 \u0027He\u0027s coming round though,\u0027 said Caleb; \u0027for he told me to keep on the near side of the road going home, and it was ten to one he\u0027d take me up. I had better go, by the bye. - You couldn\u0027t have the goodness to let me pinch Boxer\u0027s tail, Mum, for half a moment, could you?\u0027 \u0027Why, Caleb! what a question!\u0027 \u0027Oh never mind, Mum,\u0027 said the little man. \u0027He mightn\u0027t like it perhaps. There\u0027s a small order just come in, for barking dogs; and I should wish to go as close to Natur\u0027 as I could, for sixpence. That\u0027s all. Never mind, Mum.\u0027 It happened opportunely, that Boxer, without receiving the proposed stimulus, began to bark with great zeal. But, as this implied the approach of some new visitor, Caleb, postponing his study from the life to a more convenient season, shouldered the round box, and took a hurried leave. He might have spared himself the trouble, for he met the visitor upon the 17 threshold. \u0027Oh! You are here, are you? Wait a bit. I\u0027ll take you home. John Peerybingle, my service to you. More of my service to your pretty wife. Handsomer every day! Better too, if possible! And younger,\u0027 mused the speaker, in a low voice; \u0027that\u0027s the Devil of it!\u0027 \u0027I should be astonished at your paying compliments, Mr. Tackleton,\u0027 said Dot, not with the best grace in the world; \u0027but for your condition.\u0027 \u0027You know all about it then?\u0027 \u0027I have got myself to believe it, somehow,\u0027 said Dot. \u0027After a hard struggle, I suppose?\u0027 \u0027Very.\u0027 Tackleton the Toy-merchant, pretty generally known as Gruff and Tackleton - for that was the firm, though Gruff had been bought out long ago; only leaving his name, and as some said his nature, according to its Dictionary meaning, in the business - Tackleton the Toy-merchant, was a man whose vocation had been quite misunderstood by his Parents and Guardians. If they had made him a Money Lender, or a sharp Attorney, or a Sheriff\u0027s Officer, or a Broker, he might have sown his discontented oats in his youth, and, after having had the full run of himself in ill-natured transactions, might have turned out amiable, at last, for the sake of a little freshness and novelty. But, cramped and chafing in the peaceable pursuit of toy-making, he was a domestic Ogre, who had been living on children all his life, and was their implacable enemy. He despised all toys; wouldn\u0027t have bought one for the world; delighted, in his malice, to insinuate grim expressions into the faces of brown-paper farmers who drove pigs to market, bellmen who advertised lost lawyers\u0027 consciences, movable old ladies who darned stockings or carved pies; and other like samples of his stock in trade. In appalling masks; hideous, hairy, red-eyed Jacks in Boxes; Vampire Kites; demoniacal Tumblers who wouldn\u0027t lie down, and were perpetually flying forward, to stare infants out of countenance; his soul perfectly revelled. They were his only relief, and safety-valve. He was great in such inventions. Anything suggestive of a Pony-nightmare was delicious to him. He had even lost money (and he took to that toy very kindly) by getting up Goblin slides for magic-lanterns, 18 whereon the Powers of Darkness were depicted as a sort of supernatural shell-fish, with human faces. In intensifying the portraiture of Giants, he had sunk quite a little capital; and, though no painter himself, he could indicate, for the instruction of his artists, with a piece of chalk, a certain furtive leer for the countenances of those monsters, which was safe to destroy the peace of mind of any young gentleman between the ages of six and eleven, for the whole Christmas or Midsummer Vacation. What he was in toys, he was (as most men are) in other things. You may easily suppose, therefore, that within the great green cape, which reached down to the calves of his legs, there was buttoned up to the chin an uncommonly pleasant fellow; and that he was about as choice a spirit, and as agreeable a companion, as ever stood in a pair of bull-headedlooking boots with mahogany-coloured tops. Still, Tackleton, the toy-merchant, was going to be married. In spite of all this, he was going to be married. And to a young wife too, a beautiful young wife. He didn\u0027t look much like a bridegroom, as he stood in the Carrier\u0027s kitchen, with a twist in his dry face, and a screw in his body, and his hat jerked over the bridge of his nose, and his hands tucked down into the bottoms of his pockets, and his whole sarcastic ill- conditioned self peering out of one little corner of one little eye, like the concentrated essence of any number of ravens. But, a Bridegroom he designed to be. \u0027In three days\u0027 time. Next Thursday. The last day of the first month in the year. That\u0027s my wedding-day,\u0027 said Tackleton. Did I mention that he had always one eye wide open, and one eye nearly shut; and that the one eye nearly shut, was always the expressive eye? I don\u0027t think I did. \u0027That\u0027s my wedding-day!\u0027 said Tackleton, rattling his money. \u0027Why, it\u0027s our wedding-day too,\u0027 exclaimed the Carrier. \u0027Ha ha!\u0027 laughed Tackleton. \u0027Odd! You\u0027re just such another couple. Just!\u0027 The indignation of Dot at this presumptuous assertion is not to be described. What next? His imagination would compass the possibility of just such another Baby, perhaps. The man was mad. \u0027I say! A word 19 with you,\u0027 murmured Tackleton, nudging the Carrier with his elbow, and taking him a little apart. \u0027You\u0027ll come to the wedding? We\u0027re in the same boat, you know.\u0027 \u0027How in the same boat?\u0027 inquired the Carrier. \u0027A little disparity, you know,\u0027 said Tackleton, with another nudge. \u0027Come and spend an evening with us, beforehand.\u0027 \u0027Why?\u0027 demanded John, astonished at this pressing hospitality. \u0027Why?\u0027 returned the other. \u0027That\u0027s a new way of receiving an invitation. Why, for pleasure - sociability, you know, and all that!\u0027 \u0027I thought you were never sociable,\u0027 said John, in his plain way. \u0027Tchah! It\u0027s of no use to be anything but free with you, I see,\u0027 said Tackleton. \u0027Why, then, the truth is you have a - what tea- drinking people call a sort of a comfortable appearance together, you and your wife. We know better, you know, but - \u0027 \u0027No, we don\u0027t know better,\u0027 interposed John. \u0027What are you talking about?\u0027 \u0027Well! We DON\u0027T know better, then,\u0027 said Tackleton. \u0027We\u0027ll agree that we don\u0027t. As you like; what does it matter? I was going to say, as you have that sort of appearance, your company will produce a favourable effect on Mrs. Tackleton that will be. And, though I don\u0027t think your good lady\u0027s very friendly to me, in this matter, still she can\u0027t help herself from falling into my views, for there\u0027s a compactness and cosiness of appearance about her that always tells, even in an indifferent case. You\u0027ll say you\u0027ll come?\u0027 \u0027We have arranged to keep our Wedding-Day (as far as that goes) at home,\u0027 said John. \u0027We have made the promise to ourselves these six months. We think, you see, that home - \u0027 \u0027Bah! what\u0027s home?\u0027 cried Tackleton. \u0027Four walls and a ceiling! (why don\u0027t you kill that Cricket? I would! I always do. I hate their noise.) There are four walls and a ceiling at my house. Come to me!\u0027 \u0027You kill your Crickets, eh?\u0027 said John. \u0027Scrunch \u0027em, sir,\u0027 returned the other, setting his heel heavily on the floor. \u0027You\u0027ll say you\u0027ll come? it\u0027s as much your interest as mine, you know, that the women should persuade each other that they\u0027re quiet and 20 contented, and couldn\u0027t be better off. I know their way. Whatever one woman says, another woman is determined to clinch, always. There\u0027s that spirit of emulation among \u0027em, sir, that if your wife says to my wife, \"I\u0027m the happiest woman in the world, and mine\u0027s the best husband in the world, and I dote on him,\" my wife will say the same to yours, or more, and half believe it.\u0027 \u0027Do you mean to say she don\u0027t, then?\u0027 asked the Carrier. \u0027Don\u0027t!\u0027 cried Tackleton, with a short, sharp laugh. \u0027Don\u0027t what?\u0027 The Carrier had some faint idea of adding, \u0027dote upon you.\u0027 But, happening to meet the half-closed eye, as it twinkled upon him over the turned-up collar of the cape, which was within an ace of poking it out, he felt it such an unlikely part and parcel of anything to be doted on, that he substituted, \u0027that she don\u0027t believe it?\u0027 \u0027Ah you dog! You\u0027re joking,\u0027 said Tackleton. But the Carrier, though slow to understand the full drift of his meaning, eyed him in such a serious manner, that he was obliged to be a little more explanatory. \u0027I have the humour,\u0027 said Tackleton: holding up the fingers of his left hand, and tapping the forefinger, to imply \u0027there I am, Tackleton to wit:\u0027 \u0027I have the humour, sir, to marry a young wife, and a pretty wife:\u0027 here he rapped his little finger, to express the Bride; not sparingly, but sharply; with a sense of power. \u0027I\u0027m able to gratify that humour and I do. It\u0027s my whim. But - now look there!\u0027 He pointed to where Dot was sitting, thoughtfully, before the fire; leaning her dimpled chin upon her hand, and watching the bright blaze. The Carrier looked at her, and then at him, and then at her, and then at him again. \u0027She honours and obeys, no doubt, you know,\u0027 said Tackleton; \u0027and that, as I am not a man of sentiment, is quite enough for ME. But do you think there\u0027s anything more in it?\u0027 \u0027I think,\u0027 observed the Carrier, \u0027that I should chuck any man out of window, who said there wasn\u0027t.\u0027 \u0027Exactly so,\u0027 returned the other with an unusual alacrity of assent. \u0027To be sure! Doubtless you would. Of course. I\u0027m certain of it. Good 21 night. Pleasant dreams!\u0027 The Carrier was puzzled, and made uncomfortable and uncertain, in spite of himself. He couldn\u0027t help showing it, in his manner. \u0027Good night, my dear friend!\u0027 said Tackleton, compassionately. \u0027I\u0027m off. We\u0027re exactly alike, in reality, I see. You won\u0027t give us to-morrow evening? Well! Next day you go out visiting, I know. I\u0027ll meet you there, and bring my wife that is to be. It\u0027ll do her good. You\u0027re agreeable? Thank\u0027ee. What\u0027s that!\u0027 It was a loud cry from the Carrier\u0027s wife: a loud, sharp, sudden cry, that made the room ring, like a glass vessel. She had risen from her seat, and stood like one transfixed by terror and surprise. The Stranger had advanced towards the fire to warm himself, and stood within a short stride of her chair. But quite still. \u0027Dot!\u0027 cried the Carrier. \u0027Mary! Darling! What\u0027s the matter?\u0027 They were all about her in a moment. Caleb, who had been dozing on the cake-box, in the first imperfect recovery of his suspended presence of mind, seized Miss Slowboy by the hair of her head, but immediately apologised. \u0027Mary!\u0027 exclaimed the Carrier, supporting her in his arms. \u0027Are you ill! What is it? Tell me, dear!\u0027 She only answered by beating her hands together, and falling into a wild fit of laughter. Then, sinking from his grasp upon the ground, she covered her face with her apron, and wept bitterly. And then she laughed again, and then she cried again, and then she said how cold it was, and suffered him to lead her to the fire, where she sat down as before. The old man standing, as before, quite still. \u0027I\u0027m better, John,\u0027 she said. \u0027I\u0027m quite well now - I -\u0027 \u0027John!\u0027 But John was on the other side of her. Why turn her face towards the strange old gentleman, as if addressing him! Was her brain wandering? \u0027Only a fancy, John dear - a kind of shock - a something coming suddenly before my eyes - I don\u0027t know what it was. It\u0027s quite gone, quite gone.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m glad it\u0027s gone,\u0027 muttered Tackleton, turning the expressive eye all 22 round the room. \u0027I wonder where it\u0027s gone, and what it was. Humph! Caleb, come here! Who\u0027s that with the grey hair?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know, sir,\u0027 returned Caleb in a whisper. \u0027Never see him before, in all my life. A beautiful figure for a nut-cracker; quite a new model. With a screw-jaw opening down into his waistcoat, he\u0027d be lovely.\u0027 \u0027Not ugly enough,\u0027 said Tackleton. \u0027Or for a firebox, either,\u0027 observed Caleb, in deep contemplation, \u0027what a model! Unscrew his head to put the matches in; turn him heels up\u0027ards for the light; and what a firebox for a gentleman\u0027s mantel-shelf, just as he stands!\u0027 \u0027Not half ugly enough,\u0027 said Tackleton. \u0027Nothing in him at all! Come! Bring that box! All right now, I hope?\u0027 \u0027Quite gone!\u0027 said the little woman, waving him hurriedly away. \u0027Good night!\u0027 \u0027Good night,\u0027 said Tackleton. \u0027Good night, John Peerybingle! Take care how you carry that box, Caleb. Let it fall, and I\u0027ll murder you! Dark as pitch, and weather worse than ever, eh? Good night!\u0027 So, with another sharp look round the room, he went out at the door; followed by Caleb with the wedding-cake on his head. The Carrier had been so much astounded by his little wife, and so busily engaged in soothing and tending her, that he had scarcely been conscious of the Stranger\u0027s presence, until now, when he again stood there, their only guest. \u0027He don\u0027t belong to them, you see,\u0027 said John. \u0027I must give him a hint to go.\u0027 \u0027I beg your pardon, friend,\u0027 said the old gentleman, advancing to him; \u0027the more so, as I fear your wife has not been well; but the Attendant whom my infirmity,\u0027 he touched his ears and shook his head, \u0027renders almost indispensable, not having arrived, I fear there must be some mistake. The bad night which made the shelter of your comfortable cart (may I never have a worse!) so acceptable, is still as bad as ever. Would you, in your kindness, suffer me to rent a bed here?\u0027 \u0027Yes, yes,\u0027 cried Dot. \u0027Yes! Certainly!\u0027 \u0027Oh!\u0027 said the Carrier, surprised by the rapidity of this consent. 23 \u0027Well! I don\u0027t object; but, still I\u0027m not quite sure that - \u0027 \u0027Hush!\u0027 she interrupted. \u0027Dear John!\u0027 \u0027Why, he\u0027s stone deaf,\u0027 urged John. \u0027I know he is, but - Yes, sir, certainly. Yes! certainly! I\u0027ll make him up a bed, directly, John.\u0027 As she hurried off to do it, the flutter of her spirits, and the agitation of her manner, were so strange that the Carrier stood looking after her, quite confounded. \u0027Did its mothers make it up a Beds then!\u0027 cried Miss Slowboy to the Baby; \u0027and did its hair grow brown and curly, when its caps was lifted off, and frighten it, a precious Pets, a-sitting by the fires!\u0027 With that unaccountable attraction of the mind to trifles, which is often incidental to a state of doubt and confusion, the Carrier as he walked slowly to and fro, found himself mentally repeating even these absurd words, many times. So many times that he got them by heart, and was still conning them over and over, like a lesson, when Tilly, after administering as much friction to the little bald head with her hand as she thought wholesome (according to the practice of nurses), had once more tied the Baby\u0027s cap on. \u0027And frighten it, a precious Pets, a-sitting by the fires. What frightened Dot, I wonder!\u0027 mused the Carrier, pacing to and fro. He scouted, from his heart, the insinuations of the Toy-merchant, and yet they filled him with a vague, indefinite uneasiness. For, Tackleton was quick and sly; and he had that painful sense, himself, of being of slow perception, that a broken hint was always worrying to him. He certainly had no intention in his mind of linking anything that Tackleton had said, with the unusual conduct of his wife, but the two subjects of reflection came into his mind together, and he could not keep them asunder. The bed was soon made ready; and the visitor, declining all refreshment but a cup of tea, retired. Then, Dot - quite well again, she said, quite well again - arranged the great chair in the chimney-corner for her husband; filled his pipe and gave it him; and took her usual little stool beside him on the hearth. She always WOULD sit on that little stool. I think she must have had 24 a kind of notion that it was a coaxing, wheedling little stool. She was, out and out, the very best filler of a pipe, I should say, in the four quarters of the globe. To see her put that chubby little finger in the bowl, and then blow down the pipe to clear the tube, and, when she had done so, affect to think that there was really something in the tube, and blow a dozen times, and hold it to her eye like a telescope, with a most provoking twist in her capital little face, as she looked down it, was quite a brilliant thing. As to the tobacco, she was perfect mistress of the subject; and her lighting of the pipe, with a wisp of paper, when the Carrier had it in his mouth - going so very near his nose, and yet not scorching it - was Art, high Art. And the Cricket and the kettle, turning up again, acknowledged it! The bright fire, blazing up again, acknowledged it! The little Mower on the clock, in his unheeded work, acknowledged it! The Carrier, in his smoothing forehead and expanding face, acknowledged it, the readiest of all. And as he soberly and thoughtfully puffed at his old pipe, and as the Dutch clock ticked, and as the red fire gleamed, and as the Cricket chirped; that Genius of his Hearth and Home (for such the Cricket was) came out, in fairy shape, into the room, and summoned many forms of Home about him. Dots of all ages, and all sizes, filled the chamber. Dots who were merry children, running on before him gathering flowers, in the fields; coy Dots, half shrinking from, half yielding to, the pleading of his own rough image; newly-married Dots, alighting at the door, and taking wondering possession of the household keys; motherly little Dots, attended by fictitious Slowboys, bearing babies to be christened; matronly Dots, still young and blooming, watching Dots of daughters, as they danced at rustic balls; fat Dots, encircled and beset by troops of rosy grandchildren; withered Dots, who leaned on sticks, and tottered as they crept along. Old Carriers too, appeared, with blind old Boxers lying at their feet; and newer carts with younger drivers (\u0027Peerybingle Brothers\u0027 on the tilt); and sick old Carriers, tended by the gentlest hands; and graves of dead and gone old Carriers, green in the churchyard. And as the Cricket showed him all these things -he saw them plainly, though his eyes were fixed 25 upon the fire - the Carrier\u0027s heart grew light and happy, and he thanked his Household Gods with all his might, and cared no more for Gruff and Tackleton than you do. But, what was that young figure of a man, which the same Fairy Cricket set so near Her stool, and which remained there, singly and alone? Why did it linger still, so near her, with its arm upon the chimney-piece, ever repeating \u0027Married! and not to me!\u0027 O Dot! O failing Dot! There is no place for it in all your husband\u0027s visions; why has its shadow fallen on his hearth! \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3325/91046.html","bookId":256,"book":{"id":256,"title":"The Cricket on the Hearth","description":"简介： 货运工约翰的妻子、善良的主妇多特相信，壁炉边的蟋蟀是捍卫自家家宅的小小神灵。这是一桩不被看好的婚姻，靠运货为生的约翰比多特要年长许多，他粗壮笨拙，多特则娇小可爱，朋友们围绕在多特身边，大家虽皆不富足，却因为拥有多特这样特殊的朋友，在团聚时充满欢声笑语...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201907/29/09-53-10-19-1.jpg","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3325","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:28 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:28 AM"}}
