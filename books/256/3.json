{"id":7743,"no":3,"title":"CHAPTER III - Chirp the Third","content":"THE Dutch clock in the corner struck Ten, when the Carrier sat down by his fireside. So troubled and grief-worn, that he seemed to scare the Cuckoo, who, having cut his ten melodious announcements as short as possible, plunged back into the Moorish Palace again, and clapped his little door behind him, as if the unwonted spectacle were too much for his feelings. If the little Haymaker had been armed with the sharpest of scythes, and had cut at every stroke into the Carrier\u0027s heart, he never could have gashed and wounded it, as Dot had done. It was a heart so full of love for her; so bound up and held together by innumerable threads of winning remembrance, spun from the daily working of her many qualities of endearment; it was a heart in which she had enshrined herself so gently and so closely; a heart so single and so earnest in its Truth, so strong in right, so weak in wrong; that it could cherish neither passion nor revenge at first, and had only room to hold the broken image of its Idol. But, slowly, slowly, as the Carrier sat brooding on his hearth, now cold and dark, other and fiercer thoughts began to rise within him, as an angry wind comes rising in the night. The Stranger was beneath his outraged roof. Three steps would take him to his chamber-door. One blow would beat it in. \u0027You might do murder before you know it,\u0027 Tackleton had said. How could it be murder, if he gave the villain time to grapple with him hand to hand! He was the younger man. It was an ill-timed thought, bad for the dark mood of his mind. It was an angry thought, goading him to some avenging act, that should change the cheerful house into a haunted place which lonely travellers would dread to pass by night; and where the timid would see shadows struggling in the ruined windows when the moon was dim, and hear wild noises in the stormy weather. He was the younger man! Yes, yes; some lover who had won the heart that HE had never touched. Some lover of her early choice, of 55 whom she had thought and dreamed, for whom she had pined and pined, when he had fancied her so happy by his side. O agony to think of it! She had been above-stairs with the Baby, getting it to bed. As he sat brooding on the hearth, she came close beside him, without his knowledge - in the turning of the rack of his great misery, he lost all other sounds and put her little stool at his feet. He only knew it, when he felt her hand upon his own, and saw her looking up into his face. With wonder? No. It was his first impression, and he was fain to look at her again, to set it right. No, not with wonder. With an eager and inquiring look; but not with wonder. At first it was alarmed and serious; then, it changed into a strange, wild, dreadful smile of recognition of his thoughts; then, there was nothing but her clasped hands on her brow, and her bent head, and falling hair. Though the power of Omnipotence had been his to wield at that moment, he had too much of its diviner property of Mercy in his breast, to have turned one feather\u0027s weight of it against her. But he could not bear to see her crouching down upon the little seat where he had often looked on her, with love and pride, so innocent and gay; and, when she rose and left him, sobbing as she went, he felt it a relief to have the vacant place beside him rather than her so long-cherished presence. This in itself was anguish keener than all, reminding him how desolate he was become, and how the great bond of his life was rent asunder. The more he felt this, and the more he knew he could have better borne to see her lying prematurely dead before him with their little child upon her breast, the higher and the stronger rose his wrath against his enemy. He looked about him for a weapon. There was a gun, hanging on the wall. He took it down, and moved a pace or two towards the door of the perfidious Stranger\u0027s room. He knew the gun was loaded. Some shadowy idea that it was just to shoot this man like a wild beast, seized him, and dilated in his mind until it grew into a monstrous demon in complete possession of him, casting out all milder thoughts and setting up its undivided empire. That phrase is wrong. Not casting out his milder thoughts, but artfully transforming them. Changing them into scourges to drive him on. 56 Turning water into blood, love into hate, gentleness into blind ferocity. Her image, sorrowing, humbled, but still pleading to his tenderness and mercy with resistless power, never left his mind; but, staying there, it urged him to the door; raised the weapon to his shoulder; fitted and nerved his finger to the trigger; and cried \u0027Kill him! In his bed!\u0027 He reversed the gun to beat the stock up the door; he already held it lifted in the air; some indistinct design was in his thoughts of calling out to him to fly, for God\u0027s sake, by the window When, suddenly, the struggling fire illumined the whole chimney with a glow of light; and began to Chirp! No sound he could have heard, no human voice, not even hers, could so have moved and softened him. The artless words in which she had told him of her love for this same Cricket, were once more freshly spoken; her trembling, earnest manner at the moment, was again before him; her pleasant voice - O what a voice it was, for making household music at the fireside of an honest man! - thrilled through and through his better nature, and awoke it into life and action. He recoiled from the door, like a man walking in his sleep, awakened from a frightful dream; and put the gun aside. Clasping his hands before his face, he then sat down again beside the fire, and found relief in tears. came out into the room, and stood in Fairy shape before him. \u0027\"I love it,\"\u0027 said the Fairy Voice, repeating what he well remembered, \u0027\"for the many times I have heard it, and the many thoughts its harmless music has given me.\"\u0027 \u0027She said so!\u0027 cried the Carrier. \u0027True!\u0027 \u0027\"This has been a happy home, John; and I love the Cricket for its sake!\"\u0027 \u0027It has been, Heaven knows,\u0027 returned the Carrier. \u0027She made it happy, always, - until now.\u0027 \u0027So gracefully sweet-tempered; so domestic, joyful, busy, and lighthearted!\u0027 said the Voice. \u0027Otherwise I never could have loved her as I did,\u0027 returned the Carrier. The Voice, correcting him, said \u0027do.\u0027 57 The Carrier repeated \u0027as I did.\u0027 But not firmly. His faltering tongue resisted his control, and would speak in its own way, for itself and him. The Figure, in an attitude of invocation, raised its hand and said: \u0027Upon your own hearth - \u0027 \u0027The hearth she has blighted,\u0027 interposed the Carrier. \u0027The hearth she has - how often! - blessed and brightened,\u0027 said the Cricket; \u0027the hearth which, but for her, were only a few stones and bricks and rusty bars, but which has been, through her, the Altar of your Home; on which you have nightly sacrificed some petty passion, selfishness, or care, and offered up the homage of a tranquil mind, a trusting nature, and an overflowing heart; so that the smoke from this poor chimney has gone upward with a better fragrance than the richest incense that is burnt before the richest shrines in all the gaudy temples of this world! - Upon your own hearth; in its quiet sanctuary; surrounded by its gentle influences and associations; hear her! Hear me! Hear everything that speaks the language of your hearth and home!\u0027 \u0027And pleads for her?\u0027 inquired the Carrier. \u0027All things that speak the language of your hearth and home, must plead for her!\u0027 returned the Cricket. \u0027For they speak the truth.\u0027 And while the Carrier, with his head upon his hands, continued to sit meditating in his chair, the Presence stood beside him, suggesting his reflections by its power, and presenting them before him, as in a glass or picture. It was not a solitary Presence. From the hearthstone, from the chimney, from the clock, the pipe, the kettle, and the cradle; from the floor, the walls, the ceiling, and the stairs; from the cart without, and the cupboard within, and the household implements; from every thing and every place with which she had ever been familiar, and with which she had ever entwined one recollection of herself in her unhappy husband\u0027s mind; Fairies came trooping forth. Not to stand beside him as the Cricket did, but to busy and bestir themselves. To do all honour to her image. To pull him by the skirts, and point to it when it appeared. To cluster round it, and embrace it, and strew flowers for it to tread on. To try to crown its fair head with their tiny hands. To show that they were fond of it and loved it; and that there was not one ugly, wicked or accusatory 58 creature to claim knowledge of it -none but their playful and approving selves. His thoughts were constant to her image. It was always there. She sat plying her needle, before the fire, and singing to herself. Such a blithe, thriving, steady little Dot! The fairy figures turned upon him all at once, by one consent, with one prodigious concentrated stare, and seemed to say, \u0027Is this the light wife you are mourning for!\u0027 There were sounds of gaiety outside, musical instruments, and noisy tongues, and laughter. A crowd of young merry-makers came pouring in, among whom were May Fielding and a score of pretty girls. Dot was the fairest of them all; as young as any of them too. They came to summon her to join their party. It was a dance. If ever little foot were made for dancing, hers was, surely. But she laughed, and shook her head, and pointed to her cookery on the fire, and her table ready spread: with an exulting defiance that rendered her more charming than she was before. And so she merrily dismissed them, nodding to her would-be partners, one by one, as they passed, but with a comical indifference, enough to make them go and drown themselves immediately if they were her admirers and they must have been so, more or less; they couldn\u0027t help it. And yet indifference was not her character. O no! For presently, there came a certain Carrier to the door; and bless her what a welcome she bestowed upon him! Again the staring figures turned upon him all at once, and seemed to say, \u0027Is this the wife who has forsaken you!\u0027 A shadow fell upon the mirror or the picture: call it what you will. A great shadow of the Stranger, as he first stood underneath their roof; covering its surface, and blotting out all other objects. But the nimble Fairies worked like bees to clear it off again. And Dot again was there. Still bright and beautiful. Rocking her little Baby in its cradle, singing to it softly, and resting her head upon a shoulder which had its counterpart in the musing figure by which the Fairy Cricket stood. The night -I mean the real night: not going by Fairy clocks - was wearing now; and in this stage of the Carrier\u0027s thoughts, the moon burst 59 out, and shone brightly in the sky. Perhaps some calm and quiet light had risen also, in his mind; and he could think more soberly of what had happened. Although the shadow of the Stranger fell at intervals upon the glass always distinct, and big, and thoroughly defined - it never fell so darkly as at first. Whenever it appeared, the Fairies uttered a general cry of consternation, and plied their little arms and legs, with inconceivable activity, to rub it out. And whenever they got at Dot again, and showed her to him once more, bright and beautiful, they cheered in the most inspiring manner. They never showed her, otherwise than beautiful and bright, for they were Household Spirits to whom falsehood is annihilation; and being so, what Dot was there for them, but the one active, beaming, pleasant little creature who had been the light and sun of the Carrier\u0027s Home! The Fairies were prodigiously excited when they showed her, with the Baby, gossiping among a knot of sage old matrons, and affecting to be wondrous old and matronly herself, and leaning in a staid, demure old way upon her husband\u0027s arm, attempting - she! such a bud of a little woman - to convey the idea of having abjured the vanities of the world in general, and of being the sort of person to whom it was no novelty at all to be a mother; yet in the same breath, they showed her, laughing at the Carrier for being awkward, and pulling up his shirt-collar to make him smart, and mincing merrily about that very room to teach him how to dance! They turned, and stared immensely at him when they showed her with the Blind Girl; for, though she carried cheerfulness and animation with her wheresoever she went, she bore those influences into Caleb Plummer\u0027s home, heaped up and running over. The Blind Girl\u0027s love for her, and trust in her, and gratitude to her; her own good busy way of setting Bertha\u0027s thanks aside; her dexterous little arts for filling up each moment of the visit in doing something useful to the house, and really working hard while feigning to make holiday; her bountiful provision of those standing delicacies, the Veal and Ham-Pie and the bottles of Beer; her radiant little face arriving at the door, and taking leave; the wonderful expression in her whole self, from her neat foot to the crown of her head, 60 of being a part of the establishment - a something necessary to it, which it couldn\u0027t be without; all this the Fairies revelled in, and loved her for. And once again they looked upon him all at once, appealingly, and seemed to say, while some among them nestled in her dress and fondled her, \u0027Is this the wife who has betrayed your confidence!\u0027 More than once, or twice, or thrice, in the long thoughtful night, they showed her to him sitting on her favourite seat, with her bent head, her hands clasped on her brow, her falling hair. As he had seen her last. And when they found her thus, they neither turned nor looked upon him, but gathered close round her, and comforted and kissed her, and pressed on one another to show sympathy and kindness to her, and forgot him altogether. Thus the night passed. The moon went down; the stars grew pale; the cold day broke; the sun rose. The Carrier still sat, musing, in the chimney corner. He had sat there, with his head upon his hands, all night. All night the faithful Cricket had been Chirp, Chirp, Chirping on the Hearth. All night he had listened to its voice. All night the household Fairies had been busy with him. All night she had been amiable and blameless in the glass, except when that one shadow fell upon it. He rose up when it was broad day, and washed and dressed himself. He couldn\u0027t go about his customary cheerful avocations - he wanted spirit for them - but it mattered the less, that it was Tackleton\u0027s wedding-day, and he had arranged to make his rounds by proxy. He thought to have gone merrily to church with Dot. But such plans were at an end. It was their own wedding-day too. Ah! how little he had looked for such a close to such a year! The Carrier had expected that Tackleton would pay him an early visit; and he was right. He had not walked to and fro before his own door, many minutes, when he saw the Toy-merchant coming in his chaise along the road. As the chaise drew nearer, he perceived that Tackleton was dressed out sprucely for his marriage, and that he had decorated his horse\u0027s head with flowers and favours. The horse looked much more like a bridegroom than Tackleton, whose half-closed eye was more disagreeably expressive than ever. But the 61 Carrier took little heed of this. His thoughts had other occupation. \u0027John Peerybingle!\u0027 said Tackleton, with an air of condolence. \u0027My good fellow, how do you find yourself this morning?\u0027 \u0027I have had but a poor night, Master Tackleton,\u0027 returned the Carrier, shaking his head: \u0027for I have been a good deal disturbed in my mind. But it\u0027s over now! Can you spare me half an hour or so, for some private talk?\u0027 \u0027I came on purpose,\u0027 returned Tackleton, alighting. \u0027Never mind the horse. He\u0027ll stand quiet enough, with the reins over this post, if you\u0027ll give him a mouthful of hay.\u0027 The Carrier having brought it from his stable, and set it before him, they turned into the house. \u0027You are not married before noon,\u0027 he said, \u0027I think?\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 answered Tackleton. \u0027Plenty of time. Plenty of time.\u0027 When they entered the kitchen, Tilly Slowboy was rapping at the Stranger\u0027s door; which was only removed from it by a few steps. One of her very red eyes (for Tilly had been crying all night long, because her mistress cried) was at the keyhole; and she was knocking very loud; and seemed frightened. \u0027If you please I can\u0027t make nobody hear,\u0027 said Tilly, looking round. \u0027I hope nobody an\u0027t gone and been and died if you please!\u0027 This philanthropic wish, Miss Slowboy emphasised with various new raps and kicks at the door; which led to no result whatever. \u0027Shall I go?\u0027 said Tackleton. \u0027It\u0027s curious.\u0027 The Carrier, who had turned his face from the door, signed to him to go if he would. So Tackleton went to Tilly Slowboy\u0027s relief; and he too kicked and knocked; and he too failed to get the least reply. But he thought of trying the handle of the door; and as it opened easily, he peeped in, looked in, went in, and soon came running out again. \u0027John Peerybingle,\u0027 said Tackleton, in his ear. \u0027I hope there has been nothing - nothing rash in the night?\u0027 The Carrier turned upon him quickly. \u0027Because he\u0027s gone!\u0027 said Tackleton; \u0027and the window\u0027s open. I don\u0027t 62 see any marks - to be sure it\u0027s almost on a level with the garden: but I was afraid there might have been some - some scuffle. Eh?\u0027 He nearly shut up the expressive eye altogether; he looked at him so hard. And he gave his eye, and his face, and his whole person, a sharp twist. As if he would have screwed the truth out of him. \u0027Make yourself easy,\u0027 said the Carrier. \u0027He went into that room last night, without harm in word or deed from me, and no one has entered it since. He is away of his own free will. I\u0027d go out gladly at that door, and beg my bread from house to house, for life, if I could so change the past that he had never come. But he has come and gone. And I have done with him!\u0027 \u0027Oh! - Well, I think he has got off pretty easy,\u0027 said Tackleton, taking a chair. The sneer was lost upon the Carrier, who sat down too, and shaded his face with his hand, for some little time, before proceeding. \u0027You showed me last night,\u0027 he said at length, \u0027my wife; my wife that I love; secretly - \u0027 \u0027And tenderly,\u0027 insinuated Tackleton. \u0027Conniving at that man\u0027s disguise, and giving him opportunities of meeting her alone. I think there\u0027s no sight I wouldn\u0027t have rather seen than that. I think there\u0027s no man in the world I wouldn\u0027t have rather had to show it me.\u0027 \u0027I confess to having had my suspicions always,\u0027 said Tackleton. \u0027And that has made me objectionable here, I know.\u0027 \u0027But as you did show it me,\u0027 pursued the Carrier, not minding him; \u0027and as you saw her, my wife, my wife that I love\u0027 - his voice, and eye, and hand, grew steadier and firmer as he repeated these words: evidently in pursuance of a steadfast purpose - \u0027as you saw her at this disadvantage, it is right and just that you should also see with my eyes, and look into my breast, and know what my mind is, upon the subject. For it\u0027s settled,\u0027 said the Carrier, regarding him attentively. \u0027And nothing can shake it now.\u0027 Tackleton muttered a few general words of assent, about its being necessary to vindicate something or other; but he was overawed by the manner of his companion. Plain and unpolished as it was, it had a 63 something dignified and noble in it, which nothing but the soul of generous honour dwelling in the man could have imparted. \u0027I am a plain, rough man,\u0027 pursued the Carrier, \u0027with very little to recommend me. I am not a clever man, as you very well know. I am not a young man. I loved my little Dot, because I had seen her grow up, from a child, in her father\u0027s house; because I knew how precious she was; because she had been my life, for years and years. There\u0027s many men I can\u0027t compare with, who never could have loved my little Dot like me, I think!\u0027 He paused, and softly beat the ground a short time with his foot, before resuming. \u0027I often thought that though I wasn\u0027t good enough for her, I should make her a kind husband, and perhaps know her value better than another; and in this way I reconciled it to myself, and came to think it might be possible that we should be married. And in the end it came about, and we were married.\u0027 \u0027Hah!\u0027 said Tackleton, with a significant shake of the head. \u0027I had studied myself; I had had experience of myself; I knew how much I loved her, and how happy I should be,\u0027 pursued the Carrier. \u0027But I had not - I feel it now - sufficiently considered her.\u0027 \u0027To be sure,\u0027 said Tackleton. \u0027Giddiness, frivolity, fickleness, love of admiration! Not considered! All left out of sight! Hah!\u0027 \u0027You had best not interrupt me,\u0027 said the Carrier, with some sternness, \u0027till you understand me; and you\u0027re wide of doing so. If, yesterday, I\u0027d have struck that man down at a blow, who dared to breathe a word against her, to-day I\u0027d set my foot upon his face, if he was my brother!\u0027 The Toy-merchant gazed at him in astonishment. He went on in a softer tone: \u0027Did I consider,\u0027 said the Carrier, \u0027that I took her - at her age, and with her beauty - from her young companions, and the many scenes of which she was the ornament; in which she was the brightest little star that ever shone, to shut her up from day to day in my dull house, and keep my tedious company? Did I consider how little suited I was to her sprightly humour, and how wearisome a plodding man like me must be, to one of 64 her quick spirit? Did I consider that it was no merit in me, or claim in me, that I loved her, when everybody must, who knew her? Never. I took advantage of her hopeful nature and her cheerful disposition; and I married her. I wish I never had! For her sake; not for mine!\u0027 The Toy-merchant gazed at him, without winking. Even the half-shut eye was open now. \u0027Heaven bless her!\u0027 said the Carrier, \u0027for the cheerful constancy with which she tried to keep the knowledge of this from me! And Heaven help me, that, in my slow mind, I have not found it out before! Poor child! Poor Dot! I not to find it out, who have seen her eyes fill with tears, when such a marriage as our own was spoken of! I, who have seen the secret trembling on her lips a hundred times, and never suspected it till last night! Poor girl! That I could ever hope she would be fond of me! That I could ever believe she was!\u0027 \u0027She made a show of it,\u0027 said Tackleton. \u0027She made such a show of it, that to tell you the truth it was the origin of my misgivings.\u0027 And here he asserted the superiority of May Fielding, who certainly made no sort of show of being fond of HIM. \u0027She has tried,\u0027 said the poor Carrier, with greater emotion than he had exhibited yet; \u0027I only now begin to know how hard she has tried, to be my dutiful and zealous wife. How good she has been; how much she has done; how brave and strong a heart she has; let the happiness I have known under this roof bear witness! It will be some help and comfort to me, when I am here alone.\u0027 \u0027Here alone?\u0027 said Tackleton. \u0027Oh! Then you do mean to take some notice of this?\u0027 \u0027I mean,\u0027 returned the Carrier, \u0027to do her the greatest kindness, and make her the best reparation, in my power. I can release her from the daily pain of an unequal marriage, and the struggle to conceal it. She shall be as free as I can render her.\u0027 \u0027Make HER reparation!\u0027 exclaimed Tackleton, twisting and turning his great ears with his hands. \u0027There must be something wrong here. You didn\u0027t say that, of course.\u0027 The Carrier set his grip upon the collar of the Toy-merchant, and 65 shook him like a reed. \u0027Listen to me!\u0027 he said. \u0027And take care that you hear me right. Listen to me. Do I speak plainly?\u0027 \u0027Very plainly indeed,\u0027 answered Tackleton. \u0027As if I meant it?\u0027 \u0027Very much as if you meant it.\u0027 \u0027I sat upon that hearth, last night, all night,\u0027 exclaimed the Carrier. \u0027On the spot where she has often sat beside me, with her sweet face looking into mine. I called up her whole life, day by day. I had her dear self, in its every passage, in review before me. And upon my soul she is innocent, if there is One to judge the innocent and guilty!\u0027 Staunch Cricket on the Hearth! Loyal household Fairies! \u0027Passion and distrust have left me!\u0027 said the Carrier; \u0027and nothing but my grief remains. In an unhappy moment some old lover, better suited to her tastes and years than I; forsaken, perhaps, for me, against her will; returned. In an unhappy moment, taken by surprise, and wanting time to think of what she did, she made herself a party to his treachery, by concealing it. Last night she saw him, in the interview we witnessed. It was wrong. But otherwise than this she is innocent if there is truth on earth!\u0027 \u0027If that is your opinion\u0027 - Tackleton began. \u0027So, let her go!\u0027 pursued the Carrier. \u0027Go, with my blessing for the many happy hours she has given me, and my forgiveness for any pang she has caused me. Let her go, and have the peace of mind I wish her! She\u0027ll never hate me. She\u0027ll learn to like me better, when I\u0027m not a drag upon her, and she wears the chain I have riveted, more lightly. This is the day on which I took her, with so little thought for her enjoyment, from her home. To-day she shall return to it, and I will trouble her no more. Her father and mother will be here to-day - we had made a little plan for keeping it together - and they shall take her home. I can trust her, there, or anywhere. She leaves me without blame, and she will live so I am sure. If I should die - I may perhaps while she is still young; I have lost some courage in a few hours - she\u0027ll find that I remembered her, and loved her to the last! This is the end of what you showed me. Now, it\u0027s over!\u0027 66 \u0027O no, John, not over. Do not say it\u0027s over yet! Not quite yet. I have heard your noble words. I could not steal away, pretending to be ignorant of what has affected me with such deep gratitude. Do not say it\u0027s over, \u0027till the clock has struck again!\u0027 She had entered shortly after Tackleton, and had remained there. She never looked at Tackleton, but fixed her eyes upon her husband. But she kept away from him, setting as wide a space as possible between them; and though she spoke with most impassioned earnestness, she went no nearer to him even then. How different in this from her old self! \u0027No hand can make the clock which will strike again for me the hours that are gone,\u0027 replied the Carrier, with a faint smile. \u0027But let it be so, if you will, my dear. It will strike soon. It\u0027s of little matter what we say. I\u0027d try to please you in a harder case than that.\u0027 \u0027Well!\u0027 muttered Tackleton. \u0027I must be off, for when the clock strikes again, it\u0027ll be necessary for me to be upon my way to church. Good morning, John Peerybingle. I\u0027m sorry to be deprived of the pleasure of your company. Sorry for the loss, and the occasion of it too!\u0027 \u0027I have spoken plainly?\u0027 said the Carrier, accompanying him to the door. \u0027Oh quite!\u0027 \u0027And you\u0027ll remember what I have said?\u0027 \u0027Why, if you compel me to make the observation,\u0027 said Tackleton, previously taking the precaution of getting into his chaise; \u0027I must say that it was so very unexpected, that I\u0027m far from being likely to forget it.\u0027 \u0027The better for us both,\u0027 returned the Carrier. \u0027Good bye. I give you joy!\u0027 \u0027I wish I could give it to YOU,\u0027 said Tackleton. \u0027As I can\u0027t; thank\u0027ee. Between ourselves, (as I told you before, eh?) I don\u0027t much think I shall have the less joy in my married life, because May hasn\u0027t been too officious about me, and too demonstrative. Good bye! Take care of yourself.\u0027 The Carrier stood looking after him until he was smaller in the distance than his horse\u0027s flowers and favours near at hand; and then, with a deep sigh, went strolling like a restless, broken man, among some neighbouring elms; unwilling to return until the clock was on the eve of 67 striking. His little wife, being left alone, sobbed piteously; but often dried her eyes and checked herself, to say how good he was, how excellent he was! and once or twice she laughed; so heartily, triumphantly, and incoherently (still crying all the time), that Tilly was quite horrified. \u0027Ow if you please don\u0027t!\u0027 said Tilly. \u0027It\u0027s enough to dead and bury the Baby, so it is if you please.\u0027 \u0027Will you bring him sometimes, to see his father, Tilly,\u0027 inquired her mistress, drying her eyes; \u0027when I can\u0027t live here, and have gone to my old home?\u0027 \u0027Ow if you please don\u0027t!\u0027 cried Tilly, throwing back her head, and bursting out into a howl -she looked at the moment uncommonly like Boxer. \u0027Ow if you please don\u0027t! Ow, what has everybody gone and been and done with everybody, making everybody else so wretched! Ow-w-w-w!\u0027 The soft-hearted Slowboy trailed off at this juncture, into such a deplorable howl, the more tremendous from its long suppression, that she must infallibly have awakened the Baby, and frightened him into something serious (probably convulsions), if her eyes had not encountered Caleb Plummer, leading in his daughter. This spectacle restoring her to a sense of the proprieties, she stood for some few moments silent, with her mouth wide open; and then, posting off to the bed on which the Baby lay asleep, danced in a weird, Saint Vitus manner on the floor, and at the same time rummaged with her face and head among the bedclothes, apparently deriving much relief from those extraordinary operations. \u0027Mary!\u0027 said Bertha. \u0027Not at the marriage!\u0027 \u0027I told her you would not be there, mum,\u0027 whispered Caleb. \u0027I heard as much last night. But bless you,\u0027 said the little man, taking her tenderly by both hands, \u0027I don\u0027t care for what they say. I don\u0027t believe them. There an\u0027t much of me, but that little should be torn to pieces sooner than I\u0027d trust a word against you!\u0027 He put his arms about her and hugged her, as a child might have hugged one of his own dolls. \u0027Bertha couldn\u0027t stay at home this morning,\u0027 said Caleb. \u0027She was 68 afraid, I know, to hear the bells ring, and couldn\u0027t trust herself to be so near them on their wedding-day. So we started in good time, and came here. I have been thinking of what I have done,\u0027 said Caleb, after a moment\u0027s pause; \u0027I have been blaming myself till I hardly knew what to do or where to turn, for the distress of mind I have caused her; and I\u0027ve come to the conclusion that I\u0027d better, if you\u0027ll stay with me, mum, the while, tell her the truth. You\u0027ll stay with me the while?\u0027 he inquired, trembling from head to foot. \u0027I don\u0027t know what effect it may have upon her; I don\u0027t know what she\u0027ll think of me; I don\u0027t know that she\u0027ll ever care for her poor father afterwards. But it\u0027s best for her that she should be undeceived, and I must bear the consequences as I deserve!\u0027 \u0027 Mary,\u0027 said Bertha, \u0027where is your hand! Ah! Here it is here it is!\u0027 pressing it to her lips, with a smile, and drawing it through her arm. \u0027I heard them speaking softly among themselves, last night, of some blame against you. They were wrong.\u0027 The Carrier\u0027s Wife was silent. Caleb answered for her. \u0027They were wrong,\u0027 he said. \u0027I knew it!\u0027 cried Bertha, proudly. \u0027I told them so. I scorned to hear a word! Blame HER with justice!\u0027 she pressed the hand between her own, and the soft cheek against her face. \u0027No! I am not so blind as that.\u0027 Her father went on one side of her, while Dot remained upon the other: holding her hand. \u0027I know you all,\u0027 said Bertha, \u0027better than you think. But none so well as her. Not even you, father. There is nothing half so real and so true about me, as she is. If I could be restored to sight this instant, and not a word were spoken, I could choose her from a crowd! My sister!\u0027 \u0027Bertha, my dear!\u0027 said Caleb, \u0027I have something on my mind I want to tell you, while we three are alone. Hear me kindly! I have a confession to make to you, my darling.\u0027 \u0027A confession, father?\u0027 \u0027I have wandered from the truth and lost myself, my child,\u0027 said Caleb, with a pitiable expression in his bewildered face. \u0027I have wandered from the truth, intending to be kind to you; and have been cruel.\u0027 She turned her wonder-stricken face towards him, and repeated \u0027Cruel!\u0027 69 \u0027He accuses himself too strongly, Bertha,\u0027 said Dot. \u0027You\u0027ll say so, presently. You\u0027ll be the first to tell him so.\u0027 \u0027He cruel to me!\u0027 cried Bertha, with a smile of incredulity. \u0027Not meaning it, my child,\u0027 said Caleb. \u0027But I have been; though I never suspected it, till yesterday. My dear blind daughter, hear me and forgive me! The world you live in, heart of mine, doesn\u0027t exist as I have represented it. The eyes you have trusted in, have been false to you.\u0027 She turned her wonder-stricken face towards him still; but drew back, and clung closer to her friend. \u0027Your road in life was rough, my poor one,\u0027 said Caleb, \u0027and I meant to smooth it for you. I have altered objects, changed the characters of people, invented many things that never have been, to make you happier. I have had concealments from you, put deceptions on you, God forgive me! and surrounded you with fancies.\u0027 \u0027But living people are not fancies!\u0027 she said hurriedly, and turning very pale, and still retiring from him. \u0027You can\u0027t change them.\u0027 \u0027I have done so, Bertha,\u0027 pleaded Caleb. \u0027There is one person that you know, my dove - \u0027 \u0027Oh father! why do you say, I know?\u0027 she answered, in a term of keen reproach. \u0027What and whom do I know! I who have no leader! I so miserably blind.\u0027 In the anguish of her heart, she stretched out her hands, as if she were groping her way; then spread them, in a manner most forlorn and sad, upon her face. \u0027The marriage that takes place to-day,\u0027 said Caleb, \u0027is with a stern, sordid, grinding man. A hard master to you and me, my dear, for many years. Ugly in his looks, and in his nature. Cold and callous always. Unlike what I have painted him to you in everything, my child. In everything.\u0027 \u0027Oh why,\u0027 cried the Blind Girl, tortured, as it seemed, almost beyond endurance, \u0027why did you ever do this! Why did you ever fill my heart so full, and then come in like Death, and tear away the objects of my love! O Heaven, how blind I am! How helpless and alone!\u0027 Her afflicted father hung his head, and offered no reply but in his 70 penitence and sorrow. She had been but a short time in this passion of regret, when the Cricket on the Hearth, unheard by all but her, began to chirp. Not merrily, but in a low, faint, sorrowing way. It was so mournful that her tears began to flow; and when the Presence which had been beside the Carrier all night, appeared behind her, pointing to her father, they fell down like rain. She heard the Cricket-voice more plainly soon, and was conscious, through her blindness, of the Presence hovering about her father. \u0027Mary,\u0027 said the Blind Girl, \u0027tell me what my home is. What it truly is.\u0027 \u0027It is a poor place, Bertha; very poor and bare indeed. The house will scarcely keep out wind and rain another winter. It is as roughly shielded from the weather, Bertha,\u0027 Dot continued in a low, clear voice, \u0027as your poor father in his sack-cloth coat.\u0027 The Blind Girl, greatly agitated, rose, and led the Carrier\u0027s little wife aside. \u0027Those presents that I took such care of; that came almost at my wish, and were so dearly welcome to me,\u0027 she said, trembling; \u0027where did they come from? Did you send them?\u0027 \u0027No.\u0027 \u0027Who then?\u0027 Dot saw she knew, already, and was silent. The Blind Girl spread her hands before her face again. But in quite another manner now. \u0027Dear Mary, a moment. One moment? More this way. Speak softly to me. You are true, I know. You\u0027d not deceive me now; would you?\u0027 \u0027No, Bertha, indeed!\u0027 \u0027No, I am sure you would not. You have too much pity for me. Mary, look across the room to where we were just now - to where my father is my father, so compassionate and loving to me - and tell me what you see.\u0027 \u0027I see,\u0027 said Dot, who understood her well, \u0027an old man sitting in a chair, and leaning sorrowfully on the back, with his face resting on his hand. As if his child should comfort him, Bertha.\u0027 71 \u0027Yes, yes. She will. Go on.\u0027 \u0027He is an old man, worn with care and work. He is a spare, dejected, thoughtful, grey-haired man. I see him now, despondent and bowed down, and striving against nothing. But, Bertha, I have seen him many times before, and striving hard in many ways for one great sacred object. And I honour his grey head, and bless him!\u0027 The Blind Girl broke away from her; and throwing herself upon her knees before him, took the grey head to her breast. \u0027It is my sight restored. It is my sight!\u0027 she cried. \u0027I have been blind, and now my eyes are open. I never knew him! To think I might have died, and never truly seen the father who has been so loving to me!\u0027 There were no words for Caleb\u0027s emotion. \u0027There is not a gallant figure on this earth,\u0027 exclaimed the Blind Girl, holding him in her embrace, \u0027that I would love so dearly, and would cherish so devotedly, as this! The greyer, and more worn, the dearer, father! Never let them say I am blind again. There\u0027s not a furrow in his face, there\u0027s not a hair upon his head, that shall be forgotten in my prayers and thanks to Heaven!\u0027 Caleb managed to articulate \u0027My Bertha!\u0027 \u0027And in my blindness, I believed him,\u0027 said the girl, caressing him with tears of exquisite affection, \u0027to be so different! And having him beside me, day by day, so mindful of me - always, never dreamed of this!\u0027 \u0027The fresh smart father in the blue coat, Bertha,\u0027 said poor Caleb. \u0027He\u0027s gone!\u0027 \u0027Nothing is gone,\u0027 she answered. \u0027Dearest father, no! Everything is here - in you. The father that I loved so well; the father that I never loved enough, and never knew; the benefactor whom I first began to reverence and love, because he had such sympathy for me; All are here in you. Nothing is dead to me. The soul of all that was most dear to me is here here, with the worn face, and the grey head. And I am NOT blind, father, any longer!\u0027 Dot\u0027s whole attention had been concentrated, during this discourse, upon the father and daughter; but looking, now, towards the little Haymaker in the Moorish meadow, she saw that the clock was within a 72 few minutes of striking, and fell, immediately, into a nervous and excited state. \u0027Father,\u0027 said Bertha, hesitating. \u0027Mary.\u0027 \u0027Yes, my dear,\u0027 returned Caleb. \u0027Here she is.\u0027 \u0027There is no change in HER. You never told me anything of HER that was not true?\u0027 \u0027I should have done it, my dear, I am afraid,\u0027 returned Caleb, \u0027if I could have made her better than she was. But I must have changed her for the worse, if I had changed her at all. Nothing could improve her, Bertha.\u0027 Confident as the Blind Girl had been when she asked the question, her delight and pride in the reply and her renewed embrace of Dot, were charming to behold. \u0027More changes than you think for, may happen though, my dear,\u0027 said Dot. \u0027Changes for the better, I mean; changes for great joy to some of us. You mustn\u0027t let them startle you too much, if any such should ever happen, and affect you? Are those wheels upon the road? You\u0027ve a quick ear, Bertha. Are they wheels?\u0027 \u0027Yes. Coming very fast.\u0027 \u0027I - I - I know you have a quick ear,\u0027 said Dot, placing her hand upon her heart, and evidently talking on, as fast as she could to hide its palpitating state, \u0027because I have noticed it often, and because you were so quick to find out that strange step last night. Though why you should have said, as I very well recollect you did say, Bertha, \"Whose step is that!\" and why you should have taken any greater observation of it than of any other step, I don\u0027t know. Though as I said just now, there are great changes in the world: great changes: and we can\u0027t do better than prepare ourselves to be surprised at hardly anything.\u0027 Caleb wondered what this meant; perceiving that she spoke to him, no less than to his daughter. He saw her, with astonishment, so fluttered and distressed that she could scarcely breathe; and holding to a chair, to save herself from falling. \u0027They are wheels indeed!\u0027 she panted. \u0027Coming nearer! Nearer! Very close! And now you hear them stopping at the garden-gate! And now you hear a step outside the door - the same step, Bertha, is it not! 73 and now!\u0027 She uttered a wild cry of uncontrollable delight; and running up to Caleb put her hands upon his eyes, as a young man rushed into the room, and flinging away his hat into the air, came sweeping down upon them. \u0027Is it over?\u0027 cried Dot. \u0027Yes!\u0027 \u0027Happily over?\u0027 \u0027Yes!\u0027 \u0027Do you recollect the voice, dear Caleb? Did you ever hear the like of it before?\u0027 cried Dot. \u0027If my boy in the Golden South Americas was alive\u0027 - said Caleb, trembling. \u0027He is alive!\u0027 shrieked Dot, removing her hands from his eyes, and clapping them in ecstasy; \u0027look at him! See where he stands before you, healthy and strong! Your own dear son! Your own dear living, loving brother, Bertha All honour to the little creature for her transports! All honour to her tears and laughter, when the three were locked in one another\u0027s arms! All honour to the heartiness with which she met the sunburnt sailor-fellow, with his dark streaming hair, half-way, and never turned her rosy little mouth aside, but suffered him to kiss it, freely, and to press her to his bounding heart! And honour to the Cuckoo too - why not! - for bursting out of the trapdoor in the Moorish Palace like a house-breaker, and hiccoughing twelve times on the assembled company, as if he had got drunk for joy! The Carrier, entering, started back. And well he might, to find himself in such good company. \u0027Look, John!\u0027 said Caleb, exultingly, \u0027look here! My own boy from the Golden South Americas! My own son! Him that you fitted out, and sent away yourself! Him that you were always such a friend to!\u0027 The Carrier advanced to seize him by the hand; but, recoiling, as some feature in his face awakened a remembrance of the Deaf Man in the Cart, said: \u0027Edward! Was it you?\u0027 74 \u0027Now tell him all!\u0027 cried Dot. \u0027Tell him all, Edward; and don\u0027t spare me, for nothing shall make me spare myself in his eyes, ever again.\u0027 \u0027I was the man,\u0027 said Edward. \u0027And could you steal, disguised, into the house of your old friend?\u0027 rejoined the Carrier. \u0027There was a frank boy once - how many years is it, Caleb, since we heard that he was dead, and had it proved, we thought? who never would have done that.\u0027 \u0027There was a generous friend of mine, once; more a father to me than a friend;\u0027 said Edward, \u0027who never would have judged me, or any other man, unheard. You were he. So I am certain you will hear me now.\u0027 The Carrier, with a troubled glance at Dot, who still kept far away from him, replied, \u0027Well! that\u0027s but fair. I will.\u0027 \u0027You must know that when I left here, a boy,\u0027 said Edward, \u0027I was in love, and my love was returned. She was a very young girl, who perhaps (you may tell me) didn\u0027t know her own mind. But I knew mine, and I had a passion for her.\u0027 \u0027You had!\u0027 exclaimed the Carrier. \u0027You!\u0027 \u0027Indeed I had,\u0027 returned the other. \u0027And she returned it. I have ever since believed she did, and now I am sure she did.\u0027 \u0027Heaven help me!\u0027 said the Carrier. \u0027This is worse than all.\u0027 \u0027Constant to her,\u0027 said Edward, \u0027and returning, full of hope, after many hardships and perils, to redeem my part of our old contract, I heard, twenty miles away, that she was false to me; that she had forgotten me; and had bestowed herself upon another and a richer man. I had no mind to reproach her; but I wished to see her, and to prove beyond dispute that this was true. I hoped she might have been forced into it, against her own desire and recollection. It would be small comfort, but it would be some, I thought, and on I came. That I might have the truth, the real truth; observing freely for myself, and judging for myself, without obstruction on the one hand, or presenting my own influence (if I had any) before her, on the other; I dressed myself unlike myself - you know how; and waited on the road - you know where. You had no suspicion of me; neither had had she,\u0027 pointing to Dot, \u0027until I whispered in her ear at that fireside, and she so nearly betrayed me.\u0027 75 \u0027But when she knew that Edward was alive, and had come back,\u0027 sobbed Dot, now speaking for herself, as she had burned to do, all through this narrative; \u0027and when she knew his purpose, she advised him by all means to keep his secret close; for his old friend John Peerybingle was much too open in his nature, and too clumsy in all artifice - being a clumsy man in general,\u0027 said Dot, half laughing and half crying - \u0027to keep it for him. And when she - that\u0027s me, John,\u0027 sobbed the little woman - \u0027told him all, and how his sweetheart had believed him to be dead; and how she had at last been over-persuaded by her mother into a marriage which the silly, dear old thing called advantageous; and when she - that\u0027s me again, John told him they were not yet married (though close upon it), and that it would be nothing but a sacrifice if it went on, for there was no love on her side; and when he went nearly mad with joy to hear it; then she - that\u0027s me again - said she would go between them, as she had often done before in old times, John, and would sound his sweetheart and be sure that what she -me again, John - said and thought was right. And it was right, John! And they were brought together, John! And they were married, John, an hour ago! And here\u0027s the Bride! And Gruff and Tackleton may die a bachelor! And I\u0027m a happy little woman, May, God bless you!\u0027 She was an irresistible little woman, if that be anything to the purpose; and never so completely irresistible as in her present transports. There never were congratulations so endearing and delicious, as those she lavished on herself and on the Bride. Amid the tumult of emotions in his breast, the honest Carrier had stood, confounded. Flying, now, towards her, Dot stretched out her hand to stop him, and retreated as before. \u0027No, John, no! Hear all! Don\u0027t love me any more, John, till you\u0027ve heard every word I have to say. It was wrong to have a secret from you, John. I\u0027m very sorry. I didn\u0027t think it any harm, till I came and sat down by you on the little stool last night. But when I knew by what was written in your face, that you had seen me walking in the gallery with Edward, and when I knew what you thought, I felt how giddy and how wrong it was. But oh, dear John, how could you, could you, think so!\u0027 Little woman, how she sobbed again! John Peerybingle would have 76 caught her in his arms. But no; she wouldn\u0027t let him. \u0027Don\u0027t love me yet, please, John! Not for a long time yet! When I was sad about this intended marriage, dear, it was because I remembered May and Edward such young lovers; and knew that her heart was far away from Tackleton. You believe that, now. Don\u0027t you, John?\u0027 John was going to make another rush at this appeal; but she stopped him again. \u0027No; keep there, please, John! When I laugh at you, as I sometimes do, John, and call you clumsy and a dear old goose, and names of that sort, it\u0027s because I love you, John, so well, and take such pleasure in your ways, and wouldn\u0027t see you altered in the least respect to have you made a King to-morrow.\u0027 \u0027Hooroar!\u0027 said Caleb with unusual vigour. \u0027My opinion!\u0027 \u0027And when I speak of people being middle-aged, and steady, John, and pretend that we are a humdrum couple, going on in a jog-trot sort of way, it\u0027s only because I\u0027m such a silly little thing, John, that I like, sometimes, to act a kind of Play with Baby, and all that: and make believe.\u0027 She saw that he was coming; and stopped him again. But she was very nearly too late. \u0027No, don\u0027t love me for another minute or two, if you please, John! What I want most to tell you, I have kept to the last. My dear, good, generous John, when we were talking the other night about the Cricket, I had it on my lips to say, that at first I did not love you quite so dearly as I do now; that when I first came home here, I was half afraid I mightn\u0027t learn to love you every bit as well as I hoped and prayed I might - being so very young, John! But, dear John, every day and hour I loved you more and more. And if I could have loved you better than I do, the noble words I heard you say this morning, would have made me. But I can\u0027t. All the affection that I had (it was a great deal, John) I gave you, as you well deserve, long, long ago, and I have no more left to give. Now, my dear husband, take me to your heart again! That\u0027s my home, John; and never, never think of sending me to any other!\u0027 You never will derive so much delight from seeing a glorious little woman in the arms of a third party, as you would have felt if you had seen 77 Dot run into the Carrier\u0027s embrace. It was the most complete, unmitigated, soul-fraught little piece of earnestness that ever you beheld in all your days. You maybe sure the Carrier was in a state of perfect rapture; and you may be sure Dot was likewise; and you may be sure they all were, inclusive of Miss Slowboy, who wept copiously for joy, and wishing to include her young charge in the general interchange of congratulations, handed round the Baby to everybody in succession, as if it were something to drink. But, now, the sound of wheels was heard again outside the door; and somebody exclaimed that Gruff and Tackleton was coming back. Speedily that worthy gentleman appeared, looking warm and flustered. \u0027Why, what the Devil\u0027s this, John Peerybingle!\u0027 said Tackleton. \u0027There\u0027s some mistake. I appointed Mrs. Tackleton to meet me at the church, and I\u0027ll swear I passed her on the road, on her way here. Oh! here she is! I beg your pardon, sir; I haven\u0027t the pleasure of knowing you; but if you can do me the favour to spare this young lady, she has rather a particular engagement this morning.\u0027 \u0027But I can\u0027t spare her,\u0027 returned Edward. \u0027I couldn\u0027t think of it.\u0027 \u0027What do you mean, you vagabond?\u0027 said Tackleton. \u0027I mean, that as I can make allowance for your being vexed,\u0027 returned the other, with a smile, \u0027I am as deaf to harsh discourse this morning, as I was to all discourse last night.\u0027 The look that Tackleton bestowed upon him, and the start he gave! \u0027I am sorry, sir,\u0027 said Edward, holding out May\u0027s left hand, and especially the third finger; \u0027that the young lady can\u0027t accompany you to church; but as she has been there once, this morning, perhaps you\u0027ll excuse her.\u0027 Tackleton looked hard at the third finger, and took a little piece of silver-paper, apparently containing a ring, from his waistcoat- pocket. \u0027Miss Slowboy,\u0027 said Tackleton. \u0027Will you have the kindness to throw that in the fire? Thank\u0027ee.\u0027 \u0027It was a previous engagement, quite an old engagement, that prevented my wife from keeping her appointment with you, I assure you,\u0027 78 said Edward. \u0027Mr. Tackleton will do me the justice to acknowledge that I revealed it to him faithfully; and that I told him, many times, I never could forget it,\u0027 said May, blushing. \u0027Oh certainly!\u0027 said Tackleton. \u0027Oh to be sure. Oh it\u0027s all right. It\u0027s quite correct. Mrs. Edward Plummer, I infer?\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s the name,\u0027 returned the bridegroom. \u0027Ah, I shouldn\u0027t have known you, sir,\u0027 said Tackleton, scrutinising his face narrowly, and making a low bow. \u0027I give you joy, sir!\u0027 \u0027Thank\u0027ee.\u0027 \u0027Mrs. Peerybingle,\u0027 said Tackleton, turning suddenly to where she stood with her husband; \u0027I am sorry. You haven\u0027t done me a very great kindness, but, upon my life I am sorry. You are better than I thought you. John Peerybingle, I am sorry. You understand me; that\u0027s enough. It\u0027s quite correct, ladies and gentlemen all, and perfectly satisfactory. Good morning!\u0027 With these words he carried it off, and carried himself off too: merely stopping at the door, to take the flowers and favours from his horse\u0027s head, and to kick that animal once, in the ribs, as a means of informing him that there was a screw loose in his arrangements. Of course it became a serious duty now, to make such a day of it, as should mark these events for a high Feast and Festival in the Peerybingle Calendar for evermore. Accordingly, Dot went to work to produce such an entertainment, as should reflect undying honour on the house and on every one concerned; and in a very short space of time, she was up to her dimpled elbows in flour, and whitening the Carrier\u0027s coat, every time he came near her, by stopping him to give him a kiss. That good fellow washed the greens, and peeled the turnips, and broke the plates, and upset iron pots full of cold water on the fire, and made himself useful in all sorts of ways: while a couple of professional assistants, hastily called in from somewhere in the neighbourhood, as on a point of life or death, ran against each other in all the doorways and round all the corners, and everybody tumbled over Tilly Slowboy and the Baby, everywhere. Tilly never came out in such force before. Her ubiquity was the theme of general 79 admiration. She was a stumbling-block in the passage at five-and-twenty minutes past two; a man-trap in the kitchen at half-past two precisely; and a pitfall in the garret at five-and-twenty minutes to three. The Baby\u0027s head was, as it were, a test and touchstone for every description of matter, - animal, vegetable, and mineral. Nothing was in use that day that didn\u0027t come, at some time or other, into close acquaintance with it. Then, there was a great Expedition set on foot to go and find out Mrs. Fielding; and to be dismally penitent to that excellent gentlewoman; and to bring her back, by force, if needful, to be happy and forgiving. And when the Expedition first discovered her, she would listen to no terms at all, but said, an unspeakable number of times, that ever she should have lived to see the day! and couldn\u0027t be got to say anything else, except, \u0027Now carry me to the grave:\u0027 which seemed absurd, on account of her not being dead, or anything at all like it. After a time, she lapsed into a state of dreadful calmness, and observed, that when that unfortunate train of circumstances had occurred in the Indigo Trade, she had foreseen that she would be exposed, during her whole life, to every species of insult and contumely; and that she was glad to find it was the case; and begged they wouldn\u0027t trouble themselves about her, - for what was she? oh, dear! a nobody! - but would forget that such a being lived, and would take their course in life without her. From this bitterly sarcastic mood, she passed into an angry one, in which she gave vent to the remarkable expression that the worm would turn if trodden on; and, after that, she yielded to a soft regret, and said, if they had only given her their confidence, what might she not have had it in her power to suggest! Taking advantage of this crisis in her feelings, the Expedition embraced her; and she very soon had her gloves on, and was on her way to John Peerybingle\u0027s in a state of unimpeachable gentility; with a paper parcel at her side containing a cap of state, almost as tall, and quite as stiff, as a mitre. Then, there were Dot\u0027s father and mother to come, in another little chaise; and they were behind their time; and fears were entertained; and there was much looking out for them down the road; and Mrs. Fielding always would look in the wrong and morally impossible direction; and being apprised thereof, hoped she might take the liberty of looking where 80 she pleased. At last they came: a chubby little couple, jogging along in a snug and comfortable little way that quite belonged to the Dot family; and Dot and her mother, side by side, were wonderful to see. They were so like each other. Then, Dot\u0027s mother had to renew her acquaintance with May\u0027s mother; and May\u0027s mother always stood on her gentility; and Dot\u0027s mother never stood on anything but her active little feet. And old Dot - so to call Dot\u0027s father, I forgot it wasn\u0027t his right name, but never mind - took liberties, and shook hands at first sight, and seemed to think a cap but so much starch and muslin, and didn\u0027t defer himself at all to the Indigo Trade, but said there was no help for it now; and, in Mrs. Fielding\u0027s summing up, was a good- natured kind of man - but coarse, my dear. I wouldn\u0027t have missed Dot, doing the honours in her wedding-gown, my benison on her bright face! for any money. No! nor the good Carrier, so jovial and so ruddy, at the bottom of the table. Nor the brown, fresh sailor-fellow, and his handsome wife. Nor any one among them. To have missed the dinner would have been to miss as jolly and as stout a meal as man need eat; and to have missed the overflowing cups in which they drank The Wedding-Day, would have been the greatest miss of all. After dinner, Caleb sang the song about the Sparkling Bowl. As I\u0027m a living man, hoping to keep so, for a year or two, he sang it through. And, by-the-by, a most unlooked-for incident occurred, just as he finished the last verse. There was a tap at the door; and a man came staggering in, without saying with your leave, or by your leave, with something heavy on his head. Setting this down in the middle of the table, symmetrically in the centre of the nuts and apples, he said: \u0027Mr. Tackleton\u0027s compliments, and as he hasn\u0027t got no use for the cake himself, p\u0027raps you\u0027ll eat it.\u0027 And with those words, he walked off. There was some surprise among the company, as you may imagine. Mrs. Fielding, being a lady of infinite discernment, suggested that the cake was poisoned, and related a narrative of a cake, which, within her knowledge, had turned a seminary for young ladies, blue. But she was 81 overruled by acclamation; and the cake was cut by May, with much ceremony and rejoicing. I don\u0027t think any one had tasted it, when there came another tap at the door, and the same man appeared again, having under his arm a vast brown-paper parcel. \u0027Mr. Tackleton\u0027s compliments, and he\u0027s sent a few toys for the Babby. They ain\u0027t ugly.\u0027 After the delivery of which expressions, he retired again. The whole party would have experienced great difficulty in finding words for their astonishment, even if they had had ample time to seek them. But they had none at all; for the messenger had scarcely shut the door behind him, when there came another tap, and Tackleton himself walked in. \u0027Mrs. Peerybingle!\u0027 said the Toy-merchant, hat in hand. \u0027I\u0027m sorry. I\u0027m more sorry than I was this morning. I have had time to think of it. John Peerybingle! I\u0027m sour by disposition; but I can\u0027t help being sweetened, more or less, by coming face to face with such a man as you. Caleb! This unconscious little nurse gave me a broken hint last night, of which I have found the thread. I blush to think how easily I might have bound you and your daughter to me, and what a miserable idiot I was, when I took her for one! Friends, one and all, my house is very lonely tonight. I have not so much as a Cricket on my Hearth. I have scared them all away. Be gracious to me; let me join this happy party!\u0027 He was at home in five minutes. You never saw such a fellow. What HAD he been doing with himself all his life, never to have known, before, his great capacity of being jovial! Or what had the Fairies been doing with him, to have effected such a change! \u0027John! you won\u0027t send me home this evening; will you?\u0027 whispered Dot. He had been very near it though! There wanted but one living creature to make the party complete; and, in the twinkling of an eye, there he was, very thirsty with hard running, and engaged in hopeless endeavours to squeeze his head into a narrow pitcher. He had gone with the cart to its journey\u0027s end, very much 82 disgusted with the absence of his master, and stupendously rebellious to the Deputy. After lingering about the stable for some little time, vainly attempting to incite the old horse to the mutinous act of returning on his own account, he had walked into the tap-room and laid himself down before the fire. But suddenly yielding to the conviction that the Deputy was a humbug, and must be abandoned, he had got up again, turned tail, and come home. There was a dance in the evening. With which general mention of that recreation, I should have left it alone, if I had not some reason to suppose that it was quite an original dance, and one of a most uncommon figure. It was formed in an odd way; in this way. Edward, that sailor-fellow - a good free dashing sort of a fellow he was -had been telling them various marvels concerning parrots, and mines, and Mexicans, and gold dust, when all at once he took it in his head to jump up from his seat and propose a dance; for Bertha\u0027s harp was there, and she had such a hand upon it as you seldom hear. Dot (sly little piece of affectation when she chose) said her dancing days were over; I think because the Carrier was smoking his pipe, and she liked sitting by him, best. Mrs. Fielding had no choice, of course, but to say HER dancing days were over, after that; and everybody said the same, except May; May was ready. So, May and Edward got up, amid great applause, to dance alone; and Bertha plays her liveliest tune. Well! if you\u0027ll believe me, they have not been dancing five minutes, when suddenly the Carrier flings his pipe away, takes Dot round the waist, dashes out into the room, and starts off with her, toe and heel, quite wonderfully. Tackleton no sooner sees this, than he skims across to Mrs. Fielding, takes her round the waist, and follows suit. Old Dot no sooner sees this, than up he is, all alive, whisks off Mrs. Dot in the middle of the dance, and is the foremost there. Caleb no sooner sees this, than he clutches Tilly Slowboy by both hands and goes off at score; Miss Slowboy, firm in the belief that diving hotly in among the other couples, and effecting any number of concussions with them, is your only principle of footing it. 83 Hark! how the Cricket joins the music with its Chirp, Chirp, Chirp; and how the kettle hums! * * * * * But what is this! Even as I listen to them, blithely, and turn towards Dot, for one last glimpse of a little figure very pleasant to me, she and the rest have vanished into air, and I am left alone. A Cricket sings upon the Hearth; a broken child\u0027s-toy lies upon the ground; and nothing else remains. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3325/91048.html","bookId":256,"book":{"id":256,"title":"The Cricket on the Hearth","description":"简介： 货运工约翰的妻子、善良的主妇多特相信，壁炉边的蟋蟀是捍卫自家家宅的小小神灵。这是一桩不被看好的婚姻，靠运货为生的约翰比多特要年长许多，他粗壮笨拙，多特则娇小可爱，朋友们围绕在多特身边，大家虽皆不富足，却因为拥有多特这样特殊的朋友，在团聚时充满欢声笑语...","cover":"http://novel.tingroom.com/file/upload/201907/29/09-53-10-19-1.jpg","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3325","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:28 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:28 AM"}}
