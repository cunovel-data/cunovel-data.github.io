{"id":100616,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"\"So, what do you recommend as the sights to see around Blansko?\"\n \"Oh, there are many magnificent tourist sights,\" the tall man sitting across from us answered, pushing his glasses higher up on his nose. \"There are the karst, of course: Catherine Cave, Sloupsko-Sosuvske Cave, and Balcarka Cave are some of the better-known examples. And the Macocha Abyss is not to be missed; it is 138 meters deep, you know.\"\n I didn\u0027t know, as a matter of fact, which was why, when I found an English-speaking ex-Czech national on the train heading north of Brno returning to his homeland for a brother\u0027s wedding, I pumped him for information on the area.\n Roxy looked up from one of the Book of Secrets novels that I had secretly reread before the trip - secretly because I didn\u0027t want Roxy thinking I was reading it less as fiction and more as a guidebook to the area, as she was. \"An abyss? There\u0027s an abyss? Is it dark and mysterious and bottomless? Are there things lurking in its hidden depths, things that no man has lived to tell about?\"\n \"Ignore her,\" I told the man and his companion. \"She refuses to read guidebooks, preferring to be surprised instead.\" I pulled out my own guidebook and flipped through it until I found the item mentioned.\n \"The Macocha Abyss is a famous geological formation,\" I told Roxy, \"and the picture shows it\u0027s not in the least bit dark or mysterious. There\u0027s a trail you can take to walk down into it, to the Punkevn¨ª cave.\"\n \"Oh,\" she said, clearly disappointed. She glanced out the window at the scenery - heavily forested land, rising in elevation as we headed into the Moravian Highlands and the small town of Blansko. I knew from my glance at the map that Drahansk¨¢ Castle, cuddled up close to Blansko, sat hidden in the forests of the eastern edge of Bohemia.\n \"Caves sound cool, but what is that other thing you mentioned?\" I asked. The man looked confused by my question.\n \"I think she\u0027s asking what a karst is, Martin.\"\n I nodded to Martin\u0027s wife, a lively blond American named Holly. \"On the nose. I haven\u0027t a clue what a karst is.\"\n \"Ah,\" Martin answered, smiling and rubbing his hands. It turned out I was asking the right man, since Martin was a geophysical expert who told me more than I ever wanted to know about the canyons, gorges, and more than four hundred large and small caves that honeycombed the surrounding area. Even Roxy pulled her nose out of her book and paid attention once he described some of the more spectacular caves, ones that had underground rivers running through them. I rustled through my guidebook looking for information on the ones that were open to the public.\n \"Sounds cool.\" I smiled, trying to cut off the flow of information about the biochemical makeup of the limestone and the effect it had on the surrounding water table.\n \"What about the castle?\" Roxy wanted to know.\n \"Oh, yes, the castle. Drahansk¨¢ is the name. Very impressive, but not open to the public as it\u0027s privately owned, but the grounds are very fine and open year round. You should visit them; the sculptures were by Schweigl.\"\n I made an impressed. \"No! Not Schweigl himself!\" face, and nodded, hoping our source of unbounded information wouldn\u0027t go into detail on the chemical composition of the soil in the Schweigl-decorated gardens.\n \"The castle itself is limestone, of course.\"\n \"Of course,\" I agreed, and hurried another question forward before Martin continued that particular thread of conversation. \"My friend is interested in some of the folklore which I understand is particularly rich in this area.\"\n \"Yes, it is,\" Holly answered for Martin. \"Very rich. Moravia was a separate state for centuries, you know, and they have a fascinating history. Much of their folklore has been carved from the dark roots of their past.\"\n She must have noticed the look Roxy and I slid each other because she gave a little laugh and explained, \"I have a degree in Eastern European history. That\u0027s how I met Martin - I was studying at Ostrava University when he was finishing up his metallurgical degree. This area is a veritable hotbed of folklore, everything from heroic tales of knights to more traditional examples of what we think of as a standard fairy tale involving princesses and enchantments.\"\n \"Fascinating,\" Roxy said, leaning forward. \"Tell us more. These dark roots you mention sound thrilling - you mean like horror tales? Burning witches and all that?\"\n \"Oh no, much darker than that,\" laughed Holly. \"Supposedly - this is just folklore, mind you - this area is second only to Transylvania for its population of supernatural beings. Vampires and necromancers, secret societies practicing blood sacrifices, shape-shifters, cursed families, centuries-old feuds between families with seemingly unholy powers - that sort of thing.\"\n \"Foolishness,\" snorted Martin, pulling out a Prague newspaper. \"I grew up not more than thirty kilometers from this area, and those stories were only used to keep small children from wandering the forests alone at night.\"\n \"Yes, of course, foolishness.\" I smiled brightly, pinching Roxy on the wrist to keep her from disputing the statement. She glared at me and angrily rubbed her arm, but didn\u0027t say anything more when I turned the conversation to less interesting topics.\n An hour later we arrived at our destination, the \"bustling market town of Blansko\" as the guidebook called it. I looked up from the book and peered around me.\n \"Not much bustle,\" Roxy commented sourly, slinging the strap of one bag over her shoulder while grabbing the two other pieces. \"More like a limp, if you ask me. There\u0027s not even a porter or someone to bribe into carrying our bags. What sort of place is this?\"\n \"Exactly what you wanted, missy, so stop your whining. If you hadn\u0027t insisted on bringing three bags, you wouldn\u0027t need anyone to carry your stuff.\"\n Luckily for my peace of mind, there was a taxi in the small town, but it was off running someone else to their destination. I chatted with the stationmaster in my high school German for a few minutes, then went over to where Roxy sat camped out on her mound of luggage next to the taxi stop. She got up and wandered over to the station wall to read all the bills posted announcing local bands playing taverns, housecleaning services, tour times to the various caves, et cetera.\n \"Hans the stationmeister says the taxi guy should be back in fifteen minutes, so if we sit tight, we won\u0027t have to haul all your luggage up that hill. Brrr, kind of cold out here, isn\u0027t - \"\n \"OHMIGOD, Joy, c\u0027mere!\"\n \"What?\"\n She jumped up and down in place, her breath puffing white in front of her as she beckoned me over to a spot on the wall. \"You\u0027re not going to believe this! Look! Just look! Just stand right there in front of me and read that, and tell me that Miranda didn\u0027t foresee this!\"\n \"What?\" I asked again, warily this time as I approached a large black and red poster. \"It doesn\u0027t have anything to do with axe-murdering maniacs, does it?\"\n \"Stop being such a poop and read it! Oh, what a glorious, glorious time we\u0027re going to have!\" She hugged herself with happiness, and whirled around until the fringe on her jacket spun out.\n \"I knew it, I knew it,\" she chanted to herself. I looked around quickly, hoping no one could see us in the gathering darkness of the late afternoon. I was ready to disavow her if she was going to stand in a foreign country and act like an idiot.\n \"Read it!\" she demanded, pointing a finger at the poster.\n \"Stop acting like a boob, and I might.\"\n \"Read it!\"\n I read it. The sign was printed in English, German, and French, GOTHFAIRE! it proclaimed in bold, red letters: TAKE A JOURNEY TO THE DARKNESS THAT DWELLS WITHIN US ALL, EXPERIENCE DARK PASSIONS AND DARKER SINS. INDULGE IN YOUR DEEPEST, MOST SECRET GOTHIC DESIRES AS YOU PLUNGE INTO A WORLD FILLED WITH THE MACABRE, THE BIZARRE, THE ENDLESS NIGHT. TICKETS available beginning 24 October. \"Sounds like a carnival or something like one of those Renaissance fairs, only this one is devoted to the Goth scene. What about it? You don\u0027t plan on going to it, do you?\"\n \"Look at the bottom,\" Roxy chanted, dancing a grapevine dance past the luggage. \"Look at the bottom, look at the bottom.\"\n \"You need serious medication,\" I muttered before bending over almost double and squinting at the tiny red print.\n GOTHFAIRE IS PROUD TO SPONSOR THE ALL HALLOW\u0027S EVE FESTIVAL OF THE DARK, 31 OCTOBER AT DRAHANSKA CASTLE, BLANSKO, CZECH REPUBLIC. TICKETS TO THE FESTIVAL WILL BE AVAILABLE AFTER...\n \"Oh, Lord.\" Just what I needed, a big party celebrating a fictional cult of vampires. It wasn\u0027t bad enough that Roxy had planned for us to spend every evening scouring the area for any possible Dark Ones who might be roaming the streets in search of prey; no, now she would drag me to a week-long fair and festival with a bunch of pimply teens who were heavily into the Goth scene. \"No, no, no,\" I groaned.\n \"Yes, yes, yes,\" Roxy sang as she danced by me. \"You see? Now do you believe in Miranda\u0027s powers? She said you\u0027d meet a Dark One, and just look! There will be a whole fair full of them! Not to mention the ones we\u0027ll find at the Festival!\"\n \"Oh, for heaven\u0027s sake, Rox, there are no such things as vampires!\"\n My words fell on deaf ears, but before I could shake some sense into her, a small, beat-up blue Peugeot that looked like it had been through a couple of wars squealed to a halt beside us. I grabbed Roxy and shoved her toward the car. \"Taxi\u0027s here. Grab your luggage while I tell the driver what hotel we\u0027re staying at. And for God\u0027s sake, stop dancing! You want everyone to think Americans are lunatics?\"\n The Hotel Dukla wasn\u0027t really that far from the train station, but it was up a steep hill, and off the main square on the edge of the town. Within half an hour of arriving in Blansko, we had checked in, hauled our luggage up the three flights of twisting, uneven stairs to the loft rooms assigned us, and quickly changed out of wrinkled travel clothes to something a little more decorous. Roxy beat me to the communal bathroom, so I had to wait until she was finished before I could wash up.\n \"See you in the bar,\" she called out to me a few minutes later as she skipped down the stairs. I grimaced at the careless way she raced down, hoping she wouldn\u0027t break her neck on the steps\u0027 uneven tread, and set about making myself presentable to the local populace. I had this Audrey Hepburn image in my head of how I wanted to appear: sophisticated, elegant, and unmussed. I carefully unpacked my long black velvet dress that made me look thinner, pinned up my plain brown hair that a stylist once kindly referred to as chestnut, and dabbed on a little perfume.\n \"You\u0027re a long way from Audrey Hepburn.\" I wrinkled my nose at the reflection in the tiny mirror over an oak bureau. \"But you\u0027ll do.\"\n I don\u0027t quite know whom I had pictured as the patrons in the hotel\u0027s bar, the most popular in the city according to the proud hotel owner, but the sight that met my eyes was not it. I imagined people in tweed hats and dirndls and such, but what I saw was a room with a low ceiling made of dark, smoky beams crossing in a herringbone pattern. The few people already in the bar were for the most part in jeans and sweaters, and there was nary a dirndl to be seen. At the opposite end of the room, two large windows ran ceiling to floor, overlooking a balcony that opened to a grassy meadow that brushed up against the darker purple rise of the Moravian mountains. Peeking through the dark trees, I could see a part of a turret of Drahansk¨¢ Castle. The sky above it was deepening into an indigo that matched the soft lines of the mountains nestled against the town. There was something about the rich shades of blues, blacks, and purples that struck a chord deep within me, but before I could wander over to the window to look out at the scenery, I was hallooed.\n Roxy called out from a long table that hugged one of the side walls. She sat in the middle of the table with two women on either side of her. At least I guessed they were women; they could have been men in drag. It was hard to tell, what with the layers of pancake and kohl and the crimson lipstick that slashed their mouths into hard, unbending lines. They were dressed similarly, both in black vinyl lace-up bodices over red chiffon blouses. Although their lower halves were hidden by the thick polished plank that served as a table, I assumed they also had spiky, high-heeled black leather boots, and probably micro miniskirts with the visible garter belts that so many young women thought looked sexy.\n \"Damn. She\u0027s found herself some Goths,\" I swore to myself, looking around the room for an escape. There was none, so I slapped a pleasant smile on my face and wound my way through the chairs and tables to where Roxy was waving vigorously at me.\n \"There you are. I thought you\u0027d never get here. Joy, this is Arielle and Tanya. They\u0027re both witches.\"\n My smile frayed a bit around the edges as I held out my hand to Tanya, sitting nearest me. She examined my hand as if it might have leprosy, then gave me a sour look and dismissed me as unworthy of her time. Goths - the poseurs of the underworld. Where would we be without them?\n \"Actually, I\u0027m apprenticed to Tanya,\" the woman named Arielle said as she stood up and leaned over the table to shake my hand. She had a faint Slavic accent mixed in with heavy French. Her friendly washed-out blue eyes were a nice counterpoint to her friend\u0027s hostile glare. \"I\u0027m not a witch yet, but I hope to be as powerful as my sister in a few years.\"\n \"Your sister?\" I asked, pulling out a chair across from Roxy.\n \"They\u0027re sisters,\" Roxy said helpfully, smiling at Tanya. She ignored both of us, her eyes darting around the room, glancing frequently between the long windows and the door opposite. \"I got you a beer. I hope you don\u0027t mind if it\u0027s dark. That\u0027s all they seem to drink here.\"\n Roxy pushed a huge mug toward me. I figured the Czechs must have bladders of iron if they were able to drink that much on a regular basis.\n \"You\u0027ll never guess where Tanya and Arielle work! The GothFaire! Isn\u0027t that great? Arielle says they have all sort of attractions like palm readers, and tarot card readers and a medium, a magician, and lots and lots of vampires.\"\n I choked on the tentative sip I was taking of the dark brown beer, just barely keeping it from taking the passage north to my nose.\n \"I beg your pardon?\" I asked, licking the foam from my upper lip.\n \"Vampires,\" Roxy said happily. \"Loads of them. Isn\u0027t that thrilling?\"\n \"Loads of them,\" I repeated, looking from Roxy to Tanya to Arielle. \"How many is loads?\"\n Although I was curious about the so-called vampires connected with the fair, I wasn\u0027t entirely surprised to hear they were present. I had a friend who had flirted briefly with the Goth society in San Francisco, and she told me that vampirism, in its pretense form, was very popular amongst the set. Some of them really got into the image, with cosmetically enhanced canine teeth, drinking animal blood obtained from slaughterhouses (something that was more common than I cared to think about), and living, in general, the vampire life without actually being undead.\n \"Dominic and Milos, the owners of GothFaire, are Vampyr,\" Tanya answered in a husky, heavily accented voice. She pronounced the word vampire in the affected, artsy-fartsy way that never failed to make my teeth itch.\n \"Are they? How very interesting,\" I said brightly. \"And how enterprising of them to own a business. I wouldn\u0027t imagine vampires had much need for money, but I suppose the price of capes and dental care has gone up.\"\n Tanya\u0027s kohl-laden eyelids lifted to pierce me with a gaze that would have had more impact on me if her pupils hadn\u0027t been dilated. Drugs, no doubt, I thought to myself. I\u0027d heard that hallucinogenic drugs were particularly popular with the Goth groups, since they were felt to enhance the user\u0027s abilities to have visions. Duh, said I.\n \"There\u0027s almost twenty of us with the Faire,\" Arielle said quickly. \"We travel all over Europe, and Dominic pays us a share of the profits, keeping none for himself or Milos.\"\n \"Ah,\" I nodded, willing to let the subject go. I was conscious of a slight feeling of edginess, which I put down to being in a strange country with some extremely strange people. I glanced out the window again, my eyes drawn to the line of ebony mountain silhouetted against the now dark sky. Something didn\u0027t feel right, but I couldn\u0027t decide what it was. After being in Frankfurt for a week, both Roxy and I had adjusted to the time difference, so that wasn\u0027t the problem...\n Roxy glanced at her watch and asked Arielle when the fair opened.\n \"One hour after sunset,\" she said with a shy little smile. She really was cute; it was just too bad that someone had talked her into dying her hair a flat, dull black, and slathering on way too much makeup. I pegged her at about seventeen, and hoped this was an experimental phase she would grow out of quickly.\n \"Good. We\u0027ll go just as soon as we\u0027ve had dinner, right, Joyful?\"\n My sense of unease grew. I glanced again at the mountains. What was it they were trying to tell me? \"Hmm? Sure, if you like. We can take in the sights. Have our palms read, and watch the magic show, and stake a vampire or two through the heart.\"\n \"Joy!\"\n Tanya\u0027s eyes snapped open at my words, her nostrils flaring in a manner that reminded me of a horse, an observation I wisely kept to myself. Her fingernails were long, sharply pointed, and painted black. It was entirely possible she\u0027d dipped the tips in poison.\n \"Sorry.\" I offered a cheesy smile as a token of friendship. Tanya dismissed it with an impatient snort. Once again her gaze shot to the door.\n I decided to offer my olive branch to Arielle. \"So, are you guys only here for a drink before the show opens, or would you like to have dinner with us? The owner said the pub grub was supposed to be pretty good.\"\n \"Pub grub?\" Arielle looked confused.\n \"The food they serve here in the bar,\" Roxy said soothingly, shooting me an admonishing glance. \"You\u0027re welcome to join us; we\u0027d love to find out all about the fair and what you do there, and of course, what it\u0027s like to work with two vampires. I mean, Vampyrs.\"\n I rolled my eyes.\n \"We\u0027ve already had supper,\" Arielle said quickly, darting a nervous glance to her sister. \"We\u0027re just here waiting for the men. We always gather in a public location before we open the fair. Dominic says it impresses people and makes them curious about the fair.\"\n \"I imagine it also serves as sort of a cattle call, too.\" At Arielle\u0027s blank look, I elaborated. \"You know, it lets them look over the available stock of blood donors. Heh heh heh.\"\n She shot another look at Tanya, and gave me a worried little feeble laugh. Roxy paused in smiling at her long enough to shoot me a warning look that I ignored. She chatted happily with Arielle about the sights at the fair, what her role was (she read tarot cards), and how she enjoyed traveling all over Europe, all the while I sat and fidgeted. The uncomfortable feeling of something portentous heading my way was growing steadily stronger. I had a momentary image in my mind of a shadow stalking through the woods, the scent of pine so strong it almost tickled my nose. I blinked the sensation aside and rubbed the back of my neck as I tried to focus my attention on what Arielle was saying.\n \"... was very nice, but just after we arrived there, someone was horribly murdered in the adjacent town, and the Heidelberg police closed all the roads for a day, so we were late for a show in Aufsdajm.\"\n \"Oooh, a murder,\" Roxy cooed. \"How thrilling. Did the police grill you?\"\n A wave of foreboding crashed over me, almost making me gasp with the intensity of it. I looked around the room, trying to decide if it was someone staring at me that was having the affect on me, but no one was looking our way. Maybe I was just tired from a day spent on the train.\n \"Grill? They wanted to know if we\u0027d seen the woman who was killed.\" Arielle\u0027s voice trailed away as she fretted with the stem of her glass of beer.\n \"And had you?\" Roxy asked, ever curious.\n Arielle swallowed hard, her gaze glued on the tabletop. \"Yes, I had. She came to the fair a few days before. I read the cards for her.\"\n \"A great many people came to the fair that week, Arielle,\" Tanya snapped. \"I have told you before that you have nothing to feel guilty about.\"\n \"But I didn\u0027t see the danger,\" Arielle all but wailed, her pale blue eyes swimming with sudden tears. \"I did not see it. I saw nothing. I let her go without warning her at all!\"\n Tanya leaned forward across Roxy, who plastered herself against the high back of the wooden chair in an attempt to get out of the way. \"You... did... nothing... wrong.\" The words came out hard and short, distracting me for a moment from the gathering blackness I could feel approaching.\n \"I know you say that, but I should have seen, I should have known... \" Arielle grabbed for her napkin and wiped at the tears spilling from her eyes.\n Tanya spat something out in a language I didn\u0027t understand. Whatever it was, it was effective. Arielle nodded, mumbling an apology to us while she mopped up. Roxy went immediately into comfort mode, putting her arm around the young woman and patting her shoulder.\n \"It\u0027s not every day you meet someone who\u0027s read tarot cards for a murder victim,\" I commented chattily, receiving for my efforts identical glares from both Roxy and Tanya.\n \"It wasn\u0027t just the one,\" Arielle said, blowing her nose delicately. \"There was another woman murdered in Le Havre just after we left, and one in Bordeaux three months ago - do you remember, Tanya? She bought a love spell from you the week before. We saw her picture in the paper. She was the latest victim, until Heidelberg.\"\n The room spun into a gray swirl of confusion as the image of a man burst with startling clarity into my mind. He was in black, his features shadowed, silhouetted against the night, walking with long, tireless strides. The wind brushed against him as he moved through the woods, driven by a need I couldn\u0027t begin to understand. I was pulled toward him, merged with him until I could feel the blood moving through his veins and the breath on his lips as he approached the town, stalking through the night with an arrogance that bespoke centuries of existence. Through his eyes I saw the lights of the town as they flickered through the pine boughs; when his breath quickened as he inhaled deeply to catch the scents of the town, so did mine. The images in his mind filled mine, thoughts of humans, warm and alive, their blood singing a sweet siren song he couldn\u0027t resist. He leaped over a drainage ditch, moving swiftly and powerfully up a hill to the outskirts of town, muscles and sinews and tendons working with graceful efficiency. The scent of blood was strong in our nostrils now; the taste of it made our mouths water. I knew from our memory that the feel of it was like nothing I\u0027d ever known, hot and sweet, flowing down my throat -\n \"JOY!\"\n I jumped as the horrible sensations faded, leaving me nauseated and shaking, clutching the table as the room dipped and spun around me. It was like the experience I\u0027d had a few weeks prior at Miranda\u0027s, but a hundred times more intense, a thousand times more terrible. I hadn\u0027t just seen a man this time, I\u0027d merged with him, become part of him, joined with him as he stalked his prey. My mind was screaming out demands for information and warnings with equal confusion, and yet in all the chaos, one question repeated itself again and again until it consumed me.\n What the hell was happening to me? \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-girl-s-guide-to-vampires-dark-ones-1/page-3.html","bookId":2190,"book":{"id":2190,"title":"A Girl\u0027s Guide to Vampires (Dark Ones #1)","description":"Storyline: \n A Girl\u0027s Guide to Vampires (Dark Ones #1) \n All Joy Randall wants is a little old-fashioned romance, but when she participates in a \"Goddess evoking\" ceremony with her friend, Roxy, Joy finds out her future true love is a man with the potential to put her immortal soul in danger.
