{"id":100628,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"\"So, Superman, it\u0027s been a half hour. Have you recovered enough to talk now?\"\\n\\n Raphael, lying on his belly, lifted his head just enough to press a tender, but sated, kiss to my ankle. \"I may never recover, but if you don\u0027t require anything more strenuous than me moving my mouth, I will strive to satisfy you.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, Bob,\" I crooned, wiggling my toes and reaching over to tickle his feet, \"there is no question about my satisfaction. I\u0027m probably the most satisfied woman in the world. I certainly should be after the heroic effort you made to curl my hair.\"\\n\\n He rolled over onto his side, a smug smile gracing his adorable lips as he teased a finger along the line of my pubic bone. \"Looks like I succeeded.\"\\n\\n I bit his ankle.\\n\\n He sighed and rolled onto his back, taking one of my legs with him, idly stroking my calf as he spoke. \"I assume you want to discuss the murder.\"\\n\\n \"Amongst other things,\" I said, thinking of Christian. \"You... um... did talk to the police, didn\u0027t you? I mean, really talk to them?\"\\n\\n \"I did.\" He didn\u0027t look too upset by the experience, so they must not have questioned him about anything but the murders. I breathed a sigh of relief.\\n\\n \"What, if anything, did the police say to you when they questioned you? They wouldn\u0027t answer any of my questions, they just kept telling me to explain again why I was in those trees rather than taking the shorter way to the hotel.\"\\n\\n Raphael swirled little circles on my leg. \"What makes you think they told me anything?\"\\n\\n I sat up and looked at him. \"You\u0027re a man. Men like the police always feel it\u0027s important to keep women out of the loop. They disguise it as a protection tactic, but really they just want something to feel superior about. So, what did they say to you?\"\\n\\n His lovely amber eyes considered me silently for a long minute; then he, too, sat up. \"Joy, that\u0027s something I can\u0027t tell you.\"\\n\\n \"What? Why? Because of this secret in your past that you refuse to tell me?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, it has to do with that. I would tell you if I could, but I can\u0027t.\"\\n\\n I didn\u0027t like the serious mien to his face. I slid my hand up his leg. \"What do you mean, you can\u0027t tell me? You can\u0027t tell me because the police asked you not to, or you can\u0027t tell me because you don\u0027t trust me?\"\\n\\n He watched my hand as it traced the long bulge of muscle from his knee to his hip. \"It\u0027s not a matter of trusting you. There\u0027s a lot more at stake than just your feelings. The police are conducting a detailed investigation, and I can\u0027t... I... ah, Christ. I wish things were different. I wish I could just... \"\\n\\n He left the sentence unfinished, but I had no trouble filling it in. He had a secret, and he couldn\u0027t trust me with it.\\n\\n I thought again of the scene I had witnessed: Raphael bending over Tanya\u0027s body. Could I have been wrong about him? Hadn\u0027t he discovered Tanya accidentally as I had? And what was he doing out there rather than staying at the fair, where he was needed? Did he have a reason to want Tanya dead?\\n\\n I shook the thought away as soon as it formed. I might not have known Raphael long, but I knew I trusted him. He was not a killer. \"Why weren\u0027t you at the fair?\"\\n\\n His eyes narrowed.\\n\\n \"It was only eleven. You should have been watching over the crowds as the bands changed. Why weren\u0027t you there?\"\\n\\n A muscle in his jaw twitched.\\n\\n \"OK, let\u0027s try this question on for size. What hold does Dominic have over you? What does he know about your last job that keeps you, a man who is well educated and intelligent, working an inferior job at a moderately successful little traveling fair? Why aren\u0027t you some high-powered mucky-muck at an international corporation?\"\\n\\n \"Joy - \"\\n\\n He had no intention of answering me, that was plain. I didn\u0027t matter enough to him; he didn\u0027t trust me because I was nothing but an unimportant floozy who threw herself into his bed. A holiday fling, Roxy had called it. Tears started pricking behind my eyeballs.\\n\\n \"No good? Well, how about this: What did you pick up when you were bending over Tanya\u0027s body?\"\\n\\n Raphael looked shocked by what I said. \"You saw me pick something up?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"Yes. Just before you went to the hotel, you picked something up from the ground near Tanya. What was it, one of her wax voodoo dolls?\"\\n\\n He looked at me as if I were a stranger. \"You were spying on me? Following me?\"\\n\\n Maybe I was a stranger. Maybe I didn\u0027t know him at all.\\n\\n Maybe I had made the worst mistake of my life. I shook my head. \"No, I wasn\u0027t following you and I wasn\u0027t spying on you. And to tell you the truth\" - I brushed away a tear that rolled down my cheek - \"I\u0027m more than a little insulted that you\u0027d think I would.\"\\n\\n Slowly he got out of bed and grabbed his pants from where they dangled from the doorknob. \"How did you know I took something from Tanya?\"\\n\\n Oh, God, how could things be so good one moment and so bad the next? I pulled the sheet up until it covered my now chilled flesh. \"I saw you. I wasn\u0027t spying on you, I was just taking the long way to the hotel because a bunch of kids were drunk on the east side of the meadow, and I didn\u0027t want to walk through them alone. I just saw you, that\u0027s all. You were acting funny, so I just watched to see what it was you were doing. And now, if you\u0027re finished with the third degree, I think I want to go back to my hotel. I have the feeling that I\u0027m not terribly welcome here anymore.\"\\n\\n He reached a hand into his pants pocket and pulled out a purple stone. I stared at it, a chill skimming my spine. \"It\u0027s a rune.\"\\n\\n He nodded.\\n\\n \"An amethyst rune.\"\\n\\n He said nothing.\\n\\n \"Just like mine.\"\\n\\n His eyes glittered with dark emotion.\\n\\n \"You found it on her body?\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" he said, the word stark and bare in the warmth of his bedroom.\\n\\n I shook my head. \"It\u0027s not mine. It can\u0027t be mine. I was reading them earlier, before she was killed. It must be from another set.\"\\n\\n \"I asked Paal. He only had one set of amethyst stones. He sold it to you.\"\\n\\n I was still shaking my head, hard now. \"No. It can\u0027t be mine. I was using them.\" I looked up from the stone to search his eyes. \"I didn\u0027t kill her, Raphael.\"\\n\\n He closed his fist around the stone and pulled me to his chest. \"I know you didn\u0027t, baby. I didn\u0027t mean to give you the third degree, I just had to ask.\" His kisses were very, very sweet and apologized better than any words could. He put his mouth to my ear and growled in a low, husky voice, \"I don\u0027t want you to leave. I need you.\"\\n\\n Another tear spilled over at the pain caused by his sweet words. \"But not enough to trust me with your secret?\"\\n\\n His arms tightened around me until we were pressed tightly together. \"Ah, baby, I wish everything was different so I could explain it to you, but this is important.\"\\n\\n I tipped my head back so he could see the pain in my eyes. \"And I\u0027m not?\" I asked in a whisper.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re the most important thing in my life,\" he said softly, his eyes glowing. \"It\u0027s because of my feelings for you that I need you to trust me and not ask me for answers I can\u0027t give.\"\\n\\n \"You want my trust but won\u0027t give me yours, is that it?\" I asked, pushing back on his chest until we were separated.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s it,\" he answered, his gaze holding mine.\\n\\n I looked at him for a long time, outwardly calm, but inside, hurt and anger were mixed up with love and the desire to give him what he wanted. I thought about what he meant to me. I weighed my love for him against a lifetime of never mattering as much to him as he did to me.\\n\\n I picked up my clothes. \"I\u0027m sorry, those terms aren\u0027t acceptable to me.\"\\n\\n \"Joy - \"\\n\\n I turned my back to him and pulled on my clothes, tears streaming down my face as I tied my shoelaces. He didn\u0027t say a word, not one blessed word, not one word to stop me from leaving him. Once I was dressed, I paused and stared at his belly tattoo. I didn\u0027t want to look in his eyes. I didn\u0027t want to see the truth mirrored in them. I didn\u0027t want to see how unimportant I was to him.\\n\\n \"Thank you for a lovely evening. I hope you have fun doing whatever it is you are doing. I hope the police don\u0027t find out whatever it is you\u0027re hiding. I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll understand if I decline any further invitations to your little love nest. If you\u0027ll excuse me, I\u0027ll be on my way now.\"\\n\\n \"Baby, look at me.\"\\n\\n The endearment almost broke me, but I fought the desire to throw myself in his arms and swallowed back my misery. \"I\u0027m not your baby. Goodbye, Raphael. Have a nice life.\"\\n\\n He walked me back to my hotel without saying another word.\\n\\n Despite the fact that I had been up most of the night, discovered a body, and been grilled by the police for two hours, I didn\u0027t sleep. Having had my heart crushed by the man I loved more than anything else kept me wide awake. I tossed and turned in my cold, lonely, Raphael-less bed and alternated between a pity party to end all pity parties, and fury that he could treat me in such a callous fashion. In between the two extremes, the voice of reason popped up and pointed out that if I really loved Raphael, I would support him rather than damning him for whatever it was he was unable to share with me.\\n\\n I told the reasonable voice to get stuffed.\\n\\n I tried contacting Christian twice more before the sun crept up out of the mountains, but either he wasn\u0027t receiving me or he had chosen to ignore me. I wished there was something I could do to convince him to answer me, but if there was one thing I\u0027d found in recent days, it was that vampires didn\u0027t like to be pushed around.\\n\\n Roxy looked surprised to find me breakfasting at our usual table next to the window. The sun was out, indicating it was going to be another glorious day weather-wise.\\n\\n \"You look like hell,\" she said, sitting down and grabbing a breakfast roll from the basket, tearing off a piece, and stuffing it into her mouth. \"Where\u0027s your better half? I figured you guys would be shacked up together until all hours making little Raphaels and Joys.\"\\n\\n I grimaced. \"No. That\u0027s all over with.\"\\n\\n She stopped in mid-chew, then gave a big swallow. \"What do you mean it\u0027s all over with? It can\u0027t be all over with, I just decided to give you my blessing. What happened?\"\\n\\n I shrugged and looked back out the window. Nothing had changed out there; it was still the same tranquil scene. Birds flew overhead, people got into cars and drove away, late-blooming flowers bowed and dipped their heads in the wind. Everything was the same. Everything but me.\\n\\n \"Joy?\" Roxy put her hand over mine, her voice worried. \"Honey, what happened? Last night Raphael looked like he couldn\u0027t wait to get back to you.\"\\n\\n I willed myself not to cry. I\u0027d done enough of that during the long night, too. \"He wouldn\u0027t tell me his secret.\"\\n\\n She frowned. \"What secret?\"\\n\\n \"He has some secret, something to do with the police and his past. I think he was convicted of some crime and never really cleared. Dominic knows about it, and is using it to keep him with the fair. I asked Raphael about it, but he said he couldn\u0027t tell me. He could tell Dominic, but he couldn\u0027t tell me. He doesn\u0027t trust me, Roxy. I don\u0027t matter enough to him that he can trust me with some stupid secret about his last job.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t believe for one minute you don\u0027t matter to him. I\u0027ve got eyes, babe. I can see how he looks at you, and it is not the look of a man who\u0027s simply using the closest dipper to drink from the well. He\u0027s crazy about you. Serious crazy, too, which is why I changed my mind and decided that you two were perfect for each other.\"\\n\\n \"But his secret - \"\\n\\n She waved his secret away with a bit of breakfast bread product. \"Have you told him every little secret in your life?\"\\n\\n \"No, of course not, but this isn\u0027t little, this is something big, something serious, something that\u0027s affecting him now and will no doubt continue to affect him in the future. I wouldn\u0027t keep something on that level secret from him.\"\\n\\n She nodded. \"You\u0027re a woman. He\u0027s a man. Women don\u0027t mind asking for help with a problem, while men take it as a slight to their character if they can\u0027t deal with everything themselves. Besides, you both kind of jumped into this relationship quickly. Sometimes trust takes a bit of time to build. I\u0027m sure he\u0027ll change his mind about not telling you whatever it is he\u0027s hiding if you\u0027re patient with him and don\u0027t do anything rash.\"\\n\\n \"Rash like telling him I didn\u0027t want to see him again?\"\\n\\n She stared at me, jam dripping off the spoon she was applying to her roll. \"You didn\u0027t!\"\\n\\n I nodded.\\n\\n \"Oh, geez.\" She slathered the piece of roll and popped it in her mouth. \"Well, we\u0027ll deal with that in good time. We\u0027ll take the most important things first.\"\\n\\n \"Raphael is the most important thing to me,\" I objected.\\n\\n \"I know that,\" she said indistinctly around a mouthful of roll. \"I meant important things as in stuff we must accomplish in order for you to be able to get Raphael where you want him - by the short and curlies.\"\\n\\n I pushed my cup of coffee away untasted. \"Roxy, I don\u0027t understand a thing you\u0027re saying. What things are you talking about?\"\\n\\n She wiped her jammy hands on a napkin before ticking the items off on her fingers. \"One, we find out what Raphael\u0027s secret is.\"\\n\\n I stared at her. \"Have you heard anything I said? He wouldn\u0027t tell me.\"\\n\\n \"We won\u0027t ask him.\" She smiled complacently. \"Two, we determine who killed Tanya.\"\\n\\n I rubbed my forehead. The headache I had been nursing ever since I got up was building. \"Christian killed Tanya,\" I said very slowly, enunciating clearly just in case she couldn\u0027t hear and chew at the same time.\\n\\n She waved her roll - her third roll - at me. \"I don\u0027t buy that. Christian doesn\u0027t seem to me to be the type to kill someone.\"\\n\\n I stared at her. \"Roxy, he drinks people\u0027s blood to survive. He can kill people without touching them. He\u0027s lived for more than nine hundred years, and he\u0027s been turned down repeatedly by the one woman who he thinks can save him. Of course he\u0027s the type to kill! You\u0027re just letting the fact that he\u0027s Dante sway your judgment.\"\\n\\n \"Geez, you really don\u0027t have faith in anyone, do you?\"\\n\\n That stopped me dead.\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t trust Raphael when he asks you to, you believe a man who\u0027s only showed you kindness and given you information that could be used against him is a murdering bastard, and you don\u0027t give me credit for seeing a few things you\u0027re too blind to notice.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry, Rox, I didn\u0027t mean to imply that you aren\u0027t seeing things clearly. I just - it\u0027s just that Christian didn\u0027t share his visions with you. They weren\u0027t nice, Roxy. He\u0027s a very, very powerful man, tormented and in constant battle with himself. It\u0027s because of the blackness I\u0027ve seen within him that I know he is capable of killing.\"\\n\\n \"Has he been anything but gentle with you?\"\\n\\n \"No, but he thinks I\u0027m his Beloved.\"\\n\\n \"Exactly. So why would he take the chance of angering or sickening you by ruthlessly killing someone, knowing full well that you\u0027d guess he was responsible for it?\"\\n\\n I stared at her in surprise. I hadn\u0027t thought of that. Surely Christian must realize I\u0027d know if he killed Tanya.\\n\\n Roxy nodded as the understanding dawned in my eyes. \"If you\u0027re right and he can feed on anyone he wants, it only makes sense that he\u0027d do so away from here, somewhere you wouldn\u0027t hear about it. Killing Tanya just doesn\u0027t make sense.\"\\n\\n I rubbed my forehead again. \"All right, if that\u0027s the case, then who did kill her? And don\u0027t tell me it\u0027s Raphael, because I won\u0027t believe it.\"\\n\\n \"Well, he did have both the opportunity and the motive.\"\\n\\n \"What motive?\" I asked, bristling against my will at the slur on his character.\\n\\n \"His secret, whatever it is. Which brings us back to the list. Once we find out what his secret is and clear him of murdering Tanya, we will know what to do about Dominic.\"\\n\\n \"Dominic?\" I tried to follow her convoluted reasoning. \"You mean about him blackmailing Raphael?\"\\n\\n Something occurred to me as I spoke the words. Dominic had a fight with Tanya the day before she died - he might fill the role of murderer. \"Or about Tanya\u0027s murder? Or both?\"\\n\\n \"Hmm. Dominic as murderer - I suppose it\u0027s possible.\" She shrugged and reached for my pot of coffee, pouring herself a cup and adding an unhealthy dollop of cream. \"Doesn\u0027t matter; either way, we get Dominic off Raphael\u0027s back. If he\u0027s the murderer, he goes to jail. If he\u0027s not and we figure out Raphael\u0027s secret, we apply a little judicious blackmail pressure of our own.\"\\n\\n \"What sort of blackmail pressure?\" I asked suspiciously.\\n\\n \"Who knows? We\u0027ll cross that bridge when we come to it. You want that last roll?\"\\n\\n I stared at it, not seeing it. Raphael\u0027s face loomed large in my mind. \"OK. I guess. I\u0027m game.\"\\n\\n \"Either he\u0027s worth fighting for, or he\u0027s not the one for you,\" Roxy said sagely, buttering the roll.\\n\\n I met her gaze as her words clicked into place. \"He\u0027s worth fighting for.\"\\n\\n \"I thought you\u0027d see it that way. Let\u0027s get a little breffy under our belts, then we\u0027ll tackle item one.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve already eaten enough rolls for two people,\" I pointed out.\\n\\n \"A girl needs her strength when she\u0027s saving her best friend\u0027s romance, not to mention uncovering mysterious secrets and solving a murder.\"\\n\\n \"You sound like an overgrown Nancy Drew,\" I smiled.\\n\\n \"I always liked Nancy. You can be my George.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, hell,\" I said, looking over her shoulder.\\n\\n \"What? You want to be Bess instead? That\u0027s OK with me, but I always thought Bess was a bit of a wet blanket.\"\\n\\n \"No, it\u0027s not that.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t tell me you want to be Hannah Gruen? Wasn\u0027t she elderly? Well, OK, you can be her, but don\u0027t be saying things like \u0027Lawks a-mercy, Miss Nancy\u0027 to me.\"\\n\\n I nodded to the man in the doorway and rose from my chair. \"Will you stop? Inspector Bartos and that flunky of his are here. Eat up, Nancy. I think we\u0027re about to be grilled by the coppers.\"\\n\\n The bar was closed at this time of the morning, which evidently made it a good place for the local cops to interview people. There were four tables set up at opposite corners of the room, each occupied by a policeman. People from the fair staggered in through the outer door, lining the hall, their eyes blurred and red from being short-shifted in the sleep department.\\n\\n A policewoman with a little black moustache held up a hand to stop us as she consulted a list. She said something and waved me forward, but stopped Roxy before she could enter the bar.\\n\\n \"Looks like you\u0027re on your own, George,\" she called out to me as I entered the bar. \"Don\u0027t be so stubborn that you don\u0027t call Ned Nickerson for help if you need it. I\u0027m sure he\u0027d help if he knew you needed it.\"\\n\\n Calling Ned, AKA Bob the Pigheaded, was not going to be a problem, I reflected as I stepped into the bar. He was standing near one of the tables with Inspector Bartos, arguing in a low but vehement voice. Whatever he was saying did not go down well with Bartos, because the latter was shaking his head and looking like he was wishing he could shut Raphael up. I wondered whether Raphael had volunteered to speak to them or if they\u0027d had to drag him in, then lectured myself for having so little faith in the man with whom, even if he did drive me up the wall with his refusal to dish with the truth, I was madly in love.\\n\\n Inspector Bartos spotted me and managed to get a word in to Raphael. I decided the best defense was a strong offense and, raising my chin, marched over to where they both watched me. \"Inspector Bartos, Raphael. You wanted to see me?\" I asked Bartos. \"I told you everything you could possibly want to know last night, several times, in fact. What do you want now?\"\\n\\n Not even Nancy Drew\u0027s brash best friend George would address a police inspector in such an arrogant tone, but I was just about at my limit, and it wasn\u0027t even lunchtime. Inspector Bartos didn\u0027t seem to be offended, however. His voice was mild as he said, \"Mr. St. John was just giving me the benefit of his advice, Miss Randall. If you would wait at that table, I will be available in a very short time.\"\\n\\n \"Mr. St. John is very good at giving advice,\" I told him, ignoring Raphael looming over me. \"It\u0027s taking it that sticks in his craw.\"\\n\\n \"Joy,\" Raphael growled at me in warning, taking my hand.\\n\\n I took it back. \"Unless you have something to confide in me, I don\u0027t believe we have anything to say to each other.\"\\n\\n His eyes turned molten. \"We damned well do.\" He grabbed my head and laid his lips on me so quickly, so hard and fast and full of unspoken demand, that I just stood there and let him kiss me. \"Don\u0027t give up on me,\" he said in a low voice, his eyes burning me as his thumb brushed a line along my jaw. He looked over my head to Inspector Bartos. \"You\u0027re making a mistake, Bartos. I can prove what I\u0027ve said. If you\u0027ll just contact the Heidelberg police - \"\\n\\n \"It is my mistake to make, you agree? Contacting the German police won\u0027t be necessary,\" Bartos told him. \"You will remain available for interview.\"\\n\\n Raphael\u0027s jaw tightened, but he nodded, then looked back at me. His thumb teased my lower lip. \"Remember what I said,\" he warned me, then dropped his hand from my face and left the bar.\\n\\n I stood brainless, bemused, so madly in love that I could just lie down on the floor kicking my heels and having a hissy fit over the way things had turned out, but we Randalls are made of sterner stuff. Raphael gave me much to think about, but unfortunately - \"I am ready for you now, Miss Randall,\" Bartos said behind me.\\n\\n I watched through the window as Raphael strode across the parking lot, heading back to the meadow. He looked so tired and frustrated, I wanted to cradle his head against my breasts and make everything all better.\\n\\n \"Miss Randall?\"\\n\\n Two policemen passed Raphael on their way in to the hotel. He literally stood head and shoulders above them, the very embodiment of masculinity. I sighed. He certainly was perfect, if you were willing to overlook the fact that he was pigheaded and stubborn, had difficulty trusting people, and didn\u0027t want to need anyone.\\n\\n \"Miss Randall, the morning is passing. If it would not be too troublesome, I would like to conduct your interview now.\"\\n\\n Raphael disappeared from view. I turned to look at Bartos, not really seeing him. The conversation Raphael had with Bartos was very interesting. Had he volunteered advice? About the murder in Heidelberg? Perhaps he had decided to come clean with the police regarding his past... then again, the way Bartos demanded he remain available for interview was not a sign the police viewed him as innocent.\\n\\n \"The chair is very comfortable, I assure you. And the table is a fine example of local craftsmanship. If you would just seat yourself, I believe you will agree.\"\\n\\n What did Raphael mean about not giving up on him? What kind of a demand was that for him to make of me? He\u0027d given up on me even before we had a chance, hadn\u0027t he? And just what did give up mean? Ha! I knew what he wanted. He wanted me to fawn all over him, telling him how marvelous he was no matter how terribly he treated me. How dare he expect me to stay devoted to him, consumed by thoughts of him, thinking of him to the exclusion of all else?\\n\\n \"Miss Randall, my wife is expecting me home for dinner this evening. Shall I tell her otherwise?\"\\n\\n Well, I wouldn\u0027t do it! I just wouldn\u0027t! If he wanted a devoted slave, a groupie, he could just look elsewhere. I had too much self-respect to turn myself into a doormat just so his manly ego could stomp all over it. Give up on him, ha!\\n\\n Inspector Bartos sighed, his moustache ruffling with the force of it. I blinked and realized I had been staring at him. \"What? Did you just ask me to dinner?\"\\n\\n His lips compressed to a hard line. \"Have you returned to us?\"\\n\\n \"Returned? What are you talking about? I\u0027ve been standing here waiting for you. Are you ready now?\"\\n\\n He looked like he wanted to sigh again, but shook his head instead. \"Yes, I am ready for you. If you will please sit?\"\\n\\n The interview didn\u0027t cover any new ground. I didn\u0027t understand why they wanted me to go over my actions the night before again and again, but figured maybe they were waiting for me to suddenly crack and admit I killed Tanya, or make some glaring mistake retelling my story that would indicate I was lying through my teeth. I did neither.\\n\\n Until he started asking the hard questions.\\n\\n \"Is it true that two days ago Tanya Renauld said to you\" - he flipped a couple of pages in his notebook - \"that she would only be happy when you were dead?\"\\n\\n My stomach wadded up into a tiny ball and rattled around my body. I wondered who had snitched on me - Roxy? Christian? It had to be Roxy; I doubted the inspector had found Christian before he disappeared for the day. I frowned at that thought, wondering why Christian had remained silent through the night if he was innocent. Could he have been wounded somehow? Restrained by some means? In light of his innocence, his silence took on a new, more worrisome meaning.\\n\\n \"Um... maybe.\"\\n\\n Inspector Bartos looked up from his notebook. \"Maybe? Could you be more specific? Did she threaten you or not?\"\\n\\n My palms started sweating. \"Well... yes, she did. But she was very angry - \"\\n\\n \"Immediately upon threatening your life, did she throw a bucket of water on you?\"\\n\\n There was no use denying it; too many people had seen us. I gnawed on my lower lip and nodded.\\n\\n \"Was it your impression that she was serious in her threats to you?\"\\n\\n I hesitated. I didn\u0027t want to lie, but I couldn\u0027t see what good telling him that she was in deadly earnest would do anyone. \"Although I didn\u0027t really know her, it was fairly obvious that Tanya was a very volatile person. She was also extremely irate over the fact that her boyfriend was using me to make her jealous - without my permission, as I\u0027ve told you a couple of times. Given all that, I would say that at the moment she threw the water on me, she wouldn\u0027t have broken out into sobs if I had dropped down dead on the spot.\"\\n\\n His moustache ruffled a little at that. I watched it, fascinated. It was as if the thing had a life of its own. He flipped through a few more pages. \"Miss Renauld made statements that could be interpreted as threatening to you at other times, did she not?\"\\n\\n \"She was pretty much angry nonstop with me, so it\u0027s no surprise she said nasty things.\" I leaned forward. \"Look, Inspector, I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re driving at with all these questions about Tanya threatening me. She was killed, not me. She held a grudge against me, not vice versa. I was more than happy to go my own way and not have anything to do with her, and I certainly didn\u0027t bear her any ill will other than disliking being used as a pawn by her and Dominic.\"\\n\\n \"A woman has been murdered, Miss Randall,\" Bartos said neutrally, reminding me of Christian at his peacemaking best. \"It is my duty to uncover all the unpleasantness surrounding her death whether or not you believe it has a bearing on the situation.\"\\n\\n My spirits dropped to hang around my knees with the wadded-up ball of my stomach.\\n\\n \"If you would go over the events of the evening one more time, beginning with your conference with Miss Arielle Renauld here in this bar... \"\\n\\n I slumped in my chair. The day stretched before me in a perpetual loop of retelling the same thing over and over and over again.\\n\\n An hour later I stumbled out of the bar, the inspector\u0027s rebuffs echoing in my ears.\\n\\n \"You are under a misimpression, Miss Randall. My role in this investigation is to gather information, not give it,\" he said in response to my question of whether or not Raphael was a suspect. Our interview was at an end, but I had figured there was no better opportunity to try and worm a few facts out about Raphael.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not asking you to tell me what he said to you, just whether or not he\u0027s on your list of suspects. I can\u0027t help but be worried, what with his history with the police... \" I purposely let my sentence trail off in hopes he\u0027d take the bait, but evidently he\u0027d been hooked before.\\n\\n \"Mr. St. John did not inform me that you were acquainted with his past history with the police,\" he said, faint disapproval tingeing his voice.\\n\\n I tried not to squirm under his gimlet eyes. \"Raphael and I are very close, as I have told you. And we have discussed the situation, and the issue of his past.\" Truth - it was all the truth. Misleading, yes, intended to give a false impression that I knew everything, true, but still a form of the truth. \"I\u0027m sure it just escaped his mind to tell you that.\"\\n\\n \"I see. And what do you expect me to tell you?\"\\n\\n \"That you don\u0027t consider him a likely suspect for killing Tanya.\"\\n\\n Inspector Bartos just looked at me out of half-closed eyes.\\n\\n \"Oh, come on,\" I said in response to his silence. \"Just because Raphael has a history involving... well, involving the police doesn\u0027t mean that you can pin this on him. He\u0027s no more likely to have killed Tanya than I am! If I\u0027m not a suspect, there\u0027s no way you can rationally include Raphael on your list of supposed perpetrators.\"\\n\\n He gave me one of his martyred looks. \"Ah, but Miss Randall, when have I given the impression that you are not on that list?\"\\n\\n I stared at him open-mouthed, stunned that he could consider me capable of murder. He took advantage of my speechless state to escort me to the door of the bar, wishing me a good day.\\n\\n I headed straight for the bench out front where I could sit and breath fresh air and enjoy not being questioned. Roxy, who had been interviewed and released before me, was chatting with a group of people getting ready to go on a bike ride.\\n\\n I plopped down beside her with a, \"Well! How do you like that! The good inspector thinks I murdered Tanya!\"\\n\\n Roxy shrugged and called out a goodbye as the bike riders pedaled off.\\n\\n \"What do mean by that shrug?\" I demanded. \"Do you mean you\u0027re not surprised that your best friend in the whole wide world is a murder suspect, or do you mean that it\u0027s all too silly for words, and thus you won\u0027t even try to express your contempt for a man who could say such patently false things?\"\\n\\n \"We need to get you some Valium or something. You\u0027re going postal.\"\\n\\n \"I am not going postal, I\u0027ve just been third degreed. Bartos all but brought out the rubber hose. I\u0027m surprised he didn\u0027t flick a few lit matches on me, just to see if I\u0027d sing.\"\\n\\n Roxy chuckled and got to her feet, pulling me up after her. \"You\u0027ve got your sense of humor back. I\u0027m glad to see you\u0027re not depressed over Tattoo Boy any longer. Come on, we have investigating to do. While you were in there having bamboo shoved under your fingernails, I\u0027ve been busy working.\"\\n\\n \"Working how?\" I asked as we headed toward the meadow and the fair.\\n\\n \"Talking to everyone from the fair who came in to report to the police. Hurry up, we have an appointment with your favorite vampire, and we\u0027re already late.\"\\n\\n \"Christian?\" I looked up. The sun, hazy behind high clouds, was midway through the sky. \"Roxy, even if we knew where he was, you know he\u0027s not awake now.\"\\n\\n \"Not Christian. Dominic.\"\\n\\n \"Ugh. He\u0027s hardly my favorite vampire. He\u0027s not even real.\" A fact I suddenly appreciated, especially when the image of Tanya\u0027s torn throat came to mind. I wondered what Bartos made of that wound. I wondered if he believed in Dark Ones.\\n\\n \"Yes, well, he\u0027s about to become your favorite vampire. I told him you wanted a little information from him, and were willing to exchange your favors for it.\"\\n\\n \"ROXY!\" I stopped dead at the edge of the parking lot. \"I will NOT sleep with fang face!\"\\n\\n \"Did I say you had to? I did not! I said favors, such as reading rune stones.\"\\n\\n \"What? Again? I did it last night to help out in a pinch, but - \"\\n\\n \"If you want the dirt on Raphael, you\u0027re going to have to pay with a little of your time. So make up your mind. Which do you want more - a couple of free hours during the evening, or the scoop on what Raphael\u0027s hiding?\"\\n\\n I kicked at a rock imbedded in the soft soil. To be honest, I was feeling a bit unhappy over the whole idea of sneaking behind Raphael\u0027s back to find out what he was hiding from me. The sane voice in my head pointed out that violating his trust was not the way to demonstrate my love for him. If he wanted you to know, the self-righteous voice intoned, he\u0027d tell you.\\n\\n I seldom listen to that voice. I much prefer the one that snorted indignantly at the idea of sitting around passively and waiting for Raphael to come to his senses. Make him see how much he needs you, that voice said. Show him you are more than just a convenient casing to park his piston.\\n\\n \"OK, I\u0027ll do another stint at the rune table, but just for tonight.\"\\n\\n Roxy whapped me on the arm and started down the slope to the meadow floor. \"Tonight\u0027s the big festival, remember? There is no more fair after tonight.\"\\n\\n I followed her slowly. How could I forget? Tonight hundreds of fans would converge on the grounds of Christian\u0027s castle, drink, eat, dance, and listen to loud music all the while celebrating the cult of the vampire. Meanwhile, the head vampire, the real one, hadn\u0027t been seen or heard from and was up to who knew what. I hoped he was tucked away safely wherever it was he slept.\\n\\n I finally turned my attention to the question I\u0027d asked earlier. If Christian hadn\u0027t murdered Tanya, who did? Dominic? Creepy Milos? Arielle? Raphael? Roxy? Me?\\n\\n I shook the phantoms from my head and picked up the pace, quickly overtaking Roxy. Today was shaping up to be a pretty hellish nightmare of a day. I might as well get as much of it over with as possible. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-girl-s-guide-to-vampires-dark-ones-1/page-15.html","bookId":2190,"book":{"id":2190,"title":"A Girl\u0027s Guide to Vampires (Dark Ones #1)","description":"Storyline: A Girl\u0027s Guide to Vampires (Dark Ones #1) \\n All Joy Randall wants is a little old-fashioned romance, but when she participates in a \"Goddess evoking\" ceremony with her friend, Roxy, Joy finds out her future true love is a man with the potential to put her immortal soul in danger.
