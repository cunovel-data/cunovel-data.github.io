{"id":100630,"no":17,"title":"Page 17","content":"\"Where\u0027s your gun?\" I asked, stepping out of the claustrophobic shower so tiny I wondered how Raphael fit into it.\\n\\n He was dressed, sitting on the bed pulling his boots on, having washed off all our cherry fun. He looked up as I toweled myself dry and reached for my clothes.\\n\\n \"My gun?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah. You know, the one you pulled on us when we did our breaking and entering the other day. The big one.\"\\n\\n \"Why do you want to know?\"\\n\\n I unzipped my dress, stepped into it, and turned so he could zip me up. \"Idle curiosity. I thought maybe since you were in charge of security you\u0027d be wearing it, but you haven\u0027t, and it\u0027s not under your pillow, so I was just wondering what you did with it.\"\\n\\n His hands were warm on my back as he pulled the zipper up; then he turned me around and looked at me for a minute with those amber eyes that could melt my knees. With a sigh, he bent down and reached under his bed, pulling out a small black metal box.\\n\\n \"Oh, it\u0027s in there?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"Ah.\"\\n\\n He pushed the box back under the bed, then grabbed my hips and pulled me onto his lap. \"Joy, about what you said earlier - \"\\n\\n \"Oh, my apology? Yeah, I know I still owe it to you.\"\\n\\n \"No, about - \"\\n\\n I put my hand across his mouth. \"Let me do this with style, will you? I really am sorry for what I said, Raphael. You\u0027re entitled to your privacy, and if you don\u0027t feel like you can trust me with something in your past, that\u0027s fine. It hurts me, but I\u0027ll live. I just want you to know that, despite the pain I feel because I know I\u0027m not as important to you as you are to me, I will still be here for you. I love you, and that means I\u0027m stuck with you no matter how badly you treat me.\"\\n\\n I pulled my hand from his mouth and smiled at him, pleased I had gotten my groveling out of the way.\\n\\n There was a decidedly disgruntled look on his handsome face. \"That was an apology?\"\\n\\n \"Sure was.\"\\n\\n \"Ah. Perhaps it is the latest rage in apologies - one that backhands the person you\u0027re apologizing to.\"\\n\\n I nudged him on the shoulder. \"Stop being so argumentative. You\u0027re supposed to accept it and tell me you love me and worship me and you\u0027ll never, ever keep anything from me again.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m supposed to do that, am I?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, you are.\"\\n\\n He tipped me over onto my back and loomed over me. I smiled and looped my hands around his neck.\\n\\n \"And you came all this way just to apologize to me?\"\\n\\n He started nibbling on my neck, his hot breath starting familiar fires that had just been put out.\\n\\n \"Well, not just for that. Roxy and I had to talk to Dominic.\"\\n\\n \"Why?\" he asked, his hands sliding up my dress to massage my breasts.\\n\\n I squirmed and lifted my jaw to give him better access to all the sensitive neck spots, my hands tracing out the muscles in his back. \"Roxy set it up. Dominic had something to tell us.\"\\n\\n \"Something about what?\" His tongue curled around the outer edges of my ear, his uneven breath doing more to me than the hot touch of his mouth.\\n\\n \"Something to help us. Oh, God, Raphael, you can\u0027t do this again, we just got cleaned up!\"\\n\\n \"Something to help you what?\" he asked, sucking my earlobe into his mouth as he gently squeezed my breasts.\\n\\n I nuzzled his cheek and tried to remember what I wasn\u0027t supposed to tell him. \"We\u0027re trying to find out who killed Tanya.\"\\n\\n He froze for a moment, then released my ear to look into my eyes. \"Why?\"\\n\\n I traced my fingers across his silky eyebrows. \"Because you\u0027re a suspect. So am I, although I don\u0027t think Inspector Bartos was serious about that. I hope he wasn\u0027t serious. But you... he doesn\u0027t seem very happy about you. And, Raphael, say what I will about you being pigheaded and stubborn, you\u0027re everything to me. I can\u0027t lose you. I won\u0027t let him take you from me. So if Roxy and I have to do a little detective work to prove you\u0027re innocent, we will.\"\\n\\n He kissed me, hot and demanding. \"You\u0027re the most amazing woman. I\u0027ve never known anyone as giving as you.\" I opened my mouth to tell him that was the sort of thing I wanted to hear, but he silenced me with another hot kiss. \"Regardless, I can\u0027t let you do this. I appreciate that you want to help me, but you don\u0027t have anything to worry about.\"\\n\\n \"But Inspector Bartos - \"\\n\\n \"Leave the detecting to the police, Joy.\"\\n\\n I pushed him back so I could sit up. \"Look, I have enough on my plate right now, what with having to deal with Christian, I do not need you locked up in jail on a trumped up murder charge simply because I didn\u0027t make the effort to prove you\u0027re innocent.\"\\n\\n He took hold of the back of my dress and kept me from getting off the bed. \"You don\u0027t have to prove I\u0027m innocent; the police know I am. What do you mean, you have to deal with Christian?\"\\n\\n I gave him a look of sheer disbelief. \"Oh, sure, the police know you\u0027re innocent. That\u0027s why you\u0027re heading up their suspect list.\"\\n\\n \"What has Christian done? Why do you have to deal with him?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t want to talk about Christian, I want to talk about saving you, you arrogant, maddening man! Why I want to save your annoying, if extremely dishy, hide, I don\u0027t know, but I mean to, so you can just stop being all macho and ordering me around and - \"\\n\\n \"Joy.\" He took my face in his hands and leveled a look at me that shriveled the words up on my lips. \"You will not investigate this murder any further. The man who killed Tanya has not been apprehended, and until he is, you are not safe. Do you understand me?\"\\n\\n \"Of course I understand you - you\u0027re being possessive and dominating - \"\\n\\n Raphael rolled his eyes, muttered something that sounded like an oath, and pulled me forward, his kiss hot enough to take the curl right out of my hair. \"I\u0027m telling you I love you, you foolish woman.\"\\n\\n \"You are?\" I asked, breathless from the power of his kiss.\\n\\n His eyes were things of beauty, gems of the brightest quality, clear and translucent and filled with love. Somehow his declaration took the sting out of his bossiness.\\n\\n \"I am. I love you and worship you, and after this is over, I\u0027ll never keep anything from you.\"\\n\\n It was exactly what I wanted to hear, what I needed to hear. He was acknowledging my concerns and fears, and promised to answer all my questions... after it was over? I stopped him just a hairsbreadth from my lips. \"What do you mean, after this is over? Raphael, you could be in jail then!\"\\n\\n His fingers curled into my hair, teasing my nape. \"Baby, I won\u0027t go to jail.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s to keep you out this time?\"\\n\\n I regretted the words as soon as they left my lips. His fingers stop stroking my neck.\\n\\n \"This time?\" His gaze held mine. I stared at him, my heart tearing into a thousand pieces at the flicker of pain in his eyes, a layer of ice settling around me as he pushed me off his lap and cocked an eyebrow at me. \"I see. That\u0027s the information you wanted from Dominic. Do you mind my asking how you expect to use what Dominic told you to prove who the murderer is?\"\\n\\n \"That wasn\u0027t exactly the purpose of our meeting with him,\" I said miserably, tears starting at the back of my eyes. \"I\u0027m sorry, Raphael. I\u0027m very sorry and ashamed of myself. I don\u0027t like poking into your past, I just want to help you. I want to keep you safe, and since you won\u0027t tell me what it is you are keeping from me, I thought if I knew, I\u0027d be able to do whatever it takes to keep Inspector Bartos away from you.\"\\n\\n He watched for a moment as tears streaked down my cheeks, then wrapped his arms around me and pulled me to his chest. I buried my face in his neck and watered his shirt. \"Baby, I wish I could tell you everything,\" he said, his lips in my hair. \"I wish I could, but it\u0027s not possible yet. You have to trust me just a little bit longer.\"\\n\\n \"I do trust you; it\u0027s you who doesn\u0027t trust me,\" I pointed out, sniffing and wiping the dampness of my tears off his neck.\\n\\n He didn\u0027t say anything to that, just thumbed the tears off my cheeks and looked at me with eyes dark with longing, regret, and pain.\\n\\n \"What is the problem you\u0027re having with Christian?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re changing the subject.\"\\n\\n \"I know I am. What is the problem you\u0027re having with Christian?\"\\n\\n \"This hasn\u0027t resolved anything. Even if Roxy and I don\u0027t go after the murderer, I\u0027ll still be worried about you, and will continue to worry until Bartos has someone other than you under lock and key.\"\\n\\n \"If it will make you feel better, Joy, I will swear to you that he won\u0027t arrest me for Tanya\u0027s murder.\"\\n\\n \"How can you swear that?\"\\n\\n His eyes went darker.\\n\\n I looked into them and saw the answer for myself. He was still keeping things from me, still hiding secrets that he wouldn\u0027t share, but that was no longer the issue it had been earlier. He loved me. I had to trust that in time, he would tell me everything.\\n\\n \"I should be going. I\u0027ve got a lot to do, and I imagine you do as well.\" I got up from the bed and gathered my coat and purse.\\n\\n He stopped me. \"What is the problem with Christian?\"\\n\\n I thought about not telling him, but decided he would be safer knowing the truth. \"Nothing\u0027s the problem with him, unless you count a nine-hundred-year-old vampire as a problem, unless you find the fact that your mind and body and soul can be invaded by him with the merest thought of his mind a problem. Problem? I don\u0027t know - is it a problem to have an immortal man with limitless power thinking you\u0027re the sole person in the entire history of time who can save him from eternal damnation?\"\\n\\n \"Vampire?\" Raphael couldn\u0027t have looked more surprised than if I\u0027d stripped off all my clothes and stood on my head. \"You don\u0027t mean to tell me that you actually believe he\u0027s one of those creatures he writes about?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, I don\u0027t just believe it, buster, I know.\"\\n\\n Disbelief was rampant in his eyes.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t you give me that look,\" I warned, pointing my finger at him. \"Don\u0027t you give me that \u0027She\u0027s mad, I\u0027ll humor her because I\u0027m a manly sort of man and she\u0027s my woman and thus I must put up with all of her foolishness and pretend it\u0027s not foolish at all even though inside I\u0027m laughing so hard I could break my spleen\u0027 look! I am not mad, and I\u0027m not imagining it.\"\\n\\n \"Joy,\" he sighed, taking my hands in his. I tried to take them back, but he was too strong. \"I know you\u0027re upset about this murder and the fact that I\u0027ve got a job to do - \"\\n\\n \"What job?\" I interrupted him, suspicious. \"You mean something other than just your security work? Do you have another job? A secret job? Something else you aren\u0027t telling me?\"\\n\\n \" - and I know you and Roxy are enamored with Christian because he writes books you enjoy, but, no matter what he tells you, there is no such thing as a vampire.\"\\n\\n I turned my hands so I could pinch his wrists. \"I used to think that too. I thought Roxy was nuts for wanting to come here, but then the visions started, and then he started making midnight visits to me in bed - \"\\n\\n \"WHAT?\"\\n\\n \" - and I have to tell you, being seduced long distance by someone\u0027s mind goes a long way into making a believer out of you.\"\\n\\n Raphael stared at me for a minute, as though seeking the truth in my eyes, then let go of my hands so he could rub his jaw. \"Joy, I don\u0027t know what you\u0027ve experienced, but I do know it can\u0027t be real.\"\\n\\n \"It is real, Raphael. I didn\u0027t know it was him at first - I thought it might be Milos or someone - but then Christian admitted it when we were in his dungeon. Roxy heard him.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s bamming you, love.\"\\n\\n \"No, he\u0027s not. I know what I felt! He invaded my mind. He touched me, physically, only he wasn\u0027t in the same room.\"\\n\\n Raphael\u0027s frown deepened. \"Touched you how?\"\\n\\n I held his gaze. \"As a lover might.\"\\n\\n The muscles in his jaw flexed. \"He\u0027s drugged you. He\u0027s drugged you with something to make you see visions and believe he has supernatural powers.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, God, Raphael, he hasn\u0027t drugged me - \"\\n\\n \"Baby, there\u0027s nothing you can say to make me believe that anyone is a vampire, least of all Christian. A parasite, a psychotic madman bent on seducing you, a poor fool who\u0027s deluded himself into believing his stories are real, yes, he\u0027s all that, but not a real vampire. They just... don\u0027t... exist.\"\\n\\n \"Well, we\u0027re going to have to agree to disagree here, because I know what I know.\" I stuffed my arms into my coat.\\n\\n \"Damn it, woman, there is no such thing as a vampire!\" He grabbed my coat as I stepped into my shoes. I tried to walk past him, but he caught my chin in his hand and tipped my head back so he could fire those amber eyes at me. \"This is not arrogance talking, this is not jealousy, it is simply a matter of facts.\"\\n\\n I stared at him for a few seconds, wondering if he knew the danger he was putting himself in by being so blind. So stubborn. So determined to not need anyone\u0027s help. \"I don\u0027t blame you for not believing me. I didn\u0027t believe it at first either, not even when Christian invaded my head. But it is the truth, and pretending it\u0027s not won\u0027t make it go away.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t need to pretend to make Christian go away,\" he growled, grabbing me and hauling me up against his chest. His eyes were dark with emotion, frustration and love and anger all mingled together.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re hurting me,\" I whispered against his lips. He gentled his hold on my neck, then dropped his hands from me altogether, stepping back to release me.\\n\\n I looked at the man I loved with my heart and soul, and swore an oath that I would not let his stubbornness ruin our lives. He might not want me playing detective, he might not believe that Christian was who I knew he was, but I could, and would, do whatever it took to keep disaster from rolling over us. Slowly I gathered up my things.\\n\\n \"Do you understand what I\u0027m saying, Joy? Christian is nothing to us.\"\\n\\n I stood still for a moment, then nodded and turned to leave. Oh, I understood him. The problem was, he wouldn\u0027t believe what he couldn\u0027t see. I opened the door, curiosity forcing me to stop on the top step and ask, \"You know who killed Tanya, don\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n He came up behind me, standing so close I could feel the heat from his chest. \"Yes, I do.\"\\n\\n I looked at my hand on the door latch. \"Is it Milos?\"\\n\\n I felt rather than saw him stiffen.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s always given me the creeps. Now I know why. I\u0027ll see you tonight at the festival?\"\\n\\n \"Joy, I don\u0027t want you to - \"\\n\\n I opened the door and walked down the steps. Outside the sun was still shining, the men were still breaking down the booths and tents to reassemble on Christian\u0027s land. Everything was the same, and yet everything was different.\\n\\n A warm hand settled on my neck, gently this time, his thumb rubbing away the sting of his earlier hold. I turned and slid my hands under his coat, holding him close, breathing in his wonderful smell. He wrapped his arms around me, holding me just as tightly.\\n\\n \"I won\u0027t go near Milos if that\u0027s what you\u0027re about to order,\" I whispered, kissing his ear.\\n\\n \"This is not a game, Joy.\"\\n\\n I kissed his chin, his obstinate, blunt chin that I loved so much. He still thought I was upset because he wouldn\u0027t admit to me what he was really doing with the fair. Silly man. \"I know it\u0027s not a game.\"\\n\\n \"If you persist in playing detective, I\u0027ll have to spend my time keeping an eye on you rather than proving the murderer\u0027s guilt to Bartos. I need this time, Joy. I\u0027m not going to have another chance.\"\\n\\n \"And if you don\u0027t succeed?\" I tipped my head back to examine his eyes. They were hard again, just as determined and stubborn as the rest of him. \"What happens if you don\u0027t convince Bartos? What happens if the festival ends and the fair moves on without you? What then?\"\\n\\n He rubbed his thumb over my lower lip. I bit it. \"Then my future is written for me.\"\\n\\n My heart tightened painfully. \"And it won\u0027t include me?\"\\n\\n He didn\u0027t answer me right away. \"Let me do my job. Let me do it without worrying about you. I need to know you\u0027re safe, otherwise this won\u0027t end.\"\\n\\n I nodded and started to pull away, but his arms tightened around me. \"Please, baby. You wanted to help me, now I\u0027m giving you the chance to. Stay away from Milos.\"\\n\\n He wasn\u0027t asking, he was demanding, but now wasn\u0027t the time to argue over words. I nodded again and slipped out of his embrace, giving him one last very gentle kiss before starting off to find Roxy.\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s see,\" Roxy said, circling around me as I stood outside Arielle\u0027s trailer. \"Hair: mussed. Lips: swollen with impassioned kissing. Dress: wrinkled, as if it had lain on the floor for a while. Face: blushing. Yep. All signs you had a really good talk with Raphael.\"\\n\\n \"You are an obnoxiously bad woman and you will be punished one day.\"\\n\\n She grinned and fell into step as we started back to the hotel. \"I take it by the sated look you\u0027re wearing that all is right in Raphael-land?\"\\n\\n \"Relatively,\" I admitted. \"Somewhat. Kind of. How is Arielle?\"\\n\\n Her grin fizzled away into nothing. \"Upset, worried, and frightened. But she\u0027ll survive. Her boyfriend is hanging around, keeping an eye on her. I think he\u0027ll make sure she doesn\u0027t suffer more than she has to.\"\\n\\n I stopped. \"Maybe I should see her now rather than later?\"\\n\\n \"No. Paal gave her a couple of sleeping pills; she\u0027ll be out until the festival tonight. Come on, it\u0027s lunchtime and I\u0027m hungry. I\u0027m willing to bet that man of yours didn\u0027t feed you, either.\" She shot me a knowing glance. \"At least, not food.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, grow up!\"\\n\\n \"So let me get this straight,\" she said a short time later as we sat over bowls of vegetable soup and fresh baked bread. \"You\u0027ve done a one-eighty on the whole \u0027he won\u0027t tell me his secrets\u0027 issue?\"\\n\\n \"Right. He loves me. He\u0027ll tell me when he\u0027s ready to.\"\\n\\n \"Wow. You really have grown up, haven\u0027t you? So then, why the long face?\"\\n\\n \"Raphael doesn\u0027t believe Christian is a Dark One. He\u0027s letting his stubbornness blind him.\"\\n\\n \"So?\" Roxy stuffed a roll in her mouth, crumbs drifting onto the table as she spoke. \"I admit that he\u0027s being stupid about it, but what\u0027s the big deal? You get Christian to show a little fang, and voil¨¤! Instant believer.\"\\n\\n I stirred my soup. \"The problem is that Raphael\u0027s letting his stubbornness blind him about everything. It\u0027s not just Christian, it\u0027s the whole thing with Inspector Bartos, too.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re just a control freak, that\u0027s your problem. You want Raphael to admit you\u0027re right and he\u0027s wrong.\"\\n\\n I threw my bread at her. She caught it and took a bite.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not nearly as simple as that. For one thing, Raphael is in danger of being arrested again. Call me silly, but I\u0027d like to avoid that. I really don\u0027t want to spend the rest of my life hanging around a Czech prison begging for visitation rights.\"\\n\\n She crumbled the bread into her soup. \"He says he\u0027s not in danger of being arrested.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, well, he didn\u0027t hear Inspector Bartos say he was a suspect. You think the police are going to tell he\u0027s on the list? They don\u0027t want him to have his guard up! They want him to feel secure so he\u0027ll slip up and they can nab him and take him away from me.\" I took a deep breath and slammed the flat of my hand onto the table. \"I\u0027m not going to let them do that! Raphael doesn\u0027t want me getting involved with finding out who the murderer is, but he didn\u0027t say I couldn\u0027t find someone who can do it for me.\"\\n\\n \"Who\u0027s that?\" she asked, her head tipped to the side.\\n\\n \"Christian,\" I said without thinking. \"He can read minds, can\u0027t he? I\u0027m sure Milos is the murderer, so all I have to do is ask Christian to read his mind and find a little tangible proof for the police.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, right, and Christian is going to help you save your lover, the man whose job he wants?\"\\n\\n I waved that issue away. \"He\u0027ll help me, I know he will. How much time do we have before it starts to get dark?\"\\n\\n She glanced at her watch. \"Four, maybe five hours.\"\\n\\n \"Good. That gives us time to catch a little sleep. The festival won\u0027t be starting until nine or so, so we should have a good three hours to find Christian and have him scan Milos\u0027s mind.\"\\n\\n \"We?\"\\n\\n \"I assumed you were going to help me.\"\\n\\n She sighed and dunked my bread in her soup. \"I suppose I\u0027ll have to keep you in line if I want to see you and Raphael settled happily. I just wish I knew why you didn\u0027t trust him to take care of himself.\"\\n\\n \"Of course I trust him, the man\u0027s a spy. He\u0027s perfectly able to take care of himself physically.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s what?\" Roxy shrieked.\\n\\n I glanced around the nearly empty room, smiling wildly at the elderly couple who were giving us frowns. \"Shhh! You want everyone to hear?\"\\n\\n She goggled for a moment, then grabbed my wrist, leaning forward to hiss at me. \"What do you mean he\u0027s a spy? Raphael?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, Raphael, a spy. Or a government agent of some sort. Honestly, Rox, I thought you would have figured it out by now.\"\\n\\n \"Did he tell you that?\"\\n\\n I gave her one of the many patient looks I save just for her. \"No, of course he didn\u0027t, that would qualify as secret-telling. It\u0027s obvious, though. Raphael is clearly not in the least bit concerned about the police other than seeing Milos brought to justice. He carries a gun, and who knows what else he has locked away in that metal chest. Probably his spy papers or something. And that cock-and-bull story about him raping a woman and killing her is just too ridiculous for words. It\u0027s just the sort of thing those spy places would make up. Thus, he must be working undercover to figure out who the murderer is. Let go of my arm, it\u0027s starting to hurt.\"\\n\\n \"Damn, girl, you take the cake,\" she answered, releasing my wrist. \"I just hate it when you outguess me. So now you know his secret, right? Are you going to tell him?\"\\n\\n \"And puncture his ego? No way. Behind every good man stands an exceptional woman, and I am that woman. I\u0027ll just make sure that Inspector Bartos doesn\u0027t nab Raphael by mistake, and never tell him I helped.\"\\n\\n \"Why would Inspector Bartos want to nab Raphael if he\u0027s a spy?\"\\n\\n I rolled my eyes as I picked up my spoon. \"He\u0027s undercover, silly. If he reveals himself to Bartos, word could get back to Milos and then the whole case will be blown. You need to read more spy books.\"\\n\\n We spent the next half hour detailing our plans for the evening. I was heading upstairs to take a much-needed nap when Roxy - on her way to the bar to ogle the natives - stopped me with a question. \"You do realize what Raphael did, don\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n \"When?\"\\n\\n \"Earlier. He took the sixth step to Joining by asking for your help. Now all that\u0027s left is for you two to complete a blood exchange.\"\\n\\n I made a face as I continued up the stairs. \"That, I can assure you, is not going to happen.\"\\n\\n A few hours of nap time, and I was feeling much more optimistic that the plan we\u0027d agreed on would actually work. I pulled out the long blue and green peasant skirt I\u0027d bought in Brno, and added a frilly silk blouse and an oversized paisley scarf that doubled as a shawl.\\n\\n \"Going with the gypsy look?\" Roxy asked, poking her head into my room.\\n\\n \"Yup. You remember everything you\u0027re supposed to do?\"\\n\\n \"Keep an eye on Arielle, warn you whenever I see Raphael, and act as courier whenever you need a message sent to Christian.\"\\n\\n \"Right.\" I pulled on my underwear and the ruffled petticoat I\u0027d bought with the skirt.\\n\\n \"I have a question.\"\\n\\n \"Shoot.\"\\n\\n \"Why do I have to act as courier for you when you can just call Christian up on the mind-phone?\"\\n\\n I shivered. \"I told you earlier, I don\u0027t want to do that. It\u0027s a very intimate thing, and the less intimacy I have with Christian, the happier I am. Besides, he\u0027s not answering me.\"\\n\\n \"You make him sound so dangerous.\"\\n\\n \"He is dangerous. Very dangerous. You have no idea of the torment he\u0027s in, what he\u0027s capable of, but I am.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027d never hurt you.\"\\n\\n I tucked the blouse into the skirt and draped the scarf around my waist, a la gypsy, then turned to look at her. \"It\u0027s not me I\u0027m worried about him hurting.\"\\n\\n She pursed her lips in a silent whistle and admitted I might have a point.\\n\\n By the time we left the hotel, the sun was just sinking down behind the indigo mountains.\\n\\n \"You are going to be done in time for the magic show, aren\u0027t you?\" Roxy asked as we settled back into the ancient Peugeot taxi. \"Believe it or not, Dominic is really great at it. Even Christian was impressed with some of the illusions he did.\"\\n\\n \"I should be done with the readings by then. Tell me again when you and Christian parted ways last night.\"\\n\\n \"He left right after the magic show. Said he\u0027d heard all he could take of the bands, and since you were nowhere to be found, he said he\u0027d see us tonight, before the festival.\"\\n\\n \"Hmm.\"\\n\\n \"Why? What are you thinking?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not sure. I just can\u0027t help wondering why he disappeared, and didn\u0027t try to seduce me. I can\u0027t shake the feeling that something is going on with him, that something isn\u0027t right.\"\\n\\n She didn\u0027t say anything to that, but cast me occasional worried glances. I looked out into the darkening night and wondered what Raphael was doing, and if he was thinking about me even half as much as I was thinking about him.\\n\\n \"Boy, do I have it bad,\" I muttered to myself.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s the understatement of the year,\" Roxy grinned. She gave my hand a little squeeze. \"However, I have to admit I don\u0027t really blame you. Raphael\u0027s kind of cute, in an immense, overpowering sort of way.\"\\n\\n There was nothing that could be said in response that she wouldn\u0027t interpret as the smutty imaginings of my mind, so I just looked out into the night and tried to construct convincing arguments for Christian to help nail Milos. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-girl-s-guide-to-vampires-dark-ones-1/page-17.html","bookId":2190,"book":{"id":2190,"title":"A Girl\u0027s Guide to Vampires (Dark Ones #1)","description":"Storyline: A Girl\u0027s Guide to Vampires (Dark Ones #1) \\n All Joy Randall wants is a little old-fashioned romance, but when she participates in a \"Goddess evoking\" ceremony with her friend, Roxy, Joy finds out her future true love is a man with the potential to put her immortal soul in danger.
