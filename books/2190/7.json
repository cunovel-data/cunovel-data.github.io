{"id":100620,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"Because the real moneymaking attraction of the evening - the Goth bands - wasn\u0027t slated to start until later, the people who were present during the early hours of the fair were almost normal looking. Yes, there was PVC and vinyl and thick, clunky-looking shoes, and black, black, black everywhere, but there were also a lot of couples, young people in small groups walking around giggling and pointing out the oddities to each other, and even some families, although I noticed that admittance to several of the more questionable attractions was limited to those over the age of twelve.\n Czech, German, and French were the predominant languages heard, with a smattering of English here and there, giving truth to what Christian had said earlier about people traveling to the area from all over Europe for the All Hallow\u0027s Eve celebration.\n I worked my way through the thickening crowd, heading for the booth with a sign painted with a big blue hand garnished with a gilt Mannaz, one of the rune symbols used in divination. Happily for me, the next-door booth - Tanya\u0027s tarot card booth - was vacant. Although I had no qualms about facing her again, I didn\u0027t particularly want to encourage another scene like the one we\u0027d been through earlier. I figured Tanya must be off casting spells and grinding up warts for love potions, which suited me just fine.\n Arielle was seated at a low table covered with the standard moon-and-stars cloth you see at a lot of occult shops, cupping a blond twenty-something\u0027s hands in hers as her fingers traced lines on the woman\u0027s palm.\n \"Your life line is very long and very strong. This is always a good sign,\" she told the woman in German. She gave a shy smile to the man standing behind the woman\u0027s shoulder. \"You have only one marriage line.\"\n The blond woman tittered and turned to shoot coy looks from under her lashes to her companion.\n \"Your heart line joins your line of head, so in relationships, your head very much controls your heart.\"\n The woman dimpled at her, pleased. I waved at Arielle and got in line behind the couple. So far what I\u0027d heard was pretty standard fare - generalizations and vague concepts that were meant to send the customer away with a warm, happy glow.\n \"You have only one infinitesimal line of fate. This means that fate will not play too much of a role in your life. This is good, you understand? It means you are in control of your life.\"\n \"Oh, yes, very good,\" the woman agreed, starting to get into the reading. \"I like to be in control.\"\n Her companion snorted in obvious agreement. She ignored him, peering into her palm as Arielle pointed out a bump. \"Your inner Mount of Mars indicates aggressiveness, but your outer Mount of Mars indicates self-control, so sometimes you find yourself wanting to push everyone out of your way, but you hold yourself in check.\"\n The woman was nodding at everything Arielle said, her brows drawn together as she watched Arielle point to her fingertips and describe how they indicated she was a creative, artistic person. Five minutes later, Arielle concluded that the woman would have two children, travel extensively, and have intermittent luck throughout her long life. The German woman, all smiles after the reading, handed over the reading fee, slipping Arielle an extra couple hundred koruna as a tip before heading off to have something on her boyfriend pierced (Nostrils? Nipples? My German wasn\u0027t up to anatomical piercing dialogue).\n \"Good evening, Joy,\" Arielle greeted me in her softly accented English. \"How is your head feeling?\"\n \"Much better. I\u0027d like you to read the runes for me, but first... \" I gnawed on my lower lip and looked around us. Since the fair had just opened, there weren\u0027t a lot of people lining up for readings yet, and we were fairly private at the end of the row of booths. \"I was wondering if you could tell me where Raphael might be.\"\n She gave me a conspiratorial wink. \"He is very handsome, yes?\"\n My cheeks started to pink up. I just hoped that in the washed-out light of the bulbs overhead, she wouldn\u0027t see me blushing like a virgin. \"Um... I guess. Do you know where he is?\"\n She gave one of those eloquent shrugs that only the French seem to know how to make. \"I do not. He generally checks in to see how I am doing before Dominic\u0027s show, when he watches the crowds in the main tent. Otherwise, he promenades the fair and keeps control of the people.\"\n \"Ah. OK. I\u0027ll just keep my eyes peeled for him promenading.\" I waved at a velvet cloth bag sitting at the end of the table. \"Would you do a reading for me?\"\n \"With pleasure,\" she answered, pulling out a casting cloth of garishly colored red and gold, \"although I am very new to it, and the readings are not very strong within me yet.\"\n \"No problem. To tell you the truth, I\u0027m just killing a bit of time until Roxy and Christian get tired of playing on the rack.\"\n She paused as she reached into the bag. \"The rack?\"\n \"Nothing. Go ahead, I didn\u0027t mean to interrupt you.\"\n She scattered glossy black hematite stones painted with gold runes on the cloth, and asked me in her professional, chatty voice if I was familiar with rune stones, then suddenly caught herself and said in her normal voice, \"Oh, but Roxy said you read runes. Please forgive me, I didn\u0027t mean to insult.\"\n \"You didn\u0027t in the least,\" I assured her.\n She put her professional face back on and started her patter back up, instructing me to think of a question or issue for which I sought an answer.\n \"When you have your question firmly fixed in your mind, please select five stones that call out to you.\"\n I looked at the stones scattered on the casting cloth. I\u0027d never done a reading in that manner, but I figured it was good to learn new things, so I closed my eyes and picked out five stones.\n \"Very good,\" she said, scooping up the remainder and slipping them into the bag, then placing the five chosen stones in a cross arrangement. \"I do the Cross of Thor spread for you now.\"\n I nodded. I prefer the nine-stone Odin\u0027s hammer layout myself, feeling that bigger is better, but I figured maybe the rule at the fair was to give the customer a quick, easily generalized reading and send them on their way.\n \"The first stone is Dagaz, and it is the rune for the present. Dagaz means daylight or the light of divinity. It is the rune of dawn or midday, and is symbolic of illumination.\"\n \"Ah. Illumination.\" I felt anything but illuminated by her vague interpretation of the stone, but before I could ask her what she thought the illumination indicated, she was on to the next stone.\n She went through the rest of the reading in quick order, giving me predictions for the obstacles and assistance I\u0027d find, as well as my past and future, all in relationship to my question. It was all very positive, very generic, and completely uninspired. When she was finished, I hesitated for a moment before glancing behind me to be sure no one was waiting for a reading, then turned back to Arielle.\n \"I hope you won\u0027t be offended by what I\u0027m going to say, but I couldn\u0027t help noticing that you\u0027re using the standard interpretation of the runes.\"\n \"Yes,\" she acknowledged, her face a picture of misery. \"I\u0027m sorry, but I am not very good at it. Claude, our palmist, used to read the runes as well. He was good, very good. He taught me to read palms, but I hadn\u0027t learned the runes when he left, and yet they are very popular, so... \" She gave another little shrug.\n \"You\u0027re not bad at all,\" I reassured her, not wishing to hurt her feelings. \"And I\u0027m far from an expert on the subject, but the rune stone book I read said if you were going to do a reading for someone, you should make it personal. It said that anyone, even a computer, can give a standard interpretation, but the real power in a reading - this is the book talking, not me, because I don\u0027t really believe in stuff like... er... never mind - the book said the real power in a reading came from the person interpreting the reading.\"\n \"Ah, yes, I see.\" Arielle looked confused. \"What do you mean by personal? I do not ask the people I\u0027m reading for to tell me their question, so I don\u0027t understand how I can make it personal.\"\n I thought for a minute. \"Well, the couple of times I\u0027ve done readings, I\u0027ve tried to look beyond the standard interpretations, using the stones\u0027 meanings as a sort of self-help tool. For instance, the first stone here, Dagaz - that\u0027s not just the stone of daylight and illumination, it\u0027s a stone indicating a breakthrough, a great change, an awakening, if you will. In its position of the present, it indicates that the person you\u0027re reading for is standing on a point of no return. The illumination part comes in because the light banishes the darkness, completely wiping it away with a brilliant light. Taken with the other stones\" - I waved my hand over the cross - \"I would suggest to the readee that they are starting a new chapter in their life, and although the pages are blank, they alone dictate what will be written on them. In other words, it\u0027s kind of positive reinforcement to take the bull by the horns and make the most out of their life.\"\n \"That is very interesting. What do you make of this stone?\" She tapped the stone indicating the forces acting against me, one whose definition she had particularly stumbled over.\n \"Mannaz reversed - not a good stone in this position, eh?\" I grinned at her.\n She gave me a feeble smile in return.\n \"OK, well, I\u0027d read this rune as a warning against becoming too self-focused and oblivious to others\u0027 feelings. This stone says to me that pretty much everyone is lining up to take a swing at you. It says that the very passions and opinions that make you who you are are rubbing some people the wrong way. So in the position of obstacle, it acts as a reminder that it\u0027s important to take responsibility for your own actions and not indulge in contempt for those around you who you think are inferior, because underestimating them will bring you down in the end.\"\n \"Oh, that\u0027s so true,\" she said breathily, her eyes wide with amazement. \"You are very good at this. Have you done this for a long time?\"\n I laughed and scooped up the five cold hematite stones, handing them back to her. \"I\u0027ve done readings in public exactly one time, and that didn\u0027t turn out terribly well.\"\n \"You should read them professionally,\" she insisted. \"You have the strength within you, I can see. You have the true gift. It is not everyone who is so blessed.\"\n \"Well,\" I said modestly, not wanting her to get started on Roxy\u0027s half-baked and thankfully stunted idea of me reading the runes for the fair while it was in town, \"I can\u0027t see anyone wanting to pay me to read the runes. To tell you the truth, I don\u0027t hold a lot of belief in their power as anything but a tool to self-awareness, and truly, I really don\u0027t know that much about them.\"\n \"That is quite obvious,\" a snotty voice growled behind me.\n \"Hello, Tanya.\" I stood and smiled at the woman who scowled fiercely at me in return. \"Run out of cattle to scare barren, did you?\"\n I could see her working through the insult, and when it finally sank in, she curled her lip and spat at me. Literally. I had to jump aside to avoid being hit.\n \"Such ladylike manners,\" I scolded, glancing over her shoulder. Roxy and Christian were strolling toward us, but upon sighting Tanya, Roxy took off like a gazelle, Christian following at a more decorous pace. \"Spitting, brawling in public, kicking people down the stairs... tsk, tsk. Whatever will be next? Picking your nose? Scratching your crotch in public?\"\n Arielle hurried around the table and grabbed her sister\u0027s arm. She said something to her in a low, intense voice. It didn\u0027t seem to have much effect on her, though, because Tanya pushed her away and faced me with clenched hands and blazing eyes. Arielle took one look at those eyes and hustled off. I just hoped it was to find help, and was not ashamed to admit I prayed it came in the form of a six-foot-four man with wicked amber eyes.\n \"You are not welcome here.\"\n I pulled out my ticket stub and showed it to her. \"This says I am.\"\n \"You try my patience once too often, connasse.\"\n My French wasn\u0027t terribly good, but even I knew what that word meant, and it wasn\u0027t in the least bit complimentary. My smile frayed a bit around the edges, but gamely I held on to it. I\u0027d be damned if I let her drag me into another scene. Once she realized she wouldn\u0027t get a response from me, I was sure she\u0027d leave.\n \"You think you are safe from me, but you are not. Dominic\u0027s protection of you will be withdrawn as soon as he has seen you as I have, and as for the other you attempt to arouse\" - she tossed her head and snapped her fingers - \"he is nothing, a stupid man hired to keep people like you away from us.\"\n \"Whatever,\" I pretended to yawn as Roxy dashed up to us, Christian on her heels. \"Much as I appreciate you painting me as some sort of femme fatale bent on seducing every man she sees, the truth is I\u0027m not trying to arouse anyone. I\u0027m just here to see the fair with my friends.\"\n \"Yeah,\" Roxy confirmed. \"We\u0027re just here to see the fair, not arouse anyone, although that\u0027s not entirely out of the question if it was the right person.\"\n \"You\u0027re not helping matters,\" I hissed to her. \"If you\u0027ll excuse us, Tanya, we\u0027ll just be on our merry way.\"\n \"You push and push your way to his attention,\" she snarled at me, stepping to the side to block my exit, \"but this I tell you - none of your tricks will work. I will cast a protection spell for Dominic to keep him safe from you.\"\n Fine. She wanted to snap and snarl, she could do it by herself.\n \"Have fun at the dungeon, did you?\" I ignored the furious woman in front of me to ask Roxy.\n \"Loads. Christian wanted to buy some fur-lined handcuffs, but I told him that was just gross.\"\n \"The handcuffs?\"\n \"The fur.\"\n I looked at Christian with speculation in my eye. He gave me one of his warm smiles in return. \"I thought it might add an unexpected depth to certain experiences.\"\n Who would have thought? I was about to mull on the deep waters that stirred Christian, but it was brought to my attention that Tanya didn\u0027t like being ignored.\n \"You will not turn away from me! You will not brush me off like the stinging bee!\" She gave me a shove in my shoulder as she spoke. Roxy whistled low and grabbed my arm. I bit back the desire to kick Tanya in the shins, determined not to let her get to me.\n \"I will speak and you will listen. Your plan to push yourself into the fair as a reader of the rune stones will fail. You do not have the skill, no matter how big you make yourself appear.\"\n I frowned over that puzzling sentence until I shrugged it off, figuring that not only was Tanya obsessed with Dominic and paranoid about me having whatever plan she was convinced I was plotting, she also was losing her grasp on English the angrier she became.\n \"You are nothing, you are insignificant to Dominic! You will not succeed.\"\n I tried to walk away, I really did. I smiled, said, \"You\u0027re repeating yourself. It\u0027s been lovely talking to you, Tanya, really it has, and don\u0027t let anyone convince you otherwise,\" and took Roxy by the arm and tried to walk away, but Tanya wouldn\u0027t let me.\n \"Salope!\" she sneered after me, proving that if nothing else, she had an excellent grasp of gutter French. \"Crawl away, that is good. Your weak attempt to bring yourself to Dominic\u0027s attention has failed, for you have no talent for divination. Dominic seeks only those who have true abilities, not poseurs. Go back to your hotel and remember who has been victorious this night.\"\n \"Poseur? That\u0027s a bit ironic coming from you,\" I said slowly, turning back to Tanya. Roxy shouldered me aside, her eyes raging with indignation on my behalf. I grabbed the back of her jacket to keep her from tangling with the larger, meaner woman, but she just pulled away.\n \"Are you implying that my friend is making a play for Dominic? You\u0027re dead wrong, sister, if you are. She thinks he\u0027s a creep, a big old creep. And you know what? So do I! So you can just put that in your pipe and smoke it!\"\n \"Roxy, stop. Don\u0027t lower yourself to her level.\"\n \"You are just as bad as she is,\" Tanya snapped at Roxy, her hands fisted. \"You seek the favor of Dominic\u0027s eye as well, but you will not have it either. I will cast a spell against you both!\"\n Roxy made a disgusted noise and deliberately misunderstood Tanya. \"As if I wanted his eye! You\u0027re nutso, lady, you know that? And another thing - don\u0027t call my friend a poseur. She\u0027s very good at reading rune stones, something I\u0027m willing to bet you can\u0027t do. If you didn\u0027t have your head stuck so far up your butt, you\u0027d be down on your knees begging her to help you guys out.\"\n \"Roxy,\" I said uneasily. Christian appeared at my shoulder, his eyes narrowed as he watched Tanya with an intensity that made my skin itch.\n \"I would rather die than ask that vache to join the fair,\" she snarled.\n Cow? She called me a cow? Well! I searched my mind for French obscenities. The worst I could come up with was the phrase telling her that her speech was worse than that of a female fishmonger. I figured it would do in a pinch.\n \"Good! There\u0027s no way I would ever consider working alongside you,\" I said, moving forward and gently pushing Roxy aside. \"Not in this or any other lifetime.\"\n \"La putain de ta m¨¨re,\" she hurled at me.\n \"Right back atcha, babe!\" I answered, incensed enough by her continuing attack on me, not to mention the slur on my mother, to go a few rounds with her.\n \"Do you both plan to make your arguments a regular part of the evening\u0027s entertainment?\" a voice asked from behind me. \"If so, I wish you\u0027d tell me. I have a slot before the magic show and after the poetry reading that might suit. Perhaps we could even add wagering on the outcome.\"\n Arielle was directly behind Raphael as he rounded the corner of the tent at a fast walk. My heart did an unpleasant little flip-flop when I spotted him, much like a fish does when it\u0027s been yanked from the water. A sudden overwhelming need washed over me, making me want to stand close to him, to smell him, to slide my hands under his shirt and over the planes of his chest. It seemed so very important that I touch him, I actually took two steps toward him before I reminded myself that there were far more important things than my unseemly desires.\n What, I couldn\u0027t remember, but I felt sure there was something more important.\n Tanya turned to Raphael and went off in a flurry of a language I didn\u0027t know, pointing at me and no doubt vilifying me, my ancestors, and probably my descendants as well. I caught his eye and gave him a mildly apologetic \"What could I do, I was just standing here and she walked up and started the fight, I am truly innocent of all things\" smile. He quirked a brow, his eyes turning hot and seductive and mesmerizing, and once again I felt the need to touch him, to do any number of things that I was quite sure would raise his eyebrows - among other things - again and again.\n \"That\u0027s enough,\" Raphael ordered, holding up his hand to cut off the flow of Tanya\u0027s poison. \"You are beginning to attract attention, and I doubt if it\u0027s the kind Dominic would be pleased to see you soliciting. Why aren\u0027t you at your booth?\"\n \"She ran out of bats\u0027 testicles and hares\u0027 anuses,\" I piped up. A corner of his mouth twitched and my knees melted in response. I was just about to damn restraint and fling myself upon him when it suddenly occurred to me that he was cheating. He was pulling mind tricks on me, getting me all hot and bothered via long distance, seducing me with his vampire ability to merge his mind with mine, and dammit, I wasn\u0027t going to stand for that! I might have accepted the fact that the only guy who suited me was a soulless undead who lived in darkness and indulged in unorthodox beverage choices, but I\u0027d be damned if I\u0027d just let him waltz into my mind and make it look like I was the one with hot pants! No sir! If he wanted to seduce me, he\u0027d have to do it the old fashioned way.\n \"Is it anuses or ani?\" Roxy asked in an aside, looking perplexed. \"You say octopi, don\u0027t you? Shouldn\u0027t more than one hare\u0027s anus be ani?\"\n \"I ran out of nothing!\" Tanya was saying. \"I thought to check on Arielle, and found this evil one with her, puffing herself up like a stoat over the runes.\"\n \"That\u0027s a very good question,\" I answered Roxy, greatly enjoying the furious looks Tanya blasted at both of us. I turned to Christian. \"Which do you favor, anuses or ani?\"\n He opened his mouth to answer, but Tanya cut him off with a shriek that could have curdled milk. \"You mock me! You see how she mocks me? This I will not stand for! I insist that you remove her from the grounds immediately!\"\n \"No,\" Raphael said, his eyes narrowed as he pinned her back with a hard, uncompromising look. \"I suggest you return to your booth, and make an effort not to speak to her again.\" I shot Tanya a smug look until he turned the same look on me. \"And you could help matters if you were to stay away from those members of the fair who seem to have a grudge against you.\"\n \"Perhaps it would be wise if we were to move on to the next attraction,\" Christian suggested, but before we could move, we were stopped by a polished voice.\n \"A grudge? Someone has a grudge against mon ange? This I cannot believe. Who could wish ill for Joy who has captured my heart?\"\n I rolled my eyes as Dominic oozed his way between Christian and Roxy, pausing to give the latter a quick fangy grin. A smaller dark-haired man with the flattest, most expressionless gray eyes I\u0027d ever seen followed him. I gave him the once-over, wondering who he was until he turned those creepy serial-killer eyes on me.\n \"Dominic!\" Tanya grabbed Dominic\u0027s arm and stared at him with eyes so bleak with pain, I wanted to flinch. \"How can you abuse me so? How can you say such things in front of that vache?\"\n \"You know,\" I said to no one in particular, \"I\u0027m really getting tired of being called a cow.\"\n Raphael raised both eyebrows, giving me a look that could steam the wrinkles out of a prune. I contemplated ripping off all his clothes and molesting him on the spot before I remembered that such an act was sure to be an idea he planted in my head, not one of my own. I glared at him instead.\n \"You are angry with me,\" Tanya continued as if I hadn\u0027t spoken. \"You cannot mean what you say. I will forgive you this once, but you must not allow yourself to be influenced by her attempts to arouse your interest.\"\n Arouse - oh yes, what a very nice word that was. I looked at Raphael. He looked back at me. Several parts of me that weren\u0027t on public display brought out their pompoms and began cheering.\n \"I begin to find you tedious, ma petite,\" Dominic told Tanya as he peeled her hand off his arm. He turned to his companion. \"As I have no further use for her, she is yours if you want her, Milos.\"\n So that was Dominic\u0027s missing partner? I filed away that fact as I took a step toward Raphael. His muscles bunched as if he wanted to move closer to me, but he wouldn\u0027t allow himself. I grabbed my hips and ordered my legs to stop listening to his silent siren call.\n \"Are you all right?\" Christian asked in a low tone that felt like warm velvet brushing against my skin.\n \"Fine,\" I whispered back. \"I\u0027m just having a bit of a control issue with a vampire trying to get me into his pants. Nothing to worry about.\"\n He looked startled. I smiled in reassurance.\n \"I do not take any man\u0027s leavings, my brother, not even yours.\" Milos looked over Tanya with an implacable face. \"I doubt she would sufficiently interest me.\"\n \"Connard!\" Tanya spat at him, and threw herself on Dominic. Milos didn\u0027t look at all fazed by her opinion on the marital status of his parents. In fact, he didn\u0027t look anything, not even bored. He was the most unexpressive, controlled person I\u0027d ever seen. Raphael might put on an impassive face now and again, but I knew that it was just a mask covering a seething river of emotion. Unbidden, my gaze wandered back to admire his profile.\n \"What\u0027s wrong?\" Roxy hissed in my ear. \"You look funny all of a sudden.\"\n \"It\u0027s Raphael,\" I whispered back. \"He\u0027s doing something to me. Something with his mind. He\u0027s evil.\"\n Her eyes got big.\n \"Do not punish me this way,\" Tanya cried to Dominic, clinging to his cape. He snarled at her in another language and tugged his cape from her grasp.\n \"You mean he\u0027s merging with you? Right now? This instant?\" Roxy whispered her question, one eye on the unfolding scene between the two men and Tanya, the other on Raphael. \"What\u0027s he doing?\"\n I yanked my gaze away from Raphael, determined not to allow him to sway my mind without my permission, instead focusing my attention on Tanya\u0027s anguished face. Even knowing she\u0027d tried to do me serious injury by kicking me on the stairs, I couldn\u0027t help but feel a twinge of sympathy for the horrible manner in which Dominic was treating her. It was a very small twinge, however.\n \"What is it you are whispering about?\" Christian leaned in to ask us.\n \"It\u0027s Joy. Her Dark One is doing something to her mind.\"\n \"Really?\" he asked, examining my face. \"She doesn\u0027t look any different. What is the vampire doing to her?\"\n \"It is all her fault!\" Tanya screeched, mindless of the attention she was drawing to our little group. She spun around and pointed at me dramatically. \"She has cast a spell upon you! You are doomed to fall under it unless I can reverse it. I, alone, have the power to save you from her!\"\n I waggled my fingers at her. \"Boogedy-boogedy-boo!\"\n She turned red with fury.\n \"She\u0027s having visions like before, aren\u0027t you, Joy?\" Roxy tugged at my sleeve, dragging my attention back to her.\n \"No, it\u0027s not like the visions,\" I whispered out the side of my mouth, too embarrassed to admit that Raphael could have such an effect on me with just a few lewd thoughts planted in my head.\n \"Ma petite, you go too far. Mon ange has not the evil presence in her soul. It takes one who knows evil to cast spells.\"\n \"You\u0027re not helping calm her down,\" Raphael told him at the same time I commented, \"Ooooh, low blow, Dominic!\"\n Dominic just smiled at me and made a corny bow.\n Raphael shook his head, raising his hands in defeat as he took a couple of steps toward me. I switched my attention to him, smiling victoriously as he moved closer. Two could play at this little mind-seduction game. I\u0027d been willing him to come to me, and now he was.\n \"Then what is it he\u0027s doing?\" Roxy whispered in my ear, so low I almost couldn\u0027t hear her over the shrieks of anger Tanya was emitting at regular intervals as she lambasted Dominic for his nasty comment. \"Joy? What\u0027s Raphael doing to you?\"\n \"Seducing me,\" I answered, taking a step forward and letting my eyes go all soft at Raphael. I thought he needed a little reward for giving in and coming to me once he realized I had an iron will that couldn\u0027t be swayed by a little mind-seduction. His amber eyes opened wide in response. I took a deep breath and inhaled that lovely Raphael scent that wrapped around him. The cheerleading team in my nether parts kicked into overdrive.\n Raphael, with one last look at me that I was sure would turn all the bones in my body to oatmeal, turned back to Dominic. Tanya was on her knees before him, pleading with him to listen to her.\n \"If having a nightly catfight is a new attraction,\" Raphael told him, \"you really should consider charging more for admittance.\" He nodded toward the people gathering behind Dominic and Milos. I turned to grab Roxy and Christian and make an escape while we could, but Christian had disappeared.\n Dominic stiffened and gave Raphael one of his pseudo-haughty stares. \"You will not speak about mon ange in that manner.\"\n \"Will you give it up?\" I frowned at Dominic, interrupting the reply Raphael was about to make. \"I\u0027m not an angel, and I\u0027m certainly not your angel. If I\u0027m anyone\u0027s angel, I\u0027m his.\" Of its own accord, my finger pointed at Raphael. I clapped a hand over my mouth a fraction of a second after the words left my lips. Raphael\u0027s eyebrows raised in an expression of sheer, unadulterated surprise.\n \"You\u0027re not playing fair!\" I accused him. \"You made me say that! You\u0027re making everyone think I\u0027m the one who\u0027s wild about you! I\u0027ll thank you to stay out of my mind, and stop seducing me!\"\n \"Seducing you?\" he asked, ignoring Dominic as he frowned at me. \"I am seducing you?\"\n \"Yes, you are, and you needn\u0027t try to look so innocent, we both know who you are and what you\u0027re doing, so you can just wipe that \u0027I haven\u0027t the slightest clue what you\u0027re going on about\u0027 look off your face, and keep your mind to yourself! If you want me in your bed, you\u0027re going to have to do it properly, you got that?\"\n \"Certainly. Perhaps you could tell me when and how you would prefer I seduce you? I would hate to catch you unaware at an inopportune time, or go about it in a manner that did not meet with your express approval.\"\n \"Mon ange.\" Dominic separated himself from Tanya, taking my hand before I could stop him. \"You are distressed and speaking in the heat of passion. What is this Tanya is babbling about rune stones?\" He turned my hand over and pressed a red-lipped kiss to my palm. I made a fist.\n \"You want a knuckle sandwich, buster, just keep it up.\"\n Dominic laughed and turned to Milos. \"She is delightful, is she not? Do you not envy me my good fortune in finding her?\"\n \"Oh, for God\u0027s sake, I\u0027m going to plant one on him... \" I thought about taking a swing at him, but decided I wouldn\u0027t just a nanosecond before Raphael grabbed my hand, my entire fist wrapped firmly in his. I shivered at the touch and tried to keep the cheerleading squad in my womanly parts from breaking out into back flips.\n \"She has spirit. She will be an excellent consort for me,\" Dominic continued, one hand holding Tanya down as she flailed at his feet, beating on his legs and screaming obscenities.\n \"That\u0027s not spirit, it\u0027s just gas,\" Roxy spoke up, her arms crossed. I glared at her. There were times when I really didn\u0027t need her help. \"Which, if you think about it, is a rather fitting comment on her opinion of you, don\u0027t you think?\"\n \"You will read the runes for me,\" Dominic said, releasing my hand when I jerked it hard enough to make him stagger forward a few steps. \"No, no.\" He held up his hands when he saw me about to protest. \"You must. Did you not hear Tanya? She has challenged you. You must avenge the insults she has made against your honor.\"\n I grabbed Roxy by the arm. \"Thanks, but no thanks. We\u0027ll be on our way now. I\u0027ll see you later,\" I said meaningfully to Raphael as I dragged Roxy past him.\n He blinked. \"Will you?\"\n Dominic called something out to me. Tanya shrieked in response. I ignored both of them to stare into the loveliest eyes I\u0027d ever seen. \"I assume so. We have unfinished business, don\u0027t we?\"\n He looked at my lips. I suddenly found myself wanting to lick his.\n \"Yes,\" he replied, his eyes going molten. My breath caught in my throat as he reached out and brushed a strand of hair where it had flown across my cheek. \"I believe we do have unfinished business.\"\n \"Good,\" I gulped, suddenly one big mass of tingling body parts that wanted an immediate introduction to all of his body parts. I tried to slam down a mental barrier between his mind and mine, but it did no good. The cheerleaders in my groin were setting up fundraising car washes to finance a field trip to his groin.\n \"Hey! I don\u0027t want to leave yet! Just because you\u0027ve got a witch all mad at you and a weirdo claiming you for his consort, not to mention a vampire just waiting to sink his fangs into you, doesn\u0027t mean I have to go back to the hotel room and twiddle my thumbs. I want to be where the action is!\"\n I released Roxy\u0027s coat. \"No problem. You might go find Christian and apologize for how the evening turned out. Poor guy must think everyone around here is a lunatic.\"\n \"I\u0027m sure he\u0027s in no doubt that some people are, at least,\" Raphael muttered. I squinted my eyes at him just in case he was talking about me. Was that any way for a Dark One to speak of his Beloved?\n \"Later.\" I nodded to him.\n He made a slight bow to me, his rugged, manly lips quirked in an odd little smile.\n I ignored Dominic\u0027s demand to stay where I was, and skipped off into the night. When I looked back, Raphael had a hold of Dominic, and was speaking vehemently in his ear.\n I raced back to the hotel, in a bit of a swivet because of the dark promise Raphael had let me see in his eyes. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-girl-s-guide-to-vampires-dark-ones-1/page-7.html","bookId":2190,"book":{"id":2190,"title":"A Girl\u0027s Guide to Vampires (Dark Ones #1)","description":"Storyline: \n A Girl\u0027s Guide to Vampires (Dark Ones #1) \n All Joy Randall wants is a little old-fashioned romance, but when she participates in a \"Goddess evoking\" ceremony with her friend, Roxy, Joy finds out her future true love is a man with the potential to put her immortal soul in danger.
