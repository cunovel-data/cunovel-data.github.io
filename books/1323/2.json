{"id":39127,"no":2,"title":"CHAPTER II. GENERAL MARION.","content":"Not until I had warned him, was Percy aware of the danger which menaced. Intent only upon the task which he set himself, with a view of performing it in the shortest possible space of time, the lad gave no heed to anything else, and but for the fact of my being on watch, so to speak, I believe of a verity he would have been taken prisoner. Even as it was, he did not cease his labors until the Tory crew were come within fifty yards of him, and then with one vigorous, well-directed blow by way of parting, Percy took to his heels. I had at that moment started toward him, believing the lad was minded to give battle even though the odds were [25] twenty to one, for the James family of Williamsburg are not given to counting cost when the chances are heavily against them. Then, seeing what was his inclination, I wheeled about almost at the very instant when the Tories sent a volley of bullets after us, and I do truly believe there was a blush of shame upon my cheek that men of Carolina should show themselves such wretched marksmen, for not a missile hit us, although the range could not have been above forty yards. We were not minded to run in the open where the traitors might practise at shooting, with us as targets; but, bearing sharply to the left, we plunged into the thicket, where I felt certain such as those who would consort with Sam Lee could not come up with us. Percy, whose blood had been warmed by the punishment given the young Tory, burned with a desire to halt and give battle. [26] \"It would be folly for us to set ourselves against such odds when no benefit may be derived from the battle,\" I said, speaking as we ran. \"If the odds are great, so much more thorough the lesson, and these skulking traitors surely need a check just now, when the fortunes of war seem to be in their favor.\" \"Ay, but it is not for us to play the schoolmaster with less than half a horn of powder and five bullets,\" I replied, checking back the mirth which came upon me when the dear lad spoke of making an attack almost empty-handed upon the Tories of Williamsburg. It was such a suggestion as might be expected from a James of the Carolinas, and certain it is Percy would have halted with a smile upon his face and a sense of deepest satisfaction in his heart, even though by so doing we brought ourselves face to face with death. He always looked upon me as a leader, [27] however, and now it was well he had been accustomed to do so, otherwise I doubt if we should ever have left that place alive. \"Since we must perforce return empty-handed, for there are no other mills to be sacked in this neighborhood, I would give much for the privilege of showing those fellows how to shoot, else will this day be wasted,\" he said after a pause. \"In that you are making a mistake, lad. The day would surely be spent in vain if yonder band of Tories suffer no greater loss of numbers than we could inflict; but by running away now it may be possible to crush out the whole nest.\" \"Then you have some plan in mind?\" he cried eagerly. \"No more than this: After the reverses which have come to our people at Charleston something in the nature of success is necessary to revive the faint-hearted, and it can readily be done if we carry to General Marion word of what has been done. Unless I am much mistaken in our commander, [28] we shall soon have ample opportunity of showing these traitors how to shoot.\" Now, and for the first time, Percy understood what might be the result of this day\u0027s failure, so far as we were concerned, to secure material for sabres. It was no longer necessary for me to urge him to make greater speed in the retreat. Halting only when forced to do so that we might regain breath, and giving no thought whatsoever to fatigue, the race was ended in a little more than two hours, when we stood before our uncle, the major, telling him of what we had seen at Pingree\u0027s Mill. \"It is a fortunate chance for us, lads,\" he said in a tone of satisfaction. \"Scantily equipped as this force is, we need something to inflame the courage of our men.\" \"Sam Lee would have had us believe there were two thousand Tories nearabout, sir,\" I ventured to suggest, and the major looked at me searchingly for an instant. [29] \"Do the odds make you timorous, lad?\" \"Not so, sir. But that I believed it necessary General Marion should know of the encampment, Percy and I would have given them so much of a lesson as might be possible with five bullets. In fact, I found it somewhat difficult to force him along with me, so much averse was he to running away.\" My uncle\u0027s stern, questioning gaze disappeared on the instant, and gripping both of us lads by the hands, he said in a most friendly tone: \"I had no reason whatsoever to question your courage, for you are members of our family; yet for the merest fraction of time it seemed as if you might perchance show the white feather when our enemies were in such force. Come with me to the general, and you shall see whether any account be taken of numbers, for now has the Cause fallen into such sore straits that every man who holds to it must consider himself equal to a dozen of the king\u0027s minions.\" [30] Our brigade was set down, rather than encamped, in the woods; there were no shelters other than such as the men made for themselves with pine boughs, and the command bore but little semblance to a military organization. Therefore it was that we were not troubled to gain audience with the commander. The crimson jacket could be seen a long distance away under a huge live-oak tree, nearby where were three or four men building a camp-fire, and toward that gleaming spot of color we made our way. \"I would introduce to you two members of my family, sons of the Widow Sumter,\" the major said as he saluted, and I was surprised at the change which passed over that serious, almost gloomy-looking face when a friendly expression came into his eyes. It was as if he had thrown off the mask, and shown us a countenance almost the opposite to that which we had previously seen. [31] Nothing more was needed to tell me, that now indeed, we had a leader who was worthy to supersede my uncle. \"It pleasures me to meet with those who are akin to such a true patriot as Major James,\" the general said most courteously, and one needs remember that he was speaking to two lads, in order to understand how much such words meant. \"I can answer for it they will be true to any trust you may repose in them,\" my uncle said, and Percy gripped me by the hand that I might understand how well pleased he was at such words of praise. \"It was not simply to bring the lads to your notice that I have thus introduced them, General; they have information of greatest importance.\" General Marion turned toward us inquiringly, and in as few words as might be I told him of the encounter. \"A force of two thousand?\" he said half to himself, and added as he looked me full in the eye. \"Can you depend upon the [32] truthfulness of the lad who made the boast?\" \"Indeed we cannot, sir. I would have been inclined to doubt the entire story, had not forty or more appeared in response to Sam Lee\u0027s cries for help.\" \"Are you positive he spoke of Major Gainey as being in command?\" \"Ay, sir; I remember well the name.\" \"Are you lads enlisted with this force?\" Instead of answering the question I looked toward my uncle, and he replied without hesitation: \"They are, General, if it please you to accept lads as young as they.\" \"It is the will and the courage, rather than the age, which we need, Major James, and unless I have made a mistake in reading their faces, these sons of the Widow Sumter may do men\u0027s work in the task which is set them.\" Percy and I made our best salute, as can well be fancied and from that moment counted ourselves as being enlisted under [33] that true general and valiant soldier, to whom the butcher Tarleton gave the name of \"Swamp Fox.\" The general, having acknowledged our salute, turned toward my uncle in such manner as gave us to understand that he wished to speak with him privately, and we withdrew a short distance, to where Gavin Witherspoon, an old acquaintance, was making ready for the eating a string of fish. \"Are you two lads come to see how soldiers live?\" the old man asked with that peculiar grin which had earned for him the name of the \"big mouthed.\" \"If we had, it would seem that we were come to the wrong place,\" Percy replied with a laugh. \"Surely you are not counting yourself a soldier, Gavin Witherspoon?\" \"I am allowin\u0027 I\u0027ll come as nigh to it as many who wear the king\u0027s uniform. It isn\u0027t always him who stands the stiffest that can bring down the most game, an\u0027 [34] there\u0027s no need of my tellin\u0027 two lads by the name of Sumter that we of Williamsburg are not given to wastin\u0027 ammunition.\" \"Of that I am not so certain,\" Percy retorted, \"for within the past three hours, forty, who might perhaps claim this district as their home, had fair shot at us, and within fifty-yard range, therefore you can see for yourself whether the ammunition was wasted or not.\" \"Forty?\" Gavin cried excitedly, forgetting for the instant his camp duties at this mention of the enemy. I was not minded to keep the old man in suspense, therefore at once told him of what we had seen, whereupon he ceased his labors as cook and began overhauling the long, smooth-bore rifle, in the use of which he might truly be called an expert. \"Are you going out single-handed in search of them?\" Percy asked banteringly. \"Hark you, lads! I served under General [35] Marion in \u002775, when he was only a captain, and know full well what manner of man he is. Neither he nor Major James would remain here idle after such a story as you have brought, and I venture to say this mess of fish won\u0027t be needed until they are past cookin\u0027.\" Gavin Witherspoon had no more than spoken, before we heard the word passed from man to man around the encampment that an immediate advance was to be made. Now to the credit of the men of Williamsburg, let me set down this fact, that without the least show of hesitation, although it was understood the enemy which we had reported far outnumbered us, every member of the brigade set about his preparations for the journey with apparently as much pleasure as if bent on some merry-making. We were not well supplied with provisions, yet there were others than Gavin Witherspoon who left the food by the fires, [36] lest perchance they should be among the last who were ready. I think no more than twenty minutes passed from the time of our arrival until everything was in readiness—every man mounted, except the commanding officers, and Percy said to me mournfully: \"It is like to benefit us but little, this having been enlisted under General Marion, for how may we keep pace with the horsemen?\" I had asked myself that question, and decided that on this expedition, which rightfully belonged to us because of the discovery, we must perforce be left behind. \"All appear to have forgotten us; even Gavin Witherspoon no longer looks our way,\" Percy continued, and it was then that our uncle called us by name. It can well be imagined that we lost no time in obeying the summons, and, approaching to where he was standing in company with the general and a captain, we heard that which gave us much pleasure. [37] \"Captain Mouzon has generously offered you lads a mount. His spare horses are to be found back here in the thicket, under care of the servants,\" my uncle said. \"You will overtake us as soon as may be, and report at once to me. The general has been pleased to detail you for special duty.\" While speaking he mounted his horse, the others doing the same, and as Percy and I hurried away the word was given for the command to advance. Even at the expense of telling over-much that may seem like dry reading, I must make especial mention of the advantage we had over the enemy, in the way of horses. The Carolinians dearly loved a thoroughbred, and in Williamsburg district every soldier was mounted in kingly fashion. The heavy, lumbering work-horses which were sold to the redcoats, were like snails compared with the blooded stock our people rode, and because of these did General Marion owe much of his success in the days to come, when we dashed here and there over [38] the country, striking a blow at night twenty miles or more away from where we had hurled ourselves upon the foe in the morning. Now we two lads knew that Captain Mouzon had in his stables not less than thirty beasts which had no superiors in the neighborhood, and therefore were we positive of being astride such as would carry us well in the advance, however mad might be the pace set. We found old Jacob, the captain\u0027s chief groom, in charge of four clean-limbed, noble beasts as ever wore a saddle, and it was not an easy matter to persuade him we had authority to select such as we chose, for he claimed that until a lad had had much experience in the hunting field, he was not to be trusted with a choice of mounts. Threats would have availed us but little, for despite the old fellow\u0027s dark skin, he had a brave heart when the welfare of his stable was at stake, and therefore we spoke him fairly, using soft words rather than [39] harsh, until, coming to believe we were but repeating the words of his master, he saddled the horses we had selected. Bestride such animals as could not well be excelled in the Carolinas, Percy and I set forth in pursuit of our friends, confident that we would be able to give a good account of ourselves, although sadly lacking an outfit. \"Unless it so be we can borrow powder and ball, I fear our share in the punishment of the Tories will be slight indeed,\" my brother said mournfully, and I laughed at his gloomy face. \"Two hours ago, when we were hastening back from Pingree\u0027s Mill, you would have said that with steeds like these we should be equipped in most kingly fashion, and now that we have under us the choice of Captain Mouzon\u0027s stud, you find yet further necessities.\" \"I leave it to you to say if five bullets and half a horn of powder make any very formidable outfit under such leaders as [40] General Marion and our uncle, the major, both of whom are like to show a greediness for fighting?\" It was a matter which could not be remedied, this lack of ammunition, until we were come up with some acquaintance who had a larger store than he needed, and such an one might be difficult to find in the district of Williamsburg, for we who held to the Cause were poor in everything save the desire to aid our country. That exhilaration which comes with the stride of a horse when one is in the saddle was upon me, and, for the time being, I gave little heed to our necessities, save that I remembered with regret the fish Gavin Witherspoon had wasted. After a tramp of twenty miles Percy and I stood in need of food, and but for our own foolhardiness we might have eaten our fill from the different messes which the men left behind, instantly the word was given that the enemy were in such position as invited attack. [41] When we were come up with the command, Major James beckoned for us to join the general and himself, and then it was we learned what work had been cut out for us. \"It is my desire,\" General Marion said as if speaking to comrades, \"that you two lads seek out the haunts of the Tories in this vicinity, and do not let it be known you are enlisted with us. While our numbers are few, the blows must be quick and frequent, therefore it is necessary we have constantly in advance searchers, or scouts, whichever you may choose to call them.\" \"Are we to bear no share in the fighting, sir?\" I ventured to ask, and a great disappointment came into my heart that we were to be of so little service. \"No more than absolutely necessary. You can serve the Cause to better purpose otherwise, for two lads like yourselves are less liable to suspicion when venturing in the enemy\u0027s country.\" \"Any who know us as members of the [42] James family will understand full well that we have no sympathy with the Tories,\" Percy cried, whereat the general laughed heartily as, turning to the major, he said: \"The ties of kinship are drawn more closely in the Carolinas than elsewhere in all the world, I believe, and well it should be so.\" Then he added, looking directly at me. \"We shall stir up the nest which you two found, and perhaps give you a share of the fighting, but only because Britton\u0027s Neck is, from this point, on the direct road to another quarter I would have you visit. You may, if you please, join us in the first attack, and then I shall expect you to ride toward Indian Village, where I have reason to believe certain enemies under one Captain Barfield may be found. You will gain so much of information as is possible, and report to me somewhere on the east bank of Cedar Creek.\" So that we were to join in this first attack I gave little thought for the future, [43] and said to myself that if we proved our metal in one case we might find further opportunities. The general dismissed us with a friendly nod, and we rode down the line, hoping to find some friend who would loan us powder and ball. In this last quest we were so far successful as to obtain, perhaps, sufficient for five charges more, and then we had even a larger store than many a man who rode with the brigade. It was within an hour of sunset when we set out for Britton\u0027s Neck, on the first ride Percy and I had ever undertaken for the Cause, and it would please me much to repeat all the incidents of that night\u0027s journey, for they are so deeply impressed upon my memory as never to be effaced by whatsoever of adventure may come to me later in life. It is not well that I devote so much space, however, to what others may think uninteresting, and, therefore, acting on Percy\u0027s [44] advice, I shall say no more concerning the journey when our brigade, only four companies strong, rode through the silent hours of the night at a slow trot, eager to measure strength with an enemy known to be several times greater in numbers than we could muster. The gray light of the early dawn was just becoming tinged with that yellow tint which betokens the near approach of the sun, when at a signal from Major James we came to a halt. Not until that moment could I see any signs of the enemy, and then, gazing in the direction indicated by General Marion\u0027s outstretched hand, I saw dimly amid the mist the outlines of an encampment so large, that for the moment I had no question but what Sam Lee told us only the truth when he said the force of Tories to be full two thousand. It may have been one minute or ten that we remained there, horses and men silent, and motionless as statues; so great was [45] my excitement that I could not count the passage of time. Only this do I know, that it seemed as if we wasted all that early time of morning twilight before the signal was given. Then it was my uncle raised his hat, waving it above his head at the instant he gave rein to his horse, and so eager were our men to be at the throats of the enemy, that before the major\u0027s steed had fairly made the first bound, every member of the brigade was riding forward in mad haste. The onward rush of that body of horsemen must have presented a singular spectacle, had any one been near at hand to look at it calmly. In the gray light four hundred or more men riding at full speed in perfect silence, save for the thud of the horses\u0027 feet upon the sward, and with them in their very midst, thanks to the fleetness of Captain Mouzon\u0027s steeds, were Percy and I. My one thought was that to prove myself a worthy follower of such a commander, [46] I must in this attack appear the equal of any man in the ranks, and, having such aim in view, I urged the willing steed forward. Percy was not minded to be left behind when there was a chance one might be accused of timorousness, and side by side we rode as if on a wager, soon outstripping all save two who were leading the advance. These two were the major, our uncle, and Captain Mouzon, owner of the horses we bestrode. We four were well up to the edge of the encampment by the time I understood we were comparatively alone, and not until then, when the first word was spoken, did I fully realize the situation. \"The Mouzon stables lead!\" the captain cried triumphantly, thinking even at that moment of peril more about his horses than himself. \"But the tribe of James are riding them!\" the major shouted, and then, as if [47] he had come up through the earth, a Tory horseman appeared directly in front of us. Two pistols were discharged almost in our very faces—so near that the mane of my horse was singed by the fire, and then this particular enemy was in full retreat. \"It is Major Gainey!\" our leader shouted as he struck the spurs into his steed, and before one had time to realize anything more we four were in the very midst of the Tory band, while around us, forming a circle of fire, were the flashes of burning powder.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1488/44526.html","bookId":1323,"book":{"id":1323,"title":"With the Swamp Fox","description":"简介： He who sets himself down to write of his own deeds in order that future generations may know exactly what part he bore in freeing the colonies from the burdens put upon them by a wicked king, must have some other excuse, or reason, than that of self-...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1488","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:51 AM"}}
