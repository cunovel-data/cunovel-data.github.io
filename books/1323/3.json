THE TORY CAMP.","content":"It was the first time Percy and I had ever taken part in a deadly encounter, and, perchance, had there been opportunity for us to consider the situation, one or both might have shown the white feather. \n \n As it was, however, and I have since noted the fact on every similar occasion, there was no opportunity for fear; the fever of excitement was upon us; the odor of burned powder mounted to one\u0027s brain, as it were, and we became more like brutes than human beings. \n \n There was to me a certain sense of satisfaction in the danger; a savage delight in shooting, with intent to kill, at the enemies of our country, and above all, the knowledge [49] that we were proving ourselves worthy a place in the James family. \n \n I saw Captain Mouzon\u0027s horse fall, and looked with a certain curiosity to see how he might extricate himself from the weight of the animal. \n \n I also wondered where Sam Lee might be, hoping it would be my good fortune to come upon him. Then suddenly, when my musket was empty, a redcoated Tory rushed toward me with upraised saber. \n \n I tried to ward off the blow with my gun, knowing full well that I could not hope to be successful in such an encounter, and then the man suddenly fell to the ground as if stricken by a bolt of lightning. \n \n It was Percy who had brought the Tory down, thus saving my life, and I heard him, as one hears from afar off, cry impatiently: \n \n \"My last charge of powder is gone!\" \n \n It is impossible for me to say, and I have pondered over the matter again and again, why it was that the scene suddenly [50] changed, or how we three—for now that Captain Mouzon was on foot he did not count as one of our squad—emerged from that tangle of men, and found ourselves in pursuit of the fleeing, panic-stricken enemy. I remember clearly that one moment it was as if we were entirely surrounded, and the next, all was clear before us, save for that blotch of red in the distance which we pursued at the full speed of our horses, Major James shouting now and again as if to give us lads courage: \n \n \"If it so be that we ride hard they cannot escape us! Spare not your horses, lads, and we shall soon clear Williamsburg district of the nest of vipers that should have been crushed out years ago!\" \n \n I was near to smiling, despite the fact that this was a race in which human life had been put at stake, because our uncle should suggest that we might take any part in wiping out the \"vipers,\" when our last charge of ammunition was expended, [51] and we carried no other arms than muskets. \n \n Yet did we press on at his heels with all the speed of which Captain Mouzon\u0027s steeds were capable, eager to gain the advance if that might be, lest he should for a single instant fancy we had grown faint-hearted. \n \n It was the first time we had had an opportunity of proving that the James blood ran in our veins, and had I been certain death awaited me at the end of that mad chase, I would have spurred my horse on yet faster, exulting in the thought that I might come to my end in such noble fashion as now, when following the lead of Major James! \n \n Percy shouted like one who is without sense, and yet there was no thought in my mind of chiding him, for I understood full well why it was that the sound of his own voice seemed necessary—it was but the natural vent of the excitement that had taken hold of him like as a fever, and I [52] have since been told that I also cried out unmeaning words; but yet was unconscious of having done so. \n \n Then suddenly the scene changed again, and with this transformation came into my heart what was very like fear. \n \n One moment it was as if we had the whole of General Marion\u0027s force at our heels, and the next we were alone, riding down into that mass of fleeing Tories who outnumbered us two hundred to one, while not a friend of the Cause could be seen in the rear. \n \n I saw Major James glancing over his shoulder, and involuntarily I copied the movement, although for thirty seconds or more had I known we were so far in the advance as to be practically cut off from our friends. \n \n There was no change of expression in my uncle\u0027s face when he realized that we were come into sore danger—for now we were well upon the heels of the enemy;—but he looked at me as if asking whether the [53] knowledge of our situation brought timorousness into my heart. \n \n I have ever been proud because at that instant I answered his inquiring look with such words as tickled his fancy mightily: \n \n \"There be three of us, Major, and more are not needed.\" \n \n It was the speech of a braggart, but yet under such circumstances the words gave my uncle more confidence in our courage than almost anything else could have done, and an expression, which for the moment I took to be affection, came over his face as he replied in a ringing tone: \n \n \"God bless the sister who gave to me such nephews!\" Then, waving his saber and shouting at the full strength of his lungs as if he had a thousand men behind him, he cried, \"Here they are, boys! Here they are! Come on!\" \n \n I believe of a verity that the Tories fancied he was calling to a large force, rather than to two lads who were practically [54] weaponless, for their panic increased, if that could be possible, and they crowded upon each other\u0027s heels until the advance was impeded. \n \n With fifty well-armed men at that time I venture to say we might have wiped out Major Gainey\u0027s entire force, and that officer himself was nigh to being taken prisoner when my uncle, spurring his horse into the very midst of the fugitives, singled out the leader as if challenging him to mortal combat. \n \n Major Gainey, although he was a Tory, had never been called a coward; but on this morning he absolutely refused the challenge, and instead of halting to meet the foe as he would have done had his cause been just, he forced aside the weaker of his following, and succeeded in making good an escape. \n \n \"It was shame enough that one from Williamsburg should be a Tory,\" my uncle cried, brandishing his saber in impotent rage; \"but that a Gainey would show himself [55] a coward as well, I have never believed until this hour.\" \n \n It was strange indeed that of all the enemy we pursued so hotly and so closely, none turned upon us. \n \n It would have been a simple task for a dozen of them, armed as we knew they were, to have allowed us to come into their midst, and then, closing, taken all three prisoners, or shot us down as might best have suited their fancy. \n \n The fever of fear, however, was upon them until there was no thought in the minds of any save of individual safety, and during ten minutes or more we rode upon the heels of that retreating rabble, taunting them with such words as should have turned the faintest-hearted at bay. \n \n There were seconds during that chase when I trembled with what was like unto a fear, realizing all which it was possible for them to do, and then that sensation would pass away while rage took possession of me because of my inability to do [56] other than lash the miserable Tories with my tongue. \n \n Then Major James wheeled suddenly about, for we had come to the edge of Pedee Swamp, and, by his gesture rather than words, we understood that it was our turn to retreat. \n \n The Tories were forced, because of the water, to ride more slowly, and should we still press upon them they must, even like rats, turn at bay; when, as a matter of course, the end would have come for us. \n \n We had shown them what a man could do whose cause was just, and it would have been folly to continue on to the useless sacrifice of our own lives. \n \n We turned about, as I have said, in obedience to my uncle\u0027s signal, and rode to the rear faster than we came, for now was there fear some of the cowardly foe might shoot us in the back, and before drawing rein we came upon General Marion and Captain M\u0027Cottry. \n \n These two were, like ourselves, far in [57] advance, and by reining in his horse the general forced us to halt. \n \n Now occurred that which I shall ever remember with the most intense pride and satisfaction so long as the breath remains in my body. \n \n He who was to be afterward so well-known as the \"Swamp Fox,\" he who was the bravest among all the brave men in the Carolinas, leaning forward in the saddle held out his hands, one to each of us lads, and said in a tone so hearty that there could be no mistaking the sentiment in his heart: \n \n \"I have ever believed the members of the James family to be true to their country, their friends, and to themselves; but never before had I expected to see two boys ride at their kinsman\u0027s call straight into what seemed certain danger. I am proud indeed that you were eager to seek service under my command, and promise that if my life be spared you shall have fitting opportunity to show your devotion to the Cause.\" [58] \n \n We lads were unable to speak because of the pride and pleasure which filled our hearts to overflowing; but my uncle, taking off his hat with more of homage than I had ever seen him bestow upon any other man, made reply: \n \n \"When General Marion is pleased to speak such words to members of my family, he places under obligation every one of us.\" \n \n \"There can be no sense of obligation, Major, when the praise has been won so handsomely.\" \n \n \"In that I agree with you, General, and more particularly because neither of my nephews had a charge of ammunition. After the first rush they followed bravely, although virtually weaponless, and I am happy to be able to call them my sister\u0027s sons. The ride is completed, and we now await your orders.\" \n \n \"Have all the force escaped?\" the general asked. \n \n \"Ay, sir, all save those who may have [59] been rendered unable to continue the retreat. They are in Pedee Swamp where it would be worse than folly to make any attempt at following them.\" \n \n The general wheeled his horse around, motioning Percy and I to ride by his side, and together we returned to where the main body of our brigade was halted. \n \n Here after a short time we learned that a captain and nine men had been killed from among the Tory force, while our loss amounted to only two wounded, and it was safe to say that many days would elapse before Major Gainey\u0027s regiment could be got into fighting shape again. \n \n There was no reason why any of us should longer suffer from hunger, for we were in possession of the Tory camp where were provisions in abundance, and during an hour we feasted, Percy and I, as only lads can who have been without food nigh on to four and twenty hours. \n \n Then, when believing it would be possible to return to our home for a short time—and [60] we were eager to tell our mother of the proud distinction we had won—word was brought by one of the troopers that General Marion would speak with us. \n \n I venture to say there was not a man in the brigade who did not envy us two lads as we went toward that portion of the thicket where the commander was seated under a live oak tree with his officers clustered about him, and I am also quite certain that of all the force, we two had the least right to be praised or singled out for preferment. \n \n Among those who served the Cause in the Carolinas there were no cowards; it appeared much as if the timorous ones turned Tories because, by professing to serve the king, a colonist is not required to bear so many hardships or encounter so many dangers, as those who would throw off his majesty\u0027s yoke. Therefore it was that when an officer like General Marion selected two from among all that gathering, it was indeed a great distinction, and [61] we understood by his sending for us that we were like to be called upon for an especial service, as he had already intimated. \n \n Although unused to such a life as we had so suddenly embarked upon, Percy and I contrived to salute the general in something approaching military fashion, and he, returning it, asked in the tone of a friend rather than of one who commands: \n \n \"Are you lads minded to set out on a venture which has in it much of danger?\" \n \n Percy looked at me as if to say that I should act as spokesman, and I replied more readily than perhaps was courteous, fearing lest it might be fancied we hesitated: \n \n \"Aye, sir; that we are, and the more of danger the more readily do we set out. I say this last not in a boasting manner, but to show you, sir, that we are right willing to lay down our lives for the good of the Cause which our uncle serves.\" \n \n \"It is well spoken, young sir. I had [62] no doubt of your willingness; but rather made mention of the danger that you might have an opportunity to draw back honorably, if it so be you shrank in any degree from the task, for it is one through which little honor can be gained, although the service must be performed.\" \n \n \"We are ready for whatsoever pleases you, sir,\" I said, and Percy laid his hand in mine that it might be understood he repeated the words. \n \n \"Between here and Dubose Ferry—the precise location you must yourselves determine—one Captain Barfield lies encamped, having under him a force not less than four hundred strong. Our purpose is to advance upon him immediately; but having learned that there is a possibility his men may far exceed ours in numbers, it is necessary we have full information before venturing an attack. Are you minded to seek him out, and learn all that may be ascertained within a few hours, returning to us before nightfall?\" [63] \n \n \"We will set out at once, sir. Captain Mouzon lent us horses that we might join in the march, and perhaps he will allow us to use them in this service,\" I said, turning toward the captain, who replied readily: \n \n \"That you may, lads, and in welcome. I am right glad that the Mouzon stables can furnish mounts for such riders as you have shown yourselves to be.\" \n \n \"Then we will set out at once, sir,\" I said to the general. \"The horses have already been cared for, and should be able to make the journey without distress.\" \n \n \"There is no time to be lost. You yourselves are to decide how the information we desire can best and most safely be obtained, for it would be unwise to hamper you with advice or commands. At about noon the brigade will set out at a slow pace in the direction of Dubose Ferry, and I hope you may be able to meet us several miles this side of the encampment. We shall ride so nearly as may be in a [64] straight line, and at about nightfall keep sharp watch for your approach. The most important information is as to the number of the enemy; then the general position of the camp, and, finally, how it may be best come upon.\" \n \n Having said this the general saluted, as did the officers round about him, and Percy and I, understanding that we were dismissed, would have moved away, but that the major, my uncle, stepped forward, taking us each by the hand. \n \n He spoke no word; but I understood that he was bidding us good-by, and his manner of doing it told me, had such information been necessary, how dangerous was the mission with which we were charged. \n \n Again the general and his officers saluted, and then we, turning on our heels, set about making ready for the departure. \n \n Some of the men lounging nearabout would have spoken with us; but I was not minded to indulge in conversation just at [65] that moment, and it seemed much as if Percy had the same idea. \n \n Beginning to realize more fully each moment what this duty on which we were embarked might mean, I feared lest we grow faint-hearted because of the perils. To have spoken with any one regarding the service, would have been to show us more plainly all that it meant, and silence was safest if we would hold our uncle\u0027s good opinion. \n \n The horses were saddled, and we about to mount when Gavin Witherspoon, whom I had not seen since the attack, came up hurriedly and with the air of one who is in a fault-finding mood. \n \n \"So! We are much puffed up with pride, eh, since it has been our good fortune to follow Major James in pursuit of a lot of scurvy Tories? We don\u0027t care to speak with old friends?\" \n \n \"Now you are disgruntled without cause, Gavin Witherspoon,\" Percy said laughingly. \"How may it be possible that we [66] speak with old or new friends when we fail to meet them. Since you dropped the fish so hurriedly, we have not had a glimpse of your face, and I question if you cared to meet us until, perhaps, within an hour.\" \n \n \"I have been looking for you high and low since we came to a halt here.\" \n \n \"Then it must be your eyes are grown dim with age,\" I said, now joining my brother in his mirth, for the old man\u0027s anger was comical rather than serious. \"We unsaddled our horses in this spot, and have remained until within ten minutes under this same tree, therefore it could not have been a difficult matter to find us.\" \n \n \"But there is no reason for fault-finding, and we have little time to spend in conversation,\" Percy added. \n \n \"You will speak with me though!\" Gavin said, seizing the bridle of my horse as if fearing I was about to ride away. \"In what direction are you two lads going?\" [67] \n \n \"That we may not say,\" Percy replied quickly. \"It is enough that we are acting upon General Marion\u0027s orders.\" \n \n \"That is as I suspected,\" Gavin cried, shaking his fist at Percy as if the lad had proven himself guilty of some serious crime. \"You would slip away from the old man, believing yourselves so wondrous brave that he isn\u0027t fit to join in any adventure however trifling?\" \n \n \"Now you are talking wildly, Gavin Witherspoon,\" I said, losing my patience, for, knowing we had but little time at our disposal, I was fretted by what seemed to me no more than folly. \"We have been entrusted with a duty which must be performed immediately, and may not stand here parleying with you over trifling matters.\" \n \n \"It is my intention you shall remain until I can have speech with General Marion, or failing him, with Major James.\" \n \n \"Why should we wait for that?\" Percy asked, leaping into the saddle, and as he [68] did so the old man seized the bridle of his horse also. \n \n \"Because I am counting on going with you. I promised your mother six months or more ago that when you two lads were minded to turn soldiers I would keep an eye upon you, and now has come the time when I must fulfil the pledge, or write myself down a liar.\" \n \n I knew enough of the old man\u0027s character to understand that we could not browbeat him into loosing his hold of the bridle, and was not minded to ride over him. Therefore said with as much of patience as I could assume: \n \n \"So that you move quickly, we will wait until you can speak with either officer you name; but remember, Gavin, we are under orders to set off without delay.\" \n \n \"What have you in the way of weapons?\" \n \n Until this moment, strange as it may seem, I had entirely lost sight of the fact that we were virtually unarmed, and now [69] I realized the folly of setting out so wholly unprepared. \n \n \"We must have ammunition if nothing more,\" I said hurriedly, \"and while you are gone in search of the general, I will set about procuring it. Therefore the time spent in waiting for you will not be wasted.\" \n \n Gavin Witherspoon now seemed to have every confidence that we would not slip away from him, and hurried off toward the other end of the encampment, while I went from one acquaintance to another in search of powder and ball. \n \n In this quest I was more successful than had seemed possible. \n \n Knowing that we lads had been entrusted with a mission, the men bestirred themselves to see that we were outfitted properly, and soon our store of ammunition was even greater than could be used to advantage. \n \n We had two horns full of powder, thirty or forty balls, and a couple of pistols; [70] more than that would have hampered our movements. \n \n Perhaps no more than ten minutes had been spent in outfitting ourselves, and yet this time was sufficient for Gavin to make his preparations to accompany us, as was shown when he rode up while I was dividing the ammunition with Percy. \n \n \"Is it really your purpose to follow us?\" I asked in surprise, for it had not seemed to me probable the old man would be allowed to join in the venture. \n \n \"I am not countin\u0027 to follow, lads; but ride side by side with you, and perhaps somewhat in advance. I\u0027m not thinkin\u0027 of letting you go on this mission alone—\" \n \n \"It may be safer for two than for three,\" Percy said half to himself, and the old man, without so much as turning his head, replied solemnly and in such a tone as impressed me strangely: \n \n \"There is nothing whatsoever of safety in an attempt to ride from here to Dubose Ferry, for two, or even a dozen of those [71] who love the cause. My going with you will neither increase nor lessen the danger, because that is impossible. It may be, however, that I can give a word of advice which will prevent your coming to a final end quite so soon, for I hold to it that General Marion and Major James have this day sent you lads to what is little less than death.\" \n \n Having thus spoken, and in a manner well calculated to disturb even the stoutest hearted lad, the old man wheeled his horse about and rode in the direction of Dubose Ferry, never so much as turning his head to see if we were following him. \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1488/44527.html","bookId":1323,"book":{"id":1323,"title":"With the Swamp Fox","description":"简介： He who sets himself down to write of his own deeds in order that future generations may know exactly what part he bore in freeing the colonies from the burdens put upon them by a wicked king, must have some other excuse, or reason, than that of self-...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1488","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:51 AM"}}
