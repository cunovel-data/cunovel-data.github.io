{"id":39131,"no":6,"title":"CHAPTER VI. THE PRISONERS.","content":"Giving no heed to those around us, we continued on when the command was halted, much as if we had not heard the orders, and without anything in the way of leave-taking. \\n\\n \\n\\n I know not how it may have been with my companions; but as for myself, I was in no mood to speak even with my uncle, so thickly did the sad and gloomy thoughts flow through my mind. It was to me as if we were playing the last acts in that drama which should have had a glorious ending—as if we were assisting at the death of the Cause, and I believe that nine out of every ten men in the brigade had some such thought as myself. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was true that we might strike a blow at Nelson\u0027s Ferry, but let the reader remember [121] that ours was probably the only armed force, true to the colonies, then in the Carolinas; let him remember that the Britishers overran our land, even as did the locusts of old, and how might four hundred men or less oppose all the soldiers the king could send against us? \\n\\n \\n\\n Surely for us of the southern colonies, this night, when we three set out to spy upon the victorious troops coming down from Camden with our friends as prisoners, was the worst ever known. \\n\\n \\n\\n We were beaten—hemmed in, and, like rats in the corner, could only make one desperate fight, not against death, but simply as proof that our courage held good even to the very last moment. \\n\\n \\n\\n Let all these things be borne well in mind, and it is little wonder that when we rode on after the command was halted, we were in no mood for leave-taking. Ours might, and it seemed probable it would, be the last blow in a gallant struggle for liberty. [122] \\n\\n \\n\\n When we passed the group of officers at the head of the column, all sitting their horses motionless as statues, looking neither to the right nor the left, but each man as it were peering into the recesses of his own heart, asking himself in what way the end would come, I gave one glance toward my uncle, and it seemed to me as if there was a certain uplifting of the eyebrows which I interpreted as a \"good-by.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n More than that we saw not, and five minutes later the brigade of Williamsburg patriots, tried and true, were left behind, while we two lads and the old man rode forward, hoping almost against hope that it might be possible we should accomplish something toward showing the British king how strong in our hearts was the desire for liberty. \\n\\n \\n\\n Our horses, jaded by the long march of the day, were unwilling to leave the troop; they went forward listlessly, and we had not the heart to spur them on because it [123] was much as if they shared our feelings. \\n\\n \\n\\n I question if we gained ten miles in advance of the column that night. \\n\\n \\n\\n Certain it is we were not yet come within the vicinity of Nelson\u0027s Ferry when Gavin Witherspoon\u0027s horse stopped short, and the old man said as he dismounted slowly: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We may as well rest here for the night, as a mile or two further on. I propose that we halt until a couple of hours before sunrise, and by so doing we shall gain time.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n After the experience we had had with the old man, Percy and I were more than willing to follow his advice, and we set about making ourselves as comfortable as might be under all the circumstances. \\n\\n \\n\\n A better place for camping could not be found. A tiny brook running through a grove of pines, where the underbrush was so dense as to form ample hiding-place, as well as a shelter from the dews of the night. There was little green feed for the [124] horses; but we carried a goodly store of grain on our saddles, and, heedless of the possible necessities of the future which seemed so dark, we allowed the tired steeds to eat their pleasure from the store. \\n\\n \\n\\n Such food as we had, and as I have said was taken from the Tory camp, we ate, and then, lame and sore in every joint from the long hours in the saddle, we laid ourselves down for perchance the last sleep on this earth. \\n\\n \\n\\n My eyes were closed in slumber within two or three minutes after I was thus stretched at full length upon the bed of pine needles, and it seemed as if I had slept several hours when something—I know not what—awakened me. \\n\\n \\n\\n There was no movement, and the faint light of the stars did not penetrate the thicket; yet I could see that the horses were lying down; that my comrades were wrapped in slumber, and it puzzled me to make out why I was thus wakeful. \\n\\n \\n\\n Then, partially turning my head, for no [125] other reason than to make a change of position, I saw what appeared to be the reflection of a camp-fire through the underbrush. \\n\\n \\n\\n When one knows that he is surrounded by enemies, the lightest thing out of the ordinary arouses his suspicions, and although this gleam of light was so faint that at another time I would have given no heed to it, now it seemed absolutely necessary I should understand the cause. \\n\\n \\n\\n It would be foolish to awaken my comrades, so I argued, when there might be no good reason, and I crept out through the bushes softly until, having traversed a distance of fifty yards or more, when I saw that we were not the only ones who had utilized this thicket as a camp. \\n\\n \\n\\n Four men sat around a small fire eating, and near by were tethered their horses. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was fortunate our steeds were so leg-weary, else when this party drove up they might have given the alarm, for I doubted not but that these were enemies. At such [126] time in the history of the so-called rebellion we had so few friends as to be able to say with a certainty where they were. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was in my mind to return at once and arouse Gavin Witherspoon and Percy, that we might make our escape; but all was so quiet, and these four apparently unsuspicious that any save themselves were in the vicinity, that I delayed carrying out the purpose in my mind, until, having almost unconsciously approached a few yards nearer, I recognized in one of them, that Tory villain, Sam Lee. \\n\\n \\n\\n Once this discovery was made I no longer thought of returning to where I had left my comrades; but wriggled along yet nearer, and was well repaid for the delay. \\n\\n \\n\\n It would seem as if the men had been questioning young Lee as to his ability to do something which had been promised, for one of them was saying when I came within earshot: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It is a blind chase to push ahead in search of a party of rebels who by this [127] time may have returned home, hoping to keep secret the part they have been playing.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n To this Sam Lee replied hotly, much as if the honor of the James family were in his keeping: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The major will never go home alive so long as one other can be found to remain with him, and there are many of his kin in Williamsburg.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But what reason have we for believing you can lead us to them?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Because I know of their haunts,\" the scoundrel said, as if he was telling the truth. \"So far all they have accomplished has been by surprising our people who are not soldiers; but I guarantee that you men of the Prince of Wales\u0027 regiment will make a different showing among them.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Of that I have no question; but these people, knowing fully the country, can easily disperse between the time we come upon them, and word has been sent to the command. Then again, we must trust to [128] your finding them, which I misdoubt greatly, else are you a keener lad than I have seen in the Carolinas.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n It was the eldest of the three men who said this, and as he moved slightly I saw that his uniform, which I knew full well, was that of the Prince of Wales\u0027 regiment, to which organization Sam Lee had referred. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You may do as you please,\" the young Troy said angrily. \"I have told the colonel that I could lead you to where the scarecrow Marion was encamped and put you on their trail wheresoever the forces might be going; but if, now that we are hardly more than started, you choose to turn back, it is none of my affair, I have done my part.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n No reply was made to this, and for a time the men were silent, while I, speculating as to what might be their purpose, believed it was a simple matter to guess why they were there. \\n\\n \\n\\n We knew full well that Sam Lee had been [129] in Captain Barfield\u0027s encampment, and, like the coward that he was, fled when our troops came up. He also must have ridden all day in order to gain Nelson\u0027s Ferry; had most likely met this regiment of the king\u0027s, and claimed ability to deliver our people into their hands. It seemed also true that these troopers had ridden in advance of the command, as had we three, and we were thus come together at a place midway between the Britishers and our own force. \\n\\n \\n\\n Up to this point I had no difficulty in forming a satisfactory conclusion; but beyond that I was all at sea, and naturally thought the proper course was to return and give information to Gavin Witherspoon. \\n\\n \\n\\n In fact I was in the act of turning when one of the soldiers said grumblingly: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Even though the rebels may be where this lad has stated, I fail to see why we should have left the camp and ridden half a dozen miles in advance. What good can be gained by spending the night here, [130] when we might have done so with our comrades?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"For my part,\" the third trooper added, \"I would rather sleep here than do my share of guarding an hundred or more scurvy rebels. Had we stayed in camp some portion of the duty would have come upon us, whereas we may lie down under these bushes and sleep until it pleases us to open our eyes next morning.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That is all very true,\" the first speaker replied; \"yet there were good quarters to be found at Nelson\u0027s Ferry, and here a bed upon the ground is the best to be had.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n It was almost with difficulty that I suppressed a cry of triumph, for now I had the full story, and we might return with the information desired by General Marion before having fairly set out to do the work. \\n\\n \\n\\n The British force, comprised in whole or in part of the Prince of Wales\u0027 regiment, and guarding an hundred or more of our people, captured when General Gates was [131] defeated, were encamped at Nelson\u0027s Ferry, six or seven miles away. These fellows, through information given by Sam Lee, were coming out in search of us, and would not leave their halting-place until sunrise. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was a lucky chance which led us to this spot, and the forebodings which had weighed heavily upon me a few hours previous, were lightened wonderfully by the thought that fortune, which had borne so hardly upon us in the past, was about taking a turn in our favor. \\n\\n \\n\\n I lost no time in returning at once to my comrades, although forced to do so slowly lest I make so much of noise that the Tory and his red-coated companions be warned of our nearness. \\n\\n \\n\\n Then, having arrived by the side of Percy and Gavin Witherspoon, I pressed both hands upon their mouths to prevent any cry in their awakening. \\n\\n \\n\\n The old man\u0027s grasp upon my arm told that he was fully alive to the situation, [132] and I repeated as quickly as might be all that had been heard. \\n\\n \\n\\n Sitting bolt upright as if any future movement depended wholly upon me, he said in a whisper: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Whether the horses can cover sixteen or twenty miles after a long day\u0027s work, is a question.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But one which you should not ask,\" Percy added in a more serious tone than I had ever heard him employ. \"We have gained the information for which we were sent, and it must be carried back to camp without delay.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I grant you that, lad; but was only asking myself whether it might be possible for our people to take advantage of it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Such speculations can be deferred until we have spoken with General Marion,\" Percy replied as he arose, and after that there was no discussion among us. \\n\\n \\n\\n To get the horses on their feet without making a noise was no slight task; but [133] we accomplished it after a certain fashion, and led them out of the thicket, not mounting until we were fully two miles away. \\n\\n \\n\\n After that our progress was no more rapid than if we had remained on foot, for it seemed impossible to urge the animals at a pace faster than a walk, and it appeared to me as if the morning must be near at hand when we were finally come to the encampment. \\n\\n \\n\\n All our men were not given over to slumber, as was shown by our being challenged before yet we knew how near to us was the military force, and five minutes later we were standing beside our uncle, who, suddenly aroused from his sleep, asked with a note of alarm in his tones: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What disaster has befallen you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n We soon gave him to understand that fortune had played us a good turn, and immediately the information was given he became animated. \\n\\n \\n\\n One would have said he had never known [134] fatigue, to have seen him as he ran toward where General Marion was sleeping, and, shaking the officer into wakefulness, he repeated in a few words our story. \\n\\n \\n\\n I had supposed the news we brought would cause some sensation in the camp; but never believed it would be acted upon so quickly. \\n\\n \\n\\n Within fifteen minutes from the time of our being challenged by the sentinel, every man was in the saddle, and Percy, Gavin Witherspoon and myself were riding at the head of the column by my uncle\u0027s side, in order that we might point out the place where the soldiers and Sam Lee were encamped. \\n\\n \\n\\n We now learned that it was midnight; the tired men and their horses had had six hours of rest, and although the advance was not rapid, we pressed forward with greater speed than I had believed possible, our own steeds seeming to be revived by the companionship of the others. \\n\\n \\n\\n Now I am come to that point in this [135] story concerning which I can say but little of my own knowledge, for certain it is that I fell asleep even while in the saddle, and was not conscious of anything until the halting of my horse nearly threw me over his head. \\n\\n \\n\\n We had arrived within two miles of Nelson\u0027s Ferry, and it was yet night. Unless some unfortunate accident occurred at the last moment, there was an opportunity of our soon learning whether the British regulars would hold firm under such a surprise as we should be able to give them. \\n\\n \\n\\n The purpose of the halt was not to reconnoiter, as I had at first supposed, but in order that a squad of twenty might be detached to gain possession of the road in the swamp at that post known as Horse Creek, while we were to attack the main body in the rear. \\n\\n \\n\\n The scouts who had been sent ahead half an hour before my awakening, came back reporting that the enemy were encamped [136] on the east bank of the creek, which was another and a great point in our favor. \\n\\n \\n\\n Once more would General Marion have a chance to execute his favorite maneuver, the only one by which we could hope to win while the odds were so heavily against us. \\n\\n \\n\\n Twenty minutes or more were spent here waiting for the detachment to get into position at Horse Creek, and then the advance was resumed, this time at a slow pace lest the thud of our horses\u0027 feet upon the road should give an alarm. \\n\\n \\n\\n Despite the fact that I knew full well we would soon be engaged in deadly encounter, slumber weighed heavily upon my eyelids, and it was with difficulty I could prevent them from closing. \\n\\n \\n\\n Rather like one in a dream, than a lad who burned to give his life for the Cause, did I hold myself in the saddle, and it seemed as if no more than ten minutes had passed when we were halted again, [137] this time so near the enemy that the gleam of his camp-fires could be seen. \\n\\n \\n\\n The moment for reflection had come. \\n\\n \\n\\n General Marion\u0027s force was about to be hurled upon the best men in the king\u0027s army. We who knew little or nothing of military tactics, we who were mounted upon jaded steeds, and half dead for lack of sleep, were about to charge a camp of well armed men, most likely in the best possible condition, and if the end for us of the southern colonies was near, it seemed as if this was indeed the last moment. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"At full speed, and do not fire until we are close upon them!\" was the whispered word passed from man to man, and I saw those either side of me carefully charging their rifles or muskets. \\n\\n \\n\\n Even though we were come upon the Prince of Wales\u0027 regiment and a portion of the 63d Regulars, as was afterward learned, the result was much the same as when we rode down upon the undisciplined Tories. [138] \\n\\n \\n\\n There was the onward leaping of the horses as the spurs were sunk deep in their flanks; the thunder of their hoofs; the cries of the enemy as they were awakened from their slumbers; our shouts of triumph; the crackle of musketry and the groans of the wounded. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was a dream—a horrible nightmare rather than a reality, and had I been a spectator instead of a participant, it would have seemed no different. \\n\\n \\n\\n At such times the excitement of the battle is full upon one, and I have yet to see man or boy who can give a clear and detailed account of all that occurred while the scent of the powder was in his nostrils. \\n\\n \\n\\n This much I do know, that, as twice before, I loaded and discharged my musket, or used it as a club; that I forced my horse to keep pace with my uncle\u0027s steed, who was ever foremost in the fray, and then the fleeing mass told that the enemy were in retreat. [139] \\n\\n \\n\\n This victory, when the majority of our men had believed the attack would prove our final ending, did more to revive the drooping spirits of General Marion\u0027s force than anything else could have done. \\n\\n \\n\\n We forgot weariness; forgot everything save the fact that we of Williamsburg had been pitted against the king\u0027s best soldiers, and were come out of the battle as well as when we met Major Gainey\u0027s or Barfield\u0027s men. \\n\\n \\n\\n On this occasion, however, we did not press the pursuit. It was known that these soldiers would re-form, where raw recruits might continue panic-stricken, and we were not so strong in numbers as to risk a regular engagement. \\n\\n \\n\\n My uncle was the foremost here, as he ever had been, and Percy and I remained by his side, therefore can I say of a verity that we did not ride after the retreating column more than half a mile; but, once well clear of the encampment, drew rein and turned about. [140] \\n\\n \\n\\n It was now near to daylight, and we soon learned that we had captured or killed twenty-two regulars, among whom was a captain, and held two Tories as prisoners. \\n\\n \\n\\n Our loss was one killed and one wounded. \\n\\n \\n\\n In addition to having thus gained a victory over the best of his majesty\u0027s soldiers in the colonies, we had recaptured one hundred and fifty men, and it is not necessary to say how much of rejoicing there was in our lines when the sun rose. \\n\\n \\n\\n Now am I come to the shameful part of the story, and one which will be most difficult of belief. \\n\\n \\n\\n To Percy and I it seemed that with this successful attack, by liberating one hundred and fifty men who were supposed to be friends to the Cause, because of wearing the Continental uniform, we had added just so much to General Marion\u0027s strength, and neither of us had any question but that every one of them would gladly join our force. [141] \\n\\n \\n\\n As we two believed, so did all our comrades as well as the officers who led us, for after the first rejoicings were over those who had been prisoners were ordered into line, and Major James proposed, with the air of one who thinks he makes what will be accepted without question, that they enroll themselves among us of Williamsburg until such time as we could fight our way through the district to where others who loved the Cause might be found. \\n\\n \\n\\n To the shame of these Continental soldiers it must be set down that out of that number freed by us at risk of our lives, only three consented to serve under the general. \\n\\n \\n\\n Some said that the \"Cause was lost;\" others declared that to fight longer was \"simply to risk one\u0027s life without an object, because the king\u0027s troops overrun the country, and after the defeat of Gates there was no longer the slightest chance we could hold our own many days.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n When no more than these three stepped forward from the ranks in response to his [142] proposal, and the others talked loudly among themselves, or with our men, my uncle turned away like one who is stricken with a deadly wound. \\n\\n \\n\\n Then Percy and I made our way among these men who wore the buff and the blue, to hear further reasons as to why they had acted such a cowardly part. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was a captain, one who should have been the first to urge his men to enlist, who said in reply to my questions: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Surely the Cause has none in the Carolinas, save this beggarly force to which you are attached, while the British have overrun this section of the country. The Continentals are dispersed or captured; the Virginia and North Carolina militia are scattered to the four winds; Sumter\u0027s Legion has been whipped by Tarleton, and their leader is fleeing for his life. In addition to all that, here is a copy of the letter which Lord Clinton has sent to the commandants of the different posts throughout the colonies.\" [143] \\n\\n \\n\\n Then the officer handed me a slip of paper on which was written the following: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I have given orders that all of the inhabitants of this province who have subscribed, and have taken part in this revolt, should be punished with the greatest rigor; and also those who will not turn out, that they may be imprisoned and their whole property taken from them or destroyed.... I have ordered in the most positive manner that every militiaman, who has borne arms with us, and afterwards joined the enemy, shall be immediately hanged!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1488/44530.html","bookId":1323,"book":{"id":1323,"title":"With the Swamp Fox","description":"简介： He who sets himself down to write of his own deeds in order that future generations may know exactly what part he bore in freeing the colonies from the burdens put upon them by a wicked king, must have some other excuse, or reason, than that of self-...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1488","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:51 AM"}}
