{"id":39136,"no":11,"title":"CHAPTER XI. GABRIEL.","content":"I know not how to set down properly such a narrative as this, and, therefore, should be excused for such mistakes as may occur through ignorance and inexperience. It is with the attack upon Georgetown that I must end this portion of the adventures which befell Percy and myself during the time we served under General Marion, and it may be the story should be continued straight on without any heed whatsoever to those who fought with us, although in the same squad. Whether it be right or wrong, I cannot well neglect to speak of the part played by that other party of twenty who volunteered their lives as eagerly as did we who followed Captain Melton, and what I write [239] concerning them must, of course, be from hearsay. Therefore it seems to me proper to tell first the story of Colonel Horry\u0027s squad, as I have heard it related again and again, before attempting to set down that which I know of my own knowledge. When the forty volunteers were divided into two squads there was no time lost, as I have already said, in setting forward upon that mission which we believed could be fully accomplished only through the sacrifice of us all, and we parted at the limits of the temporary halting place, Captain Melton leading his force to the right, while Colonel Horry began the reconnoiter by bearing to the left. As to what befell the first squad, this is as I have heard it related: They continued on through the woods until near to daybreak, when, as Colonel Horry himself has said, and I am now quoting from his official account, he \"laid an ambuscade, with my twenty men, near [240] the road. About sunrise a chair appeared with two ladies escorted by two British officers. I was ready in advance with an officer to cut them off, but reflecting that they might escape, and alarm the town, which would prevent my taking greater numbers, I desisted. The officers and chair halted very near me, but soon the chair went on, and the officers galloped into the town. Our party continued in ambush until 10 o\u0027clock. \"Nothing appearing, and we having eaten nothing for many hours, retired to a plantation not far distant, where I knew were to be found friends. As soon as I entered the house four ladies appeared, two of whom were Mrs. White and her daughter. I was asked what I wanted. I answered, food, refreshment. The other two ladies were those whom I had seen escorted by the British officers. \"The strange ladies seemed greatly agitated, and begged most earnestly that I would go away. I kept my eye on Mrs. [241] White, and saw she had a smiling countenance, but said nothing. Soon she left the room, and I left it also and went into the piazza, laid my cap, sword and pistols on the long bench, and walked the piazza; when I discovered Mrs. White behind the house chimney beckoning me. \"I got to her undiscovered by the young ladies, when she said: \u0027Colonel Horry, be on your guard; these two young ladies are just from Georgetown; they are much frightened, and I believe the British are leaving it and may soon attack you. As to provisions, I have plenty in yonder barn, but you must affect to take them by force.\u0027 \"I begged her to say no more, for I was well acquainted with all such matters. We both secretly returned, she to the room where the young ladies were, and I to the piazza I had just left.\" The colonel had no more than gained this point, when the sentinels gave an alarm. [242] Two musket-shots told him that an enemy was near at hand, and almost immediately afterward the firing became so rapid that he knew an encounter was already begun. That brave officer thought only of his men, and so nearly were the interests of the squad allied, that he forgot all else save the desire to be with them in the time of danger. He rushed into the fight, forgetting to take with him even his saber—intent only on being with those who had so well proven their devotion to the Cause. The British were seventeen in number, well armed, and commanded by a brave fellow named Merritt; but they were taken by surprise. The redcoats retreated, but turned in their flight to strike a blow, and our men, believing they had been ordered on even to death, pursued with fatal earnestness. Of the enemy\u0027s force only two men escaped death or capture, and one of these [243] was the captain, of whom Colonel Horry writes: \"My men in succession came up with Captain Merritt, who was in the rear of his party, urging them forward. They engaged him. He was a brave fellow. Baxter, with pistols, fired at his breast, and missing him, retired; Postell and Greene, with swords, engaged him; both were beaten off. Greene nearly lost his head. His buckskin breeches were cut through several inches. I almost blush to say that this one British officer beat off three Americans. Merritt escaped to a neighboring swamp, from whence, at midnight, he got to Georgetown.\" I would it were possible for me to give as brief an account, with as satisfactory an ending, regarding our portion of the reconnoiter. As has been said, after crossing White\u0027s Bridge the two squads separated, Colonel Horry\u0027s going toward the left and ours to the right. [244] Then it was, as we rode on slowly, mentally nerved for anything which might happen and fully expecting sharp and bloody work at any instant, that Gabriel Marion said, looking first at Percy and then at me: \"Perhaps it will never again be our good fortune, comrades, to have such an opportunity of proving our metal as has come to us this night. Now I am in nowise eager for death; but to my mind there is little fear that the end be near at hand. Although the odds are so strongly against us, we shall take this post of Georgetown, and I believe it because my uncle, the major, is a careful, prudent soldier, never taking upon himself chances that are utterly without hope, although many times the fact may have seemed to be the reverse. We shall capture Georgetown, comrades, and if either of us fails to come out alive, we have the proud satisfaction of knowing that whatsoever befalls the Cause our names must live among [245] those who volunteered everything for freedom.\" \"I hold to it that this is not the time for such speeches,\" Gavin Witherspoon said nervously; and had I not known him to be a man of tried courage I should have said that at that moment he was afraid. \"These forty men who came forward so gallantly understood full well in what kind of an adventure they were engaged. It does not prove that his courage is the greatest who speaks overly much regarding the future.\" \"Meaning by such speech, that I had best hold my tongue,\" Gabriel said with a laugh. \"Perhaps you may be right, and yet there is upon me the inclination to speak of what we have ventured, in order that I may be the better able to appreciate life after it has been offered as a sacrifice and refused.\" \"I guarantee that once we are come out from this expedition, you will need no thought of the past to make you understand [246] that we rode down the very shadow of death, when we crossed yonder bridge, and this I say, not because there is in my mind any foreknowledge of the future, but from what I know regarding the enemy. I realize, without being told, that ours is as desperate an undertaking as men can well imagine.\" \"I am thinking that your words, Gavin Witherspoon, are as ill-timed as were Gabriel\u0027s, for while he spoke of what might be our reward, you are weighing, as it were, the chances against us, and to my mind it is not pleasant,\" Percy said with an attempt at cheerfulness which I knew full well was forced, and, stepping nearer to the lad, I grasped his hand, an act which, perhaps, gave him as much encouragement as was in my mind to impart. Gabriel continued to speak of the future, as if he had no part in the present, until word came that each man must hold himself silent because we were come so near [247] the town that there was good reason for believing the enemy\u0027s sentinels might be close at hand. We straggled on, each as he pleased, although there was some little show of military formation. Captain Melton was allowed to remain in the lead as he had stipulated, but we four comrades took good care not to fall back more than two or three paces, for we were minded to bear the brunt of the first encounter. I had never before known what it was to advance against an enemy on foot, and the fact of being without a horse gave me a certain sense of uneasiness. So far as we of these two advanced squads were concerned, there could be no sudden dash; no spurring forward into the very midst of the enemy. We must fight our way forward slowly, and, as it seemed to me, at a disadvantage. However, it is true that my courage did not fail me, although my hand trembled with excitement, and my mouth was [248] parched and dry as if I had been many hours without water. Gabriel had just thrown his arm over my shoulder, to show the affection which was in his heart for us all, when the thud of horses\u0027 hoofs directly in the front told that the enemy were on the alert. Instantly we were halted, every man in a posture of defense, and I venture to say that there was not one among us who did not wish he was in the saddle. \"Hold steady, boys!\" Captain Melton whispered. \"Yonder comes the patrol, and it may be they will turn before coming as far as this; but if not, we have our work cut out for us. The enemy must not pass this point lest our friends in the rear be discovered!\" Involuntarily we four had crouched upon our knees in such position that we could use the muskets to good advantage, and thus we remained in the front line while the horsemen galloped nearer and nearer until they were absolutely upon us. [249] \"Fire!\" our commander shouted, and from that little squad of crouching figures a line of fire flashed forth into the very nostrils of the animals, causing them to rear and plunge madly, thus diverting our bullets from their targets. Three saddles were emptied when a full twenty would have been the result of the volley had we fired one minute before, and then every man among us began to reload his weapon with feverish haste, for but few seconds could elapse before the Britishers would charge. \"This is what may be called a real battle!\" Gabriel cried exultantly; but no one replied. Death for many of us was close at hand, and at such a time words do not come readily. I was ramming home the bullet in my musket when the horsemen again dashed upon us from out the darkness; there came a roar as if a thousand guns had been discharged at the same instant, and [250] all before me seemed to be a sheet of flame. Of what followed during the next five or ten minutes I have no clear idea. Before me reared and plunged the British horses, while here, there and everywhere I heard cries of rage or groans of mortal agony until it was all a hideous, whirling, dancing picture in which I could distinguish only the outlines of my comrades, who held their places bravely. Side by side we fought against the redcoats, ignorant of the fact that we were alone, and then came the moment when all our muskets were emptied at the same instant. The horsemen surrounded us; our weapons were of little service against the sabers of the enemy, and we understood it, although there was no thought of surrender in my mind until Gavin Witherspoon seized me by the arm, shouting in my ear: \"Surrender, lad, surrender! There is [251] neither honor nor glory in dying when our lives are of no avail for the Cause!\" Even as he spoke three of the redcoats had clutched Gabriel and Percy. I allowed my musket, which had been raised as a club, to drop, and immediately I felt, for the first time, the grasp of a Britisher. We were prisoners. The glory of fighting to the bitter end with the knowledge that in so doing we were opening the way for those in the rear, was denied us, and but for the shame of it I could have wept like a girl. And yet all this was as nothing compared with what followed. The troopers were about to disarm us, and some one had fired a torch that we might be the better seen, when Sam Lee—that miserable Tory and renegade—came up from the rear, where most likely he had been skulking during the fighting, and, seeing us, set up a shout of triumph. [252] \"Now have I got you rebels where I\u0027ve been burning to see you?\" he cried. \"Now we shall see—\" \"Is that Sam Lee?\" Gabriel shouted, struggling to release himself from his captor\u0027s grasp. \"Ay, and it is the cur who has sold his country, his kinsmen and himself for the king\u0027s gold!\" Percy replied. \"There is no dishonor in being overpowered by true soldiers in a fair fight; but to have such as that villain alive before one\u0027s eyes is a disgrace.\" \"It shall be worse than that to you!\" Sam shrieked, \"and as for that nephew of the rebel Marion, I—\" \"What are you saying?\" one of the troopers asked, seizing Sam Lee and shaking him as if to force the reply more quickly. \"Is one of these a nephew to the Swamp Fox?\" \"Ay, that he is!\" Gabriel made answer, stepping forward as far as the hand of the captor would permit. \"I am the [253] nephew of General Marion, and proud indeed of the kinship!\" I was looking at the dear lad that instant, having turned my eyes from the scurvy Tory when Gabriel began to speak, otherwise, perhaps, I might have prevented that terrible thing which followed. While the remainder of the party were looking at the brave lad who stood before them in the glare of the torches, Sam Lee, doubled-dyed villain that he was, rushed upon him with a saber which he had seized from the hand of the trooper. In the flickering light I saw the gleam of the steel, and before a word of warning could escape my lips, the cruel weapon descended, striking Gabriel full upon the head, sheering its way downward until the dear lad sank a lifeless mass at the feet of that cur who was not worthy to so much as kneel before him. On the instant it was as if my eyes were blinded by the crimson flood that followed the stroke of the blade. There was a sensation [254] as if all my blood was boiling, and, for the time being, reason left me. Gavin Witherspoon declares that I wrenched myself free from the trooper who held me, as if the Britisher had been no more than a babe, that at the same instant I leaped upon the Tory murderer, bearing him to the earth till his face was sunk deep in the blood-stained moss, and with the same weapon which had let out the life of the most gallant lad who ever lived, I killed him. It was done so quickly, Gavin declares, that the redcoats had no time to interfere before the work was accomplished, and while they, horror-stricken as it were by that which was not warfare in any sense of the word, stood before us three—two dead and one senseless, the remainder of our squad fell upon them. This last attack was successful; the Britishers were beaten off, and our brave fellows carried Gabriel\u0027s dear body, and myself, back to the rear. [255] The attempt to capture Georgetown was a failure, now that the enemy had been warned, and our brigade beat a hasty retreat. Of all that I know nothing; it was many days before my senses returned, and then we were encamped on Snow\u0027s Island. It is best that I add to my story what has been written by one who is a master hand at wielding a pen, while I am only a novice, and that I bring this portion of the adventures which befell Percy Sumter and myself to an end, with the promise to write out at some later day what we two did when the work of the patriots was finally crowned with success. \"The murder of Gabriel Marion, with some other instances of brutality and butchery on the part of the Tories, happening about this time, gave a more savage character than ever to the warfare which ensued. Motives of private anger and personal [256] revenge embittered and increased the usual ferocities of civil war; and hundreds of dreadful and desperate tragedies caused the inhabitants to pursue each other rather like wild beasts than like men. \"In the Cheraw district, on the Pedee, above the line where Marion commanded, the warfare was one of utter extermination. The revolutionary struggle in Carolina was of a sort unknown in any other part of the union. \"The attempt upon Georgetown was defeated. The British had taken the alarm, and were now in strength, and in a state of vigilance and activity which precluded the possibility of surprise. Marion\u0027s wishes, therefore, with regard to this place, were deferred accordingly to a more auspicious season. \"He retired to Snow\u0027s Island, where he made his camp. It was peculiarly eligible for his purposes, furnishing a secure retreat, a depot for his arms, ammunition, [257] prisoners and invalids—difficult of access, easily guarded, and contiguous to the scenes of his most active operations. \"Snow\u0027s Island lies at the confluence of Lynch\u0027s Creek and the Pedee. On the east flows the latter river; on the west, Clark\u0027s Creek, issuing from Lynch\u0027s and a stream navigable for small vessels; on the north lies Lynch\u0027s Creek, wide and deep, but nearly choked by rafts of logs and refuse timber. The island, high river swamp, was spacious, and, like all the Pedee river swamp of that day, abounded in live stock and provision. Thick woods covered the elevated tracts, dense cane-brakes the lower, and here and there the eye rested upon a cultivated spot, in maize, which the invalids and convalescents were wont to tend. \"Here Marion made his fortress. Having secured all the boats of the neighborhood, he chose such as he needed, and destroyed the rest. Where the natural defenses of the island seemed to require [258] aid from art, he bestowed it; and, by cutting away bridges and obstructing the ordinary pathways with timber, he contrived to insulate, as much as possible, the country under his command. \"From this fortress his scouting parties were sent forth nightly in all directions. Enemies were always easy to be found. The British maintained minor posts at Nelson\u0027s Ferry and Scott\u0027s Lake, as well as Georgetown; and the Tories on Lynch\u0027s Creek and Little Pedee were much more numerous, if less skilfully conducted, than the men of Marion. \"Marion\u0027s encampment implied no repose, no forbearance of the active business of war. Very far from it. He was never more dangerous to an enemy than when he seemed quiet in camp. \"His camp, indeed, was frequently a lure, by which to tempt the Tories into unseasonable exposure. The post at Snow\u0027s Island gave him particular facilities for this species of warfare. He had but to [259] cross a river, and a three hours\u0027 march enabled him to forage in an enemy\u0027s country. \"Reinforcements came to him daily, and it was only now, for the first time, that his command began to assume the appearance, and exhibit the force of a brigade.\" The End","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1488/44535.html","bookId":1323,"book":{"id":1323,"title":"With the Swamp Fox","description":"简介： He who sets himself down to write of his own deeds in order that future generations may know exactly what part he bore in freeing the colonies from the burdens put upon them by a wicked king, must have some other excuse, or reason, than that of self-...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1488","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:51 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:51 AM"}}
