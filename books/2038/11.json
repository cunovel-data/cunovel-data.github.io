{"id":109178,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"Someone was screaming in the desert, and I didn\u0027t realize it was me until Tim raced over and grabbed my shoulders.\n \"Jesus! Eugenie, what\u0027s wrong?\"\n I broke from him, dropped to my knees, and threw up into a convenient shrub. That soon gave way to endless dry heaves, my body\u0027s distress too strong to stop. When I finally finished - it seemed like hours but was probably only a few minutes - I ran my hands over my face. It felt like I had shoved my head through a window, cutting my skin to shreds. Yet, when I pulled my hands back, there was no blood.\n Apparently convinced I was done bringing up everything in my stomach, Tim carefully handed me a bottle of water. I wiped my mouth with the back of my hand and then drank greedily. When I started to hand the bottle back, he shook his head. \"Keep it. What happened?\"\n \"Transition shock,\" came Volusian\u0027s flat voice. \"You came through the worlds too hard and too fast, mistress.\"\n \"You should be dead,\" added Nandi. \"Or at least segmented.\"\n \"Segmented?\" asked Tim.\n I nodded and drank again. \"If you\u0027re not strong enough to make it work, only your spirit will get back here. The body stays in the Otherworld.\"\n He stared. \"Will that kill you?\"\n \"Worse.\"\n \"What\u0027s worse than death?\" asked a new voice. Or not so new.\n Wil. I\u0027d forgotten about Wil.\n I leapt to my feet and spun toward him, gun drawn. Some part of me wondered if I even had bullets left. I\u0027d changed the cartridge once in the Otherworld but couldn\u0027t recall how many times I\u0027d fired at Aeson\u0027s men.\n Tim\u0027s mouth dropped open. \"Eugenie, put that away!\"\n \"You don\u0027t know what he\u0027s done. He\u0027s a fucking backstabber.\"\n Wil, sitting on the blanket he\u0027d gone into trance on, froze, too afraid to move. But not too afraid to speak.\n \"I had to. It was the only way to get Jasmine.\"\n \"Yeah, it worked pretty well, huh?\"\n He sounded near tears. \"I\u0027d gone a year without any chance of getting her. Then that sprite cut me the deal. Said if I got you to go over, they\u0027d give me Jasmine back. I\u0027m sorry.\"\n I didn\u0027t move the gun. \"I was your only chance to get her back. If you hadn\u0027t led us into that trap, we\u0027d be back here with her now.\"\n He groaned, burying his face in his hands. \"I didn\u0027t know. I didn\u0027t know. I just wanted her so badly.\" He looked back up at me. \"What happened? Why did she run away? Was she scared?\"\n \"Maybe. Or it could be that...what\u0027s that called? Where people help their kidnappers? Stockholm syndrome?\"\n \"What, like Patty Hearst? No. Jasmine wouldn\u0027t do that.\"\n I wasn\u0027t so sure. She was young and impressionable, and Aeson struck me as a very forceful figure.\n \"He\u0027s too pathetic to kill,\" observed Finn after studying Wil for a moment.\n \"No harm in doing it anyway,\" said Volusian. \"Kill him and enslave his soul.\"\n Wil\u0027s eyes widened farther.\n \"Eugenie!\" Tim stared at me like I was insane. \"You aren\u0027t seriously considering that.\"\n Probably not. Sighing, I lowered the gun. \"Get out of here, Wil. I don\u0027t ever want to see you again.\"\n He scrambled to his feet, face falling. \"But Jasmine - \"\n \"You lost your chance. You blew it. Get in your car before I do something stupid.\"\n Wil hesitated, his face pleading and upset. Then wordlessly he headed toward the trail that led out to a makeshift parking area. I watched him leave, bitter anger boiling up within me. In the distance, thunder rumbled.\n \"Eugenie...\" began Tim hesitantly. A slight wind ruffled his hair.\n \"I don\u0027t want to talk about it. Take me home.\"\n We gathered up his things and walked in the direction Wil had gone.\n \"Meet me back at my house,\" I told the minions. They vanished.\n Tim had enough sense to leave me alone on the car ride back. I leaned my head against the window, liking the feel of the cool glass against my fevered cheek. So many things had happened tonight, I had no idea what to fixate on first. Jasmine? Wil\u0027s betrayal? Aeson\u0027s stupid accusation? Kiyo?\n Yes. Kiyo was probably the safest, which was saying something. My heart had leapt at seeing him again. It was stupid, considering the way he\u0027d used me, but my emotions didn\u0027t appear to realize that yet. Why? Why did he have this pull on me when I barely knew him? I didn\u0027t believe in love at first sight.\n And what about the fox thing? I knew of no gentry who could do that, but I did know shape-shifters filled the Otherworld. I\u0027d fought some before but never a fox. Seemed like a weird choice. Perhaps that explained why he hadn\u0027t felt gentry. He was something else, not gentry but still Otherworldly. Not much of an improvement.\n I left Tim as soon as we got home, seeking out the solitude of my room. Well, as much solitude as I could get with the three spirits waiting for me. I threw myself onto the bed, leaning into the corner where the bed sat against the wall. Exhaustion ran through me, and I did and said nothing, staring into the darkness. Thunder rumbled again but seemed fainter now, like the storm had changed its mind. The spirits simply waited and watched me.\n \"Tell me what just happened.\"\n \"Um, which part?\" asked Finn after a minute.\n \"Any of it. Tell me what Kiyo is. The fox.\"\n \"Oh.\" Finn seemed relieved to have a question he could answer. \"He\u0027s a kitsune. Japanese fox spirit.\"\n \"Roland taught me hundreds of magical creatures. Never heard of a kitsune.\"\n \"You don\u0027t find them around here much,\" explained Finn. \"And they\u0027re not really dangerous.\"\n \"He looked dangerous enough to me.\"\n \"They carry animal traits into human form,\" said Volusian. \"Strength. Speed. A certain sense of aggression.\"\n I thought about sex with Kiyo. Yeah. That had been pretty aggressive. I closed my eyes.\n \"Why would he mark me and then follow me?\"\n \"I do not know.\"\n It figured.\n \"Anything else I should know about him? About them?\"\n \"They\u0027re usually female. Men are rare. Perhaps his human blood affected that,\" said Nandi in her emotionless voice.\n \"Half-human? Oh. His mother was the kitsune,\" I mused, recalling him talking about his parents.\n \"Yeah,\" agreed Finn. \"The women are supposed to be pretty hot. Like sirens. Real seductive. Men can\u0027t stay away from them.\"\n \"Like a drug,\" added Volusian.\n I opened my eyes. \"Could he do that too?\"\n \"Possibly.\"\n Suddenly my obsession seemed less weird than twisted. Had he used some sort of sexual power to lure me in? Was that why I couldn\u0027t stop thinking about him?\n \"I guess half-human isn\u0027t so bad,\" I muttered, speaking out loud without meaning to. I hadn\u0027t bedded a full-fledged Otherworldly creature.\n \"Not bad at all,\" agreed Finn happily. \"He\u0027s just like you.\"\n \"Stop it,\" I snapped. \"That whole thing...what Aeson said...it\u0027s stupid. I don\u0027t want to talk about it.\"\n \"And like so much, you ignore what you don\u0027t want to hear. Being Storm King\u0027s daughter is no small thing.\" Volusian\u0027s red eyes held my gaze.\n \"Your bluntness is so endearing.\" My stomach turned, but it was now or never. \"All right. I\u0027ll bite. Why does Aeson think that?\"\n None of them had an answer right away. The impression I got from them was surprise more than ignorance.\n \"Because you are, mistress,\" said Nandi at last.\n \"No, I\u0027m not. I\u0027m human.\"\n Volusian crossed his arms over his chest. \"You are half-human, mistress. And as I said, your prejudice blinds you from the truth.\"\n \"One gentry\u0027s accusation isn\u0027t the truth. Where are the facts?\"\n \"Facts? Very well. Here are facts. Who is your father?\"\n \"Roland.\"\n \"You know what I mean, mistress. Who is your blood father?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know. It doesn\u0027t matter. My mom always said he was a bastard not worth knowing.\"\n Volusian stared at me expectantly.\n \"That doesn\u0027t prove anything.\"\n \"What about your powers? You are rapidly surpassing every other human shaman. You are equal in strength in both worlds. Do you think it\u0027s coincidence that the most powerful shaman in remembered history grew up in Roland Markham\u0027s household? He brought you there, taking you from Storm King.\"\n \"From where? Are you saying I was born in the Otherworld?\"\n Volusian inclined his head. \"Storm King abducted your mother and made her his mistress. She bore his child. You.\"\n \"You seemly awfully sure about this.\"\n \"I saw your mother when she lived in the Otherworld. I have seen her in this world. She\u0027s the same woman.\"\n \"You\u0027re lying.\"\n \"By the power that binds us, you know I am not.\"\n He was right. He couldn\u0027t lie to me - not so openly, at least. I knew that, and acknowledging that forced me to put my own world into a new perspective. It might explain why my mother hated the Otherworld so much. Why she and Roland had been adamant about instilling that hate in me, making sure I could never have any empathy with the gentry or anything else from that world.\n I swallowed and realized I was on the verge of tears. God. That would probably blow the show of strength I always tried to hold around these guys. We needed to get through this interview. \"So, are you saying that\u0027s why Roland eventually killed him? To protect me?\"\n \"Among other things. Storm King\u0027s invasion was imminent. He had come to claim you. Roland Markham killed him, both saving you and halting Storm King\u0027s plans.\"\n \"So Dorian was telling the - wait a minute. He knew! That bastard. He sat there and fed me that stuff about Storm King, knowing who I was!\"\n \"Everyone knows who you are, mistress,\" said Nandi.\n \"It\u0027s pretty recent, though,\" added Finn, seeing the look on my face. \"Came out only a couple of weeks ago. The same time everyone learned your real name.\"\n \"How?\" I glared at Volusian. He had known who I was this whole time. \"Did you tell them?\"\n \"No.\"\n \"Then why didn\u0027t you tell me before this? Why didn\u0027t any of you tell me when this came out?\"\n They stared.\n \"Because you did not ask us,\" replied Nandi.\n \"Yes,\" agreed Volusian. \"Had you asked us, \u0027Am I Storm King\u0027s daughter?\u0027 we would have gladly - \"\n \"Oh, shut up.\" I rubbed my eyes. I wanted to sleep. I wanted to sleep forever and forget all this. But I had miles to go before I slept, just like in the Robert Frost poem. \"If everyone thought Storm King was so great, then why are they all coming after me? Shouldn\u0027t I be some kind of hero? Instead they want to kill me.\"\n \"Most aren\u0027t trying to kill you, unfortunately. They\u0027re trying to bed you, mistress.\"\n \"Why?\"\n \"Probably because of the prophecy,\" said Nandi.\n \"Prophecy,\" I said dryly. \"Wonderful. Now there\u0027s a prophecy.\"\n \"Mistress,\" she said hastily, \"had you asked us if there was a prophecy - \"\n \"Yeah, yeah. I know. What\u0027s this one say? That I\u0027m a good lay?\"\n Finn hesitated. \"Well...it says Storm King\u0027s vision will be carried out through his daughter\u0027s first son. That the human world will be reconquered.\"\n \"You\u0027re kidding.\" Oh, God, I wanted to sleep.\n \"When they found out you didn\u0027t have kids yet, everyone - well, every guy - wanted to get in on the action. Being the one to father Storm King\u0027s heir would be a pretty big deal.\"\n \"Likewise,\" added Volusian, \"the prophecy says Storm King\u0027s daughter will clear the way for her son. Being your consort would carry great prestige.\"\n \"Hey, I\u0027m not clearing the way for any invasion. Not that I believe in prophecies. Not that I believe in any of this! In fact, that prophecy proves how stupid this all is. I wouldn\u0027t turn against my own kind.\"\n I swear Volusian smiled. \"Yes, but which people truly are your own kind? Your loyalties are now divided.\"\n My anger flared. \"No. Even if this is true and I am the daughter of the biggest gentry badass ever, I know where my loyalties are. I\u0027m human. I act human. I have no gentry powers.\"\n \"As you say, mistress.\"\n \"Get out of here. All of you. None of this is true. I\u0027ll talk to my parents and clear this up.\"\n Volusian bowed. \"A wise idea, mistress.\"\n I said the words to send them away and then lay on my bed. The storm had quieted outside, but one of my own raged inside me. I wanted to shut down my feelings. I wanted to forget all of this, because it wasn\u0027t true. It couldn\u0027t be. I wanted to take one of the prescription sleeping pills, but I didn\u0027t need Roland\u0027s warnings to know how stupid that would be. If every gentry was suddenly hot to get me pregnant, I couldn\u0027t let my guard down.\n I shouldn\u0027t have been able to sleep. Not after fighting gentry and seeing a girl run back to them. Not after learning my one-night stand was a kitsune. Not after discovering that I could very well be something I hated. Something that made me question everything I\u0027d ever believed in.\n No, I shouldn\u0027t have been able to sleep at all, but my body knew better as tiredness flowed over me. My body knew I\u0027d been up all night, that I\u0027d fought and been injured. And most important, it knew my fight wasn\u0027t over. Not by a long shot.\n \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/storm-born-dark-swan-1/page-11.html","bookId":2038,"book":{"id":2038,"title":"Storm Born (Dark Swan #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Dark Swan Series Book 1: Storm Born \n Storm Born is a supernatural, romance and fantasy novel written by American author Richelle Mead.
