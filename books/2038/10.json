{"id":109177,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"By my count, we\u0027d spent a little over two hours at Dorian\u0027s and almost an hour getting there. That did not please me. At this rate, we might not get home until dawn in our world. If we made it home. Dorian\u0027s servant, Gawyn, looked like he was about a hundred years old. No, wait. Actually, that\u0027d be pretty young for one of the gentry. Okay. He looked about a millennium old. I don\u0027t know. He was just old, plain and simple. His gray hair fell almost to his ankles, and as soon as I saw him hobble forward, I suddenly envisioned us taking another three hours to get to Aeson\u0027s, despite how close Dorian and the spirits claimed it was. \"He\u0027s ancient,\" I whispered to Dorian. \"And he seems kind of...out of it.\" Gawyn was currently telling Wil what lovely legs he had, despite the fact that Wil had none in spirit form. I wasn\u0027t entirely sure if Gawyn even realized Wil was male. \"His mind will be razor sharp when it comes to Aeson\u0027s castle. As for speed, I\u0027ll give you horses. You look like you could ride a number of things exceptionally well.\" I ignored the innuendo, mostly thinking how it\u0027d been years since I\u0027d been on a horse - not counting my earlier capture. Horses had never done much for me. I didn\u0027t get why little girls wanted ponies. If I did more riding tonight, I\u0027d likely be sore as hell tomorrow. Once my weapons were returned, we set out. Dorian waved us off, telling me he\u0027d be looking forward to my next visit. I stayed professional, simply thanking him for his help. I think this delighted him more than any other reaction could have. The horses did give us more speed than walking and were the best I could have hoped for in a world without mechanical transportation. The horse I rode was midnight black with a small white star on its nose. Gawyn\u0027s appeared to be a palomino. The spirits and Wil merely drifted in our wakes. In the darkness, I could just barely see Gawyn glancing over at me. \"So you\u0027re Eugenie Markham. The Dark Swan.\" \"So they say.\" \"I met your father once.\" \"Oh?\" I didn\u0027t bother making the father-stepfather clarification. \"Great man.\" \"You think so?\" \"Absolutely. I know some don\u0027t think so...but, well, you should be proud.\" \"Thank you. I am.\" Gawyn said no more, and I pondered his words, feeling kind of surprised. Considering what Dorian had told me, I hadn\u0027t expected Roland to have fans in the Otherworld. Then again, Dorian had also said that some - what was her name? Maiwenn? - had opposed Storm King. They might very well view Roland as a hero. We traveled in relative silence after that, broken occasionally when Finn would happily spout about what a great party Dorian had had. Like before, we crossed in and out of the various kingdoms and their climatic changes. I still felt like we traveled in circles. More than once, Gawyn called us to a halt, scratched his head, and mumbled to himself. I didn\u0027t find that reassuring. At one point, he led us off the trail and into a forest, and I hoped one of my minions would speak up if we\u0027d gotten completely lost. Everything was tropically warm and flourishing here, so presumably we rode in the Alder Land again. Gawyn came to a stop. \"Here,\" he said. I looked around. Night insects sang in the trees around us, and the smell of dirt, fresh growth, and decaying plants permeated the air. It had been dark before, but now the canopy of leaves blocked out even starlight. Gawyn climbed off his horse, nearly falling into a heap on the ground. I started to get down and help him, but he soon righted himself. He walked a few paces forward and then slammed his foot against the ground. A hard, solid sound answered back. I dismounted as well. \"What is that?\" Volusian, back in a legged form, walked over. \"A door of sorts. Built into the ground.\" \"Yes,\" said Gawyn triumphantly. \"Built for sieges. But never used anymore.\" \"Does it lead into Aeson\u0027s fortress thing?\" I asked. \"To the cellar. Stairs from the cellar lead up to the kitchen. From the kitchen, you take the servants\u0027 stairs - \" \"Whoa, hang on.\" I wanted to make sure I had it all. Volusian created blue flame to cast light, and we drew a map in a clear spot of dirt based on Gawyn\u0027s recollections. I might have doubted his memories, but he spoke with certainty, and he had managed to lead us to this obscure place. Maybe Dorian had been right in the \"razor sharp\" assessment. When Gawyn felt we had the directions to the residential wing memorized, he told us he wouldn\u0027t join us. He would wait here to tell Dorian what became of us. That was fine by me. I didn\u0027t really regard Gawyn as a battle asset - or Wil, for that matter. Unlike the old man, however, the ghostly conspiracy theorist didn\u0027t take being left behind so well. \"But I told you, I need to reassure her - \" \"No,\" I said firmly. \"I let you come this far, and you almost ruined things with those riders. Now you wait. If Jasmine\u0027s scared, she\u0027ll hold on a few more minutes until we bring her out to you.\" I worried I\u0027d have to bind him - I could actually do it since he was here in spirit, not in body - but it didn\u0027t come to that. He conceded, so I entered the trapdoor with just my minions in tow. \"Truly,\" remarked Nandi as we entered a darkened tunnel, \"it is amazing that you have not died yet, mistress.\" \"Well, hang in there. The night is young.\" Volusian provided light again, and we let it guide us along a stone-encased tunnel that smelled damp. Rats ran by at one point. Finn had been right. Apparently the Otherworld did have its share of animals and vermin. When the tunnel sloped upward, I knew we had reached the end. A wooden door in the ceiling marked our next gateway. I asked the spirits to go into an insubstantial form. Hitherto, they\u0027d walked along looking very human. I needed them obscured now. Compliant, all three shifted to what looked like a fine mist surrounding me. I pushed open the door and climbed out, finding myself in a small enclosed space. The mist that was Volusian glowed once more, and I made out the shapes of bags and boxes. If Gawyn was right about this attaching to the kitchen, then those containers probably contained food or other supplies. Twenty feet in front of me, a doorway was outlined in light shining through from the other side. I walked up about ten steps and gingerly opened the door. I now stood in a kitchen, a very rustic one compared to my own, but completely on par with what I\u0027d seen at Dorian\u0027s place. All was quiet. \"Where is everyone?\" I murmured. \"It\u0027s late now,\" Finn whispered back. \"No one\u0027s hungry. And Aeson\u0027s not into the party scene as much as Dorian.\" We found the servants\u0027 stairwell exactly where Gawyn had said it would be. Unfortunately, when I opened the door, I found a servant there, just coming down. We stared at each other stupidly, and I had only a heartbeat to decide how to handle him. I wielded both gun and athame. In another state of mind, I probably would have just killed him. But something held me back. Maybe it was Dorian. Maybe it was seeing his people and having to acknowledge they were more than just a faceless mob. Whatever it was, I chose not to kill this time. I reached out, grabbed the guy, and gave him a hard jolt to the head with my fist and the butt of my gun. His eyes rolled back, and he collapsed to the floor. Once he had been safely deposited in the cellar, we continued on our way. We encountered no one else on the stairs, nor in the magnificent hallway it led us to. Enormous stone pillars supported the high ceiling, and rich oil paintings of various landscapes turned the walls into seas of living color. We had reached the residential wing, just as Gawyn had said. If my other intelligence was correct, we\u0027d find Jasmine Delaney behind one of the many doors lining the hall. Fortunately, housekeeping had decided to leave open all of the unoccupied rooms. Sticking my head inside a few, I could see no one had occupied them in awhile. The beds were stripped of covers, and dust coated everything. Only two doors were actually closed. In some ways, that made my job easier. Yet, I might have enjoyed the buildup of opening a few false doors before the big payoff. Weapons readied, I opened the first one. It led to a bedroom almost bigger than Dorian\u0027s, but no one was inside. All was dark and still. A smoldering fire provided the only source of movement. Pausing a moment, I admired the wall tapestries and canopied bed. It had a nice layout, almost circular, complete with adjacent rooms and high ceilings. It made my bedroom at home look like a closet. \"One left,\" I muttered, slipping back out. We turned down the hall and approached the only other closed doorway. Unless Jasmine was locked in a dungeon, we should find her here, according to what we\u0027d heard. I reached for the handle, then hesitated. \"You open it, Volusian.\" Some of the mist coalesced into physical form. Once solid, Volusian slowly opened the door and peered in. It looked dark. I started to move forward, but he held up a warning hand. \"No, there\u0027s something - \" Light flared on, and suddenly we were under attack. I tried to back out of the room, but someone grabbed me, pulling me inside. With me at risk, the other minions poured into the room. They had no choice, their preemptive orders always demanding they look to my safety. This was a bedroom, like the other one, but seven men stood here, armed with weapons and magic. I fired at the one who had grabbed me, aiming for the face and neck now that I knew what little effect I\u0027d had on Dorian\u0027s people. It was bloody and messy, but I felt pretty sure even the best healing magic would have a tough time fixing that guy up. Once free of him, I turned on the next one who came at me. He was smart enough to strike out at my gun hand, attempting to neutralize that threat. I slashed at him with the other hand, the one holding the athame. He flinched at the feel of iron, and I used that momentary weakness to grab him and shove him into the wall with my elbow. He collapsed to the floor, and a sharp kick to the gut made sure he stayed down. I saw the spirits engaged in battle nearby, shoving and fighting with a strength that was literally inhuman. Two other men had been subdued or killed by them, and they now fought a third. That left two. One lunged at me, and I shot him, the gun\u0027s report loud in the small room. He fell backward, and I fired again, still not trusting gentry healing on their own turf. I started to look for the last guy when I heard a small whimper on the far side of the room. I turned, pausing. It was her. Jasmine Delaney. She was smaller and slighter than I\u0027d thought she\u0027d be. A long white gown covered her body, and she wrapped its voluminous folds around herself as she huddled in the corner. Lank, reddish blond hair nearly covered her face, but it couldn\u0027t hide her eyes. They were enormous and gray, filled with fear. They stood out sharply against her pale, gaunt face. Seeing my gaze upon her, she cringed further. Anger boiled within me. And pity. I knew she was fifteen, but in that moment, she looked about ten. She was a child. And she was trapped here, taken against her will. Hotter and fiercer my rage grew. I needed to make her captor pay, to let him know he couldn\u0027t just - My moment of emotion cost me. In those seconds I\u0027d spent staring at her, I\u0027d lost the last man. I felt a blade at my throat and realized I\u0027d let him sneak up behind me. \"If you want to live,\" he said, \"drop your weapons and call off your servants.\" I didn\u0027t really think I\u0027d live if I did that, but I was pretty sure I wouldn\u0027t if I didn\u0027t. So I did as he asked. Yet, it wasn\u0027t entirely clear to me what this one guy could really do alone. A moment later, I had my answer as another man entered. Immediately, I knew he was Aeson. For one thing, the others had been dressed in a sort of uniform. He was not. He wore deep burgundy pants tucked into thigh-high boots made of black leather. A shirt of black silk clothed his upper body, billowing and gleaming. His gray-streaked brown hair was pulled back in a short ponytail, and a circlet of gold sat on his head. His face was long and narrow, with a mouth destined for good sneers. Arrogant or not, Dorian had never worn a crown in his own keep, I realized. There had been no need. His kingship was obvious to all. Two guards followed Aeson, and upon seeing the situation, he sent one for backup. And here we\u0027d been doing so well in evening the odds. \"If I\u0027d realized you would decimate my men in minutes, I would have had the whole garrison up here,\" Aeson remarked. He leaned toward me, touching my cheek. \"It really is you. Eugenie Markham. I can\u0027t believe I finally have you.\" I tried to squirm from that touch, but I had nowhere to go, not with a blade at my throat. My minions waited, tense, willing to do whatever I asked. Yet, I feared unleashing them might put Jasmine at risk - and my own throat. \"You have her,\" said a shaking voice from the hall. \"I did what I said. Now give me Jasmine.\" Moving my eyes, I stared in astonishment. Wil floated in the doorway. He must have followed us after all. He looked at Aeson expectantly. An uneasy feeling built up within me, and everything clicked into place. \"You traitorous son of a bitch!\" Ignoring my outrage, Wil turned pleading eyes to Aeson. \"Please. I brought you Eugenie. I kept my part of the deal.\" \"Yes,\" said Aeson without even looking at the other man. \"You did. And I will keep my word - momentarily.\" He kept studying me like I was some kind of treasure or artifact. Like I was the eighth wonder of the world. I appreciated the boost to my ego, but the look in his eyes was actually kind of creeping me out. \"Aeson - \" tried Wil again. \"Shut up,\" snapped the king, still staring at me. The hand on my cheek slipped down and cupped my chin. He smiled, but it was a cold smile, one that didn\u0027t meet his eyes. In the corner, I heard Jasmine make a distraught sound. \"After all this time, after so much waiting, I can finally beget the heir.\" The statement was so ludicrous as to simply bounce off of me without comprehension. \"Either kill me or let me go. I hate these idiotic soliloquies.\" The entranced look on his face suddenly sharpened, and he blinked. \"You...you have no idea, do you?\" When I didn\u0027t answer, he started laughing so hard, I thought tears would form in his eyes. \"I\u0027ve tried so hard to get you, and you never even knew. You really don\u0027t know.\" \"Know what?\" I asked impatiently. \"Who your father is.\" I didn\u0027t really appreciate the Star Wars�Cesque routine. \"Roland Markham is my father. And the next time I see him, we\u0027re going to come back and kick your ass together. If I don\u0027t do it now.\" \"The next time you see him, you should ask him for the truth about you and Storm King.\" \"I don\u0027t have anything to do with Storm King.\" \"He\u0027s your father, girl. Roland Markham is a murderer and a thief. How could you not have known?\" He might as well have been speaking a foreign language. \"Maybe because you\u0027re insane. And because I\u0027m human.\" \"Are you? Funny. You function in this world as easily as one of the shining ones. I\u0027ve never met a human who could.\" \"Maybe I\u0027m gifted.\" I had on my bitch-bravado face, but his words were sneaking into me. I\u0027ve heard that the soul often recognizes truth when it hears it, even if the mind does not. Maybe that was what was happening. My logical self was still being stubborn, but something...something in his words tickled the back of my mind. It was like some image lay there, covered in a black veil, waiting for me to lift it. \"You are gifted. More than you know.\" He brushed my hair out of my face. \"Soon I will give you the greatest gift of your life. I\u0027ll redeem you for being a blood traitor.\" \"Shut up.\" The keres had called me a blood traitor too. \"You don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about.\" \"Then why do you look so pale? Admit it. You\u0027ve always known. You\u0027ve always been alone.\" \"Everyone feels alone.\" \"Not like you do. Rest easy, though. You won\u0027t be lonely much longer. I would have taken you to my bed even if you were ugly, but now that I\u0027ve seen you - \" There were a lot of ways to have your maniacal tirade cut short, but being attacked by a fox was a new one. I didn\u0027t even know where it came from. One minute, Aeson was babbling on about having his way with me, and the next, a red fox was leaping out at him, claws and teeth bared. I\u0027d never thought of a fox as a really dangerous animal, but this one looked lethal. It was the size of a German shepherd, and it hit Aeson like a tank. Its claws left scratches on his face. The guard holding me released me to help his master, and I retrieved my gun. I fired on him just as he was about to pry the fox from Aeson. It wasn\u0027t a killing shot, but it distracted him, halting his progress. I grabbed the wounded guard and threw him as far as the difference in our body weights would allow. He collapsed into a pile, and I shot him again. I turned toward Aeson to check the fox\u0027s progress, but the fox was no longer holding the king down. Kiyo was. My mouth dropped open. Kiyo. The black hair curled behind his ears, and I could see his muscles straining as he struggled with Aeson, his hands wrapped around the king\u0027s throat. Fire flared up from Aeson\u0027s fingertips, and I heard Kiyo grunt in response. I started to go to him without conscious thought, but he yelled at me to get Jasmine. Jasmine. Of course. The reason I was here. I dragged my eyes from the face I\u0027d been obsessing on for the past week and approached the girl in the corner. I didn\u0027t think she could move any farther against the wall, yet she seemed to do so with each step I took. \"Jasmine,\" I said, leaning over and trying to sound gentle despite the panic coursing through me. \"I\u0027m a friend. I\u0027m here to help you - \" With those pathetic eyes and worn features, I\u0027d expected some difficulty in getting her on her feet. What I did not expect was for her to suddenly leap out and flail at me with both hands. \"Noooo!\" she screamed, her shrill voice grating against my ears. I recoiled, not because of the threat she represented but because of the damage I could potentially cause her. \"Aeson!\" She ran to the struggling men and started beating fists on Kiyo\u0027s back. I suspected they had about the same effect as a fly landing on him. He transformed into a fox, and her blows fell on Aeson instead. I reached for her in that moment of surprise, but she was too small and too fast. She slipped away from me and everyone else in the room, and ran out the door before any of us could stop her. \"Jasmine!\" I yelled, my cries echoed by Wil as I ran to the door. Kiyo and Aeson still fought, and some distant part of me noted how Kiyo slipped in and out of fox and human forms as Aeson used fire magic against him. \"Eugenie,\" gasped Kiyo, \"get out of here. Now.\" \"Jasmine - \" I began. \"The girl is gone, mistress,\" said Volusian. \"The kitsune is right. We need to get out of here. Cut your losses.\" \"No.\" I stuck my head out the door. Jasmine was not in sight. Over a dozen or so guards running down the hall were, however. \"Eugenie!\" It was Kiyo again. \"Run!\" \"Yes, Storm Daughter,\" laughed Aeson, blood running out of his nose. \"Run home. Ask Roland Markham who your father is.\" \"You bastard - \" I wanted to lunge at him, to help Kiyo, but Finn grabbed me. \"Jump now. Back to your world.\" The pounding boots in the hall were almost upon us. \"I can\u0027t. Not from here. I don\u0027t have an anchor.\" \"Yes, you do.\" He glanced over at Wil, who hung there, translucent and utterly useless. If it had been up to me, I would have left Wil and his betraying ass here to be destroyed, but suddenly he had a purpose. Seeing my uncertain look, Kiyo said, \"I\u0027ll go as soon as you do. They\u0027re here!\" And they were. Men pouring into the room. I probably shouldn\u0027t have cared what happened to Kiyo, but I did. I wanted him to get out of this alive. I wanted to find Jasmine and bring her away. But the best I could do now was save my own skin. Invoking Hecate, I shifted my senses away from this world, reaching out to my own. While doing so, my will grabbed ahold of a startled Wil, dragging his spirit with me. A hard transition like that, without a crossroads or thin spot, theoretically could have dumped me anywhere in the human world. But I had Wil\u0027s spirit in tow. It had no choice but to snap back to his physical body, out in the Sonora Desert. If I was strong enough. \"Follow!\" I yelled to the minions. Or maybe it was to Kiyo. I didn\u0027t really know. The world shifted, my senses blurring. Crossing worlds in a convenient spot was like crossing through a wall made out of plastic sheeting. It was thin, and it took some struggling and clawing, but you could eventually get through. Jumping without a normal crossover spot, however? Well, that was like breaking through a brick wall.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/storm-born-dark-swan-1/page-10.html","bookId":2038,"book":{"id":2038,"title":"Storm Born (Dark Swan #1)","description":"Storyline: Dark Swan Series Book 1: Storm Born Storm Born is a supernatural, romance and fantasy novel written by American author Richelle Mead.
