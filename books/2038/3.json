{"id":109170,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"I\u0027d been people-watching for almost an hour, so I saw him as soon as he walked in. It was hard not to. The eyes of a few other women in the bar showed that I wasn\u0027t the only one who\u0027d noticed. He was tall and broad-shouldered, nicely muscled but not over the top in some crazy Arnold Schwarzenegger way. He wore khakis with a navy blue T-shirt tucked into them. His black hair was not quite to his chin, and he had it tucked behind his ears. His eyes were large and dark, set in a smoothly chiseled face with perfect, golden-tanned skin. There was some mix of ethnicities going on there, I suspected, but none I could discern. Whatever the combo, it worked. Extremely well. \"Hey, is anyone sitting here?\" He nodded at the chair beside me. It was the only empty one at the bar. I shook my head, and he sat down. He didn\u0027t say anything else, and the only other time I heard him speak was to order a margarita. After that, he seemed content just to people-watch, like me. And honestly, it was a great place to do it. Alejandro\u0027s was right next to a midlevel hotel and drew in patrons and tourists from all sides of the socioeconomic scale. TVs showed sporting events or news or whatever the bartender felt like putting on. A few trivia machines sat at the other end of the bar. Music - sometimes live, but not tonight - forced the TVs to have closed-captioning, and dancing people crowded the small space among the tables. It was humanity at its best. Teeming with life, alcohol, mindless entertainment, and bad pick-up lines. I liked to come here when I wanted to be alone without being alone. I liked it better when drunk, stupid guys left me alone. I wasn\u0027t sure about articulate, good-looking ones. One nice thing I soon discovered was that with Tall, Dark, and Handsome sitting next to me, no losers dared approach. But he wasn\u0027t talking to me either, and after a while, I realized I\u0027d kind of like him to - not that I\u0027d have any clue what to say back. With the glances he kept giving me, I think he felt the same way. I didn\u0027t know. A sort of tension built up between us as I nursed my Corona, each of us waiting for something. When it finally came, he started it. \"You\u0027re edible.\" Not the opening I\u0027d been expecting. \"I beg your pardon?\" \"Your perfume. It\u0027s like...like violets and sugar. And vanilla. I suppose it\u0027s weird to think violets are edible, huh?\" \"Not so weird as a guy actually knowing what violets smell like.\" It was also weird that he could even smell it. I\u0027d put it on about twelve hours ago. With all the smoke and sweat around here, it was a surprise anyone\u0027s olfactory senses could function. He shot me a crooked grin, favoring me with a look that could only be described as smoky. I felt my pulse quicken a little. \"It\u0027s good to know what flowers are what. Makes it easier to send them. And impress women.\" I eyed him and then swirled the beer in my bottle. \"Are you trying to impress me?\" He shrugged. \"Mostly I\u0027m just trying to make conversation.\" I pondered that, deciding if I wanted to play this game or not. Wondering if I could. I smiled a little. \"What?\" he asked. \"I don\u0027t know. Just thinking about flowers. And impressing people. I mean, how strange is that we bring plant sex organs to people we\u0027re attracted to? What\u0027s up with that? It\u0027s a weird sign of affection.\" His dark eyes lit up, like he\u0027d just discovered something surprising and delightful. \"Is it any weirder than giving chocolate, which is supposed to be an aphrodisiac? Or what about wine? A \u0027romantic\u0027 drink that really just succeeds in lowering the other person\u0027s inhibitions.\" \"Hmm. It\u0027s like people are trying to be both subtle and blatant at the same time. Like, they won\u0027t actually go up and say, \u0027Hey, I like you, let\u0027s get together.\u0027 Instead, they\u0027re like, \u0027Here, have some plant genitalia and aphrodisiacs.\u0027\" I took a drink of the beer and propped my chin in my hand, surprised to hear myself going on. \"I mean, I don\u0027t have a problem with men or relationships or sex, but sometimes I just get so frustrated with games of human attraction.\" \"How so?\" \"It\u0027s all masked in posturing and ploys. There\u0027s no honesty. People can\u0027t just come up and express their attraction. It\u0027s got to be cleverly obscured with some stupid pick-up line or not-so-subtle gift, and I don\u0027t really know how to play those games so well. We\u0027re taught that it\u0027s wrong to be honest, like there\u0027s some kind of social stigma with it.\" \"Well,\" he considered, \"it can come out pretty crass sometimes. And let\u0027s not forget about rejection too. I think that adds to it. There\u0027s a fear there.\" \"Yeah, I guess. But being turned down isn\u0027t the worst thing in the world. And wouldn\u0027t that be easier than wasting an evening or - God forbid - months of dating? We should state our feelings and intentions openly. If the other person says \u0027fuck off,\u0027 well, then, deal. Move on.\" I suddenly eyed my beer bottle suspiciously. \"What\u0027s wrong?\" \"Just wondering if I\u0027m drunk. This is my first beer, but I think I\u0027m sounding a little unhinged. I don\u0027t usually talk this much.\" He laughed. \"I don\u0027t think you\u0027re unhinged. I actually agree with you.\" \"Yeah?\" He nodded and looked remarkably wise as he contemplated his answer. It made him even sexier. \"I agree, but I don\u0027t think most people take honesty well. They prefer the games. They want to believe the pretty lies.\" I finished off the last of the Corona. \"Not me. Give me honesty anytime.\" \"You mean that?\" \"Yes.\" I set the bottle down and looked at him. He was watching me intently now, and his look was smoky again, all darkness and sex and heat. I fell into that gaze, feeling the response of nerves in my lower body that I\u0027d thought were dormant. He leaned slightly forward. \"Well, then, here\u0027s honesty. I was really happy when I saw the empty seat by you. I think you\u0027re beautiful. I think seeing the bra underneath your shirt is dead sexy. I like the shape of your neck and the way those strands of hair lay against it. I think you\u0027re funny, and I think you\u0027re smart too. After just five minutes, I already know you don\u0027t let people screw around with you - which I also like. You\u0027re pretty fun to talk to, and I think you\u0027d be just as much fun to have sex with.\" He sat back in his chair again. \"Wow,\" I said, now noticing I\u0027d put on a white shirt over a black bra in my haste. Oops. \"That\u0027s a lot of honesty.\" \"Should I fuck off now?\" I played with the rim of the bottle. I took a deep breath. \"No. Not yet.\" He smiled and ordered us another round. Introductions seemed like the next logical step, and when his turn came, he told me his name was Kiyo. \"Kiyo,\" I repeated. \"Neat.\" He watched me, and after a moment, a smile danced over his mouth. A really nice mouth too. \"You\u0027re trying to figure me out.\" \"Figure you out how?\" \"What I am. Race. Ethnic group. Whatever.\" \"Of course not,\" I protested, even though I\u0027d been trying to do exactly that. \"My mother is Japanese, and my father is Latino. Kiyo is short for Kiyotaka.\" I scrutinized him, now understanding the large dark eyes and the tanned skin. Human genes were exquisite. I loved the way they blended. How cool, I thought, to have such a solid grip on your ancestry. I knew my mother had a lot of Greek and Welsh, but there was a mix of all sorts of other things there too. And as for my deadbeat father...well, I knew no more about his heritage than I knew anything else about him. For all intents and purposes, I was very much the mongrel the keres had called me earlier. I realized then I\u0027d been staring at Kiyo too long. \"I like the results,\" I finally said, which made him laugh again. He asked about my job, and I told him I worked in Web design. It wasn\u0027t entirely a lie. I\u0027d majored in it and in French. Both areas had turned out to be completely irrelevant to my job, though Lara swore having a Web site would drive up our business. We mostly relied on word of mouth now. When he told me he was a veterinarian, I said, \"No, you aren\u0027t.\" Those smoldering eyes widened in surprise. \"Why do you say that?\" \"Because...because you can\u0027t be. I just can\u0027t see it.\" Nor could I imagine telling Lara tomorrow: So I was in a bar last night and met this sexy veterinarian... No, those concepts somehow didn\u0027t go together. Veterinarians looked like Wil Delaney. \"It\u0027s God\u0027s truth,\" Kiyo swore, stirring his margarita. \"I even take my work home with me. I have five cats and two dogs.\" \"Oh, dear Lord.\" \"Hey, I like animals. It goes back to the honesty thing. Animals don\u0027t lie about how they feel. They want to eat, fight, and reproduce. If they like you, they show it. If they don\u0027t, they don\u0027t. They don\u0027t play games. Well, except maybe the cats. They\u0027re tricky sometimes.\" \"Yeah? What\u0027d you name all those cats?\" \"Death, Famine, Pestilence, War, and Mr. Whiskers.\" \"You named your cats after the riders of the apocal - wait. Mr. Whiskers?\" \"Well, there are only four horsemen.\" We talked for a while after that about whatever else came to mind. Some was serious, some humorous. He told me he was in town from Phoenix, which kind of disappointed me. Not local. We also talked about the people around us, our jobs, life, the universe, etc., etc. All the while I kept wondering how this had happened. Hadn\u0027t I just been noting how I lived outside of society? Yet, here I was, talking to a guy I\u0027d just met like I\u0027d known him for years. I barely recognized the words coming out of my own mouth. I didn\u0027t even recognize my body language: leaning into him as we talked, legs touching. He wore no cologne but smelled like he looked: darkness and sex and heat. And promises. Promises that said, Oh, baby, I can give you everything you\u0027ve ever wanted if you\u0027ll just give me the chance.... At one point, I leaned toward the bar to slide an empty bottle across it. As I did, I suddenly felt Kiyo\u0027s fingers brush my lower back where my shirt had ridden up. I flinched as electricity crackled through me at that slight, casual touch. \"Here\u0027s more honesty,\" he said in a low voice. \"I like this tattoo. A lot. Violets again?\" I nodded and sat back in my chair, but he didn\u0027t remove his hand. That tattoo was a chain of violets and leaves that spread across my lower back. A larger cluster of the flowers sat on my tailbone, and then smaller tendrils extended outward on both sides, almost to my hips. \"Violets have sort have become my patron flower,\" I explained, \"because of my eyes.\" He leaned forward, and I almost stopped breathing at how close his mouth was to mine. \"Wow. You\u0027re right. I\u0027ve never seen eyes that color.\" \"I\u0027ve got three more.\" \"Eyes?\" \"Tattoos.\" This got his interest. \"Where?\" \"They\u0027re covered by the shirt.\" I hesitated. \"You know anything about Greek mythology?\" He nodded. A cultured man. Cue swooning. I touched my upper right arm. My sleeve covered the skin. \"This one\u0027s a snake wrapped all the way around my arm. It\u0027s for Hecate, the goddess of magic and the crescent moon.\" What I didn\u0027t add was that Hecate guarded the crossroads between worlds. It was she who governed transitions to the Otherworld and beyond. This tattoo was my link to her, to facilitate my own journeys and call on her for help when needed. I moved to my upper left arm. \"This one\u0027s a butterfly whose wings wrap around and touch behind my arm. It\u0027s half black and half white.\" \"Psyche?\" he asked. \"Good guess.\" He really was cultured. The goddess Psyche was synonymous with the soul, which the butterfly represented in myth. \"Persephone.\" He nodded. \"Half black, half white. She lives half her life in this world and half in the Underworld.\" Not unlike my own life. Persephone guided transitions to the world of death. I didn\u0027t travel there myself, but I invoked her to send others across. \"She governs the dark moon. And back here\" - I tapped the spot behind me where my neck connected to my back - \"is a moon with an abstract woman\u0027s face in it. Selene, the full moon.\" Kiyo\u0027s dark eyes held intense interest. \"Why not one of the more common moon goddesses, then? Like Diana?\" I hesitated with my answer. In many ways, Diana would have served the same purpose. She, like Selene, was bound to the human world and could keep me grounded here when I needed it. \"The others are...solitary goddesses. Even Persephone, who\u0027s technically married. Diana\u0027s a virgin - she\u0027s alone too. But Selene...well, she doesn\u0027t get a lot of press anymore, but she was a more social goddess. A sexual goddess. She opens herself up to other people. And experiences. So I went with her. I just didn\u0027t think it\u0027d be healthy to be marked with three goddesses who were all alone.\" \"What about you? Are you alone, Eugenie?\" His voice was velvet against me, and I could have drowned in those eyes. They were like chocolate. Chocolate is an aphrodisiac. \"Aren\u0027t we all alone?\" I asked with a rueful smile. \"Yes. I think in the end, we all are, no matter what the songs and happy stories say. I guess it\u0027s just a matter of who we choose to be alone with.\" \"That\u0027s why I come here, you know. To be alone with other people. There\u0027s isolation in a crowd. You\u0027re hidden. Safe.\" He looked around at the buzzing, moving sea of people in the bar. They were like a wall surrounding us. There but not there. \"Yes. Yes, I suppose that\u0027s true.\" \"Isn\u0027t that why you\u0027re here too?\" He glanced back down at me, his expression a little less sexual and a bit more pensive. \"I don\u0027t know. I\u0027m not sure. I guess maybe I\u0027m here because of you.\" I didn\u0027t have any quick retorts for that, so I started playing with the bottle again. The bartender asked if I wanted another, and I shook my head. Kiyo touched my shoulder. \"You want to dance?\" I was pretty sure I hadn\u0027t danced since high school, but some force compelled me to agree. We stepped out into a crowd of very bad dancers. Most were just sort of floundering around to a fast song with a heavy beat that I\u0027d never heard before. Kiyo and I weren\u0027t much better. But when a slower song came on, he wrapped me to him, pressing us together as close as two people could be. Well, almost as close. I couldn\u0027t ever remember anything like this happening with a guy I\u0027d just met, a desire for someone I actually wanted and not just someone who was available. His body felt hard and perfect against mine, and my flesh kept concocting ways to touch his. I was already picturing him naked, imagining what it would be like to have his body move against and inside of mine. What was going on with me here? The images were so vivid and real, it was a wonder my feelings weren\u0027t written across my face. So I didn\u0027t really mind when he slid his hand up the back of my neck and brought his mouth down to kiss me. It wasn\u0027t a tentative kiss either. No first-date kisses here. It was the kind of kiss that meant business, the kind of kiss that said, I want to consume every inch of you and hear you scream my name. I\u0027d never really made out in a public place, but it seemed kind of a trivial concern as that kiss burned between us, our tongues and lips exploring the contours of each other\u0027s mouths. But when his other hand slid up and cupped my breast, even I was surprised. \"Hey,\" I said, breaking off slightly. \"There are people around.\" Amusing, I thought a moment later, that I was less concerned about him doing it than being seen doing it. He kissed the side of my neck, just below my ear, and when he spoke, his words heated my skin. \"People only notice if you make a big deal about it.\" I let him kiss me again and didn\u0027t say anything else about the hand that continued to stroke the curve of my breast and tease my nipple into hardness beneath the shirt. His other hand slid down to my ass and ground me closer to him, letting me feel exactly what was underneath his jeans. The fact that we were doing this in public suddenly made it a lot sexier. I let out a small, trembling sigh and then broke away from the kiss again. Only this time, it wasn\u0027t because of any prudish feelings. It was from need. My body\u0027s suddenly urgent and excruciating need. \"Are you staying next door?\" I asked, indicating the hotel adjacent to the bar. \"No. Out at the Monteblanca.\" I let surprise show on my face. That was in the region near where I lived, in the Santa Catalina foothills. \"That\u0027s not a hotel. That\u0027s a resort. A really nice one. Veterinarians must make a lot.\" He smiled and brushed his lips against my cheek. \"You want to see it?\" \"Yes,\" I told him. \"I certainly do.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/storm-born-dark-swan-1/page-3.html","bookId":2038,"book":{"id":2038,"title":"Storm Born (Dark Swan #1)","description":"Storyline: Dark Swan Series Book 1: Storm Born Storm Born is a supernatural, romance and fantasy novel written by American author Richelle Mead.
