{"id":4298,"no":61,"title":"CHAPTER X.","content":"“Brightly shines the vest o’er his widow’d heart, The manly brow, by early sorrow touch’d, Is bare. The jewelled cap and graceful plume, In his worser hand, his martial’s baton In the right, he passed mid a people’s Sympathy!” At breakfast, Lord L. requested that his daughters would be ready to accompany him to town, on an early day which he named. He was evidently ill at ease at Lodore: he made every effort, however, to conceal such feelings, and assigned the following commonplace[105] reason, for the hasty departure he meditated. He had, he said, already issued cards, for what he intended should be a very brilliant affair; given for the purpose of introducing his daughters at home, to what he considered his own private circle, previous to their public presentation at court. Ere Lord L. and his daughters departed, Mrs. Montgomery discharged the painful duty she had imposed upon herself, of informing Lord L. of every particular of Henry’s very improper conduct, respecting his attachment to his cousin. Lord L. was, at first, distressed and alarmed; but, on questioning his daughter, was so perfectly satisfied by her assurances of indifference to Henry himself, and repugnance to his addresses, that he determined to treat the young man’s presumption, with the contempt it merited. Should St. Aubin,[106] however, in future, persevere in making himself troublesome; his Lordship would, of course, forbid him his house. A passing visit to Beech-park, prolonged by the delight the girls took in exploring its groves, so far retarded our travellers, that they did not arrive in London, till the very day, on the evening of which the projected ball was to take place. The preparations, however, had gone on in pursuance of former orders, and every thing was found ready. Lord L., the moment he had welcomed his daughters beneath the paternal roof, went out to call on the son of his old friend, and endeavour to induce him to join the family party at dinner, preparatory to the gaieties of the evening. No card had been sent; for, on account of[107] all the strange reports that were current, Lord L. had determined to make the invitation in person, should he find Fitz-Ullin in a state to accept it.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/795/59045.html","bookId":145,"book":{"id":145,"title":"First Love","description":"简介： 小说中21岁的季娜伊达是一个美丽美女，出生没落贵族，行动专横并动人。她的四周从来不缺一群崇拜者，她同这些人时常聚会并捉弄他们，但内心中深感厌恶，并渴望一个能够在精神上给于慰藉和依赖的男人。16岁的沃洛佳，故事中的我，对季娜伊达始终带有着纯真、热情的感情，...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Celebrity Biographies","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/795","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM"}}
