Indeed, she will, I make no doubt, rejoice in having found such a friend and protector for her child.” \\n\\n \\n\\n [173] \\n\\n \\n\\n “Your lordship’s good opinion is truly flattering!” replied Edmund, “and I hope, when the well being, and I may, perhaps, say happiness through life, of a young and innocent being, are committed to my keeping, I may not undertake the charge, with light or careless ideas of its responsibility.” \\n\\n \\n\\n So, as Frances would say, they really are going to be married! \\n\\n \\n\\n “With your principles, Captain Montgomery, there can be little doubt of your fulfilling well any duties you take upon yourself. If the boy is tolerably well disposed, he has every chance, in such hands, of turning out an honour to his profession: though it can fall to the lot of but few to adorn it quite as brilliantly as Captain Montgomery has done!” \\n\\n \\n\\n Lord Arandale is speaking of young Oswald, Sir Archibald’s boy; and the letter which he[174] has just finished folding, he is, we perceive, now directing to Lady Oswald, the boy’s mother. In fact, Edmund had applied to his lordship the night before, for the purpose of having it thus arranged. He felt a delicacy, as a total stranger, in obtruding his offers of service on Lady Oswald, and had requested Lord Arandale to take, (on the plea of his long friendship for Sir Archibald,) nominally, the lead in the business, by addressing a letter to her ladyship, saying, that he had now an opportunity of placing her son in the Euphrasia frigate, commanded by Captain Montgomery; and stating that the attending circumstances were particularly favourable, as young Oswald would thus have an opportunity of forming a desirable intimacy with his cousin, Lord Ormond, who was the particular friend of Captain Montgomery; and of becoming[175] personally known to Lord Fitz-Ullin, who, it could not be doubted, would take an interest in the advancement of so near a connexion, when thus placed within the sphere of his observation. On the strength of a lady not understanding those matters, the gentlemen ventured to enclose a bank bill for a moderate sum, as advance of pay to Mr. Oswald for his fitting out. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/795/59018.html","bookId":145,"book":{"id":145,"title":"First Love","description":"简介： 小说中21岁的季娜伊达是一个美丽美女，出生没落贵族，行动专横并动人。她的四周从来不缺一群崇拜者，她同这些人时常聚会并捉弄他们，但内心中深感厌恶，并渴望一个能够在精神上给于慰藉和依赖的男人。16岁的沃洛佳，故事中的我，对季娜伊达始终带有着纯真、热情的感情，...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Celebrity Biographies","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/795","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM"}}
