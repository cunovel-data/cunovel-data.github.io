{"id":111710,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"I found Damon dancing with Hilda, ushering her around the dance floor with the lightest touch. Wherever his fingers touched she bent, curling into him a trifle more than was acceptable and falling against him more than was necessary. Other girls looked on enviously, clearly hoping to dance with him next. He pretended to devote all his attention to the poor girl, but glanced up just long enough to shoot me a dazzling smile.\\n\\n I waited impatiently for the dance to end, wishing I could compel the musicians to stop. But whatever Damon\u0027s powers of compulsion, mine were severely lacking thanks to my meager diet.\\n\\n As soon as the last beat was played, I marched up to my brother.\\n\\n \"Oh, I\u0027m sorry, did you want to... ?\" he asked, innocently, indicating Hilda. \"Because I\u0027m sure she will. If you\u0027d like her to.\"\\n\\n Hilda studied her dance card, the picture of confusion.\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s go get a drink,\" I said, taking him by the elbow.\\n\\n \"Exactly what I was thinking,\" he agreed, mock-seriously. He snapped his fingers, as if at a dog. \"Hilda... ?\"\\n\\n \"Leave her alone,\" I ordered.\\n\\n Damon rolled his eyes. \"Fine. A waiter will do just as well.\" But he allowed me to place an iron grip on his arm and guide him through the crowd, past the refreshment room, through a library and into a poorly lit study.\\n\\n \"What the hell are you doing here?\" I demanded the moment we were alone.\\n\\n \"Trying to enjoy myself,\" Damon said, throwing his hands up in mock exasperation. He dropped his accent immediately. \"Did you see the spread? The salmon\u0027s from Scotland. And Adelina Patti is here, too - Father would have just died. Oh wait.\" He snapped his fingers. \"He did die. You murdered him, in fact.\"\\n\\n \"Only after he tried to kill us,\" I pointed out, clenching my fists.\\n\\n \"Correction: after he succeeded in shooting both of us. We\u0027re dead, brother.\" Damon grinned at me.\\n\\n He was circling me. Casually, as if he didn\u0027t mean to, as if he was just walking around idly, making conversation while admiring the decor. It reminded me of how he\u0027d paced the ring at the circus back in New Orleans, when Gallagher had forced him to fight the mountain lion. Damon picked up a small statuette and turned it over in his hands, but his eyes stayed locked on mine. I squared my shoulders, feeling the predator\u0027s response as he challenged my personal space.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m asking you again, Damon: What are you doing here?\"\\n\\n \"Same thing as you, brother. Starting a new life, far from home, and war, and tragedy, and all of those other things immigrants like us are escaping. New York is where the action is. I figured if it\u0027s good enough for my brother, it\u0027s good enough for me, too.\"\\n\\n \"So you did follow me,\" I said. \"How?\"\\n\\n \"You stink,\" Damon said. \"Don\u0027t act surprised! It\u0027s not just you. Everyone stinks. We\u0027re hunters, Stefan. About halfway up the coast, it wasn\u0027t hard to figure out where you decided to go after New Orleans. I just made sure I got here first. There isn\u0027t a train yet that can beat me on a horse. Well, several horses. A couple of them died of exhaustion. Like your poor, poor Mezzanotte.\"\\n\\n \"Why, Damon?\" I said, ignoring his casual cruelty. \"Why follow me here?\"\\n\\n Damon\u0027s eyes narrowed and a flash of rage shot through them, exploding from the hidden depths of his soul.\\n\\n \"I told you I was going to torment you for the eternity you blessed me with, Stefan. Did you think I would break my promise so quickly?\"\\n\\n I was used to Damon\u0027s fits of pique. His anger had always been like a summer storm, quick and violent, causing damage to anyone or anything nearby - and then it was over and he was buying a round at the tavern.\\n\\n But this fury was new, and it was all because of me.\\n\\n I averted my eyes so he couldn\u0027t see the pain and guilt written there. \"What do you want with Lydia? What does she have to do with anything?\"\\n\\n \"Ah, Lydia,\" Damon sighed, infusing his voice with pretend longing. \"Charming, isn\u0027t she? Definitely the best catch of the three sisters. Not that Margaret doesn\u0027t have her own charms, of course, but she\u0027s a bit sarcastic for my tastes, and, well, married.\" He shook his head. \"But then there\u0027s Bridget. Such a lively girl! Such verve!\"\\n\\n \"... anyone seen Stefan?\" As if on cue, we could both pick out her whining, childish soprano from four rooms away.\\n\\n \"... and such an irritating voice,\" Damon finished, wincing. \"First thing I would do, brother, is compel her to silence. You\u0027d be doing the world a favor.\"\\n\\n I clenched my jaw. \"You were obviously involved with the Sutherlands long before we crossed paths here.\"\\n\\n \"Oh was I?\" Damon asked. He put down the small statue he had been holding and turned it this way and that on the desk, as if deciding which way it looked best. \"Poor girl was getting soaked - did she tell you the story? She loves it. For all of her pretending to be hard-nosed, she\u0027s a weak-kneed romantic as bad as the rest of them. A sudden storm out of nowhere, a dry cab for Lydia... rich, rich Lydia... with a sheltered upbringing and open, welcoming family.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, you are a master of subtlety. Controlling men\u0027s fates,\" I said, rolling my eyes at Damon\u0027s preening.\\n\\n \"I am a master. Who do you think left Bridget for you to find?\" he demanded. He stuck his face toward my own so that our noses almost touched. \"Who do you think wounded her - just enough - for poor, old, predictable Stefan to find? Stefan, who\u0027s sworn off drinking from humans, who I just knew would rescue the damsel in distress rather than finish her off.\"\\n\\n A cold chill crept up my spine.\\n\\n \"And then of course I compelled the entire family to welcome you and take you in,\" he finished with a careless wave of his hand, as if it had been nothing.\\n\\n A sense of resignation and understanding flooded my body. Of course he had compelled the family. The Sutherlands\u0027 easy acceptance of me into their home had rankled me, and I should have realized earlier that something was hugely amiss. How did a man of Winfield\u0027s stature let a stranger, a vagrant, into his home, and never ask anything about his family or acquaintances? A man of his kind of wealth had to be careful about whom he allowed to get close. And Mrs. Sutherland - she was such a cautious mother, yet she allowed me to escort her and her daughter on a walk in the park. Though this was hardly the time, I couldn\u0027t help but wonder if her seeming affection for me had been true, or if it all had been due to Damon\u0027s Power.\\n\\n \"What do you want, Damon?\" I asked again. Here we were, back in the thick of it, but this time I understood just how dangerous my brother was and just how far he\u0027d go to get revenge on me.\\n\\n \"Nothing terrible, Stefan!\" he said, grinning and stepping back, throwing his hands in the air. \"But think of it! Me with Lydia wrapped around my finger. You with the adoring Bridget.... We\u0027ll marry the sisters and, just as you always hoped, we\u0027ll be brothers again for eternity - or at least as long as they live.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not marrying Bridget,\" I blurted out.\\n\\n \"Yes, you are,\" Damon said.\\n\\n \"No, I\u0027m not,\" I repeated. \"I\u0027m leaving New York. Tonight.\"\\n\\n \"You are staying here and marrying Bridget,\" Damon said, coming to within an inch of my face, \"or I will start to kill all the people in this place, one by one.\"\\n\\n He was deadly serious, all traces of cavalier, joking, devil-may-care Damon gone. The smoldering anger was back.\\n\\n \"You can\u0027t do that,\" I growled. \"Even you aren\u0027t strong enough to take down an entire ballroom.\"\\n\\n \"Oh really?\" He snapped his fingers over his shoulder. A maid appeared from the next room, as if waiting for his signal. She already had a kerchief tied around her neck from where he had fed on her previously. He gestured with his chin at the window, and she gamely went over and began to unbolt the latches.\\n\\n \"I can compel Bridget and her entire stupid entourage in there to go jump off a balcony,\" Damon growled.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t believe you,\" I said as calmly as I could. Only Lexi seemed able to control more than one person at once. And Damon wasn\u0027t nearly as old as she.\\n\\n \"Or I can stalk them one by one and rip their throats out,\" he offered instead. \"It makes no difference to me.\"\\n\\n The maid stepped up onto the sill and began to climb onto the rail.\\n\\n \"Bastard,\" I murmured, rushing over to grab the poor girl before she killed herself. \"Get out of here,\" I growled at her, unsure if I was compelling her or not. Suddenly she looked confused and scared, the spell broken. She bolted out of the room, sniffling.\\n\\n \"Why?\" I demanded when she had gone. \"Why do you want to marry Lydia? Why is it so important that I marry her sister?\"\\n\\n \"If I have to live forever, I might as well do it in style,\" Damon said, shrugging. \"I\u0027m sick of living from person to person, meal to meal, having no place to call home. When I marry Lydia, I\u0027ll be rich. A houseful of servants to attend to my every whim... to feed my every need,\" he leered. I wasn\u0027t sure he was just talking about blood. \"Or, I could just take the money and run. Either way, I\u0027ll be a lot better off than I am now. Winfield is swimming in money.\"\\n\\n \"Why involve me?\" I asked, feeling weary. \"Why not just go off and do whatever it is you need to do, ruining people\u0027s lives?\"\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s just say I have my reasons.\" Damon flashed me a harlequin\u0027s grin.\\n\\n I shook my head in exasperation. Just past the door of the study, a couple walked arm in arm through the library, in search of a quiet place to talk. Beyond them were the happy noises of the dancing throng, laughing conversations, the tap of heels on the floor. I watched distractedly, picking out Winfield\u0027s booming voice as he lectured someone on the basic tenets of capitalism.\\n\\n \"What will you do with them?\" I asked. With Damon as son-in-law, Winfield Sutherland\u0027s life expectancy had just been drastically reduced - and Lydia\u0027s as well.\\n\\n \"Once I have their money? Pfff. I don\u0027t know,\" Damon said, throwing his hand up in the air. \"I hear San Francisco is fairly exciting - or maybe I\u0027ll just go and take that grand tour in Europe you\u0027d always dreamed of.\"\\n\\n \"Damon - \" I began.\\n\\n \"Or I could just live here, like the king I do so want to be,\" he continued, cutting me off. \"Enjoying myself...\"\\n\\n I had a horrible image of Damon satisfying his every carnal desire in the Sutherland household.\\n\\n \"I won\u0027t let you do this,\" I said urgently.\\n\\n \"Why do you care?\" Damon asked. \"I mean, it wasn\u0027t me tearing through New Orleans.... What was your body count toward the end there, brother?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve changed,\" I pointed out, looking him in the eye.\\n\\n \"Yes, of course,\" he said. \"Just like that. Whatever could have... oh!\" He grinned. \"It\u0027s Lydia, isn\u0027t it? Once again following in my footsteps, brother. Everything I have you just want. Like Katherine.\"\\n\\n \"I never loved Katherine. Not the way you did.\"\\n\\n I was attracted to her, of course - who wouldn\u0027t have been? She was beautiful, charming, and a terrible flirt. Damon hadn\u0027t minded her dark side, and in fact seemed to appreciate it. But when I was with her under her heady spell, I just wanted to ignore her vampire side. And when the vervain cleared my thoughts I was repelled by what she was. All of my feelings, deep feelings, for her, had been the stuff of glamour. For Damon, it was all real.\\n\\n \"And I don\u0027t love Lydia,\" I said. \"But that doesn\u0027t mean I want to see her - or anyone - hurt.\"\\n\\n \"Then you do exactly as I say, brother, and everyone will be fine. But if you step out of line, even once...\" Damon dragged a finger across his throat. \"Then their blood will be on your hands.\"\\n\\n For a long moment, all was silent as Damon and I glared at each other. I had vowed to never harm a human again, to never allow a human to come to harm because of me. I was trapped as neatly and as permanently as if I were still a sideshow vampire at a circus, tied with vervain ropes - and Damon knew it.\\n\\n I heaved a sigh. \"What do you want me to do?\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/stefan-s-diaries-the-craving-the-vampire-diaries-3/page-9.html","bookId":2075,"book":{"id":2075,"title":"Stefan\u0027s Diaries: The Craving (The Vampire Diaries #3)","description":"Storyline: The Craving (The Vampire Diaries: Stefan\u0027s Diaries #3) \\n After his brother, Damon Salvatore, betrays him in New Orleans, Stefan starts over in Manhattan.
