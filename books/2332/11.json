That way you can have a view of the entrance.\"\n \"If anybody tries anything,\" I said, \"it\u0027ll be on the street. The only thing I have to worry about in here is the mu shu pork.\"\n He laughed at that, but all the same he came around the table, and I shrugged and took the seat he\u0027d vacated. \"There,\" he said. \"I\u0027ve done my part. I suppose you have to keep your jacket on, unless you want the whole world to see that you\u0027re strapped. What\u0027s the matter?\"\n \"\u0027Packing heat,\u0027\" I said. \"\u0027Strapped.\u0027\"\n \"Hey, I stay current on the lingo. I watch TV.\" He grinned. \"I\u0027m keeping my jacket on, too, but not out of solidarity. I swear the last time I was in here it was in the middle of a heat wave and it was hotter in here than it was outside. Today\u0027s a nice autumn day and they\u0027ve got the air conditioner going full blast. Did you have air conditioning at home when you were a kid?\"\n \"Are you kidding? We were lucky we had air.\"\n \"Same here,\" he said. \"We had a fan, and everybody would huddle together in front of it, and it would blow hot air on us.\"\n \"But you didn\u0027t complain.\"\n \"No, heat was different,\" he said. \"Heat you could complain about. Here\u0027s our guy. You want to order?\"\n \"I haven\u0027t even looked at the menu,\" I said. \"And I want to wash up first. If you want you can go ahead and order for both of us.\"\n He shook his head. \"No hurry,\" he said, and told the waiter we\u0027d need a few minutes.\n I found the men\u0027s room and used it. The usual sign advised me that employees were required to wash their hands, and I washed mine, even though I was unemployed at the moment. They had one of those hot-air dryers instead of paper towels, and if I\u0027d noticed it ahead of time I might not have been so quick to wash my hands. I hate the damned things, they take forever and my hands never feel dry when I\u0027m done. But I\u0027d washed them, and now I stood there and dried them, and while it took its time I thought how I\u0027d report all this to Jim in a few minutes.\n I looked at myself in the mirror and fussed with my shirt collar, trying to hide the vest without buttoning the top button. Not that anyone could really see it, or know what they were seeing. Not that it mattered. Still, if I took hold of it and tugged it down a little in front-\n That\u0027s what I was doing when I heard the shots.\n I could have failed to notice them. They weren\u0027t that loud. Or I could have taken them for something else. A truck backfiring, a waiter dropping a tray. Anything at all.\n But for some reason I knew instantly what I was hearing and realized just what it meant. I burst out of the men\u0027s room and raced the length of the hallway and into the dining room. I took in the scene there at a glance- Jim, an openmouthed waiter, a pair of customers trying to shrink into the woodwork, a thin blond woman on the verge of hysteria, another woman trying to calm her. I ran past all of them and out the door, but the shooter was nowhere to be seen. He\u0027d vanished around a corner or jumped into a waiting car. Or disappeared in a puff of smoke, but whatever he\u0027d done he was gone.\n I went back inside. Nothing had changed. No one had moved. Jim was at our table, his back to the entrance. He had resumed reading while I was in the men\u0027s room, and the magazine section was on the table, open to an article about parents who kept their children out of school and educated them at home. I\u0027d known a few people over the years who\u0027d talked about wanting to do that, but nobody who\u0027d actually done it.\n He must have been reading when the killer approached, and he probably never saw it coming. He\u0027d been shot twice in the side of the head with a small-caliber pistol, a.22, as it turned out. There was a time when such weapons were ridiculed as toys or ladies\u0027 guns, but they\u0027d since become the ordnance of choice for professional killers. I\u0027m not entirely sure why. I\u0027m told that a lighter bullet tends to carom around inside the skull, greatly increasing the likelihood that a head shot will prove fatal. Maybe it\u0027s that, or maybe it\u0027s an ego thing. If you\u0027re really good at your trade you don\u0027t need a cannon, you can do fine with a scalpel.\n He\u0027d been shot twice, as I said, once in the temple, once in the ear. Not much more than an inch separated the two bullet holes. The killer got in close- I could see the powder burns, I could smell scorched hair and flesh- and he\u0027d dropped the gun when he was done using it, leaving it behind along with the ejected casings.\n I didn\u0027t touch the gun or move to examine it. I didn\u0027t know then that it was in fact a.22, I didn\u0027t recognize the maker or model, but that\u0027s what it looked like, and that\u0027s what the wounds looked like.\n He\u0027d slumped forward, the unwounded side of his face pressed against the magazine open on the table in front of him. Blood had trickled down his cheek and some of it had pooled on the magazine. Not a lot of blood, though. You pretty much stop bleeding once you\u0027re dead, and he must have been dead before the killer cleared the threshold, perhaps even before the gun hit the floor.\n How old was he? Sixty-one, sixty-two? Something like that. A middle-aged man in a red polo shirt and khakis, wearing an unzipped tan windbreaker He still had most of his hair, though it had crept back some from his forehead and was thinning at the crown. He\u0027d shaved that morning, nicking himself lightly on the chin. I couldn\u0027t see the place now but I\u0027d noticed it earlier, before I went to the men\u0027s room. He did that a lot, cut himself shaving Used to do that a lot.\n Ike, of Ike and Mike.\n I stood there. People were saying things and they may have been saying some of them to me, but nothing was registering. My eyes were focused on a sentence from the article on home schooling, but that wasn\u0027t registering either. I just stood there, and eventually I heard a siren, and eventually the cops showed up.\n If only.\n If only I\u0027d canceled dinner. We\u0027d seen a lot of each other in the past several weeks. Let\u0027s skip a week, I could have suggested. He wouldn\u0027t have objected. Odds are he\u0027d have been secretly relieved.\n If only we\u0027d gone down to Chinatown. The vegetarian place down there was on Pell Street, up a long flight of narrow stairs. A pro would never hit anybody in a place like that, leaving himself with a tricky escape route.\n If only I\u0027d put on different clothes. I\u0027ve never paid much attention to what I\u0027m wearing, I generally grab the top shirt off the stack. This time the shirt happened to be red, and so did his.\n Whoever tagged me from the Parc Vendфme to the Lucky Panda was following a man in a red polo shirt and khaki slacks and a tan windbreaker. And when he (or whoever he called) entered the restaurant himself, he saw a man in those very clothes sitting alone at a table, the only person around who came close to fitting the description. He didn\u0027t need to ask to see some ID. He did what he\u0027d come to do and dropped the gun on the floor and took off.\n If only he\u0027d taken a good look at Jim first.\n If only I\u0027d worn my blazer. So what if it bulged a little over the shoulder holster? I wasn\u0027t posing for a layout in GQ.\n If only I\u0027d taken a minute to empty my goddamn bladder before I left the house. I\u0027d never have left the table, I\u0027d have been sitting across from Jim when the shooter walked in. Son of a bitch would have thought he was seeing double. He might well have decided to shoot both of us and let God sort us out, and he might have managed it, too, but he\u0027d have had a moment\u0027s confusion, a few seconds while he paused and figured it out, and maybe that would have been time enough for me to spot him and go for my own gun.\n If only I\u0027d resisted his suggestion to change seats. Jim might have seen the guy walk in, might have had a chance to react. And the shooter, seeing his face instead of the back of his head, might have realized he had the wrong man.\n If only I\u0027d skipped washing my hands. Or wiped them on my pants instead of wasting time at the hot-air dryer. I\u0027d have been emerging from the men\u0027s room right around the time the shooter was approaching Jim\u0027s table. I could have called out a warning, could have drawn my own gun, could have dropped the bastard before he shot my friend.\n If only…\n If only I\u0027d stood there and taken my beating like a man the other night. It wouldn\u0027t have killed me, and that would have been the end of it. I\u0027d have learned my lesson, or seemed to, and they\u0027d have left me alone. But no, I had to be a hero, I had to show off and fight back.\n If only I\u0027d been wearing sneakers that night. I was wearing them now. Why couldn\u0027t I have been wearing them then? When I stomped the foot of the guy behind me, he\u0027d have grunted and held on, and I\u0027d have earned an extra wallop for my troubles.\n If only I\u0027d followed through. If I insisted on fighting back and if I was lucky enough to come out ahead, why couldn\u0027t I have finished the job? If only I\u0027d acted on my impulse and kicked the slugger in the head, and kicked him again, and kept at it until I kicked his fucking head in. And put a bullet in the other one\u0027s chest while I was at it, and pressed the gun into his buddy\u0027s fist. Let the cops figure that one out. With a couple of lowlife skells like that, they wouldn\u0027t kill themselves trying.\n Oh, hell. If only I\u0027d passed on the case in the first place. Told Mick I didn\u0027t want to get involved. I\u0027d wound up telling him that anyway just a day later.\n Story of my life, always a day late and a dollar short.\n If only I\u0027d fired him as a sponsor. I\u0027d been sober for years, I\u0027d evidently long since mastered the subtle art of not drinking a day at a time, so what did I need with a sponsor? Why prolong the relationship, and why maintain the silly tradition of Chinese Sunday night dinners?\n Elaine could have reminded me that I was a married man, that I ought to be having dinner every Sunday with my wife. She\u0027d never do that, it wasn\u0027t like her at all, but if only she had.\n If only I\u0027d never picked him as a sponsor in the first place. He\u0027d been the obvious choice, the only person who paid any real attention to me when I started coming to meetings at St. Paul\u0027s. I was still drinking on and off at first, not at all sure I wanted to be there and apparently incapable of declaring myself an alcoholic, or indeed of saying anything more than I absolutely had to. When it was my inescapable turn to speak, I\u0027d say, My name is Matt, and I think I\u0027ll just listen tonight. I didn\u0027t think anyone noticed me, and it was months later before I learned that I\u0027d had an AA sobriquet for a little while there. People referred to me as Matt the Listener.\n But he took an interest, always said hello, always passed the time of day. Invited me to join a couple of them for coffee after the meeting. Listened respectfully when I spouted nonsense in the manner of the newly sober. Offered the occasional suggestion, so gently put that I rarely realized I hadn\u0027t thought of it myself.\n I keep hearing I ought to get a sponsor, I said offhandedly one night. Said it after having rehearsed it for two days. What do you think? I said.\n It\u0027s probably not a bad idea, he said.\n No, I said, about you being my sponsor. What do you think about that?\n I think I probably already am, he said. But, he said, if you\u0027d like to make it formal, I\u0027d say it sounds okay to me.\n He was just this guy in an old army jacket. For a long time I didn\u0027t know what he did for a living, or what life he had outside the AA rooms. Then he led a meeting and I heard his story. And then we got to know each other, and drank gallons of coffee at meetings and after meetings, and sat across the table from each other on hundreds of Sunday nights.\n If only I\u0027d picked someone else to be my sponsor, or no one at all. If only I\u0027d looked around that basement room and said thanks but no thanks and gone back out for a drink. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/everybody-dies-matthew-scudder-14/page-11.html","bookId":2332,"book":{"id":2332,"title":"Everybody Dies (Matthew Scudder #14)","description":"Storyline: \n Everybody Dies (Matthew Scudder #14) \n Matt Scudder is finally leading a comfortable life.
