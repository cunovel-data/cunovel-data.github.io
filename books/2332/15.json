{"id":64402,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"\"I told those two bozos the other night that I was done working for Ballou, and I told Mick the same thing. And that was that.\" \"But?\" \"But I must have known it wasn\u0027t going to be that easy,\" I said, \"or I wouldn\u0027t have gone straight to Jovine\u0027s for a shoulder rig. I told myself if I stayed away from Mick and kept close to home they\u0027d find it easy to forget about me. But obviously they\u0027d already made a decision to kill me, and tonight was the first chance they got, and they took it.\" I frowned. \"It shouldn\u0027t change anything. Oh, I\u0027m raging inside over Jim\u0027s death. Most of my anger\u0027s at myself for getting him killed, but- \" \"You didn\u0027t get him killed.\" \"I put him in harm\u0027s way. Blame or no blame, that\u0027s hard to argue with. He was killed because someone mistook him for me, and that happened because I met him for dinner. And because I\u0027d given someone cause to want me dead.\" \"I could argue with you, but I won\u0027t.\" \"Good. As I was saying, most of my anger\u0027s with myself. But there\u0027s some left over for the shooter, and for whoever sicced him on me.\" \"Two different people?\" \"Two minimum. Somebody made the decision, either the slugger with the slicked-down hair or the guy who gave him his orders. Somebody else staked out our building and followed me from here to the Chinese restaurant. He could have been the slugger or his chum- they\u0027d both recognize me without trouble- or there could have been a third person, someone who wouldn\u0027t have to worry that I might recognize him.\" \"If so, maybe he doubled as the shooter.\" \"Maybe, but I\u0027d bet against it. I think he followed me to the restaurant, then posted himself across the street, making a quick call on his cell phone…\" \"I guess they\u0027ve all got cell phones these days.\" \"Everybody but you and me, it seems like. Even Mick\u0027s got one, if you can believe that. He used it the other night to call ahead to the farm and say we were on our way.\" \"\u0027Leave a light burning, and a shovel on the back steps.\u0027\" \"The tail calls the shooter, who gets in his car and hurries to the scene. They meet on the street and the tail points to the Lucky Panda. \u0027Red shirt, tan jacket, Gap khakis, sneakers,\u0027 he says. \u0027You can\u0027t miss him.\u0027 \"Then he gets behind the wheel, unless there\u0027s already a driver in addition to the shooter. Whoever\u0027s doing the driving puts the car someplace handy and keeps the motor running, and the shooter goes in with a gun and comes out without it, and he jumps in the car and they\u0027re gone.\" \"And a man\u0027s dead,\" she said. \"And a man\u0027s dead.\" \"It could have been you.\" \"It was supposed to be me.\" \"But God had other ideas.\" That was one way to look at it. I said, \"Two men on Ninth Avenue the night before last. A third who ordered the hit. A fourth man to trail me to the Lucky Panda, and a fifth to walk in and pull the trigger. And maybe a sixth man to drive the car.\" I looked at her. \"That\u0027s a lot of people to get even with.\" \"Is that what you want to do?\" \"You can\u0027t help wanting to,\" I said. \"The urge is pretty basic, and I suppose it\u0027s instinctive, even cellular. \u0027They did it to us, we\u0027re gonna do it to them.\u0027 Look at human history.\" \"Look at Bosnia,\" she said. \"But it\u0027s five or six people, as I said, and I don\u0027t even know who they are. And I can\u0027t make myself believe Jim\u0027s spirit is crying out for vengeance. If there\u0027s a part of you that survives, I\u0027m inclined to believe it\u0027s not the part that takes things personally. Didn\u0027t you ask what Jim would tell me now? Well, what he wouldn\u0027t tell me is to get out there and kill one for the Gipper.\" \"No, that doesn\u0027t sound like Jim.\" \"I hate the idea of sitting back and letting them get away with it,\" I said, \"but I\u0027m not sure anybody ever really gets away with anything, and I think I\u0027ve largely outgrown the notion that the world can\u0027t get along without my help.\" \"It\u0027s a pretty common delusion,\" she said, \"and the more religious a person is, the more he\u0027ll subscribe to it. If there\u0027s one thing the fundamentalists of the world have in common it\u0027s the conviction that God\u0027s work won\u0027t get done unless they pitch in and do it. Their God\u0027s all-powerful, but He\u0027s screwed unless they help Him out.\" I drank some coffee. I said, \"It\u0027s not my job to punish them. I\u0027m not appointing myself judge and jury, and I\u0027m not volunteering for the firing squad, either. I told them I was off the case, and I told Mick the same thing, and Jim\u0027s death doesn\u0027t change that. I still want to walk away from it.\" \"Thank God for that.\" \"But there\u0027s a problem. See, I don\u0027t think I can.\" \"Why not?\" \"I walked away from it two nights ago,\" I said, \"and it didn\u0027t do me any good. Their response was to send somebody to kill me. As far as they were concerned I was still on the case. Or maybe they didn\u0027t care. On or off, I was the son of a. bitch who kicked their asses, and maybe that\u0027s all you have to do around here to get Madame Defarge to knit your name in the shawl. Because one way or another I got my name on the Death List, and Jim\u0027s dying isn\u0027t going to get me off it.\" \"So even if you don\u0027t do a thing…\" \"I\u0027m still marked for death. By now they probably know they killed the wrong guy, and if not they\u0027ll know by morning. I may be inclined to think of Jim as having died for my sins, but that won\u0027t make them accept his death as a substitute for mine.\" \"Your name\u0027s still in the shawl.\" \"I\u0027m afraid so.\" She looked at me. \"So? What do we do?\" What we tried to do was make love, but that didn\u0027t really work, so we just held each other. I told a few stories about Jim, some she\u0027d heard before, others that were new to her. A couple of them were funny, and we laughed. She said, \"I probably shouldn\u0027t say this, but it\u0027s rattling around in my head and making me crazy. I\u0027m terribly sorry for what happened to Jim. I\u0027m sorry for him and I\u0027m sorry for Beverly, and of course I\u0027m sorry for you. \"But sorry isn\u0027t all I feel. I\u0027m glad it was him and not you.\" I didn\u0027t say anything. \"It\u0027s something I find myself thinking all the time,\" she said. \"It\u0027s what the voice in my head says every time I read the obituaries, and sometimes I think that\u0027s why I read the obituaries. So I can say \u0027Better her than me\u0027 whenever some dame my age dies of breast cancer. \u0027Better him than Matt\u0027 when some poor guy drops dead on the golf course. \u0027Better them than us\u0027 whenever there\u0027s an earthquake or a flood or a plague or a plane crash. Whoever they were, whatever happened to them, better them than us.\" \"It\u0027s a pretty natural response.\" \"But for a change it really resonates, doesn\u0027t it? Because it was pretty much a case of one or the other. If Jim went to the bathroom and you stayed at the table…\" \"It might have turned out differently. I\u0027d have been facing the door when he walked in. And I had a gun.\" \"And would you have gone for it in time?\" If I\u0027d looked up when the door opened, I\u0027d have seen a stranger, a black man who looked not at all like the pair of white guys who jumped me. And that\u0027s if I looked up. I might well have been engrossed in the menu, or reading Jim\u0027s magazine. \"Maybe,\" I said. \"But probably not.\" \"So better him than you is what I say. My heart aches for Beverly, it makes me sick to think of what she\u0027s going through right now, but better her than me. These aren\u0027t noble sentiments, are they?\" \"I don\u0027t suppose they are.\" \"But God knows they\u0027re heartfelt And you have to feel the same way, baby. Because you can tell yourself it should have been you there slumped in your own blood, but it wasn\u0027t you and in your heart you\u0027re glad of it. I\u0027m right, aren\u0027t I?\" \"Yes,\" I said after a moment. \"I guess you are. I almost wish it weren\u0027t so, but it is.\" \"All that means is you\u0027re glad to be alive, sweetie.\" \"I guess so.\" \"That\u0027s not necessarily a bad thing.\" \"I guess not.\" \"You know,\" she said, \"it probably wouldn\u0027t hurt you to cry.\" She may have been right about that, too, but we weren\u0027t going to find out. The last time I remember crying was at an early AA meeting, when I spoke up for the first time to identify myself as an alcoholic. The tears that followed took me completely by surprise. My eyes have stayed dry ever since, except for the occasional movie, and I don\u0027t think that counts. Those aren\u0027t real tears, any more than the fear that grips you at a horror film is genuine fear. So I couldn\u0027t cry and I couldn\u0027t make love, and it turned out I couldn\u0027t sleep, either. I almost drifted off and then I didn\u0027t, and finally I gave up and got out of bed and got dressed. I put the vest on under my shirt, and the holster over it. I zipped the windbreaker just far enough to conceal the gun. Then I went into the other room and made a phone call. \"A black man,\" Mick said, looking across the table at me. \"According to the witnesses.\" \"But you never saw him yourself.\" \"No, and I didn\u0027t get to question the witnesses, either, but I understand they all agreed the shooter was black. Medium height, medium build, twenties or thirties or forties- \" \"Narrows it down.\" \"And he had a beard or a mustache.\" \"One or the other?\" \"Or both,\" I said. \"Or neither, I suppose. He was in and out in less time than it takes to tell about it, and nobody had any reason to look at him before the shooting started, and then all they wanted to do was keep from getting shot themselves.\" \"But he was black,\" Mick said. \"On that point they\u0027re in rare agreement.\" \"Yes.\" \"Is it niggers then? And what am I to them, or they to me?\" He picked up his glass of whiskey, looked at it, set it down untouched. \"The two men who gave you a beating,\" he said, \"or tried to. Were they black?\" \"They were both white. The one with the gun sounded like a born New Yorker. I didn\u0027t get a good look at the other one, or hear him talk, but he was white.\" \"And the man who shot your friend…\" \"Was black.\" \"A white man could hire a black assassin,\" he said thoughtfully. \"But would this man bring in someone from outside? Wouldn\u0027t he use one of his own?\" \"Who is he?\" \"I don\u0027t know.\" \"But someone\u0027s trying to…\" \"Take it all away,\" he said. \"And I don\u0027t know who he is, or why it\u0027s me he\u0027s after.\" I didn\u0027t really think there\u0027d be anyone staked out at the Parc Vendфme, but I\u0027d just had my horse stolen and I wasn\u0027t about to leave the barn door unlocked. I went down to the basement and slipped out of the building by the rear service entrance. On my way to Grogan\u0027s I looked over my shoulder a lot. Nobody tailed me, and no one popped up out of the shadows in front of me. Mick had said he\u0027d make a pot of coffee, and he was at a table when I got there, with a bottle and glass in front of him and a stoneware coffee mug across from him. I scanned the room from the doorway. It was getting on for closing, but there were a fair number of people who didn\u0027t want the weekend to end, pairs and singles at the bar, a few couples at the tables. I spotted Andy Buckley and Tom Heaney way in back at the dartboard, Burke behind the bar, and old Eamonn Dougherty on the other side of it. Mick had pointed him out once as a legendary IRA gunman. He was killing men before you were born, he\u0027d said.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/everybody-dies-matthew-scudder-14/page-15.html","bookId":2332,"book":{"id":2332,"title":"Everybody Dies (Matthew Scudder #14)","description":"Storyline: Everybody Dies (Matthew Scudder #14) Matt Scudder is finally leading a comfortable life.
