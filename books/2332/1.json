{"id":64388,"no":1,"title":"Page 1","content":"- RANDY NEWMAN, \"Old Man\"\\n\\n At the door of life, by the gate of breath,\\n\\n There are worse things waiting for men than death.\\n\\n - SWINBURNE, \"The Triumph of Time\"\\n\\n Andy Buckley said, \"Jesus Christ,\"and braked the Cadillac to a stop. I looked up and there was the deer, perhaps a dozen yards away from us in the middle of our lane of traffic. He was unquestionably a deer caught in the headlights, but he didn\u0027t have that stunned look the expression is intended to convey. He was lordly, and very much in command.\\n\\n \"C\u0027mon,\" Andy said. \"Move your ass, Mister Deer.\"\\n\\n \"Move up on him,\" Mick said. \"But slowly.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t want a freezer full of venison, huh?\" Andy eased up on the brake and allowed the car to creep forward. The deer let us get surprisingly close before, with one great bound, he was off the road and out of sight in the darkened fields at the roadside.\\n\\n We\u0027d come north on the Palisades Parkway, northwest on Route 17, northeast on 209. We were on an unnumbered road when we stopped for the deer, and a few miles farther we turned left onto the winding gravel road that led to Mick Ballou\u0027s farm. It was past midnight when we left, and close to two by the time we got there. There was no traffic, so we could have gone faster, but Andy kept us a few miles an hour under the speed limit, braked for yellow lights, and yielded at intersections. Mick and I sat in back, Andy drove, and the miles passed in silence.\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve been here before,\" Mick said, as the old two-story farmhouse came into view.\\n\\n \"Twice.\"\\n\\n \"Once after that business in Maspeth,\" he remembered. \"You drove that night, Andy.\"\\n\\n \"I remember, Mick.\"\\n\\n \"And we\u0027d Tom Heaney with us as well. I feared we might lose Tom. He was hurt bad, but scarcely made a sound. Well, he\u0027s from the North. They\u0027re a closemouthed lot.\"\\n\\n He meant the North of Ireland.\\n\\n \"But you were here a second time? When was that?\"\\n\\n \"A couple of years ago. We made a night of it, and you drove me up to see the animals, and have a look at the place in daylight. And you sent me home with a dozen eggs.\"\\n\\n \"Now I remember. And I\u0027ll bet you never had a better egg.\"\\n\\n \"They were good eggs.\"\\n\\n \"Big yolks the color of a Spanish orange. It\u0027s a great economy, keeping chickens and getting your own eggs. My best calculation is that those eggs cost me twenty dollars.\"\\n\\n \"Twenty dollars a dozen?\"\\n\\n \"More like twenty dollars an egg. Though when herself cooks me a dish of them, I\u0027d swear it was worth that and more.\"\\n\\n Herself was Mrs. O\u0027Gara, and she and her husband were the farm\u0027s official owners. In the same fashion, there was somebody else\u0027s name on the Cadillac\u0027s title and registration, and on the deed and license for Grogan\u0027s Open House, the saloon he owned on the corner of Fiftieth and Tenth. He had some real estate holdings around town, and some business interests, but you wouldn\u0027t find his name on any official documents. He owned, he\u0027d told me, the clothes on his back, and if put to it he couldn\u0027t even prove those were legally his. What you don\u0027t own, he\u0027d said, they can\u0027t easily take away from you.\\n\\n Andy parked alongside the farmhouse. He got out of the car and lit a cigarette, lagging behind to smoke it while Mick and I climbed a few steps to the back porch. There was a light on in the kitchen, and Mr. O\u0027Gara was waiting for us at the round oak table. Mick had phoned earlier to warn O\u0027Gara that we were coming. \"You said not to wait up,\" he said now, \"but I wanted to make sure you had everything you\u0027d need. I made a fresh pot of coffee.\"\\n\\n \"Good man.\"\\n\\n \"All\u0027s well here. Last week\u0027s rain did us no harm. The apples should be good this year, and the pears even better.\"\\n\\n \"The summer\u0027s heat was no harm, then.\"\\n\\n \"None as wasn\u0027t mended,\" O\u0027Gara said. \"Thanks be to God. She\u0027s sleeping, and I\u0027ll turn in now myself, if that\u0027s all right. But you\u0027ve only to shout for me if you need anything.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re fine,\" Mick assured him. \"We\u0027ll be out back, and we\u0027ll try not to disturb you.\"\\n\\n \"Sure, we\u0027re sound sleepers,\" O\u0027Gara said. \"Ye\u0027d wake the dead before ye\u0027d wake us.\"\\n\\n O\u0027Gara took his cup of coffee upstairs with him. Mick filled a thermos with coffee, capped it, then found a bottle of Jameson in the cupboard and topped up the silver flask he\u0027d been nipping from all night. He returned it to his hip pocket, got two six-packs of O\u0027Keefe\u0027s Extra Old Stock ale from the refrigerator, gave them to Andy, and grabbed up the thermos jar and a coffee mug. We got back into the Cadillac and headed farther up the drive, past the fenced chicken yard, past the hogpen, past the barns, and into the old orchard. Andy parked the car, and Mick told us to wait while he walked back to what looked like an old-fashioned outhouse straight out of Li\u0027l Abner, but was evidently a toolshed. He came back carrying a shovel.\\n\\n He picked a spot and took the first turn, sinking the shovel into the earth, adding his weight to bury the blade to the hilt. Last week\u0027s rain had done no harm. He bent, lifted, tossed a shovelful of earth aside.\\n\\n I uncapped the thermos and poured myself some coffee. Andy lit a cigarette and cracked a can of ale. Mick went on digging. We took turns, Mick and Andy and I, opening a deep oblong hole in the earth alongside the pear and apple orchard. There were a few cherry trees as well, Mick said, but they were sour cherries, good only for pies, and it was easier to let the birds have them than to go to the trouble of picking them, taking into account that the birds would get most of them whatever you did.\\n\\n I\u0027d been wearing a light windbreaker, and Andy a leather jacket, but we\u0027d shucked them as we took our turns with the shovel Mick hadn\u0027t been wearing anything over his sport shirt. Cold didn\u0027t seem to bother him much, or heat either.\\n\\n During Andy\u0027s second turn, Mick followed a sip of whiskey with a long drink of ale and sighed deeply. \"I should get out here more,\" he said. \"You\u0027d need more than moonlight to see the full beauty of it, but you can feel the peace of it, can\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n He sniffed the wind. \"You can smell it, too. Hogs and chickens. A rank stench when you\u0027re close to it, but at this distance it\u0027s not so bad, is it?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not bad at all.\"\\n\\n \"It makes a change from automobile exhaust and cigarette smoke and all the stinks you meet with in a city. Still, I might mind this more if I smelled it every day. But if I smelled it every day I suppose I\u0027d cease to notice it.\"\\n\\n \"They say that\u0027s how it works. Otherwise people couldn\u0027t live in towns with paper mills.\"\\n\\n \"Jesus, that\u0027s the worst smell in the world, a paper mill.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s pretty bad. They say a tannery\u0027s even worse.\"\\n\\n \"It must be all in the process,\" he said, \"because the end product\u0027s spared. Leather has a pleasant smell to it, and paper\u0027s got no smell at all. And there\u0027s no smell kinder to the senses than bacon frying in a pan, and doesn\u0027t it come out of the same hogpen that\u0027s even now assaulting our nostrils? That reminds me.\"\\n\\n \"Of what?\"\\n\\n \"My gift to you the Christmas before last. A ham from one of my very own hogs.\"\\n\\n \"It was very generous.\"\\n\\n \"And what could be a more suitable gift for a Jewish vegetarian?\" He shook his head at the memory. \"And what a gracious woman she is. She thanked me so warmly that it was hours before it struck me what an inappropriate gift I\u0027d brought her. Did she cook it for you?\"\\n\\n She would have, if I\u0027d wanted, but why should Elaine cook something she\u0027s not going to eat? I eat enough meat when I\u0027m away from the house. Home or away, though, I might have had trouble with that ham. The first time Mick and I met, I was looking for a girl who\u0027d disappeared. It turned out she\u0027d been killed by her lover, a young man who worked for Mick. He\u0027d disposed of her corpse by feeding it to the hogs. Mick, outraged when he found out, had dispensed poetic justice, and the hogs had dined a second time. The ham he\u0027d brought us was from a different generation of swine, and had no doubt been fattened on grain and table scraps, but I was just as happy to give it to Jim Faber, whose enjoyment of it was uncomplicated by a knowledge of its history.\\n\\n \"A friend of mine had it for Christmas,\" I said. \"Said it was the best ham he ever tasted.\"\\n\\n \"Sweet and tender.\"\\n\\n \"So he said.\"\\n\\n Andy Buckley threw down the shovel, climbed up out of the hole, and drank most of a can of ale in a single long swallow. \"Christ,\" he said, \"that\u0027s thirsty work.\"\\n\\n \"Twenty-dollar eggs and thousand-dollar hams,\" Mick said. \"It\u0027s a grand career for a man, agriculture. However could a man fail at it?\"\\n\\n I grabbed the shovel and went to work.\\n\\n I took my turn and Mick took his. Halfway through it he leaned on his shovel and sighed. \"I\u0027ll feel this tomorrow,\" he said. \"All this work. But it\u0027s a good feeling for all that.\"\\n\\n \"Honest exercise.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s little enough of it I get in the ordinary course of things. How about yourself?\"\\n\\n \"I do a lot of walking.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s the best exercise of all, or so they say.\"\\n\\n \"That and pushing yourself away from the table.\"\\n\\n \"Ah, that\u0027s the hardest, and gets no easier with age.\"\\n\\n \"Elaine goes to the gym,\" I said. \"Three times a week. I tried, but it bores me to death.\"\\n\\n \"But you walk.\"\\n\\n \"I walk.\"\\n\\n He dug out his flask, and moonlight glinted off the silver. He took a drink and put it away, took up the shovel again. He said, \"I should come here more. I take long walks when I\u0027m here, you know. And do chores, though I suspect O\u0027Gara has to do them over again once I\u0027ve left. I\u0027ve no talent for farming.\"\\n\\n \"But you enjoy being here.\"\\n\\n \"I do, and yet I\u0027m never here. And if I enjoy it so, why am I always itching to get back to the city?\"\\n\\n \"You miss the action,\" Andy suggested.\\n\\n \"Do I? I didn\u0027t miss it so much when I was with the brothers.\"\\n\\n \"The monks,\" I said.\\n\\n He nodded. \"The Thessalonian Brothers. In Staten Island, just a ferryboat ride from Manhattan, but you\u0027d think you were a world away.\"\\n\\n \"When were you there last? It was just this spring, wasn\u0027t it?\"\\n\\n \"The last two weeks of May. June, July, August, September. Four months ago, close enough. Next time you\u0027ll have to come with me.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, right.\"\\n\\n \"And why not?\"\\n\\n \"Mick, I\u0027m not even Catholic.\"\\n\\n \"Who\u0027s to say what you are or aren\u0027t? You\u0027ve come to Mass with me.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s for twenty minutes, not two weeks I\u0027d feel out of place.\"\\n\\n \"You wouldn\u0027t. It\u0027s a retreat. Have you never done a retreat?\"\\n\\n I shook my head. \"A friend of mine goes sometimes,\" I said.\\n\\n \"To the Thessalonians?\"\\n\\n \"To the Zen Buddhists. They\u0027re not that far from here, now that I think of it. Is there a town near here called Livingston Manor?\"\\n\\n \"Indeed there is, and \u0027tis not far at all.\"\\n\\n \"Well, the monastery\u0027s near there. He\u0027s been three or four times.\"\\n\\n \"Is he a Buddhist, then?\"\\n\\n \"He was brought up Catholic, but he\u0027s been away from the church for ages.\"\\n\\n \"And so he goes to the Buddhists for retreat. Have I met him, this friend of yours?\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/everybody-dies-matthew-scudder-14/page-1.html","bookId":2332,"book":{"id":2332,"title":"Everybody Dies (Matthew Scudder #14)","description":"Storyline: Everybody Dies (Matthew Scudder #14) \\n Matt Scudder is finally leading a comfortable life.
