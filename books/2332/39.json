{"id":64426,"no":39,"title":"Page 39","content":"\"So we can\u0027t call you a Bronx boy.\" \"I don\u0027t think so.\" \"Your father had a store,\" Mick said. \"He sold children\u0027s shoes.\" \"Jesus, how did you remember that?\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" he said. \"How do we remember some things and forget others? It\u0027s certainly not a matter of what\u0027s useful to remember and what\u0027s not. There\u0027s no end of useful things I can\u0027t recall to save myself, and yet I remember your father\u0027s shoe store.\" A little later he said, \"Is your mother well, Andy?\" \"She is, Mick. Thanks be to God.\" \"Thanks be to God,\" he echoed. \"When you went to talk to her just now I suppose you found her in the kitchen.\" \"Matter of fact, she was parked in front of the TV.\" \"Watching a program, was she?\" \"And looking at the paper at the same time. Why, Mick?\" \"Ah, just wondering. Looking at the paper. The Irish Echo, was it?\" \"I didn\u0027t even notice. It could have been the Echo.\" \"Do you ever read it yourself, Andy?\" \"More for the older people, isn\u0027t it? Or the green-horns fresh off the boat.\" \"Off the plane, these days. Well, your people are a great old family, you know. The Buckleys, I\u0027m talking about. Some were what you\u0027d call Castle Irish. Do you know the term? It means they were in with the lot at Dublin Castle, the British crown\u0027s representatives in Ireland. But there were other Buckleys that were very republican. Which were yours, I wonder?\" Andy laughed. \"I get people asking if I\u0027m related to that guy, you know who I mean, uses all the big words on television? But you\u0027re the first person ever asked me what side my people were on back in the old country.\" \"Has your mother ever gone back?\" \"No, she was just a girl when she came over. She\u0027s got no interest in going back. It\u0027s hard enough to get her to visit her brother in Massachusetts.\" \"Your uncle Connie, that would be.\" \"Right.\" \"And how about yourself? Have you ever been over to the old country?\" \"Are you kidding? I\u0027ve never been anywhere, Mick.\" \"Ah, you should go. There\u0027s nothing like travel for broadening a man. Though I\u0027ve done little enough of it myself. Ireland, of course, and France. Matt\u0027s been to France. And to Italy as well, have you not?\" \"Just briefly,\" I said. \"I\u0027ve not been there myself. But then the last time I was in Ireland I went over to England as well, just to see if they were the devils I learned them to be at my mother\u0027s knee.\" \"And were they?\" \"Not at all,\" he said. \"They couldn\u0027t have been nicer. I was treated decently everywhere I went. For all the problems they\u0027ve had with the Irish, they always made me feel welcome.\" \"Maybe they didn\u0027t know you were Irish,\" Andy suggested. \"You\u0027re entirely right,\" Mick said. \"Most likely they took me for a Chinaman.\" As we turned onto 209 he said, \"It\u0027s a good scheme, Andy. I\u0027ve been thinking about it these last few miles. The only hard part will be getting the word to them so they don\u0027t suspect the source of it. It would help if we knew who\u0027s been helping them all along. Have you any ideas yourself, lad?\" Andy considered, shook his head. \"There\u0027s a lot of guys hang out at Grogan\u0027s,\" he said. \"Not now there\u0027s not.\" \"Well, used to be. People who\u0027d run an errand for you, or lend a hand on the big jobs. I had to guess, I\u0027d say somebody took one of them aside and got a few drinks into him, got him talking.\" \"You think that\u0027s it, do you?\" \"Be my guess.\" \"There\u0027s a great Irish tradition of hating the informer,\" Mick said. \"There\u0027s that movie, and I can remember about your father\u0027s shoe store, Matt, so why can I not recall the name of that actor? I can see his face but can\u0027t summon up his name.\" \"Victor McLaglen,\" I supplied. \"The very man. Oh, the most hated man in Ireland was the man who bore tales. \u0027The Patriot\u0027s Mother.\u0027 Do you know that song?\" Neither of us did. In a surprisingly soft voice he sang: Alana, alana, the shadow of shame Has never yet fallen on one of your name And oh, may the food from my bosom you drew In your veins turn to poison ere you turn untrue \"It\u0027s the mother singing,\" he explained, \"and she\u0027s urging her boy to die on the gallows rather than inform on his fellows. Alana machree, oh, alana machree Sure, a stag and a traitor you never shall be \"Ah, \u0027tis a terrible old song, but it gives you an idea how our people felt on the subject. A great tradition of hating the informer. And of course you know what that means.\" \"What?\" \"A great tradition of informing,\" he said. \"For how could you have the one without the other?\" The caprice didn\u0027t offer as smooth a ride as the Cadillac. It wasn\u0027t as whisper-quiet, either, with more road noise audible and a rattle somewhere in the rear end. But it was comfortable all the same, with Andy and me in front and Mick stretched out in the back and the headlights cutting the darkness in front of us. I half wished we could ride on like that forever. We\u0027d turned onto the unnumbered road, and Mick said, \"\u0027Twas along here we saw the deer.\" \"I remember,\" Andy said. \"I almost hit him.\" \"You did not. You stopped in plenty of time.\" \"A good thing, too. He was a big one. If I\u0027d thought, I\u0027d have counted the points.\" \"The points?\" \"On his antlers, Mick. That\u0027s how the hunters rate the bucks, by the number of points on their antlers. He was a big one, but don\u0027t ask me how many points he ran to, because I wasn\u0027t paying attention.\" \"Hunters. O\u0027Gara posts the property, keeps the hunters off of it. I don\u0027t want the trespassing, you know. And I don\u0027t want deer shot on my land. They\u0027re terrible predators, you can\u0027t keep them out of the orchard, but I won\u0027t have men shooting them. I wonder why that is.\" \"You\u0027re getting soft in your old age.\" \"I must be,\" he agreed. \"Slow down a bit, why don\u0027t you?\" \"Slow down?\" \"There\u0027s deer all through here. The big buck was standing in the middle of the road, but sometimes you\u0027ve no warning at all and they leap out right in front of you.\" I thought of Danny Boy and his list, and pictured the deer dashing out from between parked cars. Andy eased up on the gas and the car slowed some. \"In fact,\" Mick said, \"why don\u0027t you pull over altogether?\" \"Pull over?\" \"Sure, what\u0027s our rush? We\u0027ll all stretch our legs and you can smoke a cigarette.\" \"I\u0027d just as soon wait, to tell you the truth. We\u0027re almost there.\" \"Pull over,\" Mick said. \"Yeah, sure,\" Andy said, \"only I got to find a spot with some room on the shoulder. Should be a place coming up soon.\" Mick drew a breath, then leaned forward and hooked an arm around Andy\u0027s throat. He said, \"Matt, take hold of the wheel, that\u0027s a good man. Andy, ease the brake on, and do it gently, boy, or I swear I\u0027ll throttle you. Guide us off the road, Matt, that\u0027s lovely, and now turn off the ignition. And take his gun, the one in his waistband, and see if he\u0027s got another on him.\" \"This is crazy,\" Andy said. \"Mick, don\u0027t do this.\" There were two guns, one under his belt in front, the other at the small of his back. I got them both, and Mick motioned for me to set them on the dashboard. \"Out of the car,\" Mick said. \"Come on now. Here\u0027s our spy, Matt. Here\u0027s our informer. Stand still, Andy. And don\u0027t even think about running. You wouldn\u0027t make ten yards. I\u0027d shoot the legs out from under you, you know I would.\" \"I\u0027m not going anywhere,\" Andy said. \"You\u0027ve got this all wrong. Matt, tell him, will you? He\u0027s got this all wrong.\" \"I\u0027m not so sure of that,\" I said. To me Mick said, \"You knew, didn\u0027t you?\" \"Not as early as you did. I had a sense of where you were going but I thought you were just fishing. But then I caught on when he said his mother was watching television.\" \"And reading the newspaper.\" \"Right.\" \"Are you guys both nuts? I\u0027m a spy because my ma\u0027s watching the TV?\" \"That call you made,\" I said, \"a minute or two after Andy went into the house. You passed it off as a call to O\u0027Gara and hung up before he could answer. But you didn\u0027t call the farm, did you? You called Andy\u0027s number.\" \"I did.\" \"And you got a busy signal,\" I said. \"So you knew he was on the phone, calling Dowling and letting him know we were on our way.\" Andy said, \"Let me get this straight. You called my house, Mick? While I was in there talking to my mother?\" \"But you weren\u0027t talking to her,\" Mick said. \"You were talking to Paddy Farrelly\u0027s son. A pity you didn\u0027t talk to her instead. She might have sung you a verse or two of that song. \u0027The Patriot\u0027s Mother,\u0027 and I trust you can remember it as I haven\u0027t the heart to sing it again for you.\" \"The line was busy,\" Andy said. \"That\u0027s what this is all about? The line was busy?\" \"It was.\" \"Jesus, I was in the john. Maybe she made a call while I was taking a leak. Why don\u0027t you call her right now and ask her?\" Mick let out a sigh, then reached to lay a hand on Andy\u0027s shoulder. \"Andy,\" he said gently, \"why do you think people have been going to Confession for all these centuries? They feel better afterward. And don\u0027t tell me you\u0027ve nothing to confess. Andy, look at me. Andy, I know it\u0027s you.\" \"Aaah, Jesus, Mick.\" \"Suggesting we go to the farm, all of us, and lay a trap for them. That set the alarm bells ringing. You\u0027d have done better to let me come up with the idea myself, with maybe the least bit of a hint from yourself to steer me in that direction. \"And you\u0027d no way of knowing I\u0027d be wary the instant the farm was mentioned. You see, your murderous friend fell into a wee trap himself. He called Matt\u0027s house, and Matt pressed the numbers you press to call the person back. The person who answered didn\u0027t say much. But didn\u0027t you say he sounded Irish? And had a soft voice?\" I nodded. \"O\u0027Gara, it must have been. They kept him alive in case I called, so that he could answer the phone. \u0027There\u0027s no one there,\u0027 he told them, and they broke the connection. Do you suppose he and his wife are still alive, Andy? Or have they killed them already, now that you called to say we were on our way?\" \"Jesus, Mick.\" \"Were you there when they killed Tom, Andy? And the old woman in the wheelchair?\" \"They never said they were going to do that.\" \"And what did you think they were going to do with her? Put her on a bus to Atlantic City, with a bag of quarters for the slot machines?\" \"Oh, God,\" he said. He had his face in his bands, and his shoulders were heaving. Gently Mick said, \"How did he get to you, Andy? Did he remember you from school?\" \"He was a year behind me at St. Ignatius.\" \"And you knew him well, did you?\" \"Not well at all, but when he turned up I knew him right away. He had the same face when he was a kid.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/everybody-dies-matthew-scudder-14/page-39.html","bookId":2332,"book":{"id":2332,"title":"Everybody Dies (Matthew Scudder #14)","description":"Storyline: Everybody Dies (Matthew Scudder #14) Matt Scudder is finally leading a comfortable life.
