{"id":64417,"no":30,"title":"Page 30","content":"Elaine had called Dr. Jerome Froelich, who I gathered had performed more than his share of abortions in the pre-Roe v. Wade days, even as he\u0027d written more than his share of morphine and Dexedrine prescriptions. It was around two in the morning when she called him, and he grumbled but he came.\n She asked him how bad it was.\n \"He\u0027s resting comfortably,\" he said. \"I sedated him and dressed the wound. He probably ought to be in a hospital. On the other hand, maybe he\u0027s lucky he\u0027s not. He\u0027s lost some blood, and they\u0027d most likely give him a unit or two of whole blood, and you know what? If it was me, I\u0027d just as soon not have some stranger\u0027s blood dripping into my veins, thank you just the same.\"\n \"Because of HIV?\"\n \"Because of any number of goddamn things, including ones they can\u0027t test for because nobody knows what they are. I just don\u0027t have a lot of faith in the blood supply these days. Sometimes you\u0027ve got no choice, but if all you are is down a pint or so, I\u0027d rather give the body a chance to make its own. You know what I want you to do?\"\n \"What?\"\n \"Go out and get a juicer. Then- \"\n \"We\u0027ve already got one,\" she told him.\n \"I\u0027m not talking about citrus, I mean a vegetable juicer. You got one of those?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"Well, good for you,\" he said.\n \"We don\u0027t use it much, but- \"\n \"You should. Things are worth their weight in gold. What you do, buy beets and carrots. Organically grown\u0027s best, but if you haven\u0027t got a source- \"\n \"I know where I can get them.\"\n \"Beet juice is a blood builder, but don\u0027t give it to him straight. Mix it half and half with carrot, and prepare it fresh each time before you give it to him. It\u0027s not as quick as a transfusion, but nobody ever got hepatitis from it.\"\n \"I knew beet juice was supposed to be a blood builder,\" she said, \"but I don\u0027t know if I would have thought of it. And I never expected to hear it recommended by a doctor.\"\n \"Most doctors never heard of it, and wouldn\u0027t want to hear of it. But I\u0027m not like most doctors, my dear.\"\n \"No, you\u0027re not.\"\n \"Most doctors don\u0027t take care of themselves the way I do. Most doctors don\u0027t look or feel this good at my age. I\u0027m seventy-eight. Assure me I don\u0027t look it.\"\n \"You know you don\u0027t.\"\n \"You should see me after I\u0027ve had an uninterrupted night\u0027s sleep. I\u0027m even more gorgeous then. I\u0027m expensive, though, day or night. This is going to cost you two thousand dollars.\"\n \"All right.\"\n \"Look at her, she doesn\u0027t bat an eye. It\u0027s a ridiculous price, but here\u0027s something even more ridiculous. If you\u0027d taken the young fellow to a hospital it would have wound up costing you that and more by the time you got out of there.\"\n I didn\u0027t have to hunt for the money. I\u0027d taken it along in case I had to show it to Purvis, and now I counted it out and handed it to Dr. Froelich.\n \"Thank you,\" he said. \"I won\u0027t give you a receipt, and neither will I report it, to the police or to the IRS. The price includes aftercare, incidentally. I\u0027ll drop around sometime late afternoon to check on him and change the dressing. Check his temperature every couple of hours, give him aspirin when he needs it for pain, and call me if his fever spikes. If it does, but I don\u0027t think it will. And don\u0027t forget the beet juice. Beet and carrot, equal parts, all you can get into him. It\u0027s good to see you, Elaine. I\u0027ve often thought of you, wondered what became of you. You\u0027re as beautiful as ever.\"\n \"More,\" I said.\n He cocked his head, looked at her. \"You know,\" he said, \"I believe you\u0027re right.\"\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" I said after he\u0027d left. \"Maybe I should have taken him straight to a hospital.\"\n \"You heard what Jerry said. He\u0027s probably better off here, and drinking beet juice instead of getting a transfusion.\"\n \"That\u0027s good to know,\" I said. \"But the thing is I didn\u0027t know it at the time. I could see the bleeding wasn\u0027t too severe, and I didn\u0027t think he was in any immediate danger. If a doctor looked at him and saw that hospitalization was necessary, there\u0027d be time to get him to an ER then.\"\n \"That makes sense.\"\n \"Gunshot wounds have to be reported,\" I said, \"and I didn\u0027t want that. He\u0027s a young black male without a police record, and that\u0027s the sort of distinction you don\u0027t want to give up for no good reason.\"\n \"I know he\u0027ll be glad he wasn\u0027t hospitalized.\"\n \"I was probably thinking of myself as well. The slug Froelich took out of him may make a nice souvenir, but if they\u0027d dug it out at Bellevue or Roosevelt or Brooklyn Jewish they wouldn\u0027t have let him keep it. They\u0027d have turned it over to the cops, and a ballistics check might show an interesting matchup.\"\n \"With the bullets that killed Jim Faber?\"\n \"No, because he left the gun at the scene. But with a gun found in an apartment in Brooklyn, along with a dead body with a couple of other bullets in it. Bullets from a.38 revolver, and that reminds me. I\u0027m going to have to get rid of this gun.\"\n \"Because it leads straight to the dead man in Brooklyn. You want me to take it out and drop it down a storm drain?\"\n \"Not until I find a replacement for it. I thought about leaving it at the scene and taking his gun, but what do I want with a dinky little.22?\"\n \"Mah man wants a man\u0027s gun,\" she drawled. \"I\u0027ll tell you one thing you can get rid of right now, and that\u0027s the shirt you\u0027re wearing. It\u0027s got bullet holes in it. Well, not holes, because the bullets didn\u0027t go through, but bullet marks. How about the jacket? No, he missed that, but it\u0027s got bloodstains, and so do your slacks. Why don\u0027t you take a shower while I run all your clothes through the washing machine? Or is it a waste of time? I can get the stains out, but are there still traces that show up in a test?\"\n \"There may be,\" I said, \"but if the stains are invisible to the naked eye I\u0027d say that\u0027s enough. If we get to the point where they do spectroscopic tests on everything in my closet, it won\u0027t matter what they find. TJ left some blood on the floor at Tapscott Street, and they can tie him to it with a DNA match, so I\u0027m not going to worry about blood traces that nobody can see.\"\n I took a shower, then put on clean clothes and had a look at TJ. He was sleeping soundly and his color looked better. I put a hand on his forehead. It felt warm, but not dangerously so.\n In the living room, Elaine told me I shouldn\u0027t have bothered getting dressed. \"Because you have to sleep,\" she said. \"You can catch a few hours on the couch. I\u0027ll sit up with him, and then you can take over when the stores are open, and I\u0027ll go buy beets and carrots. I almost fell over when Jerry started telling me about beet juice.\" She took a moment, then said, \"He performed one of my abortions, but before that he was a client.\"\n \"I wasn\u0027t going to ask.\"\n \"I know, but why should you have to wonder? Speaking of having to wonder, do you think he\u0027s dead? The man in Brooklyn?\"\n \"He was well on his way when I left. I\u0027d say he\u0027s probably dead by now.\"\n \"Unless someone phoned for an ambulance.\"\n \"That seems unlikely. Even if they did, my guess is he\u0027d be dead at the scene or DOA at the hospital.\"\n \"Does it bother you?\"\n \"That he\u0027s dead?\"\n \"And that you didn\u0027t try to save him.\"\n \"No,\" I said. \"I don\u0027t think so. He killed Jim, you know.\"\n \"I know.\"\n \"You\u0027d think that would have filled me with rage when I stood there in front of him, but it didn\u0027t. He was just a problem to solve. He had some information I wanted. Or at least I thought he did at the time. It turned out he didn\u0027t know anything. He identified one sketch and got my hopes up, but then I showed him one Ray and I did as an exercise, someone completely out of the frame, and he ID\u0027d him, too. I could have shown him a picture of the Dalai Lama and he\u0027d have sworn that was the guy who set me up.\"\n \"He just wanted to get to the hospital.\"\n \"That\u0027s it. But the point is I didn\u0027t walk in with vengeance in mind. I fully intended to stiff him on the two grand, but I wasn\u0027t planning to shoot him. If he hadn\u0027t started firing, my gun would never have left the holster.\"\n \"But he did.\"\n \"But he did, and I shot the son of a bitch, and then he expected me to get him patched up. Well, the hell with that. I don\u0027t think I could have if I\u0027d wanted to, but why even make the effort? I hadn\u0027t been willing to kill him, but I was willing to let him die.\"\n \"He had it coming.\"\n \"You could probably say that about most people. Still, the guy\u0027s a poster child for the death penalty. He struck me as a pretty pure sociopath. He\u0027d kill anybody, just so you paid him. God knows how many people he killed in his life, and Jim wouldn\u0027t have been the last. He wouldn\u0027t even have been the last this week if I hadn\u0027t been wearing the vest.\"\n \"I was thinking that,\" she said, \"but I decided I\u0027m not going to allow myself any thoughts that start with if. There are too many of them and they\u0027re too upsetting. You\u0027re alive, thank God, and TJ\u0027s alive. That\u0027s enough for now.\"\n I got a few hours on the couch. They were fitful, with a lot of dreams that dispersed like smoke when I opened my eyes. TJ was alone in the bedroom, his features relaxed in sleep. For a moment he looked about twelve years old.\n Elaine was in the kitchen watching the news. \"Nothing about a dead man in Brownsville,\" she said.\n \"There wouldn\u0027t be. A black man dead of gunshot wounds in an abandoned building? Not the kind of item that makes a news director holler for a film crew.\"\n \"They\u0027ll investigate it, though.\"\n \"The police? Of course they will. You get any kind of a homicide, you try to clear it. This one\u0027s easy to read. Dead man on the floor, shot twice in the chest with a.38. Another gun nearby, a.22, recently fired, and several slugs from it there in the apartment.\"\n \"Oh?\"\n \"The two that the Kevlar vest stopped, plus one that missed both of us. They can dig it out of the wall if they want to take the trouble. Blood- the dead man\u0027s, and another person\u0027s, presumably the shooter.\"\n \"But we know better.\"\n \"And a blood trail, I\u0027d have to assume, leading out the door and down the stairs. Scenario\u0027s got to be that two men had an argument, probably over drugs or women- \"\n \"Because what else do grown men argue about.\"\n \"- and they shot each other, and the survivor decided not to stick around. It\u0027s certainly the kind of case you try to clear, but you don\u0027t knock yourself out. You wait until somebody says, \u0027Listen, what for you want to hassle me about ten dime bags of product when I\u0027m the man can give you the dude shot that Cayman dude over on Tapscott Street?\u0027 And you make your deal and pick up your perp.\"\n \"Cayman? Purvis was from the Cayman Islands?\"\n \"Just a guess. He was wearing a Georgetown University sweatshirt.\"\n \"So? That\u0027s in DC.\"\n \"Keep going.\"\n \"Georgetown is the capital of the Caymans,\" she said, after some thought. \"So if that\u0027s where you\u0027re from, a Georgetown University sweatshirt would be a hip thing to wear.\"\n \"Stands to reason.\"\n \"Of course it\u0027s also the capital of Guyana.\"\n \"It is?\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/everybody-dies-matthew-scudder-14/page-30.html","bookId":2332,"book":{"id":2332,"title":"Everybody Dies (Matthew Scudder #14)","description":"Storyline: \n Everybody Dies (Matthew Scudder #14) \n Matt Scudder is finally leading a comfortable life.
