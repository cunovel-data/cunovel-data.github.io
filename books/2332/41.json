{"id":64428,"no":41,"title":"Page 41","content":"I didn\u0027t see any way out but the way we\u0027d come in, but Mick struck off to the left, and the beam of his flashlight revealed a path. He had the canvas sack in one hand and the flashlight in the other, and I was carrying the second flashlight and had my other hand free. I had the revolver he\u0027d given me in my shoulder holster, and the little.22 automatic in my pocket. And I\u0027d kept one of the guns I\u0027d taken from Andy, another automatic, this one a 9mm. I was carrying it as he\u0027d carried it, under my waistband in the small of my back. The air was cool, and I was glad of the Kevlar vest if only for the warmth it provided. The ground was soft underfoot, the path narrow. Our own footfalls were the only sound I could hear, and it seemed to me we were making a lot of noise, although I couldn\u0027t see how it mattered. We were well out of earshot of anybody at the farm. After a long silence he said, \"He didn\u0027t have a priest. I wonder if it matters. We used to think it did, but there\u0027s much that\u0027s changed with the years. I doubt he cared whether he had a priest or not. Priest or no priest, he\u0027ll be seeing it now.\" \"Seeing…\" \"The picture of his life. If that\u0027s what happens. But who knows what happens? Though I suspect I\u0027ll find out soon enough.\" \"We both may.\" \"No,\" he said. \"You\u0027ll be all right.\" \"Is that a promise?\" \"It\u0027s the next thing to it,\" he said. \"You\u0027ll be home soon enough, sitting in your kitchen drinking coffee with your good woman. I\u0027ve a strong feeling about that.\" \"Another feeling.\" \"And there\u0027s a twin feeling alongside of it,\" he said. \"About myself.\" I didn\u0027t say anything. \"\u0027You\u0027ve the second sight,\u0027 my mother said, \u0027and right now it\u0027s a wonder to you, Mickey, but you\u0027ll find it\u0027s as much a curse as ever it was a blessing, for it will show you things you\u0027d sooner not see.\u0027 There were things she was wrong about, by God, but that was never one of them. I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll live to see the sun up, man.\" \"If you really believe that,\" I said, \"why don\u0027t we turn around and go home?\" \"We\u0027ll go on.\" \"Why?\" \"Because we must. Because I\u0027d have it no other way. Because if I\u0027m not afraid of the men and their guns, whyever should I be fearful of my own thoughts? And I have to tell you this. I don\u0027t mind dying.\" \"Oh?\" \"Whoever would have thought I\u0027d last this long? You\u0027d think someone would have killed me by now, or I\u0027d have died of my own recklessness. Oh, I had a good old run of it. There\u0027s things I did and wish I hadn\u0027t, and there\u0027s others I wished I\u0027d done and never will, but I wouldn\u0027t change the whole of it if I could. And just as well, because you never can, can you?\" Nor all your tears wash out a word of it… \"No,\" I said. \"You never can.\" \"I\u0027m lucky to have had what I\u0027ve had, and if it\u0027s over then it\u0027s over. And I\u0027ve seen too many men die to fear the act of dying. If there\u0027s pain, well, there\u0027s pain enough in life. I\u0027m not afraid of it.\" \"When you were in Ireland that time,\" I remembered, \"I had to trade a suitcase full of money for a kidnapped child, and I had to walk right up to a couple of guns in order to do it. The men with the guns were unstable, and one of them was crazy as a shit-house rat. I figured there was a very good chance I\u0027d die then and there. But I honestly wasn\u0027t afraid. I know I must have told you that, but did I ever tell you why?\" \"Tell me.\" \"It was a thought I had. I realized I\u0027d lived too long to die young. And I don\u0027t know why the hell I found that reassuring, but I did. And I wasn\u0027t afraid.\" \"And that was a few years ago,\" he said, \"and I\u0027m a couple of years older than yourself.\" He cleared his throat. \"I won\u0027t have a priest myself,\" he said. \"You know, I have to say that bothers me.\" \"Does it?\" \"Not the lack of some whey-faced lad in a dog collar to touch me on the forehead and send me fluttering off to Jesus,\" he said. \"I don\u0027t care about that. But I always had it in the back of my mind that I\u0027d get a chance to make a full confession before I died. I thought I\u0027d die easier with the weight of the sins off me.\" \"I see.\" \"Do you? You probably don\u0027t, not being brought up in the Faith. It\u0027s hard to explain Confession to someone who\u0027s not Catholic. What it is, and what it does for you.\" \"We have something like it in AA.\" \"Do you?\" He stopped dead in his tracks. \"But I never heard that. You have a sacrament of Confession? You go to priests and bare your souls?\" \"Not exactly,\" I said, \"but I think it amounts to essentially the same thing. There\u0027s a program of suggested steps.\" \"Twelve of them, isn\u0027t it?\" \"That\u0027s right. Not everybody pays attention to them, especially at first, when it\u0027s hard enough just staying away from the first drink. But people who work the steps seem to have a better chance of staying sober in the long run, so most people get to them sooner or later.\" \"And confession\u0027s a part of it?\" \"The fifth step,\" I said. \"The precise language of it- but do you really want to hear all this?\" \"Indeed I do.\" \"What you\u0027re supposed to do is admit to God, to yourself, and to another human being the exact nature of your wrongs.\" \"Your sins,\" he said. \"But how do you decide what\u0027s a sin?\" \"You figure it out for yourself,\" I said. \"There\u0027s no authority in AA. Nobody\u0027s in charge.\" \"The lunatics are running the asylum.\" \"That\u0027s about it. And how you approach the step is open to interpretation. The advice I got was to write down everything I ever did in my life that bothered me.\" \"By God, wouldn\u0027t your hand be cramped up by the time you were done?\" \"That\u0027s exactly what happened. Then I sat down with my notes in front of me and talked it all out with another person.\" \"A priest?\" \"Some people do it with a clergyman. In the early days that was the usual way. Nowadays most people take the step with their sponsor.\" \"Is that what you did?\" \"Yes.\" \"And that was the Buddhist fellow? Why can I never remember the poor man\u0027s name?\" \"Jim Faber.\" \"And you told him every bad thing you ever did.\" \"Pretty much. There were a few things that I didn\u0027t think of until later on, but I told him everything I could remember at the time.\" \"And then what? He gave you absolution?\" \"No, he just listened.\" \"Ah.\" \"And then he said, \u0027Well, that\u0027s it. How do you feel now?\u0027 And I said I thought I felt about the same. And he said why don\u0027t we go get some coffee, and we did, and that was that. But later I felt…\" \"Relieved?\" \"I think so, yes.\" He nodded. \"I\u0027d no idea your lot did any of that,\" he said. \"It\u0027s a good bit like Confession, but there\u0027s more ritual and formality our way. No surprise, eh? There\u0027s more ritual and formality to everything we do. You\u0027ve never done it our way, have you?\" \"No, of course not.\" \"\u0027No, of course not.\u0027 There\u0027s no \u0027of course\u0027 about it with you, is there? You\u0027ve been to Mass with me. More than that, you took Holy Communion. Do ye even remember that?\" \"I wouldn\u0027t be likely to forget it.\" \"Nor I myself! By God, what a strange fucking time that was. The two of us fresh from Maspeth with blood on our hands, and there we were at St. Bernard\u0027s at the Butchers\u0027 Mass, staying put as we always did while the others went up to take the wafer. And all of a sudden there you are, on your feet and on your way to the altar rail, and I a step behind you. I with decades of sins unconfessed, and you an unbaptized heathen altogether, and we took Communion!\" \"I don\u0027t know why I did it.\" \"And I never knew why I followed you! And yet I felt wonderful afterwards. I couldn\u0027t tell you why, but I did.\" \"So did I. I never did anything like that again.\" \"I should hope not,\" he said. \"Neither did I, you may rest assured of that.\" We walked a little ways in silence, and then he said, \"Ritual and formality, as I was saying. \u0027Bless me, Father, for I have sinned,\u0027 is what I\u0027d say as a way of starting. \u0027It has been forty years and more since my last confession.\u0027 Sweet Jesus, forty years!\" I didn\u0027t say anything. \"And then I don\u0027t know what I\u0027d say. I don\u0027t think there\u0027s a commandment I\u0027ve not broken. Oh, I\u0027ve kept my hands off the altar boys, and that\u0027s more I guess than some of the priests can say for themselves, but I can take no credit for that as it\u0027s been lack of inclination that\u0027s spared them. I suppose I could go through the list, commandment by commandment.\" \"Some people do the Fifth Step by going through the list of deadly sins. You know, pride, greed, anger, gluttony…\" \"It might be easier. There\u0027s seven sins, and that\u0027s three fewer than the commandments. I like your way, though. Just saying the sins that are weighing on your soul. Well, I\u0027ve enough of those. I\u0027ve lived a bad life and done bad things.\" A twig snapped underfoot, and I heard something scurry in the brush, some small animal we\u0027d startled. Off in the distance I heard what must have been the hooting of an owl. I don\u0027t think I ever heard one before. He stopped walking, leaned his back against a tree. \"One time,\" he said, \"I was trying to get this man to talk. He had money hidden and he wouldn\u0027t say where it was. Hurting him only seemed to strengthen his will. And so I reached in and took his eye out, plucked it right out of his head, and I held it in the palm of my hand and showed it to him. \u0027Your eye is looking at you,\u0027 I said, \u0027and it can see right into your soul. Now shall I take the other one as well?\u0027 And he talked, and we got the money, and I put the barrel of my gun to his empty eye socket and blew out his brains.\" He fell silent, and his words hung in the air around us, until the breeze could waft them away. \"And then there was another time,\" he said… I\u0027ve forgotten almost everything he said. I can\u0027t explain how that happened. It\u0027s not as though I wasn\u0027t paying attention. How could I have done otherwise? The wedding guest could have more easily ignored the Ancient Mariner. Even so, the words he spoke passed through my consciousness and flew off somewhere. It was as if I was a channel, a conduit for his confession. Maybe that\u0027s how it is for priests and psychiatrists, who hear such revelations regularly. Or maybe not. I couldn\u0027t say. We walked and he talked, sometimes at great length, sometimes quite tersely. There was a point when we reached a clearing and sat on the ground, and he went on talking and I went on listening. And then there was a point when he was done. \"A longer walk than I remembered it,\" he said. \"It\u0027s slower going at night, and we stopped now and then along the way, didn\u0027t we? The stream\u0027s my property line. It\u0027s just a dry ditch in the heat of summer, and a regular torrent when the snows melt in the spring. Let\u0027s find a place to cross it where we won\u0027t get our feet wet.\" And we managed, stepping on a couple of rocks. \"After he heard you out, your Buddhist friend,\" he began, and caught himself. \"Jim Faber, that is to say.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/everybody-dies-matthew-scudder-14/page-41.html","bookId":2332,"book":{"id":2332,"title":"Everybody Dies (Matthew Scudder #14)","description":"Storyline: Everybody Dies (Matthew Scudder #14) Matt Scudder is finally leading a comfortable life.
