{"id":64418,"no":31,"title":"Page 31","content":"\"Uh-huh. So maybe he\u0027s Guyanese.\" \"Maybe,\" I said. \"Then again, maybe he stole the shirt.\" \"I used to like the Caymans,\" she said, \"back when a suntan was considered sexy, instead of precancerous. He\u0027s been sleeping pretty soundly. He woke up one time when I was taking his temperature and I got him to drink some water, and then he went right back to sleep. He\u0027s running a slight fever, a little over a degree.\" \"I think that\u0027s to be expected.\" \"Yes, I\u0027d say so. One of us has to go buy beets and carrots.\" I said I\u0027d go. The place she sent me was on Ninth Avenue near Forty-fourth. It was an oversized health food store with a big produce section and no end of herbs and vitamins. There was probably something on the shelves that would have him healed overnight without even a scar, but I didn\u0027t have a clue what it was or where to look for it. I bought enough beets and carrots to fill two shopping bags and took a cab home. She had the juicer set up by the time I got there, and I watched as she washed beets and carrots and cut them up and ran them through the thing. The result may have been half carrot but all you could see was the beet, dark and purplish as blood from a vein. She went into the bedroom with a big glass of the stuff and I tagged along to see how much of a fight he put up. \"This is beet juice,\" she said, \"mixed with carrot. The doctor said you have to drink it to replace the blood you lost.\" He looked at her. \"Like a transfusion?\" \"But without the needles and tubes.\" \"Doc said so? Same one as was here before?\" She said yes, and he took the glass from her and drank it off in two swallows. \"It ain\u0027t bad,\" he said, sounding surprised. \"Kind of sweet. What you say it was? Beet and carrot?\" \"That\u0027s right. Could you drink some more?\" \"I believe I could,\" he said. \"Got a powerful thirst.\" While she prepared it I helped him to the bathroom, then back to bed. He couldn\u0027t believe how weak he was, or how much the few steps to the john and back exhausted him. \"It\u0027s just a flesh wound,\" he said. \"Ain\u0027t that what they say? Then they up and runnin\u0027 like nothin\u0027 ever happened.\" \"That\u0027s in the movies.\" \"Anyway,\" he said, \"they all flesh wounds, \u0027cause that\u0027s what folks is made out of. Wha\u0027d the doe give me, you happen to know? A. person could do okay sellin\u0027 it on the street.\" \"Don\u0027t tell the doc,\" I said. \"He might try it.\" We nursed him through the day. Elaine napped on the couch and I took a turn watching him sleep and talking with him when he was awake. His fever rose during the afternoon, and when it hit 102° Elaine called Froelich. He said he\u0027d be over in two hours, but to call him again if it reached 104° before then. But it broke, and when the doctor arrived and took his temperature it was normal. Froelich changed the dressing, said the wound was healing nicely, and told TJ he should consider himself lucky. \"If it had hit the artery,\" he said, \"you could have bled out. If it hit the bone, you could be laid up for a month.\" \"If it missed me completely,\" TJ said, \"I could be out playin\u0027 basketball.\" \"You\u0027re too short,\" Froelich told him. \"These days they\u0027re all giants. Keep doing what you\u0027ve been doing, and stay with the beet juice. Incidentally, it\u0027ll color your urine.\" \"Yeah, well, I found that out. Thought I was bleedin\u0027 to death, Beth, and then it came to me where I seen that color before. I\u0027d been drinkin\u0027 it by the quart.\" He dozed off after the doctor left, and I wound up taking an unpremeditated nap of my own in front of the TV set. When I woke up Elaine reported that he was starting to complain a little, and she took it for a sign of recovery. \"He says if he was in his own place, meaning across the street, he could check his e-mail and keep up with some message boards, whatever they are.\" \"It\u0027s a computer thing,\" I said. \"You wouldn\u0027t understand.\" We spent a quiet evening at home. TJ had an appetite, and finished a second portion of the lasagna. He also had the idea he could get to and from the bathroom on his own, and asked if Elaine still had the cane she\u0027d used in the spring when she sprained her ankle. She found it and he took a couple of hesitant steps with it and saw it wasn\u0027t going to work. His wound was too raw for him to put any weight at all on that leg. The phone rang intermittently. We let the machine pick up, and half the time the caller rang off without leaving a message. Maybe it was some phone sales rep who wanted to talk us into switching long-distance carriers, or maybe it was someone reluctant to issue death threats to an answering machine. I didn\u0027t waste a lot of time worrying about it. Then right around midnight it rang, and after the recorded message and the tone there was a pause that seemed eternal, but was probably only five or six seconds. Then a voice I knew said, \"Ah, \u0027tis I. Are you there then?\" I picked up and talked to him, put down the receiver and found Elaine. \"It\u0027s Mick,\" I said. \"He\u0027s in his car, driving around. He wants to come by and pick me up.\" \"Did you tell him yes?\" \"I haven\u0027t told him anything yet.\" \"TJ\u0027s much better,\" she said. \"I can manage here. And it\u0027s not over yet, is it? TJ was shot, and the man who shot Jim is dead, but it\u0027s not over till it\u0027s over. Isn\u0027t that what they say?\" \"That\u0027s what they say. And no, it\u0027s not over.\" \"Then you\u0027d better go,\" she said. I waited in the lobby and watched the street while the midnight-to-eight doorman shared his views on global warming. I can\u0027t remember the thread of his argument, but he saw it as a direct result of the collapse of world communism. Then Andy Buckley\u0027s battered Caprice pulled up at the curb, and started rolling again as soon as I was inside it. The night was clear and cool and I caught a glimpse of the moon. It was gibbous, and just about the same shape as it had been the night we dug the grave. It had been waxing then and now it was on the wane. \"Andy was trying to reach you,\" I remembered to tell him. \"He wanted your number, but I let him think I didn\u0027t have it.\" \"When was this?\" \"Yesterday, early evening. Have you talked to him since?\" \"Yesterday and today as well. He had the Cadillac and wanted to trade cars.\" \"So he said.\" \"I told him he had the better of the deal, but he was afraid to park the thing for fear some harm would come to it. Least of my worries, I said, but he would have none of it. He put it back in the garage and now he\u0027s driving some old wreck of his cousin\u0027s.\" \"That\u0027s what he said he was going to do.\" We\u0027d turned on Broadway and were heading downtown. \"Now where\u0027ll we go?\" he wondered. \"Just so we\u0027re going somewhere and doing something. It\u0027s the inactivity drives a man mad. Knowing the other side is up to something, whoever they are, and not knowing what, and doing not a thing about it. I sat up all last night with a bottle and a glass. I don\u0027t mind drinking and I don\u0027t mind drinking alone, but I wasn\u0027t doing it for the pleasure of it. It was out of boredom, and that class of drinking is deadening to the soul.\" \"I know what you mean.\" \"You did some of the same in your day, did you? And lived to tell the tale. What luck have you had with the detecting? Are we any closer to knowing what we\u0027re up against?\" \"We know more than we did,\" I said. \"TJ found out a few things about the Vietnamese who shot up the bar, and we\u0027ve got a line out for something on his partner.\" \"The bomb thrower, that would be.\" \"That\u0027s right. And I\u0027ve got a sketch of one of the two men who mugged me.\" \"They were the ones mugged, by the time it was over.\" I let that go. \"I\u0027ve got a sketch,\" I said, \"but so far no one\u0027s recognized it. There were a lot of things I might have done today, but I had to spend it at home taking care of TJ.\" \"Why, for the love of God? Hasn\u0027t he managed for years taking care of himself?\" \"Oh, of course, we haven\u0027t talked since then. How could you know?\" \"How could I know what?\" \"He was shot last night,\" I said. \"Fucking Jesus,\" he said, and hit the brake pedal. A car behind us braked hard, and the driver leaned on his horn. \"Aaah, fuck yourself,\" Mick told him, and demanded to know what had happened. I told him the whole story. I broke it off when we got to McGinley \u0026 Caldecott, resumed the narration after we\u0027d stowed the car in its parking space and made our way down the stairs and through the narrow aisle to the office. He poured himself a drink, and from a table-model refrigerator he produced a can of Perrier. \"They didn\u0027t have bottles,\" he said. \"Only the cans. It should be all right, don\u0027t you think?\" \"I\u0027m sure it\u0027ll be fine. I\u0027ve been known to drink tap water in a pinch, as far as that goes.\" \"Nasty stuff,\" he said. \"You don\u0027t know where it\u0027s been. Get on with it, man. You left him for dead, the black bastard?\" \"He was on his way out. He couldn\u0027t have lasted long. It was black comedy, now that I think about it. The two of us stood there snarling \u0027fuck you\u0027 at each other. I can\u0027t swear to it, but I think those were his last words.\" \"I wouldn\u0027t doubt they\u0027re the last words of more than a few of us.\" I told him how TJ\u0027d been shot, and how I got him home. \"I put a gun to the cabdriver\u0027s head,\" I said, \"and at the end of the ride he gave me his card and said to call him anytime, any hour of the day or night. I love New York.\" \"There\u0027s no place can touch it for people.\" When I was finished he sat back in his chair and looked at the drink in his hand. \"It must have gone hard when you turned to the boy and saw he\u0027d been shot.\" \"It was strange,\" I said. \"I\u0027d just been shot twice myself and watched the bullets bounce off. And I\u0027d shot back and my bullets didn\u0027t bounce off, and I felt as though I was in charge of the world. Then I turned around and the bottom fell out, because while I\u0027d been feeling like the master of the universe TJ\u0027s blood was oozing out between his fingers, and I didn\u0027t even know what was going on.\" \"He\u0027s a son to you, isn\u0027t he?\" \"Is he? I don\u0027t know. I\u0027ve already got sons, two of them. I wasn\u0027t around much when they were growing up and I don\u0027t see much of them now. Michael\u0027s out in California and Andy\u0027s in a different place every time I hear from him. I don\u0027t know that I\u0027ve installed TJ in their place, but I suppose he\u0027s a sort of surrogate son. To Elaine, certainly. She mothers him, and he doesn\u0027t seem to mind.\" \"Why should he?\" \"I don\u0027t know that I act like a father to him. More like a crusty old uncle. Our relationship\u0027s fairly ritualized. We joke around a lot, trade good-natured insults.\" \"He loves you.\" \"I suppose he does.\" \"And you love him.\" \"I suppose I do.\" \"I never had a son. There was a time I got a girl in trouble and she went off and had the baby and put it up for adoption. I never heard if it was a boy or girl she had. I never cared.\" He drank some whiskey. \"I was young. What did I care about children? I wanted only to be left alone, and she went off and had the child and gave it away, and I heard no more about it. Which was as much as I cared to hear.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/everybody-dies-matthew-scudder-14/page-31.html","bookId":2332,"book":{"id":2332,"title":"Everybody Dies (Matthew Scudder #14)","description":"Storyline: Everybody Dies (Matthew Scudder #14) Matt Scudder is finally leading a comfortable life.
