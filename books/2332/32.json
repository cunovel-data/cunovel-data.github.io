But every now and then I\u0027ll find myself wondering. Not what might have been, but just wondering how the wee one turned out, and what sort of a life it had. Night thoughts, you know. Nobody has such thoughts in the light of day.\"\n \"You\u0027re right about that.\"\n \"For all I know for certain,\" he said, \"it may not have been my child at all. She was an aisy sort of a girl, if you know the word.\"\n \"Same as easy?\"\n \"I\u0027d say it\u0027s the same word, but there\u0027s a softer sense to it when you say it the Irish way. An aisy girl. She swore it was me put her in the club, but how could she be sure? And how could I?\" He looked at my can of Perrier and asked me if I wanted a glass for it. \"You can\u0027t drink water straight out of a can,\" he said, and found a clean tumbler in a cupboard, and poured the water into it for me, and assured me it was better that way.\n \"Thanks,\" I said.\n \"Years later,\" he said, \"there was another one I got in the family way, and I never heard about it until she told me she\u0027d got rid of it. Had an abortion, you know. Jesus, that\u0027s a sin, I told her. I don\u0027t believe that, says she, and if it is then the sin\u0027s on me. Why didn\u0027t you tell me, says I. Mickey, says she, to what end? You weren\u0027t about to marry me. Well, she was right about that. You\u0027d only have tried to talk me out of it, says she, and I\u0027d already made up my mind. Then why tell me at all, says I. Well, says she, I thought you\u0027d want to know. I\u0027ll tell you, man, women are the strangest creatures God ever put on the earth.\"\n \"Amen,\" I said.\n \"There\u0027s a saying, or mayhaps it\u0027s the words of a song. It holds there are three things a man must do in the course of a lifetime. Plant a tree, marry a woman, and father a son. Well, I\u0027ve planted trees. In the orchard, and then I put in a great windbreak of hemlock, and I planted horse chestnut trees along the drive. I don\u0027t know how many trees I\u0027ve planted, but I\u0027d call it a fair number.\" He lowered his eyes. \"I never found a woman I cared to marry. And never fathered a child. Even if it was my baby she had, it takes more than that to make a true father of a man. So I\u0027ll have to be content with my trees.\"\n \"Then again, your life\u0027s not over yet.\"\n \"No,\" he said. \"Not yet.\"\n A little later he said, \"You killed the man who killed your friend. Good for you.\"\n \"I don\u0027t know if it was good for me. It was better for me than it was for him, I\u0027ll say that much.\"\n \"I wouldn\u0027t have left him breathing, myself. Even if it was his last breaths he was taking. I\u0027d have put one more bullet into him to make sure.\"\n \"It never occurred to me. I wasn\u0027t planning on killing him.\"\n \"How could you not? He killed your friend.\"\n \"Well, I\u0027ve killed him now, and Jim\u0027s still dead. So what difference did it make?\"\n \"It made a difference.\"\n \"I wonder.\"\n \"What the hell were you going to do? Pay him two thousand dollars and shake his bloody hand?\"\n \"I wasn\u0027t going to shake hands with him. And I wasn\u0027t going to pay him the money. I was going to stiff him.\"\n \"And then turn your back on him and walk out the door? How did you expect him to take it?\"\n I was silent for a moment, thinking long thoughts. Then I said, \"You know, maybe I set it up, and set myself up in the bargain. I didn\u0027t consciously intend to kill him. When I walked in there and saw him I couldn\u0027t even manage to hate him. It\u0027d be like hating a scorpion for stinging you. It\u0027s what they do, so what else can you expect from him?\"\n \"Still, you\u0027d grind that scorpion under your heel.\"\n \"Maybe it\u0027s not a good analogy. Or maybe it is, I don\u0027t know. But I wonder if I knew all along that I was going to kill him, and if I stage-managed things to give myself an excuse. Once he drew on me, I had permission. I wasn\u0027t murdering him, I wasn\u0027t executing him. It was self-defense.\"\n \"And it was.\"\n \"Not if I made him draw.\"\n \"You didn\u0027t make him draw, for Jesus\u0027 sake! You offered him money.\"\n \"I told him I had the money on me, and I let him know I was the man he was supposed to kill. Isn\u0027t that baiting the trap? If I wanted to keep him from drawing on me, all I had to do was walk in there with a gun in my hand. I had every chance in the world to get the drop on him and I didn\u0027t take it.\"\n \"You didn\u0027t expect him to try anything.\"\n \"But I should have. What else could he be expected to do? And the fact of the matter is I did expect it. I must have, because I was already reaching for my gun by the time he came up with his. Somehow or other I anticipated his response or I could never have responded so quickly myself. He opened fire, and that was my excuse, and I gunned him down.\"\n \"I hear what you\u0027re saying.\"\n \"And?\"\n \"And whoever knows the reasons why we do what we do? I\u0027ll say this much. If you blame yourself for killing the bastard, you\u0027re off your head.\"\n \"I blame myself for getting TJ shot.\"\n \"Ah, I never took that into account. Still, who\u0027s to say it\u0027s not for the best?\" I looked at him, puzzled. \"What the soldiers call a million-dollar wound,\" he explained. \"For he\u0027s out of it now, isn\u0027t he? And should live to tell the tale.\"\n A little later he said, \"\u0027Twas the vest saved you, was it?\"\n \"The shirt I was wearing was ruined,\" I said. \"But the vest stopped both rounds.\"\n \"They say it won\u0027t stop a knife thrust.\"\n \"So I understand. It\u0027s a kind of fabric, and evidently a knife blade can pierce it. I suppose the same thing would be true of an ice pick.\"\n \"Is it heavy? Like wearing a coat of mail?\"\n \"It\u0027s not featherweight.\" I unbuttoned my shirt and let him examine the vest, then buttoned it up again. \"It\u0027s an extra layer,\" I said, \"and might be welcome on a cold day. On a warm day, you\u0027re tempted to leave it at home.\"\n \"It\u0027s a great thing, science. They make a vest that can stop a bullet, and next they make a bullet that can pierce a vest. It\u0027s the same as armies are forever doing, but on a more personal level. A good thing you were wearing one last night.\"\n \"Do you want one? Because they\u0027re easy enough to buy, and nobody has to teach you how to use it. You just put it on.\"\n \"Where would you get one?\"\n \"The cop shops have them. I went downtown, but there\u0027s one on Second Avenue near the academy, and others in the other boroughs. What\u0027s the matter?\"\n \"I\u0027m just seeing myself walking into a cop shop. They\u0027d never let me walk out again.\"\n \"I\u0027d pick one up for you, if you want.\"\n \"Would they ever have my size?\"\n \"I\u0027m sure they would.\"\n He thought about it, then let out a sigh. \"I wouldn\u0027t wear it,\" he said.\n \"Why not?\"\n \"Because I never would. Because I\u0027m a fool, I suppose, but it\u0027s the way I am. I\u0027d have it in mind that I was trying to get the best of the Lord, and that He\u0027d show me who\u0027s boss by making sure I got shot in the head, or done with a knife or an ice pick.\"\n \"Like Achilles.\"\n \"Just so. The heel was the only vulnerable part of him. And so he was shot in the heel, and died of it.\"\n \"That\u0027s superstition though, isn\u0027t it?\"\n \"Didn\u0027t I say I was a fool? And a superstitious one in the bargain. Ah, there\u0027s differences between us, man. When you get in a car you always fasten your seat belt.\"\n \"And a good thing, too, when you stop short the way you did tonight.\"\n \"Didn\u0027t you give me a turn, though, saying the boy was shot? But the point is that you always wear a seat belt and I never do. I can\u0027t bear the feeling of being confined that way.\"\n \"A vest wouldn\u0027t confine you any more than a shirt does. It would just keep bullets out.\"\n \"I\u0027m not explaining it well.\"\n \"No, I guess I understand.\"\n \"I just don\u0027t want to do what I should,\" he said. \"I\u0027m a contrary bastard. That\u0027s all.\"\n \"There\u0027s just the four of us,\" he said. \"Tom and Andy and yourself and myself.\"\n \"Don\u0027t you have anybody else?\"\n \"I\u0027ve people who work for me, or do the odd job. They\u0027ll head for the hills now there\u0027s a war on, and why shouldn\u0027t they? They\u0027re not soldiers at all, they\u0027re what you could call civilian employees. So that\u0027s four of us, and who knows how many there are of them?\"\n \"Fewer than there used to be.\"\n \"We each did for one, didn\u0027t we? Though the one you shot was hired help, and the same could be true of the Vietnamese. Wasn\u0027t he the murderous little bastard?\" He shook his head. \"I wonder how many that leaves. More than four, I\u0027d guess.\"\n \"You\u0027re probably right.\"\n \"So we\u0027re outnumbered, and outgunned as well if that automatic rifle of his is anything to go by.\"\n \"Except you took it, didn\u0027t you? So it\u0027s ours now.\"\n \"And small use to us, with the clip close to empty. I should have seen if he had a spare in his pocket. Although as I recall we were in a bit of a hurry.\"\n \"You saved my life that night.\"\n \"Ah, go on with you.\"\n \"Just stating a fact.\"\n \"What did we say when we were kids? \u0027I saved your life the other day, I killed a shit-eating dog.\u0027 I\u0027m glad childhood comes early in life because I\u0027d hate to go through it now. Tell me something. What did you think of that movie?\"\n \"To change the subject.\"\n \"It could do with changing. Did you care for it?\"\n \"What movie was that?\"\n \"Michael Collins. Didn\u0027t you tell me you rented the video?\"\n \"I thought it was good.\"\n \"Did you? It was all true, you know.\"\n \"I was wondering about that.\"\n \"They took the odd liberty. The scene in Croke Park, when the British rake the crowd with gunfire? In fact they used a machine gun, not the revolving gun in the armored car. It was an image sticks in your mind, the way they did it, but what happened was terrible enough.\"\n \"It\u0027s hard to believe it happened at all.\"\n \"Oh, it happened well enough. The other thing they did, they had his friend Harry Boland die in the fighting at the Four Courts. Collins\u0027s friend, he dives into the Liffey and a soldier shoots him?\"\n \"I remember.\"\n \"\u0027Twas years later he died, long after Collins was buried. He lived to be a minister in Dev\u0027s government. He was a sanctimonious bastard, Dev. Your man who played him had him just right. Even looked like him.\" He took a drink. \"He was the best of them. Collins, I mean. He was a fucking genius.\"\n \"When he wiped out the British agents,\" I said. \"Was that part accurate? Killing them all the same day?\"\n \"That was the genius of it! He had his spy in Dublin Castle, yes, but then he gathered his information and bided his time. And killed all of the flickers of a Sunday morning. It was over before they knew it had begun.\" He shook his head. \"Listen to me, will you? You\u0027d think I knew him. He was dead and in his grave fifteen years before I was born. But I\u0027ve studied him, you know. I\u0027ve heard the old men\u0027s stories and I\u0027ve read books. You start off with a lot of heroes, you know, and then you learn a bit about them and they\u0027re heroes no more. But I\u0027ve never ceased to admire Collins. I wish… no, you\u0027ll think it too queer.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/everybody-dies-matthew-scudder-14/page-32.html","bookId":2332,"book":{"id":2332,"title":"Everybody Dies (Matthew Scudder #14)","description":"Storyline: \n Everybody Dies (Matthew Scudder #14) \n Matt Scudder is finally leading a comfortable life.
