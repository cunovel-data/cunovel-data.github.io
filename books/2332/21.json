{"id":64408,"no":21,"title":"Page 21","content":"\"Never found the body, did they?\" \"No.\" \"Or the head, I guess.\" \"Or the head.\" He considered this. \"You ever been bowlin\u0027?\" \"Bowling? Not in years and years. There was a cops\u0027 league in Suffolk County when I lived in Syosset. I was on a team for a few months.\" \"Yeah? You have one of those shirts, got your name on the pocket?\" \"I don\u0027t remember.\" \"\u0027I don\u0027t remember.\u0027 That means you did, Sid, and you don\u0027t want to admit it.\" \"No, it means I don\u0027t remember. We ordered shirts for everybody, but I had to quit the team when I got a gold shield and my hours changed.\" \"And you didn\u0027t bowl no more after that?\" \"Once that I remember. I was off the police force and living at the hotel, and a friend of mine named Skip Devoe was always organizing things.\" I turned to Elaine. \"Did you ever meet Skip?\" \"No, but you\u0027ve talked about him.\" \"He was an owner of a joint on Ninth and a hell of a fellow. He\u0027d get a bee in his bonnet, and the next thing you knew we\u0027d all be traipsing out to Belmont for the racing, or to Randall\u0027s Island for an outdoor jazz concert. There used to be a bowling alley on the west side of Eighth two or three doors up from Fifty-seventh, and he got it in his head we had to go bowling, and the next thing you knew half a dozen drunks descended upon the place.\" \"And you just went the once?\" \"Just the one time. But we talked about it for weeks after.\" \"What became of him?\" \"Skip? He died a couple of years later. Acute pancreatitis, but then they never put on the death certificate that the deceased died of a broken heart. The story\u0027s too long to tell right now. Besides, Elaine\u0027s already heard it.\" \"And the bowlin\u0027 alley\u0027s gone.\" \"Long gone, along with the building it was in.\" \"I bowled once,\" he said. \"Felt like a fool. Looked so easy, and then I couldn\u0027t do it.\" \"You get the hang of it.\" \"I can see how you would, and then you just be tryin\u0027 to do the same thing over and over again. I see \u0027em sometimes on television, and those dudes are really good at it, and I keep waitin\u0027 for \u0027em to nod off in the middle of the game. How\u0027d we get on this subject?\" \"You brought it up.\" \"The bag. They never found the head, I was wonderin\u0027 did they ever find the bag. Don\u0027t matter if they did or didn\u0027t. Point is, that\u0027s a nice friend you got.\" \"You\u0027ve met him.\" \"Yeah.\" \"He\u0027s who he is,\" I said. \"He can be very charming, but he\u0027s a lifelong criminal and he\u0027s got a lot of blood on his hands.\" \"Times I met him,\" he said, \"was when I was with you, an\u0027 we fell by that place of his that got trashed.\" \"Grogan\u0027s.\" \"Didn\u0027t see a lot of black folks there.\" \"No.\" \"Not workin\u0027 there, not havin\u0027 a drink there.\" \"No.\" \"Dude was polite to me an\u0027 all, but all the time I was there I was real conscious of what color I was.\" \"I can see how you would be,\" I said. \"Mick\u0027s an Irish kid from a bad neighborhood, and those were the people who hanged black men from lampposts during the Civil War draft riots. He\u0027s not likely to decorate the windows for Martin Luther King Day.\" \"Probably uses the N word a lot.\" \"He does.\" \"Nigger nigger nigger,\" he said. \"Sounds silly when you say it over and over.\" \"Most any word does. What you say, he\u0027s who he is. We\u0027s all of us that.\" \"But you might not care to work for him.\" \"Not in his bar, Lamar. But then it don\u0027t look like it gone be open for business anytime soon. But that ain\u0027t the way you mean.\" \"No.\" \"We was workin\u0027 for him a couple days ago, wasn\u0027t we? He much more of a racist now than he was then?\" \"Probably not.\" \"So why would I all of a sudden not want to be workin\u0027 for the man?\" \"Because it\u0027s dangerous and illegal,\" Elaine said. \"You could have some major trouble with the police, and you could even get killed.\" He grinned. \"Well, all that\u0027s cool,\" he said, \"but I just know there\u0027s gotta be a downside.\" \"You think that\u0027s funny, don\u0027t you?\" \"So do you, or you wouldn\u0027t be tryin\u0027 so hard to keep from laughin\u0027.\" To me he said, \"What we gonna do, exactly? Grab some guns and head for the OK Corral?\" I shook my head. \"I don\u0027t think either of us is cut out for that,\" I said. \"There will probably come a time for that, and it\u0027ll be tip to somebody else to do it. Right now, though, nobody knows where the OK Corral is, or who\u0027s holed up there.\" \"Was the Clantons, way I remember it.\" \"This time around the Clantons don\u0027t have names or faces. What\u0027s called for is some detective work.\" \"An\u0027 we the detectives,\" he said. He scratched his head. \"We didn\u0027t get too far with E-Z Storage. Fact, we took it as far as we could and signed off the case.\" \"We haven\u0027t got much more now than we did then, but there are a few things.\" \"Dude who shot your friend.\" \"That\u0027s one. Right now the main thing we know about him is he\u0027s black.\" \"Narrows it down.\" \"It does, as a matter of fact, because we also know he\u0027s a professional. And he screwed up, he shot the wrong person.\" \"Word might get around.\" \"It might,\" I agreed. \"Second, there\u0027s the gunman at Grogan\u0027s.\" \"Asian dude.\" \"Southeast Asian, from the looks of him.\" \"That\u0027s right, you saw the man. I was thinkin\u0027 they didn\u0027t show his face on the TV, but you got to see him up close.\" \"Closer than I\u0027d have liked. They haven\u0027t released his name or anything about him, but that doesn\u0027t mean they don\u0027t know it.\" \"Get his name, trace him back, see who he used to hang out with.\" \"That\u0027s the idea. Our third opening\u0027s the two guys who jumped me a few blocks from here.\" \"Pounded on you, till you went and pounded on them.\" \"I got a good look at one of them,\" I said. \"I\u0027d recognize him again.\" \"You figure he lives in New York?\u0027 \"He\u0027d pretty much have to. Why?\" \"\u0027Cause that\u0027s how we\u0027ll do it, Hewitt. Just drive around lookin\u0027 at people, an\u0027 pick him out of the eight million faces we see.\" \"Well, that\u0027s one way.\" \"But you can think of another.\" \"I can,\" I said. \"The trouble is, it\u0027s not a whole lot better than your way.\" \"Well, we flexible,\" he said. \"We try your way, an\u0027 if it don\u0027t work we try mine.\" \"George Wister\u0027s not a bad guy,\" Joe Durkin said. \"A good cop and a bright fellow. He doesn\u0027t know what to make of you. You want to know something? I\u0027m not so sure I know what to make of you myself.\" \"What do you mean?\" \"You were having dinner with your friend last night. You went to the can and he got shot. And you couldn\u0027t think of a reason on earth why somebody\u0027d want to kill good old Jim.\" \"I still can\u0027t.\" \"Bullshit,\" he said. \"That the same jacket you were wearing last night?\" \"So?\" \"Same as your friend had on. Don\u0027t jerk me around, will you? You were the intended vic. Only reason you\u0027re here now is you picked the right time to take a leak.\" We were in a Greek coffee shop on Eighth, just a block down from the Lucky Panda. I\u0027d have preferred a different meeting place, but I\u0027d already rejected his first suggestion, the squad room at Midtown North, and he hadn\u0027t liked my idea of getting out of the neighborhood altogether and meeting somewhere down in Chelsea or the Village. When I\u0027d got there he was at a back booth, drinking coffee and halfway through a piece of cherry cheesecake. He said it was good and I ought to have some, but I told the waiter I\u0027d just have a cup of coffee. Joe said it was good we\u0027d stayed in the neighborhood, that it was going to rain. I said they kept predicting rain and it kept not raining. He said they\u0027d be right sooner or later, and the guy brought my coffee and we got down to it. Now I said, \"I guess that\u0027s true. I was evidently the shooter\u0027s actual target.\" \"It took you until today to figure that out?\" \"Wister suggested as much last night. In an offhand way, after he\u0027d gotten through floating the idea that Jim had been printing up green cards and bearer bonds for the Five Families. I took it about as seriously.\" \"When did you change your mind?\" \"When I talked to Mick Ballou.\" \"Your friend,\" \"He\u0027s a friend of mine, yes. You know that.\" \"And you know what I think about it. A lot of guys on the job have made themselves grief that way, having friends like that. Buddies from the old neighborhood, guys who went one way while they went another.\" \"I\u0027m not on the job anymore, Joe.\" \"No, you\u0027re not.\" \"And Ballou and I don\u0027t go back that far. I put in my papers years before I met him.\" \"And the two of you just hit it off, huh?\" \"Since when do I have to explain my friendships to you? You\u0027re a friend of mine, and I don\u0027t get a grilling from Ballou on the subject.\" \"Is that a fact? I guess he\u0027s more broad-minded than I am. Where were we? You were saying you changed your mind when you talked to your good friend the murderer. When was this?\" \"After I finished with Wister. I stopped at his place on my way home.\" \"Not exactly on your way. You walked over to Ninth and turned left instead of right I don\u0027t suppose you dropped in for a drink.\" \"I\u0027d just lost one friend and felt the need to say hello to another,\" I said. \"And when I got there he told me how he\u0027d been having problems.\" \"Oh?\" \"There was a fellow who did some odds and ends for him who wound up in a garbage can on Eleventh Avenue.\" \"Peter Rooney, and the odds and ends had to do with Ballou\u0027s shylocking operation. What\u0027d he do, hold out a few dollars and Ballou put him in the Dumpster?\" \"He didn\u0027t know who\u0027d killed Rooney, but I gather there had been other incidents as well, and the implication was somebody was trying to muscle in on him. His take on Jim\u0027s shooting was that I\u0027d been the target, and it was because I was a friend of his.\" \"That\u0027s what he told you.\" \"Yes.\" \"And I don\u0027t suppose he mentioned who was putting the screws to him.\" \"He said he didn\u0027t know.\" \"Like getting roses from a secret admirer? Except instead of roses it\u0027s death threats?\" \"Maybe he knew and didn\u0027t say.\" \"Yeah, and maybe he said and it\u0027s you that doesn\u0027t want to say. And then what happened?\" \"What happened?\" \"Yeah. What did you do next?\" \"I went home. I can\u0027t say I took it all that seriously. Why should a friendship make me the target of a presumably professional hit?\" I shrugged. \"I couldn\u0027t sleep. I was up late, drinking coffee in the kitchen and grieving for my friend.\" \"That\u0027s your friend Jimmy.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/everybody-dies-matthew-scudder-14/page-21.html","bookId":2332,"book":{"id":2332,"title":"Everybody Dies (Matthew Scudder #14)","description":"Storyline: Everybody Dies (Matthew Scudder #14) Matt Scudder is finally leading a comfortable life.
