To wonder.\" He opened desk drawers until he found the one with the bottle of Jameson in it. He cracked the seal and drank from the bottle. He said, \"Was she the one, then?\"\\n\\n \"The one?\"\\n\\n \"Your bit on the side.\"\\n\\n \"I guess that\u0027s as good a phrase as any. We stopped seeing each other awhile ago.\"\\n\\n \"Did you love her?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"Ah.\"\\n\\n \"I cared for her, though.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s rare enough,\" he said, and took another drink. \"I never loved anyone. Aside from my mother and my brothers, but that\u0027s a different matter, isn\u0027t it?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"Of women, I loved none and cared for few.\"\\n\\n \"I love Elaine,\" I said. \"I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve ever loved anyone else.\"\\n\\n \"You were married before.\"\\n\\n \"A long time ago.\"\\n\\n \"Did you love her?\"\\n\\n \"There was a time when I thought I did.\"\\n\\n \"Ah. What was this one\u0027s name?\"\\n\\n \"Lisa.\"\\n\\n \"She was a fine-looking woman.\"\\n\\n My mind filled with a picture of her as I saw her last, her skull shattered. I blinked it away and saw her in her apartment, wearing jeans and a sweater, standing in front of a window with a view of the setting sun. That was better.\\n\\n \"Yes,\" I said. \"She was.\"\\n\\n \"It was sudden, you know. I doubt she ever knew what hit her.\"\\n\\n \"But she\u0027s gone.\"\\n\\n \"That she is,\" he said.\\n\\n He had the old leather satchel on top of the desk and was poking around in it. \"Cash from the safe,\" he said. \"Some papers. All the guns I could grab up. The police can get a court order and torch the safe, or they\u0027ll do it without a court order. What they can\u0027t use as evidence against me they\u0027ll shove in their pockets. So I didn\u0027t want to leave them too much.\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"And anything they left would be useless to me, as I couldn\u0027t go back for it. They\u0027ll have it sealed off, once they\u0027ve finished with their photographs and measurements, all the scientific things they do. You\u0027d know more about that than I.\"\\n\\n \"The crime scene routine\u0027s changed since my day,\" I said. \"It seems to me they shoot a lot of videotape these days. And they keep getting more scientific.\"\\n\\n \"Though what\u0027s the need for science in this? One man sprays a room with. bullets and another hurls a bomb. I wonder have they finished carrying out the dead yet. I wonder how many dead there were, and others dying.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll hear it on the news.\"\\n\\n \"Too many, whatever the number. A whole row drinking their pints at the bar, and a stream of bullets to knock them off their stools. Not Eamonn Dougherty, though. Never a scratch on him. Did I not once tell you he\u0027d outlive us all?\"\\n\\n \"I believe you did.\"\\n\\n \"The murderous wee bastard. I wonder how old he is. Jesus, he was in Tom Barry\u0027s flying column. He has to be ninety, and he could be ninety-five. A long life to live when you\u0027ve all that blood on your hands. Or do you suppose the blood washes off after so many years?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know.\"\\n\\n \"I wonder,\" he said, and looked down at his own hands. \"You saw the gunman. Vietnamese, Andy thought. Or Thai, or God knows what else. Did you get a look at the one that threw the bomb?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"He got away, and I scarcely saw him myself. There was his big face, looming over the other\u0027s shoulder, and then he threw the bomb and after that I never saw him again. It seems to me he was a very pale washed-out sort of white.\"\\n\\n \"And partnered with an Asian.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s the entire United fucking Nations arrayed against me,\" he said. \"It\u0027s no more than luck they weren\u0027t trying to kill me.\"\\n\\n \"You mean all that was just to get your attention?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, they came to do murder, and it was murder they did. But I\u0027d say the man who sent them never expected to find me there, or yourself either. He sent those two to destroy the place and kill as many people as they could.\" He hefted the weapon he\u0027d taken from the dead Asian. \"If I hadn\u0027t shot the fucker,\" he said, \"he\u0027d have gone on firing until he killed everyone in the room.\"\\n\\n And if he hadn\u0027t been quick as a cat, knocking me down even as he drew the gun…\\n\\n \"A big moon face pale as death. Does that sound like anyone you know?\"\\n\\n \"A cop said the moon\u0027s full tonight.\"\\n\\n \"Then maybe that was himself. The man in the moon, come down to pay his respects. What about the two who waylaid you the other night?\"\\n\\n I described them as well as I could and he just shook his head. They could be anybody, he said. Anybody at all.\\n\\n \"And it was a black man did the shooting at the Chinese restaurant. It makes a man long for the old days, when the only people I had to worry about were the Eyetalians. And they may have been bad bastards but you could reason with them. Now it\u0027s the Rainbow Coalition, with all the races of man uniting against me. What\u0027s next, do you suppose? Cats and dogs?\"\\n\\n \"Are you safe here, Mick?\"\\n\\n \"Safe enough, for as long as I\u0027ll be here. I didn\u0027t want to go to any of my apartments. There\u0027s people who know about them. Only a few people, and they\u0027re people I trust, but how do I know who\u0027s to be trusted? Andy Buckley\u0027s almost a son to me, but who\u0027s to say what he\u0027ll do if some bastard puts a gun to his head?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s why you wouldn\u0027t let him drop us off.\"\\n\\n \"No, I wanted a car handy, and a less noticeable car than the Cadillac. But he\u0027s no need to know where I am. He can\u0027t reveal what\u0027s been kept from him.\"\\n\\n \"Couldn\u0027t you go to the farm?\"\\n\\n He shook his head. \"There\u0027s altogether too many know of the farm. And it\u0027s too far away from everything.\" He took a drink. \"If I wanted to be away from it all,\" he said, \"I could stay with the brothers.\"\\n\\n That puzzled me for a moment. Then I said, \"Oh. The monastery?\"\\n\\n \"The Thessalonians, of course. What were you thinking?\"\\n\\n \"You said the brothers, and we were talking about the shooter being black and the Rainbow Coalition, and…\"\\n\\n \"Ah, that\u0027s rich,\" he said. \"No, it\u0027s the brothers on Staten Island, not the brothers on Lenox Avenue.\" He looked at his hands again. \"I\u0027m a terrible Catholic,\" he said. \"Ages since my last confession, and a soul well blackened with sins. But I could go there, to the brothers, and they\u0027d take me in and ask me no questions. Whoever he is, he\u0027d never think to hunt me there. He\u0027d not be sending his black and brown shooters, or his pale white bomb throwers, either.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe that\u0027s not a bad idea, Mick.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s no idea at all,\" he said, \"because I can\u0027t do it.\"\\n\\n \"Why not? Suppose you just walk away from it all.\"\\n\\n He shook his head. \"There\u0027s nothing to walk away from. I don\u0027t know who he is or what he wants, the man who\u0027s set all this in motion, but it can\u0027t be anything I have. Am I a crime boss with a great territory? I\u0027m nothing of the sort. I own a few pieces of property, I have some business interests, but that\u0027s not what he wants. Don\u0027t you see? It\u0027s personal with him. He wants to destroy me.\" He uncapped the bottle, took a drink. \"And all I can do,\" he said, \"is try to get him first.\"\\n\\n \"Before he gets you.\"\\n\\n \"Is there another way? You\u0027re the policeman.\"\\n\\n \"Years ago.\"\\n\\n \"But you can still think like one. Give me a policeman\u0027s advice. Shall I go swear out a complaint? Against person or persons unknown?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"Or ask for police protection? They couldn\u0027t protect me if they wanted to, and whyever should they want to? Haven\u0027t I lived my whole life on the other side of the law? And now it\u0027s kill or be killed, and how can I be hoisting a white flag and asking them to change the rules?\"\\n\\n A door at the left rear corner of the basement opened onto a flight of steps leading up to the air shaft. Mick unbolted the door and asked me again if I didn\u0027t want to catch a few hours\u0027 sleep before I went home. I could have the couch, he said. He was drinking, he\u0027d just sit in the chair and sip whiskey until he dozed off.\\n\\n I told him I didn\u0027t want Elaine to wake up before I got home. She\u0027d turn on the news and hear what had happened at Grogan\u0027s.\\n\\n \"\u0027Twill be everyone\u0027s lead story,\" he said. \"I\u0027d put on the radio to learn the number of dead, but I\u0027ll know soon enough.\" He gripped my shoulder. \"Go on home. And keep your eyes open, will you?\"\\n\\n \"I will.\"\\n\\n \"And pack your bags and take herself off to Ireland or Italy or wherever she wants to go. Just so you get the hell away from here. Will you do that?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll let you know.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s what I want to hear from you, that you\u0027re at the airport waiting for your flight to board.\"\\n\\n \"How will I call you? What\u0027s the phone number here?\"\\n\\n \"Wait a minute,\" he said, and scribbled on a piece of paper, straightened up and handed it to me. \"The cellular phone. I never give out the number because I don\u0027t want a fucking telephone ringing in my pocket. I just bought the creature because you can never find a pay phone that works, or if you do you\u0027ve no quarters for it. I don\u0027t know how much time I\u0027ll spend here, and I don\u0027t want to answer the store phone anyway, with people calling to inquire about doorknobs and strap hinges. Call me from the airport, eh? Will you do that?\"\\n\\n He didn\u0027t wait for an answer, just gave me a pat on the back and a shove out the door. I headed up the dark stairs and heard the door close, heard the lock turn.\\n\\n \"He saved my life,\" I said. \"No question. The one guy was spraying the room with bullets, trying to kill everything with a pulse. There was a couple two tables away having a low-voltage lovers\u0027 quarrel. Killed, both of them. Same thing would have happened to me if I\u0027d stayed in my chair.\"\\n\\n \"But not if you\u0027d stayed in bed.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027d have been fine,\" I said. \"Until the next time I walked out the door.\"\\n\\n She\u0027d been sleeping when I got home, but not deeply. The sound of my key in the lock was enough to wake her. She got up, rubbing sleep out of her eyes, put on a robe and followed me into the kitchen. I made the coffee for a change, and while it dripped through I told her everything that had happened.\\n\\n She said, \"Bombs and bullets. I\u0027d say it sounds like The Godfather, Part Four, except it doesn\u0027t, not really. It sounds like a war.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s what it feels like.\"\\n\\n \"Welcome to Sarajevo. Or isn\u0027t there a bar in the East Village called Downtown Beirut?\"\\n\\n \"On Second Avenue, if it\u0027s still in business.\"\\n\\n \"Two people go out for a beer so they can talk about their relationship, and the next thing you know they\u0027re wearing toe tags. Caught in the crossfire. Was there any crossfire?\"\\n\\n \"Not from me. Mick emptied his gun at him. He was the one who shot the shooter. My gun never made it out of the holster, and Tom and Andy were all the way in the back, so I don\u0027t think anybody else on our side got any shots off.\"\\n\\n \"\u0027Our side.\u0027\" She sipped her coffee and made a face. It was too strong. When I make the coffee it always comes out too strong.\\n\\n She said, \"He was saving his own life, you know.\"\\n\\n \"He covered me with his body. Flopped on top of me, deliberately shielded me.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/everybody-dies-matthew-scudder-14/page-18.html","bookId":2332,"book":{"id":2332,"title":"Everybody Dies (Matthew Scudder #14)","description":"Storyline: Everybody Dies (Matthew Scudder #14) \\n Matt Scudder is finally leading a comfortable life.
