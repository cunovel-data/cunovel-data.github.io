The crime rate\u0027s down and the stock market\u0027s up. Gentrification\u0027s prettying-up the old neighborhood. The New York streets don\u0027t look so mean anymore. Then all hell breaks loose. Scudder quickly discovers the spruced-up sidewalks are as mean as ever, dark and gritty and stained with blood. He\u0027s living in a world where the past is a minefield, the present is a war zone, and the future\u0027s an open question. It\u0027s a world where nothing is certain and nobody\u0027s safe, a random universe where no one\u0027s survival can be taken for granted. Not even his own. A world where everybody dies.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/everybody-dies-matthew-scudder-14.jpg","author":"Lawrence Block","type":"Mystery","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":45,"category":{"id":19,"name":"Mystery","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
