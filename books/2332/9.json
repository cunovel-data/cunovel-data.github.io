{"id":64396,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"My stomach was predictably sore from the blow I\u0027d taken, and there was some equally predictable discoloration. It would be worse tomorrow, in all likelihood, and then it would start getting better.\\n\\n Both my hands were a little stiff and sore, too, from the right that had glanced off the side of his head and the left that had gone where it was supposed to. I had other muscular aches here and there, in the arms and shoulders, in the calf of one leg, and in my upper back. I\u0027d used various muscles in ways I didn\u0027t often use them, and there was a price to pay. There always is.\\n\\n I took a couple of aspirin and dialed a phone number I didn\u0027t have to look up. \"I almost called you last night,\" I told Jim Faber, after I\u0027d filled him in on what he\u0027d missed after we\u0027d parted company.\\n\\n \"You could have.\"\\n\\n \"I thought about it. But \u0027it was pretty late. If Elaine hadn\u0027t been here I wouldn\u0027t have hesitated, it was no time for me to be alone, but she was here and I was all right.\"\\n\\n \"And you don\u0027t keep booze around the house.\"\\n\\n \"No, and I didn\u0027t want a drink.\"\\n\\n \"Still, going straight to a ginmill right after a street fightâ€¦\"\\n\\n \"I paused at the threshold,\" I said, \"and decided I was all right. I had a message to deliver, and I delivered it, and then I got the hell out of there and came home.\"\\n\\n \"How do you feel now?\"\\n\\n \"Old.\"\\n\\n \"Really? I\u0027d think you\u0027d be feeling like a young lion. How old were the guys you beat up?\"\\n\\n \"I wouldn\u0027t say I beat them up. I surprised them and I lucked out. How old? I don\u0027t know. Say thirty-five.\"\\n\\n \"Kids.\"\\n\\n \"Not exactly.\"\\n\\n \"Still, that\u0027s got to feel good, Matt. Two young fellows and you knock them on their asses? Even if luck had a little to do with it- \"\\n\\n \"More than a little.\"\\n\\n \"- it still goes in the books as a win.\"\\n\\n We talked some more, and he steered the conversation to our Sunday dinner date, suggesting we meet at the Chinese vegetarian place across from the Coliseum. \"Months since we ate there,\" he said, \"and I\u0027m in the mood for some of that famous ersatz eel of theirs.\"\\n\\n \"Out of business,\" I said.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re kidding. Since when?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know, but I saw the sign in their window sometime early last week. \u0027Restaurant Close. Go Somewhere Else. Thanks You.\u0027 Not quite the way they\u0027d put it in the English as a Second Language class, but the message was crystal clear.\"\\n\\n \"Elaine must be distraught.\"\\n\\n \"Try inconsolable. We found a vegetarian place in Chinatown, there are a few of them down there now, but the one on Fifty-eighth was a favorite of hers and it was right around the corner. It\u0027s going to leave a hole in her life.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027ll leave a small one in mine. Where else am I gonna find eel made from soybeans? I don\u0027t care for real eel, only the phony kind.\"\\n\\n \"You want to try the place in Chinatown?\"\\n\\n \"Well, I\u0027d like to have that eel dish one more time before I die, but that\u0027s a long way to go for it.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not even sure they\u0027ve got eel on the menu. The joint on Fifty-eighth\u0027s the only place I\u0027ve ever seen it.\"\\n\\n \"In other words we could drag our asses all the way downtown and I\u0027d wind up having abalone made out of gluten?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a risk you\u0027d be running.\"\\n\\n \"Or lamb chops made out of library paste. Eel aside, I\u0027d just as soon stick to real food, so let\u0027s forget about Chinatown. God knows there are enough Chinese places in the neighborhood.\"\\n\\n \"Pick one.\"\\n\\n \"Hmmm,\" he said. \"Where haven\u0027t we been in a while? How about the little place on Eighth and Fifty-third? You know the one I\u0027m thinking of? The northeast corner, except it\u0027s not right at the corner, it\u0027s one or two doors up the avenue.\"\\n\\n \"I know the one you mean. The Something Panda. I want to say Golden, but that\u0027s not right.\"\\n\\n \"Pandas are generally black and white.\"\\n\\n \"Thanks. You\u0027re right, though, we haven\u0027t been there in ages. And as I recall it was pretty good.\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027re all pretty good. Six-thirty?\"\\n\\n \"Perfect.\"\\n\\n \"And can I trust you to stay out of fistfights between now and then? And ginmills?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a deal,\" I said.\\n\\n There\u0027s a gun shop on Centre Market Place, around the block from the old Centre Street police headquarters. They\u0027ve been there forever, and they carry a wide range of weapons, along with a full stock of police gear and training manuals. I went there to buy a shoulder holster, and as an afterthought I picked up a box of shells, the same hollow-point ammunition as the five in the Smith. Anybody can buy a holster, but I had to show a permit to buy the shells. I\u0027d brought mine, and showed it, and signed the register.\\n\\n They had Kevlar vests, too, but I already owned one. In fact I was wearing it, I\u0027d put it on before I left the house.\\n\\n It was a warm day to be wearing a bulletproof vest, with the humidity a few percentage points beyond the comfort range. I didn\u0027t need a jacket on a day like that, but I was wearing my navy blazer. I had the little Smith jammed under my belt, and I needed the jacket to keep it from showing, even as I\u0027d need it to conceal the shoulder holster.\\n\\n They gave me the shells and the holster in a paper bag, and I walked around carrying it, looking for a place to have lunch. I passed up a slew of Asian restaurants and wound up on Mulberry Street, on the two-block stretch that\u0027s about all that\u0027s left of Little Italy. I sat in the rear garden at Luna and ordered a plate of linguini with red clam sauce. While they were fixing it I locked myself in the men\u0027s room. I shucked my jacket and put on the holster, adjusted the straps, then drew the gun from my waistband and tucked it in place. I checked the mirror, and it seemed to me that the bulge of the holster would be visible clear across the room. It was more comfortable, though, than walking around with the gun in my belt, especially with my middle as sore as it was.\\n\\n On the way back to my table I had the feeling that everybody in the restaurant, if not everyone in the neighborhood, knew I was armed.\\n\\n I ate my lunch and went home.\\n\\n When TJ called I was watching Notre Dame beat up on Miami. I\u0027d slung my blazer over the back of a chair and I was sitting around in my shirtsleeves, with the holster in place and the gun in it. I put on the blazer and went across the street to the Morning Star.\\n\\n We usually sat at one of the window tables, and he was there when I arrived, sipping orange juice through a straw. I moved us to a table near the kitchen, far away from the windows, and sat where I could keep an eye on the entrance.\\n\\n TJ noted all this without comment. After I\u0027d ordered coffee he said, \"Heard all about you. How you the baddest dude in the \u0027hood, kickin\u0027 ass and takin\u0027 names.\"\\n\\n \"At my age,\" I said, \"it\u0027s more a matter of kicking ass and forgetting names. What did you hear and where did you hear it?\"\\n\\n \"Already said what I heard, and where you think I heard it? I was over at Elaine\u0027s shop. Oh, did I hear it on the street? No, but if you tryin\u0027 to build yourself a rep, I be happy to spread the word.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t do me any favors.\"\\n\\n \"You all dressed for success. Where we goin\u0027, Owen?\"\\n\\n \"Nowhere that I know of.\"\\n\\n \"Elaine says you be all done investigatin\u0027 what went down in Jersey, but I was thinkin\u0027 maybe you just told her that to put her at ease.\"\\n\\n \"I wouldn\u0027t do that. I was done anyway, before the incident last night, and all it did was confirm what you and I already determined.\"\\n\\n \"We ain\u0027t workin\u0027, must be you dressed up just to come here for coffee.\" He cocked his head, eyed the bulge on the left side of my chest. \"That what I think it is?\"\\n\\n \"How would I know?\"\\n\\n \"Cause how you know what I thinkin\u0027? \u0027Cept you do know, an\u0027 I know, too, \u0027cause she already said how you takin\u0027 precautions. That the piece you took off of the dude?\"\\n\\n \"The very same. It\u0027s not hard to spot, is it?\"\\n\\n \"Not when you lookin\u0027 for it, but it ain\u0027t like you wearin\u0027 a sign. You was to go around like that all the time, you\u0027d want to get your jacket tailored so it don\u0027t bulge.\"\\n\\n \"I used to carry night and day,\" I said. \"On duty or off. There was a departmental regulation that said you had to. I wonder if it\u0027s still on the books. With all the drunken off-duty cops who\u0027ve shot themselves and each other over the years, the brass might have decided to rethink that particular rule.\"\\n\\n \"Cops\u0027d carry anyway, wouldn\u0027t they? Reg or no reg?\"\\n\\n \"Probably. I lived out on Long Island for years, and the regulation was only in force within the five boroughs, but I carried all the time. Of course there was another regulation requiring a New York City police officer to reside within the five boroughs, but it was never hard to find a way around that one.\"\\n\\n He sucked up the last of the orange juice and the straw made a gurgling noise. He said, \"Don\u0027t know who thought up orange juice, but the man was a genius. Tastes so good it\u0027s near impossible to believe it\u0027s good for you. But it is. Unless they lyin\u0027, Brian?\"\\n\\n \"As far as I know, they\u0027re telling the truth.\"\\n\\n \"Restores my faith,\" he said. \"\u0027Member the time I bought a gun on the street for you? Gave it to you in a Kangaroo, same as the seller gave it to me.\"\\n\\n \"So you did. It was a blue one.\"\\n\\n \"Blue, right. Sort of a lame color, if I remember right.\"\\n\\n \"If you say so.\"\\n\\n \"You still got it?\"\\n\\n I\u0027d obtained the gun for a friend who was dying of pancreatic cancer. She wanted a quick way out if it got too bad to be borne. It got very bad indeed before it finally killed her, but she\u0027d somehow been able to live with it until she died of it, and she\u0027d never had to use the gun.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t know what became of the gun. I suppose it sat on a shelf in her closet, snug in the blue Kangaroo fanny pack in which I\u0027d delivered it. I suppose somebody found it when they went through her effects, and I had not the slightest idea what might have become of it since.\\n\\n \"They ain\u0027t hard to find,\" he went on. \"All those Korean dudes, got them little stores, tables out front full of sunglasses and baseball caps? They all got Kangaroos. Set you back ten, fifteen dollars, few dollars more if you go for all leather. How much you have to pay for that shoulder rig?\"\\n\\n \"More than ten or fifteen dollars.\"\\n\\n \"Kangaroo wouldn\u0027t spoil the line of your jacket. Wouldn\u0027t need to be wearin\u0027 a jacket, far as that goes.\"\\n\\n \"I probably won\u0027t need the gun at all,\" I said. \"But if I do I won\u0027t want to screw around with a zipper.\"\\n\\n \"You sayin\u0027 that\u0027s not how Quick Draw McGraw does it.\"\\n\\n \"Right.\"\\n\\n \"What a lot of the dudes do is leave the zipper open. That looks sort of cool anyway.\"\\n\\n \"Like wearing sneakers with the laces untied.\"\\n\\n \"Sort of like that, \u0027cept you ain\u0027t likely to trip over your Kangaroos. Things turn tense, you just reach in your hand and there you are.\" He rolled his eyes. \"But I be wastin\u0027 my breath, Beth, on account of you ain\u0027t about to get no Kangaroo, are you?\"\\n\\n \"I guess not,\" I said. \"I guess I\u0027m just not a Kangaroo kind of guy.\"\\n\\n I went back and watched some more football, changing channels whenever they went to a commercial and not really keeping track of any of the games. A little before six I turned off the TV and walked down to Elaine\u0027s shop. elaine mardell, the sign above the window says, and the shop within is a good reflection of the proprietor- folk art and antiques, paintings she\u0027s salvaged from thrift shops and rummage sales, and the oils and drawings of a few contemporary artists she\u0027s discovered. She has an artist\u0027s eye, and spotted the gun instantly. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/everybody-dies-matthew-scudder-14/page-9.html","bookId":2332,"book":{"id":2332,"title":"Everybody Dies (Matthew Scudder #14)","description":"Storyline: Everybody Dies (Matthew Scudder #14) \\n Matt Scudder is finally leading a comfortable life.
