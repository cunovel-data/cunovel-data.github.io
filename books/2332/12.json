{"id":64399,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"He\u0027d never let me get away with crap like that. You must have one hell of an ego, he told me more than once, to be that hard on yourself. Where do you get off setting yourself such impossibly high standards? Who do you think you are, anyway? The piece of shit the world revolves around? I said, You mean I\u0027m not? You\u0027re just a man, he said. You\u0027re just another alcoholic. That\u0027s all? That\u0027s enough, he said. If only the past were subject to change. When TJ has second thoughts at the computer, he can press certain keys and undo the previous action. But, as a pinball addict told me years ago, the trouble with life is there\u0027s no reset button. What\u0027s done can never be undone. It\u0027s set in concrete, carved in stone. Omar Khayyam wrote it ages ago, and put it so well that even I can remember the lines: The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ, Moves on, nor all your Piety nor Wit Shall lure it back to cancel half a Line, Nor all your Tears wash out a Word of it. If only that were not so. If only… I was questioned at length at the crime scene, first by the uniforms who responded to the 911 call, then by somebody in plainclothes. It\u0027s impossible to remember the questions and answers because I was only dimly aware of the procedure while it was going on. A portion of my mind was struggling to pay attention, taking in what was being said by others within earshot, monitoring the questions I was asked and the answers I gave. The rest of me was somewhere else, wandering aimlessly through corridors of the past, sending out forays into an alternate future. An if-only future, a future in which, because I\u0027d done something differently, Jim was still alive. When I was eleven or twelve I got hit in the forehead with a baseball and walked around all day with a concussion. This was like that. As if I\u0027d been swathed in cotton wool, enveloped in fog. I wasn\u0027t really taking anything in, and it would all imprint on my memory like dream time, soft and hazy and out of focus, with pieces missing. It was a quarter to ten when the fog cleared, or lifted, or whatever it does. I noted the time on the wall clock in the squad room upstairs at Midtown North, where I dimly recall being taken in the back of a blue and white police cruiser. We could have walked; the station house was on Fifty-fourth west of Eighth, literally a stone\u0027s throw from the Lucky Panda. I suppose the whole precinct house knew the restaurant. Cops have a legendary appetite for doughnuts, but they also put away a lot of Chinese food, and some of Midtown North\u0027s Finest were likely to be at least occasional patrons of the Lucky Panda. That gave me one more entry in the If-Only sweepstakes. Why couldn\u0027t there have been a couple of uniforms at a front table? The shooter would have taken one look and gone home. A quarter to ten. I hadn\u0027t even noticed the time until now. I\u0027d met Jim around six-thirty. We talked for a minute or two. I went to the lavatory, I used the lavatory, I came rushing out of the lavatory… Three hours gone since then, and gone in no time at all. I must have spent a lot of it sitting or standing around, waiting for something to happen, waiting for somebody to tell me what to do. I must have been in a very tractable state. Unaware as I was of the passage of time, I hadn\u0027t grown bored or impatient. \"Matt? Here, whyntcha have a seat? We\u0027ll go over this one more time and then you can go home and get some rest.\" \"Sure,\" I said. This detective\u0027s name was George Wister. He was lean and angular, with a sharp nose and chin and a carefully trimmed little mustache. His beard was dark and heavy, and I suppose he\u0027d shaved when he got up that morning but he needed to shave again and knew it. He had a habit of touching his cheek or chin, running a finger against the grain of his whiskers, as if to check just how urgent was his need for a shave. He was around forty, 5\u002710\", dark brown hair, deep-set dark brown eyes. I registered all this and wondered why. Nobody would be asking me to describe the investigating officer. What they\u0027d have liked from me was a description of the killer, and I couldn\u0027t help them with that. \"I\u0027m sorry to have kept you so long,\" Wister was saying. \"But you know how these things work. You were on the job yourself.\" \"Years ago.\" \"And it seems to me I\u0027ve seen you around the house. You\u0027re tight with Joe Durkin, aren\u0027t you?\" \"We\u0027ve known each other awhile.\" \"And now you\u0027re working private.\" I dug out my wallet and started to show him my license. \"No, that\u0027s all right,\" he said. \"You showed me before.\" \"It\u0027s hard to keep it straight. What I showed and who I showed it to.\" \"Yeah, and everybody wants to go over the same ground, and the whole experience takes it out of you to begin with. You must be dead on your feet.\" Was I? I didn\u0027t even know. \"And anxious to get home.\" He touched his chin, his cheek. \"Deceased is James Martin Faber,\" he read off a clipboard, and went on to read Jim\u0027s address and the name and address of his place of business, looking at me each time for confirmation. I said, \"His wife is- \" \"Mrs. Beverly Faber, same address. She\u0027s being notified, in fact they\u0027ve probably been over to see her by now. Get her to make a formal ID.\" \"I\u0027ll have to see her myself.\" \"You want to get some rest first, Matt. You\u0027re in shock yourself right now.\" I could have told him it was wearing off. I was myself again, whatever that amounted to. But all I did was nod. \"Faber was a friend of yours.\" \"My sponsor.\" The word puzzled him, and I was sorry I\u0027d used it because now I had to explain it. Not that there was any reason not to explain. There\u0027s a tradition against breaking the anonymity of another AA member, but it\u0027s a courtesy extended only to the living. \"My AA sponsor,\" I said. \"That\u0027d be Alcoholics Anonymous?\" \"That\u0027s right.\" \"I thought anybody could join. I didn\u0027t know you had to be sponsored.\" \"You don\u0027t,\" I said. \"A sponsor\u0027s something you get after you\u0027ve joined, more a combination friend and adviser. Sort of like a rabbi on the job.\" \"A more experienced guy? Pulls strings for you, helps you keep your nose clean?\" \"It\u0027s a little different,\" I said, \"in that there are no promotions in AA, and the only way you can get in trouble is by picking up a drink. A sponsor is someone you can talk to, someone who\u0027ll help you stay sober.\" \"Not a problem I\u0027ve got,\" he said, \"but a lot of cops do, and no wonder. The stress you got to deal with day in and day out.\" Every job\u0027s stressful when you need a drink. \"So the two of you met for dinner. You have something special on your mind, something you needed to talk about?\" \"No.\" \"You\u0027re married, he\u0027s married, but the two of you left your wives home on a Sunday night and went out for Chinese.\" \"Every Sunday night,\" I said. \"That so?\" \"With rare exceptions, yes.\" \"So it was a regular thing. Is that standard procedure in AA?\" \"Nothing\u0027s standard in AA,\" I said, \"except not drinking, and even that\u0027s not as standard as you might think. Our Sunday dinners started as part of the sponsorial relationship, a way to get to know each other. Over the years it became just a part of our friendship.\" \"\u0027Over the years.\u0027 He was your sponsor for a long time?\" \"Sixteen years.\" \"You\u0027re kidding. Sixteen years? And you haven\u0027t had a drink in all that time?\" \"Not so far.\" \"And you still go to the meetings?\" \"I do.\" \"What about him?\" \"He did.\" \"Meaning he stopped?\" I was trying to figure out how I was supposed to answer that when he got the point and his face flushed. \"Sorry,\" he said. \"Been a long day.\" He looked down at the clipboard. \"Every Sunday night. Always the same restaurant?\" \"Always Chinese,\" I said. \"Different restaurants.\" \"Why Chinese? Any particular reason?\" \"Just a habit we got into.\" \"Well, you could pick a new Chinese restaurant every week and it\u0027d be awhile before you ran out. What I\u0027m getting at, who knew the two of you were going to be there tonight?\" \"Nobody.\" \"I take it you didn\u0027t make a reservation.\" \"At the Lucky Panda?\" \"Yeah, I wonder did anybody ever make a reservation there. At lunch, maybe, because they\u0027ll fill up noontime during the week, but on nights and weekends you can shoot deer in there.\" \"Or people,\" I said. He looked at me, unsure how to respond. He drew a breath and asked me who picked the restaurant. \"I\u0027m not sure,\" I said. \"Let me think. He\u0027d suggested a place on Fifty-eighth, but they\u0027d gone out of business. Then I suggested Chinatown and he said that was too much trouble, and I think he was the one who thought of the Lucky Panda.\" \"And when was this?\" \"Yesterday, it must have been. We talked on the phone.\" \"And picked the time and the place to meet.\" He wrote something down. \"And the last time you actually saw him was…\" \"Friday night at the meeting.\" \"That\u0027d be an AA meeting, right? And you spoke on the phone yesterday and met for dinner tonight as arranged.\" \"That\u0027s right.\" \"Did you mention to anybody where you\u0027d be having dinner?\" \"I may have said something to my wife. I don\u0027t even know.\" \"But nobody else.\" \"No.\" \"And he\u0027d have told his wife?\" \"Possibly. He\u0027d probably have told her he was having dinner with me, but I don\u0027t know that he\u0027d have bothered telling her where.\" \"You know his wife?\" \"To say hello to. I doubt I\u0027ve seen her twenty times in sixteen years.\" \"You didn\u0027t get along?\" \"He and I were friends, that\u0027s all. Elaine and I had dinner with Jim and Beverly a couple of times, but that\u0027s literally all it was. Two or three times.\" \"Elaine being your wife.\" \"Right.\" \"How were they getting along?\" \"Jim and his wife?\" \"Uh-huh. He ever talk about that?\" \"Not lately.\" \"So as far as you know…\" \"As far as I know, they were getting along fine.\" \"He\u0027d have said if they weren\u0027t?\" \"I think so.\" \"Who can you think of that he wasn\u0027t getting along with?\" \"Jim got along with everybody,\" I said. \"He was a very easygoing guy.\" \"Didn\u0027t have an enemy in the world.\" He sounded skeptical, the way cops do. \"If he did,\" I said, \"I didn\u0027t know about it.\" \"How about his business?\" \"His business?\" \"Uh-huh. He was a printer, right? Had a printshop here in the neighborhood?\" I got out one of my business cards. \"He printed these for me,\" I said. He ran his thumb across the raised lettering. Maybe he wanted to see if it needed a shave. \"Nice work,\" he said. \"Okay if I keep this?\" \"Sure.\" \"Know anything about his business?\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/everybody-dies-matthew-scudder-14/page-12.html","bookId":2332,"book":{"id":2332,"title":"Everybody Dies (Matthew Scudder #14)","description":"Storyline: Everybody Dies (Matthew Scudder #14) Matt Scudder is finally leading a comfortable life.
