I said, \"He\u0027s a friend in need, so I should drop him.\" \"Like a hot rock. What he is is a friend in deep shit, and he earned every ounce of it, and you\u0027ll go down with him if you stand too close. Jesus Christ, Matt, are you too thick to get that I\u0027m trying to do you a favor? Am I wasting my breath here or what?\" I went home, entering as I\u0027d left, via the service entrance. There were two new messages on the machine. One was from Ray Gruliow, saying that he\u0027d spoken to Mark Rosenstein, and I was now officially engaged to investigate in the interests of Rosenstein\u0027s client, one Michael Francis Ballou. The other was from Denis Hamill at the Daily News, hoping I could say something quotable for a column he was doing on the death of a great saloon. I called him back and told him Grogan\u0027s wasn\u0027t dead, it was only sleeping. I called Ray Galindez at home after trying and failing to reach him at work. His wife, Bitsy, answered, and asked after Elaine, and brought me up to date on their kids. Then she said, \"I suppose you want to talk to the boss,\" and I held until Ray picked up. \"I need your professional services,\" I said, \"but it has to be off the record.\" \"No problem. Who\u0027ll I be working with?\" \"Just me. I saw a guy the other day, and I wish I had a picture of him.\" \"That\u0027ll be great,\" he said. \"You\u0027re easy to work with. Some people are just too eager to please you. \u0027Yeah, that\u0027s good, that looks like him\u0027- except it doesn\u0027t, but they don\u0027t want to hurt your feelings. When do you want to do this? I\u0027d say tonight, but we got this evening planned with Bitsy\u0027s sister and her dork of a husband. Do me a favor and tell me it\u0027s so urgent I\u0027ve got to cancel.\" \"It\u0027s not that urgent.\" \"I\u0027m sorry to hear it. In that case, is tomorrow okay? These days they\u0027ve got me in Bushwick.\" \"I know, I tried you there first.\" \"Yeah, ordinarily I\u0027d be working but I took a personal day. My older boy had a soccer game and I wanted to be there. I\u0027ll tell you, watching him play, I think he\u0027ll have to be an artist like his old man.\" \"There\u0027s worse things.\" \"I guess. You want me to come by your place tomorrow? I\u0027m off at four and the station house is right next to the subway. I could be there easy by five.\" \"Maybe it would be better if I came to you.\" \"You sure? Because that\u0027s great as far as I\u0027m concerned. Saves me a train ride. You want to come by the job? I got more time on my hands there than I know what to do with.\" \"It might be a little too public.\" \"Right, you wanted this off the record. So maybe that\u0027s not such a hot idea. That was quite a thing happened in your part of town last night.\" \"Terrible,\" I agreed. \"Look, would it be an intrusion if I came to your house? You\u0027re off at four, so say five o\u0027clock? Would that be all right?\" \"That\u0027d be fine. I know Bitsy\u0027d love to see you. In fact why don\u0027t you bring Elaine with you? I\u0027ve got some new work I\u0027ve been trying to get up the nerve to bring in and show to her. Come around five and you\u0027ll stay and have dinner with us.\" \"I think, it\u0027ll just be me,\" I said, \"and I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll have time for dinner.\" I tried TJ across the street, and when he didn\u0027t answer I called his beeper number. I had the TV on when he called back, and I muted it while the machine picked up and told him to leave his message at the tone. \"I know you there,\" he said, \"on account of you just beeped me, so- \" \"So you must be a detective,\" I said, \"to figure that out. Where are you?\" \"You a detective too. Can\u0027t you tell?\" He must have held the phone toward the crowd, because the background noise picked up in volume. \"O\u0027Hare Airport,\" I said. \"Morning Star restaurant.\" \"Well, I was close.\" \"An\u0027 I was slow callin\u0027 back, \u0027count of I had to wait on a lady to get off the phone. She had me goin\u0027 for a minute. What she did, she put in her quarter and dialed her number and then she just didn\u0027t say anything. Just stood there with the phone to her ear. I wanted to tell her, like, if they ain\u0027t answered by now ain\u0027t nobody home. How many times you gonna let it ring?\" \"She was listening to her messages.\" \"Yeah, well, I doped that out, but it took me a minute. What I been doin\u0027, I thought I might learn something on the street but they just sayin\u0027 the same shit they sayin\u0027 on the TV news. You been over to Grogan\u0027s?\" \"No.\" \"Well, don\u0027t be wastin\u0027 your time. Ain\u0027t nothin\u0027 to see. It\u0027s the same as we saw on TV, with the plywood panels up. And there\u0027s yellow crime scene tape over the plywood and on the doors, and notices posted sayin\u0027 to keep away.\" \"Which might not be a bad idea.\" \"Fine with me. Ain\u0027t nothin\u0027 there worth a second look. All I did was ask a few questions. I wore a button-down shirt and carried a clipboard, so they figured I had the right.\" \"From here on in,\" I said, \"maybe you should stick to the kind of questions you can ask electronically.\" \"Like cyber questions? There still be things got to be done the old way. You got to ask a street question to get a street answer.\" \"I asked some coffee shop questions myself,\" I said. \"The shooter at Grogan\u0027s was Vietnamese out of Born To Kill. He did time on a robbery and assault charge, and his name starts with NG.\" \"If that don\u0027t stand for No Good, it\u0027s probably Nguyen.\" \"It could be,\" I said, \"or it could be something else. I don\u0027t know if it\u0027s his first name or his last name, and I\u0027m not a hundred percent sure of the NG.\" \"Lot you don\u0027t know.\" \"Seems to be more every day.\" \"Far as first name or last, Asian names is hard to figure that way. Like the last name\u0027ll come first. Like Mao Zedong, Mao\u0027s his family name. But if you was on first-name terms with the dude, which\u0027d be hard even if he wasn\u0027t dead, you\u0027d call him Mao.\" \"That\u0027s fascinating.\" \"But it might be different for Vietnamese. And two letters is all we got of his name, first or last.\" \"A little social engineering might get you the rest of it.\" \"Might.\" \"And then if there was a way to find out where he went to prison, and who he met thereâ€¦\" \"Hard to do at your desk,\" he said. \"Prisons and government agencies and like that, they got secure systems. Hard to hack your way in, and if you do you leave a trail and they can trace it back and see who came callin\u0027. You say he was in Born To Kill?\" \"So I\u0027m told.\" \"Means I best be changin\u0027 my clothes, Mose. Blue button-down\u0027s too lame and too tame for where I be goin\u0027.\" \"Be careful.\" \"Got to,\" he said. \"What the dude said, ain\u0027t it?\" \"What dude would that be?\" \"One lived in the woods and didn\u0027t pay his taxes. Musta been before Lyme disease, when you could still get by with that shit. You know the dude I talkin\u0027 about. Said to watch out for jobs you got to dress up for.\" \"Thoreau.\" \"Yeah, that\u0027s him. I be dressin\u0027 down, not up, but it comes to the same.\" I said, \"You know, it\u0027s not video games out there. They use real bullets.\" \"You mean the players don\u0027t come back to life when you put in another quarter?\" \"And I promised Elaine I wouldn\u0027t get you killed.\" \"You did? You promised her that?\" \"Why is that so funny?\" \"Well, see,\" he said, \"she made me promise I wouldn\u0027t let nothin\u0027 happen to you. How we both supposed to keep our word?\" We ate at home. Elaine makes a mushroom-and-tofu Stroganoff that we both like, and she served it with a big green salad. After dinner I went into the other room and called Beverly Faber. I\u0027d tried her a couple of hours earlier but hung up gratefully when the line was busy. This time she answered, and I hung in there and got through the phone call. By the time I returned to the kitchen to tell Elaine I\u0027d called, I had already forgotten both sides of the conversation, what I\u0027d said and what she\u0027d said. Something about a private funeral for family members only, to be followed by a memorial service in a couple of weeks. \"He\u0027s at peace now,\" Elaine said. \"He was at peace all along,\" I said. \"He was a pretty peaceful guy. He wasn\u0027t happy all the time, for that you pretty much have to be a moron, but he was good at taking things in stride. You were right before. She\u0027s a hard woman to like, our Beverly.\" \"I think she loved him.\" \"And he loved her. It wasn\u0027t always smooth sailing for the two of them, but they made it work. I think I\u0027ll go to a meeting.\" I put on a sport jacket, a Harris tweed with elbow patches she\u0027d picked out for me. I\u0027d tried it on earlier, and it was a better fit over the holster than the blazer. \"Heavier than your windbreaker,\" she said, rubbing the sleeve, \"but it doesn\u0027t zip up. Will you be warm enough?\" \"I\u0027ll be fine.\" \"Take an umbrella. It\u0027s not raining yet but it will before the night is over.\" I opened my mouth to argue, then shut it and took the umbrella. \"I may not be back till late,\" I said. \"I won\u0027t wait up,\" she said. \"But call anytime. I\u0027ll let the machine screen the calls, so stay on the line and give me time to answer.\" \"I will.\" She squeezed my arm. \"And don\u0027t you dare get killed,\" she said. There\u0027s a meeting every weeknight at my home group at St. Paul the Apostle. A home group is like family, and I wanted to be there, but it was too soon to face a lot of shared memories of Jim and questions about what exactly had happened to him. In a small town I\u0027d have had a problem, but I was in New York and had dozens of meetings to choose from. I caught the IRT at Columbus Circle and got off at Ninety-sixth and Broadway. The meeting was in the church basement- they very often are- and I got there a few minutes early and helped myself to a cup of coffee. I didn\u0027t know anybody there, and I was just as glad. I wanted to be in a meeting, but I didn\u0027t want to talk to anybody. At eight o\u0027clock the chairman opened the meeting. He had somebody read the preamble and then introduced the speaker, a woman who looked like a young suburban matron with two kids and a golden retriever. She told a harrowing story, mostly drugs but with plenty of booze in it, told of rapes at knifepoint while trying to score smack in Harlem, told of trading blow jobs for hits on the crack pipe in Alphabet City hell-holes. She was two years sober now and she had her life back. She also had HIV, and a T-cell count that was not so hot, but so far she was otherwise asymptomatic and she had high hopes. \"Anyway,\" she said, \"I\u0027ve got today.\" During the break I put a dollar in the basket and had another cup of coffee and a stale oatmeal cookie. There were some announcements- the annual dinner dance six weeks away, some openings on the outgoing speakers\u0027 list, a member in the hospital who\u0027d appreciate calls. Then the meeting reopened for a round robin. If I\u0027d known it was going to be a round robin I probably would have gone somewhere else. I grew oddly tense as my turn approached. I suppose I knew I ought to say something, and knew too that I didn\u0027t want to.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/everybody-dies-matthew-scudder-14/page-23.html","bookId":2332,"book":{"id":2332,"title":"Everybody Dies (Matthew Scudder #14)","description":"Storyline: Everybody Dies (Matthew Scudder #14) Matt Scudder is finally leading a comfortable life.
