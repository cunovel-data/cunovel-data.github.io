{"id":64411,"no":24,"title":"Page 24","content":"\"My name is Matt,\" I said, \"and I\u0027m an alcoholic. Thanks for your qualification. It was very powerful. I think I\u0027ll just listen tonight.\" Matt the Listener. \"Matthew Scudder,\" Danny Boy said. \"First I heard you were dead. Then I heard you weren\u0027t. Logic told me that both of these reports could not be true.\" \"Where would we be without logic?\" He smiled and pointed to a chair, and I pulled it back and sat down. When the meeting ended I\u0027d walked downtown on Amsterdam and looked for him at Mother Blue\u0027s. When I didn\u0027t find him there I walked the rest of the way to Poogan\u0027s Pub, on West Seventy-second. He was at his usual table, with a bottle of iced vodka in a hamper next to him and an unconvincing transsexual in the seat opposite him. She used her hands a lot while she talked, and what she said had Danny Boy laughing. I drank a Perrier at the bar while she talked and gestured and Danny Boy laughed and listened. I didn\u0027t think he\u0027d noticed me, but at one point he looked my way and caught my eye. A little later the TS stood up- she was tall enough for basketball- and extended a hand. It was a bigger hand than any woman ever sported, with long nails painted a bright blue. Danny Boy took her huge hand in his small one and pressed it to his lips. She whooped gaily and flounced away, and then it was my turn. Seven nights a week he\u0027s at one place or the other, sitting at the table they reserve for him, listening to music (live at Mother Blue\u0027s, recorded at Poogan\u0027s), chatting up the Girlfriend of the Month, and brokering information. After the bars close- and both of his places stay open as late as the law allows- he\u0027s apt to hit an after-hours club uptown. But he gets home before the sun comes up, and stays put until it goes down. Danny Boy Bell is African-American, and the cumbersome phrase fits him better than black, because in point of fact he\u0027s whiter than white, an albino with white hair and pink eyes and pale, almost translucent skin. Sunlight\u0027s dangerous to him, and any strong light bothers him. What the whole world needs, he has often said, is a dimmer switch. I sat where the TS had been sitting, and Danny Boy picked up his glass of iced vodka and told me he was glad I was alive. \"So am I,\" I said. \"Exactly what did you hear?\" \"What I said. First the word came that you\u0027d been gunned down in a restaurant. Then the bush telegraph ran a correction. It wasn\u0027t you after all. It was somebody else.\" \"A friend of mine. I left the table and the shooter made a mistake.\" \"And didn\u0027t know it until later,\" he said. \"Because he must have reported a successful mission in order for your name to be in the first word that hit the street. Who was your friend?\" \"Nobody you would have heard of.\" \"A square john?\" \"A fellow Perrier drinker.\" \"Oh, and that\u0027s how you knew him? A close friend?\" \"Very.\" \"I\u0027m sorry to hear it. On the other hand, Matthew, I\u0027m glad you\u0027re not on my list.\" \"What list is that?\" \"Just an expression.\" \"It\u0027s a new one on me. What kind of list?\" He shrugged. \"It\u0027s just something I did awhile back. I sat down and started writing down a list of everybody I could think of who was dead.\" \"Jesus Christ.\" \"Well, he might or might not belong on the list, depending on who you talk to. Same goes for Elvis. But this particular list was limited to people I\u0027d known personally.\" \"And you wrote down their names.\" \"It sounds stupid,\" he said, \"and I think it probably was, but once I got started I couldn\u0027t seem to stop. I got pretty compulsive about it. I\u0027d think of a name and I\u0027d have to write it down. It was sort of like the Vietnam Memorial in Washington, except those guys got a wall, not some pages in a notebook. And they had something in common. They all died in the same war.\" \"And the others were all friends of yours.\" \"Not even that. Some of them I couldn\u0027t stand and others were people I just knew to say hello to. But it was a trip, Matthew. One name would lead to another, and it was like dominoes tumbling over in your memory. I found myself remembering people I hadn\u0027t thought of in years. Neighbors from when I was growing up. My pediatrician. A kid across the street who died of leukemia, and a girl in my fifth-grade class who got hit by a car. You know what I realized?\" \"What?\" \"Most of the people I know are dead. I guess that happens when you\u0027ve been around long enough. I once heard George Burns say something like that. \u0027When you\u0027re my age, most of your friends are dead.\u0027 Or words to that effect. The audience laughed, and I\u0027ve never been able to figure out why. What\u0027s funny about it? Does it seem funny to you?\" \"Maybe it was the way he said it.\" \"Maybe. And now he\u0027s dead. George Burns. But I never met him, so he\u0027s not on my list. And neither are you, because your heart\u0027s still beating, and I\u0027m glad to know it.\" \"So am I,\" I said, \"but somebody wants to put me on the list.\" \"Who?\" \"I wish I knew,\" I said, and filled him in. \"I heard it got nasty at Ballou\u0027s joint,\" he said. \"It\u0027s all over the papers. It must have been a bloodbath.\" \"It was.\" \"I can believe it. I didn\u0027t know you were there.\" \"A couple of hours ago I told a cop I wasn\u0027t.\" \"Well, I\u0027ll never say different. Ballou really doesn\u0027t know who\u0027s sticking it to him?\" \"No.\" \"Got to be the same person that ordered you hit.\" \"I would think so.\" \"Whoever he is, he\u0027s an equal opportunity employer. Hires killers in every available color. Black, white, and yellow.\" \"A few white guys, if you count the pair who braced me on the street.\" \"And you didn\u0027t recognize anybody?\" \"There was only one guy I got a really good look at. And no, I\u0027d never seen him before. Next lime I see you I\u0027ll show you his picture. In the meantime, I\u0027d like to know what you know.\" \"Less than you do, I\u0027d have to say. The big news was that you were dead, and then the not-so-big news was that the big news was bogus.\" \"The fact that I was alive was less newsworthy?\" \"What do you expect? Look at the Times. They print corrections all the time, but they don\u0027t stick them on the front page.\" He frowned. \"The other big item is that somebody\u0027s going to war with Mick Ballou, and I have to say I know a lot more about that from TV than I hear through the grapevine.\" \"Somebody\u0027s got to know something.\" \"Absolutely. The question is where do you start, and I\u0027m thinking the shooter.\" \"There were two shooters.\" \"The black one, because the yellow one\u0027s not talking, whereas the black one must be talking a blue streak, to add one more color to the palette. Incidentally, speaking of blue, how did you like Ramona\u0027s fingernails?\" \"I was meaning to ask about those. Does she paint them or is that their natural color?\" \"Matthew, if you asked her she\u0027d think you were serious. She honestly believes she\u0027s got the world fooled. She doesn\u0027t think anybody can tell.\" \"Can tell what? That she paints her nails?\" \"That she wasn\u0027t born with a pussy. That she didn\u0027t get those cantaloupe tits from a surgeon.\" \"She\u0027s what, Danny? Six-four?\" \"In her nylons. And big hands and feet, and an Adam\u0027s apple, although that\u0027s in line for a paring as soon as she gets the money together. All that and she\u0027s still convinced the whole world thinks she\u0027s the real deal. And before you even ask, you prying son of a bitch, the answer is no, I haven\u0027t.\" He poured some vodka, held it aloft, looked at the world through it. \"Not that I haven\u0027t thought about it,\" he said, and drank it down. \"You could hardly help thinking about it.\" \"She\u0027s a nice kid,\" he said. \"She makes me laugh, which gets harder and harder to do. And the size, you know. That\u0027s an attraction in itself. The contrast.\" \"Whether it was God or the medical profession,\" I said, \"somebody sure made a lot of her.\" \"Well, God made a lot of Texas, too, but that\u0027s no reason to go there. But she\u0027s attractive. Wouldn\u0027t you say she\u0027s attractive?\" \"No question.\" \"And of course she\u0027s nuts. She is genuinely out there, and, you know, I\u0027ve never regarded that as a fault in a woman.\" \"No, I\u0027ve noticed that.\" \"So I\u0027m tempted,\" he said, \"but I\u0027ve essentially decided to wait until she\u0027s had her Adam\u0027s apple done. You know, with the height difference and all, that Adam\u0027s apple would be hard for me to overlook.\" He frowned. \"Talk about losing the thread of a conversation. Where were we?\" \"The black shooter.\" \"Right, and here\u0027s what I was thinking. The word got around that you were dead. Now that word could only have come from the man who thought he shot you- before he learned otherwise. So he\u0027s a talker, and now he\u0027s got something new to talk about. It shouldn\u0027t be too hard to get a line on him. Sometimes you can backtrack a piece of information and see where it came from. Other times you sort of circle around it.\" \"Whatever works.\" \"Keep in touch, Matthew. And one other thing. The guy knows he missed, and whoever sent him knows he missed. Either he\u0027ll try again or somebody else will.\" \"I thought of that.\" \"Of course you did. That\u0027s why you\u0027ve got a bulge under your jacket. Nice jacket, by the way, bulge or no bulge.\" \"Thanks.\" \"Anyway, be careful, will you? And stay off my list.\" It was raining by the time I left Poogan\u0027s. That reminded me, and I went back for my umbrella, which I\u0027d left at Danny Boy\u0027s table. The miracle was that I hadn\u0027t left it at the meeting. Cabs disappear when it rains, and I guess it had been coming down long enough to thin their ranks. I\u0027d just about decided to walk the fifteen blocks when a cab pulled up and let out a fat black man who looked a lot like Al Roker, the jolly TV weatherman, but who was actually a pimp named Bad Dog Dunstan. If he was jolly, he\u0027d kept the word from getting out. He had two girls with him, and weighed as much as the two of them together. They hurried into Poogan\u0027s, trying to keep their hair from getting wet, while he dug a roll out of his pocket to pay the driver and I held the door so the cab wouldn\u0027t take off without me. Dunstan\u0027s eyes went wide at the sight of me, and I sensed that he\u0027d heard the big news and missed the retraction. We knew each other only by sight and had never spoken, but I didn\u0027t stand on ceremony. A passed-along cab on a rainy night seemed to me enough of an introduction. \"False alarm,\" I said. \"I\u0027m not dead yet.\" He smiled broadly, but the effect was somehow more savage than jolly. \"Glad to hear it,\" he boomed. \"We all dead soon enough. No need to rush the season.\" He went into Poogan\u0027s. I got in the cab and went home. Elaine was watching a Law \u0026 Order rerun on A\u0026E, one of the earlier shows with Michael Moriarty and Dann Florek. We\u0027d both seen the episode before, but that never seems to matter. \"I miss Michael Moriarty,\" Elaine said. \"Not that there\u0027s anything wrong with Sam Waterston.\" \"They always get good people.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/everybody-dies-matthew-scudder-14/page-24.html","bookId":2332,"book":{"id":2332,"title":"Everybody Dies (Matthew Scudder #14)","description":"Storyline: Everybody Dies (Matthew Scudder #14) Matt Scudder is finally leading a comfortable life.
