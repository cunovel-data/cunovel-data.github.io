{"id":64406,"no":19,"title":"Page 19","content":"\"But it must have been reflexive, don\u0027t you think? Something happened and he simply reacted.\" \"So?\" \"So he didn\u0027t consciously think, Matt\u0027s in danger and I have to knock him down and shield him from bullets. He just did it.\" \"Would the act have scored higher on the nobility charts if he\u0027d thought it over first? If he\u0027d stopped to think we\u0027d both be dead.\" \"You\u0027re right,\" she said. \"You see what I\u0027m doing, don\u0027t you? I\u0027m trying to minimize what he did so you won\u0027t feel obligated to him. You almost got killed twice in one night. I want you to quit the game before your luck runs out.\" \"I don\u0027t think I can do that.\" \"Why not? How does what happened change anything? If Mick saved your life it was because he wants you to live, not so you can stand shoulder to shoulder with him on the battlefield. Didn\u0027t he tell you to take me to Ireland?\" \"That\u0027s what he said.\" \"I\u0027ve never been there. And I get the feeling we\u0027re not going.\" \"Not right now.\" \"Want to tell me why?\" \"Because it really is a war,\" I said, \"and nobody\u0027s going to let me be Switzerland. What were we saying before? My name\u0027s in the shawl. The only way I could stay neutral at this point is to pack up and leave the country.\" \"So? Your passport\u0027s in order.\" I shook my head. \"I can\u0027t sit on a stone fence in County Kerry, hoping my problem will solve itself.\" \"So you\u0027re going to be involved.\" \"That\u0027s got to be better than sitting around with my thumb up my ass waiting for something to happen.\" \"Besides, the man saved your life.\" \"That\u0027s a factor.\" \"And a man\u0027s gotta do what a man\u0027s gotta do. Does that get factored in, too?\" \"It\u0027s probably part of the equation,\" I admitted. \"I may think most of that guy stuff is bullshit, but that doesn\u0027t render me immune to it. And it\u0027s not all crap. If I\u0027m going to live in this town I can\u0027t let people scare me out of it. And I have to live in this town.\" \"Why? We could live anywhere.\" \"We could, but we don\u0027t. We live here.\" \"I know,\" she said. \"This is home.\" She tried her coffee again, then gave up and carried her cup to the sink. \"It\u0027s a shame,\" she said. \"I don\u0027t know about sitting on stone fences, but it would have been fun to go to Ireland.\" \"You can still go.\" \"When? Oh, you mean now? No thanks.\" \"Or Paris, or anywhere you want.\" \"Where I\u0027ll be out of harm\u0027s way.\" \"That\u0027s right.\" \"So you won\u0027t have to worry about me.\" \"So?\" \"So forget about it. If I\u0027m gonna sit around waiting for the phone to ring, I\u0027d just as soon stay where it\u0027s a local call. Don\u0027t try to talk me around, okay? Because it won\u0027t work. I may not be a Taurus but I\u0027m just as stubborn as you are. If you won\u0027t go, neither will I.\" \"It\u0027s your call. Will you close the shop?\" \"That I\u0027ll do. I\u0027ll even hang a sign that says I\u0027m off on a buying trip until the first of October. Will this be over and done with by the end of the month?\" \"One way or another.\" \"I wish you hadn\u0027t put it that way.\" I said, \"That couple I mentioned? At Grogan\u0027s?\" \"The low-level lovers\u0027 quarrel? What about them?\" \"She\u0027s someone we used to know.\" \"Oh?\" \"Lisa Holtzmann.\" The two women had met in an art history class at Hunter. That\u0027s how I came to know her husband, and how she came to call me after he was killed. \"My God,\" she said. \"And she was killed?\" \"Instantly, from the look of things.\" \"That poor girl. What a life and what a death. Where was it we saw her?\" \"Armstrong\u0027s, and it was awhile ago.\" \"And we didn\u0027t bother saying hello. Who knew we\u0027d never see her again?\" She frowned. \"What was she doing at Grogan\u0027s? I know what she was doing, but you wouldn\u0027t think that would be her kind of place, would you?\" \"As far as I know, that\u0027s the first time she ever went there. No, that\u0027s not true, because they were there the other night.\" \"The night before last?\" \"No, the night the whole thing started. Wednesday, it would have been. Before we went over to the storage place in Jersey. She was there with the same guy, and it may have been the same table. And it wasn\u0027t his kind of place, either.\" \"Who was he?\" \"His name was Florian.\" \"Florian? First name or last?\u0027 \"First, I assume. \u0027Matt, this is Florian. Florian, this is Matt.\u0027\" \"Snappy dialogue. Florian. Did he have long hair and play a Gypsy violin?\" \"He had a wedding ring.\" \"He did and she didn\u0027t.\" \"Right.\" \"So he was married and she wasn\u0027t, and maybe that\u0027s why they were in a low-down boozer instead of some more gentrified establishment.\" She put her hand on mine. \"First Jim and then Lisa. This has been quite a night for you, hasn\u0027t it?\" \"There were a lot of others killed at Grogan\u0027s, too.\" \"You mentioned the bartender. Burke?\" \"And people I knew by sight, and others I didn\u0027t know at all. So much death.\" \"I\u0027m reeling from it myself and I wasn\u0027t even there. You were there both times.\" \"It doesn\u0027t feel real.\" \"Of course not. It\u0027s too much to take in. And you must be exhausted. Did you get any sleep at all before you went out to get shot at?\" \"That\u0027s not why I went out. And no, I couldn\u0027t even keep my eyes closed.\" \"I bet you could now.\" \"I think you\u0027re right,\" I said, and got to my feet. \"You know, I used to be able to miss a night\u0027s sleep now and then and just keep going. Of course I had an engine back then that burned alcohol for fuel.\" \"Your engine didn\u0027t have quite so many miles on it then, either.\" \"You think that\u0027s got something to do with it?\" \"Of course not,\" she said. \"You haven\u0027t lost a step. Get some sleep, slugger. Now.\" I dropped off right away, and I don\u0027t think I so much as changed position until my eyes snapped open a little past noon. I hadn\u0027t awakened that abruptly in years. It wasn\u0027t like waking up, it was like coming out of a blackout. When I\u0027d showered and shaved, Elaine met me with a cup of coffee and told me the phone had been ringing all morning. \"I let the machine pick up,\" she said. \"A lot of people who wanted to know about Jim, or who wanted to tell you about Jim. And other people, too. Names I didn\u0027t recognize and some I did. Joe Durkin, and that other cop, the one from last night.\" \"George Wister?\" \"That\u0027s the one. He called twice. The second time I thought he could see me. \u0027Please pick up the phone if you\u0027re listening to this.\u0027 Very stern, very parent-to-child, and just the sort of thing guaranteed to elicit a strong fuck-you response from moi. Needless to say, I did not pick up.\" \"What a surprise.\" \"I didn\u0027t even pick up when it was for me. It was Monica, and I wasn\u0027t in the mood to hear about her latest married boyfriend. The one time I did pick up, though, was when TJ called. He\u0027d seen the news and he wanted to make sure you were all right. I told him you were, and I also told him not to open up today. In fact I had him put a sign in the window.\" \"\u0027We Be Closed for the Month So\u0027s We Can Be Buyin\u0027 Some New Stock, Jock.\u0027\" \"I also called Beverly Faber. You can imagine how much I wanted to make that call, but I figured I had to. She sounded sedated, or maybe she was just groggy from shock and lack of sleep. The cops had her up until all hours answering questions. The impression they left her with, or maybe it\u0027s the one she wanted to be left with, is that Jim\u0027s murder was a case of mistaken identity.\" \"Well, it was.\" \"Right now she seems to see it as the workings of random fate. Do you remember when that actress dropped something out a window? I think it was a flower pot.\" \"God, that was ages ago. I was a cop when it happened. In fact I was still in Brooklyn, I hadn\u0027t transferred to the Sixth. That\u0027s how long ago it was.\" \"The flower pot fell something like sixteen stories and killed a guy walking home from dinner. Wasn\u0027t that it?\" \"Something like that. The question at the time was how the flower pot got out the window. Not that she was aiming at the poor jerk, but did it really just happen to fall or did she pick it up and throw it at somebody?\" \"And he ducked and it went out the window?\" \"Maybe. Whatever it was, it was a hell of a long time ago.\" \"Well, Beverly remembers it like it was yesterday. Her Jim was like the guy who got hit with the flower pot, just minding his business until God\u0027s thumb came down and squashed him like a bug.\" She made a face. \"You know,\" she said, \"I never liked Beverly. But I certainly felt for her, and I really wanted to like her for the duration of the phone call.\" \"I know what you mean.\" \"She\u0027s not an easy woman to like. I think it\u0027s her voice, she sounds like she\u0027s whining even when she\u0027s not. Listen, are you hungry?\" \"Starving.\" \"Well, thank God, because I was afraid I was going to have to tie you down and force-feed you. Go listen to your messages while I fix you something.\" I played the messages and jotted down names and numbers, even though I didn\u0027t much want to return any of the calls, especially the ones from either of the cops. Wister\u0027s second message was as Elaine had described it, and drew much the same response from me as it had from her. Joe Durkin\u0027s call, logged in just half an hour before I\u0027d opened my eyes, sounded at once urgent and irritated, and didn\u0027t make me eager to get him on the phone. I deleted the messages- you can\u0027t really erase them, it\u0027s digital, so there\u0027s no tape to erase. I went into the kitchen and ate everything Elaine put in front of me, and when the phone rang again I let the machine screen it. The caller hung up without leaving a message. \"There were a lot of those,\" she said. \"Hangups.\" \"There always are. A lot of the time it\u0027s telemarketers.\" \"God, do you remember my brief career as a telemarketer? What a washout I was.\" \"That wasn\u0027t telemarketing.\" \"Of course it was.\" \"It was phone sex,\" I said. \"Well, it\u0027s the same thing. Either way you\u0027re jerking people off over the phone. God, that was funny, wasn\u0027t it?\" \"You didn\u0027t think so at the time.\" \"I thought it was something I could do, and it turned out it wasn\u0027t. That was around the time I met Lisa.\" \"Right.\" \"Before you and I moved in together, and before I opened the shop. I\u0027d stopped seeing clients and I couldn\u0027t figure out what to do with the rest of my life.\" \"I remember.\" \"Matt?\" \"What?\" \"Oh, nothing.\" I rinsed my plate at the sink, put it in the rack to dry. She said, \"You\u0027ll want to call TJ.\" \"In a little while.\" \"And did you want to catch the TV news? New York One had a lot of crime scene footage.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/everybody-dies-matthew-scudder-14/page-19.html","bookId":2332,"book":{"id":2332,"title":"Everybody Dies (Matthew Scudder #14)","description":"Storyline: Everybody Dies (Matthew Scudder #14) Matt Scudder is finally leading a comfortable life.
