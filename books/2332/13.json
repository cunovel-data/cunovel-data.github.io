{"id":64400,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"\"It didn\u0027t come up in conversation a lot. A couple of years ago he was talking about packing it in.\" \"Getting out of the business?\" \"He was tired of it and I guess business was slow enough to be discouraging. For a while he was looking into buying a coffee bar franchise. This was back when there was a new one opening every time you turned around.\" \"My brother-in-law bought one,\" Wister said. \"It\u0027s been a pretty good thing for him, but they\u0027re working every minute, him and my sister both.\" \"Anyway, he decided against it and stayed with the printshop. Sometimes he talked about retiring, but I never got the impression he was ready to do it.\" \"It says here he was sixty-three.\" \"That sounds about right.\" \"He in a position to retire?\" \"I have no idea.\" \"He didn\u0027t talk about investments or debts, anything like that?\" \"No.\" He probed his chin stubble. \"Anything about a criminal element?\" \"A criminal element?\" \"Trying to muscle in on his business, say.\" \"If anyone tried,\" I said, \"he\u0027d have handed them the keys and wished them the best of luck. He squeezed a living out of the business, but it\u0027s not something you get rich at, not something a gangster would want to take over.\" \"He do any work for them?\" \"For gangsters?\" \"For organized crime.\" \"Jesus,\" I said. \"It\u0027s not as farfetched as it sounds, Matt. Criminal enterprises need the same kinds of goods and services as everybody else. They need letterhead and invoice forms and order blanks and, yes, business cards, and God knows what else. They own a lot of restaurants, so they\u0027re always getting menus printed. No reason your friend couldn\u0027t have done some of their printing. He wouldn\u0027t necessarily have known who he was doing it for.\" \"I suppose it\u0027s possible, but- \" \"It\u0027s also possible they\u0027d have asked him to print up something that wasn\u0027t kosher. To duplicate government forms or somebody else\u0027s purchase order blanks, something dubious like that. Maybe he went along, maybe he refused to go along, maybe he learned something along the way he was better off not knowing.\" \"What\u0027s your point?\" \"What\u0027s my point? My point is your friend Faber was the victim of what looks like a very professional hit. Those guys don\u0027t shoot you just to keep in practice, if he was mobbed up in any kind of way, innocent or otherwise, you\u0027re doing him no favor by keeping it a secret.\" \"Believe me, I\u0027m not keeping any secrets.\" \"Can you think of anybody who\u0027d want to see him dead?\" \"No.\" \"Anyone associated with him who might have paid to have him killed? Or anyone in the criminal world who might have had any kind of a grudge against him?\" \"Same answer.\" \"You arrived at the restaurant, you sat down at the table. What was his state of mind?\" \"Same as always. Calm, serene.\" \"Nothing bothering him, far as you could tell?\" \"Nothing that showed.\" \"What did you talk about?\" \"Anything and everything. Oh, you mean tonight?\" \"You were with him a minute or two before you went to the john. What did the two of you talk about?\" I had to think. Ike and Mike, and then what? \"Air conditioning,\" I said. \"Air conditioning?\" \"Air conditioning. They had theirs turned up so it was like an icebox in there, and we talked about that.\" \"Small talk, in other words.\" \"Too small to remember.\" He took another tack, asked me if I\u0027d got even the slightest glimpse of the shooter. I said what I\u0027d been saying all along, that he was out the door and gone before I got back from the men\u0027s room. \"Now memory\u0027s a funny thing,\" he said. \"Different things affect it. Your mind doesn\u0027t want to let a piece of information in, it walls off a section of memory and won\u0027t give you access to it.\" \"I could give you examples,\" I said, \"but that\u0027s not what happened here. I was in the john when I heard the gunshots. I came running, I saw what had happened, and I chased out into the street hoping to get a look at him.\" \"And you never saw him.\" \"Never.\" \"So you don\u0027t know if he was tall or short, fat or thin, black or white…\" \"I understand the witnesses said he was black.\" \"But you didn\u0027t see him yourself.\" \"No.\" \"Or any black man in the restaurant.\" \"I didn\u0027t pay much attention to the other customers, before or after the shooting. But the place was close to empty, and no, I don\u0027t believe any of the other people in it were black.\" \"How about seeing a car pulling away, which you didn\u0027t happen to take note of at the time?\" \"I\u0027d have taken notice, because that\u0027s what I was looking for, either a man on foot or a car puffing away.\" \"But you didn\u0027t see either one.\" \"No.\" \"Or a cab or…\" \"No.\" \"And now you can\u0027t come up with anyone with a reason to want James Faber dead.\" I shook my head. \"Not to say no such person exists,\" I said, \"but I can\u0027t think of him, and I\u0027ve got no reason to believe in his existence.\" \"Except for what happened tonight.\" \"Except for that.\" \"How about yourself, Matt?\" I stared hard at him. \"I must be missing something here,\" I said levelly. \"Are you really suggesting I set him up and ducked into the bathroom so some gunman I\u0027d hired could come in and start blasting?\" \"Take it easy…\" \"Because that\u0027s so far off base I didn\u0027t even know how to react to it.\" \"Easy,\" he said. \"Sit down, Matt. That\u0027s not at all what I was getting at.\" \"It\u0027s not?\" \"Not at all.\" \"That\u0027s what it sounded like.\" \"Well, then, that\u0027s my fault, because it\u0027s not what I intended. I said \u0027How about you?\u0027 meaning is there anybody with a reason to have you hit.\" \"Oh.\" \"But you thought…\" \"I know what I thought. I\u0027m sorry I went off like that.\" \"Well, you didn\u0027t yell and scream, but your face got so dark I was afraid you were going to stroke out on me.\" \"I guess I\u0027m more exhausted than I realized,\" I said. \"You\u0027re saying the shooter could have got the wrong man?\" \"It\u0027s always possible when the shooter doesn\u0027t know the vic personally. Faber was what, a couple of years older?\" \"I\u0027m taller by a few inches, and he was heavier, and thicker in the middle. I don\u0027t think we looked much alike. Nobody ever called me Jim by mistake, I\u0027ll tell you that much.\" \"You have any old enemies? From when you were on the job, say?\" \"That\u0027s over twenty years ago, George. I\u0027m off the job longer than I was ever on it.\" \"Well, what enemies have you made lately? You\u0027re a PI. You working on any mob-related cases?\" \"No.\" \"Anything at all where you might have rubbed some hard case the wrong way?\" \"Nothing,\" I said. \"These days I work mostly for lawyers, checking out witnesses in personal injury and product liability lawsuits. I got a kid with a computer who does most of the heavy lifting for me.\" \"So you can\u0027t think of a thing.\" \"No.\" \"Well, why don\u0027t you run on home, then? Sleep on it, see what comes to you overnight. You know how it\u0027s probably going to turn out, don\u0027t you?\" \"How?\" \"Mistaken identity. I got a feeling what happened, and God knows it wouldn\u0027t be the first time. Somebody saw your friend, mistook him for a mope who burned him in a drug deal, or dicked his wife, some damned fool thing. Or, and I\u0027ve known of cases, there\u0027s a contract out on some guy, some poor bastard looked nothing like your friend, and somebody spots him and drops a dime on him, and the guy who gets the call goes to the wrong fucking Chinese restaurant. He shows up at the Lucky Panda on Eighth instead of the Golden Rabbit on Seventh or the Hoo Flung Poo on Ninth.\" \"Maybe.\" \"The moon\u0027s full, you know.\" \"I didn\u0027t notice.\" \"Well, it\u0027s overcast. You can\u0027t see it, but it\u0027s on the calendar. Tomorrow night, actually, but that\u0027s close enough. That\u0027s when weird shit happens.\" I remembered the moon Wednesday night, the gibbous moon. And now it was full. \"So go on home. There\u0027s uniforms chasing down witnesses now, taking testimony from people who were on the street when it went down, or maybe looking out their windows, wondering is it ever gonna rain. You know how it works. We\u0027ll check everything out, we\u0027ll see what our snitches have to tell us, and if we get lucky we\u0027ll come up with the shitbag who pulled the trigger.\" He worried his chin. \"It won\u0027t bring him back, your friend,\" he said, \"but it\u0027s what we do. It\u0027s all we can do.\" I walked home on Ninth Avenue. I passed a few bars along the way, and each time I felt my heart race just the least little bit at the sight of them. It was an appropriate response. I couldn\u0027t stand the movie that was playing in my head, and booze was a sure bet to drown the sound track and fade the image to black. Here\u0027s looking at you, Jim. Down the hatch. Bombs away. Mud in your eye, fella. Thanks for helping me stay sober for the past sixteen years. Who\u0027s to say I could have done it without you? And now I\u0027ll honor your memory by forgetting everything you taught me No, I don\u0027t think so. Jim stopped watching NYPD Blue when Sipowicz drank after his son\u0027s death. What a jerk, he said. What a fucking asshole. He can\u0027t help it, I said. He\u0027s just a character, all he can do is what it says in the script. I\u0027m talking about the writer, he said. So I wasn\u0027t going to pick up a drink, but I couldn\u0027t pretend the desire wasn\u0027t there. My eyes took note of each gin joint, each winking neon beer sign. My mouth may have watered a little. But my feet kept on walking. I looked for the moon, the full moon, but couldn\u0027t see it. Anxiety grabbed me as I walked into the lobby of our building, and in the elevator I had a sudden vision of what I was going to find on the fourteenth floor. The door kicked in, furniture overturned, pictures slashed. And worse… The door was shut and locked. I rang the bell before I used my key, and Elaine was on the other side of the door when I got it open. She started to say something and stopped when she got a look at my face. \"Jim\u0027s dead,\" I said. \"I got him killed.\" \"I suppose I was in shock,\" I said, \"and I suppose I still am, to some extent. But no matter how thick the fog got, I never lost sight of my commitment to the obstruction of justice.\" \"Because you didn\u0027t tell them everything?\" \"Because I deliberately misled them and withheld information I knew to be pertinent. I sat there parrying questions about Jim\u0027s printing business when it was crystal clear to me why he was killed. The shooter made a mistake, all right, and it had nothing to do with phases of the moon. He was supposed to shoot a middle-aged guy in khakis and a windbreaker and a red polo shirt, and that\u0027s what he did.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/everybody-dies-matthew-scudder-14/page-13.html","bookId":2332,"book":{"id":2332,"title":"Everybody Dies (Matthew Scudder #14)","description":"Storyline: Everybody Dies (Matthew Scudder #14) Matt Scudder is finally leading a comfortable life.
