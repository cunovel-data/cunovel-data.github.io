He said, \"I don\u0027t know what happened, I swear I don\u0027t I guess it was the carrot and the stick both at once. He said I got table scraps from you, that there\u0027d be a lot of money if I threw in with him. And he said I\u0027d be dead if I didn\u0027t. And her with me.\"\\n\\n \"Your mother.\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"You should have come straight to me, Andy.\"\\n\\n \"I know. God, I know. I never thought…\"\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" he said. \"I don\u0027t know what I thought. What difference does it make? You\u0027re gonna kill me. Well, hell, go ahead. I can\u0027t say I don\u0027t deserve it.\"\\n\\n \"Ah, Andy,\" he said. \"Why would I kill you?\"\\n\\n \"We both know why. God knows I gave you cause.\"\\n\\n \"Didn\u0027t I tell you we\u0027ve a great national tradition of informing? You made your bed, but why lie in it if you can make it again?\"\\n\\n \"What do you mean?\"\\n\\n Mick clapped him on the shoulder. \"You changed sides,\" he said, \"and now you\u0027ll change \u0027em again and come back where you belong. They\u0027ve set a trap for us, have they? We\u0027ll have at them, the three of us, and see them caught in their own trap.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027d let me come back?\"\\n\\n \"And why not? Jesus, you\u0027ve been with me for years and against me for days. We need each other, Andy.\"\\n\\n \"Mick, I\u0027m a bastard. You\u0027re a good man and I\u0027m nothing but a bastard.\"\\n\\n \"Forget that for now.\"\\n\\n \"Mick, we can do it. They\u0027re expecting us to drive in like we own the place. Then I park the car where I always park it and I hang back and smoke a cigarette while you and Matt go up to the house. And they come out of the house with guns in their hands.\"\\n\\n \"It was a good plan. Would they have a sentry posted, do you think? Someone to spot us when we turn into the drive?\"\\n\\n \"They might.\"\\n\\n \"I would,\" he said, \"in their place. I\u0027d put someone where he could see the headlights. What about O\u0027Gara? Have they killed him yet?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know. They didn\u0027t tell me much. Tom Heaney\u0027s landlady, that took me by surprise. I didn\u0027t think they would do that, I really didn\u0027t.\"\\n\\n \"And it bothers you, but is it worse than killing poor Tom? Ah, let it go. Talk won\u0027t bring him back, or any of the others. John Kenny and Barry McCartney. You knew they were going to the storage place. You went along with Dowling, didn\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n \"I stayed outside,\" he said, \"So they wouldn\u0027t see me. It was supposed to be a straight hijack, and I was going to drive the truck. Then I heard the shots.\" He took a breath. \"I didn\u0027t know there was going to be any killing, Mick. It started out as a way to steal from you. They were going to grab the liquor and sell it and I was going to get a cut.\"\\n\\n \"And no one was going to get hurt.\"\\n\\n \"Not the way I heard it. And then Barry and John were dead and I was in the middle of it And then it just fucking grew.\"\\n\\n \"Out of control,\" Mick said. \"Like wildfire.\"\\n\\n \"Worse.\"\\n\\n \"Worse. Peter Rooney, and Burke, and all those that died at Grogan\u0027s. And Matt\u0027s friend, that went to retreat with the Zen Buddhists. And myself saved for last. Didn\u0027t they try to get you to do it, Andy? It would have been easy for you. A bullet in the back of the head when I was looking the other way. Easier than setting up at the farm and luring me there.\"\\n\\n \"I could never do it, Mick.\"\\n\\n \"No, I didn\u0027t think you could.\"\\n\\n \"And he wants to do it himself. He hates you.\"\\n\\n \"He does.\"\\n\\n \"He says you killed his father. I don\u0027t know if he ever saw the man, and what\u0027s it matter anyway? It\u0027s ancient fucking history, for Christ\u0027s sake.\"\\n\\n \"So\u0027s the Battle of the Boyne,\" Mick said, \"and yet there\u0027s some that never got over it. Ah, Andy. It had to be you or Tom, and once I saw Tom dead that left only yourself. It broke my heart, knowing that.\"\\n\\n \"Mick…\"\\n\\n \"But you\u0027re back, and that\u0027s what counts. It\u0027s good to have you back, Andy.\"\\n\\n \"Jesus, Mick. You\u0027ll never have to worry about me again. I swear to God, Mick.\"\\n\\n \"Ah, don\u0027t I know it?\" he said, and rested a cupped hand at the back of Andy\u0027s head, and put his other hand beneath Andy\u0027s chin, and moved both hands, and broke Andy Buckley\u0027s neck.\\n\\n \"What choice did I have? What else could I do?\"\\n\\n I didn\u0027t have an answer. He got the keys from the ignition, walked around to the trunk, unlocked it. He came back and picked up Andy\u0027s corpse without any apparent effort and carried him on his shoulder, then laid him gently in the trunk and slammed the lid. The noise when it swung shut was sharp and sudden on that dark and silent country road.\\n\\n \"No choice at all,\" he said, \"and I swear I didn\u0027t want to do it.\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t think you were going to,\" I said. \"Not then, at any rate. You took me by surprise.\"\\n\\n \"And him as well, I shouldn\u0027t wonder. I wanted to give him a bit of hope, you know, and put him at his ease. It\u0027s fear that\u0027s hardest on a man, and I wanted to spare him that. As it was, there must have been an instant when he knew what was happening, and then it was over. Ah, Christ, it\u0027s a bad old world.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s that, all right.\"\\n\\n \"A hard life in a bad old world. He was as close as I\u0027ll ever come to having a son. Paddy Farrelly got himself a son, as like as not by forcing himself on the Dowling bitch, and his boy\u0027s painting the city with blood to avenge his father\u0027s memory. And my son\u0027s helping him do it.\" He steadied himself, drew a breath. \"Except he\u0027s not my son and never was. Just a decent lad who never added up to much. A good steady hand, with a dart or a steering wheel. Do you think I should have let him live?\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t answer that.\"\\n\\n \"What would you have done yourself? You can answer that, can\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n \"You could never trust him,\" I said.\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"Or rest easy, knowing what he\u0027d done. All those people, all that blood. Being the man you are, I don\u0027t see how you could have acted differently.\"\\n\\n \"Being the man I am.\"\\n\\n \"Well, you\u0027ve never been one to forgive and forget.\"\\n\\n \"No,\" he said. \"I never have. And too old to learn new tricks, I\u0027d have to say.\" He bent down, picked up a pack of Marlboros Andy had dropped. \"A clue,\" he said ironically, \"and now it\u0027s got my prints on it. And who gives a fuck, anyway?\" He flung the pack across the road bent down again and came up with Andy\u0027s Zippo lighter. I thought he was going to throw that as well but he frowned at it and stuck it in his pocket. Then he reached to scoop up a handful of gravel and hurled that after the cigarettes.\\n\\n I waited while he leaned against the side of the car and let the fury drain out of him. Then in an entirely different tone of voice he said, \"What they don\u0027t know is there\u0027s another way onto the property. It backs up against state land, you know. And there\u0027s a back road goes into the state land, and then you can walk through a few acres of woods and you\u0027re on my land out behind the old orchard. They\u0027ll only know to watch the driveway, and they\u0027ll be waiting for three men in a car, not two men on foot.\"\\n\\n \"That gives us a little bit of an edge.\"\\n\\n \"And we\u0027ll need it, as there\u0027s two of us and who knows how many of them. I should have asked him how many they had, but would he even have known?\"\\n\\n \"There were the two who mugged me. Donnie Scalzo and the one whose face I never did see. The Vietnamese is dead, but his partner Moon Gafter\u0027s still around, and he\u0027ll probably be on hand for the finale. That\u0027s three, and Dowling makes four, but there could be one or two others we don\u0027t know about.\"\\n\\n \"Four at a minimum,\" he said. \"Very likely five, and possibly six. All arrayed against the two of us. They\u0027re defending and we\u0027re on the attack, which is to their advantage, but we know the ground better than they do. We\u0027ve a bit of the home field advantage.\"\\n\\n \"And the element of surprise.\"\\n\\n \"And that,\" he agreed. \"But, you know, I\u0027m presuming something, and I\u0027ve no right to. Because you don\u0027t have to be a part of the rest of it. You can go home.\"\\n\\n I just shook my head. \"It\u0027s too late for that,\" I said. \"Unless we both go home. They set a trap and you figured it out and walked away from it, and took out the man who set it. You could walk away and let them figure out what to do next.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027d rather deal with them now, while I\u0027ve got them all bottled up in there.\"\\n\\n \"I agree. And I\u0027ll be there with you.\"\\n\\n We got in the car. He started it up. I found myself trying to determine if the car felt any lighter now that we didn\u0027t have Andy with us anymore, and then I remembered that the weight was the same. He\u0027d been behind the wheel before, and now he was in the trunk.\\n\\n \"I had a feeling, you know.\"\\n\\n \"About Andy.\"\\n\\n \"From early on, it must have been. After the trouble at the bar, I made sure I dropped him off and kept the car. I didn\u0027t want him to know where I was staying. And I didn\u0027t let him have the cell phone number.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know about the second sight,\" I said, \"but I\u0027d say you have good instincts.\"\\n\\n \"And that may be all it is,\" he said, \"but I don\u0027t know. Let me concentrate now, we\u0027ve got our turn coming up and it\u0027s an easy one to miss. Ah, will you look at that!\"\\n\\n Ahead of us, a whole herd of deer bounded one after another across the narrow road. I counted eight of them, and I may have missed one.\\n\\n \"They\u0027re hard on crops and shrubbery,\" he said, \"and a fucking menace on the highway, but what a beautiful sight they are. Why the hell would anybody want to shoot them?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve got a friend in Ohio, a cop named Havlicek, who\u0027s always trying to get me to go out there and hunt deer with him. He can\u0027t understand why I\u0027m not interested, and I can\u0027t understand why he is.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s enough of a strain killing people,\" he said. \"I\u0027ve no time to waste on deer.\"\\n\\n He found the back road he was looking for and we made our turn. Half a mile in there was a chain across the road with a sign on it announcing that access was forbidden except to authorized personnel. I got out and unhooked the chain. He drove through and I replaced the chain and got back in the car.\\n\\n We followed the one-lane road through the woods. I couldn\u0027t say how far we drove. We crept along slowly, rarely going over ten miles an hour. I kept waiting for more deer to explode out of cover in front of us, and God knows the woods were full of them, but we didn\u0027t see any others.\\n\\n Eventually the road ran out in a small clearing. There was a little cabin there, and a canvas-topped 4WD utility vehicle parked not far from it. Mick reached into the back of the Chevy and went through the leather satchel, selecting some of its contents and adding them to a dun-gray canvas sack. He took mostly guns and extra ammunition, and left behind the money and papers from the safe. He\u0027d already grabbed up a red plastic flashlight from the glove box, and on a hunch I checked the utility vehicle. It was unlocked, as I\u0027d figured it would be, and it had a flashlight mounted on a clamp above the passenger door, encased in hard black rubber and twice as bright as the one from the Caprice.\\n\\n \"Good man,\" Mick said. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/everybody-dies-matthew-scudder-14/page-40.html","bookId":2332,"book":{"id":2332,"title":"Everybody Dies (Matthew Scudder #14)","description":"Storyline: Everybody Dies (Matthew Scudder #14) \\n Matt Scudder is finally leading a comfortable life.
