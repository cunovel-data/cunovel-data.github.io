{"id":5503,"no":5,"title":"Chapter 5","content":"5:1 [hgb] 我 妹 子 ， 我 新 妇 ， 我 进 了 我 的 园 中 ， 采 了 我 的 没 药 和 香 料 ， 吃 了 我 的 蜜 房 和 蜂 蜜 。 喝 了 我 的 酒 和 奶 。 我 的 朋 友 们 ， 请 吃 ， 我 所 亲 爱 的 ， 请 喝 ， 且 多 多 地 喝 。 [kjv] I am come into my garden, my sister, my spouse: I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk: eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved. [bbe] I have come into my garden, my sister, my bride; to take my myrrh with my spice; my wax with my honey; my wine with my milk. Take meat, O friends; take wine, yes, be overcome with love. 5:2 [hgb] 我 身 睡 卧 ， 我 心 却 醒 。 这 是 我 良 人 的 声 音 。 他 敲 门 ， 说 ， 我 的 妹 子 ， 我 的 佳 偶 ， 我 的 鸽 子 ， 我 的 完 全 人 ， 求 你 给 我 开 门 ， 因 我 的 头 满 了 露 水 ， 我 的 头 发 被 夜 露 滴 湿 。 [kjv] I sleep, but my heart waketh: it is the voice of my beloved that knocketh, saying, Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled: for my head is filled with dew, and my locks with the drops of the night. [bbe] I am sleeping, but my heart is awake; it is the sound of my loved one at the door, saying, Be open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my very beautiful one; my head is wet with dew, and my hair with the drops of the night. 5:3 [hgb] 我 回 答 说 ， 我 脱 了 衣 裳 ， 怎 能 再 穿 上 呢 ？ 我 洗 了 脚 ， 怎 能 再 玷 污 呢 ？ [kjv] I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them? [bbe] I have put off my coat; how may I put it on? My feet are washed; how may I make them unclean? 5:4 [hgb] 我 的 良 人 从 门 孔 里 伸 进 手 来 ， 我 便 因 他 动 了 心 。 [kjv] My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door, and my bowels were moved for him. [bbe] My loved one put his hand on the door, and my heart was moved for him. 5:5 [hgb] 我 起 来 ， 要 给 我 良 人 开 门 。 我 的 两 手 滴 下 没 药 ， 我 的 指 头 有 没 药 汁 滴 在 门 闩 上 。 [kjv] I rose up to open to my beloved; and my hands dropped with myrrh, and my fingers with sweet smelling myrrh, upon the handles of the lock. [bbe] I got up to let my loved one in; and my hands were dropping with myrrh, and my fingers with liquid myrrh, on the lock of the door. 5:6 [hgb] 我 给 我 的 良 人 开 了 门 。 我 的 良 人 却 已 转 身 走 了 。 他 说 话 的 时 候 ， 我 神 不 守 舍 。 我 寻 找 他 ， 竟 寻 不 见 。 我 呼 叫 他 ， 他 却 不 回 答 。 [kjv] I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdrawn himself, and was gone: my soul failed when he spake: I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer. [bbe] I made the door open to my loved one; but my loved one had taken himself away, and was gone, my soul was feeble when his back was turned on me; I went after him, but I did not come near him; I said his name, but he gave me no answer. 5:7 [hgb] 城 中 巡 逻 看 守 的 人 遇 见 我 ， 打 了 我 ， 伤 了 我 。 看 守 城 墙 的 人 夺 去 我 的 披 肩 。 [kjv] The watchmen that went about the city found me, they smote me, they wounded me; the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me. [bbe] The keepers who go about the town overtook me; they gave me blows and wounds; the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me. 5:8 [hgb] 耶 路 撒 冷 的 众 女 子 阿 ， 我 嘱 咐 你 们 。 若 遇 见 我 的 良 人 ， 要 告 诉 他 ， 我 因 思 爱 成 病 。 [kjv] I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if ye find my beloved, that ye tell him, that I am sick of love. [bbe] I say to you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if you see my loved one, what will you say to him? That I am overcome with love. 5:9 [hgb] 你 这 女 子 中 极 美 丽 的 ， 你 的 良 人 ， 比 别 人 的 良 人 有 何 强 处 。 你 的 良 人 ， 比 别 人 的 良 人 有 何 强 处 ， 你 就 这 样 嘱 咐 我 们 。 [kjv] What is thy beloved more than another beloved, O thou fairest among women? what is thy beloved more than another beloved, that thou dost so charge us? [bbe] What is your loved one more than another, O fairest among women? What is your loved one more than another, that you say this to us? 5:10 [hgb] 我 的 良 人 ， 白 而 且 红 ， 超 乎 万 人 之 上 。 [kjv] My beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefest among ten thousand. [bbe] My loved one is white and red, the chief among ten thousand. 5:11 [hgb] 他 的 头 像 至 精 的 金 子 。 他 的 头 发 厚 密 累 垂 ， 黑 如 乌 鸦 。 [kjv] His head is as the most fine gold, his locks are bushy, and black as a raven. [bbe] His head is as the most delicate gold; his hair is thick, and black as a raven. 5:12 [hgb] 他 的 眼 如 溪 水 旁 的 鸽 子 眼 ， 用 奶 洗 净 ， 安 得 合 式 。 [kjv] His eyes are as the eyes of doves by the rivers of waters, washed with milk, and fitly set. [bbe] His eyes are as the eyes of doves by the water streams, washed with milk, and rightly placed. 5:13 [hgb] 他 的 两 腮 如 香 花 畦 ， 如 香 草 台 。 他 的 嘴 唇 像 百 合 花 ， 且 滴 下 没 药 汁 。 [kjv] His cheeks are as a bed of spices, as sweet flowers: his lips like lilies, dropping sweet smelling myrrh. [bbe] His face is as beds of spices, giving out perfumes of every sort; his lips like lilies, dropping liquid myrrh. 5:14 [hgb] 他 的 两 手 好 像 金 管 ， 镶 嵌 水 苍 玉 。 他 的 身 体 如 同 雕 刻 的 象 牙 ， 周 围 镶 嵌 蓝 宝 石 。 [kjv] His hands are as gold rings set with the beryl: his belly is as bright ivory overlaid with sapphires. [bbe] His hands are as rings of gold ornamented with beryl-stones; his body is as a smooth plate of ivory covered with sapphires. 5:15 [hgb] 他 的 腿 好 像 白 玉 石 柱 ， 安 在 精 金 座 上 。 他 的 形 状 如 利 巴 嫩 ， 且 佳 美 如 香 柏 树 。 [kjv] His legs are as pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold: his countenance is as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars. [bbe] His legs are as pillars of stone on a base of delicate gold; his looks are as Lebanon, beautiful as the cedar-tree. 5:16 [hgb] 他 的 口 极 其 甘 甜 。 他 全 然 可 爱 。 耶 路 撒 冷 的 众 女 子 阿 ， 这 是 我 的 良 人 ， 这 是 我 的 朋 友 。 [kjv] His mouth is most sweet: yea, he is altogether lovely. This is my beloved, and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem. [bbe] His mouth is most sweet; yes, he is all beautiful. This is my loved one, and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/126/1842.html","bookId":179,"book":{"id":179,"title":"雅歌 Song of Songs","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 所 罗 门 的 歌 ， 是 歌 中 的 雅 歌 。 [kjv] The song of songs, which is Solomon\u0027s.
