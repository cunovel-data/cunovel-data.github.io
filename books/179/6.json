[bbe] Where is your loved one gone, O most fair among women? Where is your loved one turned away, that we may go looking for him with you? 6:2 [hgb] 我 的 良 人 下 入 自 己 园 中 ， 到 香 花 畦 ， 在 园 内 牧 放 群 羊 ， 采 百 合 花 。 [kjv] My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies. [bbe] My loved one is gone down into his garden, to the beds of spices, to take food in the gardens, and to get lilies. 6:3 [hgb] 我 属 我 的 良 人 ， 我 的 良 人 也 属 我 。 他 在 百 合 花 中 牧 放 群 羊 。 [kjv] I am my beloved\u0027s, and my beloved is mine: he feedeth among the lilies. [bbe] I am for my loved one, and my loved one is for me; he takes food among the lilies. 6:4 [hgb] 我 的 佳 偶 阿 ， 你 美 丽 如 得 撒 ， 秀 美 如 耶 路 撒 冷 ， 威 武 如 展 开 旌 旗 的 军 队 。 [kjv] Thou art beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem, terrible as an army with banners. [bbe] You are beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, as fair as Jerusalem; you are to be feared like an army with flags. 6:5 [hgb] 求 你 掉 转 眼 目 不 看 我 ， 因 你 的 眼 目 使 我 惊 乱 。 你 的 头 发 如 同 山 羊 群 卧 在 基 列 山 旁 。 [kjv] Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me: thy hair is as a flock of goats that appear from Gilead. [bbe] Let your eyes be turned away from me; see, they have overcome me; your hair is as a flock of goats which take their rest on the side of Gilead. 6:6 [hgb] 你 的 牙 齿 如 一 群 母 羊 ， 洗 净 上 来 。 个 个 都 有 双 生 ， 没 有 一 只 丧 掉 子 的 。 [kjv] Thy teeth are as a flock of sheep which go up from the washing, whereof every one beareth twins, and there is not one barren among them. [bbe] Your teeth are like a flock of sheep which come up from the washing; every one has two lambs, and there is not one without young. 6:7 [hgb] 你 的 两 太 阳 在 帕 子 内 ， 如 同 一 块 石 榴 。 [kjv] As a piece of a pomegranate are thy temples within thy locks. [bbe] Like pomegranate fruit are the sides of your head under your veil. 6:8 [hgb] 有 六 十 王 后 八 十 妃 嫔 ， 并 有 无 数 的 童 女 。 [kjv] There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, and virgins without number. [bbe] There are sixty queens, and eighty servant-wives, and young girls without number. 6:9 [hgb] 我 的 鸽 子 ， 我 的 完 全 人 ， 只 有 这 一 个 是 她 母 亲 独 生 的 。 是 生 养 她 者 所 宝 爱 的 。 众 女 子 见 了 ， 就 称 她 有 福 。 王 后 妃 嫔 见 了 ， 也 赞 美 她 。 [kjv] My dove, my undefiled is but one; she is the only one of her mother, she is the choice one of her that bare her. The daughters saw her, and blessed her; yea, the queens and the concubines, and they praised her. [bbe] My dove, my very beautiful one, is but one; she is the only one of her mother, she is the dearest one of her who gave her birth. The daughters saw her, and gave her a blessing; yes, the queens and the servant-wives, and they gave her praises. 6:10 [hgb] 那 向 外 观 看 ， 如 晨 光 发 现 ， 美 丽 如 月 亮 ， 皎 洁 如 日 头 ， 威 武 如 展 开 旌 旗 军 队 的 是 谁 呢 ？ [kjv] Who is she that looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners? [bbe] Who is she, looking down as the morning light, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, who is to be feared like an army with flags? 6:11 [hgb] 我 下 入 核 桃 园 ， 要 看 谷 中 青 绿 的 植 物 ， 要 看 葡 萄 发 芽 没 有 ， 石 榴 开 花 没 有 。 [kjv] I went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the valley, and to see whether the vine flourished, and the pomegranates budded. [bbe] I went down into the garden of nuts to see the green plants of the valley, and to see if the vine was in bud, and the pomegranate-trees were in flower. 6:12 [hgb] 不 知 不 觉 ， 我 的 心 将 我 安 置 在 我 尊 长 的 车 中 。 [kjv] Or ever I was aware, my soul made me like the chariots of Amminadib. [bbe] Before I was conscious of it, ... 6:13 [hgb] 回 来 ， 回 来 ， 书 拉 密 女 。 你 回 来 ， 你 回 来 ， 使 我 们 得 观 看 你 。 你 们 为 何 要 观 看 书 拉 密 女 ， 像 观 看 玛 哈 念 跳 舞 的 呢 ？ [kjv] Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may look upon thee. What will ye see in the Shulamite? As it were the company of two armies. [bbe] Come back, come back, O Shulammite; come back, come back, so that our eyes may see you. What will you see in the Shulammite? A sword-dance.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/126/1843.html","bookId":179,"book":{"id":179,"title":"雅歌 Song of Songs","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 所 罗 门 的 歌 ， 是 歌 中 的 雅 歌 。 [kjv] The song of songs, which is Solomon\u0027s.
