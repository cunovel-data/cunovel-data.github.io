But Ayden Cross is done walking on the wild side with bad boys. She doesn’t want to give in to the heat she sees in Jet’s dark, haunted eyes. She’s afraid of getting burned from the sparks of their spontaneous combustion, even as his touch sets her on fire. \n Jet can’t resist the Southern Belle with mile-long legs in cowboy boots who defies his every expectation. Yet the closer he feels to Ayden, the less he seems to know her. While he’s tempted to get under her skin and undo her in every way, he knows firsthand what happens to two people with very different ideas about relationships. \n Will the blaze burn into an enduring love. . . or will it consume their dreams and turn them to ashes?\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/jet-marked-men-2.jpg","author":"Jay Crownover","type":"Young Adult","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":48,"category":{"id":9,"name":"Young Adult","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
