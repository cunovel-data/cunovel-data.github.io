{"id":36919,"no":12,"title":"CHAPTER XII THE ALEXANDRA SAILS AWAY","content":"\n Next morning Pen was late, for her, in getting down-stairs, and her father was before her. He had already been out-of-doors and had heard the startling news. He was pale with excitement, and his expression presented a comical mixture of elation and outraged parental authority. \n \n \"What is this?\" he cried. \"Counsell is caught? And caught by you!\" \n \n \"That pleases you, doesn\u0027t it?\" said Pen, in a quiet way very aggravating to an excited man. \n \n \"Pleases me?\" he cried. \"My daughter starting out at night on such an errand! Wandering around the woods with a gun! Pleases me!\" He ended on a more human note. \"You might have told me when you came in, instead of letting me learn it from strangers!\" \n \n \"I was all in,\" said Pen simply. \"I couldn\u0027t face the added excitement even of telling you.\" \n \n \"Um! Humph! Ha!\" he snorted. \"What will become of your reputation?\" \n \n \"Mr. Riever didn\u0027t seemed to think it had suffered,\" Pen murmured slyly. \n \n \"Ha! ... Well, of course he wouldn\u0027t say so! ... I sha\u0027n\u0027t be able to sleep quietly for thinking what might have happened!\" \n \n Pen saw that the indignant parent only wanted to put himself on record, and that underneath the man was delighted. She went ahead and gave him his breakfast. He ate it in a charming humor. \n \n Afterwards she went about her household chores waiting for Riever, sick with anxiety. Suppose he didn\u0027t come? Suppose even then, the yacht was getting ready to sail? She couldn\u0027t go out to see. She simply could not humiliate her pride to the extent of going down to the wharf to look for her money. \n \n After all Riever did come, and early, too. It still lacked a few minutes of nine. But he met Pendleton outside, who brought him in, and the two men were closeted in the front drawing-room for awhile. Pen felt by instinct that this interview boded her no good. Afterwards her father came to her in the kitchen saying: \n \n \"Mr. Riever wants to say good-by to you.\" \n \n He avoided Pen\u0027s eye as he said it, and there were complacent little lines about the corners of his mouth. \"Riever has given him more money!\" Pen thought with sinking heart. \n \n Pendleton did not accompany her back to the drawing-room. Riever was waiting for her, carefully dressed in his admirable, square-cut yachting suit. He was brisk, and inclined to be effusive, signs in Pen\u0027s eyes that he was secretly uneasy. But perhaps that was natural. His eyes were as devoid of expression as an animal\u0027s; she could not guess of what he was thinking; his words came merely from his lips. \n \n \"How are you?\" he asked solicitously. \"Ah, pale, I see! Not much sleep perhaps? Well thank God! this nasty business is about over.\" \n \n Pen did not feel that this required any answer. She waited. \n \n \"I said I\u0027d come to see you before I set sail this morning,\" Riever went on briskly—and then came to a somewhat lame pause. \n \n Pen waited in an anxiety that was like a physical pain for him to produce a check-book or a bundle of notes. But he made no such move. There was an awkward silence. Finally he said as if at random: \n \n \"By the way do you know what became of Keesing\u0027s revolver? He\u0027s making a fuss about it.\" \n \n \"I haven\u0027t it,\" said Pen coolly. \n \n \"He said you took it from him,\" Riever said with a light laugh—but his eyes were tormented. \n \n \"He is mistaken,\" said Pen. \"When he fell it flew out of his hand. I don\u0027t know what became of it.\" \n \n \"He said you carried it away in your hand.\" \n \n \"That was the pistol you gave me in the morning ... You saw it,\" she added, feeling pretty sure that Riever had been in no condition to distinguish one pistol from another. \n \n \"Why of course!\" he said. \"It\u0027s absurd.\" But there was no real conviction in his tones. \n \n \"If you\u0027ll wait a moment I\u0027ll get it for you,\" said Pen. \n \n \"Please don\u0027t bother,\" he said. \"Keep it as a souvenir.\" \n \n There was another silence. Pen saw that he dared not accuse her openly. The matter had to be threshed out to a conclusion, so she grasped her nettle firmly. \n \n \"What else did Mr. Keesing tell you?\" she asked scornfully. \n \n Riever\u0027s attempt to carry it off lightly was painful to see. \"Oh, I don\u0027t take any stock in it,\" he said with his laugh. \n \n \"But I ought to know, shouldn\u0027t I?\" \n \n Riever laughed excessively. \"Said you had no intention of giving him up until he surprised you together. Said you were just walking up and down the beach talking.\" His eyes were darting ugly, pained glances at her. \n \n Pen laughed too. \"In the full moonlight!\" she exclaimed. She was secretly relieved. If Keesing had overheard their talk he would of course have repeated it. \n \n \"I told you there was nothing in it,\" said Riever. \n \n \"If I was ... friendly with him, do you think I\u0027m the sort of person to give him up?\" demanded Pen. \n \n \"Certainly not ... But Keesing said after he had recognized Counsell, there was nothing else for you to do.\" \n \n \"If I\u0027d wanted to save the other man I could have shot Keesing,\" said Pen boldly. \n \n Riever stared. \"Well ... I believe you are capable of it,\" he muttered. That at least was honest. \n \n Pen followed up her advantage quickly. \"Obviously a crude attempt to get the reward for himself,\" she said. \n \n \"That\u0027s what I thought ... But Keesing clearly understood that there was nothing in it for him, anyway. He didn\u0027t bring the man in.\" \n \n \"Then it was just spite,\" said Pen. \n \n \"No doubt,\" said Riever. \n \n Pen\u0027s heart sank. She was making no progress whatever. He would agree with everything she said, and act according to his own secret motives. She was determined to drag these out into the light. \n \n \"Well, what are you going to do about it?\" she asked bluntly. \n \n \"Why, nothing!\" he said with an air of surprise. \n \n \"I mean about the money,\" said Pen firmly. \n \n He averted his head. \"What do you want so much money for?\" he muttered. \n \n \"What does anybody want money for?\" said Pen. \"Thousands of things!\" \n \n He came towards her eagerly. \"Tell me what they are,\" he stuttered. \"Anything ... anything money will buy! You have only to name it!\" \n \n \"I can\u0027t take gifts from you,\" said Pen coldly. \"I\u0027ve earned this money, haven\u0027t I? You promised it.\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t go back on my promises,\" he muttered. \n \n \"Well then?\" \n \n \"But just at the moment I haven\u0027t it by me.\" \n \n Pen thought: \"It\u0027s all over!\" And tasted despair. \n \n He went on more glibly: \"One\u0027s money gets all tied up you know. And I\u0027ve been under heavy expenses. Of course I can arrange it when I get back to town. I\u0027ll bring it to you myself. Just as soon as I can get this ugly business off my hands. It won\u0027t take long. Popular opinion demands that the man be tried speedily. And I can set certain influences at work. I fancy the trial will be brief. In six weeks you can expect to see me back again.... And under much happier circumstances I trust. I\u0027m afraid at present you have certain doubts of me. Almost a dislike. This has been such a beastly business! When I come back my whole aim will be to remove your doubts. To show you what I really am. And what you mean to me. Thank God! time is on my side!\" \n \n Pen kept her eyes down to hide the thought she was sure must be speaking through them: \"If you came back here under such circumstances I should kill you!\" \n \n Her stillness frightened him. He began to hedge. \"But what am I saying? You don\u0027t have to wait for your money till I come back. It is a matter I can arrange with my bankers. You may expect a check within a week.\" \n \n Pen was not deceived of course. She foresaw the silky, apologetic letter she would receive at the end of a week—without any check. She was silent. \n \n Riever\u0027s instinct warned him against making any loverly demonstration at such a moment. \"Good-by,\" he said. \n \n Pen\u0027s generous, open nature imperiously demanded that she avow her true feelings, and crush him like the worm he was. It cost her a frightful, silent struggle to keep it in. She kept saying to herself mechanically: \"We haven\u0027t convicted him yet. I must go on deceiving him!\" \n \n Without raising her eyes, she offered him her hand. He carried it lightly to his lips, and quickly left the room. \n \n But how he got out, or what she herself did during the next half hour, Pen could never have told clearly. When she came back to the realization of things it was to find herself kneeling at one of the windows in her room listening to the clank of the yacht\u0027s anchor chain. The sound seemed to be striking on her bare heart. She saw the mud-hook slowly rise out of the water, and the yacht\u0027s screws set up a churning astern. The graceful vessel began to move. She came about in a wide circle and swept out of Pen\u0027s range of vision behind the trees. As she passed the lighthouse she saluted with three blasts of her melodious whistle, and the lighthouse bell tolled in answer. \n \n Somewhere in the bowels of that vessel, in darkness perhaps, and manacled, sat the bright-haired Don, grinning derisively at misfortune. He was depending on her; keeping himself up no doubt with the assurance that she had secured the money to save him ... Pen\u0027s head dropped on her arms. \n \n \n Upon the departure of the yacht, the crowd at Broome\u0027s Point quickly broke up. Slow-moving ox-carts started up the Neck road, and noisy motor-boats put off up the river and across the Bay. Before it was midday the old unbroken peace had descended on the remote estate, and all that had happened in between seemed like a dream. As of old, the fish-hawks plunged for their wriggling prey, buzzards circled high in the blue, hens clucked contentedly at the kitchen door, and the turkeys set up a sudden gobbling in the fields. \n \n Pen could not long give herself up to despair. She must act if she wished to save her sanity. With a tormented face she went about the house in a whirl of activity. Black Aunt Maria\u0027s eyes rolled askance at her mistress. Pendleton remained down on the beach seeing the boats off. Pen suspected he was purposely keeping out of her way. \n \n When he came in to dinner he was affecting an air of busy abstraction. When Pen addressed him he would reply, gently: \n \n \"Don\u0027t interrupt me, my dear, I have an idea just taking shape in my mind.\" \n \n This was an old dodge of his, when he wished to escape something unpleasant. Pen smiled to herself without mirth, and quietly bided her time. \n \n When he was finished eating he attempted to slide out of the room, but Pen was on the watch for that. \n \n \"One moment, father.\" \n \n \"Another time, my dear. I must get this down on paper before it escapes me.\" \n \n Pen put herself determinedly between him and the door. \"Sorry,\" she said. \"But I have some rights as well as your ideas.\" \n \n \"Only an ignorant person sneers at ideas,\" he said loftily. \n \n Pen refused to be drawn aside. She began mildly: \"Now that this business is over, I hope there\u0027s no objection to my going away for a little while.\" \n \n His eyes narrowed and hardened as a weak and stubborn man\u0027s must. \"Why should you go away now?\" he demanded. \"The trouble is over. This is the best place to rest.\" \n \n \"Just the same I must go,\" said Pen. \"Will you give me the money?\" \n \n \"I\u0027ll take you for a visit to Cousin Laura Lee at Frederick,\" he said. \"The trip will do us both good.\" \n \n \"I must have more of a change than that,\" said Pen patiently. \"I need six hundred dollars.\" \n \n \"Preposterous!\" he cried. \"You know I have no such sum to fritter away!\" \n \n \"I have worked for you six years,\" said Pen wistfully. \"A hundred dollars a year does not seem much!\" \n \n \"Oh, if you\u0027re going to measure your duty towards me in dollars and cents!\" \n \n \"But I\u0027m not! I...\" \n \n \"That\u0027s enough. I am your father. I am the best judge of what is right for you.\" \n \n Pen was too sore at heart to be very patient. \"You got more money from Mr. Riever this morning,\" she said at a venture. \n \n There was a significant exchange of glances, startled on his part, quietly assured on hers. He saw that it was useless to deny it. \n \n \"Well, if I did,\" he said with dignity, \"you may be sure it wasn\u0027t a gift. I gave a fair return for it ... Anyway, that\u0027s my capital. I can\u0027t spend it.\" \n \n \"Did you undertake to keep me here for him?\" Pen asked quietly. \n \n By the way he puffed out his cheeks and wagged his head she saw that she had guessed somewhere near the truth. She was unspeakably saddened. Her father! What was the use? \n \n Meanwhile he was noisy in his aggrieved protestations. \"How can you say such a thing! Am I not your father? You must know that every act of mine is solely directed by a concern for your good. My life is devoted to that end.\" \n \n Pen struggled on, though she was convinced of the hopelessness of it. \"I grant that,\" she said. \"Willingly! But you might be mistaken ...\" \n \n \"Never!\" he cried, without any notion of his absurdity. \n \n \"Well, we mustn\u0027t quarrel,\" said Pen. \"I appeal to your affection for me. I seldom ask you for anything. I am not one of the flighty kind. You must see that I am in deadly earnest. I must go away! If I were kept here I should go out of my mind!\" \n \n But cupidity had for the moment overcome his natural affections—as it has a way of doing. \"Pooh! you\u0027re talking like a flighty girl now,\" he said loftily. \"Permit me to be the judge of what is best for you.\" \n \n \"Oh, all right,\" said Pen with a sudden change of tone. \"Let\u0027s say no more about it.\" \n \n Pendleton was a little astonished by his victory, for his case was bad. \"Well, that\u0027s my own girl!\" he said, approaching her full of fine, fatherly approval. \n \n Pen cast an odd, cold glance at him and passed out into the pantry. Pendleton went up-stairs feeling acutely uncomfortable. \n \n During the afternoon they pursued the usual routine. Pen\u0027s first act was to let Doug out of the barn. The good dog was wild with delight. Pendleton went for the mail. \n \n When he came into the house for supper, his eyes sought Pen\u0027s face with a furtive anxiety. All was serene there, and his spirits rose mightily. In all these years Pendleton had learned little about his daughter\u0027s nature. He persisted in believing what he wished to believe. During the meal he was affable and discursive. Pen listened with a sufficient smile, and was as attentive as ever to his wants. \n \n They spent their usual quiet evening under the dining-room lamp, Pen with her mending, Pendleton with his newspaper. An instinct of caution warned him not to read aloud any of the comment on the Counsell case. The news of the grand dénouement had not reached Baltimore in time for that morning\u0027s paper. They retired early, Pen offering her cheek for the usual good-night kiss. \n \n As soon as the sounds of Pendleton\u0027s snores began to issue through the transom over his door, Pen came out of her room again. She was dressed in hat and suit, and carried a small valise. She also had a note addressed to Aunt Maria, giving certain directions for breakfast. As Aunt Maria could not read, Pen knew that it would be brought to Pendleton\u0027s attention early. \n \n She slipped out of the house by the back door. Doug in his kennel whined with pleasure. She unfastened him with an admonition to silence. Doug was too experienced a dog to waste much energy in unnecessary noise. Pen walked swiftly back through the paddock, and through the stable yard gate to the road. Doug ran ahead with his tail high. It was a fair night with a pale sky, and dim stars. \n \n She was too early. She loafed along the road. At the gate to the distant field where the sheep were pastured, she leaned her elbows on the bars waiting for the moon, while Doug pursued his canine investigations far and near. He had all the lost time of his imprisonment to make up. Finally when the silver rim appeared, Pen let down the bars and whistled for him. \n \n \"Fetch them out, sir!\" she said. Doug knew his business thoroughly. \n \n Half an hour later the huddled little flock was striking into the woods, with Pen at its heels and Doug, all intent now upon his charges. Pen paused to let them drink their fill in the little stream that flowed across the road. They plodded on through clogging sand and around mudholes that never dried up from one year\u0027s end to another. There was no regular beat to the thudding little hoofs, for those in the van were always hanging back, and those in the rear running to catch up. They passed along in little gusts of sound, like nervous fingers drumming on a window pane. Pen was choked with dust. \"What will I look like in the morning?\" she thought. \n \n Little owls mourned far off, this way and that, and occasionally the bark of a fox brought Doug to a stand with raised ruff and murmured growl. Through openings in the branches, stray shafts of moonlight fell on the backs of the sheep making them look like little gray ghosts creeping along with bowed shoulders. There was a place miles deep in the woods where they passed a squatter\u0027s shack close beside the road. The nervous patter of hoofs brought a figure to the open door. In a curiously tense pose he watched them pass; transfixed; without a sound. \n \n It was ten miles through the woods to the fork in the road where you took the right-hand-turn down to the wharf at Hungerford\u0027s Run, three miles further. Endless it seemed to Pen, the way the road twisted aimlessly first off in one direction, then back in the other. It was level for the most part except for once or twice when it precipitated them into a gully with a branch over which Pen had to jump. In spite of scurrying hoofs their net progress was slow. Dawn had broken before they came out on the open road. Pen dreading curious eyes urged them on as fast as she could. \n \n She had one encounter. A farmer early at the plow, turned his team at the end of his furrow, just as Pen with her convoy passed in the road below. His jaw dropped; he all but rubbed his eyes at the strange spectacle of a modishly-dressed (to him) young lady covered with dust, driving a flock of sheep miles from anywhere. Pen did not know him, but he, by a process of elimination guessed who she must be. His face expressed a sort of agony of curiosity until the obvious explanation occurred to him, when it cleared. \n \n \"Driving your sheep to the steamboat?\" he said. \n \n \"Yes,\" said Pen, blushing, and looking straight ahead. \n \n He clambered over the fence, and slid down the bank to her side. \"I just put up my clover last week,\" he said in friendly fashion. \"Next field on the left. Drive \u0027em in and let \u0027em crop awhile. You got plenty time.\" \n \n Pen thanked him. He walked beside her, glancing at her from the corners of his eyes. He opened a gate for her, and the grateful sheep scattered inside to their breakfast. \n \n \"You come far?\" he ventured. \n \n Pen nodded. \n \n \"Come through the woods at night alone!\" \n \n \"I had my dog.\" \n \n \"Well it\u0027s more than I would have done. Why didn\u0027t you ride a hoss?\" \n \n \"I\u0027m going up on the boat,\" said Pen. \"Had no way of getting the horse back. The dog can find his own way of course.\" \n \n \"Well, you\u0027re a good plucky young lady, I\u0027ll say ... You\u0027ll find a good spring down at the foot of the slope, yonder. How about some breakfast, I\u0027ll be going home to mine, directly.\" \n \n \"I brought it with me, thank you,\" said Pen, indicating the valise. \n \n With many a backward look he returned to his horses, and Pen was free to wash at the spring, and brush her clothes. \n \n Arriving at the dilapidated wharf a mile or so farther, she had to run a gauntlet of curious stares. Everybody wished to help her, and the sheep were quickly penned and tagged. Pen could see in the men\u0027s eyes what a storm of gossip would break loose once her back was turned, but she cared little about that. \n \n The steamboat on her up trip was due at eight o\u0027clock. Pen\u0027s chief anxiety was lest it should be delayed long enough to allow her father to reach Hungerford\u0027s Run on horseback. Pendleton had no right to stop her of course, and nothing he might say could shake her determination; but she shuddered at the idea of washing the family linen there on the beach before strangers. \n \n However the Princess Anne arrived before her father, and the sheep were driven aboard. Pen put her arms around the good dog\u0027s neck, careless of who might witness her emotion. \n \n \"I can\u0027t take you! I can\u0027t take you!\" she murmured. \"Do not blame me for it!\" \n \n They had to lock Doug in the little warehouse before she could go aboard. Pen listened to him flinging himself against the door, and heard his sharp, anguished barks, feeling like a traitress. \n \n The steamboat proceeded on her leisurely course from wharf to wharf up the bay. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2143/60608.html","bookId":481,"book":{"id":481,"title":"Ramshackle House","description":"简介： Broome\u0027s Point proper is a crescent-shaped spit of sand separating the mouth of the Pocomico River from the waters of Chesapeake Bay.
