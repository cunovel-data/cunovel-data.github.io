{"id":36918,"no":11,"title":"CHAPTER XI PEN\u0027S HAND IS FORCED","content":"It was a justly aggrieved father that Pen found awaiting her in the dining-room. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Half-past eight!\" he said. \"Where on earth have you been!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Pen was quiet and starry-eyed with happiness. It didn\u0027t matter much to her what she said. But she rather wished to avoid a scene. She juggled with the truth a little. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mr. Delehanty wanted me to help him with the search.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Delehanty! ... Wanted you!\" he said amazed. It was too much for him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And Mr. Riever,\" Pen added as an afterthought. \\n\\n \\n\\n The magic name mollified him a little. \"Hum! Ha! ... Well, if Riever knew ... What suddenly started you off on this tack?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I want this business over with!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I confess I fail to understand you!\" he said severely ... \"What help could you give them anyway?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I know the place so well!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Do you mean to say you have been searching the woods ... with all these strangers about?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I had only to raise my voice to bring a dozen to my aid ... Besides, Mr. Riever lent me a revolver.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh! ... Well you might have taken your father into your confidence ... Did you find anything?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n A more perspicacious man might have remarked the little catch of joy with which she said it, but never Pendleton. \"The supper is cold,\" he said fretfully. \"Aunt Maria\u0027s gone home.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Never mind,\" said Pen. Out of the riches in her breast she could spare affection for him, the dear, trying child! She kissed his bald spot. \"I\u0027ll make a cup of tea for myself.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I got the mail this afternoon,\" he grumbled. \"There\u0027s a letter for you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Eh?\" said Pen sharply. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"On your plate. I never saw the handwriting before.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Pen glided swiftly around the table. \"I never saw it either,\" she said. Which was perfectly true. A scrawling, half-formed hand. The post-mark \"New York\" told her all that she needed to know. \\n\\n \\n\\n She thrust it carelessly in her belt and went out into the kitchen. Pendleton looked affronted. He was terribly curious. Pen lit the oil stove and put the kettle on. Then she read her letter. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Dear Miss: \\n\\n \\n\\n I\u0027m not much at writing. Please excuse mistakes. Well Miss Broome I guess you were right, all right. Everything bears out what you said. I and the fellows have made a good beginning, but we haven\u0027t cinched it yet by a good deal. Of course in a job like this you got to be absolutely bomb-proof before you put yourself under fire. I guess you get me. Just at present we\u0027re stalled for the lack of coin. I\u0027ve raised every nickel I could amongst the fellows and it\u0027s all gone flooey. And not a job stirring. We got to have five hundred quick. A thousand would be better. Bring it up yourself. We got to have somebody to stop at a certain swell joint. None of us was able to get by with it. For God\u0027s sake get the money, if you have to purloin your old man\u0027s sock. Everything depends on your turning up with it the next day or so. No need for me to sign this.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n A few minutes later Pendleton entered the kitchen to find Pen leaning against the table in a brown study, the open letter in her hand. The kettle was boiling unheeded. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Who\u0027s your letter from?\" he asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh ... that!\" said Pen with a laugh. She was obliged to extemporize quickly. \"Such an odd thing! Do you remember the little foundling that used to work for the Snellings on the Island? Something has led the child to write to me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Let\u0027s see,\" he said, holding out his hand. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I can\u0027t, Dad. The poor little thing is telling me her troubles.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Humph!\" snorted Pendleton, and passed on out of doors. \\n\\n \\n\\n Pen carried her supper into the dining-room. She sat, abstractedly stirring her cup, and munching a sandwich, while the same phrase ran around and around in her head. \"Got to have five hundred, a thousand would be better!\" Blanche might almost as well have asked her for a million, she thought sighing. Bye and bye Pendleton having finished his chores, came in again. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sit down a minute, Dad,\" she said. \"I want to talk to you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Anticipating something unpleasant, he dropped into a chair grumbling. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"This business has about finished me up,\" said Pen. \"I must get away for awhile.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027re looking particularly well to me,\" he said. \\n\\n \\n\\n She refused to be drawn off. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know what to make of you,\" he went on crossly. \"A while ago you were all for helping in the search.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I hoped to end it,\" said Pen. \"But I was unsuccessful.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Pendleton scowled sulkily at the table. \"You know what I want you to do,\" he muttered. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That can wait,\" said Pen cautiously. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You may not get the chance, later.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know that I have the chance now.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, let\u0027s talk plainly!\" Pendleton burst out, but still not meeting her eye. \"This is no time for false delicacy. Anybody could see that Riever wants you. He\u0027s given me to understand in the broadest way that you have only to say the word. Even after the extraordinary way you have acted. You still have a chance. What makes you hold back? You\u0027ve got to marry somebody. Men are all much the same. Marriage is no bed of roses at the best! ... Am I not your father? Would I be advising you to anything that wasn\u0027t for your good? It\u0027s a wonderful chance! a wonderful chance, I tell you! ... And you talk about going away!\" The little man was almost ready to weep. \\n\\n \\n\\n Pen schooled herself to patience. \"If Mr. Riever is really in earnest my going away will not make any difference ... It\u0027s said to be a very good move,\" she added slyly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not where a man like Riever is concerned!\" cried Pendleton. \"He\u0027s accustomed to be courted, to be deferred to. He\u0027d never get over such an affront. He\u0027d pull up anchor and sail away never to return!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Pen thought: \"Ah, if he would!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What was in that letter you got?\" demanded Pendleton. \"Has that got anything to do with it?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Pen was startled. She saw, however, that it was merely a hit in the dark. He had no real suspicion. The best way was to ignore his question as unworthy of being answered. \"Won\u0027t you give me the money?\" she said. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Where am I going to get it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Pen was significantly silent. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"A while ago you would not touch that money with a poker!\" he burst out. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It is not easy to ask for it,\" she murmured. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How much do you want?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Five hundred dollars!\" said Pen with her heart in her mouth. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Five hundred dollars!\" he stormed. \"Five hundred dollars! Why you could go to your Cousin Laura Lee\u0027s and back for twenty!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Wherever I went I would need clothes,\" said Pen. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I offered you money for clothes, and you scorned it!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry now. I have thought better of it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, you have, have you? Well, permit me to remind you that the clothes were to wear here, and not to go away in!\" He started out of the room blustering noisily to cover his retreat. \"Five hundred dollars! To ruin your chances! Never heard of such folly! Never speak to me of this again! Five hundred dollars!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He kept on talking right up-stairs. Pen remained sitting at the table looking at her empty hands. \\n\\n \\n\\n She sat thinking and thinking; stirring the tea which had long ago turned cold. The only possible way she had of raising money was through the sale of her sheep. She had considered that once before. Her father would try to prevent her of course, but she might drive them up the Neck road at night and put them on the steamboat from one of the Bay wharves. But Delehanty\u0027s men were watching the road at a dozen points. \\n\\n \\n\\n In her perplexity Pen felt a great longing to consult with Don. Two heads were better than one, she told herself. Perhaps the truth was she just wanted to be with him. She was thankful she had made an arrangement to communicate. In the ordinary course he could hardly expect a letter from her until the next day, but thinking of his boyish eagerness it seemed quite possible that he might come back that night on the chance of hearing from her. At any rate it was worth trying. \\n\\n \\n\\n She got a scrap of paper and a pencil, and wrote four lines: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I must see you. I\u0027ll put on an old dress and a sun-bonnet and walk on the beach near the lighthouse at eleven. If you don\u0027t get this to-night I\u0027ll come to-morrow night.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Pen put this into the agreed place, and returned to the house, wondering how she would put in the hour and a half that remained before eleven. She determined to watch to see whether he came for the note. So she went up-stairs rather noisily, and came down again very quietly, carrying with her what she needed for her disguise. \\n\\n \\n\\n She took up her position on a chair in the dark kitchen, placed against the wall in such a way that she could look obliquely through the window in the direction of her chicken coop. The moon was not up yet, and it was pitch dark under the tree. She could see nothing, but she was sure no one could visit the spot without her being aware of it. \\n\\n \\n\\n And after all she dozed. She had had little enough sleep of late, and now that the most pressing weight was lifted from her breast, the night laid a finger on her eyelids without her being aware of it. The katydids, the crickets, the distant murmur of the waves on the Bay shore gradually undermined wakefulness. Her head swayed against the wall. \\n\\n \\n\\n She awakened, scarcely knowing she had slept. Somebody was outside. She was electrically conscious of it, though for a moment she could hear nothing. Then a soft, masculine chuckle came out of the dark. There was more than one evidently, for men do not as a rule chuckle when alone. A voice whispered. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Doggone, if it ain\u0027t a coop, fellas! What say to a nice fat pullet for breakfast?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n It suddenly came to her this was Don\u0027s voice, with his exaggerated Maryland drawl. Her heart beat fast. \\n\\n \\n\\n Another voice answered: \"Watch yourself, Jones. Those damn birds \u0027ll raise the dead if you lay hand to them!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"On\u0027y one squawk before I get her neck wrung,\" laughed Don. \"I got the lay of the land. That white-washed fence yonder marks the garden. Run down the rows to the next fence and you\u0027re safe!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n A silence followed. Pen, straining her ears heard, or imagined that she heard the latch softly raised, the door opened, and the little pan softly moved inside. Then Don\u0027s voice again: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"By Golly! It\u0027s empty!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The words were spoken in the conventional tones of disappointment but Pen and none but Pen could hear the thrilling little lift in his voice. She was assured that the note was tight clasped in his hands. The voices moved away. \\n\\n \\n\\n Pen cautiously consulted her watch. It was half-past ten. She must start at once in order to keep her appointment, for she must take a roundabout and difficult way. Pendleton\u0027s snores were resounding through the house, and in the back hall where the light could not betray her out-of-doors, she lit a little lamp and arrayed herself. She had a black cotton servant\u0027s dress that had been designed to fit a more ample figure than hers. She put it on and stuffed it out with old cotton until her own shape was altered beyond recognition. Drawing her hair straight back from her face, she twisted it into a tight knot behind, and pulled the sunbonnet over her head. For the dark it was a sufficiently effective disguise. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was still very dark out of doors. Slipping out of the back door, she made her way to the old paddock behind the house grounds, and gaining the road from here, climbed a fence on the other side and struck across the little triangular field for the woods. It was the way she had gone once before to meet Don. Forcing her way through the undergrowth she gained her own path and so reached the little temple. From this point she struck out a line that would bring her out on the Bay shore. The sound of the waves guided her. When she had gone a little way she began to catch glimpses of the Broome\u0027s Point light between the tree trunks, and that gave her an exact course. \\n\\n \\n\\n But this part of the woods was densely grown up, and it was hard, slow going. She had to feel her way through the tangle, and the thorns scratched her hands and tore her dress. She put her foot into unsuspected holes and came down heavily. It was only a couple of hundred yards, but she could progress but a foot at a time. It seemed as if an age passed before she slid down the steep bank and gained the sand. From around the point she heard six bells sounded melodiously aboard the Alexandra, and broke into a run. The tide was falling, and there was firm hard footing along the water\u0027s edge. \\n\\n \\n\\n The lighthouse stood on its spidery stilts only a hundred feet or so off the beach. As she came close Pen could make out old Weems Locket the keeper, standing on the little gallery that encircled his octagonal house, with a companion. She slowed down. The two were leaning on the rail looking out across the Bay, smoking cigars. Even if they had looked in her direction they could scarcely have seen her, for her black dress was lost against the bushes that bordered the sand. There was a fresh breeze off the water that swallowed sounds. The first narrow edge of a smoky, orange moon was rising out of the Bay. \\n\\n \\n\\n Pen breathed more freely after rounding the point. The old wharf was now about a quarter of a mile in front of her. The natives were camped on the beach on both sides of the wharf, and as she approached Pen could see the fires burning low in front of the tents, but no figures stirring. On board the Alexandra lights still shone from the deckhouse windows. \\n\\n \\n\\n Pen, not daring to go close to the tents, came to a stand about a furlong off. There was no sign of Don. But presently she heard somebody coming from the other direction, the way she had herself come, someone softly whistling a tune. Thinking she must have passed him somehow, she turned eagerly. On this side of the point the rising moon was hidden behind the intervening high ground. A figure emerged out of the murk and Pen instantly perceived that it was not Don. It was too late to escape then. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"A skirt!\" exclaimed a rough, young voice, surprised. \"What are you doing out so late, sister?\" He spread out his arms to bar her way. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Let me by!\" murmured Pen. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Wait a minute! Wait a minute! Let\u0027s have a squint at you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He lit a match with his thumb-nail. Quick as thought Pen blew out the flame. The young fellow laughed. Pen tried to dart by him. He flung out an arm and gathered her in. She struggled in silent desperation. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Young and souple as willow, I swear,\" laughed the man. \"What you got so much clothes on for? ... Gee! you smell as sweet as honeysuck\u0027!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Pen beat his face with her clenched fists. He simply lowered his head laughing, and clung to her. She had a sickening feeling of helplessness, and she dared not call for help. It was all over in half a minute. She heard running footsteps from the direction of the camp, and felt herself suddenly released. \\n\\n \\n\\n The newcomer was Don. \"What\u0027s this?\" he cried with an oath that startled Pen—and charmed her. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hell, I didn\u0027t know it was your propitty, Jones,\" the other man said sullenly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Damn you...!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Pen apprehended a blow about to be given, and as in a flash, the ghastly consequences of a fight there, were revealed to her. She flung her arms around Don, and clung to him without speaking. He understood. He conquered his rage with a groan. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well ... get out!\" he said thickly. \\n\\n \\n\\n The other man melted away into the dark. \\n\\n \\n\\n Pen and Don clung to each other. Of the two the man was the more shaken. Moments passed before he could speak. Then: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh my girl! my girl!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It is nothing,\" Pen said. \"I am not made of glass.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My fault because I was late,\" he groaned. \"I couldn\u0027t get rid of those fellows I was with.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I am safe,\" Pen said. \"Forget about it. I have something to tell you. There is little time.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n They started to walk slowly away from the direction of the camp. Pen repeated Blanche Paglar\u0027s letter to him word for word. It arrested his attention, and he quieted down. When they found themselves drawing too near the lighthouse, they turned and came slowly back, Don straining Pen against his side. \\n\\n \\n\\n When she had described her problem, Don said instantly: \"There\u0027s just one thing to do. You must give me up to Riever and collect the reward.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Pen\u0027s breast contracted sharply. She bitterly blamed herself. Why had she not foreseen that this was what he would say. She couldn\u0027t answer. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How about it?\" he asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I couldn\u0027t!\" she murmured. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But if it\u0027s the best thing to do?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I simply couldn\u0027t!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Listen, dearest, we must think this thing clean through to the end. These people in New York seem to have started something. Well, that being so, this seems to me as good an opportunity as any, for me to come out and put up my fight.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I must find out first how much they\u0027ve learned.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"She says it is not complete. But they\u0027ve started something. They seem to be on the level with us. We must back them up before the trail grows cold.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I could find another way of raising the money.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027d rather use Riever\u0027s money,\" he said dryly. \"I\u0027ve got to stand trial anyhow. It will take a whole lot of money, and I don\u0027t see any other way of raising it. There\u0027d be a sort of poetic justice in making Riever pay the expenses of my trial. But we must act quickly. He\u0027s bound to find out that you and I are working together. Then he\u0027d never pay you the reward.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How could I bring myself to do such a thing!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Wait a minute! Suppose we do nothing, what will happen? Oh, I\u0027m in no particular danger now. In a few days they\u0027ll get sick of this search and give it up. I can see signs of it coming. Well, I can go back to the Eastern shore with the fellows I\u0027m chumming with and get clean away. I\u0027ve a new identity all established. But what then? What sort of a life would I have? I\u0027d be a sort of wandering Jew without a friend in the world, except you, and I wouldn\u0027t dare communicate with you. I\u0027d be one of the miserable floaters that have to do the dirtiest work for the least pay. God! when you are really on the outs of things you\u0027re up against it! You\u0027re at the bottom of a pit with smooth walls!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Wherever you were I would be,\" she whispered. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I wouldn\u0027t take you!\" he said simply. \"Not that! Not unless we could hold our heads up.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How could I do it?\" murmured poor Pen. \"How could I make my lips shape the words?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But if it was I you were doing it for, dearest...?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Slowly pacing up and down cheek to cheek, they endlessly and lovingly disputed the question without being able to come to a conclusion. In their deep preoccupation they became careless. The slab-sided moon rose over the high bank, and shone upon them full, and they gave no heed. \\n\\n \\n\\n The edge of the beach was bordered with the brittle woody bushes that the natives call water-weed. Pen and Don had paused in their pacing, and were standing looking into each other\u0027s faces with their clasped hands between them. Suddenly from behind a clump of bushes immediately alongside them rose the figure of a man. He was silhouetted against the moon with a significant raised arm. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hands up, Counsell! I got you covered!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Don acted like a lightning flash. With a thrust out of his arms he sent Pen reeling backwards. She fell in the sand. At the same instant Don dived low through the bushes and caught the other man around the legs. He measured his length in the sand. It was so quick that he did not even fire. The pistol flew out of his hand. Pen following a blind instinct, scrambled on hands and knees and secured it. \\n\\n \\n\\n Don had flung himself on the other man, and they were struggling furiously and silently in the sand. Don kept on top. When Pen\u0027s eyes were able to distinguish between them, she saw that Don was planted on the other man\u0027s chest, holding one of his arms down with one hand, and pressing his other hand over the man\u0027s mouth. With his free hand the man struck ineffectually up at Don\u0027s body, or tried in vain to pull away the hand that covered his mouth. His legs were thrashing wildly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Something to gag him with,\" panted Don. \\n\\n \\n\\n Pen tore off her sun-bonnet and rolling it up with the strings out handed it over. She sat on the man\u0027s right arm, when Don was obliged to release it. Somehow Don managed to force the twisted roll of cotton between his teeth, and with Pen\u0027s aid, passed the strings under his head and tied the gag with the knots in front. Sepulchral groans issued from beneath it. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Something to tie his hands and feet!\" whispered Don. \\n\\n \\n\\n Pen, anticipating it, already had her apron off. She managed to tear off the band, which with the strings attached, made a useful lashing. Between the two of them they got the struggling man turned over, and finally got his wrists tied behind him. With the rest of the apron they bound his ankles together. Don rolled his coat around the man\u0027s head to stifle his groans, and they stood up and looked anxiously up and down the beach. They were about half way between the lighthouse and the tents. Nothing stirred in either direction. \\n\\n \\n\\n Don looked down at the helpless figure. \"Who do you suppose it is?\" he asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Keesing, one of the detectives,\" said Pen. \"I recognized his voice. He must have followed me down here ... But I don\u0027t see how he could.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Don shook his head. \"More likely Pardoe—the man you ran into here, told him something and he came snooping around just on a chance. I gave myself away with my own talk.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n They were silent for a moment. Both were thinking of the same thing. \\n\\n \\n\\n Don said: \"Well ... I guess the die is cast for us now.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Pen clasped her hands. \"Oh, Don!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027ve got to march me out on board the yacht quick and give me up.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, Don!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"This fellow will soon wriggle loose. Then the fat will be in the fire. You must see there\u0027s no other way.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She nodded despairingly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Come on,\" said Don. \"... I guess Riever won\u0027t mind being roused up for such a purpose,\" he added grimly. \"Bring the fellow\u0027s gun with you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n They set off down the beach. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"This man will tell Riever that I didn\u0027t intend to bring you in,\" said Pen. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We\u0027ll have to cook up some yarn ... Tell Riever you were bringing me in when this fellow Keesing tried to horn in on the reward.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n There was no sound of waking life about the tents. On the beach in front, all sorts and sizes of skiffs were drawn up. They chose the first one that had oars lying in it. The falling tide had left it high and dry, and it required a strenuous effort on Don\u0027s part to launch it. At the scraping of the bottom on the sand, a voice issued out of the nearest tent: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Who\u0027s that?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n A lean and disheveled shadow appeared in the tent opening. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s Jones,\" said Don lightly. \"Just want to take a lady for a little row.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh all right, Jones. Go as far as you like.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m popular with the gang,\" murmured Don dryly. \\n\\n \\n\\n He only had three hundred yards to row to the yacht. It was one thing to decide resolutely to give himself up, and another thing to put it into practice. He took half a dozen strokes energetically, and then loafed at the oars, gazing hungrily at Pen. \\n\\n \\n\\n Pen suddenly conscious of the absurd figure she must be making, put up her hands and unpinning her hair, shook it about her shoulders. Don drew in his oars, and creeping aft caught up the dark tide and pressed it to his lips. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, why do you do that now?\" he groaned. \"You are so beautiful that way?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Pen caught his head against her breast. \"How can I? How can I? How can I?\" she murmured. \\n\\n \\n\\n Don with a sigh went back to his oars. \\n\\n \\n\\n Pen with a twist or two, put up her hair in more becoming fashion. She began to pull out the various lengths of cotton with which she had stuffed out her bodice, and dropped them overboard. Don, the irrepressible, began to laugh shakily. Pen gasped, and laughed too. They looked at each other and laughed softly until they felt weak. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Is that all?\" asked Don at last. \\n\\n \\n\\n Pen fishing around inside her dress nodded. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, I\u0027m relieved,\" he said. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, but it\u0027s dreadful to laugh now,\" Pen murmured remorsefully. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s the only thing to do,\" said Don simply. \\n\\n \\n\\n He was sober enough when they touched the side of the yacht. He made the skiff\u0027s painter fast to the grating at the foot of the ladder, and stepping out, drew Pen up beside him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Kiss me,\" he whispered. \"Maybe it\u0027ll be the last...!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n A murmur of pain was forced from Pen\u0027s breast. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I mean for a good while,\" he hastily added. \\n\\n \\n\\n They clung together. His face was wet from hers. \\n\\n \\n\\n The sound of a footfall on the deck overhead caused them to draw apart quickly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Take the gun in your hand,\" Don whispered. \\n\\n \\n\\n They went up the ladder, Don in advance. On the deck an astonished watchman faced them. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What do you want?\" he demanded. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I am Miss Broome,\" said Pen. \"I want to see Mr. Riever.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He\u0027s turned in, Miss.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n In order to avoid frightening him unduly, Pen kept the pistol hidden in a fold of her skirt. \"He must be awakened,\" she said. \"It is important.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The watchman, like everybody else on board the yacht, had gathered from watching his master that Pen was a person to be propitiated. \"I\u0027ll tell him,\" he said, and disappeared within the deckhouse. \\n\\n \\n\\n Pen and Don left alone on deck, leaned over the rail and pressing their shoulders together, gazed down at the black water etched with phosphorescence where the little waves lapped against the vessel\u0027s side and rolled back again. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I love you,\" Don whispered. \"Whatever happens, you have made life to me worth living.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Pen caught her breath. \"Ah, don\u0027t speak,\" she murmured. \"Or I sha\u0027n\u0027t ... be able to go through with it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n They groped for each other\u0027s hands. \\n\\n \\n\\n They had not to wait long. They saw Riever coming through the lighted deck saloon before he could see them. The watchman accompanied him, and another man, a sort of valet-bodyguard. Riever was wearing a gorgeous orange and blue flowered dressing-gown. His face looked puffier than by day, but his thin hair was carefully brushed. He had an expression of oddly strained eagerness. \\n\\n \\n\\n As they came through the door, one of the men turned a switch and the deck was flooded with light. Riever\u0027s sharpened gaze flew first to Pen\u0027s face, and from Pen to Don. For a fraction of a second he did not recognize him, but Don grinned, and said coolly: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hello, Ernest!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Then he knew. His face became convulsed. \"Counsell!\" he cried in a high strained voice. He whirled on the watchman. \"Blow your whistle! Rouse the ship!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The shrill, wailing sound pierced the night. \\n\\n \\n\\n Half beside himself Riever cried to Don: \"You fox! I\u0027ve run you to earth at last!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You didn\u0027t,\" said Don, smiling at him steadily. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, you\u0027re caught! You\u0027ve seen the last of the sun. You\u0027re done for!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Doors opened and slammed throughout the yacht. Feet came running. Among the first to arrive was the skipper from his quarters up forward, struggling into his coat as he ran. Pen looked on at it all, strangely detached. She felt as if she were watching the actors in the scene, including herself, from some point outside her body. \\n\\n \\n\\n To each new arrival Riever cried: \"We\u0027ve got Counsell!\" It was almost a scream. \"There he is! Secure him! Put him in the strong room forward of the staterooms. Have an armed guard at the door day and night. If he resists put him in irons!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The skipper and another clapped hands on Don\u0027s shoulders. \\n\\n \\n\\n Don said: \"Take your hands off me, and I\u0027ll go with you quietly.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Surrounded by his creatures, Riever, his face swollen and flaming, walked up close to Don and all but spat on him. He had lost all control of himself. He had forgotten Pen\u0027s presence. \"You grinning blackguard!\" he cried. \"Grin while you can! You won\u0027t be grinning when they lead you out to the chair! And I\u0027ll be there to see it!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Pen turned away her face. She could not be angry at the little man; he was beneath it. She was sickened with disgust. As for Don, he merely drew down the corners of his lips aggravatingly, and drawled: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Be yourself! Be yourself, Ernest! You\u0027re all wet!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n A titter was heard on the outside of the circle. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Take him away!\" Riever cried furiously. \\n\\n \\n\\n Most of the men accompanied the skipper and his prisoner along the deck to the forward companionway. A steward or two was left hanging about the after deck, and a pretty, frightened stewardess, clutching a pink kimono about her. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Get away! Get away—all of you!\" yelled Riever waving his arms. \\n\\n \\n\\n When they were left alone on deck Riever went to Pen where she stood on the same spot in the same position, the pistol hanging limply down. He said thickly: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My darling! Now I know you\u0027re mine!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n A sharp little cry escaped Pen. She had overlooked this possibility. Instinctively her hands went up between them. She did not point the gun at him, but its mere presence in her hand was sufficient to bring him to a stand. She backed slowly to the rail. When she hit against it, she glanced down over her shoulder at the dark water with a curious lightening of the horror in her face. \\n\\n \\n\\n That glance overboard was not lost on Riever. He looked at her, scowling and pulling at his lip. Lest he should hear what would be intolerable to his self-love, he made haste to furnish reasons for her conduct. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Of course ... you\u0027re all upset!\" he muttered. \"It\u0027s natural after such a strain ... I understand...\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Pen was suddenly overcome by weakness. The gun clattered to the deck. She staggered to the nearest deck-chair and sank into it. \\n\\n \\n\\n Riever called sharply: \"Carter!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The pink-clad stewardess appeared miraculously in the cabin doorway. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Miss Broome is faint,\" said Riever. \"Get smelling-salts!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Pen wanted to keep the girl out on deck. \"Wait!\" she said weakly. \"I\u0027m not going to faint. I want nothing ... I only want to go home.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Riever bent over her. She closed her eyes to avoid seeing him. \"Of course that\u0027s what you want,\" he murmured. \"I\u0027ll take you just as quick as I can dress.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Pen did not protest, because by this time she had regained sufficient self-possession to realize that, until this man had fulfilled his promise to her, she must not rebuff him too much, though she did indeed almost faint with horror at his nearness. \\n\\n \\n\\n As he left the deck he ordered the girl to stay with Pen. The girl came sidling towards her with an emotion in her face that she could not control. Her eyes were both hard and soft on Pen. In that look Pen saw as clearly as if it had been written on the girl that she was Riever\u0027s mistress, but at that moment the discovery caused her no feeling. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Can I get you anything, Miss?\" the girl asked in a purring tone. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No thank you,\" said Pen. \"You needn\u0027t wait.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She retreated to the deck saloon, where she stood hovering in the doorway, stealing glances at Pen that were diffident, wistful and sneering. \\n\\n \\n\\n Riever came back fully dressed, and attended by various servitors. The speed-boat was brought around to the gangway ladder, and Pen handed in. She had picked up the gun and concealed it within her dress. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That skiff belongs to one of the men in the tents,\" she said pointing. \\n\\n \\n\\n A sailor was told off to row it ashore. \\n\\n \\n\\n They landed on the old wharf, and Riever led her up the hill. To Pen\u0027s relief they were followed a hundred feet or so behind, by a body-guard. Riever had his hand under her elbow. She would not allow herself to object to that, though her flesh crawled at his touch. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You feel better now?\" he murmured. \\n\\n \\n\\n She nodded. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Tell me how it came about.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She had her story ready for him. She cut it as cunningly to the pattern of truth as she could. \"I searched to-day in all the places I knew of, but I found no trace of him. On my way home along the road this evening I saw him returning amongst the other searchers. It seems he joined the searchers some days ago. That\u0027s why you couldn\u0027t find him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What devilish cunning!\" cried Riever. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It was growing dark,\" Pen went on. \"He dropped behind the men he was with, and we had some talk. We couldn\u0027t say much there amongst all those people—I wasn\u0027t going to let them know, so I made an appointment with him to meet me on the beach at eleven, when I supposed everything would have quieted down. He suspected nothing.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, he thinks he\u0027s irresistible!\" sneered Riever. \"... It was dangerous. You should have arranged to have men concealed there.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I wanted to deliver him up to you myself as I said I would.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You are wonderful!\" murmured Riever. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I went armed,\" said Pen. \"And I forced him to come with me. That\u0027s all.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Riever carried her hand to his lips. \"You are a woman in a thousand!\" he cried. \"I never heard of such pluck!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Pen pulled her hand away. \"Please! Please!\" she murmured. \"I can\u0027t stand it! ... Not to-night!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He eagerly snatched at the little promise she held out. \"Ah, I won\u0027t press you,\" he said amorously. \"I know how you must be feeling. Tender-hearted woman and all that. Cuts you all up to have to give up a man to justice. But believe me, he\u0027s a bad one through and through. You\u0027ve done a service to all decent people. You\u0027ll soon see that yourself.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Pen sighed with relief, that he had so ready an explanation of her agitation. \"There\u0027s something else I must tell you,\" she went on. \"As I was bringing Counsell along the beach a man interfered between us. I think it was one of the detectives. I suppose he wanted to share in the reward. Anyhow the two men fought on the beach. I let them fight it out. I helped Counsell because he was my prisoner. And he got the best of the other man and tied him up. I suppose he\u0027s lying there yet. Half way between the wharf and the lighthouse. As soon as it was over I forced Counsell to come along with me just the same as before.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Riever laughed loudly. \"What a woman you are!\" he cried. \"You\u0027ve earned that reward ten times over! Don\u0027t you worry. Nobody else shall touch a cent of it!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n That clear-eyed little familiar inside Pen whispered to her: \"This is all very well, but as soon as he has time to think it over, he\u0027ll begin to see the holes in your story. You must get the money out of him to-night if you can.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n But how could she bring herself to speak of it? \\n\\n \\n\\n They lingered at the door of the big house. The body-guard was waiting off in the drive with his back discreetly turned. Riever took enormous encouragement from the fact that Pen did not try to hurry away from him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What are your plans?\" she murmured. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We\u0027ll weigh anchor early to-morrow,\" Riever said, \"and steam to Annapolis where I will obtain the necessary extradition papers. Then I\u0027ll have Counsell sent North by train. Before nightfall to-morrow he\u0027ll be lodged safe in the Tombs.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The Tombs?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The New York City prison.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Pen blushed crimson in the dark but doggedly forced herself to bring out the words: \"But ... how about ... what you promised me...\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Riever laughed. It had an unpleasant ring, though he probably meant it good-naturedly enough. \"What a funny girl you are! Anxious about your thirty pieces of silver, eh? Don\u0027t worry! I\u0027ll see you in the morning before I go.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Pen was obliged to let it go at that, though it was with a sickening anxiety. \\n\\n \\n\\n Riever\u0027s voice thickened again. \"You\u0027ve quieted down now,\" he murmured. \"You\u0027re not going to let me go like this...\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Pen\u0027s hands went up again, but he caught her roughly to him. He could not reach her face. He pressed a burning kiss on her neck. Pen tore herself away, and ran shudderingly to her room. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2143/60607.html","bookId":481,"book":{"id":481,"title":"Ramshackle House","description":"简介： Broome\u0027s Point proper is a crescent-shaped spit of sand separating the mouth of the Pocomico River from the waters of Chesapeake Bay.
