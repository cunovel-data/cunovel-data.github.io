Lord! but it\u0027s good to have an accelerator under your big toe again! ... This lil\u0027 ole bus is about all I own, Pen!\" \"You\u0027ll soon get a fresh start, now ... You\u0027re driving just as fast as ever!\" \"Sorry! I feel as if that mob was still behind us. Wasn\u0027t it ghastly!\" \"But they were friendly!\" \"Oh, friendly! Three days ago they would just as lief have strung me up to a lamp-post. I could feel it in the court-room.\" \"Well, don\u0027t you suppose it was a feeling that they had been unjust to you that made them cheer so to-day when you appeared?\" \"I hope so. I don\u0027t trust mobs ... Lord! when I came out and saw them massed in the street from curb to curb ... thousands! ... I could feel myself turning pea-green! I had no idea I had become so famous.\" \"They have been reading about nothing else for days.\" \"What a lot of idle people there must be!\" \"I don\u0027t think it\u0027s idleness altogether. But nothing ever happens to them. They only live in the newspapers.\" \"A good many cars followed us out of town. When they saw which way we were heading I suppose they\u0027ll wire the news, and cheering crowds will be waiting for us...\" \"Oh, Don!\" \"I\u0027ll fool \u0027em! I\u0027ll circle around outside Philadelphia and all the big towns.\" \"It\u0027s horribly immoral our running off together in a car.\" \"Oh, what do morals matter after what we\u0027ve been through together! ... We couldn\u0027t get married in New York with that mob at our heels. We can get hitched up wherever we happen to stop I suppose.\" \"You take it coolly!\" \"I take it as a matter of course ... Shouldn\u0027t I?\" \"I don\u0027t want to be rushed into it!\" \"Pen! ... Have you any doubts of me?\" \"No! How can you say such a thing!\" \"Then what is it? ... What brings the tears to your eyes, dearest?\" \"Nothing! ... Only I want to be quiet when I am married! ... I want to be quiet! ... Things are still roaring about me!\" \"Would you like me to take you home first?\" \"No! I don\u0027t want you to leave me!\" \"Look out! You\u0027ll have us in the ditch! ... What is it, dearest? It\u0027s immoral our going away together. But you don\u0027t want to marry me yet. But I mustn\u0027t leave you either!\" \"Oh, don\u0027t expect me to talk reasonably! ... I don\u0027t want to talk ... Marry me whenever you like, but don\u0027t talk about it ... I just want to be quiet ... with you!\" \"Suits me! I\u0027ll bring you to quiet. I know a little place in the Virginia foothills ... Oh, my Pen! ... Look behind us!\" \"Why?\" \"Is there anybody in sight?\" \"No!\" \"I\u0027m going to stop for a moment. Do you realize I haven\u0027t kissed you yet?\" THE END","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2143/60611.html","bookId":481,"book":{"id":481,"title":"Ramshackle House","description":"简介： Broome\u0027s Point proper is a crescent-shaped spit of sand separating the mouth of the Pocomico River from the waters of Chesapeake Bay.
