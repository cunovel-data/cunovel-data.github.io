{"id":36912,"no":5,"title":"CHAPTER V ON BOARD THE ALEXANDRA","content":"Under the awning on the after deck of the Alexandra, Pen was reclining in a luxurious basket chair with her feet crossed on a rest in front of her. Her brow was clear, her lips smiling. To have seen her then, one would never have guessed that she had anything more on her mind than the deliciousness of luxury which she was experiencing for the first time in her life. As a matter of fact being a human, pretty girl she took to it like a cat to cream, but just the same there was a lot hidden behind her seeming open smile. She knew that she looked all right. Poor as they were, in Aunt Maria Pen possessed a laundress, one of a fast-disappearing race, and there was a bloom upon her simple gingham dress that matched the flower-like freshness of herself. It was mid-morning but Pen\u0027s undone chores troubled her not a bit. \n \n The Alexandra had been lying inside Broome\u0027s Point for two days. On the first day Riever had lunched with the Broomes; yesterday he had returned their hospitality. Of the two Pen\u0027s food was undoubtedly better, being fresher than the millionaire\u0027s, but she had tasted with delight all the expensive things she had read about which never came to Southern Maryland: Caviare, petite marmite, paté de fois gras, hothouse grapes, marrons, etc. This morning Riever had insisted on having the Broomes to breakfast on the yacht. \n \n A few feet from Pen the owner of it all was sitting on the wide divan that encircled the stern rail. Pendleton Broome sat beside him, and on the deck between the two men stood a little table bearing coffee cups and a box of such cigars as the elder man had never whiffed before even in dreams. Pendleton was holding forth to Riever in his usual style, while the millionaire listening politely, glanced at Pen out of the corners of his eyes. \n \n The coming of Riever had changed the situation not a little. Riever moved like an unacknowledged monarch. The tale of his wealth compelled men\u0027s homage. In his presence all voices were prone to become silky and backs to bend. Riever like many another monarch despised this homage while he insisted on it. His more intimate creatures therefore were careful to cultivate an offhand, man-to-man air towards their master while they utterly subordinated their souls to his. This just suited him. \n \n Well, Riever being what he was, he had only to drop a suggestion to Delehanty the chief detective to have all surveillance removed from over Pen\u0027s actions. She was now free to come and go as she chose. Of course nothing further had been said of the proposed warrant for her arrest. Delehanty had become as obsequious towards her as he had previously been arrogant. \n \n A curious relation existed between Pen and the millionaire. From the first he had been most courteous, but in the beginning it had been dictated merely by motives of policy. He could see a little further than the clumsy Delehanty, that was all. Pen recognized in him an adversary infinitely more dangerous. But he had changed. The second time she saw him she became aware that she had a power over him. In short he was powerfully attracted. Pen marveled at it. Riever, who presumably had only to pick and choose from among the beauties of the world! But though she could not understand how it had come about, she rejoiced in her power, and had no scruples whatever against using it. \n \n To anyone else beside Pen the explanation would have been obvious enough. It is all very well to buy yourself royally through a world of salable women, but it lays you open to a dangerous weakness. When you meet a woman who is obviously not for sale, you are apt to fall down before her most ignominiously. That was what had happened to Riever. Just because he was so rich Pen had instinctively adopted an independent air towards him that piqued him intolerably. Really independent. Then there was that highly individual charm of hers. And her independence was not indifference. With all his experience Riever had never met a woman like Pen. Or perhaps it would be more correct to say that a woman of Pen\u0027s spirit and transparent honesty had never before taken an interest in the ugly little man. \n \n When she was with Riever it need hardly be said that Pen was not nearly so honest as she seemed. In fact she concealed herself behind her apparent frankness. That is the great advantage of having a naturally honest look. It enables you to lie so well when you have a real need of lying. Since Riever had arrived the two had been almost constantly together, and a sort of subtle duel going on between them. Pen\u0027s object was to encourage him without giving of herself. He was the first man she had ever set out to encourage. It was a sufficiently intoxicating experience for the man. Pen\u0027s blandishments were very different from the sort that Riever had been accustomed to. \n \n As for Pen\u0027s father he had swallowed the lure of luxury, hook, bait and sinker. At this moment buttoned up to the neck in his old Prince Albert he seemed to be perspiring satisfaction. He had come into the sort of life that he regarded as his own. To see him stretch his arm over the stern rail and flick the ash off the expensive cigar with his little finger was a treat. Pendleton Broome was the sort of man who will always be flattered because he asked for it so plainly. It was Riever\u0027s cue to encourage him to the utmost. After his first meeting with the millionaire Pendleton had said to Pen: \n \n \"I find I have not rusted out in my solitude. I can still keep my end up with men of the world. Riever listens to me with the most respectful attention.\" \n \n Pen had smiled to herself without answering. \n \n More had passed between the two men than Pen was as yet aware of. She knew that Riever had promised to look into the matter of the Broome\u0027s Point railway, thus raising her father\u0027s hopes to the skies, but she did not know that Riever had actually purchased half a dozen lots adjacent to the proposed terminal and that the inside pocket of the old Prince Albert was at this moment crackling with greenbacks. \n \n Pendleton was saying self-importantly: \"The original grade of the railway issues from the gully yonder. The plan was to build a long dock straight out to deep water. But there\u0027s a shoal off the gully. My plan would be to have the tracks turn along the shore to a point below the house where they could build all the docks they wanted right into deep water.\" \n \n Riever gave him only as much attention as was needed to keep him going. \"But that would ruin the outlook from your house,\" he suggested idly. \n \n \"Oh, I shall not remain here after the railway comes,\" said Pendleton loftily. \"I\u0027d take an apartment in New York, and perhaps a house in Newport.\" \n \n \"Newport is not what it was,\" remarked Riever. \n \n \"Ah, the vulgar have taken possession I suppose,\" said Pendleton. \"My father had a place there. My childish recollections of it are most pleasant.\" \n \n \"People are scattered all over the map nowadays,\" said Riever. \n \n \"That I presume is due to the introduction of the automobile,\" said Pendleton. He launched into a discussion of automobiles of which he knew nothing. \n \n Riever listening gravely, sent a quizzical glance in Pen\u0027s direction. But Pen was not to be tempted into making common cause with him against her father. She looked blandly ahead of her. \n \n Pendleton himself delivered them from boredom. He had observed Riever\u0027s interest in his daughter and was not without his hopes in that direction too. By and by he rose saying with a self-conscious air: \n \n \"... Er ... I have some important letters to get off this afternoon. If you\u0027d be good enough to put me ashore, Riever. You needn\u0027t hurry, daughter.\" \n \n Under other circumstances Pen would have been deeply affronted by his transparent ruse. But as has been said, in this affair she had no conscience. She allowed it to be seen that she had no intention of moving. \n \n Riever made haste to summon the boat. Pendleton went down the ladder in his absurd three seasons\u0027 straw hat, bobbing his head and waving his hand airily. Towards the sailors his air of mingled condescension and goodfellowship was delicious. \n \n Pen glanced at Riever through her lashes as he returned to her. The little man held himself stiffly in his blue yachting togs and walked with a suggestion of a strut. The greatest tailor in the world could not endow his meager frame with beauty or grace, but it was not to be denied that his wonderfully made clothes lent him a certain distinction. \n \n He patted the cushions of that wonderful divan that encircled the stern. \"Wouldn\u0027t you be more comfortable here?\" \n \n \"Impossible!\" drawled Pen. \n \n \"A cigarette?\" \n \n \"Never learned how,\" she said. \"I\u0027ll make my first trials in private.\" \n \n \"I\u0027ll send you a box.\" \n \n He sat down and feasted his eyes on her openly. \n \n He was no beauty. His face was a little reddened and roughened with incipient erysipelas. Don had said that he and Riever were of the same age, but the millionaire might have been of any age between twenty-five and forty-five; there was no look of youth about him. He was redeemed from insignificance by his assured habit of command. Yet his assurance did not go very deep. Pen had discovered that he might quite easily be put out of countenance, only nobody ever tried it. When he chose as at present, he could be most agreeable, but there was always a pained roll to his eyes, such as may be seen in the eyes of a bad-tempered horse, a look that boded no good to his underlings. \n \n A curious thing was that in their endless conversations Don Counsell was never referred to but in the most casual manner. Each had a secret to guard here. Pen kept her secret better than the man did. Riever wished it to be supposed that he had just happened in at Broome\u0027s Point on his yacht. That his coming at this time had only the slightest connection with the pursuit of Don Counsell, Pen knew better of course. On every hand she gathered evidence that Riever was the head and front of the pursuit. Riever was the secret source of the hideous clamor raised against the man Pen knew to be innocent. Twenty times a day Riever gave himself away to her love-sharpened eyes—but it was not evidence! \n \n Meanwhile they fenced with each other. \n \n \"You should not encourage Dad in his delusions,\" said Pen. \n \n \"You mean about the railway?\" said Riever. \"I could put it through with a nod of my head if I chose.\" \n \n \"But you won\u0027t,\" she said. \n \n \"How do you know I won\u0027t?\" \n \n \"You are so clearly only humoring him.\" \n \n \"Good Heavens!\" he said in mock dismay. \"Do you undertake to read men?\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t undertake it,\" said Pen. \"You can\u0027t help seeing what you see.\" \n \n \"I could put it through,\" he said again, \"if there was sufficient incentive.\" \n \n \"Of course,\" said Pen. And let the matter drop. \n \n He was trying to make her beg for the railway. What most fascinated and provoked him in her was his inability to make her ask him for anything, or take anything from him. Everybody else in the world asked him for things one way or another. \n \n He presently went on: \"That\u0027s the trouble with life to a man like me: I have no particular incentive to do anything.\" \n \n Pen refused to recognize his money. \"Why haven\u0027t you the same incentive as other men?\" she demanded to know. \n \n \"What are men\u0027s principal incentives?\" he parried. \n \n \"Well, love, ambition, the desire to excel other men, I suppose.\" \n \n \"Yes, one could go far for love,\" he said with a sidelong look. \n \n Pen without looking at him was aware of the look. She thought: \"Men are funny! He\u0027s trying to make me philander with him in a crude way, and if I did he\u0027d weary of me immediately!\" \n \n It was Riever\u0027s desire to shine in her eyes that frequently betrayed him. She was not impressed by his wealth; very well, he had to find some way of making himself out a remarkable figure. He presently said with a casual air: \n \n \"How about hate as an incentive?\" \n \n Pen pricked up her ears. She answered as casually as he: \"I always thought of hate as destroying a man instead of nerving him to do things.\" \n \n \"Not at all,\" he said. \"Hate will carry a man as far as love—or farther.\" His feelings got the better of him. He forgot his casual air. \"There\u0027s more in hate than love!\" he went on with glittering eyes. \"Men get tired of loving, but never of hating. There\u0027s more pleasure in hate because you never can entirely possess your lover, but you can destroy your enemy! ... Do I horrify you?\" he asked with a sudden harsh laugh. \n \n \"Not in the least,\" said Pen coolly. \"Nothing of that sort horrifies me, though I might have to make believe to be horrified.\" \n \n \"Not with me,\" he said, showing his yellow teeth. \n \n \"It is comfortable not to have to make pretenses,\" Pen said. That was as near as she could come to philandering. \n \n \"I believe you\u0027d make a good hater,\" he hazarded. \n \n \"Maybe,\" said Pen. \"I\u0027ve never had the experience like you.\" \n \n An instinct of caution occurred to him. \"Oh, you mustn\u0027t take me too literally,\" he said laughing. \"I haven\u0027t anybody to hate at present. But I have the capacity.\" \n \n It was too late. His glittering eyes had reminded Pen of Don\u0027s phrase: a poisonous look. It was precious evidence to her heart, but unfortunately not the sort of evidence she could take into court. \n \n She was reluctant to drop the subject of hatred. \"The Borgias were good haters,\" she hazarded. \"I lately read a story which told how Alexander Borgia caused a bed to be made for his enemies. It was so arranged that when a body warmed it it killed like a hammer-stroke.\" \n \n \"A fanciful tale,\" said Riever. \"All the killing poisons I ever heard of have to be introduced into the stomach, the blood or the lungs.\" \n \n He spoke as one who knows, and Pen, wondering, pursued the subject with further questions. It was like tapping a hidden spring in the man. With a curious relish he described the action of various poisons on the human system. \n \n \"Cyanide is the neatest,\" he said. \"There\u0027s your hammer-stroke.\" \n \n Pen thought: \"Has he tried that too? ... Collis Dongan was shot!\" \n \n She betrayed nothing in her face, but Riever suddenly, with an uneasy glance, was impelled to explain how he came by so much knowledge. \"You see my hobby is raising fruit,\" he said. \"My peaches have scores of enemies; suckers, chewers, fungi and bacilli. I have to study to keep ahead of them.\" \n \n But he had been talking of the human system! \n \n She couldn\u0027t appear to pin him down of course. She had to let him range where he would, contenting herself with giving the talk a little push this way or that when the opportunity offered. She encouraged him to talk of his childhood and youth, to which he was nothing loath. He unconsciously drew her a picture of a willful, jealous, destructive boy, a little monument of selfishness. There was a bad crack in his nature. He hated beauty, moral and physical, but particularly physical beauty. Pen marked the pained sneer with which his eyes followed the stalwart young steward who carried away the cups. Riever had to have handsome servants to maintain his position, but their comeliness was a perpetual reproach to him. No wonder he had hated Don Counsell from the first, Pen thought. She guessed darkly that Riever was the kind that pursues beautiful women only to hurt them. \n \n He had been telling her with a laugh of the torments to which new boys were subjected in the fashionable school he had attended. One poor little wretch it appeared had been driven by his persecutors to the point of attempting suicide. \n \n \"Weren\u0027t you sorry then?\" asked Pen. \n \n \"No!\" he said. \"I had to go through the mill when I came. It wasn\u0027t my fault that this kid had a soft streak in him. Besides conscience is only another name for weak-mindedness. I made up my mind early that I\u0027d never be sorry for anything I did. A strong man laughs at conscience.\" \n \n Pen thought: \"Funny kind of strength!\" \n \n This was all very well but what good did it do her? They might talk for a month of mornings without her getting any further. And she had not a day to spare. How was she to get facts? The obvious thing would be to bribe his servants, to have his effects searched and so on. This was impossible for Pen. She was ready to despair of ever bridging the chasm between surmise and fact. \n \n The motor-boat which had taken Pendleton ashore, had proceeded on to the Island for the mail. It was now to be seen returning. This was Riever\u0027s own private mail service. On the day of his coming, deciding that the regular mail was too slow, he had instituted a double automobile service between Absolom\u0027s Island and Baltimore. Twice a day by this means he received his letters and the New York papers, particularly the papers. Pen had already marked with what a curious eagerness he awaited the New York papers. \n \n When the mail-bag was brought to him now he said after a momentary hesitation: \n \n \"Put it in the saloon.\" \n \n Pen noted the eager roll of his eyes towards the bag. There was something in there that he desired to see even more than he wished to cultivate her company. With the idea of seeing the thing through, she said carelessly: \n \n \"May I see a New York paper?\" \n \n \"Certainly,\" he said, and had the bag brought back. It was emptied out on the seat beside him. He handed Pen a paper. \n \n She opened it and feigned to read. At first he made believe to ignore the balance of the contents of the bag, and sat there as if awaiting her pleasure. But he was uneasy. His feet moved; his hands twitched. Finally as Pen showed no signs of losing interest in her sheet, he picked up another paper and opened it with hands that trembled a little. \n \n Pen found that she could not watch him from where she sat. He held his paper up between them. She lowered hers and rose. He was all attention. \n \n \"This hasn\u0027t got what I want?\" she said. \"May I see another?\" \n \n Without waiting for him to hand it to her she picked up another paper and seated herself on the divan with only the mail matter between them. From this point of vantage she could watch him very well without appearing to. \n \n He glanced over his sheet and she over hers. \"Glancing,\" however, does not convey the strained intentness with which he was searching the news columns. Pen observed at once that it was not the Counsell case that interested him. That still occupied the most prominent position on the first page but his eyes merely skated over it. It was something else he was looking for. He turned the page and his intent eyes traveled it column by column. \n \n On the third page they came to a stop. Pen saw his grasp tighten on the paper until the edges of his thumb nails turned white. A little knot of muscle stood out on his jaw. Unfortunately Pen could not see his eyes, but from the extraordinary tenseness of his attitude she guessed the look in them. Whatever it was he read it was brief. He relaxed; a long breath escaped him. He let the paper fall and turned to Pen. There was a new brightness in his face. Certain lines of anxiety were smoothed out. Cynical satisfaction was writ large there. He all but laughed in his relief. He made no further pretense of reading the paper, but lit a fresh cigar and cocking it up between his lips puffed away like a man well pleased with the world. \n \n As well as she could Pen had marked in her mind the spot on the third page where his glance had rested. It was the New York Courier he was reading. She had to be careful not to betray her hand. She made believe to go on searching through the paper she had. Finally she let it fall. \n \n \"It\u0027s not here either,\" she said. \n \n \"What\u0027s that?\" asked Riever comfortably. \n \n \"One of the New York papers has a fashion department they call \u0027A Daily Hint from Paris\u0027. But I don\u0027t know which one it is.\" \n \n \"Can\u0027t say that I ever noticed it myself,\" said Riever grinning. \"But try the Courier.\" \n \n This was more than she had dared hope for. She took the paper from him in a hand that she forced to be steady. For awhile she turned the pages in the haphazard way that one searches through a strange newspaper. Riever meanwhile was sitting beside her regarding his cigar with half closed eyes, and making a little humming sound between his teeth. Clearly he was intent upon thoughts that were miles away from her. \n \n Pen ventured to let her gaze rest on the third page. The make-up of that page, news and advertisements, was such that she had little difficulty in picking out what she was looking for. There was but the one short item of news near the bottom of the page in the middle column. This is what Pen read: \n \n EAST-SIDE GANGSTER MISSING \n \n \"A girl who gave her name as Blanche Paglar of —— Elizabeth St., became hysterical at police headquarters this morning upon being informed by the police that there was no clue to the disappearance of Henry, alias Spike Talley, 24, same address. The girl had previously reported that Talley had been missing since the night of May 27th. She received scant sympathy from the police who told her that if the young man had met with foul play it was probably in the pursuit of his own nefarious occupations. Spike Talley was a leading member of the notorious Chick Murphy gang, and is suspected of complicity in half a dozen crimes of violence.\" \n \n Pen turned a little giddy. Her heart pounded so that she thought Riever must hear it. Dared she credit what this story implied? Had she come upon the key to the whole mystery? Had she? Had she? She leaned back in the divan and held the paper up in front of her so that he could not see her face. \n \n When her breast quieted down she sternly reminded herself that this was but slim evidence on which to build a case. She might be mistaken altogether. She might be merely reading into the item what she desired to find there. She determined to put it to the test. But she had to wait awhile before she dared trust her voice. \n \n It was Riever who said at last coaxingly: \"Put down the paper.\" \n \n Pen did so. Her face was perfectly composed now. Her voice even as she said: \"Here\u0027s a curious little story.\" \n \n \"What\u0027s that?\" said Riever. \n \n \"A girl goes to the police for help in finding her lover. They laugh at her because he was a gangster.\" \n \n For an instant Riever looked at her like an animal at bay, his teeth showing, his eyes senseless with terror. It was gone in a snap of the fingers, but it was enough. \n \n \"I guess that\u0027s common enough,\" he said with a laugh. \n \n \"What a situation for a story,\" said Pen. \n \n \"Oh yes, if you like that sort of story,\" he said, flicking the ash off his cigar. \n \n Pen said to herself with a swelling breast: \"I have made a beginning!\" No need for her to secure the paper. Those names and that address were etched on her brain. \n \n Riever\u0027s start of terror had been due to a reflex action of which he was scarcely conscious. He did not suspect that he had betrayed himself. He must have argued that it was impossible that Pen should connect him with that item in the paper. Her speaking of it could only have been a coincidence. So his satisfaction was undisturbed. They talked on about all sorts of things. But Pen was wild to get into action now. \n \n Her opportunity came when one of Riever\u0027s men came to ask if he had any orders for the boat. It was returning to the Island to get the regular mail which arrived about noon. \n \n Pen said to Riever: \"This would be a good chance for me to get my shopping done. If I might...\" \n \n \"Certainly,\" said Riever. \"If you must. May I come too?\" \n \n This was awkward. It could not be evaded though. \"It\u0027s your boat,\" said Pen, smiling. \n \n \"Yours for this trip.\" \n \n \"Charmed to have you,\" said Pen. \"... But you can\u0027t look over my shoulder when I\u0027m making my poor little purchases.\" \n \n \"I\u0027ll wait in the boat for you.\" \n \n The slim mahogany tender which lay alongside had cost as much as many a well-to-do man\u0027s cruiser. Nothing like her had ever cleaved the waters of the Pocomico. She had the speed of a railway train. Pen was handed in to a little sheltered nook in the stern. Riever sank down beside her and they were off with a leap, throwing a wall of water back from either side of the bow. \n \n But Pen was oblivious to their passage. Her glance was far withdrawn. \n \n \"What are you thinking about?\" asked Riever. \n \n \"My shopping,\" she answered instantly. \"It\u0027s quite a problem. There\u0027s so little to choose from in the Island stores.\" \n \n \"Wouldn\u0027t you like to go up to Baltimore for a day?\" he asked. \n \n This was what Pen had been angling for. \"I might like it,\" she said, \"but...\" she finished with a shrug. \n \n \"Well, there are the cars running up and down empty every day. Why not go up Monday morning?\" \n \n \"Monday is wash-day,\" said Pen. \n \n \"Tuesday, then.\" \n \n Pen considered. \"All right,\" she said. \"I would like to go on Tuesday.\" \n \n \"That\u0027s settled then.\" \n \n Pen saw from his look that he meant to come with her. That was to be expected. She must adjust her plans accordingly. \n \n In three minutes they were at the wharf in front of the store. It was like magic. The Pee Bee took a good twenty minutes to do it. Pen stepped out, a sailor was sent up to the Post-office, and Riever remained in the boat, a target for curious stares. He hated to be stared at, and he presently gave the word for the tender to wait out in the stream. \n \n The store was a rambling structure added to from time to time as business increased. The clerks were engaged in a continual marathon from one distant shelf to another. The three young men contended for the privilege of waiting on Pen, who was a prime favorite even with the touchy Island people who by turns resented and laughed at her father. Pen was entirely unaffected and friendly, quite unconscious of her own reserve. In short she kept alive a fine old tradition of gentility. She was \"Pen\" to the three youths and they were \"George\" and \"Stanley\" and \"Roy\" to her, yet a gulf separated them. \n \n In order to keep up her role of shopper Pen was obliged to purchase a chip basket which she did not want, and a number of articles which she could use of course, but which she had not intended to get that morning. Her purpose in coming to the Island was to send off a letter. She could not write it in the post-office because the sailor from the Alexandra was waiting there, so she bought paper and envelope in the store and wrote it on the counter. \n \n She had been revolving the opening sentences on her way over. So concentrated was she upon her task that the bustle, the running to and fro in the store disturbed her not a whit. Through the open door she could see the mahogany tender floating out in the creek with Riever sitting in his place smoking one of the endless succession of cigars, and she knew she was safe from interruption in that direction. \n \n \n \"Dear Blanche Paglar: \n \n \"I read in the New York Courier this morning of your search for Spike Talley. Perhaps I can give you a clue. I cannot hold out any hope to you that he is still alive, but anyway I suppose it would be a relief to you to learn the truth. But I don\u0027t want to deceive you. I am sure of nothing yet. I have only a suspicion. I thought if we could put what little I know with what you know we might clear up the whole thing.\" \n \n \n Having written this much Pen paused and reread it with a frown. It sounded too cut and dried. She wished to win this unknown girl\u0027s heart. It was nothing to Pen at that moment that Blanche had loved a gangster and was perhaps herself a criminal. All Pen considered was that Blanche had lost her lover, and that Pen\u0027s own lover was in terrible danger. That made them sisters. She continued, from the heart: \n \n \n \"I am a girl like yourself. I understand much that was not written in the paper. Like yourself I love somebody who is threatened by a worse fate than that which I suppose may have overtaken your friend. And at the hands of the same man. We ought to be friends. We ought to help one another.\" \n \n \n Pen\u0027s eyelids prickled as she wrote this. She forced down the emotion, and continued more soberly: \n \n \n \"I dare not write all I suspect to one who is still a stranger to me. Will you meet me in Baltimore on Tuesday at noon? I shall be waiting for you in front of the notion counter in Douglas\u0027 department store. Anybody will direct you to it. I don\u0027t know what you look like of course, but you may recognize me by a blue silk turban stitched with red. My hair and eyes are dark. You may take a good look at me before you make yourself known, and decide if I look like a person who can be trusted. Don\u0027t speak to me if I am not alone. Even if I am alone I may be watched, and it would be better for you to greet me like an old friend. I will enclose a post-office order for fifteen dollars to pay your fare to Baltimore and back.\" \n \n \n Pen was afraid to put her name to this. She hated anonymity, and realized that it would raise a justifiable suspicion in the other girl\u0027s breast, but within the past few days the newspapers had made the name of Pendleton Broome almost as famous as that of Donald Counsell. How could she take the risk? Suppose her letter ended in the newspapers? She turned hot and cold at the thought. Even the post-mark Absolom\u0027s Island would give too much away. But she had to take that chance. She couldn\u0027t put down a false name either. She finally signed her letter: \"Your Would-be Friend.\" \n \n When she finally held her letter enclosed, and addressed in her hand, her heart failed her for a moment. \"It will only arouse her suspicions,\" she thought. \"She\u0027ll never come!\" Pen steeled her resolution. \"In that case I\u0027ll go to her!\" \n \n Pen got a blank check from one of the clerks, filled it out and cashed it. There went her chance of the new hat she needed so badly. Leaving her purchases in the store for the moment she went on up the road to the post-office. The store looked out over the waters of Back Creek. You went up a little rise and found yourself looking out over the river from the other side of the Island. The post-office stood on the corner where the road turned up-stream. It was only a couple of hundred yards from the store but outside the range of Riever\u0027s vision from the tender. \n \n The mail bus had just arrived and a certain proportion of the Islanders were hanging about outside the little building, waiting for the distribution. During this interval the door was always locked but Pen enjoyed privileges there. She knocked, and the post-master, Sammy Cupples, seeing who it was, made haste to open. \n \n She made out her application for the money-order at the little desk in the corner, and Sammy paused long enough in the work of distribution to issue it, so that it might get in that day\u0027s mail. The bus went back immediately. It would reach Baltimore some time before night, and the letter would be delivered in New York the first thing Monday morning.
