{"id":36917,"no":10,"title":"CHAPTER X DAYS OF SUSPENSE","content":"\n Pen lay on her bed wide-eyed and dry-eyed until near dawn. It did not lessen her misery any that a good part of it was anger at having her will balked. She accused Don by turn of callousness, of ingratitude, of folly; she tried to tell herself that he was not worth saving, but without abating any of her torments of anxiety as to his fate. It was worse than anxiety; she had a horrible, dull certainty that he would be taken as soon as it became light. Like a wilful child intent only upon having his own way, he had run blindly out into their trap. \n \n After the briefest period of unconsciousness she was awakened by a stir outside the house. Looking out of the window she saw that the sun was but just up, the great square shadow of the house reached almost to the edge of the bank. Nevertheless early as it was, the house grounds were full of people, and more were arriving through the gates. These were Islanders, fisher-folk, or men from the farms in earth-colored garments. Under the bank she could hear the put-put of arriving motor-boats. Among the people the gross figure of Delehanty was conspicuous, moving about, picking out men here and there. \n \n Well, if he was still looking for men Don was not yet caught, nevertheless, Pen\u0027s heart sickened at the sight. It was clear enough what was happening. During the last few days popular interest in the chase had fallen off, but the news of the finding of the canoe had revived it. The blood lust was aroused again. When she got down to the kitchen Pen learned from the excited negroes that Riever had increased the reward to ten thousand dollars. That was what had brought the crowd. \n \n Like a woman who had died and whose body was condemned to drag on, Pen started things going in the kitchen and set the table for breakfast. When her father came into the dining-room even he who noticed so little, was struck by the contrast of her present look with the laughing m?nad who had thrust him into his room the night before. \n \n \"What\u0027s the matter?\" he asked sharply. \n \n Pen shrugged. She had to make some excuse. \"Last night was too much for me,\" she muttered. \n \n \"I thought so!\" he said severely. \"I told you you were acting wildly ... Riever had nothing to do with that affair,\" he added irrelevantly. \n \n \"What difference does it make?\" \n \n Pendleton had already been out of doors, and he could talk about nothing but the latest developments of the case. In his new interest, his resentment against Delehanty had cooled. Pen could not gather from his talk what they were saying about her. No doubt they spared his feelings—or mocked him without his being aware of it. With the curious blindness that was characteristic of him, he had not yet connected the finding of the canoe with his daughter. \n \n \"How strange that Counsell should have come back here after having paddled away!\" he said. \"And yet, how natural! It was the last thing anyone would suppose that he would do!\" \n \n Pen let him run on, half attending. \n \n Worse was in store for her. Her father said: \n \n \"Of course Riever has been entirely discreet in making his new announcement. He had it written out and sent it over to the Island last night to be posted up outside the store. His offer reads: \u0027Ten thousand dollars for the apprehension of Donald Counsell.\u0027 But everybody understands that it means dead or alive. Many of the men are armed.\" \n \n Pen thought she had experienced the extremity of torment. But this was saving for her. She half rose from her chair with a face of horror, and dropped back again. \n \n \"But this is murder!\" she gasped. \n \n \"Eh?\" said little Pendleton blinking. \n \n \"Cold-blooded murder! ... Cynical murder! ... To set an armed mob after a defenseless man ... with the promise of reward!\" \n \n \"But he\u0027s desperate. If he\u0027s cornered he\u0027ll fight...\" \n \n \"He is unarmed!\" said Pen. \n \n Her father\u0027s jaw dropped. \"How do you know?\" \n \n She saw that she had betrayed herself, but she was beyond caring. Pushing her chair back she went to the mantel and resting her arms upon it dropped her head on them. \"Oh God! what sort of a world is it where such things are possible!\" she cried. \n \n \"Pen, what am I to think from this?\" he stammered aghast. \n \n She could not be still in her agony. She paced up and down stretching up her arms for the ease to her breast which was not to be had. \"Whatever you like!\" she said. \n \n \"You have been seeing him? You know where he is?\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t know now.\" \n \n \"My God!\" \n \n Pen hurried from the room, leaving him in a state of collapse. \n \n She still went about her daily tasks like a piece of mechanism. She had to keep in some sort of motion. She experienced strange lapses, discovered herself offering whole corn in her hand to the newly-hatched chicks; came to to find herself in places without any notion of what she had come for. Her father kept out of her way. \n \n It took a long time to organize the searchers. Delehanty was not taking any chance of failure. He was in no particular hurry since he had already sent a large party by boat to the head of the creek to cut off any escape up the Neck. Finally about ten o\u0027clock the rest were ready. They set off in three parties, the first making its way along the river shore to comb the woods on the Absolom\u0027s Island side; the second setting off towards the lighthouse to surround the pond in the woods; the third and largest party heading straight back by the Neck road. Their instructions were to deploy along the edge of the woods, and wait until they got in touch with the parties on either flank. Two lads who brought motor-cycles over from the Island were delegated to act as messengers between Delehanty and the searchers. \n \n When they had gone an ominous Sabbath quiet descended on Broome\u0027s Point, which was harder to bear than the confusion. Delehanty went off to the cottage. There was no one to be seen but a few of the yellow-faced squatters\u0027 women from up the Neck who peered from under their sun-bonnets with shy, half-human eyes, and a group of old men standing by the porch discussing bygone murders with zest. \n \n Later, Pen came upon her father in the back kitchen, or dairy, evidently seeking to waylay her. He seemed not greatly affected by the scene in the dining-room, only for a hang-dog air, and a difficulty in meeting her glance. As a matter of fact Pen\u0027s tragic eyes intimidated him. For himself, he had been absorbed in trifles for so long that he could not feel anything very deeply. \n \n He said: \"I suppose you\u0027ve forgotten that we were to lunch on the yacht to-day.\" \n \n Pen stared at him. Still he had not understood! \n \n \"I suppose you don\u0027t want to go,\" he said quickly. \n \n \"No,\" said Pen. \n \n \"What will Mr. Riever think,\" he said plaintively. \n \n \"I don\u0027t care.\" \n \n The gathering storm on her brows warned him not to go any further. But he still hung around like a child. \n \n To get rid of him Pen said: \"Why don\u0027t you go?\" \n \n He brightened. \"Well, I wasn\u0027t sure if it was proper...\" \n \n \"Oh go ahead! Tell him I\u0027m sick. Tell him anything you like.\" \n \n \"Well I will if you think it\u0027s all right. I want to talk business with him anyway.\" \n \n He donned the old frock coat and the comical, flat straw hat and set off as blithely as a child with a penny in its hand. Pen\u0027s glance after him was bitter. Nevertheless she was thankful to be rid of him. \n \n There came a time when Pen could no longer keep up even the pretense of doing her chores. Always with her mind\u0027s eyes she was following the searchers. They had come to the edge of the woods. They were spreading out. They were waiting until the parties on either side came up. Now they had climbed the fence and were advancing slowly with their guns held ready; ignorant, passionate men with their guns cocked! She went to her room and paced up and down with her clenched hands pressed to her breast. She could not stay there either. She came down on the porch where she could hear better and paced endlessly up and down, careless of who might be a witness to her agitation. All her faculties were concentrated on hearing. She was listening for shots. \n \n Time passed and there was no news. She sent Ellick, the more intelligent of Aunt Maria\u0027s sons down to the beach to pick up what he could. One or two negroes had come over in the boats. This was regarded as a white man\u0027s business and they were not allowed to take part in it. Nothing transpired until mid-afternoon when Ellick came back to say that the motorcycle boys had brought in Counsell\u0027s camping outfit which had been found in the woods. Of Counsell himself there was no word. \n \n A wild hope arose in Pen\u0027s breast. Suppose after all he had succeeded in getting away up the Neck before the line was drawn across it! \n \n Her hope soon sickened though. What good if he had escaped for the moment? There was but the one road eighty miles long, by which he could reach cities and crowds and safety. And by this time everybody along that road was on the qui vive to catch him, their mouths watering at the ten thousand dollar reward. What chance had he of succor? Where could he get food? Or on that sandy peninsula, water? \n \n She tormented her brain with futile calculations. Could he or could he not have made it? Delehanty had dispatched the party up the creek immediately after searching the house. Pen had heard the boats set off. By that time Don had had half an hour\u0027s start. A man walks perhaps four miles an hour, the boats averaged seven. It was four miles to the head of the creek, and but a step from the landing to the Neck road. Still Don ought to have got there first. But he might have turned aside to get something from his hidden store in the woods! Pen\u0027s brain whirled dizzily. \n \n At other times she pictured him crouching white-faced in the bush, listening to the relentless slow approach of the searchers, and knowing that the other side was watched too. Then the dash for freedom, the shots ... That picture came back again and again. She could not shut it out. How gladly she would have heard the news that he had been brought in—unhurt. \n \n At five o\u0027clock she beheld her father turning in at the gate accompanied by Riever. At the sight of the latter Pen saw red. Hideous little creature lunching on his fine yacht while his dollars sent men into the woods to murder! And now to come strutting ashore for an afternoon stroll with his expensive cigar cocked between his lips! How dared he present himself to her! Her impulse was to project herself down off the porch and tell him! But a last strand of prudence held. She went to her room instead. \n \n There she struggled with her feelings. Five o\u0027clock! Faint though it might be, there was a real chance that Don had escaped. She must therefore go on fighting for him. And in order to fight for him effectually she must maintain some sort of relations with his loathsome enemy. \n \n There was a knock on her door, and her father said timidly: \"Mr. Riever is down stairs, my dear.\" \n \n Pen answered composedly: \"Very well. I\u0027ll be down directly.\" \n \n Pendleton was delighted. \"Thank you, daughter,\" he purred. \n \n It induced a fresh access of anger in Pen. He had nothing to thank her for! \n \n Pendleton pattered happily down-stairs. Pen washed and dressed, never ceasing to admonish herself, and in the end achieved a fair measure of self-command, though her nerves were in bad shape. \n \n Riever was waiting with a certain air of bravado. Only an involuntary roll to his eyes betrayed the dark passions that ate him. She greeted him calmly. He looked secretly relieved. \n \n \"I scarcely expected to see you,\" he said smoothly. \"I just came to enquire how you are.\" \n \n \"I\u0027m all right,\" said Pen. \n \n \"And to express my indignation at what happened last night. Delehanty certainly goes beyond all bounds! When I get back to New York I shall talk to the Commissioner about it!\" \n \n \"Oh, the man must do his work,\" said Pen. \"Surely, he doesn\u0027t expect me to be taken in by this palaver!\" she thought. \n \n \"He\u0027s supposed to exercise some discretion ... You\u0027re really all right again?\" \n \n \"Quite all right.\" \n \n \"I\u0027m so glad!\" \n \n It came to her that he didn\u0027t expect her to be taken in. He was satisfied if she would only appear to be taken in. For different reasons he was just as anxious to maintain relations as she was. He just wanted everything unpleasant covered up. That was the spoiled child of it. Pen thought: \"I believe he\u0027d actually marry me without inquiring into my feelings.\" Well, it made it easier for her. \n \n Pendleton made some transparent excuse to leave the room. Riever\u0027s shifty eyes gave a roll of terror, thinking that perhaps Pen might now insist on dragging the truth into the light. \n \n Pen however only said: \"I\u0027m surprised to see you on foot this afternoon.\" \n \n His face turned smug again. \"I like walking,\" he said. \"It\u0027s my ridiculous people that insist on having me carried every step.\" \n \n \"Do you walk much in New York?\" asked Pen. \n \n He was flattered by her interest. \"Yes, very much,\" he said. \n \n \"But I forget, you don\u0027t live in the city, do you?\" \n \n \"Sometimes.\" \n \n \"Have you a home there, too?\" \n \n \"Well, not exactly a home, but a very pleasant little lodging.\" \n \n \"Ah, an apartment.\" \n \n \"No, I detest apartments. One always feels as if the hall servants were spying on your comings and goings.\" \n \n \"You stay at your club then?\" \n \n \"No, clubs are all very well in their way, but I\u0027m not a clubby person. I like to spread about among my own things. In a club too, the servants are always under your feet. In New York I like to get away from servants altogether. I am not so dependent on them as you seem to think.\" \n \n Pen\u0027s heart began to beat a little thickly. \"And have you such a place?\" she asked with interest. Apparently they were back just where they had been before the violent scene of the previous night. \n \n \"Yes.\" \n \n \"Do tell me about it.\" \n \n \"It\u0027s a quaint little house in an unfashionable neighborhood. It stands in the name of my valet. The beauty of it is none of my neighbors know me and I can go and come as I please. It\u0027s a petit maison in the French style, a little entresol below, overhead three tall windows lighting the salon, then a receding attic, and that\u0027s all. I don\u0027t suppose there\u0027s another house like it in town.\" \n \n \"And the inside?\" said Pen. \n \n \"A salle a manger on the ground floor looking out on a little formal garden at the back. On the main floor the salon in front and a bedroom in the rear. In the attic, servants rooms. Just a little house for one.... Or two,\" he added with a sidelong glance. \n \n \"How interesting!\" said Pen. \"I\u0027d like to see it.\" \n \n \"I hope you will some day.\" \n \n \"In what part of the town is it?\" asked Pen casually. \n \n \"On Thirty-Ninth Street east of Lexington.\" \n \n Pen lowered her eyes to hide the glint of satisfaction in them. \"This will help Blanche,\" she thought. \"I\u0027ll write it to-night.\" \n \n Presently he rose to go. \"Tell me you will,\" he said. \n \n \"Will what?\" murmured Pen. \n \n \"Come to see my little house some day?\" \n \n \"Nothing is impossible,\" said Pen turning away her head. If he chose to read coquetry in the action, that was his look-out. \n \n He held her hand loverly-wise for a long moment, Pen steeling herself not to shudder. Then he left the room. \n \n Pen began to laugh but there was no sound of mirth in it. She began to laugh and she could not stop again. The tears ran down her face and her whole body was shaken with tearing sobs. She ran to her room. She was horribly unstrung. It was long before she could get hold of herself again. \n \n The collapse eased the strain on her nerves. She came down-stairs and was able to resume her usual round of tasks. Time was passing, and still no bad news had been received. Hope grew stronger. Finally word was brought down the road that the search party had joined forces with the line of guards drawn across the Neck, and Don Counsell had not been taken. Pen was able to face the night unafraid. \n \n She presently learned that Delehanty had formed his men into several camps for the night. The automobile was kept busy running up the road with supplies for them. At the same time he was preparing to have the road well patrolled along its whole course through the woods. After dark a fugitive could not travel any distance except by the road. \n \n The night came on muggy and still and Pen was attacked by a fresh anxiety. For clouds of mosquitoes arose. She pictured Don fainting with hunger and thirst, and unable even to make a smudge for fear of betraying himself, vainly attempting to protect himself from the insects. \n \n She had a wild hope that he might be driven back to her. When the house had been searched they had found the open cellar door, and in the morning Delehanty had sent a man to shut the doors and screw them down. Before she went to bed Pen took lantern and screw driver and satisfying herself that she was not watched at the moment, knelt behind the bushes and opened the doors. She also left the way open for Don to return to her room by the route that he knew of. \n \n She went to bed praying that she might awaken to find him kneeling on the floor beside her. She did sleep for awhile, for Nature must have her due, but when she awoke she was still alone. \n \n When she came down-stairs in the morning she heard a new sound that froze her soul, the deep bay of hounds. Theodo\u0027 came into the kitchen, his eyes rolling wildly in an ashy face, to say that a couple of \"man-huntin\u0027 dawgs\" had been brought over from the Eastern shore to be put on Counsell\u0027s tracks. These mythical creatures filled the negro with an extremity of terror. Nothing would tempt him out of doors again. Meanwhile Pen\u0027s collie, Doug, locked up in the barn, hearing these trespassers on his preserve, and he unable to get at them, went frantic with rage. \n \n The bloodhounds were taken to the spot in the woods where Don\u0027s cache had been discovered, and were given the scent from Don\u0027s clothes. They picked up his tracks without difficulty and came back over the fields, giving tongue straight to the cellar door. Delehanty finding it unlocked again, searched the house once more. The dogs were led around the house. Pen observing from within, saw that they picked up the trail again outside the kitchen window. So Don had gone out that way. However they were soon confused amidst the maze of tracks that tramped down the house grounds in every direction. Again and again their guardians led them over the ground with no better success. \n \n Meanwhile, Delehanty having made a new disposition of his forces, the search in the woods was resumed. He had more men at his disposal on this day, and a second line of guards was drawn across the Neck higher up. Additional detectives arrived from New York and Baltimore, and these were dispatched by horse and motor to search every cabin within miles. At the same time motor-boats were patrolling all the adjacent shores, so that if the fugitive was forced out on the beach at any point he would instantly be sighted. \n \n Notwithstanding these measures the second day passed like the first with neither sight nor sound of the fugitive. It was believed that he was still in the neighborhood, because the bloodhounds, though they were led far and wide through the woods and up the road, had discovered no tracks leading away from Broome\u0027s Point. \n \n When the morning of the third day broke Pen had reached the point of desperation again. Not for a moment all night had she closed her eyes. She was now convinced that Don was lying exhausted and starving in some hidden spot in the woods. Probably no longer even able to give himself up. For she was sure he would not willingly perish without a fight to clear his name. When she first came out of the house the sight of a pair of buzzards circling high against the blue, turned her faint and sick. \n \n To spend another day of inaction was unthinkable. Madness lay that way. There was no longer any question of helping him to escape. If he was anywhere near he must be found, whatever might come of it. In her extremity Pen went to Delehanty to tell him she was going to take part in the search. \n \n The detective was considerably taken aback. He pushed out his lower lip and glowered at Pen. \"What\u0027s the idea?\" he demanded. \n \n \"I want him found.\" \n \n \"It isn\u0027t so long ago since you wanted to lose him.\" \n \n Pen shrugged. \n \n \"Have you any information?\" he demanded. \n \n \"No. But I know these woods.\" \n \n \"We all know them now,\" said Delehanty dryly. He considered for a moment. \"Come back in half an hour and I\u0027ll talk to you,\" he said brusquely. \n \n Pen supposed that he wanted to consult with Riever. She was in no humor to wait. \n \n \"You forget I don\u0027t have to have your permission to search my own place,\" she said. \"I offer to work with you. If you don\u0027t want me to I\u0027ll go ahead alone.\" She turned to leave. \n \n \"Hold on a minute!\" said the detective, \"you satisfy me that you\u0027re on the square with me, and I\u0027ll work with you fast enough.\" \n \n Pen was able to tell him the truth—without telling him the whole truth. \"It\u0027s very simple,\" she said. \"I don\u0027t want him to starve on the place, that\u0027s all.\" \n \n \"Humph! You\u0027ve lost touch with him, eh?\" said Delehanty. \n \n Pen was silent. It was of little moment to her what they thought so they did not know anything. \n \n \"What\u0027s your plan?\" asked Delehanty. \n \n \"For one thing,\" said Pen, \"the fields have never been searched. I see you send your men up the road every morning. There are hollows in the fields where a man could lie concealed. Some of the fields are growing up with young pine that would afford cover.\" \n \n Delehanty looked at her with unwilling respect. \"Anything else?\" he asked. \n \n \"If he\u0027s in the woods when he heard the searchers approach how easy it would be to climb a tree until they had passed.\" \n \n \"Are you going to search every tree in the woods?\" he asked sarcastically. \n \n \"No,\" said Pen. \n \n \"Will you take a couple of my men along with you?\" \n \n \"No.\" \n \n Delehanty scowled darkly. \n \n \"I shall call him as I go,\" said Pen. \"If he saw or heard others with me he wouldn\u0027t be so likely to answer.\" \n \n \"Suppose you find him and he refuses to give himself up?\" \n \n \"After three days without food he\u0027d hardly be in a position to resist.\" \n \n \"Would you undertake to bring him in?\" \n \n \"You can lend me a revolver if you want. I have none.\" \n \n \"Not on your life!\" sneered Delehanty. \n \n Pen shrugged. She had only mentioned the revolver as a bit of stage business anyway. \n \n \"Go and find him if you want,\" said Delehanty, \"but excuse me from taking any chances of having my gun slipped to him.\" \n \n Pen went back to the house and made up a packet of sandwiches. As she was setting out the second time she ran into Riever coming in by the drive. He had evidently been with Delehanty, and under his forced air of politeness an extraordinary conflict of feelings was suggested; hope, distrust and a gnawing curiosity. He would not speak of what was in his mind, of course. \"Where are you setting out for so busily?\" he asked with a false air of blitheness. \n \n Pen was blunt enough. \"I believe this man is starving somewhere on the place, and I\u0027m going to find him if I can.\" \n \n Riever put on a look of gladness and delight. The guiding rule of his kind is that by assuming a thing to be so you make it so. He therefore assumed that Pen had come over to his side, that the millions had won out, that he and she were now one in sympathy. It need hardly be mentioned though, that his eye still rolled with a hideous doubt. \n \n \"Oh, that\u0027s fine of you!\" he said ... \"But it\u0027s dangerous!\" \n \n \"He wouldn\u0027t hurt me,\" said Pen. \n \n Riever ground his teeth secretly. \"How can you be sure?\" he said with a great air of solicitude. \n \n \"Because I helped him in the beginning. I fed him.\" \n \n \"But you\u0027ve thought better of it now?\" murmured Riever. \n \n \"I\u0027m going to find him if I can.\" \n \n \"I believe you\u0027re out after the reward!\" Riever said, with a ghastly sort of facetiousness. \n \n Pen caught at the suggestion. If she were obliged to bring Don in, the money might make all the difference to them. \"Well, why not?\" she said. \"I could use the money as well as anybody.\" \n \n There was a quality of eagerness in her voice that could hardly have been feigned. For the moment it lulled his doubts. \"There\u0027s nobody I\u0027d rather pay it to,\" he said grinning. \n \n \"You mean that?\" said Pen. \"If I give him up to you, will you pay me the reward?\" \n \n \"If you give him up to me I\u0027ll double it!\" he said meaningly. \n \n \"All right!\" said Pen. \"If I\u0027m successful to-day, I\u0027ll hold you to that.\" She made to walk on. \n \n Riever\u0027s face was full of triumph, but there was still a fear too, another sort of fear. \"Wait a minute,\" he said. \"Suppose you can\u0027t handle him?\" \n \n \"I have no fear of that,\" said Pen. \n \n He slipped his hand in his side pocket. \"Here,\" he said, \"take this.\" He produced an automatic pistol. \"Do you know how to use it?\" \n \n She shook her head. He explained the mechanism. \n \n \"Thanks,\" she said putting it inside her dress, and walked on. \n \n He strutted after her as far as the gates, and stood there watching. She turned into the path behind the cottage, and followed it into the woods. Her idea in making the little temple her starting-point was that Don in need of succor, might haunt the paths they had followed together. \n \n The sun was looking straight into the little glade through the side that opened above the pond, filling the place with a rich yellow light. Between the shadows of the pillars a broad beam lay athwart the inscription of the gravestone, picking out the curly flourishes of the letters that had been sculped with such loving care. Pen was indifferent now to her shadowy brother who lay under the stone. She had not remembered him in many days. Her thoughts were filled by a man of flesh and blood. \n \n \"Don! Don!\" she spoke softly, not expecting any answer there, and not getting any. \n \n She let herself down the bank to the spring around at the left which welled between the roots of a superb white oak that the axe had spared. For a tree which guards a spring is sacred even to a timber scout. Pen had hopes of the spring because it was one of the only two places that Don knew of where fresh water was to be obtained. She searched carefully about it but was not rewarded by finding any tracks. She made a wider circuit of the spot but could not see that the underbrush had been disturbed. \n \n She forced her way slowly through the tangle of thorny creepers and thickly-springing sassafras around the pond to the old wood road. It curved away secretly into the gloom; old, undisturbed, overgrown; Nature had painted in this ancient blemish. Years ago the bed of the road had been packed so hard that even yet nothing would take root there except a mossy growth like fur underfoot. But at either side bushes had taken advantage of the free light to spring up thickly. Now for the most part they met overhead, though there were places where the sun splashed through. \n \n Pen walked slowly, pausing often to softly call Don\u0027s name. Nothing answered her but bird sounds, and the soft chattering of leaves in the high sunlight. No breath stirred down below. She made wide detours through secondary roads, mere cuts through the woods that only a practised eye could follow now. \n \n It was noon when she came out at the edge of the fields. She sat down under the fence to rest, and, from a sense of duty, to eat something. Afterwards she struck clear across the rough, neglected, cleared land to the woods on the other side, then back again, shaping a course that took her through every hollow. Her experience with sheep had taught her the exact lay of the peninsula, how each depression gradually deepened into a gully, running off to some branch on one side or the other. But nowhere did she find what she was looking for. \n \n She spent several hours searching the banks of the little stream that meandered through the woods to the east of the fields. That was where she had sent him to make his camp that night. She found the site of his camp, but no evidences that he had revisited it. There were plenty of tracks in the mud of the stream, for the searchers had passed and re-passed this way, but no voice answered her soft calls. \n \n Finally she struck across the corner of the farthest field, making for the path which went down through the woods to the arm of Back creek, that path they had followed on another night, a night of happiness. She thought of the old skiff drawn up on top of the bank, and had a wild hope that he might have launched it and succeeded in making his way down the arm and across the main creek to the mainland. True, the skiff was leaky and rotten, but a desperate man might make it serve for a short voyage. She ran the last part of the way. \n \n The skiff was there, just as before! She dropped down upon it, weary of body and despairing of heart, and burst into tears. \n \n \"Don! Don! Don!\" she called for the last time. \n \n A green heron mocked her with its discordant croak. \n \n The sun was low, and there could be no further searching that day. Pen made her heavy way back through the woods, and across the wide field. As she walked a merciful apathy descended on her. She could suffer no more. Imaginary pictures of Don starving in the woods no longer rose before her mind\u0027s eye. She was conscious only of a ghastly vacuum inside her. Within it a little thought stirred like a snake: \"This can\u0027t go on! If I don\u0027t hear in two or three days more...\" She never completed the thought, but her soul was aware of her intention. \n \n As she was letting down the bars that admitted her to the road, a squad of men straggled by, searchers homeward bound. Pen hung back to let them pass. The business was in the nature of a lark to them; young men relieved for the time being from the tedium of their usual lives, they were talking loud, laughing, jostling each other in the road. They stared at Pen as unabashed as animals, and Pen busied herself with the bars. Nevertheless she was aware that one of them did not stare at her. She looked at him, and was struck first, by his curiously self-conscious air. She looked afresh, rubbed her eyes so to speak, and her heart stood still. \n \n It was Don. \n \n True, his chin was covered with a four days\u0027 growth of reddish stubble, his bare head was touselled and unbrushed, he walked with exactly the same shambling slouch as the others. But it was Don. He had passed her, but the line of his cheek was enough, and the muscular back under the cotton shirt. She recognized the old garments she had herself carried to him. Far from being the starving wreck she had pictured, his cheek was full and ruddy, his whole body notwithstanding the shamble he affected, full of spring. For an instant she thought they had taken him. But that was manifestly ridiculous. He was skylarking with the rest. His whole bearing was that of a leader amongst them. \n \n Pen leaned against the fence post. A welter of emotions seemed to shatter her; joy, incredulity, terror that her wits might be wandering, anger at his careless air of well-being. \n \n Bye and bye she put up the bars mechanically, and started to walk along the road with a dazed air. She could not take in what had happened. Dusk was falling. In a couple of hundred yards a figure stepped out from the shadow of the bordering growth. \n \n \"Pen!\" it whispered. \n \n Her first reaction was to a shaking anger. She was a little beside herself. Stamping her foot in the road she cried in a soft, strained voice: \"You Don! Cutting up like a school-boy in the road! Is that all you have on your mind!\" \n \n He fell back a step in surprise. Then he laughed softly like the boy she accused him of being. \"But Pen ... aren\u0027t you glad?\" \n \n \"Yes, laugh! do!\" she said bitterly. \"It\u0027s nothing to you what I\u0027ve been through these last three days and nights!\" \n \n \"I told you not to worry,\" he said sheepishly. \n \n \"Told me not to worry! What do you think I am?\" \n \n \"There was no way in which I could let you hear from me. I thought you\u0027d understand everything was all right.\" \n \n \"You didn\u0027t care! You didn\u0027t care!\" \n \n He moved close to her. \"Pen dear, don\u0027t quarrel with me! We have only a moment. Even this is risky. There are more men coming along the road.\" \n \n She attempted to push him away. \"Don\u0027t touch me! You\u0027re heartless and unfeeling!\" \n \n Even as she said it she began to sob. She swayed on her feet, and Don flung an arm about her. She clung to him piteously. \n \n \"Oh my darling! my darling! ... Thank God! I have you! ... Don\u0027t pay any attention to what I say. I have suffered so. I was just at the end of my string. If I had not found you soon I ... I ...\" \n \n \"Hush, dearest!\" he murmured, sobered and remorseful. \"You mustn\u0027t say such things. I can\u0027t bear it! ... It\u0027s true I never thought. I had such confidence in your strength.\" \n \n \"I thought you were starving in the woods. I couldn\u0027t eat when I thought you had nothing! I couldn\u0027t sleep, seeing you lying there.\" \n \n \"Hush! Hush!\" he soothed her. \"Everything is all right now. Pull yourself together, dearest. There are stragglers all along the road.\" \n \n Indeed they could now hear footfalls coming along behind them. They started to walk too, Don straining Pen hard against his side. Everybody was traveling the same way. Gradually Pen\u0027s breast quieted down. \n \n \"What does it mean?\" she asked. \n \n \"It means I\u0027m one of the searchers for Don Counsell,\" he said with a chuckle. \"Only place they\u0027d never think of looking for me.\" \n \n She looked at him a little aghast. \n \n \"And I\u0027ve made good in the job, too,\" he went on. \"I\u0027m considered quite a valuable man. Delehanty has put me in charge of a squad.\" \n \n \"Delehanty!\" she gasped. \"Do you mean you have spoken to him?\" \n \n \"Why not? He doesn\u0027t know Don Counsell by sight. None of his men do. The only one who knows me is Riever, and I take damn good care to keep out of his way. Luckily it\u0027s easy. He doesn\u0027t bother with the rough necks. And you can always see him coming a long way off by his gang.\" \n \n \"How did it come about?\" she asked. \n \n \"Most natural thing in the world. My way is different from yours. You plan everything out, and I leave it to the inspiration of the moment. When I tried to get out by the cellar that night I heard a man down there. They had one out on the kitchen porch, too. So I took the screen out of the window on the other side, and dropped to the ground and hid in the shrubbery. I gradually made my way down to the beach. There were some natives camping there, but I was afraid to join them then, so I kept under cover until daylight. In the morning a raft of newcomers arrived from all over, and it was a simple matter to mix amongst them. They didn\u0027t all know each other.\" \n \n \"But you speak differently from these people,\" said Pen. \n \n \"Oh, I kept my mouth shut as much as possible. I gave out that I was Frank Jones from New Jersey, see? That accounted for my Northern speech. I said I was off a coasting schooner. Meanwhile I\u0027ve been practising their lingo, and I can already speak Mar\u0027land at least well enough to deceive Delehanty and the other Northerners. Doggone it honey Ah reckon Ah kin tawk! \u0027Deed, can I! Gemmen, it\u0027s the trewth!\" \n \n Pen laughed down his neck. \n \n \"Every day that passes makes my position more secure,\" he said. \"I\u0027m becoming known. At least Frank Jones is. This crop of saw-tooth is a wonderful disguise.\" \n \n He softly rubbed his chin against her cheek. Pen liked it. \n \n There came a hail from down the road ahead. \"Hey, Jones!\" \n \n They moved apart. Don answered: \"Coming!\" To Pen he said breathlessly: \"How can we meet? ... Oh woman, if you knew how I was hungering for you day and night!\" \n \n \"No! No!\" said Pen. \"Everything\u0027s going so well. We mustn\u0027t take risks ... But we ought to have some way of communicating.\" \n \n \"Name it quick!\" \n \n She considered swiftly. \"... Do you know my fattening-coop under the tree back of the kitchen?\" \n \n \"I can find it.\" \n \n \"There\u0027s a little water-pan inside it. Look under that for a letter.\" \n \n \"All right,\" he laughed. \"If I\u0027m pinched for swiping chickens you\u0027ll have to clear me!\" \n \n He ran down the road. Pen followed at a sober pace—still a little dazed. \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2143/60606.html","bookId":481,"book":{"id":481,"title":"Ramshackle House","description":"简介： Broome\u0027s Point proper is a crescent-shaped spit of sand separating the mouth of the Pocomico River from the waters of Chesapeake Bay.
