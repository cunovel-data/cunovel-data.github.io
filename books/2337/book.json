{"id":2337,"title":"Tanner\u0027s Tiger (Evan Tanner #5)","description":"Storyline: Tanner\u0027s Tiger (Evan Tanner #5) The Cold War\u0027s boiling over. Global tensions are near the breaking point. So what\u0027s the perfect assignment for a super-spy who hasn\u0027t slept since the Korean conflict? A fun-filled trip to the Montreal World\u0027s Fair! The adorable little girl he\u0027s escorting—who, under different circumstances, would be sitting on the Lithuanian throne—can hardly contain her excitement, but it isn\u0027t all playtime for Evan Tanner. Some mysterious disappearances, apparently linked to the fair\u0027s Cuban exhibition, need to be looked into. Keeping his mind on business, however, won\u0027t be easy after an insatiable lovely in a tiger skin falls into Tanner\u0027s arms, and a mother lode of dangerous drugs falls into his lap. But the biggest, deadliest suprise is the terrorist plot Tanner\u0027s tumbling into, and he\u0027ll have to think and act quickly to prevent the visiting queen of England from being blown to smithereens.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/tanner-s-tiger-evan-tanner-5.jpg","author":"Lawrence Block","type":"Humorous","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":32,"category":{"id":13,"name":"Humorous","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
