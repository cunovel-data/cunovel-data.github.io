{"id":37970,"no":3,"title":"CHAPTER II.","content":"“MARK THE PERFECT MAN, AND BEHOLD THE UPRIGHT, FOR THE END OF THAT MAN IS PEACE.” Having given my opening chapter to an interview with Aunt Kitty, I will now tell of her husband, Rev. Horace Carr, who was born on the Aquilla Johnson farm, on Spring Creek, in District No. 1, Montgomery county, Tenn., 1812. By way of explanation, I will state that white children, in antebellum times, were taught by their parents, to call middle aged colored people Aunt, and Uncle; hence “Aunt Kitty,” and “Uncle Horace,” by the writer. From early childhood, Uncle Horace was noted for his truth, and honesty. In maturer years, strangers who met him on the highway, were impressed by his polite manners, and upright countenance. The late Col. Jno. F. House, of Clarksville, once said of him, that he had the dignified bearing of African royalty. [16]He was married during the early 30’s, and was often heard to say, that God never sent him a greater blessing than Kitty Winston. It will be remembered that the offspring of a free born parent, either mother, or father, was also free, and after several sons, and daughters were given to Aunt Kitty, and Uncle Horace, they desired to be in a home of their own; Mrs. Carr having become a widow, she was administratrix of a very nice little estate, and Uncle Horace was one of her most valuable slaves, and when it was talked around that he wished to hire himself from his mistress, very few believed that she would consent for him to leave the premises. He first talked to influential citizens of his neighborhood, as to the possibility of securing a suitable location for his humble home, and Dr. P. F. Norfleet, of Port Royal, promised to use his influence in that direction. So he sent to Mr. William Weatherford, owner of a fine farm on Red River, in sight of Port Royal, and laid the case before him. In the meantime, Uncle Horace summoned up courage enough to propose hiring himself from Miss Nancy, as he called Mrs. Carr, for the sum of $200.00, to which she consented. Mr. Weatherford kindly granted the homestead[17] site, near a secluded place on his plantation, known as “Horse Shoe Bend.” Cabin (Aunt Judy’s House) on the old Fort Plantation, in which Rev. Horace Carr preached his first sermon. A small log house was soon erected, and the Carr family, with their scant belongings went to dwell therein. And now the problem of making a living confronted them. How was it to be done? “We will work, and save, and trust in the Lord,” Uncle Horace would say. And they did. He made boards, bottomed chairs, did crude carpentering, and kept the ferry on Red River, at Port Royal, during the high water season, while his industrious little wife spun, wove, sold ginger cakes to the village groceries; now, and then, accompanying the stork on its grand mission of leaving rosebud baby girls, and boys in the homes of families, where she remained a week or two, with their mothers, in the capacity of a tender and experienced nurse. There are many mature men and women in our midst today, who first opened their baby eyes under Aunt Kitty’s watch-care. She and Uncle Horace were economical, and usually saved fifty, or seventy-five dollars, above his promised wages to Mrs. Carr. On Christmas eve morning, of each year, after[18] moving to their home near Horse Shoe Bend, he would wend his way quietly back to the old Carr homestead, with his well earned $200.00 for Miss Nancy, who always felt safe in making her Christmas purchases a week or two ahead of the holiday season, knowing he would be true to his promise. And she always had a present for his family, often a pig, with some corn to feed it. People of that date, were practical, in their present making, at Christmas time. Uncle Horace professed religion when quite young, during a revival at Red River Church, under the ministry of Elder Reuben Ross, a distinguished pioneer Baptist who came from North Carolina, to Tennessee, over a century ago. After his profession, he felt a great desire to preach, and as the years passed, the desire grew stronger, till he felt convinced that he was Divinely called. So about ten years before the Civil War, he was ordained to preach. His ordination took place in Red River Church, the primitive building on the hillside, a mile or two north west of Adams, Revs. F. C. Plaster, and W. G. Adams, officiating. There was a large congregation present, and the ceremony was said to have been a very impressive one. Mr. Lawson Fort was present and took great[19] interest in the proceedings, and followed Uncle Horace out on the church grounds and said to him: “Horace, I am a Baptist preacher’s son, but I do not belong to any church, though I have great respect for religious people. “I want to say to you, whenever you feel like preaching, or holding a prayer meeting, come to my house, and feel welcome, and I will see to it that you are not disturbed by patrolers. “You will understand, Horace, that my negroes are first-class, and I don’t care to have a mixed crowd on my premises at night. I guess your little family, and my thirty or forty, will give you a pretty fair congregation. It will be best to hold your meetings in Judy’s house, as she has no small children. “She has her Indigo dye-pots setting around in every corner, but I guess she can move them out. “Judy prays, Margaret shouts, and John exhorts, so it seems, that among them all, you might get up some pretty good meetings.” “May the Lord abundantly bless you, Mars Lawson, for such kindness to a race striving under difficulties, to serve God,” Uncle Horace replied. Prior to this, he had only held religious services in his own home, but the invitation from Mr.[20] Fort gave him fresh courage, and he retired that night with thankfulness in his heart, and a firm resolve to live up to the Divine light that had been given him. Of the two ministers who assisted in Uncle Horace’s ordination, I will speak briefly. Rev. W. S. Adams was the eldest son of Reuben Adams; the latter came to Tennessee from North Carolina in 1812, and settled on the bank of Red River in Robertson county, near where the first old Red River Church building stood. He was a penniless orphan boy, but by industry, and economy, was soon able to buy a small farm. Land at that date, was very cheap. He was married early in life, to Miss Priscilla Robinson, who made him a pleasant companion. In the early 50’s, the Edgefield and Kentucky Railroad Co. had civil engineers to blaze the path for the first railroad that ran through this section. A depot was built, and the little station called Adams, in honor of Mr. Reuben Adams. On account of this railroad passing through his premises, the value of his land was greatly increased, and from that time on, he was able to assist his children financially. Growing up while his father was poor, Rev. William Adams had but few educational advantages. He professed religion in his youth, and[21] was often heard to remark, that most he knew of the Bible, was learned in Sunday school. He was twice married, the first time to Miss Batts, of Robertson county, and second, to Miss Kosure, of Madisonville, Ky. Eight or nine children by his first marriage are all dead, while two by his second, also an aged wife, survive him, and live in Texas. Rev. Adams spent thirty odd years in the ministry. In the early 80’s he moved from Robertson county to Nashville. One morning he rose early, and remarked to his wife, that he felt unusually well, and wished to put in a good day’s work among the afflicted of the neighborhood, and spoke of first visiting Mrs. Jones across the street from his home (nee Miss Lizzie Frey), who had been one of his favorite members of Little Hope Church, in Montgomery county. Soon after breakfast, he stood before a mirror in the family room shaving, when his wife sitting near, noticed him turn suddenly pale, and stagger. She assisted him to a chair, and he died almost instantly, from heart failure. Rev. F. C. Plaster, was born in Logan county, Ky., 1805. He was of humble parentage, and like Rev. Adams, had no educational advantages. At sixteen years of age, he joined Red River[22] Church, and at twenty, he felt the Divine call to preach, and so zealous was he, that it was said of him, that while planing lumber at the carpenter’s bench, he kept his open Bible before him, studying the Scriptures while he worked. He was a man of commanding appearance, and a fine pulpit orator. He was twice married, and was the father of several sons, and daughters, by his first marriage. Both of his wives were Kentuckians, and most estimable women. In 1879, he moved with his family to Fort Deposit, Ala., and from there, a few years later, he passed from earth. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2766/76322.html","bookId":1336,"book":{"id":1336,"title":"Pioneer Colored Christians","description":"简介： In the busy rush of life, the virtues of single individuals too often escape notice, or make but slight impression on the minds of their contemporaries.
