Take me, for instance. Everybody in the town knows that my husband, Zach, and I recently got a divorce. Everybody also know that Judge Olivia Lockhard decreed a pretty unusual custody arrangement. It won\u0027t be the kids moving between my place and Zach\u0027s. We\u0027re the ones who\u0027ll be going back and forth! Olivia isn\u0027t immune to gossip herself. Will she stay with Jack, the guy who runs our local paper, or will she get back with her ex? Inquiring minds want to know! But the really big gossip has to do with the dead guy  the man who died at a local bed-and-breakfast. Who is he and why did he show up there in the middle of the night? Roy McAfee, our local private investigator, is absolutely determined to find out. I hope he does  and then I\u0027ll let you know! See you soon. . .
