He’s serious about raising quarter horses and he’s increasing his herd. When we spoke last Saturday, he said he’s thinking of hiring a full-time hand.” She began to say something else and stopped, obviously aware of her friend’s ploy. She turned to stare Olivia in the eye. “Are you going to the movies this afternoon or not?” Olivia shrugged one shoulder. Grace laughed softly. “You’re going, and judging by the smile on your face, you can hardly wait.” That was the truth. Olivia wasn’t sure how Jack was supposed to know what showing she planned to attend or which movie, but as Grace had informed her, he’d figure it out. And Grace, it turned out, knew what she was talking about. No more than five minutes after Olivia had chosen her seat, munching popcorn and waiting for the movie to start, Jack Griffin entered the theater. He looked exactly the same as the last time she’d seen him. He wore his long dark raincoat over beige slacks and a black turtleneck sweater. He walked past her down the aisle as if he hadn’t seen her and took a seat three rows up, directly in front of her. If he expected her to talk to him first, he had a lengthy wait ahead of him. Then, as though he’d forgotten something, he stood and marched toward the door. He was two steps up the aisle when he did a double-take, as if he’d just noticed her. “As I live and breathe, it’s Judge Lockhart.” “Jack Griffin, this is a pleasant surprise.” She played along, flushing with pleasure. It was so damned good to see her friend again, and the instant she did, she realized how much she’d missed him. Even more than she’d thought… “What brings you to a movie all alone in the middle of a Saturday afternoon?” he asked—as if he didn’t already know. It was time for the truth. No more games, just the truth. “You haven’t figured it out?” She grinned sheepishly up at him. “I came because of you.” “Me?” He gave an award-winning look of surprise. “Grace told me you were going to be here,” Olivia confessed. Jack snorted. “She told me you’d be here, too.” The theater darkened and Jack moved toward her row. “Do you mind if I join you?” “I was hoping you would.” He didn’t need to be invited twice, nearly leaping over her in his eagerness to get into the adjacent seat. As soon as he was settled, he tried to help himself to a handful of her popcorn. Olivia playfully slapped his wrist. “Kindly wait until I offer.” Jack sent her a hurt look, and when she slanted the bucket in his direction, he dug right in. “You couldn’t possibly eat all this by yourself, anyway.” “I might.” He snickered softly. “Are you always this bossy?” “Yes, and if you haven’t figured that out by now, you haven’t been paying attention.” “Are there makeup classes?” he asked, as he scooted down in his seat. Olivia smiled. “That can be arranged.” Jack reached for another handful of popcorn. “I’ve missed you.” Her throat tightened. “I’ve missed you, too.” The woman sitting in front of them and off to one side twisted around. Her lips were pursed in annoyance. “I hate to interrupt your reunion, but I’d like to hear the movie.” “Sorry,” Olivia whispered, mortified that someone had to shush her in the theater. She hoped the lights were too dim for anyone to recognize her. Jack straightened and leaned across the back of the seat closest to the woman who’d complained. “It’s actually all Olivia’s fault,” he said conversationally. “You see, it’s been four months since we’ve seen each other and—” “Jack!” Olivia tugged at the sleeve of his raincoat. “I don’t think it’s necessary that she hear the details of our misunderstanding.” He continued chatting as if this woman was his long-lost friend. Olivia sank down as far in the seat as she could. After several minutes, just as the previews finished, Jack turned around again. “Marion, this is Olivia. Olivia, Marion.” “Hi.” Olivia lifted one hand in greeting and offered the woman a half smile. Marion cheerfully waved back. “I’m just so glad you two are together again and that your dear, dear friend lived.” “What?” Surely Olivia had misunderstood something. “Enjoy the movie,” Jack said as he shifted back in his seat. “What was that all about?” Olivia asked, although she already knew. Jack had told another of his outrageous stories; he should’ve been writing fiction, not newspaper columns. She poked him in the ribs with her elbow when he chose to ignore her. “Shh,” Jack said, staring at the screen. He glanced away long enough to scoop up more popcorn. Olivia relaxed, and after a few moments released a pent-up sigh. It felt so good to have him back in her life. They hadn’t settled anything, hadn’t discussed any of the once-important issues. And Olivia wasn’t even sure that was necessary. She was so caught up in her thoughts, she didn’t notice that Jack had taken the entire bucket of popcorn—until she tried to get some. “Hey,” she protested. “You shouldn’t eat any more,” he asserted. “Why not?” “Because you won’t be hungry when I take you out to dinner after the movie.” “Oh.” That answered that, but didn’t explain why he continued to eat, munching down as if he hadn’t had a decent meal in weeks. “What about you?” He shrugged. “I’m always hungry.” Olivia rested her head on his shoulder and Jack put the bucket down and slid his arm around her. Like high school sweethearts, they leaned their heads against each other, holding hands. Olivia hadn’t felt this contented in months. She had no idea what the movie was about. Sunday morning, Rosie was awakened by the sound of rain beating incessantly against the apartment window. She closed her eyes and tried to go back to sleep, without success. She was awake. Wide awake. It’d taken her hours to fall asleep, and now this. Weekends were the worst for her. During the week, she was in the classroom every day, and the whole issue of the divorce and this ridiculous joint custody arrangement was easy enough to shove aside. But weekends were dreadful. She hated that Zach was at the house on Friday and Saturday nights. When she’d agreed to give him weekends, she’d thought it was poetic justice. With the children constantly underfoot, he wouldn’t be able to date much. If he realized her intention, he didn’t let on, but it gave Rosie a sense of satisfaction to thwart him at every turn, especially when it came to his relationship with Janice Lamond. Wearing her thin housecoat, Rosie wandered into the kitchen and started a pot of coffee. She wasn’t scheduled to be back at the house until five that afternoon. What they were doing made no sense—the way they were living, moving in and out of the house every few days. She couldn’t imagine what that judge was thinking. The rain continued and a chill raced up her arms. The housecoat she wore now was a summer one, inadequate to protect her against the chill of these autumn mornings. This was crazy! One set of clothes hung in her closet here and another at the house. Half the time she didn’t know what was where. The morning stretched before her, empty and bleak. A year earlier, she’d been so busy with her volunteer work that she couldn’t squeeze in time to cook her family dinner. Her charity work, along with so much else, had gone by the wayside with the divorce. She’d been forced to resign from every volunteer position—positions she’d willingly accepted. She wasn’t even missed. All her responsibilities, which were once so important, had been transferred to other people. Now she moved from school to school. Her days were filled with teaching, and when she wasn’t with the children, her nights were lonely. Her entire life had changed at the sound of a judge’s gavel. Her friends, most of whom were married, no longer seemed to have time for her. A year ago, Rosie had people to see, appointments every day, plans every night. Now there was nothing but guilt and doubts and an abundance of pain. When she finished her coffee, Rosie showered, then read the weekend editions of the Bremerton Sun and the local paper, but few of the articles held her interest. The Cedar Cove Chronicle had a brief piece about the mysterious man who’d turned up dead at the Thyme and Tide, but there didn’t seem to be any additional details. Closing her eyes, she tried to remember what it had been like before…before their marital troubles. Before the divorce. Sunday mornings had always been hectic, getting everyone ready for church and out the door in time for worship service. Until recently, she’d sung in the choir, but she’d stopped attending church once she filed for divorce. She was afraid of facing her friends and having to confess what a lie she’d been living. If she missed church services so badly, then perhaps she should go back. Not to the same church, of course, but someplace new, where she could make a fresh start. She’d been hearing good things about the pastor at the Methodist church, Dave Flemming, if she remembered his name correctly. Maybe she should think about attending there. It just might help her deal with the upheaval in her life. God knew she needed something…and fast. Decision made, Rosie quickly checked the telephone book for the times of the worship services and realized that if she left right away, she’d make the one scheduled for nine o’clock. The parking lot was nearly full when she arrived. She saw several people she knew, including Bob and Peggy Beldon from the bed-and-breakfast, and a number of parents she’d met at the Open House. Seeing Bruce Peyton and his daughter might have cheered her up, but apparently they attended elsewhere. She liked Bruce and they’d talked a couple of times, meeting for dinner once when Jolene was asleep and watched over by a neighbor. Their pain was a common bond—perhaps their only bond. The music had already started when Rosie slipped into a pew near the back of the church. Gone were the days when she proudly marched up the center aisle with her husband and children. Like so much else, her respectability had vanished with the divorce. The music was wonderful, and even in her depressed state, it lifted her spirits. She listened carefully to the sermon, but about halfway through the service she felt someone’s eyes on her. Hoping she wasn’t being obvious, she looked over her shoulder and immediately froze. It couldn’t be! Of all the coincidences in this world, why here? Why now? Two rows behind her sat Zach and Eddie. There must be fifteen churches in Cedar Cove, and she and Zach just happened to choose the same one on the same Sunday. Rosie wanted to groan with frustration. No place was safe for her. She couldn’t even walk into church and not be reminded of her past. When the service ended, Zach waited for her outside the building.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/311-pelican-court-cedar-cove-3/page-15.html","bookId":1943,"book":{"id":1943,"title":"311 Pelican Court (Cedar Cove #3)","description":"Storyline: 311 Pelican Court (Cedar Cove #3) Rosie Cox 311 Pelican Court Cedar Cove, Washington Dear Reader, One thing about Cedar Cove  people sure are interested in what other people are doing.
