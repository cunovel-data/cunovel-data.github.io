Jack ate far too many meals in restaurants. “See you in an hour?” Jack nodded. “I’ve got some work to finish up. How about two hours?” “That sounds great,” she said. Her spirits soared as she drove home, planning the rest of her menu. Jack was only ten minutes late, and by then she had salad made, the table set and the pie waiting on top of the stove. She greeted him with an enthusiastic kiss. Sliding his arms around her waist, he held her a moment longer than necessary. “I could get used to this,” Jack said, following her into the kitchen. The chicken pie smelled savory and enticing, the crust a perfect golden-brown. “So could I,” she confessed. Jack had intended to go back to the office, but he stayed instead, and they cuddled up on the sofa and watched television. At eleven, Olivia reluctantly kissed him good-night at the door, then wandered into her bedroom, feeling contented and relaxed. She looked forward to another evening like this one; they’d be having dinner again soon, on Valentine’s Day, and she was already thinking about possible restaurants. When she woke the next morning, it was because she’d heard a noise. Then she heard it again. It seemed to be coming from the kitchen. Frowning, Olivia sat up in bed. Reaching for her housecoat at the end of the bed, she slipped her arms into the sleeves, then hurried downstairs. To her dismay, she found Stan sitting at the kitchen table, drinking coffee and reading the Seattle morning paper. After the divorce, she hadn’t bothered to change the locks, but she couldn’t believe that, all these years later, Stan still had a key. Perhaps she’d forgotten to lock the door when she said goodbye to Jack. “Stan!” “Morning,” he said, as if he sat in her kitchen each and every day. “What are you doing here?” He set the coffee mug down. “Sorry if I startled you. I was in the neighborhood.” Olivia was so furious she could barely speak. How dared he enter her home without permission! “Did you get my roses?” he asked. Olivia ignored the question. “What are you doing in my home?” She emphasized the fact that this house was hers; he no longer had any rights to it. Or to her… He gave her that hurt-little-boy look she knew so well. “You’re upset, aren’t you?” he said. “I don’t think it’s a good idea for you to sneak into my home like…like a thief.” “You’re absolutely right,” he agreed. “I apologize, Olivia. Now, please, don’t be angry with me. You know I hate it when you’re angry.” Olivia refused to fall victim to his cajoling. “I don’t want it to happen again. Do you understand?” “Of course,” he said, then smiled as though she was the most enthralling woman in the world. “Now, tell me, did you receive the roses?” “I did.” “You’ll go out with me on Valentine’s, won’t you?” “No, Stan, I won’t. I think it’s time you finished your coffee and left.” He shook his head. “I think you’re actually glad to see me, but you won’t admit it.” “No, Stan, I am not glad to see you. Now, would you kindly leave.” Twenty-Two Zach replaced the telephone receiver and sighed heavily. Dashing off to the grade school because Eddie had been in a fight was not how he’d planned to spend his afternoon. However, the school had phoned him, and he didn’t have any choice. He called Cecilia into his office. “Please cancel my three o’clock appointment, apologize and reschedule as soon as possible.” Cecilia nodded. She seemed shocked when he reached for his briefcase and collected his coat. “You’re leaving?” “Unfortunately, yes.” In other circumstances he would’ve phoned Rosie and asked her to deal with the situation. Eddie was an easygoing boy and not prone to fistfights. Whatever had caused the altercation, Zach was convinced it hadn’t been Eddie’s fault. Since his blowup with Rosie in the office that day, Zach hadn’t been in contact with her. He felt bad about it, especially when Cecilia had told him how much she’d enjoyed meeting Rosie. Zach felt guilty for leaping to conclusions, but what else was he to think when he’d heard Rosie was busy chatting with Cecilia? Naturally enough, he’d assumed she was grilling his assistant for information about Janice. Only later, after his outburst, did he realize he’d made an idiot of himself. It wasn’t the first time and it probably wouldn’t be the last. In any event, they were divorced, so it shouldn’t bother him as much as it did. Still… Zach got into his car and started the engine. He placed his hands on the steering wheel as an uneasy feeling settled in the pit of his stomach. He’d made a mistake, and that mistake had cost him his marriage. Lessons didn’t come easy to him; he was still too impulsive, too ready to assume the worst—and act on it. He owed Rosie an apology, but she’d avoided him, and frankly, he was grateful. As Zach pulled into the school parking lot, he decided he should’ve called Rosie and asked her to deal with this situation, after all. She was closer to the grade school, and knew the principal. Actually, he was surprised that the authorities had notified him instead of her. The school was filled with kid noises when he opened the main doors—classes were being released for afternoon recess. Just as Zach walked into the building, a couple of hundred students shot out the doors. He couldn’t move until they’d rushed past, and found himself standing there like a rock in a fast-flowing stream. As soon as the halls had emptied, he made his way to the principal’s office. Mr. Durrell, the principal, came out of his office once his secretary had announced Zach’s arrival. The two men shook hands. “What’s the problem?” Zach asked. Durrell brought him into the other room. A petulant Eddie sat on a sofa, his shoulders slumped forward. He stared down at the floor, glancing up briefly when Zach entered. Eddie had a bruise on the side of his face and his eyes were red from crying. The principal sat at his desk and Zach took the seat next to his son. Eddie wasn’t a fighter, and Zach couldn’t imagine what had happened to bring him to blows with another student. Zach placed his arm protectively around Eddie’s shoulders. His son leaned into Zach’s strength for a moment, but then caught himself and stiffened. “Eddie was involved in a fistfight earlier today,” Mr. Durrell explained. “The other boy claims Eddie threw the first punch.” “Eddie?” Zach asked, waiting to hear his son’s version of events. “Eddie refuses to answer my questions,” the principal said. Zach turned to look at his boy. “Is it true, Eddie?” he asked gently. “Did you throw the first punch?” Eddie sniffled and wiped his nose with one sleeve. He nodded. “I’m sure there’s a good explanation,” Zach told the principal. “Eddie’s never been in any fights before.” “I agree,” Principal Durrell said, “and that’s what concerns me. This is out of character for Edward. I’m willing to overlook the incident this time, but I want assurances that it won’t happen again.” “Of course,” Zach said. “The reason I phoned you, Mr. Cox, is that this is serious. I want you to know that if Edward takes part in a second fight, I won’t have any choice but to expel him.” “I understand.” “Why don’t I give you a few minutes to talk, and then the three of us can discuss the matter before I bring in Christopher Lamond.” Mr. Durrell stood and walked out of the room. At the mention of Janice’s son, Zach’s head snapped up and his mouth went dry. As he sorted out his thoughts, Zach heard the sound of children’s laughter drifting in from outside. A bell rang, and the thunder of feet signaled that recess was over. Suddenly the halls were quiet. “You want to tell me what happened?” Zach asked once he’d regained his composure. Eddie’s shoulders had slumped so far forward, his forehead almost touched his knees. He sniffled again, then gradually straightened. “Chris said…his mom used to be your girlfriend, and that’s why you and Mom don’t live together anymore.” Zach felt as if he’d been hit square in the chest. The impact was so jarring he nearly placed his hand over his heart. “You know that’s not true.” “I told Chris, but he wouldn’t listen.” Eddie shook his head. “I shouldn’t have hit him, but he wouldn’t shut up and he kept shouting it and finally…I had to make him stop.” “What’ll happen the next time, Eddie?” “Next time,” Eddie repeated, “I’m going to look him in the eye and tell him it isn’t true and then I’ll walk away.” “That sounds like a good idea.” Zach ruffled his son’s hair. “You want me to beat him up for you?” he teased. The hint of a smile touched Eddie’s mouth. “Dad!” Zach nudged him with his elbow and Eddie nudged him back. After a couple more elbow exchanges, the door opened and Mr. Durrell returned. The three of them talked for a few minutes, and then the principal brought in the other boy. Chris refused to look at Zach. After the two boys had apologized, Mr. Durrell instructed Eddie and Christopher to go back to their respective classrooms. Zach was about to suggest Eddie come home with him, but he realized it was better that his son face his class and his friends sooner rather than later. Zach thanked Mr. Durrell and left. He pitied Chris Lamond, suspecting that Janice had paraded a number of men through her son’s life. He’d almost been one of them. Zach was halfway to the parking lot when he recognized Rosie. She was dressed in a straight skirt and matching jacket and looked…professional. Sharp and savvy. He wasn’t used to seeing her like this, and it made him feel a bit odd, as though she’d somehow become someone different. When she noticed him, she paused momentarily. Then, with her chin held high, she continued toward the school. “I’ve already been to see Mr. Durrell,” Zach said when their paths crossed. She nodded. “The school secretary called to tell me Eddie had been in a fight. I thought I’d better find out what happened. That just isn’t like him.” “Mr. Durrell phoned me.” “I didn’t know if you’d be able to come. I know how busy you are this time of year and I managed to leave a few minutes early.” “You assumed I wouldn’t come.” Zach was mildly offended that she’d expected him to put his work schedule ahead of his son’s needs. He might be lacking in a lot of other areas, but Zach prided himself on being a good father. “Oh, no, I knew you’d come. I just figured that it’d be later, and I didn’t think it was a good idea for Eddie to sit in Mr. Durrell’s office all afternoon.” She gave a quick shrug. “I was wrong—you obviously came over here right away.”","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/311-pelican-court-cedar-cove-3/page-40.html","bookId":1943,"book":{"id":1943,"title":"311 Pelican Court (Cedar Cove #3)","description":"Storyline: 311 Pelican Court (Cedar Cove #3) Rosie Cox 311 Pelican Court Cedar Cove, Washington Dear Reader, One thing about Cedar Cove  people sure are interested in what other people are doing.
