{"id":107524,"no":23,"title":"Page 23","content":"VI\n Things denied, things untold, things hidden and disguised.\n The muddy River Orr gushed over the wreckage of the stolen computer, thrown from the old stone bridge at midnight. Simon limped to work on his fractured toe and told everyone that he had slipped on the garden path. Ruth pressed ice to her bruises and concealed them inexpertly with an old tube of foundation; Andrew\u0027s lip scabbed over, like Dane Tully\u0027s, and Paul had another nosebleed on the bus and had to go straight to the nurse on arrival at school.\n Shirley Mollison, who had been shopping in Yarvil, did not answer Ruth\u0027s repeated telephone calls until late afternoon, by which time Ruth\u0027s sons had arrived home from school. Andrew listened to the one-sided conversation from the stairs outside the sitting room. He knew that Ruth was trying to take care of the problem before Simon came home, because Simon was more than capable of seizing the receiver from her and shouting and swearing at her friend.\n \u0027... just silly lies,\u0027 she was saying brightly, \u0027but we\u0027d be very grateful if you could remove it, Shirley.\u0027\n He scowled and the cut on his fat lip threatened to burst open again. He hated hearing his mother asking the woman for a favour. In that moment he was irrationally annoyed that the post had not been taken down already; then he remembered that he had written it, that he had caused everything: his mother\u0027s battered face, his own cut lip and the atmosphere of dread that pervaded the house at the prospect of Simon\u0027s return.\n \u0027I do understand you\u0027ve got a lot of things on ...\u0027 Ruth was saying cravenly, \u0027but you can see how this might do Simon damage, if people believe ...\u0027\n \u0027Yes.\u0027 Ruth sounded tired. \u0027She\u0027s going to take those things about Dad off the site so, hopefully, that\u0027ll be the end of it.\u0027\n Andrew knew his mother to be intelligent, and much handier around the house than his ham-fisted father. She was capable of earning her own living.\n \u0027Why didn\u0027t she take the post down straight away, if you\u0027re friends?\u0027 he asked, following her into the kitchen. For the first time in his life, his pity for Ruth was mingled with a feeling of frustration that amounted to anger.\n \u0027She\u0027s been busy,\u0027 snapped Ruth.\n One of her eyes was bloodshot from Simon\u0027s punch.\n \u0027Did you tell her she could be in trouble for leaving defamatory stuff on there, if she moderates the boards? We did that stuff in comput - \u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ve told you, she\u0027s taking it down, Andrew,\u0027 said Ruth angrily.\n She was not frightened of showing temper to her sons. Was it because they did not hit her, or for some other reason? Andrew knew that her face must ache as badly as his own.\n \u0027So who d\u0027you reckon wrote that stuff about Dad?\u0027 he asked her recklessly.\n She turned a face of fury upon him.\n \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 she said, \u0027but whoever they are, it was a despicable, cowardly thing to do. Everyone\u0027s got something they\u0027d like to hide. How would it be if Dad put some of the things he knows about other people on the internet? But he wouldn\u0027t do it.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027d be against his moral code, would it?\u0027 said Andrew.\n \u0027You don\u0027t know your father as well as you think you do!\u0027 shouted Ruth with tears in her eyes. \u0027Get out - go and do your homework - I don\u0027t care - just get out!\u0027\n Yet the deletion of the post could not remove it from the consciousness of those who were passionately interested in the forthcoming contest for Barry\u0027s seat. Parminder Jawanda had copied the message about Simon Price onto her computer, and kept opening it, subjecting each sentence to the scrutiny of a forensic scientist examining fibres on a corpse, searching for traces of Howard Mollison\u0027s literary DNA. He would have done all he could to disguise his distinctive phraseology, but she was sure that she recognized his pomposity in \u0027Mr Price is certainly no stranger to keeping down costs\u0027, and in \u0027the benefit of his many useful contacts\u0027.\n \u0027Minda, you don\u0027t know Simon Price,\u0027 said Tessa Wall. She and Colin were having supper with the Jawandas in the Old Vicarage kitchen, and Parminder had started on the subject of the post almost the moment they had crossed the threshold. \u0027He\u0027s a very unpleasant man and he could have upset any number of people. I honestly don\u0027t think it\u0027s Howard Mollison. I can\u0027t see him doing anything so obvious.\u0027\n \u0027Don\u0027t kid yourself, Tessa,\u0027 said Parminder. \u0027Howard will do anything to make sure Miles is elected. You watch. He\u0027ll go for Colin next.\u0027\n Tessa saw Colin\u0027s knuckles whiten on his fork handle, and wished that Parminder would think before she spoke. She, of anyone, knew what Colin was like; she prescribed his Prozac.\n Vikram was sitting at the end of the table in silence. His beautiful face fell naturally into a slightly sardonic smile. Tessa had always been intimidated by the surgeon, as she was by all very good-looking men. Although Parminder was one of Tessa\u0027s best friends, she barely knew Vikram, who worked long hours and involved himself much less in Pagford matters than his wife.\n \u0027I told you about the agenda, didn\u0027t I?\u0027 Parminder rattled on. \u0027For the next meeting? He\u0027s proposing a motion on the Fields, for us to pass to the Yarvil committee doing the boundary review, and a resolution on forcing the drug clinic out of their building. He\u0027s trying to rush it all through, while Barry\u0027s seat\u0027s empty.\u0027\n She kept leaving the table to fetch things, opening more cupboard doors than was necessary, distracted and unfocused. Twice she forgot why she had got up, and sat down again, empty-handed. Vikram watched her, everywhere she moved, from beneath his thick eyelashes.\n \u0027I rang Howard last night,\u0027 Parminder said, \u0027and I told him we ought to wait until we\u0027re back up to the full complement of councillors before we vote on such big issues. He laughed; he says we can\u0027t wait. Yarvil wants to hear our views, he said, with the boundary review coming up. What he\u0027s really scared of is that Colin\u0027s going to win Barry\u0027s seat, because it won\u0027t be so easy to foist it all on us then. I\u0027ve emailed everyone I think will vote with us, to see if they can\u0027t put pressure on him to delay the votes, for one meeting ...\n \u0027\"The Ghost of Barry Fairbrother\",\u0027 Parminder added breathlessly. \u0027The bastard. He\u0027s not using Barry\u0027s death to beat him. Not if I can help it.\u0027\n Tessa thought she saw Vikram\u0027s lips twitch. Old Pagford, led by Howard Mollison, generally forgave Vikram the crimes that it could not forget in his wife: brownness, cleverness and affluence (all of which, to Shirley Mollison\u0027s nostrils, had the whiff of a gloat). It was, Tessa thought, grossly unfair: Parminder worked hard at every aspect of her Pagford life: school f��tes and sponsored bakes, the local surgery and the Parish Council, and her reward was implacable dislike from the Pagford old guard; Vikram, who rarely joined or participated in anything, was fawned upon, flattered and spoken of with proprietary approval.\n \u0027Mollison\u0027s a megalomaniac,\u0027 Parminder said, pushing food nervously around her plate. \u0027A bully and a megalomaniac.\u0027\n Vikram laid down his knife and fork and sat back in his chair.\n \u0027So why,\u0027 he asked, \u0027is he happy being chair of the Parish Council? Why hasn\u0027t he tried to get on the District Council?\u0027\n \u0027Because he thinks that Pagford is the epicentre of the universe,\u0027 snapped Parminder. \u0027You don\u0027t understand: he wouldn\u0027t swap being chair of Pagford Parish Council for being Prime Minister. Anyway, he doesn\u0027t need to be on the council in Yarvil; he\u0027s already got Aubrey Fawley there, pushing through the big agenda. All revved up for the boundary review. They\u0027re working together.\u0027\n Parminder felt Barry\u0027s absence like a ghost at the table. He would have explained it all to Vikram and made him laugh in the process; Barry had been a superb mimic of Howard\u0027s speech patterns, of his rolling, waddling walk, of his sudden gastrointestinal interruptions.\n \u0027I keep telling her, she\u0027s letting herself get too stressed,\u0027 Vikram told Tessa, who was appalled to find herself blushing slightly, with his dark eyes upon her. \u0027You know about this stupid complaint - the old woman with emphysema?\u0027\n \u0027Yes, Tessa knows. Everyone knows. Do we have to discuss it at the dinner table?\u0027 snapped Parminder, and she jumped to her feet and began clearing the plates.\n Tessa tried to help, but Parminder told her crossly to stay where she was. Vikram gave Tessa a small smile of solidarity that made her stomach flutter. She could not help remembering, as Parminder clattered around the table, that Vikram and Parminder had had an arranged marriage.\n (\u0027It\u0027s only an introduction through the family,\u0027 Parminder had told her, in the early days of their friendship, defensive and annoyed at something she had seen in Tessa\u0027s face. \u0027Nobody makes you marry, you know.\u0027\n But she had spoken, at other times, of the immense pressure from her mother to take a husband.\n \u0027All Sikh parents want their kids married. It\u0027s an obsession,\u0027 Parminder said bitterly.)\n Colin saw his plate snatched away without regret. The nausea churning in his stomach was even worse than when he and Tessa had arrived. He might have been encased in a thick glass bubble, so separate did he feel from his three dining companions. It was a sensation with which he was only too familiar, that of walking in a giant sphere of worry, enclosed by it, watching his own terrors roll by, obscuring the outside world.\n Tessa was no help: she was being deliberately cool and unsympathetic about his campaign for Barry\u0027s seat. The whole point of this supper was so that Colin could consult Parminder on the little leaflets he had produced, advertising his candidacy. Tessa was refusing to get involved, blocking discussion of the fear that was slowly engulfing him. She was refusing him an outlet.\n Trying to emulate her coolness, pretending that he was not, after all, caving under self-imposed pressure, he had not told her about the telephone call from the Yarvil and District Gazette that he had received at school that day. The journalist on the end of the line had wanted to talk about Krystal Weedon.\n Had he touched her?\n Colin had told the woman that the school could not possibly discuss a pupil and that Krystal must be approached through her parents.\n \u0027I\u0027ve already talked to Krystal,\u0027 said the voice on the end of the line. \u0027I only wanted to get your - \u0027\n But he had put the receiver down, and terror had blotted out everything.\n Why did they want to talk about Krystal? Why had they called him? Had he done something? Had he touched her? Had she complained?\n The psychologist had taught him not to try and confirm or disprove the content of such thoughts. He was supposed to acknowledge their existence, then carry on as normal, but it was like trying not to scratch the worst itch you had ever known. The public unveiling of Simon Price\u0027s dirty secrets on the council website had stunned him: the terror of exposure, which had dominated so much of Colin\u0027s life, now wore a face, its features those of an ageing cherub, with a demonic brain seething beneath a deerstalker on tight grey curls, behind bulging inquisitive eyes. He kept remembering Barry\u0027s tales of the delicatessen owner\u0027s formidable strategic brain, and of the intricate web of alliances that bound the sixteen members of Pagford Parish Council.\n Colin had often imagined how he would find out that the game was up: a guarded article in the paper; faces turned away from him when he entered Mollison and Lowe\u0027s; the headmistress calling him into her office for a quiet word. He had visualized his downfall a thousand times: his shame exposed and hung around his neck like a leper\u0027s bell, so that no concealment would be possible, ever again. He would be sacked. He might end up in prison.\n \u0027Colin,\u0027 Tessa prompted quietly; Vikram was offering him wine.\n She knew what was going on inside that big domed forehead; not the specifics, but the theme of his anxiety had been constant for years. She knew that Colin could not help it; it was the way he was made. Many years before, she had read, and recognized as true, the words of W. B. Yeats: \u0027A pity beyond all telling is hid at the heart of love.\u0027 She had smiled over the poem, and stroked the page, because she had known both that she loved Colin, and that compassion formed a huge part of her love.\n Sometimes, though, her patience wore thin. Sometimes she wanted a little concern and reassurance too. Colin had erupted into a predictable panic when she had told him that she had received a firm diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes, but once she had convinced him that she was not in imminent danger of dying, she had been taken aback by how quickly he dropped the subject, how completely he reimmersed himself in his election plans.\n (That morning, at breakfast, she had tested her blood sugar with the glucometer for the first time, then taken out the prefilled needle and inserted it into her own belly. It had hurt much more than when deft Parminder did it.\n Fats had seized his cereal bowl and swung round in his chair away from her, sloshing milk over the table, the sleeve of his school shirt and onto the kitchen floor. Colin had let out an inchoate shout of annoyance as Fats spat his mouthful of cornflakes back into his bowl, and demanded of his mother, \u0027Have you got to do that at the bloody table?\u0027\n \u0027Don\u0027t be so damn rude and disgusting!\u0027 shouted Colin. \u0027Sit up properly! Wipe up that mess! How dare you speak to your mother like that? Apologize!\u0027\n Tessa withdrew the needle too fast; she had made herself bleed.\n \u0027I\u0027m sorry that you shooting up at breakfast makes me want to puke, Tess,\u0027 said Fats from under the table, where he was wiping the floor with a bit of kitchen roll.\n \u0027Your mother isn\u0027t \"shooting up\", she\u0027s got a medical condition!\u0027 shouted Colin. \u0027And don\u0027t call her \"Tess\"!\u0027\n \u0027I know you don\u0027t like needles, Stu,\u0027 said Tessa, but her eyes were stinging; she had hurt herself, and felt shaken and angry with both of them, feelings that were still with her this evening.)\n Tessa wondered why Parminder did not appreciate Vikram\u0027s concern. Colin never noticed when she was stressed. Perhaps, Tessa thought angrily, there\u0027s something in this arranged marriage business ... my mother certainly wouldn\u0027t have chosen Colin for me ...\n Parminder was shoving bowls of cut fruit across the table for pudding. Tessa wondered a little resentfully what she would have offered a guest who was not diabetic, and comforted herself with the thought of a bar of chocolate lying at home in the fridge.\n Parminder, who had talked five times as much as anybody else all through supper, had started ranting about her daughter, Sukhvinder. She had already told Tessa on the telephone about the girl\u0027s betrayal; she went through it all again at the table.\n \u0027Waitressing with Howard Mollison. I don\u0027t, I really don\u0027t know what she\u0027s thinking. But Vikram - \u0027\n \u0027They don\u0027t think, Minda,\u0027 Colin proclaimed, breaking his long silence. \u0027That\u0027s teenagers. They don\u0027t care. They\u0027re all the same.\u0027\n \u0027Colin, what rubbish,\u0027 snapped Tessa. \u0027They aren\u0027t all the same at all. We\u0027d be delighted if Stu went and got himself a Saturday job - not that there\u0027s the remotest chance of that.\u0027\n \u0027 - but Vikram doesn\u0027t mind,\u0027 Parminder pressed on, ignoring the interruption. \u0027He can\u0027t see anything wrong with it, can you?\u0027\n Vikram answered easily: \u0027It\u0027s work experience. She probably won\u0027t make university; there\u0027s no shame in it. It\u0027s not for everyone. I can see Jolly married early, quite happy.\u0027\n \u0027Waitressing ...\u0027\n \u0027Well, they can\u0027t all be academic, can they?\u0027\n \u0027No, she certainly isn\u0027t academic,\u0027 said Parminder, who was almost quivering with anger and tension. \u0027Her marks are absolutely atrocious - no aspiration, no ambition - waitressing - \"let\u0027s face it, I\u0027m not going to get into uni\" - no, you certainly won\u0027t, with that attitude - with Howard Mollison ... oh, he must have absolutely loved it - my daughter going cap in hand for a job. What was she thinking - what was she thinking?\u0027\n \u0027You wouldn\u0027t like it if Stu took a job with someone like Mollison,\u0027 Colin told Tessa.\n \u0027I wouldn\u0027t care,\u0027 said Tessa. \u0027I\u0027d be thrilled he was showing any kind of work ethic. As far as I can tell, all he seems to care about is computer games and - \u0027\n But Colin did not know that Stuart smoked; she broke off, and Colin said, \u0027Actually, this would be exactly the kind of thing Stuart would do. Insinuate himself with somebody he knew we didn\u0027t like, to get at us. He\u0027d love that.\u0027\n \u0027For goodness sake, Colin, Sukhvinder isn\u0027t trying to get at Minda,\u0027 said Tessa.\n \u0027So you think I\u0027m being unreasonable?\u0027 Parminder shot at Tessa.\n \u0027No, no,\u0027 said Tessa, appalled at how quickly they had been sucked into the family row. \u0027I\u0027m just saying, there aren\u0027t many places for kids to work in Pagford, are there?\u0027\n \u0027And why does she need to work at all?\u0027 said Parminder, raising her hands in a gesture of furious exasperation. \u0027Don\u0027t we give her enough money?\u0027\n \u0027Money you earn yourself is always different, you know that,\u0027 said Tessa.\n Tessa\u0027s chair faced a wall that was covered in photographs of the Jawanda children. She had sat here often, and had counted how many appearances each child made: Jaswant, eighteen; Rajpal, nineteen; and Sukhvinder, nine. There was only one photograph on the wall celebrating Sukhvinder\u0027s individual achievements: the picture of the Winterdown rowing team on the day that they had beaten St Anne\u0027s. Barry had given all the parents an enlarged copy of this picture, in which Sukhvinder and Krystal Weedon were in the middle of the line of eight, with their arms around each other\u0027s shoulders, beaming and jumping up and down so that they were both slightly blurred.\n Barry, she thought, would have helped Parminder see things the right way. He had been a bridge between mother and daughter, both of whom had adored him.\n Not for the first time, Tessa wondered how much difference it made that she had not given birth to her son. Did she find it easier to accept him as a separate individual than if he had been made from her flesh and blood? Her glucose-heavy, tainted blood ...\n Fats had recently stopped calling her \u0027Mum\u0027. She had to pretend not to care, because it made Colin so angry; but every time Fats said \u0027Tessa\u0027 it was like a needle jab to her heart.\n The four of them finished their cold fruit in silence. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-casual-vacancy/page-23.html","bookId":2230,"book":{"id":2230,"title":"The Casual Vacancy","description":"Storyline: \n When Barry Fairbrother dies unexpectedly in his early forties, the little town of Pagford is left in shock.
