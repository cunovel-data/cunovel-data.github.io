{"id":107555,"no":56,"title":"Page 56","content":"III Andrew had refused a lift back to Hilltop House, so it was only Tessa and Fats in the car together, and Fats said, \u0027I don\u0027t want to go home.\u0027 \u0027All right,\u0027 Tessa replied, and she drove, while talking to Colin on the telephone. \u0027I\u0027ve got him ... Andy found him. We\u0027ll be back in a bit ... Yes ... Yes, I will ...\u0027 Tears were spattering down Fats\u0027 face; his body was betraying him; it was exactly like the time when hot urine had spilt down his leg into his sock, when Simon Price had made him piss himself. The hot saltiness leaked over his chin and onto his chest, pattering like drops of rain. He kept imagining the funeral. A tiny little coffin. He had not wanted to do it with the boy so near. Would the weight of the dead child ever lift from him? \u0027So you ran away,\u0027 said Tessa coldly, over his tears. She had prayed that she would find him alive, but her strongest emotion was disgust. His tears did not soften her. She was used to men\u0027s tears. Part of her was ashamed that he had not, after all, thrown himself into the river. \u0027Krystal told the police that you and she were in the bushes. You just left him to his own devices, did you?\u0027 Fats was speechless. He could not believe her cruelty. Did she not understand the desolation roaring inside him, the horror, the sense of contagion? \u0027Well, I hope you have got her pregnant,\u0027 said Tessa. \u0027It\u0027ll give her something to live for.\u0027 Every time they turned a corner, he thought that she was taking him home. He had feared Cubby most, but now there was nothing to choose between his parents. He wanted to get out of the car, but she had locked all the doors. Without warning, she swerved and braked. Fats, clutching the sides of his seat, saw that they were in a lay-by on the Yarvil bypass. Frightened that she would order him out of the car, he turned his swollen face to her. \u0027Your birth mother,\u0027 she said, looking at him as she had never done before, without pity or kindness, \u0027was fourteen years old. We had the impression, from what we were told, that she was middle class, quite a bright girl. She absolutely refused to say who your father was. Nobody knew whether she was trying to protect an under-age boyfriend or something worse. We were told all of this, in case you had any mental or physical difficulties. In case,\u0027 she said clearly, like a teacher trying to emphasize a point sure to come up in a test, \u0027you had been the result of incest.\u0027 He cowered away from her. He would have preferred to be shot. \u0027I was desperate to adopt you,\u0027 she said. \u0027Desperate. But Dad was very ill. He said to me, \"I can\u0027t do it. I\u0027m scared I\u0027ll hurt a baby. I need to get better before we do this, and I can\u0027t do that and cope with a new baby as well.\" \u0027But I was so determined to have you,\u0027 said Tessa, \u0027that I pressured him into lying, and telling the social workers that he was fine, and pretending to be happy and normal. We brought you home, and you were tiny and premature, and on the fifth night we had you, Dad slipped out of bed and went to the garage, put a hosepipe on the exhaust of the car and tried to kill himself, because he was convinced he\u0027d smothered you. And he almost died. \u0027So you can blame me,\u0027 said Tessa, \u0027for your and Dad\u0027s bad start, and maybe you can blame me for everything that\u0027s come since. But I\u0027ll tell you this, Stuart. Your father\u0027s spent his life facing up to things he never did. I don\u0027t expect you to understand his kind of courage. But,\u0027 her voice broke at last, and he heard the mother he knew, \u0027he loves you, Stuart.\u0027 She added the lie because she could not help herself. Tonight, for the first time, Tessa was convinced that it was a lie, and also that everything she had done in her life, telling herself that it was for the best, had been no more than blind selfishness, generating confusion and mess all around. But who could bear to know which stars were already dead, she thought, blinking up at the night sky; could anybody stand to know that they all were? She turned the key in the ignition, crashed the gears and they pulled out again onto the bypass. \u0027I don\u0027t want to go to the Fields,\u0027 said Fats in terror. \u0027We\u0027re not going to the Fields,\u0027 she said. \u0027I\u0027m taking you home.\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-casual-vacancy/page-56.html","bookId":2230,"book":{"id":2230,"title":"The Casual Vacancy","description":"Storyline: When Barry Fairbrother dies unexpectedly in his early forties, the little town of Pagford is left in shock.
