{"id":107521,"no":20,"title":"Page 20","content":"III Gavin could have invited Mary into his office to discuss the most recent exchange of letters with the insurance company, but decided to visit her at home instead. He had kept the late afternoon free of appointments, on the off-chance that she might ask him to stay for something to eat; she was a fantastic cook. His instinctive shying away from her naked grief had been dissipated by regular contact. He had always liked Mary, but Barry had eclipsed her in company. Not that she ever appeared to dislike her supporting role; on the contrary, she had seemed delighted to beautify the background, happy laughing at Barry\u0027s jokes, happy simply to be with him. Gavin doubted that Kay had ever been happy to play second fiddle in her life. Crashing the gears as he drove up Church Row, he thought that Kay would have been outraged by any suggestion that she modify her behaviour or suppress her opinions for the sake of her partner\u0027s enjoyment, his happiness or his self-esteem. He did not think that he had ever been unhappier in a relationship than he was now. Even in the death throes of the affair with Lisa, there had been temporary truces, laughs, sudden poignant reminders of better times. The situation with Kay was like war. Sometimes he forgot that there was supposed to be any affection between them; did she even like him? They had had their worst ever argument by telephone on the morning after Miles and Samantha\u0027s dinner party. Eventually, Kay had slammed down the receiver, cutting Gavin off. For a full twenty-four hours he had believed that their relationship was at an end, and although this was what he wanted he had experienced more fear than relief. In his fantasies, Kay simply disappeared back to London, but the reality was that she had tethered herself to Pagford with a job and a daughter at Winterdown. He faced the prospect of bumping into her wherever he went in the tiny town. Perhaps she was already poisoning the well of gossip against him; he imagined her repeating some of the things she had said to him on the telephone to Samantha, or to that nosy old woman in the delicatessen who gave him goose-flesh. I uprooted my daughter and left my job and moved house for you, and you treat me like a hooker you don\u0027t have to pay. People would say that he had behaved badly. Perhaps he had behaved badly. There must have been a crucial point when he ought to have pulled back, but he had not seen it. Gavin spent the whole weekend brooding on how it would feel to be seen as the bad guy. He had never been in that position before. After Lisa had left him, everybody had been kind and sympathetic, especially the Fairbrothers. Guilt and dread dogged him until, on Sunday evening, he cracked and called Kay to apologize. Now he was back where he did not want to be, and he hated Kay for it. Parking his car in the Fairbrothers\u0027 drive, as he had done so often when Barry was alive, he headed for the front door, noticing that somebody had mowed the lawn since he had last called. Mary answered his ring on the doorbell almost instantaneously. \u0027Hi, how - Mary, what\u0027s wrong?\u0027 Her whole face was wet, her eyes brimming with diamond-bright tears. She gulped once or twice, shook her head, and then, without quite knowing how it had happened, Gavin found himself holding her in his arms on the doorstep. \u0027Mary? Has something happened?\u0027 He felt her nod. Acutely aware of their exposed position, of the open road behind him, Gavin manoeuvred her inside. She was small and fragile in his arms; her fingers clutched at him, her face pressed into his coat. He relinquished his briefcase as gently as he could, but the sound of it hitting the floor made her withdraw from him, her breath short as she covered her mouth with her hands. \u0027I\u0027m sorry ... I\u0027m sorry ... oh God, Gav ...\u0027 \u0027What\u0027s happened?\u0027 His voice sounded different from usual: forceful, take command, more like the way Miles sometimes talked in a crisis at work. \u0027Someone\u0027s put ... I don\u0027t ... someone\u0027s put Barry\u0027s ...\u0027 She beckoned him into the home office, cluttered, shabby and cosy, with Barry\u0027s old rowing trophies on the shelves, and a big framed photograph on the wall of eight teenage girls punching the air, with medals around their necks. Mary pointed a trembling finger at the computer screen. Still in his coat, Gavin dropped into the chair and stared at the message board of Pagford Parish Council\u0027s website. \u0027I w-was in the delicatessen this morning, and Maureen Lowe told me that lots of people had put messages of condolence on the site ... so I was going to p-post a message to s-say thank you. And - look ...\u0027 He spotted it as she spoke. Simon Price Unfit to Stand for Council, posted by The Ghost of Barry Fairbrother. \u0027Jesus Christ,\u0027 said Gavin in disgust. Mary dissolved into tears again. Gavin wanted to put his arms back around her, but was afraid to, especially here, in this snug little room so full of Barry. He compromised by taking hold of her thin wrist and leading her through the hall into the kitchen. \u0027You need a drink,\u0027 he told her, in that unfamiliarly strong and commanding voice. \u0027Sod coffee. Where\u0027s the proper stuff?\u0027 But he remembered before she answered; he had seen Barry take the bottles out of the cupboard often enough, so he mixed her a small gin and tonic, which was the only thing he had ever known her drink before dinner. \u0027Gav, it\u0027s four in the afternoon.\u0027 \u0027Who gives a damn?\u0027 said Gavin, in his new voice. \u0027Get that down you.\u0027 An unbalanced laugh broke her sobs; she accepted the glass and sipped. He fetched her kitchen roll to mop her face and eyes. \u0027You\u0027re so kind, Gav. Don\u0027t you want anything? Coffee or ... or beer?\u0027 she asked, on another weak laugh. He fetched himself a bottle from the fridge, took off his coat and sat down opposite her at the island in the middle of the room. After a while, when she had drunk most of her gin, she became calm and quiet again, the way he always thought of her. \u0027Who d\u0027you think did it?\u0027 she asked him. \u0027Some total bastard,\u0027 said Gavin. \u0027They\u0027re all fighting over his council seat, now. Squabbling away over the Fields as usual. And he\u0027s still in there, putting his two cents in. The Ghost of Barry Fairbrother. Maybe it really is him, posting on the message board?\u0027 Gavin did not know whether this was meant as a joke, and settled for a slight smile that might be quickly removed. \u0027You know, I\u0027d love to think that he\u0027s worrying about us, wherever he is; about me and the kids. But I doubt it. I\u0027ll bet he\u0027s still most worried about Krystal Weedon. Do you know what he\u0027d probably say to me if he was here?\u0027 She drained her glass. Gavin had not thought that he had mixed the gin very strong, but there were patches of high colour on her cheeks. \u0027No,\u0027 he said cautiously. \u0027He\u0027d tell me that I\u0027ve got support,\u0027 said Mary, and to Gavin\u0027s astonishment, he heard anger in the voice he always thought of as gentle. \u0027Yeah, he\u0027d probably say, \"You\u0027ve got all the family and our friends and the kids to comfort you, but Krystal,\"\u0027 Mary\u0027s voice was becoming louder, \u0027\"Krystal\u0027s got nobody to look out for her.\" D\u0027you know what he spent our wedding anniversary doing?\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 said Gavin again. \u0027Writing an article for the local paper about Krystal. Krystal and the Fields. The bloody Fields. If I never hear them mentioned again, it\u0027ll be too soon. I want another gin. I don\u0027t drink enough.\u0027 Gavin picked up her glass automatically and returned to the drinks cupboard, stunned. He had always regarded her and Barry\u0027s marriage as literally perfect. Never had it occurred to him that Mary might be other than one hundred per cent approving of every venture and crusade with which the ever-busy Barry concerned himself. \u0027Rowing practice in the evenings, driving them to races at the weekends,\u0027 she said, over the tinkling of ice he was adding to her glass, \u0027and most nights he was on the computer, trying to get people to support him about the Fields, and getting stuff on the agenda for council meetings. And everyone always said, \"Isn\u0027t Barry marvellous, the way he does it all, the way he volunteers, he\u0027s so involved with the community.\"\u0027 She took a big gulp of her fresh gin and tonic. \u0027Yes, marvellous. Absolutely marvellous. Until it killed him. All day long, on our wedding anniversary, struggling to meet that stupid deadline. They haven\u0027t even printed it yet.\u0027 Gavin could not take his eyes off her. Anger and alcohol had restored colour to her face. She was sitting upright, instead of cowed and hunched over, as she had been recently. \u0027That\u0027s what killed him,\u0027 she said clearly, and her voice echoed a little in the kitchen. \u0027He gave everything to everybody. Except to me.\u0027 Ever since Barry\u0027s funeral, Gavin had dwelled, with a sense of deep inadequacy, on the comparatively small gap that he was sure he would leave behind in his community, should he die. Looking at Mary, he wondered whether it would not be better to leave a huge hole in one person\u0027s heart. Had Barry not realized how Mary felt? Had he not realized how lucky he was? The front door opened with a loud clatter, and he heard the sound of the four children coming in; voices and footsteps and the thumping of shoes and bags. \u0027Hi, Gav,\u0027 said eighteen-year-old Fergus, kissing his mother on top of her head. \u0027Are you drinking, Mum?\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s my fault,\u0027 said Gavin. \u0027Blame me.\u0027 They were such nice kids, the Fairbrother kids. Gavin liked the way they talked to their mother, hugged her, chatted to each other and to him. They were open, polite and funny. He thought of Gaia, her vicious asides, silences like jagged glass, the snarling way she addressed him. \u0027Gav, we haven\u0027t even talked about the insurance,\u0027 said Mary, as the children surged around the kitchen, finding themselves drinks and snacks. \u0027It doesn\u0027t matter,\u0027 said Gavin, without thinking, before correcting himself hastily; \u0027shall we go through to the sitting room or ...?\u0027 \u0027Yes, let\u0027s.\u0027 She wobbled a little getting down from the high kitchen stool, and he caught her arm again. \u0027Are you staying for dinner, Gav?\u0027 called Fergus. \u0027Do, if you want to,\u0027 said Mary. A surge of warmth flooded him. \u0027I\u0027d love to,\u0027 he said. \u0027Thanks.\u0027","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-casual-vacancy/page-20.html","bookId":2230,"book":{"id":2230,"title":"The Casual Vacancy","description":"Storyline: When Barry Fairbrother dies unexpectedly in his early forties, the little town of Pagford is left in shock.
