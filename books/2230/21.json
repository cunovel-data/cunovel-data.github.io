A look of delighted disapproval was crumpling her face; Samantha, who was in a very bad mood, thought she resembled a monkey nut. Miles was making conventional sounds of surprise and pity, but Shirley was staring up at the ceiling with a bland expression on her face; she hated it when Maureen held centre stage with news that she ought to have heard first.\\n\\n \u0027My mother knew the family of old,\u0027 Howard told Samantha, who already knew it. \u0027Neighbours in Hope Street. Cath was decent enough in her way, you know. The house was always spotless, and she worked until she was into her sixties. Oh, yes, she was one of the world\u0027s grafters, Cath Weedon, whatever the rest of the family became.\u0027\\n\\n Howard was enjoying giving credit where credit was due.\\n\\n \u0027The husband lost his job when they closed the steelworks. Hard drinker. No, she didn\u0027t always have it easy, Cath.\u0027\\n\\n Samantha was barely managing to look interested, but fortunately Maureen interrupted.\\n\\n \u0027And the Gazette\u0027s on to Dr Jawanda!\u0027 she croaked. \u0027Imagine how she must be feeling, now the paper\u0027s got it! Family\u0027s kicking up a stink - well, you can\u0027t blame them, alone in that house for three days. D\u0027you know her, Howard? Which one is Danielle Fowler?\u0027\\n\\n Shirley got up and stalked out of the room in her apron. Samantha slugged a little more wine, smiling.\\n\\n \u0027Let\u0027s think, let\u0027s think,\u0027 said Howard. He prided himself on knowing almost everyone in Pagford, but the later generations of Weedons belonged more to Yarvil. \u0027Can\u0027t be a daughter, she had four boys, Cath. Granddaughter, I expect.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And she wants an inquiry,\u0027 said Maureen. \u0027Well, it was always going to come to this. It\u0027s been on the cards. If anything, I\u0027m surprised it\u0027s taken this long. Dr Jawanda wouldn\u0027t give the Hubbards\u0027 son antibiotics and he ended up hospitalized for his asthma. Do you know, did she train in India, or - ?\u0027\\n\\n Shirley, who was listening from the kitchen while she stirred the gravy, felt irritated, as she always did, by Maureen\u0027s monopolization of the conversation; that, at least, was how Shirley put it to herself. Determined not to return to the room until Maureen had finished, Shirley turned into the study and checked to see whether anyone had sent in apologies for the next Parish Council meeting; as secretary, she was already putting together the agenda.\\n\\n \u0027Howard - Miles - come and look at this!\u0027\\n\\n Shirley\u0027s voice had lost its usual soft, flutey quality; it rang out shrilly.\\n\\n Howard waddled out of the sitting room followed by Miles, who was still in the suit he had worn all day at work. Maureen\u0027s droopy, bloodshot, heavily mascara-ed eyes were fixed on the empty doorway like a bloodhound\u0027s; her hunger to know what Shirley had found or seen was almost palpable. Maureen\u0027s fingers, a clutch of bulging knuckles covered in translucent leopard-spotted skin, slid the crucifix and wedding ring up and down the chain around her neck. The deep creases running from the corners of Maureen\u0027s mouth to her chin always reminded Samantha of a ventriloquist\u0027s dummy.\\n\\n Why are you always here? Samantha asked the older woman loudly, inside her own head. You couldn\u0027t make me lonely enough to live in Howard and Shirley\u0027s pocket.\\n\\n Disgust rose in Samantha like vomit. She wanted to seize the over-warm cluttered room and mash it between her hands, until the royal china, and the gas fire, and the gilt-framed pictures of Miles broke into jagged pieces; then, with wizened and painted Maureen trapped and squalling inside the wreckage, she wanted to heave it, like a celestial shot-putter, away into the sunset. The crushed lounge and the doomed crone inside it, soared in her imagination through the heavens, plunging into the limitless ocean, leaving Samantha alone in the endless stillness of the universe.\\n\\n She had had a terrible afternoon. There had been another frightening conversation with her accountant; she could not remember much of her drive home from Yarvil. She would have liked to offload on Miles, but after dumping his briefcase and pulling off his tie in the hall he had said, \u0027You haven\u0027t started dinner yet, have you?\u0027\\n\\n He sniffed the air ostentatiously, then answered himself.\\n\\n \u0027No, you haven\u0027t. Well, good, because Mum and Dad have invited us over.\u0027 And before she could protest, he had added sharply, \u0027It\u0027s nothing to do with the council. It\u0027s to discuss arrangements for Dad\u0027s sixty-fifth.\u0027\\n\\n Anger was almost a relief; it eclipsed her anxiety, her fear. She had followed Miles out to the car, cradling her sense of ill-usage. When he asked, at last, on the corner of Evertree Crescent, \u0027How was your day?\u0027 she answered, \u0027Absolutely bloody fantastic.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Wonder what\u0027s up?\u0027 said Maureen, breaking the silence in the sitting room.\\n\\n Samantha shrugged. It was typical of Shirley to have summoned her menfolk and left the women in limbo; Samantha was not going to give her mother-in-law the satisfaction of showing interest.\\n\\n Howard\u0027s elephantine footsteps made the floorboards under the hall carpet creak. Maureen\u0027s mouth was slack with anticipation.\\n\\n \u0027Well, well, well,\u0027 boomed Howard, lumbering back into the room.\\n\\n \u0027I was checking the council website for apologies,\u0027 said Shirley, a little breathless in his wake. \u0027For the next meeting - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027Someone\u0027s posted accusations about Simon Price,\u0027 Miles told Samantha, pressing past his parents, seizing the role of announcer.\\n\\n \u0027What kind of accusations?\u0027 asked Samantha.\\n\\n \u0027Receiving stolen goods,\u0027 said Howard, firmly reclaiming the spotlight, \u0027and diddling his bosses at the printworks.\u0027\\n\\n Samantha was pleased to find herself unmoved. She had only the haziest idea who Simon Price was.\\n\\n \u0027They\u0027ve posted under a pseudonym,\u0027 Howard continued, \u0027and it\u0027s not a particularly tasteful pseudonym, either.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Rude, you mean?\u0027 Samantha asked. \u0027Big-Fat-Cock or something?\u0027\\n\\n Howard\u0027s laughter boomed through the room, Maureen gave an affected shriek of horror, but Miles scowled and Shirley looked furious.\\n\\n \u0027Not quite that, Sammy, no,\u0027 said Howard. \u0027No, they\u0027ve called themselves \"The Ghost of Barry Fairbrother\".\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh,\u0027 said Samantha, her grin evaporating. She did not like that. After all, she had been in the ambulance while they had forced needles and tubes into Barry\u0027s collapsed body; she had watched him dying beneath the plastic mask; seen Mary clinging to his hand, heard her groans and sobs.\\n\\n \u0027Oh, no, that\u0027s not nice,\u0027 said Maureen, relish in her bullfrog\u0027s voice. \u0027No, that\u0027s nasty. Putting words into the mouths of the dead. Taking names in vain. That\u0027s not right.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 agreed Howard. Almost absent-mindedly, he strolled across the room, picked up the wine bottle and returned to Samantha, topping up her empty glass. \u0027But someone out there doesn\u0027t care about good taste it seems, if they can put Simon Price out of the running.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027If you\u0027re thinking what I think you\u0027re thinking, Dad,\u0027 said Miles, \u0027wouldn\u0027t they have gone for me rather than Price?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027How do you know they haven\u0027t, Miles?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Meaning?\u0027 asked Miles swiftly.\\n\\n \u0027Meaning,\u0027 said Howard, the happy cynosure of all eyes, \u0027that I got sent an anonymous letter about you a couple of weeks ago. Nothing specific. Just said you were unfit to fill Fairbrother\u0027s shoes. I\u0027d be very surprised if the letter didn\u0027t come from the same source as the online post. The Fairbrother theme in both, you see?\u0027\\n\\n Samantha tilted her glass a little too enthusiastically, so that wine trickled down the sides of her chin, exactly where her own ventriloquist\u0027s doll grooves would no doubt appear in time. She mopped her face with her sleeve.\\n\\n \u0027Where is this letter?\u0027 asked Miles, striving not to look rattled.\\n\\n \u0027I shredded it. It was anonymous; it didn\u0027t count.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We didn\u0027t want to upset you, dear,\u0027 said Shirley, and she patted Miles\u0027 arm.\\n\\n \u0027Anyway, they can\u0027t have anything on you,\u0027 Howard reassured his son, \u0027or they\u0027d have dished the dirt, the same as they have on Price.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Simon Price\u0027s wife is a lovely girl,\u0027 said Shirley with gentle regret. \u0027I can\u0027t believe Ruth knows anything about it, if her husband\u0027s been on the fiddle. She\u0027s a friend from the hospital,\u0027 Shirley elaborated to Maureen. \u0027An agency nurse.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027She wouldn\u0027t be the first wife who hasn\u0027t spotted what\u0027s going on under her nose,\u0027 retorted Maureen, trumping insider knowledge with worldly wisdom.\\n\\n \u0027Absolutely brazen, using Barry Fairbrother\u0027s name,\u0027 said Shirley, pretending not to have heard Maureen. \u0027Not a thought for his widow, his family. All that matters is their agenda; they\u0027ll sacrifice anything to it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Shows you what we\u0027re up against,\u0027 said Howard. He scratched the overfold of his belly, thinking. \u0027Strategically, it\u0027s smart. I saw from the get-go that Price was going to split the pro-Fields vote. No flies on Bends-Your-Ear; she\u0027s realized it too and she wants him out.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But,\u0027 said Samantha, \u0027it mightn\u0027t have anything to do with Parminder and that lot at all. It could be from someone we don\u0027t know, someone who\u0027s got a grudge against Simon Price.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, Sam,\u0027 said Shirley, with a tinkling laugh, shaking her head. \u0027It\u0027s easy to see you\u0027re new to politics.\u0027\\n\\n Oh, fuck off, Shirley.\\n\\n \u0027So why have they used Barry Fairbrother\u0027s name, then?\u0027 asked Miles, rounding on his wife.\\n\\n \u0027Well, it\u0027s on the website, isn\u0027t it? It\u0027s his vacant seat.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And who\u0027s going to trawl through the council website for that kind of information? No,\u0027 he said gravely, \u0027this is an insider.\u0027\\n\\n An insider ... Libby had once told Samantha that there could be thousands of microscopic species inside one drop of pond water. They were all perfectly ridiculous, Samantha thought, sitting here in front of Shirley\u0027s commemorative plates as if they were in the Cabinet Room in Downing Street, as though one bit of tittle-tattle on a Parish Council website constituted an organized campaign, as though any of it mattered.\\n\\n Consciously and defiantly, Samantha withdrew her attention from the lot of them. She fixed her eyes on the window and the clear evening sky beyond, and she thought about Jake, the muscular boy in Libby\u0027s favourite band. At lunchtime today, Samantha had gone out for sandwiches, and brought back a music magazine in which Jake and his bandmates were interviewed. There were lots of pictures.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s for Libby,\u0027 Samantha had told the girl who helped her in the shop.\\n\\n \u0027Wow, look at that. I wouldn\u0027t kick him out of bed for eating toast,\u0027 replied Carly, pointing at Jake, naked from the waist up, his head thrown back to reveal that thick strong neck. \u0027Oh, but he\u0027s only twenty-one, look. I\u0027m not a cradle-snatcher.\u0027\\n\\n Carly was twenty-six. Samantha did not care to subtract Jake\u0027s age from her own. She had eaten her sandwich and read the interview, and studied all the pictures. Jake with his hands on a bar above his head, biceps swelling under a black T-shirt; Jake with his white shirt open, abdominal muscles chiselled above the loose waistband of his jeans.\\n\\n Samantha drank Howard\u0027s wine and stared out at the sky above the black privet hedge, which was a delicate shade of rose pink; the precise shade her nipples had been before they had been darkened and distended by pregnancy and breast-feeding. She imagined herself nineteen to Jake\u0027s twenty-one, slender-waisted again, taut curves in the right places, and a strong flat stomach of her own, fitting comfortably into her white, size ten shorts. She vividly recalled how it felt to sit on a young man\u0027s lap in those shorts, with the heat and roughness of sun-warmed denim under her bare thighs, and big hands around her lithe waist. She imagined Jake\u0027s breath on her neck; she imagined turning to look into the blue eyes, close to the high cheekbones and that firm, carved mouth ...\\n\\n \u0027... at the church hall, and we\u0027re getting it catered by Bucknoles,\u0027 said Howard. \u0027We\u0027ve invited everyone: Aubrey and Julia - everyone. With luck it will be a double celebration, you on the council, me, another year young ...\u0027\\n\\n Samantha felt tipsy and randy. When were they going to eat? She realized that Shirley had left the room, hopefully to put food on the table.\\n\\n The telephone rang at Samantha\u0027s elbow, and she jumped. Before any of them could move, Shirley had bustled back in. She had one hand in a flowery oven glove, and picked up the receiver with the other.\\n\\n \u0027Double-two-five-nine?\u0027 sang Shirley on a rising inflection. \u0027Oh ... hello, Ruth, dear!\u0027\\n\\n Howard, Miles and Maureen became rigidly attentive. Shirley turned to look at her husband with intensity, as if she were transmitting Ruth\u0027s voice through her eyes into her husband\u0027s mind.\\n\\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 fluted Shirley. \u0027Yes ...\u0027\\n\\n Samantha, sitting closest to the receiver, could hear the other woman\u0027s voice but not make out the words.\\n\\n \u0027Oh, really ...?\u0027\\n\\n Maureen\u0027s mouth was hanging open again; she was like an ancient baby bird, or perhaps a pterodactyl, hungering for regurgitated news.\\n\\n \u0027Yes, dear, I see ... oh, that shouldn\u0027t be a problem ... no, no, I\u0027ll explain to Howard. No, no trouble at all.\u0027\\n\\n Shirley\u0027s small hazel eyes had not wavered from Howard\u0027s big, popping blue ones.\\n\\n \u0027Ruth, dear,\u0027 said Shirley, \u0027Ruth, I don\u0027t want to worry you, but have you been on the council website today? ... Well ... it\u0027s not very nice, but I think you ought to know ... somebody\u0027s posted something nasty about Simon ... well, I think you\u0027d better read it for yourself, I wouldn\u0027t want to ... all right, dear. All right. See you Wednesday, I hope. Yes. Bye bye.\u0027\\n\\n Shirley replaced the receiver.\\n\\n \u0027She didn\u0027t know,\u0027 Miles stated.\\n\\n Shirley shook her head.\\n\\n \u0027Why was she calling?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Her son,\u0027 Shirley told Howard. \u0027Your new potboy. He\u0027s got a peanut allergy.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Very handy, in a delicatessen,\u0027 said Howard.\\n\\n \u0027She wanted to ask whether you could store a needleful of adrenalin in the fridge for him, just in case,\u0027 said Shirley.\\n\\n Maureen sniffed.\\n\\n \u0027They\u0027ve all got allergies these days, children.\u0027\\n\\n Shirley\u0027s ungloved hand was still clutching the receiver. She was subconsciously hoping to feel tremors down the line from Hilltop House. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-casual-vacancy/page-21.html","bookId":2230,"book":{"id":2230,"title":"The Casual Vacancy","description":"Storyline: When Barry Fairbrother dies unexpectedly in his early forties, the little town of Pagford is left in shock.
