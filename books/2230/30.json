{"id":107531,"no":30,"title":"Page 30","content":"II Parminder was not supposed to be working the next morning, but she had a meeting in Yarvil. Once the children had left for school she moved methodically around the house, making sure that she had everything she needed, but when the telephone rang, she jumped so much that she dropped her bag. \u0027Yes?\u0027 she yelped, sounding almost frightened. Tessa, on the other end of the line, was taken aback. \u0027Minda, it\u0027s me - are you all right?\u0027 \u0027Yes - yes - the phone made me jump,\u0027 said Parminder, looking at the kitchen floor now littered with keys, papers, loose change and tampons. \u0027What is it?\u0027 \u0027Nothing really,\u0027 said Tessa. \u0027Just calling for a chat. See how you are.\u0027 The subject of the anonymous post hung between them like some jeering monster, dangling from the line. Parminder had barely allowed Tessa to talk about it during yesterday\u0027s call. She had shouted, \u0027It\u0027s a lie, a filthy lie, and don\u0027t tell me Howard Mollison didn\u0027t do it!\u0027 Tessa had not dared pursue the subject. \u0027I can\u0027t talk,\u0027 said Parminder. \u0027I\u0027ve got a meeting in Yarvil. A case review for a little boy on the at-risk register.\u0027 \u0027Oh, right. Sorry. Maybe later?\u0027 \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Parminder. \u0027Great. Goodbye.\u0027 She scooped up the contents of her bag and hurried from the house, running back from the garden gate to check that she had closed the front door properly. Every so often, as she drove, she realized that she had no recollection of travelling the last mile, and told herself fiercely to concentrate. But the malicious words of the anonymous post kept coming back to her. She already knew them by heart. Parish Councillor Dr Parminder Jawanda, who pretends to be so keen on looking after the poor and needy of the area, has always had a secret motive. Until I died, she was in love with me, which she could barely hide whenever she laid eyes on me, and she would vote however I told her to, whenever there was a council meeting. Now that I am gone, she will be useless as a councillor, because she has lost her brain. She had first seen it the previous morning, when she opened up the council website to check the minutes of the last meeting. The shock had been almost physical; her breathing had become very fast and shallow, as it had been during the most excruciating parts of childbirth, when she had tried to lift herself over the pain, to disengage from the agonizing present. Everyone would know by now. There was nowhere to hide. The oddest thoughts kept coming to her. For instance, what her grandmother would have said if she had known that Parminder had been accused of loving another woman\u0027s husband, and a gora to boot, in a public forum. She could almost see bebe covering her face with a fold of her sari, shaking her head, rocking backwards and forwards as she had always done when a harsh blow had hit the family. \u0027Some husbands,\u0027 Vikram had said to her late last night, with a strange new twist to his sardonic smile, \u0027might want to know whether it was true.\u0027 \u0027Of course it isn\u0027t true!\u0027 Parminder had said, with her own shaking hand over her mouth. \u0027How can you ask me that? Of course it isn\u0027t! You knew him! He was my friend - just a friend!\u0027 She was already passing the Bellchapel Addiction Clinic. How had she travelled so far, without realizing it? She was becoming a dangerous driver. She was not paying attention. She remembered the evening that she and Vikram had gone to the restaurant, nearly twenty years ago, the night they had agreed to marry. She had told him about all the fuss the family had made when she had walked home with Stephen Hoyle, and he had agreed how silly it was. He had understood then. But he did not understand when it was Howard Mollison who accused her instead of her own hidebound relatives. Apparently he did not realise that goras could be narrow, and untruthful, and full of malice ... She had missed the turning. She must concentrate. She must pay attention. \u0027Am I late?\u0027 she called, as she hurried at last across the car park towards Kay Bawden. She had met the social worker once before, when she had come in for a renewal of her prescription for the pill. \u0027Not at all,\u0027 said Kay. \u0027I thought I\u0027d show you up to the office, because it\u0027s a rabbit warren in here ...\u0027 Kay led her down a shabby, deserted institutional corridor into a meeting room. Three more women were already sitting there; they greeted Parminder with smiles. \u0027This is Nina, who works with Robbie\u0027s mother at Bellchapel,\u0027 said Kay, sitting down with her back to the venetian-blinded windows. \u0027And this is my supervisor Gillian, and this is Louise Harper, who oversees the Anchor Road Nursery. Dr Parminder Jawanda, Robbie\u0027s GP,\u0027 Kay added. Parminder accepted coffee. The other four women began talking, without involving her. (Parish Councillor Dr Parminder Jawanda, who pretends to be so keen on looking after the poor and needy of the area ... Who pretends to be so keen. You bastard, Howard Mollison. But he had always seen her as a hypocrite; Barry had said so. \u0027He thinks that because I came from the Fields, I want Pagford overrun by Yarvillians. But you\u0027re proper professional class, so he doesn\u0027t think you\u0027ve got any right to be on the side of the Fields. He thinks you\u0027re a hypocrite or making trouble for fun.\u0027) \u0027... understand why the family\u0027s registered with a GP in Pagford?\u0027 said one of the three unfamiliar social workers, whose names Parminder had already forgotten. \u0027Several families in the Fields are registered with us,\u0027 said Parminder at once. \u0027But wasn\u0027t there some trouble with the Weedons and their previous - ?\u0027 \u0027Yeah, the Cantermill practice threw them out,\u0027 said Kay, in front of whom sat a pile of notes thicker than either of her colleagues. \u0027Terri assaulted a nurse there. So they\u0027ve been registered with you, how long?\u0027 \u0027Nearly five years,\u0027 said Parminder, who had looked up all the details at the surgery. (She had seen Howard in church, at Barry\u0027s funeral, pretending to pray, with his big fat hands clasped in front of him, and the Fawleys kneeling beside him. Parminder knew what Christians were supposed to believe in. Love thy neighbour as thyself ... if Howard had been more honest, he would have turned sideways and prayed to Aubrey ... Until I died, she was in love with me, which she could barely hide whenever she laid eyes on me ... Had she really not been able to hide it?) \u0027... last seen him, Parminder?\u0027 asked Kay. \u0027When his sister brought him in for antibiotics for an ear infection,\u0027 said Parminder. \u0027About eight weeks ago.\u0027 \u0027And how was his physical condition then?\u0027 asked one of the other women. \u0027Well, he\u0027s not failing to thrive,\u0027 said Parminder, withdrawing a slim sheaf of photocopied notes from her handbag. \u0027I checked him quite thoroughly, because - well, I know the family history. He\u0027s a good weight, although I doubt his diet\u0027s anything to write home about. No lice or nits or anything of that description. His bottom was a bit sore, and I remember his sister said that he still wets himself sometimes.\u0027 \u0027They keep putting him back in nappies,\u0027 said Kay. \u0027But you wouldn\u0027t,\u0027 asked the woman who had first questioned Parminder, \u0027have any major concerns health-wise?\u0027 \u0027There was no sign of abuse,\u0027 said Parminder. \u0027I remember, I took off his vest to check, and there were no bruises or other injuries.\u0027 \u0027There\u0027s no man in the house,\u0027 interjected Kay. \u0027And this ear infection?\u0027 her supervisor prompted Parminder. \u0027You said it was the sister who brought him in, not the mother? Are you Terri\u0027s doctor, too?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t think we\u0027ve seen Terri for five years,\u0027 said Parminder, and the supervisor turned to Nina instead. \u0027How\u0027s she doing on methadone?\u0027 (Until I died, she was in love with me ... Parminder thought, Perhaps it\u0027s Shirley, or Maureen, who\u0027s the ghost, not Howard - they would be much more likely to watch her when she was with Barry, hoping to see something with their dirty old-womanish minds ... ) \u0027... longest she\u0027s lasted on the programme so far,\u0027 said Nina. \u0027She\u0027s mentioned the case review quite a lot. I get the feeling she knows that this is it, that she\u0027s running out of chances. She doesn\u0027t want to lose Robbie. She\u0027s said that a few times. I\u0027d have to say you\u0027ve got through to her, Kay. I really do see her taking some responsibility for the situation, for the first time since I\u0027ve known her.\u0027 \u0027Thank you, but I\u0027m not going to get over-excited. The situation\u0027s still pretty precarious.\u0027 Kay\u0027s dampening words were at odds with her tiny irrepressible smile of satisfaction. \u0027How are things going at nursery, Louise?\u0027 \u0027Well, he\u0027s back again,\u0027 said the fourth social worker. \u0027He\u0027s been in full attendance for the past three weeks, which is a dramatic change. The teenage sister brings him. His clothes are too small and usually dirty, but he talks about bath and meal times at home.\u0027 \u0027And behaviourally?\u0027 \u0027He\u0027s developmentally delayed. His language skills are very poor. He doesn\u0027t like men coming into the nursery. When fathers turn up, he won\u0027t go near them; he hangs around the nursery workers and becomes very anxious. And once or twice,\u0027 she said, turning a page in her notes, \u0027he\u0027s mimicked what are clearly sexual acts on or near little girls.\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t think, whatever we decide, there can be any question of taking him off the at-risk register,\u0027 said Kay, to a murmur of agreement. \u0027It sounds like everything hinges on Terri staying on your programme,\u0027 said the supervisor to Nina, \u0027and staying off the game.\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s key, certainly,\u0027 Kay agreed, \u0027but I\u0027m concerned that even when she\u0027s heroin-free, she doesn\u0027t provide much mothering to Robbie. Krystal seems to be raising him, and she\u0027s sixteen and got plenty of her own issues ...\u0027 (Parminder remembered what she had said to Sukhvinder a couple of nights previously. Krystal Weedon! That stupid girl! Is that what being in a team with Krystal Weedon taught you - to sink to her level? Barry had liked Krystal. He had seen things in her that were invisible to other people\u0027s eyes. Once, long ago, Parminder had told Barry the story of Bhai Kanhaiya, the Sikh hero who had administered to the needs of those wounded in combat, whether friend or foe. When asked why he gave aid indiscriminately, Bhai Kanhaiya had replied that the light of God shone from every soul, and that he had been unable to distinguish between them. The light of God shone from every soul. She had called Krystal Weedon stupid and implied that she was low. Barry would never have said it. She was ashamed.) \u0027... when there was a great-grandmother who seemed to provide some back-up in care, but - \u0027 \u0027She died,\u0027 said Parminder, rushing to say it before anyone else could. \u0027Emphysema and stroke.\u0027 \u0027Yeah,\u0027 said Kay, still looking at her notes. \u0027So we go back to Terri. She came out of care herself. Has she ever attended parenting classes?\u0027 \u0027We offer them, but she\u0027s never been in a fit state to attend,\u0027 said the woman from the nursery. \u0027If she agreed to take them and actually turned up, it would be a massive step forward,\u0027 said Kay. \u0027If they close us down,\u0027 sighed Nina from Bellchapel, addressing Parminder, \u0027I suppose she\u0027ll have to come to you for her methadone.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m concerned that she wouldn\u0027t,\u0027 said Kay, before Parminder could answer. \u0027What do you mean?\u0027 asked Parminder angrily. The other women stared at her. \u0027Just that catching buses and remembering appointments isn\u0027t Terri\u0027s forte,\u0027 said Kay. \u0027She only has to walk up the road to Bellchapel.\u0027 \u0027Oh,\u0027 said Parminder, mortified. \u0027Yes. Sorry. Yes, you\u0027re probably right.\u0027 (She had thought that Kay was making a reference to the complaint about Catherine Weedon\u0027s death; that she did not think Terri Weedon would trust her. Concentrate on what they\u0027re saying. What\u0027s wrong with you?) \u0027So, big picture,\u0027 said the supervisor, looking down at her notes. \u0027We\u0027ve got neglectful parenting interspersed with some adequate care.\u0027 She sighed, but there was more exasperation than sadness in the sound. \u0027The immediate crisis is over - she\u0027s stopped using - Robbie\u0027s back in nursery, where we can keep a proper eye on him - and there\u0027s no immediate concern for his safety. As Kay says, he stays on the at-risk register ... I certainly think we\u0027ll need another meeting in four weeks ...\u0027 It was another forty minutes before the meeting broke up. Kay walked Parminder back down to the car park. \u0027It was very good of you to come in person; most GPs send through a report.\u0027 \u0027It was my morning off,\u0027 said Parminder. She meant it as an explanation for her attendance, because she hated sitting at home alone with nothing to do, but Kay seemed to think that she was asking for more praise and gave it. At Parminder\u0027s car, Kay said, \u0027You\u0027re the parish councillor, aren\u0027t you? Did Colin pass you the figures on Bellchapel I gave him?\u0027 \u0027Yes, he did,\u0027 said Parminder. \u0027It would be good to have a talk about that some time. It\u0027s on the agenda for the next meeting.\u0027 But when Kay had given her her number, and left, with renewed thanks, Parminder\u0027s thoughts reverted to Barry, the Ghost and the Mollisons. She was driving through the Fields when the simple thought that she had tried to bury, to drown out, slipped past her lowered defences at last. Perhaps I did love him.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-casual-vacancy/page-30.html","bookId":2230,"book":{"id":2230,"title":"The Casual Vacancy","description":"Storyline: When Barry Fairbrother dies unexpectedly in his early forties, the little town of Pagford is left in shock.
