When he caught sight of her, striding along the pavement alone with her hands in her pockets and her head down, Gavin made a sharp left turn, and instead of continuing along the road to Mary\u0027s, crossed the old stone bridge, and parked up a side lane on the other side of the river.\\n\\n He did not want Samantha to see him parking outside Mary\u0027s house. It did not matter on work days, when he wore a suit and carried a briefcase; it had not mattered before he had admitted to himself what he felt about Mary, but it mattered now. In any case, the morning was glorious and a walk bought him time.\\n\\n Still keeping my options open, he thought, as he crossed the bridge on foot. There was a small boy sitting by himself on a bench, eating sweets, below him. I don\u0027t have to say anything ... I\u0027ll play it by ear ...\\n\\n But his palms were wet. The thought of Gaia telling the Fairbrother twins that he was in love with their mother had haunted him all through a restless night.\\n\\n Mary seemed pleased to see him.\\n\\n \u0027Where\u0027s your car?\u0027 she asked, peering over his shoulder.\\n\\n \u0027Parked it down by the river,\u0027 he said. \u0027Lovely morning. I fancied a walk, and then it occurred to me that I could mow the lawn if you - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, Graham did it for me,\u0027 she said, \u0027but that\u0027s so sweet of you. Come in and have a coffee.\u0027\\n\\n She chatted as she moved around the kitchen. She was wearing old cut-off jeans and a T-shirt; they showed how thin she was, but her hair was shiny again, the way he usually thought of it. He could see the twin girls, lying out on the freshly mown lawn on a blanket, both with headphones in, listening to their iPods.\\n\\n \u0027How are you?\u0027 Mary asked, sitting down beside him.\\n\\n He could not think why she sounded so concerned; then he remembered that he had found time to tell her, yesterday, during his brief visit, that he and Kay had split up.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m OK,\u0027 he said. \u0027Probably for the best.\u0027\\n\\n She smiled and patted his arm.\\n\\n \u0027I heard last night,\u0027 he said, his mouth a little dry, \u0027that you might be moving.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027News travels fast in Pagford,\u0027 she said. \u0027It\u0027s just an idea. Theresa wants me to move back to Liverpool.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And how do the kids feel about that?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, I\u0027d wait for the girls and Fergus to do their exams in June. Declan\u0027s not so much of a problem. I mean, none of us wants to leave ...\u0027\\n\\n She melted into tears in front of him, but he was so happy that he reached out to touch her delicate wrist.\\n\\n \u0027Of course you don\u0027t ...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027... Barry\u0027s grave.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Ah,\u0027 said Gavin, his happiness snuffed out like a candle.\\n\\n Mary wiped her streaming eyes on the back of her hand. Gavin found her a little morbid. His family cremated their dead. Barry\u0027s burial had only been the second he had ever attended, and he had hated everything about it. Gavin saw a grave purely as a marker for the place where a corpse was decomposing; a nasty thought, yet people took it into their heads to visit and bring flowers, as though it might yet recover.\\n\\n She had got up to get tissues. Outside on the lawn, the twins had switched to sharing a set of headphones, their heads bobbing up and down in time to the same song.\\n\\n \u0027So Miles got Barry\u0027s seat,\u0027 she said. \u0027I could hear the celebrations all the way up here last night.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, it was Howard\u0027s ... yeah, that\u0027s right,\u0027 said Gavin.\\n\\n \u0027And Pagford\u0027s nearly rid of the Fields,\u0027 she said.\\n\\n \u0027Yeah, looks like it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027And now Miles is on the council, it\u0027ll be easier to close Bellchapel,\u0027 she said.\\n\\n Gavin always had to remind himself what Bellchapel was; he had no interest in these issues at all.\\n\\n \u0027Yeah, I suppose so.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So everything Barry wanted is finished,\u0027 she said.\\n\\n Her tears had dried up, and the patches of high angry colour had returned to her cheeks.\\n\\n \u0027I know,\u0027 he said. \u0027It\u0027s really sad.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 she said, still flushed and angry. \u0027Why should Pagford pick up the bills for the Fields? Barry only ever saw one side of it. He thought everyone in the Fields was like him. He thought Krystal Weedon was like him, but she wasn\u0027t. It never occurred to him that people in the Fields might be happy where they are.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yeah,\u0027 said Gavin, overjoyed that she disagreed with Barry, and feeling as if the shadow of his grave had lifted from between them, \u0027I know what you mean. From all I\u0027ve heard about Krystal Weedon - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027She got more of his time and his attention than his own daughters,\u0027 said Mary. \u0027And she never even gave a penny for his wreath. The girls told me. The whole rowing team chipped in, except Krystal. And she didn\u0027t come to his funeral, even, after all he\u0027d done for her.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yeah, well, that shows - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m sorry, but I can\u0027t stop thinking about it all,\u0027 she said frenetically. \u0027I can\u0027t stop thinking that he\u0027d still want me to worry about bloody Krystal Weedon. I can\u0027t get past it. All the last day of his life, and he had a headache and he didn\u0027t do anything about it, writing that bloody article!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I know,\u0027 said Gavin. \u0027I know. I think,\u0027 he said, with a sense of putting his foot tentatively on an old rope bridge, \u0027it\u0027s a bloke thing. Miles is the same. Samantha didn\u0027t want him to stand for the council, but he went ahead anyway. You know, some men really like a bit of power - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027Barry wasn\u0027t in it for power,\u0027 said Mary, and Gavin hastily retreated.\\n\\n \u0027No, no, Barry wasn\u0027t. He was in it for - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027He couldn\u0027t help himself,\u0027 she said. \u0027He thought everyone was like him, that if you gave them a hand they\u0027d start bettering themselves.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yeah,\u0027 said Gavin, \u0027but the point is, there are other people who could use a hand - people at home ...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, exactly!\u0027 said Mary, dissolving yet again into tears.\\n\\n \u0027Mary,\u0027 said Gavin, leaving his chair, moving to her side (on the rope bridge now, with a sense of mingled panic and anticipation), \u0027look ... it\u0027s really early ... I mean, it\u0027s far too soon ... but you\u0027ll meet someone else.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027At forty,\u0027 sobbed Mary, \u0027with four children ...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Plenty of men,\u0027 he began, but that was no good; he would rather she did not think she had too many options. \u0027The right man,\u0027 he corrected himself, \u0027won\u0027t care that you\u0027ve got kids. Anyway, they\u0027re such nice kids ... anyone would be glad to take them on.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, Gavin, you\u0027re so sweet,\u0027 she said, dabbing her eyes again.\\n\\n He put his arm around her, and she did not shrug it off. They stood without speaking while she blew her nose, and then he felt her tense to move away, and he said, \u0027Mary ...\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve got to - Mary, I think I\u0027m in love with you.\u0027\\n\\n He knew for a few seconds the glorious pride of the skydiver who pushes off firm floor into limitless space.\\n\\n Then she pulled away.\\n\\n \u0027Gavin. I - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m sorry,\u0027 he said, observing with alarm her repulsed expression. \u0027I wanted you to hear it from me. I told Kay that\u0027s why I wanted to split up, and I was scared you\u0027d hear it from someone else. I wouldn\u0027t have said anything for months. Years,\u0027 he added, trying to bring back her smile and the mood in which she found him sweet.\\n\\n But Mary was shaking her head, arms folded over her thin chest.\\n\\n \u0027Gavin, I never, ever - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027Forget I said anything,\u0027 he said foolishly. \u0027Let\u0027s just forget it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I thought you understood,\u0027 she said.\\n\\n He gathered that he should have known that she was encased in the invisible armour of grief, and that it ought to have protected her.\\n\\n \u0027I do understand,\u0027 he lied. \u0027I wouldn\u0027t have told you, only - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027Barry always said you fancied me,\u0027 said Mary.\\n\\n \u0027I didn\u0027t,\u0027 he said frantically.\\n\\n \u0027Gavin, I think you\u0027re such a nice man,\u0027 she said breathlessly. \u0027But I don\u0027t - I mean, even if - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 he said loudly, trying to drown her out. \u0027I understand. Listen, I\u0027m going to go.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027There\u0027s no need ...\u0027\\n\\n But he almost hated her now. He had heard what she was trying to say: even if I weren\u0027t grieving for my husband, I wouldn\u0027t want you.\\n\\n His visit had been so brief that when Mary, slightly shaky, poured away his coffee it was still hot. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-casual-vacancy/page-48.html","bookId":2230,"book":{"id":2230,"title":"The Casual Vacancy","description":"Storyline: When Barry Fairbrother dies unexpectedly in his early forties, the little town of Pagford is left in shock.
