{"id":107529,"no":28,"title":"Page 28","content":"XI\n Krystal did not take Robbie to nursery on Tuesday morning, but dressed him for Nana Cath\u0027s funeral instead. As she pulled up his least ripped trousers, which were a good two inches too short in the leg, she tried to explain to him who Nana Cath had been, but she might as well have saved her breath. Robbie had no memory of Nana Cath; he had no idea what Nana meant; no concept of any relative other than mother and sister. In spite of her shifting hints and stories, Krystal knew that Terri had no idea who his father was.\n Krystal heard her mother\u0027s footsteps on the stairs.\n \u0027Leave it,\u0027 she snapped at Robbie, who had reached for an empty beer can lying beneath Terri\u0027s usual armchair. \u0027C\u0027m\u0027ere.\u0027\n She pulled Robbie by the hand into the hall. Terri was still wearing the pyjama bottoms and dirty T-shirt in which she had spent the night, and her feet were bare.\n \u0027Why intcha changed?\u0027 demanded Krystal.\n \u0027I ain\u0027t goin\u0027,\u0027 said Terri, pushing past her son and daughter into the kitchen. \u0027Changed me mind.\u0027\n \u0027Why?\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027 wanna,\u0027 said Terri. She was lighting a cigarette off the ring of the cooker. \u0027Don\u0027 fuckin\u0027 \u0027ave to.\u0027\n Krystal was still holding Robbie\u0027s hand, as he tugged and swung.\n \u0027They\u0027re all goin\u0027,\u0027 said Krystal. \u0027Cheryl an\u0027 Shane an\u0027 all.\u0027\n \u0027So?\u0027 said Terri aggressively.\n Krystal had been afraid that her mother would pull out at the last minute. The funeral would bring her face to face with Danielle, the sister who pretended that Terri did not exist, not to mention all the other relatives who had disowned them. Anne-Marie might be there. Krystal had been holding on to that hope, like a torch in the darkness, through the nights she had sobbed for Nana Cath and Mr Fairbrother.\n \u0027You gotta go,\u0027 said Krystal.\n \u0027No, I ain\u0027.\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027s Nana Cath, innit,\u0027 said Krystal.\n \u0027So?\u0027 said Terri, again.\n \u0027She done loads fer us,\u0027 said Krystal.\n \u0027No, she ain\u0027,\u0027 snapped Terri.\n \u0027She did,\u0027 said Krystal, her face hot and her hand clutching Robbie\u0027s.\n \u0027Fer you, maybe,\u0027 said Terri. \u0027She done fuck-all for me. Go an\u0027 fuckin\u0027 bawl all over \u0027er fuckin\u0027 grave if yeh want. I\u0027m waitin\u0027 in.\u0027\n \u0027Wha\u0027 for?\u0027 said Krystal.\n \u0027My bus\u0027ness, innit.\u0027\n The old familiar shadow fell.\n \u0027Obbo\u0027s comin\u0027 round, is \u0027e?\u0027\n \u0027My bus\u0027ness,\u0027 repeated Terri, with pathetic dignity.\n \u0027Come to the funeral,\u0027 said Krystal loudly.\n \u0027You go.\u0027\n \u0027Don\u0027 go fuckin\u0027 usin\u0027,\u0027 said Krystal, her voice an octave higher.\n \u0027I ain\u0027,\u0027 said Terri, but she turned away, looking out of the dirty back window over the patch of overgrown litter-strewn grass they called the back garden.\n Robbie tugged his hand out of Krystal\u0027s and disappeared into the sitting room. With her fists deep in her trackie pockets, shoulders squared, Krystal tried to decide what to do. She wanted to cry at the thought of not going to the funeral, but her distress was edged with relief that she would not have to face the battery of hostile eyes she had sometimes met at Nana Cath\u0027s. She was angry with Terri, and yet felt strangely on her side. You don\u0027t even know who the father is, do yeh, yer whore? She wanted to meet Anne-Marie, but was scared.\n \u0027All righ\u0027, then, I\u0027ll stay an\u0027 all.\u0027\n \u0027You don\u0027 \u0027ave ter. Go, if yeh wan\u0027. I don\u0027 fuckin\u0027 care.\u0027\n But Krystal, certain that Obbo would appear, stayed. Obbo had been away for more than a week, for some nefarious purpose of his own. Krystal wished that he had died, that he would never come back.\n For something to do, she began to tidy the house, while smoking one of the roll-ups Fats Wall had given her. She didn\u0027t like them, but she liked that he had given them to her. She had been keeping them in Nikki\u0027s plastic jewellery box, along with Tessa\u0027s watch.\n She had thought that she might not see Fats any more, after their shag in the cemetery, because he had been almost silent afterwards and left her with barely a goodbye, but they had since met up on the rec. She could tell that he had enjoyed this time more than the last; they had not been stoned, and he had lasted longer. He lay beside her in the grass beneath the bushes, smoking, and when she had told him about Nana Cath dying, he had told her that Sukhvinder Jawanda\u0027s mother had given Nana Cath the wrong drugs or something; he was not clear exactly what had happened.\n Krystal had been horrified. So Nana Cath need not have died; she might still have been in the neat little house on Hope Street, there in case Krystal needed her, offering a refuge with a comfortable clean-sheeted bed, the tiny kitchen full of food and mismatched china, and the little TV in the corner of the sitting room: I don\u0027 wanna watch no filth, Krystal, turn that off.\n Krystal had liked Sukhvinder, but Sukhvinder\u0027s mother had killed Nana Cath. You did not differentiate between members of an enemy tribe. It had been Krystal\u0027s avowed intention to pulverize Sukhvinder; but then Tessa Wall had intervened. Krystal could not remember the details of what Tessa had told her; but it seemed that Fats had got the story wrong or, at least, not exactly right. She had given Tessa a grudging promise not to go after Sukhvinder, but such promises could only ever be stop-gaps in Krystal\u0027s frantic ever-changing world.\n \u0027Put it down!\u0027 Krystal shouted at Robbie, because he was trying to prise the lid off the biscuit tin where Terri kept her works.\n Krystal snatched the tin from him and held it in her hands like a living creature, something that would fight to stay alive, whose destruction would have tremendous consequences. There was a scratched picture on the lid: a carriage with luggage piled high on the roof, drawn through the snow by four chestnut horses, a coachman in a top hat carrying a bugle. She carried the tin upstairs with her, while Terri sat in the kitchen smoking, and hid it in her bedroom. Robbie trailed after her.\n \u0027Wanna go play park.\u0027\n She sometimes took him and pushed him on the swings and the roundabout.\n \u0027Not today, Robbie.\u0027\n He whined until she shouted at him to shut up.\n Later, when it was dark - after Krystal had made Robbie his tea of spaghetti hoops and given him a bath; when the funeral was long since over - Obbo rapped on the front door. Krystal saw him from Robbie\u0027s bedroom window and tried to get there first, but Terri beat her to it.\n \u0027All righ\u0027, Ter?\u0027 he said, over the threshold before anyone had invited him in. \u0027\u0027Eard you was lookin\u0027 fer me las\u0027 week.\u0027\n Although she had told him to stay put, Robbie had followed Krystal downstairs. She could smell his shampooed hair over the smell of fags and stale sweat that clung to Obbo in his ancient leather jacket. Obbo had had a few; when he leered at her, she smelt the beer fumes.\n \u0027All righ\u0027, Obbo?\u0027 said Terri, with the note in her voice Krystal never heard otherwise. It was conciliating, accommodating; it conceded that he had rights in their house. \u0027Where you bin, then?\u0027\n \u0027Bristol,\u0027 he said. \u0027How\u0027s you, Ter?\u0027\n \u0027She don\u0027 wan\u0027 nuthin\u0027,\u0027 said Krystal.\n He blinked at her through his thick glasses. Robbie was clutching Krystal\u0027s leg so tightly that she could feel his nails in her skin.\n \u0027Oo\u0027s this, Ter?\u0027 asked Obbo. \u0027Yer mum?\u0027\n Terri laughed. Krystal glared at him, Robbie\u0027s grip tight on her thigh. Obbo\u0027s bleary gaze dropped to him.\n \u0027An\u0027 \u0027ow\u0027s me boy?\u0027\n \u0027He ain\u0027 your fuckin\u0027 boy,\u0027 said Krystal.\n \u0027\u0027Ow d\u0027you know?\u0027 Obbo asked her quietly, grinning.\n \u0027Fuck off. She don\u0027 wan\u0027 nuthin\u0027. Tell \u0027im,\u0027 Krystal virtually shouted at Terri. \u0027Tell \u0027im you don\u0027 wan\u0027 nuthin\u0027.\u0027\n Daunted, caught between two wills much stronger than her own, Terri said, \u0027\u0027E on\u0027y come rounda see - \u0027\n \u0027No, \u0027e ain\u0027t,\u0027 said Krystal. \u0027No, \u0027e fuckin\u0027 ain\u0027t. Tell \u0027im. She don\u0027 wan\u0027 nuthin\u0027,\u0027 she said fiercely into Obbo\u0027s grinning face. \u0027She\u0027s bin off it fer weeks.\u0027\n \u0027Is tha\u0027 right, Terri?\u0027 said Obbo, still smiling.\n \u0027Yeah, it is,\u0027 said Krystal, when Terri did not answer. \u0027She\u0027s still at Bellchapel.\u0027\n \u0027Noffur much longer,\u0027 said Obbo.\n \u0027Fuck off,\u0027 said Krystal, outraged.\n \u0027Closin\u0027 it,\u0027 said Obbo.\n \u0027Are they?\u0027 said Terri in sudden panic. \u0027They ain\u0027t, are they?\u0027\n \u0027Course they are,\u0027 said Obbo. \u0027Cuts, innit?\u0027\n \u0027You don\u0027t know nuthin\u0027,\u0027 Krystal told Obbo. \u0027It\u0027s bollocks,\u0027 she told her mother. \u0027They \u0027aven\u0027 said nuthin\u0027, \u0027ave they?\u0027\n \u0027Cuts,\u0027 repeated Obbo, patting his bulging pockets for cigarettes.\n \u0027We got the case review,\u0027 Krystal reminded Terri. \u0027Yeh can\u0027t use. Yeh can\u0027t.\u0027\n \u0027Wha\u0027s that?\u0027 asked Obbo, fiddling with his lighter, but neither woman enlightened him. Terri met her daughter\u0027s gaze for a bare two seconds; her eyes fell, reluctantly, to Robbie in his pyjamas, still clinging tightly to Krystal\u0027s leg.\n \u0027Yeah, I wuz gonna go ter bed, Obbo,\u0027 she mumbled, without looking at him. \u0027I\u0027ll mebbe see yer another time.\u0027\n \u0027I \u0027eard your Nan died,\u0027 he said. \u0027Cheryl wuz tellin\u0027 me.\u0027\n Pain contorted Terri\u0027s face; she looked as old as Nana Cath herself.\n \u0027Yeah, I\u0027m goin\u0027 ter bed. C\u0027mon, Robbie. Come wi\u0027 me, Robbie.\u0027\n Robbie did not want to let go of Krystal while Obbo was still there. Terri held out her claw-like hand.\n \u0027Yeah, go on, Robbie,\u0027 Krystal urged him. In certain moods, Terri clutched her son like a teddy bear; better Robbie than smack. \u0027Go on. Go wi\u0027 Mum.\u0027\n He was reassured by something in Krystal\u0027s voice, and allowed Terri to take him upstairs.\n \u0027See yeh,\u0027 said Krystal, without looking at Obbo, but stalking away from him into the kitchen, pulling the last of Fats Wall\u0027s roll-ups out of her pocket and bending to light it off the gas ring. She heard the front door close and felt triumphant. Fuck him.\n \u0027You got a lovely arse, Krystal.\u0027\n She jumped so violently that a plate slipped off the heaped side and smashed on the filthy floor. He had not gone, but had followed her. He was staring at her chest in its tight T-shirt.\n \u0027Fuck off,\u0027 she said.\n \u0027Big girl, intcha?\u0027\n \u0027Fuck off.\u0027\n \u0027I \u0027eard you give it away free,\u0027 said Obbo, closing in. \u0027You could make better money\u0027n yer mum.\u0027\n \u0027Fuck - \u0027\n His hand was on her left breast. She tried to knock it away; he seized her wrist in his other hand. Her lit cigarette grazed his face and he punched her, twice, to the side of the head; more plates shattered on the filthy floor and then, as they wrestled, she slipped and fell; the back of her head smacked on the floor, and he was on top of her: she could feel his hand at the waistband of her tracksuit bottoms, pulling.\n \u0027No - fuck - no!\u0027\n His knuckles in her belly as he undid his own flies - she tried to scream and he smacked her across the face - the smell of him was thick in her nostrils as he growled in her ear, \u0027Fuckin\u0027 shout and I\u0027ll cut yer.\u0027\n He was inside her and it hurt; she could hear him grunting and her own tiny whimper; she was ashamed of the noise she made, so frightened and so small.\n He came and clambered off her. At once she pulled up her tracksuit bottoms and jumped up to face him, tears pouring down her face as he leered at her.\n \u0027I\u0027ll tell Mist\u0027 Fairbrother,\u0027 she heard herself sob. She did not know where it came from. It was a stupid thing to say.\n \u0027The fuck\u0027s he?\u0027 Obbo tugged up his flies, lit a cigarette, taking his time, blocking her exit. \u0027You fuckin\u0027 \u0027im too, are yeh? Little slapper.\u0027\n He sauntered up the hall and was gone.\n She was shaking as she had never done in her life. She thought she might be sick; she could smell him all over her. The back of her head throbbed; there was a pain inside her, and wetness seeping into her pants. She ran out of the room into the living room and stood, shivering, with her arms wrapped around herself; then she knew a moment of terror, that he would come back, and hurried to the front door to lock it.\n Back in the sitting room she found a long stub in the ashtray and lit it. Smoking, shaking and sobbing, she sank into Terri\u0027s usual chair, then jumped up because she heard footsteps on the stairs: Terri had reappeared, looking confused and wary.\n \u0027Wha\u0027ssa matter with you?\u0027\n Krystal gagged on the words.\n \u0027He jus\u0027 - he jus\u0027 fucked me.\u0027\n \u0027Wha\u0027?\u0027 said Terri.\n \u0027Obbo - \u0027e jus\u0027 - \u0027\n \u0027\u0027E wouldn\u0027.\u0027\n It was the instinctive denial with which Terri met all of life: he wouldn\u0027t, no, I never, no, I didn\u0027t.\n Krystal flew at her and pushed her; emaciated as she was, Terri crumpled backwards into the hall, shrieking and swearing; Krystal ran to the door she had just locked, fumbled to unfasten it and wrenched it open.\n Still sobbing, she was twenty yards along the dark street before she realized that Obbo might be waiting out here, watching. She cut across a neighbour\u0027s garden at a run and took a zig-zag route through back ways in the direction of Nikki\u0027s house, and all the time the wetness spread in her pants and she thought she might throw up.\n Krystal knew that it was rape, what he had done. It had happened to Leanne\u0027s older sister in the car park of a nightclub in Bristol. Some people would have gone to the police, she knew that; but you did not invite the police into your life when your mother was Terri Weedon.\n I\u0027ll tell Mist\u0027 Fairbrother.\n Her sobs came faster and faster. She could have told Mr Fairbrother. He had known what real life was like. One of his brothers had done time. He had told Krystal stories of his youth. It had not been like her youth - nobody was as low as her, she knew that - but like Nikki\u0027s, like Leanne\u0027s. Money had run out; his mother had bought her council house and then been unable to keep up the payments; they had lived for a while in a caravan lent by an uncle.\n Mr Fairbrother took care of things; he sorted things out. He had come to their house and talked to Terri about Krystal and rowing, because there had been an argument and Terri was refusing to sign forms for Krystal to go away with the team. He had not been disgusted, or he had not shown it, which came to the same thing. Terri, who liked and trusted nobody, had said, \u0027\u0027E seems all righ\u0027,\u0027 and she had signed.\n Mr Fairbrother had once said to her, \u0027It\u0027ll be tougher for you than these others, Krys; it was tougher for me. But you can do better. You don\u0027t have to go the same way.\u0027\n He had meant working hard at school and stuff, but it was too late for that and, anyway, it was all bollocks. How would reading help her now?\n \u0027Ow\u0027s me boy?\n He ain\u0027 your fuckin\u0027 boy.\n \u0027Ow d\u0027you know?\n Leanne\u0027s sister had had to get the morning-after pill. Krystal would ask Leanne about the pill and go and get it. She could not have Obbo\u0027s baby. The thought of it made her retch.\n I gotta get out of here.\n She thought fleetingly of Kay, and then discarded her: as bad as the police, to tell a social worker that Obbo walked in and out of their house, raping people. She would take Robbie for sure, if she knew that.\n A clear lucid voice in Krystal\u0027s head was speaking to Mr Fairbrother, who was the only adult who had ever talked to her the way she needed, unlike Mrs Wall, so well-intentioned and so blinkered, and Nana Cath, refusing to hear the whole truth.\n I gotta get Robbie out of here. How can I get away? I gotta get away.\n Her one sure refuge, the little house in Hope Street, was already being gobbled up by squabbling relatives ...\n She scurried around a corner underneath a street lamp, looking over her shoulder in case he was watching her, following.\n And then the answer came to her, as though Mr Fairbrother had shown her the way.\n If she got knocked up by Fats Wall, she would be able to get her own place from the council. She would be able to take Robbie to live with her and the baby if Terri used again. And Obbo would never enter her house, not ever. There would be bolts and chains and locks on the door, and her house would be clean, always clean, like Nana Cath\u0027s house.\n Half running along the dark street, Krystal\u0027s sobs slowed and subsided.\n The Walls would probably give her money. They were like that. She could imagine Tessa\u0027s plain, concerned face, bending over a cot. Krystal would have their grandchild.\n She would lose Fats in getting pregnant; they always went, once you were expecting; she had watched it happen nearly every time in the Fields. But perhaps he would be interested; he was so strange. It did not much matter to her either way. Her interest in him, except as the essential component in her plan, had dwindled to almost nothing. What she wanted was the baby: the baby was more than a means to an end. She liked babies; she had always loved Robbie. She would keep the two of them safe, together; she would be like a better, kinder, younger Nana Cath to her family.\n Anne-Marie might come and visit, once she was away from Terri. Their children would be cousins. A very vivid image of herself and Anne-Marie came to Krystal; they were standing at the school gates of St Thomas\u0027s in Pagford, waving off two little girls in pale blue dresses and ankle socks.\n The lights were on in Nikki\u0027s house, as they always were. Krystal broke into a run. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-casual-vacancy/page-28.html","bookId":2230,"book":{"id":2230,"title":"The Casual Vacancy","description":"Storyline: \n When Barry Fairbrother dies unexpectedly in his early forties, the little town of Pagford is left in shock.
