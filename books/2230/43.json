{"id":107542,"no":43,"title":"Page 43","content":"V Krystal was walking along Foley Road in the early morning sunlight, eating a banana. It was an unfamiliar taste and texture, and she could not make up her mind whether she liked it or not. Terri and Krystal never bought fruit. Nikki\u0027s mother had just turfed her unceremoniously out of the house. \u0027We got things to do, Krystal,\u0027 she had said. \u0027We\u0027re going to Nikki\u0027s gran\u0027s for dinner.\u0027 As an afterthought, she had handed Krystal the banana to eat for breakfast. Krystal had left without protest. There was barely enough room for Nikki\u0027s family around the kitchen table. The Fields were not improved by sunshine, which merely showed up the dirt and the damage, the cracks in the concrete walls, the boarded windows and the litter. The Square in Pagford looked freshly painted whenever the sun shone. Twice a year, the primary school children had walked through the middle of town, crocodile fashion, on their way to church for Christmas and Easter services. (Nobody had ever wanted to hold Krystal\u0027s hand. Fats had told them all that she had fleas. She wondered whether he remembered.) There had been hanging baskets full of flowers; splashes of purple, pink and green, and every time Krystal had passed one of the planted troughs outside the Black Canon, she had pulled off a petal. Each one had been cool and slippery in her fingers, swiftly becoming slimy and brown as she clutched it, and she usually wiped it off on the underside of a warm wooden pew in St Michael\u0027s. She let herself into her house and saw at once, through the open door to her left, that Terri had not gone to bed. She was sitting in her armchair with her eyes closed and her mouth open. Krystal closed the door with a snap, but Terri did not stir. Krystal was at Terri\u0027s side in four strides, shaking her thin arm. Terri\u0027s head fell forwards onto her shrunken chest. She snored. Krystal let go of her. The vision of a dead man in the bathroom swam back into her subconscious. \u0027Silly bitch,\u0027 she said. Then it occurred to her that Robbie was not there. She pounded up the stairs, shouting for him. \u0027\u0027M\u0027ere,\u0027 she heard him say, from behind her own closed bedroom door. When she shouldered it open, she saw Robbie standing there, naked. Behind him, scratching his bare chest, lying on her own mattress, was Obbo. \u0027All righ\u0027, Krys?\u0027 he said, grinning. She seized Robbie and pulled him into his own room. Her hands trembled so badly that it took her ages to dress him. \u0027Did \u0027e do somethin\u0027 to yer?\u0027 she whispered to Robbie. \u0027\u0027M\u0027ungry,\u0027 said Robbie. When he was dressed, she picked him up and ran downstairs. She could hear Obbo moving around in her bedroom. \u0027Why\u0027s \u0027e \u0027ere?\u0027 she shouted at Terri, who was drowsily awake in her chair. \u0027Why\u0027s \u0027e with Robbie?\u0027 Robbie fought to get out of her arms; he hated shouting. \u0027An\u0027 wha\u0027 the fuck\u0027s that?\u0027 screamed Krystal, spotting, for the first time, two black holdalls lying beside Terri\u0027s armchair. \u0027S\u0027nuthin\u0027,\u0027 said Terri vaguely. But Krystal had already forced one of the zips open. \u0027S\u0027nuthin\u0027!\u0027 shouted Terri. Big, brick-like blocks of hashish wrapped neatly in sheets of polythene: Krystal, who could barely read, who could not have identified half the vegetables in a supermarket, who could not have named the Prime Minister, knew that the contents of the bag, if discovered on the premises, meant prison for her mother. Then she saw the tin, with the coachman and horses on the lid, half-protruding from the chair on which Terri was sitting. \u0027Yeh\u0027ve used,\u0027 said Krystal breathlessly, as disaster rained invisibly around her and everything collapsed. \u0027Yeh\u0027ve fuckin\u0027 - \u0027 She heard Obbo on the stairs and she snatched up Robbie again. He wailed and struggled in her arms, frightened by her anger, but Krystal\u0027s grip was unbreakable. \u0027Fuckin\u0027 lerrim go,\u0027 called Terri fruitlessly. Krystal had opened the front door and was running as fast as she could, encumbered by Robbie who was resisting and moaning, back along the road.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-casual-vacancy/page-43.html","bookId":2230,"book":{"id":2230,"title":"The Casual Vacancy","description":"Storyline: When Barry Fairbrother dies unexpectedly in his early forties, the little town of Pagford is left in shock.
