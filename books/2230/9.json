{"id":107510,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"II\n Edward Collins \u0026 Co., the Pagford solicitors, occupied the upper floor of a terraced brick house, with an optician\u0027s on the ground floor. Edward Collins was deceased and his firm comprised two men: Gavin Hughes who was the salaried partner, with one window in his office, and Miles Mollison, who was the equity partner, with two windows. They shared a secretary who was twenty-eight, single, plain but with a good figure. Shona laughed too long at all Miles\u0027 jokes, and treated Gavin with a patronage that was almost offensive.\n \u0027Mary\u0027s called. There\u0027s a bit of a glitch with Barry\u0027s life insurance. She wants me to help her sort it.\u0027\n \u0027Right, well, you can handle that, can\u0027t you? I\u0027ll be back at two, anyway.\u0027\n Miles slipped on his overcoat, jogged down the steep stairs and walked briskly up the rain-swept little street that led to the Square. A momentary break in the clouds caused sunlight to flood the glistening war memorial and the hanging baskets. Miles experienced a rush of atavistic pride as he hurried across the Square towards Mollison and Lowe, that Pagford institution, that classiest of emporia; a pride that familiarity had never blighted, but rather deepened and ripened.\n The bell tinkled at the door as Miles pushed it open. There was something of a lunchtime rush on: a queue of eight waited at the counter and Howard, in his mercantile regalia, fisherman\u0027s flies glinting in his deerstalker, was in full tongue.\n \u0027... and a quarter of black olives, Rosemary, to you. Nothing else, now? Nothing else for Rosemary ... that\u0027ll be eight pounds, sixty-two pence; we\u0027ll call it eight, my love, in light of our long and fruitful association ...\u0027\n Giggles and gratitude; the rattle and crash of the till.\n \u0027And here\u0027s my lawyer, come to check up on me,\u0027 boomed Howard, winking and chuckling over the heads of the queue at Miles. \u0027If you\u0027ll wait for me in the back, sir, I\u0027ll try not to say anything incriminating to Mrs Howson ...\u0027\n Miles smiled at the middle-aged ladies, who beamed back. Tall, with thick, close-cropped greying hair, big round blue eyes, his paunch disguised by his dark overcoat, Miles was a reasonably attractive addition to the hand-baked biscuits and local cheeses. He navigated his way carefully between the little tables piled high with delicacies and paused at the big arch hewn between delicatessen and the old shoe shop, which was denuded of its protective plastic curtain for the first time. Maureen (Miles recognized the handwriting) had put up a sign on a sandwich board in the middle of the arch: No Entry. Coming Soon ... The Copper Kettle. Miles peered through into the clean, spare space that would soon be Pagford\u0027s newest and best cafe; it was plastered and painted, with freshly varnished black boards underfoot.\n He sidled around the corner of the counter and edged past Maureen, who was operating the meat slicer, affording her the opportunity for a gruff and ribald laugh, then ducked through the door that led into the dingy little back room. Here was a Formica table, on which Maureen\u0027s Daily Mail lay folded; Howard and Maureen\u0027s coats hanging on hooks, and a door leading to the lavatory, which exuded a scent of artificial lavender. Miles hung up his overcoat and drew up an old chair to the table.\n Howard appeared a minute or two later, bearing two heaped plates of delicatessen fare.\n \u0027Definitely decided on the \"Copper Kettle\" then?\u0027 asked Miles.\n \u0027Well, Mo likes it,\u0027 said Howard, setting down a plate in front of his son.\n He lumbered out, returned with two bottles of ale, and closed the door with his foot so that the room was enveloped in a windowless gloom relieved only by the dim pendant light. Howard sat down with a deep grunt. He had been conspiratorial on the telephone mid-morning, and kept Miles waiting a few moments longer while he flipped off the lid of one bottle.\n \u0027Wall\u0027s sent his forms in,\u0027 he said at last, handing over the beer.\n \u0027Ah,\u0027 said Miles.\n \u0027I\u0027m going to set a deadline. Two weeks from today for everyone to declare.\u0027\n \u0027Fair enough,\u0027 said Miles.\n \u0027Mum reckons this Price bloke is still interested. Have you asked Sam if she knows who he is yet?\u0027\n \u0027No,\u0027 said Miles.\n Howard scratched an underfold of the belly that rested close to his knees as he sat on the creaking chair.\n \u0027Everything all right with you and Sam?\u0027\n Miles admired, as always, his father\u0027s almost psychic intuition.\n \u0027Not great.\u0027\n He would not have confessed it to his mother, because he tried not to fuel the constant cold war between Shirley and Samantha, in which he was both hostage and prize.\n \u0027She doesn\u0027t like the idea of me standing,\u0027 Miles elaborated. Howard raised his fair eyebrows, his jowls wobbling as he chewed. \u0027I don\u0027t bloody know what\u0027s got into her. She\u0027s on one of her anti-Pagford kicks.\u0027\n Howard took his time swallowing. He dabbed at his mouth with a paper napkin and burped.\n \u0027She\u0027ll come round quickly enough once you\u0027re in,\u0027 he said. \u0027The social side of it. Plenty for the wives. Functions at Sweetlove House. She\u0027ll be in her element.\u0027 He took another swig of ale and scratched his belly again.\n \u0027I can\u0027t picture this Price,\u0027 said Miles, returning to the essential point, \u0027but I\u0027ve got a feeling he had a kid in Lexie\u0027s class at St Thomas\u0027s.\u0027\n \u0027Fields-born, though, that\u0027s the thing,\u0027 said Howard. \u0027Fields-born, which could work to our advantage. Split the pro-Fields vote between him and Wall.\u0027\n \u0027Yeah,\u0027 said Miles. \u0027Makes sense.\u0027\n \u0027I haven\u0027t heard of anyone else. It\u0027s possible, once details hit the website, someone else\u0027ll come forward. But I\u0027m confident about our chances. I\u0027m confident. Aubrey called,\u0027 Howard added. There was always a touch of additional portentousness in Howard\u0027s tone when he used Aubrey Fawley\u0027s Christian name. \u0027Right behind you, goes without saying. He\u0027s back this evening. He\u0027s been in town.\u0027\n Usually, when a Pagfordian said \u0027in town\u0027, they meant \u0027in Yarvil\u0027. Howard and Shirley used the phrase, in imitation of Aubrey Fawley, to mean \u0027in London\u0027.\n \u0027He mentioned something about us all getting together for a chat. Maybe tomorrow. Might even invite us over to the house. Sam\u0027d like that.\u0027\n Miles had just taken a large bite of soda bread and liver pate, but he conveyed his agreement with an emphatic nod. He liked the idea that Aubrey Fawley was \u0027right behind\u0027 him. Samantha might jeer at his parents\u0027 thraldom to the Fawleys, but Miles noticed that on those rare occasions when Samantha came face to face with either Aubrey or Julia, her accent changed subtly and her demeanour became markedly more demure.\n \u0027Something else,\u0027 said Howard, scratching his belly again. \u0027Got an email from the Yarvil and District Gazette this morning. Asking for my views on the Fields. As chair of the Parish Council.\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027re kidding? I thought Fairbrother had stitched that one up - \u0027\n \u0027Backfired, didn\u0027t it?\u0027 said Howard, with immense satisfaction. \u0027They\u0027re going to run his article, and they want someone to argue against the following week. Give them the other side of the story. I\u0027d appreciate a hand. Lawyer\u0027s turn of phrase, and all that.\u0027\n \u0027No problem,\u0027 said Miles. \u0027We could talk about that bloody addiction clinic. That\u0027d make the point.\u0027\n \u0027Yes - very good idea - excellent.\u0027\n In his enthusiasm, he had swallowed too much at once and Miles had to bang him on the back until his coughing had subsided. At last, dabbing his watering eyes with a napkin, Howard said breathlessly, \u0027Aubrey\u0027s recommending the District cuts funding from their end, and I\u0027m going to put it to our lot that it\u0027s time to terminate the lease on the building. It wouldn\u0027t hurt to make the case in the press. How much time and money\u0027s gone into that bloody place with nothing to show for it. I\u0027ve got the figures.\u0027 Howard burped sonorously. \u0027Bloody disgraceful. Pardon me.\u0027 \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-casual-vacancy/page-9.html","bookId":2230,"book":{"id":2230,"title":"The Casual Vacancy","description":"Storyline: \n When Barry Fairbrother dies unexpectedly in his early forties, the little town of Pagford is left in shock.
