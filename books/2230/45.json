Shurrup!\u0027\\n\\n Krystal had dragged Robbie to a bus stop several streets away, so that neither Obbo nor Terri could find them. She was not sure she had enough money for the fare, but she was determined to get to Pagford. Nana Cath was gone, Mr Fairbrother was gone, but Fats Wall was there, and she needed to make a baby.\\n\\n \u0027Why wuz \u0027e in the room with yeh?\u0027 Krystal shouted at Robbie, who grizzled and did not answer.\\n\\n There was only a tiny amount of battery power left on Terri\u0027s mobile phone. Krystal called Fats\u0027 number, but it went to voicemail.\\n\\n In Church Row, Fats was busy eating toast and listening to his parents having one of their familiar, bizarre conversations in the study across the hall. It was a welcome distraction from his own thoughts. The mobile in his pocket vibrated but he did not answer it. There was nobody he wanted to talk to. It would not be Andrew. Not after last night.\\n\\n \u0027Colin, you know what you\u0027re supposed to do,\u0027 his mother was saying. She sounded exhausted. \u0027Please, Colin - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027We had dinner with them on Saturday night. The night before he died. I cooked. What if - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027Colin, you didn\u0027t put anything in the food - for God\u0027s sake, now I\u0027m doing it - I\u0027m not supposed to do this, Colin, you know I\u0027m not supposed to get into it. This is your OCD talking.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But I might\u0027ve, Tess, I suddenly thought, what if I put something - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027Then why are we alive, you, me and Mary? They did a post-mortem, Colin!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Nobody told us the details. Mary never told us. I think that\u0027s why she doesn\u0027t want to talk to me any more. She suspects.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Colin, for Christ\u0027s sake - \u0027\\n\\n Tessa\u0027s voice became an urgent whisper, too quiet to hear. Fats\u0027 mobile vibrated again. He pulled it out of his pocket. Krystal\u0027s number. He answered.\\n\\n \u0027Hiya,\u0027 said Krystal, over what sounded like a kid shouting. \u0027D\u0027you wanna meet up?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Dunno,\u0027 yawned Fats. He had been intending to go to bed.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m comin\u0027 into Pagford on the bus. We could hook up.\u0027\\n\\n Last night he had pressed Gaia Bawden into the railings outside the town hall, until she had pulled away from him and thrown up. Then she had started to berate him again, so he had left her there and walked home.\\n\\n \u0027I dunno,\u0027 he said. He felt so tired, so miserable.\\n\\n \u0027Go on,\u0027 she said.\\n\\n From the study, he heard Colin. \u0027You say that, but would it show up? What if I - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027Colin, we shouldn\u0027t be going into this - you\u0027re not supposed to take these ideas seriously.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027How can you say that to me? How can I not take it seriously? If I\u0027m responsible - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yeah, all right,\u0027 said Fats to Krystal. \u0027I\u0027ll meet you in twenty, front of the pub in the Square.\u0027 \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-casual-vacancy/page-45.html","bookId":2230,"book":{"id":2230,"title":"The Casual Vacancy","description":"Storyline: When Barry Fairbrother dies unexpectedly in his early forties, the little town of Pagford is left in shock. Pagford is, seemingly, an English idyll, with a cobbled market square and an ancient abbey, but what lies behind the pretty fade is a town at war. Rich at war with poor, teenagers at war with their parents, wives at war with their husbands, teachers at war with their pupils. Pagford is not what it first seems. And the empty seat left by Barry on the town\u0027s council soon becomes the catalyst for the biggest war the town has yet seen. Who will triumph in an election fraught with passion, duplicity and unexpected revelations? Blackly comic, thought-provoking and constantly surprising, The Casual Vacancy is J.K. Rowling\u0027s first novel for adults.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-casual-vacancy.jpg","author":"J.K.
