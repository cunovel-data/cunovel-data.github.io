{"id":107535,"no":35,"title":"Page 35","content":"VII\\n\\n It was a bright, balmy morning, and the computing lab at Winterdown Comprehensive became stuffy as lunchtime approached, the dirty windows speckling the dusty monitors with distracting spots of light. Even though there was no Fats or Gaia here to distract him, Andrew Price could not concentrate. He could think of nothing but what he had overheard his parents discussing the previous evening.\\n\\n They had been talking, quite seriously, about moving to Reading, where Ruth\u0027s sister and brother-in-law lived. With his ear turned towards the open kitchen door, Andrew had hovered in the tiny dark hall and listened: Simon, it appeared, had been offered a job, or the possibility of a job, by the uncle whom Andrew and Paul barely knew, because Simon disliked him so much.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s less money,\u0027 Simon had said.\\n\\n \u0027You don\u0027t know that. He hasn\u0027t said - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027Bound to be. And it\u0027ll be more expensive all round, living there.\u0027\\n\\n Ruth made a noncommital noise. Scarcely daring to breathe in the hall, Andrew could tell, by the mere fact that his mother was not rushing to agree with Simon, that she wanted to go.\\n\\n Andrew found it impossible to imagine his parents in any house but Hilltop House, or against any backdrop but Pagford. He had taken it for granted that they would remain there for ever. He, Andrew, would leave one day for London, but Simon and Ruth would remain rooted to the hillside like trees, until they died.\\n\\n He had crept back upstairs to his bedroom and stared out of the window at the twinkling lights of Pagford, cupped in the deep black hollow between the hills. He felt as though he had never seen the view before. Somewhere down there, Fats was smoking in his attic room, probably looking at porn on his computer. Gaia was there too, absorbed in the mysterious rites of her gender. It occurred to Andrew that she had been through this; she had been torn away from the place she knew and transplanted. They had something profoundly in common at last; there was almost melancholy pleasure in the idea that, in leaving, he would share something with her.\\n\\n But she had not caused her own displacement. With a squirming unease in his guts, he had picked up his mobile and texted Fats: Si-Pie offered job in Reading. Might take it.\\n\\n Fats had still not responded, and Andrew had not seen him all morning, because they shared none of their classes. He had not seen Fats for the previous two weekends either, because he had been working at the Copper Kettle. Their longest conversation, recently, had concerned Fats\u0027 posting about Cubby on the council website.\\n\\n \u0027I think Tessa suspects,\u0027 Fats had told Andrew casually. \u0027She keeps looking at me like she knows.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027re you gonna say?\u0027 Andrew had muttered, scared.\\n\\n He knew Fats\u0027 desire for glory and credit, and he knew Fats\u0027 passion for wielding the truth as a weapon, but he was not sure that his friend understood that his own pivotal role in the activities of the Ghost of Barry Fairbrother must never be revealed. It had never been easy to explain to Fats the reality of having Simon as a father, and, somehow, Fats was becoming more difficult to explain things to.\\n\\n When his IT teacher had passed by out of sight, Andrew looked up Reading on the internet. It was huge compared with Pagford. It had an annual music festival. It was only forty miles from London. He contemplated the train service. Perhaps he would go up to the capital at weekends, the way he currently took the bus to Yarvil. But the whole thing seemed unreal: Pagford was all he had ever known; he still could not imagine his family existing anywhere else.\\n\\n At lunchtime Andrew headed straight out of school, looking for Fats. He lit up a cigarette just out of sight of the grounds, and was delighted to hear, as he was slipping his lighter casually back into his pocket, a female voice that said, \u0027Hey\u0027. Gaia and Sukhvinder caught up with him.\\n\\n \u0027All right,\u0027 he said, blowing smoke away from Gaia\u0027s beautiful face.\\n\\n The three of them had something these days that nobody else had. Two weekends\u0027 work at the cafe had created a fragile bond between them. They knew Howard\u0027s stock phrases, and had endured Maureen\u0027s prurient interest in all of their home lives; they had smirked together at her wrinkled knees in the too-short waitress\u0027s dress and had exchanged, like traders in a foreign land, small nuggets of personal information. Thus the girls knew that Andrew\u0027s father had been sacked; Andrew and Sukhvinder knew that Gaia was working to save for a train ticket back to Hackney; and he and Gaia knew that Sukhvinder\u0027s mother hated her working for Howard Mollison.\\n\\n \u0027Where\u0027s your Fat friend?\u0027 she asked, as the three of them fell into step together.\\n\\n \u0027Dunno,\u0027 said Andrew. \u0027Haven\u0027t seen him.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No loss,\u0027 said Gaia. \u0027How many of those do you smoke a day?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t count,\u0027 said Andrew, elated by her interest. \u0027D\u0027you want one?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 said Gaia. \u0027I don\u0027t like smoking.\u0027\\n\\n He wondered instantly whether the dislike extended to kissing people who smoked. Niamh Fairbrother had not complained when he had stuck his tongue into her mouth at the school disco.\\n\\n \u0027Doesn\u0027t Marco smoke?\u0027 asked Sukhvinder.\\n\\n \u0027No, he\u0027s always in training,\u0027 said Gaia.\\n\\n Andrew had become almost inured to the thought of Marco de Luca by now. There were advantages to Gaia being safeguarded, as it were, by an allegiance beyond Pagford. The power of the photographs of them together on her Facebook page had been blunted by his familiarity with them. He did not think it was his own wishful thinking that the messages she and Marco left for each other were becoming less frequent and less friendly. He could not know what was happening by telephone or email, but he was sure that Gaia\u0027s air, when he was mentioned, was dispirited.\\n\\n \u0027Oh, there he is,\u0027 said Gaia.\\n\\n It was not the handsome Marco who had come into view, but Fats Wall, who was talking to Dane Tully outside the newsagent\u0027s.\\n\\n Sukhvinder braked, but Gaia grabbed her upper arm.\\n\\n \u0027You can walk where you like,\u0027 she said, tugging her gently onwards, her flecked green eyes narrowing as they approached the place where Fats and Dane were smoking.\\n\\n \u0027All right, Arf,\u0027 called Fats, as the three of them came close.\\n\\n \u0027Fats,\u0027 said Andrew.\\n\\n Trying to head off trouble, especially Fats bullying Sukhvinder in front of Gaia, he asked, \u0027Did you get my text?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What text?\u0027 said Fats. \u0027Oh yeah - that thing about Si? You leaving, then, are you?\u0027\\n\\n It was said with a cavalier indifference that Andrew could only attribute to the presence of Dane Tully.\\n\\n \u0027Yeah, maybe,\u0027 said Andrew.\\n\\n \u0027Where are you going?\u0027 asked Gaia.\\n\\n \u0027My old man\u0027s been offered a job in Reading,\u0027 said Andrew.\\n\\n \u0027Oh, that\u0027s where my dad lives!\u0027 said Gaia in surprise. \u0027We could hang out when I go and stay. The festival\u0027s awesome. D\u0027you wanna get a sandwich, then, Sooks?\u0027\\n\\n Andrew was so stupefied by her voluntary offer to spend time with him, that she had disappeared into the newsagent\u0027s before he could gather his wits and agree. For a moment, the dirty bus stop, the newsagent\u0027s, even Dane Tully, tattooed and shabby in a T-shirt and tracksuit bottoms, seemed to glow with an almost celestial light.\\n\\n \u0027Well, I got things to do,\u0027 said Fats.\\n\\n Dane sniggered. Before Andrew could say anything or offer to accompany him, he had loped away.\\n\\n Fats was sure that Andrew would be nonplussed and hurt by his cool attitude, and he was glad of it. Fats did not ask himself why he was glad, or why a general desire to cause pain had become his overriding emotion in the last few days. He had lately decided that questioning your own motives was inauthentic; a refinement of his personal philosophy that had made it altogether easier to follow.\\n\\n As he headed into the Fields, Fats thought about what had happened at home the previous evening, when his mother had entered his bedroom for the first time since Cubby had punched him.\\n\\n (\u0027That message about your father on the Parish Council website,\u0027 she had said. \u0027I\u0027ve got to ask you this, Stuart, and I wish - Stuart, did you write it?\u0027\\n\\n It had taken her a few days to summon the courage to accuse him, and he was prepared.\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n Perhaps it would have been more authentic to say yes, but he had preferred not to, and he did not see why he should have to justify himself.\\n\\n \u0027You didn\u0027t?\u0027 she repeated, with no change of tone or expression.\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 he repeated.\\n\\n \u0027Because very, very few people know what Dad ... what he worries about.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, it wasn\u0027t me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027The post went up the same evening that Dad and you had the row, and Dad hit - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve told you, I didn\u0027t do it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You know he\u0027s ill, Stuart.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yeah, so you keep telling me.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I keep telling you because it\u0027s true! He can\u0027t help it - he\u0027s got a serious mental illness that causes him untold distress and misery.\u0027\\n\\n Fats\u0027 mobile had beeped, and he had glanced down at a text from Andrew. He read it and experienced an air punch to the midriff: Arf leaving for good.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m talking to you, Stuart - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027I know - what?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027All these posts - Simon Price, Parminder, Dad - these are all people you know. If you\u0027re behind all this - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve told you, I\u0027m not.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027 - you\u0027re causing untold damage. Serious, awful damage, Stuart, to people\u0027s lives.\u0027\\n\\n Fats was trying to imagine life without Andrew. They had known each other since they were four.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s not me,\u0027 he had said.)\\n\\n Serious, awful damage to people\u0027s lives.\\n\\n They had made their lives, Fats thought scornfully as he turned into Foley Road. The victims of the Ghost of Barry Fairbrother were mired in hypocrisy and lies, and they didn\u0027t like the exposure. They were stupid bugs running from bright light. They knew nothing about real life.\\n\\n He could see a house ahead that had a bald tyre lying on the grass in front of it. He had a strong suspicion that that was Krystal\u0027s, and when he saw the number, he knew he was right. He had never been here before. He would never have agreed to meet her at her home during the lunch hour a couple of weeks ago, but things changed. He had changed.\\n\\n They said that her mother was a prostitute. She was certainly a junkie. Krystal had told him that the house would be empty because her mother would be at Bellchapel Addiction Clinic, receiving her allotted amount of methadone. Fats walked up the garden path without slowing, but with unexpected trepidation.\\n\\n Krystal had been on the watch for him, from her bedroom window. She had closed the doors of every room downstairs, so that all he would see was the hall; she had thrown everything that had spilt into it back into the sitting room and kitchen. The carpet was gritty and burnt in places, and the wallpaper stained, but she could do nothing about that. There had been none of the pine-scented disinfectant left, but she had found some bleach and sloshed that around the kitchen and bathroom, both of them sources of the worst smells in the house.\\n\\n When he knocked, she ran downstairs. They did not have long; Terri would probably be back with Robbie at one. Not long to make a baby.\\n\\n \u0027Hiya,\u0027 she said, when she opened the door.\\n\\n \u0027All right?\u0027 said Fats, blowing out smoke through his nostrils.\\n\\n He did not know what he had expected. His first glimpse of the interior of the house was of a grimy bare box. There was no furniture. The closed doors to his left and ahead were strangely ominous.\\n\\n \u0027Are we the only ones here?\u0027 he asked as he crossed the threshold.\\n\\n \u0027Yeah,\u0027 said Krystal. \u0027We c\u0027n go upstairs. My room.\u0027\\n\\n She led the way. The deeper inside they went, the worse the smell became: mingled bleach and filth. Fats tried not to care. All doors were closed on the landing, except one. Krystal went inside.\\n\\n Fats did not want to be shocked, but there was nothing in the room except a mattress, which was covered with a sheet and a bare duvet, and a small pile of clothes heaped up in a corner. A few pictures ripped from tabloid newspapers were sellotaped to the wall; a mixture of pop stars and celebrities.\\n\\n Krystal had made her collage the previous day, in imitation of the one on Nikki\u0027s bedroom wall. Knowing that Fats was coming over, she had wanted to make the room more hospitable. She had drawn the thin curtains. They gave a blueish tinge to daylight.\\n\\n \u0027Gimme a fag,\u0027 she said. \u0027I\u0027m gasping.\u0027\\n\\n He lit it for her. She was more nervous than he had ever seen her; he preferred her cocky and worldly.\\n\\n \u0027We ain\u0027 got long,\u0027 she told him, and with the cigarette in her mouth, she began to strip. \u0027Me mum\u0027ll be back.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yeah, at Bellchapel, isn\u0027t she?\u0027 said Fats, somehow trying to harden Krystal up again in his mind.\\n\\n \u0027Yeah,\u0027 said Krystal, sitting on the mattress and pulling off her tracksuit bottoms.\\n\\n \u0027What if they close it?\u0027 asked Fats, taking off his blazer. \u0027I heard they\u0027re thinking about it.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I dunno,\u0027 said Krystal, but she was frightened. Her mother\u0027s willpower, fragile and vulnerable as a fledgling chick, could fail at the slightest provocation.\\n\\n She had already stripped to her underwear. Fats was taking off his shoes when he noticed something nestled beside her heaped clothes: a small plastic jewellery box lying open, and curled inside, a familiar watch.\\n\\n \u0027Is that my mum\u0027s?\u0027 he said, in surprise.\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027 Krystal panicked. \u0027No,\u0027 she lied. \u0027It was my Nana Cath\u0027s. Don\u0027t - !\u0027\\n\\n But he had already pulled it out of the box.\\n\\n \u0027It is hers,\u0027 he said. He recognized the strap.\\n\\n \u0027It fuckin\u0027 ain\u0027t!\u0027\\n\\n She was terrified. She had almost forgotten that she had stolen it, where it had come from. Fats was silent, and she did not like it.\\n\\n The watch in Fats\u0027 hand seemed to be both challenging and reproaching him. In quick succession he imagined walking out, slipping it casually into his pocket, or handing it back to Krystal with a shrug.\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s mine,\u0027 she said.\\n\\n He did not want to be a policeman. He wanted to be lawless. But it took the recollection that the watch had been Cubby\u0027s gift to make him hand it back to her and carry on taking off his clothes. Scarlet in the face, Krystal tugged off bra and pants and slipped, naked, beneath the duvet.\\n\\n Fats approached her in his boxer shorts, a wrapped condom in his hand.\\n\\n \u0027We don\u0027 need that,\u0027 said Krystal thickly. \u0027I\u0027m takin\u0027 the pill now.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Are you?\u0027\\n\\n She moved over on the mattress for him. Fats slid under the duvet. As he pulled off his boxers, he wondered whether she was lying about the pill, like the watch. But he had wanted to try without a condom for a while.\\n\\n \u0027Go on,\u0027 she whispered, and she tugged the little foil square out of his hand and threw it on top of his blazer, crumpled on the floor.\\n\\n He imagined Krystal pregnant with his child; the faces of Tessa and Cubby when they heard. His kid in the Fields, his flesh and blood. It would be more than Cubby had ever managed.\\n\\n He climbed on top of her; this, he knew, was real life. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-casual-vacancy/page-35.html","bookId":2230,"book":{"id":2230,"title":"The Casual Vacancy","description":"Storyline: When Barry Fairbrother dies unexpectedly in his early forties, the little town of Pagford is left in shock.
