Want to wait and see it made public or shall I tell you now?\u0027\n Miles turned away instinctively from Samantha, who was sitting opposite him at the island in the middle of the kitchen. They were having a last coffee before she and Libby set off for the station and the concert in London. With the handset pressed tightly to his ear, he said, \u0027Go on.\u0027\n \u0027You won. Comfortably. Pretty much two to one over Wall.\u0027\n Miles grinned at the kitchen door.\n \u0027OK,\u0027 he said, keeping his voice as steady as he could. \u0027Good to know.\u0027\n \u0027Hang on,\u0027 said Howard. \u0027Mum wants a word.\u0027\n \u0027Well done, darling,\u0027 said Shirley gleefully. \u0027Absolutely wonderful news. I knew you\u0027d do it.\u0027\n \u0027Thanks, Mum,\u0027 said Miles.\n Those two words told Samantha everything, but she had resolved not to be scornful or sarcastic. Her band T-shirt was packed; she had had her hair done and she had bought new heels. She could hardly wait to leave.\n \u0027Parish Councillor Mollison then, is it?\u0027 she said, when he had hung up.\n \u0027That\u0027s right,\u0027 he said a little warily.\n \u0027Congratulations,\u0027 she said. \u0027It\u0027s going to be a real celebration tonight, then. I\u0027m sorry I\u0027m missing it, actually,\u0027 she lied, out of excitement at her imminent escape. Touched, Miles leaned forward and squeezed her hand.\n Libby appeared in the kitchen in tears. She was clutching her mobile in her hand.\n \u0027What?\u0027 said Samantha, startled.\n \u0027Please will you call Harriet\u0027s mum?\u0027\n \u0027Why?\u0027\n \u0027Please will you?\u0027\n \u0027But why, Libby?\u0027\n \u0027Because she wants to talk to you, because,\u0027 Libby wiped her eyes and nose on the back of her hand, \u0027Harriet and I\u0027ve had a big row. Please will you call her?\u0027\n Samantha took the telephone through to the sitting room. She had only the haziest idea who this woman was. Since the girls had started at boarding school she had virtually no contact with their friends\u0027 parents.\n \u0027I\u0027m so desperately sorry to do this,\u0027 said Harriet\u0027s mother. \u0027I told Harriet I\u0027d speak to you, because I\u0027ve been telling her it\u0027s not that Libby doesn\u0027t want her to go ... you know how close they are, and I hate seeing them like this ...\u0027\n Samantha checked her watch. They needed to leave in ten minutes at the latest.\n \u0027Harriet\u0027s got it into her head that Libby had a spare ticket, but didn\u0027t want to take her. I\u0027ve told her it\u0027s not true - you\u0027re taking the ticket because you don\u0027t want Libby going alone, aren\u0027t you?\u0027\n \u0027Well, naturally,\u0027 said Samantha, \u0027she can\u0027t go alone.\u0027\n \u0027I knew it,\u0027 said the other woman. She sounded strangely triumphant. \u0027And I absolutely understand your protectiveness, and I would never suggest it if I didn\u0027t think it would save you an awful lot of bother. It\u0027s just that the girls are so close - and Harriet\u0027s absolutely wild about this silly group - and I think, from what Libby\u0027s just told Harriet on the phone, that Libby\u0027s really desperate for her to go too. I totally understand why you want to keep an eye on Libby, but the thing is, my sister\u0027s taking her two girls, so there would be an adult there with them. I could drive Libby and Harriet up together this afternoon, we\u0027d meet up with the others outside the stadium and we could all stay overnight at my sister\u0027s place. I absolutely guarantee that my sister or I will be with Libby at all times.\u0027\n \u0027Oh ... that\u0027s so kind. But my friend,\u0027 said Samantha, with a strange ringing in her ears, \u0027is expecting us, you see ...\u0027\n \u0027But if you still wanted to go and visit your friend ... all I\u0027m saying is there\u0027s really no need for you to attend, is there, if somebody else is with the girls? ... And Harriet\u0027s absolutely desperate - really desperate - I wasn\u0027t going to get involved, but now it\u0027s putting a strain on their friendship ...\u0027\n Then, on a less gushing note, \u0027We\u0027d buy the ticket from you, of course.\u0027\n There was nowhere to go, nowhere to hide.\n \u0027Oh,\u0027 said Samantha. \u0027Yes. I just thought it might be nice to go with her - \u0027\n \u0027They\u0027d much prefer to be with each other,\u0027 said Harriet\u0027s mother firmly. \u0027And you won\u0027t have to crouch down and hide among all the little teenyboppers, ha ha - it\u0027s all right for my sister, she\u0027s only five foot two.\u0027 \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-casual-vacancy/page-40.html","bookId":2230,"book":{"id":2230,"title":"The Casual Vacancy","description":"Storyline: \n When Barry Fairbrother dies unexpectedly in his early forties, the little town of Pagford is left in shock. Pagford is, seemingly, an English idyll, with a cobbled market square and an ancient abbey, but what lies behind the pretty fade is a town at war. Rich at war with poor, teenagers at war with their parents, wives at war with their husbands, teachers at war with their pupils. Pagford is not what it first seems. And the empty seat left by Barry on the town\u0027s council soon becomes the catalyst for the biggest war the town has yet seen. Who will triumph in an election fraught with passion, duplicity and unexpected revelations? Blackly comic, thought-provoking and constantly surprising, The Casual Vacancy is J.K.
