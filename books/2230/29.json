Charles Arnold-Baker Local Council Administration, Seventh Edition I Samantha Mollison had now bought herself all three of the DVDs released by Libby\u0027s favourite boy band. She kept them hidden in her socks and tights drawer, beside her diaphragm. She had her story ready, if Miles spotted them: they were a gift for Libby. Sometimes at work, where business was slower than ever, she searched the internet for pictures of Jake. It was during one of these trawling sessions - Jake in a suit but with no shirt, Jake in jeans and a white vest - that she discovered that the band was playing at Wembley in a fortnight\u0027s time. She had a friend from university who lived in West Ealing. She could stay over, sell it to Libby as a treat, a chance to spend time together. With more genuine excitement than she had felt in a long time, Samantha managed to buy two very expensive tickets for the concert. When she let herself into the house that evening, she glowed with a delicious secret, almost as though she were coming home from a date. Miles was already in the kitchen, still in his work suit, with the phone in his hand. He stared at her as she entered, and his expression was strange, difficult to read. \u0027What?\u0027 said Samantha, a little defensively. \u0027I can\u0027t get hold of Dad,\u0027 said Miles. \u0027His bloody phone\u0027s engaged. There\u0027s been another post.\u0027 And when Samantha looked nonplussed, he said with a trace of impatience, \u0027Barry Fairbrother\u0027s Ghost! Another message! On the council website!\u0027 \u0027Oh,\u0027 said Samantha, unwinding her scarf. \u0027Right.\u0027 \u0027Yeah, I met Betty Rossiter just now, coming up the street; she was full of it. I\u0027ve checked the message board, but I can\u0027t see it. Mum must\u0027ve taken it down already - well, I bloody hope she has, she\u0027ll be in the firing line if Bends-Your-Ear goes to a lawyer.\u0027 \u0027About Parminder Jawanda, was it?\u0027 asked Samantha, her tone deliberately casual. She did not ask what the accusation had been, first, because she was determined not to be a nosy, gossiping old bag like Shirley and Maureen, and secondly, because she thought she already knew: that Parminder had caused the death of old Cath Weedon. After a moment or two, she asked, sounding vaguely amused, \u0027Did you say your mother might be in the firing line?\u0027 \u0027Well, she\u0027s the site administrator, so she\u0027s liable if she doesn\u0027t get rid of defamatory or potentially defamatory statements. I\u0027m not sure she and Dad understand how serious this could be.\u0027 \u0027You could defend your mother, she\u0027d like that.\u0027 But Miles had not heard; he was pressing redial and scowling, because his father\u0027s mobile was still engaged. \u0027This is getting serious,\u0027 he said. \u0027You were all quite happy when it was Simon Price who was getting attacked. Why\u0027s this any different?\u0027 \u0027If it\u0027s a campaign against anyone on the council, or standing for council ...\u0027 Samantha turned away to hide her grin. His concern was not about Shirley after all. \u0027But why would anyone write stuff about you?\u0027 she asked innocently. \u0027You haven\u0027t got any guilty secrets.\u0027 You might be more bloody interesting if you had. \u0027What about that letter?\u0027 \u0027What letter?\u0027 \u0027For God\u0027s - Mum and Dad said there was a letter, an anonymous letter about me! Saying I wasn\u0027t fit to fill Barry Fairbrother\u0027s shoes!\u0027 Samantha opened the freezer and stared at the unappetizing contents, aware that Miles could no longer see her expression with the door open. \u0027You don\u0027t think anyone\u0027s got anything on you, do you?\u0027 she asked. \u0027No - but I\u0027m a lawyer, aren\u0027t I? There might be people with a grudge. I don\u0027t think this kind of anonymous stuff ... I mean, so far it\u0027s all about the other side, but there could be reprisals ... I don\u0027t like the way this thing\u0027s going.\u0027 \u0027Well, that\u0027s politics, Miles,\u0027 said Samantha, openly amused. \u0027Dirty business.\u0027 Miles stalked out of the room, but she did not care; her thoughts had already returned to chiselled cheekbones, winged eyebrows and taut, tight abdominal muscles. She could sing along with most of the songs now. She would buy a band T-shirt to wear - and one for Libby too. Jake would be undulating mere yards away from her. It would be more fun than she had had in years. Howard, meanwhile, was pacing up and down the closed delicatessen with his mobile phone clamped to his ear. The blinds were down, the lights were on, and through the archway in the wall Shirley and Maureen were busy in the soon-to-be-opened cafe, unpacking china and glasses, talking in excited undertones and half listening to Howard\u0027s almost monosyllabic contributions to his conversation. \u0027Yes ... mm, hmm ... yes ...\u0027 \u0027Screaming at me,\u0027 said Shirley. \u0027Screaming and swearing. \"Take it bloody down,\" she said. I said, \"I\u0027m taking it down, Dr Jawanda, and I\u0027ll thank you not to swear at me.\"\u0027 \u0027I\u0027d\u0027ve left it up there for another couple of hours if she\u0027d sworn at me,\u0027 said Maureen. Shirley smiled. As it happened, she had chosen to go and make herself a cup of tea, leaving the anonymous post about Parminder up on the site for an extra forty-five minutes before removing it. She and Maureen had already picked over the topic of the post until it was ragged and bare; there was plenty of scope for further dissection, but the immediate urge was sated. Instead, Shirley looked ahead, greedily, to Parminder\u0027s reaction to having her secret spilt in public. \u0027It can\u0027t have been her who did that post about Simon Price, after all,\u0027 said Maureen. \u0027No, obviously not,\u0027 said Shirley, as she wiped over the pretty blue and white china that she had chosen, overruling Maureen\u0027s preference for pink. Sometimes, though not directly involved in the business, Shirley liked to remind Maureen that she still had huge influence, as Howard\u0027s wife. \u0027Yes,\u0027 said Howard, on the telephone. \u0027But wouldn\u0027t it be better to ...? Mm, hmm ...\u0027 \u0027So who do you think it is?\u0027 asked Maureen. \u0027I really don\u0027t know,\u0027 said Shirley, in a genteel voice, as though such knowledge or suspicions were beneath her. \u0027Someone who knows the Prices and the Jawandas,\u0027 said Maureen. \u0027Obviously,\u0027 said Shirley again. Howard hung up at last. \u0027Aubrey agrees,\u0027 he told the two women, waddling through into the cafe. He was clutching today\u0027s edition of the Yarvil and District Gazette. \u0027Very weak piece. Very weak indeed.\u0027 It took the two women several seconds to recollect that they were supposed to be interested in the posthumous article by Barry Fairbrother in the local newspaper. His ghost was so much more interesting. \u0027Oh, yes; well, I thought it was very poor when I read it,\u0027 said Shirley, hurriedly catching up. \u0027The interview with Krystal Weedon was funny,\u0027 guffawed Maureen. \u0027Making out she enjoyed art. I suppose that\u0027s what she calls graffiti-ing the desks.\u0027 Howard laughed. As an excuse to turn her back, Shirley picked up Andrew Price\u0027s spare EpiPen from the counter, which Ruth had dropped into the delicatessen that morning. Shirley had looked up EpiPens on her favourite medical website, and felt fully competent to explain how adrenalin worked. Nobody asked, though, so she put the small white tube away in the cupboard and closed the door as noisily as she could to try and disrupt Maureen\u0027s further witticisms. The phone in Howard\u0027s huge hand rang. \u0027Yes, hello? Oh, Miles, yes ... yes, we know all about it ... Mum saw it this morning ...\u0027 He laughed. \u0027Yes, she\u0027s taken it down ... I don\u0027t know ... I think it was posted yesterday ... Oh, I wouldn\u0027t say that ... we\u0027ve all known about Bends-Your-Ear for years ...\u0027 But Howard\u0027s jocularity faded as Miles talked. After a while he said, \u0027Ah ... yes, I see. Yes. No, I hadn\u0027t considered it from ... perhaps we should get someone to have a look at security ...\u0027 The sound of a car in the darkening square outside went virtually unremarked by the three in the delicatessen, but its driver noticed the enormous shadow of Howard Mollison moving behind the cream blinds. Gavin put his foot down, eager to get to Mary. She had sounded desperate on the telephone. \u0027Who\u0027s doing this? Who\u0027s doing it? Who hates me this much?\u0027 \u0027Nobody hates you,\u0027 he had said. \u0027Who could hate you? Stay there ... I\u0027m coming over.\u0027 He parked outside the house, slammed the door and hurried up the footpath. She opened the front door before he had even knocked. Her eyes were puffy with tears again, and she was wearing a floor-length woollen dressing gown that dwarfed her. It was not at all seductive; the very antithesis of Kay\u0027s scarlet kimono, but its homeliness, its very shabbiness, represented a new level of intimacy. Mary\u0027s four children were all in the sitting room. Mary gestured him through into the kitchen. \u0027Do they know?\u0027 he asked her. \u0027Fergus does. Somebody at school told him. I\u0027ve asked him not to tell the others. Honestly, Gavin ... I\u0027m about at the end of my tether. The spite - \u0027 \u0027It isn\u0027t true,\u0027 he said, and then, his curiosity getting the better of him, \u0027is it?\u0027 \u0027No!\u0027 she said, outraged. \u0027I mean ... I don\u0027t know ... I don\u0027t really know her. But to make him talk like that ... putting the words in his mouth ... don\u0027t they care what it\u0027s like for me?\u0027 She dissolved into tears again. He felt that he shouldn\u0027t hug her while she was wearing her dressing gown, and was glad that he had not, when eighteen-year-old Fergus entered the kitchen a moment later. \u0027Hey, Gav.\u0027 The boy looked tired, older than his years. Gavin watched him put an arm around Mary and saw her lean her head against his shoulder, mopping her eyes on her baggy sleeve like a child. \u0027I don\u0027t think it was the same person,\u0027 Fergus told them, without preamble. \u0027I\u0027ve been looking at it again. The style of the message is different.\u0027 He had it on his mobile phone, and began to read aloud: \u0027\"Parish Councillor Dr Parminder Jawanda, who pretends to be so keen on looking after the poor and needy of the area, has always had a secret motive. Until I died - \"\u0027 \u0027Fergus, don\u0027t,\u0027 said Mary, slumping down at the kitchen table. \u0027I can\u0027t take it. I honestly can\u0027t. And his article in the paper today too.\u0027 As she covered her face with her hands and sobbed silently, Gavin noticed the Yarvil and District Gazette lying there. He never read it. Without asking or offering, he moved across to the cupboard to make her a drink. \u0027Thanks, Gav,\u0027 she said thickly, when he pushed the glass into her hand. \u0027It might be Howard Mollison,\u0027 suggested Gavin, sitting down beside her. \u0027From what Barry said about him.\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t think so,\u0027 said Mary, dabbing at her eyes. \u0027It\u0027s so crude. He never did anything like that when Barry was -\u0027 she hiccuped \u0027- alive.\u0027 And then she snapped at her son, \u0027Throw that paper away, Fergus.\u0027 The boy looked confused and hurt. \u0027It\u0027s got Dad\u0027s - \u0027 \u0027Throw it away!\u0027 said Mary, with an edge of hysteria in her voice. \u0027I can read it off the computer if I want to, the last thing he ever did - on our anniversary!\u0027 Fergus took the newspaper off the table and stood for a moment watching his mother, who had buried her face in her hands again. Then, with a glance at Gavin, he walked out of the room still holding the Gazette. After a while, when Gavin judged that Fergus was not coming back, he put out a consoling hand and rubbed Mary\u0027s arm. They sat in silence for some time, and Gavin felt much happier with the newspaper gone from the table.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-casual-vacancy/page-29.html","bookId":2230,"book":{"id":2230,"title":"The Casual Vacancy","description":"Storyline: When Barry Fairbrother dies unexpectedly in his early forties, the little town of Pagford is left in shock.
