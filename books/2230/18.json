{"id":107519,"no":18,"title":"Page 18","content":"Duplicity\n 7.25 A resolution should not deal with more than one subject ... Disregard of this rule usually leads to confused discussion and may lead to confused action ...\n Charles Arnold-Baker\n Local Council Administration,\n Seventh Edition\n I\n \u0027... ran out of here, screaming blue murder, calling her a Paki bitch - and now the paper\u0027s called for a comment, because she\u0027s ...\u0027\n Parminder heard the receptionist\u0027s voice, barely louder than a whisper, as she passed the door of the staff meeting room, which was ajar. One swift light step, and Parminder had pulled it open to reveal one of the receptionists and the practice nurse in close proximity. Both jumped and spun round.\n \u0027Doct\u0027 Jawan - \u0027\n \u0027You understand the confidentiality agreement you signed when you took this job, don\u0027t you, Karen?\u0027\n The receptionist looked aghast.\n \u0027Yeah, I - I wasn\u0027t - Laura already - I was coming to give you this note. The Yarvil and District Gazette\u0027s rang. Mrs Weedon\u0027s died and one of her granddaughters is saying - \u0027\n \u0027And are those for me?\u0027 asked Parminder coldly, pointing at the patient records in Karen\u0027s hand.\n \u0027Oh - yeah,\u0027 said Karen, flustered. \u0027He wanted to see Dr Crawford, but - \u0027\n \u0027You\u0027d better get back to the front desk.\u0027\n Parminder took the patient records and strode back out to reception, fuming. Once there, and facing the patients, she realized that she did not know whom to call, and glanced down at the folder in her hand.\n \u0027Mr - Mr Mollison.\u0027\n Howard heaved himself up, smiling, and walked towards her with his familiar rocking gait. Dislike rose like bile in Parminder\u0027s throat. She turned and walked back to her surgery, Howard following her.\n \u0027All well with Parminder?\u0027 he asked, as he closed her door and settled himself, without invitation, on the patient\u0027s chair.\n It was his habitual greeting, but today it felt like a taunt.\n \u0027What\u0027s the problem?\u0027 she asked brusquely.\n \u0027Bit of an irritation,\u0027 he said. \u0027Just here. Need a cream, or something.\u0027\n He tugged his shirt out of his trousers and lifted it a few inches. Parminder saw an angry red patch of skin at the edge of the fold where his stomach spilt out over his upper legs.\n \u0027You\u0027ll need to take your shirt off,\u0027 she said.\n \u0027It\u0027s only here that\u0027s itching.\u0027\n \u0027I need to see the whole area.\u0027\n He sighed and got to his feet. As he unbuttoned his shirt he said, \u0027Did you get the agenda I sent through this morning?\u0027\n \u0027No, I haven\u0027t checked emails today.\u0027\n This was a lie. Parminder had read his agenda and was furious about it, but this was not the moment to tell him so. She resented his trying to bring council business into her surgery, his way of reminding her that there was a place where she was his subordinate, even if here, in this room, she could order him to strip.\n \u0027Could you, please - I need to look under ...\u0027\n He hoisted the great apron of flesh upwards; the upper legs of his trousers were revealed, and finally the waistband. With his arms full of his own fat he smiled down at her. She drew her chair nearer, her head level with his belt.\n An ugly scaly rash had spread in the hidden crease of Howard\u0027s belly: a bright scalded red, it stretched from one side to the other of his torso like a huge, smeared smile. A whiff of rotting meat reached her nostrils.\n \u0027Intertrigo,\u0027 she said, \u0027and lichen simplex there, where you\u0027ve scratched. All right, you can put your shirt back on.\u0027\n He dropped his belly and reached for his shirt, unfazed.\n \u0027You\u0027ll see I\u0027ve put the Bellchapel building on the agenda. It\u0027s generating a bit of press interest at the moment.\u0027\n She was tapping something into the computer, and did not reply.\n \u0027Yarvil and District Gazette,\u0027 Howard said. \u0027I\u0027m doing them an article. Both sides,\u0027 he said, buttoning up his shirt, \u0027of the question.\u0027\n She was trying not to listen to him, but the sound of the newspaper\u0027s name caused the knot in her stomach to tighten.\n \u0027When did you last have your blood pressure done, Howard? I\u0027m not seeing a test in the last six months.\u0027\n \u0027It\u0027ll be fine. I\u0027m on medication for it.\u0027\n \u0027We should check, though. As you\u0027re here.\u0027\n He sighed again, and laboriously rolled up his sleeve.\n \u0027They\u0027ll be printing Barry\u0027s article before mine,\u0027 he said. \u0027You know he sent them an article? About the Fields?\u0027\n \u0027Yes,\u0027 she said, against her own better judgement.\n \u0027Haven\u0027t got a copy, have you? So I don\u0027t duplicate anything he\u0027s said?\u0027\n Her fingers trembled a little on the cuff. It would not meet around Howard\u0027s arm. She unfastened it and got up to fetch a bigger one.\n \u0027No,\u0027 she said, her back to him. \u0027I never saw it.\u0027\n He watched her work the pump, and observed the pressure dial with the indulgent smile of a man observing some pagan ritual.\n \u0027Too high,\u0027 she told him, as the needle registered one hundred and seventy over a hundred.\n \u0027I\u0027m on pills for it,\u0027 he said, scratching where the cuff had been, and letting down his sleeve. \u0027Dr Crawford seems happy.\u0027\n She scanned the list of his medications onscreen.\n \u0027You\u0027re on amlodipine and bendroflumethiazide for your blood pressure, yes? And simvastatin for your heart ... no beta-blocker ...\u0027\n \u0027Because of my asthma,\u0027 said Howard, tweaking his sleeve straight.\n \u0027... right ... and aspirin.\u0027 She turned to face him. \u0027Howard, your weight is the single biggest factor in all of your health problems. Have you ever been referred to the nutritionist?\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ve run a deli for thirty-five years,\u0027 he said, still smiling. \u0027I don\u0027t need teaching about food.\u0027\n \u0027A few lifestyle changes could make a big difference. If you were able to lose ...\u0027\n With the ghost of a wink, he said comfortably, \u0027Keep it simple. All I need is cream for the itch.\u0027\n Venting her temper on the keyboard, Parminder banged out prescriptions for anti-fungal and steroid creams, and when they were printed, handed them to Howard without another word.\n \u0027Thank you kindly,\u0027 he said, as he heaved himself out of the chair, \u0027and a very good day to you.\u0027 \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-casual-vacancy/page-18.html","bookId":2230,"book":{"id":2230,"title":"The Casual Vacancy","description":"Storyline: \n When Barry Fairbrother dies unexpectedly in his early forties, the little town of Pagford is left in shock.

And the empty seat left by Barry on the town\u0027s council soon becomes the catalyst for the biggest war the town has yet seen.
