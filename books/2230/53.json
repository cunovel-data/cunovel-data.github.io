He banged on the thick oak door with his left hand, while trying to dial his wife\u0027s number with his right. \u0027Yes?\u0027 said Parminder, opening the door. \u0027My dad,\u0027 gasped Miles \u0027... another heart attack ... Mum\u0027s called an ambulance ... will you come? Please, will you come?\u0027 Parminder made a swift move back into the house, mentally seizing her doctor\u0027s bag, but checked. \u0027I can\u0027t. I\u0027m suspended from work, Miles. I can\u0027t.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027re joking ... please ... the ambulance won\u0027t be here for - \u0027 \u0027I can\u0027t, Miles,\u0027 she said. He turned and ran away from her through the open gate. Ahead, he saw Samantha, walking up their garden path. He called to her, his voice breaking, and she turned in surprise. At first, she thought that his panic was on her account. \u0027Dad ... collapsed ... there\u0027s an ambulance coming ... bloody Parminder Jawanda won\u0027t come ...\u0027 \u0027My God,\u0027 said Samantha. \u0027Oh my God.\u0027 They dashed to the car and drove up the road, Miles in his slippers, Samantha in the clogs that had blistered her feet. \u0027Miles, listen, there\u0027s a siren - it\u0027s here already ...\u0027 But when they turned into Evertree Crescent, there was nothing there, and the siren was already gone. On a lawn a mile away, Sukhvinder Jawanda was vomiting river water beneath a willow tree, while an old lady pressed blankets around her that were already as sodden as Sukhvinder\u0027s clothes. A short distance away, the dog-walker who had dragged Sukhvinder from the river by her hair and her sweatshirt was bent over a small, limp body. Sukhvinder had thought she felt Robbie struggling in her arms, but had that been the cruel tug of the river, trying to rip him from her? She was a strong swimmer, but the Orr had dragged her under, pulled her helplessly wherever it chose. She had been swept around the bend, and it had thrown her in towards land, and she had managed a scream, and seen the man with his dog, running towards her along the bank ... \u0027No good,\u0027 said the man, who had worked on Robbie\u0027s little body for twenty minutes. \u0027He\u0027s gone.\u0027 Sukhvinder wailed, and slumped to the cold wet ground, shaking furiously as the sound of the siren reached them, too late. Back in Evertree Crescent, the paramedics were having enormous difficulty getting Howard onto the stretcher; Miles and Samantha had to help. \u0027We\u0027ll follow in the car, you go with Dad,\u0027 Miles shouted at Shirley, who seemed bewildered, and unwilling to get into the ambulance. Maureen, who had just shown her last customer out of the Copper Kettle, stood on the doorstep, listening. \u0027Lots of sirens,\u0027 she said over her shoulder to an exhausted Andrew, who was mopping tables. \u0027Something must have happened.\u0027 And she took a deep breath, as though she hoped to taste the tang of disaster on the warm afternoon air.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-casual-vacancy/page-53.html","bookId":2230,"book":{"id":2230,"title":"The Casual Vacancy","description":"Storyline: When Barry Fairbrother dies unexpectedly in his early forties, the little town of Pagford is left in shock.
