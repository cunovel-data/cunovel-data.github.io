Years of genteel avoidance of grisly topics (Shirley had been literally struck dumb when twenty-three-year-old Patricia had said: \u0027I\u0027m gay, Mum.\u0027) seemed to have muzzled something inside her.\n The doorbell rang. Lexie said, \u0027Dad told me to come round here. He and Mum have got something to do. Where\u0027s Grandad?\u0027\n \u0027In bed,\u0027 said Shirley. \u0027He overdid it a bit last night.\u0027\n \u0027It was a good party, wasn\u0027t it?\u0027 said Lexie.\n \u0027Yes, lovely,\u0027 said Shirley, with a tempest building inside her.\n After a while, her granddaughter\u0027s prattling wore Shirley down.\n \u0027Let\u0027s have lunch at the cafe,\u0027 she suggested. \u0027Howard,\u0027 she called through the closed bedroom door, \u0027I\u0027m taking Lexie for lunch at the Copper Kettle.\u0027\n He sounded worried, and she was glad. She was not afraid of Maureen. She would look Maureen right in the face ...\n But it occurred to Shirley, as she walked, that Howard might have telephoned Maureen the moment she had left the bungalow. She was so stupid ... somehow, she had thought that, in calling Maureen herself about Howard\u0027s illness, she had stopped them communicating ... she was forgetting ...\n The familiar, well-loved streets seemed different, strange. She had taken a regular inventory of the window she presented to this lovely little world: wife and mother, hospital volunteer, secretary to the Parish Council, First Citizeness; and Pagford had been her mirror, reflecting, in its polite respect, her value and her worth. But the Ghost had taken a rubber stamp and smeared across the pristine surface of her life a revelation that would nullify it all: \u0027her husband was sleeping with his business partner, and she never knew ...\u0027\n It would be all that anyone said, when she was mentioned; all that they ever remembered about her.\n She pushed open the door of the cafe; the bell tinkled, and Lexie said, \u0027There\u0027s Peanut Price.\u0027\n \u0027Howard all right?\u0027 croaked Maureen.\n \u0027Just tired,\u0027 said Shirley, moving smoothly to a table and sitting down, her heart beating so fast that she wondered whether she might have a coronary herself.\n \u0027Tell him neither of the girls has turned up,\u0027 said Maureen crossly, lingering by their table, \u0027and neither of them bothered to call in either. It\u0027s lucky we\u0027re not busy.\u0027\n Lexie went to the counter to talk to Andrew, who had been put on waiter duty. Conscious of her unusual solitude, as she sat alone at the table, Shirley remembered Mary Fairbrother, erect and gaunt at Barry\u0027s funeral, widowhood draped around her like a queen\u0027s train; the pity, the admiration. In losing her husband, Mary had become the silent passive recipient of admiration, whereas she, shackled to a man who had betrayed her, was cloaked in grubbiness, a target of derision ...\n (Long ago, in Yarvil, men had subjected Shirley to smutty jokes because of her mother\u0027s reputation, even though she, Shirley, had been as pure as it was possible to be.)\n \u0027Grandad\u0027s feeling ill,\u0027 Lexie was telling Andrew. \u0027What\u0027s in those cakes?\u0027\n He bent down behind the counter, hiding his red face.\n I snogged your mum.\n Andrew had almost skived off work. He had been afraid that Howard might sack him on the spot for kissing his daughter-in-law, and was downright terrified that Miles Mollison might storm in, looking for him. At the same time, he was not so naive that he did not know that Samantha, who must, he thought ruthlessly, be well over forty, would figure as the villain of the piece. His defence was simple. \u0027She was pissed and she grabbed me.\u0027\n There was a tiny glimmer of pride in his embarrassment. He had been anxious to see Gaia; he wanted to tell her that a grown woman had pounced on him. He had hoped that they might laugh about it, the way that they laughed about Maureen, but that she might be secretly impressed; and also that in the course of laughing, he might find out exactly what she had done with Fats; how far she had let him go. He was prepared to forgive her. She had been pissed too. But she had not turned up.\n He went to fetch a napkin for Lexie and almost collided with his boss\u0027s wife, who was standing behind the counter, holding his EpiPen.\n \u0027Howard wanted me to check something,\u0027 Shirley told him. \u0027And this needle shouldn\u0027t be kept in here. I\u0027ll put it in the back.\u0027\n \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-casual-vacancy/page-49.html","bookId":2230,"book":{"id":2230,"title":"The Casual Vacancy","description":"Storyline: \n When Barry Fairbrother dies unexpectedly in his early forties, the little town of Pagford is left in shock. Pagford is, seemingly, an English idyll, with a cobbled market square and an ancient abbey, but what lies behind the pretty fade is a town at war. Rich at war with poor, teenagers at war with their parents, wives at war with their husbands, teachers at war with their pupils. Pagford is not what it first seems. And the empty seat left by Barry on the town\u0027s council soon becomes the catalyst for the biggest war the town has yet seen. Who will triumph in an election fraught with passion, duplicity and unexpected revelations? Blackly comic, thought-provoking and constantly surprising, The Casual Vacancy is J.K.
