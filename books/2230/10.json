Gavin had telephoned Kay from his car on the way back from Barry\u0027s burial and told her that he wished she had been there, that the whole day had been horrible and that he hoped he could see her that night. He considered these humble admissions no more or less than the price he had to pay for an evening of undemanding companionship.\\n\\n But Kay seemed to consider them more in the light of a down payment on a renegotiated contract. You missed me. You needed me when you were upset. You\u0027re sorry we didn\u0027t go as a couple. Well, let\u0027s not make that mistake again. There had been a certain complacency about the way she had treated him since; a briskness, a sense of renewed expectation.\\n\\n He was making spaghetti Bolognese tonight; he had deliberately omitted to buy a pudding or to lay the table in advance; he was at pains to show her that he had not made much of an effort. Kay seemed oblivious, even determined to take this casual attitude as a compliment. She sat at his small kitchen table, talking to him over the pitter-patter of rain on the skylight, her eyes wandering over the fixtures and fittings. She had not often been here.\\n\\n \u0027I suppose Lisa chose this yellow, did she?\u0027\\n\\n She was doing it again: breaking taboos, as though they had recently passed to a deeper level of intimacy. Gavin preferred not to talk about Lisa if he could avoid it; surely she knew that by now? He shook oregano onto the mince in his frying pan and said, \u0027No, this was all the previous owner. I haven\u0027t got round to changing it yet.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh,\u0027 she said, sipping wine. \u0027Well, it\u0027s quite nice. A bit bland.\u0027\\n\\n This rankled with Gavin, as, in his opinion, the interior of the Smithy was superior in every way to that of Ten Hope Street. He watched the pasta bubbling, keeping his back to her.\\n\\n \u0027Guess what?\u0027 she said. \u0027I met Samantha Mollison this afternoon.\u0027\\n\\n Gavin wheeled around; how did Kay even know what Samantha Mollison looked like?\\n\\n \u0027Just outside the deli in the Square; I was on my way in to get this,\u0027 said Kay, clinking the wine bottle beside her with a flick of her nail. \u0027She asked me whether I was Gavin\u0027s girlfriend.\u0027\\n\\n Kay said it archly, but actually she had been heartened by Samantha\u0027s choice of words, relieved to think that this was how Gavin described her to his friends.\\n\\n \u0027And what did you say?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I said - I said yes.\u0027\\n\\n Her expression was crestfallen. Gavin had not meant to ask the question quite so aggressively. He would have given a lot to prevent Kay and Samantha ever meeting.\\n\\n \u0027Anyway,\u0027 Kay proceeded with a slight edge to her voice, \u0027she\u0027s asked us for dinner next Friday. Week today.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, bloody hell,\u0027 said Gavin crossly.\\n\\n A lot of Kay\u0027s cheerfulness deserted her.\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s the problem?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Nothing. It\u0027s - nothing,\u0027 he said, prodding the bubbling spaghetti. \u0027It\u0027s just that I see enough of Miles during work hours, to be honest.\u0027\\n\\n It was what he had dreaded all along: that she would worm her way in and they would become Gavin-and-Kay, with a shared social circle, so that it would become progressively more difficult to excise her from his life. How had he let this happen? Why had he allowed her to move down here? Fury at himself mutated easily into anger with her. Why couldn\u0027t she realize how little he wanted her, and take herself off without forcing him to do the dirty? He drained the spaghetti in the sink, swearing under his breath as he speckled himself with boiling water.\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027d better call Miles and Samantha and tell them \"no\", then,\u0027 said Kay.\\n\\n Her voice had hardened. As was Gavin\u0027s deeply ingrained habit, he sought to deflect an imminent conflict and hoped that the future would look after itself.\\n\\n \u0027No, no,\u0027 he said, dabbing at his wet shirt with a tea towel. \u0027We\u0027ll go. It\u0027s fine. We\u0027ll go.\u0027\\n\\n But in his undisguised lack of enthusiasm, he sought to put down a marker to which he could refer, retrospectively. You knew I didn\u0027t want to go. No, I didn\u0027t enjoy it. No, I don\u0027t want it to happen again.\\n\\n They ate for several minutes in silence. Gavin was afraid that there would be another row, and that Kay would force him to discuss underlying issues again. He cast around for something to say, and so started telling her about Mary Fairbrother and the life insurance company.\\n\\n \u0027They\u0027re being real bastards,\u0027 he said. \u0027He was heavily insured, but their lawyers are looking for a way not to pay out. They\u0027re trying to make out he didn\u0027t make a full disclosure.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027In what way?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, an uncle died of an aneurysm, too. Mary swears Barry told the insurance agent that when he signed the policy, but it\u0027s nowhere in the notes. Presumably the bloke didn\u0027t realize it can be a genetic thing. I don\u0027t know that Barry did, come to ...\u0027\\n\\n Gavin\u0027s voice broke. Horrified and embarrassed, he bowed his flushing face over his plate. There was a hard chunk of grief in his throat and he couldn\u0027t shift it. Kay\u0027s chair legs scraped on the floor; he hoped that she was off to the bathroom, but then felt her arms around his shoulders, drawing him to her. Without thinking, he put a single arm around her, too.\\n\\n It was so good to be held. If only their relationship could be distilled into simple, wordless gestures of comfort. Why had humans ever learned to talk?\\n\\n He had dribbled snot onto the back of her top.\\n\\n \u0027Sorry,\u0027 he said thickly, wiping it away with his napkin.\\n\\n He withdrew from her and blew his nose. She dragged her chair to sit beside him and put a hand on his arm. He liked her so much better when she was silent, and her face was soft and concerned, as it was now.\\n\\n \u0027I still can\u0027t ... he was a good bloke,\u0027 he said. \u0027Barry. He was a good bloke.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, everyone says that about him,\u0027 said Kay.\\n\\n She had never been allowed to meet this famous Barry Fairbrother, but she was intrigued by the show of emotion from Gavin, and by the person who had caused it.\\n\\n \u0027Was he funny?\u0027 she asked, because she could imagine Gavin in thrall to a comedian, to a rowdy ringleader, propping up the bar.\\n\\n \u0027Yeah, I s\u0027pose. Well, not particularly. Normal. He liked a laugh ... but he was just such a ... such a nice bloke. He liked people, you know?\u0027\\n\\n She waited, but Gavin did not seem able to elucidate further on the niceness of Barry.\\n\\n \u0027And the kids ... and Mary ... poor Mary ... God, you\u0027ve got no idea.\u0027\\n\\n Kay continued to pat his arm gently, but her sympathy had chilled a little. No idea, she thought, what it was to be alone? No idea how hard it was to be left in sole charge of a family? Where was his pity for her, Kay?\\n\\n \u0027They were really happy,\u0027 said Gavin, in a cracked voice. \u0027She\u0027s in pieces.\u0027\\n\\n Wordlessly, Kay stroked his arm, reflecting that she had never been able to afford to go to pieces.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m all right,\u0027 he said, wiping his nose on his napkin and picking up his fork. By the smallest of twitches, he indicated that she should remove her hand. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-casual-vacancy/page-10.html","bookId":2230,"book":{"id":2230,"title":"The Casual Vacancy","description":"Storyline: When Barry Fairbrother dies unexpectedly in his early forties, the little town of Pagford is left in shock.
