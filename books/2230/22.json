{"id":107523,"no":22,"title":"Page 22","content":"V\\n\\n Ruth stood alone in her lamp-lit sitting room, continuing to grip the telephone she had just replaced in its cradle.\\n\\n Hilltop House was small and compact. It was always easy to tell the location of each of the four Prices, because voices, footfalls and the sounds of doors opening and shutting carried so effectively in the old house. Ruth knew that her husband was still in the shower, because she could hear the hot water boiler under the stairs hissing and clanking. She had waited for Simon to turn on the water before telephoning Shirley, worried that he might think that even her request about the EpiPen was fraternizing with the enemy.\\n\\n The family PC was set up in a corner of the sitting room, where Simon could keep an eye on it, and make sure nobody was running up large bills behind his back. Ruth relinquished her grip on the phone and hurried to the keyboard.\\n\\n It seemed to take a very long time to bring up the Pagford Council website. Ruth pushed her reading glasses up her nose with a trembling hand as she scanned the various pages. At last she found the message board. Her husband\u0027s name blazed out at her, in ghastly black and white: Simon Price Unfit to Stand for Council.\\n\\n She double-clicked the title, brought up the full paragraph and read it. Everything around her seemed to reel and spin.\\n\\n \u0027Oh God,\u0027 she whispered.\\n\\n The boiler had stopped clanking. Simon would be putting on the pyjamas he had warmed on the radiator. He had already drawn the sitting-room curtains, turned on the side lamps and lit the wood-burner, so that he could come down and stretch out on the sofa to watch the news.\\n\\n Ruth knew that she would have to tell him. Not doing so, letting him find out for himself, was simply not an option; she would have been incapable of keeping it to herself. She felt terrified and guilty, though she did not know why.\\n\\n She heard him jogging down the stairs and then he appeared at the door in his blue brushed-cotton pyjamas.\\n\\n \u0027Si,\u0027 she whispered.\\n\\n \u0027What\u0027s the matter?\u0027 he said, immediately irritated. He knew that something had happened; that his luxurious programme of sofa, fire and news was about to be disarranged.\\n\\n She pointed at the computer monitor, one hand pressed foolishly over her mouth, like a little girl. Her terror infected him. He strode to the PC and scowled down at the screen. He was not a quick reader. He read every word, every line, painstakingly, carefully.\\n\\n When he had finished, he remained quite still, passing for review, in his mind, all the likely grasses. He thought of the gum-chewing forklift driver, whom he had left stranded in the Fields when they had picked up the new computer. He thought of Jim and Tommy, who did the cash-in-hand jobs on the sly with him. Someone from work must have talked. Rage and fear collided inside him and set off a combustive reaction.\\n\\n He strode to the foot of the stairs and shouted, \u0027You two! Get down here NOW!\u0027\\n\\n Ruth still had her hand over her mouth. He had a sadistic urge to slap her hand away, to tell her to fucking pull herself together, it was he who was in the shit.\\n\\n Andrew entered the room first with Paul behind him. Andrew saw the arms of Pagford Parish Council onscreen, and his mother with her hand over her mouth. Walking barefoot across the old carpet, he had the sensation that he was plummeting through the air in a broken lift.\\n\\n \u0027Someone,\u0027 said Simon, glaring at his sons, \u0027has talked about things I\u0027ve mentioned inside this house.\u0027\\n\\n Paul had brought his chemistry exercise book downstairs with him; he was holding it like a hymnal. Andrew kept his gaze fixed on his father, trying to project an expression of mingled confusion and curiosity.\\n\\n \u0027Who\u0027s told other people we\u0027ve got a stolen computer?\u0027 asked Simon.\\n\\n \u0027I haven\u0027t,\u0027 said Andrew.\\n\\n Paul stared at his father blankly, trying to process the question. Andrew willed his brother to speak. Why did he have to be so slow?\\n\\n \u0027Well?\u0027 Simon snarled at Paul.\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t think I - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027You don\u0027t think? You don\u0027t think you told anyone?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, I don\u0027t think I told any - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, this is interesting,\u0027 said Simon, pacing up and down in front of Paul. \u0027This is interesting.\u0027\\n\\n With a slap he sent Paul\u0027s exercise book flying out of his hands.\\n\\n \u0027Try and think, dipshit,\u0027 he growled. \u0027Try and fucking think. Did you tell anyone we\u0027ve got a stolen computer?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Not stolen,\u0027 said Paul. \u0027I never told anyone - I don\u0027t think I told anyone we had a new one, even.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I see,\u0027 said Simon. \u0027So the news got out by magic then, did it?\u0027\\n\\n He was pointing at the computer monitor.\\n\\n \u0027Someone\u0027s fucking talked!\u0027 he yelled, \u0027because it\u0027s on the fucking internet! And I\u0027ll be fucking lucky not - to - lose - my - job!\u0027\\n\\n On each of the five last words he thumped Paul on the head with his fist. Paul cowered and ducked; black liquid trickled from his left nostril; he suffered nosebleeds several times a week.\\n\\n \u0027And what about you?\u0027 Simon roared at his wife, who was still frozen beside the computer, her eyes wide behind her glasses, her hand clamped like a yashmak over her mouth. \u0027Have you been fucking gossiping?\u0027\\n\\n Ruth ungagged herself.\\n\\n \u0027No, Si,\u0027 she whispered, \u0027I mean, the only person I told we had a new computer was Shirley - and she\u0027d never - \u0027\\n\\n You stupid woman, you stupid fucking woman, what did you have to tell him that for?\\n\\n \u0027You did what?\u0027 asked Simon quietly.\\n\\n \u0027I told Shirley,\u0027 whimpered Ruth. \u0027I didn\u0027t say it was stolen, though, Si. I only said you were bringing it home - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, that\u0027s fucking it then, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 roared Simon; his voice became a scream. \u0027Her fucking son\u0027s standing for election, of course she wants to get the fucking goods on me!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But she\u0027s the one who told me, Si, just now, she wouldn\u0027t have - \u0027\\n\\n He ran at her and hit her in the face, exactly as he had wanted to when he had first seen her silly frightened expression; her glasses spun into the air and smashed against the bookcase; he hit her again and she crashed down onto the computer table she had bought so proudly with her first month\u0027s wages from South West General.\\n\\n Andrew had made himself a promise: he seemed to move in slow motion, and everything was cold and clammy and slightly unreal.\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t hit her,\u0027 he said, forcing himself between his parents. \u0027Don\u0027t - \u0027\\n\\n His lip split against his front tooth, Simon\u0027s knuckle behind it, and he fell backwards on top of his mother, who was draped over the keyboard; Simon threw another punch, which hit Andew\u0027s arms as he protected his face; Andrew was trying to get off his slumped, struggling mother, and Simon was in a frenzy, pummelling both of them wherever he could reach -\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t you fucking dare tell me what to do - don\u0027t you dare, you cowardly little shit, you spotty streak of piss - \u0027\\n\\n Andrew dropped to his knees to get out of the way, and Simon kicked him in the ribs. Andrew heard Paul say pathetically, \u0027Stop it!\u0027 Simon\u0027s foot swung for Andrew\u0027s ribcage again, but Andrew dodged it; Simon\u0027s toes collided with the brick fireplace and he was suddenly, absurdly, howling in pain.\\n\\n Andrew scrambled out of the way; Simon was gripping the end of his foot, hopping on the spot and swearing in a high-pitched voice; Ruth had collapsed into the swivel chair, sobbing into her hands. Andrew got to his feet; he could taste his own blood.\\n\\n \u0027Anyone could have talked about that computer,\u0027 he panted, braced for further violence; he felt braver now that it had begun, now that the fight was really on; it was waiting that told on your nerves, watching Simon\u0027s jaw begin to jut, and hearing the urge for violence building in his voice. \u0027You told us a security guard got beaten up. Anyone could have talked. It\u0027s not us - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t you - fucking little shit - I\u0027ve broken my fucking toe!\u0027 Simon gasped, falling backwards into an armchair, still nursing his foot. He seemed to expect sympathy.\\n\\n Andrew imagined picking up a gun and shooting Simon in the face, watching his features blast apart, his brains spattering the room.\\n\\n \u0027And Pauline\u0027s got her fucking period again!\u0027 Simon yelled at Paul, who was trying to contain the blood dripping through his fingers from his nose. \u0027Get off the carpet! Get off the fucking carpet, you little pansy!\u0027\\n\\n Paul scuttled out of the room. Andrew pressed the hem of his T-shirt to his stinging mouth.\\n\\n \u0027What about all the cash-in-hand jobs?\u0027 Ruth sobbed, her cheek pink from his punch, tears dripping from her chin. Andrew hated to see her humiliated and pathetic like this; but he half hated her too for landing herself in it, when any idiot could have seen ... \u0027It says about the cash-in-hand jobs. Shirley doesn\u0027t know about them, how could she? Someone at the printworks has put that on there. I told you, Si, I told you you shouldn\u0027t do those jobs, they\u0027ve always worried the living daylights out of - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027Fucking shut up, you whining cow, you didn\u0027t mind spending the money!\u0027 yelled Simon, his jaw jutting again; and Andrew wanted to roar at his mother to stay silent: she blabbed when any idiot could have told her she should keep quiet, and she kept quiet when she might have done good by speaking out; she never learned, she never saw any of it coming.\\n\\n Nobody spoke for a minute. Ruth dabbed at her eyes with the back of her hand and sniffed intermittently. Simon clutched his toe, his jaw clenched, breathing loudly. Andrew licked the blood from his stinging lip, which he could feel swelling.\\n\\n \u0027This\u0027ll cost me my fucking job,\u0027 said Simon, staring wild-eyed around the room, as if there might be somebody there he had forgotten to hit. \u0027They\u0027re already talking about fucking redundancies. This\u0027ll be it. This\u0027ll - \u0027 He slapped the lamp off the end table, but it didn\u0027t break, merely rolled on the floor. He picked it up, tugged the lead out of the wall socket, raised it over his head and threw it at Andrew, who dodged.\\n\\n \u0027Who\u0027s fucking talked?\u0027 Simon yelled, as the lamp base broke apart on the wall. \u0027Someone\u0027s fucking talked!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s some bastard at the printworks, isn\u0027t it?\u0027 Andrew shouted back; his lip was thick and throbbing; it felt like a tangerine segment. \u0027D\u0027you think we\u0027d have - d\u0027you think we don\u0027t know how to keep our mouths shut by now?\u0027\\n\\n It was like trying to read a wild animal. He could see the muscles working in his father\u0027s jaw, but he could tell that Simon was considering Andrew\u0027s words.\\n\\n \u0027When was that put on there?\u0027 he roared at Ruth. \u0027Look at it! What\u0027s the date on it?\u0027\\n\\n Still sobbing, she peered at the screen, needing to approach the tip of her nose within two inches of it, now that her glasses were broken.\\n\\n \u0027The fifteenth,\u0027 she whispered.\\n\\n \u0027Fifteenth ... Sunday,\u0027 said Simon. \u0027Sunday, wasn\u0027t it?\u0027\\n\\n Neither Andrew nor Ruth put him right. Andrew could not believe his luck; nor did he believe it would hold.\\n\\n \u0027Sunday,\u0027 said Simon, \u0027so anyone could\u0027ve - my fucking toe,\u0027 he yelled, as he pulled himself up and limped exaggeratedly towards Ruth. \u0027Get out of my way!\u0027\\n\\n She hastened out of the chair and watched him read the paragraph through again. He kept snorting like an animal to clear his airways. Andrew thought that he might be able to garrotte his father as he sat there, if only there was a wire to hand.\\n\\n \u0027Someone\u0027s got all this from work,\u0027 said Simon, as if he had just reached this conclusion, and had not heard his wife or son urging the hypothesis on him. He placed his hands on the keyboard and turned to Andrew. \u0027How do I get rid of it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You do fucking computing! How do I get this off here?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You can\u0027t get - you can\u0027t,\u0027 said Andrew. \u0027You\u0027d need to be the administrator.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Make yourself the administrator, then,\u0027 said Simon, jumping up and pointing Andrew into the swivel chair.\\n\\n \u0027I can\u0027t make myself the administrator,\u0027 said Andrew. He was afraid that Simon was working himself up into a second bout of violence. \u0027You need to input the right user name and passwords.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re a real fucking waste of space, aren\u0027t you?\u0027\\n\\n Simon shoved Andrew in the middle of his sternum as he limped past, knocking him back into the mantelpiece.\\n\\n \u0027Pass me the phone!\u0027 Simon shouted at his wife, as he sat back down in the armchair.\\n\\n Ruth took the telephone and carried it the few feet to Simon. He ripped it out of her hands and punched in a number.\\n\\n Andrew and Ruth waited in silence as Simon called, first Jim, and then Tommy, the men with whom he had completed the after-hours jobs at the printworks. Simon\u0027s fury, his suspicion of his own accomplices, was funnelled down the telephone in curt short sentences full of swearwords.\\n\\n Paul had not returned. Perhaps he was still trying to staunch his bleeding nose, but more likely he was too scared. Andrew thought his brother unwise. It was safest to leave only after Simon had given you permission.\\n\\n His calls completed, Simon held out the telephone to Ruth without speaking; she took it and hurried it back into its stand.\\n\\n Simon sat thinking while his fractured toe pulsated, sweating in the heat of the wood-burner, awash with impotent fury. The beating to which he had subjected his wife and son was nothing, he did not give them a thought; a terrible thing had just happened to him, and naturally his rage had exploded on those nearest him; that was how life worked. In any case, Ruth, the silly bitch, had admitted to telling Shirley ...\\n\\n Simon was building his own chain of evidence, as he thought things must have happened. Some fucker (and he suspected that gum-chewing forklift driver, whose expression, as Simon had sped away from him in the Fields, had been outraged) talking about him to the Mollisons (somehow, illogically, Ruth\u0027s admission that she had mentioned the computer to Shirley made this seem more likely), and they (the Mollisons, the establishment, the smooth and the snide, guarding their access to power) had put up this message on their website (Shirley, the old cow, managed the site, which set the seal on the theory).\\n\\n \u0027It\u0027s your fucking friend,\u0027 Simon told his wet-faced, trembling-lipped wife. \u0027It\u0027s your fucking Shirley. She\u0027s done this. She\u0027s got some dirt on me to get me off her son\u0027s case. That\u0027s who it is.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027But Si - \u0027\\n\\n Shut up, shut up, you silly cow, thought Andrew.\\n\\n \u0027Still on her side, are you?\u0027 roared Simon, making to stand again.\\n\\n \u0027No!\u0027 squealed Ruth, and he sank back into the chair, glad to keep the weight off his pounding foot.\\n\\n The Harcourt-Walsh management would not be happy about those after-hours jobs, Simon thought. He wouldn\u0027t put it past the bloody police to come nosing around the computer. A desire for urgent action filled him.\\n\\n \u0027You,\u0027 he said, pointing at Andrew. \u0027Unplug that computer. All of it, the leads and everything. You\u0027re coming with me.\u0027 \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-casual-vacancy/page-22.html","bookId":2230,"book":{"id":2230,"title":"The Casual Vacancy","description":"Storyline: When Barry Fairbrother dies unexpectedly in his early forties, the little town of Pagford is left in shock.
