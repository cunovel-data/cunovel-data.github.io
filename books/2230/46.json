She drank cold water from the tap in the bathroom until she felt sick, gulped down two paracetamol from the cabinet over the sink, then took a shower.\\n\\n She dressed without looking at herself in the mirror. Through everything she did, she was alert for some noise that would indicate the whereabouts of Miles, but the house seemed to be silent. Perhaps, she thought, he had taken Lexie out somewhere, away from her drunken, lecherous, cradle-snatching mother ...\\n\\n (\u0027He was in Lexie\u0027s class at school!\u0027 Miles had spat at her, once they were alone in their bedroom. She had waited for him to move away from the door, then wrenched it back open and run to the spare room.)\\n\\n Nausea and mortification came over her in waves. She wished she could forget, that she had blacked out, but she could still see the boy\u0027s face as she launched herself at him ... she could remember the feel of his body pressed against her, so skinny, so young ...\\n\\n If it had been Vikram Jawanda, there might have been some dignity in it ... She had to get coffee. She could not stay in the bathroom for ever. But as she turned to open the door, she saw herself in the mirror, and her courage almost failed. Her face was puffy, her eyes hooded, the lines in her face etched more deeply by pressure and dehydration.\\n\\n Oh God, what must he have thought of me ...\\n\\n Miles was sitting in the kitchen when she entered. She did not look at him, but crossed straight to the cupboard where the coffee was. Before she had touched the handle, he said, \u0027I\u0027ve got some here.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Thanks,\u0027 she muttered, and poured herself out a mug, avoiding eye contact.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ve sent Lexie over to Mum and Dad\u0027s,\u0027 said Miles. \u0027We need to talk.\u0027\\n\\n Samantha sat down at the kitchen table.\\n\\n \u0027Go on, then,\u0027 she said.\\n\\n \u0027Go on - is that all you can say?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027re the one who wants to talk.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Last night,\u0027 said Miles, \u0027at my father\u0027s birthday party, I came to look for you, and I found you snogging a sixteen-year - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027Sixteen-year-old, yes,\u0027 said Samantha. \u0027Legal. One good thing.\u0027\\n\\n He stared at her, appalled.\\n\\n \u0027You think this is funny? If you\u0027d found me so drunk that I didn\u0027t even realize - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027I did realize,\u0027 said Samantha.\\n\\n She refused to be Shirley, to cover everything up with a frilly little tablecloth of polite fiction. She wanted to be honest, and she wanted to penetrate that thick coating of complacency through which she no longer recognized a young man she had loved.\\n\\n \u0027You did realize - what?\u0027 said Miles.\\n\\n He had so plainly expected embarrassment and contrition that she almost laughed.\\n\\n \u0027I did realize that I was kissing him,\u0027 she said.\\n\\n He stared at her, and her courage seeped away, because she knew what he was going to say next.\\n\\n \u0027And if Lexie had walked in?\u0027\\n\\n Samantha had no answer to that. The thought of Lexie knowing what had happened made her want to run away and not come back - and what if the boy told her? They had been at school together. She had forgotten what Pagford was like ...\\n\\n \u0027What the hell\u0027s going on with you?\u0027 asked Miles.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m ... unhappy,\u0027 said Samantha.\\n\\n \u0027Why?\u0027 asked Miles, but then he added quickly, \u0027Is it the shop? Is it that?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027A bit,\u0027 said Samantha. \u0027But I hate living in Pagford. I hate living on top of your parents. And sometimes,\u0027 she said slowly, \u0027I hate waking up next to you.\u0027\\n\\n She thought he might get angry, but instead he asked, quite calmly, \u0027Are you saying you don\u0027t love me any more?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t know,\u0027 said Samantha.\\n\\n \u0027Maybe he\u0027ll be the first of many!\u0027 yelled Samantha, getting up from the table and slamming her mug down in the sink; the handle came off in her hand. \u0027Don\u0027t you get it, Miles? I\u0027ve had enough! I hate our fucking life and I hate your fucking parents - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027 - you don\u0027t mind them paying for the girls\u0027 education - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027 - I hate you turning into your father in front of me - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027 - absolute bollocks, you just don\u0027t like me being happy when you\u0027re not - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027 - whereas my darling husband doesn\u0027t give a shit how I feel - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027 - plenty for you to do round here, but you\u0027d rather sit at home and sulk - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027 - I don\u0027t intend to sit at home any more, Miles - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027 - not going to apologize for getting involved with the community - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027 - well, I meant what I said - you\u0027re not fit to fill his shoes!\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027 he said, and his chair fell over as he jumped to his feet, while Samantha strode to the kitchen door.\\n\\n \u0027You heard me,\u0027 she shouted. \u0027Like my letter said, Miles, you\u0027re not fit to fill Barry Fairbrother\u0027s shoes. He was sincere.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Your letter?\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \u0027Yep,\u0027 she said breathlessly, with her hand on the doorknob. \u0027I sent that letter. Too much to drink one evening, while you were on the phone to your mother. And,\u0027 she pulled the door open, \u0027I didn\u0027t vote for you either.\u0027\\n\\n The look on his face unnerved her. Out in the hall, she slipped on clogs, the first pair of shoes she could find, and was through the front door before he could catch up. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-casual-vacancy/page-46.html","bookId":2230,"book":{"id":2230,"title":"The Casual Vacancy","description":"Storyline: When Barry Fairbrother dies unexpectedly in his early forties, the little town of Pagford is left in shock.

Rich at war with poor, teenagers at war with their parents, wives at war with their husbands, teachers at war with their pupils. Pagford is not what it first seems. And the empty seat left by Barry on the town\u0027s council soon becomes the catalyst for the biggest war the town has yet seen. Who will triumph in an election fraught with passion, duplicity and unexpected revelations? Blackly comic, thought-provoking and constantly surprising, The Casual Vacancy is J.K.
