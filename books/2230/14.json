{"id":107515,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"VII Once the first impulse of spite had worn off, Samantha bitterly regretted inviting Gavin and Kay to dinner. She spent Friday morning joking with her assistant about the dreadful evening she was bound to have, but her mood plummeted once she had left Carly in charge of Over the Shoulder Boulder Holders (a name that had made Howard laugh so hard the first time he had heard it that it had brought on an asthma attack, and which made Shirley scowl whenever it was spoken in her presence). Driving back to Pagford ahead of the rush hour, so that she could shop for ingredients and start cooking, Samantha tried to cheer herself up by thinking of nasty questions to ask Gavin. Perhaps she might wonder aloud why Kay had not moved in with him: that would be a good one. Walking home from the Square with bulging Mollison and Lowe carrier bags in each hand, she came across Mary Fairbrother beside the cash-point machine in the wall of Barry\u0027s bank. \u0027Mary, hi ... how are you?\u0027 Mary was thin and pale, with grey patches around her eyes. Their conversation was stilted and strange. They had not spoken since the journey in the ambulance, barring brief, awkward condolences at the funeral. \u0027I\u0027ve been meaning to drop in,\u0027 Mary said, \u0027you were so kind - and I wanted to thank Miles - \u0027 \u0027No need,\u0027 Samantha said awkwardly. \u0027Oh, but I\u0027d like - \u0027 \u0027Oh, but then, please do - \u0027 After Mary had walked away, Samantha had the awful feeling that she might have given the impression that that evening would be a perfect time for Mary to come round. Once home, she dropped the bags in the hall and telephoned Miles at work to tell him what she had done, but he displayed an infuriating equanimity about the prospect of adding a newly widowed woman to their foursome. \u0027I can\u0027t see what the problem is, really,\u0027 he said. \u0027Nice for Mary to get out.\u0027 \u0027But I didn\u0027t say we were having Gavin and Kay over - \u0027 \u0027Mary likes Gav,\u0027 said Miles. \u0027I wouldn\u0027t worry about it.\u0027 He was, Samantha thought, being deliberately obtuse, no doubt in retaliation for her refusal to go to Sweetlove House. After she had hung up, she wondered whether to call Mary to tell her not to come that evening, but she was afraid of sounding rude, and settled for hoping that Mary would find herself unequal to calling in after all. Stalking into the sitting room, she put on Libby\u0027s boy band DVD at full volume so that she would be able to hear it in the kitchen, then carried the bags through and set to work preparing a casserole and her fall-back pudding, Mississippi mud pie. She would have liked to buy one of Mollison and Lowe\u0027s large gateaux, to save herself some work, but it would have got straight back to Shirley, who frequently intimated that Samantha was over-reliant on frozen food and ready meals. Samantha knew the boy band DVD so well by now that she was able to visualize the images matching the music blaring through to the kitchen. Several times that week, while Miles was upstairs in his home study or on the telephone to Howard, she had watched it again. When she heard the opening bars of the track where the muscular boy walked, with his shirt flapping open, along the beach, she went through to watch in her apron, absent-mindedly sucking her chocolatey fingers. She had planned on having a long shower while Miles laid the table, forgetting that he would be late home, because he had to drive into Yarvil to pick up the girls from St Anne\u0027s. When Samantha realized why he had not returned, and that their daughters would be with him when he did, she had to fly around to organize the dining room herself, then find something to feed Lexie and Libby before the guests arrived. Miles found his wife in her work clothes at half-past seven, sweaty, cross and inclined to blame him for what had been her own idea. Fourteen-year-old Libby marched into the sitting room without greeting Samantha and removed the disc from the DVD player. \u0027Oh, good, I was wondering what I\u0027d done with that,\u0027 she said. \u0027Why\u0027s the TV on? Have you been playing it?\u0027 Sometimes, Samantha thought that her younger daughter had a look of Shirley about her. \u0027I was watching the news, Libby. I haven\u0027t got time to watch DVDs. Come through, your pizza\u0027s ready. We\u0027ve got people coming round.\u0027 \u0027Frozen pizza again?\u0027 \u0027Miles! I need to change. Can you mash the potatoes for me? Miles?\u0027 But he had disappeared upstairs, so Samantha pounded the potatoes herself, while her daughters ate at the island in the middle of the kitchen. Libby had propped the DVD cover against her glass of Diet Pepsi, and was ogling it. \u0027Mikey\u0027s so lush,\u0027 she said, with a carnal groan that took Samantha aback; but the muscular boy was called Jake. Samantha was glad they did not like the same one. Loud and confident Lexie was jabbering about school; a machine-gun torrent of information about girls whom Samantha did not know, with whose antics and feuds and regroupings she could not keep up. \u0027All right, you two, I\u0027ve got to change. Clear away when you\u0027re done, all right?\u0027 She turned down the heat under the casserole and hurried upstairs. Miles was buttoning up his shirt in the bedroom, watching himself in the wardrobe mirror. The whole room smelt of soap and aftershave. \u0027Everything under control, hon?\u0027 \u0027Yes, thanks. So glad you\u0027ve had time to shower,\u0027 spat Samantha, pulling out her favourite long skirt and top, slamming the wardrobe door. \u0027You could have one now.\u0027 \u0027They\u0027ll be here in ten minutes; I won\u0027t have time to dry my hair and put on make-up.\u0027 She kicked off her shoes; one of them hit the radiator with a loud clang. \u0027When you\u0027ve finished preening, could you please go downstairs and sort out drinks?\u0027 After Miles had left the room, she tried to untangle her thick hair and repair her make-up. She looked awful. Only when she had changed did she realize that she was wearing the wrong bra for her clinging top. After a frantic search, she remembered that the right one was drying in the utility room; she hurried out onto the landing but the doorbell rang. Swearing, she scuttled back to the bedroom. The boy band\u0027s music was blaring out of Libby\u0027s room. Gavin and Kay had arrived on the dot of eight because Gavin was afraid of what Samantha might say if they turned up late; he could imagine her suggesting that they had lost track of time because they were shagging or that they must have had a row. She seemed to think that one of the perks of marriage was that it gave you rights of comment and intrusion over single people\u0027s love lives. She also thought that her crass, uninhibited way of talking, especially when drunk, constituted trenchant humour. \u0027Hello-ello-ello,\u0027 said Miles, moving back to let Gavin and Kay inside. \u0027Come in, come in. Welcome to Casa Mollison.\u0027 He kissed Kay on both cheeks and relieved her of the chocolates she was holding. \u0027For us? Thanks very much. Lovely to meet you properly at last. Gav\u0027s been keeping you under wraps for far too long.\u0027 Miles shook the wine out of Gavin\u0027s hand, then clapped him on the back, which Gavin resented. \u0027Come on through, Sam\u0027ll be down in a mo. What\u0027ll you have to drink?\u0027 Kay would ordinarily have found Miles rather smooth and over-familiar, but she was determined to suspend judgement. Couples had to mix with each other\u0027s circles, and manage to get along in them. This evening represented significant progress in her quest to infiltrate the layers of his life to which Gavin had never admitted her, and she wanted to show him that she was at home in the Mollisons\u0027 big, smug house, that there was no need to exclude her any more. So she smiled at Miles, asked for a red wine, and admired the spacious room with its stripped pine floorboards, its over-cushioned sofa and its framed prints. \u0027Been here for, ooh, getting on for fourteen years,\u0027 said Miles, busy with the corkscrew. \u0027You\u0027re down in Hope Street, aren\u0027t you? Nice little houses, some great fixer-upper opportunities down there.\u0027 Samantha appeared, smiling without warmth. Kay, who had previously seen her only in an overcoat, noted the tightness of her orange top, beneath which every detail of her lacy bra was clearly visible. Her face was even darker than her leathery chest; her eye make-up was thick and unflattering and her jangling gold earrings and high-heeled golden mules were, in Kay\u0027s opinion, tarty. Samantha struck her as the kind of woman who would have raucous girls\u0027 nights out, and find stripograms hilarious, and flirt drunkenly with everyone else\u0027s partner at parties. \u0027Hi there,\u0027 said Samantha. She kissed Gavin and smiled at Kay. \u0027Great, you\u0027ve got drinks. I\u0027ll have the same as Kay, Miles.\u0027 She turned away to sit down, having already taken stock of the other woman\u0027s appearance: Kay was small-breasted and heavy-hipped, and had certainly chosen her black trousers to minimize the size of her bottom. She would have done better, in Samantha\u0027s opinion, to wear heels, given the shortness of her legs. Her face was attractive enough, with even-toned olive skin, large dark eyes and a generous mouth; but the closely cropped boy\u0027s hair and the resolutely flat shoes were undoubtedly pointers to certain sacrosanct Beliefs. Gavin had done it again: he had gone and picked another humourless, domineering woman who would make his life a misery. \u0027So!\u0027 said Samantha brightly, raising her glass. \u0027Gavin-and-Kay!\u0027 She saw, with satisfaction, Gavin\u0027s hangdog wince of a smile; but before she could make him squirm more or weasel private information out of them both to dangle over Shirley\u0027s and Maureen\u0027s heads, the doorbell rang again. Mary appeared fragile and angular, especially beside Miles, who ushered her into the room. Her T-shirt hung from protruding collarbones. \u0027Oh,\u0027 she said, coming to a startled halt on the threshold. \u0027I didn\u0027t realize you were having - \u0027 \u0027Gavin and Kay just dropped in,\u0027 said Samantha a little wildly. \u0027Come in, Mary, please ... have a drink ...\u0027 \u0027Mary, this is Kay,\u0027 said Miles. \u0027Kay, this is Mary Fairbrother.\u0027 \u0027Oh,\u0027 said Kay, thrown; she had thought that it would only be the four of them. \u0027Yes, hello.\u0027 Gavin, who could tell that Mary had not meant to drop in on a dinner party and was on the point of walking straight back out again, patted the sofa beside him; Mary sat down with a weak smile. He was overjoyed to see her. Here was his buffer; even Samantha must realize that her particular brand of prurience would be inappropriate in front of a bereaved woman; plus, the constrictive symmetry of a foursome had been broken up. \u0027How are you?\u0027 he said quietly. \u0027I was going to give you a ring, actually ... there\u0027ve been developments with the insurance ...\u0027 \u0027Haven\u0027t we got any nibbles, Sam?\u0027 asked Miles. Samantha walked from the room, seething at Miles. The smell of scorched meat met her as she opened the kitchen door. \u0027Oh shit, shit, shit ...\u0027 She had completely forgotten the casserole, which had dried out. Desiccated chunks of meat and vegetables sat, forlorn survivors of the catastrophe, on the singed bottom of the pot. Samantha sloshed in wine and stock, chiselling the adhering bits off the pan with her spoon, stirring vigorously, sweating in the heat. Miles\u0027 high-pitched laugh rang out from the sitting room. Samantha put on long-stemmed broccoli to steam, drained her glass of wine, ripped open a bag of tortilla chips and a tub of hummus, and upended them into bowls. Mary and Gavin were still conversing quietly on the sofa when she returned to the sitting room, while Miles was showing Kay a framed aerial photograph of Pagford, and giving her a lesson in the town\u0027s history. Samantha set down the bowls on the coffee table, poured herself another drink and settled into the armchair, making no effort to join either conversation. It was awfully uncomfortable to have Mary there; with her grief hanging so heavily around her she might as well have walked in trailing a shroud. Surely, though, she would leave before dinner. Gavin was determined that Mary should stay. As they discussed the latest developments in their ongoing battle with the insurance company, he felt much more relaxed and in control than he usually did in Miles and Samantha\u0027s presence. Nobody was chipping away at him, or patronizing him, and Miles was absolving him temporarily of all responsibility for Kay. \u0027... and just here, just out of sight,\u0027 Miles was saying, pointing to a spot two inches past the frame of the picture, \u0027you\u0027ve got Sweetlove House, the Fawley place. Big Queen Anne manor house, dormers, stone quoins ... stunning, you should visit, it\u0027s open to the public on Sundays in the summer. Important family locally, the Fawleys.\u0027 \u0027Stone quoins?\u0027 \u0027Important family, locally?\u0027 God, you are an arse, Miles. Samantha hoisted herself out of her armchair and returned to the kitchen. Though the casserole was watery, the burnt flavour dominated. The broccoli was flaccid and tasteless; the mashed potato cool and dry. Past caring, she decanted it all into dishes and slammed it down on the circular dining-room table. \u0027Dinner\u0027s ready!\u0027 she called at the sitting-room door. \u0027Oh, I must go,\u0027 said Mary, jumping up. \u0027I didn\u0027t mean - \u0027 \u0027No, no, no!\u0027 said Gavin, in a tone that Kay had never heard before: kindly and cajoling. \u0027It\u0027ll do you good to eat - kids\u0027ll be all right for an hour.\u0027 Miles added his support and Mary looked uncertainly towards Samantha, who was forced to add her voice to theirs, then dashed back through into the dining room to lay another setting. She invited Mary to sit between Gavin and Miles, because placing her next to a woman seemed to emphasize her husband\u0027s absence. Kay and Miles had moved on to discussing social work. \u0027I don\u0027t envy you,\u0027 he said, serving Kay a large ladle full of casserole; Samantha could see black, scorched flecks in the sauce spreading across the white plate. \u0027Bloody difficult job.\u0027 \u0027Well, we\u0027re perennially under-resourced,\u0027 said Kay, \u0027but it can be satisfying, especially when you can feel you\u0027re making a difference.\u0027 And she thought of the Weedons. Terri\u0027s urine sample had tested negative at the clinic yesterday and Robbie had had a full week in nursery. The recollection cheered her, counterbalancing her slight irritation that Gavin\u0027s attention was still focused entirely on Mary; that he was doing nothing to help ease her conversation with his friends. \u0027You\u0027ve got a daughter, haven\u0027t you, Kay?\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s right: Gaia. She\u0027s sixteen.\u0027 \u0027Same age as Lexie; we should get them together,\u0027 said Miles. \u0027Divorced?\u0027 asked Samantha delicately. \u0027No,\u0027 said Kay. \u0027We weren\u0027t married. He was a university boyfriend and we split up not long after she was born.\u0027 \u0027Yeah, Miles and I had barely left university ourselves,\u0027 said Samantha. Kay did not know whether Samantha meant to draw a distinction between herself, who had married the big smug father of her children, and Kay, who had been left ... not that Samantha could know that Brendan had left her ... \u0027Gaia\u0027s taken a Saturday job with your father, actually,\u0027 Kay told Miles. \u0027At the new cafe.\u0027 Miles was delighted. He took enormous pleasure in the idea that he and Howard were so much part of the fabric of the place that everybody in Pagford was connected to them, whether as friend or client, customer or employee. Gavin, who was chewing and chewing on a bit of rubbery meat that was refusing to yield to his teeth, experienced a further lowering in the pit of his stomach. It was news to him that Gaia had taken a job with Miles\u0027 father. Somehow he had forgotten that Kay possessed in Gaia another powerful device for anchoring herself to Pagford. When not in the immediate vicinity of her slamming doors, her vicious looks and caustic asides, Gavin tended to forget that Gaia had any independent existence at all; that she was not simply part of the uncomfortable backdrop of stale sheets, bad cooking and festering grudges against which his relationship with Kay staggered on. \u0027Does Gaia like Pagford?\u0027 Samantha asked. \u0027Well, it\u0027s a bit quiet compared to Hackney,\u0027 said Kay, \u0027but she\u0027s settling in well.\u0027 She took a large gulp of wine to wash out her mouth after disgorging the enormous lie. There had been yet another row before leaving tonight. (\u0027What\u0027s the matter with you?\u0027 Kay had asked, while Gaia sat at the kitchen table, hunched over her laptop, wearing a dressing gown over her clothes. Four or five boxes of dialogue were open on the screen. Kay knew that Gaia was communicating online with the friends she had left behind in Hackney, friends she had had, in most cases, since she had been in primary school. \u0027Gaia?\u0027 Refusal to answer was new and ominous. Kay was used to explosions of bile and rage against herself and, particularly, Gavin. \u0027Gaia, I\u0027m talking to you.\u0027 \u0027I know, I can hear you.\u0027 \u0027Then kindly have the courtesy to answer me back.\u0027 Black dialogue jerked upwards in the boxes on the screen, funny little icons, blinking and waggling. \u0027Gaia, please will you answer me?\u0027 \u0027What? What do you want?\u0027 \u0027I\u0027m trying to ask about your day.\u0027 \u0027My day was shit. Yesterday was shit. Tomorrow will be shit as well.\u0027 \u0027When did you get home?\u0027 \u0027The same time I always get home.\u0027 Sometimes, even after all these years, Gaia displayed resentment at having to let herself in, at Kay not being at home to meet her like a storybook mother. \u0027Do you want to tell me why your day was shit?\u0027 \u0027Because you dragged me to live in a shithole.\u0027 Kay willed herself not to shout. Lately there had been screaming matches that she was sure the whole street had heard. \u0027You know that I\u0027m going out with Gavin tonight?\u0027 Gaia muttered something Kay did not catch. \u0027What?\u0027 \u0027I said, I didn\u0027t think he liked taking you out.\u0027 \u0027What\u0027s that supposed to mean?\u0027 But Gaia did not answer; she simply typed a response into one of the scrolling conversations on the screen. Kay vacillated, both wanting to press her and afraid of what she might hear. \u0027We\u0027ll be back around midnight, I expect.\u0027 Gaia had not responded. Kay had gone to wait for Gavin in the hall.) \u0027Gaia\u0027s made friends,\u0027 Kay told Miles, \u0027with a girl who lives in this street; what\u0027s her name - Narinder?\u0027 \u0027Sukhvinder,\u0027 said Miles and Samantha together. \u0027She\u0027s a nice girl,\u0027 said Mary. \u0027Have you met her father?\u0027 Samantha asked Kay. \u0027No,\u0027 said Kay. \u0027He\u0027s a heart surgeon,\u0027 said Samantha, who was on her fourth glass of wine. \u0027Absolutely bloody gorgeous.\u0027 \u0027Oh,\u0027 said Kay. \u0027Like a Bollywood film star.\u0027 None of them, Samantha reflected, had bothered to tell her that dinner was tasty, which would have been simple politeness, even though it was awful. If she wasn\u0027t allowed to torment Gavin, she ought at least to be able to needle Miles. \u0027Vikram\u0027s the only good thing about living in this godforsaken town, I can tell you,\u0027 said Samantha. \u0027Sex on legs.\u0027 \u0027And his wife\u0027s our local GP,\u0027 said Miles, \u0027and a parish councillor. You\u0027ll be employed by Yarvil District Council, Kay, are you?\u0027 \u0027That\u0027s right,\u0027 said Kay. \u0027But I spend most of my time in the Fields. They\u0027re technically in Pagford Parish, aren\u0027t they?\u0027 Not the Fields, thought Samantha, Oh, don\u0027t mention the bloody Fields. \u0027Ah,\u0027 said Miles, with a meaningful smile. \u0027Yes, well, the Fields do belong to Pagford, technically. Technically, they do. Painful subject, Kay.\u0027 \u0027Really? Why?\u0027 asked Kay, hoping to make conversation general, because Gavin was still talking in an undertone to the widow. \u0027Well, you see - this is back in the fifties.\u0027 Miles seemed to be embarking on a well-rehearsed speech. \u0027Yarvil wanted to expand the Cantermill Estate, and instead of building out to the west, where the bypass is now - \u0027 \u0027Gavin? Mary? More wine?\u0027 Samantha called over Miles. \u0027 - they were a little bit duplicitous; land was bought without it being very clear what they wanted it for, and then they went and expanded the estate over the border into Pagford Parish.\u0027 \u0027Why aren\u0027t you mentioning Old Aubrey Fawley, Miles?\u0027 asked Samantha. She had, at last, reached that delicious point of intoxication where her tongue became wicked and she became disengaged from fear of consequences, eager to provoke and to irritate, seeking nothing but her own amusement. \u0027The truth is that Old Aubrey Fawley, who used to own all those lovely stone quoits, or whatever Miles was telling you about, did a deal behind everyone\u0027s backs - \u0027 \u0027That\u0027s not fair, Sam,\u0027 said Miles, but she talked over him again. \u0027 - he flogged off the land where the Fields are built, pocketed, I don\u0027t know, must have been a quarter of a mill or so - \u0027 \u0027Don\u0027t talk rubbish, Sam, back in the fifties?\u0027 \u0027 - but then, once he realized everyone was pissed off with him, he pretended he hadn\u0027t known it would cause trouble. Upper-class twit. And a drunk,\u0027 added Samantha. \u0027Simply not true, I\u0027m afraid,\u0027 Miles said firmly. \u0027To fully understand the problem, Kay, you need to appreciate a bit of local history.\u0027 Samantha, holding her chin in her hand, pretended to slide her elbow off the table in boredom. Though she could not like Samantha, Kay laughed, and Gavin and Mary broke off their quiet conversation. \u0027We\u0027re talking about the Fields,\u0027 said Kay, in a tone intended to remind Gavin that she was there; that he ought to be giving her moral support. Miles, Samantha and Gavin realized simultaneously that the Fields was a most tactless subject to raise in front of Mary, when they had been such a bone of contention between Barry and Howard. \u0027Apparently they\u0027re a bit of a sore subject locally,\u0027 said Kay, wanting to force Gavin to express a view, to rope him in. \u0027Mmm,\u0027 he replied, and turning back to Mary, he said, \u0027So how\u0027s Declan\u0027s football coming on?\u0027 Kay experienced a powerful stab of fury: Mary might be recently bereaved, but Gavin\u0027s solicitousness seemed unnecessarily pointed. She had imagined this evening quite differently: a foursome in which Gavin would have to acknowledge that they really were a couple; yet nobody looking on would imagine that they enjoyed a closer relationship than acquaintanceship. Also, the food was horrible. Kay put her knife and fork together with three-quarters of her helping untouched - an act that was not lost on Samantha - and addressed Miles again. \u0027Did you grow up in Pagford?\u0027 \u0027Afraid so,\u0027 said Miles, smiling complacently. \u0027Born in the old Kelland Hospital along the road. They closed it in the eighties.\u0027 \u0027And you? - \u0027 Kay asked Samantha, who cut across her. \u0027God, no. I\u0027m here by accident.\u0027 \u0027Sorry, I don\u0027t know what you do, Samantha?\u0027 asked Kay. \u0027I\u0027ve got my own busi - \u0027 \u0027She sells outsize bras,\u0027 said Miles. Samantha got up abruptly and went to fetch another bottle of wine. When she returned to the table, Miles was telling Kay the humorous anecdote, doubtless intended to illustrate how everyone knew everyone in Pagford, of how he had been pulled over in the car one night by a policeman who turned out to be a friend he had known since primary school. The blow-by-blow re-enactment of the banter between himself and Steve Edwards was tediously familiar to Samantha. As she moved around the table replenishing all the glasses, she watched Kay\u0027s austere expression; evidently, Kay did not find drink-driving a laughing matter. \u0027... so Steve\u0027s holding out the breathalyser, and I\u0027m about to blow in it, and out of nowhere we both start cracking up. His partner\u0027s got no idea what the hell\u0027s going on; he\u0027s like this\u0027 - Miles mimed a man turning his head from side to side in astonishment - \u0027and Steve\u0027s bent double, pissing himself, because all we can think of is the last time he was holding something steady for me to blow into, which was nigh on twenty years ago, and - \u0027 \u0027It was a blow-up doll,\u0027 said Samantha, unsmiling, dropping back into her seat beside Miles. \u0027Miles and Steve put it in their friend Ian\u0027s parents\u0027 bed, during Ian\u0027s eighteenth-birthday party. Anyway, in the end Miles was fined a grand and got three points on his licence, because it was the second time he\u0027d been caught over the limit. So that was hysterically funny.\u0027 Miles\u0027 grin remained foolishly in place, like a limp balloon forgotten after a party. A stiff little chill seemed to blow through the temporarily silent room. Though Miles struck her as an almighty bore, Kay was on his side: he was the only one at the table who seemed remotely inclined to ease her passage into Pagford social life. \u0027I must say, the Fields are pretty rough,\u0027 she said, reverting to the subject with which Miles seemed most comfortable, and still ignorant that it was in any way inauspicious within Mary\u0027s vicinity. \u0027I\u0027ve worked in the inner cities; I didn\u0027t expect to see that kind of deprivation in a rural area, but it\u0027s not all that different from London. Less of an ethnic mix, of course.\u0027 \u0027Oh, yes, we\u0027ve got our share of addicts and wasters,\u0027 said Miles. \u0027I think that\u0027s about all I can manage, Sam,\u0027 he added, pushing his plate away from him with a sizeable amount of food still on it. Samantha started to clear the table; Mary got up to help. \u0027No, no, it\u0027s fine, Mary, you relax,\u0027 Samantha said. To Kay\u0027s annoyance, Gavin jumped up too, chivalrously insisting on Mary\u0027s sitting back down, but Mary insisted too. \u0027That was lovely, Sam,\u0027 said Mary, in the kitchen, as they scraped most of the food into the bin. \u0027No, it wasn\u0027t, it was horrible,\u0027 said Samantha, who was only appreciating how drunk she was now that she was on her feet. \u0027What do you think of Kay?\u0027 \u0027I don\u0027t know. She\u0027s not what I expected,\u0027 said Mary. \u0027She\u0027s exactly what I expected,\u0027 said Samantha, taking out plates for pudding. \u0027She\u0027s another Lisa, if you ask me.\u0027 \u0027Oh, no, don\u0027t say that,\u0027 said Mary. \u0027He deserves someone nice this time.\u0027 This was a most novel point of view to Samantha, who was of the opinion that Gavin\u0027s wetness merited constant punishment. They returned to the dining room to find an animated conversation in progress between Kay and Miles, while Gavin sat in silence. \u0027... offload responsibility for them, which seems to me to be a pretty self-centred and self-satisfied - \u0027 \u0027Well, I think it\u0027s interesting that you use the word \"responsibility\",\u0027 said Miles, \u0027because I think that goes to the very heart of the problem, doesn\u0027t it? The question is, where exactly do we draw the line?\u0027 \u0027Beyond the Fields, apparently.\u0027 Kay laughed, with condescension. \u0027You want to draw a line neatly between the home-owning middle classes and the lower - \u0027 \u0027Pagford\u0027s full of working-class people, Kay; the difference is, most of them work. D\u0027you know what proportion of the Fields lives off benefits? Responsibility, you say: what happened to personal responsibility? We\u0027ve had them through the local school for years: kids who haven\u0027t got a single worker in the family; the concept of earning a living is completely foreign to them; generations of non-workers, and we\u0027re expected to subsidize them - \u0027 \u0027So your solution is to shunt off the problem onto Yarvil,\u0027 said Kay, \u0027not to engage with any of the underlying - \u0027 \u0027Mississippi mud pie?\u0027 called Samantha. Gavin and Mary took slices with thanks; Kay, to Samantha\u0027s fury, simply held out her plate as though Samantha were a waitress, her attention all on Miles. \u0027... the addiction clinic, which is absolutely crucial, and which certain people are apparently lobbying to close - \u0027 \u0027Oh, well, if you\u0027re talking about Bellchapel,\u0027 said Miles, shaking his head and smirking, \u0027I hope you\u0027ve mugged up on what the success rates are, Kay. Pathetic, frankly, absolutely pathetic. I\u0027ve seen the figures, I was going through them this morning, and I won\u0027t lie to you, the sooner they close - \u0027 \u0027And the figures you\u0027re talking about are ...?\u0027 \u0027Success rates, Kay, exactly what I said: the number of people who have actually stopped using drugs, gone clean - \u0027 \u0027I\u0027m sorry, but that\u0027s a very naive point of view; if you\u0027re going to judge success purely - \u0027 \u0027But how on earth else are we supposed to judge an addiction clinic\u0027s success?\u0027 demanded Miles, incredulous. \u0027As far as I can tell, all they do at Bellchapel is dole out methadone, which half of their clients use alongside heroin anyway.\u0027 \u0027The whole problem of addiction is immensely complicated,\u0027 said Kay, \u0027and it\u0027s naive and simplistic to put the problem purely in terms of users and non ...\u0027 But Miles was shaking his head, smiling; Kay, who had been enjoying her verbal duel with this self-satisfied lawyer, was suddenly angry. \u0027Well, I can give you a very concrete example of what Bellchapel\u0027s doing: one family I\u0027m working with - mother, teenage daughter and small son - if the mother wasn\u0027t on methadone, she\u0027d be on the streets trying to pay for her habit; the kids are immeasurably better off - \u0027 \u0027They\u0027d be better off away from their mother, by the sound of it,\u0027 said Miles. \u0027And where exactly would you propose they go?\u0027 \u0027A decent foster home would be a good start,\u0027 said Miles. \u0027Do you know how many foster homes there are, against how many kids needing them?\u0027 asked Kay. \u0027The best solution would have been to have them adopted at birth - \u0027 \u0027Fabulous. I\u0027ll hop in my time machine,\u0027 retorted Kay. \u0027Well, we know a couple who were desperate to adopt,\u0027 said Samantha, unexpectedly throwing her weight behind Miles. She would not forgive Kay for the rude outstretched plate; the woman was bolshy and patronizing, exactly like Lisa, who had monopolized every get-together with her political views and her job in family law, despising Samantha for owning a bra shop. \u0027Adam and Janice,\u0027 she reminded Miles in parenthesis, who nodded; \u0027and they couldn\u0027t get a baby for love nor money, could they?\u0027 \u0027Yes, a baby,\u0027 said Kay, rolling her eyes, \u0027everybody wants a baby. Robbie\u0027s nearly four. He\u0027s not potty-trained, he\u0027s developmentally behind for his age and he\u0027s almost certainly had inappropriate exposure to sexual behaviour. Would your friends like to adopt him?\u0027 \u0027But the point is, if he\u0027d been taken from his mother at birth - \u0027 \u0027She was off the drugs when he was born, and making good progress,\u0027 said Kay. \u0027She loved him and wanted to keep him, and she was meeting his needs at the time. She\u0027d already raised Krystal, with some family support - \u0027 \u0027Krystal!\u0027 shrieked Samantha. \u0027Oh my God, are we talking about the Weedons?\u0027 Kay was horrified that she had used names; it had never mattered in London, but everyone truly did know everyone in Pagford, it seemed. \u0027I shouldn\u0027t have - \u0027 But Miles and Samantha were laughing, and Mary looked tense. Kay, who had not touched her pie, and had managed very little of the first course, realized that she had drunk too much; she had been sipping wine steadily out of nerves, and now she had committed a prime indiscretion. Still, it was too late to undo that; anger overrode every other consideration. \u0027Krystal Weedon is no advert for that woman\u0027s mothering skills,\u0027 said Miles. \u0027Krystal\u0027s trying her damnedest to hold her family together,\u0027 said Kay. \u0027She loves her little brother very much; she\u0027s terrified he\u0027ll be taken away - \u0027 \u0027I wouldn\u0027t trust Krystal Weedon to look after a boiling egg,\u0027 said Miles, and Samantha laughed again. \u0027Oh, look, it\u0027s to her credit she loves her brother, but he isn\u0027t a cuddly toy - \u0027 \u0027Yes, I know that,\u0027 snapped Kay, remembering Robbie\u0027s shitty, crusted bottom, \u0027but he\u0027s still loved.\u0027 \u0027Krystal bullied our daughter Lexie,\u0027 said Samantha, \u0027so we\u0027ve seen a different side of her to the one I\u0027m sure she shows you.\u0027 \u0027Look, we all know Krystal\u0027s had a rough deal,\u0027 said Miles, \u0027nobody\u0027s denying that. It\u0027s the drug-addled mother I\u0027ve got an issue with.\u0027 \u0027As a matter of fact, she\u0027s doing very well on the Bellchapel programme at the moment.\u0027 \u0027But with her history,\u0027 said Miles, \u0027it isn\u0027t rocket science, is it, to guess that she\u0027ll relapse?\u0027 \u0027If you apply that rule across the board, you ought not to have a driving licence, because with your history you\u0027re bound to drink and drive again.\u0027 Miles was temporarily baffled, but Samantha said coldly, \u0027I think that\u0027s a rather different thing.\u0027 \u0027Do you?\u0027 said Kay. \u0027It\u0027s the same principle.\u0027 \u0027Yes, well, principles are sometimes the problem, if you ask me,\u0027 said Miles. \u0027Often what\u0027s needed is a bit of common sense.\u0027 \u0027Which is the name people usually give to their prejudices,\u0027 rejoined Kay. \u0027According to Nietzsche,\u0027 said a sharp new voice, making them all jump, \u0027philosophy is the biography of the philosopher.\u0027 A miniature Samantha stood at the door into the hall, a busty girl of around sixteen in tight jeans and a T-shirt; she was eating a handful of grapes and looking rather pleased with herself. \u0027Everyone meet Lexie,\u0027 said Miles proudly. \u0027Thank you for that, genius.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027re welcome,\u0027 said Lexie pertly, and she swept off upstairs. A heavy silence sank over the table. Without really knowing why, Samantha, Miles and Kay all glanced towards Mary, who looked as though she might be on the verge of tears. \u0027Coffee,\u0027 said Samantha, lurching to her feet. Mary disappeared into the bathroom. \u0027Let\u0027s go and sit through,\u0027 said Miles, conscious that the atmosphere was somewhat charged, but confident that he could, with a few jokes and his habitual bonhomie, steer everyone back into charity with each other. \u0027Bring your glasses.\u0027 His inner certainties had been no more rearranged by Kay\u0027s arguments than a breeze can move a boulder; yet his feeling towards her was not unkind, but rather pitying. He was the least intoxicated by the constant refilling of glasses, but on reaching the sitting room he realized how very full his bladder was. \u0027Whack on some music, Gav, and I\u0027ll go and get those choccies.\u0027 But Gavin made no move towards the vertical stacks of CDs in their sleek Perspex stands. He seemed to be waiting for Kay to start on him. Sure enough, as soon as Miles had vanished from sight, Kay said, \u0027Well, thank you very much, Gav. Thanks for all the support.\u0027 Gavin had drunk even more greedily than Kay throughout dinner, enjoying his own private celebration that he had not, after all, been offered up as a sacrifice to Samantha\u0027s gladiatorial bullying. He faced Kay squarely, full of a courage born not only of wine but because he had been treated for an hour as somebody important, knowledgeable and supportive, by Mary. \u0027You seemed to be doing OK on your own,\u0027 he said. Indeed, the little he had permitted himself to hear of Kay and Miles\u0027 argument had given him a pronounced sense of deja vu; if he had not had Mary to distract him, he might have fancied himself back on that famous evening, in the identical dining room, when Lisa had told Miles that he epitomized all that was wrong with society, and Miles had laughed in her face, and Lisa had lost her temper and refused to stay for coffee. It was not very long after, that Lisa had admitted that she was sleeping with an associate partner at her firm and advised Gavin to get tested for chlamydia. \u0027I don\u0027t know any of these people,\u0027 said Kay, \u0027and you haven\u0027t done one damn thing to make it any easier for me, have you?\u0027 \u0027What did you want me to do?\u0027 asked Gavin. He was wonderfully calm, insulated by the imminent returns of the Mollisons and Mary, and by the copious amounts of Chianti he had consumed. \u0027I didn\u0027t want an argument about the Fields. I don\u0027t give a monkey\u0027s about the Fields. Plus,\u0027 he added, \u0027it\u0027s a touchy subject around Mary; Barry was fighting on the council to keep the Fields part of Pagford.\u0027 \u0027Well, then, why couldn\u0027t you have told me - given me a hint?\u0027 He laughed, exactly as Miles had laughed at her. Before she could retort, the others returned like the Magi bearing gifts: Samantha carrying a tray of cups, followed by Mary holding the cafetiere, and Miles, with Kay\u0027s chocolates. Kay saw the flamboyant gold ribbon on the box and remembered how optimistic she had been about tonight when she had bought them. She turned her face away, trying to hide her anger, frantic with the desire to shout at Gavin, and also with a sudden, shocking urge to cry. \u0027It\u0027s been so nice,\u0027 she heard Mary say, in a thick voice that suggested she, too, might have been crying, \u0027but I won\u0027t stay for coffee, I don\u0027t want to be late back; Declan\u0027s a bit ... a bit unsettled at the moment. Thanks so much, Sam, Miles, it\u0027s been good to, you know ... well, get out for a bit.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ll walk you up the - \u0027 Miles began, but Gavin was talking firmly over him. \u0027You stay here, Miles; I\u0027ll see Mary back. I\u0027ll walk you up the road, Mary. It\u0027ll only take five minutes. It\u0027s dark up the top there.\u0027 Kay was barely breathing; all her being was concentrated in loathing of complacent Miles, tarty Samantha and fragile, drooping Mary, but most of all of Gavin himself. \u0027Oh, yes,\u0027 she heard herself saying, as everybody seemed to look towards her for permission, \u0027yep, you see Mary home, Gav.\u0027 She heard the front door close and Gavin had gone. Miles was pouring Kay\u0027s coffee. She watched the stream of hot black liquid fall, and felt suddenly, painfully alive to what she had risked in overthrowing her life for the man walking away into the night with another woman.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-casual-vacancy/page-14.html","bookId":2230,"book":{"id":2230,"title":"The Casual Vacancy","description":"Storyline: When Barry Fairbrother dies unexpectedly in his early forties, the little town of Pagford is left in shock.
