She could not forgive them for witnessing Gavin\u0027s parade of indifference, nor could she forget Miles\u0027 patronizing laughter, his attitude to Bellchapel, or the sneery way that he and Samantha had spoken about Krystal Weedon.\\n\\n In spite of Gavin\u0027s apology and his tepid assurances of affection, Kay could not stop picturing him nose to nose with Mary on the sofa; jumping up to help her with the plates; walking her home in the dark. When Gavin told her, a few days later, that he had had dinner at Mary\u0027s house, she had to fight down an angry response, because he had never eaten more than toast at her house in Hope Street.\\n\\n She might not be allowed to say anything bad about The Widow, about whom Gavin spoke as though she were the Holy Mother, but the Mollisons were different.\\n\\n \u0027I can\u0027t say I like Miles very much.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027He\u0027s not exactly my best mate.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027If you ask me, it\u0027ll be a catastrophe for the addiction clinic if he gets elected.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I doubt it\u0027ll make any difference.\u0027\\n\\n Gavin\u0027s apathy, his indifference to other people\u0027s pain, always infuriated Kay.\\n\\n \u0027Isn\u0027t there anyone who\u0027ll stick up for Bellchapel?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Colin Wall, I suppose,\u0027 said Gavin.\\n\\n So, at eight o\u0027clock on Monday evening, Kay walked up the Walls\u0027 drive and rang their doorbell. From the front step, she could make out Samantha Mollison\u0027s red Ford Fiesta, parked in the drive three houses along. The sight added a little extra zest to her desire for a fight.\\n\\n The Walls\u0027 door was opened by a short plain dumpy woman in a tie-dyed skirt.\\n\\n \u0027Hello,\u0027 said Kay. \u0027My name\u0027s Kay Bawden, and I was wondering whether I could speak to Colin Wall?\u0027\\n\\n For a split second, Tessa simply stared at the attractive young woman on the doorstep whom she had never seen before. The strangest idea flashed across her mind: that Colin was having an affair and that his lover had come to tell her so.\\n\\n \u0027Oh - yes - come in. I\u0027m Tessa.\u0027\\n\\n Kay wiped her feet conscientiously on the doormat and followed Tessa into a sitting room that was smaller, shabbier but cosier than the Mollisons\u0027. A tall, balding man with a high forehead was sitting in an armchair with a notebook in his lap and a pen in his hand.\\n\\n \u0027Colin, this is Kay Bawden,\u0027 said Tessa. \u0027She\u0027d like to speak to you.\u0027\\n\\n Tessa saw Colin\u0027s startled and wary expression, and knew at once that the woman was a stranger to him. Really, she thought, a little ashamed, what were you thinking?\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m sorry to barge in on you like this, unannounced,\u0027 said Kay, as Colin stood up to shake her hand. \u0027I would have telephoned, but you\u0027re - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027re ex-directory, yes,\u0027 said Colin. He towered over Kay, his eyes tiny behind the lenses of his glasses. \u0027Please, sit down.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Thank you. It\u0027s about the election,\u0027 said Kay. \u0027This Parish Council election. You\u0027re standing, aren\u0027t you, against Miles Mollison?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s right,\u0027 said Colin nervously. He knew who she must be: the reporter who had wanted to talk to Krystal. They had tracked him down - Tessa ought not to have let her in.\\n\\n \u0027I was wondering whether I could help in any way,\u0027 said Kay. \u0027I\u0027m a social worker, mostly working in the Fields. There are some facts and figures I could give you about the Bellchapel Addiction Clinic, which Mollison seems quite keen on closing. I\u0027ve been told that you\u0027re for the clinic? That you\u0027d like to keep it open?\u0027\\n\\n The onrush of relief and pleasure made him almost giddy.\\n\\n \u0027Oh, yes,\u0027 said Colin, \u0027yes, I would. Yes, that was my predecessor\u0027s - that\u0027s to say, the previous holder of the seat - Barry Fairbrother - was certainly opposed to closing the clinic. And I am, too.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, I\u0027ve had a conversation with Miles Mollison, and he made it quite clear that he doesn\u0027t think the clinic\u0027s worth keeping open. Frankly, I think he\u0027s rather ignorant and naive about the causes and treatment of addiction, and about the very real difference Bellchapel is making. If the Parish refuses to renew the lease on the building, and the District cuts funding, then there\u0027s a danger that some very vulnerable people will be left without support.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Yes, yes, I see,\u0027 said Colin. \u0027Oh, yes, I agree.\u0027\\n\\n He was astonished and flattered that this attractive young woman would have walked through the evening to find him and offer herself as an ally.\\n\\n \u0027Would you like a cup of tea or coffee, Kay?\u0027 asked Tessa.\\n\\n \u0027Oh, thanks very much,\u0027 said Kay. \u0027Tea, please, Tessa. No sugar.\u0027\\n\\n Fats was in the kitchen, helping himself from the fridge. He ate copiously and continually, but remained scrawny, never putting on an ounce of weight. In spite of his openly declared disgust for them, he seemed unaffected by Tessa\u0027s pack of ready-filled syringes, which sat in a clinical white box next to the cheese.\\n\\n Tessa moved to the kettle, and her thoughts returned to the subject that had consumed her ever since Sukhvinder had suggested it earlier: that Fats and Krystal were \u0027seeing each other\u0027. She had not questioned Fats, and she had not told Colin.\\n\\n The more that Tessa thought about it, the more certain she was that it could not be true. She was sure that Fats held himself in such high regard that no girl would be good enough, especially a girl like Krystal. Surely he would not ...\\n\\n Demean himself? Is that it? Is that what you think?\\n\\n \u0027Who\u0027s here?\u0027 Fats asked Tessa, through a mouthful of cold chicken, as she put on the kettle.\\n\\n \u0027A woman who wants to help Dad get elected to the council,\u0027 replied Tessa, foraging in the cupboard for biscuits.\\n\\n \u0027Why? Does she fancy him?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Grow up, Stu,\u0027 said Tessa crossly.\\n\\n He plucked several slices of thin ham out of an open pack and poked them, bit by bit, into his crammed mouth, like a magician inserting silk handkerchiefs into his fist. Fats sometimes stood for ten minutes at a time at the open fridge, ripping open clingfilm and packets and putting chunks of food directly into his mouth. It was a habit Colin deprecated, along with almost every other aspect of Fats\u0027 behaviour.\\n\\n \u0027Why\u0027s she want to help him, seriously?\u0027 he asked, having swallowed his mouthful of meat.\\n\\n \u0027She wants the Bellchapel Addiction Clinic to stay open.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What, a junkie, is she?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No, she isn\u0027t a junkie,\u0027 said Tessa, noting with annoyance that Fats had finished the last three chocolate biscuits and left the empty wrappings on the shelf. \u0027She\u0027s a social worker, and she thinks the clinic is doing a good job. Dad wants to keep it open, but Miles Mollison doesn\u0027t think it\u0027s very effective.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027It can\u0027t be doing that well. The Fields are full of glue-sniffers and smackheads.\u0027\\n\\n Tessa knew that if she had said that Colin wanted to close the clinic, Fats would have instantly produced an argument for its continuation.\\n\\n \u0027You ought to be a barrister, Stu,\u0027 she said as the kettle lid started to rattle.\\n\\n When Tessa returned to the sitting room with her tray, she found Kay talking Colin through a sheaf of printed material she had brought out of her big tote bag.\\n\\n \u0027... two drugs workers part-funded by the council, and partly by Action on Addiction, which is a really good charity. Then there\u0027s a social worker attached to the clinic, Nina, she\u0027s the one who gave me all this - oh, thanks very much,\u0027 said Kay, beaming up at Tessa, who had set down a mug of tea on the table beside her.\\n\\n Kay had taken to the Walls, in just a few minutes, as she had not taken to anybody else in Pagford. There had been no sweeping up-and-down glance from Tessa as she walked in, no gimlet-eyed assessment of her physical imperfections and dress sense. Her husband, though nervous, seemed decent and earnest in his determination to obstruct the abandonment of the Fields.\\n\\n \u0027Is that a London accent, Kay?\u0027 asked Tessa, dunking a plain biscuit in her tea. Kay nodded.\\n\\n \u0027What brings you to Pagford?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027A relationship,\u0027 said Kay. She took no pleasure saying it, even though she and Gavin were officially reconciled. She turned back to Colin.\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t quite understand the situation with regards to the Parish Council and the clinic.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, it owns the building,\u0027 said Colin. \u0027It\u0027s an old church. The lease is coming up for renewal.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027So that would be an easy way to force them out.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Exactly. When did you say you\u0027d spoken to Miles Mollison?\u0027 asked Colin, both hoping and dreading to hear that Miles had mentioned him.\\n\\n \u0027We had dinner, Friday before last,\u0027 Kay explained, \u0027Gavin and I - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, you\u0027re Gavin\u0027s girlfriend!\u0027 interjected Tessa.\\n\\n \u0027Yes; and, anyway, the subject of the Fields came up - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027It would,\u0027 said Tessa.\\n\\n \u0027 - and Miles mentioned Bellchapel, and I was quite - quite dismayed by the way he talked about the issues involved. I told him I\u0027m dealing with a family at the moment,\u0027 Kay remembered her indiscreet mention of the Weedons\u0027 names and proceeded carefully, \u0027and if the mother is deprived of methadone, she\u0027ll almost certainly end up back on the game.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027That sounds like the Weedons,\u0027 said Tessa, with a lowering sensation.\\n\\n \u0027I - yes, I am talking about the Weedons, actually,\u0027 said Kay.\\n\\n Tessa reached for another biscuit.\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027m Krystal\u0027s guidance teacher. This must be the second time her mother\u0027s been through Bellchapel, is it?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Third,\u0027 said Kay.\\n\\n \u0027We\u0027ve known Krystal since she was five: she was in our son\u0027s class at primary school,\u0027 Tessa said. \u0027She\u0027s had an awful life, really.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Absolutely,\u0027 said Kay. \u0027It\u0027s astounding she\u0027s as sweet as she is, actually.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Oh, I agree,\u0027 said Colin heartily.\\n\\n Remembering Colin\u0027s absolute refusal to rescind Krystal\u0027s detention after the squawking incident in assembly, Tessa raised her eyebrows. Then she wondered, with a sick lurch in her stomach, what Colin would say if Sukhvinder was not lying or mistaken. But surely Sukhvinder was wrong. She was a shy, naive girl. Probably she had got the wrong end of the stick ... misheard something ...\\n\\n \u0027The point is, about the only thing that motivates Terri is the fear of losing her kids,\u0027 said Kay. \u0027She\u0027s back on track at the moment; her key worker at the clinic told me she senses a bit of a breakthrough in Terri\u0027s attitude. If Bellchapel closes, it all goes belly-up again, and God knows what\u0027ll happen to the family.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027This is all very useful,\u0027 said Colin, nodding importantly, and starting to make notes on a clean page in his notebook. \u0027Very useful indeed. Did you say you\u0027ve got statistics on people going clean?\u0027\\n\\n Kay shuffled the printed pages, looking for the information. Tessa had the impression that Colin wanted to reclaim Kay\u0027s attention for himself. He had always been susceptible to good looks and a sympathetic manner.\\n\\n Tessa munched another biscuit, still thinking about Krystal. Their recent guidance sessions had not been very satisfactory. Krystal had been standoffish. Today\u0027s had been no different. She had extracted a promise from Krystal that she would not pursue or harass Sukhvinder Jawanda again, but Krystal\u0027s demeanour suggested that Tessa had let her down, that trust was broken. Possibly Colin\u0027s detention was to blame. Tessa had thought that she and Krystal had forged a bond strong enough to withstand that, although it had never been quite like the one Krystal had with Barry.\\n\\n (Tessa had been there, on the spot, the day that Barry had come into school with a rowing machine, looking for recruits to the crew he was trying to start. She had been summoned from the staff room to the gym, because the PE teacher was off sick, and the only supply teacher they could find at such short notice was male.\\n\\n The fourth-year girls, in their shorts and Aertex tops, had been giggly when they had arrived in the gym to find Miss Jarvis absent, replaced by two strange men. Tessa had had to reprimand Krystal, Nikki and Leanne, who had pushed to the front of the class and were making lewd suggestive remarks about the supply teacher; he was a handsome young man with an unfortunate tendency to blush.\\n\\n Barry, short, ginger-haired and bearded, was wearing a tracksuit. He had taken a morning off work to do this. Everybody thought his idea was strange and unrealistic: schools like Winterdown did not have rowing eights. Niamh and Siobhan had seemed half amused, half mortified by their dad\u0027s presence.\\n\\n Barry explained what he was trying to do: put together crews. He had secured the use of the old boathouse down on the canal at Yarvil; it was a fabulous sport, and an opportunity to shine, for themselves, for their school. Tessa had positioned herself right next to Krystal and her friends to keep them in check; the worst of their giggling had subsided, but was not entirely quelled.\\n\\n Barry demonstrated the rowing machine and asked for volunteers. Nobody stepped forward.\\n\\n \u0027Krystal Weedon,\u0027 said Barry, pointing at her. \u0027I\u0027ve seen you dangling off the monkey bars down the park; that\u0027s proper upper body strength you\u0027ve got there. Come here and give it a go.\u0027\\n\\n Krystal was only too happy to step into the spotlight; she swaggered up to the machine and sat down on it. Even with Tessa glowering beside them, Nikki and Leanne had howled with laughter and the rest of the class joined in.\\n\\n Barry showed Krystal what to do. The silent supply teacher had watched in professional alarm as Barry positioned her hands on the wooden handle.\\n\\n She heaved on the handle, making a stupid face at Nikki and Leanne, and everyone laughed again.\\n\\n \u0027Look at that,\u0027 Barry had said, beaming. \u0027She\u0027s a natural.\u0027\\n\\n Had Krystal really been a natural? Tessa did not know anything about rowing; she could not tell.\\n\\n \u0027Straighten your back,\u0027 Barry told Krystal, \u0027or you\u0027ll injure it. That\u0027s it. Pull ... pull ... look at that technique ... have you done this before?\u0027\\n\\n Then Krystal really had straightened her back, and she really had done it properly. She stopped looking at Nikki and Leanne. She hit a rhythm.\\n\\n \u0027Excellent,\u0027 said Barry. \u0027Look at that ... excellent. That\u0027s how you do it! Atta girl. And again. And again. And - \u0027\\n\\n \u0027It \u0027urts!\u0027 shouted Krystal.\\n\\n \u0027I know it does. That\u0027s how you end up with arms like Jennifer Aniston, doing that,\u0027 said Barry.\\n\\n There had been a little ripple of laughter, but this time they laughed with him. What was it that Barry had had? He was always so present, so natural, so entirely without self-consciousness. Teenagers, Tessa knew, were riven with the fear of ridicule. Those who were without it, and God knew there were few enough of them in the adult world, had natural authority among the young; they ought to be forced to teach.\\n\\n \u0027And rest!\u0027 Barry said, and Krystal slumped, red in the face and rubbing her arms.\\n\\n \u0027You\u0027ll have to give up the fags, Krystal,\u0027 said Barry, and he got a big laugh this time. \u0027OK, who else wants a try?\u0027\\n\\n When Krystal rejoined her watching classmates, she was no longer laughing. She watched each new rower jealously, her eyes darting constantly to Barry\u0027s bearded face to see what he thought of them. When Carmen Lewis messed it up completely, Barry said, \u0027Show \u0027em, Krystal,\u0027 and her face lit up as she returned to the machine.\\n\\n But at the end of the exhibition, when Barry asked those who were interested in trying out for the team to raise their hands, Krystal kept her arms folded. Tessa watched her shake her head, sneering, as Nikki muttered to her. Barry carefully noted down the names of the interested girls, then looked up.\\n\\n \u0027And you, Krystal Weedon,\u0027 he said, pointing at her. \u0027You\u0027re coming too. Don\u0027t you shake your head at me. I\u0027ll be very annoyed if I don\u0027t see you. That\u0027s natural talent you\u0027ve got there. I don\u0027t like seeing natural talent wasted. Krys - tal,\u0027 he said loudly, inscribing her name, \u0027Wee - don.\u0027\\n\\n Had Krystal thought about her natural talent as she showered at the end of the lesson? Had she carried the thought of her new aptitude around with her that day, like an unexpected Valentine? Tessa did not know; but to the amazement of all, except perhaps Barry, Krystal had turned up at try-outs.)\\n\\n Colin was nodding vigorously as Kay took him through relapse rates at Bellchapel.\\n\\n \u0027Parminder should see this,\u0027 he said. \u0027I\u0027ll make sure she gets a copy. Yes, yes, very useful indeed.\u0027\\n\\n Feeling slightly sick, Tessa took a fourth biscuit. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-casual-vacancy/page-26.html","bookId":2230,"book":{"id":2230,"title":"The Casual Vacancy","description":"Storyline: When Barry Fairbrother dies unexpectedly in his early forties, the little town of Pagford is left in shock.
