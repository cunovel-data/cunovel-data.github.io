{"id":107513,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"V Alison Jenkins, the journalist from the Yarvil and District Gazette, had at last established which of the many Weedon households in Yarvil housed Krystal. It had been difficult: nobody was registered to vote at the address and no landline number was listed for the property. Alison visited Foley Road in person on Sunday, but Krystal was out, and Terri, suspicious and antagonistic, refused to say when she would be back or confirm that she lived there. Krystal arrived home a mere twenty minutes after the journalist had departed in her car, and she and her mother had another row. \u0027Why din\u0027t ya tell her to wait? She was gonna interview me abou\u0027 the Fields an\u0027 stuff!\u0027 \u0027Interview you? Fuck off. Wha\u0027 the fuck for?\u0027 The argument escalated and Krystal walked out again, off to Nikki\u0027s, with Terri\u0027s mobile in her tracksuit bottoms. She frequently made off with this phone; many rows were triggered by her mother demanding it back and Krystal pretending that she didn\u0027t know where it was. Dimly, Krystal hoped that the journalist might know the number somehow and call her directly. She was in a crowded, jangling cafe in the shopping centre, telling Nikki and Leanne all about the journalist, when the mobile rang. \u0027\u0027Oo? Are you the journalist, like?\u0027 \u0027... o\u0027s \u0027at ... \u0027erri?\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s Krystal. \u0027Oo\u0027s this?\u0027 \u0027... \u0027m your ... \u0027nt ... other ... \u0027ister.\u0027 \u0027\u0027Oo?\u0027 shouted Krystal. One finger in the ear not pressed against the phone, she wove her way between the densely packed tables to reach a quieter place. \u0027Danielle,\u0027 said the woman, loud and clear on the other end of the telephone. \u0027I\u0027m yer mum\u0027s sister.\u0027 \u0027Oh, yeah,\u0027 said Krystal, disappointed. Fuckin\u0027 snobby bitch, Terri always said when Danielle\u0027s name came up. Krystal was not sure that she had ever met Danielle. \u0027It\u0027s abou\u0027 your Great Gran.\u0027 \u0027\u0027Oo?\u0027 \u0027Nana Cath,\u0027 said Danielle impatiently. Krystal reached the balcony overlooking the shopping centre forecourt; reception was strong here; she stopped. \u0027Wha\u0027s wrong with \u0027er?\u0027 said Krystal. It felt as though her stomach was flipping over, the way it had done as a little girl, turning somersaults on a railing like the one in front of her. Thirty feet below, the crowds surged, carrying plastic bags, pushing buggies and dragging toddlers. \u0027She\u0027s in South West General. She\u0027s been there a week. She\u0027s had a stroke.\u0027 \u0027She\u0027s bin there a week?\u0027 said Krystal, her stomach still swooping. \u0027Nobody told us.\u0027 \u0027Yeah, well, she can\u0027t speak prop\u0027ly, but she\u0027s said your name twice.\u0027 \u0027Mine?\u0027 asked Krystal, clutching the mobile tightly. \u0027Yeah. I think she\u0027d like to see yeh. It\u0027s serious. They\u0027re sayin\u0027 she migh\u0027 not recover.\u0027 \u0027Wha\u0027 ward is it?\u0027 asked Krystal, her mind buzzing. \u0027Twelve. High-dependency. Visiting hours are twelve till four, six till eight. All righ\u0027?\u0027 \u0027Is it - ?\u0027 \u0027I gotta go. I only wanted to let you know, in case you want to see her. \u0027Bye.\u0027 The line went dead. Krystal lowered the mobile from her ear, staring at the screen. She pressed a button repeatedly with her thumb, until she saw the word \u0027blocked\u0027. Her aunt had withheld her number. Krystal walked back to Nikki and Leanne. They knew at once that something was wrong. \u0027Go an\u0027 see \u0027er,\u0027 said Nikki, checking the time on her own mobile. \u0027Yeh\u0027ll ge\u0027 there fer two. Ge\u0027 the bus.\u0027 \u0027Yeah,\u0027 said Krystal blankly. She thought of fetching her mother, of taking her and Robbie to go and see Nana Cath too, but there had been a huge row a year before, and her mother and Nana Cath had had no contact since. Krystal was sure that Terri would take an immense amount of persuading to go to the hospital, and was not sure that Nana Cath would be happy to see her. It\u0027s serious. They\u0027re saying she might not recover. \u0027\u0027Ave yeh gor enough cash?\u0027 said Leanne, rummaging in her pockets as the three of them walked up the road towards the bus stop. \u0027Yeah,\u0027 said Krystal, checking. \u0027It\u0027s on\u0027y a quid up the hospital, innit?\u0027 They had time to share a cigarette before the number twenty-seven arrived. Nikki and Leanne waved her off as though she were going somewhere nice. At the very last moment, Krystal felt scared and wanted to shout \u0027Come with me!\u0027 But then the bus pulled away from the kerb, and Nikki and Leanne were already turning away, gossiping. The seat was prickly, covered in some old smelly fabric. The bus trundled onto the road that ran by the precinct and turned right into one of the main thoroughfares that led through all the big-name shops. Fear fluttered inside Krystal\u0027s belly like a foetus. She had known that Nana Cath was getting older and frailer, but somehow, vaguely, she had expected her to regenerate, to return to the heyday that had seemed to last so long; for her hair to turn black again, her spine to straighten and her memory to sharpen like her caustic tongue. She had never thought about Nana Cath dying, always associating her with toughness and invulnerability. If she had considered them at all, Krystal would have thought of the deformity to Nana Cath\u0027s chest, and the innumerable wrinkles criss-crossing her face, as honourable scars sustained during her successful battle to survive. Nobody close to Krystal had ever died of old age. (Death came to the young in her mother\u0027s circle, sometimes even before their faces and bodies had become emaciated and ravaged. The body that Krystal had found in the bathroom when she was six had been of a handsome young man, as white and lovely as a statue, or that was how she remembered him. But sometimes she found that memory confusing and doubted it. It was hard to know what to believe. She had often heard things as a child that adults later contradicted and denied. She could have sworn that Terri had said, \u0027It was yer dad.\u0027 But then, much later, she had said, \u0027Don\u0027 be so silly. Yer dad\u0027s not dead, \u0027e\u0027s in Bristol, innee?\u0027 So Krystal had had to try and reattach herself to the idea of Banger, which was what everybody called the man they said was her father. But always, in the background, there had been Nana Cath. She had escaped foster care because of Nana Cath, ready and waiting in Pagford, a strong if uncomfortable safety net. Swearing and furious, she had swooped, equally aggressive to Terri and to the social workers, and taken her equally angry great-granddaughter home. Krystal did not know whether she had loved or hated that little house in Hope Street. It was dingy and it smelt of bleach; it gave you a hemmed-in feeling. At the same time, it was safe, entirely safe. Nana Cath would only let approved individuals in through the door. There were old-fashioned bath cubes in a glass jar on the end of the bath.) What if there were other people at Nana Cath\u0027s bedside, when she got there? She would not recognize half her own family, and the idea that she might come across strangers tied to her by blood scared her. Terri had several half-sisters, products of her father\u0027s multiple liaisons, whom even Terri had never met; but Nana Cath tried to keep up with them all, doggedly maintaining contact with the large disconnected family her sons had produced. Occasionally, over the years, relatives Krystal did not recognize had turned up at Nana Cath\u0027s while she was there. Krystal thought that they eyed her askance and said things about her under their voices to Nana Cath; she pretended not to notice and waited for them to leave, so that she could have Nana Cath to herself again. She especially disliked the idea that there were any other children in Nana Cath\u0027s life. (\u0027\u0027Oo are they?\u0027 Krystal had asked Nana Cath when she was nine, pointing jealously at a framed photograph of two boys in Paxton High uniforms on Nana Cath\u0027s sideboard. \u0027Them\u0027s two o\u0027 my great-grandsons,\u0027 said Nana Cath. \u0027Tha\u0027s Dan and tha\u0027s Ricky. They\u0027re your cousins.\u0027 Krystal did not want them as cousins, and she did not want them on Nana Cath\u0027s sideboard. \u0027An\u0027 who\u0027s tha\u0027?\u0027 she demanded, pointing at a little girl with curly golden hair. \u0027Tha\u0027s my Michael\u0027s little girl, Rhiannon, when she were five. Beau\u0027iful, weren\u0027t she? Bu\u0027 she wen\u0027 an\u0027 married some wog,\u0027 said Nana Cath. There had never been a photograph of Robbie on Nana Cath\u0027s sideboard. Yeh don\u0027t even know who the father is, do yeh, yer whore? I\u0027m washin\u0027 my \u0027ands of yeh. I\u0027ve \u0027ad enough, Terri, I\u0027ve \u0027ad it: you can look after it yourself.) The bus trundled on through town, past all the Sunday afternoon shoppers. When Krystal had been small, Terri had taken her into the centre of Yarvil nearly every weekend, forcing her into a pushchair long past the age when Krystal needed it, because it was so much easier to hide nicked stuff with a pushchair, push it down under the kid\u0027s legs, hide it under the bags in the basket under the seat. Sometimes Terri would go on tandem shoplifting trips with the sister she spoke to, Cheryl, who was married to Shane Tully. Cheryl and Terri lived four streets away from each other in the Fields, and petrified the air with their language when they argued, which was frequently. Krystal never knew whether she and her Tully cousins were supposed to be on speaking terms or not, and no longer bothered keeping track, but she spoke to Dane whenever she ran across him. They had shagged, once, after splitting a bottle of cider out on the rec when they were fourteen. Neither of them had ever mentioned it afterwards. Krystal was hazy on whether or not it was legal, doing your cousin. Something Nikki had said had made her think that maybe it wasn\u0027t. The bus rolled up the road that led to the main entrance of South West General, and stopped twenty yards from an enormous long rectangular grey and glass building. There were patches of neat grass, a few small trees and a forest of signposts. Krystal followed two old ladies out of the bus and stood with her hands in her tracksuit pockets, looking around. She had already forgotten what kind of ward Danielle had told her Nana Cath was on; she recalled only the number twelve. She approached the nearest signpost with a casual air, squinting at it almost incidentally: it bore line upon line of impenetrable print, with words as long as Krystal\u0027s arm and arrows pointing left, right, diagonally. Krystal did not read well; being confronted with large quantities of words made her feel intimidated and aggressive. After several surreptitious glances at the arrows, she decided that there were no numbers there at all, so she followed the two old ladies towards the double glass doors at the front of the main building. The foyer was crowded and more confusing than the signposts. There was a bustling shop, which was separated from the main hall by floor to ceiling windows; there were rows of plastic chairs, which seemed to be full of people eating sandwiches; there was a packed cafe in the corner; and a kind of hexagonal counter in the middle of the floor, where women were answering enquiries as they checked their computers. Krystal headed there, her hands still in her pockets. \u0027Where\u0027s ward twelve?\u0027 Krystal asked one of the women in a surly voice. \u0027Third floor,\u0027 said the woman, matching her tone. Krystal did not want to ask anything else out of pride, so she turned and walked away, until she spotted lifts at the far end of the foyer and entered one going up. It took her nearly fifteen minutes to find the ward. Why didn\u0027t they put up numbers and arrows, not these stupid long words? But then, walking along a pale green corridor with her trainers squeaking on the linoleum floor, someone called her name. \u0027Krystal?\u0027 It was her aunt Cheryl, big and broad in a denim skirt and tight white vest, with banana-yellow black-rooted hair. She was tattooed from her knuckles to the tops of her thick arms, and wore multiple gold hoops like curtain rings in each ear. There was a can of Coke in her hand. \u0027She ain\u0027 bothered, then?\u0027 said Cheryl. Her bare legs were planted firmly apart, like a sentry guard. \u0027\u0027Oo?\u0027 \u0027Terri. She din\u0027 wanna come?\u0027 \u0027She don\u0027 know ye\u0027. I on\u0027y jus\u0027 \u0027eard. Danielle called an\u0027 tole me.\u0027 Cheryl ripped off the ring-pull and slurped Coke, her tiny eyes sunken in a wide, flat face that was mottled like corned beef, scrutinizing Krystal over the top of the can. \u0027I tole Danielle ter call yeh when it \u0027appened. Three days she were lyin\u0027 in the \u0027ouse, and no one fuckin\u0027 found \u0027er. The state of \u0027er. Fuckin\u0027 \u0027ell.\u0027 Krystal did not ask Cheryl why she herself had not walked the short distance to Foley Road to tell Terri the news. Evidently the sisters had fallen out again. It was impossible to keep up. \u0027Where is she?\u0027 asked Krystal. Cheryl led the way, her flip-flops making a slapping noise on the floor. \u0027Hey,\u0027 she said, as they walked. \u0027I \u0027ad a call fr\u0027m a journalist about you.\u0027 \u0027Didja?\u0027 \u0027She give me a number.\u0027 Krystal would have asked more questions, but they had entered a very quiet ward, and she was suddenly frightened. She did not like the smell. Nana Cath was almost unrecognizable. One side of her face was terribly twisted, as though the muscles had been pulled with a wire. Her mouth dragged to one side; even her eye seemed to droop. There were tubes taped to her, a needle in her arm. Lying down, the deformity in her chest was much more obvious. The sheet rose and fell in odd places, as if the grotesque head on its scrawny neck protruded from a barrel. When Krystal sat down beside her, Nana Cath made no movement. She simply gazed. One little hand trembled slightly. \u0027She ain\u0027 talkin\u0027, bu\u0027 she said yer name, twice, las\u0027 nigh\u0027,\u0027 Cheryl told her, staring gloomily over the rim of her can. There was a tightness in Krystal\u0027s chest. She did not know whether it would hurt Nana Cath to hold her hand. She edged her own fingers to within a few inches of Nana Cath\u0027s, but let them rest on the bedspread. \u0027Rhiannon\u0027s bin in,\u0027 said Cheryl. \u0027An\u0027 John an\u0027 Sue. Sue\u0027s tryin\u0027 ter get hold of Anne-Marie.\u0027 Krystal\u0027s spirits leapt. \u0027Where is she?\u0027 she asked Cheryl. \u0027Somewhere out Frenchay way. Y\u0027know she\u0027s got a baby now?\u0027 \u0027Yeah, I \u0027eard,\u0027 said Krystal. \u0027Wha\u0027 was it?\u0027 \u0027Dunno,\u0027 said Cheryl, swigging Coke. Someone at school had told her: Hey, Krystal, your sister\u0027s up the duff! She had been excited by the news. She was going to be an auntie, even if she never saw the baby. All her life, she had been in love with the idea of Anne-Marie, who had been taken away before Krystal was born; spirited into another dimension, like a fairy-tale character, as beautiful and mysterious as the dead man in Terri\u0027s bathroom. Nana Cath\u0027s lips moved. \u0027Wha\u0027?\u0027 said Krystal, bending low, half scared, half elated. \u0027D\u0027yeh wan\u0027 somethin\u0027, Nana Cath?\u0027 asked Cheryl, so loudly that whispering guests at other beds stared over. Krystal could hear a wheezing, rattling noise, but Nana Cath seemed to be making a definite attempt to form a word. Cheryl was leaning over the other side, one hand gripping the metal bars at the head of the bed. \u0027... Oh ... mm,\u0027 said Nana Cath. \u0027Wha\u0027?\u0027 said Krystal and Cheryl together. The eyes had moved millimetres: rheumy, filmy eyes, looking at Krystal\u0027s smooth young face, her open mouth, as she leaned over her great-grandmother, puzzled, eager and fearful. \u0027... owin ...\u0027 said the cracked old voice. \u0027She dunno wha\u0027 she\u0027s sayin\u0027,\u0027 Cheryl shouted over her shoulder at the timid couple visiting at the next bed. \u0027Three days lef\u0027 on the fuckin\u0027 floor, \u0027s\u0027not surprisin\u0027, is it?\u0027 But tears had blurred Krystal\u0027s eyes. The ward with its high windows dissolved into white light and shadow; she seemed to see a flash of bright sunlight on dark green water, fragmented into brilliant shards by the splashing rise and fall of oars. \u0027Yeah,\u0027 she whispered to Nana Cath. \u0027Yeah, I goes rowin\u0027, Nana.\u0027 But it was no longer true, because Mr Fairbrother was dead.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-casual-vacancy/page-12.html","bookId":2230,"book":{"id":2230,"title":"The Casual Vacancy","description":"Storyline: When Barry Fairbrother dies unexpectedly in his early forties, the little town of Pagford is left in shock.
