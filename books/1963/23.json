{"id":70123,"no":23,"title":"Page 23","content":"“Sure,” Robin answered, flipping her shoulder-length auburn hair away from her face. She’d had it tied back when she’d gone to bed, but it had pulled free during the night. Robin could well imagine how it looked now. Most mornings it tended to resemble foam on a newly poured mug of beer.\n “We’re friends, aren’t we, Blackie?” Jeff knelt, and without hesitation the dog came to him, eagerly licking his face.\n The man’s eyes revealed astonishment, however fleeting, and his dark brows drew together over his high-bridged nose. “Blackie,” he snapped. “Come.”\n The Labrador squeezed between two overgrown laurel bushes and returned to his master, who didn’t look any too pleased at his dog’s affection for Jeff.\n “My son has a way with animals,” Robin said.\n “Do you live here?” Jeff asked next. He seemed completely unaware of their new neighbor’s unfriendliness.\n “Next door.”\n “Oh, good.” Jeff grinned widely and placed his right hand on his chest. “I’m Jeff Masterson and this is my mom, Robin. We moved in yesterday.”\n “I’m Cole Camden. Welcome to the neighborhood.”\n Although his words were cordial, his tone wasn’t. Robin felt about as welcome as a punk-rock band at a retirees’ picnic.\n “I’m getting a dog myself,” Jeff went on affably. “That’s why we moved out of the apartment building—I couldn’t have a pet there except for my goldfish.”\n Cole nodded without comment.\n Oh, great, Robin thought. After years of scrimping and saving to buy a house, they were going to be stuck with an ill-tempered next-door neighbor. His house was older than the others on the block. Much bigger, too. Robin guessed that his home, a sprawling three-story structure, had been built in the early thirties. She knew that at one time this neighborhood had been filled with large opulent homes like Cole Camden’s. Gradually, over the years, the older places had been torn down and a series of two-story houses and trendy ramblers built in their place. Her neighbor’s house was the last vestige of an era long past.\n “Have you got any kids?” Jeff could hardly keep the eagerness out of his voice. In the apartment complex there’d always been plenty of playmates, and he was eager to make new friends, especially before he started classes in an unfamiliar school on Monday morning.\n Cole’s face hardened and Robin could have sworn the question had angered him. An uncomfortable moment passed before he answered. “No, I don’t have any kids.” His voice held a rough undertone, and for a split second Robin was sure she saw a flash of pain in his eyes.\n “Would it be okay if I played with Blackie sometimes? Just until I get my own dog?”\n “No.” Cole’s response was sharp, but, when Jeff flinched at his vehemence, Cole appeared to regret his harsh tone. “I don’t mean to be rude, but it’d probably be best if you stayed in your own yard.”\n “That’s all right,” Jeff said. “You can send Blackie over here to visit anytime you want. I like dogs.”\n “I can see that.” A hint of a smile lifted the corners of his mouth. Then his cool gaze moved from Jeff to Robin, his face again expressionless, but she sensed that he’d made up his mind about them, categorized them and come to his own conclusions.\n If Cole Camden thought he could intimidate her, Robin had news for him. He’d broadcast his message loud and clear. He didn’t want to be bothered by her or her son, and in exchange he’d stay out of her way. That was fine with her. Terrific, in fact. She didn’t have time for humoring grouches.\n Without another word, Cole turned and strode toward his house with Blackie at his heels.\n “Goodbye, Mr. Camden,” Jeff called, raising his hand.\n Robin wasn’t surprised when their neighbor didn’t give them the courtesy of a reply.\n In an effort to distract Jeff from Cole Camden’s unfriendliness, she said brightly, “Hey, I’m starving. How about you?”\n Jeff didn’t answer right away. “Do you think he’ll let me play with Blackie?”\n Robin sighed, considering the dilemma that faced her. She didn’t want Cole to hurt Jeff’s feelings, but it wasn’t likely their neighbor would appreciate her son’s affinity with his Labrador. By the same token, a neighbor’s dog, even one that belonged to a grouch, would ease her guilt over not being able to provide Jeff with the dog she’d promised him.\n “What do you think, Mom?” Jeff prompted. “He’ll probably let me play with Blackie sometimes, don’t you think?”\n “I don’t know, honey,” she whispered. “I just don’t know.”\n Later the same day, after buying groceries to stock their bare kitchen shelves and picking up other necessities, Robin counted the change at the bottom of her purse. She needed to be sure she had money for the subway on Monday morning. Luckily she had enough spare change for BART—Bay Area Rapid Transit—to last the week, but it was packed lunches for her and Jeff until her next payday, which was in two weeks.\n Her finances would’ve been in better shape if she’d waited another year to move out of the apartment. But interest rates were at a two-year low and she’d decided soon after the first of the year that if they were ever going to move out of the apartment this was the time.\n “Mom!” Jeff crashed through the back door, breathless. “We’re in trouble.”\n “Oh?” Robin glanced up from the salad she was mixing. A completely disgusted look on his face, her son flung himself into a chair and propped his elbows on the table. Then he let out a forceful sigh.\n “What’s wrong, Jeff?”\n “I’m afraid we made a bad mistake.”\n “How’s that?”\n “There’s nothing but girls in this neighborhood.” He made it sound as though they’d unexpectedly landed in enemy territory. “I rode my bike up and down the street and all I saw were girls.” He wrinkled his nose.\n “Don’t worry, you’ll be meeting lots of boys in school on Monday.”\n “You aren’t taking this seriously!” Jeff cried. “I don’t think you understand what this means. There are seven houses on this block. Six of them have kids and only one has a boy, and that’s me. I’m surrounded by women!”\n “How’d you find all this out?”\n “I asked, of course.” He sighed again. “What are you going to do about it, Mom?”\n “Me?” Robin asked. “Are you suggesting we move back to the apartment?”\n Jeff considered this for only a moment. “I’d think we should if it wasn’t for two things. We can’t have a dog there. And I found a fort.”\n “A fort?”\n “Yes,” he said solemnly. “It’s hidden way back in Mr. Camden’s yard and covered by a bunch of brush. It’s real neat there. I don’t think he knows about it, because the word on the street is he doesn’t like kids. Someone must’ve built it and I’m going to find out who. If there’s a club going, I want in. I’ve got the right—I live closer to Mr. Camden than anyone else does.”\n “Agreed.” Robin munched on a slice of green pepper and handed one to Jeff. “So you think it’d be all right if we stayed?”\n “I guess so,” Jeff conceded, “at least until I find out more about the fort.”\n Robin was about to say something else when the doorbell chimed.\n Jeff’s blue eyes met hers. “I bet it’s one of those pesky girls,” he said in disgust.\n “Do you want me to get rid of her?”\n Jeff nodded emphatically.\n Robin was smiling when she answered the front door. Jeff was right; it was a girl, one who seemed to be a couple of years younger than her son. She hadn’t come alone, though. Standing with the youngster was an adult.\n “Hi,” the woman said cheerfully, flashing Robin a warm smile. “I know you’ve hardly had a chance to get settled, but I wanted to introduce myself. I’m Heather Lawrence and this is my daughter, Kelly. We live next door, and we’d like to welcome you to the neighborhood.”\n Robin introduced herself as she opened the door and invited them in. Heather was cute and perky. Her hair was cut in a short bob that bounced when she spoke. Robin knew right away that she was going to like these neighbors. Heather’s warm reception was a pleasant change from the way Cole Camden had greeted her.\n “Would you like some coffee?” Robin asked.\n “If you’re sure I’m not interrupting anything.”\n “I’m sure.” Robin led her into the kitchen, where Jeff sat waiting. He cast her a look that suggested she should be shot for treason, then muttered something about forgetting that mothers were really girls in disguise. Then he headed out the front door.\n Robin reached for two matching ceramic mugs and poured coffee for herself and her new friend. She offered Kelly a glass of juice, then slid into a chair across the table from the girl and her mother. “I’m sorry about Jeff.” She felt obliged to apologize. “He’s at the age where he thinks girls are a plague to society.”\n “Don’t worry about it,” Heather said, smiling. “Kelly isn’t keen on boys herself.”\n “They’re creeps. I’d rather ride my bicycle than play with a boy,” the girl announced. “But Mom wanted me to come over with her so she didn’t look like a busybody. Right, Mom?”\n Heather blushed and threw her daughter a murderous glance.\n Robin laughed. “I thought it would take several weeks to get to know my neighbors and I’ve met two in one day.”\n “Someone else has already been over?”\n “Cole Camden introduced himself this morning,” she explained, keeping her eyes averted to hide the resentment she felt toward her unfriendly neighbor. Even now, hours later, she couldn’t help thinking about the way he’d reacted to her and Jeff.\n “Cole Camden introduced himself?” Heather repeated, sounding shocked. She frowned, staring into space as though digesting the fact.\n “To be honest, I think he would’ve preferred to avoid me, but his dog wanted to make friends with Jeff.”\n Heather’s mouth opened and closed twice. “Blackie did?”\n “Is there something strange about that?”\n “Frankly, yes. To say Cole keeps to himself is an understatement. I don’t think he’s said more than a handful of words to me in the entire two years since Kelly and I moved here. I don’t know why he stays in the neighborhood.” She paused to respond to her daughter, who was asking permission to go home. “Thank Robin for the juice, honey. Anyway,” she went on, turning back to Robin when her daughter had skipped out the door, “he’s all alone in that huge house and it’s ridiculous, really. Can you imagine what his heating bills must be? Although, personally, I don’t think money is much of a problem for him. But I’ve never heard any details.”\n It didn’t surprise Robin to learn Cole lived alone. She’d barely met the man, but guessed that life held little joy for him. It was as though love, warmth and friendship had all been found lacking and had therefore been systematically dismissed. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-mother-s-wish/page-23.html","bookId":1963,"book":{"id":1963,"title":"A Mother\u0027s Wish","description":"Storyline: \n Two stories from Debbie Macomber.
