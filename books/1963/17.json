He might be sitting behind that desk, but how do we know if what he says is true?” Meg rolled her eyes. “Who are you really, Steve Conlan?” Lindsey leaned forward, planting both hands on the edge of his desk. “I’m exactly who I appear to be. I’m thirty-eight years old. Unmarried. I own this shop and have ten full-time employees.” “Can you prove it?” “Of course.” A knock sounded on the door. “Come in,” Steve called. The man who’d greeted her when she first arrived stuck his head inside the door. He smiled apologetically. “Sorry to interrupt, but Sandy Janick’s on the phone.” Steve frowned. “Are we working on Sandy’s vehicle?” he wanted to know. “I don’t remember seeing a work order.” “No, she’s that friend your sister was trying to set you up with. Remember?” “Tell her I’ll call her back,” Steve said without hesitating. Meg bristled. He’d admitted that his sister had been playing matchmaker. So Nancy had set him up with another woman. Probably one without a troublesome teenager and a bunch of emotional garbage she was dragging around from a previous marriage. Meg tried to swallow the lump forming in her throat. “Gary,” Steve said, stopping the other man from leaving. “Would you kindly tell Lindsey who owns this shop?” “Sure,” the other man said with a grin. “Mostly the IRS.” “I’m serious,” Steve said impatiently. Gary chuckled. “Last I heard it was Walter Milton at Key Bank. Oops, there goes the phone again.” He was gone an instant later. “Walter Milton,” Lindsey said skeptically. “So you really don’t own this business.” “Walter Milton’s my banker and a good friend.” “So is Earl Markham, your parole officer,” Lindsey snapped. “A high school friend, correct?” She shook her head. “I’m afraid I can’t believe you, Mr. Conlan. If you were trying to get me to change my mind about you seeing my mother, it didn’t work.” Then turning to Meg, she said, “I wouldn’t trust him if I were you. He’s got a look about him ….” “What look?” Meg and Steve asked simultaneously. “You know—a criminal look. I’m sure I’ve seen his face before, and my guess is that it was in some post office.” Meg ground her teeth with frustration. “Lindsey, would you please stop being so difficult?” “I don’t think it’s a good idea for you to date a man who lies.” “You’re right,” Steve surprised them both by saying. “I should never have made up that ridiculous story about being a felon. I’ve learned my lesson and I won’t pull that stunt again. All I’m asking is that you give me a second chance to prove myself.” “I don’t think so.” Meg resisted throwing her arms in the air. “You know what really bothers me?” Lindsey went on. “That you’d involve my mother in this stupid scam of yours. That’s really low.” “I don’t blame you for being angry with me,” Steve said, before Meg could respond. “But don’t be upset with your mother—it was my idea, not hers.” “My mother wouldn’t stoop to anything that underhanded on her own.” Meg’s eyes met Steve’s and she wanted to weep with frustration. “I was hoping you’d find it in your heart to forgive me,” Steve said contritely, returning his attention to Lindsey. “I’d like us to be friends.” “Even if we were, that doesn’t mean I approve of you seeing my mother.” “Lindsey,” Meg began. “I—” “Mom, we can’t trust this guy,” Lindsey interrupted. “We know how willing he is to lie. And what about that phone call just now?” She pointed at Steve. “Another woman calls and he can hardly wait to get back to her. You saw the expression on his face.” “Don’t be ridiculous,” Steve snapped. “I’m crazy about your mother. I wouldn’t hurt her for the world.” “Yeah, whatever. That’s what they all say.” Lindsey had perfected the world-weary tone so beloved of teenagers everywhere. “I’ve had enough, Lindsey,” Meg said sternly. “I think you’d better go wait in the car.” Lindsey leapt eagerly out of her chair and rushed from the office, leaving Steve and Meg alone. “I’m sorry,” she whispered, standing. “I’ll try to talk to her again.” Steve walked around the desk and pulled her into his arms. “All she needs is a little time. Eventually she’ll learn to trust me.” He raised her hand to his mouth and kissed the knuckles. “But one thing’s for sure ….” “What’s that?” “I’m through with sneaking around meeting you. I’m taking you to dinner tonight and I’m coming to the front door. Lindsey will just have to accept that we’re dating. In fact, I’ll ask her if she’d like to join us.” “She won’t,” Meg said with certainty. “I’m still going to ask. She may not like me now, but in time I’ll win her heart, just the way I intend to win her mother’s.” What Steve didn’t seem to understand was that he’d already won hers. At seven that night, Meg was humming softly to herself and dabbing perfume on her wrists. Steve was due any minute. The telephone rang, but Meg didn’t bother to answer. There was no point. The call was almost guaranteed to be for Lindsey. She heard the girl racing at breakneck speed for the phone, as if reaching it before the second ring was some kind of personal goal. “Mom!” Lindsey screeched from the kitchen downstairs, reaching her in the master bath. “I’ll be right there,” she called back, checking her reflection in the bathroom mirror one last time. Lindsey yelled something else that Meg couldn’t hear. “Who is it?” Meg asked, coming out of her bedroom and hurrying downstairs. “I already told you it’s Steve,” Lindsey said indifferently as she passed her leaving the kitchen. Meg glanced at her watch and reached for the phone. “Hello.” “Hi,” he said, sounding discouraged. “I ran into a problem and it looks like I’m going to be late.” “What kind of problem?” It was already later than her normal dinnertime, and Meg was hungry. “I’m not sure yet. Sandy Janick phoned and apparently she’s got a flat tire ….” “Listen,” Meg said with feigned cheerfulness, “why don’t we cancel dinner for this evening? It sounds like you’ve got your hands full.” “Yes, but … “ “I’m hungry right now. It’s no big deal—we’ll have dinner another night.” Steve hesitated. “You’re sure?” “Positive.” She was trembling so badly it was difficult to remain standing. Steve and Sandy. She suspected Nancy had arranged the flat tire, but if Steve couldn’t see through that, then it was obvious he didn’t want to. “It’s not a problem,” Meg insisted. “I’ll give you a call tomorrow.” “Sure …. That would be great.” She barely heard the rest of the conversation. He kept talking and Meg hoped she made the appropriate responses. She must have, because a couple of minutes later he hung up. Closing her eyes, Meg exhaled and replaced the receiver. “Mom?” Meg turned to face her daughter. “Is everything okay?” She nodded, unable to chase away the burning pain that attacked the pit of her stomach and radiated out. “Then how come you’re so pale?” “I’m fine, honey. Steve and I won’t be going out to dinner after all.” She tried to sound as if nothing was amiss, but her entire world seemed to be collapsing around her. “Why don’t we get a pizza? Do you want to call? Order whatever you want. Okay?” She was overreacting and knew it. If Steve was doing something underhanded, he wouldn’t tell her he was meeting Sandy Janick. He’d do the same things Dave had done. He’d lie and cheat. “I’m going to change my clothes,” Meg said, heading blindly for the stairs. She half expected Lindsey to follow her and announce that she’d been right all along, that Steve wasn’t to be trusted. But to Meg’s astonishment, her daughter said nothing. “I knew if anyone could help Sandy with her flat tire it would be you,” Nancy said, smiling benevolently at her older brother. Steve glanced at his watch, frustrated and angry with his sister—and himself. She’d done it again. She’d manipulated him into doing something he didn’t want to do. Instead of spending the evening with Meg, he’d been trapped into helping these two out of a fix. Leave it to his sister. Not only had Nancy and Sandy managed to get a flat, but they’d been on the Mercer Island floating bridge in the middle of rush-hour traffic. Steve had to arrange for a tow truck and then meet them at his shop. From there, they’d all ended up back at the house, and Sandy had made it clear that she was looking for a little male companionship. There was a time Steve would’ve jumped at the chance to console the attractive widow. But no longer. “I can’t tell you how much I appreciate your help,” Sandy told him now. “Thank you so much.” “You’re welcome.” He looked pointedly at his watch. It was just after nine, still early enough to steal away and visit Meg. Lindsey would disapprove, but that couldn’t be avoided. The girl was proving to be more of a problem than Steve had expected. She was downright stubborn and unwilling to give him the slightest bit of credit. Well, she was dealing with a pro, and Steve wasn’t about to give up on either of the Remington women. Not without a fight. “You’re leaving?” Nancy asked as Steve marched to the front door. “Yes,” he said. “Is that a problem?” “I guess not.” His sister wore a downtrodden look, as if he’d disappointed her. “I have to be going, too,” Sandy Janick said. “Again, thank you.” Steve walked her to the door and said a polite goodbye, hoping it really was goodbye. He wished her well, but wasn’t interested in becoming her knight in shining armor. Not when there was another damsel whose interest he coveted. He closed the door as he went to retrieve his car keys from the hall table and grab his jacket. Nancy got up and followed him as he prepared to leave. “Where are you going?” she asked. Steve glared at his sister. “What makes you think it’s any of your business?” “Because I have a feeling that you’re off to see that … that floozy.”","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-mother-s-wish/page-17.html","bookId":1963,"book":{"id":1963,"title":"A Mother\u0027s Wish","description":"Storyline: Two stories from Debbie Macomber.
