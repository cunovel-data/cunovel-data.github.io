{"id":70124,"no":24,"title":"Page 24","content":"“Apparently, he was married once, but he was divorced long before I came here.”\\n\\n Robin had dealt with unfriendly men before, but something about Cole struck her hard and deep, and she wasn’t sure what it was or why he evoked such a strong feeling within her.\\n\\n “He and his dog are inseparable,” Heather added.\\n\\n Robin nodded, hardly listening. He’d intimidated her at first, but when she’d pulled herself together and faced him squarely he’d loosened up a bit and, later, even seemed amused. But then Jeff had asked him about children, and Robin had seen the pain in his eyes.\\n\\n As if by magic, her son’s face appeared around the door. When he saw that Kelly was gone, he walked into the room, hands in his back pockets.\\n\\n “Do you have a dog?” he asked Heather.\\n\\n “Unfortunately, no. Kelly’s allergic.”\\n\\n Jeff nodded as though to say that was exactly the kind of thing he expected from a girl. “We’re getting a German shepherd soon, aren’t we, Mom?”\\n\\n “Soon,” Robin responded, feeling wretched. After Heather left, she was going to tell Jeff the truth. She fully intended to let him have his dog, but he’d have to wait a while. She’d been practicing what to say. She’d even come up with a compromise. They could get a cat. Cats didn’t seem to mind being left on their own, and they didn’t need to be walked. Although she wasn’t happy about keeping a litter box in the house, Robin was willing to put up with that inconvenience. Then, when she could afford to have a fence built, they’d get a dog. She planned to be positive and direct with Jeff. He’d understand. At least she hoped he would.\\n\\n Heather stayed only a few more minutes. The visit had been a fruitful one. Robin had learned that Heather was divorced, worked mornings in an office and provided after-school day care in an effort to spend more time with Kelly. This information was good news to Robin, and the two women agreed that Jeff would go to the Lawrence house before and after school, instead of the community center several blocks away. The arrangement suited them both; even Jeff shrugged in agreement.\\n\\n Robin would’ve liked to ask her new friend more about Cole, but his name didn’t come up again, and she didn’t want to seem too curious about him.\\n\\n After Heather left, Robin braced herself for the talk with Jeff about getting a dog. Unfortunately, it didn’t go well. It seemed that after waiting nearly ten years, a few more months was completely unacceptable.\\n\\n “You promised!” he shouted. “You said I could have a dog when we moved into the house!”\\n\\n “You can, sweetheart, but not right away.”\\n\\n Unusual for Jeff, tears gathered in his eyes, and he struggled to hold them back. Soon Robin felt moisture filling her own eyes. She hated disappointing Jeff more than anything. His heart was set on getting a dog right away, and he considered the offer of a cat a poor substitute.\\n\\n He left the house soon afterward. In an effort to soothe his hurt feelings, Robin cooked her son’s favorite meal—macaroni and cheese with sliced sausage and lots of ketchup.\\n\\n She didn’t see him on the pavement or the street when she went to check half an hour later. She stood on the porch, wondering where he’d gone. His bike was inside the garage, and he’d already aired his views about playing with any of the girls in the neighborhood.\\n\\n It would be just like him to storm into his room in a fit of indignation and promptly fall asleep. Robin hurried upstairs to his bedroom, which was across the hall from her own.\\n\\n His bed was made and his clothes hung neatly in the closet. Robin decided that in another day or two, everything would be back to normal.\\n\\n It wasn’t until she turned to leave that she saw the note on his desk. Picking it up, Robin read the first line and felt a swirling sense of panic.\\n\\n Dear Mom,\\n\\n You broke your promise. You said I could have a dog and now you say I have to wait. If I can’t have a dog, then I don’t want to live with you anymore. This is goodbye forever.\\n\\n Love, Jeff\\n\\n Two\\n\\n For a moment, Robin was too stunned to react. Her heart was pounding so hard it echoed in her ears like thunder, so loud it seemed to knock her off balance.\\n\\n Rushing down the stairs, she stood on the porch, cupped her hands over her mouth and screamed frantically. “Jeff! Jeffy!”\\n\\n Cole Camden was standing on his front porch, too. He released a shrill whistle and stood waiting expectantly. When nothing happened, he called, “Blackie!”\\n\\n “Jeff!” Robin tried again.\\n\\n “Blackie!”\\n\\n Robin called for Jeff once more, but her voice cracked as the panic engulfed her. She paused, placed her hand over her mouth and closed her eyes, trying to regain her composure.\\n\\n “Blackie!” Cole yelled. He looked furious about his dog’s disappearance.\\n\\n It took Robin only a moment to put two and two together. “Cole,” she cried, running across the lawn toward him. “I think Jeff and Blackie might have run away together.”\\n\\n Cole looked at her as if she was deranged, and Robin couldn’t blame him. “Jeff left me a note. He wants a dog so badly and we can’t get one right now because … well, because we can’t, and I had to tell him, and he was terribly disappointed and he decided to run away.”\\n\\n Cole’s mouth thinned. “The whole idea is ridiculous. Even if Jeff did run away, Blackie would never go with him.”\\n\\n “Do you honestly think I’d make this up?” she shrieked. “The last time I saw Jeff was around four-thirty, and I’d bet cold cash that’s about the same time Blackie disappeared.”\\n\\n Cole’s gaze narrowed. “Then where are they?”\\n\\n “If I knew that, do you think I’d be standing around here arguing with you?”\\n\\n “Listen, lady, I don’t know your son, but I know my dog and—”\\n\\n “My name’s not lady,” Robin flared, clenching her hands at her sides. He was looking at her as though she were a madwoman on the loose—which she was where her son was concerned. “I’m sorry to have troubled you. When I find Jeff, I’ll make sure your dog gets home.”\\n\\n Cole’s eyes shot sparks in her direction, but she ignored them. Turning abruptly, she ran back to her own house. Halfway there, she stopped dead and whirled around to face Cole again. “The fort.”\\n\\n “What fort?” Cole demanded.\\n\\n “The one that’s in the back of your yard. It’s covered with brush …. Jeff found it earlier today. He wouldn’t know anywhere else to go and that would be the perfect hiding place.”\\n\\n “No one’s been there in years,” Cole said, discounting her suggestion.\\n\\n “The least we can do is look.”\\n\\n Cole’s nod was reluctant. He led the way to his backyard, which was much larger than hers. There was a small grove of oak trees at the rear of the property and beyond that a high fence. Apparently the fort was situated between the trees and the fence. A few minutes later, in the most remote corner of the yard, nestled between two trees, Robin saw the small wooden structure. It blended into the terrain, and if she hadn’t been looking for the hideaway, she would never have seen it.\\n\\n It was obvious when they neared the space that someone had taken up residence. Cole lowered himself down to all fours, peered inside, then looked back at Robin with a nod. He breathed in sharply, apparently irritated by this turn of events, and crawled through the narrow entrance.\\n\\n Not about to be left standing by herself, Robin got down on her knees and followed him in.\\n\\n Just as she’d suspected, Jeff and Blackie were huddled together in a corner. Jeff was fast asleep and Blackie was curled up by his side, guarding him. When Cole and Robin entered, the Labrador lifted his head and wagged his tail in greeting.\\n\\n The fort wasn’t much bigger than the tent Jeff had constructed the night before, and Robin was forced to pull her knees close and loop her arms around them. Cole’s larger body seemed to fill every available bit of space.\\n\\n Jeff must have sensed that his newfound home had been invaded because his eyes fluttered open and he gazed at Robin, then turned his head to stare at Cole.\\n\\n “Hi, Mom,” he said sheepishly. “I bet I’m in trouble, aren’t I?”\\n\\n Robin was so grateful to find him that all she could do was nod. If she’d tried to speak, her voice would’ve been shaking with emotion, which would only have embarrassed them both.\\n\\n “So, Jeff,” Cole said sternly. “You were going to run away from home. I see you brought everything you needed.” He pushed the frying pan and atlas into the middle of their cramped quarters. “What I want to know is how you convinced Blackie to join you.”\\n\\n “He came on his own,” Jeff murmured, but his eyes avoided Cole’s. “I wouldn’t have taken him on purpose—he’s your dog.”\\n\\n “I’m glad you didn’t … coerce him.”\\n\\n “All you took was a frying pan and an atlas!” Robin cried, staring at the cast-iron skillet and the atlas with its dog-eared pages.\\n\\n Cole and Jeff both ignored her outburst.\\n\\n “I take it you don’t like living here?” Cole asked.\\n\\n Jeff stiffened, then shook his head vigorously. “Mom told me that when we moved I could have a dog and now I can’t. And … and she dragged me into a neighborhood filled with girls. That might’ve been okay if I had a dog, but then she broke her promise. A promise is a promise and it’s sacred. A guy would never do that.”\\n\\n “So you can’t have a dog until later?”\\n\\n “All because of a stupid fence.”\\n\\n Cole nodded. “Fences are important, you know. And you know what else? Your mom was worried about you.”\\n\\n Jeff looked at Robin, who was blinking furiously to keep the tears from dripping down her face. The upheaval and stress of the move had drained her emotionally and she was an unmitigated mess. Normally, she was a calm, controlled person, but this whole drama with Jeff was her undoing. That and the fact she’d hardly slept the night before in his makeshift tent.\\n\\n “Mom,” Jeff said, studying her anxiously, “are you all right?”\\n\\n She covered her face with both hands. “I slept with a dog and you ran away and all you took was a frying pan and an atlas.” That made no sense whatsoever, but she couldn’t help it, and once the tears started they wouldn’t stop.\\n\\n “I’m sorry, Mom,” Jeff said softly. “I didn’t mean to make you cry.”\\n\\n “I know,” she whimpered. “I want you to have a dog, I really do, but we can’t keep one locked up in the house all day and we don’t have a fence and … and the way you just looked at me, I swear it was Lenny all over again.”\\n\\n “Who’s Lenny?” Cole cocked his head toward Jeff, speaking in a whisper.\\n\\n “Lenny was my dad. He died when I was real little. I don’t even remember him.”\\n\\n Cole shared a knowing look with her son. “It might be a good idea if we got your mother back inside the house.”\\n\\n “You think I’m getting hysterical, don’t you?” Robin burst out. “I want you both to know I’m in perfect control. A woman can cry every now and then if she wants. Venting your emotions is healthy—all the books say so.” \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/a-mother-s-wish/page-24.html","bookId":1963,"book":{"id":1963,"title":"A Mother\u0027s Wish","description":"Storyline: Two stories from Debbie Macomber.
