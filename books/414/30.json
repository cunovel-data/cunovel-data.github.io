{"id":44059,"no":30,"title":"XXX DIGNITY AND IMPUDENCE","content":"I knew Ned Ferry was having that inner strife with which we ought always to credit even Gholson\u0027s sort, and I had a loving ambition to help him \"take the upper fork.\" So doing, I might help Charlotte Oliver fulfil the same principle, win the same victory. When, therefore, Gholson put the question to me squarely, Would I speak to Ferry? I consented, and as the four of us, horsemen, left our beasts in the stable munching corn, Gholson began a surprisingly animated talk with our host, and Ferry, with a quizzical smile, said to me \"Talk with you?--shall be happy to; we\u0027ll just make a slight détour on this side the grove and woods-pasture, eh?\" He meant the north side, opposite that one by which we had come from church. Here the landscape was much the same as there; wide fields on each side the fenced highway that still ran north and south, and woods for the sky-line everywhere. We chose an easy footpath along the northern fence of the grove, crossed the highway, and passed on a few steps alongside the woods-pasture fence. We talked as we went, he giving the kindest heed to my every word though I could see that, like any good soldier, he was scanning all the ground for its fighting values, and, not to be outdone, I, myself, pointed out, a short way up the public road, a fence-gap on the left, made by our camping soldiers two nights before. It was at another such gap, in the woods-pasture fence, that we turned back by a path through it which led into the wood and so again toward the highway and the house-grove. The evening General Austin sent me to Wiggins it was at this gap that I saw old Dismukes sitting cross-legged on the ground, playing poker; and here, now, I summoned the desperation to speak directly to my point. I had already tried hard to get something said, but had found myself at every turn entangled in generalities. Now, stammering and gagging I remarked that our experiences of the morning, both in church and out, had in some way combined with an earlier word of his own to me, and given me a valuable thought. \"You remember, when I wanted to shoot that Yankee off my horse?\" \"Yes; and I said--what?\" \"You said \u0027This isn\u0027t your private war.\u0027 Lieutenant, I hope those words may last in my memory forever and come to me in every moral situation in which I may find myself.\" \"Yes? Well, I think that\u0027s good.\" \"It seems to me, Lieutenant Ferry, that in every problem of moral conduct we confront we really hold in trust an interest of all mankind. To solve that problem bravely and faithfully is to make life just so much easier for everybody; and to fail to do so is to make it just so much harder to solve by whoever has next to face it.\" Whurroo! my blood was up now, let him look to himself! \"Yes?\" said Ferry, picking at the underbrush as we sauntered, and for some time he said no more. Then he asked, \"You want me to apply that to myself, in--in the present case?\" and to my tender amazement, while his eyes seemed to count his slackening steps, he laid his arm across my shoulders. An hour of avowal could not have told me more; could not have filled me half so full of sympathy, admiration and love, as did that one slight motion. It befitted the day, a day outwardly so quiescent, yet in which so much was going on. A realization of this quiet activity kept us silent until we had come through the woods-pasture to its southern border, and so through the big white field-gate into the public road; now we turned up toward the grove-gate, and here I spoke again. \"Do you still think we ought to wait here for the command?\" That from a private soldier to his captain! Yet all my leader answered was \"You think there\u0027s cause to change our mind?\" \"I don\u0027t know, Lieutenant; do you think Jewett has run back into his own lines?\" \"Yes, I think so; and you?\" \"Why, eh,--Lieutenant, I don\u0027t believe there\u0027s a braver man in Grant\u0027s army than that one a-straddle of my horse to-day! Why, just the way he got him, night before last,--you\u0027ve heard that, haven\u0027t you?\" \"Yes, the General told me. And so you think--\" \"Lieutenant, I can\u0027t help believing he\u0027s out here to make a new record for himself, at whatever cost!\" We went on some steps in silence and entered the gate of the house-grove; and just as Ferry would have replied we discovered before us in the mottled shade of the driveway, with her arm on Cécile\u0027s shoulders as his lay on mine, and with her eyes counting her slackening steps, Charlotte Oliver. They must have espied us already out in the highway, for they also were turned toward the house, and as we neared them Charlotte faced round with a cheery absence of surprise and said \"Mr. Smith, don\u0027t we owe each other a better acquaintance? Suppose we settle up.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2561/70546.html","bookId":414,"book":{"id":414,"title":"The Cavalier","description":"简介： Our camp was in the heart of Copiah County, Mississippi, a mile or so west of Gallatin and about six miles east of that once robber-haunted road, the Natchez Trace.
