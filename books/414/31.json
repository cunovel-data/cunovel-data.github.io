{"id":44060,"no":31,"title":"XXXI THE RED STAR\u0027S WARNING","content":"It seemed quite as undeniable, as we stood there, that Ned Ferry owed Cécile a better acquaintance. Every new hour enhanced her graces, and were I, here, less engrossed with her companion, I could pitch the praises of Cécile upon almost as high and brilliant a key--there may be room for that yet. Ferry moved on at her side. Charlotte stayed a moment to laugh at a squirrel, and then turned to walk, saying with eyes on the earth-- \n \n \"If I tell you something, will you never tell?\" \n \n I looked down too. \"Suppose I should feel sure it ought to be told.\" \n \n \"If you wait till you do you may tell it; that will suit me well enough.\" \n \n \"I will always suit you the best I can.\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t know why you should,\" she said. \n \n \"You risked your life to save mine; and you risked it when I did not deserve so much as your respect.\" \n \n \"Oh!--we must never talk about that again, Richard; you saw me in the evilest guise I ever wore, and that is saying much.\" \n \n \"But,\" I responded, \"you put it on for a better reason than you could tell me then or can tell me now, though now I know your story.\" \n \n \"Please don\u0027t forget,\" she murmured, \"that you know too much.\" \"No, no! I don\u0027t know half enough; I know only what Miss Camilla and--and--Gholson could tell me,\" was my tricky reply, and I tried to look straight into her eyes, but they took that faint introspective contraction of which I have spoken, and gazed through me like sunlight through glass. Then again she bent her glance upon her steps, saying-- \n \n \"Ah, Richard, you have found out all you could, and I am glad of it, except of what I, myself, have had to betray to you; for that was more than one would want to tell her twin brother. But I had to create you my scout, and I had only two or three hours for my whole work of creation.\" \n \n \"Well, you completed it.\" We went on some steps, and then she said-- \n \n \"You tell me I risked my life to save yours; I risked more than life, and I risked it for more than to save yours. Yet I did not save your life; you saved it, yourself, and--\" here her low tone thrilled like a harp-string--\"you risked it--frightfully--at that bridge--merely to save the promise you made me that you need not have made at all--oh, you needn\u0027t shake your head; I know.\" \n \n \"Ah, how you gild my base metal!\" \n \n \"No, no, I have the story exactly, and from one who has no mind to praise you.\" \n \n \"From Gholson?\" \n \n \"Gholson! no! I have it from Lucius Oliver, who had it from his son. He told me carefully, quietly and entirely, in pure spleen, so that I might know that they know--think they know, that is,--why you and--he in front of us yonder--would not shoot his son when--\" \n \n \"When as soldiers it was our simple du\u0027--\" \n \n \"Yes; and also that I may understand that he--the son--has sworn by that right hand you mutilated that the \u0027pair of you\u0027 shall die before he does.\" \n \n \"I ought not to have shown him that envelope addressed to you.\" \n \n \"Ah, but if it saved your life!\" \n \n \"And this is what you don\u0027t want me to tell? Ah, I see; for me to know it is enough; I can put it to him as a theory. I can say Oliver is not a man to be put upon the defensive, and that he is more than likely to be hunting \u0027the pair of us\u0027--\" All at once I thought of something. \n \n \"What made you give that sudden start?\" she asked as we faced about in the driveway to make our walk a moment longer; \"that\u0027s a bad habit you\u0027ve got; why do you do it?\" \n \n I fancied the thrilling freshness of the question I was about to put would be explanation enough. \"Do you believe Jewett has gone back into his own lines?\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t know; hasn\u0027t he?\" \n \n \"Oh, I don\u0027t know, either, but--well, I don\u0027t believe there\u0027s a braver man in Grant\u0027s army than that one a-straddle of my horse to-day! Why, just the way he got him, night before last,--you\u0027ve heard that, have you not?\" \n \n \"Yes, I\u0027ve heard it; he is a very daring man; what of it?\" \n \n \"Why, I can\u0027t help thinking he\u0027s out here to make a new record for himself, at whatever cost!\" \n \n A note of distress hung on my hearer\u0027s stifled voice; her head went lower and she laid her fingers pensively to her lips. \"It would be like him,\" I heard her murmur, and when I asked if she meant Jewett she shook her head. \n \n \"No,\" I said, \"you mean it would be like Oliver to join him,\" and with that the sudden start was hers. \"He wouldn\u0027t have to touch Ned Ferry or me,\" I went on, heartlessly, \"nor to come near us, to make us rue the hour we let ourselves forget this wasn\u0027t our private war.\" \n \n She whispered something to herself in horrified dismay; but then she looked at me with her eyes very blue and said \"You\u0027ll see him about it, won\u0027t you? You must help unravel this tangle, Richard; and if you do I\u0027ll--I\u0027ll dance at your wedding; yours and--somebody\u0027s we know!\" Her eyes began forewith. \n \n A light footfall sounded behind us, and Camille gave both her hands to my companion. \"I was in the hall,\" she said, \"telling Cécile she was like a white star that had come out by day, when I saw you here looking like a great red one; and you\u0027re still more like a red, red rose, and I\u0027ve come to get some of your fragrance.\" \n \n \"I\u0027d exchange for yours any day, and thank you, dear,\" responded Charlotte; \"you\u0027re a bunch of sweet-peas. Isn\u0027t she, Mr. Smith?\" \n \n The bunch beamed an ecstatic bliss. What was the explanation; had her father arrived, or--or somebody else? The question went through me like an arrow. Was the cause of this heavenly radiance somebody else?--that was the barb; or was it I?--that was the soothing feather. \n \n In gratitude for Charlotte\u0027s word she sank backward in a long obeisance. \"May it please your ladyship, dinner is served. Oh, Mr. Smith, I\u0027ve been listening to Mr. Gholson talking with aunt Martha and Estelle; I don\u0027t wonder you and he are friends; I think his ideas of religion are perfectly beautiful!\" \n \n At our two-o\u0027clock dinner I found that our company had been reinforced. On one side of Camille sat I; but on the other side sat \"Harry.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2561/70547.html","bookId":414,"book":{"id":414,"title":"The Cavalier","description":"简介： Our camp was in the heart of Copiah County, Mississippi, a mile or so west of Gallatin and about six miles east of that once robber-haunted road, the Natchez Trace.
