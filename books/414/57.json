{"id":44086,"no":57,"title":"LVII A YES AND A NO","content":"But now Charlotte\u0027s recovery took on new speed. Maybe her new brightness meant only that her heart was learning to bear its load; but we hoped that was just what it was unlearning, as she and Ferry sat at chess on the gallery in the afternoons. \\n\\n \\n\\n One night the fellows gave a dance in Brookhaven. We went in two wagons and by the light of mounted torch-bearers, and Charlotte and Ferry stood at the dooryard gate and sent after us their mirthful warnings and good-byes. It set some of us a-hoping--to see them there--a dooryard gate means so much. We fairly prayed he might compel her decision before she should turn to re-enter the house. But the following morning it was evident we had prayed in vain. \\n\\n \\n\\n On the next afternoon but one we heard that a great column of our soldiers was approaching on the nearest highway, bound up the railroad to Joe Johnston\u0027s army from the region about Port Hudson, and Charlotte instantly proposed that our ladies deal out food and drink from some shady spot on the roadside. It was one of those southern summer days when it verily seems hotter in the shade than in the sun--unless you are in the sun. The force was wholly artillery and infantry, the last Confederate infantry that region ever saw in column under arms; poor, limping, brown-faced, bloody-footed boys! their weapons were the only clean things, the only whole things, about them except their unbroken spirit; and when the very foremost command chanced to be one which the Harpers had seen in New Orleans the day it left there marching in faultless platoons and spotless equipments through the crowds that roared acclaim and farewell, our dear ladies, for one weak moment, wept. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Here come the real heroes, Harry,\" said my crippled leader; \"we are dandies and toy-soldiers, by the side of those infantry boys, Doctor, we cavalry fellows;\" and we cavalry fellows would have hid if we honorably could. Yet hardly had he spoken when he and a passing field-officer cried out in mutual recognition, and from that time until the rear-guard was clear gone by we received what the newspapers call \"a continuous ovation.\" A group of brigade officers went back with us to Squire Wall\u0027s, to supper, and you could see by the worship they paid Charlotte that they knew her story. Her strength was far overtaxed, and the moment the last fond straggler had gone we came in out of the splendid moonlight. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Now, Charlotte, my dear,\" began Miss Harper, \"you are too terribly tired to--why, where is Charlotte; did she not come in with us from the--gate?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Ferry, too, was missing. Mrs. Wall made eyes at the inquirer, Estelle and Cécile began to speak but deferred to each other, and Camille, putting on a deadly exhaustion, whined as she tottered to her smiling guardian, \"Kiss your sweet baby good-night, auntie dear, and\"--with a hand reached out to Estelle--\"make Naughty come, too.\" She turned to say good-night to Cécile but spoiled her kiss with an unintended laugh. The surgeon, Harry and I bowed from the room and stepped out to the water-bucket and gourd. From there we could see the missing two, lingering at the dooryard gate, in the bright moonlight. As we finished drinking, \"Gentlemen,\" murmured Harry, \"I fear our position is too exposed to be tenable.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The surgeon started upstairs. \"I\u0027ll join you directly, Doctor,\" Harry said, and in a lower voice added \"Smith and I will just lounge in and out of the hall here to sort o\u0027 show nobody needn\u0027t be in any hurry, don\u0027t you see?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n But the other jerked his thumb toward the half-closed parlor, where Miss Harper and Cécile sat close, to each other absorbed in some matter of the tenderest privacy. \"They\u0027ll attend to that,\" he muttered; \"come on to bed and mind your own business.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Harry huffed absurdly. \"You go mind yours,\" he retorted, and then more generously added, \"we\u0027ll be with you in a minute.\" The surgeon went, and the aide-de-camp, as we began to pace the hall, fairly took my breath by remarking without a hint of self-censure, \"Damn a frivolous man!\" Then irrelatively he added, \"Those two out at that gate--this is a matter of life and death with them;\" and when I would have qualified the declaration, he broke in upon me--\"Right, Dick, you\u0027re right, it is worse; it\u0027s a choice between true life and death-in-life; whether they\u0027ll make life\u0027s long march in sunshine together or in darkness apart.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Well, of course, it was no such simple question, and never could be while life held so many values more splendid than any wilfulness could win. There lay the whole of Charlotte\u0027s real difficulty--for she had made it all hers. But when I tried in some awkward way to say this Harry cut me short. \"Oh, Dick, I--eh--you bother me! I want to tell you something and if I don\u0027t hurry I can\u0027t. Something\u0027s happened to me, old fellow, something that\u0027s sobered me more than I ever would \u0027a\u0027 thought anything could. I want to tell you because I can trust you with a secr\u0027--wh\u0027--what\u0027s the matter, did I hurt your wound? Honestly, I want to tell you because--well--because I\u0027ve been deceiving you all along: I\u0027ve deceived you shamefully, letting on to like this girl more than that, and so on and so on.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, you thought you were deceiving me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, well, maybe I wasn\u0027t, but I want to tell you to-night because I\u0027m going to camp in the morning. Oh, yes,\"--he named the deepest place known--\"the sight of those webfoot boys to-day was too much for me; I\u0027m going; and Dick, when I told her I was going--\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Told whom?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Aw, come, now, Dick, you know every bit as well as I know. Well, when I told her I was going I didn\u0027t dream I was going to tell her anything else; I give you my word! Where in the\"--same place again--\"I ever got the courage I\u0027ll never tell you, but all of a sudden thinks I, \u0027I\u0027m never going to get anything but no, anyhow, and so, Dick, I\u0027ve been and gone and done it!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n I leaned on the stair-newel, sorry for the poor fool, but glad of this chance. \"Why, Lieutenant, not many men would have done as well. You felt honor-bound not to slip away uncommitted, so you took your dose like a hero and licked the spoon.\" I felt that I was salting his wound, but we were soldiers and--I had the salt. \\n\\n \\n\\n He drew a sigh. \"Yes, I took my dose--of astonishment. Dick, she said yes! Oh, good Lord, Dick, do you reckon they\u0027ll ever be such full-blown idiots as to let me have her?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n I sank upon the steps; every pore in my body was a fountain of cold sweat: \"Have whom?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Cécile.\" He was going on to declare himself no more fit for her than for the presidency of the Confederate States, which was perfectly true; but I sprang up, caught him (on my well side) by one good hand, and had begun my enthusiastic congratulations, when Charlotte appeared and we swerved against the rail to let her pass upstairs. In some way as she went by it was made plain to us that she had said no. \"Good-night,\" ventured both of us, timorously. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Good-night,\" she responded, very musically, but as if from a great distance. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2561/70573.html","bookId":414,"book":{"id":414,"title":"The Cavalier","description":"简介： Our camp was in the heart of Copiah County, Mississippi, a mile or so west of Gallatin and about six miles east of that once robber-haunted road, the Natchez Trace.
