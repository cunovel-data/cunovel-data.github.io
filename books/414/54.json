{"id":44083,"no":54,"title":"LIV THE FIGHT IN THE DOORWAY","content":"Charlotte\u0027s whisper came to me: \"Richard!\" Standing by Ferry\u0027s pillow she spoke for him. \"If they start upstairs come and stand like me, on the other side.\" I nodded and slyly opened the door enough to pass half-way out. Some man was parleying with Miss Harper. \"Now, madam, you know you haven\u0027t locked up your parlor to maintain an abstract right; you\u0027ve locked it up because you\u0027ve got the man in there that I\u0027ve come for.\" \"Whom have you come for, sir?\" \"Lieutenant O\u0027Brien, of the rebel army. Shall I order this man to kick that door in? Answer quickly.\" \"Sir, there is no Lieutenant O\u0027Brien in there, nor elsewhere in this house; there never has been.\" \"Stand aside, madam.\" \"Stop, sir! I command you! There is no Lieutenant of any name on this place!\" \"Oh, yes there is; he goes by various names, but one of them is Ned Ferry. Sergeant, we\u0027ll kick together; now!\"--Bang! I leaned back into the room to say \"It\u0027s all right! Oh, but that sweet woman\u0027s a \u0027coon! Let them batter!\" As I thrust my head out again Miss Harper was exclaiming \"Oh, sirs, don\u0027t do that!\"--Bang!--\"For the honor of your calling and your flag--\" Bang! \"There\u0027s no Lieutenant in there.\" Bang! \"Corporal, go find an axe or something.\" \"Oh, you need not, sirs, I\u0027ll unlock the door.\" \"Well, be quick about it, and then stand clear; we don\u0027t want any woman hurt.\" The key rattled at the keyhole and then dropped to the floor. \"You did that by intention! Give me that key!\" He tried the lock. \"We\u0027ve jammed it, corporal, but another good kick will fetch it; now!\"--Bang!--crash!--open flew the door. \"Well, I will be damned!\" said the officer. \"Sir,\" said Miss Harper, \"you give me no occasion to doubt it.\" She followed the men upstairs. \"Estelle, go back to your sister and cousin; and if you, my dear,\"--to our hostess--\"will kindly go also, and stay with them--\" I closed the door. It had no key, but there was a small catch to the knob and I turned it on while the men were looking into the adjacent rooms. When they reached ours Miss Harper was again at their front. Inside, the three of us silently noted our strategic advantages: we were in the darkest part of the room, the bed\u0027s covering was a dull red, Ferry had on his shirt of black silk, the white pillows were hidden at his back, Charlotte and I were darkly clad, the light from our west window would be in our assailants\u0027 faces as they entered, and they would be silhouetted against a similar light from the hall\u0027s front. We noiselessly cocked our weapons and Charlotte and I each sank to one knee. \"The door is very thin,\" murmured Ferry, \"we can fire before they enter; they will get, anyhow, our smoke, and if they fire as they rush in we can aim under their flash.\" It was only then that I observed that Charlotte was armed. But the fact made her seem only the more a true woman, since I knew that only for her honor or his life would she ever take deadly aim. Her weapon was the slender revolver she had carried ever since the day which had made her Charlotte Oliver, the thing without which she never could have reached this hour of blissful extremity. \"In here there is a lady, ill,\" we heard Miss Harper say. \"Is she alone?\" Ferry prompted in a whisper, the three of us cried \"Yes!\" and he added \"Pass one side from the door, Miss Harper, we are going to shoot through it.\" \"Hello, in there! Lieutenant Ferry, of Ferry\u0027s scouts,\"-- \"Captain Ferry,\" retorted Miss Harper, and I echoed the amendment. \"Damn the difference; I give you one half-minute, Captain Ferry, to say you surrender! If you weren\u0027t wounded I wouldn\u0027t give you that. Corporal, go get a log out of that fireplace downstairs.\" \"Oh, shame!\" wailed Miss Harper, half-way down the hall. \"Captain,\" called Ferry, \"I give you one quarter-minute to get away from that door.\" He whispered to Charlotte, pointing to a panel of it higher than any one\u0027s head. \"Oh, sirs,\" we again heard Miss Harper cry, \"withhold! Captain Ferry, they have called in four more men!\" We heard the four downstairs coming at a run. \"Oh, sir--\" \"Go away, madam!\" bellowed the officer as his men thundered into the upper hall. \"Now, Captain Ferry, there are six of us here and three under each of your windows. Do you--?\" \"Oh, sir, the lady! the sick lady!\" \"That\u0027s his look-out, madam. If the sick lady isn\u0027t Charlotte Oli\u0027--\" \"And if she is?\" called Ferry, depressing Charlotte\u0027s weapon to an aim barely breast high. \"Then throwing away your life won\u0027t save hers! Do you surren\u0027--?\" Ferry made a quick gesture for her to shoot low, but she solemnly shook her head and fired through the top of the uppermost panel, and the assault came. The log burst the door in at a blow, Ferry and I fired, and our foes sprang in. Certainly they were brave; the doorway let them in only by twos, and the fire-log, falling under foot, became a stumbling-block; yet in an instant the room was ringing and roaring with the fray and benighted with its smoke. Their first ball bit the top of my shoulder and buried itself in the wall--no, not their first, but the first save one; for the bureau mirror stood in dim shade, and the Federal leader made the easy mistake of firing right into it. The error sealed his fate; Ferry fired under his flash and sent him reeling into the arms of his followers. They replied hotly but blindly, and in a moment the room was void of assailants. Ferry started to spring from the bed, but Charlotte threw her arms about him, and as she pressed her head hard down on his breast I could not help but hear \"No, my treasure, my heart\u0027s whole treasure, no!\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2561/70570.html","bookId":414,"book":{"id":414,"title":"The Cavalier","description":"简介： Our camp was in the heart of Copiah County, Mississippi, a mile or so west of Gallatin and about six miles east of that once robber-haunted road, the Natchez Trace.
