{"id":44080,"no":51,"title":"LI UNDER THE ROOM WHERE CHARLOTTE LAY","content":"The fight was over only in degree. Our brigade was drawing away into the north and the enemy were pressing revengefully after them. Our hundreds of prisoners and our few wounded were being taken back eastward over the road by which we had come in the night, and even after we had turned into it I saw a Yankee shell kill a wounded man and his horse not thirty yards from me. \\n\\n \\n\\n Before we had gone another mile I met Harry Helm. The General had left him in camp with flat orders to remain, but at daylight he had ridden out to find us. He was in two tremendous moods at once; lifted to heaven on the glory of our deeds, yet heart-broken over the fate of Ned Ferry. \"Surgeon\u0027s told him he can\u0027t live, Dick! And all the effect that\u0027s had--\u0027No opiates, then, Doctor,\u0027 s\u0027e, \u0027till I get off these two or three despatches.\u0027 So there he lies in that ambulance cross-questioning prisoners and making everybody bring him every scrap of information, as if he were General Austin and Major Harper rolled into one and they were wounded instead of him--By George! Dick, he knows you\u0027re hit and just how you\u0027re hit, and has sent me to find you!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n I said I thought I could gallop if Harry could, and in a few minutes we were up with the ambulance. It had stopped. There were several men about it, including Sergeant Jim and Kendall, which two had come from Quinn, and having just been in the ambulance, at Ferry\u0027s side, were now remounting, both of them openly in tears. \"Hello, Kendall.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hello, Smith.\" He turned sharply from me, horse and all. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Good-morning, sergeant, is Lieutenant Ferry--worse?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The sergeant only jabbed in the spurs, and leapt away with Kendall, bearing despatches to the brigade. Harry, looking back to me from the ambulance, called softly, \"All right again; it was only a bad swoon!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hello, Smith,\" said some one whom I was too sick and dizzy to recognize, \"one of those prisoners says he saw Oliver dead.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n They say two or three men sprang to catch me, but the first thing I knew was that the ambulance was under way and I in it on my back within elbow-touch of Ferry, looking up into a surgeon\u0027s face. \"How\u0027s the Lieutenant?\" I asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh--getting on, getting on,\" he replied. Doctors think patients are fools. \\n\\n \\n\\n In a parlor under the room where Charlotte lay they made a bed for Ferry and one for me, and here, lapped in luxury and distinction, I promptly fell asleep, and when I reopened my eyes it was again afternoon. In the other bed Ferry was slumbering, and quite across the room, beside a closed door, sat Cécile and Camille. The latter tiptoed to me. Her whispers were as soft as breathing, and when I answered or questioned, her ear sank as near as you would put a rose to smell it. \"The Lieutenant, sleeping? yes, this hour past; surgeons surprised and more hopeful. Miss Estelle? in another room with other wounded. Her aunt? upstairs with Charlotte, who was--oh--getting on, getting on.\" That made me anxious. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Does Charlotte,\" I asked, \"know--everything?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Camille allowed herself all the motions of a laugh, and said \"No, not quite everything;\" and then with solemn tenderness she added that Charlotte knew about Ferry. \"And she knows about you,\" the whisperer went on; \"they all know.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n I thought she was alluding to the verses, and had an instant of terror and rage before I saw what she meant. She glided back to the door and the two opened it an inch or so to answer some inquirer without. I saw her no more until bedtime, when she stood at her aunt\u0027s elbow to hand and hold things, while Miss Harper, to my all but screaming embarrassment, bared the whole upper half of one side of me and washed and dressed my wound anew. Ferry it was imperative to let alone, but when I awoke the next morning there was a radiance of joy throughout all the house; for he had slept and improved. The next morning again he was ever so much stronger, and Harry Helm rode off in simulated disgust, not seeing \"any fun in hanging round girls who were hanging round other fellows.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Another day arose. A courier brought passes for our three or four other wounded to go home as soon as they were fit to travel, and by night they were all gone. At early bedtime came two surgeons of high rank all the way from Johnston\u0027s army up in Mississippi. General Austin had asked this favor by telegraph. Harry had been gone thirty-six hours, and Ferry was just asking if he had not yet got back, when the surgeons came in to the room. A pleasantry or two consumed a few moments. Then the surgeon in charge of us told of a symptom or two, to which they responded only \"hmm,\" and began the examination. Miss Harper sent her three nieces away. I lay and listened in the busy stillness. Presently one of the examiners murmured with a certain positiveness to the other, who after a moment\u0027s silence replied with conviction; Miss Harper touched our surgeon\u0027s arm inquiringly and he looked back in a glad way and nodded. Miss Harper nodded to me; they had located the ball! Now the conversation turned upon men and events of the day, while one of the visitors, with his back to the patient, opened a case of glittering knives. Presently the professional heads came so close together as quite to hide the patient; they spoke once or twice in a manly soothing tone. Miss Harper stroked my temples to keep me down, one of the busy ones spoke again, and lo! the thing was done, there was the ball in the basin. As the men of blood sped through their kind after-work the news flew to and fro; Camille wept,--since she could not hurrah,--Cécile told Charlotte, the heavenly-minded Estelle was confirmed in her faith, Miss Harper\u0027s black eyes, after a brief overflow, were keener and kindlier than ever, and as the surgeons spoke the word \"done,\" Ferry asked again if Harry had not got back yet. Pretty soon Harry did arrive, with news of great feats by our cavalry against our old enemy Grierson, in which Austin\u0027s brigade had covered themselves with glory, and in which he had had his own share; his hand was swelled as big as his heart. In all the Confederacy no houseful went to sleep that night in sweeter content. I sank into perfect bliss planning a double wedding. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2561/70567.html","bookId":414,"book":{"id":414,"title":"The Cavalier","description":"简介： Our camp was in the heart of Copiah County, Mississippi, a mile or so west of Gallatin and about six miles east of that once robber-haunted road, the Natchez Trace.
