{"id":44088,"no":59,"title":"LIX UNDER CHARLOTTE\u0027S WINDOW","content":"At the tavern, where we went to smarten up and to eat, we chanced upon Gregory. He was very shy of Ferry, because Ferry was a captain, but told me the latest news from the Wall place, where he had spent the previous evening. Harry and the surgeon were gone to camp, the Harpers were well, Charlotte was--better, after a bad turn of several days. We felt in duty bound to stay within hail of the telegraph office until it should close for the night; and when the operator was detained in it much beyond the usual time, Ferry, as we hovered near, said at length, \"Well, I\u0027m sorry for you, Dick; \u0027tis now too late for you to go yonder--this evening.\" \"Didn\u0027t you intend to call, too?\" \"No,\" he said; yet the moment the operator turned the key in his door we sauntered away from the station, tavern, town, and out into the rain-famished country. We chose a road on high ground, under pines; the fact that a few miles of it would bring us to Squire Wall\u0027s was not sufficient reason for us to shun it, and we loitered on and on, discoursing philosophically on man and woman and the duties of each to other. Through habit we went softly, and so, in time, came up past a small garden under the house\u0027s southern side. Here silence was only decorum, for every window in the dark upper rooms was thrown open to the sultry air. The house\u0027s front was away from the direction of the town, and at a corner of this garden, where the road entered the open grove, the garden fence turned north at a right angle, while the road went on through the grove into wide cornfields beyond. We kept to the garden fence till it brought us along the dooryard front, facing the house. Thus far the whole place seemed fast asleep. Along the farthest, the northern, side a line of planted trees ran close to a narrow wing of but one room on each of its two stories, and the upper of these two rooms was Charlotte\u0027s. Where we paused, at the dooryard gate, we could not see this wing, but we knew its exterior perfectly; it had a narrow window in front, looking into the grove, and a broader one at the rear, that overlooked an open stretch of the Wall plantation. The place seemed fast asleep, I say, but we had not a doubt we were being watched--by the two terrible dogs that guarded the house but never barked. By this time they should have recognized us and ought to be coming forward and wagging faintly, as who should say \"Yes, that\u0027s all right, but we have our orders.\" \"Ah!\"--Ferry guardedly pointed to the ground at the corner of the house nearest Charlotte\u0027s room; there were both the dogs, dim as phantoms and as silent, standing and peering not toward us but around to the wing side in a way to make one\u0027s blood stop. We drew deeper into the grove and made a short circuit that brought us in line with Charlotte\u0027s two windows, and there, at the farther one, with her back to us, sat Charlotte, looking toward Hazlehurst. The bloodthirsty beasts at the corner of the house were so intently waiting to spring upon something, somebody, between them and the nearer window, that we were secure from their notice. We had hardly more than become aware of these things when, in the line of planted trees, out of the depths of the one nearest the nearer window, sounded a note that brought Charlotte instantly to her feet; the same feeble, smothered cry she had heard the night she was wounded. She crossed to the front window and listened, first standing erect, and then stooping and leaning out. When we saw her do that we knew how little she cared for her life; Ferry beckoned me up from behind him; neither of us needed to say he feared the signal was from Oliver. \"Watch here,\" he whispered, and keeping the deepest shade, started eagerly, with drawn revolver, toward the particular tree. I saw the dogs discover and recognize him and welcome his aid, yet I kept my closest watch on that tree\u0027s boughs and on Charlotte. She was wondering, I guessed, whether the call was from some messenger of Ferry, or was only a bird\u0027s cry. As if she decided it was the latter, she moved away, and had nearly re-crossed the room, when the same sad tremolo came searching the air again. Nevertheless she went on to the farther window and stood gazing out for the better part of a minute, while in my heart I besought her not to look behind. For Ferry and the dogs had vanished in shadow, and outside her nearer window, wavering now above and now below the sill, I could just descry a small pale object that reminded me of that missive Coralie Rothvelt had passed up to me outside the window-sill at old Lucius Oliver\u0027s house exactly a month before. From the upper depths of the nearest tree this small thing was being proffered on the end of a fishing-rod. Presently the rod must have tapped the sill, with such a start did she face about. Silently she ran, snatched the dumb messenger, and drew down the window-shade. A moment later the room glowed with a candle, while her shadow, falling upon the shade, revealed her scanning a letter, lifting her arms with emotion, and so passing out of the line of view. I waited on. So absorbed was I that I did not hear the coming of a horseman in the fields beyond the grove, nor the click of a field gate; but when the strange quietude of Ferry and the dogs had begun to reassure me I became aware of this new-comer approaching the dooryard. There he reined in and hallooed. I knew the voice. An answer came from an upper window. \"Is this Squire Wall\u0027s?\" asked the traveller. \"Well, Squire, I\u0027m from General Austin\u0027s headquarters, with orders to Captain Ferry.\" \"Captain Ferry ain\u0027t stopping with us now, sir, he\u0027s \u0027way up at Hazlehurst.\" \"Yes, sir. I didn\u0027t know but he might \u0027a\u0027 come down to spend to-morrow with you, it being the Sabbath. My name\u0027s Gholson, sir; I\u0027ve got letters for the Miss Harpers; yes, sir; and one for Private Smith, from his mother, in New Orleans.\" \"My sakes! yo\u0027 pow\u0027ful welcome, Mr. Wholesome; just wait till I call off my dogs, sir, and I\u0027ll let you in.\" When the dogs came at the Squire\u0027s call I breathed relief. Ferry appeared behind me and beckoned me deeper into the grove. He sank upon a stump, whispering \"That was worse than ten fights.\" \"Who was it?\" I asked. \"Where is he?\" He pointed to the field gate through which Gholson had come. In the field a small man was re-closing it cautiously, and now he mounted and rode away; it was Isidore Goldschmidt, of the Plank-road swamp. I was wondering why he had behaved in this skulking way, when Ferry, as if reading my thought, said, \"Isidore can\u0027t afford to be found seventy-five miles inside our lines with no papers except a letter from a Yankee officer--and not knowing, himself, what\u0027s in it.\" \"Oh! why should he risk his life to bring such a thing to her?\" \"Because three months ago she risked her life to save the life of his father, and now, since only last week, that Yankee has saved the life of his mother.\" I asked who this Yankee might be. \"Well, that is yet more strange; he is the brother of Captain Jewett.\" We were moving to the house; at the steps we halted; the place was all alight and the ladies were arriving in the parlor. A beam of light touching Ferry\u0027s face made his smile haggard. I asked if this Jewett was another leader of scouts. \"No, he is a high-rank surgeon. Yet I think he must have heard all about her; he wouldn\u0027t send that letter, that way, just for gratitude.\" \"Yes,\" I responded, pondering, \"he may easily have learned about her,\" and I called to mind that chief-of-staff of whom Charlotte had told us. Then, remembering her emotional shadow-play on the window-shade, I added, \"He knew at least what would be important news to her--Captain, I have it!\" He made a motion of pain--\"Don\u0027t say it!\" and we read in each other\u0027s eyes the one conviction that from a surgeon\u0027s personal knowledge this man had written to warn Charlotte that Oliver was alive.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2561/70575.html","bookId":414,"book":{"id":414,"title":"The Cavalier","description":"简介： Our camp was in the heart of Copiah County, Mississippi, a mile or so west of Gallatin and about six miles east of that once robber-haunted road, the Natchez Trace.
