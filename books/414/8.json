{"id":44037,"no":8,"title":"VIII ANOTHER CURTAINED WAGON","content":"\n Upon whatever fundamental scheme we perseveringly concentrate our powers, upon whatever main road of occupation we take life\u0027s journey,--art, politics, commerce, science,--if only we will take its upper fork as often as the road divides, then will that road itself, and not necessarily any cross-road, lead us to the noblest, truest plane of convictions, affections, aspirations. Such a frame of mind may be quite without religiosity, as unconscious as health; but the proof of its religious reality will be that, as if it were a lighthouse light and we its keeper, everybody else, or at any rate everybody out on the deep, will see it plainer than we. Such is the gist of what this young man was saying to me, when our speculations were brought to an end by our overtaking a man well mounted, and a woman whose rough-gaited was followed by a colt. \n \n The pair took our pace, the man plying me with questions, and his wife, in front, telling Lieutenant Durand all the rumors of the day. Her scant hair was of a scorched red tone, she was freckled down into her collar, her elbows waggled to the mare\u0027s jog, and her voice was as flat as a duck\u0027s. Her nag had trouble to keep up, and her tiny faded bonnet had even more to keep on. Yet the day was near when the touch of those freckled hands was to seem to me kinder than the breath of flowers, as they bathed my foul-smelling wounds, and she would say, in the words of the old song, \"Let me kiss him for his mother,\" and I should be helpless to prevent her. By and by the man raised his voice:-- \n \n \"Why, yo\u0027 name is Smith, to be sho\u0027! I thought you was jest a-tryin\u0027 to chaw me. Why, Major Harper alludened to you not mo\u0027n a half-ow ago. Why, Miz Wall! oh, Miz Wall!\" \n \n But the wife was absorbed. \"Yayse, seh,\" she was saying to the lieutenant, \"and he told us about they comin\u0027 in on the freight-kyahs f\u0027om Hazlehurst black with dust and sut and a-smuttyin\u0027 him all oveh with they kisses and goin\u0027s-on. He tol\u0027 me he ain\u0027t neveh so enjoyed havin\u0027 his face dirty sence he was a boy. He would a-been plumb happy, ef on\u0027y he could a-got his haynds on that clerk o\u0027 his\u0027n. And when he tol\u0027 us what a gay two-hoss turn-out he\u0027d sekyo\u0027ed for the ladies to travel in, s\u0027 I, Majo\u0027, that\u0027s all right! You jest go on whicheveh way you got to go! Husband and me, we\u0027ll ride into Brookhaven and bring \u0027em out to ow place and jest take ca\u0027e of \u0027em untel yo\u0027 clerk is found.\" \n \n \"Miz Wall!\" cried the husband--\"She\u0027s busy talkin\u0027.--Miz Wall!--she don\u0027t hyuh me. I hate to interrupt heh.--Oh, Miz Wall! hyuh\u0027s Majo\u0027 Harper\u0027s clerk, right now!\" \n \n \"Law, you hain\u0027t!\" cried Mrs. Wall, smiling back as she jounced. \"If you air, the Majo\u0027s sisteh\u0027s got written awdehs fo\u0027 you.\" \n \n I shot forward, but had hardly more than sent back my good-bye when around a bend of the road, in a wagon larger than Charlotte Oliver\u0027s, with the curtains rolled up, came the four Miss Harpers, unsooted and radiant. The aunt drove. We turned, all four, and rode with them, and while the seven chatted gaily I read to myself the Major\u0027s note. It bade me take these four ladies into my most jealous care and conduct them to a point about thirty miles west of where we then were. A dandy\u0027s task in a soldier\u0027s hour! I ground my teeth, but as I lifted my glance I found Camille\u0027s eyes resting on me and read anxiety in them before she could put on a smile of unemotional friendliness that faded rapidly into abstraction. She was as pretty as the bough of wild azaleas in her hand, yet moving forward I told her aunt the order\u0027s purport and that it implied the greatest despatch compatible with mortal endurance. The whole four seemed only delighted. \n \n But Mrs. Wall protested. No, no, her hospitality first, and a basket of refreshments to be stowed in the vehicle, besides. \"Why, that\u0027ll sa-ave ti-ime. You-all goin\u0027 to be supprised to find how hungry y\u0027all ah, befo\u0027 you come to yo\u0027 journey\u0027s en\u0027, to-night, and them col\u0027 victuals goin\u0027 taste pow\u0027ful fi-ine!\" \n \n Our acceptance was unanimous. I even decided not to inform Lieutenant Durand until after the repast, that ladies under my escort did not pick acquaintanceship with soldiers on the public highway. But before the brief meal was over I was wishing him hanged. Hang the heaven-high theories that had so lately put me in love with him! Hang his melodious voice, his modest composure, his gold-barred collar, his easy command of topics! Hang the women! they feasted on his every word and look! Ah, ladies! if I were mean enough to tell it--that man doesn\u0027t believe in hell! He has a down-dragging hunger for every base indulgence; he has told me so! \n \n How fast acquaintance grew! When he addressed himself to Cécile, the cousin of the other two, her black eyes leapt with delight; for as calmly as if that were the only way, he spoke to her in French--asked her a question. She gave answer in happiest affirmation, and explained to her aunt that her Durand schoolmates of a year or two back were cousins to the Lieutenant. When the throng came out to the carry-all I was there and mounted. Squire Wall took me a few rods to point out where a fork of his private road led into the highway. Then the carry-all came merrily after, and with a regret that surprised me I answered our Lieutenant\u0027s farewell wave, forgave him all his charms, and saw him face westward and disappear by a bridle-path. \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2561/70524.html","bookId":414,"book":{"id":414,"title":"The Cavalier","description":"简介： Our camp was in the heart of Copiah County, Mississippi, a mile or so west of Gallatin and about six miles east of that once robber-haunted road, the Natchez Trace.
