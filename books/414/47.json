{"id":44076,"no":47,"title":"XLVII HE\u0027S DEAD.--IS SHE ALIVE?","content":"Cries of masculine anger and feminine affright filled the hall, but one ringing order for silence hushed all, and the dance stood still with Ned Ferry in its centre. In his right hand, shoulder high, he held not his sword, but Charlotte\u0027s fingers lightly poised for the turn in the arrested dance. \"Stand, gentlemen, every man is covered by two; look at the doors; look at the windows.\" The staff captain daringly sprang for the front door, but Ferry\u0027s quick boot caught his instep and he struck the floor full length. Like lightning Ferry\u0027s sword was out, but he only gave it a deferential sweep. \"Sir! better luck next time!--Lieutenant Quinn, put the Captain in your front rank.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Quinn hustled the captives \"down a lane,\" as the fiddler might have said, of Ferry\u0027s scouts, mounted them on their own horses at the door, and hurried them away. Charlotte had vanished but was back again in hat and riding-skirt. Ferry caught her hand and they ran to the front veranda steps just as the prisoners and guard rode swiftly from them. Kendall and I had the stirrup ready for her; the saddle was a man\u0027s, but she made a horn of its pommel, and in a flash the four of us were mounted. Nevertheless before we could move the grove resounded with shots, and Ferry, bidding us ride on after the fleeing guard, wheeled and galloped to where half our troop were holding back their assailants in the dark. But then, to our distraction, Charlotte would not fly. \"Richard, I\u0027m paroled!\"--\"Charlotte Oliver, you\u0027re my prisoner!\" I reached for her bridle, but she avoided me and with a cry of recollection wheeled and was on her way back. \"I forgot something! I can get it, I left the room lighted!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n I remember vividly yet the high purpose and girlish propitiation that rang together in her voice. Kendall dashed after her while I went against a wet bough that all but threw me; but before he could reach her she flew up the steps, crying \"Hold my horse!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mine, too!\" I cried, springing up after her. How queerly the inner house stood alight and silent, its guests and inmates hidden, while outside pistols and carbines flashed and cracked. I came upon Charlotte, just recrossing her chamber to leave it, with her doll in her arms. \"Come!\" I cried, \"our line is falling back behind the house!\" Her head flinched aside, a bit of her hat flew from it, and a pistol-ball buried itself in the ceiling straight over my head. We ran downstairs together, pulling, pushing and imploring each other in the name of honor, duty and heaven to let him--let her--go out first through the bright hall door. Kendall was not in sight, but in a dim half-light a few yards off we saw Oliver. He was afoot, bending low, and gliding toward us with his revolver in his left hand. He fired as I did; her clutch spoiled my aim; with eager eyes she straightened to her finest height, cried \"Richard! tell Lieutenant Ferry he--\" and with a long sigh sank into my arms. A rush of hoofs sounded behind Oliver, he glanced up, and Ferry\u0027s blade fell across his brow and launched him face upward to the ground. I saw a bunch of horses, with mine, at the foot of the steps, and a bunch of men at the top; Ferry snatched Charlotte\u0027s limp form from me and said over his shoulder as he went down the steps, \"Go get him and bring him along, dead or alive!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n I called a man to my aid and was unlucky in not getting the cool-headed Kendall, for my own wits were gone. The next moment all had left us and I was down on the ground toiling frantically, with no help but one hand of my mounted companion, to heave the stalwart frame of Oliver up to my saddle. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why, he\u0027s dead!\" cried the lad, letting him slide half-way down when we had all but got him up; \"don\u0027t you see he\u0027s dead? His head\u0027s laid wide open! He\u0027s as dead as a mackerel! I\u0027ll swear we ain\u0027t got any right to get captured trying to save a dead Yankee.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n I was in despair; our horses had caught our frenzy and were plunging to be after their fellows, and a fresh body of the enemy were hurtling into the grove. Dropping my burden I vaulted up, and we scurried away, saved only by the enemy\u0027s healthy fear of an ambush. The first man we came up with was Quinn, with the rear-guard. \"Is he dead?\" he growled. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Dead as Adam!\" said I, and my comrade put in \"Head laid wide open!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"drop back into the ranks,\" said Quinn to him. \"Smith, ride on to Lieutenant Ferry. Corporal,\"--to a man near him--\"you know the way so well, go with him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The two of us sprang forward. How long or what way we went I have now no clear idea, but at length we neared again the grapevine ferry. The stream was swollen, we swam our horses, and on the farther side we found Kendall waiting. To the corporal\u0027s inquiry he replied that Ferry had just passed on. \"You know Roy\u0027s; two miles off the Plank Road by the first right? He expects to stop there.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Is she alive, Kendall?\" I interrupted. \"Is she alive?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No,\" said he, to some further question of the corporal; \"I\u0027m to wait here for the command.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Is she alive, Kendall?\" I asked again. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hello, Smith.\" He scanned my dripping horse. \"Your saddle\u0027s slipped, Smith. Yes, she\u0027s alive.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2561/70563.html","bookId":414,"book":{"id":414,"title":"The Cavalier","description":"简介： Our camp was in the heart of Copiah County, Mississippi, a mile or so west of Gallatin and about six miles east of that once robber-haunted road, the Natchez Trace.
