{"id":44047,"no":18,"title":"VIII THE JAYHAWKERS","content":"IT was well that I was on the Federal captain\u0027s horse. He knew this sort of work and could do it quicker and more quietly than mine. Mine would have whinnied for the camp and watched for short cuts to it. Another advantage was the moon, and the hour was hardly beyond midnight when I saw a light in a window and heard the scraping of a fiddle. At the edge of a clearing enclosed by a worm fence I came to a row of slave-cabins. Mongrel dogs barked through the fence, and in one angle of it a young white man with long straight hair showed himself so abruptly as to startle my horse. Only the one cabin was lighted, and thence came the rhythmic shuffle of bare-footed dancers while the fiddle played \"I lay ten dollars down.\" There were three couples on the floor, and I saw--for the excited dogs had pushed the door open--that two of the men were white, though but one wore shoes. On him the light fell revealingly as he and the yellow girl before him passed each other in the dance and faced again. He was decidedly blond. The other man, though silhouetted against the glare of burning pine-knots, I knew to be white by the flapping of his lank locks about his cheeks as he lent his eyes to the improvisation of his steps. His partner was a young black girl. I burned with scorn, and doubtless showed it, although I only asked whose plantation this was. \n \n \"This-yeh pla-ace?\" The rustic dragged his words lazily, chewed tobacco with his whole face, and looked my uniform over from cap to spur. \"They say this-yeh place belong to a man which his name Lu-ucius Ol-i-veh.\" \n \n So! I honestly wished myself back in my old rags, until I reflected that my handsome mount was enough to get me all the damage these wretches could offer. Still I thought it safest to show an overbearing frown. \n \n \"To what command do you fellows belong?\" \n \n He spurted a pint to reply, \"Fishe\u0027s batt\u0027ry.\" \n \n \"Oh! And where is the battery?\" \n \n \"You sa-ay \u0027Whah is it?\u0027--ow batt\u0027ry\"--he champed noisily--\"I dunno. Does you? Whah is it?\" \n \n \"It\u0027s twenty miles off; why are you not with it? What are you doing here?\" \n \n \"You sa-ay \u0027What we a-doin\u0027 hyuh?\u0027 Well, suh, I mought sa-ay we ain\u0027t a-doin\u0027 nuth\u0027n\u0027; but I\"--he squirted again--\"will sa-ay that so fah as you see what we a-doin\u0027, you kin see, an\u0027 welcome; an\u0027 so fah as you don\u0027t see, it ain\u0027t none o\u0027 yo\u0027 damn\u0027 busi-ness.\" \n \n \"Oh, that\u0027s all right, I was only asking a friendly question.\" \n \n \"Yaas; well, that\u0027s all right, too, suh; I uz on\u0027y a-givin\u0027 you a frien\u0027ly aynsweh. I hope you like it.\" \n \n Our intercourse became more amiable and the fellow dragged in his advice that I spend the rest of the night at the house of Mr. Oliver. His acquaintance with that gentleman seemed to grow while we talked, and broke into bloom like a magician\u0027s rosebush. He described him as a kind old bird who made hospitality to strangers his meat and drink. A conjecture darted into my mind. \"Why, yes! that is his married son, is he not, yonder in the cabin; the one with the fair hair?\" \n \n \"Who?--eh,--ole man Ol-i-veh? You sa--ay \u0027Is that his ma\u0027-ied son, in yondeh; the one \u0027ith the fah hah? \u0027--Eh,--no--o, suh,--eh,--yass, suh,--yass! Oh, yass, suh, thass his--tha\u0027--thass his ma\u0027ied son, in thah; yass, suh, the one \u0027ith the fah hah; yass, suh. I thought you meant the yetheh one.\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t believe,\" said I, \"I\u0027d better put myself on the old gentleman when the mistress of the house is away.\" \n \n \"She ain\u0027t awa-ay.\" \n \n \"Is she not! Isn\u0027t she the Mrs. Oliver--Charlotte Oliver--who is such friends--she and her husband, I mean, of course,--\" \n \n \"Uv co\u0027se!\" The reptile giggled, squirted and nodded. \n \n \"--With General Austin,\" I continued, \"--and with Lieutenant Ferry?\" \n \n \"She air!\" He was pleased. \"Yass, we all good frien\u0027s togetheh.\" \n \n \"But if she--oh, yes!--Yes, to be sure; she could easily have got here yesterday afternoon.\" \n \n \"Thass thess when she arrove!\" It was fascinating to watch the animal\u0027s cunning play across his face. The fiddle\u0027s tune changed and the dance quickened. \n \n \"I naturally thought,\" resumed I, with a smile meant to refer to the blond dancer, \"that the madam must be away somewhere.\" \n \n My hearer grinned. \"Oh, that ain\u0027t no sign. Boys will be boys. You know that, yo\u0027se\u0027f. An\u0027 o\u0027 co\u0027se she know it. Oh, yass, she at home.\" \n \n \"Well, I reckon I\u0027ll stop all night.\" I began to move on. His eyes followed greedily. \n \n \"Sa-ay! I\u0027ll wrastle you fo\u0027 them-ah clo\u0027es.\" \n \n I waved a pleasant refusal and rode toward the house. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2561/70534.html","bookId":414,"book":{"id":414,"title":"The Cavalier","description":"简介： Our camp was in the heart of Copiah County, Mississippi, a mile or so west of Gallatin and about six miles east of that once robber-haunted road, the Natchez Trace.
