Two men were ahead of us riding abreast, and a few rods in front of them was a third horseman, apparently alone. Two others had pushed on, one to the house, the other for surgical aid. The two in the rear knew us and let us come up unchallenged; the corporal stayed with them, and I rode on to my leader\u0027s side. \\n\\n \\n\\n Charlotte lay in his double clasp balanced so lightly on the horse\u0027s crest as hardly to feel the jar of his motion, though her head lay as nearly level with it as Ferry\u0027s bending shoulders and the hollow of his lowered right arm would allow; from under his other arm her relaxed figure, in its long riding-skirt, trailed down over his knee and stirrup; her broad limp hat, as if it had been so placed in sport, hung at his back with its tie-ribbons round his throat, while the black masses of her hair spread in ravishing desolation over and under his supporting arm. Her face was fearfully pale, the brows glistened with the damp of nervous shock, and every few moments she feebly brought a handkerchief to her lips to wipe away the blood that rose to them with every sigh. Steadfastly, except when her eyes closed now and then in deathly exhaustion, her gaze melted into his like a suffering babe\u0027s into its mother\u0027s. From time to time a brief word passed between them, and with joy I noticed that it was always in French; I hoped with my whole heart and soul that they had already said things, and were saying things yet, which no one else ought to hear. I waited some time for his notice, and when he gave it it was only by saying to her in a full voice and in English \"Dick Smith is here, alongside of us.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Her response was a question, which he repeated: \"Is he hurt? no, Richard never gets hurt. Shall he tell us whatever he knows?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He bent low for the faint reply, and when it came he sparkled with pride. \"\u0027It matters little,\u0027 she says, \u0027to either of us, now.\u0027 Give your report; but I tell you\"--there came a tiger look in his eyes--\"there is now no turning back; we shall go on.\" I answered with soft elation: \"My news needn\u0027t turn you back: Oliver is dead.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He drew a long breath, murmured \"My God!\" and then suddenly asked \"You found him so, or--?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We found him so; had to leave him so; head laid wide open; we were about to be captured--thought the news would be better than nothing--\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Certainly, yes, certainly. Now I want you to ride to the brigade camp and telegraph Miss Harper this: \u0027She needs you. Come instantly. Durand.\u0027\"--I repeated it to him.--\"Right,\" he said. \"Send that first; and after that--here is a military secret for you to tell to General Austin; I think you like that kind, eh? Tell him I would not send it verbally if I had my hands free. You know that regiment at whose headquarters we saw them singing; well, tell him they are to make a move to-day, a bad mistake, and I think if he will stay right there where he is till they make it, we can catch the whole lot of them. As soon as they move I shall report to him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Two gasping words from Charlotte brought his ear down, and with a worshipping light in his eyes he said to her \"Yes,--yes!\" and then to me, \"Yes, I shall report to him in person. Now, Smith, the top of your speed!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Reveillé was sounding as I entered the camp. In the middle of my story to the General--\"Saddle my horse,\" he said to an attendant, \"and send Mr. Gholson to me. Yes, Smith, well, what then?\"--I resumed, but in a minute--\"Mr. Gholson, good-morning. My compliments to Major Harper, Mr. Gholson, and ask him if he wouldn\u0027t like to take a ride with me; and let me have about four couriers; and send word to Colonel Dismukes that I shall call at his headquarters to see him a moment, on my way out of camp. Now, Smith, you\u0027ve given me the gist of the matter, haven\u0027t you? Oh, I think you have; good-morning.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Gholson had helped me get the despatch off to Miss Harper, whose coming no one could be more eager to hasten. Before leaving camp I saw him again. He was strangely reticent; my news seemed to benumb and sicken him. But as I remounted he began without connection--\"You see, she\u0027ll be absolutely alone until Miss Harper gets there; not a friend within call! He won\u0027t be there, she won\u0027t let him stay; she dislikes him too much; I know that, Smith. Why, Smith, she wouldn\u0027t ever \u0027a\u0027 let him carry her off the field if she\u0027d been conscious; she\u0027d sooner \u0027a\u0027 gone to Ship Island, or to death!\" He looked as though he would rather she had. His tongue, now it had started, could not stop. \"Ned Ferry can\u0027t stay by her; he mustn\u0027t! he hadn\u0027t ought to use around anywheres near her.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n I gave a sort of assent--attended with nausea--and turned to my saddle, but he clung. \"Why, how can he hang around that way, Smith, and he a suitor who\u0027s just killed her husband? Of course, now, he\u0027d ought to know he can\u0027t ever be one henceforth. I\u0027m sorry for him, but--\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Good-morning,\" I interrupted, quite in the General\u0027s manner, and made a spirited exit, but it proved a false one; one thing had to be said, and I returned. \"Gholson, if she should be worse hurt than--\" \"Ah! you\u0027re thinking of the chaplain; I\u0027ve already sent him. Yonder he goes, now; you can show him the way.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Understand,\" I said as I wheeled, \"I fully expect her to recover.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, oh, yes!\" replied my co-religionist, with feverish zest; \"we must have faith--for her sake! But o--oh! Smith, what a chastening judgment this is against dancing!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n I moved away, looking back at him, and seeing by his starved look how he was racking his jaded brain for some excuse to go with me, I honestly believe I was sorry for him. The chaplain was a thick-set, clean-shaven, politic little fellow whose \"Good-mawning, brothah?\" had the heavy sweetness of perfumed lard. We conversed fluently on spiritual matters and also on Ned Ferry. He asked me if the Lieutenant was \"a believer.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why,\" said I, \"as to that, Lieutenant Ferry believes there\u0027s something right about everything that\u0027s beautiful, and something wrong about everything that isn\u0027t. Now, of course that\u0027s a very dangerous idea, and yet--\" So I went on; ah me! the nightmare of it hangs over me yet, \"religionist\" though I am, after a fashion, unto this day. In Ferry\u0027s defence I maintained that only so much of any man\u0027s religion as fitted him, and fitted him not as his saddle or his clothes, but as his nervous system fitted him, was really his, or was really religion. I said I knew a man whose ready-made religion, small as it was, bagged all over him and made him as grotesque as a child in his father\u0027s trousers. The chaplain tittered so approvingly that I straightened to spout again, but just then we saw three distant figures that I knew at a glance. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There he is, now!--Excuse me, sir--\" I clapped in the spurs, but the chaplain clattered stoutly after me. The two horsemen moving from us were the General and Major Harper, and the one meeting them was Ned Ferry. Between the three and us rose out of a hollow the squad of couriers. And yonder came the sun. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2561/70564.html","bookId":414,"book":{"id":414,"title":"The Cavalier","description":"简介： Our camp was in the heart of Copiah County, Mississippi, a mile or so west of Gallatin and about six miles east of that once robber-haunted road, the Natchez Trace.
