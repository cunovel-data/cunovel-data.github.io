{"id":44085,"no":56,"title":"LVI H?TEL DES INVALIDES","content":"A shattered crew we were when in the forenoon of the third day we reached our goal. Harry\u0027s hand was giving him less trouble, but both my small wounds were misbehaving as stoutly as their limitations would allow; my aches were cruel and incessant, my side was swollen and my shoulder hot. Miss Harper was \"really ill,\" said the surgeon, but for whose coming with us we should hardly have brought our whole number through alive. Both Ferry and Charlotte were in a critical condition. \"Take you in!\" said our tearfully smiling Mrs. Wall; \"why, we\u0027d take yo\u0027 whole crowd in ef we had to go out and bunk undeh the trees owse\u0027v\u0027s!... Oh, Mr. Smith, you po\u0027 chi--ild!... Oh, my Lawd! is this Lieutenant Do-wrong! Good Lawd, good Lawd! I think this waugh\u0027s gone on now jess long enough!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n In the house she gave the younger Harpers a second kiss all round. \"You po\u0027 dears, yo\u0027re hero-ines, now, and hencefo\u0027th fo\u0027evehmo\u0027!\" Harry and I agreed they were; it was one of the few points on which we thought alike. We even agreed that Estelle\u0027s grasp of earthly realities was not so feeble as we had thought it. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Fact is,\" I said to him, on our first day at the Walls\u0027, as he was leaving the soldiers\u0027 room, where I sat under the surgeon\u0027s inspection, \"you were totally mistaken about her.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, I was,\" he replied; \"she\u0027s got more sense in a minute than Camille\u0027s got in a week,\" and shut the door between us. \\n\\n \\n\\n My blood leaped with rage, yet I sat perfectly calm, while the surgeon laughed like a hyena. \"As soon as you can let me go, Doctor,\" I frigidly said, \"I shall look up the Lieutenant. I consider that remark ungentlemanly, and his method of making it as worthy only of a coward.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The surgeon cackled again. \"If that man,\" I dispassionately resumed, \"was not perfectly sure that I am too honorable a gentleman to give Miss Camille the faintest hint of what he has said, sooner than say it he would go out and cut his throat from ear to ear.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well! you oughtn\u0027t to get mad at him for thinking you a gentleman.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He sha\u0027n\u0027t take a low advantage of my being one. You think he\u0027s open and blunt--he\u0027s as sly as a mink. He praises the older sister at the younger\u0027s expense, when it\u0027s the younger one that he\u0027s so everlastingly stuck on that he can\u0027t behave like a gentleman to any man to whom she shows the slightest preference.\" We heard a coming step, but I talked on: \"Sense! poor simpleton! he knows he hasn\u0027t got\"--the door opened and Harry stepped partly in, but I only raised my voice,--\"hasn\u0027t got as much brains in his whole head as there is in one of her tracks.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n With something between a sob, a sputter and a shriek he shut himself out again. Harry was never deep but in a shallow way, and never shallow without a certain treacherous depth. When Ned Ferry the next day summoned me to his bedside I went with a choking throat, not doubting I was to give account of this matter,--until I saw the kindness of his pallid face. Then my silly heart rose as much too high as it had just been too low and I thought \"Charlotte has surrendered!\" All he wanted was to make me his scribe. But when we were done he softly asked, \"That business of yours we talked about on the Plank-road--it looks any better?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n I bit my lip, turned away and shook my head. \"Well, anyhow,\" he said, \"I am told there is nobody in your way.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n I faced him sharply--\"Who told you that?\" and felt sure he would name the tricky aide-de-camp. But he pointed to the room overhead, which again, as in the other house, was Charlotte\u0027s. I blushed consciously with gratitude. \"Well,\" I said, \"it makes me happy to see you beginning again to get well.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Within the same hour I met unexpectedly two other persons. First, Harry Helm; who, before I could speak, was deluging me with words, telling me for the twentieth time how, on that evening of the indoor fight, coming with a platoon of Mississippians which he had procured merely as a guard, he was within a hundred yards of the house before our shots in the bedroom told him he was riding to a rescue. Then suddenly he began to assure me that in what he had said about the two sisters he had sought only to mislead the surgeon, who, he declared, was more utterly dead-gone on Camille than both of us put together. We parted, and within the next five minutes I confronted the maiden herself. \\n\\n \\n\\n She came from upstairs with a mixed armful of papers, books and sewing, said she had been with Charlotte, and said no more, only made a mysterious mouth. I inquired how Charlotte was. She shrugged, sank into a seat on the gallery, let her arm-load into her lap, and replied, \"Ah! she lies up there and smiles and smiles, and calls us pet names, and says she\u0027s perfectly contented, and then cannot drop half asleep without looking as though she were pressing a knife into her own heart. Oh, Dick, what is the matter with her?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What do you think,--Camille?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh--I--I\u0027m afraid to say it--even to Estelle, or aunt Martha, or--\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Say it to me,\" I murmured. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, if I could only trust you!\" she said, shaking her head sadly and trying to lift her arm\u0027s burden again without taking her eyes from mine. It went to her feet in a landslide, and out of one of the books fluttered three stems of sweet-pea each bearing two mated blossoms. I knew them in an instant, and in the next I had them. She would not let me pile the fallen freight anywhere but into her arm again, nor recover her eye before she was fully re-laden. Then she set her lips freezingly and said \"Now give me back my flowers.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n I meekly gave them and she turned to go into the house; her head gradually sank forward as she went, and her unparagoned ear and neck flushed to a burning red. On the threshold, by some miscalculation, her burdened arm struck the jamb, and the whole load fell again. I sprang and began to gather the stuff into a chair, but she walked straight on as though nothing had occurred, and shut the nearest door behind her. \\n\\n \\n\\n In those days used to come out to see us Gregory, in his long-skirted black coat and full civilian dress; of whom I have told a separate history elsewhere. Very pointed was Camille\u0027s neglect of both Harry and me, to make herself lovely to the dark and diffident new-comer, while Estelle positively pursued me with compensatory sweetness; and Gregory, whenever he and I were alone together, labored to reassure me of his harmlessness by expatiating exclusively upon the charms of Cécile. She seemed to him like a guardian angel of Ferry and Charlotte, while yet everything she said or did was wholly free from that quality of other-worldliness which was beautiful in Estelle, but which would not have endured repetition in the sister or the cousin. There Harry and I, also, once more agreed. Cécile never allowed herself to reflect a spirit of saintliness, or even of sacrifice, but only of maidenly wisdom and sweet philosophy. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If it weren\u0027t for Charlotte,\" whispered the Lieutenant, \"I could swear she was created for Ned Ferry!\" and when I shook my head he, too, declared \"No, no! if ever a match was made on high Charlotte was made for him and he for Charlotte; but, oh, Lord, Lord! Reach-hard Thorndyke Smith, how is this thing going to end?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n That was the problem in the mind of every looker on, and the lookers-on were legion; the whole wide neighborhood came to see us. Gregory and others outstayed their furloughs; the surgeon lingered shamelessly. Of course, there were three girls besides Charlotte, and it was pure lying--as I told Helm--for some of those fellows to pretend that Captain Ferry\u0027s problem was all they stayed for; and yet it was the one heart-problem which was everybody\u0027s, and we were all in one fever to see forthwith a conclusion which \"a decent respect to the opinions of mankind\" required should not come for months. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Pooh!\" said Harry, \"\u0027a decent respect to the opinions of mankind\u0027 requires just the reverse!\" and the surgeon avowed that it was required by a decent respect to her powers of endurance; he was every day afraid her slow improvement would stop and she would begin to sink. He admitted the event could wait, but he wished to gracious we could have her decision. \\n\\n \\n\\n I said suppose it should be negative. \"Oh, it won\u0027t!\" exclaimed both he and Harry. \"When it comes to the very point--\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Gregory\u0027s approach interrupted us, but I remembered a trait in Charlotte of which I have spoken, and gave myself the hope that their prediction might prove well founded. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2561/70572.html","bookId":414,"book":{"id":414,"title":"The Cavalier","description":"简介： Our camp was in the heart of Copiah County, Mississippi, a mile or so west of Gallatin and about six miles east of that once robber-haunted road, the Natchez Trace.
