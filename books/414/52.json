{"id":44081,"no":52,"title":"LII SAME BOOK AND LIGHT-HEAD HARRY","content":"The next day found me so robustly happy that I was allowed to dress and walk out to the front door. Three days later the surgeons were gone, all three, and at the approach of dew-fall Cécile and Harry, Camille and I, walked in a field-path, gathered hedge roses, and debated the problem of Mrs. Roy\u0027s daughter\u0027s book, which all of us were reading and none had finished. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"A woman,\" I remarked, \"who, for very love of a man, can say to him, \u0027Go on up the hill without me, I have a ball and chain on my foot and you shall not carry them and me, you have a race to run,\u0027--a woman so wonderfully good as to say that--\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ah, no!\" interrupted Cécile, with her killing Creole accent, \"not a woman so good to say that, only with the so-good sanse to say it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Harry was openly vexed. \"Well, either way! would any true man leave that woman behind?\" and I tried to put in that that was what I had been leading up to; but it makes me smile yet, to recall how jauntily she discomfited us both. She triumphed with the airy ease of a king-bird routing a crow in the upper blue. Camille had more than once told me that Cécile was wise beyond the hope of her two cousins to emulate her; which had only increased my admiration for Camille; yet now I began to see how the sisters came by their belief. In the present discussion she was easily first among the four of us. At the same time her sensuous graces also took unquestionable pre?minence; city-bred though she was, she had the guise of belonging to the landscape, or, rather, of the landscape\u0027s belonging, by some fairy prerogative, to her. She seemed just let loose into the world, yet as ready and swift to make right use of it as any humming-bird let into a garden; as untimorous as any such, and as elusive. In this sultry June air she had all the animation both of mind and of frame that might have been expected of her on a keen, clear winter day. Her face never bore the same expression at the beginning and middle, or at either of these and the close, of any of her speeches, yet every change was lovely, the sign of a happy play of feeling, and proof of a mercurial intelligence. No report of them by this untrained pen would fully bear me out, and the best tribute I can offer is to avoid the task. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was a sweet mercy in her to change the subject, and tactful to change it to Charlotte, as if Charlotte were quite an unrelated theme. The cousins vied with each other ever so prettily in telling how beautiful the patient was on her couch of enfeeblement and pain, how her former loveliness had increased, and what new nobility it had taken on. That any such problem overhung her life as that which we had just been weighing, seemed never to have entered their thought, and if they had ever conceived of a passion already conscious between Charlotte and Ferry, they veiled the fact with charming feminine art. \\n\\n \\n\\n When we got back to the house Harry detained me on the veranda alone. Camille told me how long I might tarry. It was heaven to have her bit in my mouth, and I found it hard to be grum even when Harry beat with his good hand the rhythm of \"Maiden passing fair, turn away thine eyes.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Dick,\" he said, suddenly grave as he walked me down the veranda, \"her cousin Cécile! isn\u0027t it awful? Now that poor girl\u0027s gone back to Ned\u0027s bedside; back to her torture! Why do they let her? My George! it\u0027s merciless! Has her aunt no eyes?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But, Lieutenant, you don\u0027t know she loves him; there are signs, I admit; but proofs, no. She\u0027s lost color, and her curves are more slender, but, my goodness! a dozen things might account for that.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Dick Smith,\"--my questioner worked himself up over the rail and sat out on the shelf that held the bucket of drinking-water and its gourd--\"do you imagine she didn\u0027t know, when we were talking about that book, that she was arguing against the union of Ned Ferry and Charlotte Oliver? Didn\u0027t she do it bravely! Richard, my friend, she couldn\u0027t have done it if she had suspected us of suspecting her. It\u0027s a bleeding pity! And yet you can\u0027t side with her, for I just swear Ned\u0027s got to have Charlotte Ol\u0027--what? No, he won\u0027t overhear a blank word; here\u0027s his window shut, right here. He\u0027s got to have her, I say, and he\u0027s got to have her just as soon as the two of \u0027em can stand up together to be sworn in! Don\u0027t you say so?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n I replied that I was not aware of any one who did not say so. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, I can name several! I don\u0027t call Scott Gholson anybody, but there\u0027s Major Harper--No, I\u0027m not talking too loud, Ned isn\u0027t hearing a word. Major Harper\u0027s so hot against this thing that he brought it up, with me, yesterday on the battlefield.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Major Harper doesn\u0027t really know her,\" I softly remarked. \\n\\n \\n\\n Harry swore with military energy. \"I told him he didn\u0027t, and he fairly snorted. We don\u0027t know her, he says; you nor I nor his sister nor his niece nor his daughters, oh, we don\u0027t know her at all; and neither do we know Ned; Ned has graceful manners, and she\u0027s a born actress, and we\u0027re simply infatuated by their romantic situation. Good Lordy! he got up on his Charleston pride-of-family like a circus-girl on stilts, and \u0027Edgard Ferry-Durand has got a great public career before him,\u0027 s\u0027s he, \u0027and no true friend will let him think of taking a wife who is all history and no antecedents, a blockade-runner, a spy, and the brand-new widow of a blackguard and a jayhawker she had run away from practically on her wedding-night.\u0027 Hy Jo\u0027! the way he went on, you\u0027d \u0027a\u0027 thought he was already Ned\u0027s uncle-in-l\u0027--\" The speaker\u0027s face took a sudden distress--\"Great Caesar!\" He pointed up to the second-story front room and slipped down from the shelf just as Estelle came out to us with her aunt\u0027s message for me to come in. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How\u0027s the fair patient?\" I hurried to ask as the three of us went. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why, Mr. Smith, she\u0027s actually been sitting up--in the twilight--at the open window--while Aunt Martha and I smoothed up her bed.\" Harry groaned. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"She\u0027s still very weak,\" said Aunt Martha when we came to her; \"the moment her bed was made up she asked to lie down again.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes,\" softly exclaimed Camille, \"but, oh, aunt Martha, with such courage in those eyes!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Smith,\" privately asked the agonized Harry, \"what would you do if you were in my place; go and cut your throat from ear to ear?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No,\" I said, as black as an executioner, \"but I wish you\u0027d done it yesterday.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2561/70568.html","bookId":414,"book":{"id":414,"title":"The Cavalier","description":"简介： Our camp was in the heart of Copiah County, Mississippi, a mile or so west of Gallatin and about six miles east of that once robber-haunted road, the Natchez Trace.
