{"id":44091,"no":62,"title":"LXII A TARRYING BRIDEGROOM","content":"Joyous was the dawn. With their places in the hospital filled for the brief time by Brookhaven friends, here were all our fairs, not to speak of the General, the Colonel, the Major, idlers of the town and region, and hospital bummers who had followed up unbidden and glaringly without wedding-garments. Cécile, Harry, Camille \"and others\" prepared the church. The General kept his tent, the Major rode to Hazlehurst, and the Colonel, bruised and stiffened by a late fall from his horse, lounged amiably just beyond talking range of the ladies and grumbled jokes to Chaplain Roly-poly, whose giggling enjoyment of them made us hope they were tempered to that clean-shaven lamb. However, there came a change. By mid-forenoon our gaiety ran on only by its momentum. The wedding was to be at eleven. At ten the Colonel, aside, told me, with a ferocious scowl, that my Captain ought to have arrived. At half-past he told me again, but Major Harper, returning from Hazlehurst, said, \"Oh, any of a hundred trifles might have delayed him a short time; he would be along.\" The wedding-hour passed, the wedding-feast filled the air with good smells. Horsemen ambled a few miles up the road and came back without tidings. Then a courier, one of Ferry\u0027s scouts, galloped up to the General\u0027s tent, and presently the Major walked from it to the tavern and up to Charlotte\u0027s room, to say that Ferry was only detained by Quinn\u0027s non-arrival. \"It\u0027s all right,\" said everyone. Another hour wore on, another followed. The General and old Dismukes played cards and the latter began to smell of his drams, Harry and Cécile walked and talked apart, Camille kept me in leash with three other men, and about two o\u0027clock came another courier with another bit of Ferry\u0027s writing; Quinn had returned. He had had a brush with jayhawkers in the night, had captured all but their leader, and had sent his prisoners in to brigade headquarters at union Church, while he returned to Ferry\u0027s camp bringing with him, mortally wounded--\"O--oh! Oh--oh!\" exclaimed Charlotte, gazing at the missive,--\"Sergeant Jim Langley!\" \"Does Ned say when he will start?\" asked the Colonel, and Charlotte, reading again, said the sergeant, at the time of the writing, was not expected to live an hour. Whereupon the word went through town that Ferry was on his way to us. \"Smith,\" said the Colonel, just not too full to keep up a majestic frown, \"want to saddle my horse and yours?\" and very soon we were off to meet the tardy bridegroom. The October sunshine was fiery, but the road led us through our old camp-ground for two or three shady miles before it forked to the right to cross the Natchez Trace, and to the left on its way to union Springs, and at the fork we halted. \"Smith, I reckon we\u0027d best go back.\" I mentioned his bruises and the torrid sun-glare before us, but he cursed both with equal contempt; \"No, but I must go back; I--I\u0027ve left a--oh, I must go back to wet my whistle!\" We had retraced our way but a few steps, when, looking behind me as a scout\u0027s habit is, I saw a horseman coming swiftly on the union Church road. \"Colonel,\" I said, \"here comes Scott Gholson.\" Without pausing or turning an eye my hearer poured out a slow flood of curses. \"If that whelp has come here of his own accord he\u0027s come for no good! Has he seen us?\" Gholson had not seen us; we had been in deep shade when he came into sight, and happened at that moment to turn an angle that took us out of his line of view. In a minute or so we were again at the small bridge over the embowered creek which ran through the camping-ground. The water was low and clear, and the Colonel turned from the bridge as if to cross beneath it and let his beast drink, yet motioned back for me to go upon it. As I reached its middle he came under it in the stream and halted. Guessing his wish I turned my horse across the bridge and waited. Gholson was almost within hail before he knew me. He was a heaving lump of dust, sweat and pain. \"Has Ned Ferry come?\" was his first call. I shook my head. \"Oh, thank God!\" he cried with a wild gesture and sank low in the saddle; but instantly he roused again: \"Oh, don\u0027t stop me, Smith; if I once stop I\u0027m afraid I\u0027ll never get to her!\" I stopped him. \"Why, Gholson, you\u0027re burning up with fever.\" \"Yes, I started with a shaking chill. I\u0027m afraid, every minute, I\u0027ll go out of my head. Oh, Smith, Oliver\u0027s alive! He\u0027s alive, he\u0027s alive, and I\u0027ve come to save his poor wife from a fate worse than death!\" \"Gholson, you are out of your head.\" \"Oh, yes, yes, yes! and yet I know what I\u0027m saying, I know what I\u0027m saying!\" \"You do not! Gholson, Oliver\u0027s been food for worms these four months. I know he wasn\u0027t dead at Gilmer\u0027s; but he died--now, let me tell you--he--\" \"Smith, I know the whole story and you know only half!\" \"No, no! I know all and you know only half; I have seen the absolute--\" \"Proofs? no! you saw things taken from the body of another man in Oliver\u0027s clothes! Oliver swapped places with him on the boat going down to the city so\u0027s he could come back to these parts without being hung by the Yankees; swapped with a sick soldier, one of a pair that wanted to desert; swapped names, clothes, bandages, letters, everything. It was that soldier that died of the congestive chill and was buried by your mother with his face in a blanket--as, like enough, mine will be before another day is done--Oh, Lord, Lord! my head will burst!\" \"Gholson, you\u0027re mistaken yet! That soldier came to my mother--\" \"No, he never! the other one went to her, in cahoots with Oliver, and worked the thing all through so\u0027s to have the news of Oliver\u0027s death, so called, come back here to the Yankees and us; and to his wife, so\u0027s she would marry Ned Ferry to her everlasting shame, and people would say they was served right when he killed \u0027em at last! O--oh! Smith,--\" \"Listen to me!\" I had tried twice to interrupt and now I yelled; \"was it Oliver, and a new gang, that Quinn fought last night, and have you got him at union Church?\" \"Quinn didn\u0027t know it, for Oliver got away, but they got the Yankee deserter, and brought him in when everybody was asleep but me, and I cross-examined him. Oh, my friend, God\u0027s arm is not shortened that he cannot save! He maketh the wrath of the wicked to praise him! The man was dying then, but thank God, I choked the whole truth out of him with a halter over a limb, and then for three mortal hours I couldn\u0027t start because the squad that took him out to--Who--who is that?\" The Colonel moved from under the bridge, spurred up the bank, and turned to us with a murderous smile. \"Howdy, Gholson.\" The smile grew. \"Had to stay with the hanging-squad to keep his mouth shut, you was going to say, wa\u0027n\u0027t you? But you knew Captain Ferry would be delayed waiting for Quinn, too; yes. Does any one know this now besides us three; no! Good, we\u0027re well met! Smith and me are going to union Church, and you\u0027d better go with us; I\u0027ve got a job that God A\u0027mighty just built you two saints and me for; come, never mind Gallatin, Ferry\u0027s not there, and when he gets there Heaven ain\u0027t a-going to stop that wedding, and hell sha\u0027n\u0027t.\" Gholson had barely caught his breath to demur when old Dismukes, roaring and snarling like a huge dog, whipped out his revolver, clutched the sick man\u0027s bosom, and hanging over him and bellowing blasphemies, yelled into his very teeth \"Come!\" We galloped. A courier from the brigade-camp met us, and the Colonel scribbled a purely false explanation of our absence, begging that no delay be made because of it. As the man left us, who should come up from behind us but Harry, asking what was the matter. \"Matter enough for you to come along,\" said the Arkansan, and we went two and two, he and Gholson, Harry and I. We reached camp at sundown, and stopped to feed and rest our horses and to catch an hour\u0027s sleep. Gholson\u0027s fatigue was pitiful, but he ate like a wolf, slept, and awoke with but little fever. The Colonel kept him under his eye, forcing on him the honors of his own board, bed and bottle, and at nine we galloped again. Between eleven and twelve the Colonel, Harry and I were in a dense wood, moving noiselessly toward a clearing brilliantly lighted by the moon. I was guide. A few rods back in the woods Gholson was holding our horses and with cocked revolver detaining a young mulatto woman from whom the Colonel had extorted the knowledge which had brought us to this spot. The clearing was fenced, but was full of autumn weeds. Near the two sides next us, tilted awry on its high basement pillars, loomed an old cotton-gin house, its dark shadows falling toward us. A few yards beyond towered and gleamed a white-boled sycamore, and between the two the titanic arms of the horse-power press widened broadly downward out of the still night sky. The tree was the one which old Lucius Oliver had once pointed out to me at dawn.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2561/70578.html","bookId":414,"book":{"id":414,"title":"The Cavalier","description":"简介： Our camp was in the heart of Copiah County, Mississippi, a mile or so west of Gallatin and about six miles east of that once robber-haunted road, the Natchez Trace.
