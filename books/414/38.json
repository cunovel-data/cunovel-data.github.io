{"id":44067,"no":38,"title":"XXXVIII \"BEAR A MESSAGE AND A TOKEN\"","content":"Late in the night Gholson came to the union captain\u0027s bedside for Miss Harper. Charlotte had sent him; the doctor had left word what to do if a certain patient\u0027s wound should re-open, and this had happened. The three had succeeded in stanching it, but Charlotte had prevailed upon Miss Harper to lie down, and the weary lady had, against all her intentions, fallen asleep. I was alone with the wounded captain. He did not really sleep, but under the weight of his narcotics drowsed, muttered, stirred, moaned, and now and then spoke out. \\n\\n \\n\\n Sitting in the open window, I marked the few red points of dying firelight grow fewer in the bivouac under the grove. Out there by the gate Ned Ferry slept. Fireflies blinked, and beyond the hazy fields rose the wasted moon, by the regal slowness of whose march I measured the passage of time as I had done two nights before. My vigil was a sad one, but, in health, in love, in the last of my teens and in the silent company of such a moon, my straying thoughts lingered most about the maiden who had \"prayed for me.\" My hopes grew mightily. Yet with them grew my sense of need to redouble a lover\u0027s diligence. I resolved never again to leave great gaps in my line of circumvallation about the city of my siege, as I had done in the past--two days. I should move to the final assault, now, at the earliest favorable moment, and the next should see the rose-red flag of surrender rise on her temples; in war it is white, but in love it is red. \\n\\n \\n\\n First favorable moment; ah! but when would that be? Who was to convey the Harpers to Hazlehurst? Well, thank Heaven! not Harry. Scott Gholson? Gholson was due at headquarters. Poor Gholson! much rest for racked nerves had he found here; what with Ferry, and Harry, and the fight, and Quinn, I wondered he did not lie down and die under the pure suffocation of his \"tchagrin.\" Even a crocodile, I believed, could suffer from chagrin, give him as many good causes as Gholson had accumulated. But no, the heaven of \"Charlie Tolliver\u0027s\" presence and commands--she seemed to have taken entire possession of him--lifted and sustained him above the clouds of all unkinder things. \\n\\n \\n\\n A faint stir at the threshold caught my ear and I discerned in the hall a young negro woman. The light of an unseen candle made her known at a glance; she had been here since the previous evening, as I knew, though it chanced that I had not seen her; Oliver\u0027s best wedding-gift, the slave maid whom I had seen with Charlotte in the curtained wagon at Gallatin. I stole out to her; she courtesied. \"Miss Charlotte say ef you want he\u0027p you fine me a-sett\u0027n\u0027 on de step o\u0027 de stairs hafe-ways down.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n I inquired if she was leaving us. \"She a-gitt\u0027n\u0027 ready, suh; Misteh Goshen done gone to de sta-able to git de hosses.\" The girl suddenly seemed pleased with herself. \"Mis\u0027 Charlotte would \u0027a\u0027 been done gone when de yethehs went--dem-ah two scouts what was sent ayfteh him--ef I hadn\u0027 spoke\u0027 up when I did.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Indeed! how was that?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why, I says, s\u0027 I, \u0027Mis\u0027 Charlotte, how we know he ain\u0027 gwine fo\u0027 to double on his huntehs? Betteh wait a spell, and den ef no word come back dat he a-doublin\u0027, you kin be sho\u0027 he done lit out fo\u0027 to jine de Yankees roun\u0027 Pote Hudsom.\u0027\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why did you tell her that? You want him caught; so do I; but you know she doesn\u0027t want to catch him, and you don\u0027t want her to. Neither do I. Nor neither do we want Lieutenant Ferry to catch him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, suh, dass so. But same time, while she no notion o\u0027 gitt\u0027n\u0027 him cotch, she believe she dess djuty-bound to head-off his devilment. \u0027Tis dess like I heah\u0027 Mr. Goshen say to Miss Hahpeh, \u0027Dis ain\u0027t ow own li\u0027l pri\u0027--\u0027\" \\n\\n \\n\\n I waved her away and went back into the room; the Captain had called. He asked the time of night; I said it was well after two; he murmured, was quiet, and after a moment spoke my name. I answered, and he whispered \"Coralie Rothvelt--she\u0027s here; I--recognized her voice--when they were singing. Did you know I knew her?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, Captain.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Daring game that was you fellows let her put up on us night before last, my boy,--and it hung by a thread. If our officers had only asked the old man his name--it would have been--a flash of light. If I had dreamed, when I saw--you and Ned Ferry--yesterday,--that Coralie Rothvelt was--Charlotte Oliver,--and could have known her then--as I\u0027ve--learned to know her--to-day--from her--worst enemy,--you know,--\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, Captain.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I should--have turned back, my boy.\" After a silence the hero said more to himself than to me \"Ah, if my brother were here to-night--I might live!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Many days afterward I thought myself dull not to have guessed what that speech meant, but now I was too distressed by the change I saw coming over him to do any surmising. He began to say things entirely to himself. \"Home!\" he murmured; \"sweet, sweet home!--my home! my country!--My God, my country, my home!--Smith,--you know what that is you\u0027re--wiping off my brow,--don\u0027t you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, Captain.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I--I didn\u0027t want you to be--taken too unpleasantly by surprise--just at the--end. You know what\u0027s--happening,--don\u0027t you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, Captain.\" As I wiped the brow again I heard the tread of two horses down in front of the house; they were Gholson\u0027s, and Ned Ferry\u0027s for Charlotte. \"Captain, may I go and bring her--tell her what you say, and bring her?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Do you think she\u0027d come? She\u0027d have gone to Ship Island if I had caught her.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I know she\u0027ll come.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I wish she would; she could \u0027bear a message and a token,\u0027 as the song says.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She came. I met her outside the door, and for a moment I feared she would come no farther. \"How can I, Richard! Oh, how can I?\" she whispered; \"this is my doing!\" But presently she stood at the bedside calm and compassionate, in the dark dress and limp hat of two nights before. The dying man\u0027s eyes were lustrous with gratitude. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I have one or two things,\" he said, after a few words of greeting, \"that I\u0027d like to send home--to my mother--and my wife; some trifles--and a message or two; if I--if--if I--\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Will you let me take them?\" Charlotte asked. I did not see or hear what they were; Gholson beckoned me into the hall. He did not whisper; there are some people, you know, who can never exercise enough self-suppression to whisper; he mumbled. He admitted the dying had some rights, but--he feared the delay might result unfortunately; wanted me to tell Charlotte so, and was sure I was ever so wrong to ask to have Ned Ferry awakened for the common incident of a prisoner\u0027s death; he would let him know the moment he awoke. \\n\\n \\n\\n When I came back into the room the captive had asked Charlotte to pray. \"Tisn\u0027t that I\u0027m--the least bit afraid,\" he was saying. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, no,\" she responded, wiping his brow, \"why should you be? Dying isn\u0027t nearly so fearful a thing as living. I\u0027d rather, now, you\u0027d pray for me; I\u0027m such an unbeliever--in the beliefs, I mean, the beliefs the church people think we can\u0027t get on without. My religion is scarcely anything but longings and strivings\"--she sadly smiled--\"longings and strivings and hopes.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yet you wouldn\u0027t--\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Part with it? Oh, not for the world beside!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Neither would I--with mine.\" The soldier folded his hands in supplication. \"Neither would I--though mine, O Lord--is only the--old-fashioned sort--for whose beliefs our fathers--used to kill one another; God have mercy--on them--and us.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n There was a great stillness. Against the bedside Charlotte had sunk to her knees, and under the broad brim of her Leghorn hat leaned her brow upon her folded hands. Thus, presently, she spoke again. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2561/70554.html","bookId":414,"book":{"id":414,"title":"The Cavalier","description":"简介： Our camp was in the heart of Copiah County, Mississippi, a mile or so west of Gallatin and about six miles east of that once robber-haunted road, the Natchez Trace.
