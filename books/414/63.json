{"id":44092,"no":63,"title":"LXIII SOMETHING I HAVE NEVER TOLD TILL NOW","content":"At the fence I ceased to lead, and we crept near the gin-house from three sides, warily, though all the chances were that wherever Oliver lay he was heavy with drink. The Colonel stole in alone. He was lost to us for, I should say, five minutes; they seemed thirty; then there pealed upon the stillness an uproarious laugh mingled with oaths and curses, sounds of a plunge, a struggle, a groan, and old Dismukes calling \"Come, boys, I\u0027ve got him! Take it easy, take it easy, I\u0027ve got him on the floor by the hair of his head; call Gholson!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Gholson brought the mulatress. In the feeble rays of an old tin lantern, on some gunny-sacking that lay about the gin-room floor, sat old Dismukes cross-legged and smiling, with arms folded and revolver dangling from his right hand, at full cock. On one side crouched Harry and I, on the other side Gholson and the slave woman. Facing him, half sat, half knelt Oliver, bound hand and foot, and gagged with his own knotted handkerchief. The lantern hung from a low beam just above his face; his eyes blazed across the short interval with the splendor of a hawk\u0027s. The dread issue of the hour seemed all at once to have taken from his outward aspect the baser signs of his habits and crimes, and I saw large extenuation for Charlotte\u0027s great mistake. From the big Colonel\u0027s face, too, the heaviness of drink was gone, and its smile grew almost fine as he spoke. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ten minutes for prayer is a good while to allow you, my amiable friend; we ain\u0027t heard for our much speaking, are we, Brother Gholson? Still, we\u0027ve given you that, and it\u0027s half gone. If you don\u0027t want the other half we won\u0027t force it on you; we\u0027ve got that wedding to go to, and I\u0027m afraid we\u0027ll be late.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The bound man sat like a statue. The slave girl went upon her knees and began to pray for her master,--with whom she had remained after every other servant on the place had run off to the Federals, supplicating with a piteous fervor that drew tears down Harry\u0027s cheeks. \"Humph!\" said the Arkansan, still smiling straight into Oliver\u0027s eyes, \"she\u0027d better be thanking God for her freedom, for that\u0027s what we\u0027re going to give her to-night; we\u0027re going to take her and your poor old crippled father to the outposts and turn \u0027em loose, and if either of \u0027em ever shows up inside our lines after to-night, we\u0027ll hang \u0027em. You fixed the date of your death last June, and we\u0027re not going to let it be changed; that\u0027s when you died. Ain\u0027t it, Gholson? Whoever says it ain\u0027t fixes the date of his own funeral, eh, boys? I take pleasure in telling you we\u0027re not going to hang your father, because I believe in my bones you\u0027d rather we\u0027d hang him than not. Mr. Gholson, you\u0027re our most pious believer in obedience to orders; well, I\u0027m going to give you one, and if you don\u0027t make a botch of it I sha\u0027n\u0027t have to make a botch of you; understand?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Gholson\u0027s lips moved inaudibly, his jaws set hard, and he blanched; but the Colonel smiled once more: \"I\u0027ve heard that at one time you said, or implied, that Captain Ferry had betrayed his office, because when he had a fair chance to shoot this varmint he omitted, for private reasons, to do it. And I\u0027ve heard you say, myself, that this isn\u0027t your own little private war. So,--just change seats with me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n They exchanged. The slave girl sank forward upon her face moaning and sobbing. Harry silently wept. \"Now, Gholson, you know me; draw--pistol.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Gholson drew; I grew sick. \"Ready,\"--Gholson came to a ready and so did the Colonel; \"aim,\" Gholson slowly aimed, the Colonel kept a ready, and Oliver, for the first time took his eyes from him and gazed at Gholson. \"Fire!\" Gholson fired; Oliver silently fell forward; with a stifled cry the girl sprang to him and drew his head into her lap, and he softly straightened out and was still. \"Oh, sweet Jesus!\" she cried, \"Oh, sweet Jesus!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The amused Colonel held the lantern close down. \"He\u0027s all right, Brother Gholson,\" was his verdict; the ball had gone to the heart. \"Still, just to clinch the thing, we\u0027ll calcine him, gin-house and all.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Gin-house and all, we burned him up. On our horses out in the open road to the house, we sat, the girl perched behind the Colonel, and watched the fire mount and whirl and crackle behind the awful black arms of the cotton-press. The Arkansan shook his head: \"It\u0027s too fine; \u0027tain\u0027t a dog\u0027s death, after all. Lord! why didn\u0027t I think of it in time? we\u0027d ought to \u0027a\u0027 just dropped him alive into that lint-box and turned the press down onto him with our horses!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n When the pile was in one great flame we rode to the dwelling, and the girl was sent in to bid old Lucius begone. The doors stood open, a soft firelight shone from his room. We saw her form darken his chamber threshold and halt, and then she wailed: \"Oh, Lawd God A\u0027mighty! Oh, Lawd God A\u0027mighty!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Stop that noise! Gholson, hold the horses. Come. Lieutenant, come Smith, maybe he\u0027s killed himself, but it seems too good to be true. Here, girl, go cram what you can get into a pillow-case, and mount behind my saddle again; be quick, we\u0027re going to burn this hornet\u0027s nest too.\" Harry and I had already run to the old man\u0027s room, and, sure enough, there lay the aged assassin hideous in his fallen bulk, with his own bullet in his brain. \\n\\n \\n\\n Once more the Arkansan shook his head at the leaping flames. \"Too good, too good for either of \u0027em, entirely; we\u0027ve let \u0027em settle at five cents on the dollar. Here girl,\"--he reached back and handed her a wad of greenbacks,--\"here\u0027s your dividend; you\u0027re a preferred creditor.\" He had rifled the pockets of both the dead men, and this was their contents. \"Now, boys, we\u0027ll dust, or we\u0027ll be getting shot at by some fool or other. We\u0027re leaving a fine horse hid away somewhere hereabouts, but we can\u0027t help that; come on.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n In due time the Colonel, with the slave girl, and Harry with her pillow-case of duds, turned toward Fayette, and Gholson and I toward the brigade, at union Church. Then, at last, my old friend and co-religionist let his wrath loose. He began with a flood of curses, lifting high a loaded carbine which we had found with Oliver and which he was ordered to turn in. As he gave his ecstasy utterance it grew; he brandished the weapon like a Bedouin, dug the rowels into his overspent beast and curbed him back to his haunches, fisted him about the ears, gnashed with the pain of his own blows, and howled, and stood up in the stirrups and cursed again. I had heard church-members curse, but they were new church-members, camp converts, and their curses were an infant\u0027s cooing, to this. Unwittingly he caused his horse to stumble, and the torrent of his passion gathered force like rain after a peal of thunder; he clubbed the gun to bring it down upon the beautiful creature\u0027s head, and when I caught it on the rise he wrenched it from me as if I were a girl, threw it fifty feet away, sprang to the ground and caught it up, fired it in the air, and with one blow against a tree sent the stock flying, threw the barrel underfoot, leapt upon it, tore his hair and his hat, and cursed and champed and howled. I sat holding his horse and feeling my satisfaction rise like the mercury in a warmed thermometer. Contrasting this mood with the cold malignancy and resolve of his temper in the soldiers\u0027 room at Sessions\u0027s, I saw, to my delight, that our secret was forever imprisoned in his breast, gagged and chained down by the iron of his own inextricable infamy. At dawn he awakened me that he might persuade me to reject the evidences brought against his character by his doings and endurings of the night, and that he might rebuild the old house of words in which habitually he found shelter, too abysmally self-conceited ever to see his own hypocrisy. We breakfasted with the \"attatchays\"; after which he had barely secured my final assurance that our friendship remained unmarred, when old Dismukes and Harry mounted at the Colonel\u0027s tent, and the old brute, as they trotted out into the Gallatin road, beckoned me to join them. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2561/70579.html","bookId":414,"book":{"id":414,"title":"The Cavalier","description":"简介： Our camp was in the heart of Copiah County, Mississippi, a mile or so west of Gallatin and about six miles east of that once robber-haunted road, the Natchez Trace.
