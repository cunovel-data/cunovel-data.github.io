{"id":44069,"no":40,"title":"XL HARRY LAUGHS","content":"The first hush of the deserted camp-ground was lost in the songs of returning birds. Captain Jewett, his majestic length blanket-bound from brow to heel as trimly as a bale, had been laid under ground, and the Harpers stood in prayer at the grave\u0027s head and foot with hats on for their journey. The burial squad, turned guard of honor to the dead captain of the Louisianians, were riding away on either side of a light wagon that bore his mortal part. I, after all, was to be the Harpers\u0027 guardian on their way. \n \n Day widened into its first perfection as we moved down the highroad toward a near fork whose right was to lead Harry and his solemn cortége southward, while the left should be our eastward course. Camille and I rode horseback, side by side, with no one near enough to smile at my sentimental laudations of the morning\u0027s splendors, or at her for repaying my eloquence with looks so full of tender worship, personal acceptance and self-bestowal, that to tell of them here would make as poor a show as to lift a sea-flower out of the sea; they call for piccolo notes and I am no musician. \n \n The familiar little leather-curtained wagon was just ahead of us, bearing the other three Harpers, the old negro driver and--to complete its overloading--his daughter, Charlotte\u0027s dark maid. Beside the wheels ambled and babbled Harry Helm. At the bridge he fell back to us and found us talking of Charlotte. Camille was telling me how well Charlotte knew the region south of us, and how her plan was to dine at mid-day with such a friend and to pass the night with such another; but the moment Harry came up she began to upbraid him in her mellowest flute-notes for not telling us that he had got his wound in saving-- \n \n \"Now, you ladies--\" cried the teased aide-de-camp, \"I--I didn\u0027t save Gholson\u0027s life! I didn\u0027t try to save it! I only tried to split a Yankee\u0027s head and didn\u0027t even do that! Dick Smith, if you tell anybody else that I saved--Well, who did, then? Good Lordy! if I\u0027d known that to save a man\u0027s life would make all this fuss I wouldn\u0027t \u0027a\u0027 done it! Why, Quinn and I had to sit and listen to Ned Ferry a solid half-hour last night, telling us the decent things he\u0027d known Gholson to do, and the allowances we\u0027d ought to make for a man with Gholson\u0027s sort of a conscience! And then, to cap--to clap--to clap the ki\u0027--to cap--the climax--consound that word, I never did know what it meant--to clap the climax, Ned sends for Gholson and gets Quinn to speak to him civilly--aw, haw, haw!--Quinn showing all the time how he hated the job, like a cat when you make him jump over a stick! And then he led us on, with just a word here and there, until we all agreed as smooth as glass, that all Quinn had said was my fault, and all I had done was Gholson\u0027s fault, and all Gholson had said or done or left undone was our fault, and the rest was partly Ned\u0027s fault, but mostly accident.\" \n \n Camille declared she did not and would not believe there had been any fault with any one, anywhere, and especially with Mr. Gholson, and I liked Lieutenant Helm less than ever, noticing anew the unaccountable freedom with which Camille seemed to think herself entitled to rebuke him. \"Oh, I\u0027m in your power,\" he cried to her, \"and I\u0027ll call him a spotless giraffe if you want me to! that\u0027s what he is; I\u0027ve always thought so!\" The spring-wagon was taking the left fork and he cantered ahead to begin his good-byes there and save her for the last. When he made his adieu to her he said, \"Won\u0027t you let Mr. Smith halt here with me a few moments? I want to speak of one or two matters that--\" \n \n She resigned me almost with scorn; which privately amused me, and, I felt sure, hoodwinked the aide-de-camp. \n \n \"Say, Dick!\" he began, as she moved away, \"look here, I\u0027m going to tell you something; Ned Ferry\u0027s in love with Charlotte Oliver!\" \n \n \"You don\u0027t mean it!\" \n \n \"Yes, I do, mean it! Smith, Ned\u0027s a grand fellow. I\u0027m glad I came here yesterday.\" \n \n \"Yes, you\u0027ve secured a furlough.\" \n \n \"Oh, this thing, yes; don\u0027t you wish you had it! No, I\u0027m glad I came, for what I\u0027ve learned. I\u0027m glad for what Ned Ferry has taught me a man can do, and keep from doing, when he\u0027s got the upper hold of himself. And I\u0027m glad for what she--you know who--by George! any man would know who ever saw her, for she draws every man who comes within her range, as naturally as a rose draws a bee. I\u0027m glad for what she has taught me a woman can be, and can keep from being, so long as she knows there\u0027s one real man to live up to! just up to, mind you, I don\u0027t even say to live for.\" \n \n I stared with surprise. Was this the trivial Harry talking? Fact is, the pair we were talking about had by some psychical magic rarified the atmosphere for all of us until half our notes were above our normal pitch. \n \n \"Do you mean she loves him; what sign of such a thing did she show yesterday or last evening?\" \n \n \"Not a sign of a sign! And yet I\u0027ll swear it! Do you know where she\u0027s gone?\" \n \n \"To-day? I think I do.\" \n \n \"Where?\" \n \n \"Well, Lieutenant, if I were she, I should go straight into the Yankee lines behind Port Hudson. She\u0027s got Jewett\u0027s messages and his sword, and the Yank\u0027s won\u0027t know her as a Confederate any better than they ever did; for it\u0027s only these men whom we\u0027ve captured who have found out she\u0027s Charlotte Oliver, or that she had any knowing part in General Austin\u0027s ruse.\" \n \n \"If Oliver doesn\u0027t tell,\" said Harry, lifting his bad hand in pain. \n \n \"He will not dare! If she can only get her word in first and tell them, herself, that he\u0027s Charlotte Oliver\u0027s husband and has just led the finest company of Federal scouts in the two States to destruction--\" \n \n \"Hi! that ought to cook his dough!--with her face--and her voice!\" \n \n \"Yes,\" I responded, \"--and his breath.\" \n \n \"And why do you think she wants to do this?\" asked Harry. \n \n \"She doesn\u0027t want to do it; but she feels she must, knowing that every blow he strikes from now on is struck on her account. I believe she\u0027s gone to warn the Yankees that his whole animus is personal revenge and that he will sacrifice anything or anybody, any principle or pledge or cause, at any moment, to wreak that private vengeance, in whole or in part.\" \n \n \"Dick Smith, yes! But don\u0027t you see, besides, what she does want? Why, she wants to keep Oliver and Ferry apart until somebody else for whom she doesn\u0027t care as she cares for Ned, say you, or I, or--or--\" \n \n \"Gholson?\" \n \n \"Gholson, no! she can\u0027t trust Gholson, Gholson\u0027s conscience is too vindictive; that\u0027s why she\u0027s keeping him with her as long as she can. No, but until some of us, I say, can give Oliver a thousand times better than he ought ever to get--except for her sake--\" \n \n \"Yes, you mean a soldier\u0027s clean death; and what you want of me is for me to say that I, for one, will lose no honest chance to give it to him, isn\u0027t it?\" \n \n \"What I want of you, Smith, is to tell you that I shall lose no such chance.\" \n \n \"Well, neither shall I.\" \n \n \"Bully for you, Dick; bully boy with the glass eye! You see, you\u0027re one of only half a dozen or so that know Oliver when they see him; so Ned will soon be sending you after him. Ned\u0027s got a conscience, too, you know, as squirmy as Gholson\u0027s. Oh, Lord! yes, you don\u0027t often see it, but it\u0027s as big and hard as a conscript\u0027s ague-cake.\" The Lieutenant gathered his rein; \"Smith, I want Ned and her to get one another; that\u0027s me!\" \n \n I was tempted to say it was me, too, but I forbore and only said it was I. \n \n \"All the same,\" said Harry, \"I\u0027m sorry for the little girl!\" \n \n \"Little girl?\" \n \n \"Oh, come, now, you know!\" He leaned to me and whispered, \"Miss Cécile!\" \n \n \"Lieutenant,\" I replied, with a flush, realizing what I owed to the family as a prospective member of it, \"you\u0027re mistaking a little patriotic ardor--\" \n \n \"Pat who--oh? I tell you, my covey,--and of course, you understand, I wouldn\u0027t breathe it any further--\" \n \n \"I\u0027d rather you would not.\" \n \n \"Phew-ew! I don\u0027t know why in the devil you\u0027d rather I would not, but--Smith,--she\u0027s so dead-gone in love with Ned Ferry, that if she doesn\u0027t get him--I George! it\u0027ll e\u0027en a\u0027most kill her!\" \n \n I guffawed in derision. \"And she didn\u0027t even have to tell you so! She can\u0027t even hide its deadly intensity from the casual bystander! haw! haw! haw! And it\u0027s all the outcome of a three-days acquaintance! It beats Doctor Swiftgrow\u0027s Mustache Invigor\u0027--aw, haw! haw!\" \"Oh, you think so? Pity you couldn\u0027t get a few barrels of it--aw, haw! haw!\" said Harry, and my laughter left off where his began. But, some way hurting his hand, he, too, stopped short. I drew my horse back. \n \n \"Is that all you\u0027ve noticed?\" I smilingly inquired. \"Isn\u0027t anybody else mortally in love with anybody else? You can\u0027t make me believe that\u0027s all you know!\" \n \n \"Well, then, I sha\u0027n\u0027t try. I do know one thing more; heard it yesterday. Like to hear it?\" \n \n \"Like! Why, I\u0027m just that dead-gone with curiosity that if I don\u0027t hear it it\u0027ll e\u0027en a\u0027most kill me--aw, haw! haw! haw!\" \n \n \"Well, I\u0027m tired saving people\u0027s lives, but we won\u0027t count this one; you say you want to hear it--I can\u0027t give you all of it but it begins: \n \n \"\u0027Turn away thine eyes, maiden passing fair! O maiden passing fair, turn away thine eyes!\u0027-- \n \n \"Haw! haw! haw! Good-bye, Smith,--aw, haw! haw! haw!--and it\u0027s all the outcome of a three-days acquaintance!--haw! haw! haw!--Oh, say!--Smith!\"--I was leaving him--\"that\u0027s right, go back and begin over!--\u0027Return! return!\u0027--aw, haw! haw! haw!\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2561/70556.html","bookId":414,"book":{"id":414,"title":"The Cavalier","description":"简介： Our camp was in the heart of Copiah County, Mississippi, a mile or so west of Gallatin and about six miles east of that once robber-haunted road, the Natchez Trace.
