{"id":44082,"no":53,"title":"LIII \"CAPTAIN, THEY\u0027VE GOT US\"","content":"More days slipped by. Neighbors pressed sweet favors upon us; calls, joyful rumors, delicacies, flowers. One day Major Harper paid us a flying visit, got kisses galore, and had his coat sponged and his buttons reanimated. In the small town some three miles northwest of us he was accumulating a great lot of captured stuff. On another day came General Austin and stayed a whole hour. Ferry took healing delight in these visits, asking no end of questions about the movements afield, and about the personal fortunes of everyone he knew. When the General told him Ferry\u0027s scouts were doing better without him than with him--\"I thought he would smile himself into three pieces,\" said the General at the supper-table. \\n\\n \\n\\n On a second call from Major Harper, when handed a document to open and read, he went through it carefully twice, and then dropping it on the coverlet asked--\"and Quinn?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, Quinn\u0027s turn will come.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ah! Major, that is not fair to Quinn!\" said Ferry. Yet when he took up the paper again he gazed on it with a happy gravity; it made him a captain. \"By the by,\" he said, \"that Yankee horse that Dick Smith captured at Sessions\u0027s; I\u0027d like to buy that horse from you, Major.\" They made the sale. \"And there\u0027s that captured ambulance still here, Major, with its team eating their heads off.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, I\u0027m going to take that away with me to-day.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n This meant that Charlotte\u0027s negro man and his daughter, her maid, had come with her spring-wagon, and Harry and I would have liked the Major better if he had smiled at this point, as he did not. Yet he was most lovable; sent so kind a message up to Charlotte that Harry and I wondered; and received back from her a reply so gracious that--since we could not wonder--we worshipped. In the evening of that day Ferry and Charlotte were transferred, she into the room behind her, and he upstairs into the one out of which she was taken. That night a slave and his wife, belonging to the place, ran away to the enemy. If they should tell the Yankees Ned Ferry was here--! \"By Jo\u0027!\" said Harry Helm, \"I\u0027m glad I didn\u0027t cut my throat; I told that darkey, yesterday, Ned\u0027s name was O\u0027Brien!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Toward the close of that day came tidings of the brigade\u0027s splendid work at a steamboat-landing on the Mississippi River, how they had stolen in by night between two great bodies of the enemy, burned a vast store of military supplies, and then brilliantly cut their way out; yet we were told to be ready to withdraw into Mississippi again as soon as our newly made captain could safely be moved. Pooh! what of that? Lee was on his way into Pennsylvania; the war was nearly over, sang the Harper girls, and we were the winners! They cheerily saw Helm and me, next morning, ride southward in search of further good news. At a cross-roads I proposed that we separate, and meet there again near the end of the day. He turned west; I went an hour\u0027s ride farther south and then turned west myself. \\n\\n \\n\\n When we met again I knew that he--while he did not know that I--had been to Gilmer\u0027s plantation. We wanted to see if the Federals had left a grave there. They had left three, and a young girl who had been one of the dancers told me she had seen Oliver\u0027s body carried off by two blue troopers who growled and cursed because they had been sent back to bury it. Neither Harry nor I mentioned the subject when we met at the cross-roads again, for we came on our horses\u0027 necks at a stretched out run; the Federals were rolling up from the south battalion after battalion, hoping to find Major Harper\u0027s store of supplies feebly guarded and even up with us for that steamboat-landing raid. Presently as we hurried northward we began to hear, off ahead of us on our left, the faint hot give-and-take of two skirmish lines. We came into the homestead grove at a constrained trot and found the ladies out on the veranda in liveliest suspense between scepticism and alarm. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, they\u0027re fighting, now, on the edge of town,\" we said, \"but our boys will keep them there.\" Our host and hostess moaned their unbelief. \"However,\" added Harry, \"I\u0027ll go tell the old man to hitch up the little mules and--\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You dawn\u0027t need,\" said Cécile, \"\u0027tis done!\" and Camille confirmed her word, while the planter and his wife returned to the kitchen yard, where the servants were loading the smokehouse meat into a wagon to hide it in the woods; Miss Harper and Estelle went into the house, summoned by Charlotte\u0027s maid. On Ferry\u0027s chamber floor sounded three measured thumps of his scabbarded sword. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Dick, you answer that,\" exclaimed Harry, reining in half wheeled; \"but keep him on his back, if you have to hold him down!\" He spurred away to learn whether we had better stay or fly. I threw my rein to Camille and flew up the hall stairs. \\n\\n \\n\\n Ferry lay in bed with three pillows behind him and his sheathed sword across his lap. \"Good-evening, Richard,\" he said, \"you are returned just in time; will you please hand me my two pistol\u0027 from yonder?--thank you.\" He laid one beside each thigh. \"Now please turn the head of my bed a little bit, to face the door--thank you; and now, good-bye. You hear those footstep\u0027 there in the room behind? she is dressing to go; the other ladies they are helping her. Richard, I place them in your charge; have them all ready to get into her wagon at a moment\u0027s notice, with you on your horse--and you better take that Jewett horse, too; he came to-day.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n I hesitated, but a single flash of authority from his eye was enough and I had passed half-way to the door, when, through the window over the front veranda, I saw a small body of horsemen trotting up through the grove. The dusk of the room hid me, but there was no mistaking them. \"Too late, Captain,\" I said, \"they\u0027ve got us.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How many do you see?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"About sixteen. Our two horses will be Yankees again to-morrow.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ah! not certainly. Where is your carbine?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Just outside this door. They know you\u0027re here, Captain, they\u0027re surrounding the house.\" As I reached toward the door I heard his sword crawl out, the doorknob clicked without my touching it, the door swung and closed again, and Charlotte Oliver was with us. The light of the western window shone full upon her; she was in the same dress, hat and all, in which I had seen her the night we rode together alone. Though wasted and pale, she betrayed a flush on either cheek and a smile that mated with the sweet earnest of her eyes. She tendered me my carbine, patted my hand caressingly, and glided onward to Ferry\u0027s bedside. With my back to them and my ear to the door I hearkened outward. In the front doorway below sounded the jingling tread of cavalry-boots and a clank of sabres. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2561/70569.html","bookId":414,"book":{"id":414,"title":"The Cavalier","description":"简介： Our camp was in the heart of Copiah County, Mississippi, a mile or so west of Gallatin and about six miles east of that once robber-haunted road, the Natchez Trace.
