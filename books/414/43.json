I wondered who could be so favored by the enemy and yet be so devoted to our cause as to signal us from his window with their sentinels at his doors; and as we passed beyond the cornfield\u0027s farther fence I ventured to ask Ferry. \n \n \"Aaron Goldschmidt,\" he whispered, as we descended into a dry, tangled swamp. In the depths of this wild, beside a roofed pen of logs stored with half a dozen bales of cotton, we were presently in the company of a very small man who tossed a hand in token of great amusement. \n \n \"Hello, Ned!\" he whispered in antic irony; \"what an accident is dat, meeding so! Whoever is expecting someding like dis!\" \n \n \"Well, I hope nobody, Isidore; I hardly expected it myself, your father set those candles so close the one behind the other.\" \n \n Isidore doubled with mirth and as suddenly straightened. \"Your horse is here since yesterday. She left him--by my father. She didn\u0027t t\u0027ink t\u0027e Yankees is going to push away out here to-night. But he is a pusher, t\u0027at Grierson! You want him to-night, t\u0027at horse? He is here by me, but I t\u0027ink you best not take him, hmm? To cross t\u0027e creek and go round t\u0027e ot\u0027er way take you more as all night; and to go back t\u0027is same way you come, even if I wrap him up in piece paper you haven\u0027t got a lawch insite pocket you can carry him?\" He laughed silently and the next instant was more in earnest than ever. \n \n \"She is in a tight place! She hires my mother\u0027s pony to ride in to headquarters.\" He called them hatekvartuss, but we need not. \"I t\u0027ink she is not a prisoner--unless--she wants to come back.\" He doubled again. \"Anyhow, I wish you can see her to-night; she got another doll-baby for t\u0027e gildren, and she give you waluable informations by de hatfull.... Find her? I tell you how you find her in finfty-nine minutes--vedder permitting, t\u0027at is.\" \n \n The last phrase was fitted to a listening pose, and the first mutter of the pending thunder-storm came out of the northwest. Then Isidore hastened through the practical details of his proposition. Ferry drew a breath of enthusiasm. \"Can I have my horse, bridled and saddled, in three minutes?\" \n \n \"I pring um in two!\" said Isidore, and vanished. Ferry turned with an overmastering joy in every note of his whispered utterance. \"After all!\" he said, and I could have thrown my arms around him in pure delight to hear duty and heart\u0027s desire striking twelve together. \n \n \"Smith,\" he asked, \"can you start back without me? Then go at once; I shall overtake you on my horse.\" \n \n I stole through the cornfield safely; the frequent lightnings were still so well below the zenith as to hide me in a broad confusion of monstrous shadows. But when I came to cross the road no crouching or gliding would do. I must go erect and only at the speed of some ordinary official errand. So I did, at a point between two opposite fence-gaps, closely after an electric gleam, and I was rejoicing in the thick darkness that followed, when all at once the whole landscape shone like day and I stood in the middle of the road, in point-blank view of a small squad, a \"visiting patrol\". They were trotting toward me in the highway, hardly a hundred yards off. As the darkness came again and the thunder crashed like falling timbers, I started into the cotton-field at an easy double-quick. The hoofs of one horse quickened to a gallop. A strong wind swept over, big rain-drops tapped me on the shoulder and pattered on the cotton-plants, the sound of the horse\u0027s galloping ceased as he turned after me in the soft field, and presently came the quiet call \"Halt, there, you on foot.\" I went faster. I knew by my pursuer\u0027s coming alone that he did not take me for a Confederate, and that the worst I should get, to begin with, would be the flat of his sabre. Shrewdly loading my tongue with that hard northern r which I hated more than all unrighteousness, I called back \"Oh, I\u0027m under orders! go halt some fool who\u0027s got time to halt!\" \n \n I obliqued as if bound for the headquarters fire where we had seen the singers, the lightning branched over the black sky like tree-roots, the thunder crashed and pounded again, the wind stopped in mid-career, and the rain came straight down in sheets. \"Halt!\" yelled the horseman. He lifted his blade, but I darted aside and doubled, and as he whirled around after me, another rider, meeting him and reining in at such close quarters that the mud flew over all three of us, lifted his hand and said-- \n \n \"He is right, sergeant, he is carrying out my orders.\" Ferry\u0027s black silk handkerchief about his neck covered his Confederate bars of rank, and the Federal may or may not have noted the absence of shoulder-straps; our arms remained undrawn; and so the sergeant, catching a breath or two of disconcertion, caught nothing else. While Ferry spoke on for another instant I showed my heels; then he left the dripping Yankee mouthing an angry question and loped after me, and over the low fence went the two of us almost together. \n \n Kendall was not there, the Federal camp-makers had tardily repaired their blunder by posting guards; but these were not looking for their enemies from the side of their own camp, and as we cleared the fence in the full blaze of a lightning flash, only two or three wild shots sang after us. In the black downpour Ferry reached me an invisible hand. I leapt astride his horse\u0027s croup, and trusting the good beast to pick his way among the trees himself, we sped away. Soon we came upon our three men waiting with the horses, and no great while afterward the five of us rejoined our command. The storm lulled to mild glimmerings and a gentle shower, and the whole company, in one long single file, began to sweep hurriedly, stealthily, and on a wide circuit of obscurest byways, deeper than ever into the enemy\u0027s lines. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2561/70559.html","bookId":414,"book":{"id":414,"title":"The Cavalier","description":"简介： Our camp was in the heart of Copiah County, Mississippi, a mile or so west of Gallatin and about six miles east of that once robber-haunted road, the Natchez Trace.
