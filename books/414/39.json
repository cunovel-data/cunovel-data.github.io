{"id":44068,"no":39,"title":"XXXIX CHARLOTTE SINGS","content":"\"I know, Captain,\" she said, \"that we can\u0027t have longings, strivings, or hopes, without beliefs; beliefs are what they live on. I believe in being strong and sweet and true for the pure sake of being so; and yet more for the world\u0027s sake; and as much more again for God\u0027s sake as God is greater than his works. I believe in beauty and in joy. I believe they are the goal of all goodness and of all God\u0027s work and wish. As to resurrection, punishment, and reward, I can\u0027t see what my noblest choice has to do with them; they seem to me to be God\u0027s part of the matter; mine is to love perfect beauty and perfect joy, both in and infinitely beyond myself, with the desiring love with which I rejoice to believe God loves them, and to pity the lack of them with the loving pity with which God pities it. And above all I believe that no beauty and no joy can be perfect apart from a love that loves the whole world\u0027s joy better than any separate joy of any separate soul.\" \"Thank you,\" was murmured from the pillow. Then, as Charlotte once more wiped the damp brow, the captive said, with much labor, \"After that--war seems--an awful thing. I suppose it isn\u0027t half so much a crime--as it is a--penalty--for the crimes that bring it on. But anyhow--you know--being--\" The bugle rang out the reveillé. \"Being a soldier,\" said Charlotte, \"you want to die like one?\" \"Yes, oh, yes!--the best I can. I\u0027d like to sit half up--and hold my sword--if there\u0027s--no objection. I\u0027ve loved it so! It would almost be like holding--the hand that\u0027s far away. Of course, it isn\u0027t really necessary, but--it would be more like--dying--for my country.\" He would not have it in the scabbard, and when I laid it naked in his hand he kissed the hilt. Charlotte sent Gholson for Ned Ferry. Glancing from the window, I noticed that for some better convenience our scouts had left the grove, and the prisoners had been marched in and huddled close to the veranda-steps, under their heavy marching-guard of Louisianians. One of the blue-coats called up to me softly: \"Dying--really?\" He turned to his fellows--\"Boys, Captain\u0027s dying.\" Every Northern eye was lifted to the window and I turned away. \"Richard!\" gently called Charlotte, and I saw the end was at hand; a new anguish was on the brow; yet the soldier was asking for a song; \"a soldier\u0027s song, will you?\" \"Why, Captain,\" she replied, \"you know, we don\u0027t sing the same words to our soldier-songs that you do--except in the hymns. Shall I sing \u0027Am I a soldier of the cross?\u0027\" He did not answer promptly; but when he did he said \"Yes--sing that.\" She sang it. As the second stanza was begun we heard a responsive swell grow softly to fuller and fuller volume beneath the windows; the prisoners were singing. I heard an austere voice forbid it, but it rose straight on from strength to strength: \"Sure I must fight if I would win, Increase my courage, Lord. I\u0027ll bear the toil, endure the pain, Supported by thy word.\" The dying man lifted a hand and Charlotte ceased. He had not heard the muffled chorus of his followers below; or it may be that he had, and that the degree of liberty they seemed to be enjoying prompted him to seek the new favor he now asked. I did not catch his words, but Charlotte heard, and answered tenderly, yet with a thrill of pain so keen she could not conceal it even from him. \"Oh! you wouldn\u0027t ask a rebel to sing that,\" she sighed, \"would you?\" He made no rejoinder except that his eyes were insistent. She wiped his temples. \"I hate to refuse you.\" His gaze was grateful. She spoke again: \"I suppose I oughtn\u0027t to mind it.\" Miss Harper came in, and Charlotte, taking her hand without a glance, told the Captain\u0027s hard request under her voice. Miss Harper, too, in her turn, gave a start of pain, but when the dying eyes and smile turned pleadingly to her she said, \"Why, if you can, Charlotte, dear, but oh! how can you?\" Charlotte addressed the wounded man: \"Just a little bit of it, will that do?\" and as he eagerly assented she added, to Miss Harper, \"You know, dear, in its history it\u0027s no more theirs than ours.\" \"No, not so much,\" said Miss Harper, with a gleam of pride; and thereupon it was my amazement to hear Charlotte begin guardedly to sing: \"O say, can you see, by the dawn\u0027s early light, What so proudly we hailed at the twilight\u0027s last gleaming?\" But guardedly as she began, the effect on the huddled crowd below was instant and electrical. They heard almost the first note; looking down anxiously, I saw the wonder and enthusiasm pass from man to man. They heard the first two lines in awed, ecstatic silence; but at the third, warily, first one, then three, then a dozen, then a score, bereft of arms, standard, and leader, little counting ever again to see freedom, flag, or home, they raised their voices, by the dawn\u0027s early light, in their song of songs. Our main body were out in the highway, just facing into column, and the effect on them I could not see. The prisoners\u0027 guards, though instantly ablaze with indignation, were so taken by surprise that for two or three seconds, with carbines at a ready, they--and even their sergeant in command--only darted fierce looks here and there and up at me. The prisoners must have been used to singing in ordered chorus, for one of them strode into their middle, and smiling sturdily at the maddened guard and me, led the song evenly. \"No, sir!\" he cried, as I made an angry sign for them to desist, \"one verse through, if every damned fool of us dies for it--let the Captain hear it boys--sing! \"\u0027The rockets\u0027 red glare, the bombs bursting in air--\u0027\" Charlotte had ceased, in consternation not for the conditions without more than for those within. With the first strong swell of the song from below, the dying leader strove to sit upright and to lift his blade, but failed and would have slammed back upon the pillows had not she and Miss Harper saved him. He lay in their arms gasping his last, yet clutching his sabre with a quivering hand and listening on with rapt face untroubled by the fiery tumult of cries that broke into and over the strain. \"Club that man over the head!\" cried the sergeant of the guard, and one of his men swung a gun; but the Yankee sprang inside of its sweep, crying, \"Sing her through, boys!\" grappled his opponent, and hurled him back. In the same instant the sergeant called steadily, \"Guard, ready--aim--\" There sounded a clean slap of levelled carbines, yet from the prisoners came the continued song in its closing couplet: \"The star-spangled banner! O, long may it wave!--\" and out of the midst of its swell the oaths and curses and defiant laughter of a dozen men crying, with tears in their eyes, \"Shoot! shoot! why don\u0027t you shoot?\" But the command to fire did not come; suddenly there was a drumming of hoofs, then their abrupt stoppage, and the voice of a vigilant commander called, \"Attention!\" With a few words to the sergeant, more brief than harsh, and while the indomitable singers pressed on to the very close of the stanza without a sign from him to desist, Ferry bade the subaltern resume his command, and turned toward me at the window. He lifted his sword and spoke in a lowered tone, the sullen guard stood to their arms, and every captive looked up for my reply. \"Shall I come?\" he inquired; but I shook my head. \"What!--gone?\" he asked again, and I nodded. He turned and trotted lightly after the departing column. I remember his pensive mien as he moved down the grove, and how a soft gleam flashed from his sword, above his head, as with the hand that held it he fingered his slender mustache, and how another gleam followed it as he reversed the blade and let it into its sheath. Then my eyes lost him; for Gholson had taken his place under the window and was beckoning for my attention. \"Is she coming?\" he called up, and Charlotte, at my side, spoke downward: \"I shall be with you in a moment.\" While he waited the second lieutenant of the Louisianians came, and as guard and prisoners started away she came out upon the veranda steps. Across her knee, as she and Gholson galloped off by a road across fields, lay in a wrapping of corn-husks the huge sabre of the dead northerner.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2561/70555.html","bookId":414,"book":{"id":414,"title":"The Cavalier","description":"简介： Our camp was in the heart of Copiah County, Mississippi, a mile or so west of Gallatin and about six miles east of that once robber-haunted road, the Natchez Trace.
