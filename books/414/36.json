{"id":44065,"no":36,"title":"XXXVI \"SAYS QUINN, S\u0027E\"","content":"Lieutenant Helm came out as I went in, and I paused an instant to ask him in fierce suspicion if he had bandaged his hand himself. \"No,\" he whispered, \"Miss Camille.\" It was a lie, but I did not learn that until months after. \"Come downstairs as soon as you can,\" he added, \"there\u0027s a hot supper down there; first come first served.\" We parted. I found Miss Harper fanning the wounded giant and bathing his brows, and my smiles were ample explanation of my act as I hung the sword up. Then I brought in my leader. \"Captain Jewett,\" he said after a nearly silent exchange of greetings, \"I wish we had you uninjured.\" \"Ah, no, Lieutenant, this is bad enough. Lieutenant, there is one matter--\" \"Yes, Captain, what is that?\" \"The villain who set those fires--you know who he is, I hope.\" \"Yes, Captain, I know.\" \"He didn\u0027t begin that until after he left me. I had some private reasons for not killing him when I might have done it.\" \"Yes, Captain, I know that, too.\" \"Yet if I had caught him again I would have strung him up to the first limb.\" \"I have sent some picked men to catch him if they can,\" said Ferry, and the racked sufferer lifted a hand in approval. Camille came to her aunt and whispered \"Mr. Gholson with two doctors.\" The wounded captive heard her. \"Lieutenant,\" he panted, \"I hope you\u0027ll--do me the favor--to let my turn with those gentlemen--come last,--after my boys,--will you?\" \"Ah! Captain, even our boys wouldn\u0027t allow that; no, here\u0027s a doctor, now.\" I went down to the supper-table. Camille was there, dispensing its promiscuous hospitality to men who ate like pigs. I would as leave have found her behind a French-market coffee-stand. Harry Helm, nursing his bandaged hand, was lolling back from the board and quizzing her with compliments while she cut up his food. A fellow in the chair next mine said he had seen me with Ferry when we joined the Louisianians\u0027 charge. \"Your aide-de-camp friend over yonder\u0027s a-gitt\u0027n\u0027 lots o\u0027 sweetenin\u0027 with his grub; well, he deserves it.\" I asked how he deserved it. \"Why, we wouldn\u0027t \u0027a\u0027 got here in time if he hadn\u0027t \u0027a\u0027 met-up with us. That man Gholson, he\u0027s another good one.\" The latter remark seemed to me a feeler, and I ignored it, and inquired how Lieutenant Helm had got that furlough. (Furlough was our slang for a light wound.) \"Oh, he got it mighty fair! Did you see that Yankee lieutenant with the big sabre-cut on his shoulder? Well, your friend yonder gave him that--and got the Yankee\u0027s pistol-shot in his hand. But that saved Gholson\u0027s life, for that shot was aimed to give Gholson a furlough to kingdom-come. Are they kinfolks?\" I mumbled that they were not even friends. \"Well, now, I suspicioned that,--when I first see \u0027em meet at the head of our column! But the aide-de-camp he took it so good-natured that, thinks I,--\" Another of Ferry\u0027s men, seated opposite, swallowed hurriedly, and covertly put in--\"Y\u0027 ought to hear what Quinn said to Gholson just now as they met-up out here in the hall. Quinn thought they were alone. Says Quinn, as cold as a fish, s\u0027s\u0027e \u0027Mr. Gholson,\u0027 s\u0027e, \u0027you\u0027re not a coward, sir, and that\u0027s why I\u0027m curious to ask you a question,\u0027 s\u0027e. And says Gholson, just as cold, s\u0027e \u0027I\u0027m prepared, Lieutenant Quinn, to answer it.\u0027 And says Quinn, s\u0027e \u0027Why was it, that when Harry Helm struck that blow which saved your life, and which you knew was meant to save it, and you seen his sword shot out of his hand and three or four Yankees makin\u0027 a dead set to kill him, and nothin\u0027 else in any particular danger at all, why was it, Mr. Gholson, that you never turned a hand nor an eye to save him?\u0027\" \"Great Scott! wha\u0027d Gholson say?\" \"Gholson, s\u0027e, \u0027I done as I done, sir, from my highest sense o\u0027 duty. This ain\u0027t Lieutenant Helm\u0027s own little private war, Lieutenant Quinn, nor mine, nor yours.\u0027\" \"Jo\u0027! that to Quinn! wha\u0027d Quinn answer?\" \"Why, with that Quinn popped them big glass eyes o\u0027 his\u0027n till the whites showed clear round the blue, and s\u0027e \u0027I know it better than you do; that\u0027s just what it suited you to forget. Oh! I\u0027d already seen through you in one flash, you sneak. It\u0027s good for you you\u0027re not in my command; I\u0027d lift you to a higher sense of whose war this is, damn you, if I had to hang you up by the thumbs.\u0027 With that he started right on by, Gholson a-keepin\u0027 his face to him as he passed, when Ned Ferry and--her--came out o\u0027 the parlor, and Ned turned out on the rear gallery with Quinn while she sort o\u0027 smiled at Gholson to come to her and sent him off on some business or other. George! I never seen her so beautiful.\" Thereupon occurred a brief exchange of comments which seemed to me to carry by implication as fine a praise as could possibly come from two rough fellows of the camp. Speaking the names of Ferry and Charlotte in undertone, of course, but with the unrestraint of soldiers, they said their say without a shadow of inuendo in word or smile. Her presence, they agreed, always made them feel as though something out of the common \"was bound to happen pretty quick,\" while his, they said, assured them that \"whatever did happen would happen right.\" I turned with a frown as Harry laughed irrelevantly, and saw Camille and him smiling at me with childish playfulness. Then suddenly their smile changed and went beyond me, two or three men softly said \"Smith!\" and I was out of my chair and standing when Charlotte Oliver, in a low voice, tenderly accosted me. \"Oh, Richard Thorndyke Smith!--alive and well! Lieutenant Ferry wants you; he has just gone to his camp-fire.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2561/70552.html","bookId":414,"book":{"id":414,"title":"The Cavalier","description":"简介： Our camp was in the heart of Copiah County, Mississippi, a mile or so west of Gallatin and about six miles east of that once robber-haunted road, the Natchez Trace.
