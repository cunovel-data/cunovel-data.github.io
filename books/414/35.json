{"id":44064,"no":35,"title":"XXXV FALLEN HEROES","content":"I dropped to my knee in the reddening pool and passed my arm under his head. \"Thank you,\" he said, and repeated the word as I wet my handkerchief and wiped the mire from his face; \"thank you;--no, no,\"--I was opening his shirt--\"that\u0027s useless; get me where you can turn me over; you\u0027ve hit me in the back, my lad.\" \"I?--I hit you? Oh, Captain Jewett, thank God, I didn\u0027t hit you at all!\" \"What\u0027s the difference, boy; you didn\u0027t aim to miss, did you? I didn\u0027t. It\u0027s not my only hurt; I think I broke something inside when I fell from the sad\u0027--ah! that\u0027s your bugle, isn\u0027t it? It\u0027s my last fight--oh, the devil! my good boy, don\u0027t begin to cry again; war\u0027s war; give me some water.... Thank you! And now, if you don\u0027t want me to bleed to death get me out of this slop, and--yes,--easy!--that\u0027s it--easy--oh, God! oh, let me down, boy, let me down, you\u0027re killing me! Oh!--\" he fainted away. With his unconscious head still on my arm I faced toward the hundred after-sounds of the fray and hallooed for help. To my surprise it promptly came. Three blundering boys we were who lifted him into the saddle and bore him to the house reeling and moaning astride of Cricket, the poor beast half dead with hard going. The sinking sun was as red as October when we issued into the highroad and moved up it to the grove gate through the bloody wreckage of the fray. The Louisianians were camping in the woods-pasture, Ferry\u0027s scouts in the grove, and the captive Federals were in the road between, shut in by heavy guards. At our appearance they crowded around us, greeting their undone commander with proud words of sympathy and love, and he thanked them as proudly and lovingly, though he could scarcely speak, more than to ask every moment for water. A number of our Sessions house group crowded out to meet us at the veranda steps; Camille; Harry Helm with his right hand bandaged; Cécile, attended by two or three Sessions children; and behind all Miss Harper exclaiming \"Ah, my boy, you\u0027re a welcome sight--Oh! is that Captain Jewett!\" Two or three bystanders helped us bear him upstairs, where, turning from the bedside, I pressed Camille with eager questions. \"Lieutenant Ferry? he\u0027s unhurt--and so is Mr. Gholson! Mr. Gholson\u0027s gone to Franklin for doctors; Lieutenant Ferry sent him; he\u0027s been sending everybody everywhere faster than anybody else could think of anything!\" I asked where Ferry was now. Her eyes refilled--they were red from earlier distresses--and she motioned across the hall: \"The captain of the Louisianians, you know, has sent for him!\" \"Yes,\" I said, \"the Captain\u0027s hit hard. I saw him when he was struck.\" \"Oh, Dick! then you were at the very front!\" \"Did you think I was at the rear?\" She looked down. \"I couldn\u0027t help hoping it.\" \"Then you were thinking of me.\" \"I prayed for you.\" Such news seemed but ill-gotten gains, to come before I had gathered courage to inquire after Charlotte Oliver. \"Wh\u0027--where is--where are the others?\" \"They\u0027re all about the house, tending the wounded; Mrs. Sessions is with the Squire, of course,--dear, brave old gentleman! we thought he was killed, but Charlotte found the ball had glanced.\" I asked if it was Oliver who shot him, and she nodded. \"It was down at the front door; the Squire said he\u0027d shoot him if he shot Charlotte, and Charlotte declared she\u0027d shoot him if he shot the Squire, and all at once he shot at her and struck him.\" \"Who was it that screamed; was it she?\" My informant\u0027s head drooped low and she murmured, \"It was I.\" \"Then you were at the front.\" \"Did you think I was at the rear?\" I fear I answered evasively. I added that I must go to Lieutenant Ferry, and started toward the door, but she touched my arm. \"Oh, Dick, you should have heard him praise you to her!--and when he said you had chased Captain Jewett and was missing, she cried; but now I\u0027ll tell her you\u0027re here.\" She started away but returned. \"Oh, Dick, isn\u0027t it wonderful how we\u0027re always victorious! why don\u0027t those poor Yankees give up the struggle? they must see that God is on our side!\" As she left me, Ned Ferry came out with a sad face, but smiled gladly on me and caught me fondly by the arm. On hearing my brief report he saddened more than ever, and when I said I had promised Jewett he should hand his sword to none but him, \"Oh!\"--he smiled tenderly--\"I don\u0027t want to refuse it; go in and hang it at the head of his bed as he would do in his own tent; I\u0027ll wait here.\" I pointed to the door he had softly closed behind him: \"How is it in there?\" \"Ah, Richard, in there the war is all over.\" \"Dead?\" \"So called.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2561/70551.html","bookId":414,"book":{"id":414,"title":"The Cavalier","description":"简介： Our camp was in the heart of Copiah County, Mississippi, a mile or so west of Gallatin and about six miles east of that once robber-haunted road, the Natchez Trace.
