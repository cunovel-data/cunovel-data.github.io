{"id":44066,"no":37,"title":"XXXVII A HORSE! A HORSE!","content":"Night had fully come. A few bivouac fires burned low in the grove, and at one of them near the grove gate I found our young commander. On a bench made of a fence-rail and two forked stakes he sat between Quinn and the first-lieutenant of the Louisianians. The doctor whom I had seen before sat humped on his horse, facing the three young men and making clumsy excuses to Ferry for leaving. The other physician would stay for some time yet, he said, and he, himself, was leaving his instruments, such as they were, and would return in the morning. \"Fact is, my son\u0027s a surgeon, and he taken all my best instruments with him.\" \n \n \"When; where is he?\" eagerly asked Quinn, seeing Ferry was not going to ask. \n \n \"My son? Oh, he\u0027s in Virginia, with General Lee.\" \n \n \"Hell!\" grunted Quinn, but the doctor pretended to listen to Ferry. \n \n \"Ah, but we move south at day-light; the prisoners and wounded we send east, to Hazlehurst,\" said our leader, with a restraining hand on Quinn\u0027s knee. The other lieutenant made some inquiry of him, and the doctor was ignored, but stayed on, and as I stood waiting to be noticed I gathered a number of facts. The lightly injured would go in a plantation wagon; for the few gravely hurt there was the Harpers\u0027 ambulance, which had just arrived to take the ladies back to Squire Wall\u0027s, near Brookhaven, alas! instead of to Louisiana. For the ladies Charlotte\u0027s spring-wagon was to be appropriated, one of them riding beside it on horseback, and there was to be sent with them, besides Charlotte\u0027s old black driver, \"a reliable man well mounted.\" Whoever that was to be it was not Harry, for he was to go south with a small guard, bearing the body of the Louisiana captain to his home between the hostile lines behind Port Hudson. \n \n \"Good-night, gentlemen,\" said the doctor at last. As he passed into the darkness Quinn bent a mock frown upon his young superior. \n \n \"Lieutenant Ferry, the next time I have to express my disgust please to keep your hand off my knee, will you?\" \n \n Ferry\u0027s response was to lay it back again and there ensued a puerile tussle that put me in a precious pout, that I should be kept waiting by such things. But presently the three parted to resume their several cares, and the moment Ferry touched my arm to turn me back toward the house I was once more his worshipper. \"Well!\" he began, \"you have now two fine horses, eh?\" \n \n \"Oh, by Regulations, I suppose, I ought to turn one of them over to Major Harper. I wish it were to you, Lieutenant; I\u0027d keep my own--he\u0027ll be all right in a day or two--and give you Captain Jewett\u0027s.\" \n \n \"Well,--just for a day or two,--do that, while I lend my horse to a friend.\" \n \n I had already asked myself what was to become of Charlotte Oliver while the Harpers were preempting her little wagon, and now I took keen alarm. \"Why, Lieutenant, I shall be glad! But why not lend Captain Jewett\u0027s horse and keep yours? Yours is right now the finest and freshest mount in the command.\" \n \n \"Yes, \u0027tis for that I lend him.\" \n \n We went on in silence. Startled and distressed, I pondered. What was her new purpose, that she should ask, or even accept, such a favor as this from Ned Ferry; a favor which, within an hour, the whole command would know he had granted? Was this a trifle, which only the Gholson-like smallness of my soul made spectral? The first time I had ever seen Ferry with any of his followers about him, was he not on Charlotte\u0027s gray, now, unluckily, beyond reach, at Wiggins? Ah, yes; but Beauty lending a horse to speed Valor was one thing; Valor unhorsing himself to speed Beauty--oh, how different! What was the all-subordinating need? \n \n As we entered the hall I came to a conviction which lightened my heart; the all-subordinating need was--Oliver. I thought I could see why. The spring of all his devilish behavior lay in those relations to her for which I knew she counted herself chargeable through her past mistakes. Unless I guessed wrong her motives had risen. I believed her aim was now, at whatever self-hazard, to stop this hideous one-woman\u0027s war, and to speed her unfinished story to the fairest possible outcome for all God\u0027s creatures, however splendidly or miserably the \"fool in it\" should win or lose. We stopped and waited for Cécile and the remaining doctor, she with a lighted candle, to come down the stairs. From two rooms below, where most of the wounded lay, there came women\u0027s voices softly singing, and Charlotte\u0027s was among them. Their song was one listening to which many a boy in blue, many a lad in gray, has died: \"Rock me to sleep, mother.\" \n \n Cécile and the doctor had come from the bedside of the union captain, where Miss Harper remained. \"I\u0027ve done all I can,\" he said to Ferry; \"we old chill-and-fever doctors wa\u0027n\u0027t made for war-times; he may get well and he may not.\" \n \n \"Smith,\" said Ferry, \"go up and stay with him till further orders.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2561/70553.html","bookId":414,"book":{"id":414,"title":"The Cavalier","description":"简介： Our camp was in the heart of Copiah County, Mississippi, a mile or so west of Gallatin and about six miles east of that once robber-haunted road, the Natchez Trace.
