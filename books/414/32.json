{"id":44061,"no":32,"title":"XXXII A MARTYR\u0027S WRATH","content":"Great news the aide-de-camp brought us; from Lee, from Longstreet, Bragg and Johnston. Johnston was about to fall upon Grant\u0027s rear. Across the Mississippi Dick Taylor was expected this very day to deal the same adversary a crippling blow, and it was partly to mask this movement that we had made our feint upon the Federals near Natchez. Now these had fallen back, and our force had cunningly slipped away southward. Only General Austin and his staff had not gone when Lieutenant Helm left the front, and they were about to go. Toward the end of the meal Mrs. Sessions, in her amiable plantation drawl, said she hoped the bearer of so much good tidings had not come to take away Lieutenant Ferry; and when Harry, flushing, asked what had given her such a thought, the simple soul replied that Mr. Gholson had told her he \"suspicioned as much.\" At once there arose the prettiest clamor all round the board, in which Charlotte and CÃ©cile joined for the obvious purpose of making confusion. Gholson turned yellow and spoke things nobody heard, and Ferry tried to drown Harry\u0027s loud declarations that the word he had brought to Ferry was for him to stay, and that he had found him saddling up to go in search of his company. \"Isn\u0027t that so, Ned?--Now,--now,--isn\u0027t that so?\" We left the table all laughing but Gholson. He tried to say something to Harry, which the latter waved away with mock gaiety until on the side veranda we got beyond view of the ladies, when the aide-de-camp reddened angrily and turned his back. As the two lieutenants were lighting cigarettes together, Harry, thinking Gholson had left us, blurted out, \"Oh, that\u0027s all very well for you to say, Ned, but, damn him, he\u0027s not the sort of man that has the right to \u0027suspicion\u0027 me of anything; slang-whanging, backbiting sneak, I know what he\u0027s here for.\" On that the blood surged to Ferry\u0027s brow, but he set his mouth firmly, locked arms with the speaker and led him down the veranda. Gholson took on an uglier pallor than before and went back into the house. I followed him. He moved slowly up the two flights of hall stairs and into a room close under the roof, called the \"soldiers\u0027 room\". It had three double beds, one of them ours. Without a fault in the dreary rhythm of his motions he went to the bedpost where hung his revolver, and turning to me buckled the weapon at his waist with hands that kept the same unbroken measure though they trembled and were as pallid as his face. In the same slow beat he shook his head. \"Smith, I rejoice! O--oh! I rejoice and am glad when I\u0027m reviled and persecuted by the hounds of hell, and spoken evil against falsely for my religion\u0027s sake.\" \"Now, Gholson, that\u0027s nonsense!\" \"O--oh! that\u0027s what it\u0027s for! that\u0027s what he meant by \u0027slang-whanging.\u0027 That\u0027s what it\u0027s for from first to last, no matter what it\u0027s for in between; and I know what it\u0027s for in between, too, and Ned Ferry knows. Did you see Ned Ferry take him under his protection? O--oh! they\u0027re two of one hell-scorched kind!\" My companion stood gripping the bedpost and fumbling at his holster. I sank to the bed, facing him, expecting his rage to burn itself out in words, but when he began again his teeth were clenched. \"You heard him tell Ned Ferry he knows why I\u0027m here. It\u0027s true! he does know! he knows I\u0027m here to protect a certain person from him and--\" \"From whom? from Harry Helm? Oh, Gholson, that\u0027s too fantastical!\" \"From him and the likes of him! Not that he loves her; that\u0027s the difference between them two cotton-mouth moccasins; Ned Ferry, hell grind him! does--or thinks he does; that other whelp don\u0027t, and knows he don\u0027t; he\u0027s only enam\u0027--\" \"HUSH!\" He ceased. \"I swear, Scott Gholson, you must choose your words better when you allude--Lieutenant Helm is the last man in the brigade to be under my protection, but--oh, you\u0027re crazy, man, and blind besides. Harry Helm is not in love, but he thinks he is, though with quite another person!\" \"O--oh! whether he loves or not, or whoever he loves, I know who he hates; he hates me and my religion; our religion, Smith, mine and yours; because it\u0027s put me between him and her. What was that the preacher said this morning? \u0027The carnal mind, being enmity against God, is enmity against them that serve God.\u0027 O--oh, I accept his enmity! it proves my religion isn\u0027t vain! I\u0027m glad to get it!\" All this from his oscillating head, through his set teeth, in one malign monotone. As he quoted the preacher he mechanically drew his revolver. There was no bravado in this; he might lie, but he did not know how to sham; did not know, now, that his face was drawn with pain. Holding the weapon in one hand, under his absent gaze he turned it from side to side on the palm of the other. I put out my hand for it, but he dropped it into the holster and tried to return my smile. \"Do you propose to call him out?\" I asked. \"You can\u0027t call out an officer; you\u0027ll be sent to the water-batteries at Mobile.\" \"I\u0027ve thought of all that,\" he droned. \"Then why do you put that thing on?\" \"Why do I put it on? Why, I--you know what I told you about that Yankee--\" \"Gholson,\" I exclaimed, for I saw that murder, even double murder, was hatching in his heart, with Charlotte Oliver for its cause, and looked hard into his evil eyes until they overmatched mine; whereupon I made as if suddenly convinced. \"You\u0027re right!\" I turned, whipped on my own belt with its two \"persuaders,\" and blandly smoothing my ribs, added \"Now! here are two ready, Yankees or no Yankees.\" I never saw a face so unconsciously marked with misery as Gholson\u0027s was when we started downstairs. I stopped him on a landing. \"Understand, you and I are friends,--hmm? I think Lieutenant Helm owes you an apology, and if you\u0027ll keep away from him I\u0027ll try to bring it to you.\" The reply began with a vindictive gleam. \"You needn\u0027t; I ain\u0027t got any more use for it than for him. I never apologized to a man in my life, Smith, nor I never accepted an apology from one; that\u0027s not my way.\" Near the bottom of the second flight we met Charlotte, who, to make bad worse, would have passed with no more than a smile, but the look of Gholson startled her and she noticed our arms. With an arresting eye I offered a sprightly comment on the heat of the day, and while she was replying with the same gaiety I whispered \"Take him with you.\" How nimbly her mind moved! \"Oh Mr. Gholson!\" she said, and laughed to gain an instant for invention. \"Mr. Gholson, can you tell me the first line of the last hymn we sang this morning?\" Her beam was irresistible, and they went to the large parlor. I turned into the smaller one, opposite, where Squire Sessions started from a stolen doze and, having heard of my feeling for books, thrust into my hands, and left me with, the \"Bible Defense of Slavery.\" As I moved to a window which let out upon the side veranda the two lieutenants came around from the front and stood almost against it, outside; and as I intended to begin upon Harry as soon as Squire Sessions was safely upstairs, this suited me well enough. But the moment they came to the spot I heard Ned Ferry doing precisely what I had planned to do. At the same time, from across the hall came the sound of the piano and of Charlotte\u0027s voice, now a few bars, then an interval of lively speech, again a few bars, then more speech, and then a sustained melody as she lent herself to the kind flattery of Gholson\u0027s songless soul. \"But he is!\" I overheard the aide-de-camp say; \"he is a backbiting sneak, and I tell you again he\u0027s backbitten nobody more than he has you!\" \"And I tell you again, Harry, that is my business.\" \"If he wants to fight me he can; I\u0027ll waive my rank.\" \"No, you will not, you have no right; our poor little rank, it doesn\u0027t belong to us, Harry, \u0027tis we belong to it. \u0027If he wants to fight!\u0027--Do you take him for a rabbit? He is a brave man, you know that, old fellow. Of course he wants to fight. But he cannot! For the court-martial he would not care so much; I would not, you would not; \u0027tis his religion forbids him.\" \"O--oh!\" groaned Harry in Gholson\u0027s exact tone, \"\u0027Hark from the tombs\u0027!\" \"Ah!\" said Ferry, \"he does not live up to it? Well, of course! who does? But we will pass that; the main question is, Will you express the regret, and so forth, as I have suggested, and do yourself credit, Harry, as an officer and a gentleman, or--will you fight?\" \"But you say his religion, so called, won\u0027t let him fight!\" \"That\u0027s what I think; but if it forbids him, and if consequently he will not, well,--Harry,--I will.\" \"You will what!\" \"I will have to fight you in his place.\" \"Why, Ned!--Ned!--you--you astound me! Wha\u0027--what do you mean?\" \"That is what I mean, Harry. You know--many times you have heard me say--I don\u0027t believe in that kind of thing; I find that worse than the religion of Gholson; yet still,--what shall I say?--we are but soldiers anyhow--this time I make an exception in your favor. And of course this is confidential, on both sides; but you must make peace with Gholson, or you must fight with me.\" \"Oh, good Lord!--Ned!--Good Lord A\u0027mighty! but this is too absurd. Why, Ned, don\u0027t you see that the bottom cause of this trouble isn\u0027t--\" \"I know what is the bottom cause of this trouble very well, Harry; you can hear her in yonder, now, singing. Wherever Gholson is he hears her, too, like-wise. Perchance \u0027tis to him she is singing. If she can sing to him, are you too good to apologise?\" \"Oh, I\u0027ll give him the benefit of the doubt, Ned, damned if I don\u0027t! George! I\u0027ll apologize! Rather than lose your friendship I\u0027d apologize to the devil!\" Ferry\u0027s thanks came eagerly. \"Well, anyhow, old boy,\" he added, \"in such a case to back down is braver than to fight; but to apologize to the devil--that is not hard; on the contrary, to keep from apologizing to the devil--ah! I wish I could always do that!--I wonder where is Dick Smith.\" I stealthily laid down the \"Bible Defense of Slavery\" and was going upstairs three steps at a stride, when I came upon Camille and Estelle. My aim was to get Harry\u0027s revolver to him before he should have the exasperating surprise of finding Gholson armed, and to contrive a pretext for so doing; and happily a word from the two sisters gave me my cue. With the fire-arms of both officers I came downstairs and out upon the veranda loud-footed, humming-- \"\u0027To the lairds o\u0027 Convention \u0027twas Claverhouse spoke, Ere the sun shall go down there are heads to be--\u0027 \"Gentlemen, I hope I\u0027m not too officious; they say we\u0027re all going for a walk in the lily-pond woods, and I reckon you\u0027d rather not leave these things behind.\" Both thanked me and buckled on their belongings, but Ferry\u0027s look was peculiarly intelligent; \"I was in the small parlor, looking for you,\" he said; \"I thought you would be near the music.\" And so he had seen Gholson with his revolver on him, and must have understood it! \"Smith,\" said Harry, \"will you be so kind as to say to Gholson--oh, Lord! Ned, this is heavy drags on a sandy road! I--\" \"That\u0027s all right, Harry, I withdraw the request.\" \"Well, you needn\u0027t; I was in the wrong. Smith, will you say to Gholson--\" His voice dropped to a strictly private rumble. \"Yes, Lieutenant, I\u0027ll do so with pleasure, and I\u0027m sure what you say will have the proper--here are the ladies.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2561/70548.html","bookId":414,"book":{"id":414,"title":"The Cavalier","description":"ç®ä»ï¼ Our camp was in the heart of Copiah County, Mississippi, a mile or so west of Gallatin and about six miles east of that once robber-haunted road, the Natchez Trace.
