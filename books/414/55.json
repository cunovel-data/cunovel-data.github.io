{"id":44084,"no":55,"title":"LV RESCUE AND RETREAT","content":"I sprang for the door, but the fire-log sent me sprawling with my shoulder on the threshold. As I went down I heard in the same breath the wounded officer wailing \"Go back! go in! there are only four of them! don\u0027t leave one alive!\" and Miss Harper all but screaming \"Our men! our men! God be praised, our men are coming, they are here! Fly spoilers, for your lives, fly!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And it was true. Their hoofs rumbled, their carbines banged, and their charge struck three sides of the house at once. Rising only to my elbows,--and how I did that much, stiffened with my wound, the doctors will have to explain,--I laid my cheek to my rifle, and the light of two windows fell upon my gunsights. Every blue-coat in the hall was between me and its rear window, but one besides the officer was wounded, and with these two three others were busy; only the one remaining man saw me. Twice he levelled his revolver, and twice I had almost lined my sights on him, but twice Miss Harper unaware came between us. A third time he aimed, fired and missed. I am glad he fired first, for our two shots almost made one report, and-he plunged forward exactly as I had done over the fire-log, except that he reached the floor dead. \\n\\n Ferry fired under his flash and sent him reeling into the arms of his followers. \\n\\n \\n\\n Thereupon came more things at once than can be told: Miss Harper\u0027s outcry of horror and pity; Charlotte\u0027s cry from the bedside--\"Richard! Richard!\" a rush of feet and shouts of rage in the hall below; and my leap to the head of the stairs, shouting to half a dozen gray-jackets \"Two men, no more! two men to guard prisoners, no more! go back, all but you two! go back!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n A sabreless officer with a bandaged hand flew up the stair and into my face. It was Helm. \"The ladies! Smith, good God! Smith, where are the girls?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"In the smokehouse,\" cried Miss Harper from her knees beside the prostrate Federal officer; \"go bring them!--Richard, Charlotte is calling you!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n I ran to Ferry\u0027s door; Charlotte was leaning busily over his bared chest, while he, still holding a revolver in his right hand, caressed her arm with his left. \"Dick, his wound has opened again, but we must get him away at once anyhow. Isn\u0027t my wagon still here?--oh, thank God! there it comes now, I hear it in the back yard!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n A Confederate waiting on Miss Harper with basin and towels barely dodged me as I sprang to the far end of the hall and shouted down into the yard for Harry. The little mules, true enough, were just rattling round a half turn at the lower hall\u0027s back door, having been in hiding behind the stables. A score or so of cavalry were boisterously hurrying off across the yard with a few captured horses and prisoners, and I had to call the Lieutenant angrily a second time, to make him hear me amid their din and a happy confusion which he was helping to keep up in a fairer group. For here were all the missing feminine members of the household, white and colored, and Harry was clamorous with joy, compassion and applause, while Camille and Cécile, pink with weeping, stepped out across the high doorsill of the smokehouse, leading Ned Ferry\u0027s horse and mine. \\n\\n \\n\\n However, there was not the urgency for instant flight that Charlotte had thought there was; night fell; a whole regiment of our mounted infantry came silently up from the rear of the plantation and bivouacked without lights behind a quarter of a mile of worm-fence; our two wounded and three unharmed prisoners, or Miss Harper\u0027s, I should say, for it was in response to her entreaties that the latter had thrown down their arms, were taken away; the dead man was borne out; lights glowed in every room, the servants returned to their tasks, a maddening fragrance came from the kitchen, and the three nieces flitted everywhere in their benign activities, never discovering the hurt on my shoulder until everything else on earth had been discovered, and then--\"Oh, Richard, Richard!\" from Estelle, with \"Reach-hard, Reach-hard!\" from Cécile, and \"Mr. Smith!\" from Camille, as they bathed and bound it. At length a surgeon arrived, gave a cheering opinion of Ferry and of Charlotte, and scolded Harry savagely for the really bad condition of his hand. Then sounds grew few and faint, our lights went out, we lay down fully dressed, and nearly all of us, for a while, slept. \\n\\n \\n\\n But about two in the morning Harry awakened me, murmuring \"Reach-hard! Reach-hard! come! our sick-train\u0027s moving. Ssh! General Austin\u0027s asleep in the next room!\" I asked where Ferry was. \"Already started,\" he whispered, \"--in the General\u0027s own ambulance, with Charlotte Oliver in hers, on a mattress, like Ned, and the four Harpers in theirs.\" While we stole downstairs he murmured on \"Our brigade\u0027s come up and General Austin will attack at daylight with this house as his headquarters.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n As we mounted I asked whither we were bound. \"Tangipahoa,\" he said; \"then by railroad to Brookhaven, and then out to Squire Wall\u0027s.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n At the first streak of dawn our slow caravan caught the distant notes of the battle opening behind us. \"That\u0027s Fisher\u0027s battery!\" joyously cried the aide-de-camp as we paused and hearkened back. \"Well, thank the Lord, this time nobody\u0027s got to go back for her doll; she\u0027s got it with her; I saw her, just now, combing its hair.\" We descended into a woody hollow, the sounds of human strife died away, and field and forest offered us only beauty, fragrance, peace, and the love-songs of birds. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/2561/70571.html","bookId":414,"book":{"id":414,"title":"The Cavalier","description":"简介： Our camp was in the heart of Copiah County, Mississippi, a mile or so west of Gallatin and about six miles east of that once robber-haunted road, the Natchez Trace.
