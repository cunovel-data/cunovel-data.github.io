{"id":42798,"no":29,"title":"Chapter 29","content":"Again New Munich was shaken to its foundations by another startling episode in the chronicles of the Leitzels—the resurrection, as it were, of their New Mennonite step-mother, who took up her residence in a pretty little old stone house a few doors from Daniel\u0027s gaudy mansion; the most expensive location in the town, with the trained nurse, who had taken care of Mrs. Danny Leitzel when the twins were born, established in charge of the old woman\u0027s cozy small home, as her companion and housekeeper. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What would we do without you Leitzels to keep us interested, not to say excited?\" Mrs. Ocksreider remarked to Margaret one day when she met her on the street. \"I never knew they had a step-mother.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"She has always lived out in the country at their old home,\" said Margaret, \"but we all thought she ought to be nearer to us now that she is getting so feeble and helpless; so we brought her in town.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You mean you brought her in?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mr. Leitzel and I, of course.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Did she tell you I had called on her?\" Mrs. Ocksreider inquired rather defiantly, not wholly free from an uncomfortable sense of embarrassment at the blatant curiosity that had taken her there. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, but I saw your card there with a number of others,\" said Margaret. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You are with the old lady a great deal, aren\u0027t you? It is so nice of you!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I am very fond of Mrs. Leitzel,\" Margaret replied. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, she is a dear,\" said Mrs. Ocksreider heartily; \"one of the sweetest little women I ever met. How prettily and cozily you have fixed up her house! She told me you had done it all!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I did enjoy getting her settled near me,\" Margaret smiled. \"She\u0027s the greatest comfort and blessing to me—to any one who has the good fortune to come into contact with her. I have known few people in my life so guileless, so kindly disposed toward every one! The world needs more of such souls, doesn\u0027t it, as a little leaven in the hardness and sordidness all about us?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Indeed we do!\" Mrs. Ocksreider piously agreed. \"And the dear old lady is equally fond of you, my dear,\" she assured Margaret, patting her arm. \"She seems so grateful to you,\" she added, putting out a feeler. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes?\" said Margaret noncommittally. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I see Miss Jennie and Miss Sadie going in to see her very often, too,\" said Mrs. Ocksreider tentatively. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, yes, every day. They are very attentive to their mother,\" Margaret replied quite soberly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Are they so fond of her, too?\" Mrs. Ocksreider asked, curiosity fairly radiating from her ample countenance. \"I had never in all these years of my acquaintance with them heard them so much as refer to their step-mother.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But you were never more than very formally acquainted with them,\" Margaret returned in a tone of dismissing the discussion. \"Has Miss Ocksreider got back from New York?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, I expect her to-night. Come in to see her, Mrs. Leitzel—she adores you! And so few of us see anything of you at all since your babies came. You don\u0027t go anywhere any more, do you? Society certainly does miss you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You are very kind to say that. I am very much tied down, of course.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If you could get a good, capable nurse,\" suggested Mrs. Ocksreider, again tentatively. Margaret did not know that the town was agog at the fact, that, rich as Danny Leitzel was, his wife kept no child\u0027s nurse for her babies. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I am trying to get one, Mrs. Ocksreider.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If I hear of one, I\u0027ll send her to you. Of course you were at the luncheon yesterday, however? Every one was at that.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What luncheon?\" asked Margaret vaguely. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What luncheon? She asks what luncheon!\" exclaimed Mrs. Ocksreider, casting up her eyes in horror. \"The Missionary Jubilee Luncheon of course!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh!\" cried Margaret, blushing, for this Missionary Jubilee Luncheon had been an orgy of religious sentimentality in which the entire town had united and nothing else had been talked of for weeks. \"I had forgotten all about it. I wasn\u0027t out of the house yesterday,\" she added apologetically. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But didn\u0027t Miss Jennie and Miss Sadie tell you? I remember seeing them in the throngs.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They didn\u0027t speak of it,\" replied Margaret, not adding the information for which Mrs. Ocksreider yearned, that they did not, these days, tell her anything, since they \"did not speak as they passed by.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But Mrs. Leitzel,\" pursued Mrs. Ocksreider, \"how could you \u0027forget\u0027 a thing like our Missionary Jubilee, unless you were deaf, dumb, and blind?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Miss Hamilton never spoke of it to me, and I don\u0027t see many other people. The truth is,\" Margaret owned up, \"she and I were not specially interested in it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh! Why not?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, I\u0027m inclined to think that the so-called \u0027heathen\u0027 religions are, in most cases, as good as, or better than, the substitute offered by the half-educated missionaries.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Half-educated!\u0027 Oh, but our missionaries are not half-educated, Mrs. Leitzel!\" exclaimed Mrs. Ocksreider, shocked. \"Do you know, sometimes I think you are not religious! And one of the women missionaries said yesterday that a woman without religion was like a flower without fragrance, or a landscape without atmosphere.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Epigrammatic,\" nodded Margaret, undisturbed. \"I doubt whether she thought that up herself.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, but she was a beautiful speaker! I only just wish you had heard her! You believe at least in a Supreme Being, don\u0027t you, Mrs. Leitzel?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The absurdity of such discussion on the sidewalk was too much for Margaret\u0027s gravity and she helplessly laughed. But Mrs. Ocksreider looked so grieved over her that she sobered up and answered, \"I hope I have a religion.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What is your religion, Mrs. Leitzel?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, I have ideals. Any one with ideals is religious.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Is that all the religion you have?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s more than I can manage to live up to, and we\u0027d better not have very much more religion than we can live out, do you think so?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n This was rather too deep water for Mrs. Ocksreider and she changed the subject. \"Oh, well, every one has to settle these questions her own way. I should think,\" she quickly added, evidently not willing to miss her chance of clearing up a matter that was in her mind, \"that Miss Jennie and Miss Sadie would be rather jealous of their mother\u0027s devotion to you. She talks so much of you and she never speaks of them.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m new, you see,\" said Margaret, starting to move on as she felt the ice getting thin. How these New Munich women could pry! \"Good-bye,\" she nodded as she hurried away before she could be further sounded. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t wonder, though,\" she thought on her way home, \"that people are curious and suspicious. How Jennie and Sadie can have the face, after years of cruel neglect of their mother, to lavish upon her, now that she has a fortune to will away, such obsequious and constant attention and devotion—oh, it\u0027s nauseating! And their mother isn\u0027t a fool; she is not taken in by it for one minute, I can see that.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n It was only that morning that, when she had run in to see Mrs. Leitzel for a minute, she had found her just concluding a strictly private interview with her New Mennonite preacher and a young lawyer of the town whom Margaret knew by sight. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t tell Danny what you seen here, my dear, will you?\" the old woman nervously asked when they were alone. \"Danny would take it hard that I got another lawyer to tend to my business. But you see, Margaret, I have afraid Danny would lawyer my money all off of me if he got at it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll not say a word to him,\" Margaret had reassured her. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Jennie and Sadie, and Hiram when he comes to see me, now, once a week, worries me so to make my will,\" she continued in a distressed voice. \"Hiram he tells me Danny\u0027s got so much more\u0027n what he has and you got more\u0027n what his Lizzie has, so I had ought to leave what I got to his children. And Jennie and Sadie says they can\u0027t hardly get along since they had to give up so much to me and I had ought to leave it to them when I die, because Danny\u0027s got a-plenty to do with a\u0027ready and a rich wife yet, and Hiram lives so tight he don\u0027t need more\u0027n what he\u0027s got. \u0027And, anyway,\u0027 Jennie says to me, \u0027of course I and Sadie would will all we had to Danny\u0027s and Hiram\u0027s children. You could even make your will so\u0027s we\u0027d have to, Mom.\u0027 And then Danny he comes in and he says, \u0027You know, mother, it was my wife that has been so kind and generous to you, persuading us all that even if the coal lands did belong, in the first place, to my own mother, we ought to give you your share. It was Margaret that wouldn\u0027t leave us put you in a home, where Hiram and Jennie and Sadie were all for puttin\u0027 you. And I listened on Margaret, mother, and wouldn\u0027t do it; so I don\u0027t think it would be more\u0027n right for you to leave your share of my mother\u0027s estate to me, seeing that it was through my wife that you got any of it.\u0027 Well, Margaret, they all kep\u0027 worryin\u0027 me so that now to-day I did make my will oncet. Now I can say to \u0027em when they ast me about it, that my will is made a\u0027ready.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It is too bad that you should be worried about it so!\" said Margaret sympathetically. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Even Hiram\u0027s Lizzie comes to see me and asks me about my will, for all I think it\u0027s Hiram puts her up to it; she don\u0027t want to do it. I took notice a\u0027ready, my dear, you are the only one of \u0027em all that never spoke nothin\u0027 to me yet how I was a-goin\u0027 to will away my money. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We have more interesting things to talk about, haven\u0027t we? I\u0027ve run in this morning to tell you that Mary Louise has beat Sonny cutting teeth—she has two, and he hasn\u0027t one, the lazy fellow! I\u0027ll wager, grossmutter, she\u0027ll keep ahead of him straight through life!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But Sonny\u0027s anyhow fatter\u0027n sister,\" maintained the proud grandmother, between whom and Margaret there was kept up a constant play of favouritism as to the babies. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Jennie says I\u0027m letting Sonny get too fat and that it\u0027s dreadfully unwholesome.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sonny ain\u0027t too fat!\" the jealous grandmother retorted indignantly; \"he\u0027s wery neat!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If he would only draw the line at being \u0027neat,\u0027 but he\u0027s getting a tummy like an alderman\u0027s!\" Margaret anxiously declared. \\n\\n \\n\\n They laughed together over the joke and the old woman looked up fondly into the bright, sweet face at her side. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You always cheer me up, dearie, when you come. The others never talk to me about nothin\u0027 except how I\u0027m a-goin\u0027 to make my will, and how I\u0027m spendin\u0027 so much of my income, and how extravagant you fitted up this house for me with money that was rightly theirn; and oh, my dear, I got so tired of hearin\u0027 about the money off of \u0027em! The only other thing they ever want to talk about——\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She stopped short and closed her lips. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Is the wicked, designing Jezebel that Danny has for a wife! Oh, yes, I know. It\u0027s too bad, my dear, that they should fret you so! But perhaps now that you can tell them your will is made, they\u0027ll stop teasing you. I\u0027m going to bring the babies in to see you this afternoon. I must run along now; I have to go downtown and get Sonny some new booties; he chewed up the last pair and they didn\u0027t agree with him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Again the old woman laughed delightedly. Margaret could not realize what a refreshment and comfort she was to her. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But before you go, Margaret, I want to ast you what Hiram means by this here postal card I got off of him this morning in the mail.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Margaret took the card offered to her and read: \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \"D. V. will come to see you Saturday to read the Scriptures with you and have prayer with you. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"In haste, your affectionate son, \\n\\n \"REV. HIRAM LEITZEL.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know who this D. V. is that\u0027s coming,\" said Mrs. Leitzel anxiously. \"Do you, my dear? And I haven\u0027t the dare to hear religious services with a world\u0027s preacher; it\u0027s against the rules of meeting.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027D. V.\u0027 stands for two Latin words, \u0027Deo volente,\u0027 \u0027God willing.\u0027 Hiram means he will be here, God willing. I hope for your sake, God won\u0027t be willing!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, but ain\u0027t you and Hiram got the grand education!\" exclaimed Mrs. Leitzel admiringly. \"Well, if he does come, I can\u0027t leave him have no religious services with me. Us New Mennonites, you know, we darsent listen to no other preachers but our own, though I often did wish a\u0027ready I could hear one of Hiram\u0027s grand sermons. They do say he can stand on the pulpit just elegant!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Margaret kissed her, without comment upon Hiram\u0027s greatness as a preacher, and came away. \\n\\n \\n\\n She was sincerely sorry that Daniel\u0027s sisters must, in the nature of things, continue to regard her with bitter antagonism. She could have borne it with perfect resignation if circumstances had not constantly brought them together, for Jennie and Sadie came almost daily to her home to see after their brother\u0027s little comforts and to fondle his precious babies for an hour, though they never in their visits deigned to recognize Margaret\u0027s existence. They would sail past her in her own front hall, without speaking to her, and go straight to the nursery, or to Daniel in his \"den.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Having been the means of depriving them of some of their income, she was unwilling to take from them, also, the pleasure they had in the babies; so beyond a mild suggestion to Daniel that he might tell them they must treat her with decent courtesy in her own home, or else stay away from it, she did not interfere with their visits, though she tried to keep out of their way when they did come. \\n\\n \\n\\n Daniel, on his part, was aghast at the bare suggestion of further endangering his children\u0027s inheritance by telling his sisters they must be civil to his wife in her own home or stay away. He considered Margaret\u0027s sense of values to be hopelessly distorted. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was not surprising that Margaret and old Mrs. Leitzel turned with infinite relief from the society of the rest of the Leitzels to find in each other an escape from a materialism as deadly to the soul\u0027s true life as ashes to the palate. It was of the babies they talked mainly: of their cunning ways; of Margaret\u0027s plans and ambitions for them; of the new clothes she was making for them; of Daniel\u0027s devotion to and pride in them. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Leitzel also heard with delighted interest Margaret\u0027s anecdotes of her sister\u0027s children: how little Walter had called up the family doctor on the telephone to ask whether when you got chicken-pox you got feathers, and the doctor had said, \"Not only feathers, but you crow every morning,\" and now little Walter prayed every night that he might soon have chicken-pox; also, how three-year-old Margaret, after an operation for a swollen gland in her neck, had informed some visitors, \"I had an operation on my neck and the doctors cut it out.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Leitzel, in her turn, would relate to her by the hour anecdotes of her past life, some of which proved very illuminating to Margaret as to the Leitzel characteristics, and gave her much food for thought. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I used to have so afraid to be all alone—I can\u0027t tell you what it is to me to feel so safe like what I do now, with this here kind Miss Wenreich takin\u0027 care of me; and not bein\u0027 afraid to take a second cup of tea when I feel fur it; because now when my tea is all, I kin buy more; and havin\u0027 no fear of freezin\u0027 to death if my wood gets all fur me and I not able to go out and chop more; and not being forced any more to eat only just what would keep me alive. To have now full and plenty and to feel safe and at peace—and to have you to love me! And the dear babies! \\n\\n \\n\\n \"One day, my dear, sich a sharper come to my house out there in the country and he says, \u0027Where\u0027s your husband at?\u0027 Well, he looked so wicked (fur all, he was nice dressed) that I didn\u0027t say to him, \u0027I\u0027m a widow, my husband ain\u0027t livin\u0027!\u0027 I had so afraid if he knowed I was alone, he might do me somepin. So I sayed, \u0027You kin tell me your business, I\u0027m the same as Mister.\u0027 \u0027You run things and handle the money, do you?\u0027 he ast me. \u0027Well, then, I want you to give some fur to buy Bibles fur the poor.\u0027 I said I didn\u0027t have no money to spare, but I had an exter Bible I could give him. I knowed well enough he was a sharper, but I thought mebby my old Bible might do him some good. So I offered it to him. But he said the Lord didn\u0027t want no second-hand stuff fur His poor. \u0027You\u0027re not a Christian,\u0027 he said, \u0027if you won\u0027t give any to buy new Bibles fur the poor.\u0027 And Margaret, he looked so ugly, I had so afraid of him, I shook all over; but I purtended to call Mister, and him dead near twenty years. Well, but at that, the sharper took hisself off! Goodness knows what he might of done at me if I hadn\u0027t of purtended to call Mister! Ain\u0027t? Well,\" she drew a long sigh, \"them worryin\u0027 days is all over now, thanks to you, my dear. It\u0027s as Danny says: I\u0027d be in the poorhouse if it hadn\u0027t of been fur you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Margaret often marvelled, as she found herself deriving the keenest pleasure from old Mrs. Leitzel\u0027s happiness and deep content, how the Leitzels could so blindly miss, in their selfish materialism, the true sources of joy in life. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1853/53688.html","bookId":968,"book":{"id":968,"title":"Her Husband\u0027s Purse","description":"简介： The Pennsylvania town of New Munich was electrified by the sudden and entirely unlooked-for announcement of the betrothal of Daniel Leitzel, Esquire; but his two maiden sisters with whom he lived, and to whom the news was also wholly unexpected, were...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1853","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:04 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:04 AM"}}
