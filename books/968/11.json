{"id":42780,"no":11,"title":"Chapter 11","content":"Margaret\u0027s instinct for self-preservation, being rapidly educated along new lines since her marriage, closed her lips in the presence of Jennie and Sadie upon the great delight she found in her new acquaintance, her husband\u0027s secretary; for though the standards of value which the Leitzels held as to most things in life had at first seemed to her incomprehensible, she was of late beginning to have a glimmering understanding of them. So, upon returning to the sitting-room after Miss Hamilton\u0027s call, she repressed any expression of her happiness, and not until she and Daniel were alone in the automobile which he had hired this afternoon for her pleasure, and incidentally for his own, did she speak of it. She had not yet learned the necessity of hiding from him, also, almost everything that she felt and thought. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"This is a red letter day for me, Daniel. I\u0027ve found a friend! I\u0027ve never had an intimate girl friend—oh! but I\u0027ve yearned for one! Of all the many people I\u0027ve met since I came here, there hasn\u0027t been one except that Miss Mary Aucker, who has since gone to Boston for the winter, whose society I\u0027d prefer to that of a book or solitude. I\u0027m not naturally a very good \u0027mixer,\u0027 I\u0027m afraid, but in ten minutes Miss Hamilton and I—well, we simply found each other, deep down where we both live! It\u0027s such a novel and wonderful experience to me!\" she softly exclaimed, her eyes shining. \"It\u0027s going to give me the greatest happiness I\u0027ve ever known!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The greatest happiness you\u0027ve ever known! Why, Margaret——\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I mean that I\u0027ve ever known with a woman,\" she said soothingly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But, my dear!\" he exclaimed, \"what can you be thinking of? You can\u0027t make a friend of my secretary!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If she is a lady?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But she isn\u0027t. They don\u0027t go anywhere, these Hamiltons!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They are a cultured New England family, Daniel, and if they don\u0027t go into society here, it is probably because they don\u0027t want to. I\u0027m sure I can\u0027t imagine why they should want to. I don\u0027t mean, dear,\" she quickly added, not at all sincerely, \"to cast any reflection upon your New Munich society; I\u0027m speaking of society in general. It is rather unsatisfactory, isn\u0027t it? I wouldn\u0027t give up the friendship I\u0027m going to have with Miss Hamilton for all the rest of New Munich society, I assure you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But you must give it up! Why, my dear, the Hamiltons are renters!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Renters?\u0027\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, renters!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What are \u0027renters?\u0027\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You know what I mean—they don\u0027t own the house they live in, they rent it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh!\" Margaret fell back laughing against the seat of the car. \"Of course if I had known that, Daniel, I shouldn\u0027t have found Miss Hamilton congenial, sympathetic, and companionable. Oh, Daniel!\" she gasped with laughing. \\n\\n \\n\\n But Daniel\u0027s sense of humour was not developed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You must be on your guard more, my dear,\" he gravely warned her, \"or you will be getting yourself involved most uncomfortably with troublesome people. Do let Jennie and Sadie be your guides as to whom you should cultivate here and whom keep at a proper distance.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Jennie and Sadie be my—select my friends for me?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Instruct you as to those among whom you may select for yourself,\" he amended it. \"They know New Munich and you don\u0027t.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And they,\" thought Margaret wonderingly, \"think themselves \u0027above\u0027 a cultured, sophisticated, well-bred girl like Miss Hamilton—they!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But, Daniel,\" she asked, genuinely puzzled, \"that nice little woman that called yesterday, that I liked so much, said her husband was a grocer. I confess it rather shocked me. But you all seemed to approve of her. In New Munich is a grocer better than a teacher?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He\u0027s a wholesale grocer, which makes a vast difference, of course.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Does it? And was the drygoods person who was with her also wholesale?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mrs. Frantz? No, but she\u0027s rich, very rich. They own their handsome home at the head of our block. Listen, Margaret! While you were in the parlour with Miss Hamilton, Jennie and Sadie helped me make up the list for our party, and even I myself could not have discriminated more astutely than they did (Jennie especially) as to whom we ought to invite and whom we ought not. On Monday I\u0027ll have one of my office clerks address the envelopes for the invitations on a typewriter.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, my God, Daniel! You can\u0027t send typewritten invitations!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"For goodness\u0027 sake, Margaret, cut out swearing! I\u0027d be horribly mortified if any one heard you!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Margaret was silent. \\n\\n \\n\\n Daniel turned to glance at her uneasily, fearing he had offended her, but she was red with suppressed laughter and as she met his eye it broke forth in a little squeal. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, Daniel,\" she sighed, \"swearing isn\u0027t as bad as slang, dear. I\u0027d much rather hear you say \u0027Damn it\u0027 than \u0027cut it out.\u0027\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She looked so pretty in her sable furs, another inheritance from an ancestor, that, the automobile being covered, he seized her face in his two hands and held his lips to hers for a long minute. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Daniel,\" she said when he at last released her, \"remind me to look over the list before you send the invitations. I may want to add some names.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think you will, dear. We drew up the list very carefully.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll glance over it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But, Margaret,\" he firmly insisted, \"the list is complete as it stands. You can\u0027t add any name to it that would not be objectionable to my sisters and me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I understand that the party is to be a large general affair, not small and exclusive? In that case, you know, we shall have to invite every one who has called and sent us gifts.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Impossible! Why, our butcher sent us a gilt-framed Snow-Scene! and Sadie\u0027s dressmaker a souvenir spoon!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then at least we must invite every one who has called on me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"By no means. Wait until you have lived here long enough to have gotten your bearings and you\u0027ll see how right Jennie and Sadie and I are in drawing the line so carefully.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Margaret wisely desisted from further discussion of the matter, though she felt troubled by her conviction that she would certainly not find on that list the names of the few women of the town who had really interested her and who were probably \"renters\" or self-supporting or something else which, by the Leitzel standard, would class them with \"dogs and sorcerers.\" But it was she and Daniel who were giving the party, and even though Jennie and Sadie did keep house for them, she was of course the nominal mistress of her husband\u0027s home and responsible for the courtesy or discourtesy extended to their acquaintances; and she did not like the idea of being made to appear a petty snob in the eyes of the few people of New Munich for whose opinion of her she cared. But what could she do about it? \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The people they seem to approve of have been the most vulgar who have called on me,\" she reflected. \"And the few persons of breeding and education I\u0027ve met here they have flouted. Yet I recognize the delicacy of their position—Jennie\u0027s and Sadie\u0027s—living here in their brother\u0027s house and dependent upon him. I don\u0027t want to assert myself in a way to make them feel their dependence. What can I do?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Another thing, Margaret,\" said Daniel in a tone of authority, \"I want to ask you not to make yourself common with people beneath you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Make myself \u0027common?\u0027\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why, you are as common with my secretary as you are with Mrs. Ocksreider or Mrs. and Miss Miller!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m \u0027common?\u0027\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t you think you are?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, in Charleston we weren\u0027t considered just to say common people, Daniel, though perhaps we were over-estimated.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Good heavens, Margaret, I don\u0027t mean that you yourself are common; I certainly wouldn\u0027t have married you if I had thought that. I mean you make yourself—well, too democratic. That\u0027s what I mean, too democratic.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The prerogative of the well-born, Daniel, who don\u0027t feel the necessity for snobbishness. Have you fixed the date for the party?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, the twenty-second; three weeks from yesterday. I\u0027ll have the house decorated by a Lancaster florist and I\u0027ll have a caterer from Philadelphia.\" He repeated with relish his astonishing intention. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But, Daniel, are you sure we can afford all that?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He laughed exultantly. \"Well, my dear, I\u0027ve never given a large party and I\u0027m going to impress the town! It will be the swellest thing that was ever given here! Why shouldn\u0027t it be? I can afford it—that is,\" he pulled himself up, \"I can afford it once in a while, and,\" he added with feeling, \"I\u0027m celebrating the happiest event of my whole life. You\u0027re worth all that it will cost, Margaret!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Thanks!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027re welcome, my dear.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We must invite your step-mother to the party, Daniel.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n A slight start expressed Daniel\u0027s disturbed surprise at this unexpected suggestion. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"She\u0027s too old and too—well, too unworldly.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He winced from the discovery that Margaret must some time make, that his step-mother was a Mennonite, talked Pennsylvania Dutch, was wholly uneducated and, in short, a disgrace to the Leitzel family. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We must send her a card, Daniel, whether she comes or not.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, no; she might take a notion to come!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But that would be lovely! I am so fond of old ladies. Why do you say \u0027No?\u0027\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t want her \u0027round!\" he snapped fretfully. \"Don\u0027t send her an invitation! She lives only fifteen miles from here and I do believe she\u0027d come if she were invited, she\u0027s so proud of being related to us! You see, Margaret,\" he added, preparing the way a bit, \"she\u0027s not exactly our equal, I\u0027m sorry to tell you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then,\" thought Margaret, \"she\u0027s undoubtedly a very superior woman!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Daniel!\" she suddenly proposed, \"if she lives only fifteen miles away, let\u0027s motor out to see her.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We haven\u0027t time,\" said Daniel shortly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Some other time then? I\u0027d like to meet her.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Perhaps.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Won\u0027t she be at Hiram\u0027s to-morrow at the family party at Millerstown?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why not?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Because Hiram won\u0027t invite her. We have very little to do with her, my dear, except to give her her home.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You do that?\" She wondered at the number of people he supported. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, she lives in our old home near our coal lands. We don\u0027t charge her any rent.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m going out to see her some time, Daniel. Since you don\u0027t care to visit her, I\u0027ll take Miss Hamilton. I\u0027d like to see your coal lands and your old home.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Daniel looked apoplectic. \"Margaret!\" he gasped. \"Listen to me! Don\u0027t speak to any one of my step-mother! Hardly any one knows we have one and we don\u0027t want them to know it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Gracious! Why not?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We\u0027re ashamed of her, Margaret. She\u0027s not a lady, though I don\u0027t see why that should reflect on us, since she isn\u0027t a blood relation. And as to Miss Hamilton, haven\u0027t I made it clear to you that it would humiliate me unbearably to have my wife seen in company with my stenographer?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, but, Daniel, my dear, because her family are \u0027renters?\u0027 There, there,\" she patted him, \"don\u0027t worry about me. I\u0027m twenty-five years old, you know, and am surely competent to choose my own friends. And it\u0027s better to be renters than rotters. Let us go home, now, will you? It\u0027s getting late, and I\u0027m cold—and hungry. Jennie promised us buckwheat cakes for supper. Tell me all about your brother Hiram\u0027s family,\" she added when Daniel had ordered the chauffeur to turn home. \"How many children has he? I\u0027ll be so glad to get some children into my arms again—I\u0027m so awfully homesick for Hattie\u0027s babies!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n There was a little catch in her voice and Daniel answered sympathetically: \"I\u0027d like to see Hattie\u0027s babies again myself! They certainly are nice little children—the most aristocratic looking children, Margaret, I ever saw. I hope,\" he lowered his voice, \"that our children will be as aristocratic looking.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Margaret closed her eyes for an instant as though to shut out some things she did not wish to see. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How many children?\" she repeated after a moment. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Four: Zwingli, Naomi, Christian, and Daniel. Daniel, the baby, is my namesake of course. You see, Hiram had about decided I wasn\u0027t going to marry and that having no children of my own, I\u0027d do well by my namesake. But,\" Daniel chuckled, \"I fooled him, didn\u0027t I?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Do you like his wife?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, yes, he did very well, very well indeed. Lizzie\u0027s worth thirty thousand dollars.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He paused expectantly. Here was Margaret\u0027s chance to speak up and tell him what she was worth. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If she\u0027s worth that much,\" was Margaret\u0027s comment, \"she certainly ought to be all wool and a yard wide. But I asked whether you liked her.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why, yes, she\u0027s a good wife,\" returned Daniel, disappointed, his tone dejected. Why couldn\u0027t he make Margaret talk property? \"Hiram married the richest woman in Millerstown. And she\u0027s a very capable and economical woman, too. You\u0027ll hear my brother preach to-morrow,\" he added with pride, cheering up a bit. \"He\u0027s a fine preacher. So considered in Millerstown. If he had gone into the ministry younger, he\u0027d have made his mark in his profession just as I have done in the law; but he was nearly thirty when he began to study. Yes,\" said Daniel as the car drew up at their door, \"you\u0027ll hear a great sermon when you hear my brother Hiram preach.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1853/53670.html","bookId":968,"book":{"id":968,"title":"Her Husband\u0027s Purse","description":"简介： The Pennsylvania town of New Munich was electrified by the sudden and entirely unlooked-for announcement of the betrothal of Daniel Leitzel, Esquire; but his two maiden sisters with whom he lived, and to whom the news was also wholly unexpected, were...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1853","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:04 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:04 AM"}}
