{"id":42792,"no":23,"title":"Chapter 23","content":"\"Why!\" exclaimed Jennie as she grudgingly shook hands with her step-mother when Margaret returned with her to the sitting-room. \"You here! We saw Danny downtown just now and he said he gave you money to get home.\" \n \n \"Yes,\" added Sadie, also shaking hands reluctantly, \"we didn\u0027t look to see you here. Anyhow Danny thought you went to the depot from his office.\" \n \n \"But,\" smiled Margaret, \"she gave me the pleasant surprise of a call. I am so glad, because I wanted so much to know her, my husband\u0027s mother and the babies\u0027 grandmother! How pretty your flowers look, Sadie!\" she added diplomatically and quite insincerely, for she groaned inwardly at the bunch of little artificial roses Sadie girlishly wore on the lapel of her coat. \n \n \"What is this to do?\" Jennie suddenly demanded as her eyes fell upon the tea-table. \n \n \"We\u0027ve been having tea and toast.\" \n \n \"Well!\" breathed Sadie. \n \n \"Upon my word!\" exclaimed Jennie. \"You stopped Emmy in her Sa\u0027urday\u0027s work to make tea and toast in the middle of the afternoon yet!\" \n \n \"It took her just fifteen minutes.\" \n \n \"She ain\u0027t ever to be hindered in her Sa\u0027urday\u0027s work! She has a cake to bake for Sunday then!\" \n \n \"But you know,\" said Margaret patiently, \"you stopped her on wash day to make tea for Mrs. Ocksreider.\" \n \n \"Well, but Mom ain\u0027t used to tea in the afternoon and Mrs. Ocksreider is. Anyhow, who\u0027s keeping house here, Margaret?\" \n \n \"But surely I may have a cup of tea with your mother if I wish to, in this house!\" \n \n \"But it up-mixes my accounts when you do somepin like this. Danny pays half of all the expenses here and Sadie and I pay half.\" \n \n \"Oh, I see,\" Margaret breathed rather than spoke. \"But after all, Jennie, it\u0027s quite a simple matter—charge the tea, sugar, milk, bread, and butter to Daniel\u0027s side of your account and I\u0027ll take the responsibility of it.\" \n \n Jennie turned abruptly to her step-mother. \"It\u0027s getting late on you, Mom, to get out home. You don\u0027t want to get there after dark, with a half a mile to walk from the station yet. Before I take off my coat and hat, I better see you on the street car that\u0027ll take you to the depot for the five o\u0027clock train.\" \n \n \"Yes, Jennie,\" the old woman submissively answered, \"I was just a-goin\u0027 to start to go when you come.\" \n \n She rose with an effort from the comfortable chair before the fire in which Margaret had again placed her. But Margaret at once pressed her back into her seat. \n \n \"You will be glad to know, Jennie, that I have persuaded mother to spend the night with us,\" she said, \"as she is too tired from her journey to go back before to-morrow.\" \n \n \"You will be glad to know, Jennie, that I have persuaded mother to spend the night with us,\" Margaret said \n \"You will be glad to know, Jennie, that I have persuaded mother to spend the night with us,\" Margaret said \n \n \"She never stops the night with us, Margaret,\" Jennie coldly returned. \"Come on, Mom, I\u0027ll put you on the street car.\" \n \n \"But isn\u0027t it nice,\" cried Margaret, holding her arm around Mrs. Leitzel to keep Jennie off, \"that I\u0027ve succeeded in coaxing her to stay to-night? Such a pleasant surprise for Daniel when he comes home, to find you here, dear! What is home without a grandmother? Good discipline for Daniel, too, to have to give up this armchair for one evening! Even I have to get out of it when he wants it. But naturally he can\u0027t put his mother out of the only really comfortable chair in the house.\" \n \n \"But Danny paid for that chair,\" explained Sadie. \"It would be funny—ain\u0027t?—if he couldn\u0027t sit in his own chair when he wants!\" \n \n \"The spare-room bed ain\u0027t made up,\" Jennie frowned at Margaret. \"And nobody has time to make it up at four o\u0027clock on Saturday afternoon! Anyhow, strangers stopping over night is apt to give Sadie the headache. And Mom never wants to be away from her own bed. She won\u0027t can home herself in a strange bed, can you, Mom?\" \n \n But Margaret spoke before Mrs. Leitzel could reply. \"I\u0027ll make up the guest bed. It won\u0027t take me ten minutes. Mother\"—she patted Mrs. Leitzel\u0027s shoulder—\"I\u0027ll be right downstairs again in ten minutes.\" \n \n But Mrs. Leitzel clung to her hand. \"Don\u0027t let me alone with—stay by me, Margaret——\" she pitifully pleaded. \n \n \"You shall come upstairs with me, then, to my room,\" Margaret said, helping her, now, to rise to her feet. \n \n \"No, Margaret, Mom\u0027s to go back on the five o\u0027clock train,\" affirmed Jennie peremptorily. \"Our Danny give her the money to go back. It ain\u0027t for you to be using our clean linens to make up the spare bed. Come on, Mom.\" \n \n Jennie laid an ungentle grasp upon her step-mother\u0027s arm, but Margaret, her face suddenly ablaze with indignation, confronted her. \n \n \"Jennie! This is my husband\u0027s home, and his feeble mother shall be his guest and mine until to-morrow morning.\" \n \n \"She ain\u0027t his mother, she ain\u0027t even a blood relation. And what right have you, I\u0027d like to know, to meddle in our family affairs?\" Jennie fiercely demanded. \"It\u0027s just your contrariness that makes you want to do everything that you see will spite us; for what other reason would a person like you have for taking up with an uneducated old woman like Mom? You wouldn\u0027t look at a person like her if it was not to spite us!\" \n \n \"What right have I? The right of the humane to protect the helpless from brutality, under any and all circumstances, without exception. She shall not leave this house to-day!\" \n \n \"Now, Mom,\" Sadie turned on her step-mother, \"you see what you make by coming here like this, without leaving us know! Ain\u0027t you worrying us enough all the time, without raising more trouble between us and Danny\u0027s wife yet?\" \n \n \"Yes, yes, I\u0027ll go. Please, my dear\"—she turned to Margaret,—\"leave me go. I\u0027d rather die on the way home than stay and make it unhappy for you, Margaret! Danny will take up for them, you know, so I can\u0027t stay and make trouble. Leave me go, my dear!\" \n \n \"But if you don\u0027t make your mother welcome here,\" Margaret addressed both Jennie and Sadie, \"I shall have to go with her. I can take her to Catherine Hamilton\u0027s for the night. Or,\" she added with sudden inspiration, \"to Mrs. Ocksreider\u0027s, and ask her if she won\u0027t give her a bed until the morning. She shall not take that journey to-night!\" \n \n Jennie glared in baffled fury, while Sadie turned white with dismay. \n \n \"Danny won\u0027t leave you do such an outrageous thing!\" the elder sister said hoarsely. \n \n \"Daniel can\u0027t stop me. Come, mother.\" \n \n \"You don\u0027t mean to say you\u0027d do as mean a thing as that—take Mom to Mrs. Ocksreider\u0027s!\" \n \n \"But I am so sure that Mrs. Ocksreider is the very person who would be very glad to receive her for the night.\" \n \n \"You up and tell me to my face you\u0027d disgrace us like that!\" \n \n \"But where would the disgrace come in?\" asked Margaret innocently. \n \n \"Where would the disgrace come in?\" repeated Jennie hotly. \"Don\u0027t you see any disgrace in telling Mrs. Ocksreider that we won\u0027t leave our mother (even if she is our step-mother) sleep at our place over night?\" \n \n \"Then you admit that you are acting disgracefully in turning her out?\" \n \n \"You wait till Danny comes home and he\u0027ll show you if you can go against me like this in his house!\" Jennie violently threatened, more furious than ever at being trapped by her own words. \"Now you leave Mom be till I take her out to the car!\" \n \n \"No, Jennie, if she goes I go with her—to our friend, Mrs. Ocksreider. Therefore, it behooves you——\" \n \n But it was just at this instant that the sitting-room door opened and Daniel walked into their midst. \n \n \"Margaret! I\u0027ve got an automobile at the door. Get your hat——\" \n \n He stopped short in astonishment at sight of his step-mother, at Margaret\u0027s attitude of shielding her against the evidently furious antagonism of Jennie and the cold disapproval of Sadie. \n \n \"Well?\" he demanded testily. \"What\u0027s up? How did you get up here, mother?\" \n \n \"Yes, how did she, when you gave her the money to go home yet?\" scolded Sadie. \n \n Margaret, leaving the statement of the situation to Jennie, remained silent. \n \n \"Who brought you up here?\" Daniel inquired of the old woman. \n \n \"I come by myself, Danny. I wanted to see your wife and the twinses, and I conceited I\u0027d be gone before the girls got home. But I\u0027ll go right aways now. I\u0027m sorry I come. I didn\u0027t want to make no trouble—I——\" \n \n She made a movement from Margaret\u0027s side, but the latter clasped her firmly. \n \n \"Margaret,\" commanded Daniel, \"let her go.\" \n \n \"I have invited her to spend the night here, Daniel. She is not able to go home to-night.\" \n \n \"I\u0027ll take care of that—this is not your affair. Let her alone! Take your hands off her!\" \n \n \"Will you let her spend the night here?\" \n \n \"I said I would take care of that. Take your hands off her.\" \n \n Margaret obeyed. \n \n \"Now come here, mother.\" \n \n Mrs. Leitzel walked feebly toward him, but Margaret walked beside her. \n \n \"Now, you see, Danny, how contrary she acts!\" Jennie broke forth. \"I wanted to take Mom out to the trolley car and Margaret would not leave her come along, when Mom said she wanted to come, too!\" \n \n \"Well, I\u0027m here now,\" returned Daniel grimly. \"I\u0027ll take you to the station, mother,\" he pronounced conclusively, taking the old woman\u0027s arm. \n \n \"Daniel! Your mother can\u0027t go home alone this evening! It will be cruel of you to send her!\" \n \n Daniel, ignoring her, led his mother to the hall. \n \n \"I tell you I\u0027m going to stop this cruelty!\" cried Margaret, darting upstairs to get her wraps. \n \n She was down again almost immediately, her coat over her arm, but when she reached the sidewalk the automobile containing her husband and his mother was beyond her reach. \n \n \"I may be able to get to the station before that five o\u0027clock train!\" she thought, starting almost on a run to go the length of the town to the depot, putting on her coat and gloves as she went. \"I believe his mother will die on the way if she goes, and has to walk that half-mile alone in the dark, after being subjected to all this horrible scene! Oh, my God! What people they are!\" \n \n She realized, on her way, that her purse was empty, her monthly allowance having been spent, and that she had not even money for trolley car fares—a serious handicap in her efforts to help Mrs. Leitzel. \n \n When, panting for breath, a sharp pain in her side, she reached the station, the train to Martz was just pulling out. \n \n Daniel, smiling blandly, came toward her along the platform. \n \n \"God help me!\" was the cry of her heart, \"that I cannot even hate him—he is too utterly pitiable! If I could hate him, there might be some hope for us!\" \n \n \"Want to take a little ride, my dear?\" he inquired, waving his hand to the waiting automobile. \n \n \"Take me home,\" she returned weakly, feeling suddenly collapsed and helpless. \n \n \"You know,\" he said as he helped her into the car, \"you ought not to excite yourself like this—it\u0027s bad for Daniel Junior\u0027s milk—about something, too, that is no concern of yours. And I want to warn you also,\" he added, lowering his voice so that the chauffeur might not hear him, as the car turned into the street, \"that you\u0027ve got to refrain from offending Jennie and Sadie so constantly. They have a lot of money to leave to our children. Keep on offending them as you are doing and they\u0027ll will all they have to Hiram\u0027s children!\" said Daniel in a tone that expressed all the horror that such a possibility contained for him. \n \n Margaret did not reply. \n \n \"You get me?\" Daniel inquired. \n \n \"Considerations like that, Daniel, have never entered into my philosophy of life, thank God!\" \n \n \"Margaret, you really must break yourself of this dreadful habit of swearing! It\u0027s so unladylike! And so unchristian!\" \n \n \"Oh, my good Lord, Daniel! Don\u0027t dare to talk to me about anything\u0027s being \u0027unchristian,\u0027 when you have just done a cruel, cruel thing to your aged, helpless mother! I don\u0027t profess and loudly flaunt my \u0027Christian principles,\u0027 but I do believe in the Golden Rule. Evidently you don\u0027t. Don\u0027t speak to me!\" \n \n \"Hoity-toity! Cut out these tantrums, Margaret; they\u0027re bad for the boy, you know.\" \n \n \"Why don\u0027t you tell the Y.W.C.A. about your smart \u0027deal\u0027 with your tenant, George Trout, and your treatment of your step-mother? Maybe they\u0027d send you another congratulatory letter that you could have published in the Intelligencer.\" \n \n \"You heed my warning about offending Jennie and Sadie,\" was Daniel\u0027s reply. \n \n \"At the time of your father\u0027s death was the title of the farm at Martz vested absolutely in him?\" \n \n Margaret had the satisfaction of seeing Daniel start and turn red at her question, as he turned abruptly and looked at her. \n \n \"What makes you ask that?\" he nervously demanded. \n \n \"Was it?\" she repeated. \n \n \"Why do you wish to know?\" \n \n \"It was,\" she affirmed. \n \n \"How do you know?\" he sharply questioned. \n \n \"That same old Woman\u0027s Intuition.\" \n \n \"I insist on your answering me intelligibly! What do you know of business matters like that anyhow?\" \n \n \"Not much, but a little.\" \n \n \"Understand, Margaret, once and for all, that my business affairs and that of my folks are no least concern of yours!\" \n \n \"Yours are.\" \n \n \"They are not!\" \n \n \"Oh, yes, they are, Daniel. You and I are life partners and I am the mother of your heirs. Therefore, I have everything to do with your business. Neither I nor my children shall live on stolen money.\" \n \n \"Stolen money! You talk to me of \u0027stolen money,\u0027 when I stand in this community as the one honest, upright, Christian lawyer! Gracious, Margaret, I certainly expected that after the children were born I\u0027d have back again the sweet girl I married! I\u0027m beginning to feel that I\u0027ve been awfully taken in!\" \n \n Margaret leaned back in the automobile, closed her eyes, and did not answer. During the remainder of the ride the silence between them was unbroken. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1853/53682.html","bookId":968,"book":{"id":968,"title":"Her Husband\u0027s Purse","description":"简介： The Pennsylvania town of New Munich was electrified by the sudden and entirely unlooked-for announcement of the betrothal of Daniel Leitzel, Esquire; but his two maiden sisters with whom he lived, and to whom the news was also wholly unexpected, were...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1853","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:04 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:04 AM"}}
