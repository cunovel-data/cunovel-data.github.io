{"id":42770,"no":1,"title":"Chapter 1","content":"The Pennsylvania town of New Munich was electrified by the sudden and entirely unlooked-for announcement of the betrothal of Daniel Leitzel, Esquire; but his two maiden sisters with whom he lived, and to whom the news was also wholly unexpected, were appalled, confounded. That Danny should have taken such a step independently of them (who did all his thinking for him outside of his profession) was a cataclysmal episode. Of course it never would have happened without their knowledge if Danny had not been temporarily away from his home on business and far removed from their watchful care—watchful these twenty years past that no designing Jezebel might get a chance at the great fortune of their petted little brother—though it must be admitted that Danny was by this time of a marriageable age, being just turned forty-five. \n \n \"To think he\u0027d leave us learn about it in the newspapers yet, sooner \u0027n he\u0027d come home and face us with it! Yes, it looks anyhow as if he was ashamed of the girl he\u0027s picked out!\" exclaimed Jennie, a stern and uncompromising spinster of sixty, as she and her sister Sadie, sitting in the elaborately furnished and quite hideous sitting-room of their big, fine house on Main Street, stared in consternation at the glaring headlines of the New Munich Evening Intelligencer, which announced, in type that to the sisters seemed letters of flame, the upsetting news of their idolized brother having been at last matrimonially trapped. Being confronted with his betrothal in print seemed to make it hopelessly incontrovertible. They might have schemed to avert the impending catastrophe of his marriage (in case Danny had been taken in by an Adventuress) did not the Intelligencer unequivocally state (and the Intelligencer\u0027s statements were scarcely less authoritative to Jennie and Sadie Leitzel than the Bible itself) that Danny would be married to the Unknown inside of a month. If the Intelligencer said so, it seemed useless to try to stop it. \n \n \"To think he\u0027ll be married to her already before we get a chance, once, to look her over and tell him if she\u0027d suit him!\" lamented Sadie who was five years younger than Jennie. \n \n \"Well,\" pronounced Jennie, setting her thin lips in a hard line, \"she\u0027ll find out when she gets here that she ain\u0027t getting her fingers on our Danny\u0027s money! She\u0027ll get fooled if she\u0027s counting on that. She\u0027ll soon learn that she\u0027ll have to do with just what he likes to give her and no more! And of course Danny\u0027ll consult us as to just how much he ought to leave her handle. When she finds out,\" Jennie grimly prophesied, \"that our Danny always does the way we advise him to and that she\u0027ll have to keep on the right side of us, I guess she won\u0027t like it very well!\" \n \n \"We can only hope that she ain\u0027t such a bold, common thing that just took our Danny in, that way!\" sighed Sadie. \n \n \"But why would he hurry it up so, like as if he was afraid we would mebby put a stop to it? She put him up to fixing it all tight before he could change his mind!\" Jennie shrewdly surmised. \n \n \"It does look that way!\" fretted Sadie. \n \n Jennie, the elder sister, was tall, gaunt, and rawboned. Though approaching old age, her dominating spirit and grasping ambitions had preserved her vigour, physically and mentally. Her sharp face was deeply lined, but the keenness of her eyes was undimmed, her shoulders were erect, her hair was thick and black. The expression of her thin slit of a mouth was almost relentlessly hard. \n \n Sadie, five years younger, had also a will of her own, but happily it had always operated on a line so entirely in harmony with that of her sister, that they had lived together all their lives without friction, the younger woman unconsciously dominated by the elder. Indeed, no one could abide under the same roof with Jennie Leitzel who ventured openly to differ with her. Fortunately, even Sadie\u0027s passion for dress did not clash with Jennie\u0027s miserliness, for Sadie, too, was miserly, and Jennie loved to see her younger sister arrayed gorgeously in cheap finery, her taste inclining to that of a girl of sixteen. A dormant mother-instinct, too, such as must exist, however obscurely, in every frame of woman, even in that of a Jennie Leitzel, found an outlet in coddling Sadie\u0027s health and in ministering to and encouraging a certain plaintiveness in the younger woman\u0027s disposition. So, these two sisters, depending upon and complementing each other, of congenial temperaments, and with but one common paramount interest in life, the welfare of their incomparable younger brother whom they had brought up and of whom they were inordinately proud, lived together in the supreme enjoyment of the high estate to which their ambitions and their unflagging efforts had uplifted the Leitzel family—from rural obscurity to prominence and influence in their county town of New Munich. \n \n To be sure, the sisters realized that they held what they called their \"social position\" only as appendages to Danny—Danny who had been to college, who was the head of a great corporation law firm, who was enormously rich and a highly eligible young man; that is, he used to be young; and though New Munich regarded him as a confirmed old bachelor, his sisters still looked upon him as a dashing youth and a great matrimonial prize. They were not ashamed, but proud, of the fact that people tolerated them because they were Danny\u0027s sisters. \n \n It may seem strange that anything calling itself \"society\" could admit women so crude as Jennie and Sadie, even though they were appendages to a bait so dazzling as Danny Leitzel, Esquire. But in communities where the ruling class is descended from the Pennsylvania Dutch, \"society\" is remarkably elastic and has almost no closed doors to the appeal of wealth, however freighted it may be with vulgarity and illiteracy; and, be it known, Danny\u0027s sisters were not only financially independent of Danny, but even wealthy, quite in their own right. \n \n In spite of this fact, however, what social footing they had in the little town of New Munich had not been acquired so easily as to make it appear to them other than a very great possession. \n \n As to the big, fine house in which they lived, it had been Danny\u0027s money which, in the early days of his prosperity, had, at his sisters\u0027 instigation, built this grand dwelling on the principal street of New Munich, to dazzle and catch the town. \n \n The room in which the sisters sat to-night would have seemed to one who knew them a perfect expression of themselves—its tawdry grandeur speaking loudly of their pride in money and display, and of, at the same time, their penuriousness; the absence of books and of real pictures, but the obtrusive decorations of heavy gilt frames on chromos; the luridly coloured domestic carpets; heavy, ugly upholstered furniture, manifesting the unfortunate combination of ample means with total absence of culture. It would seem that in a rightly organized social system women like these would not possess wealth, but would be serving those who knew how to use wealth. \n \n \"To think our Danny\u0027d marry a stranger, yet, from away down South, when he could have picked out Congressman Ocksreider\u0027s daughter, or Judge Kuntz\u0027s oldest girl—or Mamie Gundaker and her father a bank president! Any of these high ladies of New Munich he could have!\" wailed Sadie. \"They\u0027d be only too glad to get our Danny! And here he goes and marries a stranger!\" \n \n \"It ain\u0027t like him that he\u0027d up and do this thing behind our backs, without askin\u0027 our adwice!\" Jennie exclaimed. \n \n \"Think of the grand wedding we could have had here in New Munich!\" Sadie sighed. \n \n \"And we don\u0027t even know if she\u0027s well-fixed or poor!\" cried Jennie in a wildly worried tone. \n \n \"But I hardly think,\" Sadie tried to comfort her, \"that Danny would pick out a poor girl. Nor a common one, either, so genteel as what we raised him!\" \n \n \"But men get so easy fooled with women, Sadie! If she\u0027s smart, she could easy come over Danny.\" \n \n \"Unless he got stubborn-headed for her.\" \n \n \"Well,\" admitted Jennie, \"to be sure Danny can get awful stubborn-headed sometimes. But if she\u0027s smart and found out how rich he is, she\u0027d take care not to get him stubborn-headed.\" \n \n \"Yes, that\u0027s so, too,\" nodded Sadie. \"I wonder if she\u0027s a fancy dresser?\" \n \n Sadie\u0027s love of clothes was second only to her devotion to Danny. She was dressed this evening in a girlish Empire gown made of red cheesecloth. \n \n \"What will folks say to this news, anyhow?\" scolded Jennie. \"I\u0027ll have a shamed face to go on the street, us not knowing anything about it, not even who she is yet! If folks ast us, Sadie, we must leave on we did know—we\u0027ll just say, \u0027Oh, it ain\u0027t news to us!\u0027\" \n \n \"But how could we know much when Danny himself has knew her only a little over a month, Jennie?\" \n \n \"Yes, don\u0027t it, now, beat all?\" \n \n \"Yes, don\u0027t it!\" \n \n \"That shows what she is—marrying a man she knew only a month or so!\" \n \n \"Well, to be sure, it wouldn\u0027t take her even a month, Jennie, to see what a catch our Danny is.\" \n \n \"If she does turn out to be a common person,\" said Jennie with her most purse-proud look and tone, \"she\u0027s anyhow got to act genteel before folks and not give Danny and us a shamed face here in New Munich—high up as we\u0027ve raised our Danny and hard as we worked to do it yet!\" \n \n \"Yes, the idea!\" mourned Sadie. \n \n \"Yes, the very idea!\" nodded Jennie vindictively. \"I shouldn\u0027t wonder,\" she added anxiously, always concerned for her sister\u0027s health which was really quite remarkably perfect, \"if this shock give you the headache, Sadie!\" \n \n \"I shouldn\u0027t wonder!\" Sadie shook her head sadly. \n \n \"Read me off the piece in the paper and see what it says all,\" Jennie ordered. \"But sit so the light don\u0027t give you the headache.\" \n \n Sadie, adjusting her spectacles and turning on the electric table lamp at her elbow, read the glaring article which had that evening appeared on the first page of their daily paper and which every household in New Munich was, they knew, now reading with feelings of astonishment, curiosity, disappointment or chagrin, as the case might be, for the sisters were sure that many heartaches among the marriageable maidens of the town would be caused by the news that Danny was no longer within their possible reach. These twenty-five years past he and his gold had been dangling before them—and now to have him appropriated, without warning, by a non-resident! \n \n The article was headed in large type: \n \n \n \"ONE MORE VICTIM OF CUPID\u0027S DARTS— \n DANIEL LEITZEL LED LIKE A LAMB \n TO HYMEN\u0027S ALTAR.\" \n \n \n Sadie breathed heavily as she read: \n \n \n In a communication received at this office to-day from our esteemed fellow-citizen, Daniel Leitzel, Esquire, sojourning for the past four weeks in the balmy South, we are informed of his engagement and impending marriage to \"a young lady of distinguished Southern lineage,\" one who, we may feel sure, will grace very acceptably the social circle here of which Mr. Leitzel is such a prominent, prosperous, and pleasant member. The news comes to our town as a great surprise, for we had almost begun to give Danny up as a hopeless bach. He will, however, lead his bride to Hymen\u0027s altar early next month and bring her straightway to his palatial residence on Main Street, presided over by his estimable sisters, Miss Jennie and Miss Sadie. New Munich offers its congratulations to her esteemed fellow-citizen, though some of us wonder why he found it necessary to go so far away to find a wife, with so many lovely ladies here in his native town to choose from. Love, however, we all know, is a capricious mistress and none may guess whither she may lead. \n \n The happy and fortunate lady, Miss Margaret Berkeley of Berkeley Hill, a distinguished and picturesque old colonial homestead two miles out of Charleston, S.C., is, we are informed, a lineal descendant on her mother\u0027s side of two governors of her native state and the niece of the learned scholar and eminent psychologist, the late Dr. Osmond Berkeley, with whom Miss Margaret made her home at Berkeley Hill until his decease a year ago, since which sad event she has continued to reside at this same homestead, her married sister and family living with her, this sister being the wife of a Charleston attorney with whom Daniel Leitzel, Esquire, has been conducting some legal railroad business in Charleston and through whom our esteemed fellow-citizen, it seems, met his happy doom. \n \n New Munich\u0027s most aristocratic society will anticipate with pleasurable interest the arrival of the happy bride and groom, Mrs. and Mr. Daniel Leitzel. No doubt many very elegant society events will take place this winter in honour of the newcomer among us; for New Munich is noted for its hospitality. \n \n \n \"It don\u0027t say,\" Jennie sharply remarked, \"whether she\u0027s well-fixed—though to be sure if she comes from such high people they\u0027d have to be rich.\" \n \n \"But her grand relations are all deceased, the paper says,\" returned Sadie despondently. \"You may better believe, Jennie, if she had money, Danny would have told the noospapers.\" \n \n \"It says in the paper she\u0027s living with her married sister, and it looks to me,\" Jennie shrewdly surmised, \"as if her brother-in-law (that lawyer Danny had dealings with) wanted to get rid of her and worked her off on our Danny. Or else that she took up with Danny to get a home of her own.\" \n \n \"Do you think Danny could be so easy worked?\" Sadie doubtfully inquired. \n \n \"He\u0027s a man,\" Jennie affirmed conclusively (though there were those among Danny\u0027s acquaintances who would not have agreed with Jennie); \"and any man can be worked.\" \n \n \"You think?\" \n \n \"To be sure. Danny would have been roped in long ago a\u0027ready if I hadn\u0027t of opened his eyes to it, still, when he was being worked.\" \n \n \"Yes, I guess,\" agreed Sadie. \"Say, Jennie, what\u0027ll Hiram say when he hears it, I wonder!\" \n \n Hiram was their brother next in age to Jennie, who, upon the family\u0027s sudden, unexpected access to wealth thirty-five years before, through the discovery of coal on some farm land they owned, had been a young farmer working in the fields, and had immediately decided to use his share of the money obtained from leasing the coal land to prepare himself for what had then seemed to him a dizzy height of ambition, the highest human calling, the United Brethren ministry. For twenty years now he had been pastor of a small church in the neighbouring borough of Millerstown. His sisters were very proud to have a brother who was \"a preacher.\" It was so respectable. They never failed to feel a thrill at sight of his printed name in an occasional number of the Millerstown New Era—\"Rev. Hiram Leitzel.\" But Hiram did not, of course, hold Danny\u0027s high place in their regard; Danny, their little brother whom they had reared and who had repaid them by such a successful career in money-making that he had, at the age of forty-five, accumulated a fortune many times larger than that he had inherited. \n \n \"Hiram will take it awful hard that Danny\u0027s getting married,\" affirmed Jennie. \"He\u0027d like you and me an Danny, too, to will our money to his children. He always hoped, I think, that Danny wouldn\u0027t ever get married, so\u0027s his children would get all. To be sure the ministry ain\u0027t a money-making calling and Hiram has jealous feelings over Danny that he\u0027s so rich and keeps getting richer. Hiram likes money, too, as much as Danny does.\" \n \n \"I wonder,\" speculated Sadie, \"if Danny\u0027s picked out as saving and hard-working a wife as what Hiram\u0027s got.\" \n \n The characteristic Leitzel caution that Hiram had exercised in \"picking out\" a wife had prolonged his bachelorhood far into middle life. He had now been married ten years and had four children. \n \n Keenly as the Leitzels loved money, none of them, not even Hiram himself, had ever regretted his going into the ministry. It gave him the kind of importance in the little borough of Millerstown that was manna to the Leitzel egotism. Hiram really thought of himself (as in his youth he had always looked upon ministers) as a kind of demigod; and as the people of Millerstown and even his own wife treated him as though he were one, he lived in the complacent enjoyment of his delusion. \n \n He had greatly pleased his sisters and his brother Daniel by marrying the daughter of the richest man in his congregation, and they all approved of the frugality by which he and his wife managed to live on the little salary he drew from his church, letting his inherited wealth and that of his wife accumulate for the children. \n \n \"It ain\u0027t likely,\" Jennie replied to Sadie\u0027s speculation, \"that Danny\u0027s marrying as well as Hiram married, when he\u0027s acting without our adwice.\" \n \n \"No, I guess anyhow not,\" agreed Sadie. \"Say, Jennie!\" she suddenly whispered mysteriously. \n \n \"Well, what?\" \n \n \"Will we leave Mom know about Danny\u0027s getting married?\" \n \n \"Well, to be sure she\u0027ll have to find it out,\" Jennie curtly answered. \"It\u0027ll mebby be printed in the County Gazette and she sees that sometimes.\" \n \n \"Say, Jennie, if Danny\u0027s wife is a way-up lady, what\u0027ll she think of Mom yet, with her New Mennonite garb and her Dutch talk that way, and all! My goodness!\" \n \n \"Well, a body can\u0027t help for their step-mothers, I guess!\" \n \n \"But she\u0027s so wonderful common and ignorant. I guess Danny would be ashamed to leave his wife see her. And his wife would laugh so at her clothes and her talk!\" \n \n \"But how would his wife ever get a chance to see her? We don\u0027t ever have Mom in here and we never take any one out to see her.\" \n \n \"That\u0027s so, too,\" Sadie acquiesced. \n \n \"I guess Hiram\u0027ll press it more\u0027n ever now that we\u0027d ought to put Mom to the poorhouse and rent our old home. The land would bring a good rent, he says, and we\u0027ve no call to leave her live on it free any longer. But I tell Hiram it would make talk if we put her to the poorhouse. Hardly any one knows we got a step-mother, and we don\u0027t want to start any talk.\" \n \n \"Yes, well, but how could they blame us when she ain\u0027t our own mother?\" Sadie protested. \n \n \"But you know how she brags about us so proud to her neighbours out there in Martz Township—just as if we was her own sons and daughters—and tells \u0027em how grand we live and how much Danny is thought of and how smart he is and what fine sermons Hiram preaches and how she kep\u0027 us all when we were little while Pop drank so and we hadn\u0027t anything but what she earned at the wash-tub! Yes,\" said Jennie indignantly, \"she tells it all right out perfectly shameless and anybody to hear her talk would think we was her own flesh and blood!\" \n \n \"Yes, it often worries me the way the folks out there talk down on us and say she always treated us like her own and we always treated her like a step-mother!\" fretted Sadie. \n \n \"Well, I guess we needn\u0027t mind what such common, poor country folks say about us!\" sneered Jennie. \"All the same\"—she suddenly lowered her voice apprehensively—\"we darsent start folks talking, or first thing we know they\u0027ll be saying we cheated Mom out of her widow\u0027s third because she was too ignorant to claim it!\" \n \n \"How would they have dare to say that when the land come from our own mother in the first place?\" pleaded Sadie. \"And Danny always says we\u0027ve got our moral right to all the money even if we haven\u0027t the legal right.\" \n \n \"Yes, and he always says, too, that if we ain\u0027t awful careful we\u0027ll have a lawsuit yet, and be forced to give a lot of our money over to Mom! Yes, I often say to Hiram, \u0027Better leave sleeping dogs lay,\u0027 I say, \u0027and not go tryin\u0027 to put Mom into the poorhouse.\u0027\" \n \n \"Yes, I guess anyhow then!\" breathed Sadie. \n \n \"By to-morrow\"—Jennie veered off from the precarious topic of their step-mother, for here was ice too thin for even private family handling—\"we\u0027ll be getting a letter from Danny giving us the details. Say, Sadie, if he don\u0027t offer to pay our way, I ain\u0027t using my money to travel that far to his wedding.\" \n \n \"Nor me, either,\" said Sadie. \"Do you think, Jennie,\" she anxiously asked, \"folks will talk at our still keeping house for Danny when he\u0027s married? You know how Danny always made us promise we\u0027d stay by him, married or single?\" \n \n Jennie sniffed. \"As if he could get along without us! As if any one else could learn his ways and how he likes things—and him so particular about his little comforts! He wouldn\u0027t leave us go away! And look at what he saves with us paying half the household expenses!\" \n \n \"And as for his wife\u0027s not liking it——\" began Sadie. \n \n \"As for her,\" Jennie sharply put in, \"she\u0027s coming here without asking us if we like it—she\u0027ll be put in her place right from the start.\" \n \n \"But if she\u0027s got money of her own mebby,\" Sadie suggested doubtfully, \"she could be independent, too, then.\" \n \n \"Well, to be sure she\u0027d put her money in her husband\u0027s care, wouldn\u0027t she?—and him a lawyer.\" \n \n \"A body couldn\u0027t be sure she\u0027d do that till they saw once what kind of a person she was, Jennie.\" \n \n \"Well,\" Jennie stoutly maintained, \"Danny\u0027ll see that she does.\" \n \n It will be noted that the story of Miss Berkeley\u0027s \"distinguished lineage\" did not greatly impress Jennie and Sadie Leitzel. They did not quite understand it. They knew nothing about such a thing as a distinguished lineage; New Munich \"aristocrats\" certainly did not have any; and the sisters\u0027 experiences being limited to life as it was in New Munich, whose \"first families\" were such only by reason of their \"means,\" Sadie and Jennie were ignorant of any other measure of excellence. To be poor and at the same time of any significance, was a combination unknown to them. \n \n As the newspapers did not state how closely those ancestral governors were related to Miss Berkeley, the relationship was undoubtedly so distant as to be negligible. \n \n The one thing that would have softened their attitude toward their new relative would have been an unequivocal statement as to the firm financial standing of her family. And on that point the newspaper, though furnished by Daniel himself with the facts, was ominously silent. The conclusion was unmistakable. She was certainly penniless. \n \n It was not greatly to be wondered at that the Leitzels worshipped money. It was money that had done everything for them: it had rescued them from a fearful struggle for a bare existence on a small, heavily mortgaged farm; it had freed them from the grind of slavish labour; from an obscurity that had been bitterly humiliating to the self-esteem and the ambition which was characteristic of every one of them. It was money that had given them power, place, influence; that made their fellowmen treat them with deference and relieved them from the necessity of treating any one else with deference. They knew of no worth in life unpurchasable by money. They did not, therefore, know of their own spiritual pauperism; their abject poverty. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1853/53660.html","bookId":968,"book":{"id":968,"title":"Her Husband\u0027s Purse","description":"简介： The Pennsylvania town of New Munich was electrified by the sudden and entirely unlooked-for announcement of the betrothal of Daniel Leitzel, Esquire; but his two maiden sisters with whom he lived, and to whom the news was also wholly unexpected, were...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1853","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:04 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:04 AM"}}
