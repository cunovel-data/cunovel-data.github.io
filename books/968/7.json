{"id":42776,"no":7,"title":"Chapter 7","content":"Margaret was surprised next morning at breakfast when a humorous reference on her part to \"Walter\u0027s funny little Yankee\" met with no response. \"But, Walter, he\u0027s a freak! Didn\u0027t you find him so, Harriet?\" \"Oh, I don\u0027t know. Walter says he\u0027s a wonder in his knowledge of the law.\" \"He has one of the keenest legal minds I\u0027ve ever met,\" declared Walter, \"though of course——\" He looked at Margaret uncertainly. \"Well, Margaret, after your eight years with a highbrow like your Uncle Osmond, most other men must seem, by contrast, rather stupid to you. Even I,\" he smiled whimsically, \"must feel abashed before such a standard as you\u0027ve acquired. But really, one can\u0027t despise a man who has reached the place in his profession that Leitzel has attained, even if he is a bit—eh, peculiar.\" It never occurred to Walter to recommend Leitzel by mentioning that he was a millionaire, the man\u0027s prominence in his profession being, in Eastman\u0027s eyes, the measure of his value. \"It\u0027s going to be rather rough on your husband, Margaret,\" Walter teased her, \"to have to play up to the intellectual taste of a wife that\u0027s lived with Osmond Berkeley.\" \"But, Walter, other things may appeal to me: kindness and affection, for instance. My life, you know,\" she said gravely, \"has been pretty devoid of that.\" There was a moment\u0027s rather awkward silence at the table, which Margaret herself quickly broke. \"This Mr. Leitzel—there\u0027s something positively uncanny in the way he seems to see straight through you to your back hooks and eyes; and I\u0027m quite sure if there was a small safety pin anywhere about me last night where a hook and eye should have been, he knew it and disapproved of it. I\u0027m certain that details like safety pins interest him; he has that sort of mind, if he is a great lawyer.\" \"Not great,\" Walter corrected her. \"I didn\u0027t say great. He\u0027s able and skillful; but, I must admit, very limited in his scope, his field being merely the legal technicalities involved in the management of a corporation. However, he\u0027s a nice enough little fellow. Didn\u0027t you find him so?\" \"I\u0027m afraid I found him rather absurd and tiresome.\" \"Take care, Margaret!\" Harriet playfully warned her, \"or else—oh! won\u0027t you have to be explaining away and apologizing for the things you are saying about that man. He\u0027s smitten with you!\" Margaret\u0027s eyes rested upon Harriet for a moment, while her quick intuition recognized just why her joking remarks about Mr. Leitzel had met with no response in kind: her sister was actually seeing in this queer little man a possible means of getting rid of her, and Walter was abetting her! She turned at once to the latter, swallowing the lump that had risen in her throat. \"Have you done anything, Walter, about securing me a loan on our property?\" \"I\u0027m doing my best for you, Margaret.\" \"Thank you. Any chance of success?\" \"I think so.\" He looked at her with a smile that was rather enigmatic, and she saw that he was really evading her. \"You know, Margaret,\" spoke in Harriet, \"I shouldn\u0027t consent for a moment to have a mortgage put on my property.\" \"Tut, tut, Harriet,\" Walter checked his wife. \"Leave it to me. Perhaps a mortgage won\u0027t be necessary.\" He rose hastily, made his adieus, and departed for his office. \"Margaret, dear,\" Harriet began as soon as they were alone, \"I assure you that to an unprejudiced observer, last night, the state of Mr. Leitzel\u0027s mind was only too manifest! You\u0027d have seen it yourself if you weren\u0027t so inexperienced.\" \"What are the signs, Harriet? I confess I\u0027d like to be able to recognize them myself.\" \"You sat almost behind him and he nearly cracked his neck trying to keep you in view. And when Walter drove him to the trolley line he talked of you all the way: said he liked your \u0027colouring\u0027 and your \u0027motherly manner,\u0027 and your hair and your voice and your smile and your walk! I\u0027m not making it up—he\u0027s simply hard hit, Margaret.\" \"You\u0027d like Mr. Leitzel for a brother-in-law, would you, Harriet?\" \"I shouldn\u0027t see much of him, living \u0027way up in Pennsylvania.\" Margaret, who had not yet given up craving wistfully her sister\u0027s affection, turned her eyes to her plate and stirred her coffee to hide the sensitive quiver of her lips. \"We\u0027d see each other very seldom, certainly, if I lived in Pennsylvania,\" she found voice to say after a moment. \"I\u0027ll go up to the baby, now, Harriet, and let Chloe come down.\" When later that morning a delivery wagon left at Berkeley Hill two boxes, one containing violets, the other orchids, and a boy on a bicycle arrived with a five-pound box of Charleston\u0027s most famous confectionery, all from Mr. Leitzel to Miss Berkeley, Margaret was forced to take account of the situation. Of course she could not know (fortunately for her admirer) that the lavishness of his offerings had been carefully calculated to impress upon her the fact which he suspected her relatives of concealing from her—the all-persuasive fact that he was rich. A telephone call inviting her to go automobiling with him that afternoon was answered by Harriet, who at once accepted the invitation for her without consulting her. \"I\u0027m perfectly willing, dear, to give up Mattie St. Clair\u0027s auction bridge this afternoon and chaperon you,\" Harriet graciously told her after informing her of the engagement she had made for her. \"Chloe will have to keep the children.\" Margaret made no reply. All these manifestations of Harriet\u0027s eager anxiety to be rid of her stabbed her miserably. She went away to her own room, just as soon as her regular domestic routine was accomplished, and shut herself in to think it all out. The fact that she had, because of the secluded life she had led, reached the age of twenty-five without ever having had a lover, must account for her feelings this morning toward Daniel Leitzel, her sense of gratitude (under the soreness of her heart at her sister\u0027s attitude to her) that any human being should like her and be kind, to the extent of such munificence as this which filled her room with fragrance and beauty. No wonder that for the time being she lost sight of the little man\u0027s grotesqueness in her keen consciousness of his kindness, and of the novelty of being admired—by a man. Yes, her momentary blindness even saw him as a man. Not even the cards which came with his offerings—the one in the candy box marked \"Sweets to the Sweet,\" and that with the flowers labelled, Thou shalt not lack The flower that\u0027s like thy face.—SHAKESPEARE. gave her more than a faint, passing amusement. \"The flower that\u0027s like thy face\u0027; he should have sent me a sunflower or a tiger-lily,\" she ruefully told herself as she glanced at her dark head in a mirror. But she recalled something she had once said to her Uncle Osmond: \"I\u0027d be grateful even to a dog that liked me.\" It was Harriet, not Margaret, who was shocked that afternoon at the revelation of poor Daniel\u0027s \"greenness\" when he found that Mrs. Eastman expected, as a matter of course, to chaperon her young sister. Daniel interpreted this unheard-of proceeding as another proof of his sharp surmise of the previous night—the penurious determination of the Eastmans to keep Miss Berkeley unmarried. He resented accordingly the interference with his own desires and the persecution of the young lady. He would show this greedy sister of Miss Berkeley that he was not the man to be balked by her scheming, and incidentally he would win the admiration and gratitude of the girl herself by his clever foiling of the designs of her relatives. \"I\u0027m very good to you and my sister, Mr. Leitzel,\" Harriet assured him as she and Margaret shook hands with him in the hall, both of them wrapped up for riding. \"I am giving up an auction bridge this afternoon to go with you.\" \"To go with us? But—but you misunderstood my invitation, I invited only Miss Berkeley,\" explained Daniel frankly. \"Oh, you have another chaperon then? If only you had told me so when you \u0027phoned this morning I needn\u0027t have given up my bridge party.\" \"Told you what, Mrs. Eastman?\" \"That you already had a chaperon.\" \"Had a—what?\" \"Haven\u0027t you a chaperon, Mr. Leitzel?\" \"\u0027Chaperon?\u0027 But this isn\u0027t a boarding-school, Mrs. Eastman!\" Harriet turned away to hide her face, but Margaret laughed outright as she asked him: \"Don\u0027t they have chaperons in Pennsylvania, Mr. Leitzel, to protect guileless and helpless maidens of twenty-five from any breach of strict propriety while out alone with dashing youths like you?\" \"If my sister went out alone with you in Charleston, Mr. Leitzel,\" explained Harriet with dignity, \"she would be criticised.\" \"But—but,\" stammered Daniel indignantly, \"I\u0027m a trustworthy man, Mrs. Eastman! A perfectly trustworthy gentleman!\" \"My dear Mr. Leitzel, I know you are! It\u0027s only a custom among us that—oh, come on, let us start! I\u0027m sorry, Mr. Leitzel, but I\u0027m afraid you\u0027ll have to put up with me.\" \"Yes, do let us start; we don\u0027t want to miss a minute of this lovely day!\" said Margaret brightly, moving toward the door and drawing her sister with her. \"I very seldom get a chance to ride, and I love it. You are so kind, Mr. Leitzel,\" she chatted as they went down the steps to the waiting car, \"to give me this pleasure, besides the beautiful flowers and delicious candy!\" And thus Daniel, though inwardly fuming, and wondering at Miss Berkeley\u0027s amiable submission to such unwarrantable meddling in her personal affairs, was forced to accept with what grace he could command the doubt cast upon his \"trustworthiness.\" As he assisted the two ladies into the automobile, Harriet of her own accord took the front seat with the chauffeur; and Daniel, as he realized how entirely isolated with Miss Berkeley this arrangement left him, felt himself thoroughly puzzled by the whole incomprehensible proceeding. As on the previous evening Miss Berkeley\u0027s Southern cordiality of manner was interpreted by Daniel during this drive to be a gushing warmth of feeling for himself, which fanned the flame of his egotism no less than that of his passion. While the car moved swiftly through the picturesque roads outside of Charleston he discoursed volubly; for Daniel\u0027s idea of an enjoyable conversation was a prolonged, uninterrupted exposition, on his part, to a silently absorbed listener, of his personal interests, achievements, excellencies of character, and general worthiness. He knew no greater joy in life than this sort of expansion before an admiring or envious companion. He fairly revelled this afternoon in the steady, monotonous stream of self-eulogy which flowed from his lips. It was meant to impress profoundly the maiden at his side, and it did. \"People call me lucky, Miss Berkeley, but it isn\u0027t luck; it\u0027s deep thinking. Nobody could be lucky that didn\u0027t use his judgment and keep a sharp lookout for the main chance. To have the wit to see and seize the main chance,\" he reiterated with an accent that made Margaret see the words in large capitals, \"that\u0027s the secret of success. Don\u0027t you think so?\" \"Yes, indeed—the point of importance being not to confuse one\u0027s values—material success and spiritual defeat not always being recognized, Mr. Leitzel, as twin sisters. We don\u0027t want to miss the main chance to grow in grace and—dear me!\" she pulled herself up. \"It sounds like Marcus Aurelius, doesn\u0027t it? Did you make his acquaintance at Harvard?\" \"Who?\" \"The Roman Emerson.\" \"Oh, but Emerson was a New Englander, not a Roman,\" he kindly set her right; \"known as the Sage of Concord, Massachusetts,\" he informed her, looking pleased with himself. Harriet in the front seat could not resist turning her head to meet for an instant Margaret\u0027s eye. \"I had to read a \u0027Life of Emerson\u0027 in my Sophomore year at Harvard,\" continued Daniel. \"Do you know that his writings never yielded him more than nine hundred dollars a year! Well educated as he was, he never made good. A dead failure. Missed the main chance, you see. Now I have always turned every circumstance and opportunity, no matter how trifling, to my own advantage. Why, from the time I first began to practise law, I refused to take any case that I didn\u0027t see I was surely going to win; so, in no time at all, I got a reputation for winning every case I took. See? I didn\u0027t take a case I didn\u0027t feel sure of winning. Good scheme, wasn\u0027t it? Well, that far-sighted policy reaped for me, very early in my career, a big harvest; for when I was just beginning to be known as the lawyer who never lost a case, there was, one night, a shocking crime committed in New Munich: a young girl, daughter of a carpenter, was supposed to have been foully and brutally murdered by her lover, the son of a petty grocer on one of our side streets. (My own residence is on Main Street, our principal resident street, a very fashionable street; house cost me twenty-five thousand!—one of the finest residences in the town—so considered by all.) Well, the evidence against the lover was overwhelming (I couldn\u0027t give you the details, Miss Berkeley, it would not be proper, you being a young, unmarried lady), and early on the morning after the murder the grocer came to see me on behalf of his son, begging me to take the case. He gave me all the facts and I saw very soon that the young man had not committed the crime. But I saw, also, that it would be very difficult to prove his innocence to a jury, and I knew the sentiment in the town to be furiously against the young man, especially among the women, so that I\u0027d be apt to make myself very unpopular if I took his case; and that even if I cleared him there would be many who would continue to think him guilty and to think that I had simply cheated the law by my cleverness; cheated moral justice, too, and left a foully murdered female go unavenged, all for the sake of a fee. So I, of course, refused to take the case, though the grocer, believing me to be the one lawyer who could clear his son (such was my growing reputation), offered me a very large fee; he was ready to mortgage his store and house if only I\u0027d take the case and save his son. The fee he offered certainly did make me hesitate; but you see, I was never one to let present profit blind me to future advantage. Most young men, less far-seeing and sharp, would have thought this a great opportunity to make a hit by clearing a falsely accused and perfectly innocent boy. But I saw much deeper into the situation, and so refused the case.\" \"Oh!\" Margaret cried. \"There you surely missed the \u0027main chance,\u0027 unless you afterward saw your mistake in time to change your mind.\" \"No, indeed, I didn\u0027t change my mind! And to show you how right I was in refusing the case, hear, now, of the immediate reward I reaped for my careful thoughtfulness. Hardly had the father left my office when a delegation of women of the U. B. Missionary Society (I am a member and liberal supporter of the U. B. Church of New Munich, my brother Hiram being an ordained U. B. minister) called at my office to protest against my taking the case for the young man\u0027s defence, the delegation including two very wealthy and prominent ladies. A false report had gone forth that I had taken the case. The ladies pointed out to me that I would be untrue to my Christian professions and unchivalrous to womanhood if for gold I stood up in court and defended the brutal murderer of an outraged, innocent female. \u0027Ladies,\u0027 I said to them, \u0027the case was offered to me, true; with a fee which some lawyers would have considered sufficient to justify their accepting even such a case as this. But, ladies, I refused to touch the case!\u0027 and, Miss Berkeley,\" said Daniel feelingly, a little quiver in his voice, \"I wish you could have seen the look of admiration on the faces of those ladies, especially on Miss Mamie Welchan\u0027s, one of the two unmarried members of the Missionary Society, daughter of Dr. Welchans, our leading physician. Well, I certainly had my reward! And that night the New Munich Evening Intelligencer came out with a long article commending my fearless and self-sacrificing devotion to duty; and the Missionary Society passed resolutions of gratitude to me in the name of Womanhood, as did also the Y.W.C.A., the Epworth League, the Girls\u0027 Friendly of the Episcopal Church (our most fashionable ladies are members of that Girls\u0027 Friendly), also several of the Christian Endeavour Societies of our town. You may imagine how glad I was I had refused the case. Just suppose I had accepted it!\" he said in reminiscent horror of such a false step. \"For, of course, I had not foreseen such an ovation as this. While I had seen the bad effects of accepting, I had not seen the good results of refusing it. Why, from that very hour, Miss Berkeley, my success was assured! You see, people believed, then, that I was conscientious, and they trusted me with their business, and my practice grew so fast that—well, it was only a few years before I rose to be the leading lawyer of New Munich, and a few more when I secured the cinch I\u0027ve got now.\" \"Was the young man hanged?\" asked Margaret in a low voice, not looking at him. \"Oh, he,\" returned Daniel, surprised and chagrined at her ignoring the real point of his story, which certainly had nothing to do with the fate of the young man; \"they failed to convict him, though every one believed him guilty. He had to leave New Munich.\" \"Couldn\u0027t you have proved his innocence?\" \"But, Miss Berkeley, don\u0027t you see I\u0027d have ruined myself if I had tried, and I made myself by refusing that case; I have always considered that episode the turning-point of my career, the pivot on which my success turned uppermost; my brother Hiram, who is a theologian, considered it Providential.\" \"\u0027Providential\u0027 that a young girl should be brutally murdered and a young man falsely accused so that you might—\u0027succeed?\u0027\" \"I should say, rather, that by the ruling of Providence the chance was given me to refuse the case and thereby win the enthusiastic approval and endorsement of the best class of our community.\" Margaret was silent. \"She isn\u0027t as bright as I had supposed she was,\" thought Daniel, disappointed at her want of admiration of his yarn. \"I wonder if she\u0027d bear me stupid children! If I thought so, I certainly wouldn\u0027t marry her.\" \"Early in my career,\" he, however, resumed his monologue, \"I took a stand for temperance. I\u0027m a total abstainer, Miss Berkeley, and I have found that on the whole it has been to my advantage, for besides being more economical, it has seemed more consistent with my Christian professions. To be sure, when the liquor men of our precinct practically offered to send me to Congress if I would uphold their interests, I did regret that I had taken such a decided stand for temperance that I couldn\u0027t becomingly diverge from it. I would have liked well enough to go to Congress. Jennie and Sadie would have liked, too, to have me a Congressman, and my brother Hiram thought if I were in Congress I could maybe work him in as chaplain of the Senate. He doesn\u0027t get a very big salary from his church at Millerstown, Pa., though he manages to live on it without touching his capital. But no! I told the liquor men I would not go back on the principles for which I had stood for so many years. You might think I was foolishly standing in my own light, Miss Berkeley, but I ask you, how would it have looked for a church member, a consistent, practical Christian, an upholder of and contributor to the Woman\u0027s Temperance union, to turn around and stand for the liquor interests? How would it have looked? Why,\" exclaimed Daniel, \"it would have looked pretty inconsistent, and I wouldn\u0027t risk it. Anyway, see what I saved in the past twenty years by not standing for treats? \u0027Come and have a drink on me,\u0027 says a grateful client, when I\u0027ve won his case for him, and I always say, \u0027I don\u0027t drink\u0027; but if I did drink, to be sure I\u0027d have to take my turn at the treats, too, don\u0027t you see, and that kind of thing does go into money. I\u0027ve saved a good income by standing for temperance, besides earning the approval of an excellent element in the community. But it isn\u0027t always easy to say, \u0027I don\u0027t drink.\u0027 Some men take offence at it, and some laugh at you. I\u0027ll never forget how embarrassed I was the first time Congressman Ocksreider\u0027s daughter invited me to a fashionable dinner at her home and they served wine. I didn\u0027t know how they\u0027d take it if I declined to drink, and I wanted to stand in with them. I was, at that time, very much complimented at their inviting me; they were the most prominent people in New Munich. And yet, sitting opposite me at the table, was a prominent member of the U. B. Church, who would certainly have a laugh on me if I took wine. He wasn\u0027t temperance. Now wasn\u0027t that a fix for me? My, but I was embarrassed! Well, Mrs. Congressman Ocksreider, a lady of very kind feelings, came to my help; the minute she saw how mixed-up I was, she told the waiter to pour grape juice into my glass. It\u0027s sickening stuff, but I was willing to drink it rather than forswear my principles right before my fellow church member. Yes, it takes moral courage, Miss Berkeley, to stand by your principles as I have always stood by mine. And now I see my further reward in sight, for look how things are swinging my way: temperance, Governors, Congressmen, Presidents! I may yet get to Congress on the local option issue. It looks that way.\" He paused to get his breath. Margaret made no comment on his long harangue, and Harriet did not turn her head. For a while they rode in silence. But at last Margaret, feeling it incumbent upon her to talk to her entertainer, roused herself from her rather unpleasant reverie. \"You spoke of two women, Mr. Leitzel—\u0027Jennie and Sadie\u0027—are they relatives of yours?\" \"My sisters who raised and educated me, who made me what I am!\" he replied in a tone of admiration for this remarkable feat his sisters had wrought. \"All I am I owe to them!\" \"They are to be congratulated.\" \"Thank you, Miss Berkeley.\" Daniel bowed. \"You\u0027re welcome, Mr. Leitzel. Shall we go home now? I feel ill.\" \"Motor riding makes you ill?\" inquired Daniel solicitously. \"Under some circumstances. To-day it does.\" Daniel at once gave the order to the chauffeur to return to Berkeley Hill. Harriet, on the front seat, wondered, as she stared thoughtfully at the long, straight road ahead of her, whether \"the game was up.\" \"I\u0027m afraid he\u0027s more of a dose than Margaret can swallow!\" she thought anxiously. When they reached home, however, she invited Mr. Leitzel to stop and dine with them. Margaret looked at her reproachfully as he eagerly accepted the invitation. It was two long hours before dinner time. \"You will have to excuse me. I shall have to go upstairs and lie down,\" Margaret hastily said as they entered the house; and before any one could reply, she flew upstairs and shut herself in her own room. Harriet, to her consternation, found herself with Mr. Leitzel on her hands—and Walter not due at home for an hour and a half! \"I\u0027ll have the children brought down,\" she quickly decided. \"That will help me out.\" Little did she dream that by this simple manoeuvre of introducing the children into the comedy she was turning the tide of her sister\u0027s life and settling her fate.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1853/53666.html","bookId":968,"book":{"id":968,"title":"Her Husband\u0027s Purse","description":"简介： The Pennsylvania town of New Munich was electrified by the sudden and entirely unlooked-for announcement of the betrothal of Daniel Leitzel, Esquire; but his two maiden sisters with whom he lived, and to whom the news was also wholly unexpected, were...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1853","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:04 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:04 AM"}}
