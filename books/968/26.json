{"id":42795,"no":26,"title":"Chapter 26","content":"Margaret bent all her energies to readjusting the household—her household now—in preparation for Walter\u0027s visit, to which she could, under these changed conditions, look forward with eager pleasure. But here again she ran upon a snag. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Every cloud has a silver lining,\" Daniel sentimentally remarked, preparatory to the discussion of the new furniture necessary to replace what his sisters had removed. \"You can now have your own things sent up from the Berkeley Hill home. Half of all that old mahogany, silver, rugs, books, and pictures. I couldn\u0027t afford to buy such valuable furniture as you\u0027ve got there. And solid silver, too.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Strip Berkeley Hill, my sister\u0027s home! and bring those things into this house!\" Margaret almost gasped. \"But don\u0027t you see, Daniel, this isn\u0027t the sort of house for old colonial furniture? It would be incongruous. What this house needs is early Victorian.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The freightage on your things won\u0027t come to nearly so much as new furniture would cost, even though we bought the grade of stuff the girls had here. And you can tell your sister Harriet that I\u0027ll pay for the crating and packing. It isn\u0027t right that I should, for they\u0027ve had the use of your things all this time, but you can tell her I\u0027m perfectly willing to do that. Or, never mind writing to her; we can arrange it with Walter when he comes.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n So strong was Margaret\u0027s sentiment for Berkeley Hill that it would have hurt her as much to see its familiar furnishings in this alien setting in New Munich as it would have hurt Harriet to strip her home. She did not, however, pursue the discussion with Daniel. Walter would be privately informed as to her wishes in the matter; and the places left bare by Jennie\u0027s and Sadie\u0027s departure would remain bare until Daniel saw fit to buy furniture to fill them. \\n\\n \\n\\n Meantime, she managed, though with difficulty, to prepare, with what furniture she had, a comfortable room for her brother-in-law. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If Daniel were poor, I\u0027d feel I ought to help him out, painful as it would be to me to see any part of Berkeley Hill installed here. But he doesn\u0027t need to be helped out. Far from it!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Daniel assumed Walter\u0027s visit to mean that at last this slow-moving Southerner had got round to the point of noticing his insistent demands for a settlement of Margaret\u0027s share in Berkeley Hill. So he awaited his arrival with much complacency. \\n\\n \\n\\n Walter Eastman reached New Munich at ten o\u0027clock one Wednesday morning and Margaret met him at the station. By the time Daniel came home to luncheon at one o\u0027clock the \"important Berkeley Hill business\" of which Walter had telegraphed was entirely concluded between him and Margaret, as were also a few other items of importance. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"For the present, Walter, I prefer not to tell Daniel about this news you have brought me,\" she suggested at the end of their interview, which, by the way, found her rather white and agitated. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But of course you understand, my dear,\" returned Walter, \"that you can\u0027t keep him in ignorance of it long?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Of course not. Just a few days. Perhaps not so long.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Any special reason for deferring such a pleasant announcement?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I want to spring it on him as a palliative, a sort of compensation, for something else which won\u0027t prove so pleasant.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ah, by the way,\" said Walter with apparent irrelevancy, crossing his long legs as they sat together on a sofa of the now very bare sitting-room, \"what was the meaning, Margaret, of all that bluff you put up on me about Western gold mines owned by a friend of yours who thought perhaps his step-mother had a legal claim, and so forth. Quite a case you made out!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s a true case. I\u0027m much interested in it. And Daniel\u0027s clerk happened to know that the land was vested in the step-mother\u0027s husband at the time of his death and that he died without a will. What I want you to tell me now is this: can any power on earth keep that widow from her one third interest in those coal—gold mines, if she claim her share?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, if she has never signed away her rights.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"She hasn\u0027t done that.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You say your husband\u0027s clerk was working on the case? Then it\u0027s the case of a client of his?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, the case of a client of his.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And a friend of yours, you said?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes. His clerk wasn\u0027t exactly working on it; she simply told me, when I asked her, that she knew the mining land to have been vested absolutely in the husband.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And you wrote me that the step-mother has not had her share because she\u0027s too ignorant to claim it, and that she\u0027s in want. That right?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I should say, then, no mercy should be shown those who have defrauded her. They should be made to pay up, especially as it was this old woman\u0027s hard labour and self-sacrifice in the first place (so you wrote) that saved the home and land for the family.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Tell me, Walter, dear, how shall the old woman set about getting her dues?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Simply hire a lawyer to bring suit.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But her religion forbids her to go to law.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then you\u0027re stumped. Nothing to be done.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But I\u0027ve learned that sometimes the New Mennonites allow some one else to bring suit for them.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Aha!\" laughed Walter. \"All right. Let her have her lawyer bring suit for her.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Can he surely recover her share?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Surely, if all the facts you\u0027ve given me are correct, her share can be reclaimed without a struggle.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m certain that all the facts I\u0027ve given you are correct.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You seem to be certain of a good deal about these far-distant acquaintances of whom I never heard, Margaret.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Margaret cast down her eyes, her face flushing; but after an instant: \"Thank you, Walter,\" she said. \"I\u0027m very much indebted to you. One more favour: kindly refrain from mentioning this case of the silver mines to Daniel.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Silver\u0027 mines?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Gold mines. Ah, here he comes now! And not a word, remember, of the news you\u0027ve brought me!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"All right, my dear.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And as for the furnishings of Berkeley Hill; sit tight and don\u0027t argue. Daniel always comes round to my way in the end, but it takes a bit of time and diplomacy.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Poor Daniel, he\u0027s like the rest of us, henpecked lot that we are!\" Walter teased her. \"He comes round to your way because he\u0027s got to; no escape! But if I know your Pennsylvania Dutch Daniel, Margaret, and his letters to me have been very self-revealing, he wishes sometimes that the good old wife-beating days were with us yet!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, Daniel isn\u0027t like that; he isn\u0027t a bit brutal—at least in the sense of rough. He\u0027s very gentle, really.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Daniel, now knowing his brother-in-law to be an impecunious and, by Leitzel standards, rather an incapable, unimportant sort of a man, manifested in his curt greeting of him the small esteem he felt for him. \\n\\n \\n\\n But he found, during his noon hour of respite, that his repeated efforts to talk business with this discounted individual were very skilfully parried. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We have a pretty big bill, Eastman, against that South Carolina estate,\" he began over his soup. \"A whole year\u0027s rent, you know, for Margaret\u0027s half of the house, land, and furniture. But Margaret is willing to waive that, in fact, quite willing, and I concur in her willingness. We shan\u0027t press that. We\u0027ll let that go, especially now that you\u0027ve come to settle up. If you\u0027d waited much longer, we might not have been so willing to waive the year\u0027s rent. Eh, Margaret?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Please, Daniel!\" Margaret murmured, hot with shame as she saw Walter\u0027s crimson embarrassment and rising anger. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, of course, I don\u0027t mean,\" said Daniel, who considered himself a remarkably tactful man, \"that Margaret would have gone so far as to bring suit. Not against her own sister, certainly. Nor would I, either, sanction such an extreme measure. But right is right, you know, and law is law.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ve got a case on my hands,\" retorted Walter, avoiding Margaret\u0027s eye, \"of a widow who for over thirty years has received no rent for her third share of some mines—oh, silver mines.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You ought to draw a big fee for a case like that!\" exclaimed Daniel, his eyes gleaming. \"A regular big haul; enough to set you up for life! Silver mines! Well, I should say!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t expect to get much out of it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027ll never get much out of anything,\" grumbled Daniel, \"the way you do business!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sometimes, however, business men are so extremely devoted to their own interests, to the exclusion of all human appeal and all natural ties, that their \u0027vaulting ambition o\u0027erleaps itself.\u0027\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ah, Shakespeare!\" nodded Daniel. \"Very aptly quoted. Yes, but the prudent, astute business man looks ahead and on all sides before he \u0027vaults.\u0027 I\u0027ve never taken one hasty, ill-considered step in my life. And look at the result! I\u0027ve a—a very comfortable living,\" he concluded, with a furtive glance at his wife. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The modern rule for getting rich,\" Walter, having quite recovered his equanimity, casually remarked, \"seems to be to skin other people.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ah, but you go about it too clumsily, my friend!\" returned Daniel, grinning. \"Don\u0027t try to skin people who have all the law and, I may say, all the brains on their side!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Walter stared. \"I try to skin people!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, it wouldn\u0027t be very civil of me, would it, when you are my guest at my own table, to accuse you of trying to skin my wife and me of her half of Berkeley Hill? I hope I am a man of too much tact to commit a breach of hospitality and etiquette like that! But this I will say——\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Margaret, however, seeing her husband to-day with Walter\u0027s eyes, was so swept with shame that she could not endure it. \"Daniel!\" she interposed, fearing that Walter, with Southern heat, would rise and slay her husband, \"do let me enjoy Walter for one day without bothering about business, won\u0027t you? Wait until to-night to talk things out.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"As I\u0027m obliged to get back to the office by two o\u0027clock, I suppose I shall have to wait until this evening. But I\u0027ve already waited over a year!\" said Daniel, glancing at Walter to note the embarrassment he expected his brother-in-law to feel at this thrust. \\n\\n \\n\\n But Walter was, by this time, beyond feeling anything but wonder and amusement at Leitzel\u0027s conversation, with, also, a sense of consternation at his fresh realization of poor Margaret\u0027s fate in being saddled to a \"mate\" like this, who, apparently, let her have none of the compensations which his huge wealth might have afforded her. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But you know,\" he trivially replied to Daniel\u0027s thrust, \"\u0027all things come to him who waits.\u0027 You waited pretty long for a wife, didn\u0027t you, Mr. Leitzel, and now you\u0027ve got one—very much so!—a hotheaded little Southerner, with ideals of chivalry and honour and honesty which I fear must make your hair stand up sometimes, you bloated capitalist! Yes, in these days, when a man marries, he finds himself very much married, eh, Leitzel?\" he inquired with a lightness which Daniel thought extremely unbecoming under the circumstances. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well,\" he retorted irritably, \"I\u0027ll admit that sometimes I do think I\u0027m a little too much married!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m afraid we\u0027ve lost the art of keeping them within their \u0027true sphere\u0027; they\u0027ve got rather beyond us in these days, haven\u0027t they?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They\u0027re not nearly so womanly as they used to be!\" said Daniel sullenly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But what are we going to do about it, poor shrimps that we are? Suppose, for instance, that a man\u0027s wife has a quixotic idea of honour, eccentric scruples about using money she thinks was not come by in quite an ideal way, what\u0027s a corporation lawyer going to do about it, if she sets up her will, eh?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There are the quite easy divorce courts,\" said Daniel darkly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But there is also alimony.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The marriage laws of our land,\" affirmed Daniel, \"ought to be revised.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They will be, as soon as women get the vote,\" said Walter. \"And then——\" \\n\\n \\n\\n But Margaret, fearing the lengths to which her brother-in-law might go in this reckless mood, brought the talk abruptly to an end. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s a quarter to two, Daniel. You\u0027ll be late to your office. I\u0027ll have dessert brought in at once. And you know it always takes you fifteen minutes to say good-bye to the children. It feels so grand, Walter, to refer to \u0027the children!\u0027 In the plural! I can\u0027t yet believe or realize it! And as for Daniel—well, he\u0027s a Comic Supplement, you know, about those twins,\" she rattled on, keeping the talk, during the remainder of the luncheon, away from thin ice. So that at last, when Daniel rose to go away, the suspicion roused by his brother-in-law\u0027s remarks had been brushed aside and lost sight of; for the time being, at least. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1853/53685.html","bookId":968,"book":{"id":968,"title":"Her Husband\u0027s Purse","description":"简介： The Pennsylvania town of New Munich was electrified by the sudden and entirely unlooked-for announcement of the betrothal of Daniel Leitzel, Esquire; but his two maiden sisters with whom he lived, and to whom the news was also wholly unexpected, were...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1853","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:04 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:04 AM"}}
