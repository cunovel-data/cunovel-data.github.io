{"id":42774,"no":5,"title":"Chapter 5","content":"Margaret\u0027s suddenly conceived passion for the young minister went through all the usual phases. It was not, of course, the individual himself, but her impossible inhuman ideal of him, of which she was enamoured, the man himself was as unknown to her as though she had never seen him; his image merely served as a dummy to be clothed with her rich imaginings. The thought of him dwelt with her every moment of the day, making her absent-minded and listless, or feverishly talkative. She made excuses to go frequently to town, to a dentist, to a doctor, to see Harriet, just for a chance to drive past the minister\u0027s parsonage, for even if she did not catch a glimpse of him, it was manna to her soul to look upon the place of his abode. She would have delighted to have lain her cheek upon the doorsill his foot had pressed. The actual sight, once or twice, of his ungainly figure on the street, set her heart to thumping so that she could not breathe. Her discovery, through a paragraph in the religious news of a daily paper, that he was married, did not affect her, for she was not conscious of any desire to marry him; she only wanted to see him, to hear him, to feel herself alive in all her being, in his presence. \n \n Even the sermon she managed to hear him preach one Sunday morning, when a visit from one of the scholarly gentlemen whom her uncle considered dangerous, gave her a free half day, even her recognition, through that sermon, of the man\u0027s mental barrenness, did not quench her passion. \n \n What did finally kill it, after three months of mingled misery and ecstasy, was an occasion as trivial as that which had given birth to it. One day, in front of a grocery shop, where some provisions were being piled into her phaeton, and where, to her quivering delight, the Object of her adoration just chanced at that moment to come to make some purchases, she heard him say to a negro employee of the grocer, \"Yes, sir, two pecks of potatoes and a head of cabbage; no, sir, no strawberries.\" \n \n To say \"sir\" to a negro! The scales fell from Margaret\u0027s eyes. Her heart settled down comfortably in her bosom. Her nerves became quiet. The young minister stood before her as he was. His Adam\u0027s apple was no longer a peculiar distinction, but an Adam\u0027s apple. For this was South Carolina. \n \n Thereafter, her uncle found her a much more comfortable companion. But keenly observant though he was, he had never suspected for a moment, during those three months of Margaret\u0027s obsession, that she was actually experiencing the thing he was so persistently trying to avert; for it would not have been conceivable to him that any woman, least of all his niece, Margaret Berkeley, could fall in love with \"a milksop\" like \"Rev. Hoops,\" as the poor man\u0027s printed visiting card proclaimed him. \n \n Never in all the rest of her life could Margaret laugh at that youthful ordeal. That she could have been so insanely deluded was a mystery to wonder over, to speculate about; but the passion itself, the depth, the height, the glory of it, its revelation of human nature\u0027s capacity for ecstasy—all this was a reality that would always be sacred to her. \n \n At the same time, her discovery that an emotional experience so intense and vital, so fundamental, could grow out of an absolute illusion and be so ephemeral, made her almost as cynical about love as was her uncle himself; so that always after that the seed of skepticism, which he so earnestly endeavoured to plant in her mind, fell on prepared soil. \n \n Had Margaret adopted indiscriminately her uncle\u0027s philosophical, ethical, social, political, or even literary ideas, it would certainly have unfitted her for living in a society so complacent, optimistic, and conventional as that of most American communities. As it was, the opinions she did come to hold, from her intercourse with this fearless, if pessimistic, thinker, and from her wide and varied reading with him, and also the ideals of life she formed in the solitude which gave her so much time for thought, were unusual enough to make her unique among women. One aspect of this difference from her kind was that she was entirely free from the false sentimentality of the average young woman, and this in spite of the fact that she was fervently imaginative and, in a high degree, sensitive to the beauty and poetry of life. Another and more radical point of difference was that she had what so very few women do have—spiritual and intellectual fearlessness. And both of these mental attitudes she owed not only to her own natural largeness of heart and mind, but to the strong bias given her by her uncle toward absolute honesty. \n \n While, by reason of her more than ordinary mentality, as well as because of a very adaptable disposition, Margaret bore her life of self-sacrifice and isolation with less unhappiness than most girls could have done, there was one phase of it which was vastly harder upon her. Her nature being unusually strong in its affections, it took hard schooling indeed before she could endure with stoicism the loveless life she led. It was upon her relation with her elder sister Harriet, the only human being who really belonged to her, that she tried to feed her starved heart, cherishing almost with passion this one living bond; idealizing her sister and her sister\u0027s love for her, looking with an intensity of longing to the time when she would be free to be with Harriet, to lavish upon her all her unspent love, to live in the happiness of Harriet\u0027s love for her. \n \n Harriet\u0027s lukewarmness, not manifest under her easy, good-natured bearing, was destined one day to come as a great shock to Margaret. \n \n It was one night about five months before her uncle\u0027s sudden death that he talked with her of his will. They were together in the library, waiting for Henry, the negro manservant, to finish his night\u0027s chores about the place before coming to help the master of the house to bed. \n \n \"I trust, Margaret,\" Berkeley, with characteristic abruptness, broke a silence that had fallen between them, \"that you are not counting on flourishing as an heiress when I have passed out?\" \n \n \"I must admit,\" said Margaret apologetically, \"that I never thought of that, stupid as it may seem to you, Uncle Osmond. Now that you mention it, it would be pleasant.\" \n \n \"\u0027Pleasant?\u0027 To have me die and leave you rich?\" \n \n \"I mean only the heiress part would be pleasant—and having English dukes marrying me, you know, and all that.\" \n \n \"How many English dukes, pray? I fancy they are a high-priced commodity, and my fortune isn\u0027t colossal.\" \n \n \"I shouldn\u0027t want a really colossal fortune.\" \n \n \"Modest of you. But,\" he added, \"if I did mean to do you the injury of leaving you all I have, it would be more than enough to spoil what is quite too rare and precious for spoiling\"—he paused, his keen eyes piercing her as he deliberately added—\"a very perfect woman.\" \n \n \"Meaning me?\" Margaret asked with wide-eyed astonishment. \n \n \"So I don\u0027t intend to leave you a dollar.\" \n \n \"Suit yourself, honey.\" \n \n \"You are like all the Berkeleys, entirely lacking in money sense. Now the lack of money sense is refreshing and charming, but disastrous. I shall not leave my money to you for four reasons.\" He counted them off on his long, emaciated fingers. \"First, because you wouldn\u0027t be sufficiently interested in the damned money to take care of it; secondly, you\u0027d give it away to your sister, or to her husband, or to your own husband, or to any one that knew how to work you; thirdly, riches are death to contentment and to usefulness and the creator of parasitism; fourthly, I wish you to be married for your good, sweet self, my dear child, and not for my money.\" \n \n \"But if I\u0027m penniless, I may have to marry for money. From what you tell me of love, money is the only thing left to marry for. And if it has to be a marriage for money, I prefer to be the one who has the money, if you please, Uncle Osmond.\" \n \n \"Well, you won\u0027t get mine. I tell you you are worth too much to be turned into one of these parasitical women who are the blot on our modern civilization. In no other age of the world has there been such a race of feminine parasites as at the present. Let me tell you something, Margaret: there is just one source of pure and unadulterated happiness in life, and that I bequeath to you in withholding from you my fortune. Congenial work, my girl, is the only sure and permanent joy. Love? Madness and anguish. Family affection? Endless anxiety, heartache, care. You are talented, child; discover what sort of work you love best to do, fit yourself to do it pre?minently well, and you\u0027ll be happy and contented.\" \n \n \"But my gracious! Uncle Osmond, what chance have I to fit myself for an occupation, out here at Berkeley Hill, taking care of you? These years of my youth in which I might be preparing for a career I\u0027m devoting to you, my dear. So I really think it would only be poetic justice for you to leave me your money, don\u0027t you?\" \n \n Her uncle, looking as though her words had startled and surprised him, did not answer her at once. Considering her earnestly as she sat before him, the firelight shining upon her dark hair and clear olive skin, the peculiar expression of his gaze puzzled Margaret. \n \n \"That,\" he said slowly, \"is an aspect of your case I had not considered.\" \n \n \"Of course you had not; it wouldn\u0027t be at all like you to have considered it, my dear.\" \n \n \"Well,\" he snapped, \"my will is made. I\u0027m leaving all I have, except this place, for the founding of a college which shall be after my idea of a college. Berkeley Hill, however, must, of course, remain in the family.\" \n \n \"Don\u0027t, for pity\u0027s sake, burden the family (that\u0027s Harriet and me) with Berkeley Hill, Uncle Osmond, if you don\u0027t give us the wherewithal to keep it up and pay the taxes on it!\" protested Margaret. \n \n Again her uncle gazed at her with an enigmatical stare. \"Huh!\" he muttered, \"you\u0027ve got some money sense after all. More than any Berkeley I ever met.\" \n \n \"I know this much about money,\" she said sententiously: \"that while poverty can certainly rob us of all that is worth while in life, wealth can\u0027t buy the two essentials to happiness—love and good health.\" \n \n \"Since when have you taken to making epigrams?\" \n \n \"Why, that is an epigram, isn\u0027t it! Good enough for a copybook.\" \n \n \"I tell you, girl, if I leave you rich, I rob you of the necessity to work, and that is robbing you of life\u0027s only worth. The most pitiable wretches on the face of the earth are idle rich women.\" \n \n \"If it\u0027s all the same to you, Uncle Osmond, I\u0027d rather take my chances for happiness with riches than without them.\" \n \n \"I am to understand, then, that you actually have the boldness to tell me to my face that you expect me to leave to you all I die possessed of?\" \n \n \"Yes, please.\" \n \n \"It\u0027s wonderfully like your damned complacency! Well, as I\u0027ve told you, I\u0027ve already made my will.\" \n \n \"Here\u0027s Henry to take you upstairs. But you can make it over, or add a codicil. Which shall I bring you to-night, an eggnog or beer?\" \n \n \"I\u0027m sick of all your slops. Let me alone.\" \n \n \"Yes, dear. Good-night,\" she answered with the perfunctory, artificial pleasantness which she always employed, as per contract, in responding to his surliness; and the absurdity, as well as the audacity, of that bought-and-paid-for cheerfulness of tone, never failed to entertain the old misanthrope. \n \n Five months later the will which Osmond Berkeley\u0027s lawyer read to the \"mourners\" gave Berkeley Hill to Margaret and her sister, Mrs. Walter Eastman, while all the rest of the considerable estate was left to a board of five trustees to be used for the founding of a college in which there should be absolute freedom of thought in every department, such a college as did not then exist on the face of the earth. \n \n Harriet\u0027s husband, being a lawyer, offered at once to secure for Margaret, through process of law, a reasonable compensation for her eight years of service. But Margaret objected. \n \n \"You see Uncle Osmond didn\u0027t wish me to have any of his money, Walter.\" \n \n \"Don\u0027t be sentimental about it, Margaret. Your uncle had a lot of sentiment, didn\u0027t he, about your sacrificing your life for him?\" \n \n \"He had his reasons for not giving me his money. He sincerely thought it would be better for me not to have it. He really did have some heart for me, Walter. I\u0027m not sentimental, but I couldn\u0027t touch a dollar he didn\u0027t wish me to have.\" \n \n \"Then you certainly are sentimental,\" Walter insisted. \n \n Almost immediately after the funeral Harriet and her family moved out from Charleston to live at Berkeley Hill with Margaret, retaining the two old negroes who for so many years had done all the work that was done on the estate. \n \n \"We couldn\u0027t rent the place without spending thousands in repairing it, so we\u0027ll have to live on it ourselves.\" \n \n The sentiment that Margaret and Harriet cherished for this old homestead which had for so long been occupied by some branch of the family was so strong as to preclude any idea of selling the place. \n \n It was Margaret\u0027s wish, at this time, to go away from Berkeley Hill and earn her own living, as much for the adventure of it as because she thought she ought not to be a burden to Walter. But the Southerner\u0027s principle that a woman may with decency work for her living only when bereft of all near male kin to earn it for her led Walter to protest earnestly against her leaving their joint home. \n \n Harriet, too, was at first opposed to it. \n \n \"You could be such a help and comfort to me, Margaret, dear, if you\u0027d stay. Henry and Chloe are too old and have too much work to do on this huge place to help me with the children; and out here I can\u0027t do as I did in Charleston—get in some one to stay with the babies whenever I want to go anywhere. So you see how tied down I\u0027d be. But with you here, I should always feel so comfortable about the children whenever I had to be away from them.\" \n \n \"But for what it would cost Walter to support me, Harriet, dear, you could keep a nurse for the children.\" \n \n \"And spend half my time at the Employment Agency. A servant would leave as soon as she discovered how lonesome it is out here, a half mile from the trolley line. It\u0027s well Henry and Chloe are too attached to the place to leave it.\" \n \n \"So the advantage of having me rather than a child\u0027s nurse is that I\u0027d be a fixture?\" Margaret asked, hiding with a smile her inclination to weep at this only reason Harriet had to urge for her remaining with her. \n \n \"Of course you\u0027ll be a fixture,\" Harriet answered affectionately. \"Walter and I are only too glad to give you a home.\" \n \n So, for nearly a year after her uncle\u0027s death, Margaret continued to live at Berkeley Hill. \n \n Harriet always referred to their home as \"My house,\" \"My place,\" and never dreamed of consulting her younger sister as to any changes she saw fit to make in the rooms or about the grounds. \n \n It was during these first weeks of Margaret\u0027s life with Harriet that she suffered the keen grief of finding her own warm affection for her sister thrown back upon itself in Harriet\u0027s want of enthusiasm over their being together; her always cool response to Margaret\u0027s almost passionate devotion; her abstinence from any least approach to sisterly intimacy and confidence. It was not that Harriet disliked Margaret or meant to be cold to her. It was only that she was constitutionally selfish and indifferent. \n \n So, in the course of time, Margaret came to lavish all the thwarted tenderness of her heart upon her sister\u0027s three very engaging children. \n \n But before that first year of her new life had passed over her head she came to feel certain conditions of it to be so unbearable that, in spite of Walter\u0027s protests (only Walter\u0027s this time), she made a determined effort to get some self-supporting employment. And it was then that she became aware of a certain fact of modern life of which her isolation had left her in ignorance: she discovered that in these days of highly specialized work there was no employment of any sort to be obtained by the untrained. School teachers, librarians, newspaper women, even shopgirls, seamstresses, cooks, and housemaids must have their special equipment. And Margaret had no money with which to procure this equipment. There is, perhaps, no more tragic figure in our strenuous modern life than the penniless woman of gentle breeding, unqualified for self-support. \n \n The worst phase of Margaret\u0027s predicament was that it had become absolutely impossible for her to continue to live longer under the same roof with Walter and Harriet. The simple truth was, Harriet was jealous of Walter\u0027s quite brotherly affection for her—for so Margaret interpreted his kindly attitude toward her. Having no least realization of her own unusual maidenly charm, the fact that her brother-in-law was actually fighting a grande passion for her would have seemed to her grotesque, incredible; for Walter, being a Southern gentleman, controlled his feelings sufficiently to treat her always with scrupulous consideration and courtesy. Therefore, she considered Harriet\u0027s jealousy wholly unreasonable. Why, her sister seemed actually afraid to trust the two of them alone in the house together! (Margaret did not dream that Walter was afraid to trust himself alone in the house with her.) And if by chance Harriet ever found them in a tête-à-tête, she would not speak to Margaret for days, and as Walter, too, was made to take his punishment, Margaret was sure he must wish her away. Of course, since she had become a cause for discord and unhappiness between Harriet and Walter, she must go. A way must be found for her to live away from Berkeley Hill. \n \n It was this condition of things which she faced the night she lay on the couch in her sister\u0027s room keeping guard over her sleeping children while Harriet and Walter were seeing Nazimova in \"Hedda Gabler.\" \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1853/53664.html","bookId":968,"book":{"id":968,"title":"Her Husband\u0027s Purse","description":"简介： The Pennsylvania town of New Munich was electrified by the sudden and entirely unlooked-for announcement of the betrothal of Daniel Leitzel, Esquire; but his two maiden sisters with whom he lived, and to whom the news was also wholly unexpected, were...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1853","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:04 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:04 AM"}}
