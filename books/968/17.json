{"id":42786,"no":17,"title":"Chapter 17","content":"In spite of the forbearance which Margaret felt she had exercised in her desire to be scrupulously considerate of Daniel and his sisters in everything pertaining to the party, the night of this much-advertised \"social event\" found her in serious disfavour not only with her sisters-in-law, but with her husband himself; first, because of her persistence in ignoring their dictation as to the sort of gown she should wear; secondly, their discovery that she was taking daily walks with Miss Hamilton; for though Margaret would not stoop to any secrecy as to her relation with Daniel\u0027s secretary, yet she had not gone out of her way to publish it, and so the walks had been going on for some time before her three monitors learned of them; thirdly, the exception they had taken to her telling some callers, by whose patronage they felt honoured, that she could not afford a new set of furs! Mrs. Ocksreider had spoken admiringly of the furs she had seen Margaret wearing one day and had asked where she had bought them, and Margaret had replied that she had never bought any furs in her life; that she had always been too poor (Danny\u0027s wife admitting poverty!), and that these furs had been her grandmother\u0027s!—telling Mrs. Ocksreider, of all people, that she wore her grandmother\u0027s old clothes! \n \n But Mrs. Ocksreider\u0027s reply had been puzzling to Jennie and Sadie: \n \n \"Oh, but my dear Mrs. Leitzel, to have had a grandmother who wore sable! It ought to admit you to the D.A.R\u0027s! No wonder you flaunt them and refuse to buy new ones!\" \n \n Then Margaret had further mortified them before this same formidable social leader of New Munich by refusing her invitation to join the Women\u0027s Auxiliary of the Episcopal Church, which, as Jennie and Sadie well knew, was made up of New Munich\u0027s \"leading society ladies\"; so what was their horror to hear Margaret reply, \"It\u0027s very charitable of you to fancy that I\u0027d be of the least use to you. But I\u0027ve always hated Women\u0027s Auxiliaries!\" And she said it with such a musical drawl that Mrs. Ocksreider, instead of showing how offended she must be, had laughed as though she found it funny. But the idea of saying you hated Women\u0027s Auxiliaries! It was next thing to saying that you hated the Bible! Never had Jennie and Sadie experienced such a painful half-hour as that of this call. \n \n Fourthly, Daniel\u0027s sisters had at last discovered, through persistent prying, that his wife did not have an independent income; and Margaret, her wits sharpened by her new environment to recognize things at first unthinkable to her, saw that this discovery made Jennie and Sadie feel more free than ever to dictate to her and interfere with her liberty. \n \n All these little episodes combining to bring upon her the displeasure of the household, the night of the party found her in a not very cheerful frame of mind, though the deep satisfaction that was hers in the great friendship that had come into her life, the most vital human relation that she had ever known, made it impossible for these smaller things to disturb her fundamentally, as otherwise they might have done. \n \n There had been one event of that day that had somewhat brightened for her the gloom of the home atmosphere: a belated wedding-gift had come from Daniel\u0027s step-mother—a patchwork quilt—accompanied by a letter addressed to Daniel and his wife, written for the old woman by the district school teacher. \n \n \"\u0027It\u0027s a very humble present I am sending you,\u0027\" Daniel had read the letter aloud at the breakfast table. \"\u0027But it\u0027s the work of my old hands, dear children, the last I\u0027ll ever do—and the love of my heart went into every stitch of it. I was so proud that you sent me such a notice of your wedding; to remember your old mother, Danny, when you were so happy yourself. I\u0027ve been working on the quilt ever since I got the notice about the wedding already, and now I\u0027d like so well to see your wife, Danny. I\u0027ll try, if I am strong enough, to take the train in, one of these days, and see you both. I\u0027ll come back the same day so as not to make any of you any extra work or trouble. I would like to see the lady you married, Danny, before I die, and give her an old woman\u0027s wishes for a happy, useful life with my good son that I am so proud of. I wish I could live long enough to see your first baby, Danny, but I guess it won\u0027t be many months any more before I must go to my long home.\u0027\" \n \n \"Yes, that\u0027s always the way she talks—she \u0027hasn\u0027t long to live\u0027 just to work on our feelings so as to make us give her more!\" Jennie commented. \"She has no need to come in here to see Margaret. She makes herself very bold to offer to. And she can\u0027t spare the car fare, little as what she has to go on. What\u0027s Margaret to her anyhow? And she\u0027s likely to be too feeble to get back if she comes in. Then we\u0027d have her on our hands yet!\" \n \n But Margaret had spent an hour of the morning in writing to Mrs. Leitzel, acknowledging her gift, telling her how glad she would be to see one who had done so much for Daniel when he was a boy. For their step-mother\u0027s self-sacrificing devotion to them all in their childhood had been made known to Margaret through many an unwitting, significant remark dropped in her presence. She concluded her letter: \n \n \n I am coming out to see you very soon, certainly some day next week. Daniel will bring me if he has time. If not, I\u0027ll go myself. Until then; with my heartfelt thanks for the work of your dear hands, which I shall use with pride and with grateful thoughts of you, \n \n I am your affectionate daughter, \n MARGARET BERKELEY LEITZEL. \n \n \n All that day, through the constant little rasping antagonisms which Margaret, despite her good intentions, seemed unable to avert in any intercourse between herself and the Leitzels, she felt that consolatory bit of kindness and good will which had come to her from the old woman in the country. And when she stood at night with her husband and his sisters to receive their guests (Sadie in pink satine) the friendly spirit of her aged mother-in-law was with her still in the background of her consciousness, softening the light of her eyes and making human the perfunctory smile of her lips as she repeated her conventional formula of greeting over and over; so that people marvelled at the apparent continued tranquillity of this incongruously assorted household. \n \n When later in the evening Margaret was free to move about among her guests, Daniel\u0027s cold displeasure with her was greatly modified as he witnessed again to-night, as on many previous occasions, how attractive she undoubtedly was to the men of his world. His uncannily keen little eyes read in the faces of his male guests, as they approached and talked with Margaret, the covetousness they felt for this rare possession of his. No acquisition of all his acquisitive career had ever given him a more delectable joy than his realization of the worth, in other men\u0027s eyes, of his charming wife. \n \n Had he overheard the view of her which was ventilated, though surreptitiously, by some of the guests over their supper, his satisfaction might have been somewhat modified. \n \n \"I think she\u0027s a scream!\" declared Myrtle Deibert to the group at her table. \"Did you hear what she said to me as we were leaving the Country Club dance last Wednesday evening, when I remarked to her, \u0027Your husband is so awfully in love with you, Mrs. Leitzel; just see how he is beaming on you from clear across the room!\u0027 \u0027Scowling at me, you mean,\u0027 she corrected me. \u0027Don\u0027t you hear our taxicab registering out there while I linger to talk to you?\" \n \n This anecdote was met with a shout of laughter, the point of which would certainly have remained obscure to Daniel Leitzel. \n \n \"Of course you all heard of her telling mother,\" said Miss Ocksreider, \"that she hated Women\u0027s Auxiliaries? And that she wore her grandmother\u0027s old furs because she couldn\u0027t afford to buy new ones? Mother says\"—she lowered her voice and the group at the table closed in a bit closer to catch her words—\"that it was a perfect circus to see the consternation of Miss Jennie and Miss Sadie when she said she was poor. Isn\u0027t it queer how they are so proud of their money and yet so afraid to spend it?\" \n \n \"Did you hear,\" inquired Mrs. Eshelman, \"what Mrs. Leitzel said to me last Sunday after church when I told her I\u0027d put a five-dollar gold piece on the collection plate in mistake for a nickel and I had half a mind to ask the usher to let me have it back. \u0027You might as well,\u0027 she said, \u0027for you know the Lord won\u0027t give you credit for more than five cents.\u0027\" \n \n \"She certainly does go to the ragged edge,\" Mr. Eshelman added his quota; \"I asked her this evening whether she had been to hear the evangelist\u0027s address to Women Only, and she said no, what she wanted to hear was a talk to Men Only!\" \n \n \"What do you think she said to me when I told her,\" said Mrs. Hostetter, \"what a bad boy the son of the Presbyterian pastor is. \u0027This proverbial badness of minister\u0027s children,\u0027 she said, \u0027is often, I think, just the hypocrisy of the minister breaking out.\u0027 \u0027But all ministers are not hypocrites,\u0027 I said to her, shocked. \u0027Of course, unconsciously hypocrites,\u0027 she answered. \u0027They don\u0027t deceive any one else as they deceive themselves.\u0027 Isn\u0027t she queer?\" added Mrs. Hostetter, genuinely puzzled. \n \n \"She\u0027s a peach!\" declared Mr. Hostetter. \n \n \"Danny must think so,\" declared Mr. Eshelman, \"to open up like this in her honour!\" indicating the elaborate supper provided by the city caterer. \"Terrapin, mind you, at Danny Leitzel\u0027s!\" \n \n \"And the \u0027floral decorations!\u0027\" breathed Miss Deibert with an appreciative glance at the roses and palms that decorated the dining-room. \"It doesn\u0027t seem possible, does it?\" \n \n \"This party is costing Danny something!\" grinned Hostetter. \n \n \"And to think,\" said Mrs. Hostetter, \"that Dan Leitzel has married a penniless bride—as she certainly gives it out that she is! It doesn\u0027t seem possible.\" \n \n \"The power of one little woman!\" said Mr. Hostetter pensively. \"I tell you that girl\u0027s eyes, and her voice, and her figger, and her teeth and lips, would melt any man\u0027s heart, even one of flint like Dan Leitzel\u0027s!\" \n \n \"That will do, Jacob!\" stiffly admonished Mrs. Hostetter. \n \n \"Will you look at that blue glass owl on the sideboard,\" said Miss Ocksreider. \"Wouldn\u0027t you think Mrs. Leitzel would have removed it before this party?\" \n \n \"She wouldn\u0027t dare! Miss Jennie thinks it\u0027s choice!\" responded Mrs. Eshelman. \"She got it ten years ago at the ninety-nine-cent store for Danny\u0027s Christmas present, and she told me at the time that she knew it was an awful price to pay for a mere pitcher, but that they needed a handsome ornament for the top of their sideboard. No, indeed, Mrs. Leitzel wouldn\u0027t dare discard that old owl!\" \n \n \"How she manages to steer her way peaceably among the three members of this household!\" murmured Miss Deibert. \n \n \"She\u0027s a wonder!\" \n \n \"And she certainly knows how to keep her opinions to herself,\" said Mrs. Hostetter. \"No one gets a word out of her as to what she thinks of her in-laws!\" \n \n \"Then she is a wonder!\" volunteered Hostetter. \n \n \"Wouldn\u0027t I like to be her father confessor!\" exclaimed Miss Deibert. \"I don\u0027t know what I wouldn\u0027t give for an X-ray view of her mind!\" \n \n It was a curious fact that the only person present at the Leitzels\u0027 notable party who was quite unimpressed by the expensiveness of the affair was Margaret herself. \n \n What did impress her, as she chatted with her guests and ate her supper, was the subtlety with which one can be penetrated by the spiritual atmosphere of a given group; she felt so acutely that of this gathering to-night as compared with the fine aroma of any social collection of her Southern environment, with its old inherited simplicity and culture. She had thought, in the first weeks of her New Munich life, that the difference must be only external, for she was not only democratically disposed by nature, but the rather socialistic theories with which her uncle had imbued her inclined her to a large view of any social discrepancies. \n \n To-night, however, it was borne in upon her that she was an alien in this company; that she could more readily find a real point of contact and sympathy with the plainest sort of day-labouring people; with, for instance, the Leitzels\u0027 cook, who was at least genuine and not pretentious, than with these people who knew no ideals except those of material possession and whose purpose in life seemed to be, on the part of the women, to outshine their acquaintances and kill time; and on that of the men to make money enough to allow the women to pursue this useful and exalted career. \n \n \"People who are poor enough to be obliged to work,\" she spoke out her reflections to the lawyer, Henry Frantz, who happened to be sipping coffee with her, \"have really purer and more wholesome views of life than—than we have\" (she indicated, by a turn of her hand, the company at large). \"I begin to understand, Mr. Frantz, why, in the history of nations, we see decay set in just as soon as a climax of prosperity has been reached. To survive the deadening influence of great wealth, well, it\u0027s only the fittest among nations and individuals who are strong enough to do it, isn\u0027t it?\" \n \n \"But it is only where there is a leisure class that we find art and culture,\" suggested Mr. Frantz. \n \n \"The great minds and the great characters of the world, however, have never come from an environment of wealthy leisure. In our own country, has any one of our really great Presidents been educated in private schools? Nearly every citizen of eminent usefulness is a public school product.\" \n \n \"A notable exception—your husband,\" he replied. \n \n \"\u0027Citizen of eminent usefulness,\u0027\" she musingly experimented with her phrase. \"Would Mr. Leitzel come under that head?\" \n \n \"He\u0027s a lawyer of state-wide, if not national, reputation, Mrs. Leitzel.\" \n \n \"I know. Are they an eminently useful class—corporation lawyers? I merely ask for information. My ignorance on most subjects is unfathomable.\" \n \n \"Well, we couldn\u0027t get along without them.\" \n \n \"Corporations couldn\u0027t. But aren\u0027t we beginning to think we could get along without corporations?\" \n \n \"Boneheads may think so. It is civilization that has built up corporations, and every time a corporation is dissolved we take a backward step in civilization.\" \n \n \"If public utilities,\" said Margaret dogmatically, quoting her Uncle Osmond, \"were conducted for the benefit not of corporations, but by the Government for the benefit of the whole people, we\u0027d have a full treasury without taxing the people.\" \n \n Mr. Frantz looked at her and broke into irrepressible laughter. \"Excuse me, Mrs. Leitzel, but that anything looking so girlish and pretty, that anything even remotely associated with my good friend Danny Leitzel, should be giving out remarks like that—well, it\u0027s a little too much for me, you see! Did you and my friend Danny exchange views on social economics before you were married?\" \n \n \"We didn\u0027t have time to exchange views on anything. We knew each other just six weeks before we were married.\" \n \n \"And have been getting acquainted since?\" \n \n \"I\u0027m inclined to think a six weeks\u0027 acquaintance just as good as a lifetime one for finding out what kind of a mate your lover is going to make.\" \n \n \"Exactly. No good at all, eh?\" \n \n \"Not much,\" she smiled. \n \n \"I wonder,\" speculated Mr. Frantz, eying her curiously, \"if there was ever a married pair whose ideal of each other grew higher after marriage. Think so?\" \n \n \"Surely. Their lives being a daily unfolding of new beauties and excellences to each other.\" \n \n \"Oh, but I\u0027m afraid you\u0027re a sentimentalist.\" \n \n \"Southerners generally are, but they\u0027re saved, you know, by their unfailing sense of humour,\" she responded, turning from him to give some attention to the man seated on the other side of her at the little supper table. \n \n Mrs. Leitzel\u0027s adroitness in avoiding thin ice was the despair of the gossips of New Munich. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1853/53676.html","bookId":968,"book":{"id":968,"title":"Her Husband\u0027s Purse","description":"简介： The Pennsylvania town of New Munich was electrified by the sudden and entirely unlooked-for announcement of the betrothal of Daniel Leitzel, Esquire; but his two maiden sisters with whom he lived, and to whom the news was also wholly unexpected, were...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1853","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:04 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:04 AM"}}
