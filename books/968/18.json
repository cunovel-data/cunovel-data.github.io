{"id":42787,"no":18,"title":"Chapter 18","content":"Margaret\u0027s radiant happiness in the discovery she made on the very day after the party, that she was embarked on the wonderful passage to motherhood, fraught with its strangely mingled suffering and bliss, was somewhat tempered by the consciousness that the coming child would have to be a Leitzel; there was no escaping that catastrophe. She tried to persuade herself that the Leitzel characteristics, if properly educated, might not be so very lamentable; but her deep-down conviction that her child ran the risk of inheriting a small, mean soul gave her no little anxiety and self-reproach. \n \n \"My penalty for trying to compromise with life\u0027s austerities!\" she grimly told herself with sad misgiving. \n \n Her husband\u0027s joy and pride in the prospect of being a father consoled her somewhat, it was so human and normal of him; though even here the taint of greed entered in, he was so inordinately pleased that his money would not have to be left to Hiram\u0027s children. \n \n Indeed, during the earlier weeks of her pregnancy, Margaret tried hard to keep her mind off the topics discussed in the bosom of the family, so fearful was she of the effect, upon her child, of her own recoil from the Leitzel view of life. \n \n She found that they never would get done talking about the cost of that party; it was evidently going to occupy them for the rest of their mortal lives. The worst of it was they so insisted upon impressing it upon her. \n \n \"Hiram never spent that much for a party for his Lizzie, and she brought her husband thirty thousand dollars. It ain\u0027t many husbands that would so spend for a wife that—well, don\u0027t you think, too, Margaret, that Danny\u0027s awful generous considering?\" \n \n \"Considering what, Jennie?\" \n \n \"Ach, Margaret, don\u0027t be so dumb! Considering you ain\u0027t got anything.\" \n \n \"Oh, yes, I have something—youth and health and intelligence and good temper. I\u0027m a prize. Daniel thinks so.\" \n \n \"But you see,\" interposed Sadie, \"our Danny could have had any of our rich town girls here.\" \n \n \"And yet preferred me. His good taste. The only instance of it I\u0027ve ever noticed.\" \n \n She knew the puzzled despair of her husband\u0027s sisters over their inability to make her humbly grateful for that she, a penniless bride, had been \"chosen\" by their brother. But that she should fail to appreciate the expenditure for the party given in her honour was too much. \n \n \"Why, Danny\u0027s bills come to three hundred dollars yet!\" Jennie told her with heat. \"And Sadie ain\u0027t well yet from over-eating that rich supper we had that night off of the Philadelphia caterer!\" \n \n \"Yes, I feel it yet,\" said Sadie plaintively. \"Just to think, Margaret, that Danny spent three hundred dollars for the party for you!\" \n \n \"Did he get off so easily as that? The flowers were so abundant and the supper so nice, I would have supposed they would have cost more than that, if I had thought about the cost.\" \n \n \"Well, why didn\u0027t you think about the cost, when it was all for you?\" \n \n \"I didn\u0027t think about it, my dears, because the cost of things doesn\u0027t interest me; I have so many more interesting things to think about. This, for instance,\" she said, holding up the dainty baby dress on which she had been sewing as they all sat together in the sitting-room, awaiting Daniel\u0027s coming home to his noon dinner. \n \n \"But it\u0027s a wife\u0027s place to——\" \n \n Daniel\u0027s entrance cut short Jennie\u0027s admonitions. The dinner-table talk, however, scarcely relieved the tension on Margaret\u0027s nerves. \n \n Daniel was always expansive as to his business \"deals\" when he felt complacent, and to-day his state of mind was one of unusual satisfaction, for just before dinner Margaret had displayed to him (surreptitiously, to spare the virgin squeamishness of Jennie and Sadie) the baby things upon which she had been working, and his delight in them was like unto that of a woman. He was therefore talkative and confidential over his roast beef. \n \n \"Well, Margaret, you can be proud of the way your husband upholds Christian principles in this community. I received in my morning\u0027s mail a letter from the Board of Managers of the Y.W.C.A. thanking me for the stand I took at the meeting yesterday afternoon of the stockholders of the Country Club on the question of Sunday sports. Some of the men want tennis and golf allowed on Sunday, but I stand for the sanctity of the Sabbath, and I wouldn\u0027t give in one inch. I\u0027m the biggest stockholder of the club and they can\u0027t go against my vote in anything. I may say I rule the Country Club. One fellow, Abe Meyers, got up and declared he\u0027d organize a new country club before he\u0027d \u0027submit to the tyranny of one hidebound Pharisee!\u0027 What do you think of that?\" chuckled Daniel. \"\u0027The tyranny of one hidebound Pharisee!\u0027 Sour grapes, of course. He hasn\u0027t the cash or the influence to organize another club. I told them that so long as I was a member of that club, the sanctity of the Sabbath should be preserved. Golf and tennis six days of the week, but on the Sabbath, no sports; and I said I knew I had behind me the support of our Christian community. You see, Margaret, if I withdrew, the club couldn\u0027t go on.\" \n \n \"That very fact,\" said Margaret, her voice rather weak, \"ought, I should think, make you unwilling to impose your theories upon the other members. Noblesse oblige, you know.\" \n \n But Daniel was incapable of seeing this point of view. \n \n \"The evening papers,\" he continued, his eyes gleaming with satisfaction, \"will give a full account of the meeting yesterday and publish, also, the letter of thanks sent to me by the Y.W.C.A. I handed that letter to a reporter of the Intelligencer. You\u0027ll see it in to-night\u0027s paper, Margaret.\" \n \n \"Oh!\" breathed Jennie and Sadie, awe and admiration in their tones, and worship in the glances sent across the table to Daniel. \"Here, Emmy,\" Jennie ordered the maid, \"don\u0027t you see Mr. Danny\u0027s milk glass is empty? Fill it up. Do you like these pickles, Danny? They\u0027re the first I opened yet.\" \n \n \"They\u0027re of just precisely the degree of sourness I like,\" Daniel nodded approvingly. \n \n \"Danny\u0027s so much for sour,\" Jennie informed Margaret. \"Yes, you took notice already, I guess, how he eats sour all the time at his meals, even up to his pie. I have to put up a lot of pickles and Chili sauce and chow-chow for him. Ain\u0027t, Danny? And he says no one\u0027s sour tastes so good to him as what mine does. I don\u0027t know what he would do,\" she said in consternation, \"if I was taken and he couldn\u0027t have his sour any more.\" \n \n \"There\u0027s Heinz\u0027s fifty-seven varieties,\" said Margaret. \n \n \"Heinz!\" scoffed Jennie. \"Our Danny eat that Heinz stuff, used as he is to good home-made sour! Well, Margaret, you don\u0027t mean to tell me you\u0027d feed that to our Danny! I\u0027d turn in my grave!\" \n \n \"I\u0027d \u0027feed him\u0027 Heinz\u0027s fifty-seven varieties and tell him I\u0027d made them myself; a plan, you see, which would make Daniel happy while it saved my time and energies for something more useful than pickles.\" \n \n \"You\u0027d deceive him?\" exclaimed Sadie, scandalized. \"Tell a lie to your own husband yet!\" \n \n \"Is a lie ever justifiable?\" asked Margaret ponderously. \"History and psychology answer, Yes; to the insane, the nervously distorted, and to spoiled and pampered men creatures.\" \n \n \"Well, you\u0027d have a hard time fooling our Danny! He ain\u0027t so easy fooled. A good thing he\u0027s got us to look after him if you wouldn\u0027t even put up sour for him!\" \n \n \"Now I begin to see,\" said Margaret, \"that the man, Heinz, creator of \u0027sour,\u0027 is a human benefactor and should have a noble monument erected to him by put-upon wives. I\u0027ll start the movement.\" \n \n \"A stroke of luck,\" Daniel here broke into the dispute, \"came to me to-day. You remember, Margaret, the leather store on the corner of Third and Prince streets?\" \n \n \"Yes.\" \n \n \"Danny owns near that whole block,\" Jennie quickly informed her, though Margaret\u0027s persistent indifference to such facts was a constant irritation to her and Sadie. \n \n \"I\u0027ve been getting one hundred dollars a month rent for that store,\" Daniel stated, while his sisters listened breathlessly to such fascinating statistics. \"Three months ago, George Trout, the renter, came to me and said he\u0027d have to have more storeroom for his growing business and wanted me to extend the room back into the lot. He laid it off to me how I ought to do this for him because he had rented that room from me for the past fifteen years and had never been a day late with his rent, not even when I had suddenly and unexpectedly raised his rent two years ago from seventy-five to one hundred dollars a month; and he argued that he himself had paid for the repairs and the upkeep of his storeroom for the past eight years; that his successful leather shop had increased the value of my property; and that I certainly owed it to him to extend the floor space. Well, I simply told him that if the place was too small for him, he was perfectly welcome to move; that I certainly wouldn\u0027t incur the expense of enlarging the store when I could so easily rent it any time as it was. He argued and fussed \u0027round my office and said he\u0027d been my faithful tenant for fifteen years and I had never done a thing for him and that I knew perfectly well he couldn\u0027t move his business, for there wasn\u0027t another vacant storeroom in the town in a location that wouldn\u0027t kill his business dead. Yes, I said I knew that all right. \u0027And,\u0027 said he, \u0027I absolutely require more floor space.\u0027 \u0027Yes, I know that, too,\u0027 I said, \u0027but it\u0027s no concern of mine; I have no stock in your business, Mr. Trout. I\u0027m your landlord, and you know business is always strictly business with me. I can rent that storeroom the very hour you move out of it.\u0027 He tried to tell me again about his keeping up the repairs, but I cut that short and said he\u0027d got my answer and now I was busy. Well, I certainly was amused to see how mad he looked as he flung himself out of my office. But,\" said Daniel, his eyes narrowing to the look of cunning from which Margaret was learning to wince as from a touch on a bared nerve, \"the affair has turned out just as I foresaw it would! That\u0027s the secret of my success, Margaret, as Jennie and Sadie can tell you. I look at every proposition, no matter how small a one, to find in it the main chance—the chance for me. I saw there\u0027d be only one thing for Trout to do: enlarge the store at his own expense. No more than right that he should. No least reason why I should do it.\" \n \n \"Of course not!\" exclaimed Jennie and Sadie in one breath, while Margaret, looking rather wan, did not raise her eyes from her plate, for the self-complacency of her husband\u0027s countenance, as he told his yarn, was more than she could stand. \n \n \"So, last week,\" Daniel went on, \"when the changes in the storeroom were completed, I went in and took a look around. Trout spent about eight hundred dollars on the job. Of course this enlargement increases the value of the property and demands higher rent. So, yesterday,\" Daniel smiled, \"I notified him that his rent was raised twenty-five dollars a month. He came storming into my office and said the bills for the repairs should be sent to me. I pointed out to him that I couldn\u0027t be held legally responsible for them, as I had not had them made; and that he could take his choice: pay the increased rent or get out. Well, you see, there was nothing else for him to do but pay the higher rent. Anything else spelt ruin for him. He knew that as well as I did. He had to swallow the pill,\" grinned Daniel, \"though it did go down hard! Yes, that\u0027s the way I turn things, even little things, right around to my profit, Margaret. Pretty cute, isn\u0027t it?\" \n \n \"If I were Mr. Trout,\" Margaret returned, looking white, \"I\u0027d set fire to your damned store and burn it to the ground!\" \n \n There was an instant\u0027s silent, awful consternation, when Margaret suddenly laid down her napkin and rushed from the room, every nerve in her sick and quivering with the physical and moral disgust she felt. \n \n Margaret suddenly laid down her napkin and rushed from the room, every nerve in her sick and quivering with the physical and moral disgust she felt \n Margaret suddenly laid down her napkin and rushed from the room, every nerve in her sick and quivering with the physical and moral disgust she felt \n \n When before returning to his office Daniel went to their bedroom, where Margaret, weak and despairing, lay prone upon the bed, he found the door locked against him. \n \n \"I insist upon coming in, Margaret!\" \n \n \"Go away!\" she faintly called. \n \n \"Open the door!\" he commanded. \n \n \"I won\u0027t! I can\u0027t! I don\u0027t dare to! I\u0027m dangerous! Go away from me!\" \n \n \"Get up and open this door!\" \n \n \"If I did, I\u0027d—I\u0027d scratch you! Keep away from me!\" \n \n Daniel telephoned for the doctor. \n \n \"My gracious!\" exclaimed Jennie, as they all awaited the coming of the physician in the sitting-room, \"Hiram\u0027s Lizzie never carried on like this when she was expecting!\" \n \n \"No, she certainly didn\u0027t,\" echoed Sadie; \"for all she might have had a little more right to; while Margaret, here, coming to Danny without nothing at all, up and sasses him like what she did at dinner yet! Don\u0027t it wonder you?\" \n \n Daniel, lounging in his own big chair before the fire, pouted like a thwarted, spoiled child. \n \n \"What got into her, anyhow, to act so hystericky all of a sudden?\" Sadie speculated. \n \n \"Saying she\u0027d set fire to Danny\u0027s store!\" exclaimed Jennie indignantly. \"And swearing yet! My gracious!\" \n \n \"It certainly does, now, beat all!\" said Sadie mournfully. \n \n \"I certainly didn\u0027t think she\u0027d turn out like this!\" scolded Jennie. \"You hadn\u0027t ought to have picked out a wife, Danny, without me looking her over for you first.\" \n \n \"I can\u0027t do anything with her!\" snapped Daniel spitefully. \"Nothing I can say will make her stop running with Catherine Hamilton. She tells me to my face she won\u0027t give her up. And she won\u0027t, either!\" \n \n \"Och, Danny, I wouldn\u0027t take it off of her!\" said Jennie harshly. \n \n \"Well, what can a man do?\" he fretfully demanded. \n \n \"Discharge Miss Hamilton.\" \n \n \"She\u0027s invaluable to me. She\u0027s in my confidence in a business way. I can\u0027t discharge her. It wouldn\u0027t matter to her anyway. Every lawyer in town that has any practice would like to employ her. What I\u0027m afraid of is that she\u0027ll resign. Oh, if she were afraid of losing her job, then I could easily fix Margaret!\" \n \n \"It looks, Danny, as if Margaret took up with your clerk just to spite and worry you; for what else would she run with her for?\" \n \n \"Well, if you\u0027d hear them talking together once!\" Daniel sullenly responded. \n \n \"Well, if we did?\" questioned Jennie curiously. \n \n \"You wouldn\u0027t understand a word they were saying!\" snapped her brother. \n \n \"Do they talk so dumb?\" asked Sadie wonderingly. \n \n \"They seem to think it means something—the stuff they get off to each other!\" \n \n \"It certainly does spite me, Danny,\" said Jennie with sympathetic indignation, \"to have your wife use you like this! And when I think how you could have married most anybody!\" \n \n \"Here comes the doctor,\" announced Sadie. \"Supposing she won\u0027t leave him in her room?\" \n \n \"Och, but that would make talk!\" exclaimed Jennie. \"I\u0027ll go up and tell her she has to open!\" \n \n Margaret, meantime, her sudden gust of passion subsided, realized how foolishly she was acting. \n \n \"I can\u0027t say I didn\u0027t marry him with my eyes open,\" she prodded herself. \"I have no right to scorn him and fly out at him. I see that well enough, alas! I owe him everything I can reasonably give him to make up for my lack of love.\" \n \n Her sense of her obligation to Daniel did not, however, and never could, include the denial of such fundamental principles as her friendship with Catherine Hamilton, or her own personal freedom in so far as it did not clash with his just rights. \n \n Margaret was not so stupid as to suppose for a moment that she could, by any utmost effort on her part, lead Daniel to see a case like that of George Trout\u0027s store rent as she saw it. That he could flaunt and boast of such \"deals\" proved him too hopelessly obsessed. \n \n \"If he were ashamed of it and tried to hide it, there might be some hope of redeeming him. As it is, I certainly shan\u0027t waste myself in any such futile endeavour. But if I outlive Daniel, I shall pay to George Trout or his heirs that eight hundred dollars on the very day that I get possession of my widow\u0027s third. Or, if I have a son, he shall discharge that debt!\" \n \n However, by the time Jennie knocked on her door demanding admission for the doctor, she was in a sufficiently chastened frame of mind to receive both him and her husband with all the outward semblance of a dutifully happy wife. \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1853/53677.html","bookId":968,"book":{"id":968,"title":"Her Husband\u0027s Purse","description":"简介： The Pennsylvania town of New Munich was electrified by the sudden and entirely unlooked-for announcement of the betrothal of Daniel Leitzel, Esquire; but his two maiden sisters with whom he lived, and to whom the news was also wholly unexpected, were...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1853","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:04 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:04 AM"}}
