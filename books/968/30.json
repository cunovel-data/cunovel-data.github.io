{"id":42799,"no":30,"title":"Chapter 30","content":"When a year after she had moved into town old Mrs. Leitzel died, it was Margaret\u0027s private conviction that the Leitzels had worried her to death trying to find out how she had made her will. It is said that people of mild temper are usually obstinate, and the fact stands that no one of them ever succeeded in getting from the old woman the least hint as to the disposition she had made of her large property. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"She would tell you,\" Daniel used to urge Margaret to find out the coveted secret. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But I don\u0027t care to know.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I do. Find out for me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not for any consideration on earth or in heaven, my dear, would I lift my finger about a matter which is so absolutely Mrs. Leitzel\u0027s own private and personal concern and no one else\u0027s.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The suspense and impatience with which, after her death, they awaited the reading of the will, seemed to let loose every primitive animal instinct of covetousness, and scarcely could they restrain, within decent bounds, their fierce suspicions of each other and their hawklike greed for the prey at stake. \\n\\n \\n\\n When it was found that after a bequest to the New Mennonite denomination, and one to the nurse, Miss Wenreich, the entire remainder of the fortune of the deceased was left unconditionally to Margaret, the sensations and sentiments of the Leitzels were dynamic. Even Daniel was more chagrined than pleased. An economically independent wife, he had already found, was not the sort of whom Petruchio (who expressed Daniel\u0027s idea exactly) could have said: \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I will be master of what is mine own: \\n\\n She is my goods, my chattels; she is my house, \\n\\n My household stuff, my field, my barn, \\n\\n My horse, my ox, my ass, my anything; \\n\\n And here she stands, touch her whoever dares.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n One couldn\u0027t maintain the Petruchio attitude, which was certainly the true and orderly one, toward a wife who had a large income of her own and was strangely lacking in a proper respect for her husband. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was not until Daniel discovered that Margaret had scruples about accepting the money that he found himself as fearful lest it should pass out of his family into the hands of strangers as he had hitherto been eager to get it into his own hands. The pious and solemn arguments he employed to convince her of her duty in the matter, far from having any weight with her, rather confirmed her in her feeling that, having forced the Leitzels to give up a third of their possessions to their step-mother, it put her too much in the light of a self-interested plotter to have the money come round eventually to her. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was, however, Catherine Hamilton who convinced her that she could justly keep it. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was a trial to Catherine to be obliged, when speaking of the Leitzels to Margaret, always to curb her tongue to a hypocritical form of respect for them; for Margaret would not countenance any reflections upon them. So Catherine\u0027s remarks, in the present instance, though clearly conveying her meaning, were veiled. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Do you think, Margaret, that the Leitzels, for their own spiritual discipline, ought to lose or get that money? Was old Mrs. Leitzel wise or wrong in willing it away from them? Will you be wronging or helping their immortal souls—if they have any,\" Catherine ventured rather fearfully to add, \"if you give it back to them? Another thing: you have already learned enough about married life to know that only in economic independence can a woman have any moral or spiritual freedom; can she be a personality in herself, distinct from her husband\u0027s. With all this money of your own, you will be free to control the education of your children as you could not if your husband\u0027s money had to pay for their education. Of course, in most cases, I suppose mothers and fathers have no difficulty in agreeing perfectly about their children\u0027s education; but when they differ radically, what a boon to a conscientious mother to have means at her command to do for her children what she thinks essential for their welfare in life! My dear, it\u0027s the solution of the whole confounded \u0027woman movement\u0027 that women shall be freed from an economic slavery which balks their efficiency as mothers, as citizens, and even as wives. Also, with all this money of your own, think what you can do to help me capitalize and organize my ideal school for girls! Why, I can begin next week!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And we will begin next week! I\u0027ve thought of another thing: I can now use the money Uncle Osmond left me to help educate Hattie\u0027s children. She and Walter are the sort that will never be affluent. They care too little about money ever to acquire any.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And you can have an automobile of your own in which you will now and then take my mother out for an airing to her great benefit!\" added Catherine. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It shall be at her disposal,\" declared Margaret. \\n\\n \\n\\n Another thing had occurred to her while Catherine had been speaking: Daniel, she knew, would never allow her a just portion of his wealth for the upkeep of their home and the rearing of their children. Every dollar of his that she spent would have to be discussed and argued about. This fortune which Mrs. Leitzel had left to her was really only her fair share in her husband\u0027s possessions, which she could use freely and quite independently of him. \\n\\n \\n\\n When once she was convinced that she was justified in keeping the money, the frenzied raging of the Leitzels affected her not at all, though Hiram\u0027s fury and agony carried him to the length of telling her to her face that she was stealing the money (his own mother\u0027s money) from his children to give it to her own son and daughter. \\n\\n \\n\\n As for Daniel, his chagrin over his step-mother\u0027s will swung round, in the end, to a chuckling glee over his wife\u0027s cleverness. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"After all, Margaret, you do have some business ability! I declare you outwitted us all with the cute way you managed to get things into your own hands! That wasn\u0027t a bad deal, my dear, not at all a bad deal, and I shouldn\u0027t have supposed it was in you! You seemed to care so little for money! And to think that all the while you were working such a clever scheme as this! Well, I knew when I decided to marry you that you weren\u0027t stupid. I trust that Daniel Junior will inherit the joint business acumen of his mother and father. He\u0027ll be some business man if he does, won\u0027t he?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"God forbid!\" was Margaret\u0027s reply, which Daniel thought quite idiotically irrelevant. But he was ceasing to try to understand what seemed to him his wife\u0027s unexplainable inconsistencies. \\n\\n \\n\\n He even came, in time, to submit, without fretting, to Margaret\u0027s ideas of running a household; finding her innovations, which had at first seemed to him madly extravagant, to be as necessary to his comfort and convenience as to hers. But he never did get so used to them as to cease to feel an immense pride in what Jennie and Sadie called \"Margaret\u0027s tony ways.\" He always covertly watched the faces of guests in his home (for they had guests now) to note wonder and admiration at the elegance of its appointments, the formal service at meals, the dainty tea table brought into the parlour every day at five, and the many other fastidious trifles introduced into their daily life. \\n\\n \\n\\n It is to be noted that though the intimacy of Catherine and Margaret continued throughout their lives, Catherine never once found courage to put to her friend and confidante the question to which she could not, in her knowledge of Margaret\u0027s character, find any answer: \"What in the world was it that ever induced you to marry Daniel Leitzel?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n It was only through motherhood, which was to Margaret her religion, that she learned, among other great lessons, how mistaken she had been in selling herself for a home. And the paramount ideal which she always held up to her boy and girl, as being the foundation of everything that was worth while in life, was the highest conception of mated love which she could possibly give them. \\n\\n \\n\\n The End \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1853/53689.html","bookId":968,"book":{"id":968,"title":"Her Husband\u0027s Purse","description":"简介： The Pennsylvania town of New Munich was electrified by the sudden and entirely unlooked-for announcement of the betrothal of Daniel Leitzel, Esquire; but his two maiden sisters with whom he lived, and to whom the news was also wholly unexpected, were...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1853","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:04 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:04 AM"}}
