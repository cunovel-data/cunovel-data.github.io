{"id":42771,"no":2,"title":"Chapter 2","content":"The betrothal and impending marriage of Daniel Leitzel was the only topic of discussion that evening at the New Munich Country Club dance. Certainly New Munich had a Country Club. \"Up to date in every particular.\" There was nothing in the way of being smartly fashionable that the town of New Munich lacked. Well, if up to the present it had lacked old families of \"distinguished lineage,\" who, in these commercial days, regarded that kind of thing? Anyway, was not that lack (if lack it had been) now to be supplied by the newcomer, Mrs. Daniel Leitzel? \\n\\n \\n\\n Not only at the Country Club dance, but wherever two or three were gathered together—at the mid-week Prayer Meeting, at the Woman\u0027s Suffrage Headquarters, at the Ladies\u0027 Literary Club, at the Episcopal Church Vespers, at the auction bridge given at Congressman Ocksreider\u0027s home—Danny Leitzel\u0027s betrothal was talked about. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Just imagine this \u0027daughter of a thousand earls——\u0027\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Governors, not earls,\" corrected Mr. Schaeffer, the whist partner of the first speaker who was Miss Myrtle Deibert, as supper was being served at eleven o\u0027clock on the card tables at Congressman Ocksreider\u0027s. \"A thousand governors and highbrows—shy-lologists, or something like that—whatever they are!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, just imagine such a person living at the Leitzels!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But you don\u0027t suppose Danny\u0027s sisters will still live with him after he\u0027s married!\" exclaimed Mr. Bleichert, the second young man at the table. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If he thinks it more economical, they certainly will,\" declared Miss Myrtle Deibert. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Whew!\" exclaimed Mr. Bleichert. \"Good-night!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Who would have supposed any nice girl would have married old Danny Leitzel!\" marvelled Mr. Schaeffer. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, come now,\" protested Mr. Bleichert who was a cynic, \"why have all the girls, from the buds just out, up to the bargain-counter maidens in their fourth \u0027season,\u0027 been inviting Danny Leitzel to everything going, and running after him heels over head, ever since he built his ugly, expensive brick house on Main Street? Tell me that, will you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n It should be stated here that it was an accepted social custom in New Munich for the people at one card table to discuss the clothes, manners, and morals of those at the next table. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You know perfectly well,\" retorted Miss Deibert, \"that at least two girls in this town, when it came to the point of marrying Danny, chucked it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I should think they might,\" said Schaeffer. \"Why, he isn\u0027t a man, he\u0027s a weasel, a rat, a money-slot!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, of course, the girl or old maid, \u0027bird or devil,\u0027 that has caught him at last, isn\u0027t marrying him for himself, but for his money,\" serenely affirmed Myrtle Deibert. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"When she meets his two appendages, Miss Jennie and Miss Sadie, she\u0027ll wish she was single again!\" predicted Mr. Bleichert. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They\u0027ll probably think it their business to manage Danny\u0027s wife the way they manage him,\" Miss Deibert declared. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I hope she\u0027s a spendthrift,\" shrugged Mr. Schaeffer. \"It would give Dan Leitzel the shock he needs to find himself married to a spendthrift.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"She won\u0027t be one after she\u0027s Mrs. Daniel Leitzel!\" Miss Deibert confidently asserted. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But of course she\u0027s rich—Dan Leitzel wouldn\u0027t marry a dowerless woman,\" said Bleichert. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, then he won\u0027t let her spend her money,\" Miss Deibert settled that. \\n\\n \\n\\n The second young lady at this card table, a pale, serious-looking girl, did not join in the discussion, but sat with her eyes downcast, toying with her food, as the rest chattered. The other three did not give Miss Aucker credit for remaining silent because she found their gossip vulgar and tiresome (which was indeed her true reason) but attributed her disinclination to talk to the fact that during the past year Daniel Leitzel had been rather noticeably attentive to her; so much so that people had begun to look for a possible interesting outcome. Miss Deibert, Mr. Schaeffer, and Mr. Bleichert, therefore, all considered her demeanour just now to be an indelicately open expression of her chagrin at the news they discussed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He was her last chance,\" Miss Deibert was thinking. \"She must be nearly thirty.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"One would think she wouldn\u0027t show her disappointment so frankly,\" Mr. Schaeffer was mentally criticising her. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You know,\" chuckled Miss Deibert as she dabbed with her fork at a chicken croquet, \"Danny, away from his sisters and his awful house and among strangers, would appear so like a perfect gentleman, even if he is \u0027a rat, a weasel, a money-slot,\u0027 that I think even the descendant of earls or governors might be deceived. You see he\u0027s had so many advantages; he was only ten years old when they discovered coal on their land and got rich over night. And from the first, his sisters gave him every advantage they could buy for him, sending him to the best private schools, and then to college, and then to the Harvard Law School; and every one knows that Danny Leitzel is no fool, but a brilliant lawyer. So I do think that, detached from his setting here, there\u0027s nothing about Danny that would lead an unsuspecting South Carolina bride to imagine such contingencies as Jennie and Sadie and that Main Street house. I suppose she lives in an ancestral colonial place full of antique mahogany, the kind we all buy at junk shops when we have money enough.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What kind of a woman would it be that could stand Dan Leitzel\u0027s penuriousness?\" Mr. Schaeffer speculated. \"He makes money like rolling down hill and I\u0027ve heard him jew down the old chore woman that scrubs his office and haggle over a fifty-cent bill for supper at the club. He\u0027s the worst screw I ever knew. And mind you, his bride\u0027s a Southern woman, accustomed to liberality and gallantry and everything she won\u0027t find at Danny\u0027s house!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Do you know (not many people in New Munich do seem to know) that the Leitzels\u0027 mother is living?\" said Miss Deibert. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I know a woman that knows her. She lives in the Leitzels\u0027 old farmhouse out in Martz Township.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But Miss Jennie and Miss Sadie are too old to have a mother living.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s their step-mother. But she brought them up from little children and I heard she even took in washing to support them when their own father drank—and now they\u0027re ashamed of her and don\u0027t have anything to do with her. I was told she\u0027s a dear old soul and never speaks against them, but is as proud of their rise in the world as if she were their own mother. The neighbours out there say she has a hard time getting on and that they don\u0027t do a thing for her except let her live in their old tumble-down farmhouse. Isn\u0027t it a shame, as rich as they are!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You can\u0027t believe everything you hear.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But it would be just like them!\" affirmed Bleichert. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mary!\" Miss Deibert suddenly laid her hand playfully on that of the silent Miss Aucker. \"Congratulations on your escape, my dear!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I was never in the least danger, Myrtle. Aren\u0027t we gossiping rather dreadfully? I\u0027ve been wondering\"—she looked up with a smile that transformed her seriousness into a gentle radiance—\"what a newcomer like Mr. Leitzel\u0027s wife, doomed to live here, will do with us and our social life, if she really is a woman of breeding and culture. I wonder whether it would be possible this winter to make our social coming together count for something more than—well, than just an utter waste of time. What is there in it all—our afternoon teas, auction bridge, luncheons, dinners, dances. The dances are of course the best thing we do because they are at least refreshing and rejuvenating. But don\u0027t you think, Myrtle, that we might make it all more worth while?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There\u0027s the Ladies\u0027 Literary Club,\" Myrtle suggested, \"for those that want something \u0027worth while,\u0027 as you put it. I think it\u0027s an awful bore myself.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Of course it is,\" Mary agreed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But what would you suggest then?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I suppose it is after all a question of what is in ourselves. A dozen literary clubs at which we read abstracts from encyclopedias wouldn\u0027t alter the fact that when we get together we have so little, so little to give to each other!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, I don\u0027t know!\" protested Myrtle. \"We all read all the latest books and magazines and talk about them, and——\" \\n\\n \\n\\n At an adjoining table another phase of the agitating news was being threshed out. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If she\u0027s what the papers say she is, I suppose she\u0027ll turn up her nose at New Munich,\" said the daughter of the Episcopal rector. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, I don\u0027t think she need put on any airs!\" said Miss Ocksreider, the hostess\u0027s daughter. \"I\u0027ve visited down South and I can tell you we\u0027re enough more up to date here in New Munich. Nearly every one down there, even their aristocrats, is so poor that up here they wouldn\u0027t be anybody. It\u0027s awfully queer the way those Southerners don\u0027t care anything about appearances. They tell you right out they can\u0027t afford this and that, and they don\u0027t seem to think anything of wearing clothes all out of style. There was an awfully handsome new house in the town where I stopped, and when I asked the hotel clerk who lived in it and if they weren\u0027t great swells, he said: \u0027Oh, no, they are not in society; they\u0027re not one of our families, though they\u0027re very nice people, of course, members of church and good to the poor and all like that.\u0027 \u0027Not in society in a little town like this Leesburg, and living in a mansion like that?\u0027 I said. Yes, that\u0027s the way they are down there.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How queer!\" came from two of her table companions to whom, like herself, any but money standards of value were rather vague and hazy. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But if they don\u0027t care for money down there, then what\u0027s this girl marrying Dan Leitzel for?\" one of the men candidly wondered. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, you know there\u0027s no accounting for tastes.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I could excuse any woman\u0027s marrying for money—in these days it\u0027s only prudent,\" said the candid one; \"but I certainly couldn\u0027t respect a woman that married Dan Leitzel for anything else.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s to be hoped she\u0027s an up-to-date girl and not a clinging vine, for Danny will need very firm handling to make him part with enough money to keep her in gloves and slippers and other necessary luxuries,\" said Miss Ocksreider. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, if it were only her husband that she\u0027ll have to manage; but there are Miss Jennie and Miss Sadie, too!\" cried the rector\u0027s daughter. \"Danny doesn\u0027t so much as put on a necktie without consulting them. They even tie it for him and part his hair for him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That may be,\" said one of the men, \"but let me tell you that any one who thinks Dan Leitzel hasn\u0027t any force of character better take another guess. If he lets his sisters choose his neckties for him, it\u0027s because he doesn\u0027t want to do it himself. He\u0027s the most consummately selfish individual I\u0027ve ever known in the whole course of my long and useful life and the most immovably obstinate. Weak? Why, when that fellow takes a notion, he\u0027s a mule for sticking to it. Reason with him? Go out in your chicken yard and reason with your hens. It wouldn\u0027t be as futile!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He may be independent of his sisters, but his wife won\u0027t be!\" prophesied the rector\u0027s daughter darkly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Anyway,\" said Miss Ocksreider, \"it will be interesting, won\u0027t it, to look on this winter at the drama or comedy or tragedy, as the case may be, of Danny Leitzel\u0027s marriage?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Won\u0027t it!\" exclaimed in chorus her hearers. \\n\\n \\n\\n But at one of the other tables a man was at this moment remarking: \"You may all laugh at Dan Leitzel—he\u0027s funny of course—but he\u0027s all the same a man of brains and education, of wealth and influence and power. In short, he\u0027s a successful man. And in Pennsylvania who asks anything more of a man?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1853/53661.html","bookId":968,"book":{"id":968,"title":"Her Husband\u0027s Purse","description":"简介： The Pennsylvania town of New Munich was electrified by the sudden and entirely unlooked-for announcement of the betrothal of Daniel Leitzel, Esquire; but his two maiden sisters with whom he lived, and to whom the news was also wholly unexpected, were...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1853","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:04 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:04 AM"}}
