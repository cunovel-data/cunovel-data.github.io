{"id":42790,"no":21,"title":"Chapter 21","content":"Margaret felt an impersonal curiosity as to what Daniel would say to her when he came home to his dinner at noon. Jennie and Sadie were also curious as to that. But Daniel himself was curious, too. How was a husband to meet such unnatural behaviour in a wife? Did other men\u0027s wives so disregard their husbands\u0027 wishes and commands? If women got much more independent it would break up the holy estate of matrimony altogether. \n \n He finally decided, on his homeward walk, that about the only course open to him was to take refuge in a dignified silence, though now that Margaret\u0027s time was drawing near, he felt sufficiently apprehensive of the outcome to be very leniently inclined toward her. Funny how he cared for her when she treated him the way she did! He could not help it, somehow. She certainly had a way with her! Well, when she was over her trial and quite herself again, he\u0027d have another try at bringing her to a proper sense of the confederation to which he was accustomed and which was his due. \n \n He wondered uneasily what the people of the town thought of this incongruous intimacy between his clerk and his wife. It certainly passed his comprehension as much as it did that of his sisters that a girl as \"high-toned\" as Margaret was should insist upon being intimate with his stenographer. That Miss Hamilton was equally \"high-toned,\" he was incapable of recognizing. Jennie had voiced his own sentiments when a few days before she had exclaimed, \"When she could run with anybody, she goes and picks out an office clerk! It\u0027s nothing else, Danny, but that she\u0027s bound to act contrary, to show us she don\u0027t care if she didn\u0027t bring you a dollar to her name!\" \n \n However, a letter which he found on the hall table when he reached home diverted not only his own attention, but that of the whole household, from Margaret\u0027s case. \n \n It was from the school teacher of Martz Township, who wrote in behalf of his step-mother; and after dinner, as the family sat together, as was their custom, in the sitting-room, for an hour before Daniel went again to his office—Jennie and Sadie fussing about him to make him comfortable, adjusting the window-blind, placing his chair, handing him the newspaper, retying his necktie, brushing his coat collar—Daniel presently opened and read the letter he had received. \n \n Margaret listened to it and to the lengthy discussion which followed with an attention that was to bear early and abundant fruit. \n \n \n \"DEAR FRIEND: \n \n \"I am writing for Mrs. Leitzel, to leave you know she had it so bad in her lungs here the past couple weeks the neighbours thought it would give pneumonia, but she got better and now she\u0027s up again, but very weak, and I\u0027m leaving you know that we think she ought not to live alone a half a mile away from her nearest neighbour, because if she got so sick that she couldn\u0027t help herself, she might die before her neighbours found it out yet that she needed help. And she\u0027s too feeble any more to make up her fires and fetch her water from the spring and chop her wood. The house not having any modern improvements, and so much out of repair, it makes it harder, too, for such an old woman. And she has hardly anything to live on. The neighbours say she had either ought to have some one with her, or you ought to take her to your home to live. If not, she\u0027ll have to go the poorhouse, and that of course you would not want, either. \n \n \"She is better now and says to tell you not to worry, but I warn you she may get down sick again any time, as old as what she is. And I think you have got good cause to worry, though I told her I\u0027d tell you not to. If it hadn\u0027t been for the neighbours doing for her this last couple weeks, she\u0027d have died. \n \n \"Yours truly, \n \"MAYBELLE RAUCH. \n \n \"P.S. She says she sends her love to all and that you have got no need to worry.\" \n \n \n But Daniel and his sisters did seem to think they had \"need to worry\" very much, at the startling revelations of this letter, not the revelations as to their step-mother\u0027s sufferings and needs, but as to the neighbourhood publicity given to their neglect of her. \n \n \"To think she\u0027d go and have that busybody teacher and all her other neighbours in and complain to \u0027em all like this, so\u0027s they write to us yet and ask for help for her! Well, this beats all! She never went this far before!\" scolded Jennie. \n \n \"Yes, I don\u0027t see why she couldn\u0027t leave us know herself if she\u0027s got any complaints, and not put it out to the whole township like this!\" Sadie worried. \n \n \"It certainly will make talk out there!\" Daniel frowned. \n \n \"Enough to get into the newspapers if she doesn\u0027t watch out!\" \n \n \"But how,\" Margaret ventured a question, \"could she let you know except in the way she\u0027s taking, since she can\u0027t write herself? And how could she help having the neighbours in if she was ill and helpless and alone?\" \n \n \"She could anyhow have sent us a postal card to say she was sick and wanted one of us to come out,\" said Jennie. \n \n \"Would you have gone to her?\" \n \n \"Of course one of us would have gone.\" \n \n \"Maybe she couldn\u0027t even write a postal card, or get out to mail it if she did write it, if she\u0027s so old and feeble, and was ill.\" \n \n \"If that was the case,\" said Daniel, \"then to avoid a repetition of the occurrence, I don\u0027t see what else we are to do but put her into a home.\" \n \n \"You know how she\u0027s against that, Danny,\" said Jennie. \"If you decide to do it, you\u0027ll have a time with her! And those neighbours all taking her part!\" \n \n \"This impertinent teacher,\" said Daniel, tapping the letter he held, \"has the face to reproach us, you notice, for not keeping the place in repair! It wasn\u0027t our business to keep it in repair when we never get any rent for it.\" \n \n \"Yes, it does seem as if Mom might have kept it in repair when she was getting it rent free,\" said Jennie. \"I don\u0027t see why she has not been able to save something in all these years from what she\u0027s earnt from her vegetable garden.\" \n \n \"She certainly hasn\u0027t managed good,\" said Sadie. \n \n \"And to think of the cheek of those neighbours!\" said Jennie wrathfully. \"Saying we had ought to take her in here to live with us yet! As if she was our own flesh and blood!\" \n \n \"What would Hiram say to something like this coming!\" Sadie speculated; \"when he thinks we did too much in not charging her rent.\" \n \n \"Well,\" Daniel suddenly announced with a magnanimous air that seemed to swell his chest, \"I\u0027ll send her a check. I\u0027ll send her five dollars. Maybe I\u0027ll make it ten.\" \n \n \"Ten dollars yet, Danny!\" said Sadie, regarding her brother with affectionate admiration. \n \n \"I\u0027m not sure I\u0027ll send as much as ten. But anyhow five.\" \n \n \"She\u0027ll be sure to show the check around to prove to those neighbours how good you are to her.\" \n \n \"And there will be some among them,\" said Daniel indignantly, \"that will be ready enough to call it stingy!\" \n \n \"Oh, well, some folks would say it was stingy if you sent her twenty-five dollars yet!\" \n \n \"If you and Sadie want to put a little to what I send,\" Daniel tentatively suggested, \"we might make it ten or fifteen.\" \n \n \"Well,\" said Jennie reluctantly, \"it ain\u0027t fair for you to pay all, either. What do you say, Sadie?\" \n \n \"Well,\" Sadie hesitatingly agreed; \"for all, I did want to get a new fancy for my white hat. How much will you give, Jennie?\" \n \n \"Well, if you and I each give two-fifty to Danny\u0027s five or ten, that ought to stop her neighbours\u0027 talking out there.\" \n \n \"All right,\" Sadie pensively agreed. \n \n \"No use asking Hiram to contribute,\" Daniel growled, \"when he thinks we ought to charge her rent for the place. He gets angry whenever he hears I gave her a little. I told him once, \u0027If I can better afford than you can to give her a little, and I don\u0027t ask you to help out, what are you kicking about?\u0027 \u0027It\u0027s the principle of it,\u0027 he said. \u0027If you give her money, it\u0027s admitting you owe it to her, or you wouldn\u0027t give it to her. Now I contend that we don\u0027t owe her anything.\u0027 \u0027Well, then,\u0027 I said, \u0027when I give her a little now and then, I\u0027ll put it down on my accounts under Christian Charities. Will that satisfy you?\u0027 But no, even that didn\u0027t satisfy him. He\u0027s all for putting her to a home. And it looks now as if that\u0027s what we\u0027ll have to do pretty soon,\" Daniel concluded, rising to go to his office. \n \n Margaret looked on in silence as Jennie and Sadie each counted out carefully from their purses two dollars and a half and passed it over to their brother. \n \n \"I\u0027ll send a check, then, to mother for fifteen dollars,\" he said as he put the money into his own purse. \"I\u0027ll make it fifteen,\" he nodded. \"I\u0027m willing to make it fifteen. That will certainly settle the gossips out there and keep her going for a while comfortably.\" \n \n He came across the room to Margaret\u0027s chair by the window. \n \n \"Good-bye, my dear,\" he said, bending to kiss her; and it took all her self-control not to shrink in utter repugnance from his caress. \n \n \"Oh!\" she inwardly moaned as she turned to gaze out of the window when he had gone, \"what crime have I committed in marrying a man I——\" \n \n But even her innermost secret thought recoiled from the admission that she despised her husband, the father of her child. \n \n She went upstairs to her room to spend the time, while she waited for the hour of Catherine\u0027s arrival, in putting some last touches to the baby outfit she had made and in writing a note to Daniel\u0027s step-mother expressing her sympathy with her recent illness and reiterating her promise to come to see her as soon as possible after her confinement. \n \n \"I\u0027ll mail it myself,\" she decided as she sealed and stamped her letter, \"or give it to Catherine to mail.\" \n \n At four o\u0027clock, feeling a little nervous, but quite determined, she went downstairs to await the signal ring at the door. As it was ten days since Catherine had been to the house, Margaret hoped that Emmy, the maid, was off her guard, unless the episode of this morning had caused Jennie and Sadie to renew their watchfulness. \n \n \"It\u0027s so stupid of them, to say the least, to imagine I\u0027d submit to such interference in my own personal affairs!\" she reflected. \n \n She knew their suspicions would be aroused if they found her in the parlour, for of late she spent most of her time in her own room. But she felt quite ready to deal with them as effectively as she had done that morning. \n \n She had not been downstairs long when a ring at the door-bell brought her to her feet, only to sink down again trembling, for it was not the four by twos agreed upon between her and Catherine; and a moment later Mrs. Ocksreider was shown into the parlour. Jennie and Sadie came directly into the room to receive with much satisfaction this distinguished and now frequent visitor who, until Daniel\u0027s marriage, had confined her calls on them to once a year; and they looked surprised to see Margaret already there. \n \n \"Were you expecting Mrs. Congressman Ocksreider that you\u0027re down already?\" Jennie suspiciously inquired, when the sisters had greeted Mrs. Ocksreider obsequiously. \n \n \"No, but I\u0027m expecting Miss Hamilton,\" Margaret quietly announced. \"I have an appointment with her at four-thirty. When she comes, I shall have to ask you all to excuse me.\" \n \n Jennie and Sadie looked the consternation they felt at Margaret\u0027s audacity, not to say disrespect, in asking such a person as Mrs. Ocksreider to excuse her because of an appointment with that Hamilton girl! \n \n \"It\u0027s to be hoped,\" Jennie rapidly thought, \"that Mrs. Ocksreider will think it\u0027s a business appointment she\u0027s got with our Danny\u0027s clerk,\" while Sadie ostentatiously consulted her new wrist-watch to see how soon they might expect the objectionable Miss Hamilton. \n \n \"You and your husband\u0027s stenographer seem to be great friends,\" said Mrs. Ocksreider with what seemed to Margaret a rather malicious enjoyment of her sisters-in-law\u0027s evident discomfiture. \n \n \"We are,\" said Margaret. \n \n \"I\u0027ve always heard those Hamiltons very well spoken of, as very nice, worthy people,\" Mrs. Ocksreider said in a tone of kindly condescension. \"Where do they live, Mrs. Leitzel?\" \n \n That Mrs. Ocksreider shouldn\u0027t even know where they lived, put them of course outside the pale. Jennie and Sadie suffered acutely at Margaret\u0027s reply. \n \n \"They live in a small rented house on Green Street,\" she said, and added: \"One of the few really distinguished homes in our town.\" \n \n \"\u0027Distinguished?\u0027\" repeated Mrs. Ocksreider, puzzled. \n \n \"I mean, rather, it is a home that has distinction, by reason of its inmates and its furnishings.\" \n \n \"Its furnishings?\" questioned Mrs. Ocksreider, still puzzled. \n \n \"Its pictures and books and general good taste. One of the few households that have pictures and books.\" \n \n \"Oh, but we all have pictures and books, Mrs. Leitzel!\" \n \n \"Real pictures, I mean, and real books, too.\" \n \n \"But I\u0027m sure most families of our class have the classics in their homes,\" Mrs. Ocksreider protested. \n \n \"The classics\u0027 do help to furnish a room nicely, don\u0027t they?\" Margaret granted. \"But the Hamiltons have books which they read. French and German as well as English.\" \n \n \"Well, of course, a public school teacher\u0027s home would be likely to have all kinds of books,\" Mrs. Ocksreider conceded, \"that society people wouldn\u0027t buy.\" \n \n \"Of course,\" Margaret agreed. \n \n \"But I don\u0027t see why that should make their little home on Green Street what you called it—\u0027distinguished.\u0027\" \n \n \"But I said the furnishings and the inmates gave it distinction. You see, I know because I am very intimate with them.\" \n \n \"I have heard that you were. It is so nice for your husband\u0027s little stenographer that you should take her up like that. It\u0027s so unusual, too. She\u0027s very fortunate, I\u0027m sure.\" \n \n \"It\u0027s rather she that has taken me up. I\u0027m quite proud that she thinks me worth the time she gives me. You see she\u0027s more than Mr. Leitzel\u0027s stenographer: she\u0027s an able law clerk. Mr. Leitzel says she\u0027s indispensable to him.\" \n \n \"Then he and his sisters share your enthusiasm over the Hamiltons?\" Mrs. Ocksreider inquired in a tone of polite skepticism. \n \n \"I am the only one of us all who is intimate with them,\" Margaret complacently stated. \n \n \"I didn\u0027t see them at your reception last fall, did I?\" \n \n \"They didn\u0027t come,\" Margaret readily answered. \"You know they don\u0027t go into society at all.\" \n \n Jennie and Sadie felt cold as they heard these shameless admissions, their Danny\u0027s wife bragging of her intimacy with people whom she openly advertised as living in a rented house on a side street and as not going into society! Not to go into society was, in the Leitzels\u0027 eyes, to be so abjectly unimportant as to make you want to get off the earth. And Margaret flaunted it! \n \n \"Ain\u0027t she the contrary piece though!\" Jennie inwardly raged. \n \n \"Ah!\" Margaret almost jumped from her chair as the door-bell at this moment rang \"four by twos.\" \n \n \"That\u0027s Miss Hamilton now,\" she announced, rising and walking as quickly as she could (which was not very quick) across the room. \"Will you please excuse me, Mrs. Ocksreider? I am sorry, but it is an appointment——\" \n \n But as she reached the door which opened into the hall, she saw the front door closed abruptly by Emmy, the maid. \n \n Instantly stepping back into the parlour, Margaret hurried to the window, rapped upon it, then raised it and leaned out to speak to Miss Hamilton on the pavement. \"Emmy made a mistake; I am at home, Catherine. Come back, and I\u0027ll open the door.\" \n \n She closed the window and again made her way heavily across the room, smiling in a friendly way upon Mrs. Ocksreider as she passed her. \"A mistake of the maid\u0027s. I\u0027m seeing so few people just now,\" she dropped an explanation on her way. \n \n Mrs. Ocksreider\u0027s subsequent description of the scene, in which the Leitzel sisters\u0027 horror at Mrs. Leitzel\u0027s innocent candour about \"those Hamiltons,\" and the young woman\u0027s clever outwitting of her two would-be \"keepers,\" afforded most delectable entertainment to New Munich society for two months to come. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1853/53680.html","bookId":968,"book":{"id":968,"title":"Her Husband\u0027s Purse","description":"简介： The Pennsylvania town of New Munich was electrified by the sudden and entirely unlooked-for announcement of the betrothal of Daniel Leitzel, Esquire; but his two maiden sisters with whom he lived, and to whom the news was also wholly unexpected, were...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1853","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:04 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:04 AM"}}
