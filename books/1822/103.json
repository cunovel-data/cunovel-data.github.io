This performance was going to be pivotal for my further plans. On it would hinge everything I would try to do to further Ella’s hopes and dreams and smash Sir Philip into smithereens!\\n\\n The two of them stood on either side of the fence for a long while, simply staring at each other with desperate longing, trying to bridge the distance between them with their gazes. Or at least I figured that’s what they were doing. With the moon having disappeared behind clouds, it was pretty dark in the garden, so I couldn’t actually be sure about the staring-at-each-other-with-desperate-longing part. They might just have fallen asleep standing.\\n\\n ‘Ella, my love,’ Edmund said in a raw voice.\\n\\n Ah. Not asleep. So I had been right. And if that wasn’t desperate longing in his voice, I didn’t know what desperate longing was.\\n\\n ‘Edmund, my love,’ my little sister whispered. Apparently, she was very much awake as well.\\n\\n ‘How do things stand?’ he demanded.\\n\\n When Ella said nothing in response, he pushed on: ‘What is the matter? Why do you not speak? Why do you not step closer to me? Speak, my love! I can no longer live without the sweet honey of your voice sustaining me!’\\n\\n I suppressed an urge to gag.\\n\\n How would you like the honey of my fist in your face, fellow?\\n\\n But his mushy-gushy mush seemed to hit the spot with Ella. She opened her mouth and took a breath, preparing to speak.\\n\\n ‘I… I danced three times with Sir Philip,’ she answered timidly. I noticed she didn’t step closer to the fence, made no move at all to approach her beloved with the messy hair.\\n\\n ‘Only three times during the entire evening? When he is supposedly courting you?’ Edmund’s face brightened. I thought dancing three times with the same person was quite a lot, but I didn’t doubt if he had the chance, he’d spent the entire evening glued to her. ‘Oh Ella, you give me hope. Tell me, has he lost interest in you, the fool? Has he withdrawn his affections?’\\n\\n My sister gave a little shake of the head.\\n\\n ‘No.’\\n\\n ‘Then why on earth would he not…’\\n\\n ‘It is my dear sister.’ Dang! She’s talking about me! ‘My dear, dear sister who protects me. It is amazing. Though she knows not a thing of how things truly stand, of where my affections truly lie, she instinctively seems to be able to sense somehow that I do not welcome his attentions. Not just tonight at the ball - whenever he comes, she is there, between him and me, helping me, protecting me. Sometimes I ask myself whether she is clairvoyant, so clearly can she read what I feel. It is as if she could hear every secret word I speak to you!’\\n\\n Um… Well, about that…\\n\\n Deeply moved, Edmund nodded. ‘I have heard of this - a strong emotional bond between siblings who cherish for one another the deepest affection can have such remarkable effects. She must be a remarkable girl. I wish I could meet her someday.’\\n\\n No problem. Just come around the bush and wave.\\n\\n Ella shook her head vigorously. ‘You cannot! Remember, she must never know of us.’\\n\\n ‘You’re right. She must never know.’\\n\\n I rolled my eyes. Really? Gosh…\\n\\n There was a pause. Then Edmund added: ‘But we have strayed away from the heart of the matter, dearest.’\\n\\n Ella’s lower lip began to quiver.\\n\\n ‘Which is?’\\n\\n ‘Sir Philip Wilkins still pursues you.’\\n\\n ‘Oh, cruel, cruel Edmund! How can you remind me?’\\n\\n Edmund reached through the poles to squeeze her hands, and she immediately ceased her lamentations.\\n\\n ‘I must remind you,’ he persisted in a gentle tone of voice. ‘I must, because we must form plans and find an escape, find some way to forge a future for ourselves.’\\n\\n Her eyes tearing up again, Ella suddenly stumbled forward and sagged against the fence.\\n\\n ‘No plans can save me,’ she whispered. ‘I have no future!’\\n\\n Now that’s just not true! I shook my head disapprovingly. If people only could be more accurate about such things. She might have a future wherein she would be absolutely miserable, married to a man she couldn’t stand and separated from her one true love - but she would definitely have a future. One should always be accurate. Ten hours a day and six days a week of sorting files for an office tyrant teaches a girl that much.\\n\\n ‘That is why I said we would forge a future, Ella. You may not have one now, but we will find a way.’\\n\\n ‘How, Edmund, my love? How can we possibly find a way?’\\n\\n ‘I do not know yet. But take heart, my love. With time, we will surely devise a plan and…’\\n\\n ‘With time?’ More tears running down her delicate face, Ella stared through the fence in desperation. Now the moon was out from behind the clouds and I could actually see the mournful expression clearly. It made me wish for darkness again. ‘With time? Edmund, you do not understand. We do not have time. I… I believe…’\\n\\n ‘What?’ Edmund stepped closer to the fence and grabbed the metal poles. ‘What are you keeping from me? Tell me! I beg you, my love, tell me!’\\n\\n ‘I believe,’ Ella said in a breathless whisper, ‘that Sir Philip will shortly propose matrimony.’\\n\\n ‘No! Say it isn’t so!’\\n\\n ‘Yes, my love.’ Reaching up, she swiftly touched his pallid cheek with her fingertips. ‘Yes, it is. I wish it were not so, but I cannot change it. I cannot change my fate.’\\n\\n There were a few moments of heavy silence. Edmund was staring at the ground, his fists clenched at his sides. Curious, I leaned forward, trying to get a look at his face, but it was impossible to see from here.\\n\\n Blast! And this is the best part of the drama!\\n\\n I should have gotten a seat closer to the stage.\\n\\n Then, suddenly, he raised his head again, and I blinked in surprise. I hardly recognized him. All the despair was gone from his face, replaced by a look of iron, immovable determination.\\n\\n ‘Yes, you can,’ he said in a hoarse voice. ‘You can change your fate, my love. Run away with me! Run away with me and become my wife!’\\n\\n You could have knocked me down with a feather. Actually, half a feather might have done it. Or maybe a very small piece of yarn?\\n\\n Ella, I could see, was equally taken aback. She wasn’t gaping open-mouthed at Edmund like I was - proper ladies don\u0027t do that sort of thing - but she had definitely turned an even whiter shade of pale than she normally was. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/storm-and-silence/page-103.html","bookId":1822,"book":{"id":1822,"title":"Storm and Silence","description":"Storyline: Freedom—that is what Lilly Linton wants most in life.
