Not marriage, not a brood of squalling brats, and certainly not love, thank you very much! But freedom is a rare commodity in 19th-century London, where girls are expected to spend their lives sitting at home, fully occupied with looking pretty. Lilly is at her wits’ end—until a chance encounter with a dark, dangerous and powerful stranger changes her life forever... Enter the world of Mr Rikkard Ambrose, where the only rule is: Knowledge is power is time is money!","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/storm-and-silence.jpg","author":"Robert Thier","type":"Historical","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":248,"category":{"id":20,"name":"Historical","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
