My branch of the family came over from Europe in probably the seventeenth century or so and eventually wound up in Louisiana. Over the centuries, shape-shifters like us have been nomads, travelers, explorers, even mistaken for gypsies. Groups of us stay together, in a pack. Like wolves, we’re comfortable only when we’re together. We adopted the wolf hierarchy because of our appearance when we shift. I’m the alpha of our little group, and we’re on our way to Georgia to meet up with my cousin Zack.We’re all distantly related, of course. Their pack is strong, and he says there’s land for us to build on, sowe can start our own branch. It’s too hard for alphas to live together, so that’s why they built their own lodges and started this kind of alliance. We’re going to settle there too and build our own home. The other packs will help us.” “What about me? Why do you need me?” “Since we intermarry within the packs so much—not close relatives, of course, but sometimes, distant cousins—over the years our entire pack has become all extended family. Members of our pack usually meet their mates when we interact with adjoining packs. Occasionally, we take a human mate.” “Why just occasionally?” “The simple answer is that humans are too much trouble, Jax. They have families who miss them and want to visit. We can’t allow that. The humans don’t always adapt to our way of life. Pack life isn’t for everybody, I guess. And then there’s the no-longer-quite-human thing.” “What do you mean?” “Once we give our mates the mating bite, they’re not quite human any more. They could live off our blood indefinitely. They live much longer lives, like up to two hundred years, as we do. They’re stronger, better-looking, faster. And they don’t age much past the age of thirty. That usually means they have to break off all their former family ties because we have to ensure the safety and anonymity of the pack. ” “But you say you want me for your mate? So you’re saying that will happen to me?” “Yes, but in our case, there’s a difference. Sometimes, with some members of the pack, and it’s really rare—a different kind of mating takes place. Nobody knows much about it. My grandparents had it, so I know a little more than most. My pack calls it soif de sang.That’s French for bloodlust.” “Why French?” Jax had become calmer during Cade’s long explanation. He sat on the bed beside Cade, almost lethargic after the huge adrenalinerush he’d experienced. “My branch of the family came from France many years ago. There’s some evidence that we could have been Acadians. They were a group, originally from France, who settled in Canada in the seventeenth century. They were moved from Canada against their will, and some were taken to Louisiana, where they became the present day Cajuns. We’re related to them. We still have very close ties in Canada and in France, and my pack speaksFrench as our second language. It’s what we learn growing up.” Jax nodded. “And this ‘soft duh song’ thing…” Cade corrected his pronunciation. “So-off-duh-sahn,” he pronounced slowly and carefully, leaving off the final g sound. “It means bloodlust, but it doesn’t mean like someone’s going to suck someone else dry like a vampire or anything. A long time ago, and the legend is fuzzy on this part, something happened. You see, we know our true mates when we see them or smell them. Our mates have a certain scent that we recognize,and it’s absolutely irresistible to us. The soif de sang is like the blood match on steroids. These mates share everything with their wolves—and I mean everything. Thoughts, feelings—blood. And their mark.” “I don’t understand.” “Look, if one of us finds his soif de sang, if he’s granted one, then he has to be with them all the time—he can’t stand to be away from them for longer than a day. He has to bite them, give them the mark and from that time on, they too have the ability to shape-shift. That part is, I admit, a little like the Hollywood thing. A regularblood match can’t do that. The compulsion to shift is not as strong, and they don’t have to shift, but they can if they want to, or if they ever need to for any reason. Like to defend themselves or their partner. The two partners share everything, even blood. They drink small amounts of blood from each other whenever they make love. They need to do this—they have to do it to survive.” “And that’s where I come in, huh? I’m your soif de sangthing? And just what’s in it for me exactly? The chance to turn into a werewolf? Drink your blood? No fucking way.” “Not only that. Again, your life would be greatly expanded. You’d live as long as your mate survives, and once you mate, the two of you will die together, after a long, long life.” Cade didn’t say if we mate,and he wondered if Jax had noticed. “I told you about that and about being stronger and faster. Even immune to human diseases. No human could ever stand up to your strength.” For the first time, Jax’s eyes lit up. “No one? I’d be like invincible?” “No human could withstand it. Other wolves would still be stronger.” Ignoring him, Jax continued. “But I would be strong? No one could force me to do something I didn’t want to do? I’d be able to defend myself if someone came after me?” Cade stirred uneasily. “Yes, incredibly strong and fast…you’ve seen how quickly we’re able to move. I’m an alpha, which is the highest-ranking wolf in a pack. That means I’m the leader of this pack. As my soif de sang, you would share that status. You’d become my alpha mate.” Jax nodded, his eyes glowing softly. “I like that. And no one would ever be able to hurt me or Mason ever again?” “That’s right.” “Then hell yeah,” Jax said, his eyes sparkling. “Let’s fucking do this.” Chapter Three Cade stared at him, his mouth slightly open in surprise. “Y -you wantto mate with me?” “Hell, yes. What do I have to do?” “First of all, slow down. Do you…like men, then? Jax raised his gazespeculatively, looking over Cade’s body. This was the first time he’d seen him even partially naked, and he very much liked what he saw. Cade had a nipple ring in one nipple that was making it hard for Jax to concentrate. He tore his eyes from it and nodded. “Yeah, I like guys—always have, which was part of the reason I’ve been picked on. Not to take anything away from you—I mean, you’re really good-looking, but it’s not so much you as what you can offer me. Growing up small and different and gay inthe Bible Belt south hasn’t been any picnic, let me tell you. Not to mention…” He shook his head and caught himself. No need to air his dirty laundry with this man. He didn’t know him well enough for that. Hell, maybe he never would. His secrets were shameful and humiliating, and he doubted if he’d ever share them with anybody. “The chance to be strong, almost invincible— and a leader—hell yeah, I want that,” Jax continued softly. “I’ve spent my life being picked on by assholes who were bigger and stronger than me. I’d like to be able to take care of myself and Mason, and never have to worry about being taken advantage of again.” “You understand what this means. You can’t undo it once it’s done, Jax. We hardly know each other, but you’ll be pledged to me for the rest of your very long life. There will never be anyone else for you. Only me.” “I get it. That would go both ways, wouldn’t it?” A small smile played around Cade’s lips. “Yes, it would go both ways.” “And Mason stays with me. He’s part of the deal.” “Of course.” Jax nodded. “Okay, then how do we do this?” He lay down on the bed and opened his legs, letting his fingers trail down his abs. “Do you want me like this?” Cade shot up suddenly and moved across the room so fast Jax could barely follow him with his eyes. Shaking his head, he stared back at Jax’s surprised face. “I-I’m sorry. I don’t want to take you like this. I don’t want to hurt you. But my wolf…he almost got away from me just then.” “Your wolf?” “It’s inside me, Jax. It’s always with me. It will be born inside you eventually after we share our blood. I’m trying to control him now, but it’s difficult. Like earlier, when those truckers were threatening you, I almost lost control then. I would have ripped them apart.” Jax’s eyes grew wide and he nodded. “But you stopped yourself…” “Yes, I was able to control it, because I had you safe, but it was a near thing. As much as those assholes deserved it…” Jax watched in fascination as his eyes grew dark and wild. His face seemed to almost blur and stretch. Long incisors dropped from his mouth and Jax recoiled in horror. Then, with a hard shake of his head, Cade was back to normal, the incisors retracted and his face was once more the same handsome face Jax was growing very used to. “Sorry,” Cade said, his voice low and guttural, unlike his normal voice. “I guess I only thought I had it under control.” “That’s what those truckers saw back there when they got so scared.” Cade nodded, his eyes solemn. “What-what’s it like? Does it hurt?” “To shift? No, not exactly. It’s more like…losing myself for a while. Today, when I stood in front of those men, I could smell their blood, their fear. It was like a hunger, a tingle in my nose, a burning in my veins. Their terror when they saw me was sweet to me too, their panic like an elixir.” He shook his head. “Hard to explain, because my wolf doesn’t think in words—just images that flash in my brain.” Jax nodded once, his hands gripping the blanket beneath him. The danger in the air around him was almost palpable. “Would you…hurt me?”","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bloodlust-dark-hollow-wolf-pack-9/page-11.html","bookId":2261,"book":{"id":2261,"title":"Bloodlust (Dark Hollow Wolf Pack #9)","description":"Storyline: Bloodlust (Dark Hollow Wolf Pack #9) Forty miles east of New Orleans, dog tired and out of money, nineteen year old Jax and his little brother are on the run.
