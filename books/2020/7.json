His contributions to meteorology, however, although considerable, pale before what has ever since been known as the Leggen Controversy. That his actions helped to place Hari Seldon in jeopardy is undisputable, but argument rages-and has always raged-as to whether those actions were the result of unintentional circumstance or part of a deliberate conspiracy. Passions have been raised on both sides and even the most elaborate studies have come to no definite conclusions. Nevertheless, the suspicions that were raised helped poison Leggen\u0027s career and private life in the years that followed... Encyclopedia Galactica 25. It was not quite the end of daylight when Dors Venabili sought out Jenarr Leggen. He answered her rather anxious greeting with a grunt and a brief nod. \"Well,\" she said a trifle impatiently. \"How was he?\" Leggen, who was entering data into his computer, said, \"How was who?\" \"My library student Hari. Dr. Hari Seldon. He went up with you. Was he any help to you?\" Leggen removed his hands from the keys of his computer and swivelled about. \"That Heliconian fellow? He was of no use at all. Showed no interest whatever. He kept looking at the scenery when there was no scenery to look at. A real oddball. Why did you want to send him up?\" \"It wasn\u0027t my idea. He wanted to. I can\u0027t understand it. He was very interested. Where is he now?\" Leggen shrugged. \"How would I know? Somewhere around.\" \"Where did he go after he came down with you? Did he say?\" \"He didn\u0027t come down with us. I told you he wasn\u0027t interested.\" \"Then when did he come down?\" \"I don\u0027t know. I wasn\u0027t watching him. I had an enormous amount of work to do. There must have been a windstorm and some sort of downpour about two days ago and neither was expected. Nothing our instruments showed offered a good explanation for it or for the fact that some sunshine we were expecting today didn\u0027t appear. Now I\u0027m trying to make sense of it and you\u0027re bothering me.\" \"You mean you didn\u0027t see him go down?\" \"Look. He wasn\u0027t on my mind. The idiot wasn\u0027t correctly dressed and I could see that inside of half an hour he wasn\u0027t going to be able to take the cold. I gave him a sweater, but that wasn\u0027t going to help much for his legs and feet. So I left the elevator open for him and I told him how to use it and explained that it would take him down and then return automatically. It was all very simple and I\u0027m sure he did get cold and he did go down and the elevator did come back and then eventually we all went down.\" \"But you don\u0027t know exactly when he went down?\" \"No, I don\u0027t. I told you. I was busy. He certainly wasn\u0027t up there when we left, though, and by that time twilight was coming on and it looked as though it might sleet. So he had to have gone down.\" \"Did anyone else see him go down?\" \"I don\u0027t know. Clowzia may have. She was with him for a while. Why don\u0027t you ask her?\" Dors found Clowzia in her quarters, just emerging from a hot shower. \"It was cold up there,\" she said. Dors said, \"Were you with Hari Seldon Upperside?\" Clowzia said, eyebrows lifting, \"Yes, for a while. He wanted to wander about and ask questions about the vegetation up there. He\u0027s a sharp fellow, Dors. Everything seemed to interest him, so I told him what I could till Leggen called me back. He was in one of his knock-your-head-off tempers. The weather wasn\u0027t working and he-\" Dors interrupted. \"Then you didn\u0027t see Hari go down in the elevator?\" \"I didn\u0027t see him at all after Leggen called me over.-But he has to be down here. He wasn\u0027t up there when we left.\" \"But I can\u0027t find him anywhere.\" Clowzia looked perturbed. \"Really?-But he\u0027s got to be somewhere down here.\" \"No, he doesn\u0027t have to be somewhere down here,\" said Dors, her anxiety growing. \"What if he\u0027s still up there?\" \"That\u0027s impossible. He wasn\u0027t. Naturally, we looked about for him before we left. Leggen had shown him how to go down. He wasn\u0027t properly dressed and it was rotten weather. Leggen told him if he got cold not to wait for us. He was getting cold. I know! So what else could he do but go down?\" \"But no one saw him go down.-Did anything go wrong with him up there?\" \"Nothing. Not while I was with him. He was perfectly fine except that he had to be cold, of course.\" Dors, by now quite unsettled, said, \"Since no one saw him go down, he might still be up there. Shouldn\u0027t we go up and look?\" Clowzia said nervously, \"I told you we looked around before we went down. It was still quite light and he was nowhere in sight.\" \"Let\u0027s look anyway.\" \"But I can\u0027t take you up there. I\u0027m just an intern and I don\u0027t have the combination for the Upperside dome opening. You\u0027ll have to ask Dr. Leggen.\" 26. Dors Venabili knew that Leggen would not willingly go Upperside now. He would have to be forced. First, she checked the library and the dining areas again. Then she called Seldon\u0027s room. Finally, she went up there and signaled at the door. When Seldon did not respond, she had the floor manager open it. He wasn\u0027t there. She questioned some of those who, over the last few weeks, had come to know him. No one had seen him. Well, then, she would make Leggen take her Upperside. By now, though, it was night. He would object strenuously and how long could she spend arguing if Hari Seldon was trapped up there on a freezing night with sleet turning to snow? A thought occurred to her and she rushed to the small University computer, which kept track of the doings of the students, faculty, and service staff. Her fingers flew over the keys and she soon had what she wanted. There were three of them in another part of the campus. She signed out for a small glidecart to take her over and found the domicile she was looking for. Surely, one of them would be available-or findable. Fortune was with her. The first door at which she signaled was answered by a query light. She punched in her identification number, which included her department affiliation. The door opened and a plump middle-aged man stared out at her. He had obviously been washing up before dinner. His dark blond hair was askew and he was not wearing any upper garment. He said, \"Sorry. You catch me at a disadvantage. What can I do for you, Dr. Venabili?\" She said a bit breathlessly, \"You\u0027re Rogen Benastra, the Chief Seismologist, aren\u0027t you?\" \"Yes.\" \"This is an emergency. I must see the seismological records for Upperside for the last few hours.\" Benastra stared at her. \"Why? Nothing\u0027s happened. I\u0027d know if it had. The seismograph would inform us.\" \"I\u0027m not talking about a meteoric impact.\" \"Neither am I. We don\u0027t need a seismograph for that. I\u0027m talking about gravel, pinpoint fractures. Nothing today.\" \"Not that either. Please. Take me to the seismograph and read it for me. This is life or death.\" \"I have a dinner appointment-\" \"I said life or death and I mean it.\" Benastra said, \"I don\u0027t see-\" but he faded out under Dors\u0027s glare. He wiped his face, left quick word on his message relay, end struggled into a shirt. They half-ran (under Dors\u0027s pitiless urging) to the small squat Seismology Building. Dors, who knew nothing about seismology, said, \"Down? We\u0027re going down?\" \"Below the inhabited levels. Of course. The seismograph has to be fixed to bedrock and be removed from the constant clamor and vibration of the city levels.\" \"But how can you tell what\u0027s happening Upperside from down here?\" \"The seismograph is wired to a set of pressure transducers located within the thickness of the dome. The impact of a speck of grit will send the indicator skittering off the screen. We can detect the flattening effect on the dome of a high wind. We can-\" \"Yes, yes,\" said Dors impatiently. She was not here for a lecture on the virtues and refinements of the instruments. \"Can you detect human footsteps?\" \"Human footsteps?\" Benastra looked confused. \"That\u0027s not likely Upperside.\" \"Of course it\u0027s likely. There were a group of meteorologists Upperside this afternoon.\" \"Oh. Well, footsteps would scarcely be noticeable.\" \"It would be noticeable if you looked hard enough and that\u0027s what I want you to do.\" Benastra might have resented the firm note of command in her voice, but, if so, he said nothing. He touched a contact and the computer screen jumped to life. At the extreme right center, there was a fat spot of light, from which a thin horizontal line stretched to the left limit of the screen. There was a tiny wriggle to it, a random non-repetitive seder of little hiccups and these moved steadily leftward. It was almost hypnotic in its effect on Dors. Benastra said, \"That\u0027s as quiet as it can possibly be. Anything you see is the result of changing air pressure above, raindrops maybe, the distant whirr of machinery. There\u0027s nothing up there.\" \"All right, but what about a few hours ago? Check on the records at fifteen hundred today, for instance. Surely, you have some recordings.\" Benastra gave the computer its necessary instructions and for a second or two there was wild chaos on the screen. Then it settled down and again the horizontal line appeared. \"I\u0027ll sensitize it to maximum,\" muttered Benastra. There were now pronounced hiccups and as they staggered leftward they changed in pattern markedly. \"What\u0027s that?\" said Dors. \"Tell me.\" \"Since you say there were people up there, Venabili, I would guess they were footsteps-the shifting of weight, the impact of shoes. I don\u0027t know that I would have guessed it if I hadn\u0027t known about the people up there. Its what we call a benign vibration, not associated with anything we know to be dangerous.\" \"Can you tell how many people are present?\" \"Certainly not by eye. You see, we\u0027re getting a resultant of all the impacts.\" \"You say \u0027not by eye.\u0027 Can the resultant be analyzed into its components by the computer?\" \"I doubt it. These are minimal effects and you have to allow for the inevitable noise. The results would be untrustworthy.\" \"Well then. Move the time forward till the footstep indications stop. Can you make it fast-forward, so to speak?\" \"If I do-the kind of fast-forward you\u0027re speaking of-then it will all just blur into a straight line with a slight haze above and below. What I can do is move it forward in fifteen-minute stages and study it quickly before moving on.\" \"Good. Do that!\" Both watched the screen until Benastra said, \"There\u0027s nothing there now. See?\" There was again a line with nothing but tiny uneven hiccups of noise. \"When did the footsteps stop?\" \"Two hours ago. A trifle more.\" \"And when they stopped were there fewer than there were earlier?\" Benastra looked mildly outraged. \"I couldn\u0027t tell. I don\u0027t think the finest analysis could make a certain decision.\" Dors pressed her lips together. Then she said, \"Are you testing a transducer-is that what you called it-near the meteorological outlet?\" \"Yes, that\u0027s where the instruments are and that\u0027s where the meteorologists would have been.\" Then, unbelievingly, \"Do you want me to try others in the vicinity? One at a time?\" \"No. Stay on this one. But keep on going forward at fifteen-minute intervals. One person may have been left behind and may have made his way back to the instruments.\" Benastra shook his head and muttered something under his breath. The screen shifted again and Dors said sharply, \"What\u0027s that?\" She was pointing. \"I don\u0027t know. Noise.\" \"No. Its periodic. Could it be a single person\u0027s footsteps?\" \"Sure, but it could be a dozen other things too.\" \"It\u0027s coming along at about the time of footsteps, isn\u0027t it?\" Then, after a while, she said, \"Push it forward a little.\" He did and when the screen settled down she said, \"Aren\u0027t those unevennesses getting bigger?\" \"Possibly. We can measure them.\" \"We don\u0027t have to. You can see they\u0027re getting bigger. The footsteps are approaching the transducer. Go forward again. See when they stop.\" After a while Benastra said, \"They stopped twenty or twenty-five minutes ago.\" Then cautiously, \"Whatever they are.\" \"They\u0027re footsteps,\" said Dors with mountain-moving conviction. \"There\u0027s a man up there and while you and I have been fooling around here, he\u0027s collapsed and he\u0027s going to freeze and die. Now don\u0027t say, \u0027Whatever they are!\u0027 Just call Meteorology and get me Jenarr Leggen. Life or death, I tell you. Say so!\" Benastra, lips quivering, had passed the stage where he could possibly resist anything this strange and passionate woman demanded. It took no more than three minutes to get Leggen\u0027s hologram on the message platform. He had been pulled away from his dinner table. There was a napkin in his hand and a suspicious greasiness under his lower lip. His long face was set in a fearful scowl. \" \u0027Life or death?\u0027 What is this? Who are you?\" Then his eye caught Dors, who had moved closer to Benastra so that her image would be seen on Jenarr\u0027s screen. He said, \"You again. This is simple harassment.\" Dors said, \"It is not. I have consulted Rogen Benastra, who is Chief Seismologist at the University. After you and your party had left Upperside, the seismograph shows clear footsteps of one person still there. It\u0027s my student Hari Seldon, who went up there in your care and who is now, quite certainly, lying in a collapsed stupor and may not live long. \"You will, therefore, take me up there right now with whatever equipment may be necessary. If you do not do so immediately, I shall proceed to University security-to the President himself, if necessary. One way or another I\u0027ll get up there and if anything has happened to Hari because you delay one minute, I will see to it that you are hauled in for negligence, incompetence-whatever I can make stick-and will have you lose all status and be thrown out of academic life. And if he\u0027s dead, of course, that\u0027s manslaughter by negligence. Or worse, since I\u0027ve now warned you he\u0027s dying.\" Jenarr, furious, turned to Benastra. \"Did you detect-\" But Dors cut in. \"He told me what he detected and I\u0027ve told you. I do not intend to allow you to bulldoze him into confusion. Are you coming? Now?\" \"Has it occurred to you that you may be mistaken?\" said Jenarr, thin-lipped. \"Do you know what I can do to you if this is a mischievous false alarm? Loss of status works both ways.\" \"Murder doesn\u0027t,\" said Dors. \"I\u0027m ready to chance a trial for malicious mischief. Are you ready to chance a trial for murder?\" Jenarr reddened, perhaps more at the necessity of giving in than at the threat. \"I\u0027ll come, but I\u0027ll have no mercy on you, young woman, if your student eventually turns out to have been safe within the dome these past three hours.\" 27. The three went up the elevator in an inimical silence. Leggen had eaten only part of his dinner and had left his wife at the dining area without adequate explanation. Benastra had eaten no dinner at all and had possibly disappointed some woman companion, also without adequate explanation. Dors Venabili had not eaten either and she seemed the most tense and unhappy of the three. She carried a thermal blanket and two photonic founts. When they reached the entrance to Upperside, Leggen, jaw muscles tightening, entered his identification number and the door opened. A cold wind rushed at them and Benastra grunted. None of the three was adequately dressed, but the two men had no intention of remaining up there long. Dors said tightly, \"It\u0027s snowing.\" Leggen said, \"It\u0027s wet snow. The temperature\u0027s just about at the freezing point. It\u0027s not a killing frost.\" \"It depends on how long one remains in it, doesn\u0027t it?\" said Dors. \"And being soaked in melting snow won\u0027t help.\" Leggen grunted. \"Well, where is he?\" He stared resentfully out into utter blackness, made even worse by the light from the entrance behind him. Dors said, \"Here, Dr. Benastra, hold this blanket for me. And you, Dr. Leggen, close the door behind you without locking it.\" \"There\u0027s no automatic lock on it. Do you think we\u0027re foolish?\" \"Perhaps not, but you can lock it from the inside and leave anyone outside unable to get into the dome.\" \"If someone\u0027s outside, point him out. Show him to me,\" said Leggen. \"He could be anywhere.\" Dors lifted her arms with a photonic fount circling each wrist. \"We can\u0027t look everywhere,\" mumbled Benastra miserably. The founts blazed into light, spraying in every direction. The snowflakes glittered like a vast mob of fireflies, making it even more difficult to see. \"The footsteps were getting steadily louder,\" said Dors. \"He had to be approaching the transducer. Where would it be located?\" \"I haven\u0027t any idea,\" snapped Leggen.-That\u0027s outside my field and my responsibility.\" \"Dr. Benastra?\" Benastra\u0027s reply was hesitant. \"I don\u0027t really know. To tell you the truth, I\u0027ve never been up here before. It was installed before my time. The computer knows, but we never thought to ask it that.-I\u0027m cold and I don\u0027t see what use I am up here.\" \"You\u0027ll have to stay up here for a while,\" said Dors firmly. \"Follow me. I\u0027m going to circle the entrance in an outward spiral.\" \"We can\u0027t see much through the snow,\" said Leggen. \"I know that. If it wasn\u0027t snowing, we\u0027d have seen him by now. I\u0027m sure of it. As it is, it may take a few minutes. We can stand that.\" She was by no means as confident as her words made it appear. She began to walk, swinging her arms, playing the light over as large a field as she could, straining her eyes for a dark blotch against the snow. And, as it happened, it was Benastra who first said, \"What\u0027s that?\" and pointed. Dors overlapped the two founts, making a bright cone of light in the indicated direction. She ran toward it, as did the other two. They had found him, huddled and wet, about ten meters from the door, five from the nearest meteorological device. Dors felt for his heartbeat, but it was not necessary for, responding to her touch, Seldon stirred and whimpered. \"Give me the blanket, Dr. Benastra,\" said Dors in a voice that was faint with relief. She flapped it open and spread it out in the snow. \"Lift him onto it carefully and I\u0027ll wrap him. Then we\u0027ll carry him down.\" In the elevator, vapors were rising from the wrapped Seldon as the blanket warmed to blood temperature. Dors said, \"Once we have him in his room, Dr. Leggen, you get a doctor-a good one-and see that he comes at once. If Dr. Seldon gets through this without harm, I won\u0027t say anything, but only if he does. Remember-\" \"You needn\u0027t lecture me,\" said Leggen coldly. \"I regret this and I will do what I can, but my only fault was in allowing this man to come Upperside in the first place.\" The blanket stirred and a low, weak voice made itself heard. Benastra started, for Seldon\u0027s head was cradled in the crook of his elbow. He said, \"He\u0027s trying to say something.\" Dors said, \"I know. He said, \u0027What\u0027s going on?\u0027 \" She couldn\u0027t help but laugh just a little. It seemed such a normal thing to say. 28. The doctor was delighted. \"I\u0027ve never seen a case of exposure,\" he explained. \"One doesn\u0027t get exposed on Trantor.\" \"That may be,\" said Dors coldly, \"and I\u0027m happy you have the chance to experience this novelty, but does it mean that you do not know how to treat Dr. Seldon?\" The doctor, an elderly man with a bald head and a small gray mustache, bristled. \"Of course, I do. Exposure cases on the Outer Worlds are common enough-an everyday affair-and I\u0027ve read a great deal about them.\" Treatment consisted in part of an antiviral serum and the use of a microwave wrapping. \"This ought to take care of it,\" the doctor said. \"On the Outer Worlds, they make use of much more elaborate equipment in hospitals, but we don\u0027t have that, of course, on Trantor. This is a treatment for mild cases and I\u0027m sure it will do the job.\" Dors thought later, as Seldon was recovering without particular injury, that it was perhaps because he was an Outworlder that he had survived so well. Dark, cold, even snow were not utterly strange to him. A Trantorian probably would have died in a similar case, not so much from physical trauma as from psychic shock. She was not sure of this, of course, since she herself was not a Trantorian either. And, turning her mind away from these thoughts, she pulled up a chair near to Hari\u0027s bed and settled down to wait. 29. On the second morning Seldon stirred awake and looked up at Dors, who sat at his bedside, viewing a book-film and taking notes. In a voice that was almost normal, Seldon said, \"Still here, Dors?\" She put down the book-film. \"I can\u0027t leave you alone, can I? And I don\u0027t trust anyone else.\" \"It seems to me that every time I wake up, I see you. Have you been here all the time?\" \"Sleeping or waking, yes.\" \"But your classes?\" \"I have an assistant who has taken over for a while.\" Dors leaned over and grasped Hari\u0027s hand. Noticing his embarrassment (he was, after all, in bed), she removed it. \"Hari, what happened? I was so frightened.\" Seldon said, \"I have a confession to make.\" \"What is it, Hari?\" \"I thought perhaps you were part of a conspiracy-\" \"A conspiracy?\" she said vehemently. \"I mean, to maneuver me Upperside where I\u0027d be outside University jurisdiction and therefore subject to being picked up by Imperial forces.\" \"But Upperside isn\u0027t outside University jurisdiction. Sector jurisdiction on Trantor is from the planetary center to the sky.\" \"Ah, I didn\u0027t know that. But you didn\u0027t come with me because you said you had a busy schedule and, when I was getting paranoid, I thought you were deliberately abandoning me. Please forgive me. Obviously, it was you who got me down from there. Did anyone else care?\" \"They were busy men,\" said Dors carefully. \"They thought you had come down earlier. I mean, it was a legitimate thought.\" \"Clowzia thought so too?\" \"The young intern? Yes, she did.\" \"Well, it may still have been a conspiracy. Without you, I mean.\" \"No, Hari, it is my fault. I had absolutely no right to let you go Upperside alone. It was my job to protect you. I can\u0027t stop blaming myself for what happened, for you getting lost.\" \"Now, wait a minute,\" said Seldon, suddenly irritated. \"I didn\u0027t get lost. What do you think I am?\" \"I\u0027d like to know what you call it. You were nowhere around when the others left and you didn\u0027t get back to the entrance-or to the neighborhood of the entrance anyway-till well after dark.\" \"But that\u0027s not what happened. I didn\u0027t get lost just because I wandered away and couldn\u0027t find my way back. I told you I was suspecting a conspiracy and I had cause to do so. I\u0027m not totally paranoid.\" \"Well then, what did happen?\" Seldon told her. He had no trouble remembering it in full detail; he had lived with it in nightmare for most of the preceding day. Dors listened with a frown. \"But that\u0027s impossible. A jet-down? Are you sure?\" \"Of course I\u0027m sure. Do you think I was hallucinating?\" \"But the Imperial forces could not have been searching for you. They could not have arrested you Upperside without creating the same ferocious rumpus they would have if they had sent in a police force to arrest you on campus.\" \"Then how do you explain it?\" \"I\u0027m not sure,\" said Dors, \"but it\u0027s possible that the consequences of my failure to go Upperside with you might have been worse than they were and that Hummin will be seriously angry with me.\" \"Then let\u0027s not tell him,\" said Seldon. \"It ended well.\" \"We must tell him,\" said Dors grimly. \"This may not be the end.\" 30. That evening Jenarr Leggen came to visit. It was after dinner and he looked from Dors to Seldon several times, as though wondering what to say. Neither offered to help him, but both waited patiently. He had not impressed either of them as being a master of small talk. Finally he said to Seldon, \"I\u0027ve come to see how you are.\" \"Perfectly well,\" said Seldon, \"except that I\u0027m a little sleepy. Dr. Venabili tells me that the treatment will keep me tired for a few days, presumably so I\u0027m sure of getting needed rest.\" He smiled. \"Frankly, I don\u0027t mind.\" Leggen breathed in deeply, let it out, hesitated, and then, almost as though he was forcing the words out of himself, said, \"I won\u0027t keep you long. I perfectly understand you need to rest. I do want to say, though, that I am sorry it all happened. I should not have assumed-so casually-that you had gone down by yourself. Since you were a tyro, I should have felt more responsible for you. After all, I had agreed to let you come up. I hope you can find it in your heart to... forgive me. That\u0027s really all I wish to say.\" Seldon yawned, putting his hand over his mouth. \"Pardon me.-Since it seems to have turned out well, there need be no hard feelings. In some ways, it was not your fault. I should not have wandered away and, besides, what happened was-\" Dors interrupted. \"Now, Hari, please, no conversation. Just relax. Now, I want to talk to Dr. Leggen just a bit before he goes. In the first place, Dr. Leggen, I quite understand you are concerned about how repercussions from this affair will affect you. I told you there would be no follow-up if Dr. Seldon recovered without ill effects. That seems to be taking place, so you may relax-for now. I would like to ask you about something else and I hope that this time I will have your free cooperation.\" \"I will try, Dr. Venabili,\" said Leggen stiffly. \"Did anything unusual happen during your stay Upperside?\" \"You know it did. I lost Dr. Seldon, something for which I have just apologized.\" \"Obviously I\u0027m not referring to that. Did anything else unusual happen?\" \"No, nothing. Nothing at all.\" Dors looked at Seldon and Seldon frowned. It seemed to him that Dors was trying to check on his story and get an independent account. Did she think he was imagining the search vessel? He would have liked to object heatedly, but she had raised a quieting hand at him, as though she was preventing that very eventuality. He subsided, partly because of this and partly because he really wanted to sleep. He hoped that Leggen would not stay long. \"Are you certain?\" said Dors. \"Were there no intrusions from outside?\" \"No, of course not. Oh-\" \"Yes, Dr. Leggen?\" \"There was a jet-down.\" \"Did that strike you as peculiar?\" \"No, of course not.\" \"Why not?\" \"This sounds very much as though I\u0027m being cross-examined, Dr. Venabili. I don\u0027t much like it.\" \"I can appreciate that, Dr. Leggen, but these questions have something to do with Dr. Seldon\u0027s misadventure. It may be that this whole affair is more complicated than I had thought.\" \"In what way?\" A new edge entered his voice. \"Do you intend to raise new questions, requiring new apologies? In that case, I may find it necessary to withdraw.\" \"Not, perhaps, before you explain how it is you do not find a hovering jet-down a bit peculiar.\" \"Because, my dear woman, a number of meteorological stations on Trantor possess jet-downs for the direct study of clouds and the upper atmosphere. Our own meteorological station does not.\" \"Why not? It would be useful.\" \"Of course. But we\u0027re not competing and we\u0027re not keeping secrets. We will report on our findings; they will report on theirs. It makes sense, therefore, to have a scattering of differences and specializations. It would be foolish to duplicate efforts completely. The money and manpower we might spend on jet-downs can be spent on mesonic refractometers, while others will spend on the first and save on the latter. After all, there may be a great deal of competitiveness and ill feeling among the sectors, but science is one thing-only thing-that holds us together. You know that, I presume,\" he added ironically. \"I do, but isn\u0027t it rather coincidental that someone should be sending a jet-down right to your station on the very day you were going to use the station?\" \"No coincidence at all. We announced that we were going to make measurements on that day and, consequently, some other station thought, very properly, that they might make simultaneous nephelometric measurements-clouds, you know. The results, taken together, would make more sense and be more useful than either taken separately.\" Seldon said suddenly in a rather blurred voice, \"They were just measuring, then?\" He yawned again. \"Yes\" said Leggen. \"What else would they possibly be doing?\" Dors blinked her eyes, as she sometimes did when she was trying to think rapidly. \"That all makes sense. To which station did this particular jet-down belong?\" Leggen shook his head. \"Dr. Venabili, how can you possibly expect me to tell?\" \"I thought that each meteorological jet-down might possibly have its station\u0027s markings on it.\" \"Surely, but I wasn\u0027t looking up and studying it, you know. I had my own work to do and I let them do theirs. When they report, I\u0027ll know whose jet-down it was.\" \"What if they don\u0027t report?\" \"Then I would suppose their instruments failed. That happens sometimes.\" His right fist was clenched. \"Is that all, then?\" \"Wait a moment. Where do you suppose the jet-down might have come from?\" \"It might be any station with jet-downs. On a day\u0027s notice-and they got more than that-one of those vessels can reach us handily from anyplace on the planet.\" \"But who most likely?\" \"Hard to say: Hestelonia, Wye, Ziggoreth, North Damiano. I\u0027d say one of these four was the most likely, but it might be any of forty others at least.\" \"Just one more question, then. Just one. Dr. Leggen, when you announced that your group would be Upperside, did you by any chance say that a mathematician, Dr. Hari Seldon, would be with you.\" A look of apparently deep and honest surprise crossed Leggen\u0027s face, a look that quickly turned contemptuous. \"Why should I list names? Of what interest would that be to anyone?\" \"Very well,\" said Dors. \"The truth of the matter, then, is that Dr. Seldon saw the jet-down and it disturbed him. I am not certain why and apparently his memory is a bit fuzzy on the matter. He more or less ran away from the jet-down, got himself lost, didn\u0027t think of trying to return-or didn\u0027t dare to-till it was well into twilight, and didn\u0027t quite make it back in the dark. You can\u0027t be blamed for that, so let\u0027s forget the whole incident on both sides. \"Agreed,\" said Leggen. \"Good-bye!\" He turned on his heel and left. When he was gone, Dors rose, pulled off Seldon\u0027s slippers gently, straightened him in his bed, and covered him. He was sleeping, of course. Then she sat down and thought. How much of what Leggen had said was true and what might possibly exist under the cover of his words? She did not know.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/prelude-to-foundation-foundation-6/page-7.html","bookId":2020,"book":{"id":2020,"title":"Prelude to Foundation (Foundation #6)","description":"Storyline: Prelude to Foundation (Foundation: Prequel, #1) It is the year 12,020 G.E. and Emperor Cleon I sits uneasily on the Imperial throne of Trantor. Here in the great multidomed capital of the Galactic Empire, forty billion people have created a civilization of unimaginable technological and cultural complexity. Yet Cleon knows there are those who would see him fall - those whom he would destroy if only he could read the future. Hari Seldon has come to Trantor to deliver his paper on psychohistory, his remarkable theory of prediction. Little does the young Outworld mathematician know that he has already sealed his fate and the fate of humanity. For Hari possesses the prophetic power that makes him the most wanted man in the Empire... the man who holds the key to the future - an apocalyptic power to be know forever after as the Foundation.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/prelude-to-foundation-foundation-6.jpg","author":"Isaac Asimov","type":"Fantasy","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/prelude-to-foundation-foundation-6.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:15 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 11:07:52 PM"}}
