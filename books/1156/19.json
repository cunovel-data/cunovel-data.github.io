Before he had an opportunity to utter the words that were on his lips, the young girl\u0027s mother entered the drawing-room. \n \n She was so gay and bright with him, that the mother wondered vaguely if she had forgotten the story which she had told concerning him. \n \n The warning glance which she gave her daughter reminded her that she must act decorously. \n \n The girl was very much in love, and it was easy enough for her to forgive him for having had another sweetheart. \n \n He accompanied mother and daughter to the grand ball. He was so gay and so brilliant and so witty, that he charmed the beautiful Miss St. John more than ever, and he knew by her smiles that his efforts were not in vain. \n \n Ainsley was the very poetry of motion. It was a dream of delight to Florence St. John, as they made the round of the magnificent ball-room, with his arms clasped about her, his handsome face so near her own. \n \n \"Come into the conservatory, Florence,\" he whispered; \"I have something to tell you.\" \n \n How strange it was the scene and the occasion did not cause him to remember that other scene and that[88] other girl whom he had once brought into the conservatory to listen to words of burning love! \n \n \"Florence,\" he whispered, \"I have something to tell you. Will you listen to me?\" \n \n \"Yes,\" she said, her heart beating furiously, for, woman-like, she knew what was coming. The lovely color on her cheeks deepened, the girl\u0027s blue eyes grew luminous and tender. \n \n \"Florence,\" he cried, \"how shall I tell you what I have to say? Oh, Florence, let me tell it quickly, lest my courage fail! I love you, dear—love you as I have never loved any one in my life before!\" \n \n Looking into the dark, handsome face of the young man before her, Florence St. John saw that she was in the presence of a mighty passion—a great love. \n \n In an instant he was kneeling by her side, his whole soul in his eyes and on his lips. It was the very first time in his life that Royal Ainsley\u0027s heart was ever stirred with love. \n \n If Florence St. John had even been poor, he would have cared for her. He started in first by wanting the girl for her money; it ended by his wanting her for herself. \n \n He caught the little hand in his that was carrying the beautiful bouquet of roses he had sent her, and held it tightly. \n \n \"Thank Heaven!\" he said, \"the time has come at last, my beautiful love, for which I have waited so long. Surely you know what I have to tell you, Florence!\" he said, drawing back and looking at her. \n \n \"I haven\u0027t the least idea,\" declared the girl, in whom the spirit of coquetry was strong. \"Really, I do not understand.\" \n \n [89] \n \n \"There needs be no understanding, my beautiful love!\" he cried. \"None! I have come to tell you in words what I have already told you a hundred times in a hundred different ways—I love you with all my heart! I love you! I know no other words. There is none which can tell how dearly or how much all my heart, my soul, my life goes out in those few words—I love you!\" \n \n His voice died away in a whisper. \n \n \"I have a true and serious friendship for you, Mr. Ainsley,\" she answered, coyly; \"but I—I have never thought of such a thing as love or marriage.\" \n \n \"Will you think of it now?\" he answered, eagerly. \n \n He loved her all the more for this sweet, womanly, modest hesitation. \n \n She arose from the seat near the fountain where he had placed her. \n \n \"Well, let it rest in that way,\" she answered. \"I\u0027ll refer the subject to mamma; but you are not to say one word of love to me, nor speak to her about the matter for at least two months.\" \n \n \"Florence, you are cruel,\" he cried, \"to keep me so long in suspense. Tell me, at least, that if your mother favors my suit, I may hope that you are not indifferent to me.\" \n \n But she would not answer him. Her heart beat high, the fever of love throbbed in her veins; but, like all well-bred young girls, she had been schooled by early training to make no sign of preference for any man at his first avowal of affection. As he led her from the conservatory, past the fountain, the fragrant water-lilies, past the green palms and the flowering orchids, he gave a terrible start. \n \n In that moment there came to him the memory of Ida May. He was annoyed by the very thought of her in that hour, and he quickly put it from him. \n \n When they returned to the ball-room, Florence was as sweet as ever; but neither by word or by sign did she betray any rememberance of the scene which had just occurred in the conservatory. \n \n [90] \n \n He left Florence and her mother at the door of their home an hour later, but he did not have the opportunity of holding the little white hand in his for one moment, or of holding even a word of conversation with her. \n \n \"Well,\" said Mrs. St. John, when she and her daughter found themselves alone for a moment, \"I saw him take you to the conservatory. You were gone a long time. Did he propose?\" \n \n \"Yes!\" returned the girl, languidly. \n \n \"Yes!\" echoed Mrs. St. John. \"Why, how can you take it so calmly, my Florence? You accepted him, of course?\" \n \n \"No,\" returned the girl, calmly. \"I said that I would like to have two months to consider the matter before the subject was broached to you.\" \n \n \"You are mad, Florence!\" cried her mother. \"A wealthy young man like that is not captured every day.\" \n \n \"We are not so poor, mamma, that I should make a god of wealth,\" said the girl. \n \n \"Oh, certainly not,\" said her mother; \"but I have always been afraid you would be sought after by some fortune-hunter.\" \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1691/49791.html","bookId":1156,"book":{"id":1156,"title":"A Dangerous Flirtation","description":"简介： Three young girls, as fair as youth and beauty could make them, stood with arms twined about one another on the sands of Newport one hot August afternoon.Neither of the trio could have been over seventeen.
