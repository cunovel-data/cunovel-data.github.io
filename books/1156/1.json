{"id":43195,"no":1,"title":"CHAPTER I.","content":"Three young girls, as fair as youth and beauty could make them, stood with arms twined about one another on the sands of Newport one hot August afternoon. Neither of the trio could have been over seventeen. All three were dressed in white, and looked as delightfully cool, sweet and airy, with their floating white ribbons and wind-blown curls, as summer maidens can possibly look. \"If I were an artist, I would immortalize that glorious scene,\" cried Lily Ryder, her blue eyes sparkling with the fire of enthusiasm. \"And if I were an artist, I would paint you,\" cried a handsome, fair-haired young man sotto voce, who had stopped short in his stroll along the sands with his friend, to admire the three lovely young girls, feeling sure that his keen scrutiny would not be observed, they were gazing so intently out to sea. \"Who are they, Ravenswood?\" he asked, eagerly, turning to his companion. \"You know everyone at[6] Newport worth knowing, of course—\u0027a golden key throws open all doors.\u0027\" \"Oh, of course,\" echoed Philip Ravenswood, with the slow drawl habitual to him. \"They are called at Newport \u0027The Three Graces.\u0027 The blonde fairy to the right is Lily Ryder, an ex-governor\u0027s daughter. The bewitching girl in the center of the group is Miss Hildegarde Cramer, a banker\u0027s daughter; and, by the way, she\u0027s one of the jolliest girls that ever dazzled a fellow\u0027s wits as well as his eyes—looks more bewitching every time you see her.\" \"But who is the other young girl?\" interrupted his companion, impatiently. \"According to my ideas of feminine loveliness, she\u0027s far the prettiest of the three.\" \"Hold on, my dear Royal Ainsley, lest you provoke a duel here and now. Remember, that trio contains the peerless Hildegarde,\" laughed Philip Ravenswood, relighting a fresh Havana. \"All allowance made for difference of opinion,\" smiled Ainsley; \"but really, Phil, who is the dark-eyed beauty this way?\" Little dreaming of what would come of those few idly spoken words, Philip Ravenswood answered, carelessly: \"Her name is Ida May. She\u0027s the only living relative of the Mays of Boston, I understand. I do not know the Mays personally, but know them well by reputation. They are fabulously rich, it is generally believed.\" \"Suppose you introduce me to the Three Graces,\" said Royal Ainsley, banteringly. His companion flushed, and looked a trifle uncomfortable. \"At another time, my dear fellow,\" he said, answering[7] Ainsley\u0027s question after a moment\u0027s pause. \"Let the girls enjoy their rhapsodies over the sunset in peace this time. We really haven\u0027t time just now. The fellows are waiting for us at the club, you know.\" But Ainsley refused to go on; yet he did it in such a gay, off-hand, rollicking, fun-loving fashion, his friend did not see the fixed purpose in his action. He was quite sure that if they stood there long enough they could not help attracting the attention of the pretty maidens, and there was no time like the present to meet them. In this surmise, he was quite correct. Attracted by the sound of voices almost behind them, Miss Ryder glanced around. \"Hildegarde—Ida!\" she exclaimed, in a flutter of delighted surprise, \"why, here is Mr. Ravenswood!\" She stopped short, for just then she observed that the handsome young gentleman in the white linen suit, standing a little apart from Mr. Ravenswood, was with him. It was too late to beat a retreat then, for he had been discovered. He was certainly in for it, and there was no help for it but to bring his companion forward with the best possible grace and present him to the young ladies. Ainsley bowed low in his most charming manner, raising, with a smile, his white straw hat from his fair, clustering hair, and Philip Ravenswood could see, with consternation, the apparent admiration for his friend on all three girlish faces, including Hildegarde, whom he had believed to be quite smitten with himself. Royal Ainsley made the most of that next half hour on the sands. He was so brilliant, so witty, so clever, he fairly astonished his friend, used as he was to his gay[8] bon-mots and to see him the life of all the affairs at the club. They chatted brightly enough, until Hildegarde exclaimed, with a little cry: \"Why, there is some bell striking seven! We have been here over an hour. We must get back to the hotel, girls, or we will never be dressed for dinner. Won\u0027t you stroll back that way with us?\" she added, with a dazzling smile to both of the young gentlemen. \"I think not,\" replied Ainsley, quickly, taking it upon himself to answer for his friend. \"We have an engagement, and have barely time to save ourselves from being the annoying cause of giving our friends a cold dinner.\" \"We hope to see you both soon again,\" said Lily, with another blush. \"We do, indeed!\" echoed Hildegarde, archly. But the girl with the velvet pansy eyes made no audible remark, though her crimson lips parted, then shut quickly again. The next moment the two gentlemen were gone, and the three young girls retraced their steps slowly hotelward along the beach. They had a much pleasanter subject to discuss now than the sunset. \"Isn\u0027t the new-comer handsome?\" remarked Lily. \"Splendid! but not quite as Phil, though.\" Again they both asked together: \"What say you, Ida?\" The girl with cheeks like a damask rose and velvety pansy eyes blushed to the roots of her jetty curls. \"He is like the hero of a novel. I have never seen any one so handsome before—so fair, so smiling—so—so—delightful,\" she answered. [9] \"Ida May\u0027s heart has been hit by the first shot of those arrows of blue eyes,\" laughed Lily, mockingly. \"I knew when she declared that, come what would, she would not fall in love with any young man she met at Newport, she was more than likely to meet her fate.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1691/49773.html","bookId":1156,"book":{"id":1156,"title":"A Dangerous Flirtation","description":"简介： Three young girls, as fair as youth and beauty could make them, stood with arms twined about one another on the sands of Newport one hot August afternoon.Neither of the trio could have been over seventeen.
