{"id":27672,"no":14,"title":"CHAPTER XIII MR. SHALLEY MAKES AN OFFER","content":"The two men conversed together for fully half an hour, and during that time Andrew Shalley learned much concerning the Thompson family and their struggle to make both ends meet. \"I live at Nyack,\" said Andrew Shalley. \"And my headquarters for boats is there also. But the passenger steamer runs from New York City to Albany. The tugs run anywhere on the river, and on New York Bay.\" \"It must be a nice business,\" said Randy. \"I like boats of any kind.\" \"If I had a boat on the river here I might give you a job,\" went on the gentleman. \"But all of my craft are on the Hudson.\" \"They tell me that the Hudson is a grand stream.\" \"Nothing finer in this country, my boy, nothing finer. I have traveled all over the United States and I know. I think it is fully equal to the German Rhine and the St. Lawrence.\" \"Maybe you could give me a situation on one of your Hudson River boats,\" went on Randy, struck by a sudden idea. \"Would you care to leave home?\" \"Oh, Randy, you wouldn\u0027t want to go away!\" cried Mrs. Thompson. \"I would if it paid to do so,\" answered Randy, quickly. \"There isn\u0027t much chance for work in Riverport.\" \"And I can keep an eye on the garden,\" said Mr. Thompson. \"I know I am going to feel some better now this spell is passing.\" \"If you cared to leave home I might give you some sort of a job on one of my boats,\" went on Andrew Shalley, thoughtfully. \"What kind of a job?\" \"I\u0027d have to see about it first. I\u0027ll tell you what I\u0027ll do, I\u0027ll send you a letter next week.\" \"Thank you.\" \"That will be best. But now I am going to do something else.\" The steamboat man drew out his wallet. \"I want you to accept this.\" And he held out five crisp ten-dollar bills. Randy did not wish to take the money, but the steamboat man urged it and finally laid the bills on the table. \"I am sure you are more than kind, Mr. Shalley,\" said Mrs. Thompson. \"I shall remember you.\" \"Let us call it a loan,\" said Mr. Thompson, \"to be paid back when I am at work once more.\" \"Yes, call it a loan,\" said Randy, \"otherwise I, for one, don\u0027t want it.\" \"Have your way,\" laughed Mr. Shalley. \"But don\u0027t worry about the payment.\" Before he left he walked around the little farm and praised what Randy had done. \"Evidently not a lazy boy,\" he told himself, \"and one who is willing to aid his parents. That is the sort I like.\" \"He is a very nice man,\" said Mrs. Thompson, when the visitor had departed. \"Randy, you were fortunate to make such a friend.\" \"Yes. But, mother, I think we ought to pay back that money some day.\" \"I can do that—when I am able to go at carpentering again,\" put in Mr. Thompson. After that a week passed quietly enough. Randy worked early and late and got the little farm in good shape and also visited Jack and bade his friend good-by. \"Maybe I\u0027ll get a position on one of the Hudson River boats,\" said our hero. \"If you do, and you stop at Albany, you must come and see me,\" answered Jack, and gave his new address. On the following Monday came a letter from Andrew Shalley. It was short and to the point and read in part as follows: \"All I can offer you at present is the position of a deckhand on my steamboat, the Helen Shalley. If you wish to accept that I will pay you twenty dollars per month and your board at the start, and more when you are experienced. If you wish to accept, write to me and come on to Nyack, to my office.\" \"Here\u0027s an offer at last!\" cried Randy, as he read the communication. He had been fearful that Andrew Shalley might forget him. \"Twenty dollars per month is not so very much,\" said his mother. \"Yes, but I am to get my board, so the money will all be clear profit, outside of the cost of my clothing.\" \"I suppose you will live on the boat,\" put in Mr. Thompson. \"Most of the crew do.\" \"I can send the most of the money home each month,\" continued Randy. \"The boat won\u0027t run during the winter,\" said his mother, who did not much relish having her son leave home. \"Well, it will run until cold weather, anyway, and perhaps after that Mr. Shalley will give me something else to do.\" The matter was discussed that evening, and before he retired, Randy penned a letter to the steamboat owner, stating he would come to Nyack two days later. The prospects ahead filled our hero with pleasure. The new position would enable him to see a little of the world and meet other people, and he was sure steamboat life would suit him thoroughly. He knew there would be plenty of hard work, handling freight and baggage, but this did not daunt him. \"I\u0027ll try to do my best,\" he reasoned. \"Then maybe Mr. Shalley will give me something better later on.\" Randy did not have many clothes, so there was not a great deal to pack. What he possessed was gone over by his mother, and then packed in a valise. Out of the money on hand he was given the price of his stage and railroad ticket and five dollars for other expenses. \"I shan\u0027t spend only what is necessary,\" said he to his parents. Randy was glad to see that his father was improving. A good deal of the rheumatic pains had left Mr. Thompson and he could get around the house and the garden. It would be some time before he could go at carpentering again, but he could aid a good deal on the farm, which was something. All too soon for his mother came the time for Randy to depart. Mrs. Thompson kissed him affectionately and his father shook him by the hand. \"Come back home if it doesn\u0027t suit you, Randy,\" said the mother. \"Yes, come back, and we\u0027ll get along somehow,\" added his father. \"I am sure it will suit me,\" said the boy. \"I know the kind of a man Mr. Shalley is. We\u0027ll be sure to get along.\" Randy left home early in the morning and half an hour later was on the stage, bound for Leeville, where he was to take the train for Tarrytown, which is directly across the Hudson River from Nyack. His going away was done so quietly that not a dozen persons knew of his departure. The stage was but half filled, so he had plenty of room both for himself and his valise. Arriving at Leeville he had an hour to wait for the train and spent the time in walking around the little town. He had just passed one of the largest stores when he felt a hand on his shoulder and turned, to find himself confronted by Bob Bangs. \"What are you doing here?\" demanded the big boy, rather impudently. \"What business is that of yours?\" retorted Randy, not liking the manner in which he had been addressed. \"Oh, you needn\u0027t answer if you don\u0027t want to,\" sniffed Bob Bangs. \"I am going to Nyack.\" \"To Nyack? What for?\" \"I am going to work for a steamboat owner.\" \"Humph! Going to work on the river?\" \"Yes.\" \"Cabin boy, I suppose,\" sneered the rich boy. \"No, as a deckhand.\" \"I thought so. It\u0027s a dirty enough job, and you are welcome to it.\" \"It\u0027s honest work, and the money is clean,\" answered Randy, warmly. \"Ha! What do you mean by clean money,\" demanded the big boy, suspiciously. \"Just what I said.\" \"Maybe you are trying to help spread that report that the Bartletts started about us,\" said the rich youth. \"What report do you mean, Bob?\" \"You know well enough—the one about my father.\" \"I don\u0027t know.\" \"Ain\u0027t the Bartletts telling everybody that my father shoved \u0027em out of the iron works and that our money wasn\u0027t clean?\" \"I haven\u0027t heard it.\" \"Bah! You needn\u0027t play the innocent. I know you, and I know Jack Bartlett, too.\" \"I don\u0027t think your folks treated the Bartletts just right,\" went on our hero, resolved to stand up for his friends. \"We treated \u0027em better than they deserved. If I had been my father I should have kicked old man Bartlett out.\" \"Your father wouldn\u0027t have dared, Bob Bangs. But I am not going to quarrel with you. What brings you to this place?\" \"That\u0027s my business.\" \"You needn\u0027t tell me if you don\u0027t wish to.\" \"I am here to get a new horse. I am going to ride horseback after this,\" went on the rich boy, boastfully. \"It\u0027s a horse that costs four hundred dollars, too.\" \"Then you are in luck,\" was all Randy answered, and walked away, leaving the rich youth gazing after him doubtfully. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2998/82713.html","bookId":303,"book":{"id":303,"title":"Randy of the River The Adventures of a Young Deckhand","description":"简介： The majority of stories for boys have their background laid either in the city or the country, or possibly on the ocean, and we have read much about the doings of lads both rich and poor in such locations....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2998","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:31 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:31 AM"}}
