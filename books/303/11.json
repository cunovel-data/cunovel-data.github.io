{"id":27669,"no":11,"title":"CHAPTER X SAMMY\u0027S FOURTH OF JULY","content":"The next day Sammy sat on a bench on the cottage stoop, apparently very intent on a perusal of the Farmer\u0027s Almanac, but it was evident his thoughts were somewhere else. \"What in nater is the boy a-doin\u0027?\" asked his mother, looking up from a pile of stockings she was mending. \"If he ain\u0027t twisting up thet Almanac as if \u0027twasn\u0027t any more than a piece of brown paper. What are you thinking about, Sammy?\" \"Thursday is Fourth o\u0027 July,\" answered her son. \"Well, what if it is? I\u0027m sure I\u0027m willing.\" \"They are going to have great doings down to Springfield,\" added Sammy. \"Is that so? I hope they enjoy themselves. But it ain\u0027t anything to me as I know on.\" \"I want to go down an\u0027 see the celebration,\" said Sammy, mustering up his courage to give utterance to so daring a proposition. \"Want to see the Fourth o\u0027 July in Springfield?\" ejaculated his mother. \"Is the boy crazy? Ain\u0027t it the Fourth o\u0027 July here as well as there, I\u0027d like to know?\" \"Well, I suppose it is, but I never was in Springfield, an\u0027 I want to go. They\u0027ve got a lot o\u0027 shows there, an\u0027 I\u0027m bound to see some of \u0027em.\" \"Sammy,\" said his mother, solemnly, \"it would be the ruination of you; you\u0027d git shot, or something wuss. You ain\u0027t nuthin\u0027 but a boy, an\u0027 couldn\u0027t be trusted nohow.\" \"Ain\u0027t I fourteen, an\u0027 ain\u0027t I \u0027most six feet high?\" answered back Sammy, defiantly. \"An\u0027 didn\u0027t Dick Slade, who is only thirteen, go down last Fourth an\u0027 have a smashin\u0027 good time an\u0027 not git hurt?\" \"But you ain\u0027t got no experience, Sammy.\" \"I\u0027ve got enough to go to Springfield.\" \"No, you had better give up the notion.\" \"Now, mother, don\u0027t say that!\" pleaded the son. \"But I do say it.\" \"Well, then I\u0027m going to—to run away! I\u0027ll go to sea an\u0027 be a sailor, or sumthin\u0027!\" burst out Sammy, recklessly. \"I\u0027m sick o\u0027 workin\u0027 every single day!\" \"Stop talking in that dreadful way, Sammy!\" said Mrs. Borden, anxiously. \"Then you ask paw to let me go.\" \"\u0027Twon\u0027t do no good.\" \"Yes, it will. You ask him, won\u0027t you?\" pleaded the son. At last Mrs. Borden consented and spoke to her husband about it during the dinner hour. Jerry Borden shook his head. \"He can\u0027t go—it\u0027s sheer foolishness,\" he said. \"If you don\u0027t let him go I\u0027m afraid he will run away,\" said the wife. \"He has his heart set on going.\" Sammy was out of the room at the time, so he could not hear the talk. At first Mr. Borden would not listen, but at last he gave in, although he added grimly that he thought running away would do Sammy a world of good. \"He\u0027d be mighty glad to sneak back afore a week was up,\" he said. When Sammy realized that he was really to go to the city he was wild with delight, and rushed down into the hayfield to tell Randy of his plans. \"I\u0027m a-goin\u0027 to have a highfalutin\u0027 time,\" he said. \"Just you wait until I come back an\u0027 tell about it.\" \"I hope you do have a good time,\" answered our hero, \"and don\u0027t get hurt.\" \"There won\u0027t nothin\u0027 happen to me,\" answered Sammy, confidently. Early on the morning of Independence Day Sammy stood at the door of the farmhouse arrayed in his Sunday best. His folks were there to see him off. \"My son,\" said Mr. Borden, \"don\u0027t ye be wasteful o\u0027 your money, an\u0027 don\u0027t git in no scrapes.\" \"An\u0027 remember, Sammy, to keep all the Commandments,\" added his mother, as she kissed him tenderly. Soon he was off, down the side road towards the highway, where the stage passed that ran to the railroad station. His walk took him by the Thompson cottage. Randy was at home and fixing up the garden. \"I\u0027m off!\" yelled Sammy, waving his hand. \"Good luck!\" cried Randy, pleasantly. \"Don\u0027t get your head shot off.\" \"He may lose his head without having it shot off,\" remarked Mr. Thompson, who sat on the porch, with his rheumatic side in the sunshine. \"I do not think it very wise to let him go to the city alone,\" put in Mrs. Thompson from the kitchen. Sammy tramped on until he came to the main highway and there waited impatiently for the stage to appear. He got a seat by the driver, and in less than an hour reached the railroad station. He had been on the cars before, yet the ride was much of a novelty. At last the country boy found himself on the streets of Springfield. There was an extra celebration of some sort going on and great crowds flocked on every side. Poor Sammy was completely bewildered, as he was jostled first one way and then another. \"Well, by gosh! If this don\u0027t beat anything I ever see!\" he ejaculated. \"Where in thunder did all the folks come from, anyway?\" Sammy looked so truly rural that he attracted the attention of two street urchins who were standing close by. \"There\u0027s a greeny, I\u0027ll bet a hat!\" said one of them, nudging his companion. \"A regular one and no mistake,\" answered the second urchin. \"Let\u0027s have a little fun out of him.\" \"How?\" \"Just look and you\u0027ll see how I fix him.\" So speaking, he took a bunch of firecrackers from his pocket and, with a pin, attached it to the tail of Sammy\u0027s coat. Then he set the bunch on fire and slipped back into the crowd. Crack! Crack! Bang! The plot took effect. Sammy was aroused from his reverie by explosion after explosion in his immediate rear. He started and leaped into the air in wild amazement. \"By thunder!\" he gasped. \"Is thet a cannon bustin\u0027?\" The crackers continued to go off, and poor Sammy leaped around worse than ever. \"Say, mister, what\u0027s up?\" he asked of a man who was laughing loudly. \"Look behind you,\" answered the man. Sammy did so. One look was enough. He began to bellow like a bull and started off on a run, knocking down several people who happened to be in his way. At last a police officer stopped him. \"What do you mean by making such a disturbance?\" demanded the officer. \"I\u0027m burning up! I\u0027m exploding! Don\u0027t you hear me?\" gasped poor Sammy. \"Pooh! It\u0027s only fire-crackers,\" and the policeman smiled faintly. \"Take \u0027em off, mister, please do!\" pleaded Sammy. \"I\u0027ll give you ten cents for the job!\" \"They are about burned out,\" answered the officer, as the last firecracker went off with an extra loud bang. \"You are safe. Go along with you.\" And he waved his stick. Sammy lost no time in sneaking off. The boy who had played the trick had a good laugh and so did his companion. Soon Sammy heard a band and saw some \"Milingtary,\" as he called them, approaching. The sight of the soldiers with their guns awed him, yet he followed the procession to a grove, where there was more music and also speechmaking. He listened to the orations with wide-open mouth, until he suddenly lost interest when a bit of banana skin was thrown at him, landing directly in the opening. \"Wah!\" he spluttered. \"Who threw thet skin at me?\" He could not find the offender and so roamed around the grove, presently halting before a temporary stand filled with things to eat. He now discovered that he was tremendously hungry. \"Snathers take the expense,\" he muttered to himself. \"I\u0027m a-goin\u0027 to have something to eat if it breaks me.\" He had brought along a lunch from home, but had forgotten it on the train. He approached the stand and looked the stock of eatables over. \"What\u0027s the price o\u0027 them bananas, mister?\" he asked. \"Two cents each.\" \"Well, I suppose if I take two you\u0027ll let me have \u0027em fer three cents.\" \"Couldn\u0027t do it.\" \"Well, who cares, anyway? It\u0027s only four cents. Let me have two.\" The bananas were handed over and Sammy looked for his change. But he only had two cents and a one-dollar bill. \"Can you change that?\" he asked, holding out the bill. \"Certainly,\" answered the standkeeper, and promptly gave the youth a fifty-cent piece and a lot of small change. With his bananas in one hand and his money in another Sammy retired to a distance, to count his change and make sure it was right. While he was buying the fruit a boy in tatters watched him eagerly. Now the boy came up to the country lad. \"Please, mister, won\u0027t you give me some money to buy bread with?\" he asked, in a quivering voice. \"To buy bread with?\" asked Sammy, in astonishment. \"Yes, please—I\u0027m awful hungry.\" \"Ain\u0027t you had nuthin\u0027 to eat to-day?\" \"Not a mouthful.\" Sammy\u0027s compassion was aroused and he began to look over his change. \"Look out for that!\" cried the tattered boy, looking upward suddenly. Sammy\u0027s gaze traveled in the same direction. As his eyes went up the boy in rags grabbed the money in his hand and in an instant was making off through the crowd. The movement was so quick, and the surprise so great, that for the moment Sammy was bereft of speech. At length he recovered sufficiently to shout the single word at the top of his lungs: \"Constable!\" \"What\u0027s the matter?\" asked a policeman, running up. \"Thief! Robbery!\" \"Where is the thief?\" \"He ran off.\" \"Where? In what direction?\" \"I—er—I don\u0027t know,\" stammered Sammy. \"What did he take?\" \"Took all my money.\" \"How much?\" \"Ninety-six cents. It ain\u0027t all—I\u0027ve got two cents left.\" \"Well, if you can point out the thief I\u0027ll arrest him,\" said the policeman. \"Come, we\u0027ll take a look around.\" This was done, but the boy in rags could not be found. \"Drat the luck! I suppose the money is gone fer good!\" groaned Sammy, and he was right. For he never saw either the boy or his cash again. Sammy had expected to remain in the evening and see the fire-works, but now his interest in the celebration was gone. \"Hain\u0027t got but two cents left!\" he groaned. \"Thet won\u0027t buy no supper nor nuthin! It\u0027s lucky I\u0027ve got a train ticket back. But I\u0027ll have to walk to hum from the station, unless they\u0027ll tick me fer the stage ride.\" He walked around, still hoping to meet the lad who had robbed him. His perambulations presently brought him to a spot where there was a pond of water, in which some gold-fish were swimming. The gold-fish caught his eye and he paused to watch them as they darted about. He was leaning over, looking into the pond, when some boys came along on a run. One boy shoved another and he fell up against Sammy. As a consequence the country lad lost his balance and went into the pond with a loud splash. \"Save me!\" he spluttered. \"I can\u0027t swim!\" \"Wade out; it\u0027s only up to your middle!\" sang out a man, and arising, Sammy did as directed. He was covered with mud and slime and presented anything but a nice appearance. \"This is the wust yet!\" he muttered, and felt half like crying. \"I ain\u0027t going to stay here no more—I\u0027m goin\u0027 straight fer hum!\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2998/82710.html","bookId":303,"book":{"id":303,"title":"Randy of the River The Adventures of a Young Deckhand","description":"简介： The majority of stories for boys have their background laid either in the city or the country, or possibly on the ocean, and we have read much about the doings of lads both rich and poor in such locations....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2998","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:31 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:31 AM"}}
