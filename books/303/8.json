{"id":27666,"no":8,"title":"CHAPTER VII MORE TROUBLES FOR RANDY","content":"Two days passed quietly, and Randy did not see or hear anything more of Bob Bangs. Then he learned through Jack that Mrs. Bangs had gone off on a summer trip, taking her son with her. \"I hear there are great changes at the iron works,\" said Randy, to his friend. \"Mr. Bangs, they say, is in charge.\" \"He is, and father is out of it,\" answered Jack, bitterly. \"That is what Mrs. Bangs meant when she said I must be bitter against the family.\" \"Is your father out of it entirely, Jack?\" \"Yes, so far as holding a position is concerned. He still has his stock. But he is afraid that won\u0027t be worth much, if Amos Bangs runs the concern.\" \"What is your father going to do?\" \"He doesn\u0027t know yet. He is trying to connect with some other iron works.\" \"I hope he strikes something good.\" \"So do I, Randy.\" \"I wish I could get something to do, too,\" went on Randy. \"You mean during the summer?\" \"Yes, and maybe later, too.\" \"Why, isn\u0027t your father working?\" \"Not to-day. He has been working in a damp cellar and that brought on his old complaint, rheumatism. He suffers something awful with it. He ought to have a long rest.\" \"He certainly ought not to work in a cellar.\" \"He has already told his boss he couldn\u0027t go at it again,\" answered Randy. \"Have you had a doctor?\" \"Yes, Doctor Case came this morning.\" \"What does he say?\" \"He says rheumatism is hard to cure and that my father will have to take care of himself,\" answered Randy. \"But I must go on now,\" he added. \"I must get some things for mother at the store.\" What Randy said about his father was true. Louis Thompson was suffering very much. He rested on a couch in the sitting room of the cottage, and his wife did what she could to relieve his pain. Several days passed and the rheumatism, instead of growing better, became worse, so that neither Mrs. Thompson nor Randy knew what to do for the sufferer. Then Mr. Thompson\u0027s side began to draw up, and in haste a specialist from the city was called in. He gave some relief, but said it would be a long time before the sufferer would be able to go to work again. \"You must keep off your left leg,\" said the specialist. A few days after that Louis Thompson tried to walk. But the pain was so great he could not stand on the rheumatic limb. He sank on his couch with a groan. \"I cannot do it,\" he gasped. \"Then do not try,\" answered his wife. \"But I must get to work, Lucy. I cannot afford to be idle.\" \"Never mind, Louis; we will get along somehow.\" \"How much did that specialist charge?\" \"Fifty dollars?\" \"And what was Doctor Case\u0027s bill?\" \"Ten dollars.\" \"Sixty dollars! And we had only ninety dollars in the bank! That leaves us only thirty dollars.\" To this Mrs. Thompson did not answer. She had used up nearly ten dollars for medicines, but did not wish to worry her suffering husband by mentioning it. \"If I don\u0027t go to work we\u0027ll all starve to death!\" continued Louis Thompson. \"We\u0027ll manage somehow,\" answered the wife, bravely. Nevertheless, she was much discouraged, and that evening, when her husband was asleep, she and Randy talked the matter over as they sat on the porch in the darkness. \"Mother,\" said Randy, earnestly, \"I don\u0027t want you to feel troubled. You have labored so long for me that it is now my turn. I only want something to do.\" \"My dear child,\" said the mother, \"I do not need to be assured of your willingness. But I am sorry that you should be compelled to give up your vacation and maybe your schooling.\" \"Giving up schooling will not be necessary. I can study in the evenings. I am wondering what I can find to do.\" \"I know so little about such things, Randy, that we must consult someone who is better qualified to give advice in the matter—your Uncle Peter, for instance.\" At this Randy gave a sigh. \"I don\u0027t know Uncle Peter. He never comes here.\" \"That is true,\" answered Mrs. Thompson, with some hesitation. \"But you know he is a business man and has a great deal to attend to. Besides, he has married a lady who is exceedingly fashionable, and I suppose he does not care to bring her to visit such unfashionable folks as we are.\" \"Then,\" said Randy, indignantly, \"I don\u0027t want to trouble him with any of my applications. If he doesn\u0027t think us good enough to visit we won\u0027t force ourselves upon him.\" \"My dear boy, you are too excitable. It may be that it is only his business engagements that have kept him away from us. Besides, you can go to him only for advice; it is quite different from asking assistance.\" Mother and son discussed the situation for fully an hour and at last, in the absence of other plans, it was decided that Randy should go to his uncle the next day and make known his wants. Mr. Thompson was told, early in the morning, and said Randy could do as he thought best. \"But don\u0027t expect too much from your Uncle Peter,\" said the sick man. Peter Thompson was an elder brother to Randy\u0027s father. Early in life he had entered a counting room and ever since had been engaged in mercantile pursuits. At the age of twenty-eight he had married a dashing lady, who was more noted for her fashionable pretensions than for any attractive qualities of the heart. She was now at the head of a very showy establishment, far more pretentious than that over which Mrs. Bangs presided. She knew little about her husband\u0027s relations and cared still less. The town of Riverport was twenty miles distant from Deep Haven, where Peter Thompson resided with his family. A boat ran daily between these places and several others, but Randy did not wish to spend the necessary fare, and so borrowed a bicycle from Jack and made the trip by way of the river road, a safe if not very comfortable highway. Randy had been to Deep Haven several times in years gone by, but, strange as it may seem, had never gone near his uncle\u0027s residence. But he knew where the house was located—a fine brick affair, with a swell front—and leaning his bicycle against a tree, he mounted the stone steps and rang the bell. \"What\u0027s wanted?\" demanded the servant who answered the summons, and she looked Randy over in a supercilious manner, not at all impressed by the modest manner in which he was attired. \"Is Uncle Peter at home?\" asked Randy, politely. \"Who\u0027s Uncle Peter?\" \"Mr. Peter Thompson?\" \"No, he isn\u0027t.\" \"Where is he?\" \"At his store, I expect.\" \"Is Mrs. Thompson at home?\" \"I don\u0027t know. I\u0027ll see. Who shall I say wants to see her?\" \"Randy Thompson.\" Randy was left standing in the elegantly furnished hallway while the servant departed. He could not help but contrast such elegance with his own modest home. \"Come into the drawing room,\" said the servant, briefly, on returning, and ushered him into the finest apartment he had ever entered. Here he was kept waiting for fully quarter of an hour. Then a showily dressed woman swept into the room with a majestic air and fixed a cold stare upon our hero. \"Are you my aunt?\" he asked, somewhat disconcerted by his chilling reception. \"Really, I couldn\u0027t say—not having seen you before,\" she answered. \"My name is Randy Thompson. I am the son of Louis Thompson, of Riverport.\" \"Ah, I see.\" The woman said no more, but seemed to await developments. Randy was greatly embarrassed. His aunt\u0027s coldness repelled him, and he easily saw that he was not a welcome visitor. A touch of pride came to him and he resolved that he would be as unsociable as his relative. \"What can he want of me?\" thought the woman. As Randy said nothing more she grew tired of the stillness and drew herself up once more. \"You must excuse me this morning,\" she said. \"I am particularly engaged. I suppose you know where your uncle\u0027s store is. You will probably find him there.\" And then she rang for the servant to show our hero to the door. He was glad to get out into the open air once more. \"So that is Aunt Grace,\" he mused. \"Well, I don\u0027t know as I shall ever wish to call upon her again. She is as bad as an iceberg for freezing a fellow. No wonder she and mother have never become friends.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2998/82707.html","bookId":303,"book":{"id":303,"title":"Randy of the River The Adventures of a Young Deckhand","description":"简介： The majority of stories for boys have their background laid either in the city or the country, or possibly on the ocean, and we have read much about the doings of lads both rich and poor in such locations....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2998","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:31 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:31 AM"}}
