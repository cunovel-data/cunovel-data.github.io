{"id":27676,"no":18,"title":"CHAPTER XVII THE PURSER HAS HIS SAY","content":"One night, when the steamboat was tied up at Albany, Randy donned his street clothes and hunted up the place where Jack Bartlett lived. He found his former friend at home and glad to see him. \"Come in,\" said Jack, shaking hands. \"How have you been since we met last?\" \"Pretty fair, Jack. And how have you been?\" \"I\u0027m all right. I\u0027ve got a job. That is why I haven\u0027t used my boat pass.\" \"A job?\" \"Yes, I am working in the same place where father has a position.\" \"Then you are not going to school again?\" \"Not for the present.\" Jack lowered his voice. \"You see, father isn\u0027t earning any too much, so I—well, I thought I\u0027d help the family along.\" The two friends sat down in the parlor and our hero told his tale, and then Jack related some of his own experiences. \"My father is in hopes that he can get at Mr. Bangs before long,\" said Jack. \"The trouble is, some papers are missing. He had them in a desk at the works, but when he came away he couldn\u0027t find them.\" \"Perhaps Mr. Bangs got them.\" \"It is possible, but father can\u0027t prove it.\" \"Have you seen or heard anything of Bob Bangs lately?\" \"He is along the Hudson somewhere—on a vacation with his mother.\" \"I met him when he was getting a horse,\" answered our hero and told of what had happened. \"I wish I had been there!\" cried Jack, laughing heartily. \"I\u0027ll wager Bob was as mad as seventeen hornets.\" \"Yes, indeed. He must have had a good bill to pay for damages.\" Randy spent a pleasant two hours with Jack and then went back to the boat, Jack promising to visit the craft some night when the Helen Shalley should tie up at Albany again. So far matters had gone well on board. Randy was much amused by the passengers, especially those who were peculiar in their manners. There was one fussy old gentleman who went up and down the river twice a week. He always wanted to sit in a corner in the shade and asked a dozen times a day if they weren\u0027t behindhand. \"We are exactly on time,\" said Randy, to him, one day. \"Hum!\" cried the old gentleman, consulting a watch he carried. \"I think we are twenty minutes behindhand.\" \"We haven\u0027t been twenty minutes behindhand since I\u0027ve been on the boat,\" said Randy, as he moved off. The old gentleman grumbled to himself and restored his timepiece to his pocket. A minute later Randy saw an Englishman saunter along the deck and stop close to the old gentleman. Randy had noticed the Englishman before, because he spoke with a strong Cockney accent—that is, he dropped h\u0027s where they were wanted and put them in when not needed. At this time the steamboat was just approaching the Highlands. The Englishman pointed to the Highlands with his cane and addressed the old gentleman. \"Hexcuse me,\" he said, \"but are those the \u0027Ighlands you brag about in this country?\" \"The islands?\" was the astonished reply. \"Why, no, sir, those are not islands at all. Have you never studied geography? An island is entirely surrounded by water,\" continued the fussy old gentleman. \"Oh, you mean hilands. I don\u0027t mean them at all, don\u0027t you know. I repeat, are those the \u0027Ighlands you talk about so much?\" went on the Cockney, blandly. \"They are not islands, sir—they are the Highlands,\" shouted the old gentleman. \"Just exactly what I said, sir—the \u0027Ighlands.\" \"No, not islands—Highlands.\" \"Hexactly.\" \"But you said islands.\" \"No, I did not say hilands, I said the \u0027Ighlands,\" went on the Cockney. \"Hevidently you don\u0027t understand good, plain Henglish,\" and he walked off in disgust. \"The imp, the blithering imp,\" growled the old gentleman. \"May he never come near me again!\" At one of the landings a barrel for use on the boat broke, spilling some fancy flour on the deck. Randy was clearing up the muss when the purser, Peter Polk, came along. Our hero did not witness his approach, and consequently the purser received some dust on his shoes, which had just been polished. \"Hi! hi! Have a care there!\" he cried. \"What do you mean by covering me with dust?\" \"Excuse me, sir,\" said Randy, hastily. \"I didn\u0027t see you coming.\" \"I just had those shoes shined!\" \"I am sorry, sir.\" \"You\u0027re the new man, eh?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"You\u0027re a blockhead, it seems to me,\" went on the purser, who was in particularly bad humor that day. An angry remark rose to Randy\u0027s lips, but he repressed it. \"You be more careful in the future, or you\u0027ll get into trouble,\" grumbled the purser, and walked away. The moment the purser was gone Jones came up to our hero. \"Brute, ain\u0027t he?\" he said, in a low voice. \"He called me a blockhead.\" Randy\u0027s eyes were flashing. \"Don\u0027t you mind him, lad. He is sour all the way through—he don\u0027t seem to be able to help it.\" \"I didn\u0027t see him coming.\" \"He should have looked where he was walking.\" \"I don\u0027t wonder the hands don\u0027t like him,\" went on Randy. \"I don\u0027t think Captain Hadley would have spoken so.\" \"Not a bit of it—the captain\u0027s a gentleman, every inch of him.\" \"How do he and the purser get along together?\" \"None too good, so I\u0027ve been told. I wish we had a man in place of Polk.\" \"So do I.\" \"More than likely, when he comes to pay you your wages, he\u0027ll take out the price of a shoe shine.\" \"Would he really be mean enough to do that?\" \"Polk is about mean enough to do anything.\" There the talk ended and Randy finished up his work. The day passed, and when the steamboat tied up that night Randy was more than usually sleepy. It was very warm, and he went on the upper deck to get a breath of fresh air. \"See here,\" said the purser, coming up to him rather suddenly. \"Are you talking about me?\" \"Talking about you?\" repeated our hero, somewhat puzzled. \"That is what I said.\" \"Not particularly, Mr. Polk.\" \"Somebody on this boat is telling tales about me, and I don\u0027t like it.\" To this Randy made no answer. \"Have you heard any stories?\" went on Peter Polk. \"What kind of stories?\" \"That I was going to leave the steamboat?\" \"No, sir.\" \"No stories at all?\" \"No, sir.\" \"Humph!\" And with this the purser walked away. \"What did he want now?\" asked Jones, coming up a little later. \"Wanted to know if I had been circulating stories about him.\" \"Did you tell him no?\" \"I did.\" \"I\u0027ve heard a story—in a roundabout way—that Mr. Shalley is getting tired of the way Polk runs the money matters on this boat.\" \"Does he run all the money matters?\" \"Sure—that is a purser\u0027s business. He does the buying—or most of it—too.\" \"I see.\" \"I don\u0027t believe he buys to advantage,\" went on Jones, closing one eye suggestively. \"I don\u0027t understand.\" \"Maybe he buys at two prices—some of \u0027em do, you know.\" Randy did not know, but he did not say so. \"I knew a purser once—on the Sea Shell—who used to pay one price for a thing and then charge the owners of the vessel another price. At last they caught him at it and sent him to prison.\" This opened Randy\u0027s eyes to what his fellow-deckhand was driving at. \"Do you imagine Polk is that sort?\" \"He is certainly close.\" \"So you said before. Well, he ought to be watched.\" \"Oh, it\u0027s not my affair,\" said Jones. \"Say, I am going to bed,\" he added. \"So am I,\" said Randy, and retired, thinking of what Jones had said and also of what the Clares had told him regarding Peter Polk. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2998/82717.html","bookId":303,"book":{"id":303,"title":"Randy of the River The Adventures of a Young Deckhand","description":"简介： The majority of stories for boys have their background laid either in the city or the country, or possibly on the ocean, and we have read much about the doings of lads both rich and poor in such locations....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2998","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:31 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:31 AM"}}
