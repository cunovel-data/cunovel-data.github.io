{"id":27688,"no":30,"title":"CHAPTER XXVIII OUT OF A TIGHT CORNER","content":"Randy was surprised and dazed by the treatment he received at the hands of the enraged purser and for the moment knew not what to do. He rose slowly to his feet. \"Don\u0027t you do that again!\" he cried, a dangerous glitter coming into his eyes. \"I will do it—unless you give up that letter.\" \"You shall never have the letter, Peter Polk.\" \"Ha! so you admit at last that you have it!\" \"I do.\" \"Then hand it over or I will call an officer and have you locked up.\" \"Call the officer, if you dare,\" and our hero shrugged his shoulders. \"You stole more than the clothing and the letter,\" went on the purser, craftily. \"You took fifty dollars in money.\" \"I took absolutely nothing, and you know it.\" \"Then you want me to call in the officer?\" \"Do as you please,\" said Randy, recklessly. Peter Polk was nonplused. He did not want to call an officer. Yet he wanted to get the precious letter. \"You will save yourself a lot of trouble by giving up that letter, Thompson,\" he said, in a more subdued tone. \"Well, I don\u0027t intend to give it up.\" \"If I have you arrested I can send you to state\u0027s prison for five or ten years.\" \"I will risk it.\" \"What do you intend to do with that letter?\" said the purser. \"That is my affair.\" \"Going to Mr. Shalley, eh?\" \"Perhaps.\" \"It won\u0027t do you any good.\" Again Randy was silent. He had stepped close to the door. On the instant Peter Polk did the same. \"You are not going just yet,\" cried the purser, meaningly. Randy looked through the little window of the office. He heard footsteps approaching. \"Hullo there, Jones!\" he called out. \"What\u0027s wanted?\" came from the other deckhand. \"Come to the office, please.\" In a moment Jones appeared. He was carrying a bucket of water and a deck swab. \"Now open that door,\" said Randy to Peter Polk. \"No more nonsense, please.\" \"You are not wanted here, Jones!\" cried the purser, angrily. \"You are wanted,\" said Randy. \"Open the door. I want to get out.\" Jones set down his pail and pulled on the door. Seeing resistance would be useless, Peter Polk allowed the door to come open. At once Randy stepped out into the gangway. \"I\u0027ll explain this to you some other time!\" he called to the other deckhand, and then ran off before Peter Polk could stop him. \"Where are ye goin\u0027?\" called out Malloy, as he crossed the gang-plank. \"I\u0027m off on business,\" answered our hero, and then paused for a moment. \"Tell Jones to keep an eye on Mr. Polk, will you, please? It is very important.\" \"I will,\" was the reply. In a minute more Randy was hurrying up the street. He knew where Andrew Shalley was stopping and took a car to the location. The place was a well-known hotel and in the corridor he met the steamboat owner, just ready to go out. \"Oh, Mr. Shalley, I want to see you!\" he cried. \"What is it, Randy?\" \"It\u0027s quite a story and very important.\" \"Then come to my room,\" and the steamboat owner led the way to the elevator. As soon as they were in the room our hero told his story in all of its details and then produced the letter he had found. Andrew Shalley listened closely to the story and pondered over the letter for some time. \"Randy, have you any idea who this person who signs himself G. A. G. can be?\" \"I\u0027ve been thinking that over, Mr. Shalley, and I have found out that there is a head clerk who works for Bann \u0026 Shadow, the wholesale grocers, whose name is George A. Gaffney. Gaffney used to come and see Polk once in a while.\" \"And we buy a great many things from Bann \u0026 Shadow,\" put in the steamboat owner. \"So we do.\" \"I will look this man Gaffney up at once.\" With the steamboat owner to think was to act, and going below with our hero he consulted a directory and found that George A. Gaffney lived on West Twenty-sixth Street. \"I will call upon this fellow,\" said he. \"You can go along.\" They took a car on one of the avenues and got out at the corner of Twenty-sixth Street. They had to walk half a block. The neighborhood was not of the best, and Gaffney\u0027s residence proved to be a four-story apartment house. The man lived on the top floor with his wife and four small children. George Gaffney was at home, sitting in his shirt sleeves by a front window, smoking a pipe. He was surprised to receive visitors at that hour. \"Is this Mr. George A. Gaffney?\" questioned Andrew Shalley. \"That\u0027s my name.\" \"Are you a clerk for Bann \u0026 Shadow, the wholesale grocers?\" \"I am.\" \"I would like to see you privately, Mr. Gaffney.\" \"Who are you?\" \"I am Andrew Shalley, the owner of the steamboat Helen Shalley.\" \"Oh!\" George Gaffney was taken aback and showed it plainly. His wife had come to a back doorway and was looking at the visitors curiously. \"Step in, sir,\" said the clerk, in a husky voice. \"Mary, I will see this gentleman alone,\" he went on to his wife, who at once retired, closing the door after her. Andrew Shalley was a good judge of character and he saw that George Gaffney was a family man of fairly good qualities. He was extremely nervous. \"I think I can get him to confess easily enough—if he has anything to tell,\" thought the steamboat owner. \"Please be seated,\" said the clerk, and Mr. Shalley and Randy sat down. Then there was a slight pause. \"Mr. Gaffney, I am afraid I have an unpleasant duty to perform,\" began Andrew Shalley, in a cold, hard voice. \"Why—er—what do you mean?\" stammered the clerk. \"I refer to your dealings with my purser, Peter Polk.\" \"I—er—I haven\u0027t had anything to do with him—that is—we had some little business, but——\" The clerk was unable to go on. \"You sent him a threatening letter the other day.\" \"Me? Who says so?\" \"I have the letter in my possession.\" The clerk winced and the steamboat owner saw that the shot struck home. \"This affair is a very serious one—you know that as well as I do,\" continued Andrew Shalley. \"The fact of the matter is, it is a state\u0027s prison offense.\" The mention of prison had the desired effect. George Gaffney broke down completely. \"Oh, sir,—I—I didn\u0027t mean to do any wrong—Polk said it would be all right. He got me to go into it—it was all his doings. All I ever got out of it was thirty-five dollars and that I will pay back. Mr. Shalley, I—er—I hope you won\u0027t prosecute me, for the sake of my wife and children!\" And the clerk wrung his hands in despair. \"Didn\u0027t you get any more than thirty-five dollars?\" \"No, sir, not a cent more, I swear it. And Polk said that was due to me legally.\" \"If that is true, I will not prosecute you,—but on one condition.\" \"Name it.\" \"That you tell me everything you know about Peter Polk\u0027s doings.\" \"I will do it, Mr. Shalley.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2998/82729.html","bookId":303,"book":{"id":303,"title":"Randy of the River The Adventures of a Young Deckhand","description":"简介： The majority of stories for boys have their background laid either in the city or the country, or possibly on the ocean, and we have read much about the doings of lads both rich and poor in such locations....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2998","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:31 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:31 AM"}}
