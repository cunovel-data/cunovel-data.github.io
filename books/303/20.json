{"id":27678,"no":20,"title":"CHAPTER XIX AN UNLOOKED-FOR ENCOUNTER","content":"It was now early in September and the travel down the river was particularly heavy, for many folks who had been away for a vacation were returning to the metropolis. Baggage kept pouring in until the lower deck was practically filled. \"This is a banner season, so Malloy tells me,\" said Jones to Randy. \"I know there is lots of work,\" answered our hero, whose arms ached not a little. \"Never mind, I\u0027ve got good news.\" \"What is that?\" \"Mr. Shalley is going to allow us an extra five dollars this month.\" \"Good enough.\" Randy had received several letters from home. Matters were going smoothly and Mr. Thompson was feeling better every day. The garden was doing finely. In one letter Mrs. Thompson wrote that there had been two strikes at the iron works, each due to Mr. Bangs\u0027 overbearing manner towards his workmen. \"I thought he\u0027d have trouble sooner or later,\" said Randy to himself, as he perused the communication. \"What a pity that Mr. Bartlett isn\u0027t in charge.\" One fine afternoon the Helen Shalley was steaming down the river as usual and Randy was near the bow, coiling up a hawser, when he noticed a sloop some distance ahead. It was tacking in an uncertain manner, as if the party on board did not know much about sailing such a craft. The sloop was directly in the path of the big steamboat, and the latter gave a warning whistle and then turned to one side. As she did this the sloop turned in the same direction. \"Hullo! What does that fellow in the sloop mean?\" cried Randy to Jones, who was near. \"What\u0027s the matter?\" \"He\u0027ll be run down if he doesn\u0027t look out.\" \"Some fool that doesn\u0027t know how to sail a boat, I guess,\" said the other deckhand. Swiftly the steamboat and the sloop drew close to one another. The big boat let out another warning blast, and again the pilot turned her out of her course. But the sloop also turned. \"There is only one young fellow on board,\" said Jones. \"Look, he acts as if he was scared out of his wits.\" \"I know him!\" fairly shouted our hero. \"You do?\" \"Yes, it is Bob Bangs, the rich young fellow I told you about.\" \"The fellow who couldn\u0027t manage his hoss?\" \"The same.\" \"Well, he doesn\u0027t seem to know no more about his boat than he did about that hoss,\" was the deckhand\u0027s comment. \"We are going to run into him!\" gasped Randy. \"No, he is going to run into us.\" \"It will amount to the same thing—so far as he is concerned.\" \"Maybe—but it will be his fault if he gets drowned.\" Another warning whistle now rang out, but was of no avail. The sloop swerved again and then came squarely up to the big steamboat, which was now backing water furiously. \"Stop! Don\u0027t run me down!\" screamed Bob Bangs. He was fairly white with terror. His cries were cut short by the crash as the sloop struck. The bow was splintered, and the shock threw Bob Bangs overboard. Luckily he was far enough away to escape the paddle-wheel, as the Helen Shalley continued to go ahead despite the fact that her engines had been reversed. The first surprise over, Randy was quick to act. Not far away was a life preserver having a line attached to it and this he took from its hooks. He waited for the rich boy to appear. Soon he came up, spluttering. \"Catch the preserver!\" called out our hero and cast the article in such a skillful manner that it fell within easy reach. \"Save me! Save me!\" gasped the rich youth, throwing his arms wildly about him. \"Take hold of the life preserver!\" called out half a hundred people at once. Then several other cries rang out. At last the motion of the water washed the life preserver up against Bob Bangs\u0027 arm. He clutched at it desperately. By this time the steamboat had come to a standstill, and it was an easy matter for Randy and Jones to pull the rich youth towards the vessel. Then a rope ladder was lowered and Bob Bangs came up to the deck, dripping with water. Bob Bangs being hoisted out of the water. \"Well, young man, you had a narrow escape,\" said Captain Hadley, as he pushed his way through the crowd to the spot. \"I know it, and it\u0027s all your fault!\" whined Bob Bangs. \"My fault? Nonsense!\" \"You ran me down! I\u0027ll have the law on you for it.\" \"Don\u0027t talk like a fool, young man. I was in the wheelhouse myself with the pilot and saw just how you acted. Evidently you don\u0027t know much about handling boats.\" \"I know all about them,\" insisted the rich youth. But this was a falsehood, as Randy well knew. Bob could row and that was about all. \"You\u0027ll have to pay for smashing my boat,\" went on the rich boy, after a pause. \"And you\u0027ll have to pay for wetting my new suit,\" he added, gazing ruefully at the natty outing suit he had donned but an hour before. \"You\u0027ll not get a cent out of me,\" said Captain Hadley, firmly. \"This accident was clearly of your own making. We gave you plenty of room, but you turned directly into our course twice. Be thankful that you weren\u0027t ground up under the paddle-wheel.\" \"Yes, and be thankful that Randy Thompson threw you a life preserver,\" put in Jones. At the mention of our hero\u0027s name Bob Bangs looked around in surprise. He had not noticed Randy before. \"What, you here!\" he exclaimed and did not seem particularly happy over the meeting. \"I am,\" answered Randy. \"Did you throw out that line with the preserver?\" asked the captain. \"I did, sir,\" and Randy touched his cap. \"I am glad to know it,\" and the captain\u0027s face showed his appreciation of Randy\u0027s prompt action. \"What are you doing here—in that outfit?\" asked Bob Bangs, curiously. \"I am a deckhand on this steamboat.\" \"Pooh! a deckhand!\" and the rich boy\u0027s nose went up into the air in disdain. He would give Randy no credit for helping to save his life. \"Clear the deck, please!\" called out Captain Hadley, to the crowd that was pressing in on all sides. \"The excitement is over. The boy is safe.\" \"I want you to put me ashore,\" said Bob Bangs. \"We\u0027ll make a landing a mile below here,\" said the Captain. \"I don\u0027t want to go to the next landing.\" \"Sorry, but we can\u0027t turn back,\" answered Captain Hadley. \"What about my boat?\" \"We\u0027ll take it in tow.\" This was done, and in a few minutes the Helen Shalley had resumed her journey. Bob Bangs was led to one of the staterooms and offered a dry suit of clothes, which he put on. \"I\u0027ll take your name and address,\" said Captain Hadley. \"What for?\" \"As a matter of record. And remember, I want the clothing returned.\" \"Humph! Maybe my father will sue you for damages!\" \"If he does he will lose the case.\" Inside of five minutes the next landing place was made, and Bob Bangs went ashore, taking his wet suit with him. The damaged sloop was tied up at the dock, and having discharged and taken on passengers and baggage the steamboat sped on her way once more. \"He\u0027s as mad as a wet hen,\" said Jones to Randy. \"And he ought to be thankful for having his life spared.\" \"He always was a mean sort of fellow,\" answered our hero. \"And his folks are just as mean as he is.\" \"Then maybe they will try to make trouble for the steamboat owner.\" Amos Bangs did try to make trouble. Two days after the accident on the river Andrew Shalley received a letter which ran in part as follows: \"As you perhaps know, my son, Robert Bangs, was out on the Hudson on the 6th inst., in his sloop, when, without any cause whatsoever, your steamboat, the Helen Shalley, ran into his boat, smashed it completely and put him in peril of his life. \"I am a man of few words, sir, and I demand damages for this outrage. If you wish to settle, you may send me your check for one thousand dollars; if not, I will sue you for that amount.\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2998/82719.html","bookId":303,"book":{"id":303,"title":"Randy of the River The Adventures of a Young Deckhand","description":"简介： The majority of stories for boys have their background laid either in the city or the country, or possibly on the ocean, and we have read much about the doings of lads both rich and poor in such locations....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2998","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:31 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:31 AM"}}
