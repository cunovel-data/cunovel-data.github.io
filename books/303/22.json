{"id":27680,"no":22,"title":"CHAPTER XXI RANDY VISITS HIS HOME","content":"As soon as he returned to the steamboat, Randy acquainted Captain Hadley with all he had seen and heard and gave the captain the card of the merchant. \"You have done well, Randy,\" said the master of the steamboat. \"I fancy this will cook Mr. Amos Bangs\u0027s goose.\" At Nyack, Mr. Shalley came on board and heard what our hero had to say. \"I am glad you have a witness,\" said he. \"I have heard of Mr. Budmister before.\" \"A good business man,\" said Captain Hadley. \"He will make a good witness—if the case comes to a trial.\" But it never did come to a trial. Andrew Shalley received one letter from a lawyer, threatening the suit, and in return wrote back the particulars of what Randy had learned, and added that if he heard any more of the matter he would bring suit against Amos Bangs for conspiracy to defraud. There the matter ended. The captain was so pleased that when Randy asked for a three-days\u0027 leave of absence, that he might visit his home, it was readily granted. The boy was also given some extra pay for his work at Catskill. Randy\u0027s homecoming brought a warm smile to the faces of his father and his mother. His mother kissed him tenderly and his father shook hands. \"How are you feeling, father?\" \"I am almost well, Randy. I expect to go to work next week.\" \"But not in a cellar,\" said the son, quickly. \"No, Mr. Jackson is going to build a wing on his house and has given me the whole contract.\" \"That is good.\" \"I will be able to make more money than if I was working for a boss,\" went on Mr. Thompson. \"Well, you won\u0027t be sorry for that,\" said Randy, with a smile. He found matters on the farm moving along nicely. The late vegetables were coming in well and their neighbor, Jerry Borden, had given them a helping hand. \"Say, you\u0027re a-gittin\u0027 to be a regular sailor, ain\u0027t you?\" said Sammy to Randy. \"Hardly a sailor,\" answered Randy, with a laugh. \"I am a steamboat deckhand.\" \"It\u0027s about the same thing. Wish I was a sailor.\" \"Maybe if you sailed on the ocean you\u0027d get seasick, Sammy.\" \"I wouldn\u0027t, nuther. I was readin\u0027 about Robinson Crusoe onct. I wish I was cast away on a barren island. It would be lots of fun.\" \"Especially if you had nothing to eat and to drink.\" \"Oh, I\u0027d get something from the ship, as Crusoe did.\" \"If the ship didn\u0027t go down in the middle of the ocean.\" \"When I was on the island I\u0027d sleep every morning as long as I wanted to.\" \"What would you do if the savages came after you?\" \"I\u0027d fight and kill them all—that is, all but one. I\u0027d want that one for my man Friday.\" \"He ain\u0027t going to be no sailor,\" broke in Mrs. Borden, who overheard the conversation. \"He is going out to hunt eggs an\u0027 he is a-goin\u0027 to do it right now, or I\u0027ll get the whip.\" \"I\u0027ll get the eggs,\" answered Sammy, and hurried off without further delay. \"That boy is crazy to go somewhere all the time,\" said Mrs. Borden. \"He doesn\u0027t seem to like the farm a bit.\" \"Better let him look for work somewhere,\" said Randy. \"Maybe it will cure him of some of his notions.\" \"Maybe,\" sighed the mother. All too soon Randy\u0027s visit had come to an end. He remained at the little farm over Sunday, going to church with his father and his mother, and left for the Hudson River early Monday morning. Several days passed quietly and once more our hero fell into his routine work. Jones was sick, so the deckhands had a little more to do than usual. Randy pitched in with vigor, much to the satisfaction of Malloy and Captain Hadley. One day, while handling baggage at the dock in New York, Randy was surprised to see Amos Bangs and a stranger come aboard. He soon lost sight of the pair and did not see them again until the middle of the afternoon, when he discovered them in a corner of the cabin, talking earnestly. \"It is queer Mr. Bangs should use this boat—after his quarrel with Captain Hadley and Mr. Shalley,\" said our hero to himself. He had occasion to pass the pair a little later and was surprised to hear the name of Mr. Bartlett mentioned. \"Don\u0027t worry; we\u0027ll down Bartlett easily enough,\" said the strange man, a fellow with bushy black whiskers. \"I hope so,\" answered Amos Bangs. Curious to know what they could be saying about Jack\u0027s father, and remembering what he had heard in the past, Randy walked outside of the cabin and close to a window which was wide open. From this point he could hear what was said without being seen very readily. \"I don\u0027t like the way matters are standing,\" he heard Amos Bangs say. \"We must make our position more secure, Tuller.\" \"I don\u0027t see how we are to do it,\" answered the man with the heavy whiskers. \"I wish I could get Bartlett to sell his stock and sign over all his interest.\" \"Can you do that without making him suspicious of what is going on?\" \"Humph! He is suspicious already, that\u0027s the trouble.\" \"Does he know about the deal with Kastner?\" \"I think not.\" \"It will be a blow, when he hears of it.\" \"I don\u0027t intend he shall hear of it just yet. If I had Robinson where I wanted him, I\u0027d go ahead.\" \"Can\u0027t you get him?\" \"Get him? I don\u0027t dare breathe a word to him.\" Amos Bangs laughed. \"And the funny part of it is, Bartlett thinks Robinson is in with us.\" \"You are sure of that?\" \"Dead certain.\" \"Then you must keep Bartlett and Robinson apart.\" \"If I can.\" \"What did you do with the papers you took from Bartlett\u0027s desk?\" \"They are in my safe at home.\" \"Why don\u0027t you destroy them?\" \"I will, some time.\" \"It is dangerous to leave them around.\" \"I am the only person who knows the combination of the house safe. The papers can\u0027t get out without me.\" So the talk ran on for a good hour, during which time Randy heard many things which appeared to be of value to Mr. Philip Bartlett. Then the two men arose and went to the smoking room, and that was the last our hero saw of them until they left the boat, half an hour later. The talk he had heard set Randy to thinking. Plainly Amos Bangs and his companion were a pair of rascals and were trying to defraud Mr. Bartlett out of some if not all of his belongings. \"I\u0027ll have to call on Mr. Bartlett and tell him what I have heard,\" Randy told himself. \"See here!\" called out Peter Polk, striding up as Randy was going to the lower deck. \"What are you loafing around here for?\" \"I am going below now,\" answered our hero. \"You can\u0027t shirk your work that way, Thompson.\" The purser came closer. \"Listen,\" he whispered. \"After this you keep your nose out of my business.\" \"I didn\u0027t know I had my nose in your business, Mr. Polk.\" \"Oh, you can\u0027t fool me, Thompson. I know it was you went to Captain Hadley with the story of how I was treating my relatives.\" \"You mean the Clares?\" \"Of course I do. After this you keep your mouth shut,\" pursued the purser. \"If you don\u0027t—well, you\u0027ll wish you had, that\u0027s all.\" And Peter Polk went away in extremely bad humor. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2998/82721.html","bookId":303,"book":{"id":303,"title":"Randy of the River The Adventures of a Young Deckhand","description":"简介： The majority of stories for boys have their background laid either in the city or the country, or possibly on the ocean, and we have read much about the doings of lads both rich and poor in such locations....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2998","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:31 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:31 AM"}}
