{"id":27690,"no":32,"title":"CHAPTER XXX A SWIM FOR LIFE","content":"The shock came so suddenly that for the moment poor Randy scarcely realized what was happening. He went down and down and swallowed not a little of the river water. When he came up, blowing and spluttering, he could see but little around him. Fortunately, he had gone off to the rear of the steamboat, thus escaping the danger of being struck by a paddle-wheel. All was so dark and the rain was so thick he could not make out the shore line. \"I\u0027ve got to swim for it,\" he reasoned and struck out bravely. It was no easy matter to keep afloat with so much clothing on. He listened, thinking he might hear the steamboat, but the roaring of the wind and rain drowned out every other sound. Presently came another flash of lightning and then he saw the boat far ahead of him. No one but Peter Polk had witnessed his fall from the deck and nobody appeared to be coming to his assistance. He kept his head well above water and at the next flash of lightning caught a glimpse of one of the river banks. Without further hesitation he struck out in that direction. It was a long and exhausting swim and poor Randy thought he would never reach the shore. The current carried him far down the river, to where there was a small cove, lined with rocks on one side and bushes and trees on the other. He caught at some of the bushes desperately and at last pulled himself to a place of temporary safety. For the time being our hero did nothing but try to get back his breath and his strength. In a general way he had an idea that he was some distance below the town of Catskill. What to do next he hardly knew. \"The first thing to do is to get out of this storm, I suppose,\" he told himself. \"But that won\u0027t do a great deal of good, since I can\u0027t get any wetter than I already am.\" Feeling a little bit rested, he presently got up and walked around the edge of the cove. Then he began to climb the river bank proper. It was hard work, but soon he came out on a river roadway and saw at a distance a hotel and half a dozen fashionable cottages. \"This looks familiar,\" he told himself. \"Well, I declare, that place yonder must be the house at which Bob Bangs and his mother are stopping!\" Back of the house was a big barn and further to the rear was another building, used as a summerhouse and a place where oars and other things for small boats might be stored. The summer storm was now letting up a bit. It was still raining, but the thunder and lightning had ceased and the wind had gone down. To get out of the rain and rest, Randy took himself to the summerhouse. He was busy emptying the water from his shoes, when he heard somebody utter an exclamation and turning saw Bob Bangs standing near, umbrella in hand. The rich youth was staring at him in astonishment. \"Where did you come from?\" he demanded, as he entered the summerhouse. \"From the river.\" \"You look pretty wet.\" \"I have been in the water quite some time.\" \"Oh! Did you fall overboard from the steamboat?\" \"I did.\" \"You must be pretty careless,\" went on Bob, with a sneer. \"I certainly didn\u0027t fall overboard because I wanted to,\" answered Randy as lightly as he could. \"Say, I understand you are trying to get my father into trouble,\" pursued the rich boy, throwing himself on a bench. \"Who told you that?\" \"Never mind. You are hand-in-glove with the Bartlett crowd.\" \"Well, why shouldn\u0027t I be, Bob Bangs? Jack is my dearest friend.\" \"Humph! I shouldn\u0027t care for him for a friend.\" \"And he wouldn\u0027t pick you for a chum,\" added Jack, quickly. \"I consider myself better than Jack Bartlett.\" To this our hero did not answer. \"My dad is going to make it hot for old Bartlett,\" went on Bob. \"He is going to sue him for defamation of character.\" \"When?\" \"Oh, before a great while. Bartlett had no right to search our house and break open the safe.\" \"He had the law on his side.\" \"No, he didn\u0027t. Just you wait till my dad brings suit. It will ruin the Bartletts.\" \"I hope not.\" \"How do you like being a steamboat deckhand?\" went on the rich youth, to change the subject. \"Very well.\" \"It must be a dirty job,\" and Bob Bangs tilted his nose in the air. \"It might be worse.\" \"When I leave school I am going to be a lawyer.\" \"I hope you make a success of it.\" \"I shall—I am going to be one of the greatest lawyers in this country,\" added the rich boy, boastfully. \"Are your folks here?\" \"My mother is. Dad is at the iron works.\" \"They tell me he isn\u0027t doing very well there,\" said Randy. \"He is doing fine. He discharged some of the good-for-nothing hands, that\u0027s all. Bartlett used to hire a lot of sticks.\" \"I don\u0027t believe it. Mr. Bartlett knows his business.\" \"Humph!\" The rain was letting up and Randy prepared to walk to Catskill. As wet as he was, he resolved not to ask any favor at the hands of Bob Banks. \"Going, eh?\" said the rich youth. \"Yes.\" \"Humph!\" murmured Bob Bangs, and that was all he said. Despite the steady rain, Randy walked rapidly to the town—doing this that he might not take cold. Once at the town he hurried to the steamboat landing. \"Hullo, where did you come from?\" exclaimed the dock master, who knew him well. \"From a bath,\" answered Randy with a laugh, and then said he had fallen overboard from the Helen Shalley just before the landing at Catskill was made. \"Nobody said anything about it,\" said the dock master. \"I guess they didn\u0027t know it,\" answered our hero. \"What are you going to do now?\" \"Telegraph to Captain Hadley and then stay in town until the boat comes back to-morrow.\" \"Better get dried off first. You can come to my house if you wish. It is not far off.\" \"Thank you, Mr. Ball.\" Randy\u0027s telegram was a short one. It ran as follows: \"Fell overboard. Am safe at Catskill. Join boat to-morrow.\" The telegram sent, our hero went with Mr. Ball to the latter\u0027s house. Here he was loaned some dry clothing and Mrs. Ball treated him to a late but satisfying supper. After the meal was over, and as it was now clear, he decided to take a walk around the town before retiring. Had he known of what that walk was to reveal he would have been very much surprised.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2998/82731.html","bookId":303,"book":{"id":303,"title":"Randy of the River The Adventures of a Young Deckhand","description":"简介： The majority of stories for boys have their background laid either in the city or the country, or possibly on the ocean, and we have read much about the doings of lads both rich and poor in such locations....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2998","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:31 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:31 AM"}}
