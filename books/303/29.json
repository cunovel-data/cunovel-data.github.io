{"id":27687,"no":29,"title":"CHAPTER XXVII RANDY MAKES A DISCOVERY","content":"The next day Randy wanted to change some of his underwear and went into his locker for his things. To his surprise he found in the locker a lot of wearing apparel that did not belong to him. \"Hullo, what does this mean?\" he asked himself but could not answer the question. He looked the articles over and made sure they did not belong to any of the other deckhands. Then as he was folding up an extra-fine outing shirt, he saw a letter drop to the floor. He picked it up and saw that it was addressed to Peter Polk. \"Can these things belong to Polk?\" he asked himself. \"If so, how did they get here?\" Curiosity prompted him to look into the envelope in his hand. Inside was a single sheet of paper on which was scrawled in a bold, heavy hand this brief communication: \"Peter Polk: If you don\u0027t pay me that commission of twenty dollars at once, I will go to old man Shalley and let him know how you are boosting up the expense account. G. A. G.\" Randy read the letter with great interest. It was postmarked New York and the date was four days back. \"There is some mystery here,\" he reasoned. \"What can it mean? Can Mr. Polk be cheating Mr. Shalley in some way?\" Then he remembered how the purser purchased all the supplies for the steamboat and paid the bills, and gave a low whistle. \"I must see Captain Hadley about this, and at once,\" he thought. \"But no, maybe it would be better to go and see Mr. Shalley direct.\" He placed the letter in a safe place and then went out on deck. He had just started to look for Captain Hadley,—to tell him about the strange wearing apparel—when Peter Polk rushed up to him. \"Look here, Thompson, I want you!\" shouted the purser, wrathfully. \"What is it, Mr. Polk?\" \"I\u0027ve got you, you young thief!\" \"I am no thief,\" answered our hero, warmly. \"You are!\" \"Who says Randy is a thafe?\" demanded Pat Malloy. \"I do.\" \"And I say it is false.\" \"He has stolen some of my underwear,\" went on the purser. \"Tell me what you have done with the stuff at once!\" \"Your stuff is in my locker, Mr. Polk, but I did not take it.\" \"Ha! what a yarn to tell. Hand the stuff over at once!\" \"You can get it if you wish,\" answered Randy, with a shrug of his shoulders. \"I will. Malloy, come along as a witness,\" answered the purser. He walked to the compartment where the deckhands slept and from our hero\u0027s locker hauled the articles that belonged to him. \"What do you say to that?\" he cried, turning to our hero. \"I did not put the things there, Mr. Polk.\" \"If you didn\u0027t, who did?\" sneered the purser. \"Perhaps you did yourself.\" \"Me!\" \"Yes.\" \"You are crazy, boy! Why should I do such a thing?\" \"To get me into trouble. You hate me and want to injure me, that\u0027s why.\" \"Nonsense. You stole these things, it is useless for you to deny it.\" \"But I do deny it. I am no more a thief than you are—maybe not as much of a one,\" added Randy, significantly. At these words the purser turned pale for a moment. But he quickly recovered. \"I shall report this to the captain.\" \"I\u0027ll report too.\" \"I\u0027ll have you discharged.\" \"We\u0027ll see about that.\" Taking his things, Peter Polk went to the captain\u0027s office and told his story. Captain Hadley at once sent for Randy. \"This is a queer happening, Thompson,\" he said. \"Captain Hadley, I am not guilty,\" answered Randy. \"It is only another plot of Mr. Polk to get me into trouble.\" \"And you think he put the things there himself?\" \"I certainly do. I wish you would give me a day off,\" went on our hero, after an awkward pause. \"What for?\" \"I wish to see Mr. Shalley.\" \"He is in New York, on business.\" \"So much the better. I can call on him there, after we tie up.\" \"Do you want to take this matter to him?\" \"Not this alone. I have something else of importance. I know he will want to see me.\" \"Well, you can go. I hope you are not going to run away,\" and the captain smiled faintly. \"I have nothing to run away for, sir. Mr. Polk is down on me and I am going to do what I can to show him up, that is all. But please don\u0027t let him know that I am going to see Mr. Shalley.\" \"You have learned something important?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"About the purser?\" \"Yes, sir. But I can\u0027t speak of it just yet to you.\" \"Well, what about this clothing affair?\" \"Won\u0027t you let it rest for a few days?\" \"If you wish,\" answered Captain Hadley, and then he was called away to attend to some important duties. Although Randy did not know it, Peter Polk was nearby and caught a good bit of the talk between our hero and the captain. His face grew deathly pale when he learned that Randy was going to see Mr. Shalley and about his own personal doings. \"What has that cub discovered now?\" he asked himself. \"What can he tell about my doings?\" He was so worried he could not attend to his work. He turned the matter over in his mind and suddenly remembered the threatening letter he had received. He had paid the claim, but what had he done with the communication? He searched everywhere for it, but without avail. \"Fool that I was, that I did not tear it up and throw it overboard,\" he muttered to himself. \"If that boy has the letter it may lead to an investigation, and then——\" He did not finish but clenched his hands in rage and fear. He watched Randy narrowly, and after New York was reached saw our hero make preparations to go ashore. He did not know that Mr. Shalley was in the metropolis and could not comprehend Randy\u0027s move. \"Are you going ashore?\" he asked of our hero, when he got the chance. \"I am.\" \"Where are you going?\" \"Excuse me, Mr. Polk, but that is my private business.\" \"Did Captain Hadley say you could go?\" \"He did.\" \"Well, come to my office a minute, I want to talk to you,\" went on the purser, in a lower tone. \"Very well,\" answered Randy, and followed the man to the office, which at this time was deserted. \"Thompson, I want to know what you found in your locker besides my clothing,\" said the purser, after he had made certain that no outsiders were around. \"I found a cigar holder and a match safe.\" \"And what else?\" \"I must decline to answer that question.\" At this blunt refusal the brow of the purser darkened. \"You won\u0027t tell me?\" \"No.\" \"Did you find a—er—a letter?\" \"Perhaps I did.\" \"I want you to give it up.\" \"I didn\u0027t say I found it.\" \"But you did find it. It is my property and you must give it to me.\" To this Randy was silent. \"Do you hear me?\" \"I am not deaf, Mr. Polk.\" \"I know what you want to do!\" hissed the purser. \"You want to get me into trouble. But I\u0027ll not let you do it.\" \"Maybe you\u0027ll get yourself into trouble.\" \"Bah! I am not afraid of a boy, but——\" He paused and his manner changed. \"See here, Thompson, you are a poor boy, aren\u0027t you?\" \"I admit it.\" \"Well, some extra money will come in handy, won\u0027t it?\" \"What do you mean, Mr. Polk?\" \"I\u0027ll give you—er—five dollars for that letter.\" \"I haven\u0027t said that I had it yet.\" \"But I know you have it. Come, what do you say?\" \"I say, I am going about my business,\" answered Randy, and started for the doorway. \"Not yet!\" cried the purser, wrathfully, and flung him back into a corner. \"You\u0027ll settle with me first, even if I have to call a police officer!\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2998/82728.html","bookId":303,"book":{"id":303,"title":"Randy of the River The Adventures of a Young Deckhand","description":"简介： The majority of stories for boys have their background laid either in the city or the country, or possibly on the ocean, and we have read much about the doings of lads both rich and poor in such locations....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2998","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:31 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:31 AM"}}
