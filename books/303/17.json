{"id":27675,"no":17,"title":"CHAPTER XVI IN NEW YORK CITY","content":"\"Will he live, mamma?\" \"I think so, Rose. But he has been badly misused.\" \"Bill Hosker ought to be locked up for it.\" \"Nobody will lock Bill up. He has too much influence with the politicians,\" answered the woman. She was bending over Randy, who was still unconscious. Mother and daughter had carried our hero from the yard to their room in the rear of the tenement. Nobody else had been around. The girl had witnessed Bill Hosker\u0027s nefarious deed and had at once summoned her parent. Mrs. Clare was a poor widow lady who supported herself by sewing. Rose was her only child and did what she could to help her mother. Sewing did not pay well, and the Clares had all they could do to make both ends meet. But Mrs. Clare had a warm heart and so had Rose, and it pained them greatly to see Randy so mistreated. They carried him into their one room and placed him on their bed and did what they could for him. At last he opened his eyes and stared around him. Then he sat up slowly. \"Where am I?\" he asked, faintly. \"We brought you into the house—mother and I,\" answered Rose. \"Don\u0027t you remember, Bill Hosker struck you down?\" \"Oh, yes; I remember that now.\" Randy took a deep breath and put his hand to his head. \"He hit me pretty hard, didn\u0027t he?\" \"I am afraid he did,\" answered Mrs. Clare. \"It was a shame, too.\" \"Where is he now?\" \"He ran away.\" \"He stole eighty cents from me.\" \"Perhaps he took more,\" said Rose. \"He went through your pockets after he knocked you down. I saw him do it.\" With his head still aching, our hero felt in first one pocket and then another. He gave something like a groan. \"Every cent is gone!\" \"How much did you have?\" \"Between four and five dollars.\" \"I am sorry for you,\" said Mrs. Clare. \"But I am afraid you will never see your money again.\" \"Does that rascal live around here?\" \"Sometimes. He comes and goes to suit himself. I suppose he will stay away now for a while.\" \"Is there any use of my reporting this to the police, do you think?\" \"I don\u0027t think so. He once took my pocket-book from the table here—I am sure of it—but when I reported it to the police nothing was done. They said his word was as good as mine.\" \"How long have I been here?\" \"About half an hour.\" \"Then he has had a good chance to get away. Did you bring me here?\" \"Yes.\" \"You are very kind, Mrs. ——\" \"I am Mrs. Clare and this is my daughter Rose.\" \"And I am Randy Thompson, a deckhand on the Hudson River steamboat Helen Shalley.\" \"Oh!\" Mrs. Clare paused for a moment. \"Do you know Mr. Polk, the purser?\" \"Yes, but not very well. I just got the job as a deckhand to-day.\" \"Mr. Polk is a relative of mine by marriage.\" \"I see.\" \"We—that is—well, we are not very good friends,\" went on Mrs. Clare. \"Mamma thinks Mr. Polk hasn\u0027t been honest with us,\" put in Rose, quickly. \"I don\u0027t think so either.\" \"Rose, you must not talk so!\" \"But it is true, isn\u0027t it?\" returned the daughter. \"I may be misjudging Cousin Peter,\" said Mrs. Clare. \"You see,\" she added, by way of an explanation, \"my cousin Peter Polk had the settlement of my husband\u0027s affairs when he died, and I have always imagined that—well, that Rose and I did not get exactly what was coming to us.\" \"Mamma thought the account was three hundred dollars short,\" said Rose, who was inclined to be blunt. \"Couldn\u0027t you get a clear statement?\" questioned Randy, with interest. \"We got a statement, but it was not clear to me,\" answered Mrs. Clare. As soon as he felt able to do so, Randy got on his feet. He felt rather dizzy and he had a large lump over his left ear, where he had been struck by the club. \"See here,\" he said, when he was ready to depart, \"I am much obliged to you for what you have done. But I\u0027d like you to do more, if you will. As soon as this Bill Hosker comes back to this neighborhood let me know. You\u0027ll always find me on board of the Helen Shalley.\" \"I\u0027ll let you know,\" answered Rose. \"But don\u0027t let Bill Hosker know who told you, or he\u0027ll want to kill me.\" When Randy got back to the steamboat he felt so weak he could scarcely walk on board. Jones came forward to meet him. \"Say, you ain\u0027t been drinking, have you?\" he demanded, as he saw our hero stagger. \"No, I don\u0027t drink,\" answered Randy. \"I\u0027ve been knocked down and robbed.\" And sitting down on a bench he told his story to the other deckhand, and let Jones feel of the lump on his head. \"I was going to warn you when you went ashore, but I thought you\u0027d be wise enough to keep out of trouble. It\u0027s a shame.\" \"They told me it wouldn\u0027t do any good to tell the police.\" \"I am afraid not. Such things happen pretty often in that kind of a neighborhood.\" Randy was glad enough to turn in. He bathed the lump with cold water and put on some witch-hazel, which made it feel better. Despite the adventure he slept soundly until it was time to turn out in the morning. \"I suppose you\u0027ll want some money,\" said Jones. \"I can lend you a dollar till pay day, if you wish.\" \"Thank you,\" returned Randy. \"You are kind, and I\u0027ll accept the loan. I\u0027ll pay you back just as soon as I get my pay. I hate to be without a cent in my pocket.\" \"I have been there myself and know just how it feels,\" answered Jones. He had, in his rough way, taken a fancy to our hero, which feeling was reciprocated. There was plenty to do before the steamboat left the dock at New York City, and Randy\u0027s arms ached when the command came to cast off the lines. He had done his full share of the labor, and Pat Malloy nodded approvingly. \"Kape it up an\u0027 you\u0027ll be all roight,\" said the head deckhand. The trip to Albany that day had much of novelty in it for Randy. There was a good deal of work, of which he had not dreamed before, yet there were also times when he could look at the scenery as the big craft glided along. At the newsstand on board there was a big folding map of the river, showing the different towns and points of interest, and this the standkeeper loaned him for a couple of hours. He studied the map closely and was soon able to recognize certain points as they appeared. Several days slipped by and Randy felt quite at home on board. He had been supplied with the regulation deckhand\u0027s outfit; dark blue shirt and trousers, and a cap to match, and looked very well when thus attired. He was getting acquainted with the work and could handle a trunk, or a box or barrel almost as well as Jones or Malloy. \"How does the boy do?\" asked Captain Hadley of Malloy. \"It\u0027s the new broom as swapes clane,\" answered the head deckhand. \"I ain\u0027t braggin\u0027 yit, captain.\" \"But he is doing all right so far?\" \"Aye, aye, sur—very well indade.\" \"I am glad to hear it. Mr. Shalley told me the boy needed the job. His father is on the sick list, and he has got to do what he can to help support his parents.\" \"I reckon he\u0027ll be all right,\" answered Pat Malloy. \"He\u0027s better than thim foreigners, anyway.\" To him, the only foreigners were Italians and Germans. He did not think himself one, although he had come from the \"ould sod\" less than six years before. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2998/82716.html","bookId":303,"book":{"id":303,"title":"Randy of the River The Adventures of a Young Deckhand","description":"简介： The majority of stories for boys have their background laid either in the city or the country, or possibly on the ocean, and we have read much about the doings of lads both rich and poor in such locations....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2998","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:31 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:31 AM"}}
