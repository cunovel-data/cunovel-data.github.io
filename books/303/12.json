{"id":27670,"no":12,"title":"CHAPTER XI RANDY TO THE RESCUE","content":"The next day Randy went over to the Borden farm to finish up his work there. To his astonishment Sammy was on hand and apparently eager to go to work. \"Well, how was the celebration, Sammy?\" asked our hero. \"No good.\" \"That\u0027s too bad.\" \"After this I\u0027m a-goin\u0027 to stay to hum on the Fourth,\" went on Sammy, as he began to fork over the hay vigorously. \"I ain\u0027t goin\u0027 to no city to be skinned.\" \"Did they skin you?\" \"Jest about. A feller robbed me an\u0027 I was pushed into a duck pond.\" \"That\u0027s too bad.\" \"If I hadn\u0027t a-had my train ticket I\u0027d had to walk home,\" went on Sammy. \"As it was, I had to borrow fifteen cents on the stage, to pay fer thet ride. No more city celebrations fer me. I kin have all I want right here at Riverport.\" And then Sammy related his adventures in detail, to which our hero listened with much secret amusement. Over at the Thompson place the ground had been plowed up in part, and as soon as he left Jerry Borden Randy set to work in earnest to plant late vegetables. For what our hero had done for the Bordens he was paid in vegetables, and also received a rooster and four hens. This gave the Thompsons their own eggs, for which the lady of the cottage was thankful. Randy was at work early one morning, when Jack appeared. \"Hullo, at it already?\" sang out Jack. \"I thought I\u0027d find you still in bed.\" \"I prefer to work when the sun is not so hot,\" answered Randy. \"But what brings you out at such an hour as this?\" \"I\u0027ve got news.\" \"What is it?\" \"We are going to move to Albany.\" \"When?\" \"The first of next week.\" \"I\u0027ll be sorry to miss you, Jack.\" \"And I\u0027ll be sorry to leave you, Randy. But I came over for something more than to tell the news. I want you to go fishing with me. They say the sport is extra fine just now.\" \"I don\u0027t know if I can go,\" answered our hero, doubtfully. \"There is still enough to do here.\" \"It will be a change for you. You have worked very hard lately.\" \"I admit that.\" \"Go by all means, if you care to, Randy,\" called out Mrs. Thompson. \"You have earned a holiday, and the fish will be acceptable.\" \"All right, mother; if you say so, I\u0027ll go.\" It did not take Randy long to prepare for the outing. Jack had with him a basket of lunch for two, so all he had to get was his line and hooks and some extra bait. \"I hope we catch a good mess to-day,\" said Randy, as they started off. \"Then I can give Mr. Borden some and he can let us have some bacon that we need.\" \"I suppose it is rather hard scratching for you just now,\" said Jack. \"It is, and I am going to look for outside work before long.\" \"Well, I hope you find something to do. Ben Bash was looking for work all over this district but he couldn\u0027t find a thing.\" \"Oh, I know there is small chance in Riverport. I think I may try elsewhere,\" answered our hero. It did not take the two boys long to reach the river, at a point where Jack had left his boat. Both rowed to their favorite fishing spot. \"Oh, isn\u0027t that too bad!\" cried Jack, in disappointment. Strangers were fishing at the spot and they soon saw that there was no room for them to throw in. \"How is fishing?\" called out Randy. \"Very good,\" answered one of those present. \"We\u0027ll have to go elsewhere,\" said Jack. \"The question is, where?\" \"I know another spot about quarter of a mile from here,\" answered Randy. \"It may be just as good.\" They rowed on and reached the new place, to find nobody there. Soon they had their boat tied fast to an overhanging tree and then they got out on some flat rocks and baited up. It did not take long to prove that the new fishing place was as good as the old. Randy drew in a small fish almost immediately and Jack did the same. Then both got hauls of good size. \"Maybe we\u0027ll do better than if we went to the old Fishing Hole,\" observed Jack. At noon time they knocked off for lunch and a rest and then took a good swim. \"I can tell you, I enjoy this!\" cried Randy. \"I haven\u0027t had a chance to go in for so long.\" The swim at an end, the boys donned their garments and resumed their fishing. They kept at it until about four o\u0027clock. Then all their luck seemed to suddenly desert them. \"Never mind,\" said Randy. \"We certainly have a prime haul, even as it is,\" and he looked the fish over with much pride. They wound up their lines and were soon on the way down the river. It was rather a hot day, so they took their time in getting back. \"What are you going to do with your boat?\" asked Randy. \"Sell it to Mr. Stanwood for ten dollars.\" \"You are lucky to get a customer, Jack.\" \"I know it. I\u0027d turn the boat over to you only—well—we need the money now, you know,\" and Jack\u0027s eyes dropped. \"Thank you, Jack, but I wouldn\u0027t have much time to use it. I must put in the most of my time at work.\" \"I suppose that is true. At the same time I\u0027d rather you had the boat than anybody I know of.\" The boys were coming around a bend of the river when they heard a peculiar noise in the distance. \"What do you make that out to be?\" asked Jack, as the noise continued. \"I think I know,\" answered our hero. \"It is the new tugboat from the bay. I saw it once, several weeks ago. It makes a very odd sound, for the engine is not like the ordinary ones.\" The noise kept coming closer and presently the tugboat came into view. It was stuck in the mud and those on board were doing what they could to get the craft afloat again. \"They seem to be having a hard time of it,\" remarked Jack, as he stopped rowing to watch the proceedings. \"The mud is very sticky here, if you\u0027ll remember,\" answered Randy. \"Don\u0027t you remember how we were stuck here last year?\" \"Yes, and how I lost an oar overboard and nearly went overboard myself,\" continued Jack, with a short laugh. \"Heigh-ho! Randy, I\u0027ll be sorry in a way to lose it all.\" \"We must write to each other.\" \"Of course.\" The tug was puffing and snorting viciously to get out of the mud. On board were four people who were evidently passengers, including a lady with a little girl. Suddenly there came something which sounded like an explosion. This was followed by a cloud of steam that seemed to completely envelop the tugboat. \"Something is wrong!\" shouted Randy. \"Oh, mamma, I don\u0027t like this!\" screamed the little girl, as she ran to the stern of the tug. \"We\u0027ll be burned up!\" She had scarcely spoken when there came another explosion and the cloud of steam increased. The four passengers crowded to the stern in a body, and a moment later the two men leaped overboard and called on the lady and her child to do likewise. \"I cannot swim!\" shrieked the lady. \"You must jump!\" answered somebody. \"The tug may blow up!\" The little girl heard this and with a scream she ran from her mother straight for the bow of the tug. The next moment she lost her balance and went overboard. \"She\u0027s over!\" cried Randy, and his heart leaped into his throat. \"Save my child! Save Helen!\" shrieked the lady and rushed after her offspring. Soon she was in the water also. The situation was certainly a thrilling one. The two men in the water were fifty feet away and those left on the tug were in no position to render assistance. The child had disappeared completely, while the mother was thrashing around wildly, in water just up to her neck. \"Quick, Jack, turn the boat around!\" ejaculated Randy. \"We must get them on board.\" The craft was turned around and headed for the lady. Then Randy threw off his cap—he was already in his shirt sleeves—and stood up in the bow. He gazed anxiously into the muddy water and caught a dim view of the little girl\u0027s white dress. \"My child! My child!\" the mother continued to scream. A little girl drowning in the water. \"I\u0027ll bring her up,\" said Randy, and made a leap overboard, just as the gunwale of the rowboat came within reaching distance of the lady\u0027s hands. The little girl had been caught by the current and was being carried down the stream. Randy made a quick grab but missed her, and then she disappeared from view. But in a few seconds more he saw her again, and this time secured hold of her arm. The next moment he raised her to the surface of the river. She was too far gone to do anything but splutter. She clutched him with a deathlike grip—a thing every person in danger of drowning will do—and he had his hands full to keep both himself and his burden afloat. Shallow water was not far off and he struck out for this and waded ashore. In the meantime Jack was having no easy time of it getting the lady into the rowboat. There was serious danger of the craft overturning, and he had to caution her to be careful. \"My child! My Helen!\" she moaned, when she was at last safe. \"My friend will save her,\" answered Jack. \"You are sure?\" \"Yes.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2998/82711.html","bookId":303,"book":{"id":303,"title":"Randy of the River The Adventures of a Young Deckhand","description":"简介： The majority of stories for boys have their background laid either in the city or the country, or possibly on the ocean, and we have read much about the doings of lads both rich and poor in such locations....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2998","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:31 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:31 AM"}}
