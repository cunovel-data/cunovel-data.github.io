{"id":27663,"no":5,"title":"CHAPTER IV RANDY AT HOME","content":"All unmindful of the trouble that had already come to the Bartletts, and of the trouble Bob Bangs was hatching out for him, Randy divided the mess of fish with Jack and hurried home. \"See what a fine mess I\u0027ve got, mother!\" he cried, as he entered the kitchen, where his mother had just started to prepare the evening meal. \"Aren\u0027t they real beauties?\" \"They are, Randy,\" answered Mrs. Thompson, and smiled brightly. \"Did Jack do as well?\" \"Almost as well as I did, and we divided evenly, because, you see, he furnished the boat. And, mother, I\u0027ve found out where we can get a fine lot of blackberries. If you want me to, I\u0027ll go for them to-morrow.\" \"I wish you would, Randy. Your father loves blackberry pie and blackberry pudding.\" \"And so do I.\" \"I\u0027ve got time to fry some of these fish for supper,\" went on Mrs. Thompson. \"And we can have some more to-morrow, too. But I don\u0027t think we can use them all.\" \"I was thinking we might give Mrs. Gilligan a couple.\" \"That will be very nice. If you will, take them over at once.\" Mrs. Gilligan was a poor Irishwoman who took in washing and ironing for a living. She was alone in the world and often had a struggle to make both ends meet. \"Just to look at that now!\" she cried, as Randy held up the fish. \"Sure an\u0027 ye air a great fisher b\u0027y, Randy, so ye air!\" \"I got so many I thought I\u0027d bring you a couple,\" said our hero. \"Now that\u0027s rale kind of ye,\" answered Mrs. Gilligan, as she dried her hands and took the fish. \"Just loike my Pat used to catch afore he was kilt on the railroad.\" \"I caught them this afternoon, so you can be sure they are fresh.\" \"I\u0027m much obliged to ye, I am indade,\" said Mrs. Gilligan. She drew a long breath. \"Sure an\u0027 the Lord is good to us after all. I was just afther thinkin\u0027 I had nothin\u0027 but throuble, whin in comes these iligant fish.\" \"Is something wrong?\" asked Randy, curiously. \"It\u0027s not a great dale, yet it\u0027s enough fer a poor woman loike me. It\u0027s Mrs. Bangs\u0027 wash, so it is. Nothin\u0027 suits that lady, an\u0027 she always wants to pay less than she agreed.\" \"You mean Bob Bangs\u0027 mother?\" \"Th\u0027 same, Randy. Oh, they are a hard-hearted family, so they are!\" \"I believe you. And yet Mr. Bangs is rich.\" \"It\u0027s little enough I see of his money,\" sighed Mrs. Gilligan. \"Although I do me besht wid the washin\u0027 an\u0027 ironin\u0027, so I do!\" \"It\u0027s a wonder Mrs. Bangs don\u0027t make the servant do the washing and ironing.\" \"She did make the other wan do that same. But the new one can\u0027t iron an\u0027 won\u0027t try, so I have the work, an\u0027 the girrul gits less wages,\" answered the Irishwoman. When Randy returned home he found supper almost ready. The appetizing odor of frying fish filled the air. A few minutes later Mr. Thompson came in. Louis Thompson was a man a little past middle age, tall and thin and not unlike Randy in the general appearance of his face. He was not a strong man, and the winter before had been laid up with a severe attack of rheumatism. \"That smells good,\" he said, with a smile, as he kissed his wife. \"I like fish.\" \"Randy just caught them.\" \"Good enough.\" \"You look tired, Louis,\" went on Mrs. Thompson. \"Was the work extra hard?\" \"Not much harder than usual, Lucy, but I was working on a cellar partition and it was very damp. It brought back a bit of the rheumatism.\" \"That is too bad.\" \"Can\u0027t the boss give you something else to do—something where it isn\u0027t damp?\" questioned Randy. \"I have asked him about it,\" answered his father. \"But just at present there is nothing else in sight.\" \"You must take care, Louis,\" said Mrs. Thompson. \"It will not do to risk having the rheumatism come back.\" \"I wish I could get something to do,\" said Randy, while the evening meal was in progress. \"I might earn some money and it would help. But there doesn\u0027t seem to be any kind of an opening in Riverport.\" \"Times are rather dull,\" answered Mr. Thompson. \"And I am afraid they will be worse before they are better.\" On the following day Randy went out after blackberries. Jack went with him and the boys went up the stream in the latter\u0027s boat. \"If I can get a good mess mother is going to preserve some,\" said Randy. \"I like blackberry jam,\" answered his friend. The two boys had brought their lunch with them, intending to remain out all day. By noon they had picked twelve quarts of berries and then sat down by the river side to eat their lunch. \"What do you say to a swim?\" remarked Jack, after the meal was over. \"Just the thing!\" cried our hero. \"But we mustn\u0027t remain in longer than half an hour. I want to pick more berries.\" They were soon in the water, which was deliciously cool and refreshing. They dove and splashed around to their hearts\u0027 content and raced from one bank to the other and back. Randy won the race by several seconds. \"I declare, Randy, you are a regular water rat!\" declared Jack. \"I never saw a better swimmer.\" \"Well, I do love the water, that is certain,\" answered Randy. \"And you row such a good stroke, too.\" \"That\u0027s because I love boats.\" The half-hour at an end, our hero leaped ashore and began to don his garments, and Jack did the same. They were just finishing their toilet when a rowboat came into view, containing Bob Bangs and several other of the loud boys of Riverport. \"There is Bob Bangs again,\" whispered Randy. \"We\u0027ll have to watch out that he doesn\u0027t try to rob us of our berries,\" whispered Jack, significantly. \"Humph! Up here again, eh?\" remarked the big youth, resting on his oars. \"We are,\" answered Randy. \"I think we can come, if we please.\" \"Certainly—for all I care,\" growled Bob. \"We are picking berries, and we intend to watch them, too,\" put in Randy, loudly. At this pointed remark Bob Bangs colored slightly. \"I should think you\u0027d pick your company, Jack Bartlett,\" he said, coarsely. \"I do. That is why I am not with you.\" \"Humph!\" \"I consider myself just as good as you, Bob Bangs,\" said Randy, warmly. \"I may not be as rich, but I never tried to steal a mess of fish from anybody.\" \"You shut up!\" roared the big boy. And then he started to row away. \"You\u0027ll not get a chance to rob us of these berries,\" called out Jack after him. \"What do they mean about robbing somebody of fish?\" asked one of Bob\u0027s companions. \"Oh, that was only a joke,\" answered the rich youth. \"Just wait—I\u0027ll fix them for it!\" As soon as Bangs and his cronies had disappeared Randy and Jack went back to their berry picking. They worked steadily until five o\u0027clock in the afternoon, and by that time had a great number of quarts to their credit. \"The folks at home will be pleased,\" said Jack. \"My mother loves fresh berries. She says they are much better than those which are several days in the market.\" \"And she is right.\" The boys had brought along several large and small kettles, and had left three of these down near the boat, filled with the fruit. Each walked to the shore with a kettle full of berries in his hand. \"Well, I never!\" cried Jack, in dismay. \"Bob Bangs again!\" murmured Randy. \"Oh, don\u0027t I just wish I had him here. I\u0027d pummel him good!\" There was good cause for our hero\u0027s anger. On the rocks lay the overturned berry kettles, the berries scattered in all directions and many of them crushed under foot. \"And look at the boat!\" gasped Jack, turning to inspect the craft. The rowboat was partly filled with water and on the seats and in the bottom a quantity of mud had been thrown. The oars were sticking in a mud bank close by. \"Does she leak?\" asked our hero, with concern. \"I\u0027ll have to find out.\" It was soon discovered that the craft was intact, and then they set to work to clean up the muss. This was no easy job, and the boys perspired freely, for the day was a warm one. Then Randy looked over the scattered berries. \"About one-third of them are fit to take along,\" he said. \"The others are crushed and dirty.\" \"I\u0027ll tell you what I am going to do,\" said Jack, stoutly. \"I am going to make Bob Bangs pay for dirtying my boat, and he can pay for the lost berries, too.\" \"But how can we prove he is guilty?\" \"We\u0027ll make him own up to it. Nobody else would play such a mean trick.\" The two boys were in no happy frame of mind as they rowed back to Riverport. They suspected that Bob Bangs would keep out of their sight, but just as they were landing they caught sight of him peering at them from behind a dock building. \"There he is!\" cried Jack. \"After him, Randy!\" \"Right you are!\" answered our hero, and ran after Bob Bangs with might and main. Randy was a good sprinter and although the rich youth tried to get away he was soon brought to a halt. \"Let go of me!\" he roared, as Randy caught him by the collar. \"Not just yet, Bob Bangs!\" returned Randy. \"A fine trick you played this afternoon.\" \"I didn\u0027t play any trick!\" \"Yes, you did.\" \"I didn\u0027t! Let me go!\" And now Bob Bangs did his best to get away. He saw that Randy and Jack were thoroughly angry and was afraid he was in for a drubbing—or worse. He gave a jerk and then started to run. Randy put out his foot and the big youth went sprawling full length, his face violently striking the ground. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2998/82704.html","bookId":303,"book":{"id":303,"title":"Randy of the River The Adventures of a Young Deckhand","description":"简介： The majority of stories for boys have their background laid either in the city or the country, or possibly on the ocean, and we have read much about the doings of lads both rich and poor in such locations....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2998","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:31 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:31 AM"}}
