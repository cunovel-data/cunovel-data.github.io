{"id":27668,"no":10,"title":"CHAPTER IX THE NEW HOME","content":"The next few days were busy ones for Mrs. Thompson and for Randy. The landlord of the cottage in which they lived was notified that they were going to move, and then the woman set to work to get ready to vacate, while Randy went over to the other place to put the house in condition for occupancy. While Randy was at work Jack came to see him, and insisted upon lending a helping hand. Randy had brought over some of his father\u0027s tools and also some nails, and he purchased at the lumber yard a few boards and other pieces he thought he needed. When he once got at it, it was astonishing how well our hero used the tools, making several repairs that would have done credit to a regular carpenter. The broken window was replaced, and the missing door found and rehung, and several clapboards nailed fast. Then Randy mended the porch, and put a score of shingles on the roof. This done, the chimney was cleaned out and also the cistern, and the well was also overhauled. In the meantime Jack pulled out a lot of weeds and trained a wild honeysuckle over the porch. At the end of four days the place looked quite well. \"It\u0027s a hundred per cent. better than it was,\" declared Jack. \"It didn\u0027t look like anything before.\" \"I\u0027ll get a can of paint to-morrow and paint the door and the window frames,\" said Randy, and this was done. He also whitewashed the kitchen, and kalsomined the other rooms, so that the interior of the cottage was sweet and clean. When Mrs. Thompson saw the change which had been wrought she was delighted. \"I declare, it looks as well, if not better, than the cottage we are in,\" she cried. \"And the outlook toward the river is ever so much nicer.\" \"Just wait until I have the garden in shape,\" said Randy. \"You won\u0027t know the spot.\" \"What a pity we did not know of this place before.\" \"Mother, I think we ought to buy it if we can.\" \"Perhaps we shall, Randy, before the five years are up.\" At length came the day to move. A local truckman who knew Mr. Thompson well moved them for nothing. \"You can do some odd jobs for me some time,\" said the truckman to Louis Thompson. \"Thank you, I will—when I am able,\" answered the sufferer. A good deal of the pain had left Mr. Thompson, but he was weak, and to start to regular work was out of the question. Another friend took him to his new cottage in a carriage. He gazed at the old place in wonder. \"Well, it certainly is improved!\" he ejaculated. \"We shall get along here very well.\" The moving was done early in the morning and by nightfall Randy and his mother had the cottage in tolerable order. The stove was set up and found to draw good, and the water from the well tasted fine. \"Now there is one thing certain,\" said Randy, \"Mother, come what may, we shall have a roof over our heads.\" \"Yes, my son, and I am grateful for it,\" answered Mrs. Thompson. \"Uncle Peter may be a hard man to get along with, but he has certainly helped us.\" The next two weeks were busy ones for Randy. Jerry Borden was true to his promise and not only did some plowing for the Thompsons but also helped Randy to put up a new fence, partly of stone and partly of rails. It was agreed that Borden should have the use of part of the little farm for pasturing, and in return was to give the Thompsons two quarts of milk a day and two pounds of butter per week, and also a dozen fresh eggs a week while the hens were laying. \"That will certainly help us out wonderfully,\" said Mrs. Thompson. \"Butter, eggs, and milk are quite an item of expense.\" \"And that is not all,\" said Randy. \"I am going to help Mr. Borden with his haying soon and he is going to pay us in early vegetables.\" The haying time was already at hand, and Randy soon pitched in with a will, much to his neighbor\u0027s satisfaction. One day Jack came to bring good news. His father had secured a position with an iron works at Albany, on the Hudson River. \"It will pay him a fair salary,\" said Jack. \"I am glad to hear it,\" answered Randy. \"What will your family do, remain here or move to Albany?\" \"We are going to remain here for the present, but, if the place suits father after he has been there a while, then we\u0027ll move.\" \"Have you learned anything more about the Bangses?\" \"Mrs. Bangs and Bob are on a summer vacation.\" \"Yes, I know that. I meant Mr. Bangs.\" \"He is in full charge at the iron works here and drawing a salary of eight thousand dollars a year. Father says he will run the works into the ground so that the stock won\u0027t be worth a cent.\" \"Can\u0027t your father do anything?\" \"Not yet. But he is going to watch things. There was some trouble over a contract and he is trying to get to the bottom of that,\" continued Jack. When Randy went to work for Farmer Borden he came into contact with the farmer\u0027s son Sammy, a tall, overgrown lad of fourteen, with a freckled face and a shock of red hair. Sammy hated to work, and his father and mother had to fairly drive him to get anything out of him. \"City folks don\u0027t work like farmers,\" remarked Sammy to Randy. \"They jest lay off an\u0027 take it easy.\" \"How do you know that?\" asked our hero, in quiet amusement. \"\u0027Cos I once read a paper of the sports in the city.\" \"Some rich folks don\u0027t work, Sammy. But all the others work as hard as we do.\" \"I don\u0027t believe it,\" said Sammy, stoutly. \"Wish I was a city lad. Oh, wouldn\u0027t I jest have the bang-up time, though!\" \"Sammy Borden!\" cried his mother, shrilly. \"You get to work, an\u0027 be quick about it.\" \"I\u0027m tired,\" answered the freckled-faced lad. \"Tired? Lazy, you mean! Git to work, or I\u0027ll have your paw give you a dressin\u0027 down!\" \"Drat the luck!\" muttered Sammy, as he took up his pitchfork. \"I wish I was born in the city!\" \"Come on, Sammy,\" said Randy. \"The work has got to be done, so don\u0027t think about it, but do it.\" \"Huh! Work is easy to you, Randy Thompson! But it comes hard on me!\" And Sammy heaved a ponderous sigh. The haying was in full blast early in July and Randy worked early and late. He wanted to get through, so that he might go at his own garden. Sammy dragged worse than ever, and finally confided to our hero that he wanted to go to the city over the Fourth. \"Have you asked your folks yet?\" asked Randy. \"No, but I\u0027m a-goin\u0027 to,\" answered Sammy. \"Well, if you go, I hope you have a good time,\" said our hero. \"I\u0027d like to see a Fourth of July in the city myself. I\u0027ve heard they make a good deal of noise, but I shouldn\u0027t mind that.\" \"Gosh! I love shootin\u0027,\" said Sammy. \"Aren\u0027t you afraid you might get lost?\" pursued Randy. \"Lost!\" snorted Sammy. \"Not much! Why, you can\u0027t lose me in the woods, much less in the city.\" \"The city and the woods are two different places.\" \"I don\u0027t care. I\u0027d know what I was doin\u0027.\" \"It costs money to go to the city.\" \"I want to go to Springfield.\" \"Have you any money saved up?\" To this Sammy did not answer. Then Mr. Borden came along. \"Sammy, get to work!\" he called out. \"Don\u0027t let Randy do everything.\" \"I was workin\u0027,\" grumbled the son, as he started in again. \"You can\u0027t expect a feller like me to pitch hay all day long.\" \"I have to work all day,\" retorted his father. \"It ain\u0027t fair nohow.\" \"If you want to eat you\u0027ll have to work.\" Sammy pitched in, but grumbled a good deal to himself. Soon his mother called him and he went off to the house. \"That lad is gettin\u0027 lazier every day,\" said Jerry Borden. \"I declare, I don\u0027t know what to do with him.\" \"Maybe he needs a vacation,\" suggested our hero. \"Well, he can\u0027t have one until the hayin\u0027 is done,\" declared the farmer. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2998/82709.html","bookId":303,"book":{"id":303,"title":"Randy of the River The Adventures of a Young Deckhand","description":"简介： The majority of stories for boys have their background laid either in the city or the country, or possibly on the ocean, and we have read much about the doings of lads both rich and poor in such locations....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2998","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:31 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:31 AM"}}
