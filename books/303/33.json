{"id":27691,"no":33,"title":"CHAPTER XXXI NEWS OF IMPORTANCE","content":"As was natural, our hero drifted down to the long steamboat landing. While he was standing around, he saw a ferryboat coming across the river, filled with passengers from the railroad station on the opposite shore. As the passengers alighted he recognized Amos Bangs in the crowd. The rich manufacturer looked around anxiously, and presently caught sight of Mrs. Bangs, who had come to meet him in a carriage. Randy slipped out of sight. \"Well?\" demanded Amos Bangs, as soon as he and his wife were together. \"Oh, Amos!\" the woman cried, and could not go on. \"Is that all you can say, Viola?\" demanded the husband, harshly. \"I can do nothing with the girl.\" \"And she knows where the papers are?\" \"She does.\" \"How did it happen?\" \"When Mr. Tuller called upon me she played the eavesdropper. She saw us open the safe and take out the papers, and when I went and hid the papers she followed me.\" \"But you said you were sure nobody knew where the papers were.\" \"I thought so at the time, but I was mistaken.\" \"How did it come out?\" \"The girl did not sweep and dust the parlor to suit me, and I took her to task about it. She threw down her broom and said she would take no words from me. Then I told her to pack her trunk and leave the house. She grew more impertinent than ever, and said she would go, but I would have to pay her her wages regularly anyway. I asked what she meant. Then she told me to go and look for the papers I had hidden.\" \"And they were gone?\" \"Yes. I was so overcome I nearly fainted,\" and Mrs. Bangs\u0027s face showed her deep concern. \"What next?\" \"I went back to the girl and told her she must give the papers up or I would have her arrested. She laughed in my face. Oh, Amos, think of that horrid creature doing that!\" \"She knew she had you,\" growled the rich manufacturer. \"What did you do then?\" \"Why—I—broke down, I couldn\u0027t help it. I asked her what she wanted for the papers. She wouldn\u0027t tell, and I said I would give her five dollars. Then she laughed in my face again. I wanted to drive her from the house, but I didn\u0027t dare.\" \"Did she say what she was going to do?\" \"At last she said she would make a bargain—think of it—a bargain with a servant girl! She wants me to pay her wages regularly and also twelve dollars a month for her board.\" \"Will she work for you?\" \"No, indeed, she says she will go and live with her married sister.\" \"Humph! Let me see, her name is Jackson, isn\u0027t it?\" \"Yes, Mamie Jackson. Her sister lives over in Oakdale.\" \"Did she go to Oakdale?\" \"I suppose she did.\" \"She must have the papers with her.\" \"No, I think she hid them, for she said we wouldn\u0027t find the papers even if we searched her and her trunk.\" \"I will have to go to Oakdale and see her,\" said Amos Bangs, after a pause in which he rubbed his chin reflectively. The rich manufacturer and his wife had withdrawn to a corner of the dock while talking. Randy had kept nearby, behind some boxes and barrels, and had heard every word that was spoken. That he was immensely interested goes without saying. \"On the track of Mr. Bartlett\u0027s papers at last,\" he told himself. \"Now, what had I best do about it?\" His one thought was to outwit Amos Bangs, and with this in mind he left the dock and walked rapidly toward the telegraph office. \"I wish to send another telegram,\" said he as he drew the pad of forms toward him. \"Must be your night for sending messages,\" answered the clerk, by way of a joke. \"I want this rushed through—it is highly important.\" \"All right, hand it over.\" Randy hardly knew what to say, but soon wrote down the following, addressed to Mr. Bartlett: \"Papers taken from Mrs. Bangs by Mamie Jackson, a servant, now at sister\u0027s in Oakdale. Hurry if you want to get them. Address me at Catskill.\" Having sent the message, there seemed nothing for Randy to do but to retire. This he did, and was awakened two hours later by a message from Mr. Bartlett, which was in these words: \"Coming down first morning train. Meet me at Catskill Station, Hudson River Railroad.\" Having received this message Randy consulted a time table and found that the first Albany train would arrive at the station across the river at about seven o\u0027clock. He arranged to be on hand, and then tried to go to sleep again. But the most he could do was to take a few fitful naps. As soon as the train rolled in Philip Bartlett alighted. Randy rushed towards him. \"Are you going to Oakdale?\" he asked, quickly. \"Do you think it worth while, Randy?\" \"I do.\" \"Then I will go. You must come along.\" \"I will,\" answered our hero, and then Mr. Bartlett got back on the train and Randy followed him. \"I left word with Mr. Ball, so Captain Hadley won\u0027t worry about me,\" Randy explained when seated. \"Now tell me what this means?\" asked Philip Bartlett, impatiently. \"I have been on the anxious seat ever since I received your telegram.\" \"I want you to get in ahead of Mr. Bangs,\" said our hero, and then told all he had overheard. \"I will make that servant girl give me those papers,\" said Mr. Bartlett, with decision. \"Perhaps you can scare her just as Mr. Shalley scared a fellow who was aiding another man to rob him,\" answered our hero. \"I will tell you about that another time. I am pledged not to say anything just at present.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2998/82732.html","bookId":303,"book":{"id":303,"title":"Randy of the River The Adventures of a Young Deckhand","description":"简介： The majority of stories for boys have their background laid either in the city or the country, or possibly on the ocean, and we have read much about the doings of lads both rich and poor in such locations....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2998","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:31 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:31 AM"}}
