only to the family of the tribe of their father shall they marry. \n [bbe] This is the order of the Lord about the daughters of Zelophehad: The Lord says, Let them take as their husbands whoever is most pleasing to them, but only among the family of their father\u0027s tribe. \n 36:7 [hgb] 这 样 ， 以 色 列 人 的 产 业 就 不 从 这 支 派 归 到 那 支 派 ， 因 为 以 色 列 人 要 各 守 各 祖 宗 支 派 的 产 业 。 \n [kjv] So shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe: for every one of the children of Israel shall keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers. \n [bbe] And so no property will be handed from tribe to tribe among the children of Israel; but every one of the children of Israel will keep the heritage of his father\u0027s tribe. \n 36:8 [hgb] 凡 在 以 色 列 支 派 中 得 了 产 业 的 女 子 必 作 同 宗 支 派 人 的 妻 ， 好 叫 以 色 列 人 各 自 承 受 他 祖 宗 的 产 业 。 \n [kjv] And every daughter, that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel, shall be wife unto one of the family of the tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may enjoy every man the inheritance of his fathers. \n [bbe] And every daughter owning property in any tribe of the children of Israel is to be married to one of the family of her father\u0027s tribe, so that every man of the children of Israel may keep the heritage of his fathers. \n 36:9 [hgb] 这 样 ， 他 们 的 产 业 就 不 从 这 支 派 归 到 那 支 派 ， 因 为 以 色 列 支 派 的 人 要 各 守 各 的 产 业 。 \n [kjv] Neither shall the inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe; but every one of the tribes of the children of Israel shall keep himself to his own inheritance. \n [bbe] And no property will be handed from one tribe to another, but every tribe of the children of Israel will keep its heritage. \n 36:10 [hgb] 耶 和 华 怎 样 吩 咐 摩 西 ， 西 罗 非 哈 的 众 女 儿 就 怎 样 行 。 \n [kjv] Even as the LORD commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad: \n [bbe] So the daughters of Zelophehad did as the Lord gave orders to Moses: \n 36:11 [hgb] 西 罗 非 哈 的 女 儿 玛 拉 ， 得 撒 ， 曷 拉 ， 密 迦 ， 挪 阿 都 嫁 了 他 们 伯 叔 的 儿 子 。 \n [kjv] For Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married unto their father\u0027s brothers\u0027 sons: \n [bbe] For Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, took as their husbands the sons of their father\u0027s brothers: \n 36:12 [hgb] 她 们 嫁 入 约 瑟 儿 子 ， 玛 拿 西 子 孙 的 族 中 。 她 们 的 产 业 仍 留 在 同 宗 支 派 中 。 \n [kjv] And they were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father. \n [bbe] And were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh, the son of Joseph, and their property was kept in the tribe of their father\u0027s family \n 36:13 [hgb] 这 是 耶 和 华 在 摩 押 平 原 约 旦 河 边 ， 耶 利 哥 对 面 借 着 摩 西 所 吩 咐 以 色 列 人 的 命 令 典 章 。 \n [kjv] These are the commandments and the judgments, which the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses unto the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho. \n [bbe] These are the laws and the orders which the Lord gave to the children of Israel by Moses, in the lowlands of Moab by Jordan at Jericho. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/20/489.html","bookId":240,"book":{"id":240,"title":"Numbers民数记（双语小说）","description":"简介： And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the tabernacle of the congregation, on the first day of the second month, in the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying； Take ye the sum of all the ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/20","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:53 AM"}}
