{"id":7324,"no":8,"title":"Chapter 8","content":"8:1 [hgb] 耶 和 华 晓 谕 摩 西 说 ， [kjv] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, [bbe] And the Lord said to Moses, 8:2 [hgb] 你 告 诉 亚 伦 说 ， 点 灯 的 时 候 ， 七 盏 灯 都 要 向 灯 台 前 面 发 光 。 [kjv] Speak unto Aaron, and say unto him, When thou lightest the lamps, the seven lamps shall give light over against the candlestick. [bbe] Say to Aaron, When you put the lights in their places, the seven lights will give light in front of the support. 8:3 [hgb] 亚 伦 便 这 样 行 。 他 点 灯 台 上 的 灯 ， 使 灯 向 前 发 光 ， 是 照 耶 和 华 所 吩 咐 摩 西 的 。 [kjv] And Aaron did so; he lighted the lamps thereof over against the candlestick, as the LORD commanded Moses. [bbe] And Aaron did so; he put the lights in their places so that they gave light in front of the support, as the Lord gave orders to Moses. 8:4 [hgb] 这 灯 台 的 作 法 是 用 金 子 锤 出 来 的 ， 连 座 带 花 都 是 锤 出 来 的 。 摩 西 制 造 灯 台 ， 是 照 耶 和 华 所 指 示 的 样 式 。 [kjv] And this work of the candlestick was of beaten gold, unto the shaft thereof, unto the flowers thereof, was beaten work: according unto the pattern which the LORD had shewed Moses, so he made the candlestick. [bbe] The support for the lights was of hammered gold work, from its base to its flowers it was of hammered work; from the design which the Lord had given to Moses, he made the support for the lights. 8:5 [hgb] 耶 和 华 晓 谕 摩 西 说 ， [kjv] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, [bbe] And the Lord said to Moses, 8:6 [hgb] 你 从 以 色 列 人 中 选 出 利 未 人 来 ， 洁 净 他 们 。 [kjv] Take the Levites from among the children of Israel, and cleanse them. [bbe] Take the Levites out from among the children of Israel and make them clean. 8:7 [hgb] 洁 净 他 们 当 这 样 行 ， 用 除 罪 水 弹 在 他 们 身 上 ， 又 叫 他 们 用 剃 头 刀 刮 全 身 ， 洗 衣 服 ， 洁 净 自 己 。 [kjv] And thus shalt thou do unto them, to cleanse them: Sprinkle water of purifying upon them, and let them shave all their flesh, and let them wash their clothes, and so make themselves clean. [bbe] And this is how you are to make them clean: let the holy water which takes away sin be put on them, and let the hair all over their bodies be cut off with a sharp blade, and let their clothing be washed and their bodies made clean. 8:8 [hgb] 然 后 叫 他 们 取 一 只 公 牛 犊 ， 并 同 献 的 素 祭 ， 就 是 调 油 的 细 面 。 你 要 另 取 一 只 公 牛 犊 作 赎 罪 祭 。 [kjv] Then let them take a young bullock with his meat offering, even fine flour mingled with oil, and another young bullock shalt thou take for a sin offering. [bbe] Then let them take a young ox and its meal offering, crushed grain mixed with oil, and take another ox for a sin-offering. 8:9 [hgb] 将 利 未 人 奉 到 会 幕 前 ， 招 聚 以 色 列 全 会 众 。 [kjv] And thou shalt bring the Levites before the tabernacle of the congregation: and thou shalt gather the whole assembly of the children of Israel together: [bbe] And make the Levites come forward in front of the Tent of meeting, and let all the children of Israel come together: 8:10 [hgb] 将 利 未 人 奉 到 耶 和 华 面 前 ， 以 色 列 人 要 按 手 在 他 们 头 上 。 [kjv] And thou shalt bring the Levites before the LORD: and the children of Israel shall put their hands upon the Levites: [bbe] And you are to take the Levites before the Lord: and the children of Israel are to put their hands on them: 8:11 [hgb] 亚 伦 也 将 他 们 奉 到 耶 和 华 面 前 ， 为 以 色 列 人 当 作 摇 祭 ， 使 他 们 好 办 耶 和 华 的 事 。 [kjv] And Aaron shall offer the Levites before the LORD for an offering of the children of Israel, that they may execute the service of the LORD. [bbe] And Aaron is to give the Levites to the Lord as a wave offering from the children of Israel, so that they may do the Lord\u0027s work. 8:12 [hgb] 利 未 人 要 按 手 在 那 两 只 牛 的 头 上 。 你 要 将 一 只 作 赎 罪 祭 ， 一 只 作 燔 祭 ， 献 给 耶 和 华 ， 为 利 未 人 赎 罪 。 [kjv] And the Levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of the bullocks: and thou shalt offer the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering, unto the LORD, to make an atonement for the Levites. [bbe] And the Levites are to put their hands on the heads of the oxen, and one of the oxen is to be offered for a sin-offering and the other for a burned offering to the Lord to take away the sin of the Levites. 8:13 [hgb] 你 也 要 使 利 未 人 站 在 亚 伦 和 他 儿 子 面 前 ， 将 他 们 当 作 摇 祭 奉 给 耶 和 华 。 [kjv] And thou shalt set the Levites before Aaron, and before his sons, and offer them for an offering unto the LORD. [bbe] Then the Levites are to be put before Aaron and his sons, to be offered as a wave offering to the Lord. 8:14 [hgb] 这 样 ， 你 从 以 色 列 人 中 将 利 未 人 分 别 出 来 ， 利 未 人 便 要 归 我 。 [kjv] Thus shalt thou separate the Levites from among the children of Israel: and the Levites shall be mine. [bbe] So you are to make the Levites separate from the children of Israel, and the Levites will be mine. 8:15 [hgb] 此 后 利 未 人 要 进 去 办 会 幕 的 事 ， 你 要 洁 净 他 们 ， 将 他 们 当 作 摇 祭 奉 上 。 [kjv] And after that shall the Levites go in to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation: and thou shalt cleanse them, and offer them for an offering. [bbe] After that, the Levites will go in to do whatever has to be done in the Tent of meeting; you are to make them clean and give them as a wave offering. 8:16 [hgb] 因 为 他 们 是 从 以 色 列 人 中 全 然 给 我 的 ， 我 拣 选 他 们 归 我 ， 是 代 替 以 色 列 人 中 一 切 头 生 的 。 [kjv] For they are wholly given unto me from among the children of Israel; instead of such as open every womb, even instead of the firstborn of all the children of Israel, have I taken them unto me. [bbe] For they have been given to me from among the children of Israel; in place of every mother\u0027s first son, the first to come to birth in Israel, I have taken them for myself. 8:17 [hgb] 以 色 列 人 中 一 切 头 生 的 ， 连 人 带 牲 畜 ， 都 是 我 的 。 我 在 埃 及 地 击 杀 一 切 头 生 的 那 天 ， 将 他 们 分 别 为 圣 归 我 。 [kjv] For all the firstborn of the children of Israel are mine, both man and beast: on the day that I smote every firstborn in the land of Egypt I sanctified them for myself. [bbe] For every mother\u0027s first son among the children of Israel is mine, the first male birth of man or beast: on the day when I sent death on all the first sons in the land of Egypt, I made them mine. 8:18 [hgb] 我 拣 选 利 未 人 代 替 以 色 列 人 中 一 切 头 生 的 。 [kjv] And I have taken the Levites for all the firstborn of the children of Israel. [bbe] And in place of the first sons among the children of Israel, I have taken the Levites. 8:19 [hgb] 我 从 以 色 列 人 中 将 利 未 人 当 作 赏 赐 给 亚 伦 和 他 的 儿 子 ， 在 会 幕 中 办 以 色 列 人 的 事 ， 又 为 以 色 列 人 赎 罪 ， 免 得 他 们 挨 近 圣 所 ， 有 灾 殃 临 到 他 们 中 间 。 [kjv] And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his sons from among the children of Israel, to do the service of the children of Israel in the tabernacle of the congregation, and to make an atonement for the children of Israel: that there be no plague among the children of Israel, when the children of Israel come nigh unto the sanctuary. [bbe] And I have given them to Aaron and to his sons, from among the children of Israel, to undertake for them all the work of the Tent of meeting, and to take away sin from the children of Israel so that no evil may come on them when they come near the holy place. 8:20 [hgb] 摩 西 ， 亚 伦 ， 并 以 色 列 全 会 众 便 向 利 未 人 如 此 行 。 凡 耶 和 华 指 着 利 未 人 所 吩 咐 摩 西 的 ， 以 色 列 人 就 向 他 们 这 样 行 。 [kjv] And Moses, and Aaron, and all the congregation of the children of Israel, did to the Levites according unto all that the LORD commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so did the children of Israel unto them. [bbe] All these things Moses and Aaron and the children of Israel did to the Levites; as the Lord gave orders to Moses about the Levites, so the children of Israel did. 8:21 [hgb] 于 是 利 未 人 洁 净 自 己 ， 除 了 罪 ， 洗 了 衣 服 。 亚 伦 将 他 们 当 作 摇 祭 奉 到 耶 和 华 面 前 ， 又 为 他 们 赎 罪 ， 洁 净 他 们 。 [kjv] And the Levites were purified, and they washed their clothes; and Aaron offered them as an offering before the LORD; and Aaron made an atonement for them to cleanse them. [bbe] And the Levites were made clean from sin, and their clothing was washed, and Aaron gave them for a wave offering before the Lord; and Aaron took away their sin and made them clean. 8:22 [hgb] 然 后 利 未 人 进 去 ， 在 亚 伦 和 他 儿 子 面 前 ， 在 会 幕 中 办 事 。 耶 和 华 指 着 利 未 人 怎 样 吩 咐 摩 西 ， 以 色 列 人 就 怎 样 向 他 们 行 了 。 [kjv] And after that went the Levites in to do their service in the tabernacle of the congregation before Aaron, and before his sons: as the LORD had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so did they unto them. [bbe] And then the Levites went in to do their work in the Tent of meeting before Aaron and his sons: all the orders which the Lord had given Moses about the Levites were put into effect. 8:23 [hgb] 耶 和 华 晓 谕 摩 西 说 ， [kjv] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, [bbe] And the Lord said to Moses, 8:24 [hgb] 利 未 人 是 这 样 ， 从 二 十 五 岁 以 外 ， 他 们 要 前 来 任 职 ， 办 会 幕 的 事 。 [kjv] This is it that belongeth unto the Levites: from twenty and five years old and upward they shall go in to wait upon the service of the tabernacle of the congregation: [bbe] This is the rule for the Levites: those of twenty-five years old and over are to go in and do the work of the Tent of meeting; 8:25 [hgb] 到 了 五 十 岁 要 停 工 退 任 ， 不 再 办 事 ， [kjv] And from the age of fifty years they shall cease waiting upon the service thereof, and shall serve no more: [bbe] But after they are fifty years old, they are to give up their work and do no more; 8:26 [hgb] 只 要 在 会 幕 里 ， 和 他 们 的 弟 兄 一 同 伺 候 ， 谨 守 所 吩 咐 的 ， 不 再 办 事 了 。 至 于 所 吩 咐 利 未 人 的 ， 你 要 这 样 向 他 们 行 。 [kjv] But shall minister with their brethren in the tabernacle of the congregation, to keep the charge, and shall do no service. Thus shalt thou do unto the Levites touching their charge. [bbe] But be with their brothers in the Tent of meeting, taking care of it but doing no work. This is what you are to do in connection with the Levites and their work.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/20/461.html","bookId":240,"book":{"id":240,"title":"Numbers民数记（双语小说）","description":"简介： And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the tabernacle of the congregation, on the first day of the second month, in the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying； Take ye the sum of all the ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/20","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:53 AM"}}
