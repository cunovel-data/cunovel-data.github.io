So the plague was stayed from the children of Israel. \n [bbe] And went after the man of Israel into the tent, driving the spear through the two of them, through the man of Israel and through the stomach of the woman. So the disease was stopped among the children of Israel. \n 25:9 [hgb] 那 时 遭 瘟 疫 死 的 ， 有 二 万 四 千 人 。 \n [kjv] And those that died in the plague were twenty and four thousand. \n [bbe] But twenty-four thousand of them had come to their death by the disease. \n 25:10 [hgb] 耶 和 华 晓 谕 摩 西 说 ， \n [kjv] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, \n [bbe] And the Lord said to Moses, \n 25:11 [hgb] 祭 司 亚 伦 的 孙 子 ， 以 利 亚 撒 的 儿 子 非 尼 哈 ， 使 我 向 以 色 列 人 所 发 的 怒 消 了 。 因 他 在 他 们 中 间 ， 以 我 的 忌 邪 为 心 ， 使 我 不 在 忌 邪 中 把 他 们 除 灭 。 \n [kjv] Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, hath turned my wrath away from the children of Israel, while he was zealous for my sake among them, that I consumed not the children of Israel in my jealousy. \n [bbe] Through Phinehas, and because of his passion for my honour, my wrath has been turned away from the children of Israel, so that I have not sent destruction on them all in my wrath. \n 25:12 [hgb] 因 此 ， 你 要 说 ， 我 将 我 平 安 的 约 赐 给 他 。 \n [kjv] Wherefore say, Behold, I give unto him my covenant of peace: \n [bbe] So say to them that I will make with him an agreement of peace: \n 25:13 [hgb] 这 约 要 给 他 和 他 的 后 裔 ， 作 为 永 远 当 祭 司 职 任 的 约 。 因 他 为 神 ， 有 忌 邪 的 心 ， 为 以 色 列 人 赎 罪 。 \n [kjv] And he shall have it, and his seed after him, even the covenant of an everlasting priesthood; because he was zealous for his God, and made an atonement for the children of Israel. \n [bbe] And by this agreement, he and his sons after him have the right to be priests for ever; because, by his care for the honour of his God, he took away the sin of the children of Israel. \n 25:14 [hgb] 那 与 米 甸 女 人 一 同 被 杀 的 以 色 列 人 ， 名 叫 心 利 ， 是 撒 路 的 儿 子 ， 是 西 缅 一 个 宗 族 的 首 领 。 \n [kjv] Now the name of the Israelite that was slain, even that was slain with the Midianitish woman, was Zimri, the son of Salu, a prince of a chief house among the Simeonites. \n [bbe] Now the man of Israel who was put to death with the woman of Midian was Zimri, the son of Salu, a chief of one of the families of the Simeonites. \n 25:15 [hgb] 那 被 杀 的 米 甸 女 人 ， 名 叫 哥 斯 比 ， 是 苏 珥 的 女 儿 。 这 苏 珥 是 米 甸 一 个 宗 族 的 首 领 。 \n [kjv] And the name of the Midianitish woman that was slain was Cozbi, the daughter of Zur; he was head over a people, and of a chief house in Midian. \n [bbe] And the woman of Midian who was put to death was Cozbi, the daughter of Zur; he was the head of a family in Midian. \n 25:16 [hgb] 耶 和 华 晓 谕 摩 西 说 ， \n [kjv] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, \n [bbe] Then the Lord said to Moses, \n 25:17 [hgb] 你 要 扰 害 米 甸 人 ， 击 杀 他 们 。 \n [kjv] Vex the Midianites, and smite them: \n [bbe] Take up arms against the Midianites and overcome them; \n 25:18 [hgb] 因 为 他 们 用 诡 计 扰 害 你 们 ， 在 毗 珥 的 事 上 和 他 们 的 姊 妹 ， 米 甸 首 领 的 女 儿 哥 斯 比 的 事 上 ， 用 这 诡 计 诱 惑 了 你 们 。 这 哥 斯 比 ， 当 瘟 疫 流 行 的 日 子 ， 因 毗 珥 的 事 被 杀 了 。 \n [kjv] For they vex you with their wiles, wherewith they have beguiled you in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of a prince of Midian, their sister, which was slain in the day of the plague for Peor\u0027s sake. \n [bbe] For they are a danger to you with their false ways, causing sin to come on you in the question of Peor, and because of Cozbi, their sister, the daughter of the chief of Midian, who was put to death at the time of the disease which came on you because of Peor. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/20/478.html","bookId":240,"book":{"id":240,"title":"Numbers民数记（双语小说）","description":"简介： And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the tabernacle of the congregation, on the first day of the second month, in the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying； Take ye the sum of all the ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/20","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:53 AM"}}
