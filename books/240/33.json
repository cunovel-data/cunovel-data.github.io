[bbe] And take the land for yourselves, for your resting-place: for to you I have given the land as your heritage. 33:54 [hgb] 你 们 要 按 家 室 拈 阄 ， 承 受 那 地 。 人 多 的 ， 要 把 产 业 多 分 给 他 们 。 人 少 的 ， 要 把 产 业 少 分 给 他 们 。 拈 出 何 地 给 何 人 ， 就 要 归 何 人 。 你 们 要 按 宗 族 的 支 派 承 受 。 [kjv] And ye shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance among your families: and to the more ye shall give the more inheritance, and to the fewer ye shall give the less inheritance: every man\u0027s inheritance shall be in the place where his lot falleth; according to the tribes of your fathers ye shall inherit. [bbe] And you will take up your heritage in the land by the decision of the Lord, to every family its part; the greater the family the greater its heritage, and the smaller the family the smaller will be its heritage; wherever the decision of the Lord gives to any man his part, that will be his; distribution will be made to you by your fathers\u0027 tribes. 33:55 [hgb] 倘 若 你 们 不 赶 出 那 地 的 居 民 ， 所 容 留 的 居 民 就 必 作 你 们 眼 中 的 刺 ， 肋 下 的 荆 棘 ， 也 必 在 你 们 所 住 的 地 上 扰 害 你 们 。 [kjv] But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you; then it shall come to pass, that those which ye let remain of them shall be pricks in your eyes, and thorns in your sides, and shall vex you in the land wherein ye dwell. [bbe] But if you are slow in driving out the people of the land, then those of them who are still there will be like pin-points in your eyes and like thorns in your sides, troubling you in the land where you are living. 33:56 [hgb] 而 且 我 素 常 有 意 怎 样 待 他 们 ， 也 必 照 样 待 你 们 。 [kjv] Moreover it shall come to pass, that I shall do unto you, as I thought to do unto them. [bbe] And it will come about that as it was my purpose to do to them, so I will do to you.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/20/486.html","bookId":240,"book":{"id":240,"title":"Numbers民数记（双语小说）","description":"简介： And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the tabernacle of the congregation, on the first day of the second month, in the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying； Take ye the sum of all the ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/20","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:53 AM"}}
