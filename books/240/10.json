of a whole piece shalt thou make them: that thou mayest use them for the calling of the assembly, and for the journeying of the camps. \n [bbe] Make two silver horns of hammered work, to be used for getting the people together and to give the sign for the moving of the tents. \n 10:3 [hgb] 吹 这 号 的 时 候 ， 全 会 众 要 到 你 那 里 ， 聚 集 在 会 幕 门 口 。 \n [kjv] And when they shall blow with them, all the assembly shall assemble themselves to thee at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. \n [bbe] When they are sounded, all the people are to come together to you at the door of the Tent of meeting. \n 10:4 [hgb] 若 单 吹 一 枝 ， 众 首 领 ， 就 是 以 色 列 军 中 的 统 领 ， 要 聚 集 到 你 那 里 。 \n [kjv] And if they blow but with one trumpet, then the princes, which are heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather themselves unto thee. \n [bbe] If only one of them is sounded, then the chiefs, the heads of the thousands of Israel, are to come to you. \n 10:5 [hgb] 吹 出 大 声 的 时 候 ， 东 边 安 的 营 都 要 起 行 。 \n [kjv] When ye blow an alarm, then the camps that lie on the east parts shall go forward. \n [bbe] When a loud note is sounded, the tents placed on the east side are to go forward. \n 10:6 [hgb] 二 次 吹 出 大 声 的 时 候 ， 南 边 安 的 营 都 要 起 行 。 他 们 将 起 行 ， 必 吹 出 大 声 。 \n [kjv] When ye blow an alarm the second time, then the camps that lie on the south side shall take their journey: they shall blow an alarm for their journeys. \n [bbe] At the sound of a second loud note, the tents on the south side are to go forward: the loud note will be the sign to go forward. \n 10:7 [hgb] 但 招 聚 会 众 的 时 候 ， 你 们 要 吹 号 ， 却 不 要 吹 出 大 声 。 \n [kjv] But when the congregation is to be gathered together, ye shall blow, but ye shall not sound an alarm. \n [bbe] But when all the people are to come together, the horn is to be sounded but not loudly. \n 10:8 [hgb] 亚 伦 子 孙 作 祭 司 的 要 吹 这 号 。 这 要 作 你 们 世 世 代 代 永 远 的 定 例 。 \n [kjv] And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow with the trumpets; and they shall be to you for an ordinance for ever throughout your generations. \n [bbe] The horns are to be sounded by the sons of Aaron, the priests; this is to be a law for you for ever, from generation to generation. \n 10:9 [hgb] 你 们 在 自 己 的 地 ， 与 欺 压 你 们 的 敌 人 打 仗 ， 就 要 用 号 吹 出 大 声 ， 便 在 耶 和 华 你 们 的 神 面 前 得 蒙 纪 念 ， 也 蒙 拯 救 脱 离 仇 敌 。 \n [kjv] And if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that oppresseth you, then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets; and ye shall be remembered before the LORD your God, and ye shall be saved from your enemies. \n [bbe] And if you go to war in your land against any who do you wrong, then let the loud note of the horn be sounded; and the Lord your God will keep you in mind and give you salvation from those who are against you. \n 10:10 [hgb] 在 你 们 快 乐 的 日 子 和 节 期 ， 并 月 朔 ， 献 燔 祭 和 平 安 祭 ， 也 要 吹 号 ， 这 都 要 在 你 们 的 神 面 前 作 为 纪 念 。 我 是 耶 和 华 你 们 的 神 。 \n [kjv] Also in the day of your gladness, and in your solemn days, and in the beginnings of your months, ye shall blow with the trumpets over your burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings; that they may be to you for a memorial before your God: I am the LORD your God. \n [bbe] And on days of joy and on your regular feasts and on the first day of every month, let the horns be sounded over your burned offerings and your peace-offerings; and they will put the Lord in mind of you: I am the Lord your God. \n 10:11 [hgb] 第 二 年 二 月 二 十 日 ， 云 彩 从 法 柜 的 帐 幕 收 上 去 。 \n [kjv] And it came to pass on the twentieth day of the second month, in the second year, that the cloud was taken up from off the tabernacle of the testimony. \n [bbe] Now in the second year, on the twentieth day of the second month, the cloud was taken up from over the Tent of witness. \n 10:12 [hgb] 以 色 列 人 就 按 站 往 前 行 ， 离 开 西 乃 的 旷 野 ， 云 彩 停 住 在 巴 兰 的 旷 野 。 \n [kjv] And the children of Israel took their journeys out of the wilderness of Sinai;

so they went forward. \n 10:29 [hgb] 摩 西 对 他 岳 父 （ 或 作 内 兄 ） 米 甸 人 流 珥 的 儿 子 何 巴 说 ， 我 们 要 行 路 ， 往 耶 和 华 所 应 许 之 地 去 。 他 曾 说 ， 我 要 将 这 地 赐 给 你 们 。 现 在 求 你 和 我 们 同 去 ， 我 们 必 厚 待 你 ， 因 为 耶 和 华 指 着 以 色 列 人 已 经 应 许 给 好 处 。 \n [kjv] And Moses said unto Hobab, the son of Raguel the Midianite, Moses\u0027 father in law, We are journeying unto the place of which the LORD said, I will give it you: come thou with us, and we will do thee good: for the LORD hath spoken good concerning Israel. \n [bbe] Then Moses said to Hobab, the son of his father-in-law Reuel the Midianite, We are journeying to that place of which the Lord has said, I will give it to you: so come with us, and it will be for your profit: for the Lord has good things in store for Israel. \n 10:30 [hgb] 何 巴 回 答 说 ， 我 不 去 。 我 要 回 本 地 本 族 那 里 去 。 \n [kjv] And he said unto him, I will not go;

forasmuch as thou knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and thou mayest be to us instead of eyes. \n [bbe] And he said, Do not go from us; for you will be eyes for us, guiding us to the right places in the waste land to put up our tents. \n 10:32 [hgb] 你 若 和 我 们 同 去 ， 将 来 耶 和 华 有 什 么 好 处 待 我 们 ， 我 们 也 必 以 什 么 好 处 待 你 。 \n [kjv] And it shall be, if thou go with us, yea, it shall be, that what goodness the LORD shall do unto us, the same will we do unto thee. \n [bbe] And if you come with us, we will give you a part in whatever good the Lord does for us. \n 10:33 [hgb] 以 色 列 人 离 开 耶 和 华 的 山 ， 往 前 行 了 三 天 的 路 程 。 耶 和 华 的 约 柜 在 前 头 行 了 三 天 的 路 程 ， 为 他 们 寻 找 安 歇 的 地 方 。 \n [kjv] And they departed from the mount of the LORD three days\u0027 journey: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD went before them in the three days\u0027 journey, to search out a resting place for them. \n [bbe] So they went forward three days\u0027 journey from the mountain of the Lord;

and let them that hate thee flee before thee. \n [bbe] And when the ark went forward Moses said, Come up, O Lord, and let the armies of those who are against you be broken, and let your haters go in flight before you. \n 10:36 [hgb] 约 柜 停 住 的 时 候 ， 他 就 说 ， 耶 和 华 阿 ， 求 你 回 到 以 色 列 的 千 万 人 中 。 \n [kjv] And when it rested, he said, Return, O LORD, unto the many thousands of Israel. \n [bbe] And when it came to rest, he said, Take rest, O Lord, and give a blessing to the families of Israel. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/20/463.html","bookId":240,"book":{"id":240,"title":"Numbers民数记（双语小说）","description":"简介： And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the tabernacle of the congregation, on the first day of the second month, in the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying； Take ye the sum of all the ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/20","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:53 AM"}}
