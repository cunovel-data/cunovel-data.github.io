{"id":7343,"no":27,"title":"Chapter 27","content":"27:1 [hgb] 属 约 瑟 的 儿 子 玛 拿 西 的 各 族 ， 有 玛 拿 西 的 玄 孙 ， 玛 吉 的 曾 孙 ， 基 列 的 孙 子 ， 希 弗 的 儿 子 西 罗 非 哈 的 女 儿 ， 名 叫 玛 拉 ， 挪 阿 ， 曷 拉 ， 密 迦 ， 得 撒 。 她 们 前 来 ， [kjv] Then came the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of Manasseh the son of Joseph: and these are the names of his daughters; Mahlah, Noah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Tirzah. [bbe] Then the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of Manasseh, the son of Joseph, came forward: their names are Mahlah, Noah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Tirzah. 27:2 [hgb] 站 在 会 幕 门 口 ， 在 摩 西 和 祭 司 以 利 亚 撒 ， 并 众 首 领 与 全 会 众 面 前 ， 说 ， [kjv] And they stood before Moses, and before Eleazar the priest, and before the princes and all the congregation, by the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying, [bbe] They came before Moses and Eleazar the priest and the chiefs and all the people at the door of the Tent of meeting, and said, 27:3 [hgb] 我 们 的 父 亲 死 在 旷 野 。 他 不 与 可 拉 同 党 聚 集 攻 击 耶 和 华 ， 是 在 自 己 罪 中 死 的 。 他 也 没 有 儿 子 。 [kjv] Our father died in the wilderness, and he was not in the company of them that gathered themselves together against the LORD in the company of Korah; but died in his own sin, and had no sons. [bbe] Death overtook our father in the waste land; he was not among those who were banded together with Korah against the Lord; but death came to him in his sin; and he had no sons. 27:4 [hgb] 为 什 么 因 我 们 的 父 亲 没 有 儿 子 就 把 他 的 名 从 他 族 中 除 掉 呢 ？ 求 你 们 在 我 们 父 亲 的 弟 兄 中 分 给 我 们 产 业 。 [kjv] Why should the name of our father be done away from among his family, because he hath no son? Give unto us therefore a possession among the brethren of our father. [bbe] Why is the name of our father to be taken away from among his family, because he had no son? Give us a heritage among our father\u0027s brothers. 27:5 [hgb] 于 是 ， 摩 西 将 她 们 的 案 件 呈 到 耶 和 华 面 前 。 [kjv] And Moses brought their cause before the LORD. [bbe] So Moses put their cause before the Lord. 27:6 [hgb] 耶 和 华 晓 谕 摩 西 说 ， [kjv] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, [bbe] And the Lord said to Moses, 27:7 [hgb] 西 罗 非 哈 的 女 儿 说 得 有 理 。 你 定 要 在 她 们 父 亲 的 弟 兄 中 ， 把 地 分 给 她 们 为 业 。 要 将 她 们 父 亲 的 产 业 归 给 她 们 。 [kjv] The daughters of Zelophehad speak right: thou shalt surely give them a possession of an inheritance among their father\u0027s brethren; and thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father to pass unto them. [bbe] What the daughters of Zelophehad say is right: certainly you are to give them a heritage among their father\u0027s brothers: and let the property which would have been their father\u0027s go to them. 27:8 [hgb] 你 也 要 晓 谕 以 色 列 人 说 ， 人 若 死 了 没 有 儿 子 ， 就 要 把 他 的 产 业 归 给 他 的 女 儿 。 [kjv] And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a man die, and have no son, then ye shall cause his inheritance to pass unto his daughter. [bbe] And say to the children of Israel, If a man has no son at the time of his death, let his heritage go to his daughter. 27:9 [hgb] 他 若 没 有 女 儿 ， 就 要 把 他 的 产 业 给 他 的 弟 兄 。 [kjv] And if he have no daughter, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his brethren. [bbe] And if he has no daughter, then give his heritage to his brothers. 27:10 [hgb] 他 若 没 有 弟 兄 ， 就 要 把 他 的 产 业 给 他 父 亲 的 弟 兄 。 [kjv] And if he have no brethren, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his father\u0027s brethren. [bbe] And if he has no brothers, then give his heritage to his father\u0027s brothers. 27:11 [hgb] 他 父 亲 若 没 有 弟 兄 ， 就 要 把 他 的 产 业 给 他 族 中 最 近 的 亲 属 ， 他 便 要 得 为 业 。 这 要 作 以 色 列 人 的 律 例 典 章 ， 是 照 耶 和 华 吩 咐 摩 西 的 。 [kjv] And if his father have no brethren, then ye shall give his inheritance unto his kinsman that is next to him of his family, and he shall possess it: and it shall be unto the children of Israel a statute of judgment, as the LORD commanded Moses. [bbe] And if his father has no brothers, then give it to his nearest relation in the family, as his heritage: this is to be a decision made by law for the children of Israel, as the Lord gave orders to Moses. 27:12 [hgb] 耶 和 华 对 摩 西 说 ， 你 上 这 亚 巴 琳 山 ， 观 看 我 所 赐 给 以 色 列 人 的 地 。 [kjv] And the LORD said unto Moses, Get thee up into this mount Abarim, and see the land which I have given unto the children of Israel. [bbe] And the Lord said to Moses, Go up into this mountain of Abarim so that you may see the land which I have given to the children of Israel. 27:13 [hgb] 看 了 以 后 ， 你 也 必 归 到 你 列 祖 （ 原 文 作 本 民 ） 那 里 ， 象 你 哥 哥 亚 伦 一 样 。 [kjv] And when thou hast seen it, thou also shalt be gathered unto thy people, as Aaron thy brother was gathered. [bbe] And when you have seen it, you will be put to rest with your people, as your brother Aaron was: 27:14 [hgb] 因 为 你 们 在 寻 的 旷 野 ， 当 会 众 争 闹 的 时 候 ， 违 背 了 我 的 命 ， 没 有 在 涌 水 之 地 ， 会 众 眼 前 尊 我 为 圣 。 （ 这 水 就 是 寻 的 旷 野 加 低 斯 米 利 巴 水 。 ） [kjv] For ye rebelled against my commandment in the desert of Zin, in the strife of the congregation, to sanctify me at the water before their eyes: that is the water of Meribah in Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin. [bbe] Because in the waste land of Zin, when the people were angry, you and he went against my word and did not keep my name holy before their eyes, at the waters. (These are the waters of Meribah in Kadesh in the waste land of Zin.) 27:15 [hgb] 摩 西 对 耶 和 华 说 ， [kjv] And Moses spake unto the LORD, saying, [bbe] Then Moses said to the Lord, 27:16 [hgb] 愿 耶 和 华 万 人 之 灵 的 神 ， 立 一 个 人 治 理 会 众 ， [kjv] Let the LORD, the God of the spirits of all flesh, set a man over the congregation, [bbe] Let the Lord, the God of the spirits of all flesh, put a man at the head of this people, 27:17 [hgb] 可 以 在 他 们 面 前 出 入 ， 也 可 以 引 导 他 们 ， 免 得 耶 和 华 的 会 众 如 同 没 有 牧 人 的 羊 群 一 般 。 [kjv] Which may go out before them, and which may go in before them, and which may lead them out, and which may bring them in; that the congregation of the LORD be not as sheep which have no shepherd. [bbe] To go out and come in before them and be their guide; so that the people of the Lord may not be like sheep without a keeper. 27:18 [hgb] 耶 和 华 对 摩 西 说 ， 嫩 的 儿 子 约 书 亚 ， 是 心 中 有 圣 灵 的 ， 你 将 他 领 来 按 手 在 他 头 上 ， [kjv] And the LORD said unto Moses, Take thee Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is the spirit, and lay thine hand upon him; [bbe] And the Lord said to Moses, Take Joshua, the son of Nun, a man in whom is the spirit, and put your hand on him; 27:19 [hgb] 使 他 站 在 祭 司 以 利 亚 撒 和 全 会 众 面 前 ， 嘱 咐 他 ， [kjv] And set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation; and give him a charge in their sight. [bbe] And take him before Eleazar the priest and all the meeting of the people, and give him his orders before their eyes. 27:20 [hgb] 又 将 你 的 尊 荣 给 他 几 分 ， 使 以 色 列 全 会 众 都 听 从 他 。 [kjv] And thou shalt put some of thine honour upon him, that all the congregation of the children of Israel may be obedient. [bbe] And put your honour on him, so that all the children of Israel may be under his authority. 27:21 [hgb] 他 要 站 在 祭 司 以 利 亚 撒 面 前 。 以 利 亚 撒 要 凭 乌 陵 的 判 断 ， 在 耶 和 华 面 前 为 他 求 问 。 他 和 以 色 列 全 会 众 都 要 遵 以 利 亚 撒 的 命 出 入 。 [kjv] And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall ask counsel for him after the judgment of Urim before the LORD: at his word shall they go out, and at his word they shall come in, both he, and all the children of Israel with him, even all the congregation. [bbe] He will take his place before Eleazar the priest, so that he may get directions from the Lord for him, with the Urim: at his word they will go out, and at his word they will come in, he and all the children of Israel. 27:22 [hgb] 于 是 摩 西 照 耶 和 华 所 吩 咐 的 将 约 书 亚 领 来 ， 使 他 站 在 祭 司 以 利 亚 撒 和 全 会 众 面 前 。 [kjv] And Moses did as the LORD commanded him: and he took Joshua, and set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation: [bbe] So Moses did as the Lord said: he took Joshua and put him before Eleazar the priest and the meeting of the people: 27:23 [hgb] 按 手 在 他 头 上 ， 嘱 咐 他 ， 是 照 耶 和 华 借 摩 西 所 说 的 话 。 [kjv] And he laid his hands upon him, and gave him a charge, as the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses. [bbe] And he put his hands on him and gave him his orders, as the Lord had said by Moses.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/20/480.html","bookId":240,"book":{"id":240,"title":"Numbers民数记（双语小说）","description":"简介： And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the tabernacle of the congregation, on the first day of the second month, in the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying； Take ye the sum of all the ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/20","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:53 AM"}}
