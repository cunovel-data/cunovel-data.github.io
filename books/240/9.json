and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day: \\n\\n 9:7 [hgb] 说 ， 我 们 虽 因 死 尸 而 不 洁 净 ， 为 何 被 阻 止 ， 不 得 同 以 色 列 人 在 所 定 的 日 期 献 耶 和 华 的 供 物 呢 ？ \\n\\n [kjv] And those men said unto him, We are defiled by the dead body of a man: wherefore are we kept back, that we may not offer an offering of the LORD in his appointed season among the children of Israel? \\n\\n [bbe] And these men said to him, We have been made unclean by the dead body of a man; why may we not make the offering of the Lord at the regular time among the children of Israel? \\n\\n 9:8 [hgb] 摩 西 对 他 们 说 ， 你 们 暂 且 等 候 ， 我 可 以 去 听 耶 和 华 指 着 你 们 是 怎 样 吩 咐 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And Moses said unto them, Stand still, and I will hear what the LORD will command concerning you. \\n\\n [bbe] And Moses said to them, Do nothing till the Lord gives me directions about you. \\n\\n 9:9 [hgb] 耶 和 华 对 摩 西 说 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, \\n\\n [bbe] And the Lord said to Moses, \\n\\n 9:10 [hgb] 你 晓 谕 以 色 列 人 说 ， 你 们 和 你 们 后 代 中 ， 若 有 人 因 死 尸 而 不 洁 净 ， 或 在 远 方 行 路 ， 还 要 向 耶 和 华 守 逾 越 节 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If any man of you or of your posterity shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or be in a journey afar off, yet he shall keep the passover unto the LORD. \\n\\n [bbe] Say to the children of Israel, If any one of you or of your families is unclean because of a dead body, or is on a journey far away, still he is to keep the Passover to the Lord: \\n\\n 9:11 [hgb] 他 们 要 在 二 月 十 四 日 黄 昏 的 时 候 ， 守 逾 越 节 。 要 用 无 酵 饼 与 苦 菜 ， 和 逾 越 节 的 羊 羔 同 吃 。 \\n\\n [kjv] The fourteenth day of the second month at even they shall keep it, and eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs. \\n\\n [bbe] In the second month, on the fourteenth day, in the evening, they are to keep it, taking it with unleavened bread and bitter-tasting plants; \\n\\n 9:12 [hgb] 一 点 不 可 留 到 早 晨 。 羊 羔 的 骨 头 一 根 也 不 可 折 断 。 他 们 要 照 逾 越 节 的 一 切 律 例 而 守 。 \\n\\n [kjv] They shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break any bone of it: according to all the ordinances of the passover they shall keep it. \\n\\n [bbe] Nothing of it is to be kept till the morning, and no bone of it is to be broken: they are to keep it by the rules of the Passover. \\n\\n 9:13 [hgb] 那 洁 净 而 不 行 路 的 人 若 推 辞 不 守 逾 越 节 ， 那 人 要 从 民 中 剪 除 。 因 为 他 在 所 定 的 日 期 不 献 耶 和 华 的 供 物 ， 应 该 担 当 他 的 罪 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But the man that is clean, and is not in a journey, and forbeareth to keep the passover, even the same soul shall be cut off from among his people: because he brought not the offering of the LORD in his appointed season, that man shall bear his sin. \\n\\n [bbe] But the man who, not being unclean or on a journey, does not keep the Passover, will be cut off from his people: because he did not make the offering of the Lord at the regular time, his sin will be on him. \\n\\n 9:14 [hgb] 若 有 外 人 寄 居 在 你 们 中 间 ， 愿 意 向 耶 和 华 守 逾 越 节 ， 他 要 照 逾 越 节 的 律 例 典 章 行 ， 不 管 是 寄 居 的 是 本 地 人 ， 同 归 一 例 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the passover unto the LORD; according to the ordinance of the passover, and according to the manner thereof, so shall he do: ye shall have one ordinance, both for the stranger, and for him that was born in the land. \\n\\n [bbe] And if a man from another country is among you and has a desire to keep the Passover to the Lord, let him do as is ordered in the law of the Passover: there is to be the same rule for the man from another nation and for him who had his birth in the land. \\n\\n 9:15 [hgb] 立 起 帐 幕 的 那 日 ， 有 云 彩 遮 盖 帐 幕 ， 就 是 法 柜 的 帐 幕 。 从 晚 上 到 早 晨 ， 云 彩 在 其 上 ， 形 状 如 火 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud covered the tabernacle, namely, the tent of the testimony: and at even there was upon the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until the morning. \\n\\n [bbe] And on the day when the House was put up, the cloud came down on it, on the Tent of witness; and in the evening there was a light like fire over the House till the morning. \\n\\n 9:16 [hgb] 常 是 这 样 ， 云 彩 遮 盖 帐 幕 ， 夜 间 形 状 如 火 。 \\n\\n [kjv] So it was alway: the cloud covered it by day, and the appearance of fire by night. \\n\\n [bbe] And so it was at all times: it was covered by the cloud, and by a light as of fire by night. \\n\\n 9:17 [hgb] 云 彩 几 时 从 帐 幕 收 上 去 ， 以 色 列 人 就 几 时 起 行 。 云 彩 在 哪 里 停 住 ， 以 色 列 人 就 在 那 里 安 营 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, then after that the children of Israel journeyed: and in the place where the cloud abode, there the children of Israel pitched their tents. \\n\\n [bbe] And whenever the cloud was taken up from over the House, then the children of Israel went journeying on; and in the place where the cloud came to rest, there the children of Israel put up their tents. \\n\\n 9:18 [hgb] 以 色 列 人 遵 耶 和 华 的 吩 咐 起 行 ， 也 遵 耶 和 华 的 吩 咐 安 营 。 云 彩 在 帐 幕 上 停 住 几 时 ， 他 们 就 住 营 几 时 。 \\n\\n [kjv] At the commandment of the LORD the children of Israel journeyed, and at the commandment of the LORD they pitched: as long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they rested in their tents. \\n\\n [bbe] At the order of the Lord the children of Israel went forward, and at the order of the Lord they put up their tents: as long as the cloud was resting on the House, they did not go away from that place. \\n\\n 9:19 [hgb] 云 彩 在 帐 幕 上 停 留 许 多 日 子 ， 以 色 列 人 就 守 耶 和 华 所 吩 咐 的 不 起 行 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days, then the children of Israel kept the charge of the LORD, and journeyed not. \\n\\n [bbe] When the cloud was resting on the House for a long time the children of Israel, waiting for the order of the Lord, did not go on. \\n\\n 9:20 [hgb] 有 时 云 彩 在 帐 幕 上 几 天 ， 他 们 就 照 耶 和 华 的 吩 咐 住 营 ， 也 照 耶 和 华 的 吩 咐 起 行 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And so it was, when the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle; according to the commandment of the LORD they abode in their tents, and according to the commandment of the LORD they journeyed. \\n\\n [bbe] Sometimes the cloud was resting on the House for two or three days; then, by the order of the Lord, they kept their tents in that place, and when the Lord gave the order they went on. \\n\\n 9:21 [hgb] 有 时 从 晚 上 到 早 晨 ， 有 这 云 彩 在 帐 幕 上 。 早 晨 云 彩 收 上 去 ， 他 们 就 起 行 。 有 时 昼 夜 云 彩 停 在 帐 幕 上 ， 收 上 去 的 时 候 ， 他 们 就 起 行 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And so it was, when the cloud abode from even unto the morning, and that the cloud was taken up in the morning, then they journeyed: whether it was by day or by night that the cloud was taken up, they journeyed. \\n\\n [bbe] And sometimes the cloud was there only from evening to morning; and when the cloud was taken up in the morning they went on their journey again: or if it was resting there by day and by night, whenever the cloud was taken up they went forward. \\n\\n 9:22 [hgb] 云 彩 停 留 在 帐 幕 上 ， 无 论 是 两 天 ， 是 一 月 ， 是 一 年 ， 以 色 列 人 就 住 营 不 起 行 。 但 云 彩 收 上 去 ， 他 们 就 起 行 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Or whether it were two days, or a month, or a year, that the cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, remaining thereon, the children of Israel abode in their tents, and journeyed not: but when it was taken up, they journeyed. \\n\\n [bbe] Or if the cloud came to rest on the House for two days or a month or a year without moving, the children of Israel went on waiting there and did not go on; but whenever it was taken up they went forward on their journey. \\n\\n 9:23 [hgb] 他 们 遵 耶 和 华 的 吩 咐 安 营 ， 也 遵 耶 和 华 的 吩 咐 起 行 。 他 们 守 耶 和 华 所 吩 咐 的 ， 都 是 凭 耶 和 华 吩 咐 摩 西 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] At the commandment of the LORD they rested in the tents, and at the commandment of the LORD they journeyed: they kept the charge of the LORD, at the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses. \\n\\n [bbe] At the word of the Lord they put up their tents, and at the word of the Lord they went forward on their journey: they kept the orders of the Lord as he gave them by Moses. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/20/462.html","bookId":240,"book":{"id":240,"title":"Numbers民数记（双语小说）","description":"简介： And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the tabernacle of the congregation, on the first day of the second month, in the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying； Take ye the sum of all the ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/20","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:53 AM"}}
