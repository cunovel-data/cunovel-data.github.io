[bbe] And when the Tent of meeting goes forward, the Levites are to take it down; and when it is to be put up, they are to do it: any strange person who comes near it is to be put to death. 1:52 [hgb] 以 色 列 人 支 搭 帐 棚 ， 要 照 他 们 的 军 队 ， 各 归 本 营 ， 各 归 本 纛 。 [kjv] And the children of Israel shall pitch their tents, every man by his own camp, and every man by his own standard, throughout their hosts. [bbe] The children of Israel are to put up their tents, every man in his tent-circle round his flag. 1:53 [hgb] 但 利 未 人 要 在 法 柜 帐 幕 的 四 围 安 营 ， 免 得 忿 怒 临 到 以 色 列 会 众 。 利 未 人 并 要 谨 守 法 柜 的 帐 幕 。 [kjv] But the Levites shall pitch round about the tabernacle of testimony, that there be no wrath upon the congregation of the children of Israel: and the Levites shall keep the charge of the tabernacle of testimony. [bbe] But the tents of the Levites are to be round the Tent of meeting, so that wrath may not come on the children of Israel: the Tent of meeting is to be in the care of the Levites. 1:54 [hgb] 以 色 列 人 就 这 样 行 。 凡 耶 和 华 所 吩 咐 摩 西 的 ， 他 们 就 照 样 行 了 。 [kjv] And the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did they. [bbe] So the children of Israel did as the Lord had given orders to Moses.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/20/335.html","bookId":240,"book":{"id":240,"title":"Numbers民数记（双语小说）","description":"简介： And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the tabernacle of the congregation, on the first day of the second month, in the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying； Take ye the sum of all the ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/20","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:53 AM"}}
