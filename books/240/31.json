and they slew all the males. \n [bbe] And they made war on Midian, as the Lord gave orders to Moses; and they put to death every male. \n 31:8 [hgb] 在 所 杀 的 人 中 ， 杀 了 米 甸 的 五 王 ， 就 是 以 未 ， 利 金 ， 苏 珥 ， 户 珥 ， 利 巴 ， 又 用 刀 杀 了 比 珥 的 儿 子 巴 兰 。 \n [kjv] And they slew the kings of Midian, beside the rest of them that were slain; namely, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, five kings of Midian: Balaam also the son of Beor they slew with the sword. \n [bbe] They put the kings of Midian to death with the rest, Evi and Reken and Zur and Hur and Reba, the five kings of Midian: and Balaam, the son of Beor, they put to death with the sword. \n 31:9 [hgb] 以 色 列 人 掳 了 米 甸 人 的 妇 女 孩 子 ， 并 将 他 们 的 牲 畜 ， 羊 群 ， 和 所 有 的 财 物 都 夺 了 来 ， 当 作 掳 物 ， \n [kjv] And the children of Israel took all the women of Midian captives, and their little ones, and took the spoil of all their cattle, and all their flocks, and all their goods. \n [bbe] The women of Midian with their little ones the children of Israel took prisoner; and all their cattle and flocks and all their goods they took for themselves; \n 31:10 [hgb] 又 用 火 焚 烧 他 们 所 住 的 城 邑 和 所 有 的 营 寨 ， \n [kjv] And they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelt, and all their goodly castles, with fire. \n [bbe] And after burning all their towns and all their tent-circles, \n 31:11 [hgb] 把 一 切 所 夺 的 ， 所 掳 的 ， 连 人 带 牲 畜 都 带 了 去 ， \n [kjv] And they took all the spoil, and all the prey, both of men and of beasts. \n [bbe] They went away with the goods they had taken, man and beast. \n 31:12 [hgb] 将 所 掳 的 人 ， 所 夺 的 牲 畜 ， 财 物 ， 都 带 到 摩 押 平 原 ， 在 约 旦 河 边 与 耶 利 哥 相 对 的 营 盘 ， 交 给 摩 西 和 祭 司 以 利 亚 撒 ， 并 以 色 列 的 会 众 。 \n [kjv] And they brought the captives, and the prey, and the spoil, unto Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and unto the congregation of the children of Israel, unto the camp at the plains of Moab, which are by Jordan near Jericho. \n [bbe] And the prisoners and the goods and everything they had taken, they took to Moses and Eleazar the priest and the people of Israel, to the tent-circle in the lowlands of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho. \n 31:13 [hgb] 摩 西 和 祭 司 以 利 亚 撒 ， 并 会 众 一 切 的 首 领 ， 都 出 到 营 外 迎 接 他 们 。 \n [kjv] And Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of the congregation, went forth to meet them without the camp. \n [bbe] Then Moses and Eleazar the priest and the chiefs of the people went out to them before they had come into the tent-circle. \n 31:14 [hgb] 摩 西 向 打 仗 回 来 的 军 长 ， 就 是 千 夫 长 ， 百 夫 长 ， 发 怒 ， \n [kjv] And Moses was wroth with the officers of the host, with the captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, which came from the battle. \n [bbe] And Moses was angry with the chiefs of the army, the captains of thousands and the captains of hundreds who had come back from the war. \n 31:15 [hgb] 对 他 们 说 ， 你 们 要 存 留 这 一 切 妇 女 的 活 命 吗 ？ \n [kjv] And Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive? \n [bbe] And Moses said to them, Why have you kept all the women safe? \n 31:16 [hgb] 这 些 妇 女 因 巴 兰 的 计 谋 ， 叫 以 色 列 人 在 毗 珥 的 事 上 得 罪 耶 和 华 ， 以 致 耶 和 华 的 会 众 遭 遇 瘟 疫 。 \n [kjv] Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against the LORD in the matter of Peor, and there was a plague among the congregation of the LORD. \n [bbe] It was these who, moved by Balaam, were the cause of Israel\u0027s sin against the Lord in the question of Peor, because of which disease came on the people of the Lord. \n 31:17 [hgb] 所 以 ， 你 们 要 把 一 切 的 男 孩 和 所 有 已 嫁 的 女 子 都 杀 了 。 \n [kjv] Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every woman that hath known man by lying with him. \n [bbe] So now put every male child to death, and every woman who has had sex relations with a man. \n 31:18 [hgb] 但 女 孩 子 中 ， 凡 没 有 出 嫁 的 ， 你 们 都 可 以 存 留 她 的 活 命 。 \n [kjv] But all the women children, that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves. \n [bbe] But all the female children who have had no sex relations with men, you may keep for yourselves. \n 31:19 [hgb] 你 们 要 在 营 外 驻 扎 七 日 。 凡 杀 了 人 的 ， 和 一 切 摸 了 被 杀 的 ， 并 你 们 所 掳 来 的 人 口 ， 第 三 日 ， 第 七 日 ， 都 要 洁 净 自 己 ， \n [kjv] And do ye abide without the camp seven days: whosoever hath killed any person, and whosoever hath touched any slain, purify both yourselves and your captives on the third day, and on the seventh day. \n [bbe] You yourselves will have to keep outside the tent-circle for seven days, anyone of you who has put any person to death or come near a dead body; and on the third day and on the seventh day make yourselves and your prisoners clean. \n 31:20 [hgb] 也 要 因 一 切 的 衣 服 ， 皮 物 ， 山 羊 毛 织 的 物 ， 和 各 样 的 木 器 ， 洁 净 自 己 。 \n [kjv] And purify all your raiment, and all that is made of skins, and all work of goats\u0027 hair, and all things made of wood. \n [bbe] And every bit of clothing, and anything made of leather or goats\u0027 hair or wood, you are to make clean. \n 31:21 [hgb] 祭 司 以 利 亚 撒 对 打 仗 回 来 的 兵 丁 说 ， 耶 和 华 所 吩 咐 摩 西 律 法 中 的 条 例 乃 是 这 样 ， \n [kjv] And Eleazar the priest said unto the men of war which went to the battle, This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD commanded Moses; \n [bbe] Then Eleazar the priest said to the men of war who had been to the fight, This is the rule of the law which the Lord has given to Moses: \n 31:22 [hgb] 金 ， 银 ， 铜 ， 铁 ， 锡 ， 铅 ， \n [kjv] Only the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin, and the lead, \n [bbe] But gold and silver and brass and iron and tin and lead, \n 31:23 [hgb] 凡 能 见 火 的 ， 你 们 要 叫 它 经 火 就 为 洁 净 ， 然 而 还 要 用 除 污 秽 的 水 洁 净 它 。 凡 不 能 见 火 的 ， 你 们 要 叫 它 过 水 。 \n [kjv] Every thing that may abide the fire, ye shall make it go through the fire, and it shall be clean: nevertheless it shall be purified with the water of separation: and all that abideth not the fire ye shall make go through the water. \n [bbe] And anything which may be heated, is to go through the fire and be made clean; but in addition it is to be put in the water of cleaning: and anything which may not go through the fire is to be put in the water. \n 31:24 [hgb] 第 七 日 ， 你 们 要 洗 衣 服 ， 就 为 洁 净 ， 然 后 可 以 进 营 。 \n [kjv] And ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and ye shall be clean, and afterward ye shall come into the camp. \n [bbe] And on the seventh day, after washing your clothing, you will be clean, and then you may come into the tent-circle. \n 31:25 [hgb] 耶 和 华 晓 谕 摩 西 说 ， \n [kjv] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, \n [bbe] And the Lord said to Moses, \n 31:26 [hgb] 你 和 祭 司 以 利 亚 撒 ， 并 会 众 的 各 族 长 ， 要 计 算 所 掳 来 的 人 口 和 牲 畜 的 总 数 。 \n [kjv] Take the sum of the prey that was taken, both of man and of beast, thou, and Eleazar the priest, and the chief fathers of the congregation: \n [bbe] Get an account of everything which was taken in the war, of man and of beast, you and Eleazar the priest and the heads of families of the people: \n 31:27 [hgb] 把 所 掳 来 的 分 作 两 半 ， 一 半 归 与 出 去 打 仗 的 精 兵 ， 一 半 归 与 全 会 众 。 \n [kjv] And divide the prey into two parts; between them that took the war upon them, who went out to battle, and between all the congregation: \n [bbe] And let division be made of it into two parts, one for the men of war who went out to the fight, and one for all the people: \n 31:28 [hgb] 又 要 从 出 去 打 仗 所 得 的 人 口 ， 牛 ， 驴 ， 羊 群 中 ， 每 五 百 取 一 ， 作 为 贡 物 奉 给 耶 和 华 。 \n [kjv] And levy a tribute unto the Lord of the men of war which went out to battle: one soul of five hundred, both of the persons, and of the beeves, and of the asses, and of the sheep: \n [bbe] And from the men of war who went out let there be offered to the Lord one out of every five hundred, from the persons, and from the oxen and asses and sheep: \n 31:29 [hgb] 从 他 们 一 半 之 中 ， 要 取 出 来 交 给 祭 司 以 利 亚 撒 ， 作 为 耶 和 华 的 举 祭 。 \n [kjv] Take it of their half, and give it unto Eleazar the priest, for an heave offering of the LORD. \n [bbe] Take this from their part and give it to Eleazar the priest as an offering to be lifted up to the Lord. \n 31:30 [hgb] 从 以 色 列 人 的 一 半 之 中 ， 就 是 从 人 口 ， 牛 ， 驴 ， 羊 群 ， 各 样 牲 畜 中 ， 每 五 十 取 一 ， 交 给 看 守 耶 和 华 帐 幕 的 利 未 人 。 \n [kjv] And of the children of Israel\u0027s half, thou shalt take one portion of fifty, of the persons, of the beeves, of the asses, and of the flocks, of all manner of beasts, and give them unto the Levites, which keep the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD. \n [bbe] And from the part given to the children of Israel, take one out of every fifty, from the persons, and from the oxen and asses and sheep, and give it to the Levites who have the care of the House of the Lord. \n 31:31 [hgb] 于 是 摩 西 和 祭 司 以 利 亚 撒 照 耶 和 华 所 吩 咐 摩 西 的 行 了 。 \n [kjv] And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the LORD commanded Moses. \n [bbe] So Eleazar and Moses did as the Lord had given orders to Moses. \n 31:32 [hgb] 除 了 兵 丁 所 夺 的 财 物 以 外 ， 所 掳 来 的 ， 羊 六 十 七 万 五 千 只 。 \n [kjv] And the booty, being the rest of the prey which the men of war had caught, was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheep, \n [bbe] Now the beasts taken, in addition to what the fighting-men took for themselves, were six hundred and seventy-five thousand sheep, \n 31:33 [hgb] 牛 七 万 二 千 只 。 \n [kjv] And threescore and twelve thousand beeves, \n [bbe] And seventy-two thousand oxen, \n 31:34 [hgb] 驴 六 万 一 千 匹 。 \n [kjv] And threescore and one thousand asses, \n [bbe] And sixty-one thousand asses; \n 31:35 [hgb] 女 人 共 三 万 二 千 口 ， 都 是 没 有 出 嫁 的 。 \n [kjv] And thirty and two thousand persons in all, of women that had not known man by lying with him. \n [bbe] And thirty-two thousand persons, that is, women who had never had sex relations with a man. \n 31:36 [hgb] 出 去 打 仗 之 人 的 分 ， 就 是 他 们 所 得 的 那 一 半 ， 共 计 羊 三 十 三 万 七 千 五 百 只 ， \n [kjv] And the half, which was the portion of them that went out to war, was in number three hundred thousand and seven and thirty thousand and five hundred sheep: \n [bbe] And the half given as their part to the men who went to the war, was three hundred and thirty-seven thousand, five hundred sheep, \n 31:37 [hgb] 从 其 中 归 耶 和 华 为 贡 物 的 ， 有 六 百 七 十 五 只 。 \n [kjv] And the LORD\u0027s tribute of the sheep was six hundred and threescore and fifteen. \n [bbe] Of which the Lord\u0027s part was six hundred and seventy-five. \n 31:38 [hgb] 牛 三 万 六 千 只 ， 从 其 中 归 耶 和 华 为 贡 物 的 ， 有 七 十 二 只 。 \n [kjv] And the beeves were thirty and six thousand; of which the LORD\u0027s tribute was threescore and twelve. \n [bbe] The number of oxen was thirty-six thousand, of which the Lord\u0027s part was seventy-two; \n 31:39 [hgb] 驴 三 万 零 五 百 匹 ， 从 其 中 归 耶 和 华 为 贡 物 的 ， 有 六 十 一 匹 。 \n [kjv] And the asses were thirty thousand and five hundred; of which the LORD\u0027s tribute was threescore and one. \n [bbe] The number of asses was thirty thousand, five hundred, of which the Lord\u0027s part was sixty-one. \n 31:40 [hgb] 人 一 万 六 千 口 ， 从 其 中 归 耶 和 华 的 ， 有 三 十 二 口 。 \n [kjv] And the persons were sixteen thousand; of which the LORD\u0027s tribute was thirty and two persons. \n [bbe] And the number of persons was sixteen thousand, of which the Lord\u0027s part was thirty-two persons. \n 31:41 [hgb] 摩 西 把 贡 物 ， 就 是 归 与 耶 和 华 的 举 祭 ， 交 给 祭 司 以 利 亚 撒 ， 是 照 耶 和 华 所 吩 咐 摩 西 的 。 \n [kjv] And Moses gave the tribute, which was the LORD\u0027s heave offering, unto Eleazar the priest, as the LORD commanded Moses. \n [bbe] And Moses gave the Lord\u0027s part, lifted up as an offering, to Eleazar the priest, as the Lord had given orders to Moses. \n 31:42 [hgb] 以 色 列 人 所 得 的 那 一 半 ， 就 是 摩 西 从 打 仗 的 人 取 来 分 给 他 们 的 。 \n [kjv] And of the children of Israel\u0027s half, which Moses divided from the men that warred, \n [bbe] And from the half given to the children of Israel, which Moses had kept separate from that given to the fighting-men, \n 31:43 [hgb] （ 会 众 的 那 一 半 有 ， 羊 三 十 三 万 七 千 五 百 只 。 \n [kjv] (Now the half that pertained unto the congregation was three hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and five hundred sheep, \n [bbe] (Now the people\u0027s half was three hundred and thirty-seven thousand, five hundred sheep, \n 31:44 [hgb] 牛 三 万 六 千 只 。 \n [kjv] And thirty and six thousand beeves, \n [bbe] And thirty-six thousand oxen, \n 31:45 [hgb] 驴 三 万 零 五 百 匹 。 \n [kjv] And thirty thousand asses and five hundred, \n [bbe] And thirty thousand, five hundred asses, \n 31:46 [hgb] 人 一 万 六 千 口 。 ） \n [kjv] And sixteen thousand persons;) \n [bbe] And sixteen thousand persons;) \n 31:47 [hgb] 无 论 是 人 口 是 牲 畜 ， 摩 西 每 五 十 取 一 ， 交 给 看 守 耶 和 华 帐 幕 的 利 未 人 ， 是 照 耶 和 华 所 吩 咐 摩 西 的 。 \n [kjv] Even of the children of Israel\u0027s half, Moses took one portion of fifty, both of man and of beast, and gave them unto the Levites, which kept the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses. \n [bbe] Even from the children of Israel\u0027s half, Moses took one out of every fifty, men and beasts, and gave them to the Levites who had the care of the House of the Lord; as the Lord gave orders to Moses. \n 31:48 [hgb] 带 领 千 军 的 各 军 长 ， 就 是 千 夫 长 ， 百 夫 长 ， 都 近 前 来 见 摩 西 ， \n [kjv] And the officers which were over thousands of the host, the captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, came near unto Moses: \n [bbe] Then the men in authority over the thousands of the army, the captains of thousands and captains of hundreds, came to Moses, \n 31:49 [hgb] 对 他 说 ， 仆 人 权 下 的 兵 已 经 计 算 总 数 ， 并 不 短 少 一 人 。 \n [kjv] And they said unto Moses, Thy servants have taken the sum of the men of war which are under our charge, and there lacketh not one man of us. \n [bbe] And said to him, Your servants have taken note of the number of all the fighting-men under our orders, and every one is present; \n 31:50 [hgb] 如 今 我 们 将 各 人 所 得 的 金 器 ， 就 是 脚 链 子 ， 镯 子 ， 打 印 的 戒 指 ， 耳 环 ， 手 钏 ， 都 送 来 为 耶 和 华 的 供 物 ， 好 在 耶 和 华 面 前 为 我 们 的 生 命 赎 罪 。 \n [kjv] We have therefore brought an oblation for the LORD, what every man hath gotten, of jewels of gold, chains, and bracelets, rings, earrings, and tablets, to make an atonement for our souls before the LORD. \n [bbe] And we have here an offering for the Lord from what every man took in the war, ornaments of gold, leg-chains and arm-rings, finger-rings, ear-rings, and neck-ornaments, to make our souls free from sin before the Lord. \n 31:51 [hgb] 摩 西 和 祭 司 以 利 亚 撒 就 收 了 他 们 的 金 子 ， 都 是 打 成 的 器 皿 。 \n [kjv] And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them, even all wrought jewels. \n [bbe] So Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold from them, even all the worked ornaments. \n 31:52 [hgb] 千 夫 长 ， 百 夫 长 所 献 给 耶 和 华 为 举 祭 的 金 子 共 有 一 万 六 千 七 百 五 十 舍 客 勒 。 \n [kjv] And all the gold of the offering that they offered up to the LORD, of the captains of thousands, and of the captains of hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels. \n [bbe] And the gold which the captains of thousands and captains of hundreds gave, as an offering to be lifted up before the Lord, came to sixteen thousand, seven hundred and fifty shekels. \n 31:53 [hgb] 各 兵 丁 都 为 自 己 夺 了 财 物 。 \n [kjv] (For the men of war had taken spoil, every man for himself.) \n [bbe] (For every man of the army had taken goods for himself in the war.) \n 31:54 [hgb] 摩 西 和 祭 司 以 利 亚 撒 收 了 千 夫 长 ， 百 夫 长 的 金 子 ， 就 带 进 会 幕 ， 在 耶 和 华 面 前 作 为 以 色 列 人 的 纪 念 。 \n [kjv] And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tabernacle of the congregation, for a memorial for the children of Israel before the LORD. \n [bbe] Then Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold given by the captains of thousands and captains of hundreds, and took it into the Tent of meeting, to be a sign in memory of the children of Israel before the Lord. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/20/484.html","bookId":240,"book":{"id":240,"title":"Numbers民数记（双语小说）","description":"简介： And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the tabernacle of the congregation, on the first day of the second month, in the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying； Take ye the sum of all the ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/20","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:53 AM"}}
