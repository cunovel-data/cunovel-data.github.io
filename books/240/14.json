{"id":7330,"no":14,"title":"Chapter 14","content":"14:1 [hgb] 当 下 ， 全 会 众 大 声 喧 嚷 。 那 夜 百 姓 都 哭 号 。 [kjv] And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night. [bbe] Then all the people gave load cries of grief, and all that night they gave themselves up to weeping. 14:2 [hgb] 以 色 列 众 人 向 摩 西 ， 亚 伦 发 怨 言 。 全 会 众 对 他 们 说 ， 巴 不 得 我 们 早 死 在 埃 及 地 ， 或 是 死 在 这 旷 野 。 [kjv] And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron: and the whole congregation said unto them, Would God that we had died in the land of Egypt! or would God we had died in this wilderness! [bbe] And all the children of Israel, crying out against Moses and Aaron, said, If only we had come to our death in the land of Egypt, or even in this waste land! 14:3 [hgb] 耶 和 华 为 什 么 把 我 们 领 到 那 地 ， 使 我 们 倒 在 刀 下 呢 ？ 我 们 的 妻 子 和 孩 子 必 被 掳 掠 。 我 们 回 埃 及 去 岂 不 好 吗 ？ [kjv] And wherefore hath the LORD brought us unto this land, to fall by the sword, that our wives and our children should be a prey? were it not better for us to return into Egypt? [bbe] Why is the Lord taking us into this land to come to our death by the sword? Our wives and our little ones will get into strange hands: would it not be better for us to go back to Egypt? 14:4 [hgb] 众 人 彼 此 说 ， 我 们 不 如 立 一 个 首 领 回 埃 及 去 吧 。 [kjv] And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt. [bbe] And they said to one another, Let us make a captain over us, and go back to Egypt. 14:5 [hgb] 摩 西 ， 亚 伦 就 俯 伏 在 以 色 列 全 会 众 面 前 。 [kjv] Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel. [bbe] Then Moses and Aaron went down on their faces before the meeting of the people. 14:6 [hgb] 窥 探 地 的 人 中 ， 嫩 的 儿 子 约 书 亚 和 耶 孚 尼 的 儿 子 迦 勒 撕 裂 衣 服 ， [kjv] And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which were of them that searched the land, rent their clothes: [bbe] And Joshua, the son of Nun, and Caleb, the son of Jephunneh, two of those who had been to see the land, giving signs of grief, 14:7 [hgb] 对 以 色 列 全 会 众 说 ， 我 们 所 窥 探 ， 经 过 之 地 是 极 美 之 地 。 [kjv] And they spake unto all the company of the children of Israel, saying, The land, which we passed through to search it, is an exceeding good land. [bbe] Said to all the children of Israel, This land which we went through to see is a very good land. 14:8 [hgb] 耶 和 华 若 喜 悦 我 们 ， 就 必 将 我 们 领 进 那 地 ， 把 地 赐 给 我 们 。 那 地 原 是 流 奶 与 蜜 之 地 。 [kjv] If the LORD delight in us, then he will bring us into this land, and give it us; a land which floweth with milk and honey. [bbe] And if the Lord has delight in us, he will take us into this land and give it to us, a land flowing with milk and honey. 14:9 [hgb] 但 你 们 不 可 背 叛 耶 和 华 ， 也 不 要 怕 那 地 的 居 民 。 因 为 他 们 是 我 们 的 食 物 ， 并 且 荫 庇 他 们 的 已 经 离 开 他 们 。 有 耶 和 华 与 我 们 同 在 ， 不 要 怕 他 们 。 [kjv] Only rebel not ye against the LORD, neither fear ye the people of the land; for they are bread for us: their defence is departed from them, and the LORD is with us: fear them not. [bbe] Only, do not go against the Lord or go in fear of the people of the land, for they will be our food; their strength has been taken from them and the Lord is with us: have no fear of them. 14:10 [hgb] 但 全 会 众 说 ， 拿 石 头 打 死 他 们 二 人 。 忽 然 ， 耶 和 华 的 荣 光 在 会 幕 中 向 以 色 列 众 人 显 现 。 [kjv] But all the congregation bade stone them with stones. And the glory of the LORD appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation before all the children of Israel. [bbe] But all the people said they were to be stoned. Then the glory of the Lord was seen in the Tent of meeting, before the eyes of all the children of Israel. 14:11 [hgb] 耶 和 华 对 摩 西 说 ， 这 百 姓 藐 视 我 要 到 几 时 呢 ？ 我 在 他 们 中 间 行 了 这 一 切 神 迹 ， 他 们 还 不 信 我 要 到 几 时 呢 ？ [kjv] And the LORD said unto Moses, How long will this people provoke me? and how long will it be ere they believe me, for all the signs which I have shewed among them? [bbe] And the Lord said to Moses, How long will this people have no respect for me? how long will they be without faith, in the face of all the signs I have done among them? 14:12 [hgb] 我 要 用 瘟 疫 击 杀 他 们 ， 使 他 们 不 得 承 受 那 地 ， 叫 你 的 后 裔 成 为 大 国 ， 比 他 们 强 胜 。 [kjv] I will smite them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of thee a greater nation and mightier than they. [bbe] I will send disease on them for their destruction, and take away their heritage, and I will make of you a nation greater and stronger than they. 14:13 [hgb] 摩 西 对 耶 和 华 说 ， 埃 及 人 必 听 见 这 事 。 因 为 你 曾 施 展 大 能 ， 将 这 百 姓 从 他 们 中 间 领 上 来 。 [kjv] And Moses said unto the LORD, Then the Egyptians shall hear it, (for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them;) [bbe] And Moses said to the Lord, Then it will come to the ears of the Egyptians; for by your power you took this people out from among them; 14:14 [hgb] 埃 及 人 要 将 这 事 传 给 迦 南 地 的 居 民 。 那 民 已 经 听 见 你 耶 和 华 是 在 这 百 姓 中 间 。 因 为 你 面 对 面 被 人 看 见 ， 有 你 的 云 彩 停 在 他 们 以 上 。 你 日 间 在 云 柱 中 ， 夜 间 在 火 柱 中 ， 在 他 们 前 面 行 。 [kjv] And they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land: for they have heard that thou LORD art among this people, that thou LORD art seen face to face, and that thy cloud standeth over them, and that thou goest before them, by day time in a pillar of a cloud, and in a pillar of fire by night. [bbe] And they will give the news to the people of this land: they have had word that you, Lord, are present with this people, letting yourself be seen face to face, and that your cloud is resting over them, and that you go before them in a pillar of cloud by day and in a pillar of fire by night. 14:15 [hgb] 如 今 你 若 把 这 百 姓 杀 了 ， 如 杀 一 人 ， 那 些 听 见 你 名 声 的 列 邦 必 议 论 说 ， [kjv] Now if thou shalt kill all this people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak, saying, [bbe] Now if you put to death all this people as one man, then the nations who have had word of your glory will say, 14:16 [hgb] 耶 和 华 因 为 不 能 把 这 百 姓 领 进 他 向 他 们 起 誓 应 许 之 地 ， 所 以 在 旷 野 把 他 们 杀 了 。 [kjv] Because the LORD was not able to bring this people into the land which he sware unto them, therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness. [bbe] Because the Lord was not able to take this people into the land which he made an oath to give them, he sent destruction on them in the waste land. 14:17 [hgb] 现 在 求 主 大 显 能 力 ， 照 你 所 说 过 的 话 说 ， [kjv] And now, I beseech thee, let the power of my LORD be great, according as thou hast spoken, saying, [bbe] So now, may my prayer come before you, and let the power of the Lord be great, as you said: 14:18 [hgb] 耶 和 华 不 轻 易 发 怒 ， 并 有 丰 盛 的 慈 爱 ， 赦 免 罪 孽 和 过 犯 。 万 不 以 有 罪 的 为 无 罪 ， 必 追 讨 他 的 罪 ， 自 父 及 子 ， 直 到 三 ， 四 代 。 [kjv] The LORD is longsuffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgression, and by no means clearing the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation. [bbe] The Lord is slow to wrath and great in mercy, overlooking wrongdoing and evil, and will not let wrongdoers go free; sending punishment on children for the sins of their fathers, to the third and fourth generation. 14:19 [hgb] 求 你 照 你 的 大 慈 爱 赦 免 这 百 姓 的 罪 孽 ， 好 象 你 从 埃 及 到 如 今 常 赦 免 他 们 一 样 。 [kjv] Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of thy mercy, and as thou hast forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now. [bbe] May the sin of this people have forgiveness, in the measure of your great mercy, as you have had mercy on them from Egypt up till now. 14:20 [hgb] 耶 和 华 说 ， 我 照 着 你 的 话 赦 免 了 他 们 。 [kjv] And the LORD said, I have pardoned according to thy word: [bbe] And the Lord said, I have had mercy, as you say: 14:21 [hgb] 然 我 指 着 我 的 永 生 起 誓 ， 遍 地 要 被 我 的 荣 耀 充 满 。 [kjv] But as truly as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the LORD. [bbe] But truly, as I am living, and as all the earth will be full of the glory of the Lord; 14:22 [hgb] 这 些 人 虽 看 见 我 的 荣 耀 和 我 在 埃 及 与 旷 野 所 行 的 神 迹 ， 仍 然 试 探 我 这 十 次 ， 不 听 从 我 的 话 ， [kjv] Because all those men which have seen my glory, and my miracles, which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tempted me now these ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice; [bbe] Because all these men, having seen my glory and the signs which I have done in Egypt and in the waste land, still have put me to the test ten times, and have not given ear to my voice; 14:23 [hgb] 他 们 断 不 得 看 见 我 向 他 们 的 祖 宗 所 起 誓 应 许 之 地 。 凡 藐 视 我 的 ， 一 个 也 不 得 看 见 。 [kjv] Surely they shall not see the land which I sware unto their fathers, neither shall any of them that provoked me see it: [bbe] They will not see the land about which I made an oath to their fathers; not one of these by whom I have not been honoured will see it. 14:24 [hgb] 惟 独 我 的 仆 人 迦 勒 ， 因 他 另 有 一 个 心 志 ， 专 一 跟 从 我 ， 我 就 把 他 领 进 他 所 去 过 的 那 地 。 他 的 后 裔 也 必 得 那 地 为 业 。 [kjv] But my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and hath followed me fully, him will I bring into the land whereinto he went; and his seed shall possess it. [bbe] But my servant Caleb, because he had a different spirit in him, and has been true to me with all his heart, him I will take into that land into which he went, and his seed will have it for their heritage. 14:25 [hgb] 亚 玛 力 人 和 迦 南 人 住 在 谷 中 ， 明 天 你 们 要 转 回 ， 从 红 海 的 路 往 旷 野 去 。 [kjv] (Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley.) Tomorrow turn you, and get you into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea. [bbe] Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites are in the valley; tomorrow, turning round, go into the waste land by the way to the Red Sea. 14:26 [hgb] 耶 和 华 对 摩 西 ， 亚 伦 说 ， [kjv] And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, [bbe] Then the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, 14:27 [hgb] 这 恶 会 众 向 我 发 怨 言 ， 我 忍 耐 他 们 要 到 几 时 呢 ？ 以 色 列 人 向 我 所 发 的 怨 言 ， 我 都 听 见 了 。 [kjv] How long shall I bear with this evil congregation, which murmur against me? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against me. [bbe] How long am I to put up with this evil people and their outcries against me? The words which they say against me have come to my ears. 14:28 [hgb] 你 们 告 诉 他 们 ， 耶 和 华 说 ， 我 指 着 我 的 永 生 起 誓 ， 我 必 要 照 你 们 达 到 我 耳 中 的 话 待 你 们 。 [kjv] Say unto them, As truly as I live, saith the LORD, as ye have spoken in mine ears, so will I do to you: [bbe] Say to them, By my life, says the Lord, as certainly as your words have come to my ears, so certainly will I do this to you: 14:29 [hgb] 你 们 的 尸 首 必 倒 在 这 旷 野 ， 并 且 你 们 中 间 凡 被 数 点 ， 从 二 十 岁 以 外 ， 向 我 发 怨 言 的 ， [kjv] Your carcases shall fall in this wilderness; and all that were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward, which have murmured against me, [bbe] Your dead bodies will be stretched out in this waste land; and of all your number, all those of twenty years old and over who have been crying out against me, 14:30 [hgb] 必 不 得 进 我 起 誓 应 许 叫 你 们 住 的 那 地 。 惟 有 耶 孚 尼 的 儿 子 迦 勒 和 嫩 的 儿 子 约 书 亚 才 能 进 去 。 [kjv] Doubtless ye shall not come into the land, concerning which I sware to make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun. [bbe] Not one will come into the land which I gave my word you would have for your resting-place, but only Caleb, the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua, the son of Nun. 14:31 [hgb] 但 你 们 的 妇 人 孩 子 ， 就 是 你 们 所 说 ， 要 被 掳 掠 的 ， 我 必 把 他 们 领 进 去 ， 他 们 就 得 知 你 们 所 厌 弃 的 那 地 。 [kjv] But your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, them will I bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have despised. [bbe] And your little ones, whom you said would come into strange hands, I will take in, and they will see the land which you would not have. 14:32 [hgb] 至 于 你 们 ， 你 们 的 尸 首 必 倒 在 这 旷 野 。 [kjv] But as for you, your carcases, they shall fall in this wilderness. [bbe] But as for you, your dead bodies will be stretched in this waste land. 14:33 [hgb] 你 们 的 儿 女 必 在 旷 野 飘 流 四 十 年 ， 担 当 你 们 淫 行 的 罪 ， 直 到 你 们 的 尸 首 在 旷 野 消 灭 。 [kjv] And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years, and bear your whoredoms, until your carcases be wasted in the wilderness. [bbe] And your children will be wanderers in the waste land for forty years, undergoing punishment for your false ways, till your bodies become dust in the waste land. 14:34 [hgb] 按 你 们 窥 探 那 地 的 四 十 日 ， 一 年 顶 一 日 ， 你 们 要 担 当 罪 孽 四 十 年 ， 就 知 道 我 与 你 们 疏 远 了 ， [kjv] After the number of the days in which ye searched the land, even forty days, each day for a year, shall ye bear your iniquities, even forty years, and ye shall know my breach of promise. [bbe] And as you went through the land viewing it for forty days, so for forty years, a year for every day, you will undergo punishment for your wrongdoing, and you will see that I am against you. 14:35 [hgb] 我 耶 和 华 说 过 ， 我 总 要 这 样 待 这 一 切 聚 集 敌 我 的 恶 会 众 。 他 们 必 在 这 旷 野 消 灭 ， 在 这 里 死 亡 。 [kjv] I the LORD have said, I will surely do it unto all this evil congregation, that are gathered together against me: in this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die. [bbe] I the Lord have said it, and this I will certainly do to all this evil people who have come together against me: in this waste land destruction will come on them, and death will be their fate. 14:36 [hgb] 摩 西 所 打 发 ， 窥 探 那 地 的 人 回 来 ， 报 那 地 的 恶 信 ， 叫 全 会 众 向 摩 西 发 怨 言 ， [kjv] And the men, which Moses sent to search the land, who returned, and made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing up a slander upon the land, [bbe] And the men whom Moses sent to see the land, and who, by the bad account they gave of the land, were the cause of the outcry the people made against Moses, 14:37 [hgb] 这 些 报 恶 信 的 人 都 遭 瘟 疫 ， 死 在 耶 和 华 面 前 。 [kjv] Even those men that did bring up the evil report upon the land, died by the plague before the LORD. [bbe] Those same men who said evil of the land, came to their death by disease before the Lord. 14:38 [hgb] 其 中 惟 有 嫩 的 儿 子 约 书 亚 和 耶 孚 尼 的 儿 子 迦 勒 仍 然 存 活 。 [kjv] But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which were of the men that went to search the land, lived still. [bbe] But Joshua, the son of Nun, and Caleb, the son of Jephunneh, of those who went to see the land, were not touched by disease. 14:39 [hgb] 摩 西 将 这 些 话 告 诉 以 色 列 众 人 ， 他 们 就 甚 悲 哀 。 [kjv] And Moses told these sayings unto all the children of Israel: and the people mourned greatly. [bbe] And when Moses put these words before the children of Israel, the people were full of grief. 14:40 [hgb] 清 早 起 来 ， 上 山 顶 去 ， 说 ， 我 们 在 这 里 ， 我 们 有 罪 了 。 情 愿 上 耶 和 华 所 应 许 的 地 方 去 。 [kjv] And they rose up early in the morning, and gat them up into the top of the mountain, saying, Lo, we be here, and will go up unto the place which the LORD hath promised: for we have sinned. [bbe] And early in the morning they got up and went to the top of the mountain, saying, We are here and we will go up to the place which the Lord said he would give us: for we have done wrong. 14:41 [hgb] 摩 西 说 ， 你 们 为 何 违 背 耶 和 华 的 命 令 呢 ？ 这 事 不 能 顺 利 了 。 [kjv] And Moses said, Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment of the LORD? but it shall not prosper. [bbe] And Moses said, Why are you now acting against the Lord\u0027s order, seeing that no good will come of it? 14:42 [hgb] 不 要 上 去 。 因 为 耶 和 华 不 在 你 们 中 间 ， 恐 怕 你 们 被 仇 敌 杀 败 了 。 [kjv] Go not up, for the LORD is not among you; that ye be not smitten before your enemies. [bbe] Go not up, for the Lord is not with you, and you will be overcome by those who are fighting against you. 14:43 [hgb] 亚 玛 力 人 和 迦 南 人 都 在 你 们 面 前 ， 你 们 必 倒 在 刀 下 。 因 你 们 退 回 不 跟 从 耶 和 华 ， 所 以 他 必 不 与 你 们 同 在 。 [kjv] For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you, and ye shall fall by the sword: because ye are turned away from the LORD, therefore the LORD will not be with you. [bbe] For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you, and you will be put to death by their swords: because you have gone back from the way of the Lord, the Lord will not be with you. 14:44 [hgb] 他 们 却 擅 敢 上 山 顶 去 ， 然 而 耶 和 华 的 约 柜 和 摩 西 没 有 出 营 。 [kjv] But they presumed to go up unto the hill top: nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and Moses, departed not out of the camp. [bbe] But they gave no attention to his words and went to the top of the mountain, though Moses and the ark of the Lord\u0027s agreement did not go out of the tent-circle. 14:45 [hgb] 于 是 亚 玛 力 人 和 住 在 那 山 上 的 迦 南 人 都 下 来 击 打 他 们 ， 把 他 们 杀 退 了 ， 直 到 何 珥 玛 。 [kjv] Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites which dwelt in that hill, and smote them, and discomfited them, even unto Hormah. [bbe] Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites who were living in the hill-country, and overcame them completely, driving them back as far as Hormah.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/20/467.html","bookId":240,"book":{"id":240,"title":"Numbers民数记（双语小说）","description":"简介： And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the tabernacle of the congregation, on the first day of the second month, in the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying； Take ye the sum of all the ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/20","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:53 AM"}}
