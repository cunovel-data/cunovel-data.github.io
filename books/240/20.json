{"id":7336,"no":20,"title":"Chapter 20","content":"20:1 [hgb] 正 月 间 ， 以 色 列 全 会 众 到 了 寻 的 旷 野 ， 就 住 在 加 低 斯 。 米 利 暗 死 在 那 里 ， 就 葬 在 那 里 。 [kjv] Then came the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, into the desert of Zin in the first month: and the people abode in Kadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there. [bbe] In the first month all the children of Israel came into the waste land of Zin, and put up their tents in Kadesh; there death came to Miriam, and they put her body to rest in the earth. 20:2 [hgb] 会 众 没 有 水 喝 ， 就 聚 集 攻 击 摩 西 ， 亚 伦 。 [kjv] And there was no water for the congregation: and they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron. [bbe] And there was no water for the people: and they came together against Moses and against Aaron. 20:3 [hgb] 百 姓 向 摩 西 争 闹 说 ， 我 们 的 弟 兄 曾 死 在 耶 和 华 面 前 ， 我 们 恨 不 得 与 他 们 同 死 。 [kjv] And the people chode with Moses, and spake, saying, Would God that we had died when our brethren died before the LORD! [bbe] And the people were angry with Moses and said, If only death had overtaken us when our brothers came to their death before the Lord! 20:4 [hgb] 你 们 为 何 把 耶 和 华 的 会 众 领 到 这 旷 野 ， 使 我 们 和 牲 畜 都 死 在 这 里 呢 ？ [kjv] And why have ye brought up the congregation of the LORD into this wilderness, that we and our cattle should die there? [bbe] Why have you taken the Lord\u0027s people into this waste, for death to come to us and to our cattle there? 20:5 [hgb] 你 们 为 何 逼 着 我 们 出 埃 及 ， 领 我 们 到 这 坏 地 方 呢 ？ 这 地 方 不 好 撒 种 ， 也 没 有 无 花 果 树 ， 葡 萄 树 ， 石 榴 树 ， 又 没 有 水 喝 。 [kjv] And wherefore have ye made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us in unto this evil place? it is no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither is there any water to drink. [bbe] Why have you made us come out of Egypt into this evil place? This is no place of seed or figs or vines or other fruits, and there is no water for drinking. 20:6 [hgb] 摩 西 ， 亚 伦 离 开 会 众 ， 到 会 幕 门 口 ， 俯 伏 在 地 。 耶 和 华 的 荣 光 向 他 们 显 现 。 [kjv] And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they fell upon their faces: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto them. [bbe] Then Moses and Aaron went away from the people to the door of the Tent of meeting; and, falling on their faces there, they saw the glory of the Lord. 20:7 [hgb] 耶 和 华 晓 谕 摩 西 说 ， [kjv] And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying, [bbe] And the Lord said to Moses, 20:8 [hgb] 你 拿 着 杖 去 ， 和 你 的 哥 哥 亚 伦 招 聚 会 众 ， 在 他 们 眼 前 吩 咐 磐 石 发 出 水 来 ， 水 就 从 磐 石 流 出 ， 给 会 众 和 他 们 的 牲 畜 喝 。 [kjv] Take the rod, and gather thou the assembly together, thou, and Aaron thy brother, and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes; and it shall give forth his water, and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock: so thou shalt give the congregation and their beasts drink. [bbe] Take the rod, you and Aaron, your brother, and make all the people come together, and before their eyes give orders to the rock to give out its water; and so make water come out of the rock for them, and give the people and their cattle drink. 20:9 [hgb] 于 是 摩 西 照 耶 和 华 所 吩 咐 的 ， 从 耶 和 华 面 前 取 了 杖 去 。 [kjv] And Moses took the rod from before the LORD, as he commanded him. [bbe] And Moses took the rod from before the Lord as he gave him orders. 20:10 [hgb] 摩 西 ， 亚 伦 就 招 聚 会 众 到 磐 石 前 。 摩 西 说 ， 你 们 这 些 背 叛 的 人 听 我 说 ， 我 为 你 们 使 水 从 这 磐 石 中 流 出 来 吗 ？ [kjv] And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the rock, and he said unto them, Hear now, ye rebels; must we fetch you water out of this rock? [bbe] Then Moses and Aaron made the people come together in front of the rock, and he said to them, Give ear now, you people whose hearts are turned from the Lord; are we to get water for you out of the rock? 20:11 [hgb] 摩 西 举 手 ， 用 杖 击 打 磐 石 两 下 ， 就 有 许 多 水 流 出 来 ， 会 众 和 他 们 的 牲 畜 都 喝 了 。 [kjv] And Moses lifted up his hand, and with his rod he smote the rock twice: and the water came out abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their beasts also. [bbe] And lifting up his hand, Moses gave the rock two blows with his rod: and water came streaming out, and the people and their cattle had drink enough. 20:12 [hgb] 耶 和 华 对 摩 西 ， 亚 伦 说 ， 因 为 你 们 不 信 我 ， 不 在 以 色 列 人 眼 前 尊 我 为 圣 ， 所 以 你 们 必 不 得 领 这 会 众 进 我 所 赐 给 他 们 的 地 去 。 [kjv] And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye believed me not, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them. [bbe] Then the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, Because you had not enough faith in me to keep my name holy before the children of Israel, you will not take this people into the land which I have given them. 20:13 [hgb] 这 水 名 叫 米 利 巴 水 （ 米 利 巴 就 是 争 闹 的 意 思 ） ， 是 因 以 色 列 人 向 耶 和 华 争 闹 ， 耶 和 华 就 在 他 们 面 前 显 为 圣 。 [kjv] This is the water of Meribah; because the children of Israel strove with the LORD, and he was sanctified in them. [bbe] These are the waters of Meribah; because the children of Israel went against the Lord, and they saw that he was holy among them. 20:14 [hgb] 摩 西 从 加 低 斯 差 遣 使 者 去 见 以 东 王 ， 说 ， 你 的 弟 兄 以 色 列 人 这 样 说 ， 我 们 所 遭 遇 的 一 切 艰 难 ， [kjv] And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom, Thus saith thy brother Israel, Thou knowest all the travail that hath befallen us: [bbe] Then Moses sent men from Kadesh to the king of Edom to say to him, Your brother Israel says, You have knowledge of all the things we have been through; 20:15 [hgb] 就 是 我 们 的 列 祖 下 到 埃 及 ， 我 们 在 埃 及 久 住 。 埃 及 人 恶 待 我 们 的 列 祖 和 我 们 ， [kjv] How our fathers went down into Egypt, and we have dwelt in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians vexed us, and our fathers: [bbe] How our fathers went down into Egypt, and we were living in Egypt for a long time; and the Egyptians were cruel to us and to our fathers: 20:16 [hgb] 我 们 哀 求 耶 和 华 的 时 候 ， 他 听 了 我 们 的 声 音 ， 差 遣 使 者 把 我 们 从 埃 及 领 出 来 。 这 事 你 都 知 道 。 如 今 ， 我 们 在 你 边 界 上 的 城 加 低 斯 。 [kjv] And when we cried unto the LORD, he heard our voice, and sent an angel, and hath brought us forth out of Egypt: and, behold, we are in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of thy border: [bbe] And the Lord gave ear to the voice of our cry, and sent an angel and took us out of Egypt: and now we are in Kadesh, a town on the edge of your land; 20:17 [hgb] 求 你 容 我 们 从 你 的 地 经 过 。 我 们 不 走 田 间 和 葡 萄 园 ， 也 不 喝 井 里 的 水 ， 只 走 大 道 （ 原 文 作 王 道 ） ， 不 偏 左 右 ， 直 到 过 了 你 的 境 界 。 [kjv] Let us pass, I pray thee, through thy country: we will not pass through the fields, or through the vineyards, neither will we drink of the water of the wells: we will go by the king\u0027s high way, we will not turn to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed thy borders. [bbe] Let us now go through your land: we will not go into field or vine-garden, or take the water of the springs; we will go by the highway, not turning to the right or to the left, till we have gone past the limits of your land. 20:18 [hgb] 以 东 王 说 ， 你 不 可 从 我 的 地 经 过 ， 免 得 我 带 刀 出 去 攻 击 你 。 [kjv] And Edom said unto him, Thou shalt not pass by me, lest I come out against thee with the sword. [bbe] And Edom said, You are not to go through my land, for if you do I will come out against you with the sword. 20:19 [hgb] 以 色 列 人 说 ， 我 们 要 走 大 道 上 去 。 我 们 和 牲 畜 若 喝 你 的 水 ， 必 给 你 价 值 。 不 求 别 的 ， 只 求 你 容 我 们 步 行 过 去 。 [kjv] And the children of Israel said unto him, We will go by the high way: and if I and my cattle drink of thy water, then I will pay for it: I will only, without doing anything else, go through on my feet. [bbe] And the children of Israel said to him, We will go up by the highway: and if we or our cattle take of your water, we will give you a price for it: only let us go through on our feet, nothing more. 20:20 [hgb] 以 东 王 说 ， 你 们 不 可 经 过 。 就 率 领 许 多 人 出 来 ， 要 用 强 硬 的 手 攻 击 以 色 列 人 。 [kjv] And he said, Thou shalt not go through. And Edom came out against him with much people, and with a strong hand. [bbe] But he said, You are not to go through. And Edom came out against them in his strength, with a great army. 20:21 [hgb] 这 样 ， 以 东 王 不 肯 容 以 色 列 人 从 他 的 境 界 过 去 。 于 是 他 们 转 去 ， 离 开 他 。 [kjv] Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border: wherefore Israel turned away from him. [bbe] So Edom would not let Israel go through his land; and Israel went in another direction. 20:22 [hgb] 以 色 列 全 会 众 从 加 低 斯 起 行 ， 到 了 何 珥 山 。 [kjv] And the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, journeyed from Kadesh, and came unto mount Hor. [bbe] And they went on from Kadesh, and came, with all their people, to Mount Hor. 20:23 [hgb] 耶 和 华 在 附 近 以 东 边 界 的 何 珥 山 上 晓 谕 摩 西 ， 亚 伦 说 ， [kjv] And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, by the coast of the land of Edom, saying, [bbe] And at Mount Hor, at the edge of the land of Edom, the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, 20:24 [hgb] 亚 伦 要 归 到 他 列 祖 （ 原 文 作 本 民 ） 那 里 。 他 必 不 得 入 我 所 赐 给 以 色 列 人 的 地 。 因 为 在 米 利 巴 水 ， 你 们 违 背 了 我 的 命 。 [kjv] Aaron shall be gathered unto his people: for he shall not enter into the land which I have given unto the children of Israel, because ye rebelled against my word at the water of Meribah. [bbe] Aaron will be put to rest with his people; he will not go into the land which I have given to the children of Israel, because you went against my word at the waters of Meribah. 20:25 [hgb] 你 带 亚 伦 和 他 的 儿 子 以 利 亚 撒 上 何 珥 山 ， [kjv] Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up unto mount Hor: [bbe] So take Aaron and Eleazar, his son, up into Mount Hor; 20:26 [hgb] 把 亚 伦 的 圣 衣 脱 下 来 ， 给 他 的 儿 子 以 利 亚 撒 穿 上 。 亚 伦 必 死 在 那 里 ， 归 他 列 祖 。 [kjv] And strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son: and Aaron shall be gathered unto his people, and shall die there. [bbe] And take Aaron\u0027s robes off him and put them on Eleazar, his son: and death will come to Aaron there, and he will be put to rest with his people. 20:27 [hgb] 摩 西 就 照 耶 和 华 所 吩 咐 的 行 。 三 人 当 着 会 众 的 眼 前 上 了 何 珥 山 。 [kjv] And Moses did as the LORD commanded: and they went up into mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation. [bbe] So Moses did as the Lord had said, and before the eyes of all the people they went up Mount Hor. 20:28 [hgb] 摩 西 把 亚 伦 的 圣 衣 脱 下 来 ， 给 他 的 儿 子 以 利 亚 撒 穿 上 ， 亚 伦 就 死 在 山 顶 那 里 。 于 是 摩 西 和 以 利 亚 撒 下 了 山 。 [kjv] And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there in the top of the mount: and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mount. [bbe] And Moses took off Aaron\u0027s robes, and put them on Eleazar, his son; and there on the top of the mountain death came to Aaron: then Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain. 20:29 [hgb] 全 会 众 ， 就 是 以 色 列 全 家 ， 见 亚 伦 已 经 死 了 ， 便 都 为 亚 伦 哀 哭 了 三 十 天 。 [kjv] And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they mourned for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel. [bbe] And when the people saw that Aaron was dead, all the children of Israel gave themselves up to weeping for him for thirty days.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/20/473.html","bookId":240,"book":{"id":240,"title":"Numbers民数记（双语小说）","description":"简介： And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the tabernacle of the congregation, on the first day of the second month, in the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying； Take ye the sum of all the ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/20","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:53 AM"}}
