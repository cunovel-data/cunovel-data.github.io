{"id":7335,"no":19,"title":"Chapter 19","content":"19:1 [hgb] 耶 和 华 晓 谕 摩 西 ， 亚 伦 说 ， [kjv] And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying, [bbe] And the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, 19:2 [hgb] 耶 和 华 命 定 律 法 中 的 一 条 律 例 乃 是 这 样 说 ， 你 要 吩 咐 以 色 列 人 ， 把 一 只 没 有 残 疾 ， 未 曾 负 轭 ， 纯 红 的 母 牛 牵 到 你 这 里 来 ， [kjv] This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD hath commanded, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring thee a red heifer without spot, wherein is no blemish, and upon which never came yoke: [bbe] This is the rule of the law which the Lord has made, saying, Give orders to the children of Israel to give you a red cow without any mark on her, and on which the yoke has never been put: 19:3 [hgb] 交 给 祭 司 以 利 亚 撒 。 他 必 牵 到 营 外 ， 人 就 把 牛 宰 在 他 面 前 。 [kjv] And ye shall give her unto Eleazar the priest, that he may bring her forth without the camp, and one shall slay her before his face: [bbe] Give her to Eleazar the priest and let him take her outside the tent-circle and have her put to death before him. 19:4 [hgb] 祭 司 以 利 亚 撒 要 用 指 头 蘸 这 牛 的 血 ， 向 会 幕 前 面 弹 七 次 。 [kjv] And Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger, and sprinkle of her blood directly before the tabernacle of the congregation seven times: [bbe] Then let Eleazar the priest take some of her blood on his finger, shaking the blood seven times in the direction of the front of the Tent of meeting: 19:5 [hgb] 人 要 在 他 眼 前 把 这 母 牛 焚 烧 。 牛 的 皮 ， 肉 ， 血 ， 粪 都 要 焚 烧 。 [kjv] And one shall burn the heifer in his sight; her skin, and her flesh, and her blood, with her dung, shall he burn: [bbe] And the cow is to be burned before him, her skin and her flesh and her blood and her waste are to be burned: 19:6 [hgb] 祭 司 要 把 香 柏 木 ， 牛 膝 草 ， 朱 红 色 线 都 丢 在 烧 牛 的 火 中 。 [kjv] And the priest shall take cedar wood, and hyssop, and scarlet, and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer. [bbe] Then let the priest take cedar-wood and hyssop and red thread, and put them into the fire where the cow is burning. 19:7 [hgb] 祭 司 必 不 洁 净 到 晚 上 ， 要 洗 衣 服 ， 用 水 洗 身 ， 然 后 可 以 进 营 。 [kjv] Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp, and the priest shall be unclean until the even. [bbe] And the priest, after washing his clothing and bathing his body in water, may come back to the tent-circle, and will be unclean till evening. 19:8 [hgb] 烧 牛 的 人 必 不 洁 净 到 晚 上 ， 也 要 洗 衣 服 ， 用 水 洗 身 。 [kjv] And he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water, and bathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the even. [bbe] And he who does the burning is to have his clothing washed and his body bathed in water and be unclean till evening. 19:9 [hgb] 必 有 一 个 洁 净 的 人 收 起 母 牛 的 灰 ， 存 在 营 外 洁 净 的 地 方 ， 为 以 色 列 会 众 调 作 除 污 秽 的 水 。 这 本 是 除 罪 的 。 [kjv] And a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and lay them up without the camp in a clean place, and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel for a water of separation: it is a purification for sin. [bbe] Then let a man who is clean take the dust of the burned cow and put it outside the tent-circle in a clean place, where it is to be kept for the children of Israel and used in making the water which takes away what is unclean: it is a sin-offering. 19:10 [hgb] 收 起 母 牛 灰 的 人 必 不 洁 净 到 晚 上 ， 要 洗 衣 服 。 这 要 给 以 色 列 人 和 寄 居 在 他 们 中 间 的 外 人 作 为 永 远 的 定 例 。 [kjv] And he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the even: and it shall be unto the children of Israel, and unto the stranger that sojourneth among them, for a statute for ever. [bbe] And he who takes up the dust of the burned cow is to have his clothing washed with water and be unclean till evening: this is to be a law for ever, for the children of Israel as well as for the man from another country who is living among them. 19:11 [hgb] 摸 了 人 死 尸 的 ， 就 必 七 天 不 洁 净 。 [kjv] He that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days. [bbe] Anyone touching a dead body will be unclean for seven days: 19:12 [hgb] 那 人 到 第 三 天 要 用 这 除 污 秽 的 水 洁 净 自 己 ， 第 七 天 就 洁 净 了 。 他 若 在 第 三 天 不 洁 净 自 己 ， 第 七 天 就 不 洁 净 了 。 [kjv] He shall purify himself with it on the third day, and on the seventh day he shall be clean: but if he purify not himself the third day, then the seventh day he shall not be clean. [bbe] On the third day and on the seventh day he is to make himself clean with the water, and so he will be clean: but if he does not do this on the third day and on the seventh day, he will not be clean. 19:13 [hgb] 凡 摸 了 人 死 尸 ， 不 洁 净 自 己 的 ， 就 玷 污 了 耶 和 华 的 帐 幕 ， 这 人 必 从 以 色 列 中 剪 除 。 因 为 那 除 污 秽 的 水 没 有 洒 在 他 身 上 ， 他 就 为 不 洁 净 ， 污 秽 还 在 他 身 上 。 [kjv] Whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead, and purifieth not himself, defileth the tabernacle of the LORD; and that soul shall be cut off from Israel: because the water of separation was not sprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness is yet upon him. [bbe] Anyone touching the body of a dead man without making himself clean in this way, makes the House of the Lord unclean; and that man will be cut off from Israel: because the water was not put on him, he will be unclean; his unclean condition is unchanged. 19:14 [hgb] 人 死 在 帐 棚 里 的 条 例 乃 是 这 样 ， 凡 进 那 帐 棚 的 ， 和 一 切 在 帐 棚 里 的 ， 都 必 七 天 不 洁 净 。 [kjv] This is the law, when a man dieth in a tent: all that come into the tent, and all that is in the tent, shall be unclean seven days. [bbe] This is the law when death comes to a man in his tent: everyone who comes into the tent, and everyone who is in the tent, will be unclean for seven days. 19:15 [hgb] 凡 敞 口 的 器 皿 ， 就 是 没 有 扎 上 盖 的 ， 也 是 不 洁 净 。 [kjv] And every open vessel, which hath no covering bound upon it, is unclean. [bbe] And every open vessel without a cover fixed on it will be unclean. 19:16 [hgb] 无 论 何 人 在 田 野 里 摸 了 被 刀 杀 的 ， 或 是 尸 首 ， 或 是 人 的 骨 头 ， 或 是 坟 墓 ， 就 要 七 天 不 洁 净 。 [kjv] And whosoever toucheth one that is slain with a sword in the open fields, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be unclean seven days. [bbe] And anyone touching one who has been put to death with the sword in the open country, or the body of one who has come to his end by a natural death, or a man\u0027s bone, or the resting-place of a dead body, will be unclean for seven days. 19:17 [hgb] 要 为 这 不 洁 净 的 人 拿 些 烧 成 的 除 罪 灰 放 在 器 皿 里 ， 倒 上 活 水 。 [kjv] And for an unclean person they shall take of the ashes of the burnt heifer of purification for sin, and running water shall be put thereto in a vessel: [bbe] And for the unclean, they are to take the dust of the burning of the sin-offering, and put flowing water on it in a vessel: 19:18 [hgb] 必 当 有 一 个 洁 净 的 人 拿 牛 膝 草 蘸 在 这 水 中 ， 把 水 洒 在 帐 棚 上 ， 和 一 切 器 皿 并 帐 棚 内 的 众 人 身 上 ， 又 洒 在 摸 了 骨 头 ， 或 摸 了 被 杀 的 ， 或 摸 了 自 死 的 ， 或 摸 了 坟 墓 的 那 人 身 上 。 [kjv] And a clean person shall take hyssop, and dip it in the water, and sprinkle it upon the tent, and upon all the vessels, and upon the persons that were there, and upon him that touched a bone, or one slain, or one dead, or a grave: [bbe] And a clean person is to take hyssop and put it in the water, shaking it over the tent, and all the vessels, and the people who were there, and over him by whom the bone, or the body of one who has been put to death with the sword, or the body of one who has come to his end by a natural death, or the resting-place was touched. 19:19 [hgb] 第 三 天 和 第 七 天 ， 洁 净 的 人 要 洒 水 在 不 洁 净 的 人 身 上 ， 第 七 天 就 使 他 成 为 洁 净 。 那 人 要 洗 衣 服 ， 用 水 洗 澡 ， 到 晚 上 就 洁 净 了 。 [kjv] And the clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the third day, and on the seventh day: and on the seventh day he shall purify himself, and wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and shall be clean at even. [bbe] Let the clean person do this to the unclean on the third day and on the seventh day: and on the seventh day he is to make him clean; and after washing his clothing and bathing himself in water, he will be clean in the evening. 19:20 [hgb] 但 那 污 秽 而 不 洁 净 自 己 的 ， 要 将 他 从 会 中 剪 除 ， 因 为 他 玷 污 了 耶 和 华 的 圣 所 。 除 污 秽 的 水 没 有 洒 在 他 身 上 ， 他 是 不 洁 净 的 。 [kjv] But the man that shall be unclean, and shall not purify himself, that soul shall be cut off from among the congregation, because he hath defiled the sanctuary of the LORD: the water of separation hath not been sprinkled upon him; he is unclean. [bbe] But the man who, being unclean, does not make himself clean in this way, will be cut off from the meeting of the people, because he has made the holy place of the Lord unclean: the water has not been put on him, he is unclean. 19:21 [hgb] 这 要 给 你 们 作 为 永 远 的 定 例 。 并 且 那 洒 除 污 秽 水 的 人 要 洗 衣 服 。 凡 摸 除 污 秽 水 的 ， 必 不 洁 净 到 晚 上 。 [kjv] And it shall be a perpetual statute unto them, that he that sprinkleth the water of separation shall wash his clothes; and he that toucheth the water of separation shall be unclean until even. [bbe] This is to be a law for them for ever: he who puts the water on the unclean person is to have his clothing washed; and anyone touching the water will be unclean till evening. 19:22 [hgb] 不 洁 净 人 所 摸 的 一 切 物 就 不 洁 净 。 摸 了 这 物 的 人 必 不 洁 净 到 晚 上 。 [kjv] And whatsoever the unclean person toucheth shall be unclean; and the soul that toucheth it shall be unclean until even. [bbe] Anything touched by the unclean person will be unclean; and any person touching it will be unclean till evening.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/20/472.html","bookId":240,"book":{"id":240,"title":"Numbers民数记（双语小说）","description":"简介： And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the tabernacle of the congregation, on the first day of the second month, in the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying； Take ye the sum of all the ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/zongjiao/20","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:25 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:53 AM"}}
