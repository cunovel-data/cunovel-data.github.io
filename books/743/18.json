{"id":11271,"no":18,"title":"Chapter 18 The Return Journey","content":"When Bilbo came to himself, he was literally by himself. He was lying on the flat stones of Ravenhill, and no one was near. A cloudless day, but cold, was broad above him. He was shaking, and as chilled as stone, but his head burned with fire. \"Now I wonder what has happened?\" he said to himself. \"At any rate I am not yet one of the fallen heroes; but I suppose there is still time enough for that!\" He sat up painfully. Looking into the valley he could see no living goblins. After a while as his head cleared a little, he thought he could see elves moving in the rocks below. He rubbed his eyes. Surely there was a camp still in the plain some distance off; and there was a coming and going about the Gate? Dwarves seemed to be busy removing the wall. But all was deadly still. There was no call and no echo of a song. Sorrow seemed to be in the air. \"Victory after all, I suppose!\" he said, feeling his aching head. \"Well, it seems a very gloomy business.\" Suddenly he was aware of a man climbing up and coming towards him. \"Hullo there!\" he called with a shaky voice. \"Hullo there! What news?\" \"What voice is it that speaks among the stones?\" said the man halting and peering about him not far from where Bilbo sat. Then Bilbo remembered his ring! \"Well I\u0027m blessed!\" said he. \"This invisibility has its drawbacks after all. Otherwise I suppose I might have spent a warm and comfortable night in bed!\" \"It\u0027s me, Bilbo Baggins, companion of Thorin!\" he cried, hurriedly taking off the ring. \"It is well that I have found you!\" said the man striding forward. \"You are needed and we have looked for you long. You would have been numbered among the dead, who are many, if Gandalf the wizard had not said that your voice was last heard in this place. I have been sent to look here for the last time. Are you much hurt?\" \"A nasty knock on the head, I think,\" said Bilbo. \"But I have a helm and a hard skull. All the same I feel sick and my legs are like straws.\" \"I will carry you down to the camp in the valley,\" said the man, and picked him lightly up. The man was swift and sure-footed. It was not long before Bilbo was set down before a tent in Dale; and there stood Gandalf, with his arm in a sling. Even the wizard had not escaped without a wound; and there were few unharmed in all the host. When Gandalf saw Bilbo, he was delighted. \"Baggins!\" he exclaimed. \"Well I never! Alive after all — 1 am glad! I began to wonder if even your luck would see you through! A terrible business, and it nearly was disastrous. But other news can wait. Come!\" he said more gravely. \"You are called for;\" and leading the hobbit he took him within the tent. \"Hail! Thorin,\" he said as he entered. \"I have brought him.\" There indeed lay Thorin Oakenshield, wounded with many wounds, and his rent armour and notched axe were cast upon the floor. He looked up as Bilbo came beside him. \"Farewell, good thief,\" he said. \"I go now to the halls of waiting to sit beside my fathers, until the world is renewed. Since I leave now all gold and silver, and go where it is of little worth, I wish to part in friendship from you, and I would take back my words and deeds at the Gate.\" Bilbo knelt on one knee filled with sorrow. \"Farewell, King under the Mountain!\" he said. \"This is a bitter adventure, if it must end so; and not a mountain of gold can amend it. Yet I am glad that I have shared in your perils — that has been more than any Baggins deserves.\" \"No!\" said Thorin. \"There is more in you of good than you know, child of the kindly West. Some courage and some wisdom, blended in measure. If more of us valued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold, it would be a merrier world. But sad or merry, I must leave it now. Farewell!\" Then Bilbo turned away, and he went by himself, and sat alone wrapped in a blanket, and, whether you believe it or not, he wept until his eyes were red and his voice was hoarse. He was a kindly little soul. Indeed it was long before he had the heart to make a joke again. \"A mercy it is,\" he said at last to himself, \"that I woke up when I did. I wish Thorin were living, but I am glad that we parted in kindness. You are a fool, Bilbo Baggins, and you made a great mess of that business with the stone; and there was a battle, in spite of all your efforts to buy peace and quiet, but I suppose you can hardly be blamed for that.\" All that had happened after he was stunned, Bilbo learned later; but it gave him more sorrow than joy, and he was now weary of his adventure. He was aching in his bones for the homeward journey. That, however, was a little delayed, so in the meantime I will tell something of events. The Eagles had long had suspicion of the goblins\u0027 mustering; from their watchfulness the movements in the mountains could not be altogether hid. So they too had gathered in great numbers, under the great Eagle of the Misty Mountains; and at length smelling battle from afar they had come speeding down the gale in the nick of time. They it was who dislodged the goblins from the mountain-slopes, casting them over precipices, or driving them down shrieking and bewildered among their foes. It was not long before they had freed the Lonely Mountain, and elves and men on either side of the valley could come at last to the help of the battle below. But even with the Eagles they were still outnumbered. In that last hour Beorn himself had appeared — no one knew how or from where. He came alone, and in bear\u0027s shape; and he seemed to have grown almost to giant-size in his wrath. The roar of his voice was like drums and guns; and he tossed wolves and goblins from his path like straws and feathers. He fell upon their rear, and broke like a clap of thunder through the ring. The dwarves were making a stand still about their lords upon a low rounded hill. Then Beorn stooped and lifted Thorin, who had fallen pierced with spears, and bore him out of the fray. Swiftly he returned and his wrath was redoubled, so that nothing could withstand him, and no weapon seemed to bite upon him. He scattered the bodyguard, and pulled down Bolg himself and crushed him. Then dismay fell on the Goblins and they fled in all directions. But weariness left their enemies with the coming of new hope, and they pursued them closely, and prevented most of them from escaping where they could. They drove many of them into the Running River, and such as fled south or west they hunted into the marshes about the Forest River; and there the greater part of the last fugitives perished, while those that came hardly to the Wood-elves\u0027 realm were there slain, or drawn in to die in the trackless dark of Mirkwood. Songs have said that three parts of the goblin warriors of the North perished on that day, and the mountains had peace for many a year. Victory had been assured before the fall of night, but the pursuit was still on foot, when Bilbo returned to the camp; and not many were in the valley save the more grievously wounded. \"Where are the Eagles?\" he asked Gandalf that evening, as he lay wrapped in many warm blankets. \"Some are in the hunt,\" said the wizard, \"but most have gone back to their eyries. They would not stay here, and departed with the first light of morning. Dain has crowned their chief with gold, and sworn friendship with them for ever.\" \"I am sorry. I mean, I should have liked to see them again,\" said Bilbo sleepily; \"perhaps I shall see them on the way home. I suppose I shall be going home soon?\" \"As soon as you like,\" said the wizard. Actually it was some days before Bilbo really set out. They buried Thorin deep beneath the Mountain, and Bard laid the Arkenstone upon his breast. \"There let it lie till the Mountain falls!\" he said. \"May it bring good fortune to all his folk that dwell here after!\" Upon his tomb the Elvenking then laid Orcrist, the elvish sword that had been taken from Thorin in captivity. It is said in songs that it gleamed ever in the dark if foes approached, and the fortress of the dwarves could not be taken by surprise. There now Dain son of Nain took up his abode, and he became King under the Mountain, and in time many other dwarves gathered to his throne in the ancient halls. Of the twelve companions of Thorin, ten remained. Fili and Kili had fallen defending him with shield and body, for he was their mother\u0027s elder brother. The others remained with Dain; for Dain dealt his treasure well. There was, of course, no longer any question of dividing the hoard in such shares as had been planned, to Balin and Dwalin, and Dori and Nori and Ori, and Oin and Gloin, and Bifur and Bofur and Bombur-or to Bilbo. Yet a fourteenth share of all the silver and gold, wrought and unwrought, was given up to Bard; for Dain said: \"We will honour the agreement of the dead, and he has now the Arkenstone in his keeping.\" Even a fourteenth share was wealth exceedingly great, greater than that of many mortal kings. From that treasure Bard sent much gold to the Master of Lake-town; and he rewarded his followers and friends freely. To the Elvenking he gave the emeralds of Girion, such jewels as he most loved, which Dain had restored to him. To Bilbo he said: \"This treasure is as much yours as it is mine; though old agreements cannot stand, since so many have a claim in its winning and defence. Yet even though you were willing to lay aside all your claim, I should wish that the words of Thorin, of which he repented, should not prove true: that we should give you little. I would reward you most richly of all.\" \"Very kind of you,\" said Bilbo. \"But really it is a relief to me. How on earth should I have got all that treasure home without war and murder all along the way, I don\u0027t know. And I don\u0027t know what I should have done with it when I got home. I am sure it is better in your hands.\" In the end he would only take two small chests, one filled with silver, and the other with gold, such as one strong pony could carry. \"That will be quite as much as I can manage,\" said he. At last the time came for him to say good-bye to his friends. \"Farewell, Balin!\" he said; \"and farewell, Dwalin; and farewell Dori, Nori, Ori, Oin, Gloin, Bifur, Bofur, and Bombur! May your beards never grow thin!\" And turning towards the Mountain he added: \"Farewell Thorin Oakenshield! And Fili and Kili! May your memory never fade!\" Then the dwarves bowed low before their Gate, but words stuck in their throats. \"Good-bye and good luck, wherever you fare!\" said Balin at last. \"If ever you visit us again, when our halls are made fair once more, then the feast shall indeed be splendid!\" \"If ever you are passing my way,\" said Bilbo, \"don\u0027t wait to knock! Tea is at four; but any of you are welcome at any time!\" Then he turned away. The elf-host was on the march;. and if it was sadly lessened, yet many were glad, for now the northern world would be merrier for many a long day. The dragon was dead, and the goblins overthrown, and their hearts looked forward after winter to a spring of joy. Gandalf and Bilbo rode behind the Elvenking, and beside them strode Beorn, once again in man\u0027s shape, and he laughed and sang in a loud voice upon the road. So they went on until they drew near to the borders of Mirkwood, to the north of the place where the Forest River ran out. Then they halted, for the wizard and Bilbo would not enter the wood, even though the king bade them stay a while in his halls. They intended to go along the edge of the forest, and round its northern end in the waste that lay between it and the beginning of the Grey Mountains. It was a long and cheerless road, but now that the goblins were crushed, it seemed safer to them than the dreadful pathways under the trees. Moreover Beorn was going that way too. \"Farewell! O Elvenking!\" said Gandalf. \"Merry be the greenwood, while the world is yet young! And merry be all your folk!\" \"Farewell! O Gandalf!\" said the king. \"May you ever appear where you are most needed and least expected! The oftener you appear in my halls the better shall I be pleased!\" \"I beg of you,\" said Bilbo stammering and standing on one foot, \"to accept this gift!\" and he brought out a necklace of silver and pearls that Dain had given him at their parting. \"In what way have I earned such a gift, O hobbit?\" said the king. \"Well, er, I thought, don\u0027t you know,\" said Bilbo rather confused, \"that, er, some little return should be made for your, er, hospitality. I mean even a burglar has his feelings. I have drunk much of your wine and eaten much of your bread.\" \"I will take your gift, O Bilbo the Magnificent!\" said the king gravely. \"And I name you elf-friend and blessed. May your shadow never grow less (or stealing would be too easy)! Farewell!\" Then the elves turned towards the Forest, and Bilbo started on his long road home. He had many hardships and adventures before he got back. The Wild was still the Wild, and there were many other things in it in those days besides goblins; but he was well guided and well guarded-the wizard was with him, and Beorn for much of the way-and he was never in great danger again. Anyway by mid-winter Gandalf and Bilbo had come all the way back, along both edges of the Forest, to the doors of Beorn\u0027s house; and there for a while they both stayed. Yule-tide was warm and merry there; and men came from far and wide to feast at Beorn\u0027s bidding. The goblins of the Misty Mountains were now few and terrified, and hidden in the deepest holes they could find; and the Wargs had vanished from the woods, so that men went abroad without fear. Beorn indeed became a great chief afterwards in those regions and ruled a wide land between the mountains and the wood; and it is said that for many generations the men of his line had the power of taking bear\u0027s shape, and some were grim men and bad, but most were in heart like Beorn, if less in size and strength. In their day the last goblins were hunted from the Misty Mountains and a new peace came over the edge of the Wild. It was spring, and a fair one with mild weathers and a bright sun, before Bilbo and Gandalf took their leave at last of Beorn, and though he longed for home. Bilbo left with regret, for the flowers of the gardens of Beorn were m springtime no less marvellous than in high summer. At last they came up the long road, and reached the very pass where the goblins had captured them before. But they came to that high point at morning, and looking backward they saw a white sun shining over the out-stretched lands. There behind lay Mirkwood, blue in the distance, and darkly green at the nearer edge even in the spring. There far away was the Lonely Mountain on the edge of eyesight. On its highest peak snow yet unmelted was gleaming pale. \"So comes snow after fire, and even dragons have their ending!\" said Bilbo, and he turned his back on his adventure. The Tookish part was getting very tired, and the Baggins was daily getting stronger. \"I wish now only to be in my own arm-chair!\" he said. 　 It was on May the First that the two came back at last to the brink of the valley of Rivendell, where stood the Last (or the First) Homely House. Again it was evening, their ponies were tired, especially the one that carried the baggage; and they all felt in need of rest. As they rode down the steep path, Bilbo heard the elves still singing in the trees, as if they had not stopped since he left; and as soon as their riders came down into the lower glades of the wood they burst into a song of much the same kind as before. This is something like it: Then the elves of the valley came out and greeted them and led them across the water to the house of Elrond. There a warm welcome was made them, and there were many eager ears that evening to hear the tale of their adventures. Gandalf it was who spoke, for Bilbo was fallen quiet and drowsy. Most of the tale he knew, for he had been in it, and had himself told much of it to the wizard on their homeward way or in the house of Beorn; but every now and again he would open one eye, and listen, when a part of the story which he did not yet know came in. It was in this way that he learned where Gandalf had been to; for he overheard the words of the wizard to Elrond. It appeared that Gandalf had been to a great council of the white wizards, masters of lore and good magic; and that they had at last driven the Necromancer from his dark hold in the south of Mirkwood. \"Ere long now,\" Gandalf was saying, \"The Forest will grow somewhat more wholesome. The North will be freed from that horror for many long years, I hope. Yet I wish he were banished from the world!\" \"It would be well indeed,\" said Elrond; \"but I fear that will not come about in this age of the world, or for many after.\" When the tale of their joumeyings was told, there were other tales, and yet more tales, tales of long ago, and tales . of new things, and tales of no time at all, till Bilbo\u0027s head fell forward on his chest, and he snored comfortably in a corner. He woke to find himself in a white bed, and the moon shining through an open window. Below it many elves were singing loud and clear on the banks of the stream. \"Well, Merry People!\" said Bilbo looking out. \"What time by the moon is this? Your lullaby would waken a drunken goblin! Yet I thank you.\" \"And your snores would waken a stone dragon — yet we thank you,\" they answered with laughter. \"It is drawing towards dawn, and you have slept now since the night\u0027s beginning. Tomorrow, perhaps, you will be cured of weariness.\" \"A little sleep does a great cure in the house of Elrond,\" said he; \"but I will take all the cure I can get. A second good night, fair friends!\" And with that he went back to bed and slept till late morning. Weariness fell from him soon in that house, and he had many a merry jest and dance, early and late, with the elves of the valley. Yet even that place could not long delay him now, and he thought always of his own home. After a week, therefore, he said farewell to Elrond, and giving him such small gifts as he would accept, he rode away with Gandalf. Even as they left the valley the sky darkened in the West before them, and wind and rain came up to meet them. \"Merry is May-time!\" said Bilbo, as the rain beat into his face. \"But our back is to legends and we are coming home. I suppose this is a first taste of it.\" \"There is a long road yet,\" said Gandalf. \"But it is the last road,\" said Bilbo. They came to the river that marked the very edge of the borderland of the Wild, and to the ford beneath the steep bank, which you may remember. The water was swollen both with the melting of the snows at the approach of summer, and with the daylong rain; but they crossed with some difficulty, and pressed forward, as evening fell, on the last stage of their journey. This was much as it had been before, except that the company was smaller, and more silent; also this time there were no trolls. At each point on the road Bilbo recalled the happenings and the words of a year ago-it seemed to him more like ten-so that, of course, he quickly noted the place where the pony had fallen in the river, and they had turned aside for their nasty adventure with Tom and Bert and Bill. Not far from the road they found the gold of the trolls, which they had buried, still hidden and untouched. \"I have enough to last me my time,\" said Bilbo, when they had dug it up. \"You had better take this, Gandalf. I daresay you can find a use for it.\" \"Indeed I can!\" said the wizard. \"But share and share alike! You may find you have more needs than you expect.\" So they put the gold in bags and slung them on the ponies, who were not at all pleased about it. After that their going was slower, for most of the time they walked. But the land was green and there was much grass through which the hobbit strolled along contentedly. He mopped his face with a red silk handkerchief-no! not a single one of his own had survived, he had borrowed this one from Elrond —for now June had brought summer, and the weather was bright and hot again. As all things come to an end, even this story, a day came at last when they were in sight of the country where Bilbo had been born and bred, where the shapes of the land and of the trees were as well known to him as his hands and toes. Coming to a rise he could see his own Hill in the distance, and he stopped suddenly and said: Gandalf looked at him. \"My dear Bilbo!\" he said. \"Something is the matter with you! You are not the hobbit that you were.\" And so they crossed the bridge and passed the mill by the river and came right back to Bilbo\u0027s own door. \"Bless me! What\u0027s going on?\" he cried. There was a great commotion, and people of all sorts, respectable and unrespectable, were thick round the door, and many were going in and out-not even wiping their feet on the mat, as Bilbo noticed with annoyance. If he was surprised, they were more surprised still. He had arrived back in the middle of an auction! There was a large notice in black and red hung on the gate, stating that on June the Twenty-second Messrs. Grubb, Grubb, and Bun-owes would sell by auction the effects of the late Bilbo Baggins Esquire, of Bag-End, Underhill, Hobbiton. Sale to commence at ten o\u0027clock sharp. It was now nearly lunch-time, and most of the things had already been sold, for various prices from next to nothing to old songs (as is not unusual at auctions). Bilbo\u0027s cousins the Sackville-Bagginses were, in fact, busy measuring his rooms to see if their own furniture would fit. In short Bilbo was \"Presumed Dead,\" and not everybody that said so was sorry to find the presumption wrong. The return of Mr. Bilbo Baggins created quite a disturbance, both under the Hill and over the Hill, and across the Water; it was a great deal more than a nine days\u0027 wonder. The legal bother, indeed, lasted for years. It was quite a long time before Mr. Baggins was in fact admitted to be alive again. The people who had got specially good bargains at the Sale took a deal of convincing; and in the end to sav6 time Bilbo had to buy back quite a lot of his own furniture. Many of his silver spoons mysteriously disappeared and were never accounted for. Personally he suspected the Sackville-Bagginses. On their side they never admitted that the returned Baggins was genuine, and they were not on friendly terms with Bilbo ever after. They really had wanted to live in his nice hobbit-hole so very much. Indeed Bilbo found he had lost more than spoons — he had lost his reputation. It is true that for ever after he remained an elf-friend, and had the honour of dwarves, wizards, and all such folk as ever passed that way; but he was no longer quite respectable. He was in fact held by all the hobbits of the neighbourhood to be \u0027queer\u0027-except by his nephews and nieces on the Took side, but even they were not encouraged in their friendship by their elders. I am sorry to say he did not mind. He was quite content; and the sound of the kettle on his hearth was ever after more musical than it had been even in the quiet days before the Unexpected Party. His sword he hung over the mantelpiece. His coat of mail was arranged on a stand in the hall (until he lent it to a Museum). His gold and silver was largely spent in presents, both useful and extravagant — which to a certain extent accounts for the affection of his nephews and his nieces. His magic ring he kept a great secret, for he chiefly used it when unpleasant callers came. He took to writing poetry and visiting the elves; and though many shook their heads and touched their foreheads and said \"Poor old Baggins!\" and though few believed any of his tales, he remained very happy to the end of his days, and those were extraordinarily long. One autumn evening some years afterwards Bilbo was sitting in his study writing his memoirs — he thought of calling them \"There and Back Again, a Hobbit\u0027s Holiday\" — when there was a ring at the door. It was Gandalf and a dwarf; and the dwarf was actually Balin. \"Come in! Come in!\" said Bilbo, and soon they were settled in chairs by the fire. If Balin noticed that Mr. Baggins\u0027 waistcoat was more extensive (and had real gold buttons), Bilbo also noticed that Balm\u0027s beard was several inches longer, and his jewelled belt was of great magnificence. They fell to talking of their times together, of course, and Bilbo asked how things were going in the lands of the Mountain. It seemed they were going very well. Bard had rebuilt the town in Dale and men had gathered to him from the Lake and from South and West, and all the valley had become tilled again and rich, and the desolation was now filled with birds and blossoms in spring and fruit and feasting in autumn. And Lake-town was refounded and was more prosperous than ever, and much wealth went up and down the Running River; and there was friendship in those parts between elves and dwarves and men. The old Master had come to a bad end. Bard had given him much gold for the help of the Lake-people, but being of the kind that easily catches such disease he fell under the dragon-sickness, and took most of the gold and fled with it, and died of starvation in the Waste, deserted by his companions. \"The new Master is of wiser kind,\" said Balin, \"and very popular, for, of course, he gets most of the credit for the present prosperity. They are making songs which say that in his day the rivers run with gold.\" \"Then the prophecies of the old songs have turned out to be true, after a fashion!\" said Bilbo. \"Of course!\" said Gandalf. \"And why should not they prove true? Surely you don\u0027t disbelieve the prophecies, because you had a hand in bringing them about yourself? You don\u0027t really suppose, do you, that all your adventures and escapes were managed by mere luck, just for your sole benefit? You are a very fine person, Mr. Baggins, and I am very fond of you; but you are only quite a little fellow in a wide world after all!\" \"Thank goodness!\" said Bilbo laughing, and handed him the tobacco-jar.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/50/227.html","bookId":743,"book":{"id":743,"title":"The Hobbit魔戒前传：霍比特人","description":"简介： The Hobbit, or There and Back Again, better known by its abbreviated title The Hobbit, is a fantasy novel and children\u0027s book by J.
