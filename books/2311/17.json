{"id":95663,"no":17,"title":"Page 17","content":"\"This,\" McCarthy said as they sat around the worktable four hours later, eating frozen dinners and staring at computer-printed floor plans, \"is a really stupid idea, Jazz. I mean, you\u0027ve had some stupid ideas before, and God bless you, you\u0027ve pulled them off, but I don\u0027t know about this one. If these guys are as all-knowing as you say - \" \"They\u0027re not all-knowing,\" Simms said. \"But you don\u0027t know what they do know, or when, right?\" Simms shrugged. \"Eidolon has more than twenty psychics feeding them predictions. Some of those may sense what you\u0027re about to do. But I think they\u0027d likely discount this because it is so stupidly confrontational.\" \"Hey!\" Jazz cried. Lucia patted her on the shoulder. \"Stupid is good. Clever would get us killed.\" McCarthy smiled, briefly. \"Not you, apparently.\" \"Shut up.\" He cocked an eyebrow. \"You and Borden, wanting a piece of me today. What\u0027s that about?\" \"I have better reasons.\" The color drained out of his face when she said that, and she wished she hadn\u0027t; it wasn\u0027t like her to rub it in. The shock of those obscene photographs was still vivid. She\u0027d taken them to Manny\u0027s shredder and reduced them to a pile of thin crosscut strips, then run them through an acid wash to destroy any chance of reconstruction. Manny\u0027s idea, when he\u0027d finally rejoined them, although he hadn\u0027t asked what was on the photos. It seemed likely her expression had told him enough. McCarthy was mutely waiting. \"Work first.\" She had more than enough to think about. She wondered if she dared ask Manny to run a pregnancy test for her, or if she wanted to wait until later, until this was over and she was free to walk into a store and have nothing but a normal woman\u0027s anxieties. \"I\u0027m sorry. Cheap shot.\" \"It\u0027s not like I don\u0027t deserve it.\" \"Guys, wallow in whatever you\u0027re wallowing in later,\" Jazz snapped. \"Focus, already. This is serious.\" Lucia sucked in a deep breath. \"We go in through the front door, take the device to the server room and position it. Meanwhile, Manny\u0027s guy - \" Manny knew guys who could do just about anything \" - hacks into the off-site data storage facility and arranges for a system crash there. They may have redundant backup systems - we have to watch out for that. Manny\u0027s guy will be monitoring and will kill any off-site systems they try to bring online. Meanwhile, we set off the EMP in their server room. In and out, fast, in the general confusion.\" \"You\u0027re going to get yourselves killed,\" Borden said. He was sitting at the far end of the table, with his hands handcuffed in front now, not behind. \"Jazz, don\u0027t do this. You have no idea what you\u0027re getting into, you don\u0027t. Really.\" \"You have no idea what we\u0027re getting into, either, Borden,\" Lucia said without looking up. \"We\u0027ve tried it your way. It hasn\u0027t worked. Time for a new approach.\" He was rubbing his head furiously now, handcuffs clinking together. \"Jazz, I\u0027m begging you. Please.\" Jazz said, \"Manny, you\u0027re going to keep him secured, right?\" \"Absolutely,\" he agreed. He sounded depressed. \"But I don\u0027t like it. I don\u0027t like any of this.\" \"You think I do?\" she snapped back, and covered her eyes with her hands, pressing. \"I\u0027m sorry. Tired. I want this over, dammit.\" \"And I want everybody out of my house,\" Manny said. \"So yeah, I\u0027ll watch him. I\u0027ll do what you need me to do. But when this is over, everybody gets out. And you pay me for my time. And we go back to the way things were.\" \"Fine,\" Lucia said. Jazz started to protest, but Lucia overrode her. \"Fine. I have no objection to that. Jazz, you\u0027ll be okay here for a while? I need to go home.\" Jazz immediately looked alarmed. \"What\u0027s wrong?\" \"Nothing.\" Everything. \"I just need a shower and clean clothes and a nap. Plus, the item\u0027s being delivered to me there. I\u0027ll bring it here once it arrives.\" \"I don\u0027t like you going out,\" she replied. \"She\u0027s perfectly safe,\" Simms said. \"See?\" Lucia pushed back from the table and had to brace herself. She felt light-headed from too much caffeine, not nearly enough rest. God only knew how much abuse her body had taken in the past few weeks, but it was starting to make its displeasure with the situation very clear. \"A nap is all I need.\" \"Take it here,\" Jazz said. \"We have an unbelievable bathroom, too. Seven showerheads. Marble tiles. Whirlpool.\" It sounded, literally, like heaven, but she needed something that she couldn\u0027t get here. Silence. Peace. Solitude. She shook her head. \"I\u0027ll go,\" she said. \"Everybody else stays.\" Jazz opened her mouth. \"I mean it, damn you. Follow orders, for once in your life.\" McCarthy snorted. \"Manny, can I - \" He tossed her the keys to the Hummer before she\u0027d even gotten the words out. She nodded in gratitude. \"Gas it up,\" he called after her. \"And wash it while you\u0027re at it!\" Because, of course, saving the world wasn\u0027t work enough. She was at the steel door when she felt someone behind her, and turned to see McCarthy. He leaned a hand on the metal, another on the wall, boxing her in. \"You really going?\" he asked. \"Yes. I really am.\" He lowered his voice. \"You want to take a test?\" She nodded mutely. \"Can I come with you?\" \"It isn\u0027t safe. You heard Simms.\" \"Sweetheart, I\u0027ve been in danger my whole life. I survived some nights in Ellsworth that you wouldn\u0027t believe. I think I can survive a day in your company.\" He was slowly leaning closer, as if her gravity was pulling him in. \"Let me come with you. Please.\" She looked over his shoulder. Jazz was studying floor plans and ignoring Borden, and he was staring at her with naked suffering on his face. \"Let me.\" Ben\u0027s breath was warm against her face, his voice an intimate whisper in her ear. He pulled back enough to look into her eyes. \"You told me to make a choice based on what I want, not what you want. Well, this is it.\" She turned away, opened the door and went down the stairs. She looked back. He was standing at the top, watching her, holding the door open. \"Coming?\" she asked. The door boomed shut behind him as he ran down the steps toward her. It seemed oddly normal, shopping at the drugstore - picking up a few odds and ends she knew she was running short of. McCarthy silently followed her as she strolled the aisles, and she finally turned to the shelves filled with feminine products. Pregnancy tests were at the top. She stared at the choices blindly for a moment, then reached up and took one at random. It looked simple enough. As she was reading the back, she said, \"This could all be a lie, you know.\" \"Yeah. And if it isn\u0027t, it probably didn\u0027t even work, what they were - doing to you. It doesn\u0027t, right? Not all the time\" She added the test to her basket and went to the checkout counter. The clerk didn\u0027t make any comments, and neither did she. She wondered idly which was more uncomfortable, buying intimate things like this or seeing a steady progression of them all day. Teenage boys with boxes of condoms. Hell, middle-aged matrons with boxes of condoms. Pregnancy tests. The clerk met her eyes briefly and smiled. \"Good luck.\" She led the way back to the vehicle, climbed in and piloted the thing to her apartment. The apartment was undisturbed. The upgraded security monitors - Jazz\u0027s doing - showed no intrusions, but then, if Gregory decided to pay another visit, they probably wouldn\u0027t. He\u0027d been the one to come and get her; she knew it beyond any doubt. That first night, when she\u0027d woken on the couch and found him in the apartment, had been his dry run, to test the system. He\u0027d almost warned her then, she realized. Almost. She locked the door and reset the alarms, and exchanged a silent look with McCarthy. \"You do what you need to do,\" he said, and went into the kitchen. He pulled a beer from the fridge. \"I\u0027ll be here.\" She went into the bathroom with the box, took off her clothes and grimaced at the state of her hair and general hygiene. She stepped into the shower and let herself fall into a kind of trance, lulled by the warm water, the floral scents of the shampoo and soaps. Maybe it isn\u0027t true. Maybe none of this is true. She finished and stepped out of the shower, damp and glowing, and decisively ripped open the package to find the test kit. Ten minutes later, she stared at the single blue line on the strip. Oh, my God. She found herself sliding down against the tiled wall, staring at the plastic holder and the blue line. Such a simple thing, to make so many terrible things real. She dumped it into the trash can, then followed it with her clothes, for no better reason than she never wanted to wear them again, or see them again. She washed her hands with vicious thoroughness. She wrapped herself in her soft fleece robe, damp hair straggling down her back, and opened the bathroom door. McCarthy stood there, holding out two choices - beer and soft drink. She took the soft drink. He let out his breath in a long, low sigh and turned away. She thought he was all right for a second, and then he let out a harsh yell, punched the wall with his right hand, then leaned his forehead against the plaster. \"Feel better?\" she asked neutrally. She sipped the cola, grateful for the sweetness, grateful for something that felt normal in this increasingly alien world. \"My hand hurts,\" he said. \"Define better.\" \"Why did you want to be here?\" \"Why did you want me to be here?\" \"Turn around,\" she said. He did, setting his beer down on the table untouched. She put her drink down as well, and crossed the small distance between them. Neither of them reached out. \"So how does it feel,\" she asked, \"knowing you\u0027re going to be a father?\" He laughed. It was a wild kind of laugh, on the edge of fury, and she stopped it cold by putting her hands on his shoulders, then cupping his face. He needed a shave. His beard scraped warm across her palms. \"They took away our choices,\" she said. \"But only for a moment, Ben. Only for a moment. Because it would have come to this, sooner or later, and you know it.\" She let go of him, and took hold of the sash that held her robe closed. She untied it with slow, deliberate motions and let the fabric move away, revealing the gap between her breasts, then the inner slopes. His breath caught, and he reached out to slowly slide the robe across her shoulders, fingers lightly skimming skin, and then down over her arms. She let the robe fall to the floor. She led him to the bed and put her hands on his shoulders. \"Don\u0027t move.\" She\u0027d never seen him this way before, so quiet and yet so tense. It wasn\u0027t passivity, it was intensity waiting to break free, and it made her breath grow short, her cheeks burn, her fingers shake. The buttons on his shirt surrendered, and underneath that his chest was defined, not muscular, and covered by a mat of graying dark hair. She ran her fingers possessively through its coarse texture, then down to hook into the waistband of his blue jeans. He stopped breathing and closed his eyes. Fighting to stay still. She popped the button loose, and ran her fingernail slowly down the zipper. Teasing. Felt him shudder... He had more control than she could imagine. She remembered him turning away from her, knowing there would be a price for his refusal. Maybe a fatal one. He\u0027d never expected that they\u0027d abduct her and force a medical rape on her. She had to believe that. She took hold of the zipper tab and dragged it down, one slow click at a time. He let out his breath in a rushing moan as she put her palms flat on his hips, then pulled on the loosened jeans, sending them tumbling in a heap over his feet. Well, that answered the questions she\u0027d briefly entertained about his preferences in underwear...not that it mattered now. The briefs followed the pants to the floor. She ran her hands slowly from his collarbone across his chest, down the fluttering muscles of his stomach. Down. \"Ben,\" she whispered. \"You can move now.\" He opened his eyes and she burned in the fire of them, and then that intensity was loose. His mouth was everywhere, finding every untouched place to draw a gasp or a moan, those clever fingers knowing exactly where to press, how to move. The things he was saying flowed through her, thick and sweet as honey, words shaped on skin. He drove her mad with words, and then they left the hobbles of language behind, and it was only intensity, and passion, and love spoken in flesh. In the moment of white-hot transcendence she felt herself embrace that spark of life buried deep inside, and wrap the whirlwind around it. Giving it not just life, but purpose. Ben collapsed against her, gasping for air, and she ran her hands through his graying curls. \"That,\" he finally managed to growl, \"was not what I expected.\" \"Not as good?\" \"Idiot,\" he murmured, and put his head back down. She laughed. After a few seconds, so did he, deep rumbles from his stomach, subsonic waves through her skin. If Simms could see us now, she thought, and was momentarily chilled by the idea that, just perhaps, he could. And so could Eidolon. There was no way to understand right and wrong anymore. There was only good, and she had to seek it. She turned toward McCarthy\u0027s warmth, his love, his sense of safety. Toward the good. She woke up fast to a loud buzzing sound, and catapulted out of bed naked, reaching for her gun, before she realized two things. One, the sound was the intercom calling for attention. Two, Ben McCarthy had rolled out of bed on the opposite side, and he had a gun in his hand as well. They shared rueful smiles, and she kept the weapon in her hand on the way to the keypad, to press the call button. \"Yes?\" \"Sorry to buzz you so early, Ms. Garza, but there was a special delivery for you. The guy said to tell you that it\u0027s a package from back East. That make any sense? I can\u0027t read the label.\" \"No, that\u0027s fine, I\u0027m expecting it. I\u0027ll be down in a minute, thanks.\" She turned back to find McCarthy pulling on his briefs, then his jeans. She walked to him without hesitation and stepped into the circle of his arms, her bare skin pressed against his from the waist up. The luxury of it nearly overwhelmed her. His left hand moved lightly up the curve of her arm, and in the morning light she saw a fine lacework of lines around his eyes when he smiled at her. They deepened when she stroked her fingers through the warm mat of hair on his chest. \"No regrets?\" he asked her. \"Why in God\u0027s name would I have regrets?\" He traced the line of her cheekbone with his thumb. \"I\u0027m old, you know.\" \"Older,\" she acknowledged. \"Didn\u0027t slow you down.\" \"Oh, it did,\" he said, and dropped a slow, warm Mss on the skin of her collarbone. \"But that has compensations. Lets me concentrate on getting the most out of every... single...moment.\" \"I noticed.\" When had her voice taken on that particular low purr? You can\u0027t be distracted like this, some cold part of her brain said. You\u0027re drunk on him, Sober up. There are things to do. She couldn\u0027t stop touching him. His lips moved across her throat, up to the column of her neck. \"I have to...get...the package,\" she murmured. \"Yes, you do.\" \"Things to do.\" \"Important things.\" Her fingers curled in the waistband of his pants. \"I just got those on,\" he murmured against her skin. His hands were wandering, too, down her back, down the smooth curve of her hips. Inward. \"Stop.\" She tugged at his pants, pulling him harder against her when he tried to move back for better access. \"I have to go downstairs.\" \"Like that? They\u0027ll be thrilled.\" \"Dressed. I have to get dressed.\" She finally found some strength to put behind that statement. \"Ben, no. I have to do this.\" He stopped playing, and the smile slowly died. \"Do you?\" He searched her face intently. \"Are you sure?\" \"I\u0027m sure that I can\u0027t live like this. And neither can you, or Jazz, or for that matter, Simms and Borden. If Simms is right, I could be the only one left standing if I don\u0027t act. So yes. I\u0027m sure.\" She read the fear in him. \"I\u0027ll be all right.\" \"Simms sold out about twenty of his friends, so far as I could tell. Forgive me for not trusting him with your life.\" She stopped him with a kiss, a long one. \"I have to go.\" She dressed quickly, just underwear, jeans and T-shirt, feet in a pair of flat shoes. Her hair still looked loose and tumbled, and she could smell McCarthy all over her skin. She reset the alarm on the way out - native paranoia - and took the stairs to stretch the soreness out of her leg muscles. Marsh glanced up as she came out the fire door, took in the way she looked, and wisely said nothing beyond a polite, \"Good morning, Ms. Garza.\" She signed the clipboard and picked up the package. It was, as Gregory had predicted, heavy; not something one could slip easily into a purse. She\u0027d need a duffel bag, or a backpack. She was thinking about it on the way back up the stairs, but the extra weight in her arms made her slower. She stopped to readjust the weight on the third floor landing, and as she did, she heard the ground floor door open, and hard-soled shoes coming up. Men\u0027s shoes, from the sound of it. Two or three pairs of them. \" - both there. Be ready. She\u0027s a tough little bitch, and McCarthy\u0027s a stone-cold killer. He\u0027ll fight to protect her. I don\u0027t want any shooting if we can help it.\" \"If it comes to that - \" \"If it comes to that, kill McCarthy, but don\u0027t kill her. We need her. Understand?\" Voices carried. Lucia ran almost soundlessly up another flight, eased open the fire door and sprinted for the elevator. There was an intercom button next to the Up and Down; she slapped her palm on it, juggling the package clumsily. \"Security! Security, pickup!\" \"Security, yes ma\u0027am.\" \"Get up to the sixth floor. There are three men on then-way to my apartment and - \" \"Ms. Garza? This is Marsh, ma\u0027am. Those men are police officers. They came in just after you picked up the package - they had a warrant. Nothing I could do.\" \"Shit,\" she whispered, and slapped the call button for the elevator. \"Marsh, listen to me. Those men are not police officers.\" \"I checked their badges - \" \"Marsh!\" She cut him off coldly, furiously. \"I need you to go along with me here. Please. You have information that they\u0027re imposters, and you\u0027re just doing your job when you lock the damn fire door on the sixth floor!\" \"Ma\u0027am...\" He debated for a second, then another. \"I suppose they could have been fake credentials. We have to take all reasonable precautions.\" They\u0027d be to the fourth floor by now. Maybe the fifth, if they were in a hurry. \"Marsh? Are you locking them out?\" No answer. The elevator arrived. She lunged into it and hit the sixth floor button convulsively, willing it to go faster. The intercom inside of the elevator came alive. \"Ms. Garza?\" \"Yes, Marsh!\" Dammit, she hadn\u0027t even brought her gun. Hadn\u0027t come prepared at all for trouble. This is what happiness brings you. Disaster. She had let herself be comforted, and that was death to caution. \"We appear to have had a circuit fault on the sixth floor fire door. It\u0027s locked down. The cops are making their way up to seven.\" \"And that one will be locked when they get there?\" \"Probably. Fault in the system, ma\u0027am. But I can\u0027t promise you more than ten minutes, max. That\u0027s the most I can do.\" \"That\u0027s good enough.\" The doors opened on the sixth floor. \"Thank you.\" She made it to her apartment, unlocked the door, and caught McCarthy in the act of putting on his shirt. He looked up, startled, and she saw him take in the expression on her face. He reached for his shoulder holster and strapped it on. \"Trouble?\" \"Ken Stewart\u0027s coming with some kind of warrant. No idea what it is, but it doesn\u0027t matter. Eidolan\u0027s nervous. He\u0027s here to slow us down,\" she said. \"Take this.\" She handed him the package and grabbed the first thing she could find in the closet - a black canvas backpack, sturdy enough. The alarm started a shrill warning beep by the time she shoved the EMP device inside and zipped the bag. \"You going to shut the alarm off?\" \"No. The more confusion, the better.\" She grabbed her gun, holster and purse, and moved past him to the closet at the back. \"Come on.\" She shouldered the backpack. \"Where?\" \"Back door.\" It wasn\u0027t, exactly, but what building engineers didn\u0027t know wouldn\u0027t kill them. Though it might give them a good fit of pique... She shoved aside the coats in the closet and pressed hard on the wall behind, which swung open with a sharp pop of magnets coming loose. It had been opened before. She saw sets of tracks in the pale dust. Gregory Ivanovich. He\u0027d known that she would have built in an escape hatch. And he\u0027d used it against her. \"What the hell...?\" McCarthy marveled. \"Shut it behind you.\" She ducked into the crawl space. Short and dusty, it led into wiring tunnels, which dumped into a service shaft for the air handlers, with a long straight ladder down a central column. She started downward. Somewhere above, in her apartment, she heard the alarm start to wail. Good. That meant confusion, more cops, possibly even a fire truck or two. The building\u0027s clientele this rich, and most of them important. The rich also came with an automatic upgrade of press coverage. With any luck, it would turn into a zoo outside. She didn\u0027t trust luck. She jumped the last five rungs of the ladder, landed flat-footed in a crouch and had her gun in a two-handed grip as she advanced to the door. No sound beyond. She eased it open a fraction of an inch, but the basement hallway was empty. \"Right.\" She shut the door and turned to look at McCarthy. \"We need to make it to the Hummer. They\u0027ll be waiting somewhere along the line. They may even have the garage exits blocked off.\" \"They could have towed the truck,\" he reminded her. \"No, I don\u0027t think so. Not many towing services could handle it, and they\u0027d have a hard time getting a flatbed truck down where we parked it, or getting the Hummer out if they did. Low ceilings. They\u0027ll just guard it. Less trouble.\" He nodded. \"I\u0027m right behind you.\" \"I know.\" \"Try not to shoot anybody.\" \"Funny,\" she said grimly, \"that\u0027s what they said. They want me alive.\" That sparked something in his eyes that was hot and hungry. \"I take it back,\" he said. \"Shoot somebody. Preferably that rat bastard Stewart, if you see him.\" She took a deep breath and swung open the door, then ran, light-footed, to the end of the hall. The parking lot beyond seemed deserted. No sign of surveillance or ambush. The Hummer loomed huge and black at the far corner, apart from the smaller cars and trucks. She started to move forward, but McCarthy caught her arm and shook his head. He mimed splitting up, him to the right, her to the left. She shook her own head and fished the keys out of her pocket. \"Together,\" she whispered, making barely a sound. He stared at her face, and nodded. \"Together.\" It wasn\u0027t more than a movement of his lips, but it was a promise. They broke from cover and ran for it. Nobody stopped them. She hit the alarm remote control and unlocked the doors, threw herself into the driver\u0027s side and put the backpack on the floorboard as Ben climbed in the passenger door. The interior looked cool, dark and untouched. \"Too easy,\" he said, and immediately began to look for trouble out the windows. Nothing moved. \"Maybe the alarms upstairs distracted them,\" she said, and hit the ignition. The SUV started up with a rumble, and she backed it fast out of the space, not particularly worried about crumpled fenders or damaged quarter panels. \u0027They\u0027ll have us blocked in,\" McCarthy warned. His gun was out. She nodded and gave him a lupine grin. \"Let me worry about that. The army doesn\u0027t use these monsters just because of their pretty paint jobs.\" \"Manny\u0027s going to kill you.\" \"Better him than Ken Stewart, wouldn\u0027t you say? And if you\u0027re going to shoot, roll down the window.\" He shook his head and watched the parking garage whip by as she accelerated the Hummer up the curving ramp toward escape. \"Wild woman.\" Bet your ass, she thought, and pressed the accelerator to the floor when she saw daylight, and two police cars blocking it. She honked, a loud blare, though they could hardly have missed a huge, black SUV barreling upward, engine roaring. Sure enough, the cops had prudently decided to leave empty cars in her path. The Hummer hardly even shuddered at the impact. It slewed out into traffic as she whipped the wheel, burned rubber, and it stayed upright only because of the wide wheel base as she steered it down Vine Street. \"You realize that I\u0027ll be going to back to prison,\" McCarthy said, almost casually. \"Doing crash tests with squad cars, that\u0027s some kind of crime. I know - I used to be a detective.\" \"Shut up. You\u0027re a hostage.\" \"I\u0027m a what?\" \"Hostage. You can truthfully say that I abducted you.\" \"I\u0027m driving, after all.\" \"You know, my life with you might be short, but damn, it\u0027s going to be memorable.\" She dug one-handed in her purse, came up with her cell phone and flipped it open. Voice-activated a call to Jazz, because she needed most of her attention for keeping the Hummer on the road and watching for any police cars moving to intercept. She had to get this thing off main streets fast, before air surveillance could get to them. Preferably, they needed to change cars. The closest chance would be six blocks away, in a parking garage behind a bank building. \"Yeah?\" Jazz sounded sleepy. \"Three detectives showed up at my place this morning, with friends in patrol cars,\" Lucia said. She hit the speakerphone button and dropped the phone to the seat. \"I can\u0027t come back to Manny\u0027s. We need to move, now, or we won\u0027t get another chance.\" \"Damn!\" Jazz was wide awake now. \"Don\u0027t you go without me.\" \"I may not have a choice. Jazz, I don\u0027t think it\u0027s safe for you to leave the bunker.\" \"Have I ever done what\u0027s safe? I\u0027ll get Manny in motion on the computer stuff. Wait for me.\" She hung up. Lucia shook her head and whipped the Hummer into a hard right turn, slowed her speed and then made an immediate left into the parking garage. \"What are we doing?\" \"Switching cars.\" Ben sighed. \"Car theft. I\u0027m almost sure that\u0027s a crime.\" \"It\u0027s my own car. I have three of them, parked in central locations around the city, all accessible from mass transportation.\" \"Look,\" he said slowly, \"don\u0027t take this the wrong way, but who hides cars all over the city and has a secret escape hatch in her apartment, just in case?\" She took the ramp up. Second level. The Hummer barely made it - this was an old structure with low ceilings. \"I\u0027m a professional, Ben. And that\u0027s really all you need to know until I can get you into a warm bed, serve you some wine and tell you the story of my life.\" \"Promise?\" \"Yes,\" she said softly. \"I promise.\" She pulled the Hummer into two spaces - it wouldn\u0027t fit in just one - next to a dull green minivan. \"Out. Grab whatever you think we\u0027ll need from the back. Flak vests, definitely. Rocket launchers optional.\" She took her purse and the backpack holding the EMP. She had the minivan started when McCarthy slid inside. He had a Kevlar vest. \"FBI issue,\" he noted. \"Without the FBI printing. Yes. I think Manny has some friends in federal procurement. Did you get one for me?\" \"Basic black,\" he said. \"Goes with everything. Jazz is meeting us?\" \"Says she is.\" \"I got extra.\" \"Of everything?\" \"Pretty much.\" They hit sunlight, and she steered the minivan toward the freeway. \"I forgot to ask,\" he said. \"Where is Eidolon\u0027s great big headquarters of evil, anyway?\" \"Las Vegas,\" she said. He smiled. \"Yes,\" she agreed. \"After we save the world, we can take in a show.\" \"We take Simms, we could gamble.\" Ben glanced out the window, checking for tails. \"What about a Vegas wedding?\" \"That can\u0027t be a proposal.\" \"Why not?\" \"Let\u0027s see - I hardly know you, we\u0027re on our way to a suicidally crazy mission, and I\u0027m pregnant from immaculate conception. You\u0027d be insane to propose to me now.\" \"Haven\u0027t you noticed that I\u0027m not necessarily sane?\" She stopped for a light, the last one, and looked over at him for a long few seconds. \"I have,\" she admitted. \"It\u0027s one of your better qualities.\" \"Vegas wedding,\" he said, and leaned his head back against the plush upholstery as she accelerated the van through the green light and made the on ramp. \"I\u0027m going to sleep now.\" It was going to be a twenty-hour drive, at least. Lucia settled in, and wondered how Jazz was expecting to meet her. She just knew, though, that somehow, Jazz would. Jazz showed up at a diner outside of Fremont Junction in Utah, and immediately took a turn behind the wheel. \"Simms,\" she said, which eliminated the need for any other explanations. Lucia, who\u0027d already switched off with McCarthy once, gladly gave up driving and stretched out on the bench seat behind. McCarthy stayed in the passenger seat, talking in low tones with Jazz, and Lucia slipped off into a deep, exhausted sleep for a few hours, until the van stopped for gas again in Cedar City. She was driving once more when they crossed a narrow strip of Arizona desert, black and hypnotic at night, and then into Nevada. The sun rose as they approached Las Vegas, and all three of them were wide awake for it. \"Straight there,\" Jazz said, as she stripped off her flannel shirt and pulled a bulletproof vest over her long-sleeved T-shirt. She snugged it tight, then donned the flannel shirt again. \"No stops, right? Simms said it himself. The more we keep in motion, the harder it is for them to predict where we\u0027re going to be.\" \"I hope he\u0027s right,\" Lucia said grimly. \"This isn\u0027t home turf for either of us.\" \"We\u0027ll be okay.\" Jazz grinned at her, the devil in her eyes. \"We\u0027re the scary ones, remember?\" \"Boy,\" McCarthy said without looking up as he cinched his own vest tight, \"you\u0027re really not wrong on that one.\" They cruised down the strip, because it was there and besides, it was on the way, and Jazz made verbal note of all the things she wanted to do later, when things were over. It was nervous talk. No matter how it came out, Lucia doubted they\u0027d be hanging around to catch Cirque du Soleil. Jazz got on the phone. \"Manny? Your guy ready to rock?\" \"Two guys,\" he said on speakerphone. \"On your word. Jazz? Got a call from Agent Rawlins. They\u0027re letting Susannah Davis go today.\" \"What? They were supposed to keep her in protective custody!\" \"She stopped cooperating. He said either we pick her up, or they show her the door and she can call a cab. What do you want me to do?\" Jazz chewed her lip and raised her eyebrows. Lucia said, \"Can Pansy pick her up? Bring her to the bunker until we get back?\" Manny didn\u0027t like it; that much was obvious from his tone. \"Yeah. Okay. Not for more than a day, though. She doesn \u0027t stay here.\" \"Fine. Thank you, Manny. Go with Pansy, okay?\" \"Of course. Hey, I got the Hummer back. Cops are looking for you, but I guess you already knew that. Thanks for the damage.\" \"Yeah, sorry.\" \"I just ordered a red one. And it cost me ten grand to get the upgrades transferred over. You\u0027re paying for it.\" He hung up. Jazz sighed. \"Unbelievable. You\u0027ve seen the office, right? Ten grand to him is what he finds vacuuming the carpet.\" \"He\u0027s getting a red one? I didn\u0027t think it could possibly stick out any more.\" \"Well, let\u0027s face it, we don\u0027t love the damn thing for its ability to blend in...\" They both fell silent as Lucia made the last turn, and Jazz silently checked addresses. She pointed to a ten-story building at the end of the street. It wasn\u0027t pretty, wasn\u0027t ugly, wasn\u0027t much of anything. A nondescript structure, a victim of industrial-park architectural school. Glass and granite, concrete and steel. It looked strong, but not imposing. \"Parking,\" Lucia said. \"On the street?\" \"We all going to have our vests covered?\" asked Jazz. For answer, McCarthy put his shirt on over his and buttoned it. It looked tight, but would pass a quick visual inspection. Lucia had a problem for a second, because she didn\u0027t want the sweat-and-blister-inducing Kevlar against her bare skin, but by the time she\u0027d pulled into a space, Jazz had found an extra T-shirt in her duffel bag. Lucia donned it, then the heavy armor. McCarthy tightened the straps for her, although she didn\u0027t need the help, and Jazz handed her a blue-and-white-checked outer shirt. She buttoned it as far as her collarbone and picked up the backpack. \"Ready,\" she said. Jazz slid back the door under the blazing morning sun. \"I hope to hell it\u0027s Casual Friday in there.\" She opened the phone and speed-dialed Manny. \"We\u0027re going.\" Ben, as they\u0027d worked out on the drive, took up a post sitting in the lobby. He didn\u0027t look out of place, especially when he sat down with a copy of Business Week and relaxed with a foam cup next to him. It was surprisingly easy infiltrating the headquarters of Eidolon. Part of that was due to corporate mentality - there was security, and it involved key cards, but loitering at the elevators; talking idly until a group of workers showed up, netted a ride upstairs. Jazz and Lucia just drafted on the first one\u0027s key card through the big glass doors into the work area. Jazz knew the floor plans backward and forward, evidently. She unhesitatingly turned left, then right at a junction, then left. They ended up at the bathrooms. Lucia blinked, startled, but Jazz just lifted a shoulder. \"Look, I\u0027ve been on the road for what feels like a week, and if we\u0027re going to do this, the last thing I need is a full bladder, if you know what I mean.\" Lucia choked down a laugh and followed her. Business done, they took a quick stroll around the slowly filling work cubicles. It was a busy place - apparently, evil\u0027s stock was up this week - and every person they saw might know them, or at least their photographs. But this floor seemed to hold worker bees, not executives, and be devoted to systems and finance. There was an empty cubicle against the far wall. The server room - which they couldn\u0027t possibly get into - was on the other side. Lucia set the heavy backpack down with a breathless sigh of relief. \"You\u0027re sure there isn\u0027t shielding on the room?\" she asked. \"Not in the plans,\" Jazz said. \"We can\u0027t get this wrong.\" \"The server room\u0027s locked off, with special access. Our chances of getting in there - \" \"Go pull the fire alarm.\" \"What?\" \"Go pull the fire alarm. All electronic doors have to unlock in the event of a fire alarm. It\u0027s code.\" Jazz stared at her for a few seconds, then took out her cell phone and speed-dialed Manny once more. \"Get ready. Two minutes.\" She hung up without waiting for his reply. \"Right. Give me your stuff.\" Lucia handed over her purse and phone. \"I\u0027ll evacuate with the herd. You find me,\" Jazz said. \"Okay.\" Jazz grabbed her by the hand. \"L. Don\u0027t disappoint me and get killed, okay?\" Lucia, for answer, pulled her into a quick hug, kissed her on the cheek and said, \"Go.\" Then she grabbed the backpack, shouldered it and watched Jazz head for the fire alarm. She pulled it casually and kept walking. Alarms and overhead strobes erupted. A computerized voice came on the intercoms, over groans and shouts, and instructed everyone to head for their designated evacuation routes. Lucia stayed where she was, fiddling with her backpack, as people passed her cube. When she didn\u0027t hear any more footsteps, she ducked out and down the hall. The server room doors, labeled with warnings for halon gas systems, plus Restricted Access, Security Area signs, were unlocked. Heart pounding, she stepped inside, blinked at the huge array of servers. Ranks of boxes; blinking red and green lights. The air was cool and dry, the floor a raised, nonstatic surface, springy under her feet. She spotted a surveillance camera in the corner. They\u0027d have seen her by now. She had very little time. She slipped the backpack off her shoulder. During the endless drive, when McCarthy had been at the wheel, she\u0027d unpacked the EMP generator. It came in two pieces - the guts of the unit and a huge, heavy battery. She knelt and took the two parts, mated them together with a snap and flipped the toggle switch. Lights came on. \"Gregory, if you\u0027ve screwed me, I swear to God...\" She reached for the activate button, and froze when something cold touched the back of her head. \"This,\" a male voice said, \"is the barrel of a Beretta, and you\u0027re going to want to take your hand off the bomb.\" Fear and fury raced through her, powerful enough to make her sway, but she slowly raised both hands in the air. \"On both knees,\" he said, and kicked at her right foot, which was still on the ground. She shifted and obeyed. \"Hands behind your head.\" The voice sounded familiar, but congested, as if the speaker had a bad cold. She wanted to turn around, but the gun pressed to her head convinced her that curiosity was a bad idea. \"You expecting McCarthy to charge up here to the rescue? That son of a bitch is in custody downstairs. So\u0027s your friend Jazz. So you just be a good girl and take these - \" a gleaming pair of steel handcuffs jangled in front of her face \" - and put them on your right wrist first.\" She knew the voice now; she\u0027d finally placed it. Detective Stewart. He really didn\u0027t sound well. \"You don\u0027t have jurisdiction here.\" \"This has jurisdiction pretty much anywhere, bitch.\" He pressed with the gun barrel, hard enough to bruise. She winced and involuntarily moved her head forward; the gun followed. She took the handcuffs and snapped one on her right wrist, then - unasked - put her wrists behind her. He snapped them shut. \"Ready?\" a voice called from the doorway. \"Yeah, she\u0027s restrained. Come on in.\" The gun finally withdrew, letting her breathe a little, and she couldn\u0027t resist twisting to look over her shoulder as the door opened. Ken Stewart looked terrible - really terrible. His pallor had taken on a corpselike appearance, and his breathing seemed labored. His eyes were bloodshot and red-rimmed. He stepped back, giving the newcomers a respectful distance. There were three of them, all with executive polish. The one in front was middle-aged, with dark hair and dark eyes and a foxlike face that looked clever and cold. A slight asymmetry to his face made the right eye look smaller. He was rich, well-groomed, with an aura of absolute power. \"You\u0027re Lucia Garza,\" he said, and stepped forward. \"Stand up. Turn around.\" \"Careful,\" Stewart said. \"I said she was restrained, not safe.\" The man nodded. Lucia got up and turned to face them. \"I don\u0027t think we\u0027ve been introduced,\" she said. \"Not formally, no, but I\u0027ve been screwing with your life for quite some time now,\" the man said coolly. \"My name is Gil Kavanaugh. I run Eidolon Corporation.\" The man - no, the psychic - Simms had handpicked as his successor. The man who was the brains behind this side of the chess game, as Simms was behind the Cross Society. He seemed young for it, but she supposed that monomania was possible at any age. He looked her in the eyes and said, \"I\u0027m not responsible for what was done to you. That was the Cross Society, playing God. If I\u0027d had my way, Ben McCarthy would never have lived to get out of prison, and you wouldn\u0027t have ended up on a table with your legs apart, getting raped by doctors. Have they told you why it was so important?\" She felt a cold wave wash over her, and then hot prickles, as if her whole body had experienced numbness and rebirth. Her mind felt extraordinarily clear. \"You saw the pictures.\" He smiled. \"I see everything.\" He tapped his forehead. \"I\u0027m tuned to your channel, you see. Yours, your friends\u0027 - at the moment, you really do matter quite a lot. Pity about McCarthy, though. You never should have fallen in love with him. I warned you it would be a mistake - all right, I was somewhat oblique about it, but you\u0027re a bright woman. I admit, I didn\u0027t expect McCarthy to hold out like he did - I mean, what straight man just out of prison would? Look at you. Simms must have been pissed, after all the trouble he went to.\" Kavanaugh tilted his head slightly. \"Are you sure you don\u0027t want to know about the child?\" The fire alarms cut out suddenly, leaving a taut silence and a continuing ringing in her ears. \"Last chance,\" he said. \"It\u0027s a limited time offer.\" \"No,\" she said. \"I don\u0027t want to know what you see.\" Kavanaugh sighed and shook his head. \"Right,\" he said. \"Let\u0027s get her upstairs - \" It was all falling apart. He wouldn\u0027t balk at putting bullets in their heads and burying them out in the desert. And she loathed that salacious gleam in his eyes when he\u0027d talked about the pictures. About being in her head. She avoided Stewart\u0027s grabbing hand, let her knees collapse, and fell sideways. Her elbow smacked down hard on the EMP device, on the green button. \"No!\" Kavanaugh screamed, but it was too late. There wasn\u0027t a buildup and there wasn\u0027t a warning. It fired. There was a smell of frying circuitry, cracks and pops, and every electronic circuit within a thousand feet went dead. Including the lights. Lucia rolled, banged into Stewart and sent him stumbling; he fired blind. By the muzzle flash, she got a snapshot of where everyone was standing, and she kicked both feet up, catching Stewart hard in the groin and lifting him literally off the ground. He hit the wall and screamed in high-pitched agony. She slithered backward in that direction and felt his gun on the floor, grabbed it in her cuffed hands and twisted on her knees. Another muzzle flash, and something like a sledgehammer struck her in the chest. A hit, low and on the right. The afterimage showed her that the two men with Kavanaugh had their guns out. Kavanaugh, preternaturally quick, was already through the door. She braced herself for the pain, cocked her elbows, and fired without letting herself think. The recoil slammed up through her arms, hard enough to make her cry out, but she didn\u0027t let it stop her. Two shots, directed to the positions where she\u0027d seen the two men. She heard one hit the floor. The other staggered, then went down. She struggled to her feet, sweating and light-headed. It was unnaturally silent, with not even the air vents working in the room. She hit the glass doors with her shoulder, praying that the locks hadn\u0027t been reset, and saw Kavanaugh rounding the corner up ahead. He\u0027d be getting help, and she was handicapped, gun held behind her back. With Jazz and Ben out of action, she didn\u0027t have a hope in hell... And then Kavanaugh backed up, looking as if he\u0027d seen a ghost. And maybe he had. Max Simms came into view. He was armed with what looked like one of Jazz\u0027s guns, and in that moment, Lucia wondered if they\u0027d all been taken for a ride by the frail-old-man act, because the expression in his eyes...she\u0027d never seen anything like it. Power. Terrible power. \"Endgame,\" Simms said. \"Your move, Gil.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/devil-s-due-red-letter-days-2/page-17.html","bookId":2311,"book":{"id":2311,"title":"Devil\u0027s Due (Red Letter Days #2)","description":"Storyline: Devil\u0027s Due (Red Letter Days #2) The money Lucia and her new partner received to open their detective agency had come with strings: any assignment delivered via red envelope had to be top priority.
