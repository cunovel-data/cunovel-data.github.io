{"id":95657,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"She fell asleep on the couch and woke up to a conviction that there was somebody in her apartment.\n And she didn\u0027t move. Wait, she told herself. Listen. She heard the steady, near-silent tick of the silver clock on the table, the whisper of the air conditioner, indistinct ghosts of noises from outside the windows...\n And there, the scuff of shoes on carpet. The creak of leather as someone shifted weight.\n She opened her eyes and stared hard at the window in front of her, focusing on reflections. Something dark moving behind the couch.\n Lucia slid the.38 out of her robe pocket with a slow, gentle pull, trying to make it look like the natural movement of a sleeper. He hadn\u0027t come closer yet, but she couldn\u0027t let him see the gun. If he shot first...\n She made her decision and rolled off the couch, gun held flat, aiming up at an angle where she knew his head would be. Her injured arm screamed in pain, and she flinched, nearly dropped the gun.\n Nearly.\n \"Easy, my lovely. I\u0027m not armed.\"\n A male voice, low and faintly accented. Eastern European. She recognized it a split second before the moonlight revealed a pale face, thick dark hair, a goatee and mustache. Gregory Valentin Ivanovich. Madre de Dios...\n The last time she\u0027d seen Gregory had been outside a rundown, abandoned factory near Prague, and he\u0027d been shooting over her head to make her escape look good. She\u0027d been barely alive, barely together...and some of that had been his doing, too. She couldn\u0027t forget the cold purpose when he\u0027d told her to run for her life Or he\u0027d have no choice but to make his shots count.\n \"Gregory,\" she said, and tried to slow down the panicked hammering of her heart. \"If you start off with a lie, that just continues the same old cycle of disappointment between us.\" Her voice shook only a little.\n He smiled and leaned on the back of the couch. His hands were empty. Gregory had always favored black, and he was drowning in it today - a black knit shirt under a black leather jacket, black slacks. The only hint of color to him was his hazel eyes, and a thin red scar along one high cheekbone.\n She remembered the scar. She remembered giving it to him, a wild and lucky swing with a piece of broken glass in the dark. And he\u0027d looked down at her, chambered a round in his Glock, and said, \"Dorogaya, you must still have fight left in you, if you can do that. Good. You will need it.\"\n He smiled at her now, and she remembered that, too.\n \"Very well,\" he acknowledged. \"I am armed. But, my lovely, we\u0027re both always armed. It\u0027s understood. It would be impolite to assume anything else.\"\n \"Wouldn\u0027t want that.\" Was she having some kind of fever dream? It would make sense. Half of her worst nightmares featured glimpses of Gregory Valentin Ivanovich. The trouble was, so did half of her other dreams. It was...complicated, yes. Very complicated.\n His eyes shifted and focused on her right arm. He couldn\u0027t have seen the bandage through the robe, but he would have seen the flinch, and the weakness. \"Are you injured?\"\n \"Grazed.\"\n \"Ah. Yes, I followed the afternoon\u0027s heroics. Very stirring.\" He shrugged. \"Very stupid.\"\n \"Thanks. So would you care to explain how you come to be in my apartment without an invitation?\"\n \"Would you care to get off the floor while we discuss it?\" he asked, raising those thick eyebrows.\n No point in keeping the gun on him; Gregory would do as Gregory pleased, consequences be damned. She nodded and stood up, cinching her robe tight again and dropping the gun back in her pocket. \"I\u0027m assuming this isn\u0027t a social call,\" she said. \"Since social calls don\u0027t usually require breaking into a person\u0027s apartment in the middle of the night.\"\n \"Yes. High-security apartment, very nice. I approve. I have one like it in Chicago, you know, only mine has a better view.\" No point in asking how he\u0027d defeated that security either; he\u0027d just smile and ignore the question. He\u0027d defeated it the same way she would have, by simple and logical steps, and a terrifying amount of innate ability. She\u0027d have to go over it later, trace back his modes of entry, see how he\u0027d bypassed the systems...\n \"Dorogaya? Are you with me?\"\n She felt a hot burn of embarrassment that he\u0027d seen the lapse. Damn. It wouldn\u0027t do to show him weakness. \"Get to the point.\"\n He pushed away from the couch, crossed his arms and walked to the wing chair nearest the windows. He settled in, legs apart, watching her. He nodded to the couch. She sat, knees together, hand still in the pocket of her robe. Just in case.\n \"You know, of course, who I work for?\" he asked.\n \"That depends.\"\n \"On...?\"\n \"What day of the week it is, and your mood.\"\n He laughed. A good, warm chuckle. His eyes never wavered, and the wolf in them remained unamused. \"My dear Lushenka, I cannot believe they let you quit the business. What an asset you were. So amusing. But yes, you are right, of course, I have been known to be...less than consistent, since Mother Russia turned me out as a whore. To answer your question, today I work for the Cross Society.\"\n \"Lovely. We\u0027re coworkers. What do you want?\"\n He tapped a finger on the curling edge of his smile. \"There is a need for secrecy.\"\n \"Meaning what, exactly? You know something I don\u0027t?\"\n \"I know many things you don\u0027t, zolotaya. Many, many things. For instance, I know that you will get another red envelope tomorrow.\"\n She said nothing to that. He might very well know it to be true.\n \"I also know that tomorrow, the Cross Society has arranged that someone close to you will die. Possibly you do not care that your new friend - her name is Jasmine, yes? - suffers an accident, but I know you well enough to know that you do care about your own survival. I have seen in the past how hard you will fight for it.\"\n \"How do you know what\u0027s going to happen tomorrow?\"\n He shrugged. \"How does any of this become known? They tell me. Simms tells them, or they calculate it on their little machines. I don\u0027t know which it is and I don\u0027t want to know. The process is unimportant. What is important is that their information is rarely wrong.\"\n \"And they sent you to tell me this.\"\n He didn\u0027t answer.\n \"They didn\u0027t send you. You came on your own.\" She felt something curdle in the pit of her stomach, \"What\u0027s going on?\"\n \"A very large game. A game of the world, and men trying to control it. Villains and heroes, but my love, which are you? Do you know?\" He shook his head. \"You stop a killer here, abet a killer there. It\u0027s no different than the game you hated before. Don\u0027t you see?\"\n \"We stopped a child killer not long ago. We stopped a pair of potential mass murderers today. I wouldn\u0027t say we\u0027re not doing good.\"\n \"Yes, of course. There should be statues in the square in your honor. But you have no idea how small your victories are, or how many killers the Society decides not to stop, for its own purposes. Once you play God, how do you decide where to halt? Who to kill? Who to allow to live?\" He gave another shrug, this one more heartfelt. \"This is why I go where I am told, and where I am paid. It is easier than trying to be moral and upright.\" In his own way, Gregory Ivanovich was pouring out his heart. Lucia sat very still, listening, watching him, not quite believing the experience. His hand had, after all, been on plenty of triggers; he\u0027d seen more than enough cruelty and blind stupidity in his life. He\u0027d been lauded, and betrayed, often enough to be realistic and cynical about both.\n He\u0027d stood in the dark and hurt her for money, once upon a time. And then he\u0027d cut her bonds and whispered in her ear, \"Run for your life,\" and fired over her head...\n \"What are you trying to tell me?\" she asked. Her voice, despite her best efforts, wouldn\u0027t stay steady.\n \"I have told you. Unless you take steps to prevent it, someone close to you will be killed tomorrow. And sooner or later, it will be your turn. You are a Lead, they tell you, and yes, there is importance to what you do, or do not do. But not only importance. Power. And power corrupts what it touches.\"\n \"I don\u0027t - \"\n \"You and your partner, Jasmine. You become one of the key points on which events turn. And you can\u0027t be controlled. They are learning this. It is not a lesson they like.\"\n The sick feeling in her stomach grew worse. \"And if we can\u0027t be controlled...\"\n \"This is about power. Power requires control.\" Gregory put his hands flat on the arms of his chair and settled down in it more comfortably. His eyes fell half-shut, and his smile - she remembered it. Remembered that rare expression of approval.\n \"The Cross Society wants us dead? But the Society put Jazz and me together in the first place! We never would have met if - \"\n \"My beloved, you\u0027re not that stupid. They put you together for a reason. Now they want to take you apart for a reason. You\u0027re just tools to them. And given our similar histories, I\u0027m surprised that you didn\u0027t consider that from the beginning.\"\n She was silent, staring at him. Aware of a lot of things, suddenly - of the fever still burning inside of her, a heavy feeling in her lungs, the carefully hidden trail behind the FedEx that had delivered something deadly to her offices. It could have been Eidolon, trying to throw suspicion on the Cross Society. It could just as easily have been the Cross Society using a double-blind. They hadn\u0027t sent it through Borden. Maybe Borden was still too valuable to them. Maybe James Borden, with his heart lost to Jazz Callender, wasn\u0027t going to play their game anymore, especially if it turned deadly for his friends.\n Any of it could be true.\n Or none of it.\n \"So,\" she said after a quiet moment, \"what do I do?\"\n He shrugged. \"I leave that to you. But were I you, and did I care anything for your friend - which I do not, you might note - I would be sure to stay alert during the morning hours of tomorrow. Events would conspire, as they say.\"\n \"Tomorrow morning. It\u0027s that specific.\"\n \"I imagine it\u0027s more specific than that, my love, but that is what I heard. Or, more accurately, overheard.\"\n \"So you\u0027re telling me you came here to warn me out of the kindness of your heart. For old times\u0027 sake.\"\n He laughed. Not a chuckle this time, a full-throated bray of amusement. \"Oh!\" he gasped, when he got some control again. \"Oh, zolotaya, you never fail to amaze me. You know what zolotaya means, yes?\"\n \"Gold.\"\n \"In Russia, wealth is endearment, and you, my zolotaya, are beyond measure. I\u0027ve always wondered if you would marry me someday. Would you?\"\n \"No.\"\n \"As I thought. I am bereft.\" He stood up, and she got to her feet as well. The important thing with Gregory, as with all beautiful wild animals, was to never take your eyes off him. \"Will you let me tell you one last thing?\"\n \"I don\u0027t see how I can stop you.\"\n \"I don\u0027t think they want you dead yet, although I think soon they will. No, I think they want you frightened, and alone, so that you will do what they say. I don\u0027t think they understand what a silly hope this is.\"\n \"They don\u0027t know me,\" she said.\n For just a moment, there was something other than the wolf in those beautiful eyes. \"That is entirely their loss,\" he said, and the comic-opera Russian was gone. \"Take care. I\u0027ve done as much as I can for you without inconveniencing my own plans.\"\n That was as much truth as she could ever hope to expect. She inclined her head slightly. He bowed his a fraction less.\n And then he left.\n She sank down on the couch, not bothering to lock the door after him - there didn\u0027t seem much point - and thought about things one more time.\n Sometime in the middle of it, unexpectedly and without drama, her body simply decided that it had had quite enough of the stress, and sent her into a deep and dreamless sleep. She didn\u0027t know how long it lasted - not long enough for morning to arrive, at any rate - and she woke to the insistent electronic tones of a ringing phone.\n It was Manny.\n The anthrax culture was positive, and Jazz was on her way over.\n Lucia was dressed when Jazz arrived, and was putting her hair up in a ponytail to keep it out of her face. It was a practical habit she\u0027d developed over the years, a sort of ritual for going into battle. And she knew it was a battle now, whether that was likely to be obvious or not. She had just put on her shoulder holster when the bell rang.\n \"No way,\" Jazz said flatly when Lucia opened the door. \"You\u0027ve got to be fucking kidding. You think you\u0027re actually going somewhere, other than to the hospital? Manny called, didn\u0027t he? You were supposed to pack a bag.\"\n \"Sit. I have things to tell you.\"\n Jazz didn\u0027t, but Lucia wasn\u0027t in any mood to wait for compliance. She started with the red envelope on the counter - Simms\u0027s creepy note of gratitude - and saw a flash of genuine irritation come over Jazz\u0027s face. Of course. She\u0027s the one who pulled the trigger. Why would he thank me?\n But when comment came, it wasn\u0027t about the details. \"I got one, too,\" Jazz said. \"Courier brought it. You wouldn\u0027t believe the full-out paranoid lockdown that went into effect when Manny saw the van drive up.\"\n Lucia could only imagine, and shook her head in wonder.\n Jazz was still frowning at her. \"Look, that doesn\u0027t explain you being out of bed and ready to rumble, okay? If there\u0027s any work that needs to be done, I\u0027m doing it. Not you. You\u0027re flat on your back for the duration, getting good IV antibiotics. Doctor\u0027s orders.\"\n \"Not yet. I\u0027ve got things to tell you - \"\n \"Sit. Down.\"\n Lucia put up her hands and sat. And truthfully, she hadn\u0027t slept well, or woken up that way, either. She still felt hot and sore, but at least the tickle in the back of her throat had died to a memory, and her lungs seemed clear. Surely she\u0027d be worse, if this was going to go badly.\n \"Jazz,\" she said. Her partner brushed shag-cut blond hair back from her eyes and bustled around the kitchen, bitching about overpriced, overcomplicated appliances. Her black T-shirt was tucked in and clung to her curves; whether Jazz recognized it or not, she had a gorgeous, elegant line to her. Broad shoulders, curving hips, a not inconsiderable bustline. More than that, she just looked...strong. Strong and - now that she\u0027d abandoned the ill-fitting men\u0027s flannel shirts and baggy jeans - female, without being in the least feminine.\n \"This thing\u0027s broken,\" Jazz said mutinously, staring at the high-tech coffeemaker. Jazz preferred one-button models. Lucia was reasonably certain that hers could navigate a spacecraft to Mars, if adequately programmed.\n \"No, it isn\u0027t,\" she said. \"It\u0027s just temperamental. Jazz, I need you to listen to me for a minute.\"\n Her partner paused in the act of spooning grounds into the filter. \"Yeah?\"\n \"Something happened last night.\"\n \"McCarthy brought you home.\" Jazz snapped the filter basket shut and punched buttons. Nothing happened. She slapped the coffeemaker with an open palm, frowning. Lucia sighed, got up and pressed the right button. The machine began a soft chuffing. \"Yeah, I know. You can skip the details.\"\n \"No. No, Ben - didn\u0027t stay. He just saw me home. Something else happened.\"\n \"What?\"\n \"I had an unexpected visitor.\"\n That drew Jazz\u0027s total attention. \"Here? I mean, I know it\u0027s not Manny\u0027s Fortress of Solitude, but it\u0027s got ambassadorial security. Who?\"\n How could she explain it, exactly? \"It was someone I once knew. His name is Gregory Valentin Ivanovich - \"\n \"I remember the name. You saw it in the files about the Cross Society.\"\n Lucia blinked. \"What?\"\n \"The first day we were in Borden\u0027s office, and you jimmied the lock on his file drawer. Ivanovich\u0027s name was on a list of people employed by the Cross Society. You said he was somebody you recognized.\"\n She barely remembered it. Jazz, it seemed, had a rare gift for memory. \"Gregory came to warn me that the Cross Society means to set us up. Set you up, I mean. This morning.\"\n Jazz took it with a shocking lack of surprise, and a shrug. \"I don\u0027t doubt it,\" she muttered, and came to sit next to Lucia. \"I\u0027m not exactly a good little soldier. I mean, come on. Wouldn\u0027t they rather have people who follow orders, in something this complicated? You start knowing too much - \"\n \"You start questioning the right and wrong of things. Like we\u0027ve already done.\"\n \"Like Borden does, too.\" Jazz frowned at the coffee-maker, which didn\u0027t really deserve it, since it was doing its job. \"That\u0027s why you\u0027re strapped? Because you think our buddies at the red envelope factory are out to get me?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"L., I\u0027ve been assuming that from the very beginning,\" she said. \"Makes no difference if one of your oh-so-mysterious ex-boyfriends shows up to point a spotlight at it.\"\n Lucia smiled wearily. \"The only difference is that he was very precise about it being this morning.\"\n \"You trust this guy?\"\n She considered that very carefully. \"In certain specifics, yes. And I think he was telling me the truth as he knew it.\"\n Jazz raised her eyebrows. \"Huh. That sounds not very convincing.\" She looked toward the coffeemaker, which had started filling the carafe. \"That thing have a sensor so you can take the pot out and it won\u0027t pee all over the burner?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"Figures.\" Jazz filled two cups and put the carafe back in place. The machine continued its puffing, hissing work. She carried the cups over and handed Lucia one. \"Listen to me, okay? I don\u0027t care what kind of doomful signs of the apocalypse are on the horizon. You\u0027re going into the hospital and you\u0027re going to rest. End of story. Now go take off the gun and pack your bag. Consider me forewarned. You know for damn sure I\u0027m always forearmed.\"\n Lucia eyed the time. It was going on 9:00 a.m. now, and Gregory had been quite specific. Morning. Assuming he had been truthful, and that came down to her instincts.\n \"I\u0027ll stay with you until noon,\" she said. \"No negotiations, chica. I mean it. I\u0027m not letting you run around un-chaperoned. Three hours won\u0027t make any difference. They can strap me to the bed and give me whatever they want this afternoon.\"\n \"Lucia...\"\n Jazz, she saw, was close to exasperation. Lucia reached across and captured her hand. Jazz\u0027s fingers were slack with surprise.\n \"You shot someone yesterday,\" Lucia said. \"The second man in a few weeks.\"\n Jazz\u0027s eyes flew up to meet hers. \"What the hell does that have to do with anything?\"\n \"Is that why you\u0027re mother-henning me?\"\n \"No, dammit, I\u0027m mother-henning you because you need it! Because you - you did the same thing for me. Remember?\"\n She did. She remembered Jazz, white around the lips, barely able to move after surgery to remove a bullet, determined to try to go about the business of her life.\n She stared at Jazz for long seconds, and then said, \"My life is my own, Jazz. As is yours. But please, let me do this one thing before I give up control. All right?\"\n Jazz swallowed, looked away and nodded. \"We keep it to a minimum, then. Far as I\u0027m concerned, we don\u0027t do anything that puts either one of us in danger. We can hang out here and watch TV until noon - \"\n The telephone rang. Jazz\u0027s eyes went dark and shadowed, and she grabbed it before Lucia could reach for it. \"Yeah,\" she snapped. Her body language shifted, from resistant to cautiously open. \"For me? You\u0027re sure? Okay. I\u0027ll be right down.\"\n She hung up and looked at Lucia, who frowned. \"Down for what?\"\n \"Delivery. FedEx, for me.\"\n \"Let\u0027s consider the last FedEx I opened, shall we? Carefully.\"\n \"It\u0027s like the lotto. Can\u0027t win if you don\u0027t play.\" Jazz grabbed her jacket and swung it on to hide her shoulder holster. \"You stay here. I\u0027ll be right back. No fair having ninja fights while I\u0027m gone or anything.\"\n Jazz was gone before she could protest. Lucia, resigned, went to the intercom and buzzed the security desk. \"Mr. Tarrant? My friend is on the way down. I want extra attention while she\u0027s coming and going, all right? There could be trouble.\"\n \"Yes, ma\u0027am,\" he said. \"We\u0027ll keep a close eye.\"\n That was all she could do to protect Jazz at the moment. She pulled out a small carry bag and stuffed in sweatpants, underwear, tank tops, comfortable soft things that wouldn\u0027t bother her if - as she anticipated - the doctors did indeed tie her down for the duration. The bathroom necessities went into the side pockets, and after a second she put in the collapsible combat baton that Jazz had given her as a partnership gift, and professional-strength pepper spray. She\u0027d have to surrender the offensive weaponry, but...\n She heard the front door open and close, and made her way back that direction. Jazz was standing there, frowning.\n \"You\u0027re not gonna like it.\" Jazz held up the FedEx envelope and removed a red envelope with the air of an actress about to announce an award.\n \"You\u0027ve got to be kidding me.\"\n \"Yeah, I wish I was. But I checked it out with your little light thingie.\" Jazz handed it over. \"It\u0027s to both of us.\"\n It read, IMPERATIVE YOU GO IMMEDIATELY TO THE RAPHAEL WHEN YOU RECEIVE THIS MESSAGE. TAKE MS. GARZA.\n \"So much for our plan to stay put,\" Jazz said. \"Didn\u0027t you stash Susannah Davis there?\"\n \"Yes. But there\u0027s no need for us to go. Omar\u0027s with her.\"\n They exchanged silent stares, and Jazz nodded. \"Call him.\"\n She dialed Omar\u0027s cell number. It rang to voice mail. She hung up and dialed the hotel\u0027s main desk and was put through to the room.\n No answer.\n She didn\u0027t have to say anything. Jazz\u0027s face was grim with understanding.\n \"You think - \" Lucia began.\n \"I\u0027 in trying not to.\" Jazz looked down at the paper Lucia was still holding. \"I can get Ben to go with me.\"\n \"No. If anybody goes with you, it\u0027s me. I told you, Ivanovich said there was an explicit threat.\" Lucia got up, retrieved the UV light and ran it over the message. It was signed, again, by Max Simms. \"Simms sent this, not Laskins. You tell me, does he want you alive or dead?\"\n \"Who the hell knows what that creepy guy wants? Look, you\u0027re not going. And if you\u0027re not going and I\u0027m not going, what are we going to do? Hide here like a couple of rabbits?\" Jazz looked fierce, in fighting mode. Razor-edged and glittering with menace. \"I don\u0027t hide.\"\n There was a strange joy in it. And it was catching, driving back the sickness and leaving purpose in its place. \"You\u0027re right.\" Lucia checked her purse for its usual load of lethal supplies. \"Both of us go. You can put me in intensive care at noon.\"\n Jazz looked wary. \"You\u0027re not going to let me stop you, are you?\"\n \"Laughable. Would you let me stop you?\"\n Jazz\u0027s jaw worked, chewing words, and then she spat them out, rapid-fire. \"Fine. You so much as flutter an eyelid, I\u0027m calling an ambulance, and you get carted out like a little old lady who slipped in the shower.\" That was Jazz\u0027s way of expressing affection.\n \"I\u0027m fine. Quit staring like you expect me to fall over and froth at the mouth. I\u0027m not contagious, and I feel all right. I\u0027m not impaired.\" The gnawing headache hardly counted. The heavy tickle in her lungs could be nothing more than suggestion, she told herself. \"As I recall, I let you go along on our first case together when you still had a bullet wound. So please, let\u0027s not discuss fitness.\"\n \"Lucia!\" Jazz grabbed her by the shoulders. Lucia instinctively brought her forearms straight up and knocked the grip loose, which startled them both. \"Damn. I\u0027m not trying to beat you down, you know.\"\n \"I know. It\u0027s been - an odd couple of days. I\u0027m sorry.\"\n \"You\u0027re entitled.\" Jazz stepped back, but she hadn\u0027t lost the frown. Her hands were fisted at her sides now. \"Look, this is serious. We could be walking into anything. I need you sharp. You could walk into a bullet the second you open the door. You really ready for that?\"\n \"Yes.\" Lucia met and held the stare. \"I\u0027m ready, Jazz. I\u0027ve got your back.\"\n Whatever Jazz saw, it seemed to satisfy her. She reached into her black leather jacket, took out her gun and checked the clip - an automatic reaction for her, like breathing.\n Lucia bent over to put on her shoe; Jazz raised an eyebrow. \"That\u0027s what you\u0027re wearing? You know, I always think practical when I\u0027m planning for some kind of fight.\"\n Lucia nodded and reached down to zip the sides of the low boots. \"These are practical. Flat heels, ankle support and steel toes. And yet stylish.\"\n \"Huh. I need to take you shoe shopping.\" Jazz glanced down at her Doc Martens, which looked exactly like the work boots they were. Lucia gave her a full smile and checked the position of her.38 in the holster at the small of her back, then took out the nine millimeter resting in the shoulder holster. Jazz mimed a desire to see it. Lucia handed it over.\n \"Wow,\" she said, and turned it right, then left. \"Ruger P95? This new?\"\n \"Absolutely.\" Lucia reached out and took it from Jazz\u0027s hand, then slotted it securely in her holster. \"You know, you\u0027re amazingly easy to distract with things that can hurt people.\" She donned her leather jacket - brown, not black; she hated to match her partner - and picked up her purse. \"After you, Jazz.\"\n \"You\u0027re sure you - \"\n \"We\u0027ve been through this.\" Lucia met her eyes levelly. \"I put Omar there, and I didn\u0027t think to warn him. Consider how that feels.\"\n Jazz didn\u0027t blink, and for seconds, Lucia thought she\u0027d failed. She knew she wasn\u0027t likely to be able to take Jazz in a straight fight - Jazz had a gift - but she\u0027d been hoping that she wouldn\u0027t have to try.\n \"Fine,\" Jazz abruptly said. \"But one cough out of you, and you\u0027re at the hospital. In restraints. And I tell them you need a colonoscopy, too.\"\n \"Deal.\"\n It was inevitable, Lucia realized, that after a pronouncement like that, she\u0027d fight the urge to cough the entire way down in the elevator. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/devil-s-due-red-letter-days-2/page-11.html","bookId":2311,"book":{"id":2311,"title":"Devil\u0027s Due (Red Letter Days #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Devil\u0027s Due (Red Letter Days #2) \n The money Lucia and her new partner received to open their detective agency had come with strings: any assignment delivered via red envelope had to be top priority.
