{"id":95655,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"Susannah stood very still, staring at Lucia, and then slowly lowered the gun. As if she\u0027d used the last of her strength to hold it up, she collapsed to her knees.\n Omar started to move forward, then stopped and looked back at Lucia. \"Maybe you should - \"\n \"I\u0027ll help her.\" She nodded, and moved in to slowly bend down and pull the gun from the woman\u0027s unresisting hand. Omar relaxed. Lucia handed the weapon to him and leaned down to take Susannah\u0027s weight on her shoulder. The woman was heavier than she looked. Solid muscle. She seemed out of it; Lucia took the opportunity to do a quick pat-down, but found no additional weapons.\n \"He might have tracked her here,\" Omar said. \"Maybe wasn\u0027t looking to hire you at all, just got caught following her and decided to try to make the best of it.\"\n \"Very possible.\"\n \"Could be trying to get down here to the parking level.\"\n \"That\u0027ll take a while,\" Lucia said. \"But let\u0027s not get cocky. Open up the track, help me get her inside.\"\n He moved. Together, they got Susannah into the SUV and belted her in. Omar fired up the engine and cruised up the ramp toward sunlight.\n As they exited into the white-hot glare, Omar said, \"Bend over, Mrs. Davis. Head down. If he\u0027s out here, I don\u0027t want him getting a look at you.\"\n Susannah slowly, painfully hunched over. Lucia scanned the street through the tinted windows and paused on a green Ford Expedition parked a block away. The engine was idling, and she was almost sure the indistinct figure in the driver\u0027s seat was wearing a red baseball cap.\n Son of a bitch.\n They cruised by. Omar didn\u0027t even look toward the other truck, but Lucia was sure he\u0027d noted it. Unless Davis changed vehicles, he wouldn\u0027t be able to follow undetected.\n \"Okay,\" Omar said, and reached over to help Susannah back to a sitting position. She rested her head against the upholstery, whimpering slightly. Omar\u0027s gaze met Lucia\u0027s in the rearview mirror. \"Hey, boss lady. You know a friendly doctor?\"\n \"As a.matter of fact, I do,\" she said. \"Turn right - \"\n \"No doctors,\" Susannah croaked. \"I\u0027m fine. Nothing\u0027s broken.\"\n \"At least we can get you some painkillers - \"\n \"I\u0027m used to it,\" she said, and straightened up. Her slurred voice sounded stronger. \"Thanks, but no. No doctors. I\u0027ll be okay.\"\n \"You could have a concussion.\"\n \"No doubt about it,\" Susannah said, with a grimace that might have been meant as a smile. \"I was looking for you. Well, your firm, anyway. This detective, he said - \"\n \"Welton Brown?\"\n \"Yeah. I need protection. He said I should talk to you guys. I didn\u0027t want - I couldn\u0027t say anything about my husband. Not to the police.\"\n Lucia exchanged another look with Omar, who turned left at the light, heading for the freeway. \"Detective Brown also talked to your husband.\"\n \"Yes,\" she said, and let her head drop back against the upholstery again. \"The story is that I was attacked by a mugger. That\u0027s what he told them. I had no choice. I had to agree.\"\n \"Because?\" Lucia asked. Susannah painfully turned toward her.\n \"Because I already tried going to the police,\" she said. \"All that happened was that when he got out, which took a grand total of less than thirty days for all three arrests, he took it out on me. I\u0027ve moved. Hell, I moved here from New Mexico. Look what it got me. You don\u0027t know him. You don\u0027t know what he does for a living.\"\n Tears shone hard silver in her eyes again, and she blinked them back.\n \"I need help,\" she said. \"I need time to decide what to do. I have money. I can pay you.\"\n \"If you need to disappear, there are shelters - \"\n \"He knows all about them. Believe me, he\u0027s an expert at this, and he\u0027s got people working for him. They\u0027ll find me. I have to use my ID and social security number to get a new job, a new apartment - he catches up. I need somebody who can get me a new life.\" Susannah\u0027s breath hitched unevenly, and she shifted, eyes shutting against some inner pain. \"I know things. Things that can put him in prison forever. I just need - I need some time to think about it. Make plans. A few days. I wasn\u0027t lying - I have money. I\u0027ll pay you whatever you ask, just keep me safe and hidden for a while. Please.\"\n Lucia stared straight ahead, thinking. She had contacts who could provide new ID, forged documents, clean social security numbers. Once Susannah\u0027s face healed, Lucia had people who could even provide her with some subtle plastic surgery to change the contours of her face. Make her plain or pretty, but different.\n Those were contacts she hadn\u0027t used in years. A part of her life she\u0027d hoped she\u0027d never have to acknowledge again. But that life had made her what she was now, the way broken bones sometimes mended stronger.\n \"Maybe,\" she said. \"First priority is to take you someplace safe, so you can rest. You look ready to collapse.\"\n Lucia settled back in the seat, took out her phone and called Jazz.\n Omar made the last two turns and slowed the SUV. It was a bleak industrial area, all solid blocks of buildings with grimed windows and blank concrete faces. He slowed to a crawl in the middle of the block. \"There?\"\n It was a warehouse, just like the rest. Three stories, windows on the top floor and a blank front below with three roll-up doors, all rusted and apparently securely fastened.\n \"That\u0027s it.\"\n \"So how do we get in, exactly?\"\n \"Pull up to the door.\"\n He turned the SUV up the incline and to an idling stop at the bay door. Nothing happened.\n \"And?\" he asked.\n \"Wait\"\n They waited. After three or four minutes of silence, the bay door began to move upward - not slow and creaking, as you would have guessed from the looks of it, but smooth and silent, and much faster than a typical garage door.\n \"Go. Manny won\u0027t keep it open long.\" And true to her word, the door began to crank back down when the SUV was halfway through. Omar swore and hit the gas, and even so the door barely missed the back bumper of the truck. \"Park under the light.\"\n There was a single working light on the ground level, illuminating a patch of bare concrete floor. Everything else was in inky darkness, except for the slight suggestion of a staircase over to the side. Omar pulled the truck up as instructed and put it in Park.\n \"Engine off,\" an amplified voice ordered, loudly enough to penetrate the closed windows of the SUV. Omar shot Lucia an amused, questioning look, and she nodded for him to follow instructions. She rolled down her window, and Omar did the same.\n \"Manny!\" she called. \"It\u0027s Lucia!\"\n \"I can see that.\" He didn\u0027t sound pleased, not pleased at all. Manny Glickman, on his own ground, seemed a lot more commanding. \"And before you even ask, the answer\u0027s no.\"\n \"Manny - \"\n \"No. Sorry. Can\u0027t come inside.\"\n Omar opened his door and stepped out, looking around. Lucia sighed and got out, too, walking around to join him. He didn\u0027t seem very impressed. \"This is it?\"\n \"No,\" she said. \"Believe me, there\u0027s a lot more to it than this. Manny, can\u0027t we just come upstairs and talk about it?\"\n \"Too many people.\"\n \"I can vouch for Omar - \"\n \"No room at the inn, Lucia. Sorry, but that\u0027s how it is.\"\n The last of that was delivered in person, an echoing voice from the bottom of the stairs. He shuffled out of the shadows and into the pool of light, looking different from the man who\u0027d taken charge back at the office yesterday. He slumped, which spoiled what might have been an otherwise impressive entrance. Having Pansy in his life had been a good influence, but he was still phobic, still flinched at loud, unexpected noises, and he did not enjoy company. Having Lucia, Omar and a strange woman on his virtual doorstep wasn\u0027t waking any innate feelings of hospitality.\n \"Look,\" he said, \"I like you, okay? I like you fine. You come alone, you\u0027re welcome. You call for help, I do what I can. But you\u0027re coming to my house right now without asking first, and look, you brought people. I need you to go.\"\n \"This woman\u0027s in trouble. Manny, you have the safest place in the city. Put her up for just a few days - \"\n \"No!\" he snapped, then looked away. \"I\u0027m sorry, but no. I\u0027m not the friggin\u0027 Witness Protection Program, here. I do consulting forensic work. I took in Jazz \u0027cause she\u0027s family. Pansy...\" He tried to come up with a phrase, and failed. \"I\u0027m not running a dorm. I\u0027m out of room.\"\n \"You\u0027re kidding,\" Omar said, and looked at the size of the ground floor. \"Upstairs has to be a couple hundred thousand square feet.\"\n \"No.\"\n Lucia held up a hand - not to Manny, to Omar. \"It\u0027s all right,\" she said. \"Manny, it\u0027s your space, I completely understand and respect that. I was asking for a favor. You can choose not to give it. That\u0027s all right.\"\n Manny flush faded from hot rose to a dull pink. \"I can\u0027t. I can\u0027t have strangers here right now. Please, Lucia. I need you to go away.\"\n His gaze kept moving from Lucia to Susannah in the SUV, irresistibly drawn, and then snapping back as if what he saw frightened him. It probably did. Manny had some bad, bad images in his head, and a trauma that had hardwired him against ever risking himself again. He didn\u0027t like criminal cases, avoided them at all costs, and he put his personal security ahead of most everything else. Including, sometimes, his friends.\n Still, he seemed uncomfortable at Lucia\u0027s silence. \"I don\u0027t mean to be - look, I\u0027m sorry. I know she needs help. But - Lucia, I can\u0027t.\" His green eyes held hers, willing her to understand. \"I can\u0027t.\"\n \"I know,\" she said. \"I\u0027m sorry, Manny. That\u0027s all right. Can I go up to see Jazz?\"\n \"No.\"\n That, she didn\u0027t expect. \"You\u0027re kidding. Manny? You know me!\"\n He shuffled uncomfortably. \"Okay, come with me. But they stay here.\"\n She sighed, and without even asking - or waiting for Manny to demand it - she pulled her gun out of its holster, made it safe and handed it to Omar. It disappeared into his leather jacket.\n \"I\u0027m all yours,\" she said. \"Omar, Susannah - wait here.\"\n \"And don\u0027t touch anything,\" Manny said. \"I mean it. Anything.\"\n Omar looked around at the utterly featureless space. \"I\u0027ll try to hold back.\"\n Manny led her through pools of harsh industrial light and velvety shadows to a steel door. This one had a keypad. He covered it with his hand and typed in a string of at least a dozen numbers, then opened the door for her. It made a hydraulic hiss. She stepped inside, he crowded in behind her, and they were in - what the hell was this? - a kind of secured room. Presuming somebody got past the security on the previous door, this room would stop them cold. It was about six feet square, and - she rapped the wall - seemed like solid steel, with some vents in the ceiling.\n Manny pointed up. \"I can drop knockout gas,\" he said. \"In emergencies.\"\n \"You scare me sometimes.\"\n \"Yeah, that\u0027s what Jazz says, too. But I\u0027ve never been robbed.\"\n \"I\u0027ll bet.\"\n Manny edged past her to the other end of the room and slid aside a well-concealed metal panel. Inside was another keypad. This sequence was longer, and was probably - knowing Manny - completely different and randomly generated. She thought about Jazz, coming in and out of here, and knew her partner well enough to realize that, regardless of Manny\u0027s instructions, she would have had all of these pass codes written down somewhere. Probably on a sheet of paper labeled Secret Codes.\n That made Lucia smile, thinking of Manny\u0027s probable reaction if he knew. He\u0027d definitely move. Again.\n \"Where are we going?\" she asked. The door opened, and on the other side was an openwork metal staircase. For a man who\u0027d been buried alive, Manny seemed to have an affinity for small spaces - but, she realized, they were small spaces he controlled. It made a certain cockeyed sense.\n \"The office.\"\n \"Is Jazz there?\"\n \"No.\"\n Two flights of stairs, another key-coded door, and she was in another world. The office was a big, spacious place, all windows on one side, with thick, off-white carpeting.\n Modern art hung on the walls, and she could tell instantly that it wasn\u0027t lithography; those were originals. He seemed particularly partial to the cool logic and simplicity of Mondrian, but he was eclectic. She spotted a Kandinsky, then a Miro. The colors glowed in the soft natural light.\n Gradually, she realized that there was furniture, as well - all pale, spare, unobtrusive. A desk with two chairs on either side. A huge expanse of pale oak cabinets.\n \"Wow.\" It was all she could manage. Why was Manny never what she expected? He looked as if he might live behind a sewer grate.\n How in the hell did Manny Glickman, former government employee, have the cash to live like this? Consulting was profitable; it wasn\u0027t that profitable. Then again, she hoped nobody would ever force her to explain the funds in her bank accounts, or the penthouses in New York and Madrid. Even though she\u0027d come by the money legitimately, if not perfectly honestly...\n Manny seemed to relax as he walked to the desk. His shoulders straightened, his muscles loosened. By the time he eased himself into the suede chair behind the desk, he looked only a little worried.\n \"Sit,\" he said. His green eyes were level on her as she silently obeyed. \"Do you have a fever?\"\n It wasn\u0027t what she expected. Again. \"What...? No. No, of course I don\u0027t.\"\n He stood up, took a set of keys out of his pocket and unlocked a desk drawer. She couldn\u0027t quite see what he\u0027d palmed. He walked over and, with deceptive quickness, slapped his hand over her forehead. For a ludicrous instant she thought, That\u0027s it, he\u0027s gone insane, he thinks he\u0027s a faith healer, and then he took his hand away and stared at her forehead intently. She reached up and touched plastic.\n \"Thermometer,\" he said. \"Disposable.\"\n Oh. She put her hands in her lap and waited, wondering idly what the thing was saying. Manny\u0027s expression was unreadable.\n He reached down and peeled it off and mutely turned it to show her. The red line had reached a marker that read 100.2 degrees.\n \"No?\" he asked.\n Her reflex was to snap back I\u0027m fine, but that was stupid, and it was rooted in fear. She swallowed, closed her eyes for a few seconds and considered. She felt hot, but not really sick. Tired. Had a slight ache in the back of her throat.\n \"All right,\" she said calmly. \"I have a fever. Some muscle aches. I could sleep for a week. But Manny, those aren\u0027t necessarily symptoms of anthrax. They\u0027re just as likely to be reactions to stress.\"\n He nodded, dropped the thermometer in the trash and returned to the safety of his chair. He leaned back, still watching her.\n \"You need to rest,\" he said. \"Let the antibiotics work. And go see your doctor, today.\"\n \"You have the results of the tests?\"\n \"The culture\u0027s still cooking.\"\n \"If it\u0027s anthrax, what are my chances?\"\n \"Excellent. You got on antibiotics right away. You just need to take care of yourself.\"\n She took in a slow breath. \"Does Pansy have a fever?\"\n He shook his head, and the tension gathering in her stomach lessened a little.\n \"No symptoms at all?\"\n \"Nothing. I\u0027m watching over her,\" he said, and went quiet again for a few seconds. \"I want to talk to you about Ben McCarthy.\"\n Of course. Manny knew Ben; in fact, he had more loyalty to Ben than anyone except Jazz. \"Go ahead.\"\n \"You can\u0027t trust him.\"\n She sat back, surprised. It clearly cost him to say that; his expression was deeply unhappy.\n \"Don\u0027t get me wrong,\" he added quickly. \"Ben...Ben means a lot to me. I mean, he\u0027s - I wouldn\u0027t be here if it weren\u0027t for Ben. I wouldn\u0027t be anywhere. But - \" She watched him struggle for words, with no impulse to help him along. \"He manipulates people. Women.\"\n She smiled slowly. \"Manny, you\u0027ve just described ninety-five percent of the men I\u0027ve ever met, if you insert the words tries to.\"\n \"No, I mean...\" He ran his hand through his curling dark hair and left it looking just a bit mad-scientist. \"I don\u0027t think he\u0027s telling us everything. There\u0027s something wrong here, Lucia. Jazz doesn\u0027t think so, but I do. You should watch out.\"\n \"It\u0027s all right if you just don\u0027t like him,\" Lucia said. \"You don\u0027t have to, you know. You can owe him your life and still not like him.\"\n Something flickered over Manny\u0027s face.\n \"I died,\" he said quietly, and curled his hands into loose fists on the wooden top of his desk, as if he wanted to keep them from doing anything foolish. \"Seemed like I died, anyway. I was down there in the dark, all that dirt on top of me, running out of air. Screaming until I couldn\u0027t scream anymore, with that tape running, the one of his last victim. He tied me up so I couldn\u0027t breathe much. So that every move I made pulled the rope tighter around my neck. I had a choice - I could lie there quietly and suffocate, or I could try to get loose and strangle.\"\n \"Oh, no, Manny,\" she whispered. She hadn\u0027t known.\n \"Over forty hours. You know what it\u0027s like to run out of air? You get a headache. It just gets worse until it kills you, until you can\u0027t breathe, until you\u0027re nothing but a gagging animal. And when I tried to struggle, the rope was like his hands, like his hands around my throat.\" He swallowed hard and wiped his forehead. \"All my life I thought I was smart, but he showed me that when you\u0027re down in that hole, smart doesn\u0027t mean shit. You need someone else. Someone else. Anyone else.\"\n \"Manny - \"\n \"Ben dug with his bare hands, you know. With his bare hands, while the other cop went to get shovels. I was dead. He gave me mouth-to-mouth to bring me back. I\u0027m alive because he dug me up and made me live.\" Manny raised his eyes and fixed them on hers, fierce and angry. \"Ben\u0027s the hand of God to me. You know how much it costs me to tell you not to trust him? You think I don\u0027t like him? How do you not like someone after that? I love him, and screw your smug attitude!\"\n He was angry. She\u0027d never really seen him angry before - scared, sure, but this was different. He stood up, and she did, too, feeling a little worried. But he stalked over to the door and jerked it open. Made a jerky after-you gesture, head bent. She went to the stairs and walked down them, aware of his bulk behind her. There were no code panels on this side of the barriers. Manny could always get out.\n She opened the last door and stepped into the cool dimness of the parking garage, then turned around. Manny stood right behind her, one hand on the knob, watching her.\n \"I didn\u0027t mean to discount what he did for you,\" she said. \"And if you think I should be careful, then I\u0027ll be careful. Thank you.\"\n He nodded once and slammed the door. The code panel\u0027s red lights lit up.\n No getting back inside.\n She went to the SUV, where Omar lounged against the side, smoking, and Susannah waited in the passenger seat.\n \"Is he going to help?\" Susannah asked anxiously.\n Lucia climbed in the back when Omar opened the door for her. \"No,\" she said.\n Omar flicked a look at her as he started up the truck. She shook her head. She didn\u0027t know how to begin to tell him what had just happened, and she wasn\u0027t sure she should.\n As the big steel door cranked up to let them exit to the street, another car pulled in to block the way from outside.\n James Borden got out of the sedan.\n He evidently realized it was too late to wave at Manny for admittance, and he sure as hell must have thought it was important, because instead of stopping like any sane person as that massive door rattled down, he dashed forward.\n Three feet left. Two and a half...\n Borden dived through the gap, elbow banging on the steel door, and came to his feet in a not-quite-clumsy roll. He didn\u0027t have the animal grace of, say, Jazz, but then again, he had a lot of arms and legs to work with.\n \"Manny!\" he yelled. \"You asshole!\"\n An intercom came on. \"Next time call first.\" That seemed to be that, so far as Manny was concerned. He really wasn\u0027t feeling hospitable.\n Borden brushed imaginary dust from his suit - he was nicely done up today; hopelessly off-the-rack, but he cleaned up well, considering. His hair had the unyielding, gravity-defying gel look that Jazz found so funny.\n Lucia got out and walked toward him. \"Looking for Jazz?\" she asked. It was pretty much a given.\n \"No,\" he said. \"I was looking for you.\"\n And it hardly came as a surprise when he pulled a red envelope from inside his jacket. It was a little creased from his acrobatics.\n \"Let me guess,\" she said, and didn\u0027t move to take it. \"You were told where I\u0027d be.\"\n The tips of his ears turned red. \"Don\u0027t make this hard. I\u0027m just a messenger.\"\n \"Just following orders?\"\n \"Don\u0027t - hey, who\u0027s she?\" Borden\u0027s eyes suddenly shifted to look over Lucia\u0027s shoulder. He was staring at the bruised and abused faced of Susannah, visible through the van\u0027s front window.\n \"Nobody you need to know, unless you\u0027re taking on pro bono criminal cases,\" she said. \"Forgive me for being a little cautious, but the last one of those I got came with a toy prize.\"\n \"I talked to Laskins,\" Borden said, and came a step closer. Just a step, because Omar was watching him with that closed expression that meant trouble. \"This one comes directly from the Society. Nobody\u0027s touched it but me and him. Do you want me to open it?\"\n She\u0027d feel like an idiot. And a coward. She took the envelope, ripped it open and drew out the single sheet of paper inside.\n It said, GET MS. CALLENDER. GO WITH MR. BORDEN. PARK IN THE LOT ON THE SOUTHWEST CORNER OF PARALLEL PARKWAY AND 10TH AT 5:16 P.M. TODAY. LOOK FOR A MAROON CHEVY VAN. WE TRUST YOU WILL KNOW WHAT TO DO.\n \"Hang on,\" Borden said, and handed her something else. It was a tiny flashlight, and when she tried it, the light emerged a cool, faint blue. \"UV,\" he said. \"Shine it on the paper.\"\n When she did, a sprawling signature appeared. Milo Laskins.\n \"From now on,\" Borden stated, \"everything we send you comes marked both on the envelope and on the paper inside. Deal?\"\n \"Deal.\" She stowed the flashlight in the zip case in her purse, which included keys to her house and car, secondary ID and a thousand dollars in cash. The bare necessities of a life that might require running at a moment\u0027s notice. \"Do you know what it says?\"\n \"No.\"\n She handed it over. Borden read it, rubbed his forehead as if he wanted to scrub his frontal lobe, and handed it back. \"Fine,\" he said. \"Why me?\"\n \"I think only your boss can answer that one.\" She turned away from him, toward a corner where she knew a camera was watching, and raised her voice. \"Manny! I need to talk to Jazz!\" She held up the paper.\n After ten seconds of silence, the steel door in the shadows clicked and sighed open.\n \"Just you.\" Manny\u0027s voice rang over the concrete. Then, after a delay: \"And, uh, Borden.\"\n Borden grinned. \"Hey, Jazz.\"\n Jazz\u0027s magnified voice said, \"Hey, Counselor. Get your fine ass up here.\"\n Lucia looked over at Omar, who shrugged and got back into the SUV. \"I have DVD built in,\" he said, and looked at Susannah, who had leaned back with her eyes closed. \"You like Russell Crowe?\"\n \"I just want to sleep.\"\n \"Concussion,\" Omar said. \"No sleeping. Or I take you straight to the hospital.\"\n Susannah opened one eye. The other was swollen to a slit. \"You got Gladiator?\"\n \"A woman of taste.\" Omar gestured for Lucia to go.\n She shut the door, and heard the chunk of locks as he secured it into a minitank.\n Then she followed Borden back upstairs.\n This time Manny guided them by voice, releasing locks remotely. They entered on a different floor, into living quarters. Pansy was lying on the luxurious suede sofa in the middle of the loft, watching a big-screen plasma television. She had a DVD on as well, and Lucia experienced a moment of envy. Pansy looked rosy, clean and relaxed, and was wearing a fluffy white robe. If only I could do the same...\n Pansy scrambled to her feet and brushed her dark bangs out of her eyes when Borden and Lucia passed, as if they\u0027d caught her doing something illegal or unmoral...like resting. Lucia couldn\u0027t hold back a smile. \"As you were, soldier,\" she said. \"Believe me, if I could, I\u0027d pull up a couch next to you, robe and all. And we\u0027d share a gallon of ice cream.\"\n \"You feeling all right?\" Pansy asked anxiously.\n \"I\u0027m fine. Manny says you\u0027re well...?\"\n \"No symptoms.\" Pansy\u0027s pageboy hairdo bobbed vigorously when she nodded. \"Um - shouldn\u0027t you be resting?\"\n \"I will be,\" she said, \"as soon as we take care of some things.\"\n \"Uh-huh.\" Pansy didn\u0027t sound convinced. \"What can I do?\"\n \"You,\" Manny said, coming around a low cubicle wall that Lucia assumed separated off the surveillance equipment, \"can sit down and relax. Right, Lucia?\"\n \"Right.\" She threw them both a quick smile. \"This won\u0027t take long.\" She knew Jazz was going to say, in typical fashion, \"Screw it,\" and toss the message in the shredder.\n Only, of course, Jazz surprised her. First, she was dressed, and well dressed - no badly fitting jeans and floppy sweatshirts today. She\u0027d chosen another pantsuit, this one in dark red, and a tight-fitting white knit shirt. Cute. The shoes were still more or less a disaster; Jazz was never going to give up her flats when there was any chance of having to pursue a bad guy. Then again, she had enough height to pull it off.\n \"Going somewhere?\" Borden asked, and crossed to kiss her. It was an open, intimate kiss, and brought instant bright color to Jazz\u0027s cheeks. \"Or just dressing up for Manny? Should I be jealous?\"\n \"Shut the hell up.\"\n Manny\u0027s living space held a series of temporary partitions in the open warehouse - some low translucent walls, some higher and more private. Lucia let her eyes roam over the entire floor, hunting for something she\u0027d never noticed before - ah, there it was, a door set flush in the wall, with one of those red-lit key code panels. There was another door to his office, from this floor. She\u0027d been wondering. But it made sense, really; Manny would want multiple access points, all under his control.\n Despite the almost Japanese simplicity of the place, Manny\u0027s build-outs, where they existed, were luxurious. The kitchen where Jazz sat could have been lifted from a model home, with wood cabinets and glossy appliances, double steel sinks, and a spacious bar area with high-backed stools.\n Jazz was at the bar, Borden close beside her. Lucia hopped up on a stool next to her. \"Are we finished with the love talk?\" she asked. \"If so, there\u0027s work to be done.\"\n Jazz rolled her eyes and gestured for the red letter, which Borden handed to her. She read it quickly. \"We sure it\u0027s genuine?\"\n \"He says so.\" Lucia demonstrated the new UV toy.\n \"Who\u0027s downstairs?\" Jazz tucked a stray lock of blond hair behind her ear, and read the note again. \"In the truck?\"\n \"Omar and a new client.\"\n \"The wife.\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"No sign of the husband?\"\n \"Omar lost him.\"\n Jazz glanced up at Manny. \"Better have. You wouldn\u0027t believe how he gets if he thinks - \"\n \"Omar lost him,\" Lucia said firmly. \"I\u0027m going to find a place to stash her, and put Omar on bodyguard duty until we can get her in touch with the FBI. She claims she\u0027s got incriminating information about her husband, but she doesn\u0027t want to deal with the local cops. Not even Welton Brown could convince her. The way she talks, it\u0027s probably organized crime. I expect Agent Rawlins will do us another favor, so long as it also looks good on his resume.\"\n Jazz snorted. \"That\u0027s Rawlins, all over. Okay, so this thing. Another typical piece of Cross Society bullshit. Go here, wait here, blah blah. You\u0027ll know what to do? What the hell does that mean?\"\n \"I hope it doesn\u0027t involve shooting someone. Again.\"\n \"Pros and cons,\" Jazz said, and tapped the black marble counter with blunt fingernails. \"Pro, we make a quick five grand for doing whatever this is, and more than likely, it doesn\u0027t even involve us lifting a finger. Most of these don\u0027t, right? We just change events by being there on time.\n We force other people to make different choices. Like a couple of boulders dumped into a stream.\"\n Lucia blinked. \"You understand this better than I do.\"\n \"Yeah, I\u0027m frickin\u0027 deep that way. Any other pros you can think of? Besides money?\"\n \"It\u0027s possible that what we do could help someone. Maybe save a life.\"\n \"Or not. I got over the whole idea that we\u0027re working for the good guys when they sent me to wait outside while a woman got murdered, just so I could write down an apartment number and testify about it later.\"\n Lucia shrugged. \"I said it\u0027s possible.\"\n \"I\u0027ll put that one in the \u0027maybe\u0027 column. Okay, cons. I don\u0027t trust these jerks anymore.\"\n Borden cleared his throat. \"Standing right here, Jazz.\"\n She reached up without looking and put her hand on the lapel of his coat. Her fingers curled, touching his shirt beneath, unconsciously seeking skin. \"Not you,\" she said. \"And we talked about that.\"\n That must have been an interesting conversation, to say the least\n \"There\u0027s something else,\" Lucia said. \"Neither of us wants guilt on our head when people die because we didn\u0027t act.\"\n \"That\u0027s exactly what they want us to think - that it\u0027s somehow our fault. But it isn\u0027t, L. And it isn\u0027t our responsibility, either. We\u0027re not superheroes. Well, I\u0027m not, anyway. I don\u0027t know what the hell you do in your spare time. Me, I bowl. I don\u0027t want to save the world. I just want to work my cases and save my friends and family and people who come to me for help.\"\n Jazz paused and looked down. A cat was prowling around the legs of her bar stool, weaving in and out, purring. Mooch, Lucia recalled. Jazz\u0027s cat. Evidently, Manny didn\u0027t run a no-pets dorm. Jazz leaned down and dragged her fingers down Mooch\u0027s silky-smooth back; he arched into her touch, purring harder, and flicked his high-held tail as he walked away.\n \"He seems to like it here,\" Lucia said.\n \"He\u0027s a cat. What does he know?\" But Jazz was smiling. \"Sorry. Guess I mountaineered up to the soapbox again.\" Lucia hadn\u0027t been confused. She understood very well that this was Jazz venting her frustrations, not Jazz explaining a decision.\n \"I understand perfectly what you\u0027re feeling,\" Lucia said. \"But our choice at the moment is simple. We have a red envelope, and it\u0027s from the Cross Society. What do you want to do?\"\n Jazz sighed. \"Let me get my gun.\"\n She slid off the bar stool and walked to another temporary structure, this one an actual room with four walls and a ceiling, about fifteen feet away across the concrete floor. Her bedroom. Borden followed her. She looked back at him as she opened the door. \"You going to help me get my gun?\" she asked.\n Borden said, \"No, I\u0027m going to help you put on your body armor.\"\n \"Oh. Okay.\"\n The door shut.\n Lucia poured herself a cup of coffee, smiled and waited. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/devil-s-due-red-letter-days-2/page-9.html","bookId":2311,"book":{"id":2311,"title":"Devil\u0027s Due (Red Letter Days #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Devil\u0027s Due (Red Letter Days #2) \n The money Lucia and her new partner received to open their detective agency had come with strings: any assignment delivered via red envelope had to be top priority.
