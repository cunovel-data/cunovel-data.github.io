{"id":95654,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"Morning came ugly and early, with the soundtrack of a ringing phone. Lucia clawed her way out of twisted sheets and found the receiver as she swung her legs out of bed. \"Yes?\" she said. It came out more abrupt than she intended, but she wasn\u0027t a morning person, and nearly everyone who worked with her knew it. What few friends she had knew it extremely well.\\n\\n \"Jazz.\"\\n\\n Lucia collapsed back against the pillows and threw her arm over her eyes. \"Manny has a result.\"\\n\\n \"No, not yet, but I figured I\u0027d better ask you what you wanted to do about today\u0027s appointments. We have clients coming in at ten, remember? Santos Engineering? The industrial espionage thing?\" Jazz was making notes; Lucia could hear the scratch of pen on paper. She felt as if she had a hangover. Her head felt stuffy. Don\u0027t be stupid. It could be anything. You could just be imagining things. \"Lucia?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m thinking,\" she said. \"Any way we can postpone?\"\\n\\n \"Considering the state of our accounts receivable? I\u0027m thinking no. Look, why don\u0027t I take it? Let you rest?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m fine.\" She wasn\u0027t. Didn\u0027t feel fine, and that worried her, but she\u0027d had a crappy night\u0027s sleep. She didn\u0027t have a fever, at least, and that was supposed to be the first sign. \"I don\u0027t want you out of Manny\u0027s place for now. Eidolon - \"\\n\\n \"In case you missed the memo, Eidolon came after you, unless that FedEx was addressed to \u0027Whichever Bimbo Opens It First.\u0027\"\\n\\n \"Who\u0027re you calling a bimbo, chica?\"\\n\\n \"Who\u0027re you calling chica? Ah, hell, get up, would you? Have some coffee. Call me back.\"\\n\\n Click. Jazz and her smooth social skills. Lucia groaned and considered rolling over in the cocoon of pillows, but she knew it wouldn\u0027t do any good.\\n\\n Shower. She needed a hot, cleansing shower.\\n\\n On her third cup of coffee, Lucia called Jazz back and rescheduled the Santos meeting for the client\u0027s offices, on the condition that Jazz stay strictly at home.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re joking,\" Jazz retorted. \"You think I\u0027m letting you roam around by yourself? Somebody tried to poison you. Don\u0027t you get it?\"\\n\\n \"I get it,\" she said, and checked the headlines on the papers that had been left at her door. \"But mail poisoning isn\u0027t exactly the world\u0027s most intimate crime. It\u0027s a leap to go from that to - \"\\n\\n \"Excuse me, but these same people - \"\\n\\n \"How do we know it\u0027s the same people?\"\\n\\n \"These some people put a high-powered-rifle bullet through my office window and nearly killed me! That\u0027s pretty intimate, not to mention direct! Unless you\u0027re wearing Dolce \u0026 Gabbana\u0027s spring bulletproof line - \"\\n\\n \"Oh, Jazz, I\u0027m so proud. A year ago you would have thought Dolce \u0026 Gabbana made chocolate bars.\"\\n\\n \"Would you let me finish?\"\\n\\n \"No. And I\u0027ll tell you why. I\u0027m going to the meeting, and I\u0027m taking Omar with me. You\u0027ve met him. Is he enough of a bodyguard for you?\"\\n\\n Jazz made some halfhearted protests, but it was mainly from being left out, which she hated. But Lucia meant what she said: until Max Simms or the Cross Society sent word that Eidolon\u0027s attention had moved on, and Jazz was no longer a target, Jazz would stay safe in Manny\u0027s home. Bunker. Whatever it was.\\n\\n \"Jazz,\" Lucia said, just when she sensed her partner was about to put down the phone. \"Listen - when Manny gets the results - \"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re the first call,\" Jazz said. \"FBI second. Pansy\u0027s still here, by the way, and feeling fine. You?\"\\n\\n Lucia swallowed another mouthful of coffee and willed the aches in her muscles to go away. \"Fine,\" she said. \"I feel fine.\"\\n\\n Omar showed up downstairs at promptly 9:00 a.m., looking big and mysterious and sexy as hell in his black slacks, black shirt and designer sunglasses, his glossy black hair carelessly curling almost to his shoulders. \"Boss,\" he said in greeting, and uncoiled from his lounging position at the guard station, where he\u0027d been shooting the breeze with Messrs. Tarrant and Valencia, the day shift guards. He slid the glasses up to take a good look at her. \"I leave you alone for a few hours, and you go and get yourself infected.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, Omar, you could have bravely thrown yourself on the FedEx package and prevented all of this.\" She moved past him to the parking garage elevators. \"Cheer up. Maybe you can take a bullet for me today instead.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t get my hopes up,\" he said.\\n\\n Downstairs, his gleaming black SUV was parked next to her Lexus. Illegally. \"I suppose we\u0027re taking your car,\" she said.\\n\\n \"You hired me for my vast array of skills,\" Omar said. \"Of which guarding parking garages is only one.\"\\n\\n \"Shut up and get me there.\"\\n\\n \"Testy! Not enough coffee?\"\\n\\n There wasn\u0027t enough coffee in the world right now to banish the headache that was pounding in her temples. She dug two aspirins out of her purse and swallowed them with a mouthful of bottled water, taken from the built-in cooler between the seats. Omar\u0027s SUV had all the comforts of first class. She was reasonably sure that should she ask for a hot meal, he\u0027d be able to provide it out of the contents of the secret compartments.\\n\\n \"Headache?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"Not enough sleep. And yes, I have antibiotics, and they don\u0027t even know what it was in the envelope yet. I\u0027m fine.\" Speaking of that, she dug the antibiotics out and swallowed the next dose. It tasted bitter. She followed it with plenty of water.\\n\\n He kept silent, wisely. She closed her eyes as the truck weaved through morning traffic to Overland Park. The sun seemed too bright. She checked the air vents and turned the air conditioning up.\\n\\n Omar refrained from comment.\\n\\n The meeting was so dull and ordinary that she coasted through it on autopilot. She smiled at appropriate places and delivered the appropriate endorsements of the ability of the private investigative firm of Callender \u0026 Garza to find their security leak. Santos was a small company. The leak wouldn\u0027t turn out to be some hard-ass spy; more likely, he or she would be a disgruntled midlevel employee, dissatisfied with his or her prospects and pay.\\n\\n \"The truth is,\" she told Erin Santos, the firm\u0027s chief operating officer, \"the target is probably so scared of being caught that he or she will confess immediately, if confronted. I\u0027d suggest some blind interviews this week. Half an hour for each of your employees over the course of two or three days. We\u0027ll find your mole.\" An easy five thousand. Jazz would be pleased.\\n\\n \"Well...\" The Santos team exchanged barely concealed eager looks. \"Can you do it now? Get started, anyway?\"\\n\\n \"Sure,\" she said. It wouldn\u0027t take much. Some guesses, some silence, Omar lounging purposefully in the corner. \"Give me the most likely suspects first. We might as well work it as a triage.\"\\n\\n In fact, it was faster than even Lucia had anticipated. She didn\u0027t get any signs on the first two, but the third person in the door had the body language of someone walking to the electric chair. She had a confession within minutes, and was soon giving her report and leaving the board to handle the guilty employee.\\n\\n Erin Santos was true to her word, and there was indeed a check cut immediately. Lucia accepted it with grave courtesy and just the right touch of distaste. Money changing hands was never to be savored in public, with a client. No matter how happy one might be later at the bank.\\n\\n In the SUV again, she called Jazz and gave her the report as Omar deposited the check at a drive-in teller.\\n\\n Jazz was pleased. \"What\u0027re you doing now?\"\\n\\n \"Now,\" she replied, slipping on her sunglasses against the relentless morning glare, \"I think I will go home and get some more sleep.\"\\n\\n \"Afraid not,\" Jazz said. Her tone was gruesomely cheerful. \"How close are you to the office?\"\\n\\n \u0027Twenty minutes.\"\\n\\n \"Then swing by, would you? Security has someone there who tried to get in to see us. He seems pretty upset at finding the office shut down. Name\u0027s Leonard Davis... Hey, is Ben with you?\"\\n\\n \"With me? Why would he be with me?\"\\n\\n Jazz\u0027s tone turned opaque. \"Just asking. I haven\u0027t heard from him yet.\"\\n\\n \"No idea,\" Lucia said.\\n\\n Omar was already heading in that direction when she hung up the phone.\\n\\n She put her head back against the cushions and tried to nap.\\n\\n There was a gangly young man seated in the lobby of the office building. He was bundled in a big gray sweatshirt and blue jeans, with a baseball cap pulled low. Lucia nodded at the two guards, who were looking tense and unhappy. One of them came to meet her.\\n\\n \"This Leonard Davis guy showed up about thirty minutes ago,\" he said. \"Wanted to see somebody from your firm. I told him the company was shut down for renovations, but he didn\u0027t want to leave. Acting weird, I gotta tell you. You want I should call the cops?\"\\n\\n \"No, let me talk to him first,\" Lucia said, and exchanged a glance with Omar. He moved off to the side, apparently lounging, but he had a clear line of fire if necessary. Lucia walked toward the man.\\n\\n He didn\u0027t budge. Didn\u0027t even look up until the last moment of her approach. He had a regular face, squarely middle of the dial between handsome and homely. Medium brown hair. Dark eyes, narrow, with no particular impact to them.\\n\\n \"Mr. Davis,\" she said, and sank down into one of the leather guest chairs on the opposite side of the glass table. \"You wanted to see someone from Callender \u0026 Garza?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, I did. I didn\u0027t think you guys were here - \"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re temporarily officing elsewhere. What\u0027s so urgent?\"\\n\\n He took off the ball cap in an awkward gesture of gentility, and offered his hand. She shook it. \"I\u0027m real sorry to be trouble, but I really needed - look, it\u0027s my wife. I need to find her, and I was told you might be able to help me.\"\\n\\n \"Do you mind if I ask who sent you?\"\\n\\n \"A Detective, ah, Brown? I have his card somewhere...\" He patted his pockets and came up with a KCPD business card. Welton Brown. Lucia recognized the name - one of Jazz\u0027s contacts in the department. A detective with a solid reputation. \"Anyway, I don\u0027t know where else to go. I mean, I\u0027ve been looking, but nobody seems to have seen her.\"\\n\\n \"Slow down,\" Lucia said, and kept her body language friendly and open. \"Tell me what happened, from the beginning.\"\\n\\n He took a deep breath and put his baseball hat back on. His sweatshirt proclaimed him a fan of the Kansas City Chiefs. Nike cross-trainers on his feet. He looked athletic, and the watch on his wrist was a sturdy, waterproof sports model. No reason at all for her alarm bells to be clanging. He was nothing but vanilla, through and through.\\n\\n He said, \"It\u0027s my wife, Susannah. She, ah, she\u0027s missing. I mean, she didn\u0027t come home from work on Thursday. I went crazy looking for her.\"\\n\\n \"And you went to the police.\" Lucia held up Welton Brown\u0027s card.\\n\\n Leonard Davis nodded. \"Sure. The next morning, when I couldn\u0027t find her at any of the usual spots.\"\\n\\n \"And Detective Brown recommended you come to us?\"\\n\\n He didn\u0027t answer.\\n\\n \"Leonard,\" she said, and drew his eyes. \"Tell me exactly why the police don\u0027t think she was abducted. You know I can find out with one phone call if I have to.\"\\n\\n He looked down at his cross-trainers. \"She might have taken some clothes.\"\\n\\n \"Money? Did she take cash?\"\\n\\n His hands washed each other, slowly. \"She used her ATM card twice that night. But these carjacking guys, they do that, right? They make you get money out of the ATM. That\u0027s what happened. They made her do it.\"\\n\\n \"Does she have a cell phone?\"\\n\\n \"Yes. It\u0027s off.\"\\n\\n \"And her car? Has it been spotted at all?\"\\n\\n \"No. What about a chop shop? Maybe they cut it up for parts.\" Lucia wondered if he was thinking about the same thing happening to his missing wife.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s possible,\" she said. \"The police have this information on file, if you gave it to them. They\u0027ll keep it in the database, and if anything turns up, they\u0027ll reactivate the case. It isn\u0027t that they don\u0027t necessarily believe you, Mr. Davis, it\u0027s that there isn\u0027t much to go on in this particular instance. You understand, don\u0027t you? The police have to focus on crimes that have definitely occurred, not ones that might have happened. The facts you\u0027ve laid out for me could involve a woman who\u0027s gone missing, or a woman who doesn\u0027t want to be found.\"\\n\\n Davis fidgeted, fingers pulling at the seams of his blue jeans. There were fading bruises on his knuckles, and she focused on them for a second before flicking her attention back to his shadowed face.\\n\\n \"I believe she\u0027s missing,\" he said. \"I believe somebody took her and made her get that money. I want you to help me find her.\"\\n\\n She sat back, considering him, Welton Brown\u0027s card cool between her fingers. Omar was still lounging in the corner, looking as if he was paying no attention, but intent on every movement.\\n\\n Something was bothering her, but she couldn\u0027t put her finger on it. As she thought it over, trying to run it down, her cell phone rang.\\n\\n \"Excuse me,\" she said, and stood up to walk to a far corner, her back to Davis. Omar would be watching. Not much risk involved.\\n\\n \"Yo.\" Jazz. \"Leonard Davis has two complaints against him for spousal abuse. KCPD has been to his house plenty of times. Sounds like a lively place.\"\\n\\n \"Have you talked to your friend Detective Brown recently?\"\\n\\n \"Welton? No. Why?\"\\n\\n \"This guy\u0027s carrying his card.\"\\n\\n \"Probably filed a missing persons on his wife. Ten to one, he\u0027s buried her in the backyard. Thinks he\u0027s clever. Brown may be using us to keep him busy while he does a murder investigation. That would be his style.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t appreciate having my time wasted.\"\\n\\n \"Think of it as becoming a cog in the great wheel of justice.\"\\n\\n Lucia said something pithy in Spanish, which was a waste, since Jazz hardly spoke a word. \"So why would this guy engage with us, especially for money?\"\\n\\n \"Makes him look honest when they dig his wife up from the melon patch.\"\\n\\n Lucia turned slightly and glanced over her shoulder. Davis was leaning back now, straightening his baseball cap with his right hand.\\n\\n And something clicked. Something she was sure Welton Brown must have noticed, as well.\\n\\n \"Keep digging,\" she told Jazz. \"I don\u0027t mean in the melon patch.\"\\n\\n \"Funny.\"\\n\\n She ended the call and walked back, slid into the seat and gave him a cool, professional smile.\\n\\n \"How\u0027d you get the bruise on your hand, Mr. Davis?\" she asked. He looked down and instinctively turned it palm upward, hiding the damage. \"It looks like you got it about the time your wife dropped out of sight.\"\\n\\n He didn\u0027t glance up at her. She saw the tension in him and felt a sudden shift in the room, as if gravity had subtly altered.\\n\\n \"I got into a fight,\" he answered.\\n\\n \"Let me put this to you as strongly as I can, Mr. Davis,\" Lucia said. She deliberately dropped her voice, slowed it, held his eyes with her own. \"If you hurt your wife and she is in hiding, I will not track her down for you. Do you understand me?\"\\n\\n \"I got into a fight at work. Look, it didn\u0027t have anything to do with Susannah, I\u0027d never do anything to hurt her.\"\\n\\n She could feel something weighing her down now, a conviction that was drawn from a thousand hints. The way his eyes cut away at the last second. The bruises. The too-direct stare during a denial. Tiny facial tics as he tried to fake sincerity.\\n\\n She cut him off. \"Our rates are a thousand dollars a day.\"\\n\\n Davis sat back, mouth open, and then did that lightning-quick shift of his eyes again. \"I see. So it\u0027s all about the money, right?\"\\n\\n \"We work for a living, yes.\"\\n\\n \"If I give you the money, you\u0027ll find Susannah?\"\\n\\n Not, she noticed, save her. Not find out what happened to her. Just, simply, find.\\n\\n She smiled thinly and stood up, settling her purse over her shoulder. \"Not for any amount, Mr. Davis,\" she said. \"Because I don\u0027t believe you. Either you\u0027ve killed your wife or you\u0027d badly like to finish what you started. Either way, we\u0027re not interested in helping you.\"\\n\\n She expected him to grab, because - if she was right - that would be his automatic response. And he did. His hand shot out and closed on her arm. Squeezed - not with crushing force, because he was aware of Omar, who was straightening up behind her, and the security guards behind the desk. But with enough strength to send a hot jolt of agony up through her shoulder.\\n\\n She didn\u0027t let it affect her cool, professional mask. \"You\u0027ll want to take your hand off of me now, Mr. Davis,\" she said. \"Before something unfortunate happens.\"\\n\\n \"I said I need your help!\" He didn\u0027t sound helpless; he sounded angry. She understood that anger could be a correct response, especially when a loved one was missing. But his anger was off-key. Narcissistic.\\n\\n \"Yes,\" she agreed, and pulled her arm free. \"You did. Now I\u0027d advise you to go look for an attorney.\"\\n\\n Seen up close, those eyes were probably his greatest asset. The kind of little-boy eyes that lulled women into trusting, into believing his apologies, into letting down their guard.\\n\\n His eyes lied better than the rest of him.\\n\\n He stepped back. \"You\u0027ve got the wrong idea about me.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe so. And if that\u0027s the case, then I will be sincerely sorry. But I can\u0027t take the chance.\"\\n\\n She nodded to Omar, and walked away to the security desk. The two guards looked attentive.\\n\\n \"Escort him out,\" she said. \"He doesn\u0027t come back inside.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, ma\u0027am.\"\\n\\n In the elevator, Omar didn\u0027t say a word, but he was watching her with interest. She felt tired. Achy. Wanted to collapse back into her warm, soft bed and sleep for days.\\n\\n \"What?\" she asked.\\n\\n He shrugged as he pushed the button for the parking garage. \"Kinda hard on the guy.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s had numerous abuse complaints.\"\\n\\n \"Doesn\u0027t mean she\u0027s not missing.\"\\n\\n \"It might mean that she\u0027s missing on purpose, and the last thing she needs is us bringing this guy to her doorstep.\"\\n\\n \"Sometimes I think you don\u0027t like people very much,\" he said.\\n\\n \"People, meaning men?\"\\n\\n Another shrug.\\n\\n \"I like men just fine,\" she said. \"I just like them better when they\u0027re not lying their asses off to me.\"\\n\\n Omar\u0027s dimples flashed as he smiled. \"You don\u0027t get a lot of dates, huh?\"\\n\\n \"Not second ones.\"\\n\\n The door creaked open at the well-lit parking level, and Omar went out first, presenting an unmissable target should anyone be taking aim. He didn\u0027t even think about doing it. It was his job. She admired that, even while she couldn\u0027t quite understand the mentality behind it.\\n\\n \"Clear,\" he said, after scanning the area. She stepped out from behind him, and they walked quickly toward the SUV.\\n\\n She had no warning, but suddenly she felt a powerful shove to the left, felt the world tilt, and landed hard on her side. She rolled instinctively, holding her head up to keep from hitting the concrete floor, and landed next to a fat gray pillar. She hadn\u0027t thought about drawing her gun, but it was out, both hands bracing it in textbook firing position.\\n\\n \"Easy,\" Omar was saying. He was still standing out in the open, having executed his first priority - moving her out of the line of fire. He was holding up both empty hands and trying to look as inoffensive as possible, which was odd behavior for any bodyguard, but Omar in particular. Lucia edged forward and peered around the barrier, hunting a target.\\n\\n A woman was standing in front of him. Thin, fragile, with short dark hair and ivory-pale skin that showed off a lurid array of bruises. Half her face was swollen almost beyond recognition.\\n\\n She had a gun trained on Omar.\\n\\n \"Easy,\" he said again, and held his hands higher when she flinched. \"Nobody\u0027s here to hurt you.\"\\n\\n \"I need your help,\" she blurted. There were tears running from her eyes, streaking silver down her face. She slurred her words, thanks to a badly swollen lip. \"Please.\"\\n\\n It came to Lucia in a lightning flash of comprehension, and she slowly stood up, holstered her gun and stepped out from behind the pillar, hands raised.\\n\\n \"Susannah?\" she asked. \"Susannah Davis? You don\u0027t have to be afraid now. You\u0027re safe. We\u0027re not working for your husband. My name is Lucia Garza.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/devil-s-due-red-letter-days-2/page-8.html","bookId":2311,"book":{"id":2311,"title":"Devil\u0027s Due (Red Letter Days #2)","description":"Storyline: Devil\u0027s Due (Red Letter Days #2) \\n The money Lucia and her new partner received to open their detective agency had come with strings: any assignment delivered via red envelope had to be top priority.
