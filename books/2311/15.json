{"id":95661,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"There was a big black limousine in the parking lot across the street and it held all of them comfortably. Or uncomfortably, thanks to the tension in the passenger compartment. It was a long, silent ride, but the landmarks were familiar. Lucia exchanged a quick look with Jazz, who raised her eyebrows and widened her eyes. Lucia shrugged.\n The limousine turned down the slope of a parking garage, and parked on the top level, next to the elevators of...their own office building.\n \"You\u0027re kidding,\" Jazz said flatly.\n \"You may be assured, Ms. Callender, that I\u0027m deadly serious today,\" Laskins said. \"There\u0027s nothing I\u0027m finding remotely amusing.\"\n Gregory Ivanovich hustled them into the elevators and upstairs. The doors had been opened wide into their office suite, and all the lights were on. No one there. At least, Lucia thought, Pansy hadn\u0027t been caught up in this mess. That was some comfort.\n Laskins opened the doors to the big conference room, with its long, gleaming table and recessed lighting.\n It was full of people, who were chatting among themselves in a pleasant buzz of sound. Twelve - no, fourteen of them. Sixteen, counting Laskins, who took a chair at the table, and Gregory, who leaned against a wall, seeming entirely at home. Lucia scanned the other faces quickly. Laskins was the very image of a successful lawyer, but there was a tired, unkempt-looking woman who might have come straight from tending her kids. A tall, thin black man who wore glasses and looked like a professor. A slender, well-dressed young woman with understated jewelry and the unmistakable aura of wealth.\n The buzz died down as everyone\u0027s attention focused on the newcomers.\n \"Let me guess. The Cross Society,\" Jazz said, just as Lucia was about to. \"Wow. Imagine how impressed I am. No, go on. Just imagine.\"\n The stay-at-home mom smiled. She was the only one who did.\n \"Not the entire society, obviously, merely a few key players,\" Laskins said, and shut the doors. \"Be seated, the three of you.\"\n \"Where\u0027s James?\" Jazz asked.\n \"James?\" Laskins echoed, as if he\u0027d never heard the name before. Lucia felt a twinge of anxiety, and saw it in Jazz, as well.\n \"James Borden, you asshole. Where is he?\" When Jazz got scared, she got belligerent.\n \"Mr. Borden is on an errand. It\u0027s quite an important one, actually. Be seated, Ms. Callender. We don\u0027t have a lot of time.\"\n Gregory stepped forward and pulled out a chair. He performed an extravagant comic-opera bow. Lucia tried to send Jazz a message in a last, quick glance, and slid into an empty chair on the other side of the table. McCarthy took the one next to her.\n Gregory bowed again, even more comically.\n Jazz gritted her teeth and sat.\n \"What in the hell is this, Laskins?\" Lucia asked. For answer, he held up his hand. Gregory stepped forward and put something into it.\n A red envelope.\n \"This,\" he said, \"is a duplicate of what went to Ms. Callender earlier in the day,\" he said. \"It was waiting for her when she arrived back at her temporary home in Manny Glickman\u0027s warehouse. Go ahead. Open it, Ms. Callender.\"\n Jazz just stared at him. Didn\u0027t reach for it. After a long enough pause that it became clear she wasn\u0027t about to comply, Lucia reached over and took it. She opened it and took out a single white sheet of folded paper.\n On it was written, DO NOT ALLOW LUCIA GARZA TO CARRY THROUGH WITH THE INVESTIGATION, OF J\u0026J ELECTROPLATING.\n No letterhead, no signature. Lucia looked up at Jazz, who returned her stare without flinching. There was something fierce in her eyes.\n \"Did you get it, Ms. Callender?\" Laskins asked.\n \"Yes,\" Jazz said. \"I got it.\"\n \"Then why did you fail to follow instructions? Do you not yet understand the seriousness of the situation? When you fail to follow our instructions, people die.\"\n \"Yeah, and guess what? When we do follow your instructions, people die,\" Jazz said. \"I\u0027m sick of operating in the dark. No more of these mysterious bullshit messages from nowhere. You want to enlist us in your army of do-gooders, you\u0027d better damn well convince me how holding off on busting a bunch of terrorists is doing good!\"\n \"It\u0027s not your job to question how or why we give these instructions!\" Laskins bellowed. His face had gone entirely red, so mottled Lucia was afraid he was going to clutch his chest and hit the floor.\n \"Bite me!\" Jazz screamed. \"You guys treat us like trained monkeys, and you know what? We can make our own decisions. Isn\u0027t that why we\u0027re so damn valuable to you? Because what we do matters?\"\n \"Yes,\" said the thin black man, farther down the table. He\u0027d helped himself to a cup of tea, Lucia saw. By the looks of other cups around the room, they\u0027d also started the coffeemaker. They\u0027d certainly made themselves thoroughly at home. \"Yes, you do make your own decisions. And you have no idea how much chaos that creates, do you? Presumptions are made about how the time stream will run - they have to be made, or we\u0027d never be able to predict any outcomes at all. You are a fulcrum upon which events turn. And when you don\u0027t do as we\u0027ve asked, you upset everything.\"\n The hausfrau next to him laughed apologetically. \"You\u0027ve lost them, Jeffrey.\" She put a plump, motherly hand over his and gave Lucia a warm smile. \"You have to imagine the scope of what we\u0027re talking about, ladies. It\u0027s not just an either-or proposition. It\u0027s like the biggest pin-ball game you can imagine, with a hundred thousand balls in play, and a million flippers, each of which has a simple decision to make. Do or don\u0027t. You see, it was a simple decision we made on your behalf - don\u0027t move on the terrorist information. In connection with about fifty other simple decisions, it cleared the way for something important to happen. However, now all of that is unclear again, the ball randomly bouncing. We can\u0027t control what we can\u0027t foresee.\"\n Lucia looked around at all of them, all the quiet faces, ranging from scowls to smiles. \"You\u0027re all...psychics? Like Simms?\"\n \"Oh, no.\" The man called Jeffrey sipped his tea and looked put out at the question. \"There are only a handful of genuine psychics in this world, you know. Fifty or so, in any generation - \"\n \"Sixty-two as of last week,\" murmured an old, creaky gentleman two chairs down. He blinked at Lucia benignly from behind thick, magnifying lenses.\n \"Edgar, it doesn\u0027t matter. I wasn\u0027t trying to be precise, I was - \"\n \"Precision is important,\" Edgar said. \"I wouldn\u0027t want our new friends to think we weren\u0027t precise. My, no.\"\n Jeffrey shot him a grim look. \"As I was saying, I could give you the exact mathematical equations about how we derive the existence and location of these people, but I doubt it would mean anything to you. To put it simply, we are a kind of clearinghouse. In addition to Simms, who founded our organization, we maintain facilities in which quite a number of precognitives are housed and cared for. They give us predictions - some, as many as hundreds each day. We feed these into a sophisticated mathematical model, and from that, we see the shape of things to come. Not in detail, you understand. In generalities. The psychics themselves are specific, but in combining their prophecies you lose the - the details. You understand?\"\n Lucia exchanged a fast look with Jazz. Why isn\u0027t Borden here? She couldn\u0027t tell if Jazz was thinking about that; her partner looked closed and coplike, utterly unreadable. Just like McCarthy, next to her. How much of this had he heard before? How much did he believe? Not enough, obviously, if he\u0027d finally broken with the Society and gotten himself tossed in jail for his troubles.\n \"Yes, I understand,\" she said, although she was fairly certain that she didn\u0027t. \"You get hundreds of predictions a day. Somehow you create scenarios out of blending all of them together, to show you the future.\"\n \"No,\" Laskins said. He\u0027d recovered some of his calm. His color was a hot pink instead of deep red, and he\u0027d seated himself again. \"Not the future. A - sketch of the future. A rough outline of it, with some details in place to give it structure and scope.\"\n \"And if you don\u0027t like what you see,\" McCarthy said, \"you just figure out which pinball levers to push until you get what you want.\"\n It was as if they\u0027d forgotten he was there. All eyes turned toward him. If he felt the weight of it, he didn\u0027t let it show; he was reconfiguring a paper clip into steel origami, and he kept right on doing it.\n \"What they\u0027re not telling you,\" McCarthy continued, \"is that they\u0027re all about the greater good. Excuse me, the greater good as they see it. So if a couple hundred people have to die in an upcoming terrorist attack, well, those are acceptable losses if that still takes us down the path they want us to follow.\"\n \"People die,\" said a young woman dressed in ill-fitting blue jeans over a skeletal frame. Her arms were frighteningly thin, as if she\u0027d just come from a prison camp. But since her skin had a tanning-salon glow, Lucia was fairly certain that it was the gauntness of fashion, not famine. \"You can\u0027t make decisions like this based on individuals, it makes everything worthless. You have to take a wider view than that.\"\n \"I\u0027m sure that\u0027s a great comfort to the dead,\" Lucia said. \"That they died for a reason.\"\n \"Everybody dies for a reason,\" Laskins said. \"We just try to make it a better reason than random chance.\"\n \"That apply to all of you, too?\" McCarthy asked. They looked surprised. \"No. Didn\u0027t think so. That\u0027s just for the rank and file, right? The chorus? The spear carriers? The guy on the left, in the back row, whose name we never know? It\u0027s okay if he dies for a reason. Not if your own kid does.\" He got up, staring at them in bitter contempt. \"I told you before, I\u0027m not playing your game.\"\n The gaunt woman smiled cynically. \"So you\u0027ve told us,\" she said. \"Have you informed your friends that we provided the information that got you out of prison? In return for your cooperation?\"\n McCarthy slowly bent over and put his hands flat on the table, staring at her. If looks could kill... Lucia shuddered at what was in his face. She\u0027d thought Gregory had the wolf in him, but this was something else again.\n \"I\u0027m not working for you.\" He said it softly, but it was loaded with meaning. \"You have no idea what it costs me, but I\u0027m not doing it. Do you understand me? You can send me back to prison. You can kill me. You can\u0027t make me do what you want.\"\n \"I think you\u0027ll find,\" she said in an even softer whisper, \"that it no longer matters, Mr. McCarthy. You\u0027ve served your purpose. You\u0027re Chorus. You\u0027re that poor man in the back row whose name we won\u0027t remember when you die.\"\n Silence. Lucia felt her whole body trembling with the tension of it. There was something terrible being said, something awful in Ben\u0027s face.\n \"What did you do?\" he asked, and suddenly all that control was gone, and he was moving, moving fast, screaming. \"What did you do, you bitch? You were just supposed to take care of her, you weren\u0027t supposed to - \"\n He went over the table. The woman stumbled backward, terror written all over her face.\n \"No!\" Laskins yelled, and then it was a melee, and when it was over, McCarthy was on the carpet, facedown, panting, with Gregory\u0027s knee in his back. \"I will not have this, do you understand? This behavior is unacceptable!\"\n \"Unacceptable!\" McCarthy\u0027s voice broke. \"You fucking bastards, you have no idea what you\u0027re doing, do you? Ask Simms. Ask Simms if you don\u0027t believe me.\"\n Silence. The assembled members milled around, and some of them returned to their chairs. Laskins looked around the room, then cleared his throat.\n \"Unfortunately, we can\u0027t do that,\" he said. \"Max Simms broke out of his prison three days ago. We have no idea where he is at this point.\"\n The thank-you messages Jazz and Lucia had gotten had been signed, in invisible ink, by Max Simms. They don\u0027t know that, Lucia thought, and met Jazz\u0027s eyes.\n Jazz smiled slightly. Not a nice expression. She was furious, and she wanted to hit something, anything.\n The fact that she hadn\u0027t, that she\u0027d let McCarthy be taken down without jumping in with both feet, was significant. \"What do you want?\" Lucia asked. \"Why are we here?\" Laskins seemed to forget about McCarthy for a moment to focus back on the two of them.\n \"You\u0027re here for the same reason we all are. Because if you weren\u0027t, you\u0027d be dead,\" he said. \"And really, we can\u0027t have that happen. Not just now. Now if you don\u0027t sit quietly, I\u0027m going to have Mr. Ivanovich handcuff and gag you.\"\n \"What are you waiting for?\" Jazz demanded.\n \"Something terrible.\" It was one of the other Cross Society members, a sad-looking little man in a gray sports coat. He had a ragged fringe of gray hair clinging to the crown of his skull, and big dark eyes behind round glasses. \"Something terrible. I wish we could avoid it, but it\u0027s impossible. Something terrible must happen.\"\n Gregory Ivanovich let McCarthy up off of the floor and tossed a tangle of zip ties onto the conference table, along with three leather ball gags. Tools of his trade. Lucia felt her stomach clench when she saw them.\n \"Sit quietly, or I will do it,\" he said. \"You know it, dorogaya. Tell them.\"\n Lucia leaned forward and put a hand on Jazz\u0027s arm. A light pressure, but Jazz got the message.\n McCarthy rose to his feet, breathing heavily, face still red with fury, but he didn\u0027t say anything either. After a moment, he took the chair next to Jazz and clasped his hands tight on top of the table. His knuckles turned as pale as parchment. Silence.\n \"That\u0027s better,\" Laskins said, and turned to look out the window at the view. \"That\u0027s better. Now, we wait.\"\n Two hours later, with no explanation, one of the Society members\u0027 beeper went off, and some unspoken signal was passed. They all relaxed.\n Somewhere, something terrible had happened.\n \"Take them into the other room,\" Laskins said to Gregory. \"Lock them in. We\u0027ll see to them later.\"\n He nodded and made a gesture to get Lucia, Jazz and McCarthy to their feet. The next room was an empty office, and Gregory showed them in with another of his extravagant gestures. With a gun in his hand, of course. \"No lock on the door,\" Jazz pointed out. For her, it was a pretty mild tone. Gregory\u0027s lips grinned, but the rest of his face stayed entirely still.\n \"Pretty one, I\u0027m the lock,\" he said. \"I\u0027ll be sitting in a chair across from the door. By all means, open it. I\u0027m a very good shot, but I can always use the practice.\" He pulled the door shut.\n \"He\u0027s bluffing,\" Jazz said.\n \"No,\" Lucia sighed. \"He\u0027s not. Ben? You okay?\"\n He hadn\u0027t said a word. He didn\u0027t even look at her. \"I\u0027m fine.\" He didn\u0027t sound fine. He sounded - terrible. \"How long you think they\u0027ll keep us here?\"\n \"Who the hell cares?\" Jazz retorted. She stalked toward him. \"You want to explain now?\"\n His eyes focused on her, then slid away. He walked toward a window, changed course and folded himself into a chair in the corner. Eyes shut.\n \"Oh, no you don\u0027t,\" Jazz said, and followed him. She stood over him, hands balled into fists. \"What they said in there. About the Cross Society getting you out of jail. That was bullshit, right? Right?\"\n He didn\u0027t answer. Lucia felt what was left of the strength of fear bleed away, and her muscles demanded she sit. She leaned, instead, trying to look composed. \"No,\" she said for him. \"It wasn\u0027t. The pictures exonerating you were genuine, but they\u0027d withheld them, hadn\u0027t they? They wanted something from you. And until you agreed, they wouldn\u0027t release the evidence that would get you out of prison.\"\n \"I wasn\u0027t guilty,\" he said. His eyes were still shut.\n \"I know,\" she murmured. \"Not of those murders.\"\n \"Wait a minute. They did release the pictures,\" Jazz said. \"So...you agreed...\"\n McCarthy stayed quiet. Jazz reached down and grabbed the faded shoulders of his open flannel shirt, hauling him to his feet. \"You agreed,\" she repeated, and her voice was deadly quiet. \"To what?\"\n \"It doesn\u0027t concern you.\"\n \"No,\" Lucia said. \"It concerns me. Doesn\u0027t it?\"\n His eyes opened, and even as numbed and tired and betrayed as she was, she flinched from what was in them. Jazz kept asking the question, but Lucia knew full well McCarthy wasn\u0027t going to answer her. She walked to the window and stared out, thought about Laskins treating himself to the same view one wall over.\n She dug her cell phone from her purse and speed-dialed Manny\u0027s number.\n No answer.\n The office door opened, and an older man walked in. He was slender and stooped, with mild blue eyes and thin white hair. Short, maybe five foot five at most.\n He looked sweet and a little lost, and his clothes were too big for him. He smiled at them impartially, closed the door behind him and walked across the room to the bare desk. He sat down in the chair, slid open the bottom drawer and took out a duffel bag. He unzipped it and revealed four military-issue breathing masks.\n \"You\u0027ll need these,\" he said, and held one out. Nobody moved. \"Tick tock, people, tick tock. Let\u0027s move.\"\n \"Who the hell is this?\" Lucia asked in confusion, and she looked at Jazz for information.\n Jazz was staring at the man intently and didn\u0027t answer.\n McCarthy did. He stepped forward, took the gas mask and said, \"Meet Max Simms.\"\n And then he put on the mask.\n Jazz took the second one. Simms favored her with a beatific smile, then turned his attention to Lucia.\n \"Max Simms,\" she repeated. \"You\u0027re kidding.\"\n \"We don\u0027t have time for introductions,\" Simms said, and checked a watch on his left wrist. \"Let\u0027s see, did I adjust it for the time zone? Yes, I think I did. You have approximately ten seconds to make your decision, Lucia. Forgive me if I don\u0027t wait.\"\n Jazz had tugged on her mask. Simms put his on.\n Lucia looked at them all, one after another, and grabbed for the last one.\n She got it in place as Simm\u0027s silent finger count went to three, then to two, then to a single index finger.\n Then to zero.\n Nothing seemed to happen at all. She felt nothing, smelled nothing except the industrial plastic of the mask and her own sweat. Her breath was coming fast, too fast.\n \"What the hell is going on?\" she asked. The plastic muffled and distorted her voice, but she was pretty sure the others could hear her. Jazz lifted her hands and dropped them. McCarthy shook his head.\n Simms said, \"Obviously, somebody\u0027s delivered gas into this building.\"\n \"Lethal?\" Lucia\u0027s mind went to the drums of chemicals back at the warehouse.\n \"No. Wait, please.\"\n If anything had happened in the other rooms, there was no indication at all. No sound. The minutes seemed to drag on, and on, and on. Simms waited, watching the second hand of his watch, and then moved to the door and opened it.\n Gregory Ivanovich was nowhere in sight. A chair sat empty where he\u0027d been. No signs of struggle.\n Simms led them toward the elevators. As they passed the conference room, Lucia slowed and looked in.\n Empty chairs, pushed back unevenly from the table. A handprint on the glass, smudging the sunlight. An overturned cup, with coffee dripping from the edge of the table onto the floor.\n There were drag marks on the carpet.\n She heard the steady chop of a helicopter - no, helicopters. She dashed forward to look out of the window just as three large black aircraft gained the sky and headed for the far horizon.\n Where had they come from?\n \"Eidolon,\" she whispered. Her breath fogged the plastic of the gas mask. \"Son of a bitch. You\u0027re working with them.\"\n Simms took her by the elbow and silently walked her from the conference room out to the lobby. He hit the button for the elevator and stood with his hands behind his back, bouncing on his toes as if he had energy to burn. He hadn\u0027t taken off the mask. Lucia felt sweat trickling down the sides of her face and itched to rip the thing away, but she didn\u0027t dare. What the hell had just happened? How had Eidolon pulled that off? Not without help, that much was sure...\n McCarthy\u0027s hand touched hers and twined around it, holding fast. She looked at him, but he was staring straight ahead, face unreadable under the gas mask. She shook free.\n Once they were in the elevator and the doors had shut, Simms stripped off his gas mask. Jazz was yelling even before hers hit the floor. \"What in the hell was that, you asshole? What the hell is going on?\"\n \"I just saved your lives,\" Simms said. \"Well, Jazz, yours and Ben\u0027s. Lucia\u0027s survival has always been assured.\"\n \"Excuse me?\" Lucia tossed her gas mask in a pile with the others. The elevator continued down to the parking level, dinged and disgorged them into the empty structure. No sign of the limousine that had delivered them. Simms looked momentarily nonplussed, and then smiled as a shadow rumbled at the top of the ramp and started down.\n Manny\u0027s black Hummer, glossy and impenetrable in the light. He was driving.\n James Borden was in the passenger seat. He jumped out as the vehicle squealed to a stop, and threw open all the doors.\n \"In the car,\" Simms said. \"This isn\u0027t safe.\"\n That, Lucia thought, was the understatement of the century.\n \"You\u0027re in on this?\" Jazz asked Manny, when they\u0027d piled into the SUV and pulled out of the parking lot. Simms was in the back, with Borden and McCarthy; Jazz and Lucia were up front. Not that Lucia was happy having Simms at her back, but she wouldn\u0027t be any happier having him next to her.\n Manny shot Jazz a near-panicked look. \"In on what?\"\n \"The Cross Society crap. Whatever crack dream conspiracy this is!\"\n \"What?\"\n Jazz got control of herself, or at least enough to take in a couple of deep breaths. \"Why did you show up?\"\n \"Borden said you needed a ride. Jazz, you know I don\u0027t like strangers in my car. Who is he?\"\n Jazz looked over her shoulder at Borden, then at Simms. She turned around and started to answer, but Borden cut her off. \"We can talk about this at the warehouse.\"\n \"No freakin\u0027 way am I taking a stranger to my house,\" Manny said. He stared at Simms in the rearview mirror. Simms stared back. \"No freakin\u0027 way.\"\n Simms looked away and said, as if he were talking to thin air, \"Ben, how did you locate the unmarked spot where Mr. Glickman had been buried alive?\"\n Manny braked. Cars honked all around them, and he blinked and hit the gas. Going a little too fast, this time.\n \"Answer the question, Ben,\" Simms said gently.\n \"I followed the leads. I worked the case. So did Jazz.\"\n \"Yes, but you had something Jazz didn\u0027t, isn\u0027t that true?\"\n \"Don\u0027t.\"\n \"You had luck.\"\n \"Not everything is your goddamn psychic powers at work, Simms.\"\n \"Not everything,\" Simms agreed. \"And you would have found Manny eventually. But I helped you find him before it was too late. In the nick of time, in fact. Wouldn\u0027t you agree with that?\"\n Silence. McCarthy was staring intently out the window. Manny, on the other hand, was an open book - sweating, shaking, clearly and deeply rattled.\n \"Mr. Glickman, I\u0027m not a stranger to you,\" Simms said. \"I wish I could have helped you before you experienced - what you experienced. It is not a perfect world, and what I do is even more imperfect than that. But I need you now. I need your help. And I\u0027m asking you to give it even though I know that it\u0027s against your nature.\"\n \"Did he - \" Manny\u0027s voice failed, choked off. He slowed and stopped at a light, but Lucia could tell that it was just reflex, not thought. He was driving on autopilot. \"Ben, did this guy tell you where to find me?\"\n McCarthy closed his eyes. \"I knew where to find you. He told me exactly where to dig. Without that - it would have been another hour, probably.\"\n Manny\u0027s eyes filled with tears. Lucia, even though she knew it wasn\u0027t welcome, even though she knew he\u0027d flinch, put her hand on his arm.\n He did flinch. But not as badly as he might have.\n \"You don\u0027t have to do anything you don\u0027t want to, Manny,\" Lucia said. \"Ever. You know that. Neither Jazz nor I would ever ask it of you.\"\n He nodded convulsively, gulped in a breath and hit the gas when the light turned green.\n Simms settled back, content, smiling.\n She hated him, in that bright and completely lucid second.\n \"You know,\" Jazz said, as Manny pushed together two worktables and unfolded camp chairs, \"we ought to just office here. Save ourselves the trouble.\"\n \"You couldn\u0027t afford the rent,\" Manny said. He wasn\u0027t looking at Ben or Simms. Ben, in turn, seemed to be avoiding everyone. The tension was so palpable it was like a vibration under Lucia\u0027s skin.\n \"Kidding.\"\n \"Yeah, well, I\u0027m not in the mood, Jazz.\" Manny walked over to the part of the warehouse that was designated as his lab, opened a drawer, slammed it, opened another.\n He came up with a pistol. A.38, Lucia thought. He pointed it directly at Max Simms, who didn\u0027t - of course - look remotely worried or surprised.\n \"Hey!\" Jazz yelped. \"Manny, what the hell - \"\n \"Speaking of serial killers,\" Manny said quietly. \"You think I don\u0027t know why he went to prison? I know.\" His hand was shaking. \"Give me a good reason why I shouldn\u0027t just kill him now.\"\n \"Prison wouldn\u0027t be kind to you, Manny,\" McCarthy said. He hadn\u0027t moved from where he stood.\n \"That\u0027s it? That\u0027s your reason?\"\n \"The only reason I know. Hey, go ahead. Kill the son of a bitch, as far as I\u0027m concerned. None of this crap matters to me anymore.\"\n \"Well, it matters to me,\" Jazz said. \"Manny, don\u0027t. He can help us.\"\n \"Yeah? Like he helped me?\"\n \"He did help you, Manny.\"\n \"He could have done it earlier! \" Manny yelled, and for a blinding second Lucia thought he\u0027d fire. But then he threw the gun back in the drawer and slammed it and stalked away. \"Fuck. Do what you want. I\u0027ll be in my office.\"\n He went to the far door at the end of the room, punched in numbers and went through. The door - at least three inches of\u0027 solid metal - sealed with a solid thunk behind him, and the lights on the panel turned blood-red.\n \"What happened back there?\" That was Borden, who was looking furious and ruffled and belligerent. His hair was spiked again, not so much from over-application of product but from running his hands through it in distraction. \"Where are they? Laskins and the others?\"\n Simms, for answer, checked his watch. He was still looking down at it when he said quietly, \"By this time? Nearly all of them are dead. The rest are running for their lives. Unfortunate.\"\n Borden\u0027s mouth opened and closed, and he leaned on the makeshift conference table and let his head drop forward. Struggling for control. \"Laskins?\" he asked.\n \"Milo Laskins is alive,\" Simms said. \"I don\u0027t see any possibility that he\u0027ll have to give up his life in the current scenario. However, his days at Gabriel, Pike \u0026 Laskins are numbered, Mr. Borden. Your star is in ascendance. Feel free to be grateful.\"\n Borden\u0027s head snapped up. His face was stark. \"Grateful?\"\n \"You had no real affection for those people, and we both know it. You disagreed with them quite a number of times, most recently just today. Let\u0027s not have any gnashing of teeth.\"\n \"You unbelievable bastard.\"\n \"Take a seat.\"\n \"Not with you. You arranged this - \"\n \"Take a seat, Borden.\" Simms\u0027s voice snapped with command, and for a second there was nothing soft about him, nothing at all. Lucia remembered Jazz\u0027s description of him. Creepy. \"The rest of you. Sit down. I don\u0027t have time for your histrionics.\"\n \"What about mine?\" Ben McCarthy\u0027s voice was soft, and somehow even more intense than Simms\u0027s. Lucia looked over at him, but he was turned away, showing her only a hard profile, an angular shoulder, a fist clenched at his side. \"You got time for mine?\"\n Simms met his eyes. \"I\u0027m sorry. That was not my choice, Ben. That was never my choice.\"\n \"It served your purposes.\"\n \"Yes. It did. It does. It will. What you\u0027re referring to had to happen. How it happened was your doing, by the decisions you made. You knew what the Society wanted from you. You chose to do otherwise.\" Simms studied him for a few seconds in silence. \"How long have you known?\"\n \u0027They told me, earlier today. Indirectly.\" McCarthy\u0027s lips stretched, baring his teeth, but it wasn\u0027t a smile. \"They said I\u0027d served my purpose. And we both know what that purpose was, from the very beginning.\"\n \"All right, I\u0027m calling bullshit,\" Jazz said flatly, and slid into a chair next to McCarthy. She leaned on her elbows, staring at Simms. \"What the hell are you two talking about?\"\n Nobody answered her. Borden pantomimed I have no idea with a helpless lift of his shoulders.\n \"About what happened to me when I was missing,\" Lucia said. \"Am I correct? Gregory Ivanovich was behind that, at least.\"\n \"He did his part.\" Simms\u0027s yellowed teeth flashed in a smile. \"Don\u0027t worry. Mr. Ivanovich left and isn\u0027t looking back.\"\n \"Something happened to me while I was missing.\"\n \"You were treated for your illness.\"\n \"Something else.\"\n Simms, for answer, removed a sealed manila envelope from his jacket pocket, unfolded it and slid it across the table. Not to her. To McCarthy.\n McCarthy didn\u0027t touch it. \"What is it?\"\n \"Proof. I was hoping we might be able to avoid the unpleasantries, but you seem determined.\"\n \"You son of a bitch. You cold-blooded - \"\n \"In private,\" Simms said. \"As you said, it is a personal matter.\"\n McCarthy shoved back from the table and stared down for a few seconds.\n \"I need someplace quiet,\" he said. \"No surveillance. No cameras.\"\n Jazz looked around and said, \"Darkroom. Second door along the wall.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/devil-s-due-red-letter-days-2/page-15.html","bookId":2311,"book":{"id":2311,"title":"Devil\u0027s Due (Red Letter Days #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Devil\u0027s Due (Red Letter Days #2) \n The money Lucia and her new partner received to open their detective agency had come with strings: any assignment delivered via red envelope had to be top priority.
