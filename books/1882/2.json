She shrieked in anger and dismay, raining blows on his shoulders, his chest, his face, and he took them all without being deterred from his task. She heard a rending tear as he ripped her blouse away, tugged at her bra . . . then felt the shock of it to her toes as his warm mouth closed over her nipple.\\n\\n She tried to lunge away from him but he pinned her easily with one hand on her shoulders, while the other tore at her clothes. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" he was groaning against her breast, \"don\u0027t be afraid, I won\u0027t hurt you . . . ah, God, your scent is driving me out of my mind.\" That last ended on a growl, an ominous rumble that filled the dark elevator.\\n\\n She drew in a breath to scream the building down—and sobbed instead. He was too strong for her, she was punching him and clawing him and kicking at him and he was barely noticing. This . . . thing he meant to do, it was really going to happen. To her. Daughter of a cop and a Special Forces veteran, a man and woman generous with their teaching, who never wanted their daughter to be a rape or murder statistic. Jeannie could pick a lock and knock out most men with one punch. But she couldn\u0027t stop this man from taking her by force. Never mind the fact that her mind kept shrieking that this wasn\u0027t happening to her, this was not, was not, was not. It was.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t cry,\" he begged, and she could feel his hands shaking as he gathered her against him. \"We\u0027ll be done soon. It won\u0027t hurt. I\u0027m so sorry to scare you.\"\\n\\n \"Please don\u0027t,\" she whispered, hating the way she sounded—so helpless, so frightened—but unable to do anything about it. \"Please don\u0027t do this.\"\\n\\n He groaned again and squeezed her in a rough hug. \"I have to. I\u0027m not mated, I don\u0027t have any control over this, just like later I won\u0027t have any control over—but you don\u0027t believe me, so we won\u0027t talk about that.\" His voice was still soothing, and now his hands were beneath her, stroking her back, forcing her chest up, and his mouth was buried in her throat, kissing and licking and even—very gently—biting.\\n\\n She could hear his breathing roughen in the dark, heard another rip as her skirt was torn. She remembered herself and struck out at him again, blindly, connecting hard but with no apparent effect. He shredded her linen skirt like it was paper . . . Christ, he was strong! But his hands on her bare flesh were gentle, almost languid. They were everywhere, stroking her skin, sliding across her limbs, and she felt her nipples harden so much it was almost painful. When his lips brushed across one she almost wept with relief, even as she was pushing against his shoulders with all her strength. He rubbed his cheek against that same nipple, his stubble rasping across the sensitive bud, and her fingers curled into fists so she wouldn\u0027t touch him with tenderness. She couldn\u0027t give in to him, no matter how—\\n\\n Stubble?\\n\\n He had been clean shaven two minutes ago.\\n\\n She shoved that thought away, hard. His rough tongue swept across her nipples, a blessed distraction that made her want to scream, made her want him, and she hated wanting him. She tried to remind herself that this man was raping her, but the only thing she could really understand was that he was making her feel as no one had ever made her feel. She was no stranger to sex, but the only man she had ever been intimate with was her college boyfriend, and that was almost three years ago.\\n\\n In the back of her mind, a constant refrain: this isn\u0027t happening. It\u0027s not real. Ten minutes ago I was on my way home; now I\u0027m having sex in the dark with a stranger. Thus, this is a dream. It can\u0027t be happening, ergo it\u0027s not happening. Tempting to believe that voice, to give in to the pleasure he could so skillfully offer her, to . . .\\n\\n She realized she hadn\u0027t hit him in quite a few seconds. That she no longer wanted him to stop. That traitorous thought alone galvanized her into raining more blows on his head, until he caught her wrists and pinned them above her head with one hand.\\n\\n \"Enough,\" he said hoarsely, and she cringed, wondering if he was going to hit her back. \"I don\u0027t blame you one bit, but . . . enough, Jeannie.\"\\n\\n He pinned her knees apart with his own, kept her hands out of his way by keeping them above her head, and bent to kiss her. He jerked back and her teeth snapped together, bare centimeters from his mouth. He could apparently see in the dark like a cat.\\n\\n Or a wolf.\\n\\n She put the ridiculous thought out of her mind as quickly as she could. That way lies madness. That way lies . . .\\n\\n His thumb was stroking the soft cotton of her panties. And moving lower. Her breasts were pressed against his chest, her knees were flat against the carpet, forcing her thighs wide apart, and now his damned fingers were—were—inside her panties. His breathing was so harsh in the dark, almost panting, and she could feel his body thrumming with tension, could hear his teeth grinding together as he fought—what? It was clear he was in the grip of urgent lust, that he wanted to surge inside her and thrust until he could no longer move, but something was holding him back. And now his fingers were delicately brushing the plump lips between her thighs, stroking so sweetly and tenderly . . . and then his thumb slipped between her nether lips while his tongue thrust past her teeth and she nearly shrieked, so intense was her pleasure.\\n\\n He groaned into her mouth and then his fingers were spreading her plump folds apart and his thumb was slipping inside her and his tongue was licking, darting, and she sobbed with frustration and strained against him. His fingers danced across her slick flesh, sweetly stroking, probing, oh so gently rubbing a circle around her throbbing clit, a circle that got smaller and smaller . . . and then his thumb was dipping inside her again while his fingernail flicked past her clitoris, and she shivered so hard she nearly bucked him off.\\n\\n He growled. The sound did not frighten her. It kindled her blood, made her want to growl back, made her want to sink her teeth into his flesh while his flesh sank into her again . . . and again . . . and again . . .\\n\\n She realized dimly that he wasn\u0027t growling, he was saying her name, but his voice was so thick and deep she could hardly understand him. \"Jeannie—let your—hands go?\"\\n\\n \"Yes!\" she screamed, wild to touch him, to feel his flesh against hers, to rip off his clothes as he had ripped hers. He released her wrists and in a flash her arms were around him, pressing him closer, she was tearing at his shirt, frantic to get the damned cloth off him and he was helping her and now her clothes weren\u0027t the only ones in shredded ruin, after all, what was sauce for the goose was sauce for the werewolf, and—\\n\\n His hands were beneath her buttocks, raising her to him, and she could feel that long, hard, hot part of him nudging for entrance. For an instant, reason reclaimed her. Was she really going to do this? This crazy thing? She had no protection and without it, in this day and age, she was taking her life in her hands. And why was she cooperating in her own rape, for the love of God?\\n\\n \"Wait—\" she said in a thin, high voice, but he drove forward, thrust into her with power and searing heat and her good sense left her; she threw back her head and screamed until she thought her throat would burst, screamed at him to never never stop and still he came, that hot hard length parting her, filling her, and it should have hurt, it should have, he was very large and she hadn\u0027t known a lover in years, but her need for him was as great as his for her, and instead of hurting, she needed more.\\n\\n When he was seated completely within her, somehow, somehow, he made himself stop; he gathered her against him and she could hear the furious hammering of his heart. His hands behind her back were hard fists and he was shaking as though he had a fever, and still he stopped. When he forced the words out she could barely understand him.\\n\\n \"—doesn\u0027t—hurt?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" she gasped, wriggling against him, his throbbing cock within her making her frantic. \"No no no please, please you can\u0027t stop now you can\u0027t you can\u0027t you—\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re—very small—sure—doesn\u0027t hurt?\"\\n\\n \"—you can\u0027t you can\u0027t please I please don\u0027t make me—\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t—be afraid—tell truth.\" He took a deep, shuddering breath; his fists were still clenching beneath her and, very distantly, she heard carpet tearing. \"Can try—wait—if you—\"\\n\\n \"—beg, don\u0027t make me beg, please please please PLEASE!\"\\n\\n He pulled away but before she had time to groan her disappointment he slammed forward. His mouth covered hers, his tongue mating with hers as he took her again and again, as they made love so fiercely the elevator shook. And above it all, beyond it all, she could hear someone screaming with hoarse joy and dimly realized it was she making the noise.\\n\\n Her orgasm slammed into her as he was, spasms so fierce she could actually feel her uterus contracting. He stiffened at the height of her climax, threw his head back, and roared at the ceiling in pure animal triumph.\\n\\n For long moments, she didn\u0027t think she would ever be able to move. She could smell the scent of their lovemaking, could hear his heavy breathing, hear her own. Her pulse thudded in her ears and she was damp with sweat and . . . other things.\\n\\n He pulled back and out, his hands frantically feeling her limbs, her neck. \"Are you hurt?\" he asked hoarsely. \"Did I hurt you?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" she said tiredly, ready to sleep for a week. A year. \"No, it was a surprisingly painless rape.\"\\n\\n She felt him flinch, and wondered who she thought she was fooling. It might have been rape for the first minute, but after that she had been an eager participant. Shame made her flush.\\n\\n \"Jeannie—I\u0027m so very sorry. I don\u0027t expect you to understand.\" She felt his hand on her arm and cringed back, hating herself, hating him, and most of all, hating the fact that she wanted to do it all over again, right now. Right here. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" he said again, quietly. \"My poor Jeannie. You were so brave.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t call me that,\" she snapped. She tried to pull her shredded blouse together, but might as well have tried dressing with confetti. \"Don\u0027t call me anything. Don\u0027t talk to me at all.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/love-s-prisoner-wyndham-werewolf-1/page-2.html","bookId":1882,"book":{"id":1882,"title":"Love\u0027s Prisoner (Wyndham Werewolf #1)","description":"Storyline: Love\u0027s Prisoner (Wyndham Werewolf #1) \\n Trapped in an elevator, Jeannie Lawrence experienced unwilling rapture at Michael Windham\u0027s hands.
