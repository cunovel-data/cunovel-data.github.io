The pillow smacked into the door and fell to the floor with a fat thump.\\n\\n Chapter Six\\n\\n Since Wyndham, the sadistic cretin, was panting at the thought of her escape, and since he\u0027d alerted the household she was an unwilling guest, Jeannie decided to stay put for a while, provided her situation didn\u0027t change (read: Wyndham didn\u0027t decide she was in heat again, or Moira didn\u0027t spike her milk with broken glass).\\n\\n So she took lunch with Wyndham and his staff, who were obviously more friends than employees, in a dining room that had more windows than a solarium. Sunlight splashed across the table and gleamed from the blonde wood floors. She sat in the finest dining room she\u0027d ever seen and commented on how delicious everything tasted. They had all been watching her expectantly, and seemed disappointed when she didn\u0027t throw things or leap across the table through the French doors that led to the beach.\\n\\n \"How long have you known you were expecting our leader\u0027s child?\" Derik asked, sliding the bread basket toward her.\\n\\n She helped herself to another piece of the sun-dried tomato and basil loaf and looked at her watch. \"About six hours and fourteen minutes.\"\\n\\n Wyndham looked up from his soup. \"You did one of those home tests? You haven\u0027t seen a doctor?\"\\n\\n \"I had an appointment for this afternoon. Which I missed. Guess why, King Psycho.\"\\n\\n He remained unruffled, though she saw a few of the staff hiding smiles. \"Well, then, you need a doctor. Moira, see to it.\" He glanced at Jeannie with a frown, then added, \"A female physician, if you please.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, sir.\"\\n\\n \"Like there are so many werewolf doctors to choose from?\" Jeannie interrupted sarcastically. \"What, is there a directory or something?\" As the others laughed, she had a sudden thought. \"Oh, will we have to go to town for that?\"\\n\\n Derik, seated at Wyndham\u0027s left (she was at his right), snickered. \"Nice try. The doctor will come here.\"\\n\\n \"Well, goody for him.\"\\n\\n \"Her,\" Michael corrected sharply.\\n\\n Jeannie raised her eyebrows, said nothing, and ate her chicken. Wyndham was jealous? Of a male doctor? Ridiculous. Still, that might be a handy button to push. She filed the thought away.\\n\\n \"Are you mad because you think we\u0027re all crazy, or because you\u0027re here against your will?\" Jon asked curiously.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think that\u0027s a fair question,\" Michael said reproachfully.\\n\\n \"Yeah, I mean, there\u0027s so many reasons for me to be furious at all of you, how can I pick just one?\"\\n\\n \"I meant,\" Jon said, flushing a little, \"the full moon is in three days. And you could watch some of us change, or even one of us change, and then you wouldn\u0027t think we were crazy anymore, so it might be easier to accept—um—are you okay?\"\\n\\n She could actually feel the color draining from her face, could feel the trembling in her hands. She dropped her spoon in her soup and fled the table, running, running, for her rooms.\\n\\n Michael caught up with her on the stairs. She wrenched away from him and kept going. Never one to take a hint, he followed her into her bedroom.\\n\\n \"The full moon?\" she asked, hating the shrill, panicky note in her voice. He shut the door to assure some privacy; she barely noticed. \"The full moon again? I can\u0027t go through that again! I can\u0027t go through that craziness with you again! Don\u0027t you touch me!\"\\n\\n He had been reaching for her, ignored her shriek and pulled her, struggling, into a firm embrace. \"It\u0027s all right,\" he said into her hair. \"I had planned to leave the grounds when my change came. I wouldn\u0027t have forced you again. I promised you I wouldn\u0027t force you, except as punishment.\"\\n\\n \"What good is a promise from you?\" she choked, resting her forehead against his shoulder. He smelled so good. It was as comforting as it was irritating.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve done many things to you, Jeannie, but when have I broken a promise?\"\\n\\n She shrugged sullenly. Then stiffened, remembering. She leaned back to look at him. \"But what about the others? They all think they\u0027re werewolves, too, they all—\"\\n\\n \"You have nothing to fear from the females, because as my mate, you\u0027re alpha female. No, listen, Jeannie—if it\u0027s a delusion, at least we all have to follow the same rules, right? And the males won\u0027t—can\u0027t—touch you without my permission.\" His voice hardened. \"And I won\u0027t give it. Ever. So you have nothing to fear.\"\\n\\n She choked on a laugh.\\n\\n \"You really don\u0027t,\" he said, pressing a warm kiss to her brow. \"Now come back and finish your lunch. You don\u0027t want the baby to starve, do you?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" she sighed. She glanced at him again; he had put an arm around her shoulder and was steering her out the door, back to the dining room. A thought struck her—late, but her thought process was continually being thwarted by shock upon shock. \"What do you think? About my being pregnant, I mean? I never got a chance to ask you. Not that I care either way,\" she added hastily.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m thrilled,\" he said simply, giving her a warm smile. He leaned close and she had the sense he wanted very much to kiss her. Something—belated concern for her feelings?—held him back. \"I love children. The pack needs the continuity of succession. And I get to keep you now, don\u0027t I?\"\\n\\n His voice ended on a teasing note, but she wasn\u0027t amused. \"For a minute there, I was almost liking you,\" she said evenly, pushing his arm away. \"Thanks for turning back into a creep.\"\\n\\n At the dining table, the other werewolves—people—were still glaring at Jon, who was miserably embarrassed. \"I\u0027m really sorry,\" he said at once upon seeing Jeannie. \"I shouldn\u0027t have reminded you about the full moon. I forgot that—\" He paused, glanced at Michael, blushed harder. \"I have no excuse. I\u0027m so sorr—\"\\n\\n \"Please stop,\" she said, rolling her eyes and sitting back down. \"I\u0027m the one who should apologize. I can assure you it\u0027s not my usual M.O. to drop cutlery and flee for the bedroom when the word \u0027moon\u0027 is introduced into the conversation.\"\\n\\n The others laughed, Michael harder than anyone. Jon smiled at her with pure gratitude. And Derik forked another chicken breast onto her plate.\\n\\n \"How about a tour, Moira?\" she asked briskly, after the lunch dishes had been cleared away. \"Might as well check out my new home.\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027ll try to escape,\" Derik warned, finishing the last of his peach sorbet.\\n\\n \"I know,\" Moira said defensively. \"You don\u0027t have to tell me everything, Mr. Right Hand Man.\"\\n\\n \"Bring her to me once you\u0027ve found her again,\" Michael said casually, but his eyes were gleaming in a way Jeannie didn\u0027t much care for.\\n\\n \"Hello!\" she shouted. \"Prisoner still in the room, here! Can you have this conversation where I can\u0027t hear you?\"\\n\\n Moira giggled, and extended a hand. Surprised, Jeannie took it. \"Come on,\" she said. \"We\u0027ll start with the gardens. If you cosh me over the head to escape, try not to muss my hair.\"\\n\\n \"For God\u0027s sake,\" she muttered, but obediently followed Moira out the door.\\n\\n She had, in fact, decided to escape in the next day or so—well before the full moon. Michael\u0027s assurances aside, she had no intention of sharing a home, however sprawlingly luxurious, with twenty people all sharing the same delusion. And she didn\u0027t plan to be in the same state with Wyndham when he went through that again. She wasn\u0027t afraid of being forced, so much as being forced to pleasure. Her cheeks burned with humiliation every time she remembered how he had made her scream in ecstasy. In a flash she was back in the warm, dark elevator, Michael\u0027s cock surging between her thighs, her fingers digging into his skin, wordlessly urging more, more . . .\\n\\n She shook herself, and concentrated on the tour. Now was no time for daydreaming. Now was the time to plot and plan and eventually escape these crazies.\\n\\n In the rose garden, Moira said in a low voice, \"We don\u0027t blame you. For being upset, I mean. It must have been . . .\" She trailed off, then asked timidly, \"Was it very awful?\"\\n\\n \"Huh? You mean being stuck in the elevator with your boss? Well, the lights went out, so we couldn\u0027t read my Glamour . . .\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s kind of you to joke, but . . . I can\u0027t imagine how it must have been for you—a pure human, and an unbeliever, besides. Tearing clothes and scratches and bites, and being forced on your knees and taken without so much as a \u0027please\u0027 . . . I suppose you had to see a doctor.\" She looked as though she was going to burst into tears. \"I suppose you—you tore and . . . and—no wonder you hate him. Us.\"\\n\\n \"Uh . . . yeah. Yeah, it was an unending torment. What\u0027s that building over there?\"\\n\\n As Moira obediently showed her the gardener\u0027s shed, Jeannie\u0027s mind whirled. What Moira imagined hadn\u0027t been at all what happened. Michael had gone out of his way to soothe her, to bring her pleasure, to make sure she was ready for him. He\u0027d had that much control, at least. What would sympathetic Moira think if she told her it had been the most exciting, pleasurable sexual experience of her life? What did that mean, that he\u0027d been nearly out of control, but cared for her enough to do his best not to hurt her, even to bring her pleasure?\\n\\n In a flash, she was back in the warm, dark elevator—\\n\\n Jeannie pushed the thought away with a firmness she didn\u0027t feel.\\n\\n \"You can\u0027t leave the grounds,\" Moira was saying casually, \"until we kill Gerald. But after that, it should be all right.\"\\n\\n \"What?\" She nearly fell into a rose bush. \"Now you\u0027re talking about killing someone so I can leave?\"\\n\\n \"Didn\u0027t our leader explain about Gerald?\"\\n\\n \"Frankly, I tend to tune him out when he\u0027s babbling about all the reasons it\u0027s okay for him to break the law where I\u0027m concerned.\"\\n\\n \"Your law,\" Moira pointed out calmly, \"not ours.\"\\n\\n Jeannie bent to sniff a rose so gray it was almost silver. \"Okay, I\u0027ll bite. What is your law?\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/love-s-prisoner-wyndham-werewolf-1/page-7.html","bookId":1882,"book":{"id":1882,"title":"Love\u0027s Prisoner (Wyndham Werewolf #1)","description":"Storyline: Love\u0027s Prisoner (Wyndham Werewolf #1) \\n Trapped in an elevator, Jeannie Lawrence experienced unwilling rapture at Michael Windham\u0027s hands.
