He’d hidden like a rat from the fury of universal protogenia ever since his power became too great to hide. He’d wracked his brain day in and day out, trying to find a way to protect himself.\\n\\n At last he had found his answer. In joining with Queen and Consort they’d created a realm of their own, and a singular entity to rule over it. He had arisen to the status of a Golden Immortal. [1. Immortals have their own levels, and the golden immortals are among the highest.]\\n\\n To his knowledge there were no other beings like him in all of the universe.\\n\\n So this is what the ancient human immortals felt, he told himself. It was glorious, and one more step toward the ultimate power of Da Luo Golden Immortality.\\n\\n Upon becoming a golden immortal, Monarch enjoyed the protection of the immortal realm. He no longer had to fear retribution from universal protogenia. To be finally unfettered was comforting beyond expression. With the immortal realms protection he could employ his full power without hesitation.\\n\\n After the brief display of his abilities he felt that nothing could stand in his way. These humans – even the Photographer for all her power – were no more than insects before him.\\n\\n It was true that there was a faint sense of danger from the Banishing Blades. However, as the greatest living creature in all of space and time he need not hide any longer. The time for shrinking away had passed, and the danger he perceived only increased his fervor. It was an opportunity to flex his new muscles.\\n\\n Changes had come over the Violet Prince and the three headed abomination as well. It was clear as they rushed forward to deal with the humans. Like Monarch they were protected from universal protogenia by the presence of their immortal realm, and thus were able to use their full strength. The benefits were especially evident for the hydra, whose powers had risen beyond that of the Infinite and approached immortal-level.\\n\\n For the humans, Luo Xianni led the defensive charge. She was joined by the Wine Master, Clockmaker, Driver, Keeper, Bookworm and the Gourmet. There was also the newly arrived Hua Li and Ch Cheng, as well as the Pauper, and the two Gods of Wine. Twelve all together, with the singular aim of protecting Lan Jue and his three companions. \\n\\n Luo Xianni’s face was a somber mask. She knew that the appearance of a golden immortal reduced their chance of success tremendously. She did not understand why Monarch didn’t hurry to destroy the Strategy himself, but she wasn’t going to give up an opportunity to fight back.\\n\\n With this determined passion in her heart she led the way. The pink camera in her hand flashed again and again. She couldn’t stop them, but she could at least slow her enemies down.\\n\\n Without Lan Jue and the other sword bearers, these twelve Paragons were in dire straights. Indeed Luo Xianni was with them, but besides her only the Wine Master and Clockmaker were Reflections of Heaven and Earth. The Driver was next, at the upper borders of the Realm of Protogenia. \\n\\n Against two creatures who no longer had to fear universal protogenia, it seemed like more than they could handle. Battle broke out in dramatic fashion, with the light of their clash blasted through the area as the Paragons fought for their lives.\\n\\n Monarch turned and swung his attention toward the four bastions, which had since regrouped. He held himself with an almost playful air. Tyrannosaurus had been severely damaged but could continue fighting. Of course, at this point all their guns were useless.\\n\\n None of their attacks had any affect against Monarch. On the contrary the energy from them seemed to make him stronger. They were forced to look on, silent and ineffectual.\\n\\n Monarch narrowed his eyes, focusing on the shifting forces within him and the perfection of the immortal realm he’d created. After its creation was complete, his internal environment was ever changing – affected by the presence and power of Europa. This was a special sort of protogenia, one he’d studied for years locked in human genetics.\\n\\n In many ways he’d build this place based on the ancestral memory of the human immortal plane. That mythical land was the foundation he would build upon. His immortal realm would continue to grow just like him, evolving as more immortal creatures took residence within.\\n\\n Monarch had only just stepped through the door. He searched the collected knowledge and experience of the human species, gathered through their DNA, looking for a way to quickly improve their strength.\\n\\n The answer came to him quickly. The quickest route was the power of faith.\\n\\n In the days of the immortal they continued to grow and expand their immortal realm through the faith of the common man. The stronger these past immortals became the more they lent to the realm itself, which in turn protected them more effectively.\\n\\n That was then.\\n\\n Monarch became to outline the makings of a plan. Suddenly it seemed destroying the human race was not the most effective use of his powers. Devouring them would help him minimally, if at all, even for someone like Luo Xianni. Consuming another’s life force would only help him if he were feeding on other immortals.\\n\\n In addition, his immortal realm required more denizens, not less. Killing those with the most potential was counter intuitive. It was better to subjugate these humans and become their master. Through their faith he would be made greater.\\n\\n Suddenly he was less willing to turn his hand against his future subjects. He had enough power now to capture these Paragons. Once they were made more pliable – reeducated, as it were – they could become the first caste of immortals in the world he had built. Monarch was pleased with the idea.\\n\\n Realizing these plans would not be difficult. As for the Banishing Blades, he figured they had to be relics from the human’s ancient gods, passed down through the years. Admittedly part of the reason he did not move to stop them was because he was curious. What were these weapons capable of, these creations of the old pantheon? When they came under his control, how could he use them to his benefit?\\n\\n As an immortal his perception was near omniscient. He saw that the four sword bearers were yet to unleash the true power of these weapons. And so, he chose to watch and commit their process to memory.\\n\\n Indeed Lan Jue and his companions had come upon a problem. The demands of the swords were growing to be more than they could offer.\\n\\n Thanks to Qianlin’s Queen of Heaven powers they were recovering energy quickly, but they were still overwhelmed. What’s more they were not blind to the chaos around them, speed would ensure the greatest effect against their foes. They also feared the backlash if Monarch interrupted their process.\\n\\n The light from the four swords had almost completed arranging itself, but fear still broiled in the hearts of Lan Jue and his friends. Once the arrangement was complete the Banishing Strategy would unleash its true power. Monarch would surely sense the threat to his life and would have to respond with his full might. This was before they considered how much energy the strategy would drain from them in order to complete the ritual.\\n\\n “We have to finish it, even if we must sacrifice ourselves.” Lan Qing shouted.\\n\\n Li Ke had not revealed it to them, but Lan Qing had discovered mysteries of his own while researching the strategy. He discovered a method by which they could complete the ritual even if they didn’t have the needed power. Self-sacrifice. They could offer up their own life force to fuel the Strategy’s completion.\\n\\n Of course this was a tragic prospect, but one they had to consider. There were no other choices, and the cost of failure was too high. Thus the sword bearers joined with the weapons, and in so doing made themselves into fuel for the terrible fires of the Banishing Strategy.\\n\\n The hydra-beast came at the Paragons flailing its six weapons, pushing them back one by one. Were it not for the Driver’s Primordial lightning and the danger it presented, the monster would have quickly cut them all down.\\n\\n Meanwhile the Photographer was struggling to contain the Violet Prince. She was struggling against the threat of universal protogenia, and was still a novice to the powers of the Infinite. In contrast the Prince fought back without fear of consequence. In addition the immortal realm was constantly feeding him energy. It was only a matter of time before Luo Xianni was overcome.\\n\\n Tens of thousands of soldiers were forced to watch. There was nothing they could do. The fight was also being live streamed all across human space. Official channels had been shut down across the North and East, however, as the situation unfolded. Politicians, who’d witnessed Tyrannosaurus being swatted away, had lost any hope of victory. Many were preparing to flee. \\n\\n Perhaps, these people thought, if they got far enough away there was a chance they could survive. Staying would be waiting for death. This new creature and the world it had created was beyond their darkest nightmares.\\n\\n Tendrils of light continued to gather, layer upon layer painted in the four hues of the Banishing Blades. The foundation of the Banishing Strategy was complete. However, pulses of energy revealed that it had become unstable.\\n\\n “Truly pathetic!” Monarch felt something, some inexplicable sense that put him on edge. He waved his right hand and two waves of golden light washed over the Violet Prince and the hydra.\\n\\n Both alien champions experienced a mighty surge in power. Luo Xianni took a head-on punch from the Prince that sent her sprawling. For the others the situation was worse. The Pauper got caught by a direct strike from the abomination and was cut down. His body exploded into dust and was no more. Skyfire Avenue had lost another Paragon.\\n\\n There was no time for sorrow. The three-headed, six-armed monster did not let up. The Keeper and Bookworm exchange a silent but telling glance as their bodies began to glow. Lan Qing had stopped them before. Now it seemed like it was finally their time.\\n\\n Chapter 892: Suppression\\n\\n Suddenly a thick and oppressive aura filled the air.\\n\\n Four beams of light split the sky as they shot up. Turquoise, white, red and blue seemed to paint all the universe. A primitive, almost primordial sensation poured from the columns as they appeared.\\n\\n Four figured previously hidden by the glare were again revealed.\\n\\n Hovering above Lan Jue’s head was Captus, whose length was covered in golden runes. Much like the first time his dharma manifested itself as the Middle Heaven Great Emperor of the North Star of Purple Subtlety, all of the sword’s powers were brought to bear.\\n\\n Lan Qing, Zhou Qianlin and the Pharmacist appeared in similarly resplendent fair. Like Lan Jue, their swords appeared overhead and blazed with golden runes. The cocoon of light that had enveloped them was replaced by a bizarre and motley display. Pure chaos reigned all around them.\\n\\n Monarch, who had just thrown aside caution for curiosity, watched in awe. His pupils contracted to tiny pits of black, for suddenly the nagging sense of danger had become a screaming alarm. The ethereal aura of Europa that he relied on for protection was in danger of scattering like a morning mist before the light of the Banishing Blades.\\n\\n What was this power, that even immortal qi was rendered ineffectual? Did these humans actually possess a way to harm a god?\\n\\n All throughout this conflict with the humans Monarch had carefully planned every step. Even Lan Qing’s victories were part of the alien master’s schemes. Everything had followed the path he laid out. The only thing outside of his control were the Banishing Blades.\\n\\n Monarch even knew when Lan Jue and the Pharmacist had snuck into his planetary person. He’d been curious as to their purpose, what would cause them to undertake such a risk? Why was that sword so important? He hadn’t taken them for granted either, and left his strongest avatar to protect Ultus. However, much to his surprise the sword itself revolted and allowed itself to be pilfered from his very heart.\\n\\n It was the only circumstance to fall outside of his control. The consequences of this oversight was coming back to haunt him.\\n\\n The time for playing with his prey had passed. Monarch leaped forward to try and interrupt the Strategy. Still the size of an average human, he pressed out with his hands toward the chaotic flows amongst the four sword bearers.\\n\\n The golden light emitted from his strike was not overly spectacular. However, the pulse of energy released from him was so intense that all of the Paragons – and the two aliens that aided him – were knocked backward. So intense was the shockwave that the human ships swayed dangerously and threatened to be crushed.\\n\\n They were lost!\\n\\n To Luo Xianni everything went dark. Clearly the Banishing Strategy was not yet completed and Monarch had had time to interrupt it. All was lost, the Strategy was defeated. Humanity’s final hope was too late and the alien home worlds had won!\\n\\n A terrible scream tore through her mind. She felt waves of shock wash over her, including from the Violet Prince and the three-headed avatar. Luo Xianni steeled herself and forced her attention toward the site of the Banishing Strategy where she was greeted with an incredible scene.\\n\\n Monarch’s arms were outstretched and the golden light from his palms hung over the area of the Banishing Strategy. Underneath the canopy of that light the chaos continued to swirl, gently at first until with a thunderous burst it broke free.\\n\\n Even as powerful as Monarch had become, in the moment the power broke through his containment he found himself sluggish – frozen. Unable to move, the flood of pure chaos smashed into him.\\n\\n In the moments following an even stranger spectacle emerged. The golden light that demonstrated Europa’s protection vanished, like snow on a spring morning. It was suppressed! The thought struck Luo Xianni as she watched, and once more hope sprang to life in her chest.\\n\\n The Banishing Strategy was not yet completely set out, and yet even still it was effective. More than effective – it was able to contend against a golden immortal’s direct attack! It meant humanity was not yet doomed.\\n\\n The Violet Prince and his companion gaped at what they witnessed. Both of them had felt the terrifying might of that chaos. Before Monarch had been swallowed up by it they’d felt his intention telling them to attack the sword bearers.\\n\\n Once Monarch had fallen into their clutches Lan Jue and the others began to blaze with light. That realm of unbridled chaos began to shrink once its prey was captured, as though Monarch had been captured in a universe that was rapidly decaying.\\n\\n With a dangerous flash in his eye Lan Jue indicated with his right hand. Captus, which was ringing with the power of the Strategy, released a gust of red power into the stream.\\n\\n Zhou Qianlin was next, and Demortus’ blue light joined. As it mingled with Captus’ intent both were made more powerful. The Banishing Strategy’s already magnificent strength was magnified.\\n\\n Lan Qing and the Pharmacist followed their example, channeling the essence of their swords into the stream. From the outside the Strategy was a riot of color, including the flickering golden light from Monarch. However, that golden light was quickly weakening.\\n\\n Lan Jue and the others stared with intense focus, even as their bodies began to become transparent. With every change of their swords, every burst of light, the results were reflected in their bodies. As the Strategy grew stronger so did they, as though they were bound to it body and soul.\\n\\n The Banishing Strategy became a tempest, fully established and with Monarch the center of its harrowing focus. Next was to let it loose.\\n\\n The Banishing Strategy was stratified into several levels. Lan Jue and his companions were aiming to accomplish only its simplest manifestation. While to the Paragons outside everything was clear and bright, to Lan Jue and the other sword bearers their weapons were insatiable pits that drank everything in.\\n\\n As they continued their struggle to summon the power of the Strategy, the pressure suffered by the Paragons outside only grew. With Monarch caught, the Prince and the avatar fought like wild animals.\\n\\n With the Pauper dead the defenders were reduced to eleven. Luo Xianni was a mighty power on their side, but she could feel universal protogenia imposing its limits on her abilities. It was increasingly more difficult to keep the Violet Prince at bay. And if it was difficult for her, the situation was far more dire for the ten paragons tasked with containing the three-headed avatar.\\n\\n The Driver had emerged as the leader of their defense. He continued to pummel the hydra monster with Primordial lightning, and his Domain spread across the field. It was only thanks to the empyreal quality of his abilities that the avatar was prevented from killing all of them.\\n\\n However, every time that beast attacked it took all ten avatars to beat it back and keep the Domain stable. They were quickly growing tired.\\n\\n Whether it was the Wine Master’s dimensional abilities or the Clockmaker’s control of time, all were limited in their effect on this beast. It was only getting more difficult with time to keep themselves from being destroyed. The slightest mistake could lead to disaster.\\n\\n Suddenly figured emerged on the outskirts of their battlefield. Starlight glinted off the metal hulls of countless mecha suits.\\n\\n Su Xiaosu’s voice rang through every cockpit. “This is it people, life or death. For our families, for our species – with me!”\\n\\n A six-winged mecha streaked passed the encirclement and into the fight. Hundreds of glittering metal warriors followed.\\n\\n They were soldiers from Star Division, from the Bloodiron Khans, and the convert army of the North. They’d already proven themselves in the battle against the alien horde, and now they were on the front lines again.\\n\\n Every one of them knew it was a suicide mission. They were too weak to do anything against an enemy like this. However, if their deaths bought the Paragons even just one extra minute they were glad to die for the cause. Su Xiaosu had made no attempt to hide from them the truth of this mission. If they chose to join the fight, it was likely they wouldn’t make it back.\\n\\n Nonetheless one fifth of recruits answered the call. For Star Division that number was closer to one in three, and among those were every single one of Lan Jue’s former students. An Lun’s Bloodiron Khans also showed up in full force.\\n\\n Indeed none of Lan Qing’s warriors shirked what they felt to be their duty. Though they did not have the individual power of Star Division’s soldiers or the Northern converts, they charged into the fray with a fervor that outshone them all. For their country and their people, they were more than willing to give up their precious lives.\\n\\n At Xiaosu’s call it was the Bloodiron Khans who rushed in first. They arranged themselves into a human wall and cut off the aliens from the Banishing Strategy. They diverted all power to shields and flooded their suits with Discipline. \\n\\n Star Division and the converts were a step behind. They formed up, ready to give their all.\\n\\n Chapter 893: Faith and Fervor!\\n\\n Soldiers throughout the armada looked on with eyes red from emotion. But the surprises were not over.\\n\\n Scores more mecha suites were dispatched from the twelve fleets. All four bastions released their remaining drones to join the fight as well. Every fleet and bastion had a contingent of ground troops and mechas to equip them with. Together with the drones they were a flexible and dynamic fighting force. Yet, their mission was clear in the minds of every pilot; they were cannon fodder.\\n\\n In a matter of moments these brave soldiers created a ring on the outer edge of the Banishing Strategy. They arranged themselves so that the representatives of each adept army were protected as well.\\n\\n Every man and woman, whether in the cockpit of a mecha suit or drone, stared grim faced and red eyed at their foes. They did not attack, for they knew that they could not positively affect this battle beyond using themselves as human shields. Every ounce of energy was poured into shields in preparation for the attacks to come.\\n\\n In this moment they did not fear death.\\n\\n A stifling silence hung over the worlds of man as they watched on their screens. In high-definition they saw these brave warriors preparing to sacrifice their lives for the cause. And a sacrifice it would be, for even though there were only two the soldiers knew they had no hope of defeating enemies that powerful.\\n\\n Despair settled in the hearts of the ruling class, especially the politicians, and many had already fled. However there were some who remained, to wait and see what would happen. These public servants were determined to meet their fate with their constituents.\\n\\n The East’s Chairman Zhou Xueguan was together with the parliament. His hands were curled into tight fists. By his side was the speaker of the parliament, and both men glared ferociously at the images of the screen before them.\\n\\n The parliamentary hall was full, with every representative in attendance. They’d been invited to watch the operation together. They’d cheered Zhou Xueguan as their armies won victory after victory against the alien horde. Now however, with the ascent of Monarch and the display of his might, the hall was silent.\\n\\n When the battle started to turn there were some in the room who sought to slip away. But before they could, the doors to the hall were flung open and soldiers flooded in. They were fully armed, and trained their guns on the politicians. \\n\\n The speaker addressed his comrades with frigid promise, stating that they would die with their people if it came to it. No one would be permitted to leave. They would not be allowed to abandon the East.\\n\\n All of this had been prepared in advance, arranged by Zhou Xueguan and the speaker. They had to assure the people, and they couldn’t do that if the political class was in turmoil. If the leadership could show steadfastness and solidarity, the people’s faith would remain strong.\\n\\n The scene from the parliamentary hall was streamed along with the battle, in a small box on the bottom right corner. In a joint announcement Chairman Zhou and the speaker reassured everyone that their leaders were not going to leave them to their fate.\\n\\n It had the desired affect and the people calmed. They earned no praise, but it did allay fears that they would be abandoned. In their minds if the politicians were in the same situation they were, there was still a chance things could be turned around.\\n\\n Video of Eastern mechas putting themselves in harm’s way were streamed into every household. Pride and tears filled the eyes of citizens as they saw the signature yellow of the Bloodiron Khans arrayed against overwhelming odds. They weren’t afraid, and so neither were the people. Like the soldiers who fought for them they were filled with passion.\\n\\n Eastern soldiers were doing right by their duty to all of humanity. They put themselves in the line of danger, putting down their lives so that their species might have a chance to fight back.\\n\\n Heroes. Every single one of those brave warriors were heroes to all of mankind. Tears flowed down a countless number of faces and many citizens were out in the streets to watch the fight together on enormous screens on the sides of buildings [1. This is typical for many cities in China. Skyscrapers may often come equipped with enormous televisions. They’re used for many purposes; in the summer they have movies on some and street vendors lay out tables were people can watch a movie and have food. They’re also for propaganda and public service announcements. The world cup and Olympics are the time when these outside screens are most popular. However, I think they’re beginning to fall out of style. Here’s an example, though I don’t know why they have it censored.]\\n\\n A silver-haired woman in her twilight years pointed to the enormous screen and cried out. “My son’s out there! He’s one of the Bloodiron Khans!” Her face was wet with tears but she stood tall. Her words, quavering with emotion, betrayed her pride.\\n\\n Similar scenes played out all across the East. Panic was gone, replaced by the undaunted fervor reflected in the eyes of those soldiers. They were a people of singular purpose and unity!\\n\\n People on what remained of the Western Alliance planets were also emotional as they watched. Their government was gone, but after Guanyin the Queen of Heaven saved their fellows – channeled through Zhou Qianlin – they’d felt more inclined toward the East. \\n\\n The stream they were receiving came from the East. When they saw that the Eastern parliament was not fleeing they hung their head in shame.\\n\\n Many of their leaders and politicians had fled Europa even before the aliens attacked. Most of those left behind as victims were common folk without the ability to run. They were forced to wait for the end to claim them.\\n\\n No one wished for the end of this conflict more than the Western people. They had suffered awfully and were tired of conflict. They prayed for the success of the four sword bearers from the East, prayed that they would be victorious over this hated foe. Their hearts were just as impassioned as the narration from the Eastern streaming video.\\n\\n “Look, what are our young comrades doing? They are giving all of themselves so that all of us might be safe. These are our Bloodiron Khans, our An Lun soldiers, our Eastern countrymen. Majesties from Skyfire Avenue fight on the front lines while Star Division and Bloodiron Khan soldiers stand at their backs. Nor do they stand alone, for soldiers from our Eastern army have come to bolster their numbers. I am not a believer, but I pray for these brave souls – pray for our people and our future. Join me in cheering them on and our combined faith will help them win the day. Our enemies will be destroyed.”\\n\\n The rousing speech reverberated all throughout the East and inflamed passions. Through their actions the government and military inspired the people and gave them faith. Even in defeat they would stand in solidarity.\\n\\n This was not the case in the North. They were the mightiest of nations, and as such were rife with powerful political, military and business families. When the situation began to deteriorate these influential people prepared for their exodus. The government did not inspire the same confidence in its people as the East. Though many took faith in the images from the live stream, they were not unified in the way the other Alliances were.\\n\\n As the conflict increased the differences between these alliances became more stark. However no one paid much attention as all eyes were trained on the front lines and the battle that would determine the fate of humanity.\\n\\n ξ\\n\\n Boom! Layers of pink shattered like glass, a dimension fractured. The Photographer was flung away and spat out a mouthful of blood. Her powers changed constantly to match the ever-increasing Domain of Creation and Destruction, barely managing to keep it at bay.\\n\\n The Violet Prince paid her no further mind. He switched directions and launched himself toward the location of the Banishing Strategy. He was loathe to obey Monarch’s command but the newly ascended immortal was master. If Monarch perished the immortal realm they build would disappear. He was also acutely aware that he could not contend against his father’s tremendous power.\\n\\n He witnessed what everyone saw on their screens once he turned toward the Banishing Strategy; it was hidden behind a sphere of metal. Countless mechas and drones were tightly organized so that there was no way to get at the sword bearers except through them. Only the stream of chaotic power was left unguarded, the same stream that had swallowed up Monarch. The Prince had no illusions that he would fare better if he chose that route.\\n\\n The Violet Prince narrowed his eyes as he surveyed the landscape. He grunted and chastised humanity for its naiveté. Did they believe they could stand against him?\\n\\n He rushed forward, fist outstretched. A burst of purple light emerged.\\n\\n A hundred defenders exploded immediately, reduced to burning slag. However the Prince was slowed ever so slightly as he was struck with a surprising thought. These humans were not disheartened. Even in the face of death they persevered!\\n\\n The aliens were adept at psychic communication. He could feel their courage and conviction as clearly as though it had come from him.\\n\\n Chapter 894: Sacrifice\\n\\n A hundred thousand thoughts flooded the Violet Prince’s mind, all the same: Humanity forever! For the North! For the East! Cry after cry of devotion, each one small but together a cacophony. It was so intense it gave him pause.\\n\\n He only managed one attack before Luo Xianni caught up with him.\\n\\n In the same instant two incandescent beams of light exploded forth. The dazzling beams were birthed from what appeared to be binary stars burning one beside the other. The focused fury of their dual supernovae were focused on the three-headed avatar.\\n\\n The mad laughter of the Keeper and the Bookworm hung in the air, audible to all. Their dharmas appeared beside them, for in the final moments of their lives as they channeled their vital essence into the attack they broke through to a new level. Like the Pontiff their sacrifice empowered them to be Reflections of Heaven and Earth.\\n\\n Tears wet the eyes of every member of Skyfire Avenue, Paragon and Division soldier alike. These men were pillars of the Avenue, of the East as a whole. Echoes of their contributions would persist far into humanity’s future – if they had a future.\\n\\n It was the two of them who first puzzled out the secrets of the exuvium process, using vital crystals to extend life. It was them who pushed the East forward technologically so they would not fall too far behind the North. Now, they used the last light of their lives in a final service to their people.\\n\\n The splendor of their sacrifice shone all across the universe.\\n\\n The hydra abomination was shocked by the turn of events. By itself the beast could defend against the blasts, but the will and spirit of these old men surged tenfold. Faced with such conviction, the avatar paused.\\n\\n Half a moment later the beast was swallowed up by the beams of light. Under the blaze its body was torn apart and put back together half a dozen times.\\n\\n The Wine Master watched, holding tightly to the Clockmaker’s hand, his face pale. He’d known the Keeper for so long, the old scientist was more senior among the Avenue’s leadership. When the Clairvoyant passed, it should have been the Keeper to take over the duties of chairman. However the Keeper refused, stating only that he didn’t have the time. Thus the responsibility passed onto the Wine Master.\\n\\n He was selfless. He put the prosperity of Skyfire Avenue and the East as a whole before himself, to the very end!\\n\\n The Wine Master cast a glance to the Clockmaker at his side. “I’m sorry.”\\n\\n She smiled back at him, her free hand fiddling with the small clock she carried with her. She gripped his hand tighter. “What are you saying? You think I’m less dedicated than you?”\\n\\n He smiled back. “I’ve loved you my whole life. It took me an eternity to earn your heart, but it is my greatest achievement. If another life awaits us I will meet it gladly, and I’ll be more brazen the second go-round.”\\n\\n As they spoke, looking deeply into one another’s eyes, light began to flicker around them. Flashes of silver radiated from the Wine Master and his scepter. A smear of multicolor light hung over the Clockmaker. She flung her small clock into space where it dissolved into a golden beam, and was caught in the flows of space-time that surrounded them.\\n\\n The avatar was too strong. Though the scientists’ sacrifice had managed to contain it temporarily they could not destroy it. More power was needed.\\n\\n When the Wine Master said sorry to his love he’d made up his mind. He was the chairman of Skyfire Avenue’s council, he had a responsibility.\\n\\n Sacrificing one’s life for humanity was a fine period on the final sentence of his life. His only regret was leaving the wonderful woman by his side. Her calm in the face of the end, her small comforting smile, eased the sorrow in his heart. They were together at the finale of their lives, two hearts beating as one. Together they would deliver a crushing blow on behalf of mankind.\\n\\n “This sort of thing is the responsibility of us old folk.” The words were almost lackadaisical, delivered from another figure standing on the Wine Master’s other side. A crystalline vine, pulsing with protogenia.\\n\\n “You’re a lover of wine, and our legacy has to be passed on. It’s a treasure that belongs to everyone.” Two streaks of light flit passed the Wine Master, one purple and one red. They raced toward the dual columns of white.\\n\\n The Gods of Wine, Bize and Aubert. \\n\\n “I finally feel like I’m worthy of meeting Henri in the afterlife. I’m a hero, now – he can’t steal you away from me. Hahahaha!” Aubert’s laughter was coarse, making Bize’s cheeks red.\\n\\n A deep purple light spread forth form Aubert, turning the branches sprouting from him into crystal extensions. A rich scent of wine filled the air. In all his life the Wine Master had never smelled anything so wonderful.\\n\\n Purple and ring intermingled, and as they drilled into the light they became a magnificent spear.\\n\\n POP! A sound like a balloon exploding rang out. The whole area seemed to shake as red, white and purple sparkled so brightly it painted the whole galaxy.\\n\\n Boom--! A ripping explosion followed.\\n\\n The lights dimmed and a body hung in space. It was the three-headed avatar. The Keeper, Bookworm, and the two Gods of Wine were gone without a trace.\\n\\n But did their target still live?\\n\\n Four Paragons gave their lives to destroy a single creature, but it still didn’t seem enough. It spoke to how terrible its power really was.\\n\\n However their sacrifice wasn’t entirely in vain. The three-headed monster had but one head remaining, two thirds of what had created it were destroyed. Its power was still roughly equivalent to the Infinite, but compared to the near immortal level might it’d commanded before this was a sharp decline. The remains of its battered body continuously leaked a thick purple fluid and branches could be seen embedded in its back. The wounds and branches leached out the life blood of the monster, making it weaker.\\n\\n “Kill it!” The Wine Master shouted. He charged in to put the beast down.\\n\\n The Pauper was gone, as was the Keeper, the Bookworm, Bize and Aubert. Only six Paragons were left, standing between the enemy and the Banishing Strategy.\\n\\n The Gourmet, Driver, Wine Master, Clockmaker, Hua Li, and Chu Cheng were all that were left.\\n\\n They dashed forward, a flood of rage, sadness and determination. Chu Cheng swiped at the avatar with Hade’s Falchion, which glinted with a bitter and forlorn glow. With no time to recover before the Paragons were on it, the beast was cut deep by the weapon.\\n\\n Orbs of blue and gold erupted from Hua Li’s trident. They surrounded the creature and slowed it down. Primordial lightning, dimensional daggers and weaponized time-element struck all at once. \\n\\n Blood shot out like a geyser, but the avatar still stood. Even heavily damaged it contrived to summon what remained of its Domain to block the brunt of the attacks. It knocked the Wine Master away.\\n\\n Things were looking bad for Luo Xianni. Her powers were suffering after the wound she’d sustained from the Prince. It was only getting easier for her foe to cast off her attacks and turn his focus on his real target.\\n\\n Every time the Prince repelled her he lashed out at the Banishing Strategy. Each attack destroyed hundreds more mechas and drones. Were it not for Luo Xianni’s persistence he would make quick work of these piddling defenders. \\n\\n Yet as their comrades died more mechas and drones surged into the breach to take their place. They were ready for a glorious death, to give themselves for victory. The Banishing Strategy was in the midst of establishing mankind’s last chance. The least they could do – the only thing they could do – was whatever they could to see it succeed.\\n\\n “Die!” The Violet Prince roared. He sent Luo Xianni flying once again. Her chest was visibly collapsed, her protogenia could no longer protect her. Her camera was damaged beyond repair.\\n\\n Her expression crestfallen, a bronze light flickered as Jue Di’s former weapon appeared in her grip. She clutched the Compliant Rod desperately.\\n\\n “Chi Bupang, I’m coming to join you. Don’t forget me.” She whispered through lungs rapidly filling with blood.\\n\\n Luo Xianni threw the rod into the air. Then, aiming her camera, she focused on the Prince as he raced toward the Banishing Strategy. As he began to tear through the mechas and drones, she muttered through gritted teeth. \\n\\n “Take… advice… from Luo Xianni. A camera… is all you need.”\\n\\n She fought to speak the words, each syllable causing her small pink camera to grow more dim and intangible. A fading violet light arose from her concave chest and merged with the fading astrum.\\n\\n Chapter 895: One Final Photograph\\n\\n Blood trickled from the corners of Luo Xianni’s mouth and dripped onto her camera. Suddenly it flashed with an intense pink light that made her stand out against the darkness of space.\\n\\n The Violet Prince, in the midst of his charge, sensed something and spun around. When his eyes fell on Luo Xianni, his pupils contracted.\\n\\n Ka-cha! The unmistakable sound of a camera shutter clicked. Everything froze.\\n\\n The Violet Prince was stuck with a hand raised, ready to launch another attack at her. He fluttered through invisible gravitational waves as a two-dimensional image.\\n\\n Luo Xianni’s body was pink from head to toe and somewhat opaque. It made her all the more beautiful and ethereal, like an angel. Strangely she also looked much younger, perhaps only fifteen or so.\\n\\n “Chi Bupang…. Chi Bupang you bastard, you dare jilt me. You just wait, I’ll fight for you all the rest of my life!” She smiled as she muttered the words, a recollection from years ago.\\n\\n The Prince’s picturesque image floated over to her and with great difficulty she lifted her arms. Pinching the top of the photo she began to tear.\\n\\n A flood of energy so intense it was frightening poured from the photograph, a sign of the Prince’s struggle. Luo Xianni’s pink-hued body shone brighter.\\n\\n Crack! The dainty camera she carried with her shattered into dust.\\n\\n Ssshhhrrrip! She tore off one edge of the picture, containing the Prince’s arm. She cast the torn section away and it dissolved into ash.\\n\\n She pinched again and began to pull. Her aim was his head.\\n\\n “Aaaarrrrrgggghh!!!” A bloodcurdling roar burst forth, followed by a surge of violet light that tried to smother Luo Xianni’s pink glow. Her body warped in response and flickered with a rose tint. The violet aura solidified and was blocked from expanding, she refused to let him escape.\\n\\n “My children, this is as much as your mother can offer. Don’t give up!” Her voice was not pained, or sad. Instead she sounded almost jovial. She sounded relaxed. Indeed, she was off to find her love, she hadn’t been happy since Jue Di’s passing. At last she could put down her burden and look for the partner she’d lost.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n **\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n Within the Banishing Strategy.\\n\\n Tears flowed freely from Lan Jue, Lan Qing and Zhou Qianlin’s faces. They put their all toward establishing the Strategy, but they saw everything that was happening outside. They were forced to watch silently as soldiers from Star Division, the Bloodiron Khans and the convert army gave their lives. They were acutely affected by the deaths of the Keeper, Bookworm, and the Gods of Wine.\\n\\n Every one of them gave their lives to buy them time. They sacrificed themselves for final victory!\\n\\n The Banishing Strategy fought perpetually against the might of Monarch. But this Strategy was designed to contend against the strongest immortals in history, one of the greatest forces of the universe. Even the simplest manifestation of it was a threat to Monarch’s life.\\n\\n Unless the Strategy failed, Monarch wasn’t getting away.\\n\\n The Banishing Strategy had only been attempted once before, by four of the greatest warriors to have ever lived. Among them were legendary Celestial Masters Yuanshi and Taishang!\\n\\n Lan Jue could feel himself weakening. His protogenia, energy, and life force were being drained by the sword. But he was ready – they were determined to give their lives for the Strategy to succeed.\\n\\n However it was difficult beyond words to watch his friends, his family, his soldiers fall one after the other. The burden it put on him was crushing, and reached its peak when he heard Luo Xianni’s parting words. Even Lan Qing, always a rock in the most unstable times, had tears running down his face. But they couldn’t help, all they could do was continue to focus all of their strength on the Strategy.\\n\\n Light from the four swords continued to oscillate around them. They carved out channels of energy as they build the foundation. Erratic tempests of deadly sword energy whipped all around. When they brought it under control, the Strategy would be complete.\\n\\n Upon being captured by the power of the Strategy, Monarch was filled with fear. Immediately he sensed the aura of immortality protecting him get stripped away. He was left exposed, and if the universe discovered him he would be subject to the terrible power of universal protogenia. \\n\\n However as time stretched on he found that universal protogenia was no threat to him under the cover of the Strategy. On the contrary, he sensed something altogether different here. The energy that assailed him was completely different from anything he’d experienced before. Its burden was incredible, outstripping even his own Domain. The revelation opened his eyes.\\n\\n What in the world was this mysterious power? Its turbid, agitated influence was capable of locking out everything outside and yet offered no physical threat.\\n\\n Monarch and his species were adept at consumption and adaptation. He’d grown to these lofty heights thanks to this skill. Naturally his first instinct was to try and absorb this power for himself and see if it could be used to his benefit. \\n\\n Starting small, he drew in a portion and tried to assimilate it but hastily cast it back. Although the small dose was weak he could sense the grade of this energy was towering beyond limit. Taking in even the slightest amount was met with a violent and immediate rejection that threatening to destroy him from inside.\\n\\n What frightening power! If only he could somehow command it, he wondered, to what heights would be climb?\\n\\n Monarch mulled over the problem, searching for some way to consume this inexplicable force. As he did, the tinge of fear that had assailed him before was gone. After exploring his surroundings with his senses he did not fear for himself, not against these four insignificant humans. He was a god amongst men, and with Luo Xianni’s demise none among them commanded the power of the Infinite. Even this strange power that had him temporarily suspended was causing no damage. Who remained to stand against him?\\n\\n Monarch was a creature of supreme ambition. His target was to supplant the universe itself. He was both curious and fascinated by this new type of energy and thus did not hurry to free himself from it. Instead he followed its ebb and flow, confident that he could discover its secrets. Secrets that would guide him on the path to domination.\\n\\n As a result Lan Jue and the others did not sense Monarch struggling. Little by little, they were free to establish their Strategy. However it was more than just the death of Luo Xianni that filled their hearts with sadness. Despair was beginning to set in.\\n\\n They could not complete the Strategy! This unspoken fear grew within each of the four sword bearers. They were nearing their limit and yet not even a third of the Strategy’s foundation was complete. Even if they spent every drop of vitality remaining within them they could not see a way to give what the Strategy demanded. In the end they would be consumed by the power they sought to command, Monarch would escape unscathed.\\n\\n Half of humanity’s mightiest had already fallen and they were failing. After all of this, was it truly the fate of mankind to be destroyed by these monsters?\\n\\n Lan Qing’s voice called to the other three. “Do not give up, even to the last moment. Give up everything and we will see what can be accomplished. His aura of protection is gone, and even if we only succeed in injuring him perhaps universe protogenia can do the rest.”\\n\\n “Alright!” Lan Jue answered. His eyes, burning with resolve, never left Zhou Qianlin.\\n\\n While Monarch couldn’t see through the chaotic flows of energy, to the sword bearers it was clear as water. It was carried by the swords, but was present at the creation of the universe. Lan Jue’s Five Lightnings were a derivative of this primordial power. This pure chaos was a profound and eternal aspect of reality. Of course Monarch would know nothing of it.\\n\\n Lan Jue took a deep breath and from his Core a bright light emerged. An image of the Middle Heaven Great Emperor of the North Star of Purple Subtlety appeared behind. Hundreds of twinkling star-like lights appeared upon Lan Jue and set his body ablaze.\\n\\n He offered himself as a sacrifice to the Banishing Blade, urging it to give them more power. Lan Qing, Zhou Qianlin and the Pharmacist did the same.\\n\\n In response all four swords flared and burned like four suns. The Strategy began to arrange itself faster. Monarch, who had been carefully examining the power, felt it suddenly press heavily upon him. The load it placed on him took his breath away.\\n\\n “Impossible!” It wa the first thought to cross his mind. How could this insignificant creatures summon something so exceptional?\\n\\n Golden light radiated from him as he fought to stave off the pressure. The chaos around him rippled but was otherwise unchanged.\\n\\n Something like fear flashed in Monarch’s eyes. No, he couldn’t hold back any longer. If they were allowed to use even a fraction of this power against him it would threaten his life.\\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/skyfire-avenue/sfl-chapter-891","bookId":1509,"book":{"id":1509,"title":"Skyfire Avenue","description":"天火大道, aka Skyfire Avenue, is a scifi/fantasy webnovel by popular Chinese author Third Young Master of the Tang Family, aka Tang Jia San Shao (唐家三少), the same author who wrote Douluo Dalu.
