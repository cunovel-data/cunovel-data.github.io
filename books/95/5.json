{"id":2429,"no":5,"title":"Chapter 5","content":"5:1 [hgb] 基 督 释 放 了 我 们 ， 叫 我 们 得 以 自 由 ， 所 以 要 站 立 得 稳 ， 不 要 再 被 奴 仆 的 轭 挟 制 。 [kjv] Stand fast therefore in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage. [bbe] Christ has truly made us free: then keep your free condition and let no man put a yoke on you again. 5:2 [hgb] 我 保 罗 告 诉 你 们 ， 若 受 割 礼 ， 基 督 就 与 你 们 无 益 了 。 [kjv] Behold, I Paul say unto you, that if ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing. [bbe] See, I Paul say to you, that if you undergo circumcision, Christ will be of no use to you. 5:3 [hgb] 我 再 指 着 凡 受 割 礼 的 人 确 实 地 说 ， 他 是 欠 着 行 全 律 法 的 债 。 [kjv] For I testify again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law. [bbe] Yes, I give witness again to every man who undergoes circumcision, that he will have to keep all the law. 5:4 [hgb] 你 们 这 要 靠 律 法 称 义 的 ， 是 与 基 督 隔 绝 ， 从 恩 典 中 坠 落 了 。 [kjv] Christ is become of no effect unto you, whosoever of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace. [bbe] You are cut off from Christ, you who would have righteousness by the law; you are turned away from grace. 5:5 [hgb] 我 们 靠 着 圣 灵 ， 凭 着 信 心 ， 等 候 所 盼 望 的 义 。 [kjv] For we through the Spirit wait for the hope of righteousness by faith. [bbe] For we through the Spirit by faith are waiting for the hope of righteousness. 5:6 [hgb] 原 来 在 基 督 耶 稣 里 ， 受 割 礼 不 受 割 礼 ， 全 无 功 效 。 惟 独 使 人 生 发 仁 爱 的 信 心 ， 才 有 功 效 。 [kjv] For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which worketh by love. [bbe] Because in Christ Jesus, having circumcision or not having circumcision are equally of no profit; but only faith working through love. 5:7 [hgb] 你 们 向 来 跑 得 好 。 有 谁 拦 阻 你 们 ， 叫 你 们 不 顺 从 真 理 呢 ？ [kjv] Ye did run well; who did hinder you that ye should not obey the truth? [bbe] You were going on well; who was the cause of your not giving ear to what is true? 5:8 [hgb] 这 样 的 劝 导 ， 不 是 出 于 那 召 你 们 的 。 [kjv] This persuasion cometh not of him that calleth you. [bbe] This ready belief did not come from him who had made you his. 5:9 [hgb] 一 点 面 酵 能 使 全 团 都 发 起 来 。 [kjv] A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump. [bbe] A little leaven makes a change in all the mass. 5:10 [hgb] 我 在 主 里 很 信 你 们 必 不 怀 别 样 的 心 ， 但 搅 扰 你 们 的 ， 无 论 是 谁 ， 必 担 当 他 的 罪 名 。 [kjv] I have confidence in you through the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be. [bbe] I am certain about you in the Lord, that you will be of no other mind; but he who is troubling you will have his punishment, whoever he is. 5:11 [hgb] 弟 兄 们 ， 我 若 仍 旧 传 割 礼 ， 为 什 么 还 受 逼 迫 呢 ？ 若 是 这 样 ， 那 十 字 架 讨 厌 的 地 方 就 没 有 了 。 [kjv] And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet suffer persecution? then is the offence of the cross ceased. [bbe] But I, brothers, if I am still preaching circumcision, why am I still attacked? then has the shame of the cross been taken away. 5:12 [hgb] 恨 不 得 那 搅 乱 你 们 的 人 ， 把 自 己 割 绝 了 。 [kjv] I would they were even cut off which trouble you. [bbe] My desire is that they who give you trouble might even be cut off themselves. 5:13 [hgb] 弟 兄 们 ， 你 们 蒙 召 ， 是 要 得 自 由 。 只 是 不 可 将 你 们 的 自 由 当 作 放 纵 情 欲 的 机 会 。 总 要 用 爱 心 互 相 服 事 。 [kjv] For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another. [bbe] Because you, brothers, were marked out to be free; only do not make use of your free condition to give the flesh its chance, but through love be servants one to another. 5:14 [hgb] 因 为 全 律 法 都 包 在 爱 人 如 己 这 一 句 话 之 内 了 。 [kjv] For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. [bbe] For all the law is made complete in one word, even in this, Have love for your neighbour as for yourself. 5:15 [hgb] 你 们 要 谨 慎 。 若 相 咬 相 吞 ， 只 怕 要 彼 此 消 灭 了 。 [kjv] But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another. [bbe] But if you are given to fighting with one another, take care that you are not the cause of destruction one to another. 5:16 [hgb] 我 说 ， 你 们 当 顺 着 圣 灵 而 行 ， 就 不 放 纵 肉 体 的 情 欲 了 。 [kjv] This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh. [bbe] But I say, Go on in the Spirit, and you will not come under the rule of the evil desires of the flesh. 5:17 [hgb] 因 为 情 欲 和 圣 灵 相 争 ， 圣 灵 和 情 欲 相 争 。 这 两 个 是 彼 此 相 敌 ， 使 你 们 不 能 作 所 愿 意 作 的 。 [kjv] For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that ye cannot do the things that ye would. [bbe] For the flesh has desires against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; because these are opposite the one to the other; so that you may not do the things which you have a mind to do. 5:18 [hgb] 但 你 们 若 被 圣 灵 引 导 ， 就 不 在 律 法 以 下 。 [kjv] But if ye be led of the Spirit, ye are not under the law. [bbe] But if you are guided by the Spirit, you are not under the law. 5:19 [hgb] 情 欲 的 事 ， 都 是 显 而 易 见 的 。 就 如 奸 淫 ， 污 秽 ， 邪 荡 ， [kjv] Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, [bbe] Now the works of the flesh are clear, which are these: evil desire, unclean things, wrong use of the senses, 5:20 [hgb] 拜 偶 像 ， 邪 术 ， 仇 恨 ， 争 竞 ， 忌 恨 ， 恼 怒 ， 结 党 ， 纷 争 ， 异 端 ， [kjv] Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, [bbe] Worship of images, use of strange powers, hates, fighting, desire for what another has, angry feelings, attempts to get the better of others, divisions, false teachings, 5:21 [hgb] 嫉 妒 ， （ 有 古 卷 在 此 有 凶 杀 二 字 ） 醉 酒 ， 荒 宴 等 类 ， 我 从 前 告 诉 你 们 ， 现 在 又 告 诉 你 们 ， 行 这 样 事 的 人 ， 必 不 能 承 受 神 的 国 。 [kjv] Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. [bbe] Envy, uncontrolled drinking and feasting, and such things: of which I give you word clearly, even as I did in the past, that they who do such things will have no part in the kingdom of God. 5:22 [hgb] 圣 灵 所 结 的 果 子 ， 就 是 仁 爱 ， 喜 乐 ， 和 平 ， 忍 耐 ， 恩 慈 ， 良 善 ， 信 实 ， [kjv] But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, [bbe] But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, a quiet mind, kind acts, well-doing, faith, 5:23 [hgb] 温 柔 ， 节 制 。 这 样 的 事 ， 没 有 律 法 禁 止 。 [kjv] Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law. [bbe] Gentle behaviour, control over desires: against such there is no law. 5:24 [hgb] 凡 属 基 督 耶 稣 的 人 ， 是 已 经 把 肉 体 ， 连 肉 体 的 邪 情 私 欲 ， 同 钉 在 十 字 架 上 了 。 [kjv] And they that are Christ\u0027s have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts. [bbe] And those who are Christ\u0027s have put to death on the cross the flesh with its passions and its evil desires. 5:25 [hgb] 我 们 若 是 靠 圣 灵 得 生 ， 就 当 靠 圣 灵 行 事 。 [kjv] If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit. [bbe] If we are living by the Spirit, by the Spirit let us be guided. 5:26 [hgb] 不 要 贪 图 虚 名 ， 彼 此 惹 气 ， 互 相 嫉 妒 。 [kjv] Let us not be desirous of vain glory, provoking one another, envying one another. [bbe] Let us not be full of self-glory, making one another angry, having envy of one another.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/166/2272.html","bookId":95,"book":{"id":95,"title":"加拉太书 Galatians","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 作 使 徒 的 保 罗 ， （ 不 是 由 于 人 ， 也 不 是 借 着 人 ， 乃 是 借 着 耶 稣 基 督 ， 与 叫 他 从 死 里 复 活 的 父 神 ） [kjv] Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/166","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:15 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:30 AM"}}
