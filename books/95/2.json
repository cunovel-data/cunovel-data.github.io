{"id":2426,"no":2,"title":"Chapter 2","content":"2:1 [hgb] 过 了 十 四 年 ， 我 同 巴 拿 巴 又 上 耶 路 撒 冷 去 ， 并 带 着 提 多 同 去 。 \n [kjv] Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with me also. \n [bbe] Then after the space of fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus with me. \n 2:2 [hgb] 我 是 奉 启 示 上 去 的 ， 把 我 在 外 邦 人 中 所 传 的 福 音 ， 对 弟 兄 们 陈 说 。 却 是 背 地 里 对 那 有 名 望 之 人 说 的 。 惟 恐 我 现 在 ， 或 是 从 前 ， 徒 然 奔 跑 。 \n [kjv] And I went up by revelation, and communicated unto them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain. \n [bbe] And I went up by revelation; and I put before them the good news which I was preaching among the Gentiles, but privately before those who were of good name, so that the work which I was or had been doing might not be without effect. \n 2:3 [hgb] 但 与 我 同 去 的 提 多 ， 虽 是 希 利 尼 人 ， 也 没 有 勉 强 他 受 割 礼 。 \n [kjv] But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised: \n [bbe] But not even Titus who was with me, being a Greek, was made to undergo circumcision: \n 2:4 [hgb] 因 为 有 偷 着 引 进 来 的 假 弟 兄 ， 私 下 窥 探 我 们 在 基 督 耶 稣 里 的 自 由 ， 要 叫 我 们 作 奴 仆 。 \n [kjv] And that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage: \n [bbe] And that because of the false brothers let in secretly, who came searching out our free condition which we have in Christ Jesus, so that they might make servants of us; \n 2:5 [hgb] 我 们 就 是 一 刻 的 工 夫 ， 也 没 有 容 让 顺 服 他 们 ， 为 要 叫 福 音 的 真 理 仍 存 在 你 们 中 间 。 \n [kjv] To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you. \n [bbe] To whom we gave way not even for an hour; so that the true words of the good news might still be with you. \n 2:6 [hgb] 至 于 那 些 有 名 望 的 ， 不 论 他 是 何 等 人 ， 都 与 我 无 干 。 神 不 以 外 貌 取 人 。 那 些 有 名 望 的 ， 并 没 有 加 增 我 什 么 。 \n [kjv] But of these who seemed to be somewhat, (whatsoever they were, it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth no man\u0027s person:) for they who seemed to be somewhat in conference added nothing to me: \n [bbe] But from those who seemed to be important (whatever they were has no weight with me: God does not take man\u0027s person into account): those who seemed to be important gave nothing new to me; \n 2:7 [hgb] 反 倒 看 见 了 主 托 我 传 福 音 给 那 未 受 割 礼 的 人 ， 正 如 托 彼 得 传 福 音 给 那 受 割 礼 的 人 。 \n [kjv] But contrariwise, when they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed unto me, as the gospel of the circumcision was unto Peter; \n [bbe] But, quite the opposite, when they saw that I had been made responsible for preaching the good news to those without circumcision, even as Peter had been for those of the circumcision \n 2:8 [hgb] （ 那 感 动 彼 得 ， 叫 他 为 受 割 礼 之 人 作 使 徒 的 ， 也 感 动 我 ， 叫 我 为 外 邦 人 作 使 徒 ） \n [kjv] (For he that wrought effectually in Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles:) \n [bbe] (Because he who was working in Peter as the Apostle of the circumcision was working no less in me among the Gentiles); \n 2:9 [hgb] 又 知 道 所 赐 给 我 的 恩 典 ， 那 称 为 教 会 柱 石 的 雅 各 ， 矶 法 ， 约 翰 ， 就 向 我 和 巴 拿 巴 用 右 手 行 相 交 之 礼 ， 叫 我 们 往 外 邦 人 那 里 去 ， 他 们 往 受 割 礼 的 人 那 里 去 。 \n [kjv] And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go unto the heathen, and they unto the circumcision. \n [bbe] When they saw the grace which was given to me, James and Cephas and John, who had the name of being pillars, gave to me and Barnabas their right hands as friends so that we might go to the Gentiles, and they to the circumcision; \n 2:10 [hgb] 只 是 愿 意 我 们 记 念 穷 人 。 这 也 是 我 本 来 热 心 去 行 的 。 \n [kjv] Only they would that we should remember the poor; the same which I also was forward to do. \n [bbe] Only it was their desire that we would give thought to the poor; which very thing I had much in mind to do. \n 2:11 [hgb] 后 来 矶 法 到 了 安 提 阿 ， 因 他 有 可 责 之 处 ， 我 就 当 面 抵 挡 他 。 \n [kjv] But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed. \n [bbe] But when Cephas came to Antioch, I made a protest against him to his face, because he was clearly in the wrong. \n 2:12 [hgb] 从 雅 各 那 里 来 的 人 ， 未 到 以 先 ， 他 和 外 邦 人 一 同 吃 饭 。 及 至 他 们 来 到 ， 他 因 怕 奉 割 礼 的 人 ， 就 退 去 与 外 邦 人 隔 开 了 。 \n [kjv] For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them which were of the circumcision. \n [bbe] For before certain men came from James, he did take food with the Gentiles: but when they came, he went back and made himself separate, fearing those who were of the circumcision. \n 2:13 [hgb] 其 余 的 犹 太 人 ， 也 都 随 着 他 装 假 。 甚 至 连 巴 拿 巴 也 随 伙 装 假 。 \n [kjv] And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that Barnabas also was carried away with their dissimulation. \n [bbe] And the rest of the Jews went after him, so that even Barnabas was overcome by their false ways. \n 2:14 [hgb] 但 我 一 看 见 他 们 行 得 不 正 ， 与 福 音 的 真 理 不 合 ， 就 在 众 人 面 前 对 矶 法 说 ， 你 既 是 犹 太 人 ， 若 随 外 邦 人 行 事 ， 不 随 犹 太 人 行 事 ， 怎 么 还 勉 强 外 邦 人 随 犹 太 人 呢 ？ \n [kjv] But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Peter before them all, If thou, being a Jew, livest after the manner of Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, why compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews? \n [bbe] But when I saw that they were not living uprightly in agreement with the true words of the good news, I said to Cephas before them all, If you, being a Jew, are living like the Gentiles, and not like the Jews, how will you make the Gentiles do the same as the Jews? \n 2:15 [hgb] 我 们 这 生 来 的 犹 太 人 ， 不 是 外 邦 的 罪 人 ， \n [kjv] We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles, \n [bbe] We being Jews by birth, and not sinners of the Gentiles, \n 2:16 [hgb] 既 知 道 人 称 义 ， 不 是 因 行 律 法 ， 乃 是 因 信 耶 稣 基 督 ， 连 我 们 也 信 了 基 督 耶 稣 ， 使 我 们 因 信 基 督 称 义 ， 不 因 行 律 法 称 义 ， 因 为 凡 有 血 气 的 ， 没 有 一 人 因 行 律 法 称 义 。 \n [kjv] Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified. \n [bbe] Being conscious that a man does not get righteousness by the works of the law, but through faith in Jesus Christ, we had faith in Christ Jesus, so that we might get righteousness by faith in Christ, and not by the works of the law: because by the works of the law will no flesh get righteousness. \n 2:17 [hgb] 我 们 若 求 在 基 督 里 称 义 ， 却 仍 旧 是 罪 人 ， 难 道 基 督 是 叫 人 犯 罪 的 吗 ？ 断 乎 不 是 。 \n [kjv] But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, is therefore Christ the minister of sin? God forbid. \n [bbe] But if, while we were desiring to get righteousness through Christ, we ourselves were seen to be sinners, is Christ a servant of sin? In no way! \n 2:18 [hgb] 我 素 来 所 拆 毁 的 ， 若 重 新 建 造 ， 这 就 证 明 自 己 是 犯 罪 的 人 。 \n [kjv] For if I build again the things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor. \n [bbe] For if I put up again those things which I gave to destruction, I am seen to be a wrongdoer. \n 2:19 [hgb] 我 因 律 法 就 向 律 法 死 了 ， 叫 我 可 以 向 神 活 着 。 \n [kjv] For I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live unto God. \n [bbe] For I, through the law, have become dead to the law, so that I might be living to God. \n 2:20 [hgb] 我 已 经 与 基 督 同 钉 十 字 架 。 现 在 活 着 的 ， 不 再 是 我 ， 乃 是 基 督 在 我 里 面 活 着 。 并 且 我 如 今 在 肉 身 活 着 ， 是 因 信 神 的 儿 子 而 活 ， 他 是 爱 我 ， 为 我 舍 己 。 \n [kjv] I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me. \n [bbe] I have been put to death on the cross with Christ; still I am living; no longer I, but Christ is living in me; and that life which I now am living in the flesh I am living by faith, the faith of the Son of God, who in love for me, gave himself up for me. \n 2:21 [hgb] 我 不 废 掉 神 的 恩 。 义 若 是 借 着 律 法 得 的 ， 基 督 就 是 徒 然 死 了 。 \n [kjv] I do not frustrate the grace of God: for if righteousness come by the law, then Christ is dead in vain. \n [bbe] I do not make the grace of God of no effect: because if righteousness is through the law, then Christ was put to death for nothing. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/166/2269.html","bookId":95,"book":{"id":95,"title":"加拉太书 Galatians","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 作 使 徒 的 保 罗 ， （ 不 是 由 于 人 ， 也 不 是 借 着 人 ， 乃 是 借 着 耶 稣 基 督 ， 与 叫 他 从 死 里 复 活 的 父 神 ） [kjv] Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/166","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:15 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:30 AM"}}
