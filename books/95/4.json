{"id":2428,"no":4,"title":"Chapter 4","content":"4:1 [hgb] 我 说 那 承 受 产 业 的 ， 虽 然 是 全 业 的 主 人 ， 但 为 孩 童 的 时 候 ， 却 与 奴 仆 毫 无 分 别 。 \n [kjv] Now I say, That the heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant, though he be lord of all; \n [bbe] But I say that as long as the son is a child, he is in no way different from a servant, though he is lord of all; \n 4:2 [hgb] 乃 在 师 傅 和 管 家 的 手 下 ， 直 等 他 父 亲 预 定 的 时 候 来 到 。 \n [kjv] But is under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father. \n [bbe] But is under keepers and managers till the time fixed by the father. \n 4:3 [hgb] 我 们 为 孩 童 的 时 候 ， 受 管 于 世 俗 小 学 之 下 ， 也 是 如 此 。 \n [kjv] Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world: \n [bbe] So we, when we were young, were kept under the first rules of the world; \n 4:4 [hgb] 及 至 时 候 满 足 ， 神 就 差 遣 他 的 儿 子 ， 为 女 子 所 生 ， 且 生 在 律 法 以 下 ， \n [kjv] But when the fulness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, \n [bbe] But when the time had come, God sent out his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, \n 4:5 [hgb] 要 把 律 法 以 下 的 人 赎 出 来 ， 叫 我 们 得 着 儿 子 的 名 分 。 \n [kjv] To redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons. \n [bbe] That he might make them free who were under the law, and that we might be given the place of sons. \n 4:6 [hgb] 你 们 既 为 儿 子 ， 神 就 差 他 儿 子 的 灵 ， 进 入 你 们 （ 原 文 作 我 们 ） 的 心 ， 呼 叫 阿 爸 ， 父 。 \n [kjv] And because ye are sons, God hath sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father. \n [bbe] And because you are sons, God has sent out the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, saying, Abba, Father. \n 4:7 [hgb] 可 见 ， 从 此 以 后 ， 你 不 是 奴 仆 ， 乃 是 儿 子 了 。 既 是 儿 子 ， 就 靠 着 神 为 后 嗣 。 \n [kjv] Wherefore thou art no more a servant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ. \n [bbe] So that you are no longer a servant, but a son; and if a son, then the heritage of God is yours. \n 4:8 [hgb] 但 从 前 你 们 不 认 识 神 的 时 候 ， 是 给 那 些 本 来 不 是 神 的 作 奴 仆 。 \n [kjv] Howbeit then, when ye knew not God, ye did service unto them which by nature are no gods. \n [bbe] But at that time, having no knowledge of God, you were servants to those who by right are no gods: \n 4:9 [hgb] 现 在 你 们 既 然 认 识 神 ， 更 可 说 是 被 神 所 认 识 的 ， 怎 么 还 要 归 回 那 懦 弱 无 用 的 小 学 ， 情 愿 再 给 它 作 奴 仆 呢 ？ \n [kjv] But now, after that ye have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage? \n [bbe] But now that you have come to have knowledge of God, or more truly, God has knowledge of you, how is it that you go back again to the poor and feeble first things, desiring to be servants to them again? \n 4:10 [hgb] 你 们 谨 守 日 子 ， 月 分 ， 节 期 ， 年 分 。 \n [kjv] Ye observe days, and months, and times, and years. \n [bbe] You keep days, and months, and fixed times, and years. \n 4:11 [hgb] 我 为 你 们 害 怕 。 惟 恐 我 在 你 们 身 上 是 枉 费 了 工 夫 。 \n [kjv] I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vain. \n [bbe] I am in fear of you, that I may have been working for you to no purpose. \n 4:12 [hgb] 弟 兄 们 ， 我 劝 你 们 要 象 我 一 样 ， 因 为 我 也 象 你 们 一 样 。 你 们 一 点 没 有 亏 负 我 。 \n [kjv] Brethren, I beseech you, be as I am; for I am as ye are: ye have not injured me at all. \n [bbe] My desire for you, brothers, is that you may be as I am, because I am as you are. You have done me no wrong; \n 4:13 [hgb] 你 们 知 道 我 头 一 次 传 福 音 给 你 们 ， 是 因 为 身 体 有 疾 病 。 \n [kjv] Ye know how through infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you at the first. \n [bbe] But you have knowledge that with a feeble body I was preaching the good news to you the first time; \n 4:14 [hgb] 你 们 为 我 身 体 的 缘 故 受 试 炼 ， 没 有 轻 看 我 ， 也 没 有 厌 弃 我 。 反 倒 接 待 我 ， 如 同 神 的 使 者 ， 如 同 基 督 耶 稣 。 \n [kjv] And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected; but received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus. \n [bbe] And you did not have a poor opinion of me because of the trouble in my flesh, or put shame on it; but you took me to your hearts as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus. \n 4:15 [hgb] 你 们 当 日 所 夸 的 福 气 在 哪 里 呢 ？ 那 时 你 们 若 能 行 ， 就 是 把 自 己 的 眼 睛 剜 出 来 给 我 ， 也 都 情 愿 。 这 是 我 可 以 给 你 们 作 见 证 的 。 \n [kjv] Where is then the blessedness ye spake of? for I bear you record, that, if it had been possible, ye would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me. \n [bbe] Where then is that happy condition of yours? because I give you witness, that, if possible, you would have taken out your eyes and given them to me. \n 4:16 [hgb] 如 今 我 将 真 理 告 诉 你 们 ， 就 成 了 你 们 的 仇 敌 吗 ？ \n [kjv] Am I therefore become your enemy, because I tell you the truth? \n [bbe] So then am I no longer your friend, because I give you true words? \n 4:17 [hgb] 那 些 人 热 心 待 你 们 ， 却 不 是 好 意 ， 是 要 离 间 （ 原 文 作 把 你 们 关 在 外 面 ） 你 们 ， 叫 你 们 热 心 待 他 们 。 \n [kjv] They zealously affect you, but not well; yea, they would exclude you, that ye might affect them. \n [bbe] Their interest in you is not good; but their desire is that you may be shut out, so that you may go after them. \n 4:18 [hgb] 在 善 事 上 ， 常 用 热 心 待 人 ， 原 是 好 的 ， 却 不 单 我 与 你 们 同 在 的 时 候 才 这 样 。 \n [kjv] But it is good to be zealously affected always in a good thing, and not only when I am present with you. \n [bbe] But it is good to have an interest in a good cause at all times, and not only when I am present with you. \n 4:19 [hgb] 我 小 子 阿 ， 我 为 你 们 再 受 生 产 之 苦 ， 直 等 到 基 督 成 形 在 你 们 心 里 。 \n [kjv] My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you, \n [bbe] My children, of whom I am again in birth-pains till Christ is formed in you, \n 4:20 [hgb] 我 巴 不 得 现 今 在 你 们 那 里 ， 改 换 口 气 ， 因 我 为 你 们 ， 心 里 作 难 。 \n [kjv] I desire to be present with you now, and to change my voice; for I stand in doubt of you. \n [bbe] Truly my desire is to be present with you now, using a changed voice; for I am troubled about you. \n 4:21 [hgb] 你 们 这 愿 意 在 律 法 以 下 的 人 ， 请 告 诉 我 ， 你 们 岂 没 有 听 见 律 法 吗 ？ \n [kjv] Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law? \n [bbe] Say, you whose desire it is to be under the law, do you not give ear to the law? \n 4:22 [hgb] 因 为 律 法 上 记 着 ， 亚 伯 拉 罕 有 两 个 儿 子 ， 一 个 是 使 女 生 的 ， 一 个 是 自 主 之 妇 人 生 的 。 \n [kjv] For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a bondmaid, the other by a freewoman. \n [bbe] Because it is in the Writings, that Abraham had two sons, one by the servant-woman, and one by the free woman. \n 4:23 [hgb] 然 而 那 使 女 所 生 的 ， 是 按 着 血 气 生 的 。 那 自 主 之 妇 人 所 生 的 ， 是 凭 着 应 许 生 的 。 \n [kjv] But he who was of the bondwoman was born after the flesh; but he of the freewoman was by promise. \n [bbe] Now the son by the servant-woman has his birth after the flesh; but the son by the free woman has his birth through the undertaking of God. \n 4:24 [hgb] 这 都 是 比 方 。 那 两 个 妇 人 ， 就 是 两 约 。 一 约 是 出 于 西 乃 山 ， 生 子 为 奴 ， 乃 是 夏 甲 。 \n [kjv] Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which gendereth to bondage, which is Agar. \n [bbe] Which things have a secret sense; because these women are the two agreements; one from the mountain of Sinai, giving birth to servants, which is Hagar. \n 4:25 [hgb] 这 夏 甲 二 字 是 指 着 亚 拉 伯 的 西 乃 山 ， 与 现 在 的 耶 路 撒 冷 同 类 。 因 耶 路 撒 冷 和 她 的 儿 女 都 是 为 奴 的 。 \n [kjv] For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answereth to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children. \n [bbe] Now this Hagar is the mountain Sinai in Arabia, and is the image of the Jerusalem which now is: which is a servant with her children. \n 4:26 [hgb] 但 那 在 上 的 耶 路 撒 冷 是 自 主 的 ， 她 是 我 们 的 母 。 \n [kjv] But Jerusalem which is above is free, which is the mother of us all. \n [bbe] But the Jerusalem on high is free, which is our mother. \n 4:27 [hgb] 因 为 经 上 记 着 ， 不 怀 孕 不 生 养 的 ， 你 要 欢 乐 。 未 曾 经 过 产 难 的 ， 你 要 高 声 欢 呼 ， 因 为 没 有 丈 夫 的 ， 比 有 丈 夫 的 儿 女 更 多 。 \n [kjv] For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: for the desolate hath many more children than she which hath an husband. \n [bbe] For it is in the Writings, You who have never given birth, be glad; give cries of joy, you who have had no birth-pains; for the children of her who has been given up by her husband are more than those of the woman who has a husband. \n 4:28 [hgb] 弟 兄 们 ， 我 们 是 凭 着 应 许 作 儿 女 ， 如 同 以 撒 一 样 。 \n [kjv] Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are the children of promise. \n [bbe] Now we, brothers, as Isaac was, are the children of the undertaking of God. \n 4:29 [hgb] 当 时 那 按 着 血 气 生 的 ， 逼 迫 了 那 按 着 圣 灵 生 的 。 现 在 也 是 这 样 。 \n [kjv] But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit, even so it is now. \n [bbe] But as in those days he who had birth after the flesh was cruel to him who had birth after the Spirit, even so it is now. \n 4:30 [hgb] 然 而 经 上 是 怎 么 说 的 呢 ？ 是 说 ， 把 使 女 和 她 儿 子 赶 出 去 ， 因 为 使 女 的 儿 子 ， 不 可 与 自 主 妇 人 的 儿 子 一 同 承 受 产 业 。 \n [kjv] Nevertheless what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondwoman and her son: for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the freewoman. \n [bbe] What then do the Writings say? Send away the servant-woman and her son; for the son of the servant-woman will not have a part in the heritage with the son of the free woman. \n 4:31 [hgb] 弟 兄 们 ， 这 样 看 来 ， 我 们 不 是 使 女 的 儿 女 ， 乃 是 自 主 妇 人 的 儿 女 了 。 \n [kjv] So then, brethren, we are not children of the bondwoman, but of the free. \n [bbe] So, brothers, we are not children of the servant-woman, but of the free woman. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/166/2271.html","bookId":95,"book":{"id":95,"title":"加拉太书 Galatians","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 作 使 徒 的 保 罗 ， （ 不 是 由 于 人 ， 也 不 是 借 着 人 ， 乃 是 借 着 耶 稣 基 督 ， 与 叫 他 从 死 里 复 活 的 父 神 ） [kjv] Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/166","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:15 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:30 AM"}}
