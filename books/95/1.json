Amen. \n [bbe] To whom be the glory for ever and ever. So be it. \n 1:6 [hgb] 我 希 奇 你 们 这 么 快 离 开 那 借 着 基 督 之 恩 召 你 们 的 ， 去 从 别 的 福 音 。 \n [kjv] I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ unto another gospel: \n [bbe] I am surprised that you are being so quickly turned away from him whose word came to you in the grace of Christ, to good news of a different sort; \n 1:7 [hgb] 那 并 不 是 福 音 不 过 有 些 人 搅 扰 你 们 ， 要 把 基 督 的 福 音 更 改 了 。 \n [kjv] Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ. \n [bbe] Which is not another sort: only there are some who give you trouble, desiring to make changes in the good news of Christ. \n 1:8 [hgb] 但 无 论 是 我 们 ， 是 天 上 来 的 使 者 ， 若 传 福 音 给 你 们 ， 与 我 们 所 传 给 你 们 的 不 同 ， 他 就 应 当 被 咒 诅 。 \n [kjv] But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed. \n [bbe] But even if we, or an angel from heaven, were to be a preacher to you of good news other than that which we have given you, let there be a curse on him. \n 1:9 [hgb] 我 们 已 经 说 了 ， 现 在 又 说 ， 若 有 人 传 福 音 给 你 们 ， 与 你 们 所 领 受 的 不 同 ， 他 就 应 当 被 咒 诅 。 \n [kjv] As we said before, so say I now again, If any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed. \n [bbe] As we have said before, so say I now again, If any man is a preacher to you of any good news other than that which has been given to you, let there be a curse on him. \n 1:10 [hgb] 我 现 在 是 要 得 人 的 心 呢 ？ 还 是 要 得 神 的 心 呢 ？ 我 岂 是 讨 人 的 喜 欢 吗 ？ 若 仍 旧 讨 人 的 喜 欢 ， 我 就 不 是 基 督 的 仆 人 了 。 \n [kjv] For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ. \n [bbe] Am I now using arguments to men, or God? or is it my desire to give men pleasure? if I was still pleasing men, I would not be a servant of Christ. \n 1:11 [hgb] 弟 兄 们 ， 我 告 诉 你 们 ， 我 素 来 所 传 的 福 音 ， 不 是 出 于 人 的 意 思 。 \n [kjv] But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man. \n [bbe] Because I say to you, my brothers, that the good news of which I was the preacher is not man\u0027s. \n 1:12 [hgb] 因 为 我 不 是 从 人 领 受 的 ， 也 不 是 人 教 导 我 的 ， 乃 是 从 耶 稣 基 督 启 示 来 的 。 \n [kjv] For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ. \n [bbe] For I did not get it from man, and I was not given teaching in it, but it came to me through revelation of Jesus Christ. \n 1:13 [hgb] 你 们 听 见 我 从 前 在 犹 太 教 中 所 行 的 事 ， 怎 样 极 力 逼 迫 残 害 神 的 教 会 。 \n [kjv] For ye have heard of my conversation in time past in the Jews\u0027 religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and wasted it: \n [bbe] For news has come to you of my way of life in the past in the Jews\u0027 religion, how I was cruel without measure to the church of God, and did great damage to it: \n 1:14 [hgb] 我 又 在 犹 太 教 中 ， 比 我 本 国 许 多 同 岁 的 人 更 有 长 进 ， 为 我 祖 宗 的 遗 传 更 加 热 心 。 \n [kjv] And profited in the Jews\u0027 religion above many my equals in mine own nation, being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers. \n [bbe] And I went farther in the Jews\u0027 religion than a number of my generation among my countrymen, having a more burning interest in the beliefs handed down from my fathers. \n 1:15 [hgb] 然 而 那 把 我 从 母 腹 里 分 别 出 来 ， 又 施 恩 召 我 的 神 ， \n [kjv] But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother\u0027s womb, and called me by his grace, \n [bbe] But when it was the good pleasure of God, by whom I was marked out even from my mother\u0027s body, through his grace, \n 1:16 [hgb] 既 然 乐 意 将 他 儿 子 启 示 在 我 心 里 ， 叫 我 把 他 传 在 外 邦 人 中 ， 我 就 没 有 与 属 血 气 的 人 商 量 ， \n [kjv] To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood: \n [bbe] To give the revelation of his Son in me, so that I might give the news of him to the Gentiles; then I did not take the opinion of flesh and blood, \n 1:17 [hgb] 也 没 有 上 耶 路 撒 冷 去 ， 见 那 些 比 我 先 作 使 徒 的 。 惟 独 往 亚 拉 伯 去 。 后 又 回 到 大 马 色 。 \n [kjv] Neither went I up to Jerusalem to them which were apostles before me; but I went into Arabia, and returned again unto Damascus. \n [bbe] And I went not up to Jerusalem to those who were Apostles before me; but I went away into Arabia, and again I came back to Damascus. \n 1:18 [hgb] 过 了 三 年 ， 才 上 耶 路 撒 冷 去 见 矶 法 ， 和 他 同 住 了 十 五 天 。 \n [kjv] Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter, and abode with him fifteen days. \n [bbe] Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Cephas, and was there with him fifteen days. \n 1:19 [hgb] 至 于 别 的 使 徒 ， 除 了 主 的 兄 弟 雅 各 ， 我 都 没 有 看 见 。 \n [kjv] But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord\u0027s brother. \n [bbe] But of the other Apostles I saw only James, the Lord\u0027s brother. \n 1:20 [hgb] 我 写 给 你 们 的 ， 不 是 谎 话 ， 这 是 我 在 神 面 前 说 的 。 \n [kjv] Now the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not. \n [bbe] Now God is witness that the things which I am writing to you are true. \n 1:21 [hgb] 以 后 我 到 了 叙 利 亚 和 基 利 家 境 内 。 \n [kjv] Afterwards I came into the regions of Syria and Cilicia; \n [bbe] Then I came to the parts of Syria and Cilicia. \n 1:22 [hgb] 那 时 ， 犹 太 信 基 督 的 各 教 会 都 没 有 见 过 我 的 面 。 \n [kjv] And was unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ: \n [bbe] And the churches of Judaea which were in Christ still had no knowledge of my face or person: \n 1:23 [hgb] 不 过 听 说 ， 那 从 前 逼 迫 我 们 的 ， 现 在 传 扬 他 原 先 所 残 害 的 真 道 。 \n [kjv] But they had heard only, That he which persecuted us in times past now preacheth the faith which once he destroyed. \n [bbe] Only it came to their ears that he who at one time was cruel to us is now preaching the faith which before had been attacked by him; \n 1:24 [hgb] 他 们 就 为 我 的 缘 故 ， 归 荣 耀 给 神 。 \n [kjv] And they glorified God in me. \n [bbe] And they gave glory to God in me. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/166/2268.html","bookId":95,"book":{"id":95,"title":"加拉太书 Galatians","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 作 使 徒 的 保 罗 ， （ 不 是 由 于 人 ， 也 不 是 借 着 人 ， 乃 是 借 着 耶 稣 基 督 ， 与 叫 他 从 死 里 复 活 的 父 神 ） [kjv] Paul, an apostle, (not of men, neither by man, but by Jesus Christ, and God the Father...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/166","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:15 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:30 AM"}}
