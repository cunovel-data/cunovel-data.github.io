I hurt you last night.\n On purpose.\n Without even realizing it, because the resentment is eating at me even while I\u0027m convincing myself that I can live with everything you\u0027re not telling me.\"\n Sitting up, he spread his arms.\n \"I\u0027m wide open for you, Eva! You\u0027re making it sound like you don\u0027t know me .\n that all we have is sex .\n when you know me better than anyone else.\"\n \"Let\u0027s talk about what I don\u0027t know.\n Why do you own so much of Vidal Records? Why do you hate your family home? Why are you estranged from your parents? What\u0027s between you and Dr.\n Terrence Lucas? Where\u0027d you go the other night when I had that nightmare? What\u0027s behind your nightmares? Why - \" \"Enough!\" he snapped, shoving his hands through his wet hair.\n I settled back, watching and waiting as he clearly struggled with himself.\n \"You should know you can tell me anything,\" I said softly.\n \"Can I?\" He pierced me with his gaze.\n \"Don\u0027t you have enough to look past as it is? How much shit can I pile on you before you run like hell?\" Laying my arms along the rim of the tub, I leaned my head back and closed my eyes.\n \"Okay, then.\n We\u0027ll just be fuck buddies who bitch to a therapist once a week.\n Good to know.\"\n \"I screwed her,\" he spat.\n \"There.\n Do you feel better?\" I shot up so fast, water surged over the edge of the tub.\n My stomach cramped.\n \"You screwed Corinne?\" \"No, damn it.\"\n His face was flushed.\n \"Lucas\u0027s wife.\"\n \"Oh .\"\n I remembered the photo I\u0027d found of her through my Google search.\n \"She\u0027s a redhead,\" I said lamely.\n \"My attraction to Anne was based entirely on her relationship to Lucas.\"\n I frowned, confused.\n \"So things were off between you and Dr.\n Lucas before you slept with his wife? Or because of it?\" Gideon set his elbow on the side of the tub and scrubbed at his face.\n \"He alienated me from my family.\n I returned the favor.\"\n \"You broke them up?\" \"I broke her.\"\n He exhaled harshly.\n \"She came on to me at a fund-raiser.\n I brushed her off until I learned who she was.\n I knew it\u0027d kill Lucas to know I\u0027d banged her, and the opening was there so I took it.\n It was just supposed to be that once, but Anne contacted me the next day.\n Because it would hurt him more to know she couldn\u0027t get enough, I let it go on.\n When she was ready to leave him for me, I sent her back to her husband.\"\n I stared at him, noting his defiant embarrassment.\n He would do it again, but he was ashamed of what he\u0027d done.\n \"Say something!\" he snapped.\n \"Did she think you loved her?\" \"No.\n Fuck.\n I\u0027m an asshole for nailing another man\u0027s wife, but I didn\u0027t promise her anything.\n I was screwing Lucas through her - I didn\u0027t expect for her to become collateral damage.\n I wouldn\u0027t have let it get that far, if I had.\"\n \"Gideon.\"\n I sighed and shook my head.\n \"What?\" He was practically bristling with restless, anxious energy.\n \"Why did you say my name like that?\" \"Because you\u0027re ridiculously dense for such a smart guy.\n You were sleeping with her regularly and didn\u0027t expect her to fall in love with you?\" \"Jesus.\"\n His head fell back with a groan.\n \"Not this again.\"\n Then he straightened abruptly.\n \"Actually, you know what? You keep on thinking I\u0027m God\u0027s gift to women, angel.\n It\u0027s better for me if you believe I\u0027m the best you can get.\"\n I splashed him.\n The ease with which he dismissed his appeal was another way he mirrored me.\n We knew our strengths and played up our assets.\n But we couldn\u0027t see what made us unique enough for someone to really love us.\n Gideon lunged forward and caught my hands.\n \"Now, tell me what the fuck you had with Brett Kline.\"\n \"You didn\u0027t tell me what Dr.\n Lucas did to piss you off.\"\n \"Yes, I did.\"\n \"Not the details,\" I argued.\n \"It\u0027s your turn to spill.\n Out with it.\"\n It took me a long time to get the words out.\n No guy wanted a recovering slut for his girlfriend.\n But Gideon waited patiently.\n Obstinately.\n I knew he wasn\u0027t going to let me get out of the tub until I told him about Brett.\n \"I was nothing but a convenient fuck for Brett,\" I confessed in a rush, wanting to get it over with, \"and I put up with it - went out of my way for it - because in that period of my life, sex was the only way I knew how to feel loved.\"\n \"He wrote a love song about you, Eva.\"\n I looked away.\n \"The truth wouldn\u0027t make much of a ballad, would it?\" \"Did you love him?\" \"I - No.\"\n I looked at Gideon when he exhaled audibly, as if he\u0027d been holding his breath.\n \"I had a crush on him and the way he sings, but it was totally superficial.\n I never got to really know him.\"\n His entire body visibly relaxed.\n \"He was part of a .\n phase? That\u0027s it?\" I nodded and tried to pull my hands free of his, wishing I could get past my feelings of shame.\n I didn\u0027t blame Brett or any of the guys who\u0027d drifted through my life then.\n I had no one to blame but myself.\n \"Come here.\"\n Gideon caught me by the waist and pulled me closer, tucking me against his chest again.\n His embrace was the most wonderful feeling in the world.\n His hands stroked the length of my spine, gentling me.\n \"I won\u0027t lie.\n I want to beat the hell out of any man who\u0027s had you - you\u0027d be smart to keep them the hell away from me - but nothing in your past can change how I feel about you.\n And God knows I\u0027m no saint.\"\n \"I wish I could make it go away,\" I whispered.\n \"I don\u0027t like remembering the girl I was then.\"\n He rested his chin atop the crown of my head.\n \"I get it.\n It didn\u0027t matter how long I showered after I\u0027d been with Anne, it was never long enough to feel clean.\"\n I tightened my arms around his waist, giving comfort and acceptance.\n And gratefully accepting both in return.\n The white silk robe I found hanging in the closet was gorgeous.\n It was lined with the softest terrycloth and embroidered with silver thread at the cuffs.\n I loved it, which was a good thing since it was, apparently, the only article of clothing for me in the entire house.\n I watched Gideon pull on a pair of black silk pajama pants and tie the drawstring.\n \"Why do you get clothes and I get a robe?\" He glanced up at me through a lock of inky hair that draped over his brow.\n \"Because I\u0027m the one who arranged everything?\" \"Fiend.\"\n \"Just makes it easier for me to keep up with your insatiable sexual demands.\"\n \"My insatiable demands?\" I headed into the bathroom to take the towel off my head.\n \"I clearly remember begging to be left alone last night. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reflected-in-you-crossfire-2/page-32.html","bookId":1923,"book":{"id":1923,"title":"Reflected in You (Crossfire #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Reflected in You (Crossfire #2) \n Gideon Cross.
