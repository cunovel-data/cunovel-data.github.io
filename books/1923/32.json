I hurt you last night.\\n\\n On purpose.\\n\\n Without even realizing it, because the resentment is eating at me even while I\u0027m convincing myself that I can live with everything you\u0027re not telling me.\"\\n\\n Sitting up, he spread his arms.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m wide open for you, Eva!

Why do you hate your family home? Why are you estranged from your parents? What\u0027s between you and Dr.\\n\\n Terrence Lucas? Where\u0027d you go the other night when I had that nightmare? What\u0027s behind your nightmares? Why - \" \"Enough!\" he snapped, shoving his hands through his wet hair.\\n\\n I settled back, watching and waiting as he clearly struggled with himself.\\n\\n \"You should know you can tell me anything,\" I said softly.\\n\\n \"Can I?\" He pierced me with his gaze.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t you have enough to look past as it is? How much shit can I pile on you before you run like hell?\" Laying my arms along the rim of the tub, I leaned my head back and closed my eyes.\\n\\n \"Okay, then.\\n\\n We\u0027ll just be fuck buddies who bitch to a therapist once a week.\\n\\n Good to know.\"\\n\\n \"I screwed her,\" he spat.\\n\\n \"There.\\n\\n Do you feel better?\" I shot up so fast, water surged over the edge of the tub.\\n\\n My stomach cramped.\\n\\n \"You screwed Corinne?\" \"No, damn it.\"\\n\\n His face was flushed.\\n\\n \"Lucas\u0027s wife.\"\\n\\n \"Oh .\"\\n\\n I remembered the photo I\u0027d found of her through my Google search.\\n\\n \"She\u0027s a redhead,\" I said lamely.\\n\\n \"My attraction to Anne was based entirely on her relationship to Lucas.\"\\n\\n I frowned, confused.\\n\\n \"So things were off between you and Dr.\\n\\n Lucas before you slept with his wife? Or because of it?\" Gideon set his elbow on the side of the tub and scrubbed at his face.\\n\\n \"He alienated me from my family.\\n\\n I returned the favor.\"\\n\\n \"You broke them up?\" \"I broke her.\"\\n\\n He exhaled harshly.\\n\\n \"She came on to me at a fund-raiser.\\n\\n I brushed her off until I learned who she was.\\n\\n I knew it\u0027d kill Lucas to know I\u0027d banged her, and the opening was there so I took it.\\n\\n It was just supposed to be that once, but Anne contacted me the next day.\\n\\n Because it would hurt him more to know she couldn\u0027t get enough, I let it go on.\\n\\n When she was ready to leave him for me, I sent her back to her husband.\"\\n\\n I stared at him, noting his defiant embarrassment.\\n\\n He would do it again, but he was ashamed of what he\u0027d done.\\n\\n \"Say something!\" he snapped.\\n\\n \"Did she think you loved her?\" \"No.\\n\\n Fuck.\\n\\n I\u0027m an asshole for nailing another man\u0027s wife, but I didn\u0027t promise her anything.\\n\\n I was screwing Lucas through her - I didn\u0027t expect for her to become collateral damage.\\n\\n I wouldn\u0027t have let it get that far, if I had.\"\\n\\n \"Gideon.\"\\n\\n I sighed and shook my head.\\n\\n \"What?\" He was practically bristling with restless, anxious energy.\\n\\n \"Why did you say my name like that?\" \"Because you\u0027re ridiculously dense for such a smart guy.\\n\\n You were sleeping with her regularly and didn\u0027t expect her to fall in love with you?\" \"Jesus.\"\\n\\n His head fell back with a groan.\\n\\n \"Not this again.\"\\n\\n Then he straightened abruptly.\\n\\n \"Actually, you know what?
