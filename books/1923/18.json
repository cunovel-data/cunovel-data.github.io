{"id":63470,"no":18,"title":"Page 18","content":"As he\u0027d told me once, he had been the recipient of many I love yous over the years, but he\u0027d never believed them because they hadn\u0027t been backed up with truth, trust, and honesty. The words meant little to him, which was why he refused to say them to me. I tried not to let him see how it hurt me that he wouldn\u0027t say them. I figured that was an adjustment I\u0027d have to make to be with him. \"Good morning, Eva.\" I glanced up from my desk and found Mark standing by my cubicle. His slightly crooked smile was always a winner. \"Hey. I\u0027m ready to roll when you are.\" \"Coffee first. You up for a refill?\" Grabbing my empty mug off my desk, I stood. \"You bet.\" We headed toward the break room. \"You look like you got a tan,\" Mark said, glancing over at me. \"Yeah, I did a little sun lounging over the weekend. It was good to be lazy and do nothing. Actually, that\u0027s probably one of my favorite things to do, period.\" \"I\u0027m envious. Steven can\u0027t sit still for too long. He always wants to drag me somewhere for something.\" \"My roommate\u0027s the same way. It\u0027s exhausting how he runs around.\" \"Oh, before I forget.\" He gestured for me to enter the break room first. \"Shawna wants you to get in touch. She\u0027s got concert tickets for some new rock band. I think she wants to see if you\u0027d want them.\" I thought of the attractive red- haired waitress I\u0027d met the week before. She was Steven\u0027s sister, and Steven was Mark\u0027s longtime partner. The two men had met in college and had been together ever since. I really liked Steven. I was pretty sure I\u0027d really like Shawna, too. \"Are you okay with me reaching out to her?\" I had to ask, because she was - for all intents and purposes - Mark\u0027s sister-in-law and Mark was my boss.\"Of course. Don\u0027t worry. It won\u0027t be weird.\" \"All right.\" I smiled and hoped to add another girlfriend to my new life in New York. \"Thanks.\" \"Thank me with a cup of coffee,\" he said, pulling out a mug from the cupboard and handing it to me. \"You make it taste better than I do.\" I shot him a look. \"My dad uses that line.\" \"Must be true, then.\" \"Must be a standard guy finagle,\" I shot back. \"How do you and Steven divvy up coffee making?\" \"We don\u0027t.\" He grinned. \"There\u0027s a Starbucks on the corner by our place.\" \"I\u0027m sure there\u0027s a way to call that cheating, but I haven\u0027t had enough caffeine to think of it yet.\" I passed over his filled mug to him. \"Which probably means I shouldn\u0027t share the idea that just came to me.\" \"Go for it. If it really sucks, I can hold it against you forever.\" \"Gee. Thanks.\" I held my mug between both hands. \"Would it work to market the blueberry coffee like tea instead? You know, the coffee in a chintz teacup and saucer with maybe a scone and some clotted cream in the background? Give it a high-end, midafternoon snack sort of treatment? Throw in a fabulously handsome Englishman to sip it with?\" Mark\u0027s lips pursed as he thought about it. \"I think I like it. Let\u0027s go run it by the creatives.\" \"Why didn\u0027t you tell me you were going to Las Vegas?\" I sighed inwardly at the high note of irritated anxiety in my mother\u0027s voice and adjusted my grip on my desk phone receiver. I\u0027d barely returned my butt to my chair when the phone had rung. I suspected if I checked my voice mail, I\u0027d find a message or two from her. When she got worked up about something, she couldn\u0027t let it go. \"Hi, Mom. I\u0027m sorry. I planned on calling you at lunch and catching up.\" \"I love Vegas.\" \"You do?\" I thought she hated anything remotely related to gambling. \"I didn\u0027t know that.\" \"You would\u0027ve if you\u0027d asked.\" There was a hurt note in my mother\u0027s breathy voice that made me wince. \"I\u0027m sorry, Mom,\" I said again, having learned as a child that repeated apologies went a long way with her. \"I needed to spend some downtime with Cary. We can talk about a future trip to Vegas, though, if you\u0027d like to go sometime.\" \"Wouldn\u0027t that be fun? I\u0027d like to do fun things with you, Eva.\" \"I\u0027d like that, too.\" My eyes went to the picture of my mother and Stanton. She was a beautiful woman, one who radiated a vulnerable sensuality to which men responded helplessly. The vulnerability was real - my mom was fragile in many ways - but she was a man-eater, too. Men didn\u0027t take advantage of my mom; she walked all over them. \"Do you have plans for lunch? I could make a reservation and come get you.\" \"Can I bring a co-worker?\" Megumi had hit me up with a lunch invitation when I\u0027d come in, promising to regale me with the tale of her blind date.\"Oh, I\u0027d love to meet the people you work with!\" My mouth curved with genuine affection. My mom drove me nuts a lot, but at the end of the day, her biggest fault was that she loved me too much. Combined with her neurosis, it was a maddening flaw, but one motivated by the best of intentions. \"Okay. Pick us up at noon. And remember, we only get an hour, so it\u0027ll have to be close by and quick.\" \"I\u0027ll take care of it. I\u0027m excited! See you soon.\" Megumi and my mother took to each other right away. I recognized the familiar starry-eyed look on Megumi\u0027s face when they met, because I\u0027d seen it so often over the years. Monica Stanton was a stunning woman, the kind of classic beauty you couldn\u0027t help but stare at because you couldn\u0027t believe anyone could be that perfect. Plus, the royal purple hue of the wingback she\u0027d elected to sit in was an amazing backdrop for her golden hair and blue eyes.For her part, my mom was delighted by Megumi\u0027s fashion sense. While my wardrobe choices leaned more toward traditional and ready-to- wear, Megumi favored unique combinations and color, much like the decor of the trendy cafe near Rockefeller Center my mom had taken us to. The place reminded me of Alice in Wonderland, with its gilt and jewel- toned velvets used on uniquely shaped furniture. The chaise Megumi was perched on had an exaggerated curved back, while my mother\u0027s wingback had gargoyles for feet. \"I\u0027m still trying to figure out what\u0027s wrong with him,\" Megumi went on. \"I was looking, let me tell you. I mean a guy that great shouldn\u0027t be slumming it with blind dates.\" \"Hardly slumming it,\" my mom protested. \"I\u0027m sure he\u0027s wondering how he lucked out with you.\" \"Thanks!\" Megumi grinned at me. \"He was seriously hot. Not Gideon Cross hot, but hot all the same.\" \"How is Gideon, by the way?\" I didn\u0027t take my mom\u0027s question lightly. She was aware that Gideon knew about the abuse I\u0027d suffered as a child, and she\u0027d taken the news hard. It was her greatest shame that she hadn\u0027t known what was going on under her own roof, and her guilt was enormous, as well as entirely undeserved. She hadn\u0027t known because I\u0027d hidden it. Nathan had made me fear what he\u0027d do if I ever told anyone. Still, my mother was anxious about Gideon\u0027s knowing. I hoped that she\u0027d soon come to realize that Gideon didn\u0027t hold it against her any more than I did. \"He\u0027s working hard,\" I answered. \"You know how it is. I\u0027ve taken up a lot of his time since we hooked up, and I think he\u0027s paying for it now.\" \"You\u0027re worth it.\" I took a large gulp of my water when I felt the nearly overwhelming urge to tell her that my dad was coming to visit. She\u0027d be an ally in convincing him of Gideon\u0027s affection for me, but that was a selfish reason to say anything. I had no idea how she would react to Victor\u0027s being in New York, but it was highly possible she\u0027d be distressed, and that would make everyone\u0027s life hell. Whatever her reasons, she preferred to have no contact with him whatsoever. I couldn\u0027t ignore how she\u0027d managed to avoid seeing or talking to him since I\u0027d become old enough to communicate with him directly. \"I saw a picture of Cary on the side of a bus yesterday,\" she said. \"Really?\" I sat up straighter. \"Where?\" \"On Broadway. A jeans ad, I think it was.\" \"I saw one, too,\" Megumi said. \"Not that I paid any attention to what he was wearing. That man is fine.\" The conversation made me smile. My mother was adept at admiring men. It was one of the many reasons they adored her - she made them feel good. Megumi was more than her match in the guy-appreciation department. \"He\u0027s been getting recognized on the street,\" I said, glad that in this case we were talking about an ad and not a tabloid candid with me. The gossips thought it was so juicy that Gideon Cross\u0027s girlfriend lived with a sexy male model. \"Of course,\" my mom said, with a slight note of chastisement. \"You didn\u0027t doubt he would eventually?\" \"I\u0027d hoped,\" I qualified. \"For his sake. It\u0027s a sad fact that male models don\u0027t make as much or work as often as the women do.\" Although I\u0027d expected Cary would break through somehow. Emotionally, he couldn\u0027t afford not to. He\u0027d learned to put so much value on his looks that I didn\u0027t think he could allow himself to fail.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reflected-in-you-crossfire-2/page-18.html","bookId":1923,"book":{"id":1923,"title":"Reflected in You (Crossfire #2)","description":"Storyline: Reflected in You (Crossfire #2) Gideon Cross.
