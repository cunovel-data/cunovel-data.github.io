NYPD detectives Graves and Michna are here,\" the gal at the front desk said.\n I glanced at Cary, wondering if the detectives had found out who\u0027d attacked him.\n I gave the go-ahead for them to come up and hurried back to the dining table.\n Cary looked at me with raised brows, curious.\n \"It\u0027s the detectives,\" I explained.\n \"Maybe they have news.\"\n My dad\u0027s focus immediately shifted.\n Honed.\n \"I\u0027ll let them in.\"\n Ireland helped me clear up.\n We\u0027d just dumped the cups into the sink when the doorbell rang.\n I wiped my hands with a dish towel and went out to the living room.\n The two detectives who entered weren\u0027t the ones I expected, because they weren\u0027t the ones who\u0027d questioned Cary at the hospital on Monday.\n Gideon appeared out of the hallway, shoving his phone into his pocket.\n I wondered who\u0027d been calling him all night.\n \"Eva Tramell,\" the female detective said, stepping deeper into my apartment.\n She was a thin woman with a severe face and sharply intelligent blue eyes, which were her best feature.\n Her hair was brown and curly, her face clean of makeup.\n She wore slacks over dark flats, a poplin shirt, and a lightweight jacket that didn\u0027t hide the badge and gun clipped to her belt.\n \"I\u0027m Detective Shelley Graves of the NYPD.\n This is my partner Detective Richard Michna.\n We\u0027re sorry to disturb you on a Friday night.\"\n Michna was older, taller, and portly.\n His hair was graying at the temples and receding at the top, but he had a strong face and dark eyes that raked the room while Graves focused on me.\n \"Hello,\" I greeted them.\n My father shut the door, and something about the way he moved or carried himself caught Michna\u0027s attention.\n \"You on the job?\" \"In California,\" my dad confirmed.\n \"I\u0027m visiting Eva, my daughter.\n What\u0027s this about?\" \"We\u0027d just like to ask you a few questions, Miss Tramell,\" Graves said.\n She looked at Gideon.\n \"And you, too, Mr.\n Cross.\"\n \"Does this have something to do with the attack on Cary?\" I asked.\n She glanced at him.\n \"Why don\u0027t we sit down.\"\n We all moved into the living room, but only Ireland and I ended up taking a seat.\n Everyone else remained on their feet, with my dad pushing Cary\u0027s wheelchair.\n \"Nice place you\u0027ve got here,\" Michna said.\n \"Thank you.\"\n I looked at Cary, wondering what the hell was going on.\n \"How long are you in town?\" the detective asked my dad.\n \"Just for the weekend.\"\n Graves smiled at me.\n \"You go out to California a lot to see your dad?\" \"I just moved from there a couple months ago.\"\n \"I went to Disneyland once when I was a kid,\" she said.\n \"That was a while ago, obviously.\n I\u0027ve been meaning to get back out there.\"\n I frowned, not understanding why we were making small talk.\n \"We just need to ask you a couple of questions,\" Michna said, pulling a notepad out of the interior pocket of his jacket.\n \"We don\u0027t want to hold you up any longer than we have to.\"\n Graves nodded, her eyes still on me.\n \"Can you tell us if you\u0027re familiar with a man named Nathan Barker, Miss Tramell?\" The room spun.\n Cary cursed and pushed unsteadily to his feet, taking the few steps to reach the seat beside me.\n He caught up my hand.\n \"Miss Tramell?\" Graves took a seat on the other end of the sectional.\n \"He\u0027s her former stepbrother,\" Cary snapped.\n \"What\u0027s this about?\" \"When\u0027s the last time you saw Barker?\" Michna asked.\n In a courtroom .\n I tried to swallow, but my mouth was dry as sawdust.\n \"Eight years ago,\" I said hoarsely.\n \"Did you know he was here in New York?\" Oh God.\n I shook my head violently.\n \"Where\u0027s this going?\" my dad asked.\n I looked helplessly at Cary, then at Gideon.\n My dad didn\u0027t know about Nathan.\n I didn\u0027t want him to know.\n Cary squeezed my hand.\n Gideon wouldn\u0027t even look at me.\n \"Mr.\n Cross,\" Graves said.\n \"What about you?\" \"What about me?\" \"Do you know Nathan Barker?\" My eyes pleaded with Gideon not to say anything in front of my dad, but he never once glanced my way.\n \"You wouldn\u0027t be asking that question,\" he answered, \"if you didn\u0027t already know the answer.\"\n My stomach dropped.\n A violent shiver moved through me.\n Still, Gideon wouldn\u0027t look at me.\n My brain was trying to process what was happening .\n what it meant .\n what was going on .\n \"Is there a point to these questions?\" my father asked.\n The blood was roaring in my ears.\n My heart was pounding with something like terror.\n The mere thought of Nathan being so close was enough to send me into a panic.\n I was panting.\n The room was swimming before my eyes.\n I thought I might pass out.\n Graves was watching me like a hawk.\n \"Can you just tell us where you were yesterday, Miss Tramell?\" \"Where I was?\" I repeated.\n \"Yesterday?\" \"Don\u0027t answer that,\" my dad ordered.\n \"This interview isn\u0027t going any further until we know what this is about.\"\n Michna nodded, as if he\u0027d expected the interruption.\n \"Nathan Barker was found dead this morning.\"\n Chapter 16\n As soon as Detective Michna finished his sentence, my dad cut the questioning off.\n \"We\u0027re done here,\" he said grimly.\n \"If you have any further questions, you can make an appointment for my daughter to come in with counsel.\"\n \"How about you, Mr.\n Cross?\" Michna\u0027s gaze moved to Gideon.\n \"Would you mind telling us where you were yesterday?\" Gideon moved from his position behind the couch.\n \"Why don\u0027t we talk while I show you out?\" I stared at him, but he still wouldn\u0027t look at me.\n What else didn\u0027t he want me to know? How much was he hiding from me?Ireland\u0027s fingers threaded with mine.\n Cary sat on one side of me and Ireland on the other, while the man I loved stood several feet away and hadn\u0027t glanced at me in almost half an hour.\n I felt like a cold rock had settled in my gut.\n The detectives took down my phone numbers, then left with Gideon.\n I watched the three of them walk out, saw my dad eyeing Gideon with a hard speculative look.\n \"Maybe he was buying you an engagement ring,\" Ireland whispered.\n \"And he doesn\u0027t want to blow the surprise.\"\n I squeezed her hand for being sweet and thinking so highly of her brother.\n I hoped he never let her down or disillusioned her.\n The way I was now disillusioned.\n Gideon and I were nothing - we had nothing together - if he couldn\u0027t be honest with me.\n Why hadn\u0027t he told me about Nathan? Releasing Cary and Ireland, I stood and went into the kitchen.\n My dad followed me.\n \"Want to fill me in with what\u0027s going on?\" he asked.\n \"I have no idea.\n This is all news to me.\"\n He leaned his hip into the counter and studied me.\n \"What\u0027s the history with you and Nathan Barker? You heard his name and looked like you were going to pass out.\"\n I started rinsing off the dishes and loading the dishwasher.\n \"He was a bully, Dad.\n That\u0027s all.\n He didn\u0027t like that his dad remarried, and he especially didn\u0027t like that his new stepmom already had a kid.\"\n \"Why would Gideon have anything to do with him?\" \"That\u0027s a really good question.\"\n As I gripped the edge of the sink, I bowed my head and closed my eyes.\n That was what had driven the wedge between me and Gideon - Nathan.\n I knew it.\n \"Eva?\" My dad\u0027s hands settled on my shoulders and kneaded into the hard, aching muscles.\n \"Are you okay?\" \"I-I\u0027m tired.\n I haven\u0027t been sleeping well.\"\n I shut off the water and left the rest of the dishes where they were.\n I went to the cupboard where we kept our vitamins and over-the-counter medicines and took out two nighttime painkillers.\n I wanted a deep, dreamless sleep.\n I needed it, so I could wake up in a condition to figure out what I needed to do.\n I looked at my dad.\n \"Can you take care of Ireland until Gideon gets back?\" \"Of course.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reflected-in-you-crossfire-2/page-46.html","bookId":1923,"book":{"id":1923,"title":"Reflected in You (Crossfire #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Reflected in You (Crossfire #2) \n Gideon Cross.
