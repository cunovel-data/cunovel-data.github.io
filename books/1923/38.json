With both of you, I mean.\"\\n\\n He looked at me with haunted eyes for a long minute; then his shoulders slumped.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know.\\n\\n I think I have to decide if I can live with him cheating.\\n\\n Could you do it, Eva? Could you sit at home waiting for your man, knowing he was sticking it somewhere else?\" \"No.\"\\n\\n An icy shiver coursed through me at the mere words.\\n\\n \"No, I couldn\u0027t.\"\\n\\n \"And I don\u0027t even know if Cary would agree to counseling.\\n\\n He keeps pushing me away.\\n\\n He wants me, and then he doesn\u0027t.\\n\\n He\u0027s committed, and then he isn\u0027t.\\n\\n I want in, Eva, like he\u0027s let you in, but he keeps shutting me out.\"\\n\\n \"It took me a long time to break through to him.\\n\\n He tried pushing me away with sex, always coming on to me, taunting me.\\n\\n I think you made the right decision keeping it platonic on Friday.\\n\\n Cary puts his value on his looks and sex appeal.\\n\\n You need to show him that it\u0027s not just his body you want.\"\\n\\n Trey sighed and crossed his arms.\\n\\n \"Is that how you two got close? Because you wouldn\u0027t sleep with him?\" \"Partly.\\n\\n Mostly it\u0027s because I\u0027m a mess.\\n\\n It\u0027s not as obvious now as it was when we met, but he knows I\u0027m not perfect.\"\\n\\n \"Neither am I! Who is?\" \"He believes you\u0027re better than he is, that you deserve better.\"\\n\\n I grinned.\\n\\n \"Me .\\n\\n well, I bet part of him thinks I deserve him.\\n\\n That we deserve each other.\"\\n\\n \"Crazy fucker,\" he muttered.\\n\\n \"He is that,\" I agreed.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s why we love him, isn\u0027t it? Do you want to go in and see him? Or do you want to go home and think about it?\" \"No, I want to see him.\"\\n\\n Trey\u0027s shoulders rolled back and his chin lifted.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t care what put him here.\\n\\n I want to be with him while he\u0027s going through this.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m glad to hear that.\"\\n\\n I linked my arm with his and led him to Cary\u0027s room.\\n\\n We entered to the sound of my mother\u0027s trilling, girlish laughter.\\n\\n She sat on the edge of the bed, with Cary smiling adoringly at her.\\n\\n She was as much a mother to him as she was to me, and he loved her so much for that.\\n\\n His own mother had hated him, abused him, and allowed others to abuse him.\\n\\n He looked over and saw us, and the emotions that swept across his face in that moment caused a tightness in my chest.\\n\\n I heard Trey\u0027s breath catch as he got his first sight of Cary\u0027s condition.\\n\\n I kicked myself for not telling him in advance not to make the mistake of getting weepy like I had.\\n\\n Trey cleared his throat.\\n\\n \"Drama queen,\" he said with gruff affection.\\n\\n \"If you wanted flowers, you should\u0027ve just asked for them.\\n\\n This is extreme.\"\\n\\n \"And ineffective, apparently,\" Cary rejoined hoarsely, clearly trying to pull himself together.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t see any flowers.\"\\n\\n \"I see a ton.\"\\n\\n Trey\u0027s gaze did a brief slide across the room, then went back to Cary.\\n\\n \"Just wanted to see what I was up against, so I could beat out my competition.\"\\n\\n There was no way to miss the double meaning in that statement.\\n\\n My mom rose from the bed.\\n\\n She leaned over and kissed Cary\u0027s cheek.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll take Eva out to breakfast.\\n\\n We\u0027ll see you in about an hour or so.\"\\n\\n \"Gimme a sec,\" I said, passing the bed quickly, \"and I\u0027ll get out of your hair, guys.\"\\n\\n I grabbed my phone and charger out of my bag and plugged it into an outlet by the window.\\n\\n As soon as the screen flickered to life, I sent a quick group text message to Shawna and my dad, saying simply: I\u0027ll call later.\\n\\n Then I made sure my phone was silenced and left it on the window ledge.\\n\\n \"Ready?\" my mom asked.\\n\\n \"As I\u0027ll ever be.\"\\n\\n Chapter 13\\n\\n I had to get up before dawn Tuesday morning.\\n\\n I left a note for Cary where he\u0027d see it as soon as he woke up, then headed out to grab a cab back to our place.\\n\\n I showered, dressed, made coffee, and tried to talk myself out of feeling like something was off.\\n\\n I was stressed and suffering from lack of sleep, which always led to tiny bouts of depression.\\n\\n I told myself that it had nothing to do with Gideon, but the knot in my stomach said differently.\\n\\n Looking at the clock, I saw it was a little after eight.\\n\\n I\u0027d have to leave soon, because Gideon hadn\u0027t called or texted to say that he\u0027d be giving me a ride.\\n\\n It had been almost twenty-four hours since I\u0027d last seen him or even really talked to him.\\n\\n The call I\u0027d made to him at nine the night before had been less than brief.\\n\\n He\u0027d been in the middle of something and barely said hello and good-bye.\\n\\n I knew he had a lot of work to do.\\n\\n I knew I shouldn\u0027t resent him for having to pay for the time away with extra hours of work getting caught up.\\n\\n He\u0027d done a lot to help me deal with Cary\u0027s situation, more than anyone could\u0027ve expected.\\n\\n It was up to me to deal with how I was feeling about it.\\n\\n Finishing my coffee, I rinsed out my mug, then grabbed my purse and bag on the way out.\\n\\n My tree-lined street was quiet, but the rest of New York was wide awake, its ceaseless energy thrumming with a tangible force.\\n\\n Women in chic office wear and men in suits tried to hail taxis that streaked by, before settling for packed buses or the subway instead.\\n\\n Flower stands exploded with brilliant color, the sight of them always capable of cheering me up in the morning, as did the sight and smell of the neighborhood bakery, which was doing a brisk business at that hour.\\n\\n I was a little ways down Broadway before my phone rang.\\n\\n The little thrill that shot through me at the sight of Gideon\u0027s name quickened my steps.\\n\\n \"Hey, stranger.\"\\n\\n \"Where the hell are you?\" he snapped.\\n\\n A frisson of unease dampened my excitement.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m on my way to work.\"\\n\\n \"Why?\" He spoke to someone offline, then, \"Are you in a cab?\" \"I\u0027m walking.\\n\\n Jeez.\\n\\n Did you wake up on the wrong side of the bed or what?\" \"You should have waited to be picked up.\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t hear from you, and I didn\u0027t want to be late after missing work yesterday.\"\\n\\n \"You could\u0027ve called me instead of just taking off.\"\\n\\n His voice was low and angry.\\n\\n I became angry, too.\\n\\n \"The last time I called, you were too busy to give me more than a minute of your time.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve got things to take care of, Eva.\\n\\n Give me a break.\"\\n\\n \"Sure thing.\\n\\n How about now?\" I hung up and dropped my phone back into my bag.\\n\\n It began ringing again immediately and I ignored it, my blood simmering.\\n\\n When the Bentley pulled up beside me a few minutes later, I kept walking.\\n\\n It followed, the front passenger window sliding down.\\n\\n Angus leaned over.\\n\\n \"Miss Tramell, please.\"\\n\\n I paused, looking at him.\\n\\n \"Are you alone?\" \"Yes.\"\\n\\n With a sigh, I got in the car.\\n\\n My phone was still ringing nonstop, so I reached in and shut the ringer off.\\n\\n One block later, I heard Gideon\u0027s voice coming through the car\u0027s speakers.\\n\\n \"Do you have her?\" \"Yes, sir,\" Angus replied.\\n\\n The line cut out.\\n\\n \"What the hell crawled up his ass and died?\" I asked, looking at Angus in the rearview mirror.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s got a lot on his mind.\"\\n\\n Whatever it was, it sure wasn\u0027t me.\\n\\n I couldn\u0027t believe what a jerk he was being.\\n\\n He\u0027d been curt on the phone the night before, too, but not rude.\\n\\n Within a few minutes after I arrived at work, Mark came up to my cubicle.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry to hear about your roommate,\" he said, setting a fresh cup of coffee on my desk.\\n\\n \"Is he going to be all right?\" \"Eventually.\\n\\n Cary\u0027s tough; he\u0027ll pull through.\"
