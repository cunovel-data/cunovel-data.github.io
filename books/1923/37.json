There are girls who can date rock stars; you\u0027re not one of them. All that time on the road, all those groupies . You\u0027d drive yourself and him insane.\" I shot him a look. \"I\u0027m in total agreement with you. But I\u0027m insulted that you\u0027d think I\u0027d run back to him just because he made it big.\" \"That\u0027s not why. I didn\u0027t want you to hear their first single if it could be helped.\" \"\u0027Golden\u0027?\" \"Yeah .\" He studied me as I headed toward the bathroom. \"What\u0027d you think of it?\" \"It\u0027s better than a song titled \u0027Tapped That.\u0027\" \"Ha!\" He waited until I came out again with my face washed and hair brushed. \"So . you kissed him.\" \"That\u0027s the beginning and end of that story,\" I said dryly. \"Have you talked to Trey since Friday?\" \"No. They\u0027ve got my phone somewhere. My wallet, too, I\u0027m guessing. When I came to, I was here, wearing this\" - he pinched at his hospital gown - \"freakin\u0027 thing.\" \"I\u0027ll get your stuff for you.\" I dumped my toiletries back in the bag, then went to sit in the chair beside him with my coffee in hand. \"Gideon\u0027s making arrangements to get you home with a private nurse.\" \"Ooh . that\u0027s a fantasy of mine. Can you make sure the nurse is hot? And single?\" My brows rose. Inside, though, I was so relieved to see him looking and sounding more like himself. \"You\u0027re obviously feeling better, if you\u0027re feeling frisky. How did things go with Trey?\" \"Good.\" He sighed. \"I\u0027d worried that the party wouldn\u0027t be his scene. I forgot that he knew a lot of the people already.\" Cary and Trey had met at a photo shoot, with Cary modeling and Trey assisting the photographer behind the camera. \"I\u0027m glad you had a good time.\" \"Yeah. He was totally set on not getting laid.\" \"So you tried . after you said you wouldn\u0027t.\" \"This is me we\u0027re talking about.\" He rolled his eyes. \"Hell yeah, I tried. He\u0027s hot and great in bed - \" \" - and in love with you.\" He released his pent-up breath in a rush, wincing as his chest expanded. \"No one\u0027s perfect.\" I had to bite back a laugh. \"Cary Taylor. Loving you isn\u0027t a character defect.\" \"Well, it\u0027s not very smart. I was such an asshole to him,\" he muttered, looking disgruntled. \"He could do so much better.\" \"That isn\u0027t your decision to make for him.\" \"Someone needs to make it.\" \"And you\u0027re volunteering because you love him, too.\" My mouth curved. \"Don\u0027t you think that sounds ass- backwards?\" \"I don\u0027t love him enough.\" All traces of levity were wiped from his face, leaving behind the wounded and lonely man I knew all too well. \"I can\u0027t be faithful like he wants. Just him and me. I like women. Love them, actually. I\u0027d be cutting off half of who I am. Just thinking about it makes me resent him.\" \"You fought too hard to accept yourself,\" I said softly, remembering that time with more than a little twinge of sadness. \"I totally understand and don\u0027t disagree, but have you tried talking to Trey about it?\" \"Yes, I talked to him about it. He listened.\" He rubbed his fingers over his brow. \"I get it, I do. If he told me he wanted to bang some other guy while seeing me, it\u0027d bother the fuck out of me.\" \"But not if it were a woman?\" \"No. I don\u0027t know. Shit.\" His bloodshot green eyes pleaded with me. \"Would it make a difference to you if Cross were banging another man? Or just another woman?\" The door opened and Gideon walked in. I held his gaze when I said, \"If Gideon\u0027s dick touched anything but his hand or me, we\u0027d be over.\" His brows rose. \"Well, then.\" I smiled sweetly and winked. \"Hi, ace.\" \"Angel.\" He looked at Cary. \"How are you feeling this morning?\" Cary\u0027s lips twisted wryly. \"Like I got hit by a bus . or a bat.\" \"We\u0027re working on getting you set up at home. It looks like we can make that happen by Wednesday.\" \"Big tits, please,\" Cary said. \"Or bulging muscles. Either will do.\" Gideon looked at me. I grinned. \"The private nurse.\" \"Ah.\" \"If it\u0027s a woman,\" Cary went on, \"can you get her to wear one of those white nurse dresses with the zipper down the front.\" \"I can only imagine the media frenzy over that sexual-harassment lawsuit,\" Gideon said dryly. \"How about a collection of naughty-nurse porn instead?\" \"Dude.\" Cary smiled wide and looked, for a moment, like his old self. \"You\u0027re the man.\" Gideon looked at me. \"Eva.\" I stood and bent over to kiss Cary on the cheek. \"I\u0027ll be right back.\" We stepped out of the room and I saw my mother in conversation with the doctor, who looked dazzled by her. \"I talked to Garrity this morning,\" Gideon said, referring to Mark, my boss. \"So don\u0027t worry about that.\" I hadn\u0027t been, because he said he\u0027d handle it. \"Thank you. I\u0027ll need to go in tomorrow. I\u0027m going to see if I can get hold of Trey, Cary\u0027s boyfriend. Maybe he can stop in while I\u0027m at work.\" \"Let me know if you need any help with that.\" Gideon glanced at his watch. \"You\u0027ll want to stay here again tonight?\" \"Yes, if that\u0027s possible. Until Cary comes home.\" He took my face in his hands and pressed his lips to mine. \"All right. I have a lot of work to catch up on. Charge your cell so I can reach you.\" I heard a faint buzzing. Gideon backed away and reached into an inner jacket pocket to withdraw his phone. He read the screen, then said, \"I have to get this. I\u0027ll talk to you later.\" Then he was gone, striding down the hallway as quickly as he\u0027d arrived. \"He\u0027s going to marry you,\" my mother said, coming up to stand beside me. \"You know that, don\u0027t you?\" I didn\u0027t, no. I still felt a little flare of gratitude every morning when I woke up and realized that we were still together. \"What makes you say that?\" My mother looked at me with her baby blue eyes. It was one of the rare physical traits we didn\u0027t share. \"He\u0027s completely taken you over and assumed control of everything.\" \"That\u0027s just his nature.\" \"That\u0027s the nature of all powerful men,\" she said, reaching up to fuss with my no-nonsense ponytail. \"And he\u0027ll indulge you, because he\u0027s making an investment in you. You\u0027re an asset to him. You\u0027re beautiful, well bred and well connected, and independently wealthy. You\u0027re also in love with him and he can\u0027t take his eyes off you. I bet he can\u0027t keep his hands off you, either.\" \"Mother, please.\" I was so not in the mood for one of her lectures on the fine points of catching and marrying a rich man. \"Eva Lauren,\" she scolded, facing me directly. \"I don\u0027t care if you listen to me because I\u0027m your mother and you have to - or because you love him and don\u0027t want to lose him, but you will listen.\" \"Like I have a choice,\" I muttered. \"You\u0027re an asset now,\" she repeated. \"See that your life choices don\u0027t make you a liability.\" \"Are you talking about Cary?\" Anger sharpened my voice. \"I\u0027m talking about the bruise on Gideon\u0027s jaw! Tell me that has nothing to do with you.\" I flushed. She tsked. \"I knew it. Yes, he\u0027s your lover and you see an intimate side to him that few see, but don\u0027t ever forget that he\u0027s also Gideon Cross. You\u0027ve got everything you need to be the perfect wife for a man of his stature, but you\u0027re still replaceable, Eva. What he\u0027s built is not. You jeopardize his empire and he\u0027ll leave you.\" My jaw tightened. \"Are you done?\" She ran her fingertips over my brows, her gaze shrewd and assessing. I knew she was giving me a mini- makeover in her mind, thinking of ways to improve what she\u0027d given me from birth. \"You think I\u0027m a coldhearted gold digger, but my concern is maternal, believe it or not. I want very desperately for you to be with a man who has the money and wherewithal to guard you with everything he has, so I\u0027ll know you\u0027re safe. And I want you to be with a man you love.\" \"I\u0027ve found him.\" \"And I can\u0027t tell you how thrilled I am. I\u0027m thrilled he\u0027s young and still open to taking risks, so he\u0027s more forgiving and understanding of your . quirks. And he knows,\" she whispered, her gaze softening and growing liquid. \"Just be careful. That\u0027s all I\u0027m trying to say. Don\u0027t give him any reason to turn away from you.\" \"If he did, that wouldn\u0027t be love.\" Her lips curved wryly and she pressed a kiss to my forehead.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reflected-in-you-crossfire-2/page-37.html","bookId":1923,"book":{"id":1923,"title":"Reflected in You (Crossfire #2)","description":"Storyline: Reflected in You (Crossfire #2) Gideon Cross.
