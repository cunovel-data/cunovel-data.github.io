Lie around naked, waiting for you to finish work and fuck me?\" His gaze held mine as he collected his mug and sipped his steaming coffee with too-calm deliberation.\\n\\n \"Are we going to argue?\" \"Are you going to be difficult? We talked about this.\\n\\n You know I can\u0027t leave Cary after what happened last night.\"\\n\\n The multibody tangle I\u0027d found in my living room gave new meaning to the word clusterfuck.\\n\\n I put the carton back in the fridge and absorbed the sensation of being drawn to him inexorably by the force of his will.\\n\\n It\u0027d been that way from the beginning.\\n\\n When he chose to, Gideon could make me feel his demands.\\n\\n And it was very, very difficult to ignore the part of me that begged to give him whatever he wanted.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re going to take care of business and I\u0027m going to take care of my best friend, then we\u0027ll go back to taking care of each other.\"\\n\\n \"I won\u0027t be back until Sunday night, Eva.\"\\n\\n Oh .\\n\\n I felt a sharp twinge in my belly at hearing we\u0027d be apart that long.\\n\\n Most couples didn\u0027t spend every free moment together, but we weren\u0027t like most people.\\n\\n We both had hang- ups, insecurities, and an addiction to each other that required regular contact to keep us functioning properly.\\n\\n I hated being apart from him.\\n\\n I rarely went more than a couple of hours without thinking of him.\\n\\n \"You can\u0027t stand the thought, either,\" he said quietly, studying me in that way he had that saw everything.\\n\\n \"By Sunday we\u0027ll both be worthless.\"\\n\\n I blew on the surface of my coffee, then took a quick sip.\\n\\n I was unsettled at the thought of going the entire weekend without him.\\n\\n Worse, I hated the thought of him spending that amount of time away from me.\\n\\n He had a world of choices and possibilities out there, women who weren\u0027t so screwed up and difficult to be with.\\n\\n Still, I managed to say, \"We both know that\u0027s not exactly healthy, Gideon.\"\\n\\n \"Says who? No one else knows what it\u0027s like to be us.\"\\n\\n Okay, I\u0027d give him that.\\n\\n \"We need to get to work,\" I said, knowing this impasse was going to drive both of us crazy all day.\\n\\n We\u0027d sort it out later, but for now we were stuck with it.\\n\\n Resting his hip against the counter, he crossed his ankles and stubbornly settled in.\\n\\n \"What we need is for you to come with me.\"\\n\\n \"Gideon.\"\\n\\n My foot began to tap against the travertine tile.\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t just give up my life for you.\\n\\n If I turn into arm candy, you\u0027ll get bored real quick.\\n\\n Hell, I\u0027d get sick of myself.\\n\\n It shouldn\u0027t kill us to spend a couple days straightening out other parts of our lives, even if we hate doing it.\"\\n\\n His gaze captured mine.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re too much trouble to be arm candy.\"\\n\\n \"Takes a troublemaker to know one.\"\\n\\n Gideon straightened, shrugging off his brooding sensuality and instantly capturing me with his severe intensity.\\n\\n So mercurial - like me.\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve gotten a lot of press lately, Eva.\\n\\n It\u0027s no secret that you\u0027re in New York.\\n\\n I can\u0027t leave you here while I\u0027m gone.\\n\\n Bring Cary with us if you have to.\\n\\n You can butt heads with him while you\u0027re waiting for me to finish work and fuck you.\"\\n\\n \"Ha.\"\\n\\n Even as I acknowledged his attempt to lighten the strain with humor, I realized what his real objection to being apart from me was - Nathan.\\n\\n My former stepbrother.\\n\\n The living nightmare from my past that Gideon seemed to fear might reappear in my present.\\n\\n It frightened me to concede that he wasn\u0027t totally wrong.\\n\\n The shield of anonymity that had protected me for years had been shattered by our highly public relationship.\\n\\n God .\\n\\n we totally didn\u0027t have the time to get into that mess, but I knew it wasn\u0027t a point Gideon would concede on.\\n\\n He was a man who claimed his possessions utterly, fought off his competitors with ruthless precision, and would never allow any harm to come to me.\\n\\n I was his safe place, which made me rare and invaluable to him.\\n\\n Gideon glanced at his watch.\\n\\n \"Time to go, angel.\"\\n\\n He fetched his jacket, then gestured for me to precede him through his luxurious living room, where I grabbed my purse and the bag holding my walking shoes and other necessities.\\n\\n A few moments later, we\u0027d finished the descent to the ground floor in his private elevator and slid into the back of his black Bentley SUV.\\n\\n \"Hi, Angus,\" I greeted his driver, who touched the brim of his old- fashioned chauffeur\u0027s hat.\\n\\n \"Good morning, Miss Tramell,\" he replied, smiling.\\n\\n He was an older gentleman, with a liberal sprinkling of white in his red hair.\\n\\n I liked him for a lot of reasons, not the least of which was the fact that he\u0027d been driving Gideon around since grade school and genuinely cared for him.\\n\\n A quick glance at the Rolex my mother and stepfather had given me told me I\u0027d make it to work on time .\\n\\n if we didn\u0027t get boxed in by traffic.\\n\\n Even as I thought this, Angus slid deftly into the sea of taxis and cars on the street.\\n\\n After the tense quiet of Gideon\u0027s apartment, the noise of Manhattan woke me as effectively as a jolt of caffeine.\\n\\n The blaring of horns and the thud of tires over a manhole cover invigorated me.\\n\\n Rapid-moving streams of pedestrians flanked both sides of the clogged street, while buildings stretched ambitiously toward the sky, keeping us in shadow even as the sun climbed.\\n\\n God, I seriously loved New York.\\n\\n I took the time every day to absorb it, to try to draw it into me.\\n\\n I settled into the leather seat back and reached for Gideon\u0027s hand, giving it a squeeze.\\n\\n \"Would you feel better if Cary and I left town for the weekend? Maybe a quick trip to Vegas?\" Gideon\u0027s gaze narrowed.\\n\\n \"Am I a threat to Cary? Is that why you won\u0027t consider Arizona?\" \"What? No.\\n\\n I don\u0027t think so.\"\\n\\n Shifting in the seat, I faced him.\\n\\n \"Sometimes it takes an all-nighter before I can get him to open up.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t think so?\" he repeated my answer, ignoring everything but the first words out of my mouth.\\n\\n \"He might feel like he can\u0027t reach out to me when he needs to talk because I\u0027m always with you,\" I clarified, steadying my mug with two hands as we drove over a pothole.\\n\\n \"Listen, you\u0027re going to have to get over any jealousy about Cary.\\n\\n When I say he\u0027s like a brother to me, Gideon, I\u0027m not kidding.\\n\\n You don\u0027t have to like him, but you have to understand that he\u0027s a permanent part of my life.\"\\n\\n \"Do you tell him the same thing about me?\" \"I don\u0027t have to.\\n\\n He knows.\\n\\n I\u0027m trying to reach a compromise here - \" \"I never compromise.\"\\n\\n My brows rose.\\n\\n \"In business, I\u0027m sure you don\u0027t.\\n\\n But this is a relationship, Gideon.\\n\\n It requires give and - \" Gideon\u0027s growl cut me off.\\n\\n \"My plane, my hotel, and if you leave the premises you take a security team with you.\"\\n\\n His sudden, reluctant capitulation surprised me silent for a long minute.\\n\\n Long enough for his brow to arch over those piercing blue eyes in a look that said take it or leave it.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t you think that\u0027s a little extreme?\" I prodded.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll have Cary with me.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ll forgive me if I don\u0027t trust him with your safety after last night.\"\\n\\n As he drank his coffee, his posture made it very clear that the conversation was done in his mind.\\n\\n He\u0027d given me his acceptable options.\\n\\n I might\u0027ve gotten bitchy about that kind of high-handedness if I didn\u0027t understand that taking care of me was his motivation.\\n\\n My past had vicious skeletons, and dating Gideon had put me in a media spotlight that could bring Nathan Barker right to my door.\\n\\n Plus, controlling everything around him was just part of who Gideon was.\\n\\n It came with the package and I had to make accommodations for that.\\n\\n \"Okay,\" I agreed.\\n\\n \"Which hotel is yours?\" \"I have a few.\\n\\n You can take your pick.\"\\n\\n He turned his head to look out the window.\\n\\n \"Scott will e-mail you the list.\\n\\n When you\u0027ve decided, let him know and he\u0027ll make the arrangements.\\n\\n We\u0027ll fly out together and return together.\"\\n\\n Leaning my shoulder into the seat, I took a drink of my coffee and noted the way his hand was fisted on his thigh.\\n\\n In the tinted window\u0027s reflection, Gideon\u0027s face was impassive, but I could feel his moodiness.\\n\\n \"Thank you,\" I murmured.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t.\\n\\n I\u0027m not happy about this, Eva.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reflected-in-you-crossfire-2/page-2.html","bookId":1923,"book":{"id":1923,"title":"Reflected in You (Crossfire #2)","description":"Storyline: Reflected in You (Crossfire #2) \\n Gideon Cross.
