Or did I just wish that he had? * * *\\n\\n The moment I walked into Cary\u0027s private room, he knew I was running on fumes.\\n\\n I\u0027d endured a tough Krav Maga session with Parker, then stopped by the apartment only long enough to shower and eat a tasteless instant- ramen meal.\\n\\n The shock of the salt and carbs to my system after a day without food was more than enough to exhaust me past the point of no return.\\n\\n \"You look like shit,\" he said, muting the television.\\n\\n \"Look who\u0027s talking,\" I shot back, feeling too raw to take any criticism.\\n\\n \"I got hit with a baseball bat.\\n\\n What\u0027s your excuse?\" I arranged the pillow and scratchy blanket on my cot, then told him about my day from beginning to end.\\n\\n \"And I haven\u0027t heard from Gideon since,\" I finished wearily.\\n\\n \"Even Brett got in touch with me after lunch.\\n\\n He left an envelope at the security desk with his phone number in it.\"\\n\\n He\u0027d also included the cash I left at the restaurant.\\n\\n \"Are you going to call him?\" Cary asked.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t want to think about Brett!\" I sprawled on my back on the cot and shoved my hands through my hair.\\n\\n \"I want to know what\u0027s wrong with Gideon.\\n\\n He\u0027s had a total personality transplant in the last thirty-six hours!\" \"Maybe it\u0027s this.\"\\n\\n I lifted my head off the pillow and saw him pointing at something on his bedside table.\\n\\n Rolling to my feet, I checked it out - a local gay periodical.\\n\\n \"Trey brought that over today,\" he said.Cary\u0027s picture capped a front-page piece covering his attack - including speculation that the assault might have been a hate crime.\\n\\n His living situation with me and my romantic entanglement with Gideon Cross were mentioned, for no other reason, it seemed, than for a salacious punch.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s on their website, too,\" he added quietly.\\n\\n \"I figure someone at the agency gossiped, and it spread and turned into someone\u0027s political crap.\\n\\n Honestly, I\u0027m having a hard time imagining Cross giving a shit - \" \"About your sexual orientation? He doesn\u0027t.\\n\\n He\u0027s not like that.\"\\n\\n \"But his PR people might feel differently.\\n\\n Could be why he wants to keep you under the radar.\\n\\n And if he\u0027s worried that someone might go after you to get to me, that explains why he wants to keep you tucked away and off the streets.\"\\n\\n \"Why wouldn\u0027t he tell me that?\" I set the paper down.\\n\\n \"Why is he being such a prick? Everything was so wonderful while we were gone.\\n\\n He was wonderful.\\n\\n I thought we\u0027d turned a corner.\\n\\n I kept thinking he wasn\u0027t anything like the man I\u0027d first met, and now he\u0027s worse.\\n\\n There\u0027s this .\\n\\n I don\u0027t know.\\n\\n He\u0027s a million miles away from me now.\\n\\n I don\u0027t understand it.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not the guy to ask, Eva.\"\\n\\n Cary grabbed my hand and squeezed.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s the one with the answers.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re right.\"\\n\\n I went to my purse and pulled out my phone.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll be back in a bit.\"\\n\\n I went to the little enclosed balcony off the visitors\u0027 waiting area and called Gideon.\\n\\n The phone rang and rang, eventually going to voice mail.\\n\\n I tried his home number instead.\\n\\n After the third ring, Gideon answered.\\n\\n \"Cross,\" he said curtly.\\n\\n \"Hi.\"\\n\\n There was silence for the length of a heartbeat, then, \"Hang on.\"\\n\\n I heard a door open.\\n\\n The sound on the phone changed - he\u0027d stepped away from wherever he\u0027d been.\\n\\n \"Is everything all right?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n I rubbed at my tired eyes.\\n\\n \"I miss you.\"\\n\\n He sighed.\\n\\n \"I .\\n\\n I can\u0027t talk now, Eva.\"\\n\\n \"Why not? I don\u0027t understand why you\u0027re acting so cold to me.\\n\\n Did I do something wrong?\" I heard murmuring and realized he\u0027d muffled the receiver to talk to someone else.\\n\\n A horrible feeling of betrayal tightened my chest, making it hard to breathe.\\n\\n \"Gideon.\\n\\n Who\u0027s at your place with you?\" \"I have to go.\"\\n\\n \"Tell me who\u0027s there with you!\" \"Angus will be at the hospital at seven.\\n\\n Get some sleep, angel.\"\\n\\n The line went dead.\\n\\n I lowered my hand and stared at my phone, as if it could somehow reveal to me what the fuck had just happened.\\n\\n I made it back to Cary\u0027s room, felt weighted down and miserable as I pushed open the door.\\n\\n Cary took one look at me and sighed.\\n\\n \"You look like your puppy just died, baby girl.\"\\n\\n The dam broke.\\n\\n I started sobbing.\\n\\n Chapter 14\\n\\n I hardly slept all night.\\n\\n I tossed and turned, drifting in and out of consciousness.\\n\\n The frequent nurse visits to check on Cary also woke me.\\n\\n His brain scans and lab reports were looking good and there was nothing absolutely definitive to worry about, but I hadn\u0027t been there for him when he\u0027d first gotten hurt.\\n\\n I felt like I needed to be there for him now, sleep or no sleep.\\n\\n Just before six, I gave up and got out of bed.\\n\\n Grabbing my tablet and wireless keyboard, I headed down to the cafeteria for coffee.\\n\\n I pulled up a chair at one of the tables and prepared to write a letter to Gideon.\\n\\n In the short amounts of time I\u0027d managed to pin him down the last couple of days, I hadn\u0027t been able to get my thoughts across to him.\\n\\n Writing it all out would have to be the way it got done.\\n\\n Maintaining steady, open communication was the only way we were going to survive as a couple.\\n\\n I sipped my coffee and began typing, starting with my thanks for the beautiful weekend away and how much it meant to me.\\n\\n I told him how I thought our relationship had taken a massive leap forward during the trip, which only made the week\u0027s backslide harder to bear - \"Eva.\\n\\n What a pleasant surprise!\" Turning my head, I found Dr.\\n\\n Terrence Lucas standing behind me holding a disposable coffee cup like the one I\u0027d filled for myself.\\n\\n He was dressed for work in slacks and tie with a white lab coat.\\n\\n \"Hi,\" I greeted him, hoping I hid my wariness.\\n\\n \"Mind if I join you?\" he asked, rounding me.\\n\\n \"Not at all.\"\\n\\n I watched him take the seat beside me, and I refreshed my memory of his appearance.\\n\\n His hair was pure white, without a hint of gray, but his handsome face was unlined.\\n\\n His eyes were an unusual shade of green and they were keen with intelligence.\\n\\n His smile was both reassuring and charming.\\n\\n I suspected he was popular with his patients - and their mothers.\\n\\n \"There has to be some special reason,\" he began, \"for you to be in the hospital long before visiting hours.\"\\n\\n \"My roommate\u0027s here.\"\\n\\n I didn\u0027t volunteer any more information, but he guessed.\\n\\n \"So Gideon Cross threw his money around and made arrangements for you.\"\\n\\n He shook his head and took a sip of his coffee.\\n\\n \"And you\u0027re grateful.\\n\\n But what will it cost you?\" I sat back, offended on Gideon\u0027s behalf that his generosity was reduced to having an ulterior motive.\\n\\n \"Why do you two dislike each other so much?\" His eyes lost their softness.\\n\\n \"He hurt someone very close to me.\"\\n\\n \"Your wife.\\n\\n He told me.\"\\n\\n I could tell that startled him.\\n\\n \"But that wasn\u0027t the beginning, was it? That was a result.\"\\n\\n \"You know what he did, and you\u0027re still with him?\" Lucas set his elbows on the table.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s doing the same thing to you.\\n\\n You look exhausted and depressed.\\n\\n That\u0027s part of the game to him, you know.\\n\\n He\u0027s an expert at worshipping a woman as if he needs her to breathe.\\n\\n Then suddenly he can\u0027t bear the sight of her.\"\\n\\n The statement was a painfully accurate description of my present reality with Gideon.\\n\\n My pulse quickened.\\n\\n His gaze slid to my throat, then back to my face.\\n\\n His mouth curved in a mocking, knowing smile.\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve experienced what I\u0027m talking about.\\n\\n He\u0027s going to continue to play with you until you rely on his mood to gauge your own.\\n\\n Then he\u0027ll get bored and dump you.\"\\n\\n \"What happened between you?\" I asked again, knowing that was key.\\n\\n \"Gideon Cross is a narcissistic sociopath,\" he went on as if I hadn\u0027t spoken.\\n\\n \"I believe he\u0027s a misogynist.\\n\\n He uses his money to seduce women, then despises them for being shallow enough to find his wealth attractive.\\n\\n He uses sex to control, and you never know what sort of mood you\u0027ll find him in.\\n\\n That\u0027s part of the rush - when you\u0027re always steeling yourself for the worst, you psych yourself up for a surge of relief when he\u0027s at his best.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t know him,\" I said smoothly, refusing to take the bait.\\n\\n \"And neither does your wife.\"\\n\\n \"Neither do you.\"\\n\\n He sat back and drank his coffee, appearing as unruffled as I tried to be.\\n\\n \"No one does.\\n\\n He\u0027s a master manipulator and liar.\\n\\n Don\u0027t underestimate him.\\n\\n He\u0027s a twisted, dangerous man capable of just about anything.\"\\n\\n \"The fact that you won\u0027t explain his grudge against you makes me think you\u0027re at fault.\"\\n\\n \"You shouldn\u0027t make assumptions.\\n\\n There are some things I\u0027m not at liberty to discuss.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s convenient.\"\\n\\n He sighed.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not your adversary, Eva, and Cross doesn\u0027t need anyone to fight his battles.\\n\\n You don\u0027t have to believe me.\\n\\n Frankly, I\u0027m so bitter I wouldn\u0027t believe me if I were in your place.\\n\\n But you\u0027re a beautiful, smart young lady.\"\\n\\n I hadn\u0027t been lately, but it was my responsibility to fix that.\\n\\n Or walk.\\n\\n \"If you take a step back,\" he continued, \"and look at what he\u0027s doing to you, how you\u0027re feeling about yourself since you\u0027ve been with him, and whether you\u0027re truly fulfilled by your relationship, you\u0027ll come to your own conclusions.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reflected-in-you-crossfire-2/page-41.html","bookId":1923,"book":{"id":1923,"title":"Reflected in You (Crossfire #2)","description":"Storyline: Reflected in You (Crossfire #2) \\n Gideon Cross.
