Years? Hating to think of it, I closed my eyes and started to drift.\\n\\n The light flicked on.\\n\\n \"Eva.\\n\\n Get up.\"\\n\\n Gideon strode into the room and straight to my dresser, digging through my clothes.\\n\\n I blinked at him, noting that he\u0027d changed into slacks and a button-down dress shirt.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s wrong?\" \"It\u0027s Cary,\" he said grimly.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s in the hospital.\"\\n\\n A cab was waiting for us at the curb when we left my apartment building.\\n\\n Gideon ushered me in, then slid in beside me.\\n\\n The cab seemed to pull away very slowly.\\n\\n Everything seemed to be moving slowly.\\n\\n I clutched at Gideon\u0027s sleeve.\\n\\n \"What happened?\" \"He was attacked Friday night.\"\\n\\n \"How do you know?\" \"Your mother and Stanton both left messages on my cell phone.\"\\n\\n \"My mother .\\n\\n ?\" I looked at him blankly.\\n\\n \"Why didn\u0027t she .\\n\\n ?\" No, she couldn\u0027t call me.\\n\\n I hadn\u0027t had my phone.\\n\\n Guilt and worry drowned me, making it hard to breathe.\\n\\n \"Eva.\"\\n\\n He put his arm around my shoulders, urging me to rest my head against him.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t worry until we know more.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s been days, Gideon.\\n\\n And I wasn\u0027t here.\"\\n\\n Tears poured down my face and wouldn\u0027t stop, even after we arrived at the hospital.\\n\\n I barely registered the exterior of the building, my attention dulled by the hard driving anxiety pounding through me.\\n\\n I thanked God for Gideon, who was so calm and in control.\\n\\n A staff member provided the number of Cary\u0027s room, but his helpfulness ended there.\\n\\n Gideon made a few middle-of-the-night phone calls that got me access to see Cary, even though it was well outside visiting hours.\\n\\n Gideon had been a very generous benefactor at times and that wasn\u0027t easily dismissed or forgotten.\\n\\n When I stepped into Cary\u0027s private room and saw him, my heart shattered so completely, my knees went weak.\\n\\n Only Gideon kept me from falling.\\n\\n The man I thought of as my brother, the best friend I\u0027d ever had or ever would have, lay silent and unmoving in the bed.\\n\\n His head was bandaged and his eyes blackened.\\n\\n One of his arms was stuck with intravenous lines, while the other was in a cast.\\n\\n I wouldn\u0027t have recognized him, if I hadn\u0027t known who he was.\\n\\n Flowers covered every flat surface, cheerful and colorful bouquets.\\n\\n There were balloons, too, and a few cards.\\n\\n I knew some would be from my mother and Stanton, who were certainly paying for Cary\u0027s care as well.\\n\\n We were his family.\\n\\n And everyone had been there for him but me.\\n\\n Gideon led me closer, his arm tight around my waist to hold me up.\\n\\n I was sobbing, the tears flowing thick and hot.\\n\\n It was everything I could do to remain silent.\\n\\n Still, Cary must have heard me or sensed me.\\n\\n His eyelids fluttered, then opened.\\n\\n His beautiful green eyes were bloodshot and unfocused.\\n\\n It took him a minute to find me.\\n\\n When he did, he blinked a few times, and then tears started rolling down his temples.\\n\\n \"Cary.\"\\n\\n I rushed to him and slipped my hand in his.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m here.\"\\n\\n He gripped me so tightly, it was painful.\\n\\n \"Eva.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry I took so long.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t have my phone.\\n\\n I had no idea.\\n\\n I would\u0027ve been here if I\u0027d known.\"\\n\\n \"S\u0027okay.\\n\\n You\u0027re here now.\"\\n\\n His throat worked on a swallow.\\n\\n \"God .\\n\\n everything hurts.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll get a nurse,\" Gideon said, running his hand down my back before slipping silently out of the room.\\n\\n I saw a small pitcher and cup with straw on the rolling tray table.\\n\\n \"Are you thirsty?\" \"Very.\"\\n\\n \"Can I sit you up? Or no?\" I was afraid to do anything to cause him pain.\\n\\n \"Yeah.\"\\n\\n Using the remote lying near his hand, I raised the top part of the bed so that he was reclined.\\n\\n Then I brought the straw to his lips and watched him drink greedily.\\n\\n He relaxed with a sigh.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re a sight for sore eyes, baby girl.\"\\n\\n \"What the hell happened?\" I set the empty cup down and grabbed his hand again.\\n\\n \"Fuck if I know.\"\\n\\n His voice was weak, almost a whisper.\\n\\n \"Got jumped.\\n\\n With a bat.\"\\n\\n \"With a bat?\" Just the thought made me physically ill.\\n\\n The brutality of it.\\n\\n The violence .\\n\\n \"Was he insane?\" \"Of course,\" he snapped, a deep line of pain between his brows. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reflected-in-you-crossfire-2/page-35.html","bookId":1923,"book":{"id":1923,"title":"Reflected in You (Crossfire #2)","description":"Storyline: Reflected in You (Crossfire #2) \\n Gideon Cross.
