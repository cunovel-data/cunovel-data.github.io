I didn\u0027t know yet.\\n\\n Up until now, I\u0027d been the San Diego transplant who got swept into the orbit of an enigmatic and incredibly powerful man.\\n\\n That Eva was on Day Eight After Gideon: Round Two curled in a corner licking her wounds and would be for a long time.\\n\\n Maybe forever, because I couldn\u0027t imagine that I\u0027d ever fall in love again like I had with Gideon.\\n\\n For better or worse, he was my soul mate.\\n\\n The other half of me.\\n\\n In many ways, he was my reflection.\\n\\n \"Eva?\" Cary prodded, studying me.\\n\\n \"I want everything done,\" I said decisively.\\n\\n \"I want a new haircut.\\n\\n Something short and flirty and chic.\\n\\n I want my nails painted fire engine red - fingers and toes.\\n\\n I want to be a new Eva.\"\\n\\n Cary\u0027s brows rose.\\n\\n \"Nails, yes.\\n\\n Hair, maybe.\\n\\n You shouldn\u0027t make sweeping decisions when you\u0027re fucked up over a guy.\\n\\n They come back to haunt you.\"\\n\\n My chin lifted.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m doing it, Cary Taylor.\\n\\n You can either help or just shut up and watch.\"\\n\\n \"Eva!\" My mother practically squealed.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re going to look amazing! I know just the thing to do with your hair.\\n\\n You\u0027ll love it!\" Cary\u0027s lips twitched.\\n\\n \"All righty, then, baby girl.\\n\\n Let\u0027s see what New Eva looks like.\"\\n\\n New Eva turned out to be a modern, slightly edgy sexpot.\\n\\n My once long, straight blond hair was now shoulder length and cut in long layers, with platinum highlights sprinkled throughout and framing my face.\\n\\n I\u0027d had my makeup done, too, to see what sort of look I should pair with my new hairdo, and I learned that smoky gray for my eyes was the way to go, along with soft pink lip gloss.\\n\\n In the end, I hadn\u0027t gone with red for my nails and chose chocolate instead.\\n\\n I really liked it.\\n\\n For now, anyway.\\n\\n I was willing to admit I might be going through a phase.\\n\\n \"Okay, I take it back,\" Cary said, whistling.\\n\\n \"Clearly you wear breakups well.\"\\n\\n \"See?\" my mother crowed, grinning.\\n\\n \"I told you! Now you look like an urban sophisticate.\"\\n\\n \"Is that what you call it?\" I studied my reflection, amazed at the transformation.\\n\\n I appeared a bit older.\\n\\n Definitely more polished.\\n\\n Certainly sexier.\\n\\n It boosted my spirits to see someone else looking back at me besides the hollow-eyed young woman I\u0027d been seeing for nearly two weeks now.\\n\\n Somehow, my thinner face and sad eyes paired well with the bolder style.\\n\\n My mom insisted we go out for dinner since we all looked so good.\\n\\n She called Stanton and told him to get ready for a night out, and I could tell from her end of the conversation that she was delighting him with her girlish excitement.\\n\\n She left it to him to pick the place and make the arrangements, then continued with my makeover by picking a little black dress out of my closet.\\n\\n As I slipped it on, she held up one of my ivory cocktail dresses.\\n\\n \"Go for it,\" I told her, finding it amusing and pretty amazing that my mother could pull off wearing the clothes of someone nearly twenty years younger.\\n\\n When we were set, she went to Cary\u0027s room and helped him get ready.\\n\\n I watched from the doorway as my mother fussed over him, talking the whole time in that way she had that didn\u0027t require reciprocal conversation.\\n\\n Cary stood there with a sweet smile on his face, his eyes following her around the room with something like joy.\\n\\n Her hands brushed over his broad shoulders, smoothing the pressed linen of his dress shirt, and then she expertly knotted his tie and stepped back to take in her handiwork.\\n\\n The sleeve on his casted arm was unbuttoned and rolled up, and his face still had yellow and purple bruising, but nothing could detract from the overall effect of Cary Taylor dressed for a casually elegant night out.\\n\\n My mother\u0027s smile lit up the room.\\n\\n \"Stunning, Cary.\\n\\n Simply stunning.\"\\n\\n \"Thank you.\"\\n\\n Stepping forward, she kissed him on the cheek.\\n\\n \"Almost as beautiful on the outside as you are on the inside.\"\\n\\n I watched him blink and look at me, his green eyes filled with confusion.\\n\\n I leaned into the doorjamb and said, \"Some of us can see right through you, Cary Taylor.\\n\\n Those gorgeous looks don\u0027t fool us.\\n\\n We know you\u0027ve got that big beautiful heart inside you.\"\\n\\n \"Come on!\" my mom said, grabbing both of our hands and pulling us out of the room.\\n\\n When we made it down to the lobby level, we found Stanton\u0027s limousine waiting.\\n\\n My stepfather climbed out of the back and wrapped his arms around my mom, pressing a gentle kiss to her cheek because he knew she wouldn\u0027t want to mess up her lipstick.\\n\\n Stanton was an attractive man, with snow white hair and denim blue eyes.\\n\\n His face bore some traces of his years, but he was still a very attractive man, one who stayed fit and active.\\n\\n \"Eva!\" He hugged me, too, and kissed my cheek.\\n\\n \"You look ravishing.\"\\n\\n I smiled, not quite sure whether being \"ravishing\" meant I looked like I was going to ravish someone or was waiting to be ravished.\\n\\n Stanton shook Cary\u0027s hand and gave him a gentle slap to the shoulder.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s good to see you back on your feet, young man.\\n\\n You gave us all a scare.\"\\n\\n \"Thank you.\\n\\n For everything.\"\\n\\n \"No thanks necessary,\" Stanton said, waving it off.\\n\\n \"Ever.\"\\n\\n My mom took a deep breath, then let it out.\\n\\n Her eyes were bright as she watched Stanton.\\n\\n She caught me looking at her and smiled, and it was a peaceful smile.\\n\\n We ended up at a private club with a big band and two excellent singers - one male and one female.\\n\\n They switched frequently throughout the evening, providing the perfect accompaniment to a candlelit meal served in a high-backed velvet booth right out of a classic Manhattan society photo.\\n\\n I couldn\u0027t help but be charmed.\\n\\n Between dinner and dessert, Cary asked me to dance.\\n\\n We\u0027d taken formal dance classes together, at my mother\u0027s insistence, but we had to take it easy with Cary\u0027s injuries.\\n\\n We basically just swayed in place, enjoying the contentment that came from ending a happy day with a good meal shared with loved ones.\\n\\n \"Look at them,\" Cary said, watching Stanton expertly lead my mom around the dance floor.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s crazy about her.\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\\n\\n And she\u0027s good for him.\\n\\n They give each other what they need.\"\\n\\n He looked down at me.\\n\\n \"You thinking about your dad?\" \"A little.\"\\n\\n I reached up and ran my fingers through his hair, thinking of longer and darker strands that felt like thick silk.\\n\\n \"I never really thought of myself as romantic.\\n\\n I mean, I like romance and grand gestures and that tipsy feeling you get when you\u0027re crushing hard on someone.\\n\\n But the whole Prince Charming fantasy and marrying the love of your life wasn\u0027t my thing.\"\\n\\n \"You and me, baby girl, we\u0027re too jaded.\\n\\n We just want mind-blowing sex with someone who knows we\u0027re fucked up and accepts it.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reflected-in-you-crossfire-2/page-50.html","bookId":1923,"book":{"id":1923,"title":"Reflected in You (Crossfire #2)","description":"Storyline: Reflected in You (Crossfire #2) \\n Gideon Cross.
