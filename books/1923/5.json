I owe you one, Eva, for the way I introduced myself.\"\\n\\n I thought about that.\\n\\n Yeah, she owed me for when she ambushed me in the bathroom with her catty jealous bullshit.\\n\\n Not that I bought it as her sole motivation.\\n\\n Maybe I was just the lesser of two evils.\\n\\n Maybe she was keeping her enemies close.\\n\\n \"All right.\\n\\n Thank you.\"\\n\\n No denying I felt better.\\n\\n A weight I hadn\u0027t realized I was carrying around was suddenly relieved.\\n\\n \"Something else,\" Magdalene went on.\\n\\n \"He went after you.\"\\n\\n My grip tightened on the phone receiver.\\n\\n Gideon always came after me .\\n\\n because I was always running.\\n\\n My recovery was so fragile that I\u0027d learned to protect it at all costs.\\n\\n When something threatened my stability, I ditched it.\\n\\n \"There have been other women in his life who\u0027ve tried ultimatums like that, Eva.\\n\\n They got bored or they wanted his attention or some kind of grand gesture .\\n\\n So they walked away and expected him to come after them.\\n\\n You know what he did?\" \"Nothing,\" I said softly, knowing my man.\\n\\n A man who never spent social time with women he slept with and never slept with women he associated with socially.\\n\\n Corinne and I were the sole exceptions to that rule, which was yet another reason why his ex sent me into fits of jealousy.\\n\\n \"Nothing more than making sure Angus dropped them off safely,\" she confirmed, making me think it\u0027d been a tactic she\u0027d tried at some point.\\n\\n \"But when you left, he couldn\u0027t chase after you fast enough.\\n\\n And he wasn\u0027t himself when he said good-bye.\\n\\n He seemed .\\n\\n off.\"\\n\\n Because he\u0027d felt fear.\\n\\n My eyes closed as I mentally kicked myself.\\n\\n Hard.\\n\\n Gideon had told me more than once that it terrified him when I ran, because he couldn\u0027t handle the thought that I might not come back.\\n\\n What good did it do to say that I couldn\u0027t imagine living without him when I so often showed him otherwise with my actions? Was it any wonder he hadn\u0027t opened up to me about his past? I had to stop running.\\n\\n Gideon and I were both going to have to stand and fight for this, for us, if we were going to have any hope of making our relationship work.\\n\\n \"Do I owe you now?\" I asked neutrally, returning Mark\u0027s wave as he left for lunch.\\n\\n Magdalene exhaled in a rush.\\n\\n \"Gideon and I have known each other a long time.\\n\\n Our mothers are best friends.\\n\\n You and I will see each other around, Eva, and I\u0027m hoping we can find a way to avoid any awkwardness.\"\\n\\n The woman had come up to me and told me that the minute Gideon \"shoved his dick\" in me, I was \"done.\"\\n\\n And she\u0027d hit me with that at a moment when I was especially vulnerable.\\n\\n \"Listen, Magdalene, if you don\u0027t cause drama, we\u0027ll get by.\"\\n\\n And since she was being so forthright .\\n\\n \"I can screw up my relationship with Gideon all by myself, trust me.\\n\\n I don\u0027t need any help.\"\\n\\n She laughed softly.\\n\\n \"That was my mistake, I think - I was too careful and too accommodating.\\n\\n He has to work at it with you.\\n\\n Anyway .\\n\\n I\u0027ve taken up my minute.\\n\\n I\u0027ll let you go.\"\\n\\n \"Enjoy your weekend,\" I said, in lieu of thanks.\\n\\n I still couldn\u0027t trust her motivation.\\n\\n \"You, too.\"\\n\\n As I returned the receiver to its cradle, my gaze went to the photos of me and Gideon.\\n\\n I was abruptly overwhelmed by feelings of greed and possession.\\n\\n He was mine, yet I couldn\u0027t be sure from one day to the next whether he\u0027d stay mine.\\n\\n And the thought of any other woman having him made me insane.\\n\\n I pulled open my bottom drawer and dug my smartphone out of my purse.\\n\\n Driven by the need to have him thinking as fiercely about me, I texted him about my sudden desperate hunger to devour him whole: I\u0027d give anything to be sucking your cock right now.\\n\\n Just thinking about how he looked when I took him in my mouth .\\n\\n the feral sounds he made when he was about to come .\\n\\n Standing, I deleted the text the moment I saw it\u0027d been delivered, then dropped my phone back in my purse.\\n\\n Since it was noon, I closed all the windows on my computer and headed out to reception to find Megumi.\\n\\n \"You hungry for anything in particular?\" she asked, pushing to her feet and giving me a chance to admire her belted, sleeveless lavender dress.\\n\\n I coughed because her question came so soon after my text.\\n\\n \"No.\\n\\n Your choice.\\n\\n I\u0027m not picky.\"\\n\\n We pushed out through the glass doors to reach the elevators.\\n\\n \"I am so ready for the weekend,\" Megumi said with a groan as she stabbed the call button with an acrylic- tipped finger.\\n\\n \"A day and a half left to go.\"\\n\\n \"Got something fun planned?\" \"That remains to be seen.\"\\n\\n She sighed and tucked her hair behind her ear.\\n\\n \"Blind date,\" she explained ruefully.\\n\\n \"Ah.\\n\\n Do you trust the person setting you up?\" \"My roommate.\\n\\n I expect the guy will at least be physically attractive, because I know where she sleeps at night and paybacks are a bitch.\"\\n\\n I was smiling as an elevator car reached our floor and we stepped inside.\\n\\n \"Well, that ups your odds for a good time.\"\\n\\n \"Not really, since she found him by going on a blind date with him first.\\n\\n She swears he\u0027s great, just more my type than hers.\"\\n\\n \"Hmm.\"\\n\\n \"I know, right?\" Megumi shook her head and looked up at the decorative, old-fashioned needle above the car doors that marked the passing floors.\\n\\n \"You\u0027ll have to let me know how it goes.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, yeah.\\n\\n Wish me luck.\"\\n\\n \"Absolutely.\"\\n\\n We\u0027d just stepped out into the lobby when I felt my purse vibrate beneath my arm.\\n\\n As we passed through the turnstiles, I dug for my phone and felt my stomach tighten at the sight of Gideon\u0027s name.\\n\\n He was calling, not sexting me back.\\n\\n \"Excuse me,\" I said to Megumi before answering.\\n\\n She waved it off nonchalantly.\\n\\n \"Go for it.\"\\n\\n \"Hey,\" I greeted him playfully.\\n\\n \"Eva.\"\\n\\n I missed a step hearing the way he growled my name.\\n\\n There was a wealth of promise in the roughness of his voice.\\n\\n Slowing, I found I was speechless, just from hearing him say my name with that edginess I craved - the sharp bite that told me he wanted to be inside me more than he wanted anything else in the world.\\n\\n While people flowed around me, entering and exiting the building, I was halted by the weighted silence on my phone.\\n\\n The unspoken and nearly irresistible demand.\\n\\n He made no sound at all - I couldn\u0027t even hear him breathing - but I felt his hunger.\\n\\n If I didn\u0027t have Megumi waiting patiently for me, I\u0027d be riding an elevator to the top floor to satisfy his unvoiced command to make good on my offer.\\n\\n The memory of the time I\u0027d sucked him off in his office simmered through me, making my mouth water.\\n\\n I swallowed.\\n\\n \"Gideon .\"\\n\\n \"You wanted my attention - now you have it.\\n\\n I want to hear you say those words.\"\\n\\n I felt my face flush.\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t.\\n\\n Not here.\\n\\n Let me call you later.\"\\n\\n \"Step over by the column and out of the way.\"\\n\\n Startled, I looked around for him.\\n\\n Then I remembered that the Caller ID put him in his office.\\n\\n My gaze lifted, searching for the security cameras. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reflected-in-you-crossfire-2/page-5.html","bookId":1923,"book":{"id":1923,"title":"Reflected in You (Crossfire #2)","description":"Storyline: Reflected in You (Crossfire #2) \\n Gideon Cross.
