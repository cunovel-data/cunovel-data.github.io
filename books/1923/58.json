I don\u0027t remember leaving Parker\u0027s studio or telling Clancy where to take me. I don\u0027t remember checking in with the front desk or riding the elevator up. When I found myself in the private foyer facing Gideon\u0027s door, I had to stop a moment, unsure of how I\u0027d gotten from the bleachers to that point. I rang the bell and waited. When no one answered, I sank to the floor and leaned back against the door. Gideon found me there. The elevator doors opened and he stepped out, stopping abruptly when he saw me. He was dressed in workout clothes and his hair was still damp with sweat. He\u0027d never looked more wonderful. He was staring at me, unmoving, so I explained, \"I don\u0027t have a key anymore.\" I didn\u0027t get up because I wasn\u0027t sure my legs would support me. He crouched. \"Eva? What\u0027s wrong?\" \"I ran into Detective Graves tonight.\" I swallowed past the knot in my throat. \"They\u0027re dropping the case.\" His chest expanded on a deep breath. With that sound, I knew. Dark desolation shadowed Gideon\u0027s beautiful eyes. He knew that I knew. The truth hung heavy in the air between us, a near-tangible thing. I\u0027d kill for you, give up everything I own for you . but I won\u0027t give you up. Gideon fell to his knees on the cold, hard marble. His head bowed. Waiting. I shifted, mirroring his kneeling pose. I lifted his chin. Touched his face with my hands and my lips. My gratitude for his gift whispered over his skin: Thank you . thank you . thank you. He caught me to him, his arms banded tight around me. His face pressed into my throat. \"Where do we go from here?\" I held him. \"Wherever this takes us. Together.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reflected-in-you-crossfire-2/page-58.html","bookId":1923,"book":{"id":1923,"title":"Reflected in You (Crossfire #2)","description":"Storyline: Reflected in You (Crossfire #2) Gideon Cross. As beautiful and flawless on the outside as he was damaged and tormented on the inside. He was a bright, scorching flame that singed me with the darkest of pleasures. I couldn\u0027t stay away. I didn\u0027t want to. He was my addiction... my every desire... mine. My past was as violent as his, and I was just as broken. Weâ€™d never work. It was too hard, too painful... except when it was perfect. Those moments when the driving hunger and desperate love were the most exquisite insanity. We were bound by our need. And our passion would take us beyond our limits to the sweetest, sharpest edge of obsession...","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/reflected-in-you-crossfire-2.jpg","author":"Sylvia Day","type":"Young Adult","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/reflected-in-you-crossfire-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:08 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 9:50:36 AM"}}
