Men are so predictable.\\n\\n Cary suggested I blow you to make you happy.\\n\\n No .\\n\\n don\u0027t get excited.\\n\\n That\u0027s not going to happen.\"\\n\\n I hooked my thumbs in the waistband of my panties and rocked back on my heels.\\n\\n I had to give him points for keeping his eyes on mine and not on my breasts.\\n\\n \"I think you owe me, ace.\\n\\n Big-time.\\n\\n I\u0027ve been an exceptionally understanding girlfriend under the circumstances, don\u0027t you think?\" His brow arched.\\n\\n \"I mean, I\u0027d like to see what you would do,\" I went on, \"if you came over to my place and caught an ex- boyfriend stepping outside still tucking his shirt in his pants.\\n\\n Then, when you came upstairs, you found my couch messed up and me fresh from a shower.\"\\n\\n Gideon\u0027s jaw tightened.\\n\\n \"Neither of us wants to see what I\u0027d do.\"\\n\\n \"So we\u0027re both agreed that I\u0027ve been pretty damn awesome under extraordinary circumstances.\"\\n\\n I crossed my arms, knowing how that would showcase the assets he loved.\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve made it very clear how you\u0027d choose to punish me.\\n\\n How would you choose to reward me?\" \"Is it my choice?\" he drawled, his eyes heavy-lidded.\\n\\n I smiled.\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n He set my bra on his keyboard and unfolded from the chair in a leisurely, graceful rise.\\n\\n \"Then that\u0027s your reward, angel.\\n\\n What do you want?\" \"I want you to stop being grumpy, for starters.\"\\n\\n \"Grumpy?\" His lips twitched with a suppressed smile.\\n\\n \"Well, I woke up without you, and now I face two more mornings of the same.\"\\n\\n I dropped my arms to my sides and went to him, placing my palms flat to his broad chest.\\n\\n \"Is that really all it is?\"\"Eva.\"\\n\\n He was such a strong, physically powerful man, and yet he could touch me with such reverence.\\n\\n I ducked my head, knowing something in my voice had given me away.\\n\\n He was too perceptive.\\n\\n Cupping my jaw in his hands, Gideon tipped my head back and searched my face.\\n\\n \"Talk to me.\"\\n\\n \"I feel like you\u0027re pulling away.\"\\n\\n A low growl rumbled through the air between us.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve got a lot on my mind.\\n\\n That doesn\u0027t mean I\u0027m not thinking about you.\"\\n\\n \"I feel it, Gideon.\\n\\n There\u0027s distance between us that wasn\u0027t there before.\"\\n\\n His hands slid down to my neck, wrapping around it.\\n\\n \"There\u0027s no distance.\\n\\n You\u0027ve got me by the throat, Eva.\"\\n\\n His grip tightened fractionally.\\n\\n \"Can\u0027t you feel that?\" I sucked in a quick, tight breath.\\n\\n Agitation spurred my heartbeat, a physical response to fear that came entirely from within and not from Gideon, who I knew absolutely would never physically harm me or put me in danger.\\n\\n \"Sometimes,\" he said huskily, watching me with searing intensity, \"I can hardly breathe.\"\\n\\n I might\u0027ve broken free if not for his eyes, which revealed such yearning and turmoil.\\n\\n He was making me feel the same loss of power, the same sense of being dependent on someone else for every breath I took.\\n\\n So I did the opposite of running.\\n\\n Tilting my head back, I surrendered, and the tingles of fear left me in a rush.\\n\\n I was learning that Gideon was right about my desire to give up control to him.\\n\\n Doing so soothed something inside me, some need I hadn\u0027t realized I possessed.\\n\\n There was a long pause, filled only by his breathing.\\n\\n I sensed him warring with his emotions and wondered what they were, wondered why he was so conflicted.\\n\\n He released the tension with a deep exhalation.\\n\\n \"What do you need, Eva?\" \"You - a mile high.\"\\n\\n His hands slid over my shoulders and squeezed, then caressed the length of my arms.\\n\\n His fingers linked with mine and he nuzzled our temples together.\\n\\n \"What is it with you, sex, and modes of transportation?\" \"I\u0027ll take you anyway I can get you,\" I told him, repeating the sentiment he\u0027d once said to me.\\n\\n \"It\u0027ll probably be next weekend before I\u0027m good to go again, thanks to my period.\"\\n\\n \"Fuck.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s the idea.\"\\n\\n Reaching for his coat, he wrapped it around me and ushered me out of the cabin.\\n\\n \"Oh, God.\"\\n\\n My hands fisted the sheets beneath me, my back arching as Gideon pinned my hips to the bed and fluttered his tongue across my clit.\\n\\n My skin was coated in a fine sheen of sweat, my vision blurring as my core tightened viciously in preparation for orgasm.\\n\\n My pulse was thrumming, racing in unison with the steady hum of the jet\u0027s engines.\\n\\n I\u0027d come twice already, as much from the sight of his dark head between my legs as from his wickedly gifted mouth.\\n\\n My panties were ruined, literally shredded by his grip, and he was still fully dressed.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m ready.\"\\n\\n I pushed my fingers into his hair, feeling the dampness at the roots.\\n\\n His restraint was costing him.\\n\\n He was always so careful with me, taking the time to make sure I was soft and wet before filling me too full with his long, thick cock.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll decide when you\u0027re ready.\"\\n\\n \"I want you inside - \" The plane shook suddenly, then dropped, leaving me weightless but for the suction of Gideon\u0027s mouth.\\n\\n \"Gideon!\" I trembled through another climax, my body arching with the need to feel him in me.\\n\\n Through the roaring of blood in my ears, I heard a voice making an announcement over the comm system, but I couldn\u0027t register the words.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re so sensitive now.\"\\n\\n Lifting his head, he licked his lips.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re coming like crazy.\"\\n\\n I gasped.\\n\\n \"I\u0027d come harder if you were inside me.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll keep that in mind.\"\\n\\n \"It doesn\u0027t matter if I get a little sore now,\" I argued.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll have days to recover.\"\\n\\n Something sparked in the depths of his gaze.\\n\\n He rose up.\\n\\n \"No, Eva.\"\\n\\n My postorgasmic haze faded at the harshness of his voice.\\n\\n I levered up onto my elbows and watched him begin to strip, his moves quick and economically graceful.\\n\\n \"My choice,\" I reminded.\\n\\n In short order he removed his vest, tie, and cuff links.\\n\\n His voice was too even when he asked, \"You really want to play that card, angel?\" \"If that\u0027s what it takes.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027ll take more than that for me to hurt you deliberately.\"\\n\\n His shirt and slacks followed more slowly, a striptease that was far more seductive than mine had been.\\n\\n \"For us, pain and pleasure are mutually exclusive.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reflected-in-you-crossfire-2/page-13.html","bookId":1923,"book":{"id":1923,"title":"Reflected in You (Crossfire #2)","description":"Storyline: Reflected in You (Crossfire #2) \\n Gideon Cross.
