Is it Gideon?\" \"Come on.\"\n I gestured deeper down the hallway, toward the emergency exit.\"What\u0027s this about?\" Once we were away from the bathrooms, I told her.\n \"Remember when Gideon was a child and he told you he\u0027d been abused or violated?\" Her face paled.\n \"He told you about that?\" \"No.\n But I\u0027ve witnessed his nightmares.\n His horrible, ugly, vicious nightmares where he begs for mercy.\"\n My voice was low but throbbed with anger.\n It was all I could do not to keep my hands to myself as she stood there looking both embarrassed and militant.\n \"It was your job to protect and support him!\" Her chin went up.\n \"You don\u0027t know - \"\"You\u0027re not to blame for what happened before you knew.\"\n I got in her face, felt satisfaction when she took a step back.\n \"But anything that happened after he told you is entirely your fault.\"\n \"Fuck you,\" she spat at me.\n \"You have no idea what you\u0027re talking about.\n How dare you come up to me like this and say these things to me when you\u0027re clueless!\" \"Yeah, I dare.\n Your son is seriously damaged by what happened to him, and your refusal to believe him made it a million times worse.\"\n \"You think I would tolerate the abuse of my own child?\" Her face was flushed with anger and her eyes too bright.\n \"I had Gideon examined by two separate pediatricians to look for .\n trauma.\n I did everything I could be expected to do.\"\n \"Except believe him.\n Which is what you should\u0027ve done as his mother.\"\n \"I\u0027m Christopher\u0027s mother, too, and he was there.\n He swears nothing happened.\n Who was I supposed to believe when there was no proof? No one could find anything to support Gideon\u0027s claims.\"\n \"He shouldn\u0027t have had to provide proof.\n He was a child!\" The anger I felt was vibrating through me.\n My fists were clenched against the urge to hit her.\n Not just for what Gideon had lost, but for what we\u0027d lost together.\n \"You were supposed to take his side no matter what.\"\n \"Gideon was a troubled boy, struggling through therapy over his father\u0027s death, and desperate for attention.\n You don\u0027t know what he was like then.\"\n \"I know what he\u0027s like now.\n He\u0027s broken and hurting and doesn\u0027t think he\u0027s worth loving.\n And you helped make him that way.\"\n \"Go to hell.\"\n She stormed off.\n \"I\u0027m already there,\" I shouted after her.\n \"And so is your son.\"\n I spent all day Sunday being Old Eva.\n Trey had the day off and took Cary out for brunch and a movie.\n I was pleased to see them together, thrilled that they were both trying.\n Cary hadn\u0027t invited over any of the people who called his cell, and I wondered if he was rethinking his friendships.\n I suspected many were of the fair- weather variety - great fun but no substance.\n Having the entire apartment to myself, I slept too much, ate crappy food, and never bothered to change out of my pajamas.\n I cried over Gideon in the privacy of my room, staring at the collage of photos that used to be on my desk at work.\n I missed the weight of his ring on my finger and the sound of his voice.\n I missed the feel of his hands and lips on me and the tenderly possessive way he took care of me.\n When Monday came around, I left the apartment as New Eva.\n With smoky eyes, pink lips, and my new bouncy layered cut, I felt like I could pretend to be someone else for the day.\n Someone who wasn\u0027t heartbroken and lost and angry.\n I saw the Bentley when I stepped outside, but Angus didn\u0027t bother to exit the car, knowing I wouldn\u0027t accept a ride.\n It puzzled me that Gideon would have him wasting his time hanging around, just in case I might have him drive me somewhere.\n It didn\u0027t make any sense unless Gideon was feeling guilty.\n I hated guilt, hated that it afflicted so many of the people in my life.\n I wish they\u0027d just drop it and move on.\n Like I was trying to do.\n The morning at Waters Field \u0026 Leaman went by swiftly, because I had Will, the new assistant, to help out as well as my regular work to do.\n I was glad that he wasn\u0027t afraid to ask lots of questions, because he kept me too busy to count the seconds, minutes, and hours since the last time I\u0027d seen Gideon.\n \"You look good, Eva,\" Mark said when I first joined him in his office.\n \"Are you doing all right?\" \"Not really.\n But I\u0027ll get there.\"\n He leaned forward, setting his elbows on his desk.\n \"Steven and I broke up once, about a year and a half into our relationship.\n We\u0027d had a rough couple weeks and decided it\u0027d be easier to let it go.\n It was fucking awful,\" he said vehemently.\n \"I hated every minute of it.\n Getting up every morning was a monumental feat and he was in the same shape.\n So anyway .\n if you need anything .\n \" \"Thank you.\n The best thing you can do for me right now is keep me busy.\n I just don\u0027t want any time to think about anything but work.\"\n \"I can do that.\"\n When lunch came around, Will and I grabbed Megumi and we headed to a nearby pizza place.\n Megumi filled me in on her growing relationship with her blind date, and Will told us about his adventures at Ikea as he and his girlfriend worked on filling their loft apartment with do-it-yourself furniture.\n I was glad I had my spa day to talk about.\n \"We\u0027re heading to the Hamptons this weekend,\" Megumi said as we returned to the Crossfire.\n \"My guy\u0027s grandparents have a place out there.\n How cool is that?\" \"Very.\"\n I passed through the turnstiles beside her.\n \"I\u0027m jealous you\u0027ll be able to get away from the heat.\"\n \"I know, right?\" \"Better than furniture assembly,\" Will muttered, following a group of people onto one of the elevators.\n \"I can\u0027t wait \u0027til we\u0027re done.\"\n The doors started to close, and then they slid open again.\n Gideon stepped into the car after us.\n The familiar, palpable energy that always coursed between us hit me hard.\n Awareness rippled down my spine and flared outward, sending goose bumps racing across my skin. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reflected-in-you-crossfire-2/page-51.html","bookId":1923,"book":{"id":1923,"title":"Reflected in You (Crossfire #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Reflected in You (Crossfire #2) \n Gideon Cross.
