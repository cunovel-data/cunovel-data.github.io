I know he was there to see Gideon. I know it. Nathan wouldn\u0027t go there to see me. Not a place like that with all the security and people I know around.\" He sat back. \"Okay. So what does that mean?\" \"It means Gideon was fine after Nathan.\" I threw up my hands. \"He was fine that whole week. He was more than fine that weekend we took off together. He was fine Monday morning after we got back. Then - bam - he lost his fucking mind and went crazy on me Monday night.\" \"I\u0027m following.\" \"So what happened on Monday?\" Cary\u0027s brows rose. \"You\u0027re asking me?\" \"Grr.\" I grabbed my hair in my hands. \"I\u0027m asking the fucking universe. God. Anyone. What the hell happened to my boyfriend?\" \"I thought we agreed you need to ask him.\" \"I get two answers from him: Trust me and wait. He gave my ring back today.\" I showed him my hand. \"And he\u0027s still wearing the one I gave him. Do you have any idea how confusing that is? They\u0027re not just rings, they\u0027re promises. They\u0027re symbols of ownership and commitment. Why would he still wear his? Why is it so important to him that I wear mine? Does he seriously expect me to wait while he screws Corinne out of his system?\" \"Is that what you think he\u0027s doing? Really?\" Closing my eyes, I let my head fall back. \"No. And I can\u0027t decide if that makes me na?ve or willfully delusional.\" \"Does this Dr. Lucas guy have anything to do with this?\" \"No.\" I straightened and joined him on the couch. \"Did you find anything?\" \"Kind of hard, baby girl, when I don\u0027t know what I\u0027m looking for.\" \"It\u0027s just a hunch.\" I looked at his screen. \"What\u0027s that?\" \"A transcript of an interview with Brett that was done yesterday on a Florida radio station.\" \"Oh? What are you reading that for?\"\"I was listening to \u0027Golden\u0027 and decided to run a search on it, and this came up.\" I tried reading, but my angle was bad. \"What\u0027s it say?\" \"He was asked if there\u0027s really an Eva out there and he said yes, there is, and he recently reconnected with her and hopes to make it work out a second time.\" \"What? No way!\" \"Yes way.\" Cary grinned. \"So you\u0027ve got your rebound man lined up if Cross doesn\u0027t get his shit together.\" I pushed to my feet. \"Whatever. I\u0027m hungry. Want something?\" \"If your appetite\u0027s back, that\u0027s a good sign.\" \"Everything\u0027s coming back,\" I told him. \"With a vengeance.\" I was waiting at the curb for Angus the next morning. He pulled up and Paul, the doorman for my apartment building, opened the back door for me. \"Good morning, Angus,\" I greeted him.\"Good morning, Miss Tramell.\" His gaze met mine in the rearview mirror, and he smiled. As he started to pull away, I leaned forward between the two front seats. \"Do you know where Corinne Giroux lives?\" He glanced at me. \"Yes.\" I sat back. \"That\u0027s where I want to go.\" Corinne lived around the corner from Gideon. I was certain that wasn\u0027t a coincidence. I checked in with the front desk and waited twenty minutes before I was given permission to go up to the tenth floor. I rang the bell to her apartment and the door swung open to reveal a flushed and disheveled Corinne in a floor-length black silk robe. She was seriously gorgeous, with her silky black hair and eyes like aquamarines, and she moved with a lithe grace I admired. I\u0027d armored up in my favorite gray sleeveless dress and was very glad I had. She made me feel downright homely. \"Eva,\" she said breathlessly. \"What a surprise.\" \"I\u0027m sorry to barge in uninvited. I just need to ask you something real quick.\" \"Oh?\" She kept the door partially closed and leaned into the jamb. \"Can I come in?\" I asked tightly. \"Uh.\" She glanced over her shoulder. \"It\u0027s best if you didn\u0027t.\" \"It doesn\u0027t bother me if you have company and I promise, this won\u0027t take but a minute.\" \"Eva.\" She licked her lips. \"How do I say this . ?\" My hands were shaking and my stomach was a quivering mess, my brain taunting me with images of Gideon standing naked behind her, their early-morning fuck interrupted by the ex-girlfriend who wouldn\u0027t get a clue. I knew how well he liked sex in the morning. But then I knew him well, period. Knew him enough to say, \"Cut the shit, Corinne.\" Her eyes widened. My mouth curved derisively. \"Gideon\u0027s in love with me. He\u0027s not fucking around with you.\" She recovered quickly. \"He\u0027s not fucking around with you, either. I would know, since he\u0027s spending all of his free time with me.\" Fine. We\u0027d talk about this in the hallway. \"I know him. I don\u0027t always understand him, but that\u0027s a different story. I know he would\u0027ve told you upfront that you and he weren\u0027t going anywhere, because he wouldn\u0027t want to lead you on. He hurt you before; he won\u0027t do it again.\" \"This is all very fascinating. Does he know you\u0027re here?\" \"No, but you\u0027ll tell him. And that\u0027s fine. I just want to know what you were doing at the Crossfire that day you came out looking as freshly fucked as you do now.\" Her smile was razor sharp. \"What do you think I was doing?\" \"Not Gideon,\" I said decisively, even though I was silently praying that I wasn\u0027t making a total idiot out of myself. \"You saw me, didn\u0027t you? From the lobby, you had a direct view across the street and you saw me coming. Gideon told you at the Waldorf dinner that I was the jealous type. Did you have a nooner with someone from one of the other offices? Or did you muss yourself up before you stepped outside?\" I saw the answer on her face. It was lightning quick, there and gone, but I saw it. \"Both of those suggestions are absurd,\" she said. I nodded, savoring a moment of profound relief and satisfaction. \"Listen. You\u0027re never going to have him the way you want. And I know how that hurts. I\u0027ve been living it the past two weeks. I\u0027m sorry for you, I really am.\" \"Fuck you and your pity,\" she snapped. \"Save it for yourself. I\u0027m the one he\u0027s spending time with.\" \"And there\u0027s your saving grace, Corinne. If you\u0027re paying attention, you know he\u0027s hurting right now. Be his friend.\" I headed back to the elevators and called over my shoulder, \"Have a nice day.\" She slammed her door shut behind me.When I got back to the Bentley, I told Angus to take me to Dr. Terrence Lucas\u0027s office. He paused in the act of closing the door and stared down at me. \"Gideon will be very angry, Eva.\" I nodded, understanding the warning. \"I\u0027ll deal with it when the time comes.\" The building that housed Dr. Lucas\u0027s private practice was unassuming, but his offices were warm and inviting. The waiting room was paneled in dark wood and the walls covered in a mixture of pictures of infants and children. Parenting magazines covered the tables and were neatly stored in racks, while the dedicated play area was tidy and supervised. I signed in and took a seat, but I\u0027d barely sat when I was called back by the nurse. I was taken to Dr. Lucas\u0027s office, not an exam room, and he rose from his chair when I entered, rounding the desk quickly. \"Eva.\" He held out his hand and I shook it. \"You didn\u0027t have to make an appointment.\" I managed a smile. \"I didn\u0027t know how else to reach you.\" \"Have a seat.\" I sat, but he remained standing, choosing to lean back against the desk and grip the edges with both hands. It was a power position, and I wondered why he felt the need to use it with me. \"What can I do for you?\" he asked. He had a calm, confident air and a wide, open smile. With his good looks and affable manner, I was sure any mother would have confidence in his skill and integrity. \"Gideon Cross was a patient of yours, wasn\u0027t he?\" His face closed instantly and he straightened. \"I\u0027m not at liberty to discuss my patients.\" \"When you gave me that \u0027not at liberty to discuss\u0027 line at the hospital, I didn\u0027t put it together, and I should have.\" My fingertips drummed into the armrest. \"You lied to his mother. Why?\" He returned to the other side of his desk, putting the furniture between us. \"Did he tell you that?\" \"No. I\u0027m figuring this out as I go. Hypothetically speaking, why would you lie about the results of an exam?\" \"I wouldn\u0027t. You need to leave.\" \"Oh, come on.\" I sat back and crossed my legs. \"I expect more from you. Where are the assertions that Gideon is a soulless monster bent on corrupting the women of the world?\" \"I\u0027ve done my due diligence and warned you.\" His gaze was hard, his lip curled in a sneer.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reflected-in-you-crossfire-2/page-53.html","bookId":1923,"book":{"id":1923,"title":"Reflected in You (Crossfire #2)","description":"Storyline: Reflected in You (Crossfire #2) Gideon Cross.
