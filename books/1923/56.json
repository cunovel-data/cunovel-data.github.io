You want to exchange notes?\" \"Sure.\\n\\n Why not?\" By the time lunch was over, I\u0027d gotten a pretty good idea of what fueled Christopher\u0027s hatred.\\n\\n All he cared about was the man he saw in the mirror.\\n\\n Gideon was more handsome, richer, more powerful, more confident .\\n\\n just more.\\n\\n And Christopher was obviously being eaten alive by jealousy.\\n\\n His memories of Gideon were colored by the belief that Gideon had received all the attention as a child.\\n\\n Which might have been true, considering how troubled he was.\\n\\n Worse, the sibling rivalry had crossed over into their professional lives when Cross Industries acquired majority shares in Vidal Records.\\n\\n I made a mental note to ask Gideon why he\u0027d done that.\\n\\n We stopped outside the Crossfire to part ways.\\n\\n A taxi racing through a huge puddle sent a plume of foaming water right at me.\\n\\n Swearing under my breath, I dodged the spray and almost stumbled into Christopher.\\n\\n \"I\u0027d like to take you out sometime, Eva.\\n\\n Dinner, perhaps?\" \"I\u0027ll get in touch,\" I hedged.\\n\\n \"My roommate\u0027s really sick right now and I need to be around for him as much as possible.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ve got my number.\"\\n\\n He smiled and kissed the back of my hand, a gesture I\u0027m sure he thought was charming.\\n\\n \"And I\u0027ll keep in touch.\"\\n\\n I made my way through the Crossfire\u0027s revolving doors and headed for the turnstiles.\\n\\n One of the black-suited security guards at the desk stopped me.\\n\\n \"Miss Tramell.\"\\n\\n He smiled.\\n\\n \"Could you come with me, please?\" Curious, I followed him to the security office where I\u0027d originally gotten my employee badge when I was hired.\\n\\n He opened the door for me, and Gideon was waiting inside.\\n\\n Leaning back against the desk with his arms crossed, he looked beautiful and fuckable and wryly amused.\\n\\n The door shut behind me and he sighed, shaking his head.\\n\\n \"Are there other people in my life you plan on harassing on my behalf?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"Are you spying on me again?\" \"Keeping a protective eye on you.\"\\n\\n I arched a brow at him.\\n\\n \"And how do you know if I harassed him or not?\" His faint smile widened.\\n\\n \"Because I know you.\"\\n\\n \"Well, I didn\u0027t harass him.\\n\\n Really.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t,\" I argued when he shot me a look of disbelief.\\n\\n \"I was going to, but then I didn\u0027t.\\n\\n And why are we in this room?\" \"Are you on some kind of crusade, angel?\" We were talking around each other, and I wasn\u0027t sure why.\\n\\n And I didn\u0027t care, because something else struck me as more significant.\\n\\n \"Do you realize that your reaction to my lunch with Christopher is very calm? And so is my reaction to your spending time with Corinne? We\u0027re both reacting totally different from the way we would have just a month ago.\"\\n\\n He was different.\\n\\n He smiled, and there was something unique about that warm curving of his lips.\\n\\n \"We trust each other, Eva.\\n\\n It feels good, doesn\u0027t it?\"\"Trusting you doesn\u0027t mean I\u0027m any less baffled by what\u0027s going on between us.\\n\\n Why are we hiding in this office?\" \"Plausible deniability.\"\\n\\n Gideon straightened and came to me.\\n\\n Cupping my face in his hands, he tilted my head back and kissed me sweetly.\\n\\n \"I love you.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re getting good at saying that.\"\\n\\n He ran his fingers through my new bangs.\\n\\n \"Remember that night, when you had your nightmare and I was out late? You wondered where I was.\"\\n\\n \"I still wonder.\"\\n\\n \"I was at the hotel, clearing out that room.\\n\\n My fuck pad, as you called it.\\n\\n Explaining that while you were puking your guts out didn\u0027t seem to be the appropriate time.\"\\n\\n My breath left me in a rush.\\n\\n It was a relief to know where he\u0027d been.\\n\\n An even bigger relief to know that the fuck pad was no more.\\n\\n His gaze was soft as he looked at me.\\n\\n \"I\u0027d completely forgotten about it until it came up with Dr.\\n\\n Petersen.\\n\\n We both know I\u0027ll never use it again.\\n\\n My girl prefers modes of transportation to beds.\"\\n\\n He smiled and walked out.\\n\\n I stared after him.\\n\\n The security guard filled the open doorway and I shoved aside my roiling thoughts to examine later, when I had the time to really grasp where they were leading me.\\n\\n On the walk home, I picked up a bottle of sparkling apple juice in lieu of champagne.\\n\\n I saw the Bentley every now and then, following along, ever ready to pull over and pick me up.\\n\\n It used to irritate me, because the lingering connection it represented deepened my confusion over my breakup with Gideon.\\n\\n Now, the sight of it made me smile.\\n\\n Dr.\\n\\n Petersen had been right.\\n\\n Abstinence and some space had cleared my head.\\n\\n Somehow, the distance between me and Gideon had made us stronger, made us appreciate each other more and take less for granted.\\n\\n I loved him more now than I ever had, and I felt that way while I was planning on a night just hanging out with my roommate, having no idea where Gideon was or who he might be with.\\n\\n It didn\u0027t matter.\\n\\n I knew I was in his thoughts, in his heart.\\n\\n My phone rang and I pulled it out of my purse.\\n\\n Seeing my mother\u0027s name on the screen, I answered with, \"Hi, Mom.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t understand what they\u0027re looking for!\" she complained, sounding angry and tearful.\\n\\n \"They won\u0027t leave Richard alone.\\n\\n They went to his offices today and took copies of the security tapes.\"\\n\\n \"The detectives?\" \"Yes.\\n\\n They\u0027re relentless.\\n\\n What do they want?\" I turned the corner to reach my street.\\n\\n \"To catch a killer.\\n\\n They probably just want to see Nathan coming and going.\\n\\n Check the timing or something.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s ridiculous!\" \"Yeah, it\u0027s also just a guess.\\n\\n Don\u0027t worry.\\n\\n There\u0027s nothing to find because Stanton\u0027s innocent.\\n\\n Everything will be okay.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s been so good about this, Eva,\" she said softly.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s so good to me.\"\\n\\n I sighed, hearing the pleading note in her voice.\\n\\n \"I know, Mom.\\n\\n I get it.\\n\\n Dad gets it.\\n\\n You\u0027re where you should be.\\n\\n No one\u0027s judging you.\\n\\n We\u0027re all good.\"\\n\\n It took me until I reached my front door to calm her down, during which time I wondered what the detectives would see if they pulled the Crossfire security tapes, too.\\n\\n The history of my relationship with Gideon could be chronicled through the times I\u0027d been in the Cross Industries vestibule with him.\\n\\n He\u0027d first propositioned me there, bluntly stating his desire.\\n\\n He\u0027d pinned me to the wall there, right after I\u0027d agreed to date him exclusively.\\n\\n And he\u0027d rejected my touch that horrible day when he had first started pulling away from me.\\n\\n The detectives would see it all if they looked back far enough, those private and personal moments in time.\\n\\n \"Call me if you need me,\" I said as I dropped my bag and purse off at the breakfast bar.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll be home all night.\"\\n\\n We hung up, and I noticed an unfamiliar trench coat slung over one of the bar stools.\\n\\n I shouted out to Cary, \"Honey, I\u0027m home!\" I put the bottle of apple juice in the fridge and headed down the hallway to my bedroom for a shower.\\n\\n I was on the threshold of my room when Cary\u0027s door opened and Tatiana came out.\\n\\n My eyes widened at the sight of her naughty nurse costume, complete with exposed garters and fishnets.\\n\\n \"Hey, honey,\" she said, looking smug.\\n\\n She was astonishingly tall in her heels, towering over me.\\n\\n A successful model, Tatiana Cherlin had the kind of face and body that could stop traffic.\\n\\n \"Take care of him for me.\"\\n\\n Blinking, I watched the leggy blonde disappear into the living room.\\n\\n I heard the front door shut a short time later.Cary appeared in his doorway, looking mussed and flushed and wearing only his boxer briefs.\\n\\n He leaned into the doorway with a lazy, satisfied grin.\\n\\n \"Hey.\"\\n\\n \"Hey, yourself.\\n\\n Looks like you had a good day.\"\\n\\n \"Hell yeah.\"\\n\\n That made me smile.\\n\\n \"No judgment here, but I assumed you and Tatiana were done.\"\\n\\n \"I never thought we got started.\"\\n\\n He ran a hand through his hair, ruffling it.\\n\\n \"Then she showed up today all worried and apologetic.\\n\\n She\u0027s been in Prague and didn\u0027t hear about me until this morning.\\n\\n She rushed over wearing that, like she read my perverted mind.\"\\n\\n I leaned into my doorway, too.\\n\\n \"Guess she knows you.\"\\n\\n \"Guess she does.\"\\n\\n He shrugged.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll see how it goes.\\n\\n She knows Trey\u0027s in my life and I hope to keep him there.\\n\\n Trey, though .\\n\\n I know he won\u0027t like it.\"\\n\\n I felt for both men.\\n\\n It was going to take a lot of compromising for their relationship to work out.\\n\\n \"How about we forget about our significant others for a night and have an action movie marathon? I brought some nonalcoholic champagne home.\"\\n\\n His brows rose.\\n\\n \"Where\u0027s the fun in that?\" \"Can\u0027t mix your meds with booze, you know,\" I said dryly.\\n\\n \"No Krav Maga for you tonight?\" \"I\u0027ll make it up tomorrow.\\n\\n I feel like chilling with you.\\n\\n I want to sprawl on the couch, and eat pizza with chopsticks and Chinese food with my fingers.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re a rebel, baby girl.\"\\n\\n He grinned.\\n\\n \"And you\u0027ve got yourself a date.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reflected-in-you-crossfire-2/page-56.html","bookId":1923,"book":{"id":1923,"title":"Reflected in You (Crossfire #2)","description":"Storyline: Reflected in You (Crossfire #2) \\n Gideon Cross.
