There is no end, Eva.\"\\n\\n He flattened me into the side of the car.\\n\\n I was pinned by six feet, two inches of violently aroused male.\\n\\n \"I miss you,\" I whispered, grabbing his ass and urging him harder against me.Gideon groaned.\\n\\n \"Angel.\"\\n\\n He was kissing me: deep, shamelessly desperate kisses that made my toes curl in my pumps.\\n\\n \"What are you doing?\" he breathed.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re going around, stirring up everything.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve got time on my hands,\" I shot back, just as breathless, \"since I dumped my asshat boyfriend.\"\\n\\n He growled, fiercely passionate, his hand in my hair pulling so tightly it pained me.\\n\\n \"You can\u0027t make this up with a kiss or a fuck, Gideon.\\n\\n Not this time.\"\\n\\n It was so hard to let him go; nearly impossible after the weeks I\u0027d been denied the right and opportunity to touch him.\\n\\n I needed him.\\n\\n His forehead pressed to mine.\\n\\n \"You have to trust me.\"\\n\\n I put my hands on his chest and shoved him back.\\n\\n He let me, his gaze searching my face.\\n\\n \"Not when you don\u0027t talk to me.\"\\n\\n I reached over, pulled the key from the control panel, and held it out to him.\\n\\n The car began its descent.\\n\\n \"You put me through hell.\\n\\n On purpose.\\n\\n Made me suffer.\\n\\n And there\u0027s no end in sight.\\n\\n I don\u0027t know what the fuck you\u0027re doing, ace, but this Dr.\\n\\n Jekyll and Mr.\\n\\n Hyde shit ain\u0027t cutting it with me.\"\\n\\n His hand went into his pocket, his movements leisurely and controlled, which was when he was at his most dangerous.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re completely unmanageable.\"\\n\\n \"When I\u0027ve got clothes on.\\n\\n Get used to it.\"\\n\\n The car doors opened and I stepped out.\\n\\n His hand went to the small of my back, and a shiver moved through me.\\n\\n That innocuous touch, through layers of material, had been inciting lust in me from the very first.\\n\\n \"You put your hand on Corinne\u0027s back like this again, and I\u0027m breaking your fingers.\"\\n\\n \"You know I don\u0027t want anyone else,\" he murmured.\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t.\\n\\n I\u0027m consumed with wanting you.\"\\n\\n Both the Bentley and the Mercedes were waiting at the curb.\\n\\n The sky had darkened while I\u0027d been inside, as if it were brooding along with the man beside me.\\n\\n There was a weighted expectation in the air, an early sign of a gathering summer storm.\\n\\n I stopped beneath the entrance overhang and looked at Gideon.\\n\\n \"Make them ride together.\\n\\n You and I need to talk.\"\\n\\n \"That was the plan.\"\\n\\n Angus touched the brim of his hat and slid behind the wheel.\\n\\n The other driver walked up to Gideon and handed him a set of keys.\\n\\n \"Miss Tramell,\" he said, by way of greeting.\\n\\n \"Eva, this is Raul.\"\\n\\n \"We meet again,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Did you pass on my message last time?\" Gideon\u0027s fingers flexed against my back.\\n\\n \"He did.\"\\n\\n I beamed.\\n\\n \"Thank you, Raul.\"\\n\\n Raul went around to the front passenger side of the Bentley, while Gideon escorted me to the Mercedes and opened the door for me.\\n\\n I felt a little thrill as he got behind the wheel and adjusted the seat to accommodate his long legs.\\n\\n He started the engine and merged into traffic, expertly and confidently navigating the powerful car through the craziness of New York city streets.\\n\\n \"Watching you drive makes me want you,\" I told him, noting how his easy grip on the wheel tightened.\\n\\n \"Christ.\"\\n\\n He glanced at me.\\n\\n \"You have a transportation fetish.\"\\n\\n \"I have a Gideon fetish.\"\\n\\n My voice lowered.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s been weeks.\"\\n\\n \"And I hate every second of it.\\n\\n This is torment for me, Eva.\\n\\n I can\u0027t focus.\\n\\n I can\u0027t sleep.\\n\\n I lose my temper at the slightest irritants.\\n\\n I\u0027m in hell without you.\"\\n\\n I never wanted him to suffer, but I\u0027d be lying if I said it didn\u0027t make my own misery better knowing he was missing me as much as I was missing him.I twisted in my seat to face him.\\n\\n \"Why are you doing this to us?\" \"I had an opportunity and I took it.\"\\n\\n His jaw firmed.\\n\\n \"This separation is the price.\\n\\n It won\u0027t last forever.\\n\\n I need you to be patient.\"\\n\\n I shook my head.\\n\\n \"No, Gideon.\\n\\n I can\u0027t.\\n\\n Not anymore.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re not leaving me.\\n\\n I won\u0027t let you.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve already left.\\n\\n Don\u0027t you see that?
