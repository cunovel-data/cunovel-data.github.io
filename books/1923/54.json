I just needed to see your face. I had to know if I was right.\" \"You\u0027re not. Cross was never a patient of mine.\" \"Semantics - his mother consulted you. And while you go about your days seething over the fact that your wife fell in love with him, think about what you did to a small child who needed help.\" My voice took on an edge as anger surged. I couldn\u0027t think about what had happened to Gideon without wanting to do serious violence to anyone who contributed to his pain. I uncrossed my legs and stood. \"What happened between him and your wife happened between two consenting adults. What happened to him as a child was a crime and how you contributed to that is a travesty.\" \"Get out.\" \"My pleasure.\" I yanked the door open and nearly ran into Gideon, who\u0027d been leaning against the wall just outside the office. His hand encircled my upper arm, but his gaze was on Dr. Lucas, icy with fury and hatred. \"Stay away from her,\" he said harshly. Lucas\u0027s smile was filled with malice. \"She came to me.\" Gideon\u0027s returning smile made me shiver. \"You see her coming, I suggest you run in the opposite direction.\" \"Funny. That\u0027s the advice I gave her in regard to you.\" I flipped the good doctor the bird. Snorting, Gideon caught my hand and pulled me back down the hall. \"What is it with you and giving people the finger?\" \"What? It\u0027s a classic.\" \"You can\u0027t just barge in here!\" the receptionist snapped as we passed the counter. He glanced at her. \"You can cancel that call to security, we\u0027re leaving.\" We exited out to the corridor. \"Did Angus tattle on me?\" I muttered, trying to pry my arm free. \"No. Stop wriggling. All the cars have GPS tracking.\" \"You\u0027re a nut job. You know that?\" He stabbed the elevator button and glared at me. \"I am? What about you? You\u0027re all over the place. My mother. Corinne. Goddamned Lucas. What the fuck are you doing, Eva?\" \"It\u0027s none of your business.\" I lifted my chin. \"We broke up, remember?\" His jaw tightened. He stood there in his suit, looking so polished and urbane, while radiating a wild, feverish energy. The contrast between what I saw when I looked at him and what I felt goaded my hunger. I loved that I got to have the man inside the suit. Every delicious, untameable inch of him. The car arrived and we stepped inside. Excitement sizzled through me. He\u0027d come after me. That made me so hot. He shoved an elevator key into the control panel and I groaned. \"Is there anything you don\u0027t own in New York?\" He was on me in an instant, one hand in my hair and the other on my ass, his mouth on mine in a violent kiss. He wasted no time, his tongue thrusting between my lips, plunging deep and hard. I moaned and gripped his waist, pushing onto my tiptoes to deepen the contact. His teeth sank into my lower lip with enough force to hurt. \"You think you can say a few words and end us? There is no end, Eva.\" He flattened me into the side of the car. I was pinned by six feet, two inches of violently aroused male. \"I miss you,\" I whispered, grabbing his ass and urging him harder against me.Gideon groaned. \"Angel.\" He was kissing me: deep, shamelessly desperate kisses that made my toes curl in my pumps. \"What are you doing?\" he breathed. \"You\u0027re going around, stirring up everything.\" \"I\u0027ve got time on my hands,\" I shot back, just as breathless, \"since I dumped my asshat boyfriend.\" He growled, fiercely passionate, his hand in my hair pulling so tightly it pained me. \"You can\u0027t make this up with a kiss or a fuck, Gideon. Not this time.\" It was so hard to let him go; nearly impossible after the weeks I\u0027d been denied the right and opportunity to touch him. I needed him. His forehead pressed to mine. \"You have to trust me.\" I put my hands on his chest and shoved him back. He let me, his gaze searching my face. \"Not when you don\u0027t talk to me.\" I reached over, pulled the key from the control panel, and held it out to him. The car began its descent. \"You put me through hell. On purpose. Made me suffer. And there\u0027s no end in sight. I don\u0027t know what the fuck you\u0027re doing, ace, but this Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde shit ain\u0027t cutting it with me.\" His hand went into his pocket, his movements leisurely and controlled, which was when he was at his most dangerous. \"You\u0027re completely unmanageable.\" \"When I\u0027ve got clothes on. Get used to it.\" The car doors opened and I stepped out. His hand went to the small of my back, and a shiver moved through me. That innocuous touch, through layers of material, had been inciting lust in me from the very first. \"You put your hand on Corinne\u0027s back like this again, and I\u0027m breaking your fingers.\" \"You know I don\u0027t want anyone else,\" he murmured. \"I can\u0027t. I\u0027m consumed with wanting you.\" Both the Bentley and the Mercedes were waiting at the curb. The sky had darkened while I\u0027d been inside, as if it were brooding along with the man beside me. There was a weighted expectation in the air, an early sign of a gathering summer storm. I stopped beneath the entrance overhang and looked at Gideon. \"Make them ride together. You and I need to talk.\" \"That was the plan.\" Angus touched the brim of his hat and slid behind the wheel. The other driver walked up to Gideon and handed him a set of keys. \"Miss Tramell,\" he said, by way of greeting. \"Eva, this is Raul.\" \"We meet again,\" I said. \"Did you pass on my message last time?\" Gideon\u0027s fingers flexed against my back. \"He did.\" I beamed. \"Thank you, Raul.\" Raul went around to the front passenger side of the Bentley, while Gideon escorted me to the Mercedes and opened the door for me. I felt a little thrill as he got behind the wheel and adjusted the seat to accommodate his long legs. He started the engine and merged into traffic, expertly and confidently navigating the powerful car through the craziness of New York city streets. \"Watching you drive makes me want you,\" I told him, noting how his easy grip on the wheel tightened. \"Christ.\" He glanced at me. \"You have a transportation fetish.\" \"I have a Gideon fetish.\" My voice lowered. \"It\u0027s been weeks.\" \"And I hate every second of it. This is torment for me, Eva. I can\u0027t focus. I can\u0027t sleep. I lose my temper at the slightest irritants. I\u0027m in hell without you.\" I never wanted him to suffer, but I\u0027d be lying if I said it didn\u0027t make my own misery better knowing he was missing me as much as I was missing him.I twisted in my seat to face him. \"Why are you doing this to us?\" \"I had an opportunity and I took it.\" His jaw firmed. \"This separation is the price. It won\u0027t last forever. I need you to be patient.\" I shook my head. \"No, Gideon. I can\u0027t. Not anymore.\" \"You\u0027re not leaving me. I won\u0027t let you.\" \"I\u0027ve already left. Don\u0027t you see that? I\u0027m living my life and you\u0027re not in it.\" \"I\u0027m in it every way I can be right now.\" \"By having Angus following me around? Come on. That\u0027s not a relationship.\" I leaned my cheek against the seat. \"Not one I want anyway.\" \"Eva.\" He exhaled harshly. \"My silence is the lesser of two evils. I feel like whether I explain or not, I\u0027ll drive you away, but explaining carries the greatest risk. You think you want to know, but if I tell you, you\u0027ll regret it. Trust me when I say there are some aspects of me you don\u0027t want to see.\" \"You have to give me something to work with.\" I set my hand on his thigh and felt the muscle bunch, then twitch in response to my touch. \"I\u0027ve got nothing right now. I\u0027m empty.\" He set his hand over mine. \"You trust me. Despite what you see to the contrary, you\u0027ve come to trust in what you know. That\u0027s huge, Eva. For both of us. For us, period.\" \"There is no us.\" \"Stop saying that.\" \"You wanted my blind trust and you have it, but that\u0027s all I can give you. You\u0027ve shared so little of yourself and I\u0027ve lived with it because I had you. And now I don\u0027t - \" \"You have me,\" he protested. \"Not the way I need you.\" I lifted one shoulder in an awkward shrug. \"You\u0027ve given me your body and I\u0027ve been greedy with it, because that\u0027s the only way you\u0027re really open to me. And now I don\u0027t have that, and when I look at what I do have, it\u0027s just promises. It\u0027s not enough for me. In the absence of you, all I have are a pile of things you won\u0027t tell me.\" He stared straight ahead, his profile rigid.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reflected-in-you-crossfire-2/page-54.html","bookId":1923,"book":{"id":1923,"title":"Reflected in You (Crossfire #2)","description":"Storyline: Reflected in You (Crossfire #2) Gideon Cross.
