{"id":63464,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"\"With all the secrets he\u0027s got, can you be sure you know him well enough to make that judgment call?\" I thought of the man who\u0027d spent the night with me and felt relief at how sure I was about my answer - at least at that moment. \"Yes.\" \"All right, then.\" Cary shrugged. \"I talked to Dr. Travis yesterday.\" My thoughts immediately veered in another direction at the mention of our therapist in San Diego. \"You did?\" \"Yeah. I really fucked up the other night.\" From the agitated way he scooped his long bangs back from his face, I knew he was referring to the orgy I\u0027d walked in on. \"Cross broke Ian\u0027s nose and split his lip,\" he said, reminding me of how violently Gideon had responded to Cary\u0027s . friend rudely propositioning me to join them. \"I saw Ian yesterday and he looks like he was hit in the face with a brick. He was asking who clocked him, so he could press charges.\" \"Oh.\" My lungs seized for the length of two heartbeats. \"Oh, crap.\" \"I know. Billionaire plus lawsuit equals beaucoup bucks. What the fuck was I thinking?\" Cary closed his eyes and rubbed them. \"I told him I didn\u0027t know who your date was, that it was some guy you picked up and dragged home. Cross blindsided him, so Ian didn\u0027t see shit.\" \"The two girls with you got a real good look at Gideon,\" I said grimly. \"They took off out that door\" - Cary pointed across the living room as if our door were still reverberating with the slam - \"like she-bats out of hell. They didn\u0027t go to the urgent care with us, and neither of us knows who they are. If Ian doesn\u0027t run into them again, we\u0027re okay.\" I rubbed at the quiver in my tummy, feeling unsettled again. \"I\u0027ll keep an eye on the situation,\" he assured me. \"The whole night was a major wake-up call, and talking it out in therapy gave me some perspective. Afterward, I went to see Trey. To apologize.\" Hearing Trey\u0027s name made me sad. I\u0027d hoped Cary\u0027s budding relationship with the veterinary student would work out, but Cary had sabotaged that. As usual. \"How\u0027d that go?\" He shrugged again, but the movement was awkward. \"I hurt him the other night because I\u0027m an asshole. Then I hurt him again yesterday trying to do the right thing.\" \"Did you break it off?\" I held my hand out to him and squeezed his when he placed it in mine. \"It\u0027s seriously cooled off. Like on ice. He wants me to be gay, and I\u0027m not.\" It was painful to hear that someone wanted Cary to be anything other than who he was, because it\u0027d always been that way for him. I couldn\u0027t understand why. To me, he was wonderful as is. \"I\u0027m so sorry, Cary.\" \"So am I, because he\u0027s a great guy. I\u0027m just not ready for the stress and demands of a complicated relationship right now. I\u0027m working a lot. I\u0027m not stable enough yet to be fucked up in the head.\" His lips pursed. \"You might want to think about that, too. We just moved out here. We\u0027ve both still got some settling in to do.\" I nodded, understanding where he was coming from and not disagreeing, but unwavering in my decision to see my relationship with Gideon through. \"Did you talk to Tatiana, too?\" \"No need.\" His thumb brushed over my knuckles before he released me. \"She\u0027s easy.\" Snorting, I took a large gulp of my cooling coffee. \"Not just that way,\" he chided, giving me a wicked grin. \"I mean she doesn\u0027t expect anything or make any demands. As long as I suit up and she orgasms at least as many times as I do, she\u0027s good. I\u0027m actually okay with her, and not just because she could suck chrome off a bumper. It\u0027s relaxing being with someone who just wants to have fun and causes no stress.\" \"Gideon knows me. He understands and tries to work around my issues. He\u0027s working for this, too, Cary. It\u0027s not easy for him, either.\" \"Do you think Cross had a nooner with his ex?\" he asked bluntly. \"No.\" \"Are you sure?\" Sucking in a deep breath, I took a fortifying gulp and admitted, \"Mostly. I think I\u0027m the one doing it for him now. It\u0027s pretty hot with us, you know? But his ex has some kind of hold on him. He says it\u0027s guilt, but that doesn\u0027t explain his brunette fascination.\" \"It explains why you lost it and hit him - her being around again is eating at you. And he still won\u0027t tell you what\u0027s going on. Does that sound healthy to you?\" It wasn\u0027t. I knew that. I hated it. \"We saw Dr. Petersen last night.\" His brows rose. \"How\u0027d that go?\" \"He didn\u0027t tell us to run far, far away from each other as fast as we can.\" \"And if he does? Will you listen?\" \"I\u0027m not bailing when things get rough this time. Seriously, Cary\" - I held his gaze - \"am I really all that far ahead if I can\u0027t take any waves?\" \"Baby girl, Cross is a tsunami.\" \"Ha!\" I smiled, unable to help it. Cary could get me to smile through tears. \"To tell you the truth, if I don\u0027t work this out with Gideon, I have doubts I\u0027ll work it out with anyone.\" \"That\u0027s your shitty self-esteem talking.\" \"He knows what I\u0027m carrying around in me.\" \"All right.\" My brows shot up. \"All right?\" That was too easy. \"I\u0027m not sold. But I\u0027ll deal.\" He grabbed my hand. \"Come on. Let\u0027s get your hair done.\" I smiled, grateful. \"You\u0027re the best.\" He bumped his hip into mine. \"And I won\u0027t let you forget it.\" Chapter 5 \"As far as death traps go,\" Cary said, \"this one\u0027s pretty swank.\" I shook my head as I preceded him into the main cabin of Gideon\u0027s private jet. \"You are not going to die. Flying is safer than driving.\" \"And you don\u0027t think the airline industry paid for the compilation of those statistics?\" Pausing to smack him in the shoulder with a laugh, I glanced at the amazingly opulent interior and felt more than a little awe. I\u0027d seen my share of private planes over the years, but as usual, Gideon went to lengths to which few could afford to go. The cabin was spacious, with a wide center aisle. The underlying palette was neutral with accents of chocolate brown and ice blue. Deep, swiveling bucket seats with tables were positioned on the left, while a sectional sofa sat on the right. Each chair had a private entertainment console beside it. I knew a bedroom would be found at the back of the plane and a luxurious bathroom or two. A male flight attendant took my duffel bag and Cary\u0027s, then gestured for us to take a seat at one of the groupings of chairs that had a table. \"Mr. Cross is expected within the next ten minutes,\" he said. \"In the meantime, can I serve you something to drink?\" \"Water for me, please.\" I glanced at my watch. It was just past seven thirty. \"Bloody Mary,\" Cary ordered, \"if you\u0027ve got it.\" The steward smiled. \"We\u0027ve got everything.\" Cary caught my look. \"What? I haven\u0027t had dinner. The tomato juice will hold me over until we eat, and the alcohol will help the Dramamine kick in faster.\" \"I didn\u0027t say anything,\" I protested. I turned to look out the window at the evening sky, and my thoughts settled on Gideon, as usual. He\u0027d been quiet all day, starting with when he\u0027d woken up. The ride to work had been made in silence, and when my day ended at five, he\u0027d called just long enough to tell me that Angus would take me home alone, then drive me and Cary to the airport where he\u0027d meet us. I opted to walk home instead, since I hadn\u0027t hit the gym the night before and didn\u0027t have time to work out prior to the flight. Angus had cautioned that Gideon wouldn\u0027t like me refusing the ride, even though I\u0027d done it politely and with good reason. I think Angus thought I was still upset with him for giving Corinne a ride, which I kind of was. I was sorry to say that a tiny part of me hoped he\u0027d feel bad about it. A bigger part of me hated that I could be that petty. As I\u0027d walked through Central Park, taking a meandering path through tall trees, I had determined that I wasn\u0027t going to be small over a guy. Not even Gideon. I wasn\u0027t going to let my frustration with him get in the way of having a good time in Vegas with my best friend. Halfway home, I\u0027d stopped and turned, picking out Gideon\u0027s penthouse high above Fifth Avenue. I wondered if he was there, packing and planning for a weekend without me. Or if he was still at work, wrapping up the week\u0027s pressing business. \"Uh-oh,\" Cary singsonged, as the flight attendant returned with a tray laden with our drinks. \"You\u0027ve got that look.\" \"What look?\" \"The hell-on-wheels look.\" He clinked his tall, slender glass against the side of my squat tumbler. \"Wanna talk about it?\" I was about to reply when Gideon stepped onto the plane. He looked grim and carried a briefcase in one hand and a duffel in the other. After passing his bag over to the attendant, he paused by me and Cary, giving my roommate a cursory nod before brushing the back of his fingers across my cheek. The simple touch shot through me like a surge of electricity.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reflected-in-you-crossfire-2/page-12.html","bookId":1923,"book":{"id":1923,"title":"Reflected in You (Crossfire #2)","description":"Storyline: Reflected in You (Crossfire #2) Gideon Cross.
