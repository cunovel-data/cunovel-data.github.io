{"id":63482,"no":30,"title":"Page 30","content":"\"Wash it away.\" There was a long pause. He sat there, utterly still except for the heavy lift and fall of his chest. \"Please, Gideon.\" With muttered curse, he released me, his hand falling limply to his side. \"Do it.\" I rushed to get to him, my pulse pounding at the thought that he might change his mind and deny me . that he might decide he was done with me. The only help he gave me was a momentary lift of his hips, so I could yank his jeans and boxer briefs out of the way. Then his big, beautiful cock was in my hands. My mouth. I moaned at the taste of him, at the warmth and satiny softness of his skin, at the smell of him. I nuzzled my cheek against his groin and balls, wanting his scent all over me, marking me as his. My tongue followed the thick veins coursing the length of him, licking him up and down. I heard his teeth grind when I sucked him with long drawing pulls, moans of apology and bliss vibrating in my throat. It broke my heart that he was so silent, my vocal lover who always talked dirty to me. Always told me what he wanted and needed . how good he felt when I made love to him. He was holding himself back, denying me the satisfaction of knowing I pleased him. Pumping the thick root with my fist, I milked him, sucking on the plush crown, luring his pre-cum to the tip where I could lick it up with rapid flutters of my tongue. His thighs bunched, his breath came in fierce pants. I felt him coil tight and I went wild, double-fisting him, my mouth working so hard that my jaw ached. His spine straightened, his head lifting from the seat only to slam backward as the first thick spurt exploded in my mouth. I whimpered, his flavor igniting my senses, making me crave more. I swallowed convulsively, my hands pulling and rubbing on his throbbing penis to lure more of his rich, creamy semen onto my tongue. His body quaked as he came for long minutes, filling my mouth until he spilled out of the sides of my lips. He made no sound, as unnaturally silent as he\u0027d been during the fight. I would\u0027ve sucked him off for hours. I wanted to, but he put both hands on my shoulders and urged me away. I looked up into his heartrendingly gorgeous face, saw his eyes glittering in the semidarkness. He touched my lips with his thumb, smearing his semen over and around the swollen curves. \"Slide your tight cunt around me,\" he ordered hoarsely. \"I\u0027ve got more to give you.\" Shaky and frightened by his harsh remoteness, I wriggled out of my boy shorts. \"Take it all off. Everything except the boots.\" I did as he said, my body quickening at his command. I\u0027d do anything he wanted. I would prove to him that I was his and only his. I would atone however he needed me to so he\u0027d know I loved him. I unzipped my skirt and pushed it off, then whipped my tank top over my head and threw it on the opposite bench. My bra followed. When I straddled him, Gideon caught my hips and looked up at me. \"Are you wet?\" \"Yes.\" \"It turns you on to suck my cock.\" My nipples hardened further. The blunt, crude way he talked about sex turned me on, too. \"Always.\" \"Why did you kiss him?\" The abrupt change in topic knocked me askew. My lower lip trembled. \"I don\u0027t know.\" He released me, reaching up and over his shoulders with both hands to grip the sides of the headrest. His biceps bulged with the pose. I was aroused by the sight, as I was by everything about him. I wanted to see his bare chest glistening with sweat, his abs tightening and flexing as he pumped his cock into me. I licked my lips, tasting him. \"Take your shirt off.\" His gaze narrowed. \"This isn\u0027t for you.\" I stilled, my heart racing in my chest. He was using sex against me. In the limo where we\u0027d first made love, in the same position I\u0027d first taken him . \"You\u0027re punishing me.\" \"You\u0027ve earned it.\" It didn\u0027t matter that he was right. If I\u0027d earned it, so had he. I gripped the top of the seat back for balance and wrapped the fingers of my other hand around his cock. He was still hard, still throbbing. A muscle in his neck twitched as I stroked him in my fist, priming him. I placed the wide crest between the lips of my cleft, rubbing him back and forth, coating him with the slickness of my desire. My gaze never left his. I watched him as I teased us both, looking for any sign of the passionate lover I adored. He wasn\u0027t there. A furious stranger glared back at me, daring me, taunting me with his detachment. I let the first thick inch push inside me, spreading me open. Then I slammed my hips down, crying out as he pierced me deep and stretched me almost unbearably. \"Jesus. Fuck,\" he bit out, shuddering. \"Goddamn it.\" His uncontrolled outburst spurred me. Digging my knees into the seat, I set my hands on either side of his and lifted, pulling off him, my trembling sex clinging tightly. I pushed back down, the glide easier now that he was wet from me. When my buttocks hit his thighs I found his muscles hard as stone, his body giving away the lie - he wasn\u0027t indifferent. I lifted again, slowly, making us both feel every nuance of the delicious friction. When I pushed back down, I tried to be as stoic as he was, but the sensation of fullness, the heated connection, was too exquisite to contain. I moaned, and he shifted restlessly, his hips moving in a delicious little circle before he could stop himself. \"You feel so good,\" I whispered, stroking his raging cock with my eager, aching sex. Sliding up and down. \"You\u0027re all I need, Gideon. All I want. You were made for me.\" \"You forgot that,\" he bit out, his knuckles white from his grip on the seat back. I wondered if he was just holding on or physically restraining himself from reaching for me. \"Never. I could never forget. You\u0027re a part of me.\" \"Tell me why you kissed him.\" \"I don\u0027t know.\" I rested my damp forehead against his, feeling the tears burning behind my eyes. \"God, Gideon. I swear I don\u0027t know.\" \"Then shut up and make me come.\" If he\u0027d slapped my face, it couldn\u0027t have shocked me more. I straightened and leaned away from him. \"Fuck you.\" \"Now you\u0027re getting the idea.\" Hot tears slid down my face. \"Don\u0027t treat me like a whore.\" \"Eva.\" His voice was low and raspy, filled with warning, but his eyes were dark and desolate. Filled with pain that matched my own. \"You want to stop, you know what to say.\" Crossfire. With one word I could unmistakably, irrefutably put an end to this agony. But I couldn\u0027t use it now. Just the fact that he brought up my safe word told me he was testing me. Pushing me. He had an agenda, and if I gave up now, I\u0027d never know what it was.Reaching behind me, I set my hands on his knees. I arched my back and dragged my soaked sex along the rigid length of his cock, then slammed back down. I adjusted the angle, lifted and fell again, gasping at the feel of him. Mad as hell or not, my body worshipped his. Loved the feel of him, the sense of rightness that was there despite the anger and hurt. His breath was powering out of his lungs with every plunge of my hips. His body was hot, so hot, radiating heat like a blast furnace. I pumped my hips. Up. Down. Taking the pleasure he refused to give me. My thighs, buttocks, stomach, and core tightened with every lift, fisting him from root to tip. They relaxed when I dropped, letting him sink deep. I fucked him with everything I had, pounding myself onto his cock. His breath hissed out between his clenched teeth. Then he was coming hard, jetting inside me so fiercely I felt each scorching burst of semen like a separate thrust. I cried out, loving the feel of it, chasing an orgasm that would shatter me. I was wound so tightly, my body desperate for release after pleasing him twice. But he moved, grabbing me by the waist and restraining my movements, holding himself deep as he pumped me full. I choked off a scream when I realized he was deliberately preventing me from coming. \"Tell me why, Eva,\" he growled. \"Why?\" \"I don\u0027t know!\" I yelled, trying to grind my hips onto him, pounding his shoulders with my fists when his grip tightened. Holding me pinned to his pelvis and filled with his cock, Gideon pushed to his feet and everything shifted. He pulled out of me, flipped me to face away from him, then bent me over the edge of the seat with my knees on the floorboard. With one hand at the small of my back, holding me down, he cupped my sex and rubbed, massaging his semen into my cleft. He spread it around, coating me with it. My hips circled, seeking that perfect bit of pressure to get me off . He kept it from me. Deliberately. The pounding in my clit and the needy clenching of my empty core was driving me mad, my body hungry for release. He pushed two fingers into me and my nails dug into the black leather seat. He finger-fucked me leisurely, sliding lazily in and out, keeping me on the edge. \"Gideon,\" I sobbed, the sensitive tissues inside me rippling greedily around him. I was coated in sweat, barely able to breathe. I began to pray for the car to stop, for us to reach our destination, holding my breath in desperate anticipation of escape. But the limo never pulled over. It kept driving and driving, and I was restrained so completely that I couldn\u0027t rise up enough to see where we were.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reflected-in-you-crossfire-2/page-30.html","bookId":1923,"book":{"id":1923,"title":"Reflected in You (Crossfire #2)","description":"Storyline: Reflected in You (Crossfire #2) Gideon Cross.
