At some point you have to say you gave it your best shot and it didn\u0027t work out.\n Right?\" Dr.\n Petersen\u0027s head tilted to the side.\n \"And if you don\u0027t, what\u0027s the worst that could happen?\" \"You\u0027re asking me?\" \"Yes.\n Worst-case scenario.\"\n \"Well .\"\n I splayed my fingers on my thighs.\n \"He keeps drifting away from me, which makes me cling harder and lose all sense of self-worth.\n And we end up with him going back to life as he knew it and me going back to therapy trying to get my head on straight again.\"\n He continued to look at me, and something about his patient watchfulness prodded me to keep talking.\n \"I\u0027m afraid that he won\u0027t cut me loose when it\u0027s time and that I won\u0027t know better.\n That I\u0027ll keep hanging on to the sinking ship and go down with it.\n I just wish I could trust that he\u0027d end it, if it comes to that.\"\n \"Do you think that needs to happen?\" \"I don\u0027t know.\n Maybe.\"\n I pulled my gaze away from the clock on the wall.\n \"But considering it\u0027s nearly seven and he stood us both up tonight, it seems likely.\"\n It was crazy to me that I wasn\u0027t surprised to find the Bentley waiting outside my apartment at quarter to five in the morning.\n The driver who climbed out from behind the wheel when I stepped outside wasn\u0027t familiar to me.\n He was much younger than Angus; early thirties was my guess.\n He looked Latino, with rich caramel-hued skin, and dark hair and eyes.\n \"Thanks,\" I told him, when he rounded the front of the vehicle, \"but I\u0027ll just grab a cab.\"\n Hearing that, the night doorman to my building stepped out to the street to flag one down for me.\n \"Mr.\n Cross said I\u0027m to take you to La Guardia,\" the driver said.\n \"You can tell Mr.\n Cross that I won\u0027t be requiring his transportation services now or in the future.\"\n I moved toward the cab the doorman had hailed, but stopped and turned around.\n \"And tell him to go fuck himself, too.\"\n I slid into the cab and settled back as it pulled away.\n I\u0027ll admit to some bias when I say my father stands out in a crowd, but that didn\u0027t make it less true.\n As he exited the secure security area, Victor Reyes commanded attention.\n He was six feet tall, fit and well built, and had the commanding presence of a man who wore a badge.\n His gaze raked the immediate area around him, always a cop even when he wasn\u0027t on duty.\n He had a duffel bag slung over his shoulder and wore blue jeans with a black button-down shirt.\n His hair was dark and wavy, his eyes stormy and gray like mine.\n He was seriously hot in a brooding, dangerous, bad boy sort of way, and I tried to picture him alongside my mother\u0027s fragile, haughty beauty.\n I\u0027d never seen them together, not even in pictures, and I really wanted to.\n If only just once.\n \"Daddy!\" I yelled, waving.\n His face lit up when he saw me, and a wide smile curved his mouth.\n \"There\u0027s my girl.\"\n He picked me up in a hug that had my feet dangling above the floor.\n \"I\u0027ve missed you like crazy.\"\n I started crying.\n I couldn\u0027t help it.\n Being with him again was the last emotional straw.\n \"Hey.\"\n He rocked me.\n \"What\u0027s with the tears?\" I wrapped my arms tighter around his neck, so grateful to have him with me, knowing all the other troubles in my life would fade into the background while he was around.\n \"I missed you like crazy, too,\" I said, sniffling.\n We took a cab back to my place.\n On the ride over, my dad asked me the same sort of investigative questions about Cary\u0027s attack as the detectives had asked Cary in the hospital.\n I tried to keep him distracted with that discussion when we pulled up outside my building, but it didn\u0027t do any good.\n My dad\u0027s eagle eyes took in the modern glass overhang attached to the brick fa?ade of the building.\n He stared at the doorman, Paul, who touched the brim of his hat and opened the door for us.\n He studied the front desk and concierge, and rocked back on his heels as we waited for the elevator.\n He didn\u0027t say anything and kept his poker face on, but I knew he was thinking about how much my digs must cost in a city like New York.\n When I showed him into my apartment, his sweeping gaze took in the size of the place.\n The massive windows had a stunning view of the city, and the flat- screen television mounted on the wall was just one of the many top-of-the- line electronics on display.\n He knew I couldn\u0027t afford the place on my own.\n He knew my mother\u0027s husband was providing for me in ways he would never be able to.\n And I wondered if he thought about my mother, and how what she needed was also beyond his means.\n \"The security here is really tight,\" I told him by way of explanation.\n \"It\u0027s impossible to get past the front desk if you\u0027re not on the list and a resident can\u0027t be reached to vouch for you.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reflected-in-you-crossfire-2/page-44.html","bookId":1923,"book":{"id":1923,"title":"Reflected in You (Crossfire #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Reflected in You (Crossfire #2) \n Gideon Cross.
