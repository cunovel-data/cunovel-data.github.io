I don\u0027t think Mom could sleep at night otherwise.\" That made some of the tension leave his shoulders. \"Let me show you to your room.\" I led him down the hallway to the guest room suite. It had its own bathroom and mini-bar with fridge. I saw him noting those things before he dropped his duffel on the king-size bed. \"Are you tired?\" He looked at me. \"I know you are. And you have to work today, don\u0027t you? Why don\u0027t we nap for a bit before you have to get up?\" I stifled a yawn and nodded, knowing I could use the couple of hours of shut-eye. \"Sounds good.\" \"Wake me when you\u0027re up,\" he said, rolling his shoulders back. \"I\u0027ll make the coffee while you\u0027re getting ready.\" \"Awesome.\" My voice came husky with suppressed tears. Gideon almost always had coffee waiting for me on days when he\u0027d spent the night, because he got up before me. I missed that little ritual of ours. Somehow, I\u0027d have to learn to live without it. Pushing up onto my tiptoes, I kissed my dad\u0027s cheek. \"I\u0027m so glad you\u0027re here, Daddy.\" I closed my eyes and clung tightly when he hugged me. I stepped out of the small market with my bags of grocery ingredients for dinner and frowned at finding Angus idling at the curb. I\u0027d refused a ride in the morning and again when I\u0027d left the Crossfire, and he was still following and shadowing. It was ridiculous. I couldn\u0027t help but wonder if Gideon didn\u0027t want me as a girlfriend anymore, but his neurotic lust for my body meant that he didn\u0027t want anyone else to have me - namely Brett. As I walked home, I entertained thoughts of having Brett over for dinner instead, imagining Angus having to make that call to Gideon when Brett came strolling up to my place. It was just a quick vengeful fantasy, since I wouldn\u0027t lead Brett on that way and he was in Florida anyway, but it did the trick. My step lightened and when I entered my apartment, I was in my first really good mood in days.I dumped all the dinner stuff off in the kitchen, then went to find my dad. He was hanging out in Cary\u0027s room playing a video game. Cary worked a nunchuk one-handed, since his other hand was in a cast. \"Woo!\" my dad shouted. \"Spanked.\" \"You should be ashamed of yourself,\" Cary shot back, \"taking advantage of an invalid.\" \"I\u0027m crying a river here.\" Cary looked at me in the doorway and winked. I loved him so much in that moment I couldn\u0027t stop myself from crossing over to him and pressing a kiss to his bruised forehead. \"Thank you,\" I whispered. \"Thank me with dinner. I\u0027m starving.\" I straightened. \"I got the goods to make enchiladas.\" My dad looked at me, smiling, knowing I\u0027d need his help. \"Yeah?\" \"When you\u0027re ready,\" I told him. \"I\u0027m going to grab a shower.\" Forty-five minutes later, my dad and I were in the kitchen rolling cheese and store-bought rotisserie chicken - my little cheat to save time - into lard- soaked white corn tortillas. In the living room, the CD changer slipped in the next disk and Van Morrison\u0027s soulful voice piped through the surround sound speakers. \"Oh yeah,\" my dad said, reaching for my hand and tugging me away from the counter. \"Hum-de-rum, hum-de- rum, moondance,\" he sang in his deep baritone, twirling me. I laughed, delighted. Using the back of his hand against my spine to keep his greasy fingers off me, he swept me into a dance around the island, both of us singing the song and laughing. We were making our second revolution when I noticed the two people standing at the breakfast bar. My smile fled and I stumbled, forcing my dad to catch me. \"You got two left feet?\" he teased, his eyes only on me. \"Eva\u0027s a wonderful dancer,\" Gideon interjected, his face arrested in that implacable mask I detested. My dad turned, his smile fading, too.Gideon rounded the bar and entered the kitchen. He\u0027d dressed for the occasion in jeans and a Yankees T- shirt. It was a suitably casual choice and a conversation starter, since my dad was a die-hard Padres fan. \"I hadn\u0027t realized she was such a good singer, as well. Gideon Cross,\" he introduced himself, holding out his hand. \"Victor Reyes.\" My dad waved his shiny fingers. \"I\u0027m a bit messy.\" \"I don\u0027t mind.\" Shrugging, my dad took his hand and sized him up. I tossed the dish towel to the guys and made my way over to Ireland, who was positively glowing. Her blue eyes were bright, her cheeks flushed with pleasure. \"I\u0027m so glad you could make it,\" I said, hugging her carefully. \"You look gorgeous!\" \"So do you!\" It was a fib, but I appreciated it anyway. I hadn\u0027t done anything to my face or hair after my shower, because I knew my dad wouldn\u0027t care and I hadn\u0027t expected Gideon to show up. After all, the last time I\u0027d heard from him had been when he\u0027d said he would meet me at Dr. Petersen\u0027s office. She looked over at the counter where I\u0027d dumped everything. \"Can I help?\" \"Sure. Just don\u0027t count calories in your head - it\u0027ll explode.\" I introduced her to my dad, who was much warmer to her than he was to Gideon, and then I led her to the sink, where she washed up. In short order, I had her helping to roll the last few enchiladas, while my dad put the already chilled Dos Equis Gideon had brought into the fridge. I didn\u0027t even bother to wonder how Gideon knew I was serving Mexican food for dinner. I only wondered why he\u0027d invest the time to find out when it was very clear he other things to do - like ditch his appointments. My dad went to his room to wash up. Gideon came up behind me and put his hands on my waist, his lips brushing over my temple. \"Eva.\" I tensed against the nearly irresistible urge to lean into him. \"Don\u0027t,\" I whispered. \"I\u0027d rather we didn\u0027t pretend.\" His breath left him in a rush that ruffled my hair. His fingers tightened on my hips, kneading for a moment. Then I felt his phone vibrate and he released me, backing away to look at the screen. \"Excuse me,\" he said gruffly, leaving the kitchen before answering. Ireland sidled over and whispered, \"Thank you. I know you made him bring me along.\" I managed a smile for her. \"Nobody can make Gideon do anything he doesn\u0027t want to.\" \"You could.\" She tossed her head, throwing her sleek waist-length black hair over her shoulder. \"You didn\u0027t see him watching you dance with your dad. His eyes got all shiny. I thought he was going to cry. And on the way up here, in the elevator, he tried to play it off, but I could totally tell he was nervous.\" I stared down at the can of enchilada sauce in my hands, feeling my heart break a little more. \"You\u0027re mad at him, aren\u0027t you?\" Ireland asked. I cleared my throat. \"Some people are just better off as friends.\" \"But you said you love him.\" \"That\u0027s not always enough.\" I turned around to reach the can opener and found Gideon standing at the other end of the island, staring at me. I froze. A muscle in his jaw twitched before he unclenched it. \"Would you like a beer?\" he asked gruffly. I nodded. I could\u0027ve used a shot, too. Maybe a few. \"Want a glass?\" \"No.\" He looked at Ireland. \"You thirsty? There\u0027s soda, water, milk.\" \"How about one of those beers?\" she shot back, flashing a winsome smile. \"Try again,\" he said wryly. I watched Ireland, noting how she sparkled when Gideon focused on her. I couldn\u0027t believe he didn\u0027t see how she loved him. Maybe right now it was based on superficial things, but it was there and it would grow with a little encouragement. I hoped he\u0027d work on that.When Gideon handed me the chilled beer, his fingers brushed mine. He held on for a minute, looking into my eyes. I knew he was thinking about the other night. It seemed like a dream now, as if his visit never really happened. I could almost believe that I\u0027d made it up in a desperate delusion, so hungry for his touch and his love that I couldn\u0027t go another minute without giving my mind relief from the madness of wanting and craving. If it weren\u0027t for the lingering soreness deep inside me, I wouldn\u0027t know what was real and what was nothing but false hope. I pulled the beer out of his grasp and turned away. I didn\u0027t want to say we were done and over, but it was certain now that we needed a break from each other. Gideon needed to figure out what he was doing, what he was looking for, and whether I had any meaningful place in his life. Because this roller-coaster ride we were on was going to break me, and I couldn\u0027t let that happen. I wouldn\u0027t. \"Can I help with anything?\" he asked. I answered without looking at him, because doing so was too painful. \"Can you see if we can get Cary out here? He\u0027s got a wheelchair.\" \"All right.\" He left the room, and I could suddenly breathe deeply again. Ireland hurried over. \"What happened to Cary?\" \"I\u0027ll tell you about it while we set the table.\" I was surprised I could eat. I think I was too fascinated by the silent showdown between my dad and Gideon to notice that I was stuffing food into my mouth. At one end of the table, Cary was charming Ireland into peals of laughter that kept making me smile.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reflected-in-you-crossfire-2/page-45.html","bookId":1923,"book":{"id":1923,"title":"Reflected in You (Crossfire #2)","description":"Storyline: Reflected in You (Crossfire #2) Gideon Cross.
