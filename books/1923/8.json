You told her to keep quiet about what she is to you.\\n\\n Too bad Magdalene screwed that up.\"\\n\\n And maybe Corinne and Magdalene had planned it that way.\\n\\n Corinne knew Gideon well enough to anticipate his moves; it might\u0027ve been easy for her to plan around his reaction to her unexpected appearance in New York.\\n\\n Which shed a whole new light on why Magdalene had called me today.\\n\\n She and Corinne had been talking at the Waldorf when Gideon and I spotted them.\\n\\n Two women who wanted a man who was with another woman.\\n\\n Nothing was going to happen for them while I was in the picture, and because of that, I couldn\u0027t rule out the possibility that they might be working together.\\n\\n \"I wanted you to hear it from me,\" he said tightly.\\n\\n I waved that off, more concerned about what was happening now.\\n\\n \"I saw Corinne get into the Bentley, Gideon.\\n\\n Right before I came up here.\"\\n\\n His other brow rose to match the first.\\n\\n \"Did you?\" \"Yes, I did.\\n\\n Can you explain that?\" \"I can\u0027t, no.\"\\n\\n Injured fury burned through me.\\n\\n I suddenly couldn\u0027t bear to even look at him.\\n\\n \"Then get out of my way, I have to get back to work.\"\\n\\n He didn\u0027t move.\\n\\n \"I just want to be clear on something before you go: Do you believe I fucked her?\" Hearing him say it aloud made me flinch.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know what to believe.\\n\\n The evidence sure - \" \"I wouldn\u0027t care if the \u0027evidence\u0027 included you finding me and her naked in a bed together.\"\\n\\n He uncoiled so swiftly, I stumbled back in surprise.\\n\\n He stalked closer.\\n\\n \"I want to know if you think I fucked her.\\n\\n If you think I would.\\n\\n Or could.\\n\\n Do you?\" My foot began to tap, but I didn\u0027t retreat.\\n\\n \"Explain the lipstick on your shirt, Gideon.\"\\n\\n His jaw tightened.\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n \"What?\" The flat-out refusal sent me into a tailspin.\\n\\n \"Answer my question.\"\\n\\n I studied his face and saw the mask he wore around other people but had never worn with me.\\n\\n He reached his hand toward me as if to brush my cheek with his fingertips, then pulled back at the last minute.\\n\\n In that brief instant in which he pulled away, I heard his teeth grind, as if not touching me was a struggle.\\n\\n Agonized, I was grateful he hadn\u0027t.\\n\\n \"I need you to explain,\" I whispered, wondering if I imagined the wince that crossed his face.\\n\\n Sometimes I wanted to believe something so badly, I deliberately manufactured excuses and ignored painful reality.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve given you no reason to doubt me.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re giving me one now, Gideon.\"\\n\\n I exhaled in a rush, deflating.\\n\\n Withdrawing.\\n\\n He was standing in front of me, but he seemed miles away.\\n\\n \"I understand you need time before you share secrets that are painful for you.\\n\\n I\u0027ve been where you\u0027re at, knowing I needed to talk about what happened to me but just not ready.\\n\\n That\u0027s why I\u0027ve tried very hard not to push you or rush you.\\n\\n But this secret is one that\u0027s hurting me, and that\u0027s different.\\n\\n Don\u0027t you see that?\" Cursing under his breath, he cupped my face with cool hands.\\n\\n \"I go out of my way to make sure you don\u0027t have any reason to feel jealous, but when you do get possessive, I like it.\\n\\n I want you to fight for me.\\n\\n I want you to care that much.\\n\\n I want you crazy about me.\\n\\n But possessiveness without trust is hell.\\n\\n If you don\u0027t trust me, we\u0027ve got nothing.\"\\n\\n \"Trust goes both ways, Gideon.\"\\n\\n He sucked in a deep breath.\\n\\n \"Damn it.\\n\\n Don\u0027t look at me like that.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m trying to figure out who you are.\\n\\n Where\u0027s the man who came right out and said he wanted to fuck me? The man who didn\u0027t hesitate to tell me I tie him up in knots, even as I was breaking up with him? I believed you\u0027d always be brutally honest like that.\\n\\n I counted on it.\\n\\n Now - \" I shook my head, my throat too tight to say anything else.\\n\\n Grimness thinned his lips, but they stayed stubbornly closed.\\n\\n Catching his wrists, I pulled his hands away.\\n\\n I was cracking open inside, breaking.\\n\\n \"I won\u0027t run this time, but you can push me away.\\n\\n You might want to think about that.\"\\n\\n I left.\\n\\n Gideon didn\u0027t stop me.\\n\\n I spent the rest of the afternoon focused on work.\\n\\n Mark loved to brainstorm out loud, which was an awesome learning exercise for me, and his confident and amiable way of dealing with his accounts was inspiring.\\n\\n I watched him breeze through two client meetings in which he conveyed an air of command that was both reassuring and nonthreatening.\\n\\n Then we tackled a baby-toy company\u0027s needs analysis, zeroing in on poor return expenditures as well as untapped avenues, such as mom-blog advertising.\\n\\n I was grateful that my job was a distraction from my personal life, and I was looking forward to going to my Krav Maga class later, so I could burn off some of my edgy restlessness.\\n\\n It was just past four when my desk phone rang.\\n\\n I answered briskly and felt my heart leap at the sound of Gideon\u0027s voice.\\n\\n \"We should leave at five,\" he said, \"to get to Dr.\\n\\n Petersen\u0027s on time.\"\\n\\n \"Oh.\"\\n\\n I\u0027d forgotten that our couples therapy sessions were on Thursdays at six P.M.\\n\\n It would be our first.\\n\\n Abruptly, I wondered if it would also be our last.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll come get you,\" he went on gruffly, \"when it\u0027s time.\"\\n\\n I sighed, feeling far from up to it.\\n\\n I was already raw and irritable from our fight earlier.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry I hit you.\\n\\n I shouldn\u0027t have done that.\\n\\n I hate that I did.\"\\n\\n \"Angel.\"\\n\\n Gideon exhaled harshly.\\n\\n \"You didn\u0027t ask the one question that matters.\"\\n\\n My eyes closed.\\n\\n It was irritating how he read my mind.\\n\\n \"Either way, it doesn\u0027t change the fact that you\u0027re keeping secrets.\"\\n\\n \"Secrets are something we can work through;
