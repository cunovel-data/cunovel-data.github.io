{"id":63480,"no":28,"title":"Page 28","content":"It was so easy to forget how it\u0027d been between us while I was listening to him sing. It was so easy to want to forget after listening to the song he\u0027d written. But that time in my past was something I was far from proud of. \"The band\u0027s right in here,\" Robert was saying, gesturing to an open door from which music and raucous laughter poured out. \"They\u0027ll be excited to meet you.\" My feet dug in suddenly and Gideon paused, glancing at me with a frown. I pushed up onto my toes and whispered, \"I\u0027m not all that interested in meeting them. If you don\u0027t mind, I\u0027m going to hit the backstage bathroom and head out to the limo.\" \"Can you wait a few minutes and I\u0027ll go with you?\" \"I\u0027ll be okay. Don\u0027t worry about me.\" He touched my forehead. \"Are you feeling all right? You look flushed.\" \"I\u0027m feeling great. I\u0027ll show you exactly how great as soon as we get home.\" That did the trick. His frown faded and his mouth curved. \"I\u0027ll hurry this along, then.\" He looked at Robert Phillips and gestured at Arnoldo and Shawna. \"Can you take them in? I need a minute.\" \"Gideon, really .\" I protested. \"I\u0027m walking you over there.\" I knew that tone. I let him walk me the twenty feet to the bathroom. \"I can take it from here, ace.\" \"I\u0027ll wait.\" \"Then we\u0027ll never get out of here. Go do your thing. I\u0027ll be fine.\" He gave me a very patient look. \"Eva, I\u0027m not leaving you alone.\" \"I can manage. Seriously. The exit is right there.\" I pointed down the hall to the open double doors beneath a lighted exit sign. Roadies were already transporting equipment out. \"Angus is right out there, isn\u0027t he?\" Gideon leaned his shoulder into the wall and crossed his arms. I threw up my hands. \"Okay. Fine. Have it your way.\" \"You\u0027re learning, angel,\" he said with a smile. Muttering under my breath, I went into the bathroom and took care of business. As I washed up at the sink, I looked into the mirror and winced. I had raccoon eyes from sweating so damn much and my pupils were dark and dilated. \"What does he see in you?\" I asked myself derisively, thinking of how awesome he still looked. As hot and sweaty as he\u0027d been, he looked none the worse for wear, while I looked damp and limp. But more so than my exterior, it was my personal failings I was thinking of. I couldn\u0027t get away from them. Not while Brett was in the same building with us. I rubbed a dampened square of paper towel under my eyes to get rid of the black smudges, then headed back out to the hall. Gideon waited a few feet away, talking with Robert, or more accurately, listening to him. The band\u0027s manager was clearly excited about something. Gideon spotted me and held up a hand to get me to wait a minute, but I didn\u0027t want to take the risk. I gestured down the hall at the exit, then turned and headed that way before he could stall me. I hurried past the green room door, chancing a quick glance inside to see Shawna laughing with a beer in her hand. The room was packed and boisterous, and she looked like she was having a great time. I made my escape with a sigh of relief, feeling ten times lighter the moment I left. Spotting Angus standing next to Gideon\u0027s limo on the far side of the line of buses, I waved and set off toward him. Looking back on the night, I was tantalized by how uninhibited Gideon had been. He sure as hell hadn\u0027t been the man who\u0027d used mergers and acquisitions as parlance for getting me into bed. I couldn\u0027t wait to get him naked. A burst of flame in the darkness to my right startled me. I jolted to a halt and watched Brett Kline lift a match to the clove cigarette hanging from his lips. As he stood in the shadows to the side of the exit, the flickering light of the flame caressed his face and threw me back in time for a long minute. He glanced up, caught me in his gaze, and froze. We stared at each other. My heart kicked into a mad beat, a combination of excitement and apprehension. He cursed suddenly, shaking out the match as it burned his fingers. I took off, struggling to maintain a casual pace as I made a beeline for Angus and the limo. \"Hey! Hold up,\" Brett shouted. I heard his footsteps approaching at a jog, and adrenaline surged through me. A roadie was pushing a flat hand truck loaded with heavy gear and I darted around him, using him as cover to duck between two buses. I pressed my back flat against the side of one, standing between two open cargo compartments. I cringed into the shadows, feeling like a coward, but knowing I had nothing to say to Brett. I wasn\u0027t the girl he knew anymore. I watched him rush by. I decided to wait, give him time to look and give up. I was hyperaware of the time passing, of the fact that Gideon would be looking for me soon. \"Eva.\" I flinched at the sound of my name. Turning my head, I found Brett approaching from the other side. While I\u0027d been looking to the right, he\u0027d come up on the left. \"It is you,\" he said roughly. He dropped his clove smoke on the ground and crushed it beneath his boot. I heard myself saying something familiar. \"You should quit.\" \"So you keep telling me.\" He approached cautiously. \"You saw the show?\" I nodded and stepped away from the bus, backing up. \"It was awesome. You guys sound really great. I\u0027m happy for you.\" He took a step forward for every one of mine backward. \"I was hoping I\u0027d find you like this, at one of the shows. I had a hundred different ideas about how it might go if I saw you at one.\" I didn\u0027t know what to say to that. The tension between us was so thick it was hard to breathe. The attraction was still there. It was nothing like what I felt with Gideon. Nothing more than a shadow of that, but it was there nonetheless. I retreated back out into the open, where the activity was high and there were lots of people milling around. \"Why are you running?\" he asked. In the pool of light from a parking lot lamp, I saw him clearly. He was even better looking than before. \"I can\u0027t .\" I swallowed. \"There\u0027s nothing to say.\" \"Bullshit.\" The intensity of his glare burned through me. \"You stopped coming around. Didn\u0027t say a word, just stopped showing up. Why?\" I rubbed at the knot in my stomach. What was I going to say? I finally grew a pair and decided I deserved better than to be one of the many chicks you fucked in a bathroom stall between sets? \"Why, Eva? We had something going and you just fucking disappeared.\" Turning my head, I looked for Gideon or Angus. Neither was anywhere in sight. The limo waited alone. \"It was a long time ago.\" Brett lunged forward and caught me by the arms, startling me, briefly frightening me with the sudden aggressive movement. If we hadn\u0027t been so near other people, it might have triggered panic. \"You owe me an explanation,\" he bit out. \"It\u0027s not - \" He kissed me. He had the softest lips, and he sealed them over mine and kissed me. By the time I registered what was happening, he\u0027d tightened his grip on my arms and I couldn\u0027t move away. Couldn\u0027t push him away. And for a brief span of time I didn\u0027t want to. I even kissed him back, because the attraction was still there and it soothed something hurting inside me to think I might\u0027ve been more than a convenient piece of ass. He tasted like cloves, smelled seductively like hardworking male, and he took my mouth with all the passion of a creative soul. He was familiar, in very intimate ways. But in the end, it didn\u0027t matter that he got to me still. It didn\u0027t matter that we had a history, painful as it was for me. It didn\u0027t matter that I was flattered and affected by the lyrics he\u0027d written, that after six months of watching him enjoy other women while nailing me anywhere with a door that locked, it was me he was thinking about when he seduced screaming-for-it women from the stage. None of that mattered because I was madly in love with Gideon Cross, and he was what I needed. I wrenched away with a gasp - - and faced Gideon charging at a dead run, his speed unchecked as he rammed into Brett and took him down. Chapter 10 I stumbled back from the impact, nearly falling. The two men hit the asphalt with a sickening thud. Someone yelled. A woman screamed. I could do nothing. I stood frozen and silent, emotions twisting through me in a frenzied tangle. Gideon pinned Brett by the throat and pummeled his ribs with a relentless series of blows. He was like a machine, silent and unstoppable. Brett grunted with each brutal impact and struggled to break free. \"Cross! Dio mio.\" I wept when Arnoldo appeared. He leaped forward, reaching for Gideon, only to scramble back as Brett wrenched to the side and the two men rolled. Brett\u0027s bandmates pushed in through the growing crowd around the front of the buses, prepared to brawl . until they saw who Brett was fighting with - the man with the money behind their record label. \"Kline, you fuckhead!\" Darrin, the drummer, gripped his own hair in both fists. \"What the hell are you doing?\" Brett broke free, lurched to his feet, and tackled Gideon into the side of a bus. Gideon linked his hands and hammered Brett\u0027s back like a club, forcing Brett to lurch away.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reflected-in-you-crossfire-2/page-28.html","bookId":1923,"book":{"id":1923,"title":"Reflected in You (Crossfire #2)","description":"Storyline: Reflected in You (Crossfire #2) Gideon Cross.
