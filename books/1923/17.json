Dinner out or in? Your place or mine?\" \"I\u0027ll cook at my place.\"\n I stretched, then tugged the wrinkles out of my shirt.\n He nodded, but his vibe changed.\n My sated, grateful lover of a moment before was replaced by the grim-faced man who\u0027d been around more frequently lately.\n \"Would you prefer something different?\" I asked.\n \"No.\n It\u0027s a good plan and what I would\u0027ve suggested.\n He\u0027ll feel comfortable there.\"\n \"Will you?\" \"Yes.\"\n He propped his head in one hand and looked down at me, brushing my hair back from my forehead.\n \"I\u0027d rather not hit him in the face with my money if we can help it.\"\n I took a deep breath.\n \"I hadn\u0027t considered that.\n I just thought I\u0027d be less anxious about making a mess in my own kitchen than in yours.\n But you\u0027re right.\n It\u0027ll be okay, though, Gideon.\n Once he sees how you feel about me, he\u0027ll be good with us being together.\"\n \"I only care what he thinks if it affects how you feel.\n If he doesn\u0027t like me and that changes something between us - \" \"You\u0027re the only one who can do that.\"\n He gave a curt nod, which didn\u0027t help me feel better about what he was feeling.\n A lot of men got nervous meeting their girlfriend\u0027s parents, but Gideon wasn\u0027t like other men.\n He didn\u0027t rattle.\n Usually.\n I wanted him and my dad to be loose and easy around each other, not tense and defensive.\n I changed the subject.\n \"Did you get everything worked out in Phoenix?\" \"Yes.\n One of the project managers noted some anomalies in accounting, and she was right to push me to look deeper into it.\n Embezzling isn\u0027t something I tolerate.\"\n I winced, thinking of Gideon\u0027s father, who\u0027d bilked investors out of millions before killing himself.\n \"What\u0027s the project?\" \"A golf resort.\"\n \"Nightclubs, resorts, luxury living, vodka, casinos .\n with a chain of gyms thrown in to keep fit for the high life?\" I knew from checking out the Cross Industries website that Gideon also had software and games divisions, and a growing social media platform for young urban professionals.\n \"You\u0027re a pleasure god in more ways than one.\"\n \"Pleasure god?\" His eyes sparkled with humor.\n \"I spend all my energy worshipping you.\"\n \"How did you get to be so rich?\" I blurted out, pricked by the memory of Cary\u0027s insinuations about how Gideon could\u0027ve amassed so much at such a young age.\n \"People like to have fun, and they\u0027ll pay for the privilege.\"\n \"That\u0027s not what I meant.\n How did you get Cross Industries started? Where did you get the capital to get things going?\" His eyes took on a speculative gleam.\n \"Where do you think I got it?\" \"I have no idea,\" I told him honestly.\n \"Blackjack.\"\n I blinked.\n \"Gambling? Are you kidding?\" \"No.\"\n He laughed and tightened his arms around me.\n But I couldn\u0027t see Gideon as a gambler.\n I\u0027d learned, thanks to my mom\u0027s third husband, that gambling could become a very nasty and insidious disease that caused total lack of control.\n I just couldn\u0027t see someone as rigidly controlled as Gideon finding anything appealing about something so dependent on luck and chance.\n Then it hit me.\n \"You count cards.\"\n \"When I played,\" he agreed.\n \"I don\u0027t anymore.\n And the contacts I made over card tables were as instrumental as the money I made.\"\n I tried to absorb that information, struggled with it, then let it go for the moment.\n \"Remind me not to play cards with you.\"\n \"Strip poker could be fun.\"\n \"For you.\"\n He reached down and squeezed my ass.\n \"And for you.\n You know how I get when you\u0027re naked.\"\n I shot a pointed glance down at my fully dressed body.\n \"And when I\u0027m not naked.\"\n Gideon\u0027s grin flashed, dazzling and entirely unapologetic.\n \"Do you still gamble?\" \"Every day.\n But only in business and with you.\"\n \"With me? With our relationship?\" His gaze was soft on my face, filled with a sudden tenderness that made my throat tight.\n \"You\u0027re the greatest risk I\u0027ve ever taken.\"\n His pressed his lips gently to mine.\n \"And the greatest reward.\"\n * * * When I got to work Monday morning, I felt like things were finally settling back into their natural pre-Corinne rhythm.\n Gideon and I were dealing with adjusting to my period, which had never been an issue for either of us in any previous relationship we\u0027d had, but was in ours because sex was how he showed me what he was feeling.\n He could say with his body what he couldn\u0027t with words, and my lust for him was how I proved my faith in us, something he needed to feel connected to me.\n I could tell him I loved him over and over again, and I know it affected him when I did, but he needed the total surrender of my body - a display of trust he knew meant a great deal because of my past - to really believe it. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reflected-in-you-crossfire-2/page-17.html","bookId":1923,"book":{"id":1923,"title":"Reflected in You (Crossfire #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Reflected in You (Crossfire #2) \n Gideon Cross.
