Rock on.\n Victor\u0027s cool.\"\n We both moved into the kitchen, and he grabbed two beers out of the refrigerator.\n I\u0027d noticed earlier that a number of items and products I used at home had been stocked in the suite.\n I wondered if Gideon was just that observant or if he\u0027d found the information another way - like from looking at my receipts.\n I couldn\u0027t put it past him.\n Recognizing the boundaries between us was very difficult for him, as evidenced by his siccing his guards on me.\n \"When\u0027s the last time your parents were in the same state together?\" Cary asked, prying the caps off the bottles with a bottle opener.\n \"Let alone the same city.\"\n Ah, God .\n \"I\u0027m not sure.\n Before I was born?\" I took a long pull on the beer he handed me.\n \"I\u0027m not planning on putting them together.\"\n \"Here\u0027s to best-laid plans.\"\n He clinked the necks of our beers together.\n \"Speaking of which, I was considering a quick bang with a chick I met at the pool, but I came up here instead.\n Figured you and I\u0027d both go without today and just spend the time together.\"\n \"I\u0027m honored,\" I said dryly.\n \"I was going to come back down.\"\n \"Too hot out.\n That sun is brutal.\"\n \"Same sun we have in New York, isn\u0027t it?\" \"Smart-ass.\"\n His green eyes sparkled.\n \"How about we clean up and go out to lunch somewhere? My treat.\"\n \"Sure.\n But I can\u0027t say Sheila won\u0027t insist on tagging along.\"\n \"Fuck her and her boss.\n What is it with rich people and control issues?\" \"They get rich because they take control.\"\n \"Whatever.\n I prefer our kind of crazy - we pretty much only screw with ourselves.\"\n He crossed one arm over his chest and leaned into the counter.\n \"You gonna put up with his bullshit?\" \"Depends.\"\n \"On what?\" I grinned and started backing out toward my bedroom.\n \"Get ready.\n I\u0027ll tell you about it over lunch.\"\n Chapter 6\n I\u0027d just barely finished repacking my bag for the trip home when I heard the unmistakable sound of Gideon\u0027s voice in the living room.\n A rush of adrenaline pumped through my veins.\n Gideon had yet to say a word to me about what I\u0027d done, even though we\u0027d talked the night before after Cary and I had gotten back from clubbing and again this morning when I\u0027d woken up.\n Feigning ignorance was slightly nerve-racking.\n I\u0027d wondered if Clancy had even managed to do what I had asked of him, but when I double- checked with my stepdad\u0027s bodyguard, he assured me that all was going as I\u0027d planned.\n On bare feet, I padded over to the open door of my bedroom just in time to see Cary walk out the door of our suite.\n Gideon stood alone in the small foyer, his inscrutable gaze on me as if he\u0027d expected me to appear at any moment.\n He wore loose-fitting jeans and a black T-shirt, and I\u0027d missed the sight of him so much my eyes stung.\n \"Hi, angel.\"\n The fingers of my right hand toyed restlessly with the material of my black yoga pants.\n \"Hi, ace.\"\n His beautifully etched lips thinned for a moment.\n \"Is there a particular meaning behind that endearment?\" \"Well .\n you ace everything you do.\n And it\u0027s the nickname of a fictional character I have a crush on.\n You remind me of him sometimes.\"\n \"I\u0027m not sure I like you having a crush on anyone but me, fictional or not.\"\n \"You\u0027ll get over it.\"\n Shaking his head, he started toward me.\n \"Like I\u0027ll get over the sumo wrestler you have shadowing me?\" I bit the inside of my cheek to keep from laughing.\n I hadn\u0027t been specific about appearance when I\u0027d asked Clancy to arrange for someone he knew in the Phoenix area to guard Gideon the way Sheila was guarding me.\n I\u0027d just asked for a man and provided a relatively small list of things to intercede with.\n \"Where\u0027s Cary going?\" \"Downstairs to play with the credit I arranged for him.\"\n \"We\u0027re not leaving right away?\" He slowly closed the distance between us.\n There was no mistaking the danger inherent in the way he stalked me.\n It was visible in the set of his shoulders and the gleam in his eyes.\n I might\u0027ve been more worried if the sinuousness of his stride hadn\u0027t been so blatantly sexual.\n \"You on your period?\" I nodded.\n \"Then I\u0027ll just have to come in your mouth.\"\n My brows rose.\n \"Is that right?\" \"Oh, yeah.\"\n His mouth curved.\n \"Don\u0027t worry, angel.\n I\u0027ll take care of you first.\"\n He lunged and caught me up, surging into the bedroom and toppling us onto the bed.\n I gasped and his mouth was on mine, the kiss deep and ravenous.\n I was swept away by his passion and the beloved feel of his weight pressing me into the mattress.\n He smelled so good.\n His skin was so warm.\n \"I missed you,\" I moaned, wrapping my arms and legs around him.\n \"Even though you\u0027re seriously irritating sometimes.\"\n Gideon growled.\n \"You\u0027re the most exasperating, infuriating woman I\u0027ve ever met.\"\n \"Yeah, well, you pissed me off.\n I\u0027m not a possession.\n You can\u0027t - \" \"Yes, you are.\"\n He nipped my earlobe with his teeth, causing a sharp sting that made me cry out.\n \"And yes, I can.\"\n \"Then you are, too.\n And I can, too.\"\n \"So you demonstrated.\n Have any idea how difficult it is to do business with someone when they can\u0027t get within three feet of you?\" I froze, because I\u0027d made the three- feet rule applicable only to women.\n \"Why would someone need to be that close to you?\" \"To point out areas of interest on design schematics spread out in front of me and to fit alongside me within camera range for a teleconference - two things you made very difficult.\"\n Lifting his head, he looked down at me.\n \"I was working.\n You were playing.\"\n \"I don\u0027t care.\n If it\u0027s good for me, it\u0027s good for you.\"\n But I was secretly pleased that Gideon had put up with the inconvenience, just as I had.\n Reaching down, he caught me by the back of the thigh and yanked my legs wider apart.\n \"You\u0027re not going to get a hundred percent equality in this relationship.\"\n \"The hell I\u0027m not.\"\n His hips settled into the opening he\u0027d made.\n He rocked against me, rubbing the thick ridge of his erection against my sex.\n \"You\u0027re not,\" he repeated, his hands pushing into my hair to grip my scalp and hold me in place.\n Rolling his hips, he massaged my hypersensitive clit.\n The seam of his jeans was in the perfect place to stir my ever-simmering lust for him.\n Arousal spiked in my blood.\n \"Stop it.\n I can\u0027t think when you do that.\"\n \"Don\u0027t think.\n Just listen, Eva.\n Who I am and what I\u0027ve built makes me a target.\n You know the score, because you know what it\u0027s like to live with wealth and the attention it attracts.\"\n \"The guy at the bar wasn\u0027t a threat.\"\n \"That\u0027s debatable.\"\n Irritation burned through me.\n It was the perceived lack of trust that bugged me, mostly because he didn\u0027t trust me with whatever secrets he was keeping, and I was dealing with that.\n \"Get off me.\"\n \"I\u0027m comfortable right here.\"\n He hitched his hips, rubbing against me.\n \"I\u0027m pissed at you.\"\n \"I can tell.\"\n He didn\u0027t stop moving.\n \"That won\u0027t stop you from coming.\"\n I shoved at his hips, but he was too heavy to budge.\n \"I can\u0027t when I\u0027m mad!\" \"Prove it.\"\n He was way too smug, which made my anger swell.\n Since I couldn\u0027t turn my head, I closed my eyes, shutting him out.\n He didn\u0027t care.\n He kept on flexing against me.\n The clothes between us and the lack of penetration made me even more aware of the elegant fluidity of his body.\n The man knew how to fuck.\n Gideon didn\u0027t just shove his big dick in and out of a woman.\n He worked her with it, exploiting friction, changing angles and depth of penetration.\n The nuances of his skill were lost when I was writhing beneath him and focused only on the sensations he stoked in my body.\n But I felt them all now.\n I fought against the pleasure, but I couldn\u0027t stifle a moan.\n \"That\u0027s it, angel,\" he coaxed.\n \"Feel how hard I am for you? Feel what you do to me?\" \"Don\u0027t use sex to punish me,\" I complained, my heels digging into the mattress.\n He stilled for a moment, and then his mouth was suckling at my throat, his body undulating as if he were fucking me through our clothes.\n \"I\u0027m not mad, angel.\"\n \"Whatever.\n You\u0027re pushing me around.\"\n \"And you\u0027re driving me insane.\n You know what happened when I realized what you\u0027d done?\" I glared at him through slitted eyes. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reflected-in-you-crossfire-2/page-16.html","bookId":1923,"book":{"id":1923,"title":"Reflected in You (Crossfire #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Reflected in You (Crossfire #2) \n Gideon Cross.
