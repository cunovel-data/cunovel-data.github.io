Get off me.\\n\\n Don\u0027t touch me.\\n\\n Oh, God .\\n\\n please don\u0027t do that to me .\\n\\n don\u0027t hurt me .\\n\\n Ma-ma! Nathan\u0027s hand pressed down on me, squashing my head into the pillow.\\n\\n The more I struggled, the more excited he became.\\n\\n Gasping horrible, nasty words in my ear, he found the tender spot between my legs and shoved into me, groaning.\\n\\n I froze, locking in a vise of horrendous pain.\\n\\n \"Yeah,\" he grunted.\\n\\n \".\\n\\n like it once it\u0027s in you .\\n\\n hot little slut .\\n\\n you like it .\"\\n\\n I couldn\u0027t breathe, my lungs shuddering with sobs, my nostrils plugged by the heel of his palm.\\n\\n Spots danced before my eyes; my chest burned.\\n\\n I fought again .\\n\\n needing air .\\n\\n desperate for air - \"Eva! Wake up!\" My eyes snapped open at the barked command.\\n\\n I heaved myself away from the hands gripping my biceps, gaining my freedom.\\n\\n I clawed away .\\n\\n fighting the sheets that bound my legs .\\n\\n tumbling down .\\n\\n The jolting impact of hitting the floor woke me fully, and an awful sound of pain and fear scraped up through my throat.\\n\\n \"Christ! Eva, damn it.\\n\\n Don\u0027t hurt yourself!\" I sucked in air with deep gulps and scrambled toward the bathroom on all fours.\\n\\n Gideon scooped me up and gripped me to his chest.\\n\\n \"Eva.\"\\n\\n \"Sick,\" I gasped, slapping a hand over my mouth as my stomach roiled.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve got you,\" he said grimly, carrying me with brisk, powerful strides.\\n\\n He took me to the toilet and tossed up the seat.\\n\\n Kneeling beside me, he held my hair back as I heaved, his warm hand stroking up and down my spine.\\n\\n \"Shh .\\n\\n angel,\" he murmured, over and over.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s okay.\\n\\n You\u0027re safe.\"\\n\\n When my stomach was empty, I flushed the toilet and rested my sweat- drenched face on my forearm, trying to focus on anything but the remnants of my dream.\\n\\n \"Baby girl.\"\\n\\n I turned my head to find Cary standing in the threshold of my bathroom, his handsome face marred by a frown.\\n\\n He was fully dressed in loose jeans and a henley, which made me aware that Gideon was fully dressed, too.\\n\\n He\u0027d lost the suit earlier when we\u0027d first come back to my apartment, but he wasn\u0027t wearing the sweats he had put on then.\\n\\n Instead he was in jeans and a black T-shirt.\\n\\n Disoriented by their appearances, I glanced at my watch and saw it was just after midnight.\\n\\n \"What are you guys doing?\" \"I was just coming in,\" Cary said.\\n\\n \"And caught up with Cross on his way up.\"\\n\\n I looked at Gideon, whose concerned frown matched my roommate\u0027s.\\n\\n \"You went out?\" Gideon helped me to my feet.\\n\\n \"I told you I had some things to take care of.\"\\n\\n Until midnight? \"What things?\" \"It\u0027s not important.\"\\n\\n I shrugged out of his hold and went to the sink to brush my teeth.\\n\\n Another secret.\\n\\n How many did he have? Cary appeared at my elbow, his gaze meeting mine in the reflection of my vanity mirror.\\n\\n \"You haven\u0027t had a bad dream in a long time.\"\\n\\n Looking into his worried green eyes, I let him see how worn down I was.He gave my shoulder a reassuring squeeze.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll take it easy this weekend.\\n\\n Recharge.\\n\\n We both need it.\\n\\n You gonna be all right tonight?\" \"I\u0027ve got her.\"\\n\\n Gideon straightened from his perch on the lip of my bathtub, where he\u0027d taken off his boots.\\n\\n \"That doesn\u0027t mean I\u0027m not here.\"\\n\\n Cary pressed a quick kiss to my temple.\\n\\n \"Holler if you need me.\"\\n\\n The look he gave me before he left the room spoke volumes - he wasn\u0027t comfortable with Gideon sleeping over.\\n\\n Truth was, I had some reservations, too.\\n\\n I thought my lingering wariness over Gideon\u0027s sleep disorder was contributing a lot to my wild emotional state.\\n\\n As Cary had recently said, the man I loved was a ticking time bomb, and I shared a bed with him.\\n\\n I rinsed out my mouth and dropped my toothbrush back into its holder.\\n\\n \"I need a shower.\"\\n\\n I\u0027d taken one before I crashed, but now I felt dirty again.\\n\\n Cold sweat clung to my skin and when I closed my eyes, I could smell him - Nathan - on me.\\n\\n Gideon turned on the water, then started stripping, blessedly distracting me with the sight of his gloriously tight body.\\n\\n His muscles were hard and well defined, his build lean yet powerful and elegant.\\n\\n I left my clothes where they fell and stepped beneath the steamy spray with a groan.\\n\\n He entered the stall behind me, brushing my hair aside and pressing a kiss to my shoulder.\\n\\n \"How are you?\" \"Better.\"\\n\\n Because you\u0027re near.\\n\\n His arms wrapped carefully around my waist and he released a shaky exhalation.\\n\\n \"I .\\n\\n Jesus, Eva.\\n\\n Were you dreaming about Nathan?\" I took a deep breath.\\n\\n \"Maybe one day we\u0027ll talk about our dreams, huh?\" He inhaled sharply, his fingertips flexing against my hip.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s like that, is it?\" \"Yeah,\" I muttered.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s like that.\"\\n\\n We stood there for a long moment, surrounded by steam and secrets, physically close yet emotionally distant.\\n\\n I hated it.\\n\\n The urge to cry was overwhelming and I didn\u0027t fight it.\\n\\n It felt good to get it out.\\n\\n All the pressure of the long day seemed to flow out of me as I sobbed.\\n\\n \"Angel .\"\\n\\n Gideon pressed into my back, his arms tight around my waist, soothing me with the protective shield of his big body.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t cry .\\n\\n God.\\n\\n I can\u0027t take it.\\n\\n Tell me what you need, angel.\\n\\n Tell me what I can do.\"\\n\\n \"Wash it away,\" I whispered, leaning into him, needing the comfort of his tender possessiveness.\\n\\n My fingers laced with his against my stomach.\\n\\n \"Make me clean.\"\\n\\n \"You are.\"\\n\\n I sucked in a shuddering breath, shaking my head.\\n\\n \"Listen to me, Eva.\\n\\n No one can touch you,\" he said fiercely.\\n\\n \"No one can get to you.\\n\\n Never again.\"\\n\\n My fingers tightened on his.\\n\\n \"They\u0027d have to get through me, Eva.\\n\\n And that will never happen.\"\\n\\n I couldn\u0027t speak past the ache in my throat.\\n\\n The thought of Gideon facing my nightmare .\\n\\n seeing the man who\u0027d done those things to me .\\n\\n tightened the cold knot that had been sitting in my gut all day.\\n\\n Gideon reached for my shampoo and I closed my eyes, shutting it all out, everything but the man whose sole focus at that moment was me.\\n\\n I waited, breathless, for the feel of his magic fingers.\\n\\n When it came, I reached out to the wall in front of me for balance.\\n\\n With both palms pressed flat against the cool tile, I savored the feel of his fingertips kneading into my scalp and moaned.\\n\\n \"Feel good?\" he asked, his voice low and rough.\\n\\n \"Always.\"\\n\\n I drifted in bliss as he washed and conditioned my hair, shivering lightly as he ran a wide-toothed comb through the soaked strands.\\n\\n I was disappointed when he finished and must have made some sound of regret, because he leaned forward and promised, \"I\u0027m not nearly done.\"\\n\\n I smelled my body wash, then - \"Gideon.\"\\n\\n I arched into his soap-slick hands.\\n\\n His thumbs dug gently into the knots in my shoulders, melting them with the perfect amount of pressure.\\n\\n Then he worked his way down my spine .\\n\\n my buttocks .\\n\\n my legs .\\n\\n \"I\u0027m going to fall,\" I slurred, drunk with pleasure.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll catch you, angel.\\n\\n I\u0027ll always catch you.\"\\n\\n The pain and degradation of my memories washed away beneath the selfless reverence of Gideon\u0027s patient caretaking.\\n\\n More than the soap and water, it was his touch that freed me from the nightmare.\\n\\n I turned around at his urging and looked at him crouched before me, his hands gliding up my calves, his body an amazing display of taut flexing muscle. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reflected-in-you-crossfire-2/page-10.html","bookId":1923,"book":{"id":1923,"title":"Reflected in You (Crossfire #2)","description":"Storyline: Reflected in You (Crossfire #2) \\n Gideon Cross.
