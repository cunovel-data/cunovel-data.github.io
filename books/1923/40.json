It\u0027s what got us signed with Vidal.\" The idea of closure made me smile. \"It\u0027s a beautiful song, and your voice sounds amazing when you sing it. I\u0027m really glad you came up and saw me again before you head out. It means a lot to me that we talked through this.\" \"What if I don\u0027t want to just head out and move on?\" He took a deep breath and released it in a rush. \"You\u0027ve been my muse the last few years, Eva. Because of you, I\u0027ve written the best material the band\u0027s ever had.\" \"That\u0027s very flattering,\" I began. \"We sizzled together. Still do. I know you feel it. The way you kissed me the other night .\" \"That was a mistake.\" My hands clenched beneath the table. I couldn\u0027t deal with more drama. I couldn\u0027t go through another night like Friday. \"And you need to think about the fact that Gideon controls your label. You don\u0027t want any friction there.\" \"Fuck it. What\u0027s he going to do?\" His fingertips drummed onto the table. \"I want another shot with you.\" I shook my head and reached for my purse. \"That\u0027s impossible. Even if I didn\u0027t have a boyfriend, I\u0027m not the right girl for your lifestyle, Brett. I\u0027m too high-maintenance.\" \"I remember,\" he said roughly. \"God, do I remember.\" I flushed. \"That\u0027s not what I meant.\" \"And that\u0027s not all I want. I can be here for you. Look at me now - the band\u0027s on the road, but you and I are together. I can make time. I want to.\" \"It\u0027s not that easy.\" I pulled cash out of my wallet and dropped it on the table. \"You don\u0027t know me. You have no idea what it would mean to have a relationship with me, how much work it would take.\" \"Try me,\" he challenged. \"I\u0027m needy and clingy and insanely jealous. I\u0027d drive you crazy within a week.\" \"You\u0027ve always driven me crazy. I like it.\" His smile faded. \"Stop running, Eva. Give me a chance.\" I met his gaze and held it. \"I\u0027m in love with Gideon.\" His brows rose. Even battered, his face was breathtaking. \"I don\u0027t believe you.\" \"I\u0027m sorry. I have to go.\" I pushed to my feet and moved to pass him. He caught my elbow. \"Eva - \" \"Please don\u0027t make a scene,\" I whispered, regretting my impetuous decision to eat at a popular place. \"You didn\u0027t eat.\" \"I can\u0027t. I need to leave.\" \"Fine. But I\u0027m not giving up.\" He released me. \"I make mistakes, but I learn from them.\" I bent over and said firmly, \"There\u0027s no chance. None.\" Brett stabbed his fork into a slice of his steak. \"Prove it.\" The Bentley was waiting at the curb when I stepped out of the restaurant. Angus climbed out and opened the rear door for me. \"How did you know where I was?\" I asked, unsettled by his unexpected appearance. His answer was to smile kindly and touch the brim of his chauffeur\u0027s hat. \"This is creepy, Angus,\" I complained as I slid into the backseat. \"I don\u0027t disagree, Miss Tramell. I\u0027m just doing my job.\" I texted Cary on the ride back to the Crossfire: Had lunch with Brett. He wants another chance w/me. Cary replied, When it rains it pours . Whole day \u003d royally fucked, I typed. I want a do- over. My phone rang. It was Cary. \"Baby girl,\" he drawled. \"I want to sympathize, I do, but the love triangle thing is just too delicious. The determined rock star and the possessive billionaire. Rawr.\" \"Oh God. Hanging up now.\" \"See you tonight?\" \"Yes. Please don\u0027t make me regret it.\" I hung up to the sound of his laughter, secretly thrilled to hear him sounding so happy. Trey\u0027s visit must have worked wonders. Angus dropped me off at the curb in front of the Crossfire, and I hurried out of the heat into the cool lobby. I managed to catch an open elevator just before the doors closed. There were a half dozen other people in the car with me, forming two groups that chatted among themselves. I stood in the front corner and tried to put my personal life out of my mind. I couldn\u0027t deal with it at work. \"Hey, we passed our floor,\" the girl next to me said. I looked at the needle over the door. The guy nearest the control panel stabbed repeatedly at all the numbers, but none of them lit up . except for the one for the top floor. \"The buttons aren\u0027t working.\" My pulse quickened. \"Use the emergency phone,\" one of the other girls said. The car raced up and the butterflies in my stomach got worse with every floor we passed. The elevator finally came to a gliding stop at the top and the doors opened. Gideon stood on the threshold, his face a gorgeous impassive mask. His eyes were brilliantly blue . and cold as ice. The sight of him took my breath away. No one in the car said a word. I didn\u0027t move, praying the doors would hurry up and close. Gideon reached in, grabbed my elbow, and hauled me out. I struggled, too furious to want anything to do with him. The doors closed behind me and he let me go. \"Your behavior today has been appalling,\" he growled. \"My behavior? What about yours?\" I crossed over to the call buttons and hit the down button. It wouldn\u0027t stay lit. \"I\u0027m talking to you, Eva.\" I glanced at the security doors to Cross Industries and was relieved to see that the redheaded receptionist was away from her station. \"Really?\" I faced him, hating that I could still find him so irresistibly attractive when he was being so ugly. \"Funny how that doesn\u0027t lead to me actually learning anything - like about you going out with Corinne last night.\" \"You shouldn\u0027t be snooping online about me,\" he bit out. \"You\u0027re deliberately trying to find something to get upset about.\" \"So your actions aren\u0027t the problem?\" I shot back, feeling the pressure of tears at the back of my throat. \"Just my finding out about them is?\"His arms crossed. \"You need to trust me, Eva.\" \"You\u0027re making that impossible! Why didn\u0027t you tell me that you were going out to dinner with Corinne?\" \"Because I knew you wouldn\u0027t like it.\" \"But you did it anyway.\" And that hurt. After all we\u0027d talked about over the weekend . after he\u0027d said that he understood how I felt . \"And you went out with Brett Kline knowing I wouldn\u0027t like it.\" \"What did I tell you? You\u0027re setting the precedent for how I handle my exes.\" \"Tit for tat? What a remarkable show of maturity.\" I stumbled back from him. There was none of the Gideon I knew in the man facing me. It felt as if the man I loved had disappeared and the man standing in front of me was a total stranger in Gideon\u0027s body. \"You\u0027re making me hate you,\" I whispered. \"Stop it.\" Something passed briefly over Gideon\u0027s face, but it was gone before I could identify it. I let his body language do the talking for him. He stood far from me, with his shoulders stiff and his jaw tight. My heart bled and my gaze dropped. \"I can\u0027t be around you right now. Let me go.\" Gideon moved to the other bank of elevators and pushed the call button. With his back to me and his attention on the indicator arrow, he said, \"Angus will pick you up every morning. Wait for him. And I prefer that you eat lunch at your desk. It\u0027s best if you\u0027re not running around right now.\" \"Why not?\" \"I have a lot of things on my plate at the moment - \" \"Like dinner with Corinne?\" \" - and I can\u0027t be worrying about you,\" he went on, ignoring my interruption. \"I don\u0027t think I\u0027m asking too much.\" Something was wrong. \"Gideon, why won\u0027t you talk to me?\" I reached out and touched his shoulder, only to have him jerk away as if I\u0027d burned him. More than anything else, his rejection of my touch wounded me deeply. \"Tell me what\u0027s going on. If there\u0027s a problem - \" \"The problem is that I don\u0027t know where the hell you are half the time!\" he snapped, turning to scowl at me as the elevator doors opened. \"Your roommate is in the hospital. Your dad is coming to visit. Just . focus on that.\" I stepped into the elevator with burning eyes. Aside from pulling me out of the elevator when it first arrived, Gideon hadn\u0027t touched me. He hadn\u0027t run his fingertips down my cheek or made any attempt to kiss me. And he made no mention of wanting to see me later, skipping right over the rest of the day to tell me about Angus waiting for me in the morning. I\u0027d never been so confused. I couldn\u0027t figure out what was happening, why there was suddenly this huge gulf between us, why Gideon was so tense and angry, why he didn\u0027t seem to care that I\u0027d had lunch with Brett. Why he didn\u0027t seem to care about anything at all. The doors started to close. Trust me, Eva.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reflected-in-you-crossfire-2/page-40.html","bookId":1923,"book":{"id":1923,"title":"Reflected in You (Crossfire #2)","description":"Storyline: Reflected in You (Crossfire #2) Gideon Cross.
