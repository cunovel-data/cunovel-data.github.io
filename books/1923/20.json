Now I\u0027m a subcreature?\" I pressed my cleft against the hard ridge of his cock and rolled my hips.\n \"You\u0027re whatever I want you to be, remember?\" Gideon gripped my rib cage and tipped his head back.\n \"And what\u0027s that?\" \"Mine.\"\n I nipped his throat with my teeth.\n \"All mine.\"\n I couldn\u0027t breathe.\n I tried to scream, but something blocked my nose .\n covered my mouth.\n A high-pitched moan was the only sound to escape, my frantic calls for help trapped inside my mind.\n Get off me.\n Stop it! Don\u0027t touch me.\n Oh, God .\n please don\u0027t do that to me.\n Where was Mama? Ma-ma! Nathan\u0027s hand covered my mouth, mashing my lips.\n The weight of his body pressed down on me, squashing my head into the pillow.\n The more I fought, the more excited he became.\n Panting like the animal he was, he lunged into me, over and over .\n trying to shove himself into me.\n My panties were in the way, protecting me from the tearing pain I\u0027d lived through too many times to count.\n As if he\u0027d read my mind, he growled in my ear, \"You haven\u0027t felt pain yet.\n But you will.\"\n I froze.\n Awareness hit me like a bucket of ice water.\n I knew that voice.\n Gideon.\n No! My blood roared in my ears.\n Sickness spread through my gut.\n Bile flooded my mouth.\n It was worse, so much worse, when the person trying to rape you was someone you trusted with everything you had.\n Fear and fury blended in a potent rush.\n In a moment of clarity, I heard Parker\u0027s barked commands.\n I remembered the basics.\n I attacked the man I loved, the man whose nightmares blended with mine in the most horrific way.\n We were both sexual-abuse survivors, but in my dreams I was still a victim.\n In his, he\u0027d become the aggressor, viciously determined to inflict the same agony and humiliation on his attacker as he himself had suffered.\n My stiffened fingers rammed into Gideon\u0027s throat.\n He reared back with a curse and shifted, and I slammed my knee between his legs.\n Doubled over, he fell away from me.\n I rolled out of bed and hit the floor with a thud.\n Scrambling to my feet, I threw myself toward the door to the hallway.\n \"Eva!\" he gasped, awake and aware of what he\u0027d almost done to me in his sleep.\n \"God.\n Eva.\n Wait!\" I bolted out the door and ran into the living room.\n Finding a darkened corner, I curled into a ball and struggled to breathe, my sobs echoing through the apartment.\n I pressed my lips to my knee when the light came on in my bedroom and didn\u0027t move or make a sound when Gideon stepped into the living room an eternity later.\n \"Eva? Jesus.\n Are you okay? Did I .\n hurt you?\" Atypical sexual parasomnia was what Dr.\n Petersen called it, a manifestation of Gideon\u0027s deep psychological trauma.\n I called it hell.\n And we were both trapped in it.\n His body language broke my heart.\n His normally proud bearing was weighted with defeat, his shoulders slumped and his head bowed.\n He was dressed and carrying his overnight bag.\n He stopped by the breakfast bar.\n I opened my mouth to speak; then I heard a metallic clink against the stone countertop.\n I\u0027d stopped him the last time; I\u0027d made him stay.\n This time, I didn\u0027t have it in me.\n This time, I wanted him to go.\n The barely audible latching of the front door lock reverberated through me.\n Something inside me died.\n Panic welled.\n I missed him the moment he was gone.\n I didn\u0027t want him to stay.\n I didn\u0027t want him to go.\n I don\u0027t know how long I sat there in the corner before I found the strength to stand and move to the couch.\n I vaguely registered that dawn was lighting the night sky when I heard the distant sound of Cary\u0027s cell phone ringing.\n Shortly after that, he came running into the living room.\n \"Eva!\" He was on me in a minute, crouching in front of me with his hands on my knees.\n \"How far did he go?\" I blinked down at him.\n \"What?\" \"Cross called.\n Said he\u0027d had another nightmare.\"\n \"Nothing happened.\"\n I felt a hot tear roll down my cheek.\n \"You look like something happened.\n You look .\"\n I caught his wrists when he surged to his feet with a curse.\n \"I\u0027m okay.\"\n \"Shit, Eva.\n I\u0027ve never seen you look like this.\n I can\u0027t stand it.\"\n He took a seat beside me and pulled me into his shoulder.\n \"Enough is enough.\n Cut him off.\"\n \"I can\u0027t make that decision now.\"\n \"What are you waiting for?\" He forced me back to glare at me.\n \"You\u0027re going to wait too long and then this won\u0027t be just another bad relationship, it\u0027ll be one that permanently fucks you up.\"\n \"If I give up on him, he\u0027ll have no one.\n I can\u0027t - \" \"That\u0027s not your problem.\n Eva .\n Goddamn it.\n It\u0027s not your responsibility to save him.\"\n \"It\u0027s - You don\u0027t understand.\"\n I wrapped my arms around him.\n Burying my face in his shoulder, I cried.\n \"He\u0027s saving me.\"\n I threw up when I found Gideon\u0027s key to my apartment lying on the breakfast bar.\n I barely made it to the sink.\n When my stomach was empty, I was left with pain so agonizing it was crippling.\n I clung to the edge of the counter, gasping and sweating, crying so hard I wondered how I\u0027d make it through another five minutes, let alone the rest of the day.\n The rest of my life.\n The last time Gideon had returned my keys to me, we\u0027d broken up for four days.\n It was impossible not to think that repeating the gesture signified a more permanent break.\n What had I done? Why hadn\u0027t I stopped him? Talked to him? Made him stay? My smartphone signaled an incoming text.\n I stumbled to my purse and dug it out, praying it was Gideon.\n He\u0027d talked to Cary three times already, but he\u0027d yet to contact me.\n When I saw his name on the screen, a sweet, sharp ache pierced my chest.\n I\u0027m working from home today, his message read.\n Angus will be waiting out front to give you a ride to work.\n My stomach cramped again with dread.\n It had been a tremendously difficult week for both of us.\n I could understand why he\u0027d just given up.\n But that understanding was wrapped in a gut-gnawing fear so cold and insidious that goose bumps swept up my arms.\n My fingers shook as I texted him back: Will I see you tonight? There was a long pause, long enough that I was about to demand a yes or no answer when he sent: Don\u0027t count on it.\n I have my appt with Dr.\n Petersen and a lot of work to do.\n My grip tightened on my phone.\n It took me three attempts before I was able to type: I want to see you.\n For the longest time, my phone sat silently.\n I was reaching for my landline in a near panic when he replied: I\u0027ll see what I can do.\n Oh God .\n Tears made it hard for me to see the letters. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reflected-in-you-crossfire-2/page-20.html","bookId":1923,"book":{"id":1923,"title":"Reflected in You (Crossfire #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Reflected in You (Crossfire #2) \n Gideon Cross.
