Stop them!\" His pale blue eyes softened.\\n\\n \"He knows when to stop, Eva.\"\\n\\n \"Are you shitting me?!\" He looked over my shoulder.\\n\\n \"Mr.\\n\\n Ricci, if you would, please.\"\\n\\n The next thing I knew, I was slung over Arnoldo\u0027s shoulder and en route to the limo.\\n\\n Lifting my head, I saw the circle of bystanders close in with my absence, blocking my view.\\n\\n I screamed my frustration and pounded at Arnoldo\u0027s back, but it didn\u0027t faze him.\\n\\n He climbed right into the back of the limo with me, and when Shawna hopped in a moment later, Angus shut the door as if everything was totally fucking normal.\\n\\n \"What the hell are you doing?\" I snapped at Arnoldo, scrambling for the door handle as the limo rolled smoothly into motion.\\n\\n It wouldn\u0027t open and no matter what I did, I couldn\u0027t get it to unlock.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s your friend! You\u0027re just going to leave him like that?\" \"He\u0027s your boyfriend.\"\\n\\n The calm neutrality in Arnoldo\u0027s voice cut me deep.\\n\\n \"And you are the one who left him like that.\"\\n\\n I slumped back into the seat, my stomach churning and my palms damp.\\n\\n Gideon .\\n\\n \"You\u0027re the Eva in the song \u0027Golden,\u0027 aren\u0027t you?\" Shawna asked quietly, from her position on the opposite bench seat.\\n\\n Arnoldo started, obviously surprised by the connection.\\n\\n \"I wonder if Gideon - \" He sighed.\\n\\n \"Of course he knows.\"\\n\\n \"That was a long time ago!\" I said defensively.\\n\\n \"Not long enough, apparently,\" he pointed out.\\n\\n Desperate to get to Gideon, I couldn\u0027t sit still.\\n\\n My feet tapped, my body battling against restlessness so intense I felt like crawling out of my skin.I\u0027d hurt the man I loved and through him, another man who\u0027d done nothing more than be himself.\\n\\n And I had no good explanation for it.\\n\\n Looking back, I had no idea what had come over me.\\n\\n Why hadn\u0027t I pulled away sooner? Why had I kissed Brett back? And what was Gideon going to do about it? The thought that he might break up with me triggered overwhelming panic.\\n\\n I was sick with worry.\\n\\n Was he hurt? God .\\n\\n the thought of Gideon in pain ate at me like acid.\\n\\n Was he in trouble? He\u0027d assaulted Brett.\\n\\n My palms went damp when I remembered Cary\u0027s news that his clusterfuck buddy also wanted to press assault charges.\\n\\n Gideon\u0027s life was spiraling out of control - because of me.\\n\\n At some point he was going to realize I wasn\u0027t worth the trouble.\\n\\n I glanced at Shawna.\\n\\n She was looking out the window pensively.\\n\\n I\u0027d blown her awesome night.\\n\\n And Arnoldo\u0027s, too.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry.\"\\n\\n I sighed miserably.\\n\\n \"I screwed up everything.\"\\n\\n She looked at me and shrugged, then offered a sympathetic smile that made my throat burn.\\n\\n \"No big.\\n\\n I had a great time.\\n\\n I hope you work things out for the best.\"\\n\\n The best thing for me was Gideon.\\n\\n Had I blown that? Had I thrown away the most important thing in my life over some weird, inexplicable head trip?I still felt Brett\u0027s mouth on mine.\\n\\n I scrubbed at my lips, wishing I could erase the last half hour of my life as easily.\\n\\n My anxiety made it feel like it took an eternity to drive Shawna home.\\n\\n I got out and gave her a hug on the sidewalk in front of her apartment building.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" I said again, for both earlier and then, because I was dying to get to Gideon - wherever he was - and I was afraid my impatience showed.\\n\\n I wasn\u0027t sure I\u0027d ever forgive Angus or Arnoldo for taking me away when and how they did.\\n\\n Arnoldo hugged Shawna and told her that she and Doug had a standing reservation for Tableau One anytime.\\n\\n I softened a little toward him.\\n\\n He\u0027d taken good care of her all night.\\n\\n We climbed back into the limo and set off for the restaurant.\\n\\n I curled into a darkened corner of the seat and cried silently, unable to contain the flood of despair overwhelming me.\\n\\n When we arrived at the restaurant, I used my tank top to dry my face.\\n\\n Arnoldo stopped me from getting out.\\n\\n \"Be gentle with him,\" he scolded, staring hard at my face.\\n\\n \"I have never seen him the way he is with you.\\n\\n I can\u0027t say you are worthy of him, but you can make him happy.\\n\\n I saw that myself.\\n\\n Do it or walk.\\n\\n Don\u0027t fuck with his head.\"\\n\\n I couldn\u0027t speak past the lump in my throat, so I nodded, hoping he could see in my eyes how much Gideon meant to me.\\n\\n Everything.\\n\\n Arnoldo disappeared into the restaurant.\\n\\n Before Angus shut the door, I slid forward on the seat.\\n\\n \"Where is he? I need to see him.\\n\\n Please.\"\\n\\n \"He called.\"\\n\\n Angus\u0027s face was kind, which made me start crying again.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m taking you to him now.\"\\n\\n \"Is he okay?\" \"I don\u0027t know.\"\\n\\n I pushed back into the seat, feeling physically ill.\\n\\n I barely paid attention to where we were headed, my only thought being that I needed to explain.\\n\\n I needed to tell Gideon that I loved him, that I\u0027d never leave him if he\u0027d still have me, that he was the only man I wanted, the only man who set my blood on fire.\\n\\n Eventually, the car slowed and I looked out, realizing we\u0027d returned to the amphitheater.\\n\\n As I peered out the window, searching for him, the door behind me opened, startling me, and I shifted around to see Gideon duck inside and settle on the opposite bench from me.\\n\\n I lurched toward him.\\n\\n \"Gideon - \" \"Don\u0027t.\"\\n\\n His voice whipped with anger, sending me recoiling and falling on my rear.\\n\\n The limo set into motion, jostling me.\\n\\n Crying, I watched him pour a glass of amber liquor at the bar and toss it back.\\n\\n I waited on the floorboards, my stomach churning with fear and grief.\\n\\n He refilled his glass before shutting the bar and dropping back in his seat.\\n\\n I wanted to ask him if Brett was okay or badly hurt.\\n\\n I wanted to ask how Gideon was, if he was injured or fine.\\n\\n But I couldn\u0027t.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t know if he would take the questions the wrong way and assume my concern for Brett meant more than it did.\\n\\n His face was impassive, his eyes hard as sapphires.\\n\\n \"What is he to you?\" I swiped at the tears streaming down my face.\\n\\n \"A mistake.\"\\n\\n \"Then? Or now?\" \"Both.\"\\n\\n His lip curled in a sneer.\\n\\n \"You always kiss your mistakes like that?\" My chest heaved as I tried to stem the need to sob.\\n\\n I shook my head violently.\\n\\n \"You want him?\" he asked tightly, before taking another drink.\\n\\n \"No,\" I whispered.\\n\\n \"I only want you.\\n\\n I love you, Gideon.\\n\\n So much it hurts.\"\\n\\n His eyes closed and his head fell back.\\n\\n I took the opportunity to crawl closer, needing to bridge the physical distance between us, at least.\\n\\n \"Did you come for me when I had my fingers inside you, Eva? Or because of his goddamn song?\" Oh my God .\\n\\n How he could doubt - ?I made him doubt.\\n\\n I did that.\\n\\n \"You.\\n\\n You\u0027re the only one who can get to me like that.\\n\\n Make me forget where I am.\\n\\n Make it so I don\u0027t care who\u0027s around or what\u0027s happening as long as you\u0027re touching me.\"\\n\\n \"Isn\u0027t that what happened when he kissed you?\" Gideon\u0027s eyes opened and focused on me.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s had his dick in you.\\n\\n He\u0027s fucked you .\\n\\n blown his load inside you.\"\\n\\n I cringed away from the horrible bitterness in his tone, the vicious nastiness.\\n\\n I knew just how he felt.\\n\\n How badly the mental images could sting and claw until you felt like you were going mad.\\n\\n In my mind, he and Corinne had fucked dozens of times while I watched in sick, jealous fury.\\n\\n He straightened suddenly, leaning forward to rub his thumb roughly across my lips.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s had your mouth.\"\\n\\n I grabbed his glass and drank what was left in it, hating the harsh taste and searing burn.\\n\\n I swallowed by force of will alone.\\n\\n My stomach roiled, protesting.\\n\\n The heat of the alcohol spread outward from my gut.\\n\\n Gideon sagged back into the seat, his arm thrown across his face.\\n\\n I knew he was still seeing me kissing Brett.\\n\\n Knew it was eating a hole in his mind.\\n\\n Dropping the glass on the floor, I surged between his legs and fumbled with his button fly.\\n\\n He caught my fingers in an iron grip but kept his eyes covered with his forearm.\\n\\n \"What the fuck are you doing?\" \"Come in my mouth,\" I begged. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reflected-in-you-crossfire-2/page-29.html","bookId":1923,"book":{"id":1923,"title":"Reflected in You (Crossfire #2)","description":"Storyline: Reflected in You (Crossfire #2) \\n Gideon Cross.
