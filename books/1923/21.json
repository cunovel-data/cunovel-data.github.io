if he still thought it was worth it to try.\n God knew I did.\n \"Ready?\" Parker asked, tossing his empty bottle in the recycle bin.\n \"Bring it.\"\n He grinned.\n \"There she is.\"\n Parker still worked me over, but it wasn\u0027t from lack of trying on my part.\n I was in it every step of the way, venting my frustration with good, healthy exercise.\n The few victories I managed to earn spurred my determination to fight for my rocky relationship, too.\n I was willing to put in the time and effort to be there for Gideon, to be a better and stronger person so we could get through our issues.\n And I was going to tell him that, whether he wanted to hear it or not.\n When my hour was over, I cleaned up and waved good-bye to my classmates and then shoved at the push bar of the exit door and stepped out into the still-warm evening air.\n Clancy had already brought the car around to the door and was leaning against the fender in a pose that only a moron would think was casual.\n Despite the heat, he wore a jacket, which concealed his sidearm.\n \"Things moving along?\" He straightened to open the door for me.\n As long as I\u0027d known him, he\u0027d kept his dark blond hair in a military crew cut.\n It added to the impression of his being a very somber man.\n \"Working on it.\"\n Sliding into the backseat, I told Clancy to drop me off at Gideon\u0027s.\n I had my own key and I was prepared to use it.\n On the drive over, I wondered if Gideon had gone to see Dr.\n Petersen for his appointment or if he\u0027d blown it off.\n He\u0027d agreed to individual therapy only because of me.\n If I wasn\u0027t part of the equation anymore, he might not see any reason to make the effort.\n I entered the understated and elegant lobby of Gideon\u0027s apartment building and checked in with the front desk.\n It wasn\u0027t until I was alone in his private elevator that the nerves really hit me.\n He\u0027d placed me on his approved list weeks before, a gesture that meant so much more to him and me than it would to others because Gideon\u0027s home was his sanctuary, a place he allowed few visitors to see.\n I was the only lover he\u0027d ever entertained there and the only person, aside from his household staff, who had a key.\n Yesterday I wouldn\u0027t have doubted my welcome, but now .\n I exited into a small foyer decorated with checkerboard marble tiles and an antique console bearing a massive arrangement of white calla lilies.\n Before I unlocked his front door, I took a deep breath, steeling myself for however I might find him.\n The one previous time he\u0027d attacked me in his sleep, it had shattered him.\n I couldn\u0027t help but fear what the second time had done to him.\n I was terrified that his parasomnia might be the wedge that drove us apart.\n But the moment I entered his apartment, I knew he wasn\u0027t home.\n The energy that thrummed through a space when he occupied it was markedly absent.\n Lights that were activated by my movements came on when I entered the expansive living room, and I forced myself to settle in as if I belonged there.\n My room was down the hall and I went to it, pausing on the threshold to absorb the weirdness of seeing my bedroom replicated in Gideon\u0027s place.\n The duplication was uncanny, from the color on the walls to the furniture and fabrics, but its existence was more than a little unnerving.\n Gideon had created it as my safe room, a place for me to run to when I needed some space.\n I supposed I was running to it now, in a way, by using it instead of his.\n Setting my workout bag and purse on the bed, I showered and changed into one of the Cross Industries T- shirts Gideon had set aside for me.\n I tried not to think about why he still wasn\u0027t home.\n I\u0027d just poured a glass of wine and turned on the living room television when my smartphone rang.\n \"Hello?\" I answered, unfamiliar with the number on the nameless Caller ID.\n \"Eva? It\u0027s Shawna.\"\n \"Oh, hey, Shawna.\"\n I tried not to sound disappointed.\n \"I hope it\u0027s not too late to call.\"\n I looked at the screen of my phone, noting that it was almost nine o\u0027clock.\n Jealousy mingled with my concern.\n Where was he? \"No worries.\n I\u0027m just watching TV.\"\n \"Sorry I missed your call last night.\n I know it\u0027s short notice, but I wanted to see if you\u0027d be up for going to a Six- Ninths concert on Friday.\"\n \"A what concert?\" \"Six-Ninths.\n You haven\u0027t heard of \u0027em? They were indie until late last year.\n I\u0027ve been following them for a while and they gave their e-mail list first dibs, so I scored tickets.\n Thing is, everyone I know likes hip-hop and dance pop.\n Not to say you\u0027re my last hope, but .\n well, you\u0027re my last hope.\n Tell me you like alt rock.\"\n \"I like alt rock.\"\n My phone beeped.\n Incoming call.\n When I saw it was Cary, I let it go to voice mail.\n I didn\u0027t think I\u0027d be on the phone with Shawna too long and I could call him back.\n \"How did I know that?\" She laughed.\n \"I\u0027ve got four tickets if you\u0027ve got someone you\u0027d like to bring along.\n Meet up at six? Grab something to eat first? The show starts at nine.\"\n Gideon walked in just as I answered, \"You\u0027ve got a date.\"\n He stood just inside the door with his jacket slung over one arm, the top button of his dress shirt undone, and a briefcase in his hand.\n His mask was in place, showing no emotion whatsoever at finding me sprawled on his couch in his T-shirt with a glass of his wine on his table and his television on.\n He raked me with a head-to-toe glance, but nothing flickered in those beautiful eyes.\n I suddenly felt awkward and unwanted.\n \"I\u0027ll get back to you about the other ticket,\" I told Shawna, sitting up slowly so I didn\u0027t flash him.\n \"Thanks for thinking of me.\"\n \"I\u0027m just glad you\u0027re coming! We\u0027re going to have a great time.\"\n We agreed to talk the next day and hung up.\n In the interim, Gideon set his briefcase down and tossed his jacket over the arm of one of the gilded chairs flanking the ends of the glass coffee table.\n \"How long have you been here?\" he asked, yanking the knot of his tie loose.\n I stood.\n My palms grew damp at the thought that he might kick me out.\n \"Not long.\"\n \"Have you eaten?\" I shook my head.\n I hadn\u0027t been able to eat much all day.\n I\u0027d gotten through the session with Parker courtesy of a protein drink I\u0027d picked up during my lunch hour.\n \"Order something.\"\n He walked past me toward the hallway.\n \"Menus are in the kitchen drawer by the fridge.\n I\u0027m going to grab a quick shower.\"\n \"Do you want something?\" I asked his retreating back.\n He didn\u0027t stop or look at me.\n \"Yes.\n I haven\u0027t eaten, either.\"\n I\u0027d finally settled upon a local deli boasting organic tomato soup and fresh baguettes - figuring my stomach could maybe handle that - when my phone rang again.\n \"Hey, Cary,\" I answered, wishing I were home with him and not about to face a painful breakup.\n \"Hey, Cross was just here looking for you.\n I told him to go to hell and stay there.\"\n \"Cary.\"\n I sighed.\n I couldn\u0027t blame him; I\u0027d do the same thing for him.\n \"Thanks for letting me know.\"\n \"Where are you?\" \"At his place, waiting for him.\n He just showed.\n I\u0027ll probably be home sooner rather than later.\"\n \"You kicking him to the curb?\" \"I think that\u0027s on his agenda.\"\n He exhaled audibly.\n \"I know it\u0027s not what you\u0027re ready for, but it\u0027s for the best.\n You should call Dr.\n Travis ASAP.\n Talk it out with him. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reflected-in-you-crossfire-2/page-21.html","bookId":1923,"book":{"id":1923,"title":"Reflected in You (Crossfire #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Reflected in You (Crossfire #2) \n Gideon Cross.
