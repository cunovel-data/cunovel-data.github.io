Business or pleasure?\" \"R and R.\n You?\" Daniel had an interesting tattoo written in a foreign language on his right biceps, and I admired it.\n He wasn\u0027t traditionally good-looking, but he had confidence and poise, two things I found more attractive in a man than just his physical features.\n \"Work.\"\n I shot a look at his swimming trunks.\n \"I\u0027ve got the wrong job.\"\n \"I sell - \" \"Excuse me.\"\n We both turned to face the woman who had intruded on our conversation.\n She was a compact brunette dressed in a dark polo shirt embroidered with both her name - Sheila - and Cross Towers and Casino.\n The earpiece in her ear and the utility belt around her waist gave her away as security.\n \"Miss Tramell.\"\n She greeted me with a nod.\n My brows rose.\n \"Yes?\" \"There\u0027s a server who can take your order by your cabana.\"\n \"Cool, thanks.\n But I don\u0027t mind waiting here.\"\n When I didn\u0027t move, Sheila turned her attention to Daniel.\n \"If you\u0027ll move to the other end of the bar, sir, the bartender will see that your next drinks are on the house.\"\n He gave a cursory nod, then smiled winningly at me.\n \"I\u0027m good here, too, thanks.\"\n \"I\u0027m afraid I\u0027ll have to insist.\"\n \"What?\" His smile turned into a scowl.\n \"Why?\" I blinked at Sheila as realization sank in.\n Gideon had me under watch.\n And he thought he could control what I did from a distance.\n Sheila returned my look, her face impassive.\n \"I\u0027ll escort you back to your cabana, Miss Tramell.\"\n For a minute, I considered making her day hell, maybe grabbing Daniel and kissing him senseless just to send a message to my overbearing boyfriend, but I managed to restrain my temper.\n She was only doing what she was paid to do.\n It was her boss who needed the kick in the ass.\n \"Sorry, Daniel,\" I said, flushing with embarrassment.\n I felt like a scolded kid and that really irked me.\n \"It was nice meeting you.\"\n He shrugged.\n \"If you change your mind .\"\n I felt Sheila\u0027s gaze on my back as I preceded her to my lounger.\n Abruptly, I faced her.\n \"So, is getting hit on the only time you\u0027re instructed to step in? Or do you have a list of situations?\" She hesitated a moment, then sighed.\n I could only imagine what she must think of me, the pretty blond piece of ass who couldn\u0027t be trusted to be out mingling in public.\n \"There\u0027s a list.\"\n \"Of course there is.\"\n Gideon wouldn\u0027t leave anything to chance.\n I wondered when he\u0027d worked on the list, if he\u0027d compiled it just since I mentioned Vegas or if he\u0027d had it on hand.\n Maybe it was a list he had formed while he was with other women.\n Maybe he\u0027d written it for Corinne.\n The more I thought about it, the angrier I got.\n \"Un-fucking-believable,\" I complained to Cary when she\u0027d stepped a discreet distance away, as if that action alone would be enough to make me forget she was hovering.\n \"I\u0027ve got a babysitter.\"\n \"What?\" I told him what happened and watched his jaw tighten.\n \"That\u0027s crazy, Eva,\" he snapped.\n \"No shit.\n And I\u0027m not putting up with it.\n He\u0027s got to learn that relationships don\u0027t work that way.\n And after all the crap he gave me about trust.\"\n I collapsed on my lounger.\n \"How much does he trust me, if he\u0027s got to have someone shadowing me to chase strangers away?\" \"I\u0027m not down with this, Eva.\"\n He sat up and swung his legs over the side of his chair.\n \"This isn\u0027t okay.\"\n \"You think I don\u0027t know that? And what\u0027s with her being a woman? Nothing against my gender and tough jobs.\n I\u0027m just wondering if he expects her to follow me into ladies\u0027 rooms or just doesn\u0027t trust a guy to watch me.\"\n \"Are you serious? Why the hell are you sunbathing instead of chewing him a new one?\" The idea I\u0027d been toying with fully formed in my mind.\n \"I\u0027m plotting.\"\n \"Oh?\" His mouth curved in a wicked grin.\n \"Do tell.\"\n I picked my smartphone up from the little mosaic-topped table between us and scrolled through my contacts until I found Benjamin Clancy - my stepfather\u0027s personal bodyguard.\n \"Hey, Clancy.\n It\u0027s Eva,\" I greeted him when he answered after the first ring.Cary\u0027s eyes widened behind his shades.\n \"Ooh .\"\n Pushing to my feet, I mouthed, I\u0027m going upstairs.\n He nodded.\n \"Everything\u0027s fine,\" I said, in answer to Clancy\u0027s query.\n I waited until I\u0027d ducked indoors and knew Sheila was several paces behind me and still outside.\n \"Listen, I have a favor to ask you.\"\n I\u0027d just ended my call with Clancy when another call came in.\n I grinned when I saw the Caller ID and answered with an exuberant, \"Hi, Daddy!\" He laughed.\n \"How\u0027s my girl?\" \"Causing trouble and enjoying it.\"\n I spread my sarong out on a dining room chair and took a seat.\n \"How are you?\" \"Stopping trouble from happening and occasionally enjoying it.\"\n Victor Reyes was an Oceanside, California street cop, which was why I\u0027d chosen to attend SDSU.\n My mom had been going through a rough patch with husband number three and I\u0027d been in a rebellious phase, making my own life hell as I tried to forget what Nathan had done to me for so long.\n Moving out of my mom\u0027s suffocating orbit had been one of the best decisions I\u0027d ever made.\n My dad\u0027s quietly unshakeable love for me, his only child, had changed my life.\n He gave me much-needed freedom - within clearly defined limits - and arranged for me to see Dr.\n Travis, which led to the start of my long journey of recovery and my friendship with Cary.\n \"I miss you,\" I told him.\n I loved my mom dearly and know she loved me back, but my relationship with her was a rocky one and it was just so easy with my dad.\n \"You might be happy about my news, then.\n I can come out and see you in about two weeks - the week after this upcoming one - if that works for you.\n I don\u0027t want to put you out.\"\n \"Oh my God, Dad.\n You could never put me out.\n I\u0027d love to see you!\" \"It\u0027ll be a short trip.\n I\u0027d come in on the red-eye Thursday night and fly out again Sunday evening.\"\n \"I\u0027m stoked! Yay! I\u0027ll make plans.\n We\u0027ll have a blast.\"\n My dad\u0027s soft chuckle sent warmth flowing through me.\n \"I\u0027m coming to see you, not New York.\n Don\u0027t go crazy with any sightseeing or anything.\"\n \"Don\u0027t worry.\n I\u0027ll make sure we have lots of downtime.\n And you\u0027ll get to meet Gideon.\"\n Just the thought of the two of them together made my tummy flutter.\n \"Gideon Cross? You said nothing was going on there.\"\n \"Yeah.\"\n I wrinkled my nose.\n \"We\u0027d hit a rough spot at the time.\n I thought we were over.\"\n There was a pause.\n \"Is it serious?\" I paused, too, shifting restlessly.\n My dad was a trained observer; he\u0027d see right away that Gideon and I had tension between us - sexual and otherwise.\n \"Yes.\n It\u0027s not always easy.\n It\u0027s a lot of work - I\u0027m a lot of work - but we\u0027re both making the effort.\"\n \"Does he appreciate you, Eva?\" My dad\u0027s voice was gruff and far too serious.\n \"I don\u0027t care how much money he has; you don\u0027t have anything to prove to him.\"\n \"It\u0027s not like that!\" I stared at my wriggling pedicured toes and realized the meeting would be more complicated than just a protective father being introduced to his daughter\u0027s new boyfriend.\n My dad had issues with rich men, thanks to my mom.\n \"You\u0027ll see how it is when you meet him.\"\n \"All right.\"\n Skepticism colored his voice.\n \"Really, Dad.\"\n I couldn\u0027t begrudge him his concern, since it\u0027d been my self-destructive run with not-so-good- for-me guys that had led him to finding Dr.\n Travis.\n He\u0027d especially had trouble with a lead singer for whom I\u0027d been little more than a groupie and a tattoo artist whom my dad had pulled over to find him getting a blowjob while driving - and not from me.\n \"Gideon\u0027s good for me.\n He gets me.\"\n \"I\u0027ll keep an open mind, okay? And I\u0027ll e-mail you a copy of my itinerary when I book the flight.\n How\u0027s everything else going?\" \"We just started working on a campaign for blueberry-flavored coffee.\"\n Another pause.\n \"You\u0027re kidding.\"\n I laughed.\n \"If only.\n Wish us luck trying to sell that! I\u0027ll be sure to stock some up for you to try.\"\n \"I thought you loved me.\"\n \"With all my heart.\n How\u0027s your love life going? Did your date go well?\" \"Yeah .\n it wasn\u0027t bad.\"\n Snorting, I asked, \"Are you going to see her again?\" \"That\u0027s the plan so far.\"\n \"You\u0027re a font of information, Dad.\"\n He chuckled again and I heard his favorite chair creak as he shifted.\n \"You don\u0027t really want to know about your old man\u0027s love life.\"\n \"True.\"\n Although I did sometimes wonder what his relationship had been like with my mom. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/reflected-in-you-crossfire-2/page-15.html","bookId":1923,"book":{"id":1923,"title":"Reflected in You (Crossfire #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Reflected in You (Crossfire #2) \n Gideon Cross.
