{"id":99696,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"Dropping at a stomach-punching speed towards the earth. Freefall. Surrounded by blue sky, clouds far below but getting closer every second. I glance desperately at the tramp, praying to spot the hump of a parachute pack. But there\u0027s nothing. He\u0027s falling the same way I am, with only one way of stopping-the hard way. I scream and flap frantically with my arms. Crazily I wish I was back in the plane. At least I stood a glimmer of a chance with the demons. This is death for certain. \"Boy!\" the tramp shouts cheerfully. \"Are you having fun?\" \"We\u0027re going to die!\" I roar, clothes rippling madly on my limbs, the scream of the wind ice-cold in my ears. \"Not today,\" the tramp chortles, then angles his body and glides closer towards me. \"We can fly.\" \"You\u0027re a lunatic!\" I shriek. \"Perhaps,\" he grins, then arcs his body up, pulls away from me, swoops over and beneath me and draws up on the other side. \"Or maybe not.\" \"Let me hold on to you!\" I yell, grabbing for him. He pulls away. \"No. It\u0027s time you learnt to fend for yourself. You\u0027re a creature of magic. Use your power.\" \"I can\u0027t,\" I howl. \"Of course you can,\" he tuts as if he was a teacher and we were debating an argument in class, safe on the ground, instead of hurtling towards it at a speed I don\u0027t even want to think about. \"We\u0027re going to die,\" I shout again. \"I\u0027m not,\" he says. \"You won\u0027t either if you focus. But you\u0027d better be quick,\" he adds as we enter a thick bank of cloud, then burst through it a second or two later. \"You haven\u0027t much time.\" He points at the earth, which I can see clearly now we\u0027ve broken through the cloud. I start to scream senselessly, thoughts wild, gravity pulling me to my high-impact doom. Then the tramp asks casually, \"Are you cold?\" The craziness of the question draws a furious response. \"What sort of a nut are you? I\u0027m falling to my death and you\u0027re discussing the temperature!\" \"Answer me,\" he says calmly. \"Are you cold?\" \"No. But what the-\" \"At this height, don\u0027t you think you should be? It was in the region of minus forty Celsius on the wing of the aeroplane. Any normal person would have felt the icy bite immediately. You didn\u0027t because magic kept you warm. It can also keep you aloft-if you direct it.\" \"What must I do?\" I moan, the landscape filling my vision, surely no more than half a minute away from a bone-crunching collision. \"Visualise a bird,\" the tramp says. \"Think of the way it flies, how it soars out of a dive with the slightest tilt of its wings. Don\u0027t picture your arms as wings or anything like that. Just imagine a bird and fix it in your thoughts.\" I do as he says. Close my eyes and think of a swallow swooping and soaring. I\u0027ve seen them fly many times, when walking home from school or looking out of my bedroom window, glimpsed through the uppermost branches of the forest. They make it look simple-nudge out a wing, duck or pull up their head, catch the wind currents, sail them as if it was the most natural thing in the world. My head rises. The roar of the wind lessens. A new sensation. Not one of falling, but of... I open my eyes. I\u0027m moving away from the earth, arms by my side, legs straight, head facing the clouds, the tramp by my side. Flying. \"There,\" the tramp says with a wicked little grin. \"Simple, aye?\" Flying high. A creature of the sky. Laughing and hollering with delight. Flying on my front, back, sides-however I please. Somersaulting mid-air, a far greater rush than any roller coaster. \"This is amazing!\" I yell at the tramp, who flies nearby. \"How am I doing it?\" \"Magic,\" he says. \"But I\u0027m not trying. I\u0027m not casting spells.\" \"True magicians don\u0027t need spells most of the time.\" I stare at him, stunned. \"But I\u0027m not a magician.\" \"No?\" He nods at the earth far below. \"Then how do you explain this?\" \"But Dervish said... I\u0027ve never... Bartholomew Garadex!\" I throw the name out desperately. \"You\u0027re different to Bartholomew,\" the tramp says. \"Different to every magician I\u0027ve ever known or heard about. But you\u0027re a magician none the less. You draw your power directly from the universe, like the Demonata.\" Mention of the demons reminds me of the plane and its doomed passengers. \"We have to go back!\" I shout, cursing myself for flying around happy and carefree while Lord Loss and his familiars wreak havoc. \"We have to save the people on the plane.\" The tramp sighs. \"Dead, all of them.\" \"No! They can\u0027t be! We have to-\" \"They\u0027re dead,\" the tramp says stiffly. \"And even if they aren\u0027t, what could we do?\" \"Fight!\" I roar. \"Against Lord Loss?\" He shakes his head. \"I\u0027m powerful, boy, and so are you, but Lord Loss is a demon master. We wouldn\u0027t last long in a battle with him.\" \"We have to try,\" I whisper, thinking of all those men, women and children. Picturing the Demonata and Juni Swan at savage work. \"If we abandon them...\" \"We\u0027ve already abandoned them,\" the tramp grunts. \"The choice was taken when I pulled you out. Everyone on that aeroplane is dead and it has crashed-or will shortly-destroying the evidence.\" \"You let them die,\" I gasp. The tramp shrugs. \"I would have saved them if I could. I\u0027ve devoted my life to protecting humanity from the Demonata. But some battles you can\u0027t win. Some you can\u0027t even fight.\" Flying in silence. Thinking about what happened and what the tramp said. Cold inside and scared. Unable to get the faces of the people-the dead-out of my mind. Yet a big part of me is secretly glad we didn\u0027t go back, that the tramp spared me another run-in with the demons. \"This is insane,\" I mutter, looking at the world beneath. \"Who are you? What were you doing on the plane? Why have you been following me? I thought you were one of the Lambs. I know nothing about you. I need-\" \"Soon,\" the tramp hushes me. \"I\u0027ll answer all your questions once we\u0027re safe on the ground. For now, just fly.\" And since there\u0027s no point arguing, I tuck my arms in tighter, pick up speed, trail the tramp through the air and try-unsuccessfully-to push the faces of the dead from my thoughts. We fly for hours, mostly above the clouds where people on the ground can\u0027t see us. I spot the occasional plane, but the tramp always steers us clear. A shame-I love the thought of gliding up to one and tapping on the windows, scaring the living daylights out of the passengers and crew. I\u0027ve no idea where we are. I didn\u0027t ask Juni where we were going when we set off and I don\u0027t know how long I was asleep, so I can\u0027t judge how far from home we might have been when the demons attacked. Juni... Rage seethes up inside me every time I think about her. I trusted her. I thought she was on my side, that she loved me like a mother. And all the time she was playing me for a fool, setting me up for Lord Loss, cutting me off from Dervish. I want to quiz the tramp about her. Find out where she comes from, how she operates, where I can find her-so I can track her down and burn her for the evil witch she is. But this isn\u0027t the right time. I have loads of questions for the tramp. So much I want to know, that I need to find out. Hell, I haven\u0027t even asked his name yet! Finally, five or six hours after I bailed out of the plane, the tramp guides me down. The land is barren desert, more rocky than sandy. No signs of human life-it\u0027s been the better part of an hour since I saw any kind of house. \"This is the complicated part,\" the tramp says as we come in to land. \"The easiest way is to hover a bit above the ground, then stop thinking about birds. After a few seconds you\u0027ll fall.\" \"Can\u0027t we touch down?\" I ask. \"I can, but I\u0027ve had a lot of practice. If you try it, you\u0027ll probably hit hard and break a leg or arm.\" He spreads his arms and drifts down, landing lightly on his feet. I\u0027m tempted to copy him, to prove I\u0027m nimbler than he gives me credit for. But it\u0027s been a long day and the last thing I want is to break any bones. So I float to within a metre of the rocky floor, then empty my head of images of birds. For a couple of seconds nothing happens. Then I drop suddenly, stomach lurching. I hit the ground awkwardly, landing face first in the dust. Sitting up, I splutter and wipe dirt and grit from my cheeks, then get to my feet and look around. We\u0027re in the middle of nowhere. Some rocky outcrops and hills, a few rustling cacti, nothing else. \"Where are we?\" \"Home,\" the tramp says and starts walking towards one of the hills. \"Whose home?\" I ask, hurrying after him. \"Mine.\" \"And you are...?\" He stops and looks back, surprised. \"You don\u0027t know?\" \"Should I?\" \"Surely Dervish told...\" He trails off into silence, then laughs. \"All that time in the air, you didn\u0027t know who you were with?\" \"I was going to ask, but it didn\u0027t seem like the right moment,\" I huff. The tramp shakes his head. \"I\u0027m Beranabus.\" The name sounds familiar, but I can\u0027t place it. \"Beranabus what?\" I ask. \"Just Beranabus,\" he says, then starts walking again. \"Come. We have much to discuss, but it will hold. I never feel safe in the open.\" With a nervous glance around, I hasten after the shabbily dressed man. Several minutes later we come to the mouth of a cave. Not having had the best experience of caves recently, I pause and peer suspiciously into the shadows. \"It\u0027s fine,\" Beranabus assures me. \"This is a safe place, protected by its natural position and the strongest spells I could muster. You have nothing to fear.\" \"That\u0027s easily said,\" I grunt, unconvinced. Beranabus smiles. He has crooked, stained teeth. This close I can see that his small eyes are grey and his skin is pale beneath a covering of grime and dirt. He\u0027s wearing an old, dusty suit. The only fresh thing about him is a small posy of flowers jutting out of one of his buttonholes. \"If I wanted to harm you,\" he says, \"I could have done so already, with far less effort than it would take on the ground. That should be self-evident.\" \"I know,\" I mutter. \"It\u0027s just... I don\u0027t like caves.\" \"With good reason,\" he says understandingly. \"But this isn\u0027t like the cave in Carcery Vale. You\u0027ll be safe here. I promise.\" I hesitate a moment longer, then shrug. \"What the hell,\" I grunt and push ahead of Beranabus, acting like I couldn\u0027t care less. The cave only runs back four or five metres, then stops. I look for a way out, studying the walls and floor, but I can\u0027t see any. \"Are you like a monk who doesn\u0027t believe in material possessions?\" I ask. \"No,\" Beranabus says, squeezing past me. He touches the ground and mutters a few words of magic. A hole appears. There\u0027s a rope ladder attached to the wall at one side, leading down into the dark. I move to the edge of the hole and look down nervously. There are torches set in the walls, so it\u0027s not as dark as it seemed at first. But it runs a long way down and I can only vaguely see the bottom. \"I thought you said a magician didn\u0027t need to cast spells,\" I say, delaying the moment when I have to descend. \"Most of the time,\" Beranabus reminds me. \"There are occasions when even the strongest of us must focus our magical energy with words.\" He sits and swings his legs into the hole. Turns, grabs the ladder and starts down. Looks up at me before his head bobs beneath my feet. \"This will close in a few minutes. If you\u0027re coming, get a move on.\" \"Just waiting for you to get out of my way,\" I retort. Then, when his head\u0027s clear, I ignore the butterflies in my stomach, sit, turn and climb down the swaying ladder after him. The hole closes with a small grinding noise before I hit the ground. I try not to think about the fact that I\u0027m shut off from the world. At the base I step clear of the ladder and find myself in a large, bright cave. There are chairs, a sofa, a long table at one end with a vase of flowers on it, a few statues, books, chests of drawers, other bits and pieces. There\u0027s also a fire in the middle of the cave, by which a bald, dark-skinned boy sits warming his hands. \"I\u0027m back,\" Beranabus calls. \"I noticed,\" the boy replies without looking around. \"I\u0027ve brought a guest.\" The boy\u0027s head turns a fraction. He has bright blue eyes and a sour expression. \"I thought you were going to kill him.\" I stiffen as Beranabus scowls. \"I said I might have to kill him.\" \"What do you-\" I start to ask angrily. \"Later,\" Beranabus soothes me, then points to a blanket spread out on the ground close to the wall. \"Get some sleep. I will too. Later we can have a long discussion over a hot meal.\" \"You think I can sleep after all that\u0027s happened?\" I snort. \"I know you can,\" Beranabus says. \"Magic. All you have to do is imagine it and you\u0027ll sleep like a baby.\" \"What if I don\u0027t want to?\" \"You\u0027re exhausted. You need rest, so you can focus on our conversation and ask all the questions I\u0027m sure are welling up inside you. You wouldn\u0027t be able to process my answers in your current state.\" I don\u0027t want to sleep-I want to tear straight into the explanations-but what he says makes sense. Just keeping my eyelids open is a major effort at the moment. \"One thing first,\" I mutter. \"Dervish and Bill-E-are they OK?\" Beranabus shrugs. \"I think so.\" \"You\u0027re not sure?\" \"No. But Lord Loss and Juni-\" For some reason he sneers as he says her name. \"-don\u0027t know where we went once we left the plane. I doubt Juni would risk going back in case we got there before her.\" \"You\u0027ll warn Dervish?\" I ask. \"About Juni working with Lord Loss?\" \"I can\u0027t contact him immediately,\" Beranabus says, \"but I\u0027ll get word to him as soon as I can. He\u0027ll have to fend for himself until then.\" That\u0027s not satisfactory, but it\u0027s the best he\u0027s going to offer. So, since I\u0027m worn out, and there\u0027s nothing I could do even if I was on top form, I stumble to the blanket and lie down fully clothed. I doubt I can fall asleep as easily as Beranabus expects, but as soon as I close my eyes and think about it, I find myself going under. Seconds later I\u0027m comatose.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/demon-apocalypse-the-demonata-6/page-2.html","bookId":2180,"book":{"id":2180,"title":"Demon Apocalypse (The Demonata #6)","description":"Storyline: Demon Apocalypse (The Demonata #6) One boy\u0027s life ripped to shreds before his eyes...
