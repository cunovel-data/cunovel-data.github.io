{"id":99701,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"\"Impossible!\" Beranabus keeps croaking. \"Impossible!\" He\u0027s striding around the cave, hair and eyes even wilder than normal, clutching the drawing of the girl to his chest, muttering away to himself, occasionally bursting out with another round of, \"Impossible! Impossible!\"\n Kernel and I have drawn together by the fire, temporarily united by our uncertainty. \"Has he ever gone off like this before?\" I whisper.\n \"No,\" Kernel replies quietly. \"He often talks to himself, but I\u0027ve never seen him so agitated.\"\n \"Do you know who the girl is?\"\n Kernel shakes his head. \"Just some old drawing that he gets out every now and then and moons over.\"\n \"Beranabus said she died sixteen hundred years ago.\"\n \"I heard.\"\n \"Do you think he knew her? Was he alive then?\"\n \"No.\" Kernel frowns. \"He can\u0027t have been. We can live a long time, battling the Demonata in their universe, even a few hundred years. But no human can live that long. At least that\u0027s what Beranabus taught me...\n Beranabus stops pacing, whirls and fixes his stare on me. \"You!\" he shouts. \"Come here!\" I glance at Kernel for support. \"Don\u0027t dither! Get over here now!\"\n Since I don\u0027t want to enrage him any further, I edge across but keep out of immediate reach. Beranabus holds the drawing up. His hands are shaking. \"How sure are you?\" he growls.\n \"It\u0027s her,\" I tell him. \"The girl in the cave. I\u0027m certain.\"\n \"Would you stake your life on it?\" he snarls.\n \"No,\" I say hesitantly. \"But it is her. You don\u0027t forget a face like that. It\u0027s not every day a person speaks to you from within the heart of a rock.\"\n Beranabus lowers the drawing. Turns it around so he can study the face again. \"You say she\u0027s alive?\" he asks, voice low.\n I shrug. \"She spoke to me. But it wasn\u0027t a real face. It was a cross between flesh and stone. She could have been some sort of ghost, I guess.\"\n \"Of course,\" Beranabus says. \"But a ghost imprisoned there... trapped all this time...\" His eyes shoot up. \"Tell me what she said.\"\n \"I can\u0027t. I didn\u0027t understand her. She spoke a different language.\"\n \"Don\u0027t be stupid! You can...\" He stops and gets his breathing under control. \"First things first. Tell me the whole story. Everything this time. About the cave, what you saw and heard. Leave nothing out.\"\n I don\u0027t want to go through it again, but he\u0027s not going to tell me anything until I do, so I quickly trot out the story, filling in all the details I skipped the first time. Seeing the face in the rock. The eyes opening. Later, when the girl spoke to me. In the cave, the night of my turning, when she screamed at me and seemed to be trying to warn me.\n \"Warn you of what?\" Beranabus asks.\n \"Maybe that Juni was a traitor. Or of the danger Bill-E was in.\"\n \"Perhaps,\" Beranabus mutters. \"There are blood ties between you, which might account for her interest in your predicament, but to break out of the rock and make herself heard must have required a huge amount of energy and effort. Why would she do that just to save your lives?\"\n He\u0027s not expecting an answer, so I don\u0027t try to provide one. Instead I pick up on something else he said and ask stiffly, \"What blood ties?\"\n He waves a hand as though it\u0027s nothing. \"The girl was called Bec. A distant ancestor of yours.\"\n \"Ancestor?\"\n \"A distant one,\" he repeats. \"She was a priestess... a magician. A brave, true, selfless girl.\"\n \"Did you know her?\" Kernel asks. He\u0027s slightly behind us, listening closely. \"Were you alive then?\"\n \"I\u0027d be a real Methuselah if so,\" Beranabus says. He looks at the drawing again and frowns. \"I need to know what she said. She might have simply been trying to help you, but I think there\u0027s more to it. We need to study her words.\"\n \"But I told you I couldn\u0027t understand her. I don\u0027t speak her language.\"\n \"I do,\" Beranabus says, then gestures to the chair behind the desk. \"I\u0027m going to teach you another remembering spell, like the one we used to prove you didn\u0027t kill your brother\u0027s grandparents. But with this one you\u0027ll repeat everything the girl said. I\u0027ll be able to translate.\"\n I sit. Beranabus clears an area of the table, then lays the drawing down gently, so it\u0027s facing me. \"Look into her eyes,\" he says softly. \"Forget everything that\u0027s happened recently. Let your mind drift back.\" He gives me a minute, then says, \"Repeat after me.\"\n I mimic Beranabus\u0027s words carefully. As the spell develops, the lines on the paper shimmer. I\u0027m startled, but I\u0027ve seen a lot more incredible stuff in my time, so I don\u0027t lose concentration. The lines begin to move. The face doesn\u0027t bulge out of the page the way it projected from the rocks, but it comes alive. The eyes flicker and the lips part. The girl talks. No sounds come, just the motions. But as the spell concludes and Beranabus stops talking, I find my own lips moving in time with the drawing\u0027s. Only it\u0027s not my voice-it\u0027s the girl\u0027s.\n I speak swiftly, anxiously, the muscles of my throat hurting from having to form such unusual words. I spot Kernel listening with a frown, unable to interpret. But Beranabus understands perfectly. And the more I say, the more his face pales and he trembles.\n Before I finish, the elderly magician sinks to the floor and stares at me, appalled. I want to ask him what the girl said, but I can\u0027t. My lips continue to move and the dead girl\u0027s words spill out. I\u0027m repeating myself from the beginning.\n Beranabus groans and covers his ears with his hands. \"No,\" he wheezes. \"Gods be damned. No!\"\n \"Beranabus?\" Kernel says, approaching his master cautiously. \"What\u0027s wrong?\"\n \"His fault!\" Beranabus shrieks, pointing an accusing finger at me. \"If he\u0027d told me when he first came here...\" He shakes his head and curses. I carry on talking, unable to stop. I\u0027m afraid he\u0027s going to leave me this way, that I\u0027ll warble on like this forever.\n Finally, rising slowly, Beranabus growls something and the words cease. My mouth closes. I rub my aching jaws and throat, staring at the magician, wondering what I\u0027ve done to incense him.\n \"Damn you, Grubitsch Grady,\" he says bitterly, shooing me out of his chair and lowering himself into it, picking up the drawing and cradling it to his chest. There are angry, hopeless tears in his eyes. \"Damn the day you came into this world. If I\u0027d known the trouble you\u0027d cause, I\u0027d have killed you at birth, you meddling, cowardly, destructive brat.\"\n \"Beranabus!\" Kernel gasps as my insides clench tight.\n \"It\u0027s true!\" Beranabus shouts. \"I stood up for the wretched fool, but I shouldn\u0027t have. I should have just... just...\" He stops, closes his eyes and moans. \"No. You didn\u0027t know what you were doing. I can\u0027t blame you.\"\n \"I don\u0027t care what you think of me,\" I snap, angry and ashamed. \"Just tell me what she said, you horrible old buzzard.\"\n Beranabus opens his eyes and smiles faintly. \"That\u0027s more like it, boy. Spirit.\" His smile disappears. \"Bec was trying to warn you, but she wasn\u0027t interested in saving your life. The stakes were much higher. She...\"\n He clears his throat, then continues lifelessly. \"I don\u0027t know how she wound up where she is, or how she managed to communicate with you, but her soul has been trapped in that cave since she died, torn between life and death, between our universe and the Demonata\u0027s. I\u0027ve never seen that before. Ghosts, aye, but only pale shades of those who died. This is different. She somehow defied the laws of death and her soul remains intact. It shouldn\u0027t...\" He coughs and shakes his head, then continues.\n \"Bec is able to peer into the demon universe from where she\u0027s trapped. She\u0027s been observing the Demonata for centuries. She became aware long ago of a powerful demon master trying to open a tunnel to this world. When she sensed you clearing the entrance to the cave, she was afraid the creature would learn of it and restore the ancient tunnel. That\u0027s why she tried to warn you off. Later she learnt of a more direct threat, which is why she appeared so desperate the last time she established contact.\n \"I made a fatal error. I thought Lord Loss wasn\u0027t interested in opening a tunnel between the two universes. But he\u0027s changed his views. When Dervish told Juni about the cave, her master decided to kill two birds with one stone. His plan was to slaughter you, Dervish and your brother-or take you back to his own realm to torture-then open the tunnel, clearing the way for the ranks of demons to cross.\"\n Beranabus pauses. Kernel and I are staring at him, struck dumb.\n \"Juni must have made a sacrifice after Dervish revealed the cave to her,\" he goes on. \"It takes a few weeks for the blood of a sacrificed victim to prime the tunnel walls. The spells of opening can\u0027t be cast until then. I was guarding the cave closely, but somehow she got in and killed someone without my knowledge.\n \"Lord Loss could have opened the tunnel at any time, but he decided to do it on a full moon, when there was more magic in the air. Tapping into the power of the moon, he could complete the spells within a few hours. That way, if I discovered him while he was at work, he\u0027d only have to hold me at bay for that short time.\n \"Being a lover of neatness, he planned to kill or abduct you three and open the tunnel on the same night. Unfortunately for him, your magic burst to the surface and derailed things. He missed his chance to get even with the Grady clan at the cave. Since settling his score with you before he opened the floodgates was important to him, he pushed his plans back by a month.\"\n \"Then we still have time!\" I gasp. \"It\u0027s not too late. We know what he\u0027s going to do. We\u0027ll return to the cave and fight.\"\n \"We?\" Kernel says sarcastically.\n \"Yes! I\u0027ll fight to save Dervish and Bill-E. I don\u0027t care what those monsters throw at us. When it\u0027s family, it\u0027s different.\"\n \"You really think you can choose not to be a coward if and when it suits you?\" Kernel jeers.\n Beranabus interrupts wearily before I can retort. \"It doesn\u0027t matter. You\u0027re arguing about nothing. The time for heroics has passed.\"\n \"What are you talking about?\" I say edgily.\n \"It\u0027s difficult to track time here,\" Beranabus says softly, \"but not impossible. I can reach out and make a quick check on the heavens when I wish. I did that while Bec was speaking. You miscalculated, Grubbs. It\u0027s been seven weeks since I rescued you from the aeroplane.\"\n I start to shiver. \"But... no... maybe Lord Loss delayed again. He wanted to kill me before he opened the tunnel, but I\u0027m still alive. Maybe-\"\n \"No,\" Beranabus stops me. \"Once I\u0027d established the date, I cast my senses further afield. When there\u0027s a rip of great magnitude between universes a magician can detect it. If the spells I\u0027d cast at the cave worked, I\u0027d have known earlier. I should have renewed them, but it seemed like there was no rush. I wouldn\u0027t have made that mistake a hundred years ago. I\u0027m getting so old...\"\n Beranabus sighs and his head drops. \"The demons crossed as planned. They\u0027ve had three weeks to stabilise, multiply and spread. Your town is theirs. Probably your country too. Dervish... your brother... everybody else you know in Carcery Vale...\" He finishes in an awful whisper which fills me with a dread beyond any I\u0027ve ever experienced. \"The Demonata have had their way with them. They\u0027re all dead now-and probably millions more besides.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/demon-apocalypse-the-demonata-6/page-8.html","bookId":2180,"book":{"id":2180,"title":"Demon Apocalypse (The Demonata #6)","description":"Storyline: \n Demon Apocalypse (The Demonata #6) \n One boy\u0027s life ripped to shreds before his eyes...
