{"id":99706,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"Beranabus has entered the hole, but only advanced to the point where it widens into the shaft. He\u0027s squatting there, eyes closed, sensing the cave beneath, determining exactly who and what we have to fight.\\n\\n I wish we\u0027d travelled back another few days. We could have called on the Disciples for support. But Beranabus said we couldn\u0027t have come back any further. Because we were riding the wave of energy generated by the opening of the tunnel, we could only follow it back to its origin. He likened it to coming to the end of a train line-when you run out of track, that\u0027s it, end of ride.\\n\\n There\u0027s been no sign of Bec. I\u0027ve kept a close eye on the rocks and listened for her strange whispers, but she hasn\u0027t shown. I know Beranabus is concerned for her. He thinks she might have perished to help send us back, sacrificed herself for our sake. I don\u0027t see the big deal if she did-she was dead already!-but I don\u0027t say that to Beranabus. That girl seems to be the one person in the world he gives a damn about. I doubt he\u0027d appreciate wisecracks at her expense.\\n\\n Kernel is walking around, hands by his sides, trying to navigate like a bat. Only instead of emitting radar beams (or whatever bats emit), he sends out magical impulses, which bounce back, letting him know what\u0027s around him. At least that\u0027s the theory-but with all the trees he\u0027s crashed into during the last few minutes, I\u0027m not sure it works.\\n\\n \"Ouch!\" Kernel bumps into another low-hanging branch and steps back, rubbing his head.\\n\\n \"Why don\u0027t you give it a rest?\" I snap. \"You\u0027ll poke-\"\\n\\n I brake to a halt. I\u0027d been about to say he\u0027d poke an eye out if he wasn\u0027t careful, but I guess it\u0027s a bit late for warnings like that.\\n\\n \"I have to learn,\" Kernel mutters. \"Beranabus needs me. There are demons to kill.\"\\n\\n I walk over to him, take his left arm and gently guide him clear of the trees. His courage fills me with awe and shame. Sure, I found the guts to pitch in when there was no other option, but this is bravery of a different kind. He\u0027s just lost his eyes, yet here he is, determined to carry on fighting. In his shoes I\u0027d be moaning like a baby, full of self-pity, seizing the opportunity to take a back seat and keep out of trouble.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll direct you,\" I promise. \"I\u0027ll be your eyes in the cave. Focus on your magic. I\u0027ll tell you where to aim it when the time\u0027s right.\"\\n\\n \"Thanks,\" he says, smiling faintly. \"But I might as well practise while we\u0027re waiting. It can\u0027t hurt and it keeps my mind off what\u0027s happened. Besides, I think I\u0027m getting the hang of it now.\" Prising himself free, he starts walking again, arms rigid, face composed, senses alert.\\n\\n \"Ouch!\"\\n\\n Scrabbling sounds. Beranabus emerges, brushing dirt and small stones off his unprotected skin. He doesn\u0027t look too worried-happy even, in a guarded kind of way. \"It\u0027s better than I dared hope,\" he says. \"Lord Loss and Juni are there, some of his familiars-the three we encountered on the plane-and Dervish and Bill-E. But that\u0027s all, unless others are masking their presence, which is unlikely. I think we only have five enemies to deal with.\" He makes a clicking noise with his tongue. \"Or seven.\"\\n\\n \"Meaning what?\" I snap.\\n\\n \"We don\u0027t know where Dervish and Bill-E stand.\"\\n\\n \"Of course we do,\" I retort. \"They\u0027re on our side.\"\\n\\n \"Probably. But we mustn\u0027t count on it. We don\u0027t know how far into their minds Juni wormed herself. If they\u0027ve fallen under her spell, they might be acting on the demon master\u0027s behalf.\"\\n\\n \"Never,\" I growl.\\n\\n Beranabus shrugs. \"I won\u0027t argue. Just be aware of the threat. I\u0027m not saying we go down there and blow their heads off. But we might have to knock them about a bit.\"\\n\\n \"I know Dervish and Bill-E,\" I say tightly. \"They wouldn\u0027t betray us, no matter how strong the spell.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t be naive,\" Beranabus barks, then calls Kernel in close. \"Will you be all right down there or are you just going to get in our way?\"\\n\\n I think it\u0027s hugely insensitive of him to speak to his blind assistant like that, but Kernel only smiles. \"I\u0027ll be fine. Grubbs will give me a helpful shove in the right direction. I can\u0027t do much, but I can make a nuisance of myself.\"\\n\\n \"As long as you\u0027re a nuisance for them, not us,\" Beranabus grunts, then lowers his voice. \"Let\u0027s not get overly confident. There might be only five of them, but they\u0027re a deadly quintet. Lord Loss is more powerful than any of us. Juni\u0027s a match for Kernel even with eyes-she\u0027s certainly stronger than him now. And the familiars are dangerous too. Let\u0027s not forget we\u0027re an old man, his blind assistant and a kid who could do anything under pressure.\"\\n\\n \"You sure know how to steady a guy\u0027s nerves before a fight,\" I note sarcastically.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not here to make uplifting speeches,\" Beranabus replies. \"We have a good chance to win. The odds are far better than they were before. But we have to be sharp. We can\u0027t afford any mistakes. We\u0027ve been handed a second chance-there won\u0027t be a third. We\u0027ve seen what the consequences are if we lose. So let\u0027s stay focused and give it the very best we have. And remember, if we lose, we die, and everybody else in the world will too.\"\\n\\n He starts to rise, then stops. \"I almost forgot the most important point.\" He chuckles at himself. \"I\u0027m too old and senile to protect the world any longer. If we get through this, it\u0027ll be time to invest in a pair of slippers and find some quiet corner of the globe where I can...\"\\n\\n He coughs. \"Sorry. Lost my train of thought. What was I saying?\"\\n\\n \"The most important point,\" Kernel reminds him patiently.\\n\\n \"Aye. The key.\" He taps the ground to signify the importance of his next few words. \"I explained earlier how the tunnel was opened. One of Lord Loss\u0027s human allies made a sacrifice in the cave and now has to join with the rock, to create the opening. Unless there\u0027s somebody down there I don\u0027t know about, that person-the key-must be the woman who calls herself Juni Swan.\"\\n\\n \"Couldn\u0027t it be Artery or one of the other familiars?\" I ask.\\n\\n \"No. It has to be a human. Those are the rules.\"\\n\\n \"Rules can change,\" Kernel says. \"According to Bec, you were wrong about the demons being sucked back to their own universe if the tunnel was closed again.\"\\n\\n \"Aye,\" Beranabus growls irritably, \"but she didn\u0027t mention anything about this rule changing. Besides, we saw Lord Loss and his familiars during the fight. Juni\u0027s the only one who wasn\u0027t present.\"\\n\\n \"It could be Dervish or the boy,\" Kernel suggests.\\n\\n I stiffen, but before I can respond, Beranabus says, \"No. If they\u0027re under the woman\u0027s spell, they only succumbed recently. Lord Loss planned to open the tunnel during the night of the previous full moon. That means the sacrifice had been made some weeks before. Dervish and the boy were definitely in control of their senses then. So it has to be Juni. She\u0027s our primary target. If we kill her, we win.\"\\n\\n \"Can\u0027t Lord Loss use another human instead?\" I ask.\\n\\n \"No. Only the one who made the sacrifice can serve as the key. He could try again later and get someone else to make another sacrifice. But if we beat him tonight, we\u0027ll take steps to ensure he never has that option.\\n\\n \"Juni\u0027s the one we go for. Her companions will do everything they can to protect her. We\u0027ll have to fight them, but we mustn\u0027t let them distract us. Juni is the target. The others don\u0027t matter.\\n\\n \"So, you know what we have to do? Are you ready for one more battle, the most important ever? Are you primed to go boldly into the breach and grind these demons into the dirt?\" He grabs my right hand and Kernel\u0027s left. \"Are you with me, boys, all the way to the glorious, victorious end?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s more like it,\" I grin.\\n\\n \"Exactly what you want to hear before you step into the gladiatorial pit,\" Kernel agrees.\\n\\n We enjoy the moment, smiling at one another. (Kernel smiles a little off-centre, at a nearby tree.) Then we face the entrance to the cave and take a decisive step forward.\\n\\n \"Hold it!\" I gasp, ruining the mood, but struck by a sudden thought which I can\u0027t let pass.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s wrong?\" Beranabus asks.\\n\\n \"Nothing. I mean... I don\u0027t know if you can... it\u0027s no big deal, but...\" I nod at my naked flesh. \"I don\u0027t want to face them like this. You couldn\u0027t conjure up some clothes, could you?\"\\n\\n Beranabus stares at me in disbelief-then laughs. \"The things you worry about! But, in a way, you\u0027re right. One should always go into battle suitably clad.\" He waves a hand regally and the trees rustle overhead. I have the sensation of being wrapped up tight by rough blankets. Looking down, I see that I\u0027m clad from neck to ankles in a suit of green, brown, red and yellow leaves, as are Beranabus and Kernel.\\n\\n \"The best I can do in a pinch,\" Beranabus says. \"The material won\u0027t hold for long, but it should see us through the fight.\"\\n\\n \"Perfect,\" I smile, shaking my arms to make sure I\u0027m not bound too tightly. Then we face the hole, take a step forward, on to the slope, and down.\\n\\n The shaft feels narrower than before. The rock\u0027s hot to the touch and it seems to throb with magical energy. I climb silently in the darkness, searching for toeholds and fingerholds, careful not to send any pebbles tumbling in case the noise alerts the demons.\\n\\n I hate this. No excitement at the thought of the battle to come. Just sheer terror. If there was any way to avoid it, I\u0027d be out of here in a flash. But there are no alternatives. It\u0027s fight to the death or surrender this world and everyone I care about to the Demonata. I\u0027d like to think I\u0027m a hero, but the truth is I\u0027m just doing what I have to. There isn\u0027t a choice.\\n\\n Can I kill Juni if the opportunity falls my way? I\u0027m not certain. I despise her, maybe even more than Lord Loss. He\u0027s a demon, born to be evil, but she made a conscious decision to betray her people. At the same time, she\u0027s human. It wouldn\u0027t be like killing a demon. I don\u0027t know if I could do it. Hopefully I won\u0027t have to. Beranabus is the man for that job, and I imagine he\u0027ll relish the task of terminating the treacherous Miss Swan. But if things don\u0027t work out that way... if I come face-to-face with her... if it falls to me to finish her off...\\n\\n I drive the thoughts away. No point worrying about it. I\u0027ll just have to play this out and hope for the best. I\u0027ve got to go in there focused on the fight, confident of victory, not filled with doubt.\\n\\n I concentrate on the climb and our crab-like descent, hand by hand, foot by foot, slowly, carefully, edging ever closer to the demons below.\\n\\n We reach the bottom and group together on the solid cave floor. I can see light ahead of us. Soft, blue, unnatural. Three distinct, separate sounds-someone chanting.\\n\\n Occasional growls and snapping noises. Whimpering and moaning.\\n\\n Beranabus checks that we\u0027re ready, then advances. I keep a few steps behind, slightly to his right so I can see ahead of him, guiding Kernel by his leaf-clad arm. I stub my toes on rocks with almost every step I take, but that\u0027s a minor pain, easily ignored.\\n\\n We enter the main cave and the scene unfolds before us. Juni and Lord Loss are in front of the crack close to the waterfall, the crack I made. Momentary guilt-have I inadvertently helped the demons? But it doesn\u0027t last. Logic tells me not to worry. They could have created a similar opening without much effort.\\n\\n A few metres behind Juni and her master, Dervish and Bill-E are kneeling, arms bound by ropes, gags in mouths. Artery, Femur and Spine are dancing around them, cackling, making sudden lunges, teeth snapping, claws extended-then pulling away before making contact. Bill-E\u0027s the one whimpering and moaning, trying to squirm away from the demons. Dervish is kneeling upright, glaring hatefully at Lord Loss and Juni, beaten but defiant.\\n\\n Instant relief-Dervish and Bill-E are innocent. They haven\u0027t been bewitched by Juni. They\u0027re victims, not adversaries. A weight lifts from my heart. Whether or not I can kill Juni, there\u0027s no way I could have harmed my uncle or brother, even if they\u0027d been working in league with the demons.\\n\\n \"Good evening, all!\" Beranabus booms, startling me almost as much as the others in the cave. Lord Loss, his familiars and Juni whirl round. Dervish and Bill-E\u0027s heads twist as far as the ropes allow. \"I trust we\u0027re not late,\" Beranabus says, striding forward, saluting Dervish. \"Got delayed en route. You\u0027d never believe our story if we told you.\"\\n\\n The rabbit-shaped Femur snarls and crouches, meaning to use its powerful hind legs to leap across the cave at Beranabus and splatter him with acid.\\n\\n \"Wait,\" Lord Loss stops the familiar. He taps Juni\u0027s left arm with one of his eight hands and nods at the crack. She shoots us a hateful glance, then faces the rock and resumes her chant. \"This is an unexpected pleasure,\" Lord Loss says icily, drifting past Dervish and Bill-E towards us.\\n\\n \"When we heard about the party, we had to drop in,\" Beranabus quips, very different to his normal, serious self. \"I hope we\u0027re not unwelcome?\"\\n\\n \"Certainly not,\" Lord Loss smiles. \"I am delighted to see you. Especially young Grubitsch. I thought, when he slipped through our clutches on the aeroplane, that it might be a long time before our paths crossed again. Yet here he is, fresh and wide-eyed, ready to die. And you know you\u0027ll die, don\u0027t you, Grubitsch? You realise time has run out, that you, your uncle and brother are doomed?\"\\n\\n \"Shut up, you ba-\"\\n\\n I stop abruptly. He called Bill-E my brother. Of course Lord Loss knew about that-Bill-E was infected with the family curse-but Bill-E didn\u0027t. We never told him. I try looking past the demon master, to catch my half-brother\u0027s gaze, but Lord Loss is blocking the view.\\n\\n \"Yes, Grubitsch,\" the monster purrs. \"I told him. We spent quite an amount of time tonight discussing how you kept the truth from him and ran away when the going got tough, leaving him behind for me as an offering.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s not true!\" I shout. \"Don\u0027t believe him, Bill-E. I-\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s not important now,\" Beranabus interrupts. \"I want to know who\u0027s the mastermind behind this? What foul hellspawn are you working for? Who organised the demons and gave them orders to come running when the tunnel opens?\"\\n\\n Lord Loss frowns. \"You know about our plan?\"\\n\\n \"Obviously. Now tell me who\u0027s behind it.\"\\n\\n The demon master chuckles. \"No, Beranabus. You have been very clever. But if you do not know the full magnitude of the force you\u0027ve chosen to pit yourself against, I will not enlighten you. It\u0027s not my job to explain. Do your own detective work. I am sure you and your capable assistants can...\"\\n\\n He pauses, catching sight of the eyeless Kernel Fleck. \"But what is this? What happened to poor Cornelius?\"\\n\\n \"Never mind,\" Beranabus snaps. \"I want to know about-\"\\n\\n \"I recognise those wounds,\" Lord Loss continues, raising his voice. \"Those are the marks of my familiar, Spine. Such trademark injuries are unmistakable. I can even see some of his maggoty offspring embedded in the bloodied pits. It must have been a recent attack. But Spine has been with me the whole time.\" He looks back at his familiar. The scorpion with the semi-human face stares at him blankly.\\n\\n \"And your hair,\" Lord Loss says, facing us again. \"You\u0027re as hairless as myself. You\u0027ve been in a fight of great viciousness. Spine seems to have been in it too. But how...\"\\n\\n \"Tell us about the demon who set you up to this and I\u0027ll tell you about our fight,\" Beranabus grins.\\n\\n \"If I thought you were genuine, I\u0027d happily make that deal,\" Lord Loss replies. \"I sense great magic and mystery in this. If I did not know better, I would say...\" He trails off into silence, then sneers. \"But I know you, Beranabus. You are a rogue. You would renege on your promise and tell me nothing. So I\u0027ll hold my tongue and torture the truth out of the boys once I\u0027ve defeated you.\"\\n\\n \"Nay,\" Beranabus snorts. \"Secrecy and surprise were the only advantages you had. Now that we\u0027ve thwarted you, you must face us openly, on our world, where your powers are diminished. You can\u0027t beat us. If you abandon the spells and leave, I\u0027ll let you walk away and settle for sealing this place off. But if you force us to fight, we\u0027ll kill you all. Even those of you who have died before.\"\\n\\n \"Ah,\" Lord Loss chuckles. \"You\u0027ve seen through Miss Swan\u0027s disguise.\"\\n\\n \"I knew her for a cuckoo the moment I laid eyes on her,\" Beranabus says as Juni continues to chant, not glancing round even though she\u0027s the subject of their conversation. \"It took me a while to pierce the illusion, but I knew of her true face long before she moved against Grubbs.\"\\n\\n \"What are you talking about?\" I mutter.\\n\\n \"Watch,\" Beranabus says and murmurs the words of a quick spell, waving a hand at Juni. Lord Loss makes no move to defend her. He\u0027s loving this. As I stare at Juni, her flesh ripples. She stops chanting and cries out, but with surprise not pain. Her hands dart to her face and she turns sharply, flashing a furious glare at Beranabus. Dervish gives a muffled cry of shock and jerks away from her.\\n\\n Her face has changed completely. Much plainer. Bad acne scars. Dirty, short blonde hair. Blue eyes. A sullen expression. Quite fat. Pale skin, but not as white as her albino flesh. She appears younger than before, maybe mid- to late-twenties.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s happening?\" Kernel asks.\\n\\n Before I can tell him, Juni shrieks in a voice entirely unlike her own, \"Give me back my face, you swine!\"\\n\\n Kernel\u0027s forehead creases. \"Nadia?\" he gasps.\\n\\n \"You have a good ear,\" Lord Loss purrs. \"Shame about the eyes.\"\\n\\n \"Nadia Moore,\" Beranabus snorts. \"Another distant relative of yours, Grubbs, and once one of my closest assistants. I thought she died in Lord Loss\u0027s kingdom many years ago, but it seems she merely switched allegiances and created a new look for herself.\"\\n\\n \"Cornelius knew,\" Lord Loss says with relish. \"Not about her rebirth as Juni Swan, but about her survival, the trick she pulled to escape your tyrannical rule. He kept it a secret from you, Beranabus. Perhaps he has other secrets. Are you certain you can trust him?\"\\n\\n Beranabus sniffs away the jibe. \"I prefer you this way, Nadia,\" he says. \"Reality\u0027s more attractive than facade. You should have kept your original face.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not Nadia Moore,\" Juni snarls. \"She died, just the way you saw it. I put everything about her behind me-her name, features, loyalties. I\u0027m Juni Swan now and always will be, even if you\u0027ve disabled my glamour.\"\\n\\n \"I felt guilty when you were killed,\" Beranabus says softly. \"About as guilty as I\u0027ve ever felt in my long, wretched life. But I won\u0027t feel anything when you die a second time, when I kill you myself.\" His expression hardens and he addresses Lord Loss. \"My offer stands. Walk away now and we won\u0027t interfere-I\u0027ll even let Nadia leave too. If you stay, you die.\"\\n\\n \"A generous offer,\" Lord Loss says. \"If you had the backing of your Disciples, perhaps I\u0027d be inclined to accept and slaughter you another time-I prefer to fight when the odds are in my favour. But you come only with a blind boy and a cur who has already proven his cowardice. And though you yourself are a fearsome opponent, you\u0027re only one man. And no man, no matter how powerful, has ever got the better of a demon master. So, in answer to your offer...\"\\n\\n Lord Loss smirks vilely, then screeches unintelligibly at his familiars. With ear-piercing howls of delight, the demons attack. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/demon-apocalypse-the-demonata-6/page-13.html","bookId":2180,"book":{"id":2180,"title":"Demon Apocalypse (The Demonata #6)","description":"Storyline: Demon Apocalypse (The Demonata #6) \\n One boy\u0027s life ripped to shreds before his eyes...
