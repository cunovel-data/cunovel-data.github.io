{"id":99698,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"Sitting on my blanket, legs crossed, hunched over, fingers locked together. Beranabus is at his table, sorting through papers, muttering and whistling. Kernel is exercising, stretching and limbering up. They\u0027re setting off to fight demons shortly. They expect me to go with them. It\u0027s crazy. I told Beranabus I wouldn\u0027t do it. Leave my own world? Enter the Demonata\u0027s realm? Fight monsters like Lord Loss every day? No bloody way, Jo-bloody-se! Beranabus didn\u0027t argue. Just shrugged and said we all have to make our own decisions in life, then went to get ready. I sat by the fire a while longer, watching him and Kernel prepare. Then came back here, where I\u0027ve been sitting for the last half-hour, silent, numb. Kernel finishes stretching. Bends, touches his toes, then rises in the air. Slowly turns head over heels. Lands softly on his feet and lets go of his toes. Spots me watching him and walks over. \"Having fun?\" \"It\u0027s better than a circus.\" I stare up at him, his scars and bruises, the marks of past battles, the fear in his eyes. \"How do you do it?\" I whisper. \"I\u0027ve fought demons. I know what it\u0027s like. How do you find the courage to...\" Kernel shrugs like it\u0027s no big deal. Licks his lips and glances at Beranabus, then sits beside me. \"I never really had a choice,\" he says. \"I had a brother. Well, I thought... No, let\u0027s leave it at that-it gets too complicated otherwise. He was kidnapped by a demon. I followed after him. Met Beranabus and some others-your uncle was one of them.\" \"You know Dervish?\" I ask, surprised. \"Yes. I haven\u0027t seen him in thirty-odd years, but we were good friends back then. I wouldn\u0027t have survived without him. Is he still a punk?\" \"What?\" I frown. \"He was a punk. Spiked hair, earrings, leather jacket, chains.\" \"No,\" I chuckle. \"We must be talking about a different guy. Dervish was never...\" I hesitate. How many demon-fighting Disciples called Dervish can there be in the world? \"I\u0027ll quiz you about that later. Finish telling me about yourself first.\" Kernel shrugs. \"Things didn\u0027t work out with my brother. I returned home, but several years had passed-time works differently in the Demonata\u0027s universe. I couldn\u0027t pick up the pieces of my old life. I no longer belonged to that world. So I came to work for Beranabus. He taught me how to master my powers and slay demons. I\u0027ve been doing it ever since.\" \"What\u0027s it like? Do you have days off? Weekends? Holidays?\" Kernel laughs. \"Sure-two weeks on a beach of fire in the sunny south of Hades, half-price offseason. Of course we don\u0027t have holidays! We don\u0027t fight all the time-we have to rest, and Beranabus occasionally has to do something on this world-but we\u0027re at it most days of any given year.\" \"What do you do when you\u0027re not fighting?\" \"Recover and relax here.\" \"You don\u0027t get out at all? Not even for a day trip?\" \"Day trip to where?\" Kernel snorts. \"I pop up the ladder every now and then for a breath of fresh air. Maybe go for a walk for an hour or two. But it\u0027s boiling by day, freezing by night, and there\u0027s nothing to see or do.\" \"Doesn\u0027t Beranabus take you with him when he goes away?\" \"Rarely,\" Kernel says hotly. \"He prefers it if one of us is here when we\u0027re not battling demons, in case anyone tries to contact him. And even when he does take me, it\u0027s only ever on business. We\u0027re in and out as quickly as possible, keeping a low profile, hiding in the shadows.\" He stops. His fingers are trembling. There are hard tears in his eyes, but he\u0027s holding them back. I try thinking of something comforting to say, but can\u0027t. I want to change the subject, but don\u0027t know what to talk to him about. So I ask about his age-not entirely off-topic, but hopefully less of a sore point. \"You said you\u0027d been with Beranabus thirty years, but that can\u0027t be right. You don\u0027t look more than sixteen or seventeen.\" He smiles tiredly. \"Like I said, time works differently in the demon universe. It varies from zone to zone. In some places it passes faster than here or at the same rate, but usually it\u0027s slower. We\u0027re often gone for what feels like a day or two, only to return to find six months have passed here.\" \"Bloody hell!\" I gasp. Kernel nods miserably. \"In real time I\u0027ve been with Beranabus for... I don\u0027t know... maybe four or five years. But thirty or more have slipped by on Earth while we\u0027ve been off fighting demons.\" \"That\u0027s what Beranabus wants me to sign up for?\" I gulp. \"Spend my life facing demons? Live in a cave when I\u0027m not working? And go out one day to find that decades have passed and everyone I knew is old or dead?\" \"It sounds bad when you put it that way.\" Kernel laughs hollowly. \"It has its rewards. I\u0027m more powerful than just about any living human. And I save the planet from unimaginable dangers on a regular basis. But that\u0027s not much comfort when I\u0027m rotting away here or being pummelled by a four-headed giant.\" Kernel stands and smirks, a hint of pity in his otherwise bitter, mocking smile. \"Welcome to the firm.\" Then he goes to get ready. Beranabus works on opening a window to the Demonata\u0027s universe. It was a big deal for Dervish when he summoned Lord Loss, but Beranabus is more adept. A few spells, some scrawled symbols on the walls, a silly short dance and the world starts to fade around us. Smoke pours from Beranabus\u0027s flesh, all sorts of shapes, mostly a mix of animals and demons. The roof of the cave goes momentarily translucent. I spot a red sky full of giant demons streaking across the heavens like meteors. Then the cave firms up again. The smoke clears. And Beranabus is standing in front of a black pillar which is strangely familiar. The word \"monolith\" pops into my head, but I don\u0027t know why. \"Not bad, aye?\" Beranabus says. \"Kernel is the master of opening windows, but he\u0027s at his best in the universe of the Demonata. From here it\u0027s as easy for me to do it. But once we cross he\u0027s in a league of his own. You\u0027ll see what I mean soon enough-if you come with us.\" He takes a step back from the monolith. \"Made up your mind yet?\" \"I made it up ages ago,\" I snap. \"I\u0027m not coming.\" \"Of course you are,\" Beranabus smiles. \"Who could resist a challenge like this? The chance to flex your magical muscles, eliminate scores of demons, save the world. You\u0027ll come with us in the end, so why not drop the reluctant act and-\" \"I\u0027m not acting!\" I shout, flushing angrily. \"I\u0027ve had enough of demons. I don\u0027t want to fight them. I don\u0027t care how magical I am. I\u0027m not your assistant and I never will be. So just-\" \"There are two fields of thought about the granting of magical talent,\" Beranabus interrupts smoothly. \"Some claim it\u0027s pure luck, the random lottery of the universe doling out magic without method or purpose. Others-and I\u0027m one of them-believe there\u0027s a force which wants humans to triumph. We think magicians are created to keep the world safe from the Demonata, that at times of great peril, heroes are generated, capable of defeating the otherwise unstoppable forces of evil. \"It doesn\u0027t matter which is right. You have the power. Whether you gained it by design or accident is irrelevant. You have the ability to kill demons, to stop them crossing. If you don\u0027t make the most of that talent-if you hide from your duty-it\u0027s because you\u0027re a coward, plain and simple.\" I tremble with rage at the insult. Part of me wants to call upon all of my newly revealed powers and hit him with the strongest magical blast I can muster, to teach him never to mess with me again. But I don\u0027t. Because he\u0027s speaking the truth. Dervish loved me, so he never said it, but he must have thought it. He didn\u0027t object when I refused to learn spells and magic. He respected my choice and never made me feel like I was chickening out. I told myself I\u0027d done my bit and now I was entitled to a normal life. But that was rot. Deep down I knew I didn\u0027t want to fight because I was scared. Dervish knew it, I knew it and now Beranabus knows it. The only difference is, Beranabus has called me out. Beranabus is leaning towards me, eyebrows raised, awaiting my comeback. When I don\u0027t respond to the insult, he smiles sadly. \"I can\u0027t afford to wet-nurse you. This is a serious business, no room for lies or charades. When you were an average child, you could afford to be a coward-nobody suffered. Now you have to be a hero or untold billions might die.\" \"That\u0027s an exaggeration, isn\u0027t it?\" I mutter. \"No. Those are the stakes we play for. If it was hundreds, it wouldn\u0027t matter-I let that many die on the plane. Even millions... the world can afford to lose a few million humans every now and again. You could think of it as judicious pruning. Mankind would continue whether you joined us or not. \"But we deal in billions-wholesale slaughter. If the more powerful Demonata make it through, everybody perishes. That\u0027s why you can\u0027t be a coward any longer. I won\u0027t let you deny your calling just because you\u0027re a nice boy and I feel sorry for you. We have a duty-me, Kernel, you. Fair or not, that\u0027s the way it is. So you\u0027re coming through that window with us. Unless the coward within you is stronger than I think...\" He looks at me harshly. Behind him, Kernel keeps his head down. I think he\u0027s ashamed of Beranabus, but also of himself and the choices the pair of them must make. The choice I must make. \"I can\u0027t do it,\" I sob. \"You don\u0027t understand. I\u0027ve replayed those battles with Lord Loss so many times... Vein and Artery... Slawter... the anguish. I did it the first time to save Bill-E, because he\u0027s my brother, and in Slawter because we were trapped and it was fight or die. But there was never time to worry about it in advance or make a considered decision to pit myself against demons. This is different. I\u0027d be choosing horror and misery. I\u0027ve seen the nightmarish work of the Demonata in real life and in dreams. I can\u0027t face them again. I can\u0027t.\" \"You can,\" Beranabus says, not giving way. \"Unless you want to accept that you\u0027re a worthless coward. Unless you\u0027re prepared to flee like a whipped, shamed cur. Are you, Grubitsch?\" \"I...\" My voice seizes. I come within a breath of saying yes. I want to. I almost grasp the yellow mantle gratefully. But the shame... the guilt... to live the rest of my life as a branded coward... \"Please,\" I moan. \"Don\u0027t do this to me.\" \"It\u0027s already done,\" Beranabus says. \"I\u0027m not pushing you into anything. I\u0027m just the one who has the unpleasant task of breaking the news to you.\" He steps forward, grabs my shoulder and looks hard into my eyes. \"Hero or coward. There\u0027s no in-between. Choose now. The Demonata won\u0027t wait forever.\" Wanting to scream, to run, to tell him to go stuff himself. Knowing I can\u0027t, that I\u0027m gifted, that I\u0027m damned. \"I hope they kill me,\" I cry, tearing away from him, trembling wildly. \"I hope I don\u0027t last five minutes.\" \"I hoped that too when I first crossed,\" Kernel says softly, then walks to the monolith, puts a hand on the surface, breathes on it and steps through as the dark face shimmers. He vanishes. \"You will fare better than you fear, Grubitsch,\" Beranabus says encouragingly, following Kernel to the monolith. He puts a hand on it. \"Wait,\" I stop him and he looks back questioningly. \"If we\u0027re going to do this, I want to make one thing clear. It\u0027s Grubbs, understand? I bloody hate Grubitsch.\" Beranabus smiles crookedly and says with all the charm of Sweeney Todd, \"If you can kill demons, I\u0027ll call you anything you please. If not, I\u0027ll leave your bones lying scattered in their universe, nameless.\" He faces the monolith again and exhales. It shimmers and he moves forward. Gone. I don\u0027t think about this being my chance to run, to get out of here, lose myself in the desert and die on my own world. Afraid the coward within me will take control if I give it a chance. Without hesitation, I lurch forward, put both hands on the monolith, breathe on it like the others did and step through into madness.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/demon-apocalypse-the-demonata-6/page-5.html","bookId":2180,"book":{"id":2180,"title":"Demon Apocalypse (The Demonata #6)","description":"Storyline: Demon Apocalypse (The Demonata #6) One boy\u0027s life ripped to shreds before his eyes...
