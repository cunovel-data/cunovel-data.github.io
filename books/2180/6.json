{"id":99699,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"First impression-this place is infinitely different to the webby world of Lord Loss. Light blue in colour, it\u0027s like something out of a Picasso painting, all cubes and weird angles. We\u0027re in a valley of sorts. Narrow, jagged pillars of a weird blue substance rise high around us. I edge over to the nearest pillar and sniff, expecting the stench of sulphur. But it smells more like a piece of rotten fruit-a peach or pear maybe. \"Don\u0027t touch it,\" Beranabus says. \"It\u0027s probably not dangerous, but we don\u0027t take chances here. The less physical contact we make, the better.\" \"Where is this?\" I ask. \"The Demonata\u0027s universe, idiot,\" Kernel snaps. \"I meant which part? I don\u0027t know anything about the set-up here. Are there ten worlds, twenty, a thousand? \"Do they have names? Which one are we on?\" \"Geography doesn\u0027t work like that here,\" Beranabus says, studying the pillars, eyes sharp. \"The worlds and zones are constantly changing. There are many self-contained galaxies within the general demon universe. The stronger Demonata have the power to create their own realms or take over another demon\u0027s and reshape it. We never know what we\u0027re going to find when we cross.\" \"Then how do you hunt?\" I frown. \"We target specific demons. Realms might change, but demons don\u0027t, except for the shape-shifters, and even they don\u0027t change on the inside, where it counts. If we know a demon\u0027s name, Kernel can locate it within minutes. If we don\u0027t know, or if the demon doesn\u0027t have a name, it\u0027s more complicated. Each demon has a unique spiritual vibration.\" \"Call it a demonic frequency,\" Kernel chips in when I look blank. \"Demons have souls, like humans, and they emit a certain type of wave which we can sense. Each demon\u0027s soul is like a radio station, transmitting on an individual frequency. If we think a certain demon\u0027s working on a window or tunnel, we can lock on to its signal and track it down.\" \"It\u0027s not easy,\" Beranabus says, \"especially if it\u0027s a demon we\u0027ve had no first-hand experience of, but we usually find what we\u0027re looking for.\" Kernel points to one of the shorter pillars. \"There.\" Beranabus squints. \"Are you sure?\" \"Positive.\" \"Either you\u0027re getting sharper or my eyes are getting worse,\" Beranabus mutters, then raises a hand and sends a ball of energy shooting at the pillar. There\u0027s a gentle glowing. A sound somewhere between a sigh and a moan. Then the pillar moves and an angular demon steps out of a crack. Fear grabs hold and magic flares within me. I bring up my hands defensively, but Beranabus stops me with a high-spirited, \"Rein in those horses, boy!\" He faces the demon and smiles. \"How do you feel about dying today?\" The demon makes a series of choking noises. The sounds don\u0027t make sense to me, but Beranabus can decipher them. \"No,\" he says. \"We\u0027re not going to leave you alone. You know who we are and what we want. Now, do you have something to tell us or do we make life wickedly uncomfortable for you?\" The demon glares at Beranabus through a series of triangular eyes, but it looks more miserable than angry. It\u0027s an odd creature, not really frightening in manner or appearance. It mutters something. Beranabus and Kernel share a glance. \"You\u0027re sure?\" Kernel asks and the demon nods stiffly. \"Excellent,\" Beranabus beams and cocks his head at Kernel. The bald teenager shuffles away a couple of metres, then starts moving his hands about in the air. It\u0027s as if he\u0027s sliding invisible blocks around. \"What\u0027s happening?\" I ask Beranabus quietly, not wanting to disturb Kernel. \"I\u0027m opening a window,\" Kernel answers before Beranabus can, an edge to his voice. \"This is my speciality. I can see panels of light which are invisible to all others. When I slide certain panels together, windows form. I can get to anywhere in this universe-or ours-through them.\" \"Where will this one lead?\" I ask. \"You\u0027ll find out soon,\" Kernel says. \"We\u0027re going in search of prey. You want to kill demons, don\u0027t you?\" \"No. But let\u0027s say I did. What about that one?\" I point to the blue demon, which is edging back into the crack, becoming one with the landscape again. \"Not worth killing,\" Beranabus says dismissively. \"There are untold billions of demons. They\u0027re all evil, but most can\u0027t hurt us or cross to our world. That cretin doesn\u0027t even dare leave this valley. It waits, hiding and surviving, doing precious little else.\" \"What does it feed on?\" I ask. \"Who knows,\" Beranabus sniffs. \"Maybe nothing. Most demons don\u0027t need to eat and drink. Many do, but out of choice, not necessity.\" \"Then why did we come here, if not to kill it?\" I frown. \"Information,\" Kernel says, looking around. \"We\u0027re like detectives with a team of snitches. We know where to find soft demons. We often come to places like this, rough up the locals, find out if anything foul is afoot-something usually is. Demons like that one might not do much, but they know things. Secrets are hard to keep in this universe. Word spreads quickly.\" \"What\u0027s the word now?\" I ask, caught off guard. I don\u0027t know what I expected, but it wasn\u0027t something like this. \"There\u0027s a demon trying to possess a woman on Earth,\" Beranabus says. \"That happens all the time. It\u0027s not a problem for us, though it\u0027s bad for those involved. Some demons who can\u0027t cross universes can establish a hold on the minds of humans. They manipulate them, send them mad, use them to create as much chaos as possible. We normally wouldn\u0027t bother with small-scale melodramatics like this, but I want to break you in gently.\" Kernel grunts. \"On my first mission we fought a pair of demons who had almost broken through to the centre of Moscow. They were two of the toughest I\u0027ve ever faced. It was bloody and tight. That\u0027s when I lost the tips of my fingers.\" He stares at his left hand, the fingers flinching inwards as he relives the memory. \"Why couldn\u0027t you replace them?\" I ask. \"You can do that with magic, right?\" \"Normally. But the loss made little difference. I decided to leave them as they were. They remind me of the dangers we face, the fact that success isn\u0027t a guarantee, that we can and will perish in this hell-hole eventually.\" \"Here we go,\" Beranabus says briskly. A purplish window has formed in front of Kernel. Beranabus walks up to it and steps through, not bothering to breathe on this one. Kernel curls his fingers into a fist, then relaxes his fingers and follows. I look back in the direction of the blue demon, but I can\u0027t see it now, even though I know the exact spot where it\u0027s hiding. Shaking my head, I think, \"This isn\u0027t so bad. I can handle this.\" But I know it\u0027s a false start, that worse-much worse-is to come. There\u0027s a sound far overhead, from the meteor-sized demons in the sky. Fearful of being attacked while I\u0027m alone, I rush to the window and push through after the others. Fire! It\u0027s all around me, fierce, intense, out of control. I feel the hair on my arms singe and know I have only seconds before I burst into flames. Total panic. I want to look for Beranabus and Kernel or scream for help, but my eyes and mouth shut automatically against the heat. \"Oh, for the love of...\" Kernel tuts, taking hold of my arm and shaking it roughly. \"This is ridiculous. He\u0027s not fit for this. Send him back.\" \"He\u0027ll learn,\" Beranabus says and then his lips are by my left ear. \"Use magic to guide yourself.\" \"It\u0027s hell!\" I moan, speaking out of the side of my mouth, keeping my eyes shut. \"One of many thousands of hells,\" Beranabus grunts. \"For every imaginative demon who constructs a terrifyingly original realm, there are scores who draw upon tired old human myths. Stop acting like a fool. You can already feel your magic responding to this, protecting you from the flames. You\u0027d be burning to a crisp right now if not.\" I open one eye, then the other. Nothing to see but flames. Beranabus and Kernel are hard to spot among the flickering licks of yellow and red. Still hot, hotter than I should be able to bear. But magic\u0027s humming away in the background, cooling me down, guarding my freckled flesh. Beranabus is right-it kicked in as soon as I set foot here, even as the hairs on my arms began to shrivel. I knew that-I could feel it-but fear made me panic. \"Where\u0027s the demon?\" I ask, trying to peer through the walls of fire. I look down and realise we\u0027re truly in the middle of the flames-no floor. Nothing below, above or to the sides except fire. \"The flames are the demon,\" Kernel says. \"It\u0027s a universal demon.\" \"Am I supposed to know what that means?\" I growl. \"Universal demons don\u0027t just inhabit a galaxy of their own-they become it,\" Beranabus explains. \"This demon has a fascination with fire, so it became flames. Its whole zone-the demon itself-is made of fire.\" \"But where does it start?\" I ask. \"Where does it end?\" \"Nowhere,\" Beranabus says. \"This demon is its own self-contained and at the same time limitless realm. It\u0027s like our universe-infinite.\" While I\u0027m trying to make sense of that-I\u0027ve always had problems thinking of a universe being infinite, never mind one single creature-the flames thicken around us. There\u0027s a horrible shrieking sound, piercing and destructive. My eardrums and eyeballs should burst, but magic protects me instinctively. (Which is just as well, since I wouldn\u0027t know where to start to control it!) A shape forms amid the flames, gigantic and bulging, like the wizard\u0027s fake head in The Wizard of Oz, only a hundred times bigger and more frightening, full of leaping shadows, sparks and flames. The demon shrieks again. A huge, rough, fiery fist forms and smashes down on Beranabus. He waves an arm at the fist and slices through the flames. The edges of his beard singe, but he\u0027s otherwise unharmed. Another fist forms and tries to swat Kernel aside. He leaps high, somersaults over it, opens his mouth mid-leap and sucks in sharply. He inhales flames, face turning a pure, angry, painful white. The demon screams. Kernel lands, coughs, spins and leaps over another quickly formed fist. Beranabus grabs handfuls of flames and rams them into his stomach. And I mean into-his hands pierce his own flesh. He\u0027s stuffing his guts full of fire. The hands come out, the wall of his stomach unharmed. He grabs more flames and jams them in. Out-in. Out-in. And what does the heroic Grubbs Grady do? I hang beside them, helpless and shivering, about as much use as a plastic toasting fork. I want to help, but I don\u0027t know how. My magic isn\u0027t strong enough. I don\u0027t want to be here. This isn\u0027t my fight. Then, in the middle of the battle, the demon focuses on me. Two huge fists form on either side and slam towards me, to hammer me lifeless. I throw myself to the floor. Except there isn\u0027t a floor. Just flames. I don\u0027t know how I\u0027ve been hovering, but I\u0027m not anymore. I\u0027m falling, like when Beranabus ripped me out of the plane, dropping like a sack of stones, quickly losing sight of the magician and his assistant. \"Help!\" I scream. \"Help yourself,\" Beranabus roars, then curses brutally. I come to a stop. Relief evaporates moments later when I realise I haven\u0027t been helped by Beranabus or Kernel-I\u0027m being held in the middle of a giant hand of fire. The fingers close upon me. The heat\u0027s unbearable. I feel my magic struggling, protesting, pleading with me to direct it, use it, fight back. But what can I do? How can I defeat a creature made of flames? It\u0027s impossible. At least Lord Loss and his familiars were real targets. I could hit them. This is lunacy. We\u0027re all going to perish, burnt to death by a demon the size of a universe. I scream at the flames. The fingers stop, shudder, then tear apart. I fall again. I\u0027m crying, taking no satisfaction out of destroying the hand because I\u0027m sure another will form any second now, bigger, stronger, hotter. Then Kernel is by my side. His eyes are sharp bright blue with rage. \"Bloody amateur,\" he sneers. \"Bloody coward.\" \"I can\u0027t do it,\" I babble. \"I told you I couldn\u0027t. I didn\u0027t want to come here. Make me stop falling. Help me get-\" \"Shut up, you worm!\" Kernel shouts. \"I should let you burn.\" He laughs cruelly. \"The hell with it. Your death would serve no purpose.\" He darts away from me, angling down, moving much quicker than I\u0027m falling. He becomes a speck, then stops. As I hurtle towards him, I see his hands moving, the way they did when he created the window to this universe. When I\u0027m maybe a hundred metres away, a dark green window forms. Kernel slides away from it and waves at me like a policeman directing traffic. I\u0027m rushing towards the window. The flames peel away from me. The window gets bigger and bigger as I fall upon it. I just have time to worry about what will happen when I flash through and smash into the ground on the other side. Then I hit it and everything goes green.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/demon-apocalypse-the-demonata-6/page-6.html","bookId":2180,"book":{"id":2180,"title":"Demon Apocalypse (The Demonata #6)","description":"Storyline: Demon Apocalypse (The Demonata #6) One boy\u0027s life ripped to shreds before his eyes...
