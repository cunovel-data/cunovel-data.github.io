{"id":101109,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"My first impulse, when I stop crying, is to rush back to Carcery Vale and warn Dervish and Bill-E of the danger they\u0027re in.\n \"We already had this conversation,\" Beranabus sighs.\n \"I don\u0027t care,\" I snap. \"Juni didn\u0027t just target me-she went after Bill-E too. She might not return to the Vale straightaway, but she can easily phone Dervish and ask about me. If she discovers he doesn\u0027t know where I am or what really happened, she can return and...\" I shake my head viciously, trying not to think of all the terrible things she could do. \"We have to go back and warn them.\"\n \"No,\" Beranabus says softly. \"Their welfare isn\u0027t my concern.\"\n \"How can you say that?\" I shriek. \"Dervish is your friend.\"\n \"No-if anything, he\u0027s my employee.\"\n \"What do you...\" I stop, finally realising where I had heard Beranabus\u0027s name before. Dervish mentioned it when he was explaining about his work. I should have put two and two together when he was talking about the warning spells at the cave, but my head\u0027s still in a whirl. \"You\u0027re the boss of the Disciples,\" I mutter.\n \"I wouldn\u0027t describe myself that way,\" Beranabus sniffs. \"I don\u0027t have much to do with them. I use the Disciples where appropriate, but I fight most of my battles in the Demonata\u0027s universe, alone.\"\n \"Not quite alone,\" Kernel huffs.\n Beranabus grunts offhandedly at Kernel, then addresses me again. \"I didn\u0027t form the Disciples. They came to me looking for leadership and training. I occasionally demand their help, but I\u0027ve no vested interest in the group.\"\n \"But Dervish is one of your people,\" I argue. \"He told me you sent him to Carcery Vale to protect the cave. You\u0027re responsible for him.\"\n \"No!\" Beranabus barks. He brushes his long hair back from his face, glowering at me. \"I sent Dervish to Carcery Vale, as I sent others before him, to watch for demons and their human servants, to report to me if any came sniffing in search of the cave. Everything else in his life was secondary to that task. He should have respected my instructions, kept a low profile, not got entangled with a demon master like Lord Loss. He brought this trouble on himself. I don\u0027t have time to get involved in personal conflicts. Lord Loss has nothing to do with the cave, so I don\u0027t care what he does to Dervish.\"\n \"You\u0027re a monster,\" I sneer. \"You\u0027re no better than the Demonata.\"\n \"Perhaps not,\" Beranabus concedes. \"But the Disciples understand that there are forces at work in the universe far more important than anything in their own lives. They accept the need to put human concerns behind them and focus on the nobler cause to which they\u0027ve been called.\"\n \"I don\u0027t do noble causes,\" I retort. \"I care about Dervish and Bill-E. That\u0027s all. They\u0027re more important to me than anything else, even the safety of the bloody world.\"\n \"He\u0027s arrogant and stupid,\" Kernel says, staring at me coldly. \"He can\u0027t see the bigger picture. You made a mistake bringing him here. Send him back. Let him perish at the hands of Lord Loss.\"\n \"That isn\u0027t your decision to make,\" Beranabus says, eyes flashing. \"Don\u0027t forget your place. You\u0027re here to serve.\"\n \"Well, it\u0027s true,\" Kernel pouts.\n Beranabus takes a steadying breath, then faces me again. \"What I\u0027m trying to explain,\" he says, only barely restraining his anger, \"is that Dervish wouldn\u0027t want us to rush back. He understands the importance of my work and knows I don\u0027t get involved in minor skirmishes-which is all this is. He doesn\u0027t expect me to ride to his rescue. This quarrel with Lord Loss and Juni Swan is of his own making and he must deal with them himself.\n \"Having said that,\" Beranabus continues, raising his voice to stop me interrupting, \"I will get word to him, as I promised. I can\u0027t get in touch with him now-there are no easy means of making contact with the outside world from here-but as soon as I can, I\u0027ll warn him of Juni\u0027s treachery and the threat he faces. That\u0027s the best I can offer. And it\u0027s all Dervish would expect.\"\n \"Fine,\" I grunt, getting to my feet. \"But I\u0027m not one of your Disciples, so I don\u0027t have to obey your rules. I\u0027ll go and warn him right now if you\u0027ll just point me in the right direction...\" I look at him challengingly, expecting an argument.\n Beranabus smiles flatly. \"Once you leave the cave, the fastest route is east. It\u0027s a long, hard walk. The sun is merciless, waterholes are few and far between, and there\u0027s little food to be found. An experienced trekker or a magician might make it out alive. But you\u0027re not a worldly traveller and you don\u0027t know how to make the most of your magical potential. You\u0027ll be dead within a week. But if you want to make the attempt regardless, go ahead. I won\u0027t detain you.\"\n \"Right,\" I nod sharply. \"I will.\"\n I start towards the rope ladder, but Kernel stops me. \"Grubitsch... Grubbs. He\u0027s telling the truth. You can\u0027t make it. You\u0027ll die if you try.\"\n \"I\u0027d rather die trying than live and let Dervish and Bill-E be butchered.\"\n \"It would be pointless,\" Kernel argues. \"Even if you got out alive, it would take weeks to reach civilisation. Dervish will find out quicker through us. Disciples visit here regularly. One might come tomorrow or the next day. You won\u0027t achieve anything by sacrificing yourself. Do you want us to tell your uncle you wasted your life on a pointless mission? How do you think that would make him feel?\"\n I stare at Kernel coldly, then turn slowly to Beranabus. \"You swear you\u0027ll let him know as soon as you can?\"\n The magician nods. \"As Kernel said, we receive several visitors a year. When the next Disciple comes, I\u0027ll give him or her a message to pass on to Dervish.\"\n \"What if it\u0027s months before anyone visits?\"\n Beranabus doesn\u0027t reply.\n I think it over. Weigh up the pros and cons. Try to decide what Dervish would tell me to do. I finally figure it makes no sense to leave.\n \"OK,\" I sigh, taking my place by the fire. \"I don\u0027t like it, and I\u0027ll hold you to account if anything happens to Dervish or Bill-E. But I\u0027m going to trust you. I don\u0027t know for sure that I should, but to hell with it. Now I assume you brought me here for a purpose. What is it?\"\n Beranabus laughs. \"Damn it all, I like you! You\u0027re blunt and to the point. I\u0027m sure you\u0027ll cause me all sorts of aggravation, but I\u0027m looking forward to having you around.\"\n \"Never mind the compliments,\" I growl. \"Just tell me why I\u0027m here.\"\n \"Very well. As I explained, I don\u0027t have much to do with the Disciples. They deal with largely unimportant matters. They stop some demons from crossing and limit the damage caused by those who get through. That doesn\u0027t mean much in the universal scheme of things. Hundreds of casualties... a few thousand... even a few million... what of them?\"\n I gawp at the elderly tramp, then at Kernel. \"Is he for real?\"\n \"You\u0027d better believe it,\" Kernel says in a low voice, looking at Beranabus darkly.\n \"I can\u0027t waste time worrying about a few dead humans,\" Beranabus defends himself. \"I have more important work to tend to.\"\n \"What\u0027s more important than saving lives?\" I challenge him.\n \"Saving the world,\" he answers without the least hint of irony. \"Most of the demons who hit our universe are weak. It\u0027s relatively easy for a sly demon-with human assistance-to create a window between their universe and ours, but the masters can\u0027t squeeze through. Occasionally a tunnel can be opened-like at the cave in Carcery Vale-which more powerful demons can access. But most of the time only the lesser Demonata can cross and they can\u0027t stay more than a few minutes. A nuisance, aye, but they don\u0027t threaten the existence of the human race.\n \"I focus on combating the threat of the stronger monsters, those who could wipe out mankind. They\u0027re always looking for ways to cross. The Disciples act when they uncover evidence on this world of a potential crossing, but I can\u0027t allow that to happen with the masters. I have to prevent such threats in their infancy.\n \"To do that, Kernel and I work in the universe of the Demonata. Unlike the Disciples, we spend little time on this world. We walk among demons, spying on them, uncovering their plans in the formative stages, wrecking them. We divide demons who are working together. Locate and destroy places where tunnels could be built. It\u0027s difficult. We have to fight constantly and the battles are savage.\"\n \"Savage,\" Kernel echoes, his voice a whisper.\n \"It\u0027s a horrible undertaking,\" Beranabus says. \"One might even call it a curse. But it has to be done. The Demonata are a constant threat. Those of us with the power to limit them to their own realm don\u0027t have the freedom of choice. Kernel and I know that if we don\u0027t fight the monsters on their worlds, the demon masters will cross and fight us on ours-and everyone will perish.\n \"We went to Carcery Vale as soon as I heard the entrance to the cave had been opened. My warning spells should have been activated instantly, but for whatever reason they didn\u0027t work. When Dervish sent word, we rushed to the scene. I feared the handiwork of the Demonata and thought I might be too late to stop them. To my relief I found no evidence of their presence.\"\n \"What about Lord Loss?\" I cry \"And Juni?\"\n \"They didn\u0027t bother me. Lord Loss doesn\u0027t want to open a tunnel. He prefers things the way they are. I considered talking with Dervish about Juni, but I didn\u0027t know if I could trust him. For all I knew, he\u0027d pledged himself to her dark cause and was working with her to trap me.\"\n \"Dervish would never do that,\" I growl.\n \"Probably not,\" Beranabus agrees. \"But he might have fallen under her spell. She could have been using him to strike at me. I decided not to reveal my presence. I sent Kernel back here and remained hidden, to ensure no demons came to make use of the cave. I planned to close the entrance again and let Dervish know about Juni before I left. But then I spotted you...\"\n The hairs on the back of my neck stand up. I\u0027m no fool. I can see where this is heading. But I say nothing. I act ignorant, hoping I\u0027m wrong, not wanting to put ideas in his head if they aren\u0027t already there-though I\u0027m certain they are.\n \"You\u0027d hidden your magic masterfully,\" Beranabus says, \"but it had started to spill out by the time I arrived. I could see it shining through.\"\n \"Dervish and Juni didn\u0027t,\" I mumble. \"Juni tested me, searching for magic. She couldn\u0027t find any.\"\n \"Of course she could,\" he barks. \"You still haven\u0027t seen through all of her deceptions. I don\u0027t blame you. It\u0027s hard, when you\u0027ve trusted someone, to see them as they really are. You know Juni was working against you all this time, but you still think of her as a friend.\n \"Juni\u0027s far more powerful than Dervish. She knew the magic was there. Those tests were to check how strong you were, how much of a threat you posed, so she and Lord Loss could plan their assault. I don\u0027t think she was able to find out as much about you as she hoped. That\u0027s why they decided to confront you in the cave. They chose a place of magic, where Lord Loss would be more powerful. When you escaped, they switched to the aeroplane, figuring that up in the air you couldn\u0027t escape-at worst, they could crash the aircraft and kill you that way.\n \"Juni\u0027s been manipulating you at every step. Worming out your secrets, finding weaknesses to use against you. She\u0027s a cunning vixen. She artfully drove a wedge between you and Dervish. Even summoned the Lambs to make you believe he\u0027d sacrificed you to the Grady executioners.\"\n \"You mean he didn\u0027t?\" I gawp at Beranabus, ashen-faced.\n \"Of course not,\" Beranabus grunts. \"You know your uncle. You saw how he fought to save your brother. He would have done the same for you. He\u0027s not a man to give up on his loved ones.\"\n I feel cold inside. I thought Dervish had betrayed me, when in fact I did the betraying. I should have known he wouldn\u0027t call in the Lambs without discussing it first. Dervish always played straight with me, ever since he came to visit me in the asylum and told me that he knew demons were real.\n \"I\u0027ve been a fool,\" I mutter.\n \"Aye,\" Beranabus says. \"But we all make fools of ourselves one time or another. It\u0027s part of being human. But that\u0027s beside the point. I was talking about...\" He frowns and looks to Kernel for help.\n \"You\u0027d just spotted the shining beacon of magic that was Grubbs Grady,\" Kernel says drily, and I realise he\u0027s jealous of me.\n \"Of course. Forgive me, I lose track of my thoughts so easily. Old age and more battles with the Demonata than I care to remember. Yes, I was on the verge of leaving Carcery Vale, satisfied that no demons were lurking in the wings, when you caught my eye. I saw your magic, the struggle taking place within you, the power you could wield if you survived. It\u0027s not often that I come across such a promising find.\n \"I stayed to track your development. I staked you out and let you see me from time to time-I hoped your magic would respond to mine. I was trying to load the deck in my favour. I\u0027d apologise, but that would be hypocritical of me.\"\n \"Get on with it,\" I snarl.\n \"There\u0027s not much more to get on with. I spied on Dervish and Juni when I wasn\u0027t following you. I knew that witch was up to no good, but I wasn\u0027t sure of her exact plans. Then I saw the Lambs arrive. You burst out of the underground cellar. I trailed you to the cave, but didn\u0027t follow you down-Juni would have sensed my presence. I waited while she came, dealt with you and left again. Then you burst out of the cave. I pursued you to your brother\u0027s house, then the airport. When I realised Juni planned to board an aeroplane with you, I guessed what her plan was and I followed.\"\n \"You could have stopped her,\" I say icily. \"You knew she was going to kill the other passengers. You could have attacked. Ripped me from her before we got on.\"\n \"No,\" he says. \"I wasn\u0027t sure. She might not have struck on the aeroplane. Or perhaps she was taking you somewhere else to meet Lord Loss. Maybe you were in league with her. I weighed up all my options and I decided to wait. It was the right call and if I had to make it again, I\u0027d do exactly the same thing.\"\n He scowls at the disgusted look I give him, then waves the matter away. \"And here we are,\" he says. \"The end of the story.\"\n \"Not quite,\" I reply. \"You still haven\u0027t said what you want me for, why you rescued me and brought me here.\"\n Beranabus frowns. \"Isn\u0027t that obvious?\"\n \"Yes. But I want you to say it.\"\n \"Very well. You\u0027re a magician. I want you to become my assistant, like Kernel, cross into the universe of the Demonata with us, and spend the rest of your life by my side, killing demons.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/demon-apocalypse-the-demonata-6/page-4.html","bookId":2180,"book":{"id":2180,"title":"Demon Apocalypse (The Demonata #6)","description":"Storyline: \n Demon Apocalypse (The Demonata #6) \n One boy\u0027s life ripped to shreds before his eyes...
