{"id":99710,"no":17,"title":"Page 17","content":"Dervish\u0027s bedroom. He\u0027s sitting on the end of his bed, expression blank. He hasn\u0027t washed the dirt and blood from his face and hands yet. I haven\u0027t either. Too weary for such mundane tasks. Life will go on, I\u0027m sure-it always does. But right now we\u0027re a pair of zombies, capable only of the simplest movements. \"See you later,\" I mumble, turning to go to my own room. \"Wait,\" Dervish says. \"I don\u0027t want to be alone, not now. Stay. Please?\" With a weary nod, I start to pull at the leaves of my magical suit. It\u0027s hanging off me in shreds and will be simple to remove. But after picking at a few leaves, I lose interest and crawl onto the bed beside Dervish. I put my arms around him and we hold each other tight. He often held me like this when I first came to live with him, whenever I awoke from a particularly brutal nightmare. But this time the nightmare is reality and there\u0027s little comfort to be found in the embrace. \"You had to do it,\" Dervish whispers. I break into fresh tears. \"He was my brother,\" I moan. \"What would Dad have said?\" \"The same thing I\u0027m saying,\" Dervish croaks. \"You did what had to be done. It should have been me. I was his guardian-yours too. The responsibility was mine. But I couldn\u0027t find the strength. I failed. If you hadn\u0027t been so brave, we\u0027d have all died and Billy would have suffered terribly. You did what was best. You should feel proud, not wretched.\" I laugh bitterly. \"Proud! Yeah, sure.\" Dervish sighs. \"Wrong word. You should feel... I don\u0027t know... maybe there isn\u0027t a word for it. But you did the right thing. That has to be enough. It has to keep you going. Because if you let this destroy you-if you let the madness take you-I\u0027ll lose two nephews, not one.\" \"But it\u0027s so tempting,\" I mumble. \"I want out, Dervish. I know what it\u0027s like to be mad. It\u0027s easier than this. Anything\u0027s easier than this.\" Dervish is silent a minute. Then he says, \"I\u0027ll make you a deal. If you fight the temptation... stay sane, no matter how painful it is... so will I.\" \"You feel it too?\" I ask, surprised by his admission. He nods. By the way he trembles, I know he\u0027s not just saying it. \"Like you said, anything would be easier than this. But we have each other. If you fight, so will I. I\u0027ll stay sane for you if you stay sane for me. Agreed?\" I hug him tighter, loving him more than I ever did before. \"Agreed.\" Dervish blinks at the ceiling. \"It sounds crazy, but I\u0027m sad about Juni too. I know she was evil and I hate her for what she did, but I loved her. I really thought we were going to be together for the rest of our lives. She had to die, and I\u0027m glad I killed her, but...\" \"I know what you mean. I miss her too. I was surprised Lord Loss took her body. I guess he plans to bury or cremate her.\" Dervish snorts. \"Eat her, more probably!\" We laugh softly, painfully-the first step back towards something that might one day pass for a normal life. And then, holding one another, we close our eyes, listen to the sounds of the mansion and the world outside, and slowly drift off into a nightmare-laced but nonetheless welcome sleep. It\u0027s dark when I wake. Dervish is snoring lightly. I lie still for a few minutes, enjoying the nearness of my uncle, remembering Bill-E and Loch, my lost brother and friend, trying not to cry, just about managing to hold back the tears. I ease myself off the bed, careful not to disturb Dervish. My suit of leaves has disintegrated entirely. I brush the last of the flaky patches off, then pad to my bedroom, shower and kit myself out in more regular clothes. Thinking about all that\u0027s happened while I dress, the night when I almost became a werewolf, the plane, Beranabus, fighting the demons, travelling back through time, killing Bill-E. Is it just me or does all that seem a bit much for a teenager to have to deal with? Most of my friends have nothing more catastrophic than acne or bad breath to overcome. Wouldn\u0027t it have been fairer to spread the craziness around? Couldn\u0027t Charlie have been stuck with the werewolf curse, and Frank with being a magician? Couldn\u0027t Leon have been betrayed by Juni, and Robbie recruited by Beranabus? And let\u0027s not leave the girls out. Reni did her bit, losing Loch, but Mary could easily have had to kill one of her brothers, and Shannon could have done the whole trip through time stuff. I chuckle (nice to see I still can). I\u0027m being ridiculous, but there\u0027s a nugget of truth there. It\u0027s been a heavy burden for a single person to bear, especially one as young, inexperienced and... hell, let\u0027s say it... cowardly as me. It isn\u0027t fair. But the universe isn\u0027t fair. Things don\u0027t work out neatly, pain, hardship and challenges divided equally among those best equipped to deal with them. Sometimes individuals have to be Atlases and carry the weight of the world alone. It shouldn\u0027t happen that way, but it does. At least I have the crumb of comfort of not having fallen. I stumbled and wished all the time that I could bail out. But I kept going. I did what I had to. I came through. It would have been sweet to do it unscathed, Bill-E and Loch alive and well. But in the grand scheme of things, I don\u0027t have too much to complain about. That\u0027s how Beranabus would see it. And he\u0027s right. But that doesn\u0027t make me feel any better. The devastation of having killed Bill-E is all-consuming. I don\u0027t think any amount of reasoning will ever ease that pain. Dressed, I go looking for Beranabus, Kernel and Bec. Trying to focus on their needs, since it helps me not brood about Bill-E. Beranabus was badly wounded in the fight and might need help. Kernel will be in a lot of pain. He said he\u0027d have to go to a hospital. I can arrange that. And Bec... I\u0027m not sure what I can do for a girl who\u0027s been dead for sixteen hundred years, only to find herself slap-bang in the middle of the modern world. Guide her round the house for a start, I guess. Teach her how to open and close doors and windows, explain what TVs, computers and CD players are. No... they can come later. First teach her how to run a bath and use the shower. Give her some clothes to keep her ticking over until she can go shopping in the Vale. Explain where everything is in the kitchen, what a fridge is, how to open a tin, that water comes from a tap and not a well. I\u0027m padding down the stairs when I hear her. No... not hear, exactly. I sense her. In the hall of portraits. Changing direction, I go to check that she\u0027s OK. I find her studying the faces of dead Gradys and our various relations, slowly moving from one painting or photo to the next, eyes steady, head cocked slightly to one side. \"These are not drawings,\" she says without looking around, sensing my presence the same way I sensed hers. \"They\u0027re photographs.\" \"Are they magic? Are people alive within them, their souls trapped like mine was in the cave?\" \"No. It\u0027s just their image. We use machines to take them.\" \"Machines?\" \"Special tools.\" She turns. \"I\u0027ve seen nothing of this new world. I was limited to the cave. I could peer into the universe of the Demonata, but this world was a blank. I don\u0027t know what has changed and what hasn\u0027t.\" \"Most of it\u0027s different to what you knew. Probably everything. It\u0027ll take a while to get used to, but you\u0027ll be OK. Look at it like an adventure-you\u0027ll be exploring a brand new planet.\" \"Yes. I\u0027m excited. Scared but excited.\" She sighs and looks at the photos again. \"Your family?\" \"Some of them.\" I move up beside her. \"They all caught the disease, or died trying to help others who were infected. You know that some of us change into wolf-like beasts, don\u0027t you?\" \"I saw them in my own time,\" she answers. \"I didn\u0027t think the curse would last this long. But I\u0027m not surprised. The blood of the Demonata is strong.\" She looks at me shyly. \"We are family. Separated by many generations, but family nevertheless.\" \"I know.\" \"The evil priestess-Juni Swan, Nadia Moore, whatever you want to call her-was one like us. Bran told me she could see into the future. Perhaps our demonic heritage was the source of her strange power.\" I grunt. I don\u0027t want to talk about Juni right now. \"The boy... Bill-E... he was family too.\" \"Yes,\" I mutter. \"My brother.\" \"I\u0027m sorry...\" she starts to say. \"Don\u0027t worry about it,\" I interrupt. \"It wasn\u0027t your fault. Bill-E wouldn\u0027t mind. He was always keen on recycling.\" \"\u0027Recycling\u0027?\" Bec frowns. \"I\u0027ll explain later. Where are Beranabus and Kernel?\" \"Outside. They...\" She casts a look at me and I instantly know what they\u0027re doing, what they want of me. \"Already?\" I ask stiffly. \"They can\u0027t wait a while?\" \"No.\" She looks back at the faces. \"I\u0027m not going. Bran told me to stay. He said I would be company for Dervish, that he could look after me and I could look after him. He said we would be good for one another.\" \"I\u0027ll be looking after Dervish,\" I snap. Bec shrugs. \"I\u0027m only repeating what Bran said. He also said Dervish could teach me about the new world, while he could teach you more about magic. In his opinion that arrangement will work best for everyone.\" \"We\u0027ll see about that,\" I huff, storming off. I pause before turning the corner and glance back at her. \"If for some reason I don\u0027t return... if anything happens to me... you will take care of Dervish, won\u0027t you?\" \"I\u0027ve comforted people who lost loved ones before. There were many in my rath-my village. I will do my best. I promise.\" I nod thankfully, then hurry downstairs to sort out things with Beranabus and put him straight on a couple of issues. The magician and Kernel are in front of the house, squatting in the middle of the road, draped in clothes which they\u0027re taken from our wardrobes. They\u0027ve healed the worst of their wounds, though they\u0027re covered in cuts and bruises and Kernel\u0027s as blind as he was before. A familiar monolith hangs in the air between them. \"Leaving so soon?\" I ask Beranabus tightly. \"Work to be done,\" he says briskly. \"You\u0027ve seen Bec?\" \"Yes. She\u0027s under the impression that I\u0027m leaving. Said she\u0027d been charged with the task of looking after Dervish.\" \"Bec\u0027s staying?\" Kernel asks, surprised. \"I considered bringing her with us,\" Beranabus says. \"We can\u0027t test the Kah-Gash properly without her. I\u0027ve waited so long to find the different pieces. It might be madness to leave her behind. But the weapon unnerves me. It gave us the power to come back in time and stop the Demonata-but before that it led Grubbs to the cave and initiated this whole train of events.\" \"I don\u0027t recall it leading me,\" I frown. \"The night you went to the cave when you were turning into a werewolf,\" Beranabus reminds me. \"You cleared most of the entrance. Bec didn\u0027t summon you and Lord Loss wasn\u0027t involved at that stage. It can only have been the work of the Kah-Gash. It wanted you to reopen the cave- which makes me assume it also wanted to reopen the tunnel.\" \"You\u0027re saying we can\u0027t trust it?\" Kernel barks. \"After all this time and effort, the things we\u0027ve sacrificed, the risks we\u0027ve taken... it was all in pursuit of a weapon we don\u0027t dare use?\" \"We\u0027ll use it eventually,\" Beranabus says. \"We\u0027ll have to. But I want to study the pair of you first and try to form a better idea of what we\u0027ll be dealing with when we next unleash its power. I think it\u0027s better not to keep the three of you together until we\u0027re sure we can control the Kah-Gash.\" \"Then why not leave me behind and take Bec?\" I ask. Beranabus sighs. \"She\u0027s suffered greatly and I care about her deeply. I was scatterbrained as a child-I bet you find that hard to believe! Bec helped me make a vital breakthrough. She set me on track and rooted me in reality. I owe her more than I can ever repay. She deserves to live again, to be human. I\u0027d leave her here forever if I could. That\u0027s impossible, but since it makes sense to keep one of you out of the way of the others for a while, I\u0027ll gladly give her this free time. As the gods surely know, she\u0027s earned it.\" \"That\u0027s the most human thing I\u0027ve ever heard you say,\" Kernel murmurs. Then he frowns. \"If you knew her, that means you were alive sixteen hundred years ago. I didn\u0027t think humans could survive that long.\" \"They can\u0027t,\" Beranabus grunts. He wipes dried blood from his cheeks, but it\u0027s yellow, not red. \"You saw me changing in the cave, didn\u0027t you?\" he asks me. \"I saw... something,\" I answer cagily. \"It surfaces occasionally. Sometimes I need to draw on its powers. It\u0027s a dangerous game, involving it so intimately. I run the risk of succumbing to it and losing control. But there are times when we must gamble.\" He scowls, then says quickly, bluntly, \"I\u0027m half-Demonata. My father was a demon. That\u0027s where my magic comes from. It\u0027s how I\u0027ve lived so long.\" \"You never told me,\" Kernel whispers. \"It\u0027s not something I\u0027m proud of,\" Beranabus says acidly. \"My mother fell foul of the beast. She never meant for this to happen. It was a horrible twist of fate-or the universe\u0027s way of protecting itself from the Demonata.\" \"Could you have been one of them?\" Kernel asks. \"You\u0027ve passed for human all this time. Could you have lived as a demon if you\u0027d wished?\" \"Aye. The possibility of becoming a fully fledged demon was always there. It still is. My demon half constantly tempts me, urges me to give myself over to evil, join the Demonata and help them conquer this world. I fight it daily. I\u0027ve held it in check-so far.\" \"Which one of them is your father?\" I ask. \"Lord Loss?\" \"Don\u0027t be ridiculous,\" he snorts. \"My father was a lesser demon. I tracked him down many centuries ago. I killed the beast and relieved him of his head. Used the skull as a bedpan for a time.\" He jerks his thumb at the monolith. \"Now that we\u0027ve had the sordid family history, can we move on?\" \"I\u0027m not going,\" I tell him. \"I\u0027m staying here with Dervish and Bec.\" Beranabus shrugs. \"If that\u0027s what you want.\" \"Don\u0027t say it like that. I\u0027ve done my bit. I stopped the demons breaking through. I killed my brother and saved the world. What more do you want from me?\" I scream. Beranabus doesn\u0027t blink. \"It\u0027s not what I want-it\u0027s what the universe wants. And what I\u0027ve learnt from my long years is the universe only ever wants more. It doesn\u0027t care about sacrifice and best efforts. It needs us to keep fighting. As far as the universe is concerned, there\u0027s no rest for either the good or the wicked. I doubt it even understands the concept.\" \"Well, the universe can go stick its head where the sun don\u0027t shine!\" I yell. \"I\u0027m through. I did what I had to and now I want out, like Bec.\" \"It\u0027s not within my power to let you go or keep you,\" Beranabus says softly. \"Your conscience will guide you. There\u0027s no point shrieking at me. It\u0027s yourself you should be angry with. If you were selfish, didn\u0027t care about the world, or were a tenth of the coward you believe you are, you\u0027d go back inside, return to school, live out a long, happy, simple, human life. Which you\u0027re fully entitled to.\" He takes a step closer, shaking his head. \"But you can\u0027t, can you? You saw the shadow monster in the cave, the one that almost broke through-their leader.\" \"It was huge,\" I whisper. \"Powerful. Evil.\" \"All demons are evil,\" Beranabus says. \"This was different. I\u0027m not sure how exactly, but I intend to find out. I\u0027ll track it down, even if I have to visit a thousand worlds and kill a million demons. Normally Kernel could lead me to it-he\u0027s a marvel at finding rogue monsters-but I\u0027m not sure he can pull his weight anymore.\" \"I might not be able to pull my weight,\" Kernel growls, \"but I can punch your lights out, old man.\" He bares his teeth. \"Or should I say old demon.\" Beranabus laughs shortly. \"Whether or not Kernel can work his magic, I\u0027ll find and kill that beast before it discovers another way to open a tunnel between universes. And you\u0027ll help me. I know it, Kernel knows it-and you know it. That\u0027s why you\u0027re angry. You don\u0027t have a choice because your conscience is directing you. Even after all that\u0027s happened-the grief you\u0027re going through, the guilt, the fear-you have to do this. You couldn\u0027t live with yourself if you didn\u0027t.\" \"Can\u0027t we wait?\" I cry. \"Leave it a few days at least, so I can mourn Bill-E and be with Dervish?\" \"The Demonata won\u0027t wait,\" Beranabus says, then smiles faintly. \"It\u0027s hard for all of us. Kernel needs medical aid. We can build a new pair of eyes for him in the universe of magic, but they\u0027ll only work in that demonic realm. When he returns to this world, the eyes will soon dissolve. The pain will be awful and will worsen every time he comes back. He can no longer think of Earth as home. \"I want to sit down with Bec, tell her all that\u0027s happened in the last thousand and a half years, discuss old times, get to know her again, guide her through the ways of this new and frightening world. Retire and enjoy a few years of peace in her company before my exhausted old spirit passes on. \"But Kernel\u0027s ruined eyes don\u0027t matter a damn. My pitiful wishes matter even less. We\u0027re pawns of the universe. We go where we\u0027re needed, do what we must. All else takes second place to that.\" \"I know,\" I sigh. \"I understand. But Dervish... Bill-E...\" \"Look at it this way,\" Kernel says softly. \"You can mourn your brother here and wait for the world to end-or you can mourn him in the Demonata\u0027s universe while you kick seven shades of demon arse all the way to hell.\" He pushes himself up and walks to the monolith, wincing from the pain, hands outstretched. He touches the dark face of the window, pauses, lifts his head as though trying to see the sky one last time, even without his eyes and through the layers of bandages. Then, with a soft groan, he steps forward and vanishes. \"I want to say goodbye to Dervish,\" I mutter. \"No,\" Beranabus replies, \"you don\u0027t. That would mean more pain. Better to slip away while he\u0027s asleep. He won\u0027t like it, but he\u0027ll accept it.\" \"How\u0027s he going to explain Bill-E\u0027s disappearance to the police, his teachers, everyone who knew him?\" \"He\u0027ll cook up a good story. He was always adept at making fiction fit the facts.\" Beranabus extends a hand towards me. \"What about the cave?\" I ask, stalling for time. \"We have to block the entrance again or the Demonata might-\" \"I\u0027ve already taken care of that,\" Beranabus says curtly, losing patience. \"I\u0027ve cast spells of warning again, and Dervish will ensure the entrance is filled in as swiftly as possible.\" \"Your spells didn\u0027t work last time,\" I remind him. \"Because of the Kah-Gash,\" he snaps. \"That has the power to override any spell of mine or any other\u0027s. But with you and Kernel by my side, I won\u0027t have to worry about that happening again. If demons make another move on the cave, I\u0027ll know. Now, are you coming or not? And before you answer, don\u0027t forget the Lambs are still after you.\" I sneer. \"They frightened me once-not any longer.\" \"Aye. Because you have a more powerful enemy to face now.\" I nod slowly, reluctantly, then take the ancient magician\u0027s hand. \"I\u0027m scared,\" I whisper. \"More scared than I\u0027ve ever been, and that\u0027s saying a lot.\" \"I know,\" he replies quietly. \"You probably always will be. If it\u0027s any comfort, I\u0027m scared too, even after all these centuries.\" \"How do you deal with the fear?\" I ask. He shrugs. \"I fight.\" \"Is that enough?\" \"It has to be.\" And on that dubious, dark note, we walk to the monolith, the magician and his assistant, saviours of the world, slaves of the universe. We lay our hands on the smooth black slab. There\u0027s a surge of magic. Our heads tilt back like Kernel\u0027s did, for one final look at a beautiful, twinkling, star-studded sky. I think of Dervish, Bill-E, all I have to leave behind. The battles to come, the loneliness and pain. I want to run away from it all and hide. But I can\u0027t. No-I won\u0027t. Beranabus tugs gently. I take a breath, hold it, then willingly step forward with him to face my destiny in the universe of all things foul and demonic.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/demon-apocalypse-the-demonata-6/page-17.html","bookId":2180,"book":{"id":2180,"title":"Demon Apocalypse (The Demonata #6)","description":"Storyline: Demon Apocalypse (The Demonata #6) One boy\u0027s life ripped to shreds before his eyes...
