{"id":99708,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"The sweetness of a hard-won victory lasts all of two seconds. Maybe three. Then it hits me-the rocks within and around the crack are still pulsing. The lights are flashing more vibrantly than at a disco. The wind is growing stronger.\n \"Beranabus!\" I yell. \"Why isn\u0027t it stopping?\"\n \"It is,\" he mutters, staring at the crack doubtfully. \"It must be. We killed her. But sometimes it can take a minute for a body to properly die, for all the senses to expire. When the last spark of life flickers out in her, this will end.\"\n \"But if the demons cross before that...\" Beranabus shrugs, then winces and reaches back to try and heal the wounded flesh between his shoulder blades. His skin and eyes are normal now. He looks like a tired old man, not a mighty magician. \"A few might squeeze through, but not many. We\u0027ll just have to-\"\n \"Imbeciles,\" Lord Loss snorts. He glares at Beranabus, then Dervish, who\u0027s lying close by Juni. Her face has lost its glamour, changed back to its real appearance, scarred and bloody from the beating she took. Dervish is staring at her with a mix of horror and loss. \"You think you have defeated us? You believe we fall that easily? You are arrogant and ignorant, Beranabus, the result of too many soft victories over lesser demons. Killing Juni won\u0027t save your pitiful excuse of a world-or your lives. It only makes me more determined to see you and the grotesque Gradys suffer slowly and agonisingly.\"\n \"We were wrong!\" I roar. \"The key wasn\u0027t Juni. It\u0027s one of the demons.\" I spin, trying to figure out whether it\u0027s Artery or Spine.\n \"It can\u0027t be,\" Beranabus pants, struggling to his feet. \"It doesn\u0027t work that way, and we saw them both in the future.\"\n \"Then I was right,\" Lord Loss hisses. \"You travelled back in time!\" He stares at Beranabus, awestruck. \"How did you do it? I thought that, of all things, was impossible. How-\"\n \"Beranabus,\" I interrupt. \"We have to kill them now, before the Demonata-\"\n \"But it\u0027s not them,\" he insists. \"We saw them.\"\n \"Then somebody else!\" I holler. \"Another human assistant, invisible, hidden by magic. We have to find him... her... whatever!\"\n Beranabus nods and stumbles away, feverishly scouring the cave with magic and his eyes. I start off in the opposite direction.\n \"Grubbs,\" Bill-E moans, crawling towards me, wind snapping at him, clothes and hair rippling, the crack threatening to suck him in.\n \"Not now. Dervish.\" My uncle doesn\u0027t respond. \"Dervish!\" I yell. He blinks and looks up. \"The key\u0027s still alive. It wasn\u0027t Juni. We have to find the person who made the sacrifice. If we don\u0027t, the tunnel will-\"\n \"Grubbs,\" Bill-E moans again.\n \"Stop bugging me!\" I scream, then stoop to look him in the eyes. \"I\u0027m sorry but there isn\u0027t time. If we don\u0027t find the person who made the sacrifice, they\u0027ll merge with the rock and the demons will flood through and kill us all.\"\n I stand. Bill-E clutches the sodden, straggly left leg of my makeshift trousers. I curse and kick his hand away. I\u0027m turning to continue searching when he whispers something, too soft for me to decipher. I almost don\u0027t pause, but there\u0027s an urgency in the whisper that demands attention.\n \"What did you say?\" I shout without looking down, eyes piercing the shadows of the cave. It\u0027s difficult to see. The lights inside the crack are throbbing more brightly, changing colour swiftly. Bill-E repeats himself, but again too softly for the words to carry. \"Speak up, damn it. I don\u0027t have time for-\"\n \"I think the key might be me,\" Bill-E croaks.\n And for the second time within the space of an hour the world appears to stop.\n Staring at Bill-E. Certain I heard him wrong. Praying that if I heard him right, I misunderstood. \"What?\" I wheeze.\n \"I think... it wasn\u0027t intentional... I\u0027m not sure... but...\"\n He wasn\u0027t one of the dead, a voice inside my head murmurs. In the future, when you looked into the hole, you didn\u0027t see Bill-E. Dervish was there, Reni, most of the other people you cared about. But not your brother.\n \"Oh dear,\" Lord Loss snickers, floating out of reach, expression twisting with malicious joy. \"The penny drops at long, painful last.\"\n \"No,\" I gasp, the syllable whipped from my lips by the wind. \"It can\u0027t be.\"\n \"Grubbs?\" Dervish asks, seeing something fearful in my face.\n \"Grubbs!\" Beranabus roars. He\u0027s a long way off. Doesn\u0027t know what\u0027s going on. \"Make yourself busy, boy. We have to find the killer. There isn\u0027t much time left.\"\n \"But you\u0027ve already found him, haven\u0027t you, Grubitsch?\" Lord Loss teases.\n \"You\u0027re lying,\" I snarl.\n Lord Loss shakes his head. \"I never lie.\"\n Bill-E falls flat on his stomach and slides towards the crack. Dervish grabs him and holds tight. I crouch beside them, ignoring Lord Loss\u0027s laughter and the bite of the demonic wind. I can hear the cries and chitterings of other demons, coming from a universe that isn\u0027t our own. I tune them out and focus on Bill-E. He\u0027s utterly terrified. I smile at him and even though the smile\u0027s weak, he finds comfort in it, and in spite of his terror, he speaks.\n \"It was Loch,\" he mutters. \"I hated the way he teased me, always making me feel small and worthless. He was a bully. You should have stood up to him, Grubbs. You\u0027re my big brother.\"\n \"I didn\u0027t want to fight your battles for you.\" I sense what he\u0027s going to tell me and I feel like crying, but tears won\u0027t come. I can\u0027t let them.\n \"Always teasing,\" Bill-E says sourly. \"Making fun of me. Any excuse to take a dig. That day when we discovered the cave... you were sick... me and Loch went climbing in search of Lord Sheftree\u0027s treasure...\"\n It seems a lifetime ago. Did we really engage in such playful, innocent games? Was there truly a time when buried treasure seemed important, when a school bully was our only concern? Or did we dream it all?\n \"I saw a chance to get my own back,\" Bill-E continues, voice breaking. \"We were near the top of the waterfall. He slipped and grabbed hold of a rock. He was clinging on by his fingertips. I stuck my hand out. He snatched for it. But then I... I... I whipped my hand away!\"\n Bill-E and I lock expressions. We both understand what he means. Dervish doesn\u0027t. He never saw Loch doing that very same thing to Bill-E at school, making him look like a fool in front of everybody. He\u0027s staring at us as if we\u0027re mad.\n \"I whipped it away,\" Bill-E says numbly. \"Put my thumb on my nose. Said, \u0027Touch¨¦, sucker!\u0027 Stuck my tongue out. I didn\u0027t mean for him to fall. I just wanted to have a laugh. But he lost his grip. Fell before I could help him. Hit his head on the ground. His skull cracked open. He...\"\n Bill-E stops. His face is white. He\u0027s trembling. The wind pulls strongly at him-more strongly than at me, Dervish or anybody else in the cave.\n \"No,\" I say calmly. \"You didn\u0027t kill him. It wasn\u0027t a sacrifice. You aren\u0027t the key.\" But I know it\u0027s not true. Even as I deny it, I know.\n \"Grubbs,\" Dervish wheezes. \"What are you saying? What does it mean? Are you mad? You think Billy caused this?\"\n \"No,\" I lie. \"Of course not.\" But putting the pieces together inside my head. The death-not an accident. Loch\u0027s blood vanishing into the floor of the cave. I\u0027d forgotten about that, but I remember now, the bare floor, wondering where all the blood had gone. Now I know-sucked up by magic. Taken as sacrificial blood, even though it wasn\u0027t intended to be.\n Bill-E guilty. By the strictest letter of the law he killed Loch Gossel and the magic in this cave is holding him accountable. I should have suspected sooner. Beranabus kept a tight watch on the cave when he arrived. He couldn\u0027t understand how Juni slipped past him and made a sacrifice. Never suspected Bill-E. Took me at my word when I told him we were alone, that Loch died accidentally.\n The demons had it easy. No need to slaughter one of their mages, or even enter the cave and risk alerting Beranabus. A sweet deal. The sacrifice had already been made. All Lord Loss and Juni had to do was turn up a few weeks later, chant the correct spells and make sure the killer was present.\n Except they didn\u0027t know who that was. They thought it was me, that the beast or my magic made me murder. That\u0027s why Juni sent me to the cave the night I turned, why she took my blood and smeared the edges of the crack with it. When that failed to produce a reaction, they realised Bill-E must be the guilty one. So Juni hurried over to his house, to haul him in. Nothing personal. It wasn\u0027t for revenge. Lord Loss wanted Bill-E solely for business. And he never meant to kill him. He had other plans for the younger Grady brother.\n The wind increases. Dervish has to dig his heels in hard to hold Bill-E back. He looks at me, panicking. \"Grubbs! What can we do?\"\n That tells me he knows too and understands what must be done. He just doesn\u0027t want to admit it, because that would place the burden on him. He doesn\u0027t want the responsibility. Well, too bad-I don\u0027t want it either.\n \"Bill-E\u0027s the key,\" I tell him.\n \"No,\" Dervish protests, but weakly, unconvincingly.\n \"Grubbs!\" Beranabus yells. \"I hear them coming. What the hell are-\"\n \"Bill-E\u0027s the key!\" I scream and Beranabus gawps at me. \"He made the sacrifice. He didn\u0027t mean to. It was an accident. But-\"\n \"You don\u0027t know what you\u0027re saying,\" Dervish hisses.\n I look at him miserably. \"Yes I do.\"\n \"What\u0027s wrong?\" Bill-E mutters, glancing from one of us to the other. \"This is good, isn\u0027t it? Now that we know, we can cast a spell to stop it, can\u0027t we? Or... should I have kept my big mouth... shut?\"\n \"No,\" I smile. \"You did the right thing. Everything will be OK now. We can stop the demons. You\u0027re a hero. You\u0027ve shown us the way to win.\"\n Bill-E beams proudly. Dervish is staring at me awfully, trembling, gripping his chubby nephew tight. I turn hopelessly to Beranabus, maintaining the smile until I\u0027m facing away from Bill-E, so he can\u0027t see the anguish in my eyes. \"Is there another way?\" I cry.\n \"No,\" Beranabus says, no pity in his voice, just determination. He starts across the cave, fingers flexing. But he\u0027s taken no more than three or four steps when Lord Loss drops into his path and fires a bolt of magic at him, forcing him back.\n \"No, no, no, Beranabus,\" the demon master coos. \"I won\u0027t allow you to spoil such a fascinating scene. This is tremendous sport. Uncle and brother speared on the horns of a most gruelling dilemma. What excruciating entertainment!\"\n Beranabus tries to respond with a magic bolt of his own, but Lord Loss hits him first. The magician collapses, defences crumbling, all washed up.\n The wind is a storm now. Bill-E\u0027s feet are rising into the air. Dervish won\u0027t be able to hold him much longer. Another minute, maybe less, then Bill-E will be torn into the crack, his flesh will join with the rock and he\u0027ll become a living tunnel between this universe and the Demonata\u0027s.\n \"Dervish!\" I scream.\n \"I can\u0027t.\"\n \"But the demons...\"\n \"I know. But I can\u0027t.\" He pulls Bill-E to his chest and wraps both arms around him, fighting the storm, tears coursing down his cheeks.\n \"Grubbs,\" Bill-E grunts, jerking his head clear. \"What\u0027s happening? What do we have to do?\"\n \"Dervish,\" I say steadily, ignoring the question. \"If you don\u0027t, we\u0027ll all die. Everybody else too. Including Bill-E. We can\u0027t save him.\"\n \"You do it then,\" Dervish challenges me.\n \"No. He\u0027s my brother.\"\n \"Do what?\" Bill-E howls as Dervish and I glare at one another.\n Then the fingers of Dervish\u0027s right hand creep up Bill-E\u0027s back. They stop at his neck and spread, gripping the flesh tight. He hasn\u0027t broken eye contact with me. I\u0027m crying, unable to hold back the tears any longer. Bill-E doesn\u0027t know what\u0027s happening. He looks at me, forehead creased, trying to make sense of this. I hope he doesn\u0027t. Better if he never knows, if Dervish does it quickly and it comes as a short, sharp surprise.\n His right hand in place, Dervish moves his left hand up. I don\u0027t know if he means to choke Bill-E or snap his neck. And I never find out. Because the fingers halt halfway up Bill-E\u0027s spine.\n \"I can\u0027t,\" Dervish says quietly, and this time the words are the confession of a broken man.\n \"I knew it,\" Lord Loss laughs. \"Humans are so predictable. Even though all else must fall, you cannot bring yourself to harm your beloved nephew. You\u0027ll damn yourself, him, the whole world, all because of misplaced love.\" He sighs happily. \"Moments such as these make the long, monotonous millennia worthwhile.\"\n Dervish moans and clutches Bill-E close, planning to hug him as long as he can, to maybe get sucked into the crack with him, so the pair can perish together. Except Bill-E won\u0027t die. He\u0027ll become something terrible and twisted, inhuman and beastlike.\n I think of Bill-E suffering, captive within the rock, alive down here indefinitely, wracked with guilt, a plaything for the Demonata when all the other humans have been slaughtered. They\u0027ll torment him. Guilt will eat him whole. Madness will be his only escape, but the demon masters will use magic to restore his senses, to torture him afresh. An eternity of misery, madness and sorrow.\n I can\u0027t let that happen.\n Entering this cave, I realised I couldn\u0027t kill Dervish or Bill-E if they were in league with Lord loss, not even to save the world. I still can\u0027t. But to save Bill-E from a fate genuinely worse than death... for my brother\u0027s sake, as opposed to the sake of billions of others who mean nothing to me...\n \"Bill-E.\" I lean forward, smiling. \"Want to help me kick the crap out of these demon creeps?\"\n Bill-E returns the smile. \"Now you\u0027re talking! What do we have to do?\"\n \"Grubbs,\" Dervish groans.\n \"Shut up,\" I snap, then smile at Bill-E again. \"Take my hands, little brother. Close your eyes. Focus on...\" I gulp. \"Your mum. Think of your mother.\"\n \"How can that help?\" he asks doubtfully.\n \"It\u0027ll clear your head of bad thoughts and fear,\" I improvise. \"I need your help to stop this. But I can only do it if you\u0027re calm. It won\u0027t be easy, but you have to try. Think of your mum and every good time you ever shared. That will generate a positive energy which I can channel. I can use that power to stop the demons.\"\n \"Brilliant!\" Bill-E gasps, face lighting up. He sticks his hands out, shuts his eyes and concentrates, lids twitching, eyeballs rolling behind them as he searches his memories for cherished moments. He trusts me completely.\n Lord Loss has drifted closer. He could stop this, kill or delay me, but he\u0027s entranced. He\u0027s forgotten his mission of all-conquering mayhem. Living only for the bittersweet pain of the moment. Dervish has lowered his face to Bill-E\u0027s shoulder, diverting his gaze. I can\u0027t see Beranabus, Kernel, Spine or Artery. I don\u0027t care. There\u0027s only Bill-E and me in the world now. We\u0027re all that matters.\n I let magic build within me, then reach out to take Bill-E\u0027s hands. I stop. A moment of doubt and disbelief. I can\u0027t do this! Then I look over Bill-E\u0027s head. I see claws coming out of the crack. A massive, shadowy cloud of a face, pure evil. Every shade of darkness imaginable. It fills the gap entirely. I\u0027m not sure what it is-no ordinary demon, that\u0027s for sure-but I know it exists only to destroy, and will unless it\u0027s stopped.\n \"I love you, Bill-E,\" I whisper, my heart breaking. And take his hands.\n Magic flows from me into my brother. Soft, warm, pleasing energy. His smile spreads slowly from the warmth of the magic or an especially fond memory.\n Maybe both. The face of shadows within the crack splits with hatred. It hisses-the sound of a sea boiling dry. Tendrils of darkness dart towards me, a thousand writhing snakes, intent on tearing me away from my brother, separating us forever, using Bill-E for their own evil ends.\n \"Time to fly, little brother,\" I sob, and quickly push. The energy touches Bill-E\u0027s heart and stops it instantly. No pain. Bill-E\u0027s smile freezes in place. The tendrils of darkness blow apart. A furious, hateful bellow as the shadowy face disintegrates. Screams within the crack from scores of cheated demons. The wind stops dead and the howl is replaced by the noise of rocks grinding together as the crack closes. The screams rise sharply, then die away.\n It\u0027s over.\n I lean forward. Put my lips to my dead brother\u0027s forehead and kiss him, my tears dropping on to his still warm flesh. Then I hug him and Dervish tight, and pray for Lord Loss to kill me swiftly, before I lose my mind to wretched, soul-destroying grief. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/demon-apocalypse-the-demonata-6/page-15.html","bookId":2180,"book":{"id":2180,"title":"Demon Apocalypse (The Demonata #6)","description":"Storyline: \n Demon Apocalypse (The Demonata #6) \n One boy\u0027s life ripped to shreds before his eyes...
