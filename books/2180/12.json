{"id":99705,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"At first I think the world and universe have been utterly destroyed and I\u0027m just imagining the laughter. But then the blackness clears slightly. I realise I have eyes again. Blinking, I look around, but can\u0027t make out much. It\u0027s night and I\u0027m in the middle of a cluster of trees. It\u0027s not especially dark-the gleam of a full moon seeps through the branches of the trees-but it\u0027s hard to adjust or focus. My mind\u0027s spinning crazily in a bewildered whir.\\n\\n \"What happened?\" Beranabus croaks, rising from a spot nearby. Kernel lies at the magician\u0027s feet, groaning, cradling his head in his hands. \"Where are we?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" I whisper. My ears are searching for something. I\u0027m not sure what it is, until after a few seconds it sinks in-the girl\u0027s voice has gone.\\n\\n Kernel mutters something, then bolts upright, screaming. \"My eyes!\" he howls. \"The maggots! My eyes! I can\u0027t-\"\\n\\n Beranabus covers his assistant\u0027s mouth and whispers words of magic, a spell to ease the pain. Kernel thrashes wildly, then regains control and stops struggling, though his chest continues to rise and fall rapidly.\\n\\n Beranabus removes his hand. \"Are you going to be all right?\"\\n\\n \"My eyes...\" Kernel moans.\\n\\n \"Gone,\" Beranabus says bluntly.\\n\\n \"But... we must... there has to be some way...\"\\n\\n \"No. They\u0027re ruined. But don\u0027t worry-magic will compensate. You won\u0027t be entirely helpless.\" Beranabus squeezes the back of Kernel\u0027s neck. \"We might even be able to knock together a pair of replacements when we return to the demon universe. If the gods are truly with us, you\u0027ll still be able to see the patches of light and create windows.\"\\n\\n \"Like I give a damn about that!\" Kernel snaps sourly, but Beranabus ignores the hostility.\\n\\n \"Peace for a few minutes,\" the magician says. \"I need to determine where we are.\"\\n\\n He turns in a slow circle, eyes closed, breathing softly, trying to pinpoint our position. I know I should keep silent and wait for him to finish, but I can\u0027t. \"What did she do to us? The ground breaking apart and rising... the sky and funnel... the lights and windows... the noise and pain. What was all that about?\"\\n\\n \"How should I know?\" Beranabus growls. \"Maybe she was trying to destroy the demons and the spell got out of hand.\"\\n\\n \"But the sky! Did you see it? How did she do that? What-\"\\n\\n \"Quiet!\" Beranabus barks, opening an eye to glare at me. \"How can I concentrate with you throwing stupid questions at me?\"\\n\\n \"But she tore up the ground!\" I shout. \"She reversed gravity and brought the sky crashing down. And then she sent us... where? Is this Earth? A demon world? Are we dead?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" Beranabus sighs. \"I don\u0027t know where this is or how she sent us here- teleportation, I suppose, but I\u0027ve never seen it done that way before. But I know why she did it.\" He hesitates, then opens the other eye and looks at me with a shamed grimace. \"I made another mistake. There have been far too many lately. I missed the sacrifice being made in the cave. I was wrong about Lord Loss not wanting to reopen the tunnel. And now I know my plan to close it was flawed.\\n\\n \"I told the Disciples that if we collapsed the walls of the tunnel, victory would be ours. The demons would be sucked back to their own universe. That\u0027s how it happened in the past. I assumed the rules would apply the same way in the present.\\n\\n \"Bec told me they wouldn\u0027t.\"\\n\\n \"You mean, even if we\u0027d succeeded, we wouldn\u0027t have got rid of the demons?\" I ask quietly.\\n\\n \"We\u0027d have stopped others from crossing,\" he says. \"And those here would have lost much of their power. But the world has changed. There\u0027s less magic in the air. My spells wouldn\u0027t have dislodged the demons. The masters would have remained and even weakened they\u0027d have had enough strength to crush humanity. I don\u0027t think all of the Demonata were aware of that-they certainly didn\u0027t act like they were-but Bec knew we were doomed. To spare us, she worked a spell with you and Kernel to get us out, so we could regroup and try again.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s there to try?\" I sob. \"If we couldn\u0027t send them back this time, with all the Disciples to back us up... if destroying the tunnel won\u0027t work...\"\\n\\n \"There must be a way,\" Beranabus mutters. \"That\u0027s why I have to focus. Time\u0027s precious. Bec gave the demons a taste of their own hellish magic, but there\u0027s no guarantee that those sucked up into the sky are dead. Even if they are, the tunnel\u0027s still open. More can cross. We need to return and block their way. So be quiet and let me get my bearings. You can ask all the questions you want after that.\"\\n\\n He closes his eyes and turns again, reaching out with all his senses. Kernel has dragged himself away to sit against a tree. He\u0027s exploring the empty sockets of his eyes with trembling fingers, picking out some dead maggots caught in the corners. I hobble over to check on him, to help if I can, to comfort him if he\u0027ll let me.\\n\\n Then I see the rocks.\\n\\n My eyes have adjusted and the light from the moon is strong, even under the cover of the trees. I can\u0027t miss the rocks. They lie scattered everywhere, but a lot are piled up on my left in a large mound. They can\u0027t be real. It isn\u0027t possible. I must be imagining them. Except I\u0027m not. The magic inside me says they\u0027re genuine. It\u0027s smug. Confident. Triumphant.\\n\\n \"Beranabus.\"\\n\\n \"Grubbs!\" he yells angrily. \"I told you not to-\"\\n\\n \"I know where we are.\"\\n\\n He opens his eyes a fraction, suspiciously. \"Where?\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t need magic. Just look.\" I point to the rocks.\\n\\n Beranabus frowns. Then he realises he\u0027s seen the mound before and his jaw drops. \"No,\" he croaks. \"It can\u0027t be. This is a trick. Or somewhere that looks like...\"\\n\\n \"No.\" I walk across, pick up one of the smaller rocks, then lob it down the hole on the other side of the mound-the mouth of an all too familiar cave. \"We haven\u0027t gone anywhere. We\u0027re still in Carcery Vale.\"\\n\\n Beranabus is striding around the hole, squinting at it, studying it from every possible angle. Every so often he stops, mumbles to himself, shuffles towards the hole, then starts marching again.\\n\\n I\u0027m with Kernel. I\u0027ve wiped away the worst of the muck from around his eyes, using leaves and forest water. \"How are you feeling?\" I ask.\\n\\n \"There\u0027s not much pain,\" he says, \"but there will be. You can delay it in circumstances like these, but not indefinitely. I\u0027ll need hospital treatment when the spell wears off. Assuming any hospitals are left...\" His head turns left, then right. \"Is it day or night?\"\\n\\n \"Night.\"\\n\\n \"I thought so. But it was day when we attacked. I didn\u0027t think I\u0027d been unconscious that long.\"\\n\\n \"You weren\u0027t.\"\\n\\n \"Then...\" He leaves the question hanging.\\n\\n \"We don\u0027t know,\" I tell him. \"Beranabus is trying to figure it out.\"\\n\\n Kernel nods slowly. \"How do I look?\" he asks.\\n\\n I stare into the vacant pits where his eyes once were. They\u0027re peppered with dead maggots. A few are only half visible, their heads and upper bodies buried in the dark flesh and bone of his sockets. \"Fine,\" I lie.\\n\\n Beranabus begins to laugh. I think he\u0027s laughing at my lie and I turn on him angrily. But then I see that he didn\u0027t even hear what I said.\\n\\n \"Of course,\" he chortles. \"It\u0027s the only answer. There\u0027s just one way she could have channelled that much power, to such an effect. You and Bec are the other two pieces. That\u0027s the only thing that makes...\"\\n\\n He mumbles his way back into silence. I say nothing, waiting for him to get it clear in his head, so he can explain it to me in simple terms. I study him while I\u0027m waiting. He looks weird minus his beard and hair, naked as the day he was born. I guess I look pretty strange too, as bare and hairless as an egg. I\u0027d feel awkward any other time, but things have gone so crazy within the last hour, I\u0027m not bothered by my ultra-smooth nudity.\\n\\n Beranabus glances up and waves a hand at the trees. Their branches part, granting him an unobstructed view of the moon and surrounding sky. His eyes dart from the moon to the stars. I can practically hear his brain whirring as he performs silent calculations. Then the branches rustle back together and he laughs again. \"I knew it!\"\\n\\n Beranabus bounds over to where Kernel and I are waiting. He crouches beside us, beaming like a proud father whose wife has just given birth. \"The prime rule of magic-anything is possible. It\u0027s the first thing I teach my assistants, but when you\u0027ve been doing it as long as I have, it\u0027s easy to forget your own advice. Just because something hasn\u0027t been done before, and just because the power involved is way beyond that of even the greatest demon master, doesn\u0027t mean it can\u0027t be done. Bec must have realised what she really was. She spent centuries preparing herself, waiting patiently...\\n\\n \"Or maybe she only saw how to do it during the battle. Maybe you were the catalyst, Grubbs. Or Kernel. Though I don\u0027t think so-he came last to the union, didn\u0027t he? I don\u0027t suppose it really matters. Maybe Bec can tell us, assuming she\u0027s...\" He stops. \"Yes, she must be alive-I mean, her ghost must still be here. It has to be. At least, I suppose...\" He trails off into silence again.\\n\\n \"In your own time, Beranabus,\" I mutter impatiently. \"Whenever you\u0027re ready.\"\\n\\n He flashes me a crazy smile. \"This is so extraordinary. Every time I think about it, I discover something new. We\u0027ve taken an immense leap forwards-well, a leap backwards if you want to be pedantic. It\u0027s like going from the first stone wheel to the first manned flight in the space of one incredible day, one amazing spell. This requires years of study and analysis. We have to figure out how the three of you did it, how to control the power, what else we can do. That will-\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m going to hit you if you don\u0027t stop babbling,\" I warn him. \"Tell us what you know-or what you guess,\" I add quickly as he opens his mouth to start telling me he doesn\u0027t know anything really.\\n\\n \"I know you\u0027re in the dark, I know you want answers, just as much as I do. But...\" He stops, focuses, takes a deep breath. \"You asked me a question once, Kernel. It\u0027s a question most Disciples have asked, normally not long after I\u0027ve told them that with magic anything is possible. Can you remember what it was?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m in no mood to solve riddles,\" Kernel sighs. \"I just want my eyes back. Can you do that for me?\"\\n\\n \"Not now,\" Beranabus huffs, waving the question away. \"Think, boy. You were telling me about your early life, the night you created your first window and stepped into the universe of the Demonata. You said all your troubles started then, that if you could go back and stop yourself, everything would be fine. You asked me if-\"\\n\\n \"No!\" Kernel grunts. \"It can\u0027t be.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s what I thought at first,\" Beranabus chuckles.\\n\\n \"But you said we couldn\u0027t!\" Kernel protests.\\n\\n \"And I was right. Nobody ever had, and I didn\u0027t think anyone could. But now we have. You, Bec and Grubbs did it. You broke the final barrier. I never thought it could happen. I gave up on the notion long, long ago. When you\u0027ve seen as much of-\"\\n\\n \"What is it?\" I cut in sharply, furious with ignorance. \"What\u0027s the big secret? What question did Kernel ask?\"\\n\\n \"The one they all ask eventually,\" Beranabus smiles. \"The one you would have put to me if you\u0027d been with me a little longer, when you looked back on all the times you went wrong, wondered how things would have turned out if you\u0027d done this or that differently, gone down one path instead of another.\"\\n\\n Beranabus stops, glances up at the trees and the moon beyond, as if to reconfirm it before saying it out loud. When he looks at me again, the smile\u0027s still there, but shaky, as if he\u0027s not sure whether he should be smiling or not. And he says, very softly, \"Kernel asked me if it was possible to travel back in time.\"\\n\\n A shocked moment of incredulous silence. Then I laugh. \"Good one. You almost had me going. Now quit with the jokes and-\"\\n\\n \"This isn\u0027t a joke,\" Beranabus says.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re trying to tell me we\u0027ve returned to the past, like in some bad science-fiction film?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" Kernel giggles, then hits me with the punchline. \"Like in some very good science-fiction film.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t,\" I mutter. \"Things are mad enough without you two veering off at some ludicrous angle. We need to think about this logically, go through what happened step by step, so we can understand. Wild speculation won\u0027t get us anywhere.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not wild,\" Beranabus says. \"And it\u0027s not speculation. It\u0027s fact.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t accept that. You\u0027re wrong.\"\\n\\n \"How else can you explain this?\" He points to the hole, the rocks, the trees.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s an illusion. Our minds have conjured it up or Bec fed the image to us to spare us the real, grisly truth. It happened to me before, in Slawter. Maybe we\u0027re lying by the cave entrance, unconscious, demons ravaging our bodies, and this is our only way out of the pain. Or we\u0027ve gone into the universe of the Demonata and created this scene ourselves. Hell, maybe we\u0027re dead and this is what we\u0027ve chosen for the afterlife.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re not dead,\" Kernel says. \"And we\u0027re not imagining this. I\u0027d have given myself eyes if we were.\"\\n\\n \"Time travel\u0027s impossible,\" I say slowly, as if explaining something obvious to a young child.\\n\\n \"So is flying,\" Beranabus says, \"but you\u0027ve soared like a bird.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s different,\" I snap. \"What you\u0027re talking about...\" I shake my head.\\n\\n \"How did it happen?\" Kernel asks. \"I believe you, Beranabus-at least I think I do but how? You always said the past was the one thing we could never change.\"\\n\\n \"It is. I mean, it was. Demons can\u0027t do it. Magicians certainly can\u0027t. But the Kah-Gash...\"\\n\\n Kernel draws his breath in sharply. \"Are you sure?\"\\n\\n \"It has to be,\" Beranabus insists. \"The ultimate power... the ability to destroy an entire universe... Why not the potential to reverse time too?\"\\n\\n \"But if you\u0027re right, that means...\"\\n\\n \"Grubbs and Bec were the missing pieces. And there must have only been three. It couldn\u0027t have worked unless all the pieces were assembled. At least I don\u0027t think it could...\" He frowns.\\n\\n \"What the hell are you talking about?\" I hiss. \"What\u0027s a Car Gash?\"\\n\\n \"Kah-Gash,\" Kernel corrects me. He\u0027s trembling, but not from the pain or cold. \"It\u0027s a mythical weapon. You\u0027re meant to be able to destroy a universe with it, ours or the Demonata\u0027s. It was split into an unknown number of pieces millions or billions of years ago. Various demons and magicians have searched for it since then, without success. Thirty years ago we discovered one of the pieces. In me.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027d been implanted with something?\"\\n\\n \"No. I am a piece of the Kah-Gash.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t understand. How can you be part of a weapon? You\u0027re human.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m magical,\" he disagrees. \"The Kah-Gash is a weapon of magic, not physics. It can take the form of anything it chooses.\"\\n\\n I think that through, putting it together with what they were saying a few minutes ago. \"You believe Bec and I are part of this weapon too?\"\\n\\n \"You have to be,\" Beranabus says. \"The stars don\u0027t lie-we\u0027ve gone back in time, to the night the tunnel was reopened. You three did it. We saw it happening. No force in either universe could have accomplished that, except the Kah-Gash.\"\\n\\n \"How?\" Kernel whispers. \"And why? If this is the work of the Kah-Gash, where did it find the energy to alter the flow of time? And why bring us back to this specific moment? Why stop here, not a hundred years ago or a million? Why not shatter the laws of time entirely?\"\\n\\n Beranabus scratches the back of his neck. \"What did you feel when it was happening?\" he asks.\\n\\n Kernel shrugs. \"Great power flowing into me.\"\\n\\n \"From where?\"\\n\\n \"All around.\"\\n\\n \"Grubbs? Can you be any more specific?\"\\n\\n \"The ground,\" I mutter. \"The power came from the rocks, from beneath.\"\\n\\n \"And did it flow into you or through you?\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s the difference?\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027d have exploded if you drew in that much energy and didn\u0027t let it out,\" Beranabus says. \"You had to channel the magic. But where to? The demons? The sky? Where?\"\\n\\n \"The cave,\" Kernel answers after several seconds of thoughtful silence. \"The power came from the ground, then went through us, back down into the rock, to the cave... the tunnel.\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" I agree, thinking back.\\n\\n Beranabus smiles. \"The Kah-Gash-you, Kernel and Bec-acted as a kind of magnifying lens. You drew energy from the tunnel, then focused it back.\" He goes to stroke his beard, realises he doesn\u0027t have one and taps his chin instead. \"I can\u0027t be sure-maybe I never will be-but this is how I think it worked.\\n\\n \"Opening a window between the Demonata\u0027s universe and ours is like making a hole in a dam- matter flows from their universe to ours, generating energy. Space, time, gravity, the forces which hold our universes together... they seep across every time a demon or one of us makes a rip.\\n\\n \"Windows are small, temporary. The energy generated is minimal. But in this case a tunnel was created, open twenty-four hours a day. A huge river of magic flowed through. You three tapped into that. No... you must have done more than tap into it. You...\" He clicks his fingers. \"You rode it! It was like a wave of energy. You caught the wave and rode it back to its source, converting and channelling it at the same time.\"\\n\\n \"Rode it back to its source?\" Kernel echoes. \"You mean back to the universe of the Demonata?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" Beranabus says. \"You followed the wave back in time, transforming it and eradicating it, back to when the tunnel was created.\" He looks at me, his eyes bright with excitement. \"This is the night of the full moon. The night Lord Loss returned to Carcery Vale. The Kah-Gash brought us back in time to the night when the tunnel was reactivated, so that we could prevent it ever being opened in the first place!\"\\n\\n He seizes my hands and squeezes tight. \"Don\u0027t you see? We\u0027ve been given a second chance. Not just to heal the damage done by the demons, but to stop it happening at all.\"\\n\\n \"But... no... it can\u0027t...\" I mutter, head spinning.\\n\\n \"Grubbs,\" Beranabus says softly. \"At this time, Dervish and your brother are still alive. We can help them, but only if we accept this and act fast. Now, are you going to stand there denying what your senses tell you, or are you going to help me save the world and all the people you love?\"\\n\\n And when he puts it like that... \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/demon-apocalypse-the-demonata-6/page-12.html","bookId":2180,"book":{"id":2180,"title":"Demon Apocalypse (The Demonata #6)","description":"Storyline: Demon Apocalypse (The Demonata #6) \\n One boy\u0027s life ripped to shreds before his eyes...
