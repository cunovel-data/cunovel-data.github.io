{"id":99704,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"The demons attack before we touch the ground, screaming hatefully, hurling themselves at us viciously. More pour out of the cave entrance, all manner of foul monsters, multi-limbed, fangs the size of scythes, claws galore, spitting venom, breathing fire-the works!\\n\\n The soldiers bear the brunt of the assault. They spill out of the helicopters and absorb the rush of demons, firing off round after round of bullets which they know will only delay the beasts, buying precious seconds for those of us in the three central helicopters, laying down their lives to help us.\\n\\n As the bloodshed begins, Beranabus claps me hard on the back. Almost before I know what\u0027s happening, I\u0027m out of the helicopter and running, Beranabus slightly ahead of me, Kernel to my right, Shark and Sharmila flanking us. The other ten Disciples fan out. Everyone\u0027s focused on protecting Beranabus, Kernel and me. Even Shark, who\u0027d love to mindlessly lay into the demons, sticks close by, acting only when we come under direct threat.\\n\\n For several seconds we glide through the ranks of Demonata as if they weren\u0027t there. A few challenge us, but the Disciples brush them off without slowing, sending them tumbling out of our way, interested only in clearing a path to the cave. The demons are hell-bent on butchering the soldiers-easy targets for the magical monsters-delighted to have so many new victims drop in on them at once.\\n\\n Then a familiar demon master rises into the air above the cave entrance. My hands clench into fists, nails breaking the flesh of my palms, and the hope that had been forming within me quickly dwindles away.\\n\\n It\u0027s Lord Loss.\\n\\n \"Demonata!\" my old enemy cries, the word piercing my skull and those of everyone and everything around me. \"Beware the Disciples! Block their path or we\u0027ll be returned to our own universe!\"\\n\\n In an instant the battle changes. Every demon shrugs off the attentions of the soldiers and focuses on our small band. Impossible to tell how many there are... a couple of hundred or more. As if breathing in unison, they all snarl at once, then converge.\\n\\n A wave of demons breaks over us sickeningly fast. One moment they\u0027re metres away. The next we\u0027re surrounded. Claws flash, jaws snap, at least a dozen demons to each of us. Three Disciples perish immediately, wrestled to the ground, ripped to pieces. The rest are stranded, cut off from one another, reduced to fighting isolated, individual battles.\\n\\n Shark disappears beneath three lumpy monsters, then reappears a second later, throwing them off with a ball of magical energy, laughing maniacally.\\n\\n Sharmila\u0027s muttering spells frantically, gently touching the demons around her, setting them on fire.\\n\\n The woman with the cane is using it like a gun, shooting bursts of magical bullets at the demons, crushing the heads of others with her mace.\\n\\n Beranabus presses on, ignoring the carnage, intent on making it to the cave. Kernel runs behind him. So do I, legs working automatically, leaping over the struggling demons, Disciples and soldiers, panting hard. I want to flee. The coward inside me wails and pleads with me to retreat. But I think of Dervish and Bill-E, and cling to the belief that they\u0027re alive, that I can save them. That gives me the strength to ignore the craven cries and follow Beranabus and Kernel.\\n\\n A rabbit-shaped demon leaps up in front of Beranabus. I recognise it from the massacre on the plane. It\u0027s Femur, one of Lord Loss\u0027s familiars. It vomits acid at Beranabus\u0027s face. But the magician is prepared and deflects the acid back at Femur. It drenches the demon and eats through its fur and skin. Femur screams and rolls away, tiny paws frantically trying to wipe the burning liquid away from its cheeks and eyes before its head melts down to the bone.\\n\\n The hell-child known as Artery appears, grabs Beranabus\u0027s left leg with his mouth-encrusted hands and bites hard. Beranabus grunts, then kicks Artery as if he was a football, sending him flying over the heads of several other demons.\\n\\n Beranabus staggers on. The cave entrance is within sight. So is Lord Loss, still hovering in the air, all eight arms extended, smiling sorrowfully.\\n\\n A tiger-headed demon latches on to my waist and whirls me around, fangs snapping in search of my throat. The magic within me instinctively sends a wave of electricity through the monster. It turns black, then collapses, synapses sizzling, eyes melting in its sockets.\\n\\n \"Nice work!\" Shark yells, popping up beside me. He\u0027s bleeding from several cuts and one of his ears has been bitten off. \"Came to help, but it looks like you don\u0027t need me.\"\\n\\n \"Beranabus!\" I shout at him. \"You have to help Ber-\"\\n\\n Before I can finish, Shark\u0027s gone, ripped away by a gaggle of demons who swarm over him, antlike. I see a hand... his teeth as he bites... I hear a laugh... then he\u0027s on the ground, covered completely, and I see nothing more of him.\\n\\n I take a stunned step away from where Shark fell and look around, dazed, searching for Beranabus. He\u0027s come to a standstill. A dozen or more demons stand between the magician and the hole. He fires magical bolts at them, but they take his best shots, barely blink, then return fire. There\u0027s no way around. Soon they\u0027ll wear him down and move in to finish him off.\\n\\n Kernel slides to his master\u0027s side and joins the fight. But just as he fires off a few pinkish bolts of his own, the scorpion demon from the plane-Spine-leaps on to his bald, brown head and aims its stinger at his right eye. With a pop the stinger goes in, then comes out wet and glistening. Shrieking with delight, the demon spits out a mouthful of eggs, filling Kernel\u0027s pulpy socket.\\n\\n Kernel screams with agony as the eggs hatch and maggoty insects gnaw at what\u0027s left of his eye, before working their way through to his brain. He wheels away from Beranabus, losing all sense of direction. Spine strikes again and Kernel\u0027s left eye pops too.\\n\\n Something hits me hard in my upper back and I slam to the ground. Claws dig into my flesh. I\u0027m momentarily stunned, unable to use my magic. I feel the end coming and a large part of me welcomes it-anything to break clear of this madness. But then the demon\u0027s thrown from me by a blast of magical power. I sit up, groggy, expecting to find Sharmila or the lady with the cane. But neither woman is anywhere to be seen. I can only see demons and Beranabus struggling against them desperately, hopelessly. Then who...?\\n\\n \"Nobody touches the boy!\" Lord Loss bellows, and I realise I\u0027ve been rescued by the demon master. He catches my eye and his smile broadens. \"I\u0027m saving you for myself, Grubitsch. You escaped on the aeroplane, but you will not wriggle free again.\"\\n\\n The fighting clears around me, demons giving me a wide berth, turning aside to finish off the Disciples and the few remaining soldiers. The path to the hole clears-but it\u0027s also the path to Lord Loss. For a long second I stare at the demon master, hovering, waiting. I want to run away. No point trying to push on-Lord Loss will kill me before I get anywhere near the cave. The wise thing would be to turn tail and-\\n\\n \"No!\" I yell, deciding not to be a coward, to die with everyone else if that\u0027s my destiny, to perish slowly and awfully at the hands of Lord Loss if that\u0027s the cost of failure. But I\u0027m not going to flee. I\u0027m through running. It\u0027s time to fight.\\n\\n I lurch ahead, summoning all my reserves of energy, speaking quickly to the magic within me, saying I know I\u0027ve let it down in the past and held it back, but promising it a free rein now. We\u0027re in this together and I won\u0027t stop until I\u0027m dead or we\u0027ve won. Will it help me?\\n\\n The magic screams back its answer-Hell, yes!-and I feel power grow in the pit of my stomach, greater than any I\u0027ve unleashed before. I don\u0027t know if I\u0027ll prove a match for Lord Loss and his companions, but right now I feel like I can\u0027t be beaten, like I\u0027m the most powerful player here.\\n\\n \"Beranabus!\" I shout, almost at the hole, risking a look back. He\u0027s surrounded by demons. Cursing, I aim a hand at them and let loose the magic. White flames leap from the tips of my fingers. They hit the demons hard and fire streaks through them like lightning. The demons shriek and peel aside, covered by flames they can\u0027t quench, some coming apart at the seams and dying instantly.\\n\\n \"Balor\u0027s eye!\" Beranabus grunts, limping towards me, stooping to pick up the screaming and writhing Kernel, dragging him along. \"I knew you were powerful, but not that powerful!\"\\n\\n \"Oh, yes,\" Lord Loss says overhead. \"Grubitsch is a most remarkable boy. That is why I chose not to fight him in the cave when I first had the opportunity to kill him. I did not care to face him alone in a place of magic.\"\\n\\n \"You were afraid!\" I holler, reaching the mouth of the cave, sneering up at Lord Loss, feeling invincible. For the first time I believe we can do this-we can win!\\n\\n \"Afraid?\" Lord Loss murmurs. \"An ugly word, Grubitsch. And not entirely accurate. I was not afraid to fight you. I merely preferred to do so when the odds were stacked in my favour. After all, why fight by yourself when you can wait for...\" He smiles wickedly and gestures to the hole.\\n\\n I look down and my sense of triumph fizzles out like a live match that\u0027s been dunked in a bucket of water.\\n\\n The tunnel leading down to the cave is full of demons. And I mean full. There are more of the creatures down there than up here. Thousands of evil eyes glint at me. An army of jaws open hungrily to reveal row after row of sharpened teeth. And in the claws of the beast closest to me- Dervish\u0027s severed, lifeless, blood-rimmed head! Another demon holds the hacked-off head of Reni Gossel. Frank Martin. Charlie Rail. Meera Flame. All the people I cared about. Bill-E\u0027s the only one missing-or maybe he\u0027s further back, where I can\u0027t see him.\\n\\n \"I made your friends and family my first priority,\" Lord Loss says proudly as my world burns at the edges and madness swooshes down upon me. \"I told you I would punish you for humiliating me. A dreadful, all-encompassing punishment. This is how I respond to mockery, Grubitsch. Look upon my work and know at last the true, heartless wrath of Lord Loss.\"\\n\\n \"Grubbs!\" Beranabus shouts. \"They don\u0027t matter! Ignore them! We-\"\\n\\n \"Do not disturb the boy,\" Lord Loss interrupts gloomily. \"This is a time for true grief, not false promise and meaningless heroics. Look down, Beranabus. Even an eternal dreamer like you can\u0027t believe in hope now. It\u0027s over. The war has been decided. Mankind has fallen.\"\\n\\n \"Grubbs! We can still...\"\\n\\n The rest of Beranabus\u0027s words are lost to me. Lord Loss is right. We\u0027re finished. There\u0027s no way through. Everyone I knew-dead. Everyone I know who hasn\u0027t already fallen to the Demonata- soon to be dead. And everybody else, the billions of men, women and children spread across the world, whom I\u0027d never have known, even if I\u0027d lived a thousand lifetimes-they\u0027ll all die too.\\n\\n I sink to my knees, the enormity of the moment overwhelming me. Beranabus grabs my right shoulder with one hand-still holding the wailing, thrashing Kernel with the other-and tries jerking me back to my feet. But I stay where I am, tears flowing, dread consuming me, hoping Lord Loss doesn\u0027t drag the torment out too long, praying for him to take pity on me and kill me quickly.\\n\\n I rock back and forth, moaning, glancing around, seeing demons in the throes of celebration, corpses of soldiers and Disciples being passed around like canap¨¦s at a party. Their howls, grunts and chattering start to sound like music to my ears or the chanting of a long, complicated spell. Then I realise-the sound isn\u0027t of demonic origin. It\u0027s coming from somewhere else... from the rocks beneath me.\\n\\n I look down, expecting some new torment of Lord Loss\u0027s. Instead I find the face of the girl- Bec-bulging out of the rock, eyes open, lips moving swiftly. Beranabus sees it too. His fingers go limp on my shoulder as he stares at the face, lost for words, forgetting all about the demons and our foolish quest.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s this?\" Lord Loss frowns. \"Little Bec, present and alert after all these centuries? Impossible. How can her soul have...\" He smiles. \"No matter. She is powerful, Beranabus, even more than you or Grubitsch. But she cannot save you. Trapped in the rocks, she can only mourn your sad passing.\"\\n\\n The girl speaks quicker than ever, her lips a blur. I feel the magic inside me pulse in time with her chanting. I can\u0027t understand her, but the magic does and it swirls around inside me, excited, trying to reach out to her. Since I\u0027ve nothing to lose, I let it have its way. I step back mentally and let the magic and the girl communicate freely. As the pair link in some unknowable way, I feel my own lips moving, the girl\u0027s words becoming mine, like when I was relaying her previous outburst to Beranabus in his cave.\\n\\n \"Come now,\" Lord Loss says, descending gracefully, signalling to the demons around us. \"Enough of this childishness. Surrender, Grubitsch, and I will go easy on you. Well... easier than I planned to.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll never surrender!\" Beranabus roars, coming alive again, releasing me and Kernel, bringing up his hands to engage the demon master in battle.\\n\\n \"Take him,\" Lord Loss says, yawning mockingly. The nearest demons howl and hurl themselves at the magician-then strike against an invisible boundary and bounce back off it.\\n\\n \"Impressive,\" Lord Loss murmurs. \"But how long do you think you can sustain such a barrier, old man?\"\\n\\n \"This isn\u0027t my work,\" Beranabus says, staring at me uncertainly. The girl\u0027s hands have formed now and stick stiffly out of the ground, grey and rocky. I take them, my fingers large and chunky in comparison to hers. We continue to babble, her, me and the magic.\\n\\n Kernel screams as maggots chew their way deeper into his brain. He jerks aside wildly and the demons eagerly grab for him, but he rebounds against the barrier and is hurled to the ground, landing by my knees. Beranabus stoops and puts his fingers to the boy\u0027s forehead. Magic flares. Maggots fall out of Kernel\u0027s bleeding sockets and shrivel, dead before they hit the ground. Kernel moans and slumps unconscious.\\n\\n Beranabus faces me, features alive with hope. \"Let\u0027s go!\" He grasps my elbow. \"If you can maintain this barrier, they can\u0027t stop us getting into the cave. We-\"\\n\\n My head whips towards him and the girl barks something, using my lips. I don\u0027t know what she says, but it brings a groan of desperation from Beranabus. \"No! You can\u0027t tell me that. Not now. Not after all this. Not when we\u0027re so close.\"\\n\\n I\u0027ve no time to ponder his words. My eyes refocus on the girl\u0027s and lock on her peculiar stony pupils. We\u0027re speaking faster, louder, a fierce magical energy building around us, causing all the hairs on my body to stand up, then burn down to their roots. My clothes also burn away. So do Beranabus\u0027s and Kernel\u0027s. Within seconds we\u0027re naked and hairless, and still the energy builds.\\n\\n Lord Loss senses danger. \"Get them!\" he bellows. \"Destroy that barrier! Kill them all!\"\\n\\n The demons scurry to obey, but their efforts are wasted. The barrier repels them casually. The harder they throw themselves against it, the harder they rebound. Bolts of magic are returned with interest, tearing apart those who fired them. They try to claw it to pieces, rip it apart with their teeth, burrow underneath to attack from within the earth, all to no avail.\\n\\n The energy is unbearable. It goes beyond all my notions of normal heat. I think this is what it would be like to hover within the heart of the sun. The rock is melting around the girl\u0027s face, but she remains, more of her form becoming visible as the stone recedes.\\n\\n Screams of panic. With an effort I raise my head. The demons are staring at the sky, horrified and bewildered.\\n\\n Looking up, I see something incomprehensible. The sky is pulsing. It\u0027s like looking at the underside of a trampoline while somebody leaps up and down on top. In the centre, a funnel has formed, as if the universe is being pulled towards one point. As I watch, it throbs low, then pulls up high... low/high... low/high. And it might be my imagination, but it seems as if the tip of the funnel hangs directly over me, Kernel, Beranabus and the ghost girl, Bec.\\n\\n Lights flicker across the distorted sky. Clouds burst into flame. The tip of the funnel pushes lower and lower, ever closer to us. The demons scatter, screeching and keening. Stuff like this happens every day in their own universe. They aren\u0027t bothered by magical madness there. But they didn\u0027t expect it in this universe of order and sanity. They don\u0027t know what it means or how to respond.\\n\\n \"This will not save you!\" Lord Loss shouts none too convincingly. \"Stay, you scum!\" he roars at the fleeing demons. \"Fight! We can break through this barrier and kill them. You must not...\"\\n\\n I tune him out. My lips are my own again during a brief pause in the spell. \"What\u0027s happening?\" I wheeze, directing the question at Beranabus. But he can only shake his head and stare at Bec and me. Then the spell starts again and I can\u0027t ask any more questions. My lips are Bec\u0027s. My magic and her magic-one. Our minds join. I get flashes of her life-a simple farming society, demons, a quest, warriors, a magician, closing the tunnel between worlds, sacrificing herself, trapped in a cave, her spirit somehow separating from her body, dying but not moving on, imprisoned, no way out, haunting the centuries, unable to escape the rocky confines of the cave.\\n\\n Then I\u0027m inside somebody else\u0027s head. I see a small, modern village, thousands of patches of light in the sky around me, a baby that looks oddly familiar, a young punk who... no, surely that\u0027s not Dervish! Yes, it is, a young and spiky-haired Dervish Grady, fighting alongside Shark, Sharmila, Beranabus, a dark-skinned man and...\\n\\n Kernel sits up and groans. He shakes his head groggily. His empty sockets turn left and right as if he\u0027s looking for something. They fix sightlessly on Bec and me. Trembling, moaning with pain, he reaches over and lays his hands on top of mine. My magic shoots out to him, then blasts back stronger than ever, drawing power from the blind teenager. His lips move along with mine and Bec\u0027s, his magic mingling with ours.\\n\\n Our voices rise. The sky turns black, red, white. Rocks are ripping out of the ground, shooting upwards, burning, turning into birds, cows, cars, people, then back into rocks. Now everything\u0027s rising, the ruins of trees and buildings, corpses, the demons. Gravity loses its grip. Lord Loss tries clinging to the invisible barrier around us, but is ripped away and up. He hurls vile curses at us as he shoots off.\\n\\n The world is coming apart. Everything\u0027s being destroyed. I\u0027m afraid now, even more than when I thought the demons had us. Bec must be insane. Sixteen hundred years of captivity have driven her mad. She only wants to ruin, make everybody else suffer as she has suffered, tear the world apart. And she can do it. With my magic and Kernel\u0027s, she has the power to wreak a terrible, misdirected revenge.\\n\\n I try stopping it. I focus on breaking contact, making my lips stop, getting out of here before all is lost. But the magic holds me tight. There\u0027s no escaping. Everything in sight shoots skyward, while the sky itself drops ever further, the tip of the funnel pulsing down... down... down.\\n\\n Beranabus is frightened too. He was exhilarated when he saw the demons get swept away, but this has exploded out of control. He sees what I see-the literal end of the world. He sits on the ground-the only patch left is the bit contained by our bubble of energy-and gawps at the three of us, eyes wide, twin pools of confusion and fear. Maybe he thinks about killing one of us to stop it. But I don\u0027t think he could. He doesn\u0027t have the power.\\n\\n The tip of the funnel is almost upon us. I gear myself up for one last effort, one final push to break the unnatural, destructive bond between me, Kernel and Bec. But before I can attempt anything, the tip of the funnel-blue, like the sky used to be-touches the wall of the invisible boundary.\\n\\n A flash of light which is every colour. My body explodes, or seems to. I have the feeling of being everywhere and nowhere at once, both an entire universe and an insignificant speck. The funnel sucks me into it. Millions of panels of pulsing lights. Flying from one to another, bouncing around, moving so fast I\u0027m creating a vacuum, sucking the tip of the funnel in after me, pulling it along in my wake. Dimly aware of Kernel and Bec\u0027s magic working in tandem with mine.\\n\\n We stop bouncing, but move quicker than ever. A cluster of purple lights flash, then bolt together and become a small window. We shoot through it. Yellow lights flash and join-we fly through. A series of flashing lights and windows, one after the other, faster and faster. Curious, I focus on the magic and realise Kernel\u0027s the one creating the windows and directing us through them. I\u0027ve no idea how or why. I don\u0027t think Kernel knows either.\\n\\n No sense of time or space. Just one window after another, the colours whirring and blurring, a fearsome noise building in the background. Then the lights fade. Unable to see anything now. Total blackness. As blind as Kernel.\\n\\n The noise continues to build, so loud it could crush a continent. My ears burst. My skull cracks. My brain bubbles away to nothing. But that makes no difference. I still exist. I still hear, think and feel. The noise squeezes my soul. Pain that\u0027s indescribable. No way to scream or release the pressure. A universe of agony.\\n\\n Then, suddenly, the noise stops. I come to rest. The pain disappears. Delicious, soothing silence. Broken abruptly by a girl\u0027s delighted laugh. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/demon-apocalypse-the-demonata-6/page-11.html","bookId":2180,"book":{"id":2180,"title":"Demon Apocalypse (The Demonata #6)","description":"Storyline: Demon Apocalypse (The Demonata #6) \\n One boy\u0027s life ripped to shreds before his eyes...
