{"id":101299,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"We began packing up in a quiet and unobtrusive way, since there were still lingering guests.\\n\\n \"As along as we\u0027re talking about dates, what happened to Quinn?\" he asked as we worked. \"You\u0027ve been moping ever since you got back from Rhodes.\"\\n\\n \"Well, I told you he got hurt pretty bad in the bombing.\" Quinn\u0027s branch of E(E)E staged special events for the supe community: vampire hierarchal weddings, Were coming of age parties, packleader contests, and the like. That was why Quinn had been in the Pyramid of Gizeh when the Fellowship did its dirty deed.\\n\\n The FotS people were anti-vampire, but they had no idea that vampires were just the visible, public tip of the iceberg in the supernatural world. No one knew this; or at least only a few people like me, though more and more were in on the big secret. I was sure the Fellowship fanatics would hate werewolves or shapeshifters like Sam just as much as they hated vampires... if they knew they existed. That time might come soon.\\n\\n \"Yeah, but I would have thought...\"\\n\\n \"I know, I would have thought Quinn and I were all set, too,\" I said, and if my voice was dreary, well, thinking about my missing weretiger made me feel that way. \"I kept thinking I\u0027d hear from him. But not a word.\"\\n\\n \"You still got his sister\u0027s car?\" Frannie Quinn had loaned me her car so I could get home after the Rhodes disaster.\\n\\n \"No, it vanished one night when Amelia and I were both at work. I called and left a voice mail on his cell to say it had been taken, but I never heard back.\"\\n\\n \"Sookie, I\u0027m sorry,\" Sam said. He knew that was inadequate, but what could he say?\\n\\n \"Yeah, me, too,\" I said, trying not to sound too depressed. It was an effort to keep from retreading tired mental ground. I knew Quinn didn\u0027t blame me in any way for his injuries. I\u0027d seen him in the hospital in Rhodes before I\u0027d left, and he\u0027d been in the care of his sister, Fran, who didn\u0027t seem to hate me at that point. No blame, no hate - why no communication?\\n\\n It was like the ground had opened to swallow him up. I threw up my hands and tried to think of something else. Keeping busy was the best remedy when I was worried. We began to shift some of our things to Sam\u0027s truck, parked about a block away. He carried most of the heavier stuff. Sam is not a big guy, but he\u0027s really strong, as all shifters are.\\n\\n By ten thirty we were almost finished. From the cheers at the front of the house, I knew that the brides had descended the staircase in their honeymoon clothes, thrown their bouquets, and departed. Portia and Glen were going to San Francisco, and Halleigh and Andy were going to Jamaica to some resort. I couldn\u0027t help but know.\\n\\n Sam told me I could leave. \"I\u0027ll get Dawson to help me unload at the bar,\" he said. Since Dawson, who\u0027d been standing in for Sam at Merlotte\u0027s Bar tonight, was built like a boulder, I agreed that was a good plan.\\n\\n When we divided the tips, I got about three hundred dollars. It had been a lucrative evening. I tucked the money in my pants pocket. It made a big roll, since it was mostly ones. I was glad we were in Bon Temps instead of a big city, or I\u0027d worry that someone would hit me on the head before I got to my car.\\n\\n \"Well, night, Sam,\" I said, and checked my pocket for my car keys. I hadn\u0027t bothered with bringing a purse. As I went down the slope of the backyard to the sidewalk, I patted my hair self-consciously. I\u0027d been able to stop the pink smock lady from putting it on top of my head, so she\u0027d done it puffy and curly and sort of Farrah Fawcett. I felt silly.\\n\\n There were cars going by, most of them wedding guests taking their departure. There was some regular Saturday night traffic. The line of vehicles parked against the curb stretched for a very long way down the street, so all traffic was moving slowly. I\u0027d illegally parked with the driver\u0027s side against the curb, not usually a big deal in our little town.\\n\\n I bent to unlock my car door, and I heard a noise behind me. In a single movement, I palmed my keys and clenched my fist, wheeled, and hit as hard as I could. The keys gave my fist quite a core, and the man behind me staggered across the sidewalk to land on his butt on the slope of the lawn.\\n\\n \"I mean you no harm,\" said Jonathan.\\n\\n It isn\u0027t easy to look dignified and nonthreatening when you have blood running from one corner of your mouth and you\u0027re sitting on your ass, but the Asian vampire managed it.\\n\\n \"You surprised me,\" I said, which was a gross understatement.\\n\\n \"I can see that,\" he said, and got easily to his feet. He brought out a handkerchief and patted his mouth.\\n\\n I wasn\u0027t going to apologize. People who sneak up on me when I\u0027m alone at night, well, they deserve what they get. But I reconsidered. Vampires move quietly. \"I\u0027m sorry I assumed the worst,\" I said, which was sort of a compromise. \"I should have identified you.\"\\n\\n \"No, it would have been too late by then,\" Jonathan said. \"A woman alone must defend herself.\"\\n\\n \"I appreciate your understanding,\" I said carefully. I glanced behind him, tried not to register anything on my face. Since I hear so many startling things from people\u0027s brains, I\u0027m used to doing that. I looked directly at Jonathan. \"Did you... Why were you here?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m passing through Louisiana, and I came to the wedding as a guest of Hamilton Tharp,\" he said. \"I\u0027m staying in Area Five, with the permission of Eric Northman.\"\\n\\n I had no idea who Hamilton Tharp was - presumably some buddy of the Bellefleurs\u0027. But I knew Eric Northman quite well. (In fact, at one time I\u0027d known him from his head to his toes, and all points in between.) Eric was the sheriff of Area Five, a large chunk of northern Louisiana. We were tied together in a complex way, which most days I resented like hell.\\n\\n \"Actually, what I was asking you was - why did you approach me just now?\" I waited, keys still clutched in my hand. I\u0027d go for his eyes, I decided. Even vampires are vulnerable there.\\n\\n \"I was curious,\" Jonathan said finally. His hands were folded in front of him. I was developing a strong dislike for the vamp.\\n\\n \"Why?\"\\n\\n \"I heard a little at Fangtasia about the blond woman Eric values so highly. Eric has such a hard nose that it didn\u0027t seem likely any human woman could interest him.\"\\n\\n \"So how\u0027d you know I was going to be here, at this wedding, tonight?\"\\n\\n His eyes flickered. He hadn\u0027t expected me to persist in questioning. He had expected to be able to calm me, maybe at this moment was trying to coerce me with his glamour. But that just didn\u0027t work on me.\\n\\n \"The young woman who works for Eric, his child Pam, mentioned it,\" he said.\\n\\n Liar, liar, pants on fire, I thought. I hadn\u0027t talked to Pam in a couple of weeks, and our last conversation hadn\u0027t been girlish chatter about my social and work schedule. She\u0027d been recovering from the wounds she\u0027d sustained in Rhodes. Her recovery, and Eric\u0027s, and the queen\u0027s, had been the sole topic of our conversation.\\n\\n \"Of course,\" I said. \"Well, good evening. I need to be leaving.\" I unlocked the door and carefully slid inside, trying to keep my eyes fixed on Jonathan so I\u0027d be ready for a sudden move. He stood as still as a statue, inclining his head to me after I started the car and pulled off. At the next stop sign, I buckled my seat belt. I hadn\u0027t wanted to pin myself down while he was so close. I locked the car doors, and I looked all around me. No vampires in sight. I thought, That was really, really weird. In fact, I should probably call Eric and relate the incident to him.\\n\\n You know what the weirdest part was? The withered man with the long blond hair had been standing in the shadows behind the vampire the whole time. Our eyes had even met once. His beautiful face had been quite unreadable. But I\u0027d known he didn\u0027t want me to acknowledge his presence. I hadn\u0027t read his mind - I couldn\u0027t - but I\u0027d known this nonetheless.\\n\\n And weirdest of all, Jonathan hadn\u0027t known he was there. Given the acute sense of smell that all vampires possessed, Jonathan\u0027s ignorance was simply extraordinary.\\n\\n I was still mulling over the strange little episode when I turned off Hummingbird Road and onto the long driveway through the woods that led back to my old house. The core of the house had been built more than a hundred and sixty years before, but of course very little of the original structure remained. It had been added to, remodeled, and reroofed a score of times over the course of the decades. A two-room farmhouse to begin with, it was now much larger, but it remained a very ordinary home.\\n\\n Tonight the house looked peaceful in the glow of the outside security light that Amelia Broadway, my housemate, had left on for me. Amelia\u0027s car was parked in back, and I pulled alongside it. I kept my keys out in case she\u0027d gone upstairs for the night. She\u0027d left the screen door unlatched, and I latched it behind me. I unlocked the back door and relocked it. We were hell on security, Amelia and I, especially at night.\\n\\n A little to my surprise, Amelia was sitting at the kitchen table, waiting for me. We\u0027d developed a routine after weeks of living together, and generally Amelia would have retired upstairs by this time. She had her own TV, her cell phone, and her laptop up there, and she\u0027d gotten a library card, so she had plenty to read. Plus, she had her spell work, which I didn\u0027t ask questions about. Ever. Amelia is a witch.\\n\\n \"How\u0027d it go?\" she asked, stirring her tea as if she had to create a tiny whirlpool.\\n\\n \"Well, they got married. No one pulled a Jane Eyre. Glen\u0027s vampire customers behaved themselves, and Miss Caroline was gracious all over the place. But I had to stand in for one of the bridesmaids.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, wow! Tell me.\"\\n\\n So I did, and we shared a few laughs. I thought of telling Amelia about the beautiful man, but I didn\u0027t. What could I say? \"He looked at me\"? I did tell her about Jonathan from Nevada.\\n\\n \"What do you think he really wanted?\" Amelia said.\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t imagine.\" I shrugged.\\n\\n \"You need to find out. Especially since you\u0027d never heard of the guy whose guest he said he was.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m going to call Eric - if not tonight, then tomorrow night.\"\\n\\n \"Too bad you didn\u0027t buy a copy of that database Bill is peddling. I saw an ad for it on the Internet yesterday, on a vampire site.\" This might seem like a sudden change of subject, but Bill\u0027s database contained pictures and/or biographies of all the vampires he\u0027d been able to locate all over the world, and a few he\u0027d just heard about. Bill\u0027s little CD was making more money for his boss, the queen, than I could ever have imagined. But you had to be a vampire to purchase a copy, and they had ways of checking.\\n\\n \"Well, since Bill is charging five hundred dollars a pop, and impersonating a vampire is a dangerous risk...\" I said.\\n\\n Amelia waved her hand. \"It\u0027d be worth it,\" she said.\\n\\n Amelia is a lot more sophisticated than I am... at least in some ways. She grew up in New Orleans, and she\u0027d lived there most of her life. Now she was living with me because she\u0027d made a giant mistake. She\u0027d needed to leave New Orleans after her inexperience had caused a magical catastrophe. It was lucky she\u0027d departed when she had, because Katrina followed soon after. Since the hurricane, her tenant was living in the top-floor apartment of Amelia\u0027s house. Amelia\u0027s own apartment on the bottom floor had sustained some damage. She wasn\u0027t charging the tenant rent because he was overseeing the repair of the house.\\n\\n And here came the reason Amelia wasn\u0027t moving back to New Orleans any time soon. Bob padded into the kitchen to say hello, rubbing himself affectionately against my legs.\\n\\n \"Hey, my little honey bunny,\" I said, picking up the long-haired black-and-white cat. \"How\u0027s my precious? I wuv him!\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m gonna barf,\" Amelia said. But I knew that she talked just as disgustingly to Bob when I wasn\u0027t around.\\n\\n \"Any progress?\" I said, raising my head from Bob\u0027s fur. He\u0027d had a bath this afternoon - I could tell from his fluffy factor.\\n\\n \"No,\" she said, her voice flat with discouragement. \"I worked on him for an hour today, and I only gave him a lizard tail. Took everything I had to get it changed back.\"\\n\\n Bob was really a guy, that is, a man. A sort of nerdy-looking man with dark hair and glasses, though Amelia had confided he had some outstanding attributes that weren\u0027t apparent when he was dressed for the street. Amelia wasn\u0027t supposed to be practicing transformational magic when she turned Bob into a cat; they were having what must have been very adventurous sex. I\u0027d never had the nerve to ask her what she\u0027d been trying to do. It was clear that it was something pretty exotic.\\n\\n \"The deal is,\" Amelia said suddenly, and I went on the alert. The real reason she\u0027d stayed up to see me was about to be revealed. Amelia was a very clear broadcaster, so I picked it right up from her brain. But I let her go on and speak, because people really don\u0027t like it if you tell them they don\u0027t have to actually speak to you, especially when the topic is something they\u0027ve had to build up to. \"My dad is going to be in Shreveport tomorrow, and he wants to come by Bon Temps to see me,\" she said in a rush. \"It\u0027ll be him and his chauffeur, Marley. He wants to come for supper.\"\\n\\n The next day would be Sunday. Merlotte\u0027s would be open only in the afternoon, but I wasn\u0027t scheduled to work anyway, I saw with a glance at my calendar. \"So I\u0027ll just go out,\" I said. \"I could go visit JB and Tara. No big.\"\\n\\n \"Please be here,\" she said, and her face was naked with pleading. She didn\u0027t spell out why. But I could read the reason easy enough. Amelia had a very conflicted relationship with her dad; in fact, she\u0027d taken her mother\u0027s last name, Broadway, though in part that was because her father was so well-known. Copley Carmichael had lots of political clout and he was rich, though I didn\u0027t know how Katrina had affected his income. Carmichael owned huge lumberyards and was a builder, and Katrina might have wiped out his businesses. On the other hand, the whole area needed lumber and rebuilding.\\n\\n \"What time\u0027s he coming?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"Five.\"\\n\\n \"Does the chauffeur eat at the same table as him?\" I\u0027d never dealt with employees. We just had the one table here in the kitchen. I sure wasn\u0027t going to make the man sit on the back steps.\\n\\n \"Oh, God,\" she said. This had clearly never occurred to her. \"What will we do about Marley?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s what I\u0027m asking you.\" I may have sounded a little too patient.\\n\\n \"Listen,\" Amelia said. \"You don\u0027t know my dad. You don\u0027t know how he is.\"\\n\\n I knew from Amelia\u0027s brain that her feelings about her father were really mixed. It was very difficult to pick through the love, fear, and anxiety to get to Amelia\u0027s true basic attitude. I knew few rich people, and even fewer rich people who employed full-time chauffeurs.\\n\\n This visit was going to be interesting.\\n\\n I said good night to Amelia and went to bed, and though there was a lot to think about, my body was tired and I was soon asleep.\\n\\n Sunday was another beautiful day. I thought of the newlyweds, safely launched on their new lives, and I thought of old Miss Caroline, who was enjoying the company of a couple of her cousins (youngsters in their sixties) by way of watchdogs and companions. When Portia and Glen returned, the cousins would go back to their more humble home, probably with some relief. Halleigh and Andy would move into their own small house.\\n\\n I wondered about Jonathan and the beautiful withered man.\\n\\n I reminded myself to call Eric the next night when he was up.\\n\\n I thought about Bill\u0027s unexpected words.\\n\\n For the millionth time, I speculated about Quinn\u0027s silence.\\n\\n But before I could get too broody, I was caught up in Hurricane Amelia.\\n\\n There are lots of things I\u0027ve come to enjoy, even love, about Amelia. She\u0027s straightforward, enthusiastic, and talented. She knows all about the supernatural world, and my place in it. She thinks my weird \"talent\" is really cool. I can talk to her about anything. She\u0027s never going to react with disgust or horror. On the other hand, Amelia is impulsive and headstrong, but you have to take people like they are. I\u0027ve really enjoyed having Amelia living with me.\\n\\n On the practical side, she\u0027s a decent cook, she\u0027s careful about keeping our property separate, and God knows she\u0027s tidy. What Amelia really does well is clean. She cleans when she\u0027s bored, she cleans when she\u0027s nervous, and she cleans when she feels guilty. I am no slouch in the housekeeping department, but Amelia is world-class. The day she had a near-miss auto accident, she cleaned my living room furniture, upholstery and all. When her tenant called her to tell her the roof had to be replaced, she went down to EZ Rent and brought home a machine to polish and buff the wooden floors upstairs and downstairs.\\n\\n When I got up at nine, Amelia was already deep in a cleaning frenzy because of her father\u0027s impending visit. By the time I left for church at about ten forty-five, Amelia was on her hands and knees in the downstairs hall bathroom, which admittedly is very old-fashioned looking with its tiny octagonal black-and-white tiles and a huge old claw-footed bathtub; but (thanks to my brother, Jason) it has a more modern toilet. This was the bathroom Amelia used, since there wasn\u0027t one upstairs. I had a small, private one off my bedroom, added in the fifties. In my house, you could see several major decorating trends over the past few decades all in one building.\\n\\n \"You really think it was that dirty?\" I said, standing in the doorway. I was talking to Amelia\u0027s rump.\\n\\n She raised her head and passed a rubber-gloved hand over her forehead to push her short hair out of the way.\\n\\n \"No, it wasn\u0027t bad, but I want it to be great.\"\\n\\n \"My house is just an old house, Amelia. I don\u0027t think it can look great.\" There was no point in my apologizing for the age and wear of the house and its furnishings. This was the best I could do, and I loved it.\\n\\n \"This is a wonderful old home, Sookie,\" Amelia said fiercely. \"But I have to be busy.\"\\n\\n \"Okay,\" I said. \"Well, I\u0027m going to church. I\u0027ll be home by twelve thirty.\"\\n\\n \"Can you go to the store after church? The list is on the counter.\"\\n\\n I agreed, glad to have something to do that would keep me out of the house longer.\\n\\n The morning felt more like March (March in the south, that is) than October. When I got out of my car at the Methodist church, I raised my face to the slight breeze. There was a touch of winter in the air, a little taste of it. The windows in the modest church were open. When we sang, our combined voices floated out over the grass and trees. But I saw some leaves blow past as the pastor preached.\\n\\n Frankly, I don\u0027t always listen to the sermon. Sometimes the hour in church is just a time to think, a time to consider where my life is going. But at least those thoughts are in a context. And when you watch leaves falling off trees, your context gets pretty narrow.\\n\\n Today I listened. Reverend Collins talked about giving God the things that were due him while giving Caesar the things due him. That seemed like an April fifteenth type sermon to me, and I caught myself wondering if Reverend Collins paid his taxes quarterly. But after a while, I figured he was talking about the laws we break all the time without feeling guilty - like the speed limit, or sticking a letter in with some presents in a box you\u0027re mailing at the post office, without paying the extra postage.\\n\\n I smiled at Reverend Collins on my way out of the church. He always looks a little troubled when he sees me.\\n\\n I said hello to Maxine Fortenberry and her husband, Ed, as I reached the parking lot. Maxine was large and formidable, and Ed was so shy and quiet he was almost invisible. Their son, Hoyt, was my brother Jason\u0027s best friend. Hoyt was standing behind his mother. He was wearing a nice suit, and his hair had been trimmed. Interesting signs.\\n\\n \"Sugar, you give me a hug!\" Maxine said, and of course I did. Maxine had been a good friend to my grandmother, though she was more the age my dad would have been. I smiled at Ed and gave Hoyt a little wave.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re looking nice,\" I told him, and he smiled. I didn\u0027t think I\u0027d ever seen Hoyt smile like that, and I glanced at Maxine. She was grinning.\\n\\n \"Hoyt, he\u0027s dating that Holly you work with,\" Maxine said. \"She\u0027s got a little one, and that\u0027s a thing to think about, but he\u0027s always liked kids.\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t know,\" I said. I really had been out of it lately. \"That\u0027s just great, Hoyt. Holly\u0027s a real nice girl.\"\\n\\n I wasn\u0027t sure I would have put it quite that way if I\u0027d had time to think, so maybe it was lucky I didn\u0027t. There were some big positives about Holly (devoted to her son, Cody; loyal to her friends; a competent worker). She\u0027d been divorced for several years, so Hoyt wasn\u0027t a rebound. I wondered if Holly had told Hoyt she was a Wiccan. Nope, she hadn\u0027t, or Maxine wouldn\u0027t be smiling so broadly.\\n\\n \"We\u0027re meeting her for lunch at the Sizzler,\" she said, referring to the steakhouse up by the interstate. \"Holly\u0027s not much of a churchgoer, but we\u0027re working on getting her to come with us and bring Cody. We better get moving if we\u0027re gonna be on time.\"\\n\\n \"Way to go, Hoyt,\" I said, patting his arm as he went by me. He gave me a pleased look.\\n\\n Everyone was getting married or falling in love. I was happy for them. Happy, happy, happy. I pasted a smile on my face and went to Piggly Wiggly. I fished Amelia\u0027s list out of my purse. It was pretty long, but I was sure there\u0027d be additions by now. I called her on my cell phone, and she had already thought of three more items to add, so I was some little while in the store.\\n\\n My arms were weighed down with plastic bags as I struggled up the steps to the back porch. Amelia shot out to the car to grab the other bags. \"Where have you been?\" she asked, as if she\u0027d been standing by the door tapping her toe.\\n\\n I looked at my watch. \"I got out of church and went to the store,\" I said defensively. \"It\u0027s only one.\"\\n\\n Amelia passed me again, heavily laden. She shook her head in exasperation as she went by, making a noise that could only be described as \"Urrrrrrgh.\"\\n\\n The rest of the afternoon was like that, as though Amelia were getting ready for the date of her life.\\n\\n I\u0027m not a bad cook, but Amelia would let me do only the most menial chores in fixing the dinner. I got to chop onions and tomatoes. Oh, yeah, she let me wash the preparation dishes. I\u0027d always wondered if she could do the dishes like the fairy godmothers in Sleeping Beauty, but she just snorted when I brought it up.\\n\\n The house was spanky clean, and though I tried not to mind, I noticed that Amelia had even given the floor of my bedroom a once-over. As a rule, we didn\u0027t go into each other\u0027s space.\\n\\n \"Sorry I went in your room,\" Amelia said suddenly, and I jumped - me, the telepath. Amelia had beaten me at my own game. \"It was one of those crazy impulses I get. I was vacuuming, and I just thought I\u0027d get your floor, too. And before I thought about it, I was done. I put your slippers up under your bed.\"\\n\\n \"Okay,\" I said, trying to sound neutral.\\n\\n \"Hey, I am sorry.\"\\n\\n I nodded and went back to drying the dishes and putting them away. The menu, as decided by Amelia, was tossed green salad with tomatoes and slivered carrots, lasagna, hot garlic bread, and steamed fresh mixed vegetables. I don\u0027t know diddly-squat about steamed vegetables, but I had prepared all the raw materials - the zucchini, bell peppers, mushrooms, cauliflower. Late in the afternoon, I was deemed capable of tossing the salad, and I got to put the cloth and the little bouquet of flowers on the table and arrange the place settings. Four place settings.\\n\\n I\u0027d offered to take Mr. Marley into the living room with me, where we could eat on TV trays, but you would have thought I\u0027d offered to wash his feet, Amelia was so horrified.\\n\\n \"No, you\u0027re sticking with me,\" she said.\\n\\n \"You gotta talk to your dad,\" I said. \"At some point, I\u0027m leaving the room.\"\\n\\n She took a deep breath and let it out. \"Okay, I\u0027m a grown-up,\" she muttered.\\n\\n \"Scaredy-cat,\" I said.\\n\\n \"You haven\u0027t met him yet.\"\\n\\n Amelia hurried upstairs at four fifteen to get ready. I was sitting in the living room reading a library book when I heard a car on the gravel driveway. I glanced at the clock on the mantel. It was four forty-eight. I yelled up the staircase and stood to look out the window. The afternoon was drawing to a close, but since we hadn\u0027t reverted to standard time yet, it was easy to see the Lincoln Town Car parked in front. A man with clipped dark hair, wearing a business suit, got out of the driver\u0027s seat. This must be Marley. He wasn\u0027t wearing a chauffeur\u0027s hat, somewhat to my disappointment. He opened a rear door. Out stepped Copley Carmichael.\\n\\n Amelia\u0027s dad wasn\u0027t very tall, and he had short thick gray hair that looked like a really good carpet, dense and smooth and expertly cut. He was very tan, and his eyebrows were still dark. No glasses. No lips. Well, he did have lips, but they were really thin, so his mouth looked like a trap.\\n\\n Mr. Carmichael looked around him as if he were doing a tax assessment.\\n\\n I heard Amelia clattering down the stairs behind me as I watched the man in my front yard complete his survey. Marley the chauffeur was looking right at the house. He\u0027d spotted my face at the window.\\n\\n \"Marley\u0027s sort of new,\" Amelia said. \"He\u0027s been with my dad for just two years.\"\\n\\n \"Your dad\u0027s always had a driver?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah. Marley\u0027s a bodyguard, too,\" Amelia said casually, as if everyone\u0027s dad had a bodyguard.\\n\\n They were walking up the gravel sidewalk now, not even looking at its neat border of ilex. Up the wooden steps. Across the front porch. Knocking.\\n\\n I thought of all the scary creatures that had been in my house: Weres, shifters, vampires, even a demon or two. Why should I be worried about this man? I straightened my spine, chilled my anxious brain, and went to the front door, though Amelia almost beat me to it. After all, this was my house.\\n\\n I put my hand on the knob, and I got my smile ready before I opened the door.\\n\\n \"Please come in,\" I said, and Marley opened the screen door for Mr. Carmichael, who came in and hugged his daughter but not before he\u0027d cast another comprehensive look around the living room.\\n\\n He was as clear a broadcaster as his daughter.\\n\\n He was thinking this looked mighty shabby for a daughter of his... Pretty girl Amelia was living with... Wondered if Amelia was having sex with her... The girl was probably no better than she should be... No police record, though she had dated a vampire and had a wild brother...\\n\\n Of course a rich and powerful man like Copley Carmichael would have his daughter\u0027s new housemate investigated. Such a procedure had simply never occurred to me, like so many things the rich did.\\n\\n I took a deep breath. \"I\u0027m Sookie Stackhouse,\" I said politely. \"You must be Mr. Carmichael. And this is?\" After shaking Mr. Carmichael\u0027s hand, I extended mine to Marley.\\n\\n For a second, I thought I\u0027d caught Amelia\u0027s dad off-footed. But he recovered in record time.\\n\\n \"This is Tyrese Marley,\" Mr. Carmichael said smoothly.\\n\\n The chauffeur shook my hand gently, as if he didn\u0027t want to break my bones, and then he nodded to Amelia. \"Miss Amelia,\" he said, and Amelia looked angry, as if she was going to tell him to cut the \"Miss,\" but then she reconsidered. All these thoughts, pinging back and forth... It was enough to keep me distracted.\\n\\n Tyrese Marley was a very, very light-skinned African-American. He was far from black; his skin was more the color of old ivory. His eyes were bright hazel. Though his hair was black, it wasn\u0027t curly, and it had a red cast. Marley was a man you\u0027d always look at twice.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll take the car back to town and get some gas,\" he said to his boss. \"While you spend time with Miss Amelia. When you want me back?\"\\n\\n Mr. Carmichael looked down at his watch. \"A couple of hours.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re welcome to stay for supper,\" I said, managing a very neutral tone. I wanted what made everyone feel comfortable.\\n\\n \"I have a few errands I need to run,\" Tyrese Marley said with no inflection. \"Thanks for the invitation. I\u0027ll see you later.\" He left.\\n\\n Okay, end of my attempt at democracy.\\n\\n Tyrese couldn\u0027t have known how much I would have preferred going into town rather than staying in the house. I braced myself and began the social necessities. \"Can I get you a glass of wine, Mr. Carmichael, or something else to drink? What about you, Amelia?\"\\n\\n \"Call me Cope,\" he said, smiling. It was way too much like a shark\u0027s grin to warm my heart. \"Sure, a glass of whatever\u0027s open. You, baby?\"\\n\\n \"Some of the white,\" she said, and I heard her telling her dad to be seated as I went to the kitchen.\\n\\n I served the wine and added it to the tray with our hors d\u0027oeuvres: crackers, a warm Brie spread, and apricot jam mixed with hot peppers. We had some cute little knives that looked good with the tray, and Amelia had gotten cocktail napkins for the drinks.\\n\\n Cope had a good appetite, and he enjoyed the Brie. He sipped the wine, which was an Arkansas label, and nodded politely. Well, at least he didn\u0027t spit it out. I seldom drink, and I\u0027m no kind of wine connoisseur. In fact, I\u0027m not a connoisseur of anything at all. But I enjoyed the wine, sip by sip.\\n\\n \"Amelia, tell me what you\u0027re doing with your time while you\u0027re waiting for your home to be repaired,\" Cope said, which I thought was a reasonable opening.\\n\\n I started to tell him that for starters, she wasn\u0027t screwing around with me, but I thought that might be a little too direct. I tried very hard not to read his thoughts, but I swear, with him and his daughter in the same room, it was like listening to a television broadcast.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve done some filing for one of the local insurance agents. And I\u0027m working part-time at Merlotte\u0027s Bar,\" Amelia said. \"I serve drinks and the occasional chicken basket.\"\\n\\n \"Is the bar work interesting?\" Cope didn\u0027t sound sarcastic, I\u0027ll give him that. But, of course, I was sure he\u0027d had Sam researched, too.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not bad,\" she said with a slight smile. That was a lot of restraint for Amelia, so I checked into her brain to see that she was squeezing herself into a conversational girdle. \"I get good tips.\"\\n\\n Her father nodded. \"You, Miss Stackhouse?\" Cope asked politely.\\n\\n He knew everything about me but the shade of fingernail polish I was wearing, and I was sure he\u0027d add that to my file if he could. \"I work at Merlotte\u0027s full-time,\" I said, just as if he didn\u0027t know that. \"I\u0027ve been there for years.\"\\n\\n \"You have family in the area?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, yes, we\u0027ve been here forever,\" I said. \"Or as close to forever as Americans get. But our family\u0027s dwindled down. It\u0027s just me and my brother now.\"\\n\\n \"Older brother? Younger?\"\\n\\n \"Older,\" I said. \"Married, real recently.\"\\n\\n \"So maybe there\u0027ll be other little Stackhouses,\" he said, trying to sound like he thought that would be a good thing.\\n\\n I nodded as if the possibility pleased me, too. I didn\u0027t like my brother\u0027s wife much, and I thought it was entirely possible that any kids they had would be pretty rotten. In fact, one was on the way right now, if Crystal didn\u0027t miscarry again. My brother was a werepanther (bitten, not born), and his wife was a born... a pure... werepanther, that is. Being raised in the little werepanther community of Hotshot was not an easy thing, and would be even harder for kids who weren\u0027t pure.\\n\\n \"Dad, can I get you some more wine?\" Amelia was out of her chair like a shot, and she sped on her way to the kitchen with the half-empty wineglass. Good, quality alone time with Amelia\u0027s dad.\\n\\n \"Sookie,\" Cope said, \"you\u0027ve been very kind to let my daughter live with you all this time.\"\\n\\n \"Amelia pays rent,\" I said. \"She buys half the groceries. She pays her way.\"\\n\\n \"Nonetheless, I wish you\u0027d let me give you something for your trouble.\"\\n\\n \"What Amelia gives me on rent is enough. After all, she\u0027s paid for some improvements to the property, too.\"\\n\\n His face sharpened then, as if he was on the scent of something big. Did he think I\u0027d talked Amelia into putting a pool in the backyard?\\n\\n \"She got a window air conditioner put in her bedroom upstairs,\" I said. \"And she got an extra phone line for the computer. And I think she got a throw rug and some curtains for her room, too.\"\\n\\n \"She lives upstairs?\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" I said, surprised he didn\u0027t somehow know already. Perhaps there were a few things his intelligence net hadn\u0027t scooped up. \"I live down here, she lives up there, and we share the kitchen and living room, though I think Amelia\u0027s got a TV upstairs, too. Hey, Amelia!\" I called.\\n\\n \"Yeah?\" Her voice floated down the hall from the kitchen.\\n\\n \"You still got that little TV up there?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, I hooked it up to the cable.\"\\n\\n \"Just wondered.\"\\n\\n I smiled at Cope, indicating the conversational ball was in his court. He was thinking of several things to ask me, and he was thinking of the best way to approach me to get the most information. A name popped to the surface in the whirlpool of his thoughts, and it took everything I had to keep a polite expression.\\n\\n \"The first tenant Amelia had in the house on Chloe - she was your cousin, right?\" Cope said.\\n\\n \"Hadley. Yes.\" I kept my face calm as I nodded. \"Did you know her?\"\\n\\n \"I know her husband,\" he said, and smiled. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/from-dead-to-worse-sookie-stackhouse-8/page-2.html","bookId":2198,"book":{"id":2198,"title":"From Dead to Worse (Sookie Stackhouse #8)","description":"Storyline: From Dead to Worse (Sookie Stackhouse #8) \\n After the natural disaster of Hurricane Katrina and the manmade explosion at the vampire summit, everyone human and otherwise is stressed, including Louisiana cocktail waitress Sookie Stackhouse, who is trying to cope with the fact that her boyfriend Quinn has gone missing. \\n It\u0027s clear that things are changing whether the weres and vamps of her corner of Louisiana like it or not.
