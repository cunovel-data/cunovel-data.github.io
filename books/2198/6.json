{"id":101303,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"There was a knock on the front door the next morning about an hour before I wanted to wake up. I heard it only because Bob had come into my room and jumped on my bed, where he wasn\u0027t supposed to be, settling into the space behind my knees while I lay on my side. He purred loudly, and I reached down to scratch behind his ears. I loved cats. That didn\u0027t stop me from liking dogs, too, and only the fact that I was gone so much kept me from getting a puppy. Terry Bellefleur had offered me one, but I\u0027d wavered until his pups were gone. I wondered if Bob would mind a kitten companion. Would Amelia get jealous if I bought a female cat? I had to smile even as I snuggled deeper into the bed. But I wasn\u0027t truly asleep, and I did hear the knock. I muttered a few words about the person at the door, and I slid on my slippers and threw on my thin blue cotton bathrobe. The morning had a hint of chill, reminding me that despite the mild and sunny days, this was October. There were Halloweens when even a sweater was too warm, and there were Halloweens when you had to wear a light coat when you did your trick-or-treating. I looked through the peephole and saw an elderly black woman with a halo of white hair. She was light-skinned and her features were narrow and sharp: nose, lips, eyes. She was wearing magenta lipstick and a yellow pantsuit. But she didn\u0027t seem armed or dangerous. This just goes to show how misleading first appearances can be. I opened the door. \"Young lady, I\u0027m here to see Amelia Broadway,\" the woman informed me in very precisely pronounced English. \"Please come in,\" I said, because this was an older woman and I\u0027d been brought up to revere old people. \"Have a seat.\" I indicated the couch. \"I\u0027ll go up and get Amelia.\" I noticed she didn\u0027t apologize for getting me out of bed or for showing up unannounced. I climbed the stairs with a grim feeling that Amelia wasn\u0027t going to enjoy this message. I so seldom went up to the second floor that it surprised me to see how nice Amelia had made it look. Since the upper bedrooms had only had basic furniture in them, she\u0027d turned the one to the right, the larger one, into her bedroom. The one to the left was her sitting room. It held her television, an easy chair and ottoman, a small computer desk and her computer, and a plant or two. The bedroom, which I believed had been built for a generation of Stackhouses that had sired three boys in quick succession, had only a small closet, but Amelia had bought rolling clothes racks from somewhere on the Internet and assembled them handily. Then she\u0027d bought a tri-fold screen at an auction and repainted it and arranged it in front of the racks to camouflage them. Her bright bedspread and the old table she\u0027d repainted to serve as her makeup table added to the color that jumped out from the white-painted walls. Amid all this cheer was one dismal witch. Amelia was sitting up in bed, her short hair mashed into strange shapes. \"Who is that I hear downstairs?\" she asked in a very hushed voice. \"Older black lady, light-skinned? Sharp way about her?\" \"Omigod,\" Amelia breathed, and slumped back against her dozen or so pillows. \"It\u0027s Octavia.\" \"Well, you come down and have a word with her. I can\u0027t entertain her.\" Amelia snarled at me, but she accepted the inevitable. She got out of bed and pulled off her nightgown. She pulled on a bra and panties and some jeans, and she extracted a sweater from a drawer. I went down to tell Octavia Fant that Amelia was coming. Amelia would have to walk right past her to get to the bathroom, since there was only the one staircase, but at least I could smooth the way. \"Can I get you some coffee?\" I asked. The older woman was busy looking around the room with her bright brown eyes. \"If you have some tea, I\u0027d like a cup,\" Octavia Fant said. \"Yes, ma\u0027am, we have some,\" I said, relieved that Amelia had insisted on buying it. I had no idea what kind it was, and I hoped it was in a bag, because I\u0027d never made hot tea in my life. \"Good,\" she said, and that was that. \"Amelia\u0027s on her way down,\" I said, trying to think of some graceful way to add, \"And she\u0027s going to have to hurry through the room to pee and brush her teeth, so pretend you don\u0027t see her.\" I abandoned that lost cause and fled to the kitchen. I retrieved Amelia\u0027s tea from one of her designated shelves, and while the water was getting hot, I got down two cups and saucers and put them on a tray. I added the sugar bowl and a tiny pitcher with milk and two spoons. Napkins! I thought, and wished I had some cloth ones instead of regular paper. (This was how Octavia Fant made me feel, without her using a bit of magic on me.) I heard the water running in the hall bathroom just as I put a handful of cookies on a plate and added that to the assemblage. I didn\u0027t have any flowers or a little vase, which was the only other thing I thought of that I could\u0027ve added. I picked up the tray and made my way slowly down the hall to the living room. I set the tray down on the coffee table in front of Ms. Fant. She looked up at me with her piercing eyes and gave me a curt nod of thanks. I realized that I could not read her mind. I\u0027d been holding off, waiting for a moment when I could really give her her proper due, but she knew how to block me out. I\u0027d never met a human who could do that. For a second I felt almost irritated. Then I remembered who and what she was, and I scooted off to my room to make my bed and visit my own little bathroom. I passed Amelia in the hall, and she gave me a scared look. Sorry, Amelia, I thought, as I closed my bedroom door firmly. You\u0027re on your own. I didn\u0027t have to be at work until the evening, so I put on some old jeans and a Fangtasia T-shirt (\"The Bar with a Bite\"). Pam had given it to me when the bar first started selling them. I slid my feet into some Crocs and went into the kitchen to fix my own beverage, coffee. I made some toast and got the local paper I\u0027d grabbed when I\u0027d answered the door. Rolling the rubber band off, I glanced at the front page. The school board had met, the local Wal-Mart had donated generously to the Boys and Girls Club\u0027s after-school program, and the state legislature had voted to recognize vampire-human marriages. Well, well. No one had thought that bill would ever pass. I flipped open the paper to read the obituaries. First the local deaths - no one I knew, good. Then the area deaths - oh, no. MARIA-STAR COOPER, read the heading. The item said only, \"Maria-Star Cooper, 25, a resident of Shreveport, died unexpectedly at her home yesterday. Cooper, a photographer, is survived by her mother and father, Matthew and Stella Cooper of Minden, and three brothers. Arrangements are pending.\" I felt suddenly out of breath and sank into the straight-back chair with a feeling of total disbelief. Maria-Star and I hadn\u0027t exactly been friends, but I\u0027d liked her well enough, and she and Alcide Herveaux, a major figure in the Shreveport Were pack, had been going together for months. Poor Alcide! His first girlfriend had died violently, and now this. The phone rang and I jumped. I grabbed it up with a terrible feeling of disaster. \"Hello?\" I said cautiously, as if the phone could spit at me. \"Sookie,\" said Alcide. He had a deep voice, and now it was husky with tears. \"I\u0027m so sorry,\" I said. \"I just read the paper.\" There was nothing else to say. Now I knew why he\u0027d called the night before. \"She was murdered,\" Alcide said. \"Oh, my God.\" \"Sookie, it was only the beginning. On the off chance that Furnan is after you, too, I want you to stay alert.\" \"Too late,\" I said after a moment given to absorbing this awful news. \"Someone tried to kill me last night.\" Alcide held the phone away from him and howled. Hearing this, in the middle of the day, over the telephone... Even then, it was frightening. Trouble within the Shreveport pack had been brewing for a while. Even I, separated from Were politics, had known that. Patrick Furnan, the leader of the Long Tooth pack, had gotten his office by killing Alcide\u0027s father in combat. The victory had been legal - well, Were legal - but there had been a few not-so-legal plays along the way. Alcide - strong, young, prosperous, and packing a grudge - had always been a threat to Furnan, at least in Furnan\u0027s mind. This was a tense topic, since Weres were secret from the human population, not out in the open like vampires. The day was coming, and coming soon, when the shifter population would step forward. I\u0027d heard them speak of it over and over. But that hadn\u0027t happened yet, and it wouldn\u0027t be good if the first knowledge the humans had of the Weres was of bodies turning up all over the place. \"Someone will be over there right away,\" Alcide said. \"Absolutely not. I have to go to work tonight, and I\u0027m so utterly on the edge of this thing that I\u0027m sure they won\u0027t try again. But I do need to know how the guy knew where and when to find me.\" \"Tell Amanda the circumstances,\" Alcide said, his voice thick with anger, and then Amanda came on. Hard to believe that when I\u0027d seen her at the wedding we\u0027d both been so cheerful. \"Tell me,\" she said crisply, and I knew this was no time to argue. I told her the story as tersely as possible (leaving out Niall, and Eric\u0027s name, and most other details), and she was silent for a few seconds after I\u0027d finished speaking. \"Since he was taken out, that\u0027s one less we have to worry about,\" she said, sounding simply relieved. \"I wish you\u0027d known who he was.\" \"Sorry,\" I said a bit acidly. \"I was thinking about the gun, not his ID. How come you-all can have a war with as few people as you have?\" The Shreveport pack couldn\u0027t number over thirty. \"Reinforcements from other territories.\" \"Why would anyone do that?\" Why join in a war that wasn\u0027t yours? What was the point of losing your own people when it was the other pack\u0027s dispute? \"There are perks to backing the winning side,\" Amanda said. \"Listen, you still got that witch living with you?\" \"I do.\" \"Then there\u0027s something you can do to help.\" \"Okay,\" I said, though I didn\u0027t recall offering. \"What would that be?\" \"You need to ask your witch friend if she\u0027ll go to Maria-Star\u0027s apartment and get some kind of reading on what happened there. Is that possible? We want to know the Weres involved.\" \"It\u0027s possible, but I don\u0027t know if she\u0027ll do it.\" \"Ask her now, please.\" \"Ah... let me call you back. She\u0027s got a visitor.\" Before I went out to the living room, I made a call. I didn\u0027t want to leave this message on the answering machine at Fangtasia, which wouldn\u0027t be open yet, so I called Pam\u0027s cell, something I\u0027d never done before. As it rang, I found myself wondering if it was in the coffin with her. That was an eerie thing to picture. I didn\u0027t know if Pam actually slept in a coffin or not, but if she did... I shuddered. Of course, the phone went to voice mail, and I said, \"Pam, I\u0027ve found out why Eric and I were pulled over last night, or at least I think so. There\u0027s a Were war brewing, and I think I was the target. Someone sold us out to Patrick Furnan. And I didn\u0027t tell anyone where I was going.\" That was a problem Eric and I had been too shaken to discuss the night before. How had anyone, anyone at all, known where we\u0027d be last night? That we\u0027d be driving back from Shreveport. Amelia and Octavia were in the middle of a discussion, but neither of them looked as angry or upset as I\u0027d feared. \"I hate to intrude,\" I said as both pairs of eyes turned to me. Octavia\u0027s eyes were brown, Amelia\u0027s bright blue, but at the moment they were eerily alike in expression. \"Yes?\" Octavia was clearly queen of the situation. Any witch worth her salt would know about Weres. I condensed the issues of the Were war down to a few sentences, told them about the attack the night before on the interstate, and explained Amanda\u0027s request. \"Is this something you should get involved with, Amelia?\" Octavia asked, her voice making it quite clear there was only one answer she should give. \"Oh, I think so,\" Amelia said. She smiled. \"Can\u0027t have someone shooting at my roomie. I\u0027ll help Amanda.\" Octavia couldn\u0027t have been more shocked if Amelia had spat a watermelon seed on her pants. \"Amelia! You\u0027re trying things beyond your ability! This will lead to terrible trouble! Look what you\u0027ve already done to poor Bob Jessup.\" Oh, boy, I hadn\u0027t known Amelia that long, but I already knew that was a poor way to get her to comply with your wishes. If Amelia was proud of anything, it was her witchy ability. Challenging her expertise was a sure way to rattle her. On the other hand, Bob was a major fuckup. \"Can you change him back?\" I asked the older witch. Octavia looked at me sharply. \"Of course,\" she said. \"Then why don\u0027t you do it, and we can go from there?\" I said. Octavia looked very startled, and I knew I shouldn\u0027t have gotten up in her face like that. On the other hand, if she wanted to show Amelia that her magic was more powerful, here was her chance. Bob the cat was sitting in Amelia\u0027s lap, looking unconcerned. Octavia reached in her pocket and pulled out a pill container filled with what looked like marijuana; but I guess any dried herb pretty much looks the same, and I haven\u0027t ever actually handled marijuana, so I\u0027m no judge. Anyway, Octavia took a pinch of this dried green stuff and reached out to let the bits drop on the cat\u0027s fur. Bob didn\u0027t seem to mind. Amelia\u0027s face was a picture as she watched Octavia casting a spell, which seemed to consist of some Latin, a few motions, and the aforementioned herb. Finally, Octavia uttered what must have been the esoteric equivalent of \"Allakazam!\" and pointed at the cat. Nothing happened. Octavia repeated the phrase even more forcefully. Again with the finger pointing. And again with the no results. \"You know what I think?\" I said. No one seemed to want to know, but it was my house. \"I wonder if Bob was always a cat, and for some reason he was temporarily human. That\u0027s why you can\u0027t change him back. Maybe he\u0027s in his true form right now.\" \"That\u0027s ridiculous,\" the older witch snapped. She was some kind of put out at her failure. Amelia was trying hard to suppress a grin. \"If you\u0027re so sure after this that Amelia\u0027s incompetent, which I happen to know she isn\u0027t, you might want to consider coming to see Maria-Star\u0027s apartment with us,\" I said. \"Make sure Amelia doesn\u0027t get into any trouble.\" Amelia looked indignant for a second, but she seemed to see my plan, and she added her entreaty to mine. \"Very well. I\u0027ll come along,\" Octavia said grandly. I couldn\u0027t see into the old witch\u0027s mind, but I\u0027d worked at a bar long enough to know a lonely person when I saw one. I got the address from Amanda, who told me Dawson was guarding the place until we arrived. I knew him and liked him, since he\u0027d helped me out before. He owned a local motorcycle repair shop a couple of miles out of Bon Temps, and he sometimes ran Merlotte\u0027s for Sam. Dawson didn\u0027t run with a pack, and the news that he was pitching in with Alcide\u0027s rebel faction was significant. I can\u0027t say the drive to the outskirts of Shreveport was a bonding experience for the three of us, but I did fill Octavia in on the background of the pack troubles. And I explained my own involvement. \"When the contest for packmaster was taking place,\" I said, \"Alcide wanted me there as a human lie detector. I actually did catch the other guy cheating, which was good. But after that, it became a fight to the death, and Patrick Furnan was stronger. He killed Jackson Herveaux.\" \"I guess they covered up the death?\" The old witch seemed neither shocked nor surprised. \"Yes, they put the body out at an isolated farm he owned, knowing no one would look there for a while. The wounds on the body weren\u0027t recognizable by the time he was found.\" \"Has Patrick Furnan been a good leader?\" \"I really don\u0027t know,\" I admitted. \"Alcide has always seemed to have a discontented group around him, and they\u0027re the ones I know best in the pack, so I guess I\u0027m on Alcide\u0027s side.\" \"Did you ever consider that you could just step aside? Let the best Were win?\" \"No,\" I said honestly. \"I would have been just as glad if Alcide hadn\u0027t called me and told me about the pack troubles. But now that I know, I\u0027ll help him if I can. Not that I\u0027m an angel or anything. But Patrick Furnan hates me, and it\u0027s only smart to help his enemy, point number one. And I liked Maria-Star, point number two. And someone tried to kill me last night, someone who may have been hired by Furnan, point number three.\" Octavia nodded. She was sure no wussy old lady. Maria-Star had lived in a rather dated apartment building on Highway 3 between Benton and Shreveport. It was a small complex, just two buildings side by side facing a parking lot, right there on the highway. The buildings backed onto a field, and the adjacent businesses were day businesses: an insurance agency and a dentist\u0027s office. Each of the two red brick buildings was divided into four apartments. I noticed a familiar battered pickup truck in front of the building on the right, and I parked by it. These apartments were enclosed; you went in the common entrance into a hall, and there was a door on either side of the stairway to the second floor. Maria-Star had lived on the ground-floor left apartment. This was easy to spot, because Dawson was propped against the wall beside her door. I introduced him to the two witches as \"Dawson\" because I didn\u0027t know his first name. Dawson was a supersized man. I\u0027d bet you could crack pecans on his biceps. He had dark brown hair beginning to show just a little gray, and a neatly trimmed mustache. I\u0027d known who he was all my life, but I\u0027d never known him well. Dawson was probably seven or eight years older than me, and he\u0027d married early. And divorced early, too. His son, who lived with the mother, was quite a football player for Clarice High School. Dawson looked tougher than any guy I\u0027d ever met. I don\u0027t know if it was the very dark eyes, or the grim face, or simply the size of him. There was crime scene tape across the apartment doorway. My eyes welled up when I saw it. Maria-Star had died violently in this space only hours before. Dawson produced a set of keys (Alcide\u0027s?) and unlocked the door, and we ducked under the tape to enter. And we all stood frozen in silence, appalled at the state of the little living room. My way was blocked by an overturned occasional table with a big gash marring the wood. My eyes flickered over the irregular dark stains on the walls until my brain told me the stains were blood. The smell was faint but unpleasant. I began to breathe shallowly so I wouldn\u0027t get sick. \"Now, what do you want us to do?\" Octavia asked. \"I thought you\u0027d do an ectoplasmic reconstruction, like Amelia did before,\" I said. \"Amelia did an ectoplasmic reconstruction?\" Octavia had dropped the haughty tone and sounded genuinely surprised and admiring. \"I\u0027ve never seen one.\" Amelia nodded modestly. \"With Terry and Bob and Patsy,\" she said. \"It worked great. We had a big area to cover.\" \"Then I\u0027m sure we can do one here,\" Octavia said. She looked interested and excited. It was like her face had woken up. I realized that what I\u0027d seen before had been her depressed face. And I was getting enough from her head (now that she wasn\u0027t concentrating on keeping me out) to let me know that Octavia had spent a month after Katrina wondering where her next meal would come from, where she\u0027d lay her head from night to night. Now she lived with family, though I didn\u0027t get a clean picture. \"I brought the stuff with me,\" Amelia said. Her brain was radiating pride and relief. She might yet get out from under the Bob contretemps without paying a huge price. Dawson stood leaning against the wall, listening with apparent interest. Since he was a Were, it was hard to read his thoughts, but he was definitely relaxed. I envied him. It wasn\u0027t possible for me to be at ease in this terrible little apartment, which almost echoed with the violence done in its walls. I was scared to sit on the love seat or the armchair, both upholstered in blue and white checks. The carpet was a darker blue, and the paint was white. Everything matched. The apartment was a little dull for my taste. But it had been neat and clean and carefully arranged, and less than twenty-four hours ago it had been a home. I could see through to the bedroom, where the covers were thrown back. This was the only sign of disorder in the bedroom or the kitchen. The living room had been the center of the violence. For lack of a better place to park myself, I went to lean against the bare wall beside Dawson. I didn\u0027t think the motorcycle repairman and I had ever had a long conversation, though he\u0027d gotten shot in my defense a few months before. I\u0027d heard that the law (in this case, Andy Bellefleur and his fellow detective Alcee Beck) suspected more took place at Dawson\u0027s shop than motorcycle repairs, but they\u0027d never caught Dawson doing anything illegal. Dawson also hired out as a bodyguard from time to time, or maybe he volunteered his services. He was certainly suited to the job. \"Were you friends?\" Dawson rumbled, nodding his head at the bloodiest spot on the floor, the spot where Maria-Star had died. \"We were more like friendly acquaintances,\" I said, not wanting to claim more grief than my due. \"I saw her at a wedding a couple of nights ago.\" I started to say she\u0027d been fine then, but that would have been stupid. You don\u0027t sicken before you\u0027re murdered. \"When was the last time anyone talked to Maria-Star?\" Amelia asked Dawson. \"I need to establish some time limits.\" \"Eleven last night,\" he said. \"Phone call from Alcide. He was out of town, with witnesses. Neighbor heard a big to-do from in here about thirty minutes after that, called the police.\" That was a long speech for Dawson. Amelia went back to her preparations, and Octavia read a thin book that Amelia had extracted from her little backpack. \"Have you ever watched one of these before?\" Dawson said to me. \"Yeah, in New Orleans. I gather this is kind of rare and hard to do. Amelia\u0027s really good.\" \"She\u0027s livin\u0027 with you?\" I nodded. \"That\u0027s what I heard,\" he said. We were quiet for a moment. Dawson was proving to be a restful companion as well as a handy hunk of muscle. There was some gesturing, and there was some chanting, with Octavia following her onetime student. Octavia might never have done an ectoplasmic reconstruction, but the longer the ritual went on the more power reverberated in the small room, until my fingernails seemed to hum with it. Dawson didn\u0027t exactly look frightened, but he was definitely on the alert as the pressure of the magic built. He uncrossed his arms and stood up straight, and I did, too. Though I knew what to expect, it was still startling to me when Maria-Star appeared in the room with us. Beside me, I felt Dawson jerk with surprise. Maria-Star was painting her toenails. Her long dark hair was gathered into a ponytail on top of her head. She was sitting on the carpet in front of the television, a sheet of newspaper spread carefully under her foot. The magically re-created image had the same watery look I\u0027d seen in a previous reconstruction, when I\u0027d observed my cousin Hadley during her last few hours on earth. Maria-Star wasn\u0027t exactly in color. She was like an image filled with glistening gel. Because the apartment was no longer in the same order it had been when she\u0027d sat in that spot, the effect was odd. She was sitting right in the middle of the overturned coffee table. We didn\u0027t have long to wait. Maria-Star finished her toenails and sat watching the television set (now dark and dead) while she waited for them to dry. She did a few leg exercises while she waited. Then she gathered up the polish and the little spacers she\u0027d had between her toes and folded the paper. She rose and went into the bathroom. Since the actual bathroom door was now half-closed, the watery Maria-Star had to walk through it. From our angle, Dawson and I couldn\u0027t see inside, but Amelia, whose hands were extended in a kind of sustaining gesture, gave a little shrug as if to say Maria-Star was not doing anything important. Ectoplasmic peeing, maybe. In a few minutes, the young woman appeared again, this time in her nightgown. She went into the bedroom and turned back the bed. Suddenly, her head turned toward the door. It was like watching a pantomime. Clearly Maria-Star had heard a sound at her door, and the sound was unexpected. I didn\u0027t know if she was hearing the doorbell, a knocking, or someone trying to pick the lock. Her alert posture turned to alarm, even panic. She went back into the living room and picked up her cell phone - we saw it appear when she touched it - and punched a couple of numbers. Calling someone on speed dial. But before the phone could even have rung on the other end, the door exploded inward and a man was on her, a half wolf, half man. He showed up because he was a living thing, but he was clearer when he was close to Maria-Star, the focus of the spell. He pinned Maria-Star to the floor and bit her deeply on her shoulder. Her mouth opened wide, and you could tell she was screaming and she was fighting like a Were, but he\u0027d caught her totally by surprise and her arms were pinned down. Gleaming lines indicated blood running down from the bite. Dawson gripped my shoulder, a growl rising from his throat. I didn\u0027t know if he was furious at the attack on Maria-Star, excited by the action and the impression of flowing blood, or all of the above. A second Were was right behind the first. He was in his human form. He had a knife in his right hand. He plunged it into Maria-Star\u0027s torso, withdrew it, reared back, and plunged it in again. As the knife rose and fell, it cast blood drops on the walls. We could see the blood drops, so there must be ectoplasm (or whatever it really is) in blood, too. I hadn\u0027t known the first man. This guy, I recognized. He was Cal Myers, a henchman of Furnan\u0027s and a police detective on the Shreveport force. The blitz attack had taken only seconds. The moment Maria-Star was clearly mortally wounded, they were out the door, closing it behind them. I was shocked by the sudden and dreadful cruelty of the murder, and I felt my breath coming faster. Maria-Star, glistening and almost clear, lay there before us for a moment in the middle of the wreckage, gleaming blood splotches on her shirt and on the floor around her, and then she just winked out of existence, because she had died in that moment. We all stood in appalled silence. The witches were silent, their arms dropping down by their sides as if they were puppets whose strings had been cut. Octavia was crying, tears running down her creased cheeks. Amelia looked as though she were thinking of throwing up. I was shivering in reaction, and even Dawson looked nauseated. \"I didn\u0027t know the first guy since he\u0027d only half changed,\" Dawson said. \"The second one looked familiar. He\u0027s a cop, right? In Shreveport?\" \"Cal Myers. Better call Alcide,\" I said when I thought my voice would work. \"And Alcide needs to send these ladies something for their trouble, when he gets his own sorted out.\" I figured Alcide might not think of that since he was mourning for Maria-Star, but the witches had done this work with no mention of recompense. They deserved to be rewarded for their effort. It had cost them dearly: both of them had folded onto the love seat. \"If you ladies can manage,\" Dawson said, \"we better get our asses out of here. No telling when the police\u0027ll be back. The crime lab finished just five minutes before you got here.\" While the witches gathered their energy and all their paraphernalia, I talked to Dawson. \"You said Alcide\u0027s got a good alibi?\" Dawson nodded. \"He got a phone call from Maria-Star\u0027s neighbor. She called Alcide right after she called the police, when she heard all the ruckus. Granted, the call was to his cell phone, but he answered right away and she could hear the sounds of the hotel bar behind the conversation. Plus, he was in the bar with people he\u0027d just met who swore he was there when he found out she\u0027d been killed. They aren\u0027t likely to forget.\" \"I guess the police are trying to find a motive.\" That was what they did on the TV shows. \"She didn\u0027t have enemies,\" Dawson said. \"Now what?\" Amelia said. She and Octavia were on their feet, but they were clearly drained. Dawson shepherded us out of the apartment and relocked it. \"Thanks for coming, ladies,\" Dawson told Amelia and Octavia. He turned to me. \"Sookie, could you come with me, explain to Alcide what we just saw? Can Amelia drive Miss Fant back?\" \"Ah. Sure. If she\u0027s not too tired.\" Amelia said she thought she could manage. We\u0027d come in my car, so I tossed her the keys. \"You okay driving?\" I asked, just to reassure myself. She nodded. \"I\u0027ll take it slow.\" I was scrambling into Dawson\u0027s truck when I realized that this step dragged me even further into the Were war. Then I figured, Patrick Furnan already tried to kill me.
