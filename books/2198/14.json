{"id":101311,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"While I was getting ready for work - yes, even after a night like the one I\u0027d had, I had to go to work - there was a knock at the front door. I\u0027d heard something big coming down the driveway, so I\u0027d tied my shoes hastily. The FedEx truck was not a frequent visitor at my house, and the thin woman who hopped out was a stranger. I opened the battered front door with some difficulty. It was never going to be the same after Quinn\u0027s entrance the night before. I made a mental note to call the Lowe\u0027s in Clarice to ask about a replacement. Maybe Jason would help me hang it. The FedEx lady gave a long look at the door\u0027s splintered condition when I finally got it open. \"You want to sign for this?\" she said as she held out a package, tactfully not commenting. \"Sure.\" I accepted the box, a little puzzled. It had come from Fangtasia. Huh. As soon as the truck had wheeled back out to Hummingbird Road, I opened the package. It was a red cell phone. It was programmed to my number. There was a note with it. \"Sorry about the other one, lover,\" it read. Signed with a big \"E.\" There was a charger included. And a car charger, too. And a notice that my first six months\u0027 bill had been paid. With a kind of bemused feeling, I heard another truck coming. I didn\u0027t even bother to move from the front porch. The new arrival was from the Shreveport Home Depot. It was a new front door, very pretty, with a two-man crew to install it. All charges had been taken care of. I wondered if Eric would clean out my dryer vent. I got to Merlotte\u0027s early so I could have a talk with Sam. But his office door was shut, and I could hear voices inside. Though not unheard of, the closed door was rare. I was instantly concerned and curious. I could read Sam\u0027s familiar mental signature, and there was another one that I had encountered before. I heard a scrape of chair legs inside, and I hastily stepped into the storeroom before the door opened. Tanya Grissom walked by. I waited for a couple of beats, then decided my business was so urgent I had to risk a conversation with Sam, though he might not be in the mood for it. My boss was still in his creaky wooden rolling chair, his feet propped on the desk. His hair was even more of a mess than usual. He looked like he had a reddish halo. He also looked thoughtful and preoccupied, but when I said I needed to tell him some things, he nodded and asked me to shut the door. \"Do you know what happened last night?\" I asked. \"I hear there was a hostile takeover,\" Sam said. He tilted back on the springs of his rolling chair, and they squeaked in an irritating way. I was definitely balancing on a thin edge today, so I had to bite my lip to keep from snapping at him. \"Yeah, you might say that.\" A hostile takeover was pretty much a perfect way to put it. I told him what had happened at my house. Sam looked troubled. \"I don\u0027t ever interfere in vamp business,\" he said. \"The two-natured and vamps don\u0027t mix well. I\u0027m really sorry you got pulled into that, Sookie. That asshole Eric.\" He looked like there was more he wanted to say, but he pressed his lips together. \"Do you know anything about the King of Nevada?\" I asked. \"I know he has a publishing empire,\" Sam said promptly. \"And he has at least one casino and some restaurants. He\u0027s also the ultimate owner of a management company that handles vampire entertainers. You know, the Elvis Undead Revue with all-vamp Elvis tribute artists, which is pretty funny when you think about it, and some great dance groups.\" We both knew that the real Elvis was still around but rarely in any shape to perform. \"If there had to be a takeover of a tourist state, Felipe de Castro is the right vampire for the job. He\u0027ll make sure New Orleans gets rebuilt like it ought to be, because he\u0027ll want the revenue.\" \"Felipe de Castro... That sounds exotic,\" I said. \"I haven\u0027t met him, but I understand he\u0027s very, ah, charismatic,\" Sam said. \"I wonder if he\u0027ll be coming to Louisiana to live or if this Victor Madden will be his agent here. Either way, it won\u0027t affect the bar. But there\u0027s no doubt it\u0027ll affect you, Sookie.\" Sam uncrossed his legs and sat up straight in his chair, which shrieked in protest. \"I wish there was some way to get you out of the vampire loop.\" \"The night I met Bill, if I\u0027d known what I know now, I wonder if I\u0027d have done anything different,\" I said. \"Maybe I would\u0027ve let the Rattrays have him.\" I\u0027d rescued Bill from a sleazy couple who turned out to be not only sleazy, but murderers. They were vampire drainers, people who lured vampires to spots where the vamps could be subdued with silver chains and drained of blood, which sold for big bucks on the black market. Drainers lived hazardous lives. The Rattrays had paid the full price. \"You don\u0027t mean that,\" Sam said. He rocked in the chair again (squeak! squeak!) and rose to his feet. \"You would never do that.\" It felt really pleasant to hear something nice about myself, especially after the morning\u0027s conversation with Quinn. I was tempted to talk to Sam about that, too, but he was edging toward the door. Time to go to work, for both of us. I got up, too. We went out and began the usual motions. My mind was hardly on it, though. To revive my flagging spirits, I tried to think of some bright point in the future, something to look forward to. I couldn\u0027t come up with anything. For a long, bleak moment I stood by the bar, my hand on my order pad, trying not to step over the edge into the chasm of depression. Then I slapped myself on the cheek. Idiot! I have a house, and friends, and a job. I\u0027m luckier than millions of people on the planet. Things will look up. For a while, that worked. I smiled at everyone, and if that smile was brittle, by God, it was still a smile. After an hour or two, Jason came into the bar with his wife, Crystal. Crystal was looking sullen and slightly pregnant, and Jason was looking... Well, he had that hard look about him, the mean look he got sometimes when he\u0027d been disappointed. \"What\u0027s up?\" I asked. \"Oh, not much,\" Jason said expansively. \"You bring us a couple beers?\" \"Sure,\" I said, thinking he\u0027d never ordered for Crystal before. Crystal was a pretty woman several years younger than Jason. She was a werepanther, but she wasn\u0027t a very good one, mostly because of all the inbreeding in the Hotshot community. Crystal had a hard time changing if it wasn\u0027t the full moon, and she had miscarried at least twice that I knew of. I pitied her losses, the more so because I knew the panther community considered her weak. Now Crystal was pregnant a third time. That pregnancy had maybe been the only reason Calvin had let her marry Jason, who was bitten, not born. That is, he\u0027d become a panther by being repeatedly bitten - by a jealous male who wanted Crystal for himself. Jason couldn\u0027t change into a real panther but into a sort of half-beast, half-man version. He enjoyed it. I brought them their beers along with two frosted mugs and waited to see if they were going to place a food order. I wondered about Crystal drinking, but decided it wasn\u0027t my business. \"I\u0027d like me a cheeseburger with fries,\" Jason said. No surprise there. \"What about you, Crystal?\" I asked, trying to sound friendly. After all, this was my sister-in-law. \"Oh, I don\u0027t have enough money to eat,\" she said. I had no idea what to say. I looked at Jason inquiringly, and he gave me a shrug. This shrug said (to his sister), \"I\u0027ve done something stupid and wrong but I\u0027m not going to back down, because I\u0027m a stubborn shit.\" \"Crystal, I\u0027ll be glad to stand you lunch,\" I said very quietly. \"What would you like?\" She glared at her husband. \"I\u0027d like the same, Sookie.\" I wrote her order down on a separate slip and strode to the hatch to turn them in. I had been ready to get angry, and Jason had lit a match and thrown it on my temper. The whole story was clear in their heads, and as I came to understand what was going on, I was sick of both of them. Crystal and Jason had settled into Jason\u0027s house, but almost every day Crystal rode out to Hotshot, her comfort zone, where she didn\u0027t have to pretend anything. She was used to being surrounded by her kin, and she especially missed her sister and her sister\u0027s babies. Tanya Grissom was renting a room from Crystal\u0027s sister, the room Crystal had lived in until she married Jason. Crystal and Tanya had become instant buddies. Since Tanya\u0027s favorite occupation was shopping, Crystal had gone along for the ride several times. In fact, she\u0027d spent all the money Jason had given her for household expenses. She\u0027d done this two pay-checks in a row, despite multiple scenes and promises. Now Jason refused to give her any more money. He was doing all the grocery shopping and picking up any dry cleaning, paying every bill himself. He\u0027d told Crystal if she wanted any money of her own, she had to get a job. The unskilled and pregnant Crystal had not succeeded in finding one, so she didn\u0027t have a dime. Jason was trying to make a point, but by humiliating his wife in public he was making the wrong point entirely. What an idiot my brother could be. What I could do about this situation? Well... nothing. They had to work it out themselves. I was looking at two stunted people who\u0027d never grown up, and I wasn\u0027t optimistic about their chances. With a deep twinge of unease, I remembered their unusual wedding vows; at least, they\u0027d seemed odd to me, though I supposed they were the Hotshot norm. As Jason\u0027s closest living relative, I\u0027d had to promise to take the punishment if Jason misbehaved, just as her uncle Calvin had promised the same on Crystal\u0027s behalf. I\u0027d been pretty damn rash to make that promise. When I carried their plates to their table, I saw that the two were in the jaw-clenching, looking-anywhere-but-at-each-other stage of quarreling. I put the plates down carefully, got them a bottle of Heinz ketchup, and skedaddled. I\u0027d interfered enough by buying Crystal lunch. There was a person involved in this I could approach, and I promised myself then and there that I would. All my anger and unhappiness focused on Tanya Grissom. I really wanted to do something awful to that woman. What the hell was she hanging around for, sniffing around Sam? What was her goal in drawing Crystal into this spending spiral? (And I didn\u0027t think for a second it was by chance that Tanya\u0027s newest big buddy was my sister-in-law.) Was Tanya trying to irritate me to death? It was like having a horsefly buzzing around and lighting occasionally... but never quite close enough to swat. While I went about my job on autopilot, I pondered what I could do to get her out of my orbit. For the first time in my life, I wondered if I could forcibly pin another person down to read her mind. It wouldn\u0027t be so easy, since Tanya was a wereanimal, but I would find out what was driving her. And I had the conviction that information would save me a lot of heartache... a lot. While I plotted and schemed and fumed, Crystal and Jason silently ate their food, and Jason pointedly paid his own bill, while I took care of Crystal\u0027s. They left, and I wondered what their evening would be like. I was glad I wasn\u0027t going to be a party to it. From behind the bar Sam had observed all this, and he asked me in a low voice, \"What\u0027s up with those two?\" \"They\u0027re having the newlywed blues,\" I said. \"Severe adjustment problems.\" He looked troubled. \"Don\u0027t let them drag you into it,\" he said, and then looked like he regretted opening his mouth. \"Sorry, don\u0027t mean to give you unwanted advice,\" he said. Something prickled at the corners of my eyes. Sam was giving me advice because he cared about me. In my overwrought state, that was cause for sentimental tears. \"That\u0027s okay, boss,\" I said, trying to sound perky and carefree. I spun on my heel and went to patrol my tables. Sheriff Bud Dearborn was sitting in my section, which was unusual. Normally he\u0027d pick a seat somewhere else if he knew I was working. Bud had a basket of onion rings in front of him, liberally doused with ketchup, and he was reading a Shreveport paper. The lead story was POLICE SEARCH FOR SIX, and I stopped to ask Bud if I could have his paper when he was through with it. He looked at me suspiciously. His little eyes in his mashed-in face scanned me as if he suspected he\u0027d find a bloody cleaver hanging from my belt. \"Sure, Sookie,\" he said after a long moment. \"You got any of these missing people stowed away at your house?\" I beamed at him, anxiety transforming my smile into the bright grin of someone who wasn\u0027t all there mentally. \"No, Bud, I just want to find out what\u0027s going on in the world. I\u0027m behind on the news.\" Bud said, \"I\u0027ll leave it on the table,\" and he began reading again. I think he would have pinned Jimmy Hoffa on me if he could have figured a way to make it stick. Not that he necessarily thought I was a murderer, but he thought I was fishy and maybe involved in things that he didn\u0027t want happening in his parish. Bud Dearborn and Alcee Beck had that conviction in common, especially since the death of the man in the library. Luckily for me, the man had turned out to have a record as long as my arm; and not only a record, but one for violent crimes. Though Alcee knew I\u0027d acted in self-defense, he\u0027d never trust me... and neither would Bud Dearborn. When Bud had finished his beer and his onion rings and departed to rain terror on the evildoers of Renard Parish, I took his paper over to the bar and read the story with Sam looking over my shoulder. I had deliberately stayed away from the news after the bloodbath at the empty office park. I\u0027d been sure the Were community couldn\u0027t cover up something so big; all they could do was muddy the trail the police would surely be following. That proved to be the case. After more than twenty-four hours, police remain baffled in their search for six missing Shreveport citizens. Hampering them is their inability to discover anyone who saw any of the missing people after ten o\u0027clock on Wednesday night. \"We can\u0027t find anything they had in common,\" said Detective Willie Cromwell. Among the missing is a Shreveport police detective, Cal Myers; Amanda Whatley, owner of a bar in the central Shreveport area; Patrick Furnan, owner of the local Harley-Davidson dealership, and his wife, Libby; Christine Larrabee, widow of John Larrabee, retired school superintendent; and Julio Martinez, an airman from Barksdale Air Force Base. Neighbors of the Furnans say they hadn\u0027t seen Libby Furnan for a day prior to Patrick Furnan\u0027s disappearance, and Christine Larrabee\u0027s cousin says she had not been able to contact Larrabee by phone for three days, so police speculate that the two women may have met with foul play prior to the disappearance of the others. The disappearance of Detective Cal Myers has the force on edge. His partner, Detective Mike Loughlin, said, \"Myers was one of the newly promoted detectives, and we hadn\u0027t had time to get to know each other well. I have no idea what could have happened to him.\" Myers, 29, had been with the Shreveport force for seven years. He was not married. \"If they are all dead, you would think at least one body would have turned up by now,\" Detective Cromwell said yesterday. \"We have searched all their residences and businesses for clues, and so far we have come up with nothing.\" To add to the mystery, on Monday another Shreveport area resident was murdered. Maria-Star Cooper, photographer\u0027s assistant, was slain in her apartment on Highway 3. \"The apartment was like a butcher shop,\" said Cooper\u0027s landlord, among the first on the scene. No suspects have been reported in the slaying. \"Everyone loved Maria-Star,\" said her mother, Anita Cooper. \"She was so talented and pretty.\" Police do not yet know if Cooper\u0027s death is related to the disappearances. In other news, Don Dominica, owner of Don\u0027s RV Park, reported the absence of the owners of three RVs parked on his property for a week. \"I\u0027m not sure how many people were in each trailer,\" he said. \"They all arrived together and rented the spaces for a month. The name on the rental is Priscilla Hebert. I think at least six people were in each RV. They all seemed pretty normal to me.\" Asked if all their belongings were still in place, Dominica replied, \"I don\u0027t know; I haven\u0027t been checking. I ain\u0027t got time for that. But I haven\u0027t seen hide nor hair of them for days.\" Other residents of the RV park had not met the new-comers. \"They kept to themselves,\" said a neighbor. Police Chief Parfit Graham said, \"I\u0027m sure we\u0027ll solve these crimes. The right piece of information will surface. In the meantime, if anyone has knowledge of the whereabouts of any of these people, call the Tipster Hotline.\" I considered it. I imagined the phone call. \"All of these people died as a result of the werewolf war,\" I would say. \"They were all Weres, and a displaced and hungry pack from south Louisiana decided the dissension in the ranks in Shreveport created an opening for them.\" I didn\u0027t think I\u0027d get much of a hearing. \"So they haven\u0027t found the site yet,\" Sam said very quietly. \"I guess that really was a good place for the meeting.\" \"Sooner or later, though...\" \"Yeah. I wonder what\u0027s left?\" \"Alcide\u0027s crew\u0027s had plenty of time now,\" Sam said. \"So, not much. They probably burned the bodies somewhere out in the sticks. Or buried them on someone\u0027s land.\" I shuddered. Thank God I hadn\u0027t had to be part of that; and at least I really didn\u0027t know where the bodies were buried. After checking my tables and serving some more drinks, I went back to the paper and flipped it open to the obituaries. Reading down the column headed \"State Deaths,\" I got an awful shock. SOPHIE-ANNE LECLERQ, prominent businesswoman, residing in Baton Rouge since Katrina, died of Sino-AIDS in her home. Leclerq, a vampire, had extensive holdings in New Orleans and in many places in the state. Sources close to Leclerq say she had lived in Louisiana for a hundred years or more. I\u0027d never seen an obituary for a vampire. This one was a complete fabrication. Sophie-Anne had not had Sino-AIDS, the only disease that could cross from humans to vampires. Sophie-Anne had probably had an acute attack of Mr. Stake. Sino-AIDS was dreaded among vampires, of course, despite the fact that it was hard to communicate. At least it provided a palatable explanation for the human business community as to why Sophie-Anne\u0027s holdings were being managed by another vampire, and it was an explanation that no one would question too closely, especially since there was no body to refute the claim. To get it in today\u0027s paper, someone must have called it in directly after she\u0027d been killed, perhaps even before she was dead. Ugh. I shivered. I wondered what had really happened to Sigebert, Sophie-Anne\u0027s devoted bodyguard. Victor had implied Sigebert had perished along with the queen, but he hadn\u0027t definitely said so. I couldn\u0027t believe the bodyguard could still be alive. He would never have let anyone get close enough to kill Sophie-Anne. Sigebert had been at her side for so many years, hundreds upon hundreds, that I didn\u0027t think he could have survived her loss. I left the newspaper open to the obituaries and placed it on Sam\u0027s desk, figuring the bar was too busy a place to talk about it even if we had the time. We\u0027d had an influx of customers. I was running my feet off serving them and pocketing some good tips, too. But after the week I\u0027d had, it was not only hard to feel normally happy about the money, it was also impossible to feel normally cheerful about being at work. I just did my best to smile and respond when I was spoken to. By the time I got off work, I didn\u0027t want to talk to anyone about anything. But of course, I didn\u0027t get my druthers. There were two women waiting in the front yard at my house, and they both radiated anger. One, I already knew: Frannie Quinn. The woman with her had to be Quinn\u0027s mother. In the harsh glare of the security light I had a good look at the woman whose life had been such a disaster. I realized no one had ever told me her name. She was still pretty, but in a Goth sort of way that wasn\u0027t kind to her age. She was in her forties; her face was gaunt, her eyes shadowed. She had dark hair with more than a touch of gray, and she was very tall and thin. Frannie was wearing a tank top that showed her bra, and tight jeans, and boots. Her mother was wearing pretty much the same outfit but in different colors. I guessed Frannie had charge of dressing her mother. I parked beside them, because I had no intention of inviting them in. I got out of my car reluctantly. \"You bitch,\" Frannie said passionately. Her young face was rigid with anger. \"How could you do that to my brother? He did so much for you!\" That was one way to look at it. \"Frannie,\" I said, keeping my voice as calm and level as I could, \"what happens between Quinn and me is really not any of your business.\" The front door opened, and Amelia stepped out on the porch. \"Sookie, you need me?\" she asked, and I smelled magic around her. \"I\u0027m coming in, in just a second,\" I said clearly, but didn\u0027t tell her to go back inside. Mrs. Quinn was a pureblood weretiger, and Frannie was half; they were both stronger than me. Mrs. Quinn stepped forward and looked at me quizzically. \"You\u0027re the one John loved,\" she said. \"You\u0027re the one who broke up with him.\" \"Yes, ma\u0027am. It just wasn\u0027t going to work out.\" \"They say I have to go back to that place in the desert,\" she said. \"Where they store all the crazy Weres.\" No shit. \"Oh, do they?\" I said, to make it clear I had nothing to do with it. \"Yes,\" she said, and lapsed into silence, which was kind of a big relief. Frannie, however, had not done with me. \"I loaned you my car,\" she said. \"I came to warn you.\" \"And I thank you,\" I said. My heart sank. I couldn\u0027t think of any magic words to lessen the pain in the air. \"Believe me, I wish things had worked out different.\" Lame but true. \"What\u0027s wrong with my brother?\" Frannie asked. \"He\u0027s handsome; he loves you; he\u0027s got money. He\u0027s a great guy. What\u0027s wrong with you that you don\u0027t want him?\" The bald answer - that I really admired Quinn but didn\u0027t want to play second fiddle to his family\u0027s needs - was simply unspeakable for two reasons: it was unnecessarily hurtful, and I might be seriously injured as a result. Mrs. Quinn might not be compos mentis, but she was listening with growing agitation. If she changed to her tiger form, I had no idea what would happen. She might run off into the woods, or she might attack. All this zoomed through my mind in little pictures. I had to say something. \"Frannie,\" I said very slowly and deliberately because I had no idea what I was going to follow that up with. \"There\u0027s nothing wrong with your brother at all. I think he\u0027s the greatest. But we just have too many strikes against us as a couple. I want him to have the best chance at making a match with some lucky, lucky woman. So I cut him loose. Believe me, I\u0027m hurting, too.\" This was mostly true, which helped. But I hoped Amelia had her fingertips primed to deliver some good magic. And I hoped she got the spell right. Just in case, I began shifting away from Frannie and her mother. Frannie was teetering on the brink of action, and her mother was looking increasingly restless. Amelia had eased forward to the edge of the porch. The smell of magic intensified. For a long moment, the night seemed to catch its breath. And then Frannie turned away. \"Come on, Mama,\" she said, and the two women got into Frannie\u0027s car. I took advantage of the moment to run up on the porch. Amelia and I stood shoulder to shoulder wordlessly until Frannie started up the car and drove away. \"Well,\" Amelia said. \"So, you broke up with him, I\u0027m gathering.\" \"Yeah.\" I was exhausted. \"He had too much baggage.\" Then I winced. \"Gosh, I never thought I\u0027d catch myself saying that. Especially considering my own.\" \"He had his mama.\" Amelia was on a perceptive roll that night. \"Yeah, he had his mama. Listen, thanks for coming out of the house and risking a mauling.\" \"What are roommates for?\" Amelia gave me a light hug and said, \"You look like you need to have a bowl of soup and go to bed.\" \"Yeah,\" I said. \"That sounds about right.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/from-dead-to-worse-sookie-stackhouse-8/page-14.html","bookId":2198,"book":{"id":2198,"title":"From Dead to Worse (Sookie Stackhouse #8)","description":"Storyline: From Dead to Worse (Sookie Stackhouse #8) After the natural disaster of Hurricane Katrina and the manmade explosion at the vampire summit, everyone human and otherwise is stressed, including Louisiana cocktail waitress Sookie Stackhouse, who is trying to cope with the fact that her boyfriend Quinn has gone missing.
