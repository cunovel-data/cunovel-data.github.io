I sat in one of the chairs in front of the desk, the one with the most padding in the seat. Most of the lights in the building were out except the one that stayed on over the bar area and the one in Sam\u0027s office. The building rang with silence after the cacophony of voices rising over the jukebox and the sounds of cooking, washing, footsteps.\\n\\n \"That Sandy Sechrest,\" he said. \"She\u0027s got a whole new job.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah? What the king\u0027s rep supposed to do?\"\\n\\n \"Well, as far as I can tell, she\u0027ll travel the state pretty much constantly, seeing if the citizens have problems with any vampires, seeing if the sheriffs have everything in order and under control in their own fiefs, and reporting in to the king. She\u0027s like an undead troubleshooter.\"\\n\\n \"Oh.\" I thought that over. I couldn\u0027t see that the job would detract from Eric\u0027s. If Eric was okay, his crew would be okay. Other than that, I didn\u0027t care what the vampires did. \"So, she decided to meet you because...?\"\\n\\n \"She understood I had associations in the regional supernatural community,\" Sam said dryly. \"She wanted me to know she was available to consult in the event \u0027problems arose.\u0027 I have her business card.\" He held it up. I don\u0027t know if I expected it to drip with blood or what, but it was only a regular business card.\\n\\n \"Okay.\" I shrugged.\\n\\n \"What did Claudine and her brother want?\" Sam asked.\\n\\n I was feeling very bad about concealing my new great-grandfather from Sam, but Niall had told me to keep him a secret. \"She hadn\u0027t heard from me since the fight in Shreveport,\" I said. \"She just wanted to check up, and she got Claude to come with her.\"\\n\\n Sam looked at me a little sharply but he didn\u0027t comment. \"Maybe,\" he said after a minute, \"this will be a long era of peace.\\n\\n Maybe we can just work in the bar and nothing will happen in the supe community. I\u0027m hoping so, because the time is coming closer and closer when the Weres are going to go public.\"\\n\\n \"You think it\u0027s soon?\" I had no idea how America would react to the news that vampires were not the only things out there in the night. \"You think all the other shifters will announce the same night?\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll have to,\" Sam said. \"We\u0027re talking on our website about it.\"\\n\\n Sam did have a life that was unknown to me. That sparked a thought. I hesitated, then plowed ahead. There were too many questions in my own life. I wanted to get at least some of them answered.\\n\\n \"How\u0027d you come to settle here?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"I\u0027d passed through the area,\" he said. \"I was in the army for four years.\"\\n\\n \"You were?\" I couldn\u0027t believe I hadn\u0027t known that.\\n\\n \"Yeah,\" he said. \"I didn\u0027t know what I wanted to do in my life, so I joined when I was eighteen. My mom cried and my dad swore since I\u0027d been accepted to a college, but I\u0027d made up my mind. I was about the stubbornest teenager on the planet.\"\\n\\n \"Where\u0027d you grow up?\"\\n\\n \"At least partly in Wright, Texas,\" he said. \"Outside of Fort Worth. Way outside of Fort Worth. It wasn\u0027t any bigger than Bon Temps. We moved around all during my childhood, though, because my dad was in the service himself. He got out when I was about fourteen, and my mom\u0027s family was in Wright, so that\u0027s where we went.\"\\n\\n \"Was it hard settling down after moving so much?\" I\u0027d never lived anywhere but Bon Temps.\\n\\n \"It was great,\" he said. \"I was so ready to stay in one place. I hadn\u0027t realized how hard it would be to find my own niche in a group of kids who\u0027d grown up together, but I was able to take care of myself. I played baseball and basketball, so I found my place. Then I joined the army. Go figure.\"\\n\\n I was fascinated. \"Are your mom and dad still in Wright?\" I asked. \"It must have been hard for him in the military, with him being a shifter.\" Since Sam was a shapeshifter, I knew without him having to tell me that he was the first-born child of pure-blooded shapeshifters.\\n\\n \"Yeah, the full moons were a bitch. There was an herbal drink his Irish grandmother used to make. He learned how to make it himself. It was foul beyond belief, but he drank it on full moons when he had to be on duty and had to be seen all night, and that helped him maintain... But you didn\u0027t want to be around him the next day. Dad passed away about six years ago, left me a chunk of money. I\u0027d always liked this area, and this bar was up for sale. It seemed like a good way to invest the money.\"\\n\\n \"And your mom?\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027s still in Wright. She married again about two years after Dad died. He\u0027s a good enough guy. He\u0027s regular.\" Not a shifter or any kind of supernatural. \"So there\u0027s a limit to how close I can get to him,\" Sam said.\\n\\n \"Your mom\u0027s a full-blood. Surely he suspects.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s willfully blind, I think. She has to go out for her evening run, she says, or she\u0027s spending the night with her sister in Waco, or she\u0027s driving over to visit me, or some other excuse.\"\\n\\n \"Must be hard to maintain.\"\\n\\n \"I would never try to do that. I almost married a regular girl once, while I was in the service. But I just couldn\u0027t marry someone and keep that big a secret. It saves my sanity, having someone to talk to about it, Sookie.\" He smiled at me, and I appreciated the trust he was showing. \"If the Weres announce, then we\u0027ll all go public. It\u0027ll be a great burden off me.\"\\n\\n We both knew there would be new problems to face, but there wasn\u0027t any need to talk about future trouble. Trouble always came at its own pace.\\n\\n \"You got any sisters or brothers?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"One of each. My sister is married with two kids, and my brother is still single. He\u0027s a great guy.\" Sam was smiling and his face looked more relaxed than I\u0027d ever seen. \"Craig\u0027s getting married in the spring, he says,\" Sam went on. \"Maybe you can go to the wedding with me.\"\\n\\n I was so astonished I didn\u0027t know what to say, and I was very flattered and pleased. \"That sounds like fun. Tell me when you know the date,\" I said. Sam and I had gone out, once, and it had been very pleasant; but it was in the midst of my problems with Bill and the evening had never been repeated.\\n\\n Sam nodded casually, and the little jolt of tension that had run through me evaporated. After all, this was Sam, my boss, and come to think of it, also one of my best friends. He\u0027d clicked into that slot during the past year. I got up. I had my purse, and I pulled on my jacket.\\n\\n \"Did you get an invitation for the Fangtasia Halloween party this year?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"No. After the last party they invited me to, they might not want me to come back,\" I said. \"Besides, with all the recent losses, I don\u0027t know if Eric\u0027ll feel like celebrating.\"\\n\\n \"You think we ought to have a Halloween party at Merlotte\u0027s?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"Maybe not with candy and stuff like that,\" I said, thinking hard. \"Maybe a goodie bag for each customer, with dry roasted peanuts? Or a bowl of orange popcorn on each table? And some decorations?\"\\n\\n Sam looked in the direction of the bar as if he could see through the walls. \"That sounds good. Make a thing of it.\" Ordinarily we only decorated for Christmas, and that only after Thanksgiving, at Sam\u0027s insistence.\\n\\n I waved good night and left the bar, leaving Sam to check that everything was locked tight.\\n\\n The night had a cold bite to it. This would be one of the Halloweens that really felt like the Halloweens I\u0027d seen in children\u0027s books.\\n\\n In the center of the parking lot, his face turned up to the sliver of moon, his eyes closed, stood my great-grandfather. His pale hair hung down his back like a thick curtain. His myriad of fine creases were invisible in the moonlight, or else he\u0027d divested himself of them. He was carrying his cane, and once again he was wearing a suit, a black suit. There was a heavy ring on his right hand, the hand gripping the cane.\\n\\n He was the most beautiful being I\u0027d ever seen.\\n\\n He didn\u0027t look remotely like a human grandfather. Human grandfathers wore gimme caps from the John Deere place and overalls. They took you fishing. They let you ride on their tractors. They groused at you for being too pampered and then they bought you candy. As for human great-grandfathers, most of us hardly got to know ours.\\n\\n I became aware of Sam standing by my side.\\n\\n \"Who is that?\" he breathed.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s my, ah, my great-granddad,\" I said. He was right there in front of me. I had to explain.\\n\\n \"Oh,\" he said, his voice was full of amazement.\\n\\n \"I just found out,\" I said apologetically.\\n\\n Niall stopped soaking up the moonlight and his eyes opened. \"My great-granddaughter,\" he said, as if my presence in the Merlotte\u0027s parking lot was a pleasant surprise. \"Who is your friend?\"\\n\\n \"Niall, this is Sam Merlotte, who owns this bar,\" I said.\\n\\n Sam extended his hand cautiously, and after a good look at it, Niall touched it with his own. I could feel Sam give a slight jerk, as if my great-grandfather had had a buzzer in his hand.\\n\\n \"Great-granddaughter,\" Niall said, \"I hear you were in danger in the fracas between the werewolves.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, but Sam was with me, and then Claudine came,\" I said, feeling oddly defensive. \"I didn\u0027t know there was going to be a fracas, as you put it, when I went. I was trying to be a peacemaker. We were ambushed.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, that\u0027s what Claudine reported,\" he said. \"I understand the bitch is dead?\"\\n\\n By which he meant Priscilla. \"Yes, sir,\" I said. \"The bitch is dead.\"\\n\\n \"And then you were in danger again one night later?\"\\n\\n I was beginning to feel definitely guilty of something. \"Well, that\u0027s not actually my norm,\" I said. \"It just happened that the vampires of Louisiana got overrun by the vampires of Nevada.\"\\n\\n Niall seemed only mildly interested. \"But you went as far as dialing the number I left you.\"\\n\\n \"Ah, yes, sir, I was pretty scared. But then Eric knocked the phone out of my hand because he thought if you came into the equation, there\u0027d be an out-and-out war. As it turned out, I guess that was for the best, because he surrendered to Victor Madden.\" I was still a little angry about it, though, even after Eric\u0027s gift of the replacement phone.\\n\\n \"Ahhh.\"\\n\\n I couldn\u0027t make head nor tail of that noncommittal sound. This might be the downside of having a great-grandfather on site. I\u0027d been called on the carpet. It was a feeling I hadn\u0027t had since I was a young teen and Gran had found out I\u0027d skipped taking out the trash and folding the laundry. I didn\u0027t like the feeling now any more than I\u0027d liked it then.\\n\\n \"I love your courage,\" Niall said unexpectedly. \"But you are very frail - mortal, breakable, and short-lived. I don\u0027t want to lose you just when I finally became able to speak to you.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know what to say,\" I muttered.\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t want me to stop you from doing anything. You won\u0027t change. How can I protect you?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think you can, not a hundred percent.\"\\n\\n \"Then what use am I to you?\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t have to be of use to me,\" I said, surprised. He didn\u0027t seem to have the emotional set I had. I didn\u0027t know how to explain it to him. \"It\u0027s enough for me - it\u0027s wonderful - just knowing you exist. That you care about me. That I have living family, no matter how distant and different. And you don\u0027t think I\u0027m weird or crazy or embarrassing.\"\\n\\n \"Embarrassing?\" He looked puzzled. \"You\u0027re far more interesting than most humans.\"\\n\\n \"Thank you for not thinking I\u0027m defective,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Other humans think you\u0027re defective?\" Niall sounded genuinely outraged.\\n\\n \"They can\u0027t be comfortable sometimes,\" Sam said unexpectedly. \"Knowing she can read their minds.\"\\n\\n \"But you, shapeshifter?\"\\n\\n \"I think she\u0027s great,\" Sam said. And I could tell he was absolutely sincere.\\n\\n My back straightened. I felt a flush of pride. In the emotional warmth of the moment, I almost told my great-grandfather about the big problem I\u0027d uncovered today, to prove I could share. But I had a pretty good feeling that his solution to the Sandra Pelt-Tanya Grissom Axis of Evil would be to cause their deaths in a macabre way. My sort-of cousin Claudine might be trying to become an angel, a being I associated with Christianity, but Niall Brigant was definitely from another ethos entirely. I suspected his outlook was, \"I\u0027ll take your eye ahead of time, just in case you want mine.\" Well, maybe not that preemptive, but close.\\n\\n \"There is nothing I can do for you?\" He sounded almost plaintive.\\n\\n \"I\u0027d really like it if you\u0027d just come spend some time with me at the house, when you have some to spare. I\u0027d like to cook you supper. If you want to do that?\" It made me feel shy, offering him something I wasn\u0027t sure he\u0027d value.\\n\\n He looked at me with glowing eyes. I could not read his face, and though his body was shaped like a human body, he was not. He was a complete puzzle to me. Maybe he was exasperated or bored or repulsed by my suggestion.\\n\\n Finally Niall said, \"Yes. I\u0027ll do that. I\u0027ll tell you ahead of time, of course. In the meantime, if you need anything of me, call the number. Don\u0027t let anyone dissuade you if you think I can be of help. I will have words with Eric. He\u0027s been useful to me in the past, but he can\u0027t second-guess me with you.\"\\n\\n \"Has he known I was your kin for very long?\" I held my breath, waiting for the answer.\\n\\n Niall had turned to go. Now he turned back a little, so I saw his face in profile. \"No,\" he said. \"I had to know him better, first. I told him only before he brought you to meet me. He wouldn\u0027t help me until I told him why I wanted you.\"\\n\\n And then he was gone. It was like he\u0027d walked through a door we couldn\u0027t see, and for all I knew, that was exactly what he\u0027d done.\\n\\n \"Okay,\" Sam said after a long moment. \"Okay, that was really... different.\"\\n\\n \"Are you all right with all this?\" I waved a hand toward the spot where Niall had been standing. Probably. Unless what we\u0027d seen had been some astral projection or something.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not my place to be okay with it. It\u0027s your thing,\" Sam said.\\n\\n \"I want to love him,\" I said. \"He\u0027s so beautiful and he seems to care so much, but he\u0027s really, really...\"\\n\\n \"Scary,\" Sam finished.\\n\\n \"Yeah.\"\\n\\n \"And he approached you through Eric?\"\\n\\n Since apparently my great-grandfather thought it was okay if Sam knew about him, I told Sam about my first meeting with Niall.\\n\\n \"Hmmm. Well, I don\u0027t know what to make of that. Vampires and fairies don\u0027t interact, because of the vampire tendency to eat fairies.\"\\n\\n \"Niall can mask his scent,\" I explained proudly.\\n\\n Sam looked overloaded with information. \"That\u0027s another thing I\u0027ve never heard of. I hope Jason doesn\u0027t know about this?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, God, no.\"\\n\\n \"You know he\u0027d be jealous and that would make him mad at you.\"\\n\\n \"Since I know Niall and he doesn\u0027t?\"\\n\\n \"Yep. Envy would just eat Jason up.\"\\n\\n \"I know Jason\u0027s not the world\u0027s most generous person,\" I began, to be cut off when Sam snorted. \"Okay,\" I said, \"he\u0027s selfish. But he\u0027s still my brother anyway, and I have to stick by him. But maybe it\u0027s better if I never tell him. Still, Niall didn\u0027t have any problem showing himself to you, after telling me to keep him a secret.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m guessing he did some checking up,\" Sam said mildly. He hugged me, which was a welcome surprise. I felt like I needed a hug after Niall\u0027s drop-in. I hugged Sam back. He felt warm, and comforting, and human.\\n\\n But neither of us was 100 percent human.\\n\\n In the next instant, I thought, We are, too. We had more in common with humans than with the other part of us. We lived like humans; we would die like humans. Since I knew Sam pretty well, I knew he wanted a family and someone to love and a future that contained all the things plain humans want: prosperity, good health, descendants, laughter. Sam didn\u0027t want to be a leader of any pack, and I didn\u0027t want to be princess of anybody - not that any pureblood fairy would ever think I was anything other than a lowly by-product of their own wonder-fulness. That was one of the big differences between Jason and me. Jason would spend his life wishing he was more supernatural than he was; I had spent mine wishing I was less, if my telepathy was indeed supernatural.\\n\\n Sam kissed me on the cheek, and then after a moment\u0027s hesitation, he turned to go into his trailer, walking through the gate in the carefully trimmed hedge and up the steps to the little deck he\u0027d built outside his door. When he\u0027d inserted the key, he turned to smile at me.\\n\\n \"Some night, huh?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah,\" I said. \"Some night.\"\\n\\n Sam watched while I got in my car, made a pressing gesture to remind me to lock my car doors, waited while I complied, and then went into his trailer. I drove home preoccupied with deep questions and shallow ones, and it was lucky there wasn\u0027t any traffic on the road. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/from-dead-to-worse-sookie-stackhouse-8/page-16.html","bookId":2198,"book":{"id":2198,"title":"From Dead to Worse (Sookie Stackhouse #8)","description":"Storyline: From Dead to Worse (Sookie Stackhouse #8) \\n After the natural disaster of Hurricane Katrina and the manmade explosion at the vampire summit, everyone human and otherwise is stressed, including Louisiana cocktail waitress Sookie Stackhouse, who is trying to cope with the fact that her boyfriend Quinn has gone missing. \\n It\u0027s clear that things are changing whether the weres and vamps of her corner of Louisiana like it or not.
