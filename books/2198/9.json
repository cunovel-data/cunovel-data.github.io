{"id":101306,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"It was the middle of the same night and I was about to walk into danger. It was my own damn fault. Through a swift series of phone calls, Alcide and Furnan had worked out where to meet. I\u0027d envisioned them sitting down across a table, their lieutenants right behind them, and working this whole situation out. Mrs. Furnan would appear and the couple would reunite. Everyone would be content, or at least less hostile. I would be nowhere around.\n Yet here I was at an abandoned office center in Shreveport, the same one where the contest for packmaster had taken place. At least Sam was with me. It was dark and cool and the wind was lifting my hair from my shoulders. I shifted from foot to foot, anxious to get this over with. Though he was not as fidgety as I was, I could tell Sam felt the same way.\n It was my fault he was here. When he\u0027d become so curious about what was brewing with the Weres, I\u0027d had to tell him. After all, if someone came through the door of Merlotte\u0027s trying to shoot me down, Sam at least deserved to know why his bar was full of holes. I\u0027d argued bitterly with him when he\u0027d told me he was coming with me, but here we both were.\n Maybe I\u0027m lying to myself. Maybe I simply wanted a friend with me, someone definitely on my side. Maybe I was just scared. Actually, no \"maybe\" about that at all.\n The night was brisk, and we were both wearing waterproof jackets with hoods. Not that we needed the hoods, but if it got any colder, we might be grateful for them. The abandoned office park stretched around us in gloomy silence. We stood in the loading bay of a firm that had accepted big shipments of something. The large metal pull-down doors where the trucks had been unloaded looked like big shiny eyes in the gleam of the remaining security lights.\n Actually, there were lots of big shiny eyes around tonight. The Sharks and the Jets were negotiating. Oh, excuse me, the Furnan Weres and the Herveaux Weres. The two sides of the pack might come to an understanding, and they might not. And right smack dab in the middle stood Sam the Shapeshifter and Sookie the Telepath.\n As I felt the hard red throbbing of Were brains approaching from both north and south, I turned to Sam and said from the bottom of my heart, \"I should never have let you come with me. I should never have opened my mouth.\"\n \"You\u0027ve gotten into the habit of not telling me things, Sookie. I want you to tell me what\u0027s going on with you. Especially if there\u0027s danger.\" Sam\u0027s red gold hair blew around his head in the sharp little breeze wafting between the buildings. I felt his difference more strongly than I ever had. Sam is a rare true shapeshifter. He can change into anything. He prefers the form of a dog, because dogs are familiar and friendly and people don\u0027t shoot at them too often. I looked into his blue eyes and saw the wildness in them. \"They\u0027re here,\" he said, raising his nose to the breeze.\n Then the two groups were standing about ten feet away on either side of us, and it was time to concentrate.\n I recognized the faces of a few of the Furnan wolves, who were more numerous. Cal Myers, the police detective, was among them. It took some kind of nerve for Furnan to bring Cal along when he was proclaiming his innocence. I also recognized the teenage girl Furnan had taken as part of his victory celebration after Jackson Herveaux\u0027s defeat. She looked a million years older tonight.\n Alcide\u0027s group included auburn-haired Amanda, who nodded at me, her face serious, and some werewolves I\u0027d seen at the Hair of the Dog the night Quinn and I had visited the bar. The scrawny girl who\u0027d worn the red leather bustier that night was standing right behind Alcide, and she was both intensely excited and deeply scared. To my surprise, Dawson was there. He wasn\u0027t as much of a lone wolf as he\u0027d painted himself to be.\n Alcide and Furnan stepped away from their packs.\n This was the agreed-on format for the parley, or sit-down, or whatever you wanted to call it: I would stand between Furnan and Alcide. Each Were leader would grip one of my hands. I would be the human lie detector while they talked. I had sworn to tell each one if the other lied, at least to the best of my ability. I could read minds, but minds can be deceptive and tricky or just dense. I\u0027d never done anything exactly like this, and I prayed my ability would be extra precise tonight and that I would use it wisely, so I could help to end this life taking.\n Alcide approached me stiffly, his face harsh in the hard glare of the security lighting. For the first time, I noticed that he looked thinner and older. There was a little gray in the black hair that hadn\u0027t been there when his father had been alive. Patrick Furnan, too, didn\u0027t look well. He\u0027d always had a tendency to porkiness, and now he looked as though he\u0027d gained a good fifteen or twenty pounds. Being packmaster hadn\u0027t been good to him. And the shock of the abduction of his wife had laid its mark on his face.\n I did something that I never imagined I would do. I held out my right hand to him. He took it, and the flood of his ideas washed through me instantly. Even his twisty Were brain was easy to read because he was so focused. I held out my left hand to Alcide, and he grasped it too tightly. For a long minute, I felt inundated. Then, with a huge effort, I channeled them into a stream so I wouldn\u0027t be overwhelmed. It would be easy for them to lie out loud, but it\u0027s not so easy to lie inside your own head. Not consistently. I closed my eyes. A flip of the coin had given Alcide the first question.\n \"Patrick, why did you kill my woman?\" The words sounded like they were cutting up Alcide\u0027s throat. \"She was pure Were, and she was as gentle as a Were can be.\"\n \"I never ordered any of my people to kill any of yours,\" Patrick Furnan said. He sounded so tired he could hardly stand up, and his thoughts were proceeding in much the same way: slowly, wearily, on a track he\u0027d worn in his own brain. He was easier to read than Alcide. He meant what he said.\n Alcide was listening with great attention, and he said next, \"Did you tell anyone not in your pack to kill Maria-Star and Sookie and Mrs. Larrabee?\"\n \"I never gave orders to kill any of you, ever,\" Furnan said.\n \"He believes that,\" I said.\n Unfortunately, Furnan wouldn\u0027t shut up. \"I hate you,\" he said, sounding just as tired as he had before. \"I would be glad if a truck hit you. But I didn\u0027t kill anyone.\"\n \"He believes that, too,\" I said, maybe a little dryly.\n Alcide demanded, \"How can you claim to be innocent with Cal Myers standing with your pack? He stabbed Maria-Star to death.\"\n Furnan looked confused. \"Cal wasn\u0027t there,\" he said.\n \"He believes what he says,\" I told Alcide. I turned my face to Furnan. \"Cal was there, and he murdered Maria-Star.\" Though I dared not lose focus, I heard the whispering start all around Cal Myers, saw the rest of the Furnan Weres step away from him.\n It was Furnan\u0027s turn to ask a question.\n \"My wife,\" he said, and his voice cracked. \"Why her?\"\n \"I didn\u0027t take Libby,\" Alcide said. \"I would never abduct a woman, especially a Were woman with young. I would never order anyone else to do it.\"\n He believed that. \"Alcide didn\u0027t do it himself, and he didn\u0027t order it done.\" But Alcide hated Patrick Furnan with a great ferocity. Furnan hadn\u0027t needed to kill Jackson Herveaux at the climax of the contest, but he had. Better to start his leadership with the elimination of his rival. Jackson would never have submitted to his rule, and would have been a thorn in his side for years. I was getting thoughts from both sides, wafts of ideas so strong it burned in my head, and I said, \"Calm down, both of you.\" I could feel Sam behind me, his warmth, the touch of his mind, and I said, \"Sam, don\u0027t touch me, okay?\"\n He understood, and he moved away.\n \"Neither of you killed any of the people who have died. And neither of you ordered it done. As far as I can tell.\"\n Alcide said, \"Give us Cal Myers to question.\"\n \"Then where is my wife?\" Furnan growled.\n \"Dead and gone,\" said a clear voice. \"And I\u0027m ready to take her place. Cal is mine.\"\n We all looked up, because the voice had come from the flat roof of the building. There were four Weres up there, and the brunette female who\u0027d spoken was closest to the edge. She had a sense of the dramatic, I\u0027ll give her that. Female Weres have power and status but they\u0027re not packleader... ever. This woman was clearly large and in charge, though she was maybe five foot two. She had prepared to change; that is to say, she was naked. Or maybe she just wanted Alcide and Furnan to see what they could be getting. Which was a lot, both in quantity and in quality.\n \"Priscilla,\" said Furnan.\n It seemed like such an unlikely name for the Were that I felt myself actually smile, which was a bad idea under the circumstances.\n \"You know her,\" Alcide said to Furnan. \"Is this part of your plan?\"\n \"No,\" I answered for him. My mind careened through the thoughts I could read and latched on to one thread in particular. \"Furnan, Cal is her creature,\" I said. \"He\u0027s betrayed you.\"\n \"I thought if I picked off a few key bitches, you two would kill each other off,\" Priscilla said. \"Too bad it didn\u0027t work.\"\n \"Who is this?\" Alcide asked Furnan again.\n \"She\u0027s the mate of Arthur Hebert, a packleader from St. Catherine Parish.\" St. Catherine was way south, just east of New Orleans. It had been hit hard by Katrina.\n \"Arthur is dead. We don\u0027t have a home anymore,\" Priscilla Hebert said. \"We want yours.\"\n Well, that was clear enough.\n \"Cal, why have you done this?\" Furnan asked his lieutenant. Cal should have gotten up on the roof while he was able. The Furnan wolves and the Herveaux wolves had formed a circle around him.\n \"Cal\u0027s my brother,\" Priscilla called. \"You better not touch a hair on his body.\" There was an edge of desperation to her voice that hadn\u0027t been there before. Cal looked up at his sister unhappily. He realized what a fix he was in, and I was pretty sure he wanted her to shut up. That would be his last thought.\n Furnan\u0027s arm was suddenly out of its sleeve and covered with hair. With huge force, he swung at his former cohort, eviscerating the Were. Alcide\u0027s clawed hand took off the back of Cal\u0027s head as the traitor fell to the ground. Cal\u0027s blood sprayed over me in an arc. At my back, Sam was humming with the energy of his oncoming change, triggered by the tension, the smell of blood, and my involuntary yelp.\n Priscilla Hebert roared in rage and anguish. With inhuman grace, she leaped from the top of the building to the parking lot, followed by her henchmen (henchwolves?).\n The war had begun.\n Sam and I had worked ourselves into the middle of the Shreveport wolves. As Priscilla\u0027s pack began closing in from each side, Sam said, \"I\u0027m going to change, Sookie.\"\n I couldn\u0027t see what use a collie would be in this situation, but I said, \"Okay, boss.\" He grinned at me in a lopsided way, stripped off his clothes, and bent over. All around us the Weres were doing the same. The chill night air was full of the gloppy sound, the sound of hard things moving through thick, sticky liquid, that characterizes the transformation from man to animal. Huge wolves straightened and shook themselves all around me; I recognized the wolf forms of Alcide and Furnan. I tried counting the wolves in our suddenly reunited pack, but they were milling around, positioning themselves for the coming battle, and there was no way to keep track of them.\n I turned to Sam to give him a pat and found myself standing beside a lion.\n \"Sam,\" I said in a whisper, and he roared.\n Everyone froze in place for a long moment. The Shreveport wolves were just as scared as the St. Catherine\u0027s wolves at first, but then they seemed to realize that Sam was on their side, and yips of excitement echoed between the empty buildings.\n Then the fighting started.\n Sam tried to surround me, which was impossible, but it was a gallant attempt. As an unarmed human, I was basically helpless in this struggle. It was a very unpleasant feeling - in fact, a terrifying feeling.\n I was the frailest thing on site.\n Sam was magnificent. His huge paws flashed, and when he hit a wolf square on, that wolf went down. I danced around like a demented elf, trying to stay out the way. I couldn\u0027t watch everything that was going on. Clusters of St. Catherine wolves made for Furnan, Alcide, and Sam, while individual battles went on around us. I realized that these clusters had been charged with taking down the leaders, and I knew that a lot of planning had gone into this. Priscilla Hebert hadn\u0027t allowed for getting her brother out quickly enough, but that wasn\u0027t slowing her down any.\n No one seemed to be too concerned with me, since I posed no threat. But there was every chance I\u0027d get knocked down by the snarling combatants and be hurt as severely as I would if I had been the target. Priscilla, now a gray wolf, targeted Sam. I guess she wanted to prove she had more balls than anyone by going for the biggest and most dangerous target. But Amanda was biting at Priscilla\u0027s hind legs as Priscilla worked her way through the melee. Priscilla responded by turning her head to bare her teeth at the smaller wolf. Amanda danced away, and then when Priscilla turned to resume her progress, Amanda darted back to bite the leg again. Since Amanda\u0027s bite was powerful enough to break bone, this was more than an annoyance, and Priscilla rounded on her in full display. Before I could even think Oh no, Priscilla seized Amanda in her iron jaws and broke her neck.\n While I stood staring in horror, Priscilla dropped Amanda\u0027s body on the ground and wheeled to leap onto Sam\u0027s back. He shook and shook but she had sunk her fangs into his neck and she would not be dislodged.\n Something in me snapped as surely as the bones in Amanda\u0027s neck. I lost any sense I might have had, and I launched myself in the air as if I were a wolf, too. To keep from sliding off the heaving mass of animals, I wound my arms in the fur around Priscilla\u0027s neck, and I wound my legs around Priscilla\u0027s middle, and I tightened my arms until I was just about hugging myself. Priscilla didn\u0027t want to let go of Sam, so she flung herself from side to side to knock me loose. But I was clinging to her like a homicidal monkey.\n Finally, she had to let go of his neck to deal with me. I squeezed and squeezed harder, and she tried to bite me, but she couldn\u0027t reach around properly since I was on her back. She was able to curve enough to graze my leg with her fangs, but she couldn\u0027t hold on. The pain hardly registered. I tightened my grip even more though my arms were aching like hell. If I let go one little bit, I would join Amanda.\n Though all of this took place so quickly it was hard to believe, I felt as if I\u0027d been trying to kill this woman/wolf for eternity. I wasn\u0027t really thinking, \"Die, die,\" in my head; I just wanted her to stop what she was doing, and she wouldn\u0027t, dammit. Then there was another ear-shattering roar, and huge teeth flashed an inch away from my arms. I understood I should let go, and the second my arms loosened, I tumbled off the wolf, rolling over the pavement to land in a heap a few feet away.\n There was a sort of pop! and Claudine was standing over me. She was in a tank top and pajama bottoms and she had a case of bedhead. From between her striped legs I saw the lion bite the wolf\u0027s head nearly off, then spit her out in a fastidious way. Then he turned to survey the parking lot, evaluating the next threat.\n One of the wolves leaped at Claudine. She proved she was completely awake. While the animal was in midair her hands clamped on its ears. She swung him, using his own momentum. Claudine flung the huge wolf with the ease of a frat boy tossing a beer can, and the wolf smacked against the loading dock with a sound that seemed quite final. The speed of this attack and its conclusion was absolutely incredible.\n Claudine didn\u0027t move from her straddling stance, and I was smart enough to stay put. Actually, I was exhausted, frightened, and a little bloody, though only the red spatter on my leg seemed to be my own. Fighting takes such a short time, yet it uses up the body\u0027s reserves with amazing speed. At least, that\u0027s the way it works with humans. Claudine looked pretty sparky.\n \"Bring it on, fur-ass!\" she shrieked, beckoning with both hands to a Were who was slinking up on her from behind. She\u0027d twisted around without moving her legs, a maneuver that would be impossible for a mundane human body. The Were launched and got exactly the same treatment as its packmate. As far as I could tell, Claudine wasn\u0027t even breathing heavy. Her eyes were wider and more intent than usual, and she held her body in a loose crouch, clearly ready for action.\n There was more roaring, and barking, and growling, and shrieks of pain, and rending noises that didn\u0027t bear thinking about. But after maybe five more minutes of battle, the noise died down.\n Claudine had not even glanced down at me during this time because she was guarding my body. When she did, she winced. So I looked pretty bad.\n \"I was late,\" she said, shifting her feet so she was standing on one side of me. She reached down and I seized her hand. In a flash, I was on my feet. I hugged her. Not only did I want to, I needed to. Claudine always smelled so wonderful, and her body was curiously firmer to the touch than human flesh. She seemed happy to hug me back, and we clung together for a long moment while I regained my equilibrium.\n Then I raised my head to look around, dreading what I would see. The fallen lay in heaps of fur around us. The dark stains on the pavement were not from oil drips. Here and there a bedraggled wolf nosed through the corpses, looking for someone in particular. The lion was crouched a couple of yards away, panting. Blood streaked his fur. There was an open wound on his shoulder, the one caused by Priscilla. There was another bite on his back.\n I didn\u0027t know what to do first. \"Thanks, Claudine,\" I said, and kissed her cheek.\n \"I can\u0027t always make it,\" Claudine cautioned me. \"Don\u0027t count on an automatic rescue.\"\n \"Am I wearing some kind of fairy Life Alert button? How\u0027d you know to come?\" I could tell she wasn\u0027t going to answer. \"Anyway, I sure appreciate this rescue. Hey, I guess you know I met my great-grandfather.\" I was babbling. I was so glad to be alive.\n She bowed her head. \"The prince is my grandfather,\" she said.\n \"Oh,\" I said. \"So, we\u0027re like cousins?\"\n She looked down at me, her eyes clear and dark and calm. She didn\u0027t look like a woman who\u0027d just killed two wolves as quick as you could snap your fingers. \"Yes,\" she said. \"I guess we are.\"\n \"So what do you call him? Granddaddy? Popsy?\"\n \"I call him \u0027my lord.\u0027\"\n \"Oh.\"\n She stepped away to check out the wolves she\u0027d disposed of (I was pretty sure they were still dead), so I went over to the lion. I crouched beside him and put my arm around his neck. He rumbled. Automatically, I scratched the top of his head and behind his ears, just like I did with Bob. The rumble intensified.\n \"Sam,\" I said. \"Thanks so much. I owe you my life. How bad are your wounds? What can I do about them?\"\n Sam sighed. He laid his head on the ground.\n \"You\u0027re tired?\"\n Then the air around him got hyper, and I pulled away from him. I knew what was coming. After a few moments, the body that lay beside me was human, not animal. I ran my eyes over Sam anxiously and I saw that he still had the wounds, but they were much smaller than they\u0027d been on his lion form. All shapeshifters are great at healing. It says a lot about the way my life had changed that it didn\u0027t seem significant to me that Sam was buck naked. I had kind of gone beyond that now - which was good, since there were bare bodies all around me. The corpses were changing back, as well as the injured wolves.\n It had been easier to look at the bodies in wolf form.\n Cal Myers and his sister, Priscilla, were dead, of course, as were the two Weres Claudine had dispatched. Amanda was dead. The skinny girl I\u0027d met in the Hair of the Dog was alive, though severely wounded in the upper thigh. I recognized Amanda\u0027s bartender, too; he seemed unscathed. Tray Dawson was cradling an arm that looked broken.\n Patrick Furnan lay in the middle of a ring of the dead and wounded, all of them Priscilla\u0027s wolves. With some difficulty, I picked my way through broken, bloody bodies. I could feel all the eyes, wolf and human, focus on me as I squatted by him. I put my fingers on his neck and got nothing. I checked his wrist. I even put my hand against his chest. No movement.\n \"Gone,\" I said, and those remaining in wolf form began to howl. Far more disturbing were the howls coming from the throats of the Weres in human form.\n Alcide staggered over to me. He appeared to be more or less intact, though streaks of blood matted his chest hair. He passed the slain Priscilla, kicking her corpse as he went by. He knelt for a moment by Patrick Furnan, dipping his head as though he was bowing to the corpse. Then he rose to his feet. He looked dark, savage, and resolute.\n \"I am the leader of this pack!\" he said in a voice of absolute certainty. The scene became eerily quiet as the surviving wolves absorbed that.\n \"You need to leave now,\" Claudine said very quietly right behind me. I jumped like a rabbit. I\u0027d been mesmerized by the beauty of Alcide, by the primitive wildness rolling off him.\n \"What? Why?\"\n \"They\u0027re going to celebrate their victory and the ascension of a new packmaster,\" she said.\n The skinny girl clenched her hands together and brought them down on the skull of a fallen - but still twitching - enemy. The bones broke with a nasty crunch. All around me the defeated Weres were being executed, at least those who were severely wounded. A small cluster of three scrambled to kneel in front of Alcide, their heads tilted back. Two of them were women. One was an adolescent male. They were offering Alcide their throats in surrender. Alcide was very excited. All over. I remembered the way Patrick Furnan had celebrated when he got the packmaster job. I didn\u0027t know if Alcide was going to fuck the hostages or kill them. I took in my breath to exclaim. I don\u0027t know what I would\u0027ve said, but Sam\u0027s grimy hand clapped over my mouth. I rolled my eyes to glare at him, both angry and agitated, and he shook his head vehemently. He held my gaze for a long moment to make sure I would stay silent, and then he removed his hand. He put his arm around my waist and turned me abruptly away from the scene. Claudine took the rear guard as Sam marched me rapidly away. I kept my eyes forward.\n I tried not to listen to the noises. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/from-dead-to-worse-sookie-stackhouse-8/page-9.html","bookId":2198,"book":{"id":2198,"title":"From Dead to Worse (Sookie Stackhouse #8)","description":"Storyline: \n From Dead to Worse (Sookie Stackhouse #8) \n After the natural disaster of Hurricane Katrina and the manmade explosion at the vampire summit, everyone human and otherwise is stressed, including Louisiana cocktail waitress Sookie Stackhouse, who is trying to cope with the fact that her boyfriend Quinn has gone missing. \n It\u0027s clear that things are changing whether the weres and vamps of her corner of Louisiana like it or not.
