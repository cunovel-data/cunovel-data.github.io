{"id":101312,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"I slept very late the next day. And I slept like a stone. I didn\u0027t dream. I didn\u0027t toss or turn. I didn\u0027t get up to pee. When I woke up, it was close to noon, so it was good I didn\u0027t have to be at Merlotte\u0027s until evening.\\n\\n I could hear voices in the living room. This was the downside of having a roommate. There was someone there when you woke up, and sometimes that person had company. However, Amelia was very good about making enough coffee for me when she got up earlier. That prospect got me out of bed.\\n\\n I had to get dressed since we had company; besides, the other voice sounded masculine. I did a little brisk grooming in the bathroom and threw off my nightgown. I put on a bra and a T-shirt and some khakis. Good enough. I made a beeline for the kitchen and found that Amelia had indeed made a big pot of coffee. And she\u0027d left a mug ready for me. Oh, great. I poured, and popped some sourdough bread in the toaster. The back porch door slammed, and I turned in surprise to see Tyrese Marley enter with an armful of firewood.\\n\\n \"Where do you keep your wood after you bring it in?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"I have a rack by the fireplace in the living room.\" He\u0027d been splitting the wood Jason had cut and stacked by the toolshed the spring before. \"That\u0027s really nice of you,\" I said, floundering. \"Um, have you had any coffee, or some toast? Or...\" I glanced at the clock. \"What about a ham or meatloaf sandwich?\"\\n\\n \"Food sounds good,\" he said, striding down the hall as though the wood weighed nothing.\\n\\n So the guest in the living room was Copley Carmichael. Why Amelia\u0027s dad was here, I had no clue. I scrambled to assemble a couple of sandwiches, poured some water, and put two kinds of chips by his plate so Marley could pick what he wanted. Then I sat down at the table myself and finally got to drink my coffee and eat my toast. I still had some of my grandmother\u0027s plum jam to spread on it, and I tried not to be melancholy every time I used it. No point in letting good jam go to waste. She would have certainly looked at it that way.\\n\\n Marley returned and sat down opposite me with no sign of discomfort. I relaxed myself.\\n\\n \"I appreciate the work,\" I said after he\u0027d had a bite of his food.\\n\\n \"I got nothing else to do while he talks to Amelia,\" Marley said. \"Plus, if she\u0027s still here all winter, he\u0027ll be glad if she can have a fire. Who cut that wood for you and didn\u0027t split it?\"\\n\\n \"My brother,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Humph,\" Marley said, and settled into eating.\\n\\n I finished my toast, poured myself a second mug of coffee, and asked Marley if he needed anything.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m good, thank you,\" he said, and opened the bag of barbecue potato chips.\\n\\n I excused myself to take a shower. It was definitely cooler today, and I got a long-sleeved T-shirt out of a drawer I hadn\u0027t opened in months. It was Halloween weather. It was past time to buy a pumpkin and some candy... not that I got many trick-or-treaters. For the first time in days, I felt normal: that is to say, comfortably happy with myself and my world. There was a lot to grieve about, and I would, but I wasn\u0027t walking around expecting a smack in the face.\\n\\n Of course, the minute I thought that, I began to brood on bad things. I realized I hadn\u0027t heard anything from the Shreveport vampires, and then I wondered why I thought I should or would. This period of adjustment from one regime to another had to be full of tension and negotiation, and it was best to leave them to it. I hadn\u0027t heard from the Weres of Shreveport, either. Since the investigation into the disappearance of all those people was still active, that was a good thing.\\n\\n And since I\u0027d just broken up with my boyfriend, that meant (theoretically) I was footloose and fancy-free. I put on eye makeup as a gesture toward my freedom. And then I added some lipstick. It was hard to feel adventurous, actually. I hadn\u0027t wanted to be fancy-free.\\n\\n As I finished making my bed, Amelia knocked at my door.\\n\\n \"Come on in,\" I said, folding my nightgown and putting it in the drawer. \"What\u0027s up?\"\\n\\n \"Well, my father has a favor to ask you,\" she said.\\n\\n I could feel my face settle into grim lines. Of course, there had to be something Copley wanted if he\u0027d driven up from New Orleans to talk to his daughter. And I could imagine what that request was.\\n\\n \"Go on,\" I said, crossing my arms over my chest.\\n\\n \"Oh, Sookie, your body language is already saying no!\"\\n\\n \"Ignore my body and speak your piece.\"\\n\\n She heaved a big sigh to indicate how reluctant she was to drag me into her dad\u0027s stuff. But I could tell she was tickled pink that he\u0027d asked her to help him. \"Well, since I told him about the Vegas vampire takeover, he wants to reestablish his business link with the vampires. He wants an introduction. He was hoping you could, like, broker that.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t even know Felipe de Castro.\"\\n\\n \"No, but you know that Victor. And he looks like he\u0027s got his eyes on his own advancement.\"\\n\\n \"You know him as well as I do,\" I pointed out.\\n\\n \"Maybe, but what\u0027s more important is that he knows who you are, and I\u0027m just the other woman in the room,\" Amelia said, and I could see her point - though I hated it. \"I mean, he knows who I am, who my dad is, but he really noticed you.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, Amelia,\" I moaned, and for just a moment felt like kicking her.\\n\\n \"I know you won\u0027t like this, but he said he was ready to pay, like, a finder\u0027s fee,\" Amelia muttered, looking embarrassed.\\n\\n I waved my hands in front of me to fan that thought away. I was not going to let my friend\u0027s father pay me money to make a phone call or whatever I had to do. At that moment I knew I\u0027d decided I had to do this for Amelia\u0027s sake.\\n\\n We went to the living room to talk face-to-face with Copley.\\n\\n He greeted me with far more enthusiasm than he\u0027d shown on his previous visit. He fixed his gaze on me, did the whole \"I\u0027m focused on you\" thing. I regarded him with a skeptical eye. Since he was no fool, he picked up on that immediately.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry, Miss Stackhouse, for intruding here so soon after my last visit,\" he said, laying on the smarm. \"But things in New Orleans are so desperate. We\u0027re trying to rebuild to bring the jobs back in. This connection is really important to me, and I employ a lot of people.\"\\n\\n One, I didn\u0027t think Copley Carmichael was hurting for business even without the contracts for rebuilding the vampire properties. Two, I didn\u0027t for a minute think his sole motivation was the improvement of the damaged city; but after a moment of looking into his head, I was willing to concede that accounted for at least a fraction of his urgency.\\n\\n Also, Marley had split the wood for the winter and carried a load in. That counted for more with me than any appeal based on emotion.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll call Fangtasia tonight,\" I said. \"I\u0027ll see what they say. That\u0027s the limit of my involvement.\"\\n\\n \"Miss Stackhouse, I\u0027m indeed indebted,\" he said. \"What can I do for you?\"\\n\\n \"Your chauffeur already did it,\" I said. \"If he could finish splitting that oak, that would be a great favor.\" I\u0027m not a very good wood splitter, and I know because I\u0027ve tried. Three or four logs done, and I\u0027m wiped out.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s what he\u0027s been doing?\" Copley did a good job of looking astonished. I wasn\u0027t sure if it was genuine or not. \"Well, how enterprising of Marley.\"\\n\\n Amelia was smiling and trying not to let her dad notice it. \"Okay, then we\u0027re settled,\" she said briskly. \"Dad, can I fix you a sandwich or soup? We have some chips or some potato salad.\"\\n\\n \"Sounds good,\" he said, since he was still trying to be just plain folks.\\n\\n \"Marley and I have already eaten,\" I said casually, and added, \"I need to run to town, Amelia. You need anything?\"\\n\\n \"I could use some stamps,\" she said. \"You going by the post office?\"\\n\\n I shrugged. \"It\u0027s on the way. Bye, Mr. Carmichael.\"\\n\\n \"Call me Cope, please, Sookie.\"\\n\\n I\u0027d just known he was going to say that. Next he was going to try being courtly. Sure enough, he smiled at me with exactly the right blend of admiration and respect.\\n\\n I got my purse and headed out the back door. Marley was still working on the woodpile in his shirtsleeves. I hoped that had been his very own idea. I hoped he got a raise.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t really have anything to do in town. But I had wanted to dodge any further conversation with Amelia\u0027s dad. I stopped by the store and got some more paper towels, bread, and tuna, and I stopped by the Sonic and got an Oreo Blast. Oh, I was a bad girl, no doubt about it. I was sitting in my car working on the Blast when I spied an interesting couple two cars away. They hadn\u0027t noticed me, apparently, because Tanya and Arlene were talking steadily. The two were in Tanya\u0027s Mustang. Arlene\u0027s hair was newly colored, so it was flaming red to the roots, caught up at the back in a banana clip. My former friend was wearing a tiger-print knit top, all I could see of her ensemble. Tanya was wearing a pretty lime green blouse and a dark brown sweater. And she was listening intently.\\n\\n I tried to believe they were talking about something other than me. I mean, I try not to be too paranoid. But when you see your ex-buddy talking to your known enemy, you have to at least entertain the possibility that the topic of you has come up in an unflattering way.\\n\\n It wasn\u0027t so much that they didn\u0027t like me. I\u0027ve known people all my life who didn\u0027t like me. I\u0027ve known exactly why and how much they didn\u0027t like me. That\u0027s really unpleasant, as you can well imagine. What bothered me was that I thought Arlene and Tanya were moving into the realm of actually doing something to me.\\n\\n I wondered what I could find out. If I moved closer, they\u0027d definitely notice me, but I wasn\u0027t sure I could \"hear\" them from where I was. I bent over like I was fiddling with my CD player, and I focused on them. I tried to mentally skip over or plow through the people in the intervening cars to reach them, which wasn\u0027t an easy task.\\n\\n Finally, the familiar pattern of Arlene helped me to home in. The first impression I got was one of pleasure. Arlene was enjoying herself immensely, since she had the undivided attention of a fairly new audience and she was getting to talk about her new boyfriend\u0027s convictions about the need to kill all vampires and maybe people who collaborated with them. Arlene had no hard convictions that she\u0027d formed for herself, but she was great at adopting other people\u0027s if they suited her emotionally.\\n\\n When Tanya had an especially strong surge of exasperation, I zoomed in on her thought pattern. I was in. I remained in my half-concealed position, my hand moving every now and then over the CDs in my little car folder, while I tried to pick out everything I could.\\n\\n Tanya was still in the pay of the Pelts: Sandra Pelt, specifically. And gradually I came to understand that Tanya had been sent here to do anything she could to make me miserable.\\n\\n Sandra Pelt was the sister of Debbie Pelt, whom I\u0027d shot to death in my kitchen. (After she\u0027d tried to kill me. Several times. Let me point that out.)\\n\\n Dammit. I was sick to death of the issue of Debbie Pelt. The woman had been a bane to me alive. She had been as malicious and vindictive as her little sister, Sandra. I\u0027d suffered over her death, felt guilty, felt remorseful, felt like I had a huge C for \"Cain\" on my forehead. Killing a vampire is bad enough, but the corpse goes away and they\u0027re sort of... erased. Killing another human being changes you forever.\\n\\n That\u0027s how it ought to be.\\n\\n But it\u0027s possible to grow sick of that feeling, tired of that albatross around your emotional neck. And I\u0027d grown both sick and tired of Debbie Pelt. Then her sister and her parents had begun giving me grief, had had me kidnapped. The tables had turned, and I\u0027d held them in my power. In return for me letting them go, they\u0027d agreed to leave me alone. Sandra had promised to stay away until her parents died. I had to wonder if the elder Pelts were still among the living.\\n\\n I started up my car and began cruising around Bon Temps, waving at familiar faces in almost every vehicle I passed. I had no idea what to do. I stopped at the little town park and got out of my car. I began to stroll, my hands jammed in my pockets. My head was all in a snarl.\\n\\n I remembered the night I\u0027d confessed to my first lover, Bill, that my great-uncle had molested me when I\u0027d been a child. Bill had taken my story so to heart that he had arranged for a visitor to drop by my great-uncle\u0027s house. Lo and behold, my uncle had died from a fall down the stairs. I\u0027d been furious at Bill for taking over my own past. But I couldn\u0027t deny that having my great-uncle dead had felt good. That profound relief had made me feel complicit in the assassination.\\n\\n When I\u0027d been trying to find survivors in the twisted debris of the Pyramid of Gizeh, I\u0027d found someone still living, a vampire who wanted to keep me firmly under his control for the queen\u0027s benefit. Andre had been terribly wounded, but he would have lived if an injured Quinn hadn\u0027t crawled over and snuffed Andre out. I\u0027d walked away without stopping Quinn or saving Andre, and that had made me several degrees more guilty of Andre\u0027s death than of my great-uncle\u0027s.\\n\\n I strode through the empty park, kicking at the stray leaves that came my way. I was struggling with a sick temptation. I had only to say the word to any of many members of the supernatural community, and Tanya would be dead. Or I could set my sights on the source and have Sandra taken out. And again - what a relief her departure from the world would be.\\n\\n I just couldn\u0027t do it.\\n\\n But I couldn\u0027t live with Tanya nipping at my heels, either. She\u0027d done her best to ruin my brother\u0027s already shaky relationship with his wife. That was just wrong.\\n\\n I finally thought of the right person to consult. And she lived with me, so that was convenient.\\n\\n When I got back to my house, Amelia\u0027s dad and his obliging chauffeur had departed. Amelia was in the kitchen, washing dishes.\\n\\n \"Amelia,\" I said, and she jumped. \"Sorry,\" I apologized. \"I should\u0027ve walked heavier.\"\\n\\n \"I was hoping that my dad and I understood each other a little better,\" she confessed. \"But I don\u0027t think that\u0027s really true. He just needs me to do something for him now and then.\"\\n\\n \"Well, at least we got the firewood split.\"\\n\\n She laughed a little and dried off her hands. \"You look like you have something big to say.\"\\n\\n \"I want to clear the decks before I tell you this long story. I\u0027m doing your dad a favor, but I\u0027m really doing it for you,\" I said. \"I\u0027ll call Fangtasia for your father no matter what, because you\u0027re my roommate and that\u0027ll make you happy. So that\u0027s a done deal. Now I\u0027m going to tell you about a terrible thing I did.\"\\n\\n Amelia sat at the table and I sat opposite her, just like Marley and I had done earlier. \"This sounds interesting,\" she said. \"I\u0027m ready. Bring it on.\"\\n\\n I told Amelia all about it: Debbie Pelt, Alcide, Sandra Pelt and her parents, their vow that Sandra would never bother me again while they lived. What they had on me and how I felt about it. Tanya Grissom, spy and sneak and saboteur of my brother\u0027s marriage.\\n\\n \"Whoa,\" she said when I\u0027d finished. She thought for a minute. \"Okay, first off, let\u0027s check on Mr. and Mrs. Pelt.\" We used the computer I\u0027d brought back from Hadley\u0027s apartment in New Orleans. It took all of five minutes to discover that Gordon and Barbara Pelt had died two weeks before when they\u0027d attempted to make a left turn into a gas station only to be hit broadside by a tractor trailer.\\n\\n We looked at each other, our noses wrinkled. \"Ewww,\" Amelia said. \"Bad way to go.\"\\n\\n \"I wonder if she even waited till they were in the ground before she activated the Aggravate Sookie to Death plan,\" I said.\\n\\n \"This bitch isn\u0027t going to let up. You sure Debbie Pelt was adopted? Because this totally vindictive attitude seems to run in that family.\"\\n\\n \"They must have really bonded,\" I said. \"In fact, I got the impression that Debbie was more of a sister to Sandra than she was a daughter to her parents.\"\\n\\n Amelia nodded thoughtfully. \"A little pathology going on there,\" she said. \"Well, let me think about what I can do. I don\u0027t do death magic. And you\u0027ve said you don\u0027t want Tanya and Sandra to die, so I\u0027m taking you at your word.\"\\n\\n \"Good,\" I said briefly. \"And, uh, I\u0027m willing to pay for this, of course.\"\\n\\n \"Poo,\" Amelia said. \"You were willing to take me in when I needed to get out of town. You\u0027ve put up with me all this time.\"\\n\\n \"Well, you do pay rent,\" I pointed out.\\n\\n \"Yeah, enough to cover my part of the utilities. And you put up with me, and you don\u0027t seem to be all up in arms about the Bob situation. So believe me, I\u0027m really glad to do this for you. I\u0027ve just got to figure out what I\u0027m actually going to do. Do you mind if I consult with Octavia?\"\\n\\n \"No, not at all,\" I said, trying not to show that I was relieved at the idea of the older witch offering her expertise. \"You got it, right? Got that she was at loose ends? Out of money?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah,\" Amelia said. \"And I don\u0027t know how to give her some without offering offense. This is a good way to do it. I understand that she\u0027s stuck in a random corner of the living room in the house of the niece she\u0027s staying with. She told me that - more or less - but I don\u0027t know what I can do about it.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll think about it,\" I promised. \"If she really, really needs to move out of her niece\u0027s, she could stay in my extra bedroom for a little while.\" That wasn\u0027t an offer that delighted me, but the old witch had seemed pretty miserable. She\u0027d been entertained by going on the little jaunt to poor Maria-Star\u0027s apartment, which had been a ghastly sight.\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll try to come up with something long-term,\" Amelia said. \"I\u0027m going to go give her a call.\"\\n\\n \"Okay. Let me know what you-all come up with. I got to get ready for work.\"\\n\\n There weren\u0027t too many houses between mine and Merlotte\u0027s, but all of them had ghosts hanging from trees, inflated plastic pumpkins in the yard, and a real pumpkin or two sitting on the front porch. The Prescotts had a sheaf of corn, a bale of hay, and some ornamental squash and pumpkins arranged artfully on the front lawn. I made a mental memo to tell Lorinda Prescott how attractive it was when next I saw her at Wal-Mart or the post office.\\n\\n By the time I got to work, it was dark. I got out my cell phone to call Fangtasia before I went inside.\\n\\n \"Fangtasia, the bar with a bite. Come into Shreveport\u0027s premier vampire bar, where the undead do their drinking every single night,\" said a recording. \"For bar hours, press one. To schedule a private party, press two. To speak to a live human or a dead vampire, press three. And know this: prank calls are not tolerated. We will find you.\"\\n\\n I was sure the voice was Pam\u0027s. She\u0027d sounded remarkably bored. I pressed three.\\n\\n \"Fangtasia, where all your undead dreams come true,\" said one of the fangbangers. \"This is Elvira. How may I direct you?\"\\n\\n Elvira, my ass. \"This is Sookie Stackhouse. I need to speak with Eric,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Could Clancy help you?\" Elvira asked.\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n Elvira seemed stumped.\\n\\n \"The master is very busy,\" she said, as if that would be hard for a human like me to understand.\\n\\n Elvira was definitely a newbie. Or maybe I was getting kind of arrogant. I was irritated with \"Elvira.\"\\n\\n \"Listen,\" I said, trying to sound pleasant. \"You get Eric on the phone in two minutes or he\u0027ll be mighty unhappy with you.\"\\n\\n \"Well,\" Elvira said. \"You don\u0027t have to be a bitch about it.\"\\n\\n \"Evidently I do.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m putting you on hold,\" Elvira said viciously. I glanced at the employee door of the bar. I needed to hustle.\\n\\n Click. \"This is Eric,\" he said. \"Is this my former lover?\"\\n\\n Okay, even that made things inside me thud and shiver in excitement. \"Yeah, yeah, yeah,\" I said, proud of how unshaken I sounded. \"Listen, Eric, for what it\u0027s worth, I had a visit today from a New Orleans bigwig named Copley Carmichael. He\u0027d been involved with Sophie-Anne in some business negotiations about rebuilding the headquarters. He wants to establish a relationship with the new regime.\" I took a deep breath. \"Are you okay?\" I asked, negating in one plaintive question all my cultivated indifference.\\n\\n \"Yes,\" he said, his voice intensely personal. \"Yes, I am... coping with this. We are very, very lucky we were in a position to... We\u0027re very lucky.\"\\n\\n I let out my breath very softly so he wouldn\u0027t pick up on it. Of course, he would anyway. I can\u0027t say I\u0027d been on pins and needles wondering how things were going with the vampires, but I hadn\u0027t been resting very easy, either. \"Okay, very good,\" I said briskly. \"Now, about Copley. Is there anyone around who\u0027d like to hook up with him about the construction stuff?\"\\n\\n \"Is he in the area?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know. He was here this morning. I can ask.\"\\n\\n \"The vampire I am working with now would probably be the right woman for him to approach. She could meet him at your bar or here at Fangtasia.\"\\n\\n \"Okay. I\u0027m sure he\u0027d do either one.\"\\n\\n \"Let me know. He needs to call here to set up an appointment. He should ask for Sandy.\"\\n\\n I laughed. \"Sandy, huh?\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" he said, sounding grim enough to sober me in a hurry. \"She is not a bit funny, Sookie.\"\\n\\n \"Okay, okay, I get it. Let me call his daughter, she\u0027ll call him, he\u0027ll call Fangtasia, it\u0027ll all get set up, and I\u0027ve done my favor for him.\"\\n\\n \"This is Amelia\u0027s father?\"\\n\\n \"Yes. He\u0027s a jerk,\" I said. \"But he\u0027s her dad, and I guess he knows his building stuff.\"\\n\\n \"I lay in front of your fire and talked to you about your life,\" he said.\\n\\n Okay, way out of left field. \"Uh. Yeah. We did that.\"\\n\\n \"I remember our shower together.\"\\n\\n \"We did that, too.\"\\n\\n \"We did so many things.\"\\n\\n \"Ah... yeah. Okay.\"\\n\\n \"In fact, if I didn\u0027t have so much to do here in Shreveport, I would be tempted to visit you all by myself to remind you how much you enjoyed those things.\"\\n\\n \"If memory serves,\" I said sharply, \"you kind of enjoyed them, too.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, yes.\"\\n\\n \"Eric, I really need to go. I got to get to work.\" Or spontaneously combust, whichever came first.\\n\\n \"Good-bye.\" He could make even that sound sexy.\\n\\n \"Good-bye.\" I didn\u0027t.\\n\\n It took me a second to gather my thoughts back together. I was remembering things I\u0027d tried hard to forget. The days Eric had stayed with me - well, the nights - we\u0027d done a lot of talking and a lot of sexing. And it had been wonderful. The companionship. The sex. The laughing. The sex. The conversations. The... well.\\n\\n Somehow going in to serve beers seemed drab, all of a sudden.\\n\\n But that was my job, and I owed it to Sam to show up and work. I trudged in, stowed my purse, and nodded to Sam as I tapped Holly on the shoulder to tell her I was here to take over. We switched shifts for the change and convenience but mostly because the night tips were higher. Holly was glad to see me because she had a date that night with Hoyt. They were going to a movie and dinner in Shreveport. She\u0027d gotten a teenager to babysit Cody. She was telling me this as I was getting it from her contented brain, and I had to work hard not to get confused. That showed me how rattled I\u0027d been by my conversation with Eric.\\n\\n I was really busy for about thirty minutes, making sure everyone was well-supplied with drinks and food. I caught a moment to call Amelia soon after that to relay Eric\u0027s message, and she told me that she\u0027d call her dad the minute she hung up. \"Thanks, Sook,\" she said. \"Again, you\u0027re a great roomie.\"\\n\\n I hoped she\u0027d think of that when she and Octavia were devising a magical solution to my Tanya problem.\\n\\n Claudine came into Merlotte\u0027s that evening, raising male pulses as she sauntered to the bar. She was wearing a green silk blouse, black pants, and black high-heeled boots. That made her at least six foot one, I estimated. To my amazement, her twin brother, Claude, trailed in after her. The racing pulses spread to the opposite sex with the speed of wildfire. Claude, whose hair was as black as Claudine\u0027s, though not as long, was as lovely a hunk as ever posed in a Calvin Klein ad. Claude was wearing a masculine version of Claudine\u0027s outfit, and he\u0027d tied his hair back with a leather thong. He was also wearing very \"guy\" boots. Since he stripped at a club in Monroe on ladies\u0027 night, Claude knew exactly how to smile at women, though he wasn\u0027t interested in them. I take that back. He was interested in how much money they had in their purses.\\n\\n The twins had never come in together; in fact, I didn\u0027t recall Claude setting foot in Merlotte\u0027s before. He had his own place to run, his own fish to fry.\\n\\n Of course I went over to say hi, and I got a comprehensive hug from Claudine. To my amazement, Claude followed suit. I figured he was playing to the audience, which was pretty much the whole bar. Even Sam was goggling; together, the fairy twins were overwhelming.\\n\\n We stood at the bar with me sandwiched between them, each with an arm around me, and I heard brains light up all around the room with little fantasies, some of which startled even me, and I\u0027ve seen the most bizarre things people can imagine. Yep, it\u0027s all there for lucky me to see in living color.\\n\\n \"We bring you greetings from our grandfather,\" Claude said. His voice was so quiet and liquid that I was sure no one else would be able to hear it. Possibly Sam could, but he was always good for discretion.\\n\\n \"He wonders why you haven\u0027t called,\" Claudine said, \"especially considering the events of the other night, in Shreveport.\"\\n\\n \"Well, that was over with,\" I said, surprised. \"Why tell him about something that had already turned out okay? You were there. But I did try to call him the other night.\"\\n\\n \"It rang once,\" Claudine murmured.\\n\\n \"However, a certain person broke my phone so I couldn\u0027t complete the call. He told me it was the wrong thing to do, that it would start a war. I lived through that, too. So that was okay.\"\\n\\n \"You need to talk to Niall, tell him the whole story,\" Claudine said. She smiled across the room at Catfish Hennessy, who put his beer mug down on the table so hard that it slopped over. \"Now that Niall\u0027s made himself known to you, he wants you to confide in him.\"\\n\\n \"Why can\u0027t he pick up the phone like everyone else in the world?\"\\n\\n \"He doesn\u0027t spend all his time in this world,\" Claude said. \"There are still places for only our kind.\"\\n\\n \"Very small places,\" Claudine said longingly. \"But very special.\"\\n\\n I was glad to have kin, and I was always glad to see Claudine, who was literally my lifesaver. But the two sibs together were a little overpowering, overwhelming - and when they stood so close with me crowded between them (even Sam was having a visual from that), their sweet smell, the smell that made them so intoxicating to vampires, was drowning my poor nose.\\n\\n \"Look,\" Claude said, mildly amused. \"I think we have company.\"\\n\\n Arlene was sidling nearer, looking at Claude as if she\u0027d spied a whole plate of barbecue and onion rings. \"Who\u0027s your friend, Sookie?\" she asked.\\n\\n \"This is Claude,\" I said. \"He\u0027s my distant cousin.\"\\n\\n \"Well, Claude, nice to meet ya,\" Arlene said.\\n\\n She had some nerve, considering the way she felt about me now and how she\u0027d treated me since she\u0027d started going to the Fellowship of the Sun services.\\n\\n Claude looked massively uninterested. He nodded.\\n\\n Arlene had expected more, and after a moment of silence, she pretended to hear someone from one of her tables calling her. \"Gotta go get a pitcher!\" she said brightly, and bustled off. I saw her bend over a table, talking very seriously to a couple of guys I didn\u0027t know.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s always good to see you two, but I am at work,\" I said. \"So, did you just come to tell me my... that Niall wants to know why I called once and hung up?\"\\n\\n \"And never called thereafter to explain,\" Claudine said. She bent down to kiss my cheek. \"Please call him tonight when you get off work.\"\\n\\n \"Okay,\" I said. \"I still wish he\u0027d called me himself to ask.\" Messengers were all well and good, but the phone was quicker. And I\u0027d like to hear his voice. No matter where my great-grandfather might be, he could wink back into this world to call if he really was that taxed about my safety.\\n\\n I thought he could, anyway.\\n\\n Of course, I didn\u0027t know what being a fairy prince entailed. Write that down under \"problems I know I\u0027ll never face.\"\\n\\n After another round of hugs and kisses, the twins sauntered out of the bar, and many wistful eyes followed them on their progress out the door.\\n\\n \"Hoo, Sookie, you got some hot friends!\" Catfish Hennessy called, and there was a general tide of agreement.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve seen that guy at a club in Monroe. Doesn\u0027t he strip?\" said a nurse named Debi Murray who worked at the hospital in nearby Clarice. She was sitting with a couple of other nurses.\\n\\n \"Yeah,\" I said. \"He owns the club, too.\"\\n\\n \"Looks and loot,\" said one of the other nurses. Her name was Beverly something. \"I\u0027m taking my daughter next ladies\u0027 night. She just broke up with a real loser.\"\\n\\n \"Well...\" I debated explaining that Claude wouldn\u0027t be interested in anyone\u0027s daughter, then decided that wasn\u0027t my responsibility. \"Have a good time,\" I said instead.\\n\\n Since I\u0027d taken time out with my sort-of cousins, I had to hustle to sweeten everyone up. Though they hadn\u0027t had my attention during the visit, they had had the entertainment of the twins, so no one was really miffed.\\n\\n Toward the end of my shift, Copley Carmichael walked in.\\n\\n He looked funny alone. I assumed Marley was waiting in the car.\\n\\n In his beautiful suit and with his expensive haircut, he didn\u0027t exactly fit in, but I got to give him credit: he acted like he came into places like Merlotte\u0027s all the time. I happened to be standing by Sam, who was mixing a bourbon and Coke for one of my tables. I explained to Sam who the stranger was.\\n\\n I delivered the drink and nodded at an empty table. Mr. Carmichael took the hint and settled in.\\n\\n \"Hey! Can I get you a drink, Mr. Carmichael?\" I said.\\n\\n \"Please get me a single malt scotch,\" he said. \"Whatever you\u0027ve got will be fine. I\u0027m meeting someone here, Sookie, thanks to your phone call. You just tell me the next time you need anything, and I\u0027ll do everything in my power to make it happen.\"\\n\\n \"Not necessary, Mr. Carmichael.\"\\n\\n \"Please, call me Cope.\"\\n\\n \"Um-hmmm. Okay, let me get your scotch.\"\\n\\n I didn\u0027t know a single malt scotch from a hole in the ground, but Sam did, of course, and he gave me a shining clean glass with a very respectable shot of it. I serve liquor, but I seldom drink it. Most folks around here drink the real obvious stuff: beer, bourbon and Coke, gin and tonic, Jack Daniel\u0027s.\\n\\n I set the drink and cocktail napkin on the table in front of Mr. Carmichael, and I returned with a little bowl of snack mix.\\n\\n Then I left him alone, because I had other people to tend to. But I kept track of him. I noticed Sam was keeping a careful eye on Amelia\u0027s dad, too. But everyone else was too involved in their own conversations and their own drinking to give much mind to the stranger, one not nearly as interesting as Claude and Claudine.\\n\\n In a moment when I wasn\u0027t looking, a vampire joined Cope. I don\u0027t think anyone else knew what she was. She was a real recent vamp, by which I mean she\u0027d died in the past fifty years, and she had prematurely silver hair that was cut in a modest chin-length style. She was small, maybe five foot two, and she was round and firm in all the right places. She was wearing little silver-rimmed glasses that were sheer affectation, because I\u0027d never met a vampire whose eyesight wasn\u0027t absolutely perfect and in fact sharper than any human\u0027s.\\n\\n \"Can I get you some blood?\" I asked.\\n\\n Her eyes were like lasers. Once she was really giving you her attention, you were sorry.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re the woman Sookie,\" she said.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t see any need to affirm what she was so sure of. I waited.\\n\\n \"A glass of TrueBlood, please,\" she said. \"Quite warm. And I\u0027d like to meet your boss, if you would fetch him.\"\\n\\n Like Sam was a bone. Nonetheless, she was a customer and I was a barmaid. So I heated a TrueBlood for her and told Sam he was wanted.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll be there in a minute,\" he said, because he was getting a tray of drinks ready for Arlene.\\n\\n I nodded and took the blood over to the vampire.\\n\\n \"Thank you,\" she said civilly. \"I\u0027m Sandy Sechrest, the new area rep for the King of Louisiana.\"\\n\\n I had no idea where Sandy had grown up, but it had been in the United States and had not been in the south. \"Pleased to meet you,\" I said, but not with a whole lot of enthusiasm. Area rep? Wasn\u0027t that what sheriffs were, among their other functions? What did that mean for Eric?\\n\\n At that moment Sam came to the table, and I left because I didn\u0027t want to look inquisitive. Besides, I could probably pick it up from his brain later if Sam chose not to tell me what the new vampire wanted. He was good at blocking, but he had to make a special effort to do it.\\n\\n The three engaged in a conversation for a couple of minutes, then Sam excused himself to get back behind the bar.\\n\\n I glanced at the vampire and the mogul from time to time in case they needed something more to drink, but neither of them indicated a thirst. They were talking very seriously, and both of them were adept at maintaining a poker face. I didn\u0027t care enough to try to latch onto Mr. Carmichael\u0027s thoughts, and of course Sandy Sechrest was a blank to me.\\n\\n The rest of the night was the usual stuff. I didn\u0027t even notice when the new king\u0027s rep and Mr. Carmichael left. Then it was time to close everything out and get my tables ready for Terry Bellefleur to come in and clean early in the morning. By the time I really looked around me, everyone was gone but Sam and me.\\n\\n \"Hey, you through?\" he said.\\n\\n \"Yeah,\" I said after another look around.\\n\\n \"You got a minute?\"\\n\\n I always had a minute for Sam. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/from-dead-to-worse-sookie-stackhouse-8/page-15.html","bookId":2198,"book":{"id":2198,"title":"From Dead to Worse (Sookie Stackhouse #8)","description":"Storyline: From Dead to Worse (Sookie Stackhouse #8) \\n After the natural disaster of Hurricane Katrina and the manmade explosion at the vampire summit, everyone human and otherwise is stressed, including Louisiana cocktail waitress Sookie Stackhouse, who is trying to cope with the fact that her boyfriend Quinn has gone missing. \\n It\u0027s clear that things are changing whether the weres and vamps of her corner of Louisiana like it or not.
