{"id":101315,"no":18,"title":"Page 18","content":"After a quiet and peaceful Monday off, I went in Tuesday to work the lunch shift. When I\u0027d left home, Amelia had been painting a chest of drawers she\u0027d found at the local junk store. Octavia had been trimming the dead heads off the roses. She\u0027d said they needed pruning back for the winter, and I\u0027d told her to have at it. My grandmother had been the rose person in our household, and she hadn\u0027t let me lay a finger on them unless they needed spraying for aphids. That had been one of my jobs.\n Jason came into Merlotte\u0027s for lunch with a bunch of his coworkers. They put two tables together and formed a cluster of happy men. Cooler weather and no big storms made for happy parish road crews. Jason seemed almost overly animated, his brain a jumble of leaping thoughts. Maybe having the pernicious influence of Tanya erased had already made a difference. But I made a real effort to stay out of his head, because after all, he was my brother.\n When I carried a big tray of Cokes and tea over to the table, Jason said, \"Crystal says hey.\"\n \"How\u0027s she feeling today?\" I asked, to show proper concern, and Jason made a circle of his forefinger and thumb. I served the last mug of tea, careful to put it down evenly so it wouldn\u0027t spill, and I asked Dove Beck, a cousin of Alcee\u0027s, if he wanted any extra lemon.\n \"No, thanks,\" he said politely. Dove, who\u0027d gotten married the day after graduation, was a whole different kettle of fish from Alcee. At thirty, he was younger, and as far as I could tell - and I could tell pretty far - he didn\u0027t have that inner core of anger that the detective did. I\u0027d gone to school with one of Dove\u0027s sisters.\n \"How\u0027s Angela?\" I asked him, and he smiled.\n \"She married Maurice Kershaw,\" he said. \"They got a little boy, cutest kid in the world. Angela\u0027s a new woman - she don\u0027t smoke or drink, and she\u0027s in church when the doors open.\"\n \"I\u0027m glad to hear that. Tell her I asked,\" I said, and began taking orders. I heard Jason telling his buddies about a fence he was going to build, but I didn\u0027t have time to pay attention.\n Jason lingered after the other men were going out to their vehicles. \"Sook, would you run by and check on Crystal when you get off?\"\n \"Sure, but won\u0027t you be leaving work then?\"\n \"I got to go over to Clarice and pick up some chain-link. Crystal wants us to fence in some of the backyard for the baby. So it\u0027ll have a safe place to play.\"\n I was surprised that Crystal was showing that much foresight and maternal instinct. Maybe having the baby would change her. I thought about Angela Kershaw and her little boy.\n I didn\u0027t want to count up how many girls younger than me had been married for years and had babies - or just had the babies. I told myself envy was a sin, and I worked hard, smiling and nodding to everyone. Luckily, it was a busy day. During the afternoon lull, Sam asked me to help him take inventory in the storeroom while Holly covered the bar and the floor. We only had our two resident alcoholics to serve, so Holly was not going to have to work very hard. Since I was very nervous with Sam\u0027s Blackberry, he entered the totals while I counted, and I had to climb up on a stepladder and then back down about fifty times, counting and dusting. We bought our cleaning supplies in bulk. We counted all those, too. Sam was just a counting fool today.\n The storeroom doesn\u0027t have any windows, so it got pretty warm in there while we were working. I was glad to get out of its stuffy confines when Sam was finally satisfied. I pulled a spiderweb out of his hair as I went by on my way to the bathroom, where I scrubbed my hands and carefully wiped my face, checking my ponytail (as best I could) for any spiderwebs I might have picked up myself.\n As I left the bar, I was so looking forward to getting in the shower that I almost turned left to go home. Just in time, I remembered I\u0027d promised to look in on Crystal, so I turned right instead.\n Jason lived in my parents\u0027 house, and he\u0027d kept it up very nicely. My brother was a house-proud kind of guy. He didn\u0027t mind spending his free time on painting, mowing, and basic repairs, a side of him I always found a bit surprising. He\u0027d recently painted the outside a buff color and the trim a glowing white, and the little house looked very spruce. There was a driveway that made a U shape in front. He\u0027d added a branch that led to the porte cochere in back of the house, but I pulled up to the front steps. I stuffed my car keys in my pocket and crossed the porch. I turned the knob because I planned on sticking my head in the door and calling to Crystal, since I was family. The front door was unlocked, as most front doors were during the daytime. The family room was empty.\n \"Hey, Crystal, it\u0027s Sookie!\" I called, though I tried to keep my voice subdued so I wouldn\u0027t startle her if she were napping.\n I heard a muffled sound, a moan. It came from the biggest bedroom, the one my parents had used, which lay across the family room and to my right.\n Oh, shit, she\u0027s miscarrying again, I thought, and dashed to the closed door. I flung it open so hard it bounced off the wall, but I didn\u0027t pay a bit of attention, because bouncing on the bed were Crystal and Dove Beck.\n I was so shocked, so angry, and so distraught that as they stopped what they were doing and stared up at me, I said the worst thing I could think of. \"No wonder you lose all your babies.\" I spun on my heel and marched out of the house. I was so outraged I couldn\u0027t even get in the car. It was really unfortunate that Calvin pulled up behind me and leaped from his truck almost before it stopped.\n \"My God, what\u0027s wrong?\" he said. \"Is Crystal okay?\"\n \"Why don\u0027t you ask her that?\" I said nastily, and climbed into my car only to sit there shaking. Calvin ran into the house as if he had to put out a fire, and I guess that was about the size of it.\n \"Jason, dammit,\" I yelled, thumping my fist on my steering wheel. I should have taken the time to listen to Jason\u0027s brain. He\u0027d known good and well that since he had business in Clarice, Dove and Crystal would probably take the opportunity to have a tryst. He\u0027d planned on me being dutiful and dropping by. It was just too big a coincidence that Calvin had shown up. He must have also told Calvin to check on Crystal. So there was no deniability, and no chance of hushing this up - not since Calvin and I both knew. I had been right to worry about the terms of the marriage, and now I had something entirely new to worry about.\n Plus, I was ashamed. I was ashamed of the behavior of everyone involved. In my code of conduct, which doesn\u0027t really make me a very good Christian at all, what single people do in caring relationships is their own business. Even in a more casual relationship - well, if the people respect one another, okay. But a couple who\u0027s promised to be faithful, who\u0027s pledged that publicly, are governed by a whole different set of rules, in my world.\n Not in Crystal\u0027s world, or Dove\u0027s world, apparently.\n Calvin came back down the steps looking years older than he had when he\u0027d bounded up them. He stopped by my car. He wore an expression twin to mine - disillusion, disappointment, disgust. Lots of dises there.\n \"I\u0027ll be in touch,\" he said. \"We got to have the ceremony now.\"\n Crystal came out on the porch wrapped in a leopard-print bathrobe, and rather than endure her speaking to me I started the car and left as quickly as I could. I drove home in a daze. When I came in the back door, Amelia was chopping up something on the old cutting board, the one that had survived the fire with only scorch marks. She turned to speak to me and had opened her mouth when she saw my face. I shook my head at her, warning her not to talk, and I went straight into my room.\n This would have been a good day for me to be living by myself again.\n I sat in my room in the little chair in the corner, the one that had seated so many visitors lately. Bob was curled up in a ball on my bed, a place he was expressly forbidden to sleep. Someone had opened my door during the day. I thought about chewing Amelia out about that, then discarded the idea when I saw a pile of clean and folded underwear lying on top of my dresser.\n \"Bob,\" I said, and the cat unfolded and leaped to his feet in one fluid movement. He stood on my bed, staring at me with wide golden eyes. \"Get the hell out of here,\" I said. With immense dignity Bob leaped down from the bed and stalked to the door. I opened it a few inches and he went out, managing to leave the impression that he was doing this of his own free will. I shut the door behind him.\n I love cats. I just wanted to be by myself.\n The phone rang, and I stood up to answer it.\n \"Tomorrow night,\" Calvin said. \"Wear something comfortable. Seven o\u0027clock.\" He sounded sad and tired.\n \"Okay,\" I said, and we both hung up. I sat there a while longer. Whatever this ceremony consisted of, did I have to be a participant? Yeah, I did. Unlike Crystal, I kept my promises. I\u0027d had to stand up for Jason at his wedding, as his closest relative, as a surrogate to take his punishment if he was unfaithful to his new wife. Calvin had stood up for Crystal. And now look what we\u0027d come to.\n I didn\u0027t know what was going to happen, but I knew it was going to be awful. Though the werepanthers understood the necessity for breeding each available pure male panther to each available pure female panther (the only way to produce purebred baby panthers), they also believed once the breeding had been given a chance, any partnerships formed should be monogamous. If you didn\u0027t want to take that vow, you didn\u0027t form a partnership or marry. This was the way they ran their community. Crystal would have absorbed these rules from birth, and Jason had learned them from Calvin before the wedding.\n Jason didn\u0027t call, and I was glad. I wondered what was happening at his house, but only in a dull kind of way. When had Crystal met Dove Beck? Did Dove\u0027s wife know about this? I wasn\u0027t surprised that Crystal had cheated on Jason, but I was a little astonished at her choice.\n I decided that Crystal had wanted to make her betrayal as emphatic as it could possibly be. She was saying, \"I\u0027ll have sex with someone else while I\u0027m carrying your child. And he\u0027ll be older than you, and a different race from you, and he\u0027ll even work for you!\" Twisting the knife in deeper with every layer. If this was retaliation for the damn cheeseburger, I\u0027d say she\u0027d gotten a steak-size vengeance.\n Because I didn\u0027t want to seem like I was sulking, I came out for supper, which was lowly and comforting tuna noodle casserole with peas and onions. After stacking the dishes for Octavia to take care of, I retreated back to my room. The two witches were practically tiptoeing up and down the hall because they were so anxious not to disturb me, though of course they were dying to ask me what the problem was.\n But they didn\u0027t; God bless them. I really couldn\u0027t have explained. I was too mortified.\n I said about a million prayers before I went to sleep that night, but none of them ended up making me feel any better.\n I went to work the next day because I had to. Staying home wouldn\u0027t have made me feel any better. I was profoundly glad Jason didn\u0027t come into Merlotte\u0027s, because I would have thrown a mug at him if he had.\n Sam eyed me carefully several times and finally he drew me behind the bar with him. \"Tell me what\u0027s happening,\" he said.\n Tears flooded my eyes, and I was within an ace of making a real scene. I squatted down hastily, as if I\u0027d dropped something on the floor, and I said, \"Sam, please don\u0027t ask me. I\u0027m too upset to talk about it.\" Suddenly, I realized it would be a big comfort to tell Sam, but I just couldn\u0027t, not in the crowded bar.\n \"Hey, you know I\u0027m here if you need me.\" His face was serious. He patted my shoulder.\n I was so lucky to have him for a boss.\n His gesture reminded me that I had lots of friends who would not dishonor themselves as Crystal had done. Jason had dishonored himself, too, by forcing Calvin and me to witness her cheap betrayal. I had so many friends who would not do such a thing! It was a trick of fate that the one who would was my own brother.\n This thought made me feel better and stronger.\n I actually had a backbone by the time I got home. No one else was there. I hesitated, wondering whether I could call Tara or beg Sam to take an hour off, or even call Bill to go with me to Hotshot... but that was just weakness talking. This was something I had to do by myself. Calvin had warned me to wear something comfortable and not to dress up, and my Merlotte\u0027s outfit was certainly both those things. But it seemed wrong to wear my work clothes to an event like this. There might be blood. I didn\u0027t know what to anticipate. I pulled on yoga pants and an old gray sweatshirt. I made sure my hair was pulled back. I looked like I was dressed to clean out my closets.\n On the drive to Hotshot, I turned up the radio and sang at the top of my lungs to keep myself from thinking. I harmonized with Evanescence and agreed with the Dixie Chicks that I wasn\u0027t going to back down... a good spine-stiffening song to listen to.\n I reached Hotshot well before seven. I\u0027d last been out here at Jason and Crystal\u0027s wedding, where I\u0027d danced with Quinn. That visit of Quinn\u0027s had been the only time he and I had been intimate. In hindsight, I regretted having taken that step. It had been a mistake. I\u0027d been banking on a future that never came to pass. I\u0027d jumped the gun. I hoped I\u0027d never make that mistake again.\n I parked, as I had the night of Jason\u0027s wedding, by the side of the road. There weren\u0027t nearly as many cars here tonight as there had been then, when many plain human people had been guests. But there were a few extra vehicles. I recognized Jason\u0027s truck. The others belonged to the few werepanthers who didn\u0027t live in Hotshot.\n A little crowd had already assembled in the backyard of Calvin\u0027s house. People made way for me until I\u0027d gotten to the center of the gathering and found Crystal, Jason, and Calvin. I saw some familiar faces. A middle-aged panther named Maryelizabeth nodded to me. I saw her daughter nearby. The girl, whose name I couldn\u0027t remember, was by no means the only underage observer. I got that creepy feeling that raised the hairs on my arms, the way I did every time I tried to picture everyday life in Hotshot.\n Calvin was staring down at his boots, and he didn\u0027t look up. Jason didn\u0027t meet my eyes, either. Only Crystal was upright and defiant, her dark eyes catching mine, daring me to stare her down. I did dare, and after a moment she dropped her gaze to somewhere in the middle distance.\n Maryelizabeth had a tattered old book in her hand, and she opened it to a page she\u0027d marked with a torn piece of newspaper. The community seemed to still and settle. This was the purpose for which they\u0027d assembled.\n \"We people of the fang and claw are here because one of us broke her vows,\" Maryelizabeth read. \"At the marriage of Crystal and Jason, werepanthers of this community, they each promised to remain true to their marriage vows, both in the way of the cat and the way of the human. Crystal\u0027s surrogate was her uncle Calvin, and Jason\u0027s was his sister, Sookie.\"\n I was aware of the eyes of all the assembled community moving from Calvin to me. A lot of those eyes were golden yellow. Inbreeding in Hotshot had produced some slightly alarming results.\n \"Now that Crystal has broken her vows, a fact witnessed by the surrogates, her uncle has offered to take the punishment since Crystal is pregnant.\"\n This was going to be even nastier than I\u0027d suspected.\n \"Since Calvin takes Crystal\u0027s place, Sookie, do you choose to take Jason\u0027s place?\"\n Oh, crap. I looked at Calvin and I knew my whole face was asking him if there was any way out of this. And his whole face told me no. He actually looked sorry for me.\n I would never forgive my brother - or Crystal - for this.\n \"Sookie,\" Maryelizabeth prompted.\n \"What would I have to do?\" I said, and if I sounded sullen and grudging and angry, I thought I had a good reason.\n Maryelizabeth opened the book again and read the answer. \"We exist by our wits and our claws, and if faith is broken, a claw is broken,\" she said.\n I stared at her, trying to make sense of that.\n \"Either you or Jason has to break Calvin\u0027s finger,\" she said simply. \"In fact, since Crystal broke the faith completely, you have to break two, at least. More would be better. Jason gets to pick, I guess.\"\n More would be better. Jesus Christ, Shepherd of Judea. I tried to be dispassionate. Who could cause the most damage to my friend Calvin? My brother, no doubt about it. If I was a true friend to Calvin, I would do this. Could I bring myself to? And then it was taken out of my hands.\n Jason said, \"I didn\u0027t think it would happen this way, Sookie.\" He sounded simultaneously angry, confused, and defensive. \"If Calvin stands in for Crystal, I want Sookie to stand in for me,\" he told Maryelizabeth. I never thought I could hate my own brother, but at that moment I found out it was possible.\n \"So be it,\" said Maryelizabeth.\n I tried to boost myself up mentally. After all, this wasn\u0027t maybe quite as bad as I\u0027d anticipated. I\u0027d pictured Calvin being whipped or having to whip Crystal. Or we might have had to do some awful thing involving knives; that would have been way worse.\n I tried to believe this might not be so bad right up until the time two of the males carried out a pair of concrete blocks and put them on top of the picnic table.\n And then Maryelizabeth produced a brick. She held it out to me.\n I began to shake my head involuntarily because I felt a heavy twinge in my stomach. Nausea did flip-flops in my belly. Looking at the common red brick, I began to have an idea what this was going to cost me.\n Calvin stepped forward and took my hand. He leaned over to talk very close to my ear. \"Darlin\u0027,\" he said, \"you have to do this. I accepted this, when I stood up for her when she married. And I knew what she was. And you know Jason. This might easily have been the other way \u0027round. I might be about to do this to you. And you don\u0027t heal as well. This is better. And it has to be. Our people require this.\" He straightened and looked me right in the eyes. His own were golden, utterly strange, and quite steady.\n I pinched my lips together, and I made myself nod. Calvin gave me a bracing look and took his place by the table. He put his hand on the concrete blocks. With no further ado, Maryelizabeth handed me the brick. The rest of the panthers waited patiently for me to perform the punishment. The vampires would have dressed this all up with a special wardrobe and probably an extraspecial fancy brick from an old temple or something, but not the panthers. It was just a damn brick. I held it with both hands gripping one long side.\n After I\u0027d looked at it for a long minute, I said to Jason. \"I don\u0027t want to talk to you again. Ever.\" I faced Crystal. \"I hope you enjoyed it, bitch,\" I said, and I turned as quick as I could and brought the brick down on Calvin\u0027s hand. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/from-dead-to-worse-sookie-stackhouse-8/page-18.html","bookId":2198,"book":{"id":2198,"title":"From Dead to Worse (Sookie Stackhouse #8)","description":"Storyline: \n From Dead to Worse (Sookie Stackhouse #8) \n After the natural disaster of Hurricane Katrina and the manmade explosion at the vampire summit, everyone human and otherwise is stressed, including Louisiana cocktail waitress Sookie Stackhouse, who is trying to cope with the fact that her boyfriend Quinn has gone missing. \n It\u0027s clear that things are changing whether the weres and vamps of her corner of Louisiana like it or not.
