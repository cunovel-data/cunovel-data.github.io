A QUIET LITTLE DINNER.","content":"Sir Henry Harcourt was married and took his bride to Paris and Nice; and Sir Lionel Bertram tried to get married, but his bride—bride as he hoped her to have been—ran away by herself to Hadley. In the meantime George Bertram lived alone in his dark dull chambers in London. \n \n He would fain have been all alone; but at what was perhaps the worst moment of his misery, his father came to him. It may be remembered how anxiously he had longed to know his father when he first commenced that journey to Jerusalem, how soon he became attached to him, how fascinated he had been by Sir Lionel\u0027s manners, how easily he forgave the first little traits of un-paternal conduct on his father\u0027s part, how gradually the truth forced itself upon his mind. But now, at this time, the truth had forced itself on his mind. He knew his father for what he was. \n \n And his mind was not one which could reject such knowledge, or alter the nature of it because the man was his father. There are those to whom a father\u0027s sins, or a husband\u0027s sins, or a brother\u0027s sins are no sins at all. And of such one may say, that though we must of compulsion find their judgment to be in some sort delinquent, that their hearts more than make up for such delinquency. One knows that they are wrong, but can hardly wish them to be less so. \n \n But George Bertram was not one of them: he had been in no hurry to condemn his father; but, having seen his sins, he knew them for sins, and did condemn them. He found that his uncle had been right, and that Sir Lionel was a man whom he could in no wise respect, and could hardly love. Money he perceived was his father\u0027s desire. He would therefore give him what money he could spare; but he would not give him his society. \n \n When, therefore, Sir Lionel announced his arrival in town and his intention to remain there some little time, George Bertram was by no means solaced in his misery. In those days he was very miserable. It was only now that he knew how thoroughly he loved this woman—now that she was so utterly beyond his reach. Weak and wavering as he was in many things, he was not weak enough to abandon himself altogether to unavailing sorrow. He knew that work alone could preserve him from sinking—hard, constant, unflinching work, that one great cure for all our sorrow, that only means of adapting ourselves to God\u0027s providences. \n \n So he set himself to work—not a lazy, listless reading of counted pages; not history at two volumes a week, or science at a treatise a day; but to such true work as he found it in him to do, working with all his mind and all his strength. He had already written and was known as a writer; but he had written under impulse, carelessly, without due regard to his words or due thought as to his conclusions. He had written things of which he was already ashamed, and had put forth with the ex cathedra air of an established master ideas which had already ceased to be his own. But all that should be altered now. Then he had wanted a quick return for his writing. It had piqued him to think that the names of others, his contemporaries, were bruited about the world, but that the world knew nothing of his own. Harcourt was already a noted man, while he himself had done no more than attempted and abandoned a profession. Harcourt\u0027s early success had made him an early author; but he already felt that his authorship was unavailing. Harcourt\u0027s success had been solid, stable, such as men delight in; his had as yet resulted only in his all but forced withdrawal from the only respectable position which he had achieved. \n \n And now Harcourt\u0027s success was again before him. Harcourt had now as his own that which he had looked to as the goal of all his success, the worldly reward for which he had been willing to work. And yet what was Harcourt as compared with him? He knew himself to be of a higher temperament, of a brighter genius, of greater powers. He would not condescend even to compare himself to this man who had so thoroughly distanced him in the world\u0027s race. \n \n Thinking, and feeling, and suffering thus, he had begun to work with all the vehemence of which he was master. He would ask for no speedy return now. His first object was to deaden the present misery of his mind; and then, if it might be so, to vindicate his claim to be regarded as one of England\u0027s worthy children, letting such vindication come in its own time. \n \n Such being the state of his mind, his father\u0027s arrival did not contribute much to his comfort. Sir Lionel was rather petulant when he was with him; objected to him that he had played his cards badly; would talk about Caroline, and, which was almost worse, about the solicitor-general; constantly urged him to make overtures of reconciliation to his uncle; and wanted one day five pounds, on another ten pounds, and again on a third fifteen pounds. At this moment George\u0027s fixed income was but two hundred pounds a year, and any other wealth of which he was possessed was the remainder of his uncle\u0027s thousand pounds. When that was gone, he must either live on his income, small as it was, or write for the booksellers. Such being the case, he felt himself obliged to decline when the fifteen pounds was mentioned. \n \n \"You can let me have it for a couple of months?\" said Sir Lionel. \n \n \"Not conveniently,\" said his son. \n \n \"I will send it you back immediately on my return to Littlebath,\" said the father; \"so if you have got it by you, pray oblige me.\" \n \n \"I certainly have got it,\" said the son—and he handed him the desired check; \"but I think you should remember, sir, how very small my income is, and that there is no prospect of its being increased.\" \n \n \"It must be altogether your own fault then,\" said the colonel, pocketing the money. \"I never knew a young man who had a finer hand of cards put into his hand—never; if you have played it badly, it is your own fault, altogether your own fault.\" In truth, Sir Lionel did really feel that his son had used him badly, and owed him some amends. Had George but done his duty, he might now have been the actual recognized heir of his uncle\u0027s wealth, and the actual possessor of as much as would have been allowed to a dutiful, obedient son. To a man of Sir Lionel\u0027s temperament, it was annoying that there should be so much wealth so near him, and yet absolutely, and, alas! probably for ever out of his reach. \n \n Sir Lionel had resolved to wait in London for his answer, and there he received it. Short as was poor Miss Baker\u0027s letter, it was quite sufficiently explicit. She had betrayed him to the old gentleman, and after that all hopes of money from that source were over. It might still be possible for him to talk over Miss Baker, but such triumph would be but barren. Miss Baker with a transferred allegiance—transferred from the old gentleman to him—would be but a very indifferent helpmate. He learnt, however, from Littlebath that she was still away, and would probably not return. Then he went back in fancied security, and found himself the centre of all those amatory ovations which Miss Todd and Miss Gauntlet had prepared for him. \n \n It was about two months after this that George Bertram saw Sir Henry Harcourt for the first time after the marriage. He had heard that Sir Henry was in town, had heard of the blaze of their new house in Eaton Square, had seen in the papers how magnificently Lady Harcourt had appeared at court, how well she graced her brilliant home, how fortunate the world esteemed that young lawyer who, having genius, industry, and position of his own, had now taken to himself in marriage beauty, wealth, and social charms. All this George Bertram heard and read, and hearing it and reading it had kept himself from the paths in which such petted children of fortune might probably be met. \n \n Twice in the course of these two months did Sir Henry call at Bertram\u0027s chambers; but Bertram was now at home to no one. He lived in a great desert, in which was no living being but himself—in a huge desert without water and without grass, in which there was no green thing. He was alone; to one person only had he spoken of his misery; once only had he thought of escaping from it. That thought had been in vain: that companion was beyond his reach; and, therefore, living there in his London chambers, he had been all alone. \n \n But at last they did meet. Sir Henry, determined not to be beaten in his attempt to effect a reconciliation, wrote to him, saying that he would call, and naming an hour. \"Caroline and you,\" he said, \"are cousins; there can be no reason why you should be enemies. For her sake, if not for mine, do oblige me in this.\" \n \n Bertram sat for hours with that note beneath his eyes before he could bring himself to answer it. Could it really be that she desired to see him again? That she, in her splendour and first glow of prosperous joy, would wish to encounter him in his dreary, sad, deserted misery? And why could she wish it? and, ah! how could she wish it? \n \n And then he asked himself whether he also would wish to see her. That he still loved her, loved her as he never had done while she was yet his own, he had often told himself. That he could never be at rest till he had ceased to make her the first object of his thoughts he had said as often. That he ought not to see her, he knew full well. The controversy within his own bosom was carried on for two hours, and then he wrote to Sir Henry, saying that he would be at his chambers at the hour named. From that moment the salutary effort was discontinued, the work was put aside, and the good that had been done was all revoked. \n \n Sir Henry came, true to his appointment. Whatever might be his object, he was energetic in it. He was now a man of many concernments; hours were scanty with him, and a day much too short. The calls of clients, and the calls of party, joined to those other calls which society makes upon men in such brilliant stations, hardly left him time for sleeping; but not the less urgent was he in his resolve to see his beaten rival who would so willingly have left him to his brilliant joy. But was not all this explained long even before Christianity was in vogue? \"Quos Deus vult perdere, prius dementat.\" Whom God will confound, those he first maddens. \n \n Nothing could exceed the bland friendship, the winning manners, and the frank courtesy of Sir Henry. He said but little about what was past; but that little went to show that he had been blessed with the hand of Caroline Waddington only because Bertram had rejected that blessing as not worthy his acceptance. Great man as he was, he almost humbled himself before Bertram\u0027s talent. He spoke of their mutual connection at Hadley as though they two were his heirs of right, and as though their rights were equal; and then he ended by begging that they might still be friends. \n \n \"Our careers must be widely different,\" said Bertram, somewhat touched by his tone; \"yours will be in the light; mine must be in the dark.\" \n \n \"Most men who do any good live in the dark for some period of their lives,\" said Harcourt. \"I, too, have had my dark days, and doubtless shall have them again; but neither with you nor with me will they endure long.\" \n \n Bertram thought that Harcourt knew nothing about it, and sneered when the successful man talked of his dark days. What darkness had his mental eyesight ever known? We are all apt to think when our days are dark that there is no darkness so dark as our own. \n \n \"I know what your feelings are,\" continued Sir Henry; \"and I hope you will forgive me if I speak openly. You have resolved not to meet Caroline. My object is to make you put aside that resolve. It is my object and hers also. It is out of the question that you should continue to avoid the world. Your walk in life will be that of a literary man: but nowadays literary men become senators and statesmen. They have high rank, are well paid, and hold their own boldly against men of meaner capacities. This is the career that we both foresee for you; and in that career we both hope to be your friends.\" \n \n So spoke the great advocate with suasive eloquence—with eloquence dangerously suasive as regarded his own happiness. But in truth this man knew not what love meant—not that love which those two wretched lovers understood so well. That his own wife was cold to him, cold as ice—that he well knew. That Bertram had flung her from him because she had been cold to him—that he believed. That he himself could live without any passionate love—that he acknowledged. His wife was graceful and very beautiful—all the world confessed that. And thus Sir Henry was contented. Those honeymoon days had indeed been rather dreary. Once or twice before that labour was over he had been almost tempted to tell her that he had paid too high for the privilege of pressing such an icicle to his bosom. But he had restrained himself; and now in the blaze of the London season, passing his mornings in courts of law and his evenings in the House of Parliament, he flattered himself that he was a happy man. \n \n \"Come and dine with us in a quiet way the day after to-morrow,\" said Sir Henry, \"and then the ice will be broken.\" George Bertram said that he would; and from that moment his studies were at an end. \n \n This occurred on the Monday. The invitation was for the following Wednesday. Sir Henry explained that from some special cause he would be relieved from parliamentary attendance, at any rate till ten o\u0027clock; that at the quiet dinner there would be no other guests except Mr. and Mrs. Stistick, and Baron Brawl, whose wife and family were not yet in town. \n \n \"You\u0027ll like the baron,\" said Harcourt; \"he\u0027s loud and arrogant, no doubt; but he\u0027s not loud and arrogant about nothing, as some men are. Stistick is a bore. Of course you know him. He\u0027s member for Peterloo, and goes with us on condition that somebody listens to him about once a week. But the baron will put him down.\" \n \n \"And Mrs. Stistick?\" said George. \n \n \"I never heard of her till yesterday, and Caroline has gone to call on her to-day. It\u0027s rather a bore for her, for they live somewhere half-way to Harrow, I believe. Half-past seven. Good-bye, old fellow. I ought to have been before Baron Brawl at Westminster twenty minutes since.\" And so the solicitor-general, rushing out from the Temple, threw himself into a cab; and as the wheels rattled along the Strand, he made himself acquainted with the contents of his brief. \n \n Why should Caroline have expressed a wish to see him? That was the thought that chiefly rested in Bertram\u0027s mind when Sir Henry left him. Why should it be an object to her to force a meeting between her and him? Would it not be better for them both that they should be far as the poles asunder? \n \n \"Well,\" he said to himself, \"if it be no difficulty to her, neither shall it be a difficulty to me. She is strong-minded, and I will be so no less. I will go and meet her. It is but the first plunge that gives the shock.\" \n \n And thus he closed his work, and sat moodily thinking. He was angry with her in that she could endure to see him; but, alas! half-pleased also that she should wish to do so. He had no thought, no most distant thought, that she could ever now be more to him than the wife of an acquaintance whom he did not love too well. But yet there was in his heart some fragment of half-satisfied vanity at hearing that she did look forward to see him once again. \n \n And how shall we speak of such a wish on her part? \"Caroline,\" her husband had said to her at breakfast, \"it will be all nonsense for you and George Bertram to keep up any kind of quarrel. I hate nonsense of that sort.\" \n \n \"There is no quarrel between us,\" she replied. \n \n \"There ought to be none; and I shall get him to come here.\" \n \n The colour of her face became slightly heightened as she answered: \"If you wish it, Sir Henry, and he wishes it also, I shall not object.\" \n \n \"I do wish it, certainly. I think it absolutely necessary as regards my position with your grandfather.\" \n \n \"Do just as you think best,\" said his wife. \u0027Twas thus that Lady Harcourt had expressed her desire to see George Bertram at her house. Had he known the truth, that fragment of half-satisfied vanity would have been but small. \n \n In those early days of her marriage, Lady Harcourt bore her triumphs very placidly. She showed no great elation at the change that had come over her life. Her aunt from Hadley was frequently with her, and wondered to find her so little altered, or rather, in some respects, so much altered; for she was more considerate in her manner, more sparing of her speech, much less inclined to domineer now, as Lady Harcourt, than in former days she had ever been as Caroline Waddington. She went constantly into society, and was always much considered; but her triumphs were mainly of that quiet nature which one sometimes sees to be achieved with so little effort by beautiful women. It seemed but necessary that she should sit still, and sometimes smile, and the world was ready to throw itself at her feet. Nay, the smile was but too often omitted, and yet the world was there. \n \n At home, though more employed, she was hardly more energetic. Her husband told her that he wished his house to be noted for the pleasantness of his dinner-parties, and, therefore, she studied the subject as a good child would study a lesson. She taught herself what the material of a dinner should be, she satisfied herself that her cook was good, she looked to the brilliancy of her appointments, and did her best to make the house shine brightly. The house did shine, and on the whole Sir Henry was contented. It was true that his wife did not talk much; but what little she did say was said with a sweet manner and with perfect grace. She was always dressed with care, was always beautiful, was always ladylike. Had not Sir Henry reason to be contented? As for talking, he could do that himself. \n \n And now that she was told that George Bertram was to come to her house, she did not show much more excitement at the tidings than at the promised advent of Mr. Baron Brawl. She took the matter with such indifference that Sir Henry, at least, had no cause for jealousy. But then she was indifferent about everything. Nothing seemed to wake her either to joy or sorrow. Sir Henry, perhaps, was contented; but lovely, ladylike, attractive as she was, he sometimes did feel almost curious to know whether it were possible to rouse this doll of his to any sense of life or animation. He had thought, nay, almost wished, that the name of her old lover would have moved her, that the idea of seeing him would have disturbed her. But, no; one name was the same to her as another. She had been told to go and call on Mrs. Stistick, and she had gone. She was told to receive Mr. Bertram, and she was quite ready to do so. Angels from heaven, or spirits from below, could Sir Henry have summoned such to his table, would have been received by her with equal equanimity. This was dutiful on her part, and naturally satisfactory to a husband inclined to be somewhat exigeant. But even duty may pall on an exigeant husband, and a man may be brought to wish that his wife would cross him. \n \n But on this occasion Sir Henry had no such pleasure. \"I saw Bertram this morning,\" he said, when he went home for five minutes before taking his seat in the House for the night. \"He\u0027s to be here on Wednesday.\" \n \n \"Oh, very well. There will be six, then.\" She said no more. It was clear that the dinner, and that only, was on her mind. He had told her to be careful about his dinners, and therefore could not complain. But, nevertheless, he was almost vexed. Don\u0027t let any wife think that she will satisfy her husband by perfect obedience. Overmuch virtue in one\u0027s neighbours is never satisfactory to us sinners. \n \n But there were moments in which Lady Harcourt could think of her present life, when no eye was by to watch her—no master there to wonder at her perfections. Moments! nay, but there were hours, and hours, and hours. There were crowds of hours; slow, dull, lingering hours, in which she had no choice but to think of it. A woman may see to her husband\u0027s dinners and her own toilet, and yet have too much time for thinking. It would almost have been a comfort to Lady Harcourt if Sir Henry could have had a dinner-party every day. \n \n How should she bear herself; what should she say; how should she look when George Bertram came there as a guest to her house? How could he be so cruel, so heartless, so inhuman as to come there? Her path was difficult enough for her poor weary feet. He must know that—should, at any rate, have known it. How could he be so cruel as to add this great stumbling-block to her other perils? \n \n The Wednesday came, and at half-past seven she was in her drawing-room as beautiful and as dignified as ever. She had a peculiar place of her own in the corner of a peculiar sofa, and there she lived. It was her goddess\u0027 shrine, and her worshippers came and did reverence before her. None came and sat beside her. Hers was not that gentle fascination which entices men, and women too, to a near proximity. Her bow was very gracious, and said much; but \"noli me tangere\" was part of its eloquence. And so Baron Brawl found, when on entering her drawing-room he told her that the fame of her charms had reached his ears, and that he was delighted to have an opportunity of making her acquaintance. \n \n Mr. and Mrs. Stistick were the next comers. Mrs. Stistick sat herself down on an opposite sofa, and seemed to think that she did her duty to society by sitting there. And so she did. Only permit her so to sit, and there was no further labour in entertaining Mrs. Stistick. She was a large, heavy woman, with a square forehead and a square chin, and she had brought up seven children most successfully. Now, in these days of her husband\u0027s parliamentary prosperity, she was carried about to dinners; and in her way she enjoyed them. She was not too shy to eat, and had no wish whatever either to be talked to or to talk. To sit easily on a sofa and listen to the buzz of voices was life and society to her. Perhaps in those long hours she was meditating on her children\u0027s frocks or her husband\u0027s linen. But they never seemed to be long to her. \n \n Mr. Stistick was standing on the rug before the fire, preparing for his first onslaught on Baron Brawl, when the servant announced Mr. Bertram. \n \n \"Ah! Bertram, I\u0027m delighted to see you,\" said Sir Henry;—\"doubly so, as dinner is ready. Judge, you know my friend Bertram, by name, at any rate?\" and some sort of half-introduction was performed. \n \n \"He who moved all Oxford from its propriety?\" said the baron. But Bertram neither saw him nor heard him. Neither his eyes nor his ears were at his command. \n \n As he took his host\u0027s proffered hand, he glanced his eyes for a moment round the room. There she sat, and he had to speak to her as best he might. At his last interview with her he had spoken freely enough, and it all rushed now upon his mind. Then how little he had made of her, how lightly he had esteemed her! Now, as she sat there before him his spirit acknowledged her as a goddess, and he all but feared to address her. His face, he knew, was hot and red; his manner, he felt, was awkward. He was not master of himself, and when such is the case with a man, the fact always betrays itself. \n \n But he did speak to her. \"How do you do, Lady Harcourt?\" he said, and he put his hand out, and he felt the ends of her fingers once more within his own. \n \n And she spoke too, probably. But pretty women can say almost as much as is necessary on such occasions as this without opening their lips. Whether she spoke, or whether she did not, it was the same to him. He certainly did not hear her. But her fingers did touch his hand, her eyes did rest upon his face; and then, in that moment of time, he thought of Jerusalem, of the Mount of Olives, of those rides at Littlebath, and of that last meeting, when all, all had been shattered to pieces. \n \n \"There are five hundred and fifty-five thousand male children between the ages of nine and twelve,\" said Mr. Stistick, pursuing some wondrous line of argument, as Bertram turned himself towards the fire. \n \n \"What a fine national family!\" said the baron. \"And how ashamed I feel when I bethink myself that only one of them is mine!\" \n \n \"Dinner is served,\" said the butler. \n \n \"Mrs. Stistick, will you allow me?\" said Sir Henry. And then in half a minute Bertram found himself walking down to dinner with the member of Parliament. \"And we have school accommodation for just one hundred and fourteen,\" continued that gentleman on the stairs. \"Now, will you tell me what becomes of the other four hundred and forty-one?\" \n \n Bertram was not at that moment in a condition to give him any information on the subject. \n \n \"I can tell you about the one,\" said the baron, as Sir Henry began his grace. \n \n \"An odd thousand is nothing,\" said Mr. Stistick, pausing for a second till the grace was over. \n \n The judge and Mr. Stistick sat at Lady Harcourt\u0027s right and left, so that Bertram was not called upon to say much to her during dinner. The judge talked incessantly, and so did the member of Parliament, and so also did the solicitor-general. A party of six is always a talking party. Men and women are not formed into pairs, and do not therefore become dumb. Each person\u0027s voice makes another person emulous, and the difficulty felt is not as to what one shall say, but how one shall get it in. Ten, and twelve, and fourteen are the silent numbers. \n \n Every now and again Harcourt endeavoured to make Bertram join in the conversation; and Bertram did make some faint attempts. He essayed to answer some of Mr. Stistick\u0027s very difficult inquiries, and was even roused to parry some raillery from the judge. But he was not himself; and Caroline, who could not but watch him narrowly as she sat there in her silent beauty, saw that he was not so. She arraigned him in her mind for want of courage; but had he been happy, and noisy, and light of heart, she would probably have arraigned him for some deeper sin. \n \n \"As long as the matter is left in the hands of the parents, nothing on earth will be done,\" said Mr. Stistick. \n \n \"That\u0027s what I have always said to Lady Brawl,\" said the judge. \n \n \"And it\u0027s what I have said to Lord John; and what I intend to say to him again. Lord John is all very well—\" \n \n \"Thank you, Stistick. I am glad, at any rate, to get as much as that from you,\" said the solicitor. \n \n \"Lord John is all very well,\" continued the member, not altogether liking the interruption; \"but there is only one man in the country who thoroughly understands the subject, and who is able—\" \n \n \"And I don\u0027t see the slightest probability of finding a second,\" said the judge. \n \n \"And who is able to make himself heard.\" \n \n \"What do you say, Lady Harcourt,\" asked the baron, \"as to the management of a school with—how many millions of them, Mr. Stistick?\" \n \n \"Five hundred and fifty-five thousand male children—\" \n \n \"Suppose we say boys,\" said the judge. \n \n \"Boys?\" asked Mr. Stistick, not quite understanding him, but rather disconcerted by the familiarity of the word. \n \n \"Well, I suppose they must be boys;—at least the most of them.\" \n \n \"They are all from nine to twelve, I say,\" continued Mr. Stistick, completely bewildered. \n \n \"Oh, that alters the question,\" said the judge. \n \n \"Not at all,\" said Mr. Stistick. \"There is accommodation for only—\" \n \n \"Well, we\u0027ll ask Lady Harcourt. What do you say, Lady Harcourt?\" \n \n Lady Harcourt felt herself by no means inclined to enter into the joke on either side; so she said, with her gravest smile, \"I\u0027m sure Mr. Stistick understands very well what he\u0027s talking about.\" \n \n \"What do you say, ma\u0027am?\" said the judge, turning round to the lady on his left. \n \n \"Mr. Stistick is always right on such matters,\" said the lady. \n \n \"See what it is to have a character. It absolutely enables one to upset the laws of human nature. But still I do say, Mr. Solicitor, that the majority of them were probably boys.\" \n \n \"Boys!\" exclaimed the member of Parliament. \"Boys! I don\u0027t think you can have understood a word that we have been saying.\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t think I have,\" said the baron. \n \n \"There are five hundred and fifty-five thousand male children between—\" \n \n \"Oh—h—h! male children! Ah—h—h! Now I see the difference; I beg your pardon, Mr. Stistick, but I really was very stupid. And you mean to explain all this to Lord John in the present session?\" \n \n \"But, Stistick, who is the one man?\" said Sir Henry. \n \n \"The one man is Lord Boanerges. He, I believe, is the only man living who really understands the social wants of this kingdom.\" \n \n \"And everything else also,\" sneered the baron. The baron always sneered at cleverness that was external to his own profession, especially when exhibited by one who, like the noble lord named, should have confined his efforts to that profession. \n \n \"So Boanerges is to take in hand these male children? And very fitting, too; he was made to be a schoolmaster.\" \n \n \"He is the first man of the age; don\u0027t you think so, Sir Henry?\" \n \n \"He was, certainly, when he was on the woolsack,\" said Sir Henry. \"That is the normal position always assumed by the first man of his age in this country.\" \n \n \"Though some of them when there do hide their lights under a bushel,\" said the judge. \n \n \"He is the first law reformer that perhaps ever lived,\" said Mr. Stistick, enthusiastically. \n \n \"And I hope will be the last in my time,\" said his enemy. \n \n \"I hope he will live to complete his work,\" said the politician. \n \n \"Then Methuselah will be a child to him, and Jared and Lamech little babies,\" said the judge. \n \n \"In such case he has got his work before him, certainly,\" said Mr. Solicitor. \n \n And so the battle was kept up between them, and George Bertram and Lady Harcourt sat by and listened; or more probably, perhaps, sat by and did not listen. \n \n But when her ladyship and Mrs. Stistick had retreated—Oh, my readers, fancy what that next hour must have been to Caroline Harcourt!—How Gothic, how barbarous are we still in our habits, in that we devote our wives to such wretchedness as that! O, lady, has it ever been your lot to sit out such hour as that with some Mrs. Stistick, who would neither talk, nor read, nor sleep; in whose company you could neither talk, nor read, nor yet sleep? And if such has been your lot, have you not asked yourself why in this civilized country, in this civilized century, you should be doomed to such a senseless, sleepless purgatory?—But when they were gone, and when the judge, radiant with fun and happiness, hastened to fill his claret beaker, then Bertram by degrees thawed, and began to feel that after all the world was perhaps not yet dead around him. \n \n \"Well, Mr. Stistick,\" said the baron; \"if Sir Henry will allow us, we\u0027ll drink Lord Boanerges.\" \n \n \"With all my heart,\" said Mr. Stistick. \"He is a man of whom it may be said—\" \n \n \"That no man knew better on which side his bread was buttered.\" \n \n \"He is buttering the bread of millions upon millions,\" said Mr. Stistick. \n \n \"Or doing better still,\" said Bertram; \"enabling them to butter their own. Lord Boanerges is probably the only public man of this day who will be greater in a hundred years than he is now.\" \n \n \"Let us at any rate hope,\" said the baron, \"that he will at that time be less truculent.\" \n \n \"I can\u0027t agree with you, Bertram,\" said Sir Henry. \"I consider we are fertile in statesmen. Do you think that Peel will be forgotten in a hundred years?\" This was said with the usual candour of a modern turncoat. For Sir Henry had now deserted Peel. \n \n \"Almost, I should hope, by that time,\" said Bertram. \"He will have a sort of a niche in history, no doubt; as has Mr. Perceval, who did so much to assist us in the war; and Lord Castlereagh, who carried the union. They also were heaven-sent ministers, whom Acheron has not as yet altogether swallowed up.\" \n \n \"And Boanerges, you think, will escape Libitina?\" \n \n \"If the spirit of the age will allow immortality to any man of these days, I think he will. But I doubt whether public opinion, as now existing, will admit of hero-worship.\" \n \n \"Public opinion is the best safeguard for a great man\u0027s great name,\" said Mr. Stistick, with intense reliance on the civilization of his own era. \n \n \"Quite true, sir; quite true,\" said the baron,—\"for the space of twenty-four hours.\" \n \n Then followed a calm, and then coffee. After that, the solicitor-general, looking at his watch, marched off impetuous to the House. \"Judge,\" he said, \"I know you will excuse me; for you, too, have been a slave in your time: but you will go up to Lady Harcourt; Bertram, you will not be forgiven if you do not go upstairs.\" \n \n Bertram did go upstairs, that he might not appear to be unmanly, as he said to himself, in slinking out of the house. He did go upstairs, for one quarter of an hour. \n \n But the baron did not. For him, it may be presumed, his club had charms. Mr. Stistick, however, did do so; he had to hand Mrs. Stistick down from that elysium which she had so exquisitely graced. He did hand her down; and then for five minutes George Bertram found himself once more alone with Caroline Waddington. \n \n \"Good-night, Lady Harcourt,\" he said, again essaying to take her hand. This and his other customary greeting was all that he had yet spoken to her. \n \n \"Good-night, Mr. Bertram.\" At last her voice faltered, at last her eye fell to the ground, at last her hand trembled. Had she stood firm through this trial all might have been well; but though she could bear herself right manfully before stranger eyes, she could not alone support his gaze; one touch of tenderness, one sign of weakness was enough—and that touch was there, that sign she gave. \n \n \"We are cousins still, are we not?\" said he. \n \n \"Yes, we are cousins—I suppose so.\" \n \n \"And as cousins we need not hate each other?\" \n \n \"Hate each other!\" and she shuddered as she spoke; \"oh, no, I hope there is no hatred!\" \n \n He stood there silent for a moment, looking, not at her, but at the costly ornaments which stood at the foot of the huge pier-glass over the fireplace. Why did he not go now? why did he stand there silent and thoughtful? why—why was he so cruel to her? \n \n \"I hope you are happy, Lady Harcourt,\" at last he said. \n \n There was almost a savage sternness in her face as she made an effort to suppress her feelings. \"Thank you—yes,\" she said; and then she added, \"I never was a believer in much happiness.\" \n \n And yet he did not go. \"We have met now,\" he said, after another pause. \n \n \"Yes, we have met now;\" and she even attempted to smile as she answered him. \n \n \"And we need not be strangers?\" Then there was again a pause; for at first she had no answer ready. \"Is it needful that we should be strangers?\" he asked. \n \n \"I suppose not; no; not if Sir Henry wishes it otherwise.\" \n \n And then he put out his hand, and wishing her good-night a second time, he went. \n \n For the next hour, Lady Harcourt sat there looking at the smouldering fire. \"Quos Deus vult perdere, prius dementat.\" Not in such language, but with some such thought, did she pass judgment on the wretched folly of her husband. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2741/75489.html","bookId":1380,"book":{"id":1380,"title":"The Bertrams","description":"简介： This is undoubtedly the age of humanityas far, at least, as England is concerned.
