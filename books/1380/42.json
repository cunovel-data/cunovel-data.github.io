{"id":21511,"no":42,"title":"CHAPTER XII. MRS. WILKINSON\u0027S TROUBLES.","content":"Arthur Wilkinson was received at home with open arms and warm embraces. He was an only son, an only brother, the head and stay of his family; and of course he was beloved. His mother wept for joy as she saw the renewed plumpness of his cheeks, and declared that Egypt must indeed be a land of fatness; and his sisters surrounded him, smiling and kissing him, and asking questions, as though he were another Livingstone. This was very delightful; but a cloud was soon to come across all this sunshine. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Wilkinson, always excepting what care she may have had for her son\u0027s ill health, had not been unhappy during his absence. She had reigned the female vicaress, without a drawback, praying daily, and in her heart almost hourly, for the continuance in the land of such excellent noblemen as Lord Stapledean. The curate who had taken Arthur\u0027s duty had been a very mild young man, and had been quite contented that Mrs. Wilkinson should leave to him the pulpit and the reading-desk. In all other matters he had been satisfied not to interfere with her power, or to contradict her edicts. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mr. Gilliflower has behaved excellently,\" she said to her son, soon after his return; \"and has quite understood my position here. I only wish we could keep him in the parish; but that, of course, is impossible.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I shouldn\u0027t want him at all, mother,\" Arthur had replied. \"I am as strong as a horse now.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"All the same; I should like to have him here,\" said Mrs. Wilkinson, in a tone which was the beginning of the battle. How sweet it would have been to her if Arthur could have gone to some good neighbouring parish, leaving her, with Gabriel Gilliflower as her assistant, to manage the souls of Hurst Staple! And why, as she almost asked herself—why should she not be addressed as the Reverend Mrs. Wilkinson? \\n\\n \\n\\n But the battle had to be fought, and there was to be an end to these sweet dreams. Her son had been meek enough, but he was not as meek as Mr. Gilliflower; and now he was sharpening his arrows, and looking to his bow, and preparing for the war. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Is Adela at Littlebath?\" he asked of one of his sisters, on the third or fourth day after his arrival. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes,\" said Mary. \"She is with her aunt. I had a letter from her yesterday.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I wonder whether she would come here if you were to ask her.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, that she would,\" said Mary. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I doubt it very much,\" said the more prudent Sophia. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Wilkinson heard the conversation, and pondered over it. At the moment she said nothing, pressing down her grief in her deep heart; but that evening, in the book-room, she found Arthur alone; and then she began. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You were not in earnest just now about Adela, were you, Arthur?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Indeed I was, mother; quite in earnest.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"She has been very much away from Littlebath since her aunt came back from Italy to make a home for her. She was with us; and with the Harcourts, in London; and, since the break-up there, she was at Hadley. It would not be right to Miss Gauntlet to ask her away so soon.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think Miss Gauntlet would mind her coming here; and even if she does—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And then my time is so much taken up—what with the schools, and what with the parish visiting—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Adela will do the visiting with you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I really had rather not have her just at present; that is, unless you have some very particular reason.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, mother, I have a particular reason. But if you had rather that she did not come here, I will go to Littlebath instead.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n There was nothing more said on this occasion; but that was the beginning of the battle. Mrs. Wilkinson could not but know what her son meant; and she now knew that all that she dreaded was to come upon her. It was not that she did not wish to see her son happy, or that she did not think that his being married and settled would tend to his happiness; but she was angry, as other mothers are angry, when their foolish, calf-like boys will go and marry without any incomes on which to support a wife. She said to herself over and over again that night, \"I cannot have a second family here in the parsonage; that\u0027s certain. And where on earth they\u0027re to live, I don\u0027t know; and how they\u0027re to live when his fellowship is gone, I can\u0027t think.\" And then she shook her head, clothed as it was in her night-cap, and reposing as it was on her pillow. \"Two thousand pounds is every shilling she has—every shilling.\" And then she shook her head again. She knew that the ecclesiastical income was her own; for had not the good Lord Stapledean given it to her? But she had sad thoughts, and feared that even on this point there might be a contest between her and her son. \\n\\n \\n\\n Two mornings after this the blow came very suddenly. It was now her habit to go into the book-room after breakfast, and set herself down to, work—as her husband, the former vicar, had done in his time—and as Arthur, since his return, usually did the same, they naturally found themselves alone together. On the morning in question, she had no sooner seated herself, with her papers before her, than Arthur began. And, alas! he had to tell her, not what he was going to do, but what he had done. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I spoke to you, mother, of going to Littlebath the other day.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, Arthur,\" said she, taking her spectacles off, and laying them beside her. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I have written to her, instead.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And you have made her an offer of marriage!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Exactly so. I was sure you must have known how my heart stood towards her. It is many years now since I first thought of this; but I was deterred, because I feared that my income—our income, that is—was insufficient.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, Arthur, and so it is. What will you do? How will you live? Adela has got just two thousand pounds—about seventy or eighty pounds a year. And your fellowship will be gone. Oh, Arthur, how will all the mouths be fed when you have six or seven children round you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027ll tell you what my plans are. If Adela should accept me—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, accept you! She\u0027ll accept you fast enough,\" said Mrs. Wilkinson, with the venom with which mothers will sometimes speak of the girls to whom their sons are attached. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It makes me very happy to hear you say so. But I don\u0027t know. When I did hint at the matter once before, I got no encouragement.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Psha!\" said Mrs. Wilkinson. \\n\\n \\n\\n This sound was music to her son\u0027s ears; so he went on with the more cheerfulness to describe his plans. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You see, mother, situated as I am, I have no right to expect any increase of income, or to hope that I shall ever be better able to marry than I am now.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But you might marry a girl who had something to help. There is Miss Glunter—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But it so happens that I am attached to Adela, and not to Miss Glunter.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Attached! But, of course, you must have your own way. You are of age, and I cannot prevent your marrying the cook-maid if you like. What I want to know is, where do you mean to live?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Here, certainly.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What! in this house?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Certainly. I am bound to live here, as the clergyman of the parish.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Mrs. Wilkinson drew herself up to her full height, put her spectacles on, and looked at the papers before her; then put them off again, and fixed her eyes on her son. \"Do you think there will be room in the house?\" she said. \"I fear you would be preparing great discomfort for Adela. Where on earth would she find room for a nursery? But, Arthur, you have not thought of these things.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Arthur, however, had thought of them very often. He knew where to find the nursery, and the room for Adela. His difficulty was as to the rooms for his mother and sisters. It was necessary now that this difference of opinion should be explained. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I suppose that my children, if I have any—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Clergymen always have large families,\" said Mrs. Wilkinson. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, I suppose they\u0027ll have the same nursery that we had.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What, and turn Sophy and Mary out of it!\" And then she paused, and began to rearrange her papers. \"That will not do at all, Arthur,\" she continued. \"It would be unjust in me to allow that; much as I think of your interests, I must of course think of theirs as well.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n How was he to tell her that the house was his own? It was essentially necessary that he should do so, and that he should do so now. If he gave up the point at the present moment, he might give it up for ever. His resolve was, that his mother and sisters should go elsewhere; but in what words could he explain this resolution to her? \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Dear mother, I think we should understand each other—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Certainly,\" said Mrs. Wilkinson, laying her hands across each other on the table, and preparing for the onslaught. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It is clearly my duty, as clergyman, to live in this parish, and to live in this house.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And it is my duty also, as was excellently explained by Lord Stapledean after your poor father\u0027s death.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My idea is this—\" and then he paused, for his heart misgave him when he attempted to tell his mother that she must pack up and turn out. His courage all but failed him. He felt that he was right, and yet he hardly knew how to explain that he was right without appearing to be unnatural. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I do not know that Lord Stapledean said anything about the house; but if he did, it could make no difference.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not the least, I should think,\" said the lady. \"When he appointed me to the income of the parish, it could hardly be necessary that he should explain that I was to have the house also.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mother, when I accepted the living, I promised him that I would give you three hundred and fifty pounds out of the proceeds; and so I will. Adela and I will be very poor, but I shall endeavour to eke out our income; that is, of course, if she consents to marry me—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Psha!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"—To eke out our income by taking pupils. To do that, I must have the house at my own disposal.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And you mean to tell me,\" said the female vicaress, rising to her feet in her wrath, \"that I—that I—am to go away?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I think it will be better, mother.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And the poor girls!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"For one or two of them there would be room here,\" said Arthur, trying to palliate the matter. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"One or two of them! Is that the way you would treat your sisters? I say nothing about myself, for I have long seen that you are tired of me. I know how jealous you are because Lord Stapledean has thought proper to—\" she could not exactly remember what phrase would best suit her purpose—\"to—to—to place me here, as he placed your poor father before. I have seen it all, Arthur. But I have my duty to do, and I shall do it. What I have undertaken in this parish I shall go through with, and if you oppose me I shall apply to his lordship.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I think you have misunderstood Lord Stapledean.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I have not misunderstood him at all. I know very well what he meant, and I quite appreciate his motives. I have endeavoured to act up to them, and shall continue to do so. I had thought that I had made the house as comfortable to you as any young man could wish.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And so you have.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And yet you want to turn me out of it—out of my own house!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not to turn you out, mother. If it suits you to remain here for another year—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It will suit me to remain here for another ten years, if I am spared so long. Little viper! I suppose this comes from her. After warming her in my bosom when her father died!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It can hardly have come from her, seeing that there has never yet been a word spoken between us on the subject. I fear that you greatly mistake the footing on which we stand together. I have no reasonable ground for hoping for a favourable answer.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Psha! viper!\" exclaimed Mrs. Wilkinson, in dire wrath. Mothers are so angry when other girls, not their own, will get offers; so doubly angry when their own sons make them. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You will make me very unhappy if you speak ill of her,\" said Arthur. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Has it ever come into your head to think where your mother and sisters are to live when you turn them out?\" said she. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Littlebath,\" suggested Arthur. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Littlebath!\" said Mrs. Wilkinson, with all the scorn that she could muster to the service. \"Littlebath! I am to put up with the aunt, I suppose, when you take the niece. But I shall not go to Littlebath at your bidding, sir.\" And so saying, she gathered up her spectacles, and stalked out of the room. \\n\\n \\n\\n Arthur was by no means satisfied with the interview, and yet had he been wise he might have been. The subject had been broached, and that in itself was a great deal. And the victory had by no means been with Mrs. Wilkinson. She had threatened, indeed, to appeal to Lord Stapledean; but that very threat showed how conscious she was that she had no power of her own to hold her place where she was. He ought to have been satisfied; but he was not so. \\n\\n \\n\\n And now he had to wait for his answer from Adela. Gentlemen who make offers by letter must have a weary time of it, waiting for the return of post, or for the return of two posts, as was the case in this instance. And Arthur had a weary time of it. Two evenings he had to pass, after the conversation above recounted, before he got his letter; and dreadful evenings they were. His mother was majestic, glum, and cross; his sisters were silent and dignified. It was clear to him that they had all been told; and so told as to be leagued in enmity against him. What account their mother may have given to them of their future poverty, he knew not; but he felt certain that she had explained to them how cruelly he meant to turn them out on the wide world; unnatural ogre that he was. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mary was his favourite, and to her he did say a few words. \"Mamma has told you what I have done, hasn\u0027t she?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, Arthur,\" said Mary, demurely. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And what do you think about it?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Think about it!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes. Do you think she\u0027ll accept me?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh! she\u0027ll accept you. I don\u0027t doubt about that.\" How cheap girls do make themselves when talking of each other! \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And will it not be an excellent thing for me?\" said he. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But about the house, Arthur!\" And Mary looked very glum. So he said nothing further to any of them. \\n\\n \\n\\n On the day after this he got his answer; and now we will give the two letters. Arthur\u0027s was not written without much trouble and various copies; but Adela\u0027s had come straight from her heart at once. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n Hurst Staple, April, 184—. \\n\\n \\n\\n My dear Adela, \\n\\n \\n\\n You will be surprised to receive a letter from me, and more so, I am sure, when you read its contents. You have heard, I know, from Mary, of my return home. Thank God, I am quite strong again. I enjoyed my trip very much. I had feared that it would be very dull before I knew that George Bertram would go with me. \\n\\n \\n\\n I wonder whether you recollect the day when I drove you to Ripley Station! It is eighteen months ago now, I believe; and indeed the time seems much longer. I had thought then to have said to you what I have to say now; but I did not. Years ago I thought to do the same, and then also I did not. You will know what I mean. I did not like to ask you to share such poverty, such a troubled house as mine will be. \\n\\n \\n\\n But I have loved you, Adela, for years and years. Do you remember how you used to comfort me at that grievous time, when I disappointed them all so much about my degree? I remember it so well. It used to lie on my tongue then to tell you that I loved you; but that would have been folly. Then came my poor father\u0027s death, and the living which I had to take under such circumstances. I made up my mind then that it was my duty to live single. I think I told you, though I am sure you forget that. \\n\\n \\n\\n I am not richer now, but I am older. I seem to care less about poverty on my own behalf; and—though I don\u0027t know whether you will forgive me for this—I feel less compunction in asking you to be poor with me. Do not imagine from this that I feel confident as to your answer. I am very far from that. But I know that you used to love me as a friend—and I now venture to ask you to love me as my wife. \\n\\n \\n\\n Dearest Adela! I feel that I may call you so now, even if I am never to call you so again. If you will share the world with me, I will give you whatever love can give—though I can give but little more. I need not tell you how we should be circumstanced. My mother must have three hundred and fifty pounds out of the living as long as she lives; and should I survive her, I must, of course, maintain the girls. But I mean to explain to my mother that she had better live elsewhere. There will be trouble about this; but I am sure that it is right. I shall tell her of this letter to-morrow. I think she knows what my intention is, though I have not exactly told it to her. \\n\\n \\n\\n I need not say how anxious I shall be till I hear from you. I shall not expect a letter till Thursday morning; but, if possible, do let me have it then. Should it be favourable—though I do not allow myself to have any confidence—but should it be favourable, I shall be at Littlebath on Monday evening. Believe me, that I love you dearly. \\n\\n \\n\\n Yours, dear Adela, \\n\\n \\n\\n Arthur Wilkinson. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n Aunt Penelope was a lady addicted to very early habits, and consequently she and Adela had usually left the breakfast-table before the postman had visited them. From this it resulted that Adela received her letter by herself. The first words told her what it contained, and her eyes immediately became suffused with tears. After all, then, her patience was to be rewarded. But it had not been patience so much as love; love that admitted of no change; love on which absence had had no effect; love which had existed without any hope; which had been acknowledged by herself, and acknowledged as a sad misfortune. But now—. She took the letter up, but she could not read it. She turned it over, and at the end, through her tears, she saw those words—\"Believe me, that I love you dearly.\" They were not like the burning words, the sweet violent protestations of a passionate lover. But coming from him, they were enough. At last she was to be rewarded. \\n\\n \\n\\n And then at length she read it. Ah! yes; she recollected the day well when he had driven her to Ripley Station, and asked her those questions as he was persuading Dumpling to mount the hill. The very words were still in her ears. \"Would you come to such a house, Adela?\" Ay, indeed, would she—if only she were duly asked. But he—! Had it not seemed then as if he almost wished that the proffer should come from her? Not to that would she stoop. But as for sharing such a house as his—any house with him! What did true love mean, if she were not ready to do that? \\n\\n \\n\\n And she remembered, too, that comforting of which he spoke. That had been the beginning of it all, when he took those walks along the river to West Putford; when she had learned to look for his figure coming through the little wicket at the bottom of their lawn. Then she had taxed her young heart with imprudence—but in doing so she had found that it was too late. She had soon told the truth—to herself that is; and throughout she had been true. Now she had her reward; there in her hands, pressing it to her heart. He had loved her for years and years, he said. Yes, and so had she loved him; and now he should know it. But not quite at once—in some sweet hour of fullest confidence she would whisper it all to him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I think I told you; though, I am sure, you have forgotten that.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Forget it! no, not a word, not one of his tones, not a glance of his eyes, as he sat there in her father\u0027s drawing-room that morning, all but unable to express his sorrows. She could never forget the effort with which she had prevented the tell-tale blood from burning in her cheeks, or the difficulty with which she had endured his confidence. But she had endured it, and now had come her reward. Then he had come to tell her that he was too poor to marry. Much as she loved him, she had then almost despised him. But the world had told him to be wiser. The world, which makes so many niggards, had taught him to be freer of heart. Now he was worthy of her, now that he cared nothing for poverty. Yes, now she had her reward. \\n\\n \\n\\n He had allowed her till the second post for her reply. That was so kind of him, as it was necessary that she should tell her aunt. As to the nature of her reply—as to that she never doubted for a moment. She would consult her aunt; but she would do so with her mind fully made up as to the future. No aunt, no Mrs. Wilkinson, should rob her of her happiness now that he had spoken. No one should rob him of the comfort of her love! \\n\\n \\n\\n In the evening, after thinking of it for hours, she told her aunt; or, rather, handed to her Arthur\u0027s letter, that she might read it. Miss Penelope\u0027s face grew very long as she did read it; and she made this remark—\"Three hundred and fifty pounds! why, my dear, there will be only one hundred and fifty left.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We can\u0027t keep our carriage, certainly, aunt.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then you mean to accept him?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, aunt.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, dear! oh, dear! What will you do when the children come?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We must make the best of it, aunt.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, dear! oh, dear! And you will have his mother with you always.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"If so, then we should not be so very poor; but I do not think that that is what Arthur means.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n There was not much more said about it between them; and at last, in the seclusion of her own bedroom, Adela wrote her letter. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n Littlebath, Tuesday night. \\n\\n \\n\\n Dear Arthur, \\n\\n \\n\\n I received your letter this morning; but as you were so kind as to give me a day to answer it, I have put off doing so till I could be quite alone. It will be a very simple answer. I value your love more than anything in the world. You have my whole heart. I hope, for your sake, that the troubles which you speak of will not be many; but whatever they may be, I will share them. If I can, I will lessen them. \\n\\n \\n\\n I hope it is not unmaidenly to say that I have received your dear letter with true delight; I do not know why it should be. We have known each other so long, that it is almost natural that I should love you. I do love you dearly, dearest Arthur; and with a heart thankful for God\u0027s goodness to me, I will put my hand in yours with perfect trust—fearing nothing, then, as far as this world is concerned. \\n\\n \\n\\n I do not regard the poverty of which you speak, at least not for my own sake. What I have of my own is, I know, very little. I wish now that I could make it more for you. But, no; I will wish for nothing more, seeing that so much has been given to me. Everything has been given to me when I have your love. \\n\\n \\n\\n I hope that this will not interfere with your mother\u0027s comfort. If anything now could make me unhappy, it would be that she should not be pleased at our prospects. Give her my kindest, kindest love; and tell her that I hope she will let me look on her as a mother. \\n\\n \\n\\n I will write to Mary very soon; but bid her write to me first. I cannot tell her how happy, how very happy I really am, till she has first wished me joy. \\n\\n \\n\\n I have, of course, told aunt Penelope. She, too, says something about poverty. I tell her it is croaking. The honest do not beg their bread; do they, Arthur? But in spite of her croaking, she will be very happy to see you on Monday, if it shall suit you to come. If so, let me have one other little line. But I am so contented now, that I shall hardly be more so even to have you here. \\n\\n \\n\\n God bless you, my own, own, own dearest. \\n\\n \\n\\n Ever yours with truest affection, \\n\\n \\n\\n Adela. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n And I also hope that Adela\u0027s letter will not be considered unmaidenly; but I have my fears. There will be those who will say that it is sadly deficient in reserve. Ah! had she not been reserved enough for the last four or five years? Reserve is beautiful in a maiden if it be rightly timed. Sometimes one would fain have more of it. But when the heart is full, and when it may speak out; when time, and circumstances, and the world permit—then we should say that honesty is better than reserve. Adela\u0027s letter was honest on the spur of the moment. Her reserve had been the work of years. \\n\\n \\n\\n Arthur, at any rate, was satisfied. Her letter seemed to him to be the very perfection of words. Armed with that he would face his mother, though she appeared armed from head to foot in the Stapledean panoply. While he was reading his letter he was at breakfast with them all; and when he had finished it for the second time, he handed it across the table to his mother. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh! I suppose so,\" was her only answer, as she gave it him back. \\n\\n \\n\\n The curiosity of the girls was too great now for the composure of their silent dignity. \"It is from Adela,\" said Mary; \"what does she say?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You may read it,\" said Arthur, again handing the letter across the table. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, I do wish you joy,\" said Mary, \"though there will be so very little money.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Seeing that Arthur, since his father\u0027s death, had, in fact, supported his mother and sisters out of his own income, this reception of his news was rather hard upon him. And so he felt it. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You will not have to share the hardships,\" he said, as he left the room; \"and so you need not complain.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n There was nothing more said about it that morning; but in the evening, when they were alone, he spoke to his sister again. \"You will write to her, Mary, I hope?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, I will write to her,\" said Mary, half ashamed of herself. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Perhaps it is not surprising that my mother should be vexed, seeing the false position in which both she and I have been placed; partly by my fault, for I should not have accepted the living under such conditions.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, Arthur, you would not have refused it?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I ought to have done so. But, Mary, you and the girls should be ready to receive Adela with open arms. What other sister could I have given you that you would have loved better?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, no one; not for her own sake—no one half so well.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then tell her so, and do not cloud her prospects by writing about the house. You have all had shelter and comfort hitherto, and be trustful that it will be continued to you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n This did very well with his sister; but the affair with his mother was much more serious. He began by telling her that he should go to Littlebath on Monday, and be back on Wednesday. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then I shall go to Bowes on Wednesday,\" said Mrs. Wilkinson. Now we all know that Bowes is a long way from Staplehurst. The journey has already been made once in these pages. But Mrs. Wilkinson was as good as her word. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"To Bowes!\" said Arthur. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, to Bowes, sir; to Lord Stapledean. That is, if you hold to your scheme of turning me out of my own house.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I think it would be better, mother, that we should have two establishments.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And, therefore, I am to make way for you and that—\" viper, she was going to say again; but looking into her son\u0027s face, she became somewhat more merciful—\"for you,\" she said, \"and that chit!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"As clergyman of the parish, I think that I ought to live in the parsonage. You, mother, will have so much the larger portion of the income.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Very well. There need be no more words about it. I shall start for Bowes on next Wednesday.\" And so she did. \\n\\n \\n\\n Arthur wrote his \"one other little line.\" As it was three times as long as his first letter, it shall not be printed. And he did make his visit to Littlebath. How happy Adela was as she leant trustingly on his arm, and felt that it was her own! He stayed, however, but one night, and was back at Staplehurst before his mother started for Bowes. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2741/75498.html","bookId":1380,"book":{"id":1380,"title":"The Bertrams","description":"简介： This is undoubtedly the age of humanityas far, at least, as England is concerned.
