{"id":21509,"no":40,"title":"CHAPTER X. REACHING HOME.","content":"Early in their journeyings together, Mrs. Cox had learned from George that he was possessed of an eccentric old uncle; and not long afterwards, she had learned from Arthur that this uncle was very rich, that he was also childless, and that he was supposed to be very fond of his nephew. Putting all these things together, knowing that Bertram had no profession, and thinking that therefore he must be a rich man, she had considered herself to be acting with becoming prudence in dropping Major Biffin for his sake. \n \n But on the day after the love scene recorded in the last chapter, a strange change came over the spirit of her dream. \"I am a very poor man,\" Bertram had said to her, after making some allusion to what had taken place. \n \n \"If that were all, that would make no difference with me,\" said Mrs. Cox, magnanimously. \n \n \"If that were all, Annie! What does that mean?\" \n \n \"If I really loved a man, I should not care about his being poor. But your poverty is what I should call riches, I take it.\" \n \n \"No, indeed. My poverty is absolute poverty. My own present income is about two hundred a year.\" \n \n \"Oh, I don\u0027t understand the least about money myself. I never did. I was such a child when I was married to Cox. But I thought, Mr. Bertram, your uncle was very rich.\" \n \n \"So he is; as rich as a gold-mine. But we are not very good friends—at any rate, not such friends as to make it probable that he will leave me a farthing. He has a granddaughter of his own.\" \n \n This, and a little more of the same kind, taught Mrs. Cox that it behoved her to be cautious. That Major Biffin had a snug little income over and above that derived from his profession was a fact that had been very well ascertained. That he was very dry, as dry as a barber\u0027s block, might be true. That George Bertram was an amusing fellow, and made love in much better style than the major, certainly was true. But little as she might know about money, Mrs. Cox did know this—that when poverty comes in at the door, love flies out at the window; that eating and drinking are stern necessities; that love in a cottage is supposed to be, what she would call, bosh; and that her own old home used to be very unpleasant when Cox was in debt, and those eastern Jewish harpies would come down upon him with his overdue bills. Considering all this, Mrs. Cox thought it might be well not to ratify her engagement with Mr. Bertram till after they should reach Southampton. What if Biffin—the respectable Biffin—should again come forward! \n \n And so they went on for a few days longer. Bertram, when they were together, called her Annie, and once again asked her whether she loved him. \"Whether I do, or whether I do not, I shall give you no answer now,\" she had said, half laughing. \"We have both been very foolish already, and it is time that we should begin to have our senses. Isn\u0027t it?\" But still she sat next him at dinner, and still she walked with him. Once, indeed, he found her saying a word to Major Biffin, as that gentleman stood opposite to her chair upon the deck. But as soon as the major\u0027s back was turned, she said to Bertram, \"I think the barber\u0027s block wants to be new curled, doesn\u0027t it? I declare the barber\u0027s man has forgotten to comb out it\u0027s whiskers.\" So that Bertram had no ground for jealousy of the major. \n \n Somewhere about this time, Mrs. Price deserted them at dinner. She was going to sit, she said, with Mrs. Bangster, and Dr. Shaughnessey, and the judge. Mrs. Bangster had made a promise to old Mr. Price in England to look after her; and, therefore, she thought it better to go back to Mrs. Bangster before they reached Southampton. They were now past Gibraltar. So on that day, Mrs. Price\u0027s usual chair at dinner was vacant, and Wilkinson, looking down the tables, saw that room had been made for her next to Dr. Shaughnessey. And on her other side, sat Captain M\u0027Gramm, in despite of Mrs. Bangster\u0027s motherly care and of his own wife at home. On the following morning, Mrs. Price and Captain M\u0027Gramm were walking the deck together just as they had been used to do on the other side of Suez. \n \n And so things went on till the day before their arrival at Southampton. Mrs. Cox still kept her seat next to Bertram, and opposite to Wilkinson, though no other lady remained to countenance her. She and Bertram still walked the deck arm in arm; but their whisperings were not so low as they had been, nor were their words so soft, nor, indeed, was the temper of the lady so sweet. What if she should have thrown away all the advantages of the voyage! What if she had fallen between two stools! She began to think that it would be better to close with one or with the other—with the one despite his poverty, or with the other despite his head. \n \n And now it was the evening of the last day. They had sighted the coast of Devonshire, and the following morning would see them within the Southampton waters. Ladies had packed their luggage; subscriptions had been made for the band; the captain\u0027s health had been drunk at the last dinner; and the mail boxes were being piled between the decks. \n \n \"Well, it is nearly over,\" said Mrs. Cox, as she came upon deck after dinner, warmly cloaked. \"How cold we all are!\" \n \n \"Yes; it is nearly over,\" answered Bertram. \"What an odd life of itself one of these voyages is! How intimate people are who will never see each other again!\" \n \n \"Yes; that is the way, I suppose. Oh, Mr. Bertram!\" \n \n \"Well, what would you have?\" \n \n \"Ah, me! I hardly know. Fate has ever been against me, and I know that it will be so to the last.\" \n \n \"Is it not cold?\" said Bertram, buttoning up a greatcoat as he spoke. \n \n \"Very cold! very cold!\" said Mrs. Cox. \"But there is something much colder than the weather—very much colder.\" \n \n \"You are severe, Mrs. Cox.\" \n \n \"Yes. It is Mrs. Cox here. It was Annie when we were off Gibraltar. That comes of being near home. But I knew that it would be so. I hate the very idea of home.\" And she put her handkerchief to her eyes. \n \n She had had her chance as far as Bertram was concerned, and had let it pass from her. He did not renew his protestations; but in lieu of doing so, lit a cigar, and walked away into the fore-part of the vessel. \"After all, Arthur is right,\" said he to himself; \"marriage is too serious a thing to be arranged in a voyage from Alexandria to Southampton.\" \n \n But luckily for Mrs. Cox, everybody did not think as he did. He had gone from her ruthlessly, cruelly, falsely, with steps which sounded as though there were triumph in his escape, and left her seated alone near the skylights. But she was not long alone. As she looked after him along the deck, the head of Major Biffin appeared to her, emerging from the saloon stairs. She said nothing to herself now about barber\u0027s blocks or uncurled whiskers. \n \n \"Well, Mrs. Cox,\" said the major, accosting her. \n \n \"Well, Major Biffin;\" and the major thought that he saw in her eye some glimpse of the smile as of old. \n \n \"We are very near home now, Mrs. Cox,\" said the major. \n \n \"Very near indeed,\" said Mrs. Cox. And then there was a slight pause, during which Major Biffin took an opportunity of sitting down not very far from his companion. \n \n \"I hope you have enjoyed your voyage,\" said he. \n \n \"Which voyage?\" she asked. \n \n \"Oh! your voyage home from Alexandria—your voyage since you made the acquaintance of Mr.—what\u0027s his name, the parson\u0027s cousin?\" \n \n \"Mr. What\u0027s-his-name, as you call him, is nothing to me, I can assure you, Major Biffin. His real name, however, is Bertram. He has been very civil when some other people were not inclined to be so, that is all.\" \n \n \"Is that all? The people here do say—\" \n \n \"Then I tell you what, Major Biffin, I do not care one straw what the people say—not one straw. You know whose fault it has been if I have been thrown with this stranger. Nobody knows it as well. And mind this, Major Biffin, I shall always do as I like in such matters without reference to you or to any one else. I am my own mistress.\" \n \n \"And do you mean to remain so?\" \n \n \"Ask no questions, and then you\u0027ll be told no stories.\" \n \n \"That\u0027s civil.\" \n \n \"If you don\u0027t like it, you had better go, for there\u0027s more to follow of the same sort.\" \n \n \"You are very sharp to-night.\" \n \n \"Not a bit sharper than I shall be to-morrow.\" \n \n \"One is afraid even to speak to you now.\" \n \n \"Then one had better hold one\u0027s tongue.\" \n \n Mrs. Cox was receiving her suitor rather sharply; but she probably knew his disposition. He did not answer her immediately, but sat biting the top of his cane. \"I\u0027ll tell you what it is, Mrs. Cox,\" he said at last, \"I don\u0027t like this kind of thing.\" \n \n \"Don\u0027t you, Mr. Biffin? And what kind of thing do you like?\" \n \n \"I like you.\" \n \n \"Psha! Tell me something new, if you must tell me anything.\" \n \n \"Come, Annie; do be serious for a moment. There isn\u0027t much time left now, and I\u0027ve come to you in order that I may get a plain answer.\" \n \n \"If you want a plain answer, you\u0027d better ask a plain question. I don\u0027t know what you mean.\" \n \n \"Will you have me? That\u0027s a plain question, or the deuce is in it.\" \n \n \"And what should I do with you?\" \n \n \"Why, be Mrs. Biffin, of course.\" \n \n \"Ha! ha! ha! And it has come to that, has it? What was it you said to Dr. O\u0027Shaughnessey when we were off Point de Galle?\" \n \n \"Well, what did I say?\" \n \n \"I know what you said well enough. And so do you, too. If I served you right, I should never speak to you again.\" \n \n \"A man doesn\u0027t like to be humbugged, you know, before a whole shipful of people,\" said the major, defending himself. \n \n \"And a woman likes it just as little, Major Biffin; please to remember that.\" \n \n \"Well; I\u0027m sure you\u0027ve been down upon me long enough.\" \n \n \"Not a bit longer than you deserved. You told O\u0027Shaughnessey, that it was all very well to amuse yourself, going home. I hope you like your amusement now. I have liked mine very well, I can assure you.\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t think so bad of you as to believe you care for that fellow.\" \n \n \"There are worse fellows than he is, Major Biffin. But there, I have had my revenge; and now if you have anything to say, I\u0027ll give you an answer.\" \n \n \"I\u0027ve only to say, Annie, that I love you better than any woman in the world.\" \n \n \"I may believe as much of that as I like.\" \n \n \"You may believe it all. Come, there\u0027s my hand.\" \n \n \"Well, I suppose I must forgive you. There\u0027s mine. Will that please you?\" \n \n Major Biffin was the happiest man in the world, and Mrs. Cox went to her berth that night not altogether dissatisfied. Before she did so, she had the major\u0027s offer in writing in her pocket; and had shown it to Mrs. Price, with whom she was now altogether reconciled. \n \n \"I only wish, Minnie, that there was no Mrs. M\u0027Gramm,\" said she. \n \n \"He wouldn\u0027t be the man for me at all, my dear; so don\u0027t let that fret you.\" \n \n \"There\u0027s as good fish in the sea as ever were caught yet; eh, Minnie?\" \n \n \"Of course there are. Though of course you think there never was such a fish as Biffin.\" \n \n \"He\u0027ll do well enough for me, Minnie; and when you catch a bigger, and a better, I won\u0027t begrudge him you.\" \n \n That night Mrs. Cox took her evening modicum of creature-comforts sitting next to her lover, the major; and our two friends were left alone by themselves. The news had soon spread about the ship, and to those ladies who spoke to her on the subject, Mrs. Cox made no secret of the fact. Men in this world catch their fish by various devices; and it is necessary that these schemes should be much studied before a man can call himself a fisherman. It is the same with women; and Mrs. Cox was an Izaak Walton among her own sex. Had she not tied her fly with skill, and thrown her line with a steady hand, she would not have had her trout in her basket. There was a certain amount of honour due to her for her skill, and she was not ashamed to accept it. \n \n \"Good-night, Mrs. Cox,\" Bertram said to her that evening, with a good-humoured tone; \"I hear that I am to congratulate you.\" \n \n \"Good-night,\" said she, giving him her hand. \"And I\u0027ll say good-bye, too, for we shall all be in such a flurry to-morrow morning. I\u0027m sure you think I\u0027ve done the right thing—don\u0027t you? And, mind this, I shall hope to see you some day.\" And so saying, she gave him a kindly grasp, and they parted. \"Done right!\" said Bertram; \"yes, I suppose she has; right enough at least as far as I am concerned. After all, what husband is so convenient as a barber\u0027s block?\" \n \n On the following morning they steamed up the Southampton river, and at nine o\u0027clock they were alongside the quay. All manner of people had come on board in boats, and the breakfast was eaten in great confusion. But few of the ladies were to be seen. They had tea and rolls in their own cabins, and did not appear till the last moment. Among these were Mrs. Cox and Mrs. Price. \n \n These ladies during their journey home had certainly not been woe-begone, either in personal appearance or in manner. And who would have the heart to wish that they should be so? They had been dressed as young ladies on board ship usually do dress, so that their widowhood had been forgotten; and, but for their babies, their wifehood might have been forgotten also. \n \n But now they were to be met by family friends—by friends who were thinking of nothing but their bereavements. Old Mr. Price came to meet them on board, and Mrs. Cox\u0027s uncle; old gentlemen with faces prepared for sadness, and young ladies with sympathetic handkerchiefs. How signally surprised the sad old gentlemen and the sympathetic young ladies must have been! \n \n Not a whit! Just as our friends were about to leave the ship that morning, with all their luggage collected round them, they were startled by the apparition of two sombre female figures, buried in most sombre tokens of affliction. Under the deep crape of their heavy black bonnets were to be seen that chiefest sign of heavy female woe—a widow\u0027s cap. What signal of sorrow that grief holds out, ever moves so much as this? Their eyes were red with weeping, as could be seen when, for a moment, their deep bordered handkerchiefs were allowed to fall from their faces. Their eyes were red with weeping, and the agonizing grief of domestic bereavement sat chiselled on every feature. If you stood near enough, your heart would melt at the sound of their sobs. \n \n Alas! that forms so light, that creatures so young, should need to be shrouded in such vestments! They were all crape, that dull, weeping, widow\u0027s crape, from the deck up to their shoulders. There they stood, monuments of death, living tombs, whose only sign of life was in their tears. There they stood, till they might fall, vanquished by the pangs of memory, into the arms of their respective relations. \n \n They were Mrs. Cox and Mrs. Price. Bertram and Wilkinson, as they passed them, lifted their hats and bowed, and the two ladies observing them, returned their salutation with the coldest propriety. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2741/75496.html","bookId":1380,"book":{"id":1380,"title":"The Bertrams","description":"简介： This is undoubtedly the age of humanityas far, at least, as England is concerned.
