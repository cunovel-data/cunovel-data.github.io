{"id":21482,"no":13,"title":"CHAPTER XIII. LITTLEBATH.","content":"I abhor a mystery. I would fain, were it possible, have my tale run through from its little prologue to the customary marriage in its last chapter, with all the smoothness incidental to ordinary life. I have no ambition to surprise my reader. Castles with unknown passages are not compatible with my homely muse. I would as lief have to do with a giant in my book—a real giant, such as Goliath—as with a murdering monk with a scowling eye. The age for such delights is, I think, gone. We may say historically of Mrs. Radcliffe\u0027s time that there were mysterious sorrows in those days. They are now as much out of date as are the giants. \\n\\n \\n\\n I would wish that a serene gratification might flow from my pages, unsullied by a single start. Now I am aware that there is that in the last chapter which appears to offend against the spirit of calm recital which I profess. People will begin to think that they are to be kept in the dark as to who is who; that it is intended that their interest in the novel shall depend partly on a guess. I would wish to have no guessing, and therefore I at once proceed to tell all about it. \\n\\n \\n\\n Miss Caroline Waddington was the granddaughter of old Mr. George Bertram; and was, therefore, speaking with absolute technical propriety, the first-cousin once removed of her lover, young Mr. George Bertram—a degree of relationship which happily admits of love and matrimony. \\n\\n \\n\\n Old Mr. Bertram has once or twice been alluded to as a bachelor; and most of those who were best acquainted with him had no doubt of his being so. To you, my reader, is permitted the great privilege of knowing that he was married very early in life. He, doubtless, had his reasons for keeping this matter a secret at the time, and the very early death of his wife saved him from the necessity of much talking about it afterwards. His wife had died in giving birth to a daughter, but the child had survived. There was then living a sister of Mrs. Bertram\u0027s, who had been married some few years to a Mr. Baker, and the infant was received into this family, of which our friend Miss Baker was a child. Miss Baker was therefore a niece, by marriage, of Mr. Bertram. In this family, Caroline Bertram was educated, and she and Mary Baker were brought up together as sisters. During this time Mr. Bertram did his duty by his daughter as regards money, as far as his means then went, and was known in that family to be her father; but elsewhere he was not so known. The Bakers lived in France, and the fact of his having any such domestic tie was not suspected among his acquaintance in England. \\n\\n \\n\\n In the course of time his daughter married one Mr. Waddington, hardly with the full consent of the Bakers, for Mr. Waddington\u0027s means were small—but not decidedly in opposition to it; nor had the marriage been opposed by Mr. Bertram. He of course was asked to assist in supplying money for the young couple. This he refused to give; but he offered to Mr. Waddington occupation by which an income could be earned. Mr. Waddington wisely acceded to his views, and, had he lived, would doubtless have lived to become a rich man. He died, however, within four years of his marriage, and it so fell out that his wife did not survive him above a year or two. \\n\\n \\n\\n Of this marriage, Caroline Waddington, our heroine, was the sole offspring. Mr. Waddington\u0027s commercial enterprises had not caused him to live in London, though he had been required to be there frequently. Mr. Bertram had, therefore, seen more of him than of his own daughter. The infant had been born in the house of the Bakers, and there she was brought up. As an orphan of four years old, she had come under the care of Mary Baker, and under her care she remained. Miss Baker was therefore not in truth her aunt. What was their exact relationship I leave as a calculation to those conversant with the mysteries of genealogy. I believe myself that she was almost as nearly connected with her lover. \\n\\n \\n\\n When Mr. Waddington and his daughter were both dead, Mr. Bertram felt himself to be altogether relieved from family ties. He was not yet an old man, being then about fifty-five; but he was a very rich man. It was of course considered that he would provide liberally for his grandchild. But when asked to do so by Miss Baker, he had replied that she was provided for; that he had enabled the child\u0027s father to leave behind him four thousand pounds, which for a girl was a provision sufficiently liberal; that he would not give rise to false hopes that she would be his heiress; but that if his niece, Mary Baker, would take the charge of her, he would allow an income for the purpose. This he had done with sufficient liberality. \\n\\n \\n\\n All that is mysterious has now, I believe, been unravelled, and we may go back to our story. Of Mr. Pritchett, we should perhaps say a word. He had been habituated in his sundry money dealings to look on Miss Baker as his patron\u0027s niece, and had always called her as such. Indeed, the connection had been so far back that he usually styled her Miss Mary. But he did not know, nor—though he was very suspicious on the matter—did he quite suspect what was the truth as to Miss Waddington. She was niece to his patron\u0027s niece; he knew no more than that, excepting, of course, that she was the daughter of Mr. Waddington, and that she was mistress in her own right of four thousand pounds. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Pritchett was very anxious about his patron\u0027s wealth. Here was Mr. Bertram turned seventy years of age—Mr. Pritchett himself was sixty-six—and no one knew who was to be his heir. As far as he, Mr. Pritchett, was aware, he had no heir. Mr. George would naturally be so—so thought Mr. Pritchett; and the old man\u0027s apparent anxiety respecting his nephew, the habit which he had now given himself for years of paying the cost of that nephew\u0027s education, and the income which he now allowed him, all led to such a conclusion. But then the uncle liked so well to lead, and Mr. George was so unwilling to be led! Had Waddington lived, he would have been the heir, doubtless. Miss Waddington might still be so, or even Miss Baker. Mr. Bertram, in his way, was certainly very fond of Miss Baker. It was thus that Mr. Pritchett speculated from day to day. George, however, was always regarded by him as the favourite in the race. \\n\\n \\n\\n And now at last we may return to our story. \\n\\n \\n\\n Having seen his uncle, George\u0027s next business was to see his lady-love. His was a disposition which would not allow him to remain quiet while his hopes were so doubtful and his heart so racked. Had he been travelling with Miss Baker ever since, and living in daily intercourse with Caroline, it is probable enough that he might by this time have been half tired of her. But his love had had no such safety-valve, and was now, therefore, bubbling and boiling within his heart in a manner very subversive of legal accuracy and injurious to legal studies. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was absolutely necessary, he said to himself, that he should know on what ground he stood; absolutely necessary, also, that he should be able to talk to some one on the subject. So he wrote to Miss Baker, saying that he intended to do himself the pleasure of renewing his acquaintance with her at Littlebath, and he determined to see Arthur Wilkinson on his way. These were the days in which Wilkinson was taking pupils at Oxford, the days in which he used to think so much of Adela Gauntlet. \\n\\n \\n\\n The meeting of the two friends was sufficiently joyous; for such love sorrows as those which oppressed Bertram when sitting in the chambers of Mr. Neversaye Die rarely oppress a young man in moments which would otherwise be jovial. And Arthur had at this time gotten over one misery, and not yet fallen into another. He had obtained the fellowship which he had hardly expected, and was commencing the life of a don, with all a don\u0027s comforts around him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, upon my word, I envy you, Arthur; I do, indeed,\" said Bertram, looking round his cousin\u0027s room at Balliol as they sat down to pass an evening quietly together. \"This was what I always looked forward to, as you did also; you have obtained it, I have forsworn it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Your envy cannot be very envious,\" said Wilkinson, laughing, \"as all my bliss is still within your own reach. You have still your rooms at Oriel if you choose to go into them.\" For Bertram had been elected to a fellowship at that college. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"All! that\u0027s easily said; but somehow it couldn\u0027t be. I don\u0027t know why it is, Arthur; but I have panted to have the privileges of an ordained priest, and yet it is not to be so. I have looked forward to ordination as the highest ambition of a man, but yet I shall never be ordained.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why not, George?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It is not my destiny.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"On such a subject, do not talk such nonsense.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, at any rate it will not be my lot. I do not mind telling you, Arthur, but there is no one else to whom I could own how weak I am. There have been moments since I have been away in which I have sworn to devote myself to this work, so sworn when every object around me was gifted with some solemn tie which should have made my oath sacred; and yet—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well—and yet? as yet everything is in your own power.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, Arthur, no, it is not so; I am now one of the myrmidons of that most special of special pleaders, Mr. Neversaye Die. I have given myself over to the glories of a horse-hair wig; \u0027whereas\u0027 and \u0027heretofore\u0027 must now be my gospel; it is my doom to propagate falsehood instead of truth. The struggle is severe at first; there is a little revulsion of feeling; but I shall do it very well after a time; as easily, I have no doubt, as Harcourt does.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It is Harcourt who has led you to this.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Perhaps so, partly; but no—I wrong myself in that. It has not been Harcourt. I have been talked over; I have weakly allowed myself to be talked out of my own resolve, but it has not been done by Harcourt. I must tell you all: it is for that that I came here.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And then he told the history of his love; that history which to men of twenty-four and girls of twenty is of such vital importance. A young man when first he loves, and first knows that his love is frequent in the thoughts of the woman he has chosen, feels himself to be separated from all humanity by an amber-tinted cloud—to be enveloped in a mystery of which common mortals know nothing. He shakes his mane as he walks on with rapid step, and regards himself almost as a god. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And did she object to your taking orders?\" asked Wilkinson. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Object! no, I am nothing to her; nothing on earth. She would not have objected to my being a shoemaker; but she said that she would advise me to think of the one trade as soon as the other.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I cannot say that I think she showed either good feeling or good taste,\" said Wilkinson, stiffly. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ah! my dear fellow, you do not know her. There was no bad taste in it, as she said it. I would defy her to say anything in bad taste. But, Arthur, that does not matter. I have told her that I should go to the bar; and, as a man of honour, I must keep my word to her.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n His cousin had not much inclination to lecture him. Wilkinson himself was now a clergyman; but he had become so mainly because he had failed in obtaining the power of following any other profession. He would have gone to the bar had he been able; and felt himself by no means called to rebuke Bertram for doing what he would fain have done himself. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But she has not accepted you, you say. Why should she be so unwilling that you should take orders? Her anxiety on your behalf tells a strong tale in your own favour.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ah! you say that because you do not understand her. She was able to give me advice without giving the least shadow of encouragement. Indeed, when she did advise me, I had not even told her that I loved her. But the fact is, I cannot bear this state any longer. I will know the worst at any rate. I wish you could see her, Arthur; you would not wonder that I should be uneasy.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And so he went on with a lover\u0027s customary eloquence till a late hour in the night. Wilkinson was all patience; but about one o\u0027clock he began to yawn, and then they went to bed. Early on the following morning, Bertram started for Littlebath. \\n\\n \\n\\n The Littlebath world lives mostly in lodgings, and Miss Baker and Caroline lived there as the world mostly does. There are three sets of persons who resort to Littlebath: there is the heavy fast, and the lighter fast set; there is also the pious set. Of the two fast sets neither is scandalously fast. The pace is never very awful. Of the heavies, it may be said that the gentlemen generally wear their coats padded, are frequently seen standing idle about the parades and terraces, that they always keep a horse, and trot about the roads a good deal when the hounds go out. The ladies are addicted to whist and false hair, but pursue their pleasures with a discreet economy. Of the lighter fast set, assembly balls are the ruling passion; but even in these there is no wild extravagance. The gentlemen of this division keep usually two horses, on the sale of one of which their mind is much bent. They drink plentifully of cherry-brandy on hunting days; but, as a rule, they do not often misbehave themselves. They are very careful not to be caught in marriage, and talk about women much as a crafty knowing salmon might be presumed to talk about anglers. The ladies are given to dancing, of course, and are none of them nearly so old as you might perhaps be led to imagine. They greatly eschew card-playing; but, nevertheless, now and again one of them may be seen to lapse from her sphere and fall into that below, if we may justly say that the votaries of whist are below the worshippers of Terpsichore. Of the pious set much needs not be said, as their light has never been hid under a bushel. In spite of hunt-clubs and assembly-rooms, they are the predominant power. They live on the fat of the land. They are a strong, unctuous, moral, uncharitable people. The men never cease making money for themselves, nor the women making slippers for their clergymen. \\n\\n \\n\\n But though the residents at Littlebath are thus separated as a rule into three classes, the classes do not always keep themselves accurately to their divisions. There will be some who own a double allegiance. One set will tread upon another. There will be those who can hardly be placed in either. Miss Baker was among this latter number: on principle, she was an admirer of the great divine on the domestic comfort of whose toes so many fair fingers had employed themselves; but, nevertheless, she was not averse to a rubber in its mildest forms. Caroline did not play whist, but she occasionally gave way to the allurement prevalent among the younger female world of Littlebath. \\n\\n \\n\\n Miss Baker lived in lodgings, and Bertram therefore went to an hotel. Had she been mistress of the largest house in Littlebath, he would hardly have ventured to propose himself as a guest. The \"Plough,\" however, is a good inn, and he deposited himself there. The hunting season at Littlebath had commenced, and Bertram soon found that had he so wished he could with but little trouble have provided himself with a stud in the coffee-room of his hotel. \\n\\n \\n\\n He had intended to call on Miss Baker on the evening of his arrival; but he had not actually told her that he would do so: and though he walked down to the terrace in which she lived, his courage failed him when he got there, and he would not go in. \"It may be that evening calls are not the thing at Littlebath,\" he said to himself; and so he walked back to his hotel. \\n\\n \\n\\n And on the following day he did not go before two o\u0027clock. The consequence was, that poor Miss Baker and her niece were kept at home in a state of miserable suspense. To them his visit was quite as important as to himself; and by one of them, the elder namely, it was regarded with an anxiety quite as nervous. \\n\\n \\n\\n When he did call, he was received with all the hospitality due to an old friend. \"Why had he not come to tea the night before? Tea had been kept for him till eleven o\u0027clock. Why, at any rate, had he not come to breakfast? He had been much nicer in Jerusalem,\" Miss Baker said. \\n\\n \\n\\n Bertram answered hardly with the spirit which had marked all that he had said in that far-away land. \"He had been afraid to disturb them so late; and had been unwilling to intrude so early.\" Miss Waddington looked up at him from the collar she was working, and began to ask herself whether she really did like him so much. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Of course you will dine with us,\" said Miss Baker. George said he would, but assured her that he had not intended to give so much trouble. Could this be the same man, thought Caroline, who had snubbed Mr. M\u0027Gabbery, and had stood by laughing when she slipped into the water? \\n\\n \\n\\n All manner of questions were then asked and answered respecting their different journeys. Constantinople was described on one side, and the Tyrol; and on the other the perils of the ride to Jaffa, the discomforts of the Austrian boat to Alexandria, and the manners of the ladies from India with whom Miss Baker and her niece had travelled in their passage from Egypt to Marseilles. Then they said something about uncle George—not that Miss Baker so called him—and Bertram said that he had learnt that Miss Baker had been staying at Hadley. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes,\" said she; \"when I am in town, I have always money matters to arrange with Mr. Bertram, or rather to have arranged by Mr. Pritchett; and I usually stay a day or two at Hadley. On this occasion I was there a week.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n George could not but think that up to the period of their meeting at Jerusalem, Miss Baker had been instructed to be silent about Hadley, but that she was now permitted to speak out openly. \\n\\n \\n\\n And so they sat and talked for an hour. Caroline had given her aunt strict injunctions not to go out of the room, so as to leave them together during Bertram\u0027s first visit. \"Of course it would be palpable that you did so for a purpose,\" said Caroline. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And why not?\" said Miss Baker, innocently. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Never mind, aunt; but pray do not. I don\u0027t wish it.\" Miss Baker of course obeyed, as she always did. And so George sat there, talking about anything or nothing, rather lack-a-daisically, till he got up to take his leave. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You have not a horse here, I suppose?\" said Miss Baker. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No; but why do you ask? I can get one in ten minutes, no doubt.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Because Caroline will be so glad to have some one to ride with her.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Nothing will induce aunt Mary to mount a steed since the day she was lifted out of her saddle at Jaffa,\" said Caroline. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, that journey, Mr. Bertram! but I am a stronger woman than I ever thought I was to have lived through it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n It was soon arranged that George should go back to his inn and hire a horse, and that he and Caroline should then ride together. In another hour or so they were cantering up the face of Ridgebury Hill. \\n\\n \\n\\n But the ride produced very little. Caroline here required her attention, and George did not find it practicable to remain close enough to his love, or long enough close to her, to say what he had to say with that emphasis which he felt that the subject demanded. There were some little tender allusions to feats of horsemanship done in Syria, some mention of the Mount of Olives, of Miss Todd\u0027s picnic, and the pool of Siloam, which might, if properly handled, have led to much; but they did lead to nothing: and when George helped Miss Waddington to dismount at Miss Baker\u0027s door, that young lady had almost come to the conclusion that he had thought better of his love, and that it would be well that she should think better of hers. \\n\\n \\n\\n In accordance with our professed attempt at plain speaking, it may be as well explained here that Miss Baker, with the view of sounding her uncle\u0027s views and wishes, had observed to him that George had appeared to her to admire Caroline very much. Had the old man remarked, as he might so probably have done, that they were two fools, and would probably become two beggars, Miss Baker would have known that the match would be displeasing to him. But he had not done so. \"Ah!\" he said; \"did he? It is singular they should have met.\" Now Miss Baker in her wisdom had taken this as a strong hint that the match would not be displeasing to him. \\n\\n \\n\\n Miss Baker had clearly been on George\u0027s side from the beginning. Perhaps, had she shown a little opposition, Caroline\u0027s ardour might have been heightened. As it was, she had professed to doubt. She had nothing to say against George; much might doubtless be said in his favour, but—. In fact, Miss Waddington would have been glad to know what were the intentions of Mr. George Bertram senior. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I really wish he had stayed away,\" she said to her aunt as they were getting ready for dinner. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Nonsense, Caroline; why should he have stayed away? Why should you expect him to stay away? Had he stayed away, you would have been the first to grumble. Don\u0027t be missish, my dear.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Missish! Upon my word, aunt Mary, you are becoming severe. What I mean is, that I don\u0027t think he cares so very much for me; and on the whole, I am not—not quite sure, whether—well, I won\u0027t say anything more; only it does seem to me that you are much more in love with him than I am.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Bertram came to dinner; and so also did one of the Littlebath curates, a very energetic young man, but who had not yet achieved above one or two pairs of worked slippers and a kettle-holder. Greater things, however, were no doubt in store for him if he would remain true to his mission. Aunt Mary had intended to ask no one; but Caroline had declared that it was out of the question to expect that Mr. Bertram should drink his wine by himself. \\n\\n \\n\\n The whole evening was dull enough, and the work of disenchantment on Caroline\u0027s part was nearly accomplished; but Bertram, a few minutes before he went away, as the curate was expatiating to Miss Baker on the excellence of his rector\u0027s last sermon, found an occasion to say one word. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Miss Waddington, if I call to-morrow, early after breakfast, will you see me?\" Miss Waddington looked as though there were nothing in the proposition to ruffle her serenity, and said that she would. George\u0027s words had been tame enough, but there had been something in the fire of his eye that at last reminded her of Jerusalem. \\n\\n \\n\\n On the next morning, punctually at ten, his knock was heard at the door. Caroline had at first persisted that her aunt should not absent herself; but even Miss Baker would not obey such an injunction as this. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How do you expect that the poor young man is to behave?\" she had said. \"I do not much care how he behaves,\" Caroline had replied. But, nevertheless, she did care. \\n\\n \\n\\n She was therefore sitting alone when Bertram entered the room. He walked up to her and took her hand, and as he did so he seemed to be altogether a different man from that of yesterday. There was purpose enough in his countenance now, and a purpose, apparently, which he had an intention of pursuing with some energy. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Miss Waddington,\" he said, still holding her hand; \"Caroline! Or am I to apologize for calling you so? or is the privilege to be my own?\" and then, still holding her hand, he stood as though expectant of an answer that should settle the affair at once. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Our connection through your uncle entitles you to the privilege,\" said Caroline, smiling, and using a woman\u0027s wiles to get out of the difficulty. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I will take no privilege from you on such a basis. What I have to ask of you must be given on my own account, or on my own refused. Caroline, since we parted in that room in Jerusalem, I have thought seriously of little else than of you. You could not answer me then; you gave me no answer; you did not know your own heart, you said. You must know it now. Absence has taught me much, and it must have taught you something.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And what has it taught you?\" said she, with her eyes fixed on the ground. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That the world has but one thing desirable for me, and that I should not take a man\u0027s part unless I endeavoured to obtain it. I am here to ask for it. And now, what has absence taught you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, so many things! I cannot repeat my lesson in one word, as you do.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Come, Caroline, I look at least for sincerity from you. You are too good, too gracious to indulge a girlish vanity at the cost of a man\u0027s suspense.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Missish and girlish! Miss Waddington felt that it behoved her to look to her character. These were words which had not usually been applied to her. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Indeed, Mr. Bertram, I should think myself unpardonable to keep you in suspense.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Then answer me,\" said he. He had by this time let go her hand, and was standing at a little distance from her, on the hearth-rug. Never had lady been wooed in a sterner manner; but Caroline almost felt that she liked him the better for it. He had simpered and said his little nothings so like an ordinary gentleman during their ride, that his present brusqueness was quite a relief to her. \\n\\n \\n\\n But still she did not answer him at once. She essayed to stick her needle into her work, and pricked her finger in lieu of it. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Come, Caroline; am I wrong in supposing that now at least you must know your own feelings? Or shall I tell you again how dearly, how truly I love you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No!—no!—no!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Answer me, then. In honest, plain, Christian sincerity, answer me; as a true woman should answer a true man. Do you love me?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n For a moment there was no answer. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, I will not ask again. I will not torment you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, Mr. Bertram! What am I to say? What would you have me say? Do not be so stern with me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Stern!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, are you not stern?\" And coming up close to him, she looked into his face. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Caroline,\" said he, \"will you be my wife?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I will.\" It was a motion of the lips rather than a spoken word; but, nevertheless, he heard it. Fool that he was not to have heard it before in the beating of her heart; not to have seen it in the tear in her eye; not to have felt it in the warmth of her hand. \\n\\n \\n\\n On that afternoon Miss Waddington\u0027s ride was much more energetic, and on that evening Miss Baker did not think it necessary to catch a curate to drink wine with George Bertram. He was made quite at home, and given to understand that he had better leave the dining-room when the ladies did so. \\n\\n \\n\\n There was much talked over that evening and the next day: the upshot of which was, that no marriage could take place till next summer; that perhaps it might be expedient to postpone it till the summer twelvemonths. To this George put, or would have put, an absolute veto; but Miss Baker only shook her head, and smilingly said that she thought it must be so. Nothing was to be done before Christmas; but as Miss Baker was to be at Hadley very early in January, she undertook to inform Mr. Bertram, and gave strong hopes that he would be prevailed on to favour the marriage. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It can make no difference to my purpose whether he does or no,\" said George, very independently. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2741/75469.html","bookId":1380,"book":{"id":1380,"title":"The Bertrams","description":"简介： This is undoubtedly the age of humanityas far, at least, as England is concerned.
