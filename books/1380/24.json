{"id":21493,"no":24,"title":"CHAPTER IX. BIDDING HIGH.","content":"I hope to press all the necessary records of the next three or four months into a few pages. A few pages will be needed in order that we may know how old Mr. Bertram behaved when he heard of this rupture between his nephew and his granddaughter. George, when he found himself back in town, shut himself up in his chambers and went to work upon his manuscript. He, too, recognized the necessity of labour, in order that the sorrow within his heart might thus become dull and deadened. But it was deep, true sorrow—to him at some periods almost overwhelming: he would get up from his desk during the night, and throwing himself on the sofa, lie there writhing in his agony. While he had known that Caroline was his own, he had borne his love more patiently than does many a man of less intensity of feeling. He had been much absent from her; had not abridged those periods of absence as he might have done; had, indeed, been but an indifferent lover, if eagerness and empressement are necessary to a lover\u0027s character. But this had arisen from two causes, and lukewarmness in his love had not been either of them. He had been compelled to feel that he must wait for the fruition of his love; and therefore had waited. And then he had been utterly devoid of any feeling of doubt in her he loved. She had decided that they should wait. And so he had waited as secure away from her as he could have been with her. But his idea of a woman\u0027s love, of the purity and sanctity of her feelings, had been too high. He had left his betrothed to live without him, frequently without seeing him for months, and yet he had thought it utterly impossible that she should hold confidential intercourse with another man. We have seen how things fell out with him. The story need not be repeated. He was shocked, outraged, torn to the heart\u0027s core; but he loved as warmly, perhaps more warmly than ever. What he now expected it is impossible to describe; but during that first fortnight of seclusion in the midst of London, he did half expect, half hope that something would turn up. He waited and waited, still assuring himself that his resolve was inviolable, and that nothing should make him renew his engagement: and yet he hoped for something. There was a weight on his heart which then might have been removed. But no sign was made. We have seen how Adela, who felt for him, had striven in vain. No sign was made; and at the end of the fortnight he roused himself, shook his mane, and asked himself what he should do. In the first place, there should be no mystery. There were those among his friends to whom he had felt himself bound to speak of his engagement when it was made, and to them he felt himself bound to communicate the fact now that it was unmade. He wrote accordingly to Arthur Wilkinson; he wrote to Harcourt; and determined to go down to Hadley. He would have written also to his uncle, but he had never done so, and hardly knew how to commence a correspondence. His letter to Harcourt had been a difficult task to him, but at last it was finished in a very few words. He did not at all refer to what had taken place at Richmond, or allude in any way to the nature of the cause which had produced this sudden disrupture. He merely said that his engagement with Miss Waddington was broken off by mutual consent, and that he thought it best to let his friend know this in order that mistakes and consequent annoyance might be spared. This was very short; but, nevertheless, it required no little effort in its accomplishment. On the very next day Harcourt came to him at his chambers. This surprised him much. For though he had no intention of absolutely quarrelling with the rising legal luminary, he had taught himself to look upon any renewal of their real intimacy as out of the question. They were sailing on essentially different tacks in their life\u0027s voyages. They had become men of different views in everything. Their hours, their habits, their friends, their ways were in all things unlike. And then, moreover, Bertram no longer liked the successful barrister. It may be said that he had learned positively to dislike him. It was not that Harcourt had caused this wound which was tearing his heart to pieces; at least, he thought that it was not that. He declared to himself a dozen times that he did not blame Harcourt. He blamed no one but Caroline—her and himself. Nor was it because the man was so successful. Bertram certainly did not envy him. But the one as he advanced in manhood became worldly, false, laborious, exact, polished, rich, and agreeable among casual acquaintances. The other was the very reverse. He was generous and true; but idle—idle at any rate for any good; he was thoughtful, but cloudy in his thoughts, indifferent as to society, poor, much poorer than he had been as a lad at college, and was by no means gifted with the knack of making pretty conversation for the world at large. Of late whenever they had met, Harcourt had said something which grated painfully on the other\u0027s inner sensibilities, and hence had arisen this dislike. But the dislike seemed to be all on one side. Harcourt now was a man whose name was frequent in other men\u0027s mouths. Great changes were impending in the political world, and Harcourt was one of the men whom the world regarded as sure to be found swimming on the top of the troubled waters. The people of the Battersea Hamlets were proud of him, the House of Commons listened to him, suitors employed him, and men potent in the Treasury chambers, and men also who hoped to be potent there, courted and flattered him. All this made him busy; but, nevertheless, he found time to come to his dear friend. \"I am sorry for this; very sorry,\" he said, as he put out his hand in a manner that seemed to his friend to be almost patronizing. \"Can nothing be done?\" \"Nothing at all,\" said Bertram, rather curtly. \"Can I do nothing?\" said the cunning, legal man. \"Nothing at all,\" said Bertram, very curtly. \"Ah, I wish I could. I should be so happy to rearrange matters if it be at all possible.\" There are some men who are so specially good at rearranging the domestic disarrangements of others. \"It is an affair,\" said Bertram, \"which admits of no interference. Perhaps it is unnecessary that I should have troubled you on the matter at all, for I know that you are very busy; but—\" \"My dear fellow—busy, indeed! What business could be more important to me than my friend\u0027s happiness?\" \"But,\" continued George, \"as the affair had been talked over so often between you and me, I thought it right to tell you.\" \"Of course—of course; and so nothing can be done. Ah, well! it is very sad, very. But I suppose you know best. She is a charming girl. Perhaps, rather—\" \"Harcourt, I had rather not hear a word spoken about her in any way; but certainly not a word in her dispraise.\" \"Dispraise! no, certainly not. It would be much easier to praise her. I always admired her very much; very much indeed.\" \"Well, there\u0027s an end of it.\" \"So be it. But I am sorry, very sorry; heartily sorry. You are a little rough now, Bertram. Of course I see that you are so. Every touch goes against the hair with you; every little blow hits you on the raw. I can understand that; and therefore I do not mind your roughness. But we are old friends, you know. Each is perhaps the other\u0027s oldest friend; and I don\u0027t mean to lose such a friend because you have a shade of the misanthrope on you just now. You\u0027ll throw the bile off in another essay, rather more bitter than the last, and then you\u0027ll be all right.\" \"I\u0027m right enough now, thank you. Only a man can\u0027t always be in high spirits. At least, some men cannot.\" \"Well, God bless you, old fellow! I know you want me gone; so I\u0027ll go now. But never talk to me about my business. I do get through a good deal of business, but it shall never stand between you and me.\" And so the cunning legal man went his way. And then there remained the journey to Hadley. After that it was his purpose to go abroad again, to go to Paris, and live in dingy lodgings there au cinquième, to read French free-thinking books, to study the wild side of politics, to learn if he could, among French theatres and French morals, French freedom of action, and freedom of speech, and freedom of thought—France was a blessed country for freedom in those days, under the paternal monarchy of that paternal monarch, Louis Philippe—to learn to forget, among these sources of inspiration, all that he had known of the sweets of English life. But there remained the journey to Hadley. It had always been his custom to go to Mr. Pritchett in the city before he went to his uncle\u0027s house, and he did so now. Everybody who wished to see Mr. Bertram always went to Mr. Pritchett first, and Mr. Pritchett would usually send some avant-courier to warn his patron of the invasion. \"Ah, Mr. George,\" said Pritchett, wheezing, with his most melancholy sigh. \"You shouldn\u0027t have left the old gentleman so long, sir. Indeed you shouldn\u0027t.\" \"But he does not want to see me,\" said George. \"Think what a sight of money that is!\" continued Pritchett. \"One would really think, Mr. George, that you objected to money. There is that gentleman, your particular friend, you know, the member of Parliament. He is down there constantly, paying his respects, as he calls it.\" \"What, Mr. Harcourt?\" \"Yes, Mr. Harcourt. And he sends grapes in spring, and turkeys in summer, and green peas in winter.\" \"Green peas in winter! they must cost something.\" \"Of course they do; sprats to catch big fish with, Mr. George. And then the old gentleman has got a new lawyer; some sharp new light of Mr. Harcourt\u0027s recommending. Oh, Mr. George, Mr. George! do be careful, do now! Could not you go and buy a few ducks, or pigeons, and take them in a basket? The old gentleman does seem to like that kind of thing, though ten years since he was so different. Half a million of money, Mr. George! It\u0027s worth a few grapes and turkeys.\" And Mr. Pritchett shook his head and wrung his hands; for he saw that nothing he said produced any effect. George went to Hadley at last without ducks or pigeons, grapes or turkeys. He was very much amused however with the perpetual industry of his friend. \"Labor omnia vincit improbus\" said he to himself. \"It is possible that Harcourt will find my uncle\u0027s blind side at last.\" He found the old gentleman considerably changed. There were, occasionally, flashes of his former customary, sarcastic pungency; now and again he would rouse himself to be ill-natured, antagonistic, and self-willed. But old age and illness had sadly told upon him; and he was content for the most part to express his humour by little shrugs, shakes of the head, and an irritable manner he had lately acquired of rubbing his hands quickly together. \"Well, George,\" he said, when his nephew shook hands with him and asked after his health. \"I hope you are better than you were, sir. I was sorry to hear that you had been again suffering.\" \"Suffer, yes; a man looks to suffer when he gets to my age. He\u0027s a fool if he doesn\u0027t, at least. Don\u0027t trouble yourself to be sorry about it, George.\" \"I believe you saw my father not long since?\" Bertram said this, not quite knowing how to set the conversation going, so that he might bring in the tidings he had come there to communicate. \"Yes, I did,\" said Mr. Bertram senior; and his hands went to work as he sat in the arm-chair. \"Did you find him much altered since you last met? It was a great many years since, I believe?\" \"Not in the least altered. Your father will never alter.\" George now knew enough of his father\u0027s character to understand the point of this; so he changed the subject, and did that which a man who has anything to tell should always do at once; he commenced the telling of it forthwith. \"I have come down here, to-day, sir, because I think it right to let you know at once that Miss Waddington and I have agreed that our engagement shall be at an end.\" Mr. Bertram turned sharp round in his chair. \"What?\" said he. \"What?\" \"Our engagement is at an end. We are both aware that it is better for us it should be so.\" \"What do you mean? Better for you! How can it be better for you? You are two fools.\" \"Very likely, sir. We have been two fools; or, at any rate, I have been one.\" Mr. Bertram sat still in his chair, silent for a few moments. He still kept rubbing his hands, but in meditation rather than in anger. Though his back reached to the back of his chair, his head was brought forward and leaned almost on his chest. His cheeks had fallen in since George had seen him, and his jaw hung low, and gave a sad, thoughtful look to his face, in which also there was an expression of considerable pain. His nephew saw that what he had said had grieved him, and was sorry for it. \"George,\" he said, in a softer voice than had ever been usual with him. \"I wish you to marry Caroline. Go back to her, and make it up. Tell her that I wish it, if it be necessary to tell her anything.\" \"Ah, sir, I cannot do that. I should not have come to you now if there had been any room for doubt.\" \"There must be no room for doubt. This is nonsense; sheer nonsense. I shall send to Mary.\" George had never before heard him call Miss Baker by her Christian name. \"It cannot be helped, sir. Miss Baker can do nothing in the matter now; nor can any one else. We both know that the marriage would not suit us.\" \"Not suit you! nonsense. Two babies; two fools! I tell you it will suit you; it will suit me!\" Now had George Bertram junior not been an absolute ass, or a mole rather with no eyesight whatever for things above ground, he would have seen from this that he might not only have got back his love, but have made sure of being his uncle\u0027s heir into the bargain. At any rate, there was sufficient in what he said to insure him a very respectable share of those money-bags. How would Pritchett have rejoiced had he heard the old man speak so! and then how would he have sighed and wheezed when he saw the young man\u0027s indifference! But George would not take the hint. He must have been blind and dull, and dead and senseless. Who before had ever heard Mr. Bertram senior speak out in that way? \"It will suit me!\" And that from an old bachelor, with uncountable money-bags, to his only nephew! and such a request, too, as it conveyed—that he would again make himself agreeable to a beautiful girl whom he thoroughly loved, and by whom also he was thoroughly loved! But George was an ass, as we have said; and a mole, a blind mole; and a mule, a stiff-necked, stubborn mule. He would not yield an inch to his uncle; nor an inch to his own feelings. \"I am sorry to vex you, sir,\" he said, coldly, \"but it is impossible.\" \"Oh, very well,\" said the uncle, as he compressed his lips, and moved his hands. \"Very well.\" And so they parted. George went back to town and commenced his preparations for Paris. But on the following day he received the unwonted honour of a visit from Mr. Pritchett, and the honour was very pointed; in this wise. Mr. Pritchett, not finding him at home, had gone to a neighbouring tavern \"to get a bit of dinner,\" as he told the woman at the chambers; and stated, that he should go on calling till he did find Mr. George. And in this way, on his third or fourth visit, Mr. George was found. Mr. Pritchett was dressed in his best, and was very sad and solemn. \"Mr. George,\" said he, \"your uncle wishes to see you at Hadley, particular.\" \"Why, I was there yesterday.\" \"I know you was, Mr. George; and that\u0027s just it. Your uncle, Mr. George, is an old man, and it will be only dutiful you should be with him a good deal now. You\u0027d wish to be a comfort to your uncle in his last days. I know that, Mr. George. He\u0027s been good to you; and you\u0027ve your duty to do by him now, Mr. George; and you\u0027ll do it.\" So said Mr. Pritchett, having thoroughly argued the matter in his own mind, and resolved, that as Mr. George was a wilful young horse, who would not be driven in one kind of bridle, another must be tried with him. \"But has my uncle sent to say that he wants to see me again at once?\" \"He has, Mr. George; sent to say that he wants to see you again at once, particular.\" There was nothing of course for Mr. George to do but to obey, seeing that the order was so particular. On that same evening, therefore, he put his dressing-things into a bag, and again went down to Hadley. On his first arrival his uncle shook hands with him with much more than ordinary kindness, and even joked with him. \"So Pritchett came to you, did he? and sent you down at a moment\u0027s notice? ha! ha! He\u0027s a solemn old prig, is Pritchett; but a good servant; a very good servant. When I am gone, he\u0027ll have enough to live on; but he\u0027ll want some one to say a word to him now and again. Don\u0027t forget what I say about him. It\u0027s not so easy to find a good servant.\" George declared that he always had had, and would have, a regard for Mr. Pritchett; \"though I wish he were not quite so sad.\" \"Poor Pritchett! well; yes, he is sad,\" said the uncle, laughing; and then George went upstairs to get ready for dinner. The dinner, considering the house in which it was spread, was quite recherché. George said to himself that the fat fowls which he saw must have come from Harcourt\u0027s larder. Roast mutton and boiled beef—not together, but one on one day and the other on the next—generally constituted the fare at Mr. Bertram\u0027s house when he did not sit down to dinner alone. But now there was quite a little banquet. During dinner, he made sundry efforts to be agreeable; pressed his nephew to eat, and drank wine with him in the old-fashioned affectionate manner of past days. \"Your health, George,\" he said. \"You\u0027ll find that sherry good, I think. It ought to be, if years can make it so.\" It was good; and George was very sorry to find that the good wine had been brought out for him. He felt that something would be required in return, and that he could not give that something. After dinner that something was soon asked for. \"George,\" said the old man, \"I have been thinking much since you went away the other day about you and Caroline. I have taken it into my stupid old head to wish that you two should be married.\" \"Ah, sir!\" \"Now listen to me. I do wish it, and what you have said has disturbed me. Now I do believe this of you, that you are an honest lad; and though you are so fond of your own way, I don\u0027t think you\u0027d wish to grieve me if you could help it.\" \"Not if I could help it, sir; not if I could help it, certainly.\" \"You can help it. Now listen to me. An old man has no right to have his fancies unless he chooses to pay for them. I know that well enough. I don\u0027t want to ask you why you have quarrelled with Caroline. It\u0027s about money, very likely?\" \"No, sir, no; not in the least.\" \"Well, I don\u0027t want to inquire. A small limited income is very likely to lead to misunderstandings. You have at any rate been honest and true to me. You are not a bit like your father.\" \"Sir! sir!\" \"And, and—I\u0027ll tell you what I\u0027ll do. Caroline is to have six thousand pounds, isn\u0027t she?\" \"Pray believe me, sir, that money has nothing whatever to do with this matter.\" \"Yes, six,\" continued Mr. Bertram; \"four of her own, and two from me. Now I\u0027ll tell you what I\u0027ll do. Let me see. You have two hundred a year; that\u0027s settled on you. And you had a thousand pounds the other day. Is that all gone yet?\" \"I am in no want of money, uncle; none whatever.\" \"No, not as a bachelor; but as a married man you would be. Now do tell me—how much of that thousand pounds did the colonel get out of you?\" \"Dear uncle, do remember that he is my father.\" \"Well, well; two hundred a year, and two thousand pounds, and one, and Pritchett\u0027s account. I\u0027ll tell you what, George, I should like to see you comfortable; and if you and Caroline are married before next October, I\u0027ll give you—\" \"I can\u0027t tell you how you pain me, sir.\" \"I\u0027ll give you— I wonder how much income you think you\u0027ll want?\" \"None, sir; none. As our marriage is out of the question, we shall want no income. As I am, and am likely to remain unmarried, my present income is sufficient for me.\" \"I\u0027ll give you—let me see.\" And the old miser—for though capable of generosity to a great extent, as he had certainly shown with reference to his nephew\u0027s early years, he certainly was a miser—the old miser again recapitulated to himself all that he had already done, and tried to calculate at what smallest figure, at what lowest amount of ready money to be paid down, he could purchase the object which he now desired. \"I\u0027ll give you four thousand pounds on the day you are married. There, that will be ten thousand beside your own income, and whatever your profession will bring you.\" \"What am I to say, sir? I know how generous you are; but this is not an affair of money.\" \"What is it then?\" \"We should not be happy together.\" \"Not happy together! You shall be happy, I tell you; you will be happy if you have enough to live on. Remember, I may leave you something more than that when I die; that is, I may do so if you please me. You will understand, however, that I make no promise.\" \"Dear uncle,\" said George, and as he spoke he rose from his seat, and crossing over to his uncle, took the old man\u0027s hand in his own. \"You shall be asked for no promise; you shall be asked for nothing. You have been most liberal, most kind to me; too kind, I know, for I have not returned it by that attention which you deserved from me. But, believe me, I cannot do as you ask me. If you will speak to Miss Waddington, she will tell you the same.\" \"Miss Waddington! Pshaw!\" \"Caroline, I mean. It is impossible, sir. And it adds greatly to my own suffering—for I have suffered in all this—that you also should be grieved.\" \"Why, you were so much in love with her the other day! Mary told me that you were dying for her.\" \"I cannot explain it all. But she—Caroline—doubtless will. However, pray, pray take this for granted: the engagement between us cannot be renewed.\" Old Mr. Bertram still kept his nephew\u0027s hand, and it seemed as though he liked to hold it. He continued to look up into George\u0027s face as though striving to read there something different from the words which he heard, something which might yet give him some consolation. He had said that George was honest, and he believed it, as far as he could believe in honesty. But, nevertheless, he was still meditating at what price he could buy over his nephew to his purpose. After such a struggle as that of his whole lifetime, could he have any other faith but that money were omnipotent? No; this of course, this necessarily was his belief. As to the sufficient quantity—on that point it was possible for him to doubt. His nephew\u0027s manner to him was very touching; the tone of his voice, the look of his countenance, the grief which sat on his brow, did touch him. But they touched him in this manner; they made him feel that a few thousands were not sufficient. He had at last a desire at his heart, a family domestic warm desire; and he began to feel that if he were not prepared to give up his desire, he must bid high for its fulfilment. \"George,\" said he, \"after all, you and Caroline are the nearest relatives I have; the nearest and the dearest.\" \"Caroline is your own child\u0027s child, sir.\" \"She is but a girl; and it would all go to some spendthrift, whose very name would be different. And, I don\u0027t know, but I think I like you better than her. Look here now. According to my present will, nine-tenths of my property will go to build a hospital that shall bear my name. You\u0027ll not repeat that to anybody, will you?\" \"No, sir; I will not.\" \"If you\u0027ll do as I would have you about this marriage, I\u0027ll make a new will, and you and your children shall have— I\u0027ll let you say yourself how much you shall have; there—and you shall see the will yourself before the wedding takes place.\" \"What can I say to him? what can I say to him?\" said George, turning away his face. \"Sir, it is quite impossible. Is not that enough? Money has nothing to do with it; can have nothing to do with it.\" \"You don\u0027t think I\u0027d deceive you, do you, and make another will afterwards? It shall be a deed of gift if you like, or a settlement—to take effect of course after my death.\" On hearing this George turned away his face. \"You shall have half, George; there, by G—— you shall have half; settled on you—there—half of it, settled on you.\" And then only did the uncle drop his nephew\u0027s hand. He dropped it, and closing his eyes, began to meditate on the tremendous sacrifice he had made. There was something terrible in this to young Bertram. He had almost ceased to think of himself in watching his uncle\u0027s struggles. It was dreadful to see how terribly anxious the old man was, and more dreadful still to witness the nature of the thoughts which were running through his mind. He was making lavish tenders of his heaven, his god, his blessings; he was offering to part with his paradise, seeing that nature would soon imperatively demand that he should part with it. But useless as it must soon be to him, he could not bring himself to believe that it was not still all-powerful with others. \"Mr. Bertram, it is clearly necessary that we should understand each other,\" said George, with a voice that he intended should be firm, but which in truth was stern as well as firm. \"I thought it right to come and tell you that this match was broken off. But seeing that that has once been told, there is no longer room for further conversation on the matter. We have made up our minds to part; and, having done so, I can assure you that money can have no effect upon our resolution.\" \"Then you want it all—all!\" said the uncle, almost weeping. \"Not all, nor ten times all would move me one inch—not one inch,\" said George, in a voice that was now loud, and almost angry. Mr. Bertram turned towards the table, and buried his face in his hands. He did not understand it. He did not know whence came all this opposition. He could not conceive what was the motive power which caused his nephew thus to thwart and throw him over, standing forward as he did with thousands and tens of thousands in his hand. But he knew that his request was refused, and he felt himself degraded and powerless. \"Do not be angry with me, uncle,\" said the nephew. \"Go your own way, sir; go your own way,\" said the uncle. \"I have done with you. I had thought—but never mind—\" and he rang the bell violently. \"Sarah, I will go to bed—are my things ready? Woman, is my room ready, I say?\" and then he had himself led off, and George saw him no more that night. Nor did he see him the next morning; nor for many a long day afterwards. When the morning came, he sent in his love, with a hope that his uncle was better. Sarah, coming out with a long face, told George that his uncle had only muttered between his teeth—\"That it was nothing to him\"—to his nephew, namely—\"whether he were better or worse.\" And so, having received this last message, he went his way, and returned to town.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2741/75480.html","bookId":1380,"book":{"id":1380,"title":"The Bertrams","description":"简介： This is undoubtedly the age of humanityas far, at least, as England is concerned.
