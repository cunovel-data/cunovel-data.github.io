{"id":21483,"no":14,"title":"CHAPTER XIV. WAYS AND MEANS.","content":"On the following day Bertram returned to town. Now that he was a successful lover, and about to take upon himself at some future time the responsible duties of a married man, he became very energetic in the chambers of Mr. Die. He could hardly spare a day during the winter for running down to Littlebath, and whenever he did do so, he took Coke upon Lyttleton down with him. Nor did he work in vain. He never had worked in vain. Facility of acquiring the special knowledge which he sought had ever been one of his gifts. Mr. Die was already beginning to prophesy great things; and his friend Harcourt, who occasionally wanted his society, declared that he overdid his labours. Down at Littlebath they did not quite approve of all this industry. Caroline naturally thought that more of her lover\u0027s hours should be devoted to her; and Miss Baker, who looked on Mr. Bertram\u0027s money as certainly destined either for Caroline or George, considered that he was wasting his time with his fusty books. She had not dared to say much to George on this subject, and he had not taken very well the little that she did say. She could not tell him that Caroline was Mr. Bertram\u0027s granddaughter, but she did remind him that he himself was Mr. Bertram\u0027s nephew, and hinted that though a profession might be very eligible for a young man of such brilliant prospects, it could hardly be necessary for him absolutely to make a slave of himself. To this George had answered, somewhat curtly, that he had no reason to expect anything further from his uncle; and that as he looked forward to maintain himself and his wife by his successful exertions as a barrister, it was absolutely necessary that he should at present work very hard. \"I have lost a whole year,\" he said to Miss Baker; \"and nothing but very sharp work can atone for that.\" He never once saw his uncle after his first visit to Littlebath till the next year was far advanced. He felt no desire to see him, and certainly no wish to be the bearer of tidings as to his own engagement. Miss Baker had undertaken to do this, and might do so if she so pleased. As far as he was concerned, he had no idea of asking permission to marry from any one. \"Why should I ask him,\" he had once said to Miss Baker. \"I shall marry just the same, whether he permits it or whether he does not.\" This was grievous to the ladies at Littlebath. Very little had been said about money between George and Miss Baker up to this time; nothing had been said between George and Caroline; but the two ladies knew that there could be no marriage till there was an adequate income. The income of the gentleman when stripped of his fellowship would be two hundred pounds a year; that of the lady was about the same. Now Caroline Waddington had no intention whatever of marrying on four hundred pounds a year; and it must be more than three years at the very least before all this profound study would result in golden fees. Now that the matter was so far settled—settled as Bertram considered it—he did tell Harcourt of his love. \"Harcourt,\" said he, one day. \"I have a piece of news which perhaps I ought to tell you. I am engaged to be married.\" \"Are you?\" said Harcourt, rather too coolly to satisfy his friend\u0027s expectation. \"I am not joking.\" \"Who ever accused you of joking since you took to the law and Mr. Die? I did not give you credit for a joke; not even for so bad a one as that would be. Shall I congratulate or condole with you?\" \"Either or neither. Perhaps you had better wait till you see the lady.\" \"And when is it to be?\" \"Well; in this coming summer, I suppose. That is my wish, at least.\" \"And your wish of course will be law. I presume then that I may be justified in surmising that the lady has some considerable fortune?\" \"No, indeed, she has not. Something she has got; about as much, perhaps, as myself. We shall have bread to eat.\" \"And occasionally cheese,\" said Harcourt, who could not understand that any rising man could marry early, unless in doing so he acquired money. \"And occasionally cheese,\" repeated Bertram. \"This is a state of things that would not suit your book, I know.\" \"Not exactly,\" said Harcourt. \"But men have very different ideas about women. I could do, and have done, and am doing with a small income myself; but a wife is in some respects like a horse. If a gentleman does keep a horse, it should be well groomed.\" \"You could not endure a woman who was not always got up in satin and velvet?\" \"Not satin and velvet exactly. I do not require a curiously-mounted saddle for my horse. But I don\u0027t think I should have much enjoyment with a cheap wife. I like cold mutton and candle-ends myself very well, but I do not love feminine economies. Family washing-bills kept at the lowest, a maid-of-all-work with an allowance in lieu of beer, and a dark morning gown for household work, would not, if I know myself, add fuel to the ardour of my conjugal affection. I love women dearly; I like them to be near me; but then I like them to be nice. When a woman is nasty, she is very nasty.\" Bertram said in his heart that Harcourt was a beast, an animal without a soul, a creature capable of no other joys than those of a material nature; but he kept this opinion at the present moment to himself. Not, however, that he was averse to express himself openly before his friend. He often gave Harcourt to understand that he suspected him of being deficient in the article of a soul; and Harcourt would take the reproach with perfect good-humour, remarking, perhaps, that he might probably find it possible to get on decently without one. \"Is the lady\u0027s name a secret?\" he asked. \"No; not to you, at least. I believe it is generally considered advisable that these sort of things should not be talked about quite openly till the consummation of them is nigh at hand. I have no wish for any mystery in the matter. Her name is Caroline Waddington.\" \"What! a daughter of Sir Augustus?\" \"No; nothing to Sir Augustus, that I have heard.\" \"She must, then, be one of the General\u0027s family?\" \"Not that either. Her only relative, that I know, is a Miss Baker.\" \"Miss Baker!\" said Harcourt; and the tone of his voice was not encouraging. \"Yes, Miss Baker,\" said Bertram; and the tone of his voice was hardly conciliatory. \"Oh—ah—yes. I don\u0027t exactly think I know her. Miss Baker!\" \"It would be odd if you did, for she lives at Littlebath, and hardly ever comes to town. When she does, she stays down at Hadley with my uncle.\" \"Oh—h! That\u0027s a horse of another colour. I beg your pardon entirely, my dear fellow. Why did you not tell me at first that this is a match of your uncle\u0027s making?\" \"My uncle\u0027s making! It is not a match of my uncle\u0027s making.\" \"Well, well; one that he approves. I hardly gave you credit for so much prudence. That will be as good as having everything settled exactly as you could wish it.\" \"You are giving me a great deal too much credit,\" said Bertram, laughing. \"My uncle knows nothing about my marriage, and I have not the slightest idea of consulting him. I should think it mean to do so, considering everything.\" \"Mean to consult the only relative you have who can do anything for you?\" \"Yes. He has told me over and over again that I have no claim on him; and, therefore, I will make none.\" Bertram had said to himself frequently that he cared nothing for this man\u0027s judgment in such matters; but, nevertheless, after what had passed, he did desire that Harcourt should see Caroline. He was aware, judging rather from Harcourt\u0027s tone than from his words, that that keen-sighted friend of his had but a low opinion of Miss Waddington; that he thought that she was some ordinary, intriguing girl, who had been baiting a hook for a husband, after the manner which scandal states to be so common among the Littlebathians; and Bertram longed, therefore, to surprise his eyes and astound his intellect with a view of her charms and a near knowledge of her attributes. Nothing should be said of her beauty, and the blaze of it should fall upon him altogether unprepared. George was right in his feelings in this respect. Harcourt had formed a very false idea of Miss Waddington;—had led himself to imagine that she was second-rate and unattractive. In the first place, he had his own ideas about Littlebath, and conceived that it was not the place in which the highest beauty of England should be looked for; and in the next place, he knew George Bertram, and regarded him as a man peculiarly liable to such dangers as these. \"You must come down with me to Littlebath. When will you give me a day?\" Harcourt demurred, as he did not wish to be called on imperiously to praise a woman of whom he knew he should disapprove, and endeavoured to excuse himself from the journey. But Bertram persisted, and at last it was settled that he would go down. This did not happen till towards the end of winter. Miss Baker had, as she promised, seen Mr. Bertram in the meantime, and the answer returned from the Hadley oracle had, like most oracle-answers, been neither favourable nor unfavourable. Mr. Bertram had expressed no great anger at the tale of love that was told him; but neither had he expressed any gratification. \"Well,\" he had said, \"it is odd that they should have come together; very odd. He is a clever young man, and I dare say may do well.\" Miss Baker had then ventured, but in a very modest way, to ask him his opinion as to the sufficiency of the young people\u0027s income. \"They must judge of that themselves,\" he had said, rather sharply. \"But I suppose they have no idea of marrying as yet. They mean to wait, don\u0027t they, till he begins his profession?\" To this Miss Baker had made no answer, and nothing further had been said at that meeting. Early in March, Miss Baker had again seen the great man. She had then ventured to explain to him that George was working very hard. \"Ah! you have his word for that, I suppose,\" said the uncle; \"but if so, believe me he will get on at such work as that quicker without a wife than he will with one.\" But at this interview Miss Baker did ask him plainly, as had been agreed beforehand between her and her niece that she should do, whether he would on their marriage make any increase to his granddaughter\u0027s fortune. \"She has a liberal, ladylike provision,\" said he. \"But they will not have enough to live on,\" said Miss Baker. \"They will have a third more, Mary, than I had when I married your aunt. And yet I saved money on my income.\" \"But remember how they have been brought up, sir.\" \"If they will be fine ladies and gentlemen, they must take the penalties of being so. Fine ladies and gentlemen cannot marry at a moment\u0027s notice, as do ploughboys and milkmaids. If they cannot live on a limited income, they must wait.\" He did, however, on this occasion go so far as to say, that if they would wait for another twelvemonth, and that if he were then living, he would add two thousand pounds to Caroline\u0027s fortune. As to George, he had done as much as he intended to do—certainly for the present. \"George likes his own way,\" said the old man, \"and as far as I am concerned, he shall have it. It will be well for him to make his own career in the world; he will be happier so than in spending my money.\" On this occasion Miss Baker was permitted to tell Caroline all the circumstances of her parentage and grandparentage. The same story might now be told to George. But they were both to be cautioned that their relative\u0027s displeasure would be incurred by any useless repetition of it. \"And, Mary,\" said he, \"do not let them mislead themselves. Do not let them marry with the idea that by so doing they will inherit between them my money. I wish them both to understand that my views are altogether different.\" Miss Baker, when she returned to Littlebath, could not think that she had been successful in her mission; and Caroline immediately declared that any idea of a marriage for that year, or even for the next, must now be altogether out of the question. She was very much startled at hearing that Mr. Bertram was her mother\u0027s father, but did not pretend to any suddenly intense affection for him. \"If that be so,\" said she, coldly, \"if George and I are his only near connections, and if he does not disapprove of our marriage, he ought to give us an income on which we can live.\" It is astonishing how different are the views of grandfathers and grandchildren on such matters! Unfortunately there was no unanimity of opinion on this matter, either between the lovers themselves or between them and their aunt. George was of opinion that they should marry immediately on their present income, and trust to Providence and his exertions for a future increase. For one year he would have the income of his fellowship; in two years and a half he would be called; and in the meantime, he could make something by the Magazines. If Caroline was not afraid, he was not. But Caroline was very much afraid. It had by no means formed part of the project of her life to live in London as a married woman on four hundred pounds a year. \"She knew,\" she said to Miss Baker, \"what effect that would have on her husband\u0027s affections.\" She seemed, indeed, to share some of Harcourt\u0027s opinions on the subject, and to have a dislike to feminine economies, or at least to the use of them under the surveillance of a man\u0027s eye. As far as she could see, the marriage must be postponed indefinitely—at any rate, till after George should have been called to the bar. Miss Baker\u0027s voice was for a middle course. She suggested that they should wait for Mr. Bertram\u0027s two thousand pounds and then marry. They would then have an income increased to some extent. They would also show a deference to the old man\u0027s views, which would undoubtedly—so Miss Baker thought—have ultimate results of a most beneficial nature. \"After all,\" as she remarked more than once to her niece, \"who else is there?\" But the young people were quite as obstinate as the old man. George would make no concession whatever to his uncle. He was ready to marry on love and a small income, and he expected Caroline to show an equal warmth. Caroline would by no means alter her views, or risk the misery of an ill-provided nursery. It had been the one great resolve of her life, that she would not be a poor man\u0027s wife. \"She was ready to wait,\" she said. \"If she could trust and wait, surely George might do so. A man, with all the world around him, encountered neither the misery nor the risk in waiting that fell to a girl\u0027s lot.\" The disputes incidental to these different opinions did not ever take place between George and Caroline. He, from a feeling of chivalry, abstained from discussing money matters with her; and she, from a feeling of prudence, was equally silent with him. Poor Miss Baker was the medium for it all. George of course would press with a lover\u0027s ardour for an early day; and Caroline would of course say that an immediate marriage was, she found, impracticable. And then each would refer the other to Miss Baker. Things went on in this way till the middle of May. Sometimes George was almost angry, and wrote letters that were somewhat savage; sometimes Caroline would be haughty, and then she too could write letters which would tell her mind in good plain set terms. But they were not near enough, or sufficiently often with each other, to quarrel. So matters went on till May; and then, on one fine May-day, Harcourt and George together took their places in the train for Littlebath. \"I wonder what you\u0027ll think of her?\" said George. \"Of course you\u0027ll tell the truth?\" \"Oh, of course,\" said Harcourt, with his mind duly made up to praise her. \"You haven\u0027t the pluck to find fault with her,\" said George; \"you would be afraid not to call her handsome, even if you thought her as ugly as Hecate.\" \"Exactly,\" said Harcourt; \"and therefore these little experimentary trips are never of any use.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2741/75470.html","bookId":1380,"book":{"id":1380,"title":"The Bertrams","description":"简介： This is undoubtedly the age of humanityas far, at least, as England is concerned.
