{"id":21471,"no":2,"title":"CHAPTER II. BREAKFAST AND LUNCH.","content":"Wilkinson took the pen in his hand and bent himself over the paper as though he were going to write; but not an ink-mark fell upon the paper. How should he write it? The task might have been comparatively light to him but for that dreadful debt. Bertram in the meantime tossed over the pages of his book, looking every now and then at his watch; and then turning sharply round, he exclaimed, \"Well!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I wish you\u0027d leave me,\" said Wilkinson; \"I\u0027d rather be alone.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"May I be doomed to live and die a don if I do; which style of life, next to that of an English bishop, I look on as the most contemptible in the world. The Queen\u0027s royal beef-eaters come next; but that, I think, I could endure, as their state of do-nothingness is not so absolute a quantity. Come; how far have you got? Give me the paper, and I\u0027ll write you a letter in no time.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Thank you; I\u0027d rather write my own letter.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s just what I want you to do, but you won\u0027t;\" and then again he turned for two minutes to the \"Frogs.\" \"Well—you see you don\u0027t write. Come, we\u0027ll both have a try at it, and see who\u0027ll have done first. I wonder whether my father is expecting a letter from me?\" And, so saying, he seized hold of pen and paper and began to write. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n My dearest Father, \\n\\n \\n\\n This weary affair is over at last. You will be sorry to hear that the event is not quite as well as it might have been as far as I am concerned. I had intended to be a first, and, lo! I am only a second. If my ambition had been confined to the second class, probably I might have come out a first. I am very sorry for it, chiefly for your sake; but in these days no man can count on the highest honours as a certainty. As I shall be home on Tuesday, I won\u0027t say any more. I can\u0027t give you any tidings about the fellowships yet. Bertram has had his old luck again. He sends his love to mamma and the girls. \\n\\n \\n\\n Your very affectionate son, \\n\\n \\n\\n Arthur Wilkinson. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There, scribble that off; it will do just as well as anything else.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Poor Wilkinson took the paper, and having read it, to see that it contained no absurdity, mechanically copied the writing. He merely added one phrase, to say that his friend\u0027s \"better luck\" consisted in his being the only double-first of his year, and one short postscript, which he took good care that Bertram should not see; and then he fastened his letter and sent it to the post. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Tell mamma not to be very unhappy.\" That was the postscript which he added. \\n\\n \\n\\n That letter was very anxiously expected at the vicarage of Hurst Staple. The father was prepared to be proud of his successful son; and the mother, who had over and over again cautioned him not to overwork himself, was anxious to know that his health was good. She had but little fear as to his success; her fear was that he should come home thin, pale, and wan. \\n\\n \\n\\n Just at breakfast-time the postman brought the letter, and the youngest girl running out on to the gravel brought it up to her expectant father. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It is from Arthur,\" said she; \"isn\u0027t it, papa? I\u0027m sure I know his handwriting.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The vicar, with a little nervousness, opened it, and in half a minute the mother knew that all was not right. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Is he ill?\" said she; \"do tell me at once.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ill! no; he\u0027s not ill.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, what is it? He has not lost his degree?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He has not been plucked, papa, has he?\" said Sophia. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, no; he has got his degree—a second in classics!—that\u0027s all;\" and he threw the letter over to his wife as he went on buttering his toast. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He\u0027ll be home on Tuesday,\" said Mary, the eldest girl, looking over her mother\u0027s shoulder. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And so George is a double-first,\" said Mrs. Wilkinson. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes,\" said the vicar, with his mouth full of toast; not evincing any great satisfaction at the success of his late pupil. \\n\\n \\n\\n When the mother read the short postscript her heart was touched, and she put her handkerchief up to her face. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Poor Arthur! I am sure it has not been his own fault.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mamma, has George done better than Arthur?\" said one of the younger girls. \"George always does do better, I think; doesn\u0027t he?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He has made himself too sure of it,\" said the father, in almost an angry tone. Not that he was angry; he was vexed, rather, as he would be if his wheat crop failed, or his potatoes did not come up properly. \\n\\n \\n\\n But he felt no sympathy with his son. It never occurred to him to think of the agony with which those few lines had been written; of the wretchedness of the young heart which had hoped so much and failed so greatly; of the misery which the son felt in disappointing the father. He was a good, kind parent, who spent his long days and longer nights in thinking of his family and their welfare; he would, too, have greatly triumphed in the triumph of his son; but it went beyond his power of heart to sympathize with him in his misery. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Do not seem to be vexed with him when he comes home,\" said the mother. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Vexed with him! you mean angry. Of course, I\u0027m not angry. He has done his best, I suppose. It\u0027s unlucky, that\u0027s all.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And then the breakfast was continued in silence. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know what he\u0027s to do,\" said the father, after awhile; \"he\u0027ll have to take a curacy, I suppose.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I thought he meant to stop up at Oxford and take pupils,\" said Mary. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know that he can get pupils now. Besides, he\u0027ll not have a fellowship to help him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Won\u0027t he get a fellowship at all, papa?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Very probably not, I should think.\" And then the family finished their meal in silence. \\n\\n \\n\\n It certainly is not pleasant to have one\u0027s hopes disappointed; but Mr. Wilkinson was hardly just in allowing himself to be so extremely put about by his son\u0027s failure in getting the highest honours. Did he remember what other fathers feel when their sons are plucked? or, did he reflect that Arthur had, at any rate, done much better than nineteen out of every twenty young men that go up to Oxford? But then Mr. Wilkinson had a double cause for grief. Had George Bertram failed also, he might perhaps have borne it better. \\n\\n \\n\\n As soon as the letter had been written and made up, Wilkinson suffered himself to be led out of the room. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And now for Parker\u0027s,\" said Bertram; \"you will be glad to see Harcourt.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Indeed, I shall not. Harcourt\u0027s all very well; but just at present, I would much rather see nobody.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, then, he\u0027ll be glad to see you; and that will be quite the same thing. Come along.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Harcourt was a young barrister but lately called to the bar, who had been at Oxford spending his last year when Bertram and Wilkinson were freshmen; and having been at Bertram\u0027s college, he had been intimate with both of them. He was now beginning to practise, and men said that he was to rise in the world. In London he was still a very young man; but at Oxford he was held to be one who, from his three years\u0027 life in town, had become well versed in the world\u0027s ways. He was much in the habit of coming to Oxford, and when there usually spent a good deal of his time with George Bertram. \\n\\n \\n\\n And so Wilkinson walked forth into the street arm and arm with his cousin. It was a grievous trial to him; but he had a feeling within him that the sooner the sorrow was encountered the sooner it would be over. They turned into the High Street, and as they went they met crowds of men who knew them both. Of course it was to be expected that Bertram\u0027s friends should congratulate him. But this was not the worst; some of them were so ill advised as to condole with Wilkinson. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Get it over at once,\" whispered Bertram to him, \"and then it will be over, now and for ever.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And then they arrived at Parker\u0027s, and there found all those whom Bertram had named, and many others. Mr. Parker was, it is believed, a pastrycook by trade; but he very commonly dabbled in more piquant luxuries than jam tarts or Bath buns. Men who knew what was what, and who were willing to pay—or to promise to pay—for their knowledge, were in the habit of breakfasting there, and lunching. Now a breakfast or a lunch at Parker\u0027s generally meant champagne. \\n\\n \\n\\n Harcourt was seated on the table when they got into the back room, and the other men were standing. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Sound the timbrels, beat the drums; \\n\\n See the conqu\u0027ring hero comes,\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n he sung out as Bertram entered the room. \"Make way for the double-first—the hero of the age, gentlemen! I am told that they mean to put up an alabaster statue to him in the Common Room at Trinity. However, I will vote for nothing more expensive than marble.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Make it in pie-crust,\" said Bertram, \"and let Parker be the artist.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes; and we\u0027ll celebrate the installation with champagne and paté de foie gras,\" said Twisleton. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And afterwards devour the object of our idolatry, to show how short-lived is the fame for which we work so hard,\" said Madden. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I should be delighted at such tokens of your regard, gentlemen. Harcourt, you haven\u0027t seen Wilkinson.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Harcourt turned round and shook hands warmly with his other friend. \"Upon my word, I did not see you, Master Wilkinson. You have such a habit of hiding yourself under a bushel that one always misses you. Well; so the great day is over, and the great deed done. It\u0027s a bore out of the way, trampled under foot and got rid of; that\u0027s my idea of a degree.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Wilkinson merely smiled; but Harcourt saw at once that he was a deeply-disappointed man. The barrister, however, was too much a man of the world either to congratulate him or condole with him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There are fewer firsts this year than there have been for the last nine years,\" said Gerard, thinking to soften the asperity of Wilkinson\u0027s position. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That may be because the examiners required more, or because the men had less to give,\" said Madden, forgetting all about Wilkinson. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why, what noodles you are,\" said Bertram, \"not to know that it\u0027s all settled by chance at roulette the night before the lists come down! If it\u0027s not, it ought to be. The average result would be just as fair. Come, Harcourt, I know that you, with your Temple experiences, won\u0027t drink Oxford wine; but your good nature will condescend to see the children feeding. Wilkinson, sit opposite there and give Twisleton some of that pie that he was talking of.\" And so they sat down to their banquet; and Harcourt, in spite of the refinement which London had doubtless given to his taste, seemed perfectly able to appreciate the flavour of the University vintage. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Gentlemen, silence for one moment,\" said Harcourt, when the graver work of eating began to lull, and men torpidly peeled their pears, and then cut them up into shapes instead of eating them. \"It is always said at all the breakfasts I go to—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"This is not a breakfast,\" said Bertram, \"it\u0027s a lunch.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, all the lunches, then; and God bless you. It\u0027s always said at these matutinal meals—which, by-the-by, would be the nicest things in the world, only one doesn\u0027t know what on earth to do when they\u0027re over.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It\u0027s time to go to dinner then,\" said Twisleton. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That may do for the \u0027dura ilia\u0027 of a freshman, but now that you\u0027re a B.A., you\u0027ll find that that power fails you greatly. But, for heaven\u0027s sake, let me go on with my speech, or you\u0027ll not get away either to dinner or to supper. It is commonly declared, I say, that there should be no speaking at these delicious little morning repasts.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Do you call that a little repast?\" said Madden, who was lying back in his chair with a cigar in his mouth, of which he hardly had strength enough left to puff out the smoke. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I mean no offence to the feed, which, of its kind, has been only too good. If I\u0027m to be allowed to go on, I\u0027ll say, that this rule, which is always laid down, is always broken; and therefore I feel no hesitation in breaking it on this occasion. A long speech is a long bore, and a little speech is a little bore; but bores must be endured. We can\u0027t do very well without them. Now my bore shall be a very short bore if I\u0027m allowed to make an end of it without interruption.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"All right, Harcourt,\" said Bertram. \"Go ahead; we\u0027re only too delighted to hear you. It isn\u0027t every day we have a London barrister here.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No; and it isn\u0027t every day that we have a double-first at old Trinity. Gentlemen, there are, I think, five, six Trinity men here including myself. It will be a point of honour with you to drink health and prosperity to our friend Bertram with all the honours. We have many men of whom we can boast at Trinity; but if I have any insight into character, any power of judging what a man will do\"—it must be remembered that Mr. Harcourt, though a very young man in London, was by no means a young man at Oxford—\"there have been very few before him who have achieved a higher place than will fall to his lot, or whose name will be more in men\u0027s mouths than his. There are also here four gentlemen of other colleges; they will not, I am sure, begrudge us our triumph; they are his old friends, and will be as proud of the Oxford man as we are of the Trinity man. Gentlemen, here is prosperity to our friend the double-first, and health to enjoy the fruits of his labour.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Whereupon the toast was drunk with a great deal of fervour. It was astonishing that ten men should make so much uproar; even Wilkinson, whose heart the wine had just touched sufficiently to raise it a little from the depth to which it had fallen—even he cheered; and Madden, overcoming by degrees his not unnatural repugnance to rise, produced from certain vast depths a double-bass hurrah. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Bertram,\" said he, when the voices and glasses were once more silent, \"you\u0027re a credit to your college, and I\u0027ve a regard for you; so I don\u0027t mind running the risk for once. But I must beg that I may not be asked to repeat it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Bertram of course returned thanks to his guests with all the mawkish modesty which usually marks such speeches—or, rather, with modesty which would be mawkish were it not so completely a matter of course. And then he sat down; and then, with a face rather heightened in colour, he got upon his legs again. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"In spite of Madden\u0027s difficulty of utterance,\" said he, \"and his very visible disinclination to move—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m not going to do any more shouting,\" said Madden, \"even though you propose the health of the chancellor, vice-chancellor, and two members.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not even though he throws the proctor\u0027s into the bargain,\" said Twisleton. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You may shout or not as you like; but at the risk of giving some temporary pain to as good a friend as I have in the world, I will ask you to drink the health of one whom on this occasion fortune has not favoured—I mean my cousin, Arthur Wilkinson. The lists as they come down are, I dare say, made out with tolerable fairness. It is not at any rate for me to grumble at them. But of this I am quite sure, that did there exist some infallible test for finding out the best man, no man\u0027s name in this year would have been placed before his. He is not so jovial as the rest of us now, because he has partly failed; but the time will come when he will not fail.\" And then Arthur Wilkinson\u0027s health was toasted with a somewhat bated enthusiasm, but still with sufficient éclat to make every glass in Mr. Parker\u0027s house ring on its shelf. \\n\\n \\n\\n Poor Wilkinson\u0027s ears tingled when he heard his name pronounced; and he would at the moment have given anything to be allowed to be quiet. But it may be doubted whether he would not have been more hurt had he been left there without any notice. It is very hard to tune oneself aright to a disappointed man. \"I\u0027ll break the ice for him, at any rate,\" said Bertram to himself. \"When he\u0027s used to talk about it, he will suffer less.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Wilkinson had been accounted a good hand at speaking in the debating society, and though rather more prolix than Bertram, and not quite so vivacious, had been considered almost more than a match for his cousin on account of his superior erudition and more practised delivery; but now his voluble gift of words deserted him. \"He was much obliged to them,\" he said; \"though perhaps, on the whole, it was better that men who placed themselves in a mediocre condition should be left to their mediocrity. He had no doubt himself of the justness of the lists. It would be useless for him to say that he had not aspired; all the world\"—it was all the world to him—\"knew too well that he had aspired. But he had received a lesson which might probably be useful to him for the rest of his life. As for failing, or not failing, that depended on the hopes which a man might form for himself. He trusted that his would henceforth be so moderate in their nature as to admit of a probability of their being realized.\" Having uttered these very lugubrious words, and almost succeeded in throwing a wet blanket over the party, he sat down. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Now, you\u0027re not going to do anybody else, are you?\" said Madden. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Only Twisleton, and Gerard, and Hopgood,\" answered Bertram; \"and Fortescue looks as if he expected it. Perhaps, however, he\u0027ll let us off till the day after to-morrow.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And then, with a round of milk punch, another cigar apiece, and a little more chat, the party broke up. \\n\\n \\n\\n Bertram and Harcourt remained together, and Bertram endeavoured to induce Wilkinson to stay with them. He, however, wished to be alone, and got home to his college by himself. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You always overrated that man,\" said Harcourt. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I think not; but time will show. After all, a good degree is not everything in the world. Who in London cares about senior wranglers and double-firsts? When all is done, I don\u0027t see the use of it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Nobody cares much about wranglers and double-firsts; but these are the men, nevertheless, who get the best of what\u0027s going. Wood that will swim in one water will swim in all waters.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027ll find Wilkinson will swim yet.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That is, he won\u0027t sink. I don\u0027t say he will. Nine-tenths of the men in the world neither swim nor sink; they just go along with their bows above the wave, but dreadfully water-logged, barely able to carry the burdens thrown on them; but yet not absolutely sinking; fighting a hard fight for little more than mere bread, and forgetting all other desires in their great desire to get that. When such a man does get bread, he can\u0027t be said to sink.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ah! Wilkinson will do more than that.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Something more, or something less, as the case may be. But, believe me, he is not the man to make other men fall before him. Industry alone never does that, and certainly not that sort of industry which breaks down once in every six months. But come, Mr. Parker\u0027s champagne makes my head buzz: let us take a walk up the river; Twisleton\u0027s idea of going to dinner requires far too much pluck for me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And so they walked out along the towing-path, discussing many things of much importance to them. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There is a tide in the affairs of men \\n\\n Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n In nine cases out of ten, this flood-tide comes but once in life, and then in early years. A man may have a second or a third chance for decent maintenance, but hardly a second chance for fortune\u0027s brighter favours. The horse that is to win the race needs not make all his best running at once; but he that starts badly will rarely do so. When a young man discusses what shall be his future walk in life, he is talking of all that concerns his success as far as this world is concerned. And it is so hard for a youth to know, to make even a fair guess, as to what his own capacities are! The right man is wanted in the right place; but how is a lad of two and twenty to surmise what place will be right for him? And yet, if he surmises wrong, he fails in taking his tide at its single flood. How many lawyers are there who should have been soldiers! how many clergymen who should have been lawyers! how many unsuccessful doctors who might have done well on \u0027Change, or in Capel Court! \\n\\n \\n\\n Bertram had an inkling of this; and Harcourt had more than an inkling. His path in life was chosen, and he had much self-confidence that he had chosen it well. He had never doubted much, and since he had once determined had never doubted at all. He had worked hard, and was prepared to work hard; not trusting over much in his own talents, but trusting greatly in his own industry. But Bertram, with double his friend\u0027s genius, had, at any rate as yet, but little of his friend\u0027s stability. To him the world was all before him where to choose; but he was sadly in want of something that should guide his choice. He had a high, but at the same time a vague ambition. The law, the church, letters, art, and politics all enticed him; but he could not decide of which mistress the blandishments were the sweetest. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, when shall we have you up in London?\" said Harcourt. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"In London! I don\u0027t know that I shall go to London. I shall go down to Hadley for a few weeks of course\"—Bertram\u0027s uncle lived at the village of that name, in the close vicinity of Barnet—\"but what I shall do then, I don\u0027t in the least know.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But I know you\u0027ll come to London and begin to keep your terms.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What, at the Middle Temple?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"At some Temple or some Inn: of course you won\u0027t go where anybody else goes; so probably it will be Gray\u0027s Inn.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, I shall probably do a much more commonplace thing; come back here and take orders.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Take orders! You! You can no more swallow the thirty-nine articles than I can eat Twisleton\u0027s dinner.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"A man never knows what he can do till he tries. A great deal of good may be done by a clergyman if he be in earnest and not too much wedded to the Church of England. I should have no doubt about it if the voluntary principle were in vogue.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"A voluntary fiddlestick!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, even a voluntary fiddlestick—if it be voluntary and well used.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Of course you\u0027ll be a barrister. It is what you are cut out for, and what you always intended.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It is the most alluring trade going, I own;—but then they are all such rogues. Of course you will be an exception.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I shall do at Rome as Romans do—I hope always. My doctrine is, that we have no immutable law of right and wrong.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"A very comfortable code. I wish I could share it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, you will some of these days; indeed, you do now practically. But the subject is too long to talk of here. But as I know you won\u0027t go into the church, I expect to see you settled in London before Christmas.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What am I to live on, my dear fellow?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Like all good nephews, live on your uncle. Besides, you will have your fellowship; live on that, as I do.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You have more than your fellowship; and as for my uncle, to tell you the truth, I have no fancy for living on him. I am not quite sure that he doesn\u0027t mean me to think that it\u0027s charity. However, I shall have the matter out with him now.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Have the matter out with him!—and charity! What an ass you are! An uncle is just the same as a father.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"My uncle is not the same to me as my father.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No; and by all accounts it\u0027s lucky for you that he is not. Stick to your uncle, my dear fellow, and come up to London. The ball will be at your foot.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Did you ever read Marryat\u0027s novel, Harcourt?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What, Peter Simple?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, that other one: I think of going out as another Japhet in search of a father. I have a great anxiety to know what mine\u0027s like. It\u0027s fourteen years now since I saw him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He is at Teheran, isn\u0027t he?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"At Hong Kong, I think, just at present; but I might probably catch him at Panama; he has something to do with the isthmus there.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You wouldn\u0027t have half the chance that Japhet had, and would only lose a great deal of time. Besides, if you talk of means, that would want money.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n They were now walking back towards Oxford, and had been talking about fifty indifferent subjects, when Bertram again began. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"After all, there\u0027s only one decent career for a man in England.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And what is the one decent career?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Politics and Parliament. It\u0027s all very well belonging to a free nation, and ruling oneself, if one can be one of the rulers. Otherwise, as far as I can see, a man will suffer less from the stings of pride under an absolute monarch. There, only one man has beaten you in life; here, some seven hundred and fifty do so,—not to talk of the peers.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, but then a fellow has some chance of being one of the seven hundred and fifty.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I shall go in for that, I think; only who the deuce will return me? How does a man begin? Shall I send my compliments to the electors of Marylebone, and tell them that I am a very clever fellow?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Exactly; only do something first to show that you are so. I mean also to look to that; but I shall be well contented if I find myself in the house in twenty years\u0027 time,—or perhaps in thirty.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ah, you mean as a lawyer.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How else should a man without property get into Parliament?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That\u0027s just what I want to know. But I have no idea, Harcourt, of waiting twenty years before I make my start in life. A man at any rate may write a book without any electors.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, but not have it read. The author who does any good must be elected by suffrages at least as honestly obtained as those of a member of Parliament.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2741/75458.html","bookId":1380,"book":{"id":1380,"title":"The Bertrams","description":"简介： This is undoubtedly the age of humanityas far, at least, as England is concerned.
