{"id":21478,"no":9,"title":"CHAPTER IX. MISS TODD\u0027S PICNIC.","content":"That matter of obtaining permission for Sir Lionel to join the picnic was not found difficult of arrangement. Good-looking, pleasant-mannered Sir Lionels, who bear the Queen\u0027s commission, and have pleasant military ways with them, are welcome enough at such parties as these, even though they be sixty years of age. When George mentioned the matter to Miss Todd, that lady declared herself delighted. She had heard, she said, of the distinguished arrival at the hotel, but she had been almost afraid to ask such a man as Sir Lionel to join their foolish little party. Then Miss Baker, who in this affair bore the next authority to Miss Todd, declared that she had intended to ask him, taking upon herself the freedom of an old acquaintance; and so that matter was arranged. \n \n The party was not to be a large one. There was Miss Todd, the compounder of it, a maiden lady, fat, fair, and perhaps almost forty; a jolly jovial lady, intent on seeing the world, and indifferent to many of its prejudices and formal restraints. \"If she threw herself in Sir Lionel\u0027s way, people would of course say that she wanted to marry him; but she did not care a straw what people said; if she found Sir Lionel agreeable, she would throw herself in his way.\" So she told Miss Baker—with perhaps more courage than the occasion required. \n \n Then there was Mrs. and Miss Jones. Miss Jones was the young lady who lost her parasol on the Mount of Offence, and so recklessly charged the Arab children of Siloam with the theft. Mr. Jones was also in Jerusalem, but could not be persuaded to attend at Miss Todd\u0027s behest. He was steadily engaged in antiquarian researches, being minded to bring out to the world some startling new theory as to certain points in Bible chronology and topography. He always went about the city with a trowel and a big set of tablets; and certain among the more enthusiastic of the visitors to Jerusalem had put him down as an infidel. \n \n There were also Mr. and Mrs. Hunter—a bridegroom and bride, now on their wedding trip; a somewhat fashionable couple, who were both got up with considerable attention as to oriental costume. Mrs. Hunter seemed to think a good deal about her trousers, and Mr. Hunter\u0027s mind was equally taken up with the fact that he had ceased to wear any. They had a knowing way of putting on their turbans, and carried their sashes gracefully; those, however, who had seen Mr. Hunter roll himself into his sash, were of opinion that sooner or later he would suffer from vertigo in his head. Miss Baker and her niece had fallen in with these people, and were considered to be of the same party. \n \n There was a clergyman to be there, one Mr. Cruse, the gentleman who had been so keenly annoyed at the absence of potatoes from the dinner board. He was travelling in charge of a young gentleman of fortune, a Mr. Pott, by whose fond parents the joint expense of the excursion was defrayed. Mr. Cruse was a University man, of course; had been educated at Trinity College Cambridge, and piqued himself much on being far removed from the dangers of Puseyism. He was a man not of a happy frame of mind, and seemed to find that from Dan to Beersheba everything in truth was barren. He was good-looking, unmarried, not without some talent, and seemed to receive from the ladies there assembled more attention than his merits altogether deserved. \n \n Mr. M\u0027Gabbery had talked of not going, but had been over-persuaded by the good-natured Miss Todd. He had become almost overwhelmed by the intensity of his feelings in regard to the sacred associations of the place, since George Bertram had contrived to seat himself between Miss Baker and Miss Waddington. Up to that moment, no one had been merrier than he. He had, so he had flattered himself, altogether cut out Mr. Cruse in that special quarter, the good graces namely of those two ladies, and had been prepared to take on his own shoulders all the hard work of the picnic. But now things were altered with him; he had some doubts whether the sacredness of the valley would not be desecrated by such a proceeding, and consulted Mr. Cruse on the matter. Hitherto these gentlemen had not been close friends; but now they allied themselves as against a common enemy. Mr. Cruse did not care much for associations, seemed indeed to think that any special attention to sacred places savoured of idolatry, and professed himself willing to eat his dinner on any of the hills or in any of the valleys round Jerusalem. Fortified with so good an opinion, and relying on the excellence of his purpose, Mr. M\u0027Gabbery gave way, and renewed his offers of assistance to Miss Todd. \n \n There was also Mr. Pott, Mr. Cruse\u0027s young charge, the son of a man largely engaged in the linen trade; a youth against whom very little can be alleged. His time at present was chiefly given up to waiting on Miss Jones; and, luckier in this respect than his tutor, Mr. Cruse, he had no rival to interfere with his bliss. \n \n Miss Baker and Miss Waddington made up the party. Of the former, little more need be said, and that little should be all in her praise. She was a lady-like, soft-mannered, easy-tempered woman, devoted to her niece, but not strongly addicted to personal exertions on her own part. The fact that she was now at Jerusalem, so far away from her own comfortable drawing-room, sufficiently proved that she was devoted to her niece. \n \n And now for Caroline Waddington, our donna primissima. Her qualities, attributes, and virtues must be given more in detail than those of her companions at the picnic, seeing that she is destined to fill a prominent place upon our canvas. \n \n At the time of which we are speaking, she might perhaps be twenty years of age; but her general appearance, her figure, and especially the strong character marked in her face, would have led one to suspect that she was older. She was certainly at that time a beautiful girl—very beautiful, handsome in the outline of her face, graceful and dignified in her mien, nay, sometimes almost majestic—a Juno rather than a Venus. But any Paris who might reject her, awed by the rigour of her dignity, would know at the time that he was wrong in his judgment. She was tall, but not so tall as to be unfeminine in her height. Her head stood nobly on her shoulders, giving to her bust that ease and grace of which sculptors are so fond, and of which tight-laced stays are so utterly subversive. Her hair was very dark—not black, but the darkest shade of brown, and was worn in simple rolls on the side of her face. It was very long and very glossy, soft as the richest silk, and gifted apparently with a delightful aptitude to keep itself in order. No stray jagged ends would show themselves if by chance she removed her bonnet, nor did it even look as though it had been prematurely crushed and required to be afresh puffed out by some head-dresser\u0027s mechanism. She had the forehead of a Juno; white, broad, and straight; not shining as are some foreheads, which seem as though an insufficient allowance of skin had been vouchsafed for their covering. It was a forehead on which an angel might long to press his lips—if angels have lips, and if, as we have been told, they do occasionally descend from their starry heights to love the daughters of men. \n \n Nor would an angel with a shade of human passion in his temperament have been contented with her forehead. Her mouth had all the richness of youth, and the full enticing curves and ruby colour of Anglo-Saxon beauty. Caroline Waddington was no pale, passionless goddess; her graces and perfections were human, and in being so were the more dangerous to humanity. Her forehead we have said, or should have said, was perfect; we dare not affirm quite so much in praise of her mouth: there was sometimes a hardness there, not in the lines of the feature itself, but in the expression which it conveyed, a want of tenderness, perhaps of trust, and too much self-confidence, it may be, for a woman\u0027s character. The teeth within it, however, were never excelled by any that ever graced the face of a woman. \n \n Her nose was not quite Grecian; had it been so, her face might have been fairer, but it would certainly have been less expressive. Nor could it be called retroussé, but it had the slightest possible tendency in that direction; and the nostrils were more open, more ready to breathe forth flashes of indignation than is ever the case with a truly Grecian nose. \n \n The contour of her face was admirable: nothing could exceed in beauty the lines of her cheeks or the shape and softness of her chin. Those who were fastidious in their requirements might object to them that they bore no dimple; but after all, it is only prettiness that requires a dimple: full-blown beauty wants no such adventitious aid. \n \n But her eyes! Miss Waddington\u0027s eyes! The eyes are the poet\u0027s strongest fortress; it is for their description that he most gathers up his forces and puts forth all his strength. What of her eyes? Well, her eyes were bright enough, large enough, well set in her head. They were clever eyes too—nay, honest eyes also, which is better. But they were not softly feminine eyes. They never hid themselves beneath their soft fringes when too curiously looked into, as a young girl at her window half hides herself behind her curtain. They were bold eyes, I was going to say, but the word would signify too much in their dispraise; daring eyes, I would rather say, courageous, expressive, never shrinking, sometimes also suspicious. They were fit rather for a man than for so beautiful a girl as our Caroline Waddington. \n \n But perhaps the most wonderful grace about her was her walk. \"Vera incessu patuit Dea.\" Alas! how few women can walk! how many are wilfully averse to attempting any such motion! They scuffle, they trip, they trot, they amble, they waddle, they crawl, they drag themselves on painfully, as though the flounces and furbelows around them were a burden too heavy for easy, graceful motion; but, except in Spain, they rarely walk. In this respect our heroine was equal to an Andalusian. \n \n Such and so great were Miss Waddington\u0027s outward graces. Some attempt must also be made to tell of those inner stores with which this gallant vessel was freighted; for, after all, the outward bravery is not everything with a woman. It may be that a man in selecting his wife rarely looks for much else;—for that in addition, of course, to money; but though he has looked for little else, some other things do frequently force themselves on his attention soon after the knot is tied; and as Caroline Waddington will appear in these pages as wife as well as maid, as a man\u0027s companion as well as his plaything, it may be well to say now something as to her fitness for such occupation. \n \n We will say, then, that she was perhaps even more remarkable for her strength of mind than for her beauty of person. At present, she was a girl of twenty, and hardly knew her own power; but the time was to come when she should know it and should use it. She was possessed of a stubborn, enduring, manly will; capable of conquering much, and not to be conquered easily. She had a mind which, if rightly directed, might achieve great and good things, but of which it might be predicted that it would certainly achieve something, and that if not directed for good, it might not improbably direct itself for evil. It was impossible that she should ever grow into a piece of domestic furniture, contented to adapt itself to such uses as a marital tyrant might think fit to require of it. If destined to fall into good hands, she might become a happy, loving wife; but it was quite as possible that she should be neither happy nor loving. \n \n Like most other girls, she no doubt thought much of what might be her lot in love—thought much of loving, though she had never yet loved. It has been said that her turn of mind was manly; but it must not on that account be imagined that her wishes and aspirations were at present other than feminine. Her heart and feeling\u0027s were those of a girl, at any rate as yet; but her will and disposition were masculine in their firmness. \n \n For one so young, she had great and dangerous faults of character—great, as being injurious to her happiness; and dangerous, as being likely to grow with her years. Her faults were not young faults. Though true herself, she was suspicious of others; though trustworthy, she was not trustful: and what person who is not trustful ever remains trustworthy? Who can be fit for confidence who cannot himself confide? She was imperious, too, when occasion offered itself to her proud spirit. With her aunt, whom she loved, she was not so. Her she was content to persuade, using a soft voice and a soft eye; but with those whom she could not persuade and wished to rule, her voice was sometimes stern enough, and her eye far from soft. \n \n She was a clever girl, capable of talking well, and possessed of more information than most young ladies of the same age. She had been at an excellent school, if any schools are really excellent for young ladies; but there was, nevertheless, something in her style of thought hardly suitable to the softness of girlhood. She could speak of sacred things with a mocking spirit, the mockery of philosophy rather than of youth; she had little or no enthusiasm, though there was passion enough deep seated in her bosom; she suffered from no transcendentalism; she saw nothing through a halo of poetic inspiration: among the various tints of her atmosphere there was no rose colour; she preferred wit to poetry; and her smile was cynical rather than joyous. \n \n Now I have described my donna primissima, with hardly sufficient detail for my own satisfaction, doubtless with far too much for yours, oh, my reader! It must be added, however, that she was an orphan; that she lived entirely with her aunt, Miss Baker; that her father had been in early life a sort of partner with Mr. George Bertram; that Mr. George Bertram was her guardian, though he had hitherto taken but little trouble in looking after her, whatever trouble he may have taken in looking after her money; and that she was possessed of a moderate fortune, say about four thousand pounds. \n \n A picnic undertaken from Jerusalem must in some respects be unlike any picnic elsewhere. Ladies cannot be carried to it in carriages, because at Jerusalem there are no carriages; nor can the provisions be conveyed even in carts, for at Jerusalem there are no carts. The stock of comestibles was therefore packed in hampers on a camel\u0027s back, and sent off to the valley by one route, whereas Miss Todd and her friends went on horseback and on donkey-back by another and a longer road. \n \n It may as well be mentioned that Miss Todd was a little ashamed of the magnitude to which her undertaking had attained. Her original plan had merely been this:—that she and a few others should ride through the valleys round the city, and send a basket of sandwiches to meet them at some hungry point on the road. Now there was a cortège of eleven persons, exclusive of the groom-boys, a boiled ham, sundry chickens, hard-boiled eggs, and champagne. Miss Todd was somewhat ashamed of this. Here, in England, one would hardly inaugurate a picnic to Kensal Green, or the Highgate Cemetery, nor select the tombs of our departed great ones as a shelter under which to draw one\u0027s corks. But Miss Todd boasted of high spirits: when this little difficulty had been first suggested to her by Mr. M\u0027Gabbery, she had scoffed at it, and had enlarged her circle in a spirit of mild bravado. Then chance had done more for her; and now she was doomed to preside over a large party of revellers immediately over the ashes of James the Just. \n \n None but Englishmen or Englishwomen do such things as this. To other people is wanting sufficient pluck for such enterprises; is wanting also a certain mixture of fun, honest independence, and bad taste. Let us go into some church on the Continent—in Italy, we will say—where the walls of the churches still boast of the great works of the great masters.—Look at that man standing on the very altar-step while the priest is saying his mass; look at his gray shooting-coat, his thick shoes, his wide-awake hat stuck under one arm, and his stick under the other, while he holds his opera-glass to his eyes. How he shuffles about to get the best point of sight, quite indifferent as to clergy or laity! All that bell-ringing, incense-flinging, and breast-striking is nothing to him: he has paid dearly to be brought thither; he has paid the guide who is kneeling a little behind him; he is going to pay the sacristan who attends him; he is quite ready to pay the priest himself, if the priest would only signify his wish that way; but he has come there to see that fresco, and see it he will: respecting that he will soon know more than either the priest or his worshippers. Perhaps some servant of the church, coming to him with submissive, almost suppliant gesture, begs him to step back just for one moment. The lover of art glares at him with insulted look, and hardly deigns to notice him further: he merely turns his eye to his Murray, puts his hat down on the altar-step, and goes on studying his subject. All the world—German, Frenchman, Italian, Spaniard—all men of all nations know that that ugly gray shooting-coat must contain an Englishman. He cares for no one. If any one upsets him, he can do much towards righting himself; and if more be wanted, has he not Lord Malmesbury or Lord Clarendon at his back? But what would this Englishman say if his place of worship were disturbed by some wandering Italian? \n \n It was somewhat in this way with Miss Todd. She knew that what she was about to do was rather absurd, but she had the blood of the Todds warm at her heart. The Todds were a people not easily frightened, and Miss Todd was not going to disgrace her lineage. True, she had not intended to feed twelve people over a Jewish sepulchre, but as the twelve people had assembled, looking to her for food, she was not the woman to send them away fasting: so she gallantly led the way through the gate of Jaffa, Sir Lionel attending her on a donkey. \n \n When once out of the town, they turned sharp to the left. Their path lay through the valley of Gihon, through the valley of Hinnom, down among those strange, open sepulchres, deeply excavated in caves on the mountain-sides—sepulchres quite unlike those below in the valley of Jehoshaphat. There they are all covered, each stone marking a grave; but here they lie in open catacombs—in caves, at least, of which the entrance is open. The hardy stranger crawling in may lay his hand within the cell—nay, may crawl up into it if he will—in which have mouldered the bones of some former visitor to Jerusalem. For this, so saith tradition, is the field purchased with the reward of iniquity. It was the burying-place for strangers, Aceldama, the field of blood. \n \n But where be these bones now? for the catacombs are mostly empty. Mr. Pott, descending as far as he could into the deepest of them, did at last bring forth a skull and two parts of a back-bone; did present the former with much grace to Miss Jones, who, on beholding it, very nearly fell from off her donkey. \n \n \"For shame, Pott,\" said Mr. Cruse. \"How could you handle anything so disgusting? You are desecrating the grave of some unfortunate Mussulman who has probably died within the last fifty years.\" Mr. Cruse was always intent on showing that he believed none of the traditions of the country. \n \n \"It was quite dreadful of you, Mr. Pott,\" said Miss Jones; \"quite dreadful! Indeed, I don\u0027t know what you would not do. But I am quite sure he was never a Mahomedan.\" \n \n \"He looked like a Jew, didn\u0027t he?\" said Pott. \n \n \"Oh! I did not see the face; but he was certainly either a Jew or a Christian. Only think. Perhaps those remains have been there for nearly eighteen hundred years. Is it not wonderful? Mamma, it was just here that I lost my parasol.\" \n \n Sir Lionel had headed the cavalcade with Miss Todd, but George Bertram was true to his new friends, Miss Baker and Miss Waddington. So also, for a time, were Mr. M\u0027Gabbery and Mr. Cruse. As the aunt and niece rode beside each other, a great part of this gallant attention fell upon the former. Indeed, the easiest way of addressing the beauty was often found to be through the beauty\u0027s aunt; and it may be doubted whether Mr. M\u0027Gabbery would not have retreated long since in despair, but for the scintillations of civility which fell to him from Miss Baker\u0027s good-humour. He had had the good fortune of some previous days\u0027 journeying with them on horseback through the desert, and had found that privilege gave him an inestimable advantage over Mr. Cruse. Why should it not also suffice as regarded this new comer? He had held much commune with himself on the subject that morning; had called himself to task for his own pusillanimity, and had then fortified his courage with the old reflection about fair ladies and faint hearts—and also with a glass of brandy. He was therefore disposed to make himself very unpleasant to poor George if occasion should require. \n \n \"How delighted you must have been to see your father!\" said Miss Baker, who, though her temper would not permit her to be uncivil to Mr. M\u0027Gabbery, would readily have dispensed with that gentleman\u0027s attendance. \n \n \"Indeed, I was. I never saw him before, you know.\" \n \n \"Never saw him, your father, before, Mr. Bertram?\" said Caroline. \"Why, aunt Mary says that I have seen him.\" \n \n \"I never saw him to remember him. One doesn\u0027t count one\u0027s acquaintance before seven or eight years of age.\" \n \n \"Your memory must be very bad, then,\" said Mr. M\u0027Gabbery, \"or your childhood\u0027s love for your father very slight. I perfectly remember the sweetness of my mother\u0027s caresses when I was but three years old. There is nothing, Miss Waddington, to equal the sweetness of a mother\u0027s kisses.\" \n \n \"I never knew them,\" said she. \"But I have found an aunt\u0027s do nearly as well.\" \n \n \"A grandmother\u0027s are not bad,\" said Bertram, looking very grave. \n \n \"I can never think of my mother without emotion,\" continued Mr. M\u0027Gabbery. \"I remember, as though it were yesterday, when I first stood at her knee, with a picture-book on her lap before me. It is the furthest point to which memory carries me—and the sweetest.\" \n \n \"I can remember back much before that,\" said George; \"a great deal before that. Listen to this, Miss Baker. My earliest impression was a hatred of dishonesty.\" \n \n \"I hope your views have not altered since,\" said Caroline. \n \n \"Very materially, I fear. But I must tell you about my memory. I was lying once in my cradle—\" \n \n \"You don\u0027t mean to tell me you remember that?\" said M\u0027Gabbery. \n \n \"Perfectly, as you do the picture-book. Well, there I was lying, Miss Baker, with my little eyes wide open. It is astonishing how much babies see, though people never calculate on their having eyes at all. I was lying on my back, staring at the mantelpiece, on which my mother had left her key-basket.\" \n \n \"You remember, of course, that it was her key-basket?\" said Miss Waddington, with a smile that made M\u0027Gabbery clench his walking-stick in his hand. \n \n \"Perfectly; because she always kept her halfpence there also. Well, there was a nursery-girl who used to be about me in those days. I distinctly saw her go to that basket, Miss Baker, and take out a penny; and I then made up my mind that the first use I would make of my coming speech should be to tell my mother. That, I think, is the furthest point to which my memory carries me.\" \n \n The ladies laughed heartily, but Mr. M\u0027Gabbery frowned bitterly. \"You must have dreamt it,\" said he. \n \n \"It is just possible,\" said George; \"but I don\u0027t think it. Come, Miss Waddington, let us have your earliest recollections.\" \n \n \"Ah! mine will not be interesting. They do not go back at all so far. I think they have reference to bread and butter.\" \n \n \"I remember being very angry,\" said Miss Baker, \"because papa prophesied that I should be an old maid. It was very hard on me, for his prophecy no doubt brought about the fact.\" \n \n \"But the fact is no fact as yet,\" said Mr. M\u0027Gabbery, with a smirking gallantry for which he ought to have been kicked. \n \n \"I beg your pardon, Mr. M\u0027Gabbery,\" said Miss Waddington. \"It is quite an established fact. My aunt will never have my consent to marry; and I am sure she will never dream of such a thing without it.\" \n \n \"And so Mr. M\u0027Gabbery\u0027s hopes in that direction are all at an end,\" said George, who was now able to speak to Caroline without being heard by the others. \n \n \"I declare I think he has entertained some such idea, for he never leaves my aunt alone for a minute. He has been very civil, very; but, Mr. Bertram, perhaps you know that a very civil man may be a bore.\" \n \n \"He always is, I think. No man is really liked who is ever ready to run on messages and tie up parcels. It is generally considered that a man knows his own value, and that, if he be willing to do such work, such work is fit for him.\" \n \n \"You never do anything to oblige, then?\" \n \n \"Very rarely; at least, not in the little domestic line. If one could have an opportunity of picking a lady out of a fire, or saving her from the clutches of an Italian bravo, or getting her a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, one would be inclined to do it. In such cases, there would be no contempt mixed up with the lady\u0027s gratitude. But ladies are never really grateful to a man for turning himself into a flunky.\" \n \n \"Ah! I like to be attended to all the same.\" \n \n \"Then there is Mr. M\u0027Gabbery. Half a smile will keep him at your feet the whole day.\" \n \n Mr. M\u0027Gabbery and poor Miss Baker were now walking behind them, side by side. But his felicity in this respect was not at all sufficient for that gentleman. In their long journey from Egypt, he and Miss Waddington had always been within speaking distance; and who was the stranger of to-day that was thus to come and separate them? \n \n \"Miss Waddington,\" he cried, \"do you remember when your horse stumbled in the sand at El Arish? Ah! what a pleasant day that was!\" \n \n \"But you have not recalled it by a very pleasant incident. I was very nearly being thrown out of my saddle.\" \n \n \"And how we had to wait for our dinner at Gaza till the camels came up?\" And Mr. M\u0027Gabbery, urging on his horse, brought him up once more abreast with that of Miss Waddington. \n \n \"I shall soon have as great a horror of Gaza as Samson had,\" said she, sotto voce. \"I almost feel myself already in bonds under Philistian yoke whenever it is mentioned.\" \n \n \"Talking of recollections, that journey will certainly be among the sunniest of my life\u0027s memories,\" said Mr. M\u0027Gabbery. \n \n \"It was sunny, certainly,\" said Miss Waddington; for the heat of the desert had been oppressive. \n \n \"Ah! and so sweet! That encamping in your own tent; preparing your own meals; having everything, as it were, within yourself. Civilized life has nothing to offer equal to that. A person who has only gone from city to city, or from steamboat to steamboat, knows nothing of oriental life. Does he, Miss Waddington?\" This was intended as a blow at Bertram, who had got to Jerusalem without sleeping under canvas. \n \n \"What ignorant wretches the natives must be!\" said George; \"for they apparently sleep as regularly in their own beds as any stupid Christian in England.\" \n \n \"I am not sure that even Mr. M\u0027Gabbery would admire the tents so much if he had not some Christian comforts along with him.\" \n \n \"His brandy-flask and dressing-case, for instance,\" said George. \n \n \"Yes; and his mattress and blankets,\" said Caroline. \n \n \"His potted meat and preserved soup.\" \n \n \"And especially his pot to boil his potatoes in.\" \n \n \"That was Mr. Cruse,\" said Mr. M\u0027Gabbery, quite angrily. \"For myself, I do not care a bit about potatoes.\" \n \n \"So it was, Mr. M\u0027Gabbery; and I beg your pardon. It is Mr. Cruse whose soul is among the potatoes. But, if I remember right, it was you who were so angry when the milk ran out.\" Then Mr. M\u0027Gabbery again receded, and talked to Mrs. Jones about his associations. \n \n \"How thoroughly the Turks and Arabs beat us in point of costume,\" said Mrs. Hunter to Mr. Cruse. \n \n \"It will be very hard, at any rate, for any of them to beat you,\" said the tutor. \"Since I have been out here, I have seen no one adopt their ways with half as much grace as you do.\" \n \n Mrs. Hunter looked down well pleased to her ancles, which were covered, and needed to be covered, by no riding-habit. \"I was not thinking so much of myself as of Mr. Hunter. Women, you know, Mr. Cruse, are nothing in this land.\" \n \n \"Except when imported from Christendom, Mrs. Hunter.\" \n \n \"But I was speaking of gentlemen\u0027s toilets. Don\u0027t you think the Turkish dress very becoming? I declare, I shall never bear to see Charles again in a coat and waistcoat and trousers.\" \n \n \"Nor he you in an ordinary silk gown, puffed out with crinoline.\" \n \n \"Well, I suppose we must live in the East altogether then. I am sure I should not object. I know one thing—I shall never endure to put a bonnet on my head again. By-the-by, Mr. Cruse, who is this Sir Lionel Bertram that has just come? Is he a baronet?\" \n \n \"Oh dear, no; nothing of that sort, I imagine. I don\u0027t quite know who he is; but that young man is his son.\" \n \n \"They say he\u0027s very clever, don\u0027t they?\" \n \n \"He has that sort of boy\u0027s cleverness, I dare say, which goes towards taking a good degree.\" Mr. Cruse himself had not shone very brightly at the University. \n \n \"Miss Waddington seems very much smitten with him; don\u0027t you think so?\" \n \n \"Miss Waddington is a beautiful girl; and variable—as beautiful girls sometimes are.\" \n \n \"Mr. Cruse, don\u0027t be satirical.\" \n \n \"\u0027Praise undeserved is satire in disguise,\u0027\" said Mr. Cruse, not quite understanding, himself, why he made the quotation. But it did exceedingly well. Mrs. Hunter smiled sweetly on him, said that he was a dangerous man, and that no one would take him to be a clergyman; upon which Mr. Cruse begged that she would spare his character. \n \n And now they had come to the fountain of Enrogel, and having dismounted from their steeds, stood clustering about the low wall which surrounds the little pool of water. \n \n \"This, Sir Lionel,\" said Miss Todd, acting cicerone, \"is the fountain of Enrogel, which you know so well by name.\" \n \n \"Ah!\" said Sir Lionel. \"It seems rather dirty at present; doesn\u0027t it?\" \n \n \"That is because the water is so low. When there has been much rain, there is quite a flood here. Those little gardens and fields there are the most fertile spot round Jerusalem, because there is so much irrigation here.\" \n \n \"That\u0027s where the Jerusalem artichokes are grown, I suppose.\" \n \n \"It is a singular fact, that though there are plenty of artichokes, that special plant is unknown,\" said Mr. M\u0027Gabbery. \"Do you remember, Miss Waddington—\" \n \n But Miss Waddington had craftily slipped round the corner of the wall, and was now admiring Mrs. Hunter\u0027s costume, on the other side of the fountain. \n \n \"And that is the village of Siloam,\" continued Miss Todd, pointing to a range of cabins, some of which seemed to be cut out of the rock on the hill-side, on her right hand as she looked up towards the valley of Jehoshaphat. \"And that is the pool of Siloam, Sir Lionel; we shall go up there.\" \n \n \"Ah!\" said Sir Lionel again. \n \n \"Is it not interesting?\" said Miss Todd; and a smiling gleam of satisfaction spread itself across her jovial ruddy face. \n \n \"Very,\" said Sir Lionel. \"But don\u0027t you find it rather hot?\" \n \n \"Yes, it is warm. But one gets accustomed to that. I do so like to find myself among these names which used to torment me so when I was a child. I had all manner of mysterious ideas about the pool of Bethesda and the beautiful gate, about the hill of Sion, and Gehenna, and the brook Cedron. I had a sort of belief that these places were scattered wide over the unknown deserts of Asia; and now, Sir Lionel, I am going to show them all to you in one day.\" \n \n \"Would they were scattered wider, that the pleasure might last the longer,\" said Sir Lionel, taking off his hat as he bowed to Miss Todd, but putting it on again very quickly, as he felt the heat. \n \n \"Yes; but the mystery, the beautiful mystery, is all gone,\" said Miss Jones. \"I shall never feel again about these places as I used to do.\" \n \n \"Nor I either, I hope,\" said Mr. Pott. \"I always used to catch it for scripture geography.\" \n \n \"Yes, the mystery of your childhood will be gone, Miss Jones,\" said Mr. M\u0027Gabbery, who, in his present state of hopelessness as regarded Miss Waddington, was ill-naturedly interfering with young Pott. \"The mystery of your childhood will be gone; but another mystery, a more matured mystery, will be created in your imagination. Your associations will henceforth bear a richer tint.\" \n \n \"I don\u0027t know that,\" said Miss Jones, who did not approve of being interfered with a bit better than did Mr. Pott. \n \n And then they remounted, and the cavalcade moved on. They turned up the rising ground towards the city wall, and leaving on the left the gardens in which Jerusalem artichokes did not grow, they came to the pool of Siloam. Here most of them again descended, and climbed down to the water, which bursts out from its underground channel into a cool, but damp and somewhat dirty ravine. \n \n \"You are my guide, Miss Todd, in everything,\" said Sir Lionel. \"Is it necessary that I should study scripture geography down in that hole? If you bid me, I\u0027ll do it.\" \n \n \"Well, Sir Lionel, I\u0027ll let you off; the more especially as I have been down there myself already, and got dreadfully draggled in doing so. Oh! I declare, there is Miss Waddington in the water.\" \n \n Miss Waddington was in the water. Not in such a manner, gentlest of readers, as to occasion the slightest shock to your susceptible nerves; but in such a degree as to be very disagreeable to her boots, and the cause of infinite damage to her stockings. George Bertram had handed her down, and when in the act of turning round to give similar assistance to some other adventurous lady, had left her alone on the slippery stones. Of course any young lady would take advantage of such an unguarded moment to get into some catastrophe. \n \n Alas! and again alas! Unfortunately, Mr. M\u0027Gabbery had been the first to descend to the pool. He had calculated, cunningly enough, that in being there, seeing that the space was not very large, the duty must fall to his lot of receiving into his arms any such ladies as chose to come down—Miss Waddington, who was known to be very adventurous, among the number. He was no sooner there, however, than George Bertram jumped in almost upon him, and hitherto he had not had an opportunity of touching Miss Waddington\u0027s glove. But now it seemed that fortune was to reward him. \n \n \"Good heavens!\" cried Mr. M\u0027Gabbery, as he dashed boldly into the flood, thereby splashing the water well up into Caroline\u0027s face. There was not much occasion for this display, for the gentleman could have assisted the lady quite as effectually without even wetting his toes; but common misfortunes do create common sympathies—or at least they should do. Would it not be natural that Miss Waddington and Mr. M\u0027Gabbery, when both wet through up to their knees, should hang together in their sufferings, make common cause of it, talk each of what the other felt and understood so well? Nay, might it not be probable that, in obedience to the behests of some wise senior, they might be sent back to the city together;—understand, O reader, that the wall of Jerusalem had never yet been distant from them half a mile—back, we say, together to get dry stockings? To achieve such an object, Mr. M\u0027Gabbery would have plunged bodily beneath the wave—had the wave been deep enough to receive his body. As it was, it only just came over the tops of his boots, filling them comfortably with water. \n \n \"Oh, Mr. M\u0027Gabbery!\" exclaimed the ungrateful lady. \"Now you have drowned me altogether.\" \n \n \"I never saw anything so awkward in my life,\" said M\u0027Gabbery, looking up at Bertram with a glance that should have frozen his blood. \n \n \"Nor I, either,\" said Caroline. \n \n \"What had you better do? Pray give me your hand, Miss Waddington. To leave you in such a manner as that! We managed better in the desert, did we not, Miss Waddington? You really must go back to Jerusalem for dry shoes and stockings; you really must. Where is Miss Baker? Give me your hand, Miss Waddington; both hands, you had better.\" \n \n So much said Mr. M\u0027Gabbery while struggling in the pool of Siloam. But in the meantime, Miss Waddington, turning quickly round, had put out her hand to Bertram, who was standing—and I regret to say all but laughing—on the rock above her; and before Mr. M\u0027Gabbery\u0027s eloquence was over, she was safely landed among her friends. \n \n \"Oh, Mr. Bertram,\" said she; \"you are a horrid man. I\u0027ll never forgive you. Had I trusted myself to poor Mr. M\u0027Gabbery, I should have been dry-footed at this moment.\" And she shook the water from off her dress, making a damp circle around herself as a Newfoundland dog sometimes does. \"If I served you right, I should make you go to the hotel for a pair of shoes.\" \n \n \"Do, Miss Waddington; make him go,\" said Sir Lionel. \"If he doesn\u0027t, I\u0027ll go myself.\" \n \n \"I shall be delighted,\" said Mr. Cruse; \"my donkey is very quick;\" and the clergyman mounted ready to start. \"Only I shouldn\u0027t know where to find the things.\" \n \n \"No, Mr. Cruse; and I couldn\u0027t tell you. Besides, there is nothing I like so much as wet feet,—except wet strings to my hat, for which latter I have to thank Mr. M\u0027Gabbery.\" \n \n \"I will go, of course,\" said M\u0027Gabbery, emerging slowly from the pool. \"Of course it is for me to go; I shall be glad of an opportunity of getting dry boots myself.\" \n \n \"I am so sorry you have got wet,\" said the beauty. \n \n \"Oh! it\u0027s nothing; I like it. I was not going to see you in the water without coming to you. Pray tell me what I shall fetch. I know all your boxes so well, you know, so I can have no difficulty. Will they be in the one with C. W. on it in brass nails? That was the one which fell off the camel near the Temple of Dagon.\" Poor Mr. M\u0027Gabbery! that ride through the desert was an oasis in his otherwise somewhat barren life, never to be forgotten. \n \n \"I am the sinner, Miss Waddington,\" said George, at last, \"and on me let the punishment fall. I will go back to Jerusalem; and in order that you may suffer no inconvenience, I will bring hither all your boxes and all your trunks on the backs of a score of Arab porters.\" \n \n \"You know you intend to do no such thing,\" said she. \"You have already told me your ideas as to waiting upon young ladies.\" \n \n There was, however, at last some whispering between Miss Baker and her niece, in which Mr. M\u0027Gabbery vainly attempted to join, and the matter ended in one of the grooms being sent into the town, laden with a bunch of keys and a written message for Miss Baker\u0027s servant. Before dinner-time, Miss Waddington had comfortably changed her stockings in the upper story of the tomb of St. James, and Mr. M\u0027Gabbery—but Mr. M\u0027Gabbery\u0027s wet feet did not receive the attention which they deserved. \n \n Passing on from the pool of Siloam, they came to a water-course at which there was being conducted a considerable washing of clothes. The washerwomen—the term is used as being generic to the trade and not to the sex, for some of the performers were men—were divided into two classes, who worked separately; not so separately but what they talked together, and were on friendly terms; but still there was a division. The upper washerwomen, among whom the men were at work, were Mahomedans; the lower set were Jewesses. As to the men, but little observation was made, except that they seemed expert enough, dabbing their clothes, rubbing in the soap, and then rinsing, very much in the manner of Christians. But it was impossible not to look at the women. The female followers of the Prophet had, as they always have, some pretence of a veil for their face. In the present instance, they held in their teeth a dirty blue calico rag, which passed over their heads, acting also as a shawl. By this contrivance, intended only to last while the Christians were there, they concealed one side of the face and the chin. No one could behold them without wishing that the eclipse had been total. No epithet commonly applied to women in this country could adequately describe their want of comeliness. They kept their faces to their work, and except that they held their rags between their teeth, they gave no sign of knowing that strangers were standing by them. \n \n It was different with the Jewesses. When they were stared at, they stood up boldly and stared again;—and well worth looking at they were. There were three or four of them, young women all, though already mothers, for their children were playing on the grass behind them. Each bore on her head that moon-shaped head-dress which is there the symbol of a Jewess; and no more graceful tiara can a woman wear. It was wonderful that the same land should produce women so different as were these close neighbours. The Mahomedans were ape-like; but the Jewesses were glorious specimens of feminine creation. They were somewhat too bold, perhaps; there was too much daring in their eyes, as, with their naked shoulders and bosoms nearly bare, they met the eyes of the men that were looking at them. But there was nothing immodest in their audacity; it was defiant rather, and scornful. \n \n There was one among them, a girl, perhaps of eighteen, who might have been a sculptor\u0027s model, not only for form and figure, but for the expression of her countenance and the beautiful turn of her head and shoulders. She was very unlike the Jewess that is ordinarily pictured to us. She had no beaky nose, no thin face, no sharp, small, black, bright eyes; she was fair, as Esther was fair; her forehead and face were broad, her eyes large and open; yet she was a Jewess, plainly a Jewess; such a Jewess as are many still to be seen—in Palestine, at least, if not elsewhere. \n \n When they came upon her, she was pressing the dripping water from some large piece of linen, a sheet probably. In doing this she had cunningly placed one end firmly under her foot upon a stone, and then, with her hands raised high above her head, she twisted and retwisted it till the water oozing out fell in heavy drops round her feet. Her arms and neck were bare, as were also her feet; and it was clear that she put forth to her work as much strength as usually falls to the lot of a woman in any country. \n \n She was very fair to look at, but there was about her no feminine softness. Do not laugh, reader, unless you have already stopped to think, and, thinking, have decided that a girl of eighteen, being a washerwoman, must therefore be without feminine softness. I would not myself say that it is so. But here at least there was no feminine softness, no tenderness in the eye, no young shame at being gazed at. She paused for a moment in her work, and gave back to them all the look they gave her; and then, as though they were beneath her notice, she strained once more at her task, and so dropped the linen to the ground. \n \n \"If I knew how to set about the bargain, I would take that woman home with me, and mould her to be my wife.\" Such was George Bertram\u0027s outspoken enthusiasm. \n \n \"Moulded wives never answer well,\" said Sir Lionel. \n \n \"I think he would prefer one that had been dipped,\" whispered Miss Todd to the colonel; but her allusion to Miss Waddington\u0027s little accident on the water, and to the chandler\u0027s wares, was not thoroughly appreciated. \n \n It has been said that the hampers were to be sent to the tomb of Zachariah; but they agreed to dine immediately opposite to that of St. James the Less. This is situated in the middle of the valley of Jehoshaphat, in the centre of myriads of Jewish tombs, directly opposite to the wall built with those huge temple stones, not many feet over the then dry water-course of the brook Cedron. Such was the spot chosen by Miss Todd for her cold chickens and champagne. \n \n Of course they wandered about a little in pairs and trios while these dainties were being prepared for them. This St. James\u0027s tomb is a little temple built on the side of the rock, singularly graceful. The front towards the city is adorned with two or three Roman pillars, bearing, if I remember rightly, plain capitals. There is, I think, no pediment above them, or any other adjunct of architectural pretension; but the pillars themselves, so unlike anything else there, so unlike any other sepulchral monument that I, at least, have seen, make the tomb very remarkable. That it was built for a tomb is, I suppose, not to be doubted; though for whose ashes it was in fact erected may perhaps be questioned. I am not aware that any claimant has been named as a rival to St. James. \n \n The most conspicuous of these monuments is that which tradition allots to Absalom, close to this other which we have just described. It consists of a solid square erection, bearing what, for want of a better name, I must call a spire, with curved sides, the sides curving inwards as they fall from the apex to the base. This spiral roof, too low and dumpy to be properly called a spire, is very strong, built with stones laid in circles flat on each other, the circles becoming smaller as they rise towards the top. Why Absalom should have had such a tomb, who can say? That his bones were buried there, the Jews at least believe; for Jewish fathers, as they walk by with their children, bid their boys each cast a stone there to mark their displeasure at the child who rebelled against his parent. It is now nearly full of such stones. \n \n While Miss Waddington was arranging her toilet within the tomb of St. James, her admirers below were not making themselves agreeable to each other. \"It was the awkwardest thing I ever saw,\" said Mr. Cruse to Mr. M\u0027Gabbery, in a low tone, but not so low but what Bertram was intended to hear it. \n \n \"Very,\" said Mr. M\u0027Gabbery. \"Some men are awkward by nature;—seem, indeed, as though they were never intended for ladies\u0027 society.\" \n \n \"And then to do nothing but laugh at the mischief he had caused. That may be the way at Oxford; but we used to flatter ourselves at Cambridge that we had more politeness.\" \n \n \"Cambridge!\" said Bertram, turning round and speaking with the most courteous tone he could command. \"Were you at Cambridge? I thought I had understood that you were educated at St. Bees.\" Mr. Cruse had been at St. Bees, but had afterwards gone to the University. \n \n \"I was a scholar at St. John\u0027s, sir,\" replied Mr. Cruse, with much dignity. \"M\u0027Gabbery, shall we take a stroll across the valley till the ladies are ready?\" And so, having sufficiently shown their contempt for the awkward Oxonian, they moved away. \n \n \"Two very nice fellows, are they not?\" said Bertram to Mr. Hunter. \"It\u0027s a stroke of good fortune to fall in with such men as that at such a place as this.\" \n \n \"They\u0027re very well in their own way,\" said Mr. Hunter, who was lying on the grass, and flattering himself that he looked more Turkish than any Turk he had yet seen. \"But they don\u0027t seem to me to be quite at home here in the East. Few Englishman in fact are. Cruse is always wanting boiled vegetables, and M\u0027Gabbery can\u0027t eat without a regular knife and fork. Give me a pilau and a bit of bread, and I can make a capital dinner without anything to help me but my own fingers.\" \n \n \"Cruse isn\u0027t a bad kind of coach,\" said young Pott. \"He never interferes with a fellow. His only fault is that he\u0027s so spoony about women.\" \n \n \"They\u0027re gentlemanlike men,\" said Sir Lionel; \"very. One can\u0027t expect, you know, that every one should set the Thames on fire.\" \n \n \"Cruse won\u0027t do that, at any rate,\" put in Mr. Pott. \n \n \"But Mr. M\u0027Gabbery perhaps may,\" suggested George. \"At any rate, he made a little blaze just now at the brook above.\" And then the ladies came down, and the business of the day commenced; seeing which, the two injured ones returned to their posts. \n \n \"I am very fond of a picnic,\" said Sir Lionel, as, seated on a corner of a tombstone, he stretched out his glass towards Miss Todd, who had insisted on being his cupbearer for the occasion; \"excessively fond. I mean the eating and drinking part, of course. There is only one thing I like better; and that is having my dinner under a roof, upon a table, and with a chair to sit on.\" \n \n \"Oh, you ungrateful man; after all that I am doing for you!\" \n \n \"I spoke of picnics generally, Miss Todd. Could I always have my nectar filled to me by a goddess, I would be content with no room, but expect to recline on a cloud, and have thunderbolts ready at my right hand.\" \n \n \"What a beautiful Jupiter your father would make, Mr. Bertram!\" \n \n \"Yes; and what a happy king of gods with such a Juno as you, Miss Todd!\" \n \n \"Ha! ha! ha! oh dear, no. I pretend to no r?le higher than that of Hebe. Mr. M\u0027Gabbery, may I thank you for a slice of ham? I declare, these tombs are very nice tables, are they not? Only, I suppose it\u0027s very improper. Mr. Cruse, I\u0027m so sorry that we have no potatoes; but there is salad, I know.\" \n \n \"Talking of chairs,\" said Mr. Hunter, \"after all there has been no seat yet invented by man equal to a divan, either for ease, dignity, or grace.\" Mr. Hunter had long been practising to sit cross-legged, and was now attempting it on on the grass for the first time in public. It had at any rate this inconvenient effect, that he was perfectly useless; for, when once seated, he could neither help himself nor any one else. \n \n \"The cigar divan is a very nice lounge when one has nothing better to do,\" suggested Mr. Pott. \"They have capital coffee there.\" \n \n \"A divan and a sofa are much the same, I suppose,\" said George. \n \n But to this Mr. Hunter demurred, and explained at some length what were the true essential qualities of a real Turkish divan: long before he had finished, however, George had got up to get a clean plate for Miss Waddington, and in sitting down had turned his back upon the Turk. The unfortunate Turk could not revenge himself, as in his present position any motion was very difficult to him. \n \n Picnic dinners are much the same in all parts of the world, and chickens and salad are devoured at Jerusalem very much in the same way as they are at other places—except, indeed, by a few such proficients in Turkish manners as Mr. Hunter. The little Arab children stood around them, expectant of scraps, as I have seen children do also in England; and the conversation, which was dull enough at the commencement of the feast, became more animated when a few corks had flown. As the afternoon wore on, Mr. M\u0027Gabbery became almost bellicose under the continual indifference of his lady-love; and had it not been for the better sense of our hero—such better sense may be expected from gentlemen who are successful—something very like a quarrel would have taken place absolutely in the presence of Miss Todd. \n \n Perhaps Miss Waddington was not free from all blame in the matter. It would be unjust to accuse her of flirting—of flirting, at least, in the objectionable sense of the word. It was not in her nature to flirt. But it was in her nature to please herself without thinking much of the manner in which she did it, and it was in her nature also to be indifferent as to what others thought of her. Though she had never before known George Bertram, there was between them that sort of family knowledge of each other which justified a greater intimacy than between actual strangers. Then, too, he pleased her, while Mr. M\u0027Gabbery only bored. She had not yet thought enough about the world\u0027s inhabitants to have recognized and adjudicated on the difference between those who talk pleasantly and those who do not; but she felt that she was amused by this young double-first Oxonian, and she had no idea of giving up amusement when it came in her way. Of such amusement, she had hitherto known but little. Miss Baker herself was, perhaps, rather dull. Miss Baker\u0027s friends at Littlebath were not very bright; but Caroline had never in her heart accused them of being other than amusing. It is only by knowing his contrast that we recognize a bore when we meet him. It was in this manner that she now began to ascertain that Mr. M\u0027Gabbery certainly had bored her. Ascertaining it, she threw him off at once—perhaps without sufficient compunction. \n \n \"I\u0027ll cut that cock\u0027s comb before I have done with him,\" said M\u0027Gabbery to his friend Mr. Cruse, as they rode up towards St. Stephen\u0027s gate together, the rest of the cavalcade following them. Sir Lionel had suggested to Miss Todd that they might as well return, somewhat early though it was, seeing that there was cause why that feast of reason and that flow of soul should no longer be continued by them round the yet only half-emptied hampers. So the ladies had climbed up into the tomb and there adjusted their hats, and the gentlemen had seen to the steeds; and the forks had been packed up; and when Mr. M\u0027Gabbery made the state of his mind known to Mr. Cruse, they were on their way back to Jerusalem, close to the garden of Gethsemane. \n \n \"I\u0027ll cut that young cock\u0027s comb yet before I have done with him,\" repeated Mr. M\u0027Gabbery. \n \n Now Mr. Cruse, as being a clergyman, was of course not a fighting man. \"I shouldn\u0027t take any notice of him,\" said he; \"nor, indeed, of her either; I do not think she is worth it.\" \n \n \"Oh, it isn\u0027t about that,\" said M\u0027Gabbery. \"They were two women together, and I therefore was inclined to show them some attention. You know how those things go on. From one thing to another it has come to this, that they have depended on me for everything for the last three or four weeks.\" \n \n \"You haven\u0027t paid any money for them, have you?\" \n \n \"Well, no; I can\u0027t exactly say that I have paid money for them. That is to say, they have paid their own bills, and I have not lent them anything. But I dare say you know that a man never travels with ladies in that free and easy way without feeling it in his pocket. One is apt to do twenty things for them which one wouldn\u0027t do for oneself; nor they for themselves if they had to pay the piper.\" \n \n Now here a very useful moral may be deduced. Ladies, take care how you permit yourselves to fall into intimacies with unknown gentlemen on your travels. It is not pleasant to be spoken of as this man was speaking of Miss Baker and her niece. The truth was, that a more punctilious person in her money dealings than Miss Baker never carried a purse. She had not allowed Mr. M\u0027Gabbery so much as to lay out on her behalf a single piastre for oranges on the road. Nor had he been their sole companion on their journey through the desert. They had come to Jerusalem with a gentleman and his wife: Mr. M\u0027Gabbery had been kindly allowed to join them. \n \n \"Well, if I were you, I should show them a cold shoulder,\" said Mr. Cruse; \"and as to that intolerable puppy, I should take no further notice of him, except by cutting him dead.\" \n \n Mr. M\u0027Gabbery at last promised to follow his friend\u0027s advice, and so Miss Todd\u0027s picnic came to an end without bloodshed. \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2741/75465.html","bookId":1380,"book":{"id":1380,"title":"The Bertrams","description":"简介： This is undoubtedly the age of humanityas far, at least, as England is concerned.
