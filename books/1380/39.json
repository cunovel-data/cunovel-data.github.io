{"id":21508,"no":39,"title":"CHAPTER IX. THE TWO WIDOWS.","content":"The winter was now nearly over, and the travellers had determined to return to England. Whatever other good purpose the city of Cairo might or might not serve, it had restored Wilkinson to health. Bertram was sufficiently weary of living in a country in which the women go about with their faces hidden by long dirty stripes of calico, which they call veils, and in which that little which is seen of the ladies by no means creates a wish to see more. And Wilkinson, since the conversation which they had had at the Pyramids, was anxious to assume his own rights in the vicarage-house at Hurst Staple. So they decided on returning about the middle of March; but they decided also on visiting Suez before doing so. In these days men go from Cairo to Suez as they do from London to Birmingham—by railway; in those days—some ten or twelve years back, that is—they went in wooden boxes, and were dragged by mules through the desert. We cannot stay long at Suez, nor should I carry my reader there, even for a day, seeing how triste and dull the place is, had not our hero made an acquaintance there which for some time was likely to have a considerable effect on his future life. Suez is indeed a triste, unhappy, wretched place. It is a small oriental town, now much be-Europeanized, and in the process of being be-Anglicized. It is not so Beelzebub-ridden a spot as Alexandria, nor falling to pieces like Cairo. But it has neither water, air, nor verdure. No trees grow there, no rivers flow there. Men drink brine and eat goats; and the thermometer stands at eighty in the shade in winter. The oranges are the only luxury. There is a huge hotel, which contains long rows of hot cells, and a vast cave in which people eat. The interest of the place consists in Pharoah\u0027s passage over the Red Sea; but its future prosperity will be caused by a transit of a different nature:—the passage of the English to and from India will turn even Suez into an important town. Here the two travellers encountered a flood of Indians on their return home. The boat from Calcutta came in while they were there, and suddenly all the cells were tenanted, and the cave was full of spoiled children, tawny nurses, pale languid mothers, and dyspeptic fathers. These were to be fellow-travellers homewards with Bertram and Wilkinson. Neither of our friends regarded with favour the crowd which made them even more uncomfortable than they had been before. As Englishmen in such positions generally do, they kept themselves aloof and scowled, frowned at the children who whined in the nearest neighbourhood to them, and listened in disgust to the continuous chatter about punkahs, tiffins, and bungalows. But close to them, at the end of the long table, at the common dinner, sat two ladies, on whom it was almost impossible for them to frown. For be it known that at these hotels in Egypt, a man cannot order his dinner when he pleases. He must breakfast at nine, and dine at six, as others do—or go without. And whether he dine, or whether he do not, he must pay. The Medes and Persians were lax and pliable in their laws in comparison with these publicans. Both George and Arthur would have frowned if they could have done so; but on these two ladies it was impossible to frown. They were both young, and both pretty. George\u0027s neighbour was uncommonly pretty—was, indeed, one of the prettiest women that he had ever seen;—that any man could see anywhere. She was full of smiles too, and her smile was heavenly;—was full of words, and her words were witty. She who sat next Arthur was perhaps less attractive; but she had large soft eyes, which ever and anon she would raise to his face, and then let fall again to her plate in a manner which made sparks fly round the heart even of our somewhat sombre young Hampshire vicar. The four were soon in full conversation, apparently much to the disgust of two military-looking gentlemen who sat on the other side of the ladies. And it was evident that the military gentlemen and the ladies were, or ought to be, on terms of intimacy; for proffers of soup, and mutton, and wine were whispered low, and little attempts at confidential intercourse were made. But the proffers were rejected, and the attempts were in vain. The ladies preferred to have their plates and glasses filled by the strangers, turned their shoulders on their old friends with but scant courtesy, and were quite indifferent to the frowns which at last clouded those two military brows. And the brows of Major Biffin and Captain M\u0027Gramm were clouded. They had been filling the plates and glasses of these two ladies all the way from Calcutta; they had walked with them every day on deck, had fetched their chairs, picked up their handkerchiefs, and looked after their bottled beer at tiffin-time with an assiduity which is more than commendable in such warm latitudes. And now to be thrown on one side for two travelling Englishmen, one in a brown coat and the other in a black one—for two muffs, who had never drunk sangaree or sat under a punkah! This was unpleasant to Major Biffin and Captain M\u0027Gramm. But then why had the major and the captain boasted of the favours they had daily received, to that soft-looking, superannuated judge, and to their bilious friend, Dr. O\u0027Shaughnessy? The judge and the doctor had of course their female allies, and had of course repeated to them all the boasts of the fortunate major and of the fortunate captain. And was it not equally of course that these ladies should again repeat the same to Mrs. Cox and Mrs. Price? For she who was so divinely perfect was Mrs. Cox, and she of the soft, lustrous eyes was Mrs. Price. Those who think that such a course was not natural know little of voyages home from Calcutta to Southampton. But the major, who had been the admirer of Mrs. Cox, had done more than this—had done worse, we may say. The world of the good ship \"Lahore,\" which was bringing them all home, had declared ever since they had left Point de Galle, that the major and Mrs. Cox were engaged. Now, had the major, in boasting of his favours, boasted also of his engagement, no harm perhaps might have come of it. The sweet good-nature of the widow might have overlooked that offence. But he had boasted of the favours and pooh-poohed the engagement! \"Hinc ill? lacrym?.\" And who shall say that the widow was wrong? And as to the other widow, Mrs. Price, she was tired of Captain M\u0027Gramm. A little fact had transpired about Captain M\u0027Gramm, namely, that he was going home to his wife. And therefore the two ladies, who had conspired together to be civil to the two warriors, now conspired together to be uncivil to them. In England such things are done, as it were, behind the scenes: there these little quarrels are managed in private. But a passage home from India admits of but little privacy; there is no behind the scenes. The two widows were used to this, and quarrelled with their military admirers in public without any compunction. \"Hinc ill? lacrym?.\" But the major was not inclined to shed his tears without an effort. He had pooh-poohed the idea of marrying Mrs. Cox; but like many another man in similar circumstances, he was probably willing enough to enter into such an arrangement now that the facility of doing so was taken from him. It is possible that Mrs. Cox, when she turned her pretty shoulder on Major Biffin, may herself have understood this phasis of human nature. The major was a handsome man, with well-brushed hair, well-trimmed whiskers, a forehead rather low, but very symmetrical, a well-shaped nose, and a small, pursy mouth. The worst of his face was that you could by no means remember it. But he knew himself to be a handsome man, and he could not understand how he could be laid aside for so ugly a lout as this stranger from England. Captain M\u0027Gramm was not a handsome man, and he was aware that he fought his battle under the disadvantage of a wife. But he had impudence enough to compensate him for this double drawback. During this first dinner, Arthur Wilkinson was not more than coldly civil to Mrs. Price; but Bertram became after a while warmly civil to Mrs. Cox. It is so very nice to be smiled on by the prettiest woman in the room; and it was long since he had seen the smile of any pretty woman! Indeed, for the last eighteen months he had had but little to do with such smiles. Before dinner was over, Mrs. Cox had explained to Bertram that both she and her friend Mrs. Price were in deep affliction. They had recently lost their husbands—the one, by cholera; that was poor dear Cox, who had been collector of the Honourable Company\u0027s taxes at Panjabee. Whereas, Lieutenant Price, of the 71st Native Bengal Infantry, had succumbed to—here Mrs. Cox shook her head, and whispered, and pointed to the champagne-glass which Bertram was in the act of filling for her. Poor Cox had gone just eight months; but Price had taken his last glass within six. And so Bertram knew all about it. And then there was a great fuss in packing the travellers into the wooden boxes. It seems that they had all made up their own parties by sixes, that being the number of which one box was supposed to be capable. But pretty women are capricious, and neither Mrs. Price nor Mrs. Cox were willing to abide by any such arrangement. When the time came for handing them in, they both objected to the box pointed out to them by Major Biffin—refused to be lifted in by the arms of Captain M\u0027Gramm—got at last into another vacant box with the assistance of our friends—summoned their dingy nurses and babies into the same box (for each was so provided)—and then very prettily made way for Mr. Bertram and Mr. Wilkinson. And so they went across the desert. Then they all stayed a night at Cairo, and then they went on to Alexandria. And by the time that they were embarked in a boat together, on their way to that gallant first-class steamer, the \"Cagliari,\" they were as intimate as though they had travelled round the world together, and had been as long about it as Captain Cook. \"What will you take with you, Mrs. Cox?\" said Bertram, as he stood up in the boat with the baby on one arm, while with the other he handed the lady towards the ship\u0027s ladder. \"A good ducking,\" said Mrs. Cox, with a cheery laugh, as at the moment a dashing wave covered them with its spray. \"And I\u0027ve got it too, with a vengeance. Ha! ha! Take care of the baby, whatever you do; and if she falls over, mind you go after her.\" And with another little peal of silver ringing laughter, she tripped up the side of the ship, and Bertram, with the baby, followed after her. \"She is such a giddy thing,\" said Mrs. Price, turning her soft eyes on poor Arthur Wilkinson. \"Oh, laws! I know I shall be drowned. Do hold me.\" And Arthur Wilkinson did hold her, and nearly carried her up into the ship. As he did so, his mind would fly off to Adela Gauntlet; but his arms and legs were not the less at the service of Mrs. Price. \"And now look after the places,\" said Mrs. Cox; \"you haven\u0027t a moment to lose. And look here, Mr. Bertram, mind, I won\u0027t sit next to Major Biffin. And, for heaven\u0027s sake, don\u0027t let us be near that fellow M\u0027Gramm.\" And so Bertram descended into the salon to place their cards in the places at which they were to sit for dinner. \"Two and two; opposite to each other,\" sang out Mrs. Cox, as he went. There was a sweetness in her voice, a low, mellow cheeriness in her tone, which, combined with her beauty, went far to atone for the nature of what she said; and Bertram not unwillingly obeyed her behests. \"Oh, my blessed baby!\" said Mrs. Price, as the nurse handed her the child—which, however, she immediately handed back. \"How can I thank you enough, Mr. Wilkinson? What should we have done without you? I wonder whether it\u0027s near tiffin. I am so faint.\" \"Shall I fetch you anything?\" said he. \"If you could get me a glass of porter. But I don\u0027t think they\u0027ll give it you. They are so uncivil!\" Arthur went for the beer; but went in vain. The steward said that lunch would be ready at twelve o\u0027clock. \"They are such brutes!\" said Mrs. Price. \"Well, I suppose I must wait.\" And she again turned her eyes upon Arthur, and he again thought of Adela Gauntlet. And then there was the ordinary confusion of a starting ship. Men and women were hurrying about after their luggage, asking all manner of unreasonable questions. Ladies were complaining of their berths, and servants asking where on hearth they were to sleep. Gentlemen were swearing that they had been shamefully doubled up—that is, made to lie with two or three men in the same cabin; and friends were contriving to get commodious seats for dinner. The officers of the ship were all busy, treating with apparent indifference the thousand questions that were asked them on every side; and all was bustle, confusion, hurry, and noise. And then they were off. The pistons of the engine moved slowly up and down, the huge cranks revolved, and the waters under the bow rippled and gave way. They were off, and the business of the voyage commenced. The younger people prepared for their flirtations, the mothers unpacked their children\u0027s clothes, and the elderly gentlemen lighted their cigars. \"What very queer women they are!\" said Arthur, walking the deck with his cousin. \"But very pretty, and very agreeable. I like them both.\" \"Don\u0027t you think them too free and easy?\" \"Ah, you must not judge of them by women who have lived in England, who have always had the comfort of well-arranged homes. They have been knocked about, ill used, and forced to bear hardships as men bear them; but still there is about them so much that is charming. They are so frank!\" \"Yes, very frank,\" said Arthur. \"It is well to see the world on all sides,\" said George. \"For myself, I think that we are lucky to have come across them—that is, if Major Biffin does not cut my throat.\" \"I hope Captain M\u0027Gramm won\u0027t cut mine. He looked as though he would.\" \"Did you ever see such an ass as that Biffin? I don\u0027t wonder that she has become sick of him; and then he has behaved so very badly to her. I really do pity her. She has told me all about it.\" \"And so has Mrs. Price told me all about Captain M\u0027Gramm.\" \"Has she? Well! It seems that he, Biffin, has taken advantage of her frank, easy manner, and talked of her to every man in the ship. I think she has been quite right to cut him.\" And so they discussed the two ladies. And at last Mrs. Price got her porter, and Mrs. Cox got her pale ale. \"I do like pale ale,\" said she; \"I suppose it\u0027s vulgar, but I can\u0027t help that. What amuses me is, that so many ladies drink it who are quite ashamed to say they like it.\" \"They take it for their health\u0027s sake,\" said Bertram. \"Oh, yes; of course they do. Mrs. Bangster takes her half-pint of brandy every night for her health\u0027s sake, no doubt. Would you believe it, Mr. Bertram, the doctor absolutely had to take her out of the saloon one night in the \u0027Lahore\u0027? Didn\u0027t he, Mrs. Price?\" \"Indeed he did. I never was so shocked.—Just a little drop more to freshen it.\" And Mr. Wilkinson gave her another glass of porter. Before they reached Malta, all the passengers from India had agreed that Mrs. Cox and Bertram would certainly make a match of it, and that Wilkinson was also in danger. \"Did you ever see such flirts?\" said Mrs. Bangster to Dr. O\u0027Shaughnessey. \"What an escape Biffin has had!\" \"She is a deuced pretty woman, Mrs. Bangster; and I\u0027ll tell you what: Biffin would give one of his eyes to get her back again if he could.\" \"Laws, doctor! You don\u0027t mean to tell me that he ever meant to marry that thing?\" \"I don\u0027t know what he meant before; but he would mean it now, if he got the opportunity.\" Here Captain M\u0027Gramm joined them. \"Well, Mac,\" said the doctor, \"what news with the widow?\" \"Widow! they\u0027d all be widows if they could, I believe.\" \"Indeed, I wouldn\u0027t, for one,\" said Mrs. Bangster. \"B. is a deal too well off where he is. Ha! ha! ha!\" \"But what about Mrs. Price—eh, Mac?\" continued the doctor. \"There she is. You\u0027d better go and ask her yourself. You don\u0027t suppose I ever cared about such a woman as that? Only I do say this: if she goes on behaving herself in that way, some one ought to speak to the captain.\" But Mrs. Cox and Mrs. Price went on their own way, heeding such menaces not at all; and by the time they had reached Malta, they had told the whole history of their lives to the two gentlemen—and perhaps something more. At Malta they remained about six hours, and the four dined on shore together. Bertram bought for them Maltese veils and bad cameos; and Wilkinson, misled by such an example, was forced to do the same. These treasures were not hidden under a bushel when they returned to the ship; and Dr. O\u0027Shaughnessey, Mrs. Bangster, the fat judge, and a host of others, were more sure than ever that both the widows were re-engaged. And Arthur Wilkinson was becoming frightened in his mind. \"Upon my word,\" said he, as he and George were walking the deck at sunrise the next morning, \"upon my word, I am getting very tired of this woman, and I really think we are making a show of ourselves.\" \"Making a show of ourselves! What do you mean?\" \"Why, walking with them every day, and always sitting next to them.\" \"As to sitting next to them, we can\u0027t help that. Everybody always sits in the same place, and one must sit next some one; and it wouldn\u0027t be kind to leave them to walk alone.\" \"I think we may overdo it, you know.\" \"Ah, well,\" said George, \"you have some one else to think about. I have no one, unless it be this widow. She is kind to me, and as to what the world says, I care nothing about it.\" On that day Wilkinson was busy with his books, and did not walk with Mrs. Price—a piece of neglect which sat uneasily on that lady\u0027s mind. But at ten o\u0027clock, as usual, Bertram was pacing the deck with Mrs. Cox. \"What is the matter with your friend?\" said she. \"Oh, nothing. He is home-sick, I suppose.\" \"I hope he has not quarrelled with Minnie.\" For the two ladies had come to call each other by their Christian names when they were in company with the gentlemen; and Bertram had once or twice used that of Mrs. Cox, not exactly in speaking to her, but in speaking of her in her presence. \"Oh dear, no,\" said Bertram. \"Because it is so odd he should not give her his arm as usual. I suppose you will be treating me so as we draw nearer to Southampton?\" And she looked up at him with a bewitching smile, and pressed gently on his arm, and then let her eyes fall upon the deck. My brother, when you see these tricks played upon other men, the gall rises black within your breast, and you loudly condemn wiles which are so womanly, but which are so unworthy of women. But how do you feel when they are played upon yourself? The gall is not so black, the condemnation less loud; your own merit seems to excuse the preference which is shown you; your heart first forgives and then applauds. Is it not so, my brother, with you? So it was, at least, with George Bertram. \"What! treating you with neglect, because we are soon to part?\" \"Yes, exactly so; just that; because we are soon to part. That is what makes it so bitter. We have been such good friends, haven\u0027t we?\" \"And why should we not remain so? Why should we talk of parting? We are both going to England.\" \"England! Yes, but England is a large place. Come, let us lean on the taffrail, and look at the dolphins. There is that horrid fellow eyeing me, as he always does; Major Biffin, I mean. Is he not exactly like a barber\u0027s block? I do so hate him!\" \"But he doesn\u0027t hate you, Mrs. Cox.\" \"Doesn\u0027t he? Well then, he may if he likes. But don\u0027t let\u0027s talk of him. Talk to me about England, Mr. Bertram. Sometimes I do so long to be there—and then sometimes I don\u0027t.\" \"You don\u0027t—why not?\" \"Do you?\" \"No, I do not; I tell you frankly. I\u0027d sooner be here with you to talk to, with you to look at.\" \"Psha, Mr. Bertram! what nonsense! I can\u0027t conceive that any woman can ever be worth looking at on board a ship—much less such a one as I! I know you\u0027re dying to get home.\" \"I might be if I had a home.\" \"Is your home with that uncle of yours?\" She had heard so much of his family; but he had as yet spoken to her no word about Caroline. \"I wonder what he would say if he could see you now leaning here and talking to me.\" \"If he has any knowledge of human nature, he would say that I was a very happy fellow.\" \"And are you?\" As she asked him, she looked up into his face with such an arch smile that he could not find it in his heart to condemn her. \"What will you think of my gallantry if I say no?\" \"I hate gallantry; it is all bosh. I wish I were a man, and that I could call you Bertram, and that you would call me Cox.\" \"I would sooner call you Annie.\" \"Would you? But that wouldn\u0027t be right, would it?\" And her hand, which was still within his arm, was pressed upon it with ever so light a pressure. \"I don\u0027t know why it should be wrong to call people by their Christian names. Should you be angry if I called you Annie?\" \"That might depend— Tell me this, Mr. Bertram: How many other ladies do you call by their Christian names?\" \"A dozen or two.\" \"I\u0027ll be bound you do.\" \"And may I add you to the number?\" \"No, Mr. Bertram; certainly not.\" \"May I not? So intimate as we have become, I thought—\" \"I will not be one of a dozen or two.\" And as she answered him, she dropped her tone of raillery, and spoke in a low, soft, sweet voice. It sounded so sweet on Bertram\u0027s ear. \"But if there be not one—not one other; not one other now—what then, Annie?\" \"Not one other now?—Did you say now? Then there has been one.\" \"Yes; there has been one.\" \"And she—what of her?\" \"It is a tale I cannot tell.\" \"Not to me? I should not like you the less for telling me. Do tell me.\" And she pressed her hand again upon his arm. \"I have known there was something that made you unhappy.\" \"Have you?\" \"Oh, yes. I have long known that. And I have so wished to be a comfort to you—if I could. I, too, have had great suffering.\" \"I am sure you have.\" \"Ah! yes. I did not suffer less because he had been unkind to me.\" And she put her handkerchief to her eyes, and then brought her hand again upon his arm. \"But tell me of her—your one. She is not your one now—is she, Mr. Bertram?\" \"No, Annie; not now.\" \"Is she—?\" And she hesitated to ask whether the lady were dead, or married to some one else. It might, after all, only be a lovers\u0027 quarrel. \"I drove her from me—and now she is a wife.\" \"Drove her from you! Alas! alas!\" said Mrs. Cox, with the sweetest emphasis of sympathy. But the result of her inquiries was not unsatisfactory to her. \"I don\u0027t know why I should have told you this,\" said he. \"I am so glad you have,\" she replied. \"But now that I have told you—\" \"Well—\" \"Now may I call you Annie?\" \"You have done so two or three times.\" \"But may I?\" \"If it please you, you may.\" And the words, though whispered very low, fell clearly upon his ear. \"Dearest Annie!\" \"But I did not say you might call me that.\" \"But you are.\" \"Am I?\" \"Dearest—all but she. Will that make you angry with me?\" \"No, not angry; but—\" \"But what?\" She looked up at him, pouting with her lip. There was a half-smile on her mouth, and half a tear in her eyes; and her shoulder leant against him, and her heart palpitated. She had never been so beautiful, never so attractive. \"But what—? What would you say, Annie?\" \"I would say this.—But I know you will think me very bold.\" \"I shall not think you too bold if you will say the truth.\" \"Then I would say this—that if I loved a man, I could love him quite as fondly as she loved you.\" \"Could you, Annie?\" \"I could. But he should not drive me from him, as you say you did her; never—never—never. He might kill me if he would; but if I once had told him that I loved him, I would never leave him afterwards.\" \"Tell me so, Annie.\" \"No, Mr. Bertram. We have not known each other long enough.\" And now she took her hand from his arm, and let it drop by her side. \"Tell me so, dear Annie,\" he repeated; and he tried to regain her hand. \"There is the luncheon-bell; and since Mr. Wilkinson won\u0027t go to Mrs. Price, I must do so.\" \"Shall I go?\" said he. \"Do; I will go down by myself.\" \"But you love me, Annie?—say that you love me.\" \"Nonsense. Here is that fellow, Biffin. Do you go for Mrs. Price—leave me to myself.\" \"Don\u0027t go down stairs with him.\" \"You may be sure I won\u0027t—nor with you either this morning. I am half inclined to be angry with you.\" And so saying, she moved away. \"Ah, me! what have I done!\" said Bertram to himself, as he went upon his mission. \"But she is a sweet creature; as beautiful as Hebe; and why should I be wretched for ever?\" She had moved towards the companion-ladder, and as she did so, Major Biffin followed her. \"Will you not allow me to give you an arm down stairs?\" said he. \"Thank you, Major Biffin. It is rather crowded, and I can go better alone.\" \"You did not find the stairs in the \u0027Lahore\u0027 too crowded.\" \"Oh, yes, I did; very often. And the \u0027Lahore\u0027 and the \u0027Cagliari\u0027 are different things.\" \"Very different it seems. But the sea itself is not so fickle as a woman.\" And Major Biffin became a picture of injured innocence. \"And the land is not so dry as a man, Major Biffin; that is, some men. Ha! ha! ha! Good-morning, Major Biffin.\" And so saying, she went down by herself. On the next day, Arthur still preferred his book to walking with Mrs. Price; and that lady was once again seen with her arm in that of Captain M\u0027Gramm\u0027s. This made a considerable consternation in the ship; and in the afternoon there was a slight quarrel between the two ladies. \"And so, Minnie, you are going to take up with that fellow again?\" \"No; I am not. But I don\u0027t choose to be left altogether to myself.\" \"I never would have anything to say to a married man that drops his wife as he does.\" \"I don\u0027t care two straws for him, or his wife. But I don\u0027t want to make myself conspicuous by a quarrel.\" \"I\u0027m sure Wilkinson will be annoyed,\" said Mrs. Cox. \"He\u0027s a muff,\" said Mrs. Price. \"And, if I am not mistaken, I know some one else who is another.\" \"Who do you mean, Mrs. Price?\" \"I mean Mr. Bertram, Mrs. Cox.\" \"Oh, I dare say he is a muff; that\u0027s because he\u0027s attentive to me instead of leaving me to myself, as somebody does to somebody else. I understand all about that, my dear.\" \"You understand a great deal, I have no doubt,\" said Mrs. Price. \"I always heard as much.\" \"It seems to me you understand nothing, or you wouldn\u0027t be walking about with Captain M\u0027Gramm,\" said Mrs. Cox. And then they parted, before blood was absolutely drawn between them. At dinner that day they were not very comfortable together. Mrs. Price accepted Mr. Wilkinson\u0027s ordinary courtesies in a stately way, thanking him for filling her glass and looking after her plate, in a tone and with a look which made it plain to all that things were not progressing well between them. George and his Annie did get on somewhat better; but even they were not quite at their ease. Mrs. Cox had said, before luncheon, that she had not known Mr. Bertram long enough to declare her love for him. But the hours between luncheon and dinner might have been a sufficient prolongation of the period of their acquaintance. George, however, had not repeated the question; and had, indeed, not been alone with her for five minutes during the afternoon. That evening, Wilkinson again warned his friend that he might be going too far with Mrs. Cox; that he might say that which he could neither fulfil nor retract. For Wilkinson clearly conceived it to be impossible that Bertram should really intend to marry this widow. \"And why should I not marry her?\" said George. \"She would not suit you, nor make you happy.\" \"What right have I to think that any woman will suit me? or what chance is there that any woman will make me happy? Is it not all leather and prunella? She is pretty and clever, soft and feminine. Where shall I find a nicer toy to play with? You forget, Arthur, that I have had my day-dreams, and been roused from them somewhat roughly. With you, the pleasure is still to come.\" After this they turned in and went to bed.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2741/75495.html","bookId":1380,"book":{"id":1380,"title":"The Bertrams","description":"简介： This is undoubtedly the age of humanityas far, at least, as England is concerned.
