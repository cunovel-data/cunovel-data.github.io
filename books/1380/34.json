{"id":21503,"no":34,"title":"CHAPTER IV. MRS. MADDEN\u0027S BALL.","content":"Two days after the dinner, George Bertram called in Eaton Square and saw Lady Harcourt; but, as it happened, she was not alone. Their interview on this occasion was not in any great degree embarrassing to either of them. He did not stay long; and as strangers were present, he was able to talk freely on indifferent subjects. Lady Harcourt probably did not talk much, but she looked as though she did. And then Adela Gauntlet came up to town for a month; and George, though he was on three or four occasions in Eaton Square, never saw Caroline alone; but he became used to seeing her and being with her. The strangeness of their meeting wore itself away: he could speak to her without reserve on the common matters of life, and found that he had intense delight in doing so. Adela Gauntlet was present at all these interviews, and in her heart of hearts condemned them bitterly; but she could say nothing to Caroline. They had been friends—real friends; but Caroline was now almost like stone to her. This visit of Adela\u0027s had been a long promise—yes, very long; for the visit, when first promised, was to have been made to Mrs. Bertram. One knows how these promises still live on. Caroline had pressed it even when she felt that Adela\u0027s presence could no longer be of comfort to her; and Adela would not now refuse, lest in doing so she might seem to condemn. But she felt that Caroline Harcourt could never be to her what Caroline Bertram would have been. Lady Harcourt did whatever in her lay to amuse her guest; but Adela was one who did not require much amusing. Had there been friendship between her and her friend, the month would have run by all too quickly; but, as it was, before it was over she wished herself again even at Littlebath. Bertram dined there twice, and once went with them to some concert. He met them in the Park, and called; and then there was a great evening gathering in Eaton Square, and he was there. Caroline was careful on all occasions to let her husband know when she met Bertram, and he as often, in some shape, expressed his satisfaction. \"He\u0027ll marry Adela Gauntlet; you\u0027ll see if he does not,\" he said to her, after one of their dinners in Eaton Square. \"She is very pretty, very; and it will be all very nice; only I wish that one of them had a little money to go on with.\" Caroline answered nothing to this: she never did make him any answers; but she felt quite sure in her own heart that he would not marry Adela Gauntlet. And had she confessed the truth to herself, would she have wished him to do so? Adela saw and disapproved; she saw much and could not but disapprove of all. She saw that there was very little sympathy between the husband and wife, and that that little was not on the increase.—Very little! nay, but was there any? Caroline did not say much of her lot in life; but the few words that did fall from her seemed to be full of scorn for all that she had around her, and for him who had given it all. She seemed to say, \"There—this is that for which I have striven—these ashes on which I now step, and sleep, and feed, which are gritty between my teeth, and foul to my touch! See, here is my reward! Do you not honour me for having won it?\" And then it appeared that Sir Henry Harcourt had already learned how to assume the cross brow of a captious husband; that the sharp word was already spoken on light occasions—spoken without cause and listened to with apparent indifference. Even before Adela such words were spoken, and then Caroline would smile bitterly, and turn her face towards her friend, as though she would say, \"See, see what it is to be the wife of so fine a man, so great a man! What a grand match have I not made for myself!\" But though her looks spoke thus, no word of complaint fell from her lips—and no word of confidence. We have said that Sir Henry seemed to encourage these visits which Bertram made to Eaton Square; and for a time he did so—up to the time of that large evening-party which was given just before Adela\u0027s return to Littlebath. But on that evening, Adela thought she saw a deeper frown than usual on the brows of the solicitor-general, as he turned his eyes to a couch on which his lovely wife was sitting, and behind which George Bertram was standing, but so standing that he could speak and she could hear. And then Adela bethought herself, that though she could say nothing to Caroline, it might not be equally impossible to say something to Bertram. There had been between them a sort of confidence, and if there was any one to whom Adela could now speak freely, it was to him. They each knew something of each other\u0027s secrets, and each of them, at least, trusted the other. But this, if it be done at all, must be done on that evening. There was no probability that they would meet again before her departure. This was the only house in which they did meet, and here Adela had no wish to see him more. \"I am come to say good-bye to you,\" she said, the first moment she was able to speak to him alone. \"To say good-bye! Is your visit over so soon?\" \"I go on Thursday.\" \"Well, I shall see you again, for I shall come on purpose to make my adieux.\" \"No, Mr. Bertram; do not do that.\" \"But I certainly shall.\" \"No;\" and she put out her little hand, and gently—oh! so gently—touched his arm. \"And why not? Why should I not come to see you? I have not so many friends that I can afford to lose you.\" \"You shall not lose me, nor would I willingly lose you. But, Mr. Bertram—\" \"Well, Miss Gauntlet?\" \"Are you right to be here at all?\" The whole tone, and temper, and character of his face altered as he answered her quickly and sharply—\"If not, the fault lies with Sir Henry Harcourt, who, with some pertinacity, induced me to come here. But why is it wrong that I should be here?—foolish it may be.\" \"That is what I mean. I did not say wrong; did I? Do not think that I imagine evil.\" \"It may be foolish,\" continued Bertram, as though he had not heard her last words. \"But if so, the folly has been his.\" \"If he is foolish, is that reason why you should not be wise?\" \"And what is it you fear, Adela? What is the injury that will come? Will it be to me, or to her, or to Harcourt?\" \"No injury, no real injury—I am sure of that. But may not unhappiness come of it? Does it seem to you that she is happy?\" \"Happy! Which of us is happy? Which of us is not utterly wretched? She is as happy as you are? and Sir Henry, I have no doubt, is as happy as I am.\" \"In what you say, Mr. Bertram, you do me injustice; I am not unhappy.\" \"Are you not? then I congratulate you on getting over the troubles consequent on a true heart.\" \"I did not mean in any way to speak of myself; I have cares, regrets, and sorrows, as have most of us; but I have no cause of misery which I cannot assuage.\" \"Well, you are fortunate; that is all I can say.\" \"But Caroline I can see is not happy; and, Mr. Bertram, I fear that your coming here will not make her more so.\" She had said her little word, meaning it so well. But perhaps she had done more harm than good. He did not come again to Eaton Square till after she was gone; but very shortly after that he did so. Adela had seen that short, whispered conversation between Lady Harcourt and Bertram—that moment, as it were, of confidence; and so, also, had Sir Henry; and yet it had been but for a moment. \"Lady Harcourt,\" Bertram had said, \"how well you do this sort of thing!\" \"Do I?\" she answered. \"Well, one ought to do something well.\" \"Do you mean to say that your excellence is restricted to this?\" \"Pretty nearly; such excellence as there is.\" \"I should have thought—\" and then he paused. \"You are not coming to reproach me, I hope,\" she said. \"Reproach you, Lady Harcourt! No; my reproaches, silent or expressed, never fall on your head.\" \"Then you must be much altered;\" and as she said these last words, in what was hardly more than a whisper, she saw some lady in a distant part of the room to whom some attention might be considered to be due, and rising from her seat she walked away across the room. It was very shortly after that Adela had spoken to him. For many a long and bitter day, Bertram had persuaded himself that she had not really loved him. He had doubted it when she had first told him so calmly that it was necessary that their marriage should be postponed for years; he had doubted it much when he found her, if not happy, at least contented under that postponement; doubt had become almost certainty when he learnt that she discussed his merits with such a one as Henry Harcourt; but on that day, at Richmond, when he discovered that the very secrets of his heart were made subject of confidential conversation with this man, he had doubted it no longer. Then he had gone to her, and his reception proved to him that his doubts had been too well founded—his certainty only too sure. And so he had parted with her—as we all know. But now he began to doubt his doubts—to be less certain of his certainty. That she did not much love Sir Henry, that was very apparent; that she could not listen to his slightest word without emotion—that, too, he could perceive; that Adela conceived that she still loved him, and that his presence there was therefore dangerous—that also had been told to him. Was it then possible that he, loving this woman as he did—having never ceased in his love for one moment, having still loved her with his whole heart, his whole strength—that he had flung her from him while her heart was still his own? Could it be that she, during their courtship, should have seemed so cold and yet had loved him? A thousand times he had reproached her in his heart for being worldly; but now the world seemed to have no charms for her. A thousand times he had declared that she cared only for the outward show of things, but these outward shows were now wholly indifferent to her. That they in no degree contributed to her happiness, or even to her contentment, that was made manifest enough to him. And then these thoughts drove him wild, and he began to ask himself whether there could be yet any comfort in the fact that she had loved him, and perhaps loved him still. The motives by which men are actuated in their conduct are not only various, but mixed. As Bertram thought in this way concerning Lady Harcourt—the Caroline Waddington that had once belonged to himself—he proposed to himself no scheme of infamy, no indulgence of a disastrous love, no ruin for her whom the world now called so fortunate; but he did think that, if she still loved him, it would be pleasant to sit and talk with her; pleasant to feel some warmth in her hand; pleasant that there should be some confidence in her voice. And so he resolved—but, no, there was no resolve; but he allowed it to come to pass that his intimacy in Eaton Square should not be dropped. And then he bethought himself of the part which his friend Harcourt had played in this matter, and speculated as to how that pleasant fellow had cheated him out of his wife. What Adela had said might be very true, but why should he regard Sir Henry\u0027s happiness? why regard any man\u0027s happiness, or any woman\u0027s? Who had regarded him? So he hired a horse, and rode in the Park when he knew Lady Harcourt would be there, dined with Baron Brawl because Lady Harcourt was to dine there, and went to a ball at Mrs. Madden\u0027s for the same reason. All which the solicitor-general now saw, and did not press his friend to take a part at any more of his little dinners. What may have passed on the subject between Sir Henry and his wife cannot be said. A man does not willingly accuse his wife of even the first germ of infidelity; does not willingly suggest to her that any one is of more moment to her than himself. It is probable that his brow became blacker than it had been, that his words were less courteous, and his manner less kind; but of Bertram himself, it may be presumed that he said nothing. It might, however, have been easy for Caroline to perceive that he no longer wished to have his old friend at his house. At Mrs. Madden\u0027s ball, Bertram asked her to dance with him, and she did stand up for a quadrille. Mr. Madden was a rich young man, in Parliament, and an intimate friend both of Sir Henry\u0027s and of Bertram\u0027s. Caroline had danced with him—being her first performance of that nature since her marriage; and having done so, she could not, as she said to herself, refuse Mr. Bertram. So they stood up; and the busy solicitor-general, who showed himself for five minutes in the room, saw them moving, hand-in-hand together, in the figure of the dance. And as he so moved, Bertram himself could hardly believe in the reality of his position. What if any one had prophesied to him three months since that he would be dancing with Caroline Harcourt! \"Adela did not stay with you long,\" said he, as they were standing still. \"No, not very long. I do not think she is fond of London;\" and then they were again silent till their turn for dancing was over. \"No; I don\u0027t think she is,\" said Bertram, \"nor am I. I should not care if I were to leave it for ever. Do you like London, Lady Harcourt?\" \"Oh, yes; as well as any other place. I don\u0027t think it much signifies—London, or Littlebath, or New Zealand.\" They were then both silent for a moment, till Bertram again spoke, with an effort that was evident in his voice. \"You used not to be so indifferent in such matters.\" \"Used!\" \"Has all the world so changed that nothing is any longer of any interest?\" \"The world has changed, certainly—with me.\" \"And with me also, Lady Harcourt. The world has changed with both of us. But Fortune, while she has been crushing me, has been very kind to you.\" \"Has she? Well, perhaps she has—as kind, at any rate, as I deserve. But you may be sure of this—I do not complain of her.\" And then they were again silent. \"I wonder whether you ever think of old days?\" he said, after a pause. \"At any rate, I never talk of them, Mr. Bertram.\" \"No; I suppose not. One should not talk of them. But out of a full heart the mouth will speak. Constant thoughts will break forth in words. There is nothing else left to me of which I can think.\" Any one looking at her face as she answered him would have little dreamed how much was passing through her mind, how much was weighing on her heart. She commanded not only her features, but even her colour, and the motion of her eyes. No anger flashed from them; there was no blush of indignation as she answered him in that crowded room. And yet her words were indignant enough, and there was anger, too, in that low tone which reached his ear so plainly, but which reached no further. \"And whose doing has this been? Why is it that I may not think of past times? Why is it that all thought, all memories are denied to me? Who was it that broke the cup at the very fountain?\" \"Was it I?\" \"Did you ever think of your prayers? \u0027Forgive us our trespasses.\u0027 But you, in your pride—you could forgive nothing. And now you dare to twit me with my fortune!\" \"Lady Harcourt!\" \"I will sit down, if you please, now. I do not know why I speak thus.\" And then, without further words, she caused herself to be led away, and sitting down between two old dowagers, debarred him absolutely from the power of another word. Immediately after this he left the house; but she remained for another hour—remained and danced with young Lord Echo, who was a Whig lordling; and with Mr. Twisleton, whose father was a Treasury secretary. They both talked to her about Harcourt, and the great speech he was making at that moment; and she smiled and looked so beautiful, that when they got together at one end of the supper-table, they declared that Harcourt was out-and-out the luckiest dog of his day; and questioned his right to monopolize such a treasure. And had he been cruel? had he been unforgiving? had he denied to her that pardon which it behoved him so often to ask for himself? This was the question which Bertram was now forced to put to himself. And that other question, which he could now answer but in one way. Had he then been the cause of his own shipwreck? Had he driven his own bark on the rocks while the open channel was there clear before him? Had she not now assured him of her love, though no word of tenderness had passed her lips? And whose doing had it been? Yes, certainly; it had been his own doing. The conviction which thus came upon him did not add much to his comfort. There was but little consolation to him now in the assurance that she had loved, and did love him. He had hitherto felt himself to be an injured man; but now he had to feel that he himself had committed the injury. \"Whose doing has it been? You—you in your pride, could forgive nothing!\" These words rang in his ears; his memory repeated to him hourly the tone in which they had been spoken. She had accused him of destroying all her hopes for this world—and he had answered not a word to the accusation. On the morning after that ball at Mrs. Madden\u0027s, Sir Henry came into his wife\u0027s room while she was still dressing. \"By-the-by,\" said he, \"I saw you at Mrs. Madden\u0027s last night.\" \"Yes; I perceived that you were there for a moment,\" Caroline answered. \"You were dancing. I don\u0027t know that I ever saw you dancing before.\" \"I have not done so since I was married. In former days I used to be fond of it.\" \"Ah, yes; when you were at Littlebath. It did not much matter then what you did in that way; but—\" \"Does it matter more now, Sir Henry?\" \"Well, if it would entail no great regret, I would rather that you did not dance. It is all very nice for girls.\" \"You do not mean to say that married women—\" \"I do not mean to say anything of the kind. One man has one idea, and another another. Some women also are not placed in so conspicuous a position as you are.\" \"Why did you not tell me your wishes before?\" \"It did not occur to me. I did not think it probable that you would dance. May I understand that you will give it up?\" \"As you direct me to do so, of course I shall.\" \"Direct! I do not direct, I only request.\" \"It is the same thing, exactly. I will not dance again. I should have felt the prohibition less had I been aware of your wishes before I had offended.\" \"Well, if you choose to take it in that light, I cannot help it. Good-morning. I shall not dine at home to-day.\" And so the solicitor-general went his way, and his wife remained sitting motionless at her dressing-table. They had both of them already become aware that the bargain they had made was not a wise one.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2741/75490.html","bookId":1380,"book":{"id":1380,"title":"The Bertrams","description":"简介： This is undoubtedly the age of humanityas far, at least, as England is concerned.
