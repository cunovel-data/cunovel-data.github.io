{"id":21498,"no":29,"title":"CHAPTER XIV. MRS. LEAKE OF RISSBURY.","content":"Adela Gauntlet reached Littlebath without any adventures, and at the station she met Miss Baker ready to take her and her boxes in charge. She soon learned what was to be her fate for that autumn. It was imperatively necessary that Miss Baker should go up to town in a week or two. \"There are such hundreds of things to be done about furniture and all that, you know,\" said Miss Baker, looking rather grand as she spoke of her niece\u0027s great match; and yet doing so with the least possible amount of intentional pride or vanity. Adela, of course, acknowledged that there must be hundreds of things, and expressed her deepest regret that she should be so much in the way. Perhaps she almost wished that she had remained at Hurst Staple. \"Not at all in the way, my dear,\" said Miss Baker; \"I shall be back again in a week at the furthest, and Miss Todd will be delighted to have you for that time. Indeed, she would be very much disappointed now, and offended too if you did not go. But all the same, I would not leave you, only that Sir Henry insists that Caroline should choose all the things herself; and of course he has not time to go with her—and then the responsibility is so great. Why, I suppose she will have to lay out about two thousand pounds!\" \"But what sort of a person is Miss Todd?\" asked Adela. \"Oh, an extremely nice person; you\u0027ll like her amazingly—so lively, so good-natured, so generous; and very clever too. Perhaps, for her age, she\u0027s a little too fond—\" \"Too fond of what? You were going to say dress, I suppose.\" \"No, indeed. I can\u0027t say that there\u0027s anything to blame her for in that. She dresses very handsomely, but always plain. No; what I was going to say is, that perhaps for a woman of her age—she is a little too fond of gentlemen\u0027s attention.\" \"Caroline told me that she was the most confirmed old maid she knew—an old maid who gloried in being an old maid.\" \"I don\u0027t know about that, my dear; but if a certain gentleman were to ask her, I don\u0027t think she\u0027d glory in it much longer. But she\u0027s a very nice person, and you\u0027ll like her very much.\" Miss Baker did go up to town, leaving Adela to Miss Todd\u0027s hospitality. She did go up, but in doing so resolved to return as soon as possible. Sir Lionel was now in the Paragon nearly every other day. To be sure, he did generally call in Montpellier Terrace on the alternate days. But then there was a reason for that. They had to talk about George and Caroline. What possible reason could there be for his going to the Paragon? Adela was rather frightened when she found herself left at Miss Todd\u0027s lodgings; though that lady\u0027s manner to her was not such as need have inspired much awe. \"Now, my dear,\" she said, \"don\u0027t mind me in the least. Do just whatever you like. If I only knew what you did like, you should have it if I could get it. What are you fond of now? Shall I ask some young people here to-night?\" \"Oh, no, Miss Todd; not for me. I have never been much in society, and certainly do not wish for it at present.\" \"Well, society is not a bad thing. You don\u0027t play cards, I suppose?\" \"I don\u0027t know one card from another.\" \"You\u0027d just suit Mr. O\u0027Callaghan then. Are you fond of young clergymen? There\u0027s one here might just suit you. All the young ladies are dying for him.\" \"Then pray don\u0027t let me interfere with them, Miss Todd.\" \"Perhaps you like officers better. There are heaps of them here. I don\u0027t know where they come from, and they never seem to have anything to do. The young ladies, however—those who don\u0027t run after Mr. O\u0027Callaghan—seem to think them very nice.\" \"Oh, Miss Todd, I don\u0027t want clergymen or officers.\" \"Don\u0027t you? Well then, we\u0027ll get some novels from the circulating library. At three o\u0027clock I always drive out, and we\u0027ll go to the pastrycook\u0027s. Oh, I declare, here\u0027s Sir Lionel Bertram, as usual. You know Sir Lionel, don\u0027t you?\" Adela said that she had met Sir Lionel at Miss Baker\u0027s. \"What a pity that match should have gone off, isn\u0027t it? I mean dear Miss Waddington. But though that match is off, another may come on. I for one should be very happy. You don\u0027t know anything about it, I see. I\u0027ll tell you some of these days. How do, Sir Lionel? You mustn\u0027t stay long, because Miss Gauntlet and I am going out. Or I\u0027ll tell you what. You shall take care of us. It\u0027s a beautiful day; and if Miss Gauntlet likes, we\u0027ll walk instead of having the fly.\" Miss Todd never aped grandeur, and always called her private carriage a fly, because it had only one horse. Sir Lionel, having made his salutations to Miss Gauntlet, declared that he should be most happy to be trusted with their custody through the streets of Littlebath. \"But we can\u0027t walk either, Miss Gauntlet, to-day, because I must call on old Mrs. Leake, at Rissbury. I quite forgot Mrs. Leake. So you see, Sir Lionel, we shan\u0027t want you after all.\" Sir Lionel declared that this last decision made him quite miserable. \"You\u0027ll be recovered by dinner-time, I don\u0027t doubt,\" said Miss Todd. \"And now I\u0027ll go upstairs and put my bonnet on. As Miss Gauntlet has got hers, you can stay and talk to her.\" \"Charming creature, Miss Todd; isn\u0027t she?\" said Sir Lionel, before the door was well closed. \"Such freshness of character, so much bonhommie—a little odd sometimes.\" These last words were not added till Miss Todd\u0027s footsteps, heavier than Camilla\u0027s, were heard well up the stairs. \"She seems to be a very good-natured person. I never saw her before to-day.\" \"Did you not? We knew her very intimately in the Holy Land\"—as if any land ever was or could be holy to Sir Lionel and such as he. \"That is, George and I, and Caroline. Of course, you know all about that Miss Waddington.\" Adela signified to him that she did know the circumstances to which he alluded. \"It is very sad, is it not? and then the connection between them being so near; and their being the joint-heirs to such an enormous property! I know the people here take Caroline\u0027s part, and say that she has been hardly used. But I cannot say that I blame George; I cannot, indeed.\" \"It is one of those cases in which no one should be blamed.\" \"Exactly—that is just what I say. My advice to George was this. Don\u0027t let money influence your conduct in any way. Thank God, there\u0027s enough of that for all of us! What you have to think of, is her happiness and your own. That\u0027s what I said; and I do believe he took my advice. I don\u0027t think he had any sordid views with reference to Caroline\u0027s fortune.\" \"I am sure he had not.\" \"Oh, no, never. What Sir Henry\u0027s views may be, I don\u0027t pretend to know. People here do say that he has been ingratiating himself with my brother for some time past. He has my leave, Miss Gauntlet. I am an old man, old enough to be your father\"—the well-preserved old beau might have said grandfather—\"and my experience of life is this, that money is never worth the trouble that men take to get it. They say my brother is fond of it; if so, I think he has made a mistake in life—a great mistake.\" All this sounded very nice, but even to Adela\u0027s inexperienced ears it was not like the ring of genuine silver. After all, mock virtue imposes on but few people. The man of the world is personally known for such; as also are known the cruel, the griping, the avaricious, the unjust. That which enables the avaricious and the unjust to pass scatheless through the world is not the ignorance of the world as to their sins, but the indifference of the world whether they be sinful or no. \"And now, Sir Lionel, you may just put us into the fly, and then we won\u0027t keep you any longer,\" said Miss Todd, as she re-entered the room with her bonnet and shawl. Mrs. Leake, who lived at Rissbury, was a deaf old lady, not very popular among other old ladies at Littlebath. All the world, of course, knows that the village of Rissbury is hardly more than a suburb of Littlebath, being distant from the High Street not above a mile and a half. It will be remembered that the second milestone on Hinchcombe Road is altogether beyond the village, just as you begin to ascend the hill near the turnpike. Mrs. Leake was not very popular, seeing that though her ear was excessively dull, her tongue was peculiarly acute. She had the repute of saying the most biting things of any lady in Littlebath—and many of the ladies of Littlebath were apt to say biting things. Then Mrs. Leake did not play cards, nor did she give suppers, nor add much in any way to the happiness of the other ladies, her compatriots. But she lived in rather a grand house of her own, whereas others lived in lodgings; she kept a carriage with a pair of horses, whereas others kept flies; and she had some mysterious acquaintance with the countyocracy which went a long way with the ladies of Littlebath; though what good it even did to Mrs. Leake herself was never very apparent. It is a terrible bore to have to talk to people who use speaking-trumpets, and who are so fidgety themselves that they won\u0027t use their speaking-trumpets properly. Miss Todd greatly dreaded the speaking-trumpet; she did not usually care one straw for Mrs. Leake\u0027s tongue, nor much for her carriage and horses, or county standing; but the Littlebath world called on Mrs. Leake; and Miss Todd being at Rome did as Romans do. \"I\u0027ll take her for five minutes,\" said Miss Todd, as, driving through the village of Rissbury, she finished her description of the lady; \"and then do you take her up for five more; and then I\u0027ll go on again; and then we\u0027ll go away.\" Adela agreed, though with a heavy heart; for what subject of conversation could she find on which to dilate to Mrs. Leake through a speaking-trumpet for five minutes? \"Miss who?\" said Mrs. Leake, putting her trumpet down from her ear that she might stare the better at Adela. \"Oh, Miss Gaunt—very well—I hope you\u0027ll like Littlebath, Miss Gaunt.\" \"Miss Gaunt-let!\" shouted Miss Todd, with a voice that would have broken the trumpet into shivers had it not been made of the very best metal. \"Never hollo, my dear. When you do that I can\u0027t hear at all. It only makes a noise like a dog barking. You\u0027ll find the young men about Littlebath very good-natured, Miss Gaunt. They are rather empty-headed—but I think young ladies generally like them all the better for that.\" Adela felt herself called on to make no answer to this, as it was not her turn at the trumpet. \"What news have you heard lately, Mrs. Leake?\" asked Miss Todd. The great thing was to make Mrs. Leake talk instead of having to talk to her. \"Amuse! No, I don\u0027t think they do amuse any one very much. But then that\u0027s not their line. I suppose they can dance, most of them; and those who\u0027ve got any money may do for husbands—as the world goes. We musn\u0027t be too particular; must we, Miss Gaunt?\" \"Miss Gaunt—let,\" whispered Miss Todd into the trumpet, separating the sounds well, so that they should not clash on the unsusceptible tympanum of her friend\u0027s ear. \"Let, let, let! I think I can hear anybody almost better than I can you, Miss Todd. I don\u0027t know how it is, but I never can hear the people out of the town as well as I can my own set. It\u0027s habit I take it.\" \"They\u0027re used to deaf people in the country, I suppose,\" said Miss Todd, who, with all her good nature, didn\u0027t choose to be over much put upon. \"Ah, I can\u0027t hear you,\" said Mrs. Leake. She had, however, heard this. \"But I want you to tell me something about this Caroline Waddington. Isn\u0027t it true she\u0027s got another lover already?\" \"Oh, quite true; she\u0027s going to be married.\" \"Wants to be married. Yes, I don\u0027t doubt she wants to be married. That\u0027s what they all want, only some are not able to manage it. Ha! ha! ha! I beg your pardon, Miss Gaunt; but we old women must have our joke about the young ones; mustn\u0027t we, Miss Todd?\" Mrs. Leake, be it noticed, was past seventy, whereas, our dear Miss Todd, was only just forty-four. \"Miss Gauntlet can tell you all about Miss Waddington,\" said Miss Todd, in her very plainest voice. \"They are very great friends, and correspond with each other.\" So Miss Todd handed over the spout of the trumpet. \"She was corresponding with another! I dare say she was; with half a dozen at once. Do you know anything about it, Miss Gaunt?\" Poor Adela! what was she to say or do. Her hand absolutely trembled as she put it lightly to the instrument. Thrice she bent her head down before she was able to say anything, and thrice she lifted it up in despair. \"Is it the lady or the gentleman that is a friend of yours, my dear? or which of the gentlemen? I hope she has not robbed you of a beau.\" \"Miss Waddington is a very dear friend of mine, ma\u0027am.\" \"Oh; she is, is she?\" \"And I know Mr. Bertram also.\" \"Is he a dear friend too? Well, I suppose he\u0027s disengaged now. But they tell me he\u0027s got nothing, eh?\" \"I really don\u0027t know.\" \"It\u0027s very hard to know; very. I don\u0027t much admire such jilts myself, but—\" \"Miss Waddington did not jilt him, madam.\" \"Then he jilted her. That\u0027s just what I want to come at. I\u0027m very much obliged to you, my dear. I see you can tell me all about it. It was about money, wasn\u0027t it?\" \"No,\" shouted Adela, with an energy that quite surprised herself. \"Money had nothing to do with it.\" \"I did not say you had anything to do with it. But don\u0027t take up that habit of holloing from Miss Todd. I suppose the truth was that he found out what he wasn\u0027t meant to find out. Men shouldn\u0027t be too inquisitive; should they, Miss Todd? You are quite right, Miss Gaunt, don\u0027t have anything to do with it; it\u0027s a bad affair.\" \"I think you are very much mistaken, madam,\" said Adela, again shouting. But it was all thrown away. \"I can\u0027t hear a word, when you hollo in that way, not a word,\" said Mrs. Leake. And then Adela, with an imploring look at Miss Todd, relinquished her seat. Miss Todd rose with the usual little speech about leave-taking. She had, as we have seen, intended to have gone in for a second innings herself, but all hope of winning the game against Mrs. Leake was over; even her courage was nearly upset; so making a little whisper to Adela, she held out her hand to the old lady, and prepared to depart. \"Dear me, you are in a great hurry to go,\" said Mrs. Leake. \"Yes; we are rather in a hurry this morning,\" said Miss Todd, neglectful of the trumpet, \"we have so many people to see.\" \"Well, good-bye; I\u0027m very much obliged to you for coming, and Miss Todd\"—and here Mrs. Leake affected to whisper; but her whisper would have been audible to a dozen, had a dozen been there—\"I mustn\u0027t forget to wish you joy about Sir Lionel. Good morning to you, Miss Gaunt,\" and then Mrs. Leake dropt an old-fashioned gracious curtsy. To say that Miss Todd blushed would be to belie the general rosiness of that lady\u0027s complexion. She was all blush always. Over her face colour of the highest was always flying. It was not only that her cheeks carried a settled brilliant tint, but at every smile—and Miss Todd was ever smiling—this tint would suffuse her forehead and her neck; at every peal of laughter—and her peals of laughter were innumerable—it would become brighter and brighter, coming and going, or rather ever coming fresh and never going, till the reflection from her countenance would illumine the whole room, and light up the faces of all around her. But now she almost blushed black. She had delighted hitherto in all the little bits of libellous tittle tattle to which her position as a young old maid had given rise, and had affected always to assist their propagation; but there was a poison about this old female snake, a sting in the tongue of this old adder which reached even her. \"The old fool!\" said Miss Todd, by no means sotto voce. Mrs. Leake heard her though the speaking trumpet was not in action. \"No, no, no,\" she said, in her most good-natured voice, \"I don\u0027t think he\u0027s such a fool at all. Of course he is old, and in want of an income, no doubt. But then he\u0027s a knight you know, my dear, and a colonel;\" and then the two ladies, waiting for no further courtesies, went back to their fly. Miss Todd had quite regained her good-humour by the time she was seated. \"Well,\" said she, \"what do you think of my friend, Mrs. Leake?\" \"What makes her so very spiteful?\" asked Adela. \"Why, you see, my dear, she\u0027d be nothing if she wasn\u0027t spiteful. It\u0027s her fate. She\u0027s very old, and she lives there by herself, and she doesn\u0027t go out much, and she has nothing to amuse her. If she didn\u0027t do that, she couldn\u0027t do anything. I rather like it myself.\" \"Well, I can\u0027t say I like it,\" said Adela; and then they sat silent for a time, Miss Todd the while reflecting whether she would, in any way, defend herself from that imputation about Sir Lionel. \"But you see what sort of a woman she is, Miss Gauntlet; and, of course, you must not believe a word that she says.\" \"How very dreadful!\" \"Oh; it does not mean anything. I call all those white lies. Nobody notices them. But what she said about Sir Lionel, you know—\" \"I really shall not think of anything she said.\" \"But I must explain to you,\" said Miss Todd, in whose mind, in spite of her blushing, a certain amount of pleasure was mixed with the displeasure which Mrs. Leake\u0027s scandal had caused her. For at this moment Sir Lionel was not a little thought of at Littlebath, and among the Lucretias there assembled, there was many a one who would have felt but small regret in abandoning her maiden meditations at the instance of Sir Lionel Bertram. \"But I must explain to you. Sir Lionel does come to see me very often; and I should think there was something in it—or, rather, I shouldn\u0027t be surprised at others thinking so—only that I am quite sure that he\u0027s thinking of somebody else.\" \"Is he?\" asked Adela, perhaps not with a great deal of animation. \"Yes; and I\u0027ll tell you who that somebody else is. Mind, I shouldn\u0027t say anything about it if I wasn\u0027t sure; that is almost sure; for one never can be quite sure about anything.\" \"Then I don\u0027t think one ought to talk about people.\" \"Oh, that\u0027s all very well. But then, at such a place as Littlebath, one would have to hold one\u0027s tongue altogether. I let people talk of me, and so I talk about them. One can\u0027t live without it, my dear. But I don\u0027t say things like Mrs. Leake.\" \"I\u0027m sure you don\u0027t.\" \"But now about Sir Lionel; can\u0027t you guess who it is?\" \"How should I, Miss Todd? I don\u0027t know a person in Littlebath except you and Miss Baker.\" \"There; now you have guessed it; I knew you would. Don\u0027t say I told you.\" \"Miss Baker marry Sir Lionel!\" \"Yes, Miss Baker marry Sir Lionel! and why not? Why shouldn\u0027t she? and why shouldn\u0027t he? I think it would be very wise. I think those sort of marriages often make people very happy.\" \"Do you think he loves her?\" said Adela, whose ideas of marriage were of very primitive description. \"Well, I don\u0027t see why he shouldn\u0027t; that is in a sort of a way. He won\u0027t write poetry about her eyebrows, if you mean that. But I think he\u0027d like her to keep his house for him; and now that Caroline is going away, I think she\u0027d like to have some one to live with. She\u0027s not born to be a solitary wild beast as I am.\" Adela was surprised, but she had nothing to say. She was aware of no reason which it suited her to allege why Miss Baker should not marry Sir Lionel Bertram. Had she been asked before, she would have said that Miss Baker seemed settled in her maiden life; and that she was but little likely to be moved by the civil speeches of an old military beau. But silence was perhaps the more prudent, and, therefore, she said nothing. Her fortnight with Miss Todd passed without much inconvenience to her. She had to sit out one or two card-parties; and to resist, at last with peremptory decision, her host\u0027s attempts to take her elsewhere. But Miss Todd was so truly kind, so generous, so fond of making others happy, that she won upon Adela at last, and they parted excellent friends. \"I am so fond of Miss Baker,\" Miss Todd said, on the last morning; \"and I do so truly hope she\u0027ll be happy; but don\u0027t you say a word about what I was saying. Only you watch if it isn\u0027t true. You\u0027ll see quite as much of Sir Lionel there as you have here:\" and so they parted, and Adela was transferred over to Montpellier Terrace. There had been some probability that Caroline would return to Littlebath with her aunt; but such was not the case. The autumn was advancing to its close. It was now November, and hardly a month remained before that—may we say happy day?—on which Miss Waddington was to become Lady Harcourt. There was, as Miss Baker said, so much to do, and so little time to do it! It had therefore been decided that Caroline should not return to Littlebath. \"And you have come back only on my account?\" said Adela. \"Not at all; I should have come back any way, for many reasons. I like to see Mr. Bertram from time to time, especially now that he has acknowledged Caroline; but it would kill me to stay long at that house. Did you see much of Sir Lionel while you were at Miss Todd\u0027s?\" \"Yes, a good deal,\" said Adela, who could hardly keep from smiling as she answered the question. \"He is always there, I believe. My idea is, that they mean to make a match of it. It is, indeed.\" \"Oh, no; I don\u0027t think that.\" \"Don\u0027t you now? Well, you have been in the house, and must have seen a great deal. But what else can bring him there so much?\" \"Miss Todd says he\u0027s always talking about you.\" \"About me; what nonsense!\" And Miss Baker went up to her room rather better pleased than she had been. Caroline, as will be remembered, had written to Adela with the tidings of her new engagement. Adela had answered that letter affectionately, but shortly; wishing her friend every happiness, and saying what little in the cheerful vein she could allow herself to say on such an occasion. The very shortness of her letter had conveyed condemnation, but that Adela could not help. Caroline had expected condemnation. She knew that she would be condemned, either by words or by the lack of them; it was nearly equal to her by which. Her mind was in that state, that having half condemned herself, she would have given anything for a cordial acquittal from one she loved and valued. But she did not expect it from Adela, and she did not receive it. She carried herself with a brave face, however. To her grandfather, to Miss Baker, and to her betrothed, she showed no sign of sorrow, no sign of repentance; but though there was, perhaps, no repentance in her heart, there was much sorrow and much remorse, and she could not keep herself wholly silent. She wrote again to Adela, almost imploring her for pity. We need not give the whole letter, but a portion of it will show how the poor girl\u0027s mind was at work. \"I know you have judged me, and found me guilty,\" she said. \"I can tell that from the tone of your letter, though you were generous enough to endeavour to deceive me. But you have condemned me because you do not know me. I feel sure that what I am doing, is prudent, and, I think I may say, right. Had I refused Sir Henry\u0027s offer, or some other such offer—and any offer to me would have been, and must have been open to the same objections—what should I have done? what would have been my career? I am not now speaking of happiness. But of what use could I have been to any one? \"You will say that I do not love Sir Henry. I have told him that in the usual acceptation of the word, I do not love him. But I esteem his high qualities; and I shall marry him with the full intention of doing my duty, of sacrificing myself to him if needs be, of being useful in the position in which he will place me. What better can I do than this? You can do better, Adela. I know you will do better. To have loved, and married for love the poorest gentleman on God\u0027s earth would be to have done better. But I cannot do that now. The power of doing that has been taken from me. The question with me was, whether I should be useful as a wife, or useless as an unmarried woman? For useless I should have been, and petulant, and wretched. Employment, work, duty, will now save me from that. Dear Adela, try to look at it in this way if it be possible. Do not throw me over without an attempt. Do not be unmerciful. * * * At any rate,\" she ended her letter by saying—\"At any rate you will come to me in London in the early, early spring. Say that you will do so, or I shall think that you mean to abandon me altogether!\" Adela answered this as sweetly and as delicately as she could. Natures, she said, were different, and it would be presumptuous in her to set herself up as judge on her friend\u0027s conduct. She would abstain from doing so, and would pray to God that Caroline and Sir Henry might be happy together. And as to going to London in the spring, she would do so if her aunt Penelope\u0027s plans would allow of it. She must of course be governed by her aunt Penelope, who was now hurrying home from Italy on purpose to give her a home. Nothing further occurred this year at Littlebath sufficiently memorable to need relation, unless it be necessary further to relate Miss Baker\u0027s nervous apprehensions respecting Sir Lionel. She was, in truth, so innocent that she would have revealed every day to her young friend the inmost secrets of her heart if she had had secrets. But, in truth, she had none. She was desperately jealous of Miss Todd, but she herself knew not why. She asked all manner of questions as to his going and coming, but she never asked herself why she was so anxious about it. She was in a twitter of sentimental restlessness, but she did not understand the cause of her own uneasiness. On the days that Sir Lionel came to her, she was happy, and in good spirits; when, however, he went to Miss Todd, she was fretful. Sometimes she would rally him on his admiration for her rival, but she did it with a bad grace. Wit, repartee, and sarcasm were by no means her forte. She could not have stood up for five minutes against deaf old Mrs. Leake; and when she tried her hand on Sir Lionel, her failure was piteous. It merely amounted to a gentle rebuke to him for going to the Paragon instead of coming to Montpellier Terrace. Adela saw it all, and saw also that Sir Lionel was in no way sincere. But what could she do, or what could she say? \"I hope Miss Todd was quite well yesterday, Sir Lionel?\" Miss Baker would say. \"I don\u0027t think there was much the matter with her,\" Sir Lionel would answer. \"She was talking a great deal about you while I was with her.\" \"About me; he! he! he! I\u0027m sure you had something better than me to talk of.\" \"There could be nothing better,\" the gallant colonel would say. \"Oh, couldn\u0027t there? and when is it to be? Adela here is most anxious to know.\" \"How can you say so, Miss Baker? You know I am not anxious at all.\" \"Well, if you\u0027re not, I am. I hope we shall be asked—ha! ha! ha!\" And why did not Sir Lionel make up his mind and put an end, in one way or the other, to the torment of this poor lady? Many reasons guided him in his high policy. In the first place, he could not make himself certain whether Miss Todd would accept him or refuse him. Her money was by far the safer; her fortune was assured; what she possessed, Sir Lionel already knew to a fraction. But Miss Baker, he was sure, would accept him; and having accepted him, would be amenable to all his little reasons in life, obedient, conformable, and, in money matters, manageable. Miss Todd, on the other hand, might, nay, certainly would have a will of her own. He would sooner have taken Miss Baker with half the money. But then would Miss Baker have half the money? If that stupid old man at Hadley would only go, and tell the only tale with which it was now possible that he should interest the world, then Sir Lionel would know how to act. At any rate, he would wait till after the solicitor-general\u0027s marriage. It might appear on that occasion whether or no Sir Henry was to be regarded as the old man\u0027s heir in all things. If so, Sir Lionel would be prepared to run all matrimonial risks, and present Miss Todd to the world as Lady Bertram.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2741/75485.html","bookId":1380,"book":{"id":1380,"title":"The Bertrams","description":"简介： This is undoubtedly the age of humanityas far, at least, as England is concerned.
