THE EFFECTS OF MISS TODD\u0027S PICNIC.","content":"Sir Lionel did not participate violently either in his son\u0027s disgust at the falsehood of that holy sepulchre church, nor in his enthusiasm as to the Mount of Olives. In the former, he walked about as he had done in many other foreign churches, looked a little to the right and a little to the left, observed that the roof seemed to be rather out of order, declined entering the sanctum sanctorum, and then asked whether there was anything more to be seen. He did not care, he said, about going upstairs into the gallery; and when George suggested that he should descend into the Armenian chapel, he observed that it appeared to be very dark and very crowded. He looked at the Turkish janitors without dismay, and could not at all understand why George should not approve of them. \\n\\n \\n\\n He was equally cold and equally complaisant on the Mount of Olives. He would willingly have avoided the ascent could he have done so without displeasing his son; but George made a point of it. A donkey was therefore got for him, and he rode up. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ah! yes,\" said he, \"a very clear view of the city; oh, that was Solomon\u0027s temple, was it? And now they have a mosque there, have they? Ah! perhaps the Brahmins will have a turn at it before the world is done. It\u0027s a barren sort of hill after all, is it not?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n And then George tried very much in vain to make his father understand why he wished to go into the church. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"By-the-by,\" said Sir Lionel—they were then sitting exactly on the spot where George had placed himself before, when he made that grand resolve to give up everything belonging to this world for the sake of being one of Christ\u0027s shepherds—\"by-the-by, George, for heaven\u0027s sake don\u0027t throw your uncle over in choosing a profession. I certainly should be sorry to see you become an attorney.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I have never thought of it for a moment,\" said George. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Because, with your abilities, and at any rate with your chance of money, I think you would be very much thrown away; but, considering his circumstances and yours, were I you, I would really submit almost to anything.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I will not at any rate submit to that,\" said George, not very well able to reconcile his father\u0027s tone to the spot on which they were sitting. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, it\u0027s your own affair, my boy. I have no right to interfere, and shall not attempt to do so; but of course I must be anxious. If you did go into the church, I suppose he\u0027d buy a living for you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Certainly not; I should take a college living.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"At your age any that you could get would be very small. Ah, George! if I could only put an old head upon young shoulders, what a hand of cards you would have to play! That old man could leave you half a million of money!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n This was certainly not the object with which the son had ascended the mount, and he did not use much eloquence to induce his father to remain long in the place. Sir Lionel got again on his donkey, and they returned to Jerusalem; nor did George ever again talk to him about the Mount of Olives. \\n\\n \\n\\n And he was not very much more successful with another friend into whose mind he endeavoured to inculcate his own high feelings. He got Miss Baker up to his favourite seat, and with her Miss Waddington; and then, before he had left Jerusalem, he succeeded in inducing the younger lady to ramble thither with him alone. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I do not know that I think so highly of the church as you do,\" said Caroline. \"As far as I have seen them, I cannot find that clergymen are more holy than other men; and yet surely they ought to be so.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"At any rate, there is more scope for holiness if a man have it in him to be holy. The heart of a clergyman is more likely to be softened than that of a barrister or an attorney.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t exactly know what you mean by heart-softening, Mr. Bertram.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I mean—\" said Bertram, and then he paused; he was not quite able, with the words at his command, to explain to this girl what it was that he did mean, nor was he sure that she would appreciate him if he did do so; and, fond as he still was of his idea of a holy life, perhaps at this moment he was fonder still of her. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I think that a man should do the best he can for himself in a profession. You have a noble position within your grasp, and if I were you, I certainly would not bury myself in a country parsonage.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n What this girl of twenty said to him had much more weight than the time-honoured precepts of his father; and yet both, doubtless, had their weight. Each blow told somewhat; and the seed too had been sown upon very stony ground. \\n\\n \\n\\n They sat there some three or four minutes in silence. Bertram was looking over to Mount Moriah, imaging to himself the spot where the tables of the money-changers had been overturned, while Miss Waddington was gazing at the setting sun. She had an eye to see material beauty, and a taste to love it; but it was not given to her to look back and feel those things as to which her lover would fain have spoken to her. The temple in which Jesus had taught was nothing to her. \\n\\n \\n\\n Yes, he was her lover now, though he had never spoken to her of love, had never acknowledged to himself that he did love her—as so few men ever do acknowledge till the words that they have said make it necessary that they should ask themselves whether those words are true. They sat there for some minutes in silence, but not as lovers sit. The distance between them was safe and respectful. Bertram was stretched upon the ground, with his eyes fixed, not upon her, but on the city opposite; and she sat demurely on a rock, shading herself with her parasol. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I suppose nothing would induce you to marry a clergyman?\" said he at last. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why should you suppose that, Mr. Bertram?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"At any rate, not the parson of a country parish. I am led to suppose it by what you said to me yourself just now.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I was speaking of you, and not of myself. I say that you have a noble career open to you, and I do not look on the ordinary life of a country parson as a noble career. For myself, I do not see any nobility in store. I do not know that there is any fate more probable for myself than that of becoming a respectable vicaress.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And why may not a vicar\u0027s career be noble? Is it not as noble to have to deal with the soul as with the body?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I judge by what I see. They are generally fond of eating, very cautious about their money, untidy in their own houses, and apt to go to sleep after dinner.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n George turned upon the grass, and for a moment or two ceased to look across into the city. He had not strength of character to laugh at her description and yet to be unmoved by it. He must either resent what she said, or laugh and be ruled by it. He must either tell her that she knew nothing of a clergyman\u0027s dearest hopes, or else he must yield to the contempt which her words implied. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And could you love, honour, and obey such a man as that, yourself, Miss Waddington?\" he said at last. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I suppose such men do have wives who love, honour, and obey them; either who do or do not. I dare say I should do much the same as others.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You speak of my future, Miss Waddington, as though it were a subject of interest; but you seem to think nothing of your own.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It is useless for a woman to think of her future; she can do so little towards planning it, or bringing about her plans. Besides, I have no right to count on myself as anything out of the ordinary run of women; I have taken no double-first degree in anything.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"A double-first is no sign of a true heart or true spirit. Many a man born to grovel has taken a double-first.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t perhaps know what you mean by grovelling, Mr. Bertram. I don\u0027t like grovellers myself. I like men who can keep their heads up—who, once having them above the water, will never allow them to sink. Some men in every age do win distinction and wealth and high place. These are not grovellers. If I were you I would be one of them.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You would not become a clergyman?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Certainly not; no more than I would be a shoemaker.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Miss Waddington!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well; and what of Miss Waddington? Look at the clergymen that you know; do they never grovel? You know Mr. Wilkinson; he is an excellent man, I am sure, but is he conspicuous for highmindedness, for truth and spirit?\" It must be remembered that the elder Mr. Wilkinson was at this time still living. \"Are they generally men of wide views and enlightened principles? I do not mean to liken them to shoemakers; but were I you, I should think of the one business as soon as the other.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And in my place, what profession would you choose?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ah, that I cannot say. I do not know your circumstances.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I must earn my bread, like other sons of Adam.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, earn it then in such manner that the eyes of the world shall be upon you; that men and women shall talk of you, and newspapers have your name in their columns. Whatever your profession, let it be a wakeful one; not one that you can follow half asleep.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Again he paused for awhile, and again sat looking at the rock of the temple. Still he thought of the tables of the money-changers, and the insufficiency of him who had given as much as half to the poor. But even while so thinking, he was tempted to give less than half himself, to set up on his own account a money-changing table in his own temple. He would fain have worshipped at the two shrines together had he been able. But he was not able; so he fell down before that of Mammon. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You can talk to me in this way, urge me to be ambitious, and yet confess that you could give yourself to one of those drones of whom you speak with such scorn.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I speak of no one with scorn; and I am not urging you; and at present am not talking of giving myself to any one. You ask as to the possibility of my ever marrying a clergyman; I say that it is very possible that I may do so some day.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Miss Waddington,\" said George; and now he had turned his face absolutely from the city, and was looking upwards to the hill; upwards, full into the beauty of her countenance. \"Miss Waddington!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, Mr. Bertram?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You speak of me as though I were a being high in the scale of humanity—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And so I think of you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Listen for a moment—and of yourself as one comparatively low.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No, no, not low; I have too much pride for that; much lower than you, certainly, for I have given no proofs of genius.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well—lower than me. That is what you have said, and I do not believe that you would say so falsely. You would not descend to flatter me?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Certainly not; but—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Believe equally of me that I would not flatter you. I have told you no falsehood as yet, and I have a right to claim your belief. As you look on me, so do I on you. I look up to you as one whose destiny must be high. To me there is that about you which forbids me to think that your path in the world can ever be other than conspicuous. Your husband, at least, will have to live before the world.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I shall not have the slightest objection to his doing so; but that, I think, will depend a great deal more on him than on me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Bertram was very anxious to say something which might tend towards the commingling of his destiny with hers. He was hardly yet prepared to swear that he loved her, and to ask her in good set terms to be his wife. But he did not like to leave her without learning whether he had at all touched her heart. He was fully sure now that his own was not whole. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Come, Mr. Bertram,\" said she; \"look at the sun, how nearly it is gone. And you know we have no twilight here. Let us go down; my aunt will think that we are lost.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"One minute, Miss Waddington; one minute, and then we will go. Miss Waddington—if you care enough for me to bid me take up any profession, follow any pursuit, I will obey you. You shall choose for me, if you will.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She blushed, not deeply, but with a colour sufficiently heightened to make it visible to him, and with a tingling warmth which made her conscious of it herself. She would have given much to keep her countenance, and yet the blush became her greatly. It took away from the premature firmness of her womanly look, and gave her for the moment something of the weakness natural to her age. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You know that is nonsense: on such a subject you must of course choose for yourself.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Bertram was standing in the path before her, and she could not well go on till he had made way for her. \"No,\" said he; \"thinking as I do of you, feeling as I do regarding you, it is not nonsense. It would be absolute nonsense if I said so to your aunt, or to Mrs. Hunter, or to Miss Jones. I could not be guided by a person who was indifferent to me. But in this matter I will be guided by you if you will consent to guide me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Of course I shall do no such thing.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You have no personal wish, then, for my welfare?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, I have. Your uncle is my guardian, and I may therefore be allowed to look upon you as a friend of a longer standing than merely of yesterday. I do regard you as a friend, and shall be glad of your success.\" Here she paused, and they walked on a few steps together in silence; and then she added, becoming still redder as she did so, but now managing to hide her face from her companion, \"Were I to answer you in the way that you pretend to wish, I should affect either less friendship than I feel, or much more.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Much more!\" said Bertram, with a shade of despondency in his tone. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, much more, Mr. Bertram. Why, what would you have me say?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ah me! I hardly know. Nothing—nothing—I would have you say nothing. You are quite right to say nothing.\" And then he walked on again for a hundred yards in silence. \"Nothing, Miss Waddington, nothing; unless, indeed—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mr. Bertram;\" and as she spoke she put out her hand and gently touched his arm. \"Mr. Bertram, stop yourself; think, at any rate, of what you are going to say. It is a pity when such as you speak foolishly.\" It was singular to see how much more composed she was than he; how much more able to manage the occasion—and yet her feelings were strong too. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Nothing; I would have you say nothing—nothing, unless this: that whatever my destiny may be, you will share it with me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n As he spoke he did not look towards her, but straight before him down the path. He did not sigh, nor look soft. There was indeed not much capability for soft looks in his square and strongly-featured face. He frowned rather, set his teeth together, and walked on faster than before. Caroline did not answer him immediately; and then he repeated his words. \"I do not care for you to say anything now, unless you can say this—that whatever your lot may be, I may share it; whatever mine, that you will share it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mr. Bertram.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Now you have spoken foolishly. Do you not know that you have spoken foolishly?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I have spoken truly. Do you speak as truly. You should be as much above false girlish petty scruples, as you will be and are above falsehood of another kind. You will never tell a man that you love him if you do not.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No; certainly, I never will.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"And do not deny it if it be the truth.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"But it is not the truth. How long have we known each other, Mr. Bertram?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Counting by days and hours, some fortnight. But what does that signify? You do not love a man the better always, the longer you know him. Of you, I discern that there is that in you I can love, that would make me happy. I have talent, some sort of talent at least. You have a spirit which would force me to use it. I will not pretend to say that I am suited for you. You must judge that. But I know that you are suited for me. Now I will take any answer you will give me.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n To tell the truth, Miss Waddington hardly knew what answer to give him. He was one, it seemed, who, having spoken with decision himself, would take any answer as decisive. He was one not to be tampered with, and one also hardly to be rejected without consideration; and certainly not so to be accepted. She had liked him much—very much, considering the little she had known of him. She had even asked herself, half playfully, whether it were not possible that she might learn to love him. He was a gentleman, and that with her was much. He was a man of talent, and that with her was more. He was one whose character and mode of thought she could respect. He was a man whom any woman might probably be able to respect. But Caroline Waddington wanted much more than this in her future lord. She could talk pleasantly of the probability of her marrying a country parson; but she had, in truth, a much wider ambition for herself. She would never marry—such was the creed which was to govern her own life—without love; but she would not allow herself to love where love would interfere with her high hopes. In her catalogue of human blisses love in a cottage was not entered. She was not avaricious; she did not look to money as the summum bonum;—certainly not to marry for money\u0027s sake. But she knew that no figure in the world could be made without means. Her own fortune was small, and she did not even rate her beauty high. Her birth was the birth of a lady, but that was all; her talents had never been tried, but she thought of them more indifferently than they deserved. She felt, therefore, that she had no just ground to hope for much; but she was determined that no folly on her own part should rob her of any chance that fortune might vouchsafe to her. \\n\\n \\n\\n Under such circumstances what answer should she make to Bertram? Her heart would have bid her not reject him, but she was fearful of her own heart. She dreaded lest she should be betrayed into sacrificing herself to love. Ought prudence now to step in and bid her dismiss a suitor whose youth had as yet achieved nothing, whose own means were very small, with whom, if he were accepted, her marriage must be postponed; who, however, was of great talent, who gave such promise of future distinction? Bertram, when he made his offer, made it from a full heart; but Caroline was able to turn these matters in her mind before she answered him. \\n\\n \\n\\n She will be called cold-hearted, mercenary, and unfeminine. But when a young girl throws prudence to the winds, and allows herself to love where there is nothing to live on, what then is she called? It seems to me that it is sometimes very hard for young girls to be in the right. They certainly should not be mercenary; they certainly should not marry paupers; they certainly should not allow themselves to become old maids. They should not encumber themselves with early, hopeless loves; nor should they callously resolve to care for nothing but a good income and a good house. There should be some handbook of love, to tell young ladies when they may give way to it without censure. As regards our heroine, however, she probably wanted no such handbook. \"Now I will take any answer you will give me.\" Bertram, when he had said that, remained silent, awaiting her reply. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Mr. Bertram,\" she said at last, \"I think that you have spoken unwisely; let us agree to forget it. What you have said has come from impulse rather than judgment.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not so, Miss Waddington. I cannot forget it; nor can you. I would not have it again unsaid if I could. When I once learned that I loved you, it became natural to me to tell you so.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Such quick speaking is not perhaps natural to me. But as you demand an immediate answer, I must give you one. I have had much pleasure in your society, but I have never thought of loving you. Nor can I love you without thinking of it.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n It would be hard to say what answer Bertram expected; indeed, he had no expectations. He had had no idea of making this offer when he walked up the hill with her. His heart was then turned rather to worship at that other shrine: it had been her own words, her own eloquence in favour of the world\u0027s greatness, that had drawn him on. He had previously filled his mind with no expectation; but he had felt an intense desire for success when once he had committed himself to his offer. \\n\\n \\n\\n And now, as he walked down beside her, he hardly knew what to make of her answer. A man, if he be not absolutely rejected, is generally inclined to think that any answer from a lady may be taken as having in it some glimmer of favour. And ladies know this so well, that they almost regard any reply on their own part, short of an absolute refusal, as an acceptance. If a lady bids a gentleman wait awhile for his answer, he thinks himself quite justified in letting all the world know that she is his own. We all know what a reference to a parent\u0027s judgment means. A lady must be very decisive—very, if she means to have her \"no\" taken at its full meaning. Now Caroline Waddington had not been very decisive. \\n\\n \\n\\n Whatever Bertram\u0027s thoughts or his hopes might be, he said nothing more on the present occasion. He walked silently down the hill by her side, somewhat moody-looking, but yet not with the hang-dog aspect of a rejected suitor. There was a fire in his eyes and a play upon his countenance which did not tell of hope altogether extinguished. Before they were at the foot of the hill, he had resolved that he would have Caroline Waddington for his wife, let the difficulties in his way be what they might. But then he was ever so keen to resolve; so often beaten from his resolutions! \\n\\n \\n\\n And Caroline also walked silently down the hill. She knew that she had given an ambiguous answer, and was content to let it remain so. In the silence of her chamber, she would think over this thing and make her calculations. She would inquire into her own mind, and learn whether she could afford to love this man whom she could not but acknowledge to be so loveable. As for asking any one else, seeking counsel in the matter from her aunt, that never for a moment suggested itself to Caroline Waddington. \\n\\n \\n\\n They had left Miss Baker and Miss Todd at the bottom of the hill. It was a beautiful evening, and those ladies had consented to sit down and rest there while the more enthusiastic and young lovers of the mount ascended to the spot of which Bertram was so fond. But in giving that consent, they had hardly expected that such encroachment would be made on their good-nature. When Caroline and Bertram again found them, the daylight had almost waned away. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2741/75466.html","bookId":1380,"book":{"id":1380,"title":"The Bertrams","description":"简介： This is undoubtedly the age of humanityas far, at least, as England is concerned.
