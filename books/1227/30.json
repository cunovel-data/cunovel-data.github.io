{"id":21228,"no":30,"title":"CHAPTER XXX. BENTON LAYS HIS PLANS.","content":"As Benton left the room, Paul Crambo, who was just coming upstairs, caught sight of him. Observing his landlord’s surprised look, Benton, who was not easily disconcerted, said, “I was looking for a clothes-brush. I thought Grant might have one in his room.” “Did you find one?” asked Crambo. “No.” “I thought he had one.” Paul Crambo entered the chamber, and pointed out a whisk-broom lying on the bureau. “There is one,” he said significantly. “So there is,” said Benton, for once looking confused. “Where could my eyes have been?” “It is strange you didn’t see it. It was in plain sight.” 257“So it was. I am very absent-minded.” Paul Crambo made no answer, but when he went downstairs he said to his wife, “I begin to mistrust that Benton.” “Why?” Then Paul told what he had seen. “You are right, Paul. He wasn’t in there for any good purpose. I can’t say I am very much surprised. I didn’t take any fancy to him.” “Nor I. I wouldn’t like to have him rob our two friends. They are fine fellows.” “We had better tell them to-night.” “I’ll do it before that. I’ll go out to their claim at once. The sooner they know it the better.” “Do so.” Paul Crambo didn’t often call on the two miners, and they were a little surprised to see him approaching the claim. “How are you, Mr. Crambo? Are you out for a walk?” asked Grant. “Partly; but partly on business.” “Do you want to buy us out?” “Well, not at present. I ain’t in love with 258gold-digging. Is that Benton a friend of yours, Mr. Colburn?” “He isn’t a friend. He is an acquaintance.” “Do you like him?” “Not overmuch.” “You had better look out for him.” “What do you mean?” asked Grant quickly. “I don’t think he’s honest.” “You have some reason for saying that, Mr. Crambo,” said Tom Cooper. “Just before I left the house I saw him coming out of your room.” “Did he see you?” “Yes.” “What did he say?” “He made a blind excuse; said he went in there for a clothes-brush, but he couldn’t find one.” “Why, there was one on the bureau.” “So I found out when I went into the room. I called his attention to it, and asked how it happened that he didn’t see it.” “Well?” “He said he was very absent-minded. I 259think he didn’t visit the room for any good purpose.” “I am sure of it,” said Grant, and then he told of Benton’s experience in Sacramento. “If you have anything of value in your chamber,” continued Paul, “I think you had better remove it, or make sure that it can’t be taken away by your old friend.” “The fact is, Mr. Crambo,” said Tom Cooper, “we have considerable dust in the chest which we bought of you. We have kept it secret hitherto, but I know I can rely upon you, and I want your advice as to what to do. You don’t think Benton opened the chest?” “No; he didn’t have time. Besides, he had nothing with him.” “It won’t be safe to keep it there any longer; but the problem is, what shall we do with it? We can’t find a hiding-place for it here.” “If you will see Mrs. Crambo about it, I think that she has a trunk that you can use for the purpose.” “But wouldn’t that be just as risky?” “Not if the trunk is kept in our chamber. 260Of course that depends on whether you have any confidence in us.” “The strongest, Mr. Crambo,” said Tom cordially. “The plan seems a good one. But the transfer must be made when Benton is out of the way.” “We must pick out the right time. To-night you can consult with Mrs. C. Then if Mr. Benton carries out his plan, and opens the chest, no harm will be done.” “I hope he will,” said Tom. “I should like to watch the fellow’s face, and see how disappointed he will look.” When Tom and Grant met Benton in the evening, it was difficult for them to treat him as usual. Tom had a strong desire, as he afterward told Grant, to seize Benton and shake the life out of him. “Did you have a good day, gentlemen?” asked Benton nonchalantly. “Oh, so, so! We didn’t come across a bonanza.” “I have, but I can’t avail myself of it.” “You refer to the restaurant?” “Yes; I am afraid it will slip out of my 261hands if I don’t raise five hundred dollars within a week.” “Have you any scheme for raising it?” asked Tom Cooper. “Well, no, not exactly. I hope to find some one who will lend me the money. If you and Grant, now——” “We need the little money we have for other purposes,” interrupted Cooper. “Oh, that’s all right. I guess I’ll raise it somewhere.” “I suppose he means in our chest,” thought Grant.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1644/48607.html","bookId":1227,"book":{"id":1227,"title":"Digging for Gold","description":"简介： His mother looked up from the table where she was cutting out pie crust, and asked in surprise, What do you mean, Grant?
