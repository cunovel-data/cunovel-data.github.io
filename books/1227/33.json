ON TO THE GOLDEN GATE.","content":"“Then you have really prospered?” said Mr. Gilbert. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Yes, sir; we must have as much as seven hundred dollars more, but this was as much as Grant could conveniently carry. We depend on his shabby attire to save him from attracting the attention of robbers.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “You will remain at the claim?” said Mr. Gilbert, addressing himself to Tom. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Yes, I shall continue to work it. Grant is summoned to San Francisco by a friend whose acquaintance he made in crossing the plains.” \\n\\n \\n\\n They stopped an hour to chat with the old man, and then, resuming their march, reached Howe’s Gulch in time for supper. \\n\\n \\n\\n They were immediately surrounded by old acquaintances. \\n\\n \\n\\n 278“Where are you bound, Tom?” asked one. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Grant is going to San Francisco. He has an offer of employment from a rich man there.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Won’t you join us again?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “No; I have a claim some way from here which will bear working a little longer.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “The boy doesn’t look as if you had struck luck.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “He will be all right when he reaches San Francisco.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “How about yourself?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Oh, well, I am not discouraged. There are better times in store.” \\n\\n \\n\\n One of the crowd was Nahum Stockton, to whom Grant and Tom had given their claims when they left Howe’s Gulch. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Look here, Cooper,” he said. “You did me a good turn. I’ve done pretty well with the claim you gave me, and I want to show my gratitude. If fifty dollars will do you or the boy any good, I will let you have it.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Tom Cooper wrung his hand cordially. \\n\\n \\n\\n “You’re a good fellow, Stockton,” he said, “but we are not in want. I am glad you have done fairly well, but we don’t stand in need of 279help at present. If we ever do, we won’t forget your kind offer.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “That’s right. You shall be heartily welcome to anything I have.” \\n\\n \\n\\n The two partners went to the hotel and stayed overnight. They were pleased to think that no one suspected them of having been fortunate. There were some friends—Nahum Stockton, for instance—to whom they would have been willing to communicate it, but they considered it advisable, on the whole, to keep the matter a profound secret. \\n\\n \\n\\n The next morning Grant took the stage for Sacramento, and arrived there without any exciting adventure. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Go and see father and mother, Grant,” said Tom. “Don’t tell them too much, but let them know that I am making a living, and have no cause to complain.” \\n\\n \\n\\n Mr. Cooper had just finished shoeing a horse, when Grant walked up to the shop. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Why, Grant Colburn!” exclaimed the blacksmith, “it’s good to see you. But—” and here he surveyed Grant’s attire—“you look kind of seedy, don’t you?” \\n\\n \\n\\n 280“Yes,” laughed Grant; “but there are no good tailors’ shops where I have been working.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Have you come to Sacramento to work?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “No. I am bound for San Francisco. Mr. Crosmont has sent for me.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “How did you leave Tom?” asked Mrs. Cooper, who had entered the shop, as she shook hands with Grant. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Well and hearty, Mrs. Cooper.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Why didn’t he come with you?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Mr. Crosmont didn’t send for him.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “How is he doing?” \\n\\n \\n\\n “Well, he isn’t exactly a millionnaire yet,” answered Grant, with a laugh. \\n\\n \\n\\n “I’m afraid not, if we’re to judge by appearances,” and Mr. Cooper shook his head, as he bestowed another glance on Grant’s outfit. “He’d much better give up this notion of gold-digging and come back here in the shop with me.” \\n\\n \\n\\n “But at mining you may strike it rich any day, you know,” returned Grant cheerfully. “Tom has really reason to feel encouraged, and may surprise you by making his fortune yet.” \\n\\n \\n\\n 281“Those aint the kind of surprises that grow on every bush,” and Mr. Cooper once more sagely shook his head. \\n\\n \\n\\n After accepting of the hospitality of the kindly blacksmith and his wife, Grant proceeded on his journey. \\n\\n \\n\\n He was lucky enough to secure the only remaining seat in the next coach for San Francisco, and was soon started on the last stage of his progress toward the Golden Gate. Of his fellow passengers two were miners, two farmers, one a school-teacher, another a boy of about Grant’s age, and the seventh a black-eyed gentleman, who listened attentively to all that was said, but made very few remarks himself. \\n\\n \\n\\n Grant was glad to find his place next to the youngest member of the party, who gave his name as Robert Campbell, and stated that he had been on a visit to a relative in Sacramento. \\n\\n \\n\\n “I trust we don’t fall in with the road agents,” remarked one of the miners, soon after they had got under way. \\n\\n \\n\\n “Why, do you think there is any danger of it?” inquired the school-teacher anxiously. \\n\\n \\n\\n 282“Well, that’s one of the things we may expect on such a trip as we are taking,” returned the miner, adding: “I’d much prefer they wouldn’t make me hold up my hands this time, however.” \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1644/48610.html","bookId":1227,"book":{"id":1227,"title":"Digging for Gold","description":"简介： His mother looked up from the table where she was cutting out pie crust, and asked in surprise, What do you mean, Grant?
