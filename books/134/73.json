The first was the appeal to the Senate in Maslova\u0027s case; the second, to hand in Theodosia Birukoff\u0027s petition to the committee; the third, to comply with Vera Doukhova\u0027s requests--i.e., try to get her friend Shoustova released from prison, and get permission for a mother to visit her son in prison. Vera Doukhova had written to him about this, and he was going to the Gendarmerie Office to attend to these two matters, which he counted as one.\\n\\n The fourth matter he meant to attend to was the case of some sectarians who had been separated from their families and exiled to the Caucasus because they read and discussed the Gospels. It was not so much to them as to himself he had promised to do all he could to clear up this affair.\\n\\n Since his last visit to Maslennikoff, and especially since he had been in the country, Nekhludoff had not exactly formed a resolution but felt with his whole nature a loathing for that society in which he had lived till then, that society which so carefully hides the sufferings of millions in order to assure ease and pleasure to a small number of people, that the people belonging to this society do not and cannot see these sufferings, nor the cruelty and wickedness of their life. Nekhludoff could no longer move in this society without feeling ill at ease and reproaching himself. And yet all the ties of relationship and friendship, and his own habits, were drawing him back into this society. Besides, that which alone interested him now, his desire to help Maslova and the other sufferers, made it necessary to ask for help and service from persons belonging to that society, persons whom he not only could not respect, but who often aroused in him indignation and a feeling of contempt.\\n\\n When he came to Petersburg and stopped at his aunt\u0027s--his mother\u0027s sister, the Countess Tcharsky, wife of a former minister--Nekhludoff at once found himself in the very midst of that aristocratic circle which had grown so foreign to him. This was very unpleasant, but there was no possibility of getting out of it. To put up at an hotel instead of at his aunt\u0027s house would have been to offend his aunt, and, besides, his aunt had important connections and might be extremely useful in all these matters he meant to attend to.\\n\\n \"What is this I hear about you? All sorts of marvels,\" said the Countess Katerina Ivanovna Tcharsky, as she gave him his coffee immediately after his arrival. \"_Vous posez pour un Howard_. Helping criminals, going the round of prisons, setting things right.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, no. I never thought of it.\"\\n\\n \"Why not? It is a good thing, only there seems to be some romantic story connected with it. Let us hear all about it.\"\\n\\n Nekhludoff told her the whole truth about his relations to Maslova.\\n\\n \"Yes, yes, I remember your poor mother telling me about it. That was when you were staying with those old women. I believe they wished to marry you to their ward (the Countess Katerina Ivanovna had always despised Nekhludoff\u0027s aunts on his father\u0027s side). So it\u0027s she. _Elle est encore jolie?_\"\\n\\n Katerina Ivanovna was a strong, bright, energetic, talkative woman of 60. She was tall and very stout, and had a decided black moustache on her lip. Nekhludoff was fond of her and had even as a child been infected by her energy and mirth.\\n\\n \"No, ma tante, that\u0027s at an end. I only wish to help her, because she is innocently accused. I am the cause of it and the cause of her fate being what it is. I feel it my duty to do all I can for her.\"\\n\\n \"But what is this I have heard about your intention of marrying her?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, it was my intention, but she does not wish it.\"\\n\\n Katerina Ivanovna looked at her nephew with raised brows and drooping eyeballs, in silent amazement. Suddenly her face changed, and with a look of pleasure she said: \"Well, she is wiser than you. Dear me, you are a fool. And you would have married her?\"\\n\\n \"Most certainly.\"\\n\\n \"After her having been what she was?\"\\n\\n \"All the more, since I was the cause of it.\"\\n\\n \"Well, you are a simpleton,\" said his aunt, repressing a smile, \"a terrible simpleton; but it is just because you are such a terrible simpleton that I love you.\" She repeated the word, evidently liking it, as it seemed to correctly convey to her mind the idea of her nephew\u0027s moral state. \"Do you know--What a lucky chance. Aline has a wonderful home--the Magdalene Home. I went there once. They are terribly disgusting. After that I had to pray continually. But Aline is devoted to it, body and soul, so we shall place her there--yours, I mean.\"\\n\\n \"But she is condemned to Siberia. I have come on purpose to appeal about it. This is one of my requests to you.\"\\n\\n \"Dear me, and where do you appeal to in this case?\"\\n\\n \"To the Senate.\"\\n\\n \"Ah, the Senate! Yes, my dear Cousin Leo is in the Senate, but he is in the heraldry department, and I don\u0027t know any of the real ones. They are all some kind of Germans--Gay, Fay, Day--tout l\u0027alphabet, or else all sorts of Ivanoffs, Simenoffs, Nikitines, or else Ivanenkos, Simonenkos, Nikitenkos, pour varier. Des gens de l\u0027autre monde. Well, it is all the same. I\u0027ll tell my husband, he knows them. He knows all sorts of people. I\u0027ll tell him, but you will have to explain, he never understands me. Whatever I may say, he always maintains he does not understand it. C\u0027est un parti pris, every one understands but only not he.\"\\n\\n At this moment a footman with stockinged legs came in with a note on a silver platter.\\n\\n \"There now, from Aline herself. You\u0027ll have a chance of hearing Kiesewetter.\"\\n\\n \"Who is Kiesewetter?\"\\n\\n \"Kiesewetter? Come this evening, and you will find out who he is. He speaks in such a way that the most hardened criminals sink on their knees and weep and repent.\"\\n\\n The Countess Katerina Ivanovna, however strange it may seem, and however little it seemed in keeping with the rest of her character, was a staunch adherent to that teaching which holds that the essence of Christianity lies in the belief in redemption. She went to meetings where this teaching, then in fashion, was being preached, and assembled the \"faithful\" in her own house. Though this teaching repudiated all ceremonies, icons, and sacraments, Katerina Ivanovna had icons in every room, and one on the wall above her bed, and she kept all that the Church prescribed without noticing any contradiction in that.\\n\\n \"There now; if your Magdalene could hear him she would be converted,\" said the Countess. \"Do stay at home to-night; you will hear him. He is a wonderful man.\"\\n\\n \"It does not interest me, ma tante.\"\\n\\n \"But I tell you that it is interesting, and you must come home. Now you may go. What else do you want of me? _Videz votre sac_.\"\\n\\n \"The next is in the fortress.\"\\n\\n \"In the fortress? I can give you a note for that to the Baron Kriegsmuth. _Cest un tres brave homme_. Oh, but you know him; he was a comrade of your father\u0027s. _Il donne dans le spiritisme_. But that does not matter, he is a good fellow. What do you want there?\"\\n\\n \"I want to get leave for a mother to visit her son who is imprisoned there. But I was told that this did not depend on Kriegsmuth but on Tcherviansky.\"\\n\\n \"I do not like Tcherviansky, but he is Mariette\u0027s husband; we might ask her. She will do it for me. _Elle est tres gentille_.\"\\n\\n \"I have also to petition for a woman who is imprisoned there without knowing what for.\"\\n\\n \"No fear; she knows well enough. They all know it very well, and it serves them right, those short-haired [many advanced women wear their hair short, like men] ones.\"\\n\\n \"We do not know whether it serves them right or not. But they suffer. You are a Christian and believe in the Gospel teaching and yet you are so pitiless.\"\\n\\n \"That has nothing to do with it. The Gospels are the Gospels, but what is disgusting remains disgusting. It would be worse if I pretended to love Nihilists, especially short-haired women Nihilists, when I cannot bear them.\"\\n\\n \"Why can you not bear them?\"\\n\\n \"You ask why, after the 1st of March?\" [The Emperor Alexander II was killed on the first of March, old style.]\\n\\n \"They did not all take part in it on the 1st of March.\"\\n\\n \"Never mind; they should not meddle with what is no business of theirs. It\u0027s not women\u0027s business.\"\\n\\n \"Yet you consider that Mariette may take part in business.\"\\n\\n \"Mariette? Mariette is Mariette, and these are goodness knows what. Want to teach everybody.\"\\n\\n \"Not to teach but simply to help the people.\"\\n\\n \"One knows whom to help and whom not to help without them.\"\\n\\n \"But the peasants are in great need. I have just returned from the country. Is it necessary, that the peasants should work to the very limits of their strength and never have sufficient to eat while we are living in the greatest luxury?\" said Nekhludoff, involuntarily led on by his aunt\u0027s good nature into telling her what he was in his thoughts.\\n\\n \"What do you want, then? That I should work and not eat anything?\"\\n\\n \"No, I do not wish you not to eat. I only wish that we should all work and all eat.\" He could not help smiling as he said it.\\n\\n Again raising her brow and drooping her eyeballs his aunt look at him curiously. \"_Mon cher vous finirez mal_,\" she said.\\n\\n Just then the general, and former minister, Countess Tcharsky\u0027s husband, a tall, broad-shouldered man, came into the room.\\n\\n \"Ah, Dmitri, how d\u0027you do?\" he said, turning his freshly-shaved cheek to Nekhludoff to be kissed. \"When did you get here?\" And he silently kissed his wife on the forehead.\\n\\n \"_Non il est impayable_,\" the Countess said, turning to her husband. \"He wants me to go and wash clothes and live on potatoes. He is an awful fool, but all the same do what he is going to ask of you. A terrible simpleton,\" she added. \"Have you heard? Kamenskaya is in such despair that they fear for her life,\" she said to her husband. \"You should go and call there.\"\\n\\n \"Yes; it is dreadful,\" said her husband.\\n\\n \"Go along, then, and talk to him. I must write some letters.\"\\n\\n Hardly had Nekhludoff stepped into the room next the drawing-room than she called him back.\\n\\n \"Shall I write to Mariette, then?\"\\n\\n \"Please, ma tante.\"\\n\\n \"I shall leave a blank for what you want to say about the short-haired one, and she will give her husband his orders, and he\u0027ll do it. Do not think me wicked; they are all so disgusting, your prologues, but _je ne leur veux pas de mal_, bother them. Well, go, but be sure to stay at home this evening to hear Kiesewetter, and we shall have some prayers. And if only you do not resist _cela vous fera beaucoup de bien_. I know your poor mother and all of you were always very backward in these things.\"\\n\\n 聂赫留朵夫在彼得堡有三件事要办：向枢密院提出上诉，要求重新审查玛丝洛娃案；把费多霞的案子提交上告委员会；受薇拉之托到宪兵司令部或者第三厅去要求释放舒斯托娃，并让一个做母亲的同关在要塞里的儿子见面。为了这事薇拉给他写过信。这两件事他并在一起，算作第三件。再有就是教派信徒的案子，他们因为诵读和讲解福音书而被迫离开家人，流放高加索。他与其说是答应他们，不如说是自己下定决心，一定要使这个案子真相大白。\\n\\n 聂赫留朵夫自从上次访问玛斯连尼科夫，特别是回乡一次以后，他不是随便断定，而是全身心感觉到，他憎恶他生活在其中的那个圈子，憎恶那个为了确保少数人享福而迫使千万人受苦并且竭力加以掩盖的圈子。那个圈子里的人没有看到，也看不到他们的苦难，因此也看不到自己生活的残酷和罪恶。聂赫留朵夫现在同那个圈子里的人交往，不能不觉得嫌恶，不能不责备自己。不过，长期的生活习惯又把他吸引到那个圈子里去，他的亲友也吸引着他。而主要是因为要办理他现在唯一关心的事——帮助玛丝洛娃和他愿意帮助的其他一切受难者，他不得不求助于那个圈子里的人，尽管那些人不仅无法使他尊敬，而且常常使他愤慨和蔑视。\\n\\n 聂赫留朵夫来到彼得堡，住在姨妈察尔斯基伯爵夫人家里。他的姨父做过大臣。他一到姨妈家，就落到同他格格不入的贵族社会的核心里。这使他很反感，但又无可奈何。要是不住姨妈家而住旅馆，那就会得罪姨妈。而他知道姨妈交游广阔，对他要奔走的各种事可能极有帮助。\\n\\n “啊，关于你，我听到些什么事啦？真是太奇怪了，”姨妈等他一到立刻请他喝咖啡，这样对他说。“你简直是霍华德①！你帮助罪犯，视察监狱，平反冤狱。”\\n\\n “不，我连想都没有想过这样做。”\\n\\n “那很好。不过，这里面好象还有什么风流韵事吧。嗯，你倒说说！”\\n\\n 聂赫留朵夫把他同玛丝洛娃的关系从头到尾讲了一遍。\\n\\n “我记得，记得，可怜的爱伦②对我说起过，当年你住在那两个老太婆家里，她们好象要你同她们的养女结婚，”察尔斯基伯爵夫人一向瞧不起聂赫留朵夫的两位姑妈。“……原来就是她吗？她现在还漂亮吗？”\\n\\n --------\\n\\n ①约翰·霍华德（1726—1790）——英国慈善家，为改良监狱制度进行过活动。\\n\\n ②指聂赫留朵夫的母亲。\\n\\n 这位姨妈今年六十岁，身体健康，精力充沛，兴致勃勃，谈锋很健。她的身材又高又胖，唇上有黑色汗毛。聂赫留朵夫喜欢她，从小就受她生气蓬勃和快活开朗的性格的影响。\\n\\n “不，姨妈，那件事已经结束了。我现在只想帮助她，因为第一她被冤枉判了刑，我有责任，再说她这辈子弄到如此地步，我更是罪责难逃。我觉得我应该尽一切力量替她奔走。”\\n\\n “可我怎么听人说你要同她结婚呢？”\\n\\n “是的，我有过这样的想法，可是她不愿意。”\\n\\n 察尔斯基伯爵夫人扬起眉毛，垂下眼珠，惊讶地默默瞧了瞧外甥。她的脸色顿时变了，现出高兴的样子。\\n\\n “嗯，她比你聪明。嘿，你可真是个傻瓜！你真的想同她结婚吗？”\\n\\n “当然。”\\n\\n “她干过那种营生，你还愿意同她结婚吗？”\\n\\n “更加愿意了。因为我是罪魁祸首。”\\n\\n “哼，你简直是个蠢货，”姨妈忍住笑说。“十足的蠢货，但我就喜欢你这种十足的蠢货，”她反复说，特别喜欢“蠢货”这个名词，因为她认为这个名词确切地表明了外甥的智力和精神状态。“说来也真凑巧，”她说下去。“阿林办了个出色的抹大拉①收容所。我去过一次。她们真叫人恶心。我回来从头到脚都好好地洗了一遍。不过阿林办这事是全心全意的。我们就把她，你那个女人，交给她吧。要叫她们这批人改恶从善，再没有比阿林更有办法了。”\\n\\n --------\\n\\n ①原指《新约全书·路加福音》中从良的妓女。\\n\\n “不过她被判服苦役了。我就是来替她奔走，要求撤销这个判决的。这是我来求您的第一件事。”\\n\\n “原来如此！那么她的案子归哪里管呢？”\\n\\n “枢密院。”\\n\\n “枢密院吗？对了，我那个亲爱的表弟廖伏什卡就在枢密院。不过他是在那儿的傻瓜部里办事，当承宣官。至于真正的枢密官我可一个也不认识。天知道他们是些什么人：要不是德国人，什么盖啦，费啦，德啦，无奇不有，就是什么伊凡诺夫啦，谢苗诺夫啦，尼基丁啦，再不然就是什么伊凡宁科啦，西蒙宁科啦，尼基丁科啦，五花八门，都是另一个世界的人。好吧，反正我对丈夫说一下就是了。他认识他们。他什么人都认识。我会对他说的。但你自己得对他说个清楚，我的话他总是听不懂。不管我说什么，他总是说什么也不明白。\\n\\n 他这是存心装不懂。人家个个听得懂，就是他听不懂。”\\n\\n 这时，一个穿长统袜的男仆端来一个银托盘，上面放着一封信。\\n\\n “正好是阿林写来的信。这下子你就可以听见基泽维特的讲话了。”\\n\\n “基泽维特是什么人？”\\n\\n “基泽维特吗？你今天晚上来吧。你就会知道他是个什么人了。他讲得那么动人，就连死不改悔的罪犯听了也会跪下来，痛哭流涕，诚心忏悔。”\\n\\n 不论这事有多怪，也不论这事同察尔斯基伯爵夫人的脾气多么格格不入，她却狂热地信奉基督教的精神在于赎罪那种学说。她常到宣传这种学说的聚会场所，有时还把信徒召集到家里。这种风行一时的学说不仅否定一切宗教仪式和圣像，而且否定圣礼，但察尔斯基伯爵夫人却在每个房间里挂着圣像，甚至连床头上都有圣像，她还参与一切教会仪式，并不认为这同赎罪说有什么矛盾。\\n\\n “对了，应该让你的抹大拉听听他的讲道，她会皈依的，”伯爵夫人说。“你今天晚上一定要待在家里。你听听他的讲道。\\n\\n 这是一个了不起的人物。”\\n\\n “我对这种事不感兴趣，姨妈。”\\n\\n “我告诉你，这很有趣。你一定要来。那么，你倒说说，你还有什么事要我办？全说出来吧！”\\n\\n “还有，在要塞那边也有一件事。”\\n\\n “在要塞那边？好，我可以给你写一封信，你到那边去找克里斯穆特男爵。他这人人品极好。你自己会知道的。他是你父亲的同事。他就是对关亡着了迷。不过，这也没关系。他这人心地挺好。你在那边有什么事？”\\n\\n “我要求他们准许一个做母亲的同关在那边的儿子见一次面。不过我听说这种事不归克里斯穆特管，它归切尔维扬斯基管。”\\n\\n “切尔维扬斯基这人我可不喜欢，但他是玛丽爱特的丈夫。可以托托她，她肯为我出力的。她挺可爱。”\\n\\n “我再要为另一个女人求情。她坐了几个月牢，可是谁也不知道为了什么。”\\n\\n “不会的，她自己一定知道为了什么。她们清楚得很。她们都是罪有应得，这批剃光头的家伙。”\\n\\n “我们不知道是不是罪有应得。可是她们在受罪。您是位基督徒，相信福音书，可是心肠这么硬……”\\n\\n “这可不相干。福音书是福音书，讨厌的就是讨厌的。臂如说，我恨虚无党，特别是那些剪短头发的女虚无党，要是我假装喜欢她们，那就不好了。”\\n\\n “您到底为什么恨她们呢？”\\n\\n “在出了三月一日事件①以后，你还要问为什么吗？”\\n\\n --------\\n\\n ①指一八八一年三月一日沙皇亚历山大二世被民意党人暗杀一事。\\n\\n “那些女人又不是个个都参加三月一日事件的。”\\n\\n “还不是一样，她们为什么要管闲事？那又不是女人家的事。”\\n\\n “那么，为什么您认为玛丽爱特就可以过问那种事呢？”聂赫留朵夫说。\\n\\n “玛丽爱特吗？玛丽爱特是玛丽爱特。可是天知道她是什么路数。一个轻薄的女人倒想教训起大家来了。”\\n\\n “不是教训人，只是想帮助老百姓。”\\n\\n “没有她们，人家也知道谁该帮助，谁不该帮助。”\\n\\n “不过，您要知道，老百姓穷得很。喏，我刚从乡下回来。农民干活干得死去活来，还吃不饱肚子，我们却过着穷奢极侈的生活。这难道合理吗？”聂赫留朵夫不由得受他姨妈善心的影响，把心里话都说了出来。\\n\\n “那你是不是要我也去做工而不吃饭呢？”\\n\\n “不，我不是要您不吃饭，”聂赫留朵夫回答，不由得笑了，“我只是要人人工作，个个有饭吃。”\\n\\n 姨妈又拧紧眉头，垂下眼珠，好奇地瞧着他。\\n\\n “我的好外甥，你不会有好下场的，”她说。\\n\\n “那是为什么呀？”\\n\\n 这时候，一个身材很高、肩膀宽阔的将军走进房间里来。\\n\\n 这就是察尔斯基伯爵夫人的丈夫，一位退休的大臣。\\n\\n “啊，德米特里，你好，”他说，凑过刮得光光的脸颊让聂赫留朵夫亲吻。“你几时来的？”\\n\\n 他默默地吻了吻妻子的前额。\\n\\n “哦，他这个人真是少见，”察尔斯基伯爵夫人对丈夫说。\\n\\n “他叫我到河边去洗衣服，光吃土豆过日子。他是个十足的傻瓜，不过他求你的事，你还是帮他办一下吧。他是个十足的蠢货，”她又说。“你有没有听到，据说卡敏斯卡雅伤心得不得了，大家怕她的命会保不住，”她对丈夫说，“你最好去看她一下。”\\n\\n “是吗，这太可怕了，”做丈夫的说。\\n\\n “好，你去同他谈谈，我要写信了。”\\n\\n 聂赫留朵夫刚走到客厅旁边那个房间里，她就对他叫道：\\n\\n “那么要给玛丽爱特写封信吗？”\\n\\n “麻烦您了，姨妈。”\\n\\n “那么我就在信纸上留一块空白，你自己把那个短头发女人的事写上去，玛丽爱特会叫她丈夫去办的。他一定会办的。你别以为我这人心眼儿坏。她们，就是那批受你保护的人，都很可恶，但我并不希望她们遭殃。上帝保佑她们！你去吧。不过今天晚上你一定要待在家里。你可以听听基泽维特的讲道。我们一块儿做祷告。只要你不反对，这对你是大有好处的。我知道，爱伦也好，你也好，在这方面都很落后。那么再见了。”\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/328/3248.html","bookId":134,"book":{"id":134,"title":"复活 Resurrection","description":"简介： 列夫托尔斯泰（1828-1910），十九世纪俄国对世界文学最有影响的作家。《复活》是他的代表作之一。本书取材于一件真实事件，主要描写男主人公涅赫柳多夫引诱姑妈家女仆马洛斯娃，使她怀孕并被赶出家门。后来，她沦为妓女，因被指控谋财害命而受审判。男主人公以陪审员的...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/328","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM"}}
