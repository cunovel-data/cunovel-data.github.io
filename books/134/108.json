{"id":3918,"no":108,"title":"Part 3 Chapter 7","content":"NEKHLUDOFF SEEKS AN INTERVIEW WITH MASLOVA.\\n\\n On the day when the convoy officer had the encounter with the prisoners at the halting station about the child, Nekhludoff, who had spent the night at the village inn, woke up late, and was some time writing letters to post at the next Government town, so that he left the inn later than usual, and did not catch up with the gang on the road as he had done previously, but came to the village where the next halting station was as it was growing dusk.\\n\\n Having dried himself at the inn, which was kept by an elderly woman who had an extraordinarily fat, white neck, he had his tea in a clean room decorated with a great number of icons and pictures and then hurried away to the halting station to ask the officer for an interview with Katusha. At the last six halting stations he could not get the permission for an interview from any of the officers. Though they had been changed several times, not one of them would allow Nekhludoff inside the halting stations, so that he had not seen Katusha for more than a week. This strictness was occasioned by the fact that an important prison official was expected to pass that way. Now this official had passed without looking in at the gang, after all, and Nekhludoff hoped that the officer who had taken charge of the gang in the morning would allow him an interview with the prisoners, as former officers had done.\\n\\n The landlady offered Nekhludoff a trap to drive him to the halting station, situated at the farther end of the village, but Nekhludoff preferred to walk. A young labourer, a broad-shouldered young fellow of herculean dimensions, with enormous top-boots freshly blackened with strongly smelling tar, offered himself as a guide.\\n\\n A dense mist obscured the sky, and it was so dark that when the young fellow was three steps in advance of him Nekhludoff could not see him unless the light of some window happened to fall on the spot, but he could hear the heavy boots wading through the deep, sticky slush. After passing the open place in front of the church and the long street, with its rows of windows shining brightly in the darkness, Nekhludoff followed his guide to the outskirts of the village, where it was pitch dark. But soon here, too, rays of light, streaming through the mist from the lamps in the front of the halting station, became discernible through the darkness. The reddish spots of light grew bigger and bigger; at last the stakes of the palisade, the moving figure of the sentinel, a post painted with white and black stripes and the sentinel\u0027s box became visible.\\n\\n The sentinel called his usual \"Who goes there?\" as they approached, and seeing they were strangers treated them with such severity that he would not allow them to wait by the palisade; but Nekhludoff\u0027s guide was not abashed by this severity.\\n\\n \"Hallo, lad! why so fierce? You go and rouse your boss while we wait here?\"\\n\\n The sentinel gave no answer, but shouted something in at the gate and stood looking at the broad-shouldered young labourer scraping the mud off Nekhludoff\u0027s boots with a chip of wood by the light of the lamp. From behind the palisade came the hum of male and female voices. In about three minutes more something rattled, the gate opened, and a sergeant, with his cloak thrown over his shoulders, stepped out of the darkness into the lamplight.\\n\\n The sergeant was not as strict as the sentinel, but he was extremely inquisitive. He insisted on knowing what Nekhludoff wanted the officer for, and who he was, evidently scenting his booty and anxious not to let it escape. Nekhludoff said he had come on special business, and would show his gratitude, and would the sergeant take a note for him to the officer. The sergeant took the note, nodded, and went away. Some time after the gate rattled again, and women carrying baskets, boxes, jugs and sacks came out, loudly chattering in their peculiar Siberian dialect as they stepped over the threshold of the gate. None of them wore peasant costumes, but were dressed town fashion, wearing jackets and fur-lined cloaks. Their skirts were tucked up high, and their heads wrapped up in shawls. They examined Nekhludoff and his guide curiously by the light of the lamp. One of them showed evident pleasure at the sight of the broad-shouldered fellow, and affectionately administered to him a dose of Siberian abuse.\\n\\n \"You demon, what are you doing here? The devil take you,\" she said, addressing him.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve been showing this traveller here the way,\" answered the young fellow. \"And what have you been bringing here?\"\\n\\n \"Dairy produce, and I am to bring more in the morning.\"\\n\\n The guide said something in answer that made not only the women but even the sentinel laugh, and, turning to Nekhludoff, he said:\\n\\n \"You\u0027ll find your way alone? Won\u0027t get lost, will you?\"\\n\\n \"I shall find it all right.\"\\n\\n \"When you have passed the church it\u0027s the second from the two-storied house. Oh, and here, take my staff,\" he said, handing the stick he was carrying, and which was longer than himself, to Nekhludoff; and splashing through the mud with his enormous boots, he disappeared in the darkness, together with the women.\\n\\n His voice mingling with the voices of the women was still audible through the fog, when the gate again rattled, and the sergeant appeared and asked Nekhludoff to follow him to the officer.\\n\\n 押解官同犯人从旅站出发时为一个孩子发生冲突的那一天，聂赫留朵夫在客店里正好醒得很迟，起身后又写了几封信，准备带到省城去寄，因此坐车离开客店晚了一点，没象往常那样在途中赶上大队人马。他到达犯人们过夜的村子时，已经黄昏了。聂赫留朵夫借宿的客店是由一个身体肥胖、脖子又白又粗的老寡妇开设的。他在那里烘干衣服，在饰有大量圣像和画片的干净客房里喝够了茶，连忙赶到旅站去找押解官，要求准许他同玛丝洛娃见面。\\n\\n 在过去的六个旅站上，尽管押解官不断更换，但没有一个准许聂赫留朵夫进入旅站房间，因此他已有一个多星期没见到玛丝洛娃了。他们所以这样严格，是因为有一个管监狱的大官将路过此地。如今，那个长官已经过去，根本没有对旅站看上一眼。聂赫留朵夫希望今天接管这批犯人的押解官能准许他同犯人见面。\\n\\n 客店女掌柜劝聂赫留朵夫坐车到村尾的旅站，但聂赫留朵夫情愿走着去。一个肩膀宽阔、体格魁伟的年轻茶房，脚穿一双刚擦过油、柏油味很重的大皮靴，给他带路。空中一片迷雾，天色黑得厉害。领路的茶房在灯光照不到的地方只要走出三步，聂赫留朵夫就看不见他，只听见他的大皮靴在厚厚的泥浆里咕唧咕唧地响。\\n\\n 聂赫留朵夫跟着带路的茶房穿过教堂前的广场和两边房子灯火通明的街道，来到漆黑的村尾。但不多一会儿，黑暗中又出现了亮光，那是旅站附近的路灯透过迷雾发出来的。那些淡红色的灯火越来越大，越来越亮。栅栏的木桩、走动的哨兵的黑影、漆成条纹的木柱和岗亭渐渐隐约可见。哨兵看见有人走近，照例吆喝一声：“谁？”他发觉来的不是自己人，顿时变得十分严厉，坚决不准他们在栅栏旁逗留。不过，给聂赫留朵夫领路的茶房看见哨兵态度严厉，并不慌张。\\n\\n “嗨，你这小子，脾气倒不小哇！”他对哨兵说。“你去叫你们的头儿出来，我们在这儿等着。”\\n\\n 哨兵没有答话，只对着边门喊了一声，停住脚步，眼睛盯着那肩膀宽阔的小伙子，看他怎样就着灯光用木片刮掉聂赫留朵夫靴上的泥泞。栅栏里传出来男男女女嘈杂的说话声。过了三分钟光景，边门哗啦一声开了，队长身披军大衣，从黑暗中来到路灯下，问他们有什么事。聂赫留朵夫把准备好的名片和一张写明有私事求见的字条交给队长，请他转送押解官。那队长不象哨兵那样严厉，但好奇心特别重。他一定要知道聂赫留朵夫有什么事要见押解官，他是什么人。显然，他已嗅到有油水可捞，不肯放过机会。聂赫留朵夫说他有一桩特殊的事，要他把字条送上去，办成后他会感谢他的。队长接过字条，点点头走了。他走后不多一会儿，边门又哗啦响了一声，走出几个女人，手里拿着筐子、树皮篮、牛奶壶和袋子。她们声音响亮地用西伯利亚方言交谈着，跨过边门的门槛。她们都不是乡下人打扮，而象城里人那样穿着大衣和皮袄，裙子高高地掖在腰里，头上包着头巾。她们借路灯的光好奇地打量着聂赫留朵夫和给他领路的人。其中一个女人看见这个宽肩膀的小伙子，显然很高兴，立刻用西伯利亚骂人话亲热地骂起他来。\\n\\n “你这该死的林鬼，到这儿来干什么？”她对他说。\\n\\n “你看，我送个客人到这儿来了，”小伙子回答。“你送什么东西来了？”\\n\\n “奶制品，他们要我明早再送些来。”\\n\\n “那么他们没有叫你留下来过夜吗？”小伙子问。\\n\\n “去你的，死鬼，烂掉你的舌头！”她笑着嚷道。“咱们一块儿回村子去，你送送我们。”\\n\\n 带路的还对她说了些什么笑话，不仅引得女人们咯咯地笑，就连哨兵也笑了起来。接着他对聂赫留朵夫说：\\n\\n “怎么样，您一个人回去找得着吗？不会迷路吧？”\\n\\n “找得着，找得着。”\\n\\n “过了教堂，从那座两层楼房子算起，右边第二家就是。喏，给您根拐棍，”他说，把随身带着的那根一人多高的棍子交给聂赫留朵夫。然后他踩着咕唧咕唧响的大皮靴，跟那些女人一起在黑暗中消失了。\\n\\n 半边门再次哗啦作响，队长请聂赫留朵夫跟他一起去见押解官时，从迷雾里还传来那小伙子的说话声，中间夹杂着女人的声音。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/328/3283.html","bookId":134,"book":{"id":134,"title":"复活 Resurrection","description":"简介： 列夫托尔斯泰（1828-1910），十九世纪俄国对世界文学最有影响的作家。《复活》是他的代表作之一。本书取材于一件真实事件，主要描写男主人公涅赫柳多夫引诱姑妈家女仆马洛斯娃，使她怀孕并被赶出家门。后来，她沦为妓女，因被指控谋财害命而受审判。男主人公以陪审员的...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/328","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM"}}
