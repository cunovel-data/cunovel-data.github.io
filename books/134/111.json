When they had passed the bachelors\u0027 room the sergeant who accompanied Nekhludoff left him, promising to come for him before the inspection would take place. As soon as the sergeant was gone a prisoner, quickly stepping with his bare feet and holding up the chains, came close up to Nekhludoff, enveloping him in the strong, acid smell of perspiration, and said in a mysterious whisper: \"Help the lad, sir; he\u0027s got into an awful mess. Been drinking. To-day he\u0027s given his name as Karmanoff at the inspection. Take his part, sir. We dare not, or they\u0027ll kill us,\" and looking uneasily round he turned away. This is what had happened. The criminal Kalmanoff had persuaded a young fellow who resembled him in appearance and was sentenced to exile to change names with him and go to the mines instead of him, while he only went to exile. Nekhludoff knew all this. Some convict had told him about this exchange the week before. He nodded as a sign that he understood and would do what was in his power, and continued his way without looking round. Nekhludoff knew this convict, and was surprised by his action. When in Ekaterinburg the convict had asked Nekhludoff to get a permission for his wife to follow him. The convict was a man of medium size and of the most ordinary peasant type, about thirty years old. He was condemned to hard labour for an attempt to murder and rob. His name was Makar Devkin. His crime was a very curious one. In the account he gave of it to Nekhludoff, he said it was not his but his devil\u0027s doing. He said that a traveller had come to his father\u0027s house and hired his sledge to drive him to a village thirty miles off for two roubles. Makar\u0027s father told him to drive the stranger. Makar harnessed the horse, dressed, and sat down to drink tea with the stranger. The stranger related at the tea-table that he was going to be married and had five hundred roubles, which he had earned in Moscow, with him. When he had heard this, Makar went out into the yard and put an axe into the sledge under the straw. \"And I did not myself know why I was taking the axe,\" he said. \"\u0027Take the axe,\u0027 says _he_, and I took it. We got in and started. We drove along all right; I even forgot about the axe. Well, we were getting near the village; only about four miles more to go. The way from the cross-road to the high road was up hill, and I got out. I walked behind the sledge and _he_ whispers to me, \u0027What are you thinking about? When you get to the top of the hill you will meet people along the highway, and then there will be the village. He will carry the money away. If you mean to do it, now\u0027s the time.\u0027 I stooped over the sledge as if to arrange the straw, and the axe seemed to jump into my hand of itself. The man turned round. \u0027What are you doing?\u0027 I lifted the axe and tried to knock him down, but he was quick, jumped out, and took hold of my hands. \u0027What are you doing, you villain?\u0027 He threw me down into the snow, and I did not even struggle, but gave in at once. He bound my arms with his girdle, and threw me into the sledge, and took me straight to the police station. I was imprisoned and tried. The commune gave me a good character, said that I was a good man, and that nothing wrong had been noticed about me. The masters for whom I worked also spoke well of me, but we had no money to engage a lawyer, and so I was condemned to four years\u0027 hard labour.\" It was this man who, wishing to save a fellow-villager, knowing that he was risking his life thereby, told Nekhludoff the prisoner\u0027s secret, for doing which (if found out) he should certainly be throttled. 护送聂赫留朵夫的军士经过单身犯牢房时对聂赫留朵夫说，他将在点名前来接他，然后转身走了。军士刚走开，就有一个男犯提起镣铐上的铁链，光着脚，快步走到聂赫留朵夫跟前，浑身发出一股浓重的汗酸臭，偷偷地对他说： “老爷，您出头管一下吧。那小子上了当。人家把他灌醉了。今天交接犯人的时候，他竟冒名顶替，说自己是卡尔玛诺夫。您出头管一下吧，我们可不能管，不然会被打死的，”那个男犯说，神色慌张地向四周看了一下，立刻从聂赫留朵夫身边溜走。 事情是这样的：一个叫卡尔玛诺夫的苦役犯，怂恿一个相貌同他相似的终身流放犯同他互换姓名，这样苦役犯就可以改为流放，而流放犯却要代替他去服苦役。 这件事聂赫留朵夫已经知道，因为那个犯人上礼拜就把这个骗局告诉了他。聂赫留朵夫点点头表示明白，并将尽力去办，然后头也不回地往前走去。 聂赫留朵夫在叶卡捷琳堡就认识这个犯人了，他当时请聂赫留朵夫替他说情，准许他去服苦役，把妻子一起带去。聂赫留朵夫对他的要求感到惊奇。这人中等身材，生有一个最普通的农民脸型，三十岁光景，因蓄意谋财害命而被判服苦役。他名叫玛卡尔。他犯罪的经过很奇怪。他对聂赫留朵夫说，这罪不是他玛卡尔犯的，而是他魔鬼犯的。他说，有个过路人找到他父亲，愿意出两个卢布要他父亲用雪橇把他送到四十俄里外的村子去。父亲就吩咐玛卡尔把他送去。玛卡尔套好雪橇，穿上衣服，就同那过路人一起喝茶。过路人一面喝茶，一面告诉他要回家成亲，随身带着在莫斯科挣到的五百卢布。玛卡尔听了这话，就走到院子里，找了一把斧子藏在雪橇草垫下。 “连我自己也不知道为什么要带斧子，”他讲道，“只听得有个声音对我说：‘带上斧子。’我就把斧子带上。我们坐上雪橇出发。一路走去，什么事也没有。我也把那斧子给忘了。直到离村子不远，只剩下六俄里路，我们的雪橇离开村道，走上大路，往山坡上爬去。我就从雪橇上下来，跟在后面，这时他又低声对我说：‘你还在犹豫什么呀？你一到山上，大路上就有人，前头就是村子。他就会带着钱走掉。要干，现在就得动手，还等什么呀？’我弯下腰，装作整理一下雪橇上铺着的草，那斧子仿佛自动跳到我手里。他回过头来对我一看，说：‘你要干什么？’我抡起斧子，想把他一家伙劈死，可他这人挺机灵，霍地跳下雪橇，一把抓住我的手，说：‘混蛋，你想干什么？……’他把我推倒在雪地上，我也不还手，听他摆布。他用腰带捆住我的双手，把我扔在雪橇上。他就把我送到区警察局。我就坐了牢，后来开庭审判。我们的村社替我说好话，说我是个好人，从来没有做过坏事。我的东家也替我说好话。可是我们没有钱请律师，我就被判了四年苦役。” 现在，就是这样一个人要搭救同乡。他明明知道，这事有生命危险，但他还是把犯人中的秘密告诉了聂赫留朵夫，万一人家知道这事是他干的，准会把他活活勒死。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/328/3286.html","bookId":134,"book":{"id":134,"title":"复活 Resurrection","description":"简介： 列夫托尔斯泰（1828-1910），十九世纪俄国对世界文学最有影响的作家。《复活》是他的代表作之一。本书取材于一件真实事件，主要描写男主人公涅赫柳多夫引诱姑妈家女仆马洛斯娃，使她怀孕并被赶出家门。后来，她沦为妓女，因被指控谋财害命而受审判。男主人公以陪审员的...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/328","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM"}}
