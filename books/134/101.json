Before Nekhludoff got out he had noticed in the station yard several elegant equipages, some with three, some with four, well-fed horses, with tinkling bells on their harness. When he stepped out on the wet, dark-coloured boards of the platform, he saw a group of people in front of the first-class carriage, among whom were conspicuous a stout lady with costly feathers on her hat, and a waterproof, and a tall, thin-legged young man in a cycling suit. The young man had by his side an enormous, well-fed dog, with a valuable collar. Behind them stood footmen, holding wraps and umbrellas, and a coachman, who had also come to meet the train. On the whole of the group, from the fat lady down to the coachman who stood holding up his long coat, there lay the stamp of wealth and quiet self-assurance. A curious and servile crowd rapidly gathered round this group--the station-master, in his red cap, a gendarme, a thin young lady in a Russian costume, with beads round her neck, who made a point of seeing the trains come in all through the summer, a telegraph clerk, and passengers, men and women. In the young man with the dog Nekhludoff recognised young Korchagin, a gymnasium student. The fat lady was the Princess\u0027s sister, to whose estate the Korchagins were now moving. The guard, with his gold cord and shiny top-boots, opened the carriage door and stood holding it as a sign of deference, while Philip and a porter with a white apron carefully carried out the long-faced Princess in her folding chair. The sisters greeted each other, and French sentences began flying about. Would the Princess go in a closed or an open carriage? At last the procession started towards the exit, the lady\u0027s maid, with her curly fringe, parasol and leather case in the rear. Nekhludoff not wishing to meet them and to have to take leave over again, stopped before he got to the door, waiting for the procession to pass. The Princess, her son, Missy, the doctor, and the maid went out first, the old Prince and his sister-in-law remained behind. Nekhludoff was too far to catch anything but a few disconnected French sentences of their conversation One of the sentences uttered by the Prince, as it often happens, for some unaccountable reason remained in his memory with all its intonations and the sound of the voice. \"_Oh, il est du vrai grand monde, du vrai grand monde_,\" said the Prince in his loud, self-assured tone as he went out of the station with his sister-in-law, accompanied by the respectful guards and porters. At this moment from behind the corner of the station suddenly appeared a crowd of workmen in bark shoes, wearing sheepskin coats and carrying bags on their backs. The workmen went up to the nearest carriage with soft yet determined steps, and were about to get in, but were at once driven away by a guard. Without stopping, the workmen passed on, hurrying and jostling one another, to the next carriage and began getting in, catching their bags against the corners and door of the carriage, but another guard caught sight of them from the door of the station, and shouted at them severely. The workmen, who had already got in, hurried out again and went on, with the same soft and firm steps, still further towards Nekhludoff\u0027s carriage. A guard was again going to stop them, but Nekhludoff said there was plenty of room inside, and that they had better get in. They obeyed and got in, followed by Nekhludoff. The workmen were about to take their seats, when the gentleman with the cockade and the two ladies, looking at this attempt to settle in their carriage as a personal insult to themselves, indignantly protested and wanted to turn them out. The workmen--there were 20 of them, old men and quite young ones, all of them wearied, sunburnt, with haggard faces--began at once to move on through the carriage, catching the seats, the walls, and the doors with their bags. They evidently felt they had offended in some way, and seemed ready to go on indefinitely wherever they were ordered to go. \"Where are you pushing to, you fiends? Sit down here,\" shouted another guard they met. \"Voild encore des nouvelles,\" exclaimed the younger of the two ladies, quite convinced that she would attract Nekhludoff\u0027s notice by her good French. The other lady with the bracelets kept sniffing and making faces, and remarked something about how pleasant it was to sit with smelly peasants. The workmen, who felt the joy and calm experienced by people who have escaped some kind of danger, threw off their heavy bags with a movement of their shoulders and stowed them away under the seats. The gardener had left his own seat to talk with Taras, and now went back, so that there were two unoccupied seats opposite and one next to Taras. Three of the workmen took these seats, but when Nekhludoff came up to them, in his gentleman\u0027s clothing, they got so confused that they rose to go away, but Nekhludoff asked them to stay, and himself sat down on the arm of the seat, by the passage down the middle of the carriage. One of the workmen, a man of about 50, exchanged a surprised and even frightened look with a young man. That Nekhludoff, instead of scolding and driving them away, as was natural to a gentleman, should give up his seat to them, astonished and perplexed them. They even feared that this might have some evil result for them. However, they soon noticed that there was no underlying plot when they heard Nekhludoff talking quite simply with Taras, and they grew quiet and told one of the lads to sit down on his bag and give his seat to Nekhludoff. At first the elderly workman who sat opposite Nekhludoff shrank and drew back his legs for fear of touching the gentleman, but after a while he grew quite friendly, and in talking to him and Taras even slapped Nekhludoff on the knee when he wanted to draw special attention to what he was saying. He told them all about his position and his work in the peat bogs, whence he was now returning home. He had been working there for two and a half months, and was bringing home his wages, which only came to 10 roubles, since part had been paid beforehand when he was hired. They worked, as he explained, up to their knees in water from sunrise to sunset, with two hours\u0027 interval for dinner. \"Those who are not used to it find it hard, of course,\" he said; \"but when one\u0027s hardened it doesn\u0027t matter, if only the food is right. At first the food was bad. Later the people complained, and they got good food, and it was easy to work.\" Then he told them how, during 28 years he went out to work, and sent all his earnings home. First to his father, then to his eldest brother, and now to his nephew, who was at the head of the household. On himself he spent only two or three roubles of the 50 or 60 he earned a year, just for luxuries--tobacco and matches. \"I\u0027m a sinner, when tired I even drink a little vodka sometimes,\" he added, with a guilty smile. Then he told them how the women did the work at home, and how the contractor had treated them to half a pail of vodka before they started to-day, how one of them had died, and another was returning home ill. The sick workman he was talking about was in a corner of the same carriage. He was a young lad, with a pale, sallow face and bluish lips. He was evidently tormented by intermittent fever. Nekhludoff went up to him, but the lad looked up with such a severe and suffering expression that Nekhludoff did not care to bother him with questions, but advised the elder man to give him quinine, and wrote down the name of the medicine. He wished to give him some money, but the old workman said he would pay for it himself. \"Well, much as I have travelled, I have never met such a gentleman before. Instead of punching your head, he actually gives up his place to you,\" said the old man to Taras. \"It seems there are all sorts of gentlefolk, too.\" \"Yes, this is quite a new and different world,\" thought Nekhludoff, looking at these spare, sinewy, limbs, coarse, home-made garments, and sunburnt, kindly, though weary-looking faces, and feeling himself surrounded on all sides with new people and the serious interests, joys, and sufferings of a life of labour. \"Here is_ le vrai grand monde_,\" thought Nekhludoff, remembering the words of Prince Korchagin and all that idle, luxurious world to which the Korchagins belonged, with their petty, mean interests. And he felt the joy of a traveller on discovering a new, unknown, and beautiful world. 聂赫留朵夫还没有走出车厢，就看见车站广场上停着几辆豪华的马车，都套有三、四匹膘肥体壮的骏马，马脖子上挂着丁当作响的小铃铛。他走到被雨淋得潮湿发黑的站台上，一眼就看见头等车厢旁站着一伙人。其中最引人注目的是一个又高又胖的太太，头戴插有珍贵羽毛的帽子，身穿雨衣；再有一个高个子青年，两腿细长，穿一身自行车装，手里牵着一头脖子上套有贵重颈圈的肥壮大狗。他们后面站着几个仆人，手拿雨衣雨伞，还有一个马车夫，都是来接客的。这一伙人，从胖太太起到手提长袍前摆的马车夫止，个个都显得优裕富足，怡然自得。在这伙人四周顿时围了一批好奇成性、拜金成癖的人，其中包括戴红制帽的站长、一个宪兵、一个穿俄罗斯民族服装、颈戴项链、夏天里每逢有火车到必定赶来迎接的瘦姑娘、电报员和几个男女乘客。 聂赫留朵夫认出那个牵狗的青年就是在念中学的柯察金家少爷。那位胖太太就是公爵夫人的姐姐——柯察金一家就是搬到她的庄园来住的。列车长身穿金绦闪亮的制服，脚登擦得锃亮的皮靴，拉开车厢门，并且为了表示敬意，一直拉住那门，好让菲利浦和系白围裙的脚夫把马脸的公爵夫人坐着的圈椅小心抬下车来。两姐妹相互问好，还听到他们用法语商量，公爵夫人坐轿车还是篷车。于是队伍就以手拿阳伞和帽盒的鬈发侍女殿后，向车站出口处走去。 聂赫留朵夫不愿同他们再次见面，再次告别，就站住，等队伍浩浩荡荡地走出车站。公爵夫人带着儿子、米西、医生和侍女走在前头，老公爵和他的妻姐跟在后面。聂赫留朵夫没有走到他们跟前去，只能听见他们用法语交谈的片言只语。在公爵所讲的话中，有一句不知怎的——当然这种情况也是常有的，——连同他的腔调和声音都深深印进聂赫留朵夫的脑海里。 “啊！他可真正是个上等人，真正是个上等人，”公爵用洪亮而自信的声音讲到什么人，在毕恭毕敬的列车员和脚夫的簇拥下，同妻姐一起走出车站。 就在这时候，车站拐角处出现了一群不知从哪儿来的工人。他们穿着树皮鞋，背着羊皮袄和袋子，向站台走来。工人们迈着矫健的步子走到最近一节车厢旁边，想上去，可是立刻被列车员赶走了。工人们没有停下，又匆匆向前走去，彼此踩着脚，来到旁边那节车厢门口登上火车。他们背上的袋子不断地撞在车角和车门上。这当儿另一个列车员在车站出口处看见他们要上车，就恶狠狠地对他们吆喝起来。已经上车的工人连忙下车，又迈着同样矫健的步子，向下一节车厢走去。聂赫留朵夫就坐在那节车厢里。列车员又把他们拦住。他们刚站住，准备继续向前走，但聂赫留朵夫对他们说，车厢里有空位子，可以上去。他们听从他的话，聂赫留朵夫跟在他们后面上了车。工人们正要各自找位子坐下，可是那个帽子上有帽徽的老爷和两位太太看见他们胆敢坐到他们这节车厢里来，认为这是对他们的侮辱，坚决反对，把他们赶了出去。这批工人有年纪老的，有年纪很轻的，总共二十人光景，个个又黑又瘦，满面风霜。他们受到老爷太太的驱逐，显然觉得自己错了，立刻穿过车厢往前走，他们背上的袋子不住地撞在车座、板壁和车门上。他们的神情似乎准备走到天涯海角，坐到人家吩咐他们坐的任何地方，哪怕是坐到钉子上也行。 “你们闯到哪儿去，鬼东西！就在这儿找个位子坐下！”另一个列车员迎着他们走来，嚷道。 “这倒是件新鲜事儿！”两位太太中年轻的那一位说，自以为她那口漂亮的法国话会吸引聂赫留朵夫的注意。那位戴手镯的太太只是皱起眉头，嗅个不停，嘴里嘲弄说，跟这批臭庄稼佬坐在一起真是受惠不浅。 工人们却象度过重大危险似的，感到如释重负，心情轻松，站停下来，分头找位子坐下，动动肩膀，卸下背上的袋子，把它们塞到座位底下。 同塔拉斯攀谈的花匠坐的不是他自己的位子，这时就回到自己的座位上去。这样，塔拉斯旁边和对面就空出三个位子来。有三个工人就坐在这些空位子上，可是聂赫留朵夫一走到他们跟前，他那副老爷的装束使他们手足无措。他们站起来想走，聂赫留朵夫却叫他们坐着不要动，自己在靠近过道座位的扶手上坐下来。 那几个工人中，有一个五十岁光景的老头同一个年纪轻的交换了一下眼色，露出疑惑甚至恐惧的神色。聂赫留朵夫不象一般做老爷的那样对他们呼幺喝六，把他们赶走，反而给他们让座，这使他们感到惊讶，弄不懂是怎么一回事。他们甚至担心到头来会不会出什么对他们不利的事。不过，他们看到这里并没有什么阴谋诡计，聂赫留朵夫同塔拉斯谈话也很随便，他们才放下心来，吩咐一个小伙子坐在袋子上，请聂赫留朵夫坐到自己的位子上去。那个上了年纪的工人坐在聂赫留朵夫对面，起初畏畏缩缩，拚命把穿着树皮鞋的脚缩起来，免得碰到老爷的脚，但后来同聂赫留朵夫和塔拉斯谈得很投机，在他想让聂赫留朵夫注意自己的话时，还用手背碰碰聂赫留朵夫的膝盖。他讲到自己的种种情况，讲到泥炭田的工作。原来他们在泥炭田里干了两个半月活，每人大约挣了十个卢布——有一部分工资他们在受雇时已经预支了，——现在就是带着工钱回家去。他讲到，他们干活总是在没膝深的水中，从日出干到日落，中午吃饭休息两小时。 “谁没有干惯，干这活当然很苦，”他说，“但干惯了，也就不觉得苦了。就是伙食要象样。起初伙食很糟，大伙儿都挺不满意，后来伙食有了改进，干活也就轻松了。” 接下去他讲到，他在外面做了二十八年工，总是把全部工钱都寄回家，开头交给父亲，后来交给哥哥，现在则交给当家的侄儿。他每年挣五六十卢布，自己只花两三个卢布，买点烟草和火柴，找点乐子。 “罪过，有时候累了，也喝一点儿伏特加，”他露出负疚的微笑，补了一句。 他还讲到，男人出门后女人怎样当家，今天回家以前包工头怎样请他们喝了半桶白酒，还讲到他们中间死了一个人，另外有一个生了病，现在由他们送回家去。那个病人就坐在这节车厢的角落里。他还是个孩子，脸色灰白，嘴唇发青。他显然在发疟子，还没有退烧。聂赫留朵夫走到他跟前，但那孩子那么严厉而痛苦地对他瞅了一眼，弄得聂赫留朵夫不敢问什么，只是劝老头儿给他买些奎宁来吃，并在一张小纸片上写了药名交给他。聂赫留朵夫想给些钱，可是老头儿说不需要，他自己会买的。 “哦，我出过多少次门，这样的老爷还没有见过。他不仅不揍你，还让位子给你坐。可见老爷也是各各不同的，”他最后对塔拉斯说。 “是啊，这可是一个截然不同的世界，一个崭新的世界，”聂赫留朵夫瞧着这些筋骨强壮而又干瘦如柴的四肢、粗糙的土布衣服，以及黧黑、疲劳而亲切的脸庞，心里想，同时觉得他周围这些人，过着真正的劳动生活，他们有严肃的兴趣、欢乐和痛苦，他们才是彻头彻尾的新人。 “瞧，他们才是真正的上等人，”聂赫留朵夫想起了柯察金公爵说过的这句话，同时想起了柯察金之流的那个游手好闲，穷奢极侈的世界以及他们猥琐无聊的兴趣。 他好象一个旅行家，发现了一个陌生而美丽的新世界，为此感到兴高采烈。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/328/3276.html","bookId":134,"book":{"id":134,"title":"复活 Resurrection","description":"简介： 列夫托尔斯泰（1828-1910），十九世纪俄国对世界文学最有影响的作家。《复活》是他的代表作之一。本书取材于一件真实事件，主要描写男主人公涅赫柳多夫引诱姑妈家女仆马洛斯娃，使她怀孕并被赶出家门。后来，她沦为妓女，因被指控谋财害命而受审判。男主人公以陪审员的...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/328","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM"}}
