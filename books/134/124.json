{"id":3934,"no":124,"title":"Part 3 Chapter 23","content":"THE SENTENCE COMMUTED. \"By-the-way, where are you staying?\" asked the General as he was taking leave of Nekhludoff. \"At Duke\u0027s? Well, it\u0027s horrid enough there. Come and dine with us at five o\u0027clock. You speak English?\" \"Yes, I do.\" \"That\u0027s good. You see, an English traveller has just arrived here. He is studying the question of transportation and examining the prisons of Siberia. Well, he is dining with us to-night, and you come and meet him. We dine at five, and my wife expects punctuality. Then I shall also give you an answer what to do about that woman, and perhaps it may be possible to leave some one behind with the sick prisoner.\" Having made his bow to the General, Nekhludoff drove to the post-office, feeling himself in an extremely animated and energetic frame of mind. The post-office was a low-vaulted room. Several officials sat behind a counter serving the people, of whom there was quite a crowd. One official sat with his head bent to one side and kept stamping the envelopes, which he slipped dexterously under the stamp. Nekhludoff had not long to wait. As soon as he had given his name, everything that had come for him by post was at once handed to him. There was a good deal: letters, and money, and books, and the last number of Fatherland Notes. Nekhludoff took all these things to a wooden bench, on which a soldier with a book in his hand sat waiting for something, took the seat by his side, and began sorting the letters. Among them was one registered letter in a fine envelope, with a distinctly stamped bright red seal. He broke the seal, and seeing a letter from Selenin and some official paper inside the envelope, he felt the blood rush to his face, and his heart stood still. It was the answer to Katusha\u0027s petition. What would that answer be? Nekhludoff glanced hurriedly through the letter, written in an illegibly small, hard, and cramped hand, and breathed a sigh of relief. The answer was a favourable one. \"Dear friend,\" wrote Selenin, \"our last talk has made a profound impression on me. You were right concerning Maslova. I looked carefully through the case, and see that shocking injustice has been done her. It could he remedied only by the Committee of Petitions before which you laid it. I managed to assist at the examination of the case, and I enclose herewith the copy of the mitigation of the sentence. Your aunt, the Countess Katerina Ivanovna, gave me the address which I am sending this to. The original document has been sent to the place where she was imprisoned before her trial, and will from there he probably sent at once to the principal Government office in Siberia. I hasten to communicate this glad news to you and warmly press your hand. \"Yours, \"SELENIN.\" The document ran thus: \"His Majesty\u0027s office for the reception of petitions, addressed to his Imperial name\"--here followed the date----\"by order of the chief of his Majesty\u0027s office for the reception of petitions addressed to his Imperial name. The meschanka Katerina Maslova is hereby informed that his Imperial Majesty, with reference to her most loyal petition, condescending to her request, deigns to order that her sentence to hard labour should be commuted to one of exile to the less distant districts of Siberia.\" This was joyful and important news; all that Nekhludoff could have hoped for Katusha, and for himself also, had happened. It was true that the new position she was in brought new complications with it. While she was a convict, marriage with her could only be fictitious, and would have had no meaning except that he would have been in a position to alleviate her condition. And now there was nothing to prevent their living together, and Nekhludoff had not prepared himself for that. And, besides, what of her relations to Simonson? What was the meaning of her words yesterday? If she consented to a union with Simonson, would it be well? He could not unravel all these questions, and gave up thinking about it. \"It will all clear itself up later on,\" he thought; \"I must not think about it now, but convey the glad news to her as soon as possible, and set her free.\" He thought that the copy of the document he had received would suffice, so when he left the post-office he told the isvostchik to drive him to the prison. Though he had received no order from the governor to visit the prison that morning, he knew by experience that it was easy to get from the subordinates what the higher officials would not grant, so now he meant to try and get into the prison to bring Katusha the joyful news, and perhaps to get her set free, and at the same time to inquire about Kryltzoff\u0027s state of health, and tell him and Mary Pavlovna what the general had said. The prison inspector was a tall, imposing-looking man, with moustaches and whiskers that twisted towards the corners of his mouth. He received Nekhludoff very gravely, and told him plainly that he could not grant an outsider the permission to interview the prisoners without a special order from his chief. To Nekhludoff\u0027s remark that he had been allowed to visit the prisoners even in the cities he answered: \"That may be so, but I do not allow it,\" and his tone implied, \"You city gentlemen may think to surprise and perplex us, but we in Eastern Siberia also know what the law is, and may even teach it you.\" The copy of a document straight from the Emperor\u0027s own office did not have any effect on the prison inspector either. He decidedly refused to let Nekhludoff come inside the prison walls. He only smiled contemptuously at Nekhludoff\u0027s naive conclusion, that the copy he had received would suffice to set Maslova free, and declared that a direct order from his own superiors would be needed before any one could be set at liberty. The only things he agreed to do were to communicate to Maslova that a mitigation had arrived for her, and to promise that he would not detain her an hour after the order from his chief to liberate her would arrive. He would also give no news of Kryltzoff, saying he could not even tell if there was such a prisoner; and so Nekhludoff, having accomplished next to nothing, got into his trap and drove back to his hotel. The strictness of the inspector was chiefly due to the fact that an epidemic of typhus had broken out in the prison, owing to twice the number of persons that it was intended for being crowded in it. The isvostchik who drove Nekhludoff said, \"Quite a lot of people are dying in the prison every day, some kind of disease having sprung up among them, so that as many as twenty were buried in one day.\" “哦，请问您在哪里下榻？在玖可夫旅馆吗？哦，那地方真是糟透了。回头您到我这儿来吃饭吧，”将军一面送走聂赫留朵夫，一面说，“下午五点钟。您会说英语吗？” “会，会说。” “哦，那太好了。不瞒您说，我们这儿来了一个英国人，是个旅行家。他在研究西伯利亚流放和监狱的情况。今天他要到我们这儿来吃饭，您也来吧。我们五点钟开饭，我妻子要求严格遵守时间。至于怎样处理那个女人，还有那个病人，我下午给您答复。也许可以留下一个人来照顾他。” 聂赫留朵夫辞别将军，心情特别振奋，就乘车到邮政局去。 邮政局设在一个低矮的拱顶房间里。几名邮务员坐在斜面办公桌后，把邮件分发给聚集在那里的人群。一个邮务员歪着脑袋，熟练地把一个个信封拉到面前，不停地打上邮戳。聂赫留朵夫没有久等，他一说出名字，就有一大堆邮件交到他手里。其中有汇款，有几封信，有几本书，还有最近一期的《祖国纪事》①。聂赫留朵夫收下信，走到木板长凳那边。长凳上坐着一个士兵，手里拿着一本小册子，正在等着领什么东西。聂赫留朵夫在他旁边坐下，翻阅收到的信。其中有一封是挂号信，信封很讲究，上面还盖有字迹清楚的鲜红火漆印。他拆开信封，看到信是谢列宁写的，还附着一份公文，血顿时涌上脸孔，心脏也缩紧了。这就是关于卡秋莎案的批复。是个怎样的批复？难道是驳回吗？聂赫留朵夫匆匆看了一下字迹很小、难以辨认、但笔力刚健的信，不由得高兴地舒了一口气。批复是令人满意的。 -------- ①彼得堡出版的学术、文学、政治综合性月刊，大部分出版年月倾向进步。 “亲爱的朋友！”谢列宁写道。“你上次同我的谈话给我留下深刻印象。关于玛丝洛娃一案，你的意见是正确的。我仔细查阅了这个案件，看出她受到不白之冤，确实令人愤慨。这事只能由你递交状子的上诉委员会来改正。我协助了他们裁决这个案件，现随信寄上减刑公文的副本，地址是叶卡吉琳娜·伊凡诺夫娜伯爵夫人给我的。公文正本已送往她当初受审的监禁地，即将转到西伯利亚总署。我赶紧把这个喜讯告诉你。友好地握你的手。你的谢列宁。” 公文内容如下：“皇帝陛下受理上告御状办公厅。案由某某号，案卷某某号。某某科，某年，某月，某日。奉皇帝陛下受理上告御状办公厅主任令，兹特通知小市民叶卡吉琳娜·玛丝洛娃，皇帝陛下披阅玛丝洛娃御状，体恤下情，恩准所请，着将该犯所判苦役改为流放，在西伯利亚较近处执行。” 这是一个大喜讯。凡是聂赫留朵夫希望为卡秋莎和自己做到的事，如今都已实现了。不错，她的地位发生了变化，他同她的关系也变得复杂了。以前她是个苦役犯，他提出要同她结婚，也只能徒具形式，至多稍稍改善她的处境罢了。如今可没有什么东西妨碍他们生活在一起了。可是聂赫留朵夫还没有做好这样的准备。再说，她同西蒙松的关系又怎么办呢？她昨天那番话究竟是什么意思？要是她同意跟西蒙松结合，这究竟是好事还是坏事？这些问题他怎么也搞不清楚，就索性不去想它们。“这一切以后都会清楚的，”他想，“现在得赶快去同她见面，把这个喜讯告诉她，把她释放出来。”他以为凭到手的副本就足以办到这一点。他走出邮政局，吩咐车夫把他送到监狱。 尽管将军没有准许上午探监，聂赫留朵夫凭经验知道，在上级长官那里绝对办不到的事，在下级官员那里倒很容易办到，因此决定先到监狱去一下，把这个喜讯告诉卡秋莎，也许就可以把她释放出来，同时打听一下克雷里卓夫的健康情况，并把将军的话转告他和谢基尼娜。 典狱长身材魁伟，威风凛凛，留着唇髭和一直长到嘴角的络腮胡子。他接待聂赫留朵夫很严厉，直率地声称，未经长官批准，他不能让任何人进去探监。聂赫留朵夫说，他在京城里也常去探监。典狱长听了回答说： “这很可能，但我不能容许这样做。”他说这话时的口气仿佛还表示：“你们这些京城里来的老爷，准以为可以吓唬我们，弄得我们束手无策，可我们虽然身居东西伯利亚，也知道严守法纪，还会给你们点颜色瞧瞧。” 皇帝陛下办公厅发的公文副本对典狱长也不起作用。他断然拒绝放聂赫留朵夫进监狱。聂赫留朵夫天真地以为他一出示公文副本，玛丝洛娃就可以当场获得释放，不料典狱长只轻蔑地微微一笑，声称要释放任何人犯，必须有他顶头上司的命令。他所能答应的只有一件事，那就是他可以通知玛丝洛娃，说她已获得减刑，一旦接到上级批文，就会立刻把她释放，不会耽搁一个钟头。 关于克雷里卓夫的健康，他也拒绝提供任何情况。他说他连有没有这样一个犯人都不清楚。聂赫留朵夫一无所获，只得坐上马车回旅馆。 典狱长所以这样严厉，主要是因为监狱里收容了比平常多一倍的犯人，拥挤不堪，而且伤寒流行。聂赫留朵夫的马车夫路上告诉他说：“监狱里人死得很多。那边流行瘟疫。每天都有二十人被埋葬。”","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/328/3299.html","bookId":134,"book":{"id":134,"title":"复活 Resurrection","description":"简介： 列夫托尔斯泰（1828-1910），十九世纪俄国对世界文学最有影响的作家。《复活》是他的代表作之一。本书取材于一件真实事件，主要描写男主人公涅赫柳多夫引诱姑妈家女仆马洛斯娃，使她怀孕并被赶出家门。后来，她沦为妓女，因被指控谋财害命而受审判。男主人公以陪审员的...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/328","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM"}}
