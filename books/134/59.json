{"id":3869,"no":59,"title":"Part 1 Chapter 59","content":"NEKHLUDOFF\u0027S THIRD INTERVIEW WITH MASLOVA IN PRISON.\\n\\n One of the most widespread superstitions is that every man has his own special, definite qualities; that a man is kind, cruel, wise, stupid, energetic, apathetic, etc. Men are not like that. We may say of a man that he is more often kind than cruel, oftener wise than stupid, oftener energetic than apathetic, or the reverse; but it would be false to say of one man that he is kind and wise, of another that he is wicked and foolish. And yet we always classify mankind in this way. And this is untrue. Men are like rivers: the water is the same in each, and alike in all; but every river is narrow here, is more rapid there, here slower, there broader, now clear, now cold, now dull, now warm. It is the same with men. Every man carries in himself the germs of every human quality, and sometimes one manifests itself, sometimes another, and the man often becomes unlike himself, while still remaining the same man, In some people these changes are very rapid, and Nekhludoff was such a man. These changes in him were due to physical and to spiritual causes. At this time he experienced such a change.\\n\\n That feeling of triumph and joy at the renewal of life which he had experienced after the trial and after the first interview with Katusha, vanished completely, and after the last interview fear and revulsion took the place of that joy. He was determined not to leave her, and not to change his decision of marrying her, if she wished it; but it seemed very hard, and made him suffer.\\n\\n On the day after his visit to Maslennikoff, he again went to the prison to see her.\\n\\n The inspector allowed him to speak to her, only not in the advocate\u0027s room nor in the office, but in the women\u0027s visiting-room. In spite of his kindness, the inspector was more reserved with Nekhludoff than hitherto.\\n\\n An order for greater caution had apparently been sent, as a result of his conversation with Meslennikoff.\\n\\n \"You may see her,\" the inspector said; \"but please remember what I said as regards money. And as to her removal to the hospital, that his excellency wrote to me about, it can be done; the doctor would agree. Only she herself does not wish it. She says, \u0027Much need have I to carry out the slops for the scurvy beggars.\u0027 You don\u0027t know what these people are, Prince,\" he added.\\n\\n Nekhludoff did not reply, but asked to have the interview. The inspector called a jailer, whom Nekhludoff followed into the women\u0027s visiting-room, where there was no one but Maslova waiting. She came from behind the grating, quiet and timid, close up to him, and said, without looking at him:\\n\\n \"Forgive me, Dmitri Ivanovitch, I spoke hastily the day before yesterday.\"\\n\\n \"It is not for me to forgive you,\" Nekhludoff began.\\n\\n \"But all the same, you must leave me,\" she interrupted, and in the terribly squinting eyes with which she looked at him Nekhludoff read the former strained, angry expression.\\n\\n \"Why should I leave you?\"\\n\\n \"So.\"\\n\\n \"But why so?\"\\n\\n She again looked up, as it seemed to him, with the same angry look.\\n\\n \"Well, then, thus it is,\" she said. \"You must leave me. It is true what I am saying. I cannot. You just give it up altogether.\" Her lips trembled and she was silent for a moment. \"It is true. I\u0027d rather hang myself.\"\\n\\n Nekhludoff felt that in this refusal there was hatred and unforgiving resentment, but there was also something besides, something good. This confirmation of the refusal in cold blood at once quenched all the doubts in Nekhludoff\u0027s bosom, and brought back the serious, triumphant emotion he had felt in relation to Katusha.\\n\\n \"Katusha, what I have said I will again repeat,\" he uttered, very seriously. \"I ask you to marry me. If you do not wish it, and for as long as you do not wish it, I shall only continue to follow you, and shall go where you are taken.\"\\n\\n \"That is your business. I shall not say anything more,\" she answered, and her lips began to tremble again.\\n\\n He, too, was silent, feeling unable to speak.\\n\\n \"I shall now go to the country, and then to Petersburg,\" he said, when he was quieter again. \"I shall do my utmost to get your--- our case, I mean, reconsidered, and by the help of God the sentence may be revoked.\"\\n\\n \"And if it is not revoked, never mind. I have deserved it, if not in this case, in other ways,\" she said, and he saw how difficult it was for her to keep down her tears.\\n\\n \"Well, have you seen Menshoff?\" she suddenly asked, to hide her emotion. \"It\u0027s true they are innocent, isn\u0027t it?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, I think so.\"\\n\\n \"Such a splendid old woman,\" she said.\\n\\n There was another pause.\\n\\n \"Well, and as to the hospital?\" she suddenly said, and looking at him with her squinting eyes. \"If you like, I will go, and I shall not drink any spirits, either.\"\\n\\n Nekhludoff looked into her eyes. They were smiling.\\n\\n \"Yes, yes, she is quite a different being,\" Nekhludoff thought. After all his former doubts, he now felt something he had never before experienced--the certainty that love is invincible.\\n\\n When Maslova returned to her noisome cell after this interview, she took off her cloak and sat down in her place on the shelf bedstead with her hands folded on her lap. In the cell were only the consumptive woman, the Vladimir woman with her baby, Menshoff\u0027s old mother, and the watchman\u0027s wife. The deacon\u0027s daughter had the day before been declared mentally diseased and removed to the hospital. The rest of the women were away, washing clothes. The old woman was asleep, the cell door stood open, and the watchman\u0027s children were in the corridor outside. The Vladimir woman, with her baby in her arms, and the watchman\u0027s wife, with the stocking she was knitting with deft fingers, came up to Maslova. \"Well, have you had a chat?\" they asked. Maslova sat silent on the high bedstead, swinging her legs, which did not reach to the floor.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s the good of snivelling?\" said the watchman\u0027s wife. \"The chief thing\u0027s not to go down into the dumps. Eh, Katusha? Now, then!\" and she went on, quickly moving her fingers.\\n\\n Maslova did not answer.\\n\\n \"And our women have all gone to wash,\" said the Vladimir woman. \"I heard them say much has been given in alms to-day. Quite a lot has been brought.\"\\n\\n \"Finashka,\" called out the watchman\u0027s wife, \"where\u0027s the little imp gone to?\"\\n\\n She took a knitting needle, stuck it through both the ball and the stocking, and went out into the corridor.\\n\\n At this moment the sound of women\u0027s voices was heard from the corridor, and the inmates of the cell entered, with their prison shoes, but no stockings on their feet. Each was carrying a roll, some even two. Theodosia came at once up to Maslova.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s the matter; is anything wrong?\" Theodosia asked, looking lovingly at Maslova with her clear, blue eyes. \"This is for our tea,\" and she put the rolls on a shelf.\\n\\n \"Why, surely he has not changed his mind about marrying?\" asked Korableva.\\n\\n \"No, he has not, but I don\u0027t wish to,\" said Maslova, \"and so I told him.\"\\n\\n \"More fool you!\" muttered Korableva in her deep tones.\\n\\n \"If one\u0027s not to live together, what\u0027s the use of marrying?\" said Theodosia.\\n\\n \"There\u0027s your husband--he\u0027s going with you,\" said the watchman\u0027s wife.\\n\\n \"Well, of course, we\u0027re married,\" said Theodosia. \"But why should he go through the ceremony if he is not to live with her?\"\\n\\n \"Why, indeed! Don\u0027t be a fool! You know if he marries her she\u0027ll roll in wealth,\" said Korableva.\\n\\n \"He says, \u0027Wherever they take you, I\u0027ll follow,\u0027\" said Maslova. \"If he does, it\u0027s well; if he does not, well also. I am not going to ask him to. Now he is going to try and arrange the matter in Petersburg. He is related to all the Ministers there. But, all the same, I have no need of him,\" she continued.\\n\\n \"Of course not,\" suddenly agreed Korableva, evidently thinking about something else as she sat examining her bag. \"Well, shall we have a drop?\"\\n\\n \"You have some,\" replied Maslova. \"I won\u0027t.\"\\n\\n 有一种迷信流传很广，认为每一个人都有固定的天性：有的善良，有的凶恶，有的聪明，有的愚笨，有的热情，有的冷漠，等等。其实人并不是这样的。我们可以说，有些人善良的时候多于凶恶的时候，聪明的时候多于愚笨的时候，热情的时候多于冷漠的时候，或者正好相反。但要是我们说一个人善良或者聪明，说另一个人凶恶或者愚笨，那就不对了。可我们往往是这样区分人的。这是不符合实际情况的。人好象河流，河水都一样，到处相同，但每一条河都是有的地方河身狭窄，水流湍急，有的地方河身宽阔，水流缓慢，有的地方河水清澈，有的地方河水浑浊，有的地方河水冰凉，有的地方河水温暖。人也是这样。每一个人都具有各种人性的胚胎，有时表现这一种人性，有时表现那一种人性。他常常变得面目全非，但其实还是他本人。有些人身上的变化特别厉害。聂赫留朵夫就是这一类人。这种变化，有的出于生理原因，有的出于精神原因。聂赫留朵夫现在就处在这样的变化之中。\\n\\n 在法庭审判以后，在第一次探望卡秋莎以后，他体会到一种获得新生的庄严而欢乐的心情。如今这种心情已一去不返，代替它的是最近一次会面后产生的恐惧甚至嫌恶她的情绪。他决定不再抛弃她，也没有改变同她结婚的决心，只要她愿意的话，然而现在这件事却使他感到痛苦和烦恼。\\n\\n 在走访玛斯连尼科夫后的第二天，他又坐车到监狱去看她。\\n\\n 典狱长准许他同她会面，但不在办公室，也不在律师办事室，而是在女监探望室里。典狱长虽然心地善良，但这次对待聂赫留朵夫的态度不如上次热情。聂赫留朵夫同玛斯连尼科夫的两次谈话显然产生了不良后果，上级指示典狱长对这个探监人要特别警惕。\\n\\n “见面是可以的，”典狱长说，“只是有关钱的事，请您务必接受我的要求……至于阁下写信提出要把她调到医院里去，那是可以的，医生也同意了。只是她自己不愿意，她说：‘要我去给那些病鬼倒便壶，我才不干呢……’您瞧，公爵，她们那帮人就是这样的，”他补充说。\\n\\n 聂赫留朵夫什么也没回答，只要求让他进去探望。典狱长派一个看守带他去。聂赫留朵夫就跟着他走进一间空荡荡的女监探望室。\\n\\n 玛丝洛娃已经在那里。她从铁栅栏后面走出来，模样文静而羞怯。她走到聂赫留朵夫紧跟前，眼睛不看他，低声说：\\n\\n “请您原谅我，德米特里·伊凡为奇，前天我话说得不好。”\\n\\n “可轮不到我来原谅您……”聂赫留朵夫想说，但没有说下去。\\n\\n “不过您还是离开我的好，”玛丝洛娃补充说，用可怕的目光斜睨了他一眼。聂赫留朵夫在她的眼睛里又看到了紧张而愤恨的神色。\\n\\n “究竟为什么我得离开您呢？”\\n\\n “就该这样。”\\n\\n “为什么就该这样？”\\n\\n 她又用他认为愤恨的目光瞅了瞅他。\\n\\n “嗯，说实在的，”她说。“您还是离开我吧，我对您说的是实话。我受不了。您把您那套想法丢掉吧，”她嘴唇哆嗦地说，接着沉默了一下。“我这是实话。要不我宁可上吊。”\\n\\n 聂赫留朵夫觉得，她这样拒绝，表示她因为他加于她的屈辱恨他，不能饶恕他，但也夹杂着一种美好而重要的因素。她这样平心静气地再次拒绝他，这就立刻消除了聂赫留朵夫心里的种种猜疑，使他恢复了原先那种严肃、庄重和爱怜的心情。\\n\\n “卡秋莎，我原先怎么说，现在还是怎么说，”他特别认真地说。“我求你同我结婚。要是你不愿意，现在不愿意，那么，我继续跟着你，你被发送到哪里，我也跟到哪里。”\\n\\n “那是您的事。我没有别的话要说了，”她说，嘴唇又哆嗦起来。\\n\\n 聂赫留朵夫也不作声，觉得说不下去了。\\n\\n “我现在先到乡下去一下，然后上彼得堡，”他终于镇定下来说。“我将为您的事……为我们的事去奔走。上帝保佑，他们会撤销原判的。”\\n\\n “不撤销也没有关系。我就算不为这事，也该为别的事受这个罪……”玛丝洛娃说，他看见她好容易才忍住眼泪。“那么，您看到明肖夫了吗？”她突然问，以此来掩盖自己的激动。\\n\\n “他们没有犯罪，是吗？”\\n\\n “我想是的。”\\n\\n “那个老太婆可好了，”她说。\\n\\n 聂赫留朵夫把从明肖夫那儿打听到的情况都告诉了她。\\n\\n 他问她还需要什么，她回答说什么也不需要。\\n\\n 他们又沉默了。\\n\\n “哦，至于医院的事，”她忽然用那斜睨的眼睛瞅了他一眼，说，“要是您要我去，那我就去。酒我也不再喝了……”\\n\\n 聂赫留朵夫默默地瞧了瞧她的眼睛。她的眼睛在微笑。\\n\\n “那很好，”他只能说出这样一句话来，说完就同她告别了。\\n\\n “是啊，是啊，她简直换了一个人了，”聂赫留朵夫想。他消除了原来的种种疑虑，产生了一种崭新的感觉，那就是相信爱的力量是不可战胜的。\\n\\n 玛丝洛娃在同聂赫留朵夫见面以后，回到臭气熏天的牢房里，脱下囚袍，坐到铺上，两手支住膝盖。牢房里只有几个人：那个原籍弗拉基米尔省、带着奶娃娃的患痨病女人，明肖夫的老母亲，以及道口工和她的两个孩子。诵经士的女儿昨天诊断有精神病，被送进了医院。其余的女人都洗衣服去了。老太婆躺在铺上睡觉；牢房门开着，几个孩子都在走廊里玩。弗拉基米尔省女人手里抱着孩子，道口工拿着一只袜子，一面手指灵敏地不断编织着，一面走到玛丝洛娃跟前。\\n\\n “嗯，怎么样，见到了？”她们问。\\n\\n 玛丝洛娃没有回答，坐在高高的铺上，晃动着两条够不到地的腿。\\n\\n “你哭什么呀？”道口工说。“千万别灰心。哎，卡秋莎！\\n\\n 说吧！”她两手敏捷地编织着，说。\\n\\n 玛丝洛娃没有回答。\\n\\n “她们都洗衣服去了。据说，今天来了一大批捐献物品。\\n\\n 送来的东西可多了，”弗拉基米尔省女人说。\\n\\n “菲纳什卡！”道口工对着门外叫道。“这淘气鬼不知跑到哪儿去了。”\\n\\n 她说着抽出一根针，把它插在线团和袜子里，来到走廊里。\\n\\n 这时候，走廊里传来一片脚步声和女人说话声。住在这里的女犯都光脚穿着棉鞋，走进牢房，人人手里拿着一个白面包，有的还拿着两个。费多霞立刻走到玛丝洛娃跟前。\\n\\n “怎么样，有什么事不顺心吗？”费多霞问，她那双明亮的浅蓝眼睛亲切地瞧着玛丝洛娃。“瞧，这是给我们当点心吃的，”她说着把白面包放到架子上。\\n\\n “怎么，是不是他变卦了，不想同你结婚了？”柯拉勃列娃问。\\n\\n “不，他没有变卦，是我不愿意，”玛丝洛娃说，“我就这样对他说了。”\\n\\n “瞧你这个傻瓜！”柯拉勃列娃声音沙哑地说。\\n\\n “是啊，既然不能住在一起，结婚还有什么意思呢？”费多霞说。\\n\\n “那你的丈夫不是要跟你一块儿走吗？”道口工说。\\n\\n “那有什么，我们是正式夫妻嘛，”费多霞说。“可他们，不能住在一起，那又何必结婚呢？”\\n\\n “你自己才是傻瓜！‘何必结婚？’要是他娶了她，就会让她过富日子了。”\\n\\n “他说：‘不论你被发送到哪里，我都跟你到哪里，’”玛丝洛娃说：“他去就去，不去就不去。我可不求他。现在他上彼得堡奔走去了。那边的大臣全是他的亲戚，”她继续说，“不过我还是不需要他。”\\n\\n “这个当然！”柯拉勃列娃忽然同意说，一面理着她的袋子，显然在想别的事。“咱们来喝点酒怎么样？”\\n\\n “我不喝了，”玛丝洛娃回答。“你们喝吧。”\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/328/3234.html","bookId":134,"book":{"id":134,"title":"复活 Resurrection","description":"简介： 列夫托尔斯泰（1828-1910），十九世纪俄国对世界文学最有影响的作家。《复活》是他的代表作之一。本书取材于一件真实事件，主要描写男主人公涅赫柳多夫引诱姑妈家女仆马洛斯娃，使她怀孕并被赶出家门。后来，她沦为妓女，因被指控谋财害命而受审判。男主人公以陪审员的...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/328","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM"}}
