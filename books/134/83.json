{"id":3893,"no":83,"title":"Part 2 Chapter 24","content":"MARIETTE TEMPTS NEKHLUDOFF.\n When they left the Senate, Nekhludoff and the advocate walked on together, the advocate having given the driver of his carriage orders to follow them. The advocate told Nekhludoff the story of the chief of a Government department, about whom the Senators had been talking: how the thing was found out, and how the man, who according to law should have been sent to the mines, had been appointed Governor of a town in Siberia. Then he related with particular pleasure how several high-placed persons stole a lot of money collected for the erection of the still unfinished monument which they had passed that morning; also, how the mistress of So-and-so got a lot of money at the Stock Exchange, and how So-and-so agreed with So-and-so to sell him his wife. The advocate began another story about a swindle, and all sorts of crimes committed by persons in high places, who, instead of being in prison, sat on presidential chairs in all sorts of Government institutions. These tales, of which the advocate seemed to have an unending supply, gave him much pleasure, showing as they did, with perfect clearness, that his means of getting money were quite just and innocent compared to the means which the highest officials in Petersburg made use of. The advocate was therefore surprised when Nekhludoff took an isvostchik before hearing the end of the story, said good-bye, and left him. Nekhludoff felt very sad. It was chiefly the rejection of the appeal by the Senate, confirming the senseless torments that the innocent Maslova was enduring, that saddened him, and also the fact that this rejection made it still harder for him to unite his fate with hers. The stories about existing evils, which the advocate recounted with such relish, heightened his sadness, and so did the cold, unkind look that the once sweet-natured, frank, noble Selenin had given him, and which kept recurring to his mind.\n On his return the doorkeeper handed him a note, and said, rather scornfully, that some kind of woman had written it in the hall. It was a note from Shoustova\u0027s mother. She wrote that she had come to thank her daughter\u0027s benefactor and saviour, and to implore him to come to see them on the Vasilievsky, Sth Line, house No. --. This was very necessary because of Vera Doukhova. He need not be afraid that they would weary him with expressions of gratitude. They would not speak their gratitude, but be simply glad to see him. Would he not come next morning, if he could?\n There was another note from Bogotyreff, a former fellow-officer, aide-de-camp to the Emperor, whom Nekhludoff had asked to hand personally to the Emperor his petition on behalf of the sectarians. Bogotyreff wrote, in his large, firm hand, that he would put the petition into the Emperor\u0027s own hands, as he had promised; but that it had occurred to him that it might be better for Nekhludoff first to go and see the person on whom the matter depended.\n After the impressions received during the last few days, Nekhludoff felt perfectly hopeless of getting anything done. The plans he had formed in Moscow seemed now something like the dreams of youth, which are inevitably followed by disillusion when life comes to be faced. Still, being now in Petersburg, he considered it his duty to do all he had intended, and he resolved next day, after consulting Bogotyreff, to act on his advice and see the person on whom the case of the sectarians depended.\n He got out the sectarians\u0027 petition from his portfolio, and began reading it over, when there was a knock at his door, and a footman came in with a message from the Countess Katerina Ivanovna, who asked him to come up and have a cup of tea with her.\n Nekhludoff said he would come at once, and having put the papers back into the portfolio, he went up to his aunt\u0027s. He looked out of a window on his way, and saw Mariette\u0027s pair of bays standing in front of the house, and he suddenly brightened and felt inclined to smile.\n Mariette, with a hat on her head, not in black but with a light dress of many shades, sat with a cup in her hand beside the Countess\u0027s easy chair, prattling about something while her beautiful, laughing eyes glistened. She had said something funny--something indecently funny--just as Nekhludoff entered the room. He knew it by the way she laughed, and by the way the good-natured Countess Katerina Ivanovna\u0027s fat body was shaking with laughter; while Mariette, her smiling mouth slightly drawn to one side, her head a little bent, a peculiarly mischievous expression in her merry, energetic face, sat silently looking at her companion. From a few words which he overheard, Nekhludoff guessed that they were talking of the second piece of Petersburg news, the episode of the Siberian Governor, and that it was in reference to this subject that Mariette had said something so funny that the Countess could not control herself for a long time.\n \"You will kill me,\" she said, coughing.\n After saying \"How d\u0027you do?\" Nekhludoff sat down. He was about to censure Mariette in his mind for her levity when, noticing the serious and even slightly dissatisfied look in his eyes, she suddenly, to please him, changed not only the expression of her face, but also the attitude of her mind; for she felt the wish to please him as soon as she looked at him. She suddenly turned serious, dissatisfied with her life, as if seeking and striving after something; it was not that she pretended, but she really reproduced in herself the very same state of mind that he was in, although it would have been impossible for her to express in words what was the state of Nekhludoff\u0027s mind at that moment.\n She asked him how he had accomplished his tasks. He told her about his failure in the Senate and his meeting Selenin.\n \"Oh, what a pure soul! He is, indeed, a chevalier sans peur et sans reproche. A pure soul!\" said both ladies, using the epithet commonly applied to Selenin in Petersburg society.\n \"What is his wife like?\" Nekhludoff asked.\n \"His wife? Well, I do not wish to judge, but she does not understand him.\"\n \"Is it possible that he, too, was for rejecting the appeal?\" Mariette asked with real sympathy. \"It is dreadful. How sorry I am for her,\" she added with a sigh.\n He frowned, and in order to change the subject began to speak about Shoustova, who had been imprisoned in the fortress and was now set free through the influence of Mariette\u0027s husband. He thanked her for her trouble, and was going on to say how dreadful he thought it, that this woman and the whole of her family had suffered merely, because no one had reminded the authorities about them, but Mariette interrupted him and expressed her own indignation.\n \"Say nothing about it to me,\" she said. \"When my husband told me she could be set free, it was this that struck me, \u0027What was she kept in prison for if she is innocent?\u0027\" She went on expressing what Nekhludoff was about to say.\n \"It is revolting--revolting.\"\n Countess Katerina Ivanovna noticed that Mariette was coquetting with her nephew, and this amused her. \"What do you think?\" she said, when they were silent. \"Supposing you come to Aline\u0027s to-morrow night. Kiesewetter will be there. And you, too,\" she said, turning to Mariette. \"_Il vous a remarque_,\" she went on to her nephew. \"He told me that what you say (I repeated it all to him) is a very good sign, and that you will certainly come to Christ. You must come absolutely. Tell him to, Mariette, and come yourself.\"\n \"Countess, in the first place, I have no right whatever to give any kind of advice to the Prince,\" said Mariette, and gave Nekhludoff a look that somehow established a full comprehension between them of their attitude in relation to the Countess\u0027s words and evangelicalism in general. \"Secondly, I do not much care, you know.\"\n \"Yes, I know you always do things the wrong way round, and according to your own ideas.\"\n \"My own ideas? I have faith like the most simple peasant woman,\" said Mariette with a smile. \"And, thirdly, I am going to the French Theatre to-morrow night.\"\n \"Ah! And have you seen that--What\u0027s her name?\" asked Countess Katerina Ivanovna. Mariette gave the name of a celebrated French actress.\n \"You must go, most decidedly; she is wonderful.\"\n \"Whom am I to see first, ma tante--the actress or the preacher?\" Nekhludoff said with a smile.\n \"Please don\u0027t catch at my words.\"\n \"I should think the preacher first and then the actress, or else the desire for the sermon might vanish altogether,\" said Nekhludoff.\n \"No; better begin with the French Theatre, and do penance afterwards.\"\n \"Now, then, you are not to hold me up for ridicule. The preacher is the preacher and the theatre is the theatre. One need not weep in order to be saved. One must have faith, and then one is sure to be gay.\"\n \"You, ma tante, preach better than any preacher.\"\n \"Do you know what?\" said Mariette. \"Come into my box to-morrow.\"\n \"I am afraid I shall not be able to.\"\n The footman interrupted the conversation by announcing a visitor. It was the secretary of a philanthropic society of which the Countess was president.\n \"Oh, that is the dullest of men. I think I shall receive him out there, and return to you later on. Mariette, give him his tea,\" said the Countess, and left the room, with her quick, wriggling walk.\n Mariette took the glove off her firm, rather flat hand, the fourth finger of which was covered with rings.\n \"Want any?\" she said, taking hold of the silver teapot, under which a spirit lamp was burning, and extending her little finger curiously. Her face looked sad and serious.\n \"It is always terribly painful to me to notice that people whose opinion I value confound me with the position I am placed in.\" She seemed ready to cry as she said these last words. And though these words had no meaning, or at any rate a very indefinite meaning, they seemed to be of exceptional depth, meaning, or goodness to Nekhludoff, so much was he attracted by the look of the bright eyes which accompanied the words of this young, beautiful, and well-dressed woman.\n Nekhludoff looked at her in silence, and could not take his eyes from her face.\n \"You think I do not understand you and all that goes on in you. Why, everybody knows what you are doing. _C\u0027est le secret de polichinelle_. And I am delighted with your work, and think highly of you.\"\n \"Really, there is nothing to be delighted with; and I have done so little as Yet.\"\n \"No matter. I understand your feelings, and I understand her. All right, all right. I will say nothing more about it,\" she said, noticing displeasure on his face. \"But I also understand that after seeing all the suffering and the horror in the prisons,\" Mariette went on, her only desire that of attracting him, and guessing with her woman\u0027s instinct what was dear and important to him, \"you wish to help the sufferers, those who are made to suffer so terribly by other men, and their cruelty and indifference. I understand the willingness to give one\u0027s life, and could give mine in such a cause, but we each have our own fate.\"\n \"Are you, then, dissatisfied with your fate?\"\n \"I?\" she asked, as if struck with surprise that such a question could be put to her. \"I have to be satisfied, and am satisfied. But there is a worm that wakes up--\"\n \"And he must not be allowed to fall asleep again. It is a voice that must he obeyed,\" Nekhludoff said, failing into the trap.\n Many a time later on Nekhludoff remembered with shame his talk with her. He remembered her words, which were not so much lies as imitations of his own, and her face, which seemed looking at him with sympathetic attention when he told her about the terrors of the prison and of his impressions in the country.\n When the Countess returned they were talking not merely like old, but like exclusive friends who alone understood one another. They were talking about the injustice of power, of the sufferings of the unfortunate, the poverty of the people, yet in reality in the midst of the sound of their talk their eyes, gazing at each other, kept asking, \"Can you love me?\" and answering, \"I can,\" and the sex-feeling, taking the most unexpected and brightest forms, drew them to each other. As she was going away she told him that she would always he willing to serve him in any way she could, and asked him to come and see her, if only for a moment, in the theatre next day, as she had a very important thing to tell him about.\n \"Yes, and when shall I see you again?\" she added, with a sigh, carefully drawing the glove over her jewelled hand.\n \"Say you will come.\"\n Nekhludoff promised.\n That night, when Nekhludoff was alone in his room, and lay down after putting out his candle, he could not sleep. He thought of Maslova, of the decision of the Senate, of his resolve to follow her in any case, of his having given up the land. The face of Mariette appeared to him as if in answer to those thoughts--her look, her sigh, her words, \"When shall I see you again?\" and her smile seemed vivid as if he really saw her, and he also smiled. \"Shall I be doing right in going to Siberia? And have I done right in divesting myself of my wealth?\" And the answers to the questions on this Petersburg night, on which the daylight streamed into the window from under the blind, were quite indefinite. All seemed mixed in his head. He recalled his former state of mind, and the former sequence of his thoughts, but they had no longer their former power or validity.\n \"And supposing I have invented all this, and am unable to live it through--supposing I repent of having acted right,\" he thought; and unable to answer he was seized with such anguish and despair as he had long not felt. Unable to free himself from his perplexity, he fell into a heavy sleep, such as he had slept after a heavy loss at cards.\n 聂赫留朵夫同律师一起从枢密院出来，沿着人行道走去。律师吩咐他的马车跟在后面，然后给聂赫留朵夫讲述枢密院里提到的那个局长的事，讲到他怎样被揭发检举，但他非但没有被依法判处苦役，反而被派到西伯利亚去当省长。律师讲完这事的前后经过和全部丑恶内幕，还津津有味地讲了另一件事：有一笔捐款原是用作建造他们今晨乘车经过的一座未完成的纪念碑的，却被几个地位很高的人侵吞了，而那座纪念碑一直没有建成。他又讲到某人的情妇在证券交易所发了几百万横财；某人出卖老婆，由某人买进。此外，律师还讲到政府高级官员怎样营私舞弊，犯下种种罪行，他们非但没有坐牢，而且在机关里仍旧坐着头几把交椅。这类奇闻轶事显然是讲不完的。律师讲得眉飞色舞，因为它们清楚地表明，律师赚钱的手段，同彼得堡高级官员赚钱的手段相比，是完全正当的。因此，当聂赫留朵夫不等听完高级官员犯罪的最后一个故事，就向他告辞，自己雇马车回河滨街姨妈家去时，律师不禁感到很惊讶。\n 聂赫留朵夫心里非常愁闷。他所以愁闷，主要因为枢密院驳回上诉，无辜的玛丝洛娃不得不忍受无谓的苦难；还因为驳回上诉，他要跟她同生死、共患难的决心更难实现。再有，他想起律师津津有味地讲到那些骇人听闻的丑事，以及不住浮现在他面前的谢列宁的眼神——以前是那么坦率、高尚、可爱，如今却变得那么凶恶、冷淡，拒人于千里之外。这一切都使他闷闷不乐。\n 聂赫留朵夫回到家里，看门人交给他一张字条，多少带点鄙夷的神气，说是一个女人在门房里写的。原来这是舒斯托娃的母亲。她写道，她专诚前来向女儿的救命恩人道谢，并恳请他光临瓦西里耶夫岛五马路某号。她还写道，薇拉非常希望他去。还说他不用顾虑，她们决不会用感谢的话来亵渎他的高尚情操。她们不会向他道谢，她们只是想见见他。要是可能的话，希望他明天早晨光临。\n 另一张字条是聂赫留朵夫的旧同事，宫廷侍从武官鲍加狄廖夫写的。聂赫留朵夫曾托他把聂赫留朵夫亲自替教派信徒写的状子呈交皇上。鲍加狄廖夫用粗大豪放的笔迹写道，他将信守诺言，把状子面呈皇上，但他有个主意，聂赫留朵夫是不是先去找一找经办本案的人，当面托他一下，岂不更好。\n 聂赫留朵夫在彼得堡几天所得的印象，使他灰心丧气，觉得要办成任何一件事都是没有希望的。他在莫斯科拟订的计划，他觉得就象青年时代的梦，一旦踏进生活，就全部破灭。不过既然已来到彼得堡，他认为原定计划还是应该执行，就决定明天先到鲍加狄廖夫家，然后照他的意见去拜访那个能左右教派信徒一案的人。\n 他刚从皮包里取出教派信徒的状子，想重新读一遍，不料察尔斯基伯爵夫人的听差来敲门，请他上楼喝茶。\n 聂赫留朵夫说他马上就去。他把状子放回皮包里，就到姨妈那儿去。上楼的时候，他无意中从窗子里往街上望了一下，看见玛丽爱特那对枣红马，不禁高兴起来，忍不住想笑。\n 玛丽爱特头上戴着帽子，但身上穿的已不是黑色连衣裙，而是一件花哨的浅色连衣裙。她手里拿着一杯茶，坐在伯爵夫人圈椅旁，嘴里尖声尖气地说着什么，那双笑盈盈的美丽眼睛闪闪发亮。聂赫留朵夫进来的时候，玛丽爱特刚说了一句可笑的话，一句不成体统的笑话——聂赫留朵夫从笑声中听得出来，——逗得心地善良、嘴上有毛的察尔斯基伯爵夫人呵呵大笑，她那肥胖的身子都哆嗦起来。玛丽爱特露出特别调皮的神气，微微撇着含笑的嘴，扭过她那张精神饱满、容光焕发的脸，默默地瞧着同她谈话的女主人。\n 聂赫留朵夫从他所听到的几个字中听出，她们在谈当时彼得堡的第二号新闻，也就是关于西伯利亚新省长的轶事。玛丽爱特就是在这件事上讲了一句非常好笑的话，逗得伯爵夫人好久都止不住笑。\n “你要把我笑死了，”她笑得咳嗽起来，说。\n 聂赫留朵夫打过招呼，在她们旁边坐下。他刚要批评玛丽爱特举止轻浮，玛丽爱特已发现他板着脸，有点不高兴。她立刻改变脸色，甚至整个情绪，来讨他的欢心。自从她见到他以后，总是竭力这样做。此刻她忽然变得严肃起来，对自己的生活感到不满，仿佛在寻找什么，追求什么。她这倒不是装出来的，而是确实产生了和聂赫留朵夫同样的心情，虽然她说不出这究竟是一种什么样的心情。\n 她问他的事办得怎么样。他就讲了上诉枢密院失败的经过，还讲到他遇见了谢列宁。\n “啊！一颗多么纯洁的灵魂！真是一个见义勇为的骑士。一颗纯洁的灵魂，”两位太太用了上流社会对谢列宁的惯用外号。\n “他的妻子是个怎样的人？”聂赫留朵夫问。\n “她吗？哦，我不想说她的坏话。但她不了解他。怎么，难道他也主张驳回上诉吗？”玛丽爱特怀着由衷的同情问。\n “这太糟了，我真可怜她！”她叹息着又说了一句。\n 聂赫留朵夫皱起眉头，想改变话题，就谈起那个关在要塞里、经她说情才放出来的舒斯托娃。他向玛丽爱特道谢，感谢她在丈夫面前说了情。接着他想说，这个女人和她的一家只因没有人想到他们而受苦，这件事想起来都可怕，但她不让他把话说完，立刻表示了她的愤慨。\n “您不用对我说这话，”她说。“我丈夫一告诉我她可以放出来，我就大吃一惊。既然她没有罪，为什么要把她关起来呢？”她正好说出了聂赫留朵夫想说的话。“真是岂有此理，岂有此理！”\n 察尔斯基伯爵夫人看到玛丽爱特在同外甥调情，觉得很好玩。\n “你听我说，”伯爵夫人等他们沉默下来，说，“你明天晚上到阿林家去，基泽维特要在她那儿讲道。你也去吧，”她转身对玛丽爱特说。\n “他注意到你了，”她对外甥说。“我把你说的话全告诉他，他说那是好兆头，你一定会走到基督身边的。你一定要去。玛丽爱特，你叫他务必要去。你自己也去。”\n “我呀，伯爵夫人，第一，没有任何权利指挥公爵的行动，”玛丽爱特盯着聂赫留朵夫说，并且用这种目光表示，在对待伯爵夫人的话上，在对待福音派的态度上，他们之间已经有了完全的默契，“第二，您知道，我不太喜欢……”\n “不论什么事你总是顶牛，自作主张。”\n “我怎么自作主张？我象一个乡下女人那样信教，”她笑嘻嘻地说。“第三，”她继续说，“我明天要去看法国戏……”\n “啊！那你看到过那个……哦，她叫什么名字？”察尔斯基伯爵夫人说。\n 玛丽爱特说了那个著名法国女演员的名字。\n “你一定要去看一看，她演得太好了。”\n “那我应该先去看谁呢，我的姨妈，先看女演员，还是先看传教士？”\n “请你别找我的碴儿。”\n “我想还是先看传教士，再看法国女演员的好，要不然就根本没有兴致去听讲道了，”聂赫留朵夫说。\n “不，最好还是先看法国戏，然后再去忏悔，”玛丽爱特说。\n “哼，你们别拿我取笑了。讲道是讲道，做戏是做戏。要拯救自己的灵魂，可不用把脸拉得两尺长，哭个没完。人只要有信仰，心里就快活了。”\n “您哪，我的姨妈，传起教来可不比随便哪个传教士差呢。”\n “我看这样吧，”玛丽爱特笑了笑说，“您明天到我的包厢里来吧。”\n “我怕我去不了……”\n 一个听差进来通报有客来访，把他们的谈话打断了。那是伯爵夫人主持的慈善团体的秘书。\n “哦，那是个很乏味的人。我还是到那边去接待他吧。我回头就来。您给他倒点茶，玛丽爱特，”伯爵夫人说，轻快地向客厅走去。\n 玛丽爱特脱下手套，露出一只强壮扁平、无名指上戴着戒指的手。\n “要茶吗？”她说，拿起酒精灯上的银茶壶，古怪地翘起小手指。\n 她的脸色显得严肃而忧郁。\n “我很尊重人家的意见，可他们总是把我和我所处的地位混为一谈，弄得我心里很不好受。”\n 玛丽爱特说最后几个字时，仿佛要哭出来。她这些话，只要仔细想一想，并没有什么意思，或者说并没有什么特殊意思，但聂赫留朵夫却觉得这些话异常深刻、诚恳和善良。这是因为这位年轻美丽、衣着讲究的女人说这话时，她那双水汪汪的眼睛完全把聂赫留朵夫迷住了。\n 聂赫留朵夫默默地瞧着她，眼睛离不开她的脸。\n “您以为我不了解您，不了解您心里的种种想法。其实您做的事谁都知道。这是公开的秘密。我赞赏您的行为，对您表示钦佩。”\n “说实话，没什么值得赞赏的，我做得还很少。”\n “这没关系。我了解您的心情，也了解她……嗯，好吧，好吧，这事不谈了，”玛丽爱特察觉他脸上不高兴的神色，把话收住。“不过我还了解，您亲眼目睹监狱里的种种苦难，种种可怕的景象，”玛丽爱特说，一心想把他迷住，并且凭她女性的敏感猜出他重视的是什么，“您想帮助那些苦难的人，他们由于人家的冷酷和残忍吃尽了苦，真是吃尽了苦……我了解有人可以为此献出生命，我自己也真愿意这样做。但各人有各人的命……”\n “难道您对您的命不满意吗？”\n “我吗？”玛丽爱特问，仿佛弄不懂人家怎么会提出这样的问题来。“我应该满意，事实上也是满意的。不过我心里有一条虫子在觉醒……”\n “是不应该再让它睡觉了，应该相信它的呼声，”聂赫留朵夫说，把她的花言巧语当作真心话。\n 事后聂赫留朵夫多次想到同她的谈话，感到很羞愧。他想到她那些与其说是虚伪的不如说是有意迎合他的话，还有当他讲到监狱里的种种惨状和乡村的印象时，她那副悲天悯人的脸相。\n 等伯爵夫人回来，他们已谈得十分投机，仿佛老朋友一般。不仅是老朋友，简直是极其知心的朋友。而且在一群不了解他们的人当中，唯独他们俩能相互了解。\n 他们谈到当权者的不公正，谈到不幸的人们的苦难，谈到人民的贫困，但在谈话时眉来眼去，仿佛在问：“你能爱我吗？”对方就回答说：“我能。”异性的魅力通过想象不到的迷人方式把他们相互吸引住了。\n 临走时，玛丽爱特对他说，她永远愿意为他效劳，并要求他明天务必到戏院去找她，哪怕只去一分钟也好，因为她还有一件要紧事要同他谈。\n “那么，什么时候我再能见到您呢？”她叹了一口气，又说。接着小心翼翼地把手套套在戴满戒指的手上。“您说您一定来。”\n 聂赫留朵夫答应了。\n 那天晚上，聂赫留朵夫独自待在房间里。他在床上躺下，灭了蜡烛，可是好久睡不着。他想起玛丝洛娃，想起枢密院的裁决，想起他决心跟她一起走，想起他放弃了土地所有权。突然，仿佛同这些念头作对似的，他的眼前出现了玛丽爱特的脸、她的叹息、她说“什么时候我再能见到您呢”这句话时的眼神以及她的笑容。这些形象是那么清楚，就象他真的看到了她。他不禁笑了。“我要到西伯利亚去，这样好不好呢？\n 我要放弃财产，这样又好不好呢？”他问着自己。\n 在这个明亮的彼得堡之夜，月光从窗帘的隙缝里漏进来，但他对这些问题的回答却是游移不定的。他的头脑里一片混乱。他想唤起原来的心情，继续思索原来那些事情，可是他已无法说服自己了。\n “万一这一切都只是我的胡思乱想，我无法那样生活，我对我的行为感到后悔，那怎么办？”他问自己，却无法回答，心里产生一种好久没有过的烦恼和绝望。他理不清这些问题，却渐渐进入痛苦的梦乡，就象以前赌输了一大笔钱后那样。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/328/3258.html","bookId":134,"book":{"id":134,"title":"复活 Resurrection","description":"简介： 列夫托尔斯泰（1828-1910），十九世纪俄国对世界文学最有影响的作家。《复活》是他的代表作之一。本书取材于一件真实事件，主要描写男主人公涅赫柳多夫引诱姑妈家女仆马洛斯娃，使她怀孕并被赶出家门。后来，她沦为妓女，因被指控谋财害命而受审判。男主人公以陪审员的...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/328","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM"}}
