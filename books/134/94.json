{"id":3904,"no":94,"title":"Part 2 Chapter 35","content":"NOT MEN BUT STRANGE AND TERRIBLE CREATURES?\n The procession was such a long one that the carts with the luggage and the weak started only when those in front were already out of sight. When the last of the carts moved, Nekhludoff got into the trap that stood waiting for him and told the isvostchik to catch up the prisoners in front, so that he could see if he knew any of the men in the gang, and then try and find out Maslova among the women and ask her if she had received the things he sent.\n It was very hot, and a cloud of dust that was raised by a thousand tramping feet stood all the time over the gang that was moving down the middle of the street. The prisoners were walking quickly, and the slow-going isvostchik\u0027s horse was some time in catching them up. Row upon row they passed, those strange and terrible-looking creatures, none of whom Nekhludoff knew.\n On they went, all dressed alike, moving a thousand feet all shod alike, swinging their free arms as if to keep up their spirits. There were so many of them, they all looked so much alike, and they were all placed in such unusual, peculiar circumstances, that they seemed to Nekhludoff to be not men but some sort of strange and terrible creatures. This impression passed when he recognised in the crowd of convicts the murderer Federoff, and among the exiles Okhotin the wit, and another tramp who had appealed to him for assistance. Almost all the prisoners turned and looked at the trap that was passing them and at the gentleman inside. Federoff tossed his head backwards as a sign that he had recognised Nekhludoff, Okhotin winked, but neither of them bowed, considering it not the thing.\n As soon as Nekhludoff came up to the women he saw Maslova; she was in the second row. The first in the row was a short-legged, black-eyed, hideous woman, who had her cloak tucked up in her girdle. This was Koroshavka. The next was a pregnant woman, who dragged herself along with difficulty. The third was Maslova; she was carrying her sack on her shoulder, and looking straight before her. Her face looked calm and determined. The fourth in the row was a young, lovely woman who was walking along briskly, dressed in a short cloak, her kerchief tied in peasant fashion. This was Theodosia.\n Nekhludoff got down and approached the women, meaning to ask Maslova if she had got the things he had sent her, and how she was feeling, but the convoy sergeant, who was walking on that side, noticed him at once, and ran towards him.\n \"You must not do that, sir. It is against the regulations to approach the gang,\" shouted the sergeant as he came up.\n But when he recognised Nekhludoff (every one in the prison knew Nekhludoff) the sergeant raised his fingers to his cap, and, stopping in front of Nekhludoff, said: \"Not now; wait till we get to the railway station; here it is not allowed. Don\u0027t lag behind; march!\" he shouted to the convicts, and putting on a brisk air, he ran back to his place at a trot, in spite of the heat and the elegant new boots on his feet.\n Nekhludoff went on to the pavement and told the isvostchik to follow him; himself walking, so as to keep the convicts in sight. Wherever the gang passed it attracted attention mixed with horror and compassion. Those who drove past leaned out of the vehicles and followed the prisoners with their eyes. Those on foot stopped and looked with fear and surprise at the terrible sight. Some came up and gave alms to the prisoners. The alms were received by the convoy. Some, as if they were hypnotised, followed the gang, but then stopped, shook their heads, and followed the prisoners only with their eyes. Everywhere the people came out of the gates and doors, and called others to come out, too, or leaned out of the windows looking, silent and immovable, at the frightful procession. At a cross-road a fine carriage was stopped by the gang. A fat coachman, with a shiny face and two rows of buttons on his back, sat on the box; a married couple sat facing the horses, the wife, a pale, thin woman, with a light-coloured bonnet on her head and a bright sunshade in her hand, the husband with a top-hat and a well-cut light-coloured overcoat. On the seat in front sat their children--a well-dressed little girl, with loose, fair hair, and as fresh as a flower, who also held a bright parasol, and an eight-year-old boy, with a long, thin neck and sharp collarbones, a sailor hat with long ribbons on his head.\n The father was angrily scolding the coachman because he had not passed in front of the gang when he had a chance, and the mother frowned and half closed her eyes with a look of disgust, shielding herself from the dust and the sun with her silk sunshade, which she held close to her face.\n The fat coachman frowned angrily at the unjust rebukes of his master--who had himself given the order to drive along that street--and with difficulty held in the glossy, black horses, foaming under their harness and impatient to go on.\n The policeman wished with all his soul to please the owner of the fine equipage by stopping the gang, yet felt that the dismal solemnity of the procession could not be broken even for so rich a gentleman. He only raised his fingers to his cap to show his respect for riches, and looked severely at the prisoners as if promising in any case to protect the owners of the carriage from them. So the carriage had to wait till the whole of the procession had passed, and could only move on when the last of the carts, laden with sacks and prisoners, rattled by. The hysterical woman who sat on one of the carts, and had grown calm, again began shrieking and sobbing when she saw the elegant carriage. Then the coachman tightened the reins with a slight touch, and the black trotters, their shoes ringing against the paving stones, drew the carriage, softly swaying on its rubber tires, towards the country house where the husband, the wife, the girl, and the boy with the sharp collar-bones were going to amuse themselves. Neither the father nor the mother gave the girl and boy any explanation of what they had seen, so that the children had themselves to find out the meaning of this curious sight. The girl, taking the expression of her father\u0027s and mother\u0027s faces into consideration, solved the problem by assuming that these people were quite another kind of men and women than her father and mother and their acquaintances, that they were bad people, and that they had therefore to be treated in the manner they were being treated.\n Therefore the girl felt nothing but fear, and was glad when she could no longer see those people.\n But the boy with the long, thin neck, who looked at the procession of prisoners without taking his eyes off them, solved the question differently.\n He still knew, firmly and without any doubt, for he had it from God, that these people were just the same kind of people as he was, and like all other people, and therefore some one had done these people some wrong, something that ought not to have been done, and he was sorry for them, and felt no horror either of those who were shaved and chained or of those who had shaved and chained them. And so the boy\u0027s lips pouted more and more, and he made greater and greater efforts not to cry, thinking it a shame to cry in such a case.\n 队伍非常长，前头的人已经走得看不见了，后面装载行李和老弱病残的大车才刚刚起动。等大车一起动，聂赫留朵夫就坐上马车，吩咐车夫赶上队伍，看看在男犯中间有没有熟人，并在女犯中找到玛丝洛娃，问问她有没有收到送去的东西。天气更热了，空中没有风，上千只脚扬起的灰尘，一直飘浮在街心走着的犯人们头上。犯人们走得很快，聂赫留朵夫的马车驾的不是快马，费了好大工夫才赶到队伍前头。一排又一排模样古怪的可怕生物，迈动上千只穿着同样鞋袜的脚，合着步伐摆动空手，似乎在给自己鼓气。他们人数那么多，模样那么单调，又处在那么古怪的特殊条件下，以致聂赫留朵夫觉得，他们仿佛不是人，而是一种可怕的特种生物。直到他在苦役犯中认出凶手费多罗夫，在流放犯中认出滑稽家伙奥霍京和一个求他帮过忙的流浪汉，才改变了这种印象。犯人几乎个个回过头来，斜视着那辆赶上他们的轻便马车和车上那个不断打量他们的老爷。费多罗夫扬了扬头，表示他认识聂赫留朵夫。奥霍京挤了挤眼。不过他们两人都没有点头，认为这是犯禁的。聂赫留朵夫走到女犯旁边，立刻认出了玛丝洛娃。她在女犯的第二排。这一排边上走着一个女犯，红脸庞，黑眼睛，短腿，模样难看，把囚袍前摆掖在腰里，她就是俏娘们。她旁边是个孕妇，勉强拖着两腿走着。第三个就是玛丝洛娃。玛丝洛娃肩上掮着袋子，眼睛瞧着前方，脸色镇定而坚毅。这一排的第四人是个年轻漂亮的女人，穿一件短袍，象农妇那样扎着头巾，步伐矫健，她就是费多霞。聂赫留朵夫跳下马车，向女犯队伍走去，想问问玛丝洛娃有没有收到东西，她身体怎样，可是在队伍这边走着的一个押解军士一发现有人接近队伍，立刻赶过来。\n “不行，老爷，接近队伍是不允许的，”他走过来，大声说。\n 军士走过来，认出聂赫留朵夫（在监狱里人人都认识聂赫留朵夫），就把手举到帽沿上敬了个礼，在聂赫留朵夫身边站住说：\n “现在不行。到火车站就可以了，这儿是不允许的。别掉队，快走！”他对犯人们吆喝道。接着不顾天气炎热，抖擞精神，迈着穿漂亮新皮靴的脚，快步跑到原来的位子。\n 聂赫留朵夫回到人行道上，吩咐车夫赶着马车跟在他后面，自己就同队伍并排走去。队伍不论走到哪里，都引起人们的注意，大家看到它又是同情又是恐惧。乘车路过的人都从车窗里探出头来，目送着犯人们，直到看不见为止。过路的行人都站住，又惊又惧地瞧着这可怕的景象。有些人走上前去，施舍一点钱。押解兵就把钱收下。有些人象中了催眠术，跟着队伍走去，但走了一阵又站住，摇摇头，只用眼睛送着队伍。人们纷纷从房子里跑出来，互相招呼着，也有人从窗子里探出身来。他们都呆呆地望着这支可怕的队伍，默不作声。在一处十字路口，队伍挡住了一辆豪华的马车。马车驭座上坐着一个满脸油光、屁股肥大的车夫，身穿一件背上有两排钮扣的号衣。马车后座上坐着一对夫妻：妻子消瘦，苍白，戴一顶浅色帽子，打一把色彩鲜艳的阳伞；丈夫戴一顶高礼帽，穿一件讲究的浅色大衣。前座上，面对他们坐着两个孩子：女孩打扮得漂漂亮亮，娇嫩得象朵小花，披着一头浅色头发，也打着一把色彩鲜艳的阳伞；八岁的男孩脖子细长，锁骨突出，戴一顶水手帽，抱着两条长飘带。做父亲的怒气冲冲地责备车夫，怪他没有及时抢在队伍前面穿过马路；做母亲的嫌恶地眯细眼睛，皱起眉头，把绸阳伞放得低低的遮住脸，以挡住阳光和灰尘。大屁股的车夫听着主人不公正的责备，皱起眉头，面带愠色，因为走这条路，正好是主人吩咐的。他费力地勒住那几匹笼头底下和脖子上汗光闪闪、一个劲儿往前冲的黑马。\n 警察一心一意想为豪华的马车的主人效劳，想把犯人拦住，放马车过去，但他发觉这支队伍里有一种阴森肃穆的气氛，不能破坏，即使为了这样一位阔老爷也不能破例。他只把手举到帽沿上敬了个礼，表示他对财富的尊重，然后严厉地瞅着犯人，仿佛决心保护车上的贵客，不让犯人们侵袭。因此这辆豪华的马车也不得不等整个队伍走完，直到最后一辆装载行李和坐在行李上的女犯的大车过去，才继续赶路。在那辆大车上，有一个歇斯底里的女人刚安静下来，一看到这辆豪华的马车，就又尖叫和号哭起来。直到这时，车夫才轻轻抖动一下缰绳，那几匹黑鬃骏马就在马路上迈开步子，拉动那辆微微晃动的橡皮轮马车，蹄声得得地往别墅跑去，把丈夫、妻子、女儿和脖子细长、锁骨突出的男孩一起送到那里去消夏享乐。\n 做父亲的也好，做母亲的也好，都没有向女孩子或者男孩子解释，他们看见的景象是怎么一回事。因此两个孩子只好自己来解答这问题。\n 女孩子察看父母的脸色，这样来解答问题：这批人同她的父母和亲友截然不同，他们都是坏人，因此就该这样对待他们。就因为这个缘故，女孩子只觉得害怕，直到那些人看不见了，她才放下心来。\n 不过，脖子细长的男孩一直盯住犯人的队伍，眼睛一眨也不眨。他对这问题的看法不同。他直接从上帝那里得到启示，坚决相信他们也是人，跟他自己，跟所有的人一样，因此一定有人欺侮他们，对他们做了什么不该做的事。他怜悯他们。他害怕这些戴着镣铐、剃光头发的人，同时也害怕那些硬要他们戴上镣铐、剃光头发的人。就因为这个缘故，男孩的嘴唇才撅得越来越高，他好容易忍住眼泪，因为他认为在这种场合哭是丢脸的。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/328/3269.html","bookId":134,"book":{"id":134,"title":"复活 Resurrection","description":"简介： 列夫托尔斯泰（1828-1910），十九世纪俄国对世界文学最有影响的作家。《复活》是他的代表作之一。本书取材于一件真实事件，主要描写男主人公涅赫柳多夫引诱姑妈家女仆马洛斯娃，使她怀孕并被赶出家门。后来，她沦为妓女，因被指控谋财害命而受审判。男主人公以陪审员的...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/328","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM"}}
