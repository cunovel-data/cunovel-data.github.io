The advocate promised to look into the case, and if it turned out to be as Nekhludoff said he would in all probability undertake the defence free of charge. Then Nekhludoff told him of the 130 men who were kept in prison owing to a mistake. \"On whom did it depend? Whose fault was it?\"\\n\\n The advocate was silent for a moment, evidently anxious to give a correct reply.\\n\\n \"Whose fault is it? No one\u0027s,\" he said, decidedly. \"Ask the Procureur, he\u0027ll say it is the Governor\u0027s; ask the Governor, he\u0027ll say it is the Procureur\u0027s fault. No one is in fault.\"\\n\\n \"I am just going to see the Vice-Governor. I shall tell him.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, that\u0027s quite useless,\" said the advocate, with a smile. \"He is such a--he is not a relation or friend of yours?--such a blockhead, if I may say so, and yet a crafty animal at the same time.\"\\n\\n Nekhludoff remembered what Maslennikoff had said about the advocate, and did not answer, but took leave and went on to Maslennikoff\u0027s. He had to ask Maslennikoff two things: about Maslova\u0027s removal to the prison hospital, and about the 130 passportless men innocently imprisoned. Though it was very hard to petition a man whom he did not respect, and by whose orders men were flogged, yet it was the only means of gaining his end, and he had to go through with it.\\n\\n As he drove up to Maslennikoff\u0027s house Nekhludoff saw a number of different carriages by the front door, and remembered that it was Maslennikoff\u0027s wife\u0027s \"at-home\" day, to which he had been invited. At the moment Nekhludoff drove up there was a carriage in front of the door, and a footman in livery, with a cockade in his hat, was helping a lady down the doorstep. She was holding up her train, and showing her thin ankles, black stockings, and slippered feet. Among the carriages was a closed landau, which he knew to be the Korchagins\u0027.\\n\\n The grey-haired, red-checked coachman took off his hat and bowed in a respectful yet friendly manner to Nekhludoff, as to a gentleman he knew well. Nekhludoff had not had time to inquire for Maslennikoff, when the latter appeared on the carpeted stairs, accompanying a very important guest not only to the first landing but to the bottom of the stairs. This very important visitor, a military man, was speaking in French about a lottery for the benefit of children\u0027s homes that were to be founded in the city, and expressed the opinion that this was a good occupation for the ladies. \"It amuses them, and the money comes.\"\\n\\n _\"Qu\u0027elles s\u0027amusent et que le bon dieu les benisse. M. Nekhludoff!_ How d\u0027you do? How is it one never sees you?\" he greeted Nekhludoff. \"_Allez presenter vos devoirs a Madame._ And the Korchagins are here et Nadine Bukshevden. _Toutes les jolies femmes de la ville,_\" said the important guest, slightly raising his uniformed shoulders as he presented them to his own richly liveried servant to have his military overcoat put on. \"_Au revoir, mon cher._\" And he pressed Maslennikoff\u0027s hand.\\n\\n \"Now, come up; I am so glad,\" said Maslennikoff, grasping Nekhludoff\u0027s hand. In spite of his corpulency Maslennikoff hurried quickly up the stairs. He was in particularly good spirits, owing to the attention paid him by the important personage. Every such attention gave him the same sense of delight as is felt by an affectionate dog when its master pats it, strokes it, or scratches its ears. It wags its tail, cringes, jumps about, presses its ears down, and madly rushes about in a circle. Maslennikoff was ready to do the same. He did not notice the serious expression on Nekhludoff\u0027s face, paid no heed to his words, but pulled him irresistibly towards the drawing-room, so that it was impossible for Nekhludoff not to follow. \"Business after wards. I shall do whatever you want,\" said Meslennikoff, as he drew Nekhludoff through the dancing hall. \"Announce Prince Nekhludoff,\" he said to a footman, without stopping on his way. The footman started off at a trot and passed them.\\n\\n \"_Vous n\u0027avez qu\u0027 a ordonner._ But you must see my wife. As it is, I got it for letting you go without seeing her last time.\"\\n\\n By the time they reached the drawing-room the footman had already announced Nekhludoff, and from between the bonnets and heads that surrounded it the smiling face of Anna Ignatievna, the Vice-Governor\u0027s wife, beamed on Nekhludoff. At the other end of the drawing-room several ladies were seated round the tea-table, and some military men and some civilians stood near them. The clatter of male and female voices went on unceasingly.\\n\\n \"Enfin! you seem to have quite forgotten us. How have we offended?\" With these words, intended to convey an idea of intimacy which had never existed between herself and Nekhludoff, Anna Ignatievna greeted the newcomer.\\n\\n \"You are acquainted?--Madam Tilyaevsky, M. Chernoff. Sit down a bit nearer. Missy _vene donc a notre table on vous apportera votre_ the . . . And you,\" she said, having evidently forgotten his name, to an officer who was talking to Missy, \"do come here. A cup of tea, Prince?\"\\n\\n \"I shall never, never agree with you. It\u0027s quite simple; she did not love,\" a woman\u0027s voice was heard saying.\\n\\n \"But she loved tarts.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, your eternal silly jokes!\" put in, laughingly, another lady resplendent in silks, gold, and jewels.\\n\\n \"C\u0027est excellent these little biscuits, and so light. I think I\u0027ll take another.\"\\n\\n \"Well, are you moving soon?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, this is our last day. That\u0027s why we have come. Yes, it must be lovely in the country; we are having a delightful spring.\"\\n\\n Missy, with her hat on, in a dark-striped dress of some kind that fitted her like a skin, was looking very handsome. She blushed when she saw Nekhludoff.\\n\\n \"And I thought you had left,\" she said to him.\\n\\n \"I am on the point of leaving. Business is keeping me in town, and it is on business I have come here.\"\\n\\n \"Won\u0027t you come to see mamma? She would like to see you,\" she said, and knowing that she was saying what was not true, and that he knew it also, she blushed still more.\\n\\n \"I fear I shall scarcely have time,\" Nekhludoff said gloomily, trying to appear as if he had not noticed her blush. Missy frowned angrily, shrugged her shoulders, and turned towards an elegant officer, who grasped the empty cup she was holding, and knocking his sword against the chairs, manfully carried the cup across to another table.\\n\\n \"You must contribute towards the Home fund.\"\\n\\n \"I am not refusing, but only wish to keep my bounty fresh for the lottery. There I shall let it appear in all its glory.\"\\n\\n \"Well, look out for yourself,\" said a voice, followed by an evidently feigned laugh.\\n\\n Anna Ignatievna was in raptures; her \"at-home\" had turned out a brilliant success. \"Micky tells me you are busying yourself with prison work. I can understand you so well,\" she said to Nekhludoff. \"Micky (she meant her fat husband, Maslennikoff) may have other defects, but you know how kind-hearted he is. All these miserable prisoners are his children. He does not regard them in any other light. _Il est d\u0027une bonte---_\" and she stopped, finding no words to do justice to this bonte of his, and quickly turned to a shrivelled old woman with bows of lilac ribbon all over, who came in just then.\\n\\n Having said as much as was absolutely necessary, and with as little meaning as conventionality required, Nekhludoff rose and went up to Meslennikoff. \"Can you give me a few minutes\u0027 hearing, please?\"\\n\\n \"Oh, yes. Well, what is it?\"\\n\\n \"Let us come in here.\"\\n\\n They entered a small Japanese sitting-room, and sat down by the window.\\n\\n 第二天，聂赫留朵夫去找律师，把明肖夫母子的案件讲给他听，要求他替他们辩护。律师听完聂赫留朵夫的介绍，说要看一看案卷，又说事情要是确实象聂赫留朵夫所说的那样——这是很可能的，——他愿意担任辩护，而且不取分文报酬。聂赫留朵夫顺便给律师讲了那一百三十人冤枉坐牢的事，并问他这事该由谁负责，是谁的过错。律师沉默了一下，显然在考虑怎样作出正确的回答。\\n\\n “是谁的过错吗？谁也没有过错，”他断然说。“您去对检察官说，他会说这是省长的过错。您去对省长说，他会说这是检察官的过错。总之，谁也没有过错。”\\n\\n “我这就去找玛斯连尼科夫，对他说去。”\\n\\n “哼，这没有用，”律师笑嘻嘻地反对说。“那个家伙，是个……他不是你的亲戚或者朋友吧？……他呀，我不客气说一句，是个笨蛋，又是个狡猾的畜生。”\\n\\n 聂赫留朵夫记起玛斯连尼科夫讲过律师的坏话，一言不发，跟他告了别，坐车去找玛斯连尼科夫。\\n\\n 聂赫留朵夫有两件事要求玛斯连尼科夫：一件是把玛丝洛娃调到医院去，一件是解决那一百三十名囚犯因身分证过期而坐牢的事。去向一个他瞧不起的人求情，虽然很难堪，但要达到目的，这是唯一的途径，他只得硬着头皮去做。\\n\\n 聂赫留朵夫乘车来到玛斯连尼科夫家，看见门口停着好几辆马车，有四轮轻便马车，有四轮弹簧马车，有轿车。他这才想起今天正好是玛斯连尼科夫夫人会客的日子，上次玛斯连尼科夫曾邀请他今天来他家。聂赫留朵夫到达这家公馆时，看见门口停着一辆轿车，一个帽子上钉有帽徽、身披短披肩的男仆正扶着一位太太走下台阶，准备上车。她提着长裙的下摆，脚穿便鞋，露出又黑又瘦的脚踝。聂赫留朵夫在停着的一排马车中认出柯察金家扯起篷的四轮马车。头发花白、脸色红润的马车夫毕恭毕敬地摘下帽子，向他这位特别熟识的老爷致意。聂赫留朵夫还没来得及问门房主人在什么地方，玛斯连尼科夫就出现在铺有地毯的楼梯上。他正好送一位贵客出来，因为那人的身分很高，他就不是把他送到梯台上，而是一直送到楼下。这位显要的军界客人一边下楼，一边用法语说市里举办摸彩会，为孤儿院募捐，这是太太小姐们做的一件有意义的事：“她们既可以借此机会玩一番，又可以募捐到钱。”\\n\\n “让她们快活快活，愿上帝保佑她们……啊，聂赫留朵夫，您好！怎么好久没见到您了？”他向聂赫留朵夫招呼说。“您去向女主人问个好吧。柯察金一家也来了。还有纳丁·布克斯海夫登也来了。全市的美人都来了，”他一面说，一面微微耸起他那穿军服的肩膀，让他那个身着金绦制服的跟班替他穿上军大衣。“再见，老兄！”他又握了握玛斯连尼科夫的手。\\n\\n “哦，上去吧，你来我真高兴！”玛斯连尼科夫兴奋地说，挽住聂赫留朵夫的胳膊，尽管他身体肥胖，还是敏捷地把聂赫留朵夫带上楼去。\\n\\n 玛斯连尼科夫所以特别兴奋，原因是那位显要人物对他青眼相看。玛斯连尼科夫在近卫军团供职，本来就接近皇室，经常同皇亲国戚交往，但恶习总是越来越厉害，上司的每次垂青总弄得玛斯连尼科夫心花怒放，得意忘形，就象一只温顺的小狗得到主人拍打、抚摩和搔耳朵那样。它会摇摇尾巴，缩成一团，扭动身子，垂下耳朵，疯疯癫癫地乱转圈子。玛斯连尼科夫此刻正处在这种状态。他根本没有注意聂赫留朵夫脸上严肃的神色，没有听他在说些什么，就硬把他拉到客厅里，聂赫留朵夫无法推辞，只得跟着他去。\\n\\n “正事以后再说。只要你吩咐，我一定统统照办，”玛斯连尼科夫带着聂赫留朵夫穿过客厅说。“去向将军夫人通报一声，聂赫留朵夫公爵来了，”他一面走，一面对仆人说。那仆人就抢到他们前头，跑去通报。“你有事只要吩咐一声就行。但你一定得去看看我的太太。我上次没有带你去，挨过一顿骂了。”\\n\\n 等他们走进客厅，仆人已去通报了。安娜·伊格纳基耶夫娜，这位自称为将军夫人的副省长夫人，这时夹在长沙发周围的许多女帽和脑袋中间，满脸春风地向聂赫留朵夫点头致意。客厅另一头有一张桌子，桌上摆着茶具。有几位太太坐在那里喝茶，旁边站着几个男人，有军人，也有文官。男女喧闹的说话声从那边不断传来。\\n\\n “您到底来了！您为什么不愿意同我们来往啊？我们什么地方得罪您了？”\\n\\n 安娜·伊格纳基耶夫娜用这样的话来迎接客人，表示她同聂赫留朵夫的关系非常亲密，其实根本不是那么一回事。\\n\\n “你们认识吗？认识吗？这位是别利亚夫斯卡雅太太，这位是契尔诺夫。请坐过来一点。\\n\\n “米西，您到我们这一桌来吧。茶会给您送过来的……还有您……”她对那个正在同米西谈话的军官说，显然忘记他的名字了，“请到这儿来。公爵，您用茶吗？”\\n\\n “我说什么也不同意，说什么也不同意！她就是不爱他嘛，”一个女人的声音说。\\n\\n “她只爱油煎包子。”\\n\\n “您老是说无聊的笑话，”另一个头戴高帽、身着绸缎、浑身珠光空气的太太笑着说。\\n\\n “太美了，这种华夫饼干，又薄又松。您再给我们一点。”\\n\\n “怎么样，您快走了吗？”\\n\\n “今天是最后一天了。因此我们特地跑来。”\\n\\n “春光可美啦，现在去乡下真是再好也没有了！”\\n\\n 米西戴着帽子，身上那件深色条纹连衣裙紧裹着她那苗条的腰肢，没有一点皱褶，仿佛她生下来就穿着这样的衣裳，显得十分美丽。她一看见聂赫留朵夫，脸就红了。\\n\\n “我还以为您已经走了呢，”她对他说。\\n\\n “差一点走了，”聂赫留朵夫说。“因为有事耽搁了。我到这儿来也是有事情。”\\n\\n “您去看看妈妈吧。她很想见见您呢，”她嘴里这么说，心里明白这是在撒谎，而且他也懂得这一层，因此她的脸更红了。\\n\\n “恐怕没有工夫了，”聂赫留朵夫冷冷地回答，竭力装作没有发觉她脸红。\\n\\n 米西生气地皱起眉头，耸耸肩膀，转身去同一个风度翩翩的军官周旋。那军官从她手里接过一只空茶杯，精神抖擞地把它放到另一张桌上，弄得身上的军刀不断碰撞圈椅。\\n\\n “您也应该为孤儿院捐点钱哪！”\\n\\n “我又没有拒绝，不过我想到摸彩会上让大家看看，我这人有多慷慨。到那时我一定要大显身手。”\\n\\n “嗨，那您可得记住哇！”接着就发出一阵装腔作势的笑声。\\n\\n 这个会客日过得很热闹，安娜·伊格纳基耶夫娜更是兴高采烈。\\n\\n “小米卡对我说过，您在忙监狱里的事。这一点我是很了解的，”她对聂赫留朵夫说（小米卡就是指她的胖丈夫玛斯连尼科夫）。“小米卡可能有其他缺点，但您要知道，他这人心地真好。他待那些不幸的囚犯就象自己的孩子。他待他们就是这样的。他这人心地真好……”\\n\\n 她停住了，想不出适当的字眼来形容她丈夫的善\\n\\n 良，——事实上，抽打犯人的命令就是他发出的。接着她笑眯眯地招呼一个走进房来的满脸皱纹、头上扎着紫色花结的老太婆。\\n\\n 聂赫留朵夫为了不失礼，照例说了一些客套话，然后起身向玛斯连尼科夫那儿走去。\\n\\n “那么，对不起，你能听我说几句吗？”\\n\\n “哦，当然！你有什么事啊？我们到这儿来吧。”\\n\\n 他们走进一个日本式小书房，在窗边坐下来。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/328/3232.html","bookId":134,"book":{"id":134,"title":"复活 Resurrection","description":"简介： 列夫托尔斯泰（1828-1910），十九世纪俄国对世界文学最有影响的作家。《复活》是他的代表作之一。本书取材于一件真实事件，主要描写男主人公涅赫柳多夫引诱姑妈家女仆马洛斯娃，使她怀孕并被赶出家门。后来，她沦为妓女，因被指控谋财害命而受审判。男主人公以陪审员的...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/328","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM"}}
