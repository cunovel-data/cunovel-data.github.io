The sister told him about the children. She said they were staying with their grandmother (their father\u0027s mother), and, pleased that his dispute with her husband had come to an end, she began telling him how her children played that they were travelling, just as he used to do with his three dolls, one of them a negro and another which he called the French lady.\\n\\n \"Can you really remember it all?\" said Nekhludoff, smiling.\\n\\n \"Yes, and just fancy, they play in the very same way.\"\\n\\n The unpleasant conversation had been brought to an end, and Nathalie was quieter, but she did not care to talk in her husband\u0027s presence of what could be comprehensible only to her brother, so, wishing to start a general conversation, she began talking about the sorrow of Kamenski\u0027s mother at losing her only son, who had fallen in a duel, for this Petersburg topic of the day had now reached Moscow. Rogozhinsky expressed disapproval at the state of things that excluded murder in a duel from the ordinary criminal offences. This remark evoked a rejoinder from Nekhludoff, and a new dispute arose on the subject. Nothing was fully explained, neither of the antagonists expressed all he had in his mind, each keeping to his conviction, which condemned the other. Rogozhinsky felt that Nekhludoff condemned him and despised his activity, and he wished to show him the injustice of his opinions.\\n\\n Nekhludoff, on the other hand, felt provoked by his brother-in-law\u0027s interference in his affairs concerning the land. And knowing in his heart of hearts that his sister, her husband, and their children, as his heirs, had a right to do so, was indignant that this narrow-minded man persisted with calm assurance to regard as just and lawful what Nekhludoff no longer doubted was folly and crime.\\n\\n This man\u0027s arrogance annoyed Nekhludoff.\\n\\n \"What could the law do?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"It could sentence one of the two duellists to the mines like an ordinary murderer.\"\\n\\n Nekhludoff\u0027s hands grew cold.\\n\\n \"Well, and what good would that be?\" he asked, hotly.\\n\\n \"It would be just.\"\\n\\n \"As if justice were the aim of the law,\" said Nekhludoff.\\n\\n \"What else?\"\\n\\n \"The upholding of class interests! I think the law is only an instrument for upholding the existing order of things beneficial to our class.\"\\n\\n \"This is a perfectly new view,\" said Rogozhinsky with a quiet smile; \"the law is generally supposed to have a totally different aim.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, so it has in theory but not in practice, as I have found out. The law aims only at preserving the present state of things, and therefore it persecutes and executes those who stand above the ordinary level and wish to raise it--the so-called political prisoners, as well as those who are below the average--the so-called criminal types.\"\\n\\n \"I do not agree with you. In the first place, I cannot admit that the criminals classed as political are punished because they are above the average. In most cases they are the refuse of society, just as much perverted, though in a different way, as the criminal types whom you consider below the average.\"\\n\\n \"But I happen to know men who are morally far above their judges; all the sectarians are moral, from--\"\\n\\n But Rogozhinsky, a man not accustomed to be interrupted when he spoke, did not listen to Nekhludoff, but went on talking at the same time, thereby irritating him still more.\\n\\n \"Nor can I admit that the object of the law is the upholding of the present state of things. The law aims at reforming--\"\\n\\n \"A nice kind of reform, in a prison!\" Nekhludoff put in.\\n\\n \"Or removing,\" Rogozhinsky went on, persistently, \"the perverted and brutalised persons that threaten society.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s just what it doesn\u0027t do. Society has not the means of doing either the one thing or the other.\"\\n\\n \"How is that? I don\u0027t understand,\" said Rogozhinsky with a forced smile.\\n\\n \"I mean that only two reasonable kinds of punishment exist. Those used in the old days: corporal and capital punishment, which, as human nature gradually softens, come more and more into disuse,\" said Nekhludoff.\\n\\n \"There, now, this is quite new and very strange to hear from your lips.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, it is reasonable to hurt a man so that he should not do in future what he is hurt for doing, and it is also quite reasonable to cut a man\u0027s head off when he is injurious or dangerous to society. These punishments have a reasonable meaning. But what sense is there in locking up in a prison a man perverted by want of occupation and bad example; to place him in a position where he is provided for, where laziness is imposed on him, and where he is in company with the most perverted of men? What reason is there to take a man at public cost (it comes to more than 500 roubles per head) from the Toula to the Irkoatsk government, or from Koursk--\"\\n\\n \"Yes, but all the same, people are afraid of those journeys at public cost, and if it were not for such journeys and the prisons, you and I would not be sitting here as we are.\"\\n\\n \"The prisons cannot insure our safety, because these people do not stay there for ever, but are set free again. On the contrary, in those establishments men are brought to the greatest vice and degradation, so that the danger is increased.\"\\n\\n \"You mean to say that the penitentiary system should be improved.\"\\n\\n \"It cannot he improved. Improved prisons would cost more than all that is being now spent on the people\u0027s education, and would lay a still heavier burden on the people.\"\\n\\n \"The shortcomings of the penitentiary system in nowise invalidate the law itself,\" Rogozhinsky continued again, without heeding his brother-in-law.\\n\\n \"There is no remedy for these shortcomings,\" said Nekhludoff, raising his voice.\\n\\n \"What of that? Shall we therefore go and kill, or, as a certain statesman proposed, go putting out people\u0027s eyes?\" Rogozhinsky remarked.\\n\\n \"Yes; that would be cruel, but it would be effective. What is done now is cruel, and not only ineffective, but so stupid that one cannot understand how people in their senses can take part in so absurd and cruel a business as criminal law.\"\\n\\n \"But I happen to take part in it,\" said Rogozhinsky, growing pale.\\n\\n \"That is your business. But to me it is incomprehensible.\"\\n\\n \"I think there are a good many things incomprehensible to you,\" said Rogozhinsky, with a trembling voice.\\n\\n \"I have seen how one public prosecutor did his very best to get an unfortunate boy condemned, who could have evoked nothing but sympathy in an unperverted mind. I know how another cross-examined a sectarian and put down the reading of the Gospels as a criminal offence; in fact, the whole business of the Law Courts consists in senseless and cruel actions of that sort.\"\\n\\n \"I should not serve if I thought so,\" said Rogozhinsky, rising.\\n\\n Nekhludoff noticed a peculiar glitter under his brother-in-law\u0027s spectacles. \"Can it be tears?\" he thought. And they were really tears of injured pride. Rogozhinsky went up to the window, got out his handkerchief, coughed and rubbed his spectacles, took them off, and wiped his eyes.\\n\\n When he returned to the sofa he lit a cigar, and did not speak any more.\\n\\n Nekhludoff felt pained and ashamed of having offended his brother-in-law and his sister to such a degree, especially as he was going away the next day.\\n\\n He parted with them in confusion, and drove home.\\n\\n \"All I have said may be true--anyhow he did not reply. But it was not said in the right way. How little I must have changed if I could be carried away by ill-feeling to such an extent as to hurt and wound poor Nathalie in such a way!\" he thought.\\n\\n “哦，孩子们好吗？”聂赫留朵夫稍稍平静下来，问姐姐说。\\n\\n 姐姐讲起她的两个孩子，说他们跟奶奶住在一起。她看到弟弟跟丈夫争论结束，很高兴，就讲起她的孩子们怎样玩旅行游戏，就象她弟弟小时候玩两个布娃娃——一个黑人，一个法国女人——那样。\\n\\n “你还记得吗？”聂赫留朵夫笑眯眯地说。\\n\\n “你看，他们的玩法跟你从前一模一样。”\\n\\n 弟弟跟丈夫的不愉快谈话结束了。娜塔丽雅感到放心，但她不愿当着丈夫的面讲只有她弟弟才听得懂的话。为了让大家都能参加谈话，她就讲起那件刚传到此地的彼得堡新闻：卡敏斯基决斗身亡，他母亲失去这个独子悲痛极了。\\n\\n 拉戈任斯基表示不赞成把决斗致死排除在普通刑事罪之外。\\n\\n 他这种说法受到聂赫留朵夫的批驳。于是原来意见分歧的题目重又引起激烈的争论。两人都没有把自己的意见讲清楚，但各人坚持各人的观点，谴责对方的想法。\\n\\n 拉戈任斯基觉得，聂赫留朵夫谴责他，蔑视他的全部工作。他想对聂赫留朵夫指出，他的观点是完全错误的。聂赫留朵夫呢，姑且不谈姐夫干预他土地方面的事而使他恼火（他在内心深处却感到，姐夫、姐姐和他们的孩子，作为他财产的继承人，是有权干预他的事的），他感到愤恨的是，那些显然荒谬和罪恶的事，这个目光短浅的人却自认为是正确和合法的。姐夫这种自以为是的态度激怒了聂赫留朵夫。\\n\\n “那么，这类事法院会怎么处理呢？”聂赫留朵夫问。\\n\\n “法院会判处决斗中的一方服苦役，就象普通的杀人犯那样。”\\n\\n 聂赫留朵夫又双手发凉，他情绪激动地讲起来。\\n\\n “嘿，那又怎么样？”他问。\\n\\n “那就伸张了正义。”\\n\\n “这么说，法院活动的目的就是伸张正义罗，”聂赫留朵夫说。\\n\\n “还有什么别的目的呢？”\\n\\n “维护阶级利益。照我看来，法院只是一种行政工具，用来维护现存的有利于我们阶级的制度罢了。”\\n\\n “这倒是一种全新的观点，”拉戈任斯基若无其事地笑着说。“一般认为法院是另有使命的。”\\n\\n “我看理论上可以这样说，但实际并非如此。法院的唯一宗旨就是维持社会现状，因此它要迫害和处决那些品德高于一般水平并想提高这个水平的人，也就是所谓政治犯，同时又要迫害和处决那些品德低于一般水平的人，也就是所谓犯罪型。”\\n\\n “第一，说政治犯被判刑是因为他们的品德高于一般人，这我不能同意。他们中间的多数都是社会渣滓，跟您认为品德低于一般人的犯罪型同样堕落，虽然表现方式有所不同。”\\n\\n “可是我认得一些人，他们的品德比审判他们的法官不知要高多少倍。那些教派信徒个个都品德高尚，意志坚强……”\\n\\n 不过，拉戈任斯基有个习惯，说话的时候不许别人打岔，因此他不听聂赫留朵夫说，只管自己讲下去。这使聂赫留朵夫更加恼火。\\n\\n “说法院的宗旨在于维持现存制度，这我也不能同意。法院有法院的宗旨，那就是要么改造……”\\n\\n “关在监狱里改造，真是太好了，”聂赫留朵夫插嘴说。\\n\\n “……要么去掉威胁社会生存的道德败坏分子和兽性难驯的家伙，”拉戈任斯基固执地继续说。\\n\\n “问题就在于现在的社会既不能做到这一点，也不能做到那一点。现在的社会是无能为力的。”\\n\\n “这话什么意思？我不明白，”拉戈任斯基勉强装出笑容说。\\n\\n “我想说的是，合理的惩罚其实只有两种：那就是古代常用的体罚和死刑，但随着社会风气的好转，这些刑罚用得越来越少了，”聂赫留朵夫说。\\n\\n “哦，这种话从您嘴里听到真是新鲜得很。”\\n\\n “是啊，把一个人痛打一顿，使他以后不再做挨打的事，这是有道理的；砍掉一个对社会有害的危险分子的脑袋，这也是完全有道理的。这两种惩罚都是有道理的。可是把一个游手好闲、学坏样而堕落的人关进牢里，使他不愁衣食而又被迫无所事事，并且同极端堕落的人相处在一起，这有什么意思呢？还有，为了一点点事情把一个人从图拉省押解到伊尔库次克省，或者从库尔斯克省押解到别的地方，而国家要在每人头上花费五百多卢布①，这又有什么意思？……”\\n\\n --------\\n\\n ①指流放。\\n\\n “不过，说实在的，这种公费旅行人家是害怕的。要是没有这种旅行和监狱，我和您就不可能这样安安稳稳地坐在这里了。”\\n\\n “这种监狱并不能保障我们的安全，因为那些人不是一辈子关在那里，他们会被放出来。结果就正好相反，他们在那种地方变得更加罪恶和堕落，也就是说变得更加危险了。”\\n\\n “您是说，这种惩治制度必须加以改进。”\\n\\n “改进是不可能的。改良监狱花费的钱会超过国民教育的经费。这样就会给人民增加负担。”\\n\\n “不过，即使惩治制度有缺点，也不能因此就废除法院，”\\n\\n 拉戈任斯基又不听内弟的话，继续讲他自己的观点。\\n\\n “那些缺点是无法克服的，”聂赫留朵夫提高嗓门说。\\n\\n “那怎么办？得把人杀掉？还是象一位政府要人所提议的那样，把他们的眼睛挖出来？”拉戈任斯基得意扬扬地笑着说。\\n\\n “是的，这样做残酷是残酷，但还有点效果。可是现在的办法呢，既残酷，又没有效果，而且极其愚蠢，简直使人无法理解，头脑健全的人怎么能参与象刑事法庭那样荒谬而残酷的工作。”\\n\\n “可我就参与了这工作，”拉戈任斯基脸色发白说。\\n\\n “那是您的事。但我不能理解。”\\n\\n “我看您不理解的事多着呢，”拉戈任斯基声音发抖地说。\\n\\n “我在法庭上看到，副检察官怎样千方百计硬把一个男孩治罪，而那个男孩只会引起一切头脑健全的人的同情。我还知道一个检察官审讯教派信徒，竟然认为读福音书是触犯刑法。总而言之，法院的全部活动就在于干这种毫无意义的残酷勾当。”\\n\\n “我要是这样想，就不会干这一行了，”拉戈任斯基说着站起来。\\n\\n 聂赫留朵夫看见姐夫的眼镜底下有一种古怪的亮光。“难道那是眼泪吗？”聂赫留朵夫想。真的，这是屈辱的眼泪。拉戈任斯基走到窗口，掏出手帕，清了清喉咙，动手擦眼镜，然后又擦擦眼睛。他回到沙发旁，点着一支雪茄，不再说什么。聂赫留朵夫看到他把姐夫和姐姐得罪到这个地步，心里感到又难过又羞愧，特别是因为他明天就要动身，从此再也见不到他们了。他窘态毕露地同他们告了别，便回家去了。\\n\\n “我说的话多半是正确的，至少他没有话好反驳我。但我不该用那种态度对他说话。我能这样被邪恶的感情所支配，能这样得罪姐夫，弄得可怜的娜塔丽雅这样伤心，可见我这人改变得很少，”他想。\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/328/3267.html","bookId":134,"book":{"id":134,"title":"复活 Resurrection","description":"简介： 列夫托尔斯泰（1828-1910），十九世纪俄国对世界文学最有影响的作家。《复活》是他的代表作之一。本书取材于一件真实事件，主要描写男主人公涅赫柳多夫引诱姑妈家女仆马洛斯娃，使她怀孕并被赶出家门。后来，她沦为妓女，因被指控谋财害命而受审判。男主人公以陪审员的...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/328","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM"}}
