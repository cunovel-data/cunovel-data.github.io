{"id":3892,"no":82,"title":"Part 2 Chapter 23","content":"THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR.\n When Nekhludoff knew Selenin as a student, he was a good son, a true friend, and for his years an educated man of the world, with much tact; elegant, handsome, and at the same time truthful and honest. He learned well, without much exertion and with no pedantry, receiving gold medals for his essays. He considered the service of mankind, not only in words but in acts, to be the aim of his young life. He saw no other way of being useful to humanity than by serving the State. Therefore, as soon as he had completed his studies, he systematically examined all the activities to which he might devote his life, and decided to enter the Second Department of the Chancellerie, where the laws are drawn up, and he did so. But, in spite of the most scrupulous and exact discharge of the duties demanded of him, this service gave no satisfaction to his desire of being useful, nor could he awake in himself the consciousness that he was doing \"the right thing.\"\n This dissatisfaction was so much increased by the friction with his very small-minded and vain fellow officials that he left the Chancellerie and entered the Senate. It was better there, but the same dissatisfaction still pursued him; he felt it to be very different from what he had expected, and from what ought to be.\n And now that he was in the Senate his relatives obtained for him the post of Gentleman of the Bedchamber, and he had to go in a carriage, dressed in an embroidered uniform and a white linen apron, to thank all sorts of people for having placed him in the position of a lackey. However much he tried he could find no reasonable explanation for the existence of this post, and felt, more than in the Senate, that it was not \"the right thing,\" and yet he could not refuse it for fear of hurting those who felt sure they were giving him much pleasure by this appointment, and because it flattered the lowest part of his nature. It pleased him to see himself in a mirror in his gold-embroidered uniform, and to accept the deference paid him by some people because of his position.\n Something of the same kind happened when he married. A very brilliant match, from a worldly point of view, was arranged for him, and he married chiefly because by refusing he would have had to hurt the young lady who wished to be married to him, and those who arranged the marriage, and also because a marriage with a nice young girl of noble birth flattered his vanity and gave him pleasure. But this marriage very soon proved to be even less \"the right thing\" than the Government service and his position at Court.\n After the birth of her first child the wife decided to have no more, and began leading that luxurious worldly life in which he now had to participate whether he liked or not.\n She was not particularly handsome, and was faithful to him, and she seemed, in spite of all the efforts it cost her, to derive nothing but weariness from the life she led, yet she perseveringly continued to live it, though it was poisoning her husband\u0027s life. And all his efforts to alter this life was shattered, as against a stone wall, by her conviction, which all her friends and relatives supported, that all was as it should be.\n The child, a little girl with bare legs and long golden curls, was a being perfectly foreign to him, chiefly because she was trained quite otherwise than he wished her to be. There sprung up between the husband and wife the usual misunderstanding, without even the wish to understand each other, and then a silent warfare, hidden from outsiders and tempered by decorum. All this made his life at home a burden, and became even less \"the right thing\" than his service and his post.\n But it was above all his attitude towards religion which was not \"the right thing.\" Like every one of his set and his time, by the growth of his reason he broke without the least effort the nets of the religious superstitions in which he was brought up, and did not himself exactly know when it was that he freed himself of them. Being earnest and upright, he did not, during his youth and intimacy with Nekhludoff as a student, conceal his rejection of the State religion. But as years went on and he rose in the service, and especially at the time of the reaction towards conservatism in society, his spiritual freedom stood in his way.\n At home, when his father died, he had to be present at the masses said for his soul, and his mother wished him to go to confession or to communion, and it was in a way expected, by public opinion, but above all, Government service demanded that he should be present at all sorts of services, consecrations, thanksgivings, and the like. Hardly a day passed without some outward religious form having to be observed.\n When present at these services he had to pretend that he believed in something which he did not believe in, and being truthful he could not do this. The alternative was, having made up his mind that all these outward signs were deceitful, to alter his life in such a way that he would not have to be present at such ceremonials. But to do what seemed so simple would have cost a great deal. Besides encountering the perpetual hostility of all those who were near to him, he would have to give up the service and his position, and sacrifice his hopes of being useful to humanity by his service, now and in the future. To make such a sacrifice one would have to be firmly convinced of being right.\n And he was firmly convinced he was right, as no educated man of our time can help being convinced who knows a little history and how the religions, and especially Church Christianity, originated.\n But under the stress of his daily life he, a truthful man, allowed a little falsehood to creep in. He said that in order to do justice to an unreasonable thing one had to study the unreasonable thing. It was a little falsehood, but it sunk him into the big falsehood in which he was now caught.\n Before putting to himself the question whether the orthodoxy in which he was born and bred, and which every one expected him to accept, and without which he could not continue his useful occupation, contained the truth, he had already decided the answer. And to clear up the question he did not read Voltaire, Schopenhauer, Herbert Spencer, or Comte, but the philosophical works of Hegel and the religious works of Vinet and Khomyakoff, and naturally found in them what he wanted, i.e., something like peace of mind and a vindication of that religious teaching in which he was educated, which his reason had long ceased to accept, but without which his whole life was filled with unpleasantness which could all be removed by accepting the teaching.\n And so he adopted all the usual sophistries which go to prove that a single human reason cannot know the truth, that the truth is only revealed to an association of men, and can only be known by revelation, that revelation is kept by the church, etc. And so he managed to be present at prayers, masses for the dead, to confess, make signs of the cross in front of icons, with a quiet mind, without being conscious of the lie, and to continue in the service which gave him the feeling of being useful and some comfort in his joyless family life. Although he believed this, he felt with his entire being that this religion of his, more than all else, was not \"the right thing,\" and that is why his eyes always looked sad.\n And seeing Nekhludoff, whom he had known before all these lies had rooted themselves within him, reminded him of what he then was. It was especially after he had hurried to hint at his religious views that he had most strongly felt all this \"not the right thing,\" and had become painfully sad. Nekhludoff felt it also after the first joy of meeting his old friend had passed, and therefore, though they promised each other to meet, they did not take any steps towards an interview, and did not again see each other during this stay of Nekhludoff\u0027s in Petersburg.\n 谢列宁在大学读书的时候，聂赫留朵夫就认识他了。当时他是个优秀子弟，忠实朋友，上流社会里教养有素的青年，待人接物很有分寸，而且相貌俊美，风度翩翩，又异常正直诚恳。他并不特别用功，也没有丝毫书生气，但书读得很好，所写的论文几次得到过金质奖章。\n 他不仅在口头上，而且在实际行动上把为人们服务作为生活目标。他认为要为人们服务没有其他途径，只能进政府机关工作，因此一毕业，就把凡是能贡献力量的工作作了一次系统研究，断定到立法办公厅二处工作最有益，就进了那个机关。然而，尽管他兢兢业业，忠于职守，他却觉得这种工作并不能满足他有益于人们的愿望，也不觉得这样做就是尽了本份。由于他同浅薄庸俗的顶头上司发生冲突，这种不满足的感觉就更加强烈，结果他离开了二处，调到枢密院来。他到了枢密院，觉得好一点，但不满足的感觉还是经常使他苦恼。\n 他时刻感到，一切都和他的期望截然相反，一切都和应有的情况截然相反。在枢密院任职期间，他的亲戚为他奔走，替他谋得宫中侍从的职务。于是他只好穿上绣花制服，戴上白麻布胸衬，坐车一家家登门道谢，因为他们让他当上了听差。他左思右想，也不能解释这种差事的意义。他觉得这种差事比在政府机关任职更加“不对头”，然而，一方面他又不能拒绝这项委任，否则就会惹怒那些热心帮他忙的人。另一方面，这项委任又迎合他的劣根性。他在镜子里看到自己身穿金绦制服，人家见到他肃然起敬，又感到沾沾自喜。\n 在婚姻问题上他也遇到同样情况。人家为他撮合了从上流社会看来很美满的婚姻。他所以结婚，主要因为如果拒绝这门亲事，他就会得罪和伤害希望它成功的新娘和撮合的亲戚，同时也因为同这个年轻貌美、门第显贵的姑娘结婚，他的虚荣心得到了满足。不过，这门亲事很快就证实它比机关职务和宫廷差事更加“不对头”。他的妻子生第一个孩子以后，就不愿再生孩子，开始过奢侈的社交生活，而且不管愿意不愿意，他也得参加。她长得并不特别美，但对他是忠实的。不过，姑且不说她这种生活方式严重影响丈夫的生活，就是她自己除了浪费大量精力，换得过分疲劳以外，可以说一无所得。虽然如此，她还是竭力维持这种生活。他千方百计想改变这种生活方式，但她在亲友支持下认为非这样生活不可，结果他的企图就象撞在石墙上一样粉碎了。\n 他们有个女孩，生着长长的金黄鬈发，露着两条白腿。但做父亲的不喜欢她，主要因为她不是按照他的希望培养的。夫妇之间经常发生隔阂，甚至双方都不愿意互相了解，因此一场不动声色、瞒过外人耳目、碍于礼节而保持一定分寸的暗斗就使他的家庭生活变得十分痛苦。这样，他的家庭生活就比机关职务和宫廷差事更加“不对头”。\n 不过，最“不对头”的却是他对宗教的态度。他也象所有同时代和同圈子里的人那样，随着智力的增长，毫不费力就挣脱了他在其中受到熏陶的宗教迷信的枷锁，并且不知在什么时候得到了解脱。他是一个严肃而正直的人，在大学念书、同聂赫留朵夫交往的青年时代，就公然摆脱了官方宗教的迷信。但随着岁月的流逝，官位的步步高升，特别是当时社会上保守反动势力的抬头，这种精神上的自由开始同他的活动发生抵触。且不说家里的情况，尤其是他父亲死后做安魂礼拜，他母亲要他持斋，以及社会舆论对他施加的压力，就是在机关里任职，他也不得不参加祈祷、供奉、谢恩等礼拜，简直难得有一天不接触宗教仪式，而且无法逃避。对这种礼拜，只能两者取其一：要么假装信仰（凭他诚实的天性，这是办不到的），要么认为这些宗教仪式虚伪，竭力避免参加。但为了处理这种似乎无关紧要的问题，却需要做大量工作。除了必须同周围的人经常斗争外，还得完全改变他的地位，放弃公职，牺牲他自以为通过现在职务给人们带来的利益，以及今后将会给人们带来的更多利益。为了要这样做，必须坚信自己的观点是正确的。他有这样的信心，就象当代一切受过教育的人，只要稍微知道一点历史，知道宗教的起源，知道基督教的起源和分裂，就不能不相信这种观点是正确的。他不承认教会宣扬的教义是真理，这一点也是完全正确的。\n 不过，在生活环境的逼迫下，他这个诚实的人只好自己欺骗一下自己。他对自己说，为了证实不合理的事是不合理的，首先就得对这种不合理的事进行研究。这是一点小小的虚伪，但它却把他引向大的虚伪，使他至今不能自拔。\n 他是在东正教的氛围下出生和成长的，周围的人全要他信仰东正教，不承认这个教，他就无法继续从事有益于人们的活动。因此，对他自己提出的东正教是不是正确这个问题，他心中早已有了答案。同时为了阐明这个问题，他不读伏尔泰、叔本华、斯宾塞、孔德①的著作，而读黑格尔的哲学和维奈、霍米雅科夫②的宗教论著。自然，他在那些论著里找到了他所需要的东西：精神上的宽慰和对教义的辩护。他从小就受宗教教义的熏陶，可是他的理性早已把它否定了。然而，没有宗教信仰，整个生活就会充满烦恼，而只要承认它，一切烦恼就会烟消云散。此外，他也学会了种种流行的诡辩术，例如个人的智慧无法认识真理，只有人类智慧的总和才能发现真理；认识真理的唯一途径就是神的启示，而神的启示只有教会才能保存，等等。从那时起，他就心安理得地参加祈祷、安魂礼拜、弥撒、守斋，对着圣像画十字，继续在机关任职，并不觉得在自欺欺人。而在机关任职就使他觉得对人有益，并给他缺乏欢乐的家庭生活带来安慰。他自认为信仰东正教，但另一方面，整个身心又空前强烈地感到，这种信仰完全“不对头”。\n --------\n ①伏尔泰（1694—1778）——法国启蒙思想家，叔本华（1788—1860）——德国哲学家，斯宾塞（1820—1903）——英国哲学家，孔德（1798—1857）——法国哲学家。他们在不同程度上否定基督教。\n ②黑格尔（1770—1831）——德国哲学家，维奈——十九世纪瑞士神学家，霍米雅科夫（1804—1860）——俄国斯拉夫派理论家。他们从不同立场承认基督教义。\n 就因为这个缘故，他的眼神总是那么忧郁。也就因为这个缘故，他看见聂赫留朵夫，就想起当年他认识聂赫留朵夫时还没有沾染这种虚伪的习气，他是个怎样的人。尤其是在他急不及待地向聂赫留朵夫暗示了自己的宗教观以后，他空前强烈地感觉到这一切“不对头”，心里十分悲哀。聂赫留朵夫见到这个老朋友，在一阵高兴以后，也有同样的感觉。\n 也就因为这个缘故，他们两人虽然表示再要见面，却没有找机会会晤，结果在聂赫留朵夫逗留彼得堡期间，他们没有再见过面。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/328/3257.html","bookId":134,"book":{"id":134,"title":"复活 Resurrection","description":"简介： 列夫托尔斯泰（1828-1910），十九世纪俄国对世界文学最有影响的作家。《复活》是他的代表作之一。本书取材于一件真实事件，主要描写男主人公涅赫柳多夫引诱姑妈家女仆马洛斯娃，使她怀孕并被赶出家门。后来，她沦为妓女，因被指控谋财害命而受审判。男主人公以陪审员的...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/328","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:19 AM"}}
