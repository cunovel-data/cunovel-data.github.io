{"id":34857,"no":11,"title":"CHAPTER VI","content":"THE RETREAT—AT BAY Hardly were we clear of the village when the Turkish horsemen came sweeping down into the plain, howling ferociously as they galloped here and there. From time to time they made demonstrations of an immediate attack, whereupon Holroyd would call a halt, and order the guns to unlimber; but the moment the enemy saw the six-pounders at \"action rear,\" he retired out of range. Then the gunners limbered up, and we resumed our march. This happened, I think, three or four times. We had not got very far into the plain when we were joined by a detachment of De Rolle\u0027s Regiment, under Major Vogelsang. The major, who as senior officer assumed command, told us that Macleod had ordered him to retire from his position, leaving a strong piquet to cover his retreat, and move obliquely across the plain until he fell in with us. We were then to join forces and wait for further orders. \"Colonel Macleod has ridden off to withdraw the remainder of the force,\" explained Vogelsang, in his broken English. \"The colonel\u0027s intention is to concentrate his force and stand on the defensive until Stewart comes to our aid; but I fear the detachments are so scattered that they will be cut off in detail.\" \"I agree with you, major,\" said Holroyd. \"However, we must await Macleod\u0027s arrival, and if attacked, make the best defence we can.\" We then formed square with Vogelsang\u0027s men, the two field-pieces being placed in the centre, and calmly awaited the arrival of Macleod with the other divisions, or the onslaught of the enemy, whichever should come first. Our combined force numbered about two hundred and fifty bayonets, besides officers and artillerymen. Although the enemy kept up his threatening attitude, we were not seriously attacked; but it was evident, from the sound of heavy firing on both our flanks, that Macleod, and Vogelsang\u0027s party which he had left to cover his retreat, were having a very warm time of it. We became terribly anxious about them, and would have given worlds to know how they fared. Unfortunately we could only hear, not see the fighting; for the country around us was like a sandy sea, broken up, so to speak, into waves, or undulating mounds, not one of which was so sufficiently elevated as to afford a commanding view from its summit over the rest. In a short time the firing in the direction of the spot where we knew Vogelsang\u0027s covering party was battling against terrible odds, began to slacken, then it suddenly ceased. We looked at one another in horror, for no one could doubt that our gallant comrades of De Rolle\u0027s must have been overwhelmed. \"My poor fellows!\" groaned Major Vogelsang, the tears streaming down his rugged cheeks; \"they must have perished to a man. Would that the Highland colonel had permitted me to remain with them!\" Our attention was now attracted by a triumphant shout, and another body of the enemy appeared in sight, racing to join their comrades, \"as if Ould Nick were at their heels,\" as Paddy Cantillon observed. \"Steady, flankers of the 35th!\" cried Holroyd; \"it\u0027s our turn now! Meet them firmly, and, if needs must, let us die like British soldiers for the honour of the old regiment!\" \"Faith, an\u0027 we\u0027re ready to do that, your honour!\" answered Sergeant Finnigan. \"Shure, divil a one of thim howlin\u0027 haythins shall—\" The gallant old fellow never finished the sentence, for at that moment a score of the bolder horsemen charged up to within pistol-shot of the square, and discharged their carbines at us. They, I have no doubt, fired at random, but chance shots often do most harm—one \"bullet found its billet,\" and lodged in the brain of poor Michael Finnigan. A cry of rage burst from our men, for the sergeant was a general favourite in the light company, and several of the younger hands returned the fire without orders, emptying half-a-dozen saddles, and sending the bold Turks scampering back. \"Steady, light company!\" cried Holroyd angrily. \"What are those men thinking about? Our chance is a poor one if you\u0027re going to lose your heads like this! Reload, lads, and don\u0027t fire again without orders.\" \"Good, Captain Holroyd!\" said Major Vogelsang. \"Steadiness is everything! Ha! they are advancing again—down the front ranks!\" Instantly the order was obeyed: down on the knee dropped the front ranks; while the rear ranks came to the \"recover,\" and stood as motionless as if on an inspection parade. We now beheld three separate columns of horsemen, each equal, in point of numbers, to our little force, moving rapidly towards us, one column leading, the others in rear. As they drew nearer, the rear columns edged off to their right and left, sweeping round so as to threaten the right and left faces of our square. Major Vogelsang now ordered the artillery to unlimber, and bring their two guns into action, right and left; the centre sections of the right and left faces being warned to fall back, so as to leave an opening for the guns, as soon as the word was given. On came the enemy until they were within about three hundred yards of the square, when all three columns drew rein, as if to breathe their horses. \"Now is your time, lieutenant!\" said Vogelsang to the artillery officer. \"Fall back the centre sections!\" Quick as lightning our gunners ran up and laid their pieces. \"Fire!\" shouted their officer, and plump went the six-pound shells into the columns on our right and left, bursting well in the centre, and killing or disabling several men and horses. We gave a ringing cheer as the gunners coolly sponged out and reloaded the guns, for our foes were thrown into great confusion, and we all thought they would beat a precipitate retreat. \"The guns are loaded, sir,\" said the artillery subaltern; \"shall I give them another dose before they\u0027re out of range?\" But the words had hardly been spoken, when the Turkish horsemen wheeled round and charged down upon us, with shrill cries of \"La la ha il Allah! Vras! Vras!\"[1] Again the six-pounders were fired; then the centre sections closed up, and the moment the Turks got within musket-range, our standing ranks gave them a rattling volley, which knocked over several of them, including one of their boldest leaders. This warm reception damped their ardour, and once more they retired in confusion. We young hands thought the day was our own, and rent the air with cheers; some of the men even sprang forward as if to start in pursuit of the retreating horsemen; but the stern voice of the veteran major quickly recalled us to our senses. Vogelsang now ordered the gunners to load, \"to the muzzle,\" with grape and canister, and the infantry to drop a running ball into their muskets. \"We will give them a still warmer welcome, my children!\" he exclaimed, with a laugh like the croak of a raven; \"but you must be steady, and not break your ranks.\" Once again the turbaned warriors advanced to the attack, yelling like a pack of fiends. A well-directed volley of double-shotted musketry greeted them, yet they paused not in their wild career. Then the six-pounders opened on the columns attacking our right and left faces, and their salutation no mortal Turk could have withstood. The havoc produced as the grape and canister tore through the serried ranks was fearful, and with a cry of dismay the assailants of the right and left sides of our square galloped off ventre à terre. The third body of the enemy, however, undismayed by the repulse of their comrades, held on their course, and charged right up to the rear face of the square, where we were posted; almost up to our bayonets\u0027 points they rode, and discharged their pistols, and launched their javelins at us, killing and wounding several of our men. For a moment I feared the square would be broken; but our rear rank had reloaded, and a second volley sent the enemy to the right-about. Then we glanced around, and saw that seven or eight of our men had been killed or wounded. \"Our standing ranks gave them a rattling volley.\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3135/86193.html","bookId":889,"book":{"id":889,"title":"Yule Logs","description":"简介： It was a grand success.
