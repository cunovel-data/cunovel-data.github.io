{"id":34854,"no":8,"title":"CHAPTER III","content":"EL HAMET—AN UNWELCOME DUTY—CHARLES HOLROYD SPEAKS HIS MIND—THE BEGINNING OF THE END Before continuing my narrative, I will briefly state the position of El Hamet. From Lake Edko to the Nile is an isthmus about two and a half miles in extent, varying according to the depth of water in the lake. The remains of a deep dry canal with high banks extend from the river nearly two-thirds across the isthmus, the banks commanding the plain on either side; and on the south side of the canal, about half-way across the isthmus, is the village of El Hamet. On the banks of the Nile and at El Hamet are the only regular passes through the banks of the canal. News of the disaster to the company of De Rolle\u0027s Regiment reached General Stewart early on the 20th April, and he immediately despatched a force, under Lieutenant-Colonel Patrick Macleod (commanding the 2nd Battalion 78th[1]), to reinforce Vogelsang. Macleod\u0027s force was composed of a piquet of the 20th Light Dragoons, two guns, two companies of the 35th, and five of the 78th. \"Our gunners hammered away at Rosetta.\" On the afternoon of the 20th April our company was on duty in one of the batteries. Charles Holroyd, Paddy Cantillon, and I were with the company, none of us feeling particularly amiable. Our artillery had been blazing away all day at Rosetta, while we had little or nothing to do except to listen to the eternal \"bang, bang\" of the guns; a sort of music that gets monotonous, especially when one wishes to indulge in \"forty winks.\" \"I\u0027m sick of this business!\" exclaimed Paddy, as we sat with our backs against the parapet. \"Sorra a bit of divarsion do I see in squattin\u0027 on me hams in a damp ditch!\" \"Take things as they come, Paddy,\" rejoined Holroyd, who was discussing a piece of salt junk and a ship\u0027s biscuit. \"Now, I should much prefer to dine off a spatchcock or a devilled kidney, but as I can\u0027t get such luxuries, I—Halloa, Harris! what ill wind blows you here?\" \"An order for you, Holroyd,\" replied Harris, our worthy adjutant, who came hurrying up at this moment. \"The light company has been detailed as an escort for an ammunition column about to start for El Hamet, and the general desires you to deliver this despatch to Colonel Macleod.\" \"But we\u0027re on piquet, my dear fellow,\" expostulated Holroyd, not relishing the idea of a long tramp across the desert. \"Besides, it is not our turn, you know; we only returned from escort duty last night. Where is James\u0027s company?\" \"Turning out to relieve you; he\u0027ll be here in five minutes,\" was the reply. \"Then why not send him to El Hamet?\" asked Holroyd. \"Because the general\u0027s orders are for the light company to go,\" answered the adjutant; \"so I have no choice in the matter.\" \"Very considerate of the general,\" growled my captain; \"however, \u0027needs must, when a certain old gentleman drives\u0027!\" Guided by the adjutant, we marched to the spot where the ammunition column was awaiting us, and in half-an-hour we were on our way across the desert to El Hamet. Every march comes to an end, and it was with a deep sigh of relief that we at length reached El Hamet. Holroyd at once went off to report his arrival and deliver the despatch to Colonel Macleod, while we waited his return, fondly hoping that we should be dismissed to a well-earned rest. We were, however, doomed to disappointment. Our captain soon rejoined us, and I knew at once, by the expression of his face, that he was thoroughly put out. \"Light company,\" said he, in short, sharp tones, \"there\u0027ll be no rest for any of us to-night. Colonel Macleod has desired me to take up a position among the sand-hills in front of El Hamet, and remain there until further orders. You can fall out for a few minutes, and make the best meal you can on what you\u0027ve got in your haversacks. A ration of cooked beef, biscuit, and rum will be issued to each man shortly after daybreak.\" \"Faith, this is a pleasant state of affairs!\" grumbled Cantillon, as we moved away from the company. \"Does Colonel Macleod expect an attack before daybreak?\" I asked. \"I suppose he does,\" Holroyd replied, \"for he said a great deal about the necessity for vigilance; though he neither gave me any idea from what quarter danger is to be chiefly apprehended, nor of his plans in the event of a sudden attack in overwhelming force. I feel sure,\" he went on, \"that Colonel Macleod is wrong in posting us so far in advance of El Hamet, as it will be impossible to keep up communication, except by occasional patrols; thus the company will stand a serious risk of being cut off, and the village, which, I understand, we are supposed to protect, will be placed in jeopardy.\" Rather surprised at these critical remarks, I ventured to remind my captain that Generals Fraser and Stewart thought very highly of Colonel Macleod, and that the 78th Highlanders swore by him. \"True, Tom,\" rejoined Holroyd. \"Macleod\u0027s character as a regimental commander most deservedly stands high, and a braver man there is not in the British army; nevertheless, judging by what I have heard and observed, I don\u0027t think he is the right sort of officer to hold a separate command at an important post. He lacks firmness and promptness of decision, and should an emergency arise, I much doubt if he will be properly prepared to meet it. Anyhow, I intend to use my own judgment in taking up the position assigned to us, and instead of moving the whole company up to the sand-hills, I shall leave Cantillon, with the left subdivision, half-way between them and the village. We shall then have a support to fall back on if hard pressed.\" \"What of the Mamelukes?—have they turned up?\" asked Paddy. \"Not that I know of,\" was the reply. \"The ammunition we escorted is intended for them; but my own impression is that Mohammed Ali will make up his differences with their beys, and if we see them at all it will be as enemies, not allies. Let us rejoin the men; it is time we were moving.\" Leaving Cantillon, with half the company, under a clump of date-trees, Holroyd led the way to the sand-hills, where he posted our men to the best advantage—a sergeant, corporal, and four files being stationed as an outpost on a slight eminence a little to our right front. Having taken up our position, we anxiously waited events, keeping a very sharp look-out.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3135/86190.html","bookId":889,"book":{"id":889,"title":"Yule Logs","description":"简介： It was a grand success.
