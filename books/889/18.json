{"id":34864,"no":18,"title":"CHAPTER III","content":"A week had glided by, and fishing was in full progress below the cliff. Hezz and his people had enclosed a small shoal of mackerel in their seine, and at another time Lance would have been in the thick of the business, revelling in seeing the line of corks drawn in closer and closer till the shoal was dashing about seeking for a way of escape, before the tuck net was brought to bear, and the arrowy wave and ripple-marked fish were ladled out in baskets. Lance had watched the movements of the cutter anxiously while she stayed off the point; but one fine day she had glided away west with all sail set to the light breeze, and the boy breathed more freely. Then the days passed and nothing seemed to happen, except that when Lance went along the high cliffs, climbing from place to place till he settled himself down in some snug rift where he could scan the sea and note what was going on in the cove below, to see if there was any sign of smuggling, he found that his cousin came cautiously along no less than three times, and the boy laughed to himself from his hiding-place. \"He\u0027s watching me to see if I go down and join Hezz. How can any one be such a sneak?\" Lance often mused after this fashion as the days slipped by; but he kept away from the people down by the cliff, in spite of a wistful look or two he caught from Hezz, who came up to the house several times to sell fish. \"No,\" Lance said firmly, \"I haven\u0027t told tales; but I won\u0027t have anything to do with smugglers.\" One fine afternoon soon after dinner Lance saw his cousin go into the study and take down a book, rest his head on his hands, and begin to read. Lance had followed him to propose that they should go inland and have a ramble in the woods, but his cousin\u0027s action checked him. \"It\u0027s of no use,\" he said; \"he wouldn\u0027t come.\" So the lad went off till he reached one of his favourite look-outs, just by a rift overgrown with brambles, where, when the tide was up, the whispering and washing of water could be heard, showing that one of the many caverns and cracks along the bold coast ran in a great way. \"Wish I knew which of them belonged to this,\" he had more than once said; and upon this particular occasion as he seated himself he began listening to the strange whispering sounds. \"I meant to have tried to find this out,\" he said, \"along with Hezz. Why, I did say something about it once, and he only laughed and said it was a land-spring. Well, I can\u0027t get the boat now.\" Somehow the place had a strange fascination for him that day, and after looking about a bit he picked up a piece of mossy granite as big as his head and pitched it among the bramble growth and ferns just where the whispering washing sound could be faintly heard. To his surprise there was the fluttering of wings, and a jackdaw flew out and away. \"Nest there,\" he muttered; but his thoughts were divided by hearing the stone he had pitched down strike heavily, sending up a hollow sound; and directly after it struck again more loudly, and all was still. He was in the act of rising to examine the spot, but he sank down directly, ducking his head behind a great tuft of ragwort. \"Well, he is a sneak,\" he muttered. He sat close, and Alfred passed about twenty yards below, going on cautiously away to the right, and passing out of sight. Lance sighed, rose, and looked away to the west; but there was no sign of his cousin, so he walked back home. The night came on soft and calm, and after sitting reading a bit, and going over some translation ready for the vicar next day, Lance looked up, to see that he was alone, so putting away his books he strolled out on to the big sloping lawn to where he could see the sea; but it looked quite dark and forbidding, and the stars were half hidden by a haze. Still it was very pleasant out there, and after a time he turned to look back at the house with its light or two in the windows of the ground-floor, while everything else looked black, till all at once a little window high up in the centre gable of the old Elizabethan place shone out brightly with a keen steady bluish light which lasted while he could have counted twenty, and then all was blacker than ever. \"Why, it\u0027s a firework,\" said Lance to himself. \"It must be Alf.\" He had hardly thought this when the light shone out again, burned brightly for a time, and once more went out, leaving the boy wondering, till it once again blazed out sharply, and left all blacker than ever. Lance\u0027s mind was just as black and dark, for he could make nothing of it. Alfred was not likely to be letting off fireworks. What could it mean? Coming to the conclusion that his cousin had been amusing himself in some way or another connected with chemistry, he stood thinking for a minute and then went in, to find the object of his thoughts sitting by his aunt\u0027s side talking quietly, while the squire seemed engrossed in a book. \"Well, perhaps you had better,\" said Mrs. Penwith. \"There\u0027s nothing like bed for a bad sick headache.\" The boy sighed, said good-night, and went up to his room. \"He had too long a walk to-day,\" said Mrs. Penwith, \"and the sun upset him. By the way, Lance, your cousin complains about your being given to avoiding him. Do, pray, put aside all sulkiness and be more brotherly.\" \"Why, it is Alf, mother, who never will come out with me.\" \"There, there, say no more about it,\" said Mrs. Penwith gently. \"You know I wish you to be brotherly, so do try.\" Lance felt too much aggrieved to say anything, and sat in moody silence till it was bed-time, when he said \"good-night\" and went to his own room, thinking the while about those lights. There he lay, thinking and listening for above an hour, during which he heard the various sounds in the house of the servants shutting up and going to bed, and soon after his father and mother\u0027s room door closed, and he settled down to go to sleep. He might as well have settled down to keep awake, for he turned and twisted, and got out of bed to drink water, and got in again. Then he turned the pillow and tried that. Next he threw off the quilt because he was too hot. And so on, and so on, till he sat up to try and face the question which haunted his brain: What did those lights in the little upper window mean? \"It\u0027s of no use,\" said the boy at last. \"I shall never go to sleep till I know.\" He sprang out of bed and dressed himself, and then stood thinking. Did he dare go up in the dark to that little room in the roof and see whether he could find out anything? Yes; and while the exaltation of brain was upon him, he softly opened his door, went out into the broad passage, and along it to the end where the little oak staircase led up to the three attic-like places in the three gables, rooms that were only used for lumber and stores. The boy\u0027s heart beat heavily as he went up in his stockings, and twice over when a board cracked he was ready to rush back to his room; but he forced himself into going on, and stood at last at the centre door of the three, feeling that if he hesitated now he should never do it. \"A signal! came the next moment in answer.\" So pushing the door it yielded, and he nearly darted back, for there was a peculiar sulphury smell in the dark room. But Lance had made fireworks in his time, especially blue lights, and the smell was just the same as that, and he no longer felt scared, for the thought flashed across his brain that some one had burned some pieces of blue light there, and if such were the case there would be something on the window-sill on which they had been burned. He stepped boldly in, and there, sure enough, he found what he expected—a little piece of sheet-iron about half the size of a slate. But what for? A signal! came the next moment in answer; and wildly excited now, he stepped back across the room, descended the stairs and went to the door of his cousin\u0027s chamber, tried the door softly, found it yield, and entered. The bed was empty, and quite cold. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3135/86200.html","bookId":889,"book":{"id":889,"title":"Yule Logs","description":"简介： It was a grand success.
