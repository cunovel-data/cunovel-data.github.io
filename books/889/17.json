{"id":34863,"no":17,"title":"CHAPTER II","content":"\"I can\u0027t help it,\" said Lance to himself, after a weary sleepless night; \"I don\u0027t feel as if I could go and tell tales. I\u0027m not sure; and if I was wrong, and these men were punished for what they did not do, I should never be happy again.\" Lance had made up his mind that he would have no more to do with the people down by the cliff, for he felt now that they were not honest. But there was a bitter feeling of disappointment in coming to this resolve; for it had been so pleasant to get away from the refinements of home with its choice cookery, plate, glass, and fine linen, to the boisterous welcome he always had at Old Poltree\u0027s neat cottage. How delicious the baked hake was, and how luscious the conger pie!—though they were as nothing to the split and grilled fish he caught himself; and Hezz\u0027s mother was always ready to cook for the two boys. And now it was all over; but still he might go and climb to the steep edge, from whence he could look down on the whitewashed cottages, the busy harbour, and the boats. This he did, and grew quite excited as he saw that the revenue cutter was lying off the point, a couple of miles out, as if watching the place. \"Poor old Hezz!\" he said to himself bitterly, \"I hope they will not take him.\" Then incongruously enough he smiled as he thought of the boy\u0027s breaking voice. They\u0027d laugh at him if they heard him croak and squeak as he does now, and perhaps let him off because he\u0027s only a boy. But it would be horrible for the other men. \"Why, father\u0027s a magistrate too,\" said the lad suddenly, \"and he\u0027d be with the others who punished them for smuggling if it was found out. Oh, I can\u0027t go and tell what I know! It would be horrid.\" Lance lay there upon the warm cliff for some time thinking, and then he started and looked down, wondering at what was to him quite a marvel. For there, moving slowly, about a hundred feet below him, was his cousin, threading his way amongst the masses of granite tangled with brambles, in a part where there was no path, nothing more than a faint track or two made by the grazing sheep, and it seemed unaccountable. \"What\u0027s he doing there?\" muttered Lance. \"He must be looking for me. Well, let him look. I don\u0027t want him. If I shout to him he\u0027ll only come and begin to preach at me in his pompous way. When I\u0027m in a good temper it only makes me laugh; but I\u0027m in a bad temper now, and if he begins I shall feel as if I must punch his head.\" So Lance lay and watched, making unpleasant remarks the while, all of a derisive nature. He watched till Alfred had disappeared beyond the chaos of rocks which had fallen from above, and at last he strolled back home, forgetting all about his cousin till he took his place at the luncheon-table, and felt surprised to see him there, looking quite cool and as if he had passed the morning reading in the shade. There was another surprise for Lance before he left the table, the squire letting fall the announcement that Captain Barry was going to dine there at six o\u0027clock that evening. \"So you boys will have to put on your best manners.\" \"Who\u0027s Captain Barry, father?\" \"To speak correctly, he is Lieutenant Barry, my boy, and is in command of the revenue cutter lying on and off. They are giving us all a good hunt up, for he tells me that there has been a great deal of smuggling carried on along this coast; but I told him the only smuggling about here is the smuggling of fish.\" Lance felt that the tips of his ears turned hot, and thought that they must be red. He knew that this was the opportunity for telling all he had found out, but somehow the words would not come. The officer was rowed ashore from the cutter that evening, and the squire had walked down to the tiny harbour, with the two boys, to meet him, and find him a frank, pleasant, middle-aged man, who, for some reason, had never been promoted. He shook hands, and Lance turned scarlet, and then glanced shoreward, to see that Hezz was busy turning the clumsy boat half inside the cavern, and that the big trousers and boots were up on the shelf, while the men inside them seemed to be gazing out to sea in search of a coming shoal. The officer was very pleasant and frank during his stay. He chatted with the boys and asked them if they would like to go to sea; but somehow he found Lance dull and glum, and the boy\u0027s father bantered him that night after the visitor had gone back to the cutter. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3135/86199.html","bookId":889,"book":{"id":889,"title":"Yule Logs","description":"简介： It was a grand success.
