{"id":34867,"no":21,"title":"CHAPTER VI","content":"The cliff and the little harbour beneath looked as beautiful as ever; but there was an element of sadness about the place whenever Lance went down to see Hezz, for he was pretty sure to encounter one or other of the sad-faced women busy in some way or another. There was no playtime for Hezz, whose big, open, boyish face had grown old and anxious-looking; but he always had a smile and a look of welcome for Lance whenever he went down, and rushed off to get the boat ready for a fishing trip somewhere or another. But these were not pleasure excursions, for as soon as the boat was pushed off the two lads tugged at the oars or set the sail to run off to some well-known fishing ground, where they worked away in a grim earnest way to get together a good maund of fish, a part of which was always sold up at the \"big house,\" and at a good price too. As for the women, they worked hard in their patches of garden, or went out in couples to bait and lay the lobster pots, or set the trammel nets, sometimes successfully, more often to come back empty; but somehow they managed to live and toil on patiently with a kind of hopeful feeling that one day things would mend. \"Ever see any of the French smugglers now, Hezz?\" said Lance to him one day. The boy\u0027s eyes flashed, and he knit his brows. \"No,\" he said, in a deep growl, for there had been no squeak in his voice since the night of the fight; the last boyish sound broke right away in that struggle, and he seemed to have suddenly developed into a man. \"No,\" he said, \"nor don\u0027t want to. If it hadn\u0027t been for them the old man and Billy and t\u0027others would ha\u0027 been at home, \u0027stead o\u0027 wandering the wide world over.\" \"Have you any idea where they are, Hezz?\" The lad looked at him fiercely. \"Want to get \u0027em took?\" he growled. \"Of course,\" said Lance, smiling. \"Just the sort of thing I should do.\" \"Well, I didn\u0027t know,\" said Hezz. \"Yes, you did,\" cried Lance. \"Want me to kick you for telling a lie?\" \"Well, you\u0027re a young gent, and young gents do such things. Look at your cousin.\" \"Now, just you apologise for what you said, or I\u0027ll pitch into you, Hezz,\" cried Lance. \"Now then: is that the sort of thing I should do if I knew where the old man and the rest were?\" \"No,\" said Hezz, grinning, \"not you.\" \"Then just you apologise at once.\" \"Beg your pardon, grant your grace, wish I may die if I do so any more. That do?\" \"Yes, that\u0027ll do. Now tell me where they are, just to show me you do trust me.\" \"Tell you in a minute, Master Lance,\" cried the lad earnestly, \"but I don\u0027t know a bit. We did hear from a Falmouth boat as some un\u0027 had sin \u0027em up Middlesbro\u0027 way after the herrin\u0027; but that\u0027s all, and p\u0027raps they\u0027re all drownded. I say, I\u0027ll tell you something, though. What d\u0027yer think my old woman said about your mother?\" \"I don\u0027t know. What did she say?\" \"Said she was just a hangel, and she didn\u0027t know what she should ha\u0027 done all through the stormy time if it hadn\u0027t been for her.\" \"Oh, bother! I didn\u0027t want to hear about that,\" said Lance hurriedly. \"But you ought to hear, and so I telled you. I say, what\u0027s gone of your cousin?\" \"Never you mind. What is it to you?\" said Lance roughly. \"You don\u0027t want to see him again.\" \"Nay, I don\u0027t want to see him, Master Lance, \u0027cause I might feel tempted like; and I don\u0027t want to run again\u0027 him, it might make me feel mad.\" \"Ah, well, you won\u0027t feel mad, Hezz, for he is never likely to come back here again. He\u0027s at a big school place, and going to college soon.\" \"Well, I\u0027m glad he isn\u0027t likely to come; not as I should fly out at him, but Billy\u0027s wife right down hates him, and there\u0027s the other women do too, for getting their lads sent away. You see they\u0027ve the little uns to keep; and Billy\u0027s wife says to me, on\u0027y las\u0027 Sunday as we come back along the cliffs from church with the little gal, \u0027Hezz,\u0027 she says, and she burst out crying, \u0027it\u0027s like being a lone widow with her man drowned in a storm, and it\u0027s cruel, cruel hard to bear.\u0027\" \"And what did you say, Hezz?\" \"Nothin\u0027, Master Lance. Couldn\u0027t say nothing. Made me feel choky and as if my voice was goin\u0027 to break agen; so I give her luttle gal a pigaback home, and that seemed to do Billy\u0027s wife good. Hah, I should like to see our old man home agen, for it\u0027s hard work to comfort mother sometimes when I come back without my fish, and she shakes her head at me and says, \u0027Ah, if your father had been here!\u0027\" \"Poor old lady!\" said Lance. \"You see, it\u0027s when she\u0027s hungry, Master Lance. She don\u0027t mean it, \u0027cause she knows well enough there was times and times when the old man come back with an empty maund; but then you see she\u0027d got him, and now it\u0027s no fish and no him nayther.—No, I won\u0027t, Master Lance. I didn\u0027t say all that for you to be givin\u0027 me money agen.\" \"Well, I know that, stupid. It\u0027s my money, and I shall spend it how I like. It isn\u0027t to buy anything for you, but for you to give to the old woman.\" \"Nay, I won\u0027t take it. If you want to give it her, give it yourself. I arn\u0027t a beggar.—Yes, I am, Master Lance—about the hungriest beggar I ever see.\" \"You take that half-crown and give it to Mother Poltree, or I\u0027ll never speak to you again.\" \"No, I won\u0027t. You give it her.\" \"I can\u0027t, Hezz; she makes so much fuss about it, and kisses me, and then cries. Seems to do more harm than good.\" \"I won\u0027t take it,\" growled Hezz, \"but you may shove the gashly thing in my pocket if you like.—Thankye for her, Master Lance; it arn\u0027t for me. And look here, mind, I\u0027ve got it all chalked down in strokes behind my bedroom door, and me and Billy and the old man\u0027ll pay it all back agen some day.\" \"All right, Hezz,\" said Lance merrily. \"You shall; so it\u0027s all so much saved up, and when you do pay it we\u0027ll buy a new boat, regular clinker-built, copper-fastened, and sail and mast.\" \"That we will, Master Lance,\" cried the lad eagerly. \"One as can sail too, so\u0027s we can hold a rope astern and offer to give t\u0027others a tow. I say, think the old man will ever come back?\" \"I hope so, Hezz.\" \"Ay, that\u0027s what I do—hopes. Sent over the sea, I s\u0027pose, if they did.\" \"Oh, don\u0027t talk about it, Hezz!\" cried Lance bitterly. \"Why didn\u0027t they be content with getting a living with the fish?\" Hezz made no reply, but trudged off to the long whitewashed cottage on the cliff, where as Lance watched he saw Mother Poltree come out and Hezz hand her the big silver coin with King George\u0027s head on one side. The result was that the brawny old woman threw her apron over her face, tore it down again and looked down below, caught sight of the giver, and began to descend. But Lance was too quick for her: he took flight and ran below the cliff, scrambling over the rocks, for it was low tide, and had a toilsome climb up a dangerous part so as to get back home. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3135/86203.html","bookId":889,"book":{"id":889,"title":"Yule Logs","description":"简介： It was a grand success.
