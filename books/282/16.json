AN UNWELCOME APPEARANCE.","content":"\"Good-evening, mamma!\" said Stephen, airily, as he stepped over the threshold, and entered the room. \"Good-evening, Stephen,\" said Mrs. Palmer, soberly. Stephen glanced hastily in all directions in search of Paul, and was glad to find no trace of him. \"Where\u0027s sister Grace?\" he inquired. \"She has gone to bed, Stephen. She always goes to bed at eight o\u0027clock.\" \"Has she spent that gold piece yet, that she was too selfish to lend to her poor brother?\" \"That is a matter you can have no interest in, Stephen.\" \"None of my business, eh?\" \"I didn\u0027t say that.\" \"You meant it, all the same. Where\u0027s Paul?\" \"Do you know where he is? Have you come to tell me, Stephen?\" This question was asked with some appearance of anxiety, and Stephen at once jumped to the conclusion that all things had gone as he desired, and Paul[Pg 126] had fallen into the trap which had been prepared for him. \"Why, you don\u0027t mean to say the kid isn\u0027t at home?\" said Stephen, an irrepressible smile lighting up his face. \"Well, that\u0027s a good one. Most likely he\u0027s in the station-house. Ho, ho!\" \"And you laugh at the thought!\" said Mrs. Palmer, indignantly. \"Oh, he ain\u0027t any better than other boys. You think he can\u0027t do anything wrong, but I\u0027ll bet you half a dollar he\u0027s been caught stealing or something.\" \"Wherever Paul is, I am sure he is not in the station-house,\" said Mrs. Palmer, positively. \"Don\u0027t be too sure of that,\" chuckled Stephen. \"He\u0027s a sly one, Paul is. You wouldn\u0027t think butter\u0027d melt in his mouth, but I know him better\u0027n you do.\" \"Paul is a good son and brother, and always has been.\" \"And I suppose I am not,\" sneered Stephen. \"You must question your own conscience on that subject,\" said Mrs. Palmer. \"You are only my step-mother. You don\u0027t expect me to support you and the kids, do you?\" asked Stephen, coarsely. \"No; I only desire that you will let us alone. We[Pg 127] can get on without your help,\" returned the widow, with dignity. \"That is, if Paul remains all right; but you can\u0027t be sure of that. He may slip up any time, and become a boarder at the expense of the State.\" \"If you have come here to slander Paul, you can hardly expect that you will be welcome.\" \"Oh, well, I know that Paul is your idol. He can\u0027t do anything wrong. I shouldn\u0027t wonder if he was in a scrape now.\" \"What kind of a scrape? Don\u0027t leave me in suspense, Stephen.\" Stephen Palmer was not over supplied with brains, and he was foolish enough to fall into the trap, and speak of what he could not be supposed to know. \"I heard a report,\" he said, \"that Paul had been arrested for stealing in the Milwaukee train to-day.\" \"Where did you get your information?\" asked Mrs. Palmer. \"She doesn\u0027t believe it,\" said Stephen to himself. \"Never mind; she may have to before long.\" \"I don\u0027t care to mention where I heard it,\" he answered. \"It is not true.\" \"Perhaps it isn\u0027t; but if that\u0027s the case, why doesn\u0027t he come home?\" \"He may have been detained by business.\" [Pg 128]\"Oh, yes; very important business!\" chuckled Stephen. \"I guess he\u0027ll find it very important and pressing.\" \"Is that what you have come to tell me, Stephen Palmer?\" \"No, not exactly. The fact is, Mrs. Palmer, I am hard up.\" \"I believe you always are.\" \"Right you are. The fact is, I am very unlucky. Nothing seems to go right with me. I have a hard struggle to get along.\" \"There\u0027s one remedy you might find, Stephen,\" said the widow, sternly. \"What is that?\" \"Work.\" \"Work!\" repeated Stephen, angrily. \"And where am I to find work? Haven\u0027t I tried to get something to do everywhere?\" \"I don\u0027t know; but from what I know of you, I presume not. A man who really wants to work won\u0027t go so long without it as you have.\" \"Much you know about it. I tell you everything is crowded. How much money do you think I have got left?\" \"How should I know?\" \"That\u0027s all,\" said Stephen, drawing a quarter from[Pg 129] his vest-pocket and flipping it up in the air. \"Mrs. Palmer, you must help me.\" \"If you are hungry Stephen, though it is a late hour, I will give you something to eat.\" \"Thank you! I don\u0027t want any of your cold victuals,\" sneered the vagabond. \"Then I can do nothing for you.\" \"Yes, you can. Give me the little girl\u0027s gold piece. You needn\u0027t pretend that she has spent it, for I know better.\" \"Whether that is the case or not, I decline to let you have it.\" \"Look here, widow,\" said Stephen, his brow darkening, \"I ain\u0027t going to be trifled with or bluffed off; not this time. When down here before I wasn\u0027t quite myself, and that young puppy, Paul, thought it safe to bully me. Things are different now. I am perfectly sober, and I know what I\u0027m about. So I tell you once more I want that money, and I advise you to get it for me, or else give me as much out of your own pocket.\" \"Surely you are not in earnest, Stephen Palmer. You won\u0027t persist in this unmanly demand?\" \"Then you don\u0027t know me. Paul is not here to defend you now, and I advise you not to make me angry.\" Stephen rose from his seat, and advanced toward[Pg 130] his step-mother with an ugly look on his mean, evil-looking face. Mrs. Palmer started back, and uttered just one word: \"Paul!\" At the call, Paul, who had found it difficult to restrain himself from rushing into the room sooner, sprang through the door, and, his young face flaming with just indignation, confronted his step-brother.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3009/83087.html","bookId":282,"book":{"id":282,"title":"The Train Boy","description":"简介： The four o\u0027clock afternoon train from Milwaukee, bound for Chicago, had just passed Truesdell, when the train boy passed through the cars with a pile of magazines under his arm....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3009","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:29 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:29 AM"}}
