{"id":8593,"no":4,"title":"CHAPTER IV. AN UNWELCOME VISITOR.","content":"Mrs. Palmer herself went to the door and opened it. There entered a thickset young man, of very dark complexion, with an unhealthy color on his bloated cheeks. His dress was disarranged, his hat sat on his head with a rakish slant downward, revealing coarse, unkempt black hair. \"Good-evening, mother,\" said the new-comer, staggering forward and sinking into the rocking-chair usually occupied by the widow herself. \"Good-evening, Stephen,\" said Mrs. Palmer, gravely. \"Evenin\u0027, sister Grace,\" said the intruder, looking about for a glimpse of the little girl, who was staring at him uneasily. The little girl responded reluctantly. \"Where\u0027s Paul?\" he asked next. \"He\u0027s gone out for a short walk.\" \"No matter. I don\u0027t like Paul; he puts on airs. He doesn\u0027t treat me with the respect due to a—hic—older brother.\" [Pg 34] \"Paul\u0027s a good boy,\" said Grace, rather indignantly; for, though timid, she was always ready to rush to the defense of her favorite brother. \"Hey! what\u0027s that? No impudence, little chicken. Don\u0027t you know I\u0027m your brother, and more than twice as old as you?\" Grace was about to reply, but her mother gave her a warning glance. \"You don\u0027t seem very glad to see me,\" said Stephen, scowling. \"You don\u0027t seem very glad to see me,\" said Stephen, scowling. \"I should be more glad to see you if your habits were good, Stephen,\" said Mrs. Palmer, gravely. \"Who says—hic—that my habits ain\u0027t good? Show me the man; that\u0027s all I want. Show him to me, I say. If it\u0027s Paul, I\u0027ll let him know who I am,\" said Stephen, belligerently. \"I don\u0027t need any one to tell me, Stephen. Your appearance is sufficient to show that you have been drinking.\" \"All gentlemen drink, mother. It\u0027s good for the health. I ain\u0027t one of your sneaking \u0027Sons of Temperance.\u0027 I know how to behave, I want you to understand. I\u0027m a gentleman, I am.\" \"Gentlemen don\u0027t stagger when they walk, and talk thick as you do, Stephen.\" \"You needn\u0027t lecture me any more, Mrs. Palmer—don\u0027t you hear?\" said Stephen, becoming irritated. [Pg 35]\"When I come in of an evenin\u0027 to make a neighborly call, you might treat me different. Have you had supper?\" \"Yes.\" \"I haven\u0027t. I haven\u0027t eaten a blessed thing since mornin\u0027.\" \"If you would like, I will get you something, Stephen.\" \"That\u0027s the way to talk, old lady. I \u0027cept—hic—your kind invitation.\" \"My mother isn\u0027t an old lady,\" said Grace, who was as ready to stand up for her mother as for her brother. \"My mother isn\u0027t an old lady!\" repeated Stephen, with drunken gravity. \"What is she, then? She isn\u0027t an old gentleman. Of course not.\" \"Hush, Grace!\" said Mrs. Palmer. \"It\u0027s of no consequence whether I am called an old lady or not. Would you like some tea, Stephen?\" she inquired. \"You haven\u0027t got any whisky in the house, have you, mother?\" \"No; we don\u0027t keep it. Tea will be much better for you.\" In a few minutes a cup of tea, some cold meat, and bread and butter were placed before Stephen, who ate and drank with eager relish. It was true, as he had[Pg 36] said, that he had not broken his fast since morning, though he had drank since then more than was good for him. His meal seemed somewhat to sober him. \"I say, mother,\" he began, pushing back his chair from the table, \"you\u0027re livin\u0027 in luxury, while I\u0027m a poor, miserable fellow without a home.\" \"I am sorry to hear it, Stephen. It is your own fault. You are surely able to earn a comfortable living for yourself.\" \"My health ain\u0027t good, and I can\u0027t get work half the time.\" It seemed very ridiculous to one who observed his strong frame to think of him as being in poor health. \"Your health would be better if you would abstain from drink, Stephen,\" said Mrs. Palmer. \"Oh, hush up! I\u0027ve had enough of that talk. I\u0027m a gen\u0027leman, and I\u0027ll do as I please. Mother, will you do me a favor?\" \"What is it, Stephen?\" \"Lend me five dollars. I\u0027ll pay it back \u0027morrow or next day—honor of a gen\u0027leman.\" Mrs. Palmer surveyed her visitor with some indignation, and answered, sharply: \"Are you not ashamed, Stephen Palmer, to ask such a thing of me?\" [Pg 37]\"Why should I be \u0027shamed?\" \"You, a strong young man, with only yourself to support, ask me, a weak woman, dependent upon a boy for support, to lend you money?\" \"I\u0027ll pay it back \u0027morrow or next day.\" \"You know very well you would do no such thing. You would spend it in a drunken carouse with your disorderly companions. No, Stephen Palmer, I have no money for you, or such as you.\" \"Is that the way you treat a son of yourn?\" \"You are no son of mine. You are my step-son, but your bad conduct troubled your father for years before his death. You have no claim upon me or mine.\" Stephen eyed her with dull anger. Even in his drunken condition he felt the severity of her words. \"I say, Mrs. Palmer, what did you do with my father\u0027s money—the money that ought to have come to me? You cheated me out of it, and you are livin\u0027 in luxury, while I have no home.\" \"You know very well,\" said Mrs. Palmer, disdainfully, \"that your poor father left no property, except the little furniture you see in these poor rooms. He might have been in good circumstances had you not involved him in losses, and reduced him to poverty by your bad courses.\" [Pg 38]\"You\u0027ve got all the money between you—you, and Paul, and Grace,\" persisted Stephen, angrily. \"You know it\u0027s a wicked falsehood, Stephen!\" said Grace, firing up like a kitten at her step-brother\u0027s insulting words. \"You\u0027re a bad man!\" \"Hoity-toity! I\u0027m a bad man, am I, little vixen?\" said Stephen, glowering at her. \"Yes, you are!\" \"Hush, Grace! Little girls should not talk too much!\" said her mother, fearing that Stephen might become dangerously incensed and proceed to violence. Though he was affected by drink, she felt that she could not offer any adequate resistance in such a case. \"If Paul would only come home!\" she said to herself. He was only a boy; still with him in the house she would feel comparatively safe. \"Come, old lady,\" said Stephen, \"I see you want to get rid of me. Give me some money, and I will begone.\" \"I have no money for you, Stephen.\" \"Didn\u0027t Paul bring home some money to-night?\" Paul often handed his mother the money he had earned during the day, and would probably do so before he went to bed, but fortunately, as she considered, he had not yet done so. [Pg 39]\"He brought home money, but he has it in his own pocket,\" she answered. \"Are you sure he didn\u0027t give it to you?\" asked Stephen, suspiciously. \"No, he did not.\" \"Then he ought to. He\u0027s a selfish boy, to—hic—keep it all himself.\" \"He doesn\u0027t keep it himself. He will probably hand it to me before he goes to bed.\" \"Then I\u0027ll come round to-morrow mornin\u0027, and you can give me some.\" \"It will be of no use, Stephen. Paul\u0027s money goes to support the family, and you have no claim upon it.\" \"Haven\u0027t you any money in the house, Mrs. Palmer?\" \"I decline to answer the question, Stephen Palmer. All I can say is, that I have no money for you.\" \"Come, old lady, you\u0027re puttin\u0027 on airs. I won\u0027t have it. Do you hear me? I say I won\u0027t have it!\" and the wretched fellow pounded on the table fiercely with his fist. Just then, most unluckily, Grace started, and let the gold piece, which she had been holding firmly in her hand, fall on the floor. Her brother espied it, and his eyes gleamed with drunken joy. [Pg 40]\"Ho, ho!\" he said. \"Gold pieces rollin\u0027 \u0027round! You\u0027re mighty poor, ain\u0027t you? That\u0027s just what I need.\" He got up from the chair, and approaching Grace, who by this time had picked up the gold, seized her roughly by the arm, and exclaimed: \"Give me that gold piece, young one, or I\u0027ll wring your neck!\" Grace shrank and cowered under his brutal grasp, but still clutched the money, though pale with terror. \"It\u0027s mine!\" she said. \"You sha\u0027n\u0027t have it.\" \"We\u0027ll see!\" said the ruffian, tightening his grasp and shaking her roughly. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3009/83075.html","bookId":282,"book":{"id":282,"title":"The Train Boy","description":"简介： The four o\u0027clock afternoon train from Milwaukee, bound for Chicago, had just passed Truesdell, when the train boy passed through the cars with a pile of magazines under his arm....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3009","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:29 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:29 AM"}}
