{"id":8618,"no":29,"title":"CHAPTER XXIX. THE BOOK-KEEPER\u0027S TRIUMPH.","content":"In less time than was anticipated Mr. Bradford came to the office, his arm being so far well that it no longer gave him any trouble. The book-keeper did not delay long to open his batteries upon Paul. On the second day, our hero being out, Manson began: \"I would like to say a few words to you, Mr. Bradford, about the new boy.\" \"About Paul?\" asked Mr. Bradford, lifting his eyes from the morning paper. \"Yes, sir.\" \"Very well, proceed.\" \"I can\u0027t say I am satisfied with him, sir.\" \"Indeed! What is the matter?\" \"He is not respectful to me.\" \"Indeed!\" \"I may say he is positively impudent at times.\" \"That surprises me. He seems to me very unlikely to be guilty of such offenses.\" [Pg 212]\"I dare say; he is very artful. I presume he is very respectful to you. That is policy.\" \"I should suppose he would consider it politic to be respectful to you also, Mr. Manson.\" \"All the other boys have, but this boy puts on a great many airs. In fact, he is mighty independent. I suppose it is on account of the extremely high wages he receives.\" \"Yes, ten dollars is very high pay for a boy of his age,\" admitted Mr. Bradford. \"Of course he doesn\u0027t earn it. He doesn\u0027t earn half as much.\" \"You may be right. I should not be inclined to pay another boy nearly as much.\" Mr. Manson was sorry to hear this, as, could he obtain the position for Julius at ten dollars a week, his young nephew had agreed to pay him a commission of two dollars a week, which the book-keeper, being fond of money, was not above accepting. \"Have you any other complaints to make about Paul?\" asked Mr. Bradford. \"Doesn\u0027t he attend to his duties?\" \"Fairly well,\" Manson admitted, reluctantly, the fact being that there had never been a boy in the office so efficient as our hero, the ex-train boy. \"Humph! I am glad to hear that.\" [Pg 213]\"Still it is of course disagreeable to have a boy under me who treats me with insolence.\" \"Do I understand, then, that you would prefer to have a change?\" inquired the manufacturer. \"I don\u0027t want to make any trouble, sir,\" said the book-keeper, who could be polite enough to his employer, \"but I should really be glad to have another boy in Paul\u0027s place.\" \"Very well. I have been thinking of making a change myself.\" Manson could hardly believe his ears. He had entertained very small hope of effecting his purpose, and Mr. Bradford\u0027s ready acquiescence in his wishes filled him with delight. \"If I might venture the suggestion,\" he added, encouraged by his success, \"I should be glad if you would give the place to my nephew Julius.\" \"I don\u0027t know how Julius will suit me,\" said Mr. Bradford, \"but I will try him for a week.\" \"At ten dollars a week?\" suggested Mr. Manson. \"At four dollars a week!\" replied the manufacturer, with emphasis. \"That is all boys of his age usually get. There were special reasons why I paid Paul more.\" Manson was disappointed that Julius should be paid only ordinary boys\u0027 wages, but still it was a great[Pg 214] triumph to have Paul discharged, and Julius put in his place. \"Now,\" he said to himself, \"I\u0027ve the whip-hand of the young rascal. I\u0027ll pay him off.\" \"Shall I tell him, sir, when he comes in?\" asked the book-keeper. \"No; I propose to tell him myself. Send him in to me when he gets back from his errand.\" \"Yes, sir, I will,\" promptly responded the book-keeper, resuming his own work with a satisfied smile. Ten minutes later Paul came in from the post office, bringing the afternoon mail. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3009/83100.html","bookId":282,"book":{"id":282,"title":"The Train Boy","description":"简介： The four o\u0027clock afternoon train from Milwaukee, bound for Chicago, had just passed Truesdell, when the train boy passed through the cars with a pile of magazines under his arm....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3009","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:29 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:29 AM"}}
