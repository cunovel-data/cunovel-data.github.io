{"id":8620,"no":31,"title":"CHAPTER XXXI. PAUL AND HIS SUCCESSOR.","content":"About eleven o\u0027clock the next forenoon Paul, after making some necessary arrangements, took his way toward Mr. Bradford\u0027s counting-room. As he turned into State street he encountered Julius, who had already entered upon the duties of his office. Naturally, Julius adopted his uncle\u0027s theory, that Paul had given dissatisfaction and been discharged, and, as he bore no good will to our hero, he was gratified at the thought. \"Hallo!\" he called out, not averse to exulting over his predecessor. \"Good-morning, Julius,\" said Paul, affably. \"I\u0027ve got your place,\" said Julius, not attempting to conceal his satisfaction. \"Yes,\" answered Paul. \"He doesn\u0027t seem to mind it,\" commented Julius to himself. \"I suppose he is too proud to show me how he feels.\" \"What did the old man bounce you for?\" asked Julius, rather curious on the subject. [Pg 223]\"You must ask him,\" said Paul, still pleasantly. \"My uncle always told me you wouldn\u0027t stay,\" said Julius. \"Perhaps he got me turned off,\" suggested Paul. \"I reckon he did. He didn\u0027t like you much.\" \"No; there wasn\u0027t much love lost between us.\" \"Where are you going now?\" \"Round to the office.\" \"What for?\" \"To see Mr. Bradford.\" \"If you want him to take you on again,\" said Julius, rather uneasily, \"you might as well give it up. He won\u0027t do it.\" \"Are you quite sure?\" \"Oh, yes,\" answered Julius, hurriedly; \"my uncle wouldn\u0027t let him do it.\" \"I thought Mr. Bradford was boss, not your uncle,\" Paul ventured to observe. \"He\u0027ll let my uncle choose the office-boy, and of course uncle Emanuel prefers me.\" \"Don\u0027t be alarmed, Julius. I won\u0027t try to deprive you of your place. Still I want to see Mr. Bradford.\" \"Oh, I know what you want,\" said Julius, nodding. \"Suppose you tell me?\" \"You want Mr. Bradford to give you a recommendation, so you can get another place.\" \"You are sharp, Julius,\" said Paul, laughing. [Pg 224]\"It doesn\u0027t take much sharpness to see that.\" \"Where are you going?\" \"To the post-office.\" \"Very well. We may meet in the office. Good-morning.\" \"I don\u0027t understand that boy,\" said Julius to himself. \"Anybody would think he was all right, instead of having lost his place and a salary of ten dollars a week. It\u0027s awful mean of the old man to pay me only four. I\u0027m worth as much as Paul any day.\" Such was the idea of Julius, and he was by no means singular in thinking well of himself. That is rather common among men as well as boys. Paul went on his way and soon reached the office. The book-keeper turned his head as he entered. When his eyes rested on Paul he frowned. \"You back again?\" he said. \"I am back again, Mr. Manson,\" replied Paul, composedly. \"What do you want?\" asked Manson, rudely. \"My business is not with you, but with Mr. Bradford,\" answered Paul, coldly. \"It appears to me you have no business whatever in this office after being discharged,\" continued Manson. \"It is plain Mr. Bradford doesn\u0027t tell you all his affairs,\" said Paul. [Pg 225]\"What do you mean by that?\" \"I am still in Mr. Bradford\u0027s employ, though not as office-boy.\" \"Is this true?\" asked Manson, in a tone of unpleasant surprise. \"Yes, sir. I am here now by Mr. Bradford\u0027s appointment.\" The book-keeper\u0027s countenance fell. Where now was his triumph? As the post of office-boy was the lowest in the establishment, it was clear Paul had been promoted, and the book-keeper would no longer have the satisfaction of ordering him about or giving him annoyance. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3009/83102.html","bookId":282,"book":{"id":282,"title":"The Train Boy","description":"简介： The four o\u0027clock afternoon train from Milwaukee, bound for Chicago, had just passed Truesdell, when the train boy passed through the cars with a pile of magazines under his arm....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3009","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:29 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:29 AM"}}
