{"id":8614,"no":25,"title":"CHAPTER XXV. PAUL CHANGES HIS BUSINESS.","content":"The shooting of the train-wrecker for the moment diverted notice from the victims of the catastrophe; but their condition speedily recalled the attention of those who were unhurt. Paul once more bent over Mr. Bradford, and repeated his inquiry: \"Are you much hurt, Mr. Bradford?\" \"I can\u0027t tell you. I will try to get up, if you will help me.\" With some difficulty, for the manufacturer was a heavy man, Paul raised him to a sitting position. \"Oh, my arm!\" cried Mr. Bradford, wincing. Paul noticed that his left arm hung helpless at his side. \"I must have broken my arm,\" he said; \"I can\u0027t raise it.\" \"I am very sorry,\" said Paul, his voice showing that he was sincere. \"It is not a time for regret, since I have escaped a more serious peril. I feel that I am fortunate in comparison[Pg 183] with some of these poor people. Never mind me, Paul; go and see whom you can help.\" Paul did as he was directed, and rendered effectual assistance. I am sure my readers will not wish me to go into details, but prefer that I should confine myself to what has direct bearing upon Paul and his fortunes. When Paul found time he came again to Mr. Bradford\u0027s side. \"Paul,\" he said, \"have you heard whether a train has been sent for to carry us to the city?\" \"Yes, Mr. Bradford. One will be here in half an hour.\" \"I am afraid of taking cold in my arm. Is there a house near by?\" The farmer already introduced overheard the question, and said: \"Yes, sir, my house is near at hand.\" \"My good friend,\" said the manufacturer, \"can you arrange to keep me over night? I fear I may take cold here, and my arm is already feeling stiff. Of course I will see you compensated for your trouble.\" \"Whether you do or not, you are welcome to stay at my house.\" \"Paul, I want you to stay with me if you will,\" said Mr. Bradford. \"We will telegraph to both of[Pg 184] our families that we are safe, so that the news of the accident need not terrify them.\" \"Yes, sir, I shall be glad to stay with you, if I can let mother know that no harm has befallen me.\" \"Is there a telegraph office near?\" \"At the next station, only a quarter of a mile distant.\" \"Then after you have seen about my removal, will you telegraph for me?\" \"Certainly, sir.\" \"Have you money with you?\" \"Yes, sir, plenty for that purpose.\" \"Very well. Keep an account of what you spend, and I will repay you. Charge me with the expense of both telegrams.\" \"Thank you, sir.\" Paul attended to his errand, and in half an hour Mrs. Palmer received the following message: \"An accident has happened, but I am safe. I shall not return to-night. Am taking care of a gentleman who is hurt. \"Paul.\" Fortunately this was the first intelligence Paul\u0027s mother received of the railroad disaster, so that she had no time to feel frightened. Had she heard the boys crying the extra containing an account of the accident, she would have been in terrible suspense. [Pg 185]\"Heaven be thanked,\" she ejaculated, devoutly, \"that my boy has been preserved!\" She sent out Grace to buy an extra as soon as it appeared, and shuddered as she read the terrible details. Stephen, too, read the paper, but he could not tell whether Paul was hurt, for no list of names was as yet transmitted. \"Why, that\u0027s Paul\u0027s train!\" he soliloquized. \"Ten to one he\u0027s killed or wounded. I don\u0027t want him killed, but if he\u0027s only broken a limb, it may teach him a lesson.\" What the lesson was, Stephen did not specify, and it might have been hard to say why his young brother needed a lesson, unless it had been criminal in him to work diligently to support his mother and sister. He had declined to contribute to the support of an able-bodied brother, and my readers may be inclined to think with me that he was quite justified in that. Stephen bought a later edition of the paper, and eagerly scanned the list of casualties. \"I don\u0027t see his name,\" he muttered. \"Well, he always was lucky, while I had all the bad luck. Humph! things don\u0027t seem to be distributed very equally in this world. However, I\u0027m getting along pretty well now,\" Stephen concluded, complacently. [Pg 186]Meanwhile Paul, as well as Mr. Bradford, was installed in the best bedroom at the farm-house. A local doctor set the arm, and Paul lay on a lounge, ready to answer any calls. He was prompt and attentive, and Mr. Bradford congratulated himself on having secured so attentive a nurse. \"Paul,\" said Mr. Bradford the next morning, \"you have been of great service to me.\" \"I am glad I have been able to, sir,\" answered Paul. \"You are a good boy.\" \"Thank you, sir.\" \"How much did you tell me you earned on the train?\" \"Seldom less than seven dollars. One week I made as high as ten.\" \"How old are you?\" \"Sixteen.\" \"That is very good pay for a boy of your age.\" \"Yes, sir; I don\u0027t know any other employment that would give me as much.\" \"But of course you must give it up sooner or later.\" \"I thought of that, sir.\" \"Will you be sorry?\" \"Only because when I take a position elsewhere I must make up my mind to earn considerably less, and[Pg 187] I can\u0027t see my way clear to do it while my mother and sister are so dependent upon me.\" \"I suppose you know that I am a rich man?\" \"Yes, sir, I have always heard so,\" answered Paul, not quite understanding why Mr. Bradford should say it. \"I have always held that a rich man owes a debt to the world, and should try to liquidate it by doing all the good in his power.\" \"I am afraid all rich men don\u0027t feel so,\" said Paul. \"No; riches are apt to harden the heart, while they should soften it. I am glad to think that there are many who feel with me. But to return to your prospects. I infer that if you were offered a position paying you as well as this train service you would accept it. Am I right?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"How much do you make on an average?\" \"Daily or weekly, sir?\" \"Weekly.\" Paul considered a moment, and answered: \"Eight dollars.\" \"Very good; then I will give you a chance to better yourself. I will take you into my employ, dating from yesterday.\" [Pg 188]\"And give me eight dollars a week?\" asked Paul, eagerly. \"Ten dollars. I want you to better yourself, you know.\" \"You are very kind, sir,\" said Paul, gratefully, \"but I am afraid I can\u0027t earn as much as that.\" \"Possibly not. Few boys of your age are worth as much. But you rendered me yesterday a great service. You saved me from robbery. How much now do you think my wallet contained?\" \"A hundred dollars,\" guessed Paul, to whom that seemed a considerable sum for a man to carry about. \"Over two thousand!\" answered Mr. Bradford, quietly. Paul\u0027s face showed the amazement he felt. \"Isn\u0027t it imprudent to carry round so much?\" he suggested. \"I had the amount paid me in Milwaukee, in bills, and had no resource but to take it in that form. But for you that wretch would have got off safely with it. You see, therefore, that you have saved me more than enough to pay your wages for two years, even on the liberal scale I suggest.\" \"I was very fortunate to fall in with you, Mr. Bradford. It has given me the opening I have wanted for a long time.\" [Pg 189]\"I hope it may prove fortunate for both of us. Consider yourself, then, already in my employ. After breakfast I shall send you to Chicago for my own physician, under whose care I hope myself to go thither this afternoon.\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3009/83096.html","bookId":282,"book":{"id":282,"title":"The Train Boy","description":"简介： The four o\u0027clock afternoon train from Milwaukee, bound for Chicago, had just passed Truesdell, when the train boy passed through the cars with a pile of magazines under his arm....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3009","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:29 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:29 AM"}}
