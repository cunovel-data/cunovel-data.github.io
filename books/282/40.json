THE LADY\u0027S SECRET.","content":"With great politeness Paul selected a seat for the lady, took charge of her traveling-bag, and then, without betraying the least curiosity, took a seat in front of her. \"You are taking a great deal of trouble for me,\" she said, gratefully. \"No trouble at all,\" said Paul, cheerfully. \"That shows you have a kind heart. Have you a mother?\" \"Yes, madam;\" and Paul\u0027s face brightened as he thought how soon he should see her. He had not got weaned from his home and his mother, though he had reached the age at which many boys consider themselves entitled to do it. \"God grant she may long be spared to you!\" said the lady. \"Perhaps you have a son?\" said Paul, kindly. \"No; but if I had, I could wish he were such as you.\" \"Thank you.\" [Pg 270]\"Dutiful and affectionate to his mother, as I am sure you are, and kind and obliging even to strangers, as you have been to me.\" \"I am afraid you have been unfortunate, madam,\" said Paul, respectfully. \"Yes, I have met with sorrow. I will make you my confidant, since your kindness entitles you to my confidence.\" \"Do not think it necessary to speak of your troubles if it will give you pain,\" said our hero. \"It will bring me relief to speak to some one who will sympathize with me.\" Paul could not interpose further objection. Moreover, he was not without curiosity, and was desirous of learning in what way his new friend had suffered. \"Eight years since,\" she commenced, \"in the city of San Francisco, I met a gentleman who seemed struck with my appearance. At all events, he paid me marked attention, and it was not long before he asked my hand in marriage. I must premise that my father was considered rich, and I myself had a fortune of fifty thousand dollars at my own disposal. It had been bequeathed me by a sister of my mother. I forgot too late that it was the knowledge of this fact that had attracted my suitor, and that he was quite indifferent to me. However, I suspected nothing at the time. My lover, for he persuaded me that he was such, was[Pg 271] not lacking in devotion. Moreover, he had agreeable manners, and was well calculated by his smooth plausibility to deceive any one, certainly an inexperienced girl like myself. \"Well, to cut matters short, his suit was accepted. Not only did I favor him, but my father and mother were both well pleased with the match. We made a brief journey as far as Los Angeles, and on our return purchased a pleasant house on California street. \"Though my money was at my own disposal, I could not long resist the entreaties of my husband to give him the management of it. He professed to know how to invest it so as to double it in a year\u0027s time. On the strength of expected gains he lived in more expensive style than I thought prudent, and wasted more than I can guess at the gaming-table. At any rate, in less than two years the property was gone, and my father was obliged to come to our help. \"Now that I had nothing left, my husband began to treat me with cruel neglect. I feared even that he would raise his hand against me, and such was my misery that I hardly knew whether I was relieved or otherwise when one morning I found my husband missing, and a letter of farewell on my bureau, stating that I should never again see him.\" \"Have you never seen him since?\" asked Paul, with interest. [Pg 272]\"Never; but I have known for some time that he was in Chicago.\" \"And you wish to rejoin him?\" \"No, but to foil him in his wicked plans. I learned, four days since, that he was about to marry an estimable lady in Chicago, wholly forgetful of the wife he had deserted. I felt that there was no time to lose. As I knew my father would not consent to my journeying alone on such an errand, I departed from San Francisco secretly, and, as it proved, with insufficient money. You came to my assistance, and I shall take care that you do not lose by it.\" \"I have no anxiety on that point,\" said Paul. \"But I do not wish you to suffer for your kindness. You can do me still another favor.\" \"What is that?\" \"When we reach Chicago I do not wish to go to a hotel. If your mother will allow me to stay with her temporarily, I shall feel much indebted to her and to you.\" \"My mother lives in a very plain—indeed, in an humble style.\" \"As if I cared for that. I know she is good, since she has a good son.\" Paul saw no objection, and, on reaching Chicago, took the lady at once to his mother\u0027s lodgings.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3009/83111.html","bookId":282,"book":{"id":282,"title":"The Train Boy","description":"简介： The four o\u0027clock afternoon train from Milwaukee, bound for Chicago, had just passed Truesdell, when the train boy passed through the cars with a pile of magazines under his arm....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3009","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:29 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:29 AM"}}
