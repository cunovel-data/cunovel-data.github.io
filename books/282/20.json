{"id":8609,"no":20,"title":"CHAPTER XX. A PERSEVERING SUITOR.","content":"Grace saw the approach of Major Ashton, and surmised his object in seeking an interview. She would have avoided it, but she was at the moment unengaged, and Major Ashton was one of her guests. She owed him a measure of courtesy. When he offered his arm she accepted it with a bow, which she tried to accompany with a cordial manner. \"I congratulate you on the success of your party, Miss Dearborn,\" the major commenced. \"Thank you, Major Ashton. Then I may consider it such?\" \"Decidedly. I trust it may prove auspicious, since it is given in honor of your birthday.\" \"Thank you again. You are very kind.\" \"Shall we go into the conservatory?\" asked Major Ashton, as they approached the door that led into it. \"As you please,\" said Grace, hesitating. She was considering how soon she could politely get rid of the major. [Pg 151]They entered the conservatory, which at the time was occupied by another couple. Major Ashton glanced at them with a frown, for they were in his way. Presently they went back into the parlor, and his opportunity was found. \"Miss Dearborn—Grace,\" he began, hurriedly, \"I have been waiting for this chance to speak to you. I hope you have reconsidered your answer to my suit. I hope you have reflected how much my happiness is involved in your smiling upon my love.\" \"I am sorry you have renewed the subject, Major Ashton,\" said Grace, her cheek flushing with the annoyance she felt. \"I could not do otherwise. I am pleading for life.\" The words and tone were earnest enough, but failed to convey to Grace the idea of sincerity. She was persuaded that Major Ashton, less than any of her acquaintances, was in danger of dying of a broken heart, and she felt provoked that he should try to impose upon her. \"Let me suggest, Major Ashton,\" she said, \"that you have ill chosen your opportunity. To-night, at least, you might spare me.\" \"Spare you!\" repeated Major Ashton, in evident pique. \"Is then what I say so disagreeable to you?\" [Pg 152]\"It is unwelcome tonight at least.\" \"Then will you grant me another interview?\" he asked, earnestly. \"Doubtless you are right. I should not take up your time to-night. I will leave you at once if you will let me call to-morrow, or any other day soon.\" \"You may call, if you desire it, but I must say, plainly, that it will do no good. The answer I have already given you is final.\" \"I am not accustomed to be treated with such disdain,\" said Ashton, biting his lip. \"It may seem conceited to say so, but there is more than one young lady here to-night who would gladly accept what I have offered you. Miss Framley for instance.\" \"Then let me suggest that you offer your heart where it will be gladly accepted,\" returned Grace, calmly. If Major Ashton fancied he could excite Miss Dearborn\u0027s jealousy, the fancy was a very ridiculous one. She was entirely willing he should bestow himself wherever he chose—even upon Miss Framley. \"I hope you don\u0027t think I would throw myself away upon a vulgar shoddyite like Miss Framley.\" \"Miss Framley is my guest, Major Ashton,\" said[Pg 153] Grace, with quiet dignity. \"It doesn\u0027t become me to hear any words to her discredit.\" \"I think I can penetrate your secret, Miss Dearborn,\" said Major Ashton, with a sneer. \"You look with favor upon that poverty-stricken portrait painter with whom you so ostentatiously paraded early in the evening.\" \"You forget yourself, Major Ashton,\" said Grace, with chilling hauteur. She dropped his arm, and left the conservatory unattended, her cheek flushed, and her heart stirred with indignation. She came nearer to hating Major Ashton at that moment than ever before. He had insulted her, and though she was not one to make a scene, she was not likely soon to forgive or to forget it. Yet there was something in his words which was not altogether displeasing. They let in a sudden light, by which she read her own heart, and, with a quicker pulsation, she was compelled to confess that she did feel an interest in the young artist. Just then, too, lifting her eyes, she met the gaze of Frederic Vernon fixed upon her with an intensity which she could not fail to interpret. \"He loves me!\" she thought, and the thought gave her no displeasure. [Pg 154]She had no time to analyze her feelings, but of this she felt certain. Vernon, meeting her gaze, turned away in some confusion, but Grace was mistress of herself. Approaching him, she said, smiling: \"I hope you are enjoying yourself, Mr. Vernon.\" \"More so than I anticipated, Miss Dearborn,\" he answered, recovering himself. \"Then you did not anticipate enjoyment?\" she asked. \"Nay, do not misunderstand me. I am of late a stranger to such gay scenes, and I did not expect to meet many whom I knew, or with whom I could converse.\" \"There is Miss Framley,\" said Grace. \"Miss Framley does not feel inclined to notice me. I think she considers me too humble for recognition.\" \"That is amusing, certainly,\" said Grace. \"It is quite true.\" \"I sympathize with you, Mr. Vernon. Do not let Miss Framley\u0027s cruelty weigh upon you.\" \"I can bear it since I have your sympathy,\" answered Vernon, smiling brightly. \"How handsome he is when he smiles,\" thought Grace. \"It is clear he is a gentleman, notwithstanding the sneer of Major Ashton.\" \"Pardon me if I leave your parlor early, Miss Dearborn,\"[Pg 155] said Vernon. \"I may not readily gain opportunity of seeing you to take leave, and do so now.\" \"But why do you leave us so early, Mr. Vernon?\" \"My mother will sit up till I return, and for her the hour is already late.\" \"Then I will make no protest. A mother should always be considered.\" \"I was sure you would understand my reason. I shall be able to tell her that I have enjoyed myself. She wished me to come.\" \"You must introduce me to your mother some day, Mr. Vernon. I want to know her.\" \"And she will be delighted to know you.\" Of all the gay company Frederic Vernon was the first to go. \"So the portrait painter is gone!\" said Major Ashton to Miss Framley, whom he ran across once more. \"Yes. Poor fellow, he was evidently out of his element, and anxious to get away.\" \"Could not you detain him, Miss Framley, by your powerful fascinations?\" \"As if I would try!\" returned Miss Framley, tossing her head. \"You are too cruel!\" \"He looked at me as if he would like to claim acquaintance,\" said Miss Framley, complacently, \"but[Pg 156] I can tell you, Major Ashton, I am very careful about my company.\" \"But he was an acquaintance of yours,\" said Ashton. \"In the same way that ma knows the butcher and baker. I don\u0027t choose to let him think we are social equals. American society is too promiscuous, as ma often says. Don\u0027t you think so yourself, Major Ashton?\" \"No doubt your honored mother is right,\" answered Ashton, with a mocking smile. \"How nice it must be to live in England, and meet those dear, delightful earls, and dukes, and barons!\" exclaimed Miss Framley, rapturously. \"Did you ever know an earl or a duke, Major Ashton?\" \"Yes, I made the acquaintance of an earl once. We were passengers on the same steamer.\" \"Dear me, what a privilege! And how did he look?\" \"To the best of my remembrance he had the same number of eyes and ears as the rest of us.\" \"But didn\u0027t he look very distangay? Oh, how I should have admired to know him!\" \"He seemed very plain-looking, and he was perhaps the worst dressed man among the passengers.\" \"That is so strange!\" Miss Framley\u0027s idea of an earl or a duke was a tall,[Pg 157] majestic person, attired in purple and fine linen, with high-bred, aristocratic features, that might readily distinguish him from inferior beings. \"Oh, how I envy you the privilege of knowing him! Did you really become intimate?\" \"Very!\" answered Major Ashton, concealing under a grave face the amusement he felt. \"He told me confidentially how disagreeable his mother-in-law, the Countess of Somerset, was, and asked my advice as to how to manage her.\" \"How interesting!\" ejaculated Miss Framley, opening wide her eyes, as she speedily swallowed the major\u0027s words. She felt that it was something to know the intimate mind of an earl. She remained till the end of the party, and went home fully persuaded that Major Ashton admired her.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3009/83091.html","bookId":282,"book":{"id":282,"title":"The Train Boy","description":"简介： The four o\u0027clock afternoon train from Milwaukee, bound for Chicago, had just passed Truesdell, when the train boy passed through the cars with a pile of magazines under his arm....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3009","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:29 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:29 AM"}}
