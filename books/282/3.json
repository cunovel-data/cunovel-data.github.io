{"id":8592,"no":3,"title":"CHAPTER III. PAUL PALMER AT HOME.","content":"In a small two-story house, not far from the junction of a side street with Lake street, lived Mrs. Palmer, Paul\u0027s mother. It was rather shabby-looking externally, being sadly in want of paint, but Mrs. Palmer\u0027s rooms on the second floor were neatly, though plainly furnished, and scrupulously clean. There was an outside staircase, so that the second floor was independent of the first. Paul ran up stairs, and opened the door, entering at once into the sitting-room, where his mother and sister were seated. Mrs. Palmer\u0027s face brightened at the sight of Paul. He was always full of life and gayety, and his coming never failed to cheer her. \"So you are back again, Paul,\" she said, smiling a welcome. \"Yes, mother, and I am hungry, I can tell you. Is supper most ready?\" \"It will be in five minutes,\" said his mother, folding[Pg 26] up her work and going into the adjoining room. \"I have got some dipped toast for you to-night.\" \"Just what I like.\" \"But I delayed putting the toast into the dip till you came. There is some minced meat.\" \"In other words, hash,\" said Paul, laughing. \"I think you will find it good, in spite of the name.\" \"Oh, I am sure to like it, since it is home-made. At the restaurants I am a little afraid; I don\u0027t know but it may be made of dogs or cats.\" \"Do they make it of dogs or cats, Paul?\" asked his little sister, curiously. \"I don\u0027t know,\" said Paul; \"I won\u0027t swear to it. All I know is that there\u0027s a lot of dogs and cats that disappear mysteriously every year in Chicago.\" Meanwhile Mrs. Palmer had been busily completing her arrangements for supper, and it was ready within the five minutes mentioned. \"Supper\u0027s ready, Paul. I haven\u0027t made you wait long,\" she said. \"No, mother; you\u0027re always on time, like an express train.\" \"What sort of a day have you had, Paul? Did you sell much?\" \"Yes, more than usual. How much do you think I made?\" [Pg 27]\"A dollar and a quarter?\" \"More than that. A dollar and seventy-five cents.\" \"That is very good indeed. It would take me a week to make as much as that by sewing.\" \"They pay mean wages for sewing, mother. I wouldn\u0027t slave at that kind of work.\" \"I shouldn\u0027t like to depend upon that kind of work altogether, but I can just as well earn something that way. I don\u0027t want you to support Grace and me in idleness.\" \"No danger of your being idle, mother. That doesn\u0027t come natural to you. Some time or other I hope to support you as a lady.\" \"I hope you will be prospered, Paul; but I shall never be willing to fold my hands and do nothing.\" \"Then again I don\u0027t want always to live in this poor place,\" pursued Paul. \"It is comfortable. I feel fortunate in having so good a home.\" \"It would be easier to find a better one if we could afford to pay more rent. Of course this will do for the present. What have you been doing to-day, Grace?\" \"I went to school this morning, and I have been studying arithmetic and geography at home since school was over.\" \"You will become a famous scholar in time, Grace.\" [Pg 28]\"I never expect to know as much as mother,\" said Grace. \"I hope you will know a good deal more,\" said Mrs. Palmer. \"You know ever so much, mother.\" \"You think so now, because I know more than you; but the time will come when you will understand better how little your mother knows.\" \"Didn\u0027t you use to keep school, mother?\" \"Yes, but school-teachers don\u0027t know everything. Well, Paul, what have you seen to-day? To go to Milwaukee and back would be a great event to Grace and myself in our quiet course of life.\" \"I\u0027ve got used to it, mother. It\u0027s all in the day\u0027s work. Oh, I mustn\u0027t forget to tell you a lady had her pocket picked on our train to-day.\" \"Tell me about it, Paul,\" said Grace, with eager interest. So Paul told the story, very much as it has already been told in the last chapter. \"Did the pickpocket really jump off the train when it was going?\" asked Grace, her eyes wide open. \"Yes, Grace.\" \"Did he get hurt?\" \"No; the conductor and I watched from the platform, and saw him turn two or three somersets, but he got up quickly and made off.\" [Pg 29]\"It was taking a dangerous risk,\" said Mrs. Palmer. \"Yes; it is more of a risk than I would take for forty-seven dollars.\" \"Was that the sum taken?\" \"Yes.\" \"Poor young lady! What a loss it will be to her!\" \"She happens to be a rich young lady, mother. She didn\u0027t mind it any more than I would if I should lose ten cents, and perhaps not as much.\" \"Do you think the man will be caught, Paul?\" \"I don\u0027t know. I suppose he will keep in hiding for awhile. Anyhow, he got off with the money. I suppose he doesn\u0027t feel very friendly to me, as I was the one who detected him in the theft.\" \"Does he know that?\" \"Oh, yes.\" Mrs. Palmer looked rather alarmed. \"Be on your guard against him, Paul. He may do you a mischief sometime.\" \"I don\u0027t doubt he would like to; but I don\u0027t believe he will ride on that railroad again very soon, and I would not recommend him to go about much in Chicago.\" \"How do you know the lady was rich, Paul?\" asked Grace. \"I know more than that. I know what her name is,\" said Paul. [Pg 30]\"What is it?\" \"Grace Dearborn.\" \"Why, her first name is the same as mine.\" \"So it is. Don\u0027t you think she might send a present to her namesake?\" \"She doesn\u0027t know anything about me,\" said the little girl. \"Don\u0027t be too sure of that.\" \"How should she?\" \"Because I told her. I can tell you something more. She sent you a present.\" \"Really and truly?\" asked Grace, in a flutter of excitement. \"Yes, really and truly. Now what do you hope it is?\" \"I don\u0027t know, I\u0027m sure. I should like a nice doll. I\u0027ve got a rag baby, but that isn\u0027t as good.\" \"She didn\u0027t send you a doll.\" \"No; I didn\u0027t expect she would; she wouldn\u0027t have any with her.\" \"No; young ladies do not generally carry dolls round with them. Still, you can buy a doll with what she did give you.\" Paul drew from his vest-pocket the small gold piece, and handed it to his little sister. \"How much is it, Paul?\" asked Grace, who wasn\u0027t in the habit of seeing gold coin. [Pg 31]\"Two dollars and a half, Gracie.\" \"Why, that\u0027s ever so much money. I can get a nice doll on State street for half a dollar.\" \"So you can, and keep the rest of the money for something useful.\" \"Miss Dearborn was very kind,\" said Mrs. Palmer. \"I suppose she made the present before she lost her purse.\" \"Yes. She invited me to bring Grace to call upon her some day. She lives on Ashland avenue.\" \"I should like to go, Paul.\" \"So you shall, Gracie.\" Meanwhile all the family had done justice to the supper, which, though certainly very plain, was palatable. As they rose from the supper-table, Paul took his hat from a peg, and said: \"I\u0027ll take a little walk, mother.\" \"In what direction, Paul?\" \"I shall go to Randolph street, and perhaps stroll down as far as State street. It is rather lively that way.\" \"Very well, Paul. I suppose you won\u0027t be out late?\" \"Oh, no. I always tell you beforehand when I stay out.\" [Pg 32]Paul had hardly been gone twenty minutes when an unsteady step was heard on the staircase outside, and there was a loud knock on the outer door. \"I\u0027m afraid it\u0027s Stephen,\" said Mrs. Palmer, nervously. \"I wish Paul were at home!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3009/83074.html","bookId":282,"book":{"id":282,"title":"The Train Boy","description":"简介： The four o\u0027clock afternoon train from Milwaukee, bound for Chicago, had just passed Truesdell, when the train boy passed through the cars with a pile of magazines under his arm....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3009","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:29 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:29 AM"}}
