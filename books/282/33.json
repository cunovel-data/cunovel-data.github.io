{"id":8622,"no":33,"title":"CHAPTER XXXIII. CHEYENNE.","content":"Paul looked about him with eager curiosity, for he had all a youth\u0027s keen zest in visiting unknown places. He saw one long street, of unusual width, lined with an indiscriminate variety of buildings from one-story saloons and offices to two and three-story buildings. The Inter-Ocean Hotel, in front of which his guide halted, was a fine brick structure of three stories, which seemed hardly at home in the loosely built town, which had sprung up as if by magic on the prairies. \"This is where I put up,\" said Mr. Scott. \"I\u0027ll take a room here, if they can give me one.\" \"I\u0027ll see that you have one. They know me—Jim Scott—and they\u0027d make room if they hadn\u0027t one. Do you know what they used to call this settlement?\" \"No.\" \"\u0027Hell on Wheels\u0027 was the name they give it in early days.\" \"Was that to invite settlers?\" asked Paul, laughing. \"I expect it was because it was about the roughest,[Pg 231] most lawless place between Omaha and Frisco. Why the principal occupation of the first settlers was gamblin\u0027, drinkin\u0027 rot-gut whisky, and shootin\u0027. There wasn\u0027t a day passed hardly but some chap was found lyin\u0027 in the street with a hole in his head or a bullet in his heart. I tell you them was rough times.\" \"I hope things have changed,\" said Paul, by no means prepossessed in favor of Cheyenne by what he had heard. \"If they haven\u0027t, I don\u0027t think I shall stay here long.\" \"Oh, yes, it\u0027s settled down, so that life is pretty safe. They had to raise a vigilance committee to set things straight like they did in Frisco. It\u0027s all right now.\" \"I am glad to hear it.\" Meanwhile they had entered the hotel, and Paul succeeded in securing a room adjoining that of Mr. Scott, or Jim Scott, as he insisted on being called. After he had washed and changed his clothing, he sat down to a substantial meal, which he enjoyed with the hearty appetite of youth. Then Mr. Scott invited him to take a walk about the town. \"I say, youngster, have you got a father and mother?\" \"My father is dead, but I have a mother and sister living.\" [Pg 232]\"And what did your mother say to your comin\u0027 out here?\" \"She was willing, knowing that I had my own way to make.\" \"I haven\u0027t chick or child myself. I had a wife once, but she died twenty years ago. Now I\u0027ve got money, but sometimes I feel lonely.\" \"It isn\u0027t too late for you to marry again, Mr. Scott.\" \"Mr. Scott?\" \"I mean Jim.\" \"Maybe you\u0027re right, but there ain\u0027t many women would hitch on to me except for my money, and I\u0027m better without such. I say, youngster, do you mind my keepin\u0027 company with you while you stay in these parts?\" \"Certainly not, Jim. I shall feel fortunate in having one with me who knows so much more about the country than I.\" \"That\u0027s all right, then. When do you want to start for Custer City?\" \"To-morrow, if there is a chance.\" \"Then I\u0027ll get ready, too.\" \"What is the distance?\" \"Two hundred and fifty miles, and pretty long miles, some of \u0027em.\" \"Do we travel by stage?\" [Pg 233]\"Yes. One has been put on lately. When I went first, I traveled by wagon, and was a week on the road, maybe ten days. Now, if you travel at night, we can reach Custer City in forty-eight hours or thereabouts.\" \"I suppose the road is a lonely one?\" \"You may say that. As far as Fort Laramie it is pretty well settled. There is a ranch about every twelve miles.\" \"Do you call that well settled?\" \"Well,\" said Jim, \"we call it so out here.\" \"I shouldn\u0027t think people would feel crowded, living at such distances.\" \"We like plenty of room, you see, Paul.\" The next morning Paul and his new friend started for Custer City, and in due time arrived at the Black Hills metropolis without any adventures that need recording. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3009/83104.html","bookId":282,"book":{"id":282,"title":"The Train Boy","description":"简介： The four o\u0027clock afternoon train from Milwaukee, bound for Chicago, had just passed Truesdell, when the train boy passed through the cars with a pile of magazines under his arm....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Children\u0027s","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3009","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:29 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:29 AM"}}
