{"id":110570,"no":24,"title":"Page 24","content":"TWENTY-FOUR\n IN SPITE OF ALL THE training I\u0027d received, all the lessons on Strigoi habits and how to defend against them, I\u0027d never ever actually seen one. It was scarier than I\u0027d expected.\n This time, when she swung at me again, I was ready. Sort of. I dodged back, slipping out of reach, wondering what chance I had. I remembered Dimitri\u0027s joke about the mall. No silver stake. Nothing to cut her head off with. No way to set her on fire. Running seemed like the best option after all, but she was blocking my way.\n Feeling useless, I simply backed down the hall as she advanced on me, her movements far more graceful than they\u0027d ever been in life.\n Then, also faster than she\u0027d ever moved in life, she leapt out, grabbed me, and slammed my head against the wall. Pain exploded in my skull, and I felt pretty sure that was blood I tasted in the back of my mouth. Frantically, I fought against her, trying to mount some kind of defense, but it was like fighting Dimitri on crack.\n \"My dear,\" murmured Victor, \"try not to kill her if you don\u0027t have to. We might be able to use her later.\"\n Natalie paused in her attack, giving me a moment to back up, but she never took her cold eyes off me. \"I\u0027ll try not to.\"\n There was a skeptical tone in her voice. \"Get out of here now. I\u0027ll meet you there when I\u0027m done.\"\n \"I can\u0027t believe you!\" I yelled after him. \"You got your own daughter to turn Strigoi?\"\n \"A last resort. A necessary sacrifice made for the greater good. Natalie understands.\" He left.\n \"Do you?\" I hoped I could stall her with talking, just like in the movies. I also hoped my questions would hide how utterly and completely terrified I was. \"Do you understand? God, Natalie. You...you turned. Just because he told you to?\"\n \"My father\u0027s a great man,\" she replied. \"He\u0027s going to save the Moroi from the Strigoi.\"\n \"Are you insane?\" I cried. I was backing up again and suddenly hit the wall. My nails dug into it, as though I could dig my way through. \"You are a Strigoi.\"\n She shrugged, almost seeming like the old Natalie. \"I had to do it to get him out of here before the others came. One Strigoi to save all of the Moroi. It\u0027s worth it, worth giving up the sun and the magic.\"\n \"But you\u0027ll want to kill Moroi! You won\u0027t be able to help it.\"\n \"He\u0027ll help me stay in control. If not, then they\u0027ll have to kill me.\" She reached out and grabbed my shoulders, and I shuddered at how casually she talked about her own death. It was almost as casual as the way she was no doubt contemplating my death.\n \"You are insane. You can\u0027t love him that much. You can\u0027t really - \"\n She threw me into a wall again, and as my body collapsed in a heap on the floor, I had a feeling I wouldn\u0027t be getting up this time. Victor had told her not to kill me...but there was a look in her eyes, a look that said she wanted to. She wanted to feed off me; the hunger was there. It was the Strigoi way. I shouldn\u0027t have talked to her, I realized. I\u0027d hesitated, just as Dimitri had warned.\n And then, suddenly, he was there, charging down the hallway like Death in a cowboy duster.\n Natalie spun around. She was fast, so fast. But Dimitri was fast too and avoided her attack, a look of pure power and strength on his face. With an eerie fascination, I watched them move, circling each other like partners in a deadly dance. She was stronger than him, clearly, but she was also a fresh Strigoi. Gaining superpowers doesn\u0027t mean you know how to use them.\n Dimitri, however, knew how to use the ones he had. After both giving and receiving some vicious hits, he made his move. The silver stake flashed in his hand like a streak of lightning, then it snaked forward - into her heart. He yanked it out and stepped back, his face impassive as she screamed and fell to the floor. After a few horrible moments, she stopped moving.\n Just as quickly, he was leaning over me, slipping his arms under my body. He stood up, carrying me like he had when I hurt my ankle.\n \"Hey, Comrade,\" I murmured, my own voice sounding sleepy. \"You were right about Strigoi.\" The world started to darken, and my eyelids drooped.\n \"Rose. Roza. Open your eyes.\" I\u0027d never heard his voice so strained, so frantic. \"Don\u0027t go to sleep on me. Not yet.\"\n I squinted up at him as he carried me out of the building, practically running toward the clinic. \"Was he right?\"\n \"Who?\"\n \"Victor...he said it couldn\u0027t have worked. The necklace.\"\n I started to drift off, lost in the blackness of my mind, but Dimitri prompted me back to consciousness.\n \"What do you mean?\"\n \"The spell. Victor said you had to want me...to care about me...for it to work.\" When he didn\u0027t say anything, I tried to grip his shirt, but my fingers were too weak. \"Did you? Did you want me?\"\n His words came out thickly. \"Yes, Roza. I did want you. I still do. I wish...we could be together.\"\n \"Then why did you lie to me?\"\n We reached the clinic, and he managed to open the door while still holding me. As soon as he stepped inside, he began yelling for help.\n \"Why did you lie?\" I murmured again.\n Still holding me in his arms, he looked down at me. I could hear voices and footsteps getting closer.\n \"Because we can\u0027t be together.\"\n \"Because of the age thing, right?\" I asked. \"Because you\u0027re my mentor?\"\n His fingertip gently wiped away a tear that had escaped down my cheek. \"That\u0027s part of it,\" he said. \"But also...well, you and I will both be Lissa\u0027s guardians someday. I need to protect her at all costs. If a pack of Strigoi come, I need to throw my body between them and her.\"\n \"I know that. Of course that\u0027s what you have to do.\" The black sparkles were dancing in front of my eyes again. I was fading out.\n \"No. If I let myself love you, I won\u0027t throw myself in front of her. I\u0027ll throw myself in front of you.\"\n The medical team arrived and took me out of his arms.\n And that was how, two days after being discharged, I ended up back in the clinic. My third time in the two months we\u0027d been back at the Academy. It had to be some kind of record. I definitely had a concussion and probably internal bleeding, but we never really found out. When your best friend is a kick-ass healer, you sort of don\u0027t have to worry about those things.\n I still had to stay there for a couple of days, but Lissa - and Christian, her new sidekick - almost never left my side when they weren\u0027t in class. Through them, I learned bits and pieces about the outside world. Dimitri had realized there was a Strigoi on campus when they\u0027d found Natalie\u0027s victim dead and drained of blood: Mr. Nagy of all people. A surprising choice, but since he was older, he\u0027d been able to put up less of a fight. No more Slavic art for us. The guardians in the detention center had been injured but not killed. She\u0027d simply slammed them around as she had me.\n Victor had been found and recaptured while trying to escape campus. I was glad, even though it meant Natalie\u0027s sacrifice had been for nothing. Rumors said that Victor hadn\u0027t seemed afraid at all when the royal guards came and carried him away. He\u0027d simply smiled the whole time, like he had some secret they didn\u0027t know about.\n Inasmuch as it could, life returned to normal after that. Lissa did no more cutting. The doctor prescribed her something - an anti-depressant or anti-anxiety drug, I couldn\u0027t remember which - that made her feel better. I\u0027d never really known anything about those kinds of pills. I thought they made people silly and happy. But it was a pill like any other, meant to fix something, and mostly it just kept her normal and feeling stable.\n Which was a good thing - because she had some other issues to deal with. Like Andre. She\u0027d finally believed Christian\u0027s story, and allowed herself to acknowledge that Andre might not have been the hero she\u0027d always believed him to be. It was hard on her, but she finally reached a peaceful decision, accepting that he could have had both good and bad sides, like we all do. What he\u0027d done to Mia saddened her, but it didn\u0027t change the fact that he\u0027d been a good brother who loved her. Most importantly, it finally freed her from feeling like she needed to be him to make her family proud. She could be herself - which she proved daily in her relationship with Christian.\n The school still couldn\u0027t get over that. She didn\u0027t care. She laughed it off, ignoring the shocked looks and disdain from the royals who couldn\u0027t believe she\u0027d date someone from a humiliated family. Not all of them felt that way though. Some who had gotten to know her during her brief social whirlwind actually liked her for her, no compulsion necessary. They liked her honesty and openness, preferring it to the games most royals played.\n A lot of royals ignored her, of course, and talked viciously about her behind her back. Most surprising of all, Mia - despite being utterly humiliated - managed to wiggle back into the good graces of a couple of these royals. It proved my point. She wouldn\u0027t stay down for long. And, in fact, I saw the first signs of her revenge lurking again when I walked past her one day on the way to class. She stood with a few other people and spoke loudly, clearly wanting me to hear.\n \" - perfect match. Both of them are from completely disgraced and rejected families.\"\n I clenched my teeth and kept walking, following her gaze to where Lissa and Christian stood. They were lost in their own world and formed a gorgeous picture, she blond and fair and he blue-eyed and black-haired. I couldn\u0027t help but stare too. Mia was right. Both of their families were disgraced. Tatiana had publicly denounced Lissa, and while no one \"blamed\" the Ozeras for what had happened to Christian\u0027s parents, the rest of the royal Moroi families continued to keep their distance.\n But Mia had been right about the other part too. In some ways, Lissa and Christian were perfect for each other. Maybe they were outcasts, but the Dragomirs and Ozeras had once been among the most powerful Moroi leaders. And in only a very short time, Lissa and Christian had started shaping one another in ways that could put them right up there with their ancestors. He was picking up some of her polish and social poise; she was learning to stand up for her passions. The more I watched them, the more I could see an energy and confidence radiating around them.\n They weren\u0027t going to stay down either.\n And I think that, along with Lissa\u0027s kindness, may have been what attracted people to her. Our social circle began to steadily grow. Mason joined, of course, and made no secret of his interest in me. Lissa teased me a lot about that, and I didn\u0027t yet know what to do about him. Part of me thought maybe it was time to give him a shot as a serious boyfriend, even though the rest of me yearned for Dimitri.\n For the most part, Dimitri treated me just like anyone would expect of a mentor. He was efficient. Fond. Strict. Understanding. There was nothing out of the ordinary, nothing that would make anyone suspect what had passed between us - save for an occasional meeting of our eyes. And once I overcame my initial emotional reaction, I knew he was - technically - right about us. Age was a problem, yes, particularly while I was still a student at the Academy. But the other thing he\u0027d mentioned...it had never entered my mind. It should have. Two guardians in a relationship could distract each other from the Moroi they were supposed to protect. We couldn\u0027t allow that to happen, couldn\u0027t risk her life for our own wants. Otherwise, we\u0027d be no better than the Badica guardian who\u0027d run off. I\u0027d told Dimitri once that my own feelings didn\u0027t matter. She came first.\n I just hoped I could prove it.\n \"It\u0027s too bad about the healing,\" Lissa told me.\n \"Hmm?\" We sat in her room, pretending to study, but my mind was off thinking about Dimitri. I\u0027d lectured her about keeping secrets, but I hadn\u0027t told her about him or about how close I\u0027d come to losing my virginity. For some reason, I couldn\u0027t bring myself to tell.\n She dropped the history book she\u0027d been holding. \"That I had to give up the healing. And the compulsion.\" A frown crossed her face at that last part. The healing had been regarded as a wondrous gift in need of further study; the compulsion had met with serious reprimands from Kirova and Ms. Carmack. \"I mean, I\u0027m happy now. I should have gotten help a long time ago - you were right about that. I\u0027m glad I\u0027m on the medication. But Victor was right too. I can\u0027t use spirit anymore. I can still sense it, though...I miss being able to touch it.\"\n I didn\u0027t entirely know what to say. I liked her better like this. Losing that threat of madness had made her whole again, confident and outgoing, just like the Lissa I\u0027d always known and loved. Seeing her now, it was easy to believe what Victor had said about her becoming a leader. She reminded me of her parents and of Andre - how they used to inspire devotion in those who knew them.\n \"And that\u0027s another thing,\" she continued. \"He said I couldn\u0027t give it up. He was right. It hurts, not having the magic. I want it so badly sometimes.\"\n \"I know,\" I said. I could feel that ache within her. The pills had dulled her magic, but not our bond.\n \"And I keep thinking about all the things I could do, all the people I could help.\" She looked regretful.\n \"You have to help yourself first,\" I told her fiercely. \"I don\u0027t want you getting hurt again. I won\u0027t let you.\"\n \"I know. Christian says the same thing.\" She got that dopey smile she always did when she thought about him. If I\u0027d known what idiots being in love would make them, I might not have been so keen to get them back together. \"And I guess you guys are right. Better to want the magic and be sane than to have it and be a lunatic. There\u0027s no middle ground.\"\n \"No,\" I agreed. \"Not with this.\"\n Then, out of nowhere, a thought smacked me in the head. There was a middle ground. Natalie\u0027s words reminded me of it. It\u0027s worth it, worth giving up the sun and the magic.\n The magic.\n Ms. Karp hadn\u0027t become Strigoi simply because she\u0027d gone crazy. She\u0027d become Strigoi to stay sane. Becoming Strigoi cut a person completely off from magic. In doing that, she couldn\u0027t use it. She couldn\u0027t feel it. She wouldn\u0027t want it anymore. Staring at Lissa, I felt a knot of worry coil within me.\n What if she figured that out? Would she want to do it too? No, I quickly decided. Lissa would never do that. She was too strong a person, too moral. And so long as she stayed on the pills, her higher reasoning would keep her from doing something so drastic.\n Still, the whole concept prodded me to find out one last thing. The following morning, I went to the chapel and waited in one of the pews until the priest showed up.\n \"Hello, Rosemarie,\" he said, clearly surprised. \"Can I help you with something?\"\n I stood up. \"I need to know more about St. Vladimir. I read that book you gave me and a couple others.\" Best not to tell him about stealing the ones in the attic. \"But nobody told how he died. What happened? How did his life end? Was he, like, martyred?\"\n The priest\u0027s bushy eyebrows rose. \"No. He died of old age. Peacefully.\"\n \"You\u0027re sure? He didn\u0027t become Strigoi or kill himself?\"\n \"No, of course not. Why would you think that?\"\n \"Well...he was holy and everything, but he was also kind of crazy, right? I read about it. I thought he might have, I don\u0027t know, given into that.\"\n His face was serious. \"It\u0027s true he fought demons - insanity - his whole life. It was a struggle, and he did want to die sometimes. But he overcame it. He didn\u0027t let it defeat him.\"\n I stared in wonder. Vladimir wouldn\u0027t have had pills, and he\u0027d clearly continued to use magic.\n \"How? How did he do that?\"\n \"Willpower, I guess. Well...\" He paused. \"That and Anna.\"\n \"Shadow-kissed Anna,\" I murmured. \"His guardian.\"\n The priest nodded. \"She stayed with him. When he grew weak, she was the one who held him up. She urged him to stay strong and to never give in to his madness.\"\n I left the chapel in a daze. Anna had done it. Anna had let Vladimir walk that middle ground, helping him to work miracles in the world without meeting a horrible end. Ms. Karp hadn\u0027t been as lucky. She hadn\u0027t had a bound guardian. She hadn\u0027t had anyone to hold her up.\n Lissa did.\n Smiling, I cut across the quadrangle toward the commons. I felt better about life than I had in a very long time. We could do this, Lissa and me. We could do it together.\n Just then, I saw a dark figure out of the corner of my eye. It swooped past me and landed on a nearby tree. I stopped walking. It was a raven, large and fierce-looking, with shining black feathers.\n A moment later, I realized it wasn\u0027t just a raven; it was the raven. The one Lissa had healed. No other bird would land so close to a dhampir. And no other bird would be looking at me in such an intelligent, familiar way. I couldn\u0027t believe he was still around. A chill ran down my spine, and I started to back up. Then the truth hit me.\n \"You\u0027re bound to her too, aren\u0027t you?\" I asked, fully aware that anyone who saw me would think I was crazy. \"She brought you back. You\u0027re shadow-kissed.\"\n That was actually pretty cool. I held out my arm to it, half hoping it\u0027d come land on me in some sort of dramatic, movie-worthy gesture. All it did was look at me like I was an idiot, spread its wings, and fly off.\n I glared as it flew off into the twilight. Then I turned around and headed off to find Lissa. From far away, I heard the sound of cawing, almost like laughter. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire-academy-vampire-academy-1/page-24.html","bookId":2060,"book":{"id":2060,"title":"Vampire Academy (Vampire Academy #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Vampire Academy Series 1: Vampire Academy \n After two years on the run, best friends Rose, half-human/half-vampire, and Lissa, a mortal vampire princess, are caught and returned to St. Vladimir\u0027s Academy.
