{"id":110559,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"TWELVE SLEEP CAME RELUCTANTLY THAT NIGHT and I tossed and turned for a long time before finally going under. An hour or so later, I sat up in bed, trying to relax and sort out the emotions coming to me. Lissa. Scared and upset. Unstable. The night\u0027s events suddenly came rushing back to me as I went through what could be bothering her. The queen humiliating her. Mia. Maybe even Christian - he could have found her for all I knew. Yet...none of those was the problem right now. Buried within her, there was something else. Something terribly wrong. I climbed out of bed, dressed hastily, and considered my options. I had a third-floor room now - way too high to climb down from, particularly since I had no Ms. Karp to patch me up this time. I would never be able to sneak out of the main hall. That only left going through the \"appropriate\" channels. \"Where do you think you\u0027re going?\" One of the matrons who supervised my hall looked up from her chair. She sat stationed at the end of the hall, near the stairs going down. During the day, that stairwell had loose supervision. At night, we might as well have been in jail. I crossed my arms. \"I need to see Dim - Guardian Belikov.\" \"It\u0027s late.\" \"It\u0027s an emergency.\" She looked me up and down. \"You seem okay to me.\" \"You\u0027re going to be in so much trouble tomorrow when everyone finds out you stopped me from reporting what I know.\" \"Tell me.\" \"It\u0027s private guardian stuff.\" I gave her as hard a stare as I could manage. It must have worked, because she finally stood up and pulled out a cell phone. She called someone - Dimitri, I hoped - but murmured too low for me to hear. We waited several minutes, and then the door leading to the stairs opened. Dimitri appeared, fully dressed and alert, though I felt pretty sure we\u0027d pulled him out of bed. He took one look at me. \"Lissa.\" I nodded. Without another word, he turned around and started back down the stairs. I followed. We walked across the quad in silence, toward the imposing Moroi dorm. It was \"night\" for the vampires, which meant it was daytime for the rest of the world. Mid-afternoon sun shone with a cold, golden light on us. The human genes in me welcomed it and always sort of regretted how Moroi light sensitivity forced us to live in darkness most of the time. Lissa\u0027s hall matron gaped when we appeared, but Dimitri was too intimidating to oppose. \"She\u0027s in the bathroom,\" I told them. When the matron started to follow me inside, I wouldn\u0027t let her. \"She\u0027s too upset. Let me talk to her alone first.\" Dimitri considered. \"Yes. Give them a minute.\" I pushed the door open. \"Liss?\" A soft sound, like a sob, came from within. I walked down five stalls and found the only one closed. I knocked softly. \"Let me in,\" I said, hoping I sounded calm and strong. I heard a sniffle, and a few moments later, the door unlatched. I wasn\u0027t prepared for what I saw. Lissa stood before me... ...covered in blood. Horrified, I squelched a scream and almost called for help. Looking more closely, I saw that a lot of the blood wasn\u0027t actually coming from her. It was smeared on her, like it had been on her hands and she\u0027d rubbed her face. She sank to the floor, and I followed, kneeling before her. \"Are you okay?\" I whispered. \"What happened?\" She only shook her head, but I saw her face crumple as more tears spilled from her eyes. I took her hands. \"Come on. Let\u0027s get you cleaned - \" I stopped. She was bleeding after all. Perfect lines crossed her wrists, not near any crucial veins, but enough to leave wet, red tracks across her skin. She hadn\u0027t hit her veins when she did this; death hadn\u0027t been her goal. She met my eyes. \"I\u0027m sorry...I didn\u0027t mean...Please don\u0027t let them know...\" she sobbed. \"When I saw it, I freaked out.\" She nodded toward her wrists. \"This just happened before I could stop. I was upset...\" \"It\u0027s okay,\" I said automatically, wondering what \"it\" was. \"Come on.\" I heard a knock on the door. \"Rose?\" \"Just a sec,\" I called back. I took her to the sink and rinsed the blood off her wrists. Grabbing the first-aid kit, I hastily put some Band-Aids on the cuts. The bleeding had already slowed. \"We\u0027re coming in,\" the matron called. I jerked off my hoodie sweatshirt and quickly handed it to Lissa. She had just pulled it on when Dimitri and the matron entered. He raced to our sides in an instant, and I realized that in hiding Lissa\u0027s wrists, I\u0027d forgotten the blood on her face. \"It\u0027s not mine,\" she said quickly, seeing his expression. \"It...it\u0027s the rabbit...\" Dimitri assessed her, and I hoped he wouldn\u0027t look at her wrists. When he seemed satisfied she had no gaping wounds, he asked, \"What rabbit?\" I was wondering the same thing. With shaking hands, she pointed at the trash can. \"I cleaned it up. So Natalie wouldn\u0027t see.\" Dimitri and I both walked over and peered into the can. I pulled myself away immediately, swallowing back my stomach\u0027s need to throw up. I don\u0027t know how Lissa knew it was a rabbit. All I could see was blood. Blood and blood-soaked paper towels. Globs of gore I couldn\u0027t identify. The smell was horrible. Dimitri shifted closer to Lissa, bending down until they were at eye level. \"Tell me what happened.\" He handed her several tissues. \"I came back about an hour ago. And it was there. Right there in the middle of the floor. Torn apart. It was like it had...exploded.\" She sniffed. \"I didn\u0027t want Natalie to find it, didn\u0027t want to scare her...so I-I cleaned it up. Then I just couldn\u0027t...I couldn\u0027t go back...\" She began to cry, and her shoulders shook. I could figure out the rest, the part she didn\u0027t tell Dimitri. She\u0027d found the rabbit, cleaned up, and freaked out. Then she\u0027d cut herself, but it was the weird way she coped with things that upset her. \"No one should be able to get into those rooms!\" exclaimed the matron. \"How is this happening?\" \"Do you know who did it?\" Dimitri\u0027s voice was gentle. Lissa reached into her pajama pocket and pulled out a crumpled piece of paper. It had so much blood soaked into it, I could barely read it as he held it and smoothed it out. I know what you are. You won\u0027t survive being here. I\u0027ll make sure of it. Leave now. It\u0027s the only way you might live through this. The matron\u0027s shock transformed into something more determined, and she headed for the door. \"I\u0027m getting Ellen.\" It took me a second to remember that was Kirova\u0027s first name. \"Tell her we\u0027ll be at the clinic,\" said Dimitri. When she left, he turned to Lissa. \"You should lie down.\" When she didn\u0027t move, I linked my arm through hers. \"Come on, Liss. Let\u0027s get you out of here.\" Slowly, she put one foot in front of the other and let us lead her to the Academy\u0027s medical clinic. It was normally staffed by a couple of doctors, but at this time of night, only a nurse stayed on duty. She offered to wake one of the doctors, but Dimitri declined. \"She just needs to rest.\" Lissa had no sooner stretched out on a narrow bed than Kirova and a few others showed up and started questioning her. I thrust myself in front of them, blocking her. \"Leave her alone! Can\u0027t you see she doesn\u0027t want to talk about it? Let her get some sleep first!\" \"Miss Hathaway,\" declared Kirova, \"you\u0027re out of line as usual. I don\u0027t even know what you\u0027re doing here.\" Dimitri asked if he could speak with her privately and led her into the hall. I heard angry whispers from her, calm and firm ones from him. When they returned, she said stiffly, \"You may stay with her for a little while. We\u0027ll have janitors do further cleaning and investigation in the bathroom and your room, Miss Dragomir, and then discuss the situation in detail in the morning.\" \"Don\u0027t wake Natalie,\" whispered Lissa. \"I don\u0027t want to scare her. I cleaned up everything in the room anyway.\" Kirova looked doubtful. The group retreated but not before the nurse asked if Lissa wanted anything to eat or drink. She declined. Once we were alone, I lay down beside her and put my arm around her. \"I won\u0027t let them find out,\" I told her, sensing her worry about her wrists. \"But I wish you\u0027d told me before I left the reception. You\u0027d said you\u0027d always come to me first.\" \"I wasn\u0027t going to do it then,\" she said, her eyes staring blankly off. \"I swear, I wasn\u0027t going to. I mean, I was upset...but I thought...I thought I could handle it. I was trying so hard...really, Rose. I was. But then I got back to my room, and I saw it, and I...just lost it. It was like the last straw, you know? And I knew I had to clean it up. Had to clean it up before they saw, before they found out, but there was so much blood...and afterward, after it was done, it was too much, and I felt like I was going to...I don\u0027t know...explode, and it was just too much, I had to let it out, you know? I had to - \" I interrupted her hysteria. \"It\u0027s okay, I understand.\" That was a lie. I didn\u0027t get her cutting at all. She\u0027d done it sporadically, ever since the accident, and it scared me each time. She\u0027d try to explain it to me, how she didn\u0027t want to die - she just needed to get it out somehow. She felt so much emotionally, she would say that a physical outlet - physical pain - was the only way to make the internal pain go away. It was the only way she could control it. \"Why is this happening?\" she cried into her pillow. \"Why am I a freak?\" \"You aren\u0027t a freak.\" \"No one else has this happen to them. No one else does magic like I can.\" \"Did you try to do magic?\" No answer. \"Liss? Did you try to heal the rabbit?\" \"I reached out, just to see if I could maybe fix it, but there was just too much blood...I couldn\u0027t.\" The more she uses it, the worse it\u0027ll get. Stop her, Rose. Lissa was right. Moroi magic could conjure fire and water, move rocks and other pieces of earth. But no one could heal or bring animals back from the dead. No one except Ms. Karp. Stop her before they notice, before they notice and take her away too. Get her out of here. I hated carrying this secret, mostly because I didn\u0027t know what to do about it. I didn\u0027t like feeling powerless. I needed to protect her from this - and from herself. And yet, at the same time, I needed to protect her from them, too. \"We should go,\" I said abruptly. \"We\u0027re going to leave.\" \"Rose - \" \"It\u0027s happening again. And it\u0027s worse. Worse than last time.\" \"You\u0027re afraid of the note.\" \"I\u0027m not afraid of any note. But this place isn\u0027t safe.\" I suddenly longed for Portland again. It might be dirtier and more crowded than the rugged Montana landscape, but at least you knew what to expect - not like here. Here at the Academy, past and present warred with each other. It might have its beautiful old walls and gardens, but inside, modern things were creeping in. People didn\u0027t know how to handle that. It was just like the Moroi themselves. Their archaic royal families still held the power on the surface, but people were growing discontent. Dhampirs who wanted more to their lives. Moroi like Christian who wanted to fight the Strigoi. The royals still clung to their traditions, still touted their power over everyone else, just as the Academy\u0027s elaborate iron gates put on a show of tradition and invincibility. And, oh, the lies and secrets. They ran through the halls and hid in the corners. Someone here hated Lissa, someone who was probably smiling right to her face and pretending to be her friend. I couldn\u0027t let them destroy her. \"You need to get some sleep,\" I told her. \"I can\u0027t sleep.\" \"Yes, you can. I\u0027m right here. You won\u0027t be alone.\" Anxiety and fear and other troubled emotions coursed through her. But in the end, her body\u0027s needs won out. After a while, I saw her eyes close. Her breathing became even, and the bond grew quiet. I watched her sleep, too keyed up with adrenaline to allow myself any rest. I think maybe an hour had passed when the nurse returned and told me I had to leave. \"I can\u0027t go,\" I said. \"I promised her she wouldn\u0027t be alone.\" The nurse was tall, even for a Moroi, with kind brown eyes. \"She won\u0027t be. I\u0027ll stay with her.\" I regarded her skeptically. \"I promise.\" Back in my room, I had my own crash. The fear and excitement had worn me out too, and for an instant, I wished I could have a normal life and a normal best friend. Immediately, I cast that thought out. No one was normal, not really. And I\u0027d never have a better friend than Lissa...but man, it was so hard sometimes. I slept heavily until morning. I went to my first class tentatively, nervous that word about last night had gotten around. As it turned out, people were talking about last night, but their attention was still focused on the queen and the reception. They knew nothing about the rabbit. As hard as it was to believe, I\u0027d nearly forgotten about that other stuff. Still, it suddenly seemed like a small thing compared to someone causing a bloody explosion in Lissa\u0027s room. Yet, as the day went on, I noticed something weird. People stopped looking at Lissa so much. The started looking at me. Whatever. Ignoring them, I hunted around and found Lissa finishing up with a feeder. That funny feeling I always got came over me as I watched her mouth work against the feeder\u0027s neck, drinking his blood. A trickle of it ran down his throat, standing out against his pale skin. Feeders, though human, were nearly as pale as Moroi from all the blood loss. He didn\u0027t seem to notice; he was long gone on the high of the bite. Drowning in jealousy, I decided I needed therapy. \"You okay?\" I asked her later, on our way to class. She wore long sleeves, purposefully obscuring her wrists. \"Yeah...I still can\u0027t stop thinking about that rabbit...It was so horrible. I keep seeing it in my head. And then what I did.\" She squeezed her eyes shut, just for a moment, and then opened them again. \"People are talking about us.\" \"I know. Ignore them.\" \"I hate it,\" she said angrily. A surge of darkness shot up into her and through the bond. It made me cringe. My best friend was lighthearted and kind. She didn\u0027t have feelings like that. \"I hate all the gossip. It\u0027s so stupid. How can they all be so shallow?\" \"Ignore them,\" I repeated soothingly. \"You were smart not to hang out with them anymore.\" Ignoring them grew harder and harder, though. The whispers and looks increased. In animal behavior, it became so bad, I couldn\u0027t even concentrate on my now-favorite subject. Ms. Meissner had started talking about evolution and survival of the fittest and how animals sought mates with good genes. It fascinated me, but even she had a hard time staying on task, since she had to keep yelling at people to quiet down and pay attention. \"Something\u0027s going on,\" I told Lissa between classes. \"I don\u0027t know what, but they\u0027re all over something new.\" \"Something else? Other than the queen hating me? What more could there be?\" \"Wish I knew.\" Things finally came to a head in our last class of the day, Slavic art. It started when a guy I barely knew made a very explicit and nearly obscene suggestion to me while we all worked on individual projects. I replied in kind, letting him know exactly what he could do with his request. He only laughed. \"Come on, Rose. I bleed for you.\" Loud giggles ensued, and Mia cut us a taunting look. \"Wait, it\u0027s Rose who does the bleeding, right?\" More laughter. Understanding slapped me in the face. I jerked Lissa away. \"They know.\" \"Know what?\" \"About us. About how you...you know, how I fed you while we were gone.\" She gaped. \"How?\" \"How do you think? Your ¡®friend\u0027 Christian.\" \"No,\" she said adamantly. \"He wouldn\u0027t have.\" \"Who else knew?\" Faith in Christian flashed in her eyes and in our bond. But she didn\u0027t know what I knew. She didn\u0027t know how I\u0027d bitched him out last night, how I\u0027d made him think she hated him. The guy was unstable. Spreading our biggest secret - well, one of them - would be an adequate revenge. Maybe he\u0027d killed the rabbit, too. After all, it had died only a couple hours after I\u0027d told him off. Not waiting around to hear her protests, I stalked off to the other side of the room where Christian was working by himself, as usual. Lissa followed in my wake. Not caring if people saw us, I leaned across the table toward him, putting my face inches from his. \"I\u0027m going to kill you.\" His eyes darted to Lissa, the faintest glimmer of longing in them, and then a scowl spread over his face. \"Why? Is it like guardian extra credit?\" \"Stop with the attitude,\" I warned, pitching my voice low. \"You told. You told how Lissa had to feed off me.\" \"Tell her,\" said Lissa desperately. \"Tell her she\u0027s wrong.\" Christian dragged his eyes from me to her, and as they regarded each other, I felt such a powerful wave of attraction, it was a wonder it didn\u0027t knock me over. Her heart was in her eyes. It was obvious to me he felt the same way about her, but she couldn\u0027t see it, particularly since he was still glaring at her. \"You can stop it, you know,\" he said. \"You don\u0027t have to pretend anymore.\" Lissa\u0027s giddy attraction vanished, replaced by hurt and shock over his tone. \"I...what? Pretend what?...\" \"You know what. Just stop. Stop with the act.\" Lissa stared at him, her eyes wide and wounded. She had no clue I\u0027d gone off on him last night. She had no clue that he believed she hated him. \"Get over feeling sorry for yourself, and tell us what\u0027s going on,\" I snapped at him. \"Did you or didn\u0027t you tell them?\" He fixed me with a defiant look. \"No. I didn\u0027t.\" \"I don\u0027t believe you.\" \"I do,\" said Lissa. \"I know it\u0027s impossible to believe a freak like me could keep his mouth shut - especially since neither of you can - but I have better things to do than spread stupid rumors. You want someone to blame? Blame your golden boy over there.\" I followed his gaze to where Jesse was laughing about something with that idiot Ralf. \"Jesse doesn\u0027t know,\" said Lissa defiantly. Christian\u0027s eyes were glued to me. \"He does, though. Doesn\u0027t he, Rose? He knows.\" My stomach sank out of me. Yes. Jesse did know. He\u0027d figured it out that night in the lounge. \"I didn\u0027t think...I didn\u0027t think he\u0027d tell. He was too afraid of Dimitri.\" \"You told him?\" exclaimed Lissa. \"No, he guessed.\" I was starting to feel sick. \"He apparently did more than guess,\" muttered Christian. I turned on him. \"What\u0027s that supposed to mean?\" \"Oh. You don\u0027t know.\" \"I swear to God, Christian, I\u0027m going to break your neck after class.\" \"Man, you really are unstable.\" He said it almost happily, but his next words were more serious. He still wore that sneer, still glowed with anger, but when he spoke, I could hear the faintest uneasiness in his voice. \"He sort of elaborated on what was in your note. Got into a little more detail.\" \"Oh, I get it. He said we had sex.\" I didn\u0027t need to mince words. Christian nodded. So. Jesse was trying to boost his own reputation. Okay. That I could deal with. Not like my reputation was that stellar to begin with. Everyone already believed I had sex all the time. \"And uh, Ralf too. That you and he - \" Ralf? No amount of alcohol or any illegal substance would make me touch him. \"I - what? That I had sex with Ralf too?\" Christian nodded. \"That asshole! I\u0027m going to - \" \"There\u0027s more.\" \"How? Did I sleep with the basketball team?\" \"He said - they both said - you let them...well, you let them drink your blood.\" That stopped even me. Drinking blood during sex. The dirtiest of the dirty. Sleazy. Beyond being easy or a slut. A gazillion times worse than Lissa drinking from me for survival. Blood-whore territory. \"That\u0027s crazy!\" Lissa cried. \"Rose would never - Rose?\" But I wasn\u0027t listening anymore. I was in my own world, a world that took me across the classroom to where Jesse and Ralf sat. They both looked up, faces half smug and half...nervous, if I had to guess. Not unexpected, since they were both lying through their teeth. The entire class came to a standstill. Apparently they\u0027d been expecting some type of showdown. My unstable reputation in action. \"What the hell do you think you\u0027re doing?\" I asked in a low, dangerous voice. Jesse\u0027s nervous look turned to one of terror. He might have been taller than me, but we both knew who would win if I turned violent. Ralf, however, gave me a cocky smile. \"We didn\u0027t do anything you didn\u0027t want us to do.\" His smiled turned cruel. \"And don\u0027t even think about laying a hand on us. You start a fight, and Kirova\u0027ll kick you out to go live with the other blood whores.\" The rest of the students were holding their breaths, waiting to see what we\u0027d do. I don\u0027t know how Mr. Nagy could have been oblivious to the drama occurring in his class. I wanted to punch both of them, hit them so hard that it\u0027d make Dimitri\u0027s brawl with Jesse look like a pat on the back. I wanted to wipe that smirk off Ralf\u0027s face. But asshole or not, he was right. If I touched them, Kirova would expel me in the blink of an eye. And if I got kicked out, Lissa would be alone. Taking a deep breath, I made one of the hardest decisions of my life. I walked away. The rest of the day was miserable. In backing down from the fight, I opened myself up to mockery from everyone else. The rumors and whispers grew louder. People stared at me openly. People laughed. Lissa kept trying to talk to me, to console me, but I ignored even her. I went through the rest of my classes like a zombie, and then I headed off to practice with Dimitri as fast I could. He gave me a puzzled look but didn\u0027t ask any questions. Alone in my room later on, I cried for the first time in years. Once I got that out of my system, I was about to put on my pajamas when I heard a knock at my door. Dimitri. He studied my face and then glanced away, obviously aware I\u0027d been crying. I could tell, too, that the rumors had finally reached him. He knew. \"Are you okay?\" \"It doesn\u0027t matter if I am, remember?\" I looked up at him. \"Is Lissa okay? This\u0027ll be hard on her.\" A funny look crossed his face. I think it astonished him that I\u0027d still be worried about her at a time like this. He beckoned me to follow and led me out to a back stairwell, one that usually stayed locked to students. But it was open tonight, and he gestured me outside. \"Five minutes,\" he warned. More curious than ever, I stepped outside. Lissa stood there. I should have sensed she was close, but my own out-of-control feelings had obscured hers. Without a word, she put her arms around me and held me for several moments. I had to hold back more tears. When we broke apart, she looked at me with calm, level eyes. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" she said. \"Not your fault. It\u0027ll pass.\" She clearly doubted that. So did I. \"It is my fault,\" she said. \"She did it to get back at me.\" \"She?\" \"Mia. Jesse and Ralf aren\u0027t smart enough to think of something like that on their own. You said it yourself: Jesse was too scared of Dimitri to talk much about what happened. And why wait until now? It happened a while ago. If he\u0027d wanted to spread stuff around, he would have done it back then. Mia\u0027s doing this as retaliation for you talking about her parents. I don\u0027t know how she managed it, but she\u0027s the one who got them to say those things.\" In my gut, I realized Lissa was right. Jesse and Ralf were the tools; Mia had been the mastermind. \"Nothing to be done now,\" I sighed. \"Rose - \" \"Forget it, Liss. It\u0027s done, okay?\" She studied me quietly for a few seconds. \"I haven\u0027t seen you cry in a long time.\" \"I wasn\u0027t crying.\" A feeling of heartache and sympathy beat through to me from the bond. \"She can\u0027t do this to you,\" she argued. I laughed bitterly, half surprised at my own hopelessness. \"She already did. She said she\u0027d get back at me, that I wouldn\u0027t be able to protect you. She did it. When I go back to classes...\" A sickening feeling settled in my stomach. I thought about the friends and respect I\u0027d managed to eke out, despite our low profile. That would be gone. You couldn\u0027t come back from something like this. Not among the Moroi. Once a blood whore, always a blood whore. What made it worse was that some dark, secret part of me did like being bitten. \"You shouldn\u0027t have to keep protecting me,\" she said. I laughed. \"That\u0027s my job. I\u0027m going to be your guardian.\" \"I know, but I meant like this. You shouldn\u0027t suffer because of me. You shouldn\u0027t always have to look after me. And yet you always do. You got me out of here. You took care of everything when we were on our own. Even since coming back...you\u0027ve always been the one who does all the work. Every time I break down - like last night - you\u0027re always there. Me, I\u0027m weak. I\u0027m not like you.\" I shook my head. \"That doesn\u0027t matter. It\u0027s what I do. I don\u0027t mind.\" \"Yeah, but look what happened. I\u0027m the one she really has a grudge against - even though I still don\u0027t know why. Whatever. It\u0027s going to stop. I\u0027m going to protect you from now on.\" There was a determination in her expression, a wonderful confidence radiating off of her that reminded me of the Lissa I\u0027d known before the accident. At the same time, I could feel something else in her - something darker, a sense of deeply buried anger. I\u0027d seen this side of her before too, and I didn\u0027t like it. I didn\u0027t want her tapping into it. I just wanted her to be safe. \"Lissa, you can\u0027t protect me.\" \"I can,\" she said fiercely. \"There\u0027s one thing Mia wants more than to destroy you and me. She wants to be accepted. She wants to hang out with the royals and feel like she\u0027s one of them. I can take that away from her.\" She smiled. \"I can turn them against her.\" \"How?\" \"By telling them.\" Her eyes flashed. My mind was moving too slowly tonight. It took me a while to catch on. \"Liss - no. You can\u0027t use compulsion. Not around here.\" \"I might as well get some use out of these stupid powers.\" The more she uses it, the worse it\u0027ll get. Stop her, Rose. Stop her before they notice, before they notice and take her away too. Get her out of here. \"Liss, if you get caught - \" Dimitri stuck his head out. \"You\u0027ve got to get back inside, Rose, before someone finds you.\" I shot a panicked look at Lissa, but she was already retreating. \"I\u0027ll take care of everything this time, Rose. Everything.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire-academy-vampire-academy-1/page-12.html","bookId":2060,"book":{"id":2060,"title":"Vampire Academy (Vampire Academy #1)","description":"Storyline: Vampire Academy Series 1: Vampire Academy After two years on the run, best friends Rose, half-human/half-vampire, and Lissa, a mortal vampire princess, are caught and returned to St. Vladimir\u0027s Academy. Up until then, Rose had kept Lissa safe from her enemies; school, however, brings both girls additional challenges and responsibilities. How they handle peer pressure, nasty gossip, new relationships, and anonymous threats may mean life or death. Likable narrator Rose hides doubts about her friend behind a tough exterior; orphan Lissa, while coping with difficult emotional issues such as depression and survivor\u0027s guilt, uses her emerging gifts for good. Mead\u0027s absorbing, debut YA novel, the first in a new series, blends intricately detailed fantasy with a contemporary setting, teen-relevant issues, and a diverse, if sometimes sterotyped, cast of supporting characters. Occasional steamy sex and a scattering of vulgar language demand mature readers, but teens able to handle the edgy elements will speed through this vamp story and anticipate the next installment.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/vampire-academy-vampire-academy-1.jpg","author":"Richelle Mead","type":"Fantasy","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/vampire-academy-vampire-academy-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:18 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:00:42 AM"}}
