My thoughts echoed hers.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re the only way,\" he said patiently. \"The only way to cure this disease. I\u0027ve been watching you for years, waiting until I was certain.\"\\n\\n Lissa shook her head. \"I can\u0027t...no. I can\u0027t do anything like that.\"\\n\\n \"Your healing powers are incredible. No one has any idea just how powerful.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about.\"\\n\\n \"Come now, Vasilisa. I know about the raven - Natalie saw you do it. She\u0027d been following you. And I know how you healed Rose.\"\\n\\n She realized the pointlessness of denying it. \"That...was different. Rose wasn\u0027t that hurt. But you...I can\u0027t do anything about Sandovsky\u0027s Syndrome.\"\\n\\n \"Not that hurt?\" he laughed. \"I\u0027m not talking about her ankle - which was still impressive. I\u0027m talking about the car accident. Because you\u0027re right, you know. Rose didn\u0027t get ¡®that hurt.\u0027 She died.\"\\n\\n He let the words sink in.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s...no. She lived,\" Lissa finally managed.\\n\\n \"No. Well, yes, she did. But I read all the reports. There was no way she should have survived - especially with so many injuries. You healed her. You brought her back.\" He sighed, half wistful and half weary. \"I\u0027d suspected you could do this for so long, and I tried so hard to repeat it...to see how much you could control...\"\\n\\n Lissa caught on and gasped. \"The animals. It was you.\"\\n\\n \"With Natalie\u0027s help.\"\\n\\n \"Why would you do that? How could you?\"\\n\\n \"Because I had to know. I have only a few more weeks to live, Vasilisa. If you can truly bring back the dead, then you can cure Sandovsky\u0027s. I had to know before I took you away that you could heal at will and not just in moments of panic.\"\\n\\n \"Why take me at all?\" A spark of anger flared up in her. \"You\u0027re my near-uncle. If you wanted me to do this - if you really think I can...\" Her voice and feelings showed me she didn\u0027t really entirely believe she could heal him. \"Then why kidnap me? Why didn\u0027t you just ask?\"\\n\\n \"Because it\u0027s not a onetime affair. It took a long time to figure out what you are, but I managed to acquire some of the old histories...scrolls kept out of Moroi museums. When I read about how wielding spirit works - \"\\n\\n \"Wielding what?\"\\n\\n \"Spirit. It\u0027s what you\u0027ve specialized in.\"\\n\\n \"I haven\u0027t specialized in anything! You\u0027re crazy.\"\\n\\n \"Where else do you think these powers of yours have come from? Spirit is another element, one few people have any more.\"\\n\\n Lissa\u0027s mind was still reeling from the kidnapping and the possible truth that she\u0027d brought me back from the dead. \"That doesn\u0027t make any sense. Even if it wasn\u0027t common, I still would have heard of another element! Or of someone having it.\"\\n\\n \"No one knows about spirit anymore. It\u0027s been forgotten. When people do specialize in it, nobody realizes it. They think the person simply hasn\u0027t specialized at all.\"\\n\\n \"Look, if you\u0027re just trying to make me feel - \" She abruptly cut herself off. She was angry and afraid, but behind those emotions, her higher reasoning had been processing what he\u0027d said about spirit users and specializing. It now caught up with her. \"Oh my God. Vladimir and Ms. Karp.\"\\n\\n He gave her a knowing look. \"You\u0027ve known about this all along.\"\\n\\n \"No! I swear. It\u0027s just something Rose was looking into...She said they were like me...\" Lissa was starting to change from a little scared to all scared. The news was too shocking.\\n\\n \"They are like you. The books even say Vladimir was ¡®full of spirit.\u0027 \" Victor seemed to find that funny. Seeing that smile made me want to slap him.\\n\\n \"I thought...\" Lissa still wanted him to be wrong. The idea of not specializing was safer than specializing in some freakish element. \"I thought that meant, like, the Holy Spirit.\"\\n\\n \"So does everyone else, but no. It\u0027s something else entirely. An element that\u0027s within all of us. A master element that can give you indirect control over the others.\" Apparently my theory about her specializing in all the elements wasn\u0027t so far off.\\n\\n She worked hard to get a grip on this news and her own self-control. \"That doesn\u0027t answer my question. It doesn\u0027t matter if I have this spirit thing or whatever. You didn\u0027t have to kidnap me.\"\\n\\n \"Spirit, as you\u0027ve seen, can heal physical injuries. Unfortunately, it\u0027s only good on acute injuries. Onetime things. Rose\u0027s ankle. The accident wounds. For something chronic - say, a genetic disease like Sandovsky\u0027s - continual healings are required. Otherwise it will keep coming back. That\u0027s what would happen to me. I need you, Vasilisa. I need you to help me fight this and keep it away. So I can live.\"\\n\\n \"That still doesn\u0027t explain why you took me,\" she argued. \"I would have helped you if you\u0027d asked.\"\\n\\n \"They never would have let you do it. The school. The council. Once they got over the shock of finding a spirit user, they\u0027d get hung up on ethics. After all, how does one choose who gets to be healed? They\u0027d say it wasn\u0027t fair. That it was like playing God. Or else they\u0027d worry about the toll it\u0027d take on you.\"\\n\\n She flinched, knowing exactly what toll he referred to.\\n\\n Seeing her expression, he nodded. \"Yes. I won\u0027t lie to you. It will be hard. It will exhaust you - mentally and physically. But I must do it. I am sorry. You\u0027ll be provided with feeders and other entertainments for your services.\"\\n\\n She leapt from the chair. Ben immediately stepped forward and pushed her back into it. \"And then what? Are you going to just make me a prisoner here? Your own private nurse?\"\\n\\n He made that annoying open-palmed gesture again. \"I\u0027m sorry. I have no choice.\"\\n\\n White-hot anger blasted away the fear inside of her. She spoke in a low voice. \"Yes. You don\u0027t have the choice, because this is me we\u0027re talking about.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s better for you this way. You know how the others turned out. How Vladimir spent the last of his days stark, raving mad. How Sonya Karp had to be taken away. The trauma you\u0027ve experienced since the accident comes from more than just your family\u0027s loss. It\u0027s from using spirit. The accident woke the spirit in you; your fear over seeing Rose dead made it burst out, allowing you to heal her. It forged your bond. And once it\u0027s out, you can\u0027t put it back. It\u0027s a powerful element - but it\u0027s also dangerous. Earth users get their power from the earth, air users from the air. But spirit? Where do you think that comes from?\"\\n\\n She glared.\\n\\n \"It comes from you, from your own essence. To heal another, you must give part of yourself. The more you do that, the more it will destroy you over time. You must be noticing that already. I\u0027ve seen how much certain things upset you, how fragile you are.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not fragile,\" snapped Lissa. \"And I\u0027m not going to go crazy. I\u0027m going to stop using spirit before things get worse.\"\\n\\n He smiled. \"Stop using it? You might as well stop breathing. Spirit has its own agenda...You\u0027ll always have the urge to help and heal. It\u0027s part of you. You resisted the animals, but you didn\u0027t think twice about helping Rose. You can\u0027t even help compulsion - which spirit also gives you special strength in. And that\u0027s how it will always be. You can\u0027t avoid spirit. Better to stay here, in isolation, away from further sources of stress. You\u0027d either have become increasingly unstable at the Academy, or they would have put you on some pill that would have made you feel better but stunted your power.\"\\n\\n A calm core of confidence settled inside her, one very different from what I\u0027d observed over the last couple of years. \"I love you, Uncle Victor, but I\u0027m the one who has to deal with that and decide what to do. Not you. You\u0027re making me give up my life for yours. That\u0027s not fair.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a matter of which life means more. I love you too. Very much. But the Moroi are falling apart. Our numbers are dropping as we let the Strigoi prey upon us. We used to actively seek them out. Now Tatiana and the other leaders hide away. They keep you and your peers isolated. In the old days, you were trained to fight alongside your guardians! You were taught to use magic as a weapon. Not any longer. We wait. We are victims.\" As he stared off, both Lissa and I could see how caught up in his passion he was. \"I would have changed that if I were king. I would have brought about a revolution the likes of which neither Moroi nor Strigoi have ever seen. I should have been Tatiana\u0027s heir. She was ready to name me before they discovered the disease, and then she would not. If I were cured...if I were cured, I could take my rightful place...\"\\n\\n His words triggered something inside of Lissa, a sudden consideration for the state of the Moroi. She\u0027d never contemplated what he\u0027d said, about how different it might be if Moroi and their guardians fought side by side to rid the world of the Strigoi and their evil. It reminded her of Christian and what he\u0027d said about using magic as a weapon too. But even if she did appreciate Victor\u0027s convictions, neither of us thought it was worth what he wanted her to do.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" she whispered. \"I\u0027m sorry for you. But please don\u0027t make me do this.\"\\n\\n \"I have to.\"\\n\\n She looked him straight in the eye. \"I won\u0027t do it.\"\\n\\n He inclined his head, and someone stepped forward from the corner. Another Moroi. No one I knew. Walking around behind Lissa, he untied her hands.\\n\\n \"This is Kenneth.\" Victor held his hands out toward her free ones. \"Please, Vasilisa. Take my hands. Send the magic through me just as you did with Rose.\"\\n\\n She shook her head. \"No.\"\\n\\n His voice was less kindly when he spoke again. \"Please. One way or another, you will heal me. I\u0027d rather it be on your terms, not ours.\"\\n\\n She shook her head again. He made a slight gesture toward Kenneth.\\n\\n And that\u0027s when the pain started.\\n\\n Lissa screamed. I screamed.\\n\\n In the SUV, Dimitri\u0027s grip on the wheel jerked in surprise, making us veer. Casting me an alarmed look, he started to pull over.\\n\\n \"No, no! Keep going!\" I pressed my palms to my temples. \"We have to get there!\"\\n\\n From behind my seat, Alberta reached forward and rested a hand on my shoulder. \"Rose, what\u0027s happening?\"\\n\\n I blinked back tears. \"They\u0027re torturing her...with air. This guy...Kenneth...he\u0027s making it press against her...into her head. The pressure\u0027s insane. It feels like my - her - skull\u0027s gonna explode.\" I started sobbing.\\n\\n Dimitri looked at me out of the corner of his eye and pressed the gas pedal down harder.\\n\\n Kenneth didn\u0027t stop with just the physical force of air. He also used it to affect her breathing. Sometimes he\u0027d smother her with it; other times he\u0027d take it all away and leave her gasping. After enduring all that firsthand - and it was bad enough secondhand - I felt pretty confident I would have done anything they wanted.\\n\\n And finally, she did.\\n\\n Hurting and bleary-eyed, Lissa took Victor\u0027s hands. I\u0027d never been in her head when she worked magic and didn\u0027t know what to expect. At first, I felt nothing. Just a sense of concentration. Then...it was like...I don\u0027t even know how to describe it. Color and light and music and life and joy and love...so many wonderful things, all the lovely things that make up the world and make it worth living in.\\n\\n Lissa summoned up all of those things, as many as she could, and sent them into Victor. The magic flowed through both of us, brilliant and sweet. It was alive. It was her life. And as wonderful as it all felt, she was growing weaker and weaker. But as all of those elements - bound by the mysterious spirit element - flowed into Victor, he grew stronger and stronger.\\n\\n The change was startling. His skin smoothed, no longer wrinkled and pocked. The gray thinning hair filled out, turning dark and lustrous once more. The green eyes - still jadelike - sparkled again, turning alert and lively.\\n\\n He\u0027d become the Victor she remembered from her childhood.\\n\\n Exhausted, Lissa passed out.\\n\\n In the SUV, I tried to relate what was happening. Dimitri\u0027s face grew darker and darker, and he spat out a string of Russian swear words he still hadn\u0027t taught me the meanings of.\\n\\n When we were a quarter mile from the cabin, Alberta made a call on her cell phone, and our whole convoy pulled over. All of the guardians - more than a dozen-got out and stood huddled, planning strategy. Someone went ahead to scout and returned with a report on the number of people inside and outside of the cabin. When the group seemed ready to disperse, I started to get out of the car. Dimitri stopped me.\\n\\n \"No, Roza. You stay here.\"\\n\\n \"The hell with that. I have to go help her.\"\\n\\n He cupped my chin with his hands, fixing me with his eyes. \"You have helped her. Your job is done. You did it well. But this isn\u0027t any place for you. She and I both need you to stay safe.\"\\n\\n Only the realization that arguing would delay the rescue kept me quiet. Swallowing back any protests, I nodded. He nodded back and joined the others. All of them slipped off into the woods, blending with the trees.\\n\\n Sighing, I kicked the passenger seat back and lay down. I was so tired. Even though the sun poured through the windshield, it was night for me. I\u0027d been up for most of it, and a lot had happened in that time. Between the adrenaline of my own role and sharing Lissa\u0027s pain, I could have passed out just like she had.\\n\\n Except that she was awake now.\\n\\n Slowly, her perceptions dominated mine once more. She lay on a couch in the cabin. One of Victor\u0027s henchmen must have carried her there after she\u0027d fainted. Victor himself - alive and well now, thanks to his abuse of her - stood in the kitchen with the others as they all spoke in low voices about their plans. Only one stood near Lissa, keeping watch. He\u0027d be easy to take down when Dimitri and the Badass Team burst inside.\\n\\n Lissa studied the lone guardian and then glanced at a window beside the couch. Still dizzy from the healing, she managed to sit up. The guardian turned around, watching her warily. She met his eyes and smiled.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re going to stay quiet no matter what I do,\" she told him. \"You aren\u0027t going to call for help or tell anyone when I leave. Okay?\"\\n\\n The thrall of compulsion slid over him. He nodded in agreement.\\n\\n Moving toward the window, she unlocked it and slid the glass up. As she did, a tumble of considerations played through her mind. She was weak. She didn\u0027t know how far from the Academy - from anything, really - she was. She had no clue how far she could get before someone noticed.\\n\\n But she also knew she might not get another chance at escape. She had no intention of spending the rest of her life in this cabin in the woods.\\n\\n At any other time, I would have cheered on her boldness, but not this time. Not when all those guardians were about to save her. She needed to stay put. Unfortunately, she couldn\u0027t hear my advice.\\n\\n Lissa climbed out the window, and I swore out loud.\\n\\n \"What? What\u0027d you see?\" asked a voice behind me.\\n\\n I jerked up from my reclining position in the car, banging my head on the ceiling. Glancing behind me, I found Christian peering up from the cargo space behind the farthest backseats.\\n\\n \"What are you doing here?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s it look like? I\u0027m a stowaway.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t you have a concussion or something?\"\\n\\n He shrugged like it didn\u0027t matter. What a great pair he and Lissa were. Neither afraid to take on crazy feats while seriously injured. Still, if Kirova had made me stay behind, I would have been right beside him in the back.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s happening?\" he asked. \"Did you see something new?\\n\\n Hastily, I told him. I also got out of the car as I spoke. He followed.\\n\\n \"She doesn\u0027t know our guys are already coming for her. I\u0027m going to go get her before she kills herself with exhaustion.\"\\n\\n \"What about the guardians? The school\u0027s, I mean. Are you going to tell them she\u0027s gone?\"\\n\\n I shook my head. \"They\u0027re probably already busting down the cabin\u0027s door. I\u0027m going after her.\" She was somewhere off to the right side of the cabin. I could head in that direction but wouldn\u0027t be able to get very precise until I was much closer to her. Still, it didn\u0027t matter. I had to find her. Seeing Christian\u0027s face, I couldn\u0027t resist giving him a dry smile. \"And yeah, I know. You\u0027re going with me.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire-academy-vampire-academy-1/page-22.html","bookId":2060,"book":{"id":2060,"title":"Vampire Academy (Vampire Academy #1)","description":"Storyline: Vampire Academy Series 1: Vampire Academy \\n After two years on the run, best friends Rose, half-human/half-vampire, and Lissa, a mortal vampire princess, are caught and returned to St. Vladimir\u0027s Academy. Up until then, Rose had kept Lissa safe from her enemies; school, however, brings both girls additional challenges and responsibilities. How they handle peer pressure, nasty gossip, new relationships, and anonymous threats may mean life or death. Likable narrator Rose hides doubts about her friend behind a tough exterior; orphan Lissa, while coping with difficult emotional issues such as depression and survivor\u0027s guilt, uses her emerging gifts for good. Mead\u0027s absorbing, debut YA novel, the first in a new series, blends intricately detailed fantasy with a contemporary setting, teen-relevant issues, and a diverse, if sometimes sterotyped, cast of supporting characters. Occasional steamy sex and a scattering of vulgar language demand mature readers, but teens able to handle the edgy elements will speed through this vamp story and anticipate the next installment.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/vampire-academy-vampire-academy-1.jpg","author":"Richelle Mead","type":"Fantasy","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/vampire-academy-vampire-academy-1.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:18 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:00:42 AM"}}
