{"id":110552,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"FOUR\\n\\n WE DIDN\u0027T HAVE THE ENTIRE commons\u0027 attention this time, thank God, but a few passing people had stopped to stare.\\n\\n \"What the hell do you think you\u0027re doing?\" asked Doll Girl, blue eyes wide and sparkling with fury. Up close now, I was able to get a better look at her. She had the same slim build as most Moroi but not the usual height, which was partly what made her look so young. The tiny purple dress she wore was gorgeous - reminding me that I was indeed dressed in thrift-shop wear - but closer inspection led me to think it was a designer knockoff.\\n\\n I crossed my arms across my chest. \"Are you lost, little girl? The elementary school\u0027s over on west campus.\"\\n\\n A pink flush spread over her cheeks. \"Don\u0027t you ever touch me again. You screw with me, and I\u0027ll screw you right back.\"\\n\\n Oh man, what an opening that was. Only a head shake from Lissa stopped me from unleashing any number of hilarious comebacks. Instead, I opted for simple brute force, so to speak.\\n\\n \"And if you mess with either of us again, I\u0027ll break you in half. If you don\u0027t believe me, go ask Dawn Yarrow about what I did to her arm in ninth grade. You were probably at nap time when it happened.\"\\n\\n The incident with Dawn hadn\u0027t been one of my finer moments. I honestly hadn\u0027t expected to break any bones when I shoved her into a tree. Still, the incident had given me a dangerous reputation, in addition to my smartass one. The story had gained legendary status, and I liked to imagine that it was still being told around campfires late at night. Judging from the look on this girl\u0027s face, it was.\\n\\n One of the patrolling staff members strolled by right then, casting suspicious eyes at our little meeting. Doll Girl backed off, taking Aaron\u0027s arm. \"Come on,\" she said.\\n\\n \"Hey, Aaron,\" I said cheerfully, remembering he was there. \"Nice to see you again.\"\\n\\n He gave me a quick nod and an uneasy smile, just as the girl dragged him off. Same old Aaron. He might be nice and cute, but aggressive he was not.\\n\\n I turned to Lissa. \"You okay?\" She nodded. \"Any idea who I just threatened to beat up?\"\\n\\n \"Not a clue.\" I started to lead her toward the lunch line, but she shook her head at me. \"Gotta go see the feeders.\"\\n\\n A funny feeling settled over me. I\u0027d gotten so used to being her primary blood source that the thought of returning to the Moroi\u0027s normal routine seemed strange. In fact, it almost bothered me. It shouldn\u0027t have. Daily feedings were part of a Moroi\u0027s life, something I hadn\u0027t been able to offer her while living on our own. It had been an inconvenient situation, one that left me weak on feeding days and her weak on the days in between. I should have been happy she would get some normality.\\n\\n I forced a smile. \"Sure.\"\\n\\n We walked into the feeding room, which sat adjacent to the cafeteria. It was set up with small cubicles, dividing the room\u0027s space in an effort to offer privacy. A dark-haired Moroi woman greeted us at the entrance and glanced down at her clipboard, flipping through the pages. Finding what she needed, she made a few notes and then gestured for Lissa to follow. Me she gave a puzzled look, but she didn\u0027t stop me from entering.\\n\\n She led us to one of the cubicles where a plump, middle-aged woman sat leafing through a magazine. She looked up at our approach and smiled. In her eyes, I could see the dreamy, glazed-over look most feeders had. She\u0027d probably neared her quota for the day, judging from how high she appeared to be.\\n\\n Recognizing Lissa, her smile grew. \"Welcome back, Princess.\"\\n\\n The greeter left us, and Lissa sat down in the chair beside the woman. I sensed a feeling of discomfort in her, a little different from my own. This was weird for her too; it had been a long time. The feeder, however, had no such reservations. An eager look crossed her face - the look of a junkie about to get her next fix.\\n\\n Disgust poured into me. It was an old instinct, one that had been drilled in over the years. Feeders were essential to Moroi life. They were humans who willingly volunteered to be a regular blood source, humans from the fringes of society who gave their lives over to the secret world of the Moroi. They were well cared for and given all the comforts they could need. But at the heart of it, they were drug users, addicts to Moroi saliva and the rush it offered with each bite. The Moroi - and guardians - looked down on this dependency, even though the Moroi couldn\u0027t have survived otherwise unless they took victims by force. Hypocrisy at its finest.\\n\\n The feeder tilted her head, giving Lissa full access to her neck. Her skin there was marked with scars from years of daily bites. The infrequent feedings Lissa and I had done had kept my neck clear; my bite marks never lasted more than a day or so.\\n\\n Lissa leaned forward, fangs biting into the feeder\u0027s yielding flesh. The woman closed her eyes, making a soft sound of pleasure. I swallowed, watching Lissa drink. I couldn\u0027t see any blood, but I could imagine it. A surge of emotion grew in my chest: longing. Jealousy. I averted my eyes, staring at the floor. Mentally, I scolded myself.\\n\\n What\u0027s wrong with you? Why should you miss it? You only did it once every day. You aren\u0027t addicted, not like this. And you don\u0027t want to be.\\n\\n But I couldn\u0027t help myself, couldn\u0027t help the way I felt as I recalled the bliss and rush of a vampire\u0027s bite.\\n\\n Lissa finished and we returned to the commons, moving toward the lunch line. It was short, since we only had fifteen minutes left, and I strolled up and began to load my plate with french fries and some rounded, bite-size objects that looked vaguely like chicken nuggets. Lissa only grabbed a yogurt. Moroi needed food, as dhampirs and humans did, but rarely had an appetite after drinking blood.\\n\\n \"So how\u0027d classes go?\" I asked.\\n\\n She shrugged. Her face was bright with color and life now. \"Okay. Lots of stares. A lot of stares. Lots of questions about where we were. Whispering.\"\\n\\n \"Same here,\" I said. The attendant checked us out, and we walked toward the tables. I gave Lissa a sidelong glance. \"You okay with that? They aren\u0027t bothering you, are they?\"\\n\\n \"No - it\u0027s fine.\" The emotions coming through the bond contradicted her words. Knowing I could feel that, she tried to change the subject by handing me her class schedule. I looked it over.\\n\\n 1st Period Russian 2\\n\\n 2nd Period American Colonial Literature\\n\\n 3rd Period Basics of Elemental Control\\n\\n 4th Period Ancient Poetry\\n\\n -Lunch -\\n\\n 5th Period Animal Behavior and Physiology\\n\\n 6th Period Advanced Calculus\\n\\n 7th Period Moroi Culture 4\\n\\n 8th Period Slavic Art\\n\\n \"Nerd,\" I said. \"If you were in Stupid Math like me, we\u0027d have the same afternoon schedule.\" I stopped walking. \"Why are you in elemental basics? That\u0027s a sophomore class.\"\\n\\n She eyed me. \"Because seniors take specialized classes.\"\\n\\n We fell silent at that. All Moroi wielded elemental magic. It was one of the things that differentiated living vampires from Strigoi, the dead vampires. Moroi viewed magic as a gift. It was part of their souls and connected them to the world.\\n\\n A long time ago, they had used their magic openly - averting natural disasters and helping with things like food and water production. They didn\u0027t need to do that as much anymore, but the magic was still in their blood. It burned in them and made them want to reach out to the earth and wield their power. Academies like this existed to help Moroi control the magic and learn how to do increasingly complex things with it. Students also had to learn the rules that surrounded magic, rules that had been in place for centuries and were strictly enforced.\\n\\n All Moroi had a small ability in each element. When they got to be around our age, students \"specialized\" when one element grew stronger than the others: earth, water, fire, or air. Not specializing was like not going through puberty.\\n\\n And Lissa¡well, Lissa hadn\u0027t specialized yet.\\n\\n \"Is Ms. Carmack still teaching that? What she\u0027d say?\"\\n\\n \"She says she\u0027s not worried. She thinks it\u0027ll come.\"\\n\\n \"Did you - did you tell her about - \"\\n\\n Lissa shook her head. \"No. Of course not.\"\\n\\n We let the subject drop. It was one we thought about a lot but rarely spoke of.\\n\\n We started moving again, scanning the tables as we decided where to sit. A few pairs of eyes looked up at us with blatant curiosity.\\n\\n \"Lissa!\" came a nearby voice. Glancing over, we saw Natalie waving at us. Lissa and I exchanged looks. Natalie was sort of Lissa\u0027s cousin in the way Victor was sort of her uncle, but we\u0027d never hung out with her all that much.\\n\\n Lissa shrugged and headed in that direction. \"Why not?\"\\n\\n I followed reluctantly. Natalie was nice but also one of the most uninteresting people I knew. Most royals at the school enjoyed a kind of celebrity status, but Natalie had never fit in with that crowd. She was too plain, too uninterested in the politics of the Academy, and too clueless to really navigate them anyway.\\n\\n Natalie\u0027s friends eyed us with a quiet curiosity, but she didn\u0027t hold back. She threw her arms around us. Like Lissa, she had jade-green eyes, but her hair was jet black, like Victor\u0027s had been before his disease grayed it.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re back! I knew you would be! Everyone said you were gone forever, but I never believed that. I knew you couldn\u0027t stay away. Why\u0027d you go? There are so many stories about why you left!\" Lissa and I exchanged glances as Natalie prattled on. \"Camille said one of you got pregnant and went off to have an abortion, but I knew that couldn\u0027t be true. Someone else said you went off to hang out with Rose\u0027s mom, but I figured Ms. Kirova and Daddy wouldn\u0027t have been so upset if you\u0027d turned up there. Did you know we might get to be roommates? I was talking to¡\"\\n\\n On and on she chatted, flashing her fangs as she spoke. I smiled politely, letting Lissa deal with the onslaught until Natalie asked a dangerous question.\\n\\n \"What\u0027d you do for blood, Lissa?\"\\n\\n The table regarded us questioningly. Lissa froze, but I immediately jumped in, the lie coming effortlessly to my lips.\\n\\n \"Oh, it\u0027s easy. There are a lot of humans who want to do it.\"\\n\\n \"Really?\" asked one of Natalie\u0027s friends, wide-eyed.\\n\\n \"Yup. You find ¡®em at parties and stuff. They\u0027re all looking for a fix from something, and they don\u0027t really get that a vampire\u0027s doing it: most are already so wasted they don\u0027t remember anyway.\" My already vague details dried up, so I simply shrugged in as cool and confident a way as I could manage. It wasn\u0027t like any of them knew any better. \"Like I said, it\u0027s easy. Almost easier than with our own feeders.\"\\n\\n Natalie accepted this and than launched into some other topic. Lissa shot me a grateful look.\\n\\n Ignoring the conversation again, I took in the old faces, trying to figure out who was hanging out with whom and how power had shifted within the school. Mason, sitting with a group of novices, caught my eye, and I smiled. Near him, a group of Moroi royals sat, laughing over something. Aaron and the blond girl sat there too.\\n\\n \"Hey, Natalie,\" I said, turning around and cutting her off. She didn\u0027t seem to notice or mind. \"Who\u0027s Aaron\u0027s new girlfriend?\"\\n\\n \"Huh? Oh. Mia Rinaldi.\" Seeing my blank look, she asked, \"Don\u0027t you remember her?\"\\n\\n \"Should I? Was she here when we left?\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027s always been here,\" said Natalie. \"She\u0027s only a year younger than us.\"\\n\\n I shot a questioning look at Lissa, who only shrugged.\\n\\n \"Why is she so pissed off at us?\" I asked. \"Neither of us know her.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" answered Natalie. \"Maybe she\u0027s jealous about Aaron. She wasn\u0027t much of anybody when you guys left. She got really popular really fast. She isn\u0027t royal or anything, but once she started dating Aaron, she - \"\\n\\n \"Okay, thanks,\" I interrupted. \"It doesn\u0027t really - \"\\n\\n My eyes lifted up from Natalie\u0027s face to Jesse Zeklos\u0027s, just as he passed by our table. Ah, Jesse. I\u0027d forgotten about him. I liked flirting with Mason and some of the other novices, but Jesse was in an entirely different category. You flirted with the other guys simply for the sake of flirting. You flirted with Jesse in the hopes of getting semi-naked with him. He was a royal Moroi, and he was so hot, he should have worn a warning: flammable sign. He met my eyes and grinned.\\n\\n \"Hey Rose, welcome back. You still breaking hearts?\"\\n\\n \"Are you volunteering?\"\\n\\n His grin widened. \"Let\u0027s hang out sometime and find out. If you ever get parole.\"\\n\\n He kept walking, and I watched him admiringly. Natalie and her friends stared at me in awe. I might not be a god in the Dimitri sense, but with this group, Lissa and I were gods - or at least former gods - of another nature.\\n\\n \"Oh my gawd,\" exclaimed one girl. I didn\u0027t remember her name. \"That was Jesse.\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" I said, smiling. \"It certainly was.\"\\n\\n \"I wish I looked like you,\" she added with a sigh.\\n\\n Their eyes fell on me. Technically, I was half-Moroi, but my looks were human. I\u0027d blended in well with humans during our time away, so much so that I\u0027d barely thought about my appearance at all. Here, among the slim and small-chested Moroi girls, certain features - meaning my larger breasts and more defined hips - stood out. I knew I was pretty, but to Moroi boys, my body was more than just pretty: it was sexy in a risqu¨¦ way. Dhampirs were an exotic conquest, a novelty all Moroi guys wanted to \"try.\"\\n\\n It was ironic that dhampirs had such an allure here, because slender Moroi girls looked very much like the super-skinny runway models so popular in the human world. Most humans could never reach that \"ideal\" skinniness, just as Moroi girls could never look like me. Everyone wanted what she couldn\u0027t have.\\n\\n Lissa and I got to sit together in our shared afternoon classes but didn\u0027t do much talking. The stares she\u0027d mentioned certainly did follow us, but I found that the more I talked to people, the more they warmed up. Slowly, gradually, they seemed to remember who we were, and the novelty - though not the intrigue - of our crazy stunt wore off.\\n\\n Or maybe I should say, they remembered who I was. Because I was the only one talking. Lissa stared straight ahead, listening but neither acknowledging nor participating in my attempts at conversation. I could feel anxiety and sadness pouring out of her.\\n\\n \"All right,\" I told her when classes finally ended. We stood outside the school, and I was fully aware that in doing so, I was already breaking the terms of my agreement with Kirova. \"We\u0027re not staying here,\" I told her, looking around the campus uneasily. \"I\u0027m going to find a way to get us out.\"\\n\\n \"You think we could really do it a second time?\" Lissa asked quietly.\\n\\n \"Absolutely.\" I spoke with certainty, again relieved she couldn\u0027t read my feelings. Escaping the first time had been tricky enough. Doing it again would be a real bitch, not that I couldn\u0027t still find a way.\\n\\n \"You really would, wouldn\u0027t you?\" She smiled, more to herself than to me, like she\u0027d thought of something funny. \"Of course you would. It\u0027s just, well¡\" She sighed. \"I don\u0027t know if we should go. Maybe - maybe we should stay.\"\\n\\n I blinked in astonishment. \"What?\" Not one of my more eloquent answers, but the best I could manage. I\u0027d never expected this from her.\\n\\n \"I saw you, Rose. I saw you talking to the other novices during class, talking about practice. You miss that.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not worth it,\" I argued. \"Not if¡not if you¡\" I couldn\u0027t finish, but she was right. She\u0027d read me. I had missed the other novices. Even some of the Moroi. But there was more to it than just that. The weight of my inexperience, how much I\u0027d fallen behind, had been growing all day.\\n\\n \"It might be better,\" she countered. \"I haven\u0027t had as many¡you know, things happening in a while. I haven\u0027t felt like anyone was following or watching us.\"\\n\\n I didn\u0027t say anything to that. Before we\u0027d left the Academy, she\u0027d always felt like someone was following her, like she was being hunted. I\u0027d never seen evidence to support that, but I had once heard one of our teachers go on and on about the same sort of thing. Ms. Karp. She\u0027d been a pretty Moroi, with deep auburn air and high cheekbones. And I was pretty sure she\u0027d been crazy.\\n\\n \"You never know who\u0027s watching,\" she used to say, walking briskly around the classroom as she shut all the blinds. \"Or who\u0027s following you. Best to be safe. Best to always be safe.\" We\u0027d snickered amongst ourselves because that\u0027s what students do around eccentric and paranoid teachers. The thought of Lissa acting like her bothered me.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s wrong?\" Lissa asked, noticing that I was lost in thought.\\n\\n \"Huh? Nothing. Just thinking.\" I sighed, trying to balance my own wants with what was best for her. \"Liss, we can stay, I guess¡but there are a few conditions.\"\\n\\n This made her laugh. \"A Rose ultimatum, huh?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m serious.\" Words I didn\u0027t say very much. \"I want you to stay away from the royals. Not like Natalie or anything but you know, the others. The power players. Camille. Carly. That group.\"\\n\\n Her amusement turned to astonishment. \"Are you serious?\"\\n\\n \"Sure. You never liked them anyway.\"\\n\\n \"You did.\"\\n\\n \"No. Not really. I liked what they could offer. All the parties and stuff.\"\\n\\n \"And you can go without that now?\" She looked skeptical.\\n\\n \"Sure. We did in Portland.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, but that was different.\" Her eyes stared off, not really focused on any one thing. \"Here¡here I\u0027ve got to be a part of that. I can\u0027t avoid it.\"\\n\\n \"The hell you do. Natalie stays out of that stuff.\"\\n\\n \"Natalie isn\u0027t going to inherit her family\u0027s title,\" she retorted. \"I\u0027ve already got it. I\u0027ve got to be involved, start making connections. Andre - \"\\n\\n \"Liss,\" I groaned. \"You aren\u0027t Andre.\" I couldn\u0027t believe she was still comparing herself to her brother.\\n\\n \"He was always involved in all that stuff.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, well,\" I snapped back, \"he\u0027s dead now.\"\\n\\n Her face hardened. \"You know, sometimes you aren\u0027t very nice.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t keep me around to be nice. You want nice, there are a dozen sheep in there who would rip each other\u0027s throats to get in good with the Dragomir princess. You keep me around to tell you the truth, and here it is: Andre\u0027s dead. You\u0027re the heir now, and you\u0027re going to deal with it however you can. But for now, that means staying away from the other royals. We\u0027ll just lie low. Coast through the middle. Get involved in that stuff again, Liss, and you\u0027ll drive yourself¡\"\\n\\n \"Crazy?\" she supplied when I didn\u0027t finish.\\n\\n Now I looked away. \"I didn\u0027t mean¡\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s okay.\" she said, after a moment. She sighed and touched my arm. \"Fine. We\u0027ll stay and we\u0027ll keep out of all that stuff. We\u0027ll ¡®coast through the middle\u0027 like you want. Hang out with Natalie, I guess.\"\\n\\n To be perfectly honest, I didn\u0027t want any of that. I wanted to go to all the royal parties and wild drunken festivities like we\u0027d done before. We\u0027d kept out of that life for years until Lissa\u0027s parents and brother died. Andre should have been the one to inherit her family\u0027s title, and he\u0027d certainly acted like it. Handsome and outgoing, he\u0027d charmed everyone he knew and had been a leader in all the royal cliques and clubs that existed on campus. After his death, Lissa had felt it was her family duty to take his place.\\n\\n I\u0027d gotten to join that world with her. It was easy for me, because I didn\u0027t really have to deal with the politics of it. I was a pretty dhampir, one who didn\u0027t mind getting into trouble and pulling crazy stunts. I became a novelty; they liked having me around for the fun of it.\\n\\n Lissa had to deal with other matters. The Dragomirs were one of the twelve ruling families. She\u0027d have a very powerful place in Moroi society, and the other young royals wanted to get in good with her. Fake friends tried to schmooze her and get her to team up against other people. The royals could bribe and backstab in the same breath - and that was just with each other. To dhampirs and non-royals, they were completely unpredictable.\\n\\n That cruel culture had eventually taken its toll on Lissa. She had an open, kind nature, one that I loved, and I hated to see her upset and stressed by royal games. She\u0027d grown fragile since the accident, and all the parties in the world weren\u0027t worth seeing her hurt.\\n\\n \"All right then,\" I said finally. \"We\u0027ll see how this goes. If anything goes wrong - anything at all - we leave. No arguments.\"\\n\\n She nodded.\\n\\n \"Rose?\"\\n\\n We both looked up at Dimitri\u0027s looming form. I hoped he hadn\u0027t heard the part about us leaving.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re late for practice,\" he said evenly. Seeing Lissa, he gave a polite nod. \"Princess.\"\\n\\n As he and I walked away, I worried about Lissa and wondered if staying here was the right thing to do. I felt nothing alarming through the bond, but her emotions spiked all over the place. Confusion. Nostalgia. Fear. Anticipation. Strong and powerful, they flooded into me.\\n\\n I felt the pull just before it happened. It was exactly like what had happened on the plane: her emotions grew so strong that they \"sucked\" me into her head before I could stop them. I could now see and feel what she did.\\n\\n She walked slowly around the commons, toward the small Russian Orthodox chapel that served most of the school\u0027s religious needs. Lissa had always attended mass regularly. Not me.\\n\\n I had a standing arrangement with God: I\u0027d agree to believe in him - barely - so long as he let me sleep in on Sundays.\\n\\n But as she went inside, I could feel that she wasn\u0027t there to pray. She had another purpose, one I didn\u0027t know about. Glancing around, she verified that neither the priest nor any worshippers were close by. The place was empty.\\n\\n Slipping through a doorway in the back of the chapel, she climbed a narrow set of creaky stairs up into the attic. Here it was dark and dusty. The only light came through a large stained-glass window that fractured the faint glow of sunrise into tiny, multicolored gems across the floor.\\n\\n I hadn\u0027t known until that moment that this room was a regular retreat for Lissa. But now I could feel it, feel her memories of how she used to escape here to be alone and to think. The anxiety in her ebbed away ever so slightly as she took in the familiar surroundings. She climbed up into the window seat and leaned her head back against its side, momentarily entranced by the silence and the light.\\n\\n Moroi could stand some sunlight, unlike the Strigoi, but they had to limit their exposure. Sitting here, she could almost pretend she was in the sun, protected by the glass\u0027s dilution of the rays.\\n\\n Breathe, just breathe, she told herself. It\u0027ll be okay. Rose will take care of everything.\\n\\n She believed that passionately, like always, and relaxed further.\\n\\n Then a low voice spoke from the darkness.\\n\\n \"You can have the Academy but not the window seat.\"\\n\\n She sprang up, heart pounding. I shared her anxiety, and my own pulse quickened. \"Who\u0027s there?\"\\n\\n A moment later, a shape rose from behind a stack of crates, just outside her field of vision. The figure stepped forward, and in the poor lighting, familiar features materialized. Messy black hair. Pale blue eyes. A perpetually sardonic smirk.\\n\\n Christian Ozera.\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t worry,\" he said. \"I won\u0027t bite. Well, at least not in the way you\u0027re afraid of.\" He chuckled at his own joke.\\n\\n She didn\u0027t find it funny. She had completely forgotten about Christian. So had I.\\n\\n No matter what happened in our world, a few basic truths about vampires remained the same. Moroi were alive; Strigoi were undead. Moroi were mortal; Strigoi were immortal. Moroi were born; Strigoi were made.\\n\\n And there were two ways to make a Strigoi. Strigoi could forcibly turn humans, dhampirs, or Moroi with a single bite. Moroi tempted by the promise of immortality could become Strigoi by choice if they purposely killed another person while feeding. Doing that was considered dark and twisted, the greatest of all sins, both against the Moroi way of life and nature itself. Moroi who chose this dark path lost their ability to connect with elemental magic and other powers of the world. That was why they could no longer go into the sun.\\n\\n This is what had happened to Christian\u0027s parents. They were Strigoi. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/vampire-academy-vampire-academy-1/page-4.html","bookId":2060,"book":{"id":2060,"title":"Vampire Academy (Vampire Academy #1)","description":"Storyline: Vampire Academy Series 1: Vampire Academy \\n After two years on the run, best friends Rose, half-human/half-vampire, and Lissa, a mortal vampire princess, are caught and returned to St. Vladimir\u0027s Academy.
