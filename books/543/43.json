{"id":32883,"no":43,"title":"Book 3 Chapter 14 The Knitting Done","content":"IN that same juncture of time when the Fifty-Two awaited their fate, Madame Defarge held darkly ominous council with The Vengeance and Jacques Three of the Revolutionary Jury. Not in the wine-shop did Madame Defarge confer with these ministers, but in the shed of the wood-sawyer, erst a mender of roads. The sawyer himself did not participate in the conference, but abided at a little distance, like an outer satellite who was not to speak until required, or to offer an opinion until invited. `But our Defarge,\u0027 said Jacques Three, `is undoubtedly a good Republican? Eh?\u0027 `There is no better,\u0027 the voluble Vengeance protested in her shrill notes, `in France. `Peace, little Vengeance,\u0027 said Madame Defarge, laying her hand with a slight frown on her lieutenant\u0027s lips, `hear me speak. My husband, fellow-citizen, is a good Republican and a bold man; he has deserved well of the Republic, and possesses its confidence. But my husband has his weaknesses, and he is so weak as to relent towards this Doctor.\u0027 `It is a great pity,\u0027 croaked Jacques Three, dubiously shaking his head, with his cruel fingers at his hungry mouth; `it is not quite like a good citizen; it is a thing to regret. `See you,\u0027 said madame, `I care nothing for this Doctor, I. He may wear his head or lose it, for any interest I have in him; it is all one to me. But, the Evrémonde people are to be exterminated, and the wife and child must follow the husband and father.\u0027 `She has a fine head for it,\u0027 croaked Jacques Three. `I have seen blue eyes and golden hair there, and they looked charming when Samson held them up.\u0027 Ogre that he was, he spoke like an epicure. Madame Defarge cast down her eyes, and reflected a little. `The child also,\u0027 observed Jacques Three, with a meditative enjoyment of his words, `has golden hair and blue eyes. And we seldom have a child there. It is a pretty sight!\u0027 `In a word,\u0027 said Madame Defarge, coming out of her short abstraction, `I cannot trust my husband in this matter. Not only do I feel, since last night, that I dare not confide to him the details of my projects; but also I feel that if I delay, there is danger of his giving warning, and then they might escape. `That must never be,\u0027 croaked Jacques Three; `no one must escape. We have not half enough as it is. We ought to have six score a day.\u0027 `In a word,\u0027 Madame Defarge went on, `my husband has not my reason for pursuing this family to annihilation, and I have not his reason for regarding this Doctor with any sensibility. I must act for myself, therefore. Come hither, little citizen. The wood-sawyer, who held her in the respect, and himself in the submission, of mortal fear, advanced with his hand to his red cap. `Touching those signals, little citizen,\u0027 said Madame Defarge, sternly, `that she made to the prisoners; you are ready to bear witness to them this very day?\u0027 `Ay, ay, why not!\u0027 cried the sawyer. `Every day, in all weathers, from two to four, always signalling, sometimes with the little one, sometimes without. I know what I know. I have seen with my eyes.\u0027 He made all manner of gestures while he spoke, as if in incidental imitation of some few of the great diversity of signals that he had never seen. `Clearly plots,\u0027 said Jacques Three. `Transparently!\u0027 `There is no doubt of the Jury?\u0027 inquired Madame Defarge, letting her eyes turn to him with a gloomy smile. `Rely upon the patriotic Jury, dear citizeness. I answer for my fellow-Jurymen.\u0027 `Now, let me see,\u0027 said Madame Defarge, pondering again. `Yet once more! Can I spare this Doctor to my husband? I have no feeling either way. Can I spare him?\u0027 `He would count as one head,\u0027 observed Jacques Three, in a low voice. `We really have not heads enough; it would be a pity, I think.\u0027 `He was signalling with her when I saw her,\u0027 argued Madame Defarge; `I cannot speak of one without the other; and I must not be silent, and trust the case wholly to him, this little citizen here. For, I am not a bad witness. The Vengeance and Jacques Three vied with each other in their fervent protestations that she was the most admirable and marvellous of witnesses. The little citizen, not to be outdone, declared her to be a celestial witness. He must take his chance,\u0027 said Madame Defarge. `No, I cannot spare him! You are engaged at three o\u0027clock; you are going to see the batch of to-day executed.--You?\u0027 The question was addressed to the wood-sawyer, who hurriedly replied in the affirmative: seizing the occasion to add that he was the most ardent of Republicans, and that he would be in effect the most desolate of Republicans, if anything prevented him from enjoying the pleasure of smoking his afternoon pipe in the contemplation of the droll national barber. He was so very demonstrative herein, that he might have been suspected (perhaps was, by the dark eyes that looked Contemptuously at him out of Madame Defarge\u0027s head) of having his small individual fears for his own personal safety, every hour in the day. `I,\u0027 said madame, `am equally engaged at the same place. After it is over-say at eight to-night--come you to me, in Saint Antoine, and we will give information against these\u0027 people at my section.\u0027 The wood-sawyer said he would be proud and flattered to attend the citizeness. The citizeness looking at him, he became embarrassed, evaded her glance as a small dog would have done, retreated among his wood, and hid his confusion over the handle of his saw. Madame Defarge beckoned the Juryman and The Vengeance a little nearer to the door, and there expounded her further views to them thus: `She will now be at home, awaiting the moment of his death. She will be mourning and grieving. She will be in a state of mind to impeach the justice of the Republic. She will be full of sympathy with its enemies. I will go to her.\u0027 `What an admirable woman; what an adorable woman!\u0027 exclaimed Jacques Three, rapturously. `Ah, my cherished!\u0027 cried The Vengeance; and embraced her. `Take you my knitting,\u0027 said Madame Defarge, placing it in her lieutenant\u0027s hands, `and have it ready for me in my usual seat. Keep me my usual chair. Go you there, straight, for there will probably be a greater concourse than usual, to-day.\u0027 `I willingly obey the orders of my Chief\u0027 said The Vengeance with alacrity, and kissing her cheek. `You will not be late?\u0027 `I shall be there before the commencement.\u0027 `And before the tumbrils arrive. Be sure you are there, my soul,\u0027 said The Vengeance, calling after her, for she had already turned into the street, `before the tumbrils arrive!\u0027 There were many women at that time, upon whom the time laid a dreadfully disfiguring hand; but, there was not one among them more to be dreaded than this ruthless woman, now taking her way along the streets. Of a strong and fearless character, of shrewd sense and readiness, of great determination, of that kind of beauty which not only seems to impart to its possessor firmness and animosity, but to strike into others an instinctive recognition of those qualities; the troubled time would have heaved her up, under any circumstances. But, imbued from her childhood with a brooding sense of, wrong, and an inveterate hatred of a class, opportunity had developed her into a tigress. She was absolutely without pity. If she had ever had the virtue in her, it had quite gone out of her. It was nothing to her, that an innocent man was to die for the sins of his forefathers; she saw, not him, but them. It was nothing to her, that his wife was to be made a widow and his daughter an orphan; that was insufficient punishment, because they were her natural enemies and her prey, and as such had no right to live. To appeal to her, was made hopeless by her having no sense of pity, even for herself. If she had been laid low in the streets, in any of the many encounters in which she had been engaged, she would not have pitied herself; nor, if she had been ordered to the axe to-morrow, would she have gone to it with any softer feeling than a fierce desire to change places with the man who sent her there. Such a heart Madame Defarge carried under her rough robe. Carelessly worn, it was a becoming robe enough, in a certain weird way, and her dark hair looked rich under her coarse red cap. Lying hidden in her bosom, was a loaded pistol. Lying hidden at her waist, was a sharpened dagger. Thus accoutred, and walking with the confident tread of such a character, and with the supple freedom of a woman who had habitually walked in her girlhood, bare-foot and bare-legged, on the brown sea-sand, Madame Defarge took her way along the streets. Seeing in this arrangement the hope of rendering real service in that pressing emergency, Miss Pross hailed it with joy. She and Jerry had beheld the coach start, had known who it was that Solomon brought, had passed some ten minutes in tortures of suspense, and were now concluding their arrangements to follow the coach, even as Madame Defarge, taking her way through the streets, now drew nearer and nearer to the else-deserted lodging in which they held their consultation. `Now what do you think, Mr. Cruncher,\u0027 said Miss Pross, whose agitation was so great that she could hardly speak, or stand, or move, or live: `what do you think of our not starting from this court-yard? Another carriage having already gone from here to-day, it might awaken suspicion. `My opinion, miss,\u0027 returned Mr. Cruncher, `is as, you\u0027re right. Likewise wot I\u0027ll stand by you, right or wrong. `I am so distracted with fear and hope for our precious creatures,\u0027 said Miss Pross, wildly crying, `that I am incapable of forming any plan. Are you capable of forming any plan, my dear good Mr. Cruncher?\u0027 `Respectin\u0027 a future spear o\u0027 life, miss,\u0027 returned Mr. Cruncher, `I hope so. Respectin\u0027 any present use o\u0027 this here blessed old head o\u0027 mine, I think not. Would you do me the favour, miss, to take notice o\u0027 two promises and wows wot it is my wishes fur to record in this here crisis?\u0027 `Oh, for gracious sake!\u0027 cried Miss Pross, still wildly crying, `record them at once, and get them out of the way, like an excellent man. `First,\u0027 said Mr. Cruncher, who was all in a tremble, and who spoke with an ashy and solemn visage, `them poor things well out o\u0027 this, never no more will I do it, never no more!\u0027 `I am quite sure, Mr. Cruncher,\u0027 returned Miss Pross, `that you never will do it again, whatever it is, and I beg you not to think it necessary to mention more particularly what it is.\u0027 `No, miss,\u0027 returned Jerry, `it shall not be named to you. Second: them poor things well out o\u0027 this, and never no more will I interfere with Mrs. Cruncher\u0027s flopping, never no more!\u0027 `Whatever housekeeping arrangement that may be,\u0027 said Miss Pross, striving to dry her eyes and compose herself, `I have no doubt it is best that Mrs. Cruncher should have it entirely under her own superintendence.--O my poor darlings!\u0027 `I go so far as to say, miss, morehover,\u0027 proceeded Mr. Cruncher, with a most alarming tendency to hold forth as from a pulpit--`and let my words be took down and took to Mrs. Cruncher through yourself--that wot my opinions respectin\u0027 flopping has undergone a change, and that wot I only hope with all my heart as Mrs. Cruncher may be a flopping at the present time.\u0027 There, there, there! I hope she is, my dear man,\u0027 cried the distracted Miss Pross, `and I hope she finds it answering her expectations.\u0027 `Forbid it,\u0027 proceeded Mr. Cruncher, with additional solemnity, additional slowness, and additional tendency to hold forth and hold out, `as anything wot I have ever said or done should be wisited on my earnest wishes for them poor creeturs now! Forbid it as we shouldn\u0027t all flop (if it was anyways conwenient) to get `em out o\u0027 this here dismal risk! Forbid it, miss! Wot I say, for--BID it!\u0027 This was Mr. Cruncher\u0027s conclusion after a protracted but vain endeavour to find a better one. And still Madame Defarge, pursuing her way along the streets, came nearer and nearer. `If we ever get back to our native land,\u0027 said Miss Pross, `you may rely upon my telling Mrs. Cruncher as much as I may be able to remember and understand of what you have so impressively said; and at all events you may be sure that I shall bear witness to your being thoroughly in earnest at this dreadful time. Now, pray let us think! My esteemed Mr. Cruncher, let us think!\u0027 Still, Madame Defarge, pursuing her way along the streets, came nearer and nearer. `If you were to go before,\u0027 said Miss Pross, `and stop the vehicle and horses from coming here, and were to wait somewhere for me; wouldn\u0027t that be best?\u0027 Mr. Cruncher thought it might be best. `Where could you wait for me?\u0027 asked Miss Pross. Mr. Cruncher was so bewildered that he could think of no locality but Temple Bar. Alas! Temple Bar was hundreds of miles away, and Madame Defarge was drawing very near indeed. `By the cathedral door,\u0027 said Miss Pross. `Would it be much out of the way, to take me in, near the great cathedral door between the two towers?\u0027 `No, miss,\u0027 answered Mr. Cruncher. `Then, like the best of men,\u0027 said Miss Pross, `go to the posting-house straight, and make that change.\u0027 `I am doubtful,\u0027 said Mr. Cruncher, hesitating and shaking his head, `about leaving of you, you see. We don\u0027t know what may happen.\u0027 `Heaven knows we don\u0027t,\u0027 returned Miss Pross, `but have no fear for me. Take me in at the cathedral, at Three o\u0027clock, or as near it as you can, and I am sure it will be better than our going from here. I feel certain of it. There! Bless you, Mr. Cruncher! Think--not of me, but of the lives that may depend on both of us !\u0027 This exordium, and Miss Pross\u0027s two hands in quite agonised entreaty clasping his, decided Mr. Cruncher. With an encouraging nod or two, he immediately went out to alter the arrangements, and left her by herself to follow as she had proposed. The having originated a precaution which was already in course of execution, was a great relief to Miss Pross. The necessity of Composing her appearance so that it should attract no special notice in the streets, was another relief She looked at her watch, and it was twenty minutes past two. She had no time to lose, but must get ready at once. Afraid, in her extreme perturbation, of the loneliness of the deserted rooms, and of half-imagined faces peeping from behind every open door in them, Miss Pross got a basin of cold water and began laving her eyes, which were swollen and red. Haunted by her feverish apprehensions, she could not bear to have her sight obscured for a minute at a time by the dripping water, but constantly paused and looked round to see that there was no one watching her. In one of those pauses she recoiled and cried out, for she saw a figure standing in the room. The basin fell to the ground broken, and the water flowed to the feet of Madame Defarge. By strange stern ways, and through much staining blood, those feet had come to meet that water. Madame Defarge looked coldly at her, and said, `The wife of Evrémonde; where is she?\u0027 It flashed upon Miss Pross\u0027s mind that the doors were all standing open, and would suggest the flight. Her first act was to shut them. There were four in the room, and she shut them all. She then placed herself before the door of the chamber which Lucie had occupied. Madame Defarge\u0027s dark eyes followed her through this rapid movement, and rested on her when it was finished. Miss Pross had nothing beautiful about her; years had not tamed the wildness, or softened the grimness, of her appearance; but, she too was a determined woman in her different way, and she measured Madame Defarge with her eyes, every inch. `You might, from your appearance, be the wife of Lucifer,\u0027 said Miss Pross, in her breathing. `Nevertheless, you shall not get the better of me. I am an Englishwoman. Madame Defarge looked at her scornfully, but still with something of Miss Pross\u0027s own perception that they two were at bay. She saw a tight, hard, wiry woman before her, as Mr. Lorry had seen in the same figure a woman with a strong hand, in the years gone by. She knew full well that Miss Pross was the family\u0027s devoted friend; Miss Pross knew full well that Madame Defarge was the family\u0027s malevolent enemy. `On my way yonder,\u0027 said Madame Defarge, with a slight movement of her hand towards the fatal spot, `where they reserve my chair and my knitting for me, I am come, to make my compliments to her in passing. I wish to see her. `I know that your intentions are evil,\u0027 said Miss Pross, `and you may depend upon it, I\u0027ll hold my own against them.\u0027 Each spoke in her own language; neither understood the other\u0027s words; both were very watchful, and intent to deduce from look and manner, what the unintelligible words meant. `It will do her no good to keep herself concealed from me at this moment,\u0027 said Madame Defarge. `Good patriots will know what that means. Let me see her. Go tell her that I wish to see her. Do you hear?\u0027 `If those eyes of yours were bed-winches,\u0027 returned Miss Pross, `and I was an English four-poster, they shouldn\u0027t loose a splinter of me. No, you wicked foreign woman; I am your match.\u0027 Madame Defarge was not likely to follow these idiomatic remarks in detail; but, she so far understood them as to perceive that she was set at naught. `Woman imbecile and pig-like!\u0027 said Madame Defarge, frowning. `I take no answer from you. I demand to see her. Either tell her that I demand to see her, or stand out of the way of the door and let me go to her!\u0027 This, with an angry explanatory wave of her right arm. `I little thought,\u0027 said bliss Pross, `that I should ever want to understand your nonsensical language; but I would give all I have, except the clothes I wear, to know whether you suspect the truth, or any part of it.\u0027 Neither of them for a single moment released the other\u0027s eyes. Madame Defarge had not moved from the spot where she stood when Miss Pross first became aware of her; but she now advanced one step. `I am a Briton,\u0027 said Miss Pross, `I am desperate. I don\u0027t care an English Two-pence for myself. I know that the longer I keep you here, the greater hope there is for my Ladybird. I\u0027ll not leave a handful of that dark hair upon your head, if you lay a finger on me!\u0027 Thus Miss Pross, with a shake of her head and a flash of her eyes between every rapid sentence, and every rapid sentence a whole breath. Thus Miss Pross, who had never struck a blow in her life. But, her courage was of that emotional nature that it brought the irrepressible tears into her eyes. This was a courage that Madame Defarge so little comprehended as to mistake for weakness. `Ha, ha!\u0027 she laughed, `you poor wretch! What are you worth! I address myself to that Doctor.\u0027 Then she raised her voice and called out, `Citizen Doctor! Wife of Evrémonde! Child of Evrémonde! Any person but this miserable fool, answer the Citizeness Defarge!\u0027 Perhaps the following silence, perhaps some latent disclosure in the expression of Miss Pross\u0027s face, perhaps a sudden misgiving apart from either suggestion, whispered to Madame Defarge that they were gone. Three of the doors she opened swiftly, and looked in. `Those rooms are all in disorder, there has been hurried packing, there are odds and ends upon the ground. There is no one in that room behind you! Let me look.\u0027 `Never!\u0027 said Miss Pross, who understood the request as perfectly as Madame Defarge understood the answer. `If they are not in that room, they are gone, and can be pursued and brought back,\u0027 said Madame Defarge to herself. `As long as you don\u0027t know whether they are in that room or not, you are uncertain what to do,\u0027 said Miss Pross to herself; `and you shall not know that, if I can prevent your knowing it; and know that, or not know that, you shall not leave here while I can hold you.\u0027 `I have been in the streets from the first, nothing has stopped me, I will tear you to pieces, but I will have you from that door,\u0027 said Madame Defarge. `We are alone at the top of a high house in a solitary courtyard, we are not likely to be heard, and I pray for bodily strength to keep you here, while every minute you are here is worth a hundred thousand guineas to my darling,\u0027 said Miss Pross. Madame Defarge made at the door. Miss Pross, on the instinct of the moment, seized her round tile waist in both her arms, and held her tight. It was in vain for Madame Defarge to struggle and to strike; Miss Pross, with the vigorous tenacity of love, always so much stronger than hate, clasped her tight, and even lifted her from the floor in the struggle that they had. The two hands of Madame Defarge buffeted and tore her face; but, Miss Pross, with her head down, held her round the waist, and clung to her with more than the hold of a drowning woman. Soon, Madame Defarge\u0027s hands ceased to strike, and felt at her encircled waist. `It is under my arm,\u0027 said Miss Pross, in smothered tones, `you shall not draw it. I am stronger than you, I bless Heaven for it. I\u0027ll hold you till one or other of us faints or dies!\u0027 Madame Defarge\u0027s hands were at her bosom. Miss Pross looked up, saw what it was, struck at it, struck out a flash and a crash, and stood alone--blinded with smoke. All this was in a second. As the smoke cleared, leaving an awful stillness, it passed out on the air, like the soul of the furious woman whose body lay lifeless on the ground. In the first fright and horror of her situation, Miss Pross passed the body as far from it as she could, and ran down the stairs to call for fruitless help. Happily, she bethought herself of the consequences of what she did, in time to check herself and go back. It was dreadful to go in at the door again; but, she did go in, and even went near it, to get the bonnet and other things that she must wear. These she put on, out on the staircase, first shutting and locking the door and taking away the key. She then sat down on the stairs a few moments to breathe and to cry, and then got up and hurried away. In crossing the bridge, she dropped the door key in the river. Arriving at the cathedral some few minutes before her escort, and waiting there, she thought, what if the key were already taken in a net, what if it were identified, what if the door were opened and the remains discovered, what if she were stopped at the gate, sent to prison, and charged with murder! In the midst of these fluttering thoughts, the escort appeared, took her in, and took her away. `Is there any noise in the streets?\u0027 she asked him. `The usual noises,\u0027 Mr. Cruncher replied; and looked surprised by the question and by her aspect. `I don\u0027t hear you,\u0027 said Miss Pross. `What do you say?\u0027 It was in vain for Mr. Cruncher to repeat what he said; Miss Pross could not hear him. `So I\u0027ll nod my head,\u0027 thought Mr. Cruncher, amazed, `at all events she\u0027ll see that.\u0027 And she did. `Is there any noise in the streets now?\u0027 asked Miss Pross again, presently. Again Mr. Cruncher nodded his head. `I don\u0027t hear it.\u0027 `Gone deaf in a hour?\u0027 said Mr. Cruncher, ruminating, with his mind much disturbed; `wot\u0027s come to her?\u0027 `I feel,\u0027 said Miss Pross, `as if there had been a flash and a crash, and that crash was the last thing I should ever hear in this life.\u0027 `Blest if she ain\u0027t in a queer condition!\u0027 said Mr. Cruncher, more and more disturbed. `Wot can she have been a takin\u0027, to keep her courage up? Hark! There\u0027s the roll of them dreadful carts! You can hear that, miss?\u0027 `I can hear,\u0027 said Miss Pross, seeing that he spoke to her, `nothing. O, my good man, there was first a great crash, and then a great stillness, and that stillness seems to be fixed and unchangeable, never to be broken any more as long as my life lasts.\u0027 `If she don\u0027t hear the roll of those dreadful carts, now very nigh their journey\u0027s end,\u0027 said Mr. Cruncher, glancing over his shoulder, `it\u0027s my opinion that indeed she never will hear anything else in this world.\u0027 And indeed she never did. “可是我们的德伐日，”雅克三号说，“无疑是个优秀的共和分子，是么？” “在法国没有比他更优秀的了，”口若悬河的复仇女神尖声尖气地肯定。 “别吵，小复仇，”德伐日太太略微皱了皱眉，伸出个指头挡在她助手的唇边，“听我说，公民伙计，我的丈夫是个优秀的共和分子，也是个大胆的人，值得共和国的尊重。他也获得了共和国的信任。但是他有他的弱点，他对医生心慈手软。” “很遗憾，”雅克三号低沉地说，含义不明地摇着脑袋，几根残忍的手指又在嘴边猴急地抓挠。“那就不太像个好公民了，很遗憾。” “你们要明白，”老板娘说，“我对医生没兴趣。他丢不丢脑袋我不管，那对我都一样。但是埃佛瑞蒙德一家可得要斩草除根，老婆和孩子必须跟丈夫和爸爸去。”、 “她有一个漂亮的脑袋跟着去呢，”雅克三号低沉地说。“我在这几看见过不少蓝眼睛金头发的脑袋，参孙提起那脑袋的样子可真迷人。”他虽是个吃人恶魔，说话倒像个美食家。 德伐日太太垂下眼脸想了想。 “还有那孩于也是金头发蓝眼睛，”雅克三号带着享受的神气思考着。“在那儿很少看见孩子。倒挺迷人的：” “总而言之，”德伐日太太停顿了片刻，说道，“这事我信不过我丈夫。我从昨天晚上起就感到不但不能把我计划的细节告诉他，而旦动手要快，否则他还可能走漏消息，让他们跑掉。” “绝不能让他们跑掉，”雅克三号低沉地说。“一个也不准。就现在这种情况人数还不到一半呢。应该每天杀他一百二十个的。” “总而言之，”德伐日太太说下去，“我要把这一家斩草除根的道理我的老公不理解；他对医生那么关怀的道理我也想不通。因此我得亲手采取行动。来呀，小公民。” 锯木工用手碰了碰红便帽，走了过来。他对她毕恭毕敬，服服帖帖，怕得要命。 “你今天就可以作证，证明那些手势么，小公民？德伐日太太严厉地说。 “可以，可以，为什么不可以！”锯木工叫道，“每天，不论天晴下雨，从两点到四点，总在那儿打手势，有时带着那小的，有时没带。我知道的事我是知道的。我是亲眼看见的。” 他说话时做了许多手势，仿佛偶然模仿着几个他其实从没见过的复杂手势。 “显然是搞阴谋，”雅克三号说，“再清楚不过了。” “陪审团不会有问题吧？”德伐日太太露出个阴沉的微笑把眼光转向他说。 “相信爱国的陪审团吧，亲爱的女公民，我可以为我陪审团的伙计们打包票。” “现在我来想想，”德伐日太太又沉思起来，“再想一想吧！为了我那老公，我能不能放过医生呢？放不放过对我都一样。我能放过他么？” “他也要算一个脑袋呢，”雅克三号低声说。“我们现有的脑袋还嫌不够，放过了怪可惜的，我觉得。” “我见到那女人的时候，医生也跟她一样在打手势呢！”德伐日太太争辩道，“我不能谈这个不谈那个，我不能把这案子全交给这个小公民去办，因为我做起证人来也并不差。” 复仇女神和雅克三号彼此争先恐后地肯定她是最值得尊重，也是最精采的证人。小公民不甘落后，便说她是举世无双的证人。 “不，我不能放过他，”德伐日太太说，“他得凭命去闯了！你三点钟有事，要去看今天杀的这一批——是吗？” 这话问的是锯木工。锯木工赶快说他也要去，而且抓紧机会补充说，他是最积极的共和分子。实际上若是有什么东西使他失去了享受一边抽午后烟、一边欣赏国家级剃头师傅精采表演的机会，他就会成为最孤独的共和分子了。他的表白有点过分，甚至叫人怀疑他每时每刻都在为自己那渺小的安全担心。而他也许确实在受着怀疑，因为德伐日太太一双黑眼睛正轻蔑地望着他。 “我也同样要到那儿去。”老板娘说。“那儿的事结束之后，你们就到我那儿，到圣安托万去，就定在八点吧，我们要到我那个区去揭发这几个人。” 锯木工说他若是能陪伴女公民，他会引以为荣，感到骄傲的。女公民却白了他一眼，弄得他很尴尬，像小狗一样躲着她的目光，钻到木柴堆里拉起锯来，借以掩饰自己的狼狈。 德伐日太太招呼陪审员和复仇女神往门边靠了靠，向他俩进一步说明了她的观点： “那女的现在准在家等着他死去的时刻。她会哀悼，会痛苦，一定会对共和国的审判心怀不满，对共和国的敌人满怀同情。我要到她那儿去。” “多么令人钦佩的女人，多么值得崇拜的女人！”雅克三号欣喜若狂，叫道。“啊，我的心肝宝贝！”复仇女神叫了起来，拥抱了她。 “你把我的编织活儿拿去，”德伐日太太把毛线放到助手手里，“把它放在我平时的座位上，占好座包。马上去，因为十有八九今天的人会比平常多。” “我衷心接受上级的命令，”复仇女神敏捷作答，而且亲了亲她的面颊。“你不会迟到吧？” “行刑开始之前我准到。” “囚车到达之前。一准要到，我的宝贝，”复仇女神对着她的背影说，因为她已转身上了街。“囚车到达之前！” 德伐日太太轻轻挥了挥手，表示她听见了，一定准时到达，然后便穿过泥泞、绕过了监狱大墙。复仇女神和陪审员望着她远去，对她那漂亮的身影和无与伦比的道德秉赋表示了崇高的赞赏。 那时的许多妇女都被时代之手捏弄得可怕地变了形，却没有一个妇女能比现在走在大街上的这个无情的女人更可怕的了。她有坚强勇敢的性格，精明敏捷的头脑，还有巨大的决心。她具有一种美，那美不但赋予了她稳定坚实、苦大仇深的特色，而且使人不由得由衷地赞美这一特色。无论情况如何，那“混乱的时代”是必然会使她出人头地的。但是由于她从儿童时代起就深感含冤受屈，养成了根深蒂固的阶级仇恨，机会便把她发展成了一只母老虎。她是绝对没有怜惜之情的。即使曾有过也早已泯灭了。 一个清白无辜的男人要为父辈的罪行而死亡，这在她完全不算一回事。她看见的不是他，而是他的父辈。那个男人的妻子要变成寡妇，女儿要变成孤儿，这在她也不算一回事。那种惩罚还不够，因为她们都是她天生的敌人，是她的战利品，本没有活下去的权利。要使她谅解是办不到的，她没有怜惜之心，甚至对自己也如此。若是她在自己参加过的战斗中倒下了，她也不会怜惜自己；若是她被送上断头台，她也只会咬牙切齿恨不得让送她上断头台的人跟她易地而处，却没有丝毫怨艾伤感的柔情。 在德伐日太太那粗布袍子下而的就是这样一颗心。那布袍她随意穿着，却很合身，但带几分怪诞。那一头黑发在粗糙的红便帽之下显得尤其丰密。她胸前掖了一把子弹上膛的手枪。腰间别了一把磨得飞快的匕首。她便以这样一身装束、这样一个角色的自信步伐在大街上走着：表现了习惯于光着腿赤着脚在褐色的沙滩上行走的妇女的矫健和轻松。 此时那辆旅行马车正在等着旅客到齐。昨天晚上罗瑞先生为普洛丝小姐是否坐这辆车曾经煞费踌躇。马车需要避免超重，尤其需要尽量缩短检查马车和乘客的时间，因为他们是否能逃掉大有可能决定于在这儿那儿省下的分分秒秒。经过苦苦思索，他终于决定让普洛丝小姐和杰瑞去坐那时很有名的最轻便型马车，在三点钟出发，因为他们可以自由出入巴黎。他们没有行车拖累，可以很快便赶上驿车，赶到前面去，事先给驿车雇好马匹，使它在夜间宝贵的时间里迅速前进—一夜里是最怕耽误的。 普洛丝小姐明白了照这种安排她在那千钧一发的时刻可以起到的真正作用，便高高兴兴地同意了。她跟杰瑞看到马车出发，看清楚了所罗门送来的是什么人，又提心吊胆地忙了十来分钟，现在正做着追赶驿车的最后准备。这时德伐日太太正在街上行走，距离这间寓所越来越近了一—这里的房客已全都撤离，只有他俩还在商量： “现在，克朗彻先生，”普洛丝小姐说，她激动得话也说不出，站也站不住，动也不会动，连活都不知道该怎么活下去了。“你觉得我们若是不从这个院子出发，怎么样？今天已经从这儿走了一辆车，再走一辆车会引起疑心的。” “我认为你说得对，小姐，”克朗彻先生回答。“而且我总是拥护你的，不管你对不对。” “我为几个心肝宝贝又是害怕、又抱着希望，简直都急疯了，”普洛丝小姐放声大哭，“我是什么主意都想不出来了。你能出个主意么，我亲爱的可怜的克朗彻先生？” “要说对将来的生活出点主意，我大概还能行，小姐，”克朗彻回答，“要说在此刻开动我这上帝保佑的老脑筋，我怕是办不到了。在眼前的紧急关头我想作出两个保证，发两道誓言，你能帮助我记住么，小姐？” “啊，天呐！”普洛丝小姐还在号啕痛哭说，“我马上记住，可你得像个出色的男子汉一样别把它挂在心上。” “首先，”克朗彻先生全身发抖，说话时面如死灰，神情庄重，“只要那几个可怜的人能安全脱险，我以后就不再干那种事了，再也不干了！” “我很肯定，克朗彻先生，”普洛丝小姐回答，“你以后决不会再干了，不管是什么。我求你不要认为需要特别说明那是什么。” “不会的，小姐，”杰瑞回答，“我是不会告诉你的。第二，只要那几个可怜的人能平安脱险，我就再也不会干涉克朗彻太太跪地做祈祷了。再也不会了！” “‘不管是什么家务事，”普洛丝小姐擦着眼泪努力镇定着自己说，“我都相信，还是完全交给克朗彻太太经管为好。啊，我可怜的宝贝们！” “我甚至还要说，小姐，”克朗彻先生接着讲下去，样子很令人吃惊，好像是在布道台上发表演说，“请你记下我的话，亲自告诉我太太，我对做祷告的事已经改变了看法。我倒打心眼里希望克朗彻太太这时在为我们跪下来做祷告呢！” “千万别应验，”克朗彻先生说下去，说得更庄严、更缓慢、更有坚持到底的意思。“可不能让我说过的话、干过的事现在报应在我为这些可怜的人许的愿上！别应验，我们都应当跪下来（若是方便的话）祈祷他们逃出这种可怕的危险。别应验，小姐：我要说的是，别应—一验！”这是克朗彻先生在长期努力想得到一个更好的结论之后所下的结论。 这时，德伐日太太正沿着大街走来，越来越近了。 “你说得太动人了，”普洛丝小姐说，“若是我们能回到故乡，请相信我，我一定把我记得住而又听懂了的话转告克朗彻太太。而且，无论发生了什么事，你都可以相信我，对你在这个可怕时刻的一本正经的态度可以作证。现在，请让我们来想一想，我尊重的克朗彻先生，让我们来想一想！” 这时，德伐日太太正沿着大街走来，越来越近了。 “若是你能先走一步，”普洛丝小姐说，“叫马车别到这儿来，另找个地方等我，是不是会更好？” 克朗彻认为那样会更好。 “那你在什么地方等我呢？”普洛丝小姐问。 克朗彻满脑子糊涂，除了伦敦法学会，他想不出别的地点。可是天哪！伦敦法学会远在千里之外，而德伐日太太只不过咫尺之遥 “在大教堂门口吧，”普洛丝小姐说。“我在那地方上车不太绕道吧？在大教堂两座钟楼中间那大门口？” “不绕道，小姐，”克朗彻回答。 “那么，就像个最好的男子汉一样，马上去车站，把路线改了，”普洛丝小姐说。 “我离开你可有点不放心，”克朗彻先生犹豫起来，摇着头说。“你看，不知道会发生什么情况的。” “那只有天才知道，”普洛丝小姐回答。“别为我担心。三点钟或略早一点到大教堂来接我，我相信那要比从这儿出发好得多，我肯定。好了！上帝保佑你，克朗彻先生！别顾着我，顾着那几条命吧，那得靠我们呢！” 这一番言辞，再加上普洛丝小姐两只手攥住他的手，表现了痛苦的请求，使克朗彻先生下定了决心。他点了点头，表示鼓励，便去改变行车路线了，留下她一个人按自己的建议去跟他会合。 想出了这么一个预防措施，而且已经开始执行，普洛丝小姐大大她松了一口气。她的外表必须镇静如常，以免引起特别注意，这也使她安定下来。她看看表，两点二十分。她再也不能浪费时间了，必须立即作好准备。 她心里乱成一团。没了人的屋子空荡荡的，她害怕；每一道开着的门背后都仿佛有面孔在窥视，她也怕。普洛丝小姐打了一盆水开始洗她那双红肿的眼睛。她满怀莫名的恐俱，很怕眼睛上的水会暂时挡住了视线，因此不断停下来四面瞧瞧，怕有人在看她。有一次她刚停下来却不禁大叫起来，往后一退，因为她见到一个人影站在屋里。 脸盆落到地下摔碎了，水流到德伐日太太脚边——那双脚曾从血泊中走过，步伐威严而独特。” 德伐日太太冷冷地望着她说，“埃佛瑞蒙德的太太到哪儿去了？” 普洛丝小姐突然想起所有的门分开着，会叫人想到逃跑。她的第一个动作便是把门全都关了起来。屋里有四道门，她全关上了。然后她站在露西的房门口。 德伐日太太深色的眼睛跟随着她那迅速的行动，然后落在她身上。岁月并不曾驯服普洛丝小姐的野性，也不曾让她那粗糙的外形变得柔和。她也是个强悍的女人，虽然路数不同。她也用眼睛打量了德伐日太太身上的每一部分。 “别看你那样子像魔鬼的老婆，”普洛丝小姐细声说，“你占不了我的上风，我可是个英国女人。” 德伐日太太轻蔑地望着她，她的感觉跟普洛丝小姐却也差不多；她俩可算是狭路相逢了。德伐日太太眼前是个结实、健壮、矫捷的妇女，正跟多年前罗瑞先生眼前那个胳膊结实的妇女一样。德伐日太太很清楚，普洛丝小姐是这家的忠实朋友；普洛丝小姐也很清楚，德伐日太太是这家的凶恶敌人。 “我要到那边去，”德伐日太太一只手往那杀人的地方略微挥了一挥，“她们在那几给我保留了座位和我的毛线活儿。我是顺道来向她致敬的。我想见见她。” “我知道你不怀好意，”普洛丝小姐说。“不过你放心，你那坏心眼休想在我面前得逞。” 两人一个说法语，一个说英语，谁也听不懂谁的话，可彼此都很警惕，想从对方的神色态度推测出没听懂的意思。 “这个时候把她藏起来不让她见我，对她可没有好处，”德伐日太太说。“优秀的爱国者都明白那是什么意思。让我见她。告诉她我要见她。听见了没有？” “就算你那眼睛骨碌碌转得像辘轳，”普洛丝小姐回答，“我可是张四根柱子的英国床，任你眼睛怎么转，也别想动我一分一毫。不行，你这个恶毒的女老外，我今儿跟你泡上了。” 看来德伐日太太对这些村言俚语并不理解，但却明白对方并没有把自己放在眼里。 “白痴，蠢猪！”德伐日太太皱着眉头。“我不要你回答，我要求跟她见面。你去告诉她，我要见地，再不然就别站在门口，让我自己进去！”说时她怒气冲冲打着手势。 “我才懒得听你那瞎胡闹的外国话呢，”普洛丝小姐说，“不过为了知道你是否猜到了真象（或许只猜到一部分），我倒愿意把我的一切都送给人——除了这一身衣服之外。” 两人彼此目不转睛地盯着。德伐日太太从普洛丝小姐意识到她来到这儿以后就在原地没动，可现在她前进了一步。 “我可是个不列颠人，”普洛丝小姐说。“今天我豁出去了，我愿拿这条不值两便士的命拼了。我知道我把你缠在这里的时间越长，我那小鸟儿就越有希望。你要是敢碰我一指头，我就把你那黑头发拔个精光，一根不剩！” 这样，普洛丝小姐每匆忙说完一句话就要摇一摇脑袋，瞪一瞪眼睛，而她的每句话又都说得气喘吁吁。她像这样开始了战斗—一她可是一辈于没跟人干过仗的。 可是她的勇气却带着感情冲动的性质，她的眼里已不禁噙满了泪珠。对她这种形式的勇气表现，德伐日太太却误会了，以为是软弱。“哈！哈！”她笑了，“你这个可怜虫！还充什么好汉！我要找医生讲话。”说时便放开嗓门叫了起来，“医生公民！埃佛瑞蒙德太太！埃佛瑞蒙德家的媳妇！除了这个可怜兮的笨蛋，你们谁来跟女公民德伐日答话？” 也许是由于随之而来的沉默，也许是由于普洛丝小姐的表情无意中泄露了天机，也许是由于与两者无关的突然灵机一动，总之德伐日太太看出他们已经走掉了。她赶紧打开了三道门，往里面看。 “三间屋子都乱糟糟的，有人匆忙打过行李，七零八碎的东西扔了满地。你身后的屋里怕也是没有人了！让我看看！” “休想！”普洛丝小姐完全明白她的要求，正如德伐日太太完全明白她的回答一样。 “他们若是不在那屋里，便是逃跑了。还可以派人去追，把他们抓回来，”德伐日太太自言自语。 “只要你弄不清楚她们究竟在不在这屋里，你就无法决定该怎么办，”普洛丝小姐自言自语。“只要我不让你弄清楚，你就别想弄清楚。不管你清楚不清楚，我只要能缠住你，你就别想离开这儿。” “我从小就在街面上跑，什么东西也没拦住过我。我能把你撕得粉碎，我现在得把你从门口轰走，”德伐日太太说。 “我们这院子孤零零的，高楼顶上又只有我们两个，看样子不会有人听见。我祈祷上帝给我力量把你缠住，你在这儿的每一分钟对我那宝贝儿都值十万金币呢！”普洛丝小姐说。 德伐日太太往屋里便闯，普洛丝小姐一时性起，伸出双臂把她紧紧拦腰抱住。德伐日太太又是挣扎，又是殴打，但都无济于事。普洛丝小姐满怀挚爱，有坚韧的活力，把她抱得很紧——爱比恨永远要强大得多——在挣扎中她甚至把她抱离了地面。德伐日太太用两只手打她，抓她的脸，可是普洛丝小姐只顾低了头搂住她的腰，比怕淹死的女人搂得还紧。 德伐日太太马上停止了殴打，伸手往被搂紧的腰间摸去。“你那玩艺儿在我的胳膊下呢，”普洛丝小姐屏住气说，“你休想拔出来。谢谢老天爷，我的力气可比你大。我要一直抱住你，直到我们有一个昏过去或者是死掉！” 德伐日太太的手己到了胸前。普洛丝小姐抬头一看，认出了那是什么东西，便一拳打了过去，打出了一道闪光、一声巨响，然后便是她一个人站在那里，什么都看不见了。 这一切只发生在刹那之间。硝烟散去，只留下可怕的平静。硝烟就像那大发雷霆的妇女的灵魂一样在空气里消散了，那女人的身子却躺在地上，死了。 普洛丝小姐被这情况吓了一跳，怕得要命。她先是往楼下跑，想离那尸体远远的，去找其实找不到的人帮忙。幸好她想起了自己惹下的祸的后果，便赶快停步，跑了回来。她十分害怕重新进屋，可她仍然进去了，而且从尸体身边走过，取出了她必须穿戴的帽子和衣物。她然后下了楼，关了门，上了锁，取下钥匙，又坐在台阶上喘了一会儿气，哭了一会儿，这才站起身来匆匆走掉。 幸好她的帽子上垂着面纱，否则她在路上怕是难免受人盘问的。也幸好她天生长相奇特，因此不至于像别的妇女给人衣冠不整的印象。她需要这两个有利条件，因为她头发散乱，脸上留下深深的指甲印，衣服也给东拉西扯弄了个乱七八糟，只用颤抖的手匆忙整理过一下。 过桥时她把钥匙扔进了河里。她比她的保镖早几分钟到达大教堂，在等他时她想了许多。若是那钥匙叫渔网网住了会怎么样？若是鉴定出是哪家的钥匙会怎么样？若是门打开，发现了尸体会怎么样？若是在城门自把她扣留下来，送进监狱，判她杀人罪又会怎么样？她正在满脑子胡思乱想，她的保镖来了，让她上了车，把她带走了。 “街上有闹声没有？”她问他。 “有日常的闹声，”克朗彻先生回答，他因为这个问题和她那副怪像露出一脸惊讶。 “你的话我没听见，”普洛丝小姐说，“你说的是什么？” 克朗彻先生重复了他的回答，可那也没有用，普洛丝小姐仍然听不见。“那我就点头吧，”克朗彻先生大吃一惊，想道。“这她无论如何是懂得的。”她倒是懂的。 “街上现在有闹声没有？”普洛丝小姐不久又问。 克朗彻先生义点了点头。 “可我没听见。” “才一个小时耳朵怎么就聋了？”克朗彻先生寻思，心里很着急。“她出了什么事了？” “我觉得，”普洛丝小姐说，“好像火光一闪，又砰的一声，那一声就成了我这一辈子听见的最后一声了。” “她这个样子可真奇怪！”克朗彻先生越来越紧张，“她喝了什么玩艺儿给自己壮胆了么？听！那吓人的囚车在隆隆地响！你听见车声了没有，小姐？” “一点儿也没听见，”普洛丝小姐见他说话便回答。“啊，我的好人，先是一声砰，声音大极了，然后就没有声音了，再也没有声音了，永远没有了，我这一辈子怕是再也听不见声音了。” 既然她连那些可怕的四车的轰隆声都听不见，——囚车，快到目的地了，”克朗彻先生掉过头看了一眼说，“我看她确实是再也听不见这世界上的声音了。” 她确实是再也听不见了。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/74/4136.html","bookId":543,"book":{"id":543,"title":"A Tale of Two
