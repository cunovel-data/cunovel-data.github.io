{"id":32880,"no":40,"title":"Book 3 Chapter 11 Dusk","content":"THE wretched wife of the innocent man thus doomed to die, under the sentence, as if she had been mortally stricken. But, she uttered no sound; and so strong was the voice within her, representing that it was she of all the world who must uphold him in his misery and not augment it, that it quickly raised her, even from that shock.\n The judges having to take part in a public demonstration out of doors, the tribunal adjourned. The quick noise and movement of the court\u0027s emptying itself by many passages had not ceased, when Lucie stood stretching out her arms towards her husband, with nothing in her face but love and consolation.\n `If I might touch him! If I might embrace him once! O, good citizens, if you would have so much compassion for us!\u0027\n There was but a gaoler left, along with two of the four men who had taken him last night, and Barsad. The people had all poured out to the show in the streets. Barsad proposed to the rest, `Let her embrace him then; it is but a moment.\u0027 It was silently acquiesced in, and they passed her over the seats in the hall to a raised place, where he, by leaning over the dock, could fold her in his arms.\n `Farewell, dear darling of my soul. My parting blessing on my love. We shall meet again, where the weary are at rest!\u0027\n They were her husband\u0027s words, as he held her to his bosom.\n `I can bear it, dear Charles. I am supported from above: don\u0027t suffer for me. A parting blessing for our child.\u0027\n `I send it to her by you. I kiss her by you. I say farewell to her by you.\u0027\n `My husband. No! A moment!\u0027 He was tearing himself apart from her. `We shall not be separated long. I feel that this will break my heart by-and-by; but I will do my duty while I can, and when I leave her, God will raise up friends for her, as He did for me.\u0027\n Her father had followed her, and would have fallen on his knees to both of them, but that Darnay put out a hand and seized him, crying:\n `No, no! What have you done, what have you done, that you should kneel to us! We know now, what a struggle you made of old. We know now, what you underwent when you suspected my descent, and when you knew it. We know now, the natural antipathy you strove against, and conquered, for her dear sake. We thank you with all our hearts, and all our love and duty. Heaven be with you!\u0027\n Her father\u0027s only answer was to draw his hands through his white hair, and wring them with a shriek of anguish.\n `It could not be otherwise,\u0027 said the prisoner. `All things have worked together as they have fallen out. It was the always-vain endeavour to discharge my poor mother\u0027s trust that first brought my fatal presence near you. Good could never come of such evil, a happier end was not in nature to so unhappy a beginning. Be comforted, and forgive me. Heaven bless you!\u0027\n As he was drawn away, his wife released him, and stood looking after him with her hands touching one another in the attitude of prayer, and with a radiant look upon her face, in which there was even a comforting smile. As he went out at the prisoners\u0027 door, she turned, laid her head lovingly on her father\u0027s breast, tried to speak to him, and fell at his feet.\n Then, issuing from the obscure corner from which he had never moved, Sydney Carton came and took her up. Only her father and Mr. Lorry were with her. His arm trembled as it raised her, and supported her head. Yet, there was an air about him that was not all of pity--that had a flush of pride in it.\n `Shall I take her to a coach? I shall never feel her weight.\u0027\n He carried her lightly to the door, and laid her tenderly down in a coach. Her father and their old friend got into it, and he took his seat beside the driver.\n `Don\u0027t recall her to herself,\u0027 he said, softly, to the latter, `she is better so. Don\u0027t revive her to consciousness, while she only faints.\u0027\n `Oh, Carton, Carton, dear Carton!\u0027 cried little Lucie, springing up and throwing her arms passionately round him, in a burst of grief. `Now that you have come, I think you will do something to help mamma, something to save papa! O, look at her, dear Carton! Can you, of all the people who love her, bear to see her so?\u0027\n He bent over the child, and laid her blooming cheek against his face. He put her gently from him, and looked at her unconscious mother.\n `Before I go,\u0027 he said, and paused--\u0027I may kiss her?\u0027\n It was remembered afterwards that when he bent down and touched her face with his lips, he murmured some words. The child, who was nearest to him, told them afterwards, and told her grandchildren when she was a handsome old lady, that she heard him say, `A life you love.\u0027\n When he had gone out into the next room, he turned suddenly on Mr. Lorry and her father, who were following, and said to the latter:\n `You had great influence but yesterday, Doctor Manette; let it at least be tried. These judges, and all the men in power, ire very friendly to you, and very recognisant of your services; are they not?\u0027\n `Nothing connected with Charles was concealed from me. I had the strongest assurances that I should save him; and I did.\u0027 He returned the answer in great trouble, and very slowly.\n `Try them again. The hours between this and to-morrow afternoon are few and short, but try.\u0027\n `I intend to try. I will not rest a moment.\u0027\n `That\u0027s well. I have known such energy as yours do great things before now--though never,\u0027 he added, with a smile and a sigh together, `such great things as this. But try! Of little worth as life is when we misuse it, it is worth that effort. It would cost nothing to lay down if it were not.\u0027\n `I will go,\u0027 said Doctor Manette, `to the Prosecutor and the President straight, and I will go to others whom it is better not to name. I will write too, and--But stay! There is a celebration in the streets, and no one will be accessible until dark.\u0027\n `That\u0027s true. Well! It is a forlorn hope at the best, and not much the forlorner for being delayed till dark. I should like to know how you speed; though, mind! I expect nothing! When are you likely to have seen these dread powers, Doctor Manette?\u0027\n `Immediately after dark, I should hope. Within an hour or two from this.\u0027\n `It will be dark soon after four. Let us stretch the hour or two. If I go to Mr. Lorry\u0027s at nine, shall I hear what you have done, either from our friend or from yourself?\u0027\n `Yes.\u0027 `May you prosper!\u0027\n Mr. Lorry followed Sydney to the outer door, and, touching him on the shoulder as he was going away, caused him to turn.\n `I have no hope,\u0027 said Mr. Lorry, in a low and sorrowful whisper.\n `Nor have I.\u0027\n `If any one of these men, or all of these men, were disposed to spare him--which is a large supposition; for what is his life, or any man\u0027s to them!--I doubt if they durst spare him after the demonstration in the court.\u0027\n `And so do I. I heard the fall of the axe in that sound.\u0027\n Mr. Lorry leaned his arm upon the door-post, and bowed his face upon it.\n `Don\u0027t despond,\u0027 said Carton, very gently; `don\u0027t grieve. I encouraged Doctor Manette in this idea, because I felt that it might one day be consolatory to her. Otherwise, she might think \"his life was wantonly thrown away or wasted,\" and that might trouble her.\u0027\n `Yes, yes, yes,\u0027 returned Mr. Lorry, drying his eyes, `you are right. But he will perish; there is no real hope.\n `Yes. He will perish: there is no real hope,\u0027 echoed Carton. And walked with a settled step, down-stairs. \n 法官们要到外面去参加公众游行，下面的审判延期了。法庭里的人从几道门迅速往外走。喧闹和行动还没有结束，露西便起立向丈夫伸出了双臂，脸上只有挚爱和安慰，没有别的。\n “但愿我能碰一碰他！但愿我能拥抱他一次！啊，善良的公民们，希望你们能这样深刻地同情我们！”\n 人们全上街看热闹去了，只剩下一个典狱官和昨晚来提犯人的四人中的两个，还有一个是巴萨。巴萨对剩下的人说，，就让她拥抱他吧，也不过一会儿工夫。”没人说话，默认了。他们让她穿过法庭座位来到一个高起的地方，囚犯在那儿可以从被告席弯过身子，来拥抱他的妻子。\n “再见了，我灵魂中亲爱的宝贝。我给我的爱人临别的祝福，在厌倦的人们长眠的地方我们还会再见的。”\n 她的丈夫把她搂在胸前这样说。\n “我能受得住，亲爱的查尔斯。我有上天的支持，不要因为我而痛苦。给我们的孩子一个临别的祝福吧！”，\n “我通过你祝福她。我通过你亲吻她。我通过你向她告别。”\n “我的丈夫。不！再呆一会儿！”他已在恋恋不舍地离开她。“我俩分手不会久的。我感到这事不久就会使我心碎而死，但只要我还能行，我便要履行我的职责，等到我离开女儿的时候上帝已经培养出了她的朋友，为了我上帝就曾这样做过。”\n 她的父亲已跟了上来。他几乎要在两人面前脆下，但是达尔内伸出一只手拉住了他，叫道：\n “不，不！你做过什么？你做过什么？为什么要向我们跪下？我们现在才明白了你那时的斗争有多么痛苦。我们现在才明白了在你怀疑、而且知道了我的家世时受了多大的折磨。现在我才明白了你为她的缘战跟发自天性的憎恶作了多少年斗争，并且克服了它。，我们用整个的心、全部的爱和孝顺感谢你。愿上天保佑你！”\n 她父亲的唯一回答是双手插进满头白发，绞着头发发出惨叫。\n “不可能有别的结果的，”囚徒说。“目前的结局是各种因素造成的，是命定的。最初把我带到你身边的是我完成亡母遗愿的永远无法成功的努力。那样的罪恶绝对产生不了善果，就其本质而言，那样不幸的开头是不可能产生什么幸运的结尾的。不要难过，原谅我吧！上天保佑你！”\n 他被带走了。他的妻子放了手，站在那儿望着他，双手合十，像在祈祷，脸上却泛出了光彩，甚至绽出一种安慰的微笑。在他从囚徒进出的门出去之后，她转过身来，把头靠在父亲胸前，打算跟他说话，却晕倒在他的脚下。\n 这时西德尼．卡尔顿走上前来扶起了她。他是从一个僻静的角落出来的，一直就在那儿没有离开过。当时只有她的父亲和罗瑞先生跟她在一起。他的手臂搀起她时颤抖着，并扶住了她的头。但他脸上却有一种并非完全是怜悯的神气，其中泛着骄傲的红晕。\n “我抱她上马车去好不好？我不会觉得她沉的。”\n 他轻轻地抱起她，来到门外，温柔地放进了一辆马车。她的父亲和他们的老朋友也上了车，卡尔顿坐在马车夫旁边。\n 他们来到了大门口——几个小时前他还曾在这儿的黑暗中留连，想象过哪些粗糙的石头是她亲爱的脚踩过的——他又抱起她上了楼，进入了他们的房间，放到了床上。她的孩子和普洛丝小姐在她身边哭了起来。\n “别叫醒她，”他轻声对普洛丝小组说，“这样还好些。她不过是晕过去了，别催她恢复知觉吧！”。\n “啊，卡尔顿，卡尔顿，亲爱的卡尔顿，小露西哭着出来、叫着跳起来用两臂热烈地搂着他的脖子。“现在你来了，我想你会有办法帮助妈妈和救出爸爸的！啊，你看看她吧，亲爱的卡尔顿！在这么多爱她的人中，你能眼睁睁看着她这样么？”\n 他对孩子弯下身去，把她那娇艳的面颊靠着自己的脸，然后轻轻放开了她，望着她昏迷的母亲。\n “在我离开之前，”他说，却又踌躇了——“我可以亲亲她么？”\n 事后他们记得，在他弯下身子用双唇碰着她的脸的时候，曾轻轻说了几个字。当时离他最近的孩子曾告诉他们，她听见他说的是“你所爱的生命”。这话在她自己做祖母之后也还讲给孙子们听。\n 卡尔顿来到隔壁房间，突然转过身面对着跟在后面的罗瑞先生和她的父亲，并对后者说：\n “就是在昨天你也还很有影响，曼内特医生，现在至少还可以试试你的影响。法官和当权的人对你都很友好，也很承认你的贡献，是么？”\n “跟查尔斯有关的事他们从不曾隐瞒过我，我曾得到过很坚决的保证一定能救他，而且也救出了他，”他沉痛而缓慢地回答。\n “再试试吧。从现在到明天下午时间已经不多，但不妨一试。”\n “我打算试一试，我是片刻也不会停止的。”\n “那就好。我见过具有停你这样活动能力的人做出过了不起的大事——尽管，”他笑了笑，叹了口气说，“尽管还没有做出过这么了不起的大事。不过，试试吧！生命使用不当就没有价值，使用到这个问题上倒是很有价值的。即使不行，也不会有什么损失。”\n “我马上去找检察长和庭长，”曼内特医生说，“还要去找别的人。他们的姓名还是不说的好。我还要写信——且慢！街上在搞庆祝会，天黑之前怕是谁也找不到的。”\n “倒也是真的。行了！原本不过是个渺茫的希望，拖到天黑也未见得会更渺茫。我很想知道你的进展情况，不过，记住！我不抱奢望！你什么时候可以跟这些可怕的权势人物见面呢，曼内持医生？”\n “我希望天一黑就见到。从现在算起一两个钟头之后。”\n “四点一过天就黑了。我们不妨再延长一两个小时。若是我九点到罗瑞先生那儿，能从他或者你自己那里听到进展情况么？”\n “能。”\n “祝你顺利！”\n 罗瑞先生跟着西德尼来到外面大门口，在他离开时拍了拍他的肩头，让他转过身来。\n “我不抱希望，”罗瑞先生放低了嗓子悲伤地说。\n “我也不抱希望。”\n “即使这些人里有个把人想宽恕他，甚至是全体都想宽恕他——这是想入非非的，因为他的生命或是任何其他人的生命跟他们有什么相干！——在法庭的那种场面之后，我也怀疑他们有没有胆量那样做。”\n “我也怀疑。我在那一片喧嚣之中听到了斧头落下的声音。”\n 罗瑞先生一只手撑住门框，低头把脸靠在手上。\n “别灰心，”卡尔顿极轻柔地说，“别悲伤。我也用这个意思鼓励过曼内特医生。因为我感到到了某一天对露西可能是一种安慰，否则，她可能认为达尔内的生命是被人随意抛弃了的、浪费了的，因而感到痛苦。”\n “是的，是的，是的，”罗瑞先生擦着眼泪回答，“你说得不错。但是他会死的，真正的希望并不存在。”\n “是的，他会死的，真正的希望并不存在，”卡尔顿应声回答，然后踏着坚定的步子走下楼去。\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/74/4133.html","bookId":543,"book":{"id":543,"title":"A Tale of Two Cities双城记","description":"简介： A Tale of Two Cities (1859) is a novel by Charles Dickens, set in London and Paris before and during the French Revolution.
