{"id":32881,"no":41,"title":"Book 3 Chapter 12 Darkness","content":"SYDNEY CARTON paused in the street, not quite decided where to go. `At Tellson\u0027s banking-house at nine,\u0027 he said, with a musing face. `Shall I do well, in the mean time, to show myself? I think so. It is best that these people should know there is such a man as I here; it is a sound precaution, and may be a necessary preparation. But care, care, care! Let me think it out!\u0027 Checking his steps, which had begun to tend towards an object, he took a turn or two in the already darkening street, and traced the thought in his mind to its possible consequences. His first impression was confirmed. `It is best,\u0027 he said, finally resolved, `that these people should know there is such a man as I here.\u0027 And he turned his face towards Saint Antoine. Defarge had described himself, that day, as the keeper of a wine-shop in the Saint Antoine suburb. It was not difficult for one who knew the city well, to find his house without asking any question. Having ascertained its situation, Carton came out of those closer streets again, and dined at a place of refreshment and fell sound asleep after dinner. For the first time in many years, he had no strong drink. Since last night he had taken nothing but a little light thin wine, and last night he had dropped the brandy slowly down on Mr. Lorry\u0027s hearth like a man who had done with it. It was as late as seven o\u0027clock when he awoke refreshed, and went out into the streets again. As he passed along towards Saint Antoine, he stopped at a shop-window where there was a mirror, and slightly altered the disordered arrangement of his loose cravat, and his coat-collar, and his wild hair. This done, he went on direct to Defarge\u0027s, and went in. There happened to be no customer in the shop but Jacques Three, of the restless fingers and the croaking voice. This man, whom he had seen upon the Jury, stood drinking at the little counter, in conversation with the Defarges, man and wife. The Vengeance assisted in the conversation, like a regular member of the establishment. He repeated what he had already said. `English?\u0027 asked Madame Defarge, inquisitively raising her dark eyebrows. After looking at her, as if the sound of even a single French word were slow to express itself to him, he answered, in his former strong foreign accent, `Yes, madame, yes. I am English!\u0027 Madame Defarge returned to her counter to get the wine, and, as he took up a Jacobin journal and feigned to pore over it puzzling out its meaning, he heard her say, `I swear to you, like Evrémonde!\u0027 Defarge brought him the wine, and gave him Good Evening. `How?\u0027 `Good evening.\u0027 `Oh! Good evening, citizen,\u0027 filling his glass. `Ah! and good wine. I drink to the Republic.\u0027 Defarge went back to the counter, and said, `Certainly, a little like.\u0027 Madame sternly retorted, `I tell you a good deal like.\u0027 Jacques Three pacifically remarked, `He is so much in your mind, see you, madame.\u0027 The amiable Vengeance added, with a laugh, `Yes, my faith! And you are looking forward with so much pleasure to seeing him once more to-morrow!\u0027 `It is true what madame says,\u0027 observed Jacques Three. `Why stop? There is great force in that. Why stop?\u0027 `Well, well,\u0027 reasoned Defarge, `but one must stop somewhere. After all, the question is still where?\u0027 `At extermination,\u0027 said madame. `Magnificent!\u0027 croaked Jacques Three. The Vengeance, also, highly approved. `Extermination is good doctrine, my wife,\u0027 said Defarge, rather troubled; `in general, I say nothing against it. But this Doctor has suffered much; you have seen him to-day; you have observed his face when the paper was read.\u0027 `I have observed his face!\u0027 repeated madame, contemptuously and angrily. `Yes. I have observed his face. I have observed his face to be not the face of a true friend of the Republic. Let him take care of his face!\u0027 `And you have observed, my wife,\u0027 said Defarge, in a deprecatory manner, `the anguish of his daughter, which must be a dreadful anguish to him!\u0027 `I have observed his daughter,\u0027 repeated madame; `yes, I have observed his daughter, more times than one. I have observed her to-day, and I have observed her other days. I have observed her in the court, and I have observed her in the street by the prison. Let me but lift my finger---!\u0027 She seemed to raise it (the listener\u0027s eyes were always on his paper), and to let it fall with a rattle on the ledge before her, as if the axe had dropped. `The citizeness is superb!\u0027 croaked the Juryman. `She is an Angel!\u0027 said The Vengeance, and embraced her. `As to thee,\u0027 pursued madame, implacably, addressing her husband, `if it depended on thee--which, happily, it does not--thou wouldst rescue this man even now. `No!\u0027 protested Defarge. `Not if to lift this glass would do it! But I would leave the matter there. I say, stop there.\u0027 `See you then, Jacques,\u0027 said Madame Defarge, wrathfully; `and see you, too, my little Vengeance; see you both! Listen! For other crimes as tyrants and oppressors, I have this race a long time on my register, doomed to destruction and extermination. Ask my husband, is that so.\u0027 `It is so,\u0027 assented Defarge, without being asked. `In the beginning of the great days, when the Bastille falls, he finds this paper of to-day, and he brings it home, and in the middle of the night when this place is clear and shut, we read it, here on this spot, by the light of this lamp. Ask him, is that so.\u0027 `It is so,\u0027 assented Defarge. `That night, I tell him, when the paper is read through, and the lamp is burnt out, and the day is gleaming in above those shutters and between those iron bars, that I have now a secret to communicate. Ask him, is that so.\u0027 `It is so,\u0027 assented Defarge again. `I communicate to him that secret. I smite this bosom with these two hands as I smite it now, and I tell him, \"Defarge, I was brought up among the fishermen of the sea-shore, and that peasant family so injured by the two Evrémonde brothers, as that Bastille paper describes, is my family. Defarge, that sister of the mortally wounded boy upon the ground was my sister, that husband was my sister\u0027s husband, that unborn child was their child, that brother was my brother, that father was my father, those dead are my dead, and that summons to answer for those things descends to me!\" Ask him, is that so.\u0027 `It is so,\u0027 assented Defarge once more. `Then tell Wind and Fire where to stop,\u0027 returned madame; `but don\u0027t tell me.\u0027 Both her hearers derived a horrible enjoyment from the deadly nature of her wrath--the listener could feel how white she was, without seeing her--and both highly commended it. Defarge, a weak minority, interposed a few words for the memory of the compassionate wife of the Marquis; but only elicited from his own wife a repetition of her last reply. `Tell the Wind and the Fire where to stop; not me!\u0027 Customers entered, and the group was broken up. The English customer paid for what he had had, perplexedly counted his change, and asked, as a stranger, to be directed towards the National Palace. Madame Defarge took him to the door, and put her arm on his, in pointing out the road. The English customer was not without his reflections then, that it might be a good deed to seize that arm, lilt it, and strike under it sharp and deep. But, he went his way, and was soon swallowed up in the shadow of the prison wall. At the appointed hour, he emerged from it to present himself in Mr. Lorry\u0027s room again, where he found the old gentleman walking to and fro in restless anxiety. He said he had been with Lucie until just now, and had only left her for a few minutes, to come and keep his appointment. Her father had not been seen, since he quitted the banking house towards four o\u0027clock. She had some faint hopes that his mediation might save Charles, but they were very slight. He had been more than five hours gone: where could he be? They were discussing this question, and were almost building up some weak structure of hope on his prolonged absence, when they heard him on the stairs. The instant he entered the room, it was plain that all was lost. Whether he had really been to any one, or whether he had been all that time traversing the streets, was never known. As he stood staring at them, they asked him no question, for his face told them everything. `I cannot find it,\u0027 said he, `and I must have it. Where is it?\u0027 His head and throat were bare, and, as he spoke with a helpless look straying all around, he took his coat off, and let it drop on the floor. `Where is my bench? I have been looking everywhere for my bench, and I can\u0027t find it. What have they, done with my work? Time presses: I must finish those shoes. They looked at one another, and their hearts died within them. `Come, come!\u0027 said he, in a whimpering miserable way; `let me get to work. Give me my work.\u0027 Receiving no answer, he tore his hair, and beat his feet upon the ground, like a distracted child. `Don\u0027t torture a poor forlorn wretch,\u0027 he implored them, with a dreadful cry; `but give me my work! What is to become of us, if those shoes are not done to-night?\u0027 Lost, utterly lost! It was so clearly beyond hope to reason with him, or try to restore him,--that--as if by agreement--they each put a hand upon his shoulder, and soothed him to sit down before the fire, with a promise that he should have his work presently. He sank into the chair, and brooded over the embers, and shed tears. As if all that had happened since the garret time were a momentary fancy, or a dream, Mr. Lorry saw him shrink into the exact figure that Defarge had had in keeping. Affected, and impressed with terror as they both were, by this spectacle of ruin, it was not a time to yield to such emotions. His lonely daughter, bereft of her final hope and reliance, appealed to them both too strongly. Again, as if by agreement, they looked at one another with one meaning in their faces. Carton was the first to speak: `The last chance is gone: It was not much. Yes; he had better be taken to her. But, before you go, will you, for a moment, steadily attend to me? Don\u0027t ask me why I make the stipulations I am going to make, and exact the promise I am going to exact; I have a reason--a good one.\u0027 `I do not doubt it,\u0027 answered Mr. Lorry. `Say on.\u0027 The figure in the chair between them, was all the time monotonously rocking itself to and fro, and moaning. They spoke in such a tone as they would have used if they had been watching by a sick-bed in tile night. Carton stooped to pick up the coat, which lay almost entangling his feet. As he did so, a small case in which the Doctor was accustomed to carry the list of his day\u0027s duties, fell lightly on the floor. Carton took it up, and there was a folded paper in it. `We should look at this!\u0027 he said. Mr. Lorry nodded his consent. He opened it, and exclaimed, `Thank GOD\u0027 `What is it?\u0027 asked Mr. Lorry, eagerly. `A moment! Let me speak of it in its place. First,\u0027 he put his hand in his coat, and took another paper from it, `that is the certificate which enables me to pass out of this city. Look at it. You see--Sydney Carton, an Englishman?\u0027 Mr. Lorry held it open in his hand, gazing in his earnest face. `Keep it for me until to-morrow. I shall see him to-morrow, you remember; and I had better not take it into the prison.\u0027 `Why not?\u0027 `I don\u0027t know; I prefer not to do so. Now, take this paper that Doctor Manette has carried about him. It is a similar certificate, enabling him and his daughter and her child at any time, to pass the barrier and the frontier? You see?\" `Yes!\u0027 `Perhaps he obtained it as his last and utmost precaution against evil, yesterday. When is it dated? But no matter; don\u0027t stay to look; put it up carefully wit!, mine and your own. Now, observe! I never doubted until within this hour or two, tat he had, or could have such a paper. It is good, until recalled. But it may be soon recalled, and, I have reason to think, will be.\u0027 `They are not in danger?\u0027 `They are in great danger. They are in danger of denunciation by Madame Defarge. I know it from her own lips. I have overheard words of that woman\u0027s, to-night, which have presented their danger to me in strong colours. I have lost no time, and since then, I have seen the spy. He confirms me. He knows that a wood-sawyer, living by the prison-wall, is under the control of the Defarges, and has been rehearsed by Madame Defarge as to his having seen Her\u0027--he never mentioned Lucie\u0027s name--\u0027making signs and signals to prisoners. It is easy to foresee that the pretence will be the common one, a prison plot, and that it will involve her life--and perhaps her child\u0027s--and perhaps her father\u0027s--for both have been seen with her at that place. Don\u0027t look so horrified. You will save them all.\u0027 `Heaven grant I may, Carton! But how?\u0027 `I am going to tell you how. It will depend on you, and it could depend on no better man. This new denunciation will certainly not take place until after to-morrow; probably not until two or three days afterwards; more probably a week afterwards. You know it is a capital crime, to mourn for, or sympathise with, a victim of the Guillotine. She and her father would unquestionably be guilty of this crime, and this woman (the inveteracy of whose pursuit cannot be described) would wait to add that strength to her case, and make herself doubly sure. You follow me?\u0027 `So attentively, and with so much confidence in what you say, that for the moment I lose sight,\u0027 touching the back of the Doctor\u0027s chair, `even of this distress.\u0027 `You have money, and can buy the means of travelling to tile Sea-coast as quickly as the journey can be made. Your preparations have been completed for some days, to return to England. Early to-morrow have your horses ready, so that they may be in starting trim at two o\u0027clock in the afternoon.\u0027 `It shall be done!\u0027 His manner was so fervent and inspiring, that Mr. Lorry caught the flame, and was as quick as youth. `You are a noble heart. Did I say we could depend upon no better man? Tell her, to-night, what you know of her danger as involving her child and her father. Dwell upon that, for she would lay her own fair head beside her husband\u0027s cheerfully.\u0027 He faltered for an instant; then went on as before. `For the sake of her child and her father, press upon her the necessity of leaving Paris, with them and you, at that hour. Tell her that it was her husband\u0027s last arrangement. Tell her that more depends upon it than she dare believe, or hope. You think that her father, even in this sad state, will submit himself to her; do you not?\u0027 `I am sure of it.\u0027 `I thought so. Quietly and steadily have all these arrangements made in the court-yard here, even to the taking of your own seat in the carriage. The moment I come to you, take me in, and drive away.\u0027 `I understand that I wait for you under all circumstances?\u0027 `You have my certificate in your hand with the rest, you know, and will reserve my place. Wait for nothing but to have my place occupied, and then for England!\u0027 `Why, then,\u0027 said Mr. Lorry, grasping his eager but so firm and steady hand, `it does not all depend on one old man, but I shall have a young and ardent man at my side.\u0027 `Nothing, Carton.\u0027 `Remember these words to-morrow: change the course, or delay in it--for any reason--and no life can possibly be saved, and many lives must inevitably be sacrificed.\u0027 `I will remember them. I hope to do my part faithfully.\u0027 `And I hope to do mine. Now, good-bye!\u0027 Though he said it with a grave smile of earnestness, and though lie even put the old man\u0027s hand to his lips, he did not part from him then. He helped him so far to arouse the rocking figure before the dying embers, as to get a cloak and hat put upon it, and to tempt it forth to find where the bench and work were hidden that it still moaningly besought to have. He walked on the other side of it and protected it to the court-yard of the house where the afflicted heart--so happy in the memorable time when he had revealed his own desolate heart to it--outwatched the awful night. He entered the court-yard and remained there for a few moments alone, loping up at the light in the window of her room. Before he went away, he breathed a blessing towards it, and a Farewell. 他正往一个目标走去，却站住了，走上了已经黑下来的街道。他拐了一两个弯，掂量着心里想法的可能后果。他肯定了自己第一个印象。“最好是，”他终于下定了决心，“让这些人知道这儿有一个像我这样的人。”于是他转过身往圣安托万区走去。 那天德伐日曾说明他是圣安托万郊区的酒店老板。熟悉那城市的人是不必打听就能找到他那房子的。弄清了那屋子的位置之后，卡尔顿先生从狭窄的街道走了出来，到一家小吃店用了晚餐，吃完饭便睡着了。多少年来他是第一次没有喝烈性酒。从昨晚至今他只喝了一点度数不高的淡酒。昨天晚上他已把白兰地缓缓倒进了罗瑞先生家的壁炉里，仿佛从此跟它一刀两断了。 等他一觉醒来，头脑清醒，已是七点。他又上了街。在去圣安托万的路上他在一家橱窗前站了站。那儿有一面镜子，他略微整了整他歪斜的蝴蝶结、外衣领子和蓬乱的头发，便径直来到德伐日酒店，走了进去。 店里碰巧没有顾客，只有那手指老抓挠着、声音低沉的雅克三号。这人他在陪审团里见过，此时正站在小柜尔前喝酒，跟德伐日夫妇聊天。复仇女神也像这家酒店的正式成员一样跟他们在一起谈话。 卡尔顿走进店里坐下，用很蹩脚的法语要了少量的酒。德伐日太太随便看了他一眼，随即仔细瞧了瞧他，然后又仔细打量了他一会儿，最后索性亲自走到他面前，问他要点什么。 他重复他已说过的话。 “英国人？”德伐日太太疑问地扬起她乌黑的眉毛问。 他看着她，仿佛这个法国字也费了他好大功夫才听懂，然后带着刚才那种强烈的外国调子回答道，“是的，太太，是的，我是英国人。” 德伐日太太回到柜台去取酒。在他拿起一张雅各宾党的报纸装出吃力地读着、猜测着它的意思时，他听见她说，“我向你发誓，真像埃佛瑞蒙德！” 德伐日给他送上酒，说了声“晚上好”。 “什么？” “晚上好。” “啊！晚上好，公民，”他往杯里斟酒。“啊！好酒。为共和国干杯。” 德伐日回到柜台边说，“确实有点像。”老板娘板起面孔反驳，“我说很像。”雅克三号息事宁人说，“那是因为你心里老挂着那个人，你明白么，老板娘。”复仇女神快活地笑着说，“不错，说得对！你满心欢喜等着明天跟他再见一面呢！” 卡尔顿用手指慢馒指着报纸全神贯注、一字一行地苦读着。那几个人胳膊放在拒台上挤在一起低声交谈。他们只顾端详他，沉默了好一会儿，没有干扰他对雅各宾派报纸编辑的专心，然后又谈了起来。 “好了，好了，”德伐日说，“总得到一个地方为止吧！那么到什么地方为止呢？” “到斩草除根为止，”老板娘说。 “太好了：”雅克三号用低沉的嗓音说。复仇女神也非常赞成。 “斩草除根是个好理论，老婆，”德伐日颇感到为难，“大体说来我并不反对。但是这位医生受了太多的苦，他今天的情况你是看见的，宣读手稿的时候你也观察过他的脸。”， “我观察过他的脸，”老板娘生起气来，轻蔑地说。“是的，我观察过他的脸。我观察出他那张脸不是共和国的真正朋友的脸。对他那张脸他还是小心为好！” “你也观察到，老婆，”德伐日央求道，“他女儿的痛苦，这对医生也是一种可怕的折磨！”’ “我观察过他的女儿，”老板娘重复他的话，“不错，我观察过他的女儿，不止一次地观察过。我今天观察过，其它的时候也观察过。在法庭里观察过，在监狱旁的街道上也观察过。我只须举起一个指头＿＿”她大约举起了指头（旁听者的眼睛一直盯着报纸），哗一声砍在而前的货架上，仿佛是斧头砍下的。 “优秀的女公民，”陪审员低沉着噪子说。 “简直是天使！”复仇女神说着拥抱了她一下。 “至于你么，”老板娘对她的丈夫毫不客气地说，“幸好这事不由你决定，若是由你决定，你怕是现在就会去救那个人的。” “不！”德伐日抗议。“哪怕就是举起这只杯子就可以救他，我也不会的！但是我希望到此为止。我说，到此为止。” “你看看，雅克，”德伐日太太怒火中烧地说，“你也看看，我的小复仇。你们俩都来看！听着！在我的记录上我还记载着这个家族其它的横行霸道、欺压百姓的罪行，而且注定要消灭，斩草除根。你们问我当家的，是不是这样。” “是这样，”德伐日不问自答。 “伟大的日子刚开始，攻陷巴士底狱的时候他找到了今天的那份手稿，带回家来，等到半夜里关了门再没有人的时候，我们就是在这个地点、这盏灯下一起读的。问他，是不是这样。” “是这样，”德伐日同意。 “那天晚上，手稿读完，灯也熄了，百叶窗和栅栏外天已经开始蒙蒙亮。那时我才跟他讲，我要告诉他一个秘密。问问他，是不是这样。” “是这样，”德伐日第二次承认。 “我把那秘密告诉了他。我用这两只手像现在这样捶打着我的胸口告诉他，‘德伐日，我是在海边的渔民家长大的。那份巴士底狱手稿上描写的受尽埃佛瑞蒙德弟兄残害的农民家庭就是我的家庭，德伐日，那受了致命伤躺在地上的少年的姐姐，便是我的姐姐，那丈夫便是我姐姐的丈夫，那个还没见天日的孩子便是他俩的孩子，那父亲便是我的父亲，那些死去的人都是我的亲骨肉，那清算血债的召唤是落在我身上的。问问他，是不是这样。” “是这样，”德伐日又一次承认。 “那你就去告诉风和火如何到此为此吧，”老板娘回答，“别来跟我废话。” 听她说话的那两个人从她那必欲置于死地而后快的震怒里得到了一种令人恐怖的享受，两人都对她的话大加赞扬一—那旁听者虽没看着她，却也感到她早已一脸煞白。德伐日成了微弱的少数派，说了几句“应当记住很同情他们的侯爵夫人”之类的话，可他的妻子却只重复了最后的那句话作为回答，“去告诉风和火加何到此为止吧，别来跟我废话。” 有顾客进门，几个人散开了。英国顾客付了帐，很费劲地数清找给他的钱，又以陌生人的身份打听去国家宫的路。德伐日太太带他到门口，手臂靠在他的手臂上，指给他路。英国顾客并非没有反应：若是能抓住那胳膊往上一抬，再深深扎进一刀，倒也是一大善举。 但是，他仍走上了自己的路，不久便被监狱墙壁的黑影吞没了。到了约定的时刻他才走出黑影到罗瑞先生家赴约。他发现那位老先生在不停地走来走去。罗瑞先生很焦急地说他一直陪着露西，是几分钟前才赶到这边来的。露西的父亲四点时离开银行，至今没有回来。露西抱着几分希望，但愿他的干预可能救出查尔斯，但希望很渺茫。他已经一去五个多钟头，可能到什么地方去了呢？ 罗瑞先生，一直等到十点，曼内特医生仍然没有消息，老离开露西他又不放心，便作好安排：他自己先回露西那儿去，半夜再回银行来。当中这段时间就由卡尔顿一个人在炉火前等候医生。 卡尔顿等了又等，时钟敲了十二点，曼内特医生没有回来。罗瑞先生却回来了，可他也没听见他的消息。医生究竟是到哪儿去了？ 他们正在讨论这个问题，因他久久不归差不多产生了几分希望。这时却传未了医生上楼的脚步声。他一进门一切便明白了：完了。 他是真去找过谁，还是一直在街上转悠，没有人知道。他站在那儿呆望着他们。他们却没有问他，因为他那张脸已说明了一切。 “我找不到了，”他说，“我一定得找到。它到哪儿去了？” 他光着头，敞着领子，无可奈何地东望望西望望说。他脱掉了外衣，却让它落到地上。 “我的凳子呢？我哪儿都找遍了，找不着。我的活几呢？他们把它弄哪儿去了？时间很紧，我得做完鞋。” 两人彼此看看：彻底完了。． “好了，好了！”他痛苦地低声说，“让我工作吧。把我的活儿给我。” 他得不到回答便扯头发、顿脚，像个任性的孩子。 “不要折磨一个可怜的孤老头子吧，”他凄苦地叫着乞求他们，“把活儿给我！若是今天晚上鞋做不完，我们怎么得了？” 完了，全完了！ 想跟他讲道理，想使他清醒，都显然无济于事。他俩仿佛配合默契，—人伸出一只手放在他肩上，劝他在炉火前坐下，而且告诉他马上给他找到活计。医生倒在椅子里呆望着灰烬，流起泪来。罗瑞先生眼看他又完全缩回到了当初德伐日照顾他时的模样，仿佛阁楼时期以后所发生的一切都不过是瞬间的幻觉。 尽管两人都为这种心灵毁灭的惨象感到恐惧，时间却不容他们流露自已的情绪。他那孤苦伶仃的女儿太令两人难过，她已失去了最后的希望和依傍。两人再度表现出默契，彼此望望，脸上表现了同一个意思。卡尔顿第一个说话： “本来机会就不多，可现在连身后的机会都没有了。是的，医生最好还是到他女儿那儿去。但是在你离开之前你能否用一点时间仔细听我讲一讲？我要提出一些条件，还要你答应我做一些事情＿＿别问我理由，我有理由，有充分的理由。” “这我不怀疑，”罗瑞先生回答，“说吧！” 那坐在两人之间的人，—直在单调地一起一伏地呜咽着。两人用夜间守候在病床边的人的口气交谈起来。 卡尔顿弯下腰去拾医生的外衣—一它几乎绊住了他的脚。一个小盒子滑落到了地板上，那是医生用来登记他的工作日程的。卡尔顿拾了起来，其中有一张折好的纸条。“我们应当看一看！”他说。罗瑞先生点头同意。卡尔顿打开纸条，惊叫道，“谢谢上帝！” “是什么？”罗瑞先生急忙问道。 “等一等！这个到时候再说，”他从衣服口袋里取出另一张纸条，“首先，这是我的通行证。瞧，西德尼.卡尔顿，英国人，是么？” 罗瑞先生捧着打开的纸条，望着他那认真的脸。 “把这东西为我保留到明天。你记得，我明天要去看看尔斯，这通行证我最好还是不带进监狱去的好。” “为什么？” “我说不清，总觉得还是不带的好。你拿好曼内特医生身上的这张证明。这是一份同样的证件，有了它他跟他的女儿和外孙便可以随时通过路障和边界，对不对？你看清楚了没有？” “看清楚了！” “他也许是昨天弄到这张证明的，是准备应付不幸的最后手段。是哪一天签发的？不过那关系不大，不用看了，把它跟我和你的证明一起仔细保存好。注意！在一两个钟头以前我一直相信他已经有了或是可能已签到了这样的证明。这证明在吊销之前是有效的，但是它也许会立即被吊销，而且我有理由相信它是会被吊销的。” “难道连他们也有了危险？” “非常危险。他们可能受到德伐日太太的控告。这是我听见她亲口讲的。今天晚上我从旁听到了那女人的话，口气十分严厉，才知道她俩也有了危险。我没有浪费时间，立即去找了行个密探，他也证实了我的看法。他知道德伐日夫妇掌握着一个锯木工，那人住在监狱大墙边。德伐日太太已经跟他排练过了，要他说，‘见到过她’＿＿他从不提露西的名字——‘跟囚犯打手势，发暗号。’捏造的罪名不难估计，很平常的：搞监狱阴谋。那会给她带来生命危险，说不定连她的孩子，也许连她的父亲都保不住，因为也有人看见他们俩在大墙边。用不着满脸惊惶，你是可以救他们的。” “愿上天保佑我真能办到，卡尔顿！可是我怎么能救他们呢？” “我来告诉你吧。这得要靠你了，你是最可靠的人。这次揭发肯定要在明天以后才进行，说不定要在两三天之后，更有可能到一周以后。你知道对断头台的牺牲品表示哀悼或是同情是杀头的罪名。她和她父亲无疑会被指控犯了这种罪，而这个女人（她那恶不、一意孤行的脾气简直难以描述）是会等待时机把这一条罪名加上去，使自己立于不败之地的。你明白我的意思么？” “我听得很认真，也很相信你的话，一时连他的痛苦都忘掉了，”他说着摸了摸医生的椅背。 “你有钱，只要可以安排离开就能雇到交通工具。要以最快速度去海边。你已经做了准备要回英格兰几天。明天一大早把马车准备好，下午两点钟出发。” “一定做好准备。” 卡尔顿热心热肠，令人鼓舞，罗瑞先生被他的火焰点燃了，痛快得有如年轻人。 “你心胸高贵，我不是说过你是最可靠的人么？今天晚上把你所知道的情况告诉她：她自己的危险、她的孩子和父亲的危险。强调孩子和父亲的危险，因为她是可以把自己美丽的头跟她丈夫的头欢欢喜喜放在一起的。”他迟疑了一会儿，然后像刚才一样继续说下去，“让她明白，为了孩子和父亲的安全她必须在那个时刻带着他俩和你一起离开巴黎。告诉她，这是她丈夫作出的最后安排。告诉她，此举可能会产生她不敢相信、也不敢希望的结果。你相信她的父亲即使在目前这种悲惨的状况下也会服从她么？” “我相信会的。” “我也相信。不声不响、扎扎实实、好好准备吧！等在下面院子里，甚至上车去坐好。只等我一到就让我上车出发。” “你的意思是要我无论出现什么情况都要等你么？” “你手上有我和别人的通行证，你知道，而且要给我留好座位。别的你都不管，只等我的座位坐上人就回英格兰。” “这样说来，”罗瑞先生说，抓住他那急切而坚定的手，“这事靠的就不只是一个老头了，我身边还有一个热情的青年呢！” “上天保佑，确实如此！请向我庄严保证，我俩此刻互相承诺完成的计划不会因任何影响而改变。” “我保证，卡尔顿。”， “明天要牢记这句话：无论由于什么原因，只要一改变了计划，或是拖延了时间，那就会救不了命的。好几条命就会白白断送。” “我记住了。我希望可靠地完成任务。” “我也希望完成我的任务。再见！” 虽然他郑重其事地笑了笑，甚至还把老人的手放到唇边吻了吻，却没有立即走掉。他帮助他唤醒了那在炉火前一起一伏的病人，给他穿上大衣，戴上帽于，劝他去寻找隐藏板凳和活计的地点，因为他还呜咽着要找，他走在病人的另一边，保护着他来到了另一座楼的院子里。那里有一颗痛苦的心正经受着漫漫长夜的可怕煎熬——在一个值得纪念的日子里，他曾向那颗心坦露过自己孤独寂寞的心，那曾是他的幸福时刻。他走进院子，抬头凝望着她屋里的灯，独自伫立许久，才在向灯光发出祝福后告别离开。","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/74/4134.html","bookId":543,"book":{"id":543,"title":"A
