{"id":32875,"no":35,"title":"Book 3 Chapter 6 Triumph","content":"THE dread Tribunal of five Judges, Public Prosecutor, and determined Jury, sat every day. Their lists went forth every evening, and were read out by the gaolers of the various prisons to their prisoners. The standard gaoler-joke was, `Come out and listen to the Evening Paper, you inside there!\u0027\n `Charles Evrémonde, called Darnay!\u0027 So at last began the Evening Paper at La Force.\n When a name was called, its owner stepped apart into a spot reserved for those who were announced as being thus fatally recorded. Charles Evrémonde, called Darnay, had reason to know the usage; he had seen hundreds pass away so.\n His bloated gaoler, who wore spectacles to read with, glanced over them to assure himself that he had taken his place, and went through the list, making a similar short pause at each name. There were twenty-three names, but only twenty here responded to; for one of the prisoners so summoned had died in gaol and been forgotten, and two had already been guillotined and forgotten. The list was read, in the vaulted chamber where Darnay had seen the associated prisoners on the night of his arrival. Every one of those had perished in the massacre; every human creature he had since cared for and parted with, had died on the scaffold.\n The passage to the Conciergerie was short and dark; the night in its vermin-haunted cells was long and cold. Next day, fifteen prisoners were put to the bar before Charles Darnay\u0027s name was called. All the fifteen were condemned, and the trials of the whole occupied an hour and a half.\n `Charles Evrémonde, called Darnay,\u0027 was at length arraigned.\n Charles Evrémonde, called Darnay, was accused by the public prosecutor as an emigrant, whose life was forfeit to the Republic, under the decree which banished all emigrants on pain of Death. It was nothing that the decree bore date since his return to France. There he was, and there was the decree; he had been taken in France, and his head was demanded.\n `Take off his head!\u0027 cried the audience. `An enemy to the Republic!\u0027\n The President rang his bell to silence those cries, and asked the prisoner whether it was not true that he had lived many years in England?\n Undoubtedly it was.\n Was he not an emigrant then? What did he call himself? \n Not an emigrant, he hoped, within the sense and spirit of the law.\n Why not? the President desired to know.\n What proof had he of this?\n He handed in the names of two witnesses: Théophile Gabelle, and Alexandre Manette.\n But he had married in England? the President reminded him.\n True, but not an English woman. \n A citizeness of France? \n Yes. By birth. \n Her name and family?\n `Lucie Manette, only daughter of Doctor Manette, the good physician who sits there.\u0027\n This answer had a happy effect upon the audience. Cries in exaltation of the well-known good physician rent the hall. So capriciously were the people moved, that tears immediately rolled down several ferocious countenances which had been glaring at the prisoner a moment before, as if with impatience to pluck him out into the streets and kill him.\n On these few steps of his dangerous way, Charles Darnay had set his foot according to Doctor Manette\u0027s reiterated instructions. The same cautious counsel directed every step that lay before him, and had prepared every inch of his road.\n The President asked, why had he returned to France when he did, and not sooner? \n He had not returned sooner, he replied, simply because he had no means of living in France, save those he had resigned; whereas, in England, he lived by giving instruction in the French language and literature. He had returned when he did, on the pressing and written entreaty of a French citizen, who represented that his life was endangered by his absence. He had come back, to save a citizen\u0027s life, and to bear his testimony, at whatever personal hazard, to the truth. Was that criminal in the eyes of the Republic?\n The populace cried enthusiastically, `No!\u0027 and the President rang his bell to quiet them. Which it did not, for they continued to cry `No!\u0027 until they left of of their own will.\n The President required the name of that citizen? The accused explained that the citizen was his first witness. He also referred with confidence to the citizen\u0027s letter, which had been taken from him at the Barrier, but which he did not doubt would be found among the papers then before the President.\n Doctor Manette was next questioned. His high personal popularity, and the clearness of his answers, made a great impression; but, as he proceeded, as he showed that the Accused was his first friend on his release from his long imprisonment; that, the accused had remained in England, always faithful and devoted to his daughter and himself in their exile; that, so far from being in favour with the Aristocrat government there, he had actually been tried for his life by it, as the foe of England and friend of the United States--as he brought these circumstances into view, with the greatest discretion and with the straightforward force of truth and earnestness, the Jury and the populace became one. At last, when he appealed by name to Monsieur Lorry, an English gentleman then and there present, who, like himself, had been a witness on that English trial and could corroborate his account of it, the Jury declared that they had heard enough, and that they were ready with their votes if the President were content to receive them.\n At every vote (the Jurymen voted aloud and individually), the populace set up a shout of applause. All the voices were in the prisoner\u0027s favour, and the President declared him free.\n Then, began one of those extraordinary scenes with which the populace sometimes gratified their fickleness, or their better impulses towards generosity and mercy, or which they regarded as some set off against their swollen account of cruel rage. No man can decide now to which of these motives such extraordinary scenes were referable; it is probable, to a blending of all the three, with the second predominating. No sooner was the acquittal pronounced, than tears were shed as freely as blood at another time, and such fraternal embraces were bestowed upon the prisoner by as many of both sexes as could rush at him, that after his long and unwholesome confinement he was in danger of fainting from exhaustion; none the less because he knew very well, that the very same people, carried by another current, would have rushed at him with the very same intensity, to rend him to pieces and strew him over the streets.\n His removal, to make way for other accused persons who were to be tried, rescued him from these caresses for the moment. Five were to be tried together, next, as enemies of the Republic, forasmuch as they had not assisted it by word or deed. So quick was the Tribunal to compensate itself and the nation for a chance lost, that these five came down to him before he left the place, condemned to die within twenty-four hours. The first of them told him so, with the customary prison sign of Death--a raised finger--and they all added in words, `Long live the Republic.\u0027\n The five had had, it is true, no audience to lengthen their proceedings, for when he and Doctor Manette emerged from the gate, there was a great crowd about it, in which there seemed to be every face he had seen in Court--except two, for which he looked in vain. On his coming out, the concourse made at him anew, weeping, embracing, and shouting, all by turns and all together, until the very tide of the river on the bank of which the mad scene was acted, seemed to run mad, like the people on the shore.\n They put him into a great chair they had among them, and which they had taken either out of the Court itself, or one of its rooms or passages. Over the chair they had thrown a red flag, and to the back of it they had bound a pike with a red cap on its top. In this car of triumph, not even the Doctor\u0027s entreaties could prevent his being carried to his home on men\u0027s shoulders, with a confused sea of red caps heaving about him, and casting up to sight from the stormy deep such wrecks of faces, that he more than once misdoubted his mind being in confusion, and that he was in the tumbril on his way to the Guillotine.\n In wild dreamlike procession, embracing whom they met and pointing him out, they carried him on. Reddening the snowy streets with the prevailing Republican colour, in winding and tramping through them, as they had reddened them below the snow with a deeper dye, they carried him thus into the court-yard of the building where he lived. Her father had gone on before, to prepare her, and when her husband stood upon his feet, she dropped insensible in his arms.\n As he held her to his heart and turned her beautiful head between his face and the brawling crowd, so that his tears and her lips might come together unseen, a few of the people fell to dancing. Instantly, all the rest fell to dancing, and the court-yard overflowed with the Carmagnole. Then, they elevated into the vacant chair a young woman from the crowd to be carried as the Goddess of Liberty, and then swelling and overflowing out into the adjacent streets, and along the river\u0027s bank, and over the bridge, the Carmagnole absorbed them every one and whirled them away.\n After grasping the Doctor\u0027s hand, as he stood victorious and proud before him; after grasping the hand of Mr. Lorry, who came panting in breathless from his struggle against the waterspout of the Carmagnole; after kissing little Lucie, who was lifted up to clasp her arms round his neck; and after embracing the ever zealous and faithful Pross who lifted her; he took his wife in his arms, and carried her up to their rooms. \n `Lucie! My own! I am safe.\u0027\n `O dearest Charles, let me thank God for this on my knees as I have prayed to Him.\u0027\n They all reverently bowed their heads and hearts. Then she was again in his arms, he said to hem:\n `And now speak to your father, dearest. No other man in all this France could have done what he has done for me.\u0027\n “查尔斯.埃佛瑞蒙德，又名达尔内。”\n 拉福斯的晚报终于这样开始了。\n 叫一个名字，那人就走到旁边一个地点去，那是专为这种名列生死簿上的人准备的地方。查尔斯.埃佛瑞蒙德，又名达尔内，有理由知道这种习惯。他见过成百的人这样一去不复返。\n 他那浮肿的典狱官念名单要戴眼镜，一边念，一边看犯人是否到位，每念一个名字都要停顿一下，然后再继续念，直到念完。念了二十三个名字，回答的只有二十个；有一个已死在牢里，被人忘掉了；另外两个早已上了断头台，也被人忘掉了。宣布名单的地方就是达尔内到达那天晚上犯人搞社交活动的屋子——有圆穹顶的。那批人在大屠杀中全死光了—一那以后他还曾想念过他们，却再也没见到过他们—一都死在断头台上了。\n 有匆匆的告别的话和祝愿，但很快便结束了——因为这是每天的例行公事，而拉福斯的人那天又忙着准备晚上的一个罚钱游戏和一个小型音乐会。有关的人挤到铁栅边去掉眼泪，可是计划中的文娱项目却少了二十个人，需要增补，而关门时间又已临近。时间太短了，到时候公用房间和走廊就要由獒犬通夜占领。囚犯们远远不是麻木不仁或缺乏同情心的，他们这种生活态度只是当时的条件逼成的罢了。同样，虽然有微妙的不同，某些人又无疑曾受到某种狂热和激动的支使去跟断头台作过徒然的斗争，结果死在断头台上。这并非言过其实，而是受到疯狂震撼的公众在心灵传染上的一种疯狂病。在瘟疫流行的时候，有人会受到那病的秘密吸引，产生一种可怕的偶然冲动，要想死于瘟疫，人们心里都有类似的奇怪倾向，只是有待环境诱发而已。\n 通向裁判所附属监狱的通道不长，但很黑暗；在它那满是蚤虱虫鼠的牢房里度过的夜晚寒冷而漫长。第二天，在叫到查尔斯.达尔内的名字之前己有十五个囚犯进了法庭。十五个人全部判了死刑，整个审讯只用了一个半小时。\n “查尔斯.埃佛瑞蒙德，又名达尔内”终于受到提审了。\n 他的法官们头戴饰有羽毛的帽子，坐在审判席上，别的人主要戴的是佩三色徽章的红色粗质便帽。看着陪审团和乱纷纷的观众，他可能以为正常秩序颠倒了过来，是罪犯在审判着正直的人呢！城市中最卑贱、最残忍、最邪恶的，而且从来没缺少过那份卑贱、残忍和邪恶劲的人现在成了主宰全场的精灵。他们或品头论足，或鼓掌喝彩，或大叫反对，或猜测估计，或推波助澜，一律是肆无忌惮。男人大部分带着某种正规武器，女人有的带短刀，有的带匕首，有的则一边看热闹，一边吃喝，许多女人打着毛线。在打毛线的妇女中有一个人手里打着线、腋下夹着线团，坐在前排一个男人身边。自从他离开城门之后，他便没再见过那男人，但他马上想起那就是德伐日。他注意到那女的在他耳边说过一两次话，便估计她是他的妻子。但是这两个人最令他注意的是，虽然都尽可能坐得离他近一点儿，却从来不瞧他一眼。他们好像下定了顽强的决心等待着什么，眼睛只望着陪审团，从不望别的。曼内特医生坐在庭长席下面的座位上，衣着朴素跟平时一样，就囚犯所见而言，只有他和罗瑞先生跟法庭无关，穿的也是日常服装，而不是粗糙的卡尔马尼奥拉装。\n 国民检察官控诉查尔斯.达尔内为外逃分子，按共和国流放一切外逃分子、潜回者处死的法律应判处死刑。法令公布日期虽在他回到法国以后，但不能影响判决。此时他已在法国，而法令又已公布，他已在法国被捕，因此要求判他死刑。\n “杀他的头！”观众大叫。“共和国的敌人！”\n 庭长摇铃要求肃静，然后问囚犯是否曾在英格兰居住多年。\n 毫无疑问。\n 那么他就不该算是外逃分子了，是么？他该怎么称呼自己？\n 他希望按法律的意义和精神解释，不属外逃分子之列。\n 为什么，庭长要求知道。\n 因为他早已自愿放弃了他所憎恶的一个称号，放弃了他所憎恶的一种地位，离开了他的国家，到英国靠自己的勤劳度日，而不是靠负担过重的法国人民的勤劳度日。他放弃时，目前为法庭所接受的外逃犯一词尚无人使用。\n 对此他有何证明？\n 他提出了两个证人的名字：泰奥菲尔．加伯尔和亚历山大．曼内特。\n 但是他在英格兰结了婚，是么？庭长提醒他。\n 是的，但对象不是英国人。\n 是法国女公民么？\n 是的。按出生国籍是的。\n 她叫什么名字？家庭？\n “叫露西．曼内特，曼内特医生的独生女。这位好医生就坐在卡尔马尼奥拉装：一七九二年左右在法国流行的一种服装，宽翻领短上衣（它本身就叫卡尔马尼奥拉衫），配黑色长裤，红色便帽和三色腰带。那儿。”\n 这句回答对听众产生了可喜的影响。赞美这位有名的好医生的叫喊声震动了大厅。受到感动的人们极其反复无常，几张凶恶的脸上立即珠泪滚滚，可刚才他们还咬牙切齿地瞪着他，仿佛按捺不住，要立即拉他上街杀掉。\n 查尔斯.达尔内按照曼内特医生一再嘱咐的路子踩着这危险路上的每一步。医生的谨慎意见指引着他面前的每一步，让他对每一个细节都做好了准备。\n 庭长问他为什么到那时候才回到法国，而没有早些回来？\n 他没有早些回来原因很简单，他回答道，因为他放弃了财产，在法国无以为生，而在英国他以教授法语和法国文学度日。他之所以在那时回来是因为一个法国公民的催促和书面请求，那人说明他若不回来他就有生命之虞。他是为了挽救一个公民的生命回来的，是不计一切个人安危来作证、来维护真理的。在共和国眼里这能算作犯罪么？\n 人群热情地高叫道，“不算！”庭长摇铃让大家肃静，可人们并不肃静，仍然叫着“不算！”直到叫够了才自行住嘴。\n 庭长问那公民是谁。被告说那公民便是他的第一个证人。他还很有把握地提起那人的信，那是在城门口从他身上取走的，他相信可以在庭长的卷宗中找到。\n 那信就在卷宗里——医生早安排好了，并向他保证过一定能找到。审讯到达这个阶段，找出了那信宣读了，又传公民加伯尔作证。加伯尔证明属实。公民加伯尔还极尽委婉和礼貌之能事暗示说，由于共和国的众多敌人给惩治敌人的法庭制造麻烦，形成了压力，他在修道院监狱稍稍受到了忽视，实际上己在相当程度上被法庭那忠于祖国的记忆所忘却，直到三天前才受到审讯。审讯他时，陪审团宣称由于公民埃佛瑞蒙德（又名达尔内）自动投案，回答了对他的指控，陪审团感到满意，因此释放了他。\n 然后传讯了曼内特医生。他崇高的声望和清晰的回答给了人们出色的印象。他继续指出被告是他在长期监禁获释后的第一位朋友，在他和他女儿客居海外时，他一气留在英国，对他俩一片赤诚，关怀备至。他又说，那儿的贵族政府很不喜欢被告，实际上曾经以英国的敌人和合众国的朋友的罪名对他进行过审判，意图杀害。医生依靠直接事实的威力和他自己的真诚，小心翼翼、字斟句酌地介绍了上述情况，于是陪审团的意见跟群众的意见统一了。最后他请求让此时在场的．，个英国人罗瑞先生作证。罗瑞先生曾跟他一样在英国那场审讯中作过证人，可以证明他对该审判的叙述属实。这时陪审团宣布他们听到的材料已经足够，若是庭长满意，他们可以立即投票了。\n 陪审团逐个唱名投票，每投一票群众便鼓掌欢呼，大家众口一词支持被告。庭长宣布被告无罪。\n 于是出现了一个极不寻常的场面。那是群众有时用以满足他们反复无常的心理，或是为了表现他们的宽容和慈悲的一种冲动，或是用以对消他们的暴戾恣睢和累累血债的。这种极不寻常的场面究竟产生于上述哪一种动机没有人说得清，可能是三种动机兼而有之，而以第二种为主吧！无罪释放的决定才一宣布，人们便热泪滚滚，跟别的场合热血直流时差不多。凡是能扑到他身边的人，不分男女都扑上来跟他拥抱。经过有损健康的长期囚禁的他差不多被累得昏死了过去。这也同样因为他很明白，同是这一批人，若是卷入了另一种潮流，也会以同样的激烈程度向他扑去，把他撕成碎块，满街乱扔。\n 还有别的被告要受审，他得退场，让出地方，这才使他从种种爱抚中脱出了身。下面还有五个人要同时以共和国敌人的罪名受到审判，因为他们并没有用言论或行动支持过它。法庭和国家在达尔内身上失去的机会很快就得到了补偿。达尔内还没离开法庭，那五个人已被判处死刑，二十四小时之内执行，被押到了他身边。五入中的第一个举起一根指头——那是监狱里常用的“死亡”暗语——告诉了他，这时他们全都接下去说，“共和国万岁！”\n 的确，那五个人再也没有观众陪他们活动了，因为人们在达尔内跟曼内特医生出门时已挤在了大门口。人群中似乎有他在法庭上见到的每一张面孔。只缺两张，他四处寻找，却没找到。他一出门，人群又涌向了他，又是哭泣，又是拥抱，又是喊叫，有时轮着班来，有时一涌而上。一片狂热直闹得脚下河边的河水也仿佛跟人们一样发起狂来。\n 人们从法庭里或是从某间屋子或过道里抬来了一张大椅子，把他塞了进去。他们在椅子上拉开了一面红旗，在椅背上捆上了一根长矛，矛尖上挂了一顶红便帽，便用肩膀把他用这辆胜利之车抬回了家，尽管医生一再请求都没挡住。他的周围涌动着一片乱纷纷的红便帽的海洋，从那风暴的深处掀起了许多死于这场海难的人的面影，使他多次怀疑自己是否已是神智不清，正坐着死囚车往断头台去。\n 人群抬着他向前走，像一个荒唐的梦中的游行队伍。他们见人就拥抱，并指出他叫人看。他们在街道上绕来绕去慢慢走着，用共和国的流行色照红了白雪覆盖的街道——他们也曾用更深的颜色染红了白雪的街道。他们就这样抬着他来到露西居住的大楼。她的父亲赶在前面去让她作好准备。等到她的丈夫下车站直身子，她便在他怀里晕了过去。\n 他把她搂在胸前，让她那美丽的头转向自己，背着喧嚣的人群，不让他们看到她的嘴唇跟他的眼泪融合到一起。有几个人开始跳起舞来，有的人便立即响应。院子里回荡起卡尔马尼奥拉歌的曲调。然后他们从人群里找了一个年轻妇女塞进空椅子当作自由女神高高地抬了起来。人群又横流放肆，泛滥到邻近的街道、堤岸和桥上，卡尔马尼奥拉歌吸引了每一个人，把他们卷了进去。\n 达尔内紧紧地握住医生的手，医生胜利而骄傲地站在他面前；他又紧握了罗瑞先生的手，罗瑞先生才从奔流的卡尔马尼奥拉队伍里挤过来，挤得气喘吁吁；达尔内亲了亲小露西，小露西被抱起来，她用小胳膊搂住他的脖子；他拥抱了永远热情忠诚的普洛丝，是普洛丝抱起小露西给他亲的。然后他才把妻子抱到怀里，带到楼上房里。\n “露西，我的露西，我平安了。”\n “啊，最亲爱的查尔斯，让我按照我的祷告跪下来感谢上帝吧！”\n 全家人都虔诚地低下了头，在心里致敬。等到她再次扑到他怀里时，他对她说：\n “现在告诉你的父亲吧，最亲爱的，他为我所做的事是全法国没有人能做到的。”\n 她把头靠到父亲胸前，跟许久以前父亲把头靠在她胸前一样。父亲因为能报答女儿而感到快乐，他所经受的苦难得到了报偿，他为自己的力量而骄傲。“你不能软弱呀，我亲爱的，”他抗议道，“不要这样发抖，我已经把他救出来了。”\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/74/4128.html","bookId":543,"book":{"id":543,"title":"A Tale of Two Cities双城记","description":"简介： A Tale of Two Cities (1859) is a novel by Charles Dickens, set in London and Paris before and during the French Revolution.
