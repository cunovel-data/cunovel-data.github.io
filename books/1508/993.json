The spirit ship crossed through space and activated the great void shift.\n In order to travel through a primary world of the Divine Realm, one had to use the great void shift. If they didn’t, it’d take tens of thousands of years or even hundreds of millions of years to fly from one end to another.\n The spirit ship flew higher and higher. Quickly, the primary world’s hundred thousand feet high mountains and hundred mile wide rivers turned vague, shrinking to little particles of dust. Even so, the primary world’s main continent was still endlessly broad. The size of a primary world was difficult to measure even when using trillions of miles as a unit.\n Lin Ming stood at a porthole and watched the endless void within the heavens of Atlas World, deeply shocked. Although he had already looked through jade slips for a brief introduction of the Divine Realm, he was still shocked by its vastness as he witnessed it with his own eyes!\n The great worlds of the Divine Realm not only included the primary world, but also the greater space that surrounded it as well as the countless celestial bodies in this space.\n Before, when the spirit ship underwent a great void shift just now, they had already traveled a trillion miles from the continent they were previously at. Along the way, Lin Ming saw almost limitless tiny shining spots in the sky, each spot representing a celestial star.\n In the universe, every celestial star represented a celestial body, coming in nearly infinite forms and shapes.\n These celestial stars were large and small. Some were blazing fire stars, some were massive planets, some were giant meteors, and some were even black holes that were known as the closest existence in the universe to grandmist energy.\n There were countless celestial stars, and most of them had extremely poor environments with nearly no heaven and earth origin. These were desolate stars, unsuited for the survival of mortals or martial artists.\n But there were some celestial stars with had rich heaven and earth origin energy and were full of life, vibrant, with many mortals living on them. The resources they had couldn’t compare with those on the primary world, but they were far superior to those of the lower realms. Amid these stars, Divine Sea masters, Divine Transformation masters, and even Divine Lord masters would emerge.\n There were even some stars that were developed by martial artists as their personal territories or abodes. These martial artists were often supreme elders of the Divine Realm. They kept themselves secluded from the world. But once they appeared, they would frighten an entire area.\n Whether it was ancient or current times, the stars that existed in the skies of a Divine Realm primary world always had martial artists living on them and powerhouses with their own hidden abodes. Naturally, there were countless lucky chances that were passed down through time. On these stars, there were an immeasurable number of rare treasures to obtain. There were caves of ancient vicious beasts and even hidden lairs of God Beasts. If one could fully explore these stars, the wealth they would find would be endless!\n Of course, even if a late Divine Lord realm powerhouse were to spend their entire life exploring these stars, they wouldn’t even manage to visit 1/100,000 of them.\n “Junior-apprentice Brother Lin, are you enjoying the scenery? Come on, this journey will last for 20-30 hours. Let’s go to the dining hall and get something to eat.” A tall man walked over to Lin Ming. He was Protector Liu who was responsible for the rookie disciples.\n Once a martial artist reached Lin Ming’s boundary, they could ward off hunger forever by absorbing heaven and earth origin energy for sustenance. Still, eating good meals brought about enjoyment and pleasure, and the food of Phoenix Cry Palace was made from refined heavenly materials. Eating this type of food was very beneficial to a martial artist’s cultivation.\n As they walked to the dining room, many people recognized Lin Ming along the way. They looked at him with a great deal of respect etched into their expressions, and some even made way for him to pass through. This was proof that Lin Ming’s prestige in Phoenix Cry Palace was already firmly established.\n The world was like this. If a person suddenly had a great accomplishment, they would often incur the envy and exclusion of others. These jealous people might think that this person’s successes were only due to luck, and some people would even want to wrest away his achievements. But if that person were to have an even greater accomplishment once again, then that’d be proof they had strength others could not rival. The other envious people would slowly shut up and their envy would be replaced by respect and awe instead.\n Lin Ming defeating Huo Yanguang had undoubtedly consolidated his position.\n Of course, there were no absolutes. There were still many people who imaged Lin Ming as their rival and took him as the goal they had to surpass in the future.\n “Zhou Fei, the one who passed us just now was Lin Ming. He’s the person in Phoenix Hall with the greatest limelight right now. Compared to him, we still have a long way to go.” After Lin Ming walked by, a blue robed man spoke to a man in red armor.\n “A long way? Yes, that’s right, the road I want to walk down is indeed long. But that is only the road to becoming a Palace Master or Holy Lord. As for Lin Ming, I will surpass him sooner or later. When I entered the sect, I only managed to enter into the lowest level Firebird Hall, but that is only because of my background. I’m not like that Lin Ming. I don’t have to latch onto the thigh of a Vice Palace master and have her recommend me to directly enter Phoenix Hall. If I want to enter Phoenix Hall, I can only do so by crossing the ninth stage of Life Destruction. Even with everything against me, I was still able to rely on my status as a Firebird Hall disciple to obtain first place amongst the rookie disciples in the qualification tournament!”\n As the red armored man spoke, his eyes flashed with a confident light. He had just reached the eighth stage of Life Destruction.\n The red armored man’s name was Zhou Fei. He came from common mortal origins and was a disciple of Firebird Hall. However, during the qualification tournament for the Ancient Phoenix smelting trial, Zhou Fei won from all his rivals. As a Firebird Hall disciple, he defeated all the other rookie talents of Golden Crow Hall and Vermillion Bird Hall, and managed to obtain first place. He currently enjoyed a very great limelight.\n However, what made Zhou Fei uncomfortable was that he thought he would soar into prominence this time and become the focus of the entire Phoenix Cry Palace. He thought that he’d be the next man of the hour after Lin Ming. That the Elders would realize they were blind to talent and would descend to Firebird Hall to wring their hands and praise him.\n But reality was not what he expected. He only caused a great stir within Firebird Hall and Golden Crow Hall and the worship of many young disciples there. In the second highest ranking Vermillion Bird Hall, he attracted jealousy and exclusion, and many even insisted he had only been lucky.\n As for the highest level Phoenix Hall, everyone there ignored him, no one was concerned about him from the start!\n Compared to the limelight that Lin Ming had created, him winning first place in the qualifications tournament was like comparing a tiny wave in front of a vast sea. It was simply insignificant.\n Even when he saw disciples of Phoenix Hall and greeted them, none of them had heard of him.\n It was impossible for him to reconcile with this! He procured such a great achievement, so where was the honor and glory he deserved?\n As he thought this over, Zhou Fei could only come up with a single explanation. The disciple of Phoenix Hall always kept a mentality of being high above others from the start and simply looked down at everyone from the Firebird Hall, Golden Crow Hall, and Vermillion Bird Hall. They must think that all other disciples were nothing but grasshoppers and ants, and even someone who obtained first place would just be a slightly larger ant.\n This sort of contempt caused a fire to rage in Zhou Fei’s heart!\n “Humph, you lot think that us disciples of the three halls are nothing but ants, but what you don’t know is that common mortal talents like me simply don’t have the chance to enter Phoenix Hall if we don’t reach the ninth stage of Life Destruction. But even so, I am far stronger than most of you!”\n Zhou Fei took a deep breath, clenching his fists together. He planned to amaze the world in a single feat during this Ancient Phoenix smelting trial. He believed that with such a result, the high-level figures of Phoenix Cry palace would finally take him seriously and give him the attention he deserved. He would become the focus of all eyes!\n Lin Ming naturally didn’t know he had become the goal that many people were chasing after. As he was eating, the spirit ship underwent the great void shift again and again, shifting dozens of times over.\n Finally, the spirit ship came to a stop in front of a flaming red star. From afar, this fire star seemed extremely serene. It was only that the surface of this star was covered with red spots, as if it were the texture of wood. Surrounding this planet was also a massive ring. This ring stretched out for millions of miles, passing through the skies like a beautiful and endless rainbow.\n This was the location of the Ancient Phoenix smelting trial–Fire Spirit Star.\n This star was only several hundred thousand miles in diameter–it was far smaller than the planet the Sky Spill Continent was on. As the spirit ship entered the atmosphere of Fire Spirit Star, it began to collide with the atmosphere and the fierce friction resulted in endless flames.\n Within the atmosphere of Fire Spirit Star, there were terrifying vortexes of fire origin energy everywhere. Strong winds of fire origin energy traveled at thousands of miles per second, ten times the speed of sound. It was more accurate to say that instead of winds, these were actually shock waves. If a mortal were to be hit by such a breeze, they’d be smashed to death.\n Even a martial artist couldn’t withstand such an impact. This was because what these shock waves blew was not air but extremely wild fire origin energy. Although Fire Spirit Star looked tranquil from the outside, if one looked carefully, they could discover just how terrifying it truly was. Those beautiful red spots one could see from afar were actually formed by the strong winds.\n In such a dangerous and brutal environment, it was impossible for any kind of life to form. This was why Fire Spirit Star was classified as a desolate star. Even so, to a high level martial artist, it was actually an excellent smelting trial location.\n This Fire Spirit Star was considered the territory of the Ancient Phoenix Clan. The Ancient Phoenix Clan had built many smelting trial locations within it.\n “We’ve arrived. Everyone, disembark the spirit ship!”\n Elder Sun yelled out as the leader of the troop.\n “Hehe, let’s go Junior-apprentice Brother Lin. Fire Spirit Star isn’t a place to have fun. You should be careful…” Protector Liu who was responsible for the rookie disciple grinned as he spoke. But just as his voice faded, there were two miserable screams that echoed out. Two rookie disciples of Firebird Hall had their protective true essence blown apart by the strong heavenly winds. They were sent flying backwards by the impact force. Savage and wild fire origin energy broke into their meridians, causing them to vomit a mouthful of blood!\n Several Protectors immediately flew out to catch them. One Protector expanded his protective true essence to cover them and another Protector injected true essence into their bodies. Only then were the two disciples able to catch their breath.\n Elder Sun’s eyes turned chilling. He coldly said, :”What a bunch of pathetic fools. Although I didn’t warn you about the dangers of Fire Spirit Star, you should have sensed just how harsh the environment here was while on the spirit ship. Even so, you casually walked out. I really don’t know how such idiots managed to pass the qualification test. If people like you two entered into a mystic realm to hunt for treasures with others, the best you’ll ever accomplish is being cannon fodder for others, let alone obtaining benefits or lucky chances. Once you leave Firebird Hall, you will likely perish on your road of martial arts. Forget trying to cultivate to higher boundaries. You are both utter disappointments!”\n Elder Sun intentionally didn’t warn the junior disciples about the dangers of Fire Spirit Star because he wanted to test their powers of observation. The result was that they really were idiots.\n The two disciples had already suffered enough misery. After being publicly reprimanded by Elder Sun, their complexions turned white.\n “These two idiots really disgrace Firebird Hall. I can’t believe that I’m stuck in the same hall with them.” Zhou Fei frowned. He was ashamed in his heart that he was in the same group as these people.\n “Haha, they truly are disgraces. But for the lower cultivation disciples, even if they know about the strong heavenly winds of Fire Spirit Star beforehand, it’s still difficult to withstand even if they put forth their full strength. This is why Phoenix Cry Palace has such a rigorous qualification competition that removes over 99% of the disciples. Just watch, many disciples won’t even be able to stand above Fire Spirit Star.” The blue-clothed man that accompanied Zhou Fei casually said.\n \n \n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/martial-world/mw-chapter-989","bookId":1508,"book":{"id":1508,"title":"Martial World","description":"In the Divine Realm, countless legends fought over a mysterious cube.
