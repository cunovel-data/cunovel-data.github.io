Besides the essence gathering system, humans also had high achievements in the body transformation system.\\n\\n The body transformation system. That was – the first six levels of body transformation, followed by the Eight Inner Hidden Gates and then the Nine Stars of the Dao Palace!\\n\\n Many human martial artists chose to walk the road of body transformation. Some human martial artists even chose to dual cultivate body and energy.\\n\\n In this era, numerous human elites rose up.\\n\\n But afterwards, in the great calamity 3.6 billion years ago, the rules of the heavens and earth changed and humanity’s road of body transformation instead became a curse upon them.\\n\\n It became rare for people to break into the Eight Inner Hidden Gates. As for breaking into the Nine Stars of the Dao Palace, that was nigh impossible.\\n\\n This was why humanity from then on had referred to those who chose to take the route of body transformation as… defying the heavens!\\n\\n Even in the 3.6 billion years that followed, a mere two humans had ever managed to break into the Nine Stars of the Dao Palace.\\n\\n One of them was Empyrean Primordius, who relied on the flesh and blood-refining Grandmist Spirit Bead to break through.\\n\\n The other person was Lin Ming. Although he didn’t possess the Grandmist Spirit Bead, he had inherited Empyrean Primordius’ legacy and wishes. Moreover, there was Xiao Moxian who had given him her primal yin energy and pure phoenix blood, causing Lin Ming’s inner yin and yang to become harmonized. With that, Lin Ming had finally been able to break past the chains of the Heavenly Dao.\\n\\n And if there was a reason for all these hurdles, it was because the rules of the Heavenly Dao had changed 3.6 billion years ago!\\n\\n In the past when the saints invaded humanity, many Empyreans and True Divinities had poured their strength into Famine and had it swallow one of humanity’s Heavenly Daos, forcefully severing the connection between humanity and the 33 Heavenly Daos’ Nine Stars of the Dao Palace.\\n\\n To change the Heavenly Dao and the destiny of an entire race, that was a dreadful might which neared the level of a Beyond Divinity existence.\\n\\n And ever since that great war, the human race which had lost the ability to cultivate the Nine Stars of the Dao Palace was like a person who had an arm chopped off.\\n\\n Following that, inheritances that involved the Nine Stars of the Dao Palace were also slowly lost to time.\\n\\n Moreover, in that great war, Empyrean Divine Seal and numerous other human Empyreans had sacrificed themselves, causing innumerable inheritances to be destroyed and many Holy Lands to be annihilated.\\n\\n The result was that the human race began to decline ever since. As for the saints and spiritas, one race possessed the Primeval Realm Ruins and the other possessed the Akashic Dream Universe. These two races became stronger and stronger.\\n\\n In terms of population, humanity could still be considered one of the three peak races. But in terms of strength, the human race was far inferior to the saints and the spiritas.\\n\\n “If Famine managed to swallow one of the humans’ Heavenly Daos, how come my saint race wasn’t able to thoroughly conquer humanity in the great calamity 3.6 billion years ago?”\\n\\n The abyssal demon Famine had already begun racing deep into the universe.\\n\\n Its speed was unbelievable, swiftly passing through the endless void. The Good Fortune Saint Son stood atop Famine’s planet-sized body, asking a question to the Good Fortune Saint Sovereign.\\n\\n “In the war 3.6 billion years ago, the only universe that the humans managed to defend was the Divine Realm. In the Divine Realm, my saint race suffered defeat after defeat. If there was a reason for this, then it would have been the leader of humanity at the time, Divine Seal. I have no idea what lucky chance he found, but his strength was even able to suppress the ancient Saint Sovereign! Amongst True Divinities he was almost unrivalled!\\n\\n “He led the True Divinities of humanity to violently clash with the True Divinities of the saints, even suppressing us… but afterwards, the ancient Saint Sovereign used Famine to devour humanity’s Heavenly Dao of the Nine Stars of the Dao Palace, drastically weakening them. However, Empyrean Divine Seal was able to meld his Divine Seal Art with the Ancient Elysium Seal in a massive array formation. He took advantage of the fact that Famine had used up the majority of its energy to swallow the Heavenly Dao in order to directly seal away Famine’s soul. This is the reason why Famine fell into a deep slumber ever since that war and had become impossible to awaken!\\n\\n “Over so many hundreds of millions of years, many peerless Saint Sovereigns appeared amongst the saints, but none of them were able to awaken Famine. Famine, which had lost its soul, then turned into a massive sea of blood called Famine Sea. Many saint Empyreans didn’t know what the use of this wild sea was, but the truth was that it was Famine’s true body.\\n\\n “Originally, I also didn’t have the ability to awaken Famine. But that changed… when I obtained the Grandmist Spirit Bead.\\n\\n “Using the Grandmist Spirit Bead, I swallowed in a large portion of Famine’s flesh and blood essence and fused it into my body. Like this, I connected to the bloodline of Famine and was able to have my spirit mark be remembered in the depths of his soul.\\n\\n “Now, Famine has already become controlled by my spirit mark. It is almost… my avatar!”\\n\\n Speaking to here, the Good Fortune Saint Sovereign’s voice filled with terror!\\n\\n His face, neck, chest, all were covered with bulging blood vessels. The blood vessels pulsated, making him look like a demon!\\n\\n The Good Fortune Saint Sovereign clenched his fist together, as if the entire universe would be held in his hand!\\n\\n “With Famine as my avatar, in the vast space of the 33 Heavens no one can stop me!”\\n\\n The Good Fortune Saint Sovereign’s voice echoed through the cosmos. With his energy as a medium, it spread for millions of miles, causing planets to shake!\\n\\n Characters on the level of the Good Fortune Saint Sovereign each had their own deep ambitions. In this great calamity when the God Lamenting Wall vanished all over, a majority of the 33 Heavens’ universes had nearly merged into one whole. Infinite mystic realms opened, allowing nearly endless resources to be plundered from them. Everything that could not be obtained before was now obtainable. This was the turning point for everyone to realize their ambitions!\\n\\n …………\\n\\n At this time, innumerable trillions of miles away, the Ark of Hope had already begun a life or death battle with the main forces of the saints!\\n\\n Saint Empyreans appeared one after another, all of them trying to stop the Ark of Hope.\\n\\n The Ark of Hope was a supreme treasure, a Beyond Divinity level spirit ship. However, those driving it were only god race Empyreans. In the hands of Empyreans, the Ark of Hope could only display a miniscule amount of its true strength.\\n\\n Bang!\\n\\n With a loud explosion the Ark of Hope broke into an array formation created by several peak saint Empyreans working together; it’s speed instantly plummeted 30%.\\n\\n Ca!\\n\\n Energy fiercely collided. Divine light brilliantly burnt around the Ark of Hope, making it seem as if they had plunged into a sun.\\n\\n “Everyone attack together, stop that ship!”\\n\\n On the saint race’s side, a peak Empyrean sent out a sound transmission. They had paid such a great price to encircle the ancient remnant races, how could they possibly allow them to escape in the final moment?\\n\\n Three peak Empyreans as well as 15 middle and upper Empyreans behind them gathered together, forming a battle array!\\n\\n With over 18 Empyreans and each one an outstanding existence amongst Empyreans, the might of the battle array they formed could be imagined! In the blink of an eye they could even turn a planet that was hundreds of thousands of miles wide into dust!\\n\\n Looking at the powerful foes looming before them as well as the terrifying array formation, the old God Sovereign’s complexion was cold.\\n\\n “Prepare… the Asura Primal God Cannon!”\\n\\n The Ark of Hope was not some simple transportation spirit ship. Massive array formations were carved into its hull and it came with a dreadful weapon. That was… the Asura Primal God Cannon!\\n\\n Just the Asura Primal God Cannon itself was also another Beyond Divinity level supreme treasure!\\n\\n When all the great array formations on the Ark of Hope were activated, the energy of the Asura Primal God Cannon would accumulate to its limits. Once the Asura Primal God Cannon emitted a shot, it could easily destroy a star. The subsequent explosion that followed would spread for trillions of quadrillions of miles, eventually destroying the entire galaxy.\\n\\n Unfortunately, the god race Empyreans were unable to display the true strength of the Asura Primal God Cannon. Otherwise, let alone the battle array of these Empyreans, they would even be able to trample over the Good Fortune Saint Sovereign.\\n\\n For a time, countless precious energy stones lit up. They were thrown into the Ark of Hope’s array formation without a care of cost, all of them burning together!\\n\\n Within the array formation, a giant ancient black cannon appeared. The barrel of this cannon was carved with countless Asura runes, each one making the mind shake with fear!\\n\\n The Asura Primal God Cannon was a magic tool personally refined by the Asura Road Master in the past. As it appeared, a horrifying pressure exuded outwards, passing through the void and causing all the saint Empyreans to tremble at its killing intent.\\n\\n “What is that?”\\n\\n The saint Empyreans saw the Asura Primal God Cannon on the bow of the Ark of Hope lock onto them. As they were fixated in its sights, they felt as if they were being glared at by the god of death.\\n\\n For a time, the infinite energy of the universe turned into motes of lights that gathered into the Asura Primal God Cannon. Then, the void collapsed. With a deafening roar, the Ancient Primal God Cannon shot out a beam of light that was hundreds of thousands of miles thick, piercing through space!\\n\\n Kacha!\\n\\n With a furious rumble, the void collapsed like thin ice. Looking from far away, all one could see was endless divine light. Even one’s divine sense couldn’t see through this light, as everything was completely twisted up by the terrifying energy storm!\\n\\n “Ahh!”\\n\\n Two saint Empyreans cried out in pain. As their bodies were covered by the light of the Asura Primal God Cannon, they were instantly reduced to ashes!\\n\\n Even the powerful mortal bodies of saint Empyreans couldn’t resist the impact of the Asura Primal God Cannon.\\n\\n A single bombardment had directly killed two saint Empyreans. For a time, the might of the Asura Primal God Cannon frightened and deterred all present!\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/martial-world/mw-chapter-1900","bookId":1508,"book":{"id":1508,"title":"Martial World","description":"In the Divine Realm, countless legends fought over a mysterious cube.
