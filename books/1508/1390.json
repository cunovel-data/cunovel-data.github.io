Because of this link, Lin Ming felt connected with the flesh and blood of the baby dragon and could even feel the tremendous blood vitality slumbering within it.\n In this universe, the more powerful a life form was, the more difficult it was for it to reproduce. Rocs, Dragons, Phoenixes, the three great God Beasts all hatched from eggs, but to do so took a nearly incalculable amount of time and energy.\n However, in the past 100,000 years, the Dragon Sovereign had already completed the majority of the incubation process. The little dragon embryo within the egg had already taken form and now Lin Ming only needed to complete the final step.\n “Lin Ming, before you leave, I will give you one final piece of advice. If things seem impossible, do not push yourself too far. This grand calamity will be even crueler than the one 3.6 billion years ago. This is a war that involves the survival of the human race, and one’s individual strength within this war will seem incomparably small. The greater your ability is, the more responsibility you will have to shoulder. If you haven’t grown by then, do not try to show off. As long as there is life, there will always be hope.”\n Every word that the Dragon Sovereign spoke was well-intentioned advice. Lin Ming felt his heart warm as he heard this. He said, “Senior, please rest assured that this junior will follow your advice.”\n The Dragon Sovereign nodded once more, sighing as he said, “In the past, when Primordius had exhausted the last dregs of his strength and was making his final arrangements, he often spoke about his life. His life was composed of earthshaking events, a man that stood tall and proud in the world and who left behind an indelible legend, but even so, he had made two fatal mistakes in his life. One was that he was far too arrogant in the past. If he had shared the secret of the Grandmist Spirit Bead and allowed the other Empyreans to join forces to assist him then he wouldn’t have been caught off guard by the saint race.”\n “Secret?” Lin Ming was startled. “Are you saying that it wasn’t well known that Empyrean Primordius possessed the Grandmist Spirit Bead? It was a secret?”\n By all reasoning, it was normal that no one would know about the fact that Empyrean Primordius possessed the Grandmist Spirit Bead. If Lin Ming were in Empyrean Primordius’ shoes and had obtained such a treasure, he too wouldn’t have publicized it. That would be suicidal behavior.\n But, the problem was, if Empyrean Primordius had kept everything a secret, how would the saint race know?\n The Dragon Sovereign noticed Lin Ming’s puzzlement, “The saint race has already arranged many spies and chess pieces in the Divine Realm; their invasion preparations began an extremely long time ago and they have many channels from which to obtain news.”\n As the Dragon Sovereign spoke, Lin Ming was still confused, “How high of a cultivation could chess pieces of the saint race have? At most, they would be World King level powerhouses, and moreover they would have to damage their own cultivation in order to cross the God Lamenting Wall and enter the Divine Realm. After arriving here they would have to search everywhere for medicines to restore their strength so how could they possibly have learnt the ultimate secret of an extreme Empyrean?”\n Lin Ming didn’t believe that the saint race spies had the ability to come into contact with Empyrean Primordius.\n The Dragon Sovereign said, “What you said is reasonable and in fact, the saints didn’t possess the methods that you said. However, their chess pieces were not restricted to only saints, but there were also many humans. They carefully chose humans with great ambition and talent to train, taking them under their wing so that they could come into contact with the deepest secrets of humanity…”\n As the Dragon Sovereign spoke, Lin Ming’s mind shook. Tian Mingzi was also in this sort of situation!\n Tian Mingzi’s ambitions were higher than the heavens and he was also superbly gifted. Because of this, the saint race had chosen him. Starting 50,000 years ago, spies of the saint race had come into contact with him, offering him all sorts of resources and help in order to raise him into an Empyrean!\n With the saint race’s background, they indeed had this ability. Moreover, Tian Mingzi himself wasn’t poor material to begin with; his only limit was a poor background. But, the appearance of the saint race had made up for his shortcomings.\n They used all sorts of spells and restriction methods, making oaths and contracts at the level of a transcendent divine might in order to shackle Tian Mingzi and then raise him into an Empyrean chess piece. An Empyrean chess piece was more useful than 10,000 saint spies!\n “The saint race has really laid out a great plan!”\n Lin Ming grimaced, his thoughts turning dark. To raise an Empyrean would cost a countless amount of time and resources; they had indeed put forth enough capital.\n If it weren’t for Tian Mingzi’s plans being toppled by Lin Ming, it was likely he would have become a human Empyrean that betrayed his own race in the future. For eternal life, for dominating strength, there would always be people that couldn’t resist these temptations. They would make a deal with the devil, even selling their soul.\n “So the traitor in the past was Empyrean Thunder Punishment?” Lin Ming suddenly asked.\n The Dragon Sovereign’s face flashed with a color of venom and loathing. He replied, “You’re quite smart. Yes, the one to betray Primordius was none other than Empyrean Thunder Punishment. When Primordius spoke of his two greatest mistakes, the first one I have already said. As for the second, that is that his natural character was far too honest and straightforward, prone to follow his emotions. He swore brotherhood with Thunder Punishment but didn’t see his true character. As for Thunder Punishment, when he swore brotherhood with Primordius he had long since become the dog of the saints. Without the saint race supporting him he would never have arrived at the step he did.”\n With this, Lin Ming understood everything.\n He finally knew why in the war 100,000 years ago, Empyrean Primordius had to resist the onslaught of several Empyrean masters without any allies to call on.\n He also knew why the supreme elders of the Divine Realm mostly didn’t know the circumstances of this matter. Until now, only Empyrean Divine Dream and a select several other people knew the truth. People like Great World Kings of first-order worlds would have no idea about these events. Of course, even if they knew, they could only stare greedily on at Empyrean Primordius’ inheritance without any ability to obtain it.\n In fact, in Lin Ming’s eyes, Primordius’ first mistake wasn’t a mistake at all. It wasn’t that Empyrean Primordius was too arrogant, because no matter who it was, it was impossible to share such a great secret like the existence of the Grandmist Spirit Bead. If he shared it, the situation might even have worsened. After all, it was hard to predict the hearts and minds of others.\n Empyrean Primordius’ true mistake was his second one. Because he didn’t conceal the existence of the Grandmist Spirit Bead to the limit and had wrongly believed in Empyrean Thunder Punishment, he had now ended up in such a state.\n Human nature was truly impossible to predict…\n Because of that, the strange curse of the Eternal Demon Abyss, the Skysplit Towers, the Road of Emperor, the Black Dragon, the tomb of the goddess, the Forsaken God Clan, the enigma of the battle between Empyrean Primordius and Empyrean Thunder Punishment, and just why Empyrean Primordius would appear at a lower realms world like the Sky Spill Planet…\n Lin Ming finally understood all of this. Now, the only thing he didn’t know was whether Empyrean Primordius was dead or alive and whether those skeletal remains in the Primordius Heavenly Palace were those of Empyrean Primordius.\n That was also the final riddle of the Eternal Demon Abyss.\n As for this riddle, not even the Dragon Sovereign knew the truth.\n The journey into the Eternal Demon Abyss had finally ended. Lin Ming had inherited the full legacy of Empyrean Primordius and had even obtained the most precious treasure, the Primordius Heavenly Palace from it. Not just that, but there was also the 100 million years of condensed essence energy from the true Grandmist Spirit Bead.\n And lastly, there was the supremely precious baby dragon.\n The only regret was that the true Grandmist Spirit Bead had been stolen away by the saint race.\n This was also inevitable. If the saint race didn’t succeed in obtaining the Grandmist Spirit Bead the first time, the True Divinity powerhouses of the saints would inevitably have consumed their own blood essence and life force to rip apart the God Lamenting wall once more to obtain it. Lin Ming didn’t believe that the enchantment Empyrean Primordius had set over the Sky Spill Planet would be able to block the invasion of several saint Empyreans.\n It was finally time to leave.\n All that Lin Ming had left to do in the lower realms was to return a mortal body to Demonshine and visit his little sister, Lin Xiaoge, as well as his parents. Then, he would return to the Divine Realm.\n \n \n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/martial-world/mw-chapter-1385","bookId":1508,"book":{"id":1508,"title":"Martial World","description":"In the Divine Realm, countless legends fought over a mysterious cube.
