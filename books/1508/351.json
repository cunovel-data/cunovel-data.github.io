For a full hour, his mother had discussed marriage with him. As he remembered the hidden bitterness in her eyes, even he felt a headache coming on. Lin Ming subconsciously tried to avoid love and marriage. This wasn’t because he had failed ins this field or before. Although Lin Ming was very sad when Lan Yunyue betrayed him, this sadness was more because of himself. He hated that he didn’t fight back, and he hated that he didn’t have the power to. Now, these matters had been cleared long ago; it hadn’t even left much of a mark on Lin Ming’s mind. Lin Ming would be lying to himself if he said that he didn’t have feelings towards Qin Xingxuan, because he did. However, he could not marry her, because he could not afford to shoulder this responsibility. He was destined to leave Sky Fortune Kingdom, leave the Divine Phoenix Province, leave the South Horizon Region, and break through the martial void. This path was extremely dangerous. A single accident, a single misstep, and he would be doomed. It was impossible to bring Qin Xingxuan along this road, because she would die. But if he didn’t bring Qin Xingxuan with him, and asked that she stay home with his mother, that would also be impossible, because it was just too unfair for her. The only one with the ability to walk with him might be Mu Qianyu. If she was willing… Huu! A flame lit in Lin Ming’s room. This was a top sect’s specific sound transmitting talisman. Mu Qianyu’s voice sounded in Lin Ming’s ear, speaking two messages. First, Divine Phoenix Island would soon wage war with the South Sea Demon Region. Second, he needed to return to Divine Phoenix Island within three months and enter the Divine Phoenix Mystic Realm. “Divine Phoenix Mystic Realm…” Lin Ming paused, he didn’t expect it to be so soon. When Lin Ming was listed as the only heaven-step talent on the joint talent training program, he was able to enjoy treatment equal to a core disciple of Divine Phoenix Island, and he was also given an opportunity to enter the Divine Phoenix Mystic Realm. Lin Ming had asked Mu Qianyu just what the Divine Phoenix Mystic Realm was. It wasn’t a testing zone that was set up by Divine Phoenix Island, but rather a wondrous place that was left behind by the ancient Phoenix Clan. When one entered the Divine Phoenix Mystic Realm, there was a chance of dying. The chances weren’t high – it was only around 10%. But what was terrifying was that who lived and who died didn’t depend on strength, but seemed to be a matter of luck. There were no laws stating who would die or why. The strong could die, while the weak could live. Of those that came out, some obtained advantages, some obtained increases in strength and cultivation, some obtained valuable materials, some obtained high-grade treasures, and there were even some that obtained the precious bloodline of Saint Beasts. “Three months… I’ll have to see what the Divine Phoenix Mystic Realm is like…” Lin Ming sat on a cushion and continued to practice the ‘Vermillion Bird Forbidden Divine Chronicle’, slowly consolidating his cultivation and refining out the pill toxins. Lin Ming’s essence gathering cultivation system now relied on the ‘Vermillion Bird Forbidden Divine Chronicle’. The ‘Chaotic Virtues Combat Meridians’ was only a Body Transformation cultivation method manual, and was no longer suited for him to practice at the Pulse Condensation period to reach a higher realm. Like this, another two days passed. Every day, Lin Ming would leave his quiet room and pass time with his family and friends. This day, Lin Ming had just finished eating with his parents, and was playing chess with Lin Xiaodong, when he suddenly heard someone say, ”Lin Ming.” When he looked back, he saw a splendidly dressed Qin Xingxuan. She was holding a tray of tea in her hands, and was standing against the brilliant sunset, beautifully smiling. As Lin Xiaodong saw Qin Xingxuan, his plump face wrinkled in a cheap, sly grin, and he deliberately shouted out with great exaggeration, “Oh! I just remembered that I have something very important to do! I’ll be going first!” As he said this, he speedily scurried away, leaving behind only an awkwardly smiling Qin Xingxuan. She slowly arranged the tea set on the stone table. It was a lazy day. The sunlight of the bright spring afternoon shined down, glimmering. To sit in a garden pavilion with tea, having some refreshments, with a beauty pouring the tea and being able to view the flowers, this was a fairy-like life. However, Lin Ming actually wasn’t able to enjoy any of this at the time. Instead, he was somewhat afraid… Qin Xingxuan unhurriedly rinsed the teacups, steeping the tea. A light fragrance wafted out, refreshing the heart. “Brother Lin, these past few days have been really distressing for you, right?” Qin Xingxuan whispered as she gently placed a teacup in front of Lin Ming. Lin Ming paused. Qin Xingxuan had always called him by his full name. She had never been someone who referred to him with such a distant and respectful title like ‘Brother Lin’. Lin Ming didn’t know why, but he felt a slight twisting pain in his heart. With the fragrance of the tea filling the air, the two people fell into a silent lull. Slowly, as the teal cooled down, Qin Xingxuan quietly said, “Tomorrow I will be going back to the capital.” “Mm.” Lin Ming replied, an unhappy feeling in his heart. Seeing Lin Ming’s expression, Qin Xingxuan suddenly smiled. The radiant sunlight sprinkled on her light yellow dress; it was utterly compelling to the human eye. She said, “Brother Lin, these days I’ve been thinking about many things. And, it seems that there are some matters that are destined to not be right. For instance, several hundred years from now, when I become an old lady, even I won’t be able to tolerate it…” Qin Xingxuan’s voice seemed to have a jokingly playful tone that was masking the bitterness in her heart, causing Lin Ming to be very uncomfortable. Several hundred years from now, Lin Ming’s looks wouldn’t have changed too much. As for Qin Xingxuan, it would be extremely difficult for her to break through to the Revolving Core realm. Several hundred years from now, she might already be reaching the end point of her life. Just this point caused these two individuals to live in separate worlds, unable to be together. This was the matter that Qin Xingxuan mentioned she wouldn’t be able to tolerate; she absolutely did not want such a scene. An afternoon tea was drank for less than half an hour. The tea still had a fragrant smell, but it seemed to have a bitter taste to it that pained the heart. Even after Qin Xingxuan left, Lin Ming was still in a daze. Thinking of her beautiful face gradually waning under the knife of time, Lin Ming felt his heart pained with regret. Only if… Suddenly, Lin Ming’s mind shook. Qin Xingxuan wasn’t even 16 years old yet, and her cultivation was at the mere Bone Forging stage. If she tossed aside all of her current cultivation and retrained from scratch, then… Lin Ming had already completed the preliminary true essence physical transformations stage of the ‘Chaotic Virtues Combat Meridians’. As for the ‘True Primal Chaos Formula’, Lin Ming had reached Large Success of the third layer. That was the main true essence revolution method of the ‘Chaotic Virtues Combat Meridians’. With this foundation, he might try to engrave this knowledge of the ‘True Primal Chaos Formula’ onto a jade slip. If he could leave some cultivation methods and inheritances of the Realm of the Gods to his own wife and future children so that they could become stronger, only in that way would Lin Ming have true peace of mind. With Qin Xingxuan’s sixth-grade talent, if she learned some of the legacies of the realm of the Gods, and also had a few lucky chances, then reaching the Revolving Core realm should be nothing at all. In the future, Qin Xingxuan might even be of great assistance to him. With his mind set, Lin Ming entered the quiet room, took out a blank jade slip, and began to engrave the ‘True Primal Chaos Formula’. Engraving a cultivation method manual was an arduous and exceedingly complicated process, and the person engraving and to be very proficient in this cultivation method. This was also the reason that cultivation method jade slips were so incomparably precious. Lin Ming spent a full afternoon and night to finally engrave the first half of the ‘True Primal Chaos Formula’ Of course, there were many flaws and some omissions, but this was the best that Lin Ming could do, unless he could cultivate the ‘True Primal Chaos Formula’ to Perfection. If Qin Xingxuan practiced this cultivation method, she would have to take many detours and it would be much more difficult than when Lin Ming had practiced it. But, it was far superior to practicing the third-rate cultivation methods of the Seven Profound Valleys. At midnight, the oil lamp in Qin Xingxuan’s room was still shining brightly. She was cultivating on her bed, but her heart wasn’t calm. She envied Mu Qianyu to the bone; if only she had her talent and strength… Qin Xingxuan was not afraid of aging, nor did she wish for immortality. What she feared was that when her husband still seemed to be a strapping, handsome young man, she would be a white-haired granny. To her, this was an incomparably scary and horrifying future. Even if her husband could accept this, she could not. The door sounded, it was Lin Ming. Qin Xingxuan was stunned. It wasn’t polite to enter a woman’s room late at night, especially if it was seen by others. This must be an extraordinary matter. Qin Xingxuan carefully welcomed Lin Ming into her room, puzzled. She asked, “Brother Lin, is there an urgent matter?” “For you.” Lin Ming didn’t speak any idle chatter. He took out a jade slip and placed it on the table. Qin Xingxuan picked up the jade slip, it was still warm to the touch. This jade slip was obviously newly engraved, otherwise it would have already been polished smooth by the touch of hands. As she slipped her sense into the jade slip, Qin Xingxuan was stunned. She continued to look carefully. After a quarter of an hour, Qin Xingxuan withdrew her sense, shocked, and glanced at Lin Ming with incredulity in her eyes. Although Lin Ming hadn’t engraved the entire ‘True Primal Chaos Formula’, with Qin Xingxuan’s intelligence and talent, she already realized how precious this cultivation method was. It was absolutely more precious and rare than any core cultivation method of the Seven Profound Valleys. “This… this cultivation method is…” Qin Xingxuan’s voice trembled as she spoke. Maybe this incomparably precious cultivation method was obtained by Lin Ming when he risked his life in some ancient ruins somewhere. How could he so easily give this away? Now, giving this to her was a commitment, a promise and a pledge. It was much more reliable than sweet whispered nothings and words of love. There was no need to say anything anymore. For a time, many chaotic thoughts surged into Qin Xingxuan’s mind. It was so sudden that she wanted to cry. Lin Ming said, “This cultivation method is only a part. I don’t have the original jade slip, I can only practice. This matter is very difficult to explain. I just want to say that this cultivation method is extremely important, and it is imperative that it remain confidential. Otherwise, it will provoke a calamity. Afterwards, when I have the ability to engrave the rest, I’ll do so and give it to you. Everything’s for you.” Qin Xingxuan held the jade slip close to her bosom, her lips pursed as she gazed at Lin Ming. Lin Ming’s eyes were soft and gentle, broad and warm. Looking at him, she couldn’t help but close her eyes, her eyelashes trembling. After Qin Xingxuan calmed herself down, she opened her eyes and said, “I won’t tell this to anyone.” “Give up the cultivation method you were practicing, and take this ‘True Primal Chaos Formula’ as the foundation, retraining yourself through Strength Training, Flesh Training, Viscera Training, Altering Muscle, and Bone Forging. Remove all the impurities of your body and refine the tempered true essence from your body. This is the only way you can reset your foundation.” Lin Ming didn’t plan on having Qin Xingxuan learn Tempering Marrow. The conditions for Tempering Marrow were simply too difficult, thus the reason why he would teach Qin Xingxuan the foundation ‘True Primal Chaos Formula’. As long as Qin Xingxuan built up the foundation and continued to practice an essence gathering system, everything would be possible. Later, when Qin Xingxuan swallowed pills, he could also use his Flame Essence to help her rid her body of impurities. With this matter complete, Lin Ming was extremely happy. In that moment, it was as if a great amount of pill toxins in his body had disappeared. With no more worries, Lin Ming would go to Dark Moon Island, and take the hidden treasures of the Moon Seizing Sect.
