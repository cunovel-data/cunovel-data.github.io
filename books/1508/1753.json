Space split open and a space storm rushed out from the crack, followed by two women and one man.\\n\\n These three people were Lin Ming, Xiao Moxian, and Mo Brightmoon.\\n\\n After all these years, Lin Ming had finally returned to the Divine Realm – this was the homeland of humanity.\\n\\n Feeling the extremely familiar world Laws around him, Lin Ming took a deep breath, filled with emotion. It felt as if everything he had known was a lifetime ago.\\n\\n But compared to Lin Ming, Xiao Moxian was actually ecstatic. Facing the endless void, her childlike playfulness came back in full force. She placed her hands near her mouth and shouted out as loud as she could in the void, “I’ve returned! I, Ji Xian’er, have finally returned!”\\n\\n Empty space originally had no medium to carry sound waves, but, Xiao Moxian was able to use the power of Space Laws and move space, using space fluctuations as the medium for communication and allowing her voice to travel out for thousands and thousands of miles.\\n\\n Lin Ming and Xiao Moxian had been away from the Divine Realm for around 80 years. During this time, around 20 years was spent in Tragic Death Valley. Thus, in the Divine Realm, the truth was that around 60 years had passed.\\n\\n In one parting, so many years had passed. The time that Lin Ming and Xiao Moxian spent in the Asura Road was twice the time they had spent in the Divine Realm. It was no surprise that their reflection upon returning was so intense.\\n\\n However, compared to Xiao Moxian and Lin Ming, there was someone who had an even more intense reaction.\\n\\n That was Mo Brightmoon.\\n\\n She stood in the void of the Divine Realm, familiar with the aura of Laws from her homeland. Without sensing it, hot tears filled her eyes.\\n\\n How many years had it been? Even she couldn’t remember.\\n\\n But today, she had finally returned to the Divine Realm.\\n\\n She recalled when she had been hunted down by Tian Mingzi. She remembered the scene of when her older sister had sacrificed herself to activate the Magic Cube. In that moment, her heart ached. In these years, although Mo Brightmoon had searched for her big sister, she never dared to imagine there would come a day when they could meet again.\\n\\n “Lin Ming… you said that my big sister is in Divine Dream Heavenly Palace?”\\n\\n Empyrean Divine Dream had been famous for a long time and Mo Brightmoon naturally knew her great name. Mentioning such a place, Mo Brightmoon was awed.\\n\\n “Yes. We should go to a nearby planet to purchase a star chart. With Primordius Heavenly Palace’s speed, it shouldn’t take over a month to reach Divine Dream Heavenly Palace.”\\n\\n Hearing Lin Ming speak about returning to Divine Dream Heavenly Palace, Xiao Moxian seemed to remember something and she felt as if she lost something important in her heart. Her joy upon returning to the Divine Realm rapidly faded away, leaving her sad and upset.\\n\\n Facing the endless starry skies, Xiao Moxian’s eyes blurred as she lost herself in her thoughts.\\n\\n “Miss Xian’er, are you okay?”\\n\\n Mo Brightmoon asked with concern, noticing the change in Xiao Moxian.\\n\\n “I’m fine.”\\n\\n Xiao Moxian casually responded, unable to summon any energy.\\n\\n Looking at Xiao Moxian’s despondent appearance, Lin Ming fell silent, not saying a single word.\\n\\n He naturally knew what Xiao Moxian was thinking.\\n\\n In the past, he and Xiao Moxian were in Bai Qi’s grave where they were forced into a dead end by Tian Mingzi. Lin Ming exhausted every method he had and finally won the chance to catch his breath, momentarily escaping into Primordius Heavenly Palace.\\n\\n There, within Primordius Heavenly Palace, he had bet everything on a single throw of the dice and attempted to break into the Nine Stars of the Dao Palace. But in the critical moment he had been foiled by Tian Mingzi and nearly failed!\\n\\n Following this, Xiao Moxian ignored all repercussions and recklessly gave her primordial yin to Lin Ming, allowing yin and yang to fuse together. With this, Lin Ming was able to equalize the tyrannical energy from the Grandmist Spirit Bead essence in his body, and then crush the heaven and earth dao diagram, rushing all the way into the Nine Stars of the Dao Palace.\\n\\n At the time, when Xiao Moxian made this decision, she had undergone countless struggles.\\n\\n After all, the demon race and monster race were more inclined towards joining forces with the saints than they were joining forces with humanity. In their estimation, in anyone’s estimation, they felt that in this great world calamity it was far more likely the saints would emerge victorious.\\n\\n Even the Empyreans of humanity couldn’t help but acknowledge this.\\n\\n If the demon and monster races joined together with the saints, they would inevitably be ranked under them in the future. But, this fate was better than being completely annihilated by the saints.\\n\\n Xiao Moxian was a proud daughter of heaven who originated from both the monster race and demon race. It was likely that she would be married off to the Good Fortune Saint Son in the future. If it was known that she was with Lin Ming, it could be called a betrayal of her people.\\n\\n However, during her days in the Asura Road, Xiao Moxian continued following Lin Ming. As if she were living a wonderful dream, she didn’t allow any of those troublesome matters to cloud her mind. Or, perhaps it had been a way for her to escape the chains of her fate.\\n\\n But now she had awakened from her dream and had no choice but to face the brutal reality laid out before her.\\n\\n Lin Ming had to return to Divine Dream Heavenly Palace. As for Xiao Moxian, she had to return to Demondawn Heavenly Palace.\\n\\n From this place, they would separate. As for what would happen in the future, Xiao Moxian couldn’t imagine it.\\n\\n For a time, Lin Ming and Xiao Moxian were both silent.\\n\\n Lin Ming looked at Xiao Moxian, his eyes recording every curve of her beautiful face. Time seemed to blur as his thoughts returned to Bai Qi’s Tomb. Those words that Xiao Moxian said to him reverberated in his ears…\\n\\n …If you were to die with me here, would you regret it?...\\n\\n …But Lin Ming, I don’t want you to die. I will give you my everything… and when you break through the Nine Stars of the Dao Palace and escape from here, you will live on for a billion years, a trillion years, and my blood will always follow you…\\n\\n Remembering all of this, Lin Ming was filled with emotions. He hesitated for a moment and then opened his mouth to ask, “Must you go back?”\\n\\n If Xiao Moxian were to return, then Lin Ming could imagine that she wouldn’t be able to hide what happened between him and her from the demon race and monster race.\\n\\n This was because Xiao Moxian’s bloodline was special. She had given her primordial yin to him, and anyone that was specifically probing for this could find out the truth.\\n\\n The atmosphere of the Divine Realm was originally biased towards being conservative. In the Divine Realm, there was a high importance placed on the chastity of a woman. In addition to the marriage union with the saints, if all of this were to be discovered then she would find it difficult to gain a foothold in the monster race or demon race. She would inevitably face tremendous pressure.\\n\\n Lin Ming didn’t want to see this occur, thus he asked this question. If Xiao Moxian hid herself in the Magic Cube space then no matter how heaven-defying Empyrean Demondawn’s methods were, he would never be able to find her.\\n\\n But, doing so was the same as Xiao Moxian abandoning her people. With her personality she would never agree to such a thing.\\n\\n And indeed, Xiao Moxian shook her head. “Big Brother Lin, we must part here. If possible, I will try to change my grandfather’s mind…”\\n\\n As Xiao Moxian spoke to here, her complexion paled. In truth, saying she would try to change her grandfather’s mind was just random words. How could someone like Xiao Moxian change such an important decision of the demon race and monster race? This was a decision that concerned the survival of their two races.\\n\\n Lin Ming silently nodded, not speaking.\\n\\n “Big Brother Lin… if destiny wills it, our paths will cross again.”\\n\\n As Xiao Moxian spoke, she threw herself into Lin Ming’s chest and deeply kissed him.\\n\\n Then, without pause, her figure flickered and she disappeared from Lin Ming’s chest like a dark fairy.\\n\\n She turned into a black beam of light and submerged into the endless darkness. Her slender figure disappeared into the vast starry skies.\\n\\n Lin Ming looked at the direction Xiao Moxian disappeared in, gazing off into the distance for a long time.\\n\\n Beside Lin Ming, Mo Brightmoon was puzzled. She waited for a long time and finally couldn’t help but ask, “Lin Ming, what is the deal with you and Xiao Moxian?”\\n\\n Lin Ming was silent. After a long period of reflection, he began to speak to Mo Brightmoon about his history with Xiao Moxian, his karmic ties to her, the cause and effects of their relationship.\\n\\n Mo Brightmoon listened with a slight frown. She never imagined that this relationship concerned the life and death of different races. To try and overcome the hostility of two races for marriage, it was unlikely there would be a good ending, especially for Lin Ming and Xiao Moxian who would never abandon their races.\\n\\n Mo Brightmoon said, “Lin Ming… according to what you said, it will be extremely difficult for you to be together with Xiao Moxian. The only exception is if… you are powerful, powerful enough that you can interfere in the high level decisions of the demon and monster races…”\\n\\n Listening to Mo Brightmoon’s words, Lin Ming wryly smiled. “How can I not also understand this truth? But for me to reach that degree of strength, I have no idea how many years or months it will take. At the very least, only when I have the ability to resist a True Divinity will my words have power in this great world calamity and be able to influence the decisions of the monster race and demon race. Before then, anything I say is simply empty talk.”\\n\\n Lin Ming shook his head over and over.\\n\\n What he needed was strength! Strength to struggle with a True Divinity!\\n\\n However, no matter how heaven-defying Lin Ming’s talent was, it was impossible for his strength to reach the True Divinity realm in hundreds or even thousands of years. He needed to experience an extremely long period of accumulation!\\n\\n “Come, let’s return to Divine Dream Heavenly Palace.”\\n\\n “Mm, okay.”\\n\\n Mo Brightmoon nodded. Because of Lin Ming’s matters, her joy of seeing her big sister again was a little diluted. She truly wished from the bottom of her heart that there would be a good ending between Lin Ming and Xiao Moxian.\\n\\n Like this, Lin Ming and Mo Brightmoon used Primordius Heavenly Palace as a spirit ship, rapidly flying through the void.\\n\\n As Lin Ming and Mo Brightmoon were flying towards Divine Dream Heavenly Palace, Xiao Moxian had already returned to Demondawn Heavenly Palace – Demondawn Heavenly Palace was much closer.\\n\\n Just as she reached the periphery of Demondawn Heavenly Palace, before entering, Xiao Moxian discovered a change. And this change caused her to recall something. At once, she felt even more helpless. She darkly sighed…\\n\\n \\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/martial-world/mw-chapter-1745","bookId":1508,"book":{"id":1508,"title":"Martial World","description":"In the Divine Realm, countless legends fought over a mysterious cube.
