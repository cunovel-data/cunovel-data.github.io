{"id":54050,"no":105,"title":"Chapter 104 - Amazing Spear","content":"Chapter 104 – Amazing Spear\n …\n …\n …\n This was the greatest harvest from the days that Lin Ming and Hong Xi sparred against each other. This was to use move after move, and gather one’s momentum, and after accumulating all of the residual momentum, to have that last strike erupt out and sweep all away!\n Lin Ming’s spear seemed much slower than Zhu Yan. When Zhu Yan made three moves, Lin Ming only made one. But what was incredible was that Lin Ming’s one spear was able to block all three of Zhu Yan’s sword moves!\n This made one have very contradictory feelings. Those martial artists whose cultivations were too shallow could not understand the complex mysteries and profound principles in these two young men’s fight. They would only feel like Zhu Yan was making useless moves, and in every three moves he made, there might not even be one that was useful.\n On the reserved seating area, a noble man over 30 years old was watching Zhu Yan and Lin Ming’s fight, and shaking his head. “This Zhu Yan is just too mediocre. His sword moves are just too gaudy. All he has is looks without substance; it’s not very practical. These kinds of sword moves look nice, but have too many flaws to connect. Ah Wei, what do you think?”\n This noble himself was only a second-grade martial arts talent. He was over thirty years old, and was at the early Third Stage of Body Transformation. He had some small insights into martial artist, so he asked his guard this question.\n “My Lord, Zhu Yan’s sword has indeed lost its light and sublime feeling. This subordinate does find it strange. The sword light that Zhu Yan had displayed before was truly swift and fierce. Even if it were this subordinate facing that sword light, I would not have full confidence to grasp it.”\n This guard was also over 30 years old, and he was at the early Fifth Stage of Body Transformation. However when he saw Zhu Yan display his sword skills before, he could not help but acknowledge his skill. If he were against Zhu Yan, his assurance of winning would only be 30 or 40%.\n “You cannot defend against that sword light?” The noble smiled, but thought otherwise in his heart. “Ah Wei, you think too little of yourself. These years in the Seven Profound Martial House, besides Ling Sen, Ta Ku, and a few others, the people there have been getting worse and worse with each generation. In the past, the martial arts of the Seven Profound Martial House were able to fight those a stage above them as if they were having a simple meal. But you just look at this Zhu Yan. If I remember correctly, he is in the top 30 rankings of the Ranking Stone, and the sword in his hand…” The noble was prepared to elaborate on a few more of these martial arts ‘insights’, when the smile on his face suddenly froze.\n On the stage, Lin Ming and Zhu Yan’s fight had already reached the edge of the platform. As Lin Ming thrusted out his spear, Zhu Yan moved sideways to avoid. Because Lin Ming’s spear hit nothing, it continued thrusting until it hit a thick column at the edge of the stage.\n He withdrew his spear, but at the same time, an incredible scene took place!\n After being struck by Lin Ming’s spear, that thick stone column broke apart with an explosion from top to bottom!\n Along with the crashing sounds, numerous stone fragments rolled down like peas, and finally turned to a small pile of rubble. This stone column was completely destroyed!\n It was as if that stone column was held together by tofu!\n “This… what is going on here?” The noble’s eyes were looking straight out. He had clearly seen a moment ago that Lin Ming’s thrust had not hit, and he had only withdrawn his spear.\n But before he had withdrawn his spear, that spear had lightly scratched a spot on the surface, and that had actually caused the 20 feet high stone column to explode into a pile of crushed rocks. And the biggest crushed rock was only the size of a fist!\n It was not only this noble, but everyone present, including Ling Sen, Ta Ku, Muyi, and other masters were all equally shocked. Some people even subconsciously rubbed their eyes, thinking that they had seen an illusion.\n Was that really caused by a spear?\n To crush a stone column was actually very easy. Many of the masters and experts present had this strength, but to have a spear do it to a stone column and have the biggest rubble piece only be the size of a fist, none of those present were able to achieve this!\n Even Muyi could not. Although he could send out countless sword lights in a flash and cut the stone column apart, resulting in almost identical effects, his sword actually could not create such an effect with just a touch.\n Even the normally stable Crown Prince had lost his calm as he saw these scene. “Teacher, this is… what kind of spear skill?”\n The Crown Prince had a certain understanding of martial arts, but he had never seen a martial skill like this before.\n Muyi shook his head. “Your Highness, I am not sure.”\n As the last piece of crushed stone stopped rolling, the entire audience was silent at the Martial Stage. They were shocked and shaken by this scene.\n But the various masters of the Seven Profound Martial House, like Ling Sen, Ta Ku, and several other old deacons, saw this pile of rubble and had faint, blossoming suspicions in their hearts. Although it was reasonable, they did not even dare to believe this suspicious!\n This move, could it be…\n Zhu Yan looked at this pile of rubble closely. His right hand gripped his sword tightly, and because of excessive force, his knuckles began to turn white!\n “’Body Tearing Bone Shattering Fist!’ You’ve cultivated the ‘Body Tearing Bone Shattering Fist’!”\n Zhu Yan had specially gone to the depository before to look at the martial skills that Lin Ming had chosen. Now, he finally understood the reason why Lin Ming was able to contain him. This was because he had managed to cultivate the ‘Body Tearing Bone Shattering Fist’!!!\n That he could keep hold of Zhang Cang’s saber with his empty palm, and use only that fist wind to push back Zhang Cang, was because he had relied on this ‘Body Tearing Bone Shattering Fist’!\n Zhu Yan also suddenly understood that it was the true essence vibration that was described on the jade slip of the ‘Body Tearing Bone Shattering Fist’. This was what had caused his insides to lose their normal rhythm, and cause all of his body’s blood to want to flow in reverse!\n How could this Lin Ming possibly have managed to learn the ‘Body Tearing Bone Shattering Fist’?\n “’Body Tearing Bone Shattering Fist’?”\n Those present were stunned. For most of them, this ‘Body Tearing Bone Shattering Fist’ was just an unknown cultivation method. And listening to such a vulgar name, it couldn’t be any sort of amazing or powerful martial skill.\n However, to the disciples of the Seven Profound Martial House, the name of ‘Body Tearing Bone Shattering Fist’ struck their hearts like a savage earthquake!\n Before Lin Ming had become famous, most people had never heard of this incomplete martial skill. However, after he had defeated Zhang Cang and become the 62nd ranking disciple of the Ten Thousand Killing Array, the cultivation methods and martial skills he had chosen also became famous!\n The pair ‘Foundation Spear Technique’ and ‘Foundation Movement Technique’ cultivation methods that normally no one would as for had suddenly become two of the most wanted manuals overnight. But the ‘Body Tearing Bone Shattering Fist’ had been left behind. It was inevitable that people would see what was wrong with this cultivation method.\n Low-grade Earth-step cultivation method. Loss rate, 70%!\n Seeing these two points, even the fanatical fans of Lin Ming mania would not be so stupid or empty headed to choose this manual.\n The ‘Body Tearing Bone Shattering Fist’ was only deemed as a low-grade Earth-step manual because it was lacking the most important beginning section, so its rank was unable to be judged by the elder who was responsible for ranking these cultivation methods. Nobody actually knew its true ranking.\n It had to be known that the higher a cultivation method was, the more difficult it was to practice! If the ‘Body Tearing Bone Shattering Fist’ was complete, it would be far more difficult to cultivate than Zhu Yan’s ‘Falling Star Slash’ and ‘Limitless Sunset Shine’! Without the heaven defying perception of a monstrous genius, it would be a ridiculous dream for anyone in the Body Transformation Stage to want to practice an Earth-step martial skill!\n Much less, this martial skill was incomplete!\n Not only was it incomplete, but the beginning of it was incomplete! For most martial skills, if the later sections were missing, the beginning portions could still be practiced.\n But if the beginning was incomplete, then a martial skill would have no value at all. Otherwise, how would the Seven Profound Valleys possibly place an Earth-step cultivation method like the ‘Body Tearing Bone Shattering Fist’ in the Seven Profound Martial House’s outer pavilion? That place was simply a garbage disposal for their unwanted jade slips!\n The people who saw Lin Ming choose the ‘Body Tearing Bone Shattering Fist’ had disagreed with him. Even if it was a crazy fan of Lin Ming’s, they had not thought he would perceive anything from meditating on this cultivation method.\n But Lin Ming, even in this situation, had relied on this cultivation at the Third Stage of Body Transformation to learn this ‘Body Tearing Bone Shattering Fist’, that not even the hidden and mysterious Xiantian experts of the Seven Profound Valleys were able to understand!\n Was this really a human?\n Throughout the entire history of the Sky Fortune Kingdom, or even the entire history of the Sky Spill Continent, this Lin Ming had the most terrifying perception to ever exist!\n This fellow, he was simply the reincarnation of a heavenly god or devilish demon!\n No wonder Lin Ming had made such astonishing progress in just a few short months. With this kind of godlike perception, any talent was simply floating clouds, just nothing but trash!\n The Tenth Prince had already been made aware of what sort of manual this ‘Body Tearing Bone Shattering Fist’ was; he did not need his subordinates to explain it to him. The Tenth Prince had enough achievements in the martial arts aspects to know what it meant to be able to cultivate such a skill.\n He looked towards Lin Ming’s form on the stage, and his face began to darken, becoming increasingly somber and terrible.\n He had not thought that he had underestimated Lin Ming! This young man was actually terrifying to such a degree!\n The Tenth Prince’s heart had a faint premonition. If he truly became enemies with Lin Ming, and was unable to annihilate him before he grew, then Lin Ming would become the biggest barrier on his road to snatching the throne!\n As the fight had progressed to this stage, victory or defeat had already become secondary. It was possible that even if Lin Ming lost to Zhu Yan in this battle, his reputation would even be more resounding!\n It would spread throughout the entire capital!\n Facing Lin Ming who was like a reincarnation of some divine being, even though Zhu Yan’s heart of martial arts was strong, he had completely lost the courage to fight. Zhu Yan knew that even if he defeated Lin Ming today, in just a few months, it would be reversed and he would be defeated!\n He had annoyed an enemy which he absolutely should not have stirred up!\n “Kill him!!!!”\n Zhu Yan’s heart suddenly gave birth to this idea!\n Before Lin Ming grew, he had to kill him. This was the only solution!\n However, to assassinate someone in the Seven Profound Martial House was too tough and too difficult. Moreover, once they were discovered, regardless of whom it was, the Seven Profound Martial House would take their life as recompense!\n On the contrary, if he killed someone during a battle, even though it was serious and flagrant violation of the Seven Profound Martial Houses regulations, it was not a crime worthy of death. After all, in matches where both parties’ strengths were similar, there were occasions that could cause death.\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/martial-world/mw-chapter-104","bookId":1508,"book":{"id":1508,"title":"Martial World","description":"In the Divine Realm, countless legends fought over a mysterious cube.
