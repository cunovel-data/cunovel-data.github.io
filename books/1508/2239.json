The Soul Emperor’s body seemed to have turned into a giant black hole, and even the surrounding space began to collapse, forming an absolute enchantment that covered everyone.\\n\\n Caught within this enchantment, Lin Ming, Ink, Clear, and Sheng Mei felt their strength suppressed and their power greatly reduced.\\n\\n Not just that, but Lin Ming discovered that the space surrounding them experienced strange qualitative changes; it became increasingly compact, simply indestructible!\\n\\n “The Soul Emperor has formed a projection of the world of the Demon God’s Tomb!”\\n\\n Lin Ming suddenly realized. Perhaps the Soul Emperor might not have the ability to suck them into the Demon God’s Tomb, but he could form a world projection and create an absolute domain.\\n\\n This world projection might not be as powerful as the true world of the Demon God’s Tomb, but if it were only used to deal with them then it was more than enough!\\n\\n “It’s over. All of you will die here!”\\n\\n The Soul Emperor attacked. The dark and cruel bone staff in his hand began to gather the power within the surrounding space, turning that bone staff into a lance which shined with cold brilliance!\\n\\n The space of the Demon God’s Tomb was incomparably stable and the lance formed by this space was also incomparably sharp, capable of destroying the mightiest defenses!\\n\\n “Fight!”\\n\\n Clear and Ink simultaneously burnt their blood essence. They had already solidified their will to die here. Even if they had to give everything they had, today they would heavily wound the Soul Emperor no matter what!\\n\\n And at this time, from behind Clear and Ink, Sheng Mei also attacked!\\n\\n During these years, Sheng Mei had gone to the Asura forbidden land by herself and had only just returned when Lin Ming began his fierce battle with the Soul Emperor; he didn’t have any idea what she had done during this time.\\n\\n Hah - !\\n\\n A cold wind blew. From within the space that the Soul Emperor had blocked in, a river of cold ice emerged from thin air!\\n\\n This river of ice flowed through space. The river waters were endless and smoky, the waves vast and monstrous, limitless and without bounds!\\n\\n Seeing this, Lin Ming was shocked. Within the world projection of the Demon God’s Tomb that the Soul Emperor formed, any Laws or energy would be suppressed by the world strength of the Demon God’s Tomb.\\n\\n Yet, Sheng Mei was able to use such a move in this environment. This left Lin Ming surprised. Sheng Mei, when did she become so strong?\\n\\n Rumble rumble rumble!\\n\\n The waters of the ice river parted and a giant ice plane soared up, camouflaging the void for a thousand miles. The Asura forbidden land’s Cold Ice Mirror!\\n\\n Lin Ming was dumbfounded; Sheng Mei had refined the Cold Ice Mirror?\\n\\n This Cold Ice Mirror was the supreme treasure of the Asura forbidden land; it could be called its foundation!\\n\\n “Seniors, let’s attack together!”\\n\\n As Sheng Mei spoke, she moved the Cold Ice Mirror before them.\\n\\n Clear and Ink were extremely quick to react. They didn’t ask why the Cold Ice Mirror was here, but simply took advantage of this time to pour all their energies into it.\\n\\n Lin Ming also flew forth. He placed his hands atop the Cold Ice Mirror and recklessly poured out the power of divinity and demons within him.\\n\\n Bang!\\n\\n The lance formed by the Soul Emperor violently clashed with the Cold Ice Mirror. Energy surged out in monstrous waves and beams of rainbow-hued energies blasted outwards. Even the world projection of the Demon God’s Tomb trembled, as if it would collapse.\\n\\n Ink, Clear, Sheng Mei, and Lin Ming violently shook. The impact of the strike passed through to them from the Cold Ice Mirror, crashing into their limbs and causing their blood vitality to tumble and their meridians to be damaged!\\n\\n Puff!\\n\\n The four of them spat out a mouthful of blood. With the Soul Emperor’s strength alone, he had brutally struck them back!\\n\\n “Mm? You also have such a technique left… this spirit treasure is… interesting, how interesting…”\\n\\n The Soul Emperor clearly recognized this Cold Ice Mirror. The appearance of it caused a playful smile to play upon his lips. “By relying on this spirit treasure you gathered your strength together to withstand my attack. But, how many times you can do this?”\\n\\n As the Soul Emperor spoke, layers of killing intent flashed within his dirty eyes. He reached out his arms and laid them flat. At this time, the surrounding space seemed to meld into his body.\\n\\n Then, strength was whipped up into a frenzy.\\n\\n Lin Ming grimaced. He was far too familiar with this strength. During the 1500 years that he had been in that period of deep seclusion, he had been refining this strength.\\n\\n This was the world strength of the Demon God’s Tomb!\\n\\n But now, in the domain that the Soul Emperor had formed, this world strength had become the most terrifying weapon.\\n\\n Within this sealed spaced, the Soul Emperor was the ruler.\\n\\n The Soul Emperor raised his hands and a storm of world strength rose up in the world, recklessly swirling about. This storm was like a flurry of sharp knives that constantly cut apart at the group of four’s protective barriers.\\n\\n A terrifying pressure shrouded their bodies. Everyone could feel the space around them tighten and contract. The world strength had turned into a cage that crashed down from them on all directions.\\n\\n The Cold Ice Mirror could easily block a frontal attack, but to block an attack that came from all directions was far more difficult.\\n\\n “Everyone, help me!”\\n\\n Seeing the storm of world strength about to swallow the four of them, Sheng Mei once again brought forth the Cold Ice Mirror.\\n\\n Without hesitation, she bit down on the tip of her tongue and spat out a mouthful of blood essence.\\n\\n Hum - !\\n\\n Hum - !\\n\\n Hum - !\\n\\n The Cold Ice Mirror fiercely trembled. A great energy began to condense from its smooth surface.\\n\\n Clear, Ink, and Lin Ming glanced at each other. Without a second thought, they poured their strength into the Cold Ice Mirror.\\n\\n A dark gray wave shot out from it!\\n\\n This wave looked unremarkable and was only the thickness of a bucket. But, it tore through the storm of world strength and shot towards the Soul Emperor like an arrow!\\n\\n Seeing this wave hurtle towards him, the Soul Emperor’s complexion slightly changed.\\n\\n “Mm? This strength is…”\\n\\n The Soul Emperor instantly realized that this was the strength sealed within the Cold Ice Mirror and not Sheng Mei’s own. Sheng Mei had only used her blood essence as the catalyst to unseal it!\\n\\n The Soul Emperor hastily drew backwards. At the same time, the vortex from the eye between his eyebrows reappeared once more. The world of the Demon God’s Tomb expanded and completely swallowed this strength.\\n\\n The Soul Emperor had used this same move of summoning the world of the Demon God’s Tomb to block off the Cold Ice Mirror’s attack.\\n\\n Ca!\\n\\n As this strength entered the world of the Demon God’s Tomb it didn’t explode at all. Rather, it tore through the void, continuing until the end!\\n\\n The Soul Emperor’s complexion paled a little bit. “This strength is from… Immortal?”\\n\\n The Soul Emperor’s eyebrow twitched. As this strength flew into the world of the Demon God’s Tomb, it disappeared without a trace.\\n\\n And from the Soul Emperor’s response, one couldn’t see that this attack had any effect just now.\\n\\n Sheng Mei’s heart sank. Although the Cold Ice Mirror was the Asura Road Master’s spirit treasure, the sealed strength she shot out just now was from her father. This was power of an incarnation that the Immortal Sovereign had forged in the past to protect and shelter her mother, and now it had been used by Sheng Mei.\\n\\n Perhaps because far too long a time had passed, or perhaps because the Soul Emperor’s ability of using the world of the Demon God’s Tomb to block attacks was too heaven-defying, but no matter what the reason was, nothing seemed to have happened to the Soul Emperor.\\n\\n “Even the strength that Father left behind cannot do anything to him, not even wound him?”\\n\\n Helplessness surged in Sheng Mei’s heart. Although that attack just now had torn through the storm of world strength, it hadn’t been able to wound the Soul Emperor. Like this, it would be difficult to withstand the Soul Emperor’s next attack. After all, every time she used the strength sealed within the Cold Ice Mirror it would be permanently weakened.\\n\\n “That might not be true…”\\n\\n Lin Ming suddenly said. His eyes blazed as he looked at the distant Soul Emperor. He said with a sound transmission, “It might not have been easy for him to block that attack.”\\n\\n “Mm?”\\n\\n Lin Ming’s words caused the hearts of the three others to shake.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/martial-world/mw-chapter-2219","bookId":1508,"book":{"id":1508,"title":"Martial World","description":"In the Divine Realm, countless legends fought over a mysterious cube.
