As he thought more and more about the calculations and deductions he just made, his eyes grew increasingly bright. The fire energy of the Havoc Flame Symbol was unable to match the Asura Heavenly Dao pattern structure, however, the truth was that there wasn’t a flaw in the Asura Heavenly Dao pattern construct but that Lin Ming’s Fire Laws were unable to reach the level of the Asura Heavenly Dao!\\n\\n If he could borrow help from Xiao Moxian’s nirvana flames and add in his own heavenly tribulation flames, combining the two types of flames together, just what would that be like?\\n\\n Lin Ming could feel that he had found the most essential point. As he was revising the Havoc Flame Symbol, he limited his viewpoint to the structure of the runes and the fusion of the Asura Heavenly Dao. But, he forgot the attack shape of the Havoc Flame Symbol – the destructive flame itself!\\n\\n Xiao Moxian’s flames were the nirvanic flames of a Dark Phoenix. These flames possessed the attribute of destruction.\\n\\n As for Lin Ming’s own heavenly tribulation flames, they also possessed the attribute of destruction.\\n\\n If both could perfectly fuse together then the Havoc Flame Symbol would be able to reach its greatest heights!\\n\\n Only this sort of perfect flame could better match the Asura Heavenly Dao.\\n\\n “Xian’er, let me borrow your nirvanic flames!” Lin Ming threw his remaining materials into the processing array formation as he excitedly spoke to Xiao Moxian.\\n\\n Xiao Moxian could also see that Lin Ming’s revision process had reached a critical point. She naturally wouldn’t play a game on Lin Ming because of her little bit of anger from being embarrassed just then. She flicked her finger and a black flame ignited in her palm.\\n\\n This flame seemed to have a mind of its own. It transformed into all different shapes in the air, like a Dark Phoenix dancing in the skies.\\n\\n Lin Ming thrust out his hand and opened the Heretical God Force. The heavenly tribulation flames were released by him. Compared to Xian Moxian’s flames, Lin Ming’s heavenly tribulation flames seemed more violent as if they would burn through the void.\\n\\n The two types of flames slowly melted into one.\\n\\n Originally, these two types of flames were destructive in nature, and combining them could easily cause an explosion. But for more than 20 years, Lin Ming and Xiao Moxian had lived together like a mortal couple and their thoughts and hearts had long since connected. Moreover, because they had been dual cultivating for such a long time and exchanged energy between their bodies countless times, their bodies were already in perfect harmony with each other.\\n\\n Thus, the two flames that Lin Ming and Xiao Moxian released fused together perfectly.\\n\\n The flames blazed red and black and then suddenly calmed down, quietly burning in the air. There didn’t seem to be any heat coming from this flame. There wasn’t the lively intelligence within Xiao Moxian’s nirvanic flames or the fiery savageness in Lin Ming’s heavenly tribulation flames.\\n\\n But, Lin Ming knew that this peaceful-seeming flame was actually terrifying. It didn’t seem to emit any heat because the heat condensed within the flames had reached the limit!\\n\\n Looking at this flame, Lin Ming flicked his ten fingers and constantly threw all sorts of materials into the array formation, quickly extracting, heating, grinding, and processing the juices to draw up the divine runic symbol.\\n\\n Lin Ming quickly wet his divine runic pen with these juices and started drawing.\\n\\n At this time Lin Ming had already consumed a great deal of his soul force. But because of the vivid excitement that wiped away all exhaustion from his eyes, he was more than capable of completing this divine runic symbol drawing.\\n\\n Time passed. Lin Ming drew the divine runic symbol in the air, the illustrious patterns leaving Xiao Moxian dazzled.\\n\\n After two hours, Lin Ming had finished!\\n\\n In that moment, the entire divine runic symbol emitted a brilliant luminesce, blinding to the eyes!\\n\\n Lin Ming took out a symbol talisman and rubbed the symbol in the rune on it, forming a complete divine runic symbol. The last step, fusing in the Asura Heavenly Dao, had already been deduced countless times by Lin Ming and was thoroughly memorized within his heart.\\n\\n Lin Ming revolved all the true essence within his body according to the Asura Sutra. Countless rune Laws gathered towards him, pouring themselves into the Havoc Flame Symbol. After an incense stick of time, the Havoc Flame Symbol was complete!\\n\\n Looking at the newly transformed Havoc Flame Symbol, Lin Ming was filled with all sorts of emotions. For this symbol paper that was only several inches long, he had paid a tremendous amount of time and effort and now his perseverance had borne fruit!\\n\\n This final product also had many flaws. It was because of Lin Ming’s current state of mind as well as some deductions still not being perfected. Thus, there were many areas to improve.\\n\\n Lin Ming estimated he would need another ten days to create a new and perfect Havoc Flame Symbol!\\n\\n “To create this flame symbol, one needs to reach the seventh level Concept in comprehensions of the Fire Laws. This flame symbol itself has also fused with nirvanic flames and heavenly tribulation flames, so let’s call it the Nirvanic Tribulation Flame Symbol.”\\n\\n Lin Ming casually made up a name for his own work. This Nirvanic Tribulation Flame Symbol represented the current peak of Lin Ming’s divine runic arts and understandings of the Asura Heavenly Dao Laws.\\n\\n He thought to himself that when he needed to refine the Ravenous Wolf Heaven Pill in the future as well as the other pills for the Nine Stars of the Dao Palace, he would need to rely on medicinal runic divine symbols. Thus, it would be best if he revised the medicinal runic symbols in order to increase the amount by which they enhanced a pill to its limit. At least it would help him not waste any of the precious materials he purchased.\\n\\n “You succeeded?” Xiao Moxian happily laughed from nearby.\\n\\n “Mm.” Lin Ming nodded. Although this work wasn’t perfect, ten days from now he would be able to draw a perfect Nirvanic Tribulation Flame Symbol. “Let’s go buy some more materials now.”\\n\\n In order to draw up 20 Nirvanic Tribulation Flame Symbols, Lin Ming estimated he would need another 30 portions of materials. The difficulty wasn’t minor to begin with and this was with the failure rate factored in.\\n\\n Thus, Lin Ming returned to the material sales section once again. By now, the price had risen by another 50%. This price was already over twice the normal price.\\n\\n Lin Ming didn’t haggle. He paid the nine sun jades and obtained the materials.\\n\\n After returning to his room, Lin Ming didn’t immediately set off on working. Rather, he sat in meditation for 20 hours, adjusting his breathing and mindset.\\n\\n Then, Lin Ming began his crazy drawing process. He used a total of eight days to draw up 21 divine runic symbols.\\n\\n The extra one was for Lin Ming to keep in hand.\\n\\n “You’re finally done?”\\n\\n Xiao Moxian happily asked as she saw the many divine runic symbols.\\n\\n “I’m done!”\\n\\n Every single divine runic symbol had the Lin character written on the bottom.\\n\\n This was the mark left behind by the creator. This sort of mark was left behind by the person’s sense, and because the fluctuations of every person’s sense were different, it wasn’t able to be faked.\\n\\n To a famous divine runic master, their mark was their brand. As long as their mark was left behind on a divine runic symbol it would cause the price to dramatically rise.\\n\\n Looking at the Lin character on the bottom right of the divine runic symbols, Lin Ming felt a deep sense of satisfaction. He wanted a brand of his own.\\n\\n During these ten days, Lin Ming had made a very important modification to the Nirvanic Tribulation Flame Symbol. This modification caused the power of the Nirvanic Tribulation Flame Symbol to be reduced by a great deal but it also caused it to have an unbelievably special effect.\\n\\n If this effect was known by other divine runic masters, it would create waves within the entirety of Divine Rune City.\\n\\n If Lin Ming wanted to earn 3 billion points he would have to depend on the quality of the divine runic symbols. It was impossible for him to rely on quantity.\\n\\n Lin Ming picked out one divine runic symbol from the stack of 21 and then brought the remaining 20 towards the Mission Division.\\n\\n It was currently night and the large Mission Division seemed particularly lonely. There were only a dozen some people present.\\n\\n Lin Ming immediately spotted Suya behind her counter at the end of the Mission Division Hall.\\n\\n Late at night, Suya was wearing a red silk dress, looking similar to a negligee. The loose silk dress wasn’t able to hide Suya’s explosive body.\\n\\n She was lazily lying back on a couch, her eyes closed and her eyelashes gently trembling, as if she was profoundly weary.\\n\\n Beside her was a small table made from iron vines with a glass of red wine on top of it.\\n\\n This kind of woman was originally a rare beauty of the world. No matter how she moved she would arouse 10,000 amorous and enchanting feelings.\\n\\n Suya had already noticed Lin Ming and didn’t care for him at all.\\n\\n It was only when Lin Ming stood in front of her counter and placed the 20 Nirvanic Tribulation Flame Symbols on the countertop did Suya slowly open her eyes.\\n\\n “I’m here to hand in the mission.”\\n\\n Lin Ming clearly said.\\n\\n Lin Ming swept her eyes over the 20 Nirvanic Tribulation Flame Symbols. Of course, in her eyes, they were Havoc Flame Symbols.\\n\\n Suya also had some achievements in the divine runic arts. She could see from a glance that there wasn’t a problem with these finished Havoc Flame Symbols.\\n\\n “You’ve finished…” Suya looked at Lin Ming with surprise. She took up the wine glass, taking a sip, without any expression on her face. “After three whole months, you’ve consumed 150 portions of materials to create 20 Havoc Flame Symbols…”\\n\\n Suya faintly spoke of Lin Ming’s ‘good work’.\\n\\n For a normal peak fourth grade divine runic master, it would usually take them around 10 days and 30 some portions of materials to draw up 20 Havoc Flame Symbols.\\n\\n But Lin Ming, whether it was time or materials, had used up eight or nine times that of an ordinary divine runic master. This was simply far too pathetic.\\n\\n And even so, Suya didn’t believe that Lin Ming had drawn up these divine runic symbols by himself. He likely had some Elders helping him, otherwise how could a young divine runic master draw up a peak fourth grade Havoc Flame Symbol?\\n\\n She believed that Lin Ming was using the missions she issued as a chance to practice his own divine runic arts. Suya didn’t feel good about this at all, especially when she had her own heavy mission weighing her down.\\n\\n However, no matter what was said, Lin Ming was still a young divine runic master with a bright future, otherwise it would have been impossible for him to obtain Elder Xue’s recognition. This was a point that she couldn’t deny.\\n\\n Thus, she didn’t mock Lin Ming. She simply said lazily, “You can leave them there and go.”\\n\\n The 20 Havoc Flame Symbols, when compared to 80,000 fourth grade divine runic symbols, were nothing but a drop in a bucket of water. There was naturally no need to have any great reaction at all.\\n\\n Still, it was a surprise that Lin Ming had completed this mission. She believed that he had simply come here to waste her time and play around three months ago.\\n\\n “Hey, just what sort of attitude is that!!”\\n\\n Xiao Moxian unhappily shouted! These were things that Lin Ming had worked diligently and arduously on for the last three months, neglecting to eat or sleep, and yet Suya was looking as if she didn’t care at all. How could Xiao Moxian not be annoyed by this?\\n\\n In her eyes, this sensual woman in front of her couldn’t even qualify as Lin Ming’s concubine, so what was she being so arrogant about?\\n\\n \\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/martial-world/mw-chapter-1603","bookId":1508,"book":{"id":1508,"title":"Martial World","description":"In the Divine Realm, countless legends fought over a mysterious cube.
