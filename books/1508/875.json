{"id":54820,"no":875,"title":"Chapter 872 The Bronze Ghost Coffin","content":"Chapter 872 – The Bronze Ghost Coffin … … … In the end, the Great Desolate Blood Halberd’s curse wasn’t able to be broken. In Demonshine’s opinion, the Great Desolate Blood Halberd already had the majority of its strength sealed away by the Asura Divine Kingdom, so most of the curse’s power was reduced. And throughout these years, Lin Ming had defeated countless heroic young elites and passed through multiple trials of fire. He was a peerless youth of this world and after accumulating all of that momentum so far, his destiny was extremely formidable. In addition, he had trained at Timeworn Phoenix City and also inherited the bloodline of the Ancient Phoenix. Lin Ming even had a drop of reverse scale blood from an Azure Dragon. With all of these factors combined together, Lin Ming’s life was that of a Peerless Emperor! It could be foreseen that, without accident, Lin Ming would easily become a character that surpassed the Divine Sea realm, or even reached higher boundaries. For such an absolute character to restrain a single Great Desolate Blood Halberd from the edge of the Eternal Demon Abyss shouldn’t be difficult. After all, the Great Desolate Blood Halberd could only be considered to be amongst the weakest of Saint artifacts. ……….. In the middle of night, Lin Ming changed his clothes and without wearing his wood spirit jade mask, he directly stepped through the transmission array and into the outer world. He didn’t fly high in the air but rather near the ground, all the way until he was over 2000 miles away from the Forsaken God Clan’s dimensional realm. Lin Ming then took out the Godspeed Boat that had been specially altered for him, and flew straight towards the Sea of Miracles. Along the way, Lin Ming carefully chose his route and avoided all major cities. Without danger or surprise, he soon reached the 8000 Mile Black Swamp. The 8000 Mile Black Swamp was known as a land where Life Destruction powerhouses would encounter almost certain death. If a Divine Sea powerhouse entered, they would be relatively safe. However, if they were unlucky then even they could perish here. Lin Ming was now nearly the strongest person under the Divine Sea within the Sky Spill Continent. In addition, he had many protective treasures with him. His fires of life were potent, his defensive power was abnormal, and his endurance and extreme speed limit were both freakish. In terms of survivability and escape capacity, here at the 8000 Mile Black Swamp, he wasn’t necessarily much worse than a Divine Sea powerhouse like Situ Bonan who was nearing the end of his life. After entering the 8000 Mile Black Swamp once again, Lin Ming was no longer the same late Revolving Core weakling he had been. In the face of the dangers here, he had enough strength to resist. Moreover, Lin Ming had already come to the 8000 Mile Black Swamp once before and was extremely familiar with the environment. Without any great danger, he soon arrived close to the center of the 8000 Mile Black Swamp. However, wanting to find this divine dragon was not simple. Although this sea serpent divine dragon had a body over a thousand miles long and emitted a gas that could cover the sun and moon, both space and time within this 8000 Mile Black Swamp were distorted and there were closed off force fields everywhere. It was impossible to search for this divine dragon using one’s perception. If one wished to find it, then they could only rely on their own luck. Soon, several days passed as Lin Ming searched the 8000 Mile Black Swamp, during which he encountered many of the strange and peculiar existences that lived here. There were creatures similar to ghosts, creatures of flesh and blood, and even creatures that looked as if they were formed from mud. However, since their strength was all below that of the Divine Sea, they simply weren’t a threat to the current Lin Ming. At this point, in front of Lin Ming, a 10 foot high humanoid monster appeared. Its skin was the color of a ghostly green and it was thickly corded with muscles. There was a single giant eye that dominated its head, and it grasped a mace that was larger than two men, waving it haphazardly in the wind! “Cyclops Demon!” Lin Ming was stunned and immediately recalled the name of this monster. This creature was an archaic desolate monster that existed in the ancient times of the Sky Spill Continent 100,000 ago. Sometimes it was tamed by top masters to be their mounts. This monster’s strength was incomparably powerful and its bodily defensive power was comparable to a heaven-step treasure. Its single eye could release a demonic light that sucked away all life vitality and turned the body to stone. Any random Cyclops Demon could absolutely be ranked anywhere in the top 20 of the Destiny Decree. And this was only because they had low intelligence. Otherwise, if they could practice cultivation methods, martial skills, and Concepts, then their combat efficiency could be imagined. The eye of a Cyclops Demons was an extremely rare and precious alchemy ingredient, and their tough skin could be used to make heaven-step leather armor. However, they were simply far too difficult to deal with. Even a top 10 ranked Destiny Decree master would find this task near-impossible and would be advised to avoid them. The Cyclops Demon’s defensive power was just too formidable and its blood vitality was too potent. If one couldn’t defeat it in a short period of time then that was a recipe for disaster. However, Lin Ming actually didn’t plan on avoiding it. He wanted to test the might of the Great Desolate Blood Halberd and he also fancied the bodily materials of the Cyclops Demon. He could keep the eye for his own use and the rest of the body could be given to the Forsaken God Clan to refine into treasures. Ca! A demonic light shot from the Cyclops Demon’s eye, beaming towards Lin Ming’s heart like a bolt of thunder. Lin Ming stepped on ‘Golden Roc Shattering the Void’ and vanished like a puff of smoke. In the next moment he had arrived behind the Cyclops Demon. He held the Great Desolate Blood Halberd with both hands and revolved the power of the Eight Inner Hidden Gates, using the Gate of Limit to erupt with over one million jins of strength, and the heavy Great Desolate Blood Halberd smashed down like a falling meteor where it struck the Cyclops Demon’s shoulder! Bang! With an explosive sound, the Cyclops Demon’s shoulder was twisted apart. Blood and broken pieces of bones shot into the wind. Because its feet couldn’t withstand the tremendous pressure, both of them fractured and buckled. The entire right side of the Cyclops Demon became ruined flesh and all of its ribs were broken even as its organs came spilling out! The Cyclops Demon that was famed for its amazing defensive power was smashed to death by Lin Ming’s halberd! “This halberd is awesome!” Lin Ming exclaimed out loud. Although he had erupted with his complete physical strength, he actually hadn’t used true essence. Striking with that halberd had caused his arm to tingle and his blood to tumble in his body, but even so, he felt a feeling of satisfaction as if all the cells in his body were stretching out at once and wantonly absorbing energy. By just moving his body he emitted crackling sounds from all his joints. This feeling of bliss was something that fighting with the essence gathering system could never achieve. Fighting with energy was still relying on non-bodily forces after all. If spear lights struck each other, no matter how intense the collision was, a martial artist would be safe as long as they weren’t affected by the shockwaves. It wasn’t like the body transformation fighting style, where every strike released an impact force that could be felt through the body. “Although I don’t use the ‘Great Desolate Halberd Art’ anymore, just using the Great Desolate Blood Halberd to hit people makes it a great weapon!” Lin Ming thought out loud. He was about to cut apart the Cyclops Demon’s corpse, when at this moment he felt his heart shrink a bit as an inexplicable chill covered his entire body. This sense of unease and dread caused him to look up into the distance. He could only see that far off through the dense layers of fog, there was a group of shimmering fluorescent shadows floating over like ghosts. These shadows looked as though they were slowly drifting, but the truth was that their speed had reached the extreme. At first they were only small lights in the distance, but in the blink of an eye one could make out their appearance. They were six sinister-looking evil spirits all dressed in black robes. Their faces were fierce and they drifted to and fro like ghosts. Their demon claws each grasped a thick chain, and the six chains linked together, dragging a bronze ghost coffin behind them. This ghost coffin was immeasurably large, being 10 feet high and 30 feet long. All sorts of strange and mystical totems were carved into the coffin, and it seemed heavy and terrible, emitting an energy that made the soul tremble. Lin Ming instantly felt a cold chill crawl up his spine! He held his breath and drew back as far into the shadows as he could, not even daring to move about. It wasn’t the coffin that these six evil spirits dragged that terrified him, but rather the six evil spirits themselves left Lin Ming gasping for breath. Because humans practiced a different cultivation system, Lin Ming couldn’t make out the cultivations of these evil spirits. But, he could still feel that all of them surpassed him by an immeasurable amount! Lin Ming himself already had a combat strength that reached the very pinnacle of all Life Destruction masters. Anyone higher would be at the legendary eighth stage of Life Destruction or the Divine Sea. And, these six evil spirits had strength nearing that of a human Divine Sea Supreme Elder! They were likely equal to quasi Emperor existences of the Fey race and Giant Demon race! These six quasi Emperor level powerhouses were all pulling a bronze ghost coffin together! Just what was in the ghost coffin? Lin Ming didn’t think that it would contain only a corpse. Even if it were a corpse, it would be some strange demonic monster like a 10,000 year corpse devil or corpse puppet. And what was most likely was that whatever was inside that bronze ghost coffin was an existence from the same race as those six black-robed evil spirits. And, its strength must be unimaginable! The 8000 Mile Black Swamp was known as a land that Life Destruction martial artists would find perilous, but a Divine Sea Supreme Elder wouldn’t be in too great of a danger. Thus, that mysterious existence within that bronze ghost coffin shouldn’t belong to the 8000 Mile Black Swamp. Otherwise, if a normal Divine Sea powerhouse were to encounter it, they would be more than dead! Did that mean… it was something that came from the true Sea of Miracles!? As this thought suddenly flashed through his mind, Lin Ming’s heartbeat nearly stopped. At this moment, he was very clear that if the monster in that bronze ghost coffin had even the slightest bit of interest in him then he would most assuredly die here! The bronze ghost coffin was extremely fast. It only took a few breaths of time to travel several hundred miles away. However, to Lin Ming, every breath of time felt as long as a year. Ho - ! The ghost coffin flew away, floating right over Lin Ming’s head before vanishing without a trace. The endless dark clouds on the horizon didn’t have the slightest hint of light, as if complete darkness had fallen over the entire 8000 Mile Black Swamp. They left… Lin Ming felt his back and palms wet with a cold sweat. He knew that if that mysterious existence in that coffin had investigated its surroundings, there was no way he could have hidden from it. It was possible that it might have been sleeping, or it might have been because Lin Ming’s own first stage Life Destruction cultivation was too low to arouse interest. But no matter the reason, he had just passed a great calamity. Just what was that… Wiping away his cold sweat, Lin Ming was still shaken with shock and alarm. He had originally been planning on exploring the 8000 Mile Black Swamp some more, but now it seemed as if it would be prudent to obtain the Sea Serpent Crystals and leave here as soon as possible. Against a powerhouse of that level, he didn’t believe he could resist even a tiny bit. Lin Ming hurriedly put away the Cyclops Demon’s corpse and immediately left. He displayed his movement technique and rushed towards the opposite direction of bronze ghost coffin, rapidly flying ahead! However, before even an incense stick of time passed, he instantly came to a screeching halt. His breath caught in his throat and a chill crawled up his spine. In front of him was a dirty dark yellow river that surged with great billowing waves, emitting an infinite deathly energy. The Yellow Springs River!!!
