Her delicate newborn body was fair and enchanting, as flawless as jade. At this time, her long hair danced about her and her entire body was bathed in sparkling starlight, like an immortal goddess. If anyone were to see Xiao Moxian now, they would inevitably feel a sense of shame and inferiority in her presence.\n “Lin Ming!”\n Xiao Moxian brightly smiled as she looked down and saw Lin Ming. Then, she rushed downwards like a little bunny, her bare body flying into Lin Ming’s arms.\n A jade warmth in his arms, the fragrance of a young woman, and also the residual aura of the flames of nirvana – all of this was like a dream, leaving one enchanted.\n Xiao Moxian would never have imagined that this round of dual cultivation would have given her so many benefits. She had brought the yin yang energies within to harmony, not only allowing her to break past the Divine Lord bottleneck but also helping her complete her first nirvana.\n The earlier a phoenix experienced nirvana, the better. However, even more so for a phoenix with a royal bloodline, it was still extremely rare that they would undergo nirvana at Xiao Moxian’s current boundary.\n Xiao Moxian held onto Lin Ming. Without any explanation, she wrapped her arms around his neck and deeply kissed him. Beneath her lips, her tongue played with his for a long time, only then reluctantly separating.\n She coyly looked at Lin Ming as she flavored the aftertaste on her tongue. Her kiss with Lin Ming was just like holding hands with him, allowing her to equalize their energies. Of course, this effect was ten times greater than with just holding hands. It was like not only their energies connected, but their life forces and even their souls, leaving them both enthralled. This was countless times more wonderful than when mortals kissed.\n Xiao Moxian didn’t seem satisfied with kisses alone. She licked her lips and said, “Lin Ming, I’m in love with this feeling. I want to experience it again and again and again.”\n As Xiao Moxian spoke she was about to reach down to deliver her fragrant lips onto Lin Ming’s once more. But at this time, Primordius Heavenly Palace violently shook as another blood seal came crashing down.\n “Tian Mingzi!”\n As this blood seal fell down, Lin Ming and Xiao Moxian each struck out, crushing that blood seal to nothing!\n After passing through and being weakened by Primordius Heavenly Palace’s array formation, Tian Mingzi’s blood seal didn’t have much strength remaining. It was easily broken apart by Lin Ming and Xiao Moxian at their full strength.\n “This drop dead old geezer.” Xiao Moxian grit her teeth. She was an extremely vengeful individual. Tian Mingzi had cultivated in Empyrean Demondawn’s domain for many years and had even trained in a part of the Heaven Absorbing Demon Art, receiving the graciousness of Demondawn Heavenly Palace. Yet not only did he not return the favor to Demondawn Heavenly Palace, but he even wanted to take Xiao Moxian for his alchemy. How could she not hate him?\n “Lin Ming, you try and break into the Nine Stars of the Dao Palace once more. Then, you and I will join forces to strike down this old bastard!” Xiao Moxian spoke up, her words brimming with confidence. This was the confidence that came from strength.\n Xiao Moxian had gone through the equivalent of two breakthroughs just now. The first was breaking into the Divine Lord realm and the second was experiencing a phoenix nirvana. There was no comparing her previous strength with her current state.\n “Good, that’s always what I intended to do!” Lin Ming’s eyes burst out with a sharp light. At this time, the foundation of his mortal body had reached an indescribable degree!\n Lin Ming’s mortal body contained the incomparably pure phoenix and dragon blood that had begun to fuse together. Not just that, but he also had the strength of the Essence Spirit Embryo Stone and the Grandmist Spirit Bead essence. With all of this gathered together with the accumulations Lin Ming gained during the years, his mortal body had reached a truly heaven-defying realm!\n What was defying the heavens? That was to break through the Heavenly Dao rules and to defy the will of the heavens!\n Lin Ming let go of Xiao Moxian. He took a deep breath as he released the Eight Inner Hidden Gates to their limits.\n Ka ka ka ka!\n His joints released explosive crackling sounds. This sort of sound shook the body, even causing one’s eardrums to tremble. Atop Lin Ming’s head, the light of the nine stars suddenly shined brightly yet again. He wanted to attack the Nine Stars of the Dao Palace once more!\n The Nine Stars of the Dao Palace had held Lin Ming down for far, far too long. Even if he were to attack this boundary now, he would still encounter numerous difficulties, each one harder than the last.\n But now, the moment Lin Ming had been waiting for had finally arrived. With his absolute strength he would break through these shackles!\n Weng - !\n Energy trembled in the skies. The lines of the Great Dao reappeared. Above Lin Ming, the nine star dao diagram reformed!\n The dao diagram wove together, forming a massive net that pressed down towards Lin Ming!\n Lin Ming was already prepared. He roared out loud, all the strength within his body erupting like a volcano!\n One billion jins, two billion jins, three billion jins… and still rising!\n Only when his strength neared four billion jins did it slow. At this time, Lin Ming’s fists could break down mountains and rivers and tear through space!\n “Celestial Tyrant Manual – Hundred Layered Waves!”\n A strength of four billion jins, when used by the Hundred Layered Waves technique, was magnified multiple times. Lin Ming’s strength rose once more, surpassing the critical point of 10 billion jins!\n In ancient times, strength of 10 billion jins had a specific title – that was, the strength of a dragon!\n This wasn’t implying that the mortal bodily strength of a True Dragon was only 10 billion jins. Rather, it was a description of a martial artist’s bodily strength. Once their strength broke past 10 billion jins, it would experience a qualitative change!\n Kacha!\n Lin Ming’s fist smashed into the nine star dao diagram!\n The nine star dao diagram violently shook, seeming as if it would disintegrate at any moment!\n An alarming crack ripped through the nine star dao diagram; the Heavenly Dao Laws were about to be torn down by Lin Ming!\n After a great chunk of the dao diagram was torn apart, faint strands of starlight fell through the dao diagram and shined onto Lin Ming. This starlight gathered into Lin Ming’s body, circulating through his limbs and bones. In an instant, Lin Ming felt his flesh and blood become far more powerful and far more solid.\n This starlight gathered somewhere in his body, seeming as if it would form its own Dao Palace!\n Once the Dao Palace formed, this would be the true Nine Stars of the Dao Palace!\n “I’ve only absorbed a little bit of starlight and yet my body has obtained so many advantages. If I can truly follow what the ancient texts say and refine a star into my body, then what boundary will the intensity of my body reach? If I can refine all nine stars into my body and form my own dao diagram in the skies, then even an Empyrean won’t be my match!”\n In that moment, a heroic feeling surged in Lin Ming’s heart. His road of martial arts was without end; it was impossible to say where the limit lay! Extreme Empyrean, True Divinity, neither of these were Lin Ming’s end goal because he wanted to surpass all of this!\n Ka ka ka ka!\n Lin Ming gripped his fists, his joints exploding. With a roar, he punched out a second time.\n Bang!\n The gap in the dao diagram tore even wider. More and more starlight flowed out.\n Lin Ming greedily absorbed this starlight, feeling his mortal body strengthen. His punched out again and again, his fists crashing into the dao diagram until they were stained with blood and his arms were numb!\n The nine star dao diagram represented the rules of the Heavenly Dao, beyond reproach. Even if Lin Ming were to barrage the dao diagram with the strength of a dragon he still wouldn’t be able to safely break it open.\n Whenever the energy within his body became chaotic and his blood began to tumble about, within Lin Ming’s inner world, the harmonized dragon and phoenix energy would turn into a dragon and phoenix phantom that raced through his body. Then, Lin Ming’s aura would immediately become much smoother.\n “I’ve already torn open 90%, I’m almost there!”\n Lin Ming’s eyes flashed with a severe light. The more he attacked, the fiercer his attacks became. Although there was only 10% of the dao diagram remaining, this last 10% was the most solid and most difficult to break apart. In order to do so he would need to consume a massive amount of energy and blood vitality.\n And at this time, outside of Primordius Heavenly Palace, Tian Mingzi saw that the nine stars hanging above him, which had just dimmed down, had suddenly become several times brighter than they were at the start!\n In particular, the star known as Army Breaker was releasing a light as luminescent as a full moon, causing one’s will to tremble!\n “How could this be? How is this possible!?”\n Tian Mingzi was dumbfounded. He had clearly driven Lin Ming to the edge of despair. In order to do this, he had not hesitated to consume his life force, consume his blood essence, and risk permanently damaging his future cultivation forever.\n He felt that he had already used all possible methods to their limit. And in truth, everything he did seemed to have succeeded. The starlight of the nine stars had dimmed down and they seemed as if they would vanish at any moment. No one would ever expect that they would suddenly brighten up by thousands of times.\n “Damn it all!”\n Tian Mingzi didn’t believe in superstitions. He clenched his teeth, taking out more pills from his spatial ring and swallowing them down!\n His face flushed as red as blood. His hands flickered as numerous blood seals were formed by him.\n These blood seals were all intended to stir one’s heart demons. Tian Mingzi’s eyes flashed with a grim light as he sent these blood seals all smashing into Primordius Heavenly Palace!\n This was a move that consumed Tian Mingzi’s blood vitality in order to cast. The foundation of a Great World King’s body was far too terrifying. If an ordinary World King were to attempt such a move in this state, they might have withered away to dust.\n At this time, within Primordius Heavenly Palace, Lin Ming only sneered as he saw all of these blood seals fly towards him. If there wasn’t the protection of Primordius Heavenly Palace and Tian Mingzi was directly attacking Lin Ming, then Lin Ming absolutely would not have been able to withstand this attack. But within Primordius Heavenly Palace, everything Tian Mingzi did was merely wasting his own strength.\n “Body Tearing Bone Shattering Fist!”\n With his strength of four million jins, Lin Ming struck out with the Body Tearing Bone Shattering Fist. This was strength training’s ‘flow like silk’ that was recorded in the Chaotic Virtues Combat Meridians. In the past, the Chaotic Virtues Combat Meridians stated that those who practiced flow like silk to the highest boundary could turn their own energy into a trillion strands and turn anything they punched into dust!\n And now, Lin Ming had clearly surpassed this boundary!\n His fists smashed into the blood seals. After being severely weakened by Primordius Heavenly Palace’s array formation, these blood seals simply exploded into the tiniest motes of energy.\n Lin Ming punched out again and again, smashing all these blood seals apart. Then, he grit his teeth and erupted his bodily strength to the limit. The Gate of Life’s blood essence burned and the power of dragons and phoenixes erupted. He shot into the skies, firing right into the nine star dao diagram!\n “Break, Nine Stars of the Dao Palace!”\n At this time, Lin Ming was no different from a blazing meteor. He poured his complete strength into this one strike and even used the Gate of Life to burn 20% of his blood essence. This could be described as an all-out attack!\n Kacha!\n Lin Ming’s fist crashed into the final flaw of the nine star dao diagram!\n In that moment, the nine star dao diagram finally shattered! Nine stars, seven bright and two dark, appeared in front of Lin Ming!\n A powerful impact rushed through Lin Ming’s blood but he didn’t care about this at all. As long as he could break through to the Nine Stars of the Dao Palace and baptize himself underneath the powerful starlight, everything would recover. Moreover, his mortal body would reach its peak condition.\n He spotted the direction of the Army Breaker Star and hurtled towards it!\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/martial-world/mw-chapter-1534","bookId":1508,"book":{"id":1508,"title":"Martial World","description":"In the Divine Realm, countless legends fought over a mysterious cube.
