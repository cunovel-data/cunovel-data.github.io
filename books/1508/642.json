This little thing was truly unsightly, in fact, it was extremely ugly.\n Demonshine chortled, “Hehe, this thing is a heavenly treasure to a corpse sect. A corpse sect martial artist would definitely pay an exorbitantly high price to buy this 10,000 Year Corpse Grass!”\n Corpse sect… Lin Ming was aware that there were some martial artists that would collect the bodies of powerhouses and use them to refine weapons, create puppets, or even seize their bodies. For instance, the Seven Profound Valley’s Mugu Buyu could have been classified as a type of corpse sect martial artist.\n Lin Ming wrapped this 10,000 Year Corpse Grass in layers of seals before stashing it away into a jade box.\n “Lin Ming, where do we go now?” Demonshine asked. The two of them had already reached the 1200 mile radius zone of the Eternal Demon Abyss. If they went much closer, they would approach the 1000 mile radius forbidden death zone.\n This 1000 mile radius forbidden death zone was an area where even birds couldn’t cross. Entry into it meant absolute death!\n As for those places near this 1000 mile radius forbidden zone, those were also extremely dangerous.\n Lin Ming asked, “Did the Demon Emperor enter the 1000 mile radius forbidden zone in the past?”\n “Of course.” Demonshine scoffed as if this were something that simply didn’t need to be asked. “The 1000 mile radius forbidden death zone is only a relative name given to it. If your cultivation is high enough, then although you might not be able to freely come and go as you please, you don’t need to fear it too much. In the past, when the Demon Emperor stayed here for twenty some years, most of that time was in the 1000 mile radius forbidden death zone!”\n “I see.”\n Lin Ming wasn’t crazy enough to think he had the qualifications to enter such a place. His plan was to come to the edge of this 1000 mile radius forbidden zone; it would be his best opportunity for finding lucky chances. But, if he couldn’t find anything, he had still broken through to the Revolving Core realm. Now he had the ability to return to the South Horizon Region.\n Towards someone like Xuan Wuji, Lin Ming definitely wasn’t his match. But, when it came to those first stage Life Destruction Elders of the South Horizon Region, Lin Ming believed that he could kill them.\n ………………………..\n In a flash, several days passed. Lin Ming had been wandering around the 1100 to 1000 mile radius of the Eternal Demon Abyss. His days here were actually quite peaceful.\n Until this moment, when Demonshine’s voice suddenly sounded out in his mind, “Lin Ming, in the front to the right, 10 miles away, there are people there!”\n “Oh?” Lin Ming was startled, “How many?”\n “I’m not sure, they are too far away right now. I only felt a fluctuation of energy, but this fluctuation should be from a martial artist, not an evil spirit.”\n Lin Ming pondered for a moment, “Ok, let’s go look for them!”\n There were many advantages to being together with other martial artists. Lin Ming quickly displayed his movement technique and rushed towards the direction that Demonshine had indicated.\n However, just as he took a single step he felt the ground beneath him start to suddenly shake. Far away, he could see the ground splitting apart, a plume of black energy gushing out of the earth and shooting towards the skies!\n “Mm?”\n Lin Ming was shocked. What was happening?\n “Something’s wrong!” Demonshine’s voice changed. “The infernal energy has begun to frantically move, and those several people I discovered are now running towards here!”\n As Demonshine finished speaking, Lin Ming could see several moving figures within the endless fog. They were all running towards the Eternal Demon Abyss as if their lives depended on it!\n Just as this thought flashed through Lin Ming’s mind, his complexion immediately changed. He could see that behind these people were massive black clouds, chasing them down like a massive tsunami!\n And these black clouds contained a terrifying energy!\n “Damn!”\n Lin Ming cursed in his mind. He swiveled on the balls of his feet and ran away.\n He could no longer afford the time to think about what this was. The jade slip left behind by the Polaris Tower Master had never mentioned something like this.\n Lin Ming was fast, but the people behind him weren’t slow either. Because of that slight delay, they had already rushed up to just several hundred feet from Lin Ming.\n In the instant that Lin Ming turned around, he could clearly make one of the people.\n It was Duanmu Qun!\n There was no longer time to ask what was going on. Lin Ming’s feet stepped upon Golden Rock Shattering the Void and he shot forwards at the limits of his speed.\n The massive tsunami of dark clouds was like an ancient great beast, swallowing everything that it passed by. As the black clouds surged forth, they rose nearly 1000 feet high into the sky. The energy inherent within them caused anyone to lack any courage to face it.\n But, wanting to dodge these demonic clouds of infernal energy by flying was impossible; this was because flying was impossible within the Eternal Demon Abyss. In terms of speed, the demonic clouds were even several times faster than a normal martial artist! As everyone ran with all their might, they could still see that the black tsunami behind them was closing in!\n “Ahh!”\n A vague scream broke out. Lin Ming didn’t need to look back to know that a martial artist had been swallowed up by those dark clouds. His fate could be imagined!\n As the infernal energy around him twisted into stormy currents, Lin Ming used the Concept of Space, shrinking the space beneath his feet and displaying the limit of his speed. He was faster than everyone else behind him, but he still wasn’t as fast as that tsunami of demonic clouds!\n But at this moment, a sharp light flashed in his eyes. In front of him, at the very edge of the thick fog, he could make out a black mountain peak!\n Looking at the height of that mountain, it had to be several thousand feet high.\n Lin Ming was overjoyed. Without words, he immediately launched Golden Roc Shattering the Void and rushed straight to the top of that mountain peak!\n Although seeing a mountain didn’t mean it was close, because of the fog that obscured his vision, when Lin Ming saw the mountain peak it was already not too far away.\n With his extreme speed, he reached the base of the mountain in just several dozen breaths of time!\n Using his max speed, Lin Ming rushed to the peak in a single go. As he turned around, he could see at the bottom the mountain there were several other martial artists who had set foot on the black mountain and were racing to the top.\n Now, the tsunami of demonic black clouds was near. As it surged forwards, even the ground beneath him trembled. Looking at how terrifying this cloud was, Lin Ming feared that even this mountain would break under its impact.\n “Just what was that?” Lin Ming asked, frightened.\n “Hehe, you’re quite lucky. Those black clouds are an eruption from the Eternal Demon Abyss. Normally, after the Eternal Demon Abyss erupted, it will enter into a stable period and not erupt for decades or centuries. But, I don’t know what happened this time, so I said that you’re lucky…” Demonshine’s facetious voice sounded out in Lin Ming’s mind. When the Demon Emperor had stayed in the Eternal Demon Abyss, he had also faced these eruptions.\n “This is an eruption of the Eternal Demon Abyss?” Lin Ming was shocked. The Eternal Demon Abyss only erupted every several decades or even centuries. When it did erupt, it would spit out a massive amount of infernal energy as well as Demon God Bones and the terrifying evil beings from the depths of the Eternal Demon Abyss.\n After the eruption of the Eternal Demon Abyss, the energy here would all be in chaos, with layers upon layers of danger zones appearing everywhere. This was the time when the chance of dying in the Eternal Demon Abyss was the highest, but, this also meant that this was the time for the luckiest chances. Thus, when the Eternal Demon Abyss had just had an eruption was also the time when the highest amount of martial artists would enter.\n At this moment, Lin Ming couldn’t bother with these details. All he heard was a loud banging noise as the massive tsunami of black clouds smashed into the mountain, creating turbulent flows of energy thousands of feet high. The black mountain peak trembled. It seemed as if it couldn’t withstand this massive impact force and could collapse at any moment!\n A great chunk of the mountain was directly ripped away by the tsunami of demonic clouds. A martial artist that hadn’t climbed fast enough cried out miserably as he was directly sucked up by the black clouds, disappearing without a trace.\n But at the front of the group, Duanmu Qun and the rest had already rushed to the peak, luckily avoiding the impact of the black clouds.\n Lin Ming looked down. Not too far away, he could see that the always refined and calm Duanmu Qun was panting, his forehead dripping with sweat and his face flushed red. In that horrifying encounter just now, he had obviously consumed a great deal of energy.\n Behind Duanmu Qun, there were also two Fey Heavenly Demon Seven Star martial artists as well as three Giant Demon martial artists.\n Those two Fey martial artists were Feng Shen and Lan Xin.\n As for the Giant Demon martial artists, Lin Ming only knew one of them; Great Ax Tower’s Blackstone.\n Blackstone was also a descendant of a Holy Land. As someone that came from a Giant Demon Holy Land, his talent was no less than Feng Shen’s.\n “Lin Ming!?”\n When Duanmu Qun first saw Lin Ming, he was incomparably shocked. Before this, he had heard from Lan Xin’s own mouth about Lin Ming’s fate. He thought that Lin Ming had already perished here, but he never would have imagined he would see him right now, in these circumstances.\n As the others noticed Lin Ming, Feng Shen also saw him. He was a bit stunned, but then soon felt relieved. He hadn’t believed that someone like Lin Ming would die here, and his faith now seemed rewarded.\n The one who was the most surprised was Lan Xin. She had personally experienced that demon bone danger zone and knew how terrifying it was. She had seen him walk back to that danger zone and not return after an hour. Although she said that Lin Ming was missing, her heart had already determined that Lin Ming had died there. But, she never expected that she would see Lin Ming in front of her right now.\n Did he break out of that danger zone by himself and travel the thousands of miles across the Eternal Demon Abyss until finally reaching the central region?\n How had he done this?\n It wasn’t just Lan Xin that thought this unbelievable, but also others. Travelling by oneself was much, much more dangerous than forming a team, and Lin Ming didn’t even have a guide!\n But at this moment, Feng Shen’s heart stirred. Stunned, he looked at Lin Ming and said, “You broke through to Revolving Core?”\n Lin Ming faintly smiled at Feng Shen, “Brother Feng Shen, I’m glad to meet you here. I just happened to stumble across a relatively safe place in the Eternal Demon Abyss and made a lucky breakthrough.”\n Lin Ming’s casual few words left everyone flabbergasted.\n There are safe zones in the Eternal Demon Abyss? Breaking through to Revolving Core here? Aren’t you just wanting to die?\n Moreover, Lin Ming’s cultivation had only just reached the half-step Revolving Core realm previously. According to a reasonable rate of progression, it should have taken him at least half a year. How had he managed to achieve this so quickly?\n Did he find some lucky chance within the Eternal Demon Abyss?\n This was the only explanation!\n “Brother Lin has really good luck, hm!” Blackstone sourly said. Lin Ming’s breakthrough in this journey to the Eternal Demon Abyss had surpassed the totality of his harvests so far.\n Good luck?\n Lan Xin wasn’t sure, but in the instant she discovered that Lin Ming had made a breakthrough, she already knew deep within herself just where Lin Ming had found his lucky chance.\n Initially, back when they were in that danger zone, Lin Ming had casually made an excuse to go back because he had lost a spatial ring. But, the truth was that he had discovered some lucky chance there, thus he went back to look for it!\n But… there was a powerful and fearful evil being lurking within that danger zone, so strong that it only needed a second to kill a High Lord level powerhouse! In that sort of situation, how could Lin Ming have discovered a lucky chance and how could he have taken that lucky chance from the keeping of that evil being?\n How had any of this been done?\n Lan Xing subconsciously covered her mouth.\n Currently, she only felt that this Lin Ming in front of her was increasingly mysterious.\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/martial-world/mw-chapter-641","bookId":1508,"book":{"id":1508,"title":"Martial World","description":"In the Divine Realm, countless legends fought over a mysterious cube.
