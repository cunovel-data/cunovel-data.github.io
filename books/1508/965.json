But in this chaos, Lin Ming was actually like a fish in water.\\n\\n After the first meteor exploded, the second meteor followed immediately after, then the third, the fourth...\\n\\n More and more meteors plummeted toward the world. They were beams of brilliant light that covered the sky. When Lin Ming was within the God Transforming Mirror in Timeworn Phoenix City, the meteors dropped down one at a time. But now, dozens of meteors fell together as if the apocalypse had arrived!\\n\\n Amongst these meteors, besides the miles wide meteors, there were also those that were only the size of a fist. To all common sense, these sorts of mini meteors shouldn’t pose any threat to Lin Ming. But the truth was just the opposite. These mini meteors were even more dangerous to Lin Ming.\\n\\n These mini meteors were a hundred times faster than the larger meteors. Moreover, they contained an incomparably destructive energy and also contained the Annihilation Laws of pure fire. Every mini meteor was the same as an explosive missile. Every time one fell to the earth, a convulsive detonation would follow!\\n\\n Bang!\\n\\n A fist sized meteor exploded less than 100 feet from Lin Ming. Lin Ming’s protective true essence was attacked by the meteor’s shockwave. With a series of snapping sounds, cracks began to appear in his protective true essence!\\n\\n At this moment, three meteors also fell down on all sides, each the size of a bowl. These three meteors were far too fast; they blocked off all directions for Lin Ming to escape, wanting to pin him to death.\\n\\n “Golden Roc Shattering the Void!”\\n\\n Lin Ming’s thoughts stirred. He wanted to use Space Distortion but he was surprised to discover that the space here was far too stable. In the lower realms, Lin Ming could cross several miles with a single step, but now crossing even a dozen feet was difficult.\\n\\n “Mystic Lightning Shade!”\\n\\n At this critical moment, the 12 thunder escape symbols within Lin Ming’s body erupted with a blazing light. He forcefully accelerated to the extreme speed of thunder. However, without the support of Space Distortion, his speed wasn’t comparable to those bowl sized meteors.\\n\\n A meteor exploded close to where Lin Ming was.\\n\\n Bang!\\n\\n Lin Ming violently shook as his protective true essence exploded. Wild fire energy rampantly stampeded into his body. It directly tore apart his clothes, which were formed from thunder silk, and began ravaging his meridians!\\n\\n This fire energy was filled with the terrifying aura of the Law of Annihilation. Lin Ming’s complexion paled and he nearly spat out a mouthful of blood.\\n\\n Even the Heretical God Sprout wasn’t able to immediately suppress such a crazy and potent fire energy; it required some time to do so. The raging energy of the meteor was simply too ferocious; it caused Lin Ming to receive some minor damage to his meridians.\\n\\n In this land like hell where there was nothing but scenes of destruction, Lin Ming fell into a trap of flames! A crazy fire carried with it an annihilating aura as it rushed toward him. Above Lin Ming was a barrier of meteors and underneath him were endless flames. Lin Ming couldn’t even use Space Distortion; there was nowhere for him to evade!\\n\\n As Lin Ming was soon about to be engulfed by this devastating fire, he loudly shouted out and a red lotus flower suddenly bloomed behind him.\\n\\n Heavenly Demon martial intent – grandmist space!\\n\\n Grandmist was infinity. Infinity gave birth to the primal chaos, and the primal chaos transformed into yin and yang. First there was grandmist, then there was primal chaos, after primal chaos was the division of yin and yang, and finally there was the formation of the five elements. The Fire Laws was one of these five elements. Within the grandmist space that extinguished all Laws, it would naturally be restrained!\\n\\n Ssssss!\\n\\n Underneath the cover of the grandmist space, the flames rapidly melted away!\\n\\n “Break for me!”\\n\\n Lin Ming took this chance and swung his halberd. The 800,000 jin Great Desolate Blood Halberd carried Lin Ming’s full strength, falling down like an avalanche from heaven.\\n\\n The waves of flames as high as a mountain were directly split apart by the halberd!\\n\\n “Blood of the Ancient Phoenix, combust!”\\n\\n After breaking through these choppy waves of flames, a golden light began shining from between Lin Ming’s eyebrows, emitting a glorious and majestic light. A golden phoenix phantom formed behind him, appearing as if it would fuse with the world.\\n\\n Ca – !\\n\\n The flame phoenix cried out, directly soaring into the endless skies. All of the surrounding fire energy was mixed up by this phoenix, turning into a storm of flames.\\n\\n Lin Ming fused together with the flame phoenix. He pointed his blood halberd towards the skies where the countless meteors were.\\n\\n Reverse the Chain of Stars!\\n\\n The boundless grandmist battle spirit converged with the halberd light, bringing with it the power of chaos that annihilated all Laws as it crashed into the chain of meteors in the sky.\\n\\n Within the second world of the God Transforming World, the chain of stars that was formed from countless stones actually revolved according to some mysterious rule. And the chain of stars in Saint Artifact Pavilion was also the same.\\n\\n In the skies, countless pieces of stones stuck together, slowly condensing into new meteors, some of which were fist-sized mini meteors that dazzled with a flaming light. Although these mini meteors were small, they were extremely dangerous. As for meteors that were dimmer, they were slower but also became giant meteors with great destructive power.\\n\\n These meteors all floated in a seething fog of fire. As long as they meteors were fully formed, they would be thrust down under the support of the annihilating energy.\\n\\n This was not the first time that Lin Ming encountered the space of annihilation. The strange patterns of revolution within the stones and flames were reflected in his eyes. His attack was to be aimed at the crux of the rules of revolution!\\n\\n “Break!”\\n\\n Lin Ming shouted out loud. On top of the Great Desolate Blood Halberd, the power of fire gathered into a red dao diagram. The Purple Lion Thunder Source absorbed into the Heretical God Seed also howled as it rushed out, forming out a larger, mightier purple dao diagram in the air.\\n\\n The two dao diagrams fused into one. A terrifying thunderfire energy exploded outward. This energy gathered into a raging torrent of thunderfire that directly interrupted the revolving route of the chain of stars!\\n\\n As the revolving route shattered, there was a crackling sound as all of the meteors taking shape suddenly broke apart.\\n\\n The chain of stars was forcefully ripped apart by Lin Ming. With it, the falling meteors became much less concentrated and the pressure on Lin Ming was reduced several times over.\\n\\n “Mm?”\\n\\n The artifact spirit that had been hiding within Saint Artifact Pavilion while viewing Lin Ming’s progress was shocked. “He broke the chain of stars! My original intention was that if he could withstand it for half an hour, it would be considered as passing the test of Concept. I never imagined he would be able to break the chain of stars!”\\n\\n “But he did not rely on just the Fire Concepts to do this; his understandings into the Fire Concepts aren’t too extraordinary. The reason he could accomplish this is because he was able to fuse Thunder Concepts with Fire Concepts, as well as that mysterious force field. I wonder, just what is that force field? It was actually able to melt away the Fire Laws…”\\n\\n Saint Artifact Pavilion artifact spirit muttered. It didn’t know about the Primordius martial intent. Just what sort of existence was Empyrean Primordius? His status was even a level higher than a World King. He was one of the true top powerhouses of the entire Divine Realm! Within the entire Divine Realm, there were an extremely small number of people that could see an Empyrean. Even a character on the level of a World King or Holy Lord would find it extremely difficult to see an Empyrean. As for those that were actually able to see an Empyrean fight, they were a minority amongst minorities!\\n\\n To the vast majority of martial artists in the Divine Realm, an Empyrean was a spiritual god, extremely mysterious and unrivalled. As for an Empyrean’s cultivation methods, abilities, or the limits of their strength, these were also enigmas that far surpassed the comprehension of mortals. If the Ancient Devil within Yang Yun hadn’t taken part in the great war 100,000 years ago and personally saw Empyrean Primordius slay armies with the Primordius martial intent, it would’ve been impossible for him to recognize that Lin Ming was also using the same martial intent.\\n\\n As for Saint Artifact Pavilion artifact spirit, although it had lived for countless tens of thousands of years, it was locked within Phoenix Cry Palace and had no way of coming into contact with a character like Empyrean Primordius. It couldn’t recognize the Primordius martial intent. But even so, it could feel that Lin Ming’s martial intent was terrifying.\\n\\n “This child actually has such a mysterious force field martial intent on him. In addition to his cultivation, age, and solid foundation, his potential is truly terrifying. Moreover, it seems as if he is a martial artist that ascended from the lower realms. From the way he fought just now, he should have completed his dual body and essence cultivation and opened the Eight Inner Hidden Gates. To accomplish this in the lower realms where resources are so lacking is truly incredible!”\\n\\n Saint Artifact Pavilion’s artifact spirit was far more intelligent than the common man. It was able to instantly discern many things. If the nine stages of Life Destruction decided a martial artist’s future boundary, then Lin Ming’s martial intent, Laws, battle spirit, and dual body and essence cultivation played an immense role in deciding his comparative combat strength with other martial artists at his level. Those factors also played a great role in determining a martial artist’s future achievements.\\n\\n “Dual body and essence cultivation, how many years has it been in Phoenix Cry Palace since someone decided to take this route. The body transformation path conflicts with Life Destruction. After body transformation, crossing Life Destruction becomes extremely difficult. As for the Nine Stars of the Dao Palace that follow the Eight Inner Hidden Gates, that is impossible. If one cannot break through the most essential Nine stars of the dao palace, then the effects of the Eight Inner Hidden Gates will be minimized when one reaches the late Divine Lord realm. It can almost be ignored afterward.\\n\\n The artifact spirit thought like this and took a glimmer of interest in Lin Ming. It looked forward to seeing to what degree this junior would grow.\\n\\n “Let me see what boundary your body transformation technique has reached. The second round of the test will be a test of your body transformation!”\\n\\n Saint Artifact Pavilion’s tests were all decided by the artifact spirit. The artifact spirit itself was a martial arts grandmaster. All sorts of tests, including those that looked at Laws, perception, and so forth could be freely utilized by the artifact spirit.\\n\\n Thanks to the long years of accumulation the artifact spirit had developed a near endless variety of testing methods. Many geniuses of Phoenix Hall were tortured by its tests to the brink of despair. As the artifact spirit saw these chosen prides of heaven being pushed into the ground, it was also overjoyed.\\n\\n At this time, Lin Ming actually had no idea that he managed to arouse the interest of this old antiquity that already existed for countless tens of thousands of years. He could only feel the power of fire around him instantly vanish, and the chain of stars that roiled in the skies also disappeared.\\n\\n Lin Ming took a deep breath, secretly thinking to himself, “The first round of the test only looks at the Concept of Fire and yet it is so difficult. I thought that I could rely on just my Concept of Fire to pass the test, but my results were far worse than what I imagined. I had no choice but to use the Concept of Thunder as well as the Heavenly Demon martial intent to break the chain of stars. This top grade saint artifact test that can even sweep the ground with top geniuses of the Divine Realm isn’t easy to pass at all!”\\n\\n Lin Ming muttered. But he didn’t know that he would have passed the first round of tests as long as he was able to withstand it for half an hour. As for breaking the chain of stars, that was simply overdoing everything.\\n\\n As Lin Ming was still in thoughts, the surrounding environment changed again. All of the heaven and earth origin energy was rapidly drained away!\\n\\n All of the true essence in his dantian was locked down; it was unable to be moved at all.\\n\\n “Hmm? What\u0027s going on here?”\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/martial-world/mw-chapter-961","bookId":1508,"book":{"id":1508,"title":"Martial World","description":"In the Divine Realm, countless legends fought over a mysterious cube.
