At this time, the disparity between Lin Ming’s strength and the strength of that terrifying soul couldn’t even be described as a firefly against the full moon! In this moment of life or death, Lin Ming waved the Phoenix Blood Spear. Suddenly, a brilliant gold light blazed from between his eyes as he burned the blood of the Ancient Phoenix! The power of thunder and fire within the Heretical God Seedling flooded out and wrapped around the Phoenix Blood Spear. With a thrust forwards, the power of thunderfire twisted around a blue lotus that hurtled straight towards the ancient soul! The power of thunder was the nemesis of soul forms. Lin Ming pouring the power of thunder into the Blue Lotus Flame Dance was already using his complete strength! He wanted to use the momentum from this attack to run away. After all, this ancient soul might be the existence suppressed underneath the Divine Seal Array. If this were true, then even if it were incomparably powerful, it still had to be restricted by the sealing array formation. There was a chance that he could escape from here! “Mm?” As the ancient soul saw the deep red Prime Emperor Lotus Flower bloom from behind Lin Ming and emit a soft trill, it was faintly surprised. But, this was only a little bit. At this time, the thunderfire-twisted blue lotus spear light was already shooting towards it at incredible speeds. The ancient soul didn’t seem to care at all. With a mere thought, a rustling sound filled the air as its battle spirit surged outwards, overwhelming the world! Like an undefeatable enemy, the battle spirit filled the entire space. The thunderfire blue lotus that Lin Ming shot out was swallowed up by this world of will projection, as if a black hole had formed, swallowed everything! “It vanished!?” Lin Ming’s hands and feet instantly turned ice cold. It wasn’t just his thunderfire blue lotus, but even the grandmist space around it seemed as if it was swallowed up by that world of will projection! This was a power of Laws that he was completely unable to understand. His opponent was only a soul form, but it was actually able to rely on just its battle spirit to achieve such a terrifying combat strength! “Your martial skill is quite good. Is this a force field? The rank is very high!” The old voice echoed out. The ancient soul was obviously referring to the Primordius martial intent’s grandmist space. Although this ancient soul’s experience was amazing, it actually wasn’t able to recognize just where this grandmist space came from. This wasn’t because Lin Ming used a martial skill to conceal the energy fluctuations of the grandmist space, but because Empyrean Primordius was at most born a few dozen million years ago. In other words, this ancient soul had been quietly slumbering here far before Empyrean Primordius had even been born. The ancient soul didn’t know of Empyrean Primordius, thus it also didn’t recognize this grandmist space. “Such a powerful martial skill and yet you can’t use its full strength. What a waste of heaven’s gifts, heh, you might as well give it to me!” The ancient soul sneered. Its world of will projection blocked out all of the surrounding space. Lin Ming could see countless battle spirit tentacles stretching out endlessly like an infinitely large spider web, sealing off all the space for several hundred miles. And Lin Ming was a bug caught in that spider web; it was impossible for him to escape! Lin Ming’s thoughts sank. Was this truly the existence suppressed by this seal? If so, how could it casually display such horrifying supernatural powers? Or, perhaps the seal had already weakened and it was able to use a greater portion of its strength. In this sort of situation, Lin Ming tightly gripped onto the Phoenix Blood Spear, his mind tighter than a steel wire. Facing such a life or death crisis, he had to remain calm at all costs, otherwise he would never find a chance to escape. Lin Ming’s palms were already slick with sweat, but his eyes still remained as calm and placid as before. In all these years growing up and walking down the road of martial arts, he had experienced countless life or death situations. Although this wasn’t the most dangerous one, this opponent was the most powerful he had ever faced! “If you kill me then you’ll never obtain my cultivation methods or martial skills. My body does not have any cultivation method jade slips!” Lin Ming gloomily said. One of the unique aspects of a transcendent divine might was that it was nearly impossible to duplicate. The only way was to obtain a transcendent divine might jade slip, or be like Lin Ming and have the ability to transform another’s soul into pure memories. If one tried this using another method, they would inevitably be influenced by the other’s spirit mark. “Then that’s a pity. But… you will still die here!” The ancient soul’s voice contained a light killing intent. Its world of will protection still enveloped all of the surrounding space, removing any chance of Lin Ming being able to escape. “Senior, may I ask you for a reason why you wish to kill me? I did not mean to offend you, but because I only disturbed your rest you wish to kill me?” Lin Ming was clear that these ancient monsters had extremely eccentric and paranoid personalities. They were reckless and did whatever they desired, and wanting to use reason to persuade them was simply an impossible hope. Moreover, the existence sealed here might be a bloodthirsty and vicious demon to begin with. Still, Lin Ming hoped that he could avoid this battle where his chances of winning approached zero. “That’s right! And what if I do? In order to allow my soul to withstand the endless tides of time, I used the Destruction Sundering Art, meaning that every time I had to awaken, it would cause great harm to my life! In order to not be bothered by pests, I purposefully established this hidden land so that I could rest here. I never imagined that someone like you would be able to find this place. If I let you leave and you spread the news of my slumber here, and also reveal the giant violet sun crystal mountain that exists here, then who knows how many self-serving powerhouses will come here, thinking themselves indestructible because of their greed, or how many so-called geniuses would come thinking their luck and destiny would protect them. Although I don’t fear any of them, my peaceful days would be numbered!” As that ancient soul spoke, there was only a faint humming noise like ghosts and spirits crying and screaming. The space all around began to violently vibrate, and underneath Lin Ming, the ground began to collapse. The massive violet sun crystal mountain trembled as a hazy shadow appeared on it, gradually forming the face of a person. This face was hundreds of feet high and a gray-green color. Its face was expressionless but its eyes were cold and sharp, like a divine god overlooking the world. This was clearly the main form of the ancient soul! Lin Ming sucked in a deep breath. Facing this ancient soul, the pressure he felt was like facing the endless heavens themselves. Was this the soul of an Empyrean? With things having devolved to this point, Lin Ming knew that any promise he made to keep what he learnt a secret would be just a joke. Fighting was inevitable! At this time, a voice suddenly resounded in his mind. It was Mo Eversnow’s true essence sound transmission. “Lin Ming, it’s clear that the only path we have left is to fight. If… if I fall into a deep sleep once more, you’ll have to rely on yourself from now on.” “Miss Mo!” Lin Ming anxious said, startled. “There is no need for needless words! If I fall into a deep sleep again then there will always remain the chance that you can awaken me once more, and perhaps one day when you are stronger you can even reform my mortal body. But if you were to die here, everything we’ve done so far would come to nothing!” As Mo Eversnow spoke, her soul force began to penetrate into Lin Ming’s spiritual sea. She wasn’t attempting to seize his body, but was trying to fuse with his soul for a short duration and wield dual control of Lin Ming’s body. Like this, the two of them could display their strongest combat strength. After Lin Ming crossed heavenly tribulation, his combat strength could not be underestimated. At this time, there was a whistling sound as a brilliant light flashed and an incomparably keen sword shot out from between the ancient soul’s eyebrows. This sword was forged by both soul force and battle spirit. As it appeared, it sliced apart the Divine Realm space! Lin Ming’s pupils shrank. In this face of this peerless power, he and Mo Eversnow both poured their complete soul and will into the Magic Cube! “Awaken, Magic Cube, lend me your strength!” Mo Eversnow’s cold and clear voice echoed out as she began to burn her soul force. Of everything Lin Ming had, the only thing with the strength to resist this ancient soul was the Magic Cube! The Magic Cube was a divine instrument of the soul, and this ancient existence was also a soul form. This was the only reason why Mo Eversnow had a faint hope that they could defeat this great enemy. With Lin Ming’s current strength, it was still far from enough for being able to galvanize the Magic Cube. To Lin Ming, the Magic Cube was only a soul treasure that passively defended him. It could only remain defensive and not attack. The exception was if a situation occurred like before, when he had fought Yang Yun at the Temple of Marvels. At that time, the Ancient Devil’s soul had rushed into Lin Ming’s spiritual sea and wanted to seize his body. But, because of the passive defensive powers of the Magic Cube, the Ancient Devil had suffered serious damage to its soul. This was the only way that this ancient soul could be defeated. Otherwise, this ancient soul would branch off a tiny portion of its soul and will to attack Lin Ming. Lin Ming could rely on the Magic Cube to defend, but it was impossible for him to harm his opponent; at most he would swallow up the tiny portion of soul that attacked him. In order to defeat this ancient soul, the only method was to drive the Magic Cube to attack on its own initiative. But with Mo Eversnow’s current condition, the price for this would be tremendous! There would only be a single chance! Hum- Hum- Hum- The Magic Cube slumbering within Lin Ming’s spiritual sea began to rapidly spin, forming an ash gray soul storm. After this soul storm was formed, it grew increasingly intense, like a black hole that would swallow all of existence. Kacha! With a harsh cracking sound, the sword of soul and will that the ancient soul sent out chopped down onto that black hole formed by the Magic Cube. Then, it suddenly disappeared without the slightest hint that it ever existed! As the ancient soul saw this, its expression suddenly changed. “This aura, could it be… just how…” The tiny soul force that was swallowed up by the Magic Cube had completely disappeared, but the ancient soul was clearly unharmed. It was clear that this wisp of soul was a less than insignificant loss. It narrowed its eyes, carefully sensing just where its soul wisp had gone to. Finally, it discovered that after its soul wisp had been parted from its body, even the spirit mark contained within it was completely erased. This sort of feeling was like its soul wisp had fallen into a true black hole and was isolated in a completely different space-time. “It’s really that object! You have that thing on your body!?” The ancient soul said, suddenly excited. Its originally emotionless face began to experience all sorts of changes. Lin Ming’s mind shook as he heard this. Without a doubt, the object that this ancient soul referred to was the Magic Cube! Magic Cube! This was Lin Ming’s first time hearing that anyone knew of the Magic Cube beyond the Verdant Feather Holy Lands! He went on full alert. If this ancient soul knew of the Magic Cube, then it naturally knew of the Magic Cube’s value too. There was a chance that it would compete for it with everything it had! Lin Ming gathered his strength, preparing for an all-out strike. Then, at this time, the ancient voice suddenly said, “Alright, alright, consider this over. If you stop now then the damage won’t be too great on you. Otherwise, if you use this treasure with your strength then even you might end up as a sacrifice!” Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/martial-world/mw-chapter-1149","bookId":1508,"book":{"id":1508,"title":"Martial World","description":"In the Divine Realm, countless legends fought over a mysterious cube.
