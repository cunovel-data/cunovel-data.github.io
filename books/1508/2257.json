The attacks from the Demon God’s Tomb Master were as accurate as a calendar, appearing once every 2000 years.\\n\\n The martial artists of the 33 Heavens knew that when Lin Ming entered his second seclusion, he had said to them that this seclusion would last for about 10,000 years.\\n\\n It could be expected that in these 10,000 years, the Demon God’s Tomb Master’s attacks would continue to descend upon them.\\n\\n Moreover, it seemed that every attack was stronger than the last. Perhaps when the end of the 10,000 years appeared, the might of the Demon God’s Tomb Master’s attacks would reach new heights!\\n\\n Just what would that scene be like? The martial artists of the 33 Heavens didn’t dare to imagine.\\n\\n And at the 8000 year period, the fifth continuous attack arrived as expected!\\n\\n Hum - !\\n\\n The dark night of the Asura Road was illuminated with bright light, making it seem as if it were daytime. A blood red glow basked the entire world!\\n\\n The heavens and earth were pierced through. It was like a peerless vicious beast was awakening within this divine light.\\n\\n It was like a sun that was billions of miles wide fell into the Asura Sea. The powerful shockwaves shoved apart the Asura Sea to unimaginable depths, revealing the rocky seabed!\\n\\n The Divine Seal Altar was struck flying away and the protective array formations around the Amethyst Heavenly Palace were torn apart by divine light. The entire Amethyst Heavenly Palace began to wildly rock in the violent tsunamis!\\n\\n “Lin Ming!”\\n\\n 10,000 miles away, Divine Dream, Xiao Moxian, Lin Huang, and the others all saw this strike and felt their hearts tighten!\\n\\n Facing the strength of the Demon God’s Tomb Master, all of them were simply incapable of resisting. If they were drawn into these shockwaves they would be heavily wounded or even killed.\\n\\n In these past years, the martial artists of the 33 Heavens had progressed a great deal. But when compared to the Demon God’s Tomb Master, it was simply unworthy of mention.\\n\\n “Father!”\\n\\n Lin Huang gripped his fists, his nails digging into his flesh and blood. Facing this calamity he was far too weak, but in truth his cultivation was actually at the peak of the martial artists of the 33 Heavens.\\n\\n From the time that Lin Ming went into seclusion, coupled with the time enchantment, the martial artists of the 33 Heavens had practiced for over 50,000 years. But Lin Huang had trained for an even longer period of time; he had been continuously cultivating for 70,000 years already.\\n\\n In these 70,000 years, Lin Huang frequently fought with the masters of the 33 Heavens. At the start he fought with older Empyrean masters like Skyrend Godlord and then started fighting those like Astral Vault God King. After that he fought with Soaring Feather God King and Emperor Shakya. After Jiu’er grew up, he even fought with her. Finally, Lin Huang even trained with Empyrean Divine Dream.\\n\\n Lin Huang’s cultivation had already reached the middle True Divinity realm.\\n\\n Not just him, but Xiao Moxian, Soaring Feather God King, and Emperor Shakya also broke into the middle True Divinity realm. Dragon Fang, Jun Bluemoon, Hang Chi, Fairy Blue Lotus, Dark Demon Monarch, as well as the primal god race’s Diwuhen, Lan Xin, and the celestial race’s To Bagui, and many others also broke into the lower True Divinity realm.\\n\\n Because the Asura Road had released all the resources it had accumulated for 10 billion years and also because the various ancient influences of the three great races had unconditionally opened all of their inheritances, the strength of the martial artists of the 33 Heavens had reached an unprecedented peak that hadn’t been achieved since 10 billion years ago.\\n\\n But in front of the Demon God’s Tomb Master, all of this was useless…\\n\\n The disparity was simply too great.\\n\\n Rumble rumble rumble!\\n\\n Shockwaves from the world-destroying light flew into the horizon and the massive sea waves began to fall back down. The martial artists of the 33 Heavens looked at the weakened array formation around the Amethyst Heavenly Palace and felt their hearts shiver.\\n\\n It had been a long time since they gathered near the Amethyst Heavenly Palace to cultivate. With Ink and Clear’s management, they had formed a new time enchantment that was a good distance away from the Amethyst Heavenly Palace. This was a relatively safer place to cultivate.\\n\\n After all, Empyrean martial artists and those below an Empyrean couldn’t withstand such terrifying shockwaves.\\n\\n Lin Ming’s seclusion had yet to end. After 2000 more years, another horrifying attack was likely to arrive…\\n\\n What would that be like? No one dared to imagine that scenario.\\n\\n Time passed, year after year. The martial artists of the 33 Heavens desperately cultivated with all their hearts. They felt a foreboding premonition that a great storm was coming, and this final moment would also be the last war that decided the fate of the 33 Heavens.\\n\\n Even though those that gathered in the Asura Sea were the unparalleled overlords of their various races, they still felt a deep and sincere fear!\\n\\n What would come would eventually come; it was impossible to hide from.\\n\\n Moreover, everything that occurred would happen earlier than expected.\\n\\n 10,000 years hadn’t yet passed. On the 9900th year, the Demon God’s Tomb Master’s sixth attack arrived without warning!\\n\\n The titanic beam of divine light seemed to fall down from the river of stars in the highest heavens. It broke through the skies of the Asura Road, drowning out the dazzling sun in the skies. All that was left over was the blinding fiery divine light that covered all.\\n\\n The entire Asura Road began to burn!\\n\\n On the long and linear Asura Road, the Asura Sea was located at the very terminal end of this strip. But beneath the divine light that seemed to fall like a river of stars, the end of the Asura Road where the Asura Sea was located was forcibly cut apart!\\n\\n Destructive light swallowed everything and all sounds disappeared from the world. 100,000 miles away, the martial artists of the 33 Heavens stared helplessly on as the Asura Road was torn apart. The endless seawater no longer exploded in giant tsunamis but was instead sucked into the void where it vanished from sight!\\n\\n And the Amethyst Heavenly Palace was also enveloped in this divine light. Its protective array formations resisted for only a brief moment before breaking apart!\\n\\n The light of the array formations shot outward. Without the protection of the array formations, the entire Amethyst Heavenly Palace was forced to withstand the direct impact of this divine light!\\n\\n “Lin Ming!”\\n\\n “Human Sovereign Your Majesty!”\\n\\n Many martial artists of the 33 Heavens were so worried that they started to rush over. Lin Ming was their final hope, but if he were to be directly struck by this divine light while in seclusion, would he simply disintegrate to nothing?\\n\\n The energy of the divine light was too strong. Even the Amethyst Heavenly Palace that was carefully refined by the Asura Road Master was mostly melted away!\\n\\n Within the Amethyst Heavenly Palace, Lin Ming bled from all over his head. And, this blood was not red but black; just as his blood flowed out it was charred by the horrifying flows of heat.\\n\\n His road of fusing heaven and man had reached its final moments. But at this last step, the Demon God’s Tomb Master was doing his best to not allow Lin Ming to walk to the end of this road!\\n\\n “Senior… Senior Asura!”\\n\\n Lin Ming cried out to the Asura Road Master in his heart. He knew that in this strike just now, it was the Asura Road Master that had helped him keep off the majority of it, otherwise he would have already perished!\\n\\n The Asura Road Master had consumed an enormous amount of energy in these years. His body grew increasingly weak and he was even now forced to help block this strike. How could Lin Ming not be worried?\\n\\n “Senior Asura… you…”\\n\\n “Do not divert your heart… I… should still have some energy left remaining…” Within the darkness, the Asura Road Master’s voice echoed out; it was already incomparably weak.\\n\\n Hearing this voice, Lin Ming felt his heart shiver. He clearly felt that that the strike just now had wounded the Asura Road Master’s source of life.\\n\\n “Senior Asura…”\\n\\n Lin Ming was at a loss for words. Anything he said right now would be useless and pale. But at this time, he could feel a terrifying divine might surging in the skies above. Lin Ming’s face blanched; the attack hadn’t ended!\\n\\n This time, the Demon God’s Tomb Master didn’t attack just once, but twice!\\n\\n “That old freak… he’s going all out…”\\n\\n The Asura Road Master’s voice was frail and powerless. His figure moved around in the darkness. 10,000 years ago he had appeared young and filled with great vigor and majesty, but now he had a head of white hair and his appearance was wrinkled and withered, like an old man on the verge of death.\\n\\n Although his body was old, the Asura Road Master’s eyes still remained as bright and pure as a spring lake. He clearly realized that Lin Ming was in the final moments of his seclusion. The Demon God’s Tomb Master was doing everything in his power to stop this and destroy Lin Ming!\\n\\n “Damn it all… if only I had another month, no… 20 days, if I only had 20 days…”\\n\\n Lin Ming clenched his fists together, his eyes turning blood red with rage. His nails dug deep into the flesh of his palm. He could already speculate what had happened. When the Soul Emperor lay hidden in the Soul World for all those past years, although he hadn’t been able to do anything to the Akashic Dream Universe, he had still managed to leave behind some contingencies within. The Soul Emperor could likely sense what he was doing and also feel that he was in the final stages of his fusion of heaven and man!\\n\\n In 9900 years, Lin Ming had already accelerated his speed of refinement. This was to avoid the Demon God’s Tomb Master’s desperate counterattack. But, he had still misjudged. The Demon God’s Tomb Master’s final attack had also come earlier, just a month before his seclusion was due to come to an end.\\n\\n It was impossible that this was a coincidence. The only possible reason was that the Demon God’s Tomb Master had managed to somehow probe his situation using some methods.\\n\\n The energy brewing in the skies grew increasingly strong. Around the already shattered Amethyst Heavenly Palace, the martial artists of the 33 Heavens that were rushing forwards were panic-stricken; they all revolved their movement techniques and began drawing backwards.\\n\\n It was impossible for them to share the burden of this attack with Lin Ming; it was too terrifying.\\n\\n “It’s weakened by over half… that old demon doesn’t have much excess strength remaining…”\\n\\n In the shattered amethyst hall, the Asura Road Master looked up into the skies. To forcibly send out a second attack, this was surely an enormous burden to the Demon God’s Tomb Master who was still in seclusion!\\n\\n When a martial artist was in seclusion, the ultimate taboo was for their training to be interrupted. Even though the Demon God’s Tomb Master had transcendent methods, he would still be restricted in his actions.\\n\\n As the second attack came crashing down, the Asura Road Master’s body turned into a flow of light that fused into the shattered Amethyst Heavenly Palace around him, propping up one final shield!\\n\\n “Ahhh!”\\n\\n Outside the Amethyst Heavenly Palace, many martial artists cried out in alarm. They watched blankly on as the broken Amethyst Heavenly Palace completely blew apart underneath the conflagration of divine light.\\n\\n The fragments of the Amethyst Heavenly Palace mixed in with the storm and scattered in all directions.\\n\\n “Lin Ming!”\\n\\n “No - !”\\n\\n Xiao Moxian looked at this occur from a distance, feeling like her heart had been stabbed by a saber!\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/martial-world/mw-chapter-2237","bookId":1508,"book":{"id":1508,"title":"Martial World","description":"In the Divine Realm, countless legends fought over a mysterious cube.
