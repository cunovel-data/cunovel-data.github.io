You’re hungry?” Lin Ming brightly smiled. Hunger meant that she was much better.\n Qin Xingxuan nodded, a bit embarrassed. She was hungry and she was also thirsty.\n “I’ll cook up something delicious for you, I guarantee you’ll like it.”\n After Lin Ming spoke, he lit a fire and took out some pots; he had always brought along cooking utensils in his spatial ring.\n He placed a giant pot on the fire and added water. Then, Lin Ming took out a great piece of bright red meat from his spatial ring and tossed it in the pot.\n He sprinkled on some salt and spices, and then covered the pot to let it boil.\n After a quarter of an hour, a delicious mouthwatering fragrance began to drift out. Lin Ming slowly handed Qin Xingxuan a big bowl. The soft and red meat glittered, and the rich soup was a pale red. It looked like a vintage wine, and also extremely tasty.\n After a sprinkle of diced green onions and a dash of cooking wine, not even an immortal could find anything better.\n “What is this?”\n Qin Xingxuan asked in awe as she looked at delicious-seeming bowl of red and green soup.\n Lin Ming smiled but didn’t say anything. This was food that he had brought back from the Divine Phoenix Mystic realm, and was also the meat from those strange giant crabs. The river underneath the cave was very long, so Lin Ming was impolite and took some time to go hunting for a giant heap of those strange crabs. He had even taken a great amount of the river water.\n These two things were absolutely the best spiritual food and water. Within the Sky Spill Continent, there was nearly no place where something this great could be found. Lin Ming’s spatial ring wasn’t big enough, but Lei Mubai’s was. His low-grade earth-step spatial ring had over a hundred square feet of space inside. So, Lin Ming had packed it full of crab meat. The space inside a spatial ring was a separate dimension; food placed within would never spoil, and it had an effect of always maintaining freshness. It would be alright even if food was stored within for hundreds of years.\n After Qin Xingxuan drank the soup, she also had some crab meat. Qin Xingxuan looked surprised. The crab meat was soft and tender, yet full of strength. The soup was also extremely savory. Not only that, but once the crabmeat entered her stomach, it turned into a gentle flow of heat that slowly dissipated, spreading throughout her body and nourishing her true essence, making her feel warm. After drinking and eating this food, she felt completely comfortable.\n “What is this? Is it expensive?”\n When Qin Xingxuan was at the Seven Profound Valleys, she had also eaten spiritual food. Top quality spiritual food might even cost hundreds of true essence stones. But compared to this crab meat, that spiritual food was nothing. Could the cost of this crab meat be factored by thousands of true essence stones?\n Lin Ming said, “It’s great as long as you eat it. These are all things that I obtained in the Divine Phoenix Mystic Realm, they can help you recuperate from your wounds.”\n With 10 drops of Vermillion Bird blood essence as medicine and then supported by the highest quality spirit food to assist in recovery, such an extravagant method of treatment was enough to make up for all the blood essence that Qin Xingxuan had lost.\n Qin Xingxuan’s eyes widened, “Lin Ming, what have you been doing for this last year? What happened to you in the Divine Phoenix Mystic Realm that you had to stay away for such a long time?”\n “It’s a long story. Wait for me and I’ll tell you slowly. That’s right, how well have you practiced the ‘True Primal Chaos Formula’ that I gave you?”\n Qin Xingxuan said, “I’ve only practiced the first layer to the Large Success stage. I encountered many questions, the jade slip explanations aren’t too clear.”\n The ‘True Primal Chaos Formula’ jade slip that Qin Xingxuan had was recorded by Lin Ming and given to her.\n It was not a simple or easy task to record a cultivation method onto a jade slip. There were many mysterious and profound principles involves. If one wished to engrave a cultivation method onto a jade slip, they had to be incomparably proficient at it. At least, they should have almost reached Perfection.\n Someone who didn’t completely understand the ‘True Primal Chaos Formula’ wouldn’t be able to engrave it onto a jade slip, but even if they were given a complete copy of the ‘True Primal Chaos Formula’, it would be impossible for them to duplicate it. It was just like a person who didn’t understand how to carve seals. If someone were to place a seal in front of them and told them to copy it, they wouldn’t be able to create a seal that was entirely alike.\n This was also the reason that cultivation method jade slips were so rare and precious.\n Lin Ming himself had only practiced the ‘True Primal Chaos Formula’ to Largess Success of the third layer. This led to there being many ambiguities and omissions in the jade slip that he created. This was also the reason that Qin Xingxuan found it difficult to proceed, with problems everywhere she looked.\n Not just that, but more importantly, Qin Xingxuan didn’t have the memories of the Realm of the Gods’ Supreme Elder within her mind and the cultivation experience that came with it. Thus, even with her sixth-grade talent, her cultivation speed was very slow.\n Lin Ming sighed. Qin Xingxuan had now reached the Pulse Condensation period. If she wanted to complete the ‘True Primal Chaos Formula’ and then subsequently practice the ‘Chaotic Virtues Combat Meridians’ and walk down the road of Tempering Marrow, that would simply be too difficult.\n So, she might as well start practicing the ‘Vermillion Bird Forbidden Divine Chronicle’. 10 drops of Vermillion Bird blood essence was enough for Qin Xingxuan to cultivate the hardest and most difficult core sections of the ‘Vermillion Bird Forbidden Divine Chronicle’. In fact, it was highly possible that she would even be able to practice the additional three layers of the ‘Vermillion Bird Forbidden Divine Chronicle’ that he had obtained from the Divine Phoenix Mystic Realm.\n Thinking this, Lin Ming asked her, “Xingxuan, are you willing to join Divine Phoenix Island?”\n Qin Xingxuan was stunned by this question. Then, her eyes shined. “Join Divine Phoenix Island? Can I?”\n Divine Phoenix Island was a top fourth-grade sect. With her sixth-grade talent, she was a once-in-a-generation talent within Sky Fortune Kingdom. Within the Seven Profound Valleys, her talent was also good. But if she were placed in Divine Phoenix Island, her talent was only ordinary. For instance, Mu Qianyu and Mu Bingyun were both superior seventh-grade talents. As for Qin Xingxuan, she was only a medium sixth-grade. Within Divine Phoenix Islands, most of the maids there were at least inferior sixth-grade talents.\n Of course, Qin Xingxuan also desired to join Divine Phoenix Island. In terms of cultivation resources, the difference between the Seven Profound Valleys and Divine Phoenix Island was like night and day. And the most important factor was that Lin Ming was also at Divine Phoenix Island.\n If she could go to Divine Phoenix Island, that meant she could be closer to Lin Ming.\n Lin Ming smiled. “If you are willing, then of course you can! This time I’ll take you to Divine Phoenix Island. There is no longer any need for you to stay at the Seven Profound Valleys!”\n The Seven Profound Valleys was a very complex environment. Lin Ming had far more enemies than friends. If Qin Xingxuan stayed there, Lin Ming would not be able to pass his days in peace.\n That evening, Lin Ming lay down next to Qin Xingxuan. They kept their clothes on, and held hands. Lin Ming happily reiterated his experience this past year to Qin Xingxuan. The conversation of these two continued throughout the entire night, as they gazed into each other’s eyes. Without either of them sleeping, they were still speaking until the dawn arrived…\n ………….\n Next day, early in the morning, Lin Ming took Xingxuan’s hand and led her out of the cave. In the distance, they could hear the faint sounds of zithers playing. This was Qin Ziya and Qin Yao discussing zither music theory.\n As Qin Yao saw Qin Xingxuan leave the cave, she let out a breath of relief. Although she already realized that nothing would happen to Qin Xingxuan, it wasn’t until she saw her friend truly awaken that her heart rose back up from her stomach.\n “Junior-apprentice Sister Qin, you’ve awoken!” Qin Yao grasped Qin Xingxuan’s hands, a cheerful smile on her face. Qin Xingxuan’s face unconsciously flushed red, as if she had been caught doing something naughty.\n Towards Qin Xingxuan, Qin Yao felt a bit of sisterly envy. Lin Ming had flown hundreds of thousands of miles non-stop in order to rescue Qin Xingxuan. What girl didn’t dream that the one they loved would rescue them in such a daring manner, a dashing knight that radiating a glorious momentum?\n Not just that, but Lin Ming was extremely handsome, and his future was limitless.\n Originally, Qin Yao didn’t envy Qin Xingxuan; there simply wasn’t anything to be envious of. But now she did. The two bottles of pills that Lin Ming had given her were enough for her to step into the Xiantian realm. As for whatever he could give Qin Xingxuan, it was surely enough for her to step into the Revolve Core realm.\n The Revolving Core realm! It was also the realm of the Highest Elder. One would also have 500 to 600 years of life. Thinking this, Qin Yao sighed. Her Junior-apprentice Sister Qin was really lucky!\n At this moment, a flame suddenly lit in front of Qin Ziya. This was a sound transmitting talisman. As Qin Ziya heard the message from the sound transmitting talisman, he frowned, and then he sneered.\n “Mm? What’s going on?”\n Qin Ziya said, “It is a Seven Profound Command to summon me back. Ouyang Boyan has accused me of being derelict in my duties and defying military orders, saying that not only did I secretly leave Star Coconut Island which was under my supervision, but also that I injured his disciple and stole away the sea map. This time, Ouyang Boyan is preparing to impeach me in front of the Council of Elders.”\n Lin Ming smiled, but his smile was very cold. It contained a thick, deadly, murderous intent.\n “Well since that’s the case, Martial House Master Qin, let us return to the sect. I’ll go back together with you and have a look at just how they will impeach you!”\n \n \n \n \n \n Previous Chapter Next Chapter","sourceLink":"https://www.wuxiaworld.com/novel/martial-world/mw-chapter-417","bookId":1508,"book":{"id":1508,"title":"Martial World","description":"In the Divine Realm, countless legends fought over a mysterious cube.
