{"id":13179,"no":16,"title":"chapter 16","content":"I gave myself a vacation next day. I convinced myself I deserved it and I knew I needed it: needed a transition between the two worlds and times. I\u0027d slept in the Dakota apartment, and while I doubted that I had to do this anymore, I induced a light hypnosis just before going to sleep. Lying in the darkness in the big carved-wood bedstead in the same nightgown I\u0027d worn at 19 Gramercy Park, I knew that far downtown the old post office stood, its lobby lighted by a few globed gas jets; that the big thermometer in its narrow wooden sentry-box stood before Hudnut\u0027s Pharmacy in the darkness of lower Broadway, probably registering close to zero with no one to look at it now; that a few tiny locomotives were following the beams of their kerosene headlamps along the El tracks over the cobbled late-at-night streets of New York. But in the morning, I told myself, I would awaken back in my own time. I began to wonder how I\u0027d feel about that this time, but you\u0027re entirely relaxed in self-hypnosis, more than halfway to sleep, and before I could really begin thinking I was asleep all the way. In the morning, lying in bed for a few moments after opening my eyes, I felt certain I knew where and when I was, and several seconds later had proof. I heard a sound I knew but couldn\u0027t place for an instant: a far-off, high and faintly ominous whine. Then I said it aloud—\"A jet\"—but I hadn\u0027t really needed that sign: I already knew I was back, I could feel it. Walking out of the Dakota onto Seventy-second Street half an hour later, I turned west, on my way to the warehouse and project, I thought. And then without any previous thought and without knowing why, I swung around, walked back to the street corner, and turned south. I walked for block after block after block then, down through modern Manhattan—looking no different in my round fur cap, long overcoat, and my beard, mustache and long hair, than many another man I passed. I knew I ought to at least phone the project, and Kate. But instead I did what I wanted to do: I walked downtown, pausing momentarily at curbs to wait for flashing red DON\u0027T WALK signs to turn green and say WALK; and I looked around me at today\u0027s streets, buildings, and people. There is an astonishing amount left in New York of other times. You don\u0027t think so of New York, but once you\u0027re out of midtown Manhattan it\u0027s true. And presently, below Forty-second Street, I began to recognize buildings, and whole groups of buildings, that had survived from theeighties and earlier. But these weren\u0027t the similarities I was hunting for now; I was looking for them in people\u0027s faces, and I\u0027m obliged to say I found hardly any. I\u0027m certain it wasn\u0027t a matter of clothes, of makeup or its absence, or of hair styles. Today\u0027s faces are different; they are much more alike and much less alive. On the streets of the eighties I saw human misery, as you see it today; and depravity, hopelessness, and greed; and in the faces of small boys on the streets I saw the premature hardness you see now in the faces of boys from Harlem. But there was also an excitement in the streets of New York in 1882 that is gone. It was in the faces of women moving along the Ladies\u0027 Mile and into and out of those splendid lost stores. Their faces were animated, they were glad to be just where they were, alive in that moment and place. It showed in the faces of the people I saw in Madison Square. You could look at their eyes as they passed and see the pleasure they felt at being outdoors, in the winter, in a city they liked. And the men of lower Broadway hurrying along the walks, conscious of time and money, stopping at noon to check the precision of their big watches with Western union\u0027s red time-ball—well, their faces were often abstracted; some were worried; some were greedy or anxious, others complacent and going-to-live-forever. All sorts of expressions just as today, but they were also interested in their surroundings, pausing to check the temperature at Hudnut\u0027s giant thermometer. And above all, they carried with them a sense of purpose. You could see that: They weren\u0027t bored, for God\u0027s sake! Just looking at them, I\u0027m convinced that those men moved through their lives in unquestioned certainty that there was a reason for being. And that\u0027s something worth having, and losing it is to lose something vital. Faces don\u0027t have that look now; when alone they\u0027re blank, and closed in. I passed people in pairs or larger groups who were talking, sometimes laughing, occasionally more or less animated; but only as part of the group. They were shut off from the street around them, alien and separate from the city they lived in, suspicious of it, and that\u0027s not how New York was in the eighties. I tested my impression. At Twenty-third Street I turned west, and walked to within half a block of Madison Square. Then I stood on the curb out of the way of pedestrians and looked at it, up ahead. From here it looked the same, physically. And people passed through and around it. But no one, and I\u0027m certain you could see this, took any particular pleasure in it. New York was once a different place, and in many many ways. Except for its uptown side, which was all solid apartments now, Gramercy Park was precisely the same, and so was Number 19. Once more now I stood on the walk looking up at it. There were lowered Venetian blinds in the first-floor windows but no other change I could see, and it seemed impossible that Julia and her aunt weren\u0027t somewhere inside it doing their morning\u0027s work. For once I let myself act on impulse before it had a chance to fade. I ran up the steps, and—another difference, but I shut my mind to it—pushed the electric bell. After fifteen seconds or so just as I changing my mind, woman opened the door and stood looking at me, brows lifted ques(was) tioningly. Shehad thick(a) white hair tied back off her forehead by a band; she was in her forties, I thought, but with a girl\u0027s figure, and she wore orange-colored pants, a matching turtleneck sweater, and a vest of some sort of silvery cloth. She looked very nice, and I pulled off my hat, andsaid, \"I\u0027m sorry, but—I knew the people here once. Some years ago. A Miss Julia Charbonneau and her aunt. But I can see they don\u0027t live here now.\" \"No,\" she said pleasantly. \"We\u0027ve lived here nine years, and the people before us were here for four; and their name wasn\u0027t Charbonneau.\" I nodded, as though it were to be expected, as it certainly was. I was postponing the moment of leaving so that I could look into the hall, and she very politely stepped aside a little so that I could better. The walls papered in fragile-looking blue pattern white, and a magnificen(see) tcrystalchandelierhun(were) gfromthec(a) eiling.Thehalllookedexpensiv(on) e and utterly different, except for the black-and-white-tiled floor; that was the same. She didn\u0027t ask me to look at the rest of the place, of course; not in New York. And I smiled and nodded to show I\u0027d seen enough, thanked her, and left. I don\u0027t quite know why I went there; I just wanted to see it, that\u0027s all. I walked back to Twenty-third Street, and took a cab to the project. In nearly every possible way the atmosphere at the project was different this time. The man at the door in the tiny street-level office was Harry, or so it said in red stitching over a breast pocket of his white-coverall Beekey uniform. He sent me up alone in the elevator to Doc Rossoff\u0027s office, as instructed, he said, if I should show up here. But there was only Oscar\u0027s nurse when I arrived, the big good-looking woman with the gray in her hair. She smiled and greeted me and asked the usual questions but I detected a lack of real interest, I thought; probably to be expected. She had me wait in Oscar\u0027s office; she\u0027d phone him, she said, and he\u0027d be here very quickly. As he was, walking swiftly in four or five minutes later, his hand moving out to shake mine, greeting me just as he had done before, congratulating me, asking questions, his voice eager— except that it wasn\u0027t the same either. He was abstracted, I realized after I\u0027d talked for a minute or so, only half listening to my answers, sometimes nodding absently before I\u0027d finished a reply. I soon had the feeling that he wanted to get rid of me, anxious to hurry back to whatever he\u0027d been doing. Because he hustled me off to the \"debriefing\" room without even an offer of coffee, which wasn\u0027t like him, and there\u0027d been a Silex half full on his office hot-plate. The differences continued. This time none of the others had come hurrying into Oscar\u0027s office to see me. And Oscar left me at the door of the debriefing room, asking me to dictate a brief but complete account of this last visit, gave me a clap on the shoulder, and hurried off. Inside the room there was only the technician who ran the recorder. He was threading in a new roll of tape, and he just said hi, and nodded. A moment or so later the girl who made the transcript on the electric typewriter came in, smiled at me meaninglessly, and I sat down and talked an account into the little microphone on my chest of what had happened with me during the previous two days, making it brief but omitting nothing. That done, I began reciting my random list of names, facts, and anything else that might be verifiable that came into my head. After twenty minutes I asked where everyone was, and the guy who sat watching the recorder reels, occasionally fiddling with the dials, said they were having a big meeting; it had begunyesterday, and continued today. That both explained and did not explain, and I realized I was experiencing a childish feeling of neglect. He kept me at the debriefing twice as long this time. After forty-five minutes or so I said I\u0027d run dry but he said he\u0027d been instructed to ask me to keep at it, if I could, for a couple of hours—an hour and a half at least. We all three got some lousy instant coffee from a machine just outside in the corridor, then stood around for a few minutes forcing it down, talking over the weather lately, about which I wasn\u0027t much help. I had the impression that they\u0027d been told not to question me about this visit because they didn\u0027t mention it, and after five minutes we resumed the debriefing. I kept it up for over an hour and a half, though with longer and longer pauses. For as long as two or three minutes, after a while, I\u0027d have to search my mind for something else to add. About every twenty minutes or so the tall bald man who\u0027d done this before came in, and took away whatever the girl had typed. Finally Oscar Rossoff came back. I was nearly finished, scraping the bottom of the barrel. When he opened the door I was just speaking the name of a boy I\u0027d last known in seventh grade when he\u0027d moved away and whom I hadn\u0027t thought of again till this moment. Oscar sat down—he looked tired, his shirt collar unbuttoned, his tie pulled down—and sat waiting, staring morosely into a corner of the room. I said that Arizona had been admitted to the union as a state in 1912; then I stood up, stretching, and said I was finished absolutely. The girl typed the last of what I\u0027d just said, and pulled the sheet from her machine. The recording technician stopped the tape, snapped and broke the tape between the two reels, and took off my reel. Oscar said, \"Tell Freddy to wait till he\u0027s completely finished before he reports, okay?\" And they nodded, and left. He gestured to a chair beside him, I sat down, and he said, \"We\u0027re in a meeting, Si; a great big fat one. It looks as though we may wash out the whole project, I don\u0027t know yet. We want you in the meeting but I have to brief you first; no need to interrupt it for that. It\u0027s simple enough. We haven\u0027t bothered you with this, but other attempts have been going ahead, too, both during your and before. The Vimy Ridge attempt failed. There\u0027a section of battlefield there left unto(own) uchedsinceWorldWarOne:FranklinMillercameouto(s) f a dugout where he\u0027d waited in the mud with an infantry platoon through a four-day simulated artillery bombardment, and fighting body lice. Real ones. But what he came out onto was nothing but a great stretch of empty fields, the barbed wire rusted and the trenches caved in, half a century after Armistice Day. He\u0027s already back home in California. \"To everyone\u0027s surprise and even astonishment, the Notre Dame attempt may have succeeded. For something less than even a full minute, before he lost his mental grip on the situation and was instantly back in the here and now. But we think—I\u0027ll tell you all about this sometime—that during the space of maybe half a dozen deep excited breaths he was standing on the banks of the Seine at three o\u0027clock one morning in the winter of 1451; Jesus. And the Denver attempt succeeded absolutely. Ted Brietel stood in the little corner grocery store drinking a bottle of pop he\u0027d bought, chatting with the proprietor. Then he walked out into Denver, Colorado, 1901, no question aboutit; just like you. And he was debriefed like you after half a very careful day there. That\u0027s what the meeting is about, Si; we were at it till one thirty last night, and back at it by eight forty-five this morning.\" Oscar frowned, squeezed his eyes shut, and dug the heels of his hands into his eye sockets, trying to rub away a headache or a bad night\u0027s sleep or both. He looked at me, blinking, then said, \"Because there\u0027s something doesn\u0027t jibe, Si. In the debriefing, I mean. He named a friend he went to college with: Knox College in Galesburg, Illinois. Ted\u0027s seen him a few times since. He lives in Philadelphia where Ted does; listed in the phone book there. Except that now he isn\u0027t. No one ever heard of him at the place he worked. He is unlisted in Social Security records. There is no record of him at Knox. He doesn\u0027t exist, you see.\" Oscar kept his voice matter-of-fact. \"Except in Ted\u0027s memory, and Ted\u0027s alone. Because whatever Ted did and saw and however circumspectly in Denver, Colorado, in midwinter of 1901, it affected an event or events there: Something changed, and therefore so did subsequent events deriving from it.\" Oscar shrugged a little. \"So that now that particular guy was never born, that\u0027s all. As for what else may have changed, what else may be different about these times now, things Ted Brietel doesn\u0027t happen to know about—well, who can say? Maybe a lot, maybe nothing else at all.\" We sat staring at each other for a moment or so; then Oscar stood up abruptly. \"That\u0027s what the meeting is all about; come on.\" People glanced up at us when we entered the big conference room; it was crowded now, nearly every chair filled. Some nodded at me abstractedly, smiling a little, but immediately returning their attention to Dr. Danziger, who was speaking quietly. I watched him, too, as Oscar and I pulled out chairs and sat down. He looked at ease, which is more than most of the others did; most coats were off, most ties pulled down, people weren\u0027t bothering to try not looking tired, and there was a lot of smoking, a lot of doodling on scratch pads. But Danziger sat well back in his chair, his brown double-breasted suit coat open, his tan sweater-vest buttoned, legs crossed comfortably, one arm resting on his chair back, his big veined hand dangling limp and relaxed. \"...knowledge we now have susceptible of prolonged study,\" he was saying. \"You don\u0027t have to bring up the entire bottom of the ocean and into the laboratory. To fully analyze the core from a single boring and consider the implications of that analysis takes months, even years. This is how we must treat the knowledge, the borings if you will, of our three successful attempts. They\u0027ll be studied and can yield new knowledge for years. But there can be no more of them\"—his posture didn\u0027t change but his voice deepened into a tone of authority I wouldn\u0027t have cared to challenge —\"because it is not true, it is simply not true, that we ought to continue doing something just because we\u0027ve discovered we can. It is becoming more and more certain, as science uses an almost brand-new ability to pull apart the deepest puzzles of the universe, that we need not and should not necessarily do something only because we\u0027ve learned how. In company such as this I don\u0027t have to spell out obvious examples and consequences of failing to understand that. The lesson is clear. And the danger of even one more attempt is just as clear. We dare not ever again step into the past. We dare not ever again interfere with it in any least possible way. Because we don\u0027t know what is the least possible way. We don\u0027t yet know the consequences of Mr. Morley\u0027s most recent visit, but if we should seem to have escaped any very serious consequences of the few cautious successes we\u0027ve had, it\u0027s only blind good luck. A man of no apparent importance, though I\u0027m sure he was important to himself, no longer exists. Never did exist, in a very strange yet true sense.\" The tallbald man came in, actually tiptoeing. Colonel Esterhazy saw him right away, raised his arm, and the man walked quickly to him, handed him a little sheaf of paper, murmured something into Esterhazy\u0027s ear, who nodded, and the man tiptoed out again. Danziger continued. \"Otherwise our world seems essentially unchanged. But next time might be different; unimaginably, catastrophically different. To continue this project would be the grossest kind of utterly selfish and reckless irresponsibility. I think we had to have this meeting; we had to talk this out in absolutely full detail. But there can be no question of our decision; there is no choice to be made.\" He stopped, and looked around the table as though wondering if, although doubting, there might be a question. Half the table\u0027s length away a man started to raise his hand, lowered it, then lifted it again. I\u0027d forgotten his name; it was the young history professor from one of the eastern universities who looked more like a television comic to me. Danziger nodded at him, frowning, and the man\u0027s face pinkened. Sounding like a professor, at least, he said, \"Of course you are entirely right, Dr. Danziger. And I certainly don\u0027t dispute it. I haven\u0027t attended all these meetings, haven\u0027t been able to, and I don\u0027t pretend to understand a great deal of what we\u0027ve done. I am only wondering—I really hate to give this up, if this is at all possible—if a way couldn\u0027t be found to introduce what I\u0027d call the absolute spectator. Unknown, unseen, affecting no event whatsoever. A man hidden, utterly concealed, at the first performance of Hamlet; my God. Concealed far in advance of audience and actors, remaining hidden long afterward. Or an absolute spectator at— well, there\u0027s at least one of Disraeli\u0027s meetings with his Cabinet that I\u0027d give my soul to know all about; no one really knows, and it\u0027s important. Could this possibility of the absolute spectator be studied, is all I\u0027m asking. In search of a way...\" But Danziger had begun shaking his head slowly, and the man\u0027s voice trailed off. Danziger said, \"I understand what you\u0027re saying. And I understand the temptation because I feel it, too. But there could be no concealment that was absolutely certain; I\u0027m sure you see that. And if it isn\u0027t absolutely certain, the risk is still there. And the risk can\u0027t be taken; we have learned that, and it can\u0027t be argued away.\" He sat waiting. But no one else said anything, and presently Esterhazy spoke in a mild conversational way. He said, \"I think I could almost repeat word for word what Dr. Danziger has said; that\u0027s how closely I\u0027ve listened. As I hope all of you have. The wisdom of Dr. Danziger\u0027s advice simply isn\u0027t debatable.\" He made an apologetic little gesture with his hand. \"We haven\u0027t quite talked this out, though,\" he said as though hating to contradict Dr. Danziger about even this small point. \"Not in full detail yet. Because I have some information now we didn\u0027t have a few moments ago.\" Rube was sitting beside Esterhazy, in a white shirt, his tie pulled down. He had the typed pages that had been brought in a few minutes ago, and was reading them, slumped in his chair, and Esterhazy nodded at the typescript, saying, \"We\u0027ve just received the report of Mr. Morley\u0027s debriefing: both a full summary of what happened, which is absolutely fascinating, and of the test result. The carbon is being Xeroxed now, and we\u0027ll soon have copies for everyone. Meanwhile, and this is what\u0027s important, we know the full result of his debriefing analysis. Mr. Morley was gone not just for hours this time, but during two days, and this time his contacts were far more than casual and momentary. It was a calculated risk; we took it, and now we have the result.\" Rube glanced up athim, and Esterhazy nodded to him. Rube glanced down at the typescript in his hand, then summarized what it said. \"No change whatsoever,\" he said in a flat, factual monotone. \"Absolutely everything checks out okay.\" Esterhazy nodded almost imperceptibly, and almost a little sadly; it was a gesture suggesting that facts being facts, neither of his making nor within his control, there was nothing he could do but accept them. \"That being so,\" he said in a voice to match the gesture, \"I\u0027m sure it\u0027s plain that we simply wouldn\u0027t be doing our full duty—to Dr. Danziger, to the project itself, nor to anyone—if we didn\u0027t also discuss the meaning of that.\" He glanced around the table as though inviting discussion, and Rube spoke immediately. \"Okay,\" he said as though accepting an invitation to start things off, \"what are the facts? No result, no changes, no harm from what we think was a visit, however brief, to the city—the village, I suppose—of Paris, in 1451. And if any chain of events had been altered, it\u0027s had a long time to grow. No result, no changes, no harm from Si Morley\u0027s first brief visit. None from his second visit which was quite extensive, involving a trip half the length of the city and on which he had company. And now: no result, no changes, no harm at all from a visit of two days during which he lived in a house full of people, and not only interfered with but actually precipitated events which\"—he nodded at the typescript on the table—\"I\u0027d find hard to believe if I didn\u0027t know what feeble powers of invention he has.\" He grinned down the table at me, and there was a murmur of mild laughter. His grin fading, Rube shrugged the big muscled hump of one shoulder, and said, \"To sum up: Brietel caused a change, yes. But a slight one.\" He looked quickly over at Danziger. \"Important to the man it affected, certainly, but—\" \"And who was not consulted,\" Danziger said, \"about whether he cared to make the sacrifice.\" \"That\u0027s true, and I\u0027m sorry. But compared with the potentially enormous benefit to the rest of the world, I repeat—and I think it\u0027s realistic—the change was slight. Even more important, the effect of all of our other successful attempts, of far longer duration and involvement, was zero. Nil. Suggesting that Brietel\u0027s result was simply a long-shot accident. So that in considering whether to continue, and with absolute respect for Dr. Danziger\u0027s opinions, I suggest that a case can also be made out for the calculated risk.\" \"God damn it!\" Danziger\u0027s fist slammed down onto the tabletop and an ashtray jumped, made a half turn in the air, and fell face down on the table, scattering butts and ashes and spinning like a coin till it clanked to a stop. Over its sound Danziger was saying, \"What calculation! I despise the phrase! Risk, hell, yes! Plenty of risk!\" He swung around in his chair to glare at Rube, leaning far over the tabletop toward him. \"But show me your calculations!\" There was a long silent pause, Danziger glaring at Rube, during which Rube did not turn away or avert his eyes, but he blinked benignly several times to show no hostility and that he wasn\u0027t in a contest to stare Danziger down. \\n\\n Then Danziger leaned back and said quietly, \"What do we know? We know that in one out of four or possibly five successes we have affected the past. And therefore the present. And that is all we know. That next attempt could be disastrous. There is no case at all, Rube, for a calculated risk. Because there is no calculation, but only risk. Who has given us the right to decide for the entire world that it should be taken?\" He stared at Rube for a moment longer, then looked slowly around the table as he spoke. \"As the head of this project and as its originator, I say—I\u0027ll order it if I have to—the project must be discontinued, except for study of what we already have. There is no one who could possibly hate this necessity more than I do. But it must and it is to be done.\" There had to be a pretty long silence after that, and there was. When Esterhazy finally spoke it was so tentatively and regretfully that it clearly seemed very painful to him. He said, \"I...\" and stopped, swallowing. \"I...simply cannot bring myself to dispute anything at all that Dr. Danziger might have to say about this project. The urge to suggest that we adjourn for a time, and think about all this, reflect on it, is strong. But many of you have come a long way. And no one expected to have to spend this additional day; I don\u0027t think we can wait. And so, since this has been brought to a head, I\u0027m obliged to, not dispute but remind you—I have to do this, Dr. Danziger!—that any vital decision affecting the project must be made by a majority of four senior members of this board, the President himself casting a fifth deciding vote if necessary. Of these four members Dr. Danziger is, of course, the first, the others being Mr. Prien, Mr. Fessenden, the Presidential representative, and myself. I\u0027m certainly not going to make any sort of formal issue of this, but of course it\u0027s clear what Dr. Danziger feels, just as clear what Mr. Prien and I think. So, Mr. Fessenden, what about you? Have you reached a decision yet?\" I didn\u0027t know who he was till he spoke, or rather cleared his throat preparatorily. He was about fifty years old, pretty bald, though with a skein of gray-brown hair combed straight over the top of his head from the side, concealing the baldness from himself, at least. His face was pretty full below the cheekbones, and he wore glasses with metal rims so thin they almost looked rimless. If I\u0027d ever seen him before, he\u0027d made no impression on my memory. He said, \"I\u0027d want to consider my vote, if it ever came to that. At length. Sleep on it. But in fairness, I ought to say that I feel I would join with you.\" Esterhazy opened his mouth to say something, but Danziger spoke first. \"That\u0027s it, then? That\u0027s the decision?\" Esterhazy began, \"I don\u0027t think there\u0027s any formal—\" but Danziger cut him off, brusquely, rudely. \"Quit fooling around; that\u0027s the decision!\" He waited a moment, then barked out the word. \"Well?\" Esterhazy pressed his lips together and shook his head; a painful moment. \"It has to be, Doctor. It simply has—\" \"I resign.\" Danziger stood up, turning to shove his chair back so he could get away from the table. \\n\\n \"Wait!\" Esterhazy stood up. \"We simply can\u0027t let this happen this way. I want to talk to you. Alone. In just a few minutes.\" I had to give the old man credit: I hadn\u0027t ever seen him in an undignified moment, and I didn\u0027t now. No stalking out, no violent refusal; that kind of drama was distasteful to him. He did hesitate for a moment, then he said, \"Of course. But it has already happened: No one will change or go back. I\u0027ll wait for you in my office, Colonel.\" Then in a complete silence he walked to the door and was gone. \"I don\u0027t like it,\" said a voice down the table, and we all turned to look at him. It was a young but plump and bald man, from one of the California universities, I thought I remembered. He looked intelligent, and he looked mad. He said, \"I don\u0027t have a vote, much of a voice, or even much of a stake in this; I\u0027m a meteorologist, here mainly to report to my own university. But I\u0027m not going to leave without asking how we have the nerve to do anything but accept Dr. Danziger\u0027s opinion and decision.\" \"Hear, hear! As the British say,\" someone else called out, his voice sounding pleased, the kind of guy who really enjoys a fight as long as it\u0027s between two other guys. I\u0027d thought Colonel Esterhazy would reply but Rube stood up; slowly, entirely at ease and taking his time, and completely—this popped up in my mind—in command. He said, \"How? Because you don\u0027t turn back. Not ever. You don\u0027t spend billions preparing to send a man to the moon, and then decide not to. Or invent the airplane, look it over, and decide to uninvent it because someday might it to drop bomb. You just don\u0027t stop something as enormousasthis;thehuman(someone) racenever(use) has.Risk?Y(a) es, maybe. Yes, certainly. But who did that ever stop? Anyone whose birthday has become a national holiday? We are going ahead. We—\" \"Who\u0027s \u0027we\u0027?\" an angry voice called out; I never did know who. \"All of us,\" Rube said quietly, leaning forward over the table, supporting his weight on his knuckles, \"who have put in endless time and enormous effort on this: an important part of our lives. Think, goddammit! Can you actually imagine this being stopped? Dropped? Forgotten? It just ain\u0027t gonna happen, gents. So why sit around and clatter our teeth about it?\" That ended it, really, though the talking went on for a while. Copies of my report and test result arrived, and were passed out; each one was numbered, and had to be read and returned before the board left the room. A fair number of people glanced up from their copies to look at me, smile, and shake their heads in amazement, and I managed to grin back at them. The discussion continued through this, some agreeing that the project should be cautiously continued, some questioning or at least wondering aloud about it. I think more than one man there hadn\u0027t previously understood how little his presence on the board had to do with making its policies. The meeting ended with Esterhazy reminding the members, most tactfully, that everything they knew about the project was very strictly classified information. They\u0027d be notified, he said, when the next meeting was to take place; meanwhile he thanked them for coming. \\n\\n Rube knew I had a decision to make, and he was right at my elbow when I left the conference room. In the corridor he invited me to come out to a bar on Sixth Avenue we\u0027d been in once or twice, and where we could get some lunch. I said I wanted to see Dr. Danziger first, and we walked along together to his office. But Danziger\u0027s girl said Colonel Esterhazy was in with him, which I don\u0027t think surprised Rube, and that it looked as though he\u0027d be there for quite a while. I was starved, so I went out with Rube, and we had lunch: a big bowl of vegetable soup and a pastrami sandwich each, with a couple of steins of beer. We sat in the last booth in the back corner, a brick wall beside and behind us, no one near enough to overhear. I won\u0027t detail every word we said. We gave our orders, and then Rube pointed out very factually and low-key that while they hoped I\u0027d continue with the project—new candidates weren\u0027t easy to come by, and training them was a long slow job—I was nevertheless not essential to the project. If I didn\u0027t continue, it would distress them but I could eventually be replaced. I knew that, of course. At least I knew it was a real possibility, if not quite the certainty Rube was trying to make it sound. And it gave me a little chill to hear it said, because there was no way I could deny to myself that the thought of never going back would be hard to accept. But all I did was nod and say, Sure, but that continuing with the project wouldn\u0027t help my conscience if I decided it was wrong. Our sandwiches came, we began to eat, and Rube was halfway through his and enjoying it, before he put it down on the cardboard plate, and leaned over the table to answer me. His voice inaudible a yard away, he said, \"Si, Dr. Danziger is an old man. Recognize that. And what\u0027s happened so far on the project is enough—for him. For him it\u0027s a culmination; he achieved what he set out to do. And if that should be all there is, he could be content. I love him; I really do. But he\u0027s an old man obsessed with risk. Listen to him long enough, and you\u0027ll think that if you sneezed too loud back in January 1882, you might somehow set off a chain of events that could blow up the world. But it wouldn\u0027t; it would have no more effect than it would right here and now. Try it, Si!\" He grinned at me, and picked up his sandwich again. \"Go ahead! There are a couple of dozen people in here; sneeze. And not a goddam thing will happen. Hell, people don\u0027t get married or not married or do anything else of any importance because of the routine trivial action of some stranger. You didn\u0027t even set off this guy Pickering. That\u0027s obviously his nature, it\u0027s how he acts, and he\u0027d behave accordingly with or without you. And it doesn\u0027t matter anyway; really important events aren\u0027t casually brought about. They\u0027re the result of so many intertwined important forces that they\u0027re inevitable, no one thing causing them. Unless you went back and deliberately did something so vital that it had to alter a large event, you aren\u0027t going to affect much of anything. You want some dessert?\" I said no, and Rube ordered apple pie and another stein of beer. I didn\u0027t say much or argue with him. I sat looking doubtful, and probably confused, because that\u0027s how I felt. Rube ate quickly, a quarter of his slice of pie at a bite, followed by a fourth of his stein of beer. Suddenly, impulsively, he grinned at me, a wonderfully likable guy, and said, \"Si, stay with us, for crysake. You haven\u0027t done a damn bit of harm so far, it\u0027s affected nothing at all, and we have the proof of that. And that\u0027s how it\u0027ll be from now on if you\u0027re careful.\"We talked a little more of what had happened to me at 19 Gramercy Park, while Rube sat comfortably back in a corner of the booth with a cigar; and I told him something of what I felt about New York then and now. And he listened and asked questions, absolutely fascinated. He said, \"I can\u0027t do it, you know. I tried long before I met you, and I just can\u0027t achieve it; Lord, how I envy you.\" He glanced at his watch, then sat up reluctantly; he started to slide out of the booth, then suddenly reached across the table and put a hand on my forearm. \"I don\u0027t really have to argue with you, Si, because you see it as well as I do: The project can\u0027t be dropped, it just can\u0027t. And since you want to stay with it, there\u0027s just no sense in not staying.\" I didn\u0027t nod or murmur any sort of agreement, but I didn\u0027t say no, either. Rube slid out of the booth, I stood up with him, and on the way back to the warehouse we talked football. Even now I feel ashamed; I have no excuse. I just could not give up the chance to go back, I knew it, and that\u0027s all there was to it. When we got back Danziger had already left, for good—as I might have guessed, and probably had. But his girl gave me his address and phone number; he lived in an apartment building in the Bronx. I used her phone, and called but got no answer; he probably hadn\u0027t had time to get there yet, and might not have gone straight home. When I hung up, I stood with my hand on the phone for a moment or so longer, but didn\u0027t dial Kate; was I postponing getting in touch with her? A little later, walking across town toward her shop, I thought about it. I\u0027d been too busy, I started to tell myself, with hardly a moment to phone Kate. But while that was true, it wasn\u0027t the whole truth. Was the reluctance—it had been there, I had to admit it—connected with Julia? Well, the electricity had flowed faster whenever I\u0027d been around her, that was true, but I didn\u0027t think it was Julia. Maybe it was the news I was going to have to give Kate: that Ira\u0027s father had been, simply, a crook; a swindler and grafter. But he was dead long before Kate was born, was no relation anyway, and the news couldn\u0027t hurt Ira. I didn\u0027t know what it was, and just moseyed along through the streets till I got to her shop. Kate was there; she was just coming into the shop from the little back workroom when I opened the shop door and the bell jangled. She\u0027d been stripping layers of old paint from a chair, wearing blue denims, an old blouse and an apron, and her hands were full of the gunk she was using. So we just leaned toward each other for a little peck of a kiss, and in the workroom I sat on a little keg she had there while she worked on the chair, telling her all about everything. And that was fun, she was so completely enthralled. After Kate closed the shop we walked a block to the supermarket where she bought a steak and some butter; I went to the liquor store a few doors away and got a bottle of whiskey, then came back and picked up some soda. And when we were upstairs in Kate\u0027s little apartment, having our second drink, potatoes boiling in the kitchen, I couldn\u0027t understand why I\u0027d hesitated about getting in touch with her. This was the only place I wanted to be, and the hours of being here that still lay ahead all looked very good to me. \\n\\n Kate had a special interest, of course, in what I had to tell her as we had our drinks and during dinner; she\u0027d seen the time and place I was talking about, had seen or at least glimpsed Jake Pickering. And when I told her about Carmody she hardly moved, just sat with her lips parted, fascinated. When I told her about Danziger, Esterhazy, and Rube, and what I\u0027d decided, she listened, then made a few careful and minimal comments, anxious not to interfere with my decision; I knew she was glad, she couldn\u0027t help it, that I was going back. She got up from the table, went to her bedroom, and returned with her red-cardboard accordion folder, untying the red-string bow as she walked. And once again we looked at the strange little black-and-white snapshot of Andrew Carmody\u0027s gravestone. There it stood, mysteriously, among the gone-to-seed dandelions and sparse grass; a cartoonist\u0027s gravestone, the top a perfect half-circle, the sides straight, the whole stone sunk low in the ground and a little off kilter. And on the stone, sharp and clear, the strange design: no word, name or date, only the nine-pointed star inscribed in a circle, made from dozens of dots tapped into the stone; the design we\u0027d seen, incredibly, impressed in the snow at the base of a lamp standard, on Broadway, New York, January 23, 1882. We looked again, marveling, at the blue envelope and the black ink of its address, its ferrous content showing rusty through the black. Kate shook the note from the envelope and read aloud the top portion above the fold, in black. \" \u0027If a discussion of Court House Carrara should prove of interest to you, please appear in City Hall Park at half past twelve on Thursday next.\u0027 \" She lowered the note to look at me. \"And now we know,\" she said, her voice awed. \"We really know what happened in the park. I\u0027m glad Ira didn\u0027t.\" She lifted the note again, and read the portion below the fold. \" \u0027That the sending of this should cause the Destruction by Fire of the entire World\u0027—oh, what\u0027s the missing word!—\u0027seems well-nigh incredible. Yet it is so, and the Fault and the Guilt\u0027 \"—she paused to indicate the second missing word or words—\" \u0027mine, and can never be denied or escaped. So, with this wretched souvenir of that Event before me, I now end the life which should have ended then.\u0027 \" Kate slid the note back into its envelope. \"Do whatever it is they\u0027re sending you back for, Si; but find out for me what that note means. That\u0027s why you\u0027re ignoring Danziger, isn\u0027t it? You\u0027ve got to go back; you can\u0027t help it.\" And I nodded. Esterhazy had the good grace in the morning not to have taken over Dr. Danziger\u0027s office. We met in Rube\u0027s little cubbyhole, Rube in shirt-sleeves behind his desk, tilted far back in his swivel chair, hands clasped behind his head, grinning at me. Esterhazy half sat, half leaned against a corner of Rube\u0027s desk, very neat, almost military in a gray gabardine suit, white shirt, and dark tie. I sat on the one chair facing both of them. I was to go back and resume, was about all they had to say. They wanted to know whatever else I could learn about Andrew Carmody and what happened between him and Jake Pickering: The historians especially wanted to know, Rube said; they already had a team of two historians with a couple of postgrad student assistants at the Library of Congress digging up whatever they could on his relationship with Cleveland, and a second similar team at the National Archives. Anything I could learn might expand or illuminate whatever they should find out. The end result ofthis pilot test project, it was hoped, would be a workable method for enlarging our entire knowledge of history. On my way back to the Dakota—Rube drove me over—I told myself I was doing the right thing, the only thing; that there was no defect in the arguments I\u0027d listened to and had made myself. But if that was true, I had to wonder, why did I feel I was doing wrong? And why, if I was so sure of what I was doing, hadn\u0027t I talked to Dr. Danziger? There\u0027d been time to phone him; there still was. But I knew I wasn\u0027t going to. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1676/49413.html","bookId":1176,"book":{"id":1176,"title":"Time And Again","description":"简介： This book is a work of fiction.
