{"id":33799,"no":19,"title":"CHAPTER XVIII. THE BRIGANDS\u0027 HAUNT.","content":"BY daybreak on the following morning Hugh and his three companions were far among the hills. They had halted an hour before, and intended to wait until noon before pursuing their journey. They had already been eight hours in the saddle, and had travelled over sixty miles. They had halted in a little valley where there was plenty of grass for the horses, and after cooking some food lay down and slept until the sun was nearly overhead. Fortunately, the two miners had traversed the country several times, and were able to lead them across the mountains, where otherwise it would have been impossible to find a way. After four hours\u0027 riding, on emerging from a valley the doctor said: \"There, do you see that village three miles away? That is the village where we stopped. The gorge in which the house lies runs from the village in this direction. You cannot see it here: it is a sort of ca?on cut out ages ago by the water. The sides are nearly perpendicular; but at the upper end the bottom rises rapidly, and, as far as we could see from the spot from which we looked at it, there is no difficulty in getting down there. As you see, there are woods lying back to the left. We have got to come down at the back of them, and there is no chance of our being seen even if they have got men on the lookout on the high ground above the house. They will be looking the other way; they can see miles across the plain there. Of [322] course they have no reason to believe that anyone knows of their haunt; still, they are always on the look-out against treachery.\" \"Well, let\u0027s go on at a trot now, doctor. We shall be in the wood before sunset.\" When they reached the trees they dismounted, and led their horses until they perceived daylight through the trunks on the opposite side. \"Now we will finish the remainder of our dinner,\" the doctor said, \"and talk matters over. We are about half a mile now from the end of the valley, and it is another half-mile down to the house. Now, what are we going to do? Are we all going, or only one?\" Hugh was silent. These men understood matters better than he did. \"Only one, of course,\" Sim Howlett said. \"The others can come on to the top of the valley so as to lend a hand if he is chased; but it would be just chucking away lives for more than one to go. Well, it is either you or me, doc.\" \"Why?\" Hugh asked. \"I am quite ready to go, and I am sure Bill is too. Besides, this question of the young ladies is more my affair than yours, since you do not know them, and I certainly think I ought to be the one to go.\" \"There is one reason agin it, Lightning,\" Sim said. \"What you say is true, and if it came to running you could leg it a good bit faster than the doc. or me; but that don\u0027t count for much in the dark. It is creeping and crawling that is wanted more than running. The reason why the doc. or I must go is, you don\u0027t speak Mexican, and we do. It ain\u0027t likely that the young ladies will be seen out in the verandah, and one can\u0027t go and look into each of the windows till we find the right one. We have got to listen, and that way we may find whether they are there, and if we are lucky, which room they are in. So you see it is for one of us to go.\" [323] \"I shall go, Sim,\" the doctor said quietly. \"I can walk as lightly as a cat. I haven\u0027t above half as much bulk to hide as you have, and I am cunning while you are strong, and this is a case where cunning is of more use than strength. So it is settled that I go; but you may as well give me your six-shooter. I may want twelve barrels.\" \"I shall be sorry for the Mexicans if you use them all, doc.,\" Sim Howlett said, handing over his pistol to the doctor. \"I would rather go myself; but I know when you have once made up your mind to anything it ain\u0027t no sort of use argying.\" \"That\u0027s right,\" the doctor said, putting the weapon into his belt. \"Well, there is just time for a pipe before I start. The sun has been down nearly half an hour, and the moon won\u0027t be up over those hills there for another hour, so we shall have it dark till I get well down into the valley, and the moon won\u0027t be high enough to throw its light down there afore I am back again.\" \"A wonderful man is the doctor!\" Sim Howlett said when, with noiseless step, he had made his way down into the upper end of the ravine. \"You wouldn\u0027t think much of him to look at him. But, you bet, he has got as much grit as if he was ten times as big. See him going about, and you would say he might be one of them missionaries, or a scientific chap such as those as comes round looking after birds and snakes and such like. He sorter seems most like a woman with his low talk and gentle way, and yet I suppose he has killed more downright bad men than any five men on this side of Missouri.\" \"You don\u0027t say so!\" Hugh said in surprise. \"Yes, sir, he is a hull team and a little dog under the waggon, he is. He ain\u0027t a chap to quarrel; he don\u0027t drink, and he don\u0027t gamble, and he speaks everyone fair and civil. It ain\u0027t that; but he has got somethin\u0027 in him that seems to swell up when he hears of bad goings-on. When there is a real bad man comes to the camp where he is, and takes to bossing the show, and to shooting free, after a time you can see the doctor gets [324] oncomfortable in his mind; but he goes on till that bad man does something out of the way—shoots a fellow just out of pure cussedness, or something of that kind—then he just says this must be put down, and off he goes and faces that bad man and gives him a fair show and lays him out.\" \"You mean he doesn\u0027t fire until the other man is heeled, Sim?\" \"Yes, I mean that.\" \"Then how is it he hasn\u0027t got killed himself?\" \"That is what we have said a hundred times, Lightning. He has been shot all over, but never mortally. One thing, his looks are enough to scare a man. Somehow he don\u0027t look altogether arthly with that white hair of his—and it has been the same colour ever since I have known him—floating back from his face. He goes in general bareheaded when he sets out to shoot, and the hair somehow seems to stand out; not a bit like it does other times. I heard a chap who had been a doctor afore he took to gold-digging say his hair looked as if it had been electrified. Then he gets as white as snow, and his eyes just blaze out. I tell you, sirree, it is something frightful to see him; and when he comes right into a crowded saloon and says to the man, as he always does say in a sort of tone that seems somehow to frizz up the blood of every man that hears it, \u0027It is time for you to die!\u0027 you bet it makes the very hardest man weaken. I tell you I would rather face Judge Lynch and a hundred regulators than stand up agin the doctor when his fit is on; and I have seen men who never missed their mark afore shoot wide of him altogether.\" \"And he never misses?\" Royce asked. \"Miss!\" Sim repeated; \"the doctor couldn\u0027t miss if he tried. I\u0027ve never known his bullet go a hair\u0027s-breadth off the mark. It always hits plumb in the centre of the forehead. If there is more than one of them, the doc. turns on the others and warns them: \u0027Git out of the camp afore night!\u0027 and you bet they [325] git. He gives me a lot of trouble, the doc. does, in the way of nursing. I have put it to him over and over again if it is fair on me that he should be on his back three months every year, \u0027cause that is about what it\u0027s been since I have known him. He allows as it ain\u0027t fair, but, as he says, \u0027It ain\u0027t me, Sim, I have got to do it; I am like a Malay running a-muck—them\u0027s chaps out somewhere near China, he tells me, as gets mad and goes for a hull crowd—and I can\u0027t help it;\u0027 and I don\u0027t think he can. And yet you know at other times he is just about the kindest chap that breathes. He is always a-nussing the sick and sitting up nights with them, and such like. That is why he got the name of doctor.\" \"He isn\u0027t a doctor really then?\" Hugh asked. \"Waal, Lightning, all that\u0027s his secret, and ef he thinks to tell you, he can do it. I know he is the best mate a man ever had, and one of the best critters in God\u0027s universe, and that is good enough for me. I reckon he must be somewhere down among them Mexikins by this time,\" he went on, changing the subject abruptly. \"I almost wish one of us had gone with him,\" Royce said, \"so that if he should get found out we might make a better fight of it.\" \"He ain\u0027t likely to get found out,\" Sim said quietly, \"and ef he does he kin fight his way out. I don\u0027t know what way the doctor will die, but I allowed years ago that it weren\u0027t going to be by a bullet. I ain\u0027t skeery about him. Ef I had thought there wur any kind of risk, I would have gone with him, you bet.\" It was two hours before the doctor suddenly stood in the moonlight before them. They had been listening attentively for some time, but had not heard the slightest sound until he emerged from the shadow of the ravine. \"Well, doctor, are we on the right scent?\" \"The girls are there, Sim, sure enough. Now let us go back [326] to the wood before we talk. We have been caught asleep once on this expedition, when we thought we were so safe that we needn\u0027t be on the watch, and I don\u0027t propose to throw away a chance again.\" They went back without another word to the wood. As soon as they reached it the doctor sat down at the foot of a tree, and lighted his pipe; the others followed his example. \"Well, there was no danger about that job,\" he began. \"It seems not to have struck the fools that anyone was likely to come down from this end of the gulch. Down at the other end they have got two sentries on each side upon the heights. I could see them in the moonlight. I reckon they have some more at the mouth of the valley, down near the village; but you may guess I asked no questions about it. I saw no one in the gulch until I got down close to the house. It is as strong a place as if it had been built for the purpose. It stands on a sort of table of rock that juts out from the hill-side; so that on three sides it goes straight down. There is a space round the house forty or fifty feet wide. \"On the side where the rock stands out from the hill they have got a wall twelve feet high, with a strong gate in it. On that side of the house they have bricked all the windows up, so as to prevent their being commanded by a force on the hill-side above them, and all the windows on the ground-floor all round are bricked up too. I expect the rooms are lighted from a courtyard inside. So you see it is a pretty difficult sort of place to take all of a sudden. I could hear the voices of five or six men sitting smoking and talking outside the door, which is not on the side facing the hill, but on the other side. I guessed that when the house was built there must have been steps up from that side, for there is a road that runs along the bottom of the valley; so I crawled up and found that it was so. There had been a broad flight of steps there; they had been broken away and pulled down, still they were good enough for [327] me. There were one or two blocks still sticking out from the rock, and there were holes where other blocks had been let in, and I made a shift to climb up without much difficulty till I got my eyes level with the top. \"The moon hadn\u0027t risen over the brow, still it was lighter than I liked; but one had to risk something; so I first of all pulled myself up, crawled along the edge till I got round the corner, and then went up to the house and examined the windows on the other side, and then got back to the top of the steps and began to listen. I soon heard the girls were there. They had brought them straight there after they had carried them off. A man had started early the next morning with a letter to Don Ramon demanding ransom. He was expected back some time to-night. They had had news that so far the don was taking no steps to raise the country, though the news of the girls being carried off was generally known. I didn\u0027t hear what the sum named for the ransom was; but the men were talking over what they should each do with their share of it, and they reckoned that each would have seven or eight thousand dollars. \"Well, there wasn\u0027t anything new about this. The matter of interest to us was which was the room where the girls were. As the journey would have been of no sort of use if I could not find that out, there was nothing to do but to get up again and crawl along to the house. I had reckoned that I should most likely want my rope, and had wound it round my waist. There was a guard at the gate, so it was one of the sides I had to try. \"I had learned from what the men said that most of the gang were away scattered all over the country down to El Paso, so as to bring news at once if there was any search for the girls going on. The chief and his lieutenant were down in the village, and would ride in with the messenger who brought down Ramon\u0027s answer. There was a guard inside the house, because the men at the fire said it was time for two of them to [328] go and relieve them; but I guessed that otherwise the house was empty. I threw my rope over a balcony and climbed up, opened the fastening of the window with my knife, and went in. Everything was quiet. I felt my way across the room to a window on the other side. I opened that and looked down into the courtyard. Two or three lanterns were burning there, and I saw two men sitting on a bench that was placed across a door. They were smoking cigarettes, and had their guns leaning against the wall beside them. There was no doubt that was the room where the girls were. \"It was on the opposite side of the courtyard to that where I was standing—that is, on the side of the house facing down the valley,—and was the corner room. \"I had learned everything I wanted now, so I had nothing to do but to shut the window, slide down the rope, shake it off the balcony, and come back again; and here I am.\" \"Well done, doctor! You have succeeded splendidly. But what a pity we didn\u0027t all go with you. We could have cleared out that lot and rescued the girls at once.\" \"You might not have gone as quietly as I did,\" the doctor said. \"Four men make a lot more noise than one, and at the slightest noise the seven men at the door would have been inside, the door bolted, and the first pistol shot would have brought in the guard at the gate, the four sentries on the height, and I expect as many more from the mouth of the valley. It would have been mighty difficult to break into the house with nine men inside and as many out; besides, it would never do to run risks; and even if we had done it, and hadn\u0027t found the girls with their throats cut, we should have had to fight our way up the valley to the horses, and a bullet might have hit one of them. No, no; this is a case where we have no right to risk anything. It\u0027s for the don to decide what is to be done. Now we know all about it, and can lay it before him. Lightning, you had better saddle up and ride with me. [329] You must go, because he knows you, and will believe what you tell him. I must go, because he will want me to guide the force back here, so as to avoid any chance of their being seen on the way. The horses have done eighty miles since this time yesterday, so it\u0027s no use thinking of starting to-night. Besides, there is no hurry. We will be off in the morning.\" After breakfast Sim was about to saddle the doctor\u0027s horse, when Royce said: \"The doctor had better take my horse. He is miles faster than his own.\" The girths were tightened. The doctor, as he mounted, said to Sim, \"You will keep a sharp look-out over the house, and reckon up how many go in and come out. I expect if the don writes to say he will pay the money, a good many of those outside will come here.\" \"We will keep our eyes open, doctor.\" \"It may be two or three days before you hear of us, Sim.\" \"There is no hurry, doctor. There will be a lot of talk about how the ransom is to be paid afore anything is done.\" \"Do you mean to go back the same way we came?\" Hugh asked the doctor as they rode off. \"No, there is no occasion for that. We will ride thirty miles or so along the foot of the hills, east, and then strike straight by road for El Paso. It is about nine o\u0027clock now. We shall be there by five o\u0027clock. We won\u0027t go in together. I will wait on the road and come in by some other way after dark, or, what would be better, put up at José\u0027s. You had better not go up to the don\u0027s until to-morrow morning. Were you to go up directly you returned, the scoundrels who are watching both you and the don might suspect that your journey has had a connection with his business.\" Next morning Hugh arrived at Don Ramon\u0027s, having obtained another horse at the hotel. \"Why, where have you been, Se?or Hugh?\" Don Carlos exclaimed as the servant [330] showed him into the room where they were at breakfast. \"When I rode with my father into the town to give the alcalde notice, I went to the hotel and found that you were out. We sent over there three times yesterday and the day before, but they knew nothing of you. You had taken your horse and gone out the evening you returned, and had left no word when you would come back. We have been quite anxious about you, and feared that some harm had befallen you also. We were quite sure that you would not have left without telling us of your intentions.\" \"No, indeed,\" Hugh said. \"I should have been ungrateful indeed for your kindness if I had left you in such terrible trouble; but before I tell you what I have been doing, please let me know what has happened here.\" \"About mid-day, the day after my daughters had been stolen,\" Don Ramon said, \"a horseman rode up. I saw him coming, and guessed he was the man we were expecting. He was shown in here, and Carlos and myself received him. He handed me a letter. Here it is. I will translate it: \"\u0027Se?or Don Ramon Perales,—If you wish to see your daughters alive, you will, as speedily as possible, collect 200,000 dollars in gold and hand them over to the messenger I will send for them. When I receive the money your daughters shall be returned to you. I give you warning, that if any effort is made to discover their whereabouts, or if any armed body is collected by you for the purpose of rescue, your daughters will at once be put to death. Signed Ignatius Guttiero.\u0027\" \"And what did you reply, Don Ramon?\" \"I wrote that it would take some time to collect so great a sum in gold, but that I would send up to Santa Fé at once, and use every effort to get it together in the shortest possible time. I demanded, however, what assurance I could have that after the money was paid my daughters would be returned to me. To that I have received no answer.\" [331] \"No, you could hardly get one before this morning,\" Hugh said. \"You look surprised, se?or; but we have found out where they are hidden.\" \"You have found that out!\" the others cried in astonishment. \"My companions and I,\" Hugh said; \"indeed, beyond riding a good many miles, I have had but little to do with the matter. The credit lies entirely with the two miners I spoke to you of, with whom I was going shortly to start on an expedition to a placer they know of.\" He then related the reason why the miners had suspected where the gang of brigands had their headquarters, and the steps by which they had ascertained that the girls were really there; and then explained the scheme that he and the doctor had, on their ride down, arranged for their rescue. Don Ramon, his wife, and son were greatly moved at the narrative. \"You have, indeed, rendered us a service that we can never repay,\" Don Ramon said; \"but the risk is terrible. Should you fail it would cost you your lives, and would ensure the fate of my daughters.\" \"We are in no way afraid about our own lives, Don Ramon; there are not likely to be more than twenty of these scoundrels there, and if we were discovered before we could get to your daughters we could fight our way off, I think. In that case, seeing that there were only four of us, they certainly would not throw away their prospect of a ransom by injuring their captives. They would suppose that we had undertaken it on our own account as a sort of speculation, and though, no doubt, they would remove your daughters at once to some other place, they would not injure them. You see, our plan is that the force we propose shall be at hand, shall not advance unless they hear three shots fired at regular intervals. That will be the signal that we have succeeded in entering your daughters\u0027 apartment, and that they are safe with us; in that case you [332] will push forward at once to assist us. If, on the other hand, you hear an outbreak of firing, you will know that we have been discovered before we reached your daughters, and will retreat with your force silently, and return to El Paso by the same route by which you went out, and you would then, of course, continue your negotiations for a ransom.\" \"At any rate,\" Don Carlos said, \"I claim the right of accompanying you. It is my sisters who are in peril, and I will not permit strangers to risk their lives for them when I remain safe at a distance. You must agree to that, se?or.\" \"I agree to that at once,\" Hugh said. \"I thought that it was probable that you would insist upon going with us; it is clearly your right to do so.\" \"It must not be attempted,\" Don Ramon said gravely, \"if in any way I can recover my daughters by paying the ransom. The risk would be terrible, and although two hundred thousand dollars is a large sum, I would pay it four times over rather than that risk should be run. The question is, what guarantee the brigands will give that they will return their captives after they have received the money. I shall know that soon; we will decide nothing until I receive the answer.\" \"Would it not be well, se?or, for you to go over to arrange with the officer in command of the fort for twenty or thirty men to start with you at a moment\u0027s notice. If you decide to make this attempt to rescue your daughters the sooner we set about it the better, that is, if you intend to take troops instead of a party of your own men.\" \"I have already seen the commandant,\" Don Ramon said; \"he is a personal friend, and rode over here directly he heard the news, and offered to place the whole of his force at my disposal should I think fit to use it.\" At this moment a servant entered, and said that a man wished to see Don Ramon. The Mexican left the room, and returned in a minute with a letter. It was brief: \"Se?or, if [333] you want your daughters back again you must trust us; we give no guarantees beyond our solemn pledge. You will tell my messenger on what day you will have the money ready, and do not delay more than a week; he will come again to fetch it. See that he is not followed, for it will cost your daughters their lives if an attempt is made to find out where he goes. Your daughters will be returned within twenty-four hours of your sending out the money.\" \"We will try your plan, se?or,\" Don Ramon said firmly. \"I would not trust the word of these cut-throats, or their oaths even, in the smallest matter, and assuredly not in one such as this. What shall I say in reply to this letter?\" \"I should write and say that, although their conditions are hard, you must accept them, but that you doubt whether you can raise so large a sum of gold in the course of a week, and you beg them to give ten days before the messenger returns for it, and you pledge your honour that no attempt whatever shall be made to follow or to ascertain the course he takes.\" Don Ramon wrote the letter, and took it down to the hall, where the messenger was waiting, surrounded by servants, who were regarding him with no friendly aspect. \"There is my answer,\" Don Ramon said as he handed the letter to the man. \"Tell your leader I shall keep my word, and that I trust him to keep his. \"Now, Se?or Hugh, will you give me the details of your plan. How do you propose that the troops are to be close at hand when required without their presence being suspected?\" \"The doctor\u0027s idea was this, se?or. That you should this morning send a letter by a servant to the commandant. Will you tell him that you believe you have a clue to your daughters\u0027 hiding-place, but that everything depends upon the troops getting near the spot without suspicion being excited. Will you beg him to maintain an absolute silence as to any movements of the troops until to-night, and to issue no orders [334] until the gates are shut and all communication closed. Will he then order an officer and twenty men to be ready at four o\u0027clock in the morning to start under the guidance of a miner who will to-night arrive at the fort bearing your card. \"This will, of course, be the doctor. Request the officer to place himself absolutely in his hands. Our plan is that they shall keep the other side of the river, travel some thirty miles up, and then halt until nightfall. At that point they would be as far off from the brigands\u0027 hiding-place as they are here, and if the fact that a detachment has started becomes known to the friends of the brigands, it will not be suspected that there is any connection between their journey and the affair with your daughters. After nightfall they will start again, cross the river, and meet you and myself at one o\u0027clock, near the village of Ajanco. Thence we shall go up into the hills, rest there all day, and come down upon the gulch where the brigands\u0027 haunt lies.\" \"That sounds an excellent plan, se?or; but how do you propose that we shall get away without being noticed to-morrow evening?\" \"The doctor and I agreed that the best plan you could adopt would be to ride over and see your banker the first thing in the morning. That will seem perfectly natural. Then in the evening, after dark, you and Don Carlos should again ride down to him. You will naturally take at least four of your men down with you as a guard. You will leave your horses with them when you enter the banker\u0027s. You will then pass through his house, and at once leave by the back entrance, wrapped in your cloaks. You will then proceed to a spot half a mile out of the town, where Juan, who you say knows the country, will be waiting with your horses, and I also will be there. \"The people who are watching you—and you will certainly be watched—will naturally suppose that you are at the banker\u0027s. At ten o\u0027clock he will come to the door and tell your men to [335] return home with your horses and to bring them back at ten in the morning, as you and your son will sleep there. Even should anything be suspected—which is hardly likely—the scoundrels would have no clue whatever as to the direction you will have taken, as, at any rate, you will have had two hours\u0027 start before they can begin to think that anything is wrong.\" \"That is a capital plan, se?or. You keep on adding to our already deep obligations to you.\" Everything was carried out in accordance with the arrangements. Hugh returned at once to El Paso, and in the evening the doctor mounted his horse and rode to the fort. The next day passed quietly, and as soon as it became dark Hugh went out to the stable, saddled his horse without seeing any of the men about the yard, and rode off in the direction of Don Ramon\u0027s, and then, making a circuit of the town, arrived at the spot where Juan was waiting with the horses. They had been placed in a thicket a short distance from the road so as to be unobserved by anyone who might happen to pass. Hugh took his post close to the road, and an hour later Don Ramon and his son came up. The horses were at once brought out, and they mounted and rode off, Juan riding ahead to show the way. They maintained a fast pace, for at one o\u0027clock they were to meet the troops at the appointed place. They arrived a quarter of an hour before the time, and ten minutes after the hour heard the tramping of horses. The doctor was riding ahead, and halted when he came up to the group. \"Has all gone well, Lightning?\" he asked. \"Excellently, as far as we know.\" \"This is Lieutenant Mason, who is in command of the troops,\" the doctor said as a figure rode forward. \"Lieutenant Mason, this is Don Ramon Perales.\" \"You are punctual, se?or,\" the officer said. \"I have orders to place myself and my men entirely at your disposal. I think [336] we had better have half an hour\u0027s halt before we go further. We have ridden fast, and you must have ridden faster, as your guide told me you were not to leave El Paso until eight o\u0027clock, and I presume we have a good deal farther to go to-night.\" \"Another twenty miles,\" the doctor said. \"The moon will be getting higher, and we shall want all her light. It will do no harm if we halt an hour, lieutenant, and eat our supper while the horses are eating theirs.\" During the halt the doctor had a long talk with Juan, who came from this part of the country, and knew it well. When they mounted, instead of riding through the town, they struck off by a by-path before they reached it. Three hours later they were deep among the hills, and then again halted, after turning off from the track they had been following, into a ravine. The girths were loosened, and the horses allowed to graze, and the men, wrapping themselves in cloaks or blankets, were soon asleep, a sentry being placed at the entrance to the ravine. At ten o\u0027clock all were on their feet. Fires were lighted and breakfast cooked, and then, following mountain paths, they rode until two in the afternoon, at which time they reached the valley from which the party had before made their way down to the wood near the ravine. At dusk they again mounted and rode on to the wood. They were met at the edge of the trees by Sim Howlett and Royce. \"I was expecting you to-night, boys,\" Sim said. \"We looked out for you last night, but didn\u0027t reckon as you could possibly do it.\" \"Have you any news of my daughters?\" Don Ramon asked eagerly. \"Nary a word,\" Sim replied. \"Bill and me have never had our eyes off the house from sunup to sundown. Lots of fellows have come and gone on horseback. Of course we cannot answer for what has been done after nightfall, but we reckon there is about thirty men there now, not counting those they [337] may have in the village and the sentries down by the mouth of the valley. I calkilate the best part of the gang is there now. The chiefs would like to keep them under their eye. They will think the only thing they have got to be afraid of is treachery. I suppose matters stand as they did when you left, doc.?\" \"Just the same. We four and Don Carlos are to go on and get at the ladies. When we are in there safe three pistol shots are to be the signal. Then Don Ramon and the soldiers are to come down and surround them.\" Don Ramon had been very anxious to accompany the party, but the doctor had positively refused to take him with them. \"It would add greatly to our risks,\" he said, \"and do no good. If we can get to your daughters, Don Ramon, we five can keep the fellows at bay until you come up, easily enough. I believe we could thrash the lot, but it is no good taking chances; but anyhow, we can keep them off. I would rather have gone without your son, but as Lightning has passed his word, there is nothing more to be said. On a job like this the fewer there are the better. Each man after the first pretty nearly doubles the risk.\" By this time the troopers had dismounted and fastened their horses to the trees. Meat that had been cooked in the morning, and biscuits were produced from their haversacks. When the meal had been eaten the soldiers lit their pipes, while their officer proceeded with Hugh and the others to the lower end of the wood and walked on to the head of the ravine. \"There are the lights!\" Hugh said. \"Ah! I see they have lighted a fire on the terrace, Bill.\" \"I expect they are pretty crowded in the house,\" Bill said; \"but they go in to sleep. Sim and I have been down near the house twice, and though we were not quite close we were able to make pretty sure that except one sentry there and another at the gate, the rest all go in.\" \"How far are we to go down?\" the officer asked. [338] \"Well, I would rather you did not go down at all,\" Sim Howlett said. \"You can get down there from here in ten minutes after you start if you look spry, and I am desperately afraid some of your men might make a noise, which they would hear certain if everything was quiet. There is no fear of their being heard when the firing once begins down there; but if one of them fell over a rock and his gun went off before we had done our part of the affair, there would be an end of the whole business.\" \"That is what I think, Sim,\" the doctor agreed. \"We have said all along we might get the ladies out by ourselves, but again we mayn\u0027t be able to get them off at all. But we can defend them easy enough if we can get into their room. Five minutes won\u0027t make any difference about that, and it is everything to avoid the risk of noise until we get at them. If they discover us before we get there we just fall back fighting. They will think that we are only a small party, and the ladies will be none the worse.\" \"If you think that is the best way we must agree to it,\" Don Ramon said; \"but we shall have a terrible time until we get to you.\" \"Don\u0027t you be afeard,\" Sim Howlett said. \"The doctor, me, Lightning, and Bill could pretty well wipe them out by ourselves, and we reckon on our six-shooters a sight more than we do on the soldiers.\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3127/85998.html","bookId":897,"book":{"id":897,"title":"Redskin and Cow-Boy","description":"简介： Cedar Gulch was, in 1851, a flourishing camp.
