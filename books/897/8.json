{"id":33788,"no":8,"title":"CHAPTER VII. AMONG THE COW-BOYS.","content":"\"WELL, now you have got your horses and outfit, Hugh, what air you going to do next?\" Bill Royce said, after the rest of the party had got up from breakfast and gone out. \"I don\u0027t quite know, Bill,\" Hugh laughed; \"I thought of going teaming, but I am afraid my horse has spoilt me for that.\" \"Well, so I should say.\" \"I should like to be my own master for a bit,\" Hugh went on, \"and do some shooting and hunting on the plains, work across to Sante Fé, and then take anything that turns up. I have got three hundred dollars in cash; that will last me for a long time. But I don\u0027t like striking out for myself, I know nothing of the country or the life. What do you say to going with me, Bill?\" \"That is just what I have been turning over in my mind,\" Bill said. \"I know the plains powerful well, and have been hunting and shooting there for months. I was saying to myself, as like enough you would be thinking of striking out for a bit afore you settled down again to anything, and you would be wanting some one with you as could put you up to the ropes. I have got pretty sick of working here, but I have spent my money as fast as I have got it, and cannot afford to get an outfit; so I said to myself, if Hugh likes to start me with an outfit I think it would be about square, seeing as he knows nothing of the country, and I could put him straight there. We have worked together for a bit, and I [120] reckon we would get on first-rate. So if that would suit you it would just suit me.\" \"It suits me capitally, Bill; nothing could be better; it is just what I wanted. I don\u0027t suppose I should ever have gone by myself, but with you it would be the very thing to suit me. There\u0027s my hand on it.\" In another three days their preparations were made. Bill knew of a horse that could be picked up for forty dollars; two rifles were bought, a saddle and bridle for Bill, and saddle-bags for the spare horse. A large stock of ammunition was laid in; fifty pounds of flour, a few pounds of tea and sugar, four blankets, and a few odds and ends, completed the outfit. Royce had already a revolver, and on the morning of the fourth day they started from M\u0027Kinney, striking nearly due south, so as to work round the range of hills. For the first few days they passed occasional settlements, and then struck out across an open country. \"Now we may begin to look out for game,\" Royce said. \"You can shoot, I suppose, Hugh?\" \"I have had no practice whatever with the rifle, but I am a pretty good shot with a shot-gun.\" \"You will soon pick it up, anyhow,\" Royce said; \"anyone who can shoot as you do with a Colt, is sure to shoot pretty straight with a rifle.\" For the next four months Hugh and his companion wandered over the plains, and Hugh enjoyed the life immensely. They had directed their course toward the south-west, for winter was setting in when they started, and as the cold is sometimes severe in Northern Texas, they made down towards the Mexican frontier, and there enjoyed delightful weather. They found an abundance of game, and could have shot any number of deer, but they were useless to them, except for food. Herds of wild horses were sometimes seen, and occasionally, in quiet valleys, they came across half-wild cattle, which had strayed away from far-distant ranches. It was strange to Hugh to travel thus at will, to wander freely in whichever direction [121] fancy led them; sometimes passing a week or two without seeing any other human being; sometimes stopping for a night at the camp-fire of a party of cow-boys; sometimes bivouacking with a wandering hunter like themselves, or with a ranchman in search of stray animals. During this time their expenses had been next to nothing, their sole outlay being for flour, tea, and sugar, and even these they generally obtained in exchange for venison or other game. Hugh had learned to use his rope with considerable skill on horseback, for as soon as he got fairly away on the plains he had begun to practise. The first time he tried it upon his companion he would have given him a very heavy fall, had not Bill reined in his horse on to its haunches as soon as the rope fell over his shoulders; for Prince, as Hugh called his horse, was thoroughly up in his work. The instant the rope had been thrown he stopped and braced himself, with his fore-legs extended, to meet the shock, and had it not been for Bill\u0027s quickness he would in an instant have been torn from the saddle. \"Thunder!\" the latter exclaimed. \"Do you want to break my neck, Hugh?\" \"I had nothing to do with it!\" Hugh protested. \"Prince nearly sent me over his head. I had not the least idea of pulling him in, and was perfectly taken aback by his playing me that trick.\" \"We ought to have thought of it,\" Bill said. \"It was dead sure he would be trained to the work. The idea flashed across me just as the rope came down, and lucky it was so. Well, you will find plenty of other things to practise on as we go along. There are cattle enough running about here without owners, and if you come across a bunch of wild horses you can give chase and rope some of the young ones; and there are coyotes, they will give you plenty of sport that way.\" Hugh had used all these opportunities, and had come to throw the noose over the head of a flying animal as well as Bill Royce himself could do, but as yet he was unable to throw the rope round their legs with any certainty. As the spring [122] approached Hugh proposed that instead of carrying out their plan of going to Santa Fé they should for a time take service on a ranche. \"I enjoy this life immensely, Bill, and I should like to become thoroughly up to all the work. At present I am what you call a tender-foot, and I should certainly like to have a few months among the cow-boys.\" \"Just as well do that as anything else,\" Bill said. \"It is always handy to know that you can hold your own in a round-up and know the ways of cattle, and I tell you that there is plenty to learn. But, mind you, it ain\u0027t going to be like this time we\u0027ve been having. There\u0027s no fooling about a cow-boy\u0027s life: it is just about the hardest life there is. However, it won\u0027t be as hard for you as it is for most fellows. You can ride, though there ain\u0027t much merit in sitting on that horse of yours. Still I see you know your way among horses, and you have taught him to come to you when you whistle, and to do pretty nigh everything you want him to; but you will find it a mighty different thing when you get on the back of a broncho. However, it is worth learning to ride a horse that has never been backed. Anyhow, I am with you. I have had a spell at it, and don\u0027t mind having another; and there is one thing—you can quit when you like.\" \"But how about this horse? I should not like to give up Prince.\" \"Well, you could do as you like about that. Each cow-boy has six or eight horses—sometimes he has as many as a dozen—and he just ropes one out of the crowd and rides him as he has a fancy; so you could let Prince run with the rest and use him when you liked, or you could leave him at the headquarters station.\" \"What do they want such a lot of horses for?\" Hugh asked. \"They want them to do the work,\" Bill said. \"A man can go on pretty nigh for ever, but a horse can\u0027t. You will find that you can use up six horses in the twenty-four hours, and they want a day to rest before they are fit for work again. [123] Well, they will be starting on their round-up soon, so we may as well head in their direction so as to get taken on before they are full. I was working in the O triangle ranche two years ago; their station ain\u0027t above a hundred and fifty miles from where we are. The boss wasn\u0027t a bad sort. We may as well go there as to another.\" \"What do you mean by the O triangle, Bill?\" \"That is their brand—a circle in a triangle. We call them always by their brands. They have all sorts of names of their own, but they are never known by them. There is the O triangle, and the double A, and the cross T\u0027s, and the diamond square, and the half-circles, and a dozen others. Well, we will head that way to-morrow morning. I don\u0027t know that I shall be sorry to be in a crowd again for a bit. It gets lonesome when there are only two of you after a while.\" Hugh was beginning to feel this also. Their subjects of conversation had long been exhausted, and after the events of the day\u0027s hunting had been discussed there was little for them to talk about as they sat by their fire. On the evening of the third day they arrived at the headquarters station of the ranche. It consisted of a long, low building, which formed the storehouse and general room. Near it was the manager\u0027s house, and behind the barracks for the men. A short distance away was a fence which inclosed fifty or sixty acres of ground. Here were some of the more valuable of the animals: some handsome bulls and a couple of dozen good horses. Three or four waggons stood near the huts, and a number of horses were grazing about over the country. The huts themselves lay in a hollow, down which a small belt of trees extended. A score of men were standing or sitting near the huts, and as many more came out as the new-comers rode up. One or two of these recognized Bill Royce. \"Hello, Bill!\" one of them said; \"back again! I thought you had got rubbed out. Where have you been all this time?\" \"Been down in Mexico, and then back among the settlements, got tired of it, and here I am. Been hunting last. This is my [124] mate, gentlemen. He is a good sort, a Britisher, and his name is Hugh. Now, you are properly introduced!\" \"Glad to see you!\" the man said, holding out his hand to Hugh. \"Come to pay us a visit?\" \"No. I have come to work, if I can get work,\" Hugh said. \"Oh, there\u0027s plenty of work. Well, get off your horse. He is a good un, he is!\" Such was evidently the opinion of the rest of the cow-boys, for they gathered round and made remarks on Prince\u0027s points. \"He is too good for this sort of work altogether, leastways for most of it, though he would do well enough for scouting round and hunting for cattle among the foot-hills. Where did you get him?\" \"I bought him at M\u0027Kinney,\" Hugh said. \"Two fellows came along with him and wanted to sell bad, so I got him a bargain.\" \"I expect he didn\u0027t cost them much,\" the man said. \"Well, it is all right as long as you don\u0027t fall across the chap he was stolen from. If you do, there will be a good many questions asked, I can tell you. I guess he came from some Mexican ranche down south. You don\u0027t often see such a bit of horseflesh about here.\" \"Here is the boss, Hugh,\" Bill said; \"we may as well speak to him at once;\" and they walked together to a man who had just come out from the manager\u0027s house. \"Have you got room for two hands?\" Bill asked. \"I was here a couple of years back; my mate is new at this work, but he can ride and shoot and throw a rope.\" \"Oh, it\u0027s you, Bill, is it? Yes, I can put you both on; I am not quite full yet. Forty dollars a month for you; thirty for your mate till he learns his business.\" \"That will suit,\" Bill said. \"He won\u0027t be long before he gets up to the forty.\" \"He will find it hard work at first,\" the manager said; \"but he doesn\u0027t look as if that would hurt him.\" Bill and his companion now rejoined the group of cow-boys, while the manager went into the store. Hugh looked with [125] interest at the men who were to be his associates for some time. Their dress was similar to that of all the cow-boys he had met while hunting. They wore hats with a very wide, straight brim, and made of a stiff felt almost as hard as a board. Most of them wore a cord of gold or silver mixed with colour round it. All wore flannel shirts, with a handkerchief—which in the majority of cases was of silk—round their throats. Round the waist they wore a Mexican sash of bright colour. Their trousers were either of thick material, or of very soft tanned leather, and over these were chaperajos or Mexican overalls, with a coloured fringe down the outside seam. A few had jackets on, and these had also tufts of coloured fringe on the seams of the arms. They were most of them spare, active men, without an ounce of superfluous flesh. They were quiet in manner, with little of the reckless jollity of the ordinary frontiersman. Hugh was particularly struck with the keen, watchful expression of their eyes, the result of long nights of watching and of days spent on horseback in search of stray animals, and of danger from Indians. All carried a revolver on the hip or hind pocket, had a long knife stuck in their sash, and wore high boots cut away behind at the bend of the knee, but coming several inches higher in front. Following Bill\u0027s example, Hugh unsaddled his horse. \"Go off, old boy!\" he said, giving him a pat; and Prince walked leisurely away accompanied by his two companions, who always kept near to him. \"We cannot offer you a drink,\" one of the cow-boys said to Hugh. \"No liquor is allowed on the ranche. It comes rather hard at first, but it is best for us all.\" \"I have touched nothing for the last four months but tea,\" Hugh said, \"and don\u0027t care for spirits anyway.\" \"It would be a good thing if none of us did,\" the other said; \"but one must do something when one goes down to a town.\" Just at this moment a bell began to ring. \"There is supper,\" the man said. There was a general movement into the large hut. Here long [126] tables were laid out, and dishes piled up with meat, and great platters of potatoes, were ranged along at short intervals. Hugh was gifted with an excellent appetite, but he was astonished at the way in which the food disappeared. The meal was accompanied by a supply of very fair bread fresh from the oven, and tea with milk. \"Ewart keeps a few cows down here,\" the man next to Hugh said in answer to his remark about his not having seen milk for three months. \"Of course we don\u0027t get it at the out-stations.\" \"Who is Ewart?\" Hugh asked. \"Oh, he is boss; we don\u0027t have any misters out here—one man is as good as another. You have just arrived here at the right time. We have been driving in the horses from the ranche for the last three days, and to-morrow we are going to begin breaking them. Of course a good many of them were ridden last year, but there are a lot of bronchos among them. We have got a broncho-breaker out here.\" A broncho, Hugh knew, was a horse that had never been ridden. \"How do you do about horses?\" he said. \"Well, three or four of those that have been ridden before are told off to each man. Then, if anyone fancies a broncho, he can take him and break him for himself. Then men can swop with each other. You see some men ride better than others. Some men like quiet mounts; others don\u0027t mind what they sit on; and you see the best horses are very often the most full of tricks. You ride your horses as you like, but everyone keeps his quietest for night watches. You must have a quiet horse for that, for if your horse was to begin to play tricks he would stampede the cattle, sure.\" \"I suppose after they have been ridden one season they are quiet enough?\" Hugh said. \"Not a bit of it,\" the man replied. \"Some of them seem to get wickeder and wickeder. They get a bit better towards the end of the season, but six months\u0027 running wild does away with all that. I would just as soon take my chance with a [127] fresh broken broncho as with one that has been ridden before. They are wilder, you know, but not so cunning. An old horse seems to spend most of his time in thinking what game he shall be up to next, and when you see one walking along as if he had never done anything but walk along all his time, just look out, or you will find yourself six feet up in the air.\" Supper over, pipes were lighted, and Hugh listened with great interest to the talk going on around him. Some of the men had been on the ranche all the winter; others had been away, some back in the settlements, others in New Mexico, where they had been either loitering away their time in the towns or working on Mexican ranches. Hugh was struck with the quiet way in which they talked, the absence of argument, and the air of attention with which each speaker was listened to. He thought he had never been among a more quiet set of men, and wondered if these could be really the cow-boys of whose wild doings he had heard such tales. Gradually one by one they lounged off to the hut behind, and he and Bill soon went off also. It consisted of one room about sixty feet long. A stove with a huge fire burned in the middle, for the nights were cold. Down both sides and along the ends extended a double row of bunks. In the great majority of these lay blankets, showing that they were occupied. Choosing two empty ones, they placed the blankets and other articles they had taken from their saddles in them, put their belongings under their heads, rolled themselves in their blankets, and were soon sound asleep. The first thing next morning they handed over to the storekeeper the remainder of their flour, tea, and sugar. The value of these was credited to them, and they took out the amount in a couple of pairs of chaperajos, two cow-boy hats and two pairs of high boots, paying the balance in cash; they then joined the cow-boys. These were gathered in an inclosure with a very strong fence adjoining the fenced-in ground. Several cow-boys rode off as they entered, and in a quarter of an hour a mob of horses was seen approaching, the men [128] riding behind cracking their whips and yelling at the top of their voices. The gates were opened, and a couple of minutes later the horses rushed in. There were some forty or fifty of them, and of these about two-thirds were branded. In the first place the others were speedily roped both by the head and hind legs. Four cow-boys hung on to the ropes while another approached with a heated brand and applied it to the animals\u0027 hind quarters, the horses kicking and struggling wildly. As soon as the operation, which lasted but a second or two, was completed the ropes were loosed, and the frightened animals rejoined their companions, who were huddled in a corner of the inclosure. \"Now, each man of No. 1 and No. 2 outfit take one of the horses,\" the manager said. Hugh and Bill had the night before been told that they were to form part of No. 2 outfit. Like the others they had their ropes in their hands, and had brought their saddles inside the inclosure. Hugh picked out a horse that struck him as being a good one, and threw his lasso round its neck. One of the cow-boys belonging to the other outfit, who was standing by, said: \"That is a pretty bad horse, mate. I would take a quieter one if I were you.\" \"I have got to learn to sit them,\" Hugh replied; \"so I may as well begin with a bad one as a good one.\" \"All right,\" the other said, taking hold of the rope, and helping Hugh haul upon it. The animal resisted violently, but the pressure of the rope half-choked him, and he was forced to leave the group and come up to them. \"I will hold him,\" Hugh\u0027s assistant said. \"Get your saddle and bridle.\" There was some difficulty in putting these on, for the animal kicked, plunged, and reared furiously, and it was only when another cow-boy threw a rope, and, catching one of its hind legs, pulled it out stiffly behind, that Hugh succeeded in saddling it. \"Now, up you go!\" the man said. Gathering up the reins Hugh sprang into the saddle, and the two men, as soon as they saw him seated, slipped off the ropes. For a [129] moment the horse stood perfectly still. \"Keep his head up,\" one of the men shouted; but before Hugh could draw in the reins the horse dropped its head to its knees. Then it seemed to Hugh that it doubled itself up, and before he knew what had happened he felt himself flying through the air, and came down to the ground with a crash. There was a shout of laughter from the cow-boys, but two or three of them helped Hugh, who for a moment was almost stunned, to his feet. \"That is bucking, I suppose,\" he said as soon as he could get breath. \"That\u0027s bucking, sure enough,\" one of those who had helped him said. \"Well, I will try again in a minute,\" Hugh said. \"Take it quietly,\" the man said good-naturedly. \"You fell pretty heavy, and you are shaken up a bit. You\u0027d better hitch him on to the fence, and look about you for a few minutes before you try again.\" Hugh thought the advice good, and after fastening up the horse stood watching the man they called the broncho-breaker, who was fighting one of the most vicious of the last year\u0027s horses. Had he not seen it, Hugh would not have believed it possible that a horse could go through such performances. He had ridden many vicious brutes at home, and had thought that he knew something of horses, but this was a new experience for him. In the rearing, kicking, and plunging there was nothing novel, and as the horses were much smaller than the English hunters to which he had been accustomed he felt that if this had been all he should have no difficulty in keeping his seat, but the bucking was new to him. To perform it, it was necessary that the horse should be able to get its head down. The moment this was done it sprang straight into the air, at the same moment rounding its back, and this with such a sharp, sudden jerk that it fairly threw the rider into the air. On coming down the animal kept its legs stiff, so that the jerk to the rider was scarcely less than that of the upward spring, and before he had time to settle himself in the slightest [130] the horse repeated the performance, varying it occasionally by springing sideways, backwards, or forwards. The breaker, or as they were generally called the broncho-buster, kept his figure perfectly upright, with a tremendous grip upon the saddle with his thighs, but depending, as Hugh could see, rather upon balance than upon his hold. The exertion was evidently great. The man\u0027s hat had been jerked off, the perspiration stood upon his bronzed forehead. From time to time he dug his spurs into the animal\u0027s flanks, and excited it to continue its desperate efforts, until at last the horse was utterly exhausted and stood with its head drooping unable to make another effort. There was a shout of applause from the cow-boys looking on. \"Bully for you, Jake! He is a brute, that is, and no mistake.\" \"I will give him a turn every day for a week,\" Jake said. \"He is worth taking trouble with. I will take him for a gallop to-morrow.\" \"Do they buck when they are galloping?\" Hugh asked the cow-boy next to him. The latter nodded. \"Not when they are going at their best pace. They haven\u0027t time to do it then, but when they are going at hand-gallop they will do it. They wait until you are off your guard, and then up they go in the air and come down perhaps three yards sideways, and it\u0027s fifty to one against your being on their back when they do come down.\" \"I see how it is done now, though I don\u0027t see how I can do it,\" Hugh said. \"But I will try again.\" \"THE NEXT JUMP THREW HIM FAIRLY OVER THE HORSE\u0027S HEAD.\" The horse was led out, and Hugh again mounted. This time he was prepared for what was to come, but in spite of the grip with his legs the blow lifted him far above the saddle. It seemed to him that the next buck came before he had fairly descended, for it struck him with the force and suddenness of an electric shock. Again and again he was thrown up, until he felt his balance going, and the next jump threw him fairly over the horse\u0027s head, but as he was prepared for the fall it was much less heavy than the first time. [131] \"Well done! well done!\" several of the cow-boys said as he rose to his feet. \"You will do, you will, and make a good rider before long. That will do for to-day; I would not try any more.\" \"I am going to try it until I can sit him,\" Hugh said. \"I have got to do it, and I may as well go on now before I get stiff.\" The broncho-breaker came up to him as, after waiting a minute or two to get his breath, he again prepared to mount. \"Don\u0027t keep your back so stiff, young fellow. Just let your back go as if there was no bones in it. I have known a man\u0027s spine broke before now by a bucker. Sit easy and lissom. Keep your head, that is the principal thing. It ain\u0027t easy when you are being pitched up and down like a ball, but it all turns upon that. Let your legs close on him tight each time you come down, if only for a moment, that saves you from being thrown clean away from him.\" Hugh sprang on to the horse, and the struggle again began. It ended like the last, but Hugh had kept his seat somewhat longer than before. Again and again he tried, each time with more success. The fifth time he felt that the horse\u0027s action was less sudden and violent, and that it was becoming fatigued with its tremendous exertions. \"Now, you brute,\" he muttered, \"it is my turn;\" and he dug his spurs into the horse. A spring more violent than any he had yet felt followed the application, and for a minute or two he was almost bewildered by the force and rapidity of the animal\u0027s springs; but he was now confident that he was gaining the mastery, and the moment he found that its efforts were decreasing, he again applied the spurs. The response was less vigorous than before, and in five minutes the animal stood exhausted and subdued. A cheer broke from the cow-boys who were standing round looking on at the struggle. \"Well done, young fellow! you are the toughest tender-foot I have ever seen,\" one of them said, shaking him by the hand. \"I don\u0027t believe there are ten men in the camp who would [132] have sat that horse as you have, and you say that it is the very first time you have been on a bucker.\" \"I have beaten him,\" Hugh said, \"but he has pretty well beaten me. You must help me off my saddle, for I feel as if my back was broken, and that I could not lift my leg over the saddle if my life depended on it.\" Two cow-boys lifted him from his seat. \"That is a hard tussle, mate,\" the broncho-breaker said, coming up to him, \"and you have stuck to it well. You are clear grit, you are. The best thing you can do is to walk about for the next hour; just keep yourself moving, then go and wrap yourself up in two or three blankets and lie down in your bunk for a bit, have a thorough good sweat, and then strip and rub yourself down. Get your mate to rub your back well, and then dress and move about. The great thing is not to get stiff; but you will feel it for a day or two.\" Hugh followed the advice, but he found it hard work to do so. He was bruised all over with his falls; he scarce seemed able to put one leg before another, and at every movement a sharp pain shot through the loins, and he felt as if his spine had been dislocated. Still, for an hour he walked about, and at the end of that time felt that his movements were more easy; then he went to the hut, wrapped himself in Bill\u0027s blankets and his own, and presently dozed off to sleep. A couple of hours later he woke and saw Bill standing beside him. \"Now, Hugh, you had better turn out and let me give you a rub. Just take off that shirt. I have got a lump of hog\u0027s grease here.\" Hugh got out of the bunk with some difficulty and took off his shirt. \"Now, you lean your hands on that bunk and arch your back; that\u0027s it. Now here goes.\" For a good half-hour Bill worked at his back, kneading it with his knuckles down both sides of the spine and across the loins. \"Now, you will do,\" he said at last. \"Put on a dry shirt and come out.\" Hugh strolled down to the stock-yard. He felt wonderfully [133] better after the rubbing, and was able to walk with far greater ease than before. The scene in the yard was unchanged. Fresh groups of horses had been driven in as fast as the others had been saddled and mounted, and by nightfall each of the cow-boys had been provided with three horses. Hugh was greatly amused at the scene, for the spills were numerous, and the shouting and laughter incessant. The next day the work of breaking in the bronchos commenced. One after another they were roped and dragged out of the drove. The bridle was slipped on, and they were then blindfolded while the saddle was put on and fastened. Then Jake mounted. The cloth was drawn off the animal\u0027s head, and the struggle commenced. The horses tried every means to unseat their rider, but in vain. Some submitted after comparatively short struggles. Others fought long and desperately. As soon as the first victory was won bars were let down, and the horse was taken for a long gallop across the country, returning home subdued and trembling. Then the process was repeated with a fresh animal. \"How long does he take to break them?\" Hugh asked a cow-boy. \"Three days generally; sometimes he will ride them four or five times, but three is generally enough. Then they are handed over to us to finish.\" \"It must take a lot out of them,\" Hugh said. \"It would be better to do it more gradually. You see they are scared nearly to death before they are begun with.\" \"He cannot afford the time,\" the man said. \"He gets two dollars a horse for breaking them. He will be here for a fortnight, and in that time he will do pretty well a hundred. Then he will go off somewhere else.\" \"It must be tremendous work for him,\" Hugh said. \"It is that, you bet. A broncho-buster seldom lasts above two years. They get shaken all to pieces and clean broke up by the end of that time.\" As fast as the horses were broken in they were handed over to the cow-boys, and Hugh, who had been unable to do any [134] work for two days, then began to break in the lot that were to be his particular property. But he was fond of horses, and could not bring himself to use such violent measures as those which he saw adopted by his companions. The first lesson they taught them was to stand still the moment a rope fell over their necks. The animal was led up to the stump of a tree and then loosed; it at once went off at full speed, but as it did so its owner threw the noose of his rope over its head, and then gave the other end a turn round the stump. The shock was tremendous, the horses being frequently jerked right over on to their backs. Two or three experiences of this sort was sufficient, and the animal thenceforth learned to stand, not only when a rope was thrown round its neck, but even when the reins were dropped upon it, so that when its master dismounted it remained perfectly quiet until he again mounted and took the reins in his hand, even if he was absent a considerable time. As the teams were to start in a few days on the round-up, Hugh felt that it would be useless for him to attempt to break the horses in by English methods, and he was therefore obliged to adopt those in use by his companions. He mollified them, however, to some extent by getting another rope and tying it to his own. He then took only half a turn round the stump, and let the rope run out, at first fast, but checking it gradually until its pressure upon the neck brought the animal half suffocated to a stop. It took him longer to accomplish his object, but he found that by the end of a week the seven horses had all learned their lessons; each having been ridden for an hour every day. He had had several severe battles with the animal he had first mounted, which was by far the most vicious of them; but the struggle each day had become less severe, as the horse recognized the futility of endeavouring to unseat its master. Hugh had many falls during the schooling, but he was upon the whole well satisfied with the result. Several of the cow-boys had advised him to use the methods they adopted for securing them in their seats upon specially [135] vicious horses. One of these methods was the fastening of a loop of leather to the high pommel. Holding this in the hand, it was well-nigh impossible to be bucked from the saddle, but there was the disadvantage that if the strap broke, nothing could save a rider from a fall far more violent and heavy than that which came from being pitched from the saddle in the ordinary way. Another method was to fasten a strap passed under the horse\u0027s belly tightly below each knee; but this, although it held the riders in their saddles, had the serious disadvantage, that in the event of the horse rearing and falling back, or of its falling headlong from putting its foot in a hole, the rider could not free himself, and was almost certain to be crushed under the horse. Others, again, fastened themselves by bringing their feet together, and crossing their spurs, under the horse\u0027s belly, a safer measure than the last, but objectionable inasmuch as the spurs when the animal bucked struck him in the belly, and so increased the violence of his action. Of course the best riders refrained from using any of these methods, trusting only to their leg grip and to balance; and Hugh determined to ride in this way, even if it did cost him a few more falls. He was on excellent terms with the rest of the cow-boys. The tender-foot, as a new-comer is called, is always the subject of endless pranks and annoyances if he evinces the least timidity or nervousness; but if, on the other hand, he shows that he has pluck, determination to succeed, and good temper, he is treated with kindness and cordiality. Hugh\u0027s exhibition, therefore, of courage and horsemanship on the occasion of his first attempt at once won their liking and admiration, and all were ready to lend him a hand when necessary, and to give him hints and advice, and he was free from any of the annoyances to which new hands are often exposed. There were several other tender-feet among the party. Two or three of these got on fairly and soon ceased to be butts; but the rest, before a week was up, found the work altogether too trying, and one after another went off in search of some less dangerous occupation. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3127/85987.html","bookId":897,"book":{"id":897,"title":"Redskin and Cow-Boy","description":"简介： Cedar Gulch was, in 1851, a flourishing camp.
