{"id":33796,"no":16,"title":"CHAPTER XV. WITH THE WAGGON TEAMS.","content":"SOON after daybreak on the twelfth day the watch, which had now been carefully kept up for some days, reported that two Indians were galloping at full speed up the valley. A cheer broke from the defenders of the butte, for they doubted not that these brought news of the approach of a relieving party. When the horsemen arrived at the main encampment out on the plain a stir was immediately visible, and in two or three minutes the Indians were seen running out to the horses grazing on the plain beyond, while loud yells rang through the air. \"Those who have got rifles had better come to the edge,\" Long Tom shouted. \"All these fellows who are here will be scooting out on the plain in a minute. We must stop a few of them anyhow.\" A minute or two later scores of Indians dashed out from the trees at the foot of the buttes, and ran towards their encampment. The whites at once opened fire, but a running man far below is a difficult mark, and not a single shot took effect. \"You don\u0027t call that shooting,\" Broncho Harry said indignantly. \"It is all very well, Harry,\" Hugh said, \"but a brown spot three hundred feet below you, and as many yards away, isn\u0027t an easy mark.\" \"Waal,\" Harry said, \"it can\u0027t be helped. Now we will get ready to go out to lend a hand to our friends. Let us have a [261] couple of ropes; we will tie them to the branches one by one and haul them up. There is no fear of an attack. Now look here, Jim, you and your lot had best stop here to guard the women, and we will sally out. There are five of you; that will be plenty.\" The man on watch now gave a shout. \"I can see them,\" he said. \"How many of them?\" \"I guess there is about eighty. There is a thick clump in the middle, I reckon that they are the soldiers, and thirty or forty riding loose; I allow they are cow-boys.\" \"That is just about the right number,\" Harry said; \"if there was more of them the Indians wouldn\u0027t fight. I don\u0027t know as they will now, but seeing as there must be three hundred of them, I expect they will try it. Now, then, up with these branches.\" In a quarter of an hour the branches were all hauled out of the gap. While this had been going on the women had given a feed and a good drink of water to the horses, for there was no occasion any longer to husband their resources. The animals were now saddled and led down through the gap. By this time the Indians were all mounted, and were moving in a close body across the plain to meet the advancing foe. \"Now, Jim,\" Broncho Harry said, \"you stand on the edge, and when you see the fight begin you wave your hand. We can\u0027t make a start until they are at it, and we sha\u0027n\u0027t be able to see down below there.\" The cow-boys made their way down to the plain and then mounted. They sat for ten minutes with their eyes fixed upon Jim Gattling. Presently he waved his arm, and with a shout they started at a gallop. As soon as they were fairly out on the plain they heard the sound of fire-arms, and after galloping half a mile came suddenly in view of the combat. The Indians had boldly closed with the troops and cow-boys, who were now [262] driven together. A desperate hand-to-hand conflict was raging. Swords flashing in the sun, waving tomahawks, and spears could be seen above the mass. The cracking of revolvers was incessant, and a light smoke hung over the conflict. \"They are hard at it, boys,\" Long Tom exclaimed; \"now don\u0027t shout until we are on them. They are too busy to notice us. Keep well together, and we shall go through them like a knife.\" Not a word was spoken as they galloped down upon the scene of conflict. When they were within a hundred yards a cry of warning was raised, and some of the Indians faced round; but in a moment, with a loud shout, the band of cow-boys charged down upon them and cleft their way into the mass, horse and rider rolling over under the impetus of the onslaught. The deadly six-shooters spoke out, while the Indians fell thickly around them; and in a minute they had joined the whites in the centre of the mass. There was a shout of welcome, and then the officer commanding the troops cried: \"Now is your time, lads; press them hard, give it them hot!\" and the united party attacked the Indians with fresh vigour. Up to this time there had been little advantage on either side. Many more of the Indians had fallen than of the whites, owing to the superiority of the latter\u0027s weapons, especially the revolvers of the cow-boy section. Still their great superiority in numbers was telling, and when the six-shooters were emptied the cow-boys had no weapons to oppose to the spears and tomahawks of the Indians. The sudden attack from the rear, however, had shaken the Red-skins. In the momentary pause that had ensued many of the cow-boys slipped fresh cartridges into their pistols, and in a short time the Indians began to give ground, while the less courageous of them wheeled about their horses\u0027 heads. THE COW-BOYS CHARGED DOWN UPON THE INDIANS. War Eagle and some of the chiefs fought desperately; but when the former fell, cut down by one of the troopers, a panic [263] spread among his followers, and as if by a sudden impulse they turned and fled. The pursuit was a short one, for the horses of the rescuing force were jaded with the long journey they had performed; those of the party from the butte were weakened by hunger, while the ponies of the Indians had been doing nothing for days, and speedily left them behind. After hearty congratulations by the rescuers, and sincere thanks by those whom they had relieved from their peril, the party returned to the scene of conflict. Four troopers and two cow-boys had fallen, and a score had received wounds more or less serious; while on the part of the Indians over thirty lay dead. Graves were dug for the fallen whites, the wounds of the others were bandaged up, and they then proceeded to the butte, at whose foot the women, and the settlers who had been left to guard them, had already gathered, they having hurried down as soon as they saw the plain covered with flying Indians. Steve had returned with the rescuing party, and had been severely wounded in the fight, a blow from a tomahawk having cut off one of his ears, wounded his cheek, and inflicted a terrible gash on his shoulder. He was, however, in the highest spirits. \"I sha\u0027n\u0027t look so purty, my dear,\" he said to his daughter, who burst into tears at the sight of his injury, \"but then I was not anything uncommon afore, and I haven\u0027t any thought of going courting again. Waal, we have given the Injuns a smart lesson.\" When the handshaking and congratulations ceased, the captain commanding the cavalry held a consultation with Steve and some of the cow-boys as to the advisability of following up the victory and attacking the Indians in their own villages. \"I should not feel justified in doing it unless I was pretty certain of success. The commandant of the fort gave me orders to rescue this party, and I have done so; but he said nothing about engaging in a regular campaign with the Indians.\" [264] \"I shouldn\u0027t try, captain,\" Steve said. \"I reckon they haven\u0027t half their force here to-day—no, nor a quarter—for they reckon to put a thousand fighting men in the field. They didn\u0027t guess as any of us had got off to get help, and knew that they had plenty here to keep us caged upon the butte. Another thing is, the cow-boys with us air all employed on the ranches, and although they came off willing to rescue the women, and pay the Injuns off for that murdering business at our settlement, I reckon they will want to be off again to their work. But even with them we ain\u0027t no match for the forces the Red-skins can collect, so if you will take my advice, captain, you won\u0027t waste a minute, for thar is no saying how soon they will be down on us again, and if they did come the fight to-day wouldn\u0027t be a sarcumstance to the next.\" \"You are right,\" the officer said; \"it would be folly to risk anything by waiting here. I suppose you are all ready to start.\" \"I reckon so,\" Steve said; \"the horses have all been brought down from the hill.\" The officer at once gave orders to mount. While this conversation had been going on, Hugh, who was occupied in giving Prince a good feed from the grain the soldiers had brought for their horses, saw one of the troopers staring at him. \"Hullo, Luscombe!\" he exclaimed, \"who would have thought of seeing you here!\" \"I thought I couldn\u0027t be mistaken, Hugh,\" the other exclaimed as they grasped each other\u0027s hands; \"but you have changed so much, and widened out so tremendously in the eighteen months since I left you, that for a moment I wasn\u0027t sure it was you. Well, this is luck, and it is quite a fluke too. I was getting heartily sick of doing duty at that wretched fort, where one day was just like another, and there was nothing in the world to do except cleaning one\u0027s traps, when a letter arrived [265] from the governor. I told you the old boy was sure to give in sooner or later, and he sent me money to get my discharge and take me home. I was just going to the commanding officer to make my application when Rutherford rode into camp. It was evidently something very important, for his horse fell dead as he drew rein. So I waited to hear the news, and found that our troop was ordered to mount instantly to ride to the rescue of a party of settlers and cow-boys who were besieged by the Indians. \"You may guess I dropped my letter into my pocket and said nothing about it. We have done a good deal of scouting, and had two or three paltry skirmishes with the Indians, but nothing worth talking about; and this seemed, from what Rutherford said, to be likely to be a regular battle, and so, you see, here I am. It has been a jolly wind-up for my soldiering. And to think that you should be one of the party we have ridden something like three hundred miles to rescue! Now tell me all about yourself.\" At this moment the trumpet to saddle sounded. \"I will tell you as we ride along,\" Hugh said. \"I don\u0027t suppose there will be any particular order kept on our way back.\" Five minutes later the whole party were cantering down the valley. They did not draw rein until late in the afternoon, and then halted on the banks of the Canadian. A strong cordon of sentries was posted that night, but there were no signs of Indians, and the next day the party reached one of the ranche stations. During the two days\u0027 march and at the camp Hugh and Luscombe had kept together, the latter having obtained permission from his officer to fall out of the ranks, upon his telling him that one of the cow-boys was an old friend who had come with him from Europe. \"I shall be off in a month or two,\" Luscombe said when they [266] parted that evening. \"I expect there are formalities to be gone through here just as there are in England. You are quite sure there is no chance of your going home with me?\" \"Quite sure. I have another three years to stop out here yet, and then I can go back and claim my own. I wrote to Randolph, my trustee you know, to tell him I am alive and well, and very glad that I did not kill that uncle of mine, and saying that I shall return when I am of age, but not before. What do you mean to do, Luscombe?\" \"I am going to settle down,\" Luscombe said. \"I can tell you a year\u0027s work as trooper in one of these Yankee forts is about enough to make a man sick of soldiering. I have eaten the bread of adversity, and very hard bread it is too, and there is mighty little butter on it. I am going in for fatted calf when I go back, and am quite prepared to settle down into a traditional squire, to look after fat beeves, become interested in turnips, and to be a father to my people. Well, anyhow, Hugh, you will let me know when you come back to England. You know my address; and as soon as you have kicked that uncle of yours out, and have squared matters generally, you must come straight to me. You will be sure of the heartiest welcome. The governor is a capital old boy, and if he did cut up rusty, the wonder is he didn\u0027t do it long before. My mother is a dear old lady, and the girls—there are two of them—are first-rate girls; and the youngest, by the way, is just about the right age for you. She was fourteen when I came away.\" Hugh laughed. \"I shall very likely bring home an Indian squaw or a Mexican, so we won\u0027t build on that, Luscombe; but when I go back to England you shall hear of me, and I accept the invitation beforehand.\" On the following morning the party broke up. The troops started back for the fort. Steve Rutherford and the cow-boys rode for a time south-west, and then worked their way over [267] the foot-hills and came down into the plains of Texas, and after a week\u0027s travel returned to the village from which they had started. It had already begun to rise from its ruins. Waggon-loads of lumber had been brought up from below, and there was no lack of willing hands from other scattered settlements to aid in the work of rebuilding the houses. Little attention was paid to the party as they rode up from the plains, for it was not on that side that a watch had been kept up for their return, and indeed the eyes of the survivors had almost ceased to turn towards the mountains, for hope had well-nigh died out, and it had been regarded as certain that the whole party had been cut off and massacred by the Indians. As soon, however, as the news spread that there were women among the approaching troop, axes, saws, and hammers were thrown down, and there was a rush to meet them. The scene was an affecting one, as mothers clasped daughters and women embraced their husbands, whom they had never thought to see again. The cow-boys were pressed to stay there for the night, but they refused as they were anxious to return to the ranche, from which they had been absent more than three weeks. Fortunately, the busy season was almost over when they left, and they knew that there were enough hands on the ranche to look after the cattle during their absence. On the way back Broncho Harry said to Hugh: \"I expect, Hugh, a good many of us will be getting our tickets before long. They don\u0027t keep on more than half their strength through the winter. What are you thinking of doing? If you would like to stop on I will speak to the boss. I reckon I shall have charge of an outfit this winter, and can manage for you and Stumpy.\" \"Thank you very much, Broncho, but, as I have told you often, I don\u0027t want to stop. I have had a season\u0027s life as a cow-boy, but I have no idea of sticking to it, and mean to have a try at something else. I intend to go back to England when [268] I am twenty-one. I have some property there, and have no need to work. I got into a scrape at home with the man who is my guardian, and don\u0027t care about turning up until he has no longer any authority over me.\" \"Waal, you know your own business, Lightning. It is a pity, for in another year you would make one of the best hands on the plains.\" \"If I were to stay for another year I expect I should stay for good, Harry. It is a hard life, a terribly hard life; but it is a grand one for all that. There is nothing like it in the way of excitement, and I don\u0027t wonder that men who once take to it find it very difficult to settle down to anything else afterwards. Therefore, you see, it is just as well to stop before one gets too fond of it. I know I shall always look back upon this as the jolliest time of my life, and I am lucky to have gone through it without having been damaged by a cow, or having my neck broken by a broncho, or being shot by an Indian. Royce has made up his mind to go with me, and as soon as we get our discharge we shall make our way to New Mexico, and perhaps down into Arizona; but of course that must depend upon other things.\" Upon reaching the station they found that, as Harry had predicted, hands were already being discharged. The manager said, when they went to him and told him that they wished to leave, \"Well, I had intended to keep you both on for the winter; but of course if you wish to go, there is an end of it, and there are so many anxious to be kept on that a man in my position feels almost grateful to those who voluntarily afford vacancies.\" There were very hearty adieus between Hugh and Royce and Broncho Harry, Long Tom, and the others who had been their close companions for months. Then they mounted and rode off from the station. They had heard from a man who had just arrived that a large waggon-train was on the point of [269] starting from Decatur for Santa Fé. It was composed of several parties who had been waiting until a sufficient force was collected to venture across the Indian country. There were several waggon-trains going with supplies for the troops stationed at the chain of forts along the line. Others had goods for Santa Fé; while a third was freighted with machinery and stores for mining enterprises farther south in New Mexico. It took Royce and Hugh a week to traverse the country to Decatur, and on arriving there they heard that the teams had started two days before. They waited a day at Decatur to buy a pack-horse and the necessary stores for their journey, and then set out. In two days they overtook the train, which consisted of forty waggons. Learning which man had been selected as the leader of the party they rode up to him. \"We are going to Santa Fé,\" Royce said. \"We are both good shots and hunters, and we propose to travel with you. We are ready to scout and bring in game, if you will supply us with other food.\" \"That\u0027s a bargain,\" the man said briefly, by no means sorry at the addition of strength to the fighting force. \"I reckon you will earn your grub. They say the Injuns air on the war-path.\" \"They are right enough there,\" Royce said. \"We have been engaged in a fight with a band of the Comanches who made a raid down on a little settlement named Gainsford, killed a score of settlers, and carried off five women. We got together a band from the ranche we were working on and went after them, and we had some pretty tough fighting before we got through.\" \"Waal, you will just suit us,\" the man said. \"I hear pretty near all the tribes are up, but I doubt whether they will venture to attack a party like this.\" \"I don\u0027t think they will if we keep together and are cautious,\" Royce said. \"You have forty waggons; that, at two men to a waggon, makes eighty.\" [270] \"That\u0027s so,\" the other agreed; \"and what with cooks and bosses and one thing and another, we mount up to pretty nigh a hundred, and of course every man has got a rifle along with him.\" \"That makes a strong party,\" Royce said, \"and with the advantage you will have of fighting from the cover of the waggons, I don\u0027t think the Red-skins would dare to attack you. We have got a pack animal along with us, as you see, with our blankets and things. We will hitch him to the tail of one of the waggons.\" The man nodded. \"I have got four teams here of my own,\" he said, \"and a spare man who cooks and so on for my outfit, so you may as well jine in with that. They air the last four waggons in the line.\" The journey occupied six weeks. They kept at first up the west fork of the Trinity River, crossing a patch of heavily timbered country. Then they struck the main fork of Brazos River and followed it for some distance; then took the track across to the Rio Pecos. It led them by a toilsome journey across an elevated and arid country without wood or water, save that which they obtained at the head-waters of the Double Mountain River and from four small streams which united lower down to form the north fork of the Colorado River. From this point until they reached the Pecos, a distance of over a hundred miles, there was no water. At ordinary times caravans would not have followed this route, but would have kept far to the north. But they would have been exposed to attacks by the Comanches and Utes, so in spite of their strength they thought it prudent to follow the longer and safer route. With a view to this journey across the desert each waggon carried an empty hogshead slung behind it. These were filled at the last springs, and the water, doled out sparingly, sufficed to enable the men and animals to subsist for the five days the [271] journey occupied, although the allowance was so small that the sufferings of the cattle were severe. Up to this time Hugh and Royce had succeeded almost daily in bringing a couple of stags into camp, but game was scarce in this parched and arid region, where not only water was wanting, but grass was scanty in the extreme, and the only sustenance for deer was the herbage of the scattered bushes. They therefore rode with the caravan, and aided it as far as they could. The waggons, which were of great size, were generally drawn by twelve oxen or mules, and in crossing the deep sand it was sometimes necessary to use the teams of two waggons to drag one over the sand-hills. Sometimes even this failed to move them, and the mounted men fastened their ropes to the spokes of the wheels, and so helped to get the waggons out of the holes into which they had sunk. \"I would rather run the risks of a fight with the Indians,\" Hugh said to Royce on the last day of their journey across the plain, \"than have to perform this frightful journey. The heat is simply awful, and I feel as if I could drink a bucket of water.\" \"You will get plenty of water to-night, Hugh. The Pecos is a good big river. I believe the animals smell it already. Look how hard they are pulling. The drivers crack their whips and shout as usual, but the beasts are doing their best without that. We have been very lucky that we have had no sand-storms or anything to delay us and confuse us as to the track. Waal, we are over the worst of the journey now; except the Guadalupe Pass there ain\u0027t much trouble between the Pecos and El Paso. Once there we are on the Rio Grande all the way up to Santa Fé.\" Towards the afternoon the ground became harder, and the animals quickened their pace almost to a trot, straining at the ropes with heaving flanks, while their tongues hanging out and their blood-shot eyes showed how they were suffering. An hour before sunset a shout broke from the men as, on ascending [272] a slight rise, the river lay before them. The instant they reached its bank and the animals were loosed, they rushed in a body into the stream and plunged their nostrils deeply into the water, while the men, ascending the banks a short distance, lay down at the edge of the stream and satisfied their thirst. Five minutes later all had stripped and were enjoying a bath. Hugh had been much struck with the difference between the teamsters and the cow-boys; the former did not wear the chaperajos or leather overalls with fringed seams, or the bright silk neck handkerchiefs or flat-brimmed hats of the cow-boys. Their attire was sober rather than bright. They wore soft hats, with slouched brims, and great cow-hide boots. There was none of that dashing, reckless air that characterized the cow-boys, or the quick alertness that showed the readiness to cope with any emergency that might occur. Nor in the camp at night was there any trace of the light-hearted gaiety which showed itself in song, laughter, and dance in the gatherings round the cow-boys\u0027 fires. They were for the most part silent and moody men, as if the dull and monotonous labour in which they were engaged, and the months of solitary journeying, with nothing to break the silence save the cracking of the whips and the shouts of encouragement to the animals, had left their mark upon them. Hugh and Royce agreed cordially that, with all its dangers and its unmeasured toil, they would infinitely prefer the life of a cow-boy, short as it might be, to that of a teamster, even with the prospect of acquiring a competence upon which to settle down in old age. Two days\u0027 halt was made on the banks of the Pecos to rest the foot-sore animals. Then the journey was recommenced, the river crossed at a shallow ford, and its banks followed until, after three days\u0027 journey, a small stream running in from the west was reached. Hence the route lay due west to El Paso. The country was flat until they reached the Guadalupe range of hills, which they crossed by a winding and difficult pass, each [273] waggon being taken up by three teams. Then skirting the Alimos Hills they crossed the Sierra Hueco by the pass of the same name, which was far easier than that of Guadalupe, and then one long day\u0027s march took them down to Fort Bliss, which stands on the Rio Grande, facing the town of El Paso. They had now arrived at the borders of civilization. Mexican villages and towns, and United States posts were scattered thickly along the course of the river all the way from El Paso up to Santa Fé. \"What air you thinking of doing, young fellow?\" the head of the party asked Hugh as they sat by the fire of the encampment a short distance out of El Paso. \"You see we shall kinder break up here. I go with my teams to the forts along the river, and then strike out east to the outlying posts. About half my freight is ammunition and such like. Waal, then, pretty nigh half the waggons go up to the mines. They have powder, tools, and machinery. One or two stay here. They bring hardware and store goods of all sorts for this town; the rest go up to Santa Fé. Now what air you thinking of doing? You can make up your mind to stay here, or you kin go up to Santa Fé. You told me you had a fancy for jinin\u0027 some prospecting party and going out west into Arizona. I doubt whether you will find anyone much bent on that job at present, seeing as how the Injuns is stirring, though I don\u0027t know that makes much difference, seeing they is always agin anyone going into what they calls their country. \"Anyhow, the miners will all have to work with a pick in one hand and a rifle in the other. You have got the Apaches here, and they air wuss than the Comanches. The Comanches have had to deal with western hunters and pioneers, and know that there ain\u0027t much to be got out of them but lead, so beyond stealing cattle they\u0027ve got into the way of being mostly quiet, though now and agin they break out, just as they have at present. Now the Apache has had to deal all along with [274] Mexicans, and he has pretty good reason for thinking that he is a much better fighter than the white man. He has been raiding on the Mexican villages for hundreds of years, burning and killing and carrying off their women and gals, and I guess thar is a pretty good sprinkling of Mexican blood in his veins, though that don\u0027t make him better or wuss, as far as I know. Still, take them altogether, they air the savagest and hardest tribe of Red-skins on this continent. \"However, if you like to go prospecting among thar hills and to run the risk of losing your scalp, that is your business; but if you do, this is the place to start from, and not Santa Fé. There is gold pretty nigh everywhere in the valley of the Gila, and that lies a bit to the north-west from here. At any rate, it seems to me that this is the place that you are most likely to fall in with parties starting out. But let me give you a warning, lad. You will find this town is pretty nigh full of gold-miners, and you won\u0027t find one of them who won\u0027t tell you that he knows of some place that\u0027s a sartin fortune up among the hills. Now, don\u0027t you believe them. Don\u0027t you go and put your money into any job like that. If you find a party being got up, and others think it good enough to jine, of course you can chip in, but don\u0027t you go and find the money for the whole show.\" \"There is no fear of that,\" Hugh laughed. \"I had about five-and-twenty pounds when I went on to the ranche, and I have got that and six months\u0027 pay in my belt. That won\u0027t go far towards fitting out an expedition.\" \"No, it won\u0027t,\" the teamster agreed. \"It will be enough for you to be able to chip in with the others, but, as you say, not to stand the whole racket. Waal, what do you think?\" \"I am very much obliged to you for your advice,\" Hugh said, \"and I think we can\u0027t do better than stay about here for a bit at any rate. What do you say, Royce?\" \"It is all one to me,\" Royce replied; \"but there is no doubt [275] that El Paso is as good a place as any, if not better, for looking round.\" \"Then that is settled, Bill; and to tell you the truth, I have had pretty nigh enough riding for the present, and sha\u0027n\u0027t be sorry for a fortnight\u0027s rest.\" \"Same here,\" Bill said. \"I feel as if I was getting part of the horse, and should like to get about on foot for a bit so as to feel that I hadn\u0027t quite lost the use of my legs.\" Accordingly the next morning they bade good-bye to their comrades of the last two months, and mounting, rode into El Paso. It was a town of some size, and purely Mexican in its features and appearance. The inhabitants almost all belonged to that nationality, but in the street were a considerable number of red-shirted miners and teamsters. Hugh and his companions rode to one of the principal haciendas, and handed over the three horses to a lounging Mexican. \"They have been fed this morning,\" Royce said. \"We will come in and give them some corn in two hours.\" \"I will see after Prince,\" Hugh said, patting his horse\u0027s neck. \"Don\u0027t you be afraid that I am going to leave you to the care of strangers. We have been together too long for that, old boy.\" They then went into the hotel, and ordered a room and breakfast. \"I don\u0027t care much for this Mexican stuff with its oil and garlic,\" Royce said as they had finished the meal. \"Don\u0027t you? I call it first-rate. After living on fried beef and broiled beef for over a year, it is a comfort to get hold of vegetables. These beans were delicious, and the coffee is a treat.\" \"It isn\u0027t bad for one meal,\" Royce admitted reluctantly, \"but you\u0027ll get pretty sick of Mexican cookery after a bit, and long for a chunk of plain beef hot from the fire.\" [276] \"Perhaps I shall,\" Hugh laughed, \"but I think it will be some little time first. Now let us take a stroll round the town.\" It was all new to Hugh. He had seen the Mexican women in their native dress in the villages among the hills, but here they indulged in much more finery than the peasant girls. The poblanas were all dressed in gay colours, with a scarf or rebozo over their heads, with gold pins and ornaments in their glossy black hair, and with earrings, necklaces, and generally bracelets of the same metal. No small share of a peasant\u0027s wealth is exhibited on the persons of his womankind. They wore short skirts, generally of red or green, trimmed with rows of black braid, while a snow-white petticoat below and a white chemisette partly hidden by a gay handkerchief over the shoulders completed the costume. They were almost all barefooted, but Hugh observed that their feet and ankles were exceedingly small and well formed, as were their hands and plump brown arms. Here and there were a good many of the upper class half shrouded in black mantles, wearing the Spanish mantilla, worn so as partly to conceal the face, though it needed but the slightest movement to draw it aside when they wished to recognize anyone they met. Most of these were on their way to a church, whose bell was pealing out a summons, and carried their mass-book in one hand and a fan in the other. Many a look of admiration was bestowed by the merry peasant girls upon Hugh as he walked along. He was now eighteen and had attained his full height, and his life on horseback gave an easy and lissom appearance to his tall, powerful figure. His work among the cattle had given to his face something of the keen, watchful expression that characterizes the cow-boys, but not to a sufficient extent to materially affect the frank, pleasant look that was his chief characteristic. His gray eyes, and the light-brown hair with the slight tinge of gold in it, typical of the hardy north-country race, were very [277] attractive to the dark-skinned Mexicans. He and his companions had both donned their best attire before leaving camp, and this differed but slightly from that of the Mexican vaqueros, and though sufficiently gay to attract general attention elsewhere, passed unnoticed at El Paso. The western cow-boy was not an unusual figure there, for many of those discharged during the winter were in the habit of working down upon the New Mexican ranches and taking temporary employment with the native cattle-raisers, by whom their services were much valued, especially where the ranches were in the neighbourhood of those worked by white cow-boys. These in any disputes as to cattle with the Mexican vaqueros were accustomed to carry matters with a high hand. But the white cow-boys in Mexican service were just as ready to fight for their employers\u0027 rights as were those on the American ranches, and the herds were safe from depredation when under their charge. There were many priests in the streets, and, numerous as they were, they were always saluted with the deepest respect by the peasant women. \"It is wonderful how much women think of their priests,\" Royce observed philosophically. \"Back east it used to make me pretty well sick, when I was a young chap, to hear them go on about their ministers; but these Mexican women go a lot farther. There is nothing they wouldn\u0027t do for these fat padres.\" \"No. But they are not all fat, Royce,\" Hugh said. \"I acknowledge they look for the most part plump and well-fed, and upon the best of terms with themselves, as well they may be, seeing how much they are respected.\" \"They have got a pretty easy life, I reckon,\" Royce said contemptuously. \"They have to say mass two or three times a day, sit in a box listening to the women\u0027s confessions, and fatten upon their gifts and offerings.\" \"At any rate, Royce, the people here are religious. See, there are as many peasants as peasant women going into that [278] church. Whatever may be said about it, religion goes for a good deal more in a Catholic country than in a Protestant. It is a pity there is not more religion among the cow-boys.\" \"How are we to get it?\" Royce protested. \"Once or twice a year a minister may arrive at a camp and preach, but that is about all. We always give him a fair show, and if any fellow wur to make a muss it would be worse for him. I don\u0027t say as cow-boys don\u0027t use pretty hard language among themselves, but I will say this, that if a minister or a woman comes to camp they will never hear a swear word if they stop there a week. No, sir. Cow-boys know how to behave when they like, and a woman might go through the ranches from end to end in Texas without being insulted.\" \"I know that, Royce. The point is, if they can go without using what you call swear words when a woman is among them, why can\u0027t they always do so?\" \"It is all very fine to talk, Hugh; but when you get on a bucking broncho that sends you flying about ten yards through the air, and you come down kerplump, I never seed a man yet as would pick himself up and speak as if he wur in a church. No, sir; it\u0027s not in human nature.\" When they got back to the hotel Hugh observed that questioning glances were cast at them by several men who were lounging about the steps. Royce observed it also. \"What have those fellows got in their heads, I wonder?\" he said. \"Do they reckon we are two bad, bold men who have been holding up some Mexican village, or do they take us for horse-thieves? There is something wrong, Hugh, you bet.\" \"They certainly didn\u0027t look friendly, Royce, though I am sure I don\u0027t know what it is about. You haven\u0027t been winking at any of their women, have you?\" \"G\u0027ar long with yer!\" Royce laughed. \"As if any of them would look at a little chap like me while I am walking along of you. If there has been any winking it\u0027s you as has done it.\" [279] \"I am quite innocent, Royce, I assure you. Still there is something wrong. Well, let us go and see that the horses are fed.\" There were five or six men in the yard. They were talking excitedly together when Hugh and his companion came out of the hotel, but they were at once silent, and stood looking at them as they crossed the yard and went into the stable. \"Thar\u0027s something wrong,\" Royce repeated. \"If my horse wur as good as yours, Hugh, I should say let\u0027s settle up quietly and ride out and make a bolt; but they would overtake me in no time.\" \"That would never do, Royce. I don\u0027t know what their suspicions are, but they would be confirmed if we were to try to escape, and if they overtook us the chances are they wouldn\u0027t give us much time for explanations.\" \"You are right there, Hugh. The Mexicans hates the whites. They know that one of us can lick any three of them, and it riles them pretty considerable. They don\u0027t give a white man much show if they get their hands on him.\" \"Well, it is no use worrying about it, Royce. I suppose we shall hear sooner or later what it is all about.\" Passing through the hotel they took their seats at some tables placed in the shade in front of the house, and there sat smoking and talking for some time. \"If those fellows round the door keep on looking at us much longer,\" Royce said, \"I shall get up and ask them what they mean.\" \"Don\u0027t do that, Royce. It would only bring on a fight; that is no use here.\" \"Waal,\" Royce said doggedly, \"I haven\u0027t got to sit here to be stared at, and some of them fellows is going to get wiped out if they go on at it.\" \"We are sure to hear before long, Royce. See, there is a knot of four or five fellows in uniform at the other end of the [280] square. I suppose that they are a sort of policemen. I have seen them looking this way. You will see they are going to arrest us presently, and then, I suppose, we shall hear all about it.\" \"I wish we had Broncho Harry and the rest of our outfit here,\" Royce said. \"We would clear out the whole town.\" Half an hour later there was a clatter of horses\u0027 hoofs, and two gentlemen, followed by half a dozen Mexican vaqueros, rode into the square and made straight for the hotel. Simultaneously the guardians of the peace moved across the square, and there was a stir among the loungers at the entrance to the hotel. \"The affair is coming to a crisis, Royce!\" One of the Mexicans was an elderly man, the other a lad seventeen or eighteen years old. The latter dismounted and entered the hotel. In two minutes he reappeared and spoke to the other, who also dismounted, and after a word or two with one of the men belonging to the hotel, and a short conversation with the leader of the party of civil guards, advanced to the table at which Hugh and Royce were sitting. He saluted them as they rose to their feet. Hugh returned the salutation. \"Se?ors,\" he said courteously, in very fair English, \"you have, I understand, just arrived here, having accompanied a waggon-train across the deserts from Texas.\" \"It is perfectly true, se?or,\" Hugh replied. \"Is there anything unusual in our doing so?\" \"By no means,\" the Mexican said. \"The matter that concerns me is that one of you is riding a horse which belonged to my son, Don Estafan Perales.\" \"You mean the bay?\" The Mexican made a gesture of assent. \"I purchased that horse at M\u0027Kinney, a small town in the north-east of Texas.\" \"May I ask who you purchased it from?\" [281] \"Certainly, se?or. It must have passed from the hands of your son before it was offered for sale to me. I bought it from two men whom I had never seen before.\" A little crowd had gathered behind the Mexican, and at this answer there were exclamations of \"A likely story that!\" and \"Death to the horse-thieves!\" Two men in mining costume, the one a tall, powerfully-built man some fifty years old, the other small and of slight figure, with snow-white hair, who had just strolled up, separated themselves from the rest and ranged themselves by Hugh\u0027s side, the big man saying in Mexican: \"Softly, se?ores, softly. You ain\u0027t neither judges nor jury on this case, and me and my mate is going to see fair-play.\" \"There is no intention, se?or, of doing anything unfair,\" the Mexican said. \"The matter is a simple one. These strangers have just ridden in here with a horse belonging to my son. He started from here with three servants and a party going to Texas. This was upwards of eighteen months ago. He had business at New York. His intention was to spend a few weeks in Texas hunting, then to proceed to the nearest railway-station and take train to New York. From the time he started we have never heard from him. Some members of the party he accompanied have long since returned. It seems that he accompanied them until they had passed the Bad Lands, and then left them to carry out his intention of hunting. We have never heard of him since. He certainly has never arrived at New York. And now that these strangers arrive here with his horse, which was recognized as soon as it entered the stables, I have a right to inquire how they obtained it.\" \"Surely, se?or,\" Hugh said. \"The men from whom I bought it were, as I said, strangers. They were two very doubtful-looking characters, and as they appeared very anxious to sell the horse, and were willing to part with it considerably under its value, my opinion was that undoubtedly they had not become possessed of it honestly. My friend here was with me at the [282] time, and the only terms upon which I would purchase it and a pack-horse they had also to sell, were that they should give me a formal receipt signed in the presence of the sheriff and judge, in order that, should I at any time come across the owner of the animal, I should be in a position to prove that I at least had come by it honestly. That receipt I have here;\" and taking a small leather letter-case from his pocket he produced the receipt. \"There are the signatures, se?or, and the official stamps of the writers, and you will see that they testify also to their personal knowledge of me as a resident of the town. I may add that it is certain that had I been an accomplice of the thieves I should have taken good care not to bring the horse to a locality where he would be at once recognized.\" The Mexican glanced through the paper. \"That is perfectly satisfactory, se?or, and I must apologize for having for a moment entertained suspicions of you. Explain this, Carlos,\" he said to his son. \"I would have further talk with these gentlemen.\" The young Mexican translated in his own language the effect of what had passed, and the little crowd speedily dispersed, several having walked away as soon as the two miners sided with the accused, as a fray with four determined men armed with revolvers was not to be lightly entered upon. The miners were also turning away when Hugh said to the Mexican, \"Excuse me a moment, se?or.\" \"Thank you greatly,\" he went on, turning to the miners, \"for siding with us. We are strangers here. Will you let us see you again, and have a talk with you? At present, as you see, this gentleman, who has lost his son, who has most probably been murdered by these horse-thieves, wants to question me. Do me the favour to come in this evening and drink a bottle of wine with us, when we can again thank you for your aid.\" \"There are no thanks due,\" the bigger of the two men said. [283] \"Me and my mate know nothing of the affair, but seeing two of our own colour facing a lot of these Mexikins we naturally ranged up alongside of you to see fair-play. But as you are strangers, and we have nothing particular to do, I don\u0027t mind if we come in and have a talk this evening. Eh, mate?\" The little man nodded, and the two walked off together. Hugh then turned to the Mexican. \"Now, se?or, we are at your service.\" \"Se?ors,\" he said courteously, \"my name is Don Ramon Perales. My hacienda lies three miles away; this is scarcely a place for quiet conversation. I am anxious to learn all particulars that you can give me as to the men from whom you bought the horse. May I ask if you would mount your horses and ride back with me?\" \"With pleasure, se?or,\" Hugh said. \"Our time is entirely our own, and I can readily understand your anxiety to hear all you can about this matter.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3127/85995.html","bookId":897,"book":{"id":897,"title":"Redskin and Cow-Boy","description":"简介： Cedar Gulch was, in 1851, a flourishing camp.
