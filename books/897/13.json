{"id":33793,"no":13,"title":"CHAPTER XII. AN INDIAN RAID.","content":"THE cow-boys were all mounted on horses that had not been worked for some days. Hugh was on Prince, and they got over the ground at great speed, arriving before sunset at the ruined village. There were three or four men, seven or eight women, and as many children gathered when they rode in. The men had been absent when the attack took place, the women had escaped by seizing their children and rushing out at the backs of the houses and hiding among the rocks and bushes, as soon as the yells of the Indians and the explosion of the firearms burst upon their ears. \"We heard you was coming,\" one of the men said; \"but I fear it is too late; they have got too far a start altogether.\" \"We didn\u0027t waste a minute,\" Broncho Harry said; \"we wur in the saddle three minutes after Tom brought us the news, and we have rode seventy miles since. Tom has done a hundred and forty since last night. Where is Steve Rutherford? has he been wiped out?\" \"No; he wur away after a bunch of horses that had strayed. He wur camping out twenty mile away when he saw the light and guessed what it wur; he drove the horses in before him, feeling sure as he would be too late to do any good, but reckoning that they might be useful.\" \"Good man,\" Broncho said; \"but where is he?\" \"He went on alone after them,\" the man said. \"Some of us would have gone with him, but he reckoned he had best go alone; thar wurn\u0027t enough of us to fight; he allowed that you [207] boys would be here presently, for the young un here told us as Tom had ridden off with the news. Rube Garston and Jim Gattling rid off an hour later, and I reckon they will bring a few more up before morning; may be sooner.\" \"How many horses are there?\" \"Fifteen of the old man\u0027s, I reckon. They are in that corral behind his house, and I guess we have got as many more between us.\" \"Then there are enough to mount us ten and as many more,\" Broncho Harry said. \"Ours ain\u0027t good for no more travel to-night. Waal, we will just eat a bit, and then we shall be ready to go on. How many air there of you?\" \"Six here.\" \"Waal, that makes sixteen. I see three of you have got rifles, and four of us have brought rifles along with us. The only question is, which way have the red devils ridden? It air no use our following them if we haven\u0027t a clue of some sort. I reckon Steve will be here before long; that is what he has gone for. He would know he couldn\u0027t do any good himself, and he would be pretty well sure as we couldn\u0027t gather here in any such force as could enter the Injun country afore this evening.\" \"He took a lantern with him,\" one of the boys said. \"Yes, that is it. I guess he followed on foot till daylight, then he mounted and went on their trail until he could give a pretty good guess as to where they was heading; then I allow he will come back to tell us; that is how I read it.\" \"I expect you are right, Broncho. He didn\u0027t say much when he started; but when we talked of going with him he said, \u0027Just you stop where you are, there ain\u0027t anything you can do; we can\u0027t fight them till we get help. You just wait right here, boys.\u0027 It wur rather rough on us, when our gals are being carried off and our wives have been killed, and the hull place ruined; but we knew as Steve knew a sight more about Injuns than we did, and had been many a time into the heart of the Injun country afore they broke out, so we waited. But I tell [208] you, Harry, it wur hard work to sit quiet and know that them murdering villains was getting further away every hour.\" \"We will have them yet!\" Harry said confidently. \"If the old man don\u0027t ride up in another half-hour we will start. We will follow the trail as far as we can with lanterns. If we get to any place where the trail branches, then there will be nothing to do but to wait for Steve. Have yer eaten? because if not, yer had best fill up. It air no use starting on such a job as this fasting. We shall have need of all our strength afore we have done, you can bet your boots!\" None of the men had, in fact, eaten anything since the preceding night, but they saw the justice of the advice. \"There is some sheep up behind my place,\" one of them said. \"Like enough they was up on the hills when the Injuns came, but I saw some of them go in there this morning. There ain\u0027t no time for cooking now, so we will share your grub, and I will shoot three or four of the sheep and cut them up. They will last us for two or three days.\" \"That is a good idee; and if there is any flour as hasn\u0027t been carried off, you had best make up a few lots of five or six pounds each and tie them up in cloths. They will come in mighty handy. Hello! here are some more of the boys!\" A minute later eight more cow-boys rode up. \"Hello, Broncho! I thought we should find your crowd here. We have ridden all we knew to be here in time to go on with you—that is, if you are going on.\" \"We are going on as far as we can, Ike; we are just changing horses. I think there are about enough left to give you one each.\" \"Have you any news which way the Red-skins have gone?\" \"Not yet. Old man Rutherford followed \u0027em up. I expect he will be here soon; if not, we shall meet him. They have got twenty hours\u0027 start—that is the worst of it. No, there ain\u0027t no chance of overtaking them, that is sartin. What we have got to do is to wipe some of them out, and to give them a lesson, and get the girls back again if we can; and we have [209] got to do it quick, else we shall have the hull Injun country up agin us.\" \"I did not think that they would have done it,\" another man said. \"The old man wur always good friends with the Injuns, and made them welcome when they came along.\" \"It ain\u0027t no good being kind to Injuns,\" another put in. \"There ain\u0027t no gratitude in them.\" \"Injuns air pison!\" Broncho said; and a general murmur of agreement expressed that in the opinion of the cow-boys this summed up the characteristics of the Red-skins. In a few minutes the new-comers were provided with fresh horses. A spare horse was taken on for Rutherford, and then, headed by the survivors of the raid, the party started three-and-twenty strong. They travelled fast; not that there was any occasion for speed, but because every man was burning with the desire to get at the enemy. After riding about twenty miles they checked their horses, for a fire was seen a short distance ahead. \"That\u0027s all right,\" one of the settlers said. \"That will be Rutherford, sure enough. It is just there where the valley forks. He is waiting there for us. He would know we shouldn\u0027t want a guide as far as this.\" As they came up a tall figure rose from beside the fire. \"Well, Steve, have you tracked them?\" Jim Gattling, the youngest of the party from the village, asked eagerly. \"They have gone over the divide into the Springer Valley, have followed that some way, and then through the little ca?on, and up towards the head-waters of the Pequinah Creek. I only went through the ca?on to see which way they turned, and then made back here. I guessed some of you would be coming along about this time.\" \"Was they riding fast?\" \"No. They halted here for some hours. I reckon they had ridden a long way afore they attacked our place. I saw their fires some time afore I got to them, or I might have walked into them, for I didn\u0027t think they would have halted so soon. I [210] tied the hoss up and scouted round \u0027em and when they started this morning before daylight took up the trail after them. They weren\u0027t travelling very fast. You see they had got about a hundred head of cattle with them, and I reckon they have three or four days\u0027 journey before them. As far as I could make out, from what I seed of them, they don\u0027t belong to this part at all. Sartin they was going easy, and didn\u0027t reckon on being followed. It ain\u0027t often they get chased when they are once in the hills. Waal, boys, I am glad to see you, and I thank ye all. It is what I expected from yer, for I felt sure that when you got the news you would muster up.\" \"We have brought a fresh horse for you, Steve,\" Jim Gattling said. \"We druv in a herd this afternoon, and they all changed back there, so we are ready to ride at once.\" \"That\u0027s good, Jim! I was wondering over that, and thinking that if yours had come in from the plains they wouldn\u0027t be fit for any more travel to-night, for I knew they was a long way out. Where wur you, Broncho?\" \"We wur on Little Creek.\" \"Ah! that\u0027s about sixty miles away from our place. Waal, boys, we may as well go on over the divide and down into the valley; there we had best camp. You will have done a hundred miles by then, and will want sleep. Besides, we mustn\u0027t knock the hosses up; they have got their work before them, and maybe we shall have to ride on our way back.\" \"How many of the skunks are there?\" \"Over forty.\" \"We sha\u0027n\u0027t have much trouble with that lot,\" Broncho Harry said. \"Not if we catch them before they git to their village, Broncho. But I doubt whether we shall do that.\" \"Waal, we will fight them, Steve, if there was four hundred of them!\" Harry said. \"We have come to get your Rosie and the others back, and we are going to do it, you bet.\" Rutherford held out his hand and gripped that of the cow-boy; then, mounting the horse that had been brought for [211] him, he took his place at the head of the party and led the way. It was a toilsome journey over the shoulder that divided the two valleys. The pace was necessarily confined to a walk, and it was five hours before they reached the stream upon which they were to camp. Here the horses were turned loose to graze, and the men threw themselves down upon the ground and were soon asleep, for it was now past midnight. With the dawn of day they were on their feet again, a great fire lighted, and some of the mutton cut up and cooked, and some cakes baked. As soon as the meal was eaten they again started. Hugh had not changed his horse at the village. Broncho Harry told him that it was not likely they would travel for many hours that evening, and he knew that Prince, who had had an easy time of it lately, could easily do this, and he greatly preferred keeping him, for he felt that upon such an expedition as this his speed might be of the greatest utility. A rapid ride of ten miles up the valley took them to the mouth of the ca?on, which came into the main valley at a sharp angle. It was wide at the entrance, but soon narrowed down into a gorge from ten to twenty feet wide, with rocks rising precipitously on both sides. It was evident by the smoothly-worn face that in the wet season a tremendous torrent rushed down, filling it thirty or forty feet deep; but it was perfectly dry now, and for the most part they were able to ride at a fair pace. Here and there, however, masses of rock had fallen down from above since the last rains, and here they had to dismount and allow the horses to clamber over by themselves as best they could. At such spots scratches upon the face of the stones showed where the party they were pursuing had passed on the previous day. The ca?on was upwards of a mile in length, and the valley into which it led was some hundreds of feet higher than that which they had left. As soon as they emerged from the pass they put their horses into a gallop, the track of the party before [212] them being plainly visible. As they got deeper among the mountains the scenery became very wild. Forests clothed the hills. Great masses of rock towered above the valley, and huge blocks of stone encumbered the route they had to pursue. Sometimes the track left the bottom and wound up the hillside, passing at times along the ledges, with precipices above and below. Anxious as they were to press forward, much of the journey had to be performed at a foot-pace, for many of the horses having been brought up on the plains all their lives were fidgety and nervous on such unaccustomed ground, and required coaxing and care to get them along the passes. They travelled until late in the afternoon and then halted. The next day\u0027s work was of the same character. They were now high up among the hills, and Steve told them that they were near the crest of the range. \"We had better stop here,\" Rutherford said about three o\u0027clock in the afternoon, as they arrived at a little stream. \"We mustn\u0027t knock the critters up; they have done a good day\u0027s work already.\" \"We have gained upon them, Steve,\" Broncho Harry said. \"The traces have been getting fresher.\" \"Yes, we have gained a bit, but not very much. Their horses would go faster than ours, because they are accustomed to the mountains; but the cattle will have kept them back. Why I stop here is because there is a sort of wall of rock with a passage up through it a mile or two ahead, and though I don\u0027t expect they have any idea they are followed, they are like enough to have left a sentry on the top of that wall. It \u0027ud never do for them to attack us here; we should have no show at all. I want to get my girl back, but throwing away our lives ain\u0027t the way to do it. Be careful how you pick the wood for the fires, boys: we mustn\u0027t let any smoke go curling up. You have got to see that every bit you put on is as dry as a chip.\" \"How on earth do the Indians manage to live among these hills?\" Hugh asked, after the meal had been cooked and eaten. [213] \"The country is different on the other side,\" Jim Gattling said. \"We are pretty nearly up to the top of the divide now, and on the other side the slopes are much more gradual. They have plenty of ranges where they have got cattle and sheep. But I don\u0027t know nothing about the country here. Steve has been over, but there ain\u0027t many as has.\" \"Yes,\" Rutherford said, \"it is as Jim says. There is a wide sort of plateau, with big valleys down to the Canadian. We ain\u0027t very far now from the frontier of New Mexico, and from the top of the hills here you can see the Spanish peaks a hundred and fifty miles away. I reckon we may have to go down that side. There are a heap of Injun villages up here, and though we may thrash the lot ahead of us they would gather pretty thick in a short time, and like enough cut us off going back, for they know the tracks better than we do, and their horses would go at a gallop along places where we should have to drag ours. Going down the other way we can ride as fast as they can, and when we once get down in the valley of the Canadian we shall get help at the ranches there.\" \"That will certainly be the best way, Steve,\" Broncho Harry said. \"We are all ready to fight any number of them on the plains, but it wouldn\u0027t be good to be hemmed up among these hills with no chance of help. We could keep them off, I reckon, till we had eaten our boots, but they would make an end of us at last, sure. Have you often been along this line before, Steve?\" \"Once. I came across here with a party of Red-skins just after the last peace wur made with them, when it was sure that they wouldn\u0027t break out again until they had got their presents. I had got a stock of beads, and looking-glasses and cottons, and such like, and went up with a couple of mules and traded among them for skins, and worked robes and moccasins and Indian trumpery. I sent them back east, and did a pretty good trade with them. But I know the other side well. I was ranching two years down on the Canadian, and we had two or three fights with the Red-skins, who was pretty troublesome [214] about that time. There weren\u0027t many ranches down there then, and we had to look pretty spry to keep the har on our heads.\" \"And how do you propose to work it now, Steve?\" \"Well, I reckon that if they have got a sentry on them rocks I spoke of he won\u0027t stay there after dark, and that the danger will be at the other end of the pass. Like enough, there will be one or two of them there. I reckon the best plan will be for me and Jim Gattling and a kipple of others to go on ahead quiet. If we find any of the skunks there, in course we shall wipe them out. When we have done that the rest can come up the pass. It ain\u0027t no place for anyone as doesn\u0027t know every foot of the way to come up in the dark; and you must make torches, ready to light up, when one of us goes back with the news that the pass is clear. As soon as we have done with the Red-skins, Jim and I will go off scouting. You see we don\u0027t know yet what band this is, or how far their village is away. We will follow on the trail, and when the rest get up through the pass they must just wait till we bring them word. I reckon, from their coming by this road, as their place is about fifteen mile from the top of the pass. There is a big village there, and I expect they belong to it. I reckon they are just getting there now, and they will be feasting pretty considerable to-night. It air a pity we ain\u0027t handy. However, it cannot be helped. We should risk it all if we was to try to push on afore it got dark.\" \"Your plan seems to pan out all right, Steve. Who will you take with you?\" \"Waal, you and Long Tom may as well come, Broncho, though, I reckon, it don\u0027t make much difference, for you all means fighting.\" As soon as it became dusk the party again moved forward. \"That\u0027s the rock,\" Rutherford said, pointing to a long dark line that rose up before them. \"They can\u0027t see us here, and I reckon if there wur a scout there he has moved off before this. Now, do you other fellows take our critters and just move on slowly. You see that point sticking up above the [215] line. Waal, that is on one side of the pass; so you just make for that, and stop when you get there till one of us comes back.\" The torches had been prepared during the halt, two or three young pitch-pines having been cut down and split up for the purpose. The four scouts moved off at a quick walk, and the rest of the party picked their way along slowly and cautiously towards the point Steve had indicated. They had some little trouble in finding the entrance to the pass, but when they discovered it they threw the bridles on their horses\u0027 necks and dismounted. The time went slowly, but it was not more than two hours before they heard a slight noise up the pass, and a minute or two later a footfall. \"Is that you, Broncho?\" Hugh asked. \"No, it air me; but it is all the same thing, I reckon. Jehoshaphat! but I have knocked myself pretty nigh to pieces among them blessed rocks. It air just as dark as a cave; there ain\u0027t no seeing your hand.\" \"Well, is it all right, Tom?\" \"No, it ain\u0027t gone off right. When we got to the top of the pass there wur two Red-skins sitting at a fire. We come along as quiet as we could, but just as we got in sight of them I suppose they heard something, for they both jumped on to their feet and wur out of sight like a streak of lightning. We waited without moving for half an hour, and then they came back again. We could have shot, but Steve reckoned it was too great a risk; so he and Jim undertook to crawl forward while Broncho and me wur to keep ready to shoot if the Redskins made a bolt. It wur a long time, or at least seemed so. The Red-skins was restless, and we could see they was on the listen. Waal, at last up they both jumped; but it wur too late. Steve and Jim fired and down they both went, and we came on. The wust of the business wur, that one of their hosses broke loose and bolted. Steve fired after him. He may have hit him, or he may not; anyhow he went off. So now you have got to hurry up all you know.\" [216] The torches were at once lit, and leading their horses the party made their way up the gorge. It was steep and narrow, and encumbered with boulders; but in half an hour they reached the other end. Broncho Harry was awaiting them. \"We have got to move away to the right for about half a mile and stop there. There is a clump of trees, and that is where we are to wait. It air a \u0027tarnal bad business that air hoss getting away. He is pretty sure to bring the Injuns down on us. Steve ain\u0027t going very far. He sez there is another village about three miles from the one he thinks most likely; and when he gets about four miles away from here he will be able to see which way the tracks go, and then he will come straight back to the trees.\" \"Do you think you hit the horse, Harry?\" Hugh asked as they made their way to the clump of trees. \"You don\u0027t suppose I could miss a horse if I tried, Hugh. I hit him sure enough, worse luck. If I had missed him it wouldn\u0027t have mattered so much. If he came galloping in by himself they might have thought he had got scared at something—by a bar, perhaps—and had just made tracks for the camp. Like enough they would have sent off four men to see if it wur all right; but when the blessed thing turns up with a bullet in his hide, they will know there has been a fight.\" \"What do you think they will do then, Harry? Are they likely to ride out in force to the gap?\" \"They may, and they may not. I should say they won\u0027t. I should guess they\u0027ll just throw out scouts all round their village and wait till morning. They won\u0027t know how strong our party is, and wouldn\u0027t take the risk of being ambushed in the dark.\" \"Perhaps when the horse goes in they won\u0027t notice it, especially as they will be feasting and dancing.\" \"I don\u0027t reckon that worth a cent, Hugh. There are safe to be one or two of their boys out looking after the horses; besides, those varmints\u0027 ears are always open. They would hear a horse coming at a gallop across the plain half a mile away, aye, and [217] more than that. Directly the boy sees the horse is saddled he will run in and tell them, then they will take it in by the fire and look at it. When they see the mark I have made on it there will be a nice rumpus, you bet. They will know what it means just as if it wur all writ down for them.\" Two hours passed, and then the sound of an approaching horse was heard. \"Well, Steve, what news?\" \"The horse has gone on straight for the village—the one we thought—and all the other tracks go in that direction. There ain\u0027t no chance of taking them by surprise now.\" \"What do you think they will do, Steve?\" \"They will just watch all night, that is sartin, and in the morning two or three will be sent out to scout. There ain\u0027t many trees about here, and they will reckon that they can see us as soon as we see them; and those they send out are safe to be on the best horses they have got. In course we could lie down there by the gap and shoot them when they come up; but I don\u0027t see as that would do us any good. When they didn\u0027t get back it would only put the others more on their guard than ever. If we don\u0027t shoot them they will find our tracks here, and take back news how many we are. I tell you, lads, look at it as I will, I don\u0027t see no way out of it; and what makes it wuss is, when they take back news that the scouts they left here have both been shot, it will go mighty hard with the captives in the village. I can\u0027t see no way out of the kink anyhow. I am ready to give my life cheerful for Rosie, but I ain\u0027t going to ask you to give your lives when I don\u0027t see as there is any chance of getting her. Do you see any way out of the job, Broncho?\" \"I don\u0027t, Steve. As you say, there was about forty or fifty of these varmint in the expedition, and we may reckon there will be as many more able to draw a trigger in the village. That makes eighty. Four to one is pretty long odds. If they was out in the plain we might be a match for them, but to attack an Injun camp that\u0027s waiting and ready ain\u0027t the same [218] thing as fighting in the plains. Half of us would go down before we got in, and there would not be no more chance of the rest of us getting the captives away than there would if they was in the moon. If it hadn\u0027t been for this affair of the hoss we might have carried out your plans, and you might have made your way into the village; and there wur just the chance that yer might have got them out and brought them along to some likely place where we was handy; but there ain\u0027t no need to talk about that now. They will be guarded that strict that a bird couldn\u0027t get to them with a message. That ain\u0027t to be thought of. Can any of you boys think of anything?\" No one spoke. Then Hugh said: \"I am only a young hand yet, and I don\u0027t know that my ideas are worth anything, but I will tell you what they are, and then you can improve upon them perhaps. It seems to me that, in the first place, we ought to leave say four men at the gap. If four Indian scouts come out they ought to shoot or rope three of them, and let the fourth escape. If there were only two of them I would let one get away.\" \"What should they do that for, Hugh?\" Broncho Harry asked in surprise. \"I will tell you directly, Broncho. All the rest of us except the four who are left on watch should start at once and make a big circuit, and come round to the other side of the village, and stop a mile or so away in hiding; at any rate, as near as we can get. Why I propose letting one go is this. Suppose three or four scouts go out and none return, the Indians will be sure that they have fallen in a trap somewhere. They won\u0027t know how strong we are, or whether we think of making an attack on their village, and they will stop there expecting us for days perhaps, and then send out scouts again. Now, if one gets back with the news that they saw no signs of us until they got close to the gap, and then three or four shots were fired and his comrades were killed, but he got off without being pursued, it seems to me that they would naturally imagine that [219] there was only a small party at the gap—perhaps three or four men from the village they attacked, who had come out to revenge themselves—and would send out a strong party of their braves at once to attack them. Of course the four men left at the gap would, directly they had done their work, and the Indian was out of sight, mount their horses and make the same circuit as we had done, and join us as quickly as they could. We should be keeping watch, and after seeing the war party ride off we could dash straight down into the village. Half, and perhaps more than half, of their fighting men will have gone, and the others, making sure that we were still at the gap, and that there was no fear of attack, will be careless, and we should be pretty well into the village before a shot was fired.\" \"Shake, young fellow!\" Steve Rutherford said, holding out his hand to Hugh. \"That air a judgematical plan, and if it don\u0027t succeed it ought ter.\" There was a general chorus of assent. \"It beats me altogether,\" Steve went on, \"how yer should have hit on a plan like that when I, who have been fighting Injuns off and on for the last twenty years, couldn\u0027t see my way no more than if I had been a mole. You may be young on the plains, Lightning, fur so I have heard them call yer, but yer couldn\u0027t have reasoned it out better if yer had been at it fifty years. I tell you, young fellow, if I get my Rosie back agin it will be thanks to you, and if the time comes as yer want a man to stand by yer to the death yer can count Steve Rutherford in.\" \"And Jim Gattling,\" the young settler said. \"Rosie and me wur going to get hitched next month, and it don\u0027t need no talk to tell yer what I feels about it.\" \"Which of us shall stay, and which of us shall go?\" Broncho Harry said. \"You are the only man as knows the country, Steve; so you must go sartin. Long Tom and me will stay here if you like. You can give me the general direction of the village, and I expect I can make shift to come round and [220] join you. Besides, there will be your trail to follow. I don\u0027t reckon they will send out those scouts till daylight. Anyhow, we won\u0027t start before that, and we are safe to be able to follow your trail then. Who will stop with us? Will you stay, Hugh?\" \"No!\" Hugh said decidedly; \"I will go with Steve. I am not a very sure shot with the rifle.\" \"You can shoot straight enough,\" Broncho Harry said. \"Well, perhaps it isn\u0027t that, Harry; but so far I have had no Indian fighting, and though I am quite ready to go in and do my share in a fight, I tell you fairly that I couldn\u0027t shoot men down, however hostile, in cold blood.\" \"All right, Hugh. You sha\u0027n\u0027t stay with us. When you know the Injuns as well as we do, and know that mercy ain\u0027t a thing as ever enters their minds, and that they murders women and children in cold blood, and that if they do take a prisoner it is just to torture him until he dies, you won\u0027t feel that way.\" \"I will stay with you, Broncho,\" Jim Gattling said. \"I have just seen my house burnt and the best part of my stock carried away, and a dozen or more of my friends killed or scalped, and you bet I would kill a Red-skin at sight just as I would put my heel on a rattlesnake.\" Another of the party also volunteered to stay at the gap. No further words were necessary. The party mounted. \"That is where the village lies, Broncho; just about under that star. It is about fifteen mile, as I told you, on a straight line. We shall keep over there to the right, and in a couple of miles we shall get to where the ground falls, and will travel along there. You can\u0027t be wrong if you keep down on the slope. There air no chance then of your being seen. I don\u0027t know just where we shall turn off. There are several dips run down from above, and we shall follow one of them up when I reckon we have got a mile or two beyond the village. So keep a sharp look-out for our trail there. You needn\u0027t bother much about it before, because you can\u0027t miss the way; but look sharp at the turnings. I would drop something to show you where [221] we turn off, but if any Injun happened to come along he would be safe to notice it. When you guess you have ridden far enough keep a sharp look-out for the place when we turn off, and then follow the trail careful. It is rolling ground, that side of the village, and I reckon we kin get within half a mile of it. There ain\u0027t much fear of their wandering about, and any scouts they have out won\u0027t be on that side. So long!\" Steve Rutherford led the way. \"There ain\u0027t no need to hurry,\" he said. \"We have got plenty of time, and I reckon that when we get a bit further we will dismount and lead the horses. They have had pretty hard work coming up the hills, and I tell you they are likely to want all their speed to-morrow, and some of them will have to carry double if we can\u0027t manage to get hold of a few of the Injun ponies.\" Accordingly, after riding for half an hour, the party dismounted, and led their horses for a long distance. This was a novel exercise to the cow-boys, for it is rare for one of them to walk a hundred yards. A horse stands ever ready at hand, and if it be only to go down to the stream hard by to fetch a bucket of water the cow-boy will always throw his leg over his horse. But all felt the justice of Steve\u0027s remarks. They knew that they had at least a hundred-mile ride before they could hope to meet friends, and that the pursuit would be hot. It was therefore of vital importance that the horses should start as fresh as possible. After three hours\u0027 walking they mounted again, and continued their way until Steve Rutherford said that he thought they had gone far enough now. The moon had risen at two o\u0027clock, and its light had enabled them to travel fast since they had remounted. Turning up a hollow they followed it for about two miles, and then found they were entering a hilly and rugged country. \"Here we are,\" Steve said. \"The village lies at the foot of these rocks. I don\u0027t know how far along it may be, but I am right sure that we have got beyond it. Now, boys, you can sleep till daylight. I will keep watch, and see that none of the horses stray.\" [222] In a very few minutes all was quiet in the little valley, save for the sound of the horses cropping the short grass. At the first gleam of daylight Rutherford stirred up one of the sleepers. \"I am going to scout,\" he said. \"When the others wake tell them to be sure not to stir out of this dip, and to mind that the horses don\u0027t show on the sky-line. The Injuns will be keeping their eyes open this morning, and if they caught sight of one of them critters it would just spoil the hull plan.\" Rutherford was gone two hours. Long before his return all the men were up and about. Bill Royce had gone a little farther up the valley, which narrowed to a ravine, and, climbing the rocks cautiously, had taken a survey of the country. \"No signs of the village,\" he said when he returned, \"and no signs of Injuns as far as I can see. So I think, if we go up to the head of this gulch, it\u0027ll be safe to make a fire and cook the rest of our meat. There ain\u0027t more than enough for one more feed. After that I reckon we shall have to take to horse-flesh. Now, half of us will go up and cook, and the other half keep watch here. We may have Steve coming back with twenty Red-skins on his track.\" Just as they had fried their meat Steve returned. \"We are about three miles from the village,\" he said, \"but keeping along at the foot of the hills we can get to within half a mile of it safe. Beyond that it is a chance. What are you doing?\" \"Cooking.\" \"Well, one must eat, but the sooner we get on the better. We want to watch how things go.\" As soon as the meal was finished the party mounted, and, keeping close to the foot of the hill, rode on till Steve said, \"We cannot go beyond that next bluff; so turn up this gulch. I looked in, and there is good feed for the horses there. You had better look round when you get in to see as there ain\u0027t no bar or nothing to scare the horses, and two of yer had best stay on guard here at the mouth. Ef one of them critters wur to [223] get loose and to scoot out below there our lives wouldn\u0027t be worth a red cent. Now, Stumpy, you and Owen and me will go up over there. From among them bushes just at the foot of the rock we can see the camp, and we will take it by turns to keep watch. If you others will take my advice you will all get as much sleep as you can till we come for you, but mind, keep two on guard here.\" \"Can I come with you, Steve?\" Hugh asked. \"I don\u0027t feel like sleep at all.\" \"You can take my place, Lightning,\" Royce said. \"I ain\u0027t in no hurry to look at the Injuns. I expect I shall see plenty of them afore we have done.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3127/85992.html","bookId":897,"book":{"id":897,"title":"Redskin and Cow-Boy","description":"简介： Cedar Gulch was, in 1851, a flourishing camp.
