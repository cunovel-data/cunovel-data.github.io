{"id":33797,"no":17,"title":"CHAPTER XVI. A MINING EXPEDITION.","content":"IN a few minutes Hugh and Royce remounted and joined the two two Mexican gentlemen, and set out, with the party of vaqueros riding behind them. \"You came in with quite a strong force, Don Ramon,\" Hugh said smiling. \"It might have been necessary,\" the Mexican replied. \"I could not tell with whom I had to deal. Our guard do not care very much about risking their skins, especially when it is a question of Texan cow-boys, who have, if you will excuse my saying so, a terrible reputation, and can use their pistols with a skill that is extraordinary. I could not guess that I had to do with gentlemen.\" \"There is nothing that way about me, se?or!\" Royce said abruptly. \"I am a cow-boy, or a teamster, or a miner, or anything that comes to hand, but nary a claim to be a gentleman.\" \"My friend is a good fellow, se?or, in every way,\" Hugh said, \"and is my staunch and true friend. I myself am an Englishman who has come out to enjoy the hunting and the rough life of the plains of the West for a few years before settling down at home.\" \"And now, se?or,\" the Mexican said with a bow, \"will you let me begin to question you, for I am full of anxiety as to my unfortunate son? I feared before that he was lost to us; I fear now even more than before, for I am sure that he would never [285] have parted with his horse, which he had reared from a colt and was much attached to. These men from whom you bought it, were they known in that locality?\" \"No,\" Hugh replied. \"Wherever they came from they did not belong to that corner of Texas, for neither the judge nor the sheriff had ever seen them before. Had they known that they were bad characters they would have arrested them and held them until an owner was found for the horse; but as they knew nothing against them they did not feel justified in doing so.\" \"Will you describe them to me?\" the Mexican said. \"They were men of between thirty and forty. From their attire they might have been hunters. They were dressed a good deal like your vaqueros: they wore chaperajos with red sashes around their waist, and flannel shirts. They had jackets with silver buttons, which you don\u0027t see much among our cow-boys on the plains, and broad, soft, felt hats. I should say that one was a half-breed—that is to say, half Mexican, half American. Both had black moustaches, and what I should call hang-dog faces.\" \"I have no doubt, from your description,\" Don Ramon said, \"they were two men who joined the caravan a day or two before my son left it. These men said they were hunters, and I was told that my son engaged them to accompany him while he was hunting, to act as guides, and show him the best places for game. They were described to me by some of the party that returned here, and I feared at the time that if evil had befallen him it was through them. Now that you tell me they sold you his horse, I feel but too certain this was so.\" \"They seemed to have ridden fast and far. Their own horses and the bay were in fair condition, se?or, but the pack-horse was very poor. The men were evidently in great haste to get away, and I should judge from this that if, as you fear, they murdered your son and his three servants, they probably did it [286] at the last camping place before they arrived at M\u0027Kinney. Had they done it when far out on the plains there would have been no good reason why they should have been in so much haste; but if it had been but a short distance away they might have feared that someone might find the bodies and organize a pursuit at once.\" \"Why should they have delayed so long if their intention was murder?\" the younger Mexican asked. \"That I cannot say, Don Carlos. They may have fallen in with other hunters after leaving the caravan, and these may have kept with them all the time they were out on the plains, and they may have had no opportunity of carrying out their designs till the party separated; or again, your brother\u0027s attendants might have been suspicious of them, and may have kept up too vigilant a watch for them to venture on an attack before. But this watch may have been relaxed when the journey was just at an end, and it seemed to them that their fears were unfounded.\" \"That is the most likely explanation,\" Don Ramon said. \"They were three picked men; two of them were hunters, the other my son\u0027s body-servant. It is likely enough that the hunters would have kept alternate watch at night had they suspected these fellows. Those two were to have remained in charge of the horses at the town where my son took rail, and to await his return there; the other man was to accompany him to New York. My son had an ample supply of gold for his expenses, and I fear it was that rather than the horse that attracted the scoundrels.\" They were by this time approaching a large and handsome building, standing in extensive grounds. As they halted before it a number of peóns ran out and took the horses. Prince had quickened his pace as he neared the house, and had given a joyful neigh as of recognition. When Hugh alighted, the horse, as usual, laid his muzzle on his shoulder to receive a caress [287] before turning away, and then, without waiting for one of the peóns to take his rein, walked away towards the stables. \"I see he is fond of you, se?or. You have been a kind master to him.\" \"I love horses,\" Hugh said, \"and Prince, as I have called him, has been my companion night and day for eighteen months. We have hunted together, and roped-in cattle, and fought Indians, and divided out last crust together.\" Don Ramon led the way into the house, and then into a room where an elderly lady and two young ones were sitting. They rose as he entered. \"What news, Ramon?\" the elderly lady asked. \"Such news as there is is bad, Maria. These caballeros, Don Hugh Tunstall and—\" (he hesitated and looked at Royce, with whose name he was not acquainted). \"Bill Royce, without any Don!\" the cow-boy put in. The Mexican repeated the name—\"have been good enough to ride over here with me, in order that you, as well as I, might question them as to what they know of our son. Unhappily they know little. We were not misinformed. Don Hugh has indeed our son\u0027s horse, but he bought it, as he has proved to me, from two strangers, who tally exactly with the description we have received of the two hunters who left the caravan with our son. I feared all along that these men were at the bottom of whatever might have befallen Estafan. I fear now that there is no doubt whatever about it. Caballeros, this is my wife, Donna Maria Perales. These are my two daughters, Dolores and Nina.\" For an hour Hugh and his companion remained answering the questions of Donna Perales; then Hugh rose, feeling that the ladies would be glad to be alone in their grief, for the confirmation of their fears respecting Don Estafan had brought their loss back to them freshly. Don Ramon and his son accompanied them to the door. \"I pray you,\" the former said, \"that if at any time you [288] come upon the villains you give them in custody. I and my son will make the journey to appear against them, however far it may be.\" \"You need not trouble on that score,\" Royce said. \"If we meet them, I warrant you we can manage their business without any bother of judge or jury. They will have a cow-boy trial, and after the evidence Hugh and I can give, you may be sure that a rope will very soon settle their affair.\" \"I must ask you, Don Ramon,\" Hugh said, \"to lend me a horse back to the town, and to send a vaquero with me to bring it back.\" \"But why, sir?\" the Mexican asked in surprise. \"You have your own horse.\" \"No, se?or, Prince is not mine. He was your son\u0027s, and is yours. A man who buys stolen property is liable to lose it if he meets the proper owner, and when I bought Prince for half his value I knew that I was running that risk.\" \"No, se?or Englishman. I do not say that a man who has lost his horse has not the right to reclaim it wherever he may find it. That is, if he happens to be in a place where the law is respected, or if not if he happens to be with the strongest party; but in the present case I could not think of depriving you of the horse. It is evident that he has found a good master, and that you stand in his affections just as my son did; besides, if you will pardon my saying so, the horse is more to you than it is to me. There are many thousands of horses running wild on my estates, and although my son used to assert that there was not one which was equal to his horse, there are numbers that are but little inferior, for our horses are famous. They are mustangs crossed with pure Arab blood, which my grandfather had selected and sent over to him, regardless of cost. Pray, therefore, keep the bay. May it carry you long and safely! It will be a real pleasure to my wife and myself to know that poor Estafan\u0027s favourite horse is in such good hands. [289] I have also,\" he said courteously to Royce, \"taken the liberty of ordering my peóns to change the saddle of the horse you rode to one more worthy of being a companion to the bay. It is of no use for one man to be well mounted if his comrade does not bestride a steed of similar swiftness.\" Hugh and Royce warmly thanked Don Ramon for his kindness. The horses were brought round, and that of Royce fully bore out the commendation of the Mexican. \"We hope to see you again to-morrow,\" Don Ramon said as they mounted. \"You will always be welcome guests here.\" \"And you will not forget,\" Don Carlos said in a low tone, \"if you ever meet those men.\" \"That has been a fortunate adventure,\" Royce said as they rode off. \"I have often wondered whether we should ever fall upon the original owner of your horse, and pictured to myself that we might have a bad time of it if we did. It isn\u0027t everyone who would have accepted that receipt of yours as proof.\" \"No; I always felt that myself, Royce. Well, that sorrel of yours is a splendid animal, and really worthy to go with Prince. I often wished you had a mount as good as mine, for my sake as well as your own, for there is no doubt of the truth of what he said. When two friends are riding together their pace is only that of the slowest horse.\" \"That is so,\" Royce agreed. \"So there is some Arab blood in them. I have often talked over the bay in the camps. We all agreed we had never seen so good a mustang. There are good mustangs, but they are never a match for a really first-rate States horse, and yet we could not see any signs of such a cross in Prince. He wur mustang, but there seemed more whip-cord and wire about him than a mustang has. I have heard say that the mustangs are the descendants of Spanish barbs, and that the barbs were Moorish horses.\" \"Yes, that is so, Royce. The barb is related to the Arab, but is not, I believe, of such pure blood; it is a coarser [290] animal; and if Don Ramon\u0027s grandfather brought over some pure Arabs of first-rate strain they would, no doubt, greatly improve the mustangs.\" \"Waal, Hugh, if we ever do meet those two murdering villains, I reckon their chances of getting away from us ain\u0027t worth mentioning.\" The reception on their return to the hotel was very different to that they had before experienced. They had been visitors at Don Ramon\u0027s hacienda, and Don Ramon was the richest proprietor in the district of El Paso. After they had finished supper that evening, and were enjoying coffee and cigars at a table placed with others in a garden behind the hotel, the two miners who had stood by them in the morning came up and took seats beside them. \"You had a pretty rough welcome this morning at El Paso,\" the big man said. \"But, by the way, I do not know what to call you. My own name is Sim. I am generally known as Surly Sim. My friend\u0027s name is Frank; I generally call him the doctor.\" \"My name is Bill,\" Royce said; \"and out on the plain the boys call me Stumpy, which don\u0027t need any explanation. My mate\u0027s name is Hugh, and he has got the name of Lightning.\" \"Ah! and why is that, may I ask?\" the white-haired little man said. \"Well, it is because of one of his accomplishments, doctor. He has got the knack of drawing a pistol that sharp, that almost before you see his hand move you are looking down the tube of a pistol.\" \"A very useful accomplishment,\" the little man remarked, \"always supposing that it is not used too often, and that it is only used in self-defence. I am a peaceful man myself,\" he went on, \"and have a horror of the use of fire-arms.\" His companion laughed. \"Now you know that that is so, Sim,\" the little man said earnestly. [291] \"Waal, doctor, I don\u0027t go for to say that you are quarrelsome, and ef anyone said so in my hearing I should tell him he wur a liar. But for a peaceable man, doctor, and I don\u0027t deny as you are peaceable, I don\u0027t know as thar is a man in the mining regions who has used his weapon oftener than you have.\" \"But always on the side of peace, Sim,\" the little man said earnestly. \"Please to remember always on the side of peace.\" \"Yes, in the same way that a New York policeman uses his club, doctor.\" \"Well, I can assure you I don\u0027t often use what you call my accomplishment,\" Hugh said. \"I practise it so that I may be able to defend my life if I am attacked, but except in a fight with a band of Comanches, I have only once had occasion to draw my pistol.\" \"And he weakened?\" Sim asked. \"Yes, I had the drop of him. There was nothing else for him to do.\" \"And what are you doing at El Paso?\" \"You are too abrupt, Sim, much too abrupt,\" the little man said deprecatingly. \"Not at all, doctor. If it is anything they don\u0027t want to tell they won\u0027t tell it. If it isn\u0027t, we may be useful to them.\" \"We have no particular object in view,\" Hugh said. \"I am an Englishman; but not a rich Englishman, who comes out to buy ranches, or to speculate in mines. But I have come rather to pass three or four years in seeing life on the Western plains than to make money. I worked for six months in M\u0027Kinney, had three or four months\u0027 hunting, and then worked six months as a cow-boy; and I thought that, for a change, I should like to come this way and see something of mining adventure in New Mexico or Arizona. My mate here has been with me for nearly two years, and has thrown in his fortune with mine.\" \"There is adventure enough, and more than enough, in [292] mining down thar in Arizona. The doctor and I have been at it for some years. We haven\u0027t made a penny, but we have saved our scalps, so we may be considered lucky.\" \"I was told,\" Hugh went on, \"that El Paso was the most central place to come to. My idea was that I might find some party setting out on a prospecting expedition, and that I might be able to join it.\" \"It ain\u0027t a good time for prospecting expeditions,\" Sim said. \"Even on the Upper Gila the mining camps is all on guard, knowing that any day the Apaches may be down on them, and it would want a man to be wonderful fond of gold for him to go out prospecting down in Arizona.\" \"I don\u0027t care much for gold,\" Hugh laughed, \"though I don\u0027t say I should object to take my share if we hit on a rich lode. I should go for the sake of the excitement, and to see the life.\" \"Well, at other times you might find any number of people here in El Paso who would be glad enough to take you out on such an expedition,\" the doctor said. \"You ask the first man you meet, Mexican or white, and he will tell you that he knows of a mine, and will take you to it if you will fit out an expedition.\" \"You are exceptions to the rule, doctor.\" \"No, I don\u0027t say that,\" the doctor replied, though his companion gave a growling protest. \"Oh, yes, we know of a mine!\" he went on, not heeding the growl. \"At least we believe we do, which is, I suppose, as much as anybody can say; but we are like the rest, we say that it is better to stay at El Paso and keep our scalps on, even if we are poor, than to go and throw away our lives in looking for a mine. We have been out working for the last six months on a mine in the Gila Valley on shares with six others. We weren\u0027t doing so badly; but the Mexicans who were working for us got scared and wouldn\u0027t stay, so we have given it up [293] and come down here. Some day or other when things settle down again, I suppose the mine will be worked, but it won\u0027t be by us. We are looking out for someone who will buy our shares, but I don\u0027t suppose anyone will give five dollars for them, and they would be right. The thing paid in our hands, but it wouldn\u0027t pay in Mexicans\u0027. They are poor shiftless creatures, and have no idea of hard work. We should have given it up anyhow, even without these Indian troubles, which don\u0027t make much difference, for the Apaches are always ready to come down when they see a chance. It is always war between them and the whites. But we were there six months, and six months are about the outside Sim and I ever stop anywhere.\" \"When you go prospecting, do you often get any hints from the Indians as to where gold is to be found?\" \"Never,\" Sim Howlett said. \"The Injuns are too lazy to work theirselves, and they know that when the whites get hold of gold they pour down in numbers. I believe they do know often where there are lodes. I don\u0027t see how they can be off knowing it, for a Red-skin is always keeping his eyes on the move. Nothing escapes him, and it would be strange if, wandering about as they do, and knowing every foot of their country, they didn\u0027t notice gold when it is there to see. Besides, they have got tales handed down from father to son. In old times they had gold ornaments and such like, but you never see them now. They know well enough that such things would draw the whites. Sometimes a Red-skin will tell a white who has done him some great service where there is a lode, gold or silver or copper, but it don\u0027t happen often. Besides, most times the place lies right in the heart of their country, and for all the good it is, it might as well be in the middle of the sea. Of course, if it was gold, and the metal was found in nuggets, and a horse-load or two could be got in a month, it might be done; but not when it comes to settling [294] there and sinking shafts and mining; that can\u0027t be done until the Apaches are wiped out.\" \"But are there such places as that, Sim?\" \"Waal, there may be, but I have never seen them. The doctor and me have struck it rich many a time, but not as rich as that. Still, I reckon there are places where the first comer might gather a big pile if the Red-skins would but let him alone for a month.\" \"I suppose you are absent some time on one of these expeditions? Do prospectors generally go on foot or horseback?\" \"They in general takes a critter a piece, and two others to carry grub and a pick and shovel; sometimes they go two together, but more often one goes by hisself. In course where two men knows each other and can trust each other, two is kind of handier than one. We shouldn\u0027t like to work alone, should we, doc? But then, you see, we have been twelve years together. Sometimes a man finds his own outfit. Sometimes he goes to a trader in a town; and if he is known to be a good miner and a straight man, the storekeeper will give him a sack of flour and a side of bacon, and such other things as are required, and then they go partners in what is found. Sometimes this goes on for months, sometimes for years; sometimes the trader loses his money, sometimes he makes a fortune. You see there are plenty of places as ain\u0027t in what you may call the Indian country, but somehow or other it do seem as if the Red-skins had just been put down where the best places is, so as to prevent the gold being dug. In Arizona some big finds have been made, but nobody\u0027s any the richer for them. The Red-skins is always on the look-out. Often an exploring party never comes back. Sometimes one or two come back with the news that the others have all been wiped out; but what with the awful country and the want of water, and the sartainty of having to fight, and of sooner or later [295] being surprised and scalped, there ain\u0027t many men as cares about following the thing up.\" \"I suppose you know of such places, Sim?\" \"Waal, maybe we do,\" the miner said cautiously. \"Maybe we do; eh, doctor?\" The little man did not reply, but sat looking searchingly at Hugh. When he did speak it was not in direct answer to the question. \"I like your face, young fellow,\" he said. \"It reminds me of one I have seen somewhere, though I can\u0027t say where. You look to me as if you were downright honest.\" \"I hope I am,\" Hugh said with a laugh. \"You may bet your boots on that,\" Bill Royce said. \"He is as straight a man as you will find in Texas.\" \"And you are out here,\" the other went on, \"part for pleasure, part just to see life, and part, I suppose, to make money if you see a chance?\" \"I have never thought much of making money,\" Hugh replied, \"although I should certainly have no objection if I saw a chance; but I have never thought of doing more than keeping myself.\" \"And he has been with you, you say, nigh two years?\" and he nodded at Royce. \"And you can speak for him as he does for you?\" \"That I can,\" Hugh said warmly. \"We have worked together and hunted together, we have been mates in the same outfit, and we have fought the Comanches together, and I can answer for him as for myself. He gave up his work and went with me, not because there was any chance of making more money that way than any other, but because we liked each other.\" \"Well, Sim,\" the little man said, \"it seems to me that these two would make good mates for that job of ours.\" \"Waal, doctor, you know I leave these things to you. I [296] kinder feels that way myself towards them, and anyhow I don\u0027t see as there can\u0027t be no harm in setting it afore them, seeing as there ain\u0027t no need to give them the indications. But I reckon there is too many about here to talk on a matter like that. Waal, it comes to this,\" he went on, turning to Hugh, \"if you air disposed to make a jint expedition with us, and ain\u0027t afeard neither of roughing it nor of Red-skins, you meet us to-morrow three miles outside the town on the South Road, and we will talk to you straight.\" \"That is just what would suit me,\" Hugh said; \"and you, Royce?\" \"It is all the same to me, Lightning. If you are for an expedition you know you can count me in.\" \"Good night, then,\" Sim Howlett said, rising. \"We have sat here quite long enough talking together if we mean to do anything. I reckon there is a score of these Mexikins have been saying to themselves afore now, What can those two miners and them cow-boys be a-talking together about? and when a Mexikin begins to wonder, he begins to try and find out; so we are off. Three miles out on the South Road at nine o\u0027clock to-morrow morning. About half a mile past a village you will see a stone cross by the road. There is a path turns off by it, you follow that, and you will come across us afore you have gone two hundred yards.\" \"What do you think of it, Royce?\" Hugh asked when they were alone. \"Don\u0027t think nothing of it one way or the other. Most of them miners have got some tale or other. However they seem to me straight men.\" \"I feel sure they are,\" Hugh said. \"The big one looks an honest fellow. I don\u0027t so much understand the little one, but evidently he is the head of the party. He is a curious little fellow with his white hair and gentle voice. He doesn\u0027t look strong enough for such a life as they lead, but I suppose he is [297] able to do his share or they would never have been working twelve years together. At any rate I came here to see something of life among the mines, and this seems as good a chance as we are likely to have.\" The next morning they breakfasted at seven, and at half-past eight saddled their horses and rode out. They found their two companions of the previous night at the appointed place. As the miners saw them approaching they turned off the path and preceded them to a Mexican hut, and there waited for them to come up. \"Good morning!\" the doctor said as they dismounted; \"there is no fear of our being overheard here. The Mexican who lives here has often been up with us among the hills, and started for the town a quarter of an hour ago, when we told him we had a rendezvous here. Now, if you will hitch your horses up and sit down on these maize stalks we can talk comfortably. A year ago, when Sim and I were working in a gulch among the mountains, we heard a call in the distance. We went to see what it was, and found a man who had dropped down, just worn out and famished, after he had given the cry that fetched us. He had been shot in four or five places, and we saw at once that his journey was nearly over. \"We carried him to our fire and brought him round, and did all we could for him for three weeks; then he died. He told us he had been one of a party of six who had been prospecting in the hills west of the Lower Gila. One of them had learned, from an Indian he had helped in some way, of a place where the bed of a stream was full of gold. They found it; but the next morning they were attacked by the Apaches, who had, I expect, been following them all the time. Two of them were killed at once, the others got upon their horses and rode for it. Three of them were shot down, but this man was well mounted and got off, though they chased him for three days. He lost his way; his horse fell dead, but he struggled [298] on until he saw the smoke of our fire and made us out to be whites. \"Before he died he told us how the place could be found. He said there was no doubt about the gold, and he had three or four nuggets in his pockets, weighing two or three pounds each. He said he had had lots of bigger ones, but had chucked them all away to lighten his horse. Well, it is a long journey. It will take us all a month, I reckon, to get there. We cannot go straight—the Apaches would have us to a certainty—but must go north into the Moquis country, and then down again from that side. We have been minded to try it ever since, but luck has been bad with us, and, besides, two men wouldn\u0027t be enough for such a journey. \"It ain\u0027t every one Sim and I would care about going with, but we have both taken a fancy to you. We saw you stand up straight before that crowd of Mexicans; besides, we know it wants good grit for that cow-boy life. Now this is the offer we make. We have got two horses, and we can buy two pack-horses, but we can\u0027t go further than that. You have got two out-and-out horses; we saw you ride in yesterday afternoon. You will want another pack-horse, and you will have to provide the outfit: say two bags of flour, two sides of bacon, ten pounds of tea, and a couple of gallons of spirits; then there will be sugar and some other things. \"We shall also want a small tent. Now if you like to join us on these terms you can. There is plenty of gold for us all. But mind you, it will be no child\u0027s play. The journey from the Moquis country there will be terrible; and there is the chance, and a pretty big chance it is, I tell you, of a fight with the Red-skins. We may never find the place. We have got pretty good indications, but it is not an easy matter to find a place among those mountains. Still, there it is. If you get there and back you will each have a horse-load of gold; if you don\u0027t you will leave your bones there. What do you say to it?\" [299] Hugh looked at Royce. \"I reckon we kin take our chances if you kin,\" the latter said. \"At any rate, mates, you will find as we can take our share in whatever comes.\" \"Then that is agreed,\" the doctor said. \"Now about preparations. It will never do for you to be buying the things here; for if we were seen to start off together we should be followed, sure enough; it would be guessed at once we had told you of something good. We must not be seen together again. We will get our pack-horses and load up, and go as if we were undertaking a job on our own account, and camp up somewhere twenty miles away, and stop there a week. After we have gone you can get your outfit and move off and join us. Sim and I have been talking over whether it will be a good thing to take José—that is the man here—with us, instead of buying baggage horses. He has got four beasts. He could ride one himself, and the other three, with the one you have, would make up the number. José can be trusted; besides, we should not tell him where we were going, but we should have to say it would be a long journey and a dangerous one. He is a widower, with one child, and these horses are his only possession, and I think he would want their value put down before he started, say seventy-five dollars a-piece for them and their saddles, that is three hundred dollars. You wouldn\u0027t buy them for less. So as far as money goes it would come to the same thing. You will get it back again if José and the animals come back; but if we all do come back, three hundred dollars would be nothing one way or the other. Then comes the point, would it be worth while to take him? There would be one more mouth to feed, but that does not go for much; there would be one more rifle in case we had to fight, and José has plenty of courage. I have seen him in a fix before now. He would look after the beasts and leave our hands free; and his pay would cost us nothing, for if we got there he would help us gather and wash the gold.\" [300] \"What is the drawback then?\" Hugh asked. \"The drawback is, that if we have to ride for it he might hinder us.\" \"There ain\u0027t much in that, doc.,\" Sim Howlett put in. \"Our horses are pretty good though they ain\u0027t much to look at, but the horses our mates here have got would leave them standing, and I don\u0027t know that José\u0027s best is much slower than ours; besides, when you are working among those mountains speed goes for nothing. A horse accustomed to them would pick his way among the rocks faster\u0027n a race-horse. Ef we are attacked there running won\u0027t be much good to us. Ef we get fairly out from the hills with the gold and the \u0027Paches are on our trail, why, we then must trust to cunning, and our mates here can ride clear away.\" \"We sha\u0027n\u0027t do that, Sim,\" Hugh said. \"If we throw in our lot with you we shall share it to the end, whatever it is.\" \"Waal, that is all right, lad; but there are times when stopping to fight is just throwing away your life without doing no good. The doctor here and me ain\u0027t men to desart mates; but when a time comes where it ain\u0027t no sort of good in the world to fight, and when those mates must get rubbed out whether you stick by them or not, then it is downright onreasonable for anyone as can get clear off to throw away his life foolish.\" \"Well, anyhow, Sim,\" Hugh said, \"it seems to me that it will be best to take José and his horses with us. It will, as you say, leave our hands free, and it will make the journey much more pleasant, and will add one to our strength. Well, that would cost, you say, three hundred dollars; how much will the rest of the outfit cost?\" \"Three hundred at the outside,\" the doctor said. \"We have been reckoning it up. Of course we have all got kits, and it\u0027s only grub and ammunition we have got to buy, and two or three more shovels, and some pans for washing the sand, and [301] another pick or two, and a couple of crowbars. Three hundred dollars will get as much grub as the four pack-horses will carry, and make a good proper outfit for us. Will your money run to that?\" \"Hardly,\" Hugh said, \"that\u0027s just about what we have got between us. We had each six months\u0027 pay to draw when we left the ranche, and I had some before. I think we are about twenty dollars short of the six hundred.\" \"That is plenty,\" the doctor said. \"If you put in four hundred, Sim and I can chip in another two hundred, as we sha\u0027n\u0027t have to buy pack-horses; so we have plenty between us. We shall see José to-night and talk it over with him, and if he agrees he will come to you and bring a document for you to sign, saying that if he does not return in six months, the three hundred dollars are to be paid over for the use of his child; then he will go with you to a priest and put the paper and the money in his hands; then you can hand him over your pack-horse, he will take charge of it; then, if you will give us a hundred dollars, we engage to get the outfit all provided. When it is all done we will let you know what day you are to meet us, and where. You see we are asking you to trust us right through.\" \"That is all right,\" Hugh said. \"We are trusting you with our lives, and the dollars don\u0027t go for much in comparison.\" \"That is so,\" Sim Howlett said. \"Waal, there is nothing more to say now. You had best ride back to the town and give yourself no more trouble about it. You will hear from us in a few days, or it maybe a week. We shall buy half the things and send them on by José, and then get the others and follow ourselves. It would set them talking here if we was to start with four loads. There is some pretty bad men about this place, you bet.\" \"Well, we sha\u0027n\u0027t have much for them to plunder us of,\" Hugh said. [302] \"Four laden horses wouldn\u0027t be a bad haul, but it ain\u0027t that I am afraid of. If there wur a suspicion as we was going out to work a rich thing, there is plenty of men here would get up a party to track us, and fall on us either there or on our way back. There are two or three bands of brigands upon the mountains, and they are getting worse. There have been several haciendas burned and their people killed not many miles from El Paso. Parties have been got up several times to hunt them down, but they never find them; and there is people here as believe that the officers of the guárda are in their pay. They have come across us more than once when we have been prospecting. But they don\u0027t interfere with men like us, because, firstly, we haven\u0027t got anything worth taking, anyway nothing worth risking half a dozen lives to get; and in the next place, ef it got known they had touched any of our lot, the miners would all join and hunt them down, and they know right enough that would be a different thing altogether to having to deal with the Mexikins.\" Five minutes later Hugh and Royce were on their way back to El Paso.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3127/85996.html","bookId":897,"book":{"id":897,"title":"Redskin and Cow-Boy","description":"简介： Cedar Gulch was, in 1851, a flourishing camp.
