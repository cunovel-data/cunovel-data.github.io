{"id":33783,"no":3,"title":"CHAPTER II. TERRIBLE NEWS.","content":"WILLIAM TUNSTALL returned to Cedar Gulch the very day upon which his mates began to expect him. Having finished up the work in their claim on the previous day they strolled up the hill to meet the coach on the chance of his coming. \"Well, mate, how goes it?\" Sim Howlett asked. \"Well, it doesn\u0027t go at all, Sim.\" \"How is that?\" \"Well, the lawyer was civil, and all that, but if I had let him he would have made me believe that I was not Will Tunstall at all. I showed him my brother\u0027s letters, which ought to have satisfied anyone, and he hinted that these might have come into my possession anyhow, that Tunstall might be dead, or that his kit, with these letters in it, might have been stolen.\" \"That is the very thing the doctor said he would be after,\" Sim Howlett exclaimed in great admiration at the latter\u0027s perspicacity. \"I suppose he didn\u0027t say he thought so, Bill?\" the doctor asked. \"No, he knew better than that, doctor. He kept on saying that he was quite satisfied, but that other people wouldn\u0027t be satisfied. Then he asked about references, who could I refer to? Could I refer to anyone who had known me as William Tunstall before the date of these letters? I said that I had been knocking about on the plains and doing trapping and [30] Indian fighting for years, and that I was known as English Bill, and that I did not suppose there were half a dozen fellows ever did know my name, and that, for aught I knew, they had all been scalped, shot, or hung long ago. He said, in that case I should have to go to England to prove my claim. I said I would see the claim at the bottom of the sea first, and then I left him. \"I met some fellows, and made a night of it, but in the morning the lawyer turned up at the hotel just as I had finished breakfast. I had told him the hotel where I was staying. He said it was no use being hasty. I said I wasn\u0027t hasty, and we were near having a row again. Then he said that he had only had instructions to find me, and did not know how much was left me under the will, or anything about it, except what he had put in the advertisement. At any rate he would write to the people who had instructed him in England and tell them that a gentleman representing himself to be William Tunstall had called, and that he possessed letters from the late Mr. Edgar Tunstall. That in the present state of affairs I declined to make the voyage to England for the purpose of proving my identity, but that he had my address, and could communicate further with me upon receiving instructions from them. \"I told him to say that I didn\u0027t want the money, and was not going to put myself out one way or the other about it. He listened, and shook his head, just the way the doctor does when he don\u0027t agree with you. Then he remarked that he would not do anything rash if he were in my place. I told him it was no odds to me whether he would or would not, and as I had just time to catch the steamer I wasn\u0027t going to waste any more time jawing over it, so off I came, and here I am. Well, what is doing here? Has there been any fresh rush?\" \"Nary one. The doctor and I think we cannot do better than stay here. I was talking with Halkett and his partners this afternoon. They don\u0027t get on well together. Halkett said they would sell out if they could get a fair price. They are [31] getting out about six ounces a day. No great thing, but they are only half-way down at present. It is in four shares, for two of the gang are on day wages. Of course, I said that it wasn\u0027t much of a thing to buy, as they were only getting an ounce a piece, and besides, the shaft is badly timbered. Still, if they would say what they wanted for it we would talk it over with you when you got back. Halkett was evidently anxious to sell, and said they would take a hundred ounces for it right out. Of course I said that was too much, but I think it is a bargain, so does the doctor. They have got through the worst half, and there is the best behind. It don\u0027t always turn out rich on the bed-rock here; it didn\u0027t with us. Still, there is the chance of it; and if it only keeps as it is now, and we take on a couple of men to work with us, we should, after paying them and keeping ourselves, be making three ounces a day anyhow, and it will take us a couple of months to get to the bottom, and perhaps more.\" \"How do we stand after the clear-up, doctor?\" for Frank was the treasurer of the party. \"We got twenty ounces at the last clear-up, and we had eighty-nine before, so if we give him his price we should have nine ounces left.\" \"It will take fifty or sixty dollars,\" Sim Howlett said, \"to make that shaft safe. Halkett is the only one of the lot that knows anything about that, and it has been done in a very slovenly style. I shouldn\u0027t like to work down there until we have strengthened it all the way down. I told Halkett the other day that if he didn\u0027t mind it would be caving in. I think that is partly why they are selling.\" \"Well, I think we couldn\u0027t do better than take it, Sim; but you must get them to knock a few ounces off, otherwise we shan\u0027t have enough to repair the shaft, and from what you say we must do that before we go to work in the bottom. Let us go and make a bargain at once.\" \"That will never do, Bill,\" Sim Howlett said; \"that would look as if we had made up our mind to take it, and they wouldn\u0027t [32] come down an ounce. No, no, we will have our meal, and wait an hour or two, then I will stroll round to Halkett\u0027s tent and say that as we calculate it would cost a heap of money to make the shaft safe we do not see our way to it, though we might otherwise have taken to the job. Then you will see to-morrow morning, when they knock off for breakfast, Halkett will come round here and make some proposal.\" So indeed it turned out. Soon after breakfast Halkett came to the tent door. \"Look here, boys,\" he said, \"I want to get out of this lot. The men I am working with ain\u0027t worth shucks. The three of them don\u0027t do a fair man\u0027s work, and I am sick of it. But I have been talking to them, and they won\u0027t take less than twenty-five ounces a share, and they have been talking to some men who have pretty well made up their minds to give it. If I had the dust I would buy the others out, but I haven\u0027t. If you will buy the other three out at their terms I will keep my share and work partners with you. I have got enough dust to pay my share of retimbering the shaft. What do you say?\" The doctor had gone off to take some broth to two of his patients. The other two looked at each other, and then Sim Howlett said: \"Well, this is how it stands, Halkett. My mate here and I would have no objection to work with you; but it is this way: we and the doctor have chummed together, and have never taken anyone else in with us, partly because we are quite content as it is, and partly because the doctor can\u0027t do his share of the workâ€”he hasn\u0027t got it in him. We don\u0027t want to go away from here now, and we have dust enough to buy your three partners out. I suppose we should want to work four at that shaft. I don\u0027t know what you have been working six for, except that three of your lot are of no use.\" \"That is about it,\" Halkett said. \"So you see we should have to take on a man to do the doctor\u0027s work.\" \"Well, you would have to do that if you worked it yourselves.\" [33] \"So we should,\" Sim Howlett assented. \"What do you say, Bill?\" \"Halkett\u0027s proposal seems a fair one, Sim; it seems to me we can\u0027t do better than accept it. We must consult the doctor, Halkett. He is sure to agree, but we should not like to do it without speaking to him; that would not be fair. But you may consider it a bargain.\" \"Very well, I will go back and tell them I have made the agreement with you. Then I will come back and bring you fifteen ounces of dust, which is all I have got; I don\u0027t want them to know that I am going to stop in it. If I do, like enough they will cut up rusty, so I want you to make it up and hand the hundred ounces over clear; then they will hand me my share, and I can give you the other ten ounces. They will leave the camp as soon as they get their money. Somebody has been blowing to them about a find he has made prospecting among the hills, and I fancy they mean going off with him, and it would be no use letting on that I am going to stop in the partnership until they have gone. They are just the sort of fellows to think that I had been somehow besting them, and if they said so there would be trouble, and I don\u0027t want to do any of them harm.\" The doctor on his return fell in, as a matter of course, with his mates\u0027 arrangement. At dinner-time Halkett and his partners came in, and the dust was weighed out and handed over to them. Sim Howlett and Tunstall spent the afternoon in making a careful examination of the shaft, and in deciding upon the best plan for strengthening it. Halkett\u0027s former partners left a couple of hours after they got the money, and on the following morning the new proprietors of the claim set to work. The first step was to make an arrangement with a man who had horses, to haul timber from a little saw-mill that had been erected two miles away, and as soon as this began to arrive, the work of strengthening the shaft was set about. It took the three men, and another whom they had taken on at daily pay, a week, and [34] at the end of that time it was pronounced safe against any pressure it was likely to have to bear. The advertisement in the Sacramento paper had been noticed by others than by those for whom it was intended, and there happened to be among the miners who had worked at various times in the same diggings with William Tunstall another who had been on the jury when he had mentioned his name. He did not, however, notice the advertisement until a day or two after the newspaper had arrived in camp. \"There,\" he said to some mates who were sitting round the fire, \"that is just like my luck; there is five hundred dollars slipped clean through my fingers because I did not happen to see this here paper before.\" \"How is that, Jones?\" \"Why, here is five hundred dollars offered for information as to the whereabouts of William Tunstall.\" \"And who is William Tunstall? I never heard of him.\" \"Why, English Bill; that is his name sure enough; he gave it on a jury we served on together. I told him then I had never heard the name before. That is how I came to remember it.\" \"Well, why are you too late? Why don\u0027t you write off at once and say he is here, and claim the money?\" \"Because he is gone, mate. Sim Howlett asked Black Johnson yesterday, when I was standing by, if he knew of a good man he could take on for a week\u0027s work, as he was single-handed, for of course Limping Frank don\u0027t count in the way of work. I asked him if English Bill was laid up, and he said, No; he had gone the night before down to Frisco. I wondered then at his starting just before they had cleaned up their claim. Now it is clear enough, he had seen this advertisement.\" \"Bolted?\" one of the other men asked. \"Bolted! no,\" Jones said in a tone of contemptuous disgust. \"You don\u0027t suppose English Bill has been cutting anyone\u0027s throat, do you? or robbing some digger of his swag? No, he has gone down to Frisco to see the chap that put this into [35] the paper. Why, look here,\" and he read the advertisement aloud; \"he has come into a fortune, I expect. They would never have taken the trouble to advertise for him if it hadn\u0027t been a big sum. You bet English Bill has struck it rich; like enough it is a thundering big ranche, with two or three hundred thousand head of cattle.\" \"They don\u0027t have estates like that in England,\" another digger put in. \"I was chatting with an Englishman at Holly Creek. He said land was worth a heap there, but it was all cultivated and hedged in, and he didn\u0027t suppose as there was a man in the whole country who had got as much as five thousand head of cattle. However, cattle or not, I expect it is a big thing English Bill has come in for, and we shan\u0027t see him in here again.\" The news spread quickly through the camp. It was discussed by the men as they worked the rockers, by the gamblers up at the saloon, and in the tents when the work was done. Sim Howlett was soon questioned, but was surly, and little could be got from him. Limping Frank was no more communicative. He was accosted frequently, as he went from the tents with his soups and medicines, with \"Well, Frank, so I hear your mate has come in for a big thing, and gone down to Frisco. Jack Jones saw the advertisement for him in the paper.\" \"If Jack Jones saw it, of course it was there,\" the doctor said with his quiet smile; \"couldn\u0027t have seen it otherwise, could he? Yes, Bill has gone off. I am glad to hear that it is a big thing; hadn\u0027t heard it before. It will be a surprise to him, for he didn\u0027t expect it would be a big thing. Didn\u0027t think it would be worth troubling about, you see. However, I daresay he will be back in a week or two, and then no doubt he will tell you all about it.\" Cedar Gulch was greatly disappointed when English Bill reappeared in his ordinary red shirt, high boots, and miner\u0027s hat, and went to work on the following afternoon as if nothing had happened. There had been a general idea that if he came back he would appear in store-clothes and a high hat, and [36] perhaps come in a carriage with four horses all to himself, and that he would stand champagne to the whole camp, and that there would be generally a good time. He himself, when questioned on the subject, turned the matter off by saying he had not thought the thing worth bothering about; that he could not get what there was without going to England to fetch it, and that it might go to the bottom of the sea before he took that trouble. The only person to whom he said more was the man who ran the gambling-table. Things had been lately going on more quietly there, and the gambler had postponed his departure to San Francisco. Bill Tunstall spent, as the doctor said, no inconsiderable portion of his earnings at the gambling-tables, and had struck up an acquaintance with Symonds. The latter was, like many of his class, a man of quiet and pleasant manners. For his profession a nerve of iron was required, for pistols were frequently drawn by disappointed miners, flushed with drink and furious at their losses, and the professional gambler had his life constantly in his hands. The accusation, \"You cheated me!\" was the sure signal for one or two pistol shots to ring out in sharp succession, then a body would be carried out, and play resumed. Symonds bore no worse reputation than others of the class. It was assumed, of course, that he would cheat if he had the chance; but with a dozen men looking on and watching every movement of the fingers, even the cleverest gambler generally played fair. These men were generally, by birth and education, far above those with whom they played. They had fallen from the position they had once occupied; had, perhaps, in the first place been victims of gamblers, just as they now victimized others; had been cast out from society as detected cheats or convicted swindlers; but now, thanks to nerve, recklessness of life, and sleight of hand, they reaped a fortune, until the bullet of a ruined miner, or the rope of Judge Lynch, cut short their career. Symonds was not unpopular among the miners. He was liberal [37] with his money, had many times spared men who, according to the code of the diggings, had forfeited their lives by an insult or by a shot that had missed its aim. He had often set men on their legs again who had lost their all to him; and if there was a subscription raised for some man down with fever, or for a woman whose husband had been killed in a shaft, Symonds would head the list with a handsome sum. And yet there were few men more feared. Magnanimous on some occasions, he was ruthless on others. He was a dead shot, and handled his pistol with a lightning speed, that in nine cases out of ten enabled him to fire first; and while he would contemptuously spare a man who was simply maddened by ruin and drink, the notorious bully, the terror of a camp, a man who deliberately forced a quarrel upon him, relying upon his strength or skill, would be shot down without hesitation. Thus in nine cases out of ten the feeling of the communities among whom he plied his vocation was in his favour. While he himself was a dangerous man, he rid the camp of others who were still more obnoxious, and the verdict after most of these saloon frays was, \"Served him right;\" but as a rule men avoided discussing Symonds or his affairs. It was dangerous to do so, for somehow he seemed always to learn what was said of him, and sooner or later the words were paid for. Will Tunstall knew that he was a dangerous man, and had no doubt that he was an utterly unscrupulous one, but he himself never drank while he played, and was never out of temper when he lost, therefore he had no reason whatever to fear the man, and Symonds had always been civil and pleasant with him, recognizing that there was something in him that placed him somewhat apart from the rough crowd. He met him one afternoon soon after his return. \"Is it true all this they are saying about you, Bill?\" Symonds asked. \"Well, it is true enough that I was advertised for, and went down to Frisco to see a man there about it. Of course it is all nonsense as to what they are saying about the value of it. [38] It is some family property that might have come to me long ago if I hadn\u0027t kicked over the traces; but I am not going to trouble about it. I shall have all the bother and expense of going to England to prove who I am, and I wouldn\u0027t do it if it were ten times as much.\" \"Come and have a glass of cham, Bill. My own story is a good deal like yours. I daresay I might be master of a good estate in the old country now, if I hadn\u0027t gone a mucker.\" \"It is too early to drink,\" Will said; \"if I did drink it would be just a cocktail. The champagne you get is poison.\" \"Just as you like. By the way, if I can be of any use to you let me know. It is an expensive run home to England from here, and if you have need for a thousand dollars, I could let you have them. I have had a good run of luck this last six months. It would be a business transaction, you know, and you could pay me a couple of hundred for the use of it. It is of no use losing a good thing for the want of funds.\" \"Thank you, Symonds. I have enough to take me home if I have to go; but I am very much obliged for the offer all the same.\" \"It is business,\" the other said carelessly, \"and there are no thanks due. If you change your mind let me know; mind I owe you a cocktail next time we meet in the saloon.\" The gambler went on. Will Tunstall looked after him with a little wonder at the offer he had made. \"It is a good-natured thing to offer, for, of course, if I went to England he could not make anything out of me beyond the interest of the money, and he would get more than that putting it on house property in Frisco. He is a queer card, and would look more at home in New York than in Cedar Gulch!\" SYMONDS AND BILL TUNSTALL HAVE A TALK. The gambler\u0027s dress, indeed, was out of place with the surroundings. Like most of his class he dressed with scrupulous neatness; his clothes were well made, and fitted him; he wore a white shirt, the only one in the camp, and abstained from the diamond studs and rings, and heavy gold watch-chain that was generally affected by professional gamblers. He was tall, [39] as tall as Tunstall himself, though not so broad or so strongly built; but his figure was well knit, there was in his walk and action an air of lightness and activity, and he had more than once shown that he possessed an altogether unusual amount of muscular strength. \"It is a pity that the fellow is what he is,\" Will Tunstall said when he turned away; \"what a soldier he would have made, with his strength, and pluck, and wonderful coolness!\" This little conversation was followed by several others. Somehow or other they met more frequently than they had done before, and one evening, when there was no play in the saloon, Symonds asked him to come in and have a chat with him in his private room at the hotel. For some time they chatted on different subjects. Symonds had brought out a box of superb cigars, and a bottle of such claret as Will Tunstall had not drunk for years, saying carelessly as he did so, \"I always carry my own tipple about with me. It would ruin my nerves to drink the poison they keep at these places.\" After a time he brought the subject round to the legacy. \"I have been thinking over what you said about not going back, and I think you are wrong, if you don\u0027t mind my saying so. What have you got to look forward to here? Toil and slave year after year, without ever getting a step further, living all the time a life harder than that of the poorest labourer at home. It is well enough now, I suppose. You are seven or eight and thirty, just about my own age; in another ten years you will be sorry you let the chance slip. Of course it is different with me. As far as money goes, I could give it up now, but I cannot go back again. Men don\u0027t take to my sort of life,\" he said with some bitterness, \"unless they have got a pretty bad record behind them; but I shall give it up before very long, unless I am wiped out first. Then I\u0027ll go and settle in South America, or some place of that sort, buy an estate, and set up as a rich and virtuous Englishman whose own climate doesn\u0027t agree with him.\" Then he carelessly changed the subject again, but it was [40] reverted to once or twice in the course of the evening, and before Will left he had said enough to enable his companion to gather a fair estimate of the value of the property, and the share he was likely to have of it. The new claim turned out fairly well, improving somewhat in depth, and yielding a good though not an extraordinary profit to the partners. Some four months after Will Tunstall had been down to San Francisco, he received a bulky letter from the attorney there. It contained an abstract of his brother\u0027s will. This left him half the property, with a statement saying that he considered it to be his brother\u0027s by right, and inclosed with it was a copy of a letter written a few days before his death. It ran as follows:â€” \"My dear Will,â€”You have wandered about long enough. It is high time for you to come back to the old place that you ought never to have left. I shall not see you again, for I have long been suffering from heart-disease, and the doctors tell me the end may come any day. I have had the opinion of some of the best authorities, and they all say that, thanks to some peculiar wording in the will, which I don\u0027t understand in the slightest, the prohibition to divide with you is only binding during my lifetime, and that nothing is said that restricts my right to leave it as I please. I don\u0027t suppose the contingency of your surviving me ever entered into our father\u0027s mind, and probably he thought that you would never be heard of again. However, you see it has turned out otherwise. You have wandered and roughed it, and gone through dangers of all sorts, and are still, you tell me, strong and healthy. I have lived quietly and comfortably with every luxury, and without a day\u0027s trouble, save my terrible grief when my wife died, and the ever-constant regret that you were not here beside me; yet I am dying, but that enables me at last to redress to some extent the cruel wrong you have suffered. \"I have left you half the estate, and it makes me happy to think that you will come back again to it. I have appointed you sole guardian of my boy. He is only twelve years old, and I want you to be a father to him. The estate is large enough for you both, and I hope that you may, on your return, marry, and be happy here; if not, I suppose it will all go to him at your death. In any case, I pray you to come home, for the boy\u0027s sake, and for your own. It is my last request, and I hope and believe that you will grant it. You were always good to me when we were boys together, and I feel sure that you will well supply my place to Hugh. God bless you, old fellow! Your affectionate brother, Edgar.\" [41] With these documents was a letter from the solicitors to the family saying that they had heard from their agents at San Francisco that he had presented himself in answer to their advertisement, and had shown them the letters of the late Mr. Edgar Tunstall. They therefore forwarded him copies of the will, and of Mr. Tunstall\u0027s letter, and begged him to return home without delay, as his presence was urgently required. They assumed, of course, that they were writing to Mr. William Tunstall, and that when he arrived he would have no difficulty whatever in proving his identity. \"I think I must go, boys,\" he said as, after reading his brother\u0027s letter three or four times, he folded the papers up, and put them in his pocket. \"My brother has made me guardian of his boy, and puts it so strongly that I think I must go over for a bit. I don\u0027t suppose I shall have to stop; although the lawyers say that I am urgently required there; but, mind, I mean to do just what I said. I shall take a thousand pounds or so, and renounce the rest. A nice figure I should make setting up at home as a big land-owner. I should be perfectly miserable there. No, you take my word for it, I shall be back here in six months at the outside. I shall get a joint guardian appointed to the boy; the clergyman of the place, or some one who is better fitted to see after his education and bringing up than I am. When he gets to seventeen or eighteen, and a staunch friend who knows the world pretty well may be really of use to him, I shall go over and take him on his travels for two or three years. Bring him out here a bit, perhaps. However, that is in the distance. I am going now for a few months; then you will see me back here. I wish I wasn\u0027t going; it is a horrible nuisance, but I don\u0027t see that I can get out of it.\" \"Certainly you cannot, Bill; it is your plain duty. We don\u0027t go by duty much in these diggings, and it will be pleasant to see somebody do a thing that he doesn\u0027t like because it is right. We shall miss you, of courseâ€”miss you badly. But we all lose friends, and nowhere so much as here; for what with [42] drink and fever and bullets the percentage wiped out is large. You are going because, in fact, you can\u0027t help yourself. We shall be glad when you come back; but if you don\u0027t come back, we shall know that it was because you couldn\u0027t. Yes, I know you have quite made up your mind about that; but circumstances are too strong for men, and it may be that, however much you may wish it, you won\u0027t be able to come. Well, we shall be clearing up the claim in another two or three days, so it could not come at a better time if it had to come.\" The work was continued to the end of the week, and then, the last pan of dirt having been washed, the partners divided the result. Each week\u0027s take had been sent down by the weekly convoy to the bank at Sacramento, for robberies were not uncommon, and prudent men only retained enough gold-dust by them for their immediate wants. But adding the dust and nuggets acquired during the last and best week\u0027s work to the amount for which they had the bank\u0027s receipt, the four partners found that they had, after paying all their expenses, two hundred and fifty ounces of gold. \"Sixty-two ounces and a half each,\" the doctor said. \"It might have been better, it might have been worse. We put in twenty-five each four months ago, so we have got thirty-seven ounces each for our work, after paying expenses, and each drawing half an ounce a day to spend as he liked. This we have, of course, all of us laid by.\" There was a general laugh, for not one of them had above an ounce or two remaining. \"Well, it isn\u0027t bad anyhow, doctor,\" William Tunstall said. \"Sixty-two ounces apiece will make roughly ï¿¡250, which is as much as we have ever had before on winding up a job. My share will be enough to lake me to England and back.\" \"Yes, provided you don\u0027t drop it all in some gambling saloon at Sacramento or San Francisco,\" the doctor said. \"I shan\u0027t do that, doctor. I have lost big sums before now in a night\u0027s play, I confess; but I knew I could set to work and earn more. Now I have got an object before me.\" [43] That afternoon English Bill went round the camp saying good-bye to his acquaintances, and although it was very seldom that he drank too much, the standing treat and being treated in turn was too much for his head, and it was with a very unsteady step indeed that he returned late in the evening to his tent. Sim Howlett, who had started with him, had succumbed hours before, and had been carried down from the saloon by a party who were scarcely able to keep on their own legs. When Will Tunstall woke in the morning he had but a vague idea of the events of the latter part of the evening. He remembered hazily that there had been many quarrels and rows, but what they had been about he knew not, though he felt sure that there had been no shooting. He had a dim recollection that he had gone into Symonds\u0027 room at the hotel, where he had some champagne, and a talk about his trip to England and about the people there. \"What the deuce could have set me talking about them?\" he wondered in his mind. He was roused from these thoughts by the doctor. \"If you are going to catch this morning\u0027s coach, Bill, you must pull yourself together.\" \"All right!\" he said, getting on to his feet. \"I shall be myself when I have put my head in a bucket of water. I\u0027m afraid I was very drunk last night.\" \"Well, you were drunk, Bill. I have never seen you drunk but once before since we were partners; but I suppose no one ever did get out of a mining camp where he had been working for some time, and had fairly good luck, without getting pretty well bowled over after going the rounds to say good-bye. Now, then, Sim, wake up! Bill will be off in a quarter of an hour. I have got breakfast ready.\" Sim Howlett needed no second call. It was no very unusual thing for him to be drunk overnight and at work by daybreak the following morning. So after stretching himself and yawning, and following Will\u0027s example of having a wash, he was [44] ready to sit down to breakfast with an excellent appetite. Will, however, did poor justice to the doctor\u0027s efforts, and ten minutes later the trio started off to meet the coach. There were many shouts of \"Good-bye, mate! good luck to yer!\" from the men going down to the diggings, but they were soon beyond the camp. Few words were said as they went up the hill, for the three men were much attached to each other, and all felt the parting. Fortunately they had but two or three minutes to wait before the coach came in sight. \"Just you look out for me in about six months\u0027 time, mates; but I\u0027ll write directly I get home, and tell you all about things. I shall direct here, and you can get someone to ask for your letters and send them after you if you have moved to a new camp.\" With a last grasp of the hand, Tunstall climbed up to the top of the coach, his bundle was thrown up to him, the coachman cracked his whip, the horses started again at a gallop, and Sim Howlett and his mate went down to Cedar Gulch without another word being spoken between them. Three days later, as they were breakfasting in their tent, for they had not yet made up their minds what they should do, a miner entered. \"Hello, Dick! Back from your spree? How did you get on at Frisco?\" \"Yes, I have just got off the coach. I have got some bad news to tell you, mates.\" \"Bad news! Why, what is that, Dick?\" Sim Howlett asked. \"Well, I know it will hit you pretty hard, mates, for I know you thought a heap of him. Well, lads, it is no use making a long story of it, but your mate, English Bill, has been murdered.\" The two men started to their feetâ€”Sim Howlett with a terrible imprecation, the doctor with a cry like the scream of a woman. \"It is true, mates, for I saw the body. I should have been up yesterday, but I had to wait for the inquest to say who he [45] was. I was going to the coach in the morning when I saw half a dozen men gathered round a body on the footway of a small street. There was nothing unusual in that at Sacramento. I don\u0027t know what made me turn off to have a look at the body. Directly I saw it I knew who it was. It was English Bill, so I put off coming, and stopped to the inquest. He hadn\u0027t been killed fair, he had been shot down from behind with a bullet in the back of his head. No one had heard the shot particular. No one thinks anything of a shot in Sacramento. No one seemed to know anything about him, and the inquest didn\u0027t take five minutes. Of course they found a verdict of wilful murder against some person unknown.\" Sim Howlett listened to the narration with his hands clenched as if grasping a weapon, his eyes blazing with fury, and muttering ejaculations of rage and horror. The doctor hardly seemed to hear what was said. He was moving about the tent in a seemingly aimless way, blinded with tears. Presently he came upon his revolver, which he thrust into his belt, then he dropped his bag of gold-dust inside his shirt, and he then picked up his hat. \"Come along, Sim,\" he said in hurried tones, touching his companion on the arm. \"Come along!\" Sim repeated. \"Where are you going?\" \"To Sacramento, of course. We will hunt him down, whoever did it. I will find him and kill him if it takes years to do it.\" \"I am with you,\" Sim said; \"but there is no coach until to-night.\" \"There is a coach that passes through Alta at twelve o\u0027clock. It is fifteen miles to walk, but we shall be there in time, and it will take us into Sacramento by midnight.\" Sim Howlett snatched up his revolver, secured his bag of gold-dust, and said to the man who had brought the news, \"Fasten up the tent, Dick, and keep an eye on it and the traps. The best thing will be for you to fix yourself here until we come back.\" [46] \"That will suit me, Sim. I got rid of all my swag before I left. You will find it all right when you return.\" They had but four hours to do the distance across a very broken and hilly country, but they were at Alta a quarter of an hour before the coach was due. It taxed Sim Howlett\u0027s powers to the utmost, and even in his rage and grief he could not help looking with astonishment at his companion, who seemed to keep up with him without difficulty. They ran down the steep hills and toiled up the formidable ascents. The doctor\u0027s breath came quick and short, but he seemed almost unconscious of the exertions he was making. His eyes were fixed in front of him, his face was deadly pale, his white hair damp with perspiration. Not a word had been spoken since the start, except that, towards the end of the journey, Howlett had glanced at his watch and said they were in good time and could take it easy. His companion paid no attention, but kept on at the top of his speed. When the coach arrived it was full, but the doctor cried out, \"It is a matter of life and death; we must go! We will give five ounces apiece to any one who will give us up their places and go on by the next coach.\" Two men gladly availed themselves of the offer, and at midnight the two companions arrived at Sacramento. The doctor\u0027s strength had given way when the necessity for exertion was over, and he had collapsed. \"Perhaps someone has got a flask with him?\" Sim Howlett suggested. \"My mate and I have just heard of the murder of an old chum of ours at Sacramento, and we are on our way down to find out who did it and to wipe him out. We have had a hard push for it, and, as you see, it has been too much for my mate, who is not over strong.\" Half a dozen bottles were instantly produced, and some whiskey poured down the doctor\u0027s throat. It was not long before he opened his eyes, but remained for some time leaning upon Sim Howlett\u0027s shoulder. \"Take it easy, doctor, take it easy,\" the latter said as he [47] felt the doctor straightening himself up. \"You have got to save yourself. You know we may have a long job before us.\" There was nothing to do when they entered the town but to find a lodging for the night. In the morning they commenced their search. It was easy to find the under-sheriff who had conducted the inquest. He had but little to tell. The body had been found as they had already heard. There were no signs of a struggle. The pockets were all turned inside out. The sheriff supposed that the man had probably been in a gambling-house, had won money there, and had been followed and murdered. Their first care was to find where Will Tunstall was buried, and then to order a stone to be erected at his head. Then they spent a week visiting every gambling-den in Sacramento, but nowhere could they find that anyone at all answering to their mate\u0027s description had been gambling there on the night before he was killed. They then found the hotel where he had put up on the arrival of the coach. He had gone out after breakfast and had returned alone to dinner, and had then gone out again. He had not returned; it was supposed that he had gone away suddenly, and as the value of the clothes he had left behind was sufficient to cover his bill, no inquiries had been made. At the bank they learned that in the course of the afternoon he had drawn his portion of the joint fund on the order signed by them all. At another hotel they learned that a man certainly answering to his description had come in one evening a week or so before with a gentleman staying at the house. They did not know who the gentleman was; he was a stranger, but he was well dressed, and they thought he must have come from Frisco. He had left the next day. They had not noticed him particularly, but he was tall and dark, and so was the man who came in with him. The latter was in regular miner\u0027s dress. They had not sat in the saloon, but had gone up to the stranger\u0027s bed-room, and a bottle of spirits had been taken up there. They did not notice what time the miner left, or whether the other went out with him. The house was full, and they did [48] not bother themselves as to who went in or out. It was from a German waiter they learned all this, after having made inquiries in vain two or three times previously at this hotel. As soon as they left the place the doctor seized Sim\u0027s arm. \"We have got a clew at last, Sim.\" \"Not much of a clue, doctor; still there is something to go upon. We have got to hunt out this man.\" \"Do you mind going back to the camp to-night, Sim?\" \"No, I don\u0027t mind; but what for, doctor?\" \"You go and see whether Symonds is still there, and if not, find out what day and hour he left.\" \"Good heavens! you don\u0027t suspect him?\" \"I feel sure, Sim, just as sure as if I had seen it. The description fits him exactly. Who else could Bill have known dressed like a gentleman that he would have gone up to drink with when he had ï¿¡250 about him. You know he had got rather thick with that villain before he left the camp, and likely enough the fellow may have got out of him that he was going to draw his money from the bank, and thought that it was a good bit more than it was. At any rate go and see.\" Two days later Sim Howlett returned with the news that Symonds had left two or three hours after Tunstall had done so. He had said that he had a letter that rendered it necessary that he should go to Frisco, and had hired a vehicle, driven to Alta, and caught the coach there. He had not returned to the camp. \"That settles it, Sim. When I find Symonds the gambler, I find the murderer of Bill Tunstall. I have been thinking it over. It may be months before I catch him. He may have gone east into Colorado or south into Mexico, but I am going to find him and kill him. I don\u0027t think it is any use for us both to hunt; it may take months and years.\" \"Perhaps he thinks he is safe, and hasn\u0027t gone far. He may think that poor Bill will be picked up and buried, and that no one will be any the wiser. We would have thought that he had gone off to England; and so it would have been if [49] Dick hadn\u0027t happened to come along and turn off to look at the body. Like enough he will turn up at Cedar Gulch again.\" \"He may,\" the doctor said thoughtfully, \"and that is the more reason why you should stop about here. You would hear of his coming back to any of the mining camps on the slopes. But I don\u0027t think he will. He will feel safe, and yet he won\u0027t feel quite safe. Besides, you know, I dreamt that I should kill him. However, if he does come back anywhere here I leave him to you, Sim. Shoot him at sight as if he were a mad dog. You don\u0027t want any fair play with a fellow like that. When you tell the boys the story they will all say you did right. I will write to you from time to time to let you know where I am. If you have killed him let me know. I shall come back to you as soon as I have found him.\" And so it was settled; for, eager as Sim Howlett was for vengeance, he did not care for the thought of years spent in a vain search, and believed that his chance of meeting Symonds again was as good among the mining camps as elsewhere. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3127/85982.html","bookId":897,"book":{"id":897,"title":"Redskin and Cow-Boy","description":"ç®€ä»‹ï¼š Cedar Gulch was, in 1851, a flourishing camp.
