{"id":1767,"title":"Enslave Me Sweetly (Alien Huntress #2)","description":"Storyline: Enslave Me Sweetly (Alien Huntress #2) Eden Black walks among humans, protecting them from the murderous evil of other-worlders who abduct and enslave. And though she appears to be human herself, Eden is an alien, a Raka, distinguished by her golden hair and skin, and gifted with the ominous ability to kill without remorse -- and with total accuracy. That is, until the fateful night she has one shot to eliminate her target, a human slaver -- and misses. \"Failure\" is not in Eden\u0027s vocabulary. Neither is \"partner\" -- but that\u0027s what she is forcibly assigned after recovering from her disastrous mission. A sexy, steely-nerved human agent, Lucius Adaire enjoys nothing more than sparking the fury -- and rousing the desire -- of the fiery female assassin too proud to admit defeat. Locked in an assignment they cannot afford to lose, Lucius and Eden find themselves bound in two high-stakes, heart-pounding games: the sensual web of kill or be killed, and the erotic dance of seduction.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/enslave-me-sweetly-alien-huntress-2.jpg","author":"Gena Showalter","type":"Science Fiction","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":34,"category":{"id":7,"name":"Science Fiction","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
