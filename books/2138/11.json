{"id":95375,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"NOT AS CLEVER AS THEY THINK\\n\\n My master, he says that I am to pay you, yes?\" the slobbering little brown-skinned man said to one of the fortress guards. \"Kohrin Soulez is Dallabad, yes? My master, he says I pay Kohrin Soulez for water and shade, yes?\"\\n\\n The Dallabad soldier looked to his amused companion, and both of them regarded the little man, who continued bobbing his head stupidly.\\n\\n \"You see that tower?\" the first asked, drawing the little man\u0027s gaze with his own toward the crystalline structure gleaming brilliantly over Dallabad. \"That is Ahdahnia\u0027s tower. Ahdahnia Soulez, who now rules Dallabad.\"\\n\\n The little man looked up at the tower with obvious awe. \"Ah-dahn-ee-a,\" he said carefully, slowly, as if committing it to memory. \"Soulez, yes? Like Kohrin.\"\\n\\n \"The daughter of Kohrin Soulez,\" the guard explained. \"Go and tell your master that Ahdahnia Soulez now rules Dallabad. You pay her, through me.\"\\n\\n The little man\u0027s head bobbed frantically. \"Yes, yes,\" he agreed, handing over the modest purse, \"and my master will meet with her, yes?\"\\n\\n The guard shrugged. \"If I get around to asking her, perhaps,\" he said, and he held his hand out, and the little man looked at it curiously.\\n\\n \"If I find the time to bother to tell her,\" the guard said pointedly.\\n\\n \"I pay you to tell her?\" the little man asked, and the other guard snorted loudly, shaking his head at the little man\u0027s continuing stupidity.\\n\\n \"You pay me, I tell her,\" the guard said plainly. \"You do not pay me, and your master does not meet with her.\" \"But if I pay you, we... he, meets with her?\" \"If she so chooses,\" the guard explained. \"I will tell her. I can promise no more than that.\"\\n\\n The little man\u0027s head continued to bob, but his stare drifted off to the side, as if he was considering the options laid out before him. \"I pay,\" he agreed, and handed over another, smaller, purse.\\n\\n The guard snatched it away and bounced it in his hand, checking the weight, and shook his head and scowled, indicating clearly that it was not enough. \"All I have!\" the little man protested. \"Then get more,\" ordered the guard. The little man hopped all about, seeming unsure and very concerned. He reached for the second purse, but the guard pulled it back and scowled at him. A bit more shuffling and hopping, and the little man gave a shriek and ran off.\\n\\n \"You think they will attack?\" the other guard asked, and it was obvious from his tone that he wasn\u0027t feeling very concerned about the possibility.\\n\\n The group of six wagons had pulled into Dallabad that morning, seeking reprieve from the blistering sun. The drivers were twenty strong, and not one of them seemed overly threatening, and not one of them even looked remotely like any wizard. Any attack that group made against Dallabad\u0027s fortress would likely bring only a few moments of enjoyment to the soldiers now serving Ahdahnia Soulez.\\n\\n \"I think that our little friend has already forgotten his purse,\" the first soldier replied. \"Or at least, he has forgotten the truth of how he lost it.\"\\n\\n The second merely laughed. Not much had changed at the oasis since the downfall of Kohrin Soulez. They were still the same pirating band of toll collectors. Of course the guard would tell Ahdahnia of the wagon leader\u0027s desire to meet with her-that was how Ahdahnia collected her information, after all. As for his extortion of some of the stupid little wretch\u0027s funds, that would fade away into meaninglessness very quickly. Yes, little had really changed.\\n\\n \"So it is true that Kohrin is dead,\" remarked Lipke, the coordinator of the scouting party, the leader of the \"trading caravan.\"\\n\\n He glanced out the slit in his tent door to see the gleaming tower, the source of great unease throughout Calimshan. While it was no great event that Kohrin Soulez had at last been killed, nor that his daughter had apparently taken over Dallabad Oasis, rumors tying this event to another not-so-minor power shift among a prominent guild in Calimport had put the many warlords of the region on guard.\\n\\n \"It is also true that his daughter has apparently taken his place,\" Trulbul replied, pulling the padding from the back collar of his shirt, the \"hump\" that gave him the slobbering, stooped-over appearance. \"Curse her name for turning on her father.\"\\n\\n \"Unless she had no choice in the matter,\" offered Rolmanet, the third of the inner circle. \"Artemis Entreri has been seen in Calimport with Charon\u0027s Claw. Perhaps Ahdahnia sold it to him, as some rumors say. Perhaps she bartered it for the magic that would construct that tower, as say others. Or perhaps the foul assassin took it from the body of Kohrin Soulez.\"\\n\\n \"It has to be Basadoni,\" Lipke reasoned. \"I know Ahdahnia, and she would not have so viciously turned against her father, not over the sale of a sword. There is no shortage of gold in Dallabad.\"\\n\\n \"But why would the Basadoni Guild leave her in command of Dallabad?\" asked Trulbul. \"Or more particularly, how would they leave her in command, if she holds any loyalty to her father? Those guards were not Basadoni soldiers,\" he added. \"I am sure of it. Their skin shows the weathering of the open desert, as with all the Dallabad militia, and not the grime of Calimport\u0027s streets. Kohrin Soulez treated his guild well-even the least of his soldiers and attendants always had gold for the gambling tents when we passed through here. Would so many so quickly abandon their loyalties to the man?\"\\n\\n The three looked at each other for a moment and burst into laughter. Loyalty had never been the strong suit of any of Calimshan\u0027s guilds and gangs.\\n\\n \"Your point is well taken,\" Trulbul admitted, \"yet it still does not seem right to me. Somehow there is more to this than a simple coup.\"\\n\\n \"I do not believe that either of us disagrees with you,\" Lipke replied. \"Artemis Entreri carries Kohrin\u0027s mighty sword, yet if it is a simple matter that Ahdahnia Soulez decided that the time had come to secure Dallabad Oasis for herself, would she so quickly part with such a powerful defensive item? Is this not the time when she will likely be most open to reprisals?\"\\n\\n \"Unless she hired Entreri to kill her father, with payment to be Charon\u0027s Claw,\" Rolmanet reasoned. He was nodding as he improvised the words, thinking that he had stumbled onto something very plausible, something that would explain much.\\n\\n \"If that is so, then this is the most expensive assassination Calimshan has known in centuries,\" Lipke remarked.\\n\\n \"But if not that, then what?\" a frustrated Rolmanet asked.\\n\\n \"Basadoni,\" Trulbul said definitively. \"It has to be Basadoni. They extended their grasp within the city, and now they have struck out again, hoping it to be away from prying eyes. We must confirm this.\"\\n\\n The others were nodding, reluctantly it seemed.\\n\\n Jarlaxle, Kimmuriel, and Rai-guy sat in comfortable chairs in the second level of the crystalline tower. An enchanted mirror, a collaboration between the magic of Rai- guy and Crenshinibon, conveyed the entire conversation between the three scouts, as it had followed the supposedly stupid little hunched man from the moment he had handed his purses over to the guard outside the fortress.\\n\\n \"This is not acceptable,\" Rai-guy dared to remark, turning to face Jarlaxle. \"We are grasping too far and too fast, inviting prying eyes.\"\\n\\n Kimmuriel sent his thoughts to his wizardly friend. Not here. Not within the tower replica of Crenshinibon. Even as he sent the message, he felt the energies of the shard tugging at him, prying around the outside of his mental defenses. With Yharaskrik\u0027s warnings echoing in his mind, and surely not wanting to alert Crenshinibon to the truth of his nature at that time, Kimmuriel abruptly ceased all psionic activity.\\n\\n \"What do you plan to do with them?\" Rai-guy asked more calmly. He glanced at Kimmuriel, relaying to his friend that he had gotten the message and would heed the wise thoughts well.\\n\\n \"Destroy them,\" Kimmuriel reasoned.\\n\\n \"Incorporate them,\" Jarlaxle corrected. \"There are a score in their party, and they are obviously connected to other guilds. What fine spies they will become.\"\\n\\n \"Too dangerous,\" Rai-guy remarked.\\n\\n \"Those who submit to the will of Crenshinibon will serve us,\" Jarlaxle replied with utmost calm. \"Those who do not will be executed.\"\\n\\n Rai-guy didn\u0027t seem convinced. He started to reply, but Kimmuriel put his hand on his friend\u0027s forearm and motioned for him to let it go.\\n\\n \"You will deal with them?\" Kimmuriel asked Jarlaxle. \"Or would you prefer that we send in soldiers to capture them and drag them before the Crystal Shard for judgment?\"\\n\\n \"The artifact can reach their minds from the tower,\" Jarlaxle replied. \"Those who submit will willingly slay those who do not.\"\\n\\n \"And if those who do not are the greater?\" Rai-guy had to ask, but again, Kimmuriel motioned for him to be quiet, and this time, the psionicist rose and bade the wizard to follow him away.\\n\\n \"With the changes in Dallabad\u0027s hierarchy and the tower so evident, we will have to remain fully on our guard for some time to come,\" Kimmuriel did say to Jarlaxle.\\n\\n The mercenary leader nodded. \"Crenshinibon is ever wary,\" he explained.\\n\\n Kimmuriel smiled in reply, but in truth, Jarlaxle\u0027s assurances were only making him more nervous, were only confirming to him that Yharaskrik\u0027s information concerning the devastating Crystal Shard was, apparently, quite accurate.\\n\\n The two left their leader alone then with his newest partner, the sentient artifact.\\n\\n Rolmanet and Trulbul blinked repeatedly as they exited their tent into the stinging daylight. All about them, the other members of their band worked methodically, if less than enthusiastically, brushing the horses and camels and filling the waterskins for the remaining journey to Calimport.\\n\\n Others should have been out scouting the perimeter of the oasis and doing guard counts on Dallabad fortress, but Rolmanet soon realized that all seventeen of the remaining force was about. He also noticed that many kept glancing his way, wearing curious expressions.\\n\\n One man in particular caught Rolmanet\u0027s eye. \"Did he not already fill those skins?\" Rolmanet quietly asked his companion. \"And should he not be at the east wall, counting sentries?\" As he finished, he turned to Trulbul, and his last words faded away as he considered his companion, the man standing quietly, staring up at the crystalline tower with a wistful look in his dark eyes.\\n\\n \"Trulbul?\" Rolmanet asked, starting toward the man but, sensing that something was amiss, changing his mind and stepping away instead.\\n\\n An expression of complete serenity came over Trulbul\u0027s face. \"Can you not hear it?\" he asked, glancing over to regard Rolmanet. \"The music...\"\\n\\n \"Music?\" Rolmanet glanced at the man curiously, and snapped his gaze back to regard the tower and listened carefully.\\n\\n \"Beautiful music,\" Trulbul said rather loudly, and several others nearby nodded their agreement.\\n\\n Rolmanet fought hard to steady his breathing and at least appear calm. He did hear the music then, a subtle note conveying a message of peace and prosperity, promising gain and power and... demanding. Demanding fealty.\\n\\n \"I am staying at Dallabad,\" Lipke announced suddenly, coming out of the tent. \"There is more opportunity here than with Pasha Broucalle.\"\\n\\n Rolmanet\u0027s eyes widened in spite of himself, and he had to fight very hard to keep from glancing all around in alarm or from simply running away. He was gasping now as it all came clear to him: a wizard\u0027s spell, he believed, charming enemies into friends.\\n\\n \"Beautiful music,\" another man off to the side agreed.\\n\\n \"Do you hear it?\" Trulbul asked Rolmanet.\\n\\n Rolmanet fought very hard to steady himself, to paint a serene expression upon his face, before turning back to stare at his friend.\\n\\n \"No, he does not,\" Lipke said from afar before Rolmanet had even completed the turn. \"He does not see the opportunity before us. He will betray us!\"\\n\\n \"It is a spell!\" Rolmanet cried loudly, drawing his curved sword. \"A wizard\u0027s enchantment to ensnare us in his grip. Fight back! Deny it, my friends!\"\\n\\n Lipke was at him, slashing hard with his sword, a blow that skilled Rolmanet deftly parried. Before he could counter, Trulbul was there beside Lipke, following the first man\u0027s slash with a deadly thrust at Rolmanet\u0027s heart.\\n\\n \"Can you not understand?\" Rolmanet cried frantically, and only luck allowed him to deflect that second attack.\\n\\n He glanced about as he retreated steadily, seeking allies and taking care for more enemies. He noted another fight over by the water, where several men had fallen over another, knocking him to the ground and kicking and beating him mercilessly. All the while, they screamed at the man that he could not hear the music, that he would betray them in this, their hour of greatest glory.\\n\\n Another man, obviously resisting the tempting call, rushed away to the side, and the group took up the chase, leaving the beaten man facedown in the water. A third fight erupted on the other side. Rolmanet turned to his two opponents, the two men who had been his best friends for several years now. \"It is a lie, a trick!\" he insisted. \"Can you not understand?\"\\n\\n Lipke came at him hard with a cunning low thrust, followed by an upward slash, a twisting hand-over maneuver, and yet another upward slash that forced Rolmanet to lean backward, barely keeping his balance. On came Lipke, another straight-ahead charge and thrust, with Rolmanet quite vulnerable.\\n\\n Trulbul\u0027s blade slashed across, intercepting Lipke\u0027s killing blow.\\n\\n \"Wait!\" Trulbul cried to the astonished man. \"Rolmanet speaks the truth! Look more deeply at the promise, I beg!\" Lipke was fully into the coercion of the Crystal Shard. He did pause, only long enough to allow Trulbul to believe that he was indeed reflecting on the seeming inconsistency here. As Trulbul nodded, grinned, and lowered his blade, Lipke hit him with a slashing cut that opened wide his throat.\\n\\n He turned back to see Rolmanet in full flight, running to the horses tethered beside the water.\\n\\n \"Stop him! Stop him!\" Lipke cried, giving chase. Several others came in as well, trying to cut off any escape routes as Rolmanet scrambled onto his horse and turned the beast around, hooves churning the sand. The man was a fine rider, and he picked his path carefully, and they could not hope to stop him.\\n\\n He thundered out of Dallabad, not even pausing to try to help the other resister, who had been cut off, forced to turn, and would soon be caught and overwhelmed. No, Rolmanet\u0027s path was straight and fast, a dead gallop down the sandy road toward distant Calimport.\\n\\n Jarlaxle\u0027s thoughts, and those of Crenshinibon, angled the magical mirror to follow the retreat of the lone escapee.\\n\\n The mercenary leader could feel the power building within the crystalline tower. It was a quiet humming noise as the structure gathered in the sunlight, focusing it more directly through a series of prisms and mirrors to the very tip of the pointed tower. He understood what Crenshinibon meant to do, of course. Given the implications of allowing someone to escape, it seemed a logical course.\\n\\n Do not kill him, Jarlaxle instructed anyway, and he wasn\u0027t sure why he issued the command. There is little he can tell his superiors that they do not already know. The spies have no idea of the truth behind Dallabad\u0027s overthrow, and will only assume that a wizard... He felt the energy continuing to build, with no conversation, argument or otherwise, coming back at him from the artifact.\\n\\n Jarlaxle looked into the mirror at the fleeing, terrified man. The more he thought about it, the more he realized that he was right, that there was no real reason to kill this one. In fact, allowing him to return to his masters with news of such a complete failure might actually serve Bregan D\u0027aerthe. Likely these were no minor spies sent on such an important mission as this, and the manner in which the band was purely overwhelmed would impress- perhaps enough so that the other pashas would come to Dallabad openly to seek truce and parlay.\\n\\n Jarlaxle filtered all of that through his thoughts to the Crystal Shard, reiterating his command to halt, for the good of the band, and secretly, because he simply didn\u0027t want to kill a man if he did not have to,\\n\\n He felt the energy building, building, now straining release.\\n\\n \"Enough!\" he said aloud. \"Do not!\"\\n\\n \"What is it, my leader?\" came Rai-guy\u0027s voice, the wizard and his sidekick psionicist rushing back into the room.\\n\\n They entered to see Jarlaxle standing, obviously angry, staring at the mirror.\\n\\n Then how that mirror brightened! There was a flash as striking, and as painful to sensitive drow eyes, as the sun itself. A searing beam of pure heat energy shot out of the tower\u0027s tip, shooting down across the sands to catch the rider and his horse, enveloping them in a white-yellow shroud.\\n\\n It was over in an instant, leaving the charred bones of Rolmanet and his horse lying on the empty desert sands.\\n\\n Jarlaxle closed his eyes and clenched his teeth, suppressing his urge to scream out.\\n\\n \"Impressive display,\" Kimmuriel said.\\n\\n \"Fifteen have come over to us, and it would seem the other five are dead,\" Rai-guy remarked. \"The victory is complete.\"\\n\\n Jarlaxle wasn\u0027t so sure of that, but he composed himself and turned a calm look upon his lieutenants. \"Crenshinibon will discern those who are most easily and completely dominated,\" he informed the wary pair. \"They will be sent back to their guild-or guilds, if this was a collaboration- with a proper explanation for the defeat. The others will be interrogated-and they will willingly submit to all of our questions-so that we might learn everything about this enemy that came prying into our affairs.\"\\n\\n Rai-guy and Kimmuriel exchanged a glance that Jarlaxle did not miss, a clear indication that they had seen him distressed when they had entered. What they might discern from that, the mercenary leader did not know, but he wasn\u0027t overly pleased at that moment.\\n\\n \"Entreri is back in Calimport?\" he asked.\\n\\n \"At House Basadoni,\" Kimmuriel answered.\\n\\n \"As we should all be,\" Jarlaxle decided. \"We will ask our questions of our newest arrivals and give them over to Ahdahnia. Leave Berg\u0027inyon and a small contingent behind to watch over the operation here.\"\\n\\n The two glanced at each other again but offered no other response. They bowed and left the room.\\n\\n Jarlaxle stared into the mirror at the blackened bones of the man and horse.\\n\\n It had to be done, came the whisper of Crenshinibon into his mind. His escape would have brought more curious eyes, better prepared. We are not yet ready for that.\\n\\n Jarlaxle recognized the lie for what it was. Crenshinibon feared no prying, curious eyes, feared no army at all. The Crystal Shard, in its purest of arrogance, believed that it would simply convert the majority of any attacking force, turning them back on any who did not submit to its will. How many could it control? Jarlaxle wondered. Hundreds? Thousands? Millions?\\n\\n Images of domination, not merely of the streets of Calimport, not merely of the city itself, but of the entire realm, flittered through his thoughts as Crenshinibon \"heard\" the silent questions and tried to answer.\\n\\n Jarlaxle shifted his eye patch and focused on it, lessening the connection with the artifact, and tightened his willpower to try to keep his thoughts as much to himself as possible. No, he knew, Crenshinibon had not killed the fleeing man for fear of any retribution. Nor had it struck out with such overwhelming fury against that lone rider because it did not agree with the merits of Jarlaxle\u0027s arguments against doing so.\\n\\n No, the Crystal Shard had killed the man precisely because Jarlaxle had ordered it not to do so, because the mercenary leader had crossed over the line of the concept of partner and had tried to assume control.\\n\\n That Crenshinibon would not allow.\\n\\n If the artifact could so easily disallow such a thing, could it also step back over the line the other way?\\n\\n The rather disturbing notion did not bring much solace to Jarlaxle, who had spent the majority of his life serving as no man\u0027s, nor Matron Mother\u0027s, slave.\\n\\n \"We have new allies under our domination, and thus we are stronger,\" Rai-guy remarked sarcastically when he was alone with Kimmuriel and Berg\u0027inyon.\\n\\n \"Our numbers grow,\" Berg\u0027inyon agreed, \"but so too mounts the danger of discovery.\"\\n\\n \"And of treachery,\" Kimmuriel added. \"Witness that one of the spies, under the influence of Jarlaxle\u0027s artifact, turned against us when the fighting started. The domination is not complete, nor is it unbreakable. With every unwitting soldier we add in such a manner, we run the risk of an uprising from within. While it is unlikely that any would so escape the domination and subsequently cause any real damage to us-they are merely humans, after all-we cannot dismiss the likelihood that one will break free and escape us, delivering the truth of the new Basadoni Guild and of Dallabad to some of the guilds.\"\\n\\n \"We already have agreed upon the consequences of Bregan D\u0027aerthe being discovered for what it truly is,\" Rai-guy added ominously. \"This group came to Dallabad looking specifically for the answers behind the facade, and the longer we stretch that facade, the more likely that we will be discovered. We are forfeiting our anonymity in this foolish quest for expansion.\"\\n\\n The other two remained very silent for a long while. Then Kimmuriel quietly asked, \"Are you going to explain this to Jarlaxle?\"\\n\\n \"Should we be addressing this problem to Jarlaxle,\" Rai- guy countered, his voice dripping with sarcasm, \"or to the true leader of Bregan D\u0027aerthe?\"\\n\\n That bold proclamation gave the other two even more pause. There it was, set out very clearly, the notion that Jarlaxle had lost control of the band to a sentient artifact.\\n\\n \"Perhaps it is time for us to reconsider our course,\" Kimmuriel said somberly.\\n\\n Both he and Rai-guy had served under Jarlaxle for a long, long time, and both understood the tremendous weight of the implications of Kimmuriel\u0027s remark. Wresting Bregan D\u0027aerthe from Jarlaxle would be something akin to stealing House Baenre away from Matron Baenre during the centuries of her iron-fisted rule. In many ways, Jarlaxle, so cunning, so layered in defenses and so full of understanding of everything around him, might prove an even more formidable foe.\\n\\n Now the course seemed obvious to the three, a coup that had been building since the first expansive steps of House Basadoni.\\n\\n \"I have a source who can offer us more information on the Crystal Shard,\" Kimmuriel remarked. \"Perhaps there is a way to destroy it or at least temporarily to cripple its formidable powers so that we can get to Jarlaxle.\"\\n\\n Rai-guy looked to Berg\u0027inyon and both nodded grimly.\\n\\n Artemis Entreri was beginning to understand just how much trouble was brewing for Jarlaxle and therefore for him. He heard about the incident at Dallabad soon after the majority of the dark elves returned to House Basadoni, and knew from the looks and the tone of their voices that several of Jarlaxle\u0027s prominent underlings weren\u0027t exactly thrilled by the recent events.\\n\\n Neither was Entreri. He knew that Rai-guy\u0027s and Kimmuriel\u0027s complaints were quite valid, knew that Jarlaxle\u0027s expansionist policies were leading Bregan D\u0027aerthe down a very dangerous road indeed. When the truth about House Basadoni\u0027s change and the takeover of Dallabad eventually leaked out-and Entreri was now harboring few doubts that it would-all the guilds and all the lords and every power in the region would unite against Bregan D\u0027aerthe. Jarlaxle was cunning, and the band of mercenaries was indeed powerful-even more so with the Crystal Shard in their possession-but Entreri held no doubts that they would be summarily destroyed, every one.\\n\\n No, the assassin realized, it wouldn\u0027t likely come to that. The groundwork had been clearly laid before them all, and Entreri held little doubt that Kimmuriel and Rai-guy would move against Jarlaxle and soon. Their scowls were growing deeper by the day, their words a bit bolder.\\n\\n That understanding raised a perplexing question to Entreri. Was the Crystal Shard actually spurring the coup, as Lady Lolth often did among the houses in Menzoberranzan? Was the artifact reasoning that perhaps either of the more volatile magic-using lieutenants might be a more suitable wielder? Or was the coup being inspired by the actions of Jarlaxle under the prodding, if not the outright influence, of Crenshinibon?\\n\\n Either way, Entreri knew that he was becoming quite vulnerable, even with his new magical acquisitions. However he played through the scenario, Jarlaxle alone remained the keystone to his survival.\\n\\n The assassin turned down a familiar avenue, moving inconspicuously among the many street rabble out this evening, keeping to the shadows and keeping to himself. He had to find some way to get Jarlaxle back in command and on strong footing. He needed for Jarlaxle to be in control of Bregan D\u0027aerthe-not only of their actions but of their hearts as well. Only then could he fend a coup-a coup that could only mean disaster for Entreri.\\n\\n Yes, he had to secure Jarlaxle\u0027s position. Then he had to find a way to get himself far, far away from the dark elves and their dangerous intrigue.\\n\\n The sentries at the Copper Ante were hardly surprised to see him and even informed him that Dwahvel was expecting him and waiting for him in the back room.\\n\\n She had already heard of the most recent events at Dallabad, he realized, and he shook his head, reminding himself that he should not be surprised, and also reminding himself that it was just her amazing ability for the acquisition of knowledge that had brought him to Dwahvel this evening.\\n\\n \"It was House Broucalle of Memnon,\" Dwahvel informed him as soon as he entered and sat on the plush pillows set upon the floor opposite the halfling.\\n\\n \"They were quick to move,\" Entreri replied.\\n\\n \"The crystalline tower is akin to a huge beacon set out on the wasteland of the desert,\" Dwahvel replied. \"Why do your compatriots, with their obvious need for secrecy, so call attention to themselves?\"\\n\\n Entreri didn\u0027t answer verbally, but the expression on his face told Dwahvel much of his fears.\\n\\n \"They err,\" Dwahvel concurred with those fears. \"They have House Basadoni, a superb front for their exotic trading business. Why reach further and invite a war that they cannot hope to win?\"\\n\\n Still Entreri did not answer.\\n\\n \"Or was that the whole purpose for the band of drow to come to the surface?\" Dwahvel asked with sincere concern. \"Were you, too, perhaps, misinformed about the nature of this band, led to believe that they were here for profit- mutual profit, potentially-when in fact they are but an advanced war party, setting the stage for complete disaster for Calimport and all Calimshan?\"\\n\\n Entreri shook his head. \"I know Jarlaxle well,\" he replied. \"He came here for profit-mutual profit for those who work along with him. That is his way. I do not think he would ever serve in anything as potentially disastrous as a war party. Jarlaxle is not a warlord, in any capacity. He is an opportunist and nothing more. He cares little for glory and much for comfort.\"\\n\\n \"And yet he invites disaster by erecting such an obvious, and obviously inviting, monument as that remarkable tower,\" Dwahvel answered. She tilted her plump head, studying Entreri\u0027s concerned expression carefully. \"What is it?\" she asked.\\n\\n \"How great is your knowledge of Crenshinibon?\" the assassin asked. \"The Crystal Shard?\"\\n\\n Dwahvel scrunched up her face, deep in thought for just a moment, and shook her head. \"Cursory,\" she admitted. \"I know of its tower images but little more.\"\\n\\n \"It is an artifact of exceeding power,\" Entreri explained. \"I am not so certain that the sentient item\u0027s goals and Jarlaxle\u0027s are one and the same.\"\\n\\n \"Many artifacts have a will of their own,\" Dwahvel stated dryly. \"That is rarely a good thing.\"\\n\\n \"Learn all that you can about it,\" Entreri bade her, \"and quickly, before that which you fear inadvertently befalls Calimport.\" He paused and considered the best course for Dwahvel to take in light of fairly recent events. \"Try to find out how Drizzt came to possess it, and where-\"\\n\\n \"What in the Nine Hells is a Drizzt?\" Dwahvel asked.\\n\\n Entreri started to explain but just stopped and laughed, remembering how very wide the world truly was. \"Another dark elf,\" he answered, \"a dead one.\"\\n\\n \"Ah, yes,\" said Dwahvel. \"Your rival. The one you call \u0027Do\u0027Urden. \"\\n\\n \"Forget him, as have I,\" Entreri instructed. \"He is only relevant here because it was from him that Jarlaxle\u0027s minions acquired the Crystal Shard. They impersonated a priest of some renown and power, a cleric named Cadderly, I believe, who resides somewhere in or around the Snowflake Mountains.\"\\n\\n \"A long journey,\" the halfling remarked.\\n\\n \"A worthwhile one,\" Entreri replied. \"And we both know that distance is irrelevant to a wizard possessing the proper spells.\"\\n\\n \"This will cost you greatly.\"\\n\\n With just a twitch of his honed leg muscles, a movement that would have been difficult for a skilled fighter half his age, Entreri rose up tall and fearsome before Dwahvel, then leaned over and patted her on the shoulder-with his gloved right hand.\\n\\n She got the message. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/servant-of-the-shard-paths-of-darkness-3/page-11.html","bookId":2138,"book":{"id":2138,"title":"Servant of the Shard (Paths of Darkness #3)","description":"Storyline: Servant of the Shard (Paths of Darkness #3) \\n With each kill, I grow wiser, and with added wisdom, I grow stronger.
