{"id":95382,"no":18,"title":"Page 18","content":"A CALL FOR HELP\n There is something enjoyable about these beasts, I must admit,\" Jarlaxle noted when he and Entreri pulled up beside a mountain pass.\n The assassin quickly dismounted and ran to the ledge to view the trail below-and to view the band of orcs he suspected were still stubbornly in pursuit. The pair had left the desert behind, at long last, entering a region of broken hills and rocky trails.\n \"Though if I had one of my lizards from Menzoberran-zan, I could simply run away to the top of the hill and over the other side,\" the drow went on. He took off his great plumed hat and rubbed a hand over his bald head. The sun was strong this day, but the dark elf seemed to be handling it quite well-certainly better than Entreri would have expected of any drow under this blistering sun. Again the assassin had to wonder if Jarlaxle might have a bit of magic about him to protect his sensitive eyes. \"Useful beasts, the lizards of Menzoberranzan,\" Jarlaxle remarked. \"I should have brought some to the surface with me.\"\n Entreri gave him a smirk and a shake of his head. \"It will be hard enough getting into half the towns with a drow beside me,\" he remarked. \"How much more welcoming might they be if I rode in on a lizard?\"\n He looked back down the mountainside, and sure enough, the orc band was still pacing them, though the wretched creatures were obviously exhausted. Still, they followed as if compelled beyond their control.\n It wasn\u0027t hard for Artemis Entreri to figure out exactly what might be so compelling them.\n \"Why can you not just take out your magical tent, that we can melt away from them?\" Jarlaxle asked for the third time.\n \"The magic is limited,\" Entreri answered yet again. He glanced back at Jarlaxle as he replied, surprised that the cunning drow would keep asking the same question. Was Jarlaxle, perhaps, trying to garner some information about the tent? Or even worse, was the Crystal Shard reaching out to the drow, subtly asking him to goad Entreri in that direction? If they did take out the tent and disappear, after all, they would have to reappear in the same place. That being true, had the Crystal Shard figured out how to send its telepathic call across the planes of existence? Perhaps the next time Entreri and Jarlaxle used the plane- shifting tent, they would return to the material plane to find an orc army, inspired by Crenshinibon, waiting for them. \"The horses grow weary,\" Jarlaxle noted. \"They can outrun orcs,\" Entreri replied. \"If we let them run free, perhaps.\" \"They\u0027re just orcs,\" Entreri muttered, though he could hardly believe how persistent this group remained.\n He turned back to Jarlaxle, no longer doubting the drow\u0027s claim. The horses were indeed tired-they had been riding a long day before even realizing the orcs were following their trail. They had ridden the beasts practically into the desert sands in an effort to get out of that barren, wide-open region as quickly as possible. Perhaps it was time to stop running. \"There are only about a score of them,\" Entreri remarked, watching their movements as they crawled over the lower slopes.\n \"Twenty against two,\" Jarlaxle reminded. \"Let us go and hide in your tent, that the horses can rest, and come out and begin the chase anew.\"\n \"We can defeat them and drive them away,\" Entreri insisted, \"if we choose and prepare the battlefield.\"\n It surprised the assassin that Jarlaxle didn\u0027t look very eager about that possibility. \"They\u0027re only orcs,\" Entreri said again.\n \"Are they?\" Jarlaxle asked.\n Entreri started to respond but paused long enough to consider the meaning behind the dark elf\u0027s words. Was this pursuit a chance encounter? Or was there something more to this seemingly nondescript band of monsters?\n \"You believe that Kimmuriel and Rai-guy are secretly guiding this band,\" Entreri stated more than asked.\n Jarlaxle shrugged. \"Those two have always favored using monsters as fodder,\" he explained. \"They let the orcs-or kobolds, or whatever other creature is available- rush in to weary their opponents while they prepare the killing blow. It is nothing new in their tactics. They used such a ruse to take House Basadoni, forcing the kobolds to lead the charge and take the bulk of the casualties.\"\n \"It could be,\" Entreri agreed with a nod. \"Or it could be a conspiracy of another sort, one with its roots in our midst.\"\n It took Jarlaxle a few moments to sort that out. \"Do you believe that I have urged the orcs on?\" he asked.\n In response, Entreri patted the pouch that held the Crystal Shard. \"Perhaps Crenshinibon has come to believe that it needs to be rescued from our clutches,\" he said.\n \"The shard would prefer an orcish wielder to either you or me?\" Jarlaxle asked doubtfully.\n \"I am not its wielder, nor will I ever be,\" Entreri answered sharply. \"Nor will you, else you would have taken it from me our first night on the road from Dallabad, when I was too weak with my wounds to resist. I know this truth, so do you, and so does Crenshinibon. It understands that we are beyond its reach now, and it fears us, or fears me, at least, because it recognizes what is in my heart.\"\n He spoke the words with perfect calm and perfect coldness, and it wasn\u0027t hard for Jarlaxle to figure out what he might be talking about. \"You mean to destroy it,\" the drow remarked, and his tone made the sentence seem like an accusation.\n \"And I know how to do it,\" Entreri bluntly admitted. \"Or at least, I know someone who knows how to do it.\"\n The expressions that crossed Jarlaxle\u0027s handsome face ranged from incredulity to sheer anger to something less obvious, something buried deep. The assassin knew that he had taken a chance in proclaiming his intent so openly with the drow who had been fully duped by the Crystal Shard and who was still not completely convinced, despite Entreri\u0027s many reminders, that giving up the artifact had been a good thing to do. Was Jarlaxle\u0027s unreadable expression a signal to him that the Crystal Shard had indeed gotten to the drow leader once again and was even then working through, and with, Jarlaxle to find a way to get rid of Entreri\u0027s bothersome interference?\n \"You will never find the strength of heart to destroy it,\" Jarlaxle remarked.\n Now it was Entreri\u0027s turn to wear a confused expression. \"Even if you discover a method, and I doubt that there is one, when the moment comes, Artemis Entreri will never find the heart to be rid of so powerful and potentially gainful an item as Crenshinibon,\" Jarlaxle proclaimed slyly. A grin widened across the dark elf\u0027s face. \"I know you, Artemis Entreri,\" he said, grinning still, \"and I know that you\u0027ll not throw away such power and promise, such beauty as Crenshinibon!\"\n Entreri looked at him hard. \"Without the slightest hesitation,\" he said coldly. \"And so would you, had you not fallen under its spell. I see that enchantment for what it is, a trap of temporary gain through reckless action that can only lead to complete and utter ruin. You disappoint me, Jarlaxle. I had thought you smarter than this.\"\n Jarlaxle\u0027s expression, too, turned cold. A flash of anger lit his dark eyes. For just a moment, Entreri thought his first fight of the day was upon him, thought the dark elf would attack him. Jarlaxle closed his eyes, his body swaying as he focused his thoughts and his concentration.\n \"Fight the urge,\" the assassin found himself whispering under his breath. Entreri the consummate loner, the man who, for all his life, had counted on no one but himself, was surely surprised to hear himself now.\n \"Do we continue to run, or do we fight them?\" Jarlaxle asked a moment later. \"If these creatures are being guided by Rai-guy and Kimmuriel, we will learn of it soon enough- likely when we are fully engaged in battle. The odds of ten- to-one, of even twenty-to-one, against orcs on a mountain battlefield of our choosing does not frighten me in the least, but in truth, I do not wish to face my former lieutenants, even two-against-two. With his combination of wizardly and clerical powers, Rai-guy has variables enough to strike fear into the heart of Gromph Baenre, and there is nothing predictable, or even understandable, about many of Kimmuriel Oblo-dra\u0027s tactics. In all the years he has served me, I have not begun to sort the riddle that is Kimmuriel. I know only that he is extremely effective.\"\n \"Keep talking,\" Entreri muttered, looking back down at the orcs, who were much closer now, and at all the potential battlefield areas. \"You are making me wish that I had left you and the Crystal Shard behind.\"\n He caught a slight shift in Jarlaxle\u0027s expression as he said that, a subtle hint that perhaps the mercenary leader had been wondering all along why Entreri had bothered with both the theft and the rescue. If Entreri meant to destroy the Crystal Shard anyway, after all, why not just run away and leave it and the feud between Jarlaxle and his dangerous lieutenants behind?\n \"We will discuss that,\" Jarlaxle replied.\n \"Another time,\" Entreri said, trotting along the ledge to the right. \"We have much to do, and our orc friends are in a hurry.\"\n \"Headlong into doom,\" Jarlaxle remarked quietly. He slid off of his horse and moved to follow Entreri.\n Soon after, the pair had set up in a location on the northeastern side of the range, the steepest ascent. Jarlaxle worried that perhaps some of the orcs would come up from the other paths, the same ones they had taken, stealing from them the advantage of the higher ground, but Entreri was convinced that the artifact was calling out to the creatures insistently, and that they would alter their course to follow the most direct line to Crenshinibon. That line would take them up several high bluffs on this side of the hills, and along narrow and easily defensible trails.\n Sure enough, within a few minutes of attaining their new perch, Entreri and Jarlaxle spotted the obedient and eager orc band, scrambling over stony outcroppings below them.\n Jarlaxle began his customary chatting, but Entreri wasn\u0027t listening. He turned his thoughts inward, listening for the Crystal Shard, knowing that it was calling out to the orcs. He paid close heed to its subtle emanations, knowing them all too well from his time in possession of the item, for though he had denied the Crystal Shard, had made it as clear as possible that the artifact could offer him nothing, it had not relented its tempting call.\n He heard that call now, drifting out over the mountain passes, reaching out to the orcs and begging them to come and find the treasure.\n Halt the call, Entreri silently commanded the artifact. These creatures are not worthy to serve either you or me as slaves.\n He sensed it then, a moment of confusion from the artifact, a moment of fleeting hope-there, Entreri knew without the slightest of doubts, Crenshinibon did desire him as a wielder! - followed by... questions. Entreri seized the moment to interject his own thoughts into the stream of the telepathic call. He offered no words, for he didn\u0027t even speak Orcish, and doubted that the creatures would understand any of the human tongues he did speak, but merely imparted images of orc slaves, serving the master dark elf. He figured Jarlaxle would be a more imposing figure to orcs than he. Entreri showed them one orc being eaten by drow, another being beaten and torn apart with savage glee.\n \"What are you doing, my friend?\" he heard Jarlaxle\u0027s insistent call, in a loud voice that told him his drow companion had likely asked that same question several times already.\n \"Putting a little doubt into the minds of our ugly little camp-followers,\" Entreri replied. \"Joining Crenshinibon\u0027s call to them in the hopes that they will hardly sort out one lie from the other.\"\n Jarlaxle wore a perplexed expression indeed, and Entreri understood all the questions that were likely behind it, for he was harboring many of the same doubts. One lie from another indeed. Or were the promises of Crenshinibon truly lies? the assassin had to ask himself. Even beyond that fundamental confusion, the assassin understood that Jarlaxle would, and had to, fear Entreri\u0027s motivations. Was Entreri, perhaps, shading his words to Jarlaxle in a way that would make the mercenary drow come to agree with Entreri\u0027s assessment that he, and not the dark elf, should carry the Crystal Shard?\n \"Ignore whatever doubts Crenshinibon is now giving to you,\" Entreri said matter-of-factly, reading the dark elf\u0027s expression perfectly.\n \"Even if you speak the truth, I fear that you play a dangerous game with an artifact that is far beyond your understanding,\" Jarlaxle retorted after another introspective pause.\n \"I know what it is,\" Entreri assured him, \"and I know that it understands the truth of our relationship. That is why the Crystal Shard so desperately wants to be free of me- and is thus calling to you once more.\"\n Jarlaxle looked at him hard, and for just a moment, Entreri thought the drow might move against him.\n \"Do not disappoint me,\" the assassin said simply.\n Jarlaxle blinked, took off his hat, and rubbed the sweat from his bald head again.\n \"There!\" Entreri said, pointing down to the lower slopes, to where a fight had broken out between different factions among the orcs. Few of the ugly brutes seemed to be trying to make peace, as was the way with chaotic orcs. The slightest spark could ignite warfare within a tribe of the beasts that would continue at the cost of many lives until one side was simply wiped out. Entreri, with his imparted images of torture and slavery and images of a drow master, had done more than flick a little spark. \"It would seem that some of them heeded my call over that of the artifact.\"\n \"And I had thought this day would bring some excitement,\" Jarlaxle remarked. \"Shall we join them before they kill each other? To aid whichever side is losing, of course.\" \"And with our aid, that side will soon be winning,\" Entreri reasoned, and Jarlaxle\u0027s quick response came as no surprise.\n \"Of course,\" said the drow, \"we are then honor-bound to join in with the side that is losing. It could be a complicated afternoon.\"\n Entreri smiled as he worked his way around the ledge of the current perch, looking for a quick way down to the orcs.\n By the time the pair got close to the fighting, they realized that their estimates of a score of orcs had been badly mistaken. There were at least fifty of the beasts, all running around in a frenzy now, whacking at each other with abandon, using clubs, branches, sharpened sticks, and a few crafted weapons.\n Jarlaxle tipped his hat to the assassin, motioned for Entreri to go left, and went right, blending into the shadows so perfectly that Entreri had to blink to make sure they were not deceiving him. He knew that Jarlaxle, like all dark elves, was stealthy. Likewise he knew that while Jarlaxle\u0027s cloak was not the standard drow piwafwi, it did have many magical qualities. It surprised him that anyone, short of using a wizard\u0027s invisibility spell, could find a way so to completely hide that great plumed hat.\n Entreri shook it off and ran to the left, finding an easy path of shadows through the sparse trees, boulders, and rocky ridges. He approached the first group of orcs-four of the beasts squared up in battle, three against one. Moving silently, the assassin worked his way around the back of the trio, thinking to even up the odds with a sudden strike. He knew he was making no noise, knew he was hiding perfectly from tree to tree to rock to ridge. He had performed attacks like this for nearly three decades, had perfected the stealthy strike to an unprecedented level-and these were only orcs, simple, stupid brutes.\n How surprised Entreri was, then, when two of the fighting trio howled and leaped around, charging right for him. The orc they had been fighting, with complete disregard to the battle at hand, similarly charged at the assassin. The remaining orc opponent promptly cut it down as it ran past.\n Hard-pressed, Entreri worked his sword left and right, parrying the thrusts of the two makeshift spears and shearing the tip off one in the process. He was back on his heels, in a position of terrible balance. Had he been fighting an opponent of true skill he surely would have been killed, but these were only orcs. Their weapons were poorly crafted and their tactics were utterly predictable. He had defeated their first thrusts, their only chance, and yet, still they came on, headlong, with abandon.\n Charon\u0027s Claw waved before them, filling the air with an opaque wall of ash. They plunged right through-of course they did! - but Entreri had already skittered to the left, and he spun back behind the charge of the closest orc, plunging his dagger deep into the creature\u0027s side. He didn\u0027t retract the blade immediately, though he had broken free. He could have made an easy kill of the second stumbling orc. No, he used the dagger to draw out the life-force from the already dying creature, taking that life-force into his own body to speed the healing of his own previous wounds.\n By the time he let the limp creature drop to the ground, the second orc was at him, stabbing wildly. Entreri caught the spear with the crosspiece of his dagger and easily turned it up high, over his shoulder, and ducked and stepped ahead, shearing across with a great sweep of Charon\u0027s Claw. The orc instinctively tried to block with its arm, but the sword cut right through the limb, and drove hard into the orc\u0027s side, splintering ribs and tearing a great hole in its lung, all the way to its heart.\n Entreri could hardly believe that the third of the group was still charging at him after seeing how easily and completely he had destroyed its two companions. He casually planted his left foot against the chest of the drooping, dead creature impaled on his sword, and waited for the exact moment. When that moment came, he turned the dead orc and kicked it free, dropping it in the path of its charging, howling companion.\n The orc tripped, diving headlong past Entreri. The assassin stabbed up hard with the dagger, catching the orc under the chin and driving the blade up into its head. He bent as the heavy orc continued its facedown dive, ending with him holding the creature\u0027s head from the ground and the orc twitching spasmodically as it died.\n A twist and yank tore the dagger free, and Entreri paused only long enough to wipe both his blades on the dead beast\u0027s back before running off in pursuit of other prey.\n His stride was more tempered this time, though, for his failure in approaching the trio from behind bothered him greatly. He believed he understood what had happened-the Crystal Shard had called out a warning to the group-but the thought that carrying the cursed item left him without his favored mode of attack and his greatest ability to defend himself was more than a little unsettling.\n He charged across the side of the rock facing, picking shadows where he could find them but worrying little about cover. He understood that with the Crystal Shard on his belt, he was likely as obvious as he would be sitting beside a blazing campfire on a dark night. He came past one small area of brush onto the lower edge of sloping, bare stone. Cursing the open ground but hardly slowing, Entreri started across.\n He saw the charge of another orc out of the corner of his eye, the creature rushing headlong at him, one arm back and ready to launch a spear his way.\n The orc was barely five strides away when it threw, but Entreri didn\u0027t even have to parry the errant missile, just letting it fly harmlessly past. He did react to it, though, with dramatic movement, and that only spurred on the eager orc attacker.\n It leaped at the seemingly vulnerable man, a flying tackle aimed for Entreri\u0027s waist. Two quick steps took the assassin out of harm\u0027s way, and he swished his sword down onto the orc\u0027s back as it flew past, cracking the powerful weapon right through the creature\u0027s backbone. The orc skidded down hard on its face, its upper torso and arms squirming wildly, but its legs making no movement of their own.\n Entreri didn\u0027t even bother finishing the wretched creature. He just ran on. He had a direction sorted for his run, for he heard the unmistakable laughter of a drow who seemed to be having too much fun.\n He found Jarlaxle standing atop a boulder amidst the largest tumult of battling orcs, spurring one side on with excited words that Entreri could not understand, while systematically cutting down their opponents with dagger after thrown dagger.\n Entreri stopped in the shadow of a tree and watched the spectacle.\n Sure enough, Jarlaxle soon changed sides, calling out to the other orcs, and launching that endless stream of daggers at members of the side he had just been urging on.\n The numbers dwindled, obviously so, and eventually, even the stupid orcs caught on to the deadly ruse. As one, they turned on Jarlaxle.\n The drow only laughed at them all the harder as a dozen spears came his way-every one of them missing the mark badly due to the displacement magic in the drow\u0027s cloak and the bad aim of the orcs. The drow countered, throwing one dagger after another. Jarlaxle spun around on his high perch, always seeking the closest orc, and always hitting home with a nearly perfect throw.\n Out of the shadows came Entreri, a whirlwind of fury, dagger working efficiently, but sword waving wildly, building walls of floating ash as the assassin sliced up the battlefield to suit his designs. Inevitably, Entreri worked his way into a situation that put him one-on-one against an orc. Just as inevitably, that creature was down and dying within the span of a few thrusts and stabs.\n Entreri and Jarlaxle walked slowly back up the mountain slope soon after, with the drow complaining at the meager take of silver pieces they had found on the orcs. Entreri was hardly listening, was more concerned with the call that had brought the creatures to them in the first place-the plea, the scream, for help from Crenshinibon. These were just a rag-tag band of orcs, but what more powerful creatures might the Crystal Shard find to come to its call next?\n \"The call of the shard is strong,\" he admitted to Jarlaxle,\n \"It has existed for centuries,\" the drow answered. \"It knows well how to preserve itself.\"\n \"That existence is soon to end,\" Entreri said grimly.\n \"Why?\" Jarlaxle asked with perfect innocence.\n The tone more than the word stopped Entreri cold in his tracks and made him turn around to regard his surprising companion.\n \"Do we have to go through this all over again?\" the assassin asked.\n \"My friend, I know why you believe the Crystal Shard to be unacceptable for either of us to wield, but why does that translate into the need to destroy it?\" Jarlaxle asked. He paused and glanced around, and motioned for Entreri to follow and led the assassin to the edge of a fairly deep ravine, a remote valley. \"Why not just throw it away then?\" he asked. \"Toss it from this cliff and let it land where it may?\"\n Entreri stared out at the remote vale and almost considered taking Jarlaxle\u0027s advice. Almost, but a very real truth rang clear in his mind. \"Because it would find its way back to the hands of our adversaries soon enough,\" he replied. \"The Crystal Shard saw great potential in Rai-guy,\"\n Jarlaxle nodded. \"Sensible,\" he said. \"Ever was that one too ambitious for his own good. Why do you care, though? Let Rai-guy have it and have all of Calimport, if the artifact can deliver the city to him. What does it matter to Artemis Entreri, who is gone from that place, and who will not return anytime soon in any event? Likely, my former lieutenant will be too preoccupied with the potential gains he might find with the artifact in his hands even to worry about our whereabouts. Perhaps freeing ourselves of the burden of the artifact will indeed save us from the pursuit we now fear at our backs.\"\n Entreri spent a long moment musing over that reasoning, but one fact kept nagging at him. \"The Crystal Shard knows I wish to see it destroyed,\" he replied, \"It knows that in my heart I hate it and will find some way to be rid of the thing. Rai-guy knows the threat that is Jarlaxle. As long as you live, he can never be certain of his position within Bregan D\u0027aerthe. What would happen if Jarlaxle reappeared in Menzoberranzan, reaching out to old comrades against the fools who tried to steal the throne of Bregan D\u0027aerthe?\"\n Jarlaxle offered no response, but the twinkle in his dark eyes told Entreri that his drow companion would like nothing more than to play out that very scenario.\n \"He wants you dead,\" Entreri said bluntly. \"He needs you dead, and with the Crystal Shard at his disposal, that might not prove to be an overly difficult task.\"\n The twinkle in Jarlaxle\u0027s dark eyes remained, but after a moment\u0027s thought, he just shrugged and said, \"Lead on.\"\n Entreri did just that, back to their horses and back to the trails that would take them to the northeast, to the Snowflake Mountains and the Spirit Soaring. Entreri was quite pleased with the way he had handled Jarlaxle, quite pleased in the strength of his argument for destroying the Crystal Shard.\n But it was all just so much dung, he knew, all a justification for that which was in his heart. Yes, he was determined to destroy the Crystal Shard, and would see the artifact obliterated, but it was not for any fear of retribution or of pursuit. Entreri wanted Crenshinibon destroyed simply because the mere existence of the dominating artifact revolted him. The Crystal Shard, in trying to coerce him, had insulted him profoundly. He didn\u0027t hold any notion that the wretched world would be a better place without the artifact, and hardly cared whether it would be or not, but he did believe that he would more greatly enjoy his existence in the world knowing that one less wretched and perverted item such as the Crystal Shard remained in existence.\n Of course, as Entreri harbored these thoughts, Crenshinibon realized them as well. The Crystal Shard could\n only seethe, could only hope that it might find someone weaker of heart and stronger of arm to slay Artemis Entreri and free it from his grasp. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/servant-of-the-shard-paths-of-darkness-3/page-18.html","bookId":2138,"book":{"id":2138,"title":"Servant of the Shard (Paths of Darkness #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Servant of the Shard (Paths of Darkness #3) \n With each kill, I grow wiser, and with added wisdom, I grow stronger.
