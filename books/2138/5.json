{"id":95369,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"MANY ROADS TO MANY PLACES\n Entreri stood in the shadows of the doorway, listening with great curiosity to the soliloquy taking place in the room. He could only make out small pieces of the oration. The speaker, Jarlaxle, was talking quickly and excitedly in the drow tongue. Entreri, in addition to his limited Deep Drow vocabulary, couldn\u0027t hear every word from this distance.\n \"They will not stay ahead of us, because we move too quickly,\" the mercenary leader remarked. Entreri heard and was able to translate every word of that line, for it seemed as if Jarlaxle was cheering someone on. \"Yes, street by street they will fall. Who can stand against us joined?\"\n \"Us joined?\" the assassin silently echoed, repeating the drow word over and over to make sure that he was translating it properly. Us? Jarlaxle could not be speaking of his alliance with Entreri, or even with the remnants of the Basadoni Guild. Compared to the strength of Bregan D\u0027aerthe, these were minor additions. Had Jarlaxle made some new deal, then, without Entreri\u0027s knowledge? A deal with some pasha, perhaps, or an even greater power?\n The assassin bent in closer, listening particularly for any names of demons or devils-or of illithids, perhaps. He shuddered at the thought of any of the three. Demons were too unpredictable and too savage to serve any alliance. They would do whatever served their specific needs at any particular moment, without regard for the greater benefit to the alliance. Devils were more predictable- were too predictable. In their hierarchical view of the world, they inevitably sat on top of the pile.\n Still, compared to the third notion that had come to him, that of the illithids, Entreri was almost hoping to hear Jarlaxle utter the name of a mighty demon. Entreri had been forced to deal with illithids during his stay in Menzoberranzan-the mind flayers were an unavoidable side of life in the drow city-and he had no desire to ever, ever, see one of the squishy-headed, wretched creatures again.\n He listened a bit longer, and Jarlaxle seemed to calm down and to settle more comfortably into his seat. The mercenary leader was still talking, just muttering to himself about the impending downfall of the Rakers, when Entreri strode into the room.\n \"Alone?\" the assassin asked innocently. \"I thought I heard voices.\"\n He noted with some relief that Jarlaxle wasn\u0027t wearing his magical, protective eye patch this day, which made it unlikely that the drow had just encountered, or soon planned to encounter, any illithids. The eye patch protected against mind magic, and none in all the world were more proficient at such things as the dreaded mind flayers.\n \"Sorting things out,\" Jarlaxle explained, and his ease with the common tongue of the surface world seemed no less fluent than that of his native language. \"There is so much afoot.\"\n \"Danger, mostly,\" Entreri replied.\n \"For some,\" said Jarlaxle with a chuckle.\n Entreri looked at him doubtfully.\n \"Surely you do not believe that the Rakers can match our power?\" the mercenary leader asked incredulously.\n \"Not in open battle,\" Entreri answered, \"but that is how it has been with them for many years. They cannot match many, blade to blade, and yet they have ever found a way to survive.\"\n \"Because they are fortunate.\"\n \"Because they are intricately tied to greater powers,\" Entreri corrected. \"A man need not be physically powerful if he is guarded by a giant.\"\n \"Unless the giant has more tightly befriended a rival,\" Jarlaxle interjected. \"And giants are known to be unreliable.\"\n \"You have arranged this with the greater lords of Calimport?\" Entreri asked, unconvinced. \"With whom, and why was I not involved in such a negotiation?\"\n Jarlaxle shrugged, offering not a clue.\n \"Impossible,\" Entreri decided. \"Even if you threatened one or more of them, the Rakers are too long-standing, too entrenched in the power web of all Calimshan, for such treachery against them to prosper. They have allies to protect them against other allies. There is no way that even Jarlaxle and Bregan D\u0027aerthe could have cleared the opposition to such a sudden and destabilizing shift in the power structure of the region as the decimation of the Rakers.\"\n \"Perhaps I have allied with the most powerful being ever to come to Calimport,\" Jarlaxle said dramatically, and typically, cryptically.\n Entreri narrowed his dark eyes and stared at the outrageous drow, looking for clues, any clues, as to what this uncharacteristic behavior might herald. Jarlaxle was often cryptic, always mysterious, and ever ready to grab at an opportunity that would bring him greater power or profits, and yet, something seemed out of place here. To Entreri\u0027s thinking, the impending assault on the Rakers was a blunder, which was something the legendary Jarlaxle never did. It seemed obvious, then, that the cunning drow had indeed made some powerful connection or ally, or was possessed of some deeper understanding of the situation. This Entreri doubted since he, not Jarlaxle, was the best connected person on Calimport\u0027s streets.\n Even given one of those possibilities, though, something just didn\u0027t seem quite right to Entreri. Jarlaxle was cocky and arrogant-of course he was! - but never before had he seemed this self-assured, especially in a situation as potentially explosive as this.\n The situation seemed only more explosive if Entreri looked beyond the inevitability of the downfall of the Rakers. He knew well the murderous power of the dark elves and held no doubt that Bregan D\u0027aerthe would slaughter the competing guild, but there were so many implications to that victory-too many, certainly, for Jarlaxle to be so comfortable.\n \"Has your role in this been determined?\" Jarlaxle asked.\n \"No role,\" Entreri answered, and his tone left no doubt that he was pleased by that fact. \"Rai-guy and Kimmuriel have all but cast me aside.\"\n Jarlaxle laughed aloud, for the truth behind that statement-that Entreri had been willingly cast aside- was all too obvious.\n Entreri stared at him and didn\u0027t crack a smile. Jarlaxle had to know the dangers he had just walked into, a potentially catastrophic situation that could send him and Bregan D\u0027aerthe fleeing back to the dark hole of Menzoberranzan. Perhaps that was it, the assassin mused. Perhaps Jarlaxle longed for home and was slyly facilitating the move. The mere thought of that made Entreri wince. Better that Jarlaxle kill him outright than drag him back there.\n Perhaps Entreri would be set up as an agent, as was Morik in Luskan. No, the assassin decided, that would not suffice. Calimport was more dangerous than Luskan, and if the power of Bregan D\u0027aerthe was forced away, he would not take such a risk. Too many powerful enemies would be left behind.\n \"It will begin soon, if it has not already,\" Jarlaxle remarked. \"Thus, it will be over soon.\"\n Sooner than you believe, Entreri thought, but he kept silent. He was a man who survived through careful calculation, by weighing scrupulously the consequences of every step and every word. He knew Jarlaxle to be a kindred spirit, but he could not reconcile that with the action that was being undertaken this very night, which, in searching it from any angle, seemed a tremendous and unnecessary gamble.\n What did Jarlaxle know that he did not?\n No one ever looked more out of place anywhere than did Sharlotta Vespers as she descended the rung ladder into one of Calimport\u0027s sewers. She was wearing her trademark long gown, her hair neatly coiffed as always, her exotic face painted delicately to emphasize her brown, almond-shaped eyes. Still, she was quite at home there, and anyone who knew her would not have been surprised to find her there.\n Especially if they considered her warlord escorts.\n \"What word from above?\" Rai-guy asked her, speaking quickly and in the drow tongue. The wizard, despite his misgivings about Sharlotta, was impressed by how quickly she had absorbed the language.\n \"There is tension,\" Sharlotta replied. \"The doors of many guilds are locked fast this night. Even the Copper Ante is accepting no patrons-an unprecedented event. The streets know that something is afoot.\"\n Rai-guy flashed a sour look at Kimmuriel. The two had just agreed that their plans depended mostly on stealth and surprise, that all of the elements of the Basadoni Guild and Bregan D\u0027aerthe would have to reach their objectives nearly simultaneously to ensure that few witnesses remained.\n How much this seemed like Menzoberranzan! In the drow city, one house going after another-a not-uncommon event- would measure success not only by the result of the actual fighting, but by the lack of credible witnesses left to produce evidence of the treachery. Even if every drow in the great city knew without doubt which house had precipitated the battle, no action would ever be taken unless the evidence demanding it was overwhelming.\n But this was not Menzoberranzan, Rai-guy reminded himself. Up here, suspicion would invite investigation. In the drow city, suspicion without undeniable evidence only invited quiet praise.\n \"Our warriors are in place,\" Kimmuriel remarked. \"The drow are beneath the guild houses, with force enough to batter through, and the Basadoni soldiers have surrounded the main three buildings. It will be swift, for they cannot anticipate the attack from below.\"\n Rai-guy kept his gaze upon Sharlotta as his associate detailed the situation, and he did not miss a slight arch of one of her eyebrows. Had Bregan D\u0027aerthe been betrayed? Were the Rakers setting up defenses against the assault from below?\n \"The agents have been isolated?\" the drow wizard pressed to Sharlotta, referring to the first round of the invasion: the fight with-or rather, the assassinations of- Raker spies in the streets.\n \"The agents are not to be found,\" Sharlotta replied matter-of-factly, a surprising tone given the enormity of the implications.\n Again Rai-guy glanced at Kimmuriel.\n \"All is in place,\" the psionicist reminded.\n \"Keego\u0027s swarm cramps the tunnels,\" Rai-guy replied, his words an archaic drow proverb referring to a long-ago battle in which an overwhelming swarm of goblins led by the crafty, rebellious slave, Keego, had been utterly destroyed by a small and sparsely populated city of dark elves. The drow had gone out from their homes to catch the larger force in the tight tunnels beyond the relatively open drow city. Simply translated, given the current situation, Rai-guy\u0027s words followed up Kimmuriel\u0027s remark. All was in place to fight the wrong battle.\n Sharlotta looked at the wizard curiously, and he understood her confusion, for the soldiers of Bregan D\u0027aerthe waiting in the tunnels beneath the Rakers\u0027 houses hardly constituted a \"swarm.\"\n Of course, Rai-guy hardly cared whether Sharlotta understood or not.\n \"Have we traced the course of the missing agents?\" Rai- guy asked Sharlotta. \"Do we know where they have fled?\"\n \"Back to the houses, likely,\" the woman replied. \"Few are on the streets this night.\"\n Again, the less-than-subtle hint that too much had been revealed. Had Sharlotta herself betrayed them? Rai-guy fought the urge to interrogate her on the spot, using drow torture techniques that would quickly and efficiently break down any human. If he did so, he knew, he would have to answer to Jarlaxle, and Rai-guy was not ready for that fight... yet.\n If he called it all off at that critical moment-if all the fighters, Basadoni and dark elf, returned to the guild house with their weapons unstained by Raker blood- Jarlaxle would not be pleased. The drow was determined to see this conquest through despite the protests of all of his lieutenants.\n Rai-guy closed his eyes and logically sifted through the situation, trying to find some safer common ground. There was one Raker house far removed from the others, and likely only lightly manned. While destroying it would do little to weaken the structure and effectiveness of the opposition guild, perhaps such a conquest would quiet Jarlaxle\u0027s expected rampage.\n \"Recall the Basadoni soldiers,\" the wizard ordered. \"Have their retreat be a visible one-instruct some to enter the Copper Ante or other establishments.\"\n \"The Copper Ante\u0027s doors are closed,\" Sharlotta reminded him.\n \"Then open them,\" Rai-guy instructed. \"Tell Dwahvel Tiggerwillies that there is no need for her and her diminutive clan to cower this night. Let our soldiers be seen about the streets-not as a unified fighting force, but in smaller groups.\"\n \"What of Bregan D\u0027aerthe?\" Kimmuriel asked with some concern. Not as much concern, Rai-guy noted, as he would have expected, given that he had just countermanded Jarlaxle\u0027s explicit orders.\n \"Reposition Berg\u0027inyon and all of our magic-users to the eighth position,\" Rai-guy replied, referring to the sewer hold beneath the exposed Raker house.\n Kimmuriel arched his white eyebrows at that. They knew the maximum resistance they could expect from that lone outpost, and it hardly seemed as if Berg\u0027inyon and more magic-users would be needed to win out easily in that locale.\n \"It must be executed as completely and carefully as if we were attacking House Baenre itself,\" Rai-guy demanded, and Kimmuriel\u0027s eyebrows went even higher. \"Redefine the plans and reposition all necessary drow forces to execute the attack.\"\n \"We could summon our kobold slaves alone to finish this task,\" Kimmuriel replied derisively.\n \"No kobolds and no humans,\" Rai-guy explained, emphasizing every word. \"This is work for drow alone.\"\n Kimmuriel seemed to catch on to Rai-guy\u0027s thinking then, for a wry smile showed on his face. He glanced at Sharlotta, nodded back at Rai-guy, and closed his eyes. He used his psionic energies to reach out to Berg\u0027inyon and the other Bregan D\u0027aerthe field commanders.\n Rai-guy let his gaze settle fully on Sharlotta. To her credit, her expression and posture did not reveal her thoughts. Still, Rai-guy felt certain she was wondering if he had come to suspect her or some other Raker informant.\n \"You said that our power would prove overwhelming,\" Sharlotta remarked.\n \"For today\u0027s battle, perhaps,\" Rai-guy replied. \"The wise thief does not steal the egg if his action will awaken the dragon.\"\n Sharlotta continued to stare at him, continued to wonder, he knew. He enjoyed the realization that this too- clever human woman, guilty or not, was suddenly worried. She turned for the ladder again and took a step up.\n \"Where are you going?\" Rai-guy asked.\n \"To recall the Basadoni soldiers,\" she replied, as if the explanation should have been obvious.\n Rai-guy shook his head and motioned for her to step down. \"Kimmuriel will relay the commands,\" he said.\n Sharlotta hesitated-Rai-guy enjoyed the moment of confusion and concern-but she did step back down to the tunnel floor.\n Berg\u0027inyon could not believe the change in plans-what was the point of this entire offensive if the bulk of the Rakers\u0027 Guild escaped the onslaught? He had grown up in\n Menzoberranzan, and in that matriarchal society, males learned how to take orders without question. So it was now for Berg\u0027inyon.\n He had been trained in the finest battle tactics of the greatest house of Menzoberranzan and had at his disposal a seemingly overwhelming force for the task at hand, the destruction of a small, exposed Raker house-an outpost sitting on unfriendly streets. Despite his trepidation at the change in plans, his private questioning of the purpose of this mission, Berg\u0027inyon Baenre wore an eager smile.\n The scouts, the stealthiest of the stealthy drow, returned. Only minutes before, they had been inserted into the house above through wizard-made tunnels.\n Drow fingers flashed, the silent hand gesture code.\n While Berg\u0027inyon\u0027s confidence mounted, so did his confusion over why this target alone had been selected. There were only a score of humans in the small house above, and none of them seemed to be magic-users. According to the drow scouts\u0027 assessment they were street thugs-men who survived by keeping to favorable shadows.\n Under the keen eyes of a dark elf, there were no favorable shadows.\n While Berg\u0027inyon and his army had a strong idea of what they would encounter in the house above them, the humans could not understand the monumental doom that lay below them.\n You have outlined to the group commanders all routes of retreat? Berg\u0027inyon\u0027s fingers and facial gestures asked. He made it clear from the fact that he signaled retreat with his left hand that he was referring to any possible avenues their enemies might take to run away.\n The wizards are positioned accordingly, one scout silently replied.\n The lead hunters have been given their courses, another added.\n Berg\u0027inyon nodded, flashed the signal for commencing the operation, then moved to join his assault group. His would be the last group to enter the building, but they were the ones who would cut the fastest path to the very top.\n There were two wizards in Berg\u0027inyon\u0027s group. One stood with his eyes closed, ready to convey the signal. The other positioned himself accordingly, his eyes and hands pointed up at the ceiling, a pinch of seeds from the Under-dark selussi fungus in one hand.\n It is time, came a magical whisper, one that seeped through the walls and to the ears of all the drow.\n The magic-user eyeing the ceiling began his spell- casting, weaving his hands as if tracing joining semicircles with each, thumbs touching, little fingers touching, back and forth, back and forth, chanting quietly all the while.\n He finished with a chant that sounded more like a hiss, and reached his outstretched fingers to the ceiling.\n That part of the stone ceiling began to ripple, as if the wizard had stabbed his fingers into clear water. The wizard held the pose for many seconds. The rippling increased until the stone became an indistinct blur.\n The stone above the wizard disappeared-was just gone. In its place was an upward reaching corridor that cut through several feet of stone to end at the ground floor of the Raker house.\n One unfortunate Raker had been caught by surprise, his heels right over the edge of the suddenly appearing hole. His arms worked great circles as he tried to maintain his balance. The drow warriors shifted into position under the hole and leaped. Enacting their innate drow levitation abilities, they floated up, up.\n The first dark elf floating up beside the falling Raker grabbed him by the collar and yanked him backward, tumbling him into the hole. The human managed to land in a controlled manner, feet first, then buckling his legs and tumbling to the side to absorb the shock. He came up with equal grace, drawing a dagger.\n His face blanched when he saw the truth about him: dark elves-drow! - were floating up into his guild house. Another drow, handsome and strong, holding the finest-edged blade the Raker could ever have imagined, faced him.\n Maybe he tried to reason with the dark elf, offering his surrender, but while his mouth worked in a logical, hide- saving manner, his body, paralyzed by stark terror, did not. He still held his knife out before him as he spoke, and since Berg\u0027inyon did not understand well the language of the surface dwellers, he had no way of understanding the Raker\u0027s intent.\n Nor was the drow about to pause to figure it out. His fine sword stabbed forward and slashed down, taking the dagger and the hand that held it. A quick retraction re- gathered his balance and power, and out went the sword again. Straight and sure, it tore through flesh and sliced rib, biting hard at the foolish man\u0027s heart.\n The man fell, quite dead, and still wearing that curious, stunned expression.\n Berg\u0027inyon didn\u0027t pause long enough to wipe his blade. He crouched, sprang straight up, and levitated fast into the house. His encounter had delayed him no more than a span of a few heartbeats, and yet, the floor of the room and the corridor beyond the open door was already littered with human corpses.\n Berg\u0027inyon\u0027s team exited the room soon after, before the wizard\u0027s initial passwall spell had even expired. Not a drow had been more than slightly injured and not a human remained alive. The Raker house held no treasure when they were done- not even the few coins several of the guildsmen had secretly tucked under loose floorboards-and even the furniture was gone. Magical fires had consumed every foot of flooring and all of the partitioning walls. From the outside, the house seemed quiet and secure. Inside, it was no more than a charred and empty husk.\n Bregan D\u0027aerthe had spoken.\n \"I accept no accolades,\" Berg\u0027inyon Baenre remarked when he met up with Rai-guy, Kimmuriel, and Sharlotta. It was a common drow saying, with clear implications that the vanquished opponent was not worthy enough for the victor to take any pride in having defeated him.\n Kimmuriel gave a wry smile. \"The house was effectively purged,\" he said. \"None escaped. You performed as was required. There is no glory in that, but there is acceptance.\"\n As he had done all day, Rai-guy continued his scrutiny of Sharlotta Vespers. Was the human woman even comprehending the sincerity of Kimmuriel\u0027s words, and if so, did that allow her any insight into the true power that had come to Calimport? For any guild to so completely annihilate one of another\u0027s houses was no small feat- unless the attacking guild happened to be comprised of drow warriors who understood the complexities of inter-house warfare better than any race in all the world. Did Sharlotta recognize this? And if she did, would she be foolish enough to try to use it to her advantage?\n Her expression now was mostly stone-faced, but with just a trace of intrigue, a hint to Rai-guy that the answer would be yes, to both questions. The drow wizard smiled at that, a confirmation that Sharlotta Vespers was walking onto very dangerous ground. Quiensin ful biezz coppon quangolth cree, a drow, went the old saying in Menzoberranzan, and elsewhere in the drow world. Doomed are those who believe they understand the designs of the drow.\n \"What did Jarlaxle learn to change his course so?\" Berg\u0027inyon asked.\n \"Jarlaxle has learned nothing of yet,\" Rai-guy replied. \"He chose to remain behind. The operation was mine to wage.\"\n Berg\u0027inyon started to redirect his question to Rai-guy then, but he stopped in midsentence and merely offered a bow to the appointed leader.\n \"Perhaps later you will explain to me the source of your decision, that I will better understand our enemies,\" he said respectfully.\n Rai-guy gave a slight nod.\n There is the matter of explaining to Jarlaxle,\" Sharlotta remarked, in her surprising command of the drow tongue. \"He will not accept your course with a mere bow.\"\n Rai-guy\u0027s gaze darted over at Berg\u0027inyon as she finished, quickly enough to catch the moment of anger flash through his red-glowing eyes. Sharlotta\u0027s observations were correct, of course, but coming from a non-drow, an iblith- which was also the drow word for excrement- they intrinsically cast an insulting reflection upon Berg\u0027inyon, who had so accepted the offered explanation. It was a minor mistake, but a few more quips like that against the young Baenre, Rai-guy knew, and there would remain too little of Sharlotta Vespers for anyone ever to make a proper identification of the pieces.\n \"We must tell Jarlaxle,\" the drow wizard put in, moving the conversation forward. \"To us out here, the course change was obviously required, but he has secluded himself, too much so perhaps, to view things that way.\"\n Kimmuriel and Berg\u0027inyon both looked at him curiously- why would he speak so plainly in front of Sharlotta, after all? - but Rai-guy gave them a quick and quiet signal to follow along.\n \"We could implicate Domo and the wererats,\" Kimmuriel put in, obviously catching on. \"Though I fear that we will then have to waste our time in slaughtering them.\" He looked to Sharlotta. \"Much of this will fall to you.\"\n \"The Basadoni soldiers were the first to leave the fight,\" Rai-guy added. \"And they will be the ones to return without blood on their blades.\" Now all three gazes fell upon Sharlotta.\n The woman held her outward calm quite well. \"Domo and the wererats, then,\" she agreed, thinking things through, obviously, as she went. \"We will implicate them without faulting them. Yes, that is the way. Perhaps they did not know of our plans and coincidentally hired on with Pasha Da\u0027Daclan to guard the sewers. As we did not wish to reveal ourselves fully to the coward Domo, we held to the unguarded regions, mostly around the eighth position.\"\n The three drow exchanged looks, and nodded for her to continue.\n \"Yes,\" Sharlotta went on, gathering momentum and confidence. \"I can turn this into an advantage with Pasha Da\u0027Daclan as well. He felt the press of impending doom, no doubt, and that fear will only heighten when word of the utterly destroyed outer house reaches him. Perhaps he will come to believe that Domo is much more powerful than any of us believed, and that he was in league with the Basadonis, and that only House Basadoni\u0027s former dealings with the Rakers cut short the assault.\"\n \"But will that not implicate House Basadoni clearly in the one executed attack?\" asked Kimmuriel, playing the role of Rai-guy\u0027s mouthpiece, drawing Sharlotta in even deeper. \"Not that we played a role, but only that we allowed it to happen,\" Sharlotta reasoned. \"A turn of our heads in response to their increased spying efforts against our guild. Yes, and if this is conveyed properly, it will only serve to make Domo seem even more powerful. If we make the Rakers believe that they were on the edge of complete disaster, they will behave more reasonably, and Jarlaxle will find his victory.\" She smiled as she finished, and the three dark elves returned the look.\n \"Begin,\" Rai-guy offered, waving his hand toward the ladder leading out of their sewer quarters.\n Sharlotta smiled again, the ignorant fool, and left them.\n \"Her deception against Pasha Da\u0027Daclan will necessarily extend, to some level, to Jarlaxle,\" Kimmuriel remarked, clearly envisioning the web Sharlotta was foolishly weaving about herself.\n \"You have come to fear that something is not right with Jarlaxle,\" Berg\u0027inyon bluntly remarked, for it was obvious that these two would not normally act so independently of their leader.\n \"His views have changed,\" Kimmuriel responded. \"You did not wish to come to the surface,\" Berg\u0027inyon said with a wry smile that seemed to question the motives of his companions\u0027 reasoning.\n \"No, and glad will we be to see the heat of Narbondel again,\" Rai-guy agreed, speaking of the great glowing clock of Menzoberranzan, a pillar that revealed its measurements with heat to the dark elves, who viewed the Underdark world in the infrared spectrum of light. \"You have not been up here long enough to appreciate the ridiculousness of this place. Your heart will call you home soon enough.\"\n \"Already,\" Berg\u0027inyon replied. \"I have no taste for this world, nor do I like the sight or smell of any I have seen up here, Sharlotta Vespers least of all.\"\n \"Her and the fool Entreri,\" said Rai-guy. \"Yet Jarlaxle favors them both.\"\n \"His tenure in Bregan D\u0027aerthe may be nearing its end,\" said Kimmuriel, and both Berg\u0027inyon and Rai-guy opened their eyes wide at such a bold proclamation.\n In truth, though, both were harboring the exact same sentiments. Jarlaxle had reached far in merely bringing them to the surface. Perhaps he\u0027d reached too far for the rogue band to continue to hold much favor among their former associates, including most of the great houses back in Menzoberranzan. It was a gamble, and one that might indeed pay off, especially as the flow of exotic and desirable goods increased to the city.\n The plan, however, had been for a short stay, only long enough to establish a few agents to properly facilitate the flow of trade. Jarlaxle had stepped in more deeply then, conquering House Basadoni and renewing his ties with the dangerous Entreri. Then, seemingly for his own amusement, Jarlaxle had gone after the most hated rogue, Drizzt Do\u0027Urden. After completing his business with the outcast and stealing the mighty artifact Crenshinibon, he had let Drizzt walk away, had even forced Rai-guy to use a Lolth-bestowed spell of healing to save the miserable renegade\u0027s life.\n And now this, a more overt grab for not profit but power, and in a place where none of Bregan D\u0027aerthe other than Jarlaxle wished to remain.\n Jarlaxle had taken small steps along this course, but he had put a long and winding road behind him. He brought all of Bregan D\u0027aerthe further and further from their continuing mission, from the allure that had brought most of the members, Rai-guy, Kimmuriel, and Berg\u0027inyon among them, into the organization in the first place.\n \"What of Sharlotta Vespers?\" Kimmuriel asked.\n \"Jarlaxle will eliminate that problem for us,\" Rai-guy replied.\n \"Jarlaxle favors her,\" Berg\u0027inyon reminded.\n \"She just entered into a deception against him,\" Rai-guy replied with all confidence. \"We know this, and she knows that we know, though she has not yet considered\n the potentially devastating implications. She will follow our commands from this point forward.\"\n The drow wizard smiled as he considered his own words. He always enjoyed seeing an iblith fall into the web of drow society, learning piece by piece that the sticky strands were layered many levels deep.\n \"I know of your hunger, for I share in it,\" Jarlaxle remarked. \"This is not as I had envisioned, but perhaps it was not yet time.\"\n Perhaps you place too much faith in your lieutenants, the voice in his head replied.\n \"No, they saw something that we, in our hunger, did not,\" Jarlaxle reasoned. \"They are troublesome, often annoying, and not to be trusted when their personal gain is at odds with their given mission, but that was not the case here. I must examine this more carefully. Perhaps there are better avenues toward our desired goal.\"\n The voice started to respond, but the drow mercenary cut short the dialogue, shutting it out.\n The abruptness of that dismissal reminded Crenshinibon that its respect for the dark elf was well-placed. This Jarlaxle was as strong of will and as difficult to beguile as any wielder the ancient sentient artifact had ever known, even counting the great demon lords who had often joined with Crenshinibon through the centuries.\n In truth, the only wielder the artifact had ever known who could so readily and completely shut out its call had been the immediate predecessor to Jarlaxle, another drow, Drizzt Do\u0027Urden. That one\u0027s mental barrier had been constructed of morals. Crenshinibon would have been no better off in the hands of a goodly priest or a paladin, fools all and blind to the need to attain the greatest levels of power.\n All that only made Jarlaxle\u0027s continued resistance even more impressive, for the artifact understood that this one held no such conscience-based mores. There was no intrinsic understanding within Jarlaxle that Crenshinibon was some evil creation and thus to be avoided out of hand. No, to Crenshinibon\u0027s reasoning, Jarlaxle viewed everyone and everything he encountered as tools, as vehicles to carry him along his desired road.\n The artifact could build forks along that road, and perhaps even sharper turns as Jarlaxle wandered farther and farther from the path, but there would be no abrupt change in direction at this time.\n Crenshinibon, the Crystal Shard, did not even consider seeking a new wielder, as it had often done when confronting obstacles in the past. While it sensed resistance in Jarlaxle, that resistance did not implicate danger or even inactivity. To the sentient artifact, Jarlaxle was powerful and intriguing, and full of the promise of the greatest levels of power Crenshinibon had ever known.\n The fact that this drow was not a simple instrument of chaos and destruction, as were so many of the demon lords, or an easily duped human-perhaps the most redundant thought the artifact had ever considered-only made him more interesting.\n They had a long way to go together, Crenshinibon believed.\n The artifact would find its greatest level of power. The world would suffer greatly. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/servant-of-the-shard-paths-of-darkness-3/page-5.html","bookId":2138,"book":{"id":2138,"title":"Servant of the Shard (Paths of Darkness #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Servant of the Shard (Paths of Darkness #3) \n With each kill, I grow wiser, and with added wisdom, I grow stronger.
