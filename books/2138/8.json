{"id":95372,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"TURNING ADVANTAGE INTO DISASTER Kohrin Soulez held his arm up before him, focusing his thoughts on the black, red-laced gauntlet that he wore on his right hand. Those laces seemed to pulse now, an all-too- familiar feeling for the secretive and secluded man. Someone was trying to look in on him and his fortress at Dallabad Oasis. Soulez forced his concentration deeper into the magical glove. He had recently been approached by a mediator from Calimport inquiring about a possible sale of his beloved sword, Charon\u0027s Claw. Soulez, of course, had balked at the absurd notion. He held this item more dear to his heart than he had any of his numerous wives, even above his many, many children. The offer had been serious, promising wealth beyond imagination for the single item. Soulez had gained enough understanding of Calimport\u0027s guildsmen and had been in possession of Charon\u0027s Claw long enough to know what a serious offer, obviously refused and without room for bargaining, might bring, and so he was not surprised to find that prying eyes were seeking him out now. Since further investigation had whispered that the would-be purchaser might be Artemis Entreri and the Basadoni Guild, Soulez had been watching carefully for those eyes in particular. They would look for weakness but would find none, and thus, he believed, they would merely go away. As Soulez fell deeper into the energies of the gauntlet, he came to recognize a new element, dangerous only because it hinted that the would-be thief this time might not be so easily dissuaded. These were not the magical energies of a wizard he felt, nor the prayers of a divining priest. No, this energy was different than the expected, but certainly nothing beyond the understanding of Soulez and the gauntlet. \"Psionics,\" he said aloud, looking past the gauntlet to his lieutenants, who were standing at attention about his throne room. Three of them were his own children. The fourth was a great military commander from Memnon, and the fifth was a renowned, and now retired, thief from Calimport. Conveniently, Soulez thought, a former member of the Basadoni Guild. \"Artemis Entreri and the Basadonis,\" Soulez told them, \"if it is them, have apparently found access to a psionicist.\" The five lieutenants muttered among themselves about the implications of that. \"Perhaps that has been Artemis Entreri\u0027s edge for all these years,\" the youngest of them, Kohrin Soulez\u0027s daughter, Ahdahnia, remarked. \"Entreri?\" laughed Preelio, the old thief. \"Strong of mind? Certainly. Psionics? Bah! He never needed them, so fine was he with the blade.\" \"But whoever seeks my treasure has access to the mind powers,\" said Soulez. \"They believe that they have found an edge, a weakness of mine and of my treasure\u0027s, that they can exploit. That only makes them more dangerous, of course. We can expect an attack.\" All five of the lieutenants stiffened at that proclamation, but none seemed overly concerned. There was no grand conspiracy against Dallabad among the guilds of Calimport. Kohrin Soulez had paid dearly to certify that information right away. The five knew that no one guild, or even two or three of the guilds banded together, could muster the power to overthrow Dallabad-not while Soulez carried the sword and the gauntlet and could render any wizards all but ineffective. \"No soldiers will break through our walls,\" Ahdahnia remarked with a confident smirk. \"No thieves will slide through the shadows to the inner structures.\" \"Unless through some devilish mind power,\" Preelio put in, looking to the elder Soulez. Kohrin Soulez only laughed. \"They believe they have found a weakness,\" he reiterated. \"I can stop them with this-\" he held up the glove-\"and of course, I have other means.\" He let the thought hang in the air, his smile bringing grins to the faces of all in attendance. There was a sixth lieutenant, after all, one little seen and little bothered, one used primarily as an instrument of interrogation and torture, one who preferred to spend as little time with the humans as possible. \"Secure the physical defenses,\" Soulez instructed them. \"I will see to the powers of the mind.\" He waved them away and sat back, focusing again on his mighty black gauntlet, on the red stitching that ran through it like veins of blood. Yes, he could feel the meager prying, and while he wished that the jealous folk would simply leave him to his business in peace, he believed that he would enjoy this little bit of excitement. He knew that Yharaskrik certainly would. Far below Kohrin Soulez\u0027s throne room, in deep tunnels that few of Soulez\u0027s soldiers even knew existed, Yharaskrik was already well aware that someone or something using psionic energies had breached the oasis. Yharaskrik was a mind flayer, an illithid, a humanoid creature with a bulbous head that resembled a huge brain, with several tentacles protruding from the part of his face where a nose, mouth, and chin should have been. Illithids were horrible to behold, and could be quite formidable physically, but their real powers lay in the realm of the mind, in psionic energies that dwarfed the powers of human practitioners, even of drow practitioners. Illithids could simply overwhelm an opponent with stunning blasts of mental energies, and either enslave the unfortunate victim, his mind held in a fugue state, or move in for a feast, attaching their horrid tentacles to the helpless victim and burrowing in to suck out brain matter. Yharaskrik had been working with Kohrin Soulez for many years. Soulez considered the creature as much an indentured servant as a minion. He believed he had cut a fair deal with the creature after Soulez had apparently rendered Yharaskrik helpless in a short battle, capturing the illithid\u0027s mind blast within the magical netting of his gauntlet and thus leaving Yharaskrik open to a devastating counterstrike with the deadly sword. In truth, had Soulez gone for that strike, Yharaskrik would have melted away into the stone, using energies not directed against Soulez and thus beyond the reach of the gauntlet. Soulez had not pressed the attack, though, as Yharaskrik\u0027s communal brain had calculated. The opportunistic man had struck a deal instead, offering the illithid its life and a comfortable place to do its meditation-or whatever else it was that illithids did-in exchange for certain services whenever they were needed, primarily to aid in the defense of Dallabad Oasis. In all these years, Kohrin Soulez had never once harbored any suspicions that coming to Dallabad in such a capacity had been Yharaskrik\u0027s duty all along, that the illithid had been chosen among its strange kin to seek out and study the black and red gauntlet, as mind flayers were often sent to learn of anything that could so block their devastating energies. In truth, Yharaskrik had learned little of use concerning the gauntlet over the years, but the creature was never anxious about that. Brilliant illithids were among the most patient of all the creatures in the multiverse, savoring the process more than the goal. Yharaskrik was quite content in its tunnel home. Some psionic force had tickled the illithid\u0027s sensibility, and Yharaskrik felt enough of the stream of energy to know that it was no other illithid psionically prying about Dallabad Oasis. The mind flayer, as confident in his superiority as all of his kind, was more intrigued than concerned. He was actually a bit perturbed that the fool Soulez had captured that psychic call with his gauntlet, but now the call had returned, redirected. Yharaskrik had called back, bringing his roving mind eye down, down, to the deep caverns. The illithid did not try to hide its surprise when it discerned the source of that energy, nor did the creature on the other end, a drow, even begin to mask his own stunned reaction. Haszakkin! the drow\u0027s thoughts instinctively screamed, their word for illithid-a word that conveyed a measure of respect the drow rarely gave to any creature that was not drow. Dyon G\u0027ennivalz? Yharaskrik asked, the name of a drow city the illithid had known well in its younger days. Menzoberranzan, came the psionic reply. House Oblodra, the brilliant creature imparted, for that atypical drow house was well known among all the mind flayer communities of Faerun\u0027s Underdark. No more, came Kimmuriel\u0027s response. Yharaskrik sensed anger there, and understood it well as Kimmuriel relayed the memories of the downfall of his arrogant family. There had been, during the Time of Troubles, a period when magic, but not psionics, had ceased to function. In that too-brief time, the leaders of House Oblodra had challenged the greater houses of Menzoberranzan, including mighty Matron Baenre herself. The energies shifted with the shifting of the gods, and psionics had become temporarily impotent, while the powers of conventional magic had returned. Matron Baenre\u0027s response to the threats of House Oblodra had wiped the structure and all of the family- except for Kimmuriel, who had wisely used his ties with Jarlaxle and Bregan D\u0027aerthe to make a hasty retreat-from the city, dropping it into the chasm called the Clawrift. You seek the conquest of Dallabad Oasis? Yharaskrik asked, fully expecting an answer, for creatures communicating through psionics often held their own loyalties to each other even above those of their kindred. Dallabad will be ours before the night has passed, Kimmuriel honestly replied. The connection abruptly ended, and Yharaskrik understood the hasty retreat as Kohrin Soulez sauntered into the dark chamber, his right hand clad in the cursed gauntlet that so interfered with psionic energy. The illithid bowed before his supposed master. \"We have been scouted,\" Soulez said, getting right to the point, his tension obvious as he stood before the horrid mind flayer. \"Mind s eye,\" the illithid agreed in its physical, watery voice. \"I sensed it.\" \"Powerful?\" Soulez asked. Yharaskrik gave a quiet gurgle, the illithid equivalent of a resigned shrug, showing his lack of respect for any psionicist that was not illithid. It was an honest appraisal, even though the psionicist in question was drow and not human, and tied to a drow house that was well known among Yharaskrik\u0027s people. Still, though the mind flayer was not overly concerned about any battle he might see against the drow psionicist, Yharaskrik knew the dark elves well enough to understand that the Oblodran psionicist would likely be the least of Kohrin Soulez\u0027s problems. \"Power is always a relative concept,\" the illithid answered cryptically. Kohrin Soulez felt the tingling of magical energy as he ascended the long spiral staircase that took him back to the ground level of his palace in Dallabad. The guild-master broke into a run, scrambling, muscles working to their limits and his old bones feeling no pain. He thought that the attack must already be underway. He calmed somewhat, slowing and huffing and puffing to catch his breath. He came up into the guild house to find many of his soldiers milling about, talking excitedly, but seeming more curious than terrified. \"Is it yours, Father?\" asked Ahdahnia, her dark eyes gleaming. Kohrin Soulez stared at her curiously, and taking the cue, Ahdahnia led him to an outer room with an east-facing window. There it stood, right in the middle of Dallabad Oasis, within the outer walls of Kohrin Soulez\u0027s fortress. A crystalline tower, gleaming in the bright sunlight, an image of Crenshinibon, the calling card of doom. Kohrin Soulez\u0027s right hand throbbed with tingling energy as he looked at the magical structure. His gauntlet could capture magical energy and even turn it back against the initiator. It had never failed him, but in just looking at this spectacular tower the guildmaster suddenly recognized that he and his toys were puny things indeed. He knew without even going out and trying that he could not hope to drag the magical energies from that tower, that if he tried, it would consume him and his gauntlet. He shuddered as he pictured a physical manifestation of that absorption, an image of Kohrin Soulez frozen as a gargoyle on the top rim of that magnificent tower. \"Is it yours, Father?\" Ahdahnia asked again. The eagerness left her voice and the sparkle left her eyes as Kohrin turned to her, his face bloodless. Outside of Dallabad fortress\u0027s wall, under the shelter of a copse of palm trees and surrounded by globes of magical darkness, Jarlaxle called to the tower. Its outer wall elongated, and sent forth a tendril, a stairway tunnel that breached the darkness globes and reached to the mercenary\u0027s feet. Secure that his soldiers were all in place, Jarlaxle ascended the stairs into the tower proper. With a thought to the Crystal Shard, he retracted the tunnel, effectively sealing himself in. From that high vantage point in the middle of the fortress courtyard, Jarlaxle watched the unfolding drama around him. Could you dim the light? he telepathically asked the tower. Light is strength, Crenshinibon answered. For you, perhaps, the mercenary replied. For me, it is uncomfortable. Jarlaxle felt a sensation akin to a chuckle from the Crystal Shard, but the artifact did comply and thicken its eastern wall, considerably dulling the light in the room. It also provided a floating chair for Jarlaxle, so that he could drift about the perimeter of the room, studying the battle that would soon unfold. Notice that Artemis Entreri will partake of the attack, the Crystal Shard remarked, and it sent the chair floating to the northern side of the room. Jarlaxle took the cue and focused hard down below, outside the fortress wall, to the tents and trees and boulders. Finally, with helpful guidance from the artifact, the drow spotted the figure lurking about the shadows. He did not do so when we planned the attack on Pasha Da\u0027Daclan, Crenshinibon added. Of course, the Crystal Shard knew that Jarlaxle was considering the same thing. The implications continued to follow the line that Entreri had some secret agenda here, some private gain that was either outside of the domain of Bregan D\u0027aerthe, or held some consequence within the second level of the band\u0027s hierarchy. Either way, both Jarlaxle and Crenshinibon thought it more amusing than in any way threatening. The floating chair drifted back across the small circular room, putting Jarlaxle in line with the first diversionary attack, a series of darkness globes at the top of the outer wall. The soldiers there went into a panic, running and crying out to reform a defensive line away from the magic, but even as they moved back-in fairly good order, Jarlaxle noted-the real attack began, bubbling up from the ground within the fortress courtyard. Rai-guy had crossed the courtyard, ten difficult feet at a time, casting a series of passwall spells out of a wand. Now, from a natural tunnel that he had fortunately located below the fortress, the drow wizard enacted the last of those passwalls, vanishing a section of stone and dirt. Immediately the soldiers of Bregan D\u0027aerthe arose, floating with drow levitation into the courtyard, enacting darkness globes above them to confuse their enemies and to lessen the blinding impact of the hated sun. \"We should have attacked at night,\" Jarlaxle said aloud. Daytime is when my power is at its peak, Crenshinibon responded immediately, and Jarlaxle felt the rest of the thought keenly. Crenshinibon was none-too-subtly reminding him that it was more powerful than all of Bregan D\u0027aerthe combined. That expression of confidence was more than a little disconcerting to the mercenary leader, for reasons that he hadn\u0027t yet begun to untangle. Rai-guy stood in the hole, issuing orders to those dark elves running and leaping into levitation, floating up and eager for battle. The wizard was particularly animated this day. His blood was up, as always during a conquest, but he was not pleased at all that Jarlaxle had decided to launch the attack at dawn, a seemingly foolish trade-off of putting his soldiers, used to a world of blackness, at a disadvantage, for the simple gain of constructing a crystalline tower vantage point. The appearance of the tower was an amazing thing, without doubt, one that showed the power of the invaders clearly to those defending inside. Rai-guy did not diminish the value of striking such terror, but every time he saw one of his soldiers squint painfully as he rose up out of the hole into the daylight, the wizard considered his leader\u0027s continuing surprising behavior and gritted his teeth in frustration. Also, the mere fact that they were using dark elves openly against the fortress seemed more than a bit of a gamble. Could they not have accomplished this conquest, as they had planned to do with Pasha Da\u0027Daclan, by striking openly with human, perhaps even kobold soldiers, while the dark elves infiltrated more quietly? What would be left of Dallabad after the conquest now, after all? Almost all remaining alive within-and there would be many, since the dark elves led every assault with their trademark sleep- poisoned hand crossbow darts-would have to be executed anyway, lest they communicate the truth of their conquerors. Rai-guy reminded himself of his place in the guild and knew it would take a monumental error on the part of Jarlaxle, one that cost the lives of many of Bregan D\u0027aerthe, for him to rally enough support truly to overthrow Jarlaxle. Perhaps this would be that mistake. The wizard heard a change in the timbre of the shouts from above. He glanced up, taking note that the sunlight seemed brighter, that the globes of magical darkness had gone away. The magically created shaft, too, suddenly disappeared, capturing a pair of levitating soldiers within it as the stone and dirt rematerialized. It lasted only a moment, as if something suddenly reached out and grabbed away the magic that was trying to dispel Rai-guys vertical passwall dweomers. That moment was long enough to destroy utterly the two unfortunate drow soldiers. The wizard cursed at Jarlaxle, but under his breath. He reminded himself to keep safe and to see, in the end, if this attack, even if a complete failure, might not prove personally beneficial. Kohrin Soulez fell back. His sensibilities were stung, both by the realization that these were dark elves that had come to secluded Dallabad, and by the magical counterattack that had overwhelmed his gauntlet. He had come out from the main house to rally his soldiers, the blood-red blade of Charon\u0027s Claw bared and waving, leaving streaks of ashy blackness in the air. Soulez had run to the area of obvious invasion, where globes of darkness and screams of pain and terror heralded the fighting. Dispelling those globes was no major task for the gauntlet, nor was closing the hole in the ground through which the enemy continued to arrive, but Soulez had nearly been overwhelmed by a wave of energy that countered the countering energy he was exerting himself. It was a blast of magical power so raw and pure that he could not hope to contain it. He knew it had come from the tower. The tower! The dark elves! His doom was at hand! He fell back into the main house, ordering his soldiers to fight to the last. As he ran along the more deserted corridors leading to his private chambers, his dear Ahdahnia right behind him, he called out to Yharaskrik to come and whisk him away. There was no answer. \"He has heard me,\" Soulez assured his daughter anyway. \"We need only escape long enough for Yharaskrik to come to us. Then we will run out to inform the lords of Calimport that the dark elves have come.\" \"The traps and locks along the hallways will keep our enemies at bay,\" Ahdahnia replied. Despite the surprising nature of their enemies, the woman actually believed the claim. These long corridors weaving along the somewhat circular main house of Dallabad were lined with heavy, metal-banded doors of stone and wood layers that could defeat most intrusions, wizardly or physical. Also, the sheer number of traps in place between the outer walls and Kohrin Soulez\u0027s inner sanctuary would deter and daunt the most seasoned of thieves. But not the most clever. Artemis Entreri had worked his way unnoticed to the base of the fortress\u0027s northern wall. It was no small feat- an impossible one under normal circumstances, for there was an open field surrounding the fortress, running nearly a hundred feet to the trees and tents and boulders, and several of the small ponds that marked the place- but this was not a normal circumstance. With a tower materializing inside the fortress, most of the guards were scurrying about, trying to find some answers as to whether it was an invading enemy or some secret project of Kohrin Soulez\u0027s. Even those guards on the walls couldn\u0027t help but stare in awe at that amazing sight. Entreri dug himself in. His borrowed black cloak-a camouflaging drow piwafwi that wouldn\u0027t last long in the sun-offered him some protection should any of the guards lean over the twenty foot wall and look down at him. The assassin waited until the sounds of fighting erupted from within. To untrained eyes, the wall of Kohrin Soulez\u0027s fortress would have seemed a sheer thing indeed, all of polished white marble joints forming an attractive contrast to the brownish sandstone and gray granite. To Entreri, though, it seemed more of a stairway than a wall, with many seam-steps and finger-holds. He was up near the top in a matter of seconds. The assassin lifted himself up just enough to glance over at the two guards anxiously reloading their crossbows. They were looking in the direction of the courtyard where the battle raged. Over the wall without a sound went the piwafwi-cloaked assassin. He came down from the wall only a few moments later, dressed as one of Kohrin Soulez\u0027s guards. Entreri joined in with some others running frantically around to the front courtyard, but he broke away from them as he came in sight of the fighting. He melted back against the wall and toward the open, main door, where he spotted Kohrin Soulez. The guildmaster was battling drow magic and waving that wondrous sword. Entreri kept several steps ahead of the man as he was forced to fall back. The assassin entered the main building before Soulez and his daughter. Entreri ran, silent and unseen, along those corridors, through the open doors, past the unset traps, ahead of the two fleeing nobles and those soldiers trailing their leader to secure the corridor behind him. The assassin reached the main door of Soulez\u0027s private chambers with enough time to spare to recognize that the alarms and traps on this portal were indeed in place and to do something about them. Thus, when Ahdahnia Soulez pushed open that magnificent, gold-leafed door, leading her father into his seemingly secure chamber, Artemis Entreri was already there, standing quietly ready behind a floor-to-ceiling tapestry. The three Dallabad soldiers-well-trained, well-armed, and well-armored with shining chain and small bucklers-faced off against the three dark elves along the western wall of the fortress. The men, frightened as they were, kept the presence of mind to form a triangular defense, using the wall behind them to secure their backs. The dark elves fanned out and came at them in unison. Their amazing drow swords-two for each warrior-worked circular attack routines so quickly that the paired weapons seemed to blur the line between where one sword stopped and the other began. The humans, to their credit, held strong their position, offered parries and blocks wherever necessary, and suppressed any urge to scream out in terror and charge blindly-as some of their nearby comrades were doing to disastrous results. Gradually, talking quickly between them to analyze each of their enemy\u0027s movements, the trio began to decipher the deceptive and brilliant drow sword dance, enough so, at least, to offer one or two counters of their own. Back and forth it went, the humans wisely holding their position, not following any of the individually retreating dark elves and thus weakening their own defenses. Blade rang against blade, and the magical swords Kohrin Soulez had provided his best-trained soldiers matched up well enough against the drow weapons. The dark elves exchanged words the humans did not understand. Then the three drow attacked in unison, all six swords up high in a blurring dance. Human swords and shields came up to meet the challenge and the resulting clang of metal against metal rang out like a single note. That note soon changed, diminished, and all three of the human soldiers came to recognize, but not completely to comprehend, that their attackers had each dropped one sword. Shields and swords up high to meet the continuing challenge, they only understood their exposure below the level of the fight when they heard the clicks of three small crossbows and felt the sting as small darts burrowed into their bellies. The dark elves backed off a step. Tonakin Ta\u0027salz, the central soldier, called out to his companions that he was hit, but that he was all right. The soldier to Tonakin\u0027s left started to say the same, but his words were slurred and groggy. Tonakin glanced over just in time to see him tumble facedown in the dirt. To his right, there came no response at all. Tonakin was alone. He took a deep breath and skittered back against the wall as the three dark elves retrieved their dropped swords. One of them said something to him that he did not understand, but while the words escaped him, the expression on the drow\u0027s face did not. He should have fallen down asleep, the drow was telling him. Tonakin agreed wholeheartedly as the three came in suddenly, six swords slashing in brutal and perfectly coordinated attacks. To his credit, Tonakin Ta\u0027salz actually managed to block two of them. And so it went throughout the courtyard and all along the wall of the fortress. Jarlaxle\u0027s mercenaries, using mostly physical weapons but with more than a little magic thrown in, overwhelmed the soldiers of Dallabad. The mercenary leader had instructed his killers to spare as many as possible, using sleep darts and accepting surrender. He noted, though, that more than a few were not waiting long enough to find out if any opponents who had resisted the sleep poison might offer a surrender. The dark elf leader merely shrugged at that, hardly concerned. This was open battle, the kind that he and his mercenaries didn\u0027t see often enough. If too many of Kohrin Soulez\u0027s soldiers were killed for the oasis fortress to properly function, then Jarlaxle and Crenshinibon would simply find replacements. In any case, with Soulez chased back into his house by the sheer power of the Crystal Shard, the assault had already reached its second stage. It was going along beautifully. The courtyard and wall were already secured, and the house had been breached at several points. Now Kimmuriel and Rai-guy at last came onto the scene. Kimmuriel had several of the captives who were still awake dragged before him, forcing them to lead the way into the house. He would use his overpowering will to read their thoughts as they walked him and the drow through the trapped maze to the prize that was Soulez. Jarlaxle rested back in the crystalline tower. A part of him wanted to go down and join in the fun, but he decided instead to remain and share the moment with his most powerful companion, the Crystal Shard. He even allowed the artifact to thin the eastern wall once more, allowing more sunlight into the room. \"Where is he?\" Kohrin Soulez fumed, stomping about the room. \"Yharaskrik!\" \"Perhaps he cannot get through,\" Ahdahnia reasoned. She moved nearer to the tapestry as she spoke. Entreri knew he could step out and take her down, then go for his prize. He held the urge, intrigued and wary. \"Perhaps the same force from the tower-\" Ahdahnia went on. \"No!\" Kohrin Soulez interrupted. \"Yharaskrik is beyond such things. His people see things-everything- differently.\" Even as he finished, Ahdahnia gasped and skittered back across Entreri\u0027s field of view. Her eyes went wide as she looked back in the direction of her father, who had walked out of Entreri\u0027s very limited line of sight. Confident that the woman was too entranced by whatever it was that she was watching, Entreri slipped down low to one knee and dared peek out around the tapestry. He saw an illithid step out of the psionic dimensional doorway and into the room to stand before Kohrin. A mind flayer! The assassin fell back behind the tapestry, his thoughts whirling. Very few things in all the world could rattle Artemis Entreri, who had survived life on the streets from a tender young age and had risen to the very top of his profession, who had survived Menzoberranzan and many, many encounters with dark elves. One of those few things was a mind flayer. Entreri had seen a few in the dark elf city, and he abhorred them more than any other creature he had ever met. It wasn\u0027t their appearance that so upset the assassin, though they were brutally ugly by any but illithid standards. No, it was their very demeanor, their different view of the world, as Kohrin had just alluded to. Throughout his life, Artemis Entreri had gained the upper hand because he understood his enemies better than they understood him. He had found the dark elves a bit more of a challenge, based on the fact that the drow were too experienced-were simply too good at conspiring and plotting for him to gain any real comprehension... any that he could hold confidence in, at least. With illithids, though he had only dealt with them briefly, the disadvantage was even more fundamental and impossible to overcome. There was no way Artemis Entreri could understand that particular enemy because there was no way he could bring himself to any point where he could view the world as an illithid might. No way. So Entreri tried to make himself very small. He listened to every word, every inflection, every intake of breath, very carefully. \"Why did you not come earlier to my call?\" Kohrin Soulez demanded. \"They are dark elves,\" Yharaskrik responded in that bubbling, watery voice that sounded to Entreri like a very old man with too much phlegm in his throat. \"They are within the building.\" \"You should have come earlier!\" Ahdahnia cried. \"We could have beaten-\" Her voice left her with a gasp. She stumbled backward and seemed about to fall. Entreri knew the mind flayer had just hit her with some scrambling burst of mental energy. \"What do I do?\" Kohrin Soulez wailed. \"There is nothing you can do,\" answered Yharaskrik. \"You cannot hope to survive.\" \"P-par-parlay with them, F-father!\" cried the recovering Ahdahnia. \"Give them what they want-else you cannot hope to survive.\" \"They will take what they want,\" Yharaskrik assured her, and turned back to Kohrin Soulez. \"You have nothing to offer. There is no hope.\" \"Father?\" Ahdahnia asked, her voice suddenly weak, almost pitiful. \"You attack them!\" Kohrin Soulez demanded, holding his deadly sword out toward the illithid. \"Overwhelm them!\" Yharaskrik made a sound that Entreri, who had mustered enough willpower to peek back around the tapestry, recognized to be an expression of mirth. It wasn\u0027t a laugh, actually, but more like a clear, gasping cough. Kohrin Soulez, too, apparently understood the meaning of the reply, for his face grew very red. \"They are drow. Do you now understand that?\" the illithid asked. \"There is no hope.\" Kohrin Soulez started to respond, to demand again that Yharaskrik take the offensive, but as if he had suddenly come to figure it all out, he paused and stared at his octopus-headed companion. \"You knew,\" he accused. \"When the psionicist entered Dallabad, he conveyed...\" \"The psionicist was drow,\" the illithid confirmed. \"Traitor!\" Kohrin Soulez cried. \"There is no betrayal. There was never friendship, or even alliance,\" the illithid remarked logically. \"But you knew!\" Yharaskrik didn\u0027t bother to reply. \"Father?\" Ahdahnia asked again, and she was trembling visibly. Kohrin Soulez\u0027s breath came in labored gasps. He brought his left hand up to his face and wiped away sweat and tears. \"What am I to do?\" he asked, speaking to himself. \"What will...\" Yharaskrik began that coughing laughter again, and this time, it sounded clearly to Entreri that the creature was mocking pitiful Soulez. Kohrin Soulez composed himself suddenly and glared at the creature. \"This amuses you?\" he asked. \"I take pleasure in the ironies of the lesser species,\" Yharaskrik responded. \"How much your whines sound as those of the many you have killed. How many have begged for their lives futilely before Kohrin Soulez, as he will now futilely beg for his at the feet of a greater adversary than he can possibly comprehend?\" \"But an adversary that you know well!\" Kohrin cried. \"I prefer the drow to your pitiful kind,\" Yharaskrik freely admitted. \"They never beg for mercy that they know will not come. Unlike humans, they accept the failings of individual-minded creatures. There is no greater joining among them, as there is none among you, but they understand and accept that fallibility.\" The illithid gave a slight bow. \"That is all the respect I now offer to you, in the hour of your death,\" Yharaskrik explained. \"I would throw energy your way, that you might capture it and redirect it against the dark elves- and they are close now, I assure you-but I choose not to.\" Artemis Entreri recognized clearly the change that came over Kohrin Soulez then, the shift from despair to nothing- to-lose anger that he had seen so many times during his decades on the tough streets. \"But I wear the gauntlet!\" Kohrin Soulez said powerfully, and he moved the magnificent sword out toward Yharaskrik. \"I will at least get the pleasure of first witnessing your end!\" But even as he made the declaration, Yharaskrik seemed to melt into the stone at his feet and was gone. \"Damn him!\" Kohrin Soulez screamed. \"Damn you-\" His tirade cut short as a pounding came on the door. \"Your wand!\" the guildmaster cried to his daughter, turning to face her, in the direction of the floor-to- ceiling tapestry that decorated his private chamber. Ahdahnia just stood there, wide-eyed, making no move to reach for the wand at her belt. Her expression changing not at all, she crumpled to the floor. There stood Artemis Entreri. Kohrin Soulez\u0027s eyes widened as he watched her descent, but as if he hardly cared for the fall of Ahdahnia other than its implications for his own safety, his gaze focused clearly on Entreri. \"It would have been so much easier if you had merely sold the blade to me,\" the assassin remarked. \"I knew this was your doing, Entreri,\" Soulez growled back at him, advancing a step, the blood-red blade gleaming at the ready. \"I offer you one more chance to sell it,\" Entreri said, and Soulez stopped short, his expression one of pure incredulity. \"For the price of her life,\" the assassin added, pointing down at Ahdahnia with his jeweled dagger. \"Your own life is yours to bargain for, but you\u0027ll have to make that bargain with others.\" Another bang sounded out in the corridor, followed by the sounds of some fighting. \"They are close, Kohrin Soulez,\" Entreri remarked, \"close and overwhelming.\" \"You brought dark elves to Calimport,\" Soulez growled back at him. \"They came of their own accord,\" Entreri replied. \"I was merely wise enough not to try to oppose them. So I make my offer, but only this one last time. I can save Ahdahnia- she is not dead but merely asleep.\" To accentuate his point, he held up a small crossbow quarrel of unusual design, a drow bolt that had been tipped with sleeping poison. \"Give me the sword and gauntlet-now-and she lives. Then you can bargain for your own life. The sword will do you little good against the dark elves, for they need no magic to destroy you.\" \"But if I am to bargain for my life, then why not do so with the sword in hand?\" Kohrin Soulez asked. In response, Entreri glanced down at the sleeping form of Ahdahnia. \"I am to trust that you will keep your word?\" Soulez answered. Entreri didn\u0027t answer, other than to fix the man with a cold stare. There came a sharp rap on the heavy door. As if incited by that sound of imminent danger, Kohrin Soulez leaped forward, slashing hard. Entreri could have killed Ahdahnia and still dodged, but he did not. He slipped back behind the tapestry and went down low, scrambling along its length. He heard the tearing behind him as Soulez slashed and stabbed. Charon\u0027s Claw easily sliced the heavy material, even took chunks out of the wall behind it. Entreri came out the other side to find Soulez already moving in his direction, the man wearing an expression that seemed half crazed, even jubilant. \"How valuable will the drow elves view me when they enter to find Artemis Entreri dead?\" he squealed, and he launched a thrust, feint and slash for the assassin\u0027s shoulder. Entreri had his own sword out then, in his right hand, his dagger still in his left, and he snapped it up, driving the slash aside. Soulez was good, very good, and he had the formidable weapon back in close defensively before the assassin could begin to advance with his dagger. Respect kept Artemis Entreri back from the man, and more importantly, from that devastating weapon. He knew enough about Charon\u0027s Claw to understand that a simple nick from it, even one on his hand that he might suffer in a successful parry, would fester and grow and would likely kill him. Confidant that he\u0027d find the right opening, the deadly assassin stalked the man slowly, slowly. Soulez attacked again with a low thrust that Entreri hopped back from, and a thrust high that the assassin ducked. Entreri slapped at the red blade with his sword and thrust at his opponent\u0027s center mass. It was a brilliantly quick routine that would have left almost any opponent at least shallowly stabbed. He never got near to hitting Entreri. Then he had to scramble and throw out a cut to the side to keep the assassin, who had somehow quick-stepped to his right while slapping hard at the third thrust, at bay. Kohrin Soulez growled in frustration as they came up square again, facing each other from a distance of about ten feet, with Entreri continuing that composed stalk. Now Soulez also moved, angling to intercept. He was dragging his back foot behind him, Entreri noted, keeping ready to change direction, trying to cut off the room and any possible escape routes. \"You so desperately desire Charon\u0027s Claw,\" Soulez said with a chuckle, \"but do you even begin to understand the true beauty of the weapon? Can you even guess at its power and its tricks, assassin?\" Entreri continued to back and pace-back to the left, then back to the right-allowing Soulez to shrink down the battlefield. The assassin was growing impatient, and also, the sounds on the door indicated that the resistance in the hallway had come to an end. The door was magnificent and strong, but it would not hold out long, and Entreri wanted this finished before Rai-guy and the dark elves arrived. \"You think I am an old man,\" Soulez remarked, and he came forward in a short rush, thrusting. Entreri picked it off and this time came forward with a counter of his own, rolling his sword under Soulez\u0027s blade and sliding it out. The assassin turned and stepped ahead, dagger rushing forward, but he had to disengage from the powerful sword too soon. The angle of the parry was forcing the enchanted blade dangerously close to Entreri\u0027s exposed hand, and without the block, he had to skitter into a quick retreat as Soulez slashed across. \"I am an old man,\" Soulez continued, sounding undaunted, \"but I draw strength from the sword. I am your fighting equal, Artemis Entreri, and with this sword you are surely doomed.\" He came on again, but Entreri retreated easily, sliding back toward the wall opposite the door. He knew he was running out of room, but to him that only meant that Kohrin Soulez was running out of room, too, and out of time. \"Ah, yes, run back, little rabbit,\" Soulez taunted. \"I know you, Artemis Entreri. I know you. Behold!\" As he finished, he began waving the sword before him, and Entreri had to blink, for the blade began trailing blackness. No, not trailing, the assassin realized to his surprise, but emitting blackness. It was thick ash that held in place in the air in great sweeping opaque fans, altering the \u0027battlefield to Kohrin Soulez\u0027s designs. \"I know you!\" Soulez cried and came forward, sweeping, sweeping more ash screens into the air. \"Yes, you know me,\" Entreri answered calmly, and Soulez slowed. The timbre of Entreri\u0027s voice had reminded him of the power of this particular opponent. \"You see me at night, Kohrin Soulez, in your dreams. When you look into the darkest shadows of those nightmares, do you see those eyes looking back at you?\" As he finished, he came forward a step, tossing his sword slightly into the air before him, and at just the right angle so that the approaching sword was the only thing Kohrin Soulez could see. The room\u0027s door exploded into a thousand tiny little pieces. Soulez hardly noticed, coming forward to meet the attack, slapping the apparently thrusting sword on top, then below and to the side. So beautifully angled was Entreri\u0027s toss that the man\u0027s own quick parry strikes, one countering the spin of the other, gave Soulez the illusion that Entreri was still holding the other end of the blade. He leaped ahead, through the opaque fans of the sword\u0027s conjured ash, and struck hard for where he knew the assassin had to be. Soulez stiffened, feeling the sting in his back. Entreri\u0027s dagger cut into his flesh. \"Do you see those eyes looking back at you from the shadows of your nightmares, Kohrin Soulez?\" Entreri asked again. \"Those are my eyes.\" Soulez felt the dagger pulling at his life-force. Entreri hadn\u0027t driven it home yet, but he didn\u0027t have to. The man was beaten, and he knew it. Soulez dropped Charon\u0027s Claw to the floor and let his arm slip down to his side. \"You are a devil,\" he growled at the assassin. \"I?\" Entreri answered innocently. \"Was it not Kohrin Soulez who would have sacrificed his daughter for the sake of a mere weapon?\" As he finished, he was fast to reach down with his free hand and yank the black gauntlet from Soulez\u0027s right hand. To Soulez\u0027s surprise, the glove fell to the floor right beside the sword. From the open doorway across the room came the sound of a voice, melodic yet sharp, and speaking in a language that rolled but was oft-broken with harsh and sharp consonant sounds. Entreri backed away from the man. Soulez turned around to see the ash lines drifting down to the floor, showing him several dark elves standing in the room. Kohrin Soulez took a deep, steadying breath. He had dealt with worse than drow, he silently reminded himself. He had parlayed with an illithid and had survived meetings with the most notorious guildmasters of Calimport. Soulez focused on Entreri then, seeing the man engaged in conversation with the apparent leader of the dark elves, seeing the man drifting farther and farther from him. There, right beside him, lay his precious sword, his greatest possession-an artifact he would indeed protect even at the cost of his own daughter\u0027s life. Entreri moved a bit farther from him. None of the drow were advancing or seemed to pay Soulez any heed at all. Charon\u0027s Claw, so conveniently close, seemed to be calling to him. Gathering all his energy, tensing his muscles and calculating the most fluid course open to him, Kohrin Soulez dived down low, scooped the black, red-stitched gauntlet onto his right hand, and before he could even register that it didn\u0027t seem to fit him the same way, scooped up the powerful, enchanted sword. He turned toward Entreri with a growl. \"Tell them that I will speak with their leader...\" he started to say, but his words quickly became a jumble, his tone going low and his pace slowing, as if something was pulling at his vocal chords. Kohrin Soulez\u0027s face contorted weirdly, his features seeming to elongate in the direction of the sword. All conversation in the room stopped. All eyes turned to stare incredulously at Soulez. \"T-to the Nine... Nine Hells with y-you, Entreri!\" the man stammered, each word punctuated by a croaking groan. \"What is he doing?\" Rai-guy demanded of Entreri. The assassin didn\u0027t answer, just watched in amusement as Kohrin Soulez continued to struggle against the power of Charon\u0027s Claw. His face elongated again and wisps of smoke began wafting up from his body. He tried to cry out, but only an indecipherable gurgle came forth. The smoke increased, and Soulez began to tremble violently, all the while trying to scream out. Nothing more than smoke poured from his mouth. It all seemed to stop then, and Soulez stood staring at Entreri and gasping. The man lived just long enough to put on the most horrified and stunned expression Artemis Entreri had ever seen. It was an expression that pleased Entreri greatly. There was something too familiar in the way in which Soulez had abandoned his daughter. Kohrin Soulez erupted in a sudden, sizzling burst. The skin burned off his head, leaving no more than a whitened skull and wide, horrified eyes. Charon\u0027s Claw hit the hard floor again, making more of a dull thump than any metallic ring. The skull-headed corpse of Kohrin Soulez crumpled in place. \"Explain,\" Rai-guy demanded. Entreri walked over and, wearing a gauntlet that appeared identical to the one Kohrin Soulez had but not a match for the other since it was shaped for the same hand, reached down and calmly gathered up his newest prize. \"Pray I do not go to the Nine Hells, as you surely will, Kohrin Soulez,\" the deadly assassin said to the corpse. \"For if I see you there, I will continue to torment you throughout eternity.\" \"Explain!\" Rai-guy demanded more forcefully. \"Explain?\" Entreri echoed, turning to face the angry drow wizard. He gave a shrug, as if the answer seemed obvious. \"I was prepared, and he was a fool.\" Rai-guy glared at him ominously, and Entreri only smiled back, hoping his amused expression would tempt the wizard to action. He held Charon\u0027s Claw now, and he wore the gauntlet that could catch and redirect magic. The world had just changed in ways that the wretched Rai-guy couldn\u0027t begin to understand.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/servant-of-the-shard-paths-of-darkness-3/page-8.html","bookId":2138,"book":{"id":2138,"title":"Servant of the Shard (Paths of Darkness #3)","description":"Storyline: Servant of the Shard (Paths of Darkness #3) With each kill, I grow wiser, and with added wisdom, I grow stronger.
