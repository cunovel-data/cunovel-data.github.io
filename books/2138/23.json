It curled catlike, its long tail running up past its head, its huge, scaly back rising like a giant wave and sinking in a great exhalation that sent plumes of gray smoke from its nostrils and injected a vibrating rumble throughout the stone of the cavern floor. There was no light in the rocky chamber, save the glow of the dragon itself, a reddish-gold hue-a hot light, as if the beast were too full of energy and savage fires to hold it all in with mere scales.\\n\\n On the other end of the scrying mirror, the six unlikely companions-Cadderly, Danica, Ivan, Pikel, Entreri, and Jarlaxle-watched the dragon with a mixture of awe and dread.\\n\\n \"We could use Shayleigh and her archers,\" Danica remarked, but of course, that was not possible, since the elves had absolutely refused to work alongside the dark elf for any purpose whatsoever and had returned to their forest home in Shilmista.\\n\\n \"We could use King Elbereth\u0027s entire army,\" Cadderly added.\\n\\n \"Ooo,\" said Pikel, who seemed truly mesmerized by the beast, a great wyrm at least as large and horrific as old Fyrentennimar.\\n\\n \"There is the dragon,\" Cadderly said, turning to Entreri. \"Are you certain you still wish to accompany me?\" His question ended weakly, though, given the eager glow in Artemis Entreri\u0027s eyes.\\n\\n The assassin reached into his pouch and brought forth the Crystal Shard.\\n\\n \"Witness your doom,\" he whispered to the artifact. He felt the shard reaching out desperately and powerfully- Cadderly felt those sensations as well. It called to Jarlaxle first, and indeed, the opportunistic drow did begin physically to reach for it, but he resisted.\\n\\n \"Put it away,\" Danica whispered harshly, looking from the green-glowing shard to the shifting beast. \"It will awaken the dragon!\"\\n\\n \"My dear, do you expect to coax the fiery breath from a dragon that remains asleep?\" Jarlaxle reminded her, but Danica turned an angry glare at him.\\n\\n Entreri, hearing the Crystal Shard\u0027s call clearly and recognizing its attempt, understood that the woman spoke wisely, though, for while they would indeed have to wake the beast, they would be far better served if it did not know why. The assassin looked at the artifact and gave a confident, cocky grin, and dropped it back into his pouch and nodded for Cadderly to disenchant the scrying mirror. \"When do we go?\" the assassin asked Cadderly, and his tone made it perfectly clear that he wasn\u0027t shaken in the least by the sight of the monstrous dragon, made it clear that he was eager to be done with the destruction of the vile artifact.\\n\\n \"I have to prepare the proper spells,\" Cadderly replied. \"It will not be long.\"\\n\\n The priest motioned for Danica and his other friends to escort their two undesirable companions away then, though he only dropped the image from the scrying mirror temporarily. As soon as he was alone, he called up the dragon cave again, after placing another spell upon himself that allowed him to see in the dark. He sent the roving eye of the scrying mirror all around the large, intricate lair.\\n\\n There were many great cracks in the floor, he noted, and when he followed one down, he came to recognize that a maze of tunnels and chambers lay beneath the sleeping wyrm. Furthermore, Cadderly wasn\u0027t convinced that the dragon\u0027s cave was very secure structurally. Not at all.\\n\\n He\u0027d have to keep that well in mind while choosing the spells he would bring with him to the home of this great beast known as Hephaestus.\\n\\n Rai-guy, deep in concentration, his eyes closed, allowed the calls of Crenshinibon to invade his thoughts fully. He caught only flashes of anger and despair, the pleas for help, the promises of ultimate glory.\\n\\n He saw some other images, as well, particularly one of a great curled red dragon, and he heard a word, a name echoing in his head: Hephaestus.\\n\\n Rai-guy knew he had to act quickly. He settled back in his private chamber beneath House Basadoni and prayed with all his heart to his Lady Lolth, telling her of the Crystal Shard, and of the glorious chaos the artifact might allow him to bring to the world.\\n\\n For hours, Rai-guy stayed alone, praying, sending away any who knocked at his door-Berg\u0027inyon and Kimmuriel among them-with a gruff and definitive retort.\\n\\n Then, when he believed he\u0027d caught the attention of his dark Spider Queen, or at least the ear of one of her minions, the wizard fell into powerful spellcasting, opening an extra-planar gate.\\n\\n As always with such a spell, Rai-guy had to take care that no unwanted or overly powerful planar denizens walked through that gate. His suspicions were correct, though, and indeed, the creature that came through the portal was one of the yochlol. These were the handmaidens of Lolth, beasts that more resembled half-melted candles with longer appendages than the Spider Queen herself.\\n\\n Rai-guy held his breath, wondering suddenly and fearfully if he had erred in letting on about the artifact. Might Lolth desire the artifact herself and instruct Rai-guy to deliver it to her?\\n\\n \"You have called for help from the Lady,\" the yochlol said, its voice watery and guttural all at once, a dual- toned and horrible sound.\\n\\n \"I wish to return to Menzoberranzan,\" Rai-guy admitted, \"and yet I cannot at this time. An instrument of chaos is about to be destroyed....\"\\n\\n \"Lady Lolth knows of the artifact, Crenshinibon, Rai-guy of House Teyachumet,\" the yochlol replied, and the title the creature bestowed upon him surprised the drow wizard-cleric.\\n\\n He had indeed been a son of House Teyachumet-but that house of Ched Nasad had been obliterated more than a century before. A subtle reminder, the drow realized, that the memory of Lolth and her minions was long indeed.\\n\\n And a warning, perhaps, that he should take great care about how he planned to put the mighty artifact to use in the city of Lolth\u0027s greatest priestesses.\\n\\n Rai-guy saw his dreams of domination over Menzober- ranzan melt then and there.\\n\\n \"Where will you retrieve this item?\" the handmaiden asked.\\n\\n Rai-guy stammered a reply, his thoughts elsewhere for the moment. \"Hephaestus\u0027s lair... a red dragon,\" he said. \"I know not where...\"\\n\\n \"Your answer will be given,\" the handmaiden promised.\\n\\n It turned around and walked through Rai-guy\u0027s gate, and the portal closed immediately, though the drow wizard had done nothing to dispel it.\\n\\n Had Lolth herself been watching the exchange? Rai-guy had to wonder and to fear. Again he understood the futility of his dreams of conquest over Menzoberranzan. The Crystal Shard was powerful indeed, perhaps powerful enough for Rai- guy to manipulate or otherwise unseat enough of the Matron Mothers for him to achieve a position of tremendous power, but something about the way the yochlol had spoken his full name told him he should be careful indeed. Lady Lolth would not permit such a change in the balance of Menzoberranzan\u0027s power structure.\\n\\n For just a brief moment, Rai-guy considered abandoning his quest to retrieve the Crystal Shard, considered taking his remaining allies and his gains and retreating to Menzoberranzan as the coleader, along with his friend, Kimmuriel, of Bregan D\u0027aerthe.\\n\\n A brief moment it was, for the call of the Crystal Shard came rushing back to him then, whispering its promises of power and glory, showing Rai-guy that the surface was not so forbidding a place as he believed. With Crenshinibon, the dark elf could carry on Jarlaxle\u0027s designs, but in more appropriate regions-a mountainous area teeming with goblins, perhaps-and build a magnificent and undyingly loyal legion of minions, of slaves.\\n\\n The drow wizard rubbed his slender black fingers together, waiting anxiously for the answer the yochlol had promised him.\\n\\n \"You cannot deny the beauty,\" Jarlaxle remarked, he and Entreri again sitting outside of the cathedral, relaxing before their journey. Both were well aware that many wary gazes were focused upon them from many vantage points.\\n\\n \"Its very purpose denies that beauty,\" Entreri replied, his tone showing that he had little desire to replay this conversation yet again.\\n\\n Jarlaxle studied the man closely, as if hoping that physical scrutiny alone would unlock this apparently dark episode in Artemis Entreri\u0027s past. The drow wasn\u0027t surprised by Entreri\u0027s dislike of \"hypocritical\" priests. In many ways, Jarlaxle agreed with him. The dark elf had been alive for a long, long time, and had often ventured out of Menzoberranzan-and had known the movements of practically every visitor to that dark city-and he had seen enough of the many varied religious sects of Toril to understand the hypocritical nature of many so-called priests. There was something far deeper than that looming here within Artemis Entreri, though, something visceral.\\n\\n It had to be an event in Entreri\u0027s past, a deeply disturbing episode involving a priest. Perhaps he had been wrongly accused of some crime and tortured by a priest, who often served as jailers for the smaller communities of the surface. Perhaps he had known love once, and that woman had been stolen from him or had been murdered by a priest.\\n\\n Whatever it was, Jarlaxle could clearly see the hatred in Entreri\u0027s dark eyes as the man looked upon the magnificent-and it was magnificent, by any standards- Spirit Soaring. Even for Jarlaxle, a creature of the Under-dark, the place lived up to its name, for when he gazed upon those soaring towers, his very soul was lifted, his spirit enlightened and elevated.\\n\\n Not so for his companion, obviously, and yet another mystery of Artemis Entreri for Jarlaxle to unravel. He did indeed find this man interesting.\\n\\n \"Where will you go after the artifact is destroyed?\" Entreri asked unexpectedly.\\n\\n Jarlaxle had to pause, both fully to digest the question and to consider his answer-for in truth, he really had no answer. \"If we destroy it, you mean,\" he corrected. \"Have you ever dealt with the likes of a red dragon, my friend?\"\\n\\n \"Cadderly has, as I\u0027m sure have you,\" Entreri replied.\\n\\n \"Only once, and I truly have little desire ever to speak with such a beast again,\" Jarlaxle said. \"One cannot reason with a red dragon beyond a certain level, because they are not creatures with any definitive goals for personal gain. They see, they destroy, and take what is left over. A simple existence, really, and one that makes them all the more dangerous.\"\\n\\n \"Then let it see the Crystal Shard and destroy it,\" Entreri remarked, and he felt a twinge then as Crenshini-bon cried out.\\n\\n \"Why?\" Jarlaxle asked suddenly, and Entreri recognized that his ever-opportunistic friend had heard that silent call.\\n\\n \"Why?\" the assassin echoed, turning to regard Jarlaxle fully.\\n\\n \"Perhaps we are being premature in our planning,\" Jarlaxle explained. \"We know how to destroy the Crystal\\n\\n Shard now-likely that will be enough for us to use against the artifact to bend it continually to our will.\"\\n\\n Entreri started to laugh.\\n\\n \"There is truth in what I say, and a gain to be had in following my reasoning,\" Jarlaxle insisted. \"Crenshinibon began to manipulate me, no doubt, but now that we have determined that you, and not the artifact, are truly the master of your relationship, why must we rush ahead to destroy it? Why not determine first if you might control the item enough for our own gain?\"\\n\\n \"Because if you know, beyond doubt, that you can destroy it, and the Crystal Shard knows that, as well, there may well be no need to destroy it,\" Entreri played along.\\n\\n \"Exactly!\" said the now-excited dark elf.\\n\\n \"Because if you know you can destroy the crystalline tower, then there is no possible way that you will wind up with two crystalline towers,\" Entreri replied sarcastically, and the eager grin disappeared from Jarlaxle\u0027s black-skinned face in the blink of an astonished eye.\\n\\n \"It did it again,\" the drow remarked dryly.\\n\\n \"Same bait on the hook, and the Jarlaxle fish chomps even harder,\" Entreri replied.\\n\\n \"The cathedral is beautiful, I say,\" Jarlaxle remarked, looking away and pointedly changing the subject.\\n\\n Entreri laughed again.\\n\\n Delay him, then, Yharaskrik imparted to Kimmuriel when the drow told the illithid the plan to intercept Jarlaxle, Entreri, and the priest Cadderly and his friends at the lair of Hephaestus the red dragon.\\n\\n Rai-guy will not be deterred in any way short of open battle, Kimmuriel explained. He will have the Crystal Shard at all costs.\\n\\n Because the Crystal Shard so instructs him, Yharaskrik replied.\\n\\n Yet it seems as if he has freed himself, partially at least, from its grasp, Kimmuriel argued. He dismissed many of the drow soldiers back to our warren in Menzoberranzan and has systematically relinquished our holdings here on the surface.\\n\\n True enough, the illithid admitted, but you are fooling yourself if you believe that the Crystal Shard will allow Rai-guy to take it to the lightless depths of the Underdark. It is a relic that derives its power from the light of the sun.\\n\\n Rai-guy believes that a few crystalline towers on the surface will allow the artifact to channel that sunlight power back to Menzoberranzan, Kimmuriel explained, for indeed, the drow wizard had told him of that very possibility-a possibility that Crenshinibon itself had imparted to Rai-guy.\\n\\n Rai-guy has come to see many possibilities, Yha- raskrik\u0027s thoughts imparted, and there was a measure of doubt, translated into sarcasm, in the illithid\u0027s response. The source of those varied and marvelous possibilities is always the same.\\n\\n It was a point on which Kimmuriel Oblodra, who now found himself caught in the middle of five dangerous adversaries- Rai-guy, Yharaskrik, Jarlaxle, Artemis Entreri, and the Crystal Shard itself-did not wish to dwell. There was little he could do to alter the approaching events. He would not go against Rai-guy, out of respect for the wizard-cleric\u0027s prowess and intelligence, and also because of his deep relationship with the drow. Of his potential enemies, Kimmuriel feared Yharaskrik least of all. With Rai-guy at his side, he knew the illithid could not win. Kimmuriel could neutralize Yharaskrik\u0027s mental weaponry long enough for Rai-guy to obliterate the creature.\\n\\n While he held respect for the manipulative powers of the Crystal Shard and knew that the mighty artifact would not be pleased with any psionicist, Kimmuriel was honestly beginning to believe that the artifact was indeed a fine match for Rai-guy, a joining that would be of mutual benefit. Jarlaxle hadn\u0027t been able to control the artifact, but Jarlaxle had not been properly forewarned about its manipulative powers. Kimmuriel doubted that Rai-guy would make that same mistake.\\n\\n Still, the psionicist believed that all would be simpler and cleaner if the Crystal Shard were indeed destroyed, but he wasn\u0027t about to go against Rai-guy to ensure that event.\\n\\n He looked at the illithid and realized that he already had gone against his friend, to some extent, merely by informing this bulbous-headed creature, who was certainly an enemy of Rai-guy, that Rai-guy meant to enter an alliance with the Crystal Shard.\\n\\n Kimmuriel bowed to Yharaskrik out of respect, and floated away on psionic winds, back to House Basadoni and his private chambers. Not far down the hall, he knew, Rai- guy was awaiting his answer from the yochlol and plotting his strike against Jarlaxle and the fallen leader\u0027s newfound companions.\\n\\n Kimmuriel had no idea where he was going to fit into all of this. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/servant-of-the-shard-paths-of-darkness-3/page-23.html","bookId":2138,"book":{"id":2138,"title":"Servant of the Shard (Paths of Darkness #3)","description":"Storyline: Servant of the Shard (Paths of Darkness #3) \\n With each kill, I grow wiser, and with added wisdom, I grow stronger.
