{"id":95380,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"DEAR DWAHVEL\\n\\n \"Ah, my friend, how you have deceived me,\" Jarlaxle whispered to Entreri, whose wounds had far from healed, leaving him in a weakened, almost helpless state. As Entreri had floated into semiconsciousness, Jarlaxle, possessed of the magic to heal him fully, had instead taken the time to consider all that had happened. He was in the process of trying to figure out if Entreri had saved him or damned him when he heard an ail-too familiar call.\\n\\n Jarlaxle\u0027s gaze fell over Entreri and a great smile widened on his black-skinned face. Crenshinibon! The man had Crenshinibon! Jarlaxle replayed the events in his mind and quickly figured that Entreri had done more than simply cut the pouch loose from Jarlaxle\u0027s belt in that first, unexpected attack. No, the clever-so clever! - human had switched Jarlaxle\u0027s pouch for an imitation pouch, complete with an imitation Crystal Shard.\\n\\n \"My sneaky companion,\" the mercenary remarked, though he wasn\u0027t sure if Entreri could hear him or not. \"It is good to know that once again, I have not underestimated you!\" As he finished, the mercenary leader went for Entreri\u0027s belt pouch, smiling all the while.\\n\\n The assassin\u0027s hand snapped up and grabbed Jarlaxle by the arm.\\n\\n Jarlaxle had a dagger in his free hand in the blink of an eye, prepared to stab it through the nearly helpless man\u0027s heart, but he noted that Entreri wasn\u0027t pressing the attack any further. The assassin wasn\u0027t reaching for his dagger or any other weapon, but rather, was staring at Jarlaxle plaintively. In his head, Jarlaxle could hear the Crystal Shard calling to him, beckoning him to finish this man off and take back the artifact that was rightfully his.\\n\\n He almost did it, despite the fact that Crenshinibon\u0027s call wasn\u0027t nearly as powerful and melodious as it had been when he had been in possession of the artifact.\\n\\n \"Do not,\" Entreri whispered to him. \"You cannot control it.\"\\n\\n Jarlaxle pulled back, staring hard at the man. \"But you can?\"\\n\\n \"That is why it is calling to you,\" Entreri replied, his breath even more labored than it had been earlier, and blood flowing again from the wound in his side. \"The Crystal Shard has no hold over me.\"\\n\\n \"And why is that?\" Jarlaxle asked doubtfully. \"Has Artemis Entreri taken up the moral code of Drizzt Do\u0027Urden?\"\\n\\n Entreri started to chuckle, but grimaced instead, the pain nearly unbearable. \"Drizzt and I are not so different in many ways,\" he explained. \"In discipline, at least.\"\\n\\n \"And discipline alone will keep the Crystal Shard from controlling you?\" Jarlaxle asked, his tone still one of abject disbelief. \"So, you are saying that I am not as disciplined as either of-\"\\n\\n \"No!\" Entreri growled, and he nearly came up to a sitting position as he tightened his side against a wave of pain.\\n\\n \"No,\" he said more calmly a moment later, easing back and breathing hard. \"Drizzt\u0027s code denied the artifact, as does my own-not a code of morality, but one of independence.\"\\n\\n Jarlaxle fell back a bit, his expression going from doubtful to curious. \"Why did you take it?\"\\n\\n Entreri looked at him and started to respond but wound up just grimacing. Jarlaxle reached under the folds of his cloak and produced a small orb, which he held out to Entreri as he began to chant.\\n\\n The assassin felt better almost immediately, felt his wound closing and his breathing easier to control. Jarlaxle chanted for a few seconds, each one making Entreri feel that much better, but long before the healing had been completely facilitated, the mercenary stopped.\\n\\n \"Answer my question,\" he demanded.\\n\\n \"They were coming to kill you,\" Entreri replied.\\n\\n \"Obviously,\" said Jarlaxle. \"Could you not have merely warned me?\"\\n\\n \"It would not have been enough,\" Entreri insisted. \"There were too many against you, and they knew that your primary weapon would be the artifact. Thus, they neutralized it, temporarily.\"\\n\\n Jarlaxle\u0027s first instinct was to demand the Crystal Shard again, that he could go back and repay Rai-guy and Kimmuriel for their treachery. He held the thought, though, and let Entreri go on.\\n\\n \"They were right in wanting to take it from you,\" the assassin finished boldly.\\n\\n Jarlaxle glared at him but just for a moment.\\n\\n \"Step back from it,\" Entreri advised. \"Shut out its call and consider the actions of Jarlaxle over the last few ten- days. You could not remain on the surface unless your true identity remained secret, yet you brought forth crystalline towers! Bregan D\u0027aerthe, for all of its power, and with all of the power of Crenshinibon behind it, could not rule the world-not even the city of Calimport-yet look at what you tried to do.\"\\n\\n Jarlaxle started to respond several times, but each of his arguments died in his throat before he could begin to offer them. The assassin was right, he knew. He had erred, and badly.\\n\\n \"We cannot go back and try to explain this to the usurpers,\" the mercenary remarked.\\n\\n Entreri shook his head. \"It was the Crystal Shard that inspired the coup against you,\" he explained, and Jarlaxle fell back as if slapped. \"You were too cunning, but Crenshinibon figured that ambitious Rai-guy would easily fall to its chaotic plans.\"\\n\\n \"You say that to placate me,\" Jarlaxle accused.\\n\\n \"I say that because it is the truth, nothing more,\" Entreri replied. Then he had to pause and grimace as a spasm of pain came over him. \"And, if you take the time to consider it, you know that it is. Crenshinibon kept you moving in its preferred direction but not without interference.\"\\n\\n \"The Crystal Shard did not control me, or it did. You cannot have it both ways.\"\\n\\n \"It did manipulate you. How can you doubt that?\" Entreri replied. \"But not to the level that it knew it could manipulate Rai-guy.\"\\n\\n \"I went to Dallabad to destroy the crystal tower, something the artifact surely did not desire,\" Jarlaxle argued, \"and yet, I could have done it! All interference from the shard was denied.\"\\n\\n He continued, or tried to, but Entreri easily cut him short. \"You could have done it?\" the assassin asked incredulously.\\n\\n Jarlaxle stammered to reply. \"Of course.\"\\n\\n \"But you did not?\"\\n\\n \"I saw no reason to drop the tower as soon as I knew that I could...\" Jarlaxle started to explain, but when he actually heard the words coming out of his mouth, it hit him, and hard. He had been duped. He, the master of intrigue, had been fooled into believing that he was in control.\\n\\n \"Leave it with me,\" Entreri said to him. \"The Crystal Shard tries to manipulate me, constantly, but it has nothing to offer me that I truly desire, and thus, it has no power over me.\"\\n\\n \"It will wear at you,\" Jarlaxle told him. \"It will find every weakness and exploit them.\"\\n\\n Entreri nodded. \"Its time is running short,\" he remarked.\\n\\n Jarlaxle looked at him curiously.\\n\\n \"I would not have spent the energy and the time pulling you away from those wretches if I did not have a plan,\" the assassin remarked.\\n\\n \"Tell me.\"\\n\\n \"In time,\" the assassin promised. \"Now I beg of you not to take the Crystal Shard, and I beg of you, too, to allow me to rest.\"\\n\\n He settled back and closed his eyes, knowing full well that the only defense he would have if Jarlaxle came at him was the Crystal Shard. He knew that if he used the artifact, it would likely find many, many ways to weaken his defenses and the effect might be that he would abandon his mission and simply let the artifact become his guide.\\n\\n His guide to destruction, he knew, and perhaps to a fate worse than death.\\n\\n When Entreri looked at Jarlaxle, he was somewhat comforted, for he saw again that clever and opportunistic demeanor, that visage of one who thought things through carefully before taking any definitive and potentially rash actions. Given all that Entreri had just explained to the mercenary drow, the retrieval of Crenshinibon would have to fall into that very category. No, he trusted that Jarlaxle would not move against him. The mercenary drow would let things play out a bit longer before making any move to alter a situation he obviously didn\u0027t fully comprehend.\\n\\n With that thought in mind, Entreri fell fast asleep.\\n\\n Even as he was drifting off, he felt the healing magic of Jarlaxle\u0027s orb falling over him again.\\n\\n The halfling was surprised to see her fingers trembling as she carefully unrolled the note.\\n\\n \"Why Artemis, I did not even know you could write,\" Dwahvel said with a snicker, for the lines on the parchment were beautifully constructed, if a bit spare and efficient for Dwahvel\u0027s flamboyant flair. \"My dear Dwahvel,\" she read aloud, and she paused and considered the words, not certain how she should take that greeting. Was it a formal and proper heading, or a sign of true friendship?\\n\\n It occurred to the halfling then how little she really understood what went on inside of the heart of Artemis Entreri. The assassin had always claimed that his only desire was to be the very best, but if that was true why didn\u0027t he put the Crystal Shard to devastating use soon after acquiring it? And Dwahvel knew that he had it. Her contacts at Dallabad had described in detail the tumbling of the crystalline towers, and the flight of a human, Entreri, and a dark elf, whom Dwahvel had to believe must be Jarlaxle.\\n\\n All indications were that Entreri\u0027s plan had succeeded. Even without her eyewitness accounts and despite the well- earned reputations of his adversaries, Dwahvel had never doubted the man.\\n\\n The halfling moved to her doorway and made certain it was locked. Then she took a seat at her small night table and placed the parchment flat upon it, holding down the ends with paperweights fashioned of huge jewels, and read on, deciding to hold her analysis for the second read through.\\n\\n My dear Dwahvel,\\n\\n And so the time has come for us to part ways, and I do so with more than a small measure of regret. I will miss our talks, my little friend. Rarely have I known one I could trust enough to so speak what was truly on my mind. I will do so now, one final time, not in any hopes that you will advise me of my way, but only so that I might more clearly come to understand my own feelings on these matters... but that was always the beauty of our talks, was it not?\\n\\n Now that I consider those discussions, I recognize that you rarely offered any advice. In fact, you rarely spoke at all but simply listened. As I listened to my own words, and in hearing them, in explaining my thoughts and feelings to another, I came to sort them through. Was it your expressions, a simple nod, an arched eyebrow, that led me purposefully down different roads of reasoning?\\n\\n I know not.\\n\\n I know not-that has apparently become the litany of my existence, Dwahvel. I feel as if the foundation upon which I have built my beliefs and actions is not a solid thing, but one as shifting as the sands of the desert. When I was younger, I knew all the answers to all the questions. I existed in a world of surety and certainty. Now that I am older, now that I have seen four decades of life, the only thing I know for certain is that I know nothing for certain.\\n\\n It was so much easier to be a young man of twenty, so much easier to walk the world with a purpose grounded in-\\n\\n Grounded in hatred, I suppose, and in the need to be the very best at my dark craft. That was my purpose, to be the greatest warrior in all of the world, to etch my name into the histories of Faerun. So many people believed that I wished to achieve that out of simple pride, that I wanted people to tremble at the mere mention of my name for the sake of my vanity.\\n\\n They were partially right, I suppose. We are all vain, whatever arguments we might make against the definition. For me, though, the desire to further my reputation was not as important as the desire-no, not the desire, but the need- truly to be the very best at my craft. I welcomed the increase in reputation, not for the sake of my pride, but because I knew that having such fear weaving through the emotional armor of my opponents gave me even more of an advantage.\\n\\n A trembling hand does not thrust the blade true.\\n\\n I still aspire to the pinnacle, fear not, but only because it offers me some purpose in a life that increasingly brings me no joy.\\n\\n It seems a strange twist to me that I learned of the barren nature of my world only when I defeated the one person who tried in so many ways to show that very thing to me. Drizzt Do\u0027Urden-how I still hate him! - perceived my life as an empty thing, a hollow trapping with no true benefit and no true happiness. I never really disagreed with his assessment, I merely believed that it did not matter. His reason for living was ever based upon his friends and community, while mine was more a life of the self. Either way, it seems to me as if it is just a play, and a pointless one, an act for the pleasure of the viewing gods, a walk that takes us up hills we perceive as huge, but that are really just little mounds, and through valleys that appear so very deep, but are really nothing at all that truly matters. All the pettiness of life itself is my complaint, I fear.\\n\\n Or perhaps it was not Drizzt who showed me the shifting sands beneath my feet. Perhaps it was Dwahvel, who gave to me something I\u0027ve rarely known and never known well.\\n\\n A friend? I am still not certain that I understand the concept, but if I ever bother to attempt to sort through it, I will use our time together as a model.\\n\\n Thus, this is perhaps a letter of apology. I should not have forced Sharlotta Vespers upon you, though I trust that you tortured her to death as I instructed and buried her far, far away.\\n\\n How many times you asked me my plans, and always I merely laughed, but you should know, dear Dwahvel, that my intent is to steal a great and powerful artifact before other interested parties get their hands upon it. It is a desperate attempt, I know, but I cannot help myself, for the artifact calls to me, demands of me that I take it from its current, less-than-able wielder.\\n\\n So I will have it, because I am indeed the best at my craft, and I will be gone, far, far from this place, perhaps never to return.\\n\\n Farewell, Dwahvel Tiggerwillies, in whatever venture you attempt. You owe me nothing, I assure you, and yet I feel as if I am in your debt. The road before me is long and fraught with peril, but I have my goal in sight. If I attain it, nothing will truly bring me any harm. Farewell!\\n\\n - AE\\n\\n Dwahvel Tiggerwillies pushed aside the parchment and wiped a tear from her eye, and laughed at the absurdity of it all. If anyone had told her months before that she would regret the day Artemis Entreri walked out of her life, she would have laughed at him and called him a fool.\\n\\n But here it was, a letter as intimate as any of the discussions Dwahvel had shared with Entreri. She found that she missed those discussions already, or perhaps she lamented that there would be no such future talks with the man. None in the near future, at least.\\n\\n Entreri would also miss those talks by his own words. That struck Dwahvel profoundly. To think that she had so engaged this man-this killer who had secretly ruled Calimport\u0027s streets off and on for more than twenty years. Had anyone ever become so close to Artemis Entreri?\\n\\n None who were still alive, Dwahvel knew.\\n\\n She reread the ending of the letter, the obvious lies concerning Entreri\u0027s intentions. He had taken care not to mention anything that would tell the remaining dark elves that Dwahvel knew anything about them or the stolen artifact, or anything about his proffering of the Crystal Shard. His lie about his instructions concerning Sharlotta certainly added even more security to Dwahvel, buying her, should the need arise, some compassion from the woman and her secret backers.\\n\\n That thought sent a shudder along Dwahvel\u0027s spine. She really didn\u0027t want to depend on the compassion of dark elves!\\n\\n It would not come to that, she realized. Even if the trail led to her and her establishment, she could willingly and eagerly show Sharlotta the letter and Sharlotta would then see her as a valuable asset.\\n\\n Yes, Artemis Entreri had taken great pains to cover Dwahvel\u0027s efforts in the conspiracy, and that, more than any of the kind words he had written to her, revealed to her the depth of their friendship.\\n\\n \"Run far, my friend, and hide in deep holes,\" she whispered.\\n\\n She gently rerolled the parchment and placed it in one of the drawers of her crafted bureau. The sound of that closing drawer resonated hard against Dwahvel\u0027s heart.\\n\\n She would indeed miss Artemis Entreri.\\n\\n Part 3\\n\\n NOW WHAT?\\n\\n There is a simple beauty in the absolute ugliness of demons. There is no ambiguity there, no hesitation, no misconception, about how one must deal with such creatures. You do not parlay with demons. You do not hear their lies. You cast them out, destroy them, rid the world of them-even if the temptation is present to utilize their powers to save what you perceive to be a little corner of goodness.\\n\\n This is a difficult concept for many to grasp and has been the downfall of many wizards and priests who have errantly summoned demons and allowed the creatures to move beyond their initial purpose-the answering of a question, perhaps-because they were tempted by the power offered by the creature. Many of these doomed spellcasters thought they would be doing good by forcing the demons to their side, by bolstering their cause, their army, with demonic soldiers. What ill, they supposed, if the end result proved to the greater good? Would not a goodly king be well advised to add \"controlled\" demons to his cause if goblins threatened his lands?\\n\\n I think not, because if the preservation of goodness relies upon the use of such obvious and irredeemable evil to defeat evil, then there is nothing, truly, worth saving.\\n\\n The sole use of demons, then, is to bring them forth only in times when they must betray the cause of evil, and only in a setting so controlled that there is no hope of their escape. Cadderly has done this within the secure summoning chamber of the Spirit Soaring, as have, I am sure, countless priests and wizards. Such a summoning is not without peril, though, even if the circle of protection is perfectly formed, for there is always a temptation that goes with the manipulation of powers such as a balor or a nalfeshnie.\\n\\n Within that temptation must always lie the realization of irredeemable evil. Irredeemable. Without hope. That concept, redemption, must be the crucial determinant in any such dealings. Temper your blade when redemption is possible, hold it when redemption is at hand, and strike hard and without remorse when your opponent is beyond any hope of redemption.\\n\\n Where on that scale does Artemis Entreri lie, I wonder? Is the man truly beyond help and hope?\\n\\n Yes, to the former, I believe, and no to the latter. There is no help for Artemis Entreri because the man would never accept any. His greatest flaw is his pride- not the boasting pride of so many lesser warriors, but the pride of absolute independence and unbending self-reliance. I could tell him his errors, as could anyone who has come to know him in any way, but he would not hear my words.\\n\\n Yet perhaps there may be hope of some redemption for the man. I know not the source of his anger, though it must have been great. And yet I will not allow that the source, however difficult and terrible it might have been, in any way excuses the man from his actions. The blood on Entreri\u0027s sword and trademark dagger is his own to wear.\\n\\n He does not wear it well, I believe. It burns at his skin as might the breath of a black dragon and gnaws at all that is within him. I saw that during our last encounter, a quiet and dull ache at the side of his dark eyes. I had him beaten, could have killed him, and I believe that in many ways he hoped I would finish the task and be done with it, and end his mostly self-imposed suffering.\\n\\n That ache is what held my blade, that hope within me that somewhere deep inside Artemis Entreri there is the understanding that his path needs to change, that the road he currently walks is one of emptiness and ultimate despair. Many thoughts coursed my mind as I stood there, weapons in hand, with him defenseless before me. How could I strike when I saw that pain in his eyes and knew that such pain might well be the precursor to redemption? And yet how could I not, when I was well\\n\\n aware that letting Artemis Entreri walk out of that crystalline tower might spell the doom of others?\\n\\n Truly it was a dilemma, a crisis of conscience and of balance. I found my answer in that critical moment in the memory of my father, Zaknafein. To Entreri\u0027s thinking, I know, he and Zaknafein are not so different, and there are indeed similarities. Both existed in an environment hostile and to their respective perceptions evil. Neither, to their perceptions, did either go out of his way to kill anyone who did not deserve it. Are the warriors and assassins who fight for the wretched pashas of Calimport any better than the soldiers of the drow houses? Thus, in many ways, the actions of Zaknafein and those of Artemis Entreri are quite similar. Both existed in a world of intrigue, danger, and evil. Both survived their imprisonment through ruthless means. If Entreri views his world, his prison, as full of wretchedness as Zaknafein viewed Menzoberranzan, then is not Entreri as entitled to his manner as was Zaknafein, the weapons master who killed many, many dark elves in his tenure as patron of House Do\u0027Urden?\\n\\n It is a comparison I realized when first I went to Calimport, in pursuit of Entreri, who had taken Regis as prisoner (and even that act had justification, I must admit), and a comparison that truly troubled me. How close are they, given their abilities with the blade and their apparent willingness to kill? Was it, then, some inner feelings for Zaknafein that stayed my blade when I could have cut Entreri down?\\n\\n No, I say, and I must believe, for Zaknafein was far more discerning in whom he would kill or would not kill. I know the truth of Zaknafein\u0027s heart. I know that Zaknafein was possessed of the ability to love, and the reality of Artemis Entreri simply cannot hold up against that.\\n\\n Not in his present incarnation, at least, but is there hope that the man will find a light beneath the murderous form of the assassin?\\n\\n Perhaps, and I would be glad indeed to hear that the man so embraced that light. In truth, though, I doubt that anyone or anything will ever be able to pull that lost\\n\\n flame of compassion through the thick and seemingly impenetrable armor of dispassion that Artemis Entreri now wears. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/servant-of-the-shard-paths-of-darkness-3/page-16.html","bookId":2138,"book":{"id":2138,"title":"Servant of the Shard (Paths of Darkness #3)","description":"Storyline: Servant of the Shard (Paths of Darkness #3) \\n With each kill, I grow wiser, and with added wisdom, I grow stronger.
