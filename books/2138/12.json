{"id":95376,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"GROUNDWORK It is what you desired all along, Kimmuriel said to Yharaskrik. The illithid feigned surprise at the drow psionicist\u0027s blunt proposition. Yharaskrik had explaining to Kimmuriel how he might fend the intrusions of the Crystal Shard. The illithid desired that the situation be brought to this very point all along. Who will possess it? Yharaskrik silently asked. Kimmuriel or Rai-guy? Rai-guy, the drow answered. He and Crenshinibon will perfectly complement one another-by Crenshinibon\u0027s own importations to him from afar. So you both believe, the illithid responded. Perhaps, though, Crenshinibon sees you as a threat-a likely and logical assumption-and is merely goading you into this so that you and your comrades might be thoroughly destroyed. I have not dismissed that possibility, Kimmuriel returned, seeming quite at ease. That is why I have come to Yharaskrik. The illithid paused for a long while, digesting the information. The Crystal Shard is no minor item, the creature explained. To ask of me- A temporary reprieve, Kimmuriel interrupted. I do not wish to pit Yharaskrik against Crenshinibon, for I understand that the artifact would overwhelm you. He imparted those thoughts without fear of insulting the mind flayer. Kimmuriel understood that the perfectly logical illithids were not possessed of ego beyond reason. Certainly they believed their race to be superior to most others, to humans, of course, and even to drow, but within that healthy confidence there lay an element of reason that prevented them from taking insult to statements made of perfect logic. Yharaskrik knew that the artifact could overwhelm any creature short of a god. There is, perhaps, a way, the illithid replied, and Kimmuriel\u0027s smile widened. A Tower of Iron Will\u0027s sphere of influence could encompass Crenshinibon and defeat its mental intrusions, and its commands to any towers it has constructed near the battlefield. Temporarily, the creature added emphatically. I hold no illusions that any psionic force short of that conducted by a legion of my fellow illithids could begin to permanently weaken the powers of the great Crystal Shard. \"Long enough for the downfall of Jarlaxle,\" Kimmuriel agreed aloud. That is all that I require.\" He bowed and took his leave then, and his last words echoed in his mind as he stepped through the dimensional doorway that would bring him back to Calimport and the private quarters he shared with Rai-guy. The downfall of Jarlaxle! Kimmuriel could hardly believe that he was a party to this conspiracy. Hadn\u0027t it been Jarlaxle, after all, who had offered him refuge from his own Matron Mother and vicious female siblings of House Oblodra, and who had then taken him in and sheltered him from the rest of the city when Matron Baenre had declared that House Oblodra must be completely eradicated? Aside from any loyalty he held for the mercenary leader, there remained the practical matter of the problem of decapitating Bregan D\u0027aerthe. Jarlaxle above all others had facilitated the rise of the mercenary band, had brought them to prominence more than a century before, and no one in all the band, not even self-confident Rai-guy, doubted for a moment how important Jarlaxle was politically for the survival of Bregan D\u0027aerthe. All those thoughts stayed with Kimmuriel as he made his way back to Rai-guy\u0027s side, to find the drow thick into the plotting of the attacks they would use to bring Jarlaxle down. \"Your new friend can give us that which we require?\" the eager wizard-cleric asked as soon as Kimmuriel arrived. \"Likely,\" Kimmuriel replied. \"Neutralize the Crystal Shard, and the attack will be complete,\" Rai-guy said. \"Do not underestimate Jarlaxle,\" Kimmuriel warned. \"He has the Crystal Shard now and so we must first eliminate that powerful item, but even without it, Jarlaxle has spent many years solidifying his hold on Bregan D\u0027aerthe. I would not have gone against him before the acquisition of the artifact.\" \"But it is just that acquisition that has weakened him,\" Rai-guy explained. \"Even the common soldiers fear this course we have taken.\" \"I have heard some remark that they cannot believe our rise in power,\" Kimmuriel argued. \"Some have proclaimed that we will dominate the surface world, that Jarlaxle will take Bregan D\u0027aerthe to prominence among the weakling humans, and return in glory to conquer Menzoberranzan.\" Rai-guy laughed aloud at the proclamation. \"The artifact is powerful, I do not doubt, but it is limited. Did not the mind flayer tell you that Crenshinibon sought to reach its limit of control?\" \"Whether or not the fantasy conquest can occur is irrelevant to our present situation,\" Kimmuriel replied. \"What matters is whether or not the soldiers of Bregan D\u0027aerthe believe in it.\" Rai-guy didn\u0027t have an argument for that line of reasoning, but still, he wasn\u0027t overly concerned. \"Though Berg\u0027inyon is with us, the drow will be limited in their role in the battle,\" he explained. \"We have humans at our disposal now and thousands of kobolds.\" \"Many of the humans were brought into our fold by Crenshinibon,\" Kimmuriel reminded. \"The Crystal Shard will have little difficulty in dominating the kobolds, if Yharaskrik cannot completely neutralize it.\" \"And we have the wererats,\" Rai-guy went on, unfazed. \"Shapechangers are better suited to resisting mental intrusions. Their internal strife denies any outside influences.\" \"You have enlisted Domo?\" Rai-guy shook his head. \"Domo is difficult,\" he admitted, \"but I have enlisted several of his wererat lieutenants. They will fall to our cause if Domo is eliminated. To that end, I have had Sharlotta Vespers inform Jarlaxle that the wererat leader has been speaking out of turn, revealing too much about Bregan D\u0027aerthe, to Pasha Da\u0027Daclan, and we believe to the leader of the guild that came to investigate Dallabad.\" Kimmuriel nodded, but his expression remained concerned. Jarlaxle was a tough opponent in games of the mind-he might see the ruse for what it was, and use Domo to turn the wererats back to his side. \"His actions now will be telling,\" Rai-guy admitted. \"Crenshinibon, no doubt, will want to believe Sharlotta\u0027s tale, but Jarlaxle will desire to proceed more cautiously before acting against Domo.\" \"You believe that the wererat leader will be dead this very day,\" Kimmuriel reasoned after a moment. Rai-guy smiled. \"The Crystal Shard has become Jarlaxle\u0027s strength and thus his weakness,\" he said with a wicked grin. \"First the gauntlet and now this,\" Dwahvel Tiggerwillies said with a profound sigh. \"Ah, Entreri, what shall I ever do for extra coin when you are no more?\" Entreri didn\u0027t appreciate the humor. \"Be quick about it,\" he instructed. \"Sharlotta\u0027s actions have made you very nervous,\" Dwahvel remarked, for she had observed the woman busily working the streets during the last few hours, with many of her meetings with known operatives of the wererat guild. Entreri just nodded, not wanting to share the latest news with Dwahvel-just in case. Things were moving fast now, he knew, too fast. Rai-guy and Kimmuriel were laying the groundwork for their assault, but at least Jarlaxle had apparently caught on to some of the budding problems. The mercenary leader had summoned Entreri just a few moments before, telling the man that he had to go and meet with a particularly wretched wererat by the name of Domo. If Domo was in on the conspiracy, Entreri suspected that Rai-guy and Kimmuriel would soon have a hole to fill in their ranks. \"I will return within two hours,\" Entreri explained. \"Have it ready.\" \"We have no proper material to make such an item as you requested,\" Dwahvel complained. \"Color and consistency alone,\" Entreri replied. \"The material does not need to be exact.\" Dwahvel shrugged. Entreri went out into Calimport\u0027s night, moving swiftly, his cloak pulled tight around his shoulders. Not far from the Copper Ante, he turned down an alley. Then after a quick check to ensure that he was not being followed, he slipped down an open sewer hole into the tunnels below the city. A few moments later, he stood before Jarlaxle in the appointed chamber. \"Sharlotta has informed me that Domo has been whispering secrets about us,\" Jarlaxle remarked. \"The wererat is on the way?\" Jarlaxle nodded. \"And likely with many allies. You are prepared for the fight?\" Entreri wore the first honest grin he had known in several days. Prepared for a fight with wererats? How could he not be? Still he could not dismiss the source of Jarlaxle\u0027s information. He realized that Sharlotta was working both ends of the table here, that she was in tight with Rai-guy and Kimmuriel but was in no overt way severing her ties to Jarlaxle. He doubted that Sharlotta and her drow allies had set this up as the ultimate battle for control of Bregan D\u0027aerthe. Such intricate planning would take longer, and the sewers of Calimport would not be a good location for a fight that would grow so very obvious. Still... \"Perhaps you should have stayed at Dallabad for a while,\" Entreri remarked, \"within the crystalline tower, overseeing the new operation.\" \"Domo hardly frightens me,\" Jarlaxle replied. Entreri stared at him hard. Could he really be so oblivious to the apparent underpinnings of a coup within Bregan D\u0027aerthe? If so, did that enhance the possibility that the Crystal Shard was indeed prompting the disloyal actions of Rai-guy and Kimmuriel? Or did it mean, perhaps, that Entreri was being too cautious here, was seeing demons and uprisings where there were none? The assassin took a deep breath and shook his head, clearing his thoughts. \"Sharlotta could be mistaken,\" the assassin did say. \"She would have reasons of her own to wish to be rid of troublesome Domo.\" \"We will know soon enough,\" Jarlaxle replied, nodding in the direction of a tunnel, where the wererat leader, in the form of a huge humanoid rat, was approaching, along with three other ratmen. \"My dear Domo,\" Jarlaxle greeted, and the wererat leader bowed. \"It is good that you came to us,\" Domo replied. \"I do not enjoy any journeys to the surface at this time, not even to the cellars of House Basadoni. There is too much excitement, I fear.\" Entreri narrowed his eyes and considered the wretched lycanthrope, thinking that answer curious, at least, but trying hard not to interpret it one way or the other. \"Do the agents of the other guilds similarly come down to meet with you?\" Jarlaxle asked, a question that surely set Domo back on his heels. Entreri stared hard at the drow now, catching on that Crenshinibon was instructing Jarlaxle to put Domo on his guard, to get him thinking of any potentially treasonous actions that they might be more easily read. Still, it seemed to him that Jarlaxle was moving too quickly here, that a little small talk and diplomacy might have garnered the necessary indicators without resorting to any crude mental intrusions by the sentient artifact. \"On those rare occasions when I must meet with agents of other guilds, they often do come to me,\" Domo answered, trying to remain calm, though he betrayed his sudden edge to Entreri when he shifted his weight from one foot to the other. The assassin calmly dropped his hands to his belt, hooking his wrists over the pommels of his two formidable weapons, a posture that seemed more relaxed and comfortable, but also one that had him in touch with his weapons, ready to draw and strike. \"And have you met with any recently?\" Jarlaxle asked. Domo winced, and winced again, and Entreri caught on to the truth of it. The artifact was trying to scour his thoughts then and there. The three wererats behind the leader glanced at each other and shifted nervously. Domo\u0027s face contorted, began to form into his human guise, and went back almost immediately to the trapping of the wererat. A low, feral growl escaped his throat. \"What is it?\" one of the wererats behind him asked. Entreri could see the frustration mounting on Jarlaxle\u0027s face. He glanced back to Domo curiously, wondering if he had perhaps underestimated the ugly creature. Jarlaxle and Crenshinibon simply could not get a fix on the wererat\u0027s thoughts, for the Crystal Shard\u0027s intrusion had brought about the lycanthropic internal strife, and that wall of red pain and rage had now denied any access. Jarlaxle, growing increasingly frustrated, stared at the wererat hard. He betrayed us, Crenshinibon decided suddenly. Jarlaxle\u0027s thoughts filled with doubt and confusion, for he had not seen any such revelation. A moment of weakness, came Crenshinibon\u0027s call. A flash of the truth within that wall of angry torment. He betrayed us... twice. Jarlaxle turned to Entreri, a subtle signal, but one that the eager assassin, who hated wererats profoundly, was quick to catch and amplify. Domo and his associates caught it, too, and their swords came flashing out of their scabbards. By the time they\u0027d drawn their weapons, Entreri was on the charge. Charon\u0027s Claw waved in the air before him, painting a wall of black ash that Entreri could use to segment the battleground and prevent his enemies from coordinating their movements. He spun to the left, around the ash wall, ducking as he turned so that he came around under the swing of Domo\u0027s long and slender blade. Up went the assassin\u0027s sword, taking Domo\u0027s far and wide. Entreri, still in a crouch, scrambled forward, his dagger leading. Domo\u0027s closest companion came on hard, though, forcing Entreri to skitter back and slash down with his sword to deflect the attack. He went into a roll, over backward, and planted his right hand, pushing hard to launch him back to his feet, working those feet quickly as he landed to put him in nearly the same position as when he had started. The foolish wererat followed, leaving Domo and its two companions on the other side of the ash wall. Behind Entreri, Jarlaxle\u0027s hand pumped once, twice, thrice, and daggers sailed past Entreri, barely missing his head, plunging through the ash wall, blasting holes in the drifting curtain. On the other side came a groan, and Entreri realized that Domo\u0027s companions were down to two. A moment later, down to one, for the assassin met the wererat\u0027s charge full on, his sword coming up in a rotating fashion, taking the thrusting blade aside. Entreri continued forward, and so did the wererat, thinking to bite at the man. How quickly it regretted that choice when Entreri\u0027s dagger blade filled its mouth. A sudden second thrust yanked the creature\u0027s head back, and the assassin disengaged and quickly turned. He saw yet another of the beasts coming fast through the ash wall and heard the footsteps of a retreating Domo. Down he went into a shoulder roll, under the ash wall, catching the ankles of the charging wererat and sending it flying over him to fall facedown right before Jarlaxle. Entreri didn\u0027t even slow, rolling forward and back to his feet and running off full speed in pursuit of the fleeing wererat. Entreri was no stranger to the darkness, even the complete blackness of the tunnels. Indeed, he had done some of his best work down there, but recognizing the disadvantage he faced against infravision-using wererats, he held his powerful sword before him and commanded it to bring forth light-hoping that it, like many magical swords, could produce some sort of glow. That magical glow surprised him, for it was a light of blackish hue and nothing like Entreri had ever seen before, giving all the corridor a surrealistic appearance. He glanced down at the sword, trying to see how blatant a light source it appeared, but he saw no definitive glow and hoped that meant that he might use a bit of stealth, at least, despite the fact that he was the source of the light. He came to a fork and skidded to a stop, turning his head and focusing his senses. The slight echo of a footfall came from the left, so on he ran. Jarlaxle finished the prone wererat in short order, pumping his arm repeatedly and hitting the squirming creature with dagger after dagger. He put a hand in his pocket, on the Crystal Shard, as he ran through the gap in the ash wall, trying to catch up with his companion. Guide me, he instructed the artifact. Up, came the unexpected reply. They have returned to the streets. Jarlaxle skidded to a stop, puzzled. Up! came the more emphatic silent cry. To the streets. The mercenary leader rushed back the other way, down the corridor to the ladder that would take him back up through the sewer grate and into the alley outside the neighborhood of the Copper Ante. Guide me, he instructed the shard again. We are too exposed, the artifact returned. Keep to the shadows and move back to House Basadoni-Artemis Entreri and Domo lie in that direction. Entreri rounded a bend in the corridor, slowing cautiously. There, standing before him, was Domo and two more wererats, all holding swords. Entreri started forward, thinking himself seen, and figuring to attack before the three could organize their defenses. He stopped abruptly, though, when the ratman to Dome\u0027s left whispered. \"I smell him. He is near.\" \"Too near,\" agreed the other lesser creature, squinting, the tell-tale red glow of infravision evident in its eyes. Why did they even need that infravision? Entreri wondered. He could see them clearly in the black light of Charon\u0027s Claw, as clearly as if they were all standing in a dimly lit room. He knew that he should go straight in and attack, but his curiosity was piqued now and so he stepped out from the wall, in clear view, in plain sight. \"His smell is thick,\" Domo agreed. All three were glancing about nervously, their swords waving. \"Where are the others?\" \"They have not come but should have been here,\" the one to his left answered. \"I fear we are betrayed.\" \"Damn the drow to the Nine Hells, then,\" Domo said. Entreri could hardly believe they could not see him-yet another wondrous effect of the marvelous sword. He wondered if perhaps they could see him had they been focusing their eyes in the normal spectrum of light, but that, he realized, had to be a question for another day. Concentrating now on moving perfectly silently, he slid one foot, and then the other, ahead of him, moving to Domo\u0027s right. \"Perhaps we should have listened more carefully to the dark elf wizard,\" the one to the left went on, his voice a whisper. \"To go against Jarlaxle?\" Domo asked incredulously. \"That is doom. Nothing more.\" \"But...\" the other started to argue, but Domo began whispering harshly, sticking his finger in the other\u0027s face. Entreri used their distraction to get right up behind the third of the group, his dagger tip coming against the wererat\u0027s spine. The creature stiffened as Entreri whispered into its ear. \"Run,\" he said. The ratman sped off down the corridor, and Domo stopped his arguing long enough to chase his fleeing soldier a few steps, calling threats out after him. \"Run,\" said Entreri, who had shifted across the way to the side of the remaining lesser wererat. This one, though, didn\u0027t run, but let out a shriek and spun, its sword slashing across at chest level. Entreri ducked below the blade easily and came up with a stab that brought his deadly jeweled dagger under the wererat\u0027s ribs and up into its diaphragm. The creature howled again, but then spasmed and convulsed violently. \"What is it?\" Domo asked, spinning about. \"What?\" The wererat fell to the floor, twitching still as it died. Entreri stood there, in the open, dagger in hand. He called up a glow from his smaller blade. Domo jumped back, bringing his sword out in front of him. \"Dancing blade?\" he asked quietly. \"Is this you, wizard drow?\" \"Dancing blade?\" Entreri repeated quietly, looking down at his glowing dagger. It made no sense to him. He looked back to Domo, to see the glow leave the wererat\u0027s eyes as he shifted from ratman, to nearly human form. Likewise his vision shifted from the infrared to the normal viewing spectrum. He nearly jumped out of his boots again, as the specter of Artemis Entreri came clear to him. \"What trick is that?\" the wererat gasped. Entreri wasn\u0027t even sure how to answer. He had no idea what Charon\u0027s Claw was doing with its black light. Did it block infravision completely but apparently hold a strange illuminating effect that was clearly visible in the normal spectrum? Did it act like a black campfire then, even though Entreri felt no heat coming from the blade? Infravision could be severely limited by strong heat sources. It was indeed intriguing-one of so many riddles that seemed to be presenting themselves before Artemis Entreri- but again, it was a riddle to be solved another day. \"So you are without allies,\" he said to Domo. \"It is you and I alone.\" \"Why does Jarlaxle fear me?\" Domo asked as Entreri advanced a step. The assassin stopped. \"Fear you? Or loathe you? They are not the same thing, you know.\" \"I am his ally!\" Domo protested. \"I stood beside him, even against the advances of his lessers.\" \"So you said to him,\" Entreri remarked, glancing down at the still-twitching, still-groaning form. \"What do you know? Speak it clearly and quickly, and perhaps you will walk out of here.\" Domo\u0027s rodent eyes narrowed angrily. \"As Rassiter walked away from your last meeting?\" he asked, referring to one of his greatest predecessors in the wererat guild, a powerful leader who had served Pasha Pook along with Entreri, and whom Entreri had subsequently murdered- a deed never forgotten by the wererats of Calimport. \"I ask you one last time,\" Entreri said calmly. He caught a slight movement to the side and knew that the first wererat had returned, waiting in the shadows to leap out at him. He was hardly surprised and hardly afraid. Domo gave a wide, toothy smile. \"Jarlaxle and his companions are not as unified a force as you believe,\" he teased. Entreri advanced another step. \"You must do better than that,\" he said, but before the words even left his mouth, Domo howled and leaped at him, stabbing with his slender sword. Entreri barely moved Charon\u0027s Claw, just angled the blade to intercept Domo\u0027s and slide it off to the side. The wererat retracted the strike at once, thrust again, and again. Each time Entreri, with barely any motion at all, positioned his parry perfectly and to a razor-thin angle, with Dome\u0027s sword stabbing past him, missing by barely an inch. Again the wererat retracted and this time came across with a great slash. But he had stepped too far back, and Entreri had to lean only slightly backward for the blade to swish harmlessly past before him. The expected charge came from Domo\u0027s companion in the shadows to the side, and Domo played his part in the routine perfectly, rushing ahead with a powerful thrust. Domo didn\u0027t understand the beauty, the efficiency, of Artemis Entreri. Again Charon\u0027s Claw caught and turned the attack, but this time, Entreri rolled his hand right over, and under the outside of Domo\u0027s blade. He pulled in his gut as he threw Domo\u0027s blade up high, and brought forth another wall of ash, blackening the air between him and the wererat. Following his own momentum, Entreri went into a complete spin, around to the right. As he came back square with Domo he brought his right arm swishing down, the sword trailing ash, while his left crossed his body over the down-swing, launching his jeweled dagger right into the gut of the charging wererat. Charon\u0027s Claw did a complete circuit in the air between the combatants, forming a wide, circular wall. Domo came ahead right through it with yet another stubborn thrust, but Entreri wasn\u0027t there. He dived to the side into a roll and came up and around with a powerful slash at the legs of the wererat still struggling with the dagger in its belly. To the assassin\u0027s surprise and delight, the mighty sword sheared through not only the wererat\u0027s closest knee, but through the other as well. The creature tumbled to the stone, howling in agony, its life-blood pouring out freely. Entreri hardly slowed, spinning about and coming up powerfully, slapping Domo\u0027s sword out wide yet again, and snapping Charon\u0027s Claw down and across to pick off a dagger neatly thrown by the wererat leader. Domo\u0027s expression changed quickly then, his last trick obviously played. Now it was Entreri\u0027s turn to take the offensive, and he did so with a powerful thrust high, thrust center, thrust low routine that had Domo inevitably skittering backward, fighting hard merely to keep his balance. Entreri, leaping ahead, didn\u0027t make it any easier on the overmatched creature. His sword worked furiously, sometimes throwing ash, sometimes not, and all with a precision designed to limit Dome\u0027s vision and options. Soon he had the wererat nearly to the back wall, and a glance from Domo told Entreri that he wasn\u0027t thrilled about the prospect of getting cornered. Entreri took the cue to slash and slash again, bringing up a wall of ash perpendicular to the floor then perpendicular to the first, an L-shaped design that blocked Domo\u0027s vision of Entreri and his vision of the area to his immediate right. With a growl, the wererat went right with a desperate thrust, thinking that Entreri would use the ash wall to try to work around him. He hit only air. Then he felt the assassin\u0027s presence at his back, for the man, anticipating the anticipation, had simply gone around the other way. Domo threw his sword to the ground. \"I will tell you everything,\" he cried. \"I will-\" \"You already did,\" Entreri assured him and the wererat stiffened as Charon\u0027s Claw sliced through his backbone and drove on to the hilt, coming out the front just below Domo\u0027s ribs. \"It... hurts,\" Domo gasped. \"It is supposed to,\" Entreri replied, and he gave the sword a sudden jerk, and Domo gasped, and he died. Entreri tore his blade free and rushed to retrieve his dagger. His thoughts were whirling now, as Domo\u0027s confirmation of some kind of an uprising within Bregan D\u0027aerthe incited a plethora of questions. Domo had not been Jarlaxle\u0027s deceiver, nor was he in on the plotting against the mercenary leader-of that much, at least, Entreri was pretty sure. Yet it was Jarlaxle who had prompted this attack on Domo. Or was it? Wondering just how much the Crystal Shard was playing Jarlaxle\u0027s best interests against Jarlaxle, Artemis Entreri scrambled out of Calimport\u0027s sewers. \"Beautiful,\" Rai-guy remarked to Kimmuriel, the two of them using a mirror of scrying to witness Artemis Entreri\u0027s return to House Basadoni. The wizard broke the connection almost immediately after, though, for the look upon the cunning assassin\u0027s face told him that Entreri might be sensing the scrying. \"He unwittingly does our bidding. The wererats will stand against Jarlaxle now.\" \"Alas for Domo,\" Kimmuriel said, laughing. He stopped abruptly, though, and assumed a more serious demeanor. \"But what of Entreri? He is formidable-even more so with that gauntlet and sword-and is too wise to believe that he would be better served in joining our cause. Perhaps we should eliminate him before turning our eyes toward Jarlaxle.\" Rai-guy thought it over for just a moment, and nodded his agreement. \"It must come from a lesser,\" he said. \"From Sharlotta and her minions, perhaps, as they will be little involved in the greater coup.\" \"Jarlaxle would not be pleased if he came to understand that we were going against Entreri,\" Kimmuriel agreed. \"Sharlotta, then, and not as a straightforward command. I will plant the thought in her that Entreri is trying to eliminate her.\" \"If she came to believe that, she would likely simply run away,\" Rai-guy remarked. \"She is too full of pride for that,\" Kimmuriel came back. \"I will also make it clear to her, subtly and through other sources, that Entreri is not in the favor of many of Bregan D\u0027aerthe, that even Jarlaxle has grown tired of his independence. If she believes that Entreri stands alone in some vendetta or rivalry against her, and that she can utilize the veritable army at her disposal to destroy him, then she will not run but will strike and strike hard.\" He gave another laugh. \"Though unlike you, Rai-guy, I am not so certain that Sharlotta and all of House Basadoni will be able to get the job done.\" \"They will keep him occupied and out of our way, at least,\" Rai-guy replied. \"Once we have finished with Jarlaxle...\" \"Entreri will likely be far gone,\" Kimmuriel observed, \"running as Morik has run. Perhaps we should see to Morik, if for no other reason than to hold him up as an example to Artemis Entreri.\" Rai-guy shook his head, apparently recognizing that he and Kimmuriel had far more pressing problems than the disposition of a minor deserter in a faraway and insignificant city. \"Artemis Entreri cannot run far enough away,\" he said determinedly. \"He is far too great a nuisance for me ever to forget him or forgive him.\" Kimmuriel thought that statement might be a bit extravagant, but in essence, he agreed with the sentiment. Perhaps Entreri\u0027s greatest crime was his own ability, the drow psionicist mused. Perhaps his rise above the standards of humans alone was the insult that so sparked hatred in Rai-guy and in Kimmuriel. The psionicist, and the wizard as well, were wise enough to appreciate that truth. But that didn\u0027t make things any easier for Artemis Entreri.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/servant-of-the-shard-paths-of-darkness-3/page-12.html","bookId":2138,"book":{"id":2138,"title":"Servant of the Shard (Paths of Darkness #3)","description":"Storyline: Servant of the Shard (Paths of Darkness #3) With each kill, I grow wiser, and with added wisdom, I grow stronger.
