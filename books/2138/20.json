{"id":95384,"no":20,"title":"Page 20","content":"BECAUSE HE NEVER HAD TO\n Entreri frowned when he glanced from the not-too-distant village to his ridiculously plumed drow companion. The hat alone, with its wide brim and huge diatryma feather that always grew back after Jarlaxle used it to summon a real giant bird, would invite suspicion and likely open disdain, from the farmers of the village. Then there was the fact that the wearer was a dark elf....\n \"You really should consider a disguise,\" Entreri said dryly, and shook his head, wishing he still had a particular magic item, a mask that could transform the wearer\u0027s appearance. Drizzt Do\u0027Urden had once used the thing to get from the northlands around Waterdeep all the way to Calimport disguised as a surface elf.\n \"I have considered a disguise,\" the drow replied, and to Entreri\u0027s-temporary-relief, he pulled the hat from his head. A good start, it seemed.\n Jarlaxle merely brushed the thing off and plopped it right back in place. \"You wear one, as well,\" the drow protested to Entreri\u0027s scowl, pointing to the small-brimmed black hat Entreri now wore. The hat was called a bolero, named after the drow wizard who had given it its tidy shape and had imbued it, and several others of the same make, with certain magical properties.\n \"Not the hat!\" the frustrated Entreri replied, and he rubbed a hand across his face. \"These are simple farmers, likely with very definite feelings about dark elves- and likely, those feelings are not favorable.\"\n \"For most dark elves, I would agree with them,\" said Jarlaxle, and he ended there, and merely kept riding on his way toward the village, as if Entreri had said nothing to him at all.\n \"Hence, the disguise,\" the assassin called after him. \"Indeed,\" said Jarlaxle, and he kept on riding. Entreri kicked his heels into his horse\u0027s flanks, spurring the mount into a quick canter to bring him up beside the elusive drow. \"I mean that you should consider wearing one,\" Entreri said plainly.\n \"But I am,\" the drow replied. \"And you, Artemis Entreri, above all others, should recognize me! I am Drizzt Do\u0027Urden, your most hated rival.\"\n \"What?\" the assassin asked incredulously. \"Drizzt Do\u0027Urden, the perfect disguise for me,\" Jarlaxle casually replied. \"Does not Drizzt walk openly from town to town, neither hiding nor denying his heritage, even in those places where he is not well-known?\" \"Does he?\" Entreri asked slyly.\n \"Did he not?\" Jarlaxle quickly replied, correcting the tense, for of course, as far as Artemis Entreri knew, Drizzt Do\u0027Urden was dead.\n Entreri stared hard at the drow. \"Well, did he not?\" Jarlaxle asked plainly. \"And it was Drizzt\u0027s nerve, I say, in parading about so openly, that prevented townsfolk from organizing against him and slaying him. Because he remained so obvious, it became obvious that he had nothing to hide. Thus, I use the same technique and even the same name. I am Drizzt Do\u0027Urden, hero of Ice-wind Dale, friend of King Bruenor Battlehammer of Mithral Hall, and no enemy of these simple farmers. Rather, I might be of use to them, should danger threaten.\" \"Of course,\" Entreri replied. \"Unless one of them crosses you, in which case you will destroy the entire town.\"\n \"There is always that,\" Jarlaxle admitted, but he didn\u0027t slow his mount, and he and Entreri were getting close to the village now, close enough to be seen for what they were-or at least, for what they were pretending to be.\n There were no guards about, and the pair rode in undisturbed, their horses\u0027 hooves clattering on cobblestone roads. They pulled up before one two-story building, on which hung a shingle painted with a foamy mug of mead and naming the place as\n Gent eman Briar\u0027s\n Good y P ace of Si ing\n in lettering old and weathered.\n \"Si ing,\" Jarlaxle read, scratching his head, and he gave a great and dramatic sigh. \"This is a gathering hall for those of melancholy?\"\n \"Not sighing,\" Entreri replied. He looked at Jarlaxle, snorted, and rolled off the side of his horse. \"Sitting, or perhaps sipping. Not sighing.\"\n \"Sitting, then, or sipping,\" Jarlaxle announced, looping his right leg over his horse, and rolling over backward off the mount into a somersault to land gracefully on his feet. \"Or perhaps a bit of both! Ha!\" He ended with a great gleaming smile.\n Entreri stared at him hard yet again, and just shook his head, thinking that perhaps he would have been better off leaving this one with Rai-guy and Kimmuriel.\n A dozen patrons were inside the place, ten men and a pair of women, along with a grizzled old barkeep whose snarl seemed to be eternally etched upon his stubbly face, a locked expression amidst the leathery wrinkles and acne scars. One by one, the thirteen took note of the pair entering, and inevitably, each nodded or merely glanced away, and shot a stunned expression back at the duo, particularly at the dark elf, and sent a hand to the hilt of the nearest weapon. One man even leaped up from his chair, sending it skidding out behind him.\n Entreri and Jarlaxle merely tipped their hats and moved to the bar, making no threatening movements and keeping their expressions perfectly friendly.\n \"What\u0027re ye about?\" the barkeep barked at them. \"Who\u0027re ye, and what\u0027s yer business?\"\n \"Travelers,\" Entreri answered, \"weary of the road and seeking a bit of respite.\"\n \"Well, yell not be finding it here, ye won\u0027t!\" the barkeep growled. \"Get yer hats back on yer ugly heads and get yer arses out me door!\"\n Entreri looked to Jarlaxle, who seemed perfectly unperturbed. \"I do believe we will stay a bit,\" the drow stated. \"I do understand your hesitance, good sir... good Eman Briar,\" he added, remembering the sign.\n \"Eman?\" the barkeep echoed in obvious confusion. \"Eman Briar, so says your placard,\" Jarlaxle answered innocently.\n \"Eh?\" the puzzled man asked, then his old yellow eyes lit up as he caught on, \"Gentleman Briar,\" he insisted. \"The L\u0027s all rotted away. Gentleman Briar.\"\n \"Your pardon, good sir,\" the charming and disarming Jarlaxle said with a bow. He gave a great sigh and threw a wink at Entreri\u0027s predictable scowl. \"We have come in to sigh, sit, and sip, a bit of all three. We want no trouble and bring none, I assure you. Have you not heard of me? Drizzt Do\u0027Urden of Icewind Dale, who reclaimed Mithral Hall for dwarven King Bruenor Battlehammer?\"\n \"Never heard o\u0027 no Drizzit Dudden,\" Briar replied. \"Now get ye outta me place afore me Mends and me haul ye out!\" His voice rose as he spoke, and several of the gathered men did, as well, moving together and readying their weapons.\n Jarlaxle glanced around at the lot of them, smiling, seeming perfectly amused. Entreri, too, was quite entertained by it all, but he didn\u0027t bother looking around, just leaned back on his barstool, watching his friend and trying to see how Jarlaxle might wriggle out of this one. Of course, the ragged band of farmers hardly bothered the skilled assassin, especially since he was sitting next to the dangerous Jarlaxle. If they had to leave the town in ruin, so be it.\n Thus, Entreri did not even search the ever-present silent call of the imprisoned Crystal Shard. If the artifact wanted these simple fools to take it from Entreri, then let them try!\n \"Did I not just tell you that I reclaimed a dwarven kingdom?\" Jarlaxle asked. \"And mostly without help. Hear me well, Gent Eman Briar. If you and your friends here try to expel me, your kin will be planting more than crops this season.\"\n It wasn\u0027t so much what he said as it was the manner in which he said it, so casual, so confident, so perfectly assured that this group could not begin to frighten him. The men approaching slowed to a halt, all of them glancing to the others for some sign of leadership.\n \"Truly, I desire no trouble,\" Jarlaxle said calmly. \"I have dedicated my life to erasing the prejudices-rightful conceptions, in many instances-that so many hold for my people. I am not merely a weary traveler, but a warrior for the causes of common men. If goblins attacked your fair town, I would fight beside you until they were driven away, or until my heart beat its last!\" His voice continued a dramatic climb. \"If a great dragon swooped down upon your village, I would brave its fiery breath, draw forth my weapons and leap to the parapets....\"\n \"I think they understand your point,\" Entreri said to him, grabbing him by the arm and easing him back to his seat.\n Gentleman Briar snorted. \"Ye\u0027re not even carryin\u0027 no weapon, drow,\" he observed.\n \"A thousand dead men have said the same thing,\" Entreri replied in all seriousness. Jarlaxle tipped his hat to the assassin. \"But enough banter,\" Entreri added, hopping from his seat and pulling back his cloak to reveal his two fabulous weapons, the jeweled dagger and the magnificent Charon\u0027s Claw with its distinctive bony hilt. \"If you mean to fight us, then do so now, that I can finish this business and still find a good meal, a better drink, and a warm bed before the fall of night. If not, then go back to your tables, I beg, and leave us in peace, else I\u0027ll forget my delusional paladin friend\u0027s desire to become the hero of the land.\"\n Again, the patrons glanced nervously at each other, and some grumbled under their breaths.\n \"Gentleman Briar, they await your signal,\" Entreri remarked. \"Choose well which signal that will be, or else find a way to mix blood with your drink, for you shall have gallons of it pooling about your tavern.\"\n Briar waved his hand, sending his patrons retreating to their respective tables, and gave a great snort and snarl. \"Good!\" Jarlaxle remarked, slapping his leg. \"My reputation is saved from the rash actions of my impetuous friend. Now, if you would be so kind as to fetch me a fine and delicate drink, Gentleman Briar,\" he instructed, pulling forth his purse, which was bulging with coins.\n \"I\u0027m servin\u0027 no damned drow in me tavern,\" Briar insisted, crossing his thin but muscled arms over his chest. \"Then I will gladly serve myself,\" Jarlaxle answered without hesitation, and he politely tipped his great plumed hat. \"Of course, that will mean fewer coins for you.\" Briar stared at him hard.\n Jarlaxle ignored him and stared instead at the fairly wide selection of bottles on the shelves behind the bar. He tapped a delicate finger against his lip, scrutinizing the colors, and the words of the few that were actually marked. \"Suggestions?\" he asked Entreri. \"Something to drink,\" the assassin replied. Jarlaxle pointed to one bottle, uttered a simple magical command, and snapped his finger back, and the bottle flew from the shelf to his waiting grasp. Two more points and commands had a pair of glasses sitting upon the bar before the companions.\n Jarlaxle reached for the bottle. The stunned and angry Briar snapped his hand out to grab the dark elf\u0027s arm. He never got close.\n Faster than Briar could possibly react, faster than he could think to react, Entreri snapped his hand on the bar- keep\u0027s reaching arm, slamming it down to the bar and holding it fast. In the same fluid motion, the assassin\u0027s other hand came, holding the jeweled dagger, and Entreri plunged it hard into the wooden shelf right between Gentleman Briar\u0027s fingers. The blood drained from the man\u0027s ruddy face. \"If you persist, there will be little left of your tavern,\" Entreri promised in the coldest, most threatening voice\n Gentleman Briar had ever heard. \"Enough to build a proper box to bury you in, perhaps.\" \"Doubtful,\" said Jarlaxle.\n The drow was perfectly at ease, hardly paying attention, seeming as though he had expected Entreri\u0027s intervention all along. He poured the two drinks and eased himself back, sniffing, and sipping his liquor.\n Entreri let the man go, glanced around to make sure that none of the others were moving, and slid his dagger back into its sheath on his belt.\n \"Good sir,\" Jarlaxle said. \"I tell you one more time that we have no argument with you, nor do we wish one. Our road behind us has been long and dry, and the road before us will no doubt prove equally harsh. Thus we have entered your fair tavern in this fair village. Why would you think to deny us?\"\n \"The better question is, why would you wish to be killed?\" Entreri put in.\n Gentleman Briar looked from one to the other and threw up his hands in defeat. \"To the Nine Hells with both of ye,\" he growled, spinning away.\n Entreri looked to Jarlaxle, who merely shrugged and said, \"I have already been there. Hardly worth a return visit.\" He took up his glass and the bottle and walked away. Entreri, with his own glass, followed him across the room to the one free table in the small place.\n Of course, the two tables near that one soon became empty as well, when the patrons took up their glasses and other items and scurried away from the dark elf.\n \"It will always be like this,\" Entreri said to his companion a short while later.\n \"It had not been so for Drizzt Do\u0027Urden of late, so my spies indicated,\" the drow answered. \"His reputation, in those lands where he was known, outshone the color of his skin in the eyes of even the small-minded men. So, soon, will my own.\"\n \"A reputation for heroic deeds?\" Entreri asked with a doubting laugh. \"Are you to become a hero for the land, then?\" \"That, or a reputation for leaving burned-out villages behind me,\" Jarlaxle replied. \"Either way, I care little.\"\n That brought a smile to Entreri\u0027s face, and he dared to hope then that he and his companion would get along famously.\n Kimmuriel and Rai-guy stared at the mirror enchanted for divining, watching the procession of nearly a score of ratmen, all in their human guise, trotting into the village.\n \"It is already tense,\" Kimmuriel observed. \"If Gord Abrix plays correctly, the townsfolk will join with him against Entreri and Jarlaxle. Thirty-to-two. Fine odds.\"\n Rai-guy gave a derisive snort. \"Strong enough odds, perhaps, so that Jarlaxle and Entreri will be a bit weary before we go in to finish the task,\" he said.\n Kimmuriel looked to his friend but, thinking about it, merely shrugged and grinned. He wasn\u0027t about to mourn the loss of Gord Abrix and a bunch of flea-infested wererats.\n \"If they do get in and get lucky,\" Kimmuriel remarked, \"we must be quick. The Crystal Shard is in there.\"\n \"Crenshinibon is not calling to Gord Abrix and his fools,\" Rai-guy replied, his dark eyes gleaming with anticipation. \"It is calling to me, even now. It knows we are close and knows how much greater it will be when I am the wielder.\"\n Kimmuriel said nothing, but studied his friend intently, suspecting that if Rai-guy achieved his goal, he and Crenshinibon would likely soon be at odds with Kimmuriel.\n \"How many does the tiny village hold?\" Jarlaxle asked when the tavern doors opened and a group of men walked in.\n Entreri started to answer flippantly, but held the thought and scrutinized the new group a bit more closely. \"Not that many,\" he answered, shaking his head.\n Jarlaxle followed the assassin\u0027s lead, studying the movements of the new arrivals, studying their weapons- swords mostly, and more ornate than anything the villagers were carrying.\n Entreri\u0027s head snapped to the side as he noted other forms moving about the two small windows. He knew then, beyond any doubt.\n These are not villagers, Jarlaxle silently agreed, using the intricate sign language of the dark elves, but moving his fingers much more slowly than normal in deference to Entreri\u0027s rudimentary understanding of the form.\n \"Ratmen,\" the assassin whispered in reply.\n \"You hear the shard calling to them?\"\n \"I smell them,\" Entreri corrected. He paused a moment to consider whether the Crystal Shard might indeed be calling out to the group, a beacon for his enemies, but he just dismissed the thought, for it hardly mattered.\n \"Sewage on their shoes,\" Jarlaxle noted.\n \"Vermin in their blood,\" the assassin spat. He got up from his seat and took a step out from the table. \"Let us begone,\" he said to Jarlaxle, loudly enough for the closest of the dozen ratmen who had entered the tavern to hear.\n Entreri took a step toward the door, and a second, aware that all eyes were upon him and his flamboyant companion, who was just then rising from his seat. Entreri took a third step, then... he leaped to the side, driving his dagger into the heart of the closest ratman before it could begin to draw its sword.\n \"Murderers!\" someone yelled, but Entreri hardly heard, leaping forward and drawing forth Charon\u0027s Claw.\n Metal rang out loudly as he brutally parried the swinging sword of the next closest wererat, hitting the blade so hard that he sent it flying out wide. A quick reversal sent Entreri\u0027s sword slashing out to catch the ratman across the face, and it fell back, clutching its torn eyes.\n Entreri had no time to pursue, for all the place was in motion then. A trio of ratmen, swords slashing the air before them, were closing fast. He waved Charon\u0027s Claw, creating a wall of ash, and leaped to the side, rolling under a table. The ratmen reacted, turning to pursue, but by the time they had their bearings, Entreri came up hard, bringing the table with him, launching it into their faces. Now he cut down low, taking a pair out at the knees, the fine blade cleanly severing one leg and nearly a second.\n Ratmen bore down on him, but a rain of daggers came whipping past the assassin, driving them back.\n Entreri waved his sword wildly, making a long and wavy vision-blocking wall. He managed a glance back at his companion to see Jarlaxle\u0027s arm furiously pumping, sending dagger after dagger soaring at an enemy. One group of ratmen, though, hoisted a table, as had Entreri, and used it as a shield. Several daggers thumped into it, catching fast. Bolstered by the impromptu shield, the group charged hard at the drow.\n Too occupied suddenly with more enemies of his own, including a couple of townsfolk, Entreri turned his attention back to his own situation. He brought his sword up parallel to the floor, intercepting the blade of one villager and lifting it high. Entreri started to tilt the blade point up, the expected parry, which would bring the man\u0027s sword out wide. As the farmer pushed back against the block, Entreri fooled him by bringing up the hilt instead, turning the blade down and forcing the man\u0027s sword across his body. Faster than the man could react with any backhand move, Entreri snapped his hand, his weapon\u0027s skull-capped pommel, into the man\u0027s face, laying him low.\n Back across came Charon\u0027s Claw, a mighty cut to intercept the sword of another, a ratman, and to slide through the parry and take the tip from another farmer\u0027s pitchfork. The assassin followed powerfully, stepping into his two foes, his sword working hard and furiously against the ratman\u0027s blade, driving it back, back, and to the side, forcing openings.\n The jeweled dagger worked fast as well, with Entreri making circular motions over the broken pitchfork shaft, turning it one way and another and keeping the inexperienced farmer stumbling forward and off his balance. He would have been an easy kill, but Entreri had other ideas.\n \"Do you not understand the nature of your new allies?\" he cried at the man, and as he spoke, he worked his sword even harder, slapping the blade against the wererat\u0027s sword to bat it slightly out of angle, and slapping the flat of the blade against the wererat\u0027s head. He didn\u0027t want to kill the creature, just to tempt the anger out of it. Again and again, the assassin\u0027s sword slapped at the wererat, bruising, taunting, stinging.\n Entreri noted the creature\u0027s twitch and knew what was coming.\n He drove the wererat back with a sudden but shortened stab, and went fully at the farmer, looping his dagger over and around the pitchfork, forcing it down at an angle. He went in one step toward the farmer, drove the wooden shaft down farther, forcing the man at an awkward angle that had him leaning on the assassin. Entreri broke away suddenly.\n The farmer stumbled forward helplessly and Entreri had him in a lock, looping his sword arm around the man and turning him as he came on so that he was then facing the twitching, changing wererat.\n The man gave a slight gasp, thinking his life was at its end, but caught fully in Entreri\u0027s grasp, a dagger at his back but not plunging in, he calmed enough to take in the spectacle.\n His scream at the horrid transformation, as the wererat\u0027s face broke apart, twisted and wrenched, reforming into the head of a giant rodent, rent the air and brought all attention to the sight.\n Entreri shoved the farmer toward the wrenching, changing ratman. To his satisfaction, he saw the farmer drive the broken pitchfork shaft through the beast\u0027s gut.\n Entreri spun away with many more enemies still to fight. The farmers were standing perplexed, not knowing which side to take. The assassin knew enough about the shape-changers to understand that he had started a chain reaction here, that the enraged and excited wererats would look upon their transformed kin and likewise revert to their more primal form.\n He took a moment to glance Jarlaxle\u0027s way then and saw the drow up in the air, levitating and turning circles, daggers flying from his pumping arm. Following their paths, Entreri saw one wererat, and another, stumble backward under the assault. A farmer grabbed at his calf, a blade deeply embedded there.\n Jarlaxle purposely hadn\u0027t killed the human, Entreri noted, though he surely could have.\n Entreri winced suddenly as a barrage of missiles soared back up at Jarlaxle, but the drow anticipated it and let go his levitation, dropping lightly and gracefully to the floor. He drew out two daggers as a host of opponents rushed in at him, grabbing them from hidden scabbards on his belt and not his enchanted bracer in a cross-armed maneuver. As he brought his arms back to their respective sides, Jarlaxle snapped his wrists and muttered something under his breath. The daggers elongated into fine, gleaming swords.\n The drow planted his feet wide and exploded into motion, his arms pumping, his swords cutting fast circles, over and under, at his sides, chopping the air with popping, whipping sounds. He brought one across his chest, then the next, spinning them wildly, then went up high with one, turning his hand to put the blade over his head and parallel with the floor.\n Entreri\u0027s expression soured. He had expected better of his drow companion. He had seen this fighting style many times, particularly among the pirates who frequented the seas off Calimport. It was called \"swashbuckling,\" a deceptive, and deceptively easy, fighting technique that was more show than substance. The swashbuckler relied on the hesitance and fear of his opponents to afford him opportunities for better strikes. While often effective against weaker opponents, Entreri found the style ridiculous against any of true talent. He had killed several swashbucklers in his day-two in one fight when they had inadvertently tied each other up with their whirling blades- and had never found them to be particularly challenging.\n The group of wererats coming in at Jarlaxle at that moment apparently didn\u0027t have much respect for the technique either. They quickly rushed around the drow, forming a box, and came in at him alternately, forcing him to turn, turn, and turn some more.\n Jarlaxle was more than up to the task, keeping his spinning swords in perfect harmony as he countered every testing thrust or charge.\n \"They will tire him,\" Entreri whispered under his breath as he worked away from his newest opponents. He was trying to pick a path that would bring him to his drow friend that he might get Jarlaxle out of his predicament. He glanced back at the drow then, hoping he might get there in time, but honestly wondering if the disappointing Jarlaxle was still worth the trouble.\n He gasped, first in confusion, and then in admiration.\n Jarlaxle did a sudden back flip, twisting as he somersaulted so that he landed facing the opponent who had been at his back. The wererat stumbled away, hit twice by shortened stabs-shortened because Jarlaxle had other targets in mind.\n The drow rolled around, falling into a crouch, and exploded out of it with a devastating double thrust at the wererat opposite. The creature leaped back, throwing its hips behind it and slapping its blade down in a desperate parry.\n Before he could even think about it, Entreri cried out, thinking his friend doomed, for one sword-wielding wererat charged from Jarlaxle\u0027s direct left, another from behind and to the right, leaving the drow no room to skitter away.\n \"They reveal themselves,\" Kimmuriel said with a laugh. He, Rai-guy, and Berg\u0027inyon watched the action through a dimensional portal that in effect put them in the thick of the fighting.\n Berg\u0027inyon thought the spectacle of the changing wererats equally amusing. He leaped forward, then, catching one farmer who was inadvertently stumbling through the portal, stabbing the man once in the side, and shoving him back through and to the tavern floor.\n More forms rushed by, more cries came in at them, with Kimmuriel and Berg\u0027inyon watching attentively and Rai-guy behind them, his eyes closed as he prepared his spells-a process that was taking the drow wizard longer because of the continuing, eager call of the imprisoned Crystal Shard.\n Gord Abrix flashed by the door.\n \"Catch him!\" Kimmuriel cried, and the agile Berg\u0027inyon leaped through the doorway, grabbed Gord Abrix in a debilitating lock, and dived back through with the wererat in tow. He kept Gord Abrix held firmly out of the way, the wererat crying protests at Kimmuriel.\n But the drow psionicist wasn\u0027t listening, for he was focused fully on his wizard companion. His timing in closing the door had to be perfect.\n Jarlaxle didn\u0027t even try to get out of there, and Entreri realized, he had expected the attacks all along, had baited them.\n Down low, his left leg far in front of his right, both arms and blades fully extended before him, Jarlaxle somehow managed to reverse his grip, and in a sudden and perfectly balanced momentum shift, the drow came back up straight. His left arm and blade stabbed out to the left. The sword in his right hand was flipped over in his hand so that when Jarlaxle turned his fist down, the tip was facing behind him, cocking straight back.\n Both charging wererats halted suddenly, their chests ripped open by the perfect stabs.\n Jarlaxle retracted the blades, put them back into their respective spins, and turned left, the whirling blades drawing lines of bright blood all over the wounded wererat there, and completing the turn, slashing the wererat behind him repeatedly and finishing with a powerful crossing backhand maneuver that took the creature\u0027s head from its shoulders.\n Thus disintegrating Entreri\u0027s ideas about the weakness of the swashbuckling technique.\n The drow rushed past into the path of the first wererat he had struck, his spinning swords intercepting his opponent\u0027s, and bringing it into the spin with them. In a moment, all three blades were in the air, turning circles, and only two of them, Jarlaxle\u0027s, were still being held. The third was kept aloft by the slapping and sliding of the other two.\n Jarlaxle hooked the hilt of that sword with the blade of one of his own, angled it out to the side and launched it into the chest of another attacker, knocking him back and to the floor.\n He went ahead suddenly and brutally, blades whirling with perfect precision, to take the wererat\u0027s arm, then drop the other arm limply to its side with a well-placed blow to the collarbone, then slash its face, then its throat.\n Up came Jarlaxle\u0027s foot, planting against the staggered wererat\u0027s chest, and he kicked out, knocking the creature to its back and running over it.\n Entreri had meant to get to Jarlaxle\u0027s side, but instead, the drow came rushing up to Entreri\u0027s side, uttering a command under his breath that retracted one of his swords to dagger size. He quickly slid the weapon back to its sheath, and with his free hand grabbed Entreri by the shoulder and pulled him along.\n The puzzled assassin glanced at his companion. More wererats were piling into the tavern, through the windows, through the door, but those remaining farmers were falling back now, moving into purely defensive positions. Though more than a dozen wererats remained, Entreri did not believe that he and this amazingly skilled drow warrior would have any trouble at all tearing them apart.\n Furthermore and even more puzzling, Jarlaxle had their run angled for the closest wall. While putting a solid barrier at their backs might be effective in some cases against so many opponents, Entreri thought this ridiculous, given Jarlaxle\u0027s flamboyant, room-requiring style.\n Jarlaxle let go of Entreri then and reached up to the top of his huge hat.\n From somewhere unseen in the strange hat, he brought forth a black disk made of some fabric Entreri did not know and sent it spinning at the wall. It elongated as it went, turning flat side to the wooden wall, then it hit... and stuck.\n And it was no longer a disk of fabric, but rather a hole-a real hole-in the wall.\n Jarlaxle pushed Entreri through, dived through right behind him, and paused only long enough to pull the magical hole out behind him, leaving the wall solid once more.\n \"Run!\" the dark elf cried, sprinting away, with Entreri right on his heels.\n Before Entreri could even ask what the drow knew that he did not, the building exploded into a huge and consuming fireball that took the tavern, took all of those wererats still scrambling about the entrances and exits, and took the horses, including Entreri\u0027s and Jarlaxle\u0027s, tethered anywhere near to the place.\n The pair went flying to the ground but got right back up, running full speed out of the village and back into the shadows of the surrounding hills and woodlands.\n They didn\u0027t even speak for many, many minutes, just ran on, until Jarlaxle finally pulled up behind one bluff and fell against the grassy hill, huffing and puffing. \"I had grown fond of my mount,\" he said. \"A pity.\" \"I did not see the spellcaster,\" Entreri remarked. \"He was not in the room,\" Jarlaxle explained, \"not physically, at least.\"\n \"Then how did you sense him?\" Entreri started to ask, but he paused and considered the logic that had led Jarlaxle to his saving conclusion. \"Because Kimmuriel and Rai-guy would never take the chance that Gord Abrix and his cronies would get the Crystal Shard,\" he reasoned. \"Nor would they ever expect the wretched wererats ever to be able to take the thing from us in the first place.\"\n \"I have already explained to you that it is a common tactic for the two,\" Jarlaxle reminded. \"They send their fodder in to engage their enemies, and Kimmuriel opens a window through which Rai-guy throws his potent magic.\"\n Entreri looked back in the direction of the village, at the plume of black smoke drifting into the air. \"Well thought,\" he congratulated. \"You saved us both.\"\n \"Well, you at least,\" Jarlaxle replied, and Entreri looked back at him curiously, to see the drow waggling the fingers of one hand against his cheek, showing off a reddish-gold ring that Entreri had not noticed before.\n \"It was just a fireball,\" Jarlaxle said with a grin.\n Entreri nodded and returned that grin, wondering if there was anything, anything at all, that Jarlaxle was not prepared for. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/servant-of-the-shard-paths-of-darkness-3/page-20.html","bookId":2138,"book":{"id":2138,"title":"Servant of the Shard (Paths of Darkness #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Servant of the Shard (Paths of Darkness #3) \n With each kill, I grow wiser, and with added wisdom, I grow stronger.
