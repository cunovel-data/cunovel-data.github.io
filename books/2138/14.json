{"id":95378,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"FLIPPING THE HOURGLASS\n You understand your role in every contingency?\" Entreri asked Dwahvel at their next meeting, an impromptu affair conducted in the alley beside the Copper Ante, an area equally protected from divining wizards by Dwahvel\u0027s potent anti-spying resources.\n \"In every contingency that you have outlined,\" the halfling replied with a warning smirk.\n \"Then you understand every contingency,\" Entreri answered without hesitation. He returned her grin with one of complete confidence.\n \"You have thought every possibility through?\" the halfling asked doubtfully. \"These are dark elves, the masters of manipulation and intrigue, the makers of the layers of their own reality and of the rules within that layered reality.\"\n \"And they are not in their homeland and do not understand the nuances of Calimport,\" Entreri assured her. \"They view the whole world as an extension of Menzoberranzan, an extension in temperament, and more importantly, in how they measure the reactions of those around them. I am iblith, thus inferior, and thus, they will not expect the turn their version of reality is about to take.\"\n \"The time has come?\" Dwahvel asked, still doubtfully. \"Or are you bringing the critical moment upon us?\"\n \"I have never been a patient man,\" Entreri admitted, and his wicked grin did not dissipate with the admission but intensified.\n \"Every contingency,\" Dwahvel remarked, \"thus every layer of the reality you intend to create. Beware, my competent friend, that you do not get lost somewhere in the mixture of your realities.\"\n Entreri started to scowl but held back the negative thoughts, recognizing that Dwahvel was offering him sensible advice here, that he was playing a most dangerous game with the most dangerous foes he had ever known. Even in the best of circumstances, Artemis Entreri realized that his success, and therefore his very life, would hang on the movements of a split second and would be forfeited by the slightest turn of bad luck. This culminating scenario was not the precision strike of the trained assassin but the desperate move of a cornered man.\n Still, when he looked at his halfling friend, Entreri\u0027s confidence and resolve were bolstered. He knew that Dwahvel would not disappoint him hi this, that she would hold up her end of the reality-making process.\n \"If you succeed, I\u0027ll not see you again,\" the halfling remarked. \"And if you fail, I\u0027ll likely not be able to find your blasted and torn corpse.\"\n Entreri took the blunt words for the offering of affection that he knew they truly were. His smile was wide and genuine-so rare a thing for the assassin.\n \"You will see me again,\" he told Dwahvel. \"The drow will grow weary of Calimport and will recede back to their sunless holes where they truly belong. Perhaps it will happen in months, perhaps in years, but they will eventually go. That is their nature. Rai-guy and Kimmuriel understand that there is no long-term benefit for them or for Bregan D\u0027aerthe in expanding any trading business on the surface. Discovery would mean all-out war. That is the main focus of their ire with Jarlaxle, after all. So they will go, but you will remain, and I will return.\"\n \"Even if the drow do not kill you now, am I to believe that your road will be any less dangerous once you\u0027re gone?\" the halfling asked with a snort that ended in a grin. \"Is there any such road for Artemis Entreri? Not likely, I say. Indeed, with your new weapon and that defensive gauntlet, you will likely take on the assassinations of prominent wizards as your chosen profession. And, of course, eventually one of those wizards will understand the truth of your new toys and their limitations, and he will leave you a charred and smoking husk.\" She chuckled and shook her head. \"Yes, go after Khelben, Vangerdahast, or Elminster himself. At least your death will be painlessly quick.\"\n \"I did say I was not a patient man,\" Entreri agreed.\n To his surprise, and to the halfling\u0027s as well, Dwahvel then rushed up to him and leaped upon him, wrapping him in a hug. She broke free quickly and backed away, composing herself.\n \"For luck and nothing more,\" she said. \"Of course I prefer your victory to that of the dark elves.\"\n \"If only the dark elves,\" Entreri said, needing to keep this conversation lighthearted.\n He knew what awaited him. It would be a brutal test of his skills-of all of his skills-and of his nerve. He walked the very edge of disaster. Again, he reminded himself that he could indeed count on the reliability of one Dwahvel Tiggerwillies, that most competent of halflings. He looked at her hard then and understood that she was going to play along with his last remark, was not going to give him the satisfaction of disagreeing, of admitting that she considered him a friend.\n Artemis Entreri would have been disappointed in her if she had.\n \"Beware that you do not catch yourself within the very layers of lies that you have perpetrated,\" Dwahvel said after the assassin as he started away, already beginning to blend seamlessly into the shadows.\n Entreri took those words to heart. The potential combinations of the possible events was indeed staggering. Improvisation alone might keep him alive in this critical time, and Entreri had survived the entirety of his life on the very edge of disaster. He had been forced to rely on his wits, on complete improvisation, dozens of times, scores of times, and had somehow managed to survive. In his mind, he held contingency plans to counter every foreseeable event. While he kept confidence in himself and in those he had placed strategically around him, he did not for one moment dismiss the fact that if one eventuality materialized that he had not counted on, if one wrong turn appeared before him and he could not find a way around that bend, he would die.\n And, given the demeanor of Rai-guy, he would die horribly.\n The street was busy, as were most of the avenues in Calimport, but the most remarkable person on it seemed the most unremarkable. Artemis Entreri, wearing the guise of a beggar, kept to the shadows, not moving suspiciously from one to another, but blending invisibly against the backdrop of the bustling street.\n His movements were not without purpose. He kept his prey in sight at every moment.\n Sharlotta Vespers attempted no such anonymity as she moved along the thoroughfare. She was the recognized figurehead of House Basadoni, walking bidden into the domain of dangerous Pasha Da\u0027Daclan. Many suspicious, even hateful eyes cast more than the occasional glance her way, but none would move against her. She had requested the meeting with Da\u0027Daclan, on orders from Rai-guy, and had been accepted under his protection. Thus, she walked now with the guise of complete confidence, bordering on bravado.\n She didn\u0027t seem to realize that one of those watching her, shadowing her, was not under any orders from Pasha Da\u0027Daclan.\n Entreri knew this area well, for he had worked for the Rakers on several occasions in the past. Sharlotta\u0027s demeanor told him without doubt that she was coming for a formal parlay. Soon enough, as she passed one potential meeting area after another, he was able to deduce exactly where that meeting would take place. What he did not know, however, was how important this meeting might be to Rai-guy and Kimmuriel.\n \"Are you watching her every step with your strange mind powers, Kimmuriel? \u0027 he asked quietly\n His mind worked through the contingency plans he had to keep available should that be the case. He didn\u0027t believe that the two drow, busy with planning of their own, no doubt, would be monitoring Sharlotta\u0027s every move, but it was certainly possible. If that came to pass, Entreri realized that he would know it, in no uncertain terms, very soon. He could only hope that he\u0027d be ready and able to properly adjust his course.\n He moved more quickly then, outpacing the woman by taking the side alleys, even climbing to one roof, and scrambling across to another and to another.\n Soon after, he reached the house bordering the alley he believed Sharlotta would turn down, a suspicion only heightened by the fact that a sentry was in position on that very roof, overlooking the alley on the far side.\n As silent as death, Entreri moved into position behind the sentry, with the man\u0027s attention obviously focused on the alleyway and completely oblivious to him. Working carefully, for he knew that others would be about, Entreri spent some amount of time casing the entire area, locating the two sentries on the rooftops across the way and one other on this side of the alley, on the adjoining roof of a building immediately behind the one Entreri now stood upon.\n He watched those three more than the man directly in front of him, measured their every movement, their every turn of the head. Most of all, he gauged their focus. Finally, when he was certain that they were not attentive, the assassin struck, yanking his victim back behind a dormer.\n A moment later, all four of Pasha Da\u0027Daclan\u0027s sentries seemed in place once more, all of them honestly intent on the alleyway below as Sharlotta Vespers, a pair of Da\u0027Daclan\u0027s guards at her back, turned into the alleyway.\n Entreri\u0027s thoughts whirled. Five enemy soldiers, and a supposed comrade who seemed more of an enemy than the others. He didn\u0027t delude himself into thinking that these five were alone. Da\u0027Daclan\u0027s stooges probably included a significant portion of the scores of people milling about on the main avenue.\n Entreri went anyway, rolling over the edge of the roof of the two-story building, catching hold with his hand, stretching to his limit, and dropping agilely to the surprised Sharlotta\u0027s side.\n \"A trap,\" he whispered harshly, and he turned to face the two soldiers following her and held up his hand for them to halt. \"Kimmuriel has a dimensional portal in place for our escape on the roof.\"\n Sharlotta\u0027s facial expression went from surprise to anger to calm so quickly, each one buried in her practiced manner, that only Entreri caught the range of expressions. He knew that he had her befuddled, that his mention of Kimmuriel had given credence to his outlandish claim that this was a trap.\n \"I will take her from here,\" Entreri said to the guards. He heard movement farther along and across the alley, as two of the other three sentries, including the one on the same side of the alley as Entreri, came down to see what was going on.\n \"Who are you?\" one of the soldiers following Sharlotta asked skeptically, his hand going inside his common traveling cloak to the hilt of a finely crafted sword. \"Go,\" Entreri whispered to Sharlotta. The woman hesitated, so Entreri prompted her retreat in no uncertain terms. Out came the jeweled dagger and Charon\u0027s Claw, the assassin throwing back his cloak, revealing himself in all his splendor. He leaped forward, slashing with his sword and thrusting with his dagger at the second soldier.\n Out came the swords in response. One picked off the swipe of Charon\u0027s Claw, but with the man inevitably retreating as he parried. That had been Entreri\u0027s primary goal. The second soldier, though, had less fortune. As his sword came forth to parry, Entreri gave a subtle twist of his wrist and looped his dagger over the blade, then thrust it home into the man\u0027s belly.\n With others closing fast, the assassin couldn\u0027t follow through with the kill, but he did hold the strike long enough to bring forth the dagger\u0027s life-stealing energies to let the man know the purest horror he could ever imagine. The soldier wasn\u0027t really badly wounded, but he fell away to the ground, clutching his belly and howling in terror.\n The assassin broke back, turning away from the wall where Sharlotta Vespers was scrambling to gain the roof.\n The one who had fallen back from the sword slash came at Entreri from the left. Another came from the right, and two rushed across the alleyway, coming straight in. Entreri started right, sword leading, then turned back fast to the left. Even as the four began to compensate for the change-a change that was not completely unexpected-the assassin turned back fast to the right, charging in hard just as that soldier had begun to accelerate in pursuit.\n The soldier found himself in a flurry of slashing and stabbing. He worked his own blades, a sword and dirk, quite well. The soldier was no novice to battle, but this was Artemis Entreri. Whenever the man moved to parry, Entreri altered the angle. His fury kept the ring of metal in the air for a long few seconds, but the dagger slipped through, gashing the soldier\u0027s right arm. As that limb drooped, Entreri went into a spin, Charon\u0027s Claw coming around fast to pick off a thrust from the man coming in at his back, then continuing through, over the wounded man\u0027s lowered defense, slashing him hard across the chest.\n Also on that maneuver, Entreri\u0027s devilish sword trailed out the black ash wall. The line was horizontal, not vertical, so that ash did not impede the vision of his adversaries, but still the mere sight of it hanging there in midair gave them enough pause for Entreri to dispatch the man who had come in on his right. Then the assassin went into a wild flurry, sword waving and bringing up an opaque wall.\n The remaining three soldiers settled back behind it, confused and trying to put some coordination into their movements. When at last they mustered the nerve to charge through the ash wall, they discovered that the assassin was nowhere to be found.\n Entreri watched them from the rooftop, shaking his head at their ineptness, and also at the little values offered by this wondrous sword-a weapon to which he was growing more fond with each battle.\n \"Where is it?\" Sharlotta called to him from across the way.\n Entreri looked at her quizzically.\n \"The doorway?\" Sharlotta asked. \"Where is it?\"\n \"Perhaps Da\u0027Daclan has interfered,\" Entreri replied, trying to hide his satisfaction that apparently Rai-guy and Kimmuriel were not closely monitoring Sharlotta\u0027s movements. \"Or perhaps they decided to leave us,\" he added, figuring that if he could throw a bit of doubt into Sharlotta Vespers\u0027 view of the world and her dark-elven compatriots, then so be it.\n Sharlotta merely scowled at that disturbing thought.\n Noise from behind told them that the soldiers in the alleyway weren\u0027t giving up and reminded them that they were on hostile territory here. Entreri ran past Sharlotta, motioning for her to follow, then made the leap across the next alleyway to another building, then to a third, then down and out the back end of an alley, and finally, down into the sewers-a place that Entreri wasn\u0027t thrilled about entering at that time, given his recent assassination of Domo. He didn\u0027t remain underground for long, coming up in the more familiar territory beyond Da\u0027Daclan\u0027s territory and closer to the Basadoni guild house.\n Still leading, Entreri made his way along at a swift pace until he reached the alleyway beside the Copper Ante, where he abruptly stopped.\n Seeming more angry than grateful, obviously doubting the sincerity of the escape and the very need for it, Sharlotta continued past, hardly glancing his way.\n Until the assassin\u0027s sword came out and settled in front of her neck. \"I think not,\" he remarked.\n Sharlotta glanced sidelong at him, and he motioned for her to head down the alley beside Dwahvel\u0027s establishment.\n \"What is this?\" the woman asked.\n \"Your only chance at continuing to draw breath,\"\n Entreri replied. When she still didn\u0027t move, he grabbed her by the arm, and with frightening strength yanked her in front of him heading down the alley. He pointedly reminded her to keep going, prodding her with his sword.\n They came to a tiny room, having entered through a secret alley entrance. The room held a single chair, into which Entreri none-too-gently shoved Sharlotta.\n \"Have you lost what little sense you once possessed?\" the woman asked.\n \"Am I the one bargaining secret deals with dark elves?\" Entreri replied, and the look Sharlotta gave him in the instant before she found her control told him volumes about the truth of his suspicions.\n \"We have both been dealing as need be,\" the woman indignantly answered.\n \"Dealing? Or double-dealing? There is a difference, even with dark elves.\"\n \"You speak the part of a fool,\" snapped Sharlotta. \"Yet you are the one closer to death, \"Entreri reminded, and he came in very close, now with his jeweled dagger in hand, and a look on his face that told Sharlotta that he was certainly not bluffing here. Sharlotta knew well the life-stealing powers of that horrible dagger. \"Why were you going to meet with Pasha Da\u0027Daclan?\" Entreri asked bluntly.\n \"The change at Dallabad has raised suspicions,\" the woman answered, an honest and obvious-if obviously incomplete-response.\n \"No suspicions that trouble Jarlaxle, apparently,\" Entreri reasoned.\n \"But some that could turn to serious trouble,\" Sharlotta went on, and Entreri knew that she was improvising here. \"I was to meet with Pasha Da\u0027Daclan to assure him the situation on the streets, and elsewhere, will calm to normal.\" \"That any expansion by House Basadoni is at its end?\" Entreri asked doubtfully. \"Would you not be lying, though, and would that not invite even greater wrath when the next conquest falls before Jarlaxle?\" \"The next?\"\n \"Have you come to believe that our suddenly ambitious leader means to stop?\" Entreri asked.\n Sharlotta spent a long while mulling that one over. \"I have been told that House Basadoni will begin pulling back, to all appearances, at least,\" she said. \"As long as we encounter no further outside influences.\"\n \"Like the spies at Dallabad,\" Entreri agreed. Sharlotta nodded-a bit too eagerly, Entreri thought. \"Then Jarlaxle\u0027s hunger is at last sated, and we can get back to a quieter and safer routine,\" the assassin remarked.\n Sharlotta did not respond.\n Entreri\u0027s lips curled up into a smile. He knew the truth of it, of course, that Sharlotta had just blatantly lied to him. He would never have put it past Jarlaxle to have played such opposing games with his underlings in days past, leading Entreri in one direction and Sharlotta in another, but he knew that the mercenary leader was in the throes of Crenshinibon\u0027s hunger now, and given the information supplied by Dwahvel, he understood the truth of that. It was a truth very different from the lie Sharlotta had just outlined.\n Sharlotta, by going to Da\u0027Daclan and claiming that Jarlaxle had been behind the meeting, which meant that Rai- guy and Kimmuriel certainly had been, confirmed to Entreri that time was indeed running short.\n He stepped back and paused, digesting all of the information, trying to reason when and where the actual infighting might occur. He noted, too, that Sharlotta was watching him very carefully.\n Sharlotta moved with the grace and speed of a hunting cat, rolling off the chair to one knee, drawing and throwing a dagger at Entreri\u0027s heart, and bolting for the room\u0027s other, less remarkable doorway.\n Entreri caught the dagger in midflight, turned it over in his hand and hurled it into that door with a thump, to stick, quivering, before Sharlotta\u0027s widening eyes.\n He grabbed her and turned her roughly around, hitting her with a heavy punch across the face.\n She drew out another dagger-or tried to. Entreri caught her wrist even as it came out of its concealed sheath, turning a quick spin under the arm and tugging so violently that all of Sharlotta\u0027s strength left her hand and the dagger fell harmlessly to the floor. Entreri tugged again, and let go. He leaped around in front of the woman, slapping her twice across the face, and grabbed her hard by the shoulders. He ran her backward, to crash back into the chair.\n \"Do you not even understand those with whom you play these foolish games?\" he growled in her face. \"They will use you to their advantage, and discard you. In their eyes you are iblith, a word that means \"not drow,\" a word that also means offal. Those two, Rai-guy and Kimmuriel, are the greatest racists among Jarlaxle\u0027s lieutenants. You will find no gain beside them, Sharlotta the Fool, only horrible death.\"\n \"And what of Jarlaxle?\" she cried out in response.\n It was just the sort of instinctive, emotional explosion the assassin had been counting on. There it was, as clear as it could be, an admission that Sharlotta had fallen into league with two would-be kings of Bregan D\u0027aerthe. He moved back from her, just a bit, leaving her ruffled in the chair.\n \"I offer you one chance,\" he said to her. \"Not out of any favorable feelings I might hold toward you, because there are none, but because you have something I need.\"\n Sharlotta straightened her shirt and tunic and tried to regain some of her dignity.\n \"Tell me everything,\" Entreri said bluntly. \"All of this coup-when, where, and how. I know more than you believe, so try none of your foolish games with me.\"\n Sharlotta smirked at him doubtfully. \"You know nothing,\" she replied. \"If you did, you\u0027d know you\u0027ve come to play the role of the idiot.\"\n Even as the last word left her mouth, Entreri was there, back against her, one hand roughly grabbing her hair and yanking her head back, the other, holding his awful dagger point in at her exposed throat. \"Last chance,\" he said, so very calmly. \"And do remember that I do not like you, dearest Sharlotta.\"\n The woman swallowed hard, her eyes locked onto Entreri\u0027s deadly gaze.\n Entreri\u0027s reputation heightened the threat reflected in his eyes to the point where Sharlotta, with nothing to lose and no reason for loyalty to the dark elves, spilled all she knew of the entire plan, even the method Rai-guy and Kimmuriel planned to use to incapacitate the Crystal Shard- some kind of mind magic transformed into a lantern.\n None of it came as any surprise to Entreri, of course. Still, hearing the words spoken openly did bring a shock to him, a reminder of how precarious his position truly had become. He quietly muttered his litany of creating his own reality within the strands of the layered web and reminded himself repeatedly that he was every bit the player as were his two opponents.\n He moved away from Sharlotta to the inner door. He pulled free the stuck dagger and banged hard three times on the door. It opened a few moments later and a very surprised looking Dwahvel Tiggerwillies bounded into the room.\n \"Why have you come?\" she started to ask of Entreri, but she stopped, her gaze caught by the ruffled Sharlotta. Again she turned to Entreri, this time her expression one of surprise and anger. \"What have you done?\" the halfling demanded of the assassin. \"I\u0027ll play no part in any of the rivalries within House Basadoni!\"\n \"You will do as you are instructed,\" the assassin replied coldly. \"You will keep Sharlotta here as your comfortable but solitary guest until I return to permit her release.\"\n \"Permit?\" Dwahvel asked doubtfully, turning from Entreri to Sharlotta. \"What insanity have you brought upon me, fool?\"\n \"The next insult will cost you your tongue,\" Entreri said coldly, perfectly playing the role. \"You will do as I\u0027ve instructed. Nothing more, nothing less. When this is finished, even Sharlotta will thank you for keeping her safe in times when none of us truly are.\"\n Dwahvel stared hard at Sharlotta as Entreri spoke, making silent contact. The human woman gave the slightest nod of her head.\n Dwahvel turned back to the assassin. \"Out,\" she ordered.\n Entreri looked to the alleyway door, so perfectly fitted that it was barely an outline on the wall.\n \"Not that way... it opens only in,\" Dwahvel said sourly, and she pointed to the conventional door. \"That way.\" She moved up to him and pushed him along, out of the room, turning to close and lock the door behind them.\n \"It has come this far already?\" Dwahvel asked when the two were safely down the corridor.\n Entreri nodded grimly.\n \"But you are still on course for your plan?\" Dwahvel asked. \"Despite this unexpected turn?\"\n Entreri\u0027s smile reminded the halfling that nothing would be, or could be, unexpected.\n Dwahvel nodded. \"Logical improvisation,\" she remarked.\n \"You know your role,\" Entreri replied.\n \"And I thought I played it quite well,\" Dwahvel said with a smile.\n \"Too well,\" Entreri said to her as they reached another doorway farther along the wall up the alleyway. \"I was not joking when I said I would take your tongue.\"\n With that, he went out into the alley, leaving a shaken Dwahvel behind. After a moment, though, the halfling merely chuckled, doubting that Entreri would ever take her tongue, whatever insults she might throw his way.\n Doubting, but not sure-never sure. That was the way of Artemis Entreri.\n Entreri was out of the city before dawn, riding hard for Dallabad Oasis on a horse he\u0027d borrowed without the owner\u0027s permission. He knew the road well. It was often congested with beggars and highwaymen. That knowledge didn\u0027t stop the assassin, though, didn\u0027t slow his swift ride one bit. When the sun rose over his left shoulder he only increased his pace, knowing that he had to get to Dallabad on time.\n He\u0027d told Dwahvel that Jarlaxle was back at the crystalline tower, where the assassin now had to go with all haste. Entreri knew the halfling would be prompt about her end of the plan. Once she released Sharlotta....\n Entreri put his head down and drove on in the growing morning sunlight. He was still miles away, but he could see the sharp focus at the top of the tower... no, towers, he realized, for he saw not one, but two pillars rising in the distance to meet the morning light.\n He didn\u0027t know what that meant, of course, but he didn\u0027t worry about it. Jarlaxle was there, according to his many sources-informants independent of, and beyond the reach of Rai-guy and Kimmuriel and their many lackeys.\n He sensed the scrying soon after and knew he was being watched. That only made the desperate assassin put his head down and drive the stolen horse on at greater speeds, determined to beat the brutal, self-imposed timetable.\n \"He goes to Jarlaxle with great haste, and we know not where Sharlotta Vespers has gone,\" Kimmuriel remarked to Rai-guy.\n The two of them, along with Berg\u0027inyon Baenre, watched the assassin\u0027s hard ride out from Calimport.\n \"Sharlotta may remain with Pasha Da\u0027Daclan,\" Rai-guy replied. \"We cannot know for certain.\"\n \"Then we should learn,\" said an obviously frustrated and nervous Kimmuriel.\n Rai-guy looked at him. \"Easy, my friend,\" he said. \"Artemis Entreri is no threat to us but merely a nuisance. Better that all of the vermin gather together.\"\n \"A more complete and swift victory,\" Berg\u0027inyon agreed.\n Kimmuriel thought about it and held up a small square lantern, three sides shielded, the fourth open.\n Yharaskrik had given it to him with the assurance that, when Kimmuriel lit the candle and allowed its glow to fall over Crenshinibon, the powers of the Crystal Shard would be stunted. The effects would be temporary, the illithid had warned. Even confident Yharaskrik held no illusions that anything would hold the powerful artifact at bay for long.\n But it wouldn\u0027t take long, Kimmuriel and the others knew, even if Artemis Entreri was at Jarlaxle\u0027s side. With the artifact shut down, Jarlaxle\u0027s fall would be swift and complete, as would the fall of all of those, Entreri included, who stood beside him.\n This day would be sweet indeed-or rather, this night. Rai-guy and Kimmuriel had planned to strike at night, when the powers of the Crystal Shard were at their weakest.\n \"He is a fool, but one, I believe, acting on honest fears,\" Dwahvel Tiggerwillies said to Sharlotta when she joined the woman in the small room. \"Find a bit of sympathy for him, I beg.\"\n Sharlotta, the prisoner, looked at the halfling incredulously.\n \"Oh, he\u0027s gone now,\" said Dwahvel, \"and so should you be.\"\n \"I thought I was your prisoner,\" the woman asked.\n Dwahvel chuckled. \"Forever and ever?\" she asked with obvious sarcasm. \"Artemis Entreri is afraid, and so you should be too. I know little about dark elves, I admit, but-\"\n \"Dark elves?\" Sharlotta echoed, feigning surprise and ignorance. \"What has any of this to do with dark elves?\"\n Dwahvel laughed again. \"The word is out,\" she said, \"about Dallabad and House Basadoni. The power behind the throne is well-known around the streets.\"\n Sharlotta started to mumble something about Entreri, but Dwahvel cut her short. \"Entreri told me nothing,\" she explained. \"Do you think I would need to deal with one as powerful as Entreri for such common information? I am many things, but I do not number fool among them.\"\n The woman settled back in her chair, staring hard at the halfling. \"You believe you know more than you really know,\" she said. \"That is a dangerous mistake.\"\n \"I know only that I want no part of any of this,\" Dwahvel returned. \"No part of House Basadoni or of Dallabad Oasis. No part of the feud between Sharlotta Vespers and Artemis Entreri.\"\n \"It would seem that you are already a part of that feud,\" the woman replied, her sparkling dark eyes narrowing.\n Dwahvel shook her head. \"I did and do as I had to do, nothing more,\" she said.\n \"Then I am free to leave?\"\n Dwahvel nodded and stood aside, leaving the path to the door open. \"I came back here as soon as I was certain Entreri was long gone. Forgive me, Sharlotta, but I would not make of you an ally if doing so made Entreri an enemy.\"\n Sharlotta continued to stare hard at the surprising halfling, but she couldn\u0027t argue with the logic of that statement. \"Where has he gone?\" she asked.\n \"Out of Calimport, my sources relay,\" Dwahvel answered. \"To Dallabad, perhaps? Or long past the oasis- all the way along the road and out of Calimshan. I believe I might take that very route, were I Artemis Entreri.\"\n Sharlotta didn\u0027t reply, but silently she agreed wholeheartedly. She was still confused by the recent events, but she recognized clearly that Entreri\u0027s supposed \"rescue\" of her was no more than a kidnapping of his own, so he could squeeze information out of her. And she had offered much, she understood to her apprehension. She had told him more than she should have, more than Rai-guy and Kimmuriel would likely find acceptable.\n She left the Copper Ante trying to sort it all out. What she did know was that the dark elves would find her and likely soon. The woman nodded, recognizing the only real course left open before her, and started off with all speed for House Basadoni. She would tell Rai-guy and Kimmuriel of Entreri\u0027s treachery.\n Entreri looked at the sun hanging low in the eastern sky and took a deep, steadying breath. The time had passed. Dwahvel had released Sharlotta, as arranged. The woman, no doubt, had run right to Rai-guy and Kimmuriel, thus setting into motion momentous events.\n If the two dark elves were even still in Calimport.\n If Sharlotta had not figured out the ruse within the kidnapping, and had gone off the other way, running for cover.\n If the dark elves hadn\u0027t long ago found Sharlotta in the Copper Ante and leveled the place, in which case, Dallabad and the Crystal Shard might already be in Rai-guy\u0027s dangerous hands.\n If, in learning of the discovery, Rai-guy and Kimmuriel hadn\u0027t just turned around and run back to Menzoberranzan.\n If Jarlaxle still remained at Dallabad.\n That last notion worried Entreri profoundly. The unpredictable Jarlaxle was, perhaps, the most volatile on a long list of unknowns. If Jarlaxle had left Dallabad, what trouble might he bring to every aspect of this plan? Would Kimmuriel and Rai-guy catch up to him unawares and slay him easily?\n The assassin shook all of the doubts away. He wasn\u0027t used to feelings of self-doubt, even inadequacy. Perhaps that was why he so hated the dark elves. In Menzoberranzan, the ultimately capable Artemis Entreri had felt tiny indeed.\n Reality is what you make of it, he reminded himself He was the one weaving the layers of intrigue and deception here, so he-not Rai-guy and Kimmuriel, not Sharlotta, not even Jarlaxle and the Crystal Shard-was the one in command.\n He looked at the sun again, and glanced to the side, to the imposing structures of the twin crystalline towers set among the palms of Dallabad, reminding himself that this time he, and no one else, had turned over that hourglass.\n Reminding himself pointedly that the sand was running, that time was growing short, he kicked his horse\u0027s flanks and leaped away, galloping hard to the oasis. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/servant-of-the-shard-paths-of-darkness-3/page-14.html","bookId":2138,"book":{"id":2138,"title":"Servant of the Shard (Paths of Darkness #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Servant of the Shard (Paths of Darkness #3) \n With each kill, I grow wiser, and with added wisdom, I grow stronger.
