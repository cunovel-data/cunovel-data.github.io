{"id":95367,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"LIFE IN THE DARK LANE\\n\\n Faster! Faster, I say!\" Jarlaxle howled. His arm flashed repeatedly, and a seemingly endless stream of daggers spewed forth at the dodging and rolling assassin.\\n\\n Entreri worked his jeweled dagger and his sword-a drow- fashioned blade that he was not particularly enamored of- furiously, with in and out vertical rolls to catch the missiles and flip them aside. All the while he kept his feet moving, skittering about, looking for an opening in Jarlaxle\u0027s superb defensive posture-a stance made all the more powerful by the constant stream of spinning daggers.\\n\\n \"An opening!\" the drow mercenary cried, letting fly one, two, three more daggers.\\n\\n Entreri sent his sword back the other way but knew that his opponent\u0027s assessment was correct. He dived into a roll instead, tucking his head and his arms in tight to cover any vital areas.\\n\\n \"Oh, well done!\" Jarlaxle congratulated as Entreri came to his feet after taking only a single hit, and that a dagger sticking into the trailing fold of his cloak instead of his skin.\\n\\n Entreri felt the dagger swing in against the back of his leg as he stood up. Fearing that it might trip him, he tossed his own dagger into the air, then quickly pulled the cloak from his shoulders, and in the same fluid movement, started to toss it aside.\\n\\n An idea came to him, though, and he didn\u0027t discard the cloak but rather caught his deadly dagger and set it between his teeth. He stalked a semicircle about the drow, waving his cloak, a drow piwafwi, slowly about as a shield against the missiles.\\n\\n Jarlaxle smiled at him. \"Improvisation,\" he said with obvious admiration. \u0027The mark of a true warrior.\" Even as he finished, though, the drow\u0027s arm starting moving yet again. A quartet of daggers soared at the assassin.\\n\\n Entreri bobbed and spun a complete circuit, but tossed his cloak as he did and caught it as he came back around. One dagger skidded across the floor, another passed over Entreri\u0027s head, narrowly missing, and the other two got caught in the fabric, along with the previous one.\\n\\n Entreri continued to wave the cloak, but it wasn\u0027t flowing wide anymore, weighted as it was by the three daggers. \"Not so good a shield, perhaps,\" Jarlaxle commented. \"You talk better than you fight,\" Entreri countered. \"A bad combination.\"\\n\\n \"I talk because I so enjoy the fight, my quick friend,\" Jarlaxle replied.\\n\\n His arm went back again, but Entreri was already moving. The human held his arm out wide to keep the cloak from tripping him, and dived into a roll right toward the mercenary, closing the gap between them in the blink of an eye.\\n\\n Jarlaxle did let fly one dagger. It skipped off Entreri\u0027s back, but the drow mercenary caught the next one sliding out of his magical bracer into his hand and snapped his wrist, speaking a command word. The dagger responded at once, elongating into a sword. As Entreri came over, his sword predictably angled up to gut Jarlaxle, the drow had the parry in place.\\n\\n Entreri stayed low and skittered forward instead, swinging his cloak in a roundabout manner to wrap it behind Jarlaxle\u0027s legs. The mercenary quick-stepped and almost got out of the way, but one of the daggers hooked his boot and he fell over backward. Jarlaxle was as agile as any drow, but so too was Entreri. The human came up over the drow, sword thrusting.\\n\\n Jarlaxle parried fast, his blade slapping against Entreri\u0027s. To the drow\u0027s surprise, the assassin\u0027s sword went flying away. Jarlaxle understood soon enough, though, for Entreri\u0027s now free hand came forward, clasping Jarlaxle\u0027s forearm and holding the drow\u0027s weapon out wide.\\n\\n And there loomed the assassin\u0027s other hand, holding again that deadly jeweled dagger.\\n\\n Entreri had the opening and had the strike, and Jarlaxle couldn\u0027t block it or begin to move away from it. A wave of such despair, an overwhelming barrage of complete and utter hopelessness, washed over Entreri. He felt as if someone had just entered his brain and began scattering all of his thoughts, starting and stopping all of his reflexes. In the inevitable pause, Jarlaxle brought his other arm forward, launching a dagger that smacked Entreri in the gut and bounced away.\\n\\n The barrage of discordant, paralyzing emotions continued to blast away in Entreri\u0027s mind, and he stumbled back. He hardly felt the motion and was somewhat confused a moment later, as the fuzziness began to clear, to find that he was on the other side of the small room sitting against the wall and facing a smiling Jarlaxle.\\n\\n Entreri closed his eyes and at last forced the confusing jumble of thoughts completely away. He assumed that Rai-guy, the drow wizard who had imbued both Entreri and Jarlaxle with stoneskin spells that they could spar with all of their hearts without fear of injuring each other, had intervened. When he glanced that way, he saw that the wizard was nowhere to be seen. He turned back to Jarlaxle, guessing then that the mercenary had used yet another in his seemingly endless bag of tricks. Perhaps he had used his newest magical acquisition, the powerful Crenshinibon, to overwhelm Entreri\u0027s concentration.\\n\\n \"Perhaps you are slowing down, my friend,\" Jarlaxle remarked. \"What a pity that would be. It is good that you defeated your avowed enemy when you did, for Drizzt Do\u0027Urden has many centuries of youthful speed left in him.\"\\n\\n Entreri scoffed at the words, though in truth, the thought gnawed at him. He had lived his entire life on the very edge of perfection and preparedness. Even now, in the middle years of his life, he was confident that he could defeat almost any foe-with pure skill or by out-thinking any enemy, by properly preparing any battlefield-but Entreri didn\u0027t want to slow down. He didn\u0027t want to lose that edge of fighting brilliance that had so marked his life.\\n\\n He wanted to deny Jarlaxle\u0027s words, but he could not, for he knew in his heart that he had truly lost that fight with Drizzt, that if Kimmuriel Oblodra had not intervened with his psionic powers, then Drizzt would have been declared the victor.\\n\\n \"You did not outmatch me with speed,\" the assassin started to argue, shaking his head.\\n\\n Jarlaxle came forward, his glowing eyes narrowing dangerously-a threatening expression, a look of rage, that the assassin rarely saw upon the handsome face of the always-in-control dark elf mercenary leader.\\n\\n \"I have this!\" Jarlaxle announced, pulling wide his cloak and showing Entreri the tip of the artifact, Crenshinibon, the Crystal Shard, tucked neatly into one pocket. \"Never forget that. Without it, I could likely still defeat you, though you are good, my friend-better than any human I have ever known. But with this in my possession... you are but a mere mortal. Joined in Crenshinibon, I can destroy you with but a thought. Never forget that.\"\\n\\n Entreri lowered his gaze, digesting the words and the tone, sharpening that image of the uncharacteristic expression on Jarlaxle\u0027s always smiling face. Joined in Crenshinibon?... but a mere mortal? What in the Nine Hells did that mean? Never forget that, Jarlaxle had said, and indeed, this was a lesson that Artemis Entreri would not soon dismiss.\\n\\n When he looked back up again, Entreri saw Jarlaxle wearing his typical expression, that sly, slightly amused look that conferred to all who saw it that this cunning drow knew more than he did, knew more than he possibly could.\\n\\n Seeing Jarlaxle relaxed again also reminded Entreri of the novelty of these sparring events. The mercenary leader would not spar with any other. Rai-guy was stunned when Jarlaxle had told him that he meant to battle Entreri on a regular basis.\\n\\n Entreri understood the logic behind that thinking. Jarlaxle survived, in part, by remaining mysterious, even to those around him. No one could ever really get a good look at the mercenary leader. He kept allies and opponents alike off-balance and wondering, always wondering, and yet, here he was, revealing so much to Artemis Entreri.\\n\\n \"Those daggers,\" Entreri said, coming back at ease and putting on his own sly expression. \"They were merely illusions.\"\\n\\n \"In your mind, perhaps,\" the dark elf replied in his typically cryptic manner.\\n\\n \"They were,\" the assassin pressed. \"You could not possibly carry so many, nor could any magic create them that quickly.\"\\n\\n \"As you say,\" Jarlaxle replied. \"Though you heard the clang as your own weapons connected with them and felt the weight as they punctured your cloak.\"\\n\\n \"I thought I heard the clang,\" Entreri corrected, wondering if he had at last found a chink in the mercenary\u0027s never-ending guessing game.\\n\\n \"Is that not the same thing?\" Jarlaxle replied with a laugh, but it seemed to Entreri as if there was a darker side to that chuckle.\\n\\n Entreri lifted that cloak, to see several of the daggers- solid metal daggers-still sticking in its fabric folds, and to find several more holes in the cloth. \"Some were illusions, then,\" he argued unconvincingly.\\n\\n Jarlaxle merely shrugged, never willing to give anything away.\\n\\n With an exasperated sigh, Entreri started out of the room.\\n\\n \"Do keep ever present in your thoughts, my friend, that an illusion can kill you if you believe in it,\" Jarlaxle called after him.\\n\\n Entreri paused and glanced back, his expression grim. He wasn\u0027t used to being so openly warned or threatened, but he knew that with this one particular companion, the threats were never, ever idle.\\n\\n \"And the real thing can kill you whether you believe in it or not,\" Entreri replied, and he turned back for the door.\\n\\n The assassin departed with a shake of his head, frustrated and yet intrigued. That was always the way with Jarlaxle, Entreri mused, and what surprised him even more was that he found that aspect of the clever drow mercenary particularly compelling.\\n\\n That is the one, Kimmuriel Oblodra signaled to his two companions, Rai-guy and Berg\u0027inyon Baenre, the most recent addition to the surface army of Bregan D\u0027aerthe.\\n\\n The favored son of the most powerful house in Menzoberranzan, Berg\u0027inyon had grown up with all the drow world open before him-to the level that a drow male in Menzoberranzan could achieve, at least-but his mother, the powerful Matron Baenre, had led a disastrous assault on a dwarven kingdom, ending in her death and throwing all the great drow city into utter chaos. In that time of ultimate confusion and apprehension, Berg\u0027inyon had thrown his hand in with Jarlaxle and the ever elusive mercenary band of Bregan D\u0027aerthe. Among the finest of fighters in all the city, and with familial connections to still-mighty House Baenre, Berg\u0027inyon was welcomed openly and quickly promoted, elevated to the status of high lieutenant. Thus, he was not here now serving Rai-guy and Kimmuriel, but as their peer, taken out on a sort of training mission.\\n\\n He considered the human Kimmuriel had targeted, a shapely woman posing in the dress of a common street whore.\\n\\n You have read her thoughts\u0027? Rai-guy signaled back, his fingers weaving an intricate pattern, perfectly complementing the various expressions and contortions of his handsome and angular drow features.\\n\\n Raker spy, Kimmuriel silently assured his companion. The coordinator of their group. All pass her by, reporting their finds.\\n\\n Berg\u0027inyon shifted nervously from foot to foot, uncomfortable around the revelations of the strange and strangely powerful Kimmuriel. He hoped that Kimmuriel wasn\u0027t reading his thoughts at that moment, for he was wondering how Jarlaxle could ever feel safe with this one about. Kimmuriel could walk into someone\u0027s mind, it seemed, as easily as Berg\u0027inyon could walk through an open doorway. He chuckled then but disguised it as a cough, when he considered that clever Jarlaxle likely had that doorway somehow trapped. Berg\u0027inyon decided that he\u0027d have to learn the technique, if there was one, to keep Kimmuriel at bay.\\n\\n Do we know where the others might be? Berg\u0027inyon\u0027s hands silently asked.\\n\\n Would the show be complete if we did not? came Rat-guy\u0027s responding gestures. The wizard smiled widely, and soon all three of the dark elves wore sly, hungry expressions.\\n\\n Kimmuriel closed his eyes and steadied himself with long, slow breaths.\\n\\n Rai-guy took the cue, pulling an eyelash encased in a bit of gum arabic out of one of his several belt pouches. He turned to Berg\u0027inyon and began waggling his fingers. The drow warrior flinched reflexively-as most sane people would do when a drow wizard began casting in their direction.\\n\\n The first spell went off, and Berg\u0027inyon, rendered invisible, faded from view. Rai-guy went right back to work, now aiming a spell designed mentally to grab at the target, to hold the spy fast.\\n\\n The woman flinched and seemed to hold for a second, but shook out of it and glanced around nervously, now obviously on her guard.\\n\\n Rai-guy growled and went at the spell again. Invisible Berg\u0027inyon stared at him with an almost mocking smile- yes, there were advantages to being invisible! Rai-guy continually demeaned humans, called them every drow name for offal and carrion. On the one hand, he was obviously surprised that this one had resisted the hold spell-no easy mental task-but on the other, Berg\u0027inyon noted, the blustery wizard had prepared more than one of the spells. One, without any resistance, should have been enough.\\n\\n This time, the woman took one step, and held fast in her walking pose.\\n\\n Go! Kimmuriel\u0027s fingers waved. Even as he gestured, the powers of his mind opened the doorway between the three drow and the woman. Suddenly she was there, though she was still on the street, but only a couple of strides away. Berg\u0027inyon leaped out and grabbed the woman, tugging her hard into the extra-dimensional space, and Kimmuriel shut the door.\\n\\n It had happened so fast that to any watching on the street, it would have seemed as if the woman had simply disappeared.\\n\\n The psionicist raised his delicate black hand up to the victim\u0027s forehead, melding with her mentally. He could feel the horror in there, for though her physical body had been locked in Rai-guy\u0027s stasis, her mind was working and she knew indeed that she now stood before dark elves.\\n\\n Kimmuriel took just a moment to bask in that terror, thoroughly enjoying the spectacle. Then he imparted psionic energies to her. He built around her an armor of absorbing kinetic energy, using a technique he had perfected in Entreri\u0027s battle with Drizzt Do\u0027Urden.\\n\\n When it was done, he nodded.\\n\\n Berg\u0027inyon became visible again almost immediately, as his fine drow sword slashed across the woman\u0027s throat, the offensive strike dispelling the defensive magic of Rai-guy\u0027s invisibility spell. The drow warrior went into a fast dance, slashing and thrusting with both of his fine swords, stabbing hard, even chopping once with both blades, a heavy drop down onto the woman\u0027s head.\\n\\n But no blood spewed forth, no groans of pain came from the woman, for Kimmuriel\u0027s armor accepted each blow, catching and holding the tremendous energy offered by the drow warrior\u0027s brutal dance.\\n\\n It went on and on for several minutes, until Rai-guy warned that the spell of holding was nearing its end. Berg\u0027inyon backed away, and Kimmuriel closed his eyes again as Rai-guy began yet another casting.\\n\\n Both onlookers, Kimmuriel and Berg\u0027inyon, smiled wickedly as Rai-guy produced a tiny ball of bat guano that held a sulfuric aroma and shoved it, along with his finger into the woman\u0027s mouth, releasing his spell. A flash of fiery light appeared in the back of the woman\u0027s mouth, disappearing as it slid down her throat.\\n\\n The sidewalk was there again, very close, as Kimmuriel opened a second dimension portal to the same spot on the street, and Rai-guy roughly shoved the woman back out.\\n\\n Kimmuriel shut the door, and they watched, amused.\\n\\n The hold spell released first, and the woman staggered. She tried to call out, but coughed roughly from the burn in her throat. A strange expression came over her, one of absolute horror.\\n\\n She feels the energy contained in the kinetic barrier, Kimmuriel explained. I hold it no longer-only her own will prevents its release.\\n\\n How long? a concerned Rai-guy asked, but Kimmuriel only smiled and motioned for them to watch and enjoy.\\n\\n The woman broke into a run. The three drow noted other people moving about her, some closing cautiously- other spies, likely-and others seeming merely curious. Still others grew alarmed and tried to stay away from her.\\n\\n All the while, she tried to scream out, but just kept hacking from the continuing burn in her throat. Her eyes were wide, so horrifyingly and satisfyingly wide! She could feel the tremendous energies within her, begging release, and she had no idea how she might accomplish that.\\n\\n She couldn\u0027t hold the kinetic barrier, and her initial realization of the problem transformed from horror into confusion. All of Berg\u0027inyon\u0027s terrible beating came out then, so suddenly. All of the slashes and the stabs, the great chop and the twisting heart thrust, burst over the helpless woman. To those watching, it seemed almost as if she simply fell apart, gallons of blood erupting about her face, head, and chest.\\n\\n She went down almost immediately, but before anyone could even begin to react, could run away or charge to her aid, Rai-guy\u0027s last spell, a delayed fireball, went off, immolating the already dead woman and many of those around her.\\n\\n Outside the blast, wide-eyed stares came at the charred corpse from comrade and ignorant onlooker alike, expressions of the sheerest terror that surely pleased the three merciless dark elves.\\n\\n A fine display. Worthy indeed.\\n\\n For Berg\u0027inyon, the spectacle served a second purpose, a clear reminder to him to take care around these fellow lieutenants himself. Even taking into consideration the high drow standards for torture and murder, these two were particularly adept, true masters of the craft. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/servant-of-the-shard-paths-of-darkness-3/page-3.html","bookId":2138,"book":{"id":2138,"title":"Servant of the Shard (Paths of Darkness #3)","description":"Storyline: Servant of the Shard (Paths of Darkness #3) \\n With each kill, I grow wiser, and with added wisdom, I grow stronger.
