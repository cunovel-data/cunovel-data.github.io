{"id":95374,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"CONTROL AND COOPERATION The Copper Ante was fairly busy this evening, with halflings mostly crowding around tables, rolling bones or playing other games of chance and all whispering about the recent events in and around the city. Every one of them spoke quietly, though, for among the few humans in the tavern that night were two rather striking figures, operatives central to the recent tumultuous events. Sharlotta Vespers was very aware of the many stares directed her way, and she knew that many of these halflings were secret allies of her companion this night. She had almost refused Entreri\u0027s invitation for her to come and meet with him privately here, in the house of Dwahvel Tiggerwillies, but she recognized the value of the place. The Copper Ante was beyond the prying eyes of Rai-guy and Kimmuriel, a condition necessary, so Entreri had said, for any meeting. \"I can\u0027t believe you openly walk Calimport\u0027s streets with that sword,\" Sharlotta remarked quietly. \"It is rather distinctive,\" Entreri admitted, but there wasn\u0027t the slightest hint of alarm in his voice. \"It\u0027s a well-known blade,\" Sharlotta answered. \"Anyone who knew of Kohrin Soulez and Dallabad knows he would never willingly part with it, yet here you are, showing it to all who would glance your way. One might think that a clear connection between the downfall of Dallabad and House Basadoni.\" \"How so?\" Entreri asked, and he took pleasure indeed at the look of sheer exasperation that washed over Sharlotta. \"Kohrin is dead and Artemis Entreri is wearing his sword,\" Sharlotta remarked dryly. \"He is dead, and thus the sword is no longer of any use to him,\" Entreri flippantly remarked. \"On the streets, it is understood that he was killed in a coup by his very own daughter, who, by all rumors, had no desire to be captured by Charon\u0027s Claw as was Kohrin.\" \"Thus it falls to the hands of Artemis Entreri?\" Sharlotta asked incredulously. \"It has been hinted that Kohrin\u0027s refusal to sell at the offered price-an absurd amount of gold-was the very catalyst for the coup,\" Entreri went on, leaning back comfortably in his chair. \"When Ahdahnia learned that he refused the transaction....\" \"Impossible,\" Sharlotta breathed, shaking her head. \"Do you really expect that tale to be believed?\" Entreri smiled wryly. \"The words of Sha\u0027lazzi Ozoule are often believed,\" he remarked. \"Inquiries to purchase the sword were made through Sha\u0027lazzi only days before the coup at Dallabad.\" That set Sharlotta back in her chair as she tried hard to digest and sort through all of the information. On the streets, it was indeed being said that Kohrin had been killed in a coup-Jarlaxle\u0027s domination of the remaining Dallabad forces through use of the Crystal Shard had provided consistency in all of the reports coming out of the oasis. As long as Crenshinibon\u0027s dominance held out, there was no evidence at all to reveal the truth of the assault on Dallabad. If Entreri had spoken truly-and Sharlotta had no reason to think that he had not-the refusal by Kohrin to sell Charon\u0027s Claw would be linked not to any theft or any attack by House Basadoni, but rather as one of the catalysts for the coup. Sharlotta stared hard at Entreri, her expression a mixture of anger and admiration. He had covered every possible aspect of his procurement of the coveted sword beforehand. Sharlotta, given her understanding of Entreri\u0027s relationship with the dangerous Rai-guy and Kimmuriel, held no doubts that Entreri had helped guide the dark elves to Dallabad specifically with the intent of collecting that very sword. \"You weave a web with many layers,\" the woman remarked. \"I have been around dark elves for far too long,\" Entreri casually replied. \"But you walk the very edge of disaster,\" said Sharlotta. \"Many of the guilds had already linked the downfall of Dallabad with House Basadoni, and now you openly parade about with Charon\u0027s Claw. The other rumors are plausible, of course, but your actions do little to distance us from the assassination of Kohrin Soulez.\" \"Where stands Pasha Da\u0027Daclan or Pasha Wroning?\" Entreri asked, feigning concern. \"Da\u0027Daclan is cautious and making no overt moves,\" Sharlotta replied. Entreri held his grin private at her earnest tones, for she had obviously taken his bait. \"He is far from pleased with the situation, though, and the strong inferences concerning Dallabad.\" \"As they all will be,\" Entreri reasoned. \"Unless Jarlaxle grows too bold with his construction of crystalline towers.\" Again he spoke with dramatically serious tones, more to measure Sharlotta\u0027s reaction than to convey any information the woman didn\u0027t already know. He did note a slight tremor in her lip. Frustration? Fear? Disgust? Entreri knew that Rai-guy and Kimmuriel were not happy with Jarlaxle, and that the two independent-minded lieutenants, perhaps, were thinking that the influences of the sentient and dominating Crystal Shard might be causing some serious problems. They had sent him after Morik to weaken the guild\u0027s presence on the surface, obviously, but why, then, was Sharlotta still alive? Had she thrown in with the two potential usurpers to Bregan D\u0027aerthe\u0027s dark throne? \"The deed is completed now and cannot be undone,\" Entreri remarked. \"Indeed I did desire Charon\u0027s Claw-what warrior would not? - but with Sha\u0027lazzi Ozoule spreading his tales of a generous offer to buy being refused by Kohrin, and with Ahdahnia Soulez speaking openly of her disdain for her father\u0027s choices, particularly concerning the sword, it all plays to the advantage of Bregan D\u0027aerthe and our work here. Jarlaxle needed a haven to construct the tower, and we gave him one. Bregan D\u0027aerthe now has eyes beyond the city, where we might watch all mounting threats that are outside of our immediate jurisdiction. Everyone wins.\" \"And Entreri gets the sword,\" Sharlotta remarked. \"Everyone wins,\" the assassin said again. \"Until we step too far, and too boldly, and all the world unites against us,\" said Sharlotta. \"Jarlaxle has lived on such a precipice for centuries,\" Entreri replied. \"He has not stumbled over yet.\" Sharlotta started to respond but held her words at the last moment. Entreri knew them anyway, words taken from her by the quick give and take of the conversation, the mounting excitement and momentum bringing a rare unguarded moment. She was about to remark that never in all those centuries had Jarlaxle possessed Crenshinibon, the clear inference being that never in those centuries had Crenshinibon possessed Jarlaxle. \"Say nothing of our concerns to Rai-guy and Kimmuriel,\" Entreri bade her. \"They are fearful enough, and frightened creatures, even drow, can make serious errors. You and I will watch from afar-perhaps there is a way out of this if it comes to an internal war.\" Sharlotta nodded, and rightly took Entreri\u0027s tone as a dismissal. She rose, nodded again, and moved out of the room. Entreri didn\u0027t believe that nod for a moment. He knew the woman would likely go running right to Rai-guy and Kimmuriel, attempting to bend this conversation her way. But that was the point of it all, was it not? Entreri had just forced Sharlotta\u0027s hand, forced her to show her true alliances in this ever-widening web of intrigue. Certainly his last claim, that there might be a way out for the two of them, would ring hollow to Sharlotta, who knew him well, and knew well that he would never bother to take her along with him on any escape from Bregan D\u0027aerthe. He\u0027d put a dagger in her back as surely as he had killed any previous supposed partners, from Tallan Belmer to Rassiter the wererat. Sharlotta knew that, and Entreri knew she knew it. It did occur to the assassin that perhaps Sharlotta, Rai-guy, and Kimmuriel were correct in their apparent assessment that Crenshinibon was having unfavorable influences on Jarlaxle, that the artifact was leading the cunning mercenary in a direction that could spell doom for Bregan D\u0027aerthe\u0027s surface ambitions. That hardly mattered to Entreri, of course, who wasn\u0027t sure the retreat of the dark elves back to Menzoberranzan would be such a bad thing. What was more important, to Entreri\u0027s thinking, were the dynamics of his relationship with the principles of the mercenary band. Rai-guy and Kimmuriel were notorious racists and hated him as they hated anyone who was not drow-more, even, because Entreri\u0027s skill and survival instincts threatened them profoundly. Without Jarlaxle\u0027s protection, it wasn\u0027t hard for Artemis Entreri to envision his fate. While he felt somewhat bolstered by his acquisition of Charon\u0027s Claw, the bane of wizards, he hardly thought it evened the odds in any battle he might find with the duo of the drow wizard-cleric and psionicist. If those two wound up in command of Bregan D\u0027aerthe, with over a hundred drow warriors at their immediate disposal... Entreri didn\u0027t like the odds at all. He knew, without doubt, that Jarlaxle\u0027s fall would almost immediately precede his own. Kimmuriel walked along the tunnels beneath Dallabad with some measure of trepidation. This was a haszakkin, after all, an illithid-unpredictable and deadly. Still, the drow had come alone, had deceived Rai-guy that he might do so. There were some things that psionicists alone could understand and appreciate. Around a sudden bend in the tunnel, Kimmuriel came upon the bulbous-headed creature, sitting calmly on a rock against the back end of an alcove. Yharaskrik\u0027s eyes were closed, but he was awake, Kimmuriel knew, for he could feel the mental energy beaming out from the creature. I chose well in siding with Bregan D\u0027aerthe, it would seem, the illithid telepathically remarked. There was never any doubt. The drow are stronger than the humans, Kimmuriel agreed, using the illithid\u0027s telepathic link to impart his exact thoughts. Stronger than these humans, Yharaskrik corrected. Kimmuriel bowed, figuring to let the matter drop there, but Yharaskrik had more to discuss. Stronger than Kohrin Soulez, the illithid went on. Crippled, he was, by his obsession with a particular magical item. That brought some understanding to Kimmuriel, some logical connection between the mind flayer and the pitiful gang of Dallabad Oasis. Why would a creature as great as Yharaskrik waste its time with such inferior beings, after all? You were sent to observe the powerful sword and the gauntlet, he reasoned. We wish to understand that which can sometimes defeat our attacks, Yharaskrik freely admitted. Yet neither item is without limitations. Neither is as powerful as Kohrin Soulez believed, or your attack would never have succeeded. We have discerned as much, Kimmuriel agreed. My time with Kohrin Soulez was nearing its end, said Yharaskrik, a clear inference that the illithid- creatures known as among the most meticulous of all in the multiverse- believed that it had learned every secret of the sword and gauntlet. The human, Artemis Entreri, confiscated both the gauntlet and Charon\u0027s Claw, the drow psionicist explained. That was his intent, of course, the illithid replied. He fears you and wisely so. You are strong in will, Kimmuriel of House Oblodra. The drow bowed again. Respect the sword named Charon\u0027s Claw, and even more so the gauntlet the human now wears on his hand. With these, he can turn your powers back against you if you are not careful. Kimmuriel imparted his assurances that Artemis Entreri and his dangerous new weapon would be closely watched. Are your days of watching the paired items now ended? he asked as he finished. Perhaps, Yharaskrik answered. Or perhaps Bregan D\u0027aerthe could find a place suited to your special talents, Kimmuriel offered. He didn\u0027t think it would be hard to persuade Jarlaxle of such an arrangement. Dark elves often allied with illithids in the Underdark. Yharaskrik\u0027s pause was telling to the perceptive and intelligent drow. \"You have a better offer?\" Kimmuriel asked aloud, and with a chuckle. Better it would be if I remained to the side of events, unknown to Bregan D\u0027aerthe other than to Kimmuriel Oblodra, Yharaskrik answered in all seriousness. The response at first confused Kimmuriel and made him think that the illithid feared that Bregan D\u0027aerthe would side with Entreri and Charon\u0027s Claw if any such conflict arose between Yharaskrik and Entreri, but before he could begin to offer his assurances against that, the illithid imparted a clear image to him, one of a crystalline tower shining in the sun above the palm trees of Dallabad Oasis. The towers?\" Kimmuriel asked aloud. They are just manifestations of Crenshinibon.\" Crenshinibon. The word came to Kimmuriel with a sense of urgency and great importance. It is an artifact, the drow telepathically explained. A new toy for Jarlaxle\u0027s collection. Not so, came Yharaskrik\u0027s response. Much more than that, I fear, as should you. Kimmuriel narrowed his red-glowing eyes, focusing carefully on Yharaskrik\u0027s thoughts, which he expected might confirm the fears he and Rai-guy had long been discussing. Weave into the thoughts of Jarlaxle, I cannot, the illithid went on. He wears a protective item. The eye patch, Kimmuriel silently replied. It denies entrance to his mind by wizard, priest, or psionicist. But such a simple tool cannot defeat the encroachment of Crenshinibon, Yharaskrik explained. How do you know of the artifact? Crenshinibon is no mystery to my people, for it is an ancient item indeed, and one that has crossed the trails of the illithids on many occasions, Yharaskrik admitted. Indeed, Crenshinibon, the Crystal Shard, despises us, for we alone are quite beyond its tempting reach. We alone as a great race are possessed of the mental discipline necessary to prevent the Crystal Shard from its greatest desires of absolute control. You, too, Kimmuriel, can step beyond the orb of Crenshinibon\u0027s influence and easily. The drow took a long moment to contemplate the implications of that claim, but naturally, he quickly came to the conclusion that Yharaskrik was relating that psionics alone might fend the intrusions of the Crystal Shard, since Jarlaxle\u0027s potent eye patch was based in wizardly magic and not the potent powers of the mind. Crenshinibon\u0027s primary attack is upon the ego, the illithid explained. It collects slaves with promises of greatness and riches. Not unlike the drow, Kimmuriel related, thinking of the tactics Bregan D\u0027aerthe had used on Morik. Yharaskrik laughed a gurgling, bubbly sound. The more ambitious the wielder, the easier he will be controlled. But what if the wielder is ambitious yet ultimately cautious? Kimmuriel asked, for never had he known Jarlaxle to allow his ambition to overrule good judgment-never before, at least, for only recently had he, Rai-guy, and others come to question the wisdom of the mercenary leader\u0027s decisions. Some lessers can deny the call, the illithid admitted, and it was obvious to Kimmuriel that Yharaskrik considered anyone who was not illithid or who was not at least a psionicist a lesser. Crenshinibon has little sway over paladins and goodly priests, over righteous kings and noble peasants, but one who desires more-and who of the lesser races, drow included, does not? - and who is not above deception and destruction to further his ends, will inevitably sink into Crenshinibon\u0027s grasp. It made perfect sense to Kimmuriel, of course, and explained why Drizzt Do\u0027Urden and his \"heroic\" friends had seemingly put the artifact away. It also explained Jarlaxle\u0027s recent behavior, confirming Kimmuriel\u0027s suspicions that Bregan D\u0027aerthe was indeed being led astray. I would not normally refuse an offer of Bregan D\u0027aerthe, Yharaskrik imparted a moment later, after Kimmuriel had digested the information. You and your reputable kin would be amusing at the least-and likely enlightening and profitable as well-but I fear that all of Bregan D\u0027aerthe will soon fall under the domination of Crenshinibon. And why would Yharaskrik fear such a thing, if Crenshinibon becomes leader in order to take us in the same ambitious direction that we have always pursued? Kimmuriel asked, and he feared that he already knew the answer. I trust not the drow, Yharaskrik admitted, but I understand enough of your desires and methods to recognize that we need not be enemies among the cattle humans. I trust you not, but I fear you not, because you would find no gain in facilitating my demise. Indeed, you understand that I am connected to the one community that is my people, and that if you killed me you would be making many powerful enemies. Kimmuriel bowed, acknowledging the truth of the illithid\u0027s observations. Crenshinibon, however, Yharaskrik went on, acts not with such rationality. It is all-devouring, a scourge upon the world, controlling all that it can and consuming that which it cannot. It is the bane of devils, yet the love of demons, a denier of laws for the sake of the destruction wrought by chaos. Your Lady Lolth would idolize such an artifact and truly enjoy the chaos of its workings-except of course that Crenshinibon, unlike her drow agents, works not for any ends, but merely to devour. Crenshinibon will bring great power to Bregan D\u0027aerthe-witness the new willing slaves it has made for you, among them the very daughter of the man you overthrew. In the end, Crenshinibon will abandon you, will bring upon you foes too great to fend. This is the history of the Crystal Shard, repeated time and again through the centuries. It is unbridled hunger without discipline, doomed to bloat and die. Kimmuriel unintentionally winced at the thoughts, for he could see that very path being woven right before the still- secretive doorstep of Bregan D\u0027aerthe. All-devouring, Yharaskrik said again. Controlling all that it can and consuming that which it cannot. And you are among that which it cannot, Kimmuriel reasoned. \"As are you,\" Yharaskrik said in its watery voice. \"Tower of Iron Will and Mind Blank,\" the illithid recited, two typical and readily available mental defense modes that psionicists often used in their battles with each other. Kimmuriel growled, understanding well the trap that the illithid had just laid for him, the alliance of necessity that Yharaskrik, obviously fearing that Kimmuriel might betray him to Jarlaxle and the Crystal Shard, had just forced upon him. He knew those defensive mental postures, of course, and if the Crystal Shard came after him, seeking control, now that he knew the two defenses would prevent the intrusions, he would inevitably and automatically summon them up. For, like any psionicist, like any reasoning being, Kimmuriel\u0027s ego and id would never allow such controlling possession. He stared long and hard at the illithid, hating the creature, and yet sympathizing with Yharaskrik\u0027s fears of Crenshinibon. Or, perhaps, it occurred to him that Yharaskrik had just saved him. Crenshinibon would have come after him, to dominate if not to destroy, and if Kimmuriel had discovered the correct ways to block the intrusion in time, then he would have suddenly become an enemy in an unfavorable position, as opposed to now, when he, and not Crenshinibon, properly understood the situation at hand. \"You will shadow us?\" he asked the illithid, hoping the answer would be yes. He felt a wave of thoughts roll through him, ambiguous and lacking any specifics, but indicating clearly that Yharaskrik meant to keep a watchful eye on the dangerous Crystal Shard. They were allies, then, out of necessity. \"I do not like her,\" came the high-pitched, excited voice of Dwahvel Tiggerwillies. The halfling shuffled over to take Sharlotta\u0027s vacated seat at Entreri\u0027s table. \"Is it her height and beauty that so offend you?\" Entreri sarcastically replied. Dwahvel shot him a perfectly incredulous look. \"Her dishonesty,\" the halfling explained. That answer raised Entreri\u0027s eyebrow. Wasn\u0027t everyone on the streets of Calimport, Entreri and Dwahvel included, basically a manipulator? If a claim of dishonesty was a reason not to like someone in Calimport, then the judgmental person would find herself quite alone. \"There is a difference,\" Dwahvel explained, intercepting a nearby waiter with a wave of her hand and taking a drink from his laden tray. \"So it comes back to that height and beauty problem, then,\" Entreri chided with a smile. His own words did indeed amuse him, but what caught his fancy even more was the realization that he could, and often did, talk to Dwahvel in such a manner. In all of his life, Artemis Entreri had known very few people with whom he could have a casual conversation, but he found himself so at ease with Dwahvel that he had even considered hiring a wizard to determine if she was using some charming magic on him. In fact, then and there, Entreri clenched his gloved fist, concentrating briefly on the item to see if he could determine any magical emanations coming from Dwahvel, aimed at him. There was nothing, only honest friendship, which to Artemis Entreri was a magic more foreign indeed. \"I have often been jealous of human women,\" Dwahvel answered sarcastically, doing well to keep a perfectly straight face. \"They are often tall enough to attract even ogres, after all.\" Entreri chuckled, an expression from him so rare that he actually surprised himself in hearing it. \"There is a difference between Sharlotta and many others, yourself included,\" Dwahvel went on. \"We all play the game-that is how we survive, after all-and we all deceive and plot, twisting truths and lies alike to reach our own desired ends. The confusion for some, Sharlotta included, lies in those ends. I understand you. I know your desires, your goals, and know that I impede those goals at my peril. But I trust as well that, as long as I do not impede those goals, I\u0027ll not find the wrong end of either of your fine blades.\" \"So thought Dondon,\" Entreri put in, referring to Dondon Tiggerwillies, Dwahvel\u0027s cousin and once Entreri\u0027s closest friend in the city. Entreri had murdered the pitiful Dondon soon after his return from his final battle with Drizzt Do\u0027Urden. \"Your actions against Dondon did not surprise him, I assure you,\" Dwahvel remarked. \"He was a good enough friend to you to have killed you if he had ever found you in the same situation as you found him. You did him a favor.\" Entreri shrugged, hardly sure of that, not even sure of his own motivations in killing Dondon. Had he done so to free Dondon from his own gluttonous ends, from the chains that kept him locked in a room and in a state of constant incapacity? Or had he killed Dondon simply because he was angry at the failed creature, simply because he could not stand to look at the miserable thing he had become any longer? \"Sharlotta is not trustworthy because you cannot understand her true goals and motivations,\" Dwahvel continued. \"She desires power, yes, as do many, but with her, one can never understand where she might be thinking that she can find that power. There is no loyalty there, even to those who maintain consistency of character and action. No, that one will take the better deal at the expense of any and all.\" Entreri nodded, not disagreeing in the least. He had never liked Sharlotta, and like Dwahvel, he had never even begun to trust her. There were no scruples or codes within Sharlotta Vespers, only blatant manipulation. \"She crosses the line every time,\" Dwahvel remarked. \"I have never been fond of women who use their bodies to get that which they desire. I\u0027ve got my own charms, you know, and yet I have never had to stoop to such a level.\" The lighthearted ending brought another smile to Entreri\u0027s face, and he knew that Dwahvel was only half joking. She did indeed have her charms: a pleasant appearance and fine, flattering dress, as sharp a wit as was to be found, and a keen sense of her surroundings. \"How are you getting on with your new companion?\" Dwahvel asked. Entreri looked at her curiously-she did have a way of bouncing about a conversation. \"The sword,\" Dwahvel clarified, feigning exasperation. \"You have it now, or it has you.\" \"I have it,\" Entreri assured her, dropping his hand to the bony hilt. Dwahvel eyed him suspiciously. \"I have not yet fought my battle with Charon\u0027s Claw,\" Entreri admitted to her, hardly believing that he was doing so, \"but I do not think it so powerful a weapon that I need fear it.\" \"As Jarlaxle believes with Crenshinibon?\" Dwahvel asked, and again, Entreri\u0027s eyebrow lifted high. \"He constructed a crystalline tower,\" the ever-observant halfling argued. \"That is one of the most basic desires of the Crystal Shard, if the old sages are to be believed.\" Entreri started to ask her how she could possibly know of any of that, of the shard and the tower at Dallabad and of any connection, but he didn\u0027t bother. Of course Dwahvel knew. She always knew-that was one of her charms. Entreri had dropped enough hints in their many discussions for her to figure it all out, and she did have an incredible number of other sources as well. If Dwahvel Tiggerwillies learned that Jarlaxle carried an artifact known as Crenshinibon, then there would be little doubt that she would go to the sages and pay good coin to learn every little-known detail about the powerful item. \"He thinks he controls it,\" Dwahvel said. \"Do not underestimate Jarlaxle,\" Entreri replied. \"Many have. They all are dead.\" \"Do not underestimate the Crystal Shard,\" Dwahvel returned without hesitation. \"Many have. They all are dead.\" \"A wonderful combination then,\" Entreri said matter-of- factly. He dropped his chin in his hand, stroking his smooth cheek and bringing his finger to a pinch at the small tuft of hair that remained on his chin, considering the conversation and the implications. \"Jarlaxle can handle the artifact,\" he decided. Dwahvel shrugged noncommittally. \"Even more than that,\" Entreri went on, \"Jarlaxle will welcome the union if Crenshinibon proves his equal. That is the difference between him and me,\" he explained, and though he was speaking to Dwahvel, he was, in fact, really talking to himself, sorting out his many feelings on this complicated issue. \"He will allow Crenshinibon to be his partner, if that is necessary, and will find ways to make their goals one and the same.\" \"But Artemis Entreri has no partners,\" Dwahvel reasoned. Entreri considered the words carefully, and even glanced down at the powerful sword he now wore, a sword possessed of sentience and influence, a sword whose spirit he surely meant to break and dominate. \"No,\" he agreed. \"I have no partners, and I want none. The sword is mine and will serve me. Nothing less.\" \"Or?\" \"Or it will find its way into the acid mouth of a black dragon,\" Entreri strongly assured the halfling, growling with every word, and Dwahvel wasn\u0027t about to argue with those words spoken in that tone. \"Who is the stronger then,\" Dwahvel dared to ask, \"Jarlaxle the partner or Entreri the loner?\" \"I am,\" Entreri assured her without the slightest hesitation. \"Jarlaxle might seem so for now, but inevitably he will find a traitor among his partners who will bring him down.\" \"You never could stand the thought of taking orders,\" Dwahvel said with a laugh. That is why the shape of the world so bothers you!\" \"To take an order implies that you must trust the giver of such,\" Entreri retorted, and the tone of his banter showed that he was taking no offense. In fact, there was an eagerness in his voice rarely heard, a true testament to those many charms of Dwahvel Tiggerwillies. \"That, my dear little Dwahvel, is why the shape of the world so bothers me. I learned at a very young age that I cannot trust in or count on anyone but myself. To do so invites deceit and despair and opens a vulnerability that can be exploited. To do so is a weakness.\" Now it was Dwahvel\u0027s turn to sit back a bit and digest the words. \"But you have come to trust in me, it would seem,\" she said, \"merely by speaking with me such. Have I brought out a weakness in you, my friend?\" Entreri smiled again, a crooked smile that didn\u0027t really tell Dwahvel whether he was amused or merely warning her not to push this observation too far. \"Perhaps it is merely that I know you and your band well enough to hold no fear of you,\" the cocky assassin remarked, rising from his seat and stretching. \"Or maybe it is merely that you have not yet been foolish enough to try to give me an order.\" Still that grin remained, but Dwahvel, too, was smiling, and sincerely. She saw it in Entreri\u0027s eyes now, that little hint of appreciation. Perhaps their talks were a bit of weakness to Entreri\u0027s jaded way of thinking. The truth of it, whether he wanted to admit it or not, was that he did indeed trust her, perhaps more deeply than he had ever trusted anyone in all of his life. At least, more deeply than he had since that first person-and Dwahvel figured that it had to have been a parent or a close family friend-had so deeply betrayed and wounded him. Entreri headed for the door, that casual, easy walk of his, perfect in balance and as graceful as any court dancer. Many heads turned to watch him go-so many were always concerned with the whereabouts of deadly Artemis Entreri. Not so for Dwahvel, though. She had come to understand this relationship, this friendship of theirs, not long after Dondon\u0027s death. She knew that if she ever crossed Artemis Entreri, he would surely kill her, but she knew, too, where those lines of danger lay. Dwahvel\u0027s smile was indeed genuine and comfortable and confident as she watched her dangerous friend leave the Copper Ante that night.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/servant-of-the-shard-paths-of-darkness-3/page-10.html","bookId":2138,"book":{"id":2138,"title":"Servant of the Shard (Paths of Darkness #3)","description":"Storyline: Servant of the Shard (Paths of Darkness #3) With each kill, I grow wiser, and with added wisdom, I grow stronger.
