{"id":101395,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"I went into Merlotte\u0027s early in the morning - for me, that means eight thirty - to check the bar situation, and I remained to cover Arlene\u0027s shift. I\u0027d have to work a double. Thankfully, the lunch crowd was light. I didn\u0027t know if that was a result of Sam\u0027s announcement or just the normal course of things. At least I was able to make a few phone calls while Terry Bellefleur (who made ends meet with several part-time jobs) covered the bar. Terry was in a good mood, or what passed for a good mood for him; he was a Vietnam vet who\u0027d had a very bad war. At heart he was a good guy, and we\u0027d always gotten along. He was really fascinated by the Weres\u0027 revelation; since the war, Terry had done better with animals than people. \"I bet that\u0027s why I\u0027ve always liked to work for Sam,\" Terry said, and I smiled at him. \"I like to work for him, too,\" I said. While Terry kept the beers coming and kept an eye on Jane Bodehouse, one of our alcoholics, I started phoning to find a replacement barmaid. Amelia had told me she would help a little but only at night, because she now had a temporary day job covering the maternity leave of a clerk at the insurance agency. First I phoned Charlsie Tooten. Charlsie, though sympathetic, told me she had the full care of her grandson while her daughter worked, so she was too tired to come in. I called another former Merlotte\u0027s employee, but she\u0027d started work at another bar. Holly had said she could double up once but didn\u0027t want to do it more than that because of her little boy. Danielle, the other full-time server, had said the same. (In Danielle\u0027s case she had twice the excuse because she had two children.) So, finally, with a huge sigh to let Sam\u0027s empty office know how put-upon I was, I called one of my least favorite people - Tanya Grissom, werefox and former saboteur. It took me a while to track her down, but by calling a couple of people out in Hotshot, I was finally able to reach her at Calvin\u0027s house. Tanya had been dating him for a while. I liked the man myself, but when I thought of that cluster of little houses at the ancient crossroads, I shuddered. \"Tanya, how you doing? This is Sookie Stackhouse.\" \"Really. Hmmm. Hello.\" I didn\u0027t blame her for being cautious. \"One of Sam\u0027s barmaids quit - you remember Arlene? She freaked about the were thing and walked out. I was wondering if you could take over a couple of her shifts, just for a while.\" \"You Sam\u0027s partner now?\" She wasn\u0027t going to make this easy. \"No, I\u0027m just doing the looking for him. He got called away on a family emergency.\" \"I was probably on the bottom of your list.\" My brief silence spoke for itself. \"I figure we can work together,\" I said, because I had to say something. \"I got a day job now, but I can help a couple of evenings until you find someone permanent,\" Tanya said. It was hard to read anything from her voice. \"Thanks.\" That gave me two temporaries, Amelia and Tanya, and I could take any hours they couldn\u0027t. This wouldn\u0027t be hard on anyone. \"Can you come in tomorrow for the evening shift? If you could be here about five, five thirty, one of us can show you the ropes again, and then you\u0027ll be working until the bar closes.\" There was a short silence. \"I\u0027ll be there,\" Tanya said. \"I got some black pants. You got a T-shirt I can wear?\" \"Yep. Medium?\" \"That\u0027ll do me.\" She hung up. Well, I could hardly expect to find her happy to hear from me or delighted to oblige since we\u0027d never been fans of each other. In fact, though I didn\u0027t believe she remembered, I\u0027d had her bewitched by Amelia and Amelia\u0027s mentor, Octavia. I still squirmed when I thought of how I\u0027d altered Tanya\u0027s life, but I didn\u0027t think I\u0027d had a lot of choices there. Sometimes you just have to regret things and move on. Sam called while Terry and I were closing the bar. I was so tired. My head was heavy, and my feet were aching. \"How are things going there?\" Sam asked. His voice was rough with exhaustion. \"We\u0027re coping,\" I said, trying to sound perky and carefree. \"How\u0027s your mom?\" \"She\u0027s still alive,\" he said. \"She\u0027s talking and breathing on her own. The doctor says he thinks she\u0027ll recover just fine. My stepfather is under arrest.\" \"What a mess,\" I said, genuinely distressed on Sam\u0027s behalf. \"Mom says she should have told him beforehand,\" he told me. \"She was just scared to.\" \"Well ... rightly so, huh? As it turns out.\" He snorted. \"She figures if she\u0027d had a long talk with him, then let him see her change after he\u0027d watched the change on TV, he would\u0027ve been okay.\" I\u0027d been so busy with the bar I hadn\u0027t had a chance to absorb the television reports of the reactions around the world to this second Great Revelation. I wondered how it was going in Montana, Indiana, Florida? I wondered if any of the famous actors in Hollywood had admitted to being werewolves. What if Ryan Seacrest was fuzzy every full moon? Or Jennifer Love Hewitt or Russell Crowe? (Which I thought was more than likely.) That would make a huge difference in public acceptance. \"Have you seen your stepfather or talked to him?\" \"No, not yet. I can\u0027t make myself. My brother went by. He said Don started crying. It was bad.\" \"Is your sister there?\" \"Well, she\u0027s on her way. She had a hard time arranging child care.\" He sounded a little hesitant. \"She knew about your mom, right?\" I tried to keep the incredulity out of my voice. \"No,\" he said. \"Real often, were parents don\u0027t tell the kids who aren\u0027t affected. My sibs didn\u0027t know about me, either, since they didn\u0027t know about Mom.\" \"I\u0027m sorry,\" I said, which stood for a lot of things. \"I wish you were here,\" Sam said, taking me by surprise. \"I wish I could be more help,\" I said. \"If you can think of anything else I can do, you call me at any hour.\" \"You\u0027re keeping the business running. That counts for a lot,\" he said. \"I better go get some sleep.\" \"Okay, Sam. Talk to you tomorrow, okay?\" \"Sure,\" he said. He sounded so worn-out and sad it was hard not to cry. I felt relieved that I\u0027d put my personal feelings aside to call Tanya, after that conversation. It had been the right thing to do. Sam\u0027s mother being shot for what she was - well, that just put my dislike of Tanya Grissom into perspective. I fell into bed that night, and I don\u0027t think I even twitched after that. I\u0027d been sure the warm glow generated by Sam\u0027s call would carry me through the next day, but the morning started badly. Sam always ordered the supplies and kept up with the inventory, naturally. Also, naturally, he\u0027d forgotten to remind me that he had some cases of beer coming in. I got a phone call from the truck driver, Duff, and I had to leap out of bed and hurry to Merlotte\u0027s. On my way out the door, I glimpsed the blinking light on my answering machine, which I\u0027d been too tired to check the night before. But I didn\u0027t have time to worry about missed messages now. I was simply relieved Duff had thought of calling me when he got no answer at Sam\u0027s. I opened the back door of Merlotte\u0027s, and Duff wheeled the cases in and put them where they were supposed to go. Somewhat nervously, I signed for Sam. By the time that was done and the truck had pulled out of the parking lot, Sarah Jen, the mail carrier, came by with the bar mail and Sam\u0027s personal mail. I accepted both. Sarah Jen had her talking shoes on. She\u0027d heard (already) that Sam\u0027s mom was in the hospital, but I didn\u0027t feel I had to enlighten her about the circumstances. That was Sam\u0027s business. Sarah Jen also wanted to tell me how she wasn\u0027t astonished at all that Sam was a wereanimal, because she\u0027d always thought there was something strange about him. \"He\u0027s a nice guy,\" Sarah Jen admitted. \"I\u0027m not saying he\u0027s not. Just ... something odd there. I wasn\u0027t a bit surprised.\" \"Really? He\u0027s sure said such nice things about you,\" I said sweetly, looking down so the line would be a throwaway. I could see the delight flooding Sarah Jen\u0027s head as clearly as if she\u0027d drawn me a picture. \"He\u0027s always been real polite,\" she said, suddenly seeing Sam in the light of a most perceptive man. \"Well, I better be going. I got to finish the route. If you talk to Sam, tell him I\u0027m thinking of his mom.\" After I carried the mail to Sam\u0027s desk, Amelia called from the insurance agency to tell me that Octavia had called her to ask if either of us could take her to Wal-Mart. Octavia, who\u0027d lost most of her stuff in Katrina, was stuck out at the house without a car. \"You\u0027ll have to take her on your lunch hour,\" I said, barely managing not to snap at Amelia. \"I got a full plate today. And here comes more trouble,\" I said as a car pulled up beside mine in the employee parking lot. \"Here\u0027s Eric\u0027s daytime guy, Bobby Burnham.\" \"Oh, I meant to tell you. Octavia said Eric tried to call you at home twice. So she finally told Bobby where you were this morning,\" Amelia said. \"She figured it might be important. Lucky you. Okay, I\u0027ll take care of Octavia. Somehow.\" \"Good,\" I said, trying not to sound as brusque as I felt. \"Talk to you later.\" Bobby Burnham got out of his Impala and strode up to me. His boss, Eric, was bound to me in a complicated relationship that was based not only on our past history but also on the fact that we\u0027d swapped blood several times. This hadn\u0027t been an informed decision on my part. Bobby Burnham was an asshole. Maybe Eric had gotten him on sale? \"Miss Stackhouse,\" he said, laying the courtliness on thick. \"My master asks that you come to Fangtasia tonight for a sit-down with the new king\u0027s lieutenant.\" This was not the summons I\u0027d expected or the kind of conversation I\u0027d foreseen with the vampire sheriff of Area Five. Given the fact that we had some personal issues to discuss, I\u0027d imagined Eric would call me when things had settled down with the new regime, and we\u0027d make some kind of appointment - or date - to talk about the several items on our mutual plate. I wasn\u0027t pleased by this impersonal summons by a flunky. \"You ever hear of a phone?\" I said. \"He left you messages last night. He told me to talk to you today, without fail. I\u0027m just following orders.\" \"Eric told you to spend your time driving over here and asking me to come to his bar tonight.\" Even to my own ears, I sounded unbelieving. \"Yes. He said, \u0027Track her down, deliver the message in person, and be polite.\u0027 Here I am. Being polite.\" He was telling me the truth, and it was just killing him. That was almost enough to make me smile. Bobby really didn\u0027t like me. The closest I could come to defining why was that Bobby didn\u0027t think I was worthy of Eric\u0027s notice. He didn\u0027t like my less-than-reverent attitude toward Eric, and he couldn\u0027t understand why Pam, Eric\u0027s right-hand vampire, was fond of me, when she wouldn\u0027t give Bobby the time of day. There was nothing I could do to change this, even if Bobby\u0027s dislike had worried me ... and it didn\u0027t. But Eric worried me plenty. I had to talk to him, and I might as well get it over with. It had been late October when I\u0027d last seen him, and it was now mid-January. \"It\u0027ll have to be when I get off here. I\u0027m temporarily in charge,\" I said, sounding neither pleased nor gracious. \"What time? He wants you there at seven. Victor will be there then.\" Victor Madden was the representative of the new king, Felipe de Castro. It had been a bloody takeover, and Eric was the only sheriff of the old regime still standing. Staying in the good graces of the new regime was important to Eric, obviously. I wasn\u0027t yet sure how much of that was my problem. But I was thumbs-up with Felipe de Castro by a happy accident, and I wanted to keep it that way. \"I might be able to get there by seven,\" I said after some inner computation. I tried not to think about how much it would please me to lay eyes on Eric. At least ten times in the past few weeks, I\u0027d caught myself before I\u0027d gotten in my car to drive over to see him. But I\u0027d successfully resisted the impulses, because I\u0027d been able to tell that he was struggling to maintain his position under the new king. \"I\u0027ve got to brief the new gal... . Yeah, seven is just about doable.\" \"He\u0027ll be so relieved,\" Bobby said, managing to work in a sneer. Keep it up, asshole,I thought. And possibly the way I was looking at him conveyed that thought, because Bobby said, \"Really, he will be,\" in as sincere a tone as he could manage. \"Okay, message delivered,\" I said. \"I got to get back to work.\" \"Where\u0027s your boss?\" \"He had a family problem in Texas.\" \"Oh, I thought maybe the dogcatcher got him.\" What a howl. \"Good-bye, Bobby,\" I said, and turned my back on him to go in the back door. \"Here,\" he said, and I turned around, irritated. \"Eric said you would need this.\" He handed me a bundle wrapped in black velvet. Vampires couldn\u0027t give you anything in a Wal-Mart bag or wrapped in Hallmark paper, oh, no. Black velvet. The bundle was secured with a gold tasseled cord, like you\u0027d use to tie back a curtain. Just holding it gave me a bad feeling. \"And what would this be?\" \"I don\u0027t know. I wasn\u0027t tasked with opening it.\" I hate the word \"tasked,\" with \"gifted\" running close behind. \"What am I supposed to do with this?\" I said. \"Eric said, \u0027Tell her to give it to me tonight, in front of Victor.\u0027 \" Eric did nothing without a reason. \"All right,\" I said reluctantly. \"Consider me messaged .\" I got through the next shift okay. Everyone was pitching in to help, and that was pleasing. The cook had been working hard all day; this was maybe the fifteenth short-order cook we\u0027d had since I\u0027d begun working at Merlotte\u0027s. We\u0027d had every variation on a human being you could imagine: black, white, male, female, old, young, dead (yes, a vampire cook), lycanthropically£¨¼�anthrope£© inclined (a werewolf), and probably one or two I\u0027d completely forgotten. This cook, Antoine Lebrun, was real nice. He\u0027d come to us out of Katrina. He\u0027d outstayed most of the other refugees, who\u0027d moved back to the Gulf Coast or moved on. Antoine was in his fifties, his curly hair showing a strand or two of gray. He\u0027d worked concessions at the Superdome, he\u0027d told me the day he got hired, and we\u0027d both shuddered. Antoine got along great with D\u0027Eriq, the busboy who doubled as his assistant. When I went in the kitchen to make sure he had everything he needed, Antoine told me he was really proud to be working for a shapeshifter, and D\u0027Eriq wanted to go over and over his reaction to Sam\u0027s and Tray\u0027s transformations. After he\u0027d left work, D\u0027Eriq had gotten a phone call from his cousin in Monroe, and now D\u0027Eriq wanted to tell us all about his cousin\u0027s wife being a werewolf. D\u0027Eriq\u0027s reaction was what I hoped was typical. Two nights before, many people had discovered that someone they knew personally was a were of some kind. Hopefully, if the were had never shown signs of insanity or violence, these people would be willing to accept that shape-changing was an unthreatening addition to their knowledge of the world. It was even exciting. I hadn\u0027t had time to check reactions around the world, but at least as far as local stuff went, the revelation seemed to be going smoothly. I didn\u0027t get the feeling anyone was going to be firebombing Merlotte\u0027s because of Sam\u0027s dual nature, and I thought Tray\u0027s motorcycle repair business was safe. Tanya was twenty minutes early, which raised her up in my estimation, and I gave her a genuine smile. After we ran over a few of the basics like hours, pay, and Sam\u0027s house rules, I said, \"You like being out there in Hotshot?\" \"Yeah, I do,\" she said, sounding a little surprised. \"The families out in Hotshot, they really get along well. If something goes wrong, they have a meeting and discuss it. Those that don\u0027t like the life, they leave, like Mel Hart did.\" Almost everyone in Hotshot was either a Hart or a Norris. \"He\u0027s really taken up with my brother lately,\" I said, because I was a little curious about Jason\u0027s new friend. \"Yeah, that\u0027s what I hear. Everyone\u0027s glad he\u0027s found someone to hang with after being on his own so long.\" \"Why didn\u0027t he fit in out there?\" I asked directly. Tanya said, \"I understand Mel doesn\u0027t like to share, like you have to if you live in a little community like that. He\u0027s real ... \u0027What\u0027s mine is mine.\u0027 \" She shrugged. \"At least, that\u0027s what they say.\" \"Jason\u0027s like that, too,\" I said. I couldn\u0027t read Tanya\u0027s mind too clearly because of her double nature, but I could read the mood and intent of it, and I understood the other panthers worried about Mel Hart. They were concerned about Mel making it in the big world of Bon Temps, I guessed. Hotshot was its own little universe. I was feeling a bit lighter of heart by the time I\u0027d finished briefing Tanya (who had definitely had experience) and hung up my apron. I gathered my purse and Bobby Burnham\u0027s bundle, and I hurried out the employee door to drive to Shreveport. I started to listen to the news as I drove, but I was tired of grim reality. Instead, I listened to a Mariah Carey CD, and I felt the better for it. I can\u0027t sing worth a damn, but I love to belt out the lyrics to a song when I\u0027m driving. The tensions of the day began to drain away, replaced by an optimistic mood. Sam would come back, his mother having recovered, and her husband having made amends and having pledged he\u0027d love her forever. The world would oooh and aaah about werewolves and other shifters for a while, then all would be normal again. Isn\u0027t it always a bad idea, thinking things like that?","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dead-and-gone-sookie-stackhouse-9/page-2.html","bookId":2199,"book":{"id":2199,"title":"Dead and Gone (Sookie Stackhouse #9)","description":"Storyline: Dead and Gone (Sookie Stackhouse #9) Except for Sookie Stackhouse, folks in Bon Temps, Louisiana, know little about vamps-and nothing about weres.
