{"id":101407,"no":14,"title":"Page 14","content":"I kept my mental ears open that night, so it was a hard evening for me. After years of practice and some help from Bill, I\u0027d learned to block out most of the thoughts of the humans around me. But tonight was just like the bad old days, when I\u0027d smiled all the time to cover the confusion in my head caused by the constant bombardment of mental mutterings.\\n\\n When I walked past the table where Bud Dearborn and his ancient crony Sid Matt Lancaster were having chicken baskets and beers, I heard,Crystal\u0027s no great loss, but no one gets crucified in Renard Parish... . We gotta solve that case, and Got me some genuine werewolves for clients. I wish Elva Deane had lived to see this; she woulda loved it . But mostly Sid Matt was thinking about his hemorrhoids and his spreading cancer.\\n\\n Oh, gosh, I hadn\u0027t known. My next pass by his table, I patted the venerable lawyer on the shoulder. \"Let me know if you need anything,\" I said, and met his turtle like stare with a blank face. He could take it any way he chose, as long as he knew I was willing to help.\\n\\n When you throw out your net that wide, you come up with a lot of trash. I found out over the course of the evening that Tanya thought she might be settling down permanently with Calvin, that Jane Bodehouse thought she had chlamydia and wondered who was responsible, and that Kevin and Kenya, police officers who always requested the same shift, were actually living together now. Since Kenya was black and Kevin couldn\u0027t be whiter, this was causing Kevin\u0027s folks some problems, but he was standing firm. Kenya\u0027s brother wasn\u0027t too happy about her living situation, either, but he wasn\u0027t going to beat up Kevin or anything like that. I gave them a big smile when I brought them bourbon and Cokes, and they smiled back. It was so rare to see Kenya crack a grin that I almost laughed. She looked about five years younger when she smiled.\\n\\n Andy Bellefleur came in with his new wife, Halleigh. I liked Halleigh, and we hugged each other. Halleigh was thinking she might be pregnant, and it would be mighty early in the marriage for them to start a family, but Andy was quite a bit older than her. This maybe-pregnancy hadn\u0027t been planned, so she was pretty worried about how Andy would take the news. Since I was laying myself out there tonight, I tried something new. I sent my extra sense down into Halleigh\u0027s belly. If she really was pregnant, it was too soon for the little brain to be registering.\\n\\n Andy was thinking Halleigh had been quiet the past couple of days, and he was worried something was wrong with her. He was also worried about the investigation of Crystal\u0027s death, and when he felt Bud Dearborn\u0027s eyes on him, he wished he\u0027d picked any other place in Bon Temps for his evening out. The gunfight at Arlene\u0027s trailer was haunting his dreams.\\n\\n Other people in the bar were thinking about typical stuff.\\n\\n What are the all-time most popular thoughts? Well, they\u0027re really, really boring.\\n\\n Most people think about their money problems, what they need from the store, what housework they have to do, how their jobs are going. They worry about their kids ... a lot. They brood over issues with their bosses and their spouses and their coworkers and other members of their churches.\\n\\n On the whole, 95 percent of what I hear is nothing anybody\u0027d want to write down in her diary.\\n\\n Every now and then the guys (less often, the women) think about sex with someone they see in the bar - but honestly, that\u0027s so common I can brush it aside, unless they\u0027re thinking about me. That\u0027s pretty disgusting. The sex ideas multiply with the drinks consumed; no surprise there.\\n\\n The people thinking about Crystal and her death were the law enforcement people charged with finding out who\u0027d killed her. If one of the culprits was in the bar, he was simply not thinking about what he\u0027d done. And there had to be more than a single person involved. Setting up a cross was not something a man on his own could handle; at least not without a lot of preparation and some elaborate arrangement of pulleys. You\u0027d have to be some kind of supernatural to pull it off by yourself.\\n\\n This was Andy Bellefleur\u0027s train of thought while he waited for his crispy chicken salad.\\n\\n I had to agree with him. I\u0027d bet Calvin had already considered that scenario. Calvin had sniffed the body, and he hadn\u0027t said he\u0027d smelled another wereanimal of any kind. But then I recalled that one of the two men who\u0027d been wheeling the body out had been a supe.\\n\\n As far as learning anything new, I was drawing a blank until Mel came in. Mel, who lived in one of Sam\u0027s rental duplexes, looked like a reject from the cast of Robin Hood, the Musical tonight. His longish light brown hair, neat mustache and beard, and tight pants gave him a theatrical air.\\n\\n Mel surprised me by giving me a half hug before he sat down, as if I were a good buddy of his.\\n\\n If this behavior was because he and my brother were both panthers ... but that still didn\u0027t make a lot of sense. None of the other werepanthers got cozy with me because of Jason - far from it. The Hotshot community had been a lot warmer toward me when Calvin Norris had been thinking of asking me to be his mate. Did Mel have a secret yearning to go out with me? That would be ... unpleasant and unwelcome.\\n\\n I took a little trip into Mel\u0027s head, where I saw no lusty thoughts about me. If he\u0027d been attracted, he\u0027d have been thinking them, since I was right in front of him. Mel was thinking about the things Catfish Hennessy, Jason\u0027s boss, had been saying about Jason in Bon Temps Auto Parts that day. Catfish\u0027s tolerance balloon had burst, and he\u0027d told Mel he was thinking about firing Jason.\\n\\n Mel was plenty worried about my brother, bless his heart. I\u0027d wondered my whole life how someone as selfish as my brother could attract such faithful friends. My great-grandfather had told me that people with a trace of fairy blood were more attractive to other humans, so maybe that explained it.\\n\\n I went behind the bar to pour some more tea for Jane Bodehouse, who was trying to be sober today because she was trying to compile a list of the guys who might have given her chlamydia. A bar is a bad place to start a sobriety program - but Jane had hardly any chance of succeeding, anyway. I put a slice of lemon in the tea and carried it to Jane, watched her hands shake as she picked up the glass and drank from it.\\n\\n \"You want something to eat?\" I asked, keeping my voice low and quiet. Just because I\u0027d never seen a drunk reform in a bar, that didn\u0027t mean it couldn\u0027t happen.\\n\\n Jane shook her head silently. Her dyed brown hair was already escaping the clip that held it back, and her heavy black sweater was covered with bits of this and that. Her makeup had been applied with a shaky hand. I could see the lipstick caked in the creases in her lips. Most of the area alcoholics might stop in Merlotte\u0027s every now and then, but they based themselves at the Bayou. Jane was our only \"resident\" alkie since old Willie Chenier had died. When Jane was in the bar, she always sat on the same stool. Hoyt had made a label for it when he\u0027d had too much to drink one night, but Sam had made him take it off.\\n\\n I looked in Jane\u0027s head for an awful minute or two, and I watched the slow shifting of thoughts behind her eyes, noticed the broken veins in her cheeks. The thought of becoming like Jane was enough to scare almost anyone sober.\\n\\n I turned away to find Mel standing beside me. He was on his way to the men\u0027s room, because that\u0027s what was in his head when I looked.\\n\\n \"You know what they do in Hotshot with people like that?\" he asked quietly, nodding his head toward Jane as if she couldn\u0027t see or hear him. (Actually, I thought he was right about that. Jane was turned so inward that she didn\u0027t seem to be acknowledging the world much today.)\\n\\n \"No,\" I said, startled.\\n\\n \"They let them die,\" he said. \"They don\u0027t offer them food or water or shelter, if the person can\u0027t seek it for himself or herself.\"\\n\\n I\u0027m sure my horror showed on my face.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s kindest in the end,\" he said. He drew a deep, shuddering breath. \"Hotshot has its ways of getting rid of the weak.\"\\n\\n He went on his way, his back stiff.\\n\\n I patted Jane on the shoulder, but I\u0027m afraid I wasn\u0027t really thinking about her. I was wondering what Mel had done to deserve his exile to a duplex in Bon Temps. If it had been me, I would have been happy to be rid of the multiple ties of kinship and the microscopic hierarchy of the little cluster of houses huddled around the old crossroads, but I could tell that wasn\u0027t the way Mel felt about it.\\n\\n Mel\u0027s ex-wife had a margarita in Merlotte\u0027s from time to time. I thought I might do a little research on my brother\u0027s new buddy the next time Ginjer dropped by.\\n\\n Sam asked me a couple of times if I was okay, and I was surprised by the strength of my desire to talk to him about everything that had happened lately. I was astonished to realize how often I confided in Sam, how much he knew about my secret life. But I knew that Sam had enough on his plate right now. He was on the phone with his sister and his brother several times during the evening, which was really unusual for him. He looked harassed and worried, and it would be selfish to add to that load of worry.\\n\\n The cell phone in my apron pocket vibrated a couple of times, and when I had a free moment, I ducked into the ladies\u0027 room and checked my text messages. One from Eric. \"Protection coming,\" it said. That was good. There was another message, and this one was from Alcide Herveaux, the Shreveport pack leader. \"Tray called. Trouble Ur way?\" it read. \"We owe U.\"\\n\\n My chances of survival had risen considerably, and I felt much more cheerful as I finished out my shift.\\n\\n It was good to have stockpiled favors with both vampires and werewolves. Maybe all the shit I\u0027d gone through last fall would prove to have been worth it after all.\\n\\n All in all, though, I had to say my project for the evening had been a washout. Sure, after asking Sam for permission, I\u0027d filled both the plastic water guns with juice from the lemons in the refrigerator (intended for iced tea). I thought maybe real lemons would somehow be more potent than the bottled lemon juice at home. So I felt a little safer, but the sum total of my knowledge about the death of Crystal had not increased by one fact. Either the murderers hadn\u0027t come in the bar, weren\u0027t fretting over the evil thing they\u0027d done, or weren\u0027t thinking about it at the moment I was looking inside their heads.Or, I thought,all of the above . \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dead-and-gone-sookie-stackhouse-9/page-14.html","bookId":2199,"book":{"id":2199,"title":"Dead and Gone (Sookie Stackhouse #9)","description":"Storyline: Dead and Gone (Sookie Stackhouse #9) \\n Except for Sookie Stackhouse, folks in Bon Temps, Louisiana, know little about vamps-and nothing about weres. \\n Until now.
