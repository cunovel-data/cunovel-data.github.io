{"id":101406,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"\"Amelia, what works against fairies?\" I asked. I\u0027d gotten a full night\u0027s sleep, and I was feeling much better in consequence. Amelia\u0027s boss was out of town, so she had the afternoon off. \"You mean something that\u0027ll act as a fairy repellent?\" she asked. \"Yeah, or cause fairy death even,\" I said. \"That\u0027s preferable to me getting killed. I need to defend myself.\" \"I don\u0027t know too much about fairies, since they\u0027re so rare and secretive,\" she said. \"I wasn\u0027t sure they still existed until I heard about your great-grandfather. You need something like Mace for fairies, huh?\" I had a sudden idea. \"I\u0027ve already got some, Amelia,\" I said, feeling happier than I had in days. I looked in the racks on the door of the refrigerator. Sure enough, there was a bottle of ReaLemon. \"Now all I got to do is buy a water pistol at Wal-Mart,\" I said. \"It\u0027s not summer, but surely they\u0027ve got some over in the toy department.\" \"That works?\" \"Yeah, a little-known supernatural fact. Just contact with it is fatal. I understand if it\u0027s ingested, the result\u0027s even quicker. If you could squirt it in a fairy\u0027s open mouth, that would be one dead fairy.\" \"Sounds like you\u0027re in big trouble, Sookie.\" Amelia had been reading, but now she laid her book on the table. \"Yeah, I am.\" \"You want to talk about it?\" \"It\u0027s complicated. Hard to explain.\" \"I understand the definition of \u0027complicated.\u0027\" \"Sorry. Well, it might not be safe for you to learn the ins and outs of it. Can you help? Will your wards work against fairies?\" \"I\u0027ll check my sources,\" Amelia said in that wise way she had when she didn\u0027t have a clue. \"I\u0027ll call Octavia if I have to.\" \"I\u0027d appreciate it. And if you need some kind of spell-casting ingredients, money is no object.\" I\u0027d gotten a check in the mail that very morning from Sophie-Anne\u0027s estate. Mr. Cataliades had come through with the money she\u0027d owed me. I was going to run it to the bank this afternoon, since the drive-through would be open. Amelia took a deep breath, stalled. I waited. Since she\u0027s an exceptionally clear broadcaster, I knew what she wanted to talk about, but to keep our relationship on an even keel, I simply held out until she spoke out loud. \"I heard from Tray, who\u0027s got a couple friends on the police force - though not many - that Whit and Arlene are denying up and down that they killed Crystal. They ... Arlene says they planned on making you an example of what happens to people who hang around with the supernatural; that it was Crystal\u0027s death that gave them the idea.\" My good mood evaporated. I felt a profound depression settle on my shoulders. Hearing this spoken out loud made it seem even more horrible. I could think of no comment to offer. \"What does Tray hear about what might happen to them?\" I said finally. \"Depends on whose bullet hit Agent Weiss. If it was Donny\u0027s - well, he\u0027s dead. Whit can say he was being shot at, so he shot back. He can say he didn\u0027t know anything about a plan to harm you. He was visiting his girlfriend and happened to have some pieces of wood in the back of his pickup.\" \"What about Helen Ellis?\" \"She told Andy Bellefleur she just came to the trailer to pick up the kids because they\u0027d done really well on their report cards, and she\u0027d promised to take them to the Sonic for an ice cream treat. Any more than that, she doesn\u0027t know diddly squat.\" Amelia\u0027s face expressed extreme skepticism. \"So Arlene is the only one talking.\" I dried the baking sheet. I\u0027d made biscuits that morning. Baking therapy, cheap and satisfying. \"Yeah, and she may recant any minute. She was real shaken up when she talked, but she\u0027ll wise up. Maybe too late. At least we can hope so.\" I\u0027d been right; Arlene was the weakest link. \"She gotten a lawyer?\" \"Yeah. She couldn\u0027t afford Sid Matt Lancaster, so she hired Melba Jennings.\" \"Good move,\" I said thoughtfully. Melba Jennings was only a couple of years older than me. She was the only African-American woman in Bon Temps who\u0027d been to law school. She had a hard-as-nails facade and was confrontational in the extreme. Other lawyers had been known to take incredible detours to dodge Melba if they saw her coming. \"Makes her look less of a bigot.\" \"I don\u0027t think it\u0027s going to fool anyone, but Melba\u0027s like a pit bull.\" Melba had been in Amelia\u0027s insurance agency on behalf of a couple of clients. \"I better go make my bed,\" Amelia said, standing and stretching. \"Hey, Tray and I are going to the movies in Clarice tonight. Want to come?\" \"You\u0027ve really been trying to include me on your dates. You\u0027re not getting bored with Tray already, I hope?\" \"Not a bit,\" Amelia said, sounding faintly surprised. \"In fact, I think he\u0027s great. Tray\u0027s buddy Drake has been pestering him, though. Drake\u0027s seen you in the bar, and he wants to get to know you.\" \"He a Were?\" \"Just a guy. Thinks you\u0027re pretty.\" \"I don\u0027t do regular guys,\" I said, smiling. \"It just doesn\u0027t work out very well.\" It \"worked out\" disastrously, as a matter of fact. Imagine knowing what your date thinks of you every single minute. Plus, there was the issue of Eric and our undefined but intimate relationship. \"Keep the possibility on the back burner. He\u0027s really cute, and by cute, I mean hotter than a steam iron.\" After Amelia had tromped up the stairs, I poured myself a glass of tea. I tried to read, but I found I couldn\u0027t concentrate on the book. Finally, I slid my paper bookmark in and stared into space, thinking about a lot of things. I wondered where Arlene\u0027s children were now. With Arlene\u0027s old aunt, who lived over in Clarice? Or still with Helen Ellis? Did Helen like Arlene enough to keep Coby and Lisa? I couldn\u0027t rid myself of a nagging feeling of responsibility for the kids\u0027 sad situation, but it was going to have to be one of those things I simply suffered. The person really responsible was Arlene. There was nothing I could do for them. As if thinking of children had triggered a nerve in the universe, the phone rang. I got up and went to the wall-mounted unit in the kitchen. \"Hello,\" I said without enthusiasm. \"Ms. Stackhouse? Sookie?\" \"Yes, this is she,\" I said properly. \"This is Remy Savoy.\" My dead cousin Hadley\u0027s ex, father of her child. \"I\u0027m glad you called. How\u0027s Hunter?\" Hunter was a \"gifted\" child, God bless him. He\u0027d been \"gifted\" the same way I had been. \"He\u0027s fine. Uh, about that thing.\" \"Sure.\" We were going to talk telepathy. \"He\u0027s going to need some guidance soon. He\u0027ll be starting kindergarten. They\u0027re going to notice. I mean, it\u0027ll take a while, but sooner or later ...\" \"Yeah, they\u0027ll notice all right.\" I opened my mouth to suggest that Remy bring Hunter over on my next day off or that I could drive to Red Ditch. But then I remembered that I was the target of a group of homicidal fairies. Not a good time for a young \u0027un to come visiting, and who\u0027s to say they couldn\u0027t follow me to Remy\u0027s little house? So far none of them knew about Hunter. I hadn\u0027t even told my great-grandfather about Hunter\u0027s special talent. If Niall himself didn\u0027t know, maybe none of the hostiles had uncovered the information. On the whole, better to take no risks. \"I really want to meet with him and get to know him. I promise I\u0027ll help him as much as I can,\" I said. \"Right now, it just isn\u0027t possible. But since we have a little time to spare before kindergarten ... maybe in a month or so?\" \"Oh,\" Remy said in a nonplussed way. \"I was hoping to bring him over on my day off.\" \"I have a little situation here that I have to resolve.\" If I was alive after it was resolved ... but I wasn\u0027t going to imagine that. I tried to think of a palatable excuse, and of course, I did have one. \"My sister-in-law just died,\" I told Remy. \"Can I call you when I\u0027m not so busy with the details of ...\" I couldn\u0027t think of a way to wrap up that sentence. \"I promise it\u0027ll be soon. If you don\u0027t have a day off, maybe Kristen could bring him?\" Kristen was Remy\u0027s girlfriend. \"Well, that\u0027s part of the problem,\" Remy said, and he sounded tired but also a little amused. \"Hunter told Kristen that he knew she didn\u0027t really like him, and that she should stop thinking about his daddy without any clothes on.\" I drew a deep breath, tried not to laugh, didn\u0027t manage it. \"I am sorry,\" I said. \"How did Kristen handle that?\" \"She started crying. Then she told me she loved me but my kid was a freak, and she left.\" \"Worst possible scenario,\" I said. \"Ah ... do you think she\u0027ll tell other people?\" \"Don\u0027t see why she wouldn\u0027t.\" This sounded depressingly familiar: shades of my painful childhood. \"Remy, I\u0027m sorry,\" I said. Remy had seemed like a nice guy on our brief acquaintance, and I had been able to see he was devoted to his son. \"If it makes you feel any better, I survived that somehow.\" \"But did your parents?\" There was a trace of a smile in his voice, to his credit. \"No,\" I said. \"However, it didn\u0027t have anything to do with me. They got caught by a flash flood when they were driving home one night. It was pouring rain, visibility was terrible, the water was black like the road, and they just drove down onto the bridge and got swept away.\" Something buzzed in my brain, some kind of signal that this thought was significant. \"I\u0027m sorry, I was just joking,\" Remy was saying in a shocked voice. \"No, no problem. Just one of those things,\" I said, the way you do when you don\u0027t want the other person to fuss about your feelings. We left it that I would call him when I had \"some free time.\" (That actually meant \"when no one\u0027s trying to kill me,\" but I didn\u0027t explain that to Remy.) I hung up and sat on the stool by the kitchen counter. I was thinking about my parents\u0027 deaths for the first time in a while. I had some sad memories, but that was the saddest of all. Jason had been ten, and I had been seven, so my recollection wasn\u0027t precise, but we\u0027d talked about it over the years, of course, and my grandmother had recounted the story many times, especially as she grew older. It never varied. The torrential rain, the road leading down into the little hollow where the creek ran, the black water ... and they\u0027d been swept away into the dark. The truck had been found the next day; their bodies, a day or two after that. I got dressed for work automatically. I slicked my hair up in an extra-tight ponytail, making sure any stray hairs were gelled into place. As I was tying my shoes, Amelia dashed downstairs to tell me that she\u0027d checked her witch reference books. \"The best way to kill fairies is with iron.\" Her face was lit with triumph. I hated to rain on her parade. Lemons were even better, but it was kind of hard to slip a fairy a lemon without the fairy realizing it. \"I knew that,\" I said, trying not to sound depressed. \"I mean, I appreciate the effort, but I need to be able to knock them out.\" So I could run away. I didn\u0027t know if I could stand to have to hose down the driveway again. Of course, killing the enemy beat the alternative: letting them catch me and do what they wished with me. Amelia was ready for her date with Tray. She was wearing high heels with her designer jeans, an unusual look for Amelia. \"What\u0027s with the heels?\" I asked, and Amelia grinned, displaying her excellent white teeth. \"Tray likes \u0027em,\" she said. \"With the jeans on or off. You should see the lingerie I\u0027m wearing!\" \"I\u0027ll pass,\" I said. \"If you want to meet us after you get off work, I\u0027m betting Drake will be there. He\u0027s seriously interested in getting to know you. And he\u0027s cute, though his looks may not exactly appeal to you.\" \"Why? What\u0027s this Drake look like?\" I asked, mildly curious. \"That\u0027s the freaky part. He looks a lot like your brother.\" Amelia looked at me doubtfully. \"That might weird you out, huh?\" I felt all the blood drain out of my face. I\u0027d gotten to my feet to leave, but I sat down abruptly. \"Sookie? What\u0027s the matter? Sookie?\" Amelia was hovering around me anxiously. \"Amelia,\" I croaked, \"you got to avoid this guy. I mean it. You and Tray get away from him. And for God\u0027s sake, don\u0027t answer any questions about me!\" I could see from the guilt on her face she had already answered quite a few. Though she was a clever witch, Amelia couldn\u0027t always tell when people weren\u0027t really people . Evidently, neither could Tray - though the sweet smell of even a half fairy should have alerted a Were. Maybe Dermot had the same scent-masking ability that his father, my great-grandfather, did. \"Who is he?\" Amelia asked. She was scared, which was good. \"He\u0027s ...\" I tried to formulate the best explanation. \"He wants to kill me.\" \"Does this have something to do with Crystal\u0027s death?\" \"I don\u0027t think so,\" I said. I tried to give the possibility some rational consideration, found my brain simply couldn\u0027t deal with the idea. \"I don\u0027t get it,\" Amelia said. \"We have months - well, weeks - of nothing but plain old life, and then, all of a sudden, here we are!\" She threw up her hands. \"You can move back to New Orleans if you want to,\" I said, my voice faltering. Of course, Amelia knew she could leave anytime she wanted, but I wanted to make it clear I wasn\u0027t sucking her into my problems unless she chose to be sucked. So to speak. \"No,\" she said firmly. \"I like it here, and my house in New Orleans isn\u0027t ready, anyway.\" She kept saying that. Not that I wanted her to leave, but I couldn\u0027t see what the delay was. After all, her dad was a builder. \"You don\u0027t miss New Orleans?\" \"Of course I do,\" Amelia said. \"But I like it here, and I like my little suite upstairs, and I like Tray, and I like my little jobs that keep me going. And I also like - a hell of a lot - being out of my dad\u0027s line of sight.\" She patted me on the shoulder. \"You go off to work and don\u0027t worry. If I haven\u0027t thought of anything by morning, I\u0027ll call Octavia. Now that I know the deal about this Drake, I\u0027ll stonewall him. And Tray will, too. No one can stonewall like Tray.\" \"He\u0027s very dangerous, Amelia,\" I said. I couldn\u0027t impress that on my roommate emphatically enough. \"Yeah, yeah, I get that,\" she said. \"But you know, I\u0027m not any little honey myself, and Dawson can fight with the best of \u0027em.\" We gave each other a hug, and I allowed myself to immerse in Amelia\u0027s mind. It was warm, busy, curious, and ... forward-looking. No brooding on the past for Amelia Broadway. She gave me a pat on the back to signal she was letting go, and we stepped back from each other. I ran by the bank, then I stopped at Wal-Mart. After a bit of searching, I found one little rack of water guns. I got a two-pack of the clear plastic version, one blue and one yellow. When I thought of the ferocity and strength of the fairy race, and the fact that it took all I had to open the damn blister pack and extricate the water pistols, my chosen method of defense seemed ludicrous. I\u0027d be armed with a plastic water pistol and a trowel. I tried to clear my mind of all the worries that were plaguing me. There was so much to think about... . Actually, there was so much to fear. It might be time to take a leaf from Amelia\u0027s book and look forward. What did I need to do tonight ? Which one of my ongoing worries could I actually do something to solve? I could listen in the bar tonight for clues about Crystal\u0027s death, as Jason had asked me to do. (I would have done it anyway, but it seemed even more important to track down her killers now that danger seemed to be piling up from all directions.) I could arm myself against fairy attack. I could be alert for any more Fellowship gangs. And I could try to arrange some more defense. After all, I was supposed to be under the protection of the Shreveport Were pack because I\u0027d helped them out. I was also under the protection of the new vampire regime because I\u0027d saved their leader\u0027s ass. Felipe de Castro would have been a pile of ash if not for me; for that matter, so would Eric. Wasn\u0027t this the best time in the world to call in those markers? I got out of my car behind Merlotte\u0027s. I looked up at the sky, but it was cloudy. I thought it was only a week after the new moon. And it was definitely full dark. I pulled my cell phone out of my purse. I\u0027d discovered Eric\u0027s cell number scrawled on the back of one of his business cards, tucked halfway under my bedside phone. He answered on the second ring. \"Yes,\" he said, and I was able to tell by that one word that he was with others. A little shiver went down my spine at the sound of his voice. \"Eric,\" I said, and then wished I\u0027d spent a little time framing my request. \"The king said he owed me,\" I continued, realizing this was a little bald and bold. \"I\u0027m in real danger. I wonder what he could do about that.\" \"The threat involving your older kin?\" Yes, he was definitely with other people. \"Yes. The, ah, enemy has been trying to get Amelia and Tray to introduce him to me. He doesn\u0027t seem to realize I would recognize him, or maybe he\u0027s very good at pretending. He\u0027s supposed to be on the anti-human side, but he\u0027s half human. I don\u0027t understand his behavior.\" \"I see,\" Eric said after an appreciable pause. \"So protection is necessary.\" \"Yes.\" \"And you ask this as ... ?\" If he\u0027d been with his own underlings, he\u0027d have told them to leave so he could talk to me frankly. Since he hadn\u0027t done that, he was probably with one of the Nevada vamps: Sandy Sechrest, Victor Madden, or Felipe de Castro himself, though that was unlikely. Castro\u0027s far more lucrative business ventures in Nevada required his presence most of the time. I finally realized Eric was trying to find out if I was asking as his bed buddy and \"wife,\" or as someone he owed big-time. \"I ask this as someone who saved Felipe de Castro\u0027s life,\" I said. \"I\u0027ll present this petition to Victor, since he\u0027s here at the bar,\" Eric said smoothly. \"I\u0027ll get back to you this night.\" \"Great.\" Mindful of vamps\u0027 extreme hearing, I added, \"I appreciate that, Eric,\" as if we were friendly acquaintances. Mentally dodging the question of what we actually were to each other, I tucked away the cell phone and went into work, hustling because I was a couple of minutes late. Now that I\u0027d talked to Eric, I felt much more optimistic about my chances of survival.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dead-and-gone-sookie-stackhouse-9/page-13.html","bookId":2199,"book":{"id":2199,"title":"Dead and Gone (Sookie Stackhouse #9)","description":"Storyline: Dead and Gone (Sookie Stackhouse #9) Except for Sookie Stackhouse, folks in Bon Temps, Louisiana, know little about vamps-and nothing about weres.
