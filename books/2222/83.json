Anything you say—” “I know my fucking rights,” Nye said. “I’ve been Mirandized a dozen times already.” “Just so you understand.” “Let’s just get on with it, all right?” “Let’s.” Briggs removed a lacquered pen from his jacket pocket and slowly rotated the barrel to lower the tip into writing position. He turned the yellow pad on the table in front of him until it rested at a perfect angle before reviewing it. Nye beat an impatient rhythm on the tabletop with his fingers while he waited. “First of all, you’re already going to prison for five years,” Briggs said. “That’s prison. Not jail. You violated the terms of your parole the second you picked up the gun.” “Shit,” Nye muttered. “You have a criminal history score of three,” Briggs added. “Do you know about the criminal history score? How it works?” “Yeah.” “In Minnesota, the more crimes you’re convicted of, the greater your score.” “Yeah.” “The greater your score, the more time you do for each conviction.” “I said I knew. Jesus Christ, get on with it.” “All right,” Briggs said, not flustered at all and in no particular hurry. “We have you for first degree assault—” “First degree?” “Ms. Miller is in Mercy Hospital with a broken nose, fractured jaw, two broken teeth, three cracked ribs, and a ruptured spleen. Where I come from, that constitutes first degree.” “Shit,” Nye said. “With your score, that’s one hundred and twenty-two months. We also have you for two counts of second degree assault for shooting at Ms. Miller and Mr. McKenzie. ‘Course, if you had hit ’em, then it would be first—” “Fuckin’ McKenzie was shooting at me.” “Are you pleading self-defense?” “I’m just saying.” “Well, let’s say that charge holds up. We could go for attempted murder instead. You beat up Miller. Miller calls McKenzie. McKenzie comes running. You ambush him. Yeah, I think I can make a case for attempted murder. How ‘bout you? Want me to try? It’ll screw up the math, but I’m willing.” “Shit.” “ ’Course, if we had been real lucky, McKenzie would have splattered your brains all over the parking lot—he’s done it before.” I continued to shiver behind the glass. Nye smiled the uncontrollable smile of a man who knew he was in deep trouble and it was just getting worse. “Something funny, Nye?” Briggs asked. Nye shook his head. “I’ll tell ya what I think is funny,” Briggs said. “First degree assault, plus two counts of second degree assault at thirty-four months each, plus the five years for your parole violation . . . Why, Richard. You’re going to prison for twenty-one years.” Nye studied Briggs’s beaming face for a moment. “Fourteen years if I get a third off for good time,” he said. “That’s right.” “Fourteen years if the judge adheres strictly to the Minnesota Sentencing Guidelines.” “They usually do.” “Fourteen years if the sentences are served consecutively.” “Right again.” “The sentences, they all could be served concurrently with the parole violation.” “Could be,” said Briggs. “That would mean I would get out in”—Nye did the math quickly—“six and a half years.” “Six years, eight months to be precise,” Briggs said. “Or less.” “Could very well be less. Especially if you agree to testify in all the meth cases. Except. . .” “Except what?” “Do you see anyone around here willing to make a sentencing recommendation?” Nye smiled and leaned across the conference room table. “What if I make it easy for you and cop a plea?” “On what?” “On everything.” “That would make me very happy,” Briggs said. “Save the taxpayers a lot of money in court fees, too.” “How happy?” Briggs rubbed his chin, pretending he was deep in thought, pretending he hadn’t known exactly what he was going to offer Nye before he even entered the room. Tuseman muttered something unintelligible, then added, “Get on with it.” “You go down for the nickel plus one,” Briggs said at last. “Six years.” “Five,” said Nye. “Six,” repeated Briggs. “And this time you do every fucking day.” “I can live with that.” “One more thing.” “Yeah?” “I want you to tell me the truth about Eli Jefferson.” Behind the one-way mirror, G. K. Bonalay exhaled sharply. David Tuseman stepped away from the glass and rested against the opposite wall. I continued to shiver. “I don’t know nothing about Jefferson,” Nye said. Briggs rose abruptly from his chair, snatched the yellow pad off the table, and moved toward the door. “Wait a minute, man,” Nye called to him. “Wait for what? You can do the fourteen.”","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dead-boyfriends-mac-mckenzie-4/page-83.html","bookId":2222,"book":{"id":2222,"title":"Dead Boyfriends (Mac McKenzie #4)","description":"Storyline: Right up until they put him in jail, McKenzie thought the cops were kidding. After all, he did them a favor by stopping a rookie cop from roughing up a distraught woman at a murder scene. But the next thing Mac knows he\u0027s in jail, missing an important date with his girlfriend and reliving nightmares he thought he\u0027d finally left behind - and he\u0027s vowing payback for all of it. If that means sticking his nose into a crime investigation, well, he\u0027s done it before. Only, what appears to be a straightforward case of a cheating boyfriend, his alcoholic girlfriend and an opportune baseball bat proves far more complicated than the police are willing to accept. More disconcerting, as he investigates, Mac finds himself again fighting the influence of a shadowy figure who controls more of what goes on in the Twin Cities than a rational voter would believe. And then there are the unidentified thugs who kill a witness and rough up him and his female lawyer-ally. Soon Mac realizes that the truth of this sordid crime may be as hard to find - and as hard to live with - as the justice he seeks.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/dead-boyfriends-mac-mckenzie-4.jpg","author":"David Housewright","type":"Thriller","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/dead-boyfriends-mac-mckenzie-4.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:28 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:45:13 PM"}}
