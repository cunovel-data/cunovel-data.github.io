After word of what Merodie had done leaked out, he was thoroughly chastised in the media for not being able to protect his prisoners. Next, a district court judge rejected his claim on Richard Scott Nye and ordered that he be transferred to the custody of the Hennepin County attorney. It was more or less a technicality anyway, since Nye was in Mercy Hospital at the time having a glass eye inserted into his socket. The prosecutor immediately charged him with second degree murder and first degree criminal sexual conduct, which pretty much removed any remaining incentive Nye might have had to testify in Tuseman’s meth trials. As a result, Tuseman was forced to drop the charges against half the suspects, and of the nine he actually brought to trial, five were acquitted. The TV and newspapers—along with his political opponents—crucified him for his incompetence. True, he wasn’t entirely to blame, but hey, he who lives by the mass media dies by the mass media. Eventually, he was forced to resign as county attorney, and Rollie Briggs took over.\\n\\n As for the State Senate, Tuseman was defeated in the primary by a three-to-one margin. The next day, Mr. Muehlenhaus sent me a case of Aberlour ten-year-old single malt, sherry-cask scotch. I would have sent it back except, well, it was Aberlour ten-year-old single malt, sherry-cask scotch.\\n\\n Meanwhile, Richard Scott Nye was sentenced to 366 months in Stillwater State Prison. He might have been hammered for 488 months, but he cut a deal: In exchange for guilty pleas, he was ordered to serve his sentences for murder and rape concurrently. He was never tried for beating Debbie Miller or attempting to shoot me. Such is life.\\n\\n I went to see the therapist Jillian DeMarais had set me up with. He was a nice enough guy, but after three sessions I didn’t think we were making much progress, so I stopped going. Besides, the dreams went away after a couple of weeks, just as I had predicted they would.\\n\\n Silk St. Ana finished eighth in the ten-meter platform diving competition at the Summer Olympic Games, but you’d think she won the gold by the way the TV cameras followed her around and network announcers gushed over her bright future and stunning good looks. Twice during the competition she waved at the cameras and mouthed, “Hi, Mom.”\\n\\n Merodie Davies probably didn’t notice. At the time, she was doing thirty-four months and a day for second degree assault at the Minnesota Correctional Facility for Women in Shakopee. Cilia did notice, though, sitting in the stands, yet also following the action on a miniature TV. Cameras caught her watching Silk wave her greeting. She cried both times.\\n\\n As for me, I was left with a couple of questions. Did Priscilla St. Ana kill her father, her brother, and Brian Becker? Did I help let a stone killer go free? Not knowing the answers bothered me for a long, long time. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dead-boyfriends-mac-mckenzie-4/page-92.html","bookId":2222,"book":{"id":2222,"title":"Dead Boyfriends (Mac McKenzie #4)","description":"Storyline: Right up until they put him in jail, McKenzie thought the cops were kidding. After all, he did them a favor by stopping a rookie cop from roughing up a distraught woman at a murder scene. But the next thing Mac knows he\u0027s in jail, missing an important date with his girlfriend and reliving nightmares he thought he\u0027d finally left behind - and he\u0027s vowing payback for all of it. If that means sticking his nose into a crime investigation, well, he\u0027s done it before. \\n Only, what appears to be a straightforward case of a cheating boyfriend, his alcoholic girlfriend and an opportune baseball bat proves far more complicated than the police are willing to accept. More disconcerting, as he investigates, Mac finds himself again fighting the influence of a shadowy figure who controls more of what goes on in the Twin Cities than a rational voter would believe. And then there are the unidentified thugs who kill a witness and rough up him and his female lawyer-ally. Soon Mac realizes that the truth of this sordid crime may be as hard to find - and as hard to live with - as the justice he seeks.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/dead-boyfriends-mac-mckenzie-4.jpg","author":"David Housewright","type":"Thriller","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/dead-boyfriends-mac-mckenzie-4.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:28 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:45:13 PM"}}
