{"id":34510,"no":8,"title":"CHAPTER VII.","content":"AFTER A CURIOUS ADVENTURE UPON THE PONT NEUF, ISRAEL ENTERS THE PRESENCE OF THE RENOWNED SAGE, DR. FRANKLIN, WHOM HE FINDS RIGHT LEARNEDLY AND MULTIFARIOUSLY EMPLOYED. Following the directions given him at the place where the diligence stopped, Israel was crossing the Pont Neuf, to find Doctor Franklin, when he was suddenly called to by a man standing on one side of the bridge, just under the equestrian statue of Henry IV.— The man had a small, shabby-looking box before him on the ground, with a box of blacking on one side of it, and several shoe-brushes upon the other. Holding another brush in his hand, he politely seconded his verbal invitation by gracefully flourishing the brush in the air. \"What do you want of me, neighbor?\" said Israel, pausing in somewhat uneasy astonishment. \"Ah, Monsieur,\" exclaimed the man, and with voluble politeness he ran on with a long string of French, which of course was all Greek to poor Israel. But what his language failed to convey, his gestures now made very plain. Pointing to the wet muddy state of the bridge, splashed by a recent rain, and then to the feet of the wayfarer, and lastly to the brush in his hand, he appeared to be deeply regretting that a gentleman of Israel\u0027s otherwise imposing appearance should be seen abroad with unpolished boots, offering at the same time to remove their blemishes. \"Ah, Monsieur, Monsieur,\" cried the man, at last running up to Israel. And with tender violence he forced him towards the box, and lifting this unwilling customer\u0027s right foot thereon, was proceeding vigorously to work, when suddenly illuminated by a dreadful suspicion, Israel, fetching the box a terrible kick, took to his false heels and ran like mad over the bridge. Incensed that his politeness should receive such an ungracious return, the man pursued, which but confirming Israel in his suspicions he ran all the faster, and thanks to his fleetness, soon succeeded in escaping his pursuer. Arrived at last at the street and the house to which he had been directed, in reply to his summons, the gate very strangely of itself swung open, and much astonished at this unlooked-for sort of enchantment, Israel entered a wide vaulted passage leading to an open court within. While he was wondering that no soul appeared, suddenly he was hailed from a dark little window, where sat an old man cobbling shoes, while an old woman standing by his side was thrusting her head into the passage, intently eyeing the stranger. They proved to be the porter and portress, the latter of whom, upon hearing his summons, had invisibly thrust open the gate to Israel, by means of a spring communicating with the little apartment. Upon hearing the name of Doctor Franklin mentioned, the old woman, all alacrity, hurried out of her den, and with much courtesy showed Israel across the court, up three flights of stairs to a door in the rear of the spacious building. There she left him while Israel knocked. \"Come in,\" said a voice. And immediately Israel stood in the presence of the venerable Doctor Franklin. Wrapped in a rich dressing-gown, a fanciful present from an admiring Marchesa, curiously embroidered with algebraic figures like a conjuror\u0027s robe, and with a skull-cap of black satin on his hive of a head, the man of gravity was seated at a huge claw-footed old table, round as the zodiac. It was covered with printer papers, files of documents, rolls of manuscript, stray bits of strange models in wood and metal, odd-looking pamphlets in various languages, and all sorts of books, including many presentation-copies, embracing history, mechanics, diplomacy, agriculture, political economy, metaphysics, meteorology, and geometry. The walls had a necromantic look, hung round with barometers of different kinds, drawings of surprising inventions, wide maps of far countries in the New World, containing vast empty spaces in the middle, with the word DESERT diffusely printed there, so as to span five-and-twenty degrees of longitude with only two syllables,—which printed word, however, bore a vigorous pen-mark, in the Doctor\u0027s hand, drawn straight through it, as if in summary repeal of it; crowded topographical and trigonometrical charts of various parts of Europe; with geometrical diagrams, and endless other surprising hangings and upholstery of science. The chamber itself bore evident marks of antiquity. One part of the rough-finished wall was sadly cracked, and covered with dust, looked dim and dark. But the aged inmate, though wrinkled as well, looked neat and hale. Both wall and sage were compounded of like materials,—lime and dust; both, too, were old; but while the rude earth of the wall had no painted lustre to shed off all fadings and tarnish, and still keep fresh without, though with long eld its core decayed: the living lime and dust of the sage was frescoed with defensive bloom of his soul. The weather was warm; like some old West India hogshead on the wharf, the whole chamber buzzed with flies. But the sapient inmate sat still and cool in the midst. Absorbed in some other world of his occupations and thoughts, these insects, like daily cark and care, did not seem one whit to annoy him. It was a goodly sight to see this serene, cool and ripe old philosopher, who by sharp inquisition of man in the street, and then long meditating upon him, surrounded by all those queer old implements, charts and books, had grown at last so wondrous wise. There he sat, quite motionless among those restless flies; and, with a sound like the low noon murmur of foliage in the woods, turning over the leaves of some ancient and tattered folio, with a binding dark and shaggy as the bark of any old oak. It seemed as if supernatural lore must needs pertain to this gravely, ruddy personage; at least far foresight, pleasant wit, and working wisdom. Old age seemed in no wise to have dulled him, but to have sharpened; just as old dinner-knives—so they be of good steel—wax keen, spear-pointed, and elastic as whale-bone with long usage. Yet though he was thus lively and vigorous to behold, spite of his seventy-two years (his exact date at that time) somehow, the incredible seniority of an antediluvian seemed his. Not the years of the calendar wholly, but also the years of sapience. His white hairs and mild brow, spoke of the future as well as the past. He seemed to be seven score years old; that is, three score and ten of prescience added to three score and ten of remembrance, makes just seven score years in all. But when Israel stepped within the chamber, he lost the complete effect of all this; for the sage\u0027s back, not his face, was turned to him. So, intent on his errand, hurried and heated with his recent run, our courier entered the room, inadequately impressed, for the time, by either it or its occupant. \"Bon jour, bon jour, monsieur,\" said the man of wisdom, in a cheerful voice, but too busy to turn round just then. \"How do you do, Doctor Franklin?\" said Israel. \"Ah! I smell Indian corn,\" said the Doctor, turning round quickly on his chair. \"A countryman; sit down, my good sir. Well, what news? Special?\" \"Wait a minute, sir,\" said Israel, stepping across the room towards a chair. Now there was no carpet on the floor, which was of dark-colored wood, set in lozenges, and slippery with wax, after the usual French style. As Israel walked this slippery floor, his unaccustomed feet slid about very strangely as if walking on ice, so that he came very near falling. \"\u0027Pears to me you have rather high heels to your boots,\" said the grave man of utility, looking sharply down through his spectacles; \"don\u0027t you know that it\u0027s both wasting leather and endangering your limbs, to wear such high heels? I have thought, at my first leisure, to write a little pamphlet against that very abuse. But pray, what are you doing now? Do your boots pinch you, my friend, that you lift one foot from the floor that way?\" At this moment, Israel having seated himself, was just putting his right foot across his left knee. \"How foolish,\" continued the wise man, \"for a rational creature to wear tight boots. Had nature intended rational creatures should do so, she would have made the foot of solid bone, or perhaps of solid iron, instead of bone, muscle, and flesh,—But,—I see. Hold!\" And springing to his own slippered feet, the venerable sage hurried to the door and shot-to the bolt. Then drawing the curtain carefully across the window looking out across the court to various windows on the opposite side, bade Israel proceed with his operations. \"I was mistaken this time,\" added the Doctor, smiling, as Israel produced his documents from their curious recesses—\"your high heels, instead of being idle vanities, seem to be full of meaning.\" \"Pretty full, Doctor,\" said Israel, now handing over the papers. \"I had a narrow escape with them just now.\" \"How? How\u0027s that?\" said the sage, fumbling the papers eagerly. \"Why, crossing the stone bridge there over the Seen\"— \"Seine\"—interrupted the Doctor, giving the French pronunciation.—\"Always get a new word right in the first place, my friend, and you will never get it wrong afterwards.\" \"Well, I was crossing the bridge there, and who should hail me, but a suspicious-looking man, who, under pretence of seeking to polish my boots, wanted slyly to unscrew their heels, and so steal all these precious papers I\u0027ve brought you.\" \"My good friend,\" said the man of gravity, glancing scrutinizingly upon his guest, \"have you not in your time, undergone what they call hard times? Been set upon, and persecuted, and very illy entreated by some of your fellow-creatures?\" \"That I have, Doctor; yes, indeed.\" \"I thought so. Sad usage has made you sadly suspicious, my honest friend. An indiscriminate distrust of human nature is the worst consequence of a miserable condition, whether brought about by innocence or guilt. And though want of suspicion more than want of sense, sometimes leads a man into harm, yet too much suspicion is as bad as too little sense. The man you met, my friend, most probably had no artful intention; he knew just nothing about you or your heels; he simply wanted to earn two sous by brushing your boots. Those blacking-men regularly station themselves on the bridge.\" \"How sorry I am then that I knocked over his box, and then ran away. But he didn\u0027t catch me.\" \"How? surely, my honest friend, you—appointed to the conveyance of important secret dispatches—did not act so imprudently as to kick over an innocent man\u0027s box in the public streets of the capital, to which you had been especially sent?\" \"Yes, I did, Doctor.\" \"Never act so unwisely again. If the police had got hold of you, think of what might have ensued.\" \"Well, it was not very wise of me, that\u0027s a fact, Doctor. But, you see, I thought he meant mischief.\" \"And because you only thought he meant mischief, you must straightway proceed to do mischief. That\u0027s poor logic. But think over what I have told you now, while I look over these papers.\" In half an hour\u0027s time, the Doctor, laying down the documents, again turned towards Israel, and removing his spectacles very placidly, proceeded in the kindest and most familiar manner to read him a paternal detailed lesson upon the ill-advised act he had been guilty of, upon the Pont Neuf; concluding by taking out his purse, and putting three small silver coins into Israel\u0027s hands, charging him to seek out the man that very day, and make both apology and restitution for his unlucky mistake. \"All of us, my honest friend,\" continued the Doctor, \"are subject to making mistakes; so that the chief art of life, is to learn how best to remedy mistakes. Now one remedy for mistakes is honesty. So pay the man for the damage done to his box. And now, who are you, my friend? My correspondents here mention your name—Israel Potter—and say you are an American, an escaped prisoner of war, but nothing further. I want to hear your story from your own lips.\" Israel immediately began, and related to the Doctor all his adventures up to the present time. \"I suppose,\" said the Doctor, upon Israel\u0027s concluding, \"that you desire to return to your friends across the sea?\" \"That I do, Doctor,\" said Israel. \"Well, I think I shall be able to procure you a passage.\" Israel\u0027s eyes sparkled with delight. The mild sage noticed it, and added: \"But events in these times are uncertain. At the prospect of pleasure never be elated; but, without depression, respect the omens of ill. So much my life has taught me, my honest friend.\" Israel felt as though a plum-pudding had been thrust under his nostrils, and then as rapidly withdrawn. \"I think it is probable that in two or three days I shall want you to return with some papers to the persons who sent you to me. In that case you will have to come here once more, and then, my good friend, we will see what can be done towards getting you safely home again.\" Israel was pouring out torrents of thanks when the Doctor interrupted him. \"Gratitude, my friend, cannot be too much towards God, but towards man, it should be limited. No man can possibly so serve his fellow, as to merit unbounded gratitude. Over gratitude in the helped person, is apt to breed vanity or arrogance in the helping one. Now in assisting you to get home—if indeed I shall prove able to do so—I shall be simply doing part of my official duty as agent of our common country. So you owe me just nothing at all, but the sum of these coins I put in your hand just now. But that, instead of repaying to me hereafter, you can, when you get home, give to the first soldier\u0027s widow you meet. Don\u0027t forget it, for it is a debt, a pecuniary liability, owing to me. It will be about a quarter of a dollar, in the Yankee currency. A quarter of a dollar, mind. My honest friend, in pecuniary matters always be exact as a second-hand; never mind with whom it is, father or stranger, peasant or king, be exact to a tick of your honor.\" \"Well, Doctor,\" said Israel, \"since exactness in these matters is so necessary, let me pay back my debt in the very coins in which it was loaned. There will be no chance of mistake then. Thanks to my Brentford friends, I have enough to spare of my own, to settle damages with the boot-black of the bridge. I only took the money from you, because I thought it would not look well to push it back after being so kindly offered.\" \"My honest friend,\" said the Doctor, \"I like your straightforward dealing. I will receive back the money.\" \"No interest, Doctor, I hope,\" said Israel. The sage looked mildly over his spectacles upon Israel and replied: \"My good friend, never permit yourself to be jocose upon pecuniary matters. Never joke at funerals, or during business transactions. The affair between us two, you perhaps deem very trivial, but trifles may involve momentous principles. But no more at present. You had better go immediately and find the boot-black. Having settled with him, return hither, and you will find a room ready for you near this, where you will stay during your sojourn in Paris.\" \"But I thought I would like to have a little look round the town, before I go back to England,\" said Israel. \"Business before pleasure, my friend. You must absolutely remain in your room, just as if you were my prisoner, until you quit Paris for Calais. Not knowing now at what instant I shall want you to start, your keeping to your room is indispensable. But when you come back from Brentford again, then, if nothing happens, you will have a chance to survey this celebrated capital ere taking ship for America. Now go directly, and pay the boot-black. Stop, have you the exact change ready? Don\u0027t be taking out all your money in the open street.\" \"Doctor,\" said Israel, \"I am not so simple.\" \"But you knocked over the box.\" \"That, Doctor, was bravery.\" \"Bravery in a poor cause, is the height of simplicity, my friend.—Count out your change. It must be French coin, not English, that you are to pay the man with.—Ah, that will do—those three coins will be enough. Put them in a pocket separate from your other cash. Now go, and hasten to the bridge.\" \"Shall I stop to take a meal anywhere, Doctor, as I return? I saw several cookshops as I came hither.\" \"Cafes and restaurants, they are called here, my honest friend. Tell me, are you the possessor of a liberal fortune?\" \"Not very liberal,\" said Israel. \"I thought as much. Where little wine is drunk, it is good to dine out occasionally at a friend\u0027s; but where a poor man dines out at his own charge, it is bad policy. Never dine out that way, when you can dine in. Do not stop on the way at all, my honest friend, but come directly back hither, and you shall dine at home, free of cost, with me.\" \"Thank you very kindly, Doctor.\" And Israel departed for the Pont Neuf. Succeeding in his errand thither, he returned to Dr. Franklin, and found that worthy envoy waiting his attendance at a meal, which, according to the Doctor\u0027s custom, had been sent from a neighboring restaurant. There were two covers; and without attendance the host and guest sat down. There was only one principal dish, lamb boiled with green peas. Bread and potatoes made up the rest. A decanter-like bottle of uncolored glass, filled with some uncolored beverage, stood at the venerable envoy\u0027s elbow. \"Let me fill your glass,\" said the sage. \"It\u0027s white wine, ain\u0027t it?\" said Israel. \"White wine of the very oldest brand; I drink your health in it, my honest friend.\" \"Why, it\u0027s plain water,\" said Israel, now tasting it. \"Plain water is a very good drink for plain men,\" replied the wise man. \"Yes,\" said Israel, \"but Squire Woodcock gave me perry, and the other gentleman at White Waltham gave me port, and some other friends have given me brandy.\" \"Very good, my honest friend; if you like perry and port and brandy, wait till you get back to Squire Woodcock, and the gentleman at White Waltham, and the other friends, and you shall drink perry and port and brandy. But while you are with me, you will drink plain water.\" \"So it seems, Doctor.\" \"What do you suppose a glass of port costs?\" \"About three pence English, Doctor.\" \"That must be poor port. But how much good bread will three pence English purchase?\" \"Three penny rolls, Doctor.\" \"How many glasses of port do you suppose a man may drink at a meal?\" \"The gentleman at White Waltham drank a bottle at a dinner.\" \"A bottle contains just thirteen glasses—that\u0027s thirty-nine pence, supposing it poor wine. If something of the best, which is the only sort any sane man should drink, as being the least poisonous, it would be quadruple that sum, which is one hundred and fifty-six pence, which is seventy-eight two-penny loaves. Now, do you not think that for one man to swallow down seventy-two two-penny rolls at one meal is rather extravagant business?\" \"But he drank a bottle of wine; he did not eat seventy-two two-penny rolls, Doctor.\" \"He drank the money worth of seventy-two loaves, which is drinking the loaves themselves; for money is bread.\" \"But he has plenty of money to spare, Doctor.\" \"To have to spare, is to have to give away. Does the gentleman give much away?\" \"Not that I know of, Doctor.\" \"Then he thinks he has nothing to spare; and thinking he has nothing to spare, and yet prodigally drinking down his money as he does every day, it seems to me that that gentleman stands self- contradicted, and therefore is no good example for plain sensible folks like you and me to follow. My honest friend, if you are poor, avoid wine as a costly luxury; if you are rich, shun it as a fatal indulgence. Stick to plain water. And now, my good friend, if you are through with your meal, we will rise. There is no pastry coming. Pastry is poisoned bread. Never eat pastry. Be a plain man, and stick to plain things. Now, my friend, I shall have to be private until nine o\u0027clock in the evening, when I shall be again at your service. Meantime you may go to your room. I have ordered the one next to this to be prepared for you. But you must not be idle. Here is Poor Richard\u0027s Almanac, which, in view of our late conversation, I commend to your earnest perusal. And here, too, is a Guide to Paris, an English one, which you can read. Study it well, so that when you come back from England, if you should then have an opportunity to travel about Paris, to see its wonders, you will have all the chief places made historically familiar to you. In this world, men must provide knowledge before it is wanted, just as our countrymen in New England get in their winter\u0027s fuel one season, to serve them the next.\" So saying, this homely sage, and household Plato, showed his humble guest to the door, and standing in the hall, pointed out to him the one which opened into his allotted apartment. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2836/78405.html","bookId":1225,"book":{"id":1225,"title":"Israel Potter","description":"简介： Biography, in its purer form, confined to the ended lives of the true and brave, may be held the fairest meed of human virtueone given and received in entire disinterestednesssince neither can the biographer hope for acknowledgment from the subject,...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2836","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:39 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:39 AM"}}
