{"id":34524,"no":22,"title":"CHAPTER XXI.","content":"SAMSON AMONG THE PHILISTINES. At length, as the ship, gliding on past three or four vessels at anchor in the roadstead—one, a man-of-war just furling her sails—came nigh Falmouth town, Israel, from his perch, saw crowds in violent commotion on the shore, while the adjacent roofs were covered with sightseers. A large man-of-war cutter was just landing its occupants, among whom were a corporal\u0027s guard and three officers, besides the naval lieutenant and boat\u0027s crew. Some of this company having landed, and formed a sort of lane among the mob, two trim soldiers, armed to the teeth, rose in the stern-sheets; and between them, a martial man of Patagonian stature, their ragged and handcuffed captive, whose defiant head overshadowed theirs, as St. Paul\u0027s dome its inferior steeples. Immediately the mob raised a shout, pressing in curiosity towards the colossal stranger; so that, drawing their swords, four of the soldiers had to force a passage for their comrades, who followed on, conducting the giant. As the letter of marque drew still nigher, Israel heard the officer in command of the party ashore shouting, \"To the castle! to the castle!\" and so, surrounded by shouting throngs, the company moved on, preceded by the three drawn swords, ever and anon flourished at the rioters, towards a large grim pile on a cliff about a mile from the landing. Long as they were in sight, the bulky form of the captive was seen at times swayingly towering over the flashing bayonets and cutlasses, like a great whale breaching amid a hostile retinue of sword-fish. Now and then, too, with barbaric scorn, he taunted them with cramped gestures of his manacled hands. When at last the vessel had gained her anchorage, opposite a distant detached warehouse, all was still; and the work of breaking out in the hold immediately commencing, and continuing till nightfall, absorbed all further attention for the present. Next day was Sunday; and about noon Israel, with others, was allowed to go ashore for a stroll. The town was quiet. Seeing nothing very interesting there, he passed out, alone, into the fields alongshore, and presently found himself climbing the cliff whereon stood the grim pile before spoken of. \"What place is yon?\" he asked of a rustic passing. \"Pendennis Castle.\" As he stepped upon the short crisp sward under its walls, he started at a violent sound from within, as of the roar of some tormented lion. Soon the sound became articulate, and he heard the following words bayed out with an amazing vigor: \"Brag no more, Old England; consider you are but an island! Order back your broken battalions! home, and repent in ashes! Long enough have your hired tories across the sea forgotten the Lord their God, and bowed down to Howe and Kniphausen—the Hessian!—Hands off, red-skinned jackal! Wearing the king\u0027s plate,[A] as I do, I have treasures of wrath against you British.\" A [ Meaning, probably, certain manacles.] Then came a clanking, as of a chain; many vengeful sounds, all confusedly together; with strugglings. Then again the voice: \"Ye brought me out here, from my dungeon to this green—affronting yon Sabbath sun—to see how a rebel looks. But I show ye how a true gentleman and Christian can conduct in adversity. Back, dogs! Respect a gentleman and a Christian, though he be in rags and smell of bilge-water.\" Filled with astonishment at these words, which came from over a massive wall, enclosing what seemed an open parade-space, Israel pressed forward, and soon came to a black archway, leading far within, underneath, to a grassy tract, through a tower. Like two boar\u0027s tusks, two sentries stood on guard at either side of the open jaws of the arch. Scrutinizing our adventurer a moment, they signed him permission to enter. Arrived at the end of the arched-way, where the sun shone, Israel stood transfixed, at the scene. Like some baited bull in the ring, crouched the Patagonian-looking captive, handcuffed as before; the grass of the green trampled, and gored up all about him, both by his own movements and those of the people around. Except some soldiers and sailors, these seemed mostly townspeople, collected here out of curiosity. The stranger was outlandishly arrayed in the sorry remains of a half-Indian, half-Canadian sort of a dress, consisting of a fawn-skin jacket—the fur outside and hanging in ragged tufts—a half-rotten, bark-like belt of wampum; aged breeches of sagathy; bedarned worsted stockings to the knee; old moccasins riddled with holes, their metal tags yellow with salt-water rust; a faded red woollen bonnet, not unlike a Russian night-cap, or a portentous, ensanguined full- moon, all soiled, and stuck about with bits of half-rotted straw. He seemed just broken from the dead leases in David\u0027s outlawed Cave of Adullam. Unshaven, beard and hair matted, and profuse as a corn-field beaten down by hailstorms, his whole marred aspect was that of some wild beast; but of a royal sort, and unsubdued by the cage. \"Aye, stare, stare! Though but last night dragged out of a ship\u0027s hold, like a smutty tierce; and this morning out of your littered barracks here, like a murderer; for all that, you may well stare at Ethan Ticonderoga Allen, the unconquered soldier, by ——! You Turks never saw a Christian before. Stare on! I am he, who, when your Lord Howe wanted to bribe a patriot to fall down and worship him by an offer of a major-generalship and five thousand acres of choice land in old Vermont—(Ha! three-times-three for glorious old Vermont, and my Green-Mountain boys! Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!) I am he, I say, who answered your Lord Howe, \u0027You, you offer our land? You are like the devil in Scripture, offering all the kingdoms in the world, when the d——d soul had not a corner-lot on earth! Stare on!\u0027\" \"Look you, rebel, you had best heed how you talk against General Lord Howe,\" here said a thin, wasp-waisted, epauletted officer of the castle, coming near and flourishing his sword like a schoolmaster\u0027s ferule. \"General Lord Howe? Heed how I talk of that toad-hearted king\u0027s lick-spittle of a scarlet poltroon; the vilest wriggler in God\u0027s worm-hole below? I tell you, that herds of red-haired devils are impatiently snorting to ladle Lord Howe with all his gang (you included) into the seethingest syrups of tophet\u0027s flames!\" At this blast, the wasp-waisted officer was blown backwards as from before the suddenly burst head of a steam-boiler. Staggering away, with a snapped spine, he muttered something about its being beneath his dignity to bandy further words with a low-lived rebel. \"Come, come, Colonel Allen,\" here said a mild-looking man in a sort of clerical undress, \"respect the day better than to talk thus of what lies beyond. Were you to die this hour, or what is more probable, be hung next week at Tower-wharf, you know not what might become, in eternity, of yourself.\" \"Reverend Sir,\" with a mocking bow, \"when not better employed braiding my beard, I have a little dabbled in your theologies. And let me tell you, Reverend Sir,\" lowering and intensifying his voice, \"that as to the world of spirits, of which you hint, though I know nothing of the mode or manner of that world, no more than do you, yet I expect when I shall arrive there to be treated as well as any other gentleman of my merit. That is to say, far better than you British know how to treat an American officer and meek-hearted Christian captured in honorable war, by ——! Every one tells me, as you yourself just breathed, and as, crossing the sea, every billow dinned into my ear, that I, Ethan Allen, am to be hung like a thief. If I am, the great Jehovah and the Continental Congress shall avenge me; while I, for my part, shall show you, even on the tree, how a Christian gentleman can die. Meantime, sir, if you are the clergyman you look, act out your consolatory function, by getting an unfortunate Christian gentleman about to die, a bowl of punch.\" The good-natured stranger, not to have his religious courtesy appealed to in vain, immediately dispatched his servant, who stood by, to procure the beverage. At this juncture, a faint rustling sound, as of the advance of an army with banners, was heard. Silks, scarfs, and ribbons fluttered in the background. Presently, a bright squadron of fair ladies drew nigh, escorted by certain outriding gallants of Falmouth. \"Ah,\" sighed a soft voice, \"what a strange sash, and furred vest, and what leopard-like teeth, and what flaxen hair, but all mildewed;—is that he?\" \"Yea, is it, lovely charmer,\" said Allen, like an Ottoman, bowing over his broad, bovine forehead, and breathing the words out like a lute; \"it is he—Ethan Allen, the soldier; now, since ladies\u0027 eyes visit him, made trebly a captive.\" \"Why, he talks like a beau in a parlor, this wild, mossed American from the woods,\" sighed another fair lady to her mate; \"but can this be he we came to see? I must have a lock of his hair.\" \"It is he, adorable Delilah; and fear not, even though incited by the foe, by clipping my locks, to dwindle my strength. Give me your sword, man,\" turning to an officer:—\"Ah! I\u0027m fettered. Clip it yourself, lady.\" \"No, no—I am—\" \"Afraid, would you say? Afraid of the vowed friend and champion of all ladies all round the world? Nay, nay, come hither.\" The lady advanced; and soon, overcoming her timidity, her white hand shone like whipped foam amid the matted waves of flaxen hair. \"Ah, this is like clipping tangled tags of gold-lace,\" cried she; \"but see, it is half straw.\" \"But the wearer is no man-of-straw, lady; were I free, and you had ten thousand foes—horse, foot, and dragoons—how like a friend I could fight for you! Come, you have robbed me of my hair; let me rob your dainty hand of its price. What, afraid again?\" \"No, not that; but—\" \"I see, lady; I may do it, by your leave, but not by your word; the wonted way of ladies. There, it is done. Sweeter that kiss, than the bitter heart of a cherry.\" When at length this lady left, no small talk was had by her with her companions about someway relieving the hard lot of so knightly an unfortunate. Whereupon a worthy, judicious gentleman, of middle- age, in attendance, suggested a bottle of good wine every day, and clean linen once every week. And these the gentle Englishwoman—too polite and too good to be fastidious—did indeed actually send to Ethan Allen, so long as he tarried a captive in her land. The withdrawal of this company was followed by a different scene. A perspiring man in top-boots, a riding-whip in his hand, and having the air of a prosperous farmer, brushed in, like a stray bullock, among the rest, for a peep at the giant; having just entered through the arch, as the ladies passed out. \"Hearing that the man who took Ticonderoga was here in Pendennis Castle, I\u0027ve ridden twenty-five miles to see him; and to-morrow my brother will ride forty for the same purpose. So let me have first look. Sir,\" he continued, addressing the captive, \"will you let me ask you a few plain questions, and be free with you?\" \"Be free with me? With all my heart. I love freedom of all things. I\u0027m ready to die for freedom; I expect to. So be free as you please. What is it?\" \"Then, sir, permit me to ask what is your occupation in life—in time of peace, I mean?\" \"You talk like a tax-gatherer,\" rejoined Allen, squinting diabolically at him; \"what is my occupation in life? Why, in my younger days I studied divinity, but at present I am a conjurer by profession.\" Hereupon everybody laughed, equally at the manner as the words, and the nettled farmer retorted: \"Conjurer, eh? well, you conjured wrong that time you were taken.\" \"Not so wrong, though, as you British did, that time I took Ticonderoga, my friend.\" At this juncture the servant came with the punch, when his master bade him present it to the captive. \"No!—give it me, sir, with your own hands, and pledge me as gentleman to gentleman.\" \"I cannot pledge a state-prisoner, Colonel Allen; but I will hand you the punch with my own hands, since you insist upon it.\" \"Spoken and done like a true gentleman, sir; I am bound to you.\" Then receiving the bowl into his gyved hands, the iron ringing against the china, he put it to his lips, and saying, \"I hereby give the British nation credit for half a minute\u0027s good usage,\" at one draught emptied it to the bottom. \"The rebel gulps it down like a swilling hog at a trough,\" here scoffed a lusty private of the guard, off duty. \"Shame to you!\" cried the giver of the bowl. \"Nay, sir; his red coat is a standing blush to him, as it is to the whole scarlet-blushing British army.\" Then turning derisively upon the private: \"You object to my way of taking things, do ye? I fear I shall never please ye. You objected to the way, too, in which I took Ticonderoga, and the way in which I meant to take Montreal. Selah! But pray, now that I look at you, are not you the hero I caught dodging round, in his shirt, in the cattle-pen, inside the fort? It was the break of day, you remember.\" \"Come, Yankee,\" here swore the incensed private; \"cease this, or I\u0027ll darn your old fawn-skins for ye with the flat of this sword;\" for a specimen, laying it lashwise, but not heavily, across the captive\u0027s back. Turning like a tiger, the giant, catching the steel between his teeth, wrenched it from the private\u0027s grasp, and striking it with his manacles, sent it spinning like a juggler\u0027s dagger into the air, saying, \"Lay your dirty coward\u0027s iron on a tied gentleman again, and these,\" lifting his handcuffed fists, \"shall be the beetle of mortality to you!\" The now furious soldier would have struck him with all his force, but several men of the town interposed, reminding him that it were outrageous to attack a chained captive. \"Ah,\" said Allen, \"I am accustomed to that, and therefore I am beforehand with them; and the extremity of what I say against Britain, is not meant for you, kind friends, but for my insulters, present and to come.\" Then recognizing among the interposers the giver of the bowl, he turned with a courteous bow, saying, \"Thank you again and again, my good sir; you may not be the worse for this; ours is an unstable world; so that one gentleman never knows when it may be his turn to be helped of another.\" But the soldier still making a riot, and the commotion growing general, a superior officer stepped up, who terminated the scene by remanding the prisoner to his cell, dismissing the townspeople, with all strangers, Israel among the rest, and closing the castle gates after them. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2836/78419.html","bookId":1225,"book":{"id":1225,"title":"Israel Potter","description":"简介： Biography, in its purer form, confined to the ended lives of the true and brave, may be held the fairest meed of human virtueone given and received in entire disinterestednesssince neither can the biographer hope for acknowledgment from the subject,...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2836","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:39 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:39 AM"}}
