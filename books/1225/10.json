{"id":34512,"no":10,"title":"CHAPTER IX.","content":"ISRAEL IS INITIATED INTO THE MYSTERIES OF LODGING-HOUSES IN THE LATIN QUARTER. Closing the door upon himself, Israel advanced to the middle of the chamber, and looked curiously round him. A dark tessellated floor, but without a rug; two mahogany chairs, with embroidered seats, rather the worse for wear; one mahogany bed, with a gay but tarnished counterpane; a marble wash-stand, cracked, with a china vessel of water, minus the handle. The apartment was very large; this part of the house, which was a very extensive one, embracing the four sides of a quadrangle, having, in a former age, been the hotel of a nobleman. The magnitude of the chamber made its stinted furniture look meagre enough. But in Israel\u0027s eyes, the marble mantel (a comparatively recent addition) and its appurtenances, not only redeemed the rest, but looked quite magnificent and hospitable in the extreme. Because, in the first place, the mantel was graced with an enormous old-fashioned square mirror, of heavy plate glass, set fast, like a tablet, into the wall. And in this mirror was genially reflected the following delicate articles:—first, two boquets of flowers inserted in pretty vases of porcelain; second, one cake of white soap; third, one cake of rose-colored soap (both cakes very fragrant); fourth, one wax candle; fifth, one china tinder-box; sixth, one bottle of Eau de Cologne; seventh, one paper of loaf sugar, nicely broken into sugar-bowl size; eighth, one silver teaspoon; ninth, one glass tumbler; tenth, one glass decanter of cool pure water; eleventh, one sealed bottle containing a richly hued liquid, and marked \"Otard.\" \"I wonder now what O-t-a-r-d is?\" soliloquised Israel, slowly spelling the word. \"I have a good mind to step in and ask Dr. Franklin. He knows everything. Let me smell it. No, it\u0027s sealed; smell is locked in. Those are pretty flowers. Let\u0027s smell them: no smell again. Ah, I see—sort of flowers in women\u0027s bonnets—sort of calico flowers. Beautiful soap. This smells anyhow—regular soap-roses—a white rose and a red one. That long-necked bottle there looks like a crane. I wonder what\u0027s in that? Hallo! E-a-u—d-e—C-o-l-o-g-n-e. I wonder if Dr. Franklin understands that? It looks like his white wine. This is nice sugar. Let\u0027s taste. Yes, this is very nice sugar, sweet as—yes, it\u0027s sweet as sugar; better than maple sugar, such as they make at home. But I\u0027m crunching it too loud, the Doctor will hear me. But here\u0027s a teaspoon. What\u0027s this for? There\u0027s no tea, nor tea-cup; but here\u0027s a tumbler, and here\u0027s drinking water. Let me see. Seems to me, putting this and that and the other thing together, it\u0027s a sort of alphabet that spells something. Spoon, tumbler, water, sugar,—brandy—that\u0027s it. O-t-a-r-d is brandy. Who put these things here? What does it all mean? Don\u0027t put sugar here for show, don\u0027t put a spoon here for ornament, nor a jug of water. There is only one meaning to it, and that is a very polite invitation from some invisible person to help myself, if I like, to a glass of brandy and sugar, and if I don\u0027t like, let it alone. That\u0027s my reading. I have a good mind to ask Doctor Franklin about it, though, for there\u0027s just a chance I may be mistaken, and these things here be some other person\u0027s private property, not at all meant for me to help myself from. Cologne, what\u0027s that—never mind. Soap: soap\u0027s to wash with. I want to use soap, anyway. Let me see— no, there\u0027s no soap on the wash-stand. I see, soap is not given gratis here in Paris, to boarders. But if you want it, take it from the marble, and it will be charged in the bill. If you don\u0027t want it let it alone, and no charge. Well, that\u0027s fair, anyway. But then to a man who could not afford to use soap, such beautiful cakes as these lying before his eyes all the time, would be a strong temptation. And now that I think of it, the O-t-a-r-d looks rather tempting too. But if I don\u0027t like it now, I can let it alone. I\u0027ve a good mind to try it. But it\u0027s sealed. I wonder now if I am right in my understanding of this alphabet? Who knows? I\u0027ll venture one little sip, anyhow. Come, cork. Hark!\" There was a rapid knock at the door. Clapping down the bottle, Israel said, \"Come in.\" It was the man of wisdom. \"My honest friend,\" said the Doctor, stepping with venerable briskness into the room, \"I was so busy during your visit to the Pont Neuf, that I did not have time to see that your room was all right. I merely gave the order, and heard that it had been fulfilled. But it just occurred to me, that as the landladies of Paris have some curious customs which might puzzle an entire stranger, my presence here for a moment might explain any little obscurity. Yes, it is as I thought,\" glancing towards the mantel. \"Oh, Doctor, that reminds me; what is O-t-a-r-d, pray?\" \"Otard is poison.\" \"Shocking.\" \"Yes, and I think I had best remove it from the room forthwith,\" replied the sage, in a business-like manner putting the bottle under his arm; \"I hope you never use Cologne, do you?\" \"What—what is that, Doctor?\" \"I see. You never heard of the senseless luxury—a wise ignorance. You smelt flowers upon your mountains. You won\u0027t want this, either;\" and the Cologne bottle was put under the other arm. \"Candle— you\u0027ll want that. Soap—you want soap. Use the white cake.\" \"Is that cheaper, Doctor?\" \"Yes, but just as good as the other. You don\u0027t ever munch sugar, do you? It\u0027s bad for the teeth. I\u0027ll take the sugar.\" So the paper of sugar was likewise dropped into one of the capacious coat pockets. \"Oh, you better take the whole furniture, Doctor Franklin. Here, I\u0027ll help you drag out the bedstead.\" \"My honest friend,\" said the wise man, pausing solemnly, with the two bottles, like swimmer\u0027s bladders, under his arm-pits; \"my honest friend, the bedstead you will want; what I propose to remove you will not want.\" \"Oh, I was only joking, Doctor.\" \"I knew that. It\u0027s a bad habit, except at the proper time, and with the proper person. The things left on the mantel were there placed by the landlady to be used if wanted; if not, to be left untouched. To-morrow morning, upon the chambermaid\u0027s coming in to make your bed, all such articles as remained obviously untouched would have been removed, the rest would have been charged in the bill, whether you used them up completely or not.\" \"Just as I thought. Then why not let the bottles stay, Doctor, and save yourself all this trouble?\" \"Ah! why indeed. My honest friend, are you not my guest? It were unhandsome in me to permit a third person superfluously to entertain you under what, for the time being, is my own roof.\" These words came from the wise man in the most graciously bland and flowing tones. As he ended, he made a sort of conciliatory half bow towards Israel. Charmed with his condescending affability, Israel, without another word, suffered him to march from the room, bottles and all. Not till the first impression of the venerable envoy\u0027s suavity had left him, did Israel begin to surmise the mild superiority of successful strategy which lurked beneath this highly ingratiating air. \"Ah,\" pondered Israel, sitting gloomily before the rifled mantel, with the empty tumbler and teaspoon in his hand, \"it\u0027s sad business to have a Doctor Franklin lodging in the next room. I wonder if he sees to all the boarders this way. How the O-t-a-r-d merchants must hate him, and the pastry-cooks too. I wish I had a good pie to pass the time. I wonder if they ever make pumpkin pies in Paris? So I\u0027ve got to stay in this room all the time. Somehow I\u0027m bound to be a prisoner, one way or another. Never mind, I\u0027m an ambassador; that\u0027s satisfaction. Hark! The Doctor again.—Come in.\" No venerable doctor, but in tripped a young French lass, bloom on her cheek, pink ribbons in her cap, liveliness in all her air, grace in the very tips of her elbows. The most bewitching little chambermaid in Paris. All art, but the picture of artlessness. \"Monsieur! pardon!\" \"Oh, I pardon ye freely,\" said Israel. \"Come to call on the Ambassador?\" \"Monsieur, is de—de—\" but, breaking down at the very threshold in her English, she poured out a long ribbon of sparkling French, the purpose of which was to convey a profusion of fine compliments to the stranger, with many tender inquiries as to whether he was comfortably roomed, and whether there might not be something, however trifling, wanting to his complete accommodation. But Israel understood nothing, at the time, but the exceeding grace, and trim, bewitching figure of the girl. She stood eyeing him for a few moments more, with a look of pretty theatrical despair, and, after vaguely lingering a while, with another shower of incomprehensible compliments and apologies, tripped like a fairy from the chamber. Directly she was gone Israel pondered upon a singular glance of the girl. It seemed to him that he had, by his reception, in some way, unaccountably disappointed his beautiful visitor. It struck him very strangely that she had entered all sweetness and friendliness, but had retired as if slighted, with a sort of disdainful and sarcastic levity, all the more stinging from its apparent politeness. Not long had she disappeared, when a noise in the passage apprised him that, in her hurried retreat, the girl must have stumbled against something. The next moment he heard a chair scraping in the adjacent apartment, and there was another knock at the door. It was the man of wisdom this time. \"My honest friend, did you not have a visitor, just now?\" \"Yes, Doctor, a very pretty girl called upon me.\" \"Well, I just stopped in to tell you of another strange custom of Paris. That girl is the chambermaid, but she does not confine herself altogether to one vocation. You must beware of the chambermaids of Paris, my honest friend. Shall I tell the girl, from you, that, unwilling to give her the fatigue of going up and down so many flights of stairs, you will for the future waive her visits of ceremony?\" \"Why, Doctor Franklin, she is a very sweet little girl.\" \"I know it, my honest friend; the sweeter the more dangerous. Arsenic is sweeter than sugar. I know you are a very sensible young man, not to be taken in by an artful Ammonite, and so I think I had better convey your message to the girl forthwith.\" So saying, the sage withdrew, leaving Israel once more gloomily seated before the rifled mantel, whose mirror was not again to reflect the form of the charming chambermaid. \"Every time he comes in he robs me,\" soliloquised Israel, dolefully; \"with an air all the time, too, as if he were making me presents. If he thinks me such a very sensible young man, why not let me take care of myself?\" It was growing dusk, and Israel, lighting the wax candle, proceeded to read in his Guide-book. \"This is poor sight-seeing,\" muttered he at last, \"sitting here all by myself, with no company but an empty tumbler, reading about the fine things in Paris, and I myself a prisoner in Paris. I wish something extraordinary would turn up now; for instance, a man come in and give me ten thousand pounds. But here\u0027s \u0027Poor Richard;\u0027 I am a poor fellow myself; so let\u0027s see what comfort he has for a comrade.\" Opening the little pamphlet, at random, Israel\u0027s eyes fell on the following passages: he read them aloud— \"\u0027So what signifies waiting and hoping for better times? We may make these times better, if we bestir ourselves. Industry need not wish, and he that lives upon hope will die fasting, as Poor Richard says. There are no gains, without pains. Then help hands, for I have no lands, as Poor Richard says.\u0027 Oh, confound all this wisdom! It\u0027s a sort of insulting to talk wisdom to a man like me. It\u0027s wisdom that\u0027s cheap, and it\u0027s fortune that\u0027s dear. That ain\u0027t in Poor Richard; but it ought to be,\" concluded Israel, suddenly slamming down the pamphlet. He walked across the room, looked at the artificial flowers, and the rose-colored soap, and again went to the table and took up the two books. \"So here is the \u0027Way to Wealth,\u0027 and here is the \u0027Guide to Paris.\u0027 Wonder now whether Paris lies on the Way to Wealth? if so, I am on the road. More likely though, it\u0027s a parting-of-the-ways. I shouldn\u0027t be surprised if the Doctor meant something sly by putting these two books in my hand. Somehow, the old gentleman has an amazing sly look—a sort of wild slyness—about him, seems to me. His wisdom seems a sort of sly, too. But all in honor, though. I rather think he\u0027s one of those old gentlemen who say a vast deal of sense, but hint a world more. Depend upon it, he\u0027s sly, sly, sly. Ah, what\u0027s this Poor Richard says: \u0027God helps them that help themselves:\u0027 Let\u0027s consider that. Poor Richard ain\u0027t a Dunker, that\u0027s certain, though he has lived in Pennsylvania. \u0027God helps them that help themselves.\u0027 I\u0027ll just mark that saw, and leave the pamphlet open to refer to it again—Ah!\" At this point, the Doctor knocked, summoning Israel to his own apartment. Here, after a cup of weak tea, and a little toast, the two had a long, familiar talk together; during which, Israel was delighted with the unpretending talkativeness, serene insight, and benign amiability of the sage. But, for all this, he could hardly forgive him for the Cologne and Otard depredations. Discovering that, in early life, Israel had been employed on a farm, the man of wisdom at length turned the conversation in that direction; among other things, mentioning to his guest a plan of his (the Doctor\u0027s) for yoking oxen, with a yoke to go by a spring instead of a bolt; thus greatly facilitating the operation of hitching on the team to the cart. Israel was very much struck with the improvement; and thought that, if he were home, upon his mountains, he would immediately introduce it among the farmers.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2836/78407.html","bookId":1225,"book":{"id":1225,"title":"Israel Potter","description":"简介： Biography, in its purer form, confined to the ended lives of the true and brave, may be held the fairest meed of human virtueone given and received in entire disinterestednesssince neither can the biographer hope for acknowledgment from the subject,...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2836","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:39 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:39 AM"}}
