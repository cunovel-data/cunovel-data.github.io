Next day, off Carrickfergus, on the Irish coast, a fishing boat, allured by the Quaker-like look of the incognito craft, came off in full confidence. Her men were seized, their vessel sunk. From them Paul learned that the large ship at anchor in the road, was the ship-of-war Drake, of twenty guns. Upon this he steered away, resolving to return secretly, and attack her that night. \"Surely, Captain Paul,\" said Israel to his commander, as about sunset they backed and stood in again for the land \"surely, sir, you are not going right in among them this way? Why not wait till she comes out?\" \"Because, Yellow-hair, my boy, I am engaged to marry her to-night. The bride\u0027s friends won\u0027t like the match; and so, this very night, the bride must be carried away. She has a nice tapering waist, hasn\u0027t she, through the glass? Ah! I will clasp her to my heart.\" He steered straight in like a friend; under easy sail, lounging towards the Drake, with anchor ready to drop, and grapnels to hug. But the wind was high; the anchor was not dropped at the ordered time. The ranger came to a stand three biscuits\u0027 toss off the unmisgiving enemy\u0027s quarter, like a peaceful merchantman from the Canadas, laden with harmless lumber. \"I shan\u0027t marry her just yet,\" whispered Paul, seeing his plans for the time frustrated. Gazing in audacious tranquillity upon the decks of the enemy, and amicably answering her hail, with complete self-possession, he commanded the cable to be slipped, and then, as if he had accidentally parted his anchor, turned his prow on the seaward tack, meaning to return again immediately with the same prospect of advantage possessed at first—his plan being to crash suddenly athwart the Drake\u0027s bow, so as to have all her decks exposed point-blank to his musketry. But once more the winds interposed. It came on with a storm of snow; he was obliged to give up his project. Thus, without any warlike appearance, and giving no alarm, Paul, like an invisible ghost, glided by night close to land, actually came to anchor, for an instant, within speaking-distance of an English ship-of-war; and yet came, anchored, answered hail, reconnoitered, debated, decided, and retired, without exciting the least suspicion. His purpose was chain-shot destruction. So easily may the deadliest foe—so he be but dexterous—slide, undreamed of, into human harbors or hearts. And not awakened conscience, but mere prudence, restrain such, if they vanish again without doing harm. At daybreak no soul in Carrickfergus knew that the devil, in a Scotch bonnet, had passed close that way over night. Seldom has regicidal daring been more strangely coupled with octogenarian prudence, than in many of the predatory enterprises of Paul. It is this combination of apparent incompatibilities which ranks him among extraordinary warriors. Ere daylight, the storm of the night blew over. The sun saw the Ranger lying midway over channel at the head of the Irish Sea; England, Scotland, and Ireland, with all their lofty cliffs, being as simultaneously as plainly in sight beyond the grass-green waters, as the City Hall, St. Paul\u0027s, and the Astor House, from the triangular Park in New York. The three kingdoms lay covered with snow, far as the eye could reach. \"Ah, Yellow-hair,\" said Paul, with a smile, \"they show the white flag, the cravens. And, while the white flag stays blanketing yonder heights, we\u0027ll make for Whitehaven, my boy. I promised to drop in there a moment ere quitting the country for good. Israel, lad, I mean to step ashore in person, and have a personal hand in the thing. Did you ever drive spikes?\" \"I\u0027ve driven the spike-teeth into harrows before now,\" replied Israel; \"but that was before I was a sailor.\" \"Well, then, driving spikes into harrows is a good introduction to driving spikes into cannon. You are just the man. Put down your glass; go to the carpenter, get a hundred spikes, put them in a bucket with a hammer, and bring all to me.\" As evening fell, the great promontory of St. Bee\u0027s Head, with its lighthouse, not far from Whitehaven, was in distant sight. But the wind became so light that Paul could not work his ship in close enough at an hour as early as intended. His purpose had been to make the descent and retire ere break of day. But though this intention was frustrated, he did not renounce his plan, for the present would be his last opportunity. As the night wore on, and the ship, with a very light wind, glided nigher and nigher the mark, Paul called upon Israel to produce his bucket for final inspection. Thinking some of the spikes too large, he had them filed down a little. He saw to the lanterns and combustibles. Like Peter the Great, he went into the smallest details, while still possessing a genius competent to plan the aggregate. But oversee as one may, it is impossible to guard against carelessness in subordinates. One\u0027s sharp eyes can\u0027t see behind one\u0027s back. It will yet be noted that an important omission was made in the preparations for Whitehaven. The town contained, at that period, a population of some six or seven thousand inhabitants, defended by forts. At midnight, Paul Jones, Israel Potter, and twenty-nine others, rowed in two boats to attack the six or seven thousand inhabitants of Whitehaven. There was a long way to pull. This was done in perfect silence. Not a sound was heard except the oars turning in the row-locks. Nothing was seen except the two lighthouses of the harbor. Through the stillness and the darkness, the two deep-laden boats swam into the haven, like two mysterious whales from the Arctic Sea. As they reached the outer pier, the men saw each other\u0027s faces. The day was dawning. The riggers and other artisans of the shipping would before very long be astir. No matter. The great staple exported from Whitehaven was then, and still is, coal. The town is surrounded by mines; the town is built on mines; the ships moor over mines. The mines honeycomb the land in all directions, and extend in galleries of grottoes for two miles under the sea. By the falling in of the more ancient collieries numerous houses have been swallowed, as if by an earthquake, and a consternation spread, like that of Lisbon, in 1755. So insecure and treacherous was the site of the place now about to be assailed by a desperado, nursed, like the coal, in its vitals. Now, sailing on the Thames, nigh its mouth, of fair days, when the wind is favorable for inward-bound craft, the stranger will sometimes see processions of vessels, all of similar size and rig, stretching for miles and miles, like a long string of horses tied two and two to a rope and driven to market. These are colliers going to London with coal. About three hundred of these vessels now lay, all crowded together, in one dense mob, at Whitehaven. The tide was out. They lay completely helpless, clear of water, and grounded. They were sooty in hue. Their black yards were deeply canted, like spears, to avoid collision. The three hundred grimy hulls lay wallowing in the mud, like a herd of hippopotami asleep in the alluvium of the Nile. Their sailless, raking masts, and canted yards, resembled a forest of fish-spears thrust into those same hippopotamus hides. Partly flanking one side of the grounded fleet was a fort, whose batteries were raised from the beach. On a little strip of this beach, at the base of the fort, lay a number of small rusty guns, dismounted, heaped together in disorder, as a litter of dogs. Above them projected the mounted cannon. Paul landed in his own boat at the foot of this fort. He dispatched the other boat to the north side of the haven, with orders to fire the shipping there. Leaving two men at the beach, he then proceeded to get possession of the fort. \"Hold on to the bucket, and give me your shoulder,\" said he to Israel. Using Israel for a ladder, in a trice he scaled the wall. The bucket and the men followed. He led the way softly to the guard-house, burst in, and bound the sentinels in their sleep. Then arranging his force, ordered four men to spike the cannon there. \"Now, Israel, your bucket, and follow me to the other fort.\" The two went alone about a quarter of a mile. \"Captain Paul,\" said Israel, on the way, \"can we two manage the sentinels?\" \"There are none in the fort we go to.\" \"You know all about the place, Captain?\" \"Pretty well informed on that subject, I believe. Come along. Yes, lad, I am tolerably well acquainted with Whitehaven. And this morning intend that Whitehaven shall have a slight inkling of me. Come on. Here we are.\" Scaling the walls, the two involuntarily stood for an instant gazing upon the scene. The gray light of the dawn showed the crowded houses and thronged ships with a haggard distinctness. \"Spike and hammer, lad;—so,—now follow me along, as I go, and give me a spike for every cannon. I\u0027ll tongue-tie the thunderers. Speak no more!\" and he spiked the first gun. \"Be a mute,\" and he spiked the second. \"Dumbfounder thee,\" and he spiked the third. And so, on, and on, and on, Israel following him with the bucket, like a footman, or some charitable gentleman with a basket of alms. \"There, it is done. D\u0027ye see the fire yet, lad, from the south? I don\u0027t.\" \"Not a spark, Captain. But day-sparks come on in the east.\" \"Forked flames into the hounds! What are they about? Quick, let us back to the first fort; perhaps something has happened, and they are there.\" Sure enough, on their return from spiking the cannon, Paul and Israel found the other boat back, the crew in confusion, their lantern having burnt out at the very instant they wanted it. By a singular fatality the other lantern, belonging to Paul\u0027s boat, was likewise extinguished. No tinder-box had been brought. They had no matches but sulphur matches. Locofocos were not then known. The day came on apace. \"Captain Paul,\" said the lieutenant of the second boat, \"it is madness to stay longer. See!\" and he pointed to the town, now plainly discernible in the gray light. \"Traitor, or coward!\" howled Paul, \"how came the lanterns out? Israel, my lion, now prove your blood. Get me a light—but one spark!\" \"Has any man here a bit of pipe and tobacco in his pocket?\" said Israel. A sailor quickly produced an old stump of a pipe, with tobacco. \"That will do,\" and Israel hurried away towards the town. \"What will the loon do with the pipe?\" said one. \"And where goes he?\" cried another. \"Let him alone,\" said Paul. The invader now disposed his whole force so as to retreat at an instant\u0027s warning. Meantime the hardy Israel, long experienced in all sorts of shifts and emergencies, boldly ventured to procure, from some inhabitant of Whitehaven, a spark to kindle all Whitehaven\u0027s habitations in flames. There was a lonely house standing somewhat disjointed from the town, some poor laborer\u0027s abode. Rapping at the door, Israel, pipe in mouth, begged the inmates for a light for his tobacco. \"What the devil,\" roared a voice from within, \"knock up a man this time of night to light your pipe? Begone!\" \"You are lazy this morning, my friend,\" replied Israel, \"it is daylight. Quick, give me a light. Don\u0027t you know your old friend? Shame! open the door.\" In a moment a sleepy fellow appeared, let down the bar, and Israel, stalking into the dim room, piloted himself straight to the fire-place, raked away the cinders, lighted his tobacco, and vanished. All was done in a flash. The man, stupid with sleep, had looked on bewildered. He reeled to the door, but, dodging behind a pile of bricks, Israel had already hurried himself out of sight. \"Well done, my lion,\" was the hail he received from Paul, who, during his absence, had mustered as many pipes as possible, in order to communicate and multiply the fire. Both boats now pulled to a favorable point of the principal pier of the harbor, crowded close up to a part of which lay one wing of the colliers. The men began to murmur at persisting in an attempt impossible to be concealed much longer. They were afraid to venture on board the grim colliers, and go groping down into their hulls to fire them. It seemed like a voluntary entrance into dungeons and death. \"Follow me, all of you but ten by the boats,\" said Paul, without noticing their murmurs. \"And now, to put an end to all future burnings in America, by one mighty conflagration of shipping in England. Come on, lads! Pipes and matches in the van!\" He would have distributed the men so as simultaneously to fire different ships at different points, were it not that the lateness of the hour rendered such a course insanely hazardous. Stationing his party in front of one of the windward colliers, Paul and Israel sprang on board. In a twinkling they had broken open a boatswain\u0027s locker, and, with great bunches of oakum, fine and dry as tinder, had leaped into the steerage. Here, while Paul made a blaze, Israel ran to collect the tar-pots, which being presently poured on the burning matches, oakum and wood, soon increased the flame. \"It is not a sure thing yet,\" said Paul, \"we must have a barrel of tar.\" They searched about until they found one, knocked out the head and bottom, and stood it like a martyr in the midst of the flames. They then retreated up the forward hatchway, while volumes of smoke were belched from the after one. Not till this moment did Paul hear the cries of his men, warning him that the inhabitants were not only actually astir, but crowds were on their way to the pier. As he sprang out of the smoke towards the rail of the collier, he saw the sun risen, with thousands of the people. Individuals hurried close to the burning vessel. Leaping to the ground, Paul, bidding his men stand fast, ran to their front, and, advancing about thirty feet, presented his own pistol at now tumultuous Whitehaven. Those who had rushed to extinguish what they had deemed but an accidental fire, were now paralyzed into idiotic inaction, at the defiance of the incendiary, thinking him some sudden pirate or fiend dropped down from the moon. While Paul thus stood guarding the incipient conflagration, Israel, without a weapon, dashed crazily towards the mob on the shore. \"Come back, come back,\" cried Paul. \"Not till I start these sheep, as their own wolves many a time started me!\" As he rushed bare-headed like a madman, towards the crowd, the panic spread. They fled from unarmed Israel, further than they had from the pistol of Paul. The flames now catching the rigging and spiralling around the masts, the whole ship burned at one end of the harbor, while the sun, an hour high, burned at the other. Alarm and amazement, not sleep, now ruled the world. It was time to retreat. They re-embarked without opposition, first releasing a few prisoners, as the boats could not carry them. Just as Israel was leaping into the boat, he saw the man at whose house he had procured the fire, staring like a simpleton at him. \"That was good seed you gave me;\" said Israel, \"see what a yield,\" pointing to the flames. He then dropped into the boat, leaving only Paul on the pier. The men cried to their commander, conjuring him not to linger. But Paul remained for several moments, confronting in silence the clamors of the mob beyond, and waving his solitary hand, like a disdainful tomahawk, towards the surrounding eminences, also covered with the affrighted inhabitants. When the assailants had rowed pretty well off, the English rushed in great numbers to their forts, but only to find their cannon no better than so much iron in the ore. At length, however, they began to fire, having either brought down some ship\u0027s guns, or else mounted the rusty old dogs lying at the foot of the first fort. In their eagerness they fired with no discretion. The shot fell short; they did not the slightest damage. Paul\u0027s men laughed aloud, and fired their pistols in the air. Not a splinter was made, not a drop of blood spilled throughout the affair. The intentional harmlessness of the result, as to human life, was only equalled by the desperate courage of the deed. It formed, doubtless, one feature of the compassionate contempt of Paul towards the town, that he took such paternal care of their lives and limbs. Had it been possible to have landed a few hours earlier not a ship nor a house could have escaped. But it was the lesson, not the loss, that told. As it was, enough damage had been done to demonstrate—as Paul had declared to the wise man of Paris—that the disasters caused by the wanton fires and assaults on the American coasts, could be easily brought home to the enemy\u0027s doors. Though, indeed, if the retaliators were headed by Paul Jones, the satisfaction would not be equal to the insult, being abated by the magnanimity of a chivalrous, however unprincipled a foe. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2836/78414.html","bookId":1225,"book":{"id":1225,"title":"Israel Potter","description":"简介： Biography, in its purer form, confined to the ended lives of the true and brave, may be held the fairest meed of human virtueone given and received in entire disinterestednesssince neither can the biographer hope for acknowledgment from the subject,...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2836","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:39 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:39 AM"}}
