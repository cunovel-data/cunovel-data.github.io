{"id":34521,"no":19,"title":"CHAPTER XVIII.","content":"THE EXPEDITION THAT SAILED FROM GROIX. Three months after anchoring at Brest, through Dr. Franklin\u0027s negotiations with the French king, backed by the bestirring ardor of Paul, a squadron of nine vessels, of various force, were ready in the road of Groix for another descent on the British coasts. These craft were miscellaneously picked up, their crews a mongrel pack, the officers mostly French, unacquainted with each other, and secretly jealous of Paul. The expedition was full of the elements of insubordination and failure. Much bitterness and agony resulted to a spirit like Paul\u0027s. But he bore up, and though in many particulars the sequel more than warranted his misgivings, his soul still refused to surrender. The career of this stubborn adventurer signally illustrates the idea that since all human affairs are subject to organic disorder, since they are created in and sustained by a sort of half-disciplined chaos, hence he who in great things seeks success must never wait for smooth water, which never was and never will be, but, with what straggling method he can, dash with all his derangements at his object, leaving the rest to Fortune. Though nominally commander of the squadron, Paul was not so in effect. Most of his captains conceitedly claimed independent commands. One of them in the end proved a traitor outright; few of the rest were reliable. As for the ships, that commanded by Paul in person will be a good example of the fleet. She was an old Indiaman, clumsy and crank, smelling strongly of the savor of tea, cloves, and arrack, the cargoes of former voyages. Even at that day she was, from her venerable grotesqueness, what a cocked hat is, at the present age, among ordinary beavers. Her elephantine bulk was houdahed with a castellated poop like the leaning tower of Pisa. Poor Israel, standing on the top of this poop, spy-glass at his eye, looked more an astronomer than a mariner, having to do, not with the mountains of the billows, but the mountains in the moon. Galileo on Fiesole. She was originally a single-decked ship, that is, carried her armament on one gun-deck; but cutting ports below, in her after part, Paul rammed out there six old eighteen-pounders, whose rusty muzzles peered just above the water-line, like a parcel of dirty mulattoes from a cellar-way. Her name was the Duras, but, ere sailing, it was changed to that other appellation, whereby this sad old hulk became afterwards immortal. Though it is not unknown, that a compliment to Doctor Franklin was involved in this change of titles, yet the secret history of the affair will now for the first time be disclosed. It was evening in the road of Groix. After a fagging day\u0027s work, trying to conciliate the hostile jealousy of his officers, and provide, in the face of endless obstacles (for he had to dance attendance on scores of intriguing factors and brokers ashore), the requisite stores for the fleet, Paul sat in his cabin in a half-despondent reverie, while Israel, cross-legged at his commander\u0027s feet, was patching up some old signals. \"Captain Paul, I don\u0027t like our ship\u0027s name.—Duras? What\u0027s that mean?—Duras? Being cribbed up in a ship named Duras! a sort of makes one feel as if he were in durance vile.\" \"Gad, I never thought of that before, my lion. Duras—Durance vile. I suppose it\u0027s superstition, but I\u0027ll change Come, Yellow-mane, what shall we call her?\" \"Well, Captain Paul, don\u0027t you like Doctor Franklin? Hasn\u0027t he been the prime man to get this fleet together? Let\u0027s call her the Doctor Franklin.\" \"Oh, no, that will too publicly declare him just at present; and Poor Richard wants to be a little shady in this business.\" \"Poor Richard!—call her Poor Richard, then,\" cried Israel, suddenly struck by the idea. \"\u0027Gad, you have it,\" answered Paul, springing to his feet, as all trace of his former despondency left him;—\"Poor Richard shall be the name, in honor to the saying, that \u0027God helps them that help themselves,\u0027 as Poor Richard says.\" Now this was the way the craft came to be called the Bon Homme Richard; for it being deemed advisable to have a French rendering of the new title, it assumed the above form. A few days after, the force sailed. Ere long, they captured several vessels; but the captains of the squadron proving refractory, events took so deplorable a turn, that Paul, for the present, was obliged to return to Groix. Luckily, however, at this junction a cartel arrived from England with upwards of a hundred exchanged American seamen, who almost to a man enlisted under the flag of Paul. Upon the resailing of the force, the old troubles broke out afresh. Most of her consorts insubordinately separated from the Bon Homme Richard. At length Paul found himself in violent storms beating off the rugged southeastern coast of Scotland, with only two accompanying ships. But neither the mutiny of his fleet, nor the chaos of the elements, made him falter in his purpose. Nay, at this crisis, he projected the most daring of all his descents. The Cheviot Hills were in sight. Sundry vessels had been described bound in for the Firth of Forth, on whose south shore, well up the Firth, stands Leith, the port of Edinburgh, distant but a mile or two from that capital. He resolved to dash at Leith, and lay it under contribution or in ashes. He called the captains of his two remaining consorts on board his own ship to arrange details. Those worthies had much of fastidious remark to make against the plan. After losing much time in trying to bring to a conclusion their sage deliberations, Paul, by addressing their cupidity, achieved that which all appeals to their gallantry could not accomplish. He proclaimed the grand prize of the Leith lottery at no less a figure than ￡200,000, that being named as the ransom. Enough: the three ships enter the Firth, boldly and freely, as if carrying Quakers to a Peace-Congress. Along both startled shores the panic of their approach spread like the cholera. The three suspicious crafts had so long lain off and on, that none doubted they were led by the audacious viking, Paul Jones. At five o\u0027clock, on the following morning, they were distinctly seen from the capital of Scotland, quietly sailing up the bay. Batteries were hastily thrown up at Leith, arms were obtained from the castle at Edinburgh, alarm fires were kindled in all directions. Yet with such tranquillity of effrontery did Paul conduct his ships, concealing as much as possible their warlike character, that more than once his vessels were mistaken for merchantmen, and hailed by passing ships as such. In the afternoon, Israel, at his station on the tower of Pisa, reported a boat with five men coming off to the Richard from the coast of Fife. \"They have hot oat-cakes for us,\" said Paul; \"let \u0027em come. To encourage them, show them the English ensign, Israel, my lad.\" Soon the boat was alongside. \"Well, my good fellows, what can I do for you this afternoon?\" said Paul, leaning over the side with a patronizing air. \"Why, captain, we come from the Laird of Crokarky, who wants some powder and ball for his money.\" \"What would you with powder and ball, pray?\" \"Oh! haven\u0027t you heard that that bloody pirate, Paul Jones, is somewhere hanging round the coasts?\" \"Aye, indeed, but he won\u0027t hurt you. He\u0027s only going round among the nations, with his old hat, taking up contributions. So, away with ye; ye don\u0027t want any powder and ball to give him. He wants contributions of silver, not lead. Prepare yourselves with silver, I say.\" \"Nay, captain, the Laird ordered us not to return without powder and ball. See, here is the price. It may be the taking of the bloody pirate, if you let us have what we want.\" \"Well, pass \u0027em over a keg,\" said Paul, laughing, but modifying his order by a sly whisper to Israel: \"Oh, put up your price, it\u0027s a gift to ye.\" \"But ball, captain; what\u0027s the use of powder without ball?\" roared one of the fellows from the boat\u0027s bow, as the keg was lowered in. \"We want ball.\" \"Bless my soul, you bawl loud enough as it is. Away with ye, with what you have. Look to your keg, and hark ye, if ye catch that villain, Paul Jones, give him no quarter.\" \"But, captain, here,\" shouted one of the boatmen, \"there\u0027s a mistake. This is a keg of pickles, not powder. Look,\" and poking into the bung-hole, he dragged out a green cucumber dripping with brine. \"Take this back, and give us the powder.\" \"Pooh,\" said Paul, \"the powder is at the bottom, pickled powder, best way to keep it. Away with ye, now, and after that bloody embezzler, Paul Jones.\" This was Sunday. The ships held on. During the afternoon, a long tack of the Richard brought her close towards the shores of Fife, near the thriving little port of Kirkaldy. \"There\u0027s a great crowd on the beach. Captain Paul,\" said Israel, looking through his glass. \"There seems to be an old woman standing on a fish-barrel there, a sort of selling things at auction to the people, but I can\u0027t be certain yet.\" \"Let me see,\" said Paul, taking the glass as they came nigher. \"Sure enough, it\u0027s an old lady—an old quack-doctress, seems to me, in a black gown, too. I must hail her.\" Ordering the ship to be kept on towards the port, he shortened sail within easy distance, so as to glide slowly by, and seizing the trumpet, thus spoke: \"Old lady, ahoy! What are you talking about? What\u0027s your text?\" \"The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance. He shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.\" \"Ah, what a lack of charity. Now hear mine:—God helpeth them that help themselves, as Poor Richard says.\" \"Reprobate pirate, a gale shall yet come to drive thee in wrecks from our waters.\" \"The strong wind of your hate fills my sails well. Adieu,\" waving his bonnet—\"tell us the rest at Leith.\" Next morning the ships were almost within cannon-shot of the town. The men to be landed were in the boats. Israel had the tiller of the foremost one, waiting for his commander to enter, when just as Paul\u0027s foot was on the gangway, a sudden squall struck all three ships, dashing the boats against them, and causing indescribable confusion. The squall ended in a violent gale. Getting his men on board with all dispatch, Paul essayed his best to withstand the fury of the wind, but it blew adversely, and with redoubled power. A ship at a distance went down beneath it. The disappointed invader was obliged to turn before the gale, and renounce his project. To this hour, on the shores of the Firth of Forth, it is the popular persuasion, that the Rev. Mr. Shirrer\u0027s (of Kirkaldy) powerful intercession was the direct cause of the elemental repulse experienced off the endangered harbor of Leith. Through the ill qualities of Paul\u0027s associate captains: their timidity, incapable of keeping pace with his daring; their jealousy, blind to his superiority to rivalship; together with the general reduction of his force, now reduced by desertion, from nine to three ships; and last of all, the enmity of seas and winds; the invader, driven, not by a fleet, but a gale, out of the Scottish water\u0027s, had the mortification in prospect of terminating a cruise, so formidable in appearance at the onset, without one added deed to sustain the reputation gained by former exploits. Nevertheless, he was not disheartened. He sought to conciliate fortune, not by despondency, but by resolution. And, as if won by his confident bearing, that fickle power suddenly went over to him from the ranks of the enemy—suddenly as plumed Marshal Ney to the stubborn standard of Napoleon from Elba, marching regenerated on Paris. In a word, luck—that\u0027s the word—shortly threw in Paul\u0027s way the great action of his life: the most extraordinary of all naval engagements; the unparalleled death-lock with the Serapis. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2836/78416.html","bookId":1225,"book":{"id":1225,"title":"Israel Potter","description":"简介： Biography, in its purer form, confined to the ended lives of the true and brave, may be held the fairest meed of human virtueone given and received in entire disinterestednesssince neither can the biographer hope for acknowledgment from the subject,...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2836","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:39 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:39 AM"}}
