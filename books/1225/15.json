{"id":34517,"no":15,"title":"CHAPTER XIV.","content":"IN WHICH ISRAEL IS SAILOR UNDER TWO FLAGS, AND IN THREE SHIPS, AND ALL IN ONE NIGHT. As running down channel at evening, Israel walked the crowded main-deck of the seventy-four, continually brushed by a thousand hurrying wayfarers, as if he were in some great street in London, jammed with artisans, just returning from their day\u0027s labor, novel and painful emotions were his. He found himself dropped into the naval mob without one friend; nay, among enemies, since his country\u0027s enemies were his own, and against the kith and kin of these very beings around him, he himself had once lifted a fatal hand. The martial bustle of a great man-of-war, on her first day out of port, was indescribably jarring to his present mood. Those sounds of the human multitude disturbing the solemn natural solitudes of the sea, mysteriously afflicted him. He murmured against that untowardness which, after condemning him to long sorrows on the land, now pursued him with added griefs on the deep. Why should a patriot, leaping for the chance again to attack the oppressor, as at Bunker Hill, now be kidnapped to fight that oppressor\u0027s battles on the endless drifts of the Bunker Hills of the billows? But like many other repiners, Israel was perhaps a little premature with upbraidings like these. Plying on between Scilly and Cape Clear, the Unprincipled—which vessel somewhat outsailed her consorts—fell in, just before dusk, with a large revenue cutter close to, and showing signals of distress. At the moment, no other sail was in sight. Cursing the necessity of pausing with a strong fair wind at a juncture like this, the officer-of-the-deck shortened sail, and hove to; hailing the cutter, to know what was the matter. As he hailed the small craft from the lofty poop of the bristling seventy-four, this lieutenant seemed standing on the top of Gibraltar, talking to some lowland peasant in a hut. The reply was, that in a sudden flaw of wind, which came nigh capsizing them, not an hour since, the cutter had lost all four foremost men by the violent jibing of a boom. She wanted help to get back to port. \"You shall have one man,\" said the officer-of-the-deck, morosely. \"Let him be a good one then, for heaven\u0027s sake,\" said he in the cutter; \"I ought to have at least two.\" During this talk, Israel\u0027s curiosity had prompted him to dart up the ladder from the main-deck, and stand right in the gangway above, looking out on the strange craft. Meantime the order had been given to drop a boat. Thinking this a favorable chance, he stationed himself so that he should be the foremost to spring into the boat; though crowds of English sailors, eager as himself for the same opportunity to escape from foreign service, clung to the chains of the as yet imperfectly disciplined man-of-war. As the two men who had been lowered in the boat hooked her, when afloat, along to the gangway, Israel dropped like a comet into the stern-sheets, stumbled forward, and seized an oar. In a moment more, all the oarsmen were in their places, and with a few strokes the boat lay alongside the cutter. \"Take which of them you please,\" said the lieutenant in command, addressing the officer in the revenue-cutter, and motioning with his hand to his boat\u0027s crew, as if they were a parcel of carcasses of mutton, of which the first pick was offered to some customer. \"Quick and choose. Sit down, men\"—to the sailors. \"Oh, you are in a great hurry to get rid of the king\u0027s service, ain\u0027t you? Brave chaps indeed!—Have you chosen your man?\" All this while the ten faces of the anxious oarsmen looked with mute longings and appealings towards the officer of the cutter; every face turned at the same angle, as if managed by one machine. And so they were. One motive. \"I take the freckled chap with the yellow hair—him,\" pointing to Israel. Nine of the upturned faces fell in sullen despair, and ere Israel could spring to his feet, he felt a violent thrust in his rear from the toes of one of the disappointed behind him. \"Jump, dobbin!\" cried the officer of the boat. But Israel was already on board. Another moment, and the boat and cutter parted. Ere long, night fell, and the man-of-war and her consorts were out of sight. The revenue vessel resumed her course towards the nighest port, worked by but four men: the captain, Israel, and two officers. The cabin-boy was kept at the helm. As the only foremast man, Israel was put to it pretty hard. Where there is but one man to three masters, woe betide that lonely slave. Besides, it was of itself severe work enough to manage the vessel thus short of hands. But to make matters still worse, the captain and his officers were ugly-tempered fellows. The one kicked, and the others cuffed Israel. Whereupon, not sugared with his recent experiences, and maddened by his present hap, Israel seeing himself alone at sea, with only three men, instead of a thousand, to contend against, plucked up a heart, knocked the captain into the lee scuppers, and in his fury was about tumbling the first-officer, a small wash of a fellow, plump overboard, when the captain, jumping to his feet, seized him by his long yellow hair, vowing he would slaughter him. Meanwhile the cutter flew foaming through the channel, as if in demoniac glee at this uproar on her imperilled deck. While the consternation was at its height, a dark body suddenly loomed at a moderate distance into view, shooting right athwart the stern of the cutter. The next moment a shot struck the water within a boat\u0027s length. \"Heave to, and send a boat on board!\" roared a voice almost as loud as the cannon. \"That\u0027s a war-ship,\" cried the captain of the revenue vessel, in alarm; \"but she ain\u0027t a countryman.\" Meantime the officers and Israel stopped the cutter\u0027s way. \"Send a boat on board, or I\u0027ll sink you,\" again came roaring from the stranger, followed by another shot, striking the water still nearer the cutter. \"For God\u0027s sake, don\u0027t cannonade us. I haven\u0027t got the crew to man a boat,\" replied the captain of the cutter. \"Who are you?\" \"Wait till I send a boat to you for that,\" replied the stranger. \"She\u0027s an enemy of some sort, that\u0027s plain,\" said the Englishman now to his officers; \"we ain\u0027t at open war with France; she\u0027s some bloodthirsty pirate or other. What d\u0027ye say, men?\" turning to his officers; \"let\u0027s outsail her, or be shot to chips. We can beat her at sailing, I know.\" With that, nothing doubting that his counsel would be heartily responded to, he ran to the braces to get the cutter before the wind, followed by one officer, while the other, for a useless bravado, hoisted the colors at the stern. But Israel stood indifferent, or rather all in a fever of conflicting emotions. He thought he recognized the voice from the strange vessel. \"Come, what do ye standing there, fool? Spring to the ropes here!\" cried the furious captain. But Israel did not stir. Meantime the confusion on board the stranger, owing to the hurried lowering of her boat, with the cloudiness of the sky darkening the misty sea, united to conceal the bold manoeuvre of the cutter. She had almost gained full headway ere an oblique shot, directed by mere chance, struck her stern, tearing the upcurved head of the tiller in the hands of the cabin-boy, and killing him with the splinters. Running to the stump, the captain huzzaed, and steered the reeling ship on. Forced now to hoist back the boat ere giving chase, the stranger was dropped rapidly astern. All this while storms of maledictions were hurled on Israel. But their exertions at the ropes prevented his shipmates for the time from using personal violence. While observing their efforts, Israel could not but say to himself, \"These fellows are as brave as they are brutal.\" Soon the stranger was seen dimly wallowing along astern, crowding all sail in chase, while now and then her bow-gun, showing its red tongue, bellowed after them like a mad bull. Two more shots struck the cutter, but without materially damaging her sails, or the ropes immediately upholding them. Several of her less important stays were sundered, however, whose loose tarry ends lashed the air like scorpions. It seemed not improbable that, owing to her superior sailing, the keen cutter would yet get clear. At this juncture Israel, running towards the captain, who still held the splintered stump of the tiller, stood full before him, saying, \"I am an enemy, a Yankee, look to yourself.\" \"Help here, lads, help,\" roared the captain, \"a traitor, a traitor!\" The words were hardly out of his mouth when his voice was silenced for ever. With one prodigious heave of his whole physical force, Israel smote him over the taffrail into the sea, as if the man had fallen backwards over a teetering chair. By this time the two officers were hurrying aft. Ere meeting them midway, Israel, quick as lightning, cast off the two principal halyards, thus letting the large sails all in a tumble of canvass to the deck. Next moment one of the officers was at the helm, to prevent the cutter from capsizing by being without a steersman in such an emergency. The other officer and Israel interlocked. The battle was in the midst of the chaos of blowing canvass. Caught in a rent of the sail, the officer slipped and fell near the sharp iron edge of the hatchway. As he fell he caught Israel by the most terrible part in which mortality can be grappled. Insane with pain, Israel dashed his adversary\u0027s skull against the sharp iron. The officer\u0027s hold relaxed, but himself stiffened. Israel made for the helmsman, who as yet knew not the issue of the late tussle. He caught him round the loins, bedding his fingers like grisly claws into his flesh, and hugging him to his heart. The man\u0027s ghost, caught like a broken cork in a gurgling bottle\u0027s neck, gasped with the embrace. Loosening him suddenly, Israel hurled him from him against the bulwarks. That instant another report was heard, followed by the savage hail—\"You down sail at last, do ye? I\u0027m a good mind to sink ye for your scurvy trick. Pull down that dirty rag there, astern!\" With a loud huzza, Israel hauled down the flag with one hand, while with the other he helped the now slowly gliding craft from falling off before the wind. In a few moments a boat was alongside. As its commander stepped to the deck he stumbled against the body of the first officer, which, owing to the sudden slant of the cutter in coming to the wind, had rolled against the side near the gangway. As he came aft he heard the moan of the other officer, where he lay under the mizzen shrouds. \"What is all this?\" demanded the stranger of Israel. \"It means that I am a Yankee impressed into the king\u0027s service, and for their pains I have taken the cutter.\" Giving vent to his surprise, the officer looked narrowly at the body by the shrouds, and said, \"This man is as good as dead, but we will take him to Captain Paul as a witness in your behalf.\" \"Captain Paul?—Paul Jones?\" cried Israel. \"The same.\" \"I thought so. I thought that was his voice hailing. It was Captain Paul\u0027s voice that somehow put me up to this deed.\" \"Captain Paul is the devil for putting men up to be tigers. But where are the rest of the crew?\" \"Overboard.\" \"What?\" cried the officer; \"come on board the Ranger. Captain Paul will use you for a broadside.\" Taking the moaning man along with them, and leaving the cutter untenanted by any living soul, the boat now left her for the enemy\u0027s ship. But ere they reached it the man had expired. Standing foremost on the deck, crowded with three hundred men, as Israel climbed the side, he saw, by the light of battle-lanterns, a small, smart, brigandish-looking man, wearing a Scotch bonnet, with a gold band to it. \"You rascal,\" said this person, \"why did your paltry smack give me this chase? Where\u0027s the rest of your gang?\" \"Captain Paul,\" said Israel, \"I believe I remember you. I believe I offered you my bed in Paris some months ago. How is Poor Richard?\" \"God! Is this the courier? The Yankee courier? But how now? in an English revenue cutter?\" \"Impressed, sir; that\u0027s the way.\" \"But where\u0027s the rest of them?\" demanded Paul, turning to the officer. Thereupon the officer very briefly told Paul what Israel told him. \"Are we to sink the cutter, sir?\" said the gunner, now advancing towards Captain Paul. \"If it is to be done, now is the time. She is close under us, astern; a few guns pointed downwards will settle her like a shotted corpse.\" \"No. Let her drift into Penzance, an anonymous earnest of what the whitesquall in Paul Jones intends for the future.\" Then giving directions as to the course of the ship, with an order for himself to be called at the first glimpse of a sail, Paul took Israel down with him into his cabin. \"Tell me your story now, my yellow lion. How was it all? Don\u0027t stand, sit right down there on the transom. I\u0027m a democratic sort of sea-king. Plump on the woolsack, I say, and spin the yarn. But hold; you want some grog first.\" As Paul handed the flagon, Israel\u0027s eye fell upon his hand. \"You don\u0027t wear any rings now, Captain, I see. Left them in Paris for safety.\" \"Aye, with a certain marchioness there,\" replied Paul, with a dandyish look of sentimental conceit, which sat strangely enough on his otherwise grim and Fejee air. \"I should think rings would be somewhat inconvenient at sea,\" resumed Israel. \"On my first voyage to the West Indies, I wore a girl\u0027s ring on my middle finger here, and it wasn\u0027t long before, what with hauling wet ropes, and what not, it got a kind of grown down into the flesh, and pained me very bad, let me tell you, it hugged the finger so.\" \"And did the girl grow as close to your heart, lad?\" \"Ah, Captain, girls grow themselves off quicker than we grow them on.\" \"Some experience with the countesses as well as myself, eh? But the story; wave your yellow mane, my lion—the story.\" So Israel went on and told the story in all particulars. At its conclusion Captain Paul eyed him very earnestly. His wild, lonely heart, incapable of sympathizing with cuddled natures made humdrum by long exemption from pain, was yet drawn towards a being, who in desperation of friendlessness, something like his own, had so fiercely waged battle against tyrannical odds. \"Did you go to sea young, lad?\" \"Yes, pretty young.\" \"I went at twelve, from Whitehaven. Only so high,\" raising his hand some four feet from the deck. \"I was so small, and looked so queer in my little blue jacket, that they called me the monkey. They\u0027ll call me something else before long. Did you ever sail out of Whitehaven?\" \"No, Captain.\" \"If you had, you\u0027d have heard sad stories about me. To this hour they say there that I—bloodthirsty, coward dog that I am—flogged a sailor, one Mungo Maxwell, to death. It\u0027s a lie, by Heaven! I flogged him, for he was a mutinous scamp. But he died naturally, some time afterwards, and on board another ship. But why talk? They didn\u0027t believe the affidavits of others taken before London courts, triumphantly acquitting me; how then will they credit my interested words? If slander, however much a lie, once gets hold of a man, it will stick closer than fair fame, as black pitch sticks closer than white cream. But let \u0027em slander. I will give the slanderers matter for curses. When last I left Whitehaven, I swore never again to set foot on her pier, except, like Caesar, at Sandwich, as a foreign invader. Spring under me, good ship; on you I bound to my vengeance!\" Men with poignant feelings, buried under an air of care-free self command, are never proof to the sudden incitements of passion. Though in the main they may control themselves, yet if they but once permit the smallest vent, then they may bid adieu to all self-restraint, at least for that time. Thus with Paul on the present occasion. His sympathy with Israel had prompted this momentary ebullition. When it was gone by, he seemed not a little to regret it. But he passed it over lightly, saying, \"You see, my fine fellow, what sort of a bloody cannibal I am. Will you be a sailor of mine? A sailor of the Captain who flogged poor Mungo Maxwell to death?\" \"I will be very happy, Captain Paul, to be sailor under the man who will yet, I dare say, help flog the British nation to death.\" \"You hate \u0027em, do ye?\" \"Like snakes. For months they\u0027ve hunted me as a dog,\" half howled and half wailed Israel, at the memory of all he had suffered. \"Give me your hand, my lion; wave your wild flax again. By Heaven, you hate so well, I love ye. You shall be my confidential man; stand sentry at my cabin door; sleep in the cabin; steer my boat; keep by my side whenever I land. What do you say?\" \"I say I\u0027m glad to hear you.\" \"You are a good, brave soul. You are the first among the millions of mankind that I ever naturally took to. Come, you are tired. There, go into that state-room for to-night—it\u0027s mine. You offered me your bed in Paris.\" \"But you begged off, Captain, and so must I. Where do you sleep?\" \"Lad, I don\u0027t sleep half a night out of three. My clothes have not been off now for five days.\" \"Ah, Captain, you sleep so little and scheme so much, you will die young.\" \"I know it: I want to: I mean to. Who would live a doddered old stump? What do you think of my Scotch bonnet?\" \"It looks well on you, Captain.\" \"Do you think so? A Scotch bonnet, though, ought to look well on a Scotchman. I\u0027m such by birth. Is the gold band too much?\" \"I like the gold band, Captain. It looks something as I should think a crown might on a king.\" \"Aye?\" \"You would make a better-looking king than George III.\" \"Did you ever see that old granny? Waddles about in farthingales, and carries a peacock fan, don\u0027t he? Did you ever see him?\" \"Was as close to him as I am to you now, Captain. In Kew Gardens it was, where I worked gravelling the walks. I was all alone with him, talking for some ten minutes.\" \"By Jove, what a chance! Had I but been there! What an opportunity for kidnapping a British king, and carrying him off in a fast sailing smack to Boston, a hostage for American freedom. But what did you? Didn\u0027t you try to do something to him?\" \"I had a wicked thought or two, Captain, but I got the better of it. Besides, the king behaved handsomely towards me; yes, like a true man. God bless him for it. But it was before that, that I got the better of the wicked thought.\" \"Ah, meant to stick him, I suppose. Glad you didn\u0027t. It would have been very shabby. Never kill a king, but make him captive. He looks better as a led horse, than a dead carcass. I propose now, this trip, falling on the grounds of the Earl of Selkirk, a privy counsellor and particular private friend of George III. But I won\u0027t hurt a hair of his head. When I get him on board here, he shall lodge in my best state-room, which I mean to hang with damask for him. I shall drink wine with him, and be very friendly; take him to America, and introduce his lordship into the best circles there; only I shall have him accompanied on his calls by a sentry or two disguised as valets. For the Earl\u0027s to be on sale, mind; so much ransom; that is, the nobleman, Lord Selkirk, shall have a bodily price pinned on his coat-tail, like any slave up at auction in Charleston. But, my lad with the yellow mane, you very strangely draw out my secrets. And yet you don\u0027t talk. Your honesty is a magnet which attracts my sincerity. But I rely on your fidelity.\" \"I shall be a vice to your plans, Captain Paul. I will receive, but I won\u0027t let go, unless you alone loose the screw.\" \"Well said. To bed now; you ought to. I go on deck. Good night, ace-of-hearts.\" \"That is fitter for yourself, Captain Paul, lonely leader of the suit.\" \"Lonely? Aye, but number one cannot but be lonely, my trump.\" \"Again I give it back. Ace-of-trumps may it prove to you, Captain Paul; may it be impossible for you ever to be taken. But for me—poor deuce, a trey, that comes in your wake—any king or knave may take me, as before now the knaves have.\" \"Tut, tut, lad; never be more cheery for another than for yourself. But a fagged body fags the soul. To hammock, to hammock! while I go on deck to clap on more sail to your cradle.\" And they separated for that night. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2836/78412.html","bookId":1225,"book":{"id":1225,"title":"Israel Potter","description":"简介： Biography, in its purer form, confined to the ended lives of the true and brave, may be held the fairest meed of human virtueone given and received in entire disinterestednesssince neither can the biographer hope for acknowledgment from the subject,...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2836","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:39 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:39 AM"}}
