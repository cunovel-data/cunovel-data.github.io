What\u0027s the situation now?\" \"They\u0027ve started decelerating to match our pace when they get abreast of us,\" said Jonner, indicating the rocket flares that now appeared on the aft visual screen. The tape suddenly ran out, and the rockets\u0027 roar faded. They were in free fall again. \"Get into a spacesuit and cut that towline,\" commanded Jonner. \"We\u0027re going to make a run for it.\" \"We\u0027re not going to stay and guard The Egg?\" asked Aron, getting a suit off one of the hooks. \"No outside guns. This hulk was a supply ship. As soon as you get back in and secure the outer airlock, holler and we\u0027ll start partial acceleration. When you\u0027ve strapped down somewhere below, holler again and we\u0027ll blow the tubes.\" While Aron went below to carry out his assignment, Jonner swung the ship end-to with the gyroscopes. He prayed silently that the towline to The Egg wouldn\u0027t foul. They\u0027d have to head back toward Mars, for further acceleration in this direction would throw them, helpless, in a path toward outer space. The radio loudspeaker boomed: \"OGM ship Phobos-29 to Rebel spaceship. Stand by for boarding or get blasted.\" The Marscorp ships were within a few miles now, slowing to match the pace of the Rebel ship. The outer airlock warning light flashed red, then green again. \"Ready!\" said Aron\u0027s voice on the ship\u0027s communicator. Jonner flicked his radio transmitter to the Marscorp beam. \"Go to hell!\" he announced, and depressed the firing buttons.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/3274/89550.html","bookId":408,"book":{"id":408,"title":"A Case of Sunburn","description":"简介： Jonner\u0027s hand dropped to his pistol and he edged cautiously behind a big rock as another groundcar appeared among the dunes to the south and approached the little group of men.
