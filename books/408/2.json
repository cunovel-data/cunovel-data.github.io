{"id":22708,"no":2,"title":"CHAPTER 2","content":"Jonner could not check with Sir Stanrich by radio—Mars City was too close, and they would be overheard. He had no time to spend investigating his personnel—Sir Stanrich had impressed on him that their mission must be carried out on schedule. He decided he would not tell them just yet that one of them could not be trusted. He might be able to trip the spy. But he said: \"One or more of us may be killed or captured, so I\u0027m going to brief everyone. No matter how many of us are lost, those who are left must carry out the mission. What were you told about this?\" \"I was told to meet you here and follow your instructions. I was told it\u0027s a dangerous and important assignment. That\u0027s all,\" said Tyruss. The others murmured agreement. \"The instructions I give you won\u0027t be mine, but those of Sir Stanrich O\u0027Kellin, supreme commander of the Rebel forces,\" said Jonner. He squatted on the sand and the others crowded around in the blue twilight as he sketched diagrams with his gloved hand while he talked: \"As some of you may have learned, the Charax Rebellion is in danger of collapsing, because our supplies have been running out since Marscorp intercepted and destroyed our last space fleet from Earth. Plan Red, which was our master plan for defeating Marscorp in the field by capturing the dome-cities one by one, has failed. Regina and Charax are being evacuated because we couldn\u0027t hold them much longer anyway, and all our people are being transported around the Marscorp territory to the secret underground spaceport we established in the Isidis Desert two years ago. \"This is a temporary measure, to prepare for Plan Blue, our last-gasp emergency plan. Marscorp will no doubt find the location of the underground base by observation of the refugees, but we hope to have Plan Blue in operation before they can shift their forces from Hadriacum to the desert and break through our defenses.\" \"I\u0027ve heard rumors of this Plan Blue,\" said Farlan, a slight man with blond hair. \"What is it?\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" conceded Jonner candidly. \"I don\u0027t think anyone does but Sir Stanrich and a few of our top strategists. But our part of it is this: \"You may not know it, but we lost our last G-boat when we pulled that unsuccessful attack on Phobos early this year. We do have an old spaceship, riding in a polar orbit, that Marscorp doesn\u0027t know about, but no way to get up to it. Our job is to capture a Marscorp G-boat, get to that spaceship, capture The Egg and tow it into an Earthward orbit.\" \"The Egg?\" repeated Stein, a dark, chubby fellow. \"You mean that ovoid space station of Marscorp\u0027s with the antennae sticking out all over it? I\u0027ve seen that thing floating up there. I always wondered why we didn\u0027t blast it.\" \"Not important enough,\" said Jonner. \"It\u0027s an experimental laboratory that amplifies the magnetic field of Mars, and they\u0027ve been experimenting with it as an auxiliary power station. But neither side is bothered by any lack of power from the atomic energy sources on Mars.\" Tyruss appeared annoyed at this. \"Tell me something, Jonner,\" he demanded. \"If it wasn\u0027t important enough to blast when we had the ships to do it, why is it important enough for us to capture now?\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" said Jonner. \"Those are our orders. Now, we leave the groundcars here and go on foot to Marsport. Check equipment, everyone.\" \"Say,\" commented Farlan after a moment, \"I don\u0027t seem to have any sunburn lotion.\" \"You can have mine,\" said Aron, laughing. \"This far from the sun, I haven\u0027t been sunburned yet, and don\u0027t expect to be.\" \"Haven\u0027t been on Mars a year yet, have you?\" suggested Tyruss. \"No,\" admitted Aron. \"I came from Earth with the last space fleet and escaped in a lifeboat. Why?\" \"There\u0027s an Earth-sun conjunction coming up. Every time the Earth swings between Mars and the sun, everybody on Mars gets a bad sunburn. When it comes, you better cover yourself with lotion, because clothes don\u0027t protect you and even if you\u0027re in a city, the domes and house roofs are transparent to pick up the sun\u0027s heat.\" \"We have enough among us,\" said Jonner. \"Besides, if our mission goes off on schedule, we\u0027ll be back at base by the time the Earth-sun conjunction starts. Let\u0027s head for Marsport.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/3274/89545.html","bookId":408,"book":{"id":408,"title":"A Case of Sunburn","description":"简介： Jonner\u0027s hand dropped to his pistol and he edged cautiously behind a big rock as another groundcar appeared among the dunes to the south and approached the little group of men.
