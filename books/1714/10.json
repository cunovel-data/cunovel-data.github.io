{"id":67069,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"But Ricky was telling me this cloud had been self-sustaining for days. That just didn\u0027t make sense. \"Where is it getting power?\" He sighed. \"We built the units with a small piezo wafer to generate current from photons. It\u0027s only supplementary-we added it as an afterthought-but they seem to be managing with it alone.\" \"So the units are solar-powered,\" I said. \"Right.\" \"Whose idea was that?\" \"The Pentagon asked for it.\" \"And you built in capacitance?\" \"Yeah. They can store charge for three hours.\" \"Okay, fine,\" I said. Now we were getting somewhere. \"So they have enough power for three hours. What happens at night?\" \"At night, they presumably lose power after three hours of darkness.\" \"And then the cloud falls apart?\" \"Yes.\" \"And the individual units drop to the ground?\" \"Presumably, yes.\" \"Can\u0027t you take control of them then?\" \"We could,\" Ricky said, \"if we could find them. We go out every night, looking. But we can never find them.\" \"You\u0027ve built in markers?\" \"Yes, sure. Every single unit has a fluorescing module in the shell. They show up blue-green under UV light.\" \"So you go out at night looking for a patch of desert that glows blue-green.\" \"Right. And so far, we haven\u0027t found it.\" That didn\u0027t really surprise me. If the cloud collapsed tightly, it would form a clump about six inches in diameter on the desert floor. And it was a big desert out there. They could easily miss it, night after night. But as I thought about it, there was another aspect that didn\u0027t make sense. Once the cloud fell to the ground-once the individual units lost power-then the cloud had no organization. It could be scattered by wind, like so many dust particles, never to re-form. But evidently that didn\u0027t happen. The units didn\u0027t scatter. Instead, the cloud returned day after day. Why was that? \"We think,\" Ricky said, \"that it may hide at night.\" \"Hide?\" \"Yeah. We think it goes to some protected area, maybe an overhang, or a hole in the ground, something like that.\" I pointed to the cloud as it swirled toward us. \"You think that swarm is capable of hiding?\" \"I think it\u0027s capable of adapting. In fact, I know it is.\" He sighed. \"Anyway, it\u0027s more than just one swarm, Jack.\" \"There\u0027s more than one?\" \"There\u0027s at least three. Maybe more, by now.\" I felt a momentary blankness, a kind of sleepy gray confusion that washed over me. I suddenly couldn\u0027t think, I couldn\u0027t put it together. \"What are you saying?\" \"I\u0027m saying it reproduces, Jack,\" he said. \"The fucking swarm reproduces.\" The camera now showed a ground-level view of the dust cloud as it swirled toward us. But as I watched, I realized it wasn\u0027t swirling like a dust devil. Instead, the particles were twisting one way, then another, in a kind of sinuous movement. They were definitely swarming. \"Swarming\" was a term for the behavior of certain social insects like ants or bees, which swarmed whenever the hive moved to a new site. A cloud of bees will fly in one direction and then another, forming a dark river in the air. The swarm might halt and cling to a tree for perhaps an hour, perhaps overnight, before continuing onward. Eventually the bees settled on a new location for their hive, and stopped swarming. In recent years, programmers had written programs that modeled this insect behavior. Swarm-intelligence algorithms had become an important tool in computer programming. To programmers, a swarm meant a population of computer agents that acted together to solve a problem by distributed intelligence. Swarming became a popular way to organize agents to work together. There were professional organizations and conferences devoted entirely to swarm-intelligence programs. Lately it had become a kind of default solution-if you couldn\u0027t code anything more inventive, you made your agents swarm. But as I watched, I could see this cloud was not swarming in any ordinary sense. The sinuous back-and-forth motion seemed to be only part of its movement. There was also a rhythmic expansion and contraction, a pulse, almost like breathing. And intermittently, the cloud seemed to thin out, and rise higher, then to collapse down, and become more squat. These changes occurred continuously, but in a repeating rhythm-or rather a series of superimposed rhythms. \"Shit,\" Ricky said. \"I don\u0027t see the others. And I know it\u0027s not alone.\" He pressed the radio again. \"Vince? You see any others?\" \"No, Ricky.\" \"Where are the others? Guys? Speak to me.\" Radios crackled all over the facility. Bobby Lembeck: \"Ricky, it\u0027s alone.\" \"It can\u0027t be alone.\" Mae Chang: \"Ricky, nothing else is registering out there.\" \"Just one swarm, Ricky.\" That was David Brooks. \"It can\u0027t be alone!\" Ricky was gripping the radio so tightly his fingers were white. He pressed the button. \"Vince? Take the PPI up to seven.\" \"You sure?\" \"Do it.\" \"Well, all right, if you really think-\" \"Just skip the fucking commentary, and do it!\" Ricky was talking about increasing the positive pressure inside the building to seven pounds per square inch. All clean facilities maintained a positive pressure so that outside dust particles could not enter from any leak; they would be blown outward by the escaping air. But one or two pounds was enough to maintain that. Seven pounds of positive pressure was a lot. It was unnecessary to keep out passive particles. But of course these particles weren\u0027t passive. Watching the cloud swirl and undulate as it came closer, I saw that parts of it occasionally caught the sunlight in a way that turned it a shimmering, iridescent silver. Then the color faded, and the swarm became black again. That had to be the piezo panels catching the sun. But it clearly demonstrated that the individual microunits were highly mobile, since the entire cloud never turned silver at the same time, but only portions, or bands. \"I thought you said the Pentagon was giving up on you, because you couldn\u0027t control this swarm in wind.\" \"Right. We couldn\u0027t.\" \"But you must have had strong wind in the last few days.\" \"Of course. Usually comes up in late afternoon. We had ten knots yesterday.\" \"Why wasn\u0027t the swarm blown away?\" \"Because it\u0027s figured that one out,\" Ricky said gloomily. \"It\u0027s adapted to it.\" \"How?\" \"Keep watching, you\u0027ll probably see it. Whenever the wind gusts, the swarm sinks, hangs near the ground. Then it rises up again once the wind dies down.\" \"This is emergent behavior?\" \"Right. Nobody programmed it.\" He bit his lip. Was he lying again? \"So you\u0027re telling me it\u0027s learned ...\" \"Right, right.\" \"How can it learn? The agents have no memory.\" \"Uh ... well, that\u0027s a long story,\" Ricky said. \"They have memory?\" \"Yes, they have memory. Limited. We built it in.\" Ricky pressed the button on his radio. \"Anybody hear anything?\" The answers came back, crackling in his handset. \"Not yet.\" \"Nothing.\" \"No sounds?\" \"Not yet.\" I said to Ricky, \"It makes sounds?\" \"We\u0027re not sure. Sometimes it seems like it. We\u0027ve been trying to record it ...\" He flicked keys on the workstation, quickly shifting the monitor images, making them larger, one after another. He shook his head. \"I don\u0027t like this. That thing can\u0027t be alone,\" he said. \"I want to know where the others are.\" \"How do you know there are others?\" \"Because there always are.\" He chewed his lip tensely as he looked at the monitor. \"I wonder what it\u0027s up to now ...\" We didn\u0027t have long to wait. In a few moments, the black swarm had come within a few yards of the building. Abruptly, it divided in two, and then divided again. Now there were three swarms, swirling side by side. \"Son of a bitch,\" Ricky said. \"It was hiding the others inside itself.\" He pushed his button again. \"Guys, we got all three. And they\u0027re close.\" They were, in fact, too close to be seen by the ground-view camera. Ricky switched to the overhead views. I saw three black clouds, all moving laterally along the side of the building. The behavior seemed distinctly purposeful. \"What\u0027re they trying to do?\" I said. \"Get inside,\" Ricky said. \"Why?\" \"You\u0027d have to ask them. But yesterday one of them-\" Suddenly, from a clump of cactus near the building, a cottontail rabbit sprinted away across the desert floor. Immediately, the three swarms turned and pursued it. Ricky switched the monitor view. We now watched at ground level. The three clouds converged on the terrified bunny, which was moving fast, a whitish blur on the screen. The clouds swirled after it with surprising speed. The behavior was clear: they were hunting. I felt a moment of irrational pride. PREDPREY was working perfectly! Those swarms might as well be lionesses chasing a gazelle, so purposeful was their behavior. The swarms turned sharply, then split up, cutting off the rabbit\u0027s escape to the left and right. The behavior of the three clouds clearly appeared coordinated. Now they were closing in. And suddenly one of the swarms sank down, engulfing the rabbit. The other two swarms fell on it moments later. The resulting particle cloud was so dense, it was hard to see the rabbit anymore. Apparently it had flipped onto its back, because I saw its hind legs kicking spasmodically in the air, above the cloud itself. I said, \"They\u0027re killing it ...\" \"Yeah,\" Ricky said, nodding. \"That\u0027s right.\" \"I thought this was a camera swarm.\" \"Yeah, well.\" \"How are they killing it?\" \"We don\u0027t know, Jack. But it\u0027s fast.\" I frowned. \"So you\u0027ve seen this before?\" Ricky hesitated, bit his lip. Didn\u0027t answer me, just stared at the screen. I said, \"Ricky, you\u0027ve seen this before?\" He gave a long sigh. \"Yeah. Well, the first time was yesterday. They killed a rattlesnake yesterday.\" I thought, they killed a rattlesnake yesterday. I said, \"Jesus, Ricky.\" I thought of the men in the helicopter, talking about all the dead animals. I wondered if Ricky was telling me all he knew. \"Yeah.\" The rabbit no longer kicked. A single protruding foot trembled with small convulsions, and then was still. The cloud swirled low to the ground around the animal, rising and falling slightly. This continued for almost a minute. I said, \"What\u0027re they doing now?\" Ricky shook his head. \"I\u0027m not sure. But they did this before, too.\" \"It almost looks like they\u0027re eating it.\" \"I know,\" Ricky said. Of course that was absurd. PREDPREY was just a biological analogy. As I watched the pulsing cloud, it occurred to me that this behavior might actually represent a program hang. I couldn\u0027t remember exactly what rules we had written for individual units after the goal was attained. Real predators, of course, would eat their prey, but there was no analogous behavior for these micro-robots. So perhaps the cloud was just swirling in confusion. If so, it should start moving again soon. Usually, when a distributed-intelligence program stalled, it was a temporary phenomenon. Sooner or later, random environmental influences would cause enough units to act that they induced all the others to act, too. Then the program would start up again. The units would resume goal seeking. This behavior was roughly what you saw in a lecture hall, after the lecture was over. The audience milled around for a while, stretching, talking to people close to them, or greeting friends, collecting coats and belongings. Only a few people left at once, and the main crowd ignored them. But after a certain percentage of the audience had gone, the remaining people would stop milling and begin to leave quickly. It was a kind of focus change. If I was right, then I should see something similar in the behavior of the cloud. The swirls should lose their coordinated appearance; there should be ragged wisps of particles rising into the air. Only then would the main cloud move. I glanced at the timeclock in the corner of the monitor. \"How long has it been now?\" \"About two minutes.\" That wasn\u0027t particularly long for a stall, I thought. At one point when we were writing PREDPREY, we used the computer to simulate coordinated agent behavior. We always restarted after a hang, but finally we decided to wait and see if the program was really permanently stalled. We found that the program might hang for as long as twelve hours before suddenly kicking off, and coming back to life again. In fact, that behavior interested the neuroscientists because- \"They\u0027re starting,\" Ricky said. And they were. The swarms were beginning to rise up from the dead rabbit. I saw at once that my theory was wrong. There was no raggedness, no rising wisps. The three clouds rose up together, smoothly. The behavior seemed entirely nonrandom and controlled. The clouds swirled separately for a moment, then merged into one. Sunlight flashed on shimmering silver. The rabbit lay motionless on its side. And then the swarm moved swiftly away, whooshing off into the desert. It shrank toward the horizon. In moments, it was gone. Ricky was watching me. \"What do you think?\" \"You\u0027ve got a breakaway robotic nanoswarm. That some idiot made self-powered and self-sustaining.\" \"You think we can get it back?\" \"No,\" I said. \"From what I\u0027ve seen, there\u0027s not a chance in hell.\" Ricky sighed, and shook his head. \"But you can certainly get rid of it,\" I said. \"You can kill it.\" \"We can?\" \"Absolutely.\" \"Really?\" His face brightened. \"Absolutely.\" And I meant it. I was convinced that Ricky was overstating the problem he faced. He hadn\u0027t thought it through. He hadn\u0027t done all he could do. I was confident that I could destroy the runaway swarm quickly. I expected that I\u0027d be done with the whole business by dawn tomorrow-at the very latest. That was how little I understood my adversary. DAY 6 10:11 A.M. In retrospect, I was right about one thing: it was vitally important to know how the rabbit had died. Of course I know the reason now. I also know why the rabbit was attacked. But that first day at the laboratory, I didn\u0027t have the faintest notion of what had happened. And I could never have guessed the truth. None of us could have, at that point. Not even Ricky. Not even Julia. It was ten minutes after the swarms had gone and we were all standing in the storage room. The whole group had gathered there, tense and anxious. They watched me as I clipped a radio transmitter to my belt, and pulled a headset over my head. The headset included a video camera, mounted by my left ear. It took a while to get the video transmitter working right. Ricky said, \"You\u0027re really going out there?\" \"I am,\" I said. \"I want to know what happened to that rabbit.\" I turned to the others. \"Who\u0027s coming with me?\" Nobody moved. Bobby Lembeck stared at the floor, hands in his pockets. David Brooks blinked rapidly, and looked away. Ricky was inspecting his fingernails. I caught Rosie Castro\u0027s eye. She shook her head. \"No fucking way, Jack.\" \"Why not, Rosie?\" \"You saw it yourself. They\u0027re hunting.\" \"Are they?\" \"Sure as hell looked like it.\" \"Rosie,\" I said, \"I trained you better than this. How can the swarms be hunting?\" \"We all saw it.\" She stuck her chin out stubbornly. \"All three of the swarms, hunting, coordinated.\" \"But how?\" I said. Now she frowned, looking confused. \"What are you asking? There\u0027s no mystery. The agents can communicate. They can each generate an electrical signal.\" \"Right,\" I said. \"How big a signal?\" \"Well ...\" She shrugged. \"How big, Rosie? It can\u0027t be much, the agent is only a hundredth of the thickness of a human hair. Can\u0027t be generating much of a signal, right?\" \"True ...\" \"And electromagnetic radiation decays according to the square of the radius, right?\" Every school kid learned that fact in high school physics. As you moved away from the electromagnetic source, the strength faded fast-very fast. And what that meant was the individual agents could only communicate with their immediate neighbors, with agents very close to them. Not to other swarms twenty or thirty yards away. Rosie\u0027s frown deepened. The whole group was frowning now, looking at each other uneasily. David Brooks coughed. \"Then what did we see, Jack?\" \"You saw an illusion,\" I said firmly. \"You saw three swarms acting independently, and you thought they were coordinated. But they\u0027re not. And I\u0027m pretty certain that other things you believe about these swarms aren\u0027t true, either.\" There was a lot I didn\u0027t understand about the swarms-and a lot I didn\u0027t believe. I didn\u0027t believe, for example, that the swarms were reproducing. I thought Ricky and the others must be pretty unnerved even to imagine it. After all, the fifty pounds of material they\u0027d exhausted into the environment could easily account for the three swarms I had seen-and dozens more besides. (I was guessing that each swarm consisted of three pounds of nanoparticles. That was roughly the weight of a large bee swarm.) As for the fact that these swarms showed purposeful behavior, that was not in the least troubling; it was the intended result of low-level programming. And I didn\u0027t believe the swarms were coordinated. It simply wasn\u0027t possible, because the fields were too weak. Nor did I believe the swarms had the adaptive powers that Ricky attributed to them. I\u0027d seen too many demos of robots carrying out some task-like cooperating to push a box around the room-which was interpreted by observers as intelligent behavior, when in fact the robots were stupid, minimally programmed, and cooperating by accident. A lot of behavior looked smarter than it was. (As Charley Davenport used to say, \"Ricky should thank God for that.\") And finally, I didn\u0027t really believe that the swarms were dangerous. I didn\u0027t think that a three-pound cloud of nanoparticles could represent much of a threat to anything, not even a rabbit. I wasn\u0027t at all sure it had been killed. I seemed to recall that rabbits were nervous creatures, prone to die of fright. Or the pursuing particles might have swarmed in through the nose and mouth, blocking the respiratory passages and choking the animal to death. If so, the death was accidental, not purposeful. Accidental death made more sense to me. In short, I thought that Ricky and the others had consistently misinterpreted what they saw. They\u0027d spooked themselves. On the other hand, I had to admit that several unanswered questions nagged at me. The first, and most obvious, was why the swarm had escaped their control. The original camera swarm was designed to be controlled by an RF transmitter beaming toward it. Now apparently the swarm ignored transmitted radio commands, and I didn\u0027t understand why. I suspected an error in manufacturing. The particles had probably been made incorrectly. Second was the question of the swarm\u0027s longevity. The individual particles were extremely small, subject to damage from cosmic rays, photochemical decay, dehydration of their protein chains, and other environmental factors. In the harsh desert, all the swarms should have shriveled up and died of \"old age\" many days ago. But they hadn\u0027t. Why not? Third, there was the problem of the swarm\u0027s apparent goal. According to Ricky, the swarms kept coming back to the main building. Ricky believed they were trying to get inside. But that didn\u0027t seem to be a reasonable agent goal, and I wanted to look at the program code to see what was causing it. Frankly, I suspected a bug in the code. And finally, I wanted to know why they had pursued the rabbit. Because PREDPREY didn\u0027t program units to become literal predators. It merely used a predator model to keep the agents focused and goal-oriented. Somehow, that had changed, and the swarms now appeared to be actually hunting. That, too, was probably a bug in the code. To my mind, all these uncertainties came down to a single, central question-how had the rabbit died? I didn\u0027t think it had been killed. I suspected the rabbit\u0027s death was accidental, not purposeful. But we needed to find out. I adjusted my portable radio headset, with the sunglasses and the video camera mounted by the left eye. I picked up the plastic bag for the rabbit\u0027s body and turned to the others. \"Anybody coming with me?\" There was an uncomfortable silence. Ricky said, \"What\u0027s the bag for?\" \"To bring the rabbit back in.\" \"No fucking way,\" Ricky said. \"You want to go out there, that\u0027s your business. But you\u0027re not bringing that rabbit back here.\" \"You\u0027ve got to be kidding,\" I said. \"I\u0027m not. We run a level-six clean environment here, Jack. That rabbit\u0027s filthy. Can\u0027t come in.\" \"All right, then, we can store it in Mae\u0027s lab and-\" \"No way, Jack. Sorry. It\u0027s not coming through the first airlock.\" I looked at the others. They were all nodding their heads in agreement. \"All right, then. I\u0027ll examine it out there.\" \"You\u0027re really going to go out?\" \"Why not?\" I looked at them, one after another. \"I have to tell you guys, I think you\u0027ve all got your knickers in a twist. The cloud\u0027s not dangerous. And yes, I\u0027m going out.\" I turned to Mae. \"Do you have a dissection kit of some kind that-\" \"I\u0027ll come with you,\" she said quietly. \"Okay. Thanks.\" I was surprised that Mae was the first to come around to my way of seeing things. But as a field biologist, she was probably better than the others at assessing real-world risk. In any case, her decision seemed to break some tension in the room; the others visibly relaxed. Mae went off to get the dissecting tools and some lab equipment. That was when the phone rang. Vince answered it, and turned to me. \"You know somebody named Dr. Ellen Forman?\" \"Yes.\" It was my sister. \"She\u0027s on the line.\" Vince handed me the phone, and stepped back. I felt suddenly nervous. I glanced at my watch. It was eleven o\u0027clock in the morning, time for Amanda\u0027s morning nap. She should be asleep in her crib by now. Then I remembered I had promised my sister I would call her at eleven to check in, to see how things were going. I said, \"Hello? Ellen? Is everything all right?\" \"Sure. Fine.\" A long, long sigh. \"It\u0027s fine. I don\u0027t know how you do it, is all.\" \"Tired?\" \"About as tired as I\u0027ve ever felt.\" \"Kids get off to school okay?\" Another sigh. \"Yes. In the car, Eric hit Nicole on the back, and she punched him on the ear.\" \"You\u0027ve got to interrupt them if they start that, Ellen.\" \"So I\u0027m learning,\" she said wearily. \"And the baby? How\u0027s her rash?\" \"Better. I\u0027m using the ointment.\" \"Her movements okay?\" \"Sure. She\u0027s well coordinated for her age. Is there a problem I should know about?\" \"No, no,\" I said. I turned away from the group, lowered my voice. \"I meant, is she pooping okay?\" Behind me, I heard Charley Davenport snicker. \"Copiously,\" Ellen said. \"She\u0027s sleeping now. I took her to the park for a while. She was ready to go down. Everything\u0027s okay at the house. Except the pilot for the water heater went out, but the guy\u0027s coming to fix it.\" \"Good, good ... Listen, Ellen, I\u0027m in the middle of something here-\" \"Jack? Julia called from the hospital a few minutes ago. She was looking for you.\" \"Uh-huh ...\" \"When I said you\u0027d gone to Nevada, she got pretty upset.\" \"Is that right?\" \"She said you didn\u0027t understand. And you were going to make it worse. Something like that. I think you better call her. She sounded agitated.\" \"Okay. I\u0027ll call.\" \"How are things going out there? You be back tonight?\" \"Not tonight,\" I said. \"Sometime tomorrow morning. Ellen, I have to go now-\" \"Call the kids at dinnertime, if you can. They\u0027d like to hear from you. Auntie Ellen is fine, but she\u0027s not Dad. You know what I mean.\" \"Okay. You\u0027ll eat at six?\" \"About.\" I told her I\u0027d try to call, and I hung up. Mae and I were standing by the double glass walls of the outer airlock, just inside the building entrance. Beyond the glass, I could see the solid-steel fire door that led outside. Ricky was standing beside us, gloomy and nervous, watching as we made our final preparations. \"You sure this is necessary? To go outside?\" \"It\u0027s essential.\" \"Why don\u0027t you and Mae wait until nightfall, and go out then?\" \"Because the rabbit won\u0027t be there,\" I said. \"By nightfall, coyotes or hawks will have come and taken the carcass away.\" \"I don\u0027t know about that,\" Ricky said. \"We haven\u0027t seen any coyotes around here for a while.\" \"Oh hell,\" I said impatiently, turning on my radio headset. \"In the time we\u0027ve spent arguing about this, we could have been out and back already. See you, Ricky.\" I went through the glass door, and stood in the airlock. The door hissed shut behind me. The air handlers whooshed briefly in the now-familiar pattern, and then the far glass slid open. I walked toward the steel fire door. Looking back, I saw Mae stepping into the airlock. I opened the fire door a crack. Harsh, glaring sunlight laid a burning strip on the floor. I felt hot air on my face. Over the intercom, Ricky said, \"Good luck, guys.\" I took a breath, pushed the door wider, and stepped out into the desert. The wind had dropped, and the midmorning heat was stifling. Somewhere a bird chittered; otherwise it was silent. Standing by the door, I squinted in the glare of the sunlight. A shiver ran down my back. I took another deep breath. I was certain that the swarms were not dangerous. But now that I was outside, my theoretical inferences seemed to lose force. I must have caught Ricky\u0027s tension, because I was feeling distinctly uneasy. Now that I was outside, the rabbit carcass looked much farther away than I had imagined. It was perhaps fifty yards from the door, half the length of a football field. The surrounding desert seemed barren and exposed. I scanned the shimmering horizon, looking for black shapes. I saw none.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/prey/page-10.html","bookId":1714,"book":{"id":1714,"title":"Prey","description":"Storyline: In the Nevada desert, an experiment has gone horribly wrong.
