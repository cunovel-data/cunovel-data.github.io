Couple of hours.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe you should take a pill.\"\\n\\n \"I did. Doesn\u0027t seem to help. It\u0027s the damn pressure. I\u0027ve been here a week now. This place gets to you.\"\\n\\n \"I imagine it must.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah. Well, anyway.\" He turned away, as if suddenly embarrassed. \"Look, I\u0027ll be on the radio,\" he said. \"I\u0027ll be with you every step of the way. I\u0027m very grateful to you, Jack. You\u0027ve brought sanity and order here. Just ... just be careful out there, okay?\"\\n\\n \"I will.\"\\n\\n Ricky stepped aside.\\n\\n I went out the door past him.\\n\\n Going down the hallway to the power station, with the air conditioners roaring full blast, Mae fell into step beside me. I said to her, \"You really don\u0027t need to go out there, Mae. You could tell me over the radio how to handle the isotopes.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not the isotopes I\u0027m concerned with,\" she said, her voice low, so it would be buried in the roar. \"It\u0027s the rabbit.\"\\n\\n I wasn\u0027t sure I\u0027d heard her. \"The what?\"\\n\\n \"The rabbit. I need to examine the rabbit again.\"\\n\\n \"Why?\"\\n\\n \"You remember that tissue sample I cut from the stomach? Well, I looked at it under the microscope a few minutes ago.\"\\n\\n \"And?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m afraid we have big problems, Jack.\"\\n\\n DAY 6\\n\\n 2:52 P.M.\\n\\n I was the first one out the door, squinting in the desert sunlight. Even though it was almost three o\u0027clock, the sun seemed as bright and hot as ever. A hot wind ruffled my trousers and shirt. I pulled my headset mouthpiece closer to my lips and said, \"Bobby, you reading?\"\\n\\n \"I read you, Jack.\"\\n\\n \"Got an image?\"\\n\\n \"Yes, Jack.\"\\n\\n Charley Davenport came out and laughed. He said, \"You know, Ricky, you really are a stupid shmuck. You know that?\"\\n\\n Over my headset, I heard Ricky say, \"Save it. You know I don\u0027t like compliments. Just get on with it.\"\\n\\n Mae came through the door next. She had a backpack slung over one shoulder. She said to me, \"For the isotopes.\"\\n\\n \"Are they heavy?\"\\n\\n \"The containers are.\"\\n\\n Then David Brooks came out, with Rosie close behind him. She made a face as she stepped onto the sand. \"Jesus, it\u0027s hot,\" she said.\\n\\n \"Yeah, I think you\u0027ll find deserts tend to be that way,\" Charley said.\\n\\n \"No shit, Charley.\"\\n\\n \"I wouldn\u0027t shit you, Rosie.\" He belched.\\n\\n I was busy scanning the horizon, but I saw nothing. The cars were parked under a shed about fifty yards away. The shed ended in a square white concrete building with narrow windows. That was the storage unit.\\n\\n We started toward it. Rosie said, \"Is that place air-conditioned?\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" Mae said. \"But it\u0027s still hot. It\u0027s poorly insulated.\"\\n\\n \"Is it airtight?\" I said.\\n\\n \"Not really.\"\\n\\n \"That means no,\" Davenport said, laughing. He spoke into his headset. \"Bobby, what wind do we have?\"\\n\\n \"Seventeen knots,\" Bobby Lembeck said. \"Good strong wind.\"\\n\\n \"And how long until the wind dies? Sunset?\"\\n\\n \"Probably, yeah. Another three hours.\"\\n\\n I said, \"That\u0027ll be plenty of time.\"\\n\\n I noticed that David Brooks was not saying anything. He just trudged toward the building. Rosie followed close behind him.\\n\\n \"But you never know,\" Davenport said. \"We could all be toast. Any minute now.\" He laughed again, in his irritating way.\\n\\n Ricky said, \"Charley, why don\u0027t you shut the fuck up?\"\\n\\n \"Why don\u0027t you come out and make me, big boy?\" Charley said. \"What\u0027s the matter, your veins clogged with chicken shit?\"\\n\\n I said, \"Let\u0027s stay focused, Charley.\"\\n\\n \"Hey, I\u0027m focused. I\u0027m focused.\"\\n\\n The wind was blowing sand, creating a brownish blur just above the ground. Mae walked beside me. She looked across the desert and said abruptly, \"I want to have a look at the rabbit. You all go ahead if you want.\"\\n\\n She headed off to the right, toward the carcass. I went with her. And the others turned in a group and followed us. It seemed everybody wanted to stay together. The wind was still strong. Charley said, \"Why do you want to see it, Mae?\"\\n\\n \"I want to check something.\" She was pulling on gloves as she walked.\\n\\n The headset crackled. Ricky said, \"Would somebody please tell me what the hell is going on?\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re going to see the rabbit,\" Charley said.\\n\\n \"What for?\"\\n\\n \"Mae wants to see it.\"\\n\\n \"She saw it before. Guys, you\u0027re very exposed out there. I wouldn\u0027t be waltzing around.\"\\n\\n \"Nobody\u0027s waltzing around, Ricky.\"\\n\\n By now I could see the rabbit in the distance, partially obscured by the blowing sand. In a few moments, we were all standing over the carcass. The wind had blown the body over on its side. Mae crouched down, turned it on its back, laid open the carcass.\\n\\n \"Jeez,\" Rosie said.\\n\\n I was startled to see that the exposed flesh was no longer smooth and pink. Instead, it was roughened everywhere, and in a few places looked as if it had been scraped. And it was covered by a milky white coating.\\n\\n \"Looks like it was dipped in acid,\" Charley said.\\n\\n \\n\\n \"Yes, it does,\" Mae said. She sounded grim.\\n\\n I glanced at my watch. All this had occurred in two hours. \"What happened to it?\" Mae had taken out her magnifying glass and was bent close to the animal. She looked here and there, moving the glass quickly. Then she said, \"It\u0027s been partially eaten.\"\\n\\n \"Eaten? By what?\"\\n\\n \"Bacteria.\"\\n\\n \"Wait a minute,\" Charley Davenport said. \"You think this is caused by Theta-d? You think the E. coli is eating it?\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll know soon enough,\" she said. She reached into a pouch, and pulled out several glass tubes containing sterile swabs.\\n\\n \"But it\u0027s only been dead a short time.\"\\n\\n \"Long enough,\" Mae said. \"And high temperatures accelerate growth.\" She daubed the animal with one swab after another, replacing each in a glass tube. \"Then the Theta-d must be multiplying very aggressively.\"\\n\\n \"Bacteria will do that if you give them a good nutrient source. You shift into log phase growth where they\u0027re doubling every two or three minutes. I think that\u0027s what\u0027s happening here.\"\\n\\n I said, \"But if that\u0027s true, it means the swarm-\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know what it means, Jack,\" she said quickly. She looked at me and gave a slight shake of the head. The meaning was clear: not now.\\n\\n But the others weren\u0027t put off. \"Mae, Mae, Mae,\" Charley Davenport said. \"You\u0027re telling us that the swarms killed the rabbit in order to eat it? In order to grow more coli? And make more nanoswarms?\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t say that, Charley.\" Her voice was calm, almost soothing. \"But that\u0027s what you think,\" Charley continued. \"You think the swarms consume mammalian tissue in order to reproduce-\"\\n\\n \"Yes. That\u0027s what I think, Charley.\" Mae put her swabs away carefully, and got to her feet. \"But I\u0027ve taken cultures, now. We\u0027ll run them in Luria and agerose, and we\u0027ll see what we see.\"\\n\\n \"I bet if we come back in another hour, this white stuff will be gone, and we\u0027ll see black forming all over the body. New black nanoparticles. And eventually there\u0027ll be enough for a new swarm.\"\\n\\n She nodded. \"Yes. I think so, too.\"\\n\\n \"And that\u0027s why the wildlife around here has disappeared?\" David Brooks said.\\n\\n \"Yes.\" She brushed a strand of hair back with her hand. \"This has been going on for a while.\" There was a moment of silence. We all stood around the rabbit carcass, our backs to the blowing wind. The carcass was being consumed so quickly, I imagined I could almost see it happening right before my eyes, in real time.\\n\\n \"We better get rid of those fucking swarms,\" Charley said.\\n\\n We all turned, and set off for the shed.\\n\\n Nobody spoke.\\n\\n There was nothing to say.\\n\\n As we walked ahead, some of those small birds that hopped around the desert floor under the cholla cactus suddenly took to the air, chittering and wheeling before us. I said to Mae, \"So there\u0027s no wildlife, but the birds are here?\"\\n\\n \"Seems to be that way.\"\\n\\n The flock wheeled and came back, then settled to the ground a hundred yards away. \"Maybe they\u0027re too small for the swarms to bother with,\" Mae said. \"Not enough flesh on their bodies.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe.\" I was thinking there might be another answer. But to be sure, I would have to check the code.\\n\\n I stepped from the sun into the shade of the corrugated shed, and moved along the line of cars toward the door of the storage unit. The door was plastered with warning symbols-for nuclear radiation, biohazard, microwaves, high explosives, laser radiation. Charley said, \"You can see why we keep this shit outside.\"\\n\\n As I came to the door, Vince said, \"Jack, you have a call. I\u0027ll patch it.\" My cell phone rang. It was probably Julia. I flipped it open. \"Hello?\"\\n\\n \"Dad.\" It was Eric. With that emphatic tone that he got when he was upset.\\n\\n I sighed. \"Yes, Eric.\"\\n\\n \"When are you coming back?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not sure, son.\"\\n\\n \"Will you be here for dinner?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m afraid not. Why? What\u0027s the problem?\"\\n\\n \"She is such an asshole.\"\\n\\n \"Eric, just tell me what the problem-\"\\n\\n \"Aunt Ellen sticks up for her all the time. It\u0027s not fair.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m kind of busy now, Eric, so just tell me-\"\\n\\n \"Why? What are you doing?\"\\n\\n \"Just tell me what\u0027s wrong, son.\"\\n\\n \"Never mind,\" he said, turning sulky, \"if you\u0027re not coming home, it doesn\u0027t matter. Where are you, anyway? Are you in the desert?\"\\n\\n \"Yes. How did you know that?\"\\n\\n \"I talked to Mom. Aunt Ellen made us go to the hospital to see her. It\u0027s not fair. I didn\u0027t want to go. She made me anyway.\"\\n\\n \"Uh-huh. How is Mom?\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027s checking out of the hospital.\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027s finished all her tests?\"\\n\\n \"The doctors wanted her to stay,\" Eric said. \"But she wants to get out. She has a cast on her arm, that\u0027s all. She says everything else is fine. Dad? Why do I always have to do what Aunt Ellen says? It\u0027s not fair.\"\\n\\n \"Let me talk to Ellen.\"\\n\\n \"She isn\u0027t here. She took Nicole to buy a new dress for her play.\"\\n\\n \"Who\u0027s with you at the house?\"\\n\\n \"Maria.\"\\n\\n \"Okay,\" I said. \"Have you done your homework?\"\\n\\n \"Not yet.\"\\n\\n \"Well, get busy, son. I want your homework done before dinner.\" It was amazing how these lines just popped out of a parent\u0027s mouth.\\n\\n By now I had reached the storage room door. I stared at all the warning signs. There were several I didn\u0027t know, like a diamond made up of four different colored squares inside, each with a number. Mae unlocked the door and went in.\\n\\n \"Dad?\" Eric started to cry. \"When are you coming home?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" I said. \"I hope by tomorrow.\"\\n\\n \"Okay. Promise?\"\\n\\n \"I promise.\"\\n\\n I could hear him sniffling, and then through the phone a long snarff sound as he wiped his nose on his shirt. I told him he could call me later if he wanted to. He seemed better, and said okay, and then said good-bye.\\n\\n I hung up, and entered the storage building.\\n\\n The interior was divided into two large storage rooms, with shelves on all four walls, and freestanding shelves in the middle of the rooms. Concrete walls, concrete floor. There was another door in the second room, and a corrugated rollup door for truck deliveries. Hot sunlight came in through wood-frame windows. The air-conditioning rumbled noisily but, as Mae had said, the rooms were still hot. I closed the door behind me, and looked at the seal. It was just ordinary weather stripping. The shed was definitely not airtight. I walked along the shelves, stacked with bins of spare parts for the fabrication machinery, and the labs. The second room had more mundane items: cleaning supplies, toilet paper, bars of soap, boxes of cereal, and a couple of refrigerators filled with food. I turned to Mae. \"Where are the isotopes?\"\\n\\n \"Over here.\" She led me around a set of shelves, to a steel lid set in the concrete floor. The lid was about three feet in diameter. It looked like a buried garbage can, except for the glowing LED and keypad in the center. Mae dropped to one knee, and punched in a code quickly. The lid lifted with a hiss.\\n\\n I saw a ladder that led down into a circular steel chamber. The isotopes were stored in metal containers of different sizes. Apparently Mae could tell which they were just by looking, because she said, \"We have Selenium-172. Shall we use that?\"\\n\\n \"Sure.\"\\n\\n Mae started to climb down into the chamber.\\n\\n \"Will you fucking cut it out?\" In a corner of the room, David Brooks jumped back from Charley Davenport. Charley was holding a big spray bottle of Windex cleaner. He was testing the squeeze trigger mechanism, and in the process spraying streaks of water on David. It didn\u0027t look accidental. \"Give me that damn thing,\" David said, snatching the bottle away. \"I think it might work,\" Charley said blandly. \"But we\u0027d need a remote mechanism.\" From the first room, Rosie said, \"Would this work?\" She held up a shiny cylinder, with wires dangling from it. \"Isn\u0027t this a solenoid relay?\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" David said. \"But I doubt it can exert enough force to squeeze this bottle. Has it got a rating? We need something bigger.\"\\n\\n \"And don\u0027t forget, you also need a remote controller,\" Charley said. \"Unless you want to stand there and spray the fucker yourself.\"\\n\\n Mae came up from below, carrying a heavy metal tube. She walked to the sink, and reached for a bottle of straw-colored liquid. She pulled on heavy rubber-coated gloves, and started to mix the isotope into the liquid. A radiation counter over the sink was chattering. Over the headset, Ricky said, \"Aren\u0027t you guys forgetting something? Even if you have a remote, how are you going to get the cloud to come to it? Because I don\u0027t think the swarm will just come over and stand there while you hose it down.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll find something to attract them,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Like what?\"\\n\\n \"They were attracted to the rabbit.\"\\n\\n \"We don\u0027t have any rabbits.\"\\n\\n Charley said, \"You know, Ricky, you are a very negative person.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m just telling you the facts.\"\\n\\n \"Thank you for sharing,\" Charley said.\\n\\n Like Mae, Charley was seeing it, too: Ricky had dragged his feet every step of the way. It was as if Ricky wanted to keep the swarms alive. Which made no sense at all. But that\u0027s how he was behaving.\\n\\n I would have said something to Charley about Ricky, but over our headsets everybody heard everything. The downside of modern communications: everybody can listen in. \"Hey guys?\" It was Bobby Lembeck. \"How\u0027s it coming?\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re getting there. Why?\"\\n\\n \"The wind\u0027s dropping.\"\\n\\n \"What is it now?\" I said.\\n\\n \"Fifteen knots. Down from eighteen.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s still strong,\" I said. \"We\u0027re okay.\"\\n\\n \"I know. I\u0027m just telling you.\"\\n\\n From the next room, Rosie said, \"What\u0027s thermite?\" In her hand she held a plastic tray filled with thumb-sized metal tubes.\\n\\n \"Careful with that,\" David said. \"It must be left over from construction. I guess they did thermite welding.\"\\n\\n \"But what is it?\"\\n\\n \"Thermite is aluminum and iron oxide,\" David said. \"It burns very hot-three thousand degrees-and so bright you can\u0027t look directly at it. And it\u0027ll melt steel for welding.\"\\n\\n \"How much of that have we got?\" I said to Rosie. \"Because we can use it tonight.\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s four boxes back there.\" She plucked one tube from the box. \"So how do you set \u0027em off?\"\\n\\n \"Be careful, Rosie. That\u0027s a magnesium wrapper. Any decent heat source will ignite it.\"\\n\\n \"Even matches?\"\\n\\n \"If you want to lose your hand. Better use road flares, something with a fuse.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll see,\" she said, and she disappeared around the corner.\\n\\n The radiation counter was still clicking. I turned to the sink. Mae had capped the isotope tube. She was now pouring the straw-colored liquid into a Windex bottle. \"Hey, guys?\" It was Bobby Lembeck again. \"I\u0027m picking up some instability. Wind\u0027s fluctuating at twelve knots.\"\\n\\n \"Okay,\" I said. \"We don\u0027t need to hear every little change, Bobby.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m seeing some instability, is all.\"\\n\\n \"I think we\u0027re okay for the moment, Bobby.\"\\n\\n Mae was going to be another few minutes, in any case. I went over to a computer workstation and turned it on. The screen glowed; there was a menu of options. Aloud, I said, \"Ricky, can I put up the swarm code on this monitor?\"\\n\\n \"The code?\" Ricky said. He sounded alarmed. \"What do you want the code for?\"\\n\\n \"I want to see what you guys have done.\"\\n\\n \"Why?\"\\n\\n \"Ricky, for Christ\u0027s sake, can I see it or not?\"\\n\\n \"Sure, of course you can. All the code revisions are in the directory slash code. It\u0027s passworded.\"\\n\\n I was typing. I found the directory. But I wasn\u0027t being allowed to enter it. \"And the password is?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s l-a-n-g-t-o-n, all lowercase.\"\\n\\n \"Okay.\"\\n\\n I entered the password. I was now in the directory, looking at a list of program modifications, each with file size and date. The document sizes were large, which meant that these were all programs for other aspects of the swarm mechanism. Because the code for the particles themselves would be small-just a few lines, maybe eight, ten kilobytes, no more. \"Ricky.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, Jack.\"\\n\\n \"Where\u0027s the particle code?\"\\n\\n \"Isn\u0027t it there?\"\\n\\n \"God damn it, Ricky. Stop screwing around.\"\\n\\n \"Hey, Jack, I\u0027m not responsible for the archiving-\"\\n\\n \"Ricky, these are workfiles, not archives,\" I said. \"Tell me where.\"\\n\\n A brief pause. \"There should be a subdirectory slash C-D-N. It\u0027s kept there.\"\\n\\n I scrolled down. \"I see it.\"\\n\\n Within this directory, I found a list of files, all very small. The modification dates started about six weeks ago. There was nothing new from the last two weeks. \"Ricky. You haven\u0027t changed the code for two weeks?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, about that.\"\\n\\n I clicked on the most recent document. \"You got high-level summaries?\" When these guys had worked for me, I always insisted that they write natural language summaries of the program structure. It was faster to review than documentation within the code itself. And they often solved logic problems when they had to write it out briefly. \"Should be there,\" Ricky said.\\n\\n On the screen, I saw:\\n\\n /*Initialize*/\\n\\n For j\u003d1 to L x V do\\n\\n Sj \u003d 0 /*set initial demand to 0/\\n\\n End For\\n\\n For i\u003dl to z do\\n\\n For j \u003d 1 to L x V do\\n\\n ij \u003d (state (x,y,z)) /*agent threshold param*/\\n\\n ? ij \u003d (intent (Cj,Hj)) /*agent intention fill*/\\n\\n Response \u003d 0 /* begin agent response*/\\n\\n Zone \u003d z(i) /* intitial zone unlearned by agent*/\\n\\n Sweep \u003d1 /* activate agent travel*/\\n\\n End For\\n\\n End For\\n\\n /*Main*/\\n\\n For kl\u003d1 to RVd do\\n\\n For tm\u003d1 to nv do \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/prey/page-13.html","bookId":1714,"book":{"id":1714,"title":"Prey","description":"Storyline: In the Nevada desert, an experiment has gone horribly wrong.
