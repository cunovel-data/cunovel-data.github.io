Didn\u0027t you know?\"\n \"I was busy,\" I said. \"So he\u0027s back there?\"\n \"Yeah.\"\n \"Is he dead?\"\n \"No, no. He\u0027s alive.\"\n I was still breathing hard, still dizzy. \"What?\"\n \"It\u0027s hard to tell on the video monitor, but it looks like he is alive ...\"\n \"Then why the fuck don\u0027t you guys go get him?\"\n Ricky\u0027s voice was calm. \"We can\u0027t, Jack. We have to take care of Mae.\"\n \"Someone here could go.\"\n \"We don\u0027t have anyone to spare.\"\n \"I can\u0027t go,\" I said. \"I\u0027m in no shape to go.\"\n \"Of course not,\" Ricky said, turning on his soothing voice. The undertaker\u0027s voice. \"All this must be a terrible shock to you, Jack, all you\u0027ve gone through-\"\n \"Just ... tell me ... who\u0027s going to get him, Ricky?\"\n \"To be brutally honest,\" Ricky said, \"I don\u0027t think there\u0027s any point. He had a convulsion. A bad one. I don\u0027t think he has much left.\"\n I said, \"Nobody\u0027s going?\"\n \"I\u0027m afraid there\u0027s no point, Jack.\"\n Inside the airlock, Bobby was helping Mae out and leading her down the corridor. Ricky was standing there. Watching me through the glass.\n \"Your turn, Jack. Come on in.\"\n I didn\u0027t move. I stayed leaning against the wall. I said, \"Somebody has to go get him.\"\n \"Not right now. The wind isn\u0027t stable, Jack. It\u0027ll fall again any minute.\"\n \"But he\u0027s alive.\"\n \"Not for long.\"\n \"Somebody has to go,\" I said.\n \"Jack, you know as well as I do what we\u0027re up against,\" Ricky said. He was doing the voice of reason now, calm and logical. \"We\u0027ve had terrible losses. We can\u0027t risk anybody else. By the time somebody gets to Charley, he\u0027ll be dead. He may be dead already. Come on and get in the airlock.\"\n I was taking stock of my body, feeling my breathing, my chest, my deep fatigue. I couldn\u0027t go back out right now. Not in the condition I was in.\n So I got into the airlock.\n With a roar, the blowers flattened my hair, fluttered my clothes, and cleaned the black particles from my clothes and skin. My vision improved almost immediately. I breathed easier. Now they were blowing upward. I held out my hand and saw it turn from black to pale gray, then to normal flesh color again.\n Now the blowers came from the sides. I took a deep breath. The pinpricks were no longer so painful on my skin. Either I was feeling them less, or they were being blown off my skin. My head cleared a little. I took another breath. I didn\u0027t feel good. But I felt better. The glass doors opened. Ricky held out his arms. \"Jack. Thank God you\u0027re safe.\"\n I didn\u0027t answer him. I just turned around, and went back the way I had come.\n \"Jack ...\"\n The glass doors whished shut, and locked with a thunk. \"I\u0027m not leaving him out there,\" I said.\n \"What\u0027re you going to do? You can\u0027t carry him, he\u0027s too big. What\u0027re you going to do?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know. But I\u0027m not leaving him behind, Ricky.\"\n And I went back outside.\n Of course I was doing exactly what Ricky wanted-exactly what he expected me to do-but I didn\u0027t realize it at the time. And even if somebody had told me, I wouldn\u0027t have credited Ricky with that degree of psychological sophistication. Ricky was pretty obvious in the way he managed people. But this time, he got me.\n DAY 6\n 4:22 P.M.\n The wind was blowing briskly. There was no sign of the swarms, and I crossed to the shed without incident. I didn\u0027t have a headset so I was spared Ricky\u0027s commentary. The back passenger door of the Toyota was open. I found Charley lying on his back, motionless. It took me a moment to see he was still breathing, although shallowly. With an effort, I managed to pull him into a sitting position. He stared at me with dull eyes. His lips were blue and his skin was chalky gray. A tear ran down his cheek. His mouth moved. \"Don\u0027t try to talk,\" I said. \"Save your energy.\" Grunting, I pulled him over to the edge of the seat, by the door, and swung his legs around so he was facing out. Charley was a big guy, six feet tall and at least twenty pounds heavier than I was. I knew I couldn\u0027t carry him back. But behind the backseat of the Toyota I saw the fat tires of a dirt bike. That might work. \"Charley, can you hear me?\"\n An almost imperceptible nod.\n \"Can you stand up?\"\n Nothing. No reaction. He wasn\u0027t looking at me; he was staring into space.\n \"Charley,\" I said, \"do you think you can stand?\"\n He nodded again, then straightened his body so he slid off the seat, and landed on the ground. He stood shakily for a moment, his legs trembling, and then he collapsed against me, clutching me to hold himself up. I sagged under his weight.\n \"Okay, Charley ...\" I eased him back to the car, and sat him down on the running board. \"Just stay there, okay?\"\n I let go of him, and he remained sitting. He still stared into space, unfocused.\n \"I\u0027ll be right back.\"\n I went around to the back of the Land Cruiser, and popped the trunk. There was a dirt bike, all right-the cleanest dirt bike I had ever seen. It was encased in a heavy Mylar bag. And it had been wiped down after it was used. That would be David\u0027s way, I thought. He was always so clean, so organized.\n I pulled the bike out of the car and set it on the ground. There was no key in the ignition. I went to the front of the Toyota, and opened the passenger door. The front seats were spotless and carefully ordered. David had one of those suction cup notepads on the dashboard, a cradle for his cell phone, and a telephone headset mounted on a little hook. I opened his glove box and saw that the interior was neatly arranged, too. Registration papers in an envelope, beneath a small plastic tray divided into compartments containing lip balm, Kleenex, Band-Aids. No keys. Then I noticed that between the seats there was a storage box for the CD player, and beneath it was a locked tray. It had the same kind of lock as the ignition. It probably opened with the ignition key.\n I banged the tray with the heel of my hand, and heard something metallic rattle inside. It might have been a small key. Like a dirt bike key. Anyway, something metal. Where were David\u0027s keys? I wondered if Vince had taken David\u0027s keys away on arrival, as he had taken mine. If so, then the keys were in the lab. That wouldn\u0027t do me any good. I looked toward the lab building, wondering if I should go back to get them. That was when I noticed that the wind was blowing less strongly. There was still a layer of sand blowing along the ground, but it was less vigorous.\n Great, I thought. That\u0027s all I need now.\n Feeling new urgency, I decided to give up on the dirt bike and its missing key. Perhaps there was something in the storage shed that I could use to move Charley back to the lab. I didn\u0027t remember anything, but I went into the shed to check, anyway. I entered cautiously, hearing a banging sound. It turned out to be the far door, banging open and shut in the wind. Rosie\u0027s body lay just inside the door, alternately light and dark as the door banged. She had the same milky coating on her skin that the rabbit had had. But I didn\u0027t go over to look closely. I hastily searched the shelves, opened the utility closet, looked behind stacked boxes. I found a furniture dolly made of wooden slats with small rollers. But it would be useless in sand. I went back outside under the corrugated shed, and hurried to the Toyota. There was nothing to do but try to carry Charley across to the lab building. I might be able to manage it if he could support part of his own weight. Maybe by now he was feeling better, I thought. Maybe he was stronger.\n But one look at his face told me he wasn\u0027t. If anything, he appeared weaker.\n \"Shit, Charley, what am I going to do with you?\"\n He didn\u0027t answer.\n \"I can\u0027t carry you. And David didn\u0027t leave any keys in his car, so we\u0027re out of luck-\" I stopped.\n What if David were locked out of his car? He was an engineer, he thought of contingencies like that. Even if it was unlikely to happen, David would never be caught unprepared. He\u0027d never be flagging down cars asking if they had a wire hanger he could borrow. No, no. David would have hidden a key. Probably in one of those magnetic key boxes. I started to lie down on my back to look underneath the car when it occurred to me that David would never get his clothes dirty just to retrieve a key. He\u0027d hide it cleverly, but within easy reach. With that in mind, I ran my fingers along the inside of the front bumpers. Nothing. I went to the back bumper, did the same. Nothing. I felt under the running boards on both sides of the car. Nothing. No magnetic box, no key. I couldn\u0027t believe it, so I got down and looked under the car, to see if there was a brace or a strut I had somehow missed with my fingers. No, there wasn\u0027t. I felt no key.\n I shook my head, puzzled. The hiding place needed to be steel for the magnetic box. And it needed to be protected from the elements. That was why almost everybody hid their keys inside the car bumpers.\n David hadn\u0027t done that.\n Where else could you hide a key?\n I walked around the car again, looking at the smooth lines of the metal. I ran my fingers around the front grill opening, and under the back license plate indentation. No key.\n I started to sweat. It wasn\u0027t only the tension: by now I could definitely feel the drop in the wind. I went back to Charley, who was still sitting on the sideboard.\n \"How you doing, Charley?\"\n He didn\u0027t answer, just gave a little shrug. I took his headset off, and put it on. I heard static, and voices talking softly. It sounded like Ricky and Bobby, and it sounded like an argument. I pulled the mouthpiece near my lips and said, \"Guys? Speak to me.\"\n A pause. Bobby, surprised: \"Jack?\"\n \"That\u0027s right ...\"\n \"Jack, you can\u0027t stay there. The wind\u0027s been falling steadily for the last few minutes. It\u0027s only ten knots now.\"\n \"Okay ...\"\n \"Jack, you\u0027ve got to come back in.\"\n \"I can\u0027t just yet.\"\n \"Below seven knots, the swarms can move.\"\n \"Okay ...\"\n Ricky: \"What do you mean, okay? Jesus, Jack, are you coming in or not?\"\n \"I can\u0027t carry Charley.\"\n \"You knew that when you went out.\"\n \"Uh-huh.\"\n \"Jack. What the hell are you doing?\"\n I heard the whirr of the video monitor in the corner of the shed. I looked over the roof of the car and saw the lens rotate as they zoomed in on me. The Toyota was such a big car, it almost blocked my view of the camera. And the ski rack on top made it even higher. I vaguely wondered why David had a ski rack, because he didn\u0027t ski; he always hated cold. The rack must have come with the car as standard equipment and-\n I swore. It was so obvious.\n There was only one place I hadn\u0027t checked. I jumped up on the running board and looked at the roof of the car. I ran my fingers over the ski rack, and along the parallel tracks bolted to the roof. My fingers touched black tape against the black rack. I pulled the tape away, and saw a silver key.\n \"Jack? Nine knots.\"\n \"Okay.\"\n I dropped back down to the ground, and climbed in the driver\u0027s seat. I put the key in the lock box and twisted it. The box opened. Inside I found a small yellow key. \"Jack? What\u0027re you doing?\"\n I hurried around to the back of the car. I fitted the yellow key in the ignition. I straddled the bike and started it up. The motor rumbled loudly under the corrugated shed.\n \"Jack?\"\n I walked the bike around the side of the car to where Charley was sitting. That was going to be the tricky part. The bike didn\u0027t have a kickstand; I moved as close to Charley as I could and then tried to support him enough that he could climb onto the backseat while I still sat on the bike and kept it upright. Fortunately, he seemed to understand what I was doing; I got him in place and told him to hold on to me.\n Bobby Lembeck: \"Jack? They\u0027re here.\"\n \"Where?\"\n \"South side. Coming toward you.\"\n \"Okay.\"\n I gunned the motor, and pulled the passenger door shut. And I stayed exactly where I was.\n \"Jack?\"\n Ricky: \"What\u0027s the matter with him? He knows what the danger is.\"\n Bobby: \"I know.\"\n \"He\u0027s just sitting there.\"\n Charley had his hands around my waist. His head was on my shoulder. I could hear his raspy breathing. I said, \"Hold tight, Charley.\" He nodded.\n Ricky: \"Jack? What\u0027re you doing?\"\n Then at my ear, in a voice just above a whisper, Charley said, \"Fucking idiot.\"\n \"Yes.\" I nodded. I waited. I could see the swarms now, coming around the building. This time there were nine swarms, and they headed straight for me in a V formation. Their own flocking behavior.\n Nine swarms, I thought. Soon there would be thirty swarms, and then two hundred ...\n Bobby: \"Jack, do you see them?\"\n \"I see them.\" Of course I saw them.\n And of course they were different from before. They were denser now, the columns thicker and more substantial. Those swarms didn\u0027t weigh three pounds anymore. I sensed they were closer to ten or twenty pounds. Maybe even more than that. Maybe thirty pounds. They would have real weight now, and real substance.\n I waited. I stayed where I was. Some detached part of my brain was wondering what the formation would do when it reached me. Would they circle me? Would some of the swarms hang back and wait? What did they make of the noisy bike?\n Nothing-they came right for me, flattening the V into a line, then into a kind of inverted V. I could hear the deep vibrating hum. With so many swarms it was much louder. The swirling columns were twenty yards away from me, then ten. Were they able to move faster now, or was it my imagination? I waited until they were almost upon me before I twisted the throttle and raced forward. I passed straight through the lead swarm, into the blackness and out again, and then I was gunning for the power station door, bouncing over the desert, not daring to look back over my shoulder. It was a wild ride, and it only lasted a few seconds. As we reached the power station, I dropped the bike, put my shoulder under Charley\u0027s arm, and staggered the final step or two to the door.\n The swarms were still fifty yards away from the door when I managed to turn the knob, pull, get one foot in the crack, and kick the door open the rest of the way. When I did that I lost my balance, and Charley and I more or less fell through the door onto the concrete. The door came swinging shut, and whanged into our legs, which hung outside. I felt a sharp pain in my ankles-but worse, the door was still open, kept ajar by our legs. Through the opening I could see the swarms approaching.\n I scrambled to my feet and dragged Charley\u0027s inert body into the room. The door shut, but I knew it was a fire door, and it wasn\u0027t airtight. Nanoparticles could come right in. I had to get both of us into the airlock. We wouldn\u0027t be safe until the first set of glass doors had hissed shut. Grunting and sweating, I hauled Charley into the airlock. I got him into a sitting position, propped up against the side blowers. That cleared his feet of the glass doors. And because only one person could be in the airlock at a time, I stepped back outside. And I waited for the doors to close.\n But they didn\u0027t close.\n I looked on the side wall for some sort of button, but I didn\u0027t see anything. The lights were on inside the airlock, so it was getting power. But the doors didn\u0027t close. And I knew the swarms were fast approaching.\n Bobby Lembeck and Mae came running into the far room. I saw them through the second set of glass doors. They were waving their arms, making big gestures, apparently indicating for me to come back into the airlock. But that didn\u0027t make sense. Into my headset, I said, \"I thought you had to go one at a time.\"\n They didn\u0027t have headsets, and couldn\u0027t hear me. They were waving frantically, come in, come in.\n I held up two fingers questioningly.\n They shook their heads. They seemed to be indicating I was missing the point. At my feet, I saw the nanoparticles begin to come into the room like black steam. They were coming through the edges of the fire door. I had only five or ten seconds now. I stepped back in the airlock. Bobby and Mae were nodding, approving. But the doors did not close. Now they were making other gestures, lifting.\n \"You want me to lift Charley?\"\n They did. I shook my head. Charley was slumped there in a sitting position, a dead weight on the ground. I looked back at the anteroom, and saw it was filling with black particles, starting to form a grayish mist in the air. The grayish mist was coming into the airlock as well. I felt the first tiny pinpricks on my skin.\n I looked at Bobby and Mae, on the other side of the glass. They could see what was happening; they knew only seconds remained. They were again making gestures: lift Charley up. I bent over him, got my hands under his armpits. I tried to haul him to his feet, but he didn\u0027t budge.\n \"Charley, for God\u0027s sake, help.\" Groaning, I tried again. Charley kicked his legs and pushed with his arms and I got him a couple of feet off the ground. Then he slid back down. \"Charley, come on, once more ...\" I pulled up as hard as I could, and this time he helped a lot and we got his legs back under him and with a final heave, got him standing. I kept my hands under his armpits; we were in a kind of crazy lovers\u0027 clench. Charley was wheezing. I looked back to the glass doors.\n The doors didn\u0027t close.\n The air was getting blacker all the time. I looked to Mae and Bobby, and they were frantic, holding up two fingers, shaking them at me. I didn\u0027t get it. \"Yes, there\u0027s two of us ...\" What was wrong with the damned doors? Finally Mae bent over, and very deliberately pointed with one finger of each hand to her two shoes. I saw her mouth, \"Two shoes.\" And point to Charley. \"Yeah, so, we have two shoes. He\u0027s standing on two shoes.\"\n Mae shook her head.\n She held up four fingers.\n \"Four shoes?\"\n The pinpricks were irritating, making it difficult to think. I felt the old confusion begin to seep over me. My brain felt sluggish. What did she mean, four shoes? It was beginning to get dark in the airlock. It was becoming harder to see Mae and Bobby. They were pantomiming something else, but I didn\u0027t get it. They began to feel distant to me, distant and trivial. I was without energy, and without care. Two shoes, four shoes.\n And then I got it. I turned my back to Charley, leaned against him, and said, \"Put your hands around my neck.\" He did, and I grabbed his legs and lifted his feet off the floor. Instantly, the door hissed shut.\n That was it, I thought.\n The blowers began to blast down on us. The air rapidly cleared. I strained to hold Charley up and I managed until I saw the second set of doors unlock and slide open. Mae and Bobby hurried into the airlock.\n And I just fell down. Charley landed on top of me. I think it was Bobby who dragged him off me. I\u0027m not sure. From that point on, I don\u0027t remember much at all.\n NEST\n DAY 6\n 6:18 P.M.\n I woke up in my bed in the residential module. The air handlers were roaring so loudly the room sounded like an airport. Bleary-eyed, I staggered over to the door. The door was locked. I pounded on it for a while but nobody answered, even when I yelled. I went to the little workstation on the desk and clicked it on. A menu came up and I searched for some kind of intercom. I didn\u0027t see anything like that, although I poked around the interface for a while. I must have set something off, because a window opened and Ricky appeared, smiling at me. He said, \"So, you\u0027re awake. How do you feel?\"\n \"Unlock the goddamn door.\"\n \"Is your door locked?\"\n \"Unlock it, damn it.\"\n \"It was only for your own protection.\"\n \"Ricky,\" I said, \"open the damn door.\"\n \"I already did. It\u0027s open, Jack.\"\n I walked to the door. He was right, it opened immediately. I looked at the latch. There was an extra bolt, some kind of remote locking mechanism. I\u0027d have to remember to tape over that. On the monitor, Ricky said, \"You might want to take a shower.\"\n \"Yeah, I would. Why is the air so loud?\"\n \"We turned on full venting in your room,\" Ricky said. \"In case there were any extra particles.\"\n I rummaged in my bag for clothes. \"Where\u0027s the shower?\"\n \"Do you want some help?\"\n \"No, I do not want some help. Just tell me where the goddamn shower is.\"\n \"You sound angry.\"\n \"Fuck you, Ricky.\"\n The shower helped. I stood under it for about twenty minutes, letting the steaming hot water run over my aching body. I seemed to have a lot of bruises-on my chest, my thigh-but I couldn\u0027t remember how I had gotten them.\n When I came out, I found Ricky there, sitting on a bench. \"Jack, I\u0027m very concerned.\"\n \"How\u0027s Charley?\"\n \"He seems to be okay. He\u0027s sleeping.\"\n \"Did you lock his room, too?\"\n \"Jack. I know you\u0027ve been through an ordeal, and I want you to know we\u0027re all very grateful for what you\u0027ve done-I mean, the company is grateful, and-\"\n \"Fuck the company.\"\n \"Jack, I understand how you might be angry.\"\n \"Cut the crap, Ricky. I got no goddamn help at all. Not from you, and not from anybody else in this place.\"\n \"I\u0027m sure it must feel that way ...\"\n \"It is that way, Ricky. No help is no help.\"\n \"Jack, Jack. Please. I\u0027m trying to tell you that I\u0027m sorry for everything that happened. I feel terrible about it. I really do. If there were any way to go back and change it, believe me, I would.\"\n I looked at him. \"I don\u0027t believe you, Ricky.\"\n He gave a winning little smile. \"I hope in time that will change.\"\n \"It won\u0027t.\"\n \"You know that I always valued our friendship, Jack. It was always the most important thing to me.\"\n I just stared at him. Ricky wasn\u0027t listening at all. He just had that silly smile-and-everything-will-be-fine look on his face. I thought, Is he on drugs? He was certainly acting bizarrely.\n \"Well, anyway.\" He took a breath, changed the subject. \"Julia\u0027s coming out, that\u0027s good news. She should be here sometime this evening.\"\n \"Uh-huh. Why is she coming out?\"\n \"Well, I\u0027m sure because she\u0027s worried about these runaway swarms.\"\n \"How worried is she?\" I said. \"Because these swarms could have been killed off weeks ago, when the evolutionary patterns first appeared. But that didn\u0027t happen.\"\n \"Yes. Well. The thing is, back then nobody really understood-\"\n \"I think they did.\"\n \"Well, no.\" He managed to appear unjustly accused, and slightly offended. But I was getting tired of his game.\n \"Ricky,\" I said, \"I came out here on the helicopter with a bunch of PR guys. Who notified them there\u0027s a PR problem here?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know about any PR guys.\"\n \"They\u0027d been told not to get out of the helicopter. That it was dangerous here.\"\n He shook his head. \"I have no idea ... I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about.\"\n I threw up my hands, and walked out of the bathroom.\n \"I don\u0027t!\" Ricky called after me, protesting. \"I swear, I don\u0027t know a thing about it!\" Half an hour later, as a kind of peace offering, Ricky brought me the missing code I had been asking for. It was brief, just a sheet of paper.\n \"Sorry about that,\" he said. \"Took me a while to find it. Rosie took a whole subdirectory offline a few days ago to work on one section. I guess she forgot to put it back. That\u0027s why it wasn\u0027t in the main directory.\"\n \"Uh-huh.\" I scanned the sheet. \"What was she working on?\"\n Ricky shrugged. \"Beats me.
