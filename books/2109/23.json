{"id":91674,"no":23,"title":"Page 23","content":"\"Forget %ndree,\" Jarlaxle replied. \"Their affairs are not so important to us now.\"\n Dinin dropped his sharp chin into a slender palm, propped on the table. Not important! he thought. He wanted to spring up and throttle the cryptic leader. He had spent a whole year ...\n Dinin let his thoughts of Vandree trail away. He looked hard at Jarlaxle\u0027s always calm face, searching for dues, then he understood.\n \"My sister\" he said, and Jarlaxle was nodding before the word had left Dinin\u0027s mouth. \"What has she done?\"\n Jarlaxle straightened, looked to the side of the small room, and gave a sharp whistle. On cue, a slab of stone shifted, revealing an alcove, and Vierna Do\u0027Urden, Dinin\u0027s lone surviving sibling, swept into the room. She seemed more splendid and beautiful than Dinin remembered her since the downfall of their house.\n Dinin\u0027s eyes widened as he realized the truth of Vierna\u0027s dressings; Vierna wore her robes! The robes of a high priestess of Lloth, the robes emblazoned with the arachnid and weapon design of House Do\u0027Urden! Dinin did not know that Vierna had kept them, had not seen them in more than a decade.\n \"You risk . ..\" he started to warn, but Vierna\u0027s frenzied expression, her red eyes blazing like twin fires behind the shadows of her high ebony cheekbones, stopped him before he could utter the words.\n \"I have found again the favor of Lloth,\" Vierna announced.\n Dinin looked to Jarlaxle, who only shrugged and quietly shifted his eye-patch to his left eye instead.\n \"The Spider Queen had shown me the way,\" Vierna went on, her normally melodic voice cracking with undeniable excitement.\n Dinin thought the female on the verge of insanity. Vierna had always been so calm and tolerant, even after House Do\u0027Urden\u0027s sudden demise. Over the last few years, though, her actions had become increasingly erratic, and she had spent many hours alone, in desperate prayer to their unmerciful deity.\n \"Are you to tell us this way that Lloth has shown to you?\" Jarlaxle, appearing not at all impressed, asked after many moments of silence.\n \"Drizzt.\" Vierna spat the word, the name of their sacrilegious brother, with a burst of venom through her delicate tips.\n Dinin wisely shifted his hand from his chin to cover his mouth, to bite back his retort. Vierna, for all her apparent foolhardiness, was, after all, a high priestess, and not one to anger.\n \"Drizzt?\" Jarlaxle calmly asked her. \"Your brother?\"\n \"No brother of mine!\" Vierna cried out, rushing to the desk as though she meant to strike Jarlaxle down. Dinin didn\u0027t miss the mercenary leader\u0027s subtle movement, a shift that put his dagger-launching arm in a ready position.\n \"Traitor to House Do\u0027Urden!\" Vierna fumed. \"Traitor to all the drow!\" Her scowl became a smile suddenly, evil and conniving. \"With Drizzt\u0027s sacrifice, I will again find Uoth\u0027s favor, will again . . .\" Vierna broke off abruptly, obviously desiring to keep the rest of her plans private.\n \"You sound like Matron Malice,\" Dinin dared to say. \"She, too, began a hunt for our broth - for the traitor.\"\n \"You remember Matron Malice?\" Jarlaxle teased, using the implications of the name as a sedative on overexcited Vierna. Malice, Vierna\u0027s mother and Matron of House Do\u0027Urden, had ultimately been undone by her failure to recapture and kill the traitorous Drizzt.\n Vierna did calm down, then she began a fit of mocking laughter that went on for many minutes.\n \"You see why I summoned you?\" Jarlaxle remarked to Dinin, taking no heed of the priestess.\n \"You wish me to kill her before she can become a problem?\" Dinin replied equally casually.\n Vierna\u0027s laughter halted; her wild-eyed gaze fell over her impertinent brother. \"WishyaV1 she cried, and a wave of magical energy hurled Dinin from his seat, sent him crashing into the stone wall.\n \"Kneel!\" Vierna commanded, and Dinin, when he regained his composure, fell to his knees, all the while looking at Jarlaxle.\n The mercenary, too, could not hide his surprise. This last command was a simple spell, certainly not one that should have worked so easily on a seasoned fighter of Dinin\u0027s stature.\n \"I am in Lloth\u0027s favor,\" Vierna, standing tall and straight, explained to both of them. \"If you oppose me, then you are not, and with the power of Lloth\u0027s blessings for my spells and curses against you, you will find no defense.\"\n \"The last we heard of Drizzt placed him on the surface,\" Jarlaxle said to Vierna, to deflect her rising anger. \"By all reports, he remains there still.\"\n Vierna nodded, grinning weirdly all the while, her pearly white teeth contrasting dramatically with her shining ebony skin. \"He does,\" she agreed, \"but Lloth has shown me the way to him, the way to glory.\"\n Again, Jarlaxle and Dinin exchanged confused glances. By all their estimates, Vierna\u0027s claims - and Vierna herself - sounded insane.\n But Dinin, against his will and against all measures of sanity, was still kneeling.\n The Inspiring Fear\n I early three decades have passed since Heft my {homeland, a small measure oftimebythereck-\\oning of a drow elf, but a period that seems a lifetime to me. All that I desired, or believed \\thatldesired, when I walked out of Menzober-ranzan\u0027s dark cavern, was a true home, a place of friendship and peace where I might hang my scimitars above the mantle of a warm hearth and share stones with trusted companions.\n I have found all that now, beside Bruenor in the hallowed halls of his youth. Wfe prosper. Wfe have peace. I wear my weapons only on my five-day journeys between MithrS Hall and SUverymoon. W\u0026s / wrong?\n I do not doubt, nor do I ever lament, my decision toleave the vile world of Menzoberranzan, but I am beginning to believe now, in the (endless) quiet and peace, that my desires at that critical time were founded in the inevitable longing of inexperience. I had never known that calm exis-\n I cannot deny that my life is better, a thousand times better, than anything I ever knew in the Underdark. And yet, / cannot remember the last time I felt the anxiety, the inspir-ingfear, of impending battle, the tingling that can come only when an enemy is near or a challenge must be met.\n Oh, I do remember the specific instance - just a year ago, when Wulfgar, Guenhwyvar, and I worked the lower tunnels in the cleansing of MithrS Hall - but that feeling, that tingle of fear, has long faded from memory.\n Are we then creatures of action? Do we say that we desire those accepted cliches of comfort when, in fact, it is the challenge and the adventure, that truly gives us life?\n I must admit, to myself at least, that I do not know.\n There is one point that I cannot dispute, though, one truth that will inevitably help me resolve these questions and which places me in a fortunate position. For now, beside Bruenor and his kin, beside Wulfgar and Catti-brie and Guenhwyvar, dear Guenhwyvar, my destiny is my own to choose.\n I am safer now than ever before in my sixty years of Me. The prospects have never looked better for the future, for continued peace and continued security. And yet, I feel mortal. For the first time, / look to what has passed rather than to what is still to come. There is no other way to explain it. I feel that lam dying, that those stories I so desired to share with friends will soon grow stale, with nothing to replace them.\n But, I remind myself again, the choice is mine to make.\n Jrizzt Do\u0027Urden walked slowly along a trail in the jutting southernmost spur of the Spine of the Wttld Mountains, the sky brightening around him. Far away to the south, across the I plain to the Evermoors, he noticed the glow of the last lights of some distant city, Nesme probably, going down, replaced by the growing dawn. When Drizzt turned another bend in the mountain trail, he saw the small town of Settlestone, far below. The barbarians, Wulfgar\u0027s kin from faraway Icewind Dale, were just beginning their morning routines, trying to put the ruins back in order.\n Drizzt watched the figures, tiny from this distance, bustle about, and he remembered a time not so long ago when Wulfgar and his proud people roamed the frozen tundra of a land far to the north and west, on the other side of the great mountain range, a thousand miles away.\n Spring, the trading season, was fast approaching, and the hardy men and women of Settlestone, working as dealers for the dwarves of Mithril Hall, would soon know more\n wealth and comfort than they ever would have believed possible in their previous day-by-day existence. They had come to Wulfgar\u0027s call, fought valiantly beside the dwarves in the ancient halls, and would soon reap the rewards of their labor, leaving behind their desperate nomadic ways as they had left behind the endless, merciless wind of Icewind Dale.\n \"How far we have all come,\" Drizzt remarked to the chill emptiness of the morning air, and he chuckled at the double-meaning of his words, considering that he had just returned from Silverymoon, a magnificent city far to the east, a place where the beleaguered drow ranger never before dared to believe that he would find acceptance. Indeed, when he had accompanied Bruenor and the others in their search for Mithril Hall, barely two years before, Drizzt had been turned away from Silvery moon\u0027s decorated gates.\n \"Ye\u0027ve done a hundred miles in a week alone,\" came an unexpected answer.\n Drizzt instinctively dropped his slender black hands to the hilts of his scimitars, but his mind caught up to his reflexes and he relaxed immediately, recognizing the melodic voice with more than a little of a dwarvish accent. A moment later, Catti-brie, the adopted human daughter of Bruenor Battlehammer came skipping around a rocky outcropping, her thick auburn mane dancing in the mountain wind and her deep blue eyes glittering like wet jewels in the fresh morning light.\n Drizzt could not hide his smile at the joyous spring in the young girl\u0027s steps, a vitality that the often vicious battles she had faced over the last few years could not diminish. Nor could Drizzt deny the wave of warmth that rushed over him whenever he saw Catti-brie, the young woman who knew him better than any. Catti-brie had understood Drizzt and accepted him for his heart, and not the color of his skin, since their first meeting in a rocky, wind-swept vale more than a decade before, when she was but half her present age.\n The dark elf waited a moment longer, expecting to see Wulfgar, soon to be Catti-brie\u0027s husband, follow her around the bluff.\n \"You have come out a fair distance without an escort,\" Drizzt remarked when the barbarian did not appear.\n Catti-brie crossed her arms over her chest and leaned on one foot, tapping impatiently with the other. \"And ye\u0027re beginning to sound more like me father than me friend,\" she replied. \"I see no escort walking the trails beside Drizzt Do\u0027Urden.\"\n \"Wsll spoken,\" the drow ranger admitted, his tone respectful and not the least bit sarcastic. The young woman\u0027s scolding had pointedly reminded Drizzt that Catti-brie could take care of herself. She carried with her a short sword of dwarven make and wore fine armor under her furred cloak, as fine as the suit of chain mail that Bruenor had given to Drizzt! Taulmaril the Heartseeker, the magical bow of Anariel, rested easily over Catti-brie\u0027s shoulder. Drizzt had never seen a mightier weapon. And, even beyond the powerful tools she carried, Catti-brie had been raised among the sturdy dwarves, by Bruenor himself, as tough as the mountain stone.\n \"Is it often that ye watch the rising sun?\" Catti-brie asked, noticing Drizzt\u0027s east-facing stance.\n Drizzt found a flat rock to sit upon and bade Catti-brie to join him. \"I have watched the dawn since my first days on the surface,\" he explained, throwing his thick forest-green cloak back over his shoulders. \"Though back then, it surely stung my eyes, a reminder of where I came from, I suppose. Now, though, to my relief, I find that I can tolerate the brightness.\"\n \"And well that is,\" Catti-brie replied. She locked the drow\u0027s marvelous eyes with her intense gaze, forced him to look at her, at the same innocent smile he had seen those many years before on a windswept slope in Icewind Dale.\n The smile of his first female friend.\n \"Be sure that ye belong under the sunlight, Drizzt Do\u0027Urden\" Catti-brie continued, \"as much as any person of any race, by me own measure.\"\n Drizzt looked back to the dawn and did not answef. Catti-brie went silent, too, and they sat together for a long while, watching the awakening world.\n \"I came out to see ye,\" Catti-brie said suddenly. Drizzt regarded her curiously, not understanding.\n \"Now, I mean,\" the young woman explained. \"Ws\u0027d word that ye\u0027d returned to Settlestone, and that ye\u0027d be coming back to Mithril Hall in a few days. I\u0027ve been out here every day since.\"\n Drizzt\u0027s expression did not change. \"You wish to talk with me privately?\" he asked, to prompt a reply.\n Catti-brie\u0027s deliberate nod as she turned back to the eastern horizon revealed to Drizzt that something was wrong.\n \"I\u0027ll not forgive ye if ye miss the wedding,\" Catti-brie said softly. She bit down on her bottom lip as she finished, Drizzt noted, and sniffled (though she tried hard to make it seem like the beginnings of a cold).\n Drizzt draped an arm across the beautiful woman\u0027s strong shoulders. \"Can you believe for an instant, even if all the trolls of the Evermoors stood between me and the ceremony hall, that I would not attend?\"\n Catti-brie turned to him - fell into his gaze - and smiled widely, knowing the answer. She threw her arms around Drizzt for a tight hug, then leaped to her feet, pulling him up beside her.\n Drizzt tried to equal her relief, or at least to make her believe that he had. Catti-brie had known all along that he would not miss her wedding to Wulfgar, two of his dearest friends. Why, then, the tears, the sniffle that was not from any budding cold? the perceptive ranger wondered. Why had Catti-brie felt the need to come out and find him only a few hours from the entrance to Mithril Hall?\n He didn\u0027t ask her about it, but it bothered him more than a little. Anytime moisture gathered in Catti-brie\u0027s deep blue eyes, it bothered Drizzt Do\u0027Urden more than a little.\n Jariaxle\u0027s black boots clacked loudly on the stone as he made his solitary way along a winding tunnel outside of Menzoberranzan. Most drow out alone from the great city, in the wilds of the Underdark, would have taken great care, but the mercenary knew what to expect in the tunnels, knew every creature in this particular section.\n Information was Jariaxle\u0027s forte. The scouting network of BreganD\u0027aerthe, the band Jarlaxle had founded and taken to greatness, was more intricate than that of any drow house. Jarlaxle knew everything that happened, or would soon happen, in and around the city, and, armed with that information, he had survived for centuries as a houseless rogue. So long had Jarlaxle been a part of Menzoberranzan\u0027s intrigue that none in the city, with the possible exception of First Matron Mother Baenre, even knew the sly mercenary\u0027s origins.\n He was wearing his shimmering cape now, its magical colors cascading up and down his graceful form, and his wide-brimmed hat, hugely plumed with the feathers of a diatryma, a great flightless Underdark bird, adorned his clean-shaven head. A slender sword dancing beside one hip and a long dirk on the other, were his only visible weapons, but those who knew the sly mercenary realized that he possessed many more than that, concealed on his person, but easily retrieved if the need arose.\n Pulled by curiosity, Jarlaxle picked up his pace. As soon as he realized the length of his strides, he forced himself to slow down, reminding himself that he wanted to be fashionably late for this unorthodox meeting that crazy Vierna had arranged.\n Crazy Vierna.\n Jarlaxle considered the thought for a long while, even stopped his walk and leaned against the tunnel wall to recount the high priestess\u0027s many claims over the last few weeks. What had seemed initially to be a desperate, fleeting hope of a broken noble, with no chance at all of success, was fast becoming a solid plan. Jarlaxle had gone along with Vierna more out of amusement and curiosity than any real beliefs that they would kill, or even locate, the long-gone Drizzt.\n But something apparently was guiding Vierna - Jarlaxle had to believe it was Lloth, or one of the Spider Queen\u0027s powerful minions. Vierna\u0027s clerical powers had returned in fall, it seemed, and she had delivered much valuable information, and even a perfect spy, to their cause. They were fairly sure now where Drizzt Do\u0027Urden was, and Jarlaxle was beginning to believe that killing the traitorous drow would not be such a difficult thing.\n The mercenary\u0027s boots heralded his approach as he clicked around a final bend in the tunnel, coming into a wide, low-roofed chamber. Vierna was there, with Dinin, and it struck Jarlaxle as curious (another note made in the calculating mercenary\u0027s mind) that Vierna seemed more comfortable out here in the wilds than did her brother. Dinin had spent many years in these tunnels, leading patrol groups, but Vierna, as a sheltered noble priestess, had rarefy been out of the city.\n If she truly believed that she walked with Lloth\u0027s blessings, however, then the priestess would have nothing to fear.\n \"You have delivered our gift to the human?\" Vierna asked immediately, urgently. Everything in Vierna\u0027s fife, it seemed to Jarlaxle, had become urgent.\n The sudden question, not prefaced by any greeting or even a remark that he was late, caught the mercenary off guard for a moment, and he looked to Dinin, who responded with only a helpless shrug. While hungry fires burned in Vierna\u0027s eyes, defeated resignation lay in Dinin\u0027s.\n \"The human has the earring,\" Jarlaxle replied.\n Vierna held out a flat, disc-shaped object, covered in designs to match the precious earring. \"It is cool,\" she explained as she rubbed her hand across the disc\u0027s metallic surface, \"thus our spy has already moved far from Menzoberranzan.\"\n \"Far away with a valuable gift,\" Jarlaxle remarked, traces of sarcasm edging his voice.\n \"It was necessary, and will further our cause,\" Vierna snapped at him.\n \"If the human proves to be as valuable an informant as you believe,\" the calm Jarlaxle added evenly.\n \"Do you doubt him?\" Vierna\u0027s words echoed through the tunnels, causing Dinin further distress and sounding dearly as a threat to the mercenary.\n \"It was Lloth who guided me to him,\" Vierna continued with an open sneer, \"Lloth who showed me the way to regain my family\u0027s honor. Do you doubt - \"\n \"I doubt nothing where our deity is concerned,\" Jarlaxle promptly interrupted. \"The earring, your beacon, has been delivered as you instructed, and the human is well on his way.\" The mercenary swept into a respectfully low bow, tipping his wide-brimmed hat.\n Vierna calmed and seemed appeased. Her red eyes flashed eagerly, and a devious, pearly smile widened across her face. \"And the goblins?\" she asked, her voice thick with anticipation.\n \"They will soon make contact with the greedy dwarves,\" Jarlaxle replied, \"to their dismay, no doubt. My scouts are in place around the goblin ranks. If your brother makes an appearance in the inevitable battle, we will know.\" The mercenary hid his conniving smile at the sight of Vierna\u0027s obvious pleasure. The priestess thought to gain only the confirmation of her brother\u0027s whereabouts from the unfortunate goblin tribe, but Jarlaxle had much more in mind. Goblins and dwarves shared a mutual hatred as intense as that between the drow and their surface elf cousins, and any meeting between the groups would ensure a fight. What better opportunity for Jarlaxle to take an accurate measure of the d warven defenses ? And the d warven weaknesses?\n For, while Vierna\u0027s desires were focused - all that she $ wanted was the death of her traitorous brother - Jarlaxle was looking at the wider picture, of how this costly exploration up near the surface, perhaps even onto the surface, might become more profitable.\n Vierna rubbed her hands together and turned sharply to face her brother. Jarlaxle nearly laughed aloud at Dinin\u0027s feeble attempt to imitate his sister\u0027s beaming expression.\n Vierna was too obsessed to notice her less-than-enthusiastic brother\u0027s obvious slip. \"The goblin fodder understand their options?\" she asked the mercenary, but she answered her own question before Jarlaxle could reply. \"Of course, they have no options!\"\n Jarlaxle felt the sudden need to burst her eager bubble. \"What if the goblins kill Drizzt?\" he asked, sounding innocent.\n Vierna\u0027s face screwed up weirdly and she stammered unsuccessfully at her first attempts at a reply. \"No!\" she decided at length. \"\\Sfe know that more than a thousand dwarves inhabit the complex, perhaps two or three times that number. The goblin tribe will be crushed.\"\n \"But the dwarves and their allies will suffer some casualties,\" Jarlaxle reasoned.\n \"Not Drizzt,\" Dinin unexpectedly answered, and there was no compromise in his grim tone, and no argument forthcoming from either of his companions. \"No goblin will kill Drizzt. No goblin weapon could get near his body.\"\n Vierna\u0027s approving smile showed that she did not understand the sincere terror behind Dinin\u0027s claims. Dinin alone among the group had faced off in battle against Drizzt.\n \"The tunnels back to the city are clear?\" Vierna asked Jarlaxle, and, on his nod, she swiftly departed, having no more time for banter.\n \"You wish this to end,\" the mercenary remarked to Dinin when they were alone.\n \"You have not met my brother,\" Dinin replied evenly, and his hand instinctively twitched near the hilt of his magnificent draw-made sword, as though the mere mention of Drizzt put him on the defensive. \"Not in combat, at least.\"\n \"Fear, Khal\u0027abbiR\" The question went straight to\n Dinin\u0027s sense of honor, sounded more like a taunt.\n Still, the fighter made no attempt to deny it.\n \"You should fear your sister as well,\" Jarlaxle reasoned, and he meant every word. Dinin donned a disgusted expression.\n \"The Spider Queen, or one of Lloth\u0027s minions, has been talking with that one \" Jarlaxle added, as much to himself as to his shaken companion. At first glance, Vierna\u0027s obsession seemed a desperate, dangerous thing, but Jarlaxle had been around the chaos of Menzoberranzan long enough to realize that many other powerful figures, Matron Baenre included, had held similar, seemingly outrageous fantasies.\n Nearly every important figure in Menzoberranzan, including members of the ruling council, had come to power through acts that seemed desperate, had squirmed their way through the barbed nets of chaos to find their glory.\n Might Vierna be the next to cross that dangerous terrain? \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-cleric-quintet-night-masks-the-cleric-quintet-3/page-23.html","bookId":2109,"book":{"id":2109,"title":"The Cleric Quintet: Night Masks (The Cleric Quintet #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Caradoon, city of shadows, city of assassins.
