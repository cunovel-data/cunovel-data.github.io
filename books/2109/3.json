She looked back to the slope, where Ivan and Pikel still tried to make their way to where Shayleigh waited. They almost made it this time, but apparently Ivan muttered something that offended his brother, for Pikel sprang upon him and the two rolled down once more. The elf maiden threw up her hands in surrender and sprinted the rest of the way to Danica and Elbereth. As soon as she joined the two, her smile was replaced by a curious expression. She studied Danica\u0027s face for a moment, then commented matter-of-factly, \"You are leaving.\" Danica did not respond, could hardly look the elven maiden in the face. \"When?\" Shayleigh asked, her tone still calm and composed. \"Soon - perhaps tomorrow,\" Danica replied, Shayleigh spent a long moment considering the bittersweet news. Danica was leaving after the victory, with the forest secured. She could return, or the elves could go to her, freely, with little threat of goblins and ores. \"I applaud your choice,\" Shayleigh said evenly. Danica turned to regard her, caught off guard by the elf s approval. \"The fight here is won, at least for now,\" the elf maiden continued, gaily spinning a turn in the clean and crisp evening air. \"You have many duties to attend to, and, of course, you have studies back at the Edificant Library.\" \"I expect that Ivan and Pikel will accompany me,\" Danica replied. \"They also have duties at the library.\" Shayleigh nodded and looked back to the slope, where the brothers were trying a third time to get all the way up. At that angle, in the clear starlight, Danica could see the sincere admiration in the elf maiden\u0027s violet eyes. Danica understood that Shayleigh had put on her carefree attitude because she believed Danica\u0027s decision was the right one, not because she was pleased that Danica and the dwarves would soon depart. \"If the fight begins anew in the spring . . .\" Shayleigh started to say. \"Wfe will be back,\" Danica assured her. \"Back where?\" Ivan finally came up, shook from his yellow beard the twigs and leaves that had gotten caught up in it from his two rolls down the hill, and tucked it into his wide belt. \"Back to Shilmista \" Shayleigh explained. \"If the fighting begins anew.\" \"Wfe going somewhere?\" Ivan asked Danica. \"Uh-oh,\" moaned Pikel, beginning to understand. \"The first blows of winter will be upon us soon,\" Danica replied. \"The trails through the Snowflakes will become impassable.\" \"Uh-oh,\" Pikel said again. \"Ye\u0027re right,\" Ivan said after thinking things over for a moment. \"Things\u0027re settling here - not much left to hit. Me and me brother\u0027d get bored soon enough, and besides, them priests at the library probably ain\u0027t had a good-cooked meal since we left!\" Shayleigh slapped Ivan on the side of the head. Ivan turned to stare incredulously into her wistful smile, and even the gruff dwarf could recognize the pain hidden beneath the fair maiden\u0027s delicate features. \"You still owe me a fight,\" Shayleigh explained. Ivan snorted and cleared his throat, sneakily moving his shirt sleeve high enough to wipe the moisture from his eyes as he ran his sleeve across his nose. Danica was amazed by the obvious chink in the dwarfs callous demeanor. \"Bah!\" Ivan growled. \"What fight? Ye\u0027re just like the other one!\" He waggled an accusing finger at Elbereth, whom he had battled to a draw in a similar challenge just a few weeks before. \"\\e\u0027d dance all about and run in circles untfl we both fell down tired!\" \"Do you think I would release you from the insult you gave my people?\" Shayleigh snarled, hands on hips, and moved over to tower above the dwarf. \"Ye think I\u0027d let ye?\" Ivan retorted, poking a stubby finger into Shayleigh\u0027s belly. \"Bah!\" Ivan snorted, and he turned and stormed away. \"Bah!\" Shayleigh mimicked, her voice too melodic to properly copy the dwarfs grating tone. Ivan spun back and glowered at her, then motioned for Pikel to follow him away, \"flfell, ye got yer wood back, elf,\" Ivan said to Elbereth. \"Ye\u0027re welcome!\" \"Farewell to you, too, Ivan Bouldershoulder\" Elbereth replied. \"Our thanks to you and your splendid brother. Know that Shiimista will be open to either of you if you choose to pass this way again.\" Ivan smiled Pikel\u0027s way. \"As if that one could stop us anyhow!\" he roared, and he slapped Shayleigh across the rump and darted away before she recovered enough to respond. \"I must go as well,\" Danica said to Elbereth. \"I have many preparations to make before dawn.\" Elbereth nodded but could not reply past the lump in his throat. As soon as Danica was gone, skipping down the slope to catch up with the dwarves, Shayleigh took a seat beside the silver-eyed elf king. \"You love her\" the elf maiden remarked after a few silent moments. Elbereth sat quietly for a while, then admitted, \"With all my heart.\" \"And she loves Cadderfy,\" said Shayleigh. \"With all her heart,\" Elbereth replied somberly. Shayleigh managed a weak grin, trying to bolster her friend\u0027s resolve. \"Never would I have believed that an elf king of Shiimista would fall in love with a human!\" Shayleigh spouted, nudging Elbereth in the shoulder. The elf turned his silver-eyed gaze upon her and smiled wryly. \"Nor I that an elf maiden would be enchanted by a yellow-bearded dwarf,\" he replied. Shayleigh\u0027s initial reaction came out as an incredulous burst of laughter. Certainly Shayleigh had come to know Ivan and Pikel as friends, and trusted allies, but to hint at anything more than that was simply ridiculous. Still, the el-ven maiden quieted considerably when she looked down the now empty slope. Empty indeed did it seem with the Bouldershoulder brothers gone from view. A Long Time to Dawnogo Rath tentatively knocked on the door of the small conference room. He was never se-cure in his dealings with the dreaded Night Masks. A score of assassins had accompanied the two Night Mask leaders into Castle Trinity that same morning, many more trained killers than Bogo had anticipated for such a seemingly simple execution. Black-robed sentries searched the young wizard before he was allowed entry. These two were unremarkable enough, Bogo noted, probably beginners in the dark band. They wore the customary dress of Vfestgate\u0027s assassin guild, nondescript yeoman\u0027s clothes and silver-edged black eye masks. One sentry\u0027s tusky grin made Bogo think his heritage might be more ore than human, something common in the underground band, and that thought sent a shudder along the young wizard\u0027s spine. Whether these two were human or not, though, Bogo would not have been comfortable. He knew that, while the assassins openly displayed no weapons, each of them car- ried many and were trained to kill with their bare hands as well. When the searching was done, the two guards led the young wizard into the room, then stepped back to the door, standing impassively on either side of the portal. Bogo forgot about them as soon as they were behind him, for the young wizard found the two persons inside the comfortable room much more interesting. Closest to him sat a puny man - if it was a man - effeminate and obviously weak, issuing a steady stream of phlegm-filled coughs. The man showed no beard at all, not even stubble; his face was too clean and soft-looking to be an adult\u0027s. His heavy eyelids drooped lazily, and his lips, too thick and too fall, seemed almost a childlike caricature. Across the way sat the man\u0027s opposite, a thick-muscled, robust specimen with a full, thick beard and shock of hair, both flaming red, and arms that could snap Bogo in half with little effort. Still, this powerful man seemed even more out of place (from what Bogo knew of the Night Masks) than did the weakling. He brandished a huge sword on his girdle and bore the scars of many battles. His dress, too, was far from that preferred by assassins. Wide, studded bracers, glittering with dozens of small jewels, adorned the man\u0027s wrists, and his snow-white traveling cloak had been cut from the back of a northern bear, albeit a small one. \"You are Bogo Rath?\" the large man asked in a smooth baritone, with an articulation that was sharper and more sophisticated than Bogo had expected. The wizard nodded, \"\\\\fell met, fellow Night Mask,\" the young wizard replied with a low bow. The red-haired man gave him a curious look. \"I was not told you retained any connection to the guild,\" he said. \"I was informed that you left the band of mutual consent.\" Bogo shifted nervously from foot to foot. He had paid a huge sum to be allowed out of the Night Masks three years earlier, and even with the bribe, if it hadn\u0027t been for the fact that his father was an influential merchant in Westgate - one with political associations and ties to the dark guild - Bogo would have been given the customary send-off for one who could not meet the Night Masks\u0027 standards: death. \"It is unusual to see a person who can claim that he once belonged to our beloved brotherhood,\" the red-haired man teased, his cultured voice dripping with sarcasm. Again Bogo shifted, and he had to remind himself that this was Castle Trinity, his home, and that Aballister and Dorigen, for all their taunts, would look out for him. \"It was an unusual circumstance,\" the young wizard replied, revealing his nervousness with an uneasy flip of his stringy brown hair. \"I had another calling, one that took me far from Vfestgate. As you can see, my departure has done us both some good. I have attained a level of power that you cannot comprehend, and you shall be paid well for doing me this one small task.\" The huge man grinned, seeming to mock Bogo\u0027s claims of power, and looked to his puny companion, who seemed none too pleased by this whole business. \"Do sit with us,\" the large man bade Bogo. \"I am Van-der, the taskmaster for this small bit of business of which you speak. My associate is Ghost, a most unusual and talented man.\" Bogo took a seat between the two, alternating his gaze to try to find dues about his untrusted associates. \"Is there a problem?\" Vander asked him after studying Bogo\u0027s actions for a moment. \"No,\" Bogo blurted immediately. He forced himself to calm down. \"I am just surprised that so many have been sent for so simple an execution,\" he admitted. Vander laughed aloud, but then stopped abruptly, a curious expression crossing his face. His glower fell over Ghost as his body went into a series of convulsions, and then, to Bogo\u0027s amazement, Vander and his possessions began to grow. The sword, huge to begin with, took on gigantic proportions, and the northern bear that comprised the fine cloak no longer seemed a cub. Because Vander was seated, Bogo couldn\u0027t tell just exactly how large the man became - at least ten feet tall, he guessed. \"Firbolg?\" he asked as much as stated, recognizing the giant for what it was. Now Bogo was at a loss. Having a huge, red-haired man, so easily distinguishable, in the Night Masks, was stunning enough, but a firbolg? Ifcnder\u0027s angry glare did not relent. His dark eyes peered intently at Ghost from under his bushy brows. He regained his composure quickly, though, and rested back in his seat. \"Forgive me,\" he said unexpectedly to Bogo. \"I am indeed of the race of giant-kin, though I do not openly reveal my more-than-human stature.\" \"Then why - ?\" Bogo began to ask. \"An indiscretion \" Vander quickly interrupted, the tone of his deep voice indicating that he did not wish to continue. Bogo wasn\u0027t about to argue with an eight-hundred-pound giant. He crossed his hands defensively over his lap and tried hard to appear relaxed. \"You question our number?\" Vander asked, going back to the wizard\u0027s original inquiry. \"I did not expect so many\" Bogo reiterated. \"The Night Masks take no chances,\" Vander replied evenly. \"Often executions appearing \u0027so simple\u0027 prove the most difficult. Vfe do not make mistakes. That is why we are so well rewarded for our efforts.\" He cocked his giant head to one side - a curiously ungiantlike action, Bogo thought - and looked to the pouch on Bogo\u0027s rope belt. Taking the cue, the young wizard pulled the bag of gold from his belt and handed it to Vander. \"Half payment,\" he explained, \"as was agreed to by your superiors.\" \"And by yours,\" Vander was quick to remark, not willing to give Bogo the upper hand, \"a wizard named Aballister, I believe.\" Bogo did not respond, did not confirm or deny the claim. \"And you will accompany us as a representative of Castle Trinity in this matter?\" Vander stated as much as asked. \"Another unusual circumstance.\" \"That, too, was agreed upon,\" Bogo replied firmly, though the way he continually moved his fingers defeated the conviction in his tone. \"By both parties,\" he prudently added, \"most likely because I was once a member of your guild and understand your ways.\" Vander stifled his urge to deflate the pretentious young man\u0027s swelling ego. The giant knew that Aballister had paid a considerable amount of extra gold to get Bogo included, and that the young wizard\u0027s assignment had nothing to do with Bogo\u0027s past employment with the assassin band. \"I will journey to Carradoon beside you,\" Bogo continued, \"to offer a full report to my sup - associates.\" Vander smiled widely, catching the slip. \"Whatever role you might play in the death of Cadderly does not change the sum owed the Night Masks,\" he said grimly. Bogo nodded. \"My role will be as observer, nothing more, unless, of course, you, as taskmaster, decide otherwise,\" he agreed. \"Might I enquire of your own role?\" Bogo paused. He knew he might be overstepping his bounds, but he could not let Vander have such an obvious advantage in their dealings. \"It seems unlikely that a firbolg could parade through the streets of Carradoon. And what of the Ghost?\" \"He is called Ghost, not \u0027the Ghost,\u0027 \" Vander snapped. \"You would do well to remember that. My own role,\" he continued, mellowing a bit, \"is none of your concern.\" It struck Bogo as more than a little curious that \\fonder took more offense at his concerns for Ghost than for himself, particularly since Bogo had directly questioned the fir-bolg\u0027s value. \"Ghost will lead the way in, gather information, and prepare the target,\" Vander went on. \"I have twenty skilled assassins at my disposal, so we will need to secure a base near, but not within, the walls of Carradoon.\" Bogo nodded at the simple logic. \"Wfe will leave in the morning, then,\" Vander continued. \"Are you prepared?\" \"Of course.\" \"Then our meeting is concluded,\" Vander stated abruptly, flatly, motioning to the door. Immediately the two black-robed sentries moved to each side of Bogo to escort him from the room. Bogo looked back at the door many times as he made his way slowly down the corridor. A firbolg and a weakling? It seemed very unusual, but then, Bogo had been in the Night Masks only a day more than a month before he had begged to leave, and he had to admit, at least to himself, that he knew very little about the band\u0027s methods. Bogo soon dismissed all thoughts of Vander and Ghost, concentrating instead on another meeting he had planned. At Aballister\u0027s request, Bogo would meet with Druzil to learn all he could about Cadderly and his cohorts. The imp had dealt with Cadderly on two occasions - both disastrous for Castle Trinity - and knew as much about him as anyone. Bogo desperately wanted that knowledge. He was a bit dismayed that so many Night Masks had been assigned to this task, not because he wanted Cadderly to have a chance to escape, but because he wanted to be in on the action. More than anything else, Bogo Rath wanted to play a vital role in the kill, wanted to gain the respect of Aballister and, particularly, Dorigen. He was tired of the taunts, of being referred to as Boy-go. How would mighty Dorigen, who returned from Shilmista stripped of her valuable possessions and with her hands broken and swollen, feel when Bogo delivered the head of Aballister\u0027s troublesome son? Cadderly, after all, had been the source of Dorigen\u0027s humiliation. Bogo dared to dream that he might ascend within Castle Trinity\u0027s hierarchy to become Aballister\u0027s second. Dorigen\u0027s hands were stow to heal; the fortress\u0027s clerics doubted that many of her fingers would ever straighten. Given that precise movements played a vital role in spell casting, who could guess the implications to Dorigen\u0027s power? Bogo rubbed his soft hands together eagerly and sped off for the meeting room, to where Druzil, his guide to a better fife, waited. \"How dare you do that to me!\" the firbolg growled at his companion as soon as Bogo had gone. A nod from him sent the two guards scrambling from the room. The giant leaped from his seat and threateningly advanced a step. \"I did not know that my ... that your . . . body\u0027s size would return to normal,\" the little man protested, trying to sink deeper into the cushions of his soft chair. \"I believed the enchantment would last longer, at least through the meeting.\" The firbolg grabbed the little man by the collar and hoisted him into the air. \"Ah, Vander,\" the giant purred, his features too calm, \"dear Vander.\" The firbolg\u0027s face contorted suddenly in rage and he punched the little man in the face, destroying his nose. A backhand slap raised a welt on one cheek; a second slap did likewise on the other. Then, with an evil grin, the firbolg grabbed the little man by one forearm and snapped his bone so severely that the man\u0027s fingers brushed against his elbow. The beating went on for many minutes, and finally the firbolg dropped the barely conscious man back to his seat. \"If you ever deceive me so again . . .\" the red-haired giant warned. \"If ever again you humiliate me in front of one such as Bogo Rath, I will torment you until you beg for death!\" The smaller man, the real Vander, curled up in a fetal position, cradling his shattered arm, feeling terribly vulnerable and afraid trapped inside the puny body of the weakling, Ghost. \"I want my body back,\" Ghost said suddenly, tugging uncomfortably at his firbolg trappings. \"You are so hairy and itchy!\" Vander sat up and nodded, eager to be back in his own form. \"Not now,\" Ghost growled at him. \"Not until the wounds heal. I would not accept my body back in less than perfect condition,\" he said wryly. \"As it was when I gave it to you.\" Vander slumped back. This game had grown quite old over the last few years, but what options lay before him? He couldn\u0027t escape Ghost\u0027s evil clutches, couldn\u0027t resist the demands of Ghost\u0027s magic. %nder wanted nothing more than to get back into his firbolg form and pound the little man, but he knew that Ghost would simply initiate a switch back, and then Vander would feel the pain of his own attacks. Ghost would continue the beating, %nder knew, for hours sometimes, until poor Vuider broke and wept openly, and begged his master to stop. The trapped firbolg put a hand to his broken human nose. Already it was on the mend; the pain was no more and the blood flow had stopped. The broken forearm had straightened again and Vander could feel tingling as the bones knitted. Just a few more minutes, he thought to comfort himself, and I will have my body back, my own strong body. \"I will be leaving this hour,\" Ghost said to him. He pointed a threatening finger Vander\u0027s way. \"Remember that you are my spirit-mate,\" he warned. \"I can come back for you, just for you, Vander, from any distance, at any time.\" Finder averted his eyes, unable to deny the threat. Once he had tried to flee this nightmare, had gotten all the way home to the Spine of the Wbrld Mountains, but Ghost, thousands of miles away, had found him and forced a body switch. Merely to show Finder the folly of his actions, Ghost mercilessly had slaughtered several of Vander\u0027s fellow firbolgs, including his brother, on a little-used mountain trail east of Mirabar. Vander vividly remembered the terrible moment when Ghost had given him back his body, holding his oldest son\u0027s left arm in his gigantic hand. Afonder had killed Ghost when he returned to Wsstgate, had nearly torn the little man\u0027s head from his shoulders, but, a week later, Ghost had walked into \\\u0026nder\u0027s camp, smiling. Finder came out of his contemplations and regarded his hated companion. Ghost towered above him, a black glove on one hand, a white one on the other, and wearing a famil- iar golden-edged mirror hanging on a golden chain around his neck. At the clap of the firbolg\u0027s hands, %nder felt himself floating. His noncorporeal spirit looked back to the weak, drowsy form on the floor with contempt, then looked ahead to the giant receptacle. There came a flash of burning pain as kinder entered his firbolg body. His spirit twisted about and shifted to reconfigure itself to the proper form, to reorient Vander to his new coil. Ghost had come out of the spirit-walk faster than %nder, as always, and was sitting comfortably in a chair, watching the firbolg intently, as Vander came back to consciousness. The puny body now wore the gloves and mirror; the magic device always transferred with its master. As soon as it became obvious that %nder would not attack him, Ghost clenched his hands and closed his eyes. The gloves and mirror disappeared, but Vander knew from bitter and painful experience that they were well within immediate recall. \"You will depart as planned with the band and the young wizard,\" Ghost instructed. \"What of this Bogo Rath?\" Vander asked. \"I do not trust him.\" \"That is of no consequence,\" Ghost replied. \"After all, you do not trust me, either, but I know you are enamored of my warm personality.\" Vander wanted to smash the smug smile off Ghost\u0027s steepy-eyed face. \"The wizard is to accompany us,\" Ghost instructed. \"AbalKster paid us handsomely to take Rath along, a fine cache of gold for so minor an inconvenience.\" \"To what purpose?\" Vander had to ask, always amazed at the webs of seemingly pointless intrigue created by tess-than-honorable people. \"Aballister believes that sending an emissary will keep him informed,\" Ghost replied. \"The wizard has a weakness for knowledge. He cannot tolerate the occurrence of anything that affects him, directly or even indirectly, without his knowledge.\" Finder did not disagree. He had met Aballister only once, and Ghost had spoken with the hollow-featured wizard no more than three times. But the firbolg didn\u0027t doubt Ghost\u0027s perceptions. The little man possessed an uncanny understanding of character, particularly of character flaws, and always found a way to use that to his advantage. The young scholar blinked at the morning brightness, shining across Impresk Lake and through the windows of his room\u0027s balcony doors. Breakfast sat on the table next to Cadderly - extra portions, he noted, and he smiled. They were a bribe, Brennan\u0027s way of saying thank you for Cadderry\u0027s continued discretion. Fredegar wouldn\u0027t be happy with his son if he knew where Brennan had spent the evening. Cadderly was indeed hungry, and the food looked good, but when the young scholar noticed the Tome of Universal Harmony sitting open on his desk by the window, he realized a more profound and demanding hunger. He took a single biscuit with him as he went to the desk. t Like so many times before, Cadderly devoured the pages, the blurred words, faster than his eyes could follow. He was through the tome in a matter of minutes, then turned it back over and began again, rushing, almost desperately, to keep the mysterious song flowing uninterrupted. How many times Cadderly went through the work that day, he could not know. When Brennan came in with his lunch, then his supper, he did not look up from his reading, from his listening to the song. The daylight waned, and still Cadderly pored on. His first thought, when the room became too dark to read in, was to go and light his lamp, but he hated to waste the time that action would take. Hardly considering his actions, Cadderly recalled a page in the tome, a particular melody, and uttered a few simple words, and instantly the room was filled with light. The stream of the song was broken. Cadderly sat blinking in amazement at what he had done. He retraced his mental steps, recalled that same page, its image clear in his mind. He uttered the chant again, changing his inflections and alternating two of the words. The light went out.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-cleric-quintet-night-masks-the-cleric-quintet-3/page-3.html","bookId":2109,"book":{"id":2109,"title":"The Cleric Quintet: Night Masks (The Cleric Quintet #3)","description":"Storyline: Caradoon, city of shadows, city of assassins.
