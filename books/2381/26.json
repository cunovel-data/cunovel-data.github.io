You know, stuff that’s more…” She paused, searching for an adjective.\n “Hooters-y?” Aria suggested jokily.\n “Yes!” The girl smiled. When she sashayed away again, Aria snorted and poked Mike with a fry. “What do you think Meredith goes by here. Randi? Fifi? Oh! What about Caitlin? That’s really perky, right?”\n “Would you stop?” Mike exploded. “I don’t want to hear anything about…about her, okay?”\n Aria blinked, sitting back.\n Mike’s face flushed. “You think this is the big thing that’s going to make things right? Shoving the fact that Dad is with someone else in my face yet again?” He stuffed a bunch of fries in his mouth and looked away. “It doesn’t matter. I’m over it.”\n “I wanted to make everything up to you,” Aria squeaked. “I wanted to make this all better.”\n Mike let out a guffaw. “There’s nothing you can do, Aria. You’ve ruined my life.”\n “I didn’t ruin anything!” Aria gasped.\n Mike’s ice-blue eyes narrowed. He threw his napkin on the table, stood up, and shoved his arm into his anorak sleeve. “I have to get to lacrosse.”\n “Wait!” Aria grabbed his belt loop. Suddenly, she felt like she was going to cry. “Don’t go,” Aria wailed. “Mike, please. My life is ruined too. And not just because of Dad and Meredith. Because of…of something else.”\n Mike glanced at her over his shoulder. “What are you talking about?”\n “Sit back down,” Aria said desperately. A long second passed. Mike grunted, then sat. Aria stared at their plate of fries, working up the courage to speak. She overheard two men discussing the Eagles’ defensive tactics. A used-car-dealership commercial on the flat-screen TV above the bar featured a man in a chicken suit babbling about deals that were more cluck for your buck.\n “I’ve been getting these threats from someone,” Aria whispered. “Someone who knows everything about me. The person who’s been threatening me even tipped off Ella about Byron and Meredith’s relationship. Some of my friends have been getting messages, too, and we think the person writing them is behind Hanna’s hit-and-run accident. I even got a message about Meredith working here. I don’t know how this person knows all of this stuff, but they just…do.” She shrugged, trailing off.\n Two more commercials passed before Mike spoke. “You have a stalker?”\n Aria nodded miserably.\n Mike blinked, confounded. He gestured to the booth of cops. “Have you told any of them?”\n Aria shook her head. “I can’t.”\n “Of course you can. We can tell them right now.”\n “I have it under control,” Aria said through her teeth. She pressed her fingers to her temples. “Maybe I shouldn’t have told you.”\n Mike leaned forward. “Don’t you remember all the freaky shit that’s happened in this town? You have to tell someone.”\n “Why do you care?” Aria snapped, her body filling with anger. “I thought you hated me. I thought I ruined your life.”\n Mike’s face went slack. His Adam’s apple bobbed as he swallowed. When he stood up, he seemed taller than Aria remembered. Stronger, too. Maybe it was from all of the lacrosse he’d been playing, or maybe it was because he was the man of the house these days. He snatched Aria’s wrist and pulled her to her feet. “You’re telling them.”\n Aria’s lip wobbled. “But what if it’s not safe?”\n “What’s unsafe is not telling,” Mike urged. “And…and I’ll keep you safe. Okay?”\n Aria’s heart felt like a brownie, straight out of the oven—all gooey and warm and a little melted. She smiled unsteadily, then glanced at the blinking neon sign above the Hooters’ dining room. It said, DELIGHTFULLY TACKY, YET UNREFINED. But the sign was broken; all the letters were dark except for tacky’s lowercase A, which flickered menacingly. When Aria shut her eyes, the A still remained, glowing like the sun.\n She took a deep breath. “Okay,” she whispered.\n Just as she moved away from Mike toward the cops, the waitress returned with their check. As the girl turned to leave, Mike got a sneaky look on his face, reached both his hands out, and squeezed the air, mimicking squeezing the girl’s tight, orange satin–clad butt. He caught Aria’s eye and winked.\n It looked like the real Mike Montgomery was back. Aria had missed him.\n 27\n BIZARRE LOVE TRIANGLE\n Friday night, just before the limo was supposed to arrive to escort Hanna to her party, Hanna stood in her bedroom, twirling around in her brightly printed Nieves Lavi dress. She was finally a perfect size two, thanks to a diet of IV fluids and facial stitches that made it too painful to chew solid foods.\n “That looks great on you,” a voice called. “Except I think you’re a tad too thin.”\n Hanna whirled around. In his black wool suit, dark purple tie, and purple-striped button-down, her father looked like George Clooney circa Ocean’s Eleven. “I’m so not too thin,” she answered quickly, trying to hide her thrill. “Kate’s way thinner than me.”\n Her father’s face clouded over, perhaps at the mention of his perfect, poised, yet incredibly evil quasi-stepdaughter. “What are you doing here, anyway?” Hanna demanded.\n “Your mom let me in.” He walked into Hanna’s room and sat down on her bed. Hanna’s stomach flipped. Her dad hadn’t been in her bedroom since she was twelve, right before he moved out. “She said I could change here for your big party.”\n “You’re coming?” Hanna squawked.\n “Am I allowed?” her father asked.\n “I…I guess so.” Spencer’s parents were coming, as well as some Rosewood Day faculty and staff. “But, I mean, I thought you’d want to get back to Annapolis…and Kate and Isabel. You’ve been away from them for almost a week, after all.” She couldn’t hide the bitterness in her voice.\n “Hanna…” her father started. Hanna turned away. She suddenly felt so angry that her dad had left her family, that he was here now, that maybe he loved Kate more than he loved her—not to mention that she had scars all over her face and that her memory about Saturday night still hadn’t returned. She felt tears in her eyes, which made her even angrier.\n “Come here.” Her father put his strong arms around her, and when she pressed her head to his chest, she could hear his heart beating.\n “You okay?” he asked her.\n A horn honked outside. Hanna pulled back her bamboo blinds and saw the limo Mona had arranged waiting in her driveway, its wipers moving furiously over the windshield to keep off the rain. “I’m great,” she said suddenly, the whole world tipping up again. She slid her Dior mask over her face. “I’m Hanna Marin, and I’m fabulous.”\n Her father handed Hanna a huge black golf umbrella. “You definitely are,” he said. And for the first time ever, Hanna thought she just might believe him.\n What seemed like only seconds later, Hanna was perched atop a pillow-laden platform, trying to keep the balcony’s tassels from knocking off her Dior mask. Four gorgeous man-slaves had hoisted her up, and they were now beginning their slow parade into the party tent on the fifteenth green of the Rosewood Country Club.\n “Presenting…in her big return to Rosewood…the fabulous Hanna Marin!” Mona screamed into a microphone. As the crowd erupted, Hanna waved her arms around excitedly. All of her guests were wearing masks, and Mona and Spencer had transformed the tent into the Salon de l’Europe at Le Casino in Monte-Carlo, Monaco. It had faux-marble walls, dramatic frescoes, and roulette and card tables. Sleek, gorgeous boys roamed the room with trays of canapés, manned the tents’ two bars, and acted as croupiers at the gambling tables. Hanna had demanded that none of her party’s staff be female.\n The DJ switched to a new White Stripes song and everyone began to dance. A thin, pale hand caught Hanna’s arm, and Mona dragged her through the crowd and gave her a huge hug.\n “Do you love it?” Mona cried from behind her expressionless mask, which looked similar to Hanna’s Dior masterpiece.\n “Naturally.” Hanna bumped her hip. “And I love the gambling tables. Does anyone win anything?”\n “They win a hot night with a hot girl—you, Hanna!” Spencer cried, prancing up behind them. Mona grabbed her hand, too, and the three jiggled with glee. Spencer looked like a blond Audrey Hepburn in her black satin trapeze dress and adorable round-toe flats. When Spencer put her arm around Mona’s shoulders, Hanna’s heart leaped. As much as she didn’t want to give A credit for anything, A’s notes to Mona had made Mona accept Hanna’s old friends. Yesterday, in between rounds of their Mandy Moore drinking game, Mona had told Hanna, “You know, Spencer’s really cool. I think she could be part of our posse.” Hanna had waited years for Mona to say something like that.\n “You look great,” a voice said in Hanna’s ear. A boy stood behind her, dressed in fitted pin-striped pants, a white long-sleeved button-down, a matching pin-striped vest, and a long-nosed bird mask. Lucas’s telltale white-blond hair peeked out from the mask’s top. When he reached out and clasped her hand, Hanna’s heart started racing. She held it for a second, squeezed, and let it drop before anyone could see. “This party is awesome,” Lucas said.\n “Thanks, it was nothing,” Mona piped in. She nudged Hanna. “Although, I don’t know, Han. Do you think that hideous thing Lucas is wearing qualifies as a mask?”\n Hanna glanced at Mona, wishing she could see her face. She looked over Lucas’s shoulder, pretending she’d been distracted by something that was going on over at the blackjack table.\n “So, Hanna, can I talk to you for a sec?” Lucas asked. “Alone?”\n Mona was now chatting with one of the waiters. “Um, okay,” Hanna mumbled.\n Lucas led her to a secluded nook and pulled off his mask. Hanna tried to thwart the tornado of nerves rumbling inside her stomach, avoiding looking anywhere near Lucas’s super-pink, super-kissable lips. “Can I take yours off, too?” he asked.\n Hanna made sure they were truly alone, and that no one else would be able to see her bare, scarred face, and then she let him lift off her mask. Lucas kissed her softly on her stitches. “I missed you,” he whispered.\n “You only saw me a couple hours ago.” Hanna giggled.\n Lucas smiled crookedly. “That seems like a long time.”\n They kissed for a few more minutes, snuggled together on a single couch cushion, oblivious to the cacophony of party noises. Then Hanna heard her name through the tent’s gauzy curtains. “Hanna?” Mona’s voice called. “Han? Where are you?”\n Hanna freaked. “I should go back out.” She picked up Lucas’s mask by its long bird beak and shoved it at him. “And you should put this back on.” \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/unbelievable-pretty-little-liars-4/page-26.html","bookId":2381,"book":{"id":2381,"title":"Unbelievable (Pretty Little Liars #4)","description":"Storyline: \n Unbelievable (Pretty Little Liars #4) \n Behind Rosewood\u0027s grand façades, where the air smells like apples and Chanel No. 5 and infinity pools sparkle in landscaped backyards, nothing is as it seems.
