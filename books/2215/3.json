{"id":103170,"no":3,"title":"Page 3","content":"2\n IN THE STILL CAF¨¦, I watched Merrick take another deep drink of the rum. I treasured the interval in which she let her eyes pass slowly over the dusty room.\n I let my mind return to that long ago night at Oak Haven, as the rain struck the windowpanes. The air had been warm and heavy with the scent of the oil lamps and the busy fire on the hearth. Spring was upon us but the storm had cooled the air. She\u0027d been speaking of the white family named Mayfair of whom she knew so little, she said.\n \"None of us with any sense would do that,\" she continued, \"go to those white cousins, expecting anything from any of them on account of a name.\" She had brushed it all aside. \"I\u0027m not going to white people and try to tell them that I\u0027m their own.\"\n Aaron had looked at me, his quick gray eyes concealing even his tenderest emotions, but I knew that he wanted me to respond.\n \"There\u0027s no need, child,\" I had said. \"You are ours now, if you choose to be. We are your own. Why, it\u0027s already understood. This is your home forever. Only you can change things, if you wish.\"\n A chill had come over me, of something momentous and meaningful, when I\u0027d spoken those words to her. I had indulged the pleasure. \"We\u0027ll always take care of you.\" I had underscored it, and I might have kissed her had she not been so ripe and pretty, with her bare feet on the flowered carpet and her breasts naked beneath her shift.\n She had not replied.\n \"All gentlemen and ladies, it seems,\" Aaron had said, perusing the daguerreotypes. \"And in such excellent condition, these little portraits.\" He had sighed. \"Ah, what a wonder it must have been in the 1840s when they learnt to take these pictures.\"\n \"Oh, yes, my great\u001egreat uncle wrote all about it,\" she had said. \"I don\u0027t know if anyone can read those pages anymore. They were crumbling to bits when Great Nananne first showed them to me. But as I was saying, these are all his pictures. Here, the tintypes, he did those too.\" She had a woman\u0027s weariness in her sigh, as though she\u0027d lived it all. \"He died very old, they say, with a house full of pictures, before his white nephews came and actually broke them up¡ªbut I\u0027ll come to that.\"\n I had been shocked and bruised by such a revelation, unable to excuse it. Broken daguerreotypes. Faces lost forever. She had gone on, lifting the small rectangles of tin, many unframed yet clear, from her cardboard treasure chest.\n \"I open boxes sometimes from Great Nananne\u0027s rooms, and the paper is all little bits and pieces. I think the rats come and they eat the paper. Great Nananne says rats will eat your money and that\u0027s why you have to keep it in an iron box. Iron\u0027s magical, you know that. The sisters¡ªI mean the nuns¡ªthey don\u0027t know that. That\u0027s why in the Bible you couldn\u0027t build with an iron shovel, because iron was mighty and you couldn\u0027t put the iron shovel above the bricks of the Lord\u0027s temple, not then, and not now.\"\n It seemed a bizarre intelligence, though she had been most technically correct.\n She\u0027d let her words wander. \"Iron and shovels. It goes way back. The King of Babylon held a shovel in his hand with which he laid the bricks of the temple. And the Masons, now they keep that idea in their Order, and on the one\u001edollar bill you see that broken pyramid of bricks.\"\n It had amazed me, the case with which she touched on these complex concepts. What had she known in her life, I wondered. What sort of woman would she prove to be?\n I remember that she\u0027d been looking at me, as she\u0027d said those words, gauging my reaction, perhaps, and it had only then become clear to me how much she needed to talk of the things she\u0027d been taught, of the things she thought, of the things she\u0027d heard.\n \"But why are you so good?\" she had asked, searching my face rather politely. \"I know with priests and nuns why they\u0027re good to us. They come and bring food and clothes to us. But you, why are you good? Why did you let me in and give me a room here? Why do you let me do what I want? All day Saturday I looked at magazines and listened to the radio. Why do you feed me and try to get me to wear shoes?\"\n \"Child,\" Aaron had interjected. \"We\u0027re almost as old as the Church of Rome. We\u0027re as old as the orders of the sisters and the priests who\u0027ve visited you. Yes, older, I would say, than almost all.\"\n Still she had looked to me for an explanation.\n \"We have our beliefs and our traditions,\" I had said. \"It\u0027s common to be bad, to be greedy, to be corrupt and self\u001eseeking. It\u0027s a rare thing to love. We love.\"\n Again, I had enjoyed our sense of purpose, our commitment¡ªthat we were the inviolate Talamasca, that we cared for the outcast, that we harbored the sorcerer and the seer, that we had saved witches from the stake and reached out even to the wandering spirits, yes, even to the shades whom others fear. We had done it for well over a thousand years.\n \"But these little treasures¡ªyour family, your heritage,\" I\u0027d hastened to explain. \"They matter to us because they matter to you. And they will always be yours.\"\n She\u0027d nodded. I had got it right.\n \"Witchcraft\u0027s my calling card, Mr. Talbot,\" she\u0027d said shrewdly, \"but all this comes with me too.\"\n I had enjoyed the. fleeting enthusiasm which had illuminated her face.\n And now, some twenty years after, what had I done, seeking her out, finding her old house in New Orleans deserted, and spying upon her at Oak Haven, walking the broad upstairs galleries of Oak Haven like an old Penny Dreadful Vampire, looking into her very bedroom until she sat up and spoke my name in the darkness.\n I had done her evil, I knew it, and it was exciting, and I needed her, and I was selfish, and I missed her, and it was as plain as that.\n It had been only a week ago that I wrote to her.\n Alone in the town house in the Rue Royale, I\u0027d written by hand in a style that hadn\u0027t changed with my fortunes:\n Dear Merrick,\n Yes, it was I whom you saw on the porch outside your room.\n It was not my intention to frighten you but merely to solace myself by looking at you, playing the guardian angel, I must confess, if you will forgive me, as I hovered outside the window for the better part of the night.\n I have a request for you, which I make from my soul to yours. I cannot tell you what it is in this letter. I ask that you meet me in some place that is public, where you will feel safe from me, a place that you yourself choose. Answer at this post box, and I\u0027ll be prompt in replying. Merrick, forgive me. If you advise the Elders or the Superior General of this contact, they will in all likelihood forbid you to meet with me. Please give me this little while to speak with you before you take such a step.\n Yours in the Talamasca forever,\n David Talbot.\n What audacity and egoism to have written such a note and delivered it into the iron mailbox at the end of the drive in the hours before dawn.\n She\u0027d written back, a note rather tantalizing in its details, full of undeserved affection.\n I cannot wait to talk with you. Be assured, whatever shocks this meeting will hold in store for me, I seek you inside the mystery\u001e\u001eDavid, whom I have always loved. You were my Father when I needed you, and my friend ever after. And I have glimpsed you since your metamorphosis, perhaps more often than you know.\n I know what happened to you. I know of those with whom you live. The Caf¨¦ of the Lion. Rue St. Anne. Do you remember it? Years ago, before we ever went to Central America, we ate a quick lunch there. You were so wary of us setting out for those jungles. Do you remember how you argued? I think I used a witch\u0027s charms to persuade you. I always thought you knew. I\u0027ll come early each evening for several nights in hopes that you\u0027ll be there.\n She had signed the note exactly as I had signed my own:\n \"Yours in the Talamasca forever.\"\n I had put myself before my love of her, and my duty to her. I was relieved that the deed was done.\n Back then, when she\u0027d been the orphan in the storm, such a thing had been unthinkable. She was my duty, this little wanderer who had come so surprisingly, on her own, one evening to knock on our door.\n \"Our motives are the same as your motives,\" Aaron had said to her most directly on that long ago night at Oak Haven. He\u0027d reached out and lifted her soft brown hair back from her shoulder, as if he were her elder brother. \"We want to preserve knowledge. We want to save history. We want to study and we hope to understand.\"\n He had made another soft sigh, so unlike him.\n \"Ah, those white cousins, the Garden District Mayfairs, as you called them, and most correctly, yes, we know of them,\" he had admitted, surprising me, \"but we keep our secrets unless prompted by duty to reveal them. What is their long history to you just now? Their lives are interconnected like thorny vines forever circling and recircling the same tree. Your life might have nothing to do with that bitter struggle. What concerns us here now is what we can do for you. I don\u0027t speak idle words when I tell you that you may rely upon us forever. You are, as David has said, our own.\"\n She had reflected. It had not been simple for her to accept all of this, she was too used to being alone with Great Nananne¡ªyet something strong had impelled her to trust us before she\u0027d ever come.\n \"Great Nananne trusts you,\" she had said, as if I\u0027d asked her. \"Great Nananne said that I was to come to you. Great Nananne had one of her many dreams and woke up before daylight and rang her bell for me to come. I was sleeping on the screen porch and I came in and found her standing up in her white flannel gown. She\u0027s cold all the time, you know; she always wears flannel, even on the hottest night. She said for me to come sit down and listen to what she had dreamed.\"\n \"Tell me about it, child,\" Aaron had asked. Had they not spoken of this completely before I\u0027d come?\n \"She dreamed of Mr. Lightner, of you,\" she\u0027d said, looking to Aaron, \"and in the dream you came to her with Oncle Julien, white Oncle Julien from the clan uptown. And the two of you sat by her bed.\n \"Oncle Julien told her jokes and stories and said he was happy to be in her dream. She said that. Oncle Julien said that I was to go to you, you here, Mr. Lightner, and that Mr. Talbot would come. Oncle Julien spoke French and you yourself were sitting in the cane\u001ebacked chair and smiling and nodding to her, and you brought her in a cup of coffee and cream the way she likes it, with half a cup of sugar and one of her favorite silver spoons. In and out of her dreams, Great Nananne has a thousand silver spoons.\" The dream continued:\n \"You sat on her bed, finally, on her best quilt beside her, and you took her hand, and she had all her best rings on her hand, which she doesn\u0027t wear anymore, you know, and you said in the dream, \u0027You send me little Merrick,\u0027 and you said you\u0027d take care of me, and you told her that she was going to die.\"\n Aaron had not heard this strange recounting, and he\u0027d seemed quite taken, amazed. Lovingly, he\u0027d answered:\n \"It must have been Oncle Julien who said such a thing in the dream. How could I have known such a secret?\"\n I\u0027d never forgotten his protest, because it had been very unlike him to commit himself even to ignorance, and to press so hard upon such a point.\n \"No, no, you told her,\" the fairy child had said. \"You told her the day of the week and the hour of the clock, and it\u0027s yet to come.\" She had looked thoughtfully once more at her pictures. \"Don\u0027t worry about it. I know when it\u0027s going to happen.\" Her face had been suddenly full of sadness. \"I can\u0027t keep her forever. Les myst¨¨res will not wait.\"\n Les myst¨¨res. Did she mean the ancestors, the Voodoo gods, or merely the secrets of fate? I\u0027d been unable to penetrate her thoughts to any degree whatsoever.\n \"St. Peter will be waiting,\" she\u0027d murmured as the visible sadness had slowly receded behind her veil of calm.\n Quite suddenly, she\u0027d flashed her glance on me and murmured something in French. Papa Legba, god of the crossroads in Voodoo, for whom a statue of St. Peter with his keys to Heaven might do quite well.\n I had noted that Aaron could not bring himself to question her further on the matter of his role in the dream, the date of Great Nananne\u0027s imminent death. He had nodded, however, and once again, with both hands he\u0027d lifted her hair back from her damp neck where a few errant tendrils had clung to her soft creamy skin.\n Aaron had regarded her with honest wonder as she had gone on with her tale.\n \"First thing I knew after that dream, there was an old colored man and a truck ready to take me, and he said, \u0027You don\u0027t need your bag, you just come as you are,\u0027 and I climbed up into the truck with him, and he drove me all the way out here, not even talking to me, just listening to some old Blues radio station and smoking cigarettes the whole way. Great Nananne knew it was Oak Haven because Mr. Lightner told her in the dream....\n \"Great Nananne knew of Oak Haven of the old days, when it was a different kind of house with a different name. Oncle Julien told her lots of other things, but she didn\u0027t tell me what they were. She said, \u0027Go to them, The Talamasca; they\u0027ll take care of you, and it will be the way for you and all the things that you can do.\u0027 \"\n It had chilled: all the things that you can do. I remember Aaron\u0027s sad expression. He had only given a little shake of his head. Don\u0027t worry her now, I\u0027d thought a bit crossly, but the child had not been perturbed.\n Oncle Julien of Mayfair fame was no stranger to my memory; I had read many chapters on the career of this powerful witch and seer, the one male in his bizarre family to go against the goad of a male spirit and his female witches over many hundreds of years. Oncle Julien¡ªmentor, madman, cocksman, legend, father of witches¡ªand the child had said that she had come down from him.\n It had to be powerful magic, but Oncle Julien had been Aaron\u0027s field, not mine.\n She had watched me carefully as she spoke.\n \"I\u0027m not used to people believing me,\" she\u0027d said, \"but I am used to making people afraid.\"\n \"How so, child?\" I had asked. But she had frightened me quite enough with her remarkable poise and the penetration of her gaze. What could she do? Would I ever know? It had been worth pondering on that first evening, for it was not our way to encourage our orphans to give full vent to their dangerous powers; we had been devoutly passive in all such respects.\n I had banished my unseemly curiosity and set to memorizing her appearance, as was my custom in those days, by looking very carefully at every aspect of her visage and form.\n Her limbs had been beautifully molded; her breasts were already too fetching, and the features of her face were large, all of them¡ªwith no unique hint of the African\u001elarge her well\u001eshaped mouth, and large her almond eyes and long nose; her neck had been long and uncommonly graceful, and there had been a harmony to her face, even when she had fallen into the deepest thought.\n \"Keep your secrets of those white Mayfairs,\" she had said. \"Maybe someday we can swap secrets, you and me. They don\u0027t even know in these times that we are here. Great Nananne said that Oncle Julien died before she was born. In the dream, he didn\u0027t say a word about those white Mayfairs. He said for me to come here.\" She had gestured to the old glass photographs. \"These are my people. If I\u0027d been meant to go to those white Mayfairs, Great Nananne would have seen it long before now.\" She\u0027d paused, thoughtfully. \"Let\u0027s us just talk of those old times.\"\n She\u0027d spaced the daguerreotypes lovingly on the mahogany table. She made a neat row, wiping away the crumbly fragments with her hand. And at some moment, I\u0027d noted that all the little figures were upside down from her point of view, and right side up for Aaron and for me.\n \"There\u0027ve been white people kin to me that have come down here and tried to destroy records,\" she said, \"You know, tear the page right out of the church register that says their great\u001egrandmother was colored. Femme de couleur fibre, that\u0027s what some old records say in French.\n \"Imagine tearing up that much history, the page right out of the church register with all those births and deaths and marriages, and not wanting to know. Imagine going into my great\u001egreat oncle\u0027s house and breaking up those pictures, pictures that ought to be someplace safe for lots of people to see.\"\n She had sighed, rather like a weary woman, gazing down into the worn shoe box and its trophies.\n \"Now I have these pictures. I have everything, and I\u0027m with you, and they can\u0027t find me, and they can\u0027t throw all these things away.\"\n She had dipped her hand into the shoe box again and taken out the cartes de visite¡ªold photographs on cardboard from the last decades of the old century. I could see the high slanted letters in faded purple on the backs of these latest pictures as she turned them this way and that.\n \"See, this here is Oncle Vervain,\" she said. I had looked at the thin, handsome black\u001ehaired young man with the dark skin and light eyes like her own. It was rather a romantic portrait. In a finely tailored three\u001epiece suit, he stood with his arm on a Greek column before a painted sky. The picture was in rich sepia. The African blood was plainly present in the man\u0027s handsome nose and mouth.\n \"Now, this is dated 1920.\" She turned it over once, then back again, and laid it down for us to see. \"Oncle Vervain was a Voodoo Doctor,\" she said, \"and I knew him well before he died. I was little, but I\u0027ll never forget him. He could dance and spit the rum from between his teeth at the altar, and he had everybody scared, I can tell you.\"\n She took her time, then found what she wanted. Next picture.\n \"And you see here, this one?\" She had laid down another old photograph, this time of an elderly gray\u001ehaired man of color in a stately wooden chair. \"The Old Man is what they always called him. I don\u0027t even know him by any other name. He went back to Haiti to study the magic, and he taught Oncle Vervain all he knew. Sometimes I feel Oncle Vervain is talking to me. Sometimes I feel he\u0027s outside our house watching over Great Nananne. I saw the Old Man once in a dream.\"\n I had wanted so badly to ask questions, but this had not been the time.\n \"See here, this is Pretty Justine,\" she had said, laying down perhaps the most impressive portrait of all¡ªa studio picture on thick cardboard inside a sepia cardboard frame. \"Pretty Justine had everybody afraid of her.\" The young woman was indeed pretty, her breasts flat in the style of the 1920s her hair in a bob, her dark skin quite beautiful, her eyes and mouth slightly expressionless, or perhaps evincing a certain pain.\n Now came the modern snapshots, thin and curling, the work of common enough hand\u001eheld cameras of the present time.\n \"They were the worst¡ªhis sons,\" she had said as she pointed to the curling black\u001eand\u001ewhite picture. \"They were Pretty Justine\u0027s grandchildren, all white and living in New York. They wanted to get their hands on anything that said they were colored and tear it up. Great Nananne knew what they wanted. She didn\u0027t fall for their soft manners and the way they took me downtown and bought me pretty clothes. I still have those clothes. Little dresses nobody ever wore and little shoes with clean soles. They didn\u0027t leave us an address when they left. See, look at them in the picture. Look how anxious they are. But I did bad things to them.\"\n Aaron had shaken his head, studying the strange tense faces. As the pictures had disquieted me, I had kept my eyes on the womanish child.\n \"What did you do, Merrick?\" I had asked without biting my tongue wisely.\n \"Oh, you know, read their secrets in their palms and told them bad things they\u0027d always tried to cover up. It wasn\u0027t kind to do that, but I did it, just to make them go away. I told them our house was full of spirits. I made the spirits come. No, I didn\u0027t make them come. I called them and they came as I asked. Great Nananne thought it was funny. They said, \u0027Make her stop,\u0027 and Great Nananne said, \u0027What makes you think I can do that?\u0027 as if I was some wild creature that she couldn\u0027t control.\"\n Again there had come that little sigh.\n \"Great Nananne\u0027s really dying,\" she said looking up at me, her green eyes never wavering. \"She says there is no one now, and I have to keep these things¡ªher books, her clippings. See, look here, at these clippings. The old newspaper is so brittle it\u0027s falling apart. Mr. Lightner\u0027s going to help me save these things.\" She glanced at Aaron. \"Why are you so afraid for me, Mr. Talbot? Aren\u0027t you strong enough? You don\u0027t think it\u0027s so bad to be colored, do you? You\u0027re not from here, you\u0027re from away.\"\n Afraid. Was I really feeling it so strongly? She\u0027d spoken with authority, and I\u0027d searched for the truth in it, but come quick to my own defense and perhaps to hers as well.\n \"Read my heart, child,\" I said. \"I think nothing of the sort about being colored, though maybe there were times when I\u0027ve thought that it might have been bad luck in a particular case.\" She\u0027d raised her eyebrows slightly, thoughtfully. I\u0027d continued, anxious, perhaps, but not afraid. \"I\u0027m sad because you say you have no one, and I\u0027m glad because I know that you have us.\"\n \"That\u0027s what Great Nananne says, more or less,\" she answered. And for the first time, her long full mouth made a true smile.\n My mind had drifted, remembering the incomparable dark\u001eskinned women I\u0027d seen in India, though she was a marvel of different tones, the rich mahogany hair and the pale eyes so visible and so meaningful. I\u0027d thought again that to many she must have looked exotic, this barefoot girl in the flowered shift.\n Then had come a moment of pure feeling, which had made its indelible and irrational impression. I\u0027d perused the many faces laid out upon the table, and it had seemed they were all gazing at me. It was a marked impression. The little pictures had been alive all along.\n It must be the firelight and the oil lamps, I\u0027d thought dreamily, but I\u0027d been unable to shake the feeling; the little people had been laid out to look at Aaron and to look at me. Even their placement seemed deliberate and sly, or wondrously meaningful, I\u0027d conjectured, as I went smoothly from suspicion to a lulled and tranquil feeling that I was in an audience with a host of the dead.\n \"They do seem to be looking,\" Aaron had murmured, I remember, though I\u0027m sure I hadn\u0027t spoken. The clock had stopped ticking and I\u0027d turned to look at it, uncertain where it was. On the mantle, yes, and its hands had been frozen, and the window\u001epanes had given that muffled rattle that they do when the wind nudges them, and the house had wrapped me securely in its own atmosphere of warmth and secrets, of safety and sanctity, of dreaminess and communal might.\n It seemed a long interval had transpired in which none of us had spoken, and Merrick had stared at me, and then at Aaron, her hands idle, her face glistening in the light.\n I\u0027d awakened sharply to realize nothing had changed in the room. Had I fallen asleep? Unforgivable rudeness. Aaron had been beside me as before. And the pictures had become once more inert and sorrowful, ceremonial testimony to mortality as surely as if she\u0027d laid out a skull for my perusal from a graveyard fallen to ruin. But the uneasiness I\u0027d experienced then stayed with me long after we\u0027d all gone up to our respective rooms.\n Now¡ªafter twenty years and many other strange moments¡ªshe sat across from me at this cafe table in the Rue St. Anne, a beauty gazing at a vampire, and we talked over the flickering candle, and the light was too much like the light of that long ago evening at Oak Haven, though tonight the late spring evening was only moist, not wet with a coming storm.\n She sipped the rum, rolling it around a bit before she swallowed it. But she didn\u0027t fool me. She\u0027d soon start drinking it fast again. She set the glass aside and let her fingers spread wide apart on the soiled marble. Rings. Those were Great Nananne\u0027s many rings, beautiful gold filigree with various wondrous stones. She\u0027d worn them even in the jungles, when I\u0027d thought it so unwise. She\u0027d never been prone to fear of any sort.\n I thought of her in those hot tropical nights. I thought of her during those steamy hours under the high canopy of green. I thought of the trek through the darkness of the ancient temple. I thought of her climbing ahead of me, in the steam and roar of the waterfall up the gentle slope.\n I\u0027d been far too old for it, our great and secret adventure. I thought of precious objects made of jade as green as her eyes.\n Her voice brought me out of my selfish reverie:\n \"Why are you asking me to do this magic?\" She put the question to me again. \"I sit here and I took at you, David, and with every passing second, I become more aware of what you are and what\u0027s happened to you. I put all kinds of pieces together from your open mind¡ªand your mind\u0027s as open as it ever was, David, you know that, don\u0027t you?\"\n How resolute was her voice. Yes, the French was utterly gone. Ten years ago it had been gone. But now there was a clipped quality to her words, no matter how soft and low they came.\n Her large eyes widened easily with her expressive verbal rhythms.\n \"You couldn\u0027t even be quiet of mind on the porch the other night,\" she scolded. \"You woke me. I heard you, just as if you\u0027d been tapping on the panes. You said, \u0027Merrick, can you do it? Can you bring up the dead for Louis de Pointe du Lac?\u0027 And do you know what I heard underneath it? I heard \u0027Merrick, I need you. I need to talk to you. Merrick, my destiny is shattered. Merrick, I reach for understanding. Don\u0027t turn me aside.\u0027\"\n I felt an acute pain in my heart.\n \"It\u0027s true what you\u0027re saying,\" I confessed.\n She drank another big swallow of the rum, and the heat danced in her cheeks.\n \"But you want this thing for Louis,\" she said. \"You want it enough to overcome your own scruples and come to my window. Why? You, I understand. Of him, I know other people\u0027s stories and just the little I\u0027ve seen with my own eyes. He\u0027s a dashing young man, that one, isn\u0027t he?\"\n I was too confused to answer, too confused to will courtesy to build a temporary bridge of polite lies.\n \"David, give me your hand, please,\" she asked suddenly. \"I have to touch you. I have to feel this strange skin.\"\n \"Oh, darling, if only you could forego that,\" I murmured.\n Her large golden earrings moved against the nest of her black hair and the long line of her beautiful neck. All the promise of the child had been fulfilled in her. Men admired her enormously. I had known that a long time ago.\n She reached out to me gracefully. Boldly, hopelessly, I gave her my hand.\n I wanted the contact. I wanted the intimacy. I was powerfully stimulated. And treasuring the sensation, I let her fingers linger as she looked into my palm.\n \"Why read this palm, Merrick?\" I asked. \"What can it tell you? This body belonged to another man. Do you want to read the map of his broken fate? Can you see there that he was murdered and the body stolen? Can you see there my own selfish invasion of a body that ought to have died?\"\n \"I know the story, David,\" she answered. \"I found it all in Aaron\u0027s papers. Body switching. Highly theoretical as regards the official position of the Order. But you were a grand success.\"\n Her fingers sent the thrills up my spine and through the roots of my hair.\n \"After Aaron\u0027s death, I read the whole thing,\" she said, as she moved her fingertips across the pattern of deeply etched lines. She recited it:\n \"\u0027David Talbot is no longer in his body. During an ill\u001efated experiment with astral projection he was ousted from his own form by a practiced Body Thief and forced to claim the youthful trophy of his opponent, a body stolen from a shattered soul which has, as far as we can know, moved on.\u0027\"\n I winced at the old familiar Talamasca style.\n \"I wasn\u0027t meant to find those papers,\" she continued, her eyes still fixed on my palm. \"But Aaron died here, in New Orleans, and I had them in my hands before anyone else. They\u0027re still in my possession, David; they have never been filed with the Elders and maybe they never will be filed. I don\u0027t know.\"\n I was amazed at her audacity, to have held back such secrets from the Order to which she still devoted her life. When had I ever had such independence, except perhaps at the very end?\n Her eyes moved quickly back and forth as she examined my palm. She pressed her thumb softly against my flesh. The chills were unbearably enticing. I wanted to take her in my arms, not feed from her, no, not harm her, only kiss her, only sink my fangs a very little, only taste her blood and her secrets, but this was dreadful and I wouldn\u0027t let it go on.\n I withdrew my outstretched hand.\n \"What did you see, Merrick?\" I asked quickly, swallowing the hunger of body and mind.\n \"Disasters large and small, my friend, a life line that goes on as long as any, stars of strength, and a brood of offspring.\"\n \"Stop it, I don\u0027t accept it. The hand\u0027s not mine.\"\n \"You have no other body now,\" she countered. \"Don\u0027t you think the body will conform to its new soul? The palm of a hand changes over time. But I don\u0027t want to make you angry. I didn\u0027t come here to study you. I didn\u0027t come here to stare in cold fascination at a vampire. I\u0027ve glimpsed vampires. I\u0027ve even been close to them, in these very streets. I came because you asked me and because I wanted ... to be with you.\"\n I nodded, overcome and unable for the moment to speak. With quick gestures I pleaded for her silence.\n She waited.\n Then at last:\n \"Did you ask permission of the Elders for this meeting?\"\n She laughed but it wasn\u0027t cruel. \"Of course I did not.\"\n \"Then know this,\" I said. \"It started the same way with me and the Vampire Lestat. I didn\u0027t tell the Elders. I didn\u0027t let them know how often I saw him, that I brought him into my house, that I conversed with him, traveled with him, taught him how to reclaim his preternatural body when the Body Thief tricked him out of it.\"\n She tried to interrupt me but I would have none of it.\n \"And do you realize what\u0027s happened to me?\" I demanded. \"I thought I was too clever for Lestat ever to seduce me. I thought I was too wise in old age for the seduction of immortality. I thought I was morally superior, Merrick, and now you see what I am.\"\n \"Aren\u0027t you going to swear to me that you\u0027ll never hurt me?\" she asked, her face beautifully flushed. \"Aren\u0027t you going to assure me that Louis de Pointe du Lac would never bring me harm?\"\n \"Of course I am. But there\u0027s a bit of decency left in me, and that decency compels me to remind you that I\u0027m a creature of supernatural appetite.\"\n Again she tried to interject, but I wouldn\u0027t allow it.\n \"My very presence, with all its signals of power, can erode your own tolerance for living, Merrick; it can eat away your faith in a moral order, it can hurt your willingness to die an ordinary death.\"\n \"Ah, David,\" she said, chiding me for my official tone. \"Speak plainly. What\u0027s in your heart? \" She sat up straight in the chair, her eyes looking me up and down. \"You look boyish and wise in this young body. Your skin\u0027s darkened like mine! Even your features have the stamp of Asia. But you\u0027re more David than you ever were!\"\n I said nothing.\n I watched through dazed eyes as she drank more of the rum. The sky darkened behind her, but bright, warm electric lights filled up the outside night. Only the caf¨¦ itself was veiled in dreary shadow, what with its few dusty bulbs behind the bar.\n Her cool confidence chilled me. It chilled me that she had so fearlessly touched me, that nothing in my vampire nature repelled her, but then I could well remember how Lestat in all his subdued glory had attracted me. Was she attracted? Had the fatal fascination begun?\n She kept her thoughts half concealed as she always had.\n I thought of Louis. I thought of his request. He wanted desperately for her to work her magic. But she was right. I needed her. I needed her witness and her understanding.\n When I spoke, my words were full of heartbreak and wonder, even to myself.\n \"It\u0027s been magnificent,\" I said. \"And unendurable. I am most truly out of life and can\u0027t escape from it. I have no one to whom I can give what I learn.\"\n She didn\u0027t argue with me or question me. Her eyes seemed suddenly to be full of sympathy, her mask of composure to be gone. I\u0027d seen such sharp changes in her many times. She concealed her emotions except for such silent and eloquent moments.\n \"Do you think,\" she asked, \"that if you hadn\u0027t taken up life in the young body, that Lestat would have forced you as he did? If you\u0027d still been old¡ªour David, our blessed David, aged seventy\u001efour, wasn\u0027t it?¡ªdo you think if you\u0027d still been our honorable Superior General that Lestat would have brought you over?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" I said shortly, but not without feeling. \"I\u0027ve often asked myself the same question. I honestly don\u0027t know. These vampires ... ah, I mean, we ... we vampires, we love beauty, we feed on it. Our definition of beauty expands enormously, you can\u0027t quite imagine how much. I don\u0027t care how loving your soul, you can\u0027t know how much we find beautiful that mortals don\u0027t find beautiful, but we do propagate by beauty, and this body has beauty which I\u0027ve used to evil advantage countless times.\"\n She lifted her glass in a small salute. She drank deeply.\n \"If you\u0027d come up to me with no preamble,\" she said, \"whispering in a crowd as you touched me¡ªI would have known you, known who you were.\" A shadow fell over her face for a moment, and then her expression became serene. \"I love you, old friend,\" she said.\n \"You think so, my darling?\" I asked. \"I have done many things to feed this body; not so very lovely to think about that at all.\"\n She finished the glass, set it down, and, before I could do it for her, she reached for the bottle again.\n \"Do you want Aaron\u0027s papers?\" she asked.\n I was completely taken aback.\n \"You mean you\u0027re willing to give them to me?\"\n \"David, I\u0027m loyal to the Talamasca. What would I be if it weren\u0027t for the Order?\" She hesitated, then: \"But I\u0027m also deeply loyal to you.\" For a few seconds she was musing. \"You were the Order for me, David. Can you imagine what I felt when they told me you were dead?\"\n I sighed. What could I say in answer?\n \"Did Aaron tell you how we grieved for you, all those of us who weren\u0027t entrusted with a speck of the truth?\"\n \"From my soul, I\u0027m sorry, Merrick. We felt we kept a dangerous secret. What more can I say?\"\n \"You died here in the States, in Miami Beach, that was the story. And they\u0027d flown the remains back to England before they even called to tell me you were gone. You know what I did, David? I made them hold the casket for me. It was sealed shut when I got to London but I made them open it. I made them do it. I screamed and carried on until they gave in to me. Then I sent them out of the room and I stayed alone with that body, David, that body all powdered and prettied up and nestled in its satin. I stayed there for an hour perhaps. They were knocking on the door. Then finally I told them to proceed.\"\n There was no anger in her face, only a faint wondering expression.\n \"I couldn\u0027t let Aaron tell you,\" I said, \"not just then, not when I didn\u0027t know whether I\u0027d survive in the new body, not when I didn\u0027t understand what life held for me. I couldn\u0027t. And then, then it was too late.\"\n She raised her eyebrows and made a little doubting gesture with her head. She sipped the rum.\n \"I understand,\" she said.\n \"Thank God,\" I answered. \"In time, Aaron would have told you about the body switching,\" I insisted. \"I know he would have. The story of my death was never meant for you.\"\n She nodded, holding back the first response that came to her tongue.\n \"I think you have to file those papers of Aaron\u0027s,\" I said. \"You have to file them directly with the Elders and no one else. Forget the Superior General of the moment.\"\n \"Stop it, David,\" she responded. \"You know it is much easier to argue with you now that you are in the body of a very young man.\"\n \"You never had difficulty arguing with me, Merrick,\" I retorted. \"Don\u0027t you think Aaron would have filed the papers, had he lived?\"\n \"Maybe,\" she said, \"and maybe not. Maybe Aaron would have wanted more that you be left to your destiny. Maybe Aaron wanted more that whatever you had become, you\u0027d be left alone.\"\n I wasn\u0027t sure what she was saying. The Talamasca was so passive, so reticent, so downright unwilling in interfere in anyone\u0027s destiny, I couldn\u0027t figure what she meant.\n She shrugged, took another sip of ram, and rolled the rim of the glass against her lower lip.\n \"Maybe it doesn\u0027t matter,\" she said. \"I only know that Aaron never filed the pages himself.\" She went on speaking:\n \"The night after he was killed I went down to his house on Esplanade Avenue. You know he married a white Mayfair, not a witch by the way, but a resilient and generous woman¡ªBeatrice Mayfair is her name, she\u0027s still living¡ªand at her invitation I took the papers marked \u0027Talamasca.\u0027 She didn\u0027t even know what they contained.\n \"She told me Aaron had once given her my name. If anything happened, she was to call me, and so she\u0027d done her duty. Besides, she couldn\u0027t read the documents. They were all in Latin, you know, Talamasca old style.\n \"There were several files, and my name and number were written on the front of each, in Aaron\u0027s hand. One file was entirely devoted to you, though only the initial, D, was used throughout. The papers on you, I translated into English. No one\u0027s ever seen them. No one,\" she said with emphasis. \"But I know them almost word for word.\"\n It seemed a comfort suddenly to hear her speaking of these things, these secret Talamasca things, which had once been our stock in trade. Yes, a comfort, as if the warm presence of Aaron were actually with us again.\n She stopped for another sip of the rum.\n \"I feel you ought to know these things,\" she said. \"We never kept anything from each other, you and I. Not that I knew of, but then of course my work was in the study of magic, and I did roam far and wide.\"\n \"How much did Aaron know?\" I asked. I thought my eyes were tearing. I was humiliated. But I wanted her to go on. \"I never saw Aaron after the vampiric metamorphosis,\" I confessed dully. \"I couldn\u0027t bring myself to do it. Can you guess why?\" I felt a sharp increase in mental pain and confusion. My grief for Aaron would never go away, and I\u0027d endured it for years without a word to either of my vampire companions, Louis or Lestat.\n \"No,\" she said. \"I can\u0027t guess why. I can tell you. . . , \" and here she hesitated politely so that I might stop her, but I did not. \"I can tell you that he was disappointed and forgiving to the end.\"\n I bowed my head. I pressed my forehead into my cold hand.\n \"By his own account he prayed each day that you would come to him,\" she explained slowly, \"that he\u0027d have a chance for one last conversation with you¡ªabout all you\u0027d endured together and what had finally occurred to drive you apart.\"\n I must have winced. I deserved the misery, however, deserved it more than she could know. It had been indecent not to have written to him! Lord God, even Jesse, when she\u0027d vanished out of the Talamasca, had written to me!\n Merrick went on speaking. If she read my mind at all, she gave no clue.\n \"Of course Aaron wrote all about your Faustian Body Switching, as he called it. He described you in the young body and made many references to some investigation of the body, something you\u0027d engaged in together, asserting that the soul had certainly gone on. You experimented, didn\u0027t you, you and Aaron, with trying to reach the rightful soul, even at the risk of your own death?\"\n I nodded, unable to speak, feeling desperate and ashamed.\n \"As for the wretched Body Thief, the little devil Raglan James who\u0027d started the whole supernatural spectacle, Aaron was convinced his soul was gone into eternity, as he put it, quite utterly beyond reach.\"\n \"That\u0027s true,\" I concurred. \"The file on him is closed, I\u0027m quite convinced of it, whether it\u0027s incomplete or not.\"\n A darkness crept into her sad respectful expression. Some raw feeling had come to the surface, and for the moment she broke off.\n \"What else did Aaron write?\" I asked her.\n \"He referred to the Talamasca having unofficially helped \u0027the new David\u0027 reclaim his substantial investments and property,\" she answered. \"He felt strongly that no File on David\u0027s Second Youth must ever be created or committed to the archives in London or in Rome.\"\n \"Why didn\u0027t he want the switch to be studied?\" I asked. \"We had done everything we could for the other souls.\"\n \"Aaron wrote that the whole question of switching was too dangerous, too enticing; he was afraid the material would fall into the wrong hands.\"\n \"Of course,\" I answered, \"though in the old days we never had such doubts.\"\n \"But the file was unfinished,\" she continued. \"Aaron felt certain he would see you again. He thought that at times he could sense your presence in New Orleans. He found himself searching crowds for your new face.\"\n \"God forgive me,\" I whispered. I almost turned away. I bowed my head and shielded my eyes for a long moment. My old friend, my beloved old friend. How could I have abandoned him so coldly? Why does shame and self\u001eloathing become cruelty to the innocent? How is that so often the case?\n \"Go on, please,\" I said, recovering. \"I want you to tell me all these things.\"\n \"Do you want to read them for yourself?\"\n \"Soon,\" I answered.\n She continued, her tongue somewhat loosened by the ram, and her voice more melodic, with just a little of the old New Orleans French accent coming back.\n \"Aaron had seen the Vampire Lestat in your company once. He described the experience as harrowing, a word that Aaron rather loved but seldom used. He said it was the night he came to identify the old body of David Talbot and to see that it was properly buried. There you were, the young man, and the vampire stood beside you. He\u0027d known you were on intimate terms with one another, you and this creature. He had been afraid for you as much then as ever in his life.\"\n \"What more?\" I asked.\n \"Later on,\" she said, her voice low and respectful, \"when you disappeared quite completely, Aaron was certain that you\u0027d been forcibly changed by Lestat. Nothing short of that could explain your sudden break in communication, coupled with the clear intelligence from your banks and agents that you were most definitely still alive. Aaron missed you desperately. His life had been consumed with the problems of the white Mayfairs, the Mayfair Witches. He needed your advice. He wrote many times in many ways that he was certain you never asked for the vampiric blood.\"\n For a long time I couldn\u0027t speak to answer her. I didn\u0027t weep because I don\u0027t. I looked off, eyes roaming the empty cafe until they saw nothing, except perhaps the blur of the tourists as they crowded the street outside on their way to Jackson Square. I knew perfectly well how to be alone in the midst of a terrible moment, no matter where it actually occurred. I was alone now.\n Then I let my mind drift back to him, my friend Aaron, my colleague, my companion. I seized on memories far larger than any one incident. I envisioned him, his genial face and clever gray eyes. I saw him strolling along the brightly lit Ocean Avenue in Miami Beach, looking wonderfully out of place and richly like a splendid ornament to the bizarre scenery, in his three\u001epiece cotton pinstripe suit.\n I let the pain have me. Murdered for the secrets of the Mayfair Witches. Murdered by renegade beings in the Talamasca. Of course he had not given up to the Order his report on me. It had been a time of troubles, hadn\u0027t it, and he had ultimately been betrayed by the Order; and so my story would, within the fabled archives, remain forever incomplete.\n \"Was there more?\" I asked Merrick finally.\n \"No. Only the same song with different rhythms. That was all.\" She took another drink. \"He was terribly happy at the end, you know.\"\n \"Tell me.\"\n \"Beatrice Mayfair, he loved her. He never expected to be happily married, but it had happened. She was a beautiful highly social woman, rather like three or four people rolled into one. He told me he\u0027d never had so much fun in his life as he had with Beatrice, and she wasn\u0027t a witch, of course.\"\n \"I\u0027m so very glad to hear it,\" I said, my voice tremulous. \"So Aaron became one of them, you might say.\"\n \"Yes,\" she answered. \"In all respects.\"\n She shrugged, the empty glass in her hand. Why she waited to take more, I wasn\u0027t certain; perhaps to impress me that she wasn\u0027t the famous drunk that I knew her to be.\n \"But I don\u0027t know anything about those white Mayfairs,\" she said finally. \"Aaron always kept me away from them. My work for the last few years had been in Voodoo. I\u0027ve made trips to Haiti. I\u0027ve written pages. You know I\u0027m one of the few members of the Order who is studying her own psychic power, with a license from the Elders to use the damnable magic, as the Superior General calls it now.\"\n I hadn\u0027t known this. It had never even occurred to me that she\u0027d returned to Voodoo, which had cast its generous shadow over her youth. We had never in my time encouraged a witch to practice magic. Only the vampire in me could tolerate such a thought.\n \"Look,\" she said, \"it doesn\u0027t matter that you didn\u0027t write to Aaron.\"\n \"Oh, doesn\u0027t it?\" I asked in a sharp whisper. But then I explained: \"I simply couldn\u0027t write to him. I simply couldn\u0027t speak on the phone. As for seeing him, or letting him see me, it was out of the question!\" I whispered.\n \"And it took five years,\" she said, \"for you to finally come to me.\"\n \"Oh, right to the point!\" I responded. \"Five years or more to do it. And had Aaron lived on, who knows what I would have done? But the crucial factor was this: Aaron was old, Merrick. He was old and he might have asked me for the blood. When you\u0027re old and you\u0027re afraid, when you\u0027re weary and you\u0027re sick, when you\u0027ve begun to suspect that your life means nothing ... Well, that\u0027s when you dream of vampiric bargains. That\u0027s when you think that somehow the vampiric curse can\u0027t be so very dreadful, no, not in exchange for immortality; that\u0027s when you think that if only you had the chance, you could become some premier witness to the evolution of the world around you. You cloak your selfish desires in the grandiose.\"\n \"And you think I never will think such thoughts?\" She raised her eyebrows, her green eyes large and full of light.\n \"You\u0027re young and beautiful,\" I said, \"you were born and bred on courage. Your organs and limbs are as sound as your mind. You\u0027ve never been defeated, not by anything, and you\u0027re in perfect health.\"\n I was trembling all over. I couldn\u0027t endure much more of this. I\u0027d dreamt of solace and intimacy, and this was intimacy, but at a terrible price.\n How much easier it was to spend hours in the company of Lestat, who never spoke anymore, who lay still in a half sleep, listening to music, having been waked by it and now lulled by it, a vampire who craved nothing more?\n How much easier to roam the city in the company of Louis, my weaker and ever charming companion, seeking out victims and perfecting the \"little drink\" so that we left our prey dazzled and unharmed? How much easier to remain within the sanctuary of the French Quarter town house, reading with a vampire\u0027s speed all the volumes of history or art history over which I\u0027d labored so slowly when a mortal man?\n Merrick merely looked at me with obvious sympathy, and then she reached out for my hand.\n I avoided her touch because I wanted it so much.\n \"Don\u0027t back away from me, old friend,\" she said.\n I was too confused to speak.\n \"What you want me to know,\" she said, \"is that neither you nor Louis de Pointe du Lac will ever give me the blood, not even if I beg you for it; that it can\u0027t be part of any bargain between us.\"\n \"Bargain. It would be no bargain!\" I whispered.\n She took another drink. \"And you\u0027ll never take my life,\" she said. \"That\u0027s what makes it a bargain, I suppose. You won\u0027t ever hurt me as you might some other mortal woman who crossed your path.\"\n The question of those who crossed my path was too troubling to me for any good response. For the first time since we had come together, I truly tried to divine her thoughts, but I could read nothing. As a vampire, I had great power in this respect. Louis had almost none. Lestat was the master.\n I watched her drink the rum mote slowly, and I saw her eyes become glazed with the pleasure of it, and her face soften wonderfully as the rum worked in her veins. Her cheeks were reddening slightly. Her complexion looked perfect.\n Chills ran through me again, through my arms and shoulders and up the side of my face.\n I had fed before I\u0027d come here, or else the fragrance of her blood would have clouded my judgment even more than the excitement of this intimacy clouded it. I had not taken life, no, it was too simple to feed without doing it, attractive though it was. I prided myself on that. I felt clean for her, though it was becoming increasingly simple for me to \"seek the evildoer,\" as Lestat had once instructed\u001eto find some unwholesome and cruel individual whom I could fancy to be worse than myself.\n \"Oh, I wept so many tears for you,\" she said, her voice more heated.\n \"And then for Aaron, for all of your generation, leaving us suddenly and too soon, one after another.\" She suddenly hunched her shoulders and leant forward as though she were in pain.\n \"The young ones in the Talamasca don\u0027t know me, David,\" she said quickly. \"And you don\u0027t come to me just because Louis de Pointe du Lac asked you to do it. You don\u0027t come to me just to raise the child vampire\u0027s ghost. You want me, David, you want my witness, David, and I want yours.\"\n \"You\u0027re right on all counts, Merrick,\" I confessed. The words spilled from me. \"I love you, Merrick, I love you the way I loved Aaron, and the way I love Louis and Lestat.\"\n I saw the flash of acute suffering in her face, as though it were the flash of a light from within.\n \"Don\u0027t be sorry you came to me,\" she said as I reached out to take hold of her. She caught my hands and held them in her own, her clasp moist and warm. \"Don\u0027t be sorry. I\u0027m not. Only promise me you won\u0027t lose heart and leave me without explanation. Don\u0027t break away from me hurriedly. Don\u0027t give in to some skewed sense of honor. If you did, my sanity might actually break.\"\n \"You mean I mustn\u0027t leave you the way I left Aaron,\" I said thickly. \"No, I promise you, my precious darling. I won\u0027t do it. It\u0027s already much too late for such a thing.\"\n \"Then, I love you,\" she announced in a whisper. \"I love you as I always have. No, more than that, I think, because you bring this miracle with you. But what of the spirit that lives within?\"\n \"What spirit?\" I asked her.\n But she\u0027d already gone deep into her own thoughts. She drank another swallow directly from the bottle.\n I couldn\u0027t bear the table between us. I stood slowly, lifting her hands until she stood beside me, and then I took her warmly into my arms. I kissed her lips, her old familiar perfume rising to my nostrils, and I kissed her forehead, and then I held her head tightly against my beating heart.\n \"You hear it?\" I whispered. \"What spirit could there be except my spirit? My body is changed, and no more.\"\n I was overcome with desire for her, the desire to know her utterly through the blood. Her perfume maddened me. But there wasn\u0027t the slightest chance that I\u0027d give in to my desire.\n But I kissed her again. And it wasn\u0027t chaste.\n For several long moments we remained locked together, and I think I covered her hair with small sacred kisses, her perfume crucify\u001fing me with memories. I wanted to endow her with protection against all things as sordid as myself.\n She backed away from me, finally, as if she had to do it, and she was a little unsteady on her feet.\n \"Never in all those years did you ever touch me in this way,\" she said under her breath. \"And I wanted you so badly. Do you remem\u001fber? Do you remember that night in the jungle when I finally got my wish? Do you remember how drunk you were, and how splendid? Oh, it was over way too soon.\"\n \"I was a fool, but all such things are past remembering,\" I whis\u001fpered. \"Now, don\u0027t let\u0027s spoil what\u0027s happened. Come, I\u0027ve gotten a hotel room for you, and I\u0027ll see that you\u0027re safely there for the night.\"\n \"Why on earth? Oak Haven is exactly where it\u0027s always been,\" she said dreamily. She shook her head to clear her vision. \"I\u0027m going home.\"\n \"No, you\u0027re not. You drank even more rum than I predicted. Look, you drank over half the bottle. And I know you\u0027ll drink the rest of the bottle as soon as you get in the car.\"\n She laughed a small scornful laugh. \"Still the consummate gentle\u001fman,\" she said. \"And the Superior General. You can escort me to my old house here in town. You know perfectly well where it is.\"\n \"That neighborhood, even at this hour? Absolutely not. Besides, your friendly old caretaker there is an incompetent idiot. My precious darling, I\u0027m taking you to the hotel.\"\n \"Foolish,\" she said as she half stumbled. \"I don\u0027t need a caretaker. I\u0027d rather go to my house. You\u0027re being a nuisance. You always were.\"\n \"You\u0027re a witch and a drunk,\" I said politely. \"Here, we\u0027ll just cap this bottle.\" I did it. \"And we\u0027ll put it in this canvas purse of yours and I\u0027ll walk with you to the hotel. Take my arm.\"\n For a small second she looked playful and defiant, but then she made a languid shrug, smiling faintly, and gave up her purse to my insistence and wrapped her arm around mine. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/merrick-the-vampire-chronicles-7/page-3.html","bookId":2215,"book":{"id":2215,"title":"Merrick (The Vampire Chronicles #7)","description":"Storyline: \n Merrick (The Vampire Chronicles #7) \n Just when you thought it was safe for a bloodsucker to go out in the dark in New Orleans, along comes Merrick Mayfair, a sultry, hard-drinking octoroon beauty whose voodoo can turn the toughest vampire into a marionette dancing to her merry, scary tune.
