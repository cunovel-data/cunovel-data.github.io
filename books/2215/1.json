I don\u0027t really know all the secrets of the Order. I do know however that I served it most of my mortal life.\\n\\n It was in the Talamasca Motherhouse in England that the Vampire Lestat first made himself known to me. He came into my study one winter night and caught me quite unawares.\\n\\n I learnt very quickly that it was one thing to read and write about the supernatural and quite another to see it with your own eyes.\\n\\n But that was a long time ago.\\n\\n I\u0027m in another physical body now.\\n\\n And that physical body has been transformed by Lestat\u0027s powerful vampiric blood.\\n\\n I\u0027m among the most dangerous of the vampires, and one of the most trusted. Even the wary vampire Armand revealed to me the story of his life. Perhaps you\u0027ve read the biography of Armand which I released into the world.\\n\\n When that story ended, Lestat had wakened from a long sleep in New Orleans to listen to some very beautiful and seductive music.\\n\\n It was music that lulled him back again into unbroken silence as he retreated once more to a convent building to lie upon a dusty marble floor.\\n\\n There were many vampires then in the city of New Orleans¡ªvagabonds, rogues, foolish young ones who had come to catch a glimpse of Lestat in his seeming helplessness. They menaced the mortal population. They annoyed the elders among us who wanted invisibility and the right to hunt in peace.\\n\\n All those invaders are gone now.\\n\\n Some were destroyed, others merely frightened. And the elders who had come to offer some solace to the sleeping Lestat have gone their separate ways.\\n\\n As this story begins, only three of us remain in New Orleans. And we three are the sleeping Lestat, and his two faithful fledglings¡ªLouis de Pointe du Lac, and I, David Talbot, the author of this tale. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/merrick-the-vampire-chronicles-7/page-1.html","bookId":2215,"book":{"id":2215,"title":"Merrick (The Vampire Chronicles #7)","description":"Storyline: Merrick (The Vampire Chronicles #7) \\n Just when you thought it was safe for a bloodsucker to go out in the dark in New Orleans, along comes Merrick Mayfair, a sultry, hard-drinking octoroon beauty whose voodoo can turn the toughest vampire into a marionette dancing to her merry, scary tune. In Merrick, Anne Rice brings back three of her most wildly popular characters--the vampires Lestat and Louis and the dead vampire child Claudia--and introduces them to the world of her Mayfair Witches book series. It is Louis who brings about the collision of the fang and voodoo universes. Louis made Claudia a vampire in Rice\u0027s classic Interview with the Vampire, in which she was destroyed, and now he\u0027s obsessed with raising her ghost to make amends and seek guidance from the beyond.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/merrick-the-vampire-chronicles-7.jpg","author":"Anne Rice","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/merrick-the-vampire-chronicles-7.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:27 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:20:57 PM"}}
