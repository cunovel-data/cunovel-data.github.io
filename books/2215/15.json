{"id":103182,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"14 IN THE JEEP, we managed an hour before the road gave out. Then, hefting our machetes, we proceeded to follow the trail on foot. There was very little conversation between us, all of our energy being given over to the difficult and steady assent. But again that sense of bliss descended upon me, and the sight of Merrick\u0027s forceful slim body up ahead of me was a constant guilty delight. The jungle now seemed impenetrable, regardless of the altitude, and again there came the clouds with their wondrous sweetness and damp. I had my eye out all the time for ruins of any sort, and indeed we saw them, on both sides of us, but whether they were temples or pyra\u001fmids or whatever, I was not meant to know. Merrick dismissed them out of hand, and insisted that we press doggedly on. The heat ate through my clothing. My right arm ached from the weight of the machete. The insects became an unendurable nuisance, but I would not have been in any other place just then for anything in the world. Quite suddenly Merrick stopped, and motioned for me to come to her side. We had come upon a clearing of sorts, or the remains of one, I should say, and I saw decayed plaster hovels where there had once been houses, and one or two shelters which still maintained their old thatched roofs. \"The little village is gone,\" Merrick said as she surveyed the disaster. I remembered Matthew Kemp\u0027s mention of Village One and Village Two on his map and in his letters of years ago. She stood for a long moment staring into the remnants of the place and then she spoke in a secretive voice. \"Do you feel anything?\" I had not felt anything until she asked me, but no sooner did I hear the question than I was aware of something spiritually turbulent in the air. I resolved to apply all my senses to it. It was quite strong. I cannot say I felt personalities or an attitude. I felt a commotion. For one moment I felt menace, and then nothing at all. \"What do you make of it?\" I asked her. Her very stillness made me uneasy. \"It\u0027s not the spirits of this village,\" she answered. \"And I\u0027ll bet you anything that whatever we\u0027re feeling is precisely what caused the villagers to move on.\" She started off again, and I had no choice but to follow her. I was almost as obsessed as she. Once we had circled the entangled village ruin, the trail appeared again. However, the jungle soon became denser; we had to hack our way all the more fiercely, and at times I felt a dreadful pain in my chest. Quite suddenly, as if it had appeared by magic, I saw the huge bulk of a pale stone pyramid looming before us, its steps covered by scrub growth and dense vine. Someone at some time had cleared it, and much of its strange carving was visible, as well as its flight of steep steps. No, it wasn\u0027t Maya, at least not insofar as I could see. \"Ah, let me savor this,\" I said to Merrick. She didn\u0027t answer me. She seemed to be listening for an important sound. I too listened and there came again that awareness that we were not alone. Something moved in the atmosphere, something pushed against us, something sought with great determination to move against gravity and affect my body as I stood there, machete in hand. Merrick suddenly veered to the left, and began hacking her way around the side of the pyramid and onward in the same direction that we\u0027d taken before. There was no trail now. There was nothing but the jungle, and I soon realized that another pyramid loomed to our left, and that it was much higher than the building to our right. We were in a small alley-way before the two immense monuments, and we had to make our way through cumbersome rubble, as someone had done digging here at some time before. \"Thieves,\" she said, as if reading my thoughts. \"They\u0027ve plundered the pyramids many times.\" That was hardly uncommon with regard to Maya ruins. So why should it not happen to these strange alien buildings as well? \"Ah, but look,\" I said, \"at what they\u0027ve left behind. I want to climb one of these. Let\u0027s tackle the smaller one. I want to see if I can make it to the platform on top.\" She knew as well as I did that that is where a thatched\u001eroof temple might have stood in ancient times. As for the age of these monuments, I had no indication. They might have been built before the Birth of Christ or a thousand years after. Whatever, they seemed marvelous to me and they maddened my already boyish sense of adventure. I wanted to get out my camera. Meantime, the spiritual tumult continued. It was wondrously intriguing. It was as if the air were whipped by the spirits. The sense of menace was strong. \"Good Lord, Merrick, how they\u0027re trying to stop us,\" I whispered. The jungle gave forth its chorus of cries, as if answering me. Something moved in the brush. But Merrick, after stopping for only a few moments, pressed on. \"I have to find the cave,\" she said in a dull flat voice. \"They didn\u0027t stop us last time and they\u0027re not going to stop you and me now.\" On she went, the jungle closing all too readily behind her. \"Yes,\" I cried out. \"It\u0027s not one soul, it\u0027s many. They don\u0027t want us near these pyramids.\" \"It\u0027s not the pyramids,\" she insisted, chopping at the vines and pushing through the undergrowth. \"It\u0027s the cave, they know we are going to the cave.\" I did my best to keep up with her, and to aid her, but she was definitely the one clearing our path. We had gone some yards when it seemed the jungle grew impossibly thick and that the light was suddenly altered, and I realized we had come to the blackened doorway of an immense edifice, which spread its sloping walls to our right and our left. It was a temple, surely, and I could see the impressive carvings on either side of the entrance, and also above as the wall rose to a great apron of stone with intricate carv\u001fings visible in the scarce high rays of the desperate sun. \"Lord, Merrick, wait,\" I called out. \"Let me photograph this.\" I struggled to reach my small camera, but I would have to remove my backpack and my arms were simply too tired. The airy turbulence grew extremely intense. I felt something simi\u001flar to the light tap of fingers against my eyelids and my cheeks. It was altogether different from the constant barrage of the insect world. I felt something touch the back of my hands, and it seemed that I almost lost my grip on the machete, but I quickly recovered. As for Merrick, she stood staring into the darkness of the hallway or passage in front of her. \"My God,\" she whispered. \"They\u0027re much stronger than they were before. They don\u0027t want us to go inside.\" \"And why would we do that?\" I asked quickly. \"We\u0027re searching for a cave.\" \"They know that\u0027s what we\u0027re doing,\" she said. \"The cave is on the other side of the temple. The simplest way is straight through.\" \"God in Heaven,\" I said. \"This is the way you went before?\" \"Yes,\" she answered. \"The villagers wouldn\u0027t go with us. Some never made it as far. We went on, through there.\" \"And what if the ceiling of this passage collapses on us?\" I asked. \"I\u0027m going through it,\" she answered. \"The temple\u0027s built of solid limestone. Nothing\u0027s changed, and nothing will.\" She removed her small flashlight from her belt and sent the beam into the opening. I could see the stone floor in spite of the few pallid plants which had struggled to cover it. I could make out lavish paint\u001fings on the walls! Her flashlight hit great rich figures of dark skin and golden clothes proceeding against a backdrop of vivid blue. Above, as the walls rose to a vaulted ceiling, I saw another procession against the deep shade of Roman red. The entire chamber seemed some fifty feet in length and her feeble light struck a bit of greenery at the other end. Again, there came those spirits, swarming around me, silent yet nevertheless intensely active, trying once more to strike my eyelids and my cheeks. I saw Merrick flinch. \"Get away from me!\" she whispered. \"You have no power over me!\" There was an immense response. The jungle around us appeared to tremble, as if an errant breeze had worked its way down to us, and a shower of leaves fell at our feet. Once again I heard the unearthly roar of the howler monkeys high in the trees. It seemed to give voice to the spirits. \"Come on, David,\" Merrick said; but as she meant to go forward something invisible appeared to stop her, because she stepped back off-balance and raised her left hand as if to shield herself. Another volley of leaves descended upon us. \"Not good enough!\" she said aloud and plunged into the vaulted chamber, her light growing brighter and fuller so that we found ourselves surrounded by some of the most vivid murals which I\u0027ve ever seen. Everywhere around us there rose splendid processional figures, tall and thin, complete with ornate kilts, earrings, and lavish headdresses. I could not mark the style as Maya or Egyptian. It was like nothing I\u0027d ever studied or seen. Matthew\u0027s old photographs had failed to capture one tenth of the vibrancy or detail. A lovely detailed black\u001eand\u001ewhite border ran along the floor on either sides. On and on we went, our every footfall echoing off the walls as we proceeded, but the air had grown intolerably hot. Dust rose in my nostrils. I felt the touch of fingers all over me. Indeed there came the grip of hands on my upper arm, and a muffled blow against my face. I reached out for Merrick\u0027s shoulder, both to hurry her and to stay with her. We were in the very middle of the passage when she came to a standstill and flinched as if receiving a shock. \"Get away from me, you won\u0027t stop me!\" she whispered. And then in a long stream of French she called on Honey in the Sunshine to make the way. We hurried on. I wasn\u0027t at all sure that Honey would do anything of the sort. It seemed far more likely that Honey would bring the temple down on our heads. At last we came out in the jungle once more, and I coughed to clear my throat. I looked back at the edifice. Less was visible on this side than on the front. I felt the spirits all around us. I felt threats without language. I felt myself pushed and shoved by weak creatures desperate to stop my advance. I needed my handkerchief for the millionth time, to wipe the insects off my face. Merrick immediately moved on. The path went steeply upwards. And I beheld the sparkle of the waterfall before I heard its music. There came a narrow place where the water ran deep, and Merrick crossed over to the right bank as I followed, my machete working as hard as hers. The climb up the waterfall was not difficult at all. But the activity of the spirits became increasingly stronger. Again and again Merrick cursed under her breath. I called on Oxal¨¢ to show the way. \"Honey, get me there,\" Merrick said. Quite abruptly I perceived, just beneath an overhang, where the waterfall jetted forward, a monstrous open\u001emouthed face carved deep into the volcanic rock that surrounded an obvious cave. It was precisely as the doomed Matthew had described it. His camera had been ruined by moisture before he could photograph it, however, and its size was something of a shock. Now, you can well imagine my satisfaction that we had reached this mythic place. For years I had heard tell of it, it was inextricably bound up in my mind with Merrick, and now we were there. Though the spirits kept up their assault, the gentle mist from the waterfall was cooling my hands and face. I made my way up to stand beside Merrick, when suddenly the spirits exerted immense pressure against my body, and I felt my left foot go out from under me. Though I never cried out, but merely reached for purchase, Merrick turned and grabbed hold of me by the loose shoulder of my jacket. That was all I needed to recover my footing and climb the remaining few feet to be at the flattened entrance of the cave. \"Look at the offerings,\" Merrick said, putting her left hand on my right. The spirits redoubled their efforts, but I held firm and so did Merrick, though twice she swiped at something near to her face. As for \"the offerings,\" what I beheld was a giant basalt head. It struck me as similar to the Olmec, but that was all I could say. Did it resemble the murals in the temple? Impossible to judge. Whatever it was, I loved it. It was helmeted and tilted upwards so that the face with its open eyes and unique smiling mouth received the rain that inevitably fell here, and at its uneven base, amid piles of blackened stones, stood an amazing array of candles, feathers, and wilted flowers, as well as pottery. I could smell the incense where I stood. The blackened rocks testified to many years of candles, but the last of these offerings could not have been more than two or three days old. I felt something change in the air around us. But Merrick seemed as distressed by the spirits as before. She made another involuntary gesture, as though to drive something unseen away. \"So nothing stopped them from coming,\" I said quickly, looking at the offering. \"Let me try something.\" I reached into my jacket pocket and took out a pack of Rothmans, which I was keeping for the inevitability that I would smoke. I opened them hastily, lighted one with my butane lighter, in spite of the incessant spray of the waterfall, drew in the smoke, and then put the cigarette before the immense head. I put the entire pack with it. Silently I said the prayers to the spirits, asking them to allow us access to this place. I felt no change in the assault of the spirits. I felt them pushing on me with renewed energy in a way that was beginning to unnerve me, certain though I might be that they would never gain very much strength. \"They know our motives,\" said Merrick, gazing at the giant upturned head and its withered flowers. \"Let\u0027s go into the cave.\" We used our large flashlights, and at once the silence from the waterfall descended upon us, along with the smell of dry earth and ash. Immediately, I saw the paintings, or what I perceived to be paintings. They were well inside, and we walked upright and swiftly towards them, ignoring the spirits which had now produced a whistling sound near my ears. To my utter shock, I saw that these splendidly colored wall coverings were in fact mosaics made with millions of tiny chips of semiprecious stones! The figures were far simpler than those of temple murals, which argued perhaps for a more ancient date. The spirits had gone quiet. \"This is marvelous,\" I whispered, because I had to say something. And again I tried to reach for my camera, but the pain in my arm was simply too sharp. \"Merrick, we must take photographs,\" I told her. \"Look, darling, there\u0027s writing. We must photograph it. I\u0027m sure those are glyphs.\" She didn\u0027t answer. She stared at the walls as I did. She seemed entranced. I could not quite make out a procession, or indeed attribute any activity to the tall slender figures, except to say that they appeared to be in profile, to wear long garments, and to be carrying important objects in their hands. I did not see bloody victims struggling. I did not see clear figures of priests. But as I struggled to make out the intermittent and glittering splendor, my foot struck something hollow. I looked down at a wealth of richly colored pottery gleaming before us as far as we could see. \"This isn\u0027t a cave at all, is it?\" Merrick said. \"I remember Matthew saying it was a tunnel. It is a tunnel. It\u0027s been carved out entirely by man.\" The stillness was shocking. Stepping as carefully as she could, she went on, and I behind her, though I had to reach down several times to move some of the small vessels out of my way. \"This is a burial place, that\u0027s what it is, and all these are offerings,\" I said. At that I felt a sharp blow to the back of my head. I spun around and shone my flashlight on nothing. The light from the cave entrance hurt my eyes. Something pushed my left side and then my right shoulder. It was the spirits coming at me again. I saw that Merrick was jerking and moving to the side, as if something were striking her also. I uttered a prayer to Oxal¨¢ again, and heard Merrick issuing her own refusals to back down. \"This is as far as we got last time,\" said Merrick, turning to look at me, her face dark above her flashlight, which she politely directed to the ground. \"We took everything we found here. Now I\u0027m going on.\" I was right with her, but the assault of the spirits grew stronger. I saw her pushed to one side. But quickly she steadied herself. I heard the crunch of pottery beneath her feet. \"You\u0027ve made us angry,\" I said to the spirits. \"Maybe we don\u0027t have any right here. And maybe we do!\" At this I received a heavy silent blow to the stomach, but it was not sufficient to cause pain. I felt a sharp increase in my exhilaration suddenly. \"Go on, do your damndest,\" I said. \"Oxal¨¢, who is buried here? Would he or she have it remain secret forever? Why did Oncle Vervain send us to this place?\" Merrick, who was several yards ahead of me, let out a gasp. I caught up with her at once. The tunnel had opened into a great hollow round chamber where the mosaics ascended the low dome. Much had fallen away from age or dampness, I knew not which, but it was a glorious room nevertheless. Round both walls the figures proceeded, until there stood one individual whose facial features had long ago been broken away. On the floor of the room, in its very center, surrounded by clear circles of pottery offerings and fine jade statues, lay a beautiful arrangement of ornaments in a nest of dust. \"Look, the mask, the mask in which he was buried,\" Merrick said, her light falling upon the most glorious polished green jade image, which lay as it had been placed perhaps thousands of years before, the body of the wearer having long since melted away. Neither of us dared take a step. The precious articles surrounding the burial were too beautifully arranged. We could see the ear ornaments now, glinting, as the soft moldering earth nearly swallowed them, and across the would\u001ebe chest of the being we saw a long richly carved scepter, which perhaps he had held in his hand. \"Look at all the debris,\" she said. \"No doubt he was wrapped in fabric full of precious amulets and sacrifices. Now the fabric\u0027s gone and only the stone objects remain.\" There was a loud noise behind us. I could hear pottery smashing. Merrick gave a short cry, as though something had struck her. Then willfully, indeed, as if driven, she plunged forward, dropped to her knees, and picked up the brilliant green mask. She darted back with it, away from the remains of the corpse. A flying stone struck me on the forehead. Something shoved at my back. \"Come on, let\u0027s leave the rest for the archaeologists,\" she said. \"I have what I came for. It\u0027s what Oncle Vervain told me to get.\" \"The mask? You mean you knew all the time there was a mask in this tunnel, and that\u0027s what you wanted?\" She was already on her way to the outside air. Scarcely had I caught up with her when she was pushed backwards. \"I\u0027m taking it, I have to have it,\" she declared. As we both tried to continue, something unseen blocked our path. I reached out. I could touch it. It was like a soft silent wall of energy. Merrick suddenly gave over her flashlight to me and in both hands she held the mask. At any other time of my life, I would have been admiring it, for it had an immense amount of expression and detail. Though there were holes for eyes and a gash for the mouth, all features were deeply contoured and the gloss of the thing was beautiful in itself. As it was, I moved with all my strength against this force that sought to block me, lifting both flashlights as if they were clubs. Merrick again startled me with a gasp. She held the mask to her face, and as she turned to took at me it appeared brilliant and faintly ghastly in the light. It seemed suspended in the darkness, for I could scarce make out her hands or her body at all. She turned it away from me, still holding it to her face. And again there came a gasp from her. The air in the cave fell silent and still. All I could hear was her breathing and then my own. It seemed she began to whisper something in a foreign tongue, though I didn\u0027t know what tongue it was. \"Merrick?\" I asked gently. In the abrupt and welcome stillness, the air of the cave felt moist and sweetly cool. \"Merrick,\" I said again, but I could not rouse her. She stood with the mask over her face, peering ahead of us, and then, with a surprising gesture, she ripped the thing away and gave it over to me. \"Take it, look through it,\" she whispered. I shoved my flashlight through my belt loop, gave hers back to her, and took the mask in both hands. I remember those little gestures because they were so ordinary, and I didn\u0027t know yet what I thought about the stillness around us or the dimness in which we stood. Far, far away was the greenery of the jungle, and everywhere above us and around us the coarse but beautiful mosaics glittered with their tiny bits of stone. I lifted the mask as she had directed me. A swimming sensation overcame me. I took several steps backwards, but whatever else I did, I don\u0027t know. The mask remained in place and my hands remained on it, and all else had subtly changed. The cave was full of flaring torches, there was the sound of someone chanting in a low and repetitive manner, and before me in the dimness there stood a figure, wavering as if he were not entirely solid, but rather made of silk, and left to the mercy of the scant draught from the entrance of the cave. I could see his expression clearly, though not define it entirely or say what feature conspired in his young male face to evince what emotion or how. He was begging me in dumb eloquence to get out of the cave and to leave the mask behind. \"We can\u0027t take it,\" I said. Or rather I heard myself say this. The chanting grew louder. More shapes closed in around the one wavering but determined figure. It seemed he stretched out his arms to beseech me. \"We can\u0027t take it,\" I said again. His arms were a golden brown and covered with gorgeous stone bracelets. His face was oval and his eyes dark and quick. I saw tears on his cheeks. \"We can\u0027t take it,\" I said, and then I felt myself failing. \"We must leave it. We must bring back the things that were taken before!\" An overwhelming sadness and grief swallowed me; I wanted to lie on the ground; so great was this emotion and so right was it that I felt it and expressed it with my entire form. Yet no sooner had I hit the ground¡ªat least I think I did¡ªthan I was jerked upright, and the mask was ripped away. One moment I felt it in my fingers and against my face, and the next I felt nothing and saw nothing but the distant light flickering in the green leaves. The figure was gone, the chanting had stopped, the grief was broken. Merrick was pulling me with all her strength: \"David, come on!\" she said. \"Come on!\" She would not be denied. And I myself felt an overwhelming desire to get out of the cave with her, and to take the mask; to steal this magic, this indescribable magic which had enabled me to see the spirits of the place with my own eyes. Boldly, wretchedly, without any excuse whatsoever, I reached down, without losing a pace, and caught up a handful of brilliant glinting stone artifacts from the thick moldering floor, stuffing them into my pockets as I went on. We were in the open jungle in a matter of moments. We ignored the unseen hands that assailed us, the volleys of leaves, and the urgent cries of the howler monkeys, as though they\u0027d joined in the assault. A slender banana tree crashed down into our path, and we moved over it, hacking the others that seemed to be bowing to strike us in the face. We made remarkable time, moving through the hallway of the temple. We were almost running when we found the remnants of the trail. The spirits sent more of the banana trees flapping towards us. There was a rain of coconuts, which did not strike us. From time to time small pebbles came in a little gale. But as we continued, the assault gradually fell away. At last there was nothing but a soundless howling. I was crazed. I was a perfect devil. I didn\u0027t care. She had the mask. She had the mask which enabled a person to see spirits. She had it. Oncle Vervain hadn\u0027t been strong enough to get it, I knew it. And neither had been Cold Sandra nor Honey nor Matthew. The spirits had driven them out. Silently, Merrick clutched the mask to her chest and kept going. Neither of us stopped, no matter how bad the ground under us, no matter how bad the heat, until we reached the jeep. Only then did she open her backpack and put the mask inside of it. She threw the jeep into reverse, backed up into the jungles, turned the car around, and headed for Santa Cruz del Flores at a boisterous and furious speed. I remained silent until we were alone together in our tent.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/merrick-the-vampire-chronicles-7/page-15.html","bookId":2215,"book":{"id":2215,"title":"Merrick (The Vampire Chronicles #7)","description":"Storyline: Merrick (The Vampire Chronicles #7) Just when you thought it was safe for a bloodsucker to go out in the dark in New Orleans, along comes Merrick Mayfair, a sultry, hard-drinking octoroon beauty whose voodoo can turn the toughest vampire into a marionette dancing to her merry, scary tune.
