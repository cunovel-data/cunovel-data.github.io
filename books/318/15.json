{"id":11517,"no":15,"title":"CHAPTER XIV THE DIAMOND RING","content":"Paul was up betimes the next morning. He had made up his mind for a few days, at least, to sell newspapers, and it was necessary in this business to begin the day early. He tool a dollar with him and invested a part of it in a stock of dailies. He posted himself in Printing House square, and began to look out for customers. Being an enterprising boy, he was sure to meet with fair success in any business which he undertook. So it happened that at ten o\u0027clock he had sold out his stock of papers, and realized a profit of fifty cents. It was getting late for morning papers, and there was nothing left to do till the issue of the first edition of the afternoon papers. “I\u0027ll go down and see how George Barry is getting along,” thought Paul. He crossed Broadway and soon reached the familiar stand. “How\u0027s business, George?” he inquired. “Fair,” said Barry. “I\u0027ve sold four ties.” “How do you feel?” “I\u0027m not so strong as I was, yet. I get tired more easily. I don\u0027t think I shall stay in this business long.” “You don\u0027t? What will you do then?” “I\u0027ve got a chance in Philadelphia, or I shall have by the first of the month.” “What sort of a chance?” “Mother got a letter yesterday from a cousin of hers who has a store on Chestnut street. He offers to take me as a clerk, and give me ten dollars a week at first, and more after a while.” “That\u0027s a good offer. I should like to get one like it.” “I\u0027ll tell you what, Paul, you\u0027d better buy out my stand. You know how to sell ties, and can make money.” “There\u0027s only one objection, George.” “What\u0027s that?” “I haven\u0027t got any capital.” “It don\u0027t need much.” “How much?” “I\u0027ll sell out all my stock at cost price.” “How much do you think there is?” “About twenty-five dollars\u0027 worth. Then there is the frame, which is worth, say ten dollars, making thirty-five in all. That isn\u0027t much.” “It\u0027s more than I\u0027ve got. I\u0027ll tell you what I\u0027ll do. I\u0027ll take it, and pay you five dollars down and the rest in one month.” “I would take your offer, Paul, but I need all the money how. It will be expensive moving to Philadelphia and I shall want all I can get.” “I wish I could buy you out,” said Paul, thoughtfully. “Can\u0027t you borrow the money?” “How soon do you want to give up?” “It\u0027s the seventeenth now. I should like to get rid of it by the twenty-second.” “I\u0027ll see what I can do. Just keep it for me till to-morrow.” “All right.” Paul walked home revolving in his mind this unexpected opportunity. He had made, as George Barry\u0027s agent, a dollar a day, though he received only half the profits. If he were himself the proprietor, and did equally well, he could make twelve dollars a week. The calculation almost took away his breath. Twelve dollars a week would make about fifty dollars a month. It would enable him to contribute more to the support of the family, and save up money besides. But the great problem was, how to raise the necessary money. If Paul had been a railroad corporation, he might have issued first mortgage bonds at a high rate of interest, payable in gold, and negotiated them through some leading banker. But he was not much versed in financial schemes, and therefore was at a loss. The only wealthy friend he had was Mr. Preston, and he did not like to apply to him till he had exhausted other ways and means. “What makes you so sober, Paul?” asked his mother, as he entered the room. “You are home early.” “Yes, I sold all my papers, and thought I would take an early dinner, so as to be on hand in time for the first afternoon papers.” “Don\u0027t you feel well?” “Tiptop; but I\u0027ve had a good offer, and I\u0027m thinking whether I can accept it.” “What sort of an offer?” “George Barry wants to sell out his stand.” “How much does he ask?” “Thirty-five dollars.” “Is it worth that?” “Yes, it\u0027s worth all that, and more, too. If I had it I could make two dollars a day. But I haven\u0027t got thirty-five dollars.” “I can let you have nine, Paul. I had a little saved up, and I haven\u0027t touched the money Mr. Preston paid me for the shirts.” “I\u0027ve got five myself, but that will only make fourteen.” “Won\u0027t he wait for the rest?” “No, he\u0027s going to Philadelphia early next week, and wants the whole in cash.” “It would be a pity to lose such a good chance,” said Mrs. Hoffman. “That\u0027s what I think.” “You could soon save up the money on two dollars a day.” “I could pay for it in a month—I mean, all above the fourteen dollars we have.” “In a day or two I shall have finished the second half-dozen shirts, and then I suppose Mr. Preston will pay me nine dollars more. I could let you have six dollars of that.” “That would make twenty. Perhaps George Barry will take that. If he won\u0027t I don\u0027t know but I will venture to apply to Mr. Preston.” “He seems to take an interest in you. Perhaps he would trust you with the money.” “I could offer him a mortgage on the stock,” said Paul. “If he has occasion to foreclose, he will be well provided with neckties,” said Mrs. Hoffman, smiling. “None of which he could wear. I\u0027ll tell you what, mother, I should like to pick up a pocketbook in the street, containing, say, twenty or twenty-five dollars.” “That would be very convenient,” said his mother; “but I think it will hardly do to depend on such good luck happening to you. By the way,” she said, suddenly, “perhaps I can help you, after all. Don\u0027t you remember that gold ring I picked up in Central Park two years ago?” “The one you advertised?” “Yes. I advertised, or, rather, your father did; but we never found an owner for it.” “I remember it now, mother. Have you got the ring still?” “I will get it.” Mrs. Hoffman went to her trunk, and, opening it, produced the ring referred to. It was a gold ring with a single stone of considerable size. “I don\u0027t know how much it is worth,” said Mrs. Hoffman; “but if the ring is a diamond, as I think it is, it must be worth as much as twenty dollars.” “Did you ever price it?” “No, Paul; I have kept it, thinking that it would be something to fall back upon if we should ever be hard pressed. As long as we were able to get along without suffering, I thought I would keep it. Besides, I had another feeling. It might belong to some person who prized it very much, and the time might come when we could find the owner. However, that is not likely after so long a time. So, if you cannot raise the money in any other way, you may sell the ring.” “I might pawn it for thirty days, mother. By that time I should be able to redeem it with the profits of my business.” “I don\u0027t think you could get enough from a pawn-broker.” “I can try, at any rate; but first I will see George Barry, and find out whether he will take twenty dollars down, and the rest at the end of a month.” Paul wrapped up the ring in a piece of paper, and deposited it in his vest pocket. He waited till after dinner, and then went at once to the necktie stand, where he made the proposal to George Barry. The young man shook his head. “I\u0027d like to oblige you, Paul,” he said, “but I must have the money. I have an offer of thirty-two dollars, cash, from another party, and I must take up with it if I can\u0027t do any better. I\u0027d rather sell out to you, but you know I have to consult my own interest.” “Of course, George, I can\u0027t complain of that.” “I think you will be able to borrow the money somewhere.” “Most of my friends are as poor as myself,” said Paul. “Still, I think I shall be able to raise the money. Only wait for me two days.” “Yes, Paul, I\u0027ll wait that long. I\u0027d like to sell out to you, if only because you have helped me when I was sick. But for you all that would have been lost time.” “Where there\u0027s a will there\u0027s a way, George,” said Paul. “I\u0027m bound to buy your stand and I will raise the money somehow.” Paul bought a few papers, for he did not like to lose the afternoon trade, and in an hour had sold them all off, realizing a profit of twenty cents. This made his profits for the day seventy cents. “That isn\u0027t as well as I used to do,” said Paul to himself, “but perhaps I can make something more by and by. I will go now and see what I can get for the ring.” As he had determined, he proceeded to a pawnbroker\u0027s shop which he had often passed. It was on Chatham street, and was kept by an old man, an Englishman by birth, who, though he lived meanly in a room behind his shop, was popularly supposed to have accumulated a considerable fortune. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2994/82606.html","bookId":318,"book":{"id":318,"title":"Paul the Peddler","description":"简介： The speaker, a boy of fourteen, stood in front of the shabby brick building, on Nassau street, which has served for many years as the New York post office.
