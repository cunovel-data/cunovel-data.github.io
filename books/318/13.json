{"id":11515,"no":13,"title":"CHAPTER XII THE BARREL THIEF","content":"While Mike Donovan was engaged in his contest with Paul, his companion had quietly walked off with the shirt. It mattered very little to him which party conquered, as long as he carried off the spoils. His conduct in the premises was quite as unsatisfactory to Mike as it was to Paul. When Mike found himself in danger of being overpowered, he appealed to his companion for assistance, and was incensed to see him coolly disregarding the appeal, and selfishly appropriating the booty. “The mane thafe!” he exclaimed after the fight was over, and he was compelled to retreat. “He let me be bate, and wouldn\u0027t lift his finger to help me. I\u0027d like to put a head on him, I would.” Just at that moment Mike felt quite as angry with his friend, Jerry McGaverty, as with his late opponent. “The shirt\u0027s mine, fair,” he said to himself, “and I\u0027ll make Jerry give it to me.” But Jerry had disappeared, and Mike didn\u0027t know where to look for him. In fact, he had entered a dark alleyway, and, taking the shirt from the paper in which it was wrapped, proceeded to examine his prize. The unusual size struck him. “By the powers,” he muttered, “it\u0027s big enough for me great-grandfather and all his children. I wouldn\u0027t like to pay for the cloth it tuck to make it. But I\u0027ll wear it, anyway.” Jerry was not particular as to an exact fit. His nether garments were several sizes too large for him, and the shirt would complete his costume appropriately. He certainly did need a new shirt, for the one he had on was the only article of the kind he possessed, and was so far gone that its best days, if it ever had any, appeared to date back to a remote antiquity. It had been bought cheap in Baxter street, its previous history being unknown. Jerry decided to make the change at once. The alley afforded a convenient place for making the transfer. He accordingly pulled off the ragged shirt he wore and put on the article he had purloined from Paul. The sleeves were too long, but he turned up the cuffs, and the ample body he tucked inside his pants. “It fits me too much,” soliloquized Jerry, as he surveyed himself after the exchange. “I could let out the half of it, and have enough left for meself. Anyhow, it\u0027s clane, and it came chape enough.” He came out of the alley, leaving his old shirt behind him. Even if it had been worth carrying away, Jerry saw no use in possessing more than one shirt. It was his habit to wear one until it was ready to drop off from him, and then get another if he could. There is a practical convenience in this arrangement, though there are also objections which will readily occur to the reader. On the whole, though the shirt fitted him too much, as he expressed it, he regarded himself complacently. The superabundant material gave the impression of liberal expenditure and easy circumstances, since a large shirt naturally costs more than a small one. So Jerry, as he walked along the Bowery, assumed a jaunty air, precisely such as some of my readers may when they have a new suit to display. His new shirt was quite conspicuous, since he was encumbered neither with vest nor coat. Mike, feeling sore over his defeat, met Jerry the next morning on Chatham street. His quick eye detected the improved state of his friend\u0027s apparel, and his indignation rose, as he reflected that Jerry had pocketed the profits while the hard knocks had been his. “Jerry!” he called out. Jerry did not see fit to heed the call. He was sensible that Mike had something to complain of, and he was in no hurry to meet his reproaches. “Jerry McGaverty!” called Mike, coming near. “Oh, it\u0027s you, Mike, is it?” answered Jerry, unable longer to keep up the pretense of not hearing. “Yes, it\u0027s me,” said Mike. “What made you leave me for last night?” “I didn\u0027t want to interfere betwane two gintlemen,” said Jerry, with a grin. “Did you mash him, Mike?” “No,” said Mike, sullenly, “he mashed me. Why didn\u0027t you help me?” “I thought you was bating him, so, as I had some business to attind to, I went away.” “You went away wid the shirt.” “Yes, I took it by mistake. Ain\u0027t it an illigant fit?” “It\u0027s big enough for two of you.” “Maybe I\u0027ll grow to it in time,” said Jerry. “And how much are you goin\u0027 to give me for my share?” demanded Mike. “Say that ag\u0027in,” said Jerry. Mike repeated it. “I thought maybe I didn\u0027t hear straight. It ain\u0027t yours at all. Didn\u0027t I take it?” “You wouldn\u0027t have got it if I hadn\u0027t fit with Paul.” “That ain\u0027t nothin\u0027 to me,” said Jerry. “The shirt\u0027s mine, and I\u0027ll kape it.” Mike felt strongly tempted to “put a head on” Jerry, whatever that may mean; but, as Jerry was a head taller already, the attempt did not seem quite prudent. He indulged in some forcible remarks, which, however, did not disturb Jerry\u0027s equanimity. “I\u0027ll give you my old shirt, Mike,” he said, “if you can find it. I left it in an alley near the Old Bowery.” “I don\u0027t want the dirty rag,” said Mike, contemptuously. Finally a compromise was effected, Jerry offering to help Mike on the next occasion, and leave the spoils in his hands. I have to chronicle another adventure of Jerry\u0027s, in which he was less fortunate than he had been in the present case. He was a genuine vagabond, and lived by his wits, being too lazy to devote himself to any regular street employment, as boot blacking or selling newspapers. Occasionally he did a little work at each of these, but regular, persistent industry was out of his line. He was a drone by inclination, and a decided enemy to work. On the subject of honesty his principles were far from strict. If he could appropriate what did not belong to him he was ready to do so without scruple. This propensity had several times brought him into trouble, and he had more than once been sent to reside temporarily on Blackwell\u0027s Island, from which he had returned by no means improved. Mike was not quite so much of a vagabond as his companion. He could work at times, though he did not like it, and once pursued the vocation of a bootblack for several months with fair success. But Jerry\u0027s companionship was doing him no good, and it seemed likely that eventually he would become quite as shiftless as Jerry himself. Jerry, having no breakfast, strolled down to one of the city markets. He frequently found an opportunity of stealing here, and was now in search of such a chance. He was a dexterous and experienced barrel thief, a term which it may be necessary to explain. Barrels, then, have a commercial value, and coopers will generally pay twenty-five cents for one in good condition. This is enough, in the eyes of many a young vagabond, to pay for the risk incurred in stealing one. Jerry prowled round the market for some time, seeking a good opportunity to walk off with an apple or banana, or something eatable. But the guardians of the stands seemed unusually vigilant, and he was compelled to give up the attempt, as involving too great risk. Jerry was hungry, and hunger is an uncomfortable feeling. He began to wish he had remained satisfied with his old shirt, dirty as it was, and carried the new one to some of the Baxter street dealers, from whom he could perhaps have got fifty cents for it. Now, fifty cents would have paid for a breakfast and a couple of cigars, and those just now would have made Jerry happy. “What a fool I was not to think of it!” he said. “The old shirt would do me, and I could buy a bully breakfast wid the money I\u0027d get for this.” Just at this moment he espied an empty barrel—a barrel apparently quite new and in an unguarded position. He resolved to take it, but the affair must be managed slyly. He lounged up to the barrel, and leaned upon it indolently. Then, in apparent unconsciousness, he began to turn it, gradually changing its position. If observed, he could easily deny all felonious intentions. This he kept up till he got round the corner, when, glancing around to see if he was observed, he quickly lifted it on his shoulder and marched off. All this happened without his being observed by the owner of the barrel. But a policeman, who chanced to be going his rounds, had been a witness of Jerry\u0027s little game. He remained quiet till Jerry\u0027s intentions became evident, then walked quietly up and put his hand on his shoulder. “Put down that barrel!” he said, authoritatively. Jerry had been indulging in visions of the breakfast he would get with the twenty-five cents he expected to obtain for the barrel, and the interruption was not an agreeable one. But he determined to brazen it out if possible. “What for will I put it down?” he said. “Because you have stolen it, that\u0027s why.” “No,” said Jerry, “I\u0027m carrying it round to my boss. It\u0027s his.” “Where do you work?” “In Fourth street,” said Jerry, at random. “What number?” “No. 136.” “Then your boss will have to get some one in your place, for you will have to come with me.” “What for?” “I saw you steal the barrel. You\u0027re a barrel thief, and this isn\u0027t the first time you\u0027ve been caught at it. Carry back the barrel to the place you took it from and then come with me.” Jerry tried to beg off, but without avail. At that moment Mike Donovan lounged up. When he saw his friend in custody, he felt a degree of satisfaction, remembering the trick Jerry had played on him. “Where are you goin\u0027, Jerry?” he asked, with a grin, as he passed him. “Did ye buy that barrel to kape your shirt in?” Jerry scowled but thought it best not to answer, lest his unlawful possession of the shirt might also be discovered, and lead to a longer sentence. “He\u0027s goin\u0027 down to the island to show his new shirt,” thought Mike, with a grin. “Maybe he\u0027ll set the fashion there.” Mike was right. Jerry was sent to the island for two months, there introducing Mr. Preston\u0027s shirt to company little dreamed of by its original proprietor. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2994/82604.html","bookId":318,"book":{"id":318,"title":"Paul the Peddler","description":"简介： The speaker, a boy of fourteen, stood in front of the shabby brick building, on Nassau street, which has served for many years as the New York post office.
