{"id":36571,"no":1,"title":"Chapter 1","content":"\"At this point I interrupted my sister as usual to say, \u0027You have a way with words, Scheherazade. This is the thousandth night I\u0027ve sat at the foot of your bed while you and the King made love and you told him stories, and the one in progress holds me like a genie\u0027s gaze. I wouldn\u0027t dream of breaking in like this, just before the end, except that I hear the first rooster crowing in the east, et cetera, and the King really ought to sleep a bit before daybreak. I wish I had your talent.\u0027\n \"And as usual Sherry replied, \u0027You\u0027re the ideal audience, Dunyazade. But this is nothing; wait till you hear the ending, tomorrow night! Always assuming this auspicious King doesn\u0027t kill me before breakfast, as he\u0027s been going to do these thirty-three and a third months.\u0027\n \" \u0027Hmp,\u0027 said Shahryar. \u0027Don\u0027t take your critics for granted; I may get around to it yet. But I agree with your little sister that this is a good one you\u0027ve got going, with its impostures that become authentic, its ups and downs and flights to other worlds. I don\u0027t know how in the world you dream them up.\u0027\n \" \u0027Artists have their tricks,\u0027 Sherry replied. We three said good night then, six goodnights in all. In the morning your brother went off to court, enchanted by Sherry\u0027s story. Daddy came to the palace for the thousandth time with a shroud under his arm, expecting to be told to cut his daughter\u0027s head off; in most other respects he\u0027s as good a vizier as he ever was, but three years of suspense have driven him crackers in this one particular -- and turned his hair white, I might add, and made him a widower. Sherry and I, after the first fifty nights or so, were simply relieved when Shahryar would hmp and say, \u0027By Allah, I won\u0027t kill her till I\u0027ve heard the end of her story\u0027; but it still took Daddy by surprise every morning. He groveled gratitude per usual; the King per usual spent the day in his durbar, bidding and forbidding between man and man, as the saying goes; I climbed in with Sherry as soon as he was gone, and per usual we spent our day sleeping in and making love. When we\u0027d had enough of each other\u0027s tongues and fingers, we called in the eunuchs, maidservants, mamelukes, pet dogs and monkeys; then we finished off with Sherry\u0027s Bag of Tricks: little weighted balls from Baghdad, dildoes from the Ebony Isles and the City of Brass, et cetera. Not to break a certain vow of mine, I made do with a roc-down tickler from Bassorah, but Sherry touched all the bases. Her favorite story is about some pig of an ifrit who steals a girl away on her wedding night, puts her in a treasure-casket locked with seven steel padlocks, puts the casket in a crystal coffer, and puts the coffer on the bottom of the ocean, so that nobody except himself can have her. But whenever he brings the whole rig ashore, unlocks the locks with seven keys, and takes her out and rapes her, he falls asleep afterward on her lap; she slips out from under and cuckolds him with every man who passes by, taking their seal rings as proof; at the end of the story she has five hundred seventy-two seal rings, and the stupid ifrit still thinks he possesses her! In the same way, Sherry put a hundred horns a day on your brother\u0027s head: that\u0027s about a hundred thousand horns by now. And every day she saved till last the Treasure Key, which is what her story starts and ends with.\n \"Three and a third years ago, when King Shahryar was raping a virgin every night and killing her in the morning, and the people were praying that Allah would dump the whole dynasty, and so many parents had fled the country with their daughters that in all the Islands of India and China there was hardly a young girl fit to fuck, my sister was an undergraduate arts-and-sciences major at Banu Sasan University. Besides being Homecoming Queen, valedictorian-elect, and a four-letter varsity athlete, she had a private library of a thousand volumes and the highest average in the history of the campus. Every graduate department in the East was after her with fellowships -- but she was so appalled at the state of the nation that she dropped out of school in her last semester to do full-time research on a way to stop Shahryar from killing all our sisters and wrecking the country.\n \"Political science, which she looked at first, got her nowhere. Shahryar\u0027s power was absolute, and by sparing the daughters of his army officers and chief ministers (like our own father) and picking his victims mainly from the families of liberal intellectuals and other minorities, he kept the military and the cabinet loyal enough to rule out a coup d\u0027Ã©tat. Revolution seemed out of the question, because his woman-hating, spectacular as it was, was reinforced more or less by all our traditions and institutions, and as long as the girls he was murdering were generally upper-caste, there was no popular base for guerrilla war. Finally, since he could count on your help from Samarkand, invasion from outside or plain assassination were bad bets too: Sherry figured your retaliation would be worse than Shahryar\u0027s virgin-a-night policy.\n \"So we gave up poly sci (I fetched her books and sharpened her quills and made tea and alphabetized her index cards) and tried psychology-- another blind alley. Once she\u0027d noted that your reaction to being cuckolded by your wife was homicidal rage followed by despair and abandonment of your kingdom, and that Shahryar\u0027s was the reverse; and established that that was owing to the difference in your ages and the order of revelations; and decided that whatever pathology was involved was a function of the culture and your position as absolute monarchs rather than particular hang-ups in your psyches, et cetera -- what was there to say? \n \"She grew daily more desperate; the body-count of deflowered and decapitated Moslem girls was past nine hundred, and Daddy was just about out of candidates. Sherry didn\u0027t especially care about herself, you understand -- wouldn\u0027t have even if she hadn\u0027t guessed that the King was sparing her out of respect for his vizier and her own accomplishments. But beyond the general awfulness of the situation, she was particularly concerned for my sake. From the day I was born, when Sherry was about nine, she treasured me as if I were hers; I might as well not have had parents; she and I ate from the same plate, slept in the same bed; no one could separate us; I\u0027ll bet we weren\u0027t apart for an hour in the first dozen years of my life. But I never had her good looks or her way with the world-- and I was the youngest in the family besides. My breasts were growing; already I\u0027d begun to menstruate: any day Daddy might have to sacrifice me to save Sherry.\n \"So when nothing else worked, as a last resort she turned to her first love, unlikely as it seemed, mythology and folklore, and studied all the riddle/puzzle/secret motifs she could dig up. \u0027We need a miracle, Doony,\u0027 she said (I was braiding her hair and massaging her neck as she went through her notes for the thousandth time), \u0027and the only genies I\u0027ve ever met were in stories, not in Moormans\u0027-rings and Jews\u0027-lamps. It\u0027s in words that the magic is -- Abracadabra, Open Sesame, and the rest -- but the magic words in one story aren\u0027t magical in the next. The real magic is to understand which words work, and when, and for what; the trick is to learn the trick.\u0027\n \"This last, as our frantic research went on, became her motto, even her obsession. As she neared the end of her supply of lore, and Shahryar his supply of virgins, she became more and more certain that her principle was correct, and desperate that in the whole world\u0027s stock of stories there was none that confirmed it, or showed us how to use it to solve the problem. \u0027I\u0027ve read a thousand tales about treasures that nobody can find the key to,\u0027 she told me; \u0027we have the key and can\u0027t find the treasure.\u0027 I asked her to explain. \u0027It\u0027s all in here,\u0027 she declared -- I couldn\u0027t tell whether she meant her inkstand or the quill she pointed toward it. I seldom understood her any more; as the crisis grew, she gave up reading for daydreaming, and used her pen less for noting instances of the Magic Key motif in world literature than for doodling the letters of our alphabet at random and idly tickling herself.\n \" \u0027Little Doony,\u0027 she said dreamily, and kissed me: \u0027pretend this whole situation is the plot of a story we\u0027re reading, and you and I and Daddy and the King are all fictional characters. In this story, Scheherazade finds a way to change the King\u0027s mind about women and turn him into a gentle, loving husband. It\u0027s not hard to imagine such a story, is it? Now, no matter what way she finds -- whether it\u0027s a magic spell or a magic story with the answer in it or a magic anything-- it comes down to particular words in the story we\u0027re reading, right? And those words are made from the letters of our alphabet: a couple-dozen squiggles we can draw with this pen. This is the key, Doony! And the treasure, too, if we can only get our hands on it! It\u0027s as if -- as if the key to the treasure is the treasure!\u0027\n \"As soon as she spoke these last words a genie appeared from nowhere right there in our library-stacks. He didn\u0027t resemble anything in Sherry\u0027s bedtime stories: for one thing, he wasn\u0027t frightening, though he was strange-looking enough: a light-skinned fellow of forty or so, smooth-shaven and bald as a roc\u0027s egg. His clothes were simple but outlandish; he was tall and healthy and pleasant enough in appearance, except for queer lenses that he wore in a frame over his eyes. He seemed as startled as we were -- you should\u0027ve seen Sherry drop that pen and pull her skirts together! -- but he got over his alarm sooner, and looked from one to the other of us and at a stubby little magic wand he held in his fingers, and smiled a friendly smile.\n \" \u0027Are you really Scheherazade?\u0027 he asked. \u0027I\u0027ve never had a dream so clear and lifelike! And you\u0027re little Dunyazade-- just as I\u0027d imagined both of you! Don\u0027t be frightened: I can\u0027t tell you what it means to me to see and talk to you like this; even in a dream, it\u0027s a dream come true. Can you understand English? I don\u0027t have a word of Arabic. O my, I can\u0027t believe this is really happening!\u0027\n \"Sherry and I looked at each other. The Genie didn\u0027t seem dangerous; we didn\u0027t know those languages he spoke of; every word he said was in our language, and when Sherry asked him whether he\u0027d come from her pen or from her words, he seemed to understand the question, though he didn\u0027t know the answer. He was a writer of tales, he said -- anyhow a former writer of tales -- in a land on the other side of the world. At one time, we gathered, people in his country had been fond of reading; currently, however, the only readers of artful fiction were critics, other writers, and unwilling students who, left to themselves, preferred music and pictures to words. His own pen (that magic wand, in fact a magic quill with a fountain of ink inside) had just about run dry: but whether he had abandoned fiction or fiction him, Sherry and I couldn\u0027t make out when we reconstructed this first conversation later that night, for either in our minds or in his a number of crises seemed confused. Like Shahryar\u0027s, the Genie\u0027s life was in disorder -- but so far from harboring therefore a grudge against womankind, he was distractedly in love with a brace of new mistresses, and only recently had been able to choose between them. His career, too, had reached a hiatus which he would have been pleased to call a turning-point if he could have espied any way to turn: he wished neither to repudiate nor to repeat his past performances; he aspired to go beyond them toward a future they were not attuned to and, by some magic, at the same time go back to the original springs of narrative. But how this was to be managed was as unclear to him as the answer to the Shahryar-problem was to us -- the more so since he couldn\u0027t see how much of his difficulty might be owing to his own limitations, his age and stage and personal vicissitudes; how much to the general decline of letters in his time and place; and how much to the other crises with which his country (and, so he alleged, the very species) was beset-- crises as desperate and problematical, he avowed, as ours, and as inimical to the single-mindedness needed to compose great works of art or the serenity to apprehend them.\n \"So entirely was he caught up in these problems, his work and life all had come to a standstill. He had taken leave of his friends, his family, and his post (he was a doctor of letters), and withdrawn to a lonely retreat in the marshes, which only the most devoted of his mistresses deigned to visit.\n \" \u0027My project,\u0027 he told us, \u0027is to learn where to go by discovering where I am by reviewing where I\u0027ve been -- where we\u0027ve all been. There\u0027s a kind of snail in the Maryland marshes -- perhaps I invented him -- that makes his shell as he goes along out of whatever he comes across, cementing it with his own juices, and at the same time makes his path instinctively toward the best available material for his shell; he carries his history on his back, living in it, adding new and larger spirals to it from the present as he grows. That snail\u0027s pace has become my pace -- but I\u0027m going in circles, following my own trail! I\u0027ve quit reading and writing; I\u0027ve lost track of who I am; my name\u0027s just a jumble of letters; so\u0027s the whole body of literature: strings of letters and empty spaces, like a code that I\u0027ve lost the key to.\u0027 He pushed those odd lenses up on the bridge of his nose with his thumb -- a habit that made me giggle -- and grinned. \u0027Well, almost the whole body. Speaking of keys, I suspect that\u0027s how I got here.\u0027\n \"By way of answer to Sherry\u0027s question then, whether he had sprung from her quill-pen or her words, he declared that his researches, like hers, had led him to an impasse; he felt that a treasure-house of new fiction lay vaguely under his hand, if he could find the key to it. Musing idly on this figure, he had added to the morass of notes he felt himself mired in, a sketch for a story about a man who comes somehow to realize that the key to the treasure he\u0027s searching for is the treasure. Just exactly how so (and how the story might be told despite all the problems that beset him) he had no chance to consider, for the Instant he set on paper the words The key to the treasure is the treasure, he found himself with us-- for how long, or to what end, or by what means, he had no idea, unless it was that of all the storytellers in the world, his very favorite was Scheherazade.\n \" \u0027Listen how I chatter on!\u0027 he ended happily. \u0027Do forgive me!\u0027\n \"My sister, after some thought, ventured the opinion that the astonishing coincidence of her late reveries and his, which had led them as it were simultaneously to the same cryptic formulation, must have something to do with his translation to her library. She looked forward, she said, to experimenting whether a reverse translation could be managed, If the worst came to worst, to spirit me out of harm\u0027s way; as for herself, she had no time or use for idle flights of fancy, however curious, from the gynocide that was ravaging her country: remarkable as it was, she saw no more relevance to her problems than to his in this bit of magic.\n \" \u0027But we know the answer\u0027s right here in our hands!\u0027 the Genie exclaimed. \u0027We\u0027re both storytellers: you must sense as strongly as I that it has something to do with the key to the treasure\u0027s being the treasure.\u0027\n \"My sister\u0027s nostrils narrowed. \u0027Twice you\u0027ve called me a storyteller,\u0027 she said; \u0027yet I\u0027ve never told a story in my life except to Dunyazade, and her bedtime stories were the ones that everybody tells. The only tale I\u0027ve ever invented myself was this key-to-the-treasure one just now, which I scarcely understand. . .\u0027\n \" \u0027Good lord!\u0027 the Genie cried. \u0027Do you mean to say that you haven\u0027t even started your thousand and one nights yet?\u0027\n \"Sherry shook her head grimly. \u0027The only thousand nights I know of is the time our pig of a king has been killing the virgin daughters of the Moslems.\u0027\n \"Our bespectacled visitor then grew so exhilarated that for some time he couldn\u0027t speak at all. Presently he seized my sister\u0027s hand and dumbfounded us both by declaring his lifelong adoration of her, a declaration that brought blushes to our cheeks. Years ago, he said, when he\u0027d been a penniless student pushing book-carts through the library-stacks of his university to help pay for his education, he contracted a passion for Scheherazade upon first reading the tales she beguiled King Shahryar with, and had sustained that passion so powerfully ever since that his love affairs with other, \u0027real\u0027 women seemed to him by comparison unreal, his two-decade marriage but a prolonged infidelity to her, his own fictions were mimicries, pallid counterfeits of the authentic treasure of her Thousand and One Nights.\n \" \u0027Beguiled the King with!\u0027 Sherry said. \u0027I\u0027ve thought of that! Daddy believes that Shahryar would really like to quit what he\u0027s doing before the country falls apart, but needs an excuse to break his vow without losing face with his younger brother. I\u0027d considered letting him make love to me and then telling him exciting stories, which I\u0027d leave unfinished from one night to the next till he\u0027d come to know me too well to kill me. I even thought of slipping in stories about kings who\u0027d suffered worse hardships than he and his brother without turning vindictive; or lovers who weren\u0027t unfaithful; or husbands who loved their wives more than themselves. But it\u0027s too fanciful! Who knows which stories would work? Especially in those first few nights! I can see him sparing me for a day or two, maybe, out of relief; but then he\u0027d react against his lapse and go back to his old policy. I gave the idea up.\u0027\n \"The Genie smiled; even I saw what he was thinking. \u0027But you say you\u0027ve read the book!\u0027 Sherry exclaimed. \u0027Then you must remember what stories are in it, and in which order!\u0027\n \" \u0027I don\u0027t have to remember,\u0027 said the Genie. \u0027In all the years I\u0027ve been writing stories, your book has never been off my worktable. I\u0027ve made use of it a thousand times, if only by just seeing it there.\u0027\n \"Sherry asked him then whether he himself had perhaps invented the stories she allegedly told, or would tell. \u0027How could I?\u0027 he laughed. \u0027I won\u0027t be born for a dozen centuries yet! You didn\u0027t invent them either, for that matter; they\u0027re those ancient ones you spoke of, that \"everybody tells\": Sinbad the Sailor, Aladdin\u0027s Lamp, Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves. . .\u0027\n \" \u0027What others?\u0027 Sherry cried. \u0027In which order? I don\u0027t even know the Ali Baba story! Do you have the book with you? I\u0027ll give you everything I have for it!\u0027\n \"The Genie replied that inasmuch as he\u0027d been holding her book in his hand and thinking about her when he\u0027d written the magic words, and it had not been translated to her library along with him, he inferred that he could not present her with a copy even if the magic were repeatable. He did however remember clearly what he called the frame-story: how Shahryar\u0027s young brother Shah Zaman had discovered his bride\u0027s adulteries, killed her, abandoned the kingdom of Samarkand, and come to live with Shahryar in the Islands of India and China; how, discovering that Shahryar\u0027s wife was equally unfaithful, the brothers had retreated to the wilderness, encountered the ifrit and the maiden, concluded that all women are deceivers, and returned to their respective kingdoms, vowing to deflower a virgin every night and kill her in the morning; how the Vizier\u0027s daughter Scheherazade, to end this massacre, had volunteered herself, much against her father\u0027s wishes, and with the aid of her sister Dunyazade -- who at the crucial moment between sex and sleep asked for a story, and fed the King\u0027s suspense by interrupting the tale at daybreak, just before the climax -- stayed Shahryar\u0027s hand long enough to win his heart, restore his senses, and save the country from ruin.\n \"I hugged my sister and begged her to let me help her in just that way. She shook her head: \u0027Only this Genie has read the stories I\u0027m supposed to tell, and he doesn\u0027t remember them. What\u0027s more, he\u0027s fading already. If the key to the treasure is the treasure, we don\u0027t have it in our hands yet.\u0027\n \"He had indeed begun fading away, almost disappeared; but as soon as Sherry repeated the magic sentence he came back clearly, smiling more eagerly than before, and declared he\u0027d been thinking the same words at the same moment, just as we\u0027d begun to fade and his writing-room to reappear about him. Apparently, then, he and Sherry could conjure the phenomenon at will by imagining simultaneously that the key to the treasure was the treasure: they were, presumably, the only two people in the history of the world who had imagined it. What\u0027s more, in that instant when he\u0027d waked, as it were, to find himself back in the marshes of America, he\u0027d been able to glance at the open table of contents of Volume One of the Thousand and One Nights book and determine that the first story after the frame-story was a compound tale called \u0027The Merchant and the Genie\u0027 -- in which, if he remembered correctly, an outraged ifrit delays the death of an innocent merchant until certain sheiks have told their stories.\n \"Scheherazade thanked him, made a note of the title, and gravely put down her pen. \u0027You have it in your power to save my sisters and my country,\u0027 she said, \u0027and the King too, before his madness destroys him. All you need to do is supply me from the future with these stories of the past. But perhaps at bottom you share the King\u0027s feelings about women.\u0027\n \" \u0027Not at all!\u0027 the Genie said warmly. \u0027If the key trick really works, I\u0027ll be honored to tell your stories to you. All we need to do is agree on a time of day to write the magic words together.\u0027\n \"I clapped my hands -- but Sherry\u0027s expression was still cool. \u0027You\u0027re a man,\u0027 she said; \u0027I imagine you expect what every man expects who has the key to any treasure a woman needs. In the nature of the case, I have to let Shahryar take me first; after that I\u0027ll cuckold him with you every day at sunset if you\u0027ll tell me the story for the night to come. Is that satisfactory?\u0027\n \"I feared he\u0027d take offense, but he only shook his head. Out of his old love for her, he gently declared, and his gratitude for the profoundest image he knew of the storyteller\u0027s situation, he would be pleased beyond words to play any role whatever in Scheherazade\u0027s story, without dreaming of further reward. His own policy, moreover, which he had lived by for many nights more than a thousand, was to share beds with no woman who did not reciprocate his feelings. Finally, his new young mistress, to whom he had been drawn by certain resemblances to Scheherazade -- delighted him utterly, as he hoped he did her; he was no more tempted to infidelity than to incest or pederasty. His adoration of Scheherazade was as strong as ever -- even stronger now that he\u0027d met her in the lovely flesh -- but it was not possessive; he desired her only as the old Greek poets their Muse, as a source of inspiration.\n \"Sherry tapped and riddled with her quill. \u0027I don\u0027t know these poets you speak of,\u0027 she said sharply. \u0027Here in our country, love isn\u0027t so exclusive as all that. When I think of Shahryar\u0027s harem-full of concubines on the one hand, and the way his wife got even with him on the other, and the plots of most of the stories I know -- especially the ones about older men with young mistresses -- I can\u0027t help wondering whether you\u0027re not being a bit na?ve, to put it kindly. Especially as I gather you\u0027ve suffered your share of deceit in the past, and no doubt done your share of deceiving. Even so, it\u0027s a refreshing surprise, if a bit of a put-down, that you\u0027re not interested in taking sexual advantage of your position. Are you a eunuch?\u0027\n \"I blushed again, but the Genie assured us, still unoffended, that he was normally equipped, and that his surpassing love for his young lady, while perhaps invincibly innocent, was not na?ve. His experience of love gone sour only made him treasure more highly the notion of a love that time would season and improve; no sight on earth more pleased his heart, annealed as it was by his own passions and defeats, than that rare one of two white-haired spouses who still cherished each other and their life together. If love died, it died; while it lived, let it live forever, et cetera. Some fictions, he asserted, were so much more valuable than fact that in rare instances their beauty made them real. The only Baghdad was the Baghdad of the Nights, where carpets flew and genies sprang from magic words; he was ours to command as one of those, and without price. Should one appear to him and offer him three wishes, he\u0027d be unable to summon more than two, inasmuch as his first -- to have live converse with the storyteller he\u0027d loved best and longest -- had already been granted.\n \"Sherry smiled now and asked him what would be the other two wishes. The second, he replied, would be that he might die before his young friend and he ceased to treasure each other as they did currently in their saltmarsh retreat. The third (what presently stood alone between him and entire contentment) would be that he would not die without adding some artful trinket or two, however small, to the general treasury of civilized delights, to which no keys were needed beyond goodwill, attention, and a moderately cultivated sensibility: he meant the treasure of art, which if it could not redeem the barbarities of history or spare us the horrors of living and dying, at least sustained, refreshed, expanded, ennobled, and enriched our spirits along the painful way. Such of his scribblings as were already in print he did not presume to have that grace; should he die before he woke from his present sweet dream of Scheherazade, this third wish would go unfulfilled. But even if neither of these last was ever granted (and surely such boons were rare as treasure keys), he would die happier to have had the first.\n \"Hearing this, Sherry at last put by her reserve, took the stranger\u0027s writing-hand in her own, apologized for her discourtesy, and repeated her invitation, this time warmly: if he would supply her with enough of her stories to reach her goal, she was his in secret whenever he wished after her maiden night with Shahryar. Or (if deception truly had no more savor for him), when the slaughter of her sisters had ceased, let him spirit her somehow to his place and time, and she\u0027d be his slave and concubine forever -- assuming, as one was after all realistically obliged to assume, that he and his current love would by then have wearied of each other.\n \"The Genie laughed and kissed her hand. \u0027No slaves; no concubines. And my friend and I intend to love each other forever.\u0027\n \" \u0027That will be a greater wonder than all of Sinbad\u0027s together,\u0027 Sherry said. \u0027I pray it may happen, Genie, and your third wish be granted too. For all one knows, you may already have done what you hope to do: time will tell. But if Dunyazade and I can find any way at all to help you with your tales-to-come in return for the ones you\u0027ve pledged to us -- and you may be sure we\u0027ll search for such a way as steadfastly as we\u0027ve searched for a way to save our sex -- we\u0027ll do it though we die for it.\u0027\n \"She made him promise then to embrace his mistress for her, whom she vowed to love thenceforth as she loved me, and by way of a gift to her -- which she prayed might translate as the precious book had not -- she took from her earlobe a gold ring worked in the form of a spiral shell, of which his earlier image had reminded her. He accepted it joyfully, vowing to spin from it, if he could, as from a catherine-wheel or whirling galaxy, a golden shower of fiction. Then he kissed us both (the first male lips I\u0027d felt except Father\u0027s, and the only such till yours) and vanished, whether by his will or another\u0027s we couldn\u0027t tell.\n \"Sherry and I hugged each other excitedly all that night, rehearsing every word that had passed between the Genie and ourselves. I begged her to test the magic for a week before offering herself to the King, to make sure that it -- and her colleague from the future -- could be relied upon. But even as we laughed and whispered, another of our sisters was being raped and murdered in the palace; Sherry offered herself to Shahryar first thing in the morning, to our father\u0027s distress; let the King lead her at nightfall into his fatal bed and fall to toying with her, then pretended to weep for being separated from me for the first time in our lives. Shahryar bid her fetch me in to sit at the foot of the bed; almost in a faint I watched him help her off with the pretty nightie I\u0027d crocheted for her myself, place a white silk cushion under her bottom, and gently open her legs; as I\u0027d never seen a man erect before, I groaned despite myself when he opened his robe and I saw what he meant to stick her with: the hair done up in pearls, the shaft like a minaret decorated with arabesques, the head like a cobra\u0027s spread to strike. He chuckled at my alarm and climbed atop her; not to see him, Sherry fixed her welling eyes on me, closing them only to cry the cry that must be cried when there befell the mystery concerning which there is no inquiry. A moment later, as the cushion attested her late virginity and tears ran from her eye-corners to her ears, she seized the King\u0027s hair, wrapped about his waist her lovely legs, and to insure the success of her fiction, pretended a grand transport of rapture. I could neither bear to watch nor turn away. When the beast was spent and tossing fitfully (from shame and guilt, I hoped, or unease at Sherry\u0027s willingness to die), I gathered my senses as best I could and asked her to tell me a story.\n \" \u0027With pleasure,\u0027 she said, in a tone still so full of shock it broke my heart, \u0027if this pious and auspicious King will allow it.\u0027 Your brother grunted, and Sherry began, shakily, the tale of the Merchant and the Genie, framing in it for good measure the First Sheik\u0027s Story as her voice grew stronger. At the right moment I interrupted to praise the story and say I thought I\u0027d heard a rooster crowing in the east; as though I\u0027d been kept in ignorance of the King\u0027s policy, I asked whether we mightn\u0027t sleep awhile before sunrise and hear the end of the story tomorrow night-- along with the one about the Three Apples, which I liked even more. \u0027O Doony!\u0027 Sherry pretended to scold. \u0027I know a dozen better than that: how about the Ebony Horse, or Julnar the Sea-Born, or the Ensorcelled Prince? But just as there\u0027s no young woman in the country worth having that the King hasn\u0027t had his fill of already, so I\u0027m sure there\u0027s no story he hasn\u0027t heard till he\u0027s weary of it. I could no more expect to tell him a new story than show him a new way to make love.\u0027\n \" \u0027I\u0027ll be the judje of that,\u0027 said Shahryar. So we sweated out the day in each other\u0027s arms and at sunset tried the magic key; you can imagine our relief when the Genie appeared, pushed up his eyeglasses with a grin, and recited to us the Second and Third Sheiks\u0027 Stories, which he guessed were both to be completed on that crucial second night in order, on the one hand, to demonstrate a kind of narrative inexhaustibility or profligacy (at least a generosity commensurate to that of the sheiks themselves), while, on the other hand, not compounding the suspense of unfinished tales-within-tales at a time when the King\u0027s reprieve was still highly tentative. Moreover, that the ifrit will grant the merchant\u0027s life on account of the stories ought to be evident enough by daybreak to make, without belaboring, its admonitory point. The spiral earring, he added happily, had come through intact, if anything more beautiful for the translation; his mistress was delighted with it, and would return Sherry\u0027s embrace with pleasure, he was confident, as soon as the memory of her more contemporary rivals was removed enough, and she secure enough in his love, for him to tell her the remarkable story of the magic key. Tenderly then he voiced his hope that Scheherazade had not found the loss of her maidenhood wholly repugnant to experience, or myself to witness; if the King was truly to be wooed away from his misogyny, many ardent nights lay ahead, and for the sake of Scheherazade\u0027s spirit as well as her strategy it would be well if she could take some pleasure in them.\n \" \u0027Never!\u0027 my sister declared. \u0027The only pleasure I\u0027ll take in that bed is the pleasure of saving my sisters and cuckolding their killer.\u0027\n \"The Genie shrugged and faded; Shahryar came in, bid us good evening, kissed Sherry many times before caressing her more intimately, then laid her on the bed and worked her over playfully in as many positions as there are tales in the Trickery-of-Women series, till I couldn\u0027t tell whether her outcries were of pain, surprise, or -- mad as the notion seemed -- a kind of pleasure despite herself. As for me, though I was innocent of men, I had read in secret all the manuals of love and erotic stories in Sherry\u0027s library, but had thought them the wild imaginings of lonely writers in their dens, a kind of self-tickling with the quill such as Sherry herself had fallen into; for all it was my own sister I saw doing such incredible things in such odd positions, it would be many nights before I fully realized that what I witnessed were not conjured illustrations from those texts, but things truly taking place.\n \" \u0027On with the story,\u0027 Shahryar commanded when they were done. Unsteadily at first, but then in even better voice than the night before, Sherry continued the Merchant-and-Genie story, and I, mortified to find myself still moistening from what I\u0027d seen, almost forgot to interrupt at the appropriate time. Next day, as we embraced each other, Sherry admitted that while she found the King himself as loathsome as ever, the things he did to her were no longer painful, and might even be pleasurable, as would be the things she did to him, were he a bedpartner she could treasure as our Genie treasured his. More exactly, once the alarm of her defloration and her fear of being killed in the morning began to pass, she found abhorrent not Shahryar himself -- undeniably a vigorous and handsome man for his forty years, and a skillful lover -- but his murderous record with our sex, which no amount of charm and tender caressing could expunge.\n \" \u0027No amount at all?\u0027 our Genie asked when he appeared again, on cue, at sunset. \u0027Suppose a man had been a kind and gentle fellow until some witch put a spell on him that deranged his mind and made him do atrocious things; then suppose a certain young lady has the power to cure him by loving him despite his madness. She can lift the spell because she recognizes that it is a spell, and not his real nature. . .\u0027\n \" \u0027I hope that\u0027s not my tale for tonight,\u0027 Sherry said dryly, pointing out that while Shahryar may once upon a time have been a loving husband, even in those days he gave out virgin slave-girls to his friends, kept a houseful of concubines for himself, and cut his wife in half for taking a lover after twenty years of one-sided fidelity. \u0027And no magic can bring a thousand dead girls back to life, or unrape them. On with the story.\u0027\n \" \u0027You\u0027re a harder critic than your lover,\u0027 the Genie complained, and recited the opening frame of the Fisherman and the Genie, the simplicity of which he felt to be a strategic change of pace for the third night-- especially since it would lead, on the fourth and fifth, to a series of tales-within-tales-within-tales, a narrative complexity he described admiringly as \u0027Oriental.\u0027\n \"So it went, month after month, year after year; at the foot of Shahryar\u0027s bed by night and in Scheherazade\u0027s by day, I learned more about the arts of making love and telling stories than I had imagined there was to know. It pleased our Genie, for example, that the tale of the Ensorcelled Prince had been framed by that of the Fisherman and the Genie, since the prince himself had been encased (in the black stone palace); also, that the resolution of the story thus enframed resolved as well the tale that framed it. This metaphorical construction he judged more artful than the \u0027mere plot-function\u0027 (that is, preserving our lives and restoring the King\u0027s sanity!) which Sherry\u0027s Fisherman-tale and the rest had in the story of her own life; but that \u0027mere plot-function,\u0027 in turn, was superior to the artless and arbitrary relation between most framed and framing tales. This relation (which to me seemed less important than what the stories were about) interested the two of them no end, just as Sherry and Shahryar were fascinated by the pacing of their nightly pleasures or the refinement of their various positions, instead of the degree and quality of their love.\n \"Sherry kissed me. \u0027That other either goes without saying,\u0027 she said, \u0027or it doesn\u0027t go at all. Making love and telling stories both take more than good technique -- but it\u0027s only the technique that we can talk about.\u0027\n \"The Genie agreed: \u0027Heartfelt ineptitude has its appeal, Dunyazade; so does heartless skill. But what you want is passionate virtuosity.\u0027 They speculated endlessly on such questions as whether a story might imaginably be framed from inside, as it were, so that the usual relation between container and contained would be reversed and paradoxically reversible -- and (for my benefit, I suppose) what human state of affairs such an odd construction might usefully figure. Or whether one might go beyond the usual tale-within-a-tale, beyond even the tales-within-tales-within-tales-within-tales which our Genie had found a few instances of in that literary treasure-house he hoped one day to add to, and conceive a series of, say, seven concentric stories-within-stories, so arranged that the climax of the innermost would precipitate that of the next tale out, and that of the next, et cetera, like a string of firecrackers or the chains of orgasms that Shahryar could sometimes set my sister catenating.\n \"This last comparison -- a favorite of theirs -- would lead them to a dozen others between narrative and sexual art, whether in spirited disagreement or equally spirited concord. The Genie declared that in his time and place there were scientists of the passions who maintained that language itself, on the one hand, originated in \u0027infantile pregenital erotic exuberance, polymorphously perverse,\u0027 and that conscious attention, on the other, was a \u0027libidinal hypercathexis\u0027 -- by which magic phrases they seemed to mean that writing and reading, or telling and listening, were literally ways of making love. Whether this was in fact the case, neither he nor Sherry cared at all; yet they liked to speak as if it were (their favorite words), and accounted thereby for the similarity between conventional dramatic structure -- its exposition, rising action, climax, and dÃ©nouement -- and the rhythm of sexual intercourse from foreplay through coitus to orgasm and release. Therefore also, they believed, the popularity of love (and combat, the darker side of the same rupee) as a theme for narrative, the lovers\u0027 embrace as its culmination, and post-coital lassitude as its natural ground: what better time for tales than at day\u0027s end, in bed after making love (or around the campfire after battle or adventure, or in the chimney corner after work), to express and heighten the community between the lovers, comrades, co-workers?\n \" \u0027The longest story in the world --\u0027 Sherry observed, \u0027The Ocean of Story, seven hundred thousand distichs -- was told by the god Siva to his consort Parvati as a gift for the way she made love to him one night. It would take a minstrel five hundred evenings to recite it all, but she sat in his lap and listened contentedly till he was done.\u0027\n \"To this example, which delighted him, the Genie added several unfamiliar to us: a great epic called Odyssey, for instance, whose hero returns home after twenty years of war and wandering, makes love to his faithful wife, and recounts all his adventures to her in bed while the gods prolong the night in his behalf; another work called Decameron, in which ten courtly lords and ladies, taking refuge in their country houses from an urban pestilence, amuse one another at the end of each day with stories (some borrowed from Sherry herself) as a kind of substitute for making love -- an artifice in keeping with the artificial nature of their little society. And, of course, that book about Sherry herself which he claimed to be reading from, in his opinion the best illustration of all that the very relation between teller and told was by nature erotic. The teller\u0027s role, he felt, regardless of his actual gender, was essentially masculine, the listener\u0027s or reader\u0027s feminine, and the tale was the medium of their intercourse.\n \" \u0027That makes me unnatural,\u0027 Sherry objected. \u0027Are you one of those vulgar men who think that women writers are homosexuals?\u0027\n \" \u0027Not at all,\u0027 the Genie assured her. \u0027You and Shahryar usually make love in Position One before you tell your story, and lovers like to switch positions the second time.\u0027 More seriously, he had not meant to suggest that the \u0027femininity\u0027 of readership was a docile or inferior condition: a lighthouse, for example, passively sent out signals that mariners labored actively to receive and interpret; an ardent woman like his mistress was as least as energetic in his embrace as he in embracing her; a good reader of cunning tales worked in her way as busily as their author; et cetera. Narrative, in short -- and here they were again in full agreement -- was a love-relation, not a rape: its success depended upon the reader\u0027s consent and cooperation, which she could withhold or at any moment withdraw; also upon her own combination of experience and talent for enterprise, and the author\u0027s ability to arouse, sustain, and satisfy her interest -- an ability on which his figurative life hung as surely as Scheherazade\u0027s literal.\n \" \u0027And like all love-relations,\u0027 he added one afternoon, \u0027it\u0027s potentially fertile for both partners, in a way you should approve, for it goes beyond male and female. The reader is likely to find herself pregnant with new images, as you hope Shahryar will become with respect to women; but the storyteller may find himself pregnant too. . .\u0027\n \"Much of their talk was over my head, but on hearing this last I hugged Sherry tight and prayed to Allah it was not another of their as if\u0027s. Sure enough, on the three hundred eighth night her tale was interrupted not by me but by the birth of Ali Shar, whom despite his resemblance to Shahryar I clasped to my bosom from that hour as if I had borne instead of merely helping to deliver him. Likewise on the six hundred twenty-fourth night, when little GharÃ­b came lustily into the world, and the nine hundred fifty-ninth, birthday of beautiful Jamilah-Melissa. Her second name, which means \u0027honey-sweet\u0027 in the exotic tongues of Genieland, we chose in honor of our friend\u0027s still-beloved mistress, whom he had announced his intention to marry despite Sherry\u0027s opinion that while women and men might in some instances come together as human beings, wives and husbands could never. The Genie argued, for his part, that no matter how total, exclusive, and permanent the commitment between two lovers might turn out to be, it lacked the dimensions of spiritual seriousness and public responsibility which only marriage, with its ancient vows and symbols, rites and risks, provided.\n \" \u0027It can\u0027t last,\u0027 Sherry said crossly. The Genie put on her finger a gift from his fiancÃ©e to her namesake\u0027s mother -- a gold ring patterned with rams\u0027-horns and conches, replicas of which she and the Genie meant to exchange on their wedding day -- and replied, \u0027Neither did Athens. Neither did Rome. Neither did all of Jamshid\u0027s glories. But we must live as if it can and will.\u0027\n \" \u0027Hmp,\u0027 said Sherry, who over the years had picked up a number of your brother\u0027s ways, as he had hers. But she gave them her blessing -- to which I added mine without reservations or as if\u0027s -- and turned the ring much in the lamplight when he was gone, trying its look on different hands and fingers and musing as if upon its design.\n \"Thus we came to the thousandth night, the thousandth morning and afternoon, the thousandth dipping of Sherry\u0027s quill and invocation of the magic key. And for the thousand and first time, still smiling, our Genie appeared to us, his own ring on his finger as it had been for some forty evenings now -- an altogether brighter-looking spirit than had materialized in the book-stacks so long past. We three embraced as always; he asked after the children\u0027s health and the King\u0027s, and my sister, as always, after his progress toward that treasury from which he claimed her stories were drawn. Less reticent on this subject than he had been since our first meeting, he declared with pleasure that thanks to the inspiration of Scheherazade and to the thousand comforts of his loving wife, he believed he had found his way out of that slough of the imagination in which he\u0027d felt himself bogged: whatever the merits of the new work, like an ox-cart driver in monsoon season or the skipper of a grounded ship, he had gone forward by going back, to the very roots and springs of story. Using, like Scheherazade herself, for entirely present ends, materials received from narrative antiquity and methods older than the alphabet, in the time since Sherry\u0027s defloration he had set down two-thirds of a projected series of three novellas, longish tales which would take their sense from one another in several of the ways he and Sherry had discussed, and, if they were successful (here he smiled at me), manage to be seriously, even passionately, about some things as well.\n \" \u0027The two I\u0027ve finished have to do with mythic heroes, true and false,\u0027 he concluded. \u0027The third I\u0027m just in the middle of. How good or bad they are I can\u0027t say yet, but I\u0027m sure they\u0027re right. You know what I mean, Scheherazade.\u0027\n \"She did; I felt as if I did also, and we happily re-embraced. Then Sherry remarked, apropos of middles, that she\u0027d be winding up the story of Ma\u0027aruf the Cobbler that night and needed at least the beginning of whatever tale was to follow it.\n \"The Genie shook his head. \u0027My dear, there are no more. You\u0027ve told them all.\u0027 He seemed cruelly undisturbed by a prospect that made the harem spin before my eyes and brought me near to swooning.\n \" \u0027No more!\u0027 I cried. \u0027What will she do?\u0027\n \" \u0027If she doesn\u0027t want to risk Shahryar\u0027s killing her and turning on you,\u0027 he said calmly, \u0027I guess she\u0027ll have to invent something that\u0027s not in the book.\u0027\n \" \u0027I don\u0027t invent,\u0027 Sherry reminded him. Her voice was no less steady than his, but her expression -- when I got hold of my senses enough to see it -- was grave. \u0027I only recount.\u0027\n \" \u0027Borrow something from the treasury!\u0027 I implored him. \u0027What will the children do without their mother?\u0027 The harem began to spin again; I gathered all my courage and said: \u0027Don\u0027t desert us, friend; give Sherry the story you\u0027re working on now, and you may do anything you like with me. I\u0027ll raise your children if you have any; I\u0027ll wash your Melissa\u0027s feet. Anything.\u0027\n \"The Genie smiled and said to Sherry, \u0027Our little Dunyazade is a woman.\u0027 Thanking me then for my offer as courteously as he had once Scheherazade, he declined it, not only for the same reasons that had moved him before, but also because he was confident that the only tales left in the treasury of the sort King Shahryar was likely to be entertained by were the hundred mimicries and retellings of Sherry\u0027s own.\n \" \u0027Then my thousand nights and a night are ended,\u0027 Sherry said. \u0027Don\u0027t be ungrateful to our friend, Doony; everything ends.\u0027\n \"I agreed, but tearfully wished myself -- and Ali Shar, GharÃ­b, and little Melissa, whom all I loved as dearly as I loved my sister -- out of a world where the only happy endings were in stories.\n \"The Genie touched my shoulder. \u0027Let\u0027s not forget,\u0027 he said, \u0027that from my point of view -- a tiresome technical one, I\u0027ll admit -- it is a story that we\u0027re coming to the end of. All these tales your sister has told the King are simply the middle of her own story -- hers and yours, I mean, and Shahryar\u0027s, and his young brother Shah Zaman\u0027s.\u0027\n \"I didn\u0027t understand -- but Sherry did, and squeezing my other shoulder, asked him quietly whether, that being the tiresome technical case, it followed that a happy ending might be invented for the framing-story.\n \" \u0027The author of The Thousand and One Nights doesn\u0027t invent,\u0027 the Genie reminded her; \u0027he only recounts how, after she finished the tale of Ma\u0027aruf the Cobbler, Scheherazade rose from the King\u0027s bed, kissed ground before him, and made bold to ask a favor in return for the thousand and one nights\u0027 entertainment. \"Ask, Scheherazade,\" the King answers in the story -- whereupon you send Dunyazade to fetch the children in, and plead for your life on their behalf, so that they won\u0027t grow up motherless.\u0027\n \"My heart sprang up; Sherry sat silent. \u0027I notice you don\u0027t ask on behalf of the stories themselves,\u0027 the Genie remarked, \u0027or on behalf of your love for Shahryar and his for you. That\u0027s a pretty touch: it leaves him free to grant your wish, if he chooses to, on those other grounds. I also admire your tact in asking only for your life; that gives him the moral initiative to repent his policy and marry you. I don\u0027t think I\u0027d have thought of that.\u0027\n \" \u0027Hmp,\u0027 said Sherry.\n \" \u0027Then there\u0027s the nice formal symmetry --\u0027\n \" \u0027Never mind the symmetry!\u0027 I cried. \u0027Does it work or not?\u0027 I saw in his expression then that it did, and in Sherry\u0027s that this plan was not news to her. I hugged them both, weeping enough for joy to make our ink run, so the Genie said, and begged Sherry to promise me that I could stay with her and the children after their wedding as I had before, and sit at the foot of her bed forever.\n \" \u0027Not so fast, Doony,\u0027 she said. \u0027I haven\u0027t decided yet whether or not I care to end the story that way.\u0027\n \" \u0027Not care to?\u0027 I looked with fresh terror to the Genie. \u0027Doesn\u0027t she have to, if it\u0027s in the book?\u0027\n \"He too appeared troubled now, and searched Sherry\u0027s face, and admitted that not everything he\u0027d seen of our situation in these visions or dreams of his corresponded exactly to the story as it came to him through the centuries, lands, and languages that separated us in waking hours. In his translation, for example, all three children were male and nameless; and while there was no mention of Scheherazade\u0027s loving Shahryar by the end of the book, there was surely none of her despising him, or cuckolding him, more or less, with me and the rest. Most significantly, it went without saying that he himself was altogether absent from the plot -- which, however, he prayed my sister to end as it ended in his version: with the double marriage of herself to your brother and me to you, and our living happily together until overtaken by the Destroyer of Delights and Severer of Societies, et cetera.\n \"While I tried to assimilate this astonishing news about myself, Sherry asked with a smile whether by \u0027his version\u0027 the Genie meant that copy of the Nights from which he\u0027d been assisting us or the story he himself was in midst of inventing; for she liked to imagine, and profoundly hoped it so, that our connection had not been to her advantage only: that one way or another, she and I and our situation were among those \u0027ancient narrative materials\u0027 which he had found useful for his present purposes. How did his version end?\n \"The Genie closed his eyes for a moment, pushed back his glasses with his thumb, and repeated that he was still in the middle of that third novella in the series, and so far from drafting the climax and dÃ©nouement, had yet even to plot them in outline. Turning then to me, to my great surprise he announced that the title of the story was Dunyazadiad; that its central character was not my sister but myself, the image of whose circumstances, on my \u0027wedding-night-to-come,\u0027 he found as arresting for taletellers of his particular place and time as was my sister\u0027s for the estate of narrative artists in general.\n \" \u0027All those nights at the foot of the bed, Dunyazade!\u0027 he exclaimed. \u0027You\u0027ve had the whole literary tradition transmitted to you -- and the whole erotic tradition, too! There\u0027s no story you haven\u0027t heard; there\u0027s no way of making love that you haven\u0027t seen again and again. I think of you, little sister, a virgin in both respects: All that innocence! All that sophistication! And now it\u0027s your turn: Shahryar has told young Shah Zaman about his wonderful mistress, how he loves her as much for herself as for her stories -- which he also passes on; the two brothers marry the two sisters; it\u0027s your wedding night, Dunyazade. . . But wait! Look here! Shahryar deflowered and killed a virgin a night for a thousand and one nights before he met Scheherazade; Shah Zaman has been doing the same thing, but it\u0027s only now, a thousand nights and a night later, that he learns about Scheherazade -- that means he\u0027s had two thousand and two young women at the least since he killed his wife, and not one has pleased him enough to move him to spend a second night with her, much less spare her life! What are you going to do to entertain him, little sister? Make love in exciting new ways? There are none! Tell him stories, like Scheherazade? He\u0027s heard them all! Dunyazade, Dunyazade! Who can tell your story?\u0027\n \"More dead than alive with fright, I clung to my sister, who begged the Genie please to stop alarming me. All apologies, he assured us that what he was describing was not The Thousand and One Nights frame-story (which ended happily without mention of these terrors), but his own novella, a pure fiction -- to which also he would endeavor with all his heart to find some conclusion in keeping with his affection for me. Sherry further eased my anxiety by adding that she too had given long thought to my position as the Genie described it, and was not without certain plans with respect to our wedding night; these, as a final favor to our friend, she had made written note of in the hope that whether or not they succeeded, he might find them useful for his story; but she would prefer to withhold them from me for the present.\n \" \u0027You sense as I do, then,\u0027 the Genie said thoughtfully, \u0027that we won\u0027t be seeing each other again.\u0027\n \"Sherry nodded. \u0027You have other stories to tell. I\u0027ve told mine.\u0027\n \"Already he\u0027d begun to fade. \u0027My best,\u0027 he said, \u0027will be less than your least. And I\u0027ll always love you, Scheherazade! Dunyazade, I\u0027m your brother! Good night, sisters! Fare well!\u0027\n \"We kissed; he disappeared with Sherry\u0027s letter; Shahryar sent for us; still shaken, I sat at the bed-foot while he and Sherry did a combination from the latter pages of Ananga Ranga and Kama Sutra and she finished the tale of Ma\u0027aruf the Cobbler. Then she rose as the Genie had instructed her, kissed ground, begged boon; I fetched in Ali Shar, walking by himself now, Gharib crawling, Jamilah-Melissa suckling at my milkless breast as if it were her mother\u0027s. Sherry made her plea; Shahryar wept, hugged the children, told her he\u0027d pardoned her long since, having found in her the refutation of all his disenchantment, and praised Allah for having appointed her the savior of her sex. Then he sent for Daddy to draft the marriage contract and for you to hear the news of Scheherazade and her stories; when you proposed to marry me, Sherry countered with Part Two of our plan (of whose Part Three I was still ignorant): that in order for her and me never to be parted, you must abandon Samarkand and live with us, sharing your brother\u0027s throne and passing yours to our father in reparation for his three-years\u0027 anguish. I found you handsomer than Shahryar and more terrifying, and begged my sister to say what lay ahead for me.\n \"\u0027Why, a fine wedding-feast, silly Doony!\u0027 she teased. \u0027The eunuchs will perfume our Hammam-bath with rose-and willow-flower water, musk-pods, eagle-wood, ambergris; we\u0027ll wash and clip our hair; they\u0027ll dress me like the sun and you the moon, and we\u0027ll dance in seven different dresses to excite our bridegrooms. By the end of the wine and music they\u0027ll scarcely be able to contain their desire; each of us will kiss the other three good night, twelve good-nights in all, and our husbands will hurry us off toward our separate bridal-chambers --\u0027\n \" \u0027O Sherry!\u0027\n \" \u0027Then,\u0027 she went on, no tease in her voice now, \u0027on the very threshold of their pleasures I\u0027ll stop, kiss ground, and say to my lord and master: \"O King of the Sun and the Moon and the Rising Tide, et cetera, thanks for marrying me at last after sleeping with me for a thousand and one nights and begetting three children on me and listening while I amused you with proverbs and parables, chronicles and pleasantries, quips and jests and admonitory instances, stories and anecdotes, dialogues and histories and elegies and satires and Allah alone knows what else! Thanks too for giving my precious little sister to your brute of a brother, and the kingdom of Samarkand to our father, whose own gratitude we\u0027ll hope may partially restore his sanity! And thanks above all for kindly ceasing to rape and murder a virgin every night, and for persuading Shah Zaman to cease also! I have no right to ask anything further of you at all, but should be overjoyed to serve your sexual and other interests humbly until the day you tire of me and either have me killed or put me by for other, younger women -- and indeed I am prepared to do just that, as Dunyazade surely is also for Shah Zaman. Yet in view of your boundless magnanimity Q.E.D., I make bold to ask a final favor.\" If we\u0027re lucky, Shahryar will be so mad to get me into bed that he\u0027ll say \"Name it\" -- whereupon I point out to him that a happy occasion is about to bring to pass what a thousand ill ones didn\u0027t, your separation from me till morning. Knowing my husband, I expect he\u0027ll propose a little something Ã  quatre, at which I\u0027ll blush appropriately and declare that I\u0027m resigned after all to the notion of losing you for a few hours, and wish merely thirty minutes or so of private conversation with you before you and your bridegroom retire, to tell you a few things that every virgin bride should know. \"What on earth is there in that line that she hasn\u0027t seen us do a hundred times?\" your delicate brother-in-law will inquire. \"Seeing isn\u0027t doing,\" I\u0027ll reply: \"I myself have pretty intensive sexual experience, for example, but of one man only, and would be shy as any virgin with another than yourself; Shah Zaman has the widest carnal acquaintance in the world, I suppose, but no long and deep knowledge of any one woman; among the four of us, only you, King of the Age, et cetera, can boast both sorts of experience, having humped your way through twenty years of marriage, a thousand and one one-nighters, and thirty-three and a third months with me, not to mention odd hours with all the concubines in your stable. But little Dunyazade has no experience at all, except vicariously.\" That master of the quick retort will say \"Hmp\" and turn the matter over to Shah Zaman, who after bringing to it the full weight of his perspicacity will say, in effect, \"Okay. But make it short.\" They\u0027ll withdraw, with the grandest erections you and I have ever shuddered at -- and then I\u0027ll tell you what to do in Part Three. After which we\u0027ll kiss good night, go in to our husbands, and do it. Got that?\u0027\n \" \u0027Do what?\u0027 I cried-- but she\u0027d say no more till all had fallen out as she described: our wedding-feast and dance; the retirement toward our chambers; her interruption and request; your permission and stipulation that the conference be brief, inasmuch as you were more excited by me than you\u0027d been by any of the two thousand unfortunates whose maidenheads and lives you\u0027d done away with in the five and a half years past. You two withdrew, your robes thrust out before; the moment your bedroom doors closed, Sherry spat in your tracks, took my head between her hands, and said: \u0027If ever you\u0027ve listened carefully, little sister, listen now. For all his good intentions, our Genie of the Key is either a liar or a fool when he says that any man and woman can treasure each other until death -- unless their lifetimes are as brief as our murdered sisters\u0027\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/349/218.html","bookId":312,"book":{"id":312,"title":"èè²ç´«ç½å° Violets Are Blue","description":"ç®ä»ï¼ Back Page: At this point I interrupted my sister as usual to say, You have a way with words, Scheherazade.
