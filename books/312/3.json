{"id":36573,"no":3,"title":"Chapter 3","content":"Alf Laylah Wa Laylah, The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night, is not the story of Scheherazade, but the story of the story of her stories, which in effect begins: \"There is a book called The Thousand and One Nights, in which it is said that once upon a time a king had two sons, Shahryar and Shah Zaman,\" et cetera; it ends when a king long after Shahryar discovers in his treasury the thirty volumes of The Stories of the Thousand Nights and a Night, at the end of the last of which the royal couples -- Shahryar and Scheherazade, Shah Zaman and Dunyazade -- emerge from their bridal chambers after the wedding night, greet one another with warm good mornings (eight in all), bestow Samarkand on the brides\u0027 long-suffering father, and set down for all posterity The Thousand Nights and a Night.\n If I could invent a story as beautiful, it should be about little Dunyazade and her bridegroom, who pass a thousand nights in one dark night and in the morning embrace each other; they make love side by side, their faces close, and go out to greet sister and brother in the forenoon of a new life. Dunyazade\u0027s story begins in the middle; in the middle of my own, I can\u0027t conclude it -- but it must end in the night that all good mornings come to. The Arab storytellers understood this; they ended their stories not \"happily ever after,\" but specifically \"until there took them the Destroyer of Delights and Desolator of Dwelling-places, and they were translated to the ruth of Almighty Allah, and their houses fell waste and their palaces lay in ruins, and the Kings inherited their riches.\" And no man knows it better than Shah Zaman, to whom therefore the second half of his life will be sweeter than the first.\n To be joyous in the full acceptance of this dénouement is surely to possess a treasure, the key to which is the understanding that Key and Treasure are the same. There (with a kiss, little sister) is the sense of our story, Dunyazade: The key to the treasure is the treasure.\n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/349/220.html","bookId":312,"book":{"id":312,"title":"蓝色紫罗兰 Violets Are Blue","description":"简介： Back Page: At this point I interrupted my sister as usual to say, You have a way with words, Scheherazade.
