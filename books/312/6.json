{"id":36576,"no":6,"title":"Chapter 6","content":"\"Good night is right,\" Melanippe said when she read Part One. \"I can\u0027t believe you wrote this mess.\" I asked her, hurt, how so; I thought it not half bad, considering. \"Because,\" she cried. \"It\u0027s a lie! It\u0027s false! It\u0027s full of holes! I didn\u0027t write any of it; you did, every word. And you make out that I\u0027m all emancipated and no hang-ups and immortal and stuff, and that\u0027s crazy. Content my ass! Content is a death-word in my book; if I were Medusa and I asked Perseus if he was happy to spend eternity with me and he said he was content, I\u0027d spit in his eye! Okay, you got the Amazon business pretty straight, but I\u0027m amazed at your picture of me: you know very well I\u0027m not immortal except in that special way I told you about: the \u0027Melanippe-self\u0027 way. I\u0027m on the verge of my Full Moon, and I feel every lunar month of it: just in the time it\u0027s taken you to write these pages I\u0027ve gained ten kilos and aged five \u0027years.\u0027 That very first night in Tiryns, I told you how my nurse Hippolyta in Corinth told me that my mother was a crazy Amazon deaf-mute who killed herself when I was born, and my father a hero on a white horse who\u0027d left her on the stable roof one night. Why pussyfoot around about it? I not only look young enough to be your daughter; just possibly I am your daughter, and if that doesn\u0027t bother me, it shouldn\u0027t bother you. I never held a grudge against you; I took it for granted you didn\u0027t know you\u0027d made my mother pregnant. Even when I learned (from you) that she\u0027d been the hottest prospect in Amazonia until you raped her, and I decided that that was what drove her crazy and made her kill herself, I excused you. But I don\u0027t fool myself about my reasons: I\u0027d heard a lot about you in Argolis; I admire heroes and had never met one; I was disgusted with Stheneboeia, and I wanted out of Tiryns. I don\u0027t mean anything vulgar like screwing my way to the top (I never let Stheneboeia sleep with me); I really did fall for you, in a hurry. I honor and respect you, as you know. I even love you; you\u0027re the gentlest, sweetest lover I ever had, if not the most passionate, and the difference in our ages doesn\u0027t matter to me at all except when it takes the edge off your enthusiasm because you\u0027ve done everything once already. Like getting married and having a family and building a house and buying furniture and stuff. If you want to know the truth, I think we\u0027re bogged down more than immortalized: you scribble scribble scribble all day, morning noon and night, and honestly, I believe it must be the greatest thing in the world to be a mythic hero and be immortalized in the story of your life and so forth -- I really do appreciate that -- but I love activity, you know? Philono? was more your type -- I mean that perfectly kindly. She liked books and myths and needlework and all; I\u0027m used to an active life, and we never do anything! I\u0027d sort of hoped we\u0027d go down to Lycia after you\u0027d got yourself together, not that I\u0027m eager to be a queen, but just so we\u0027d be doing stuff. It drives me crackers that we\u0027ve got this winged horse right here to take us anywhere in the world, and all we do is spin around the saltmarsh after mealtimes -- then back to your scribbling scribbling while I make dinner and twiddle my thumbs. I hate to say this, but I guess I\u0027d be happier with less of a hero and more of a regular man. I don\u0027t mean that sarcastically. I\u0027m tired of Amazoning; I\u0027m tired of being a demigod\u0027s girlfriend, too, if it means hanging around this cottage till I die. But I\u0027m also tired of bopping about with different lovers; what I want is a plain ordinary groovy husband and ten children, nine of them boys. Call me a cop-out if you want to; I ought to find some swinging young Gargarensian M.D. or lawyer next mating season who\u0027ll think I\u0027m the greatest thing that ever happened to him, instead of just the recentest, you know? I might not love him as much, but I bet I\u0027d be happier. I don\u0027t want to be around when my hippomanes doesn\u0027t work for you any more, Bellerophon; either you\u0027ll leave me like the rest or we\u0027ll both sit around wishing we were dead. You thought that that Pattern Polyeidus gave you for your Second Flood predicted three women, but by my count I\u0027m the fourth: Sibyl, my mother, Philono?, and me, right? But you said yourself that everything comes in fives in the Betterophoniad, so maybe you ought to start looking for that next one and get on with your career. Maybe this Chimera has turned into a pretty girl again, like Medusa in the Perseid. You should check and see if she\u0027s It, and if she isn\u0027t, kill her for real this time and see if that gets you where you want to go. Anyhow I know I\u0027m not It for you, and you know it too, only you don\u0027t want to admit it. You\u0027re not getting any younger; neither am I: lots of Amazons look younger than they are because we don\u0027t count years, and it\u0027s the distinctions people acknowledge and condition themselves to look for that usually show, in my opinion. But the more I think about it, the more I\u0027m sure that tonight\u0027s full moon is going to end my First Quarter, and you\u0027ll think I\u0027ve aged fourteen years in one night. Will you still say I\u0027m \u0027frisky and lean and tight\u0027 and so forth? I get tired too, you know; dead tired; sometimes I feel Last Quarter! Maybe I shouldn\u0027t go on like this; I know it\u0027s getting near my period, and that always makes me blue and a little bitchy. But I swear, this isn\u0027t immortality: it\u0027s suspended animation. Which brings me back to your story: despite all those clever things you have me say in it, the truth is I know zero about writing; but if I were to find this washed up on the beach and read it through, just as a plain story, I\u0027d sure be pissed off that you never tell what happened to Polyeidus and Philono? and Anteia and your mother and your kids, especially that ring business when you left home; and you don\u0027t say what the rest of Sibyl\u0027s letter said, or clear up that episode with the Chimera -- whether she was real in the first place and whether she\u0027s back again -- or explain all that fudging about your brother\u0027s death, et cetera. You even call it \u0027Part One,\u0027 but I don\u0027t see any Part Two. There are nice things in it, sure, a lot of nice things, once you get past that heavy beginning and move along; but if your immortality depends on this piece of writing, you\u0027re a dead pigeon.\" A bad night. I couldn\u0027t speak to explain the difference between lies and myth, which I was but beginning to comprehend myself; how the latter could be so much realer and more important than particular men that perhaps I must cease to be the hero of my own, cease even to exist, cease somehow even to have existed. In fact I couldn\u0027t speak at all. Melanippe either, having spoken. Sadly and fiercely we made love: Medusa winked down at us; Pegasus snorted; my darling came as never in her life, sure sign of her passage. Me too. She slept; by full-moon light I wrote Part Two; just before dawn, as Perseus and company sank over Asia Minor, we gently made love again; she gave me the last of her First-Quarter hippomanes, an enormous stash, and bade me go kill Chimera for real. \"Are you sure you\u0027re not Polyeidus?\" I asked her, and she responded: \"Are you sure you\u0027re Bellerophon?\" Heh. I wrapped up in the prophet\u0027s Pattern the story thus far -- which if less than Perseid-perfect was anyhow clear, straightforward, and uncorrupted at that time -- hauled up on sleepy Pegasus, slipped him his quid of hip, winged west.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/349/223.html","bookId":312,"book":{"id":312,"title":"蓝色紫罗兰 Violets Are Blue","description":"简介： Back Page: At this point I interrupted my sister as usual to say, You have a way with words, Scheherazade.
