{"id":36577,"no":7,"title":"Chapter 7","content":"Polyeidus here: shape-shifting, general prophecy. No one who sees entire the scope and variety of the world can rest content with a single form. Gods and seers have such sight; hence our propensity for metamorphosis. Yet Zeus in all his guises is still Zeus, \"presiding god of classic Greek mythology\"; I in mine only Polyeidus, advisor to, perhaps father of, a minor hero in that same local corpus. Being Old Man of the Marsh was irksome. I grew bored to death with Bellerophon. What Zeus sees I don\u0027t know, but I saw (in bits and pieces, to be sure, like runes on my scattered daughter\u0027s oak leaves or scrambled bits of satellite photography) the fore and aft of the whole vessel of human history; as I swatted spiders and pulled leeches off me there in the Ale?an flats, I came understandably to wish myself not only out of that particular swamp, but out of Greek myth altogether -- that tiresome catalogue of rapes, petty jealousies, power grabs; that marble-columned ghetto of immortals. Why couldn\u0027t I turn myself, I wondered, not into another personage-from-the-future (no more than a disquieting anachronism), but into Scheherazade, \"Henry Burlingame III,\" or Napoleon in his own time and place? Recollecting the odd document I\u0027d briefly been on Bellerophon\u0027s second try (a happy chance; I don\u0027t by any means always read the pages I turn into), I petitioned Zeus himself to give me a hand (promising the customary quid pro quo, to spread his fame in the new world), concentrated as one must on a single image -- that verbo-visual pun of a honeybee which appears on Napoleonic flags and, stitched in gold, on the violet pall of the casket that transported his alleged remains from St. Helena back to Paris -- and grunted hard. I woke up at the back door of heaven, an odious large insect, Tabanus atratus perhaps, with noisy wings and wicked mandibles, buzzing about a mound of godshit. Great Zeus (from my perspective) towered over me disdainfully and thundered: \"You\u0027re a shape-shifter: think of it as transmogrified ambrosia. Heh heh.\" Until one is beyond their reach, the Olympians\u0027 whims are our directives. I tried; no luck. No matter, either: my newly compound eyes showed me more aspects of the future -- mine, Bellerophon\u0027s, the world\u0027s -- than I\u0027d ever seen. I tried to groan; Zeus grinned. \"Now you see it, eh, Heironymous? By imitating perfectly the Pattern of Mythic Heroism, your man Bellerophon has become a perfect imitation of a mythic hero. That sort of thing amuses us. But look again at your famous Pattern. It says Mystery and Tragedy: Mystery in the hero\u0027s journey to the other world, his illumination, his transcension of categories, his special dispensation; Tragedy in his return to daily reality, the necessary loss in his translation of the ineffable into sentences and cities, his fall from the favor of gods and men, his exile, and the rest. Now look at Bellerophon\u0027s story thus far: it\u0027s not Mystery and Tragedy, but confusion and fiasco, d\u0027accord?\" A gadfly (so I was, Heironymous hight, imperfectly magicked once again, into a name without initial in our alphabet) doesn\u0027t quibble with the god of gods. I buzzed neutrally, shrugged some shoulders. \"All which is as it should be, in his case,\" Zeus rumbled on. \"But see what\u0027s coming up! I\u0027ve had Amazons in my time; take it from me, that girl Melanippe\u0027s hippomanes is the real thing. Look at Bellerophon climbing on that crazy horse, straight for heaven, a kilometer a minute! He\u0027s high enough already to see Mystery and Tragedy plain; give him a few more pages and he\u0027ll rise above both and be a star boarder here forever! That\u0027s the sort of thing we\u0027re not amused by, and there\u0027ll be no bugging out for you until it\u0027s taken care of.\" \"Mm.\" He tested the zigzag edge of a thunderbolt with his thumb. \"Pegasus, on the other hand, is my natural nephew and a pretty piece of horseflesh, just what I need for packing these bolts from the Cyclops\u0027 smithy when somebody\u0027s hubris wants a bit of smiting. But if I shoot down your Bellerophon with one of these babies, there\u0027ll be nothing left of the winged horse except a few hundred kilos of viande de cheval bien cuit. You follow me?\" \"Mm.\" \"Okay: if you want an exit visa out of that pile, wait till your boy gets this far and then give Pegasus a bite in the crupper. The rest will take care of itself: new country, new language, new myths -- three millennia from here. It\u0027s that or eat shit forever. Done?\" I readily M-hmm\u0027d. \"Good. Then you only need to eat it while you wait. Mortals, I swear.\" I swore too, in available nasals, as he left, rubbed my wings furiously with two back legs, and looked with all my eyes for ways to turn the letter of his law to my advantage, like a cunning wrestler his adversary\u0027s Reset But there were none, and lunchtime came, and I was famished, but dared not leave the sill for better fare. Presently the Queen of Heaven herself came out, under pretext of emptying the royal thundermug. As best one can in mm\u0027s and hm\u0027s I buzzed for pity. \"Don\u0027t worry,\" Hera said, breathing through her mouth. She set the pot aside and pointed down to Corinth. \"See that sexy little white heifer grazing near Nemea? How\u0027d you like to have her for lunch?\" It was, I saw, Io, her husband\u0027s latest mistress, by him disguised: in my then condition (and by contrast with my doorsill menu) an appetizing morsel, the more so for its relish of revenge on my tormentor. \"Bellerophon won\u0027t be here for a while yet, as you know,\" the Queen went on. \"I\u0027ll cover for you. Go to it.\" I did, made a long lunch of squealing Io from Dodona to the sea since named after her, across the Bosphorus ditto, up into the Caucasus (where big Z\u0027s buzzards made their lunch of foie Prométhe), back to Colchis, off to Joppa (crashing through Perseid 1-F-5 like a bull through a china shop), as far east as Bactria and India, then west through Arabia Deserta with a caravan of stories picked up along the way, to Ethiopia and down the Nile. At Chemmis, gorged, I let her go, paused to wash my mandibles at a drinking fountain near the empty temple, then sped burping up to Olympus just in time to see, with my left eyes, wrathful Zeus, thunderbolt in hand, sitting on the sill among the shit and shards of the celestial chamberpot, smashed either by himself in anger or by his overtaken wife in fright; and with my right, bold Bellerophon casting away the golden bridle, feeding Pegasus the final leaves of Melanippe\u0027s herb, and with the scroll-rolled Pattern for his riding crop, whipping the grand beast up those thin last leagues to heaven. \"Just in time!\" I tried to call to both. \"Let me give you a little goose there, Bell-boy! Heh! Sorry about Miss Io, Zeus, sir: your missus had me sort of cornered. But I saw to it she got to Egypt safely in time to have your child; she\u0027s in a nice little spiral temple down in Chemmis: pretty pictures on the wall, et cetera. I didn\u0027t bite her hard; just a tickle, really; not the way I\u0027m going to bite this horse here, to put him over the old finish-line for you! Heh. Here goes!\" I dived in and gave Pegasus a good one under the tail, bleh, as Zeus raised his bolt and Bellerophon his Pattern-scroll. The god stayed his hand when the winged horse bucked and whinnied; not so the hero, who in the instant before he pitched from that seat forever let me have it, then let go all. Pegasus bolted to his final ditto\u0027d master; I changed, postswatly, into a fading copy of the Greek seer Polyeidus, falling with his fallen son to death. Zeus laughed down after us (the drop from heaven takes a dizzy while): \"A hundred eyes, a hundred blind-spots, Polyeidus! We gods can\u0027t break our vows, but we can make you wish we could. One way or another, in that new world you\u0027re dropping in on, you\u0027ll be Old Man of the Marsh for keeps. And unless your son forgives the tricks you\u0027ve played on him, you\u0027ll always be some version or other of his story. God knows why. Heh. \u0027Bye.\" Spread-eagled, Bellerophon sailed over and called: \"When he said I was your son, you sonofabitch, which twin did he take me for?\" I was too busy dying and plotting to answer directly: dying forever to the form of Polyeidus; plotting to my best interest this dénouement -- how I might begin by becoming the terminal interview which follows; grow thence into all of Part Three and ultimately permeate (at least when the moon was on my side) the whole Bellerophoniad; grow narratively on in death like hair and fingernails until I comprehended the entire Bellerophonic corpus and related literature; con my son the imitation hero, as Admetus conned his wife Alcestis, into taking my place, or part of it, in death\u0027s company by becoming his own life story, the myth of Bellerophon. One way or another, if I was obliged to be Old Man of the Marsh, I would make the world my oyster. With an expiratory grunt I changed, for openers, into these fluttering final pages, written (so help me Muse) in \"American\": Polyeidus: Ah so. As you see, our stars are falling fast. In the manner of the Perseid, mutatis mutandis, would you care to end this tale by answering freely as we fall five questions for posterity? Bellerophon: Perseid may be your model; I have none any longer. That\u0027s one for you. My first is the last I asked before you changed format: when Zeus called me your son, whom did he take me for? P.: Bellerophon, of course. Who else? N.Q. When you swatted me with the Pattern, you fulfilled the prophecy first laid on me as I humped your mother in the surf: that I would die by my son\u0027s hand unless he agreed to take my place, et cetera. The usual. And I scarcely expect you to do that, even though you\u0027ll die anyway when you make your hard landing a few questions from now, whereas a paginated form like mine can expect a certain low-impact afterlife. So what\u0027ve you been up to since you left Themiscyra at the end of Part Two? Please speak directly into the page. B.: A funny thing happened on the way to Mount Chimera. Melanippe\u0027s hip sent me higher than I\u0027ve ever been, and I saw the ends of all the supporting characters in my story. I saw my mother in Corinth, bitter and senile, dying at the graves of Glaucus and Bellerus, cursing Poseidon for not taking better care of his by-blows and Bellerophon for not taking better care of her. There was your daughter, out of her head altogether, wrecked by the goddess who should\u0027ve honored her: in a mantic stupor in the grove she was crying \"Bellerus! Bellerus!\" while her lover sold her frowsy favors to frightened fourteen-year-olds at a drachma per. Worse yet, that lover, Sibyl\u0027s last, was Melanippe, the first Melanippe: not a suicide after all, but a gross and bitter bull-dyke who had taken Hippolyta\u0027s name and place to raise her daughter, Melanippe Two. Whether I was that daughter\u0027s father, my second sight was kindly blind to: once I\u0027d deflowered Melanippe mere and nipped the bud of her career, she\u0027d turned promiscuous as Sibyl, but out of self-spite: a predator with heart of flint. Over in Tiryns I saw her bitter bullish like, Anteia, forcing docile girls into tribadism while Megapenthes plotted coup d\u0027état and double-theta\u0027d sodomocracy. I saw Philono?: heartbroken but gentle still after brief romances with other men and suicide, she had withdrawn to a lonely Lycian retreat-house to live out her days in bookish solitude and infrequent masturbation. Of the high-altitude kisses I showered on her head, she was as mercifully unaware as of the wreckage of our children and our state. Those former were grown not into semidemideities (an impossibility) but into commonplace adults, grasping, doomed. The boys, per program, had taken the ring-bait, quarreled over whose child should be shot through it to determine my successor, and been finessed by their clever sister, who volunteered her own child Sarpedon; this was her son by a high-school dropout who\u0027d seduced her in the guise of Zeus-disguised-as-a-high-school-dropout, oldest trick in the book: it duped her brothers into relinquishing their claims in her favor as easily as it had her into relinquishing her favors to the dropout\u0027s claims. Zeus himself, unduped and unamused, then commissioned Artemis to cut my dear daughter down for this imposture, and Ares (count on Z for overkill) to dispatch my sons in the ten-millionth bloody skirmish of our endless war with the Carians and Solymians. Dead, dead, dead. The kingdom, then, was ruled by greedy viceroys, my former students, in the infancy of Sarpedon, who will himself grow up to die on the losing side in the Trojan War. This latter vision was my first clear evidence that I was flying now above mere panorama, into prescience: fearfully therefore I turned my eyes to the banks of the Thermodon, and beheld the final horror: straightforward as always, my dauntless darling had put me through the ordeal of Part Two by way of testing her conviction that it was not her mortal self I loved, so much as some dream of immortality of which I fancied her the cute incorporation; not one to toy with either life or death, upon my flight she\u0027d washed face and hands, brushed teeth, combed hair, made up our bed, lain down upon it, and passed the time by singing to herself as many Amazon campfire songs as she could remember from her girlhood until, as she\u0027d expected, her first Full-Moon menstrual flow commenced, about midafternoon; at that evidence that she was after all not pregnant by me, without expression or hesitation she drove her knife hilt-deep into her perfect little left brown breast. Whatever blinders I still steered with thereupon fell from me, and I saw the chimera of my life. By imitating perfectly the Pattern of Mythic Heroism, I\u0027d become, not a mythic hero, but a perfect Reset I was no Perseus, my tale no Perseid -- even had we been, I and it, so what? Not mortal me, but immortality, was the myth. P.: That asks and answers your second question. B.: Who cares? P.: Come come. You\u0027ve wrecked a certain number of good women, my daughter by who knows whom included, and you\u0027re heroically chastened by the wreckage -- small comfort to them! But you admit you\u0027re new at second sight, which at its clearest is foggier than first: what if I told you that your view was strictly from your viewpoint? That in her \"mortal part\" at least (per Perseid), Philono? remembers you with much affection and some gentle amusement as her first real lover, regrets (but no longer bitterly) your deserting her for Melanippe, but has come rather to enjoy and even prefer her more or less solitary life? And that while Melanippe, a more demonstrative young woman, did indeed stick herself with the dagger, she was saved from Hades by a passing Gargarensian, a handsome young visiting surgeon of promise who heard her cries, rushed to the rescue, took her with him on a tour of the Mediterranean to cheer her up, subsequently married her, and made her the happy mother of ten beautiful children, nine of them sons? B.: I\u0027d like it fine, god damn you. So much for your third, fourth, and fifth. Is it true? P.: Who knows? All I see when I look in that direction is their (relatively) immortal part, this endless story of yours. So let\u0027s not count rhetorical questions. What about Chimera, my greatest invention? I hope you don\u0027t think you\u0027ve killed an image like that with the line \"I saw the chimera of my life.\" B.: Not at all. What I saw was that it\u0027s not a great invention: there\u0027s nothing original in it; it neither hurt nor helped anyone; it\u0027s preposterous, not monstrous, and compared to Medusa or the Sphinx, for example, even its metaphoric power is slight. That\u0027s why, up there in the crater, it cooperated in its own destruction by melting the lead on my lance-point: its death was the only mythopoeic thing about it. Needless to say, the moment I understood that was the moment I really killed Chimera. No need to go to Lycia then; I changed course, chucked Athene\u0027s bridle, dug in my heels, and made straight for Olympus. P.: Whatever for, your dying father asks obligingly, inasmuch as you\u0027d already decided that immortality is a bad trip? Megalomania? Ambitious affirmation of the absurd? B.: Certainly I was ambitious, all along; but to call ambition on that epic scale mere vanity is a double error. For while it\u0027s true that Bellerophon\u0027s aspiration to immortality was without social relevance, for example, and thoroughly elitist -- in fact, of benefit to no one but himself -- it should be observed that it didn\u0027t glorify \"him,\" either, since the name he\u0027s called by is not his actual name, but a fictitious one. His fame, then, such as it was, is, and might have been, is as it were anonymous. Moreover, he does not, like an exiled tyrant or absconder, enjoy his fortune incognito; even had his crazy flight succeeded, he\u0027d not have known it: there\u0027d be another constellation in the sky, bearing the name he\u0027d assumed -- but Perseid to the contrary notwithstanding, it\u0027s hardly to be imagined that those patterns we call \"Perseus,\" \"Medusa,\" \"Pegasus\" (There he is! Sweet steed, fly on, with better riders than myself!) are aware of their existences, any more than are their lettered counterparts on the page. Or, if by some mystery they are, that they enjoy their fixed, frigidified careers. Got that, Dad? For you are my dad -- old pard, old buck, old worm! -- I don\u0027t question that: only Polyeidus\u0027s son could have mimed a life so well, so long. P.: So. Well. So long is right. And so much for Poseidon\u0027s name on your birth certificate. B.: False letters spell out my life from first to last. But not Bellerus\u0027s. P.: Here it comes. You down there: wake up for the anagnoresis! B.: What marsh did you say we\u0027re falling into? Do the people speak my language? P.: Forget it. The present tenants are red-skinned, speak Algonkian, and have a mythology but no literature. At the rate we\u0027re falling, by the time we land they\u0027ll be white and black, speak more or less in English, and have a literature (which no one reads) but no mythology. On with the story: even in Greek it\u0027s muddy enough, but I\u0027ve known what\u0027s coming for two hundred pages. In any language, it\u0027s Sibyl\u0027s Letter\u0027s Second Clause. B.: Right. POSEIDON\u0027S SON HE ISN\u0027T. I\u0027m not star-bound Bellerus, but starstruck Deliades. Bellerus died in the grove that night, in my place, while I humped (half-sister!) Sibyl in holy his. I was his mortal killer; therefore I became his immortal voice: Deliades I buried in Bellerophon, to live out in selfless counterfeit, from that hour to this, my brother\u0027s demigoddish life. It\u0027s not my story; never was. I never killed Chimarrhus or Chimera, or rode the winged horse, or slept with Philono?, or laid my head between Melanippe\u0027s thighs: the voice that spoke to them all those nights was Bellerus\u0027s voice. And the story it tells isn\u0027t a lie, but something larger than fact. . . P.: In a word, a myth. Philono? guessed all this, you know, back in First-Ebb days. And Melanippe long before she wrote the horse-race episode. As for me, it goes without saying that this and everything else you say goes without saying? I knew it before it was true, and if I\u0027m astonished now it\u0027s because seers see past and future but not et cetera -- everything takes your true prophet by surprise. So, you blew your big scene. That\u0027s no Elysium rushing up at us: it\u0027s Dorchester County, Maryland, Upsilon Sigma Alpha, and will be for several generations yet. When you hit it, you\u0027ll go deeper underground than your brother. B.: How many questions left? P.: One for me, two for you. Now that I\u0027ve answered you, one apiece. B.: Can you turn me into this story, Polyeidus? Let me be Bellerus\u0027s voice forever, an immortal Bellerophoniad. P.: Out of the question. B.: It\u0027s what you\u0027ve tried to trick me into for half a dozen pages! I\u0027m offering to take your place! Don\u0027t tell me it\u0027s impossible! P.: Quite impossible -- in the na?ve way you mean. I can\u0027t turn anybody but myself into anything. B.: Then I\u0027m dead. Good night, Bellerus. Good night, all. P.: What I might manage -- not because I owe you any favors, but for reasons of my own -- is to turn myself from this interview into you-in-Bellerophoniad-form: a certain number of printed pages in a language not untouched by Greek, to be read by a limited number of \"Americans,\" not all of whom will finish or enjoy them. Regrettably, I\u0027ll have to have a certain role in the thing also -- not beating Zeus out on that. But since I\u0027ll be there as an aspect of you, so to speak, I\u0027ll be free enough to operate in a few aspects of my own: \"Harold Bray,\" perhaps, or his nonfictional counterpart, the legitimate heir to the throne of France and impresario of the Second Revolution, an utterly novel Reset No Perseid, I grant you, but it\u0027s the best I can do in what tune we have left. That tidewater\u0027s coming up fast. B.: I don\u0027t like the sound of it. I\u0027d rather fall into a thornbush; become a blind lame vatic figure; avoid the paths of men; float upon the marshy tide forever, reciting my Reset P.: Stop gnashing your teeth. Take it or leave it. B.: I\u0027ll take it. P.: Done. Heh. Any last words to the world at large? Quickly. B.: I hate this, World! It\u0027s not at all what I had in mind for Bellerophon. It\u0027s a beastly fiction, ill-proportioned, full of longueurs, lumps, lacunae, a kind of monstrous mixed metaphor -- P.: Five more. B.: It\u0027s no Bellerophoniad. It\u0027s a Scan Notes, v3.0: Proofed carefully against DT, italics intact.
