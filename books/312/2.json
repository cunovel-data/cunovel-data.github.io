{"id":36572,"no":2,"title":"Chapter 2","content":"\"That\u0027s the end of your story?\" Dunyazade nodded. Shah Zaman looked narrowly at his bride, standing naked beside the bed with her trembling razor, and cleared his throat. \"If you really mean to use that, kindly kill me with it first. A good hard slice across the Adam\u0027s apple should do the trick.\" The girl shuddered, shook her head. As best he could, so bound, the young man shrugged. \"At least answer one question: Why in the world did you tell me this extraordinary tale?\" Her eyes still averted, Dunyazade explained in a dull voice that one aspect of her sister\u0027s revenge was this reversal not only of the genders of teller and told (as conceived by the Genie), but of their circumstances, the latter now being at the former\u0027s mercy. \"Then have some!\" urged the King. \"For yourself!\" Dunyazade looked up. Despite his position Shah Zaman smiled like the Genie through his pearly beard and declared that Scheherazade was right to think love ephemeral. But life itself was scarcely less so, and both were sweet for just that reason -- sweeter yet when enjoyed as if they might endure. For all the inequity of woman\u0027s lot, he went on, thousands of women found love as precious as did their lovers: one needed look no farther than Scheherazade\u0027s stories for proof of that. If a condemned man -- which is what he counted himself, since once emasculate he\u0027d end his life as soon as he could lay hands on his sword -- might be granted a last request, such as even he used to grant his nightly victims in the morning, his would be to teach his fair executioner the joys of sex before she unsexed him. \"Nonsense,\" Dunyazade said crossly. \"I\u0027ve seen all that.\" \"Seeing\u0027s not feeling.\" She glared at him. \"I\u0027ll learn when I choose, then, from a less bloody teacher: someone I love, no matter how foolishly.\" She turned her head. \"If I ever meet such a man. Which I won\u0027t.\" Vexed, she slipped into her gown, holding the razor awkwardly in her left hand while she fastened the hooks. \"What a lucky fellow! You don\u0027t love me then, little wife?\" \"Of course not! I\u0027ll admit you\u0027re not the monster I\u0027d imagined -- in appearance, I mean. But you\u0027re a total stranger to me, and the thought of what you did to all those girls makes me retch. Don\u0027t waste your last words in silly flirting; you won\u0027t change my mind. You\u0027d do better to prepare yourself to die.\" \"I\u0027m quite prepared, Dunyazade,\" Shah Zaman replied calmly. \"I have been from the beginning. Why else do you suppose I haven\u0027t called my guards in to kill you? I\u0027m sure my brother\u0027s long since done for Scheherazade, if she really tried to do what she put you up to doing. Shahryar and I would have been great fools not to anticipate this sort of thing from the very first night, six years ago.\" \"I don\u0027t believe you.\" The King shrugged his eyebrows and whistled through his teeth; two husky mamelukes stepped at once from behind a tapestry depicting Jamshid\u0027s seven-ringed cup, seized Dunyazade by the wrists, covered her mouth, and took the open razor from her hand. \"Fair or not,\" Shah Zaman said conversationally as she struggled, \"your only power at present is what I choose to give you. And fair or not, I choose to give it.\" He smiled. \"Let her have the razor, my friends, and take the rest of the night off. If you don\u0027t believe that I deliberately put myself in your hands from the first, Dunyazade, you can\u0027t deny I\u0027m doing so now. All I ask is leave to tell you a story, in exchange for the one you\u0027ve told me; when I\u0027m finished you may do as you please.\" The mamelukes reluctantly let her go, but left the room only when Shah Zaman, still stripped and bound, repeated his order. Dunyazade sat exhausted on a hassock, rubbed her wrists, pinned up her fallen hair, drew the gown more closely about her. \"I\u0027m not impressed,\" she said. \"If I pick up the razor, they\u0027ll put an arrow through me.\" \"That hadn\u0027t occurred to me,\" Shah Zaman admitted. \"You\u0027ll have to trust me a little, then, as I\u0027m trusting you. Do pick it up. I insist.\" \"You insist!\" Dunyazade said bitterly. She took up the razor, let her hand fall passively beside the hassock, began to weep. \"Let\u0027s see, now,\" mused the King. \"How can we give you the absolute advantage? They\u0027re very fast, those guards, and loyal; if they really are standing by, what I fear is that they\u0027ll misconstrue some innocent movement of yours and shoot.\" \"What difference does it make?\" Dunyazade said miserably. \"Poor Sherry!\" \"I have it! Come sit here beside me. Please, do as I say! Now lay that razor\u0027s edge exactly where you were going to put it before; then you can make your move before any marksman can draw and release. You\u0027ll have to hold me in your other hand; I\u0027ve gone limp with alarm.\" Dunyazade wept. \"Come,\" the King insisted: \"it\u0027s the only way you\u0027ll be convinced I\u0027m serious. No, I mean right up against it, so that you could do your trick in half a second. Whew, that gooseflesh isn\u0027t faked! What a situation! Now look here: even this advantage gripes you, I suppose, since it was given instead of taken: the male still leading the female, et cetera. No help for that just now. Besides, between any two people, you know -- what I mean, it\u0027s not the patriarchy that makes you take the passive role with your sister, for example. Never mind that. See me sweat! Now, then: I agree with that Genie of yours in the matter of priorities, and I entreat you not only to permit me to tell you a story, but to make love with me first.\" Dunyazade shut her eyes and whipped her head from side to side. \"As you wish,\" said the King. \"I\u0027d never force you, as you\u0027ll understand if you\u0027ll hear my story. Shall I tell it?\" Dunyazade moved her head indifferently. \"More tightly. Careful with that razor!\" \"Can\u0027t you make it go down?\" the girl asked thickly. \"It\u0027s obscene. And distracting. I think I\u0027m going to be sick.\" \"Not more distracting than your little breasts, or your little fingers. . . No, please, I insist you keep hold of your advantage! My story\u0027s short, I promise, and I\u0027m at your mercy. So: \"Six years ago I thought myself the happiest man alive. I\u0027d had a royal childhood; my college years were a joy; my career had gone brilliantly; at twenty-five I ruled a kingdom almost as prosperous as Shahryar\u0027s at forty. I was popular with my subjects; I kept the government reasonably honest, the various power groups reasonably in hand, et cetera. Like every king I kept a harem of concubines for the sake of my public image, but as a rule they were reserved for state visitors. For myself I wanted nobody except my bride, never mind her name, whom after a whole year of marriage I still loved more than any woman I\u0027d ever known. After a day\u0027s work in the durbar, bidding and forbidding et cetera, I\u0027d rush in to dinner, and we\u0027d play all night like two kittens in a basket. No trick of love we didn\u0027t turn together; no myth of gods and nymphs we didn\u0027t mimic. The harem girls, when I used them, only reminded me of how much I preferred my wife; often as not I\u0027d dismiss them in mid-clip and call her in for the finish. \"When my brother summoned me here to visit that first time, much as I longed to see him it was all I could do to leave my bride behind; we made our first goodbyes; then I was as overjoyed as I imagined she\u0027d be when I discovered that I\u0027d forgotten a diamond necklace I\u0027d meant to present to Shahryar\u0027s queen. I rushed back to the palace myself instead of sending after it, so that we could make love once again before I left -- and I found her in our bed, riding astride the chief cook! Her last words were \u0027Next time invite me\u0027; I cut them both in two, four halves in all, not to seem a wittol; came here and found my sister-in-law cuckolding my brother with the blackamoor Sa\u0027ad al-Din Saood, who swung from trees, slavered and gibbered, and sported a yard that made mine look like your little finger. Kings no more, Shahryar and I left together by the postern gate, resolved to kill ourselves as the most wretched fools on earth if our misery was particular. One day as we were wandering in the marshes, far from the paths of men, devouring our own souls, we saw what we thought was a waterspout coming up the bay, and climbed a loblolly pine for safety. It turned out to be that famous ifrit of your sister\u0027s story: he took the steel coffer out of his casket, unlocked the seven locks with seven keys, fetched out and futtered the girl he\u0027d stolen on her wedding night, and fell asleep in her lap; she signaled us to come down and ordered us both to cuckold the ifrit with her then and there. Who says a man can\u0027t be forced? We did our best, and she added our seal rings to the five hundred seventy she\u0027d already collected. We understood then that no woman on earth who wants a rogering will go unrogered, though she be sealed up in a tower of brass. \"So. When I\u0027d first told my brother of my own cuckolding, he\u0027d vowed that in my position he\u0027d not have rested till he\u0027d killed a thousand women: now we went back to his palace; he put to death his queen and all his concubines and their lovers, and we took a solemn oath to rape and kill a virgin a night, so as never again to be deceived. I came home to Samarkand, wondering at the turns of our despair: how a private apocalypse can infect the state and bring about one more general, et cetera. With this latter motive, more than for revenge on womankind, I resolved to hold to our dreadful policy until my kingdom fell to ruin or an outraged populace rose up and slew me. \"But unlike Shahryar, I said nothing at first to my vizier, only told him to fetch me a beautiful virgin for the night. Not knowing that I meant to kill her in the morning, he brought me his own daughter, a girl I knew well and had long admired, Samarkand\u0027s equivalent of Scheherazade. I assumed he was pandering to his own advancement, and smiled at the thought of putting them to death together; I soon learned, however, from the woman herself, that it was her own idea to come to me -- and her motive, unlike your sister\u0027s, was simple love. I undressed and fell to toying with her; she wept; I asked what ailed her: it was not being separated from her sister, but being alone at last with me, the fulfillment of her lifelong dream. I found myself much touched by this and, to my surprise, impotent. Stalling for time, I remarked that such dreams could turn out to be nightmares. She embraced me timidly and replied that she deplored my murdering my wife and her paramour, both of whom she\u0027d known and rather liked, for though in a general way she sympathized with my disenchanted outrage, she believed she understood as well my wife\u0027s motives for cuckolding me, which in her view were not all that different, essentially, from the ifrit\u0027s maiden\u0027s in the story. Despite my anger, she went on bravely to declare that she herself took what she called the Tragic View of Sex and Temperament: to wit, that while perfect equality between men and women was the only defensible value in that line, she was not at all certain it was attainable; even to pursue it ardently, against the grain of things as they were, was in all likelihood to spoil one\u0027s chances for happiness in love; not to pursue it, on the other hand, once one had seen it clearly to be the ideal, no doubt had the same effect. For herself, though she deplored injustice whether in individuals or in institutions, and gently affirmed equality as the goal that lovers lovingly should strive for, however short of it their histories and temperaments made them fall, yet she knew herself personally to be unsuited for independence, formed by her nature and upbringing to be happy only in the shadow of a man whom she admired and respected more than herself. She was anything but blind to my faults and my own blindness to them, she declared, but so adored me withal that if I could love her even for a night she\u0027d think her life complete, and wish nothing further unless maybe a little Shah Zaman to devote the rest of her years to raising. Or if my disillusionment with women were so extreme (as she seemed uncannily to guess from my expression) that I had brought her to my bed not to marry her or even add her to my harem, but merely to take her virginity and her life, I was welcome to both; she only prayed I might be gentle in their taking. \"This last remark dismayed me the more because it echoed something my late wife had said on our wedding night: that even death at my hands would be sweeter to her than life at another\u0027s. How I despised, resented, missed her! As if it were I who was cut in two, I longed to hold her as in nights gone by, yet would have halved her bloody halves if she\u0027d been restored to me. There lay my new woman on the bed, naked and still now; I stood on my knees between hers, weeping so for her predecessor\u0027s beauty and deceit, my own blindness and cruelty -- and the wretched state of affairs between man and womankind that made love a will-o\u0027-the-wisp, jealousy and boredom and resentment the rule -- that I could neither function nor dissemble. I told her of all that had taken place between my departure from Samarkand and my return, the oath I\u0027d sworn with my brother, and my resolve to keep it lest I seem chicken-hearted and a fool. \" \u0027Lest you seem!\u0027 the girl cried out. \u0027Harems, homicides -- everything for the sake of seeming!\u0027 She commanded me then, full of irony for all her fears, to keep my vow if I meant to keep it, or else cut out her tongue before I cut off her head; for if I sent her to the block without deflowering her first, she would declare to any present, even if only her executioner, that I was a man in seeming merely, not in fact, and offer her maidenhood as proof. Her courage astonished me as much as her words. \u0027By Allah,\u0027 I vowed to her, \u0027I won\u0027t kill you if I can\u0027t get it up for you first.\u0027 But that miserable fellow in your left hand, which had never once failed me before, and which stands up now like an idiot soldier in enemy country, as if eager to be cut down, deserted me utterly. I tried every trick I knew, in vain, though my victim willingly complied with my instructions. I could of course have killed her myself, then and there, but I had no wish to seem a hypocrite even for a moment in her eyes; nor, for that matter, to let her die a virgin -- nor, I admitted finally to myself, to let her die at all before she was overtaken like the rest of us by the Destroyer of Delights et cetera. For seven nights we tossed and tumbled, fondled and kissed and played, she reaching such heats of unaccustomed joy as to cry out, no longer sarcastically, that if only I would stick her first with my carnal sword, she\u0027d bare her neck without complaint to my steel. On the seventh night, as we lay panting in a sweat of frustration, I gave her my dagger and invited her to do me and Samarkand the kindness of killing me at once, for I\u0027d rather die than seem unable to keep my vow. \" \u0027You are unable to keep it,\u0027 she told me softly: \u0027not because you\u0027re naturally impotent, but because you\u0027re not naturally cruel. If you\u0027d tell your brother that after thinking it over you\u0027ve simply come to a conclusion different from his, you\u0027d be cured as if by magic.\u0027 And in fact, as if by magic indeed, what she said was so true that at her very words the weight was lifted from heart and tool together; they rose as one. Gratefully, tenderly, I went into her at last; we cried for joy, came at once, fell asleep in each other\u0027s arms. \"No question after that of following Shahryar\u0027s lead; on the other hand, I found myself in the morning not yet man enough after all to send word to him of my change of heart and urge him to change his. Neither was I, after all, in love enough with the Vizier\u0027s daughter to risk again the estate of marriage, which she herself considered problematical at best. \" \u0027I never expected you to marry me,\u0027 she told me when I told her these things, \u0027though I\u0027d be dishonest if I didn\u0027t say I dreamed and prayed you might. All I ever really hoped for was a love affair with you, and a baby to remember it by. Even if I don\u0027t have the baby, I\u0027ve had the affair: you truly loved me last night.\u0027 \"I did, and for many nights after -- but not enough to make the final step. What your Genie said concerning marriage could have come from my own mouth if I had the gift of words: to anyone of moral imagination who\u0027s known it, no other relation between men and women has true seriousness; yet that same imagination kept me from it. And I dreaded the day my brother would get word of my weakness. I grew glum and cross; my mistress, intuitive as ever, guessed the reason at once. \u0027You can neither keep your vow nor break it,\u0027 she told me: \u0027Perhaps you\u0027d better do both for a while, till you find your way.\u0027 I asked her how such a contradiction was possible. \u0027By the magic words as if,\u0027 she replied, \u0027which, to a person satisfied with seeming, are more potent than all the genii in the tales.\u0027 \"She then set forth a remarkable proposal: legend had it that far to the west of Samarkand was a country peopled entirely with women, adjoining another wholly male: for two months every spring they mated freely with each other on neutral ground, the women returning home as they found themselves pregnant, giving their male children to the neighboring tribe and raising the girls as members of their own. Whether or not such a community in fact existed, she thought it a desirable alternative to the present state of affairs, and unquestionably preferable to death; since I couldn\u0027t treasure her as she treasured me (and not for a moment did she blame me for that incapacity), she proposed to establish such an alternative society herself, with my assistance. I was to proclaim my brother\u0027s policy as my own, take to bed a virgin every night and declare her executed in the morning; but instead of actually raping and killing them I would tell them of her alternative society and send them secretly from Samarkand, in groups of a hundred or so, to organize and populate it. If, knowing their destiny, they chose to spend their last night in Samarkand making love with me, that was their affair; none, she imagined, would choose death over emigration, and any who found their new way of life not to their liking could return to Samarkand if and when I changed my policy, or migrate elsewhere in the meanwhile. In any case they\u0027d be alive and free; or, if the pioneers were captured and made slaves of by barbarians before the new society was established, they\u0027d be no worse off than the millions of their sisters already in that condition. On the other hand, separate societies of men and women, mingling freely at their own wills as equals on neutral ground, might just make possible a true society of the future in which the separation was no longer necessary. And in the meantime, of course, for better or worse, it would be as if I\u0027d kept my dreadful vow. \"At first hearing, the plan struck me as absurd; after a few nights it seemed less so, perhaps even feasible; by the end of a week of examining passionately with her all the alternatives, it seemed no less unreasonable than they. My angel herself, in keeping with her Tragic View, didn\u0027t expect the new society to work in the na?ve sense: what human institutions ever did? It would have the vices of its virtues; if not nipped in the bud by marauding rapists, it would grow and change and rigidify in forms and values quite different from its founders\u0027 -- codifying, institutionalizing, and perverting its original spirit. No help for that. \"Was there ever such a woman? I kissed her respectfully, then ardently a final time. After one last love-making in the morning, while my hand lingered on her left breast, she declared calmly her intention, upon arriving at her virgin kingdom, to amputate that same breast for symbolic reasons and urge her companions to do the same, as a kind of initiation rite. \u0027We\u0027ll make up a practical excuse for it,\u0027 she said: \u0027 \"The better to draw our bows,\" et cetera. But the real point will be that in one aspect we\u0027re all woman, in another all warrior. Maybe we\u0027ll call ourselves The Breastless Ones.\u0027 \" \u0027That seems extreme,\u0027 I remarked. She replied that a certain extremism was necessary to the survival of anything radically innovative. Later generations, she assumed, established and effete, would find the ancestral custom barbaric and honor its symbolism, if at all, with a correspondingly symbolic mammectomy-- a decorative scar, perhaps, or cosmetic mark. No matter; everything passed. \"So did our connection: with a thousand thanks to her for opening my eyes, a thousand good wishes for the success of her daring enterprise, and many thousands of dinars to support it (which for portability and security she converted into a phial of diamonds and carried intravaginally), I declared her dead, let her father the Vizier in on our secret, and sent her off secretly to one of my country castles on a distant lake, where she prepared for the expedition westward while her companions, the ostensible victims of my new policy, accumulated about her. Perhaps a third, apprised of their fate, chose to remain virginal, whether indignantly, ruefully, or gratefully; on the other two-thirds who in whatever spirit elected to go hymenless to the new society, I bestowed similar phials of jewels. Somewhat less than fifty percent of this number found themselves impregnated by our night together, and so when the first detachment of two hundred pioneers set out across the western wastes, their actual number was about two hundred sixty. Since I pursued this policy for nearly two thousand nights, the number of pilgrims and unborn children sent west from Samarkand must have totaled about twenty-six hundred; corrected for a normal male birth rate of somewhat over fifty per cent, a rather higher than normal rate of spontaneous abortion, and infant as well as maternal mortality owing to the rigors of traveling and of settling a new territory, and ignoring -- as one must to retain one\u0027s reason -- the possibility of mass enslavement, rape, massacre, or natural catastrophe, the number of pioneers to the Country of the Breastless must be at least equal to the number of nights until Shahryar\u0027s message concerning your sister arrived from the Islands of India and China. \"Of the success or failure of those founding mothers I know nothing; kept myself ignorant deliberately, lest I learn that I was sending them after all to the Destroyer of Delights and Severer of Societies. The folk of Samarkand never rose against me; nor did my vizier, like Shahryar\u0027s, have difficulty enlisting sacrificial virgins; even at the end, though my official toll was twice my brother\u0027s, about half the girls were volunteers-- from all which, I infer that their actual fate was an open secret. For all I know, my original mistress never truly intended to found her gynocracy; the whole proposal was perhaps a ruse; perhaps they all slipped back into the country with their phials of gems for dowry, married and lived openly under my nose. No matter: night after night I brought them to bed, set forth their options, then either glumly stripped and pronged them or spent the night in chaste sleep and conversation. Tall and short, dark and fair, lean and plump, cold and ardent, bold and timid, clever and stupid, comely and plain-- I bedded them all, spoke with them all, possessed them all, but was myself possessed by nothing but despair. Though I took many, with their consent, I wanted none of them. Novelty lost its charm, then even its novelty. Unfamiliarity I came to loathe: the foreign body in the dark, the alien touch and voice, the endless exposition. All I craved was someone with whom to get on with the story of my life, which was to say, of our life together: a loving friend; a loving wife; a treasurable wife; a wife, a wife. \"My brother\u0027s second message, when it came, seemed a miraculous reprise of that fatal first, six years before: I turned the kingdom over to my vizier and set out at once, resolved to meet this Scheherazade who had so wooed and yarned him back to the ways of life that he meant to wed her. \u0027Perhaps she has a younger sister,\u0027 I said to myself; if she does, I\u0027ll make no inquiries, demand no stories, set no conditions, but humbly put my life in her hands, tell her the whole tale of the two thousand and two nights that led me to her, and bid her end that story as she will -- whether with the last goodnight of all or (what I can just dimly envision, like dawn in another world) some clear and fine and fresh good morning.\" Dunyazade yawned and shivered. \"I can\u0027t imagine what you\u0027re talking about. Am I expected to believe that preposterous business of Breastless Pilgrims and Tragic Views?\" \"Yes!\" cried Shah Zaman, then let his head fall back to the pillow. \"They\u0027re too important to be lies. Fictions, maybe -- but truer than fact.\" Dunyazade covered her eyes with her razor-hand. \"What do you expect me to do? Forgive you? Love you?\" \"Yes!\" the King cried again, his eyes flashing. \"Let\u0027s end the dark night! All that passion and hate between men and women; all that confusion of inequality and difference! Let\u0027s take the truly tragic view of love! Maybe it is a fiction, but it\u0027s the profoundest and best of all! Treasure me, Dunyazade, as I\u0027ll treasure you!\" \"For pity\u0027s sake stop!\" But Shah Zaman urged ardently: \"Let\u0027s embrace; let\u0027s forbear; let\u0027s love as long as we can, Dunyazade -- then embrace again, forebear and love again!\" \"It won\u0027t work.\" \"Nothing works! But the enterprise is noble; it\u0027s full of joy and life, and the other ways are deathy. Let\u0027s make love like passionate equals!\" \"You mean as if we were equals,\" Dunyazade said. \"You know we\u0027re not. What you want is impossible.\" \"Despite your heart\u0027s feelings?\" pressed the King. \"Let it be as if! Let\u0027s make a philosophy of that as if!\" Dunyazade wailed: \"I want my sister!\" \"She may be alive; my brother, too.\" More quietly, Shah Zaman explained that Shahryar had been made acquainted with his brother\u0027s recent history and opinions, and had vowed that should Scheherazade ever attempt his life, he\u0027d manage himself somewhat similarly: that is (as he was twenty years older, and more conservative), not exactly granting his wife the power to kill him, but disarming and declining to kill her, and within the bounds of good public relations, permitting her a freedom comparable to his own. The harem was a royal tradition, necessarily public; Scheherazade could take what lovers she would, but of necessity in private. Et cetera. \"Did you really imagine your sister fooled Shahryar for a thousand nights with her mamelukes and dildoes?\" Shah Zaman laughed. \"A man couldn\u0027t stay king very long if he didn\u0027t even know what was going on in the harem! And why do you suppose he permitted it, if not that he loved her too much, and was too sick of his other policy, to kill her? She changed his mind, all right, but she never fooled him: he used to believe that all women were unfaithful, and that the only way to spare himself the pain of infidelity was to deflower and kill them; now he believes that all people are unfaithful, and that the way to spare oneself the pain of infidelity is to love and not to care. He chooses equal promiscuity; I choose equal fidelity. Let\u0027s treasure each other, Dunyazade!\" She shook her head angrily, or desperately. \"It\u0027s absurd. You\u0027re only trying to talk your way out of a bad spot.\" \"Of course I am! And of course it\u0027s absurd! Treasure me!\" \"I\u0027m exhausted. I should use the razor on both of us, and be done with it.\" \"Treasure me, Dunyazade!\" \"We\u0027ve talked all night; I hear the cocks; it\u0027s getting light.\" \"Good morning, then! Good morning!\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/349/219.html","bookId":312,"book":{"id":312,"title":"蓝色紫罗兰 Violets Are Blue","description":"简介： Back Page: At this point I interrupted my sister as usual to say, You have a way with words, Scheherazade.
