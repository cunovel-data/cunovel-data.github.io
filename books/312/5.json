{"id":36575,"no":5,"title":"Chapter 5","content":"\"Good night.\"\\n\\n \"Good night.\"\\n\\n Some stories last longer than others. Now my wife\u0027s feelings were hurt, Philono?\u0027s, and no wonder: for the occasion she\u0027s made ambrosia with her own hands, dismissed the servants early, donned her best nightie; it should have been one dessert after another. But Bellerophon, King of Lycia, at sundown on the eve of his birthday found floating in the marsh near his palace a Greek novella called Perseid, story of his model hero; by the time he got to its last words he was forty and too tired.\\n\\n Thus begins, so help me Muse, the tidewater tale of twin Bellerophon, mythic hero, cousin to constellated Perseus: how he flew and reflew Pegasus the winged horse; dealt double death to the three-part freak Chimera; twice loved, twice lost; twice aspired to, reached, and died to immortality -- in short, how he rode the heroic cycle and was recycled. Loosed at last from mortal speech, he turned into written words: Bellerophonic letters afloat between two worlds, forever betraying, in combinations and recombinations, the man they forever represent.\\n\\n \"You never criticize,\" I go on to carp shortly at the bedroom ceiling, dark. \"There\u0027s something wrong with a woman who never criticizes.\"\\n\\n After a moment, pensive Philono? beside me said: \"Sometimes I criticize.\"\\n\\n \"No you don\u0027t. You\u0027re perfect; that\u0027s your trouble.\"\\n\\n \"My feelings are hurt, yes,\" Philono? is represented here as having explained. \"But there\u0027s no point in criticizing a person when he\u0027s obviously upset. Though why you\u0027re upset, I can\u0027t imagine.\"\\n\\n \"Upset upset. My life\u0027s a failure. I\u0027m not a mythic hero. I never will be.\"\\n\\n \"You are!\" Their dialogue conveys the general sense of our conversation, but neither establishes Philono?\u0027s indomitable gentleness of spirit and body and her husband\u0027s punishing self-concern, nor achieves in proportion to its length enough simple exposition. Had I understood, when I consented at the end of this novella to be transformed by the seer Polyeidus into a version of Bellerophon\u0027s life, that I might be imperfectly, even ineptly narrated, I\u0027d have cleaved to my original program: to fall from heaven into a thornbush, become a blind lame vatic figure, and float upon the marshy tide, reciting my history aloud, in my own voice, to Melanippe the Amazon -- my moon, my muse, my final mortal love -- as she ebbed and flooded me. And if Polyeidus the Seer had realized that this final and trickiest effort in the literary-metamorphosis way would be freckled and soiled with as it were self-criticism, he\u0027d\u0027ve let Bellerophon smack into the muck and bubble there forever, like Dante\u0027s Wrathful in the marshes of the Styx. Fenny father, old shape-shifter: here you are, then; even here. On with the story.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s perfectly obvious,\" Philono? went on, her voice as gentle as her gentle body, whose beauty five-and-thirty years had scarcely scarred, \"that Athene\u0027s still on your side. The Kingdom of Lycia is reasonably prosperous and politically stable despite our vexing military involvement with the Carians and their new alliance with the Solymians and Amazons. Our children are growing up satisfactorily, take it all in all -- not like Proetus and Anteia\u0027s wayward daughters. Your fame as a Chimeromach seems secure, judging by your fan mail; even the Perseid, I gather from the excerpts you chose to read me, mentions you favorably a couple of times. Finally, our marriage (which, remember, is to me what your career as mythic hero is to you: my cardinal value and vindication, my raison d\u0027Ãªtre) is, if no longer fiery as Chimera\u0027s breath, affectionate, comfortable, and sexually steady, in the main. Certainly we\u0027ve been spared the resentments that poisoned Perseus and Andromeda\u0027s relationship as they reached our age, and while we cannot be called innocent, surely we are rather experienced than guilty.\\n\\n \"Now, it may very well be that your most spectacular work is behind you -- I\u0027ve yet to read the Perseid, but what mythic hero isn\u0027t over the hill, as it were, by the time he\u0027s forty? However, it strikes me as at least likely that your best work may not be your most spectacular, and that it may lie ahead, if not be actually in progress: I mean the orderly administration of your country, your family, and yourself over the long haul; the patient cultivation of understanding into wisdom; the accumulation of rich experience and its recycling in the form of enlightened policy, foreign, domestic, and personal -- all those things, in brief, which make a man not merely celebrated, but great; not merely admired, but loved; et cetera.\"\\n\\n I compare to this the rich prose of the Perseid and despair. Sleep with its author, then, if Melanippe\u0027s style won\u0027t do! No, no, my love, it\u0027s not your style; you merely set the words down as they come, or long since came: once-living creatures caught and fossiled in the clay; bones displaced by alien mineral, grown with crystals, hued with the oxides of old corrosion, heaved and worn and rearranged by the eons\u0027 ebb; shards; disjecta membra, from which the sleeping dragon is ever harder to infer. You said it. Anyhow I slept, and woke unhappy as before. As always, Philono? ungrudgingly forgave -- Melanippe is no Philono?. I didn\u0027t mean to imply that she is -- aroused and made love to me, then permitted me a post-coital nap while she prepared with her own hands a birthday breakfast: spinach pie and feta cheese. With this woman, Polyeidus wonders, the man was unhappy? He shouldn\u0027t wonder, Bellerophon believes (echoing for a moment, if lamely, the prancing rhythms and alliterations of the Perseid), as it was he showed Bellerus as a boy the Pattern of Mythic Heroism, fourth quadrant of which calls for the mature hero\u0027s sudden and mysterious fall from the favor of gods and men; his departure, voluntary or otherwise, from the city of his own establishment; his mysterious apotheosis on a hilltop, symbolic counterpart of the place of his divine conception; et cetera.\\n\\n Bellerophon is telling Polyeidus this? Whomever the buskin fits: Melanippe, too, perky priestess of his passions, shouldn\u0027t need reminding how the undauntable docility of the lady here featured as Philono?, her absolute solicitude, her angelic, her invulnerable devotion -- this is nauseating two-thirds of us -- had long since made Bellerophon half-desperate, most particularly for the reason least appreciated by Philono? herself in her reference to Andromeda, above. In a word, I was inescapably content -- in my marriage, my children, my royal career -- and because mythic heroes at that age and stage should become the opposite of content, my contentment made me wretched.\\n\\n Pause. Melanippe the Amazon, let\u0027s say, is not at all sure she comprehends this sophistry. You were unhappy because you were happy?\\n\\n The sophistry may be insufferable: the suffering was real. There was Perseus, risen from his misery and shining in the sky; here was Bellerophon, miserably content, holding his story in his hand.\\n\\n For this you left your wife and family?\\n\\n And my kingdom. And my empire. That\u0027s where my story starts, when I go wandering in the Ale?an marsh, \"far from the paths of men, devouring my own soul,\" et cetera.\\n\\n Wait while I write that plain: wretched because nothing was wrong.\\n\\n Right.\\n\\n Pause. It has been remarked that this state of spiritual affairs -- the general malaise, I mean, not the specific etiology -- is figured commonly in the myths by an objective correlative: one thinks of the miasma that hangs over Oedipus\u0027s Thebes, or Perseus\u0027s imagined petrifaction. Was there anything similar in Bellerophon\u0027s case?\\n\\n I wonder how many voices are telling my tale. It seems to me that upon my first being transformed into the story of my life, at best a sorely qualified immortality, the narrative voice was clear and objective: in simple, disciplined prose it recounted my middle-aged distress, figured conveniently by Pegasus\u0027s inability to fly, voila. Briefly it rehearsed my vain attempts to foment rebellion in my children over the question of which should succeed me to the Lycian throne; exasperation in my wife by endless repetitions of the tale of my youthful exploits, including my affair with her older sister Anteia; sedition in my subjects by continuing and escalating the unpopular Solymian war -- my children were filially pious, my wife adored me, the silent majority of Lycians supported my administration. Beginning in the middle, on the eve of my fortieth birthday, this original or best Bellerophoniad proceeded with unostentatious skill to carry forward the present-time drama (my quest for literal immortality) while completing the plenteous exposition of my earlier adventures -- a narrative difficulty resolved by the simple but inspired device of making the second half of my life recapitulate ironically the first, after the manner of the Perseid, but with the number five (i.e., threes and twos) rather than seven as the numerical basis of the structure, and a circle rather than a logarithmic spiral as its geometric motif. It commenced, moreover, with an echo not only of Perseid\u0027s opening lines but of its dramatic construction as well: that is, not at the beginning of the hero\u0027s second series of adventures (Perseus\u0027s departure with cross Andromeda to revisit the scenes of his youthful triumphs in search of rejuvenation; cross Bellerophon\u0027s ditto with patient Philono? in search of the magic herb hippomanes), but at their mid-point: Perseus, while always ultimately addressing the reader from heaven, tells most of his story immediately to his mistress Calyxa in Egypt; Bellerophon, it seems to me, while always ultimately addressing the reader from pages floating in the marshes of what has become Dorchester County, Maryland, U.S.A., used to begin by rehearsing his prior history to pretty Melanippe in the marshes of the river Thermodon, near Scythian Themiscyra. The narration was repeated daily and lasted all day: two tideslengths, to be exact, corresponding to the halves of my life and work. The First Flood, so to speak, covered my adventures from the death of my father and my brother, through the killing of the Chimera, to my marriage to Princess Philono? -- roughly from my nineteenth through my twenty-seventh year; the First Ebb discovered my reign in Lycia and the establishment of my family, through my growing discontentment with my contentment, to Pegasus\u0027s inability to get off the ground, twenty-eighth through thirty-sixth year; the Second Flood covered my adventures from the time of my leaving Lycia to consult the Old Man of the Marsh (actually the prophet Polyeidus), through my travels in search of the horsenip herb hippomanes, to my idyll with Amazonian Melanippe, thirty-seventh through forty-fifth year; the Second Ebb discovered my attempted flight to Olympus, through my long free-fall from Pegasus, to the end of my chronological life, forty-sixth through fifty-fourth year. The thirty-six-year period, divided into eighteen-year cycles and nine-year quarters, was a compromise as I remember between the Polyeidic \"solar\" life-calendar, a seventy-two-year span based on a three-hundred-sixty-day year of twelve thirty-day months, and the Melanippic or Amazonian \"lunar\" life-calendar, based on four quarters of approximately fourteen years each (though Amazons do not acknowledge annual units), metaphorically correspondent to the phases of the moon and the four stages of female sexuality (birth to puberty, puberty to sexual maturity, sexual maturity to menopause, menopause to death-- the life expectancy of Amazons, reckoned in Polyeidic terms, is fifty-six \"years\"; they begin menstruating at age \"fourteen,\" on the average, and cease about age \"forty-two\"). It was, finally, a distinguishing feature of this ideal Bellerophoniad that while the length and periodicity of the narration were constant, the amplitude of the narrative varied like the range of the tides with the narrator\u0027s energy, itself a function of his concentration or distraction. Yes, yes, the tale was told to its fullest heights and depths twice per lunar month, when the pulls so to speak of Polyeidus and Melanippe were perfectly aligned; at the summer-solstitial full moon in particular, I recollect, my tale achieved a pitch of eloquence-- a phenomenon no doubt to be accounted for by the latitude and longitude of tidewater Maryland. Contrariwise, twice each month the narration was unusually flat and shallow, especially in the neighborhood of the equinoxes -- and distracted, as though the pure Bellerophonic voice were tugged and co-opted now by Polyeidus this way, now Melanippe that; not to the end of dramatic harmony and tension, but discordantly, to stalemate and stagnation.\\n\\n In posing the question, I now observe, I or someone has answered if. Full knowledge of the five tidal \"constants\" (geographic location, mean water-depth, configuration of shoreline, speed of Earth-rotation, friction of sea-bottom), the four periodic variables (relative positions of Sun and Moon to each other and to Earth, their respective distances from Earth, inclination of the lunar orbit to the Equator), and the three non-periodic variables (wind force, wind direction, barometric pressure) would doubtless afford a complete understanding of Bellerophoniad\u0027s narrative processes -- but such comprehension, difficult to acquire, is impossible to crave. All I sense is the current neapness! If Bellerophon might rebegin, unclogged, unsilted! Time and tide, however, et cetera.\\n\\n For God\u0027s sake, Melanippe, put this down: The winged horse won\u0027t fly! Would not, wouldn\u0027t! Vehicle of my glory, from whose high back I bombed Solymian and Amazon alike, in better days, from Bronze Age back to Stone, sank the Carian pirates, did to death the unimaginable Chimera -- Pegasus can\u0027t get off the ground! Could not, couldn\u0027t! Turned out to pasture since his master\u0027s marriage, fat and tame now, my sweet half-brother in time grew loath even to lift his moonshaped hooves, much less strike well-springs with them for the Muses. Twenty years it had been my custom every morning, after breakfast, to take down from its place of honor over my throne the golden Bridle of Restraint, Athene\u0027s gift (Perseid reliefs, Series II, Panel 3), without which none can mount the steed sired by Poseidon on Medusa and foaled when Perseus beheaded her. My wife I\u0027d perch athwart my pommel, and we\u0027d make a high circuit of the empire, cheered by all we overlooked. Now, the Perseid under my belt, I burped to the paddock and was by the lackeys boosted into place; applied the heel, laid on the crop; clucked and chucked and urged and whistled: the beast no longer giddyapped, much less went vaulting starward; only grazed in circles, trailing horsefeathers where his wings like doused sails dragged by the board.\\n\\n This Perseid is that heavy? No, no, love, it\u0027s I was heavy, drag-hoofed as this telling of my tale. Perseid takes off like its hero. Hum. Did Bellerophon\u0027s grounding happen all at once or gradually, over the years of his marriage? You know the story. I wish I were dead.\\n\\n Melanippe, as she is here called, being an Amazon, is not conversant with the niceties either of marriage or of narrative construction. In her position as Bellerophon\u0027s lover and alleged chronicler, however, she makes the following suggestion: the \"present\" action of this part of the story (you used the term \"First Ebb,\" I believe), must cover your attempts to deteriorate three separate relations-- with your late children, your late wife, and your late subjects -- and at the same time accomplish, at least in a preliminary way, as much as possible of the earlier, \"First Flood\" exposition: the story of your former life. Then why not attempt to alienate your children with anecdotes of your own childhood, your wife with the Anteia episode, the citizenry with boring accounts of your later adventures? Isn\u0027t that the way you said it\u0027s done in the mythical \"ideal\" Bellerophoniad? Correlate these internal narratives and Pegasus\u0027s descending altitude, with an eye to ending the First Flood at the \"climax\" of the First Ebb: i.e., the morning you couldn\u0027t get Peg up at all and struck out for the swamp. At the same time, since First Flood, First Ebb, and Second Flood themselves comprise an internal narrative framed by our affair here on the Thermodon, punctuate them wherever convenient with conversation between Bellerophon and Melanippe, \"giving if possible a degree of dramatic development to our tidewater idyll. That is, unless drama and development on the one hand, idyll and immortality on the other, are not irreconcilable sets of notions. What do you think?\\n\\n I think I\u0027m dead. I think I\u0027m spooked. I\u0027m full of voices, all mine, none me; I can\u0027t keep straight who\u0027s speaking, as I used to. It\u0027s not my wish to be obscure or difficult; I\u0027d hoped at least to entertain, if not inspire. But put it that one has had visions of an order complex unto madness: Now and again, like mazy marshways glimpsed from Pegasus at top-flight, the design is clear: one sees how the waters flow and why; what freight they bear and whither. Between, one\u0027s swamped; the craft goes on, but its way seems arbitrary, seems insane.\\n\\n There, love: you flew. With Philono? and the children?\\n\\n Yes, yes. Yes, yes, yes. From the time our first was born he flew too, nestled in his mother\u0027s breast as she in mine, and so loved the ride that to my discomfort she named him Hippolochus: \"dropped from a mare.\" Soon little Isander took his place; sturdy Hippolochus hung on astern. Came Laodamia, gentle as her mom: the ladies rode before, the boys behind, never once squabbling which should sit next after me, and the royal family daily went sky-high.\\n\\n But not.\\n\\n But not so high as formerly, or far, or fast. For this Philono? thanked me on the children\u0027s behalf and hers, thinking I reined us in on their account; at the same time she grounded herself thenceforward, lest the late infrequency of our flights beyond the Lycian border be a cause of the rumored new alliance between the Carians and Solymians, our ancient enemies. But even without her, though his range and altitude increased, Pegasus never quite regained his former heights; as the children grew, we found ourselves down again to the olive-tops. Not to buzz and turd my subjects into disaffection, I bumped in turn Hippolochus, Isander, and Laodamia, each time reclimbing to a lower peak, like waves on a foreshore as the tide runs out. I watched the new constellations wheel far over my head -- Perseus, Medusa, Andromeda, Cepheus, Cassiopeia -- and turned sour.\\n\\n \"It is remarkable,\" I\u0027d remark to Philono? in the royal boudoir, as she kindly tried to rouse me, \"what a toll pregnancy takes on teeth and muscle tone.\" Her hand would pause -- Melanippe\u0027s does, too -- for just a moment. Then she\u0027d agree, cheerfully adding varicosity, slacked breast and vaginal sphincter, striation of buttock and thigh, and loss of hair-sheen to the list of her biological expenses in the childbearing way -- all which she counted as nothing, since for three such princelets she\u0027d\u0027ve died thrice over. But as I was at it I should add, she\u0027d add, the psychological cost of parentage, to ourselves individually and to the marital relationship: fatigue, loss of spontaneity, diminishment of ardor, general heaviness -- a kind of accelerated aging, the joint effect of passing years, increased responsibility, and accumulated familiarity -- never altogether compensated for by deeper intimacy. For her part (she would go on -- what a wife this was!), she took what she was pleased to term the Tragic View of Marriage and Parenthood: reckoning together their joys and griefs must inevitably show a net loss, if only because like life itself their attrition was constant and their term mortal. But one had only different ways of losing, and to eschew matrimony and childbearing for the delights of less serious relations was in her judgment to sustain a net loss even more considerable. Nor, mind, did she regard this perspective (which she applied as well to everything from vacation trips to historical movements) as spiritually negative or bleak: to affirm it was to affirm the antinomy of the cosmos, which antimony she took to be not absurd contradiction but rich paradox, the pity and terror of the affirmation whereof effected in the human soul an ennobling catharsis. I can do it. Assuredly I can do it. That I can do it, I cannot doubt. That I cannot do it; that I can begin to imagine that I cannot do it; that I can begin to wonder whether perhaps after all I cannot do it; that I can begin to begin firmly to believe that I cannot do it; I cannot begin to imagine, I cannot begin to wonder, I cannot begin to begin. Beyond question I can do it. Can I do it? I cannot do it.\\n\\n Do it.\\n\\n Pegasus and I flew lower. \"You are descended,\" I told the children on Hippolochus\u0027s thirteenth birthday, \"from a line of half-breed horse traders reaching back through Sisyphus and Autolycus to the shifty centaurs.\"\\n\\n They sat round-eyed; tutors and governesses fled to summon Philono?, who entered with her knitting and watched their faces as I spoke, but neither protested nor interrupted.\\n\\n \"Your Grandmother Eurymede was a leading member of the Corinthian wild-mare cult,\" I declared to them. \"She claimed that Poseidon the sea-horse-god had humped her stallionwise one night as she was skinnydipping in the surf during her organization\u0027s annual harvest-moon orgy. But Dad -- your Grandpa Glaucus? -- accused her of adultery with the stable-master, if not with one of the stallions themselves, and after dragging the former to death behind his racing chariot, he banished male grooms and stonehorses from our spread.\"\\n\\n Hippolochus cried \"Hooray!\" Isander asked to be given, on his thirteenth birthday, a pony. Laodamia climbed into my lap and sucked her thumb. Out in the paddock Pegasus whinnied. Philono? purled.\\n\\n \"Horses remain a conspicuous motif in my biography,\" I guess I said, \"beginning with the circumstances of my birth. Assuming Poseidon to be my father, I\u0027ve a deal of actual horse-blood in my veins, and you in yours. Insofar as we\u0027re human, the equine traits may be regarded as recessive, but the chance that one of you may foal a centaur or sire a literal colt, while admittedly small, had as well be acknowledged. My interest in the subject of heredity, which needs no further explanation, has led me to sponsor research in this area, certain findings of which I\u0027ll impart to each of you on your wedding day.\"\\n\\n Laodamia asked where babies came from. Isander decided to have two each of sons, daughters, trotters, pacers. Hippolochus, displeased with his adolescent appearance, hoped he could make use of my research to give his own offspring black manes and tails instead of bay. Philono? smiled and said, \"Bay is beautiful.\" What I\u0027m experiencing cannot be called an identity-crisis. In order to experience an identity-crisis, one must first have enjoyed some sense of identity. The tradition of the mad genius in literature. The tradition of the double in literature. The tradition of the story within the story, the tradition of the mad editor of the text, the tradition of the unreliable narrator. \"I come now,\" how beautifully all this is managed in the Perseid, \"to the twin-business, how I more or less killed my father and my brother.\" Polyeidus, old charlatan, is that your best? No answer. But I know you\u0027re here between the lines, among the letters\u0027 curls and crooks, spreading through me like the water through this marsh. Thank heaven I get to swat you at my peak!\\n\\n \"Bellerus and Deliades,\" I\u0027m saying to the children, back in Lycia; \"Deliades and Bellerus. From the day we were born, the country quarreled over which of us should succeed to the throne of Corinth, and my brother and I quarreled over it ourselves, for fun and profit, just as you boys will when you drive me out of town.\"\\n\\n O Bellerophon! \"Bellerus it was then, and do stop bawling.\" All of you. \"Twins we were; twin brothers; look-alikes and inner opposites; and Polyeidus was our tutor. Bellerus from toddlerhood passionate, impetuous, Aphrodite\u0027s ardent darling; Deliades circumspect, prudential, in all things moderate, a venerator of Athene. And Polyeidus was our tutor. Everyone thought Deliades legitimate, as he shared the famous gray-green eyes of Glaucus and his forebears; but my earliest memory is of Mom and Dad squabbling in the next bedroom over me, whether I was Poseidon\u0027s son or the horse-groom\u0027s: a bastard to be exposed on the hillside or a demigod destined for the stars.\"\\n\\n Melanippe herself, though she loves her lover and is held to be recording his history faithfully, can be of two minds on this point when she hears him speaking to his children so. Yes, well, even Bellerus has his doubts; but though we teased and contested which was heir apparent, Deliades alone never questioned which was mortal: I liked the kid well enough; he worshipped me.\\n\\n \"And Polyeidus was your tutor,\" the children chorused. I\u0027m sending them supperless to bed: Isander has announced that he hates this story because its words are too big and it lasts too long. Hippolochus has kissed him and promised to repeat it all in little words at nap-time. My curly darling Laodamia sleeps in my lap; Philono? deftly replaces the thumb with a pacifier. Dead now, all of them: dead and dead and dead! Then do let them stay up awhile, Bellerophon, to hear the Polyeidus part.\\n\\n \"Our tutor he became, Polyeidus, Polyeidus, after being prophet laureate to the court of Corinth. Though featured in several other myths, on the strength of which Dad had hired him, he declared to us he had no memory of his pre-Corinthian past, or any youth. Some said he\u0027d been Proteus\u0027s apprentice, others that he was some stranded version of The Old Man of the Sea himself. At such stories Polyeidus shrugged, saying only that all shapeshifters are revisions of tricky Proteus. But he dismissed the conventional Protean transformations -- into animals, plants, and such -- as mere vaudeville entertainment, and would never oblige us with a gryphon or a unicorn, say, howevermuch we pled, or stoop to such homely predictions as next day\u0027s weather. For this reason, among others, he was demoted to tutor; and he urged upon us, even as boys, a severer view of magic. By no means, he used to insist, did magicians necessarily understand their art, though experience had led him to a couple of general observations on it. For example, that each time he learned something new about his powers, those powers diminished, anyhow altered. Also, that what he \"turned into\" on those occasions when he transformed was not altogether within his governance. Under certain circumstances he would frown, give a kind of grunt, and turn into something, which might or might not resemble what if anything he\u0027d had in mind. Sometimes his magic failed him when he called upon it; other times it seized him when he had no use for it; and the same was true of his prophesying. \u0027It will be alleged that Napoleon died on St. Helena in 1821,\u0027 he would announce, with no more notion than we of the man and place and date he meant, or the significance of the news; \u0027in fact he escaped to the Eastern Shore of Maryland, to establish his base for the Second Revolution.\u0027 Most disappointingly to Deliades and me, his transformations were generally into what he came to call \u0027historical personages from the future\u0027: this same Napoleon, for example, or Captain John Smith of the American plantation of Virginia: useless to our education. But no sooner did he see this pattern than he lost the capacity, and changed thenceforward only into documents, mainly epistolary: Napoleon\u0027s imaginary letter from King Theodore to Sir Robert Walpole, composed after the Emperor\u0027s surrender; Plato\u0027s Seventh Letter; the letter from Denmark to England which Hamlet transferred to Rosencrantz and Guildenstern; the Isidorian Decretals; the Protocols of the Elders of Zion; Madame de Sta?l\u0027s Lettres sur Jean-Jacques Rousseau; the \u0027Henry Letters\u0027 purchased for $50,000 by President Madison\u0027s administration from the impostor Compte de Crillon in 1811 to promote the War of 1812; the letter from Vice Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane, commander of the British fleet at Halifax, to that same president, warning that unless reparations were made for the Americans\u0027 destruction of Newark and St. Davids in Canada, the British would retaliate by burning Washington -- a letter said to be either antedated or intentionally delayed, as it reached its address when the capital was in ashes; the false letter describing mass movements of Indian and Canadian forces against Detroit, planted by the Canadian General Brock so that the U.S. General Hull would discover it, panic, and surrender the city; a similar letter dated September 11, 1813, which purported to be from Colonel Fossett of Vermont to General MacComb, advising him of massive reinforcements on the way to aid him against the Canadian General Prevost in the Battle of Plattsburg: it was entrusted to an Irishwoman of Cumberland Head whom the U.S. Secret Service, its actual author, knew to be loyal to the British; Prevost, when she dutifully turned it over to him, took it to be authentic and retreated into Canada, though no such reinforcements existed. Et cetera. Doctored letters. My brother and I were not very interested.\"\\n\\n \"Kill Granddad and Uncle Deliades, Daddy,\" Isander begged. His brother shushed him. All dead now, and sent supperless to bed. Hippolochus giddyaps happily upstairs on a fancied flying-horse to do battle with imaginary dragons, declaring to Isander, who gallops beside, that what might seem to be arbitrary and excessive punishment is in fact the stern discipline of mythic herohood, to which I am as lovingly apprenticing them as did Polyeidus me. So their mother has explained to him. Dead.\\n\\n I want sons, Bellerophon. I want my belly full. Don\u0027t withdraw. I\u0027m tired of Amazoning.\\n\\n A novel in the form of artificial fragments. A novel in diary form, in epistolary form, in notebook form, in the form of notes; a novel in the form of annotated text; a novel in the form of miscellaneous documents, a novel in the form of the novel. The tradition that no one who believes himself to be losing his mind is losing his mind. The tradition that people who speak much of committing suicide are talking themselves out of committing suicide, or is it into committing suicide. Kill Glaucus and Deliades.\\n\\n \"Our apprenticeship in herohood was real enough -- all at Deliades\u0027s instigation, for Bellerus never took it seriously. My brother drew Polyeidus out upon the subject, from love of me, never presuming to the role himself.\" My dead son\u0027s candles gutter in the uncut cake; I sit in the palace dark; my wife clicks serenely on; I don\u0027t know who my audience is.\\n\\n \" \u0027Hurrah!\u0027 cried Deliades -- the Corinthian equivalent of our hooray -- after one of Polyeidus\u0027s lectures: \u0027We don\u0027t have to hate Daddy any more!\u0027 Using, as usual, Cousin Perseus as his example, Polyeidus had enounced the first several requisites and features of the heroic vita: that the circumstances of conception be unusual; that the child be born to royal parents but be alleged to be the son of a god; that an attempt be made on his boyish life either by his maternal grandfather or his mother\u0027s spouse; et cetera. To Deliades, ever a peacemaker, this explained and excused Glaucus\u0027s jealous quarrels with Eurymede, which, as my brother loved us all, had been particularly painful for him to overhear.\\n\\n \" \u0027You merely have to fear him,\u0027 Polyeidus replied, \u0027your mother\u0027s father being already among the shades. At least Bellerus does, if we assume he\u0027s Poseidon\u0027s son.\u0027 I remember replying with a merry shrug that I feared no one. We were young men; Deliades was comely in a mortal way, but Bellerus, standing on the Isthmian strand, his copper curls lit by the descending sun -- divine!\\n\\n \" \u0027We needn\u0027t fear him either,\u0027 Deliades maintained: \u0027You said yourself that the attempted murder never does more than leave a mark, usually on the hero\u0027s thigh or foot, by which he\u0027ll be recognized later in the cycle -- and Perseus seems to\u0027ve managed without even that. All we have to worry about is that Dad himself will get killed accidentally when the thing backfires\u0027 -- as had been the would-be ancestral assassins of Perseus, Oedipus, and countless other heroes, some not to be born for generations yet, with whose biographies Polyeidus documented his point.\\n\\n \"Our tutor smiled. How describe a man who from semester to semester seldom resembled himself? That season, I believe, he was bald, shag-chinned, ill-odored, goatish; season before he\u0027d been leonine; season to come -- we\u0027ll come to that. He pointed out that to satisfy the prerequisites of herohood was not necessarily to be a hero; for every young Perseus or Moses boxed and shipped and rescued, scores of candidates must expire in their floating coffins, a menace to navigation and pollutant of the littoral. I hadn\u0027t proved I was the sea-god\u0027s son; Glaucus\u0027s attempt on my life might be successful. If it weren\u0027t, and I was a hero after all, the mythographical odds against his survival were great indeed: but he might, like Dana?\u0027s father Acrisius, live a long and useful life before retribution overtook him. For that matter, there was just a chance that the filicidal episode would be purely symbolic, a moment of peril in the company of my progenitor but not at his hands: young Odysseus\u0027s accidental goring by the boar while hunting with his Grandfather Autolycus would be a case in point when it came to pass. All the same, he said, one in my position did well to be wary -- as did one in Glaucus\u0027s -- especially as the attempt must be expected quite soon. We were well past puberty; actuarially speaking, it was overdue already.\\n\\n \" \u0027Tell us how it\u0027s going to turn out!\u0027 Deliades demanded, as would have little Isander had he heard this far. He would if he could, Polyeidus replied, but concentrate as he might, all he came up with were the images of two odd beasts: a lovely white winged stallion who had just that moment been born into the world, and a vague monstrosity in three parts, obscured from clearer view by the smoke of its own respiration. What these had to do with me and Glaucus, he couldn\u0027t say.\\n\\n \"Curling my lovely lip -- how well I see me! -- I said, \u0027A stallion would have to have wings to get into our stables!\u0027 Where, remember, there had been none since my conception -- a policy I opposed as contrary to nature and conducive to nervousness in the mares. Deliades, as fond of horses as myself, was enchanted with the notion of a winged one; he wished Dad had it for the chariot events in the Argonauts\u0027 Funeral Stakes, to be run that night. Here I make a three-part digression. . .\"\\n\\n Over my dead body. Yes. We\u0027re in a three-part digression already, sinking in exposition as in quickmire! The Deterioration of the Literary Unit: yes, well, things are deteriorating right enough, deteriorating; everything is deteriorated; deterioration everywhere. God knows I\u0027m not what I used to be; no help for that. But never for want of words! Too much to say, that\u0027s my complaint: everything to get said, and all at once or I\u0027ll forget it. Already I\u0027ve forgotten half what I\u0027d in mind to write; pen can\u0027t keep up; I make mad side-notes, notes of notes for notes; each phrase begets two more, four; I can\u0027t sleep for them; my joints are stiff; it\u0027s cold and damp here; this moment I should be lying with my warm young friend; instead it\u0027s scribble scribble the night through, red-eyed, dizzy: fine shape I\u0027ll be in at tide-turn, when the long ebb ends! What was I saying? There, gone. Digression from digression will not lead to the main stream; it\u0027s the wrong way out of the swamp. \"Float with the tide,\" I\u0027m told. By whom? My mistress? Monstrous. I know who sticks in my throat.\\n\\n \"The Corinthian succession,\" I press on: \"Over that we teasily disputed, Bellerus and Deliades, mocking the arguments of the polis. Deliades had been born first, by an hour or so, but as we were twins, primogeniture struck most people as a technicality. The issue more often hassled in the Corinthian bars and byways was the issue of legitimacy. No one denied that we had different fathers, whether because they accepted it that all twins do, or because our demeanors were dissimilar, or because the royal quarrels on that point were common gossip. What one might call the conservative position was that since Glaucus was King of Corinth, his legitimate son was his legitimate heir, regardless of who had been born first; on this view, the only question was which of us was legitimate, and as was established pages ago, nearly all inclined to Deliades by reason of his verdigris eyes. The more radical position was that if one of us had been sired by Poseidon, biological legitimacy and primogeniture were both superseded, or should be, and the proper problem was how to determine which if either of us was a demigod. Here the larger following was mine, though as the Glaucus-Deliades faction was fond of pointing out, popularity is not proof. Moreover, what was true in most such cases (Heracles and Iphicles, for instance) -- that one twin was immortal and the other not -- was not true in all; both might be either; therefore the experiment proposed in jest by Polyeidus and taken up seriously by others, of throwing us both into the Gulf of Corinth, say, and seeing who survived, was opposed as inconclusive as well as repugnant, since at best it would kill the King\u0027s legitimate son, and at worst terminate the dynasty without settling the dispute.\\n\\n \"These positions were fueled and complicated by political, historical, even logical considerations: the mare-cult itself, for example, was held to be a survival from a bygone matriarchal era, dating from the days before men realized that copulation, rather than magic, was the cause of pregnancy. The more militant votaries of the cult denied that even Glaucus had been the rightful king, and urged Eurymede to a coup d\u0027Ã©tat. Few favored an outright duumvirate of twins, but several groups called for joint rule by annual alternation, citing various actual and mythical precedents, as a peaceful resolution of the question. Even such apparently irrational expedients as the toss of a coin were seriously put forward: since only the gods knew whether one of us was a demigod and if so which, let the gods decide who should rule Corinth, et cetera.\\n\\n \"These arguments grew more heated every year, and more inextricable from political power-alignments. Glaucus, though he took no open measures against me and made every show of treating us equally, could not conceal his jealousy and alarm, especially after Polyeidus, pressed, admitted the risks involved in \u0027fathering\u0027 a demigod. Eurymede, for her part, loved both her sons and took no stand on the issue of succession; even in the matter of my paternity she was shrug-shouldered by comparison to Deliades. But on one point she brooked no question: that it was Poseidon and no other who had climbed her in the surf.\\n\\n \" \u0027A woman knows,\u0027 she would say firmly, and Glaucus tear his hair.\\n\\n \"On our thirteenth birthday\" -- shades of my sons, forgive me! -- \"asked by our parents what we wanted in the present-way, I requested the usual hunting gear, racing mares, new tunics; Deliades, secretly coached by Polyeidus, surprised the court by demanding our pedigree-papers. Glaucus blushed: \u0027They\u0027re blank. You know why. Ask for something else.\u0027 \u0027I want Polyeidus to fill in the blanks,\u0027 Deliades declared: \u0027Bring out our papers and make him turn himself into the answers.\u0027 Glaucus glowered at his seer. Eurymede sharply asked Polyeidus whether he could in fact make such a transformation; if so, why hadn\u0027t he long since, to quiet the country? Glaucus protested that any such stunt would amount to no more than another man\u0027s opinion, on the vexed question, which opinion, if Polyeidus had one, he could as well state plainly without recourse to the sort of circus tricks he famously disdained. Polyeidus nervously began a lecture on what he called the proto-existentialist view of ontological metamorphosis: within certain limits, everyone\u0027s identity was improvisable and responsible; man was free to create himself et cetera. A willful lad, I drew my sword: \u0027Fill in the blanks or die.\u0027 Polyeidus blinked, grunted like a costive, disappeared. Deliades kissed me and showed gleefully to the court a scroll that popped from nowhere into his hands: son of Glaucus and Eurymede, it read beneath his name, and under mine: out of Eurymede by Poseidon. \"Thus ended, not the quarrel (which was fired additionally thenceforth by accusations of forgery and fraud), but Polyeidus\u0027s influence in the palace, at least with Glaucus; only the good offices of Eurymede, who was pleased with both her sons\u0027 behavior on this occasion, kept him on as our tutor. It was also the end, so far as anyone knew, of his \u0027animate\u0027 transformations, and the first of his documentary. It was not, however, as some allege, the invention of writing, though to Polyeidus rightly goes the credit for having introduced, some seasons earlier, that problematic medium to Corinth, where it never caught on. Writing itself, he told us in the Q \u0026 A after his act, would be invented some generations later by a stranded minstrel pissing in the sand of a deserted Aegean isle, making up endings to the Trojan War. It was the seer\u0027s limited capacity to read the future that enabled him to borrow certain ideas therefrom prior to their historical introduction. Why didn\u0027t he make use of this powerful ability to take over the world? Because knowledge, not power, was his vocation; he did not agree with Francis Bacon that the two are one; on the contrary, his own experience was that the more he understood, the less potent he became; the semantic and logical problems alone, to look no further, posed by such a stunt as stealing from the future, were a can of worms that no sane man would stir up unnecessarily. Et cetera. No one understood. \u0027Put it this way, then,\u0027 he grumbled: \u0027when I look back at the history of the future I see that Polyeidus in fact never capitalized on this trick. Since I didn\u0027t, I can\u0027t; therefore I won\u0027t.\u0027 \u0027Thanks for the present,\u0027 I said to my brother. \u0027Many happy returns,\u0027 he replied -- not knowing, as he couldn\u0027t see seer-wise, there\u0027d be but five.\"\\n\\n The eyes of Melanippe\u0027s lover are gray-green: explain. Directly. Happy birthday, dead Hippolochus; happy birthday to you. Digression won\u0027t save them, dear Bellerophon; do come to it. Your eighteenth birthday. Sibyl. Chariot-race scene. The curse of God upon you, Polyeidus, snake in the grass, whom even as I bored kind Philono? decades after with this tale I didn\u0027t know to be its villain!\\n\\n \"Eighteen, are we? On the beach? The horse race? Sibyl. Polyeidus had a daughter, who knows by whom. Sibyl. Younger than we. That summer she was our friend. Deliades adored her, she me. I screwed her while he watched, in a little grove down on the shore, by Aphrodite\u0027s sacred well. Honey-locusts grew there, shrouded by rank creepers and wild grape that spread amid a labyrinth of paths. There was about that place a rich fetidity: gray rats and blackbirds decomposed, by schoolboys done to death; suburban wild dogs spoored the way; part the vines at the base of any tree and you might find a strew of pellets and fieldmouse-bones disgorged by feasting owls. It was the most exciting place we knew; its queer smell retched us if we breathed too deeply, but in measured inhalations it had a rich, a stirring savor. There they played, Bellerus and Sibyl, while Dee-Dee watched: no spite intended, but it cut him up. I told her to let him in too; I didn\u0027t mind, and he was virgin. Nothing doing. I held her down for him to hump; he wouldn\u0027t even look.\\n\\n The mad child offered to relinquish his claim to Corinth in my favor if she\u0027d marry him. No deal. \u0027Bellerus can have Corinth the way he has me,\u0027 she would say sullenly: \u0027by taking it, whenever he wants to.\u0027 I decided what to give my brother for his birthday gift that night. Now it\u0027s afternoon: Deliades has drawn Polyeidus out on the hero-business, above, brought him to preliminary images of Pegasus and Chimera, mentioned the Argonauts\u0027 Funeral Stakes, here we go. Ignore the myths that locate Glaucus\u0027s death at Iolchis or Theban Pontiae on the occasion of Jason\u0027s funeral games for Pelias: it happened at the regular Isthmian games, which in those days we called the Argonauts\u0027 Funeral Stakes in memory of the Pelian originals. It was a big day on the Isthmus, especially for Deliades: as many former Argonauts as could make it were there, and assorted other stars; strolling through the locker rooms was like touring a Hall of Fame; Dee-Dee, ecstatic, knew the program by heart, pointed out to me everyone from Acastus to Zetes, rattled off biographies and box scores like a sports announcer, urged me to help him catch the winged horse in time for us to race as a team next year, bet his whole allowance for the lunar month on Glaucus, a very long shot, to win the unlimited chariot event.\\n\\n \" \u0027Not a chance,\u0027 I said. \u0027Those mares are crazy.\u0027 Deliades agreed, but loyally put his drachmae on the line; it would break Dad\u0027s heart, he said, to lose the biggest race on the card, which he\u0027d placed and showed in in the two years previous and trained for all that season. We pressed Polyeidus for prediction. \u0027Don\u0027t be impudent,\u0027 he replied. In those days I drew sword readily. \u0027Your father by a quarter-furlong,\u0027 he crossly volunteered, \u0027with hippomanes and your help. I see you\u0027re meeting my daughter tonight in the grove again, which also happens to be on the far side of the finish line.\u0027 By full-moon-light, he declared, near the lip of the well, grew the potent herb, which only a votary of the goddess could find and pluck: a mild aphrodisiac and hallucinogen to males of several species, it had a graver effect on mares, and for that reason, though its sale, possession, and use were prohibited by law, it was much favored by the mare-maids for their mysteries. Sibyl having shown some talent, even as a child, for sniffing it out, Polyeidus had apprenticed her to Aphrodite and become Eurymede\u0027s exclusive dealer in the weed -- the supply of which, however, was so small that for some years he had been able to meet the cult\u0027s demands only by transforming himself into an amulet of concentrated \u0027hip,\u0027 as they called it, to be sniffed by the company in turn. In order to ingratiate himself with Glaucus, he confessed, what a story, he had offered to become that amulet that night: at post time Dad would give his team a toke; the mares, long starved for love, would go mad for more; in the grove, where according to Sibyl a rare new crop had sprouted, I was to pluck it at the signal, step forth and crush it in my hands; one whiff of the fresh and the Glaucan mares would finish first. \u0027Hurrah!\u0027 cried Deliades. \u0027Why me?\u0027 I asked. Because, Dee-Dee explained, it was a symbolic surrogate for the attempted filicide required to satisfy the Pattern: the turned-on mares, Dad at the reins, would fly as if at me, but I\u0027d have ample time to take cover with him and Sibyl in the grove. No one would be hurt; Glaucus would win handily; his gratitude for our help must overcome any residue of fear in him of me or ill will toward our tutor. Polyeidus paled, then gave my brother on the spot an alpha-plus for the semester in Mythology I.\\n\\n \" \u0027I hate fixed races,\u0027 I complained to Dee-Dee in the grove. \u0027Me too,\u0027 said Sibyl. \u0027Yes, well,\u0027 said Deliades. Full moon, scattered clouds, balmy; couldn\u0027t see a thing when the moon was hid except for the beach-fires flaring from the Argonautic cookout; then, between clouds, the grove glowed phosphor-green. I made the most of each obscurity to deal Dee-Dee in, preliminary to his birthday gift: with a hand on one of Sibyl\u0027s breasts I would put his hand on the other, or under her chiton, which she wore in the Amazonian manner. . .\"\\n\\n Even then! exclaims Melanippe. Bellerophon wonders where she\u0027s been these several pages? Long before Anteia brought the style to Tiryns, we had real Amazons in Corinth to mind the horses after Glaucus\u0027s decree, and the fashion caught on with the younger women. That\u0027s why, when Bellerophon saw Melanippe among Anteia\u0027s dykes and falsies, he knew at once that she alone was the real thing. Melanippe herself is less certain -- but let it go. He begs her pardon? No, please, let it go: go back to manhandling Sibyl; you\u0027re telling this to Philono??\\n\\n I talk to myself. Mad Sibyl\u0027s dead, sweet Philono? -- everyone\u0027s dead except us cursed with immortality. Hum. \"In every case,\" I run on, \"she knew at touch whose hand was whose. Too bad for Dee-Dee. Now let\u0027s see. The chariots assembled down the strand. I decided we\u0027d play a prank on Glaucus and not fix the race after all; Deliades objected; Sibyl went round about the well on hands and knees to pluck the herb, which we chewed till we were high as Helicon. I set her after more, promising to climb her in our pet fashion, stallionwise, when she was done, then whispered to Dee-Dee what I had in mind: he was to declare impatiently, for Sibyl\u0027s benefit, that he meant to take my place in Polyeidus\u0027s program, crushing hippomanes, while I dallied, to fetch the mares on behalf of Glaucus and his own investment; but at the moon\u0027s occlusion it was my place on Sibyl he\u0027d take instead, humping her so ardently hind-to that she\u0027d be nothing wiser till too late. Stoned and love-starved as he was, the boy refused. I told him that only if he took her, as my gift, would I fix the race -- which just then started with a roar. Let\u0027s see. Hum, that stuff was strong; things went awry; Glaucus gave the mares their dose of amulet and they went crazy; Dee-Dee -- damn you, Polyeidus! -- Dee-Dee, let\u0027s see, we were stoned and hot as rocks from Mount Chimera; who knew who was who. Our father -- Polyeidus, viper whose wriggles these words are! -- he\u0027d, let\u0027s see, he\u0027d tricked us all; we\u0027d all tricked one another; Polyeidus hadn\u0027t mentioned that hippomanes would drive those mares carnivorous. He couldn\u0027t lose, God curse him, howevermany of us went. Dad\u0027s team charged crazily out front, snapping and frothing toward the grove; that hand-crushed business was a trick; we reeked hip to the heavens. All hid behind the well; stoned Sibyl, still on all fours, cried for love. I guess I -- well, I guess I bared her butt just about when the horses turned on Glaucus, going for the amulet; spilled him at grove\u0027s-edge and went at him. Sibyl made to make rescue -- mad mares eat only men -- but I rammed her flat into the honeysuckle. At first bite Glaucus shouted. My brother sprang to save him in my stead. The moon came out; I drove in; Polyeidus, not to be gobbled, changed from amulet-\u0027round-Glaucus\u0027s-neck to ditto-\u0027round-his-daughter\u0027s (and straightway lost the power of such mere spatial relocation); Sibyl shrieked \u0027Bellerus!\u0027 as I pumped home and my brother went under the hooves. The whole team crashed into the creepers then, having gutted Glaucus and battered my brother past anyone\u0027s knowing. Sibyl, mad from that moment forward, rose up and calmed them, crooning \u0027Bellerus! Bellerus!\u0027 as they nuzzled the amulet between her breasts. But I leaped for my life into the well, so banging my head on its old oak bucket that I bear yet a crescent scar there and hear a roaring in my skull like wind or time. That blow, well, turned my eyes gray-green, let\u0027s see, impaired my memory, hear how I falter. If there are discrepancies or lacunae in this account, you must fill in the blanks yourself. All night I trembled in the well with frogs and crawlies, would\u0027ve gone under but for the bucket-rope, heard hubbub overhead. Toward morning, when things stilled, as I miserably watched one star wink like Medusa down my hole, Polyeidus cranked me up, stone-stiff. We couldn\u0027t make each other out.\\n\\n \" \u0027You\u0027re either a comer or a goner,\u0027 he advised me. By holding back and humping Sibyl, he declared, I had in effect murdered my father and my brother. If he himself bore no grudge against me, it was because while the shock had left his daughter more or less deranged, it seemed also to have occasioned her first experience of second sight, on the basis of which he meant to recommend to Eurymede that she be made priestess of the grove for life. Moreover, though it went without saying that he hadn\u0027t exactly foreseen this debacle in detail, he couldn\u0027t say either that it came as a total surprise: it fit the Pattern, clearly, against which, it being preordained by an order of things transcending even Zeus\u0027s power much to alter, it were vain for a mere seer much to kick. Still and all, things were hot in town for both of us: my brother\u0027s supporters and Glaucus\u0027s -- especially those who\u0027d lost their tunics at the races -- were crying Regicide and Crooked Track, and went so far as to accuse Polyeidus of engineering my succession. My heroic nature, he daresaid, impelled me straight through the waiting lynch mobs and sundry ambuscadoes to assert my claim; but the same Pattern which certified that kingly right (not to mention good diplomacy) required that I defer it. Just as Perseus, even as he spoke, was completing the exile trip from Seriphos through Egypt and Joppa, killing a Gorgon and picking up a bride before returning to rule Mycenae, so I, in my tutor\u0027s opinion, must beat it out of Corinth for the present. \u0027Leave it to me to calm the country and look after your mother. Take a new name. Make the grand tour. Discharge a few labors, dispatch a monster or two, et cetera. You\u0027ll know when it\u0027s time to come home; they always do. Questions?\u0027\\n\\n \"I asked for a copy of the Pattern, by way of autobiographical road map. After some pause he said he hadn\u0027t one on him just then, but would forward it me as soon as he could envision my next mailing address. To what name would he send it? He paused again. \u0027Bellerophon, of course. Is this a test?\u0027 We parted uncertainly in the dark. Let\u0027s see. I took off down the road. Bellerophon means Bellerus the Killer. Questions?\"\\n\\n But my dead darlings were abed long since; dead Philono? was dropped off too in the drowsy dusk. Soon I\u0027ll wake and hurt her with the story of her sister. Questions?\\n\\n Melanippe has several. Many, even, all disquieting. If she defers them, let\u0027s see, let\u0027s say it\u0027s because Medusa, in the Perseid, puts off hers till the epilogue. Not that a self-respecting Amazon in any respect resembles -- but never mind. Wake her.\\n\\n Let her rest in peace; let them all. O I wish --\\n\\n How high now are Bellerophon and Pegasus? Gorse-top low. Wave-top low. All but sea-leveled.\\n\\n Wake her then; hurt her now. The sooner begun, et cetera.\\n\\n \"Here\u0027s the full story of my sexual adventure with your sister,\" I\u0027d wake my wife to announce. No. Aye. O. Done.\\n\\n \"I\" On. \"I believe I\u0027m familiar with the several standard versions,\" let\u0027s say she\u0027d say, rubbing her eyes. \"A classical myth, however, is yawn excuse me infinitely retellable, and the connoisseur\u0027s pleasure is in those small variations, discrepancies, and lacunae that invariably yawn obtain among renditions. Add to that my love for both principals in this particular episode in the grander narrative of your career, and you will yawn see that no amount of pain occasioned by the events themselves can altogether spoil my pleasure in their rehearsal. I\u0027ll make coffee.\"\\n\\n O. Nevertheless I gnash my teeth and proceeded. \"For a year or two after dropping out of Corinth I hiked across the Peloponnese, doing odd jobs, seeing the sights, reconstructing as best I could from memory the Pattern. I felt I\u0027d completed, in the main, its first quarter, the quadrant of Departure: my conception and birth certificate were in order; Glaucus was dead; I had the regulation scar, if not in quite the regular place, to mark what could pass as his attempt to kill me; I\u0027d crossed a sort of threshold, in proper darkness, got my travel orders at a well in a sacred grove from a certified Spielman, set out to westward under pseudonym. When I reached Sandy Pylos, on the coast, I supposed that the correct thing to do was ship on as oarsman, say, aboard the next boat west, to commence my second quarter -- Initiation -- with a night-sea journey.\\n\\n \"But the more I combed the beach, the more I came to question whether I\u0027d got off after all on just the right foot. Even allowing for some flexibility in the Pattern, I doubted whether any mythic hero could commence his principal tasks with blood-guilt, as we call it, on his hands: Odysseus and Aeneas, to name only two of Polyeidus\u0027s \u0027personages from the future,\u0027 would be obliged to retrace their steps laboriously in mid-career merely to bury a graveless shipmate lost by accident. Nor was it clear, as it seemed to me it should be, what exactly I was aiming for, even ostensibly: no hero of my acquaintance went west merely for the Pattern\u0027s sake; indeed, as many as not began by going east, in order to return to a westward home. Since I was to my knowledge homeless but for Corinth, to make it on my present course would require circumnavigation of the globe -- and Polyeidus had prophesied to us years past that not for centuries would it be speculated, much less demonstrated, that the earth is round. Finally, as I stood making idle water one forenoon on the strand (like that nameless minstrel Polyeidus mentioned), I thought I saw a winged white horse flap past out on the horizon. Could\u0027ve been a gull -- the distance was far, and I was preoccupied with making my name in imaginary letters -- but it put me in mind of magic Pegasus, of Perseus\u0027s fancy sandals, and of my own lack of any gear besides the tool in hand, which had got me only into trouble. In short, I came to feel that at least three things were wanting before I could proceed with my career: clearer counsel on the matter of absolution; a more definite course of hero-work, with specific adversaries, goals, and labors; and a magic weapon, vehicle, or secret with which to address the work. For all three I must apply either to the prophet or to the gods; not to lose more time I applied to both, making prayer-stops at every temple of Athene along the way back to Polyeidus.\"\\n\\n \"Athene?\" Why not Aphrodite?\\n\\n To entertain wife and mistress at the same time with the same tale is hard. \"Dee-Dee, Athene\u0027s pet, died, Philono?, there in Aphrodite\u0027s grove, right?\" \"Well.\" And I\u0027d been marinated, Melanippe, overnight in the sex-queen\u0027s hole. So? \"It wasn\u0027t love Bellerophon needed, but advice. Come Tiryns -- as close to Corinth as I felt it safe to go -- I got both.\" \"Um.\" Um.\\n\\n Bellerophon wishes he had never begun this story. But he began it. Then he wishes he were dead. But he\u0027s not. Therefore he reconstructs it painfully for his darling Amazon, as he once pained with it patient Philono?. Dee-Dee (dead) had daydreamed of riding that white horse till the night mares made hay of him, and on Polyeidus\u0027s advice had even fasted once five days and nights in Athene\u0027s Corinth temple, to find out how to find it. On the fifth -- so he told me, right? -- he thought he heard the goddess say: \"Finding Pegasus is easy; he hangs around my sister\u0027s wells and bushes; I\u0027m surprised you haven\u0027t seen him grazing down below. But to catch and ride him\u0027s another story: for that you need this.\" She fetched from around her tunic a fine gold bridle; even let him take it in his hand. But when he woke it was only his torpid tool he held, as I mine later -- so he told me and Sibyl, stoned, next evening in the grove, right, the last of his life, when he let himself go, ran to Dad\u0027s rescue, got foddered. In the real Bellerophoniad this would be established in an earlier digression.\\n\\n So: on the way to Tiryns it occurred to me to try again -- i.e., Bellerophon decided to do what dead Dee-Dee\u0027d done. The first two nights, nothing: those temples were roadside shrines, where all I could get was a fuzzy image in black and white of the horse himself, like that early one Polyeidus had picked up. On the third day I came to Tiryns, where King Proetus had a Naw AOhnhz large enough for the greatest reception. There he and Queen Anteia received me as a suppliant; over a five-course meal (but I was fasting) I told them the story of my life (First Flood, Part One) and asked permission to fast and sleep for the next three nights in the temple.\\n\\n \"There\u0027s room,\" said the King -- a mild-mannered monarch, middle-aged, who fiddled with his flatware as I spoke. \"And I imagine we can arrange a purification, if you really fault yourself for that fiasco on the beach -- I must say I\u0027ve heard more plausible accounts from my people up in Corinth. None of my business, I\u0027m sure, but aren\u0027t you being a bit eager to take the blame?\"\\n\\n \"I killed my brother,\" I insisted. \"My dad too -- I mean my foster father.\"\\n\\n Proetus sighed. \"O yes, the dem\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/kehuan/349/222.html","bookId":312,"book":{"id":312,"title":"èè²ç´«ç½å° Violets Are Blue","description":"ç®ä»ï¼ Back Page: At this point I interrupted my sister as usual to say, You have a way with words, Scheherazade.
