{"id":100541,"no":6,"title":"Page 6","content":"A CLUE IN THE RIFT A throgate held the skeletal arm aloft. He grumbled at its inactivity, and gave it a little shake. The fingers began to claw once more and the dwarf grinned and reached the bony arm over his shoulder, sighing contentedly as the scraping digits worked at a hard-to-reach spot in the middle of his itchy back. \"How long ye think it\u0027ll last, elf?\" he asked. Jarlaxle, too concerned to even acknowledge the dwarf\u0027s antics, just shrugged and continued on his meandering way. The drow wasn\u0027t sure where he was going. Any who knew Jarlaxle would have read the gravity of the situation clearly in his uncertain expression, for rarely, if ever, had anyone ever witnessed Jarlaxle Baenre perplexed. The drow realized that he couldn\u0027t wait for Hephaestus to come to him. He didn\u0027t want to encounter such a foe on his own, or with only Athrogate at his side. He considered returning to Luskan - Kimmuriel and Bregan D\u0027aerthe could certainly help - but his instincts argued against that. Once again, he would be allowing Hephaestus the offensive, and would be pitted against a foe that could apparently raise undead minions to his command with ease. Above all else, Jarlaxle wanted to take the fight to the dragon, and he believed that Cadderly might well prove the solution to his troubles. But how could he enlist the priest, who was surely no willing ally of the dark elves? Except one particular dark elf. And wouldn\u0027t it be grand to have Drizzt Do\u0027Urden and some of his mighty friends along for the hunt? But how? So at Jarlaxle\u0027s direction, the pair traveled eastward, meandering across the Silver Marches toward Mithral Hall. It would take them easily a tenday, and Jarlaxle wasn\u0027t sure he had that kind of time to spare. He resisted Reverie that first day, and when night came, he meditated lightly, standing on a precarious perch. A cold breeze found him, and as he shifted to curl against it, he slipped from the narrow log upon which he stood and the resulting stumble startled him. His hand already in his pocket, Jarlaxle pulled forth a fistful of ceramic pebbles. He spun a quick circle, spreading them around, and as each hit the ground, it broke open and the enchantment within, dweomers of bright light, spewed forth. \"What the - ?\" Athrogate cried, startled from his sleep by the sudden brightness. Jarlaxle paid him no heed. He moved fast after a shadowy figure racing away from the magical light, a painful thing to undead creatures. He threw another light bomb ahead of the fleeing, huddled form, then another as it veered toward a shadowy patch. \"Hurry, dwarf!\" the drow called, and he soon heard Athrogate huffing and puffing in pursuit. As soon as Athrogate passed him, Jarlaxle drew out a wand and brought forth a burst of brighter and more powerful light, landing it near the shadowy form. The creature shrieked, an awful, preternatural keening that sent a shiver coursing down Jarlaxle\u0027s spine. That howl didn\u0027t slow Athrogate in the least, and the brave dwarf charged in with abandon, his morningstars spinning in both hands, arms outstretched. Athrogate called upon the enchantment of the morningstar in his right hand and explosive oil oozed over its metallic head. The dwarf leaped at the cowering creature and swung with all his might, thinking to end the fight with a single, explosive smite. The morningstar hit nothing substantial, just hummed through the empty night. Then Athrogate yelped in pain as a sharp touch hit his shoulder, a point of sudden and burning agony. He fell back, swinging with abandon, his morningstars crisscrossing, again hitting nothing. The dwarf saw the specter\u0027s dark, cold hands reaching toward him, so he tried a different tactic. He swung his morningstars in from opposite sides, aiming the heads to collide directly in the center of the shadowy darkness. Jarlaxle watched the battle with a curious eye, trying to gauge this foe. The specter was a minion of Hephaestus, obviously, and he knew well the usual qualities of incorporeal undead denizens. Athrogate\u0027s weapon should have harmed it, at least some - the dwarf\u0027s morningstars were heavily enchanted. Even the most powerful undead creatures, the ones that existed on both the Prime Material Plane and a darker place of negative energy, should not have such complete immunity to his assault. Jarlaxle winced and looked away when Athrogate\u0027s morningstar heads clanged together, the volatile oil exploding in a blinding flash, a concussive burst that forced the dwarf to stumble backward. When the drow looked again, the specter seemed wholly unbothered by the burst. Jarlaxle took note of something unusual. Precisely as the morningstar heads collided, the specter seemed to diminish. In the moment of explosion, the creature appeared to vanish or shrink. As the undead creature approached the dwarf, it grew substantial again, those dark hands reaching forth to inflict more cold agony. \"Elf! I can\u0027t be hitting the damned thing!\" The dwarf howled in pain and staggered back. \"More oil!\" Jarlaxle yelled, a sudden idea coming to him. \"Smash them together again.\" \"That hurt, elf! Me arms\u0027re numb!\" \"Do it!\" Jarlaxle commanded. He fired off his wand again, and the burst of light caused the specter to recoil, buying Athrogate a few heartbeats. Jarlaxle pulled off his hat and reached inside, and as Athrogate swung mightily with his opposing morningstars, the drow pulled forth a flat circle of cloth, like the black lining of his hat. He threw it out and it spun, elongating as it sailed past the dwarf. The morningstars collided in another explosion, throwing Athrogate backward again. The specter, as Jarlaxle expected, faded, began to diminish to nothingness - no, not to nothingness, but to some other plane or dimension. And the fabric circle, the magical extra-dimensional pocket created by the power of Jarlaxle\u0027s enchanted hat, fell over the spot. The sudden glare caused by waves of energy - purple, blue, and green - rolled forth from the spot, pounding out a hum of sheer power. The fabric of the world tore open. Jarlaxle and Athrogate floated, weightless, staring at a spot that was once a clearing in the trees but seemed to have been replaced with ... starscape. \"What\u0027d\u0027ye do, elf!\" the dwarf cried, his voice modulating in volume as if carried on gigantic intermittent winds. \"Stay away from it!\" Jarlaxle warned, and he felt a slight push at his back, compelling him toward the starry spot, the rift, he knew, to the Astral Plane. Athrogate began to flail wildly, suddenly afraid, for he was not far from that dangerous place. He began to spin head over heels and all around, but the gyrations proved irrelevant to his inexorable drift toward the stars. \"Not like that!\" Jarlaxle called. \"How, ye stupid elf?\" For Jarlaxle, the solution was easy. His drift carried him beside a tree, still rooted solidly in the firmament. He grabbed on with one hand and held himself easily in place, and knew that an easy push would propel him away from the rift. That was exactly what it was, Jarlaxle knew, a tear in the fabric of the Prime Material Plane, the result of mixing the energies of two extra-dimensional spaces. For Jarlaxle, who carried items of holding that created extra-dimensional pockets larger than their apparent capacity, a pair of belt pouches that did the same, and several other trinkets that could facilitate similar dweomers, the consequences of mingling them was not unknown or unexpected. What surprised him, though, was that his extra-dimensional hole had reacted in such a way with that shadowy being. All he\u0027d hoped to do was trap the thing within the magical hole when it tried to flow back into the plane of the living. \"Throw something at it!\" Jarlaxle cried, and as Athrogate lifted his arm as if to launch one of his morningstars, the drow added, \"Something you never need to retrieve!\" Athrogate held his throw at the last moment then pulled his heavy pack off his back. He waited until he spun around, then heaved it at the rift. The opposite reaction sent the dwarf floating backward, away from the tear - far enough for Jarlaxle to take a chance with a rope. He threw an end out toward Athrogate, close enough for the dwarf to grasp, and as soon as Athrogate held on, the drow tugged hard and brought the dwarf sailing toward him, then right past. Jarlaxle took note that Athrogate drifted only a few feet before exiting the area of weightlessness and falling hard to his rump. His eyes never leaving the curious starscape that loomed barely ten strides away, Jarlaxle pushed himself back and dropped to stand beside Athrogate as the dwarf pulled himself to his feet. \"What\u0027d\u0027ye do?\" the dwarf asked in all seriousness. \"I have no idea,\" Jarlaxle replied. \"Worked, though,\" Athrogate offered. Jarlaxle, not so certain of that, merely smirked. They kept watch over the rift for a short while, and gradually the phenomenon dissipated, the wilderness returning to its previous firmament with no discernable damage. All was as it had been, except that the specter was gone. \"Still going east?\" Athrogate asked as he and Jarlaxle started out the next day. \"That was the plan.\" \"The plan to win.\" \"Yes.\" \"I\u0027m thinkin\u0027 we won last night,\" the dwarf said. \"We defeated a minion,\" Jarlaxle explained. \"It has always been my experience that defeating a minion of a powerful foe only makes that foe angrier.\" \"So we should\u0027ve let the shadow thing win?\" Jarlaxle\u0027s sigh elicited a loud laugh from Athrogate. On they went through the day, and at camp that night, Jarlaxle dared to allow himself some time in Reverie. And there, in his own subconscious, Hephaestus found him again. Clever drow, the dracolich said in his mind. Did you truly believe you could so easily escape me? Jarlaxle threw up his defenses in the form of images of Menzoberranzan, the great Underdark city. He concentrated on a distinct memory, of a battle his mercenary band had waged on behalf of Matron Mother Baenre. In that fight, a much younger Jarlaxle had engaged two separate weapons masters right in front of the doors of Melee-Magthere, the drow school of martial training. It was perhaps the most desperate struggle Jarlaxle had ever known, and one he would not have survived were it not for the intervention of a third weapons master, one of a lower-ranked House - House Do\u0027Urden, actually, though that battle had been fought many decades before Drizzt drew his first breath. That memory had long been crystallized in the mind of Jarlaxle Baenre, with images distinct and clear, and a level of tumult enough to keep his thoughts occupied. And with such emotional mental churning, the drow hoped he wouldn\u0027t surrender his current position to the intrusive Hephaestus. Well done, drow! Hephaestus congratulated him. But it will not matter in the end. Do you truly believe you can so easily hide from me? Do you truly believe your simple, but undeniably clever trick, would destroy one of the Seven? One of what \u0027Seven\u0027? Jarlaxle asked himself. He put the question to the back of his mind quickly and resumed his mental defense. He understood that his bold stand did little or nothing to shake the confidence of Hephaestus, but he remained certain that the hunting dragon wasn\u0027t making much headway. Then a notion occurred to him and he was jolted from his confrontation with the dragon, and from his Reverie entirely. He stumbled away from the tree upon which he was leaning. \"The Seven,\" he said, and swallowed hard, trying to recall all that he had learned about the origins of the Crystal Shard - and the seven liches who had created it. \"The Seven ...\" Jarlaxle whispered again, and a shiver ran up his spine. Jarlaxle set the pace even swifter the next day, nightmare and hell boar running hard along the road. When they saw the smoke of an encampment not far ahead, Jarlaxle pulled to a halt. \"Orcs, likely,\" he explained to the dwarf. \"We are near the border of King Obould\u0027s domain.\" \"Let\u0027s kill \u0027em, then.\" Jarlaxle shook his head. \"You must learn to exploit your enemies, my hairy little friend,\" he explained. \"If these are Obould\u0027s orcs, they are not enemies of Mithral Hall.\" \"Bah!\" Athrogate said, and spat on the ground. \"We go to them not as enemies, but as fellow travelers,\" Jarlaxle ordered. \"Let us see what we might learn.\" Noting the disappointment on Athrogate\u0027s face, he added, \"But do keep your morningstars near at hand.\" It was indeed a camp of Many Arrow orcs, who served Obould, and though they sprang to readiness, brandishing weapons, at the casual approach of the curious pair - dwarf and drow - they held their arrows. \"We are travelers from Luskan,\" Jarlaxle greeted them in perfect command of Orcish, \"trade emissaries to King Obould and King Bruenor.\" Out of the corner of his mouth, he bade Athrogate to remain calm and to keep his mount\u0027s pace steady and slow. \"We have good food to share,\" Jarlaxle added. \"And better grog.\" \"What\u0027d\u0027ye tell \u0027em?\" Athrogate asked, seeing the porcine soldiers brighten and nod at one another. \"That we\u0027re all going to get drunk together,\" Jarlaxle whispered back. \"In a pig\u0027s fat rump!\" the dwarf protested. \"Wherever you please,\" the drow replied. He slid down from his saddle and dismissed his hell-spawned steed. \"Come, let us learn what we may.\" It all started rather tentatively, with Jarlaxle producing both food and \"grog\" aplenty. The drink went over well with the orcs, even more so when the dwarf spat out his first taste of it with disgust. He looked to Jarlaxle as if dumbstruck, as if he never could have imagined anything potent tasting so wretched. Jarlaxle responded with a wink and held out his flask to replenish Athrogate\u0027s mug, but with a different mixture, the dwarf noted. Gutbuster. Not another word of complaint came from Athrogate. \"You friends with Drizzt Do\u0027Urden?\" one of the orcs asked Jarlaxle, the creature\u0027s tongue loosened by the drink. \"You know of him?\" the drow replied, and several of the orcs nodded. \"As do I! I have met him many times, and fought beside him on occasion - and woe to those who stand before his scimitars!\" That last bit didn\u0027t go over well with the orcs, and one of them growled threateningly. \"Drizzt is wounded in his heart,\" said the orc, and the creature grinned as if that fact pleased him immensely. Jarlaxle stared hard and tried to decipher that notion. \"Catti-brie?\" \"A fool now,\" the orc explained. \"Touched by magic. Daft by magic.\" A couple of the others chuckled. The Weave, Jarlaxle realized, for he was not ignorant of the traumatic events unfolding around him. Luskan, too, a city that once housed the Hosttower of the Arcane and still named many of the wizards of that place as citizens - and allies of Bregan D\u0027aerthe - had certainly been touched by the unraveling Weave. \"Where is she?\" Jarlaxle asked, and the orc shrugged as if it hardly cared. But Jarlaxle surely did, for a plan was already formulating. To defeat Hephaestus, he needed Cadderly. To enlist Cadderly, he needed Drizzt. Could it be that Catti-brie, and so Drizzt, needed Cadderly as well? \"Guenhwyvar,\" the young girl called. Her eyes leveled in their sockets, showing their rich blue hue. Drizzt and Bruenor stood dumbfounded in the small chamber, staring at Catti-brie, whose demeanor had suddenly changed to that of her pre-teen self. She had floated off the bed again, rising as her eyes rolled to white, purple flames and crackling energy dancing all around her, her thick hair flowing in a wind neither Drizzt nor Bruenor could feel. Drizzt had seen this strange event before, and had warned Bruenor, but when his daughter\u0027s posture and demeanor, everything about the way she held herself, had changed so subtly, yet dramatically, Bruenor nearly fell over with weakness. Truly she seemed a different person at that moment, a younger Catti-brie. Bruenor called to her, his voice thick with desperation and remorse, but she seemed not to notice. \"Guenhwyvar?\" she called again. She seemed to be walking then, slowly and deliberately, though she didn\u0027t actually move. She held out one hand as if toward the cat - the cat who wasn\u0027t there. Her voice was gentle and quiet when she asked, \"Where\u0027s the dark elf, Guenhwyvar? Can ye take me to him?\" \"By the gods,\" Drizzt muttered. \"What is it, elf?\" Bruenor demanded. The young girl straightened, then slowly turned away from the pair. \"Be ye a drow?\" she asked. Then she paused, as though she heard a response. \"I\u0027ve heard that drow be evil, but ye don\u0027t seem so to me.\" \"Elf?\" Bruenor begged. \"Her first words to me,\" Drizzt whispered. \"Me name\u0027s Catti-brie,\" she said, still talking to the wall away from the pair. \"Me dad is Bruenor, King o\u0027 Clan Battlehammer.\" \"She\u0027s on Kelvin\u0027s Cairn,\" said Bruenor. \"The dwarves,\" Catti-brie said. \"He\u0027s not me real dad. Bruenor took me in when I was just a babe, when me real parents were ...\" She paused and swallowed hard. \"The first time we met, on Kelvin\u0027s Cairn,\" Drizzt breathlessly explained, and indeed he was hearing the woman, then just a girl, exactly as he had that unseasonably warm winter\u0027s day on the side of a faraway mountain. Catti-brie looked over her shoulder at them - no, not at them, but above them. \"She\u0027s a beautiful ca - \" she started to say, but she sucked in her breath suddenly and her eyes rolled up into her head and her arms went out to her sides. The unseen magical energy rushed back into her once more, shaking her with its intensity. And before their astonished eyes, Catti-brie aged once again. By the time she floated down to the floor, both Drizzt and Bruenor were hugging her, and they gently moved her to her bed and laid her down. \"Elf?\" Bruenor asked, his voice thick with desperation. \"I don\u0027t know,\" replied the trembling Drizzt. He tried to fight back the tears. The moment Catti-brie had recaptured was so precious to him, so burned into his heart and soul.... They sat beside the woman\u0027s bed for a long while, even after Regis came in to remind Bruenor that he was due in his audience chamber. Emissaries had arrived from Silverymoon and Nesme, from Obould and from the wider world. It was time for Bruenor Battlehammer to be king of Mithral Hall again. But leaving his daughter there on her bed was one of the toughest things Bruenor Battlehammer had ever done. To the dwarf\u0027s great relief, after ensuring that the woman was sleeping soundly, Drizzt went out with him, leaving the reliable Regis to watch over her. The black-bearded dwarf stood in line, third from the front, trying to remember his lines. He was an emissary, a formal representative to a king\u0027s court. It was not a new situation to Athrogate, for he had once lived a life that included daily audiences with regional leaders. Once, long ago. \"Don\u0027t rhyme,\" he warned himself quietly, for as Jarlaxle had pointed out, any of his silly word games would likely tip off Drizzt Do\u0027Urden to the truth about the disguised dwarf. He cleared his throat loudly, wishing he had his morningstars with him, or some other weapon that might get him out of there if his true identity were discovered. The first representative had his audience with the dwarf king and moved out of the way. Athrogate rehearsed his lines again, telling himself that it was really simple, assuring himself that Jarlaxle had prepared him well. He went through the routine over and over. \"Come forward, then, fellow dwarf,\" King Bruenor said, startling Athrogate. \"I\u0027ve too much to do to be sittin\u0027 here waitin\u0027!\" Athrogate looked at the seated Bruenor, then at Drizzt Do\u0027Urden, who stood behind the throne. As he locked gazes with Drizzt, he saw a hint of recognition, for they had matched weapons eight years before, during the fall of Deudermont\u0027s Luskan. If Drizzt saw through his disguise, the drow hid it well. \"Well met, King Bruenor, for all the tales I heared of ye,\" Athrogate greeted enthusiastically, coming forward to stand before the throne. \"I\u0027m hopin\u0027 that ye\u0027re not put out by me coming to see yerself directly, but if I\u0027m returning to me kinfolk without having had me say to yerself, then suren they\u0027d be chasing me out!\" \"And where might home be, good ...?\" \"Stuttgard,\" Athrogate replied. \"Stuttgard o\u0027 the Stone Hills Stuttgard Clan.\" Bruenor looked at him curiously and shook his head. \"South o\u0027 the Snowflakes, long south o\u0027 here,\" the dwarf bluffed. \"I am afraid that I know not of yer clan, or yer Stone Hills,\" said Bruenor. He glanced at Drizzt, who shrugged and shook his head. \"Well, we heared o\u0027 yerself,\" Athrogate replied. \"Many\u0027re the songs o\u0027 Mithral Hall sung in the Stone Hills!\" \"Good to know,\" Bruenor replied, then he prompted the emissary with a rolling motion of his hand, obviously in a rush to be done with the formalities. \"And ye\u0027re here to offer trade, perhaps? Or to set the grounds for an alliance?\" \"Nah,\" said Athrogate. \"Just a dwarf walkin\u0027 the world and wantin\u0027 to meet King Bruenor Battlehammer.\" The dwarf king nodded. \"Very well. And ye\u0027re wishing to remain with us in Mithral Hall for some time?\" Athrogate shrugged. \"Was heading east, to Adbar,\" he said. \"Got some family there. I was hopin\u0027 to come to Mithral Hall on me return back to the west, and not plannin\u0027 to stop through now. But on the road, I heared whispers about yer girl.\" That perked Bruenor up, and the drow behind him as well. \"What of me girl?\" Bruenor asked, suspicion thick in his voice. \"Heared on the road that she got touched by the falling Weave o\u0027 magic.\" \"Ye heared that, did ye?\" \"Aye, King Bruenor, so I thought I should come through as fast as me short legs\u0027d be taking me.\" \"Ye\u0027re a priest, then?\" \"Nah, just a scrapper.\" \"Then why? What? Have ye anything to offer me, Stuttgard o\u0027 the Stone Hills?\" Bruenor said, clearly agitated. \"A name, and one I think ye\u0027re knowin\u0027,\" said Athrogate. \"Human name o\u0027 Cadderly.\" Bruenor and Drizzt exchanged glances, then both stared hard at the visitor. \"His place\u0027s not too far from me home,\" Athrogate explained. \"I went right through it on me way here, o\u0027 hourse. Oh, but he\u0027s got a hunnerd wizards and priests in there now, all trying to get what\u0027s what, if ye get me meaning.\" \"What about him?\" Bruenor asked, obviously trying to remain calm but unable to keep the urgency out of his tone - or out of his posture, as he leaned forward in his throne. \"He and his been workin\u0027 on the problems,\" Athrogate explained. \"I thinked ye should know that more\u0027n a few that been brain-touched by the Weave\u0027ve gone in there, and most\u0027ve come out whole.\" Bruenor leaped up from his seat. \"Cadderly is curing those rendered foolish by the troubles?\" Athrogate shrugged. \"I thinked ye\u0027d want to be knowin\u0027.\" Bruenor turned fast to Drizzt. \"A month and more of hard travel,\" the drow warned. \"Magical items\u0027re working,\" Bruenor replied. \"We got the wagon me boys\u0027re building for Silverymoon journeys. We got the zephyr shoes ...\" Drizzt\u0027s eyes lit up at the reference, for indeed the dwarves of Clan Battlehammer had been working on a solution to their isolation, even before the onset of magical afflictions. Without the magical teleportation of their neighboring cities, or creations of magic like Lady Alustriel\u0027s flying chariots of fire, the dwarves had taken to a more mundane solution, constructing a wagon strong enough to handle the bumps and stones of treacherous terrain. They had sought out magical assistance for teams that might be pulling the vehicle. The drow was already starting off the dais before Bruenor could finish his sentence. \"On my way,\" Drizzt said. \"Can I wish ye all me best, King Bruenor?\" Athrogate asked. \"Stuttgard o\u0027 the Stone Hills,\" Bruenor repeated, and he turned to the court scribe. \"Write it down!\" \"Aye, me king!\" \"And know that if me girl finds peace in Spirit Soaring, that I\u0027ll be visiting yer clan, good friend,\" Bruenor said, looking back to Athrogate. \"And know that ye\u0027re fore\u0027er a friend o\u0027 Mithral Hall. Ye stay as long as ye\u0027re wantin\u0027, and all costs fall to meself! But beggin\u0027 yer pardon, the time\u0027s for me to be goin\u0027.\" He bowed fast and was running out of the room before Athrogate could even offer his thanks in reply. Full of energy and enthusiasm for the first time in a few long days, the hope-filled Drizzt and Bruenor charged down the hall toward Catti-brie\u0027s door. They slowed abruptly as they neared, seeing the sizzling purple and blue streaks of energy slipping through the cracks in the door. \"Bah, not again!\" Bruenor groaned. He beat Drizzt to the door and shoved it open. There was Catti-brie, standing in mid air above the bed, her arms out to her sides, her eyes rolled to white, trembling, trembling.... \"Me girl ...\" Bruenor started to say, but he bit back the words when he noted Regis against the far wall, curled up on the floor, his arms over his head. \"Elf!\" Bruenor cried, but Drizzt was already running to Catti-brie, grabbing her and pulling her down to the bed. Bruenor grumbled and cursed and rushed over to Regis. Catti-brie\u0027s stiffness melted as the fit ended, and she fell limp into Drizzt\u0027s arms. He eased her down to a sitting position and hugged her close, and only then did he notice the desperate Regis. The halfling flailed wildly at Bruenor, slapping the dwarf repeatedly and squirming away from Bruenor\u0027s reaching hands. Clearly terrified, he seemed to be looking not at the dwarf, but at some great monster. \"Rumblebelly, what\u0027re ye about?\" Bruenor asked. Regis screamed into the dwarf\u0027s face in response, a primal explosion of sheer terror. As Bruenor fell back, the halfling scrambled away, rising up to his knees, then to his feet. He ran headlong, face-first, into the opposite wall. He bounced back and fell with a groan. \"Oh, by the gods,\" said Bruenor, and he reached down and scooped something up from the floor. He turned to Drizzt and presented the item for the drow to see. It was the halfling\u0027s ruby pendant, the enchanted gemstone that allowed Regis to cast charms upon unwitting victims. Regis recovered from his self-inflicted wallop and leaped to his feet. He screamed again and ran past Bruenor, flailing his arms insanely. When Bruenor tried to intercept him, the halfling slapped him and punched him, pinched him and even bit him, and all the while Bruenor called to him, but Regis seemed not to hear a word. The dwarf might as well have been a demon or devil come to eat the little one for dinner. \"Elf!\" Bruenor called. Then he yelped and fell back, clutching his bleeding hand. Regis sprinted for the door. Drizzt beat him there, hitting him with a flying tackle that sent them both into a roll into the hall. In that somersault, Drizzt deftly worked his hands so that when they settled, he was behind Regis, his legs clamped around the halfling\u0027s waist, his arms knifed under Regis\u0027s, turning and twisting expertly to tie the little one in knots. There was no way for Regis to break out, to hit Drizzt, or to squirm away from him. But that hardly slowed his frantic gyrations, and didn\u0027t stop him from screaming insanely. The hallway began to fill with curious dwarves. \"Ye got a pin stuck in the little one\u0027s arse, elf?\" one asked. \"Help me with him!\" Drizzt implored. The dwarf came over and reached for Regis, then quickly retracted his hand when the halfling tried to bite it. \"What in the Nine Hells?\" \"Just ye take him!\" Bruenor yelled from inside the room. \"Ye take him and tie him down - and don\u0027t ye be hurting him!\" \"Yes, me king!\" It took a long time, but finally the dwarves dragged the thrashing Regis away from Drizzt. \"I could slug him and put him down quiet,\" one offered, but Drizzt\u0027s scowl denied that course of action. \"Take him to his chamber and keep him safe,\" the drow said. He went back into the room, closing the door behind him. \"She didn\u0027t even notice,\" Bruenor explained as Drizzt sat on the bed beside Catti-brie. \"She\u0027s not knowing she world around her.\" \"We knew that,\" Drizzt reminded. \"Not even a bit! Nor\u0027s the little one now.\" Drizzt shrugged. \"Cadderly,\" he reminded the dwarf king. \"For both o\u0027 them,\" said the dwarf, and he looked at the door. \"Rumblebelly used the ruby on her.\" \"To try to reach her,\" Drizzt agreed. \"But she reached him instead,\" the dwarf said.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-ghost-king-transitions-3/page-6.html","bookId":2189,"book":{"id":2189,"title":"The Ghost King (Transitions #3)","description":"Storyline: The Ghost King (Transitions #3) Don\u0027t miss the gripping conclusion to Salvatore\u0027s New York Times best-selling Transitions trilogy!
