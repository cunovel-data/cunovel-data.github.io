The voice remained clear in his mind, invading his moment of quiet Reverie.\\n\\n He knew the voice, for with it came an image of catastrophe all too clear in his memories, from perhaps a decade and a half before.\\n\\n He adjusted his eye patch and ran a hand over his bald head, trying to make sense of it. It couldn\u0027t be. The dragon had been destroyed, and nothing, not even a great red wyrm like Hephaestus, could have survived the intensity of the blast when Crenshinibon had released its power. Or even if the beast had somehow lived, why hadn\u0027t it arisen then and there, where its enemies would have been helpless before it?\\n\\n No, Jarlaxle was certain that Hephaestus had been destroyed. But he hadn\u0027t dreamed the intrusion into his Reverie. Of that, too, Jarlaxle was certain.\\n\\n I will find you, drow.\\n\\n It had been Hephaestus - the telepathic impartation into Jarlaxle\u0027s Reverie had brought the image of the great dragon to him clearly. He could not have mistaken the weight of that voice. It had startled him from his meditation, and he had instinctively retreated from it and forced himself back into the present, to his physical surroundings.\\n\\n He regretted that almost immediately, and calmed long enough to hear the contented snoring of his dwarf companion, to ensure that all around him was secure, then he closed his eyes once more and turned his thoughts inward, to a place of meditation and solitude.\\n\\n Except, he was not alone.\\n\\n Hephaestus was there waiting for him. He envisioned the dragon\u0027s eyes, twin flickers of angry flame. He could feel the beast\u0027s rage, simmering and promising revenge. A contented growl rumbled through Jarlaxle\u0027s thoughts, the smirk of the predator when the prey was at hand. The dragon had found him telepathically, but did that mean it knew where he was physically?\\n\\n A moment of panic swept through Jarlaxle, a moment of confusion. He reached up and touched his eye patch, wearing it that day over his left eye. Its magic should have stopped Hephaestus\u0027s intrusion, should have shielded Jarlaxle from all scrying or unwanted telepathic contact. But he was not imagining it. Hephaestus was with him.\\n\\n I will find you, drow, the dragon assured him once more.\\n\\n \"Will\" find him, so therefore had not yet found him ...\\n\\n Jarlaxle threw up his defenses, refusing to consider his current whereabouts in the recognition of why Hephaestus kept repeating his declaration. The dragon wanted him to consider his position so the beast could telepathically take the knowledge of his whereabouts from him.\\n\\n He filled his thoughts with images of the city of Luskan, of Calimport, of the Underdark. Jarlaxle\u0027s principal lieutenant in his powerful mercenary band was an accomplished psionicist, and had taught Jarlaxle much in the ways of mental trickery and defense. Jarlaxle brought every bit of that knowledge to bear.\\n\\n Hephaestus\u0027s psionically-imparted growl, turning from satisfaction to frustration, was met by Jarlaxle\u0027s chuckle. You cannot elude me, the dragon insisted. Aren\u0027t you dead? I will find you, drow! Then I will kill you again.\\n\\n Jarlaxle\u0027s matter-of-fact, casual response elicited a great rage from the beast - as the drow had hoped - and with that emotion came a momentary loss of control by the dragon, which was all Jarlaxle needed.\\n\\n He met that rage with a wall of denial, forcing Hephaestus from his thoughts. He shifted the eye patch to his right eye, his touch awakening the item, bringing forth its shielding power more acutely.\\n\\n That was the way with many of his magical trinkets of late. Something was happening to the wider world, to Mystra\u0027s Weave. Kimmuriel had warned him to beware the use of magic, for reports of disastrous results from even simple castings had become all too commonplace.\\n\\n The eye patch did its job, though, and combined with Jarlaxle\u0027s clever tricks and practiced defenses, Hephaestus was thrown far from the drow\u0027s subconscious.\\n\\n Eyes open once more, Jarlaxle surveyed his small encampment. He and Athrogate were north of Mirabar. The sun had not yet appeared, but the eastern sky was beginning to leak its pre-dawn glow. The two of them were scheduled to meet, clandestinely, with Marchion Elastul of Mirabar that very morning, to complete a trading agreement between the self-serving ruler and the coastal city of Luskan. Or more specifically, between Elastul and Bregan D\u0027aerthe, Jarlaxle\u0027s mercenary - and increasingly mercantile - band. Bregan D\u0027aerthe used the city of Luskan as a conduit to the World Above, trading goods from the Underdark for artifacts from the surface realms, ferrying valuable and exotic baubles to and from the drow city-state of Menzoberranzan.\\n\\n The drow scanned their camp, set in a small hollow amid a trio of large oaks. He could see the road, quiet and empty. From one of the trees a cicada crescendoed its whining song, and a bird cawed as if in answer. A rabbit darted through the small grassy lea on the downside of the camp, fleeing with sharp turns and great leaps as if terrified by the weight of Jarlaxle\u0027s gaze.\\n\\n The drow slipped down from the low crook in the tree, rolling off the heavy limb that had served as his bed. He landed silently on magical boots and wove a careful path out of the copse to get a wider view of the area.\\n\\n \"And where\u0027re ye goin\u0027, I\u0027m wantin\u0027 to be knowin\u0027?\" the dwarf called after him.\\n\\n Jarlaxle turned on Athrogate, who still lay on his back, wrapped in a tangled bedroll. One half-opened eye looked back at him.\\n\\n \"I often ponder which is more annoying, dwarf, your snoring or your rhyming.\"\\n\\n \"Meself, too,\" said Athrogate. \"But since I\u0027m not much hearing me snoring, I\u0027ll be choosing the word-song.\"\\n\\n Jarlaxle just shook his head and turned to walk away. \"I\u0027m still asking, elf.\"\\n\\n \"I thought it wise to search the grounds before our esteemed visitor arrives,\" Jarlaxle replied.\\n\\n \"He\u0027ll be getting here with half the dwarfs o\u0027 Mirabar\u0027s Shield, not for doubting,\" said Athrogate.\\n\\n True enough, Jarlaxle knew. He heard Athrogate shuffle out of his bedroll and scramble to his feet.\\n\\n \"Prudence, my friend,\" the drow said over his shoulder, and started away.\\n\\n \"Nah, it\u0027s more\u0027n that,\" Athrogate declared.\\n\\n Jarlaxle laughed helplessly. Few in the world knew him well enough to so easily read through his tactical deflections and assertions, but in the years Athrogate had been at his side, he had indeed let the dwarf get to know something of the true Jarlaxle Baenre. He turned and offered a grin to his dirty, bearded friend.\\n\\n \"Well?\" Athrogate asked. \"Yer words I\u0027m taking, but what\u0027s got ye shaking?\"\\n\\n \"Shaking?\"\\n\\n Athrogate shrugged. \"It be what it be, and I see what it be.\"\\n\\n \"Enough,\" Jarlaxle bade him, holding his hands out in surrender.\\n\\n \"Ye tell me or I\u0027ll rhyme at ye again,\" the dwarf warned.\\n\\n \"Hit me with your mighty morningstars instead, I beg you.\"\\n\\n Athrogate planted his hands on his hips and stared at the dark elf hard.\\n\\n \"I do not yet know,\" Jarlaxle admitted. \"Something ...\" He reached around and retrieved his enormous, wide-brimmed hat, patted it into shape, and plopped it atop his head.\\n\\n \"Something?\"\\n\\n \"Aye,\" said the drow. \"A visitor, perhaps in my dreams, perhaps not.\"\\n\\n \"Tell me she\u0027s a redhead.\"\\n\\n \"Red scales, more likely.\"\\n\\n Athrogate\u0027s face crinkled in disgust. \"Ye need to dream better, elf.\"\\n\\n \"Indeed.\"\\n\\n \"My daughter fares well, I trust,\" Marchion Elastul remarked. He sat in a great, comfortable chair at the heavy, ornately decorated table his attendants had brought from his palace in Mirabar, surrounded by a dozen grim-faced dwarves of Mirabar\u0027s Shield. Across from him, in lesser thrones, sat Jarlaxle and Athrogate, who stuffed his face with bread, eggs, and all manner of delicacies. Even for a meeting in the wilderness, Elastul had demanded some manner of civilized discourse, which, to the dwarf\u0027s ultimate joy, had included a fine breakfast.\\n\\n \"Arabeth has adapted well to the changes in Luskan, yes,\" Jarlaxle answered. \"She and Kensidan have grown closer, and her position within the city continues to expand in prominence and power.\"\\n\\n \"That miserable Crow,\" Elastul whispered with a sigh, referring to High Captain Kensidan, one of the four high captains who ruled the city. He knew well that Kensidan had become the dominant member of that elite group.\\n\\n \"Kensidan won,\" Jarlaxle reminded him. \"He outwitted Arklem Greeth and the Arcane Brotherhood - no small feat! - and convinced the other high captains that his course was the best.\"\\n\\n \"I would have preferred Captain Deudermont.\"\\n\\n Jarlaxle shrugged. \"This way is more profitable for us all.\"\\n\\n \"To think that I\u0027m sitting here dealing with a drow elf,\" Elastul lamented. \"Half of my Shield dwarves would prefer that I kill you rather than negotiate with you.\"\\n\\n \"That would not be wise.\"\\n\\n \"Or profitable?\"\\n\\n \"Nor healthy.\"\\n\\n Elastul snorted, but his daughter Arabeth had told him enough about the creature Jarlaxle for him to know that the drow\u0027s quip was only half a joke, and half a deadly serious threat.\\n\\n \"If Kensidan the Crow and the other three high captains learn of our little arrangement here, they will not be pleased,\" Elastul said.\\n\\n \"Bregan D\u0027aerthe does not answer to Kensidan and the others.\"\\n\\n \"But you do have an arrangement with them to trade your goods through their markets alone.\"\\n\\n \"Their wealth grows considerably because of the quiet trade with Menzoberranzan,\" Jarlaxle replied. \"If I decide it convenient to do some dealing outside the parameters of that arrangement, then ... I am a merchant, after all.\"\\n\\n \"A dead one, should Kensidan learn of this.\"\\n\\n Jarlaxle laughed at the assertion. \"A weary one, more likely, for what shall I do with a surface city to rule?\"\\n\\n It took a moment for the implications of that boast to sink in to Elastul, and the possibility brought him little amusement, for it served as a reminder and a warning that he dealt with dark elves.\\n\\n Very dangerous dark elves.\\n\\n \"We have a deal, then?\" Jarlaxle asked.\\n\\n \"I will open the tunnel to Barkskin\u0027s storehouse,\" Elastul replied, referring to a secret marketplace in the Undercity of Mirabar, the dwarf section. \"Kimmuriel\u0027s wagons can move in through there alone, and none shall be allowed beyond the entry hall. And I expect the pricing exactly as we discussed, since the cost to me in merely keeping the appropriate guards alert for drow presence will be no small matter.\"\\n\\n \"\u0027Drow presence?\u0027 Surely you do not expect that we will deign to move further into your city, good marchion. We are quite content with the arrangement we have now, I assure you.\"\\n\\n \"You are a drow, Jarlaxle. You are never \u0027quite content.\u0027\"\\n\\n Jarlaxle simply laughed, unwilling and unable to dispute that point. He had agreed to personally broker the deal for Kimmuriel, who would oversee the set-up of the operation, since Jarlaxle\u0027s wanderlust had returned and he wanted some time away from Luskan. In truth, Jarlaxle had to admit to himself that he wouldn\u0027t really be surprised at all to return to the North after a few months on the road and find Kimmuriel making great inroads in the city of Mirabar, perhaps even becoming the true power in the city, using Elastul or whatever other fool he might prop up to give him cover.\\n\\n Jarlaxle tipped his great hat, then, and rose to leave, signaling Athrogate to follow. Snorting like a pig on a truffle, the dwarf kept stuffing his mouth, egg yolk and jam splattering his great black beard, a braided and dung-tipped mane.\\n\\n \"It has been a long and hungry road,\" Jarlaxle commented to Elastul. The marchion shook his head in disgust. The dwarves of Mirabar\u0027s Shield, however, looked on with pure jealousy.\\n\\n Jarlaxle and Athrogate had marched more than a mile before the dwarf stopped belching long enough to ask, \"So, we\u0027re back for Luskan?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" Jarlaxle replied. \"Kimmuriel will see to the more mundane details now that I have completed the deal.\"\\n\\n \"Long way to ride for a short talk and a shorter meal.\"\\n\\n \"You ate through half the morning.\"\\n\\n Athrogate rubbed his considerable belly and issued a belch that scared a flock of birds from a nearby tree, and Jarlaxle gave a helpless shake of his head.\\n\\n \"My tummy hurts,\" the dwarf explained. He rubbed his belly and burped again, several times in rapid succession. \"So we\u0027re not back to Luskan. Where, then?\"\\n\\n That question gave Jarlaxle pause. \"I am not sure,\" he said honestly.\\n\\n \"I won\u0027t be missing the place,\" said Athrogate. He reached over his shoulder and patted the grip of one of his mighty glassteel morningstars, which he kept strapped diagonally on his back, handles up high, their spiked ball heads bouncing behind his shoulders as he bobbed along the trail. \"Ain\u0027t used these in months.\"\\n\\n Jarlaxle, staring absently into the distance, simply nodded.\\n\\n \"Well, wherever we\u0027re to go, if even ye\u0027re to know, I\u0027m thinkin\u0027 and talkin\u0027, it\u0027s better ridin\u0027 than walkin\u0027. Bwahaha!\" He reached into a belt pouch where he kept a black figurine of a war boar that could summon a magical mount to his side. He started to take it out, but Jarlaxle put a hand over his and stopped him.\\n\\n \"Not today,\" the drow explained. \"Today, we meander.\"\\n\\n \"Bah, but I\u0027m wantin\u0027 a bumpy road to shake a few belches free, ye damned elf.\"\\n\\n \"Today we walk,\" Jarlaxle said with finality.\\n\\n Athrogate looked at him with suspicion. \"So ye\u0027re not for knowin\u0027 where we\u0027re to be goin\u0027.\"\\n\\n The drow looked around at the rough terrain and rubbed his slender chin. \"Soon,\" he promised.\\n\\n \"Bah! We could\u0027ve gone back into Mirabar for more food!\" Athrogate blanched as he finished, though, a rare expression indeed for the tough dwarf, for Jarlaxle fixed him with a serious and withering glare, one that reminded him in no uncertain terms who was the leader and who the sidekick.\\n\\n \"Good day for a walk!\" Athrogate exclaimed, and finished with a great belch.\\n\\n They set their camp only a few miles northeast of the field where they had met with Marchion Elastul, on a small ridge among a line of scraggly, short trees, many dead, others nearly leafless. Below them to the west loomed the remains of an old farm, or perhaps a small village, beyond a short rocky field splashed with flat, cut stones, most lying but some standing on end, leading Athrogate to mutter that it was probably an old graveyard.\\n\\n \"That or a pavilion,\" Jarlaxle replied, hardly caring.\\n\\n Selune was up, dancing in and out of the many small clouds that rushed overhead. Under her pale glow, Athrogate was soon snoring contentedly, but for Jarlaxle, the thought of Reverie was not welcomed.\\n\\n He watched as the shadows under the moon\u0027s pale glow began to shrink, disappear, then stretch toward the east as the moon passed overhead and started its western descent. Weariness crept in upon him, and he resisted it for a long while.\\n\\n The drow silently berated himself for his foolishness. He couldn\u0027t stay present and alert forever.\\n\\n He leaned against a dead tree, a twisted silhouette whose shadow looked like the skeleton of a man who reached, pleading, to the gods. Jarlaxle didn\u0027t climb it - the old tree likely wouldn\u0027t have held his weight - but instead remained standing, leaning against the rough trunk.\\n\\n He let his mind fall away from his surroundings, let it fall inward. Memories blended with sensations in the gentle swirl of Reverie. He felt his own heartbeat, the blood rushing through his veins. He felt the rhythms of the world, like a gentle breathing beneath his feet, and he embraced the sensation of a connection to the earth, as if he had grown roots into the deep rock. At the same time, he experienced a sensation of weightlessness, as if he were floating, as the wonderful relaxation of Reverie swept through his mind and body.\\n\\n Only there was Jarlaxle free. Reverie was his refuge. I will find you, drow.\\n\\n Hephaestus was there with him, waiting for him. In his mind, Jarlaxle saw again the fiery eyes of the beast, felt the hot breath and the hotter hatred. Be gone. You have no quarrel with me, the dark elf silently replied. I have not forgotten!\\n\\n \u0027Twas your own breath that broke the shard, Jarlaxle reminded the creature. Through your trickery, clever drow. I have not forgotten. You blinded me, you weakened me, you destroyed me!\\n\\n That last clause struck Jarlaxle as odd, not just because the dragon obviously wasn\u0027t destroyed, but because he still had the distinct feeling that it wasn\u0027t Hephaestus he was communicating with - but it was Hephaestus!\\n\\n Another image came into Jarlaxle\u0027s thoughts, that of a bulbous-headed creature with tentacles waving menacingly from its face.\\n\\n I know you. I will find you, the dragon went on. You who stole from me the pleasures of life and the flesh. You who stole from me the sweet taste of food and the pleasure of touch.\\n\\n So the dragon is dead, Jarlaxle thought.\\n\\n Not I! Him! the voice that resonated like Hephaestus roared in his mind. I was blind, and slept in darkness! Too intelligent for death! Consider the enemies you have made, drow! Consider that a king will find you - has found you!\\n\\n That last thought came through with such ferocity and such terrible implications that it startled Jarlaxle from his Reverie. He glanced around frantic, as if expecting a dragon to swoop down upon him and melt his camp into the dirt with an explosion of fiery breath, or an illithid to materialize and blast him with psionic energy that would scramble his mind forever.\\n\\n But the night was quiet under the moon\u0027s pale glow.\\n\\n Too quiet, Jarlaxle believed, like the hush of a predator. Where were the frogs, the night birds, the beetles?\\n\\n Something shifted down to the west, catching Jarlaxle\u0027s attention. He scanned the field, seeking the source - a rodent of some sort, likely.\\n\\n But he saw nothing, just the uneven grasses dancing in the moonlight on the gentle night breeze.\\n\\n Something moved again, and Jarlaxle swept his gaze across the abandoned stones littering the field, reached up and lifted his eye patch so he could more distinctly focus. Across the field stood a shadowy, huddled figure, bowing and waving its arms. It occurred to the drow that it was not a living man, but a wraith or a specter or a lich.\\n\\n In the open ground between them, a flat stone shifted. Another, standing upright, tilted to a greater angle.\\n\\n Jarlaxle took a step toward the ancient markers.\\n\\n The moon disappeared behind a dark cloud and the darkness deepened. But Jarlaxle was a creature of the Underdark, blessed with eyes that could see in the most meager light. In the nearly lightless caverns far below the stone, a patch of luminous lichen would glow to his eyes like a high-burning torch. Even in those moments when the moon hid, he saw that standing stone shift again, ever so slightly, as if something scrabbled at its base below the ground.\\n\\n \"A graveyard ...\" he whispered, finally recognizing the flat stones as markers and understanding Athrogate\u0027s earlier assessment. As he spoke, the moon came clear, brightening the field. Something churned in the dirt beside the shifting stone.\\n\\n A hand - a skeletal hand.\\n\\n A greenish blue crackle of strange ground lightning blasted tracers across the field. In that light, Jarlaxle saw many more stones shifting, the ground churning.\\n\\n I have found you, drow! the beast whispered in Jarlaxle\u0027s thoughts. \"Athrogate,\" Jarlaxle called softly. \"Awaken, good dwarf.\" The dwarf snored, coughed, belched, and rolled to his side, his back to the drow.\\n\\n Jarlaxle slipped a hand crossbow from the holster on his belt, expertly drawing back the string with his thumb as he moved. He focused on a particular type of bolt, blunted and heavy, and the magical pouch beside the holster dispensed it into his hand as he reached for it.\\n\\n \"Awaken, good dwarf,\" the drow said again, never taking his gaze from the field. A skeletal arm grasped at the empty air near the low-leaning headstone.\\n\\n When Athrogate did not reply, Jarlaxle leveled the hand crossbow and pulled the trigger.\\n\\n \"Hey, now, what\u0027s the price o\u0027 bacon!\" the dwarf yelped as the bolt thumped him in the arse. He rolled over and scrambled like a tipped crab, but jumped to his feet. He began circling back and forth with short hops on bent legs, rubbing his wounded bum all the while.\\n\\n \"What do ye know, elf?\" he asked at length.\\n\\n \"That you are indeed loud enough to wake the dead,\" Jarlaxle replied, motioning over Athrogate\u0027s shoulder toward the stone-strewn field. Athrogate leaped around.\\n\\n \"I see ... dark,\" he said. As he finished, not only did the moon break free of the clouds, but another strange lightning bolt arced over the field like a net of energy had been cast over it. In the flash, whole skeletons showed themselves, standing free of their graves and shambling toward the tree-lined ridge.\\n\\n \"Coming for us, I\u0027m thinking!\" Athrogate bellowed. \"And they look a bit hungry. More than a bit! Bwahaha! Starved, I\u0027d wager!\"\\n\\n \"Let us be gone from this place, and quickly,\" said Jarlaxle. He reached into his belt pouch and produced an obsidian statue of a gaunt horse with twists like fire around its hooves.\\n\\n Athrogate nodded and did likewise, producing his boar figurine.\\n\\n They both dropped their items and called forth their steeds together, an equine nightmare for Jarlaxle, snorting smoke and running on hooves of flame, and a demonic boar for Athrogate that radiated heat and belched the fire of the lower planes. Jarlaxle was first up in his seat, turning his mount to charge away, but he looked over his shoulder to see Athrogate take up his twin morningstars, leap upon the boar, and kick it into a squealing charge straight down at the graveyard.\\n\\n \"This way\u0027s faster!\" the dwarf howled, and he set the heavy balls of his weapons spinning at the ends of their chains on either side. \"Bwahaha!\"\\n\\n \"Oh, Lady Lolth,\" Jarlaxle groaned. \"If you sent this one to torment me, then know that I surrender, and just take him back.\"\\n\\n Athrogate charged straight down onto the field, the boar kicking and bucking. Another green flash lit up the stony meadow before him, showing dozens of walking dead climbing from the torn earth, lifting skeletal hands at the approaching dwarf.\\n\\n Athrogate bellowed all the louder and clamped his powerful legs tightly on the demon-boar. Seeming no less crazy than its bearded rider, the boar charged straight at the walking horde, and the dwarf sent his morningstars spinning. All around him they worked, heavy glassteel balls smashing against bone, breaking off reaching fingers and arms, shattering ribs with powerful swipes.\\n\\n The boar beneath him gored, kicked, and plowed through the mindless undead that closed in hungrily. Athrogate drove his heels in hard against the boar\u0027s flanks and it leaped straight up and brought forth the fires of the lower planes, a burst of orange flame blasting out beneath its hooves as it landed, boiling into a radius half again wider than the dwarf was tall and curling up in an eruption of flame. The grass all around Athrogate smoked, licks of flame springing to life on the taller clumps.\\n\\n While the flames bit at the nearest skeletons, they proved little deterrence to those coming from behind. The creatures closed, showing not the slightest sign of fear.\\n\\n An overhead swing from Athrogate brought a morningstar down atop a skull, exploding it in a puff of white powder. He swung his other morningstar in a wide sweep, back to front, clipping three separate reaching skeletal arms and taking them off cleanly.\\n\\n The skeletons seemed not to notice or care, and kept coming. Closing, always closing.\\n\\n Athrogate roared all the louder against the press, and increased the fury of his swings. He didn\u0027t need to aim. The dwarf couldn\u0027t have missed smashing bones if he tried. Clawing fingers reached out at him, grinning skulls snapped their jaws.\\n\\n Then the boar shrieked in pain. It hopped and sent out another circle of flames, but the unthinking skeletons seemed not to notice as their legs blackened. Clawing fingers raked the boar, sending it into a bucking frenzy, and Athrogate was thrown wide, clearing the front row of skeletons, but many more rushed at him as he fell.\\n\\n Jarlaxle hated this kind of fight. Most of his battle repertoire, both magical and physical, was designed to misdirect, to confuse, and to keep his opponent off-balance.\\n\\n You couldn\u0027t confuse a brainless skeleton or zombie.\\n\\n With a great sigh, Jarlaxle plucked the huge feather from his hat and threw it to the ground, issuing commands to the magical item in an arcane language. Almost immediately, with a great puff of smoke, the feather became a gigantic flightless bird, a diatryma, ten feet tall and with a neck as thick as a strong man\u0027s chest.\\n\\n Responding to Jarlaxle\u0027s telepathic commands, the monstrous bird charged onto the field and buffeted the undead with its short wings, pecking them to pieces with its powerful beak. The bird pushed through the throng of undead, kicking and buffeting and pecking with abandon. Every attack rattled a skeleton to pieces or smashed a skull to powder.\\n\\n But more rose from the torn soil, and they closed and clawed.\\n\\n On the side of the ridge, Jarlaxle casually slipped a ring onto his finger and drew a thin wand from his pack.\\n\\n He punched out with the ring and its magic extended and amplified his strike many times over, blowing a path of force through the nearest ranks of skeletons, sending bones flying every which way. A second punch shattered three others as they tried to close from his left flank.\\n\\n His immediate position secured, the drow lifted the wand, calling upon its powers to bring forth a burst of brilliantly shining light, warm and magical and ultimately devastating to the undead creatures.\\n\\n Unlike the flames of the magical boar, the wand\u0027s light could not be ignored by the skeletons. Where fire could but blacken their bones, perhaps wound them slightly, the magical light struck at the core of the very magic that gave them animation, countering the negative energy that had lifted them from the grave.\\n\\n Jarlaxle centered the burst in the area where Athrogate had fallen, and the dwarf\u0027s expected yelp of surprise and pain - pain from stinging eyes - sounded sweet to the drow.\\n\\n He couldn\u0027t help but laugh when the dwarf finally emerged from the rattle of collapsing skeletons.\\n\\n The fight, however, remained far from won. More and more skeletons continued to rise and advance.\\n\\n Athrogate\u0027s boar was gone, slain by the horde. The magic of the figurine could not produce another creature for several hours. Jarlaxle\u0027s bird, too, had fallen victim to slashing digits and was being torn asunder. The drow lifted his fingers to the band on his hat, where the nub of a new feather was beginning to sprout. But several days would pass before another diatryma could be summoned.\\n\\n Athrogate turned as if he meant to charge into another knot of skeletons, and Jarlaxle yelled, \"Get back here!\"\\n\\n Still rubbing his stinging eyes, the dwarf replied, \"There be more to hit, elf!\"\\n\\n \"I will leave you, then, and they will tear you apart.\"\\n\\n \"Ye\u0027re askin\u0027 me to run from a fight!\" Athrogate yelled as his morningstars pulverized another skeleton that reached for him with clawing hands.\\n\\n \"Perhaps the magic that raised these creatures will lift you up as a zombie,\" Jarlaxle said as he turned his nightmare around, facing up the ridge. Within a few heartbeats, he heard mumbling behind him as Athrogate approached. The dwarf huffed and puffed beside him, holding the onyx boar figurine and muttering.\\n\\n \"You cannot call another one now,\" Jarlaxle reminded him, extending a hand that Athrogate grasped.\\n\\n The dwarf settled behind the drow on the nightmare\u0027s back and Jarlaxle kicked the steed away, leaving the skeletons far, far behind. They rode hard, then more easily, and the dwarf began to giggle.\\n\\n \"What do you know?\" the drow asked, but Athrogate only bellowed with wild laughter.\\n\\n \"What?\" Jarlaxle demanded, but he couldn\u0027t spare the time to properly look back, and Athrogate sounded too amused to properly answer.\\n\\n When they finally reached a place where they could safely stop, Jarlaxle pulled up abruptly and turned around.\\n\\n There sat Athrogate, red-faced with laughter as he held a skeletal hand and forearm, the fingers still clawing in the air before him. Jarlaxle leaped from the nightmare, and when the dwarf didn\u0027t immediately follow, the drow dismissed the steed, sending Athrogate falling to the ground through an insubstantial swirl of black smoke.\\n\\n But Athrogate still laughed as he thumped to the ground, thoroughly amused by the animated skeletal arm.\\n\\n \"Be rid of that wretched thing!\" Jarlaxle said.\\n\\n Athrogate looked at him incredulously. \"Thought ye had more imagination, elf,\" he said. He hopped up and unstrapped his heavy breastplate. As soon as it fell aside, the dwarf reached over his shoulder with the still-clawing hand and gave a great sigh of pleasure as the fingers scratched his back. \"How long do ye think it\u0027ll live?\"\\n\\n \"Longer than you, I hope,\" the drow replied, closing his eyes and shaking his head helplessly. \"Not very long, I imagine.\"\\n\\n \"Bwahaha!\" Athrogate bellowed, then, \"Aaaaaaaah.\"\\n\\n \"The next time we face such creatures, I expect you to follow my lead,\" Jarlaxle said to Athrogate the next morning as the dwarf fiddled once more with his skeletal toy.\\n\\n \"Next time? What do ye know, elf?\"\\n\\n \"It was not a random event,\" the drow admitted. \"I have been visited, twice now, in my Reverie by a beast I had thought destroyed, but one that has somehow transcended death.\"\\n\\n \"A beast that brought up them skeletons?\"\\n\\n \"A great dragon,\" Jarlaxle explained, \"to the south of here and ...\" Jarlaxle paused, not really certain where Hephaestus\u0027s lair was. He had gone there, but magically with a teleportation spell. He knew the general features of that distant region, but not the specifics of the lair, though he thought of someone who would surely know the place. \"Near to the Snowflake Mountains,\" he finished. \"A great dragon whose thoughts can reach across hundreds of miles, it seems.\"\\n\\n \"Ye thinking we need to run farther?\"\\n\\n Jarlaxle shook his head. \"There are great powers I can enlist in defeating this creature.\"\\n\\n \"Hmm,\" said the dwarf.\\n\\n \"I just have to convince them not to kill us first.\"\\n\\n \"Hmm.\"\\n\\n \"Indeed,\" said the drow. \"A mighty priest named Cadderly, a Chosen of his god, who promised me death should I ever return.\"\\n\\n \"Hmm.\"\\n\\n \"But I will find a way.\"\\n\\n \"So ye\u0027re sayin\u0027, and so ye\u0027re prayin\u0027, but I\u0027m hoping I\u0027m not the one what\u0027ll be payin\u0027.\"\\n\\n Jarlaxle glared at the dwarf.\\n\\n \"Well, then ye can\u0027t be going back where ye\u0027re wanting - though I canno\u0027 be thinking why ye\u0027re wanting what ye\u0027re wantin\u0027! To go to a place where the dragons are hauntin\u0027!\"\\n\\n The glare melted into a groan.\\n\\n \"I know, I know,\" said Athrogate. \"No more word-songin\u0027. But that was a good one, what?\"\\n\\n \"Needs work,\" said the drow. \"Though considerably less so than your usual efforts.\"\\n\\n \"Hmm,\" said the dwarf, beaming with pride. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-ghost-king-transitions-3/page-3.html","bookId":2189,"book":{"id":2189,"title":"The Ghost King (Transitions #3)","description":"Storyline: The Ghost King (Transitions #3) \\n Don\u0027t miss the gripping conclusion to Salvatore\u0027s New York Times best-selling Transitions trilogy! \\n When the Spellplague ravages Faerûn, Drizzt and his companions are caught in the chaos.
