Her smile was infectious, and she reminded me of the kids working the booths on the first day of the Minnesota State Fair, all excited and enthusiastic. I wondered how she’d feel at the end of the season.\n I mentioned, as I maneuvered around tables to the stick, that we seemed to be her only customers.\n “It’s a late Monday evening in May,” she told me. “Weekends have been terrific since the fishing opener, and business will get even better next weekend when they open the bass season. But we don’t do much in the middle of the week until after the schools let out and people start taking vacations.”\n Made sense to me. I took a long pull of the beer.\n “Ask her,” Sykora called from the map.\n “Ask what?” said the bartender.\n “We’re looking for the cabin of a couple of guys we know on Whitefish.” I attempted to sound more casual about it than Sykora did. “Only the directions they gave us aren’t the best. We’re wondering if you can help us out.”\n “Sure. Who are you talking about?”\n “Danny and Bruce Fuches.”\n “Oh, them.” The smile flickered on her face like a lightbulb that wasn’t sure if it was going to burn out.\n “Have you seen them around?” I asked.\n “They were in earlier, Bruce and some fat guy thinks he’s clever, kept insulting my resort.”\n “What does he have against this place?” I asked. “This place is great.”\n The bartender’s smile returned to full wattage.\n “Not just here. Minnesota in general.”\n “Jerk,” I said and drank more beer.\n “He wanted to use the phone, then got all bent outta shape because he thought I was listening to his conversation. I mean, who cares?”\n “Some people’s children,” I said.\n Sykora stood next to the wall map. He looked amped as if he wanted to run across the room, leap over the bar, and shake the woman by her shoulders. Instead, he asked in a calm voice, “Do you know where we can find them?”\n “Well, here,” the bartender said. She rounded the bar and walked to where Sykora was standing. She stood in front of the map, biting her lower lip while she studied it, then raised a long, delicate finger and pointed at a red square.\n “That’s us,” she said. “Here.” She moved the finger about two inches to the left. “This is the Fuches cabin, at the very end of Little Whitefish Lake Road. Used to belong to old man Sevier. Now, he was a sweetheart.”\n “How do we get there?” Sykora asked.\n “All this between us and them, where Fuches is, all this is steep hills and rocks. So what you need to do, you need to swing way around here”—using her finger as a pointer, the bartender traced a convoluted series of roads—“to here and then drive across to here. This is Little Whitefish Lake Road, where the cabin is. But you want to be careful you don’t take Whitefish Lake Road by mistake, because that’ll take you to way the heck over here.”\n Sykora looked like he was already lost.\n “What’s this?” I traced a thin line that extended directly from the resort to a spot on Little Whitefish Lake Road just short of the Fuches cabin.\n “That’s a footpath, a trail.”\n “Will the path take us to the Fuches cabin?” I asked.\n “Uh-huh. If you don’t mind the walk. See, what a lot of people do, instead of driving out of their way to get here, to get to my place—I have a very nice dinner menu—what they’ll do, they’ll take this trail through the steep hills and rocks and some swamp, too. It’s a nice walk. Couple times a year, we go over, cut down the growth, keep it nice.”\n “We can walk there from here?” Sykora said.\n “Sure. It’s about, I don’t know, a little over a half mile. It’s dark out, but just stay on the trail and you’ll be all right.”\n “Mind if we leave our car in your lot?” I asked.\n “No problem.”\n We walked single file down the narrow path. We had flashlights but didn’t dare use them, instead relying on the modest amount of moonlight that managed to penetrate the overcast sky. It didn’t show us much, but it was enough to keep us from straying off into the thick brush that hugged both sides of the trail. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/tin-city-mac-mckenzie-2/page-82.html","bookId":2224,"book":{"id":2224,"title":"Tin City (Mac McKenzie #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Mac McKenzie is rich. So rich that he\u0027s left his job as a Twin Cities police officer and spends his time doing favors large and small for friends. So when an old Marine buddy of his father\u0027s calls with a request Mac takes the time to help him out. And it is one of the stranger favors he\u0027s ever been asked: the elderly Mr. Mosley, a beekeeper, wants Mac to find out why his bees are suddenly dying in droves. \n Mac does some digging and before long turns up a hornet\u0027s nest of trouble in the person of Frank Crosetti, a new neighbor on the property abutting Mosley\u0027s bees. What started out as an innocent investigation into some unregulated pesticide quickly turns lethal. Crosetti sticks around long enough to make some very specific threats, then disappears into the wind leaving behind a vicious rape, a lifeless body, and a very angry McKenzie bursting for someone to blame. \n With only the faintest of trails to follow and a suspicious group of federal agents gunning for him, Mac dives underground, taking only a stash of cash and a small arsenal with him on his undercover mission. Before long Mac\u0027s deep in the forgotten corners of Minneapolis sniffing for any sign of Crosetti, unable to rest until he gets results. Combining engaging humor and wit with action-packed storytelling, Edgar Winner David Housewright\u0027s second Mac McKenzie novel is clever, compelling, and thoroughly enjoyable.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/tin-city-mac-mckenzie-2.jpg","author":"David Housewright","type":"Thriller","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/tin-city-mac-mckenzie-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:28 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:52:58 PM"}}
