She wore glasses.”\n “I remember those, too.”\n “What was her name?”\n “Rose, Rosemary, Roseanne …”\n “Roseanne Esmae.”\n “No. Esjay. Roseanne Esjay.”\n “She’s the one who labeled Minneapolis ‘Murderopolis.’”\n “What about her?”\n “Nothing. I was just trying to remember her name.”\n “That’s the only reason you called?”\n “Well, you could do me another favor.”\n “What?”\n “Look up the phone number of the New York Times.”\n I bought a fifteen-minute phone card at the drugstore and wasted six of them first trying to get through to Roseanne Esjay and then reminding her who I was.\n “The St. Paul cop with the goofy name, I remember now. How’s your cute friend?”\n “My married cute friend?”\n “Yeah, him.”\n “He’s good.”\n I was surprised that Esjay was in the office on a Sunday morning and told her so.\n “Trust me,” she said. “It wasn’t my idea. So, what can I do for you?”\n “I’m looking for information.”\n “About what?”\n “Some big fat slob named Frank Russo might’ve been a capo in the Bonanno family. My take is that he’s hiding from Angelo Granata. I don’t know why.”\n “Are you still with the St. Paul cops?”\n “No.”\n “Are you with the FBI now, or some other …”\n “Not at all. Why do you ask?”\n “I’m trying to figure out what you have to do with Frank Russo.”\n “I’m looking for him.”\n “So is most of the New York Mafia. Why do you want him?”\n “Are we on the record?”\n “Hell, yes, we’re on the record. McKenzie, why are you looking for Frank Russo?”\n “If we’re on the record, I can’t tell you.”\n “C’mon …”\n “Sorry.”\n “All right—look, off the record, then.”\n “Russo murdered a friend of mine.”\n “In Minnesota? Frank Russo’s in Minnesota?”\n “Yes.”\n “Where?”\n “I don’t know. The FBI is hiding him.”\n “The FBI is hiding—they must have turned him. They’re using Russo to get to Granata.”\n “That’s my understanding, too.”\n “Oh, man, this is great.”\n “I wouldn’t go so far as to say that.”\n “In Minnesota, you say. I’ll be damned. McKenzie, you need to go on the record. You need to—”\n “Roseanne, Roseanne …”\n “McKenzie.”\n “Roseanne, I don’t care what you write, as long as you don’t mention my name or why I’m looking for Russo. Is that a deal?”\n “What do I get in exchange?”\n “You get the name of the special agent who’s holding Russo’s hand.”\n “That’s a deal.”\n “Just tell me, first—why is Granata looking for Russo?”\n “It’s complicated.”\n I glanced at my watch. I still had a few minutes left on my phone card.\n “I have time,” I said.\n “Granata became acting boss of the Bonanno family when they busted Joseph Massino. He’s very good at what he does. Very disciplined. Under him the Bonannos have become the strongest of the five Mafia families. Frank Russo was one of Granata’s most dependable and ruthless capos. He wanted to use the Bonanno muscle to force the other families into a kind of European Union, five independent families but all of them under a single leadership umbrella—Granata’s umbrella. From a strictly business standpoint, it wasn’t a bad idea, only Russo’s plan probably would have led to all-out war, and Granata wouldn’t go along with it. Russo decided to take over the family and impose his union anyway. He tried to hit Granata. He missed. Now a hundred and fifty Bonanno soldiers are searching for him, plus God knows how many freelancers.”\n “That’s not complicated at all,” I told Roseanne.\n “It is if Russo cut a deal with the FBI. You say he’s in Minnesota?”\n “He was the last time I saw him.”\n “You saw him?”\n “I stood about two yards away from him.”\n “When?”\n “Last Friday afternoon. The day before he killed my friend.”\n “He killed your friend, but the FBI’s still protecting him?” \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/tin-city-mac-mckenzie-2/page-66.html","bookId":2224,"book":{"id":2224,"title":"Tin City (Mac McKenzie #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Mac McKenzie is rich. So rich that he\u0027s left his job as a Twin Cities police officer and spends his time doing favors large and small for friends. So when an old Marine buddy of his father\u0027s calls with a request Mac takes the time to help him out. And it is one of the stranger favors he\u0027s ever been asked: the elderly Mr. Mosley, a beekeeper, wants Mac to find out why his bees are suddenly dying in droves. \n Mac does some digging and before long turns up a hornet\u0027s nest of trouble in the person of Frank Crosetti, a new neighbor on the property abutting Mosley\u0027s bees. What started out as an innocent investigation into some unregulated pesticide quickly turns lethal. Crosetti sticks around long enough to make some very specific threats, then disappears into the wind leaving behind a vicious rape, a lifeless body, and a very angry McKenzie bursting for someone to blame. \n With only the faintest of trails to follow and a suspicious group of federal agents gunning for him, Mac dives underground, taking only a stash of cash and a small arsenal with him on his undercover mission. Before long Mac\u0027s deep in the forgotten corners of Minneapolis sniffing for any sign of Crosetti, unable to rest until he gets results. Combining engaging humor and wit with action-packed storytelling, Edgar Winner David Housewright\u0027s second Mac McKenzie novel is clever, compelling, and thoroughly enjoyable.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/tin-city-mac-mckenzie-2.jpg","author":"David Housewright","type":"Thriller","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/tin-city-mac-mckenzie-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:28 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:52:58 PM"}}
