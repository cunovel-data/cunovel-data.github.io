{"id":2397,"no":9,"title":"Chapter 9","content":"9:1 [hgb] 第 五 位 天 使 吹 号 ， 我 就 看 见 一 个 星 从 天 落 到 地 上 。 有 无 底 坑 的 钥 匙 赐 给 他 。 \n [kjv] And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit. \n [bbe] And at the sounding of the fifth angel I saw a star falling from heaven to the earth: and there was given to him the key of the great deep. \n 9:2 [hgb] 他 开 了 无 底 坑 ， 便 有 烟 从 坑 里 往 上 冒 ， 好 像 大 火 炉 的 烟 。 日 头 和 天 空 ， 都 因 这 烟 昏 暗 了 。 \n [kjv] And he opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a smoke out of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit. \n [bbe] And he made the great deep open and a smoke went up from it, like the smoke of a great oven; and the sun and the air were made dark because of the smoke. \n 9:3 [hgb] 有 蝗 虫 从 烟 中 出 来 飞 到 地 上 。 有 能 力 赐 给 它 们 ， 好 像 地 上 蝎 子 的 能 力 一 样 。 \n [kjv] And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth: and unto them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have power. \n [bbe] And from the smoke locusts came out on the earth; and power was given them, like the power of scorpions. \n 9:4 [hgb] 并 且 吩 咐 它 们 说 ， 不 可 伤 害 地 上 的 草 ， 和 各 样 青 物 ， 并 一 切 树 木 ， 惟 独 要 伤 害 额 上 没 有 神 印 记 的 人 。 \n [kjv] And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree; but only those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads. \n [bbe] And they were ordered to do no damage to the grass of the earth, or any green thing, or any tree, but only to such men as have not the mark of God on their brows. \n 9:5 [hgb] 但 不 许 蝗 虫 害 死 他 们 ， 只 叫 他 们 受 痛 苦 五 个 月 。 这 痛 苦 就 像 蝎 子 螫 人 的 痛 苦 一 样 。 \n [kjv] And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but that they should be tormented five months: and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion, when he striketh a man. \n [bbe] And orders were given them not to put them to death, but to give them great pain for five months: and their pain was as the pain from the wound of a scorpion. \n 9:6 [hgb] 在 那 些 日 子 ， 人 要 求 死 ， 决 不 得 死 。 愿 意 死 ， 死 却 远 避 他 们 。 \n [kjv] And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it; and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them. \n [bbe] And in those days men will be hoping for death, and it will not come to them; and they will have a great desire for death, and death will go in flight from them. \n 9:7 [hgb] 蝗 虫 的 形 状 ， 好 像 预 备 出 战 的 马 一 样 ， 头 上 戴 的 好 像 金 冠 冕 ， 脸 面 好 像 男 人 的 脸 面 。 \n [kjv] And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared unto battle; and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold, and their faces were as the faces of men. \n [bbe] And the forms of the locusts were like horses made ready for war; and on their heads they had crowns like gold, and their faces were as the faces of men. \n 9:8 [hgb] 头 发 像 女 人 的 头 发 ， 牙 齿 像 狮 子 的 牙 齿 。 \n [kjv] And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as the teeth of lions. \n [bbe] And they had hair like the hair of women, and their teeth were as the teeth of lions. \n 9:9 [hgb] 胸 前 有 甲 ， 好 像 铁 甲 。 它 们 翅 膀 的 声 音 ， 好 像 许 多 车 马 奔 跑 上 阵 的 声 音 。 \n [kjv] And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron; and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle. \n [bbe] And they had breastplates like iron, and the sound of their wings was as the sound of carriages, like an army of horses rushing to the fight. \n 9:10 [hgb] 有 尾 巴 像 蝎 子 。 尾 巴 上 的 毒 钩 能 伤 人 五 个 月 。 \n [kjv] And they had tails like unto scorpions, and there were stings in their tails: and their power was to hurt men five months. \n [bbe] And they have pointed tails like scorpions; and in their tails is their power to give men wounds for five months. \n 9:11 [hgb] 有 无 底 坑 的 使 者 作 它 们 的 王 。 按 着 希 伯 来 话 ， 名 叫 亚 巴 顿 ， 希 利 尼 话 ， 名 叫 亚 玻 伦 。 \n [kjv] And they had a king over them, which is the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue hath his name Apollyon. \n [bbe] They have over them as king the angel of the great deep: his name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in the Greek language Apollyon. \n 9:12 [hgb] 第 一 样 灾 祸 过 去 了 ， 还 有 两 样 灾 祸 要 来 。 \n [kjv] One woe is past; and, behold, there come two woes more hereafter. \n [bbe] The first Trouble is past: see, there are still two Troubles to come. \n 9:13 [hgb] 第 六 位 天 使 吹 号 ， 我 就 听 见 有 声 音 ， 从 神 面 前 金 坛 的 四 角 出 来 ， \n [kjv] And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God, \n [bbe] And at the sounding of the sixth angel a voice came to my ears from the horns of the gold altar which is before God, \n 9:14 [hgb] 吩 咐 那 吹 号 的 第 六 位 天 使 ， 说 ， 把 那 捆 绑 在 伯 拉 大 河 的 四 个 使 者 释 放 了 。 \n [kjv] Saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet, Loose the four angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates. \n [bbe] Saying to the sixth angel who had the horn, Make free the four angels who are chained at the great river Euphrates. \n 9:15 [hgb] 那 四 个 使 者 就 被 释 放 。 他 们 原 是 预 备 好 了 ， 到 某 年 某 月 某 日 某 时 ， 要 杀 人 的 三 分 之 一 。 \n [kjv] And the four angels were loosed, which were prepared for an hour, and a day, and a month, and a year, for to slay the third part of men. \n [bbe] And the four angels were made free, who were ready for the hour and day and month and year, that they might put to death a third part of men. \n 9:16 [hgb] 马 军 有 二 万 万 。 他 们 的 数 目 我 听 见 了 。 \n [kjv] And the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred thousand thousand: and I heard the number of them. \n [bbe] And the number of the armies of the horsemen was twice ten thousand times ten thousand: the number of them came to my ears. \n 9:17 [hgb] 我 在 异 象 中 看 见 那 些 马 和 骑 马 的 ， 骑 马 的 胸 前 有 甲 如 火 ， 与 紫 玛 瑙 ， 并 硫 磺 。 马 的 头 好 像 狮 子 头 ， 有 火 ， 有 烟 ， 有 硫 磺 ， 从 马 的 口 中 出 来 。 \n [kjv] And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and them that sat on them, having breastplates of fire, and of jacinth, and brimstone: and the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions; and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone. \n [bbe] And so I saw the horses in the vision, and those who were seated on them, having breastplates of fire and glass and of burning stone: and the heads of the horses were as the heads of lions; and out of their mouths came fire and smoke and a smell of burning. \n 9:18 [hgb] 口 中 所 出 来 的 火 ， 与 烟 ， 并 硫 磺 ， 这 三 样 灾 杀 了 人 的 三 分 之 一 。 \n [kjv] By these three was the third part of men killed, by the fire, and by the smoke, and by the brimstone, which issued out of their mouths. \n [bbe] By these evils a third part of men was put to death, by the fire, and the smoke, and the burning smell which came out of their mouths. \n 9:19 [hgb] 这 马 的 能 力 ， 是 在 口 里 ， 和 尾 巴 上 。 因 这 尾 巴 像 蛇 ， 并 且 有 头 用 以 害 人 。 \n [kjv] For their power is in their mouth, and in their tails: for their tails were like unto serpents, and had heads, and with them they do hurt. \n [bbe] For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails: because their tails are like snakes, and have heads, and with them they give wounds. \n 9:20 [hgb] 其 余 未 曾 被 这 些 灾 所 杀 的 人 ， 仍 旧 不 悔 改 自 己 手 所 作 的 ， 还 是 去 拜 鬼 魔 ， 和 那 些 不 能 看 ， 不 能 听 ， 不 能 走 ， 金 ， 银 ， 铜 ， 木 ， 石 ， 的 偶 像 。 \n [kjv] And the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not worship devils, and idols of gold, and silver, and brass, and stone, and of wood: which neither can see, nor hear, nor walk: \n [bbe] And the rest of the people, who were not put to death by these evils, were not turned from the works of their hands, but went on giving worship to evil spirits, and images of gold and silver and brass and stone and wood which have no power of seeing or hearing or walking: \n 9:21 [hgb] 又 不 悔 改 他 们 那 些 凶 杀 ， 邪 术 ， 奸 淫 ， 偷 窃 的 事 。 \n [kjv] Neither repented they of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts. \n [bbe] And they had no regret for putting men to death, or for their use of secret arts, or for the evil desires of the flesh, or for taking the property of others. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/171/2296.html","bookId":91,"book":{"id":91,"title":"启示录 Revelation","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 耶 稣 基 督 的 启 示 ， 就 是 神 赐 给 他 ， 叫 他 将 必 要 快 成 的 事 指 示 他 的 众 仆 人 。 他 就 差 遣 使 者 ， 晓 谕 他 的 仆 人 约 翰 。 [kjv] The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew unto his ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/171","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:15 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:30 AM"}}
