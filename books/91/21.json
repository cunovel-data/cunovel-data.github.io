And he said unto me, Write: for these words are true and faithful. \n [bbe] And he who is seated on the high seat said, See, I make all things new. And he said, Put it in the book; for these words are certain and true. \n 21:6 [hgb] 他 又 对 我 说 ， 都 成 了 。 我 是 阿 拉 法 ， 我 是 俄 梅 戛 ， 我 是 初 ， 我 是 终 。 我 要 将 生 命 泉 的 水 白 白 赐 给 那 口 渴 的 人 喝 。 \n [kjv] And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely. \n [bbe] And he said to me, It is done. I am the First and the Last, the start and the end. I will freely give of the fountain of the water of life to him who is in need. \n 21:7 [hgb] 得 胜 的 ， 必 承 受 这 些 为 业 。 我 要 作 他 的 神 ， 他 要 作 我 的 儿 子 。 \n [kjv] He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son. \n [bbe] He who overcomes will have these things for his heritage; and I will be his God, and he will be my son. \n 21:8 [hgb] 惟 有 胆 怯 的 ， 不 信 的 ， 可 憎 的 ， 杀 人 的 ， 淫 乱 的 ， 行 邪 术 的 ， 拜 偶 像 的 ， 和 一 切 说 谎 话 的 ， 他 们 的 分 就 在 烧 着 硫 磺 的 火 湖 里 。 这 是 第 二 次 的 死 。 \n [kjv] But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death. \n [bbe] But those who are full of fear and without faith, the unclean and takers of life, those who do the sins of the flesh, and those who make use of evil powers or who give worship to images, and all those who are false, will have their part in the sea of ever-burning fire which is the second death. \n 21:9 [hgb] 拿 着 七 个 金 碗 ， 盛 满 末 后 七 灾 的 七 位 天 使 中 ， 有 一 位 来 对 我 说 ， 你 到 这 里 来 ， 我 要 将 新 妇 ， 就 是 羔 羊 的 妻 ， 指 给 你 看 。 \n [kjv] And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with me, saying, Come hither, I will shew thee the bride, the Lamb\u0027s wife. \n [bbe] And one of the seven angels who had the seven vessels in which were the seven last punishments, came and said to me, Come here, and see the bride, the Lamb\u0027s wife. \n 21:10 [hgb] 我 被 圣 灵 感 动 ， 天 使 就 带 我 到 一 座 高 大 的 山 ， 将 那 由 神 那 里 从 天 而 降 的 圣 城 耶 路 撒 冷 指 示 我 。 \n [kjv] And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain, and shewed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God, \n [bbe] And he took me away in the Spirit to a great and high mountain, and let me see the holy town Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, \n 21:11 [hgb] 城 中 有 神 的 荣 耀 。 城 的 光 辉 如 同 极 贵 的 宝 石 ， 好 像 碧 玉 ， 明 如 水 晶 。 \n [kjv] Having the glory of God: and her light was like unto a stone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal; \n [bbe] Having the glory of God: and her light was like a stone of great price, a jasper stone, clear as glass: \n 21:12 [hgb] 有 高 大 的 墙 。 有 十 二 个 门 ， 门 上 有 十 二 位 天 使 。 门 上 又 写 着 以 色 列 十 二 个 支 派 的 名 字 。 \n [kjv] And had a wall great and high, and had twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel: \n [bbe] She had a wall great and high, with twelve doors, and at the doors twelve angels; and names on them, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel. \n 21:13 [hgb] 东 边 有 三 门 。 北 边 有 三 门 。 南 边 有 三 门 。 西 边 有 三 门 。 \n [kjv] On the east three gates; on the north three gates; on the south three gates; and on the west three gates. \n [bbe] And on the east were three doors; and on the north three doors; and on the south three doors; and on the west three doors. \n 21:14 [hgb] 城 墙 有 十 二 根 基 ， 根 基 上 有 羔 羊 十 二 使 徒 的 名 字 。 \n [kjv] And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb. \n [bbe] And the wall of the town had twelve bases, and on them the twelve names of the twelve Apostles of the Lamb. \n 21:15 [hgb] 对 我 说 话 的 拿 着 金 苇 子 当 尺 ， 要 量 那 城 ， 和 城 门 城 墙 。 \n [kjv] And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the city, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof. \n [bbe] And he who was talking with me had a gold measuring-rod to take the measure of the town, and of its doors, and its wall. \n 21:16 [hgb] 城 是 四 方 的 ， 长 宽 一 样 。 天 使 用 苇 子 量 那 城 ， 共 有 四 千 里 。 长 宽 高 都 是 一 样 。 \n [kjv] And the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve thousand furlongs. The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal. \n [bbe] And the town is square, as wide as it is long; and he took the measure of the town with the rod, one thousand and five hundred miles: it is equally long and wide and high. \n 21:17 [hgb] 又 量 了 城 墙 ， 按 着 人 的 尺 寸 ， 就 是 天 使 的 尺 寸 ， 共 有 一 百 四 十 四 肘 。 \n [kjv] And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred and forty and four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of the angel. \n [bbe] And he took the measure of its wall, one hundred and forty-four cubits, after the measure of a man, that is, of an angel. \n 21:18 [hgb] 墙 是 碧 玉 造 的 。 城 是 精 金 的 ， 如 同 明 净 的 玻 璃 。 \n [kjv] And the building of the wall of it was of jasper: and the city was pure gold, like unto clear glass. \n [bbe] And the building of its wall was of jasper, and the town was clear gold, clear as glass. \n 21:19 [hgb] 城 墙 的 根 基 是 用 各 样 宝 石 修 饰 的 。 第 一 根 基 是 碧 玉 。 第 二 是 蓝 宝 石 。 第 三 是 绿 玛 瑙 。 第 四 是 绿 宝 石 。 \n [kjv] And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished with all manner of precious stones.
