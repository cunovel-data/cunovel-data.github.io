and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which had the mark of the beast, and upon them which worshipped his image. \\n\\n [bbe] And the first went, and let what was in his vessel come down on the earth; and it became an evil poisoning wound on the men who had the mark of the beast, and who gave worship to his image. \\n\\n 16:3 [hgb] 第 二 位 天 使 把 碗 倒 在 海 里 ， 海 就 变 成 血 ， 好 像 死 人 的 血 ， 海 中 的 活 物 都 死 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea; and it became as the blood of a dead man: and every living soul died in the sea. \\n\\n [bbe] And the second let what was in his vessel come out into the sea; and it became blood as of a dead man; and every living thing in the sea came to an end. \\n\\n 16:4 [hgb] 第 三 位 天 使 把 碗 倒 在 江 河 与 众 水 的 泉 源 里 ， 水 就 变 成 血 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and fountains of waters; and they became blood. \\n\\n [bbe] And the third let what was in his vessel come out into the rivers and the fountains of water; and they became blood. \\n\\n 16:5 [hgb] 我 听 见 掌 管 众 水 的 天 使 说 ， 昔 在 今 在 的 圣 者 阿 ， 你 这 样 判 断 是 公 义 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And I heard the angel of the waters say, Thou art righteous, O Lord, which art, and wast, and shalt be, because thou hast judged thus. \\n\\n [bbe] And the voice of the angel of the waters came to my ears, saying, True and upright is your judging, O Holy One, who is and was from all time: \\n\\n 16:6 [hgb] 他 们 曾 流 圣 徒 与 先 知 的 血 ， 现 在 你 给 他 们 血 喝 。 这 是 他 们 所 该 受 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou hast given them blood to drink; for they are worthy. \\n\\n [bbe] For they made the blood of saints and prophets come out like a stream, and blood have you given them for drink; which is their right reward. \\n\\n 16:7 [hgb] 我 又 听 见 祭 坛 中 有 声 音 说 ， 是 的 ， 主 神 ， 全 能 者 阿 ， 你 的 判 断 义 哉 ， 诚 哉 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And I heard another out of the altar say, Even so, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous are thy judgments. \\n\\n [bbe] And a voice came from the altar, saying, Even so, O Lord God, Ruler of all, true and full of righteousness is your judging. \\n\\n 16:8 [hgb] 第 四 位 天 使 把 碗 倒 在 日 头 上 ， 叫 日 头 能 用 火 烤 人 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun; and power was given unto him to scorch men with fire. \\n\\n [bbe] And the fourth let what was in his vessel come out on the sun; and power was given to it that men might be burned with fire. \\n\\n 16:9 [hgb] 人 被 大 热 所 烤 ， 就 亵 渎 那 有 权 掌 管 这 些 灾 的 神 之 名 ， 并 不 悔 改 将 荣 耀 归 给 神 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And men were scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the name of God, which hath power over these plagues: and they repented not to give him glory. \\n\\n [bbe] And men were burned with great heat: and they said evil things against the name of the God who has authority over these punishments; and they were not turned from their evil ways to give him glory. \\n\\n 16:10 [hgb] 第 五 位 天 使 把 碗 倒 在 兽 的 座 位 上 ， 兽 的 国 就 黑 暗 了 。 人 因 疼 痛 就 咬 自 己 的 舌 头 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the beast; and his kingdom was full of darkness; and they gnawed their tongues for pain, \\n\\n [bbe] And the fifth let what was in his vessel come out on the high seat of the beast; and his kingdom was made dark; and they were biting their tongues for pain. \\n\\n 16:11 [hgb] 又 因 所 受 的 疼 痛 ， 和 生 的 疮 ， 就 亵 渎 天 上 的 神 。 并 不 悔 改 所 行 的 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores, and repented not of their deeds. \\n\\n [bbe] And they said evil things against the God of heaven because of their pain and their wounds; and they were not turned from their evil works. \\n\\n 16:12 [hgb] 第 六 位 天 使 把 碗 倒 在 伯 拉 大 河 上 ， 河 水 就 干 了 ， 要 给 那 从 日 出 之 地 所 来 的 众 王 预 备 道 路 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared. \\n\\n [bbe] And the sixth let what was in his vessel come out on the great river Euphrates; and it became dry, so that the way might be made ready for the kings from the east. \\n\\n 16:13 [hgb] 我 又 看 见 三 个 污 秽 的 灵 ， 好 像 青 蛙 ， 从 龙 口 兽 口 并 假 先 知 的 口 中 出 来 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet. \\n\\n [bbe] And I saw coming out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits, like frogs. \\n\\n 16:14 [hgb] 他 们 本 是 鬼 魔 的 灵 ， 施 行 奇 事 ， 出 去 到 普 天 下 众 王 那 里 ， 叫 他 们 在 神 全 能 者 的 大 日 聚 集 争 战 。 \\n\\n [kjv] For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty. \\n\\n [bbe] For they are evil spirits, working signs; who go out even to the kings of all the earth, to get them together to the war of the great day of God, the Ruler of all. \\n\\n 16:15 [hgb] （ 看 哪 ， 我 来 像 贼 一 样 。 那 儆 醒 ， 看 守 衣 服 ， 免 得 赤 身 而 行 ， 叫 人 见 他 羞 耻 的 ， 有 福 了 \\n\\n [kjv] Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his shame. \\n\\n [bbe] (See, I come as a thief. Happy is he who is watching and keeps his robes, so that he may not go unclothed, and his shame be seen.) \\n\\n 16:16 [hgb] 那 三 个 鬼 魔 便 叫 众 王 聚 集 在 一 处 ， 希 伯 来 话 叫 作 哈 米 吉 多 顿 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon. \\n\\n [bbe] And they got them together into the place which is named in Hebrew Armageddon. \\n\\n 16:17 [hgb] 第 七 位 天 使 把 碗 倒 在 空 中 ， 就 有 大 声 音 从 殿 中 的 宝 座 上 出 来 ， 说 ， 成 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, It is done. \\n\\n [bbe] And the seventh let what was in his vessel come out on the air; and there came out a great voice from the house of God, from the high seat, saying, It is done. \\n\\n 16:18 [hgb] 又 有 闪 电 ， 声 音 ， 雷 轰 ， 大 地 震 ， 自 从 地 上 有 人 以 来 ， 没 有 这 样 大 这 样 利 害 的 地 震 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, and so great. \\n\\n [bbe] And there were flames and voices and thunders; and there was a great earth-shock so that never, from the time when men were on the earth, had there been so great an earth-shock, so full of power. \\n\\n 16:19 [hgb] 那 大 城 裂 为 三 段 ， 列 国 的 城 也 都 倒 塌 了 。 神 也 想 起 巴 比 伦 大 城 来 ， 要 把 那 盛 自 己 烈 怒 的 酒 杯 递 给 他 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath. \\n\\n [bbe] And the great town was cut into three parts, and the towns of the nations came to destruction: and Babylon the great came into mind before God, to be given the cup of the wine of his wrath. \\n\\n 16:20 [hgb] 各 海 岛 都 逃 避 了 ， 众 山 也 不 见 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found. \\n\\n [bbe] And every island went in flight, and the mountains were seen no longer. \\n\\n 16:21 [hgb] 又 有 大 雹 子 从 天 落 在 人 身 上 ， 每 一 个 约 重 一 他 连 得 。 （ 一 他 连 得 约 有 九 十 斤 ） 为 这 雹 子 的 灾 极 大 ， 人 就 亵 渎 神 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every stone about the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great. \\n\\n [bbe] And great drops of ice, every one about the weight of a talent, came down out of heaven on men: and men said evil things against God because of the punishment of the ice-drops; for it is very great. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/171/2303.html","bookId":91,"book":{"id":91,"title":"启示录 Revelation","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 耶 稣 基 督 的 启 示 ， 就 是 神 赐 给 他 ， 叫 他 将 必 要 快 成 的 事 指 示 他 的 众 仆 人 。 他 就 差 遣 使 者 ， 晓 谕 他 的 仆 人 约 翰 。 [kjv] The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew unto his ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/171","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:15 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:30 AM"}}
