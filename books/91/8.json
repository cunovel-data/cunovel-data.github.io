{"id":2396,"no":8,"title":"Chapter 8","content":"8:1 [hgb] 羔 羊 揭 开 第 七 印 的 时 候 ， 天 上 寂 静 约 有 二 刻 。 [kjv] And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour. [bbe] And when the seventh stamp was undone there was quiet in heaven for about half an hour. 8:2 [hgb] 我 看 见 那 站 在 神 面 前 的 七 位 天 使 ， 有 七 枝 号 赐 给 他 们 。 [kjv] And I saw the seven angels which stood before God; and to them were given seven trumpets. [bbe] And I saw the seven angels who had their place before God; and seven horns were given to them. 8:3 [hgb] 另 有 一 位 天 使 拿 着 金 香 炉 ， 来 站 在 祭 坛 旁 边 。 有 许 多 香 赐 给 他 ， 要 和 众 圣 徒 的 祈 祷 一 同 献 在 宝 座 前 的 金 坛 上 。 [kjv] And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he should offer it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne. [bbe] And another angel came and took his place at the altar, having a gold vessel for burning perfume; and there was given to him much perfume, so that he might put it with the prayers of all the saints on the gold altar which was before the high seat. 8:4 [hgb] 那 香 的 烟 ， 和 众 圣 徒 的 祈 祷 ， 从 天 使 的 手 中 一 同 升 到 神 面 前 。 [kjv] And the smoke of the incense, which came with the prayers of the saints, ascended up before God out of the angel\u0027s hand. [bbe] And the smoke of the perfume, with the prayers of the saints, went up before God out of the angel\u0027s hand. 8:5 [hgb] 天 使 拿 着 香 炉 ， 盛 满 了 坛 上 的 火 ， 倒 在 地 上 。 随 有 雷 轰 ， 大 声 ， 闪 电 ， 地 震 。 [kjv] And the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire of the altar, and cast it into the earth: and there were voices, and thunderings, and lightnings, and an earthquake. [bbe] And the angel took the vessel; and he made it full of the fire of the altar, and sent it down on the earth: and there came thunders and voices and flames and a shaking of the earth. 8:6 [hgb] 拿 着 七 枝 号 的 七 位 天 使 ， 就 预 备 要 吹 。 [kjv] And the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound. [bbe] And the seven angels who had the seven horns made ready for sounding them. 8:7 [hgb] 第 一 位 天 使 吹 号 ， 就 有 雹 子 与 火 搀 着 血 丢 在 地 上 。 地 的 三 分 之 一 和 树 的 三 分 之 一 被 烧 了 ， 一 切 的 青 草 也 被 烧 了 。 [kjv] The first angel sounded, and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth: and the third part of trees was burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up. [bbe] And at the sounding of the first, a rain of ice and fire, mixed with blood, was sent on the earth: and a third part of the earth, and of the trees, and all green grass was burned up. 8:8 [hgb] 第 二 位 天 使 吹 号 ， 就 有 仿 佛 火 烧 着 的 大 山 扔 在 海 中 。 海 的 三 分 之 一 变 成 血 。 [kjv] And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea: and the third part of the sea became blood; [bbe] And at the sounding of the second angel, it was as if a great mountain burning with fire was sent into the sea: and a third part of the sea became blood, 8:9 [hgb] 海 中 的 活 物 死 了 三 分 之 一 。 船 只 也 坏 了 三 分 之 一 。 [kjv] And the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, and had life, died; and the third part of the ships were destroyed. [bbe] And destruction came on a third part of the living things which were in the sea, and on a third part of the ships. 8:10 [hgb] 第 三 位 天 使 吹 号 ， 就 有 烧 着 的 大 星 ， 好 像 火 把 从 天 上 落 下 来 ， 落 在 江 河 的 三 分 之 一 ， 和 众 水 的 泉 源 上 。 [kjv] And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from heaven, burning as it were a lamp, and it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters; [bbe] And at the sounding of the third angel, there went down from heaven a great star, burning like a flame, and it came on a third part of the rivers, and on the fountains of water. 8:11 [hgb] 这 星 名 叫 茵 陈 。 众 水 的 三 分 之 一 变 为 茵 陈 。 因 水 变 苦 ， 就 死 了 许 多 人 。 [kjv] And the name of the star is called Wormwood: and the third part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of the waters, because they were made bitter. [bbe] And the name of the star is Wormwood: and a third part of the waters became bitter; and a number of men came to their end because of the waters, for they were made bitter. 8:12 [hgb] 第 四 位 天 使 吹 号 ， 日 头 的 三 分 之 一 ， 月 亮 的 三 分 之 一 ， 星 辰 的 三 分 之 一 ， 都 被 击 打 。 以 致 日 月 星 的 三 分 之 一 黑 暗 了 ， 白 昼 的 三 分 之 一 没 有 光 ， 黑 夜 也 是 这 样 。 [kjv] And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars; so as the third part of them was darkened, and the day shone not for a third part of it, and the night likewise. [bbe] And at the sounding of the fourth angel, a third part of the sun, and of the moon, and of the stars was made dark, so that there was no light for a third part of the day and of the night. 8:13 [hgb] 我 又 看 见 一 个 鹰 飞 在 空 中 ， 并 听 见 它 大 声 说 ， 三 位 天 使 要 吹 那 其 余 的 号 ， 你 们 住 在 地 上 的 民 ， 祸 哉 ， 祸 哉 ， 祸 哉 。 [kjv] And I beheld, and heard an angel flying through the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, to the inhabiters of the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of the three angels, which are yet to sound! [bbe] And there came to my ears the cry of an eagle in flight in the middle of heaven, saying with a great voice, Trouble, trouble, trouble, to all on the earth, because of the other voices of the horns of the three angels, whose sounding is still to come.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/171/2295.html","bookId":91,"book":{"id":91,"title":"启示录 Revelation","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 耶 稣 基 督 的 启 示 ， 就 是 神 赐 给 他 ， 叫 他 将 必 要 快 成 的 事 指 示 他 的 众 仆 人 。 他 就 差 遣 使 者 ， 晓 谕 他 的 仆 人 约 翰 。 [kjv] The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew unto his ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/171","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:15 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:30 AM"}}
