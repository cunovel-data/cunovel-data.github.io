{"id":2399,"no":11,"title":"Chapter 11","content":"11:1 [hgb] 有 一 根 苇 子 赐 给 我 ， 当 作 量 度 的 杖 。 且 有 话 说 ， 起 来 ， 将 神 的 殿 ， 和 祭 坛 ， 并 在 殿 中 礼 拜 的 人 ， 都 量 一 量 。 [kjv] And there was given me a reed like unto a rod: and the angel stood, saying, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the altar, and them that worship therein. [bbe] And there was given to me a measuring rod: and one said, Go up and take the measure of the house of God, and the altar, and the worshippers in it. 11:2 [hgb] 只 是 殿 外 的 院 子 ， 要 留 下 不 用 量 。 因 为 这 是 给 了 外 邦 人 的 。 他 们 要 践 踏 圣 城 四 十 二 个 月 。 [kjv] But the court which is without the temple leave out, and measure it not; for it is given unto the Gentiles: and the holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months. [bbe] But do not take the measure of the space outside the house; because it has been given to the nations: and the holy town will be under their feet for forty-two months. 11:3 [hgb] 我 要 使 我 那 两 个 见 证 人 ， 穿 着 毛 衣 ， 传 道 一 千 二 百 六 十 天 。 [kjv] And I will give power unto my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days, clothed in sackcloth. [bbe] And I will give orders to my two witnesses, and they will be prophets for a thousand, two hundred and sixty days, clothed with haircloth. 11:4 [hgb] 他 们 就 是 那 两 棵 橄 榄 树 ， 两 个 灯 台 ， 立 在 世 界 之 主 面 前 的 。 [kjv] These are the two olive trees, and the two candlesticks standing before the God of the earth. [bbe] These are the two olive-trees and the two lights, which are before the Lord of the earth. 11:5 [hgb] 若 有 人 想 要 害 他 们 ， 就 有 火 从 他 们 口 中 出 来 ， 烧 灭 仇 敌 。 凡 想 要 害 他 们 的 ， 都 必 这 样 被 杀 。 [kjv] And if any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth, and devoureth their enemies: and if any man will hurt them, he must in this manner be killed. [bbe] And if any man would do them damage, fire comes out of their mouth and puts an end to those who are working against them: and if any man has a desire to do them damage, in this way will he be put to death. 11:6 [hgb] 这 二 人 有 权 柄 ， 在 他 们 传 道 的 日 子 叫 天 闭 塞 不 下 雨 ， 又 有 权 柄 叫 水 变 为 血 。 并 且 能 随 时 随 意 用 各 样 的 灾 殃 攻 击 世 界 。 [kjv] These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days of their prophecy: and have power over waters to turn them to blood, and to smite the earth with all plagues, as often as they will. [bbe] These have the power to keep the heaven shut, so that there may be no rain in the days when they are prophets: and they have power over the waters to make them into blood, and to send every sort of disease on the earth as their pleasure is. 11:7 [hgb] 他 们 作 完 见 证 的 时 候 ， 那 从 无 底 坑 里 上 来 的 兽 ， 必 与 他 们 交 战 ， 并 且 得 胜 ， 把 他 们 杀 了 。 [kjv] And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them. [bbe] And when they have come to the end of their witness, the beast which comes up out of the great deep will make war on them and overcome them and put them to death. 11:8 [hgb] 他 们 的 尸 首 就 倒 在 大 城 里 的 街 上 。 这 城 按 着 灵 意 叫 所 多 玛 ， 又 叫 埃 及 ， 就 是 他 们 的 主 钉 十 字 架 之 处 。 [kjv] And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified. [bbe] And their dead bodies will be in the open street of the great town, which in the spirit is named Sodom and Egypt, where their Lord was put to death on the cross. 11:9 [hgb] 从 各 民 各 族 各 方 各 国 中 ， 有 人 观 看 他 们 的 尸 首 三 天 半 ， 又 不 许 把 尸 首 放 在 坟 墓 里 。 [kjv] And they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and an half, and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves. [bbe] And the peoples and tribes and languages and nations will be looking on their dead bodies three days and a half, and will not let their dead bodies be put in the earth. 11:10 [hgb] 住 在 地 上 的 人 ， 就 为 他 们 欢 喜 快 乐 ， 互 相 馈 送 礼 物 。 因 这 两 位 先 知 曾 叫 住 在 地 上 的 人 受 痛 苦 。 [kjv] And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them, and make merry, and shall send gifts one to another; because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth. [bbe] And those who are on the earth will have pleasure and delight over them; and they will send offerings one to another because these two prophets gave great trouble to all on the earth. 11:11 [hgb] 过 了 这 三 天 半 ， 有 生 气 从 神 那 里 进 入 他 们 里 面 ， 他 们 就 站 起 来 。 看 见 他 们 的 人 甚 是 害 怕 。 [kjv] And after three days and an half the Spirit of life from God entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great fear fell upon them which saw them. [bbe] And after three days and a half the breath of life from God went into them, and they got up on their feet; and great fear came on those who saw them. 11:12 [hgb] 两 位 先 知 听 见 有 大 声 音 从 天 上 来 ， 对 他 们 说 ， 上 到 这 里 来 。 他 们 就 驾 着 云 上 了 天 。 他 们 的 仇 敌 也 看 见 了 。 [kjv] And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them, Come up hither. And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud; and their enemies beheld them. [bbe] And a great voice from heaven came to their ears, saying to them, Come up here. And they went up into heaven in the cloud, and were seen by those desiring their death. 11:13 [hgb] 正 在 那 时 候 ， 地 大 震 动 ， 城 就 倒 塌 了 十 分 之 一 。 因 地 震 而 死 的 有 七 千 人 。 其 余 的 都 恐 惧 ， 归 荣 耀 给 天 上 的 神 。 [kjv] And the same hour was there a great earthquake, and the tenth part of the city fell, and in the earthquake were slain of men seven thousand: and the remnant were affrighted, and gave glory to the God of heaven. [bbe] And in that hour there was a great earth-shock and a tenth part of the town came to destruction; and in the earth-shock seven thousand persons came to their end: and the rest were in fear, and gave glory to the God of heaven. 11:14 [hgb] 第 二 样 灾 祸 过 去 。 第 三 样 灾 祸 快 到 了 。 [kjv] The second woe is past; and, behold, the third woe cometh quickly. [bbe] The second Trouble is past: see, the third Trouble comes quickly. 11:15 [hgb] 第 七 位 天 使 吹 号 ， 天 上 就 有 大 声 音 说 ， 世 上 的 国 ， 成 了 我 主 和 主 基 督 的 国 。 他 要 作 王 ， 直 到 永 永 远 远 。 [kjv] And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign for ever and ever. [bbe] And at the sounding of the seventh angel there were great voices in heaven, saying, The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord, and of his Christ, and he will have rule for ever and ever. 11:16 [hgb] 在 神 面 前 ， 坐 在 自 己 位 上 的 二 十 四 位 长 老 ， 就 面 伏 于 地 敬 拜 神 ， [kjv] And the four and twenty elders, which sat before God on their seats, fell upon their faces, and worshipped God, [bbe] And the four and twenty rulers, who are seated before God on their high seats, went down on their faces and gave worship to God, saying, 11:17 [hgb] 说 ， 昔 在 今 在 的 主 神 ， 全 能 者 阿 ， 我 们 感 谢 你 ， 因 你 执 掌 大 权 作 王 了 。 [kjv] Saying, We give thee thanks, O LORD God Almighty, which art, and wast, and art to come; because thou hast taken to thee thy great power, and hast reigned. [bbe] We give you praise, O Lord God, Ruler of all, who is and who was; because you have taken up your great power and are ruling your kingdom. 11:18 [hgb] 外 邦 发 怒 ， 你 的 忿 怒 也 临 到 了 。 审 判 死 人 的 时 候 也 到 了 。 你 的 仆 人 众 先 知 ， 和 众 圣 徒 ， 凡 敬 畏 你 名 的 人 连 大 带 小 得 赏 赐 的 时 候 也 到 了 。 你 败 坏 那 些 败 坏 世 界 之 人 的 时 候 也 就 到 了 。 [kjv] And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that thou shouldest give reward unto thy servants the prophets, and to the saints, and them that fear thy name, small and great; and shouldest destroy them which destroy the earth. [bbe] And the nations were angry, and your wrath has come, and the time for the dead to be judged, and the time of reward for your servants, the prophets, and for the saints, and for those in whom is the fear of your name, small and great, and the time of destruction for those who made the earth unclean. 11:19 [hgb] 当 时 神 天 上 的 殿 开 了 ， 在 他 殿 中 现 出 他 的 约 柜 。 随 后 有 闪 电 ， 声 音 ， 雷 轰 ， 地 震 ， 大 雹 。 [kjv] And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in his temple the ark of his testament: and there were lightnings, and voices, and thunderings, and an earthquake, and great hail. [bbe] And the house of God which is in heaven was open; and the ark of his agreement was seen in his house, and there were flames and voices and thunders and an earth-shock and a rain of ice.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/171/2298.html","bookId":91,"book":{"id":91,"title":"启示录 Revelation","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 耶 稣 基 督 的 启 示 ， 就 是 神 赐 给 他 ， 叫 他 将 必 要 快 成 的 事 指 示 他 的 众 仆 人 。 他 就 差 遣 使 者 ， 晓 谕 他 的 仆 人 约 翰 。 [kjv] The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew unto his ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/171","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:15 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:30 AM"}}
