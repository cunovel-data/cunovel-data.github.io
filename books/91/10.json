[bbe] And he gave a loud cry, like the angry voice of a lion: and at his cry the voices of the seven thunders were sounding. 10:4 [hgb] 七 雷 发 声 之 后 ， 我 正 要 写 出 来 ， 就 听 见 从 天 上 有 声 音 说 ， 七 雷 所 说 的 你 要 封 上 ， 不 可 写 出 来 。 [kjv] And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered, and write them not. [bbe] And when the seven thunders had given out their voices, I was about to put their words down: and a voice from heaven came to my ears, saying, Keep secret the things which the seven thunders said, and do not put them in writing. 10:5 [hgb] 我 所 看 见 的 那 踏 海 踏 地 的 天 使 ， 向 天 举 起 右 手 来 ， [kjv] And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven, [bbe] And the angel which I saw taking his position on the sea and on the earth, put up his right hand to heaven, 10:6 [hgb] 指 着 那 创 造 天 和 天 上 之 物 ， 地 和 地 上 之 物 ， 海 和 海 中 之 物 ， 直 活 到 永 永 远 远 的 ， 起 誓 说 ， 不 再 有 时 日 了 。 （ 或 作 不 再 耽 延 了 ） [kjv] And sware by him that liveth for ever and ever, who created heaven, and the things that therein are, and the earth, and the things that therein are, and the sea, and the things which are therein, that there should be time no longer: [bbe] And took his oath by him who is living for ever and ever, who made the heaven and the things in it, and the earth and the things in it, and the sea and the things in it, that there would be no more waiting: 10:7 [hgb] 但 在 第 七 位 天 使 吹 号 发 声 的 时 候 ， 神 的 奥 秘 ， 就 成 全 了 ， 正 如 神 所 传 给 他 仆 人 众 先 知 的 佳 音 。 [kjv] But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished, as he hath declared to his servants the prophets. [bbe] But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when the sound of his horn is about to come, then will the secret of God be complete, of which he gave the good news to his servants the prophets. 10:8 [hgb] 我 先 前 从 天 上 所 听 见 的 那 声 音 ， 又 吩 咐 我 说 ， 你 去 把 那 踏 海 踏 地 之 天 使 手 中 展 开 的 小 书 卷 取 过 来 。 [kjv] And the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again, and said, Go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth. [bbe] And the voice came to me again from heaven, saying, Go, take the book which is open in the hand of the angel who has his place on the sea and on the earth. 10:9 [hgb] 我 就 走 到 天 使 那 里 ， 对 他 说 ， 请 你 把 小 书 卷 给 我 。 他 对 我 说 ， 你 拿 着 吃 尽 了 ， 便 叫 你 肚 子 发 苦 ， 然 而 在 你 口 中 要 甜 如 蜜 。 [kjv] And I went unto the angel, and said unto him, Give me the little book. And he said unto me, Take it, and eat it up; and it shall make thy belly bitter, but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey. [bbe] And I went to the angel, and said to him, Give me the little book. And he said to me: Put it in your mouth; and it will make your stomach bitter, but in your mouth it will be sweet as honey. 10:10 [hgb] 我 从 天 使 手 中 把 小 书 卷 接 过 来 ， 吃 尽 了 。 在 我 口 中 果 然 甜 如 蜜 。 吃 了 以 后 ， 肚 子 觉 得 发 苦 了 。 [kjv] And I took the little book out of the angel\u0027s hand, and ate it up; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey: and as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter. [bbe] And I took the little book out of the angel\u0027s hand and did as he said; and it was sweet as honey in my mouth: and when I had taken it, my stomach was made bitter. 10:11 [hgb] 天 使 （ 原 文 作 他 们 ） 对 我 说 ， 你 必 指 着 多 民 多 国 多 方 多 王 再 说 预 言 。 [kjv] And he said unto me, Thou must prophesy again before many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings. [bbe] And they said to me, You are to give word again of what is coming in the future to the peoples and nations and languages and kings.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/171/2297.html","bookId":91,"book":{"id":91,"title":"启示录 Revelation","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 耶 稣 基 督 的 启 示 ， 就 是 神 赐 给 他 ， 叫 他 将 必 要 快 成 的 事 指 示 他 的 众 仆 人 。 他 就 差 遣 使 者 ， 晓 谕 他 的 仆 人 约 翰 。 [kjv] The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew unto his ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/171","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:15 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:30 AM"}}
