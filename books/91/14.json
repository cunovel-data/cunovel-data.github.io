{"id":2402,"no":14,"title":"Chapter 14","content":"14:1 [hgb] 我 又 观 看 ， 见 羔 羊 站 在 锡 安 山 ， 同 他 又 有 十 四 万 四 千 人 ， 都 有 他 的 名 ， 和 他 父 的 名 ， 写 在 额 上 。 [kjv] And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and with him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his Father\u0027s name written in their foreheads. [bbe] And I saw the Lamb on the mountain of Zion, and with him a hundred and forty-four thousand, marked on their brows with his name and the name of his Father. 14:2 [hgb] 我 听 见 从 天 上 有 声 音 ， 像 众 水 的 声 音 ， 和 大 雷 的 声 音 。 并 且 我 所 听 见 的 好 像 弹 琴 的 所 弹 的 琴 声 。 [kjv] And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder: and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps: [bbe] And a voice from heaven came to my ears, like the sound of great waters, and the sound of loud thunder: and the voice which came to me was like the sound of players, playing on instruments of music. 14:3 [hgb] 他 们 在 宝 座 前 ， 并 在 四 活 物 和 众 长 老 前 唱 歌 ， 仿 佛 是 新 歌 。 除 了 从 地 上 买 来 的 那 十 四 万 四 千 人 以 外 ， 没 有 人 能 学 这 歌 。 [kjv] And they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and before the four beasts, and the elders: and no man could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand, which were redeemed from the earth. [bbe] And they made as it seemed a new song before the high seat, and before the four beasts and the rulers: and no man might have knowledge of the song but the hundred and forty-four thousand, even those from the earth whom God has made his for a price. 14:4 [hgb] 这 些 人 未 曾 沾 染 妇 女 ， 他 们 原 是 童 身 。 羔 羊 无 论 往 哪 里 去 ， 他 们 都 跟 随 他 。 他 们 是 从 人 间 买 来 的 ， 作 初 熟 的 果 子 归 与 神 和 羔 羊 。 [kjv] These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins. These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he goeth. These were redeemed from among men, being the firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb. [bbe] These are they who have not made themselves unclean with women; for they are virgins. These are they who go after the Lamb wherever he goes. These were taken from among men to be the first fruits to God and to the Lamb. 14:5 [hgb] 在 他 们 口 中 察 不 出 谎 言 来 。 他 们 是 没 有 瑕 疵 的 。 [kjv] And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault before the throne of God. [bbe] And in their mouth there was no false word, for they are untouched by evil. 14:6 [hgb] 我 又 看 见 另 有 一 位 天 使 飞 在 空 中 ， 有 永 远 的 福 音 要 传 给 住 在 地 上 的 人 ， 就 是 各 国 各 族 各 方 各 民 。 [kjv] And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people, [bbe] And I saw another angel in flight between heaven and earth, having eternal good news to give to those who are on the earth, and to every nation and tribe and language and people, 14:7 [hgb] 他 大 声 说 ， 应 当 敬 畏 神 ， 将 荣 耀 归 给 他 。 因 他 施 行 审 判 的 时 候 已 经 到 了 。 应 当 敬 拜 那 创 造 天 地 海 和 众 水 泉 源 的 。 [kjv] Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters. [bbe] Saying with a loud voice, Have fear of God and give him glory; because the hour of his judging is come; and give worship to him who made heaven and earth and the sea and the fountains of water. 14:8 [hgb] 又 有 第 二 位 天 使 ， 接 着 说 ， 叫 万 民 喝 邪 淫 大 怒 之 酒 的 巴 比 伦 大 城 倾 倒 了 ， 倾 倒 了 。 [kjv] And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen, is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink of the wine of the wrath of her fornication. [bbe] And a second angel came after, saying, Destruction has come to Babylon the great, which gave to all the nations the wine of the wrath of her evil ways. 14:9 [hgb] 又 有 第 三 位 天 使 ， 接 着 他 们 ， 大 声 说 ， 若 有 人 拜 兽 和 兽 像 ， 在 额 上 ， 或 在 手 上 ， 受 了 印 记 ， [kjv] And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his mark in his forehead, or in his hand, [bbe] And a third angel came after them, saying with a loud voice, If any man gives worship to the beast and his image, and has his mark on his brow or on his hand, 14:10 [hgb] 这 人 也 必 喝 神 大 怒 的 酒 ， 此 酒 斟 在 神 忿 怒 的 杯 中 纯 一 不 杂 。 他 要 在 圣 天 使 和 羔 羊 面 前 ， 在 火 与 硫 磺 之 中 受 痛 苦 。 [kjv] The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation; and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb: [bbe] To him will be given of the wine of God\u0027s wrath which is ready unmixed in the cup of his wrath and he will have cruel pain, burning with fire before the holy angels and before the Lamb: 14:11 [hgb] 他 受 痛 苦 的 烟 往 上 冒 ， 直 到 永 永 远 远 。 那 些 拜 兽 和 兽 像 受 他 名 之 印 记 的 ， 昼 夜 不 得 安 宁 。 [kjv] And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name. [bbe] And the smoke of their pain goes up for ever and ever; and they have no rest day and night, who give worship to the beast and his image, and have on them the mark of his name. 14:12 [hgb] 圣 徒 的 忍 耐 就 在 此 。 他 们 是 守 神 诫 命 ， 和 耶 稣 真 道 的 。 [kjv] Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus. [bbe] Here is the quiet strength of the saints, who keep the orders of God, and the faith of Jesus. 14:13 [hgb] 我 听 见 从 天 上 有 声 音 说 ， 你 要 写 下 ， 从 今 以 后 ， 在 主 里 面 而 死 的 人 有 福 了 。 圣 灵 说 ， 是 的 ， 他 们 息 了 自 己 的 劳 苦 ， 作 工 的 果 效 也 随 着 他 们 。 [kjv] And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Write, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours; and their works do follow them. [bbe] And a voice from heaven came to my ears, saying, Put in writing, There is a blessing on the dead who from now on come to their end in the Lord: yes, says the Spirit, that they may have rest from their troubles; for their works go with them. 14:14 [hgb] 我 又 观 看 ， 见 有 一 片 白 云 ， 云 上 坐 着 一 位 好 像 人 子 ， 头 上 戴 着 金 冠 冕 ， 手 里 拿 着 快 镰 刀 。 [kjv] And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud one sat like unto the Son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle. [bbe] And I saw a white cloud, and on the cloud I saw one seated, like a son of man, having on his head a crown of gold, and in his hand a sharp curved blade. 14:15 [hgb] 又 有 一 位 天 使 从 殿 中 出 来 ， 向 那 坐 在 云 上 的 大 声 喊 着 说 ， 伸 出 你 的 镰 刀 来 收 割 。 因 为 收 割 的 时 候 已 经 到 了 ， 地 上 的 庄 稼 已 经 熟 透 了 。 [kjv] And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud, Thrust in thy sickle, and reap: for the time is come for thee to reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe. [bbe] And another angel came out from the house of God, crying with a loud voice to him who was seated on the cloud, Put in your blade, and let the grain be cut: because the hour for cutting it is come; for the grain of the earth is over-ready. 14:16 [hgb] 那 坐 在 云 上 的 ， 就 把 镰 刀 扔 在 地 上 。 地 上 的 庄 稼 就 被 收 割 了 。 [kjv] And he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the earth; and the earth was reaped. [bbe] And he who was seated on the cloud sent in his blade on the earth; and the grain of the earth was cut. 14:17 [hgb] 又 有 一 位 天 使 从 天 上 的 殿 中 出 来 ， 他 也 拿 着 快 镰 刀 。 [kjv] And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle. [bbe] And another angel came out from the house of God which is in heaven, having a sharp curved blade. 14:18 [hgb] 又 有 一 位 天 使 从 祭 坛 中 出 来 ， 是 有 权 柄 管 火 的 ， 向 拿 着 快 镰 刀 的 大 声 喊 着 说 ， 伸 出 快 镰 刀 来 收 取 地 上 葡 萄 树 的 果 子 。 因 为 葡 萄 熟 透 了 。 [kjv] And another angel came out from the altar, which had power over fire; and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp sickle, saying, Thrust in thy sharp sickle, and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe. [bbe] And another angel came out from the altar, who has power over fire; and he gave a loud cry to him who had the sharp curved blade, saying, Put in your sharp blade, and let the grapes of the vine of the earth be cut; for her grapes are fully ready. 14:19 [hgb] 那 天 使 就 把 镰 刀 扔 在 地 上 ， 收 取 了 地 上 的 葡 萄 ， 丢 在 神 忿 怒 的 大 酒 榨 中 。 [kjv] And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth, and cast it into the great winepress of the wrath of God. [bbe] And the angel sent his blade into the earth, and the vine of the earth was cut, and he put it into the great wine-crusher of the wrath of God. 14:20 [hgb] 那 酒 榨 踹 在 城 外 ， 就 有 血 从 酒 榨 里 流 出 来 ， 高 到 马 的 嚼 环 ， 远 有 六 百 里 。 [kjv] And the winepress was trodden without the city, and blood came out of the winepress, even unto the horse bridles, by the space of a thousand and six hundred furlongs. [bbe] And the grapes were crushed under foot outside the town, and blood came out from them, even to the head-bands of the horses, two hundred miles.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/171/2301.html","bookId":91,"book":{"id":91,"title":"启示录 Revelation","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 耶 稣 基 督 的 启 示 ， 就 是 神 赐 给 他 ， 叫 他 将 必 要 快 成 的 事 指 示 他 的 众 仆 人 。 他 就 差 遣 使 者 ， 晓 谕 他 的 仆 人 约 翰 。 [kjv] The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew unto his ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/171","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:15 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:30 AM"}}
