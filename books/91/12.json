[bbe] And she was with child; and she gave a cry, in the pains of childbirth. 12:3 [hgb] 天 上 又 现 出 异 象 来 。 有 一 条 大 红 龙 ， 七 头 十 角 ， 七 头 上 戴 着 七 个 冠 冕 。 [kjv] And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads. [bbe] And there was seen another sign in heaven; a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his heads seven crowns. 12:4 [hgb] 它 的 尾 巴 拖 拉 着 天 上 星 辰 的 三 分 之 一 ， 摔 在 地 上 。 龙 就 站 在 那 将 要 生 产 的 妇 人 面 前 ， 等 她 生 产 之 后 ， 要 吞 吃 她 的 孩 子 。 [kjv] And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born. [bbe] And his tail was pulling a third part of the stars of heaven down to the earth, and the dragon took his place before the woman who was about to give birth, so that when the birth had taken place he might put an end to her child. 12:5 [hgb] 妇 人 生 了 一 个 男 孩 子 ， 是 将 来 要 用 铁 杖 辖 管 万 国 的 （ 辖 管 原 文 作 牧 ） 。 她 的 孩 子 被 提 到 神 宝 座 那 里 去 了 。 [kjv] And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and to his throne. [bbe] And she gave birth to a son, a male child, who was to have rule over all the nations with a rod of iron: and her child was taken up to God and to his high seat. 12:6 [hgb] 妇 人 就 逃 到 旷 野 ， 在 那 里 有 神 给 她 预 备 的 地 方 ， 使 她 被 养 活 一 千 二 百 六 十 天 。 [kjv] And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days. [bbe] And the woman went in flight to the waste land, where she has a place made ready by God, so that there they may give her food a thousand, two hundred and sixty days. 12:7 [hgb] 在 天 上 就 有 了 争 战 。 米 迦 勒 同 他 的 使 者 与 龙 争 战 。 龙 也 同 它 的 使 者 去 争 战 。 [kjv] And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels, [bbe] And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels going out to the fight with the dragon; and the dragon and his angels made war, 12:8 [hgb] 并 没 有 得 胜 ， 天 上 再 没 有 它 们 的 地 方 。 [kjv] And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven. [bbe] And they were overcome, and there was no more place for them in heaven. 12:9 [hgb] 大 龙 就 是 那 古 蛇 ， 名 叫 魔 鬼 ， 又 叫 撒 但 ， 是 迷 惑 普 天 下 的 。 它 被 摔 在 地 上 ， 它 的 使 者 也 一 同 被 摔 下 去 。 [kjv] And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him. [bbe] And the great dragon was forced down, the old snake, who is named the Evil One and Satan, by whom all the earth is turned from the right way; he was forced down to the earth, and his angels were forced down with him. 12:10 [hgb] 我 听 见 在 天 上 有 大 声 音 说 ， 我 神 的 救 恩 ， 能 力 ， 国 度 ， 并 他 基 督 的 权 柄 ， 现 在 都 来 到 了 。 因 为 那 在 我 们 神 面 前 昼 夜 控 告 我 们 弟 兄 的 ， 已 经 被 摔 下 去 了 。 [kjv] And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night. [bbe] And a great voice in heaven came to my ears, saying, Now is come the salvation, and the power, and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Christ: because he who says evil against our brothers before our God day and night is forced down. 12:11 [hgb] 弟 兄 胜 过 它 ， 是 因 羔 羊 的 血 ， 和 自 己 所 见 证 的 道 。 他 们 虽 至 于 死 ， 也 不 爱 惜 性 命 。 [kjv] And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death. [bbe] And they overcame him through the blood of the Lamb and the word of their witness; and loving not their lives they freely gave themselves up to death. 12:12 [hgb] 所 以 诸 天 和 住 在 其 中 的 ， 你 们 都 快 乐 吧 。 只 是 地 与 海 有 祸 了 ， 因 为 魔 鬼 知 道 自 己 的 时 候 不 多 ， 就 气 忿 忿 地 下 到 你 们 那 里 去 了 。 [kjv] Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time. [bbe] Be glad then, O heavens, and you who are in them. But there is trouble for the earth and the sea: because the Evil One has come down to you, being very angry, having the knowledge that he has but a short time. 12:13 [hgb] 龙 见 自 己 被 摔 在 地 上 ， 就 逼 迫 那 生 男 孩 子 的 妇 人 。 [kjv] And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child. [bbe] And when the dragon saw that he was forced down to the earth, he made cruel attacks on the woman who gave birth to the male child. 12:14 [hgb] 于 是 有 大 鹰 的 两 个 翅 膀 赐 给 妇 人 ， 叫 她 能 飞 到 旷 野 ， 到 自 己 的 地 方 ， 躲 避 那 蛇 。 她 在 那 里 被 养 活 一 载 二 载 半 载 。 [kjv] And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent. [bbe] And there were given to the woman two wings of a great eagle, so that she might go in flight into the waste land, to her place, where she is given food for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the snake. 12:15 [hgb] 蛇 就 在 妇 人 身 后 ， 从 口 中 吐 出 水 来 像 河 一 样 ， 要 将 妇 人 冲 去 。 [kjv] And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood. [bbe] And the snake sent out of his mouth after the woman a river of water, so that she might be taken away by the stream. 12:16 [hgb] 地 却 帮 助 妇 人 ， 开 口 吞 了 从 龙 口 吐 出 来 的 水 。 （ 原 文 作 河 ） [kjv] And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth. [bbe] And the earth gave help to the woman, and with open mouth took up the river which the dragon sent out of his mouth. 12:17 [hgb] 龙 向 妇 人 发 怒 ， 去 与 她 其 余 的 儿 女 争 战 ， 这 儿 女 就 是 那 守 神 诫 命 ， 为 耶 稣 作 见 证 的 。 那 时 龙 就 站 在 海 边 的 沙 上 。 [kjv] And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ. [bbe] And the dragon was angry with the woman and went away to make war on the rest of her seed, who keep the orders of God, and the witness of Jesus:","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/171/2299.html","bookId":91,"book":{"id":91,"title":"启示录 Revelation","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 耶 稣 基 督 的 启 示 ， 就 是 神 赐 给 他 ， 叫 他 将 必 要 快 成 的 事 指 示 他 的 众 仆 人 。 他 就 差 遣 使 者 ， 晓 谕 他 的 仆 人 约 翰 。 [kjv] The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew unto his ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/171","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:15 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:30 AM"}}
