[bbe] Who gave witness of the word of God, and of the witness of Jesus Christ, even of all the things which he saw. 1:3 [hgb] 念 这 书 上 预 言 的 ， 和 那 些 听 见 又 遵 守 其 中 所 记 载 的 ， 都 是 有 福 的 。 因 为 日 期 近 了 。 [kjv] Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the time is at hand. [bbe] A blessing be on the reader, and on those who give ear to the prophet\u0027s words, and keep the things which he has put in the book: for the time is near. 1:4 [hgb] 约 翰 写 信 给 亚 西 亚 的 七 个 教 会 。 但 愿 从 那 昔 在 今 在 以 后 永 在 的 神 和 他 宝 座 前 的 七 灵 。 [kjv] John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace be unto you, and peace, from him which is, and which was, and which is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne; [bbe] John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace to you and peace, from him who is and was and is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his high seat; 1:5 [hgb] 并 那 诚 实 作 见 证 的 ， 从 死 里 首 先 复 活 ， 为 世 上 君 王 元 首 的 耶 稣 基 督 。 有 恩 惠 平 安 归 与 你 们 。 他 爱 我 们 ， 用 自 己 的 血 使 我 们 脱 离 罪 恶 。 （ 脱 离 有 古 卷 作 洗 去 ） [kjv] And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth. Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in his own blood, [bbe] And from Jesus Christ, the true witness, the first to come back from the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. To him who had love for us and has made us clean from our sins by his blood; 1:6 [hgb] 又 使 我 们 成 为 国 民 ， 作 他 父 神 的 祭 司 。 但 愿 荣 耀 权 能 归 给 他 ， 直 到 永 永 远 远 。 阿 们 。 [kjv] And hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen. [bbe] And has made us to be a kingdom and priests to his God and Father; to him let glory and power be given for ever and ever. So be it. 1:7 [hgb] 看 哪 ， 他 驾 云 降 临 。 众 目 要 看 见 他 ， 连 刺 他 的 人 也 要 看 见 他 。 地 上 的 万 族 都 要 因 他 哀 哭 。 这 话 是 真 实 的 。 阿 们 。 [kjv] Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen. [bbe] See, he comes with the clouds, and every eye will see him, and those by whom he was wounded; and all the tribes of the earth will be sorrowing because of him. Yes, so be it. 1:8 [hgb] 主 神 说 ， 我 是 阿 拉 法 ， 我 是 俄 梅 戛 （ 阿 拉 法 俄 梅 戛 乃 希 腊 字 母 首 末 二 字 ） ， 是 昔 在 今 在 以 后 永 在 的 全 能 者 。 [kjv] I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty. [bbe] I am the First and the Last, says the Lord God who is and was and is to come, the Ruler of all. 1:9 [hgb] 我 约 翰 就 是 你 们 的 弟 兄 ， 和 你 们 在 耶 稣 的 患 难 ， 国 度 ， 忍 耐 里 一 同 有 分 。 为 神 的 道 ， 并 为 给 耶 稣 作 的 见 证 ， 曾 在 那 名 叫 拔 摩 的 海 岛 上 。 [kjv] I John, who also am your brother, and companion in tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ, was in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God, and for the testimony of Jesus Christ. [bbe] I, John, your brother, who have a part with you in the trouble and the kingdom and the quiet strength of Jesus, was in the island which is named Patmos, for the word of God and the witness of Jesus. 1:10 [hgb] 当 主 日 我 被 圣 灵 感 动 ， 听 见 在 我 后 面 有 大 声 音 如 吹 号 说 ， [kjv] I was in the Spirit on the Lord\u0027s day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet, [bbe] I was in the Spirit on the Lord\u0027s day, and a great voice at my back, as of a horn, came to my ears, 1:11 [hgb] 你 所 看 见 的 ， 当 写 在 书 上 ， 达 与 以 弗 所 ， 士 每 拿 ， 别 迦 摩 ， 推 雅 推 喇 ， 撒 狄 ， 非 拉 铁 非 ， 老 底 嘉 ， 那 七 个 教 会 。 [kjv] Saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last: and, What thou seest, write in a book, and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia; unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and unto Pergamos, and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea. [bbe] Saying, What you see, put in a book, and send it to the seven churches; to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamos and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea. 1:12 [hgb] 我 转 过 身 来 ， 要 看 是 谁 发 声 与 我 说 话 。 既 转 过 来 ， 就 看 见 七 个 金 灯 台 。 [kjv] And I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks; [bbe] And turning to see the voice which said these words to me, I saw seven gold vessels with lights burning in them; 1:13 [hgb] 灯 台 中 间 ， 有 一 位 好 像 人 子 ， 身 穿 长 衣 ， 直 垂 到 脚 ， 胸 间 束 着 金 带 。 [kjv] And in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the paps with a golden girdle. [bbe] And in the middle of them one like a son of man, clothed with a robe down to his feet, and with a band of gold round his breasts. 1:14 [hgb] 他 的 头 与 发 皆 白 ， 如 白 羊 毛 ， 如 雪 。 眼 目 如 同 火 焰 。 [kjv] His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire; [bbe] And his head and his hair were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire; 1:15 [hgb] 脚 好 像 在 炉 中 锻 炼 光 明 的 铜 。 声 音 如 同 众 水 的 声 音 。 [kjv] And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters. [bbe] And his feet like polished brass, as if it had been burned in a fire; and his voice was as the sound of great waters. 1:16 [hgb] 他 右 手 拿 着 七 星 。 从 他 口 中 出 来 一 把 两 刃 的 利 剑 。 面 貌 如 同 烈 日 放 光 。 [kjv] And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp twoedged sword: and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength. [bbe] And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth came a sharp two-edged sword: and his face was like the sun shining in its strength. 1:17 [hgb] 我 一 看 见 ， 就 仆 倒 在 他 脚 前 ， 像 死 了 一 样 。 他 用 右 手 按 着 我 说 ， 不 要 惧 怕 。 我 是 首 先 的 ， 我 是 末 后 的 ， [kjv] And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the last: [bbe] And when I saw him, I went down on my face at his feet as one dead. And he put his right hand on me, saying, Have no fear; I am the first and the last and the Living one; 1:18 [hgb] 又 是 那 存 活 的 。 我 曾 死 过 ， 现 在 又 活 了 ， 直 活 到 永 永 远 远 。 并 且 拿 着 死 亡 和 阴 间 的 钥 匙 。 [kjv] I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death. [bbe] And I was dead, and see, I am living for ever, and I have the keys of death and of Hell. 1:19 [hgb] 所 以 你 要 把 所 看 见 的 ， 和 现 在 的 事 ， 并 将 来 必 成 的 事 ， 都 写 出 来 。 [kjv] Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter; [bbe] Put in writing, then, the things which you have seen, and the things which are, and the things which will be after these; 1:20 [hgb] 论 到 你 所 看 见 在 我 右 手 中 的 七 星 ， 和 七 个 金 灯 台 的 奥 秘 。 那 七 星 就 是 七 个 教 会 的 使 者 。 七 灯 台 就 是 七 个 教 会 。 [kjv] The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks which thou sawest are the seven churches. [bbe] The secret of the seven stars which you saw in my right hand, and of the seven gold vessels with burning lights. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven lights are the seven churches.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/171/2288.html","bookId":91,"book":{"id":91,"title":"启示录 Revelation","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 耶 稣 基 督 的 启 示 ， 就 是 神 赐 给 他 ， 叫 他 将 必 要 快 成 的 事 指 示 他 的 众 仆 人 。 他 就 差 遣 使 者 ， 晓 谕 他 的 仆 人 约 翰 。 [kjv] The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew unto his ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/171","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:15 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:30 AM"}}
