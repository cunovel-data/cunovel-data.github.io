{"id":2408,"no":20,"title":"Chapter 20","content":"20:1 [hgb] 我 又 看 见 一 位 天 使 从 天 降 下 ， 手 里 拿 着 无 底 坑 的 钥 匙 ， 和 一 条 大 链 子 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand. \\n\\n [bbe] And I saw an angel coming down out of heaven, having the key of the great deep and a great chain in his hand. \\n\\n 20:2 [hgb] 他 捉 住 那 龙 ， 就 是 古 蛇 ， 又 叫 魔 鬼 ， 也 叫 撒 但 ， 把 它 捆 绑 一 千 年 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years, \\n\\n [bbe] And he took the dragon, the old snake, which is the Evil One and Satan, and put chains on him for a thousand years, \\n\\n 20:3 [hgb] 扔 在 无 底 坑 里 ， 将 无 底 坑 关 闭 ， 用 印 封 上 ， 使 它 不 得 再 迷 惑 列 国 ， 等 到 那 一 千 年 完 了 。 以 后 必 须 暂 时 释 放 它 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more, till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he must be loosed a little season. \\n\\n [bbe] And put him into the great deep, and it was shut and locked over him, so that he might put the nations in error no longer, till the thousand years were ended: after this he will be let loose for a little time. \\n\\n 20:4 [hgb] 我 又 看 见 几 个 宝 座 ， 也 有 坐 在 上 面 的 ， 并 有 审 判 的 权 柄 赐 给 他 们 。 我 又 看 见 那 些 因 为 给 耶 稣 作 见 证 ， 并 为 神 之 道 被 斩 者 的 灵 魂 ， 和 那 没 有 拜 过 兽 与 兽 像 ， 也 没 有 在 额 上 和 手 上 受 过 它 印 记 之 人 的 灵 魂 ， 他 们 都 复 活 了 ， 与 基 督 一 同 作 王 一 千 年 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years. \\n\\n [bbe] And I saw high seats, and they were seated on them, and the right of judging was given to them: and I saw the souls of those who were put to death for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God, and those who did not give worship to the beast, or to his image, and had not his mark on their brows or on their hands; and they were living and ruling with Christ a thousand years. \\n\\n 20:5 [hgb] 这 是 头 一 次 的 复 活 。 其 余 的 死 人 还 没 有 复 活 ， 直 等 那 一 千 年 完 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection. \\n\\n [bbe] The rest of the dead did not come to life again till the thousand years were ended. This is the first coming back from the dead. \\n\\n 20:6 [hgb] 在 头 一 次 复 活 有 分 的 ， 有 福 了 ， 圣 洁 了 。 第 二 次 的 死 在 他 们 身 上 没 有 权 柄 。 他 们 必 作 神 和 基 督 的 祭 司 ， 并 要 与 基 督 一 同 作 王 一 千 年 。 \\n\\n [kjv] Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years. \\n\\n [bbe] Happy and holy is he who has a part in this first coming: over these the second death has no authority, but they will be priests of God and of Christ, and will be ruling with him a thousand years. \\n\\n 20:7 [hgb] 那 一 千 年 完 了 ， 撒 但 必 从 监 牢 里 被 释 放 ， \\n\\n [kjv] And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison, \\n\\n [bbe] And when the thousand years are ended, Satan will be let loose out of his prison, \\n\\n 20:8 [hgb] 出 来 要 迷 惑 地 上 四 方 的 列 国 ， （ 方 原 文 作 角 ） 就 是 歌 革 和 玛 各 ， 叫 他 们 聚 集 争 战 。 他 们 的 人 数 多 如 海 沙 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea. \\n\\n [bbe] And will go out to put in error the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to get them together to the war, the number of whom is like the sands of the sea. \\n\\n 20:9 [hgb] 他 们 上 来 遍 满 了 全 地 ， 围 住 圣 徒 的 营 ， 与 蒙 爱 的 城 。 就 有 火 从 天 降 下 ， 烧 灭 了 他 们 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them. \\n\\n [bbe] And they went up over the face of the earth, and made a circle about the tents of the saints, and the well loved town: and fire came down out of heaven for their destruction. \\n\\n 20:10 [hgb] 那 迷 惑 他 们 的 魔 鬼 ， 被 扔 在 硫 磺 的 火 湖 里 ， 就 是 兽 和 假 先 知 所 在 的 地 方 。 他 们 必 昼 夜 受 痛 苦 ， 直 到 永 永 远 远 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever. \\n\\n [bbe] And the Evil One who put them in error was sent down into the sea of ever-burning fire, where the beast and the false prophet are, and their punishment will go on day and night for ever and ever. \\n\\n 20:11 [hgb] 我 又 看 见 一 个 白 色 的 大 宝 座 ， 与 坐 在 上 面 的 。 从 他 面 前 天 地 都 逃 避 ， 再 无 可 见 之 处 了 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them. \\n\\n [bbe] And I saw a great white seat, and him who was seated on it, before whose face the earth and the heaven went in flight; and there was no place for them. \\n\\n 20:12 [hgb] 我 又 看 见 死 了 的 人 ， 无 论 大 小 ， 都 站 在 宝 座 前 。 案 卷 展 开 了 。 并 且 另 有 一 卷 展 开 ， 就 是 生 命 册 。 死 了 的 人 都 凭 着 这 些 案 卷 所 记 载 的 ， 照 他 们 所 行 的 受 审 判 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works. \\n\\n [bbe] And I saw the dead, great and small, taking their places before the high seat; and the books were open, and another book was open, which is the book of life; and the dead were judged by the things which were in the books, even by their works. \\n\\n 20:13 [hgb] 于 是 海 交 出 其 中 的 死 人 。 死 亡 和 阴 间 也 交 出 其 中 的 死 人 。 他 们 都 照 各 人 所 行 的 受 审 判 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were judged every man according to their works. \\n\\n [bbe] And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and Hell gave up the dead which were in them; and they were judged every man by his works. \\n\\n 20:14 [hgb] 死 亡 和 阴 间 也 被 扔 在 火 湖 里 。 这 火 湖 就 是 第 二 次 的 死 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. \\n\\n [bbe] And death and Hell were put into the sea of fire. This is the second death, even the sea of fire. \\n\\n 20:15 [hgb] 若 有 人 名 字 没 记 在 生 命 册 上 ， 他 就 被 扔 在 火 湖 里 。 \\n\\n [kjv] And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire. \\n\\n [bbe] And if anyone\u0027s name was not in the book of life, he went down into the sea of fire. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/171/2307.html","bookId":91,"book":{"id":91,"title":"启示录 Revelation","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 耶 稣 基 督 的 启 示 ， 就 是 神 赐 给 他 ， 叫 他 将 必 要 快 成 的 事 指 示 他 的 众 仆 人 。 他 就 差 遣 使 者 ， 晓 谕 他 的 仆 人 约 翰 。 [kjv] The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew unto his ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/171","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:15 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:30 AM"}}
