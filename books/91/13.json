{"id":2401,"no":13,"title":"Chapter 13","content":"13:1 [hgb] 我 又 看 见 一 个 兽 从 海 中 上 来 ， 有 十 角 七 头 ， 在 十 角 上 戴 着 十 个 冠 冕 ， 七 头 上 有 亵 渎 的 名 号 。 \n [kjv] And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy. \n [bbe] And he took his place on the sand of the sea. And I saw a beast coming up out of the sea, having ten horns and seven heads, and on his horns ten crowns, and on his heads unholy names. \n 13:2 [hgb] 我 所 看 见 的 兽 ， 形 状 像 豹 ， 脚 像 熊 的 脚 ， 口 像 狮 子 的 口 。 那 龙 将 自 己 的 能 力 ， 座 位 ， 和 大 权 柄 ， 都 给 了 它 。 \n [kjv] And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority. \n [bbe] And the beast which I saw was like a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power and his seat and great authority. \n 13:3 [hgb] 我 看 见 兽 的 七 头 中 ， 有 一 个 似 乎 受 了 死 伤 。 那 死 伤 却 医 好 了 。 全 地 的 人 ， 都 希 奇 跟 从 那 兽 。 \n [kjv] And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast. \n [bbe] And I saw one of his heads as if it had been given a death-wound; and his death-wound was made well: and all the earth was wondering at the beast. \n 13:4 [hgb] 又 拜 那 龙 ， 因 为 它 将 自 己 的 权 柄 给 了 兽 。 也 拜 兽 说 ， 谁 能 比 这 兽 ， 谁 能 与 它 交 战 呢 ？ \n [kjv] And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like unto the beast? who is able to make war with him? \n [bbe] And they gave worship to the dragon, because he gave authority to the beast; and worshipping the beast, they said, Who is like the beast? and who is able to go to war with him? \n 13:5 [hgb] 又 赐 给 它 说 夸 大 亵 渎 话 的 口 。 又 有 权 柄 赐 给 它 ， 可 以 任 意 而 行 四 十 二 个 月 。 \n [kjv] And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months. \n [bbe] And there was given to him a mouth to say words of pride against God; and there was given to him authority to go on for forty-two months. \n 13:6 [hgb] 兽 就 开 口 向 神 说 亵 渎 的 话 ， 亵 渎 神 的 名 ， 并 他 的 帐 幕 ， 以 及 那 些 住 在 天 上 的 。 \n [kjv] And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven. \n [bbe] And his mouth was open to say evil against God, and against his name and his Tent, even against those who are in heaven. \n 13:7 [hgb] 又 任 凭 它 与 圣 徒 争 战 ， 并 且 得 胜 。 也 把 权 柄 赐 给 它 ， 制 伏 各 族 各 民 各 方 各 国 。 \n [kjv] And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and tongues, and nations. \n [bbe] And it was given to him to make war on the saints and to overcome them: and there was given to him authority over every tribe and people and language and nation. \n 13:8 [hgb] 凡 住 在 地 上 ， 名 字 从 创 世 以 来 ， 没 有 记 在 被 杀 之 羔 羊 生 命 册 上 的 人 ， 都 要 拜 它 。 \n [kjv] And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world. \n [bbe] And all who are on the earth will give him worship, everyone whose name has not been from the first in the book of life of the Lamb who was put to death. \n 13:9 [hgb] 凡 有 耳 的 ， 就 应 当 听 。 \n [kjv] If any man have an ear, let him hear. \n [bbe] If any man has ears, let him give ear. \n 13:10 [hgb] 掳 掠 人 的 必 被 掳 掠 。 用 刀 杀 人 的 ， 必 被 刀 杀 。 圣 徒 的 忍 耐 和 信 心 ， 就 是 在 此 。 \n [kjv] He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints. \n [bbe] If any man sends others into prison, into prison he will go: if any man puts to death with the sword, with the sword will he be put to death. Here is the quiet strength and the faith of the saints. \n 13:11 [hgb] 我 又 看 见 另 有 一 个 兽 从 地 中 上 来 。 有 两 角 如 同 羊 羔 ， 说 话 好 像 龙 。 \n [kjv] And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon. \n [bbe] And I saw another beast coming up out of the earth; and he had two horns like a lamb, and his voice was like that of a dragon. \n 13:12 [hgb] 它 在 头 一 个 兽 面 前 ， 施 行 头 一 个 兽 所 有 的 权 柄 。 并 且 叫 地 和 住 在 地 上 的 人 ， 拜 那 死 伤 医 好 的 头 一 个 兽 。 \n [kjv] And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him, and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed. \n [bbe] And he makes use of all the authority of the first beast before his eyes. And he makes the earth and those who are in it give worship to the first beast, whose death-wound was made well. \n 13:13 [hgb] 又 行 大 奇 事 ， 甚 至 在 人 面 前 ， 叫 火 从 天 降 在 地 上 。 \n [kjv] And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men, \n [bbe] And he does great signs, even making fire come down from heaven on the earth before the eyes of men. \n 13:14 [hgb] 它 因 赐 给 它 权 柄 在 兽 面 前 能 行 奇 事 ， 就 迷 惑 住 在 地 上 的 人 ， 说 ， 要 给 那 受 刀 伤 还 活 着 的 兽 作 个 像 。 \n [kjv] And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a sword, and did live. \n [bbe] And those who are on the earth are turned from the true way by him through the signs which he was given power to do before the beast; giving orders to those who are on the earth to make an image to the beast, who was wounded by the sword, and came to life. \n 13:15 [hgb] 又 有 权 柄 赐 给 它 叫 兽 像 有 生 气 。 并 且 能 说 话 ， 又 叫 所 有 不 拜 兽 像 的 人 都 被 杀 害 。 \n [kjv] And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed. \n [bbe] And he had power to give breath to the image of the beast, so that words might come from the image of the beast, and that he might have all those who did not give worship to the image of the beast put to death. \n 13:16 [hgb] 它 又 叫 众 人 ， 无 论 大 小 贫 富 ， 自 主 的 ， 为 奴 的 ， 都 在 右 手 上 ， 或 是 在 额 上 ， 受 一 个 印 记 。 \n [kjv] And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads: \n [bbe] And he gives to all, small and great, the poor and those who have wealth, the free and those who are not free, a mark on their right hand or on their brows; \n 13:17 [hgb] 除 了 那 受 印 记 ， 有 了 兽 名 ， 或 有 兽 名 数 目 的 ， 都 不 得 作 买 卖 。 \n [kjv] And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the beast, or the number of his name. \n [bbe] So that no man might be able to do trade but he who has the mark, even the name of the beast or the number of his name. \n 13:18 [hgb] 在 这 里 有 智 慧 。 凡 有 聪 明 的 ， 可 以 算 计 兽 的 数 目 ， 因 为 这 是 人 的 数 目 。 它 的 数 目 是 六 百 六 十 六 。 \n [kjv] Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six. \n [bbe] Here is wisdom. He who has knowledge let him get the number of the beast; because it is the number of a man: and his number is Six hundred and sixty-six. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/171/2300.html","bookId":91,"book":{"id":91,"title":"启示录 Revelation","description":"简介： 1:1 [hgb] 耶 稣 基 督 的 启 示 ， 就 是 神 赐 给 他 ， 叫 他 将 必 要 快 成 的 事 指 示 他 的 众 仆 人 。 他 就 差 遣 使 者 ， 晓 谕 他 的 仆 人 约 翰 。 [kjv] The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to shew unto his ...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"双语小说","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/shuangyu/171","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:15 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:23:30 AM"}}
