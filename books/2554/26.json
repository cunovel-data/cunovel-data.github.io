He found an X-Acto number two knife with a long slim aluminum handle and a sharp-pointed number eleven blade.\n Perfect for cutting off eyelids.\n At least Hank thought it would be perfect. He shuddered at the thought of it happening to him. Something like that would never even have occurred to him. But Szeto seemed pretty comfortable with it. Like maybe this wouldn\u0027t be his first eyelidectomy.\n Be the first for Hank. He was kind of looking forward to it. He\u0027d never tortured anyone. Before becoming King of the Kickers, he\u0027d earned his daily bread alternating between a knocker and a sticker in a slaughterhouse. The former involved shooting a steel bolt into cows\u0027 heads to knock them out; the latter meant slitting the cow\u0027s throat as it hung by a back leg from an overhead rail. So blood and guts were no problem.\n Especially this guy\u0027s blood and guts. The son of a bitch had stolen his Compendium of Srem. But worse than that, he\u0027d made a fool of Hank while doing it, right out in public on the streets of New York. Nothing too bad could happen to this guy.\n But the thing was, Hank didn\u0027t want the guy to die before he told him where he\u0027d stashed the Compendium. Or if he\u0027d sold it, who to.\n He found a pair of needle-nose pliers. Might be good for yanking off fingernails. He added that to his shopping basket and moved on till he came across some Drano Kitchen Crystals. Sprinkle some of that onto lidless eyes ... oh, yeah.\n He kept shopping ... \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dark-at-the-end/page-26.html","bookId":2554,"book":{"id":2554,"title":"The Dark at the End","description":"Storyline: \n The Dark at the End (Repairman Jack #15) \n Bound by his promise to Glaeken, Jack has refrained from making any direct moves against Rasalom. But things have changed so there\u0027s nothing holding Jack in check any longer. Other changes are occurring as well. Jack is healing at an accelerated rate--much like Glaeken did when he was immortal. This can only mean that Glaeken\u0027s time is almost up and when he dies, Jack takes his place. \n Rasalom continues to plot against the Lady. Twice she has died and returned; a third time and she will be gone, leaving a clear path for the Otherness to infiltrate this reality. But Ernst Drexler, formerly Rasalom\u0027s go-to guy for logistical support, fears he will be left out in the cold when the Change comes. He forms an uneasy alliance with Jack, who is preparing to face their old enemy. \n Meanwhile, Dawn Pickering is searching for her supposedly dead baby. The trail leads her to a mansion in a remote Long Island coastal town, where she discovers a truth she could have never imagined. \n Now the stage is set for Jack\u0027s massive assault on Rasalom. Jack knows he\u0027s got just one shot. But it\u0027s not just a matter of taking out Rasalom: he also must safely retrieve Dawn\u0027s child and minimize collateral damage. So, he comes up with a foolproof plan. \n But fools are always with usâ€¦.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-dark-at-the-end.jpg","author":"F.
