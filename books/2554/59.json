He spotted him by the big picture window, silhouetted against the glow of the snowy city.\\n\\n Three and a half hours on the road to get here, dreading and anticipating this moment.\\n\\n \"Well?\"\\n\\n Glaeken didn\u0027t turn from the window.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re asking me if he lives?\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t know?\"\\n\\n \"I blew him up, set him on fire, and blew him up again. But I couldn\u0027t confirm the kill. What\u0027s left of him is somewhere on or under Gardiner\u0027s Bay.\"\\n\\n Glaeken sighed. \"He lives.\"\\n\\n Jack dropped onto the couch and let his head drop back. \"Shit.\"\\n\\n \"But barely. Just barely.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s that mean?\"\\n\\n Now Glaeken turned but Jack could not see his features. He imagined a pretty grim expression.\\n\\n \"Ever since his rebirth he has been a presence, a dissonant hum between my ears. That hum is still there, yet it has grown so faint in the past few hours that it hovers on the edge of perception. He is severely wounded, perhaps mortally so. He is dying.\"\\n\\n \"But he\u0027s not dead.\"\\n\\n The silhouette shook its head. \"No. Not yet.\"\\n\\n Jack didn\u0027t know what more he could do. Be great if he knew someone in the Coast Guard. He could commandeer a cutter and go out in the storm with a harpoon, searching for what was left of Rasalom.\\n\\n Yeah, right.\\n\\n \"Tell me the circumstances.\"\\n\\n Jack recounted the progression of events during the four fateful minutes in Nuckateague.\\n\\n Glaeken shook his head. \"I don\u0027t see what else you could have done.\"\\n\\n \"I could have gotten more up close and more personal.\"\\n\\n \"And if you had, you might not be here describing your travails.\"\\n\\n Jack banged the arm of the couch with a fist. \"I don\u0027t know what else to do.\"\\n\\n \"We wait. From the sound of what you put him through, he must die soon. Unless...\"\\n\\n The last thing Jack wanted to hear right then was an unless.\\n\\n \"Unless what?\"\\n\\n \"Unless someone helps him. But his two attendants are dead, and the storm is keeping everyone inside. Where could he find help?\"\\n\\n \"He could wash up near the house and some rescue worker could spot him and pull him out. Some CPR, some IV fluids, some hypothermia treatment, and some do-gooder could assure the end of life as we know it.\"\\n\\n \"What are the chances?\"\\n\\n \"Who knows? I listened to the radio all the way in. Plenty of talk about the fire and the three bodies, but not a word about a survivor.\"\\n\\n \"Yet.\"\\n\\n Jack nodded. \"Let\u0027s turn on the TV and keep posted as to whether there\u0027s a sole survivor of this terrible tragedy. Because if there is, he\u0027s going to require a late-night consultation by Doctor Jack to finish the job.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dark-at-the-end/page-59.html","bookId":2554,"book":{"id":2554,"title":"The Dark at the End","description":"Storyline: The Dark at the End (Repairman Jack #15) \\n Bound by his promise to Glaeken, Jack has refrained from making any direct moves against Rasalom. But things have changed so there\u0027s nothing holding Jack in check any longer. Other changes are occurring as well. Jack is healing at an accelerated rate--much like Glaeken did when he was immortal. This can only mean that Glaeken\u0027s time is almost up and when he dies, Jack takes his place. \\n Rasalom continues to plot against the Lady. Twice she has died and returned; a third time and she will be gone, leaving a clear path for the Otherness to infiltrate this reality. But Ernst Drexler, formerly Rasalom\u0027s go-to guy for logistical support, fears he will be left out in the cold when the Change comes. He forms an uneasy alliance with Jack, who is preparing to face their old enemy. \\n Meanwhile, Dawn Pickering is searching for her supposedly dead baby. The trail leads her to a mansion in a remote Long Island coastal town, where she discovers a truth she could have never imagined. \\n Now the stage is set for Jack\u0027s massive assault on Rasalom. Jack knows he\u0027s got just one shot. But it\u0027s not just a matter of taking out Rasalom: he also must safely retrieve Dawn\u0027s child and minimize collateral damage. So, he comes up with a foolproof plan. \\n But fools are always with usâ€¦.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-dark-at-the-end.jpg","author":"F.
