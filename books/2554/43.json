Focusing and refocusing between the Compendium on her lap and the house across the street had given her a headache.\n \"Gladly.\" She took one last glance at the mansion as she began to rise. \"Nothing doing over there any - \" The front door flew open and a man dressed in a yellow nor\u0027easter and jeans stepped out. \"Hang on a sec.\"\n He started across the yard toward the detached garage.\n \"That\u0027s Georges!\" Dawn said, pressing against Weezy\u0027s back for a better view. \"Has he got the baby with him?\"\n From the way his arms swung at his sides, Weezy knew he couldn\u0027t, but she raised the glasses anyway.\n \"Nope. Empty-handed.\"\n She bit her lip as she watched him enter the garage by the side door. Was he going somewhere simple and mundane - like the grocery store? Or had plans changed and Rasalom was coming in early? No way she could know. She was going to have to call Jack.\n But then Georges emerged carrying a pair of fishing poles.\n \"Going fishing,\" Dawn said. \"He must do that every day.\"\n \"What do you mean?\"\n \"Shortly after I got here yesterday I saw him pull the boat into the dock and get out with a bunch of flat fish.\"\n \"What did they look like?\"\n Weezy didn\u0027t really care, just something to talk about as they watched him board the boat and set the rods in holders near the stern.\n \"One side was white and the other was medium brown with dark splotches.\"\n Weezy nodded. \"Winter flounder. Good eating.\"\n \"You fish?\"\n \"No.\"\n \"Then how do you know?\"\n \"I just ... know.\"\n It\u0027s what I do.\n \"Nice cozy little life they\u0027ve got out here,\" Dawn said, her tone bitter. \"Big house, beautiful view, fresh fish daily ... and my baby.\"\n \"Not for long, Dawn. Not for long.\"\n Weezy kept the glasses trained on him as he opened the engine hatch - to release fumes, maybe? - then started the engine. He fussed with the rods while the engine warmed.\n She said, \"He must really love fishing if he\u0027s going out in this weather.\"\n The bay teemed with whitecaps, but the water here was relatively sheltered. She wondered what the surf looked like on the ocean side of the South Fork. The Atlantic had to be pretty wild right now.\n Dawn said, \"Maybe Gilda\u0027s planning a welcome-home fish fry for Mr. Osala.\"\n Weezy glanced at her, sensing fuming sulfuric acid when she said \"Gilda.\"\n They watched Georges cast off the lines and head out into the bay until the boat disappeared behind the house.\n \"Take a break,\" Dawn said. \"My turn.\"\n Weezy rose from the chair and handed her the Leica.\n \"I\u0027ll make some fresh coffee.\"\n \"No more for me, thanks. I\u0027ve had more than enough.\"\n More than enough coffee? Weezy found that an alien concept.\n \"This from the girl who likes \u0027black-hole\u0027 coffee?\"\n \"I\u0027m wound up enough as it is.\"\n Yeah, she probably was.\n \"Hang in there. This should all be over by tonight.\"\n Down in the kitchen, as Weezy filled the carafe with water for the O\u0027Donnells\u0027 Mr. Coffee, she glanced out the back door and saw flashing lights. Not good. When you\u0027d invaded someone\u0027s home, flashing lights were not good. At least they weren\u0027t blue-and-red police lights. These were orange. Still ...\n She put the carafe down and stepped to the door for a better look. Yes, flashing orange lights visible between the houses on the next street, down by the highway ...\n ... where she\u0027d parked the Jeep.\n \"Oh, Christ!\"\n She dashed back into the front room, grabbed the keys and her coat, then called upstairs.\n \"Gotta go down to the Jeep! Be right back!\"\n She didn\u0027t wait for a reply as she dashed out the back door. Only a hundred yards or so. She\u0027d make it in no time.\n She ran across the O\u0027Donnells\u0027 backyard into the scrub that buffered their property from the houses behind. She cut through a neighbor\u0027s yard - again, nobody home - and onto Bayberry Drive, the street parallel to Dune.\n No doubt about it. Those lights belonged to a tow truck. Aw, no. She\u0027d parked the SUV on a sandy path within the trees. It wasn\u0027t bothering anybody there, and it hadn\u0027t been visible from the road. How - ?\n She angled onto Nuckateague Road and raced down toward the highway. She reached it just in time to see a flatbed truck pull out with a Jeep Cherokee on its bed - her Cherokee. Or rather Jack\u0027s.\n She increased her speed, shouting and waving her arms as she chased it. Whoever was driving either didn\u0027t look back or ignored her.\n What on Earth?\n She\u0027d caught a glimpse of the writing on the driver\u0027s door. She stuttered to a stop and called up the image: Neumeister\u0027s Towing and Auto Body ... with an Amagansett address and phone number below.\n She reached into her coat pocket. She\u0027d call those sons of -\n Where was her phone? She searched through all her pockets. Damn! Back at the O\u0027Donnell place, charging.\n Puffing from the unaccustomed exertion, she turned in a small circle, stamping her feet in frustration.\n So now what? Walk back to the O\u0027Donnell place just to tell Dawn she\u0027d be delayed, and then walk back here and beyond to get to Amagansett?\n Didn\u0027t make sense. And she couldn\u0027t have Dawn drive her to town in the Volvo. That would mean leaving the mansion unwatched. Besides, Dawn\u0027s car had to stay hidden. Best to just head into Amagansett and call her from there.\n Wouldn\u0027t take long to hitch into town, pay whatever fine was due for whatever ordinance they\u0027d broken, then return.\n She began heading west along Route 27 - labeled the Montauk Highway out here. She walked backward, ready to stick out her thumb when a car approached.\n Something wet hit her face. Then another. White flakes began to swirl from above.\n Snow.\n She shook her head with chagrin. Could it get any worse? \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dark-at-the-end/page-43.html","bookId":2554,"book":{"id":2554,"title":"The Dark at the End","description":"Storyline: \n The Dark at the End (Repairman Jack #15) \n Bound by his promise to Glaeken, Jack has refrained from making any direct moves against Rasalom. But things have changed so there\u0027s nothing holding Jack in check any longer. Other changes are occurring as well. Jack is healing at an accelerated rate--much like Glaeken did when he was immortal. This can only mean that Glaeken\u0027s time is almost up and when he dies, Jack takes his place. \n Rasalom continues to plot against the Lady. Twice she has died and returned; a third time and she will be gone, leaving a clear path for the Otherness to infiltrate this reality.

He forms an uneasy alliance with Jack, who is preparing to face their old enemy. \n Meanwhile, Dawn Pickering is searching for her supposedly dead baby. The trail leads her to a mansion in a remote Long Island coastal town, where she discovers a truth she could have never imagined. \n Now the stage is set for Jack\u0027s massive assault on Rasalom.
