{"id":111889,"no":30,"title":"Page 30","content":"A sharp intake of breath hissed between Gia\u0027s teeth as she parted the hair on the right side of Jack\u0027s head. \"Oh, Jack, your scalp\u0027s all bruised.\" He knew. He\u0027d felt the squishy blood under the skin there earlier. Not the first time he\u0027d been knocked cold, but the first time in years. Doc Hargus had called it a hematoma back then - not subdural, subcutaneous. He pressed his fingers against the area now. Odd ... no squish. The last one had lasted a week. And his headache. Last time he\u0027d been knocked out his head had pounded for days. More proof that he was being changed in preparation for Glaeken\u0027s impending demise. She dabbed at the area with a cold, wet washcloth. \"You\u0027ve got a little dried blood here from these little tiny scratches.\" Which were probably bigger an hour ago. \"Oh, and look. Here\u0027s a teeny piece of glass.\" \"I can shower all that away.\" \"No, let me help.\" Normally this kind of attention would make him claustrophobic. If she were a nurse in an ER, he\u0027d be pushing her away. But injuries, even minor ones, brought out Gia\u0027s nurturing side. With every passing year Vicky needed less and less nurturing, so she had a lot stored up. Gia never made him claustrophobic. The closer the better. \"Two injuries in two days,\" she said as she picked at the glass. \"I hope you\u0027re not going to be making a habit of this.\" He smiled at her. \"If tonight ends like last night...\" \"Don\u0027t count on that. You\u0027ve got me worried now. I mean, you seem to be getting hurt lately. First your arm and now this. You never used to get hurt. Are they connected?\" \"In a way.\" \"What way?\" \"Long story. All part of a bigger problem. But this particular part of the problem has been solved.\" She stopped dabbing at his scalp. \"Solved ... do I want to know the details?\" \"Probably not.\" She sighed. \"Okay. No details. But just tell me: Is the person responsible for these injuries in a position to cause more injuries?\" \"No.\" \"Okay. Good. That\u0027s enough.\" She slipped her arms around his shoulders and hugged. \"I worry about you, you know.\" \"I know.\" Her attitude had switched a hundred and eighty degrees from last night. The arm wound had seemed old then, well on its way to healing. But this one was fresh. And he could feel her trembling inside. Still holding him, she said, \"Don\u0027t you feel it\u0027s all unraveling?\" \"\u0027All\u0027?\" \"The world.\" \"What makes you think it was ever truly raveled?\" \"You know what I mean.\" \"Yeah, unfortunately I do.\" Was she sensing Rasalom\u0027s ascent? Ever since her coma she seemed sensitized to the Conflict. She\u0027d seen what she interpreted as a landscape of the future while she was out, and it had ended in impenetrable darkness this coming spring. And spring was only weeks away. Her hug tightened. \"I\u0027m worried.\" \"I know.\" \"Not for myself, so much. I\u0027m worried for you. But most of all I\u0027m worried for Vicky. There\u0027s so much I want for her. I want her to fall in love, I want her to have a chance at motherhood, I want her to...\" \"Live long and prosper?\" She laughed softly. \"Exactly, Mister Spock. Actually, that\u0027s the least of what I want for her. I want everything for her, or at least a chance at it.\" \"I\u0027ll do my damnedest to see that she gets that chance.\" No more needed to be said.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dark-at-the-end/page-30.html","bookId":2554,"book":{"id":2554,"title":"The Dark at the End","description":"Storyline: The Dark at the End (Repairman Jack #15) Bound by his promise to Glaeken, Jack has refrained from making any direct moves against Rasalom. But things have changed so there\u0027s nothing holding Jack in check any longer. Other changes are occurring as well. Jack is healing at an accelerated rate--much like Glaeken did when he was immortal. This can only mean that Glaeken\u0027s time is almost up and when he dies, Jack takes his place. Rasalom continues to plot against the Lady. Twice she has died and returned; a third time and she will be gone, leaving a clear path for the Otherness to infiltrate this reality. But Ernst Drexler, formerly Rasalom\u0027s go-to guy for logistical support, fears he will be left out in the cold when the Change comes. He forms an uneasy alliance with Jack, who is preparing to face their old enemy. Meanwhile, Dawn Pickering is searching for her supposedly dead baby. The trail leads her to a mansion in a remote Long Island coastal town, where she discovers a truth she could have never imagined. Now the stage is set for Jack\u0027s massive assault on Rasalom. Jack knows he\u0027s got just one shot. But it\u0027s not just a matter of taking out Rasalom: he also must safely retrieve Dawn\u0027s child and minimize collateral damage. So, he comes up with a foolproof plan. But fools are always with usâ€¦.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-dark-at-the-end.jpg","author":"F.
