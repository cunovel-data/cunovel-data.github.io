{"id":111895,"no":38,"title":"Page 38","content":"The bayfront mansion occupied an oversize lot - at least triple, maybe quadruple. The excess land on either side had been left untended and filled with a tangle of wild bayberry. The leaves had dropped in the fall and the bare branches scratched and tugged at Jack as he made his way toward the west side of the house. Before approaching the mansion, he\u0027d done a quick reconnoiter of the neighborhood. Half a dozen houses occupied this end of the street. He already knew about the mansion and the O\u0027Donnell house, so he checked out the others. All four were empty. Still had to be careful, though. Never knew who was going to drive by. When he reached the yard proper, he encountered an expanse of three-quarter-inch gravel that substituted for grass out here. Good thing it was March instead of summer. No way to cross those stones in silence. If the windows were open, he\u0027d be busted. But even though they were all shut tight against the cold, he moved as carefully and silently as he could. The icy wind off the bay cut at him as he peeked through a lighted side window that looked in on the house\u0027s great room. Probably should have been called a huge room. It had a high, raftered ceiling and took up the entire waterfront side of the first floor. An unbroken line of sliding-glass doors faced the water; the stained plank walls were bedizened with all the standard beach house paraphernalia: framed seascapes, sailboat-racing pennants, mounted fish, and an assortment of nets and buoys suspended among the rafters. Two people - a heavyset gray-haired woman on the sofa and a big guy in an easy chair - watched an appropriately large flat-screen TV. And off to the side ... a white bassinet. Isn\u0027t this cozy. Just a down-homey, Norman Rockwelly domestic scene. Okay, the guy had to be Georges, and the woman fit Dawn\u0027s description of Gilda, the housekeeper. The baby himself wasn\u0027t visible and no tentacles coiled in the air above the bassinet. But after Dr. Heinze\u0027s visit today, the mere presence of the bassinet was enough. Only one thing missing: the Master of the house. Where was - ? He stiffened at the sound of a high-pitched screech from within. Not human, and not like any animal he\u0027d ever heard. Something between, that tickled the hairs on the back of his neck. He saw Georges jump in his chair - the screech had to have been much louder in there - but he didn\u0027t rise. He looked like he\u0027d heard it before. The woman, however, bounced her thick body off the couch and hurried in Jack\u0027s direction. Another screech sounded as she approached and he saw her press her hands over her ears. He ducked back as she neared. When he peeked back in, Georges was still in his chair, eyes on the screen, and Gilda was nowhere in sight. That noise ... had to be Dawn\u0027s baby. But what kind of baby had a cry like that? Jack had spent some time with Gia down in the St. Vincent\u0027s pediatric AIDS ward before the hospital shut down. He\u0027d heard a lot of distressed babies but never one that sounded like that. The sound didn\u0027t repeat. Jack watched until Gilda reappeared from a side room. He\u0027d hoped to see her carrying a baby but she was empty-handed. She returned to the sofa where she and Georges had a brief conversation before fixing their gazes on the screen again. Lowering to a crouch and stepping carefully, he moved around to the south side to what he estimated would be the window into the room she\u0027d visited. He couldn\u0027t stay here long because it faced the street where he was exposed to anyone driving past, but he felt compelled to peek. The streetlight behind him cast a skewed quadrangle of light across the floor within, ending at the legs of a crib. He saw the shadow of his head moving within the light, but the crib lay beyond it, sheathed in darkness. He spotted two bright points behind its railing - not glowing, merely reflecting the light from the window. Little eyes? But they seemed too high in the crib to belong to the baby. He\u0027d have to be standing upright for them to be at that level. Jack\u0027s knowledge about babies was on a par with his grasp of quantum mechanics, but he was pretty damn sure infants couldn\u0027t stand at only two weeks of age. But then again, this was no ordinary baby. This little guy was full of oDNA, damn near a q\u0027qr. Maybe ... No way. But damn, they looked like eyes, and they seemed trained on him ... but they didn\u0027t blink. He ducked away for fear of triggering another screech. He shook off a chill. The previous Norman Rockwelly scene had taken an Addams Family turn. He returned to the great-room window and the really important question: Where was Rasalom? What did he do in his downtime, when he wasn\u0027t plotting the end of the world? Hang upside down from a rafter? Jack couldn\u0027t help a glance up to check among the junk up there. The rest of the house was dark, so he had to assume that Rasalom was either sleeping or absent. Jack couldn\u0027t buy sleeping, so he\u0027d have to go with his being somewhere else. But where? When was he coming back? Did he ever visit? The presence of his driver was a good indication that he did. But hell, he could be a couple of continents away on some extended jaunt. If so, how long could Jack keep Dawn reined in? Dawn ... she worried him. She was the weak link here. He wished he could send her back to the city and tell her to wait while he took care of everything. But that would never fly. That infant seat in the back of her car spoke volumes: She wasn\u0027t leaving here until she had a baby in it. The question now was how much to tell her? Mention the bassinet? Would that send her flying across the street? He needed more info on Rasalom\u0027s whereabouts and knew of only one place to get it.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dark-at-the-end/page-38.html","bookId":2554,"book":{"id":2554,"title":"The Dark at the End","description":"Storyline: The Dark at the End (Repairman Jack #15) Bound by his promise to Glaeken, Jack has refrained from making any direct moves against Rasalom. But things have changed so there\u0027s nothing holding Jack in check any longer. Other changes are occurring as well. Jack is healing at an accelerated rate--much like Glaeken did when he was immortal. This can only mean that Glaeken\u0027s time is almost up and when he dies, Jack takes his place. Rasalom continues to plot against the Lady. Twice she has died and returned; a third time and she will be gone, leaving a clear path for the Otherness to infiltrate this reality. But Ernst Drexler, formerly Rasalom\u0027s go-to guy for logistical support, fears he will be left out in the cold when the Change comes. He forms an uneasy alliance with Jack, who is preparing to face their old enemy. Meanwhile, Dawn Pickering is searching for her supposedly dead baby. The trail leads her to a mansion in a remote Long Island coastal town, where she discovers a truth she could have never imagined. Now the stage is set for Jack\u0027s massive assault on Rasalom. Jack knows he\u0027s got just one shot. But it\u0027s not just a matter of taking out Rasalom: he also must safely retrieve Dawn\u0027s child and minimize collateral damage. So, he comes up with a foolproof plan. But fools are always with usâ€¦.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-dark-at-the-end.jpg","author":"F.
