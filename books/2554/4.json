{"id":111864,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"\"Well, well,\" Mack said with a smile as he admitted Jack to the foyer of Rasalom\u0027s former residence. \"If it isn\u0027t the hit man.\" Like Glaeken, \"Mr. Osala\" had occupied the top floor - in this case, floors, since the penthouse was a duplex. Jack had come looking for him, not knowing he was Rasalom, only to learn that he had moved out just a day or two before and taken everything with him. \"Hey, Mack. Osala or any of his staff been around?\" Mack shook his graying head. He had deep brown skin, a Sammy Davis Jr. build, and a Redd Foxx beard. McKinley - his first name - was engraved into the brass name tag that graced his gray uniform. \"No sign, not a word from them.\" No surprise. \"Too bad,\" Mack added. \"Yeah? Why?\" \"Because I loooove his ride. A black 1980 450SEL 6.9.\" \"An old Mercedes? I had him figured for a Maybach, or maybe a Bugatti.\" Mack shook his head. \"Uh-uh. That ain\u0027t just an \u0027old Mercedes.\u0027 Don\u0027t you dare call it that. It\u0027s one of the greatest saloons ever built.\" Jack knew Mack was baiting him with the term. He knew what he was talking about but bit anyway. \"Saloon? I thought we were talking about a car.\" Mack\u0027s eyebrows rose. \"We are, my man. That\u0027s the British term for sedan. But that SEL is a saloon.\" \"More like a tank.\" \"Got that right.\" Jack pushed the conversation back on target. \"Okay, so when Osala moved out, did you happen to notice who did the actual moving?\" Mack gave him an annoyed look. \"You take me for some kinda fool who\u0027s gonna let a bunch of yahoos come in here and clean out a tenant\u0027s apartment without knowing who they are and making sure it\u0027s cleared with the tenant ahead of time? Course I did.\" Jack knew from their previous run-in that Mack took his job very seriously. \"Was there a name on the truck?\" \"There was.\" Compared to Mack, a rock was garrulous. \"What was it?\" \"Don\u0027t remember.\" \"Crap.\" \"But I do have a work order.\" Bless you, Jack thought as he followed the bantam of a man to his cubbyhole of an office. Mack pulled open a drawer, fished around, and came up with a yellow sheet of paper. \"Here it is.\" Jack reached for it but Mack pulled it away. Jack snagged it on his second try. The name on the header came as a shock, but only for an instant, replaced by an I-should-have-known feeling and accompanied by a Bernard Herrmann cue. Mack snatched it back. \"Don\u0027t you go grabbing my papers.\" Wm. Blagden \u0026 Sons, Inc. A year and a half ago, in South Florida, a Blagden \u0026 Sons dump truck had been stolen - supposedly - and used to run down his father, leaving him in a coma. A couple of months later, Jack had followed Luther Brady to the Blagden \u0026 Sons\u0027 concrete plant in Jersey ... a bad memory there. And now the name pops up again. He had known back then the Blagden company was connected to the Order, and that the Order was connected to the Otherness and Rasalom. So not a huge surprise that when Rasalom needed his stuff moved, Blagden \u0026 Sons showed up. After all, they had trucks galore. But mostly dump trucks and cement mixers. \"What kind of truck was it?\" \"Typical box truck.\" \"Like a moving van?\" Mack glanced ceilingward. \"A moving van is a box truck.\" \"Okay, okay. Jersey plates?\" \"How\u0027d you know?\" \"Lucky guess. You don\u0027t happen to remember the plate number.\" \"Don\u0027t have to. Wrote it down. You don\u0027t think I\u0027m going to let them drive off without me knowing that, do you?\" He jotted the number on a scrap of paper and handed it to Jack. \"I suppose it would be too much to ask if they happened to have a delivery address on that work order.\" Mack nodded. \"It would.\" \"Then I guess I\u0027ll have to ask them.\" \"You really think they\u0027ll tell you?\" \"I can be very persuasive.\" He clapped Mack on his upper arm. \"Thanks for your help.\" As he turned to go, Mack said, \"Don\u0027t you want the address?\" \"Don\u0027t need it. Been there a couple of times already.\" On his second trip he\u0027d discovered the plant\u0027s awful secret.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dark-at-the-end/page-4.html","bookId":2554,"book":{"id":2554,"title":"The Dark at the End","description":"Storyline: The Dark at the End (Repairman Jack #15) Bound by his promise to Glaeken, Jack has refrained from making any direct moves against Rasalom. But things have changed so there\u0027s nothing holding Jack in check any longer. Other changes are occurring as well. Jack is healing at an accelerated rate--much like Glaeken did when he was immortal. This can only mean that Glaeken\u0027s time is almost up and when he dies, Jack takes his place. Rasalom continues to plot against the Lady. Twice she has died and returned; a third time and she will be gone, leaving a clear path for the Otherness to infiltrate this reality. But Ernst Drexler, formerly Rasalom\u0027s go-to guy for logistical support, fears he will be left out in the cold when the Change comes. He forms an uneasy alliance with Jack, who is preparing to face their old enemy. Meanwhile, Dawn Pickering is searching for her supposedly dead baby. The trail leads her to a mansion in a remote Long Island coastal town, where she discovers a truth she could have never imagined. Now the stage is set for Jack\u0027s massive assault on Rasalom. Jack knows he\u0027s got just one shot. But it\u0027s not just a matter of taking out Rasalom: he also must safely retrieve Dawn\u0027s child and minimize collateral damage. So, he comes up with a foolproof plan. But fools are always with usâ€¦.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-dark-at-the-end.jpg","author":"F.
