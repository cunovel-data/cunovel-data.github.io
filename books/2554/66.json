{"id":111922,"no":66,"title":"Page 66","content":"Ernst stormed up to the Lodge\u0027s second floor and found two Kickers replacing the door to one of the rooms. Ernst knew whose room. \"What is the meaning of this?\" \"Just following orders,\" one of the Kickers said. \"The boss told us to - \" \"Where is he?\" The other jerked a thumb over his shoulder at the room. \"Right inside.\" Ernst raised his black, silver-headed cane. \"Out of my way! Out!\" They scuttled to the sides, leaving him a clear path through the doorway. After a number of days\u0027 absence, he\u0027d returned to the Lodge and had been shocked to see its street fa\u0026ccedil;ade defaced by a pair of steel window shutters on the second floor. He stormed into the room and found Hank Thompson staring out one of those windows. \"The shutters must come down!\" Thompson smiled as he turned to face him. \"Morning, Drexler. How\u0027re they hanging?\" He was goading. Thompson seemed to take inordinate pleasure in annoying him. Well, Ernst was already annoyed - more than annoyed. \"Remove those shutters immediately.\" Thompson gave him a cold stare. \"No.\" \"This is a historic building. You cannot deface it like this.\" \"What\u0027s defaced? These are primo roll-up hurricane shutters. Heaviest of the heavy duty. Watch.\" He picked up a remote, pointed it at the nearest window, and pressed a button. With a soft clatter, a ribbed steel sheet unrolled from the cylinder at the top and slid down the tracks attached to either side of the frame. He pointed the remote at the other window and the same happened, darkening the room. He grinned. \"Pretty neat, huh? And if there\u0027s a power failure, I\u0027ve got a little gadget that lets me crank them up and down by hand.\" \"Have you gone mad? This is totally irrational. You\u0027re on the second floor. Someone would have to put up a ladder in full view of the street and the claque of your followers who drape themselves on the front steps.\" Thompson\u0027s smile faltered. \"What if what wants in isn\u0027t human? What if it flies through the air?\" Ernst stared at him. He had gone mad. \"\u0027It\u0027?\" \"The Kicker Man warned me. He hasn\u0027t led me wrong yet.\" Was he talking about the Change? Had he had some sort of premonition and was preparing for it? Ernst hoped he was wasting his time, hoped that Jack, the man Thompson hated so fiercely, had succeeded in stopping the One. \"So don\u0027t waste your breath telling me to undo this. It stays.\" Ernst turned toward the new door. \"And this?\" \"Steel. With a big bar across it. The walls are stone, two feet thick on the outside, a foot on the inside.\" He looked around, nodding. \"Yep, I\u0027ll be safe here.\" Ernst saw no point in continuing the conversation, so he walked out. Where was the One? Alive? Dead? He wished he could call Jack.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dark-at-the-end/page-66.html","bookId":2554,"book":{"id":2554,"title":"The Dark at the End","description":"Storyline: The Dark at the End (Repairman Jack #15) Bound by his promise to Glaeken, Jack has refrained from making any direct moves against Rasalom. But things have changed so there\u0027s nothing holding Jack in check any longer. Other changes are occurring as well. Jack is healing at an accelerated rate--much like Glaeken did when he was immortal. This can only mean that Glaeken\u0027s time is almost up and when he dies, Jack takes his place. Rasalom continues to plot against the Lady. Twice she has died and returned; a third time and she will be gone, leaving a clear path for the Otherness to infiltrate this reality. But Ernst Drexler, formerly Rasalom\u0027s go-to guy for logistical support, fears he will be left out in the cold when the Change comes. He forms an uneasy alliance with Jack, who is preparing to face their old enemy. Meanwhile, Dawn Pickering is searching for her supposedly dead baby. The trail leads her to a mansion in a remote Long Island coastal town, where she discovers a truth she could have never imagined. Now the stage is set for Jack\u0027s massive assault on Rasalom. Jack knows he\u0027s got just one shot. But it\u0027s not just a matter of taking out Rasalom: he also must safely retrieve Dawn\u0027s child and minimize collateral damage. So, he comes up with a foolproof plan. But fools are always with usâ€¦.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-dark-at-the-end.jpg","author":"F.
