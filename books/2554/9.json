{"id":111869,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"\"They kicked you out?\" Weezy said.\\n\\n She\u0027d run into Dawn Pickering in the lobby downstairs and they\u0027d rode the elevator up together. They now stood outside their respective apartment doors across the hall from each other. A blue-eyed blonde, Dawn had lost some baby weight in the weeks since she\u0027d delivered, but was by no means slim.\\n\\n \"Totally. Not just out of his office, out of the building.\" She glanced away. \"I sort of lost it.\"\\n\\n This wasn\u0027t good. Weezy, Jack, and Glaeken all wanted to know the baby\u0027s fate. Rasalom had personally involved himself in protecting Dawn during its gestation. He wouldn\u0027t have done that out of the goodness of his heart - he had no goodness anywhere in him, especially his heart. So the baby had to be useful to him. Or potentially so.\\n\\n And if it was useful to Rasalom, it might be useful against him.\\n\\n \"You really think stalking Doctor Heinze is the best way to find your baby?\"\\n\\n Dawn shrugged. \"If you can think of a better way, I\u0027m all ears.\"\\n\\n \"Wish I could.\"\\n\\n Weezy and Jack had tried, but besides the obstetrician - who seemed to have washed his hands of Dawn since the delivery - Heinze was their only link to the baby.\\n\\n \"So do I. But until we do, this seems the only way. But it just got harder now that I\u0027m persona non grata at the McCready building. I mean, they won\u0027t even let me through the front door anymore.\"\\n\\n Weezy had to smile.\\n\\n Dawn caught it and frowned. \"I hardly think it\u0027s funny.\"\\n\\n Touchy, touchy, Weezy thought. Dawn was becoming more and more strung out in her quest for her baby.\\n\\n \"Neither do I. It was \u0027persona non grata.\u0027 You don\u0027t hear that too often in daily conversation.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t you mean quotidian conversation?\"\\n\\n \"Um, yeah. That too.\"\\n\\n Finally Dawn allowed a faint smile. \"You know, just because I\u0027m still in my teens and say \u0027totally\u0027 a lot doesn\u0027t make me dumb. I aced my SATs, especially the verbal parts. I\u0027d be in my second semester at Colgate right now if I hadn\u0027t...\"\\n\\n Her smile crumbled as her throat worked and she blinked back sudden tears.\\n\\n Weezy\u0027s heart went out to her. This poor kid had been through more heartache in the past year than many people see in a lifetime.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s okay.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not okay. If I hadn\u0027t gotten involved with that ... that monster, I\u0027d be a college freshman instead of an unwed mother, and my own mother would still be alive.\" She shook her head. \"She used to fine me every time I said \u0027totally\u0027 and \u0027like.\u0027\"\\n\\n Weezy fought an urge to hug her. Dawn was too brittle right now. No telling how she\u0027d react.\\n\\n Aw, hell with it, she thought and slipped her arms around her.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m so sorry. I wish I could say something to make you feel better.\"\\n\\n Dawn hesitated, then, with a soft sob, returned the hug. She clung to Weezy a moment, then eased away.\\n\\n \"Just having you to talk to keeps me sane.\"\\n\\n \"You worry about staying sane?\"\\n\\n \"Not really. Well, maybe. The baby\u0027s all I can think about. Sometimes I wish I could turn it off, but it won\u0027t stop.\"\\n\\n Weezy knew how that was. She\u0027d been diagnosed as manic-depressive as a teen - they called it bipolar now. She didn\u0027t know if the diagnosis was accurate, but she\u0027d been medicated and it had helped ... some. She still hadn\u0027t been able to turn off the thoughts, but she\u0027d been able to slow them. Having a memory that wouldn\u0027t allow her to forget anything, ever, was no help either.\\n\\n Dawn wasn\u0027t bipolar, though, just post-partum and obsessed.\\n\\n \"Want to come in for some coffee?\"\\n\\n Dawn shook her head as she turned toward her apartment door. \"I know you need to go back to reading your bizarro book, and I need to crash. Haven\u0027t been sleeping much and I need to catch up if I\u0027m going to be fresh tomorrow.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s tomorrow?\"\\n\\n Dawn pushed open her door and stepped inside. \"Back to the McCready building.\"\\n\\n \"But you\u0027re, as you say, persona non grata.\"\\n\\n Her smile was grim. \"They can keep me out of the building but they can\u0027t keep me from watching it. Thanks for being a friend.\"\\n\\n She closed the door, leaving Weezy alone in the hall, wondering how long Dawn could keep going like this.\\n\\n In her own apartment, Weezy headed directly for the kitchenette and her coffeemaker. She\u0027d invested in a Keurig personal brewer - named it Katy, of course - and immediately it had become her favorite appliance. Pots of coffee went stale after a while. Her beloved Katy was always ready to brew a fresh cup for her.\\n\\n She unlocked the kitchen cabinet where she hid the Compendium of Srem, the \"bizarro book\" Dawn had mentioned. Almost as old as Glaeken and Rasalom, and virtually indestructible, Torquemada had tried to destroy it during the Spanish Inquisition but couldn\u0027t, so he buried it and built a monastery over it. It wouldn\u0027t stay buried, however, and after a torturous journey through many hands - Hank Thompson\u0027s and Jack\u0027s among them - it wound up here in Weezy\u0027s apartment.\\n\\n She laid it on the kitchen table and opened it to the leather marker she had left against the last page she\u0027d read. As usual it did not open to that page. The book had this maddening, frustrating tendency to change pages on its own. Nobody knew the exact number of pages in the Compendium - the book was designed to have a finite number of sheets but a virtually infinite number of pages. But something had gone wrong and all the pages were out of order. What you found when you turned the page rarely had anything to do with the page before. And when you turned back, the original page might have changed as well.\\n\\n She flipped to a random page, just to see what she\u0027d find. When she saw the header, she caught her breath. The Other Name ... she\u0027d seen that mentioned in the past but had never encountered a whole page devoted to it. Glaeken had mentioned something about each of the Seven who championed the Otherness back in the First Age having a secret name. This could be it. But the text that followed caused her to slam on the brakes.\\n\\n It wasn\u0027t in English.\\n\\n One of the many miraculous things about the Compendium - and what Torquemada must have considered the most Satanic - was its ability to present its text in the reader\u0027s native tongue. Someone born and raised in Riyadh would see Arabic; from the Congo, Swahili; from Johnson, NJ, English.\\n\\n Yet this was in some mishmash of symbols and characters that Weezy had never seen. She had a feeling this was important - so important that she couldn\u0027t risk losing the page. She pulled out her cell phone and began snapping photos. As expected, what she saw as English reverted to the Old Tongue in the photos, but the gibberish remained the same.\\n\\n She couldn\u0027t wait to show Glaeken. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dark-at-the-end/page-9.html","bookId":2554,"book":{"id":2554,"title":"The Dark at the End","description":"Storyline: The Dark at the End (Repairman Jack #15) \\n Bound by his promise to Glaeken, Jack has refrained from making any direct moves against Rasalom. But things have changed so there\u0027s nothing holding Jack in check any longer. Other changes are occurring as well. Jack is healing at an accelerated rate--much like Glaeken did when he was immortal. This can only mean that Glaeken\u0027s time is almost up and when he dies, Jack takes his place. \\n Rasalom continues to plot against the Lady. Twice she has died and returned; a third time and she will be gone, leaving a clear path for the Otherness to infiltrate this reality. But Ernst Drexler, formerly Rasalom\u0027s go-to guy for logistical support, fears he will be left out in the cold when the Change comes. He forms an uneasy alliance with Jack, who is preparing to face their old enemy. \\n Meanwhile, Dawn Pickering is searching for her supposedly dead baby. The trail leads her to a mansion in a remote Long Island coastal town, where she discovers a truth she could have never imagined. \\n Now the stage is set for Jack\u0027s massive assault on Rasalom. Jack knows he\u0027s got just one shot. But it\u0027s not just a matter of taking out Rasalom: he also must safely retrieve Dawn\u0027s child and minimize collateral damage. So, he comes up with a foolproof plan. \\n But fools are always with usâ€¦.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-dark-at-the-end.jpg","author":"F.
