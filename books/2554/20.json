A cut from his conversation with Szeto kept playing and replaying as he walked up from the Lodge toward Allen Street.\\n\\n \"The One speaks to me. He will tell me first.\"\\n\\n \"I thought he spoke to your boss - \"\\n\\n \"No. Speaks to me.\"\\n\\n Couple that with how distracted Drexler had seemed the last time he\u0027d seen him -\\n\\n No, more than distracted - upset. Drexler was pretty damn near the most together, focused guy he\u0027d ever met. But not yesterday. Yesterday he looked like he was being held together by spit and baling wire.\\n\\n Had something gone wrong at the Order? Their High Council had an inside track on everything connected to the Change, and Drexler was Hank\u0027s connection to those bozos. Hank was counting on riding with them to Mover-Shaker status after the Change.\\n\\n But then Drexler had made that \"the most surprised of all\" remark.\\n\\n Hank had to get all this straightened out, and the only guy he knew who could do that was Drexler.\\n\\n But he wasn\u0027t answering his phone. Hank had left half a dozen messages.\\n\\n Only one thing to do. Go over there and get some face time, whether Drexler liked it or not.\\n\\n Hank reached Allen Street and found it at a standstill. Something must have happened on the outward-bound Williamsburg Bridge around the corner. He\u0027d planned on taking a cab but Drexler\u0027s place wasn\u0027t all that far away. He decided to walk. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dark-at-the-end/page-20.html","bookId":2554,"book":{"id":2554,"title":"The Dark at the End","description":"Storyline: The Dark at the End (Repairman Jack #15) \\n Bound by his promise to Glaeken, Jack has refrained from making any direct moves against Rasalom. But things have changed so there\u0027s nothing holding Jack in check any longer. Other changes are occurring as well. Jack is healing at an accelerated rate--much like Glaeken did when he was immortal. This can only mean that Glaeken\u0027s time is almost up and when he dies, Jack takes his place. \\n Rasalom continues to plot against the Lady. Twice she has died and returned; a third time and she will be gone, leaving a clear path for the Otherness to infiltrate this reality. But Ernst Drexler, formerly Rasalom\u0027s go-to guy for logistical support, fears he will be left out in the cold when the Change comes. He forms an uneasy alliance with Jack, who is preparing to face their old enemy. \\n Meanwhile, Dawn Pickering is searching for her supposedly dead baby. The trail leads her to a mansion in a remote Long Island coastal town, where she discovers a truth she could have never imagined. \\n Now the stage is set for Jack\u0027s massive assault on Rasalom. Jack knows he\u0027s got just one shot. But it\u0027s not just a matter of taking out Rasalom: he also must safely retrieve Dawn\u0027s child and minimize collateral damage. So, he comes up with a foolproof plan. \\n But fools are always with usâ€¦.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-dark-at-the-end.jpg","author":"F.
