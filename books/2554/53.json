{"id":111910,"no":53,"title":"Page 53","content":"Dark had fallen extra early due to the storm. Jack debated turning on the mansion\u0027s lights. Would Rasalom be more comfortable entering a lighted house? Most definitely. Jack had done his best to leave everything looking as close as possible to the way he had found it - exactly was not an option. Would the lights increase the chances of Rasalom picking up telltale signs of his handiwork? Certainly, but only incrementally.\n He decided in favor of lights, but only a few, judiciously chosen.\n He made his final walk-through. Everything looked good. Had this been the original plan, and had he had time, he would have photographed every area before starting work, to make sure he\u0027d returned it to its original condition. This was why he hated to improvise.\n His phone rang. He checked the display: Weezy.\n \"Everything okay?\"\n \"Well, no. The roads are bad and getting worse, but I made it.\"\n \"Then what - ?\"\n \"This baby. I don\u0027t know what to do with him. How much - ?\" A screech in the background. \"Oh, God. He\u0027s awake. I gotta go.\"\n The call ended. He closed his phone and checked the display: 6:35. He pulled out Georges\u0027s and Gilda\u0027s phones. He\u0027d turned both off after sending the text messages. Now he turned on Gilda\u0027s for a quick look at the call history. Two missed calls in the past half hour, both from \"Master.\" He powered hers down again and turned on Georges\u0027s. Four calls from \"One.\" He resisted the impulse to listen to Rasalom\u0027s voice mails, which he assumed would ascend in irritation and anger as they progressed. Didn\u0027t want to risk Rasalom getting through. So he turned off that phone as well.\n Yes, sir ... ol\u0027 Rasalom oughta be royally pissed by now. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dark-at-the-end/page-53.html","bookId":2554,"book":{"id":2554,"title":"The Dark at the End","description":"Storyline: \n The Dark at the End (Repairman Jack #15) \n Bound by his promise to Glaeken, Jack has refrained from making any direct moves against Rasalom. But things have changed so there\u0027s nothing holding Jack in check any longer. Other changes are occurring as well. Jack is healing at an accelerated rate--much like Glaeken did when he was immortal. This can only mean that Glaeken\u0027s time is almost up and when he dies, Jack takes his place. \n Rasalom continues to plot against the Lady. Twice she has died and returned; a third time and she will be gone, leaving a clear path for the Otherness to infiltrate this reality. But Ernst Drexler, formerly Rasalom\u0027s go-to guy for logistical support, fears he will be left out in the cold when the Change comes. He forms an uneasy alliance with Jack, who is preparing to face their old enemy. \n Meanwhile, Dawn Pickering is searching for her supposedly dead baby. The trail leads her to a mansion in a remote Long Island coastal town, where she discovers a truth she could have never imagined. \n Now the stage is set for Jack\u0027s massive assault on Rasalom. Jack knows he\u0027s got just one shot. But it\u0027s not just a matter of taking out Rasalom: he also must safely retrieve Dawn\u0027s child and minimize collateral damage. So, he comes up with a foolproof plan. \n But fools are always with usâ€¦.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-dark-at-the-end.jpg","author":"F.
