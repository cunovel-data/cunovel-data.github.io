{"id":111927,"no":71,"title":"Page 71","content":"During the time the cow had cried hysterically over her fallen pet, Rasalom felt the strength pouring into him. Even when her vocalizations ratcheted down to quaking sobs, the grief that poured from her remained considerable.\\n\\n All for a dumb animal that was, in many other countries, considered an entree.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m terribly sorry for your loss,\" he said when she finally quieted.\\n\\n She only moaned.\\n\\n \"My goodness,\" he said. \"I hope it wasn\u0027t my fault.\"\\n\\n Her head snapped up. \"What do you mean?\"\\n\\n \"Well, just before he died I gave him a piece of my turkey.\"\\n\\n She sniffed. \"You did?\"\\n\\n \"Yes. I hope it didn\u0027t cause a reaction or anything. He wasn\u0027t allergic to turkey, was he?\"\\n\\n \"No, he ate it all the time.\" She was staring at him, although he knew he was just a blur to her. \"That turkey was to help you regain your strength, yet you gave him some?\"\\n\\n \"Well, he seemed like such a sweet, loyal dog.\"\\n\\n She began sobbing again.\\n\\n Good ... good. Keep it up. More. Give me more.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m so happy that-that-that his last memory was of a stranger being kind to him.\"\\n\\n His last memory? The cow was pathetic. That creature had been little more than a quadrupedal appetite.\\n\\n She broke down again, bending over the dog, placing her cheek against its back.\\n\\n As Rasalom drank, he lifted the blanket and examined his burns. Healing nicely now.\\n\\n He closed his eyes and sighed as he feasted. Too bad he couldn\u0027t bring the dog back to life - just for a few minutes, just long enough to let her believe her pet was back from the dead - and then stop its heart again.\\n\\n In his previous life he\u0027d been so much more powerful. His very proximity could cause people to turn on each other, commit atrocities they would never dream of had he not entered their lives. He\u0027d been able to make the dead move, walk, appear almost alive, even though they were not. But Glaeken had ended that life and Rasalom had been forced to wait until his rebirth to begin rebuilding his powers.\\n\\n He was not yet powerful enough to make this carcass move. He could end a life, make a life a living hell, but he couldn\u0027t restore a life. Never could. Dead was dead.\\n\\n At least until the Change. After that, who knew? \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dark-at-the-end/page-71.html","bookId":2554,"book":{"id":2554,"title":"The Dark at the End","description":"Storyline: The Dark at the End (Repairman Jack #15) \\n Bound by his promise to Glaeken, Jack has refrained from making any direct moves against Rasalom. But things have changed so there\u0027s nothing holding Jack in check any longer. Other changes are occurring as well. Jack is healing at an accelerated rate--much like Glaeken did when he was immortal. This can only mean that Glaeken\u0027s time is almost up and when he dies, Jack takes his place. \\n Rasalom continues to plot against the Lady. Twice she has died and returned; a third time and she will be gone, leaving a clear path for the Otherness to infiltrate this reality. But Ernst Drexler, formerly Rasalom\u0027s go-to guy for logistical support, fears he will be left out in the cold when the Change comes. He forms an uneasy alliance with Jack, who is preparing to face their old enemy. \\n Meanwhile, Dawn Pickering is searching for her supposedly dead baby. The trail leads her to a mansion in a remote Long Island coastal town, where she discovers a truth she could have never imagined. \\n Now the stage is set for Jack\u0027s massive assault on Rasalom. Jack knows he\u0027s got just one shot. But it\u0027s not just a matter of taking out Rasalom: he also must safely retrieve Dawn\u0027s child and minimize collateral damage. So, he comes up with a foolproof plan. \\n But fools are always with usâ€¦.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-dark-at-the-end.jpg","author":"F.
