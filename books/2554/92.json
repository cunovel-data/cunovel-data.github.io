{"id":111945,"no":92,"title":"Page 92","content":"Perfect. Rasalom removed the earphones and paused to marvel at how everything had fallen into place. His original plan had gone off track in seemingly disastrous directions, and yet somehow ... His original intent had been simply to locate Glaeken. He\u0027d known for years the identity of the Heir, although not where he lived. The plan had hinged on one all-important assumption: that the Heir knew the whereabouts of Glaeken. If that were so, Rasalom could use Dawn\u0027s baby as a means to locate Glaeken through the Heir. From his discussions with Drexler he\u0027d known of the Connell woman\u0027s relationship to the Heir. So he had paired Dawn with the Connell woman, knowing the girl would be needy and would attach herself. He would eventually allow Dawn - with the Connell woman\u0027s help - to find her way back to her baby. The Connell woman would show the q\u0027qrlike child to the Heir. The Heir, if he knew Glaeken\u0027s whereabouts, would want him to see the child. And Rasalom would follow. But the revelations in North Carolina had made all that unnecessary: Glaeken turned out to be an impotent mortal and no threat. Which freed Rasalom to devote all his energies to eliminating the Lady. That was when he realized that Dawn\u0027s baby could be used as a means to that very end. Through the Connell woman, he had learned where the Heir lived - a bit of information crucial to the plan. Once he had established that, he entered her apartment while she was out and inserted a new page about the Other Naming Ceremony into the Compendium, arranging for it to appear whenever the book was opened. The Connell woman couldn\u0027t help but find it, and couldn\u0027t help but bring it to Glaeken\u0027s attention. And to the Lady\u0027s as well, since she was the only living being - aside from Rasalom - who knew the Small Folk\u0027s language. He had worded the page with caveats carefully tailored to leave the q\u0027qrlike child as the only safe recipient of the Other Name. The Heir and the Connell woman would go in search of Rasalom\u0027s ancient sigil, would find what they\u0027d believe was his Other Name, and the Lady would perform the Ceremony. Everything had been working perfectly until the Heir\u0027s ferocious assault almost ruined everything. Almost. Because even though Rasalom had been maimed and had nearly lost his life, it had been worth it. The child had followed the path he\u0027d originally set for it: straight to Glaeken and the Lady. He went down on one knee and opened the case. After all these millennia ... time to end this.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dark-at-the-end/page-92.html","bookId":2554,"book":{"id":2554,"title":"The Dark at the End","description":"Storyline: The Dark at the End (Repairman Jack #15) Bound by his promise to Glaeken, Jack has refrained from making any direct moves against Rasalom. But things have changed so there\u0027s nothing holding Jack in check any longer. Other changes are occurring as well. Jack is healing at an accelerated rate--much like Glaeken did when he was immortal. This can only mean that Glaeken\u0027s time is almost up and when he dies, Jack takes his place. Rasalom continues to plot against the Lady. Twice she has died and returned; a third time and she will be gone, leaving a clear path for the Otherness to infiltrate this reality. But Ernst Drexler, formerly Rasalom\u0027s go-to guy for logistical support, fears he will be left out in the cold when the Change comes. He forms an uneasy alliance with Jack, who is preparing to face their old enemy. Meanwhile, Dawn Pickering is searching for her supposedly dead baby. The trail leads her to a mansion in a remote Long Island coastal town, where she discovers a truth she could have never imagined. Now the stage is set for Jack\u0027s massive assault on Rasalom. Jack knows he\u0027s got just one shot. But it\u0027s not just a matter of taking out Rasalom: he also must safely retrieve Dawn\u0027s child and minimize collateral damage. So, he comes up with a foolproof plan. But fools are always with usâ€¦.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-dark-at-the-end.jpg","author":"F.
