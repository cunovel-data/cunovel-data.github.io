He was too shocked to speak.\n He stared with grief and dismay at Eddie\u0027s severed head, staring blindly into space, at the Lady\u0027s empty, toppled chair and the bloody sword beside it on the floor, and at Weezy\u0027s shuddering, huddled form next to it.\n He and Rasalom had surprised each other numerous times through the millennia of their battle, but this was by far the most devastating blow ever dealt. It surpassed even Glaeken\u0027s imprisoning him in the keep.\n As Rasalom stepped forward Glaeken took in the scars on his face and the absence of his left hand. Jack must have come close ... so close.\n \"What\u0027s that you say?\" He leaned close, grinning. \"I didn\u0027t catch it.\"\n Still Glaeken said nothing. He had no defiance left.\n Over ... after all this time, it was finally over. A spark of relief flashed within but he doused it. Yes, he was tired of the endless struggle, exhausted from it, but he couldn\u0027t allow himself to welcome its end - not when the Otherness had won.\n Weezy moaned, and now he had to speak.\n \"Let her go.\"\n Rasalom shook his head. \"Her agony is tasty, but I have another, more important reason to keep her alive.\"\n \"Jack?\"\n \"The Heir ... yes. I want him to find her like this, I want the agony of his loss, I want to feel his unfounded guilt that if only he\u0027d been here things would have been different, when in truth, I\u0027d have frozen him just like you.\"\n Glaeken knew what would come next. \"And then you\u0027ll kill us, slowly.\"\n \"Yes. As you know, I never forgive, never forget. But I\u0027ll save that pleasure for later. He has people he loves. One of them writhes in agony behind me, but there are others. The woman and child will go first, and slowly. And he will watch. Then he will go, even more slowly. And you will watch. Because he\u0027s your heir, and because you love him, don\u0027t you. Love him like a son.\"\n Glaeken blinked in shock. He\u0027d never seen their relationship in those terms, but now that he thought of it, yes ... Jack was like a son.\n \"And after your son is dismembered, you\u0027ll watch your wife die.\"\n He cringed at the thought, but took infinitesimal consolation in the fact that Magda\u0027s limited awareness would spare her the worst of it.\n \"But before her agonies begin, I will restore her mind.\"\n \"Impossible.\"\n The grin broadened. \"At this moment, yes. But I will transform during the Change, and in my new form I will be able to perform\" - he spread the fingers of his remaining hand - \"miracles. Remember: I never forgive, never forget. And I well remember how that bitch delayed my exit from the keep. If not for her, I would have escaped before you arrived, and everything would have been so different.\"\n Now Glaeken could smile. \"You did your damnedest, but she withstood everything you threw at her.\"\n Glaeken remembered Magda\u0027s courage, how she\u0027d stood like a lone Spartan with the gate of the keep as her Thermopylae.\n \"You will both pay for that. And she will be aware of every torment I inflict on her, and will know it is all because of you. That is perhaps the best part: When your loved ones begin to curse you - not me - as the cause of their agonies.\"\n Glaeken didn\u0027t care about himself, but poor Magda ...\n \"But none of this will take place,\" Rasalom went on, \"until the Change is well under way. Before your personal agonies begin, I want you to have a front-row seat from your big windows upstairs as the reality you\u0027ve protected for so long is transformed into something incomprehensible.\"\n Glaeken shook his head. \"Gloating becomes you.\"\n \"Why shouldn\u0027t I gloat? I manipulated you and your pathetic band like a maestro directs an orchestra. I\u0027ll even bet it was you who suggested that the baby carry my Other Name.\"\n Glaeken realized with a dismay that the suggestion had indeed come from him.\n \"Am I so predictable?\"\n \"Yes! You\u0027ve always tried to avoid collateral damage, and dubbing a nearly mindless human-q\u0027qr hybrid was the perfect solution. That helps me in so many ways. The Heir made the same mistake. If he\u0027d concentrated all the massive firepower he\u0027d assembled upon my car as I arrived, I would be cinders now and we wouldn\u0027t be having this conversation. I\u0027m sure he considered it, just as I\u0027m sure he discarded it for my driver\u0027s sake.\"\n \"We\u0027re trying to preserve this world, and those in it, and so we have different rules of engagement.\"\n \"And that is why I was always destined to win, Glaeken.\"\n \"We follow a code - \"\n \"And where has it gotten you? You\u0027ve lost everything - quite literally, everything.\"\n He began to pace before Glaeken.\n \"Yes, I should gloat! When I learned of the Gaijin Masamune, I knew it had been repurposed from one of your blades, made of steel from a meteor. And then I learned of the heavily Tainted baby conceived as a result of my old protector and betrayer, Jonah Stevens. Suddenly I saw the possibilities. Nothing of this Earth can harm the Lady, but a sword made of steel not of this Earth could cut her. But would it kill her? Perhaps if coated with tainted blood that is not wholly of this Earth, it might very well inflict a third and final death upon her. And I was right. I was right!\"\n Glaeken realized that Rasalom had no one to celebrate with, so he was celebrating with Glaeken.\n \"It\u0027s over, Glaeken. You\u0027ve lost. The Change is imminent now. Remember what I told you in North Carolina: It will begin in the heavens.\" He looked around, as if sniffing the air. \"I should go. The Heir will be here soon.\"\n \"Afraid to face him?\"\n \"Hardly.\" He turned and headed for the door. \"But if he sees me he will be all rage, which will overcome the tastier, more delicate agonies he\u0027ll exude when he cradles one of the great loves of his life in his arms and watches helpless as she dies.\"\n Jack loving Weezy ... yes, Glaeken could see that, even if Jack couldn\u0027t.\n Rasalom\u0027s cruelty was truly boundless.\n As if to prove that, Rasalom turned at the door and added, \"And you, Glaeken ... until the Heir arrives, you will stay silent in that chair and watch the woman suffer and be able to do nothing to comfort her.\"\n With that he was gone. Glaeken tried to move but could not, tried to call for help but could not.\n He could only listen to Weezy\u0027s agonized moans and watch her writhe in pain ... \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dark-at-the-end/page-94.html","bookId":2554,"book":{"id":2554,"title":"The Dark at the End","description":"Storyline: \n The Dark at the End (Repairman Jack #15) \n Bound by his promise to Glaeken, Jack has refrained from making any direct moves against Rasalom. But things have changed so there\u0027s nothing holding Jack in check any longer. Other changes are occurring as well. Jack is healing at an accelerated rate--much like Glaeken did when he was immortal. This can only mean that Glaeken\u0027s time is almost up and when he dies, Jack takes his place. \n Rasalom continues to plot against the Lady. Twice she has died and returned; a third time and she will be gone, leaving a clear path for the Otherness to infiltrate this reality. But Ernst Drexler, formerly Rasalom\u0027s go-to guy for logistical support, fears he will be left out in the cold when the Change comes. He forms an uneasy alliance with Jack, who is preparing to face their old enemy. \n Meanwhile, Dawn Pickering is searching for her supposedly dead baby. The trail leads her to a mansion in a remote Long Island coastal town, where she discovers a truth she could have never imagined. \n Now the stage is set for Jack\u0027s massive assault on Rasalom. Jack knows he\u0027s got just one shot. But it\u0027s not just a matter of taking out Rasalom: he also must safely retrieve Dawn\u0027s child and minimize collateral damage. So, he comes up with a foolproof plan. \n But fools are always with usâ€¦.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-dark-at-the-end.jpg","author":"F.
