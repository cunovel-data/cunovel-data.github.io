{"id":111933,"no":78,"title":"Page 78","content":"Sunrise.\n Rasalom stood in the cow\u0027s kitchen and watched the sky turn bright orange above the watery horizon. By noon - if the storm hadn\u0027t changed the boat\u0027s schedule - it would arrive at her dock and he would be bound for the mainland.\n Her phone service had returned last night and he\u0027d put in a call to Szeto. He\u0027d been satisfied with his performance in the probe against the Lady - proof beyond doubt that the Fhinntmanchca had not altered her invulnerability to Earthly assault. He seemed competent, ruthless, and enthusiastic - an excellent melange of qualities - and so Rasalom had rewarded him with another assignment.\n But Szeto had not answered, and had not returned the call despite a message to contact him immediately.\n Rasalom sighed. He supposed he would have to call Drexler. He knew his anger at the man was unjustified. His behavior had been exemplary in procuring the Orsa and creating the Fhinntmanchca. Not his fault that it failed to eliminate the Lady. And he had achieved the seemingly impossible by bringing down the Internet, albeit briefly. But long enough to further bloody an already hemorrhaging noosphere.\n And yet, the Lady persisted.\n Rasalom did not understand how. He could only assume that she had somehow evolved to a point where she could exist independently of the noosphere.\n Again, not Drexler\u0027s fault.\n Yet Rasalom had vented his rage and frustration on the man, had been ready to tear him limb from limb. But he had restrained himself at the last moment. And now he was glad he had. Never discard a tool for which you might find future use.\n He punched Drexler\u0027s number into the cow\u0027s phone.\n \"Hello?\"\n His tone was appropriately cautious. He would not recognize the number on his caller ID.\n \"Drexler, I have a task for you.\"\n A few heartbeats of confused silence, then, \"Sir! Of course! What do you wish?\"\n \"I want you to meet me at the Water Street docks in Sag Harbor. Leave in plenty of time to reach the docks by noon and wait for me there.\"\n He supposed he could have hired a cab, but he had no money, and even if he did, he did not want to be seen by any more people than absolutely necessary. Besides, Drexler\u0027s Bentley was very comfortable.\n \"Yes, sir. Immediately. I ... we heard about the house. We thought - \"\n \"We will discuss that in the car. For that reason you will leave your driver and come alone.\"\n \"Of course. I am very glad to hear from you. We feared the worst.\"\n \"Yes. I\u0027m sure.\"\n He hung up.\n How pathetically eager to please. Right now Drexler would do anything, perhaps even rape his mother, to return to the good graces of the One. He and the other higher members of the Septimus Order who knew of the Otherness and the Change were under the impression they would be given special treatment once the Change began. Rasalom encouraged that belief. It made them willing participants in their own demise.\n But only the One would change with the Change.\n Or so he had been led to believe.\n What if the Otherness had been toying with him all these millennia? While improbable, it was not impossible. This was not the first time he had confronted the possibility, but he had no way to answer the question, so he let it go. He would continue on this path. Divergence, after all this time, was unthinkable.\n He heard the woman stirring in her room. Last night he had slipped in while she was sleeping and laid his hand on her head. Soon she would realize what he\u0027d done to her.\n \"Oh, dear God! Dear God!\"\n There.\n He heard the approach of her scurrying footsteps as she continued to cry out to her deity.\n \"Praise God! Praise him!\"\n She hurtled into the kitchen and skidded to a halt before him.\n \"I can see!\" Tears coursed down her cheeks. \"Dear God, I can see! It\u0027s a miracle!\"\n \"You could see before,\" he said, maintaining a bland, unimpressed air. \"You inspected my wounds many times and - \"\n \"I could see blurry shapes and maybe a little more close up, but now I can really see! Everything is perfectly clear! It\u0027s a miracle!\"\n Her joy was nauseating.\n \"Whatever was afflicting you has cleared up. That is hardly divine intervention.\"\n \"Don\u0027t you understand? I had AMD and it\u0027s incurable. Now I can see. I call that a miracle!\"\n \"As you wish.\"\n Her gaze narrowed. \"Are you an angel?\"\n He hadn\u0027t seen that one coming.\n \"A what?\"\n \"An angel, sent here by God to test me?\"\n \"That is perhaps the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard.\"\n \"No ... it makes sense to me now. God washed you up on shore to see if I\u0027d be a good Samaritan and take care of you. And I did. So then He took Rocky from me to test me further. But still I didn\u0027t reject Him. And so now I\u0027m rewarded with my sight. Praise God!\"\n \"Well, if I\u0027m his angel, I wish he\u0027d give me back my hand.\" He remembered his cover story and forced a sob. \"Or even better ... my family.\"\n The cow added a sob of her own. \"And I\u0027d give up my sight if I could have Rocky back.\"\n \"Maybe God has a mission for you that requires sight.\"\n She brightened. \"You think so? I could be God\u0027s instrument ... I could do His work.\"\n \"Yes. That would be wonderful.\"\n She looked around and made a face. \"Having sight has its disadvantages. Look at this mess. I couldn\u0027t see the dirt before. This place needs a good scrubbing.\"\n As she bustled off, Rasalom could not help but smile at the cow\u0027s comment.\n Having sight has its disadvantages ...\n She could not realize how true those words, for she would curse her sight and beg her god for return of her blindness when the horrors of the Change reached her little island. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dark-at-the-end/page-78.html","bookId":2554,"book":{"id":2554,"title":"The Dark at the End","description":"Storyline: \n The Dark at the End (Repairman Jack #15) \n Bound by his promise to Glaeken, Jack has refrained from making any direct moves against Rasalom. But things have changed so there\u0027s nothing holding Jack in check any longer. Other changes are occurring as well. Jack is healing at an accelerated rate--much like Glaeken did when he was immortal. This can only mean that Glaeken\u0027s time is almost up and when he dies, Jack takes his place. \n Rasalom continues to plot against the Lady. Twice she has died and returned; a third time and she will be gone, leaving a clear path for the Otherness to infiltrate this reality. But Ernst Drexler, formerly Rasalom\u0027s go-to guy for logistical support, fears he will be left out in the cold when the Change comes. He forms an uneasy alliance with Jack, who is preparing to face their old enemy. \n Meanwhile, Dawn Pickering is searching for her supposedly dead baby. The trail leads her to a mansion in a remote Long Island coastal town, where she discovers a truth she could have never imagined. \n Now the stage is set for Jack\u0027s massive assault on Rasalom. Jack knows he\u0027s got just one shot. But it\u0027s not just a matter of taking out Rasalom: he also must safely retrieve Dawn\u0027s child and minimize collateral damage. So, he comes up with a foolproof plan. \n But fools are always with usâ€¦.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-dark-at-the-end.jpg","author":"F.
