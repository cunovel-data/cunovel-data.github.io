He\u0027d forgotten about it because the pain was gone. This was scary. \"Just a scratch.\" At least it was now. Slim, with short blond hair and sky-blue eyes, Gia sat next to him on her bed. Vicky was asleep and they were enjoying a little private time. \"When? I don\u0027t remember this yesterday.\" She removed her top and unfastened her bra as he gave her a quick rundown of the incident in Central Park. Her pink-tipped breasts weren\u0027t large and weren\u0027t small. A handful each ... just right. Her blue eyes were wide. \"That shoot-out in the park? That was you?\" \"I was just walking by - \" \"How do you manage to get involved in these things?\" \"I was minding my own business.\" He was reaching for one of her breasts but she pushed his hand away and leaned close, studying the wound. \"The news said a man was killed. That could have been you.\" She frowned. \"This looks almost healed.\" \"Told you it was just a scratch. Doc Hargus said it hardly needed the butterflies.\" To prove his point, Jack pulled them off. \"There.\" He stared at the wound. No way the healing should be this far gone. \"You do heal fast.\" Jack opened his mouth to tell her, but closed it again. Why try to explain what he didn\u0027t know for sure, what he only suspected? He\u0027d talk to Glaeken first and see what he thought. She ran a finger lightly along the line of the wound. \"That other bullet scar is round.\" \"That was a direct hit. This was a graze.\" \"Looks like something a knife might make.\" He\u0027d expected her to be repulsed, and maybe if the wound looked fresher, she would be. But she seemed fascinated. \"Or a sword.\" \"Sword?\" He laughed. \"Where\u0027d that come from?\" \"I guess I have swords on my mind,\" she said as she slipped out of her jeans. \"I mean, since Vicky asked if I thought you\u0027d mind if she brought your katana into school for show and tell.\" \"The Gaijin Masamune?\" \"Whatever.\" \"How does she know about that?\" \"Well, it\u0027s visible on the top shelf of your front closet. Every time we hang up our coats - \" \"Okay, okay. But how does she even know what a katana is?\" \"A combination of things. They\u0027re studying Japan in school, and today she happened to catch some of The Seven Samurai on TV.\" \"But she hates black-and-white films.\" He remembered how he\u0027d had to bribe her to watch the original King Kong. \"Well, she didn\u0027t watch for long, and I\u0027m pretty sure she would have flipped right past if they hadn\u0027t been studying Japan. But she lasted long enough to recognize the swords in the samurais\u0027 belts as just like the one in your closet.\" \"And she wants to bring it to class?\" She slipped out of her panties. \"Don\u0027t worry. I\u0027ve already told her it\u0027s not going to happen. Not with the schools\u0027 zero-tolerance policy.\" He couldn\u0027t take his eyes off her. \"Right. They get freaked about toy light sabers. Imagine something that can really lop off limbs and heads. Besides, it\u0027s pretty messed up.\" Gia kissed his wound. \"Not like your other sword.\" \"What other sword?\" She kissed his chest. \"The pretty one. The one that only I see.\" \"Oh ... that one.\" His skin tingled at her touch. \"Yes, that one. How\u0027s it doing?\" \"Ready for battle.\" She pushed him back and trailed her lips down along his abdomen. \"I sure hope so...\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dark-at-the-end/page-11.html","bookId":2554,"book":{"id":2554,"title":"The Dark at the End","description":"Storyline: The Dark at the End (Repairman Jack #15) Bound by his promise to Glaeken, Jack has refrained from making any direct moves against Rasalom. But things have changed so there\u0027s nothing holding Jack in check any longer. Other changes are occurring as well. Jack is healing at an accelerated rate--much like Glaeken did when he was immortal. This can only mean that Glaeken\u0027s time is almost up and when he dies, Jack takes his place. Rasalom continues to plot against the Lady. Twice she has died and returned; a third time and she will be gone, leaving a clear path for the Otherness to infiltrate this reality. But Ernst Drexler, formerly Rasalom\u0027s go-to guy for logistical support, fears he will be left out in the cold when the Change comes. He forms an uneasy alliance with Jack, who is preparing to face their old enemy. Meanwhile, Dawn Pickering is searching for her supposedly dead baby. The trail leads her to a mansion in a remote Long Island coastal town, where she discovers a truth she could have never imagined. Now the stage is set for Jack\u0027s massive assault on Rasalom. Jack knows he\u0027s got just one shot. But it\u0027s not just a matter of taking out Rasalom: he also must safely retrieve Dawn\u0027s child and minimize collateral damage. So, he comes up with a foolproof plan. But fools are always with usâ€¦.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-dark-at-the-end.jpg","author":"F.
