{"id":111918,"no":61,"title":"Page 61","content":"Plenty on the late-night news about the destruction and dead bodies out in Nuckateague, but nothing about a survivor. Jack didn\u0027t know if that was good or not. If they found an unidentified man hovering near death, he\u0027d know where to go and what to do to finish the job. If they didn\u0027t, it meant Rasalom was still out in the storm, burned, battered, barely breathing - and ready to breathe his last, Jack hoped. He rose and grabbed his jacket. \"I might as well head out.\" \"Stopping in to see your ladies?\" \"Nah. Don\u0027t think I\u0027m good company tonight.\" \"You need them.\" \"But they don\u0027t need me. Not like this.\" Glaeken was staring at him. \"Are you all right, Jack? I ask this knowing the answer.\" \"Well, if you know the answer, why are you asking?\" \"Because I\u0027m curious about the reason. I understand you\u0027re angry and disappointed and frustrated about tonight - \" \"Do you? Can you? I threw every goddamn thing I had at him - everything short of a tactical nuke - and you tell me the son of a bitch is still breathing.\" \"You haven\u0027t failed yet. He still might - \" \"Not knowing is driving me nuts.\" \"All the more reason to be with people who love you.\" \"They won\u0027t want to be with me very long. Even I don\u0027t want to be with me tonight. So rather than alienate them, I figure it\u0027s better I keep to myself.\" The old man continued his annoying stare. \"This isn\u0027t like you, Jack.\" \"Yeah? Well, I\u0027m not feeling much like me lately.\" \"Oh?\" He looked at the finger he\u0027d cut batting away the knife Georges had thrown. Pretty much completely healed now. \"I told you about the healing bit.\" Glaeken nodded. \"Not good news for either of us.\" \"Got that right.\" Glaeken on his way out and Jack being pushed someplace he didn\u0027t want to go. \"But what\u0027s happening seems more than physical.\" Another nod. \"A certain ... ruthlessness?\" \"Right again.\" \"That\u0027s part of it. As your recuperative abilities increase, your empathy diminishes.\" \"So it\u0027s not just me.\" \"No. It\u0027s the Ally, or whatever infinitesimal fragment of it remains with this world. To be the Defender you must not only be physically resilient but you must have a singleness of purpose. As you\u0027ve so painfully discovered, the Ally cares not a whit for us as individuals, only that we survive as a species to keep this corner of reality sentient.\" \"\u0027A spear has no branches.\u0027\" The phrase tasted bitter. \"Correct. Nor should said spear have any concern beyond hitting the target.\" Jack shook his head. So that was why he\u0027d considered setting out the shaped IEDs anyway, even if it meant sacrificing an innocent driver. And why he\u0027d been kicking himself on the way home for not doing it. \"How do you fight that? How do you resist something that sneaks up on you and gets into your head and changes your perspective?\" Glaeken sighed. \"With great difficulty. Because you don\u0027t feel it. You think it\u0027s right and natural. You think it\u0027s you. And in a way, it is. There\u0027s a darkness in all of us that will gladly use the end to justify any means.\" \"What you call \u0027darkness,\u0027 I call the brain.\" \"Ah, science. Stealing the mysteries from life.\" \"More like providing an antidote for magic.\" \"But \u0027darkness\u0027 is so much more picturesque, so much more evocative.\" \"You can\u0027t get much darker than the human brain. It\u0027s got no conscience. It wants what it wants when it wants it, but most of all it wants to survive, and will do whatever\u0027s necessary to preserve itself. But then there\u0027s the mind...\" \"That which makes us sentient, which sees a bigger picture, a different perspective. You can\u0027t allow the darkness - or your brain - to overrule your mind.\" He shook his head. \"But it\u0027s not easy. Back in the First Age, a number of us were chosen to lead the battle against the Seven - when Rasalom still counted himself in their number. Some of us succumbed to the influence, willing to sacrifice strings of innocent villages in order to win a single battle, becoming nearly indistinguishable from those we were fighting.\" Jack thought of Glaeken\u0027s love for his wife and his continued devotion to her demented shell. \"You seemed to have succeeded.\" \"The best weapon is awareness. Knowing that your perspectives and values are being subverted forces you to question yourself. Preserve the real you early on, and that is the person who will prevail.\" Jack slipped into his jacket. \"I still don\u0027t want to subject anyone to my presence tonight.\" Glaeken smiled. \"See? You\u0027re winning the battle already.\" \"What about tonight\u0027s battle? You still sense him out there?\" Glaeken\u0027s smile faded as he nodded. Shit. Jack took the elevator down and trudged out into the storm. The falling snow muffled the sounds of the city. He\u0027d garaged the car before coming to Glaeken\u0027s. The trunk had a special lock and he had the only keys. The Nuckateague evidence would be safe until he disposed of it. A cab cruised by but he let it go. He lived twenty-some blocks from here. Might as well walk. To Julio\u0027s? Nah. Just home. He always had beer in the fridge. He hoped the walk would tire him. Fat chance. He had a feeling he wouldn\u0027t sleep much tonight. Probably stay up listening to the radio for word of a survivor in Nuckateague. Jack couldn\u0027t stand the fact that this wasn\u0027t over. It had to be over. His phone rang. He checked the display: Gia. \"Hi. Home safe?\" \"No. We\u0027ve decided to spend the night at Weezy\u0027s.\" No! He resisted an urge to shout into the phone. \"Bad idea.\" A pause, then, \"Why do you say that?\" \"The farther you and Vicky are from that kid, the better.\" \"He\u0027s just a baby. And Vicky has such a great effect on him, we figured it would make things a whole lot easier for Weezy if we stayed.\" Jack\u0027s turn to pause. Maybe it was okay if they stayed. He didn\u0027t see how anyone in the Order could connect Weezy with the baby. Still, he had a bad feeling about that child, that it was some sort of lightning rod for disaster. \"Stop over,\" Gia said. \"Maybe I\u0027ll do that.\" Even though he wouldn\u0027t be good company, he wanted to stay close to Gia and Vicky. So he\u0027d do more than stop by. If they were sleeping over, so would he.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dark-at-the-end/page-61.html","bookId":2554,"book":{"id":2554,"title":"The Dark at the End","description":"Storyline: The Dark at the End (Repairman Jack #15) Bound by his promise to Glaeken, Jack has refrained from making any direct moves against Rasalom. But things have changed so there\u0027s nothing holding Jack in check any longer. Other changes are occurring as well. Jack is healing at an accelerated rate--much like Glaeken did when he was immortal. This can only mean that Glaeken\u0027s time is almost up and when he dies, Jack takes his place. Rasalom continues to plot against the Lady. Twice she has died and returned; a third time and she will be gone, leaving a clear path for the Otherness to infiltrate this reality. But Ernst Drexler, formerly Rasalom\u0027s go-to guy for logistical support, fears he will be left out in the cold when the Change comes. He forms an uneasy alliance with Jack, who is preparing to face their old enemy. Meanwhile, Dawn Pickering is searching for her supposedly dead baby. The trail leads her to a mansion in a remote Long Island coastal town, where she discovers a truth she could have never imagined. Now the stage is set for Jack\u0027s massive assault on Rasalom. Jack knows he\u0027s got just one shot. But it\u0027s not just a matter of taking out Rasalom: he also must safely retrieve Dawn\u0027s child and minimize collateral damage. So, he comes up with a foolproof plan. But fools are always with usâ€¦.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-dark-at-the-end.jpg","author":"F.
