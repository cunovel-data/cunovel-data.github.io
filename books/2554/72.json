He realized he should not have been surprised. Glaeken had wanted the child removed from the picture.\\n\\n He put an arm around her shoulder as she stared down at the baby.\\n\\n \"I know how you felt about Dawn,\" he said, \"so I\u0027ve a pretty good idea what you\u0027re thinking.\"\\n\\n \"Do you?\" Her voice carried an edge. \"Putting an infant in danger. Really?\"\\n\\n \"Listen. Yes, he\u0027s a baby, but that is why he will not be in danger: He\u0027s not sentient yet. With all that q\u0027qr blood flowing through him, he will most likely never be sentient in the fully human sense. And that\u0027s the beauty part. The ceremony can be performed on him and he\u0027ll have no cognizance of it. If he\u0027s even listening during the ceremony, which I doubt, he\u0027ll hear that name then and never again. He\u0027ll certainly never be called by that name. He\u0027ll have no idea that it\u0027s even a name. He\u0027ll hear it as background noise, just as he\u0027s hearing this conversation. It won\u0027t register in his conscious or subconscious. He\u0027ll never even know he\u0027s been through a ceremony.\"\\n\\n \"And yet,\" the Lady said, raising a finger, \"if what Srem says is true, once that infant has gone through the Naming Ceremony, he will render the One powerless.\"\\n\\n Weezy turned to Jack. \"What do you think?\"\\n\\n He found he had no easy answer. And their decision here would have momentous impact.\\n\\n \"Let me think out loud here.\" He couldn\u0027t stand still so he wandered the room. \"First off, am I right in saying the Lady won\u0027t perform the ceremony on anyone else?\"\\n\\n The Lady nodded. \"Correct.\"\\n\\n \"And it\u0027s also a fact that if something happens to the Lady, no one else can perform the ceremony?\"\\n\\n He stopped and looked at Glaeken and the Lady. Both nodded.\\n\\n Moving again, he said, \"Now, because we\u0027re on terra incognita here, we can\u0027t say it\u0027s a fact, but it seems a good bet that of everyone in this room, maybe even the world, this little guy here has the best chance of safely taking on Rasalom\u0027s Other Name.\" He pointed to Eddie. \"Actuarial opinion?\"\\n\\n Eddie glanced at Weezy, then away. \"Given the information at hand, true.\"\\n\\n Jack turned to Weezy but said nothing. After a long pause, she gave a reluctant shrug. \"I suppose so.\"\\n\\n \"So, if we do do it, Rasalom will no longer be the One, rendering him \u0027powerless\u0027 to start the Change. Not being the One might also rob him of some of his extra-human abilities as well, making him easier to take down next time we get a crack at him. Realizing he\u0027s no longer the One has got to distract him, sending him searching for whoever else has his Other Name instead of plotting against the Lady. That search will bring him out in the open, making him an easier target.\"\\n\\n Jack paused. He had to admit those were strong arguments.\\n\\n \"Okay,\" he went on. \"If we don\u0027t do it, it\u0027s business as usual for Rasalom: He\u0027s still the One and once he heals up he can go to ground and redouble his efforts against the Lady with no worries.\" He looked Weezy in the eyes. \"Considering what\u0027s at stake, the effect on billions of lives if Rasalom brings the Change, I don\u0027t see how we can not do it.\"\\n\\n Jack watched her stare down at the baby as he scored the bone with his sharp little teeth. He thought of another child: Vicky. She was the child he cared about. And after what Jack had done to Rasalom the other night, he had no doubt that if or when he brought the Change, he\u0027d reserve a special place in that particular hell for anyone Jack held dear.\\n\\n Rasalom had to be stopped.\\n\\n But he said nothing. He had to let Weezy work this through.\\n\\n \"With so much at stake,\" she finally said, shaking her head, \"how can I object?\"\\n\\n He sighed. \"Okay. It\u0027s settled then. That means we\u0027re looking at another trip to Johnson to find that sigil.\"\\n\\n Her eyebrows rose. \"Oh? Yesterday you refused to go.\"\\n\\n \"Yesterday we had no possible use for it. That\u0027s changed.\"\\n\\n \"Well, I\u0027m set to go. I was getting ready to leave when you called.\"\\n\\n \"Alone?\"\\n\\n \"No. Eddie offered to go with me.\"\\n\\n He turned to Eddie. \"You don\u0027t have to now.\"\\n\\n \"No, I want to go,\" he said. \"I haven\u0027t been back in a while.\"\\n\\n Jack shrugged. \"Well, the more the merrier, I guess. I\u0027ll throw some stuff together and we\u0027ll leave this afternoon.\"\\n\\n He had a strange feeling that a circle was closing: the three of them back in Johnson, back in the Lodge. Like old times.\\n\\n Except the fate of the world hadn\u0027t hung in the balance then. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dark-at-the-end/page-72.html","bookId":2554,"book":{"id":2554,"title":"The Dark at the End","description":"Storyline: The Dark at the End (Repairman Jack #15) \\n Bound by his promise to Glaeken, Jack has refrained from making any direct moves against Rasalom. But things have changed so there\u0027s nothing holding Jack in check any longer. Other changes are occurring as well. Jack is healing at an accelerated rate--much like Glaeken did when he was immortal. This can only mean that Glaeken\u0027s time is almost up and when he dies, Jack takes his place. \\n Rasalom continues to plot against the Lady. Twice she has died and returned; a third time and she will be gone, leaving a clear path for the Otherness to infiltrate this reality. But Ernst Drexler, formerly Rasalom\u0027s go-to guy for logistical support, fears he will be left out in the cold when the Change comes. He forms an uneasy alliance with Jack, who is preparing to face their old enemy. \\n Meanwhile, Dawn Pickering is searching for her supposedly dead baby. The trail leads her to a mansion in a remote Long Island coastal town, where she discovers a truth she could have never imagined. \\n Now the stage is set for Jack\u0027s massive assault on Rasalom. Jack knows he\u0027s got just one shot. But it\u0027s not just a matter of taking out Rasalom: he also must safely retrieve Dawn\u0027s child and minimize collateral damage. So, he comes up with a foolproof plan. \\n But fools are always with usâ€¦.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-dark-at-the-end.jpg","author":"F.
