{"id":111879,"no":19,"title":"Page 19","content":"Dawn followed Dr. Heinze through the Midtown Tunnel onto the Long Island Expressway. Her stomach totally knotted when he turned off on Woodhaven Boulevard and headed south into Rego Park. She\u0027d grown up in this area. He continued on to Forest Hills where he eventually parked his car in the driveway of a two-story brick house with a manicured lawn and shrubbery that probably looked beautiful in season. Home again, home again, jiggety-jig. Now where had that come from? Oh, yeah. Her mother used to recite that nursery rhyme line every time they pulled into their driveway. Dawn\u0027s throat tightened. God, how she missed her. She shook it off and stared at the house. Well, Dr. Heinze, I now know where you live. What she was going to do with that information, Dawn hadn\u0027t a clue, but she tucked the address away, just in case ... She wound her way back to Queens Boulevard and Rego Park, and slowed as she passed the Tower Diner where she used to wait tables ... where she first met Jerry Bethlehem or whatever his real name was ... where he started spinning the lies that led her into his bed and got her pregnant with the child she was now chasing. Full circle. Her hands seemed to have a life of their own as they turned the wheel, taking her off Queens Boulevard into the confusing local residential streets. She headed for 68th Drive, which paralleled 68th Road and 68th Avenue. She slowed before an older, stucco-walled house with high-peaked gables and an attached two-car garage. On impulse she pulled into the driveway. Home again, home again, jiggety-jig. Mom\u0027s house. The house Dawn had left to move in with Jerry. She remembered it being better kept, then realized it had been almost a year since her mother had died in there, leaving a huge hole in her life. A sob burst from her as she saw the foreclosure sign. Mom had loved that place, had worked so hard to earn it, and now ... She stared at the darkened windows. What would you do, Mom? Would you tell me to find my baby or let him go? Dawn realized her mother might very well tell her to let him go. She\u0027d warned her against Jerry from the get-go, but Dawn wouldn\u0027t listen. And Dawn was totally sure she\u0027d tell her now that nothing good could ever come from something that came from Jerry. And maybe she was right. But I can\u0027t let it go, Mom. I can\u0027t. A car pulled out of a driveway two doors down - the Schanz house. It turned this way and slowed as it approached, the driver probably wondering about a car parked outside the deserted Pickering place. Dawn\u0027s pulse picked up as she recognized Mrs. Schanz behind the wheel. Couldn\u0027t be seen here by that old busybody - not when she was a \"person of interest\" in her mother\u0027s death. She turned her head, praying the biddy wouldn\u0027t recognize her in the failing light. After Mrs. Schanz moved on, Dawn backed out and gunned away. She headed back to Manhattan, but she\u0027d be back in the morning to trail Dr. Heinze from his house to the foundation - just to make sure he didn\u0027t make any stops between. She shook her head, realizing how this had totally become a sickness. But she couldn\u0027t let go. She couldn\u0027t.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dark-at-the-end/page-19.html","bookId":2554,"book":{"id":2554,"title":"The Dark at the End","description":"Storyline: The Dark at the End (Repairman Jack #15) Bound by his promise to Glaeken, Jack has refrained from making any direct moves against Rasalom. But things have changed so there\u0027s nothing holding Jack in check any longer. Other changes are occurring as well. Jack is healing at an accelerated rate--much like Glaeken did when he was immortal. This can only mean that Glaeken\u0027s time is almost up and when he dies, Jack takes his place. Rasalom continues to plot against the Lady. Twice she has died and returned; a third time and she will be gone, leaving a clear path for the Otherness to infiltrate this reality. But Ernst Drexler, formerly Rasalom\u0027s go-to guy for logistical support, fears he will be left out in the cold when the Change comes. He forms an uneasy alliance with Jack, who is preparing to face their old enemy. Meanwhile, Dawn Pickering is searching for her supposedly dead baby. The trail leads her to a mansion in a remote Long Island coastal town, where she discovers a truth she could have never imagined. Now the stage is set for Jack\u0027s massive assault on Rasalom. Jack knows he\u0027s got just one shot. But it\u0027s not just a matter of taking out Rasalom: he also must safely retrieve Dawn\u0027s child and minimize collateral damage.
