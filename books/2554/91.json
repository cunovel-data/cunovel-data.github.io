He\u0027s back in the city and he\u0027s damaged, but he is strong again.\"\n \"Where in the city?\" Eddie said. He looked frightened.\n Glaeken shrugged. \"I\u0027ve never been able to pinpoint his location. I know only that he is here.\"\n \"Weezy...\" Eddie drew out her name. \"If he\u0027s nearby and he finds out what we\u0027ve got planned, no telling what he\u0027ll do.\"\n \"I told Jack we\u0027d wait.\"\n Eddie gave her a look. \"Is that really what this is about?\" He nodded at the baby. \"Or are you just postponing the inevitable?\"\n Was that it? Was she delaying the Ceremony just because of the baby?\n \"Jack could be in jail, for all we know,\" Eddie added. \"We\u0027ve got to get this done.\"\n \"I agree,\" the Lady said. \"We have all we need here to perform the Ceremony.\"\n Weezy looked around the room. Looked like she was outvoted.\n She sighed. \"All right. Let\u0027s do it.\" She looked at the Lady. \"What\u0027s the first step?\"\n \"According to the Compendium, the baby must be seated on the lap of whoever recites the Ceremony. That would be me.\"\n While Eddie pulled one of the wooden chairs away from the table, Weezy stepped to the playpen and lifted the baby. He loosed one of his ear-piercing shrieks as he lost his grip on his bone. Weezy quickly retrieved it for him and returned to where the Lady was seating herself on the chair. Weezy set the baby on her lap. The Lady faced him outward and wrapped her arms around him.\n \"Now ... hold the Compendium before me so I can see the words...\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dark-at-the-end/page-91.html","bookId":2554,"book":{"id":2554,"title":"The Dark at the End","description":"Storyline: \n The Dark at the End (Repairman Jack #15) \n Bound by his promise to Glaeken, Jack has refrained from making any direct moves against Rasalom. But things have changed so there\u0027s nothing holding Jack in check any longer. Other changes are occurring as well. Jack is healing at an accelerated rate--much like Glaeken did when he was immortal. This can only mean that Glaeken\u0027s time is almost up and when he dies, Jack takes his place. \n Rasalom continues to plot against the Lady. Twice she has died and returned; a third time and she will be gone, leaving a clear path for the Otherness to infiltrate this reality. But Ernst Drexler, formerly Rasalom\u0027s go-to guy for logistical support, fears he will be left out in the cold when the Change comes. He forms an uneasy alliance with Jack, who is preparing to face their old enemy. \n Meanwhile, Dawn Pickering is searching for her supposedly dead baby. The trail leads her to a mansion in a remote Long Island coastal town, where she discovers a truth she could have never imagined. \n Now the stage is set for Jack\u0027s massive assault on Rasalom. Jack knows he\u0027s got just one shot. But it\u0027s not just a matter of taking out Rasalom: he also must safely retrieve Dawn\u0027s child and minimize collateral damage. So, he comes up with a foolproof plan. \n But fools are always with usâ€¦.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-dark-at-the-end.jpg","author":"F.
