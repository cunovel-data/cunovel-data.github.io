He holstered the Glock and went to retrieve it. The same number as before. He thumbed SEND.\n \"Weezy?\"\n \"I\u0027ve been calling Dawn but she doesn\u0027t answer.\"\n Jack glanced back toward the Volvo. \"Yeah ... well...\"\n \"What? What, Jack?\"\n He was on a cell, the signal going who knew where.\n \"Remember that movie with Bruce Willis?\"\n \"Die Hard? Listen, Jack, I don\u0027t want to play movie trivia. Dawn - \"\n \"Remember what Haley Joel Osment\u0027s character could see?\"\n \"Ohmigod! You mean - ?\"\n \"I\u0027m seeing three ... and a really ugly baby.\"\n \"Dawn? Is she - oh, God, no!\"\n \"Pull it together, okay? I - we need you to stay together. We\u0027ve got big trouble. What street are you on?\"\n \"Ju-just off twenty-seven.\"\n \"Any landmarky place nearby?\"\n \"I can see a farmer\u0027s market across the street but it\u0027s closed.\"\n \"I think I saw the place on the way in. Forget the car and get over there and wait. I\u0027ll pick you up ASAP.\"\n He cut the call before she could say anything else and looked around. Had to get these bodies out of sight. He wasn\u0027t worried about anyone hearing the shots in this wind and weather. What few people were within earshot were inside.\n He emptied Georges\u0027s pockets and found nothing but a cell phone and the Volvo keys. He grabbed him by the wrists and dragged him around to the far side of the car where he loaded him into the passenger seat. Heavy son of a bitch. Then he moved to the rear compartment to deal with Dawn.\n Poor kid. If she\u0027d just done what he\u0027d told her she\u0027d still be alive. He tried to imagine what had happened since he\u0027d left. She\u0027d been with Weezy, and Weezy had walked down to the car ... and then what?\n He leaned in and went to grab her shoulders to pull her farther into the car when the baby\u0027s deafening screech stopped him. He looked at the child - the Marty Allen hair and the scrunched-in features gave him a troll-doll look without any of the cuteness. Fury lit his beady little black eyes and Jack thought he was angry for taking his mother from him.\n \"Don\u0027t worry, little guy. I\u0027m not gonna - \"\n But then he saw the red smears on his face.\n As he watched, the kid dipped his fingers into the blood welled in Dawn\u0027s shoulder wound and then stuck them in his mouth, sucking greedily. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dark-at-the-end/page-49.html","bookId":2554,"book":{"id":2554,"title":"The Dark at the End","description":"Storyline: \n The Dark at the End (Repairman Jack #15) \n Bound by his promise to Glaeken, Jack has refrained from making any direct moves against Rasalom. But things have changed so there\u0027s nothing holding Jack in check any longer. Other changes are occurring as well. Jack is healing at an accelerated rate--much like Glaeken did when he was immortal. This can only mean that Glaeken\u0027s time is almost up and when he dies, Jack takes his place. \n Rasalom continues to plot against the Lady. Twice she has died and returned; a third time and she will be gone, leaving a clear path for the Otherness to infiltrate this reality. But Ernst Drexler, formerly Rasalom\u0027s go-to guy for logistical support, fears he will be left out in the cold when the Change comes. He forms an uneasy alliance with Jack, who is preparing to face their old enemy. \n Meanwhile, Dawn Pickering is searching for her supposedly dead baby. The trail leads her to a mansion in a remote Long Island coastal town, where she discovers a truth she could have never imagined. \n Now the stage is set for Jack\u0027s massive assault on Rasalom. Jack knows he\u0027s got just one shot. But it\u0027s not just a matter of taking out Rasalom: he also must safely retrieve Dawn\u0027s child and minimize collateral damage. So, he comes up with a foolproof plan. \n But fools are always with usâ€¦.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-dark-at-the-end.jpg","author":"F.
