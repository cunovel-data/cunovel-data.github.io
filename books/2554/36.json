{"id":111893,"no":36,"title":"Page 36","content":"\"Nothing?\" Dawn said, her voice rising in pitch and volume. \"We do nothing?\"\\n\\n Jack noticed a couple of people in the deli/sandwich shop glancing their way and made a calming gesture.\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s keep this between just the three of us, okay?\"\\n\\n \"Okay,\" she said at a lower volume. \"But my baby\u0027s in there. I can totally feel it.\"\\n\\n Jack watched her. Dawn looked more animated than he\u0027d ever seen her. After her call, he and Weezy had driven directly from Jersey to Long Island by way of the Verrazano and Brooklyn. They\u0027d stayed in touch much of the time, with only a few cell dead spots along the way. When Dawn had called to say Dr. Heinze was leaving the beach house, Jack had told her to follow him as far as the nearest town and find someplace like a coffee shop where she could wait for them. She\u0027d resisted at first, preferring to stay where she was, but had finally agreed.\\n\\n She\u0027d found a Citarella with a view of a windmill, and waited. The three of them occupied a rear table, with Jack facing the two women.\\n\\n Jack decided she looked more than animated. She looked wired. Not the state of someone who\u0027d be easy to convince that slow and steady was going to win this race. So he\u0027d have to let her convince herself.\\n\\n He said, \"I agree a hundred percent: Everything points to your baby being in that house. What do you think we should do?\"\\n\\n She shrugged as if the answer was too obvious. \"Go in and get him.\"\\n\\n \"Really? How many people are inside?\"\\n\\n From her spot beside Dawn, Weezy gave him an almost imperceptible nod of approval.\\n\\n \"Well, I know Georges is there, and I assume Mr. Osala and ... Gilda.\"\\n\\n Lots of poison in that last name. From what Jack had gathered, Osala\u0027s housekeeper had given Dawn a pretty hard time while she was a not-so-voluntary guest at the Fifth Avenue digs.\\n\\n \"Can\u0027t assume. You do a home invasion, you\u0027d damn well better know what you\u0027re getting into.\"\\n\\n She lowered her voice further. \"Well, you have a gun - I\u0027ve seen it. You could use it to make them give us the baby.\"\\n\\n \"They could have guns too, and things could get ugly, endangering us and your baby. But let\u0027s say they\u0027re unarmed. What if they refuse to give up the baby? Who do I shoot?\"\\n\\n She didn\u0027t hesitate. \"Gilda.\"\\n\\n \"Really? Shoot her dead or just wound her?\"\\n\\n She looked away. \"All right ... I guess not.\"\\n\\n \"Okay. But let\u0027s assume we do cow them and they hand over your baby. Where do you take him? They know where you live. Reprisals could follow. Not only that, you signed him away for adoption. Maybe Mr. Osala adopted him. You have no legal right to that baby, so they could send the police after you - and Weezy and me, as well - for kidnapping.\"\\n\\n She leaned back, looking defeated. \"Okay, okay, okay, but I can\u0027t believe there isn\u0027t something we can do.\"\\n\\n Weezy put an arm around her shoulders. \"We talked about this on the way here and we think we\u0027ve come up with a plan.\"\\n\\n He was glad she\u0027d sat next to Dawn; that way it didn\u0027t seem like the two adults against her. Jack had to keep reminding himself that she was only nineteen.\\n\\n \"Right,\" Jack said. \"A full frontal assault is a last resort. We need to determine exactly what we\u0027re dealing with and find a way to spirit your baby out of there without being seen. But before we try that, we need to set up a way for you to drop out of sight afterward. You\u0027ll be their prime suspect, but if they can\u0027t find you...\"\\n\\n Jack had no idea if he could pull this off. Really ... how do you hide a woman who has a baby with a tentacle growing out of each armpit? But he was going to try his damnedest.\\n\\n The only way he could see even a glimmer of hope of success was to take out Rasalom first. Do that and Georges and Gilda would lose their center, their purpose for staying with the baby. They might be glad to have someone take the child off their hands. But even if they weren\u0027t, grabbing the baby would be much easier with their Mr. Osala out of the picture. In the aftermath of his death, Jack could very likely swoop in and snatch the child from right under their noses.\\n\\n A plan began to form ...\\n\\n \"First thing we need is an observation post. You say you found a house that\u0027s a good vantage point?\"\\n\\n Dawn nodded. \"But I don\u0027t see how we can camp out there very long without someone noticing.\"\\n\\n Jack agreed. \"It has a garage?\"\\n\\n Another nod.\\n\\n \"Okay, we need to find out who owns it and - \"\\n\\n \"It has an oar over the door carved with \u0027The O\u0027Donnell\u0027s\u0027 - that\u0027s with an apostrophe s.\"\\n\\n \"Perfect. Time to learn all about the O\u0027Donnells.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dark-at-the-end/page-36.html","bookId":2554,"book":{"id":2554,"title":"The Dark at the End","description":"Storyline: The Dark at the End (Repairman Jack #15) \\n Bound by his promise to Glaeken, Jack has refrained from making any direct moves against Rasalom. But things have changed so there\u0027s nothing holding Jack in check any longer. Other changes are occurring as well. Jack is healing at an accelerated rate--much like Glaeken did when he was immortal. This can only mean that Glaeken\u0027s time is almost up and when he dies, Jack takes his place. \\n Rasalom continues to plot against the Lady. Twice she has died and returned; a third time and she will be gone, leaving a clear path for the Otherness to infiltrate this reality. But Ernst Drexler, formerly Rasalom\u0027s go-to guy for logistical support, fears he will be left out in the cold when the Change comes. He forms an uneasy alliance with Jack, who is preparing to face their old enemy. \\n Meanwhile, Dawn Pickering is searching for her supposedly dead baby. The trail leads her to a mansion in a remote Long Island coastal town, where she discovers a truth she could have never imagined. \\n Now the stage is set for Jack\u0027s massive assault on Rasalom. Jack knows he\u0027s got just one shot. But it\u0027s not just a matter of taking out Rasalom: he also must safely retrieve Dawn\u0027s child and minimize collateral damage. So, he comes up with a foolproof plan. \\n But fools are always with usâ€¦.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-dark-at-the-end.jpg","author":"F.
