If the meat wasn\u0027t stacked a full two inches, it was close. She looked around at the Lower East Side kosher deli Eddie had chosen - Moishe\u0027s on Second Avenue.\n \"How\u0027d you find this place?\" she said as he took a great-white bite. He had a sublet in the West Village, on the opposite side of the island.\n He chewed, swallowed, and sipped his Pepsi One.\n \"I wander the city most of the day. I mean, nothing else to do. I wandered in here for breakfast once and liked it.\"\n \"Youse folks okay here?\" said a high-pitched, cigarette-scorched voice with an aggressive Brooklyn accent.\n Weezy studied their waitress. She looked seventy and was built like Olive Oyl, but with a widow\u0027s hump and hair the color of a caution light. She seemed to have a pot of coffee grafted to her hand. Her name tag read Sally and her eye makeup was a wonder - a rainbow of blue hues applied like spackle.\n \"We\u0027re doing great,\" Weezy told her.\n \"You ain\u0027t touched your lox. Eat up. You never know when you\u0027re gonna get to eat again.\"\n As Sally wandered away in search of needy coffee cups, Weezy forked a piece of the salmon into her mouth. She wasn\u0027t particularly hungry. Not after seeing the Lady pierce herself with that sword.\n She nodded at Eddie who\u0027d just taken another huge bite. \"I don\u0027t think you\u0027ll have to eat again for a week.\"\n She noticed he\u0027d gained some weight since she\u0027d last seen him, though nothing like the Pugsley pudginess of his teen years. He was either letting his sandy hair grow longer or hadn\u0027t bothered to get it cut.\n \"Still working out?\"\n He shrugged. \"What\u0027s the point?\"\n \"Same point as before, I guess.\"\n \"For what?\" he said with some heat. \"I played by all the rules, Weez. I slimmed down, I got in shape, I worked hard, gave good value to my clients. And where did it get me? I had to abandon my business, I\u0027m afraid to go back to my house, I\u0027m subletting a roach-infested apartment. What went wrong?\"\n He\u0027d never been the type to feel sorry for himself. Maybe he was simply bored and frustrated. Either way, she would let him answer his own question.\n \"I think you know what went wrong.\"\n He sighed. \"Yeah. I joined the Order.\"\n Bull\u0027s-eye.\n They\u0027d discussed this before but she\u0027d never gotten a satisfactory answer.\n \"Why, Eddie?\"\n He shrugged. \"At the time it was, \u0027Why not?\u0027\" He raised a hand as she opened her mouth to reply. \"I know, I know. You always categorized it as one of the sinister forces in the world, one of the powers guiding the Secret History. But do you know how that sounds to the average person?\"\n \"Yeah. Crazy. Plus I did have my emotional problems, and I was diagnosed as manic-depressive, so I don\u0027t blame you one bit for dismissing what I said.\"\n \"It went beyond dismissing, you know. I got to the point where if you said something was black, I\u0027d assume it was white.\"\n She felt her throat tighten and her eyes fill. She blinked back tears.\n Eddie reached across and covered her hand. \"I\u0027m sorry, Weez. I didn\u0027t mean - \"\n \"No-no. It\u0027s okay. It wasn\u0027t just you. Mom and Dad were the same, and the kids in school. Every time I opened my mouth, eyes would roll. Finally I simply shut up. And now...\"\n \"Now you know you were right all along.\"\n \"And wish I weren\u0027t. I wish this were all the product of a mind careening out of control due to a screwed-up soup of neurotransmitters.\" She squeezed his hand. \"But Eddie, it\u0027s worse and more fantastic than I ever suspected.\"\n He frowned. \"More fantastic? How - ?\"\n \"Trust me?\" She squeezed his hand harder. \"I\u0027m saying it\u0027s black.\"\n He hesitated a heartbeat, then nodded. \"Then black it is. How black?\"\n Weezy closed her eyes and swallowed a sob of joy. Breakthrough. Her brother believed her ... finally believed her.\n \"Black-hole black.\"\n He shook his head. \"That book of yours - \"\n \"The Compendium of Srem.\"\n \"Yeah, that. There\u0027s nothing else in the world like it. That was a clue. And then the Order turning against me.\"\n \"They were never for you.\"\n \"Pretty obvious now, but they come on so benign, with such a seductive line. All the movers and shakers belong, and you can belong too - if you qualify.\"\n Weezy nodded. \"That\u0027s the grabber.\"\n \"Damn right it is. Appeals to the elitism in all of us. And it\u0027s not a marketing tool. You really do have to qualify. They put you through a rigorous vetting that lots of people don\u0027t pass.\"\n \"\u0027Many are called but few are chosen.\u0027\"\n \"You\u0027re quoting Jesus now?\"\n She shrugged. \"Whatever fits.\"\n \"Well, whatever their criteria, I was chosen. I look back and can\u0027t believe I let them brand me. That\u0027s how seductive it is. I spent six years in blissful ignorance until...\"\n \"Until I upset the apple cart.\"\n \"Turned on the light is more like it.\" He shook his head again. \"The Order was going to kill me.\"\n Right ... bad enough Eddie had learned something he wasn\u0027t supposed to know, he\u0027d mentioned it to the wrong person.\n He added, \"They would have if Jack hadn\u0027t interfered.\"\n Weezy had to smile. \"He\u0027s very good at interfering.\"\n Had it been only two weeks?\n \"You should have seen him, Weez. He beat the crap out of some guy named Szeto, then killed the guy who was driving me on my one-way trip. I mean, killed him like you or I would swat a fly.\"\n \"Well, the driver was trying to shoot you.\"\n \"I know that.\" He barked a brittle laugh. \"Don\u0027t get me wrong. I\u0027m not being the least bit critical. You\u0027d told me he\u0027d killed to protect you, but the image wouldn\u0027t stick. Then I saw him in action and he was ... the best way I can put it is coldly efficient. It was like someone else had taken over.\"\n Weezy nodded. \"He\u0027s able to do that. It\u0027s like he has a switch that can turn off every emotion and allow him to do what has to be done without hesitation.\"\n \"Well, I don\u0027t have that, but I do want to get involved.\"\n \"In what?\"\n \"In getting in the Order\u0027s way. They\u0027ve made a mess of my life, so I\u0027d like to return the favor.\"\n A part of Weezy immediately disliked this. The last time he\u0027d been proactive hadn\u0027t turned out so well.\n \"I don\u0027t know, Eddie...\"\n He leaned forward. \"Why not? You don\u0027t think I can be useful?\"\n \"You\u0027re maybe a little too emotionally involved.\"\n \"I\u0027m an actuary, Weez.\" He tapped a temple. \"A numbers guy. I can be dispassionate, especially about probabilities.\"\n \"But you have no idea of the scope of what we\u0027re up against. The Order is just the tip of the tip of an unimaginable iceberg. Meanwhile, humanity, existence as we know it, is sunning itself on the decks of the Titanic.\"\n He frowned. \"\u0027Humanity\u0027 ... \u0027existence as we know it\u0027?\"\n She sensed a reflexive doubt.\n \"Listen to me, Eddie: It\u0027s black.\"\n He hesitated, then nodded. \"Okay. Black. I accept that it\u0027s black because I trust you. But you never take things simply on faith, so don\u0027t expect me to. You need to educate me.\"\n She wished he could have been at the Lady\u0027s just a little while ago. Seeing that flap of skin melt into her back ... that would have been a combination education and big-time doubt eraser.\n She tapped her backpack. \"I\u0027ve got the Compendium. I\u0027m going to give you a crash course in the Conflict.\"\n \"The Conflict?\"\n \"With an uppercase C.\" She looked around. \"But not here. Eat up and we\u0027ll go to your apartment. We\u0027ll start with the First Age.\"\n He frowned. \"That little black pyramid you found as a kid ... you said it was from some First Age.\"\n \"It was, Eddie. It\u0027s all connected. Everything is connected.\"\n Wait till she told him about the Otherness and the Ally and the Lady - he\u0027d grown up knowing her as Mrs. Clevenger - and all the rest. The big question: Would he be able to handle the fact that he and the rest of humanity were property? \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dark-at-the-end/page-17.html","bookId":2554,"book":{"id":2554,"title":"The Dark at the End","description":"Storyline: \n The Dark at the End (Repairman Jack #15) \n Bound by his promise to Glaeken, Jack has refrained from making any direct moves against Rasalom. But things have changed so there\u0027s nothing holding Jack in check any longer. Other changes are occurring as well. Jack is healing at an accelerated rate--much like Glaeken did when he was immortal. This can only mean that Glaeken\u0027s time is almost up and when he dies, Jack takes his place. \n Rasalom continues to plot against the Lady. Twice she has died and returned; a third time and she will be gone, leaving a clear path for the Otherness to infiltrate this reality. But Ernst Drexler, formerly Rasalom\u0027s go-to guy for logistical support, fears he will be left out in the cold when the Change comes. He forms an uneasy alliance with Jack, who is preparing to face their old enemy. \n Meanwhile, Dawn Pickering is searching for her supposedly dead baby. The trail leads her to a mansion in a remote Long Island coastal town, where she discovers a truth she could have never imagined. \n Now the stage is set for Jack\u0027s massive assault on Rasalom. Jack knows he\u0027s got just one shot. But it\u0027s not just a matter of taking out Rasalom: he also must safely retrieve Dawn\u0027s child and minimize collateral damage. So, he comes up with a foolproof plan. \n But fools are always with usâ€¦.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-dark-at-the-end.jpg","author":"F.
