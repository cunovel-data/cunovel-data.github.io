Heart in his mouth - he\u0027d heard the expression, now he knew how it felt - he rushed forward and grabbed the doorknob. An instant of hesitation while his brain screamed Don\u0027t let it be! and then he pushed it open and -\n Blood. So much blood. Where could it possibly come - ?\n And then he saw the headless corpse sprawled on the floor. And beside it a head with Eddie\u0027s face, so pale, the eyes so wide.\n Jack\u0027s gorge rose. Eddie ... innocuous Eddie who\u0027d joined the Order just to network, who\u0027d spent his days crunching numbers, who\u0027d never harmed a soul in his life. Who would ever - ?\n But Jack knew who.\n He stood transfixed, staring until a low moan shook him free and he looked around. There, farther into the room, another pool of blood, another form on the floor, back to him, huddled in the fetal position. It moved ...\n Weezy?\n Oh, no!\n He stepped past Eddie, slipping and almost falling in the sticky blood of their merging pools, and dropped to his knees beside her.\n \"Weezy! Weezy!\"\n Her eyes fluttered open. \"Jack?\" Her voice was barely a whisper. \"That you? Can hardly see.\"\n He looked down to where her hands clutched her abdomen, saw a loop of intestine between her bloody fingers.\n \"I\u0027ll get help.\"\n He fumbled out his phone, punched in 9-1-1, then noticed \"No Service\" flashing on the display.\n \"Too late,\" she rasped. \"The Lady...\"\n Jack looked around and spotted a katana next to a nearby wooden chair lying on its side. He recognized the Gaijin Masamune and his heart sank as he realized what had gone down here.\n He spotted Glaeken sitting silent and immobile on the far side of the room, staring. Was he too - ?\n No. The old guy blinked. Jack knew what Rasalom had done to him. Jack had been frozen like that a couple of times himself.\n He turned back to Weezy.\n \"I\u0027ve got to get you out of here, find some help.\"\n \"No,\" she said. \"Too late. I love you, Jack.\"\n And then her eyes went blank and she stopped breathing.\n \"No! No!\"\n He rolled her onto her back and jammed his fingers against the side of her throat. No pulse. He parted her lips and blew into her mouth, then placed his palms one atop the other, and began thrusting against her chest.\n \"It\u0027s no use, I\u0027m afraid,\" Glaeken said.\n Jack glanced up and saw him approaching in a slow, stiff walk. Apparently he\u0027d been released.\n Jack felt a surge of blind anger. \"Don\u0027t tell me what\u0027s no use!\"\n \"She should have died some time ago, but he wouldn\u0027t let her. He kept her alive for you ... so you would see her die.\"\n \"No.\" He kept pumping on her chest. \"No!\"\n \"I loved her too, Jack.\" Glaeken\u0027s voice was thick with pain. \"But she has no blood left to pump.\"\n When the inescapable truth of that simple statement penetrated, Jack stopped. He slumped forward and rested his face against her silent chest. Pressure built in his own chest until it burst free in an explosive sob.\n She was gone. His Weezy was gone. Forever. The light of that brilliant, unique mind, snuffed out, never to shine again. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dark-at-the-end/page-95.html","bookId":2554,"book":{"id":2554,"title":"The Dark at the End","description":"Storyline: \n The Dark at the End (Repairman Jack #15) \n Bound by his promise to Glaeken, Jack has refrained from making any direct moves against Rasalom. But things have changed so there\u0027s nothing holding Jack in check any longer. Other changes are occurring as well. Jack is healing at an accelerated rate--much like Glaeken did when he was immortal. This can only mean that Glaeken\u0027s time is almost up and when he dies, Jack takes his place. \n Rasalom continues to plot against the Lady. Twice she has died and returned; a third time and she will be gone, leaving a clear path for the Otherness to infiltrate this reality. But Ernst Drexler, formerly Rasalom\u0027s go-to guy for logistical support, fears he will be left out in the cold when the Change comes. He forms an uneasy alliance with Jack, who is preparing to face their old enemy. \n Meanwhile, Dawn Pickering is searching for her supposedly dead baby. The trail leads her to a mansion in a remote Long Island coastal town, where she discovers a truth she could have never imagined. \n Now the stage is set for Jack\u0027s massive assault on Rasalom. Jack knows he\u0027s got just one shot. But it\u0027s not just a matter of taking out Rasalom: he also must safely retrieve Dawn\u0027s child and minimize collateral damage. So, he comes up with a foolproof plan. \n But fools are always with usâ€¦.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-dark-at-the-end.jpg","author":"F.
