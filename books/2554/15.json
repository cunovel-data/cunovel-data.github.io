{"id":111875,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"Dawn stared through her windshield at the McCready Foundation building from her quasi-legal parking space. Senator James McCready had died last year but his foundation lived on. Part of the building was rented office space - mostly to the private practices of the physicians associated with the foundation - but the rest was devoted to research. And that totally bothered Dawn. Dr. Heinze was a pediatric surgeon - it still bothered her that Mr. Osala had called in a surgeon - associated with a medical research facility. Were they doing research on her baby? Were his birth defects so unusual that he had to be hidden away and studied? She didn\u0027t care about his defects, she wanted him back. But where was he? She hadn\u0027t named him, and he certainly wouldn\u0027t be listed anywhere with her last name. Baby Boy Pickering. Totally unlikely. But he had to be somewhere. Banned from the building, she\u0027d had to set up watch out here. Not an easy thing in midtown Manhattan. She stepped out of the car - a used Volvo V70 wagon - and stretched her legs. Jack had helped her buy it. She glanced through the side window into the rear where the infant seat was securely strapped in. She\u0027d wanted a Volvo because she\u0027d heard they were safe, and if she was going to be driving her baby around, she wanted a safe car. She\u0027d parked where she could see not only the front entrance to the office section of the building but the ramps in and out of the attached garage as well. She was suddenly on alert as a silver Lexus pulled out of the garage. Dr. Heinze drove a silver Lexus - And yes, that was him behind the wheel. She jumped in and started the car. She\u0027d never before been able to follow him after he left his office. Now she\u0027d know exactly what he was up to. And, eventually, where he lived.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dark-at-the-end/page-15.html","bookId":2554,"book":{"id":2554,"title":"The Dark at the End","description":"Storyline: The Dark at the End (Repairman Jack #15) Bound by his promise to Glaeken, Jack has refrained from making any direct moves against Rasalom. But things have changed so there\u0027s nothing holding Jack in check any longer. Other changes are occurring as well. Jack is healing at an accelerated rate--much like Glaeken did when he was immortal. This can only mean that Glaeken\u0027s time is almost up and when he dies, Jack takes his place. Rasalom continues to plot against the Lady. Twice she has died and returned; a third time and she will be gone, leaving a clear path for the Otherness to infiltrate this reality. But Ernst Drexler, formerly Rasalom\u0027s go-to guy for logistical support, fears he will be left out in the cold when the Change comes. He forms an uneasy alliance with Jack, who is preparing to face their old enemy. Meanwhile, Dawn Pickering is searching for her supposedly dead baby. The trail leads her to a mansion in a remote Long Island coastal town, where she discovers a truth she could have never imagined. Now the stage is set for Jack\u0027s massive assault on Rasalom. Jack knows he\u0027s got just one shot. But it\u0027s not just a matter of taking out Rasalom: he also must safely retrieve Dawn\u0027s child and minimize collateral damage. So, he comes up with a foolproof plan. But fools are always with usâ€¦.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-dark-at-the-end.jpg","author":"F.
