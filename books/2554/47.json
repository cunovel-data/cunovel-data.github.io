No answer from either Weezy or Dawn. Not good. Not good at all. All they had to do was sit tight in that house and watch from the window. What was so hard about that? Had the goddamn O\u0027Donnells come back from Florida and found their home invaded? What? What?\\n\\n His phone rang. He grabbed it. The display showed a number he didn\u0027t recognize. He thumbed SEND. He\u0027d take a call from anyone right now.\\n\\n \"Yeah.\"\\n\\n \"Jack, it\u0027s me.\" Weezy\u0027s voice. \"Where are you?\"\\n\\n \"Just about to the Nuckateague turnoff. Where are you?\"\\n\\n \"In a garage in Amagansett.\"\\n\\n \"What? How the hell - ?\"\\n\\n \"Long story. The Jeep got towed. I can\u0027t get it back because it\u0027s rented under your name. A complete mess.\"\\n\\n Well, rented under his Tyleski name. He\u0027d been ready to deep-six that identity anyway. No arguing about the mess, though. He looked ahead for a place to make a U-turn.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll come get you and - \"\\n\\n \"No. Check the house first. I can\u0027t get hold of Dawn.\"\\n\\n \"Neither can I.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m worried.\"\\n\\n \"Makes two of us. I hope she didn\u0027t do anything stupid. You were supposed to keep an eye on her.\"\\n\\n \"I know, I know. But I saw the lights of the tow truck. I figured I\u0027d be right back - \"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m turning into Nuckateague. Stay by that phone.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll keep trying Dawn.\"\\n\\n He hit the END button and made the turn.\\n\\n Okay, how to play this? His initial plan had been to find another empty garage farther down the street to hide the Crown Vic and its armamentarium. To reach that house, whichever one it was, required him to drive by the O\u0027Donnell place.\\n\\n So that was what he\u0027d do ... and hope everything was as he\u0027d left it. He shook his head as foreboding thickened around him like a fog.\\n\\n Fat chance.\\n\\n This was why he worked alone. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dark-at-the-end/page-47.html","bookId":2554,"book":{"id":2554,"title":"The Dark at the End","description":"Storyline: The Dark at the End (Repairman Jack #15) \\n Bound by his promise to Glaeken, Jack has refrained from making any direct moves against Rasalom. But things have changed so there\u0027s nothing holding Jack in check any longer. Other changes are occurring as well. Jack is healing at an accelerated rate--much like Glaeken did when he was immortal. This can only mean that Glaeken\u0027s time is almost up and when he dies, Jack takes his place. \\n Rasalom continues to plot against the Lady. Twice she has died and returned; a third time and she will be gone, leaving a clear path for the Otherness to infiltrate this reality. But Ernst Drexler, formerly Rasalom\u0027s go-to guy for logistical support, fears he will be left out in the cold when the Change comes. He forms an uneasy alliance with Jack, who is preparing to face their old enemy. \\n Meanwhile, Dawn Pickering is searching for her supposedly dead baby. The trail leads her to a mansion in a remote Long Island coastal town, where she discovers a truth she could have never imagined. \\n Now the stage is set for Jack\u0027s massive assault on Rasalom. Jack knows he\u0027s got just one shot. But it\u0027s not just a matter of taking out Rasalom: he also must safely retrieve Dawn\u0027s child and minimize collateral damage. So, he comes up with a foolproof plan. \\n But fools are always with usâ€¦.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-dark-at-the-end.jpg","author":"F.
