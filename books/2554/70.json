{"id":111926,"no":70,"title":"Page 70","content":"\"I should move in here,\" Weezy said as she and Eddie entered the Lady\u0027s apartment. She placed the backpack with the Compendium on the table. The Lady smiled from her usual seat. \"If you have no place to stay, you are always welcome here. You know that. I will not forget how you sat at my side that night.\" Neither would Weezy. She\u0027d been sure then that she was seeing the last of the Lady. She glanced over at Dawn\u0027s baby in his playpen. He was chewing on a bone, just like yesterday. \"Where do you get the soup bones?\" \"A local butcher delivers them.\" \"It looks raw,\" Eddie said, making a face. \"He prefers them that way. He wears them down to the marrow. He likes the blood there.\" Weezy remembered the blood she\u0027d washed off his face that first day. She\u0027d assumed it was from his teeth. Now she wondered ... She shook it off. It didn\u0027t bear thinking about. \"Do you know why Jack asked us here?\" The Lady shook her head. \"He did not tell me.\" \"Nor me,\" Glaeken said as he entered and eased into his seat at the head of the table. \"But he seemed ... enthused.\" Weezy could think of only one thing Jack had been enthused about lately. \"Then it must have something to do with killing Rasalom.\" As if on cue, Jack entered. \"It does.\" He dropped his bomber jacket onto the remaining seat opposite Weezy but remained standing. \"I think I\u0027ve found a solution to the Other Naming Ceremony problem.\" He seemed a different person from the surly grouch of yesterday\u0027s gathering. He appeared unable to sit still. He was psyched about something. \"Which problem?\" Weezy said. \"Not knowing the name, or no one to perform the ceremony?\" \"The latter.\" Weezy glanced at the Lady, then back to Jack. \"You\u0027ve found someone else who can read the small folks\u0027 writing?\" \"No. But I think I can convince the Lady to perform it on me.\" \"I will not,\" she said with rock-solid finality. \"Give me a chance here. I\u0027ve been up half the night thinking about this.\" That would be Jack. Give him a problem to solve and he was like Dawn\u0027s baby with a bone: He\u0027d gnaw it down to the marrow. He turned to Weezy. \"Could you read us that paragraph about the ceremony?\" \"I don\u0027t need to read it.\" \"Okay. Would you recite it, please?\" Weezy pictured the page and began to read from it. \"\u0027No two humans may have the same Other Name. The First-named shall be powerless as long as the Second-named lives. The First-named shall hear the Name within the Second and thus be able to resolve the duplication.\u0027\" \"Thanks,\" Jack said. \"Now, the second half is the part that\u0027s causing the problem. The Lady here thinks it\u0027s a death sentence. I disagree.\" The Lady said, \"The One \u0027shall hear the Name\u0027 within you. That means, even if you never speak the Other Name you have been given, you will know it ... it will be in your mind. He will hear it just as he hears \u0027Rasalom\u0027 whenever it is spoken. He will follow that name to you, wait until you are vulnerable, and slay you.\" Jack held up a finger. \"Ah, but what if I don\u0027t know the Other Name I\u0027m given?\" \"How can you not?\" Weezy said. \"You\u0027ll have to go through the ceremony.\" He looked at the Lady. \"Does the ceremony require me to say the name?\" She shook her head. \"It does not.\" \"Well, then,\" he said, \"what if I\u0027m unconscious during the ceremony? Then I won\u0027t be aware of a word being said.\" Weezy stared at him. She noticed Glaeken, the Lady, and Eddie doing the same. She voiced what she knew they were all thinking. \"Are you out of your mind?\" \"Not at all.\" He began wandering around the table. \"We can hire an anesthetist to put me under during the ceremony. I called Doc Hargus this morning and he said he could fix me up with one.\" Weezy couldn\u0027t help it. \"That\u0027s the craziest thing I\u0027ve ever heard.\" Jack glared at her. \"Can I speak to you a minute? Alone? Outside?\" She hesitated, taken aback by his expression and the strange request. What couldn\u0027t they say in front of Eddie, Glaeken, and the Lady? But how could she refuse? \"Sure.\" She followed him into the hall where he shut the door behind them and lowered his voice. \"Why are you so negative about this?\" \"Because it\u0027s crazy, Jack.\" \"What\u0027s crazy about it? Look at the situation: Rasalom is down but not out. In fact, he\u0027s coming back and we don\u0027t know how to find him to finish the job. As soon as he\u0027s well enough, he\u0027s going to want payback. How long do you think it\u0027s going to take him to figure out I was behind the Nuckateague attack, if he hasn\u0027t already? That means he\u0027ll be coming after me anyway. So why not render him \u0027powerless\u0027 before he does? That will at least level the playing field.\" \"But we don\u0027t know what \u0027powerless\u0027 means. It could simply mean unable to bring about the Change. All his other advantages could very well remain intact.\" \"But at least he\u0027ll no longer be the One. There\u0027ll be two with his Other Name, and that\u0027s got to hamper him.\" \"I don\u0027t think that\u0027s going to change the Lady\u0027s mind.\" \"It might. But I\u0027ll never convince her with you constantly sniping at me.\" \"I\u0027m sorry, Jack, but I\u0027ve got to say what I feel, and I think it\u0027s a bad idea. What if you\u0027re wrong?\" \"Even if I\u0027m wrong, can we afford not to take the chance? If Rasalom finds a way to extinguish the Lady, this whole opportunity goes with her. The option of the Other Name is entirely off the table because there\u0027ll be no one to perform the ceremony.\" Was this why he\u0027d wanted to talk in private - didn\u0027t want to discuss the Lady\u0027s demise in front of her? \"But he\u0027s got nothing left to throw at her. If he did, he would have used it instead of trying that ambush.\" Jack\u0027s mouth twisted. \"That was just to test if she was still immune to Earthly harm.\" \"Which means if he had another option, he would have used it.\" \"I think Dawn\u0027s child might have been part of his plan.\" Weezy\u0027s heart clenched. She\u0027d had the same feeling but hadn\u0027t wanted to voice it. \"How could that baby be used against the Lady?\" He shook his head. \"Wish I knew.\" \"Let\u0027s go back inside and ask the Lady herself.\" As Weezy started toward the door, Jack gripped her arm. \"You\u0027ll back me on the anesthesia?\" She didn\u0027t want any walls between Jack and her, but she couldn\u0027t get behind his plan. \"I think it\u0027s a terrible risk but I\u0027m willing to compromise: I\u0027ll shut up and let you see if you can change her mind.\" He gave a curt nod. \"Fair enough.\" Eddie gave her a what\u0027s-going-on? look when they returned. Glaeken said, \"Have you settled your disagreements?\" \"We ironed out a few things,\" Weezy said, \"but came up with an interesting question.\" She turned to the Lady and pointed to the baby. \"Can you think of any way that child can be used against you?\" The Lady sat still a moment, then shook her head. \"Not a one. Why do you ask?\" Jack stepped forward. \"We\u0027re not sure. But consider what we know: We know the baby is brimming with the Otherness. And we know that Rasalom protected Dawn throughout her pregnancy, then took the baby into hiding right after he was born. He\u0027s not the paternal sort and he\u0027s got a one-track mind that\u0027s fixed on the Change. He can\u0027t effect the Change with you around, so that means...?\" Jack gave Weezy an expectant look, so she turned to the Lady and answered the implied question. \"He must think he can use the baby against you.\" Glaeken said, \"Your conclusion has a certain circumstantial logic to it, but in reality...\" He shrugged. \"The baby has a deep, strong Taint, but is not as full of the Otherness as a full-blown q\u0027qr. The Lady was around when the world was full of q\u0027qrs and they never posed a threat to her. Their blood may be from the Otherness, but they are creatures of the Earth and powerless against her. Maybe Rasalom thought he might eventually find a use for the baby against the Lady, but that is moot now.\" The Lady nodded. \"For now I have him.\" Jack and Weezy stared at each other. She was sure Jack\u0027s suddenly troubled expression matched hers. She echoed Gia\u0027s question from the other night: \"Do you think this could have been his plan all along?\" After a long pause, Jack shook his head. \"I can\u0027t see how getting caught in an exploding house and being set on fire and almost drowning and having a boat blown out from under you by a Stinger were part of his plan.\" Eddie cleared his throat. \"Speaking from an actuarial perspective, none of that eliminates the possibility that his original plan was to return the baby to Dawn.\" \"But Dawn is dead,\" Jack said. \"True. But isn\u0027t it true that this guy, this One, placed Dawn across the hall from Weezy? Which would place the baby, when returned to Dawn, in proximity to Weezy and, by extension, to the Lady.\" He pointed to the Lady, then to the baby. \"If so, mission accomplished.\" Weezy gave Jack a look. \"Told you he\u0027d bring a new perspective.\" Jack glanced at the baby, then the Lady. \"Jeez.\" Then at Eddie. \"High or low probability?\" Eddie gave an uncomfortable shrug. \"Wish I could say. I don\u0027t have enough data.\" Weezy\u0027s mind whirled with all the possibilities and permutations of the situation. \"I have to tell you, this is way confusing.\" Glaeken said, \"It is indeed. We don\u0027t know what the One\u0027s plans were for the baby, but Eddie, the Lady, and I came up with one of our own while you two were in conference.\" Jack said, \"What about my idea?\" \"It has merit.\" He dropped into his chair. \"Well, that\u0027s a start.\" \"But it has serious flaws as well.\" \"Like?\" Glaeken leaned forward. \"What if the anesthesia is just a tiny bit too light and you hear the name during the ceremony? Or what if your brain registers it and stores it even if your consciousness doesn\u0027t? What if you\u0027re wrong and you don\u0027t have to know the Other Name to allow Rasalom to \u0027hear\u0027 it within you? What if simply knowing you\u0027ve been given his Other Name is enough?\" \"A lot of what-ifs,\" Jack said. \"Then here\u0027s the ultimate what-if: If just one of those what-ifs is true, he will \u0027hear\u0027 the name within you. That means he will know where you are every minute of every day. You will never be able to surprise him again. But he will be able to surprise you. Knowing your whereabouts, he can bide his time, make his plans, and then strike when the time is right - for him.\" Weezy could see that struck a nerve with Jack. The idea of someone knowing his whereabouts at all times was bad enough, but when that someone was Rasalom ... She was tempted to speak, but bit it back. She\u0027d promised ... \"You\u0027re our spear, Jack,\" Glaeken said. \"I\u0027d hate to think of you fitted with a locator.\" Exactly. Jack looked at the Lady. \"So you won\u0027t do the naming ceremony.\" \"Not on you.\" \"Then who?\" Jack said. \"Glaeken?\" \"That was a thought,\" the old man said. \"I\u0027ve got the least to lose, and if not for Magda, I wouldn\u0027t hesitate. But, even in her present state - or perhaps because of her present state - I can\u0027t desert my wife.\" \"Well, forget about Weezy,\" Jack said. \"No way that\u0027s happening.\" \"No, not Weezy,\" Glaeken said. \"Eddie volunteered - \" \"No!\" Weezy cried, her heart constricting. He said, \"I\u0027ve lost my home, my business, and I\u0027ve got no strings. I\u0027m perfect, but - \" \"But we came up with a better candidate,\" Glaeken said. \"There is one more in the room you might consider.\" Weezy had a sudden bad feeling about what was coming next. She slowly turned and looked at the baby, gnawing contentedly on its bone. \"Oh, no. You can\u0027t be serious.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dark-at-the-end/page-70.html","bookId":2554,"book":{"id":2554,"title":"The Dark at the End","description":"Storyline: The Dark at the End (Repairman Jack #15) Bound by his promise to Glaeken, Jack has refrained from making any direct moves against Rasalom. But things have changed so there\u0027s nothing holding Jack in check any longer. Other changes are occurring as well. Jack is healing at an accelerated rate--much like Glaeken did when he was immortal. This can only mean that Glaeken\u0027s time is almost up and when he dies, Jack takes his place. Rasalom continues to plot against the Lady. Twice she has died and returned; a third time and she will be gone, leaving a clear path for the Otherness to infiltrate this reality. But Ernst Drexler, formerly Rasalom\u0027s go-to guy for logistical support, fears he will be left out in the cold when the Change comes. He forms an uneasy alliance with Jack, who is preparing to face their old enemy. Meanwhile, Dawn Pickering is searching for her supposedly dead baby. The trail leads her to a mansion in a remote Long Island coastal town, where she discovers a truth she could have never imagined. Now the stage is set for Jack\u0027s massive assault on Rasalom. Jack knows he\u0027s got just one shot. But it\u0027s not just a matter of taking out Rasalom: he also must safely retrieve Dawn\u0027s child and minimize collateral damage.
