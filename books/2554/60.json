And once again he reassembled his scattered thoughts into a semi-coherent assessment of his situation.\\n\\n He had washed up on an unknown shore. He lay upon snow-covered sand. A light shone somewhere ahead. He had been trying to reach it, crawling toward it. But every time he progressed a few feet, he passed out. And each attempt yielded less progress and briefer consciousness. But now something new.\\n\\n Somewhere a dog barked.\\n\\n The light went out ...\\n\\n ... and came back on again. And something else. A vocal rumble nearby.\\n\\n A dog, sniffing, panting, and growling. Would it attack? He could not defend himself against a sick kitten, let along a hungry dog. Never, not even during his darkest days trapped in the depths of the keep, had he felt this helpless.\\n\\n And then a voice ... one of the cattle ... a cow ... far away ... or perhaps it only seemed far away.\\n\\n \"Rocky? Rocky, come back here this instant!\"\\n\\n He clung to the sound like a sailor to flotsam. He tried to speak but had no voice. He managed to raise his remaining hand, and that set the dog to barking again.\\n\\n \"What have you got out there, you dumb mutt?\" the cow said. He sensed age in the voice. \"Whatever it is, leave it alone and come inside before you catch your death.\"\\n\\n No! Do not go in! Stay!\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t make me come out there!\"\\n\\n Yes! Come out! I beg you, come out! I will give you anything! I will seat you at my right hand after the Change if you will only bring me into your house!\\n\\n He moved his hand again, precipitating a new round of near hysterical barking.\\n\\n \"I declare, you are the dumbest creature on Earth!\" The voice ... growing louder. \"And I\u0027m even dumber for coming out in this to get you. I should leave you out here, but you\u0027re so dumb you\u0027d forget how to find the door! You\u0027ll probably - Mother of God! Is that - ?\"\\n\\n He felt something nudge him. A toe? He raised his hand as he had before.\\n\\n \"Dear God, he\u0027s alive!\"\\n\\n He felt something tighten on his left arm. He assumed it was the cow\u0027s hands but he was too numb to feel anything beyond deep pressure.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re going to have to help me, mister,\" she said. \"I\u0027m assuming you don\u0027t know I\u0027m on in years and don\u0027t see so well. You\u0027re dead weight and I can\u0027t move you on my own.\"\\n\\n He pushed against the ground with his right hand while she tugged on his left arm. Suddenly she released him and he dropped again.\\n\\n \"Dear God! Your hand! Did you lose your hand?\"\\n\\n He wanted to scream, Isn\u0027t that obvious, you old idiot?\\n\\n Fortunately for him, he still had no voice. He could only grunt.\\n\\n She grabbed him again, pulling on his truncated left arm while he dug his right hand into the semi-frozen snow and pushed toward the light. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dark-at-the-end/page-60.html","bookId":2554,"book":{"id":2554,"title":"The Dark at the End","description":"Storyline: The Dark at the End (Repairman Jack #15) \\n Bound by his promise to Glaeken, Jack has refrained from making any direct moves against Rasalom. But things have changed so there\u0027s nothing holding Jack in check any longer. Other changes are occurring as well. Jack is healing at an accelerated rate--much like Glaeken did when he was immortal. This can only mean that Glaeken\u0027s time is almost up and when he dies, Jack takes his place. \\n Rasalom continues to plot against the Lady. Twice she has died and returned; a third time and she will be gone, leaving a clear path for the Otherness to infiltrate this reality. But Ernst Drexler, formerly Rasalom\u0027s go-to guy for logistical support, fears he will be left out in the cold when the Change comes. He forms an uneasy alliance with Jack, who is preparing to face their old enemy. \\n Meanwhile, Dawn Pickering is searching for her supposedly dead baby. The trail leads her to a mansion in a remote Long Island coastal town, where she discovers a truth she could have never imagined. \\n Now the stage is set for Jack\u0027s massive assault on Rasalom. Jack knows he\u0027s got just one shot. But it\u0027s not just a matter of taking out Rasalom: he also must safely retrieve Dawn\u0027s child and minimize collateral damage. So, he comes up with a foolproof plan. \\n But fools are always with usâ€¦.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-dark-at-the-end.jpg","author":"F.
