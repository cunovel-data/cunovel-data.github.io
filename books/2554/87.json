{"id":111941,"no":87,"title":"Page 87","content":"Glaeken admitted them to the Lady\u0027s apartment. Weezy had called ahead from the road to tell him they would be there soon. The first thing upon entering, she went straight to the Lady and handed her the paper.\\n\\n \"What do you think? Is it a name?\"\\n\\n As the Lady took it, Weezy moved to her side and together they stared at the weird glyphs.\\n\\n After a moment the Lady nodded. \"It has been so long since I have seen this form of writing. It has been dead for ages. But, yes, it is a name.\" She then made a sound like two grunts of different pitch connected by a click.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s a name?\" Eddie said. He sounded as if he was suppressing a laugh.\\n\\n The Lady looked up at him. \"I believe that is what I said.\"\\n\\n Weezy realized that Eddie wasn\u0027t used to the Lady\u0027s literal nature, so she jumped in.\\n\\n \"But is it the name - Rasalom\u0027s Other Name?\"\\n\\n The Lady shrugged. \"Who is to say? I have no way of telling.\"\\n\\n \"But it came from the broken sigil,\" Eddie said. \"It was written on the only remaining section of the border.\"\\n\\n \"And the sigil is made of tenathic,\" Weezy added.\\n\\n Glaeken said, \"If that\u0027s true, then it can only be from the First Age - the secret of forging it was lost in the Cataclysm. We have no choice but to proceed on the assumption this is his Other Name.\"\\n\\n \"But what if it\u0027s not?\" Weezy said.\\n\\n \"We will never be sure until we try.\"\\n\\n Weezy finally looked directly at the playpen. Since entering the apartment, she\u0027d kept it in her peripheral vision. Now she had to confront the reality of burdening that baby with Rasalom\u0027s Other Name.\\n\\n As ever, he sat in his space and gnawed a soup bone. He seemed perfectly content, oblivious to the role he was about to play in a cosmic drama. If Glaeken was right, his limited intelligence would allow him to remain oblivious. And that in turn would protect him.\\n\\n She watched him and thought about how they were all pawns being moved around a cosmic game board. And now the pawns in this room were about to move him, bringing him into the game.\\n\\n But hadn\u0027t he always been in play? Wasn\u0027t that what Jonah Stevens had in mind when he started designing his own strategy using his bloodline - a strategy aimed at producing a child that would supplant the One?\\n\\n So, in a way, Jonah was going to get his wish: His grandchild was going to stop the One, though not in the way he\u0027d intended.\\n\\n \"Even if it\u0027s not the One\u0027s Other Name,\" Eddie said, \"we haven\u0027t lost anything, have we?\"\\n\\n Weezy looked from Glaeken to the Lady. \"Have we?\"\\n\\n \"The Other Naming Ceremony can be performed only once on the child. Once given an Other Name, it cannot be undone.\"\\n\\n Weezy looked back to the baby. \"So, he could wind up with an Other Name that has no power. Then what?\"\\n\\n Glaeken shrugged. \"It is the only name we have. Unless you know of some other inscribed tenathic sigil somewhere, we must accept it as the only name we will ever have.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027ve got to go with it, Weez,\" Eddie said. \"And the sooner the better, if you ask me.\"\\n\\n She wasn\u0027t asking him. She shook her head. \"I want to wait for Jack.\"\\n\\n Eddie scowled. \"He could be cooling his heels in a jail cell for all we know.\"\\n\\n \"Wait,\" Glaeken said. \"Where is Jack? Why isn\u0027t he here?\"\\n\\n How did she explain? She wasn\u0027t sure herself.\\n\\n \"Something about the situation bothers him. He thinks it\u0027s too easy, too pat.\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t argue with him on that. But if the sigil is, as you say, made of tenathic, then it must be genuine.\"\\n\\n \"I agree, but he wanted another look at it.\"\\n\\n \"We were caught trespassing in the Lodge,\" Eddie said. \"We were lucky we got away. Jack might not be so lucky a second time.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t know Jack,\" she snapped, fully intending the double meaning.\\n\\n Eddie sighed. \"I do. Or at least I\u0027ve been getting to know him. But nobody\u0027s perfect. I think it was risky going back.\"\\n\\n \"And don\u0027t you think the stakes merit some risk? We\u0027ll wait until we hear from Jack.\"\\n\\n She didn\u0027t have the authority to say that, but she guessed enough of her determination shone through. No one argued. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dark-at-the-end/page-87.html","bookId":2554,"book":{"id":2554,"title":"The Dark at the End","description":"Storyline: The Dark at the End (Repairman Jack #15) \\n Bound by his promise to Glaeken, Jack has refrained from making any direct moves against Rasalom. But things have changed so there\u0027s nothing holding Jack in check any longer. Other changes are occurring as well. Jack is healing at an accelerated rate--much like Glaeken did when he was immortal. This can only mean that Glaeken\u0027s time is almost up and when he dies, Jack takes his place. \\n Rasalom continues to plot against the Lady. Twice she has died and returned; a third time and she will be gone, leaving a clear path for the Otherness to infiltrate this reality. But Ernst Drexler, formerly Rasalom\u0027s go-to guy for logistical support, fears he will be left out in the cold when the Change comes. He forms an uneasy alliance with Jack, who is preparing to face their old enemy. \\n Meanwhile, Dawn Pickering is searching for her supposedly dead baby. The trail leads her to a mansion in a remote Long Island coastal town, where she discovers a truth she could have never imagined. \\n Now the stage is set for Jack\u0027s massive assault on Rasalom. Jack knows he\u0027s got just one shot. But it\u0027s not just a matter of taking out Rasalom: he also must safely retrieve Dawn\u0027s child and minimize collateral damage. So, he comes up with a foolproof plan. \\n But fools are always with usâ€¦.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-dark-at-the-end.jpg","author":"F.
