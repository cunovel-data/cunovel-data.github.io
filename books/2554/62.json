At least he assumed it was warm. He\u0027d lost all feeling.\n \"Lord, you\u0027re all but frozen. I hope you don\u0027t mind, but I\u0027m going to have to cut you out of those wet clothes. There\u0027s not much left to them anyway. Mostly charred rags.\"\n During the next few minutes he felt himself rolled left and right as he assumed his tattered clothing was being ripped or cut away.\n \"Don\u0027t you worry about me staring at your bum or your privates. I got what they call wet AMD - macular degeneration. You\u0027re mostly a blur to me.\"\n He wasn\u0027t worried about that. Survival was his concern.\n She left him, then returned. He felt a blanket fall over him.\n \"You\u0027re gonna have to stay there on the rug for now, I\u0027m afraid. No way we\u0027re gonna get you up on the couch. But this here\u0027s an electric blanket. It\u0027ll warm up shortly and start raising your temperature.\"\n Good. Warmth. He\u0027d thought he\u0027d never be warm again.\n \"What happened to you? I heard an explosion and saw something light up out on the water. That you? Your boat blow up?\"\n Exactly what had happened, but he could not imagine how. He\u0027d been free. The burning house had been a glow fading in his wake when something shot out of the darkness and struck the rear of the boat, hurling him through the air and into the water. He remembered nothing until he washed up on this shore.\n \"Well, whatever happened, you need a doctor and a hospital, especially for that hand. From what I can see it\u0027s all charred, and I guess that\u0027s good because it\u0027s not bleeding, but that stump\u0027s gonna need specialist care.\"\n No! He was too weak. He\u0027d be vulnerable in a hospital. Defenseless.\n \"But no way you\u0027re gonna get to one tonight. The phone\u0027s not working worth a damn, and even if it was, I don\u0027t see anyone coming out in this storm. So we\u0027re gonna have to ride it out together tonight and see what the morning brings. I\u0027ll get the boat out here as soon as it can make the trip.\"\n He could not allow her to call for help, but how could he stop her? He fought to stay conscious, but it slipped away ...\n ... until he felt himself rolled onto his side.\n \"Here,\" she was saying.\n His head was propped on pillows or cushions. He knew only that they were soft. He felt a straw pressed between his swollen lips.\n \"Drink some of that.\"\n He drew on the straw. Hot salty liquid filled his mouth. He swallowed and greedily sucked more.\n \"I heated you up a can of chicken broth. Drink as much as you can. With the electric blanket cooking you on the outside and this working from the inside, we\u0027ll have you warmed up yet.\"\n This cow ... if he survived this, she would be rewarded.\n He swallowed more and took a breath. He tried his voice. He had to know.\n \"Where...?\" was all he could manage. His voice sounded like sandpaper on concrete. He must have inhaled smoke, perhaps even a little flame.\n \"Oh, so you can speak. Well, your voice don\u0027t sound too good. Maybe you better save it. As for where you are - little place called Sadie\u0027s Island, in the middle of Gardiner\u0027s Bay. And me? I\u0027m Sadie. Sadie Swick. I own this little hunk of rock and I\u0027m its sole resident. And how about you? What are you called?\"\n What name to use? He\u0027d had so many of them. He chose an old one at random.\n \"Roma,\" he croaked.\n \"Like the quarterback? Any relation?\"\n So many people had asked him those questions when he\u0027d started using the name. He had no idea what they were talking about at first, but he\u0027d soon learned.\n \"Rome-AH,\" he said.\n \"Like the city then. Got a first name?\"\n \"Sal.\"\n \"A real Italian, ay? You don\u0027t look Italian, but then I\u0027ve known a bunch of Italians who don\u0027t. Welcome to Sadie\u0027s Island, Sal. Wish it could have been under better circumstances but...\"\n She talked on but her voice faded with his consciousness. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dark-at-the-end/page-62.html","bookId":2554,"book":{"id":2554,"title":"The Dark at the End","description":"Storyline: \n The Dark at the End (Repairman Jack #15) \n Bound by his promise to Glaeken, Jack has refrained from making any direct moves against Rasalom. But things have changed so there\u0027s nothing holding Jack in check any longer. Other changes are occurring as well. Jack is healing at an accelerated rate--much like Glaeken did when he was immortal. This can only mean that Glaeken\u0027s time is almost up and when he dies, Jack takes his place. \n Rasalom continues to plot against the Lady. Twice she has died and returned; a third time and she will be gone, leaving a clear path for the Otherness to infiltrate this reality. But Ernst Drexler, formerly Rasalom\u0027s go-to guy for logistical support, fears he will be left out in the cold when the Change comes. He forms an uneasy alliance with Jack, who is preparing to face their old enemy. \n Meanwhile, Dawn Pickering is searching for her supposedly dead baby. The trail leads her to a mansion in a remote Long Island coastal town, where she discovers a truth she could have never imagined. \n Now the stage is set for Jack\u0027s massive assault on Rasalom. Jack knows he\u0027s got just one shot. But it\u0027s not just a matter of taking out Rasalom: he also must safely retrieve Dawn\u0027s child and minimize collateral damage. So, he comes up with a foolproof plan. \n But fools are always with usâ€¦.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-dark-at-the-end.jpg","author":"F.
