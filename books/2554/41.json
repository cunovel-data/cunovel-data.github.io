{"id":111898,"no":41,"title":"Page 41","content":"Weezy guessed this was what cops called a stakeout. How did they stand it? Boredom had her ready to scream.\n She was sick of watching that place on the far side of Dune Drive but they had to track anyone coming or going - especially Rasalom or the baby. Rasalom - had to remember to call him Osala when Dawn was around - wasn\u0027t due in till tonight, and she hardly expected to see the driver or the housekeeper taking the baby for a walk in a stroller. Not in this wind and cold.\n Still ...\n She trained Jack\u0027s Leica on the place anyway. She didn\u0027t know what these binoculars cost, but knew they were pricey. Worth it, though. She felt she knew every cedar shake on the house\u0027s siding, every shingle on its hipped roof. Even found a few that needed replacing.\n After checking all the windows, she aimed the binocs at the yard. This window in the O\u0027Donnell house offered a view of the west and south sides of the place, plus some of the bulkheaded yard along the bay. With a waterfront house, which was the front yard - water side or street side?\n She tracked right to the bulkheaded lagoon that ran along the far side of the house. The cabin cruiser bobbed in the water, moored to the pilings of the small planked dock.\n Farther right she came to the detached garage that sat at the end of the lagoon. Its siding and roof were identical to the house. Weezy hadn\u0027t looked, but assumed Rasalom\u0027s Mercedes rested within.\n She angled her view up and left to the stormy water beyond the house. Out there among the whitecaps, maybe three miles off shore, sat Gardiner\u0027s Island - privately owned and big enough to have its own airstrip.\n Lots of money out here. Some of it old, some of it new. But if Rasalom had his way, none of it would be of any use, no matter what the amount.\n She lowered the glasses and stared at the gray clouds flowing over the bay. Comin\u0027 up a storm, as they said down south. Indeed it was. And that was where the nor\u0027easter lay - to the south.\n She glanced over at the bedroom\u0027s fourteen-inch TV where the Weather Channel\u0027s reporters were salivating over the storm roiling up the coast. D.C. and Baltimore were getting snowed in; Delaware, Jersey, and New York were next in line.\n She hoped Jack got back before it hit too hard.\n They\u0027d left Dawn asleep in the downstairs bedroom and walked to where Weezy had parked the SUV. The short drive into Amagansett gave them a chance to talk. While they waited by the school for the jitney to show, Jack had told her about his conversation with Drexler.\n \"Can you trust him?\" she\u0027d asked.\n Jack had shrugged. \"As long as our agendas overlap, maybe. My agenda is stopping the One. Drexler\u0027s only agenda, now and forever, is Ernst Drexler. At the moment, stopping the One seems good for Drexler. He told me about the Nuckateague house, which we already knew to be true, so I think I can believe that Georges is scheduled to pick up the One at JFK tonight.\"\n \"\u0027The One\u0027 ... I thought we were going to use his name - not around Dawn, of course, but between us.\"\n \"That\u0027s okay back at Glaeken\u0027s place, but I\u0027d like to avoid it out here. Even if he\u0027s no longer paying attention, he might still be aware of it. I don\u0027t want him to have the vaguest hint of what I\u0027m planning.\"\n \"But what is the plan? Dawn\u0027s going to be asking me.\"\n \"It\u0027s still forming, but I can tell you I\u0027m going to do my damnedest to hit him before he reaches the house. He\u0027ll be much harder to take down once he\u0027s inside. Plus, making a move on him in the house could endanger the baby. I promised Dawn I\u0027d get her baby back, and that sort of implies alive and well.\"\n Something in his tone ...\n \"And if you hadn\u0027t promised?\"\n He looked out the side window. \"Let\u0027s not go there.\"\n It seemed to be a moot point anyway, so, okay, she wouldn\u0027t go there. But his attitude started a knot of concern in her chest.\n \"Where do you plan to \u0027hit\u0027 him?\"\n \"On the road ... target his car.\"\n \"What about the driver?\"\n \"What about him?\"\n \"Are you going to \u0027hit\u0027 him too?\"\n \"Not on purpose, but I intend to reduce R\u0027s car to molten slag. And if this guy Georges is in it, well...\"\n \"That\u0027s kind of cold. He\u0027s just his driver.\"\n He turned to her, his expression grim. \"He\u0027s more than \u0027just his driver.\u0027 He\u0027s a member of the Order. You remember them, don\u0027t you? The ones who expended all that effort last year trying to kill you?\"\n She remembered. She found herself shuddering under the covers some nights with the memory.\n \"Touche. Just reflex, I guess. I\u0027m new at this sort of thing.\"\n Jack didn\u0027t seem to be listening. His eyes blazed. \"He\u0027s made a choice as to whose side he\u0027s on. Serve the One, you take your lumps with the One.\"\n He was frightening like this.\n \"What\u0027s happening to you?\"\n \"What\u0027s happening?\" His voice rose. \"Something! We\u0027ve been sitting around doing nothing. Finally something is happening. This is the end game, Weez. We\u0027ve come to the point where we either win it all or lose it all. I\u0027ll get one shot at this guy. If I blow it, there\u0027ll be no second chance. So I\u0027ve got to make that first shot count. No more Mister Nice Guy.\"\n \"Does that mean no niceties like worrying about collateral damage?\"\n He sighed and stared through the windshield at the empty school.\n \"I always worry about that, Weez. And I think I\u0027ve got a way to do this with zero collateral damage. But the driver won\u0027t be collateral. He\u0027s part of the package.\"\n The jitney pulled up then. He turned to her.\n \"Keep an extra close watch on Dawn. Do your mother-hen thing with a vengeance and keep her out of sight and away from the mansion. Gilda and Georges know her. If they spot her, even a passing glimpse, it will blow everything. Just tell her to sit tight. Because if things go according to plan, she\u0027ll have her baby tonight.\"\n \"You\u0027re so sure?\"\n \"I\u0027m not sure of anything. I\u0027m not even sure she\u0027ll still want the baby once she sees it.\"\n \"Why do you say that?\"\n \"Claws? Hair? Tentacles? Sounds like it might have a face even a mother can\u0027t love.\"\n Something in his eyes ...\n \"Do you know something I don\u0027t?\"\n \"No. Just a feeling. But we can deal with that later. If things work out, without Georges and the One around, we can sashay in, tie Gilda to a chair, and waltz out with the baby.\"\n \"And Gilda?\"\n \"When we\u0027re well on our way, we\u0027ll call the local cops and give them her address.\"\n \"Well, at least she won\u0027t be collateral damage. But what if she were in the car?\"\n \"Good-bye, Gilda.\"\n A crazy thought leaped from her brain to her lips.\n \"And what if I were in the car?\"\n He stared at her. \"Now you\u0027re getting stupid. You\u0027re one of the reasons I\u0027m doing this.\"\n And there it was. This was all personal for Jack. He wasn\u0027t acting on behalf of humanity or the Ally, he was doing it for the people he knew and loved and cared about. He didn\u0027t look beyond that circle. He didn\u0027t wish the masses any harm, but they simply weren\u0027t on his radar.\n Knowing she was in that circle sparked a warm feeling that somewhat relieved the chill of his new cold-bloodedness.\n He\u0027d kissed her lightly on the cheek and ran for the bus like a commuter heading for his job in the city.\n Weezy had reparked the car in the trees and walked back here to find Dawn still asleep. Poor kid was knocked out.\n Weezy checked out the mansion again. Nothing moving over there. She rose and stepped back from the window to stretch her aching back. Not the most comfortable chair.\n She realized what she needed to make this bearable: the Compendium of Srem.\n Yeah, that would do it. Sit by the window with the Compendium on her lap, leafing through it, looking up and checking across the street, then back to the Compendium. Multitasking.\n She\u0027d kept coming across that page about the Naming Ceremony, and the more she thought about it, the more she saw it as a possible back door to weakening or even neutralizing Rasalom.\n That wouldn\u0027t matter if Jack succeeded today. But if he failed ...\n And best of all, the Compendium was across the hall. She\u0027d brought it along on the Jersey trip to quiz the Lady on a few points but had never got around to it.\n But first: more coffee. As she headed downstairs to refresh her cup, she peeked in on Dawn and found her sitting on the edge of the bed, yawning.\n \"Hey, sleepyhead.\"\n Dawn gave her a little smile. \"My mom used to call me that.\" And then the smile faded.\n Weezy understood: My mom ...\n She wondered at her feelings for this woman-child. In less than a year Dawn had weathered the murder of her mother, the loss of her home, months as a fugitive and virtual prisoner, pregnancy, childbirth, the abduction of her child and yet ... she was still a vulnerable teenager.\n Jack teased her about Dawn, about how she became all motherly whenever she was around. She supposed it was true.\n Supposed? No. Don\u0027t kid yourself. Own it: She\u0027s some sort of surrogate daughter, the child you never had, never will have.\n Weezy had always assumed she\u0027d be an inept mother. Her emotions had become untethered during her teen years and never fully grounded since; plus she saw herself as too involved in her own little world to give herself fully to a child. Now she wasn\u0027t so sure. Now she wished she\u0027d taken the plunge, because she could have been a damn good mother. And she would have been proud to have a daughter like Dawn. Yes, she\u0027d made some terrible mistakes, some awful decisions that had left her bruised, battered, chipped, and dented, but she still was functioning. That girl had steel in her core.\n But she still needed some guidance, some mothering.\n Weezy could provide that.\n \"How about we make some breakfast together?\"\n Dawn made a face. \"You don\u0027t want anything I cook.\"\n \"You can\u0027t be worse than me. Come on. It\u0027ll be fun.\"\n She glanced toward the front of the house. \"Shouldn\u0027t we be watching the mansion?\"\n \"I\u0027ve been watching it all morning. Nothing shaking over there. We\u0027ll whip up something and eat it by the window. Fair enough?\"\n Dawn smiled. \"Okay. Let\u0027s do it.\"\n When they reached the kitchen, Weezy poured Dawn a cup of coffee.\n \"Hope you like it strong.\"\n \"Like a black hole.\"\n \"Meaning?\"\n \"Milk disappears when you pour it in.\"\n Weezy beamed at her. \"Black-hole coffee. I like that.\"\n Dawn looked around. \"Where\u0027s Jack?\"\n \"Took the jitney into the city.\"\n \"What for?\"\n \"To gather the means to remove the obstacles between you and your baby.\"\n Could she phrase \"murder\" any more obliquely than that?\n \"How is he going to do that?\"\n \"He\u0027s not saying. But he is saying that if all goes according to plan you should have your baby back tonight.\"\n Dawn fumbled her coffee cup, nearly dropping it.\n \"You\u0027re kidding! Tonight?\"\n \"That\u0027s what he said.\"\n \"Does he really mean it?\"\n \"Obviously, you don\u0027t know Jack.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dark-at-the-end/page-41.html","bookId":2554,"book":{"id":2554,"title":"The Dark at the End","description":"Storyline: \n The Dark at the End (Repairman Jack #15) \n Bound by his promise to Glaeken, Jack has refrained from making any direct moves against Rasalom.

Jack is healing at an accelerated rate--much like Glaeken did when he was immortal. This can only mean that Glaeken\u0027s time is almost up and when he dies, Jack takes his place. \n Rasalom continues to plot against the Lady. Twice she has died and returned; a third time and she will be gone, leaving a clear path for the Otherness to infiltrate this reality.

He forms an uneasy alliance with Jack, who is preparing to face their old enemy. \n Meanwhile, Dawn Pickering is searching for her supposedly dead baby. The trail leads her to a mansion in a remote Long Island coastal town, where she discovers a truth she could have never imagined. \n Now the stage is set for Jack\u0027s massive assault on Rasalom. Jack knows he\u0027s got just one shot. But it\u0027s not just a matter of taking out Rasalom: he also must safely retrieve Dawn\u0027s child and minimize collateral damage.
