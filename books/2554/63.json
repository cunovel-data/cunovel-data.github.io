A little girl -\\n\\n \"Vicky!\"\\n\\n She jumped off the couch and ran for the bedroom. She\u0027d given it to Gia and Vicky. The bedroom light came on almost immediately, and when Weezy arrived she found a terrified Vicky huddled against her shaken mother ...\\n\\n ... and the baby standing at the edge of the bed, chewing on the sheet.\\n\\n Vicky was babbling. \"I-I-I opened my eyes and he was right in front of me, staring at me! I was so scared!\"\\n\\n Weezy couldn\u0027t blame the poor kid. She\u0027d left a night light on in case Gia or Vicky had to find their way to the bathroom. She imagined Vicky opening her eyes and seeing that face just inches away.\\n\\n Gia had her arms around her and gave her an extra squeeze. \"It\u0027s okay, hon. He was just looking at you. He likes you.\"\\n\\n \"No! He bit me!\"\\n\\n She held up an index finger. Weezy stood near the foot of the bed, but even from there she could see reddened scrapes where his sharp little teeth had broken the skin.\\n\\n Gia frowned as she examined it. \"Well, now we\u0027ve got a problem. Let\u0027s go clean that up.\"\\n\\n \"Should I wake Jack?\" Weezy said.\\n\\n He\u0027d wanted to stay close by but Weezy had no room for him here - Gia, Vicky, and the baby maxed out her sleepover capacity - so he\u0027d crashed across the hall on Dawn\u0027s couch.\\n\\n Gia shook her head as she hustled Vicky toward the bathroom. \"We can handle this. Let him sleep.\"\\n\\n Weezy glanced at the bedside clock - 3:32 - and then stared at the baby. How on Earth had he gotten from the crib to the bedroom? As Vicky rounded the corner and disappeared, the baby screeched, then dropped to his hands and knees and began to crawl after her.\\n\\n An infant ... crawling ... and biting.\\n\\n What had she brought into her home? \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dark-at-the-end/page-63.html","bookId":2554,"book":{"id":2554,"title":"The Dark at the End","description":"Storyline: The Dark at the End (Repairman Jack #15) \\n Bound by his promise to Glaeken, Jack has refrained from making any direct moves against Rasalom. But things have changed so there\u0027s nothing holding Jack in check any longer. Other changes are occurring as well. Jack is healing at an accelerated rate--much like Glaeken did when he was immortal. This can only mean that Glaeken\u0027s time is almost up and when he dies, Jack takes his place. \\n Rasalom continues to plot against the Lady. Twice she has died and returned; a third time and she will be gone, leaving a clear path for the Otherness to infiltrate this reality. But Ernst Drexler, formerly Rasalom\u0027s go-to guy for logistical support, fears he will be left out in the cold when the Change comes. He forms an uneasy alliance with Jack, who is preparing to face their old enemy. \\n Meanwhile, Dawn Pickering is searching for her supposedly dead baby. The trail leads her to a mansion in a remote Long Island coastal town, where she discovers a truth she could have never imagined. \\n Now the stage is set for Jack\u0027s massive assault on Rasalom. Jack knows he\u0027s got just one shot. But it\u0027s not just a matter of taking out Rasalom: he also must safely retrieve Dawn\u0027s child and minimize collateral damage. So, he comes up with a foolproof plan. \\n But fools are always with usâ€¦.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-dark-at-the-end.jpg","author":"F.
