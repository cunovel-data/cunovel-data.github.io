Look who got invited to the party. I didn\u0027t know if Tyleski had got to you or not.\"\n \"Tyleski?\" The name threw Ernst for a second, then he remembered. \"Oh, yes. That was the name he gave you.\"\n \"Bogus as all hell.\" He raised the paper sack he was carrying. \"But these will bring out the truth. Before the night is over, we\u0027ll know everything about this guy.\"\n Ernst removed the Taser from his pocket and held it up.\n \"This will help too.\"\n \"That\u0027s way too tame, man.\"\n \"But if he is the one who Tasered us last summer, it is only fair, no?\"\n Thompson grinned. \"Well, maybe for appetizers.\"\n The elevator stopped at the top floor and he let Thompson lead the way across the foyer.\n \"Hey, everybody,\" he said as he opened the door to the loft. \"It\u0027s party ti - \"\n He stopped dead one step inside the threshold. Ernst was expecting that but purposely ran into him from behind, pushing him farther into the room.\n \"Oh, shit!\" Thompson cried. \"Oh, fuck!\"\n Ernst put on a suitably shocked expression and pushed past him. Perhaps only partially put on. It always surprised him how much blood the human body contained. And when it ran out through multiple large exit wounds, it formed pools of remarkable size. These three pools had merged into a crimson lake. Clotting had begun.\n Thompson seemed mesmerized by the blood, but he tore his gaze away and focused on the empty chair.\n \"He\u0027s gone!\"\n \"Yes, I can see that,\" Ernst said.\n \"But how? Szeto and I taped him into that chair ourselves. No way he could have gotten out.\"\n Ernst stepped around the pool of blood and inspected the chair.\n \"Tape? What tape? There is no tape here.\"\n \"There\u0027s gotta be!\" Thompson\u0027s eyes looked ready to pop from his head. \"What the fuck\u0027s going on?\"\n \"Szeto once told me he thought he was a ninja.\"\n \"A ninja? Naw, he was just some American guy, but this - this is like supernatural!\" He looked around. \"We better get out of here.\"\n \"I think that is wise.\"\n \"What about the bodies?\"\n This encounter had served its purpose. The Order would want answers. Ernst would say he arrived and found them all dead. Thompson would back that up. But Ernst would wonder aloud about Thompson ... the last to see the three men alive ... or had they been alive when he\u0027d left? He claimed to have taped the stranger into the chair, but no tape was evident when Ernst arrived ... could he be working with the stranger?\n The Order would find no evidence of that, but the questions would focus attention on Thompson while Ernst searched for clues to the One\u0027s whereabouts.\n Even better, the One might contact him. Since he could no longer go to Szeto for \"minor logistical support,\" as he\u0027d called it, would he turn again to Ernst Drexler? Ernst hoped so.\n If that happened, and if Ernst regained the One\u0027s trust and favor, the deal with Jack would be null and void. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dark-at-the-end/page-29.html","bookId":2554,"book":{"id":2554,"title":"The Dark at the End","description":"Storyline: \n The Dark at the End (Repairman Jack #15) \n Bound by his promise to Glaeken, Jack has refrained from making any direct moves against Rasalom. But things have changed so there\u0027s nothing holding Jack in check any longer. Other changes are occurring as well. Jack is healing at an accelerated rate--much like Glaeken did when he was immortal. This can only mean that Glaeken\u0027s time is almost up and when he dies, Jack takes his place. \n Rasalom continues to plot against the Lady. Twice she has died and returned; a third time and she will be gone, leaving a clear path for the Otherness to infiltrate this reality. But Ernst Drexler, formerly Rasalom\u0027s go-to guy for logistical support, fears he will be left out in the cold when the Change comes. He forms an uneasy alliance with Jack, who is preparing to face their old enemy. \n Meanwhile, Dawn Pickering is searching for her supposedly dead baby. The trail leads her to a mansion in a remote Long Island coastal town, where she discovers a truth she could have never imagined. \n Now the stage is set for Jack\u0027s massive assault on Rasalom. Jack knows he\u0027s got just one shot. But it\u0027s not just a matter of taking out Rasalom: he also must safely retrieve Dawn\u0027s child and minimize collateral damage. So, he comes up with a foolproof plan. \n But fools are always with usâ€¦.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-dark-at-the-end.jpg","author":"F.
