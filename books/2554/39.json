{"id":111896,"no":39,"title":"Page 39","content":"\"I\u0027m glad you called,\" Ernst said when he recognized Jack\u0027s voice. He meant it. \"I have uncovered some information and didn\u0027t know how to contact you.\"\n \"I\u0027m all ears.\"\n \"I proceeded in a circumspect manner, pretending to look for one thing while really looking for another.\"\n \"And?\"\n Impatience was already creeping into Jack\u0027s tone. Well, too bad. Ernst\u0027s information could not be fully appreciated without the details of the quest.\n He glanced around his apartment. Hard to believe that only twenty-four hours ago Jack had invaded his home and threatened him. In the ensuing hours Ernst had become responsible for the deaths of three of his brothers in the Order and had joined forces with Jack against the One. An almost unthinkable turnaround in any length of time, but a day?\n All the One\u0027s doing, of course. He had deserted Ernst, not the other way around.\n \"Do you know the name of the One\u0027s housekeeper?\"\n \"Gilda.\"\n Ernst felt his eyebrows lift. Odd that Jack would know. Only the very upper echelons of the Order were aware of that. Well, here was something he would not know ...\n \"Are you aware of her last name?\"\n \"Not a clue.\"\n That was a relief, in a way.\n \"The Order has supplied logistical support and personnel to the One for millennia. His current driver/assistant - \"\n \"Georges.\"\n \"Yes ... correct.\"\n Did Jack have a source high up in the Order? His friend Edward Connell would be privy to none of this. Who then?\n \"Georges is a member of the Order. When the One needed a female to deal with a certain matter - \"\n \"That matter being Dawn Pickering, right? Does this train have a caboose?\"\n Of course - the pregnant Pickering girl had lived in the One\u0027s house and was no doubt in touch with Jack now. She was the source.\n He felt better.\n \"Since the Order does not admit female members, a relative of one of the brothers was recruited for the housekeeper position. Gilda\u0027s son\u0027s name was Kristof ... Kristof Szeto.\"\n \"Ah. Like mother, like son, I gather. But so what?\"\n \"Well, I could not very well draw attention to myself by going to the High Council and inquiring directly as to the One\u0027s whereabouts. Instead I asked about Kristof Szeto\u0027s mother so that I might offer my condolences, seeing as how her son and I had such a close working relationship.\"\n \"Pretty close dying relationship too.\"\n \"Yes, well, be that as it may, I learned her location but I was instructed not to approach her. She\u0027s still being used by the One and has not been informed of her son\u0027s demise because it might distract her from her duties.\"\n A short, bitter laugh. \"You guys are all heart.\"\n \"Never mind that. She will be told at a later date. The important thing is that locating her is the same as locating the One.\"\n \"Not necessarily. I\u0027ve been to the Nuckateague place - she\u0027s there, but he\u0027s not.\"\n The words shocked Ernst.\n \"You know about Nuckateague? How can you possibly - ?\"\n \"Vee haff vays.\"\n If that was supposed to be a German accent, it was terrible.\n Ernst felt unaccountably crushed. He thought he\u0027d been quite clever in ferreting out the location without allowing the slightest hint of what he was really looking for. And here Jack had found it without him.\n \"So if he\u0027s not at the house,\" Jack said, \"where is he?\"\n Ernst wanted to say, You mean there is something you do not already know?\n \"I do not know.\"\n \"Then what good - ?\"\n \"But I know where he will be.\"\n \"Where?\"\n \"JFK Airport at six P.M. tomorrow evening. Georges is scheduled to pick him up then and drive him to the Nuckateague house.\"\n During the ensuing silence Ernst thought of how fortuitous it was that the High Council required Georges and Gilda to log in regarding their duties. Gilda was apparently taking care of the Pickering baby now, while Georges had what could only be described as a cushy assignment - few duties in luxurious surroundings. With the One away - no one knew where - he quite literally had nothing to do.\n \"Six o\u0027clock tomorrow night,\" Jack said. \"You\u0027re sure?\"\n \"I\u0027m sure that is what Georges told the Council. Whether or not it will change, I have no idea.\"\n \"All right. Thanks.\"\n And then he was gone. Ernst laid his phone on the table.\n Thanks ...\n No ... thank you ... if you succeed.\n Would Jack make his move tomorrow? He seemed impatient to have this done with, but he also seemed very cautious ... a careful planner.\n But even the most carefully laid plan could go awry, usually because of the simplest little thing. Some unpredictable mishap, some unforeseeable variable completely outside the plan could change everything.\n If Jack succeeded, excellent. If he failed, Ernst would stand ready to assist the One in any way humanly possible.\n Yes, though he foresaw little chance of success, from the depths of his heart Ernst wished Jack luck. The best of luck. Eliminating the One would save the entire world from a terrible fate.\n But most important, it would save Ernst Drexler. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-dark-at-the-end/page-39.html","bookId":2554,"book":{"id":2554,"title":"The Dark at the End","description":"Storyline: \n The Dark at the End (Repairman Jack #15) \n Bound by his promise to Glaeken, Jack has refrained from making any direct moves against Rasalom. But things have changed so there\u0027s nothing holding Jack in check any longer. Other changes are occurring as well. Jack is healing at an accelerated rate--much like Glaeken did when he was immortal. This can only mean that Glaeken\u0027s time is almost up and when he dies, Jack takes his place. \n Rasalom continues to plot against the Lady. Twice she has died and returned; a third time and she will be gone, leaving a clear path for the Otherness to infiltrate this reality. But Ernst Drexler, formerly Rasalom\u0027s go-to guy for logistical support, fears he will be left out in the cold when the Change comes. He forms an uneasy alliance with Jack, who is preparing to face their old enemy. \n Meanwhile, Dawn Pickering is searching for her supposedly dead baby. The trail leads her to a mansion in a remote Long Island coastal town, where she discovers a truth she could have never imagined. \n Now the stage is set for Jack\u0027s massive assault on Rasalom. Jack knows he\u0027s got just one shot. But it\u0027s not just a matter of taking out Rasalom: he also must safely retrieve Dawn\u0027s child and minimize collateral damage.
