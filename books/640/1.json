{"id":11303,"no":1,"title":"PREFACE","content":"A few months before the lamented death of my husband—I might say even as the shadow of death was over him—he planned three series of short stories for publication, and the present volume is one of them. To his original list of stories in this book, I have added an hitherto unpublished episode from Dracula. It was originally excised owing to the length of the book, and may prove of interest to the many readers of what is considered my husband\u0027s most remarkable work. The other stories have already been published in English and American periodicals. Had my husband lived longer, he might have seen fit to revise this work, which is mainly from the earlier years of his strenuous life. But, as fate has entrusted to me the issuing of it, I consider it fitting and proper to let it go forth practically as it was left by him. \\n\\n \\n\\n FLORENCE BRAM STOKER \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3247/88987.html","bookId":640,"book":{"id":640,"title":"Dracula\u0027s Guest","description":"简介： He crossed himself, as he answered laconically: \u0027Walpurgis nacht.\u0027 Then he took out his watch, a great, old-fashioned German silver thing as big as a turnip, and looked at it, with his eyebrows gathered together and a little impatient shrug of his sh...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Short Story","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3247","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:05 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:19:05 AM"}}
