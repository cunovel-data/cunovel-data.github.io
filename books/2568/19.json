Worst case is that everyone’ll think Boyd here just went off his nut. I can make that work for us.” He listened again. “Sure, but it’s all based on whether Boyd will do what we say. He should have stayed out of town, should have gone to ground, but here he is, big as life and twice as ugly. If it was me, I’d cap him right now. Got those special rounds in your old Luger—they’d take Shitbag here down quick as you please, then I could leave him where he can be found and then let things go quiet for a while. Halloween’s coming fast, and cops crawling up everyone’s ass could slow things down.” He listened again, sighed, and nodded reluctantly. “Okay, I can see that…but I still think we should dump this one and just work on the other one. Well…the other three now. Maybe they won’t be brain damaged like this useless turd.” Vic leaned forward, his face, his eyes, his entire being focused on the center of the swamp. “You know I will, Boss. One thing in all the world you never need to do is doubt that. But if Boyd here steps out of line one more time—if he endangers the plan one more time—useful or not I’m going to put him down like a broke-dick dog. I won’t let anything stop the Red Wave. Not anything, and not anyone living or dead.” He listened again and his face slowly registered surprise, eyebrows arching, and he looked from the swamp to Boyd and back again. “You can do that? You can—what word am I looking for here, boss?—you can dial up the brainpower on this moron?” He grinned like a kid. “That’s just too cool! But let’s not overdo it. Just enough to make him toe the line and maybe help with some fetch-and-carry nigger work I got to get done.” Beside him, Boyd dropped down onto hands and knees and then leaned forward until he was able to dip his whole face into the swamp. He lay there for ten minutes, buried head and shoulders in the black bubbling ichor of Griswold’s grave. When he eventually pulled back a green-black slime oozed from his ears and nose and mouth. Boyd got slowly to his feet and staggered back to the treeline, watching Vic with eyes that were a shade less milky and bland. Not intelligent eyes, but eyes that showed the dawning of an animal cunning that had not been there before. Vic bent and ground out his cigarette, then slid off the chair onto his knees and also fell forward onto his palms, leaning out over the edge of the swamp and craning his neck out and down until his face was nearly touching the mud. He did not immerse his face in the mud, but instead closed his eyes and bent further still and kissed the roiling surface of the swamp. “With all my soul and all my hated, I am for thee,” he said, and it was the closing line of a ritual that he had acted out many hundreds of times, and which others had acted out many tens of thousands of times before him. Boyd, watching, tried to understand and, just for a moment, felt a stab of jealousy spear him through the heart. (4) Every reporter in the region had the story of the killing of Jimmy Castle and Nels Cowan, and it was front-page news from D.C. to Boston, riding as it was on the coattails of the hostage-murder drama at the Guthrie farm. Locally it was big enough to earn program interruptions for news bulletins. Nationally it was above the fold in the morning editions and below the fold by the evening press. By morning it would have faded into inside stories everywhere except in eastern Pennsylvania and parts of New Jersey. Then the October 2 morning edition of the Black Marsh Sentinel came out with an exclusive by reporter Willard Fowler Newton. The headline said it all: CAPE MAY KILLER SLAIN IN PINE DEEP AMERICA’S MOST WANTED MAN KILLS THREE, DIES IN HAIL OF GUNFIRE POLICE COVER-UP SUSPECTED Newton’s article had about the same effect as tossing a hand grenade into a crowded room—everyone was blown away. The Sentinel, knowing it had one hell of a story, printed four times the usual number of copies and churned out special editions all through the day. By seven-thirty that morning, the radio stations had picked it up and were force-feeding it to the commuters in five counties; by nine it hit the bigger affiliates and the story again went national. TV reporters quoted it verbatim because their field reporters did not have a single fact aside from the regularly issued—and clearly evasive—press releases from the mayor’s office and the chief’s office. Not one of those press releases had so much as whispered “Cape May Killer,” let alone suggest that the man responsible for the attack at Guthrie Farm was the same killer. It was top Philadelphia Daily News columnist Nick Robertson who first linked the story to Pine Deep’s haunted history with a story headlined SERIAL KILLER IN SPOOKTOWN. On CBS, Gail Harkins, her face frowning in concern, talked about how the “tragic events of last night were the latest chapter in a centuries-long history of menace, mystery, and murder in this quiet, upscale town.” Mitzie Malone of New York’s Channel 9, speaking in a hushed haunted-house voice, said that “in a town that boasts the country’s greatest number of spooky stories and campfire tales you would think that one more monster on the loose would not be noticed—but this monster is not out of a fireside yarn. This monster (dramatic pause) is real.” The evening commentator for Fox News called Karl Ruger the “ghostmaker,” hoping it would stick. It didn’t. Instead Ruger was simply labeled a “monster” and that was appropriate enough. None of the reporters seemed to be able to keep their stories free of clichés. The term “macabre” racked up a lot of mileage; every lurid adjective was dragged out and squeezed into the Who, What, Where, Why, When, and How of the story. For the first half of the day, though, the Black Marsh Sentinel owned the story. By ten that morning Dick Hangood was sitting at his desk with a smug grin on his face as he watched the way the story broke on the networks. Every time one of Newton’s sentences was quoted, Hangood made a tick mark on a scratch pad. By noon the page was black with them. Newton himself was in the middle of it, and the other reporters were elbowing each other out of the way to interview him. Fired up by his first major story, and by the celebrity that came with the exclusive of the year, if not the decade, he held court in front of the chief’s office, which was thronged with scared and angry townsfolk and a swarm of reporters from all over the eastern seaboard. One side effect of Newton’s story was that angry attention was suddenly focused on local government, a furor deliberately fueled by the news media who, as one, cranked up their studied self-righteousness and demanded—ostensibly on behalf of The Public, but actually on behalf of their ratings—that the mayor’s office and the police department respond to the allegations of a cover-up. Harry LeBeau responded by closing his shop and sneaking out the back way in order to head home and hide. Terry, for his part, was reading the papers and watching the news, and thinking it all through. This was becoming a make-or-break situation, and it had to be played just right. His nerves were beginning to grow taut again and he could feel the claws of the beast scratching at the inside of his brain. So, the press descended on the police department. Gus Bernhardt, his face as red as a boiled lobster, hemmed and hawed as he tried to field eighty questions at once, most of them accusatory. Why had he not informed the public of the danger? Why was there a cover-up? How could the authorities let such a dangerous man walk around free? Sergeant Ferro was so tired and disgusted by all that had happened that he had the perverse urge to let the chief sink under the tide of questions, but a couple of the city journalists recognized him and immediately he was barraged. Unlike Bernhardt, Ferro was used to press conferences, and he had his own method for dealing with the pressure. He gave answers that were so dry and boring that most reporters found listening to him excruciating. Willard Fowler Newton was not so easily dissuaded; he grilled Ferro with questions like machine-gun fire and after a few minutes even Ferro found himself tripping over his words and casting around for an exit. Standing to one side, LaMastra fought valiantly not to crack a visible smile. Then at the stroke of one, the back door to the chief’s office banged open and through it walked Terry Wolfe. He wore a white shirt with the sleeves rolled up, a dark blue tie loosened at the throat, and he had unbuttoned the top two shirt buttons. His hair was just slightly tousled and his curly red beard looked a little wild. The effect was that of a man who has been seriously at work all night, a man who has been in the trenches. He walked right through the middle of the crowd, which yielded and parted for him (though they continued to babble questions at him), past a grateful Gus Bernhardt and a skeptical Ferro—who had become convinced the mayor had wigged out—and stopped in the precise center of the crowd. Everyone was speaking at once, yelling, demanding, imploring, reviling, questioning, accusing, but Terry said nothing, did nothing other than fix his blueberry eyes on the nearest reporter and then turn very slowly in a full circle, making deliberate eye contact with as many people as possible. His stare was as hard and unfaltering as a statue’s, and from the subtle arch of one eyebrow and the set of his stern mouth it was clear that he was not going to speak until he had a more attentive and respectful audience. He did not say a word, but gradually every voice faltered and grew silent. By the time he completed the full turn the crowded office was totally quiet except for the rustling of clothes and a small, embarrassed cough here and there. Ferro, watching, was impressed. He and LaMastra exchanged a brief look. “This should be good,” LaMastra murmured. Terry had prepared himself for this moment. Since calling Gus late yesterday he had spent hours getting himself calm, gathering all the details, mentally rehearsing his comments, and listening to all the updates from the news services. Terry felt like ten miles of poorly paved back road, but he had showered, and dressed in the kind of outfit that would project the image he wanted the people of his town to see: not a shifty politician dodging the situation, but a leader of the people who was there on the front lines with the troops. Not an Italian suit but rolled-up shirtsleeves and all of the long hours stamped on his face. He crammed the other things—the hallucinations, the monstrous mirror images he was seeing, and the fear—into a closet in the back of his mind and made himself be The Mayor. He was good at this sort of stuff, and he knew it; and it was not all artifice—he genuinely cared about his town, though he rarely had a chance to show it. Right now, though, he needed to show a lot of it. He needed to be The Man in Charge. He waited out the silence, standing nearly six-five and powerful in the center of the reporters, few of whom were anywhere near his height, and none of them his equal in gravitas.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/dead-man-s-song-pine-deep-2/page-19.html","bookId":2568,"book":{"id":2568,"title":"Dead Man\u0027s Song (Pine Deep #2)","description":"Storyline: Dead Man\u0027s Song (Pine Deep #2) From the powerful imagination of a new horror master comes a bone-chilling tale set in a small town where good and evil are joined in a terrifying, deadly battle...
