{"id":12480,"no":23,"title":"CHAPTER XXIII DAYBREAK","content":"Even as she spoke the words, and as though in answer to the question he had asked, a faint smell of burning filled the air of the room, and through one of the chinks, like a little gray snake, a wreath of smoke coiled upward, clinging to the woodwork. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"So that\u0027s what they were doing!\" cried Floyd. \"They have fired the house.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Through every chink and crevice a curl of smoke was licking upward, and now came the sharp, crackling sound of brushwood burning and the snap and hiss of sticks blazing alight. \\n\\n \\n\\n The air of the room was already turned to a gray haze of smoke, smoke that made the eyes smart, the smoke of burning hibiscus and poison oak and bay cedar bush, choking and suffocating fumes, followed now by flames as the wretches outside flung coconut shells on the fire, shells that blazed like flare lamps once ignited. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"The place will burn like a torch,\" said Floyd, \"once the scantling gets alight. Listen! What\u0027s that above? They have got on the roof; they are lighting it. We must quit and make a dash for the dinghy. It\u0027s our only chance. Wait!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He rushed into the smaller room, and returned with[Pg 192] something in his hands. It was the tin box holding the pearls. \\n\\n \\n\\n He opened it, emptied the contents wrapped in cotton wool, and filled his pockets. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m not going to leave these behind,\" said he, speaking as if to himself. Then to Isbel: \"Take a revolver and this package of ammunition. I\u0027ll take the other and a rifle. Unbar the door and run first. Don\u0027t stop to fire unless you can\u0027t help. Hark! What\u0027s that?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n A sound like a sharp clap of thunder shook the air and was followed by a yell from the grove behind the house and from the beach on either side. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Open the door!\" said Floyd. \\n\\n \\n\\n Isbel undid the bars, and flung the door wide. Instantly the draft settling from the grove filled the place with volumes of smoke. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Now,\" said Floyd, \"run!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n They dashed out of the house, across the beach, running, half blind with the effects of the smoke. They had expected a flight of spears. They found instead an empty beach, full dawn, and a reef over which the last of their assailants were scrambling. \\n\\n \\n\\n A great white cloud filled the break of the reef. It was the Southern Cross coming in with a fair wind and a flooding tide. \\n\\n \\n\\n The first rays of the sun were on her topsails, which the wind scarcely filled. The water under her was still violet with night. White gulls, rose-colored gulls, golden gulls, as the sunrise took them, were flocking and screaming in the pale sapphire above her, schooner, gulls, lagoon, and sky making a picture more lovely than a dream. \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 193]As she cleared the reef entrance and rounded to her anchorage, the wind spilling out of her sails, a plume of smoke broke from her, and again the report of a gun shook the island. \\n\\n \\n\\n As it died away the splash of the anchor was followed by a roar of the chain through the hawse pipe, and the Southern Cross, her long, long journey over, lay at her moorings swinging to the incoming tide. \\n\\n \\n\\n Isbel turned to Floyd and clung to him, weeping. All her courage had suddenly vanished now that there was no need for it. \\n\\n \\n\\n Floyd, holding her tight in his arms, kissed her black, perfumed hair. The flower had fallen, but a trace of its scent remained. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was the moment of his life, and then she drew away from him, cast one dark glance obliquely up at him, and stood with her breast heaving and both hands shading her eyes. \\n\\n \\n\\n She was looking over the water in the direction of the Southern Cross. \\n\\n \\n\\n The schooner was lowering a boat. It was the whaleboat, and Floyd saw the men tumbling into her, followed by a white-clad figureâ€”Schumer. \\n\\n \\n\\n Even at that distance he recognized Schumer. Following Schumer came another white-clad figure, evidently a European. \\n\\n \\n\\n Besides the two white men there were twelve hands in the boat, fourteen in all, and as she approached rapidly, urged by the long ash sweeps, Floyd saw the rifles with which the men were armed, the barrels showing as they rested, muzzle upward, by the seats. \\n\\n \\n\\n As the boat came ashore Schumer, from his place in the stern sheets, waved his hand to Floyd. Then the[Pg 194] fellows, jumping out, beached the boat, and Schumer, following them, set foot on the sand. \\n\\n \\n\\n He did not waste words. \\n\\n \\n\\n He had seen the whole business at a glance, and he had brought canvas buckets. Dense columns of smoke were rising from the back part of the house, but the roof had fortunately not caught alight. The crew had their orders, and in a moment they were filling the buckets and carrying them up to the grove while Schumer, Floyd, and the newcomer helped and superintended. \\n\\n \\n\\n The mutineers had piled stacks of underwood, sticks, and all the rubbish they could find against the house wall. The stuff was burning with more smoke than flame, and the fire had fortunately taken no considerable hold on the building. They kicked the rubbish aside, flung water on the wall, and in twenty minutes or so the situation was saved. \\n\\n \\n\\n Isbel had been posted by Schumer as a lookout in case the enemy should return. She had not contented herself by standing by as a watch, but had gone as far as the grove end, from where the reef could be seen up to the pierhead. She had seen nothing. The whole crowd of the enemy, in fact, had scattered back to the fishing camp by the road they had come the night before, and Schumer, standing now on the beach, could see them through his glass congregated about the tents. \\n\\n \\n\\n Then he turned to Floyd. \"Well,\" said he, \"you seem to have had a lively time. What was the bother?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Floyd explained in a few words, and, Isbel not being by, told of the trouble with Sru. \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 195]\"He was plotting mischief all the time,\" said Floyd, \"and this is the result.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well,\" said Schumer, \"we will deal with the gentleman all in good time. What luck have you had with the pearls?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Floyd told. \\n\\n \\n\\n Taking off his coat, and laying it on the sands, he began to remove the pearls, in their casings of cotton wool, from the pockets. He explained why he had placed them there, and, as he went on with the work, Schumer and the stranger, standing by, looked on. \\n\\n \\n\\n Schumer up to this had been too busy to introduce the newcomer. He did so now. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"This is Captain Hakluyt,\" said he. \"He\u0027s in this venture, as I will explain to you afterward. His firm owns the Southern Cross.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Floyd looked up, and nodded to Hakluyt. \\n\\n \\n\\n The new man\u0027s face was not a certificate of character. There are faces that repel at first sight, and Hakluyt\u0027s was one of them. \\n\\n \\n\\n He had the appearance, not so much of a man who was ill, but of a man who never enjoyed good health. An?mic looking despite his exposure to sun and wind, he seemed unable to bear either the full light of the sun or a full gaze. He was continually blinking, and to Floyd in that moment he suggested vividly the idea of a sick owl. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was the curve of the nose and the blinking of the eyelids that produced this impression. The eyes themselves were not at all owllike, being small and set close together. \\n\\n \\n\\n The whole figure of the man matched his face, slight and mean, with shoulders sloping like the shoulders of[Pg 196] a champagne bottle. It was a figure that no tailor could improve. \\n\\n \\n\\n His hands, as he stood with the thumbs in the armholes of his waistcoat, showed lean and clawlike, birdlike. Birdlike is the term best suited for the whole man; light, restless, peering, and without grace, for it is a fact that the animal and the bird translated into human terms lose both grace and nobility. Man standing or falling by his approach or recession to the type, man. \\n\\n \\n\\n As Floyd looked up from his work he took in Hakluyt\u0027s appearance fully for the first time, and the idea that this man was the new partner in their concern filled him with repulsion and uneasiness. \\n\\n \\n\\n He had been on the point of exposing the pearls triumphantly to view, but in a flash he altered his decision, and, asking them to wait for a moment, left his work and ran up to the house for the tin cash box from which he had taken them. \\n\\n \\n\\n He placed it on the sand, and packing in the precious cotton-wool-covered parcels, closed the lid and handed it to Schumer. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We can examine them afterward,\" said he. \"Keep them for the present. They are not a bad lot, but they might be better.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"We\u0027ll put them in the house,\" replied Schumer. \"I\u0027ve got a safe on board; brought it from Sydney, but I can\u0027t get it ashore till to-morrow. Meanwhile they\u0027ll be all right in the house. Well, Hakluyt, what do you think of the island?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Hakluyt looked about him as though taking stock of the place for the first time. \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 197]\"It is not so bad,\" said he. \"It is a fair bit of a lagoon, but it might be bigger.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, it will be big enough for us,\" replied Schumer, with a laugh. \"Come up to the house with me, Floyd, till I put this stuff away. I want to have a talk with you.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n They left Hakluyt, and walked up to the house. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I say,\" said Floyd, \"if that\u0027s our new man I don\u0027t like the look of him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Schumer laughed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He\u0027s not a beauty,\" said he, \"but he\u0027s the best I could find. He\u0027s Hakluyt \u0026 Son. He\u0027s the son; the father\u0027s dead. He\u0027s in a good way of business as a shipowner and ship\u0027s chandler in Sydney. He has got the money and the means to help us. I have drawn up a contract with him; he gets a third share.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"A third share. That means that the total profits will be divided into three parts. One for you, one for me, and one for Hakluyt.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Just so,\" said Schumer, \"and you pay me for the trade goods we salved from the Tonga.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Of course,\" said Floyd, \"but it seems to me that Hakluyt ought to stand in with me and pay something.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I suggested that, but he refused. He would only come into the deal on condition that he got a third share of the profits without deduction.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Floyd felt inclined to grumble at this. Hakluyt would have the benefit of those goods or what was left of them, but he said nothing. He wanted explanation on another point. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How about the Southern Cross?\" said he. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"In what way?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 198]\"Well, we salved her, didn\u0027t we, or as good as salved her? Hakluyt ought to pay for that.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It was this way,\" replied Schumer. \"Before coming into the venture he wanted half profits. He gave me to understand that our connection with the Southern Cross was in no way a salving job, since the crew were on board, and he said straight out that he would fight the matter in the courts. Now, as he has lots of money to fight with, and we have none, or next to none, I didn\u0027t see any sense in that. He said to me: \u0027I\u0027ll tell you what I\u0027ll do. In recognition of your trouble in bringing the schooner back to Sydney, I\u0027ll be content to take only a third of the profits in this pearling business. What\u0027s more, I will use the schooner for it free of charge and victual and man her.\u0027 \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Now, that seemed to me a fair proposition, and I agreed to it. What do you say?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Floyd did not reply for a moment. He could come to no decision. The whole thing was so intricate and the values involved were such unknown qualities that at last he gave it up. If Schumer was satisfied it was doubtless all right. Schumer knew more of business affairs than he did, and it was better to leave it at that. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well,\" said he, \"I suppose you couldn\u0027t do better, but it seems to me Hakluyt won\u0027t do badly out of the business. Wait till I show you something.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n They had reached the house, and, taking the cash box from Schumer, Floyd placed it on the table and opened it. \\n\\n \\n\\n He carefully removed some of the contents till he came to the package he was looking for; then, carefully removing the cotton wool from it, he exposed the pink pearl. \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 199]\"Heavens, man!\" said Schumer. \"Why didn\u0027t you tell me of this?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Wait!\" said Floyd. \\n\\n \\n\\n He took another small ball of wool from the box, unrolled the wool, and held out the big white pearl. \\n\\n \\n\\n Schumer laughed. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Any more?\" he asked. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Not of that size,\" replied Floyd. \"Well, what do you think of them?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Think of them? They are a fortune in themselves.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He carefully rolled them up again and replaced them in the box. \\n\\n \\n\\n Meanwhile Floyd had been unpacking other specimens, which Schumer examined in their turn. He seemed well pleased with the take since his absence, as well he might be. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I will have the safe brought ashore to-morrow,\" said he. \"Meanwhile they will be all right here. Put them all back and come on. We have to tackle these scamps now and bring them to their senses. I don\u0027t want any fighting, if possible, for that would mean killing more of them, and we want them all for the fishery.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Do you mean to say you are going to trust them to work again?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Of course I am. Why, man, it is nothing when one is working fellows like these to have revolts and rows. You shouldn\u0027t have let them get so much out of hand. I don\u0027t blame you, mind, for you are new to the business, but in the first instance you should have dealt properly with Sru. You should have shot him after that business about the girl. Martial law is the[Pg 200] only law by which you can hold your own in a case like this. Well, we will see. Take your gun and come along.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n They went out, and Schumer ordered the whaleboat to be manned. \\n\\n \\n\\n Floyd for the first time recognized that the crew of the whaleboat were the same Kanakas who had formed the original crew of the Southern Cross. Mountain Joe was one of them. He saluted Floyd when he was recognized, and then took his place as stroke oar. Each man had a rifle and seemed to know how to use it, and they had all the stamp of men reliant and trained to arms. \\n\\n \\n\\n They were not the same menâ€”viewed as fighting menâ€”that Schumer had taken away with him. He had done wonders with them in his absence, and the thought suddenly occurred to Floyd: Did Schumer expect that there would be trouble on the island during his absence? Did he train and arm the crew of the Southern Cross in view of this possible trouble? \\n\\n \\n\\n It seemed so. \\n\\n \\n\\n Then came another thought: Suppose you had been defeated and killed, would not Schumer have benefited? There would have been one partner the less, and ought he not to have warned you more especially as to the danger of a revolt? \\n\\n \\n\\n Schumer had, in fact, warned him casually to be on the lookout, but his warning had chiefly to do with the cache and the necessity of preventing its locality and contents from becoming known. He had not dwelt on the matter of a possible revolt, nor had he prepared plans to meet it. \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 201]Did he hope to return and find a clear field and his partner put out of the way? \\n\\n \\n\\n Floyd instantly dismissed the idea as unworthy of himself and Schumer. He had no tittle of real evidence to support such an ideaâ€”yet it had occurred to him. \\n\\n \\n\\n There are some ideas that arise not from any concrete basis, but from vague suggestions. This was one of them. \\n\\n \\n\\n As they approached the fishing beach they could see the enemy scuttering about in alarm. Fellows came out of the tents, shaded their eyes for a second, and then darted off into the grove. In less than a minute not a soul was in sight. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"There\u0027ll be no fighting,\" said Schumer as the boat came to the beach, and they sprang out. \"Floyd, you stay here with the men and I\u0027ll take Mountain Joe up to the wood edge and have a palaver. I\u0027ll leave my gun with you so they may see we\u0027ve come for peace, not war. They are sure to be peeping and spying from the trees.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n He left the rifle, and, taking Joe with him, walked steadily up from the lagoon edge to the grove. Twenty paces from the trees he stopped and began to speak. \\n\\n \\n\\n Floyd could hear his voice, and it was strange enough to see him standing there and seemingly addressing the trees. \\n\\n \\n\\n Mountain Joe also put in a word now and then as if on his own account. \\n\\n \\n\\n The effect was absolutely negative, and Floyd expected to see them turn and come back. \\n\\n \\n\\n But Schumer knew the native mind and its ways, and he did not seem the least disconcerted at his failure.[Pg 202] He paused in his oration, walked up and down a bit, and then began to talk again. \\n\\n \\n\\n Presently, not from the trees before him, but from the trees at the left-hand side of the grove, a native appeared. He stood for a moment, now resting on one foot, now on the other. Then he said a few words, to which Schumer replied. \\n\\n \\n\\n They kept this up for a minute or so, and then, from the wood, another native joined the first, then another and another. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They are all right now,\" cried Schumer to Floyd. \"Come up and help to jaw them. Leave your gun behind.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Floyd handed his rifle to one of the men and came right up to the group of natives before whom Schumer was now standing. He was talking to them, to use his own expression, like a Dutch uncle. Talking as only he knew how. \\n\\n \\n\\n The Polynesian native, pick him up in most places, has a good deal of humor in his composition. He can both feel and use sarcasm. He has over and above this a certain bonhomie, a good spirit readily worked if one knows how. \\n\\n \\n\\n Schumer knew how. He did not speak them fair by any means. He told them what was in his mind about them, told them they were pigs who would have dashed to their own destruction but for his arrival, yet told them it in a way that did not stir resentment. \\n\\n \\n\\n These half-civilized creatures had been cast right back into savagery by some influence beyond their control. Sru had not been the influence, but he had worked it, just as a sorcerer might raise a devil. \\n\\n \\n\\n Sru had not yet made his appearance. Schumer[Pg 203] asked for him, and the reply came that he was dead and lying over somewhere in the grove near the house. One of the stray shots fired by Floyd while the brushwood was being placed against the house wall had found Sru and sent him to his last account. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well,\" said Schumer, \"that\u0027s the best news we have had yet. It clears up everything. You don\u0027t want to punish these fellows, do you? Seems to me you have given them a pretty good grueling already, three dead and several wounded.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I don\u0027t want to punish them,\" said Floyd. \"You can tell them I call it quits. Sru was the man most to blame, and now he is dead. But there is one man I have a grudge againstâ€”Timauâ€”and I don\u0027t see him here.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Timau,\" said Schumer. \"Which one is that?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He\u0027s a fellow whose life I saved at a great deal of risk and trouble. He stepped into one of those big clamshells and got seized, and I managed to free him, but he\u0027s not here.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Schumer turned to the natives and asked them where Timau was; then he translated to Floyd. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It seems he wouldn\u0027t take part in the business because you had brought him back from the dead.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"So I did, with artificial respiration.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Just soâ€”and Sru bound him and put him in one of the tents. He\u0027s there now. We had better go and loose him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n They walked up to the tents, and there sure enough they found Timau lying on his side and chewing tobacco. He had managed to get one arm free and could have freed himself entirely had he taken the trouble. He had not. He just lay there, chewing and waiting[Pg 204] on events. He was the laziest of the whole crowd employed on the fishery, and since his return from death he seemed to take everything as a fatalist. \\n\\n \\n\\n But he had refused to join in the attack on Floyd. \\n\\n \\n\\n Schumer undid his bonds, and he stood up, stretched himself, grunted, and walked off to join the others. \\n\\n \\n\\n Schumer looked after him. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He\u0027s a cool customer. Well, there\u0027s an end of the business. To-morrow they will all be working again, except the dead men. Now let\u0027s get back and bury Sru. We\u0027ll have to hunt for him in the grove. Then you can come on board and we will have something to eat. You haven\u0027t had breakfast?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Lord, no!\" replied Floyd. \"I had a sort of supper some time in the night, but what I want most is sleep. I\u0027ll lie down and have a snooze when we have finished up with Sru.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n They came back to the house, and then started out to find what the grove had to reveal to them. \\n\\n \\n\\n The cache had been half rifled, but most of the goods that had been taken were still lying on the sands and had not been injured. \\n\\n \\n\\n Then they found Sru lying at the foot of an artus tree, a broken spear in his hand. He was lying on his face, and he would not trouble them any more. \\n\\n \\n\\n Schumer buried him after a fashion of his own. He ordered two of the crew to carry the deceased to the pierhead at the break in the reef and cast him to the sharks. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"They\u0027ll look after him,\" said he. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1823/52925.html","bookId":1024,"book":{"id":1024,"title":"The Pearl Fishers","description":"ç®€ä»‹ï¼š The sun was breaking above the sea line, and the Pacific, heaving to the swell, lay all to the eastward in meadows of gold....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1823","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:09 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:09 AM"}}
