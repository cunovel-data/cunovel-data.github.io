{"id":12463,"no":6,"title":"CHAPTER VI RISK OF WAR","content":"\"You can\u0027t get pearls from oysters till the oysters are rotten,\" said Schumer next morning, as they sat after breakfast consulting on the day\u0027s work. \"Of course, you could take every individual fresh oyster and hunt under its beard; but you know how an oyster sticks to its shell even after it is opened, and you can fancy the work it would be. Once they are decayed they are mushy, and the work is easy though it\u0027s not pleasant. But it\u0027s surprising how quick you get used to it. We worked pretty hard yesterday, and I propose to take it easy this morning, and then a bit later on I want to have a regular overhaul of the saloon and trade room of the old Tonga. We have cleared the way pretty well, but I\u0027ve been so busy catching stores in the bush that I\u0027ve never had time for an overhaul. You see there was only Isbel and me to do the job. I expect the oysters we laid out yesterday will be fit to work on to-morrow.\" \n \n \"You\u0027ve done this pearl business before,\" said Floyd. \n \n Schumer laughed. \n \n \"I have helped in pearling, if that\u0027s what you mean, but I have never had any luck. I once had my hand on a fortune in pearls, but it did not come off. \n \n [Pg 54]\"There was a French island in these seas, no matter where—it wasn\u0027t a thousand miles from the Marquesas. It was a double lagoon island, shaped like an hourglass; no use to look at, not enough trees to give any amount of copra. It had done a little business in sandalwood in the old days, but that was all gone. But the place wasn\u0027t deserted. There was an old Frenchman in charge; he had rented it under the French government, and he lived there with his two sons, and seemed happy enough, though doing next to no trade. \n \n \"I was in the outer lagoon twice as supercargo of a trading schooner; once we put in for water, and the second time we called on the chance of picking up a little copra. Lefarge was the old man\u0027s name, and he was a great fisherman; said he lived there mostly for the fishing and to have an easy life. \n \n \"Yet somehow he struck me as a man who would not be content to spend his time fishing and sitting in the sun, and his two boys struck me the same. \n \n \"When I wanted to explore the island and get round by the reef to the main lagoon he said that was forbidden, the natives held it taboo to white men, and so on. \n \n \"Then I began to suspect, and the only one thing I could suspect was shell, and maybe pearls. \n \n \"The more I thought of it the more sure I was; but, of course, I could do nothing; the place was his, and whatever it held, and we were peaceful traders, not pirates. So, when we had loaded with all the copra he could give us, out we put, wishing him good health and good luck in his fishing. \n \n \"Two days from the island we met a mail brigantine, and she signaled us that war had been declared between France and Germany, and our captain—Max Schuster[Pg 55] was his name—began to swear, for we were bound for the Marquesas, which are French, and we\u0027d have to alter our course and lose consignments and trade, and he sat down on a mooring bit, and cursed war and the French till I took him by the arm and led him down the saloon and explained what was in my mind. \n \n \"I told him of my suspicions about the island, and he pricked up his ears. Then, when I had been talking to him about ten minutes and explaining and arguing, he suddenly took fire. \n \n \"It\u0027s surprising how a dull man will refuse to be convinced—won\u0027t see, till all at once, when he does see, he\u0027ll rush at what you show him harder than the best. \n \n \"Schuster, when he saw fully the advantage of his position, little risk, and everything to gain, rushed up on deck. In less than five minutes the schooner was showing her tail to the Marquesas and making a long board for the island. \n \n \"Our crew were mostly Swedes, Kanakas, and an Irishman, and when they heard the news that Schuster had to tell them they were his to a man. The French were not much in favor just then; they had Noumea tacked on to their name, and the ordinary sailor loves a bit of a fight or any break in the monotony of sea life. We had plenty of trade rifles, Albinis—not the best sort of rifle, but good enough for us—and plenty of ammunition. \n \n \"We lifted the island at dawn on the second day, and were anchored in the lagoon a few hours later. \n \n \"Old Lefarge was on the beach tinkering a canoe. He didn\u0027t seem surprised to see us come in with the German flag flying at the peak, nor did his sons, who came out of the frame house set back among the bushes.[Pg 56] They thought we had sickness or something on board, for they made no offer to put out to us. We lowered a boat on the port side, which was the side away from the beach, and got our men in and the rifles, and then rowed ashore. \n \n \"When they saw us landing they took fright, but our men covered them with their rifles, and Schuster and I came up to the old man and his sons and told them that war was declared, and that they were prisoners. \n \n \"They could do nothing, and they just gave in. We had them taken on board the schooner, and then we went to the frame house, and there, sure enough, in a big safe, were the pearls. We had searched the prisoners and taken their keys from them. The key of the safe was among them, and we opened it easily. There were twenty thousand pounds\u0027 worth of pearls, so we judged. \n \n \"Schuster was a man who always held tight by the law. I pointed out to him that since we were at war with France all French property belonged to us by rights, and that the best thing we could do was to land the prisoners and take the pearls. We did not want prisoners. I pointed out to him, also, that we were acting in the nature of privateers, but without a letter of marque, and that consequently our prize would go to the government, and we would get nothing. \n \n \"I pointed out that since this was French property it would be much better just to take it and be thankful, and say nothing. He said that would be piracy.\" \n \n \"So it would,\" said Floyd. \n \n \"Well, maybe it would; but what is war if not piracy legalized? You have a letter of marque and you are a privateer, you have none and you are a pirate.\" \n \n [Pg 57]\"But even privateering has ceased,\" objected Floyd. \n \n \"Well,\" said Schumer, \"if it has it ought to be renewed in war time; it breeds fine men, as you English ought to know, and it\u0027s every bit as legitimate as fighting behind naval guns. However, Schuster thought different about our case. He said he would take the whole lot, prisoners and pearls, to the nearest German island, and claim a share of the proceeds, and be within the law. \n \n \"So off we set, and it took us nearly three weeks to reach the island we were in search of, between head winds and calms. When we got there it was getting on for night, so we held off and on till morning, and when the pilot came aboard we gave him news of the war, and several canoes that had put out shot back to land with it; so that when we entered the harbor the place was decked with flags, and we were cheered right from the harbor mouth to the quay.\" \n \n Schumer paused for a light, and went on: \n \n \"We landed our prisoners and the pearls, and the governor had laid a big spread for us, baked pig and lager beer, and so on, and Schuster was in the middle of a speech when the sound of a gun brought us all out on the beach, and there, entering the harbor, was the German cruiser of the station. \n \n \"The captain landed and asked us what we were doing with the flags, and when we explained he told us that there was no war, only a lying rumor. He had the latest European news from San Francisco, and he gave it to us. \n \n \"It was worth going through the whole of that business to see Schuster\u0027s face. He said nothing, and the governor said nothing, and it was fortunate they held[Pg 58] their tongues, for the cruiser only waited four hours to water and put off again. \n \n \"When she had gone the governor bundled old Lefarge and his sons on board our schooner and the pearls, and he gave us orders to take them back to their island and dump them there, and he sent an armed guard to see that it was done. He judged, and judged rightly, that Lefarge would make no trouble afterward, simply because he would not want to advertise the existence of his island. He made them a present of a few cases of California champagne and some cigars, and old Lefarge was so glad to be out of the business and get back his pearls that he insisted on opening the champagne, and Schuster brought out some trade gin, and they all got drunk. \n \n \"There was a big moon that night, and they enjoyed themselves, Lefarge singing \u0027Deutschland, Deutschland über alles,\u0027 and the governor the \u0027Marseillaise.\u0027 \n \n \"Then they started fighting, and then they got sick. \n \n \"Men are strange things, once they let themselves go, and they are all pretty much alike when they are drunk.\" \n \n \"You took them back to their island?\" said Floyd. \n \n \"Yes, and then we had to return and bring back the armed guard. Schuster lost nearly two months over the business, to say nothing of the provisions and loss of trade. He said he wanted to sink the mail brigantine that had given us the lie; but you can\u0027t sink a ship by wanting to. Well, let\u0027s get to work.\" \n \n They rose up and crossed the coral to the wreck. She was lying at a slant that made it just possible to walk her decks without holding on to anything; her copper was already dull green, and the barnacles, long[Pg 59] dead, showed up like bosses on the copper green like it, as though the verdigris had invaded them. The sun had boiled out the pitch of the planking, and the decks were warping, the planks bursting up from the dowels. \n \n The great \"dunch\" she had received from the coral in beaching had shaken everything loose; the bowsprit had sprung up from the knightheads; all forward of the great breach in her side the planking was loosened from the ribs, and only wanted another storm to break away and give the sea a clean sweep of the interior of the hull. \n \n But leaving aside the ravages of the sea, the work of ruin was going steadily on under the influence of weather and sun. A ship out of water is dead, and death means corruption. On the reefs and beaches of the ocean you will see wrecks, carcasses of ships, skeletons with the blue sky showing through their ribs. They have been eaten by the weather more than by the sea. \n \n They reached the deck of the Tonga, and made their way down the companionway to the main cabin. \n \n There was plenty of light through the broken sides of the vessel, and the sunshine from the outside world showed up the interior and was reflected by the varnished pine paneling and by a strip of mirror still absolutely intact. The table in the center was still standing, and above it the swinging lamp all askew, an empty bird cage lay in one corner, and all sorts of raffle littered the floor. \n \n The captain and chief mate\u0027s cabin lay aft, and Schumer, opening the doors and fixing them so, began a thorough overhaul of the contents. He had already salved the ship\u0027s money and papers, the nautical instru[Pg 60]ments, charts, and books; what remained was mostly private property, and there was not very much of it. Some clothes, underwear, and boots and shoes made up the pile, together with native curios, cheap novels, some writing materials, and two revolvers with ammunition. \n \n \"It\u0027ll all come in handy some time or another,\" said Schumer, \"and I propose that we stuff the lot back into the old man\u0027s cabin; they\u0027ll be as safe there as anywhere, unless another big storm comes and makes a clean sweep of everything. Now let\u0027s have another go at the cargo.\" \n \n They had no need to enter the hold by the main hatch. The damaged side gave them ample means of entry. The confusion was appalling. \n \n Schumer had already salved a quantity of canned stuff. Unable to move the boxes and crates, he had broken them open with an ax and removed the contents piecemeal; but, having only Isbel to help, and no very urgent incentive to the work, he had done comparatively little. Now, with the prospect of remaining on the island and the necessity of feeding possible labor when the time came for working the lagoon, it was a different matter. \n \n Floyd, however, did not see it in the same light as Schumer, and when, after an hour\u0027s work carrying stuff across the coral, they knocked off for a rest, he put his ideas before the other. \n \n \"Look here,\" said he, \"it\u0027s all very well breaking our backs over this business, but we haven\u0027t got the labor to feed yet; we\u0027ll have to go to Sydney or \u0027Frisco to get the money raised, and it may be six months after we are taken from here before we can get back, maybe longer.[Pg 61] Then the chap that finances this business will do the provisioning of the expedition. I don\u0027t see the point in harvesting this stuff under the trees, especially as it\u0027s safe enough in the wreck.\" \n \n \"Now, see here,\" said Schumer, \"if you are not prepared for everything in this world you never get anywhere. You say the stuff is safe enough on the wreck; I say it isn\u0027t. First, there\u0027s the heat of the sun, which doesn\u0027t improve it. Secondly, there\u0027s the chance of a hurricane making a clean sweep of everything. The tail end of a big storm landed her where she is; the front end of another may finish her. You say that it may take us six months or more before we can start on our business—who knows? Who knows that a likely ship may not call here with some man in charge of her who would join us in the venture? I would sooner have a decent shipowner in it than some American or Australian financier. You never know what may occur, and here is a lot of stuff that may save the situation when the time comes. No, we have got to get it safe, and get it safe we will, not only provisions, but as much of the trade as we can manage. It\u0027s all money, and you can do nothing without money, either in these seas or in Europe. So we\u0027ll just stick to this business, and we\u0027ll cover the cached lots over with sailcloth—we have lots of that. We had better stick to it for a week right on and get it over. I\u0027ve been thinking about it ever since this morning, and something tells me that we\u0027d be fools to bother about the lagoon, which is safe as a bank, while the stuff that will help to raid that bank is in danger.\" \n \n \"Suppose there are no pearls in those oysters of any account?\" \n \n [Pg 62]\"There\u0027s always the shell,\" replied Schumer, \"and there are sure to be pearls. You are of the disbelieving sort.\" \n \n \"Not a bit—only—well, perhaps you are right. I\u0027m not going to shirk any work that may be useful—and when do you propose to examine those oysters we fetched up yesterday?\" \n \n \"I\u0027ll leave them a week,\" said Schumer; \"the longer they are left the more rotten they\u0027ll be, and the easier to work. Besides, if we found no pearls, it would take the heart out of us, and, more than that, the hope of finding pearls when we do go will put the heart into us. Nothing is better to make one work than a pleasant prospect not quite assured in front of one. It\u0027s the gambling instinct—a big instinct.\" \n \n Floyd laughed. There was something about the man Schumer that held him more and more and compelled belief and the admiration that all men have for strength and foresight. Schumer did a lot of thinking as well as working. He had said nothing up to this moment of abandoning the oyster business for a week and putting all their energies into the salving of provisions and trade—he had been thinking out the whole plan in silence. He disliked the labor of the salvage business as much as Floyd, but he imposed it on himself as means to a distant end, and Floyd, though he did not see the end in the same light as his companion, was not the man to hold back when another was working. \n \n \"I am with you,\" said he. \"It will give us exercise, anyhow, and it\u0027s better than diving. Come on and let\u0027s get at it.\" \n \n He revenged himself by outvying Schumer in energy. They worked stripped to the waist. \n \n [Pg 63]They had set themselves a herculean task. It was not only a question of conveying small goods piecemeal in extemporized baskets; it was a business also of carrying heavy stuff, bolts of cotton, and so forth that could not be divided up. \n \n There was not only the conveying to be done, but the storing. In this nature helped them. The reef, or, rather, the island that formed this part of the atoll had a big sink in it amid the grove at the back of their encampment. Schumer thought that in ancient days natives must have made this hollow by artificial means for some reason or other, possibly as a big rain pond, though that supposition seemed negatived by the existence of the natural well that lay in the western border of the grove. However, it had been formed there. It was almost a pit, a hundred yards long, shelving toward the ends and densely protected by trees to seaward. Schumer calculated that owing to this density of vegetation and the fact of the ends having drainage into the lagoon, this trench would not fill up, let the rain come heavy as it might. On the fact that the waves from the heaviest sea could not reach it he was assured by the configuration of the outside reef. \n \n He had fixed on a week\u0027s work, and at the end of that time, though they had done much, they had not done all; still, he seemed satisfied, as well he might be. \n \n They had cached all the provisions, they had salved a fair portion of the perishable trade, and covered this portion of the salvage with sailcloth, and of all their work this was the most laborious and trying. They had removed the rifles, fifty in number, from their cases, and stored them with the ammunition in a separate cache; they had four navy revolvers of the Colt type,[Pg 64] and these with the ammunition for them they kept in the tent. Last, but not least, there was the liquor—cases of trade gin, and a few cases of wine. \n \n Schumer did not bother to cache these—he dealt with them in another fashion. \n \n \"It\u0027s waste of money,\" said he, \"but I have been thinking it out. This square face is no use to man or brute; it\u0027s only good to sell, and we have no customers for it, and don\u0027t want them. It\u0027s dangerous stuff to have about. The wine is different; there\u0027s not much of it, and it may turn in useful, but the gin has to go.\" \n \n He opened the cases, and they smashed the bottles, heaving them on to the raw coral beyond the wreck, so that the glass might not be in the way. The air stank with the fumes of the filthy stuff while the smashing went on. Isbel helped, the instinct for destruction that lies in human nature, and especially in children, seemed to have wakened up in her to its full. \n \n She laughed over the work. Floyd had never seen her laugh before, and as he looked at her shining eyes and flashing teeth it seemed to him that despite all the labors of the missionary here was an atom of fighting and destructive force, useful for good or evil, and only waiting on events for its development. \n \n \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1823/52908.html","bookId":1024,"book":{"id":1024,"title":"The Pearl Fishers","description":"简介： The sun was breaking above the sea line, and the Pacific, heaving to the swell, lay all to the eastward in meadows of gold....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1823","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:09 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:09 AM"}}
