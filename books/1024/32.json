Floyd and Isbel did not accompany him. He was going to interview Hakluyt, and he judged that he would do the business better if he did it alone. \\n\\n \\n\\n He waved his hand to them as he rowed off, and when he reached the quay he made straight for Hakluyt\u0027s office. \\n\\n \\n\\n Hakluyt was in, but was engaged, and Cardon waited in an outer room patiently enough for some twenty minutes. He was in no hurry, and when at last he was shown into the room where the shipowner was seated at his desk he showed no hurry to begin the business he had on hand. \\n\\n \\n\\n He was studying Hakluyt. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well, sir,\" said Hakluyt, after the pause that followed Cardon\u0027s announcement and while that person was comfortably taking his seat, \"and what can I do for you?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Nothing,\" said Cardon. \"I have come to tell you that Luckman has burned the Southern Cross, according to arrangement with you, and that I have all the evidence in my pocket, that he tried to do away with Mr. Floyd according to agreement, and that I have witnesses of the plot. In other words, my dear man, that your game is up and that it rests entirely with me whether I close my fist on you or let you go free.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Hakluyt said nothing. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"All your pearls are gone,\" said Cardon, lighting a[Pg 302] cigarette. \"Floyd has got them. They are worth a good many thousand. I have taken your schooner, the Domain, and you have here and now to make out a paper selling her to me for the sum of—shall we say five thousand?—not one penny of which you will ever receive. I am going to take her to \u0027Frisco, and if you make one kick or give one squeal or try one dirty trick I will put you in quod as sure as my name is Jack Cardon.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"This is blackmail,\" said Hakluyt, sweating and grinning at the same time, and in all his life Cardon had never seen anything stranger than that grin. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"This is blackmail!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Of course it is,\" replied the other, \"but what I want to point out to you is that there is no resistance. You are absolutely tied up. I have Luckman and Schumer in the hollow, of my hand, a whole island full of Kanaka witnesses, and the sunken schooner; also Floyd and a native girl. Well, what do you say?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Where is Schumer?\" cried Hakluyt, who seemed now like a person dazed by a blow. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He\u0027s with Luckman, and I can only say this—he can be produced when wanted.\" Then, suddenly bursting out: \"He is where you sent him. Dead in the fo\u0027c\u0027sle of the ship that he sank. He, and Luckman along with him. Blackmail! Do you think if I were working this thing for my own hand I would stoop to blackmail you? No, sir. I\u0027m working this for Floyd, who is a soft-shell Englishman, as good as they make them, but a child against ruffians of your cut. I\u0027m squeezing you for him, and if you don\u0027t like[Pg 303] my loving embrace say so and I\u0027ll call in the law to do the business. Now I give you one minute to decide. Do you stick out or do you give in?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I give in,\" said Hakluyt. \\n\\n \\n\\n The End \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1823/52934.html","bookId":1024,"book":{"id":1024,"title":"The Pearl Fishers","description":"简介： The sun was breaking above the sea line, and the Pacific, heaving to the swell, lay all to the eastward in meadows of gold....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1823","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:09 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:09 AM"}}
