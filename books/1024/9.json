{"id":12466,"no":9,"title":"CHAPTER IX A WEEK\u0027S WORK","content":"Next day, though the sea still held, the wind had fallen completely, and the lagoon, protected by the reef, was calm, though heaving slightly to the impetus from without. All the water close to the reef opening was wreck strewn, a section of deck floated like a raft, and they had to exercise care in navigating the boat. \"If we had hands enough,\" said Schumer, \"all that stuff might come in useful to build a house with, or some sort of shanty that would give more protection than the tent. We\u0027ll want something in the rainy season. But there is no use in bothering, we haven\u0027t the hands.\" When they arrived at the fishing ground they landed and found the heap of shells they had left scattered and almost vanished. \"That will teach us in future,\" said Schumer. \"We must find some means of protecting the stuff in case of storms; those old rain pools would do if we could only drain them, but we can\u0027t without labor. It\u0027s always want of labor that has stopped us. Well, we\u0027ll get it some day.\" Though no real business could be done on the fishery[Pg 78] till more help was obtainable, the temptation to work was irresistible. Those first pearls were always in their minds. It was humanly impossible to rest content with that sample, and refrain from the attempt to get more, even in face of the exhausting labor of diving and dredging. But they worked less ambitiously now, and so carefully that the day\u0027s take of shell did not amount to half the take on the first day. As a result they were fresh when they knocked off, instead of being worn out. They left the oysters to rot, and so it went on day by day, till at the end of the week they knocked off the diving one evening and contemplated their handiwork. Each day\u0027s take had been placed separately, and the first day\u0027s was now \"ripe,\" to use Schumer\u0027s expression. \"We\u0027ll start on it to-morrow,\" said he, \"and go through it slowly so that there may be no chance of anything escaping; the dredge wants mending, too—we\u0027d better do that to-night after supper. Isbel can make another pocket for it. I wish we had diving dresses and an air pump, and when we get the business properly fixed we may be able to obtain them; but there\u0027s no use in thinking of that now.\" They got into the boat, and Floyd sculled her back, Schumer sitting in the stern and conning them clear of the floating wreckage near the camping place. It grieved Schumer\u0027s heart to see all that stuff waste and ungetable. He was one of the men who can make use of anything almost to further or maintain his set purpose.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1823/52911.html","bookId":1024,"book":{"id":1024,"title":"The Pearl Fishers","description":"简介： The sun was breaking above the sea line, and the Pacific, heaving to the swell, lay all to the eastward in meadows of gold....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1823","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:09 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:09 AM"}}
