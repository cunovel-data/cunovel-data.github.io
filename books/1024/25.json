{"id":12482,"no":25,"title":"CHAPTER XXV ORDERED TO SYDNEY","content":"Next morning Schumer took Floyd aside. \"Hakluyt is well pleased with the work here,\" said he. \"He thinks the prospects even better than I made them out to him, and now he wants to go back.\" \"Does he?\" said Floyd. The news came as a pleasant surprise. \"Yes, he has got his business in Sydney to attend to and he\u0027s keen on getting back at once. Of course he goes in the Southern Cross, but he can\u0027t go alone, for the schooner has to be brought back.\" \"To be sure.\" \"You must go with him,\" said Schumer. \"There is no one else for the job.\" \"I!\" exclaimed Floyd. \"Yes, there is no one else. I have been away too long. In fact I only got back in time to save the situation. You are a very good fellow, Floyd, but you aren\u0027t much use for working natives. It\u0027s not your business in life; it is mine.\" \"But see here,\" said the other, \"why can\u0027t Hakluyt send the schooner back with another man in charge? There are lots of men in Sydney who could do the job.\" \"Yes, and what would that mean? Letting another[Pg 210] man into our secrets. Surely you are not against doing your share of the work.\" \"I!\" cried Floyd, flushing. \"Have I ever refused to do all in my power to help? Of course I will go. Only, the thing has come on me as a surprise, and, I will say it frankly, an unpleasant surprise. You say Hakluyt wants to go back at once. Well, I think you might have told me of it some days ago. You must have known all along.\" \"I did not,\" said Schumer. \"Of course I knew he wanted to go, but I did not know he wanted to go so soon. What does it matter? You have no preparations to make.\" \"How about the navigating on the way back?\" asked Floyd, ignoring the last remark. \"You had Hakluyt to help you coming, but if I am to come back single-handed it seems to me I will be in a bad way.\" \"You will have Mountain Joe,\" replied Schumer. \"I have given special attention to that gentleman\u0027s education on the voyage to Sydney and back. You remember he could work out a dead reckoning even when I took him in hand. He was absolutely useless by himself, but under guidance he could be quite useful. Well, he knows a lot more now, and if I could get to Sydney with him as he was then, you can surely get back from Sydney with him as he is now.\" \"Oh, I suppose that will be all right,\" said Floyd. \"And what am I to do in Sydney besides dumping Hakluyt there?\" \"You will unlade the shell which I am sending and take in some more provisions. The Southern Cross wants an overhaul—that will take a week or ten days—she wants some new spars and a few barnacles[Pg 211] scraped off her. We want a big lot of canned stuff, vegetables, and bully beef. I\u0027ll talk to you to-night about that. Hakluyt is in the way of getting it cheaper than we could if we were working alone.\" \"How long do you think we will have to stay in Sydney?\" \"Oh, about three weeks or so.\" \"It will be over two months before I can get back.\" \"About that.\" \"And when exactly do you want me to start?\" \"Oh, in a couple of days. It will take us that to get the shell aboard. I am going to start on the work this morning. I\u0027ll get all the hands on it, crew and fishermen both. We can get the stuff on board on the raft and with the help of the whaleboat.\" \"Very well,\" said Floyd, \"I\u0027ll go.\" He turned away and walked along the lagoon edge. Always when Fortune turned toward him she had something unpleasant to add to her gifts. The pink pearl had been followed by the running away of Isbel, and the great white pearl by the mutiny of the hands. Isbel had been given to him only yesterday, and now he had to leave her. Since yesterday he had lived in a state of extraordinary happiness. Wonderland. To love and to find that you are loved. There is nothing else. No dream can come near this reality. And now he had to leave her. He crossed the reef, and stood looking out to sea. The Pacific lay blazing beneath the morning light, blue beyond the sun dazzle and heaving shoreward to burst in foam at his feet. The breeze came fresh across it, vivid and full of life. Floyd loved the sea. [Pg 212]It had become part of his nature and part of his being. It was his second mother. But to-day he was looking at it with fresh eyes. It was no longer the sea; it was separation from all he cared for and all he loved. He would have to leave Isbel and leave her with Schumer. When he had landed on the island first, Schumer had impressed him favorably, but little by little and by that slow process through which a complex and illusive personality makes its quality known to a simple and straightforward mind, he had come to the point of distrust as regards Schumer. He had no fear at all that Schumer would harm Isbel. Isbel was a person who could well take care of herself, and Schumer, he distinctly felt, was not a man dangerous to women. The instinctive feeling of danger had to do with himself. He was a fifth wheel in Schumer\u0027s chariot, an absorber of profits, and though he refused the thought that Schumer might attempt to get rid of him, he could not refuse the instinct. He felt suddenly surrounded by an atmosphere of danger none the less disturbing from the fact that he could not tell from what point it arose. He disliked this journey to Sydney, and he disliked Hakluyt even more. Brave as any man could be, he feared for his own safety, not for his own sake, but for the sake of Isbel. Should anything happen to him what would become of her? And there was nothing he could do. He was completely in the grasp of events. He could not refuse to perform this obvious duty that had suddenly been laid down before him by Schumer. He could not take[Pg 213] Isbel with him, and he could not take any precautions as to his own safety beyond simple watchfulness. He turned back from the sea, and as he turned he saw Isbel. She was standing at the edge of the grove, and the trees quite sheltered them from the sight of the people by the house. He came toward her, and they entered the grove together. Close to the sea edge of the grove a huge tree had fallen. Rotten with age, it had crashed its way through the lesser trees and lay like a dead giant over which the undergrowth had cast its green skirts in part. They sat down upon it, and Isbel, nestling up close beside him, rested her head upon his shoulder. Then he told her that he was going. Told her the whole thing and the reasons that held him. Told her that the separation would only be for a little while, and surely, surely he would come back, and as he talked and explained he felt her shudder as a person shudders from the cold.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1823/52927.html","bookId":1024,"book":{"id":1024,"title":"The Pearl Fishers","description":"简介： The sun was breaking above the sea line, and the Pacific, heaving to the swell, lay all to the eastward in meadows of gold....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1823","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:09 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:09 AM"}}
