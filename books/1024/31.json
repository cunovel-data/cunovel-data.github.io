{"id":12488,"no":31,"title":"CHAPTER XXXI THE ISLAND","content":"Next morning early, Floyd was on deck and aloft with a glass. He knew it was impossible, at their rate of sailing, that the island could show up before noon. They might not even sight it before sundown. Yet, all the same, he was on the lookout. There was nothing; nothing but the great wheel of the sea. Not even a gull showed in the whole of that blue expanse. He came down, disappointed, and was gloomy and absent-minded at breakfast, though Cardon was cheerful enough. Toward eleven o\u0027clock, when they were on deck smoking and talking, a great bird passed them, flying straight ahead. \"That chap is going twenty knots,\" said Cardon. \"I reckon he could make forty if he wanted to. He\u0027s not much of an indication that there\u0027s land about, for a thousand miles to him is less than a thirty-mile walk to you or me. Say, Floyd, how would it be if we couldn\u0027t find your island? I heard a yarn once of a chap who spotted a guano island. He said it was a solid slab of guano a mile wide, and he started for \u0027Frisco and got up a syndicate to work it, and they chartered a schooner and had a champagne breakfast[Pg 268] to start on; and when they reached the spot, the darned thing had gone—sunk into the sea.\" \"Rubbish!\" said Floyd. \"And I wish you wouldn\u0027t start those sorts of yarns just now; it\u0027s not lucky.\" \"Oh, I am only joking. Your island is there, safe enough, with Schumer on top of it. That sort of chap never sinks into the sea; it\u0027s only the good men Davy Jones troubles about. He\u0027s a mascot, sure.\" Floyd did not answer him; he was staring right ahead. \"When I sighted it first,\" said he, \"I was in an open boat that gave very little horizon, and what struck me first was the sky. It was pale, just a patch of it, a sort of glittering paleness that was caused by the lagoon. Have you ever seen that mark in the sky above a lagoon island?\" \"Can\u0027t say I have, but then I\u0027m not so used to the Pacific as you are. Do you see anything now?\" \"No,\" said Floyd. \"I wish I did.\" Cardon whistled gently to himself, tapping the ashes out of his pipe against the rail and refilling it. He was just as anxious as Floyd, but his anxiety had not such a keen edge and he hid it better. There were times when he, like Floyd, almost doubted the reality of the island. He was bending in the shelter of the bulwark to light his pipe when a hail came from aloft. Floyd had stationed a lookout in the crosstrees, and it was his voice that came, high and clear, like the call of a bird. Next moment the two men were swarming up the ratlines and looking forward in the direction to which the fellow was pointing. [Pg 269]\"It\u0027s the island!\" said Floyd. Cardon looked. All he could see at first was a tiny mark on the sea line, a mark no larger than a pin head; then, as his eyes grew more accustomed to the dazzle, another tiny mark appeared close to the first, and then another. Then these marks became fused together, forming a faint line. The lookout had a glass with him, and Floyd, taking it, found that it gave scarcely any better definition than the naked eye. The shimmer of the sea formed a veil more impenetrable than the veil of distance. He handed the glass to Cardon, who was clinging to the ratlines below him. \"It\u0027s land, sure enough,\" said Cardon, \"and another hour will bring it right up. We\u0027d better go down and wait on deck; no use sticking here.\" In less than an hour the palm tops showed clearly through the glass, and in two hours\u0027 time the reef could be made out and the white thread of the foam breaking upon it. It was the island, surely enough, though still a great way off—so far that from the deck and with the naked eye nothing could be seen but a faint smudge that might have been a trace of smoke clinging to the sea line. The wind had fallen a bit, and now, as if beneath the weight of afternoon, it was falling still more. Floyd hove the log. They were making seven knots, and he calculated that it would be sundown before they could make the break in the reef. Dinner was served, but they could scarcely eat; the[Pg 270] weather held all their thoughts, and the dread of the wind falling to a flat calm was on both their minds. At four o\u0027clock, however, the wind was still steady, and the land ahead was visible now clearly from the deck. Floyd, who had gone aloft, suddenly hailed Cardon, who was on deck, and the latter came up to him. \"Look out and tell me what you see,\" said Floyd, handing him the glass he had been using. Cardon looked through the glass. \"By gad,\" said he, \"there\u0027s a vessel in the lagoon.\" The glass showed the reef and the grove on the right of the break distinctly. The break in the reef was not so clear, as they were heading slightly to the south of it; but very clearly indeed could be seen the threadlike masts of a vessel anchored in the lagoon. She was stripped of canvas. She was a schooner. Cardon handed the glass up again to Floyd, who took another long look; then the two men came down on deck. \"That\u0027s Luckman!\" said Floyd. \"\u0027Pears so,\" said Cardon, \"unless it\u0027s some vessel blown in by chance.\" \"No, it\u0027s no chance. I feel convinced of that. He started ahead of us, and maybe laid over us in sailing. Let\u0027s go down below and have a talk over this.\" They went down to the cabin, and Floyd took his seat at the table while Cardon took the couch. \"You see, it explains everything,\" said Floyd. \"Explains why Luckman did not sail with us, and why Hakluyt looked so cheerful, which he wouldn\u0027t have done had his plans fallen through.\" \"If what you say is right,\" said Cardon, \"it makes[Pg 271] everything a lot worse, for why should these scoundrels employ two ships unless they are determined to lose one of them? You may bet the Southern Cross is insured to the hilt and over. You say Hakluyt had her into dry dock and spent money having her scraped when she did not want it. That was all part of the plan to allay suspicion, for what would the ordinary fool say but that a man wouldn\u0027t spend money like that on a ship he was going to lose.\" \"Besides,\" said Floyd, \"if Hakluyt had sent Luckman with me, what reason could he have given me for sending him? We don\u0027t want another white man in this business—well, what excuse could Hakluyt have given me for shoving Luckman in?\" \"None,\" said Cardon, \"that I can see; but that\u0027s not saying a clever rascal like Hakluyt couldn\u0027t have found some excuse.\" Floyd suddenly struck the table with his fist. \"The Domain wasn\u0027t at her anchorage when we left,\" said he. \"I noticed it, but I never thought of it as being connected with us.\" \"The Domain? What vessel was she?\" \"One of Hakluyt\u0027s, a schooner. She was pointed out to me as belonging to him, and before we started I noticed that she wasn\u0027t at her anchorage. I thought nothing of that, for a shipowner doesn\u0027t keep ships to anchor them out and leave them to rot. But there\u0027s the fact, and I\u0027ll bet my life that schooner in the lagoon is the Domain.\" \"You\u0027re probably right,\" said Cardon. \"Anyhow, we\u0027ll soon see. Now let\u0027s talk of my share in the business. If Luckman is really here, it means that[Pg 272] your destruction has been plotted and planned to the last tip end. It means that there must be no quarter for Schumer.\" \"If Luckman is here,\" said Floyd, rising and pacing the cabin, \"Schumer will get no quarter from me. Not a ha\u0027porth of mercy.\" \"I\u0027m glad you are beginning to see things in their proper light,\" said Cardon. \"And now to business. I must keep hidden; I can stay in your cabin, and you must get these two fellows on board as quick as possible. It may be that Schumer will board us right away when we get into the lagoon. He\u0027s almost sure to. It may be that he will bring Luckman with him. Now I think the best plan, if Schumer boards us right off and by himself, is to deal with him at once, lock him up here, and then land and deal with Luckman.\" \"Maybe you are right,\" said Floyd. \"I\u0027m sure I am. There\u0027s nothing like grasping your nettle right off, and it will give them no time to conspire together. Of course, if they both come aboard, so much the better. You speak to them fair, and bring them down here, get them seated at the table before some drink; then I\u0027ll open the cabin door and enter, smiling. Directly you see me, draw your gun and cover one of them. Cover Luckman; that will be pleasanter for you, seeing that Schumer is known to you and was once your friend—or pretended to be. When we have disarmed them, we will tie them up.\" \"Suppose they succeed in drawing their pistols?\" \"In that case we must shoot first, and shoot to kill. There\u0027s no use in putting on kid gloves in this matter. Your life has been planned against; these two chaps[Pg 273] are out against you, and they\u0027ve got to be scotched. Do you feel equal to the job? If not, we had better \u0027bout ship and make back to Sydney.\" \"God help me,\" said Floyd, \"but what I would have shuddered at a few days ago leaves me now without the least feeling. It\u0027s finding Luckman here, I suppose, finding that the plot against me is absolutely true. I don\u0027t know. But the idea of killing those men seems no more to me than the idea of killing a pair of scorpions.\" \"That\u0027s right,\" said Cardon. \"You\u0027ll do all right. And now up with you on deck—I don\u0027t appear till the business begins. If I were to go on deck now, there\u0027s no knowing that I mightn\u0027t be spotted through a glass. Give me your fist.\" The two men shook hands. Then Floyd went on deck, where the hands were crowded forward, gazing at the island, which was now so close that the individual trees could be distinguished, the coral, and the surf breaking on the outer beach. Floyd\u0027s heart leaped in him at the sight. He took the glass from its sling near the wheel and examined the shore through it. Not a sign of life could be seen. The house was, of course, hidden by the grove, and it was quite unlikely that any one might be here on the seaward side of the reef; still, the absence of all signs of life struck a chill to the heart of Floyd, the illogical heart of the man who loves. The wind was still holding steady, and the Southern Cross was making good way. Now they were so close that he fancied he could[Pg 274] hear the tune of the surf on the coral; and now they were opening the break of the reef, and the lagoon showed mirror calm as compared to the sea. Floyd took the wheel. The schooner held for a moment on her course; then, answering to the helm, made full for the opening in the reef. The tide was with them, and like a white cloud the Southern Cross passed the pierheads of the reef and entered the lagoon. Floyd handed the wheel over to Mountain Joe, gave his orders to the fellows at the halyards and the braces, and walked forward. There was, indeed, another vessel in the lagoon, and she was the Domain. He could not be mistaken. She was anchored a good way out from the shore, and he maneuvered to get the inner berth. Even as he did so, his eye caught sight of a figure that had just emerged from the grove. It was Isbel. He ran to the bulwark rail and flung up his arm just as the roar of the anchor chain through the hawse pipe cut the air. Isbel waved her hand in reply. She was alone. Not a sign of Schumer or Luckman was to be seen, and Floyd, half mad with delight, started orders for the quarter boat to be lowered, and helped with his own hands at the falls. When the boat touched the beach he sprang out knee-deep in the water, waded ashore, and caught her two hands in his. Then he remembered the fellows in the boat and the possibility that Schumer might be watching from some post of observation. He released her hands and led the way up to the house. [Pg 275]\"Schumer?\" said he. \"Where is Schumer?\" Isbel nodded toward the fishing camp. \"Over there,\" said she; \"he and the new man. They will only know that you have come now. I saw you very far at sea, but I said nothing. I was to light a fire if I saw a ship, but I knew it was you, and I did nothing.\" They had entered the house, and were safe from observation. \"Isbel,\" said Floyd. He held her apart from him for a moment; then he caught her in his arms. She clung to him, holding him about the neck with her naked arms, telling him in a broken voice and a half whisper how she had waited and watched always for him; how she had prayed to the sea to bring him back, and the stars to light him on his way. Then holding him from her she told, in short, hot sentences, fierce as stabbing spears, of his danger. A new ship had come into the lagoon only the day before; a new man had joined Schumer, a terrible man. They had talked last night, and she had listened. No sooner had this strange man shown his face than she suspected danger; he \"carried danger with him.\" So she had listened. They had not talked in the house; they had gone together and sat by the grove edge. She had crawled through the trees and listened. At first she could not make out what they said, they spoke in so low a tone; then, feeling safe and forgetting caution, they spoke louder. Even still she could seize upon nothing definite, as they spoke in a general way as if about some prearranged plot, but she gathered enough to know that Luckman had[Pg 276] come to the island to wait for the man she loved, and then, with the help of Schumer, or, more properly speaking, the connivance of Schumer, to do away with him. As she told this her gaze seemed to turn inward, as though she were looking at some mental picture, and a long shudder ran through her as though from some vibration of the soul. It was not the shudder of fear or cold; it was the shudder of hate, and Floyd, who had never seen it before, felt for a moment almost afraid of Isbel. He recognized, and not for the first time, that this being whom he loved belonged to a world of which he knew little. She was a person from another star, the child of another race. In her love for him a whole unknown world was rushing to meet him. It was this that completed her fascination and made him, now heedless of Schumer\u0027s menace, seize her to his heart and cover her face and throat with burning kisses. Taking fire she returned them, and then, holding him apart from her again, and still speaking in those sentences, short and hot like stabbing spears that have already tasted blood, she went on to give him all that she had gathered and all that she suspected. She knew for certain that Luckman and Schumer were expecting Floyd, for they had mentioned him by name, and she knew for certain that they had designs upon the life of the man they were expecting, and here lay her great grief; she could not fathom the nature of their design. She had, however, gathered enough to understand that the Kanaka crew of the Southern Cross was to be brought ashore as soon as possible. \"Yes,\" said Floyd, \"they are going to do away with[Pg 277] the schooner. Well, we will see. We will see which of us is the cuter and which the stronger. Isbel, I am not alone.\" \"How?\" said Isbel, looking at him with wide-open eyes. \"I have a friend with me.\" \"A friend!\" \"Yes, a friend. Providence sent him, I think.\" He began to tell her about Cardon, how he had met him in the street in Sydney, how Cardon had joined in the venture and was ready to assist against Schumer, and how he was now on board the Southern Cross awaiting developments. He had reached this stage in his story when a sound from outside made them both turn. It was the sound of oars in rowlocks. Floyd sprang to the door. A boat that had crossed the lagoon from the fishing ground was within a few yards of the beach. It was the boat bringing Schumer from the fishing camp. A man was seated beside Schumer in the stern sheets. Was it Luckman? If indeed it was Luckman, then Luckman was a most formidable individual. This person seated beside Schumer was immense, a great four-square built man beside whom Schumer had the appearance of a youth. As the boat touched the sand Schumer leaped out, and, half wading, made up the beach toward Floyd, who had come down from the house. Isbel had remained indoors. \"So you\u0027re back,\" cried Schumer, as he held out his hand. \"I knew nothing till half an hour ago over[Pg 278] there at the fishing ground I turned my head and saw the Southern Cross coming into the lagoon. Isbel should have spotted her hours ago and given us a signal. Oh, I forgot. I have a new man to introduce you to, but you\u0027ve seen his vessel; it ran in here yesterday for water. It is the Domain, of Sydney, owned by—who do you think?—Hakluyt, and here\u0027s her captain; Luckman is his name. Luckman, this is Mr. Floyd.\" Just as Floyd held out his hand toward Luckman a curious sensation struck him, as though for a moment he were clairvoyant, as though for the hundredth part of a moment some glimpse had been given him of his psychic surroundings, a glimpse of the soul of Schumer, of Luckman, and incidentally of Hakluyt. It was Luckman\u0027s appearance, perhaps, that influenced him. Luckman, though a very big man at a distance, was a very little man seen close to. In other words, he had nothing to recommend him but his size. He had, no doubt, been all that the barkeeper had hinted. He had, no doubt, sunk ships in his time and lost the lives of innumerable sailormen and escaped from the law himself by a miracle. All the same, from the crown of his flat head to the sole of his flat feet, the man was a duffer, a mass of brute force—nothing more. And the thing that struck Floyd most keenly at that moment was the thought that Luckman, like himself, was in the toils of Schumer and Hakluyt; that Luckman might be used as a tool against him—Floyd—but would be inevitably flung away when used by Schumer and Hakluyt. That they would take the opportunity not only of getting rid of the Southern Cross[Pg 279] at a high insurance and of their troublesome partner, but also of Luckman, their tool and assistant. The fact that Schumer had taken Luckman to the fishing ground and let him see the secret of the island with his own eyes, that fact seemed to Floyd to be Luckman\u0027s death sentence. \"Glad to meet you,\" said Luckman, holding out a fist like a ham. \"It\u0027s funny that you should have turned up here,\" said Floyd, \"for only a very little time ago I parted with Mr. Hakluyt, your owner.\" \"Yes,\" said Luckman, \"it\u0027s funny enough to see two of Hakluyt\u0027s vessels in the same lagoon, considering the many lagoons there are in the Pacific. I was bound for Upolo, and was blown a bit out of my course, then I picked up this island and put in for water, and when Mr. Schumer here found Hakluyt was my owner he was surprised—weren\u0027t you, Mr. Schumer?\" He laughed as he asked the question, and Schumer laughed as he replied in the affirmative. \"The strange thing is,\" said Floyd gravely, \"that I left Sydney, came straight down here, and here I find the Domain, who has missed Upolo, which is a good way out of the line, been blown out of her course, and yet has arrived here only a day before me.\" \"And how is that strange?\" asked Luckman. \"In this way: I saw the Domain in Sydney harbor two days before I left, riding at her anchor. How the deuce has she managed to go through all those experiences you speak of and yet arrive here only the day before me?\" [Pg 280]\"And what date was it when you left Sydney?\" asked Luckman. Floyd gave the date. \"Well, all I can say,\" said Luckman, \"is that the Domain left ten days before that. You must be thinking of the Dominion, which is also owned by Hakluyt. She\u0027s a sister of the Domain, built on the same slip, owned by Shuster, she was, till he went bankrupt and Hakluyt picked her up for an old song. That\u0027s the vessel that\u0027s in your head. I left her anchored in Sydney harbor when I left.\" Floyd said nothing. Luckman\u0027s manner was so assured and plausible that had he not overheard that fatal conversation in Hakluyt\u0027s office he would have been entirely taken in. He turned to Schumer as if to change the subject. \"Well,\" said he, \"how has the luck been going?\" Schumer took him by the arm and led him away a bit along the water edge. \"I\u0027m glad you are back,\" said he, \"before that man Luckman leaves. It\u0027s a nuisance, his coming. Of course he\u0027s one of Hakluyt\u0027s men, else I\u0027d have made him clear out of the lagoon when he\u0027d taken his water on board. As it is he knows all about the pearling. He scented it at once, and spoke to me of it. You see, he\u0027s an old island hand, so I just told him, and, what\u0027s more, took him right over the grounds. I did a bit of trade with him, too. He had some timber and corrugated iron on board, and I bought it of him, and we\u0027ve been rafting it over all yesterday and to-day. I\u0027m going to put up huts over at the fishing camp. The rains will be here soon, now, and I want to get the fellows under cover.\" \"Oh, is that so?\" said Floyd. [Pg 281]He could not make out all this in the least, but he determined to say nothing and wait for more indications. \"Yes,\" said Schumer, \"it\u0027s most important for us to keep these fellows fit and well, and tents aren\u0027t much use against the rains, especially in an exposed place like the grounds over there. Seems like Providence, doesn\u0027t it, that fellow Luckman happening along with his building material just at the moment?\" \"Schumer,\" said Floyd, \"are you sure it\u0027s all right about Luckman?\" Schumer turned on him with a surprised look. \"Why, what could be wrong?\" \"Well, I could have sworn I saw the Domain in the harbor two days before I left.\" \"In Sydney harbor?\" \"Yes, in Sydney harbor.\" \"My dear chap,\" said Schumer, \"you heard what he said—what could be wrong? Even if Hakluyt were to try to get the better of us in any way what could Luckman do? Steal the pearls? Well, I reckon he\u0027d have his work cut out, considering we are two to one. No. You have made a mistake. It was the Dominion you saw. Mind you, I wouldn\u0027t trust Hakluyt farther than I could see him, but it\u0027s against common sense to think that he is trying to play any game against us. You see, the crew of the Domain are all Kanakas, and not fighting Kanakas, either, but a soft lot; otherwise it might be different. Then again Luckman is off to-morrow. Oh, you needn\u0027t be a bit scared of Luckman; I\u0027m sharp enough to smell a rat, as you very well know, and I\u0027m satisfied.\" \"Very well,\" said Floyd. [Pg 282]\"Now as to the building business,\" went on Schumer, \"I want all the Southern Cross chaps to get to work on it first thing to-morrow, so we may as well get them over to the fishing camp to-night.\" \"To-night!\" \"Yes, they\u0027ll be able to stretch their legs before setting to, and they\u0027ll want to put up tents for themselves while they are working.\" \"Very well. I can send them over in the whaleboat.\" \"That will do after supper,\" said Schumer. The sun at this moment was just setting beyond the reef, and a thin wreath of smoke was rising near the grove where Isbel was busy lighting the fire and getting supper ready. Luckman was seated on the sand, near the house, smoking and seemingly oblivious to everything but the beauty of the scene before him. The crew of the Southern Cross were fraternizing across the water with the crew of the Domain. Their thin, high-pitched voices came across the lagoon water and mixed with the crying of the gulls who were flocking around the vessels, picking up scraps from the rubbish that the fellows had hove overboard. Then, as the sun sank, the crying of the gulls died down and silence fell on the island with the night, a silence only broken by the song of the surf and the blowing of the night wind in the foliage of the grove. Isbel, having prepared the meal, had disappeared, and the three men found themselves alone by the flickering camp fire. It was the night before the new moon, and beyond the zone of firelight the lagoon showed all shot with stars, and the two schooners[Pg 283] gray black with their anchor lights shining in the twilight of the stars. Schumer had produced a bottle of wine in honor of Luckman, but despite the wine and Schumer\u0027s attempts at conviviality the talk hung fire. Floyd was thinking hard. Schumer\u0027s suggestion that the crew of the Southern Cross should be landed over at the fishing beach was plausible on the face of it. The men would work better after a night on shore; they would be on the spot in the morning, and so no time would be wasted bringing them across the lagoon, and it was certainly necessary that no time should be lost in putting up the huts, if they were to be put up, for the rainy season was fast approaching. All the same, he felt that there was more in the proposition than what met the eye. He did not like the idea of being left alone here with Schumer and Luckman. It was true that the crew of the Domain would be on board their vessel, but she was anchored a good way out. The conviction came to him that whatever these two men had in mind was to be carried out that night, and that the Southern Cross would be the object of their plans as well as himself. Most possibly they would sink her at her anchorage after having disposed of him. He determined, come what might, not to sleep ashore, and as they were finishing supper he made up his mind to state his intention at once. \"Well,\" said he, \"I suppose I\u0027d better get off and send those fellows across to the camp. I\u0027ll give them the whaleboat; it will hold the lot.\" \"Yes,\" said Schumer, \"I\u0027ll come with you and start[Pg 284] them off, and maybe you\u0027d better sleep on board for to-night, as I\u0027ve put Captain Luckman up in the house and there\u0027s only two beds.\" \"Yes, I\u0027ll sleep aboard,\" said Floyd, relieved, yet somewhat surprised at Schumer suggesting the very plan that was in his mind. \"I\u0027ve got all my tackle there, besides—well, shall we start?\" He looked round, on the chance of seeing Isbel, but she was nowhere about; then they left Luckman, smoking by the fire, and, going down to the lagoon edge, pushed off the quarter boat which was lying by the dinghy. They would have taken the dinghy, only that she had developed a leak. Schumer explained this as they rowed, and Floyd scarcely heard him; he was thinking of Isbel. He could not possibly take her off with him, and she was safer ashore in the dangerous business that he felt was developing. He had no fear of harm coming to her left alone with Schumer and Luckman, for she was well able to take care of herself, and she was armed. She had told him so. All the same his heart felt heavy as lead at leaving her, even though they were separated only by a couple of cable lengths of water. On board, he gave orders to Mountain Joe for the landing of the crew, and in a moment the deck was swarming. The idea of getting ashore set the fellows chattering and carrying on like school children just set free, and there were no hands wanted to assist at the falls. In a moment the whaleboat was lowered and alongside and the crew tumbling into her. Schumer helped[Pg 285] in the lowering of the boat and shouted directions to Mountain Joe, who took the stern oar. \"They\u0027ll find canvas enough over there if they want to make tents,\" said Schumer. \"As like as not they will prefer sleeping in the open on a night like this. There they go.\" The whaleboat had pushed off, and was now out in the lagoon, making good way despite its heavy load. It looked like a huge, heavy-bodied beetle crawling across the surface of the lagoon. Schumer turned away and followed Floyd down to the cabin for a drink. Floyd had shipped some Bitter Water at Sydney, and he opened a bottle now and produced glasses from the swinging rack by the door. He also brought out a box of cigars. Schumer took a cigar and a drink, and sat down at the table, placing his hat upon it. Floyd took his place opposite to him, and they sat smoking and talking on indifferent matters, Floyd trying to keep pace with the situation and at the same time to appear his ordinary self. Should he deal with Schumer now and at once or let him go ashore and then have a consultation with Cardon? Cardon, he knew, was listening to every word of their conversation, and he had a great respect for Cardon\u0027s judgment. He determined to explain the situation to Cardon now and at once and through his conversation with Schumer. \"It was a good idea of yours to send all the crew ashore at the fishing camp so as to have them on the spot for working in the morning,\" said he. \"Of course that only leaves me on board, and I\u0027m a jolly[Pg 286] sight too tired to stand an anchor watch. However, we don\u0027t want an anchor watch in this lagoon. There\u0027s nothing to look out for but sharks.\" \"That\u0027s so,\" replied Schumer. \"Luckman is off to-morrow, you say?\" \"Yes, he\u0027ll be off to-morrow if this wind holds.\" \"Well, I\u0027m glad to have met him. He didn\u0027t give me a very good impression at first sight, but he improves a bit on acquaintance. He must be a powerfully strong man. I\u0027d sooner have him at my back in a fight than against me.\" \"Yes,\" said Schumer, \"I reckon he could hold his own against any two men, or maybe three, but he\u0027s all strength, not much intelligence.\" \"And it\u0027s the intelligence that counts nowadays,\" said Floyd. \"You see, if a man has a gun and some intelligence, brute force doesn\u0027t count for much, or even numbers. I had an adventure once that proved that to me. I was held up in the cabin of a ship by two ruffians—it was off the South American coast—and I didn\u0027t resist simply for the reason that a friend of mine was close by whom I reckoned to be a much cleverer chap than myself. He was lying in his bunk, and the fellows couldn\u0027t see him. I waited for his lead. His name was Cardon, and I determined to let him decide whether I should put up a fight at once or just sit still and let myself be robbed. It was the funniest sensation, sitting there and waiting for another man\u0027s brains to work out the situation, but I was right. The upshot was I recovered my money.\" He yawned, and then suddenly, switching off the subject: \"There\u0027s no fear, is there, of Luckman getting too close to the pearls? Mind you, I\u0027m not going against your judg[Pg 287]ment about the man. All the same, temptation is temptation, and it\u0027s as well to be on our guard.\" \"The pearls are all right,\" said Schumer. \"They are in the safe, and the safe is in the inner room of the house, and I sleep there.\" He rose to go, flicking the ash of his cigar onto the floor. Floyd rose also. There was no sign from Cardon, so he knew that wily person had decided to let Schumer go ashore. Then he accompanied the other on deck. The boat in which Schumer had come was alongside. He got into it, bade Floyd good night, and rowed ashore. Floyd watched him land. He saw Luckman come down from the house to help in beaching the boat, and then the two men walked up to the house. They entered it, and closed the door, and then beach and reef and grove lay deserted under the starlight. Floyd left the deck and came down to the cabin, and there, at the table, Cardon was seated. \"You\u0027ve done well,\" said Cardon. \"I was afraid you would open the game too soon. Sit down there and give me a few points. What\u0027s Luckman like?\" \"Like a beast,\" said Floyd. \"I heard all you said,\" went on Cardon. \"Schumer has got all the men off the ship, hasn\u0027t he?\" \"Yes.\" \"That\u0027s their first move, and they mean business to-night—when you are sleeping. They won\u0027t act for an hour or two yet, so we have plenty of time.\" \"What\u0027s their game, do you think?\" asked Floyd. \"It\u0027s as simple as sin. They mean to row off, steal down here, knock you on the head, and then scuttle[Pg 288] the schooner. They\u0027ll reckon to take you sleeping. That\u0027s their game, and as like as not, when the business is done, Schumer will do Luckman in and sink him with the ship.\" \"Good God!\" said Floyd. \"I was thinking that myself to-night, and yet you who have never seen Schumer suspected it, too.\" \"Simply because I have studied out the whole proposition while I was lying in that stuffy bunk. Can\u0027t you see how it stands? They must get rid of Luckman. The only thing that gravels me is this: Why did they ever bring Luckman into the affair at all? Why didn\u0027t Schumer knock you on the head, do the thing off his own bat, so to speak? \"I can only work it out like this: If he had done that there would have been witnesses sure. The crew of the Southern Cross would have smelled a rat. There\u0027s nothing more likely to pop out than murder if there are any witnesses that know the murdered party. Schumer wants to break off from the island and every one connected with the pearling. Most likely he suspects the lagoon is beginning to give out. Anyhow, he has got a big lot of stuff, and it\u0027s my belief that his plan is to cut his stick instantly you are out of the way, leave the island and the lagoon and the niggers to look after themselves, and set sail in the Domain with the boodle he\u0027s got. That\u0027s why he has landed the crew.\" \"You mean to say he will desert the island and never come back?\" \"Yes.\" \"But surely if he did a thing like that it would only mean losing a good property. I don\u0027t believe the la[Pg 289]goon is giving out. There was no indication of it.\" \"I only suggested that. It may be giving out or it mayn\u0027t, but there\u0027s this fact, you must admit—the lagoon is not real estate; you have no title to it. Suppose an English man-of-war shoves her nose in and asks you what you are doing here. What will you say? That you are looking for mushrooms? English, French, or German, the first ship that gets wind of the business does for you. They\u0027ll mark it down on their chart and say to you: \u0027This is our island; get out!\u0027 Suppose even a trader comes along and sniffs you. Do you think they\u0027re going to leave a jeweler\u0027s shop like this severely alone? Do you think they won\u0027t say \u0027half shares or we split\u0027? No, sir. You and Schumer have had a very good swig at this cornucopia. It\u0027s amazing you haven\u0027t been interfered with before this. The common-sense thing is to take what you\u0027ve got and do a bunk, cut all connections with the business, and don\u0027t leave a rag of yourselves behind. That\u0027s what Schumer is going to do. Of course he\u0027ll have to play fair with Hakluyt so as to get rid of the pearls and have no trouble about the schooner. Then there\u0027s the insurance money on the Southern Cross. That will be a nice penny for them to divide.\" \"I suppose you are right,\" said Floyd. \"It\u0027s hateful—the whole thing. The world seems suddenly to be filled with devils, not men. I could never have fancied such villainy if I hadn\u0027t gone through it.\" \"Oh, you\u0027ll be pretty tough to this sort of thing when you are as old as I am,\" said Cardon, \"and when you have knocked about the west American seaboard a dozen years or so. You don\u0027t know these[Pg 290] chaps as I do. A sailor doesn\u0027t know anything. You must leave the sea and stick for a few years to the land as I have done to find the truth, and the truth about the Pacific coast is that quite a lot of people don\u0027t give a cent for the life of a man if it\u0027s worth a dollar to them. \"Now, there\u0027s no use in sticking down here any longer. We\u0027d better be getting up on deck and taking our position. I\u0027ve got a plan in my head which you\u0027ll see put in work before long. Have you got your gun?\" Floyd showed the butt of his revolver. \"Right!\" said Cardon. \"And now, first of all, let\u0027s make everything straight.\" There were three glasses on the table, his own, Floyd\u0027s, and the one Schumer had drunk from. He renewed his own glass, looked round to make sure that he had left no trace of his presence anywhere, put out the light, and led the way on deck. At the top of the companionway he turned to Floyd, who was below him. \"Don\u0027t show yourself above the bulwarks,\" said he. \"Crawl along the deck after me to the caboose. That\u0027s the place for us to hide and wait for them.\" \"Right!\" said Floyd. They crawled along on hands and knees till they reached the caboose door. It opened to the starboard, and as the Southern Cross was swinging to the incoming tide, with her nose to the break in the reef, the door of the caboose faced the Domain, and consequently could not be seen from the shore. Cardon opened the door, and they went in, closing the door behind them. [Pg 291]The place was terribly stuffy and filled with the smell of grease and cooking. The copper was still hot, which did not improve matters, and cockroaches were in evidence even in that darkness. There was a scuttle giving aft, and in a moment Floyd had opened it. It gave a view of the whole of the deck aft, and though there was no moon the starlight showed everything. The main hatch, with its cover of tarpaulin, the saloon hatch, the bulwarks, and the planking of the deck so clearly that the lines of division between the planks could be traced, and even the dowels that fixed the planking to the beams. It was a noisome hole to be cooped up in, but it was a splendid post of observation, though, from the size of the scuttle, only one man could keep a lookout at a time. \"We\u0027ll take it turn about,\" said Cardon, \"and the chap that\u0027s off duty can sit on the copper and keep it warm. We haven\u0027t a watch, and a watch would be no use to us, as we daren\u0027t show a light; so we\u0027ll have to guess the length of the trick. Ten minutes each will be the length of the lookout as far as we can make it. I\u0027ll take first, if you don\u0027t mind.\" Floyd had no objection, and he sat on a ledge by the copper, listening and waiting in the dark while Cardon stood on watch. The ship was full of sounds. On deck everything seemed bathed in dead silence, but here, listening in the dark, all sorts of little noises came to greet the ear and imagination. The outside sea sent a vague, almost imperceptible, swell into the lagoon, and as she moved to it she creaked and muttered and groaned, masts, spars, and[Pg 292] body timber all finding points of greater and lesser tension and every point a tiny voice. The rudder shifted now and then slightly, and the rudder chain clicked in response. There were rats on board, and they made themselves audible, and there was a nest of young rats somewhere under the planking, and their thriddy voices came in little bursts now and then, telling of some disturbance in the nest. Floyd pictured to himself the old mother rat suckling them while the father was out on business seeking food, and he philosophized on the idea that even the timbers of a ship may hide all sorts of interests and ambitions, affections and hates. An hour passed, during which he and Cardon relieved each other at the lookout post several times, and it was during Cardon\u0027s watch, some twenty minutes later, that the event occurred. Suddenly a sound made itself heard that was not a sound born of the ship. A faint splash came from alongside, followed by something quite unmistakable—the sound of an oar shipped and laid along the seats of a boat—incautiously. It had probably slipped from the hand of the rower as he laid it inboard. Floyd, who had heard the sound also, tipped Cardon\u0027s leg with his toe, and Cardon, reaching out with his heel, signaled that he knew. A few seconds passed, and then Cardon saw a form coming over the side. It was Schumer. He had never seen Schumer, but from Floyd\u0027s description he knew that it could not be Luckman. Then, surely enough, came Luckman in all his immensity. Neither man wore either boots or stockings, and their bare feet, wet with the bilge water of the boat,[Pg 293] shone in the starlight. Those glistening feet fascinated Cardon. All the tragedy of the business seemed focused in them, and, strong and brave though he was, they exercised such a powerful psychological effect that for a moment he could have retched. The two men did not pause for more than a second. Soundless as shadows, they made for the saloon hatch, while Cardon, who thought the moment for action had arrived, moved slightly as if to leave his post. Then he stopped. Schumer and his companion, instead of going down below, were bending over the hatch. They were closing it. Cardon drew in his breath. He saw at once their object. Instead of going down to kill the man they imagined to be below, they were bottling him up. No man, however strong, could force his way on deck through that hatch once closed. Again he felt Floyd\u0027s toe, as if it were inquiring if all was right, and, again reaching back, he signaled an answer. His eyes were glued to the malefactors, who were now at the main hatch removing the tarpaulin. It did not take long. Then they worked the locking bars loose and removed the hatch with scarcely a sound. He saw Schumer produce something. It was a lantern. They lit it, and Schumer, with it in his hand, vanished down the main hatch into the hold. He was there a full minute that seemed a full hour to the man at the scuttle; then he reappeared. The hatch was closed, but the tarpaulin was not replaced, and, leaving it, they came forward, Schumer carrying[Pg 294] the light and Luckman following him. They passed the caboose, and were lost to sight. \"Now is our time,\" whispered Cardon, turning from the scuttle. \"We\u0027ve got them forward in a close space. Cock your gun and follow me.\" He opened the caboose door and found a vacant deck. For a moment he thought that the two men had gone overboard; then he saw the truth. They had gone down into the fo\u0027c\u0027sle. Floyd saw the situation and the chance in the same flash with Cardon, and in a moment they had flung themselves on the fo\u0027c\u0027sle hatch cover and driven it to. The men who fancied they had bottled Floyd were bottled in their turn. They had imagined a vain thing, and the fact was evidently borne in on them now to judge from the sounds coming from below. The cover of the fo\u0027c\u0027sle hatch was placed at such an angle with the fo\u0027c\u0027sle companionway that it was impossible to make much noise by striking upward from below, and its thickness was well demonstrated by the feebleness of the noise of the men who were now shouting at the top of their voices. \"They\u0027re fixed and done for,\" said Cardon, \"and I reckon Schumer will start repenting in a minute that he sent the crew ashore. Come, we have no time to waste here.\" He ran to the port rail, followed by Floyd. The boat Schumer and Luckman had come in was alongside. Every plan they had made and every preparation seemed working now for their destruction and for the success of their enemies. The[Pg 295] thought crossed Floyd\u0027s mind as he followed Cardon down into the boat, but there was little time to think in, and, taking the stern oar while Cardon took the bow, they pushed off for the shore. Having beached the boat, Floyd led the way up to the house, and as they approached it a figure came out of the grove into the starlight. It was Isbel. Floyd ran up to her as Cardon entered the house; then, as he was holding her hands and trying to tell her all that had occurred, Cardon appeared at the house door with a lighted match in his hand. \"There\u0027s no safe here,\" said he. He lit another match as they followed through the main into the inner room. There was nothing there at all, except the bed which Schumer slept on and the tossed blankets. The safe, which had stood in one corner of the room, was gone. \"That does us,\" said Floyd. He had fancied that the pearls were a secondary consideration, that Isbel was the one and only thing. Now he knew different. Isbel was not the only thing. Without the pearls and the money they would fetch he was nothing. Nothing but a sailorman earning a few shillings a week, tossed hither and thither about the world at the will of an owner. For one terrible minute before the loss of these things he felt his poverty, and there is nothing much more terrible than that if one loves. What had stricken him would strike Isbel. Where could he take her? What could he do with her, he who had no home but a sailors\u0027 lodging home, no resources but[Pg 296] a miserable pittance only to be earned at the cost of separation from her? Cardon brought him back to himself. \"No, it doesn\u0027t,\" said Cardon, \"but it saves us a lot of trouble. Can\u0027t you see? The pearls and the safe are on board the Domain?\" \"On board the Domain?\" \"Where else? Didn\u0027t I tell you Schumer was going to shin out of here in the Domain? Well, he has removed the safe there, and all we have to do now is to go aboard the Domain, up anchor, and get away. He has played into our hands all through, and every point he made against us has turned against him. Don\u0027t you see?\" Floyd did. This last act of Schumer\u0027s put the finishing touch to the business. Not only had he saved them the trouble of carrying off the safe, but he had destroyed all qualms in the mind of Floyd. All Schumer\u0027s plotting, so skillful, so carefully weighed, so intricate, and so powerfully backed by Hakluyt with his ships and money had been brought to naught by one little flaw, one accident—Floyd\u0027s surprisal of Hakluyt\u0027s conversation with Luckman. \"Come!\" said Cardon. They hurriedly left the house, Cardon walking first, Floyd following with Isbel, whose hand he was holding. It was their good-by to the island. In that short walk from the house door to the lagoon edge the fact that he was leaving what he nevermore might see was brought vividly to the mind of Floyd. Never had the place seemed more beautiful from the piers of the reef to the far-off fires, where the pearl fishers[Pg 297] were holding a revel beneath the palm trees with the crew of the Southern Cross. As they rowed across the lagoon, passing under the stern of the Southern Cross, they could hear the songs brought by the wind across the water from the fishing camp. Not a sound came from the schooner, where the trapped men were no doubt fumbling in the fo\u0027c\u0027sle for some means of escape, and not a sound came from the Domain, where the whole crew, anchor watch included, were fast asleep. As they came alongside the Domain, Cardon hailed her, and a fellow rousing on deck came to the bulwark rail, rubbing his eyes. He cast a rope, and the boat was made fast. Then they came on board. Three men had been sleeping on deck, the bos\u0027n and two of the hands, and when Cardon gave the order to rouse the crew and get the anchor up just for a moment it seemed there was going to be trouble. Then Isbel saved the situation. \"It is by Luckman\u0027s orders,\" said she, speaking in the native. \"He is staying here; the ship is to be taken where he wills,\" she finished, pointing at Cardon. Had there been any resistance on the part of the bos\u0027n or the crew Cardon would have promptly dealt with it, but there was none. They were an unsuspicious lot. There had been no sign of disturbance on shore, and whether the ship sail under Luckman or under Cardon did not matter a button to them. Besides, it was due to sail. The water was on board, and Luckman had told them to be ready to weigh anchor at any moment. The wind was blowing steadily for the break in the reef, and now, had you been ashore, you would have[Pg 298] seen the mainsail of the Domain rising like a black wing under the stars to the creaking of blocks and slatting of canvas; then came the sound of the capstan pawls as the anchor chain was hove short, and Floyd\u0027s voice ordering the jib to be cast loose. The tide was near the turn, and it was just approaching the moment of smooth water at the reef opening. Floyd, before starting to work the vessel, had run down to the cabin, where, sure enough, the safe was standing against the couch which ran along the starboard side, and between it and the table. Not only was the safe on board, but Schumer had also brought off the tin cash box holding what remained to them of the money of the Cormorant and Tonga. He had made a clean sweep, only to sweep it all into Floyd\u0027s pocket. Floyd was thinking this as he stood on deck now giving orders for the securing of the anchor which had left the water and was being hoisted, dripping, to the catheads, and now as the mainsail filled to the wind he took the wheel himself. As he turned the spokes and got the feel of the ship answering to his hand a faint, hot, acrid smell came on a puff of wind, a smell of burning, though from where he could not say. He glanced back at the far-off fires of the fishing camp, and fancied it might be coming from that quarter. There was nowhere else possible for it to come from except the Southern Cross, and the Southern Cross showed no sign of smoke or fire as she lay there mute and somber, her spars cutting the starlit sky and her hull blackening with its shadow the starlit water. [Pg 299]So gently did the Domain move that, viewed from the deck, it seemed that past her, lying stationary, the reef and the trees were gliding aft. Then the pierheads of the reef passed like ghosts or shadows, and the Domain rose to the swell of the outer sea and sank, bursting the foam away from her bow like snow. Floyd gave the wheel over to the bos\u0027n, and stood for a moment looking aft across the sea; then he turned and went below, where Isbel was waiting for him in the cabin. Cardon, left on deck, paced up and down, now with an eye on the binnacle card, now glancing aft, as though on the watch for something he expected to appear in the wake of the schooner. The wind had freshened, and the Domain was making a good eight knots. Not a cloud was to be seen in the star-spangled sky, nor a sail on the sea line, nor a sign now of the island. The atoll island does not show up well at night. It is less an island than a kink in the sea over which a vessel may trip just as a man trips over a kink in a carpet, and, looking back now as Cardon was looking, nothing could be seen of the shore they had left. Till suddenly Cardon drew in his breath, clutched the after rail, and stood motionless and gazing at a pale orange-colored glow marking the sky on the sea line they were leaving. Even as he watched the glow deepened in color to an angry red. A great fire was in progress over there. One might have fancied that the whole of Pearl Island had caught[Pg 300] alight and was blazing like a torch in the wind. But Cardon knew better. He knew that what he was watching was the destruction of the Southern Cross. When he had seen Schumer going down into the hold with the light he had guessed what was forward. Schumer had fired the vessel, and then, to make sure, he had gone into the fo\u0027c\u0027sle with Luckman to fire her in a fresh place. The fire had proclaimed itself now, and Schumer and his companion, bottled up in the fo\u0027c\u0027sle, would by this be beyond praying for. Cardon had said nothing to Floyd of his suspicions, and now as he watched them verified he determined to keep the matter still to himself. There was no use in troubling the mind of Floyd. As for his own mind, he was not in the least troubled. What Schumer had prepared for another he was receiving himself, and Cardon was not the man to pity a traitor and a murderer or to quarrel with the justice of fate. But it was strange beyond imagination to watch that steady, silent, distant glow, knowing what it meant. He watched it increasing to a certain point and decrease to a certain point. Of a sudden, with a heave and flicker, it went out, and the stars burned clear where the glow had been. The Southern Cross had sunk at her anchorage, and Cardon, turning away, left the deck and came down to the cabin where Floyd and the girl were seated.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1823/52933.html","bookId":1024,"book":{"id":1024,"title":"The Pearl Fishers","description":"简介： The sun was breaking above the sea line, and the Pacific, heaving to the swell, lay all to the eastward in meadows of gold....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1823","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:09 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:09 AM"}}
