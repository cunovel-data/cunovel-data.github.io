{"id":12467,"no":10,"title":"CHAPTER X THE SCHOONER","content":"They started for the fishing ground next morning immediately after breakfast, and set to work at once. They had bad luck for the first hour, and then, as if popped into their hands by the hand of luck, came a beauty, a perfect white pearl, twice the size of a marrow-fat pea, maybe even a little bigger, worth five thousand dollars if a penny—so Schumer said. They sat down to congratulate themselves and feel their luck. You cannot feel your luck standing. Schumer lit a pipe and Floyd followed his example. They put a bit of seaweed on a shell and the pearl on the seaweed, and with it in front of them began to speculate and talk. They felt now that time was theirs, and Schumer knew, though Floyd was still to learn, that the flower of success blooms only on the youngest shoots, that the joy of striking it rich lives only in perfection during the first early days of the stroke, that the fever of life and the enchantment of triumph both die down and fade, that the fully grasped is nothing to the half grasped. To be given a pearl lagoon by luck and to work it as a hog works a wood for truffles would be to act like a hog. [Pg 80]The stuff was all there; this and the success of the first day\u0027s work was ample confirmation of the riches lying under that green water, and Schumer expatiated on the matter. \"You wouldn\u0027t believe it,\" said he, \"but the value of a single pearl grows in proportion as you can match it with others exactly like it. It takes eighty or a hundred pearls to make a woman\u0027s necklace. Eighty or a hundred pearls like that one would each be worth two or three times what each pearl is worth alone. Even twenty pearls exactly alike would be worth much more than if they were different, for they would form the basis for a collection. You would never dream of the work that goes on in the world matching these things. There are men at it all the time in Paris and London and Amsterdam. A perfect necklace of pearls once formed is always held together; it becomes an individual, so to speak, and is known to the trade by a name. The women belonging to the royal families of Europe hold a number of these collections, but there are lots of private ones, and every great collection is known and tabulated. So you see it won\u0027t pay us to peddle our stuff out little by little—we must hold all the pearls we get and match them.\" \"Look here,\" said Floyd, \"one thing we have never settled—our shares in this business. There\u0027s Isbel, too; she has done her bit.\" Schumer laughed. \"What\u0027s the use of money to a Kanaka?\" said he. \"We\u0027ll give her something, of course, but we need not take her seriously into our calculations. Our shares—well, don\u0027t you think it\u0027s a bit early to come to that?[Pg 81] All this is a dream in the air at present; it may never go farther.\" \"Well, it\u0027s this way,\" said Floyd, \"I always think it\u0027s well to start out knowing exactly where you are going to, and what you are to get. When you sign on in a ship you know your pay, and you know the latitudes you have got to work in, and you know the time you are to be on the job. I think it would be better here and now to settle up this business, and I think we ought to go half shares.\" \"Half shares?\" said Schumer meditatively. \"I have been figuring it out in my head,\" said Floyd. \"What have we each contributed to the business? I have brought my work and a boat; now, without a boat we\u0027d have been done completely, because you can\u0027t reach here by the reef, and we couldn\u0027t have discovered the beds without a boat. Then there\u0027s my work. You have brought your knowledge of pearling, and, what is more, all that trade stuff and provisions from the wreck, your energy and enterprise and your work. When I said half shares I did not mean that all the trade and provisions of the Tonga should not be taken into consideration. I would suggest that when we settle up I should pay you for all that out of my share. Then there is the money of the Tonga and the Cormorant. While I hold that Coxon\u0027s money belongs by right to his next of kin, I think what I have suffered through his relative, Harrod, permits me to use that money to further our speculation, paying it back with interest to the next of kin when all is through. So I would be nearly equal to you in ready cash, and the question resolves itself into my boat and work against your work and knowledge of pearling.\" [Pg 82]\"I must point out to you,\" said Schumer, \"that I discovered the beds.\" \"That is true, but without the boat where would you have been? If a ship had come along and you had borrowed a boat to explore the lagoon, the whole affair would have been given away. I am not arguing to make a profit out of the business at your expense, only to give my full views on the matter.\" Schumer sat silent for a minute, and Floyd again noticed that profile, daring and predominant, hard and predatory. It was as though the spirit of a hawk were gazing over the sea through the mask of a man. \"It seems to me,\" said Schumer, \"that the boat belonged to Coxon.\" \"And the Tonga?\" said Floyd. Schumer shifted uneasily; then he laughed. \"Well, let it be so,\" said he; \"half shares, and you pay for the trade and provisions; it\u0027s early to talk of dividing what we have not got. Still, as you wish it, I agree.\" He spoke without enthusiasm. Then he rose up. They had been sitting on the weather side of the reef, with their backs to the lagoon and their faces to the sea; the wind had almost died away, and now as they turned they saw, away across the lagoon, a thin column of black smoke rising from the camping place through the almost windless air. \"It\u0027s the signal!\" said Floyd. \"A ship!\" cried Schumer. He sheltered his eyes, and Floyd, doing the same, saw the figure of Isbel moving about near the fire. She was putting fresh brushwood on the flames, and even as they looked the smoke increased. [Pg 83]Schumer picked up the pearl that was still lying in the shell and put it in his pocket. He glanced at the heaps of shell still untouched. There was no time to cast all that back in the lagoon or hide the evidence of their work; it was necessary to get back at once, and, returning to the boat, which was beached on the sand, they shoved off, Floyd taking the sculls. When they reached the beach, Isbel was there, and helped to run the boat up. \"A ship,\" said she. \"Schooner, I think, away over there.\" She pointed across the reef toward the outer sea. The deck of the Tonga had always given them a vantage point and a lookout station; even without it now, just by standing on the reef where the wreck had been they could see the sail, and Schumer, after a brief glance, went off to the tent, which they had re?stablished by the grove, and fetched a pair of glasses. Through them she leaped into view, a topsail schooner, with all sail set, making a long board for the island. \"She\u0027s coming here, sure,\" said Schumer; \"a hundred and fifty or maybe a hundred and eighty tons I reckon her to be; but it is deceitful at this distance. Wonder what she is? Wonder what she\u0027s doing down here? She may have been blown out of her course by that storm; but she hasn\u0027t lost any sticks. Well, we\u0027ll soon see.\" They watched the sail as she grew white as a pearl against the sky. The sea had lost all trace of the late storm, and there remained only the undying swell of the Pacific. \"I don\u0027t know what\u0027s the matter with her,\" said[Pg 84] Floyd, as he took a spell with the glasses; \"but she seems to be handled by lubbers. Either they have not enough men to work the sails, or the officers are fools.\" Schumer took the glasses and watched her, but said nothing. One of the coconut trees at the entrance end of the grove stood apart from its fellows; it had been stripped of nuts and pretty well stripped of leaves by the storm. At the suggestion of Schumer, Floyd, with a flag tied round his neck like a huge muffler, and with a hammer and some nails in his pocket, swarmed up the tree and nailed the flag to the wood. The wind was strong enough to make it flutter, and with a glass aboard the schooner it would be easily visible. It evidently remained unseen, for no answer showed. \"She\u0027s blind, as well as stupid,\" said Floyd. \"There\u0027s something wrong with her,\" said Schumer, \"and if she comes blundering into the lagoon she may hit that reef we noticed the other day on the left of the entrance. We had better get the boat out and show her the way in when she gets a bit closer.\" The schooner was two miles from the reef when they began launching the boat. They rowed out through the break in the reef, and then hoisted the sail. \"She sees us now,\" said Floyd. A flag had been run up to the peak; it was the Stars and Stripes. Then it was run down again, then again hoisted. \"Crew of lunatics,\" said Schumer, as the American flag went down again and was replaced by the union Jack. \"What are they at now?\" \"They seem to be a mixed nationality,\" said Floyd,[Pg 85] \"and rather confused in their mind. Look, she\u0027s heaving to!\" The wind shivered out the canvas and the topsails flattened. She was, as Schumer had guessed, a schooner of some hundred and fifty tons, and well found, to judge by her general appearance, her canvas, and what they could judge of her sticks. As they came alongside they saw that her decks were crowded with men, all natives; not a white face showed, and as they boarded her a hubbub rose such as Floyd had never heard before. Forty Kanakas, mad with excitement and all trying to explain themselves, some in broken English and some in native, produced more impression than understanding. Schumer took hold of affairs by seizing on a big man whom he judged with unerring eye to be in some position of authority. Then he held up his fist and yelled: \"Silence!\" The row ceased in a second, and only Schumer\u0027s voice was heard: \"You talk English?\" \"Me talk allee right,\" replied the big man. \"Me savvee English me——\" \"Shut up and answer my questions! What schooner is this, and where from?\" \"She de Sudden Cross.\" \"The Southern Cross; where from?\" \"Sydney long time \u0027go; lass po\u0027t in de Sol\u0027mons. Capen, off\u0027cers, all gone; fish p\u0027ison.\" \"Fish poisoning, was it? What was your captain\u0027s name?\" [Pg 86]\"Capen Watters.\" \"Walters, most like,\" said Schumer. \"Well, what are all these men—they aren\u0027t the crew?\" \"Some de crew; some labor picked up down de Sol\u0027mons, an\u0027 islan\u0027s away dere.\" \"And your cargo?\" \"Copra, most.\" While Schumer was talking, Floyd was looking about him at the men on deck. There were a dozen Solomon Islanders, some wearing nothing but G strings, nearly all with shell rings through their nostrils, and some with tobacco pipes stuck in their perforated ear lobes. He thought he had never seen a harder lot of natives than these. The others were milder looking. Schumer, meanwhile, went on with his inquiries. The name of the big man was Mountain Joe; he was bos\u0027n. The schooner, since the loss of her officers, had been in a hopeless state, as not a soul on board knew anything of navigation. There had been four white men—the captain, two mates, and a third man, evidently a trader or labor recruiter—and the fish that had done the mischief had been canned salmon; evidently ptomaine poisoning in its most virulent form had attacked the only people who had partaken of it. When Schumer had received all this intelligence, he ordered the boat to be streamed astern on a line, and took command of the schooner. Without with your leave or by your leave, he gave his orders no less to Floyd than to Mountain Joe. The Solomon Islanders and the other natives who had no part in the working of the vessel fell apart from the crew, who sprang to the braces at the order of their[Pg 87] new skipper, the sails took the wind, and the Southern Cross began to forge ahead. The wind was favorable for the lagoon opening, and as they neared it Schumer ordered Floyd forward to con the ship while he himself took the wheel. As he steered, he gave his orders to Mountain Joe to get ready with the anchor. The Southern Cross responded to her helm as a sensitive horse to the bit, and like a great white cloud she glided over the swell at the reef opening, and like a great white swan she floated into the lagoon. Then the wind shook out the sails, and the rumble-tumble of the anchor chain sounded over the water as she came to in five fathoms, and within a pistol shot of the camping place. Isbel was standing on the beach sheltering her eyes with her hand, and some of the Kanaka crew, recognizing her as a native, waved and shouted to her. She waved her hand in reply. The schooner now swinging safely at her anchor, Schumer continued to give orders till all of the remaining sail was stowed. Then he turned to Floyd. \"Now, we have her safe and sound,\" said he, \"I propose we go down and have a look at the manifest, and so forth.\" \"You aren\u0027t going to land any of these people yet?\" asked Floyd, following him down the companionway to the saloon. \"Not yet,\" said Schumer; \"and when I do land them it won\u0027t be at our camping ground. Hello, you nigger!\" this to Mountain Joe, who had followed them[Pg 88] down; \"what you doing here? Get on deck or I\u0027ll boot you up the ladder—cheek!\" Mountain Joe vanished. \"Look here,\" said Floyd, as he shut the door of the saloon, \"do you believe that yarn of the fish poisoning?\" \"I don\u0027t,\" said Schumer; \"I believe the white men were done up. They were a hard lot, most likely, and they met their match. There was fighting on deck, for there was a bullet mark on the wheel, one of the spokes was injured; not only that, I could tell from the manner of those fellows that the big Kanaka was lying. Ah, what\u0027s this?\" He went to one of the panels of the saloon by the door. It was split by a bullet. \"Look at that!\" said he. \"It\u0027s clear enough,\" replied Floyd, \"there has been fighting down here, too. Devils!\" \"Oh, well,\" said Schumer, \"we haven\u0027t heard their side of the story yet. Come on, let us search and see what we can find.\" They entered the biggest cabin opening off the saloon. It was evidently the captain\u0027s. Here things were in order, the bunk undisturbed, and a suit of pajamas neatly folded on the quilt. \"Bunk hasn\u0027t even been lain on,\" said Schumer, \"and where would a sick man lie but on his bunk or in it? These Kanakas are fools—soft heads; they can\u0027t put two and two together, or imagine other people doing it. Now, let\u0027s look for the ship\u0027s papers.\" They hunted, but though they discovered the box which evidently had contained the papers, sign of[Pg 89] papers or money there was none. Neither was there sign of the log. \"They have done away with them,\" said Floyd. \"Looks so,\" replied Schumer. \"Unless the old man swallowed them before he died. Ah, here\u0027s a coat of his!\" A coat hanging from a peg by the bunk attracted his attention. He examined the pockets, and discovered a number of letters, an American dollar, a tobacco pouch, and a pipe. He returned the pipe and the pouch, and placed the letters in his pocket. \"We\u0027ll examine them later on,\" said he; \"they may give us some news. Now let\u0027s look at this chest and see what it holds.\" He raised the lid of a sea chest standing opposite the bunk, and began to explore the contents. It contained mostly clothes, boots, some island curios, and down in one corner another packet of letters, which Schumer took possession of. On the inside of the lid was nailed the portrait of a stout woman—the unfortunate man\u0027s wife, perhaps. To Floyd there was something mournful in the sight of these few possessions—all that was left on earth of a man living a few weeks ago, or maybe a few days ago, and now vanished utterly; done to death, most probably, by the savages on deck. But Schumer did not seem at all disturbed by any reflections on the matter. With speed but no hurry he went through the business, closed the lid, and rose up. \"Let\u0027s get on deck,\" said he; \"we can overhaul the other cabins later on. I have seen what I wanted to see, and there\u0027s no use in leaving those fellows on deck[Pg 90] too long without attention. I\u0027ll have another talk with the big Kanaka, and then we\u0027ll go ashore and have a council of war.\" \"Shall we let any of these chaps land?\" asked Floyd. \"Not yet; and when we do we\u0027ll land them at the reef by the fishing ground. Looks like Providence, doesn\u0027t it? We wanted labor, and it seems we\u0027ve got it.\" \"They seem a tough crowd,\" said Floyd, as he followed his companion up the saloon stairs. \"They are,\" said Schumer grimly; \"but they\u0027ll be softer when I have done with them.\" On deck, the crew and the Solomon Islanders were scattered about, mostly smoking. Some were seated on the deck; others, leaning over the bulwark rails, were staring at the shore. There was no sign of disorder or danger; the unfortunates were too glad to be in a place of safety, after their experience of driving about the Pacific without a navigator. The open sea is a terrific place to the Pacific islander when he does not know in what part of it he is, and when he is left to his own resources. Schumer\u0027s prompt action in bringing them into the lagoon, the way he handled the ship, and the manner in which he had given his orders at once raised him to the position of the man in authority. He ordered the boat, which was still streaming astern, with the rope held taut by the outgoing tide, to be hauled alongside, then he told Mountain Joe to get in, and, following him with Floyd, they pushed off for the shore. When they landed, Schumer called to Isbel, who came out of the bushes. He told her to look after the big Kanaka and give him some refreshment, and then,[Pg 91] taking Floyd by the arm, he led him over to the windward side of the reef, and at a point protected by trees from the lagoon they sat down. Said Schumer: \"When you are starting out on any business everything depends on whether you have got a plan to go on at the start. A lot of darned fools blunder along in the businesses they take up without even a plan. If they have a plan, it\u0027s one that turns up by accident. \"Now, here\u0027s our position: Luck has sent us a schooner and a certain quantity of labor. Good management and foresight has given us a lot of trade, provisions, and arms; all that will be useless if we don\u0027t act at once on a plan. \"If we let those fellows land here, and if they discover the position of the cache, it\u0027s quite on the cards they might try to rush us. They mustn\u0027t touch the ground here; they must be segregated over there at the fishing ground. We have a splendid strategical position, with a section of the reef impassable, or next to impassable, for if they tried to come along it they\u0027d have to go so slow we could pick them off with our Winchesters. \"But that\u0027s all meeting trouble halfway. Our policy is to keep them happy after putting the fear of God into them. \"I shall land them to-night over there, but first of all I am going to show them exactly how things stand, and what they may expect if they make trouble. \"Now come back, and we will have a talk with Mr. Mountain Joe.\" They came back to the tent, where the dusky bos\u0027n was wiping his mouth with the back of his hand. [Pg 92]Isbel, who had been giving him refreshments, was standing by. When she saw Floyd and Schumer approaching, she went off toward the tent, and the three men found themselves alone. Out in the lagoon lay the schooner, the crowd on her deck leaning on the bulwark rails, and evidently speculating on what might be going on ashore. Joe, who had been seated, rose up, and Schumer, taking his seat on the sand beside Floyd, ordered the Kanaka to stand before him. Schumer, taking a tobacco pouch from his pocket and a book of cigarette papers, proceeded to roll a cigarette. As he ran the tip of his tongue along the gummed edge of the paper he looked up at Joe. \"What made you tell that lie,\" said he, \"about the fish poisoning?\" Joe started as though some one had made an attempt to strike him. \"What fish p\u0027isonin\u0027, sah?\" \"Now, don\u0027t you try any games with me,\" said Schumer, who had lighted his cigarette. \"I know all about the affair, and I am going to see justice done. Your captain was killed, the mates were killed, and the other white man was done away with and hove overboard. I take it he was not a trader, but a labor recruiter. Don\u0027t open your mouth to lie, or I\u0027ll put a bullet in it!\" He put his hand in his pocket and drew out a revolver, which he placed on his thigh. \"You just hear me through, for I am going to tell you things. To begin with, I doubt if you had any hand in the killing. I judge you by your face. Had you any hand in it? You may speak.\" [Pg 93]The man\u0027s lips were dry; his tongue could scarcely form the words: \"No, sah, it was not me.\" \"It was some of those Solomon Islanders?\" \"Yes, sah.\" \"Which was the one that did it? There\u0027s always one that takes the lead.\" Joe was silent. \"Which was the one that did it?\" asked Schumer again, without the least change in his voice, but with his hand now on the butt of the revolver. \"De big one, sah, wid de woolly head an\u0027 eyes so.\" He tried to squint. \"Ah, that chap! I noticed him, and I took his measure.\" Then, little by little, he drew out the whole story. It had been a bad voyage for the Southern Cross. They had been recruiting down in the Solomon Islands, and the recruiter, Markham by name, had been nearly cut off. He had adopted the usual methods, landing on the beach with a box of trade goods and without any weapons, while a covering boat hung offshore to protect him in case of attack. The natives had seemed friendly, but all at once they had drawn off, scattering toward the bush, from where next moment had come a flight of their deadly spears, one of which had pierced Markham\u0027s arm. With the spear still in his arm, he had managed to get off, and under protection of the fire from the covering boat had succeeded in reaching the schooner. The spear had been cut out, or, rather, cut off at the barb and drawn out, but the wound had bothered him a lot. [Pg 94]The thirty natives he had managed to secure before the business suffered a good bit at his hand in return for it. The captain and the mates had not been behindhand; some of the crew had run away, and the schooner was shorthanded; that did not add to their good temper. They tried to make the Solomon Islanders help in the working of the vessel, but these gentry had not engaged themselves for ship work, but plantation work, and they said so. The captain had booted some of them and threatened to shoot others, and generally the schooner seemed to have been a hard ship. There seemed the distinct evidence of a trail of drink over the whole business, and the upshot was death for the afterguard. Death dealt with belaying pins and an ax wielded by the woolly-headed individual with the squint. Two natives had been shot dead on the spot, one had been wounded, and had died of his wounds. Then the decks had been swabbed, and the precious crew, without a navigating officer or the faintest notion of their exact position, had made sail, or, rather, made a fair wind that was blowing, trusting to chance to take them somewhere. They had touched the skirt of the big storm, but they managed to weather it, and, seeing the island in sight, had made for it. \"Well,\" said Schumer, \"I believe you have been telling me the truth. I am here to do justice, and justice shall be done.\" He rose up, and drawing Floyd aside, walked a few paces with him along the beach. \"That fellow with the squint was evidently the leader in this business,\" said he. \"I am not thinking so much[Pg 95] of the trouble on board the schooner, for it\u0027s pretty evident that the old man and the mates and the recruiter deserved their gruel. What I am thinking of is the time before us. I am going to make these chaps work the fishery, and I don\u0027t want a potential murder leader among them. That wouldn\u0027t do at all. Besides, they must be shown at once their position in the scheme of things, and that position is laborers working for decent pay, but under a strong hand. Besides, all these fellows have murder on their conscience—or the thing, whatever it is, that serves for their conscience. That will always make them nervous and distrustful of white men. I can\u0027t clear their consciences, but I can clear their minds of the fear of consequences, and I am going to do it now. \"You have your revolver in your pocket; get your rifle, also, and come with me. We may have to fight; there\u0027s no knowing.\" \"I shouldn\u0027t mind if we have,\" said Floyd; \"rotten murderers!\" \"Oh, they are all right! They are only savages, doing according to their lights. They only require firmness to do according to the lights of civilization.\" He went to the tent with Floyd, and they got their rifles and some extra ammunition. Then, with the help of Joe, they pushed the boat off. The fellows on board watched the coming of the boat, evidently suspecting nothing, though they must have seen the rifles. Schumer was the first to come on board, followed by Floyd. They walked aft, and Joe, when he had finished securing the boat, followed them. [Pg 96]Schumer sent him below for two deck chairs which he had seen in the saloon; they were placed close to the wheel, and the white men, taking their seats, and with the rifles across their knees, Schumer threw his old panama hat on the deck about fifteen paces away from where he was sitting, and ordered all hands aft for a palaver. No man was to take a step beyond the hat. They came up, some of them still smoking, some chewing, and all evidently wondering what was up, and what the bearded white man with the fixed, determined face had to say to them. Though he could speak in the dialect of the Solomons, he made Joe his interpreter. He asked the labor hands first what wages the recruiter had promised them for plantation work. They were very explicit on this point. They were each to receive in trade goods, tobacco, knives, and so forth what would be the equivalent of about seven pounds a year. They were, of course, to be fed and looked after. Schumer, taking a pencil and a piece of paper from his pocket, made calculations. Then he addressed them through Joe. He said that he and Floyd were owners of this island, which was a very pleasant place, as they could see for themselves, with plenty of food, both grown here and brought to them regularly by a ship, which they also owned. To allow this to sink into their intelligence, he proceeded to roll a cigarette; when he had lit it, he went on. He would offer them work here, and a happy life, and a return home at the end of a year, if they desired[Pg 97] to return. The work was very easy, and play, compared to plantation work; it was simply diving for shellfish. They could all dive? A flashing of white teeth answered this question in the affirmative. He would pay them exactly the same wages as that offered for plantation work; each man would have to collect so much shell—the amount would be fixed later—and for all shell collected over and above the stipulated amount, a bonus would be paid in tobacco or whatever they liked. The bonus business had to be explained to them, and the idea took hold upon their imaginations at once. They agreed to everything. The island pleased them; there was evidence of what Schumer had stated all round—plenty of trees, fruit, and in the lagoon fish. It seemed to them that they had dropped on their feet at last. They broke up into little groups and chattered over the business while Schumer sat watching them with a brooding eye. Any other man, one might fancy, would have been more than satisfied by the success which had apparently met his offer. In reality, he had only begun what he had set out to do. When they had talked together long enough, he gave orders to Joe, and they were lined up again. Asked if they agreed to the terms offered to them, they replied, \"Yes.\" Then Schumer, throwing the end of his cigarette away, crossing his knees, and nursing the rifle lying across his lap, began speaking to them in their own dialect without the aid of Joe. [Pg 98]He talked to the Solomon Islanders, but the others quite understood his words. He pointed out that from what he had seen below stairs, he knew for a fact that the captain of the Southern Cross and the other white men had not died from fish poisoning, but from blows. He told them that an English man-of-war was cruising in the neighborhood of the island, and that if she caught them they would undoubtedly be hanged to a man; he gave them a pantomime with his hand at his throat to help their imaginations, and, seeing the effect produced, at once started on a new line. They had nothing to fear if they trusted in him and in the white man beside him, but justice must be done. It was impossible for white men to allow other white men to be murdered or killed without bringing the murderers to book. He did not believe that they were all implicated, but he did believe that there was one among their number who had led them to this act. Dead silence among the audience, whose faces laughing a moment ago, were now a picture representing all the emotions that range between furtiveness and fright. No one spoke. \"Very well,\" said Schumer, still speaking in the native, \"if you will not speak it will be the worse for you. I am not your enemy. I am your friend, and am able to protect you all from the consequences of what has been done; but I will not do so unless I can punish the man who was chief in this business. You will not show him to me; well, then, I will find him for myself, for I have been born with the means of know[Pg 99]ing men, and I can see their thoughts, just as you can see the fish that swim in the lagoon.\" He rose from his seat and walked toward where they were standing. The line bent back for a moment, as though they were going to break away and run, then they stood their ground; every eye was fixed on him as he went from one to the other, lifting this one\u0027s chin with his finger, resting his hand on that one\u0027s head. Floyd, still seated, had his rifle ready in case of accidents, but it was not needed. The diplomacy of Schumer had made the crowd afraid, not of him, but of the consequences of their act, and to cap that, they were held by the fascination of this business and the curiosity to see what was about to happen. When Schumer reached the squint-eyed individual he placed his hand on his head. Then he snatched it away, as though something had stung him, and looked at the palm. \"You are the man,\" said he. \"Look!\" He held up his palm for a second; there was nothing in it, but every man in that crowd saw something, according to his imagination.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1823/52912.html","bookId":1024,"book":{"id":1024,"title":"The Pearl Fishers","description":"简介： The sun was breaking above the sea line, and the Pacific, heaving to the swell, lay all to the eastward in meadows of gold....","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Classic","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/jingdian/1823","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:09 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:24:09 AM"}}
