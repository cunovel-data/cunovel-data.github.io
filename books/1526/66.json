She had been fumbling with the last timer, obviously trying not to look at her watch constantly as Jason\u0027s time ran low. In her hurry, she had crossed two wires wrong and almost mistakenly activated the detonator. He had been correcting her mistake when the explosion roared from across the base. As the echo faded around them, Linda just looked at Khalid. \"There just wasn\u0027t enough time,\" Khalid said, though truthfully he\u0027d never intended to rescue the boy. Khalid studied her, expecting her to rage against him, to cry and scream. But no. She just stared at him, a cold deadness in her eyes. A woman who had given up. Good. He didn\u0027t need her to fall apart on him now. She was learning. Expediency. The desert sun burned those who moved slowly. He shook his head. \"Let\u0027s finish up here.\" She turned and stared across the base to the cloud of smoke from the explosion. \"It didn\u0027t work,\" she said dully. He put down the tiny screwdriver. \"What?\" She pointed, her arm leaden. \"The column… Jason was tied to. It\u0027s still intact.\" He straightened up and stared. She was right. It seemed totally undamaged. How was that possible? He studied the drifting smoke. Something was wrong. The explosion had occurred slightly west of the column. \"The boy must have gotten free of the ropes. Moved away from the column.\" His words seemed to ignite a moment of hope in her bearing, but then she sagged, seeming to realize that, free of the column or not, the explosion had occurred. \"Let\u0027s go,\" Khalid ordered. She didn\u0027t argue as she was led away. THIRTY-FIVE BEN SAT ON THE LEATHER SOFA IN BLAKELY\u0027S OFFICE, nursing his aching shoulder. He needed to keep moving. This sitting around was making his shoulder throb. Harry had painfully yanked it back in place earlier. Jason sat next to him now, kicking the sofa with his heel, still tense. The boy had been through a hell of a lot. He had finally related the events that led to Ben\u0027s discovery of him. Sandy sat on a chair behind Blakely\u0027s desk, twirling a strand of hair between her fingers. Dark circles were etched beneath her eyes. \"Poor Dr. Blakely,\" she mumbled. Ben nodded. He regretted all the foul thoughts he had harbored for the leader of this bloody mission. He didn\u0027t deserve to die like that. Harry finally reappeared at the office door. \"I\u0027ve got everything ready, Ben. Let\u0027s get movin\u0027.\" It was about time. Mo\u0027amba\u0027s message of danger still burned fiercely in Ben\u0027s mind. This waiting was agonizing, but Harry had insisted that Ben rest for a few minutes while he organized a quicker way for Ben to get back to Ashley. Pushing off the sofa, Ben felt a twinge of protest from his shoulder. \u0027Show me what you\u0027re talking about,\" Ben said, wincing. \"It\u0027s just outside the office. C\u0027mon.\" Harry led the way. After telling Jason to stay put, Ben followed Harry down the scorched hall. The entrance was demolished, the door hanging askew on its hinges. Harry waved to the two mimi\u0027swee hunters who had led the crak\u0027an on a wild goose chase. They had returned, not even looking tired from the hours of cat-and-mousing. Harry patted his fellow hunters on the shoulders, then proceeded outside. \"I\u0027ll leave with the boy just as soon as you take off,\" Harry said. \"We\u0027ll take the elevator to safety, but you need to hurry.\" \"I know. Watch your back, though, and protect that boy. There\u0027s still a madman setting other bombs around here, and I don\u0027t want Jason falling within his clutches again.\" Ben saw the shallow crater from the explosion for the first time. Almost two yards in diameter. The surface rock looked burned. He noticed there was no carcass of Tiny Tim. Ben smiled grimly. The beast had probably been blown to tiny pieces. He turned to Harry. \"Now what are you hiding up your sleeve?\" Harry wore a shit-eating grin. \"Come see.\" Harry led the way to the side of the building. He pointed proudly. \"My masterpiece.\" Leaning on the wall was a black motorcycle, trimmed in chrome. Ben whistled in appreciation. \"I retrieved it from my dormitory after reconnoitering the area. Figured it would be a quick way back to the wormhole. This baby will outrace any damned crak\u0027an.\" \"Bloody grand idea.\" Ben patted the seat. \"Is it gassed and ready?\" \"Yep.\" \"Then let\u0027s get the show on the road. I don\u0027t know where that damned Khalid is, or what he\u0027s planning next, but I don\u0027t think we should wait.\" \"What about the woman he\u0027s holding hostage? The biologist?\" Harry asked. \"Should we look for her?\" Ben closed his eyes and clenched his fists. He pictured Linda\u0027s nervous smile. He hated his next words. \"No, he said, his voice strained, \"it\u0027s too risky. For all we know, she may be dead already. Just get that boy to the elevator and out of here.\" Harry nodded. \"Then let\u0027s move.\" Within minutes, Harry had everything ready. Ben straddled the bike, a pilfered rifle strapped under his left thigh. His backpack was cleared of everything but the paper-wrapped statue of ohna. One of the mimi\u0027swee hunters-Ben couldn\u0027t remember his name-reluctantly climbed behind him on the bike. Sighing, Ben called to Harry and pointed to the tiny hunter. \"I can return the statue on my own.\" \"It\u0027s not safe to travel alone. There\u0027s sure to be other pods. Now go!\" Jason stood by the side of the bike, obviously nervous about seeing Ben leave. Ben winked at him. \"I\u0027ll be back. And it\u0027ll be your mom on the back of this hog the next time you see me.\" This generated a small smile, but his eyes still had a worried look to them. \"Be careful, Ben.\" \"Always.\" Ben engaged the throttle, and the bike roared, raising an involuntary smile to his lips. The smile turned to a grimace as the grip of his passenger tightened to the point of cutting off circulation to his lower half. Ben patted the squeezing arm. \"Easy there, buddy.\" The grip loosened… but only slightly. With a final wave, Ben slipped the bike forward, proceeding at a moderate pace. There was too much scattered debris to proceed faster than a man could run. But after a few minutes, getting accustomed to the cycle\u0027s handling, he increased his speed, a wide grin on his face. He flew past a field of flattened tents, heading east to detour around the chasm since the bridge was out. He tried his best to ignore some of the human debris on the path. Like roadkill, he thought dourly. His smile faded to a grim line. Thankfully, within a few minutes he had cleared the base and sped toward the north wall. He breathed deeply the cleaner air, appreciating the abating stench of smoke and rotting flesh. As he raced toward the distant dwellings, following the rough man-made track, he searched for any sign of the crak\u0027an ahead. Nothing. But he was well aware that the darkness beyond his headlamp could hold herds of those monsters. He held his breath as he sped along, his palms sweaty on the bike\u0027s handles. He kept searching, straining to pierce the black curtain around the bike. Something howled from a distance away, but otherwise no sign of the beasts ever appeared. Thankfully, he reached the north wall without encountering a single crak\u0027an. Almost too easy. He cut the engine. The small hunter was off the bike in a heartbeat, backing away as if from some foul creature. Using his flash-light, Ben grabbed his rifle and followed his agile partner up the levels of dwellings to ohna\u0027s chamber. The little hunter was first to the chamber, practically flying into its security. Ben followed close behind. As he reached the entrance to the dwelling, the hunter, just steps ahead of him, suddenly fell back into Ben\u0027s arms. What the hell? The hilt of a dagger protruded from his small chest. The hunter stiffened in his arms, then jerked into a violent convulsion. Ben couldn\u0027t hold him any longer and dropped him to the ground. Poison. Ben flashed his light forward. Two hunched mimi\u0027swee tribesmen stood before him, thick with muscle and damned familiar. The silaris, the poisoned ones. Ben backed a step away from the threshold, giving himself room to raise his rifle. Just as he shouldered the weapon, something slammed into the back of his head. He collapsed to his knees, a spray of lights dancing across his vision. He fell forward across the entryway, his rifle falling from limp fingers. Pain squeezed his vision to a tiny dot. But it was enough to see the scrawny physique of Sin\u0027jari step over him. He wiped Ben\u0027s blood from his staff, leaned over, and stared into Ben\u0027s eyes. He smiled in triumph as Ben\u0027s world faded to black. \"I\u0027m telling you,\" Ashley said, pacing the dimensions of the cell, \"that damned Sin\u0027jari meant for everything to happen the way it did. He plotted the whole thing.\" Michaelson studied the guards at the threshold to their prison cell. \"From the way those guys keep eyeballing us, I don\u0027t think they\u0027re gonna be in any mood to listen to reason, even if we could speak their tongue.\" Ashley glanced over to the four mimi\u0027swee guards. \"You know what the worst thing about this situation is? It\u0027s that these people will always view us as murderers. And I\u0027m to blame. I\u0027ve been an anthropologist for close to a decade, and this is how I handle first contact with a new tribe.\" \"Ashley, quit kicking yourself. The situation\u0027s extraordinary. And it was Sin\u0027jari that screwed it up. Not you.\" Ashley spoke between gritted teeth. \"If only there was some damned way to correct it. If we could-\" The sudden prattling of the guards interrupted Ashley\u0027s words. She took a step forward to see who the guards were addressing and recognized the scarred face of Tru\u0027gula, the leader of the hunters and a good friend of Mo\u0027amba\u0027s. This didn\u0027t bode well. Tru\u0027gula snapped at the guards, his fellow hunters. They moved aside for their elder. He stalked into the chamber, his knuckles white on his staff. Stopping in front of Ashley, he just stared at her, his eyes wounded. He seemed to be weighing her, judging her. Ashley knew she should not waste this moment. Maybe Tru\u0027gula would listen. She turned to Michaelson and grabbed his shoulders.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/subterranean/page-66.html","bookId":1526,"book":{"id":1526,"title":"Subterranean","description":"Storyline: Travel to the bottom of the earth to a place you never dreamed existed.
