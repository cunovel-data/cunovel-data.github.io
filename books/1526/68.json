She watched as the hunters tangled with other, puglike mimi\u0027swee, but the few hunters were quickly overwhelmed by the score of attackers. And to make matters worse, a single jab by an attacker\u0027s spear or dagger sent the mildly injured into convulsions. Soon only she, Michaelson, and Tru\u0027gula were still standing. At least ten of the short, muscular attackers surrounded them. \"Silaris!\" Tru\u0027gula said, and spat in their direction. The offenders made no move toward them, seeming nervous about attacking one of the elders. A noise behind them drew everyone\u0027s attention to the wormhole. As she watched, Sin\u0027jari slipped out of the tunnel, followed by two ugly mimi\u0027swee. Ashley recognized them as the two who were with Sin\u0027jari before. She also recognized the resemblance between them and the attackers blocking the exit. They were Sin\u0027jari\u0027s men, his clan. Sin\u0027jari smiled, showing all his teeth. He didn\u0027t have to say a word. He just fingered a dagger and stepped toward Ashley. Groaning, Ashley realized she\u0027d led them all into a trap. Ben willed Harry\u0027s sled to faster speeds, the rock walls a blur around him. Going downhill with the throttle fully open had increased the speed to fifty miles an hour. On turns, he banked to the ceiling. He squinted forward, needing to pay close attention, ready to brake as soon as he saw the exit. To fly out of the wormhole at this speed was certain death. He shifted the rifle from under his hip where it chafed. C\u0027mon, the exit shouldn\u0027t be too far ahead, he thought. Maybe if he concentrated, used his heri\u0027huti powers, he\u0027d get an inkling of how far he had to go. He relaxed his eyes and willed his heart to slow. Even before he\u0027d achieved the proper state, someone reached him. Someone was calling to him. An image coalesced in front of him, superimposed over the sight ahead like some wispy ghost. A scarred face. Tru\u0027gula. The figure blinked a few times, then spoke. \"Hurry!\" \"I know. I got that message already,\" Ben said. \"Then see with my eyes.\" For just a few seconds, the tunnel vanished and he was in umbo\u0027s chamber. He saw. Gasping, his heart clenched, and the link shattered. Ben prayed for more speed, rage fueling him forward. Michaelson tried to block Sin\u0027jari\u0027s approach toward Ashley, but a quick flip of the elder\u0027s wrist had five of the silaris dragging him back. Ashley glanced over to Tru\u0027gula. He struggled futilely in the clutches of two of the silaris. No aid there either. Sin\u0027jari stepped toward her. \"He no help. He weak.\" Ashley was flabbergasted at his words. \"You speak English.\" He nodded. \"I learn my enemy. Best way-\" He scrunched his brows together, pondering his next words. \"To know them,\" she offered. He smiled at her as if she were a small child. \"No. To kill them.\" Raising the dagger to her chin, he leered at her. \"Poison. That right word?\" He motioned toward the dead hunters. She nodded. He pricked his own finger. Then waved as if it were nothing. \"I lead silaris. Poison not kill us. We strong. We lead.\" \"What about Bo\u0027rada? I thought he was your leader.\" \"Bo\u0027rada?\" He made a foul sound with his mouth. \"No smart. I lead Bo\u0027rada.\" Ashley realized that this coup had been in the works long before her team appeared. Their arrival had almost screwed up Sin\u0027jari\u0027s plan, but he\u0027d turned it to his own ends. \"Now I lead. I say kill all you. And any others come here.\" Ashley shook her head. \"You won\u0027t win this. Tru\u0027gula\u0027s hunters won\u0027t allow it.\" A sly look came to his eyes. He pointed to Tru\u0027gula. \"Bad. He help you others kill Mo\u0027amba.\" He then tapped his chest with the dagger. \"I find out.\" He slashed the dagger through the air. \"I stop.\" So Tru\u0027gula was going to be pinned as an accessory to the crime, a coconspirator. Dead men tell no tales. She glanced at him, but his eyes were half closed. Sin\u0027jari noticed it too. He poked the wounded hunter with a finger, getting his attention. They spoke back and forth for a few minutes. Angry words. Finally, Sin\u0027jari turned his back on him and faced Ashley again. He pointed a thumb toward Tru\u0027gula. \"No smart. He call help. But nobody there. Mo\u0027amba dead.\" He sneered at her. \"Now you.\" He raised the poisoned dagger and stepped toward her. She tried to back away but was blocked by the silaris behind her. Just as Sin\u0027jari grabbed Ashley\u0027s throat with a bony hand, a noise erupted from the wormhole. Sin\u0027jari twisted his neck around to look. Ashley jumped as the transport sled blasted out of the wormhole and flew across the chamber, colliding into several of the silaris, knocking them off their feet. The distraction was enough to allow Ben to crawl from the wormhole. He was standing before anyone was even aware he had appeared. He raised the rifle to his shoulder and pointed it at Sin\u0027jari. \"Mate, I suggest you let the lady go.\" Sin\u0027jari hissed at him and plunged the dagger toward her chest. Ben fired. Ashley saw the left side of Sin\u0027jari\u0027s head fly away. His body stood there for half a second, dagger still poised, then crumpled to the floor. A couple silaris rushed toward Ben. He swung his rifle, and in two shots, two bodies lay on the floor. \"Any others?\" Suddenly, from behind the group of silaris, as if by magic, a troop of hunters appeared, bristling with long spears. \"Meet a few of my friends,\" Ben said with a smile. \"I placed a quick call before arriving. This bloody heri\u0027huti means of communication could put the phone company out of business.\" The silaris, without their leader, put up little fight and were roughly herded away. Ashley rushed over to Ben and wrapped him in her arms. \"You\u0027re okay. I didn\u0027t know… didn\u0027t know what Sin\u0027jari had done up there.\" She squeezed him and, muffled against his chest, said the words she had held so long in her chest. \"I love you.\" \"Ay? What was that?\" he said, pulling back to look her square in the face. \"I… I love you.\" He slipped back into her embrace. \"Oh, that. I knew you did. I was just wondering when you\u0027d figure it out.\" \"Shut up.\" She reached up and kissed him. Ben then moved his lips to her ear. \"You know, there\u0027s someone up top who\u0027s waiting for a big hug and kiss too.\" She pulled back from him, her hands clenched on his shoulders. \"Do you mean-\" He nodded. \"Jason\u0027s fine. Just a bit shook up like the rest of us.\" Tears blurred her vision as Ben smiled down at her. He then pulled her into a tight embrace. In his arms, she felt the strength of family she\u0027d never experienced before. Still in his arms, Ashley watched Bo\u0027rada stalk into the chamber, confusion evident on his features. Crossing to the scarred figure, he spoke heatedly to Tru\u0027gula, who answered with repeated gestures. Bo\u0027rada\u0027s eyes grew wide. \"I leave you for a second,\" Ben whispered, \"and see how much trouble you get into.\" Once Tru\u0027gula finished, the leader stared with disgust at Sin\u0027jari\u0027s body, then turned to Ashley and Ben. He bent his head solemnly in their direction. As apology or thanks, she wasn\u0027t sure. Ben broke free of her embrace. \"I forgot.\" He crossed to Sin\u0027jari\u0027s body and fingered open the pouch on the dead man\u0027s belt. He reached inside and pulled out the diamond statue. \"Ohna!\" Ben held the figure up for all to see, then crossed over and placed the female statue on the pedestal next to the male figure. \"They make a nice couple, don\u0027t you think?\" THIRTY-SEVEN JASON SAT ON A SOILED CHAIR IN THE DEMOLISHED RECEPTION room of Blakely\u0027s office. He had his cracked Nintendo Game Boy in his lap and was trying to tape it together. Harry and his companion creatures were outside somewhere, patrolling, keeping an eye on things. Ever since the explosion of the elevator, Harry wanted the area watched closely. Jason knew he was supposed to stay with Sandy back in Blakely\u0027s office, but she was giving him the creeps. All she did was stare off into space, fiddling with her hair. She didn\u0027t even say a word when he got up. He thought about how Ben had saved him, and hoped desperately that he would return soon with his mom. Then a soft scritch-scritching noise from outside froze him in the chair. It was probably Harry or one of the others. Wasn\u0027t it? The noise came again. It sounded like a bunch of boards was being shifted around. He quietly stood up and took a step toward the hallway, toward safety. When he heard the noise once more, his curiosity got the better of him. He took a step toward the decimated entrance to the building. He\u0027d just take a peek. It might be important, or nothing at all. Holding his breath to avoid any detection of his position, he snuck around an overturned desk to get a clear view out the building. He stared, waiting for the sound to repeat so he could tell where it was coming from, afraid even to blink in case he should miss something. Nothing was out there besides the crater from the explosion and piles of debris strewn around the edge by the blast. Nothing moved. He started to straighten from where he crouched. Probably just- Then he heard and saw it at the same time. A muzzle, protruding from under a pile of tumbled lumber and bricks, about twenty yards away. It was easy to miss, camouflaged well with the black rock and scorched debris. If it hadn\u0027t moved, he\u0027d have overlooked it. It moved again, shifting the debris until a black eye swung clear. It seemed to be staring straight at him. Jason knew it was the beast who\u0027d been sniffing him when he was tied up. The one Ben called Tiny Tim. Jason froze, afraid to draw its attention further. He watched as it dropped its head back to the floor, obviously still dazed, groggy, recovering from the explosion. Jason needed to warn someone that it had survived. Then a new sound intruded. A voice. A familiar voice. Female. Crying.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/subterranean/page-68.html","bookId":1526,"book":{"id":1526,"title":"Subterranean","description":"Storyline: Travel to the bottom of the earth to a place you never dreamed existed.
