Didn\u0027t you say that meant there were continued passages?\"\n \"I guess so.\" His voice was a whisper.\n She glanced at him, wondering what he balked at. Surely not the climb. It looked like a piece of cake to her. \"Ben?\"\n He shook his head as if clearing cobwebs. \"Of course, you\u0027re right. Everyone hook on your quick draws and belaying harnesses. We\u0027re going up.\"\n Ashley stared at the Aussie. She had only known him a short time but already knew his moods. Something was bothering him. \"Ben, you\u0027re the expert here…\"\n He fastened his rope in place and approached the rock face. \"I\u0027m fine with this. Just had this urge to…\" He shook his head again. \"Hell, never mind. Let\u0027s go.\"\n She watched his left hand jitter as he gripped his first handhold.\n Linda woke with a snap, her head pounding. Khalid lay on a mattress nearby, snoring loudly. It was one of his rasping snorts that had startled her. She glanced at her watch. Four hours had passed since the two had retired for a nap after lunch. She glanced at Villanueva. He too was sound asleep.\n Odd. She was never one to take naps, let alone allow hours to slip by like that. She sat up and stretched. Of course, the present circumstances were unusual. After running all day yesterday from monsters, her body deserved a rest.\n She stood up, and the room spun; pinpoints of light exploded across her retinas. She almost stumbled to her knees, close to blacking out. After a few wobbly seconds, the spinning stabilized. Must have stood too fast, she thought, shaking her head. Her heart pounded loudly in her ears, each beat throbbing at her temples. She reached for her canteen and took a deep swallow.\n Breathing heavily, she saw something that almost made her drop her canteen. The walls! The smooth-surfaced fungus was now festooned with protruding balls of growth. As she watched, several hundred pods burst, releasing a small puff of smoky dust. Spores! In the lamplight, billowing clouds of spore dust wafted through the chamber. She watched as Khalid inhaled a stream of the smoky air.\n This couldn\u0027t be healthy. She knelt by Khalid and shook his shoulder. He didn\u0027t awaken. She shook him harder. Nothing. She raised his eyelids; his pupils were dilated in the bright light, nonresponsive. Damn, the spores were acting like a drug. Anesthetizing them! She realized that if they kept inhaling the drug, an overdose pended.\n The fungus was trying to kill them!\n Agitated, her breathing grew ragged. Blossoms of color flared across her sight. The spores! Must remain calm. Must breathe slower. Take in less of the drug. She held her breath. Still the room began to spin again. Think, damn it!\n An idea occurred to her. She grabbed a handkerchief and splashed water over it, soaking it. She wrapped the dripping fabric over her mouth and nose. The moistened fabric should filter the spores. At least she hoped it would.\n Hurrying, she applied a similar wrap to Khalid\u0027s face, trying to prevent him from taking in any more spore dust. Don\u0027t you die on me, she thought.\n She scooted to Villanueva. For a moment she thought he had stopped breathing. But on closer inspection, she could see his chest rise and fall. Still, his complexion had a blue tinge. Cyanotic. She prepared a third handkerchief and wrapped it around the SEAL\u0027s face.\n Clenching her fists, she studied him. The SEAL\u0027s breathing was ragged and shallow. In his debilitated state from yesterday\u0027s attack, he was more susceptible to the drug.\n She glanced around. The glowing fungus had dimmed slightly while sporulating, probably to conserve energy for the production of the spore dust. But what had set it off? Their body heat? A change in the level of carbon dioxide from their breathing?\n She did not have time to seek answers. Right now she had to get them out of here. But where? There was no telling if the monsters still lurked in the other chamber. And who knew what awaited them if they followed in the other team\u0027s footsteps?\n Only one thing was certain. If they stayed here, they would die.\n She crossed to the wormhole that Ashley and the others had gone down several hours ago. A slight breeze blew up from below, wafting a few blond strands of her hair.\n The air was fresher, free of spores.\n She made a decision. She would have to drag the two men through this wormhole. If anything threatened beyond, they could at least stay in the passageway. But more importantly, the direction of the breeze should keep blowing the spores clear of the wormhole.\n At the thought of hiding for days in the narrow tunnel, a twinge of anxiety threatened, but she squelched it. She turned to the men. It would be difficult hauling them over the rough terrain of the floor. The jumble of diamond made the sleds useless, but once at the wormhole, she could use the sleds to easily maneuver them from there.\n She crossed to the two sedated forms. Grabbing the SEAL\u0027s legs, she hauled him toward the wormhole, grunting with the effort. After fifteen hard minutes, she had both men in the wormhole, sprawled across their sleds. Her head pounded and sweat stung her eyes. By now she weaved drunkenly as she stood, unsure if from the strain or from the drugged spores.\n She splashed her face with more water, readying herself. Holding her breath, she dove into the wormhole, trying to ignore the walls pressing around her, concentrating on maneuvering the men ahead of her. She shoved Khalid\u0027s limp form forward, bumping his shoulder into Villanueva\u0027s sled, causing the SEAL to roll several yards ahead before settling to a stop.\n Bumping her way forward, it was slow progress. But the farther away from the cavern they progressed, the clearer her head became. She stopped for a moment and rested, leaning a cheek on her arm. She had done it! The air was clear here.\n A groan arose from Khalid. He was waking. She allowed herself a weary smile. Only a vague sense of unease because of the closely surrounding rock intruded on her satisfaction. But it was only that of a buzzing gnat, not the usual panicked roar. No, the enclosing grip of the tunnel had lost its hold. She had saved them.\n Ashley followed Ben\u0027s lead, placing her hands and feet where he placed his. Her fingers stung and her thighs screamed. The fungus growing on the walls made the grip slippery, but at least the farther they climbed, the less prevalent the fungus was. As they progressed, they eventually had to turn on their helmet lamps. With the disappearance of the mold, the perpetual darkness had crept back to smother them.\n Michaelson followed, pushing her over some of the rougher spots.\n She watched Ben jam a quick-draw bolt in a crack above and secure a loop of rope. He was humming roughly under his breath as he worked. After two hours of climbing, she was sick of that tune.\n \"Ben,\" Michaelson called from below. \"How much farther?\"\n \"\u0027Bout another hour.\"\n Ashley groaned, leaning her face into the rock.\n Ben continued, \"But there appears to be a wide ledge about ten yards up. We should be able to take a lunch break before we challenge the last leg of the climb.\"\n Grasping that small hope, Ashley thanked the gods of climbing. \"Then let\u0027s get up there, Ben. I\u0027m tired of hanging around here.\"\n She watched Ben reach for a handhold and pull himself upward. \"You wanted to come this way,\" he said in good cheer. \"I was the one who wanted to go the easy way, so quit your bellyaching.\"\n At least his initial trepidation had seemed to fade as the strain of the climb progressed. The first hour of the climb had been easy, but it was only a warm-up for the nearly vertical climb they had been struggling with for the last hour.\n Ashley stretched up to secure her hand on Ben\u0027s previous foothold. She couldn\u0027t quite reach. She searched for an alternate hold on the sheer face. Only a blank wall faced her. Damn. \"Ben, I can\u0027t get past this point,\" she called, trying to hide her increasing panic.\n Ben glanced down at her. \"No problem, Ash. Just let go. I\u0027ll haul you with the rope to the level of the next quick draw. Then you can reestablish your holds. I\u0027ve got good leverage here.\"\n She swallowed hard. Common sense kept her clutched to the wall.\n He winked down at her, seemingly reading her mind. \"I won\u0027t drop you.\"\n Embarrassed by her doubts, she willed her hands to let go. The carabiner brakes held her in place as she hung from the rope, swinging away from the wall and out over the hundred-yard drop. Suddenly she jerked upward as Ben\u0027s arms pulleyed rope through the quick draw.\n In two pulls, she was hauled next to him, still swinging a couple feet from the wall. He held his hand out to her. She reached for him. His fingers slid across her palm before gripping her hand. His eyes never left hers as he pulled her toward him. He held her waist steady, his palm hot through her damp T-shirt, as she planted her feet and gripped the wall.\n \"Thanks, Ben.\"\n \"Anytime, love,\" he whispered in her ear, then brushed her cheek with his lips.\n She blushed and glanced away. \"We\u0027d… uh… better get going. Michaelson\u0027s waiting.\"\n He turned back to the wall and continued. She watched him climb with the ease of a mountain goat, his legs spread wide. She had to force her eyes away before she could continue, her cheeks still flushed.\n Within ten minutes, all three were sitting on the ledge, sipping warm water and chewing on jerky and dry cheese.\n Ben sat close to Ashley\u0027s side, his leg brushing hers. They ate in silence, all of them exhausted. Michaelson seemed lost in his own thoughts.\n Finally, Ashley dusted crumbs off her lap and pushed to her feet, her leg muscles wobbling. Planting her fists on her hips, she glanced up the pocked slope. Thankfully, it was a short, easy grade. If she had to climb another vertical wall, she\u0027d need at least a day\u0027s rest.\n Ben stood up beside her. \"Ready?\"\n She nodded.\n \"Okay,\" Ben said, \"then let\u0027s cinch up and head on out.\" He grabbed the bundle of climbing rope and hooked her to him. He stood close as he knotted her up, then leaned toward her. \"Sometime we\u0027re going to have to try this when we\u0027re not rock climbing,\" he said with a jaunty grin.\n Rolling her eyes, she shook her head. \"Let\u0027s get going.\"\n Whistling that damned tune again, Ben tackled the slope. Ashley followed. For a good part of the ascent, she found she could simply walk, only needing to crawl over short sections of the climb. Near the very top, though, the climbing became tricky again. Footholds and handholds had to be searched for carefully, each yard gained only with planning and muscle. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/subterranean/page-32.html","bookId":1526,"book":{"id":1526,"title":"Subterranean","description":"Storyline: \n Travel to the bottom of the earth to a place you never dreamed existed.
