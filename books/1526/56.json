We have a lot to do before tomorrow.\" As they turned to leave, he stared back at Mo\u0027amba, the old man\u0027s eyes drilling him. Should be an interesting night of dreams, he thought as he followed Ashley out the exit. Back at the hunters\u0027 enclave, Ashley stared at the still form of Villanueva at her feet, too stunned to speak. She had almost forgotten about the others left in the diamond cavern, figuring they were safer where they were. Eyeing the bullet wounds in the SEAL\u0027s forehead, she realized there were more dangers here than the caverns and its denizens. \"It must have been Khalid,\" Michaelson said. \"What about Linda?\" Ashley asked. \"Did the hunters see her?\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" the major answered. \"I didn\u0027t have a translator.\" He nodded toward his brother, who was deep in conversation with a hunter named Tomar\u0027su. \"Hopefully, Harry can get an answer to what happened.\" Ashley couldn\u0027t stare at the corpse-white face of Villanueva any longer. As she turned away, something caught her eye-in a ragged pile of collected loot stood a familiar fluorescent green plastic object. Her sled. She had thought it lost after she and Ben had crashed here. She noticed Ben\u0027s red sled had also been recovered. Pretty efficient scavengers, she thought, but that made perfect sense considering the meager resources afforded them. Suddenly the conversation between Harry and Tomar\u0027su escalated in volume. Ashley glanced in their direction. Harry was holding up his fingers, apparently counting off some point. Finally, in exasperation, Harry clenched his fist and turned away, ending the conversation. \"What was that all about?\" Ashley asked as he rejoined the group. \"He wasn\u0027t making any sense,\" Harry said. \"He described what sounded like gunfire. The noise drew his hunters to the diamond cavern. By the time they got there, they only found this… this dead soldier.\" \"Villanueva,\" Ashley corrected. \"He was a friend.\" Harry nodded, his brow furrowed in concern. \"When I asked him about the other two, he said his team followed their trail to a cavern with a waterfall and observed them camping.\" \"So Linda is alive?\" \"Well, that\u0027s the weird part. When I asked them how many were there, he said there were four of them.\" \"Four?\" Ben said. \"I know.\" Harry ran a hand through his hair. \"I kept asking him over and over again. He was adamant. Four.\" Harry held up four fingers. \"Seems as soon as we solve one mystery another crops up,\" Ben said. The news gnawed at Ashley. Even with the recent events, she had to know… \"Where are these four now?\" \"Tomar\u0027su says they went into a tunnel that smelled like death, and his hunters balked at following them.\" \"Smelled like death?\" Harry shrugged. \"That\u0027s what he said.\" They all stood silent for a long moment. Ashley finally spoke up. \"To hell with it. We aren\u0027t going to solve this now. Let\u0027s concentrate on the situation at hand. Harry, you mentioned you might have a quicker way to traverse the wormhole.\" Harry brightened at her words. \"Yeah, maybe. If I can get it to work. Come see.\" He led her and the others to a neighboring cavern, almost a cubicle. \"Not much,\" he said, ushering them in, \"but it\u0027s home.\" In a corner, thick green pillows huddled under a rumpled blanket. The remainder of Harry\u0027s cubicle consisted of an odd assortment of crude tools, spearheads, and a long tarp-wrapped object. Ashley curled her nose at the strong smell of gasoline. Gasoline? Harry followed them inside, squeezing past her. \"All the others at Alpha Base are electric-whining little put-puts-but I jury-rigged my own with a combustion engine. I wanted power.\" He bent over and grabbed the edge of the tarp. \"After I was attacked, my fellow hunters retrieved it from our last camp. It was pretty beat up, but I\u0027ve been tinkering with it.\" He yanked the tarp free, revealing a transport sled. One of the big ones. \"I built it out of aluminum to be light-weight. Blakely let me bring it since we didn\u0027t think we\u0027d need heavy ammunition for our explorations.\" He sniffed in derision. \"I brought one fucking pistol with me. Stupid!\" \"Does the sled still work?\" Ashley said, trying to keep the conversation on course. \"Mostly. It used to collapse down to a compact size for carrying, but it\u0027s jammed open. Still, this is just a straight trip up. So that shouldn\u0027t be a problem.\" Harry patted the sled. \"The engine\u0027s sound, but I only have a single tank of gasoline, so I\u0027ve been leery of running the engine for a long time. Probably needs a bit of tuning still.\" \"Is there enough gas to get all the way up?\" Ben knelt down and cocked his head from side to side, studying it. \"Should be plenty.\" \"Harry used to race dirt bikes,\" Michaelson said. \"He knows his way around an engine. If he thinks it\u0027ll work, it will.\" Ben nodded, seemingly satisfied. \"This\u0027ll buy me several hours.\" \"There\u0027s only one problem,\" Harry said. \"The front axle\u0027s bent. If I can fix it, it\u0027ll be an all-nighter. So you might want to have a Plan B… just in case.\" \"Right,\" Ashley said, \"then let\u0027s get a few things settled. Since I\u0027m the only one being held hostage here, Isuggest everyone else accompany Ben on his mission. Put as few at risk as possible down here.\" \"No, ma\u0027am!\" Ben argued. \"I\u0027m going alone. A solo mission.\" \"You\u0027re gonna need firepower,\" Ashley said. \"There\u0027s no telling how many of those crak\u0027an are still hovering around Alpha Base.\" \"She\u0027s right,\" Harry said. \"The council has allowed a small team of hunters to go with you. Since we\u0027re officially blood-bonded hunters, my brother and I can accompany you. Trust me, you\u0027ll need the backup. I can tie those cheap plastic sleds of yours to mine and form a train to drag everyone quickly up top.\" Ben\u0027s face reddened with determination. \"I won\u0027t leave Ashley here alone. She\u0027s-\" \"I\u0027ll stay with Ashley,\" Michaelson interrupted. \"My ankle\u0027s crap. I\u0027ll only slow you all down anyway. Maybe Ashley and I can come up with a contingency plan… if it comes to that.\" Ben seemed as if he was going to argue further, but their arguments seemed to be wearing him thin. \"All right! Harry can come. But, Michaelson, whatever it takes, I expect to see the mother of my child again.\" \"You will, Ben.\" Ben nodded, but Ashley\u0027s mind was whirling. Mother? She had succeeded in pushing that fact from her mind, but Ben\u0027s words had dredged it back up. She placed a hand on her belly. Mother? She didn\u0027t even begin to know how to feel about that revelation. But one point of motherhood she was damned sure of… \"Ben, you\u0027ve got to find Jason. Even if it means scrubbing this mission. Promise me.\" \"I\u0027ll try,\" Ben said. \"You know I will.\" \"Don\u0027t just try. Do it.\" Ben reached to her and folded her in his arms. In his embrace, the tears she had been holding back finally flowed. She sank deeper in his arms. THIRTY BEN LAY AWAKE IN HIS CELL. HE KNEW HE NEEDED TO rest. But after a day of planning, plotting, divvying up arms, and choosing the mimi\u0027swee hunters to accompany them, his mind still ground on details of the mission. What if he didn\u0027t succeed? He rolled hard onto his left side, burrowing into his pile of pillows and twisting the thin blanket tight around his feet. Ashley\u0027s face kept flashing across his mind\u0027s eye. Earlier, she had been led to a separate cell for the night. Guarded. A hostage. They were not even allowed a final night together. He rolled onto his back and sighed loudly. This worrying was getting him nowhere. Maybe stretching his legs a bit would help. Besides, he should check on Harry\u0027s progress. Slipping from his pillows, he crossed to the exit. Within a few minutes, he had made his way back to the section of hunters\u0027 caves. Harry was bent over the disassembled sled, pieces strewn across the rocky floor. Michaelson leaned over his shoulder. A loud snap cracked across the cavern. \"Shit!\" Harry jumped back from the sled. \"What\u0027s wrong?\" Ben asked, stepping up behind them. Harry held up two pieces of aluminum rod. \"Not good. I pushed too hard and snapped the axle.\" Ben\u0027s heart clenched in his chest. \"Can you fix it?\" \"I don\u0027t think so. I was softening the aluminum with heat and trying to straighten the bend when it snapped. I should have waited until it was softer, but was afraid of weakening the metal.\" Harry threw the pieces to the floor. \"Sorry, Ben. I screwed up.\" Michaelson laid a hand on Harry\u0027s shoulder. \"You did your best.\" \"Fuck that. I blew it.\" Harry shrugged off his brother\u0027s hand. \"Don\u0027t beat yourself up,\" Ben said. \"So we use the plastic sleds and push our way up. It\u0027ll slow us down somewhat, but we\u0027ll manage.\" At least he prayed so. What if this delay made the difference between succeeding and failing in their mission? \"Listen,\" Michaelson said to Harry. \"I may have an idea.\" \"What?\" Ben said. Michaelson, his eyes tired and irritated, glanced back over his shoulder and pointed to the exit. \"Ben, just go to bed. Let my brother and I work this out. It\u0027s a long shot anyway, so get yourself some rest.\" Ben only stared, glassy-eyed. He knew the major was right. \"We\u0027ll see you in the morning,\" Michaelson said, turning his attention back to Harry and the sled, dismissing him. During Ben\u0027s journey back to bed, his mind spun with the ramifications of Harry\u0027s bad news. Even if it took them eight hours to crawl the thirty miles, surely the remaining day would leave them plenty of time to accomplish their goal. It would have to, he thought adamantly. Suddenly he realized the twists and turns in the tunnels didn\u0027t look familiar. He turned and looked back the way he had come. Should have taken that last turn… or maybe angled left back by the big boulder.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/subterranean/page-56.html","bookId":1526,"book":{"id":1526,"title":"Subterranean","description":"Storyline: Travel to the bottom of the earth to a place you never dreamed existed.
