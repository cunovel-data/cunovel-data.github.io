The sound of snapping bone accompanied the collision.\n She stared down at him. He groaned, eyes narrowed with pain, as he struggled into a rappelling position, using only one leg. Satisfied that the major had survived the fall, she turned back to the cliff\u0027s edge.\n The monster had disappeared beyond the horizon of her view. She could hear it snorting and sniffing up there, claws tentatively scratching at rock, searching. C\u0027mon, Ben, get down here. She listened for any further sign of what was going on up there. Silence. She glanced to her left. Ben\u0027s rope was gone! When had that disappeared?\n A loud snort of glee drew her attention. The hunter had found its prey. A frantic scraping and scrambling erupted.\n \"Look, Ma!\" Ben\u0027s voice was savage. \"I knitted you a new scarf.\"\n A bellow of rage.\n Suddenly Ben leaped over the edge, shooting over empty space, rope trailing. As he reached the end of the slack, he twisted in midair to face the cliff and plunged toward the wall. Using his legs, he absorbed the brunt of the impact. Only an explosive \"Oof\" indicated that the collision had any effect on him.\n \"Ben…?\" She said, relieved and confused. \"What about the-\"\n Ben pointed up.\n She turned her eyes back to the cliff\u0027s edge. The marsupial\u0027s head dangled over the cliff, its blubbery tongue hanging from its slack jaw. Ben\u0027s rope was looped around its neck, digging a trench in its flesh.\n Ben pushed a pouted lip at the beast. \"Now, how\u0027s that for gratitude? I don\u0027t think she likes my present.\"\n As the SEAL groaned and opened his eyes, Linda checked his pulse. \"He\u0027s coming out of it,\" she said. She had been worried that in his weakened state the fungal spores may have been too strong for him.\n \"That\u0027s good,\" Khalid said. From his queasy expression, he was still suffering from the aftereffects himself. He closed his eyes and pressed fingers to his temples.\n \"Here. Try this.\" She passed him a damp towel. \"Lay back and place this over your eyes.\"\n He smiled wanly at her but accepted her offering.\n As he lay back, Linda turned to Villanueva. She wiped the SEAL\u0027s forehead. With Khalid\u0027s help, she had been able to transport him to a relatively fungal-free chamber. A stream of cool water coursed through the cave, slightly tangy with dissolved minerals. The only entrance to this room was a narrow hole, too small for any large predators. Still she kept a pistol resting on a rock within arm\u0027s reach.\n Villanueva struggled to speak between sticky lips. \"W-w-water…\"\n She helped him sit up and raised a cup to his lips. With shaky hands, he collected the cup and managed himself.\n \"What happened?\" he asked, glancing at Khalid, who now snored quietly from under the wet cloth.\n She explained the story of the poisonous fungal spores while he finished his water.\n He handed her the cup. \"Is there anything down here that doesn\u0027t want to eat us?\"\n She grinned at him. \"This is a hostile environment. I think for anything to survive it must learn to utilize the scarce resources to the fullest. That means intense competition and varied modes of attack.\"\n \"Great. What\u0027s next? Carnivorous butterflies?\"\n She shrugged.\n He shook his head. \"Damn, I could use a smoke.\"\n \"I don\u0027t think that would be good for you.\"\n He raised his eyebrows. \"I\u0027ve just about had my arm yanked off, I\u0027ve been a chew toy for a monster, and now some freakin\u0027 mold tried to poison me. I think I can survive one cigarette.\"\n She nodded. \"I could check in Khalid\u0027s stuff. He has a few extra packs. I\u0027m sure he wouldn\u0027t mind sharing one.\" She tugged his pack over to her, surprised at how heavy it was, then fumbled the flaps open. She rummaged through the extra clothes and climbing gear. \"It\u0027s got to be in here somewhere.\"\n \"That\u0027s all right. I could-\n \"Here, I think I found one. Still in its cellophane.\" With her arm buried to the elbow, she felt the plastic crinkling with her fingertips. \"Got it!\" She pulled her arm free, clutching her find. Embarrassed, she realized it wasn\u0027t a pack of cigarettes. Curious, she held it up to the light to see the object better.\n Villanueva\u0027s eyes sprang wide when he saw what she held in her palm. \"Careful with that.\"\n \"What is it?\"\n \"Plastic explosive. Let me see it.\"\n \"Explosive?\" She handed him the cellophane-wrapped block of clay.\n He flipped the package around. \"This insignia stamped into it… it\u0027s German manufacture.\"\n \"Why would…?\" She glanced at the sleeping man. \"As a geologist, maybe he thought he might need to explode some sections to get to samples.\"\n The SEAL shook his head. \"I was briefed. I would have been told if someone had plastique. This is obviously contraband. Pass me his pack.\"\n She held her breath, and a thousand thoughts bounced around her head as she passed him Khalid\u0027s pack. She now recalled how guarded he was at times when anyone handled his pack. How odd some of his expressions were when anyone asked about his past. But she also remembered his strong hand pulling her up steep slopes and his kind words of encouragement.\n Villanueva closed the pack. \"There\u0027s twelve packages in here. Enough to bring the entire volcano crashing down on us.\" He reached for her pistol, but his injuries prevented him. \"Give me your gun.\"\n Instinctively, she started to obey, but with her hand on the pistol grip, she froze, suddenly unsure what to do.\n With a rattling snort, Khalid coughed himself awake. He pushed the cloth off his face and sat up. \"What are you…?\" His eyes shifted from Villanueva with the pack to Linda with the gun. His brows drew together, lowering over his eyes. His accent became thicker. \"What the hell are you doing with my pack?\"\n His words were directed at the SEAL, but the heat of his anger scorched her too. Embarrassed, words flowed from her. \"We were just looking for a cigarette and-\"\n Villanueva cut her off. \"What is your game here, Khalid? Who sent you?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about. Give me back my pack.\"\n The SEAL shook his head. \"Go to hell.\"\n Linda backed a step away from the combatants. Her gun hung limply in her fingers. She kept staring at Khalid. He was the same man who had shared his canteen with her. The same man who had pulled her free when she was trapped in the narrow crack.\n Her motion attracted Khalid\u0027s eye. He spoke to her, pointing a thumb toward Villanueva. \"Is he feverish? Is it the fungal poison? Why is he acting like that?\" He waved her away from the SEAL. \"Be careful. He may be dangerous.\"\n Numbly, she watched as her feet started stepping toward Khalid. \"He\u0027s fine. It\u0027s just that he doesn\u0027t understand why you have explosives.\"\n \"Get away from him!\" Villanueva struggled to stand but was too weak and unstable. He toppled back down. \"Don\u0027t trust him. Give me the gun.\"\n Khalid turned to her. \"Don\u0027t. He\u0027ll kill me.\"\n She glanced toward the SEAL.\n Villanueva\u0027s lips were a cruel line. \"And what did you have planned for us with all these explosives?\"\n Khalid lowered his head. \"Linda, let me explain. He\u0027s twisting it all around. I\u0027m not some Arab terrorist. He\u0027s letting his prejudice delude him.\"\n \"Khalid…?\" She took a single step toward him, now only a few feet between them.\n \"Watch out!\"\n Villanueva\u0027s words were too slow. Much slower than the sudden speed of Khalid\u0027s leap. He was upon her before she could gasp. He held her in a tight hug. One hand reached down and freed the gun from her trapped hand.\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" he whispered in her ear. \"It wasn\u0027t supposed to be like this.\" With the gun in his hand, he released her.\n She stumbled a few steps away, tears pooling in her eyes.\n He pointed the gun at Villanueva.\n \"So now what, Khalid?\" he said with a sneer. \"How do you think you\u0027re gonna get out of here?\"\n \"By lightening the load.\" He pulled the trigger twice. Villanueva\u0027s head bounced back, two small holes appearing in his forehead. His body slumped to the floor.\n Linda screamed. Covering her face, she dropped to her knees, sobbing, expecting at any moment to feel bullets ripping into her too.\n A hand touched her shoulder. No words.\n She cringed from his touch and continued crying. The hand did not try to touch her again. Eventually her wracking cries dissolved to a simple flow of tears. She glanced up.\n Khalid sat on his haunches, hanging his head. The gun still rested in his hand, as comfortable and easy as a pen. He must have noticed her look.\n She sniffed. \"Why?\"\n His words were dry, unemotional. \"I was assigned this mission.\" Khalid shifted to face her. \"Blakely was naive. News of his discovery of a huge diamond statue reached many ears. A South African diamond cartel approached my employer. If the source of such huge diamonds were ever discovered, it would destroy the diamond market. Current prices would plummet. I was assigned to find the source of the diamonds, then sabotage the site. Explode the entire system.\"\n She lowered her head. \"All those deaths just for money.\"\n He reached over and tipped her face toward him, his fingertips warm from the hot gun. \"No,\" he said. \"I accepted this assignment from the South Africans for another reason too. One closer to my heart. Like the diamond market, if this continent should open up as a major oil competitor, it could devastate the Middle East economy. Oil is my country\u0027s lifeblood. Before oil, my country was poor. No education, no health care, no way out of the sand. I will not see that happen again. Not after so much progress.\" A flash of pain in his eyes. \"I care for my country as much as you do yours. Would you kill to save your country?\"\n Unsure herself, she did not answer, only turned her face away.\n Releasing his grip on her chin, he stood up. \"I need to head back up. Complete my mission.\" He walked to Villanueva\u0027s body. \"He had to be killed. His knowledge was a threat to my mission. But… you… I need. Another pair of eyes, another pair of hands. It\u0027s a long journey back up.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/subterranean/page-35.html","bookId":1526,"book":{"id":1526,"title":"Subterranean","description":"Storyline: \n Travel to the bottom of the earth to a place you never dreamed existed.
