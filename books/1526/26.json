From this vantage point, he had a view of the entire open area. His hand lantern rested in a crevice nearby, illuminating the area ahead but leaving him in shadow.\\n\\n He raised his rifle and waited, counting each heartbeat. The cavern was quiet as a tomb. Then a soft snuffling arose, followed by a blast of angry hissing. Big Bertha stepped into the circle of light, cautious, head low. She darted forward. Damn, she moved fast. Within a single twitch of an eye, she had jumped to the center of the clearing, drawn by the shiny object. The two others, younger it seemed, slinked in behind her. She picked up the bundle of rifle shells Ben had taped together.\\n\\n Ben rested his cheek against his rifle butt, eyeing his sight lines. He allowed a small smile to come to his lips. Curiosity kills.\\n\\n Bertha raised the shells to her nose, sniffing at them. Ben targeted the bundle and pulled the trigger. Upon impact, a thunderous explosion rocked the cavern.\\n\\n Where Bertha\u0027s right arm had once been, now only a bloody stump remained, waving plumes of black blood. Her snout was now a ruin of bone and gristle. She teetered, then crashed to the floor, thrashing in death throes.\\n\\n Panicked, the others jumped away, one leaping atop a high boulder. They screamed at each other, whipping their tails angrily. Taking advantage of their confusion, Ben slipped from his hiding place, grabbed his flashlight, and ran.\\n\\n That should keep them distracted for a while… he hoped. He pounded away at a dead sprint. He needed five minutes. Then he would be far enough ahead. After ten yards, he spared one look over his shoulder. Two reptilian heads stared in his direction. No longer hissing at each other. They had figured out his ruse and knew who to blame.\\n\\n Turning forward, he willed his legs to move faster. A quick glance backward showed the heads had vanished.\\n\\n The chase was on.\\n\\n Ashley stared at the pouch of the beast. \"So it\u0027s some sort of marsupial? How could that be?\"\\n\\n Linda shrugged. \"All manner of marsupial species existed. At one time, they filled every environmental niche: predator, prey, et cetera. I\u0027d say this is an early prototype. Something that eventually died on the evolutionary vine. Even if-\"\\n\\n Suddenly the sound of approaching movement intruded.\\n\\n Ashley snapped her head around. Several yards away, a single lantern, bobbing erratically, appeared around a boulder. Ashley flashed her light in its direction.\\n\\n Michaelson, limping with a pained expression, hobbled up to them.\\n\\n Ashley kept staring over his shoulder. \"Where\u0027s Ben?\"\\n\\n \"He was behind me, covering the rear.\" Michaelson turned a worried eye to the black cavern. \"But I haven\u0027t seen him or heard any rifle fire in a while. Just that loud explosion.\"\\n\\n \"So you just left him there? On his own?\"\\n\\n \"He insisted that-\"\\n\\n She stopped him with a raised palm. \"Later. Right now I want you two in the wormhole. We\u0027re too exposed sitting out here.\"\\n\\n Michaelson shook his head. \"I\u0027ll stay and cover the entrance until Ben gets here.\"\\n\\n \"No,\" Ashley said, eyeing his ankle. \"With your injury-I\u0027ll stand guard.\"\\n\\n Frowning, he obeyed her orders.\\n\\n Soon Ashley stood alone with a pistol in one hand and a flashlight in the other, her heartbeat so loud she was sure it could be heard across the cavern. C\u0027mon, Ben. Don\u0027t stand me up.\\n\\n From a distance down the wormhole, Michaelson called, \"Any sign of Ben?\"\\n\\n Ashley stood at the entrance. \"No. Just keep moving. I\u0027ll tell you when I see something.\" By now her palms were sweaty, her pistol slick in her grip. Ten minutes had already elapsed since Michaelson had arrived. Surely Ben should have been back by now. Her mind conjured up all kinds of horrors befalling Ben. Just get back here, she willed to him.\\n\\n Then, from across the open space, another lantern appeared, bouncing wildly. Thank god, she thought, raising her own light. Ben was running at a full gallop toward her. He threw his rifle over his shoulder and waved her away.\\n\\n \"Run!\" he yelled.\\n\\n From behind him, two huge bulks stalked into the open area, necks twisting back and forth as they spied their escaping prey.\\n\\n \"Get inside!\" he hollered to her.\\n\\n Panicked, she turned to obey, then stopped. How would Ben…? Whipping back around, she shoved her pistol into her belt, picked up his sled and yelled to him, \"Catch!\"\\n\\n She flung his board toward him and watched him snag the board in midair. Then she did the hardest thing in her life. She turned her back on Ben and dove headfirst into the wormhole.\\n\\n Holding her breath, she scooted down the shaft. Once she was a safe distance away, she braked to a stop and looked over her shoulder. From this angle, she could see Ben racing toward the entrance, a reptilian snout just over his shoulder. Hurry!\\n\\n He sprang for the hole, sled clutched to his chest. She cringed. He was going to miss the entrance and hit the wall.\\n\\n But instead he landed with a loud \"Ooof\" and dove smoothly into the tunnel.\\n\\n He made it! Unclenching her fists, she let out a long sigh.\\n\\n Bumping into her, Ben smiled, his expression both strained and relieved. \"Now, isn\u0027t this cozy.\"\\n\\n His rough hands held her legs. She wished those hands would wrap her up, hold her. Reaching back to him, she squeezed his hand.\\n\\n Suddenly the shaft was drowned in a scream of anger. One of the pursuers plunged its head down the hole toward them, its jaws open wide.\\n\\n Ben shoved her forward. \"Time to go!\"\\n\\n She started to sweep her hands forward, pulling farther away, when she heard a yelp from Ben. She twisted around.\\n\\n He was sliding away from her, back toward the entrance. The creature had snagged his boot and was hauling him back out. Ben kept kicking at its snout with his other heel.\\n\\n She flipped onto her back, sacrificing her sled, hearing it skitter down the shaft away from her, then snatched her pistol. \"Lay flat, Ben! Down!\"\\n\\n Eyeing the muzzle, Ben slammed flat, covering his head.\\n\\n Her hands clutched her gun, stone-steady. Over the hump of Ben\u0027s back, she spotted the eye within her sights, then pulled the trigger, the blast deafening within the tunnel.\\n\\n An echoing screech of pain instantly followed. Within a moment, Ben was rolling toward her again. Before she could react, his mouth was against hers. Their lips crushed together. He suddenly withdrew as if shocked himself. She blinked at him, her mouth still slightly parted.\\n\\n \"Damn,\" he said.\\n\\n \"Ouch!\" Ben shifted his hips beneath her. \"You\u0027re crushing me.\"\\n\\n Riding on Ben\u0027s back, she felt his muscles flexing beneath her as he drove their sled forward. Emotions warred within her: giddy relief at their close escape, trepidation for what lay ahead, and a rising lust for the man beneath her. \"Sorry,\" she said, scooting farther back, resting her head on his left shoulder, her hands at his waist. The heat from his body was like that of a furnace, steady and hot. She closed her eyes, allowing her cheek to brush against the nape of his neck.\\n\\n Ben said, \"I see lights up ahead.\"\\n\\n She raised her chin to look forward. \"It\u0027s the others. I told them to stay in the tunnel.\"\\n\\n They slid forward. Michaelson was last in line. He contorted his large bulk in the shaft as he turned toward them. He had a look of genuine relief on his face that was oddly touching.\\n\\n \"Jesus Christ,\" Michaelson said. \"You had us worried. First that scream and gunfire, then your empty sled slides down.\"\\n\\n \"We decided to carpool.\" Ben smiled. \"Saves gas and is good for the environment.\"\\n\\n Ashley pinched his waist, eliciting a pained expression from him. She craned her neck to look over Michaelson\u0027s head. \"How\u0027s Villanueva?\"\\n\\n \"Groggy still, but stable. Breathing evenly now. Strong pulse.\"\\n\\n \"Good. Then let\u0027s pause here. Try to contact Alpha Base. Can you reach the radio?\"\\n\\n Michaelson nodded. \"I already tried.\"\\n\\n \"And?\"\\n\\n \"Only static.\"\\n\\n She wrinkled her brow. If they couldn\u0027t contact someone, get some help… \"Maybe we\u0027re too confined here. All this rock.\"\\n\\n \"No, it shouldn\u0027t make any difference. Down here, we\u0027re always surrounded by rock.\"\\n\\n \"Then what\u0027s the matter? Is the radio damaged?\"\\n\\n \"No, it checked out fine, and the communications center at the base is staffed around the clock. For them not to have responded…\" His words stumbled to a stop.\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n \"Something damned serious must be going down.\"\\n\\n SIXTEEN\\n\\n \"RUN,\" BLAKELY SAID, PUSHING JASON FROM BEHIND.\\n\\n \"To my office.\"\\n\\n \"But-\"\\n\\n \"Hurry!\"\\n\\n Blakely raced for his office, passing the boy and dragging him by the arm. Thankfully, Jason, still shocked by the commotion, allowed himself to be towed.\\n\\n Sirens wailed in Blakely\u0027s ears, making it difficult to think. Men and women raced about them. A thousand floodlights swung in wild arcs across the rooftop. From the sounds of gunfire, the assault was striking the base periphery from all sides.\\n\\n Blakely pounded up the steps of the administration building. Jason stumbled after him, his gym bag strap tangling around his feet. Once through the door and down the hall, they burst into Blakely\u0027s private office.\\n\\n Roland was stuffing papers into a briefcase by the handful. He didn\u0027t look up as he spoke. \"I heard. Almost ready.\"\\n\\n \"Good. Make sure you get the research documents in my desk drawer too. Those military assholes might take my base, but I\u0027ll be damned if they\u0027re going to get my work.\"\\n\\n \"Why the alarms?\" Roland asked. \"What\u0027s going on?\"\\n\\n He ran a hand through his thinning hair. \"It\u0027s a full base alert. I have a feeling-\"\\n\\n A huge explosion rocked the building. Jason hugged his gym bag tighter to his chest. Tears started to well.\\n\\n Roland began shoving papers faster. \"That sounded like the munitions dump on the south side.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/subterranean/page-26.html","bookId":1526,"book":{"id":1526,"title":"Subterranean","description":"Storyline: Travel to the bottom of the earth to a place you never dreamed existed.
