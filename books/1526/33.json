He had reached the lip of the cliff! With renewed energy, she followed, scrambling from handhold to handhold.\n Suddenly Ben\u0027s face popped over the lip, only feet from her. He wore a huge smile. \"C\u0027mon. What\u0027s keeping you?\"\n \"Just get out of my way,\" she said with a matching smile.\n He reached down and hooked a hand into her harness.\n \"I can manage on my own. Just-\"\n He yanked her up to him, kissing her squarely on the lips, then rolled backward, hauling her over the edge and on top of him.\n She laughed convulsively as she lay sprawled across his chest. Relief at finally surmounting the cliff washed over her. Ben\u0027s nose was only inches from hers. But he wasn\u0027t laughing-only staring into her eyes. His seriousness sobered her.\n There was a hunger in his stare, a desire she had never seen so openly offered. And in his eyes, a question. As she stared, her laughter died in her throat. Restraining for only a heartbeat, she answered his question, leaning down and returning his kiss, at first gently, then with a passion that had been too long suppressed.\n In response, he wrapped his arms around her, swallowing her up, enveloping her deeper to him, bodies crushing together as fervently as their lips.\n Words intruded: \"If you lovebirds are done, I could use a hand.\"\n Blushing furiously, Ashley rolled off Ben and sat up.\n Michaelson, with the biggest backpack, struggled to pull himself up over the edge. Ben scooted over and by pulling on his pack was able to wrestle the major up.\n Michaelson shoved to his feet. \"Well, we\u0027re up here now. But where the hell is here?\"\n Clearing her throat, Ashley shot Ben a guilty glance. They should have been checking out the site. She unclasped her hand lantern and clicked it on. The men followed her example. \"Let\u0027s find out,\" she said.\n Ben freed the geopositional compass from his pack and fiddled with it. \"Still not working.\" He snapped it closed and rummaged through his pack. \"Forget all that newfangled computer crap. Sometimes you have to resort to old-fashioned methods.\" He pulled out a scratched silver box the size of his palm and kissed it. \"Ah! Here\u0027s my darling. Simple magnetic compass with built-in barometer for measuring pressure. Great for approximating depth.\" He studied the tiny tool\u0027s measurements. \"I\u0027d estimate we\u0027ve just climbed two hundred meters. Bringing us just that much closer to home.\" He pointed the compass forward. \"We should head this way.\"\n Ashley took the lead, Michaelson limping behind her.\n Ahead of them, the surrounding rock opened into a spacious cavern, a short rise blocking the view into the main chamber. Leading, Ashley reached the crest first. She froze as she waved her light across the cavern floor ahead.\n Ben tromped up beside her. \"Shit!\" he said as he looked down.\n \"Goddamn,\" Michaelson whispered.\n Ashley widened her lantern beam. Before them, strewn across the cavern floor, lay thousands of white eggs the size of ripe watermelons. Most were clustered into distinct groups. Nests. Several patches of cracked empty shells dotted the field. Halfway across the cavern, three immature marsupial creatures, about the size of small ponies, huddled together, necks entwining. As Ashley\u0027s beam settled upon them, they began a strident mewling.\n Linda was right, Ashley thought. Egg-laying, like the platypus. \"This is not good,\" Ashley said. \"Not good at all.\"\n Only one other passage exited the chamber. A tunnel large enough for a train to pass through. The babies\u0027 cries continued, grating like a fingernail scraped across a blackboard. The trio quieted, cowering in their nest, when a bellow erupted from the tunnel ahead.\n Something large and angry barreled this way.\n EIGHTEEN\n LEANING OVER THE GREEN PONTOON, JASON WATCHED the triangular wake his fingers made in the water. He wished his mother were here. Not that he was scared. Actually, the initial terror of their escape yesterday had dulled to a mere worry. He just missed her.\n Behind him, Blakely snored, slumped in his seat. For nearly a day they had anchored here, a hundred yards offshore. Nothing to do, nothing to see. A smoky pall obscured the shoreline. Yesterday, brief explosions of fire had brightened the water\u0027s edge. Today, though, nothing but oily smoke and darkness. It was hard to tell in which direction the base even lay. Just walls of emptiness, like they were adrift in space.\n Jason rolled onto his back. A buckle on his orange life jacket gouged his side. He squiggled into a more comfortable position, studying the world above him. The single lantern cast a splash of illumination toward the ceiling. Poking through the black mist, stalactites pointed down to the boat. Like they were pointing at him. Even as the boat drifted, the rocky spears seemed to bend and continue to accuse him, before finally disappearing into the smoke.\n Jason sat up suddenly, rocking the boat. Wait a minute. They were anchored. The boat shouldn\u0027t be gliding past stalactites. They were moving! Drifting!\n \"Dr. Blakely!\" Jason crawled across the bouncy floor to the doctor. \"Something\u0027s wrong.\"\n Blakely groaned and pushed back into his seat. \"Now what, Jason? Did you see another fish?\" He straightened his glasses, one lens of which had been knocked out sometime yesterday. He kept squinting the unprotected eye, almost like he was winking.\n \"Look up, Dr. Blakely! We\u0027re moving.\"\n Sighing, Blakely craned his neck back, his lip cemented in a disapproving line. Then his expression jumped to a startled look, both eyes wide. \"Damn, we are moving.\"\n Blakely reached over the side and began hauling the anchor\u0027s line, tossing dripping loops of rope onto Jason\u0027s toes.\n Jason nudged the slimy, smelly loops away with a scowl.\n \"Damn!\" Blakely held up the frayed end of the rope. No anchor. \"Looks like something chewed through it.\" He dropped the end of the rope and sat down by the rudder. \"The current\u0027s strong here. We\u0027re moving at a fair clip.\"\n \"What are we going to do?\"\n Blakely crossed to the motor. \"First, we need to find out where we\u0027re heading. Jason, go to the front and turn on the searchlamp.\"\n Jason scooted to the prow of the boat, grabbed the handle of the lamp, thumbed the switch, and swung the beam forward. A thick blade of light shredded the darkness ahead. But the smoke fought it to a standstill. An endless shroud of oily mist blocked the light only yards from the prow.\n \"Jason, why don\u0027t you free those oars? We may need to paddle.\"\n \"Why? We could just use the motor.\"\n Blakely shook his head. \"There\u0027s not much gas in the engine. And with the smoke this thick, it would be suicide to go too fast. We could barrel right into something or into shore. And besides, if we\u0027re close to shore-and who the hell could tell in this pea soup?-I don\u0027t want to draw attention. So let\u0027s paddle.\"\n Nodding, Jason locked the light in position and slipped to where the two plastic paddles were housed. As he was lifting one free of its berth, Blakely suddenly swore. Jason glanced up.\n A wall of jagged rock raced toward them, stretching wide ahead of them. Black daggers jutted from the walls and water. The current was aiming their boat right for the thickest cluster of sharpened stone. Suddenly floating on big rubber balloons seemed a stupid way to travel.\n Blakely yelled while he leaned his full weight on the rudder. \"Boy, get on the right side and paddle like mad!\"\n Jason understood the danger and flew to the right side, lunging over the pontoon to plant his paddle. He pulled as his mother had once showed him while canoeing down the Colorado River. He dug deep with the blade of the paddle, making his strokes long and fast.\n \"We\u0027re not going to make it,\" Blakely yelled, each word louder than the last.\n The note of panic in his voice was contagious. Jason\u0027s studied paddling grew frantic. He concentrated on the water he was churning. Still he kept listening, blood pounding in his ears, expecting to hear at any moment the rip of shredded pontoon.\n His shoulders burned with the strain, but he kept digging with his paddle.\n \"We\u0027re turning!\" Blakely\u0027s voice had an edge of hope.\n Jason glanced over his shoulder. The boat was now running at an angle toward the wall, rather than straight. He continued pulling with his paddle. \"Get the motor started!\" he yelled.\n \"Not enough time. I don\u0027t dare let go of the rudder.\"\n Jason had been on enough canoe trips to know that they weren\u0027t going to make it. Still he wrestled with his paddle. Then, through the smoke ahead, an opening appeared in the wall as their boat angled to the side. A wide black mouth. If they could aim for that, maybe they could miss the jagged wall.\n Blakely saw it too. \"It\u0027s our only chance.\"\n Jason dug savagely. Luckily, the current aimed for the hole too. As he worked the paddle, the prow of the boat crept deeper into the current.\n \"Watch your head!\" Blakely called out.\n Jason ducked as a shelf of rocky overhang passed over the boat. They were about to hit the wall! He crouched low in the boat, anticipating the collision. But the strength of the flow suddenly grabbed the boat and pulled the prow around the bend and into the black tunnel.\n \"We did it,\" Jason said.\n They glided smoothly into the tunnel. Jason crawled forward to the light at the prow. He swiveled it about, examining the walls. No rocky spars awaited to jab them. Instead the walls were glassy smooth.\n \"It looks safe,\" Blakely said. \"This is the river that drains the lake. Luckily for us, the years of running water have polished these walls.\" His words echoed, giving them a hollow feeling.\n The river carried the boat deeper into the tunnel. The light pierced the tunnel to a bend ahead. \"Where does it go?\" Jason asked.\n \"I don\u0027t know, and I don\u0027t think this is a good time to explore. Let\u0027s see if we can swing the boat around, and I\u0027ll get the motor running.\"\n Jason passed Blakely a paddle and each took a side. Jason paddled forward while the doctor backpaddled. The boat began to turn on its axis just as the current passed around a bend in the tunnel. The river beyond the curve suddenly dropped at a steep slope. The increased speed of the flow ripped the prow of the boat forward again. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/subterranean/page-33.html","bookId":1526,"book":{"id":1526,"title":"Subterranean","description":"Storyline: \n Travel to the bottom of the earth to a place you never dreamed existed.
