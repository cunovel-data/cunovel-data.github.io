But you must understand. If you come along and betray my secret, then I will be forced to kill again.\" He held a hand out to her. \"Can I trust you?\"\n Linda stared at his calloused palm. To go with him, he might turn on her as swiftly as he had turned on Villanueva. But to stay alone down here, unarmed, meant certain death.\n Wrapping her arms around her body, Linda ignored his hand and made a decision. \"I\u0027ll go with you.\"\n Thank God, Michaelson thought, as Ben stopped in front of him. He steadied himself with a hand on the Aussie\u0027s shoulder, the crude splint on his ankle biting into his calf. The half-assed contraption had been hurriedly slapped on his leg after climbing back to the nest area. Walking was possible, but slow and wobbly. Michaelson winced when he saw how far they still had to go to reach the nursery\u0027s exit.\n \"Did you hear something?\" Ben asked, his head cocked to the side.\n Ashley shook her head. Michaelson listened.\n From several yards behind, the infant marsupial predators hissed at the group, tiny crests twitching up and down. Their protests had become less strident as they became aware that the group was leaving the nest. Still the tunnel was some distance away, a black slash in the wall.\n \"No,\" Michaelson said. \"Nothing. Sounds clear.\"\n Ben nodded, using a finger to clear an ear. \"I could have sworn…\" He proceeded forward.\n Michaelson followed, his steps clumsy on his bad ankle.\n Ashley stepped up beside him. \"How are you holding up?\"\n \"Fine, but I still think you should proceed without me. I\u0027m holding you up.\"\n She frowned. \"It\u0027s best if we go slowly anyway. No telling what lies ahead.\"\n Resigned, he tromped after Ben, keeping an eye on the tunnel entrance. A goal. He began counting his steps, each odd numeral painful as he hopped his weight on his splinted ankle.\n On his thirty-third step, he finally reached the opening. He leaned on the wall of the tunnel, perspiration soaking his forehead. A stitch of pain had started throbbing on his right side. Damn it, must have cracked a rib too, he thought, rubbing a hand over his side.\n Ben stepped up to him. He had reconnoitered the passage ahead while waiting for Michaelson to hobble up. He glanced at where Michaelson rubbed and raised an eyebrow, but thankfully didn\u0027t ask any questions. It was already embarrassing enough to have the Aussie pull his butt out of the fire when that enraged creature had caught him up. If it wasn\u0027t for Ben\u0027s foolish stunt, he would have been dead by now.\n He dropped his hand from his side. \"What did you find?\"\n \"It\u0027s a bloody maze down there. Passages crisscrossing every which way. Some lighted by fungus, some clear. We need to be careful.\"\n \"At least we have plenty of escape routes.\"\n \"Yeah, but which passage gets us out of here?\"\n \"There\u0027s only one way to find out.\" Suppressing a wince, he pointed down the tunnel. \"After you.\"\n Ben flashed his light forward and entered the tunnel. After several yards of careful progress, Michaelson realized Ben\u0027s description of the passages ahead was an un- derstatement. The first intersection had five rocky passages sprouting in all directions.\n \"Now which way?\" Ben asked, his question directed at Ashley.\n Michaelson hopped forward, irritated that Ben should exclude him from the decision-making process. Even if he was an invalid, he was still the senior military presence here. Their safety was still his primary responsibility.\n Ashley pointed to each of the tunnels with a beam of light. She settled her light on one of the passages. \"This passage seems to be heading up. And it has some of that glowing mold on the wall.\"\n Michaelson peered down the tunnel selected. He made a noncommittal grunt.\n Ashley looked at him. \"The mold will allow us to conserve batteries. We still don\u0027t know how far we have to travel before we find our way out of this hellhole, so we better think conservation. Try to stick to lighted passage-ways as much as possible. Besides, the more light around us, the safer I feel.\"\n Michaelson nodded. As much as it grated on him, her assessment of the situation was sound. He couldn\u0027t have planned any better. \"Let\u0027s go, then,\" he said.\n Ben took the point again. He turned his light to a weak diffuse setting, just enough to highlight some of the blacker nooks and crannies. Otherwise, the thickening mold added sufficient glow to see by. Ben waved them to turn off their lights, including their helmet lamps.\n Michaelson followed Ben. Ashley covered their rear, pistol in hand. Michaelson ground his molars, both from the pain and his frustration with his physical shape. He should be guarding their retreat or sweeping ahead for dangers. Not sandwiched in the middle like some sheltered mama\u0027s boy.\n Still, he couldn\u0027t argue with the order of their procession. Ben had already skipped several yards ahead while Michaelson hobbled to keep up. Glancing behind him, balanced on his good foot, he watched Ashley check the passage behind her. She swung forward and caught him staring at her. She smiled weakly at him, almost like she was trying to reassure him.\n Pinching his brows together angrily, he increased the pace of his hopping. Side passages and crossways flew past. He didn\u0027t try to memorize his route, only kept his eyes fixed on Ben\u0027s back, struggling to match his pace. As much as his hot blood drove him forward, past the pain, past his incapacitation, eventually his feverish pace dwindled back again to a pathetic crawl. Ben disappeared around a bend in the corridor. Panting now, sparks of lights danced across Michaelson\u0027s vision; pain shot in electric bolts from his ankle.\n He stopped, leaning on the wall, his side now burning with a hot flame.\n Ashley stepped to his shoulder, her voice a mixture of concern and anger. \"Quit pushing yourself. We\u0027re not in a race. Careful progress is what will get us out of here.\"\n \"I\u0027m slowing you up,\" he said between pain-clenched teeth.\n Ben\u0027s face suddenly appeared in front of him. Damn, that Aussie moved silently when he wanted to. Ben wore a concerned expression.\n Michaelson glared at Ben. \"I\u0027m fine.\" He dared him to argue.\n \"That\u0027s good,\" said Ben, his voice an urgent whisper, \"because I think we\u0027re being stalked.\"\n Ashley crossed next to Ben. \"What do you mean?\"\n \"I keep hearing something scraping and shuffling in neighboring passages. Keeping pace with us.\"\n \"Maybe they\u0027re just echoes of our own progress,\" Ashley said, but her eyes darted behind her. \"I haven\u0027t heard anything.\" She glanced at Michaelson. \"Have you?\"\n He shook his head, but he was no judge. All he could hear when he moved was his own wheezing pants and his heart pounding in his ears. Hell, he hadn\u0027t even heard Ben approach until he was on top of him.\n Ben hissed his words. \"You\u0027ve got to know what to listen for. I know noises that are natural for a cave. And these aren\u0027t normal.\"\n \"So what do we do?\" Ashley asked.\n \"We need to shake this tail, but it knows these passages better than we do. Our only hope is speed. Outrun it.\"\n Michaelson was very conscious that Ben didn\u0027t glance his way. Ashley didn\u0027t either, but an uncomfortable silence descended like a weight upon them. He knew what they were thinking. They needed to move quickly but wouldn\u0027t leave him behind.\n Rolling his eyes, he started to speak when he heard it too. They all did. Six eyes turned in unison to their back trail. Something scraped rock behind them, out of sight, followed by the sound of a single pebble displaced and bouncing. Something was back there.\n \"Leave me,\" he said. He pulled his pistol and pointed it. Not down the trail but at Ashley and Ben. \"Now.\"\n \"Quit that shit,\" Ben said. \"We\u0027re not in some damned Rambo movie. We know you\u0027re not gonna shoot us.\"\n \"I won\u0027t allow my injuries to get us all killed.\" He raised the barrel to his own temple, pressing the cold muzzle to his heated skin. \"Go or I\u0027ll shoot.\"\n \"Michaelson…\" Ashley\u0027s voice was tight with fear. \"We\u0027re a team.\"\n \"Go. I\u0027ll cover the back trail for as long as possible.\"\n \"No!\" Ashley said. \"You\u0027re coming with us.\"\n \"Go.\" He cocked the pistol with his thumb. \"Now. Or in three seconds you\u0027ll have no one to cover your escape.\"\n He watched Ashley swallow hard and glance at Ben for help. If either rushed him, he would pull the trigger. He knew he needed to force them to leave him behind. A second pebble tripped somewhere behind them.\n Ben turned to Ashley, the stubborn set of his shoulders slumped. \"He\u0027s right. We\u0027ve got to think of the others. If we don\u0027t reach help, they\u0027ll all die too.\"\n Ashley\u0027s fists clenched, her knuckles white. \"I hate this.\"\n Ben rested a hand on her shoulder. He turned his eyes to Michaelson. \"I know you\u0027re keen on this suicide mission. Kamikaze and all that. But up five yards ahead is a small alcove with a tiny pool of water. It\u0027s large enough to hide three Marines in there. I suggest you hole up. It\u0027ll be a secure spot to keep out of sight and offers good coverage if you need to shoot.\"\n Michaelson nodded, suspicious. \"Go. I\u0027ll check it later.\"\n Ben pulled Ashley away. \"C\u0027mon. Maybe we can lead the pursuers away from him.\"\n She allowed herself to be shifted away, but not before her eyes locked on the major\u0027s one final time, tears at the corners of her lids. \"Dennis, be careful. Don\u0027t do anything stupid.\"\n He waved her away with the muzzle of the gun. He watched her twist around and leave with Ben\u0027s arm around her. They disappeared around the bend without a glance behind. He listened as their footfalls faded down the tunnel until there was only silence. He listened carefully, ears straining, making sure they had definitely left, as well as trying to hear any telltale sound of the stalkers.\n He heard nothing other than his own pulse throbbing at his temples. He continued to wait. Still after nearly an hour, nothing appeared or was even heard. Maybe Ben had been panicked over nothing, but he couldn\u0027t convince himself. Ben was too wise in cave lore to be fooled by an echo or natural noises. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/subterranean/page-36.html","bookId":1526,"book":{"id":1526,"title":"Subterranean","description":"Storyline: \n Travel to the bottom of the earth to a place you never dreamed existed.
