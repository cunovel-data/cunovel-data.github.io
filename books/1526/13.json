By the time Ben had wiped the gravy off his plate with a slice of sourdough and patted his belly with a sigh, she still had no idea what to say. To hell with \"proper\" words.\\n\\n Ashley cleared her throat. \"I\u0027d… like to… make a toast.\" She raised her water glass and stood up. The others looked at her expectantly. \"Over the past few days, we\u0027ve all had a lot thrown at us. And I think we\u0027re all feeling trampled on, but tomorrow we embark on a trip where the success of our mission will depend on our ability to work as a team. And as much as Blakely may get under my skin personally, I think he put a hell of a team together. So,\" she said, raising her glass higher, \"here\u0027s to us. To the team.\"\\n\\n \"To the team!\" the group echoed, hoisting their drinks.\\n\\n \"Yeah, to you guys!\" Jason said, swigging from his cola.\\n\\n Linda tousled his hair. \"What about us girls?\"\\n\\n Jason blushed. \"You know what I meant.\"\\n\\n \"I know.\" Linda leaned over and kissed him on the cheek. \"Thanks.\"\\n\\n Jason turned an uncomfortable shade of purple.\\n\\n As Ashley smiled at her son\u0027s consternation, she felt a tap on her shoulder. Ben stood behind her. He leaned and whispered in her ear. \"I\u0027d like to talk to you. Would you mind a short walk after dinner?\"\\n\\n \"Umm…\" she hedged, caught off guard. This was the last thing she had expected. \"I\u0027ve got to put Jason to bed.\"\\n\\n \"Well, how about after that? I just need a few moments.\"\\n\\n \"Is it important? Can\u0027t it wait until morning?\"\\n\\n \"Well, I\u0027d rather get this off my chest tonight.\"\\n\\n \"Sure,\" she agreed reluctantly, \"I guess I can see you in a bit. How\u0027s half an hour?\"\\n\\n \"Fine. I\u0027ll meet you outside the entrance. I\u0027m gonna fetch a jacket.\"\\n\\n She nodded and watched him leave. \"Jason, let\u0027s head back up to our room.\"\\n\\n Her son, more his normal shade now that Linda\u0027s attention had turned to Khalid, pushed back his chair with a loud squeak. \"Can I watch cable?\"\\n\\n \"Sure, but only for a half hour, then to bed.\" She collected him under her arm, squeezing him, and waved to the other two. \"See you in the morning.\"\\n\\n Linda waved back, and Khalid nodded.\\n\\n After settling Jason in front of a rerun of Gilligan\u0027s Island, Ashley pulled on a yellow sweater. \"I\u0027ll be back in a little bit.\"\\n\\n Jason waved to her as she left, his eyes never leaving the screen.\\n\\n Ashley pushed through the door to the outside and spotted Ben talking to a guard. He waved to the Marine and crossed over to her. \"Thanks for coming.\"\\n\\n She wrapped her arms around her chest. \"So?\"\\n\\n \"How about we walk over to that gorge?\" He pointed toward the opposite end of camp. \"I\u0027ve heard the area is a bonzer make-out spot.\"\\n\\n She placed her fists on her hips. \"If you think… That\u0027s not why I came out here.\"\\n\\n Ben grinned at her. \"I\u0027m just teasing.\"\\n\\n \"Then what did you want to talk about?\"\\n\\n \"C\u0027mon. Let\u0027s walk. I really want to see this chasm. I barely caught sight of it when we crossed yesterday.\" He offered his arm. \"C\u0027mon.\"\\n\\n She ignored the arm and walked past him. \"I can\u0027t be away too long. Jason\u0027s waiting up.\"\\n\\n He caught up and strode beside her. \"About this afternoon-\"\\n\\n She held up a hand. \"I know, I know. I overreacted.\"\\n\\n \"No, not at all, I was being a jackass.\"\\n\\n She turned to him. \"Is that what you think?\"\\n\\n \"Sure do. I was butting my big nose where it doesn\u0027t belong.\"\\n\\n She studied his serious eyes and determined jaw, limned in the lantern light of a nearby tent. \"See,\" she said, a tightness in her throat thickening her words, \"that\u0027s what\u0027s really bothering me.\"\\n\\n \"What?\" He brushed a hand across hers, but she pulled away.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m supposed to be the big leader here. Guiding and motivating the team. But a simple question sends me ballistic. Some leader I make.\" Her voice cracked a bit.\\n\\n \"Hey, don\u0027t beat yourself up.\" He reached out farther and clasped her hand, his touch igniting her like an electric shock. She made a weak attempt to pull away, but he held her too firmly. \"Listen, Ash, you were pressed for time. Hell, you only had a single day to explore the ruins, and I had to distract you with stupid questions.\"\\n\\n \"Your questions weren\u0027t stupid. My response was.\" She tried to draw her hand free, but as she pulled, he stepped closer. \"I…\" How brightly his eyes reflected the lantern\u0027s light. \"I… think we\u0027d better continue with our walk.\" She finally freed her hand.\\n\\n \"Yeah…\" He glanced away from her. \"You\u0027re right.\"\\n\\n They continued across the camp in silence.\\n\\n The quiet soon became painful. \"You know,\" she said, \"now that I\u0027ve had time to think about it… what really ticked me off this afternoon was that you were right.\"\\n\\n \"About what?\"\\n\\n \"The statue. For now, it is not that vital to know in which direction the statue was facing. Sometimes I get so fixated on the details that I miss the bigger picture. And when you brought this to my attention, I lashed out. I\u0027m sorry.\"\\n\\n \"Hey, you were under a lot of pressure. Besides, I like people who speak their mind.\"\\n\\n She smiled.\\n\\n \"People like you,\" he said in a whisper.\\n\\n \"Thanks, Ben.\" They rounded a Quonset hut, and a black gash split the ground ahead. To the left, a lighted bridge crossed the gorge.\\n\\n As soon as they stepped into the lighted area, a guard called to them from the bridge. \"Stop right there.\" The gun pointed toward them punctuated his statement. \"This area is restricted.\"\\n\\n \"My, my,\" Ben whispered in an aside to her as a second guard approached. \"I can see why everyone thinks this is a romantic spot.\"\\n\\n The stone-faced guard checked their identification cards. \"You\u0027re clear.\" He turned to the other guard by the bridge and gave him a thumbs-up sign. \"Sorry for the scare, but we\u0027re tightening security.\"\\n\\n \"Why?\" she asked.\\n\\n \"Sorry, ma\u0027am. That\u0027s classified information.\" He turned and proceeded toward the bridge.\\n\\n Ashley turned to Ben. \"What do you make of that?\"\\n\\n He shrugged. \"Who can figure the military? Bunch of buffoons.\"\\n\\n \"I know. I wouldn\u0027t mind pushing the lot of them into that damned chasm.\"\\n\\n \"Hey, what do you know? We do have something in common.\" He spun on a heel, very militarylike, to head back to the dormitory. He offered his arm.\\n\\n This time she took him up on his offer.\\n\\n Blakely stretched, leaning away from the console. He glanced at a clock on the wall. A few minutes after midnight. Now, that was cutting it down to the wire. The team would be leaving in nine hours.\\n\\n \"All green lights,\" said a voice behind him. \"Finally.\"\\n\\n He turned to the head of communications, Lieutenant Brian Flattery. \"I knew those new circuit boards would do the trick,\" the doctor said. \"With the communications net intact, we\u0027ll be able to communicate to my team anywhere on the planet.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s good,\" said Flattery. \"But still…\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t fret. This time it\u0027ll be different.\"\\n\\n Flattery glanced at the floor. \"We never found Wombley\u0027s body. Only that splat of blood.\"\\n\\n \"I know, I know.\"\\n\\n \"And there\u0027s still no word from the other team. It\u0027s been four months. And what about the recent disappearance of the guard by the chasm?\"\\n\\n Blakely held up a hand. He had heard similar rumblings across the camp. \"We\u0027re prepared this time. We\u0027ll be in regular communication.\"\\n\\n \"Shouldn\u0027t this group be forewarned of the risk they\u0027re taking?\"\\n\\n Blakely shrugged. \"Major Michaelson and his two men know. That\u0027s what\u0027s important. I guess I\u0027m going to have to give the rest of the team some details, but they don\u0027t need to know everything. This time we\u0027re proceeding with foreknowledge of the risks. We\u0027re properly armed.\"\\n\\n \"We don\u0027t really know that.\"\\n\\n Blakely squinted at the line of green lights on the communications console. He tapped one light that fluttered. It stabilized to a steady green. \"Nothing to worry about.\"\\n\\n BOOK THREE\\n\\n Chutes and Ladders\\n\\n TEN\\n\\n THE PACK WAS HEAVY, THE CUSHIONED STRAPS CUTTING into Ashley\u0027s shoulders. She shrugged it off and set it down at her feet. Heavy, but manageable. She saw Linda grimace as she tried to adjust her own backpack over her shoulders. Ashley reached over and tugged the bag higher on Linda\u0027s back. \"Carry it like that and it won\u0027t be so bad.\"\\n\\n Linda smiled, but creases of worry still etched her brow. \"Thanks. I just have to get accustomed to it.\"\\n\\n Ashley nodded. We all do, she thought.\\n\\n Ashley led Linda toward the group clustered near the team\u0027s radio. Blakely was explaining its operation to Ben, Khalid, and Major Michaelson. \"Our web of receivers and transmitters operates at an ultra-low frequency. They\u0027re buried and spread out, so we will be able to communicate through hundreds of miles of rock in all directions.\"\\n\\n Major Michaelson hefted the radio, testing its weight. \"Sort of like the buried transmitters that guide our submarines.\"\\n\\n \"Exactly the same principle. Low-level reverberations. The system has been tested and checks out fine.\"\\n\\n \"How often do we establish contact?\" Ashley asked as she stepped up.\\n\\n \"Three times a day. At the designated hours,\" Blakely responded. He pointed at the radio. \"This is the most important piece of equipment you\u0027ll be carrying.\"\\n\\n Major Michaelson tapped his pistol at his waist. \"This is my most important piece of equipment.\"\\n\\n Ben snorted. \"You\u0027re both wrong. Shows your lack of caving experience.\" He pointed to his belt with its ring of batteries. \"This is your most important piece of equipment. Without batteries, you have no light. Without light, you can\u0027t see what you\u0027re shooting at and no radio in the world is going to guide your ass out of a hole.\" He gripped his battery belt. \"This is your lifeblood down here.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/subterranean/page-13.html","bookId":1526,"book":{"id":1526,"title":"Subterranean","description":"Storyline: Travel to the bottom of the earth to a place you never dreamed existed.
