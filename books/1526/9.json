Gets me my equipment.\" He pointed at the others, then at her. \"And it gets me a prime team.\"\\n\\n \"Still,\" she said, \"what\u0027s the final tradeoff for this exploration? If we end up with a strip-mined and blasted continent… that\u0027s too hefty a price tag. I can live without answering the mystery of the caverns.\"\\n\\n He stared at her, a sad look on his face. \"Can you really, Professor Carter?\"\\n\\n She opened her mouth to declare her convictions, but the lie would not come out. She had asked Blakely to be honest. Could she be any less? She remembered the diamond figurine, glowing in the last rays of the setting sun. She closed her mouth. Damn.\\n\\n He nodded and pointed down. \"Here it comes.\"\\n\\n Just then a breeze rushed into the cage, blowing back her parka hood. A warm breeze! At the same time, light burst up from below. The elevator had just dropped into the cavern.\\n\\n The ceiling of the cave, illuminated from below, dripped with damp stalactites, huge mountains hanging upside down. Several reached to the floor to form gigantic pillars. A natural colonnade. The elevator was descending beside a pillar twice the diameter of their own cage. Ashley noticed someone had scrawled graffiti on the column. An arrow pointing down with the rough-lettered words, \"Hell… one mile!\"\\n\\n Ben frowned. \"Defacing a cavern. That\u0027s not only poor taste, but among cavers it\u0027s considered bad luck.\"\\n\\n Blakely scowled at his assistant Roland. \"Let\u0027s get that removed-today.\"\\n\\n Ashley shook her head; droplets flew from the tip of her nose. She wiped her brow. Damp. The humidity must be close to a hundred percent. But the air! She inhaled deeply. It was so clean.\\n\\n She squinted, but the far wall was blocked by the massive pillar. Damn. She had hoped to spy the dwellings.\\n\\n \"Mom! Look!\" Jason pointed toward the cavern floor.\\n\\n Sighing in exasperation, she stood on tiptoe, leaning her forehead against the cold bars. Below, buildings and tents dotted the floor, lit by searchlights and festooned with lamps. A deep chasm, like a black wound, cut the base in two. A lighted bridge crossed the gap, linking the two halves. It was their destination.\\n\\n Alpha Base.\\n\\n \"Look over here,\" Linda exclaimed. \"You can see fish!\"\\n\\n Ashley sidled behind Linda, placing a hand on her shoulder, peering over and down.\\n\\n At the edge of Alpha Base, reflecting the lights of the camp, was a mammoth lake, covering several hundred acres, rippling gently. From above, a few glowing residents of the lake could be seen gliding and darting under the glassy surface. Strangely poetic.\\n\\n \"Cool,\" Jason exclaimed.\\n\\n \"And how, mate.\" Ben nudged Ashley with an elbow. \"Amazing, ain\u0027t it?\"\\n\\n Ashley nodded, her mind numb. Anxious to explore, her qualms from a moment ago were a dim memory. \"Am I remembering correctly? Did you say the cavern was five miles across?\\n\\n Blakely nodded, a smile playing about his lips. \"Approximately.\"\\n\\n Ben whistled.\\n\\n Within minutes, the cage settled to the cavern floor, secure in its berth. A uniformed escort stood ready to guide them to their quarters. Blakely faced the group. \"We\u0027re home!\"\\n\\n SEVEN\\n\\n Alpha Base, Antarctica\\n\\n ASHLEY WATCHED WITH A SMIRK AS JASON DARTED around his bedroom. Her own room in the two-bedroom suite was just as impressive. Hard to believe each member of the team had a separate suite in the main dormitory of the base. The perks of working on this mission were getting better and better. Lace curtains, walnut desks, thick upholstered chairs, designer wallpaper. Who would have thought they were two miles underground?\\n\\n \"Look, Mom.\" He pointed to a desk in the corner of his room. \"A real Pentium II. Not one of those slowpoke clones.\"\\n\\n She hated to burst his balloon, but he had to learn sometime. \"That\u0027s for your homework.\"\\n\\n Jason turned to her, his jaw hanging open. \"It\u0027s the beginning of summer, Mom!\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s only a couple hours each day. While I\u0027m gone, I want you to put this time to use. There\u0027s a library on the base. I want you to check out two books while I\u0027m gone and write a book report on each.\"\\n\\n His looked aghast, his eyes wide. \"Some summer!\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027ll be fun. Roland will be\"-she dare not say \u0027baby-sitting,\u0027 or Jason would never forgive her-\"watching you. He\u0027ll be staying here while I\u0027m gone. I expect you to mind him.\"\\n\\n He scrunched up his face, irate.\\n\\n \"If you mind your manners and do your homework… without sulking… there are some surprises in store for you.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah,\" he said, his voice thick with skepticism. \"Like what?\"\\n\\n \"First, I found a martial arts expert on the base who can continue your lessons here. If you want to get your yellow belt by year\u0027s end, you\u0027re gonna need to practice while I\u0027m gone.\"\\n\\n The black cloud over his face lifted just a bit.\\n\\n \"Plus, they have electric bikes and Jet Skis to ride.\"\\n\\n Jason grimaced. \"Why electric?\"\\n\\n \"To help protect the ecosystem they limit the number of combustion engines down here. It\u0027s the military\u0027s small contribution to cavern preservation.\" Ashley remembered Ben\u0027s scowl as they traveled across the base, grumbling the entire way about the blatant abuse of the fragile ecology. Still, Jason\u0027s pout drew back her attention. She brushed some loose strands of hair away from her face. \"But, Jason, that\u0027s not all they have planned. There\u0027s also fishing, basketball, you name it. Plenty to keep you entertained while I\u0027m gone. And if you do well with your studies, Dr. Blakely has promised you can join him in the control room and help monitor our progress. You\u0027ll even be able to talk to me.\"\\n\\n \"Well, I guess that\u0027s okay,\" Jason said, still pouting a bit.\\n\\n \"Finally,\" she said, pointing back into the main room of the suite, \"they have cable. A hundred and fifty channels, all decoded.\"\\n\\n \"Wow, I gotta check that out.\"\\n\\n She caught him by the sleeve as he barreled past her. \"Whoa, there, sonny. First, we have dinner in a half hour. Go get yourself cleaned up.\"\\n\\n \"Geez, Mom. Can\u0027t a guy have a little fun?\" He stomped toward the bathroom.\\n\\n She grinned. Just like home. Only two miles below the bottom of the earth\u0027s surface.\\n\\n \"So what do you think, kid?\" Ben asked as he approached Linda\u0027s back.\\n\\n She stood at the edge of the lake, nicknamed the \"Bottomless Pit\" by the grunts. Only a foot away, black water lapped at a rock from the waves created by a passing Navy pontoon boat.\\n\\n He scratched at the stubble on his cheek.\\n\\n She glanced over at him, the light of the camp dancing in her eyes. \"It\u0027s wondrous.\" She pointed at the ceiling several hundred feet up. \"It\u0027s like being outside.\"\\n\\n He nodded, then shrugged in the direction of the water. \"Thinkin\u0027 of skinny-dipping?\"\\n\\n She smiled. \"No, but you could.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, no, you\u0027d snatch up my skivvies and have the whole base laughing at me.\"\\n\\n She grinned wider, more relaxed. \"That\u0027s not what I meant. I meant you could actually swim in there. I\u0027ve heard that some of the Marines do it. The water is quite warm. Eighty-two degrees. I tested it. Heated by volcanic vents.\"\\n\\n \"Seems strange,\" Ben said. \"Up above, it\u0027s ice and freezing winds. Here, it\u0027s bathwater and tropical breezes.\"\\n\\n \"Not really so strange. I\u0027ve heard that the seas around Deception Island off the coast of Antarctica sometimes heat to spa temperatures. The volcanic activity is so pronounced that often the water actually boils. Just meters away from a glacier.\"\\n\\n \"Uh-huh,\" he said, arching his eyebrows as if he doubted her.\\n\\n She nudged him with her elbow. \"It\u0027s true.\"\\n\\n He smiled. \"Actually, I believe you. I\u0027ve been in other caverns warmed by subterranean rifts. Not really that rare. I was just testing you.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, right,\" she said, rolling her eyes.\\n\\n A glowing amber fish jumped a yard from shore, causing Linda to let out a quick gasp. Ben\u0027s eyebrows narrowed. \"Listen, lass, there\u0027s something I want to talk to you about.\"\\n\\n She wiped damp strands of hair from her face. \"What?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve been watching you, and I… well, I-\"\\n\\n She held up a hand. \"I\u0027m sorry, Ben. I know we went dancing in Buenos Aires, but that was only to let off a little steam. I want to keep this experience purely professional.\"\\n\\n Ben grinned, realizing Linda thought he was making a pass at her. From her looks, she must get that a lot. \"Whoa, there, lady. That\u0027s not why I\u0027m here.\"\\n\\n \"Why, then?\"\\n\\n \"Over the years, I\u0027ve led bushels of tourists into caves, and… well, I can smell trouble. Since our night out dancing, I\u0027ve been watching you. Both in that crowded bar and now here among the caves, you\u0027ve been awfully edgy. Shallow breathing, sweaty palms, pale face.\" Ben saw her eyes sink to the stone floor with his words. \"That\u0027s why I came out to talk to you alone. I thought maybe there was something you\u0027d like to get off your chest.\"\\n\\n She raised her face to him, her eyes rimmed with tears. \"You\u0027re right, Ben. I have a problem with tight places.\"\\n\\n \"Claustrophobia?\"\\n\\n She rubbed at her forehead, eyes down again, and nodded.\\n\\n \"During the trip ahead, there are going to be many tight places. A panicked team member could jeopardize all of us.\"\\n\\n \"I know. But I\u0027m on medication and have been through years of therapy. I can handle this.\"\\n\\n \"Even that tango bar in Buenos Aires shook you up.\"\\n\\n \"Because I didn\u0027t take my pills. Didn\u0027t think I would need them. The bar with its packed crowd and loud music just caught me off guard. I can handle this mission.\"\\n\\n He reached over and held her shoulders. \"You\u0027re sure?\"\\n\\n She looked at him. \"I\u0027ll be fine. I can do this.\"\\n\\n A fish jumped again. This time the splash failed to startle Linda. She continued to stare Ben straight in the eye. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/subterranean/page-9.html","bookId":1526,"book":{"id":1526,"title":"Subterranean","description":"Storyline: Travel to the bottom of the earth to a place you never dreamed existed.
