Someone was coming. But who?\\n\\n She squinted down the feebly lit tunnel until Mo\u0027amba pulled her back into the shadows. She waited, holding her breath. From the sound of the approaching footsteps, more than one person approached.\\n\\n Pressing farther back into the dark alcove, the party slipped past her hiding place and entered umbo\u0027s chamber. She swallowed back a hiss as she recognized the bony physique of one of them. It was Sin\u0027jari.\\n\\n The other two were the exact opposite of Sin\u0027jari. Where he was tall and bony, they were hunched and thick with muscle. But there was no question who was the boss here. A mere frown from Sin\u0027jari would cause the offending party to cringe. And there was a lot of cringing. From the gesturing and sharp commands, it was apparent Sin\u0027jari was giving orders that were only reluctantly being obeyed.\\n\\n Finally, with a bark from their boss, the two bull-necked brutes ducked their heads and crept into the wormhole that led to Alpha Cavern.\\n\\n What was going on? Ashley could not understand a word that was being spoken, but Mo\u0027amba apparently did. She could feel him tensing beside her, actually quivering with suppressed emotion. His tension was contagious. She found herself clenching her fists. Sin\u0027jari was up to something nefarious, something meant to harm her group.\\n\\n Suddenly, Mo\u0027amba burst from the alcove, startling her. She darted after him as he hobbled into umbo\u0027s chamber. Sin\u0027jari swung around with his mouth open, stunned and wide-eyed.\\n\\n Mo\u0027amba crossed to stand almost toe-to-toe with Sin\u0027jari. He stamped his staff so hard splinters flew from its tip. Sin\u0027jari took a step back, obviously flabbergasted by the sudden appearance of his nemesis.\\n\\n Ashley stood to the side as heated words flowed from Mo\u0027amba. Now it was Sin\u0027jari\u0027s turn to cringe. He seemed to fold himself inward as Mo\u0027amba\u0027s words assailed him. But where Sin\u0027jari\u0027s lackeys had fear in their eyes, Sin\u0027jari\u0027s pupils were slitted with menace. From Ashley\u0027s vantage, she could see his hand edging toward the knife at his belt.\\n\\n She opened her mouth to warn Mo\u0027amba, but words caught in her throat. How could she warn him? She couldn\u0027t speak a word of their language. She watched as Sin\u0027jari\u0027s fingers closed on the knife. Mo\u0027amba was a prominent leader. Surely, Sin\u0027jari wouldn\u0027t dare…\\n\\n Without warning, Sin\u0027jari lashed out, driving the long diamond dagger into Mo\u0027amba\u0027s chest. The knife cut Mo\u0027amba\u0027s angry tirade. The old mimi\u0027swee looked down at the hilt protruding from his chest as if analyzing an intriguing bug. He coughed once, a dribble of blood appearing on his lips.\\n\\n Ashley, frozen with shock, finally screamed as Sin\u0027jari yanked the dagger free, then plunged it a second time into Mo\u0027amba\u0027s chest. The old man stumbled backward, pulling himself off the blade.\\n\\n Sin\u0027jari raised the dagger again, meaning to strike at Mo\u0027amba\u0027s throat, but by now Ashley was upon him. She snapped a boot heel into the attacker\u0027s ribs, knocking him aside. As he stumbled to catch his balance, she positioned herself in front of Mo\u0027amba. The old man had by now slumped to the floor. Blood flowed from between his fingers as he clutched his chest.\\n\\n Sin\u0027jari turned to her.\\n\\n \"Get the fuck away, you bastard!\" she screamed.\\n\\n He rubbed his bruised rib with one hand while toying with the blade with the other. His smile was all teeth and no warmth. He had the blade, she didn\u0027t.\\n\\n She eyed the fallen staff that Mo\u0027amba had dropped.\\n\\n Sin\u0027jari didn\u0027t give her a chance to formulate a plan. He lunged at her. But years of karate training and four older brothers had honed her reflexes. She twisted to the side, grabbing Sin\u0027jari\u0027s wrist as his lunge missed her. Pivoting on her foot, she used her hip and Sin\u0027jari\u0027s momentum to flip the bastard to the floor. The snap of cracking bone brought a smile to her lips. His knife skittered uselessly across the rock.\\n\\n In two steps, she had the dagger in hand. Now let\u0027s see what the bastard thinks with the tables turned, she thought. Sin\u0027jari had already scrabbled away, cradling his left arm. He backed from her to the other side of the chamber, obviously giving up the fight.\\n\\n While keeping a wary eye on Sin\u0027jari, she crossed to Mo\u0027amba, who now lay sprawled on his back, his chest heaving in gurgling breaths. He seemed to be staring blindly at the ceiling. In shock.\\n\\n He needed immediate help. But how?\\n\\n She jumped as Sin\u0027jari suddenly stood up. She pointed the knife at him, but he didn\u0027t approach. He slinked, instead, toward the wormhole. With a final sneer at her, he darted into the wormhole and disappeared.\\n\\n Just as he vanished, she heard the sound of many feet approaching down the tunnel. Thank god help was coming.\\n\\n She turned just as the first of the warriors burst into the chamber, spears pointing forward. A keening wail arose from them as they spotted the bloody figure of Mo\u0027amba sprawled across the floor. Almost in unison, the angry and accusing eyes of the hunters turned on her.\\n\\n She looked down at the bloody dagger still in her hand. Damn.\\n\\n \"Calm down,\" Ben said as he grabbed Nob\u0027cobi\u0027s waving hands. He had been trying to make sense of Nob\u0027cobi\u0027s frantic gestures and guttural words but was making no headway. His efforts had only succeeded in frustrating both of them.\\n\\n Ben glanced toward Sandy. She had backed away into a far corner of Blakely\u0027s office, cringing. No help there.\\n\\n He released Nob\u0027cobi\u0027s hands. If only Harry would come… he knew their language.\\n\\n Suddenly Nob\u0027cobi reached over and touched Ben\u0027s forehead with a single finger, then touched his own. Ben stared at him blankly. The tiny hunter repeated the gesture, irritation starting to crinkle his eyes.\\n\\n In another moment, Ben understood. Nob\u0027cobi wanted him to communicate with his heri\u0027huti skills. The hunter couldn\u0027t initiate the contact himself since he wasn\u0027t of the proper blood, but Ben could. Like back in the wormhole.\\n\\n Ben nodded his understanding and gestured for Nob\u0027cobi to sit on the couch. Nob\u0027cobi eyed the leather sofa suspiciously and instead just sat cross-legged on the floor. Ben shrugged and did the same, facing the mimi\u0027swee hunter.\\n\\n Closing his eyes, Ben willed his breathing to slow, striving to calm his agitated mind. He pictured relaxing on the back porch of his father\u0027s sheep station with a warm beer and a lazy day ahead.\\n\\n Suddenly Sandy burst out, \"What are you doing?\"\\n\\n Frowning, Ben held up a hand but kept his eyes closed. \"It\u0027s okay, Sandy. I need you to be quiet for a minute.\"\\n\\n \"But-\"\\n\\n \"Shhh. Just relax.\" His words, dreamy, were directed at both her and himself. Relax.\\n\\n He could hear her grumble under her breath, but he ignored her and sipped his tepid Foster\u0027s from a dusty bottle while tipping back his chair in the corner of the porch. He thought of Nob\u0027cobi, picturing the little fellow\u0027s flat-nosed face and spindly neck. Suddenly, the hunter appeared next to Ben, seated on another chair.\\n\\n Nob\u0027cobi stared slack-jawed around him. He stood up and leaned on the porch railing, gawking up at the wide sky, not a cloud from horizon to horizon. He seemed to cower a bit, then turned his back on the view to face Ben. \"It\u0027s… it\u0027s so big.\" He shuddered.\\n\\n Ben felt a little sorry thrusting the poor man into such a foreign landscape, but Mo\u0027amba had done the same with him. Besides, he missed the ranch. \"Don\u0027t worry, Nob\u0027cobi. It\u0027s not the size that counts.\"\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n \"Never mind. Bad joke.\" Ben took another swig of his beer. Hell if it didn\u0027t taste bloody real. \"Now, what were you trying to tell me?\"\\n\\n Nob\u0027cobi took a nervous swallow, one eye darting behind him. \"I heard a strange noise in the cave. Like nothing I had heard before.\"\\n\\n \"What did it sound like?\"\\n\\n Nob\u0027cobi scrunched up his face and repeated the sound he heard. It sounded like a tune or something. And it sounded familiar.\\n\\n \"Do that again.\" Ben concentrated as he listened, eyes closed. Where had he heard that? His eyes sprang open, and he sat up straight. Christ, it\u0027s that damned jingle from Jason\u0027s Nintendo game! He\u0027d heard the infuriating thing a thousand times during the trek here.\\n\\n \"Where did you hear that?\" Ben blurted.\\n\\n \"I went to look. To see what was making that sound. But I almost ran into that crak\u0027an that\u0027s been hounding us. The smart one. He was following the sound too.\"\\n\\n \"Blast!\" Ben pushed out of the dream, scattering it into colored shreds, until he was facing Nob\u0027cobi again in Blakely\u0027s office. He shoved to his feet. Nob\u0027cobi followed.\\n\\n \"Sandy, stay here,\" Ben said, as he slammed another clip in his gun. \"Lock the door. If we come knocking, open the door in a hurry.\"\\n\\n She nodded and followed him down the hall. \"What\u0027s going on?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t have time to explain.\" He pushed through the door to the reception area. \"Lock it and be quiet.\"\\n\\n He heard the door slam behind him and a deadbolt click. He turned to Nob\u0027cobi. \"Now show me where that sound was coming from.\"\\n\\n The hunter stared at him blankly. Hell, this was not the time for another communication gap. Ben imitated the tune and pretended to look around, then shrugged.\\n\\n Nob\u0027cobi nodded and pointed out the door, taking the lead.\\n\\n Ben clenched his pistol in a white-knuckled grip and followed. If he was too late? He shook his head. He wouldn\u0027t be.\\n\\n He followed Nob\u0027cobi back outside. Just as they turned the corner, Harry suddenly appeared before them. Startled, Ben came within a hair of plugging the man with a bullet.\\n\\n \"You made it,\" Harry said, winded and sweating through his tattered fatigues. \"Let\u0027s get the statue and get out of here. The other hunters are still leading that pod of crak\u0027an on a wild goose chase, but they can\u0027t keep it up much longer. We need to-\"\\n\\n Ben held up a hand. \"I got it already.\"\\n\\n \"Great!\"\\n\\n \"But we\u0027ve got a new problem. We need to hurry.\" Ben motioned Nob\u0027cobi ahead as he gave Harry a thumbnail account of the situation. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/subterranean/page-63.html","bookId":1526,"book":{"id":1526,"title":"Subterranean","description":"Storyline: Travel to the bottom of the earth to a place you never dreamed existed.
