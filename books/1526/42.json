She\u0027s carrying a child in a pouch.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, so what? Did you see those guards at the entryway with the spears and leashed wolf creatures? If we want out of here, it ain\u0027t gonna be easy.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t care. I\u0027m not leaving here until they push me out kicking and screaming. There\u0027s too much to study. Do you realize what this means?\" she said, nodding toward the female.\\n\\n \"What?\"\\n\\n \"Only marsupials carry their young in pouches. These creatures must be evolved from marsupial origins!\"\\n\\n \"Great, we\u0027ve been captured by a bunch of kangaroos.\"\\n\\n She ignored his remark, still thinking out loud. \"The huge predators that attacked us were also a type of early marsupial. It\u0027s like this whole ecosystem\u0027s environmental niches have been filled with various marsupial species. But how? How did they get here? How did they survive?\\n\\n Ben shrugged.\\n\\n \"I mean, think about it, Ben. A whole marsupial ecosystem, separate from mammalian competition and intrusion, has evolved here. In these caverns, evolution has taken an entirely different branch to sentience.\"\\n\\n Just then a hush descended on the whispering crowd. Total silence. Ben nudged her and nodded forward.\\n\\n A towering creature strode out of the entrance to the largest dwelling. He was black-haired, but a spattering of gray dotted his beard, his eyes so richly yellow they almost glowed. The creature stood a head taller than their guide, shoulders wide and muscular. He carried a walking stick taller than himself in his right hand, topped by a ruby the size of a grapefruit.\\n\\n Their guide raised his head for the first time and began speaking rapidly. The other, clearly the leader of the community, blurted a word here and there. Ashley watched the exchange, curious what was being said. Their guide spurted out a last growl and lowered his forehead to the stone before him.\\n\\n The leader finally turned to them, eyeing Ashley first, then Ben. He seemed to be studying them, absently scratching at his belly. He barked something at them. Though unintelligible to Ashley, his words caused the crowd to gasp and step away from them. Some even darted away, scurrying behind drapes.\\n\\n Ashley turned to Ben.\\n\\n He shrugged, then whispered, \"I don\u0027t think this is good.\"\\n\\n The leader stamped his stick on the stone and turned away.\\n\\n Just then a tottering figure with coarse silver hair emerged from a neighboring cave. He moved so slowly and carefully that Ashley was sure she could hear his bones creak. Like the leader, he carried a walking stick, but unlike the leader, he needed it, leaning heavily on the staff with each step. Also, rather than a ruby, his stick was topped by a pear-shaped diamond.\\n\\n Ashley noticed as he approached that painted on his chest was a design in reds and yellows.\\n\\n Ben started fidgeting beside her. \"I gotta be going crazy.\"\\n\\n \"Shhh!\" she said. \"I don\u0027t think it\u0027s polite to talk.\"\\n\\n The ancient one looked toward her. Though his body was obviously old and decrepit, there was a sharp intelligence in his eyes, revealing an agile mind. He turned to Ben and nodded toward him, then began talking to the leader.\\n\\n Ben shifted back a step. \"Ash, I\u0027ve seen that design before. That painting on the ol\u0027 bloke\u0027s chest.\"\\n\\n \"What? Where?\" she whispered.\\n\\n He swallowed hard. A trace of fear frosted his voice. \"In… a dream. Painted on… my dead grandfather.\"\\n\\n She took his hand. \"Listen, we\u0027ll figure that out later. Right now we need to find out what they intend to do with us.\"\\n\\n While they had been whispering, the discussion between the old man and the leader had become heated. Voices were now raised, punctuated by the stamping of walking sticks. Finally, the leader bared his teeth and cracked his walking stick across his knee, snapping it in half, and stormed away.\\n\\n \"Now what?\" Ben asked.\\n\\n The ancient one turned to face them and pointed his stick in their direction. He uttered one word: \"Death.\"\\n\\n TWENTY-TWO\\n\\n EXHAUSTION LULLED MICHAELSON FROM HIS SURVEILLANCE of the tunnel outside his tiny refuge. It had been hours since Ashley and Ben had disappeared, leaving him alone. He strained to listen for any sign of the stalkers. Nothing. Silence pressed like a physical weight against his eardrums.\\n\\n He sighed. At least his ankle\u0027s throbbing had dulled to a mild protest. Eventually he\u0027d have to adjust the ankle splint, but he was too tired for that now. He closed his eyes so he could concentrate with less distraction. Still, there was only silence and more silence.\\n\\n A yawn escaped him, and his head sagged to his chest. He shook his head, knowing he must stay alert.\\n\\n He checked the corridor. Still clear. After several minutes, like sinking suns, his eyelids began to droop downward again. His breathing deepened. He hung suspended in that fuzzy haze between dream and reality.\\n\\n It was then something brushed across his hand.\\n\\n His eyelids snapped open, and he threw his head back, almost cracking the back of his skull on the wall. He fumbled with his gun and pointed it at a man dressed in a ragged Marine uniform, the sleeves torn off at the shoulders. It was impossible. He blinked a few times. Must be dreaming, he thought. But the figure persisted, smiling down at him.\\n\\n Michaelson stared up into the eyes of his long-lost brother. \"Harry? My god! You\u0027re alive!\"\\n\\n His brother pushed the muzzle of Michaelson\u0027s gun away with a fingertip. \"Not if you pull that trigger,\" Harry said, a tired grin on his face.\\n\\n Michaelson threw his gun to the side and, ignoring the protest from his ankle, jumped and grabbed his brother in a bear hug. He squeezed back tears, praying he wasn\u0027t hallucinating, but his brother\u0027s amused chuckles were not those of his imagination. He was real. \"Thank god thank god thank god,\" Michaelson chanted into Harry\u0027s shoulder.\\n\\n \"Brother, you gave us quite a chase,\" Harry said, breaking their hug and swiping a hand through his black hair, a familiar mannerism.\\n\\n Smiling, Michaelson realized he hadn\u0027t seen that gesture in ages. It had been decades since Harry\u0027s hair had been any longer than a tight military crewcut, but after the months down here, the gesture, like an old friend, had returned.\\n\\n Michaelson\u0027s voice caught in his throat. He almost took his brother again in his arms, but then noticed the scar that ran the entire length of Harry\u0027s right arm. It was still pink and raised, something recent. He reached out and touched it. \"What happened?\"\\n\\n Harry\u0027s expression sobered. Michaelson studied his brother\u0027s face closely and noticed the circles under his brother\u0027s blue eyes. A haunted look. Harry had lost weight; the remains of his uniform hung on his frame. \"It\u0027s a long story,\" Harry said.\\n\\n \"Well, I think we have the time.\"\\n\\n \"No, not really. We need to hurry. The crak\u0027an are close.\"\\n\\n \"The who?\"\\n\\n \"Those monsters.\" Harry waved him to follow. \"Gather your gear, soldier, we\u0027re bugging out.\"\\n\\n Michaelson tossed him his gun and climbed into the alcove to collect his pack and canteen. As he crawled back out, he noticed his brother checking his gun with an appreciative smile.\\n\\n Harry handed back the gun reluctantly. \"Nice tool. I could have used that firepower when I was escorting those scientists. Maybe then…\" He stopped talking, a fierce set to his lips.\\n\\n Michaelson approached his brother\u0027s back, laying a hand on his shoulder, still half expecting him to vanish in a puff of smoke, like some trickster spirit, teasing him with his brother\u0027s image. He noticed his brother\u0027s hands were empty. How had he survived running around here without a weapon? \"I\u0027ve got another gun in my pack-\" he started to say.\\n\\n \"No need. I\u0027ve got friends.\"\\n\\n Friends? Michaelson searched the empty passageway, shifting his pack to his shoulder. Who was Harry talking about?\\n\\n His brother then growled something that sent a chill up his back, half howl, half moan, inhuman. Low but penetrating.\\n\\n Michaelson stared at his brother\u0027s back as he howled. Had his brother gone mad during his isolation?\\n\\n Harry turned to him, dead serious. \"Don\u0027t shoot at them.\"\\n\\n \"Who the hell are you talking-\" There was movement along the walls farther down the passage. Small figures, camouflaged against the rock, stepped into the passage, knives and spears glistening in the greenish mold light.\\n\\n Michaelson heard a pebble shift behind him. Glancing around, he saw more were approaching from the rear. \"Harry?\"\\n\\n \"They\u0027re friends. Saved my life.\"\\n\\n One of the creatures separated from the others and approached. His eyes fixed on Michaelson as he edged toward Harry. Michaelson held his gun tightly. The creature, naked, stood only four feet high but was wiry with well-defined muscle. Its shaggy, sandy-colored hair was secured with a blood-red headband. Large eyes searched Michaelson from toe to head, while its prominent ears swiveled in all directions like radar dishes.\\n\\n As the small figure approached, Michaelson judged the weaponry he carried. A long knife with a crude crystalline blade was belted around his bare waist, and in his four-fingered hand, he clutched a long spear.\\n\\n As Michaelson watched, the creature crossed to Harry and handed him the spear. Then it backed away.\\n\\n \"Who are… No, what are they?\"\\n\\n \"They call themselves mimi\u0027swee.\"\\n\\n One of them darted from behind, startling Michaelson, and slid past him to approach Harry. He pointed behind them. \"Doda fer\u0027ago,\" he said. \"Doda crak\u0027an!\"\\n\\n Harry glanced over to Michaelson. \"He says we\u0027ve got company. They\u0027ve caught our scent and are closing in on us. Time to hightail it.\"\\n\\n As if on cue, a roar erupted from behind them. A second and third answered it, coming from all around them. They were being boxed in.\\n\\n Michaelson thought of Ashley and Ben, lost out in the maze of tunnels. He stepped next to Harry. \"Listen, I\u0027ve got friends, and-\"\\n\\n \"I know. A small team of my buddies were dispatched after them.\" He pointed a thumb forward. \"Your friends have been herded to safety.\"\\n\\n \"Where?\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/subterranean/page-42.html","bookId":1526,"book":{"id":1526,"title":"Subterranean","description":"Storyline: Travel to the bottom of the earth to a place you never dreamed existed.
