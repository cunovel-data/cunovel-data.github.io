Why?\"\n Khalid pointed to the far wall, a smile of delight on his features. \"Look, over there! The smoke! It must be the way back up!\" He continued to stare at the billowing smoke, like some cloudy finger of god.\n Still holding Jason under one arm, Linda stared at the smoky tunnel opening. Emotions warred within her: relief at finding a way back up and dread for the events that might transpire. What would Khalid do? He couldn\u0027t let Blakely and Jason know his plans without killing them.\n She turned to stare at Khalid. His expression as he stared up the cliff face was one of strange exaltation, his eyes wide, glassy. A shiver passed through her when those eyes met hers. He smiled at her. \"It\u0027s almost finished,\" he said.\n She nodded. It had all happened too fast. She had expected days of searching before the way home was discovered, giving her plenty of time to formulate a plan, extra hours to decide if she should try to stop him or just save her skin and let him do what he wanted.\n A tugging on her arm distracted her. She looked down at Jason. \"Linda, what about my mom? Do you think she\u0027s okay?\"\n She squeezed the boy\u0027s shoulder as he stared up at her. She should lie, tell him everything would be just fine, but Jason was an astute kid. His eyes as he looked at her were dry and serious. He wanted an honest answer. \"Jason, I truly don\u0027t know. But Ben and Major Michaelson are with her. She\u0027s in good hands.\"\n Jason nodded.\n Khalid touched her shoulder, startling her. He gestured for her to follow him a few steps away, to talk in private. Her heart pounded in her throat as she followed.\n He checked over his shoulder to make sure they were alone. \"Listen, I want us to head out tonight.\"\n Her mouth dried. This was happening too fast, like a freight train racing toward a demolished trestle. \"But Blakely shouldn\u0027t be moved so soon.\"\n Khalid didn\u0027t blink. \"I wasn\u0027t planning on taking him. Or the boy.\"\n Her words were a whisper. \"You promised me that you wouldn\u0027t kill anyone else if I stayed silent.\"\n \"I\u0027m not going to kill them. Just leave them.\"\n \"Is that any different?\"\n He shrugged. \"As I told you, if they find out about my plan, I would be forced to kill them. At least by leaving them, they have a chance to fend for themselves.\"\n Staring at Khalid, she pictured Jason starving to death and Blakely being devoured by a beast. How easily he condemned Blakely and Jason to a lingering death. Where was the heart in this monster? She swallowed. \"I hate this.\"\n \"We\u0027ll leave after the other two fall asleep,\" Khalid whispered in her ear, like a lover passing secrets. \"You won\u0027t have to face them.\"\n His words threatened to destroy her sanity. How could he so casually plan their deaths? Just stroll away from them in the night? How could…?\n Then an idea formed in her mind.\n She chewed on the idea, but there wasn\u0027t much time, and the risk was great. She bit her lower lip, unsure. She watched Jason grin at something Blakely said. She saw his eyes shine brightly in the fungal glow. Shining with young life, with so much of life yet to explore.\n She closed her eyes, firming up her plans. She could do this. No, she would do this. \"Okay, we\u0027ll leave tonight,\" she said with resolve.\n While Linda feigned sleep, Blakely and Jason slept, wrapped in spare blankets. Blakely snored, a whistling gurgle heard over even the rushing falls. But Linda\u0027s slitted eyes stayed focused on Khalid\u0027s profile, where he sat, half in his sleeping bag, leaning on a boulder. She waited. She watched his head slip down, then bob back up as sleep almost overtook him. Almost.\n Linda had talked Khalid into resting a bit, pleading exhaustion herself. Just a nap of two hours, she had begged, enough to charge her batteries for the next leg of their journey. He agreed. She then secretly dissolved several of her prescription anti-anxiety tablets in Khalid\u0027s water and made sure he drank his fill. The strong mineral tang of the local water disguised the taste of the tablets. The pills wouldn\u0027t knock him out-they only had a mild sedative effect-but in these numbers, the medication should make him so drowsy he might accidentally fall asleep while standing guard. It was all she needed.\n She saw his chin hit his chest again. This time his head stayed down.\n With her heart pounding in her ears, she listened, tense in her sleeping bag, close enough to Khalid to recognize when his breathing deepened into a regular rhythm. She knew she did not have much time.\n With agonizing slowness, she inched from her sleeping bag. Thankfully, the roar of the neighboring falls muffled her movements.\n She slipped next to him and collected his lantern and helmet from a nearby rock. She had originally planned to snatch Khalid\u0027s pistol, but he had fallen asleep with it tucked in his sleeping bag. To try to get to it now was too risky.\n So she resorted to a backup plan. She removed the batteries to his lantern and helmet. He may still have the gun, she thought, but let\u0027s see if he can travel blind.\n Once finished, she turned her attention to the dozing doctor. Linda placed her hand over the doctor\u0027s lips, pressing hard when he jerked awake. She leaned over him and pressed a finger to her lips, indicating silence. Once he settled from his shock, she removed her hand and waved for him to follow… quietly. She led him off several yards.\n Once far enough away, she pressed her lips to his ear, hoping the roar of the falls kept her words from reaching the sleeping figures. \"We need to sneak away. Now. Can you travel?\"\n He squinted at her. \"Yes, but why? What\u0027s going on?\"\n She gave him an abbreviated version of the events that led her to him. By the time she had finished, her voice was trembling.\n Blakely\u0027s eyebrows had risen higher and higher as she told her story. \"The asshole! I didn\u0027t think… Hell, it\u0027s my fault. I should have checked more thoroughly. Too damn naive. About everything!\"\n The doctor looked decades older than just a week ago. Sunken eyes, slumped shoulders, even his hair looked grayer. She placed a hand on his arm. \"We need to get Jason and steal away now.\"\n He shook his head. \"Why don\u0027t we just jump on him and wrestle the gun away? Or grab a big rock and clobber him.\"\n \"He\u0027s a trained killer. A machine.\" She could not keep the fear out of her voice. \"We\u0027re no match for him. If he\u0027s attacked and only injured, then we\u0027re dead. It\u0027s safest if we just run. Try to get into the darkened tunnels, where without light, he can\u0027t follow.\"\n \"What about the other hazards out there?\" He pointed toward the far wall. \"We won\u0027t survive long without a weapon.\"\n She hugged her arms around her body. \"I know. But I\u0027d rather take my chances on the unknown than with him.\"\n \"Okay. But we travel light. Only canteens and rations.\"\n She nodded. \"Let\u0027s get Jason.\"\n Jason panicked when he was shaken awake. He couldn\u0027t breathe! He struggled violently for several heartbeats until he realized his respiratory distress was due to Linda\u0027s hand clamped over his mouth.\n She hushed him, her lips at his ear. \"Quiet, Jason.\"\n He stopped struggling, but his heart still pounded, his head ached. What now? More monsters? He scooted up into a seated position and saw Blakely collecting the boxes of dry rations, creeping like a thief in the night, careful where he placed his feet.\n Khalid slumped in his sleeping bag. Both Blakely and Linda kept glancing toward the snoring man. Jason turned to Linda with a question on his lips. She held a finger across her own. He didn\u0027t know why he had to be so darned quiet. The crashing waters were noisy enough. Still, he did as he was told and sat silently.\n Within less than a minute, Linda and Blakely had piled three canteens, flashlights, and a bag of rations near him. Blakely showed Linda a wide-muzzled pistol he had found in the supplies from the boat. A flare gun, Jason noted.\n Blakely crouched by him and whispered, \"Listen, boy, we need to sneak away. Leave Khalid behind. We have to move fast. Do you think you can do that?\"\n He nodded, confused, but from Linda\u0027s pale face and nervous eyes, there was something to fear here. He eyed Khalid, hunched like an ogre.\n Linda and Blakely quickly split up the small pile of supplies and waved him to follow. He stood and picked up his gym bag. Blakely eyed the bag and shook his head. \"Leave it,\" he mouthed to him.\n No way! He could carry it. He wasn\u0027t a baby. He shook his head and clutched his bag tighter.\n The doctor opened his mouth, but Linda touched Blakely\u0027s arm and silenced him. She waved for the two of them to follow her. Jason marched behind her, and Blakely followed.\n No one spoke as they traveled, even when their abandoned camp was hidden by stalagmites and boulders. The silence pressed around Jason, more frightening than screaming monsters and firing guns. Every odd noise made him jump, every crunch of their steps seemed to holler across the cavern. Thankfully, a half hour later, when they finally reached the tumble of rocks and boulders that led up to the smoking tunnel, Linda spoke. \"Look.\" She pointed to the opening far above. \"The smoke has thinned already. That\u0027ll make it easier for us to breathe.\"\n \"Yes,\" Blakely said, \"but it may make it harder for us to trace the way back up.\" His expression was grim as he eyed the climb.\n \"Can you manage?\" Linda asked.\n \"Do I have a choice?\"\n Linda squeezed the doctor\u0027s shoulder, then turned to him. \"Jason, what about you? Can you climb up these boulders?\"\n \"Piece of cake,\" he said with a squeak.\n \"Then we\u0027d better hurry. I don\u0027t know how long the drugs will keep Khalid sleeping.\"\n Khalid dreamed he gripped his mother\u0027s robe as the black storm descended on her camp in the desert. He tried to warn her that the gale was coming, but she just continued to talk to the other robed figures, oblivious to the roaring of the approaching sand and winds. He tugged on her robe, trying to get her attention, but she shoved him aside with her hip. He raced to the tent\u0027s flap, peeking out at the seething maelstrom as it wiped away the horizon. He turned to the group of robed figures, his mother among them. He screamed at them, his voice a reed before the wind. This time they heard him and turned. He opened his mouth to repeat his warning when he saw the faces peering over the veils. Not faces! Skulls. Yellow, sand-scrubbed bone peering over black veils. Skeletal hands reached for him from folds in the robes. He backed away into the roaring storm, a scream clutched in his throat. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/subterranean/page-44.html","bookId":1526,"book":{"id":1526,"title":"Subterranean","description":"Storyline: \n Travel to the bottom of the earth to a place you never dreamed existed.
