If it was blocked, then there was only one other way to proceed forward.\\n\\n Linda stepped up and peeked into the narrow slit. \"But would Halloway have gone this way?\" She seemed to eye the crack with fear. \"I mean, why would he even cross the river?\"\\n\\n Villanueva answered, \"If something attacked him. Something he couldn\u0027t handle. He would try to lead it away. Keep it from surprising us like it did him.\"\\n\\n \"Why do you think that?\" Ashley asked.\\n\\n Villanueva met her eyes. \"It\u0027s what I would have done.\"\\n\\n Ashley chewed at her lip. \"So what do you suggest we do?\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s trying to buy us time to escape. I say we use it.\"\\n\\n She closed her eyes, hating the thought of abandoning him.\\n\\n Ben called from where he had edged into the crack, exploring the passage. \"Come see this!\"\\n\\n As Ashley approached Ben, he reached a hand toward her from the narrow slit. His palm was covered in blood. Fresh blood.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s been this way,\" Ashley muttered. \"Just recently.\" She turned back to Villanueva. \"So do you think we should still go back?\"\\n\\n His jaw muscles tightened. \"You\u0027re the leader.\"\\n\\n Ben climbed from the slit. \"So who\u0027s going through first? We should hurry.\"\\n\\n Ashley sighed. Obviously Ben had been deaf to their discussion. \"It\u0027s more complicated than that.\"\\n\\n \"What? We\u0027re right behind him.\"\\n\\n \"Villanueva thinks Halloway might be trying to draw something away from us.\"\\n\\n Ben\u0027s voice rose in anger. \"Or maybe he\u0027s just bloody hurt! Seeking shelter.\" He grabbed her shoulder. \"Ash, I swear he\u0027s just ahead of us. We can\u0027t leave him.\"\\n\\n She rubbed at her tired eyes, then nodded. \"Okay. Let\u0027s go.\"\\n\\n Linda stood in her underwear, shivering by the wall. She had shed her backpack and even her coveralls. Less to snag and catch, Ben had said. Narrows the profile. She shuddered. How could she possibly wedge her body into that slit? The walls would squeeze the breath from her chest.\\n\\n They waited for Ben to report on his reconnaissance of the crack. He had squished into the black rock over three minutes ago. Ashley and Michaelson stood as sentries to either side as he reported his progress.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m through,\" he called, his voice echoing into their cavern. \"The passage is only six feet long, then it abruptly widens into a decent-sized tunnel. It\u0027s a piece of cake. Only one doozy of a tight spot just near the end.\"\\n\\n Ashley faced the group. \"I\u0027m gonna send Villanueva next. He\u0027s the widest of all of us. If he can make it through, then we all can.\"\\n\\n No one argued.\\n\\n Linda held her breath, hoping the SEAL would fail; then she wouldn\u0027t have to face the crush of those walls. Her heart sank when she heard Ben\u0027s cheer.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s through! Scraped his chest a bit, but no harm done.\"\\n\\n Ashley rubbed her hands together. \"All right! Let\u0027s move!\"\\n\\n Khalid went next. Before he left her side, he gave Linda\u0027s hand a squeeze. She hardly felt it. Linda watched as he disappeared, a rope trailing from his waist. Once through, the rope would be used to ferry the packs through the slit.\\n\\n \"All clear!\" Ben called. \"Send the packs next!\"\\n\\n It took ten long minutes to hook and drag the packs of supplies and weapons to the far side.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s the last of them,\" Ashley yelled. She turned to Linda. \"You\u0027re next.\"\\n\\n Linda didn\u0027t move, staring at the black crack. She willed her legs forward, but they refused. It was getting hard to hear the others over her pounding heart, her wheezing breath.\\n\\n \"Linda?\"\\n\\n \"I… I… can\u0027t do it.\"\\n\\n \"Sure you can. Villanueva is twice as big as you.\"\\n\\n She shook her head, swallowing hard, pushing the words through her constricted throat. \"No. I can\u0027t. It\u0027s too tight.\"\\n\\n Ashley came over and put an arm around her. Linda shivered uncontrollably. \"We can\u0027t leave you behind.\" Ashley tightened the arm around Linda\u0027s shoulder. \"I tell you what. I\u0027ll go with you. Be right behind you. You can do this, Linda.\"\\n\\n Ashley stepped forward, forcing her to follow.\\n\\n \"I… I\u0027ll try,\" Linda said dragging her leaden feet. \"But please hold my hand. Don\u0027t let go.\" Her voice cracked at the end.\\n\\n \"I won\u0027t. We\u0027ll do this together.\"\\n\\n Linda attempted a smile, but failed miserably. Led by the hand, she was coaxed forward. Her mouth felt as if someone had poured a bucket of sand down her throat.\\n\\n \"Just keep your helmet light pointing forward,\" Ashley said. \"Lean your back on the left wall. According to Ben, it\u0027s the smoothest. Then just slide.\"\\n\\n Linda maneuvered her left shoulder into the crack, her toes pointing forward and backward. Inching into the crack, she tried to halt the panicked flutter of her heart and just concentrate on going forward. Up ahead, light diffused around the curve of the narrow crack. Just steps away, the others waited for her.\\n\\n The crack swallowed her up. The walls pressed, too tight even to turn her head to see Ashley behind her. All she could do was slide one leg forward and drag her body along behind it. She counted the steps, trying to divert her mind. A trick from therapy.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re doing fine,\" Ashley said behind her, squeezing her hand. \"Just a little farther.\"\\n\\n … Five… six… seven… Her breathing had steadied to a regular rhythm. One breath with each step. She could now see the end of the passageway, a face peering back at her.\\n\\n \"Good girl,\" Ben said. \"You are one amazing piece of work. Three more steps and you\u0027re through.\"\\n\\n A ghost of a smile played about her lips. She was doing it! eight… nine… te… Her left foot moved forward, but when she tried to wiggle her body to follow, her chest jammed snug in the crack. A squeak escaped her throat. In panic, she tried to force herself ahead, only pinning herself tighter. She squirmed backward, trying to free herself, but failed.\\n\\n Please, not this way! she prayed. Don\u0027t let me die this way. By now she was beginning to hyperventilate, pinpoints of light began swirling before her eyes, her knees began to give way.\\n\\n \"Linda,\" Ashley said. \"Don\u0027t stop now. You\u0027re just about through.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m stuck,\" she squeaked, a panicked pitch to her voice.\\n\\n \"Ben,\" Ashley called ahead. \"Linda\u0027s caught.\"\\n\\n \"Bloody hell,\" he said. \"Give me more lights here!\"\\n\\n In a heartbeat, the crack blazed with light.\\n\\n \"I see,\" Ben said. \"Listen to me, Linda. Reach a hand forward. Stretch it to me. There. I\u0027ve got your hand. Now, on the count of three, I want you to blow out all the air from your lungs, shrink your chest, and I\u0027m going to yank you through.\"\\n\\n \"No,\" she whispered, closing her eyes. She could hardly expand her chest now. \"I\u0027ll get stuck again. Then I won\u0027t be able to breathe at all.\"\\n\\n Silence. A standoff. Then Linda felt Ben release her hand and someone else take it. She recognized the grip. It had supported her over many obstacles. Khalid, her caving partner.\\n\\n The Egyptian spoke in a calm, reassuring voice, almost as if trying to hypnotize her. \"Linda, you know I won\u0027t fail you. You know the strength of my arms. Do as Ben says. I will pull you to me. Trust me.\"\\n\\n Linda\u0027s heart pounded. She opened her eyes again; the pinpoints of light had multiplied to small constellations. She knew she was close to passing out. She nodded her head. \"I trust you.\"\\n\\n \"On the count of three,\" Ben said from behind Khalid. \"One… two… three!\"\\n\\n Linda pushed all the air from her chest, her lungs protesting. Her arm was pulled forward, dragging her body ten inches farther until she jammed again. Tears now coursed her cheek. This was how she would die.\\n\\n Sudden pain shot through her shoulder. Her arm was yanked again, almost separating her shoulder joint. She screamed the last ebb of air from her lungs. It was enough. She popped out of the crack, like a cork from a shaken champagne bottle. Free.\\n\\n \"Is she all right?\" Ashley asked as she slipped from the treacherous crack, noticing that Linda was supported in Khalid\u0027s arms.\\n\\n Ben nodded. \"I think so. Mostly shaken up. Her shoulder\u0027s going to ache like a son of a bitch, but she\u0027ll be fine.\"\\n\\n She nodded. \"That leaves only Michaelson. I want everybody ready to continue once he arrives.\"\\n\\n Villanueva, who was crouched several yards down the tunnel, called to them. \"Halloway\u0027s been this way.\" The SEAL shone a light on his upraised finger. It was red with blood. He then turned the light down the passageway. \"It trails that way.\"\\n\\n Ashley didn\u0027t say a word. Halloway was still running. \"I want everyone armed,\" she said in a small voice. \"Now!\"\\n\\n At the sound of scraping behind her, she turned to see Michaelson scrambling from the crack, his T-shirt torn. Ashley waved the group together. \"Let\u0027s gear up. We leave in two minutes. I want a pistol or rifle in everyone\u0027s hand.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe we should just leave,\" Linda said, her cheeks still wet with tears, her voice trembling.\\n\\n Ashley rested a hand on Linda\u0027s shoulder. \"We\u0027ve come too far. We\u0027ve all got to stick together.\"\\n\\n Linda took a deep breath, seeming to gird herself. When she spoke, her voice was steadier. \"You\u0027re right.\"\\n\\n Ashley squeezed Linda\u0027s shoulder, then faced the team. \"Let\u0027s get moving.\"\\n\\n No one else argued. Within moments, the group was hiking down the tunnel. Villanueva and Ben took the point, scouting several yards ahead.\\n\\n \"Stay within sight,\" she called when Ben drifted too far ahead. \"Let\u0027s keep a tight group.\"\\n\\n The tunnel split at a fork. Which way? Ashley looked questioningly at her scouts. Villanueva pointed with his light. \"Blood trail goes this way,\" he said.\\n\\n Ashley waved with her pistol for them to proceed ahead, expecting to find Halloway\u0027s collapsed body behind every turn of the tunnel. As each step drew them farther down the tunnel, their pace became more furious. Ashley\u0027s group now dogged the more cautious point men. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/subterranean/page-21.html","bookId":1526,"book":{"id":1526,"title":"Subterranean","description":"Storyline: Travel to the bottom of the earth to a place you never dreamed existed.
