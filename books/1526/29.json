When I say pull, you yank the end of the rope to free us.\"\n \"I know,\" Jason said, staring back down the dock.\n Blakely turned to the ignition cord and pulled it. The engine sputtered but didn\u0027t catch. He yanked it again. The same. Shit.\n \"Here comes Roland!\"\n Blakely looked up. His aide sprinted toward them, barely visible through the smoke. He yanked on the cord again. It almost caught this time, sputtering longer before dying. Blakely prayed as he watched Roland scramble toward the dock.\n From out of the smoky blanket, a reptilian head shot forward, grabbing Roland by the shoulder. His body was flipped into the air, his momentum carrying him down the length of the dock. He landed beside the boat, the cracking of bones audible as he crashed to the planks. In thick pulses, blood flowed freely from his torn shoulder.\n Blakely strained toward him, meaning to pull him into the boat.\n The creature had stopped at the dock\u0027s edge, suspicious of the water.\n Blood seeping from his lips, Roland struggled to rise but toppled over. He turned to Blakely and shook his head. With his good arm, he pulled the last mooring free. The boat drifted from the dock\u0027s edge.\n \"Go,\" he sputtered. He struggled to remove a ring from his left hand. He tossed it toward the boat.\n Blakely caught it, recognizing the ring from Roland\u0027s partner in Seattle.\n \"Tell Eric… I love him.\" Roland pulled his pistol from his belt as the creature placed a tentative claw on the dock.\n Blakely yanked the cord, and the engine caught with a clanking whine. With a twist of the gasoline feed, the prow of the boat tilted up as the craft accelerated from the dock. He watched as the monster crept down the dock, hissing toward his friend.\n Roland tried to steady his pistol, but he was rapidly weakening. His first shot went wild. The creature was on top of him now. Roland raised the pistol to his forehead.\n Blakely looked away.\n A shot rang out, echoing over the water.\n When Blakely turned back, the smoke had drawn a curtain between him and the dock. Just a dull glow marked its location through the grime.\n A sudden bellow of frustration trumpeted across the water. It had been denied its kill.\n SEVENTEEN\n \"WHAT DO YOU MEAN, LINDA\u0027S GONE?\" ASHLEY SAID, raising her nose from the radio. She wasn\u0027t able to reach anyone either. \"Why can\u0027t people stay put? I told everyone to stay inside the tunnel.\"\n Michaelson packed away the radio and pointed behind him. \"Sorry. I turned my back on them for a second, and she and Khalid were gone. The tunnel exits another hundred yards ahead.\"\n Ben spoke behind her. \"It\u0027s the claustrophobia. It\u0027s too tight in here.\"\n \"Well, it\u0027s a damned sight tighter in the belly of one of those predators.\"\n \"Khalid already reconnoitered the next chamber,\" Michaelson said. \"I haven\u0027t seen it, but he told me it\u0027s safe. Only a second wormhole enters the chamber. Too small for one of those creatures.\"\n \"Yeah,\" Ashley said, \"but what about other predators? Things that can travel through these wormholes.\"\n Michaelson shrugged.\n \"Fine. Let\u0027s head on. I want the team to stick together.\" She helped Michaelson with the sleeping Villanueva; he moaned as he was moved. She checked his forehead. Damp, but not feverish. He needed help soon too. Damn this shitty radio.\n Michaelson backed down the tunnel, pulling the SEAL along. Ashley pushed from behind, her knees raw by the time the glow of the exit appeared. Ben brought up the rear, lugging the packs. With a final heave, the SEAL was extracted from the tunnel. Ashley tumbled after him-into a natural wonderland.\n \"Holy shit!\" Ben said as he crawled from the tunnel. \"I\u0027ve died and gone to heaven.\"\n Ashley stood stunned. Before her opened a chamber the size of a small ballroom. Almost cozy. Iridescent crystals, some as small as thumbnails, others the size of ripe watermelons, encrusted the walls and floor, casting back the lamplight in scintillating sparks. Rainbows reflected everywhere. Stepping gingerly across the uneven floor, Ashley crossed to the center of the chamber, her mouth hanging open.\n \"Do you know what this is?\" Ben asked, slipping his hand in hers.\n She just shook her head. Linda and Khalid crouched a few yards away, noses together, examining one of the larger crystals.\n \"We\u0027re in a gigantic geode,\" Ben said.\n \"What\u0027s that?\" she asked, only half interested, unable to turn away from the natural splendor.\n \"You\u0027ve seen them. Those hollow stones sold in naturalist shops that are cracked open and lined by clear quartz or purple amethyst crystals. They form predominantly in volcanoes and are usually spurted out during an eruption.\"\n \"Yeah, I\u0027ve seen those, but they\u0027re seldom bigger than beachballs.\"\n \"I know.\" He waved a hand to encompass the room. \"Nothing like this has ever been discovered. But hell, we\u0027re miles under an active volcano.\"\n She looked at his face, ruddy in the reflected light, strong chin raised as he stared at the ceiling. His excitement was contagious. She squeezed his arm.\n Michaelson intruded, stepping up to them. \"If this is quartz, maybe the sheer load is somehow affecting the radio. But I doubt it.\"\n She hadn\u0027t thought of that. Hope flooded her. Perhaps…\n Khalid called to them. \"It\u0027s not quartz.\"\n \"What?\" she asked, surprised to hear him join the conversation. He was usually so tight-lipped. \"Then what is it?\"\n \"It\u0027s diamond.\"\n Ben laughed. \"Sure it is.\"\n \"Who\u0027s the geologist here? Look at the angle of crystal fracturing. It\u0027s diamond.\"\n Thunderstruck, everyone looked again at the pure mass of stone around them. Khalid smirked at their surprise.\n Linda held up a chunk of diamond the size of a softball. \"My god!\"\n Ashley thought of the diamond statue. How many other, similar chambers were down here? This much wealth…\n The sharp edge of her excitement dulled with concern. She shook her head and released Ben\u0027s hand. \"Before everyone starts counting their pennies, we still need to get out of here. Michaelson, try the radio one more time. Everyone else, set up camp for the night.\"\n As she made her announcement, her exhaustion finally hit her. Every muscle burned. Every square inch of skin felt bruised. It seemed like they had been running for days. She glanced at her watch. After midnight.\n \"Still no response,\" Michaelson said, turning off the radio.\n Ben spoke from where he had set up an air mattress. He had his geopositional compass open. \"This isn\u0027t working either. Maybe Michaelson\u0027s right about some sort of interference. My compass uses a radio beacon at the base as a stationary reference point to home in on.\" He snapped the compass closed. \"This bloody thing keeps searching, but it\u0027s not picking up the beacon.\"\n She nodded, too exhausted to think clearly and too worried about Jason. \"Perhaps it\u0027s some power outage at the base. We\u0027ll try again in the morning,\" she said, rubbing at her eyes. Her mind kept pushing Jason\u0027s face before her. If she thought about him too much, she\u0027d begin to cry. What could they do anyway? Tomorrow would have to be soon enough.\n Ben stepped up to her; he had finished inflating her air mattress. \"Your bed awaits.\" He made a sweeping bow.\n She took the mattress with a weary smile. \"Thanks, Ben.\"\n \"I found a relatively flat area over there. Just enough room for two people.\" A grin played about the corner of his lips, the invitation clear.\n In answer, she crossed to the spot and placed her mattress down. His smile had widened with each step she took. \"Who\u0027s going to take first watch?\" she asked.\n \"Watch?\" Ben said.\n She nodded. \"We\u0027re in uncharted worlds down here. Carnivorous snails, whale-sized sharks, and now marsupial predators. We don\u0027t know what else might be lurking out there. Just in case, someone needs to stand guard… We\u0027ll rotate shifts.\"\n Michaelson spoke up. \"I\u0027ll take the first shift, but with two entrances to the cavern, I recommend two people per shift.\"\n \"Good idea. Any volunteers to join Michaelson on first watch?\" She stared directly into Ben\u0027s eyes.\n He resisted for a few heartbeats, then sighed and raised his hand. \"Gosh, I feel a second wind coming on.\"\n With the schedule established, those not on watch retired to their respective beds. Ashley sank into her mattress as if in a lover\u0027s embrace. Soon all but a single handlight clicked off. Expecting to be swallowed by darkness, her lids drooped downward. What the…? She sat back up. The chamber had not darkened; it continued to glow.\n Ben stood up. \"Bloody hell, this\u0027ll save on batteries.\"\n Linda sat up. \"It\u0027s coming from the walls,\" the biologist said, glancing around. \"Reflecting off the diamonds.\" She crawled up and crossed to a wall where a section of diamond had fallen away. Scraping with the edge of a blade, she studied the rock, then turned to them with the blade upheld. It glowed a soft yellow. \"It\u0027s fungus.\"\n Great, Ashley thought. With our luck, it\u0027s probably emitting some toxic radiation.\n \"What a find!\" Linda settled onto her mattress and wiped the blade off in a specimen bag. She wore a huge grin, talking rapidly as she worked. \"This makes the fifth phosphorescent species I\u0027ve found down here so far. Even the fish back at Alpha Base glowed due to the buildup of a type of fungus on their scales. But this…\" She waved her arm. \"This is almost worth being chased by monsters.\"\n Michaelson sat back down and rested his rifle across his knees. \"Is it worth someone dying for?\"\n Linda\u0027s smile deflated, and she sealed the bag.\n The major\u0027s words sobered the team, and exhaustion overcame wonder. Everyone settled back to bed.\n Ashley stretched and curled her wool blanket around her bare feet, retreating into a cocoon. She peeked at Ben\u0027s empty mattress. She could hear the two men mumbling quietly together as they stood watch. She closed her eyes, touching the tip of her tongue to her bruised lower lip, remembering his kiss, and fell into a dreamless sleep. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/subterranean/page-29.html","bookId":1526,"book":{"id":1526,"title":"Subterranean","description":"Storyline: \n Travel to the bottom of the earth to a place you never dreamed existed.
