It\u0027s your shift.\" Ben\u0027s lips brushed her ear. \"I even made some coffee.\"\\n\\n She moaned and pushed herself upright, rubbing at her gritty eyes. Her muscles felt like stone weights. \"Thanks, Ben… coffee sounds wonderful.\"\\n\\n He helped her stand. \"It tastes like mud, but it\u0027ll crank those pretty eyelids up.\"\\n\\n She offered him a weak grin. She noticed Michaelson was already bundling up in his blanket. \"You\u0027d better get what sleep you can. It\u0027s only a few hours until morning.\"\\n\\n He nodded, sliding out of his boots as he sat on his mattress. \"I\u0027ll be out as soon as my noggin hits the pillow.\"\\n\\n She envied him. Her rumpled blanket never looked so inviting. Yawning, she crossed to the makeshift guard station by the camp stove. She was surprised to see Linda sitting next to Khalid. \"What are you doing up?\" she asked as she approached. \"This is supposed to be Khalid\u0027s and my shift.\"\\n\\n \"I know,\" Linda said, sliding over to make room on the boulder. \"But I couldn\u0027t sleep. Too excited. I wanted to run a few tests. Besides, I took a little nap and that\u0027s all I usually need.\"\\n\\n Ashley noticed the biologist\u0027s test kit spread out on a relatively smooth table of rock. Linda raised a small vial in front of the lantern light and shook it. The phosphorescent glow in the vial increased. \"Amazing,\" she said, then jotted a note in her logbook.\\n\\n Ashley glanced at Khalid. Holding a pistol in his left hand, he cautiously lifted the hot coffeepot from the camp stove. He sloshed some of the syrupy drink into a tin cup.\\n\\n Absently, Linda held up her cup for a refill, not even glancing in his direction. Almost like an old married couple at breakfast.\\n\\n Once her cup was filled, Linda took a sip from her cup and grimaced. \"This is awful.\" But she took another sip, then sighed. She sat back and glanced at Ashley. \"You know, since I\u0027m up anyway, why don\u0027t you go back to bed?\"\\n\\n This option hadn\u0027t occurred to her, but it made sense and was damned attractive. \"I suppose if you really think that you-\\n\\n Linda nodded. \"You need the sleep. You should see your eyes. They\u0027re blood-red.\"\\n\\n And they felt like it too. Ashley glanced over to where Ben was snoring. Linda didn\u0027t have to offer twice. \"I\u0027ll see you in the morning.\"\\n\\n \"Before you go, though,\" Linda said from behind her, \"there\u0027s a question that\u0027s been naggin\u0027 me.\"\\n\\n Ashley turned back reluctantly, the pull of her mattress strong. \"What\u0027s that?\"\\n\\n \"Those marsupial creatures. They\u0027re obviously predatory. How does something like that get enough food to eat?\"\\n\\n She shrugged. \"I don\u0027t know.\"\\n\\n \"I mean, they have to be at the top of the food chain. But who\u0027s below them? Look at the lions in Africa. To support even a small pride of lions, it takes a huge reservoir of herbivores-antelopes, water buffalo, zebras. From a biological standpoint, these beasts would need a huge supply of prey.\"\\n\\n Ashley rubbed her sore eyes. \"Yeah, I guess so.\"\\n\\n \"So, where are they?\" Linda took another sip of coffee. \"Where is their food supply?\"\\n\\n Khalid snorted. \"Hell, all I know is that I don\u0027t want it to be us.\"\\n\\n Ashley nodded. The question was intriguing. What did they hunt? From their demonstrated teamwork in the other chamber, they had a rudimentary intelligence. Almost cunning. \"I\u0027m not sure. It\u0027s a mystery that\u0027ll have to be answered by a future team.\"\\n\\n Linda nodded. She held up a second vial of yellow phosphorescence. \"So many mysteries down here…\" She checked a note in her book and pursed her lips.\\n\\n Ashley said her good nights and retired to her mattress. She snuggled into her blankets, still warm from her recent slumber. Sighing, she closed her eyes, but the biologist\u0027s questions nagged at her. What did they eat?\\n\\n Ben struggled in his sleep, knowing he was dreaming but unable to stop it. He was in that damned cavern once again. He walked among the fruit-laden trees, red pulpy gourds drooping obscenely.\\n\\n \"Hello,\" he hollered into the grove of trees.\\n\\n No answer.\\n\\n He had seen an image of his grandfather the last time he was down here. In a cave. Now, just where was that? He headed in a direction that seemed familiar. He brushed past a low mass of foliage with petite blue flowers. Didn\u0027t he pass a similar bush before? It was like returning to your hometown after being gone for decades. His feet seemed to remember their previous steps.\\n\\n As he approached the far wall, he knew he was going the right way. He could even see the black hole in the glowing wall. Glowing? It was the same fungus growing in the geode room. Strange.\\n\\n He continued toward the wall, expecting the trees to block his way forward, like his previous visit. But this time no trees stopped him. Taking a handful of steps, he found himself standing before the wall, a soft muskiness enveloping him. The fungus was sporing little pods the size of pinheads. He brushed a hand against the wall. With the sweep of his hand, the odor became overpowering. His mind reeled. Explosions of colors flashed before his eyes. He swooned to his knees, fighting to stay conscious, but his vision swirled in fantastic eddies of colors and textures. He slipped to the floor, the back of his head exploding as it hit the ground.\\n\\n A voice arose from beside him. \"Benny-boy, enough of that bloody crap.\"\\n\\n He knew that voice from childhood. It was his grandfather.\\n\\n \"Jesus, snap out of it, mate.\"\\n\\n His vision cleared as his grandfather waved a twisted leaf under his nose. It smelled of mint with a hint of cherry. With each wave, the swirls of colors were wiped away, as if erased by the passing of the leaf. \"There you go, Benny-boy. \u0027Bout time you got your bloody arse down here.\"\\n\\n Of course, he was dreaming-but it seemed so real. He could see the spiderweb of broken blood vessels at the tip of his grandfather\u0027s nose. The tufts of white hair at the edges of his ears. The ever-present laughter in his eyes. \"Granddad?\"\\n\\n \"Who\u0027d ya think?\"\\n\\n \"Well, considering you\u0027re buried six feet under Aussie soil, I didn\u0027t much expect to run into you anytime soon.\" He pushed himself upward, the musky odor still strong, threatening to overwhelm him again. \"Why are you here?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve been sent to warn you.\"\\n\\n \"We know about those black beasties. You\u0027re a little late.\"\\n\\n \"Those wankers? Don\u0027t let them pests get to ya.\"\\n\\n \"Pests? Those \u0027pests\u0027 just about consumed our entire crew.\"\\n\\n His grandfather sat down beside him, crossing his legs.\\n\\n \"Benny-boy, you have to continue down. Don\u0027t go up.\"\\n\\n \"But-\"\\n\\n \"Down, Bennie-boy. Down.\"\\n\\n The muskiness intruded again, smearing the image of his grandfather with wide swatches of purple and orange. \"I don\u0027t understand…\" He felt himself falling away again.\\n\\n Only his granddad\u0027s words followed him as he faded away: \"… down… down…\"\\n\\n \"Wake up, Ben.\" Ashley patted his shoulder, surprised at how deeply he slept. The others were already up and about. He was the last still in his bedroll. Even Villanueva was sitting up, doing much better, his arm in a crude sling.\\n\\n She shook Ben\u0027s shoulder. \"C\u0027mon, breakfast is about ready.\" She glanced over to where Michaelson was bent over the campstove. How he managed to turn dehydrated eggs into a damned close approximation of a Denver omelet was a mystery that would baffle Betty Crocker. Her stomach rumbled in response to the tantalizing scent of grilled onions and tinned ham.\\n\\n Ben groaned, rolling onto his back, eyes cracked open a slit. \"Bloody hell, what is that stench?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s breakfast, and if you don\u0027t hurry, you\u0027ll be eating cold cereal.\"\\n\\n He propped himself up on his elbows, his hair sticking out in all directions. He scratched at himself under the blanket. \"Blimey, my head\u0027s aching like she\u0027s about to blow. It\u0027s not fair that I get a hangover without a fine evening at the pub.\"\\n\\n Concerned, Ashley placed her hand on his forehead. Thankfully, Ben had no fever. \"It\u0027s just a headache. I\u0027ll get you a couple aspirin.\"\\n\\n \"How about a fistful?\" he said with a tired grin.\\n\\n She crossed over to the bag that held the first-aid kit, shaking out three aspirin from a small plastic bottle.\\n\\n Villanueva sat next to the kit. \"He doesn\u0027t look too well.\"\\n\\n Ashley couldn\u0027t help but smile at his observation. This from a man whose shirt was still soaked in his own dried blood and whose arm had just about been torn off. \"I\u0027m sure Ben will be fine. You, on the other hand, need to rest. You shouldn\u0027t even be sitting up.\"\\n\\n He looked at her stonily, as if she were speaking a foreign language.\\n\\n Michaelson stepped up behind her and handed the SEAL a steaming bowl. \"Chicken broth,\" he said when Villanueva raised his eyebrows. \"You lost a lot of blood. You need plenty of replacement fluid. Drink up.\"\\n\\n Ashley crossed over to Ben, a slight smile on her face. Major Michaelson was turning into a regular Florence Nightingale.\\n\\n \"Thanks,\" Ben said, when she offered him the aspirin, \"but I\u0027m already feeling better. Once I\u0027m up and moving, I\u0027ll be more chipper than a \u0027roo with a full pouch.\"\\n\\n \"Take the aspirin anyway.\" She pushed the tablets into his hand and passed him a cup of water. \"We\u0027ve still got a big day ahead of us.\"\\n\\n He pouted but took the pills. \"Now, weren\u0027t you saying something about breakfast earlier? I always wanted to be served breakfast in bed.\"\\n\\n \"If you\u0027re feeling hungry, then you\u0027re fit enough to get your own meal. Besides, we need everyone together at breakfast to discuss our options, and I want your input.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, all right. But that\u0027s a good way to give everyone a bad case of indigestion.\"\\n\\n She helped him stand. \"Quit griping.\"\\n\\n With a mock scowl, he accompanied her to the camp stove, where Michaelson was already scooping out platefuls of omelet and fried potatoes. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/subterranean/page-30.html","bookId":1526,"book":{"id":1526,"title":"Subterranean","description":"Storyline: Travel to the bottom of the earth to a place you never dreamed existed.
