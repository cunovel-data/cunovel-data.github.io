{"id":23253,"no":13,"title":"CHAPTER XII. AFTER THE BATTLE.","content":"Without waiting to hear Mr. Drummond\u0027s reply to his explanation, Walter re-entered the store. He had no disposition to discuss the subject in presence of the boys who were standing on the piazza. Mr. Drummond followed him into the store, and Joshua accompanied him. He was terribly angry with Walter, and determined to get revenged upon him through his father. \"Are you going to let that beggar pitch into me like that?\" he demanded. \"He wouldn\u0027t have got me down, only he took me at disadvantage.\" \"Conrad,\" said Mr. Drummond, \"I demand an explanation of your conduct. I come from my house, and find you fighting like a street rowdy, instead of attending to your duties in the store.\" \"I have already given you an explanation, Mr. Drummond,\" said Walter, firmly. \"Joshua chose to[Pg 109] insult me before all the boys, and I don\u0027t allow myself to be insulted if I can help it. As to being out of the store, there was no customer to wait upon, and I went to the door for a breath of fresh air. I have never been accustomed to such confinement before.\" \"You say Joshua insulted you. How did he insult you?\" \"I was asked if I would go to the picnic on Saturday afternoon. He didn\u0027t wait for me to answer, but said at once that I couldn\u0027t come.\" \"Was that all?\" \"On my objecting to his answering for me, he charged me with being a beggar, and said that but for you I would have been obliged to go to the poor-house. If this had been the first time he had annoyed me, I might have passed it over, but it is far from being the first; so I knocked him down.\" Mr. Drummond was by no means a partisan of Walter, but in the month that our hero had been in his employ he had found him a very efficient clerk. Whatever Walter undertook to do he did well, and he had mastered the details of the retail dry-goods trade in a remarkably short time, so that his services were[Pg 110] already nearly as valuable as those of young Nichols, who received eight dollars a week. Therefore Mr. Drummond was disposed to smooth over matters, for the sake of retaining the services which he obtained so cheap. He resolved, therefore, to temporize. \"You are both of you wrong,\" he said. \"Joshua, you should not have called Conrad a beggar, for he earns his living. You, Conrad, should not have been so violent. You should have told me, and I would have spoken to Joshua.\" \"Excuse me, Mr. Drummond, but I don\u0027t like tale-bearing. I did the only thing I could.\" \"Ahem!\" said Mr. Drummond, \"you were too violent. I would suggest that you should each beg the other\u0027s pardon, shake hands, and have done with it.\" \"Catch me begging pardon of my father\u0027s hired boy!\" exclaimed Joshua scornfully. \"I haven\u0027t got quite so low as that.\" \"As for me,\" said Walter, \"if I thought I had been in the wrong, I would beg Joshua\u0027s pardon without any hesitation. I am not too proud for that, but I think I acted right under the circumstances,[Pg 111] and therefore I cannot do it. As for being a hired boy, I admit that such is my position, and I don\u0027t see anything to be ashamed of in it.\" \"You are right there,\" said Mr. Drummond; for this assertion chimed in with his own views and wishes. \"Well, it seems to me you are about even, and you may as well drop the quarrel here.\" \"I am ready to do so,\" said Walter, promptly. \"If Joshua treats me well, I will treat him well.\" \"You\u0027re mighty accommodating,\" sneered Joshua. \"You seem to think you\u0027re on an equality with me.\" \"I am willing to treat you as an equal,\" answered Walter, purposely misinterpreting Joshua\u0027s remark. \"Oh, you are, are you?\" retorted Joshua, with a vicious snap of the eyes. \"Do you think you, a hired boy, are equal to me, who am a gentleman?\" \"I am glad to hear that you consider yourself a gentleman, and hope you will take care to act like one.\" \"I\u0027ll give you the worst licking you ever had!\" exclaimed Joshua, clenching his fists furiously. \"If it isn\u0027t any worse than you gave me just now, I can stand it,\" said Walter. [Pg 112] He was a little angry, also, and this prompted him to speak thus. Joshua was maddened by this remark, and might have renewed the battle if his father had not imperatively ordered him to leave the store. \"Conrad,\" said Mr. Drummond, \"you have behaved badly. I did not think you were so quarrelsome.\" \"I don\u0027t think I am, sir; but I cannot stand Joshua\u0027s treatment.\" \"Will you promise not to quarrel with him again?\" \"That depends on whether he provokes me.\" \"Of course I can\u0027t have you fighting with my son.\" \"I don\u0027t care about doing it. If I find he won\u0027t let me alone, I have made up my mind what to do.\" \"What?\" \"I will leave the store, and go back to Willoughby; then I will decide what to do. I know that I have got to earn my own living, but I would rather earn it somewhere where I can be at peace.\" \"Humph!\" said Mr. Drummond, who did not[Pg 113] fancy this determination; \"don\u0027t be too hasty. I will speak to Joshua, and see that he doesn\u0027t annoy you again.\" With this assurance Walter felt satisfied. He felt that he had won the victory and maintained his self-respect. There was one thing more he desired, and that was to go to the picnic. He would not have urged the request, but that he was well aware that Joshua would report that he was kept at home by his desire. \"It won\u0027t be very convenient for you to be away Saturday afternoon,\" said Mr. Drummond, who was principled against allowing clerks any privileges. \"You know we have more trade than usual on Saturday afternoon.\" \"I don\u0027t think we shall have next Saturday,\" said Walter; \"everybody will be gone to the picnic.\" \"If you insist upon going,\" said Mr. Drummond, reluctantly, \"I must try to let you go.\" Walter felt no scruples about insisting. He knew that he earned his limited pay twice over, and that his absence would do his employer no harm. He answered, therefore, \"Thank you, sir; I will be[Pg 114] home at six o\u0027clock, so as to be in the store all Saturday evening.\" Meanwhile Joshua went home in a very unhappy frame of mind. He had not succeeded in humiliating Walter as he intended, but had an unpleasant feeling that Walter had got the better of him. He was very angry with his father for not taking his part, and was not slow in making his feelings known to his mother. \"What\u0027s the matter, Joshua?\" asked Mrs. Drummond, observing the scowl upon his face. \"Matter enough! That beggar has been insulting me.\" \"What beggar? I haven\u0027t seen any beggar about,\" answered Mrs. Drummond. \"You know who I mean,—that upstart, Conrad.\" \"What\u0027s he been doing? I\u0027m sure he\u0027s a very gentlemanly young man.\" \"Oh, yes, that\u0027s just the way. You take his part against your own son,\" said Joshua, bitterly. \"What\u0027s he been doing? You haven\u0027t told me.\" \"He pitched into me, and tried to knock me over.\" [Pg 115] \"What for? I am surprised to hear it, he seems so polite and well-bred.\" \"Nothing at all. He sprung at me like a tiger, and all for nothing. He took me by surprise, so at first he got the advantage; but I soon gave him as good as he sent.\" \"I am really sorry to hear this,\" said Mrs. Drummond, distressed. \"Are you sure you didn\u0027t say something to provoke him?\" \"I only said, when he was invited to go to the picnic Saturday afternoon, that he wouldn\u0027t be able to leave the store.\" \"I am afraid you said it in such a way as to offend him.\" \"Seems to me you think a good sight more of him than of me in the matter,\" grumbled Joshua. \"That\u0027s just the way with father. He wanted us both to beg each other\u0027s pardon. Catch me begging pardon of a beggarly hired boy!\" \"He isn\u0027t any worse because your father hires him, Joshua.\" \"Oh, yes, of course you stand up for him,\" said Joshua, sneering. \"Now, Joshua, you know I always take your part when you are right.\" So Joshua continued to scold, and Mrs. Drummond to soothe him, until she found a more effectual way, by placing at his disposal half an apple-pie which was in the cupboard. In the evening she told Walter that she was sorry there had been any difficulty between him and Joshua. \"So am I,\" said Walter, frankly, for he was grateful for her gentle kindness. \"I am sorry, if only for your sake, Mrs. Drummond.\" \"I know he\u0027s provoking; but he don\u0027t mean what he says, Mr. Conrad.\" \"I\u0027ll try to keep on good terms with him, Mrs. Drummond,\" said Walter, earnestly, \"if only in return for his mother\u0027s kindness.\" \"I am sure Joshua was hasty, and misjudged Walter,\" said the mother to herself, trying to find an excuse for her son. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3005/82936.html","bookId":296,"book":{"id":296,"title":"Strong and Steady Or, Paddle Your Own Canoe","description":"简介： It\u0027s ever so much better than my roomtwice as big, to begin with.
