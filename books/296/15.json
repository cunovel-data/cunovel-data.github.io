{"id":23255,"no":15,"title":"CHAPTER XIV. A BRILLIANT SCHEME.","content":"One morning, a few days later, Joshua was walking moodily up the village road with his hands in his pockets. He was reflecting, in a spirit of great discontent, on the hardships of his situation. \"Here am I,\" he said to himself, \"eighteen years old, and father treats me like a boy of ten. I\u0027m most a man, and all he gives me for pocket-money is twenty-five cents a week. There\u0027s Dick Storrs, whose father isn\u0027t a quarter as rich as mine, gets a dollar a week. He\u0027s only sixteen, too.\" One important difference between himself and Dick Storrs did not occur to Joshua. Dick worked in a shoe-shop, and it was out of his own wages that his father allowed him a dollar a week. Joshua earned nothing at all. \"It\u0027s mean!\" reflected Joshua. \"There aint a boy of my age in Stapleton that\u0027s so meanly treated,[Pg 128] and yet my father\u0027s the richest man in town. I wish I knew what to do to get a little money.\" At this moment he saw Sam Crawford approaching him. Sam was perhaps a year younger than Joshua. He had formerly lived in the village, but was now in a situation in New York, and was only in Stapleton for a few days. \"How are you, Joshua?\" said Sam. \"Well enough,\" said Joshua. \"Where are you going?\" \"I\u0027m going round to the ice-cream saloon. Won\u0027t you come with me?\" \"Yes, if you\u0027ll treat. I haven\u0027t got any money.\" \"You ought to have. The old man\u0027s got plenty.\" \"That\u0027s so. But he\u0027s getting meaner every day. What do you think he allows me for spending money?\" \"I don\u0027t know. A dollar a week?\" \"A dollar! I should think myself lucky if I got anywhere near that. What do you say to twenty-five cents?\" \"You don\u0027t mean to say that\u0027s all he gives you?\" [Pg 129] \"Yes, I do.\" \"Why, I can\u0027t get along on ten times that. Why don\u0027t you ask for more?\" \"I have, fifty times; but that\u0027s all the good it does.\" \"If my father treated me like that, I\u0027d cut his acquaintance.\" \"I don\u0027t know as that would do me any good,\" said Joshua, rather sensibly. \"I wish I knew of any way of getting some money.\" \"You might hire out to saw wood for the neighbors,\" said Sam. \"I haven\u0027t got so low as that,\" said Joshua, haughtily. \"Of course I meant that in joke; but you might get a place, and earn some money.\" This suggestion, however, did not suit Joshua, for it carried with it the idea of work, and he was as lazy as he was selfish; which is saying as much as can well be said on that point. \"The old man ought to give me enough to spend, without work,\" he said. \"He don\u0027t spend more than a third of his income.\" [Pg 130] \"He\u0027s saving it up for you.\" \"I\u0027m not likely to get it for a good many years,\" said Joshua, who actually seemed to be angry with his father for living so long. However, though it is doubtful whether Joshua would have been a dutiful or affectionate son under any circumstances, it must be admitted that Mr. Drummond had done very little to inspire filial affection. \"Look here!\" said Sam, suddenly, \"I have an idea. Did you ever buy a lottery ticket?\" \"No,\" answered Joshua. \"There\u0027s a fellow I know in New York that drew a prize of a thousand dollars, and how much do you think he paid for a ticket?\" \"I don\u0027t know.\" \"Five dollars. How\u0027s that for high?\" \"How long ago is that?\" asked Joshua, becoming interested. \"Only two months ago.\" \"Do you know him?\" \"Yes, I know him as well as I know you. He is clerk in a store just opposite ours. When he got[Pg 131] the money he gave half a dozen of us a big dinner at Delmonico\u0027s. We had a jolly time.\" \"A thousand dollars for five!\" repeated Joshua. \"He was awfully lucky. What lottery was it?\" \"It was one of the Delaware lotteries.\" \"Do you know the name of it?\" \"No, but I\u0027ll tell you what I\u0027ll do. The fellow I was speaking of gets lottery papers regularly. I\u0027ll ask him for one, and send it to you as soon as I get back to the city.\" \"I wish you would,\" said Joshua. \"Wouldn\u0027t it be splendid if I could draw a prize of a thousand dollars?\" \"I\u0027ll bet it would. It would make you independent of the old man. You wouldn\u0027t care much for his twenty-five cents a week then?\" \"No, I\u0027d tell him he might keep it till he got rich enough to afford me more.\" \"He\u0027d open his eyes a little at that, I reckon.\" \"I guess he would. When are you going back to the city?\" \"The last of this month. My time will be up then.\" [Pg 132] \"You won\u0027t forget to send me the paper?\" \"No, I\u0027ll remember it. Come in and have an ice-cream. You can return the compliment when you\u0027ve drawn a prize.\" \"All right! Is a thousand dollars the highest prize?\" \"No, there are some of two, three, and five thousand. Then there are five-hundred-dollar prizes, and so along to five dollars. Five hundred wouldn\u0027t be so bad, eh?\" \"No, I should feel satisfied with that. I would come up to New York, and spend a week.\" \"If you do, just step in upon me, and I\u0027ll show you round. I know the ropes.\" \"I wish I could,\" said Joshua, enviously. \"This is an awfully stupid place. I tried to get leave to go to the city last fall, but the old man wouldn\u0027t let me. He wasn\u0027t willing to spend the money.\" I hope none of my readers will so admire the character of Joshua Drummond as to imitate him in the disrespectful manner in which he speaks of his father. Yet I am aware that many boys and young men, who are not without respect and affection for[Pg 133] their parents, have fallen into the very discreditable way of referring to them as \"the old man\" or \"the old woman.\" They may be sure that such a habit will prejudice against them all persons of right feeling. Joshua and Sam went into the ice-cream saloon, which was kept, during the summer only, in a small candy store, by a maiden lady who eked out a scanty income by such limited patronage as the village could afford. Joshua plied his companion with further questions, to all of which he readily replied, though it is doubtful whether all the answers were quite correct. But Sam, having been in the city a few months, wished to be thought to have a very extensive acquaintance with it, and was unwilling to admit ignorance on any point. Early the next week Sam returned to his duties in the city, and Joshua awaited impatiently the promised lottery papers. Sam did not forget his promise. On the third day after his departure a paper came to the village post-office, directed. [Pg 134] Joshua Drummond, Esq., Stapleton This was promptly taken from the office by Joshua, who had called on an average twice a day for this very paper. It proved to be printed on yellow paper, and fairly bristled with figures, indicating the large sums which were weekly distributed all over the country by the benevolent managers of the lottery. Here was a scheme in which the principal prize was but a thousand dollars. However, the tickets were but a dollar each, and a thousand dollars for one was certainly a handsome return for a small outlay. There were others, however, in which the principal prize was five thousand dollars, and the tickets were, in due proportion, five dollars each. Joshua went off to a somewhat secluded place, for he did not wish to be interrupted, and eagerly read the paper through from beginning to end. Certainly the representations made were of a very seductive character. One might suppose, from reading the paragraphs sandwiching the several schemes, that the[Pg 135] chances were strongly in favor of every holder of a ticket drawing a prize, though a little calculation would have shown that the chances of drawing even the smallest prize were scarcely more than one in a hundred. Here, for instance, is one of the paragraphs:— \"A mechanic in a country town in New York State met with an accident which confined him to his home for three months. He had a large family of children, and had never been able to lay up any money. The consequence was, that the family was reduced to great distress, and he saw no resource except to try to borrow a little money, which would create a debt that he might be years in paying off. But fortunately, only a week before the accident, his wife had seen one of our advertisements. She had five dollars by her, which she had intended to appropriate to the purchase of a new dress. Instead of doing this, a happy impulse led her to send for one of our tickets. She concealed this from her husband, however, thinking that he would blame her. What was her joy, when they were reduced to their last dollar, to receive from us intelligence that[Pg 136] she had drawn a prize of two thousand dollars! The joy of the poor family can better be imagined than described. They were enabled at once to purchase the house in which they lived, and thus to lay the foundation of permanent prosperity. Thus, as in numberless other cases, have we been the means of bringing joy to lucky households.\" Now, this story was probably manufactured out of whole cloth. At any rate, even if true, for every such fortunate household there were a hundred to which the lottery had carried disappointment and privation. But of course the lottery managers could not be expected to allude to these, nor did Joshua, as he greedily read such paragraphs, consider them. On the contrary, his imagination and cupidity were both excited, and he was foolish enough to suppose that his chances of success in case he invested would be very good indeed. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3005/82938.html","bookId":296,"book":{"id":296,"title":"Strong and Steady Or, Paddle Your Own Canoe","description":"简介： It\u0027s ever so much better than my roomtwice as big, to begin with.
