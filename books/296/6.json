{"id":23246,"no":6,"title":"CHAPTER V. JACOB DRUMMOND—CONTINUED.","content":"Over Joshua Mr. Drummond had less control than over his wife. The latter gave way meekly to his unreasonable requisitions; but Joshua did not hesitate to make opposition, being as selfish and self-willed as his father, for whom he entertained neither respect nor affection. Joshua looked around him disdainfully. \"Is this Fast Day?\" he asked. \"You know very well that Fast Day comes in April,\" said his father. \"I only judged from the looks of the table,\" said Joshua, not very respectfully. \"You don\u0027t mean that we shall any of us suffer from the gout.\" \"Bread and butter and pie are good enough for anybody,\" said Mr. Drummond, stiffly. \"I don\u0027t see any pie. Excuse me, there is a little,—so little that I did not at first see it.\" [Pg 39] This was too much for Mr. Drummond\u0027s temper. \"Unmannerly boy!\" he exclaimed; \"if you are dissatisfied with the fare you get at home, you can engage board elsewhere.\" \"I would like to,\" muttered Joshua, in a low voice, which his father chose not to hear. In silence he helped himself to bread and butter, and in due time accepted a piece of pie, which Mrs. Drummond made larger at the expense of her own share. Harmony thus being restored, Mr. Drummond remarked, \"I\u0027ve had a telegram to-day from Willoughby.\" \"From Willoughby?\" repeated his wife. \"Isn\u0027t that where your cousin William Conrad lives?\" \"He doesn\u0027t live there any longer. He\u0027s dead.\" \"Dead! When did he die?\" \"I don\u0027t know. Yesterday, I suppose. The funeral is to be day after to-morrow.\" \"Shall you go?\" \"Yes. It will cost me considerable; as much as five dollars or more; but he was my cousin, and it is[Pg 40] my duty to go,\" said Mr. Drummond, with the air of a man who was making a great sacrifice. \"He was rich, wasn\u0027t he?\" asked Joshua, becoming interested. \"Probably worth a hundred thousand dollars,\" said his father, complacently. \"I should think he might have left me something,\" said Joshua. \"He never saw you, Joshua,\" said his mother. \"Joshua stands a better chance of getting a legacy from one who doesn\u0027t know him, than from one who does,\" said Mr. Drummond, with grim pleasantry. \"He leaves children, doesn\u0027t he, Mr. Drummond?\" \"One child—a boy. Let me see, he must be fifteen by this time.\" \"And his mother isn\u0027t living?\" \"No.\" \"Poor boy!\" \"He\u0027ll be a rich boy, Mrs. Drummond, and I\u0027ll tell you what, I shouldn\u0027t wonder if we had a good chance to know him.\" [Pg 41] \"How so?\" \"It\u0027s likely I will be appointed his guardian. I\u0027m the nearest relative, so that will be the most proper course.\" \"Will he come here, then?\" asked Joshua. \"Very probably.\" \"Then I hope you\u0027ll live better, or he won\u0027t stand it.\" \"When I require any advice from you, Joshua, I will apply for it,\" said his father. Joshua inwardly hoped that his father would be appointed guardian, as it might make a difference in the family living; and, besides, if his cousin were rich, he meant to wheedle himself into his confidence, in the hope of future advantage. \"When shall you set out?\" asked Mrs. Drummond. \"To-morrow morning, I think,\" said her husband. \"It will be hard to leave, but it\u0027s due to my cousin\u0027s memory.\" Mr. Drummond had become very punctilious all at once, considering that for the last dozen years Mr. Conrad, who had by no means admired him, had had[Pg 42] little or no communication with him. But then he had died rich, and who knows what sort of a will he had left? At any rate, Jacob began to feel a strong interest in him now. He might have put off going to Willoughby till the morning train on the day of the funeral, for two o\u0027clock was the hour fixed for the last ceremony; but he was in a hurry to learn all he could about the property, and secure, if possible, the guardianship for himself. This was the secret of his willingness to sacrifice time and money out of regard to his cousin\u0027s memory. The next day, therefore, he started, taking with him in his valise a lunch of bread and meat tied up in a piece of brown paper. He didn\u0027t intend to spend any more money than was absolutely necessary on tavern bills. Shortly after his arrival, he called at the house of mourning. \"I am Jacob Drummond, of Stapleton, the cousin of the deceased,\" he explained to Nancy, who opened the door to admit him. \"Is my young relative, Mr. Conrad\u0027s son, at home?\" \"Yes, sir,\" said Nancy, taking an inventory of his[Pg 43] features, and deciding that he was a very disagreeable looking man. \"Will you mention my name to him, and say that I should like to see him?\" Mr. Drummond was ushered into the parlor, where he had a little chance to look around him before Walter appeared. \"It\u0027s all nonsense wasting so much money on furniture,\" he mentally ejaculated. \"The money spent is a dead loss when it might be drawing handsome interest.\" Walter did not long keep him waiting. Mr. Drummond rose at his entrance. \"I suppose you don\u0027t know me,\" he said; \"but I was your father\u0027s nearest living relation.\" \"Mr. Drummond, I believe.\" \"Yes, Jacob Drummond, of Stapleton. You have probably heard your father speak of me?\" \"Yes, sir,\" said Walter. \"I came as soon as I could after getting the telegram. I left my business to take care of itself. I wanted to offer you my sympathy on your sad loss.\" Mr. Drummond\u0027s words were kind, though the [Pg 44]reference to his sacrifice in leaving his business might have been as well left out. Still Walter could not feel as grateful as he wanted to do. Somehow he didn\u0027t fancy Mr. Drummond. \"You are very kind,\" he said. \"I mean to be. You know I\u0027m your nearest relation now. I truly feel for you in your desolate condition, and though it may not be the right time to say it, I must tell you that I hope, when the funeral is over, you will accompany me home, and share our humble hospitality. Mrs. Drummond joins with me in the invitation.\" Mrs. Drummond had not been consulted in the matter, but her husband thought it would sound well to say so. \"I have not had time to think of future arrangements,\" said Walter; \"but I thank you for your invitation.\" Walter did not know the motives which induced Mr. Drummond to extend this invitation, but supposed it to be meant in kindness, and so acknowledged it. \"My son Joshua, too,\" said Mr. Drummond, \"is[Pg 45] longing to make your acquaintance. He is older than you, but not much larger. How old are you?\" \"I am fifteen.\" \"You are well grown of your age; Joshua is eighteen, but he will make a very pleasant companion for you. Let me hope that you will accept my invitation.\" \"Thank you, Mr. Drummond; I will consult my friends about it.\" \"I wonder how much board I could venture to ask,\" thought Mr. Drummond. \"If I am his guardian, I can fix that to suit myself. A hundred thousand dollars would make me a rich man. That is, I could make money from it, without injuring the boy.\" Mr. Drummond asked a few more questions about Mr. Conrad\u0027s sickness and death. Walter answered them, but did not think it necessary to speak of his losses by the Mining Company. Mr. Drummond was a stranger, and not a man to inspire confidence. So Walter told as little as he could. At length the visitor, having exhausted inquiries, rose. \"I shall be here to-morrow,\" he said. \"I am[Pg 46] stopping at the tavern. I shall return to Stapleton after the ceremony. I hope you will make up your mind to go back with me.\" \"I could not be ready so soon,\" answered Walter, doubtfully. \"I can wait till the next day.\" \"That will not be necessary, Mr. Drummond. I shall have no difficulty in making the journey alone, if I conclude to accept your kind invitation.\" Mr. Drummond shook our hero\u0027s hand sympathetically, and at length withdrew. As he went down the avenue, he took a backward glance at the handsome mansion in which his cousin had lived. \"That boy owns all that property,\" he said, half enviously, \"and never worked a day for it. I\u0027ve had to work for all my money. But it was foolish to spend so much money on a house. A third the sum would have built a comfortable house, and the rest might have been put at interest. If it turns out that I am the boy\u0027s guardian, I think I shall sell it. That\u0027ll be the best course.\" With these reflections Mr. Drummond pursued his way back to the village tavern, where he had taken[Pg 47] the precaution to ascertain that he should be charged but a dollar and a quarter a day. He considered that a dollar would have been sufficient, but still it was proper to make some sacrifice to his cousin\u0027s memory. Mr. Conrad\u0027s mining speculation was not generally known in the village as yet, so that Mr. Drummond did not hear a word as to his loss of property. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3005/82929.html","bookId":296,"book":{"id":296,"title":"Strong and Steady Or, Paddle Your Own Canoe","description":"简介： It\u0027s ever so much better than my roomtwice as big, to begin with.
