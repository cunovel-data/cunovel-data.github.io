{"id":23258,"no":18,"title":"CHAPTER XVII. JOSHUA\u0027S DISAPPOINTMENT.","content":"In due time, to Joshua\u0027s great delight, the lottery ticket reached him. It was several days in coming, and he had almost given it up, but the sight of it raised his spirits to the highest pitch. It seemed to him the first step to a fortune. He began at once to indulge in dazzling visions of what he would do when the prize came to hand; how the \"old man\" would be astonished and treat him with increased respect; how he would go to the city and have a good time seeing the lions, and from henceforth throw off the galling yoke of dependence which his father\u0027s parsimony had made it so hard to bear. Whenever he was by himself, he used to pull out the ticket and gaze at it with the greatest satisfaction, as the key that was to unlock the portals of Fortune, Independence, and Happiness. He had been afraid that his appropriation of five[Pg 156] dollars would be detected, and every time his father entered the house he looked into his face with some apprehension; but days rolled by, and nothing was heard. He congratulated himself that he had been able to sell the shawl for precisely the sum he needed, otherwise the money might have been missed that very night. As it was, neither the shawl nor the bill had been missed. About this time he received a letter from Sam Crawford, describing the gayeties of the city. It closed thus:— \"By the way, Josh, when are you coming up to the city, to take a look at the lions? It\u0027s a shame that a young man of your age should be cooped up in an insignificant little village like Stapleton. I wouldn\u0027t exchange the knowledge of the world I have obtained here for five hundred dollars! What a green rustic I was when I first came here! But it didn\u0027t take me long to find the way round, and now I know the ropes as well as the next man. I generally play billiards in the evening, and, if I do say it myself, I am rather hard to beat. When you come up, I\u0027ll give you a few lessons. I can\u0027t help pitying[Pg 157] you for leading such a slow, humdrum life in the country. I should be moped to death if I were in your place. Can\u0027t you induce the old man to fork over the stamps, and come up here, if only for a week?\" This letter had the effect of making Joshua very much disgusted with Stapleton. Brilliant visions of city life and city enjoyments flitted before his eyes, and he felt that nothing was needed to make a man of him except the knowledge of life which a city residence would be sure to give. \"It\u0027s all true what Sam says,\" he soliloquized. \"A man can\u0027t learn anything of life here. No wonder he looks upon me as a green rustic. How can I be anything else in this miserable little village? But as for the old man\u0027s paying my expenses on a visit, he\u0027s too mean for that. But then there is the lottery ticket. Just as soon as I get hold of my prize, I\u0027ll go on my own hook.\" I append a passage from Joshua\u0027s reply to Sam\u0027s letter:— \"There isn\u0027t any chance of the old man\u0027s forking over stamps enough to pay for my visit to New[Pg 158] York. He\u0027s too thundering mean for that. All he cares for is to make money. But I\u0027m coming, for all that. I\u0027ve bought a lottery ticket, as you advised, and just as soon as I get hold of the prize, I shall come and make you a visit. I should like very much to learn billiards. I wish there was a billiard table in Stapleton, though it wouldn\u0027t do me much good if there were, the old man keeps me so close. I shall be glad when I am twenty-one. I don\u0027t see why he can\u0027t let me have a few thousand dollars then, and set me up in business in the city. Perhaps we could go in together as partners. However, there is no use in talking about him, for he won\u0027t do it. But I may get hold of the money some other way. Would five thousand dollars be enough to set a fellow up in business in New York? \"You will hear from me again soon. I hope I shall be able to write you that I am coming to see you. \"Your friend, \"Joshua Drummond.\" It will be seen that Joshua was willing to go into business for himself, though he did not care to take[Pg 159] a situation. He had the idea, which I think is entertained by a large number of boys and young men, that an employer has nothing to do but to sit at his desk, count over his money, and order his clerks around. For such an employment as this Joshua felt that he was well adapted, and would very much have enjoyed the sense of importance it would give him. But Joshua made a great mistake. Many employers look back upon the years which they passed as clerks as years of comparative leisure and ease, certainly of freedom from anxiety. They find that they have a heavy price to pay for the privilege of being their own masters, and the masters of others. But Joshua was thoroughly lazy, and it was this feeling that dictated the wish which he expressed in his letter to Sam Crawford. The days passed very slowly, it must be acknowledged. Joshua was in a restless and excited state. Though he expected to draw a prize, he knew that there was a remote chance of failing to draw anything, and he wanted the matter decided. But at length the long-expected letter arrived. Joshua did not like to open it in the post-office, lest[Pg 160] it should attract the attention of the postmaster. He therefore withdrew to a place where he was not likely to be disturbed, and with trembling fingers opened the letter. Something dropped out. \"I wonder if it is a check?\" thought Joshua, stooping over and picking it up. But no, it was an announcement of the drawing. Joshua\u0027s numbers,—for each lottery ticket contains three numbers,—were 9, 15, 50. But of the thirteen lucky numbers drawn out of sixty-five, neither of them was one. Slowly it dawned upon Joshua that he had drawn nothing, that his five dollars had been absolutely thrown away. But there was a letter. Perhaps this would explain it. Joshua read as follows:— \"Dear Sir:—We regret to say that we are unable to send you a prize this time. We hope, however, you will not be discouraged. Some of our patrons who have been most fortunate have commenced by being unlucky. Indeed, singularly enough, this is a[Pg 161] general rule. Let us cite an instance. Mr. B——, of your State, bought his first ticket of us last spring. It turned out a blank. We wrote him not to be discouraged, but we did not hear from him for some weeks. Finally he sent us a remittance for a ticket, adding that he sent it with a very faint hope of success. He was convinced that he was born to ill-luck. But what was the result? In less than a fortnight we had the pleasure and gratification of sending him five thousand dollars, minus our usual commission. Suppose he had been discouraged by a first failure, you can see how much he would have lost. \"Hoping to hear from you again, and to send you in return better news, we subscribe ourselves, \"Very respectfully, \"Grabb \u0026 Co.\" The effect of Joshua\u0027s ill success was to make him very despondent. \"It\u0027s all very well to say \u0027Try again,\u0027\" he said to himself, \"but where can I get the money? That five[Pg 162] dollars is thrown away, and I\u0027ve got nothing to show for it.\" He thought of all he had intended to do, and now his castles had crumbled, and all in consequence of this letter. He had been so sanguine of success. Now he must write to Sam that his visit to New York was indefinitely postponed, that is, unless he could induce his father to provide him with money enough to go. The prospect was not very encouraging, but he felt desperate, and he determined to make the attempt. Accordingly, just after supper, he detained his father, just as he was returning to the store, and said:— \"Father, I wish you\u0027d let me go to New York on a visit.\" \"What for?\" asked Mr. Drummond, elevating his brows. \"Because I\u0027m eighteen years old, and I\u0027ve never been there yet.\" \"Then, if you\u0027ve gone eighteen years without seeing the city, I think you can go a while longer,\" said his father, under the impression that he had made[Pg 163] a witty remark. But Joshua did not appreciate the humor of it. \"I\u0027ve lived in Stapleton ever since I was born,\" grumbled Joshua, \"and have got tired of it. I want to see something of life.\" \"Do you? Well, I\u0027m sure I\u0027ve no objection.\" \"May I go then?\" \"Yes.\" \"When?\" asked Joshua, joyfully. \"To-morrow, if you like; but of course you will pay your own expenses.\" \"How can I?\" exclaimed Joshua, in angry disappointment. \"I have no money.\" \"Then you can save up your allowance till you have enough.\" \"Save up on twenty-five cents a week! I couldn\u0027t go till I was an old man!\" \"I know of no other way,\" said Mr. Drummond, with provoking indifference, \"unless you earn the money in some way.\" \"You treat me like a little boy!\" said Joshua, angrily. \"You are better off than I am. I have to work[Pg 164] for all I get. You get your board, clothes, and pocket-money for nothing.\" \"Other boys go to New York when they are much younger.\" \"I have told you you can go when you like, but you mustn\u0027t expect me to supply the money.\" Mr. Drummond put on his hat and crossed the street to the store, leaving Joshua in a very unfilial frame of mind. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3005/82941.html","bookId":296,"book":{"id":296,"title":"Strong and Steady Or, Paddle Your Own Canoe","description":"简介： It\u0027s ever so much better than my roomtwice as big, to begin with.
