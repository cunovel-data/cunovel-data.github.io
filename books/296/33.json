{"id":23273,"no":33,"title":"CHAPTER XXXII. A STRANGE HIDING-PLACE.","content":"Meanwhile Walter had the advantage of quarter of an hour\u0027s start of his pursuer. Jack had indeed been released within five minutes, but he had consumed ten minutes more in searching for the money. It was too dark, however, to make rapid progress. Still Walter pushed on, resolved to put as great a distance as possible between the cabin and himself, for he anticipated pursuit, and judged that, if caught, he would fare badly for the trick he had played upon his host. He had proceeded perhaps half a mile when he stopped to rest. Two or three times he had tripped over projecting roots which the darkness prevented his seeing in time to avoid. \"I\u0027ll rest a few minutes, and then push on,\" he thought. It was late, but the excitement of his position [Pg 307]prevented him from feeling sleepy. He wished to get out of the woods into some road or open field, where he would be in less danger of encountering Jack, and where perhaps he might find assistance against him. He was leaning against an immense tree, one of the largest and oldest in the forest. Walter began idly to examine it. He discovered, by feeling, that it was hollow inside. Curiosity led him to examine farther. He ascertained that the interior was eaten out by gradual decay, making a large hollow space inside. \"I shouldn\u0027t wonder if I could get in,\" he said to himself. He made the attempt, and found that he was correct in his supposition. He could easily stand erect inside. \"That is curious,\" thought Walter. \"The tree must be very old.\" He emerged from the trunk, and once more threw himself down beside it. Five minutes later and his attention was drawn by a sound of approaching footsteps. Then came an oath, which sounded startlingly near. It was uttered by Jack, who had tripped over[Pg 308] a root, and was picking himself up in no very good humor. The enemy, it appeared, was close upon him. Walter started to his feet in dismay. His first thought was immediate flight, but if he were heard by Jack, the latter would no doubt be able to run him down. \"What shall I do?\" thought Walter, in alarm. Quickly the hollow trunk occurred to him. He seized his carpet-bag, and with as little delay as possible concealed himself in the interior. He was just in time, for Jack was by this time only a few rods distant. Walter counted upon his passing on; but on reaching the old tree Jack paused, and said aloud, \"Where can the young rascal be? I wonder if I have passed him? I\u0027ll rest here five minutes. He may straggle along.\" With these words he sank upon the ground, in the very same place where Walter had been reclining two minutes before. He was so near that our hero could have put out his hand and touched him. It was certainly a very uncomfortable situation for[Pg 309] Walter. He hardly dared to breathe or to stir lest his enemy should hear him. \"He\u0027s led me a pretty tramp,\" muttered Jack. \"I\u0027m as tired as a dog, but I\u0027m bound to get hold of him to-night. If I do, I\u0027ll half kill him.\" \"Then I hope you won\u0027t get hold of him,\" Walter ejaculated inwardly. He began to wish he had run on instead of seeking this concealment. In the first case, the darkness of the night would have favored him, and even if Jack had heard him it was by no means certain that he would have caught him. Now an unlucky movement or a cough would betray his hiding-place, and there would be no chance of escape. He began to feel his constrained position irksome, but did not dare to seek relief by change of posture. \"I wish he\u0027d go,\" thought our hero. But Jack was in no hurry. He appeared to wish to waylay Walter, and was constantly listening to catch the sound of his approach. At last a little relief came. A sound was heard, which Jack suspected might proceed from his late guest. He started to his feet, and walked a few steps away.[Pg 310] Walter availed himself of this opportunity to change his position a little. \"It isn\u0027t he,\" said Jack, disappointed. \"Perhaps he\u0027s gone another way.\" He did not throw himself down this time, but remained standing, in evident uncertainty. At length Walter was relieved to hear him say, \"Well, I shan\u0027t catch him by stopping here, that\u0027s sure.\" Then he started, and Walter, listening intently, heard the sound of his receding steps. When sufficient time had elapsed, he ventured out from his concealment, and stopped to consider the situation. What should he do? It was hardly prudent to go on, for it would only bring him nearer to the enemy. If he ventured back, he would be farther away from the edge of the woods, and might encounter Meg, who might also be in pursuit. He did not feel in danger of capture from this quarter, but the woman might find means of communicating with her husband. On the whole, it seemed safest, for the present at least, to stick to[Pg 311] the friendly tree which had proved so good a protector. He stood beside it, watching carefully, intending, whenever peril threatened, to take instant refuge inside. This was not particularly satisfactory, but he hoped Jack would soon tire of the pursuit, and retrace his steps towards the cabin. If he should do that, he would then be safe in continuing his flight. Jack pushed on, believing that our hero was in advance. It had been a fatiguing day, and this made his present midnight tramp more disagreeable. His hopes of overtaking Walter became fainter and fainter, and nature began to assert her rights. A drowsiness which he found it hard to combat assailed him, and he found he must yield to it for a time at least. \"I wish I was at home, and in bed,\" he muttered. \"I\u0027ll lie down and take a short nap, and then start again.\" He threw himself down on the ground, and no longer resisted the approaches of sleep. In five minutes his senses were locked in a deep slumber,[Pg 312] which, instead of a short nap, continued for several hours. While he is sleeping we will go back to Walter. He, too, was sleepy, and would gladly have laid down and slept if he had dared. But he felt the peril of his position too sensibly to give way to his feelings. He watched vigilantly for an hour, but nothing could be seen of Jack. That hour seemed to him to creep with snail-like pace. \"I can\u0027t stand this watching till morning,\" he said to himself. \"I will find some out-of-the-way place, and try to sleep a little.\" Searching about he found such a place as he desired. He lay down, and was soon fast asleep. So pursuer and pursued had yielded to the spell of the same enchantress, and half a mile distant from each other were enjoying welcome repose. Some hours passed away. The sun rose, and its rays lighted up the dim recesses of the forest. When Walter opened his eyes he could not at first remember where he was. He lifted his head from his carpet-bag which he had used as a pillow, and[Pg 313] looked around him in surprise; but recollection quickly came to his aid. \"I must have been sleeping several hours,\" he said to himself, \"for it is now morning. I wonder if the man who was after me has gone home?\" He decided that this was probable, and resolved to make an attempt to reach the edge of the forest. He wanted to get into the region of civilization again, if for no other reason, because he felt hungry, and was likely to remain so as long as he continued in the forest. He now felt fresh and strong, and, taking his carpet-bag in his hand, prepared to start on his journey. But he had scarcely taken a dozen steps when a female figure stepped out from a covert, and he found himself face to face with Meg. Not knowing but that her husband might be close behind, he started back in alarm and hesitation. She observed this, and said, \"You needn\u0027t be afraid, boy. I don\u0027t want to harm you.\" \"Is your husband with you?\" asked Walter, on his guard. \"No, he isn\u0027t. He started out after you before[Pg 314] midnight, and hasn\u0027t been back since. That made me uneasy, and I came out to look for him.\" \"I have seen him,\" said Walter. \"Where and when?\" asked the woman, eagerly. It was strange that such a coarse brute should have inspired any woman with love, but Meg did certainly love her husband, in spite of his frequent bad treatment. \"It must have been within an hour of the time I left your house. He stopped under that tree. That was where I saw him.\" \"Did he see you?\" \"No, I was hidden.\" \"How long did he stay?\" \"Only a few minutes, to get rested, I suppose. Then he went on.\" \"In what direction?\" \"That way.\" \"I am glad he did not harm you. He was so angry when he started that I was afraid of what would happen if he met you. You must keep out of his way.\" [Pg 315] \"That is what I mean to do if I can,\" said Walter. \"Can you tell me the shortest way out of the woods?\" \"Go in that direction,\" said the woman, pointing, \"and half a mile will bring you out.\" \"It is rather hard to follow a straight path in the woods. If you will act as my guide, I will give you a dollar.\" Meg hesitated. \"If my husband should find out that I helped you to escape, he would be very angry.\" \"Why need he know? You needn\u0027t tell him you met me.\" The woman hesitated. Finally love of money prevailed. \"I\u0027ll do it,\" she said, abruptly. \"Follow me.\" She took the lead, and Walter followed closely in her steps. Remembering the night before, he was not wholly assured of her good faith, and resolved to keep his eyes open, and make his escape instantly if he should see any signs of treachery. Possibly[Pg 316] Meg might intend to lead him into a trap, and deliver him up to her husband. He was naturally trustful, but his adventures in the cabin taught him a lesson of distrust. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3005/82956.html","bookId":296,"book":{"id":296,"title":"Strong and Steady Or, Paddle Your Own Canoe","description":"简介： It\u0027s ever so much better than my roomtwice as big, to begin with.
