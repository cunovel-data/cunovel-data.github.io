{"id":23269,"no":29,"title":"CHAPTER XXVIII. STRANGE ACQUAINTANCES.","content":"An hour passed without a word being spoken by his singular hostess. She went to the window from time to time, and looked out as if expecting some one. At length Walter determined to break the silence, which had become oppressive. It did not seem natural for two persons to be in the same room so long without speaking a word. \"I should think you would find it lonely living in the woods away from any neighbors,\" he said. \"I don\u0027t care for neighbors,\" said the woman, shortly. \"Have you lived here long?\" \"That\u0027s as people reckon time,\" was the answer. Walter found himself no wiser than before, and the manner of his hostess did not encourage him to pursue his inquiries further on that subject. [Pg 267] \"You don\u0027t have far to go for fuel,\" was the next remark of our hero. \"Any fool might see that,\" said the woman. \"Not very polite,\" thought Walter. He relapsed into silence, judging that his hostess did not care to converse. Soon, however, she began to ask questions. \"Did you say you was a book-peddler?\" she inquired. \"I am a book-agent.\" \"Where are your books,—in that carpet-bag?\" \"No, I have sold all my books, and sent for some more.\" \"Where did you sell them?\" \"In C——.\" \"Have you come from there?\" \"Yes, I started from there this forenoon.\" \"Where did you stop?\" \"At the tavern.\" \"Is your business a good one?\" she asked, eying him attentively. \"I have done very well so far, but then I have been at it only a week.\" [Pg 268] \"It\u0027s a good thing to have money,\" said the woman, more to herself than to Walter. \"Yes,\" said Walter, \"it\u0027s very convenient to have money; but there are other things that are better.\" \"Such as what?\" demanded the woman abruptly. \"Good health for one thing.\" \"What else?\" \"A good conscience.\" She laughed scornfully. \"I\u0027ll tell you there\u0027s nothing so good as money. I\u0027ve wanted it all my life, and never could get it. Do you think I would live here in the woods if I had money? No, I should like to be a lady, and wear fine clothes, and drive about in a handsome carriage. Why are some people so lucky, while I live in this miserable hole?\" She looked at Walter fiercely, as if she held him responsible for her ill-fortune. \"Perhaps your luck will change some day,\" he said, though he had little faith in his own words. He wondered how the tall, gaunt woman of the backwoods would look dressed in silks and satins. \"My luck never will change,\" she said, quickly. [Pg 269] \"I must live and die in some such hovel as this.\" \"My luck has changed,\" said Walter, quietly; \"but in a different way.\" \"How?\" she asked, betraying in her tone some curiosity. \"A year ago—six months ago—my father was a rich man, or was considered so. He was thought to be worth over a hundred thousand dollars. All at once his property was swept away, and now I am obliged to earn my own living, as you see.\" \"Is that true?\" she asked. \"Yes, it is true.\" \"How did your father lose his money?\" \"By speculating in mines.\" \"The more fool he!\" \"My father is dead,\" said Walter, gravely. \"I cannot bear to hear him blamed.\" \"Humph!\" ejaculated the woman; but what she intended to convey by this utterance Walter could not tell. Again the woman went to the window and looked out. [Pg 270] \"It\u0027s time for Jack to be here,\" she said. \"Your son?\" asked Walter. \"No, my husband.\" \"He\u0027ll be pretty wet when he comes in,\" Walter ventured to say; but his remark elicited no response. After a while his hostess said, in her usual abrupt tone, \"I expect you are hungry.\" \"Yes,\" said Walter, \"I am, but I can wait till your husband comes.\" \"I don\u0027t know when he\u0027ll come. Likely he\u0027s kept.\" She took out from a small cupboard a plate of bread and some cold meat, and laid them on the table. Then she steeped some tea, and, when it was ready, she put that also on the table. \"Set up,\" she said, briefly. Walter understood from this that supper was ready, and, putting on his shoes, which were now dry, he moved his chair up. \"Likely you\u0027re used to something better,\" said the woman. This was true, but our hero politely said that the supper looked very good, and he did not doubt he would enjoy it. [Pg 271] \"That\u0027s lucky, for it\u0027s all you will get,\" said the woman. \"There\u0027s not much use in wasting politeness on her,\" thought Walter. \"She won\u0027t give any in return, that\u0027s certain.\" The woman poured him out some tea in one of the cracked cups. \"We haven\u0027t got no milk nor sugar,\" she said. \"My man and I don\u0027t care for them.\" The first sip of the tea, which was quite strong, nearly caused a wry expression on Walter\u0027s face, but he managed to control himself so far as not to betray his want of relish for the beverage his hostess offered him. The only redeeming quality it had was that it was hot, and, exposed as he had been to the storm, warm drink was agreeable. \"There\u0027s some bread and there\u0027s some meat,\" said the woman. \"You can help yourself.\" \"Are you not going to eat supper with me?\" asked Walter. \"No, I shall wait for Jack.\" She sat down in a chair before the fire, leaving[Pg 272] Walter to take care of himself, and seemed plunged in thought. \"What a strange woman!\" thought Walter. \"I wonder if her husband is anything like her. If he is, they must be an agreeable couple.\" He ate heartily of the food, and succeeded in emptying his cup of tea. He would have taken another cup if there had been milk and sugar, but it was too bitter to be inviting. \"Will you have some more tea?\" asked the hostess, turning round. \"No, I thank you.\" \"You miss the milk and sugar?\" \"I like them in tea.\" \"We can\u0027t afford to buy them, so it\u0027s lucky we don\u0027t like them.\" There was a bitterness in her tone whenever she talked of money, which led Walter to avoid the topic. Evidently she was a discontented woman, angry because her lot in life was not brighter. Walter pushed his chair from the table, and sat down again before the fire. She rose and cleared[Pg 273] the table, replacing the bread and meat in the cupboard. \"Where are you going next?\" she asked, after a pause. Walter mentioned the name of the place. \"Have you ever been there?\" he asked. \"Yes.\" \"Is it a flourishing place?\" \"Yes, good enough, but I haven\u0027t been there for a year. It may have burned down for all I know.\" \"I wonder what sort of a woman she was when she was young?\" thought Walter. \"I wonder if she was always so unsociable?\" There was silence for another hour. Walter wished it were time to go to bed, for the presence of such a woman made him feel uncomfortable. But it was too early yet to suggest retiring. At length the silence was broken by a step outside. \"That\u0027s Jack,\" said the woman, rising hastily; and over her face there came a transient gleam of satisfaction, the first Walter had observed. Before she could reach the door it was opened,[Pg 274] and Jack entered. Walter looked up with some curiosity to see what sort of a man the husband of this woman might be. He saw a stout man, with a face like a bull-dog\u0027s, lowering eyes, and matted red hair and beard. \"They are fitly mated,\" thought our hero. The man stopped short as his glance rested upon Walter, and he turned quickly to his wife. \"Who have you got here, Meg?\" he asked, in a rough voice. \"He was overtaken by the storm, and wanted me to take him in, and give him supper and lodging.\" \"He\u0027s a boy. What brings him into these woods?\" \"He says he\u0027s a book-peddler.\" \"Where are his books?\" \"I have sold them all,\" said Walter, feeling called upon to take a personal share in the conversation. \"How many did you have?\" \"Twenty.\" \"How much did you charge for them?\" \"Three dollars and a half apiece.\" \"That\u0027s seventy dollars, isn\u0027t it?\" \"Yes.\" [Pg 275] \"Well, you can stay here all night if you want to. We aint used to keepin\u0027 a tavern, but you\u0027ll fare as well as we.\" \"Thank you. I was afraid I might have to stay out all night.\" \"Now, Meg, get me something to eat quick. I\u0027m most famished.\" While his wife was getting out the supper again, he sat down beside the fire, and Walter had a chance to scan his rough features. There was something in his appearance that inspired distrust, and our hero wished the night were past, and he were again on his way. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3005/82952.html","bookId":296,"book":{"id":296,"title":"Strong and Steady Or, Paddle Your Own Canoe","description":"简介： It\u0027s ever so much better than my roomtwice as big, to begin with.
