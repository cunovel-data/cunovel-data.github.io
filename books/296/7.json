{"id":23247,"no":7,"title":"CHAPTER VI. FUTURE PLANS.","content":"The funeral was over. Mr. Drummond, as indeed his relationship permitted, was one of the principal mourners. Considering that he had not seen Mr. Conrad for five years preceding his death, nor during that time communicated with him in any way, he appeared to be very much overcome by grief. He kept his eyes covered with a large white handkerchief, and his movements indicated suppressed agitation. He felt that this was a tribute due to a cousin who had left over one hundred thousand dollars. When they had returned from the grave, Mr. Drummond managed to have a word with Walter. \"Have you decided to accept my offer, and make your home beneath my humble roof?\" he asked. \"There has been no time to consult with my friends here, Mr. Drummond. I will let you know[Pg 49] next week. I thank you at any rate for your kindness.\" \"Do come, Walter,\" said his cousin, twisting his mean features into an affectionate smile. \"With you beneath my humble roof, I shall want nothing to complete my happiness.\" Walter thanked him again, wondering at the same time why Mr. Drummond\u0027s kindness did not affect him more sensibly. So Jacob Drummond went back to Stapleton, still ignorant of the state of Mr. Conrad\u0027s affairs, and still regarding Walter as a boy of great wealth. When the will was opened it was found to bear date two years back, before Mr. Conrad had plunged into the speculation which had proved so disastrous to him. He bequeathed all the property which he did possess to Walter, with the exception of five hundred dollars, which were left as a legacy to his faithful house-keeper, Nancy Forbes. At the time the will was made, its provisions made Walter heir to a large fortune. Now it was quite uncertain how things would turn out. Clement Shaw, the village[Pg 50] lawyer, an honest and upright man, was made executor, being an old and tried friend of the deceased. With him Walter had a long and confidential conversation, imparting to him what he knew of his father\u0027s mining speculation and its disastrous result, with its probable effect in accelerating his death. \"I knew something of this before, Walter,\" said Mr. Shaw. \"Your father spoke to me of being largely interested in the Great Metropolitan Mining Company; but of the company itself and the extent to which he was involved I knew nothing.\" \"I think my father must have been very seriously involved,\" said Walter. \"It may, perhaps, swallow up the whole property.\" \"Let us hope not. Indeed, I can hardly believe that your father would have ventured in so deep as that.\" \"He had every confidence in the company; he thought he was going to double his money. If only a part of his property was threatened, I don\u0027t think it would have had such an effect upon him.\" \"I will thoroughly examine into the affair,\" said Mr. Shaw. \"Meanwhile, Walter, hope for the best![Pg 51] It can hardly be that the whole property is lost. Do not be too anxious.\" \"Do not fear for me on that account,\" said Walter. \"I always looked forward to being rich, it is true, but I can bear poverty. If the worst comes, and I am penniless, I am strong, and can work. I can get along as well as thousands of other boys, who have to support themselves.\" Walter did not speak boastfully, but in a calm, confident way, that argued a consciousness of power. \"Yes,\" said the lawyer, regarding him attentively, \"I think you are right there. You are just the boy who can make his own way; but I hope you will not be obliged to do so.\" \"There is one thing I want to say, Mr. Shaw,\" said Walter, \"and that is about the money my father leaves in his will to Nancy.\" \"The circumstances were different. She will not expect it now; that is, of course, unless things turn out more favorably than we fear.\" \"That is not what I mean. Nancy must have the money, if there is so much left after settling the estate.\" [Pg 52] \"But suppose only five hundred dollars are left? Of course I hope it will be much more, but we must think of all contingencies.\" \"If only five hundred dollars are left, let Nancy have them.\" \"But, Walter, consider yourself.\" \"I am young and strong. Nancy has spent her best years in my father\u0027s service, and she is no longer young. It is right that she should have some provision. Besides, my father meant her to have it, and I want to carry out his wishes.\" \"This is all very generous, Walter; but I am afraid it is inconsiderate. It would not be your father\u0027s wish to provide even for Nancy, however faithful she may have been, at the expense of his son.\" \"It is right,\" said Walter. \"Besides, Mr. Shaw, I find that Nancy had laid up six hundred dollars, which she had deposited in my father\u0027s hands. That also must be paid, if there is enough to pay it; if not, I will take it upon myself to pay whenever I am able.\" \"You\u0027re an excellent boy, Walter,\" said Mr.[Pg 53] Shaw. \"I always had a good opinion of you, and I find it is more than deserved. I honor you for the resolution you have expressed, though I cannot quite agree with you about the five hundred dollars. As to the debt, that must be paid, if there is money enough to pay it. But we can leave the further discussion of this question for the present. Now let us consider what is to become of you in the mean time. You were at the Essex Classical Institute, I believe?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"You would like to go back again, I suppose.\" \"No, Mr. Shaw. It is an expensive school, and while it is uncertain how my father\u0027s affairs will come out, I should not feel justified in going there.\" \"Perhaps you are right. Of course you cannot stay here, and keep house by yourself. I would invite you to my own house, but my wife is an invalid, and I have to consider her in the matter.\" \"Thank you, Mr. Shaw; but I think perhaps I had better accept the offer of Mr. Drummond, of Stapleton. He invites me to make my home at his[Pg 54] house, and, for the present, perhaps, that will be the best arrangement.\" \"I am not acquainted with Mr. Drummond. He is a relation, I believe.\" \"Yes, he is my father\u0027s cousin, and so, of course, my second cousin.\" \"I think I saw him at the funeral.\" \"Yes, he was present.\" Mr. Shaw had seen Jacob Drummond, and had not been very favorably impressed by his appearance. Still, his offer was not one to be hastily rejected, for no better reason than a little prejudice, which might prove unfounded. Accordingly he said, \"Well, Walter, as you say, I am not sure whether this may not be the best arrangement for you, that is, for the present. If you don\u0027t like to stay at Stapleton, you can write me, and I will see what I can do for you.\" \"Thank you, Mr. Shaw.\" Nancy was much troubled at the thought of parting from Walter, whom she had known from his infancy; but a situation was immediately offered her in the village, and Walter promised to take her as his house-keeper whenever he had a home of his own, and[Pg 55] this comforted her, although it was likely to be a long time first, since our hero was at present but fifteen. \"Your six hundred dollars shall be paid, Nancy,\" said Walter, \"as soon as father\u0027s affairs are settled.\" \"Don\u0027t bother yourself about that, Master Walter,\" said Nancy. \"I\u0027ve got fifty dollars in my trunk, and I don\u0027t need the other at all. I can wait for it five years.\" \"It won\u0027t be necessary to wait as long as that, Nancy.\" \"And so you are going to that Mr. Drummond\u0027s? I\u0027m sorry for it. I don\u0027t like the man\u0027s looks at all.\" \"He may be a good man. He was kind to invite me.\" \"He isn\u0027t a good man,\" said Nancy, positively. \"He\u0027s got a mean sort of look to his face.\" \"You mustn\u0027t try to prejudice me before I go to him, Nancy.\" \"You\u0027ll think as I do before you\u0027ve been there a week,\" said Nancy, shaking her head. \"I took a good look at him when he was here, and I didn\u0027t like his looks.\" [Pg 56] \"He isn\u0027t very handsome,\" said Walter, smiling; \"but everybody can\u0027t be handsome.\" Secretly he did not wonder much at Nancy\u0027s prejudice. Mr. Drummond certainly was a mean-looking man. How he could be so nearly related to his father, who was a generous, open-handed, and open-hearted man, was surprising. Still Walter was just enough to reserve his judgment until his opportunities of judging were greater than at present. He wrote a brief letter to Stapleton, to the following effect:— \"Mr. Drummond:— \"Dear Sir:—I will accept the invitation you were kind enough to extend to me, for the present, at least, and will come to Stapleton about the middle of next week. You are the only relation of my father that I know of, and I think it would be his wish that I should go to you. If it should be inconvenient for you to receive me at that time, please write me at once. \"Yours, respectfully, \"Walter Conrad.\" In return, Walter received a letter couched in the most cordial terms, in which Mr. Drummond signed himself, \"Your affectionate cousin.\" He was delighted, he said, to think that he was about to receive, under his humble roof, the son of his revered and lamented cousin. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3005/82930.html","bookId":296,"book":{"id":296,"title":"Strong and Steady Or, Paddle Your Own Canoe","description":"简介： It\u0027s ever so much better than my roomtwice as big, to begin with.
