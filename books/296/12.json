{"id":23252,"no":12,"title":"CHAPTER XI. JOSHUA STIRS UP THE WRONG CUSTOMER.","content":"When Walter went into the house to dinner, the appearance of the table indicated the truth of what Joshua had told him. Since Mr. Drummond had ascertained the pecuniary position of his visitor, he no longer felt it incumbent upon him to keep up appearances. Corned beef and potatoes, and bread without butter, constituted the mid-day meal. This certainly differed considerably from the supper and breakfast of which Walter had partaken. \"Sit right down, Conrad,\" said Mr. Drummond. \"Eat your dinner as fast as you can, and go back to the store.\" It did not take Walter long to eat his dinner. Corned beef he had never liked, though now, having no choice, he managed to eat a little. \"If you\u0027re through, you needn\u0027t wait for me,\" said Mr. Drummond. \"We don\u0027t stand on ceremony[Pg 99] here. Tell Nichols he may go to his dinner. I\u0027ll be right over; so, if there are any customers you can\u0027t wait on, ask them to wait.\" In the evening Walter found that his carpet-bag had been removed from the spare chamber to a small, uncarpeted back room, furnished with the barest necessaries. He smiled to himself. \"I shan\u0027t be in danger of forgetting my change of circumstances,\" he said to himself. He was tired, however, and, though the bed was harder than he had ever before slept on, he managed to sleep soundly. He was waked up early by Mr. Drummond. \"Hurry up, Conrad!\" said that gentleman, unceremoniously. \"I want you to be up within fifteen minutes to open the store.\" Walter jumped out of bed and hurriedly dressed. His position was so new that he did not at first realize it. When he did reflect that he was working for his board in a country store, he hardly knew whether to feel glad or sorry. He had begun to earn his living, and this was satisfactory; but he was working[Pg 100] for a man whom he could neither like nor respect, and his pay was very poor of its kind. That was not so agreeable. Walter was not a glutton, nor inordinately fond of good living, but he had the appetite of a healthy boy, and when he entered the room where breakfast was spread (this was after he had been in the store an hour), he did wish that there had been something on the table besides the remains of the corned beef and a plate of bread and butter. \"Do you take sugar and milk in your tea, Walter?\" asked Mrs. Drummond. \"If you please.\" \"I don\u0027t take either,\" remarked Mr. Drummond. \"It\u0027s only a habit, and an expensive one. If you\u0027d try going without for a week, you would cure yourself of the habit.\" \"How intolerably mean he is!\" thought Walter, for he understood very well that the only consideration in Mr. Drummond\u0027s mind was the expense. \"I don\u0027t think I shall ever learn to go without milk and sugar,\" said Walter, quietly, not feeling[Pg 101] disposed to humor his employer in this little meanness. \"There isn\u0027t anything fit to eat on the table,\" grumbled Joshua, looking about him discontentedly. \"You are always complaining,\" said his father, sharply. \"If you earned your breakfast, you wouldn\u0027t be so particular.\" \"Why can\u0027t you have beefsteak once in a while, instead of corned beef? I\u0027m sick to death of corned beef.\" \"We shall have some beefsteak on Sunday morning, and not till then. I don\u0027t mean to pamper your appetite.\" \"That\u0027s so!\" said Joshua. \"Not much danger of that.\" \"If you are not satisfied, you can go without.\" \"I will, then,\" said Joshua, rising from the table. He knew very well that as soon as his father had gone to the store he could get something better from his mother. It had been a considerable disappointment to Joshua to find that Walter was poor instead of rich, for he had proposed to make as free use of Walter\u0027s[Pg 102] purse as the latter would permit. Even now it occurred to him that Walter might have a supply of ready money, a part of which he might borrow. He accordingly took an opportunity during the day to sound our hero on this subject. \"Walter, have you a couple of dollars about you to lend me for a day or two?\" he asked, in a tone of assumed carelessness. \"Yes, I have that amount of money, but I am afraid I must decline lending.\" \"Why shouldn\u0027t you lend me? It\u0027s only for a day or two.\" But Walter knew very well Joshua\u0027s small allowance, and that he would not be able to return a loan of that amount, even if he were desirous of so doing, and he judged Joshua so well that he doubted whether he would have any such desire. \"You know my circumstances, Joshua,\" he said, \"and that I am in no position to lend anybody money.\" \"Two dollars isn\u0027t much. You said you had it.\" \"Yes, I have it; but I must take care of what little I have. I am working for my board, as you[Pg 103] know, and have got to provide for all my other expenses myself; therefore I shall need all my money.\" \"You talk as if I wanted you to give me the money. I only asked you to lend it.\" \"That\u0027s about the same thing,\" thought Walter; but he only said, \"Why don\u0027t you ask your father for the money?\" \"Because he wouldn\u0027t give it to me. He\u0027s as mean as dirt.\" \"Then where would you get the money to repay me in case I lent it to you?\" \"You\u0027re just as mean as he is,\" exclaimed Joshua, angrily, not caring to answer this question. \"A mighty fuss you make about lending a fellow a couple of dollars!\" \"It makes no particular difference to me whether you think me mean or not,\" said Walter. \"I have got to be richer than I am now before I lend money.\" Joshua stalked away in a fret, angry that Walter would not permit himself to be swindled. From that time he cherished a dislike to our hero, and this he showed by various little slights and annoyances, of[Pg 104] which Walter took little notice. He thoroughly despised Joshua for his meanness and selfishness, and it mattered very little to him what such a boy thought of him. This forbearance Joshua utterly misinterpreted. He decided that Walter was deficient in courage and spirit, and it encouraged him to persevere in his system of petty annoyances until they might almost be called bullying. Though Walter kept quiet under these provocations, there was often a warning flash of the eye which showed that it would not be safe to go too far. But this Joshua did not notice, and persisted. \"Joshua,\" said his mother one day, \"I really think you don\u0027t treat Walter right. You are not polite to him.\" \"Why should I be? What is he but a beggar?\" \"He is not that, for he works for his living.\" \"At any rate he\u0027s a mean fellow, and I shall treat him as I please.\" But one day matters came to a climax. One afternoon there were a few young fellows standing on the piazza in front of Mr. Drummond\u0027s[Pg 105] store. Joshua was one of them, and there being no customers to wait upon, Walter also had joined the company. They were discussing plans for a picnic to be held in the woods on the next Saturday afternoon. It was to be quite a general affair. \"You will come, Walter, won\u0027t you?\" asked one of the number. \"No,\" said Joshua; \"he can\u0027t come.\" \"I didn\u0027t authorize you to speak for me,\" said Walter, quietly. \"You didn\u0027t authorize me to speak for you?\" repeated Joshua, in a mocking tone. \"Big words for a beggar!\" \"What do you mean by calling me a beggar?\" demanded Walter, quietly, but with rising color. \"I don\u0027t choose to give you any explanation,\" said Joshua, scornfully. \"You\u0027re only my father\u0027s hired boy, working for your board.\" \"That may be true, but I am not a beggar, and I advise you not to call me one again.\" Walter\u0027s tone was still quiet, and Joshua wholly misunderstood him; otherwise, being a coward at heart, he would have desisted. [Pg 106] \"I\u0027ll say it as often as I please,\" he repeated. \"You\u0027re a beggar, and if we hadn\u0027t taken pity on you, you\u0027d have had to go to the poor-house.\" Walter was not quarrelsome; but this last insult, in presence of half-a-dozen boys between his own age and Joshua\u0027s, roused him. \"Joshua Drummond,\" he said, \"you\u0027ve insulted me long enough, and I\u0027ve stood it, for I didn\u0027t want to quarrel; but I will stand it no longer.\" He walked up to Joshua, and struck him in the face, not a hard blow, but still a blow. Joshua turned white with passion, and advanced upon our hero furiously, with the intention of giving him, as he expressed it, the worst whipping he ever had. Walter parried his blow, and put in another, this time sharp and stinging. Joshua was an inch or two taller, but Walter was more than a match for him. Joshua threw out his arms, delivering his blows at random, and most of them failed of effect. Indeed, he was so blinded with rage, that Walter, who kept cool, had from this cause alone a great advantage over him. Joshua at length seized him, and he was[Pg 107] compelled to throw him down. As Joshua lay prostrate, with Walter\u0027s knee upon his breast, Mr. Drummond, who had gone over to his own house, appeared upon the scene. \"What\u0027s all this?\" he demanded in mingled surprise and anger. \"Conrad, what means this outrageous conduct?\" Walter rose, and, turning to his employer, said, manfully, \"Joshua insulted me, sir, and I have punished him. That\u0027s all!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3005/82935.html","bookId":296,"book":{"id":296,"title":"Strong and Steady Or, Paddle Your Own Canoe","description":"简介： It\u0027s ever so much better than my roomtwice as big, to begin with.
