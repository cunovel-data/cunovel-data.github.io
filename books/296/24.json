{"id":23264,"no":24,"title":"CHAPTER XXIII. WALTER LOSES HIS MONEY.","content":"Walter, by advice of Mr. Pusher, bought a ticket to Cleveland. There was a resident agent in this city, and a depository of books published by the firm. As Walter would be unable to carry with him as large a supply of books as he needed, he was authorized to send to the Cleveland agency when he got out, and the books would be sent him by express. \"I will give you a letter to Mr. Greene, our agent in Cleveland,\" said Mr. Pusher, \"and you can consult him as to your best field of operations.\" The letter was hastily written and handed to Walter. \"Good-by, Mr. Pusher,\" he said, preparing to leave the office. \"Good-by, my young friend. I shall hope to hear good accounts from you.\" [Pg 217] So Walter went downstairs, and emerged into the street. He had no particular motive for remaining in New York, and felt eager to commence work. So he went at once to the Erie railway depot, and bought a through ticket to Cleveland, via Buffalo and Niagara Falls. Though he had not much money to spare, he determined not to neglect the opportunity he would have of seeing this great natural wonder, but to stop over a day in order to visit the falls. He selected a comfortable seat by a window, and waited till the train was ready to start. He realized that he had engaged in rather a large enterprise for a boy of fifteen, who had hitherto had all his wants supplied by others. He was about to go a thousand miles from home, to earn his own living,—in other words, to paddle his own canoe. But he did not feel in the least dismayed. He was ambitious and enterprising, and confident that he could earn his living as well as other boys of his age. He had never been far from home, but felt that he should enjoy visiting new and unfamiliar scenes. So he felt decidedly cheerful and hopeful[Pg 218] as the cars whirled him out of the depot, and he commenced his Western journey. Walter put his strip of railway tickets into his vest-pocket, and his porte-monnaie, containing the balance of his money, into the pocket of his pantaloons. He wished to have the tickets at hand when the conductor came round. He sat alone at first, but after a while a lady got in who rode thirty miles or more, and then got out. A little later a young man passed through the cars, looking about him on either side. He paused at Walter\u0027s seat, and inquired, \"Is this seat taken?\" \"No, sir,\" said Walter. \"Then, with your permission, I will take it,\" said the stranger. \"Tiresome work travelling, isn\u0027t it?\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" said Walter. \"I rather like it; but then I never travelled much.\" \"I have to travel a good deal on business,\" said the other, \"and I\u0027ve got tired of it. How many times do you think I have been over this road?\" \"Couldn\u0027t guess.\" [Pg 219] \"This is the fifteenth time. I know it like a book. How far are you going?\" \"To Cleveland.\" \"Got relations there, I suppose?\" \"No,\" said Walter; \"I am going on business.\" He was rather glad to let his companion know that he, too, was in business. \"You\u0027re young to be in business,\" said his companion. \"What sort of business is it?\" \"I am an agent for Flint \u0026 Pusher, a New York firm.\" \"Publishers, aint they?\" \"Yes, sir.\" Walter\u0027s companion was a young man of twenty-five, or possibly a year or two older. He was rather flashily attired, with a cut-away coat and a low-cut vest, double-breasted, across which glittered a massive chain, which might have been gold, or might only have been gilt, since all that glitters is not gold. At any rate, it answered the purpose of making a show. His cravat was showy, and his whole appearance indicated absence of good taste. A cautious employer would scarcely have selected[Pg 220] him from a crowd of applicants for a confidential position. Walter was vaguely conscious of this. Still he had seen but little of the world, and felt incompetent to judge others. \"Are you going right through to Cleveland?\" inquired the stranger. \"No; I think I shall stop at Buffalo. I want to see Niagara Falls.\" \"That\u0027s right. Better see them. They\u0027re stunning.\" \"I suppose you have been there?\" said Walter, with some curiosity. \"Oh, yes, several times. I\u0027ve a great mind to go again and show you round, but I don\u0027t know if I can spare so long a time from business.\" \"I should like your company,\" said Walter, politely; \"but I don\u0027t want to interfere with your engagements.\" \"I\u0027ll think of it, and see how I can arrange matters,\" said the other. Walter was not particularly anxious for the continued society of his present companion. He was willing enough to talk with him, but there was [Pg 221]something in his appearance and manner which prevented his being attracted to him. He turned away and began to view the scenery through which they were passing. The stranger took out a newspaper, and appeared to be reading attentively. Half an hour passed thus without a word being spoken on either side. At length his companion folded up the paper. \"Do you smoke?\" he asked. \"No,\" said Walter. \"I think I\u0027ll go into the smoking-car, and smoke a cigar. I should like to offer you one if you will take one.\" \"No, thank you,\" said Walter; \"I don\u0027t smoke, and I am afraid my first cigar wouldn\u0027t give me much pleasure.\" \"I\u0027ll be back in a few minutes. Perhaps you\u0027d like to look over this paper while I am gone.\" \"Thank you,\" said Walter. He took the paper,—an illustrated weekly,—and looked over the pictures with considerable interest. He had just commenced reading a story when a boy passed through the car with a basket of oranges and apples depending from his arm. [Pg 222] \"Oranges—apples!\" he called out, looking to the right and left in quest of customers. The day was warm, and through the open window dust had blown into the car. Walter\u0027s throat felt parched, and the oranges looked tempting. \"How much are your oranges?\" he inquired. \"Five cents apiece, or three for a dime,\" answered the boy. \"I\u0027ll take three,\" said Walter, reflecting that he could easily dispose of two himself, and considering that it would only be polite to offer one to his companion, whose paper he was reading, when he should return. \"Here are three nice ones,\" said the boy, picking them out, and placing them in our hero\u0027s hands. Walter felt in his vest-pocket, thinking he had a little change there. He proved to be mistaken. There was nothing in that pocket except his railway tickets. Next, of course, he felt for his porte-monnaie, but he felt for it in vain. He started in surprise. [Pg 223] \"I thought my pocket-book was in that pocket,\" he reflected. \"Can it be in the other?\" He felt in the other pocket, but search here was equally fruitless. He next felt nervously in the pocket of his coat, though he was sure he couldn\u0027t have put his porte-monnaie there. Then it flashed upon him, with a feeling of dismay, that he had lost his pocket-book and all his remaining money. How or where, he could not possibly imagine, for the suddenness of the discovery quite bewildered him. \"I won\u0027t take the oranges,\" he said to the boy. \"I can\u0027t find my money.\" The boy, who had made sure of a sale, took back the fruit reluctantly, and passed on, crying out, \"Here\u0027s your oranges and apples!\" Walter set about thinking what had become of his money. The more he thought, the more certain he felt that he had put his porte-monnaie in the pocket in which he had first felt for it. Why was it not there now? That was a question which he felt utterly incompetent to answer. \"Have you lost anything?\" inquired a gentleman who sat just behind Walter. Looking back, he[Pg 224] found that it was a gentleman of fifty who addressed him. \"Yes, sir,\" he said, \"I have lost my pocket-book.\" \"Was there much money in it?\" \"About forty dollars, sir.\" \"That is too much to lose. Was your ticket in it also?\" \"No, sir; that I have in my vest-pocket.\" \"Where was your pocket-book when you last saw it?\" inquired the gentleman. \"In this pocket, sir.\" \"Humph!\" commented the other. \"Who was that young man who was sitting with you a few minutes since?\" \"I don\u0027t know, sir.\" \"He was a stranger, then?\" \"Yes, sir; I never met him till this morning.\" \"Then I think I can tell you where your money has gone.\" \"Where, sir?\" demanded Walter, beginning to understand him. \"I think your late companion was a pickpocket,[Pg 225] and relieved you of it, while he pretended to be reading. I didn\u0027t like his appearance much.\" \"I don\u0027t see how he could have done it without my feeling his hand in my pocket.\" \"They understand their business, and can easily relieve one of his purse undetected. I once had my watch stolen without being conscious of it. Your porte-monnaie was in the pocket towards the man, and you were looking from the window. It was a very simple thing to relieve you of it.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3005/82947.html","bookId":296,"book":{"id":296,"title":"Strong and Steady Or, Paddle Your Own Canoe","description":"简介： It\u0027s ever so much better than my roomtwice as big, to begin with.
