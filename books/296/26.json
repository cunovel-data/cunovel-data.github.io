{"id":23266,"no":26,"title":"CHAPTER XXV. A HARD CUSTOMER.","content":"Walter stopped long enough at Buffalo to visit Niagara Falls, as he had intended. Though he enjoyed the visit, and found the famous cataract fully up to his expectations, no incident occurred during the visit which deserves to be chronicled here. He resumed his journey, and arrived in due time at Cleveland. He had no difficulty in finding the office of Mr. Greene, the agent of Messrs. Flint \u0026 Pusher. He found that this gentleman, besides his agency, had a book and stationery business of his own. \"I don\u0027t go out myself,\" he said to Walter; \"but I keep a supply of Flint\u0027s books on hand, and forward them to his agents as called for. Have you done much in the business?\" \"No, sir, I am only a beginner. I have done nothing yet.\" [Pg 237] \"I thought not. You look too young.\" \"Mr. Pusher told me I had better be guided by your advice.\" \"I\u0027ll advise you as well as I can. First, I suppose you want to know where to go.\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"You had better go fifty miles off at least. The immediate neighborhood has been pretty well canvassed. There\u0027s C—— now, a flourishing and wealthy town. Suppose you go there first.\" \"Very well, sir.\" \"It\u0027s on the line of railway. Two hours will carry you there.\" \"I\u0027ll go, this afternoon.\" \"You are prompt.\" \"I want to get to work as soon as possible.\" \"I commend your resolution. It speaks well for your success.\" Walter arrived in C—— in time for supper. He went to a small public house, where he found that he could board for a dollar and a half a day, or seven dollars by the week. He engaged a week\u0027s board, reflecting that he could probably work to advantage a[Pg 238] week in so large a place, or, if not, that five days at the daily rate would amount to more than the weekly terms. He did not at first propose to do anything that evening until it occurred to him that he might perhaps dispose of a copy of his book to the landlord in part payment for his board. He went into the public room after supper. \"Are you travelling alone?\" asked the landlord, who had his share of curiosity. \"Yes,\" said Walter. \"Not on business?\" \"Yes, on business.\" \"What might it be now? You are rather young to be in business.\" \"I am a book-agent.\" \"Meeting with pretty good success?\" \"I\u0027m just beginning,\" said Walter, smiling. \"If you\u0027ll be my first customer, I\u0027ll stop with you a week.\" \"What kind of a book have you got?\" Walter showed it. It was got up in the usual style[Pg 239] of subscription books, with abundance of illustrations. \"It\u0027s one of the best books we ever sent out,\" said Walter, in a professional way. \"Just look at the number of pictures. If you\u0027ve got any children, they\u0027ll like it; and, if you haven\u0027t, it will be just the book for your centre-table.\" \"I see you know how to talk,\" said the landlord, smiling. \"What is the price?\" \"Three dollars and a half.\" \"That\u0027s considerable.\" \"But you know I\u0027m going to take it out in board.\" \"Well, that\u0027s a consideration, to be sure. A man doesn\u0027t feel it so much as if he took the money out of his pocket and paid cash down. What do you say, Mrs. Burton?\" addressing his wife, who just then entered the room. \"This young man wants to stay here a week, and pay partly in a book he is agent for. Shall I agree?\" \"Let me see the book,\" said Mrs. Burton, who was a comely, pleasant-looking woman of middle age. \"What\u0027s the name of it?\" [Pg 240] \"\u0027Scenes in Bible Lands,\u0027\" said Walter. He opened it, taking care to display and point out the pictures. \"I declare it is a nice book,\" said Mrs. Burton. \"Is there a picture of Jerusalem?\" \"Here it is,\" said Walter, who happened to know just where to find it. \"Isn\u0027t it a good picture? And there are plenty more as good. It\u0027s a book that ought to be in every family.\" \"Really, Mr. Burton, I don\u0027t know but we might as well take it,\" said the landlady. \"He takes it out in board, you know.\" \"Just as you say,\" said the landlord. \"I am willing.\" \"Then I\u0027ll take the book. Emma will like to look at it.\" So Walter made the first sale, on which he realized a profit of one dollar and a quarter. \"It\u0027s a pretty easy way to earn money,\" he reflected with satisfaction, \"if I can only sell copies enough. One copy sold will pay for a day\u0027s board.\" He went to bed early, and enjoyed a sound and[Pg 241] refreshing sleep. He was cheered with hopes of success on the morrow. If he could sell four copies a day, that would give him a profit of five dollars, and five dollars would leave him a handsome profit after paying expenses. The next morning after breakfast he started out, carrying with him three books. Knowing nothing of the residents of the village, he could only judge by the outward appearance of their houses. Seeing a large and handsome house standing back from the street, he decided to call. \"The people living here must be rich,\" he thought. \"They won\u0027t mind paying three dollars and a half for a nice book.\" Accordingly he walked up the gravelled path and rang the front-door bell. The door was opened by a housemaid. \"Is the lady of the house at home?\" asked Walter. \"Do you want to see her?\" \"Yes.\" \"Then wait here, and I\u0027ll tell her.\" [Pg 242] A tall woman, with a thin face and a pinched expression, presented herself after five minutes. \"Well, young man,\" she asked, after a sharp glance, \"what is your business?\" Her expression was not very encouraging, but Walter was bound not to lose an opportunity. \"I should like to show you a new book, madam,\" he commenced, \"a book of great value, beautifully illustrated, which is selling like wildfire.\" \"How many copies have you sold?\" inquired the lady, sharply. \"One,\" answered Walter, rather confused. \"Do you call that selling like wildfire?\" she demanded with sarcasm. \"I only commenced last evening,\" said Walter, \"I referred to the sales of other agents.\" \"What\u0027s the name of the book?\" \"\u0027Scenes in Bible Lands.\u0027\" \"Let me see it.\" Walter displayed the book. \"Look at the beautiful pictures,\" he said. \"I don\u0027t see anything remarkable about them.[Pg 243] The binding isn\u0027t very strong. Shouldn\u0027t wonder if the book would go to pieces in a week.\" \"I don\u0027t think there\u0027ll be any trouble that way,\" said Walter. \"If it does, you\u0027ll be gone, so it won\u0027t trouble you.\" \"With ordinary care it will hold long enough.\" \"Oh, yes, of course you\u0027d say so. I expected it. How much do you charge for the book?\" \"Three dollars and a half.\" \"Three dollars and a half!\" repeated the woman. \"You seem to think people are made of money.\" \"I don\u0027t fix the price, madam,\" said Walter, rather provoked. \"The publishers do that.\" \"I warrant they make two-thirds profit. Don\u0027t they now?\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" said Walter. \"I don\u0027t know anything about the cost of publishing books; but this is a large one, and there are a great many pictures in it. They must have cost considerable.\" \"Seems to me it\u0027s ridiculous to ask such a price for a book. Why, it\u0027s enough to buy a nice dress pattern!\" [Pg 244] \"The book will last longer than the dress,\" said Walter. \"But it is not so necessary. I\u0027ll tell you what I\u0027ll do. I\u0027d like the book well enough to put on my parlor-table. I\u0027ll give you two dollars for it.\" \"Two dollars!\" ejaculated Walter, scarcely crediting the testimony of his ears. \"Yes, two dollars; and I warrant you\u0027ll make money enough then.\" \"I should lose money,\" said Walter. \"I couldn\u0027t think of accepting such an offer.\" \"In my opinion there isn\u0027t any book worth even two dollars.\" \"I see we can\u0027t trade,\" said Walter, disgusted at such meanness in a lady who occupied so large a house, and might be supposed to have plenty of money. He began to replace the book in its brown-paper covering. \"I don\u0027t know but I might give you twenty-five cents more. Come now, I\u0027ll give you two dollars and a quarter.\" \"I can\u0027t take it,\" said Walter, shortly. \"Three[Pg 245] dollars and a half is the price, and I will not take a cent less.\" \"You won\u0027t get it out of me then,\" retorted the lady, slamming the door in displeasure. Walter had already made up his mind to this effect, and had started on his way to the gate. \"I wonder if I shall meet many people like her,\" he thought, and his courage was rather damped. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3005/82949.html","bookId":296,"book":{"id":296,"title":"Strong and Steady Or, Paddle Your Own Canoe","description":"简介： It\u0027s ever so much better than my roomtwice as big, to begin with.
