{"id":23263,"no":23,"title":"CHAPTER XXII. MESSRS. FLINT AND PUSHER.","content":"Now that he was again in his native village, Walter realized how unpleasant had been his position at Mr. Drummond\u0027s from the new elasticity and cheerfulness which he felt. There had been something gloomy and oppressive in the atmosphere of his temporary home at Stapleton, and he certainly had very little enjoyment in Joshua\u0027s society. Mrs. Drummond was the only one for whom he felt the least regard. He passed a few days quietly, renewing old acquaintances and friendships. Nancy Forbes had gone to live with a brother, who was an old bachelor, and very glad to have her with him. Her savings and the legacy left her by Mr. Conrad together amounted to a thousand dollars, or rather more,—sufficient to make Nancy rich, in her own opinion. But she was not quite satisfied about the legacy. [Pg 207] \"They say, Walter, that you\u0027ll be left poor,\" she said. \"You\u0027ll need this money.\" \"No, I shan\u0027t, Nancy,\" answered Walter. \"Besides, there\u0027s a lot of mining stock that\u0027ll come to something,—I don\u0027t know how much.\" \"But I don\u0027t feel right about taking this money, Walter.\" \"You needn\u0027t feel any scruples, Nancy. I can take care of myself. I can paddle my own canoe.\" \"But you haven\u0027t got any canoe,\" said Nancy, who did not comprehend the allusion. \"Besides, I don\u0027t see how that would help you to a living.\" Walter laughed. \"I shall get a canoe, then,\" he said, \"and I\u0027ll steer it on to Fortune.\" \"At any rate,\" said Nancy, \"I will leave you my money when I die.\" \"Who knows but you\u0027ll marry and have a lot of children?\" \"That isn\u0027t very likely, Walter, and me forty-seven a\u0027ready. I\u0027m most an old woman.\" So the conversation ended. Nancy agreed, though reluctantly, to take the legacy, resolved some time[Pg 208] or other to leave it to Walter. If she had known how little he really had left, she would not have consented to accept it at all. The same evening Walter sat in the lawyer\u0027s comfortable sitting-room, and together they discussed the future. \"So you want to be a book agent, Walter?\" said Mr. Shaw. \"I can\u0027t say I think very highly of this plan.\" \"Why not, Mr. Shaw?\" \"It will lead to nothing.\" \"I don\u0027t mean to spend my life at it. I am more ambitious than that. But it will give me a chance to travel without expense, and I always wanted to see something of the world.\" \"How old are you now?\" \"Fifteen.\" \"You are well-grown of your age. You might readily be taken for sixteen.\" \"Do you really think so?\" asked Walter, gratified, like most boys of his age, at being thought to look older than he really was. [Pg 209] \"Yes; at sixteen I was smaller than you now are.\" \"You see, Mr. Shaw, that, as I am so young, even if I spend a year at this business, I shall not be too old to undertake something else afterwards. In the mean time I shall see something of the world.\" \"Well, Walter, I won\u0027t oppose you. If I had not so much confidence in you, I should warn you of the temptations that are likely to beset your youth, left, as you will be, entirely to yourself. Of course you will be thrown among all kinds of associates.\" \"Yes, sir; but I think I shall be wise enough to avoid what will do me no good.\" \"So I hope and believe. Now, what is the name of this publisher you were speaking of?\" \"Pusher. He\u0027s of the firm of Flint \u0026 Pusher.\" \"I have heard of them. They are an enterprising firm.\" \"I think I had better start pretty soon, Mr. Shaw. I shall enjoy myself better when I am at work.\" \"Next Monday, then, if you desire it.\" It was then Friday. On Monday morning Mr. Shaw handed Walter a[Pg 210] pocket-book containing a roll of bills. \"You will need some money to defray your expenses,\" he said, \"until you are able to earn something. You will find fifty dollars in this pocket-book. There is no occasion to thank me, for I have only advanced it from money realized from your father\u0027s estate. If you need any more, you can write me, and I can send you a check or money-order.\" \"This will be quite enough, Mr. Shaw,\" said Walter, confidently. \"It won\u0027t be long before I shall be paying my way; at least I hope so. I don\u0027t mean to be idle.\" \"I am sure you won\u0027t be, or you will belie your reputation. Well, good-by, Walter. Write me soon and often. You know I look upon myself as in some sort your guardian.\" \"I will certainly write you, Mr. Shaw. By the way, I never thought to ask you about the furniture of my room at the Essex Classical Institute.\" \"It was purchased by the keeper of the boarding-house; at a sacrifice, it is true, but I thought it best to let it go, to save trouble.\" Illustration \"I should like to see Lem,\" thought Walter, with[Pg 211] a little sigh as he called to mind the pleasant hours he had passed with his school-fellow. \"I\u0027ll go back and pay the old institute a visit some time, after I\u0027ve got back from my travels.\" Walter reached New York by ten o\u0027clock. Though his acquaintance with the city streets was very limited, as he had seldom visited it, he found his way without much trouble to the place of business of Messrs. Flint \u0026 Pusher. As they did not undertake to do a retail business, but worked entirely through agents, their rooms were not on the first floor, but on the third. Opening the door of the room, to which he was guided by a directory in the entry beneath, Walter found himself in a large apartment, the floor of which was heaped up with piles of books, chiefly octavos. An elderly gentleman, with a partially bald head, and wearing spectacles, was talking with two men, probably agents. \"Well, young man,\" said he, in rather a sharp voice, \"what can I do for you?\" \"Is Mr. Pusher in?\" asked Walter. \"He went out for a few minutes; will be back directly. Did you wish particularly to see him?\" [Pg 212] \"Yes, sir.\" \"Take a seat, then, and wait till he comes in.\" Walter sat down and listened to the conversation. \"You met with fair success, then?\" inquired Mr. Flint. \"Yes, the book takes well. I sold ten in one day, and six and eight in other days.\" Walter pricked up his ears. He wondered whether the book was the one recommended to him. If so, a sale of ten copies would enable the agent to realize twelve dollars and a half, which was certainly doing very well. Just as the agents were going out, Mr. Pusher bustled in. His sharp eyes fell upon Walter, whom he immediately recognized. \"Ha, my young friend, so you have found us out,\" he said, offering his hand. \"Yes, sir.\" \"Come to talk on business, I hope?\" \"Yes, sir, that is my object in coming.\" \"Mr. Flint,\" said Mr. Pusher, \"this is a young friend whose acquaintance I made a short time[Pg 213] since. I told him, if ever he wanted employment, to come here, and we would give him something to do.\" Mr. Flint, who was a slower and a more cautious man than Mr. Pusher, regarded Walter a little doubtfully. \"Do you mean as an agent?\" he said. \"Certainly I do.\" \"He seems very young.\" \"That\u0027s true, but age isn\u0027t always an advantage. He looks smart, and I\u0027ll guarantee that he is all he looks. I claim to be something of a judge of human nature too.\" \"No doubt you\u0027re right,\" said Mr. Flint, who was accustomed to defer considerably to his more impetuous partner. \"What\u0027s the young man\u0027s name?\" \"You\u0027ve got me there,\" said Mr. Pusher, laughing. \"If I ever knew, which is doubtful, I\u0027ve forgotten.\" \"My name is Walter Conrad,\" said our hero. \"Very good. Well, Conrad,\" continued Mr. Pusher, in an off-hand manner, \"what are your[Pg 214] wishes? What book do you want to take hold of?\" \"You mentioned a book the other day,—\u0027Scenes in Bible Lands.\u0027\" \"Yes, our new book. That would be as good as any to begin on. How\u0027s the territory, Mr. Flint?\" Mr. Flint referred to a book. \"Most of the territory near by is taken up,\" he said. \"Does Mr. Conrad wish to operate near home?\" \"I would rather go to a distance,\" said Walter. \"As far as Ohio?\" \"Yes.\" \"In that case you could map out your own route pretty much. We haven\u0027t got the West portioned out as we have the Middle and New England States.\" \"In other words, we can give you a kind of roving commission, Conrad,\" put in Mr. Pusher. \"That would suit me, sir,\" said Walter. \"Still it would be best not to attempt to cover too much territory. A rolling stone gathers no moss, you know. There is one important question[Pg 215] I must ask you to begin with. Have you got any money?\" \"Yes, sir, I have fifty dollars.\" \"Good. Of course you will need money to get out to your field of labor, and will have to pay your expenses till you begin to earn something. Fifty dollars will answer very well.\" \"As I don\u0027t know very well how the business is managed,\" said Walter, \"I must ask for instructions.\" \"Of course. You\u0027re a green hand. Sit down here, and I\u0027ll make it all plain to you.\" So Mr. Pusher, in his brief, incisive way, explained to Walter how he must manage. His instructions were readily comprehended, and Walter, as he listened, felt eager to enter upon the adventurous career which he had chosen. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3005/82946.html","bookId":296,"book":{"id":296,"title":"Strong and Steady Or, Paddle Your Own Canoe","description":"简介： It\u0027s ever so much better than my roomtwice as big, to begin with.
