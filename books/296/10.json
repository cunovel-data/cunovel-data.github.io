{"id":23250,"no":10,"title":"CHAPTER IX. HOW MR. DRUMMOND TOOK THE NEWS.","content":"Joshua\u0027s anticipations of a good breakfast were realized. As he entered the room where the table was set, he saw a dish of beefsteak, another of fried potatoes, and some hot biscuit. This with coffee was very much better than the breakfast usually provided in the Drummond household. Joshua burst into a fresh fit of laughter, thinking how his father had been taken in. \"What\u0027s the matter, Joshua?\" asked his mother, who was the only one in the room besides himself. \"Oh, it\u0027s the richest joke, mother!\" \"What is?\" asked Mrs. Drummond, perplexed. \"I can\u0027t tell you now, but you\u0027ll find out pretty soon. Ho, ho!\" And Joshua commenced to laugh again. \"Has Mr. Conrad come downstairs?\" \"I haven\u0027t seen Mr. Conrad this morning,\" [Pg 79]answered Joshua, imitating his mother\u0027s tone in repeating the name. Just then Walter entered, and said \"Good-morning.\" \"Good-morning, Mr. Conrad,\" said Mrs. Drummond. \"I hope you slept well.\" \"Very well, thank you,\" said Walter. Mr. Drummond here entered from the street, having been for an hour in the store opposite. \"Good-morning, Mr. Conrad,\" he said. \"I trust you rested well, and can do justice to our humble repast. I have been in the store an hour. We who are not endowed with the gifts of Fortune must be early astir.\" Joshua tried to suppress a laugh, but not with entire success. \"What are you snickering at, Joshua?\" demanded Mr. Drummond, in a displeased tone. \"I don\u0027t know what Mr. Conrad will think of your manners.\" \"You\u0027ll excuse them, won\u0027t you, Mr. Conrad?\" asked Joshua, beginning to chuckle again. Knowing very well the source of his amusement, and feeling his own position to be an awkward one,[Pg 80] Walter was all the more resolved to impart to Mr. Drummond without delay the posture of his father\u0027s affairs. He did not answer Joshua\u0027s appeal. \"I don\u0027t see what has got into you this morning, Joshua,\" said Mrs. Drummond, mildly. \"You seem in very good spirits.\" \"So I am,\" said Joshua, with a grin. His father suspected that the unusual excellence of the breakfast had something to do with Joshua\u0027s mirth, and was afraid he would let out something about it. This made him a little nervous, as he wanted to keep up appearances before his young guest. Walter\u0027s appetite was not very good. His father\u0027s death weighed heavily upon him, and Joshua\u0027s revelation of the night before was not calculated to cheer him. It was mortifying to think that Mr. Drummond\u0027s gracious manner was entirely owing to his supposed wealth; but of this he entertained little doubt. He was anxious to have the truth known, no matter how unfavorably it might affect his position with the Drummonds. There were some, he knew, whose kindness did not depend on his reputed[Pg 81] wealth. \"You have a poor appetite, Mr. Conrad,\" said Mr. Drummond. \"Let me give you another piece of steak.\" \"No, I thank you,\" said Walter. \"I\u0027ll take another piece, father,\" said Joshua. \"I have already helped you twice,\" said his father, frowning. \"I\u0027m hungry this morning,\" said Joshua, who, knowing that he could not expect another as good breakfast, determined to do full justice to this. \"If you are, you need not overeat yourself,\" said Mr. Drummond, depositing on his son\u0027s outstretched plate a square inch of meat. Joshua coolly helped himself to fried potatoes, and appropriated a hot biscuit, much to his father\u0027s annoyance. He resolved to give Joshua a private hint that he must be more sparing in his eating. He did not like to speak before Walter, desiring to keep up with him the character of a liberal man. Joshua understood his father\u0027s feelings, and it contributed to the enjoyment which he felt at the thought of how richly his father was sold. At length breakfast was over. [Pg 82] \"I must go back to the store,\" said Mr. Drummond. \"Joshua will look after you, Mr. Conrad. I hope you will be able to pass the time pleasantly.\" \"If you can spare me five minutes, Mr. Drummond, I should like to speak to you in private,\" said Walter, determined to put an end to the misunderstanding at once. \"Certainly. I can spare five or ten minutes, or more, Mr. Conrad. Won\u0027t you walk into the parlor?\" The parlor was a very dreary-looking room, dark, cold, and cheerless. A carpet, of an ugly pattern, covered the floor; there was a centre-table in the middle of the room with a few books that were never opened resting upon it. Half-a-dozen cane-bottomed chairs stood about the room, and there were besides a few of the stock articles usually to be found in country parlors, including a very hard, inhospitable-looking sofa. As the Drummonds did not have much company, this room was very seldom used. \"Take a seat, Mr. Conrad,\" said Mr. Drummond, seating himself. [Pg 83] Mr. Drummond was far from anticipating the nature of Walter\u0027s communication. Indeed, he cherished a hope that our hero was about to ask his assistance in settling up the estate,—a request with which, it is needless to say, he would gladly have complied. \"I don\u0027t suppose you know how I am situated,\" Walter commenced. \"I mean in relation to my father\u0027s estate.\" \"I suppose it was all left to you, and very properly. I congratulate you on starting in the world under such good auspices. I don\u0027t, of course, know how much your father left, but—\" \"It is not certain that my father left anything,\" said Walter, thinking it best to reveal every thing at once. \"What!\" exclaimed Mr. Drummond, his lower jaw falling, and looking very blank. \"My father made some investments recently that turned out badly.\" \"But he was worth a very large property,—it can\u0027t all be lost.\" \"I am afraid there will be very little left, if [Pg 84]anything. He lost heavily by some mining stock, which he bought at a high figure, and which ran down to almost nothing.\" \"There\u0027s the house left, at any rate.\" \"My father borrowed its value, I understand; I am afraid that must go too.\" Now, at length, it flashed upon Mr. Drummond how he had been taken in. He thought of the attentions he had lavished upon Walter, of the extra expense he had incurred, and all as it appeared for a boy likely to prove penniless. He might even expect to live upon him. These thoughts, which rapidly succeeded each other, mortified and made him angry. \"Why didn\u0027t you tell me this before, young man?\" he demanded with asperity. His change of tone and manner showed Walter that Joshua was entirely right in his estimate of his father\u0027s motives, and he in turn became indignant. \"When did you expect me to tell you, Mr. Drummond?\" he said quickly. \"I only arrived yesterday afternoon, and I tell you this morning. I would have told you last night, if you had been in the house.\" [Pg 85] \"Why didn\u0027t you tell me when I was at Willoughby?\" \"I had other things to think of,\" said Walter, shortly. \"The thought of my father\u0027s death and of my loss shut out everything else.\" \"Well, what are you going to do?\" asked Mr. Drummond, in a hard tone. \"I shall have to earn my own living,\" said Walter. \"I am well and strong, and am not afraid.\" \"That is a good plan,\" said Mr. Drummond, who knew Walter so little as to fear that he wanted to become dependent upon him. \"When I was of your age I had my own living to earn. What do you propose to do?\" \"Have you a vacancy for me in your store? Joshua told me you wished him to go in.\" \"You couldn\u0027t earn much, for you don\u0027t know anything of the business.\" \"I should not expect to. I am perfectly willing to work for my board until I find out how my father\u0027s affairs are going to turn out.\" This proposal struck Mr. Drummond favorably. He judged that Walter would prove a valuable[Pg 86] assistant when he was broken in, for it was easy to see that he had energy. Besides, it was desirable to keep him near until it was decided whether Mr. Conrad\u0027s affairs were really in as bad a state as his son represented. Even if a few thousand dollars were left, Mr. Drummond would like the handling of that sum. Then, again, no one knew better than Mr. Drummond that Walter\u0027s board would cost him very little; for, of course, he would at once return to his usual frugal fare. \"Very well,\" he said; \"you can go into the store on those terms. As you say, you\u0027ve got your own living to earn, and the sooner you begin the better.\" Walter had not said this, but he agreed with Mr. Drummond. It may be thought strange that our hero should have been willing to enter the employment of such a mean man; but he thought it wisest to remain in the neighborhood until he could learn something definite about his father\u0027s affairs. He prepared to go to work at once, partly because he didn\u0027t wish to be dependent, partly because he foresaw that he should be happier if employed. When Mr. Drummond and Walter came out of the parlor, Joshua was waiting in the next room, and looked up eagerly to see how his father bore the communication. He was disappointed when he saw that Mr. Drummond looked much as usual. \"Conrad has been telling me,\" said Mr. Drummond, \"that his father lost a good deal of money by speculation, and it is doubtful whether he has left any property.\" \"I am very sorry,\" said Mrs. Drummond; and Walter saw and appreciated her look of sympathy. \"As he will probably have to work for a living, he has asked for a place in my store,\" pursued Mr. Drummond, \"and I have agreed to take him on trial. Conrad, you may get your hat and come over at once.\" Joshua whistled in sheer amazement. The affair had by no means terminated as he anticipated.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3005/82933.html","bookId":296,"book":{"id":296,"title":"Strong and Steady Or, Paddle Your Own Canoe","description":"简介： It\u0027s ever so much better than my roomtwice as big, to begin with.
