{"id":23249,"no":9,"title":"CHAPTER VIII. WALTER MAKES A REVELATION.","content":"Walter did not anticipate a very pleasant walk with Joshua. The little he had seen of that young man did not prepossess him in his favor. However, having no other way of spending his time, he had no objection to the walk. \"That\u0027s the old man\u0027s store just across the street,\" said Joshua, as they emerged from the house. \"Your father\u0027s?\" \"Of course. Don\u0027t you see the name on the sign?\" Walter did see it, but never having been accustomed to speak of his own father as \"the old man,\" he was not quite sure he apprehended Joshua\u0027s meaning. \"You were an only child, weren\u0027t you?\" said Joshua. \"Yes,\" said Walter, soberly. Illustration He could not help thinking what a comfort it would[Pg 69] have been to him to have either brother or sister. He would have felt less alone in the world. \"So am I,\" said Joshua; adding, complacently, \"Between you and I, the old man has laid up quite a snug sum. Of course it\u0027ll all come to me some day.\" \"I am glad to hear it,\" said Walter, rather wondering that Joshua should have made such a communication to a comparative stranger. \"To hear the old man talk,\" pursued Joshua, \"you\u0027d think he was awful poor. He\u0027s stingy enough about everything in the house. There isn\u0027t a family in town that don\u0027t live better than we do.\" \"I thought we had a very good supper,\" said Walter, who experienced not a little disgust at Joshua\u0027s charges against his father. \"That was because you were with us. The old man laid himself out for the occasion.\" \"I am sorry if any difference was made on my account.\" \"Well, I aint. It\u0027s the first decent supper I\u0027ve eaten at home since the Sewing Circle met at our house three years ago.\" [Pg 70] \"Is that the church?\" asked Walter, desirous of diverting the conversation into another channel. \"Yes, that\u0027s the old meeting-house. I hate to go there. The minister\u0027s an old fogy.\" \"What is that I see through the trees? Is it a river?\" \"No, it\u0027s a pond.\" \"Do you ever go out on it?\" \"Not very often. I tried to get the old man to buy me a boat, but he wouldn\u0027t do it. He\u0027s too stingy.\" \"I wouldn\u0027t talk so about your father.\" \"Why not?\" \"Because he is entitled to your respect.\" \"I don\u0027t know about that. If he\u0027d treat me as he ought to, I\u0027d treat him accordingly. He never gives me a cent if he can help it. Now how much do you think he allows me a week for spending money?\" \"I can\u0027t tell.\" \"Only fifty cents, and I\u0027m eighteen years old. Isn\u0027t that mean?\" \"It isn\u0027t a very large sum.\" \"Of course not. He ought to give me five dollars[Pg 71] a week, and then I\u0027d buy my own clothes. Now I have to take up with what I can get. He wanted to have his old overcoat, that he\u0027d worn three winters, made over for me; but I wouldn\u0027t stand it. I told him I\u0027d go without first.\" Though these communications did not raise Joshua in the estimation of Walter, the latter could not help thinking that there was probably some foundation for what was said, and the prejudice against Mr. Drummond, for which he had blamed himself as without cause, began to find some extenuation. \"When I talk to the old man about his stinting me so,\" continued Joshua, \"he tells me to go to work and earn some money.\" \"Why don\u0027t you do it?\" \"He wants me to go into his store, but he wouldn\u0027t pay me anything. He offered me a dollar and a half a week; but I wasn\u0027t going to work ten or twelve hours a day for no such sum. If I could get a light, easy place in the city, say at ten dollars a week, I\u0027d go. There aint any chance in Stapleton for a young man of enterprise.\" \"I\u0027ve thought sometimes,\" said Walter, \"that I[Pg 72] should like to get a place in the city; but I suppose I couldn\u0027t get enough at first to pay my board.\" \"You get a place!\" exclaimed Joshua, in astonishment. \"I thought you was going to college.\" \"Father intended I should; but his death will probably change my plans.\" \"I don\u0027t see why.\" \"It is expensive passing through college; I cannot afford it.\" \"Oh, that\u0027s all humbug. You\u0027re talking like the old man.\" \"How do you know that it is humbug?\" demanded Walter, not very well pleased with his companion\u0027s tone. \"Why, you\u0027re rich. The old man told me that your father left a hundred thousand dollars. You\u0027re the only son; you told me so yourself.\" \"Your father is mistaken.\" \"What, wasn\u0027t your father rich?\" asked Joshua, opening his small eyes in amazement. \"My father was unfortunate enough to get involved in a speculation, by which he lost heavily. I can\u0027t[Pg 73] tell how his affairs stand till they are settled. I may be left penniless.\" \"Do you mean that?\" asked Joshua, stopping short and facing his companion. \"I generally mean what I say,\" said Walter, rather stiffly. Joshua\u0027s answer was a low whistle of amazement. \"Whew!\" he said. \"That\u0027s the biggest joke I\u0027ve heard of lately;\" and he followed up this remark by a burst of merriment. Walter surveyed him with surprise. He certainly did not know what to make of Joshua\u0027s conduct. \"I don\u0027t see any joke about it,\" he said. \"I don\u0027t complain of being poor, for I think I can earn my own living; but it doesn\u0027t strike me as a thing to laugh at.\" \"I was laughing to think how the old man is taken in. It\u0027s rich!\" Joshua burst into another fit of boisterous laughter. \"How is he taken in?\" \"He thinks you\u0027re worth a hundred thousand[Pg 74] dollars,\" said Joshua, going off in another peal of merriment. \"Well, he is mistaken, that\u0027s all. I don\u0027t see how he is taken in.\" \"He\u0027s been doing the polite, and treating you as if you was a prince of the blood. That\u0027s the reason he told the old woman to get up such a nice supper, he expected to get you to take him for a guardian, and then he\u0027d have the handling of your money. Won\u0027t he be mad when he finds out how he\u0027s been taken in? Giving you the best room too! Are you sure that none of the property will be left?\" \"Probably not much.\" That Walter listened with mortification and disgust to what Joshua had told him about his father\u0027s selfish designs, is only what might be expected. It is always disagreeable to find out the meanness of those whom you have supposed kind to you for your own sake. This, to Walter, who had been accustomed to an atmosphere of kindness, was a painful discovery. It was his first experience of the coldness and hollowness of the world, and to the sensitive[Pg 75] nature of youth this first revelation is very painful and very bitter. \"I am sorry to think that your father made such a mistake,\" he said, coldly. \"I will take care to undeceive him.\" \"What! You\u0027re not going to tell him, are you?\" \"Certainly. I meant to do so; but I did not suppose he invited me just because he thought I was rich.\" \"What for, then?\" \"Being my father\u0027s cousin and nearest relation, it didn\u0027t seem very strange that he should have invited me on that account.\" \"The old man\u0027s a shrewd one,\" said Joshua, rather admiringly. \"He knows which way his bread is buttered. He don\u0027t lay himself out for no poor relations, not if he knows it.\" \"I am sorry if he has laid himself out for me under a mistake.\" \"I aint. It\u0027s a good joke on the old man. Besides, we all got a better supper by it. Don\u0027t you tell him about it till to-morrow.\" \"Why not?\" [Pg 76] \"Because, if you do, we\u0027ll have a mean breakfast as usual. I just want him to think you\u0027re rich a little while longer, so we can have something decent for once.\" \"I don\u0027t feel willing to deceive your father any longer. I have not willingly deceived him at all.\" \"You\u0027re a fool then!\" \"Look here,\" said Walter, flushing a little, \"I don\u0027t allow anybody to call me by that name.\" \"No offence,\" said Joshua, whose physical courage was not very great. \"I didn\u0027t mean anything, of course, except that it was foolish to blurt it all out to-night, when there isn\u0027t any need of it. There isn\u0027t such an awful hurry, is there?\" \"I would rather your father knew at once.\" \"To-morrow will be soon enough.\" \"At any rate I shall tell him to-morrow, then. But I\u0027ve got tired walking. Suppose we go back.\" \"Just as you say.\" They went back together. Mr. Drummond was in the store, but Mrs. Drummond was at home. \"You didn\u0027t go far,\" she said. \"But I suppose you were tired, Mr. Conrad.\" \"A little,\" answered Walter. \"I wonder,\" thought our hero, \"whether she will change as soon as she finds out that I am poor?\" Somehow he felt that she would not. She seemed very different from her husband and son, and Walter was inclined to like her better. Joshua went out again soon, not having much taste for staying at home; and, as Walter retired early, he did not see either him or his father again till the next morning at breakfast.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3005/82932.html","bookId":296,"book":{"id":296,"title":"Strong and Steady Or, Paddle Your Own Canoe","description":"简介： It\u0027s ever so much better than my roomtwice as big, to begin with.
