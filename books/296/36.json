{"id":23276,"no":36,"title":"CHAPTER XXXV. THE LAST OF JACK MANGUM.","content":"\"What\u0027s the matter?\" asked one of the two men as Walter came up. \"I got lost in the woods, and passed the night in that man\u0027s house,\" said our hero. \"He tried to rob me, but I locked him in the closet, and jumped out of the window and escaped. This morning he got on my track, and would have caught me but for the ditch.\" \"You locked him in the closet!\" repeated the other. \"How were you able to do that? You are only a boy, while he is a strong man.\" Walter explained the matter briefly. \"That was pretty smart,\" said Peter Halcomb, for this was the name of the man who questioned him. \"You\u0027re able to take care of yourself.\" \"I don\u0027t know how it would turn out, if you hadn\u0027t come up.\" [Pg 336] \"I happened to be at home when my boy came and told me that Jack Mangum had offered him fifty cents for some breakfast. He told me about you also, and, as I suspected Jack was up to some of his tricks, I came along.\" \"I am very much obliged to you,\" said Walter, \"and I hope you\u0027ll let me pay you for your trouble.\" \"I don\u0027t want any pay, but you may pay my boy what you promised him, if you want to.\" \"I certainly will; and I never paid away money with more pleasure. As I haven\u0027t had anything to eat since yesterday afternoon, I should like to have you direct me to the nearest place where I can get some breakfast.\" \"Come to my house; I guess my wife can scare up some breakfast for you. She\u0027ll be glad to see the boy that got the better of Jack Mangum.\" \"How long has this Jack Mangum lived about here?\" asked Walter, after accepting with thanks the offer of a breakfast. \"About five years. He\u0027s been in the county jail twice during that time, and there\u0027s a warrant out for[Pg 337] him now. He\u0027s a confirmed thief. He\u0027d rather steal any time than earn an honest living.\" \"Has he ever stolen anything from you?\" \"I\u0027ve missed some of my chickens from time to time, and, though I didn\u0027t catch him taking them, I\u0027ve no doubt he was the thief. Once I lost a lamb, and I suppose it went in the same direction.\" \"So there is a warrant out for him now?\" \"Yes, and I expect he\u0027ll be taken in a day or two. In that case he\u0027ll have the privilege of a few months\u0027 free board in the county jail.\" \"Where is the jail?\" \"In T——.\" \"That\u0027s the town I\u0027m going to.\" \"Is it? Do your folks live there?\" \"No, I\u0027m travelling on business.\" \"What\u0027s your business?\" asked the farmer. The question was an abrupt one, but was not meant to be rude. In country towns everybody feels that he has a right to become acquainted with the business of any one with whom he comes in contact, even in its minutest details. Walter [Pg 338]understood this, having himself lived in a country village, and answered without taking offence:— \"I am a book-agent.\" \"Be you? How do you make it pay?\" \"Pretty well, but I can tell better by and by; I\u0027ve only been in it a week.\" \"You\u0027re pretty young to be a book-peddler Where do your folks live?\" \"In New York.\" \"You\u0027ve come some ways from home.\" \"Yes; I thought I should like to see the country.\" \"How old are you?\" \"Fifteen.\" \"You\u0027ll make a smart man if you keep on.\" \"I hope I shall,\" said Walter, modestly; \"but I am afraid you overrate me.\" \"I\u0027ll tell you what I judge from. A boy of fifteen that can get the better of Jack Mangum is smart, and no mistake.\" \"I hope I shall realize your prediction,\" returned Walter, who naturally felt pleased with the compliment. Like most boys, he liked to be considered smart, although he did not allow himself to be puffed[Pg 339] up by inordinate ideas of his own importance, as is the case with many of his age. While this conversation was going on, they had been walking towards the farm-house in which Peter Holcomb lived. It was an humble one-story building, with an attic above. On each side of it were broad fields, some under cultivation; and there was an appearance of thrift and comfort despite the smallness of the house. \"Come in,\" said Peter, leading the way. \"John,\" he added, addressing the hired man, who had accompanied him, \"you may go into the potato field and hoe. I\u0027ll be out directly.\" Walter followed him into a broad, low room,—the kitchen,—in which Mrs. Holcomb, a pleasant looking woman, was engaged in cooking. \"Mary,\" said her husband, \"can\u0027t you scare up some breakfast for this young man? He stopped at Jack Mangum\u0027s last night, and didn\u0027t like his accommodations well enough to stay to breakfast.\" \"You don\u0027t say so,\" repeated Mrs. Holcomb her countenance expressing curiosity. \"That\u0027s about the last place I\u0027d want to stop at.\" [Pg 340] \"I shouldn\u0027t want to go there again,\" said Walter; \"but I didn\u0027t know anything about the man, or I would rather have stayed out in the woods.\" \"Well, Mary, how about the breakfast?\" \"I guess I can find some,\" said she. \"Sit right down here, and I\u0027ll see what I can do for you.\" She went to the pantry, and speedily reappeared with some cold meat, a loaf of bread, and some fresh butter, which she placed on the table. \"I\u0027ve got some hot water,\" she said, \"and, in about five minutes, I can give you some warm tea. It won\u0027t be much of a breakfast, but if you\u0027ll stop for dinner, I can give you something better.\" \"It looks nice,\" said Walter, \"and I don\u0027t know when I have been so hungry.\" At this moment the farmer\u0027s boy, who had served as Walter\u0027s messenger, came into the kitchen. \"You got away,\" he said, smiling. \"Yes, thanks to you,\" said Walter. \"Here is what I promised you.\" \"I don\u0027t know as I ought to take it,\" said the boy, hesitating, though he evidently wanted it. \"You will do me a favor by accepting it,\" said[Pg 341] Walter. \"You got me out of a bad scrape. Besides, you had a chance to earn some money from Jack Mangum.\" \"I wouldn\u0027t have done anything for him, at any rate. He\u0027s a thief.\" Finally Peter, for he was named after his father, accepted the dollar, and, sitting down by Walter, asked him about his adventure in the wood, listening with great interest to the details. \"I wouldn\u0027t have dared to do as you did,\" he said. \"Perhaps you would if you had been obliged to.\" By this time the tea was steeped, and Walter\u0027s breakfast was before him. He made so vigorous an onslaught upon the bread and meat that he was almost ashamed of his appetite; but Mrs. Holcomb evidently felt flattered at the compliment paid to her cookery, and watched the demolition of the provisions with satisfaction. \"You had better stop to dinner,\" she said. \"We shall have some roast meat and apple-pudding.\" \"Thank you,\" said Walter; \"but I have eaten enough to last me for several hours. Can you tell me how far it is to the next town?\" [Pg 342] \"About five miles. I\u0027m going to ride over there in about an hour. If you\u0027ll wait till then I\u0027ll take you over.\" Walter very readily consented to wait. He was rather afraid that if he ventured to walk he might find Jack Mangum waiting to waylay him somewhere in the road, and he had no desire for a second encounter with him. The farmer absolutely refused to accept pay for breakfast, though Walter urged it. It was contrary to his ideas of hospitality. \"We don\u0027t keep a tavern,\" he said; \"and we never shall miss the little you ate. Come again and see us if you come back this way.\" \"Thank you,\" said Walter, \"I will accept your invitation with pleasure, but I shall not feel like calling on Mr. Mangum.\" \"I\u0027ve no doubt he would be glad to see you,\" said Peter Holcomb, smiling. \"Yes, he was very sorry to have me leave him last night.\" Walter thought he had seen the last of Jack [Pg 343]Mangum; but he was mistaken. Three days later, while walking in the main street of T——, with a book under his arm, for he had received a fresh supply from the agent at Cleveland, he heard the sound of wheels. Looking up, he saw a wagon approaching, containing two men. One of them, as he afterwards learned, was the sheriff. The other he immediately recognized as Jack Mangum. There was no mistaking his sinister face and forbidding scowl. He had been taken early that morning by the sheriff, who, with a couple of men to assist him, had visited the cabin in the forest, and, despite the resistance offered by Jack, who was aided by his wife, he had been bound, and was now being conveyed to jail. He also looked up and recognized Walter. His face became even more sinister, as he shook his fist at our hero. \"I\u0027ll be even with you some day, you young cub!\" he exclaimed. \"Not if I can help it,\" thought Walter; but he did not answer in words. He was rather gratified to hear the next day that[Pg 344] Jack had been sentenced to six months\u0027 imprisonment. He felt some pity, however, for Meg, who might have been a good woman if she had been married to a different man. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3005/82959.html","bookId":296,"book":{"id":296,"title":"Strong and Steady Or, Paddle Your Own Canoe","description":"简介： It\u0027s ever so much better than my roomtwice as big, to begin with.
