{"id":23268,"no":28,"title":"CHAPTER XXVII. A CABIN IN THE WOODS.","content":"Walter found a good dinner ready for him at twelve o\u0027clock, which he enjoyed the more because he felt that he had earned it in advance. He waited till about two o\u0027clock, and again set out, this time in a different direction. As it takes all sorts of people to make a world, so the reception he met with at different places differed. In some he was received politely; in others he was treated as a humbug. But Walter was by this time getting accustomed to his position, and found that he must meet disagreeable people with as good humor as he could command. One farmer was willing to take the book if he would accept pay in apples, of which he offered him two barrels; but this offer he did not for a moment entertain, judging that he would find it difficult to carry about the apples, and probably difficult to dispose of them. However, he managed to sell two[Pg 257] copies, though he had to call at twenty places to do it. Nevertheless, he felt well repaid by the degree of success he met with. \"Five books sold to-day!\" thought Walter, complacently, as he started on his walk home. \"That gives me six dollars and a quarter profit. I wish I could keep that up.\" But our young merchant found that he was not likely to keep up such sales. The next day he sold but two copies, and the day succeeding three. Still for three days and a half the aggregate sale was eleven copies, making a clear profit of thirteen dollars and seventy-five cents. At the end of the week he had sold twenty copies; but to make up this number he had been obliged to visit one or two neighboring villages. He now prepared to move on. The next place at which he proposed to stop for a few days we will call Bolton. He had already written to Cleveland for a fresh supply of books to be forwarded to him there. He had but two books left, and his baggage being contained in a small valise, he decided to walk this distance, partly out of economy, but principally[Pg 258] because it would enable him to see the country at his leisure. During the first five miles he succeeded in selling both books, which relieved him of the burden of carrying them, leaving him only his valise. Walter was strong and stout, and enjoyed his walk. There was a freshness and novelty about his present mode of life, which he liked. He did not imagine he should like to be a book-agent all his life, but for a time he found it quite agreeable. He stopped under the shade of a large elm and ate the lunch which he had brought with him from the inn. The sandwiches and apples were good, and, with the addition of some water from a stream near by, made a very acceptable lunch. When he resumed his walk after resting a couple of hours, the weather had changed. In the morning it was bright sunshine. Now the clouds had gathered, and a storm seemed imminent. To make matters worse, Walter had managed to stray from the road. He found himself walking in a narrow lane, lined on either side by thick woods. Soon the rain come pattering down, at first in small drops, but quickly poured down in a drenching shower. Walter took[Pg 259] refuge in the woods, congratulating himself that he had sold the books, which otherwise would have run the risk of being spoiled. \"I wish there were some house near by in which I could rest,\" thought Walter. The prospect of being benighted in the woods in such weather was far from pleasant. Looking around anxiously, he espied a small foot-path, which he followed, hoping, but hardly expecting, that it might lead to some place of refuge. To his agreeable surprise he emerged after a few minutes into a small clearing, perhaps half an acre in extent, in the middle of which was a rough cabin. It was a strange place for a house, but, rude as it was, Walter hailed its appearance with joy. At all events it promised protection from the weather, and the people who occupied it would doubtless be willing to give him, for pay of course, supper and lodging. Probably the accommodations would not be first class, but our hero was prepared to take what he could get, and be thankful for it. Accordingly he advanced fearlessly and pounded on the door with his fist, as there was neither bell nor knocker. [Pg 260] The door not being opened immediately, he pounded again. This time a not particularly musical voice was heard from within:— \"Is that you, Jack?\" \"No,\" answered Walter, \"it isn\u0027t Jack.\" His voice was probably recognized as that of a boy, and any apprehension that might have been felt by the person within was dissipated. Walter heard a bolt withdrawn, and the door opening revealed a tall, gaunt, bony woman, who eyed him in a manner which could not be considered very friendly or cordial. \"Who are you?\" she demanded abruptly, keeping the door partly closed. \"I am a book-agent,\" said Walter. \"Do you expect to sell any books here?\" asked the woman, with grim humor. \"No,\" said Walter, \"but I have been caught in the storm, and lost my way. Can I stop here over night if the storm should hold on?\" \"This isn\u0027t a tavern,\" said the woman, ungraciously. \"No, I suppose not,\" said Walter; \"but it will be[Pg 261] a favor to me if you will take me in, and I will pay you whatever you think right. I suppose there is no tavern near by.\" He half hoped there might be, for he had already made up his mind that this would not be a very agreeable place to stop at. \"There\u0027s one five miles off,\" said the woman. \"That\u0027s too far to go in such weather. If you\u0027ll let me stay here, I will pay you whatever you ask in advance.\" \"Humph!\" said the woman, doubtfully, \"I don\u0027t know how Jack will like it.\" As Walter could know nothing of the sentiments of the Jack referred to, he remained silent, and waited for the woman to make up her mind, believing that she would decide in his favor. He proved to be right. \"Well,\" she said, half unwillingly, \"I don\u0027t know but I\u0027ll take you in, though it isn\u0027t my custom to accommodate travellers.\" \"I will try not to give you much trouble,\" said Walter, relieved to find that he was sure of food and shelter. [Pg 262] \"Humph!\" responded the woman. She led the way into the building, which appeared to contain two rooms on the first floor, and probably the same number of chambers above. There was no entry, but the door opened at once into the kitchen. \"Come up to the fire if you\u0027re wet,\" said the woman. The invitation was hospitable, but the manner was not. However, Walter was glad to accept the invitation, without thinking too much of the manner in which it was expressed, for his clothes were pretty well saturated by the rain. There was no stove, but an old brick fireplace, on which two stout logs were burning. There was one convenience at least about living in the woods. Fuel was abundant, and required nothing but the labor of cutting it. \"I think I\u0027ll take off my shoes,\" said Walter. \"You can if you want to,\" said his grim hostess. He extended his wet feet towards the fire, and felt a sense of comfort stealing over him. He could hear the rain falling fiercely against the sides of the cabin, and felt glad that he was not compelled to stand the brunt of the storm. Illustration [Pg 263] He looked around him guardedly, not wishing to let his hostess see that he was doing so, for she looked like one who might easily be offended. The room seemed remarkably bare of furniture. There was an unpainted table, and there were also three chairs, one of which had lost its back. These were plain wooden chairs, and though they appeared once to have been painted, few vestiges of the original paint now remained. On a shelf were a few articles of tin, but no articles of crockery were visible, except two cracked cups. Walter had before this visited the dwellings of the poor, but he had never seen a home so poorly provided with what are generally regarded as the necessaries of life. \"I wonder what Lem would say if he should see me now,\" thought Walter, his thoughts going back to the Essex Classical Institute, and the friend whose studies he shared. They seemed far away, those days of careless happiness, when as yet the burdens of life were unfelt and scarcely even dreamed of. Did Walter sigh for their return? I think not, except on one account. His father was then alive, and he would have given years of his own life to[Pg 264] recall that loved parent from the grave. But I do not think he would have cared, for the present at least, to give up his business career, humble though it was, and go back to his studies. He enjoyed the novelty of his position. He enjoyed even his present adventure, in spite of the discomforts that attended it, and there was something exciting in looking about him, and realizing that he was a guest in a rough cabin in the midst of the woods, a thousand miles away from home. Guarded as he had been in looking around him, it did not escape without observation. \"Well, young man, this is a poor place, isn\u0027t it?\" asked the woman, suddenly. \"I don\u0027t know,\" said Walter, wishing to be polite. \"That\u0027s what you\u0027re thinkin\u0027, I\u0027ll warrant,\" said the woman. \"Well, you\u0027re not obliged to stay, if you don\u0027t want to.\" \"But I do want to, and I am very much obliged to you for consenting to take me,\" said Walter, hastily. \"You said you would pay in advance,\" said the woman. \"So I will,\" said Walter, taking out his pocket-book, \"if you will tell me how much I am to pay.\" \"You may give me a dollar,\" said the woman. Walter drew out a roll of bills, and, finding a one-dollar note, handed it to the woman. She took it, glancing covetously at the remaining money which he replaced in his pocket-book. Walter noticed the glance, and, though he was not inclined to be suspicious, it gave him a vague feeling of anxiety. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3005/82951.html","bookId":296,"book":{"id":296,"title":"Strong and Steady Or, Paddle Your Own Canoe","description":"简介： It\u0027s ever so much better than my roomtwice as big, to begin with.
