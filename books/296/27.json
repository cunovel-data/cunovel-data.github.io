{"id":23267,"no":27,"title":"CHAPTER XXVI. BUSINESS EXPERIENCES.","content":"Walter began to think that selling books would prove a harder and more disagreeable business than he anticipated. He had been brought face to face with meanness and selfishness, and they inspired him with disgust and indignation. Not that he expected everybody to buy his books, even if they could afford it. Still it was not necessary to insult him by offering half price. He walked slowly up the street, wondering if he should meet any more such customers. On the opposite side of the street he noticed a small shoemaker\u0027s shop. \"I suppose it is of no use to go in there,\" thought Walter. \"If they won\u0027t buy at a big house, there isn\u0027t much chance here.\" Still he thought he would go in. He had plenty[Pg 247] of time on his hands, and might as well let slip no chance, however small. He pushed open the door, and found himself in a shop about twenty-five feet square, littered up with leather shavings and finished and unfinished shoes. A boy of fourteen was pegging, and his father, a man of middle age, was finishing a shoe. \"Good-morning,\" said Walter. \"Good-morning,\" said the shoemaker, turning round. \"Do you want a pair of shoes this morning?\" \"No,\" said Walter, \"I didn\u0027t come to buy, but to sell.\" \"Well, what have you got to sell?\" \"A subscription book, finely illustrated.\" \"What\u0027s the name of it?\" \"\u0027Scenes in Bible Lands.\u0027\" \"Let me look at it.\" He wiped his hands on his apron, and, taking the book, began to turn over the leaves. \"It seems like a good book,\" he said. \"Does it sell well?\" [Pg 248] \"Yes, it sells largely. I have only just commenced, but other agents are doing well on it.\" \"You are rather young for an agent.\" \"Yes, but I\u0027m old enough to work, and I\u0027m going to give this a fair trial.\" \"That\u0027s the way to talk. How much do you expect to get for this book?\" \"The price is three dollars and a half.\" \"It\u0027s rather high.\" \"But there are a good many pictures. Those are what cost money.\" \"Yes, I suppose they do. Well, I\u0027ve a great mind to take one.\" \"I don\u0027t think you\u0027ll regret it. A good book will give you pleasure for a long time.\" \"That\u0027s so. Well, here\u0027s the money;\" and the shoemaker drew out five dollars from a leather pocket-book. \"Can you give me the change?\" \"With pleasure.\" Walter was all the more pleased at effecting this sale because it was unexpected. He had expected to sell a book at the great house he had just called at, but thought that the price of the book might deter[Pg 249] the shoemaker, whose income probably was not large. He thought he would like to know the name of the lady with whom he had such an unpleasant experience. \"Can you tell me,\" he inquired, \"who lives in that large house a little way up the street?\" \"You didn\u0027t sell a book there, did you?\" asked the shoemaker, laughing. \"No, but I got an offer of two dollars for one.\" \"That\u0027s just like Mrs. Belknap,\" returned the other. \"She has the name of being the meanest woman for miles around.\" \"It can\u0027t be for want of money. She lives in a nice house.\" \"Oh, she\u0027s rich enough,—the richest woman in town. When her husband was alive—old Squire Belknap—she wasn\u0027t quite so scrimping, for he was free-handed and liberal himself; but now she\u0027s a widow, she shows out her meanness. So she offered you two dollars?\" \"Yes, but she afterwards offered twenty-five cents more.\" \"Then she must have wanted the book. She[Pg 250] makes it her boast that no peddler ever took her in, and I guess she\u0027s about right.\" \"I hope there are not many such people in town. If there are, I shall get discouraged.\" \"We\u0027ve got our share of mean people, I expect, but she\u0027s the worst.\" \"Well, I suppose I must be going. Thank you for your purchase.\" \"That\u0027s all right. If I like the book as well as I expect, I\u0027ll thank you.\" Walter left the shoemaker\u0027s shop with considerably higher spirits than he entered. His confidence in human nature, which had been rudely shaken by Mrs. Belknap, was in a degree restored, and his prospects looked brighter than a few minutes before. \"I wonder who\u0027ll make the next purchase?\" he thought. He stopped at a plain two-story house a little further up the road. The door was opened by an old lady. \"What do you want?\" she asked. [Pg 251] \"I am agent for an excellent book,\" commenced Walter. \"Oh, you\u0027re a peddler,\" broke in the old lady, without waiting to hear him through. \"I suppose I may be called so.\" \"Are you the man that was round last spring selling jewelry?\" \"No, I have never been here before.\" \"I don\u0027t know whether to believe you or not,\" said the old lady. \"Your voice sounds like his. I can\u0027t see very well, for I\u0027ve mislaid my specs. If you\u0027re the same man, I\u0027ll have you took up for selling bogus jewelry.\" \"But I\u0027m not the same one.\" \"I don\u0027t know. The man I spoke of sold my darter a gold ring for a dollar, that turned out to be nothing but brass washed over. \u0027Twa\u0027n\u0027t worth five cents.\" \"I\u0027m sorry you got cheated, but it isn\u0027t my fault.\" \"Wait a minute, I\u0027ll call my darter.\" In reply to her mother\u0027s call a tall maiden lady[Pg 252] of forty advanced to the door, with some straw in her hand, for she was braiding straw. \"What\u0027s wanted, mother?\" she asked. \"Isn\u0027t this the same man that sold you that ring?\" \"La, no, mother. He was a man of forty-five, and this is only a boy.\" \"I s\u0027pose you must be right, but I can\u0027t see without my specs. Well, I\u0027m sorry you\u0027re not the one, for I\u0027d have had you took up onless you\u0027d give back the dollar.\" Under the circumstances Walter himself was not sorry that there was no chance of identifying him with his knavish predecessor. \"What have you got to sell?\" asked the younger woman. \"A book beautifully illustrated, called \u0027Scenes in Bible Lands.\u0027 Will you allow me to show it to you?\" \"He seems quite polite,\" said the old lady, now disposed to regard Walter more favorably. \"Won\u0027t you come in?\" Walter entered, and was shown into a small sitting-room, quite plainly furnished. The book was[Pg 253] taken from him, and examined for a considerable length of time by the daughter, who, however, announced at the end that though she should like it very much, she couldn\u0027t afford to pay the price. As the appearance of the house bore out her assertion, Walter did not press the purchase, but was about to replace the book under his arm, when she said suddenly, \"Wait a minute. There\u0027s Mrs. Thurman just coming in. Perhaps she\u0027ll buy one of your books.\" Walter was of course perfectly willing to wait on the chance of a sale. Mrs. Thurman was the wife of a trader in good circumstances, and disposed to spend liberally, according to her means. Walter was not obliged to recommend his book, for this was done by the spinster, who was disinterestedly bent on making a sale. So he sat quiet, a passive but interested auditor, while Miss Nancy Sprague extolled the book for him. \"It does seem like an excellent book,\" said Mrs. Thurman, looking at the pictures. \"Just the thing for your Delia,\" suggested Miss Nancy; \"I am sure she would like it.\" [Pg 254] \"That reminds me to-morrow is Delia\u0027s birthday.\" \"Then give her the book for a birthday present.\" \"I had intended to buy her something else. Still I am not sure but this would suit her quite as well.\" \"I am sure it would,\" responded Miss Nancy. \"Then I will take it. Young man, how much do you ask for your book?\" \"Three dollars and a half.\" Mrs. Thurman paid the money, and received the book. \"I am much obliged to you,\" said Walter, addressing Miss Nancy, \"for recommending my book.\" \"You\u0027re quite welcome,\" said Miss Nancy, who felt some satisfaction at gaining her point, though it would not benefit her any. \"I\u0027m sure you are quite polite for a peddler, and I hope you\u0027ll excuse mother for making such a mistake about you.\" \"That is of no consequence,\" said Walter, smiling. \"I think if your mother had had her glasses on she would not have made such a mistake.\" He left the house still farther encouraged. But during the next hour he failed to sell another copy. At length he managed to sell a third. As these were all he had brought out, and he was feeling rather tired, he went back to the tavern, and did not come out again till after dinner. He had sold three copies and cleared three dollars and seventy-five cents, which he was right in regarding as very fair success. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3005/82950.html","bookId":296,"book":{"id":296,"title":"Strong and Steady Or, Paddle Your Own Canoe","description":"简介： It\u0027s ever so much better than my roomtwice as big, to begin with.
