{"id":23251,"no":11,"title":"CHAPTER X. MR. DRUMMOND\u0027S STORE.","content":"Mr. Drummond\u0027s store was of fair size, and contained a considerable and varied stock of dry goods. Not only the people of Stapleton, but a considerable number of persons living outside the town limits, but within a radius of half-a-dozen miles, came there to purchase goods. Besides Mr. Drummond there was a single salesman, a young man of twenty-two, who wore a cravat of immense size, and ostentatiously displayed in his bosom a mammoth breastpin, with a glass imitation diamond, which, had it been real, would have been equal in value to the entire contents of the store. This young man, whose name was Nichols, received from Mr. Drummond the munificent salary of four hundred dollars per annum. Having a taste for dress, he patronized the village tailor to the extent[Pg 89] of his means, and considerably beyond, being at this moment thirty dollars in debt for the suit he wore. Besides this young man, there had formerly been a younger clerk, receiving a salary of four dollars weekly. He had been dismissed for asking to have his pay raised to five dollars a week, and since then Mr. Drummond had got along with but one salesman. As, however, the business really required more assistance, he was quite willing to employ Walter on board wages, which he estimated would not cost him, at the most, more than two dollars a week. \"Mr. Nichols,\" said Mr. Drummond, \"I have brought you some help. This is Walter Conrad, a distant relative.\" (Had Walter been rich, he would have been a near relative.) \"He knows nothing of the business. You can take him in charge, and give him some idea about prices, and so forth.\" \"Yes, sir,\" said the young man, in an important tone. \"I\u0027ll soon break him in.\" Mr. Nichols, who gave up what little mind he had to the subject of clothes, began to inspect Walter\u0027s raiment. He had sufficient knowledge to perceive that our hero\u0027s suit was of fine fabric, and tastefully[Pg 90] made. That being the case, he concluded to pay him some attention. \"I\u0027m glad you\u0027ve come,\" he said. \"I have to work like a dog. I\u0027m pretty well used up to-day. I was up till two o\u0027clock dancing.\" \"Were you?\" \"Yes. There was a ball over to Crampton. I go to all the balls within ten miles. They can\u0027t do without me.\" \"Can\u0027t they?\" asked Walter, not knowing what else to say. \"No. You see there isn\u0027t much style at these country balls,—I mean among the young men. They don\u0027t know how to dress. Now I give my mind to it, and they try to imitate me. I don\u0027t trust any tailor entirely. I just tell him what I want, and how I want it. Higgins, the tailor here, has improved a good deal since he began to make clothes for me.\" \"Indeed!\" \"Where do you have your clothes made?\" \"In Willoughby. That\u0027s where I have always lived till I came here.\" [Pg 91] \"Is there a good tailor there?\" \"I think so; but then I am not much of a judge.\" Just then a customer came in, and Mr. Nichols was drawn away from his dissertation on dress. \"Just notice how I manage,\" he said in a low voice. Accordingly Walter stood by and listened. \"Have you any calicoes that you can recommend?\" asked the woman, who appeared to be poor. \"Yes, ma\u0027am, we\u0027ve got some of the best in the market,—some that will be sure to suit you.\" He took from the shelves and displayed a very ugly pattern. \"I don\u0027t think I like that,\" she said. \"Haven\u0027t you got some with a smaller figure?\" \"The large figures are all the rage just now, ma\u0027am. Everybody wears them.\" \"Is that so?\" asked the woman, irresolutely. \"Fact, I assure you.\" \"How much is it a yard?\" \"Fifteen cents only.\" \"Are you sure it will wash?\" [Pg 92] \"Certainly.\" \"I should like to look at something else.\" \"I\u0027ll show you something else, but this is the thing for you.\" He brought out a piece still uglier; and finally, after some hesitation, his customer ordered ten yards from the first piece. He measured it with an air, and, folding it up, handed it to the customer, receiving in return a two-dollar bill, which the poor woman sighed as she rendered in, for she had worked hard for it. \"Is there anything more, ma\u0027am?\" \"A spool of cotton, No. 100.\" When the customer had left the store, Nichols turned complacently to Walter. \"How did you like that calico?\" he asked. \"It seemed to me very ugly.\" \"Wasn\u0027t it, though? It\u0027s been in the store five years. I didn\u0027t know as we should ever get rid of it.\" \"I thought you said it was all the rage.\" \"That\u0027s all gammon, of course.\" \"Haven\u0027t you got any prettier patterns?\" [Pg 93] \"Plenty.\" \"Why didn\u0027t you show them?\" \"I wanted to get off the old rubbish first. It isn\u0027t everybody that would buy it; but she swallowed everything I said.\" \"She seemed like a poor woman, who couldn\u0027t afford to buy a dress very often.\" \"No, she doesn\u0027t come more than twice a year.\" \"I think you ought to have given her the best bargain you could.\" \"You don\u0027t understand the business, Walter,\" said Nichols, complacently. \"Mr. Drummond,\" he said, going up to his employer, \"I\u0027ve just sold ten yards of those old-style calicoes.\" \"Very good,\" said Mr. Drummond, approvingly. \"Shove them off whenever you get a chance.\" \"If that is the way they do business, I shan\u0027t like it,\" thought Walter. \"You can fold up those goods on the counter, and put them back on the shelves,\" said Nichols. \"Customers put us to a great deal of trouble that way sometimes. Mrs. Captain Walker was in yesterday[Pg 94] afternoon, and I didn\u0027t know but I should have to get down all the stock we had before we could suit her.\" \"Why didn\u0027t you pick out something, and tell her it was all the rage?\" said Walter, smiling. \"That wouldn\u0027t go down with her. She\u0027s rich and she\u0027s proud. We have to be careful how we manage with such customers as she is. That reminds me that her bundle hasn\u0027t gone home yet. I\u0027ll get you to carry it up right away.\" \"I don\u0027t know where she lives.\" \"It\u0027s a large, square white house, about a quarter of a mile down the road, at the left hand. You can\u0027t miss it.\" The bundle was produced, and Walter set off in the direction indicated. He had only gone a few rods when he overtook Joshua, who was sauntering along with a fishing-pole in his hand. \"Where are you going with that big bundle?\" asked Joshua. \"To Mrs. Captain Walker\u0027s.\" \"I\u0027ll show you where it is. I\u0027m going that way.\" Joshua\u0027s manner was considerably less deferential[Pg 95] than the day before, when he supposed Walter to be rich. Now he looked upon him as his father\u0027s hired boy. \"Isn\u0027t that bundle heavy?\" he asked. \"Yes, rather heavy.\" \"I wouldn\u0027t be seen carrying such a bundle.\" \"Why not?\" \"I feel above it.\" \"I don\u0027t.\" \"It\u0027s different with you—now I mean. My father\u0027s worth money, and I suppose you will be poor.\" \"I don\u0027t mean to be poor all my life, but I shall have to work for all the money I am worth.\" \"It\u0027ll take a good while to get rich that way. If your father hadn\u0027t lost his money, you could have fine times.\" \"I don\u0027t know about that. I never cared so much about inheriting money.\" They were passing the village school-house. Through the open windows floated the strain of a song which the children were singing. This was the verse which the boys heard:— [Pg 96]\"It\u0027s all very well to depend on a friend,— That is, if you\u0027ve proved him true; But you\u0027ll find it better by far in the end To paddle your own canoe. To \u0027borrow\u0027 is dearer by far than to \u0027buy,\u0027— A maxim, though old, still true; You never will sigh, if you only will try To paddle your own canoe!\" \"That is going to be my motto,\" said Walter. \"What?\" \"\u0027Paddle your own canoe.\u0027 I\u0027m going to depend upon myself, and I mean to succeed.\" \"That\u0027s all very well, if you\u0027ve got to do it; but I expect the old man will leave me twenty-five thousand dollars, and that\u0027s a good deal better than paddling my own canoe.\" \"Suppose your father should fail?\" \"There isn\u0027t any danger. He\u0027ll take good care of his money, I\u0027ll warrant that. I wish he wasn\u0027t so mighty stingy, for I\u0027d like a little now. But there\u0027s Captain Walker\u0027s. I\u0027ll wait here, while you go and leave the bundle.\" Walter performed his errand, and rejoined Joshua, who had seated himself on the fence. \"I\u0027m going a-fishing,\" said Joshua. \"If you didn\u0027t have to work you could go with me.\" \"I must hurry back to the store.\" So the two parted company. \"I wish he\u0027d been rich,\" thought Joshua. \"I\u0027d have borrowed some money of him. It won\u0027t pay to be polite to him, now it turns out he isn\u0027t worth a cent.\" Walter went back to the store with a lighter heart than before. There was something in the song he had heard which gave him new strength and hopefulness, and he kept repeating over to himself at intervals, \"Paddle your own canoe!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3005/82934.html","bookId":296,"book":{"id":296,"title":"Strong and Steady Or, Paddle Your Own Canoe","description":"简介： It\u0027s ever so much better than my roomtwice as big, to begin with.
