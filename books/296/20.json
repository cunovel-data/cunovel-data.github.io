{"id":23260,"no":20,"title":"CHAPTER XIX. THE TABLES ARE TURNED.","content":"\"I shall soon be able to prove it,\" said Mr. Drummond. \"The lady who bought the shawl came into the store half an hour since, and asked for another. When I told her that it would cost ten dollars, she said she only paid five for the one she had on. She then told us that she bought it of you a fortnight since.\" \"How did she know my name?\" \"She did not mention your name. She said that it was a boy she bought it of, and of course that can only be you.\" \"There is some mistake about this, Mr. Drummond. She has made a mistake. She must have bought it somewhere else.\" \"She would not be likely to make such a mistake as this. Besides, the shawl is like others I have.[Pg 176] How do you account for that?\" queried Mr. Drummond, triumphantly. \"I don\u0027t pretend to account for it, and don\u0027t feel called upon to do so. All I have got to say is, that I did not sell the shawl, nor pocket the money.\" \"I shouldn\u0027t be surprised if you had the money about you at this very moment.\" \"You are mistaken,\" said Walter, firmly. \"Show me your pocket-book.\" \"My pocket-book is my own property.\" \"You are afraid to show it. Observe that, Mr. Nichols. Does not that look like guilt?\" \"I am willing to show it to Mr. Nichols,\" said Walter. He took it from his pocket, and handed it to Nichols, who took it rather unwillingly. \"Open that pocket-book, Mr. Nichols, and show me what is in it.\" \"Shall I do so, Walter?\" asked Nichols. \"Yes, Mr. Nichols. There is nothing in it that I am ashamed of.\" Nichols opened the pocket-book and took out three bills. [Pg 177] \"What are those bills, Mr. Nichols?\" asked his employer. \"There is a one, here is a two, and here is—\" Nichols hesitated and looked disturbed—\"here is a five.\" Mr. Drummond\u0027s mean face was radiant with exultation. \"I told you so. I think we need no further proof. The stolen money has been found in Conrad\u0027s possession, and his falsehood and dishonesty are clearly proved. Hand me that five.\" \"Stop a minute, Mr. Drummond,\" said Walter, coolly. \"You are altogether too much in a hurry. You have proved nothing whatever. That five-dollar bill I brought from home with me, and I have kept it ever since, having no occasion to spend it.\" \"Do you think I will believe any such story?\" asked his employer, with a sneer. \"That is very plausible, Conrad, but very improbable. I have no doubt whatever that the bill is the same one which was paid you for the shawl.\" \"Then you are entirely mistaken.\" \"That remains to be seen. Mr. Nichols, I will[Pg 178] relieve you of that pocket-book. As the shawl should have been sold for ten dollars, the entire contents will not be sufficient to pay for the loss I have sustained.\" \"Mr. Nichols,\" said Walter, \"I forbid your giving that pocket-book to Mr. Drummond. He has no claim to it whatever. You may give it to me.\" \"I forbid you giving it to Conrad,\" broke in his employer. \"I don\u0027t know what to do,\" said Nichols, perplexed, looking from one to the other. \"You know that it belongs to me, Mr. Nichols,\" said Walter. \"I—I think I had better lay it down on the counter,\" said Nichols, by the way of compromise. Walter, who was on the outside, sprang to the counter, and seized it just in time to prevent Mr. Drummond\u0027s obtaining it. The latter was very angry at his want of success, and exclaimed violently, \"Walter Conrad, give me that pocket-book instantly.\" Walter, who had put it in an inside pocket of his coat, coolly buttoned the coat and answered, \"If[Pg 179] you had any claim to it, Mr. Drummond, you would not have to speak twice; but as it is mine, I prefer to keep it.\" Mr. Drummond, though he had an irritable, aggravating temper, was not one to proceed to violence on ordinary occasions. But just now he was thoroughly provoked, and showed it. He sprang over the counter with an agility worthy of his youth, and advanced threateningly upon Walter. \"Walter Conrad,\" he exclaimed furiously, \"how dare you defy me in this outrageous manner? Do you know that I can have you arrested; but in consideration of your being a relation, I may be induced to spare you the penalty of the law if you will give me what money you have towards making up my loss.\" \"So I would, if the loss had come through me. But I have already told you that this is not the case. I know nothing whatever about the shawl.\" \"And this,\" said Mr. Drummond, folding his arms, \"this is the viper that I have warmed in my bosom. This is the friendless orphan that I admitted beneath my roof, and made a companion of[Pg 180] my son. This is the ungrateful serpent who has crept into my confidence, and abused it!\" Mr. Drummond was an orator on a small scale, and the pleasure of giving utterance to this scathing denunciation caused him to delay his intention to obtain possession of the pocket-book by violence. Walter ought to have been withered by this outburst of righteous anger, but he wasn\u0027t. He stood it very well, and did not seem in the least affected. \"Behold his hardened effrontery, Mr. Nichols,\" pursued Mr. Drummond, unfolding his arms, and pointing at our hero with quivering fore-finger. \"I could not have believed that a boy of his years could be so brazen.\" \"Mr. Drummond,\" said Walter, \"I am sustained by a consciousness of my innocence, and therefore what you say has no effect upon me. It doesn\u0027t seem to be very just to convict me without evidence, and sentence me without trial.\" \"Will you give up that pocket-book?\" demanded Mr. Drummond, furiously, having indulged in his little flight of oratory, and being now ready to proceed to business. [Pg 181] \"No, sir, I will not,\" returned Walter, looking him firmly in the face. Mr. Drummond made a dash for him, but Walter was used to dodging, and, eluding his grasp, ran behind the counter. \"Mr. Nichols, help me to catch him,\" said Mr. Drummond, quite red in the face. But Nichols did not show any great readiness to obey. He let Walter pass him, and did not make the least effort to retain him. Mr. Drummond was making ready to jump over the counter, when Nichols, to his great relief, observed the ladies, already referred to, coming up the steps from the street. \"Mr. Drummond, the ladies have returned,\" he said hastily. \"Aha!\" said his employer, with exultation. \"Now we will be able to prove your guilt, you young rascal! Here is the lady who bought the shawl of you.\" Mrs. Blake and her friend, Mrs. Spicer, here entered the store. [Pg 182] Mr. Drummond went forward to meet them. His face was flushed, but he tried to look composed. \"I am glad to see you back, ladies,\" he said. \"You told me that you bought your shawl of a boy?\" turning to Mrs. Blake. \"Yes, sir.\" \"Come forward, Conrad,\" said Mr. Drummond, a malignant smile overspreading his face. \"Perhaps you will deny now, to this lady\u0027s face, that you sold her the shawl she has on.\" \"I certainly do,\" said Walter. \"I never, to my knowledge, saw the lady before, and I know that I did not sell her the shawl.\" \"What do you think of that, Mr. Nichols?\" said Mr. Drummond. \"Did you ever witness such unblushing falsehood?\" But here a shell was thrown into Mr. Drummond\u0027s camp, and by Mrs. Blake herself. \"The boy is perfectly right,\" she said. \"I did not buy the shawl of him.\" \"What!\" stammered Mr. Drummond. Mrs. Blake repeated her statement. \"Didn\u0027t you say you bought the shawl of the[Pg 183] boy?\" asked Mr. Drummond, with a sickly hue of disappointment overspreading his face. \"Yes, but it was not that boy.\" \"That is the only boy I have in my employment.\" \"Come to think of it, I believe it was your son,\" said Mrs. Blake. \"Isn\u0027t he a little older than this boy?\" \"My son,—Joshua!\" exclaimed Mr. Drummond. \"Yes, I think it must be he. He\u0027s got rather an old-looking face, with freckles and reddish hair; isn\u0027t so good-looking as this boy.\" \"Joshua!\" repeated Mr. Drummond, bewildered. \"He doesn\u0027t tend in the store.\" \"It was about dinner-time,\" said Mrs. Blake. \"He was the only one here.\" \"Do you know anything about this, Mr. Nichols?\" asked Mr. Drummond, turning to his head clerk. Light had dawned upon Nichols. He remembered now Joshua\u0027s offer to take his place, and he felt sure in his own mind who was the guilty party. \"Yes, Mr. Drummond,\" he answered; \"about a fortnight ago, as Walter was rather late in getting[Pg 184] back, Joshua offered to stay in the store for a while. He must have sold the shawl, but he must have guessed at the price.\" \"A mistake has been made,\" said Mr. Drummond, hurriedly, to the ladies,—\"a mistake that you have profited by. I shall not be able to sell you another shawl for less than ten dollars.\" The ladies went out, and Mr. Drummond and his two clerks were left alone. \"Mr. Drummond,\" said Walter, quietly, \"after what has happened, you will not be surprised if I decline to remain in your employ. I shall take the afternoon train to Willoughby.\" He walked out of the store, and crossed the street to Mr. Drummond\u0027s house.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3005/82943.html","bookId":296,"book":{"id":296,"title":"Strong and Steady Or, Paddle Your Own Canoe","description":"简介： It\u0027s ever so much better than my roomtwice as big, to begin with.
