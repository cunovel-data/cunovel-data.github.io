{"id":23244,"no":4,"title":"CHAPTER III. AT HOME.","content":"It was a terrible shock to Walter,—this sudden announcement of his father\u0027s death. When he had left home, Mr. Conrad seemed in his usual health, and he could not realize that he was dead. The news stunned him, and he stood, pale and motionless, looking into the house-keeper\u0027s face. \"Come in, Master Walter, come in, and have a cup of hot tea. It\u0027ll make you feel better.\" A cup of hot tea was Nancy\u0027s invariable remedy for all troubles, physical or mental. \"Tell me about it, Nancy; I—I can\u0027t think it\u0027s true. It\u0027s so sudden.\" \"That\u0027s the way I feel too, Master Walter. And only yesterday morning, too, he looked just as usual. Little did I think what was to be.\" \"When was he first taken sick?\" [Pg 29] Walter had seated himself on a chair in the hall, and waited anxiously for an answer. \"I didn\u0027t notice nothing till last night just after supper. Richard went to the post-office and got your father\u0027s letters. When they came he took \u0027em into the library, and began to read them. There was three, I remember. It was about an hour before I went into the room to tell him the carpenter had called about repairing the carriage-house. When I came in, there lay your poor father on the carpet, senseless. He held a letter tight in his hand. I screamed for help. Mr. Brier, the carpenter, and Richard came in and helped me to lift up your poor father, and we sent right off for the doctor.\" \"What did the doctor say?\" \"He said it was a paralytic stroke,—a very bad one,—and ordered him to be put to bed directly. But it was of no use. He never recovered, but breathed his last this morning at eight o\u0027clock. The doctor told me I must telegraph to your teacher; and so I did.\" \"Nancy, have you got that letter which my father was reading?\" \"Yes, Master Walter, I put it in my pocket without reading. I think there must have been bad news in it.\" She drew from her pocket a letter, which she placed in Walter\u0027s hands. He read it hastily, and it confirmed his suspicions. It was from a lawyer Mr. Conrad had asked to make inquiries respecting the Great Metropolitan Mining Company, and was as follows:— \"William Conrad, Esq. \"Dear Sir:—I have, at your request, taken pains to inform myself of the present management and condition of the Great Metropolitan Mining Company. The task has been less difficult than I anticipated, since the failure of the company has just been made public. The management has been in the hands of dishonest and unscrupulous men, and it is doubtful whether the stockholders will be able to recover anything. \"Hoping you are not largely interested, I remain, \"Yours, very respectfully, \"Andrew Holmes.\" Walter re-folded the letter, and put it into his pocket. He felt that this letter had cost his father his life, and in the midst of his grief he could not help thinking bitterly of the unscrupulous man who had led his father to ruin. Had it been merely the loss of property, he could have forgiven him, but he had been deprived of the kindest and most indulgent of fathers. \"I should like to see my father,\" he said. We will not accompany him into the dark chamber where his father lay, unobservant, for the first time, of his presence. Such a scene is too sacred to be described. An hour later he came out of the chamber, pale but composed. He seemed older and more thoughtful than when he entered. A great and sudden sorrow often has this effect upon the young. \"Nancy,\" he said, \"have any arrangements been made about the funeral?\" \"No, Walter, we waited till you came. Mr. Edson will be here in a few minutes, and you can speak with him about it.\" Mr. Edson, though not a professional undertaker,[Pg 32] usually acted as such whenever there was occasion for his services. When he arrived, Walter requested him to take entire charge of the funeral. \"Are there any directions you would like to give, Walter?\" asked Mr. Edson, who, like most of the villagers, had known Walter from his birth. \"No, Mr. Edson, I leave all to you.\" \"What relations are there to be invited?\" \"My father had no near relatives. There is a cousin, Jacob Drummond, who lives in Stapleton. It will be necessary to let him know.\" \"Would a letter reach him in time?\" \"It will be best to telegraph. Stapleton is forty miles distant, and it is doubtful if a letter would reach there in time.\" \"If you will write the telegram, Walter, I\u0027ll see that it\u0027s sent right off.\" \"I won\u0027t trouble you, Mr. Edson; you will have enough to attend to, and I can send Richard to the telegraph office, or go myself. I shall feel better for the exercise.\" \"Very well, Walter, I will do whatever else is necessary.\" \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3005/82927.html","bookId":296,"book":{"id":296,"title":"Strong and Steady Or, Paddle Your Own Canoe","description":"简介： It\u0027s ever so much better than my roomtwice as big, to begin with.
