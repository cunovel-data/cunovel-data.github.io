{"id":23271,"no":31,"title":"CHAPTER XXX. THE ROBBER WALKS INTO A TRAP.","content":"Walter\u0027s feelings, as he lay on his hard bed on the floor, were far from pleasant. He was not sure that an attempt would be made to rob him, but the probability seemed so great that he could not compose himself to sleep. Suspense was so painful that he almost wished that Jack would come up if he intended to. He was tired, but his mental anxiety triumphed over his bodily fatigue, and he tossed about restlessly. It was about nine o\u0027clock when he went to bed. Two hours passed, and still there were no signs of the apprehended invasion. But, five minutes later, a heavy step was heard upon the staircase, which creaked beneath the weight of the man ascending. Jack tried to come up softly, but it creaked nevertheless. Walter\u0027s heart beat quick, as he heard the steps[Pg 287] approaching nearer and nearer. It was certainly a trying moment, that might have tested the courage of one older than our hero. Presently the door opened softly, and Jack advanced stealthily into the chamber, carrying a candle which, however, was unlighted. He reckoned upon finding Walter undressed, and his clothes hanging over the chair; but the faint light that entered through the window showed him that his intended victim had not removed his clothing. Of course this made the task of taking his pocket-book much more difficult. \"Confusion!\" he muttered. \"The boy hasn\u0027t undressed.\" Walter had closed his eyes, thinking it best to appear to be asleep; but he heard this exclamation, and it satisfied him of Jack\u0027s dishonest intentions. The robber paused a moment, and then, stooping over, inserted his hand into Walter\u0027s pocket. He drew out the pocket-book, Walter making no sign of being aware of what was going on. \"I\u0027ve got it,\" muttered Jack, with satisfaction, and stealthily retraced his steps to the door. He[Pg 288] went out, carefully closing it after him, and again the steps creaked beneath his weight. \"I\u0027m afraid he\u0027ll come back when he finds how little there is in it,\" thought Walter. \"If so, I must trust to my plan.\" Meg looked up with interest when her husband re-entered the room. She had been listening with nervous interest, fearing that there might be violence done. She had been relieved to hear no noise, and to see her husband returning quietly. \"Have you got the pocket-book?\" she asked. \"Yes, Meg,\" he said, displaying it. \"He went to bed with his clothes on, but I pulled it out of his pocket, as he lay asleep, and he will be none the wiser.\" \"How much is there in it?\" \"I\u0027m going to see. I haven\u0027t opened it yet.\" He opened the pocket-book, and uttered a cry of disappointment. \"That\u0027s all,\" he said, displaying the five-dollar bill. \"He must have had more.\" \"He did have more. When he paid me the dollar for stoppin\u0027 here, he took it from a roll of bills.\" [Pg 289] \"What\u0027s he done with \u0027em, the young rascal?\" \"Perhaps he had another pocket-book. But that\u0027s the one he took out when he paid me.\" \"I must go up again, Meg. He had seventy dollars, and I\u0027m goin\u0027 to have the rest. Five dollars won\u0027t pay me for the trouble of stealin\u0027 it.\" \"Don\u0027t hurt the boy, Jack.\" \"I will, if he don\u0027t fork over the money,\" said her husband, fiercely. There was no longer any thought of concealment. It was necessary to wake Walter to find out where he had put the money. So Jack went upstairs boldly, not trying to soften the noise of his steps now, angry to think that he had been put to this extra trouble. Walter heard him coming, and guessed what brought him back. I will not deny that he felt nervous, but he determined to act manfully, whatever might be the result. He breathed a short prayer to God for help, for he knew that in times of peril he is the only sufficient help. The door was thrown open, and Jack strode in, bearing in his hand a candle, this time lighted. He[Pg 290] advanced to the bed, and, bending over, shook Walter vigorously. \"What\u0027s the matter?\" asked our hero, this time opening his eyes, and assuming a look of surprise. \"Is it time to get up?\" \"It\u0027s time for you to get up.\" \"It isn\u0027t morning, is it?\" \"No; but I\u0027ve got something to say to you.\" \"Well,\" said Walter, sitting up in the bed, \"I\u0027m ready.\" \"Where\u0027ve you put that money you had last night?\" \"Why do you want to know?\" demanded Walter, eying his host fixedly. \"No matter why I want to know,\" said Jack, impatiently. \"Tell me, if you know what\u0027s best for yourself.\" Walter put his hand in his pocket. \"It was in my pocket-book,\" he said; \"but it\u0027s gone.\" \"Here is your pocket-book,\" said Jack, producing it. [Pg 291] \"Did you take it out of my pocket? What made you take it?\" \"None of your impudence, boy!\" \"Is it impudent to ask what made you take my property?\" said Walter, firmly. \"Yes, it is,\" said Jack, with an oath. \"Do you mean to steal my money?\" \"Yes, I do; and the sooner you hand it over the better.\" \"You have got my pocket-book already.\" \"Perhaps you think I am green,\" sneered Jack. \"I found only five dollars.\" \"Then you had better give it back to me. Five dollars isn\u0027t worth taking.\" \"You\u0027re a cool one, and no mistake,\" said Jack, surveying our hero with greater respect than he had before manifested. \"Do you know that I could wring your neck?\" \"Yes, I suppose you could,\" said Walter, quietly. \"You are a great deal stronger than I am.\" \"Aint you afraid of me?\" \"I don\u0027t think I am. Why should I be?\" [Pg 292] \"What\u0027s to hinder my killin\u0027 you? We\u0027re alone in the woods, far from help.\" \"I don\u0027t think you\u0027ll do it,\" said Walter, meeting his gaze steadily. \"You aint a coward, boy; I\u0027ll say that for you. Some boys of your age would be scared to death if they was in your place.\" \"I don\u0027t think I am a coward,\" said Walter, quietly. \"Are you going to give me back that pocket-book?\" \"Not if I know it; but I\u0027ll tell you what you\u0027re goin\u0027 to do.\" \"What\u0027s that?\" \"Hunt up the rest of that money, and pretty quick too.\" \"What makes you think I have got any more money?\" \"Didn\u0027t you tell me you sold twenty books, at three dollars and a half? That makes seventy dollars, accordin\u0027 to my reckonin\u0027.\" \"You\u0027re right there; but I have sent to Cleveland for some more books, and had to send the money with the order.\" [Pg 293] This staggered the robber at first, till he remembered what his wife had told him. \"That don\u0027t go down,\" he said roughly. \"The old woman saw a big roll of bills when you paid her for your lodgin\u0027. You haven\u0027t had any chance of payin\u0027 them away.\" Walter recalled the covetous glance of the woman when he displayed the bills, and he regretted too late his imprudence in revealing the amount of money he had with him. He saw that it was of no use to attempt to deceive Jack any longer. It might prove dangerous, and could do no good. \"I have some more money,\" he said; \"but I hope you will let me keep it.\" \"What made you take it out of your pocket-book?\" \"Because I thought I should have a visit from you.\" \"What made you think so?\" demanded Jack, rather surprised. \"I can\u0027t tell, but I expected a visit, so I took out most of my money and hid it.\" [Pg 294] \"Then you\u0027d better find it again. I can\u0027t wait here all night. Is it in your other pocket?\" \"No.\" \"Is that all you can say? Get up, and find me that money, or it\u0027ll be the worse for you.\" \"Then give me the pocket-book and five dollars. I can\u0027t get along if you take all my money.\" Jack reflected that he could easily take away the pocket-book again, and decided to comply with our hero\u0027s request as an inducement for him to find the other money. \"Here it is,\" he said. \"Now get me the rest.\" \"I hid some money in that closet,\" said Walter. \"I thought you would think of looking there.\" No sooner was the closet pointed out than Jack eagerly strode towards it and threw open the door. He entered it, and began to peer about him, holding the candle in his hand. \"Where did you put it?\" he inquired, turning to question Walter. But he had scarcely spoken when our hero closed the door hastily, and, before Jack could recover from his surprise, had bolted it on the outside. To add to[Pg 295] the discomfiture of the imprisoned robber, the wind produced by the violent slamming of the door blew out the candle, and he found himself a captive, in utter darkness. \"Let me out, or I\u0027ll murder you!\" he roared, kicking the barrier that separated him from his late victim, now his captor. Walter saw that there was no time to lose. The door, though strong, would probably soon give way before the strength of his prisoner. When the liberation took place, he must be gone. He held the handle of his carpet-bag between his teeth, and, getting out of the window, hung down. The distance was not great, and he alighted upon the ground without injury. Without delay he plunged into the woods, not caring in what direction he went, as long as it carried him away from his dishonest landlord. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3005/82954.html","bookId":296,"book":{"id":296,"title":"Strong and Steady Or, Paddle Your Own Canoe","description":"简介： It\u0027s ever so much better than my roomtwice as big, to begin with.
