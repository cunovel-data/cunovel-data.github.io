{"id":93585,"no":16,"title":"Page 16","content":"No! Closing my eyes, I jerked back, thumping my head against the wall. The baby goat let out a startled bleat, then tucked its nose beneath its hindquarters with a sigh. Caleb and Bethany slept on, unaware how close they had come to being food.\n Horrified, I looked around for an escape route. I couldn\u0027t keep this up. The Hunger was slowly taking over, and it wouldn\u0027t be long before I gave in to temptation. I needed to feed, before it grew too strong to ignore.\n Gently, I extracted myself from the sleeping kids and returned the newly christened Patch to his pen, where he promptly fell asleep. Once free, I slipped outside and leaned against the barn, pondering the inevitable question. It was time. That had been way too close. Who was I going to feed from?\n Not the kids. Never. I was not so inhuman that I would draw blood from a sleeping child. Teresa and Silas were so old, though, too weak to lose any blood, and I was not going to bite them in front of two sleeping children. Jake and Darren were on guard duty, and Ruth was with Zeke.\n Zeke was definitely out of the question.\n That left Dorothy the crazy woman, who was in the farmhouse gossiping with Martha, who didn\u0027t go to bed until midnight, apparently, and Jebbadiah Crosse.\n Yeah, right. I might as well just shoot myself in the face than go anywhere near Jeb.\n I growled in frustration. This wasn\u0027t getting me anywhere.\n When had I gotten so close to the people I was supposed to be feeding from?\n It always starts out that way. Kanin\u0027s voice echoed in my mind, quietly knowing. Noble intentions, honor among new vampires. Vows to not harm humans, to take only what is needed, to not hunt them like sheep through the night. But it becomes harder and harder to remain on their level, to hold on to your humanity, when all you can see them as is food.\n \"Dammit,\" I whispered, covering my eyes with a hand.\n How did Kanin do it? I tried to remember, thinking back to our time in the Fringe. He had some sort of code, a type of moral honor system, that he used when feeding off unsuspecting victims. He left something behind-like the shoes-\n payment for the harm his actions would bring.\n I couldn\u0027t do that now. I didn\u0027t have anything I could give.\n True, I was helping out, taking the night watch and all, but that was more of a group effort. We were all pitching in to help.\n But, I did save that man\u0027s life...\n Guilt and disgust stabbed at me. How could I even think about preying on a weak, caged human? Earlier tonight, I\u0027d been horrified to see him locked up like a beast, and now I was thinking of feeding off him? Maybe Kanin was right.\n Maybe I was a monster, just like he said.\n I could hear him now, his deep voice echoing in my head, as clearly as if he were standing beside me. Make your choice, Allison, he would say, calm and unruff led. Will you prey on those you consider friends and companions, or a stranger who already owes you his life? Know that each path is evil; you must decide which one is the lesser of the two.\n \"Damn you,\" I muttered to the empty air. Figment Kanin didn\u0027t reply, shimmering into nothingness; he already knew what path I was going to choose.\n I watched Jebbadiah Crosse finish praying over the wounded man, watched him stride back to the farmhouse, his severe form cutting a rigid path through the darkness. I watched the man in the cage, waited for his coughing and shifting to stop, for his raspy breathing to slow, becoming heavy and deep.\n When he was snoring quietly, I glided from the shadows along the wall, walking quickly to the woodshed and snatch-ing the key from where it hung on its nail. Silently, I removed the iron bar across the door, unlocked the padlock and removed the chains, being careful not to clink them against the bars. Carefully, being cautious that the door didn\u0027t creak, I eased it open.\n Joe Archer lay slumped in the corner, covered in blankets, his body curled into itself to conserve heat. His leg, heavily bandaged and reeking of blood and alcohol, lay at an awkward angle.\n Are you really going to do this?\n I shoved the voice aside, burying my feelings of horror, guilt and disgust. I didn\u0027t want to, but it was necessary. I didn\u0027t dare go into the farmhouse; with so many people under one roof, I didn\u0027t want to creep into a room only to be discovered by a light sleeper or someone getting up to use the bathroom.\n I thought of Caleb and Bethany, Zeke and Darren. If I didn\u0027t do this, they might be the ones in my sights next. I could kill them if I didn\u0027t feed soon. The cage was isolated, out of the way, and no one would be coming to check on him for a while. Better a stranger than someone I knew, someone I actually cared about.\n Besides, he owed me for saving his life.\n If that\u0027s what you want to tell yourself. Let\u0027s get this over with, then.\n Joe stirred in his sleep and coughed, his snores faltering.\n Quickly, before I had more second thoughts, I stepped up beside him and knelt, easing the collar of his coat aside. His throat, bared to the moonlight, pulsed softly. My fangs lengthened, the Hunger rising up like a dark tide. As the human groaned, eyelids f luttering, I leaned forward and sank my teeth into his neck, right below his jaw.\n He jerked, but relaxed instantly, succumbing to the near delirium of a vampire\u0027s bite. As blood began f lowing into my mouth, the Hunger drank it greedily, demanding more, always more. I kept a tight leash on it this time, fighting to keep my senses, to not lose myself to the heat and power f lowing into me.\n Three swallows. That was all I\u0027d allow myself to take, though my Hunger was raging at me for more. Reluctantly, I drew my fangs from the human\u0027s skin, sealing the wounds before stepping back. He groaned, half asleep and dead to the world, and I slipped out of the cage, replacing the locks and chains as quickly as I could.\n \"Allison?\"\n Just as I was replacing the last bar, footsteps crunched behind me and Zeke\u0027s familiar voice f loated over my shoulder.\n I turned, and he stood a few paces behind me, a thermos in one hand, a metal cup in the other.\n \"Here you are,\" he said, not accusingly, though he seemed puzzled. \"You never came back after Ruth left. Are you still angry with me?\"\n \"What are you doing here?\" I asked, ignoring the question. I wasn\u0027t angry, of course, but maybe it was better if he thought I was. He nodded to himself, as if expecting it.\n \"They\u0027re getting dinner ready in the barn,\" he continued, holding up the mug. \"If you want something, I\u0027d head over soon, before Caleb and Matthew eat all the soup.\" I nodded and turned away, watching Joe sleep through the bars of the cage. \"Did you know about this?\" I asked, hearing him move up beside me.\n \"Jeb told me.\" Zeke knelt close to the bars and reached through, shaking the unconscious man. He stirred with a groan, opening his eyes blearily, and Zeke held up the thermos. \"Hey,\" he murmured, unscrewing the top and pouring out a dark, steaming liquid. \"Thought you could use this. It\u0027s black, but it\u0027s better than nothing.\"\n \"Thanks, boy,\" Joe wheezed, reaching for the mug. His hands shook, and he nearly dropped it. \"Damn, I\u0027m worse off than I thought. How long until morning?\"\n \"A couple hours,\" Zeke replied gently, handing the cup of soup through the bars, as well. \"This will be over soon. How are you holding up?\"\n \"Oh, I\u0027ll live.\" Joe sipped at the coffee and smiled. \"At least for another day.\"\n Zeke smiled back, like he really believed it, and suddenly I had to get out of there. Spinning on my heel, I hurried away-away from the caged, doomed human who had been prey to me moments before. Away from the boy who showed me just how monstrous I truly was.\n \"Hey! Allison, wait!\"\n I heard Zeke jogging after me and I whirled on him, suddenly furious. \"Go away,\" I snarled, managing, barely, not to show fangs. \"Why do you keep hanging around? What are you trying to prove, preacher boy? Do you think you can save me, too?\"\n He blinked, utterly bewildered. \"What?\"\n \"Why do you try so hard?\" I continued, glaring disdainfully, holding on to my anger through sheer force of will.\n \"You\u0027re always giving things away, putting yourself at risk, making sure others are happy. It\u0027s stupid and dangerous. People aren\u0027t worth saving, Ezekiel. Someday that person you help is going to stick a knife in your back or slit your throat from behind, and you won\u0027t even see it coming.\" His blue eyes f lashed. \"How ignorant do you think I am?\" he demanded. \"Yeah, the world\u0027s an awful place, and it\u0027s full of people who would as soon put a knife in my back as shake my hand. Yeah, I could stick my neck out for them, and they\u0027d throw me to the rabids without a second thought. Don\u0027t think I haven\u0027t seen it before, Allison. I\u0027m not that stupid.\"\n \"Then why keep trying? If Jeb thinks this is hell, why even bother?\"\n \"Because there has to be more than this!\" Zeke paused, ran both hands through his hair, and looked at me sadly. \"Jeb has pretty much given up on humanity,\" he said in a soft voice.\n \"He sees corruption and vampires and rabids, and thinks that this world is done. The only thing he cares about is getting to Eden, saving the few lives he can. Anyone else-\" he shrugged \"-they\u0027re on their own. Even people like Joe.\" He nodded back toward the woodshed. \"He\u0027ll pray for him, but he keeps himself distant, detached.\"\n \"But you don\u0027t believe that.\"\n \"No, I don\u0027t.\" Zeke looked me straight in the eye as he said it, unembarrassed and unshakable. \"Jeb might\u0027ve lost faith, but I haven\u0027t. Maybe I\u0027m wrong,\" he continued with a shrug,\n \"but I\u0027m going to keep trying. It\u0027s what keeps me human. It\u0027s what separates me from them, all of them, rabids, demons, vampires, everything.\"\n Vampires. That stung a lot more than I thought it would.\n \"That\u0027s great for you,\" I said bitterly. \"But I\u0027m not like that.\n I don\u0027t believe in God, and I don\u0027t believe humans have anything good in them. Maybe you have a nice little family here, but I\u0027ve been on my own too long to trust anyone.\" Zeke\u0027s expression softened, which was not what I wanted to see. I wanted to hurt him, make him angry, but he just watched me with those solemn blue eyes and took a step forward. \"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027ve gone through,\" he said, holding my gaze, \"and I can\u0027t speak for everyone, but I promise you\u0027re safe here. I would never hurt you.\"\n \"Stop it,\" I hissed, backing away. \"You don\u0027t know me.\n You don\u0027t know anything about me.\"\n \"I would if you\u0027d let me,\" Zeke shot back, then crossed the space between us in two long strides, gripping my upper arms. Not hard; I could\u0027ve jerked back if I wanted, but I was so shocked that I froze, looking up into his face.\n \"I will if you give me a chance,\" he murmured. \"And you\u0027re wrong-I know a few things about you. I know you and Ruth don\u0027t get along, I know Caleb adores you, and I know you can handle a sword better than anyone I\u0027ve seen before.\" He smiled then, achingly handsome, his eyes liquid blue pools as he gazed into mine. \"You\u0027re a fighter, you question everything you don\u0027t agree with, and you\u0027re probably the only one here who\u0027s not terrified of Jeb. And I\u0027ve never met anyone like you. Ever.\"\n \"Let go,\" I whispered. I could hear his heartbeat, thudding loud in his chest, and was suddenly terrified he would hear my lack of one. He complied, sliding his hands down my arms, holding the tips of my fingers before dropping them. But his eyes never left my face.\n \"I know you\u0027re scared,\" he continued in a quiet voice, still close enough that I could feel his breath on my cheek. The Hunger stirred, but it was weaker this time, sated for now. \"I know we just met, and we\u0027re all strangers, and you keep yourself apart for your own reasons. But I also know I haven\u0027t...\n felt this way about anyone before. And I think...I hope...you feel the same, because that was really hard for me to say. So...\" He reached out again, taking my hand. \"I\u0027m asking you to trust me.\"\n I wanted to. For the second time that night, I wanted to kiss him, standing there so openly in the moonlight, his bangs falling jaggedly into his eyes. Zeke leaned forward, and for just a moment, I allowed him to step close, to cup the back of my head as his lips moved down toward mine. His pulse throbbed, his scent surrounding me, but this time, I only saw his face.\n No, this can\u0027t happen! I shoved him, hard. He staggered backward and fell, landing on his back in the dirt. I heard his sharp intake of breath, saw the shocked, wounded look in his eyes, and almost turned to f lee.\n I didn\u0027t. Against my will, against everything screaming at me not to do this, I drew my sword and stepped up beside him, pointing it at his chest. Zeke\u0027s eyes went wide at the blade, gleaming inches from his heart, and he froze.\n \"Let me make this as clear as I can,\" I told him, holding the hilt tightly so my hands wouldn\u0027t shake. \"Don\u0027t do that again. I don\u0027t trust you, preacher boy. I don\u0027t trust anyone.\n And I\u0027ve been stabbed in the back too many times for that to change, do you understand?\"\n Zeke\u0027s eyes were angry, wounded stars, but he nodded. I sheathed my blade, turned and walked back to the farmhouse, feeling his gaze on me all the way. But he didn\u0027t follow.\n Dawn wasn\u0027t far. I went back to the empty room and closed the door, being sure to latch it this time. My eyes burned, and I clamped down on my emotions before they spilled over my cheeks.\n In the bathroom, I splashed icy water on my face, gazing at my cracked ref lection in the mirror. Unlike the stories said, we actually did cast a ref lection, and mine looked awful: a pale, dark-haired girl with traces of blood running from her eyes, and someone else\u0027s blood f lowing in her veins. I bared my fangs, and the image of the girl disappeared, revealing a snarling, hollow-eyed vampire in the glass. If Zeke only knew what I really was...\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" I whispered, remembering the way he\u0027d looked when I\u0027d shoved him, when I\u0027d pointed my sword at his chest.\n Shocked, betrayed, heartbroken. \"It\u0027s better like this. It really is. You have no idea what you\u0027re getting into.\" I couldn\u0027t keep this up. It was too hard, seeing Zeke, keeping my distance, pretending I didn\u0027t care. It was also getting harder and harder to keep my secret. Sooner or later, I\u0027d slip up, or someone would put the pieces together and realize what had been lurking in their midst. And then Jeb or Zeke would put a sharp wooden stick through my chest or cut off my head. Zeke had watched rabids kill his friends and family, and he was the protege of Jebbadiah Crosse. I could not believe he would accept a vampire hanging around the group, no matter what he said about trust.\n Maybe it was time to leave. Not tonight-dawn was too close-but soon. When they left the compound, that would be a good time to go. I knew Jeb didn\u0027t want to stay much longer; he was already anxious to get on the road. I would see them through the woods, protect them from any rabids that might be lurking around, and then I would slip away before anyone realized I was gone.\n Where will you go? my ref lection seemed to ask. I swallowed the lump in my throat and shrugged. \"I don\u0027t know,\" I muttered. \"Does it matter? As long as I get far away from Zeke and Caleb and Darren and everyone, it doesn\u0027t matter where I go.\"\n They\u0027ll miss you. Zeke will miss you.\n \"They\u0027ll get over it.\" I left the bathroom, my mind churning with conf licting emotions. I didn\u0027t want to leave. I had grown attached to Caleb and Bethany and Darren. Even Dorothy had her strange charm. The rest I barely spoke to, and some-Ruth and Jebbadiah-I would be perfectly happy if I never saw again, but I would definitely miss the others.\n Especially a certain boy with starry eyes and an open smile, who saw nothing but good inside me. Who didn\u0027t know...\n what I really was.\n I slept with my sword close that day, the covers pulled over my head. No one disturbed me, or at least, when I woke again the following evening, the room was as I\u0027d left it. Lightning f lickered outside, searingly bright for a split second, and thunder rumbled in the distance. If Jeb wanted to leave tonight, it would be a long, wet walk out.\n Voices echoed through the stairwell, and I found the entire group downstairs, milling around the enormous wooden table that dominated one side of the kitchen. Ruth and Martha were ladling stew into bowls and passing them around, and a large bowl of corn muffins sat on the table within easy reach of everyone. Despite the feast, the mood around the table was somber and grim; even the kids ate silently with their eyes downcast. I wondered what was going on. Jeb wasn\u0027t here, and neither was Patricia, but I glanced up and met Zeke\u0027s eyes on the other side of the table.\n As soon as our gazes met, he turned, grabbed a muffin from the bowl and walked out of the room without looking back.\n My chest constricted. I wanted to go after him, to apologize for last night, but I didn\u0027t. It was better that he hate me now; I\u0027d be gone from his life soon enough.\n Instead, I wandered over to where Darren stood, leaning against a corner and dunking his bread in his stew. He glanced at me, nodded and went back to eating. But he didn\u0027t seem openly hostile, so maybe he hadn\u0027t spoken to Zeke about what happened.\n \"What\u0027s going on?\" I asked, leaning beside him. He gave me a sideways look and swallowed a mouthful of food.\n \"We\u0027re leaving soon,\" he muttered, gesturing to the back door, where all our packs lay, stacked in a neat pile. \"Probably in a couple hours, after everyone has eaten. Hopefully, we can get underway before the storm hits, and then the rain will hide our noise and our scent from any rabids in the woods.\n Jeb is talking to Patricia right now-she\u0027s trying to get him to stay for another night or two, but I don\u0027t think she\u0027ll get very far. Jeb already gave us the order to move out.\"\n \"Now? Tonight?\" I frowned, but Darren nodded. \"I thought we were staying until Joe got better.\"\n \"He died,\" Darren said softly, and my throat clenched in horror. \"This afternoon. Larry went out to check on him, and he was gone.\"\n He\u0027s dead? \"No,\" I whispered, as a growl of distant thunder drowned my voice. No, he can\u0027t be dead. Not after... Breaking away, I ducked out the back door and headed toward the woodshed.\n Outside, a few drops of rain had begun to fall, making pattering sounds on the tin roof. As I passed the barn, the animals inside were bleating and crying, and I heard thumps of bodies hitting each other and the walls, the scuff le of hooves on the f loor. In the twilight, the woodshed was dark and silent. Several logs had already been taken to feed tonight\u0027s fires, though the rain would drench the f lames soon enough.\n I wondered if the rabids got excited every time it stormed.\n As I rounded the shed, I saw the cage, and the body huddled in the corner, shaking. Relief swept through me. Darren had been wrong. Joe was still alive.\n \"Hey,\" I greeted softly, stepping up to the bars. \"You sure gave me a scare. Everyone thought you were de-\" Joe looked up, eyes blazing, and lunged at me with a scream.\n I jerked back, and the body struck the cage with a chilling shriek, grabbing at me through the bars, its skin pale and bloodless. The rabid howled, shaking the bars of the cage, biting and clawing at the iron, its mad eyes fixed on me.\n Sickened, I stared at the thing that had once been Joe Archer, at the once familiar face, now gaunt and wasted. His beard was covered in blood and froth, his eyes glazed and glassy as they stared at me, nothing in them except hunger.\n And my stomach twisted so hard I thought I might throw up.\n Did I do this? Is this my fault? I thought back to the previous night, when Joe had spoken to me, had accepted coffee from Zeke and even made a joke. He had been fine then. Had I taken too much that he had died, succumbed to the infection? Would he still be alive, if I hadn\u0027t fed from him?\n I heard the crunch of gravel behind me and turned, hoping and fearing it was Zeke. But it was only Larry, come to return the empty wheelbarrow to the woodshed. He set it aside and stared at the rabid a few moments, his weathered face crumpled with grief.\n \"Damn,\" he muttered in a choked voice. \"Damn damn dammit! I was hoping he wouldn\u0027t...\" He sucked in a breath, swallowing hard. \"I\u0027ll have to let Patricia know,\" he whispered, sounding on the verge of a breakdown. \"Aw, Joe. You were a good man. You didn\u0027t deserve this.\"\n \"What will happen to him now?\" I asked.\n Larry didn\u0027t look at me, continuing to stare at the rabid as he answered. \"Joe is gone,\" he said in a f lat, dull voice. \"We would\u0027ve buried the body if he hadn\u0027t Turned, but there\u0027s nothing left of him anymore. The sun will take care of the rest tomorrow.\"\n He shuff led away, back toward the farmhouse, leaving me to stare at the monster that had been Joe and feel completely and utterly sick.\n My eyes burned, and I felt something hot slide down my cheek. I didn\u0027t wipe it away this time, and more followed, burning crimson paths down my skin. The rabid watched me, cold and calculating. It had stopped throwing itself against the bars and now huddled against the back corner, unnaturally still, a coiled spring ready to be unleashed.\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" I whispered to it, and it bared its fangs at the sound of my voice. \"I did this. You\u0027d still be alive if I hadn\u0027t bitten you. I\u0027m so sorry, Joe.\"\n \"I knew it,\" someone hissed behind me.\n I whirled. Ruth peered at me from around the corner of the woodshed, her brown eyes wide with shock. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-immortal-rules-blood-of-eden-1/page-16.html","bookId":1614,"book":{"id":1614,"title":"The Immortal Rules (Blood of Eden #1)","description":"Storyline: \n The Immortal Rules (Blood of Eden #1) \n Allison Sekemoto survives in the Fringe, the outermost circle of a walled-in city.
