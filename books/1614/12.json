{"id":93581,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"The next evening, I woke up groggy and a bit disoriented. I wasn\u0027t in the cool, comforting earth; I\u0027d taken shelter in a top room of the old apartment complex the previous night, well away from the group below. I\u0027d had to climb a few f lights of broken stairs, and I\u0027d spent the daylight hours in a windowless hole of a room, lying on hard concrete, but it was necessary.\n I didn\u0027t want anyone tripping over my body in the daytime and realizing I slept like the dead.\n Dropping back to the ground f loor, I found most of the group just beginning to stir, as well. In the middle of the room, Ruth and an older woman with graying hair were starting to lay out food, opening cans of fruit and pouring them into metal bowls and cups. They seemed efficient as they opened a can, poured half the contents into a bowl, and handed it to a waiting child. Caleb, after receiving his share, trotted away with cup in hand, picking out yellow slices with his fingers. He stopped short when he saw me.\n \"Hi, Allie.\" Beaming, he held up his cup. \"Look at what Zeke and Darren found yesterday! It\u0027s sweet. Are you going to get some?\"\n \"Um.\" I glanced at the women and found Ruth glaring at me again. What the hell was the girl\u0027s problem? \"Not now.\n I\u0027m not really that hungry.\"\n His eyes widened, as if he couldn\u0027t believe what I had just said. \"Really? But, we hardly ever get food like this! You should try it, at least a little bit.\" I smiled wistfully, remembering when I had taken such pleasure in a can of fruit. I wished I could\u0027ve tried some, but Kanin had warned me that normal food would make me sick, and my body would expel it almost immediately. Meaning I would hurl it back up, something I did not want to do in front of a group of strangers.\n \"Here.\" Caleb held up a dripping yellow slice, and abruptly, the sweet, cloying smell made me slightly nauseated. \"Have one of mine.\"\n \"Maybe later.\" I shifted uneasily and took a step back, feeling Ruth\u0027s never-ending glare at the base of my skull. \"Have you seen Zeke?\"\n \"He\u0027s always with Jeb when we first wake up.\" Caleb stuffed the whole slice into his mouth, then gave me a yellow-orange smile. \"We usually don\u0027t see him until after breakfast.\"\n \"Here, dearie.\" An older woman stepped in front of me, holding out a bowl. It was half full of slimy, colorful fruit chunks, and my stomach recoiled at the sight of it. \"We never got to thank you for finding Caleb last night. I know you must be hungry-go ahead and eat. We won\u0027t tell the others you skipped your place in line.\"\n I stif led a sigh and took the bowl. \"Thank you,\" I told her, and she smiled.\n \"You\u0027re one of us now,\" she said and hobbled back to the others, favoring her left leg. I tried to remember her name and failed.\n Taking the bowl with me, I walked outside, looking for Zeke.\n I found him talking to Darren near the broken gate, discussing plans for the night. Physically, Darren and Zeke were similar, all lean muscle and wiry strength, though Darren was dark where Zeke was pale and fair. Between them, the pair probably did most of the harder physical tasks, since the majority of the group were women, kids and old people. There was a middle-aged black man-Jake, I think his name was-who helped out as well, but he had a bad shoulder so the harder tasks fell to the two boys.\n \"I think we should spend some more time scavenging, too,\" Zeke was saying as I came up, \"but Jeb wants everyone to move out as soon as they\u0027ve finished eating. He already thinks we\u0027ve wasted too much time here. You want to argue, you take it up with him. Oh, hey, Allison.\" He nodded pleasantly, and Darren scowled at me and walked off. I jerked my thumb at his back.\n \"What\u0027s with him?\"\n \"Darren?\" Zeke shrugged. \"He\u0027s just being sulky, don\u0027t worry about it. He thinks we should wait another night before moving on, search the rest of the town for food and supplies.\n We got lucky yesterday. Found a mini-mart that hadn\u0027t been picked clean, and Dare thinks there could be more nearby.\"\n He sighed and shook his head. \"He has a point. Unfortunately, once Jeb says it\u0027s time to go, it\u0027s time to go.\"\n \"That\u0027s insane. Here.\" I handed him the bowl. He blinked in surprise but took it with a murmur of thanks. \"He won\u0027t even stop for food? What\u0027s the hurry?\"\n \"He\u0027s always been like that,\" Zeke replied with a careless shrug, and picked out a chunk of white fruit, tossing it back.\n \"Hey, don\u0027t look at me. I don\u0027t make the rules. I just carry them out. But Jeb has our best interests at heart, always, so don\u0027t worry about it. Speaking of which, did you get anything to eat? We\u0027re not going to stop for several hours, and you should have something for the march.\"\n \"I\u0027m good,\" I told him, avoiding his eyes. \"I already ate.\"\n \"Ezekiel!\" called a familiar voice. Jeb walked out of the apartments and motioned to him. \"Are we almost ready?\"\n \"Yes, sir!\" Zeke called back and headed in his direction.\n But he stopped and gave the bowl to the elderly man sitting on the fountain ruins before continuing toward Jeb. \"Everyone is packing up. As soon as we\u0027re all finished eating, we\u0027re ready to go.\"\n They walked off, still discussing. I turned and came face-to-face with Ruth.\n The other girl held my gaze. We were about the same height, so I could see right into her dark brown eyes. Oh, man, she didn\u0027t just dislike me, she loathed me. Which was pretty ungrateful, I thought. Especially since I had saved her darling little brother. Especially since I had no idea why she hated me so much.\n \"Can I help you?\" I asked, arching an eyebrow at her.\n She f lushed. \"I know who you are,\" she huffed, making my stomach lurch. \"I know why you\u0027re here, why you\u0027re hanging around.\"\n Narrowing my eyes, I regarded her intently, wondering if she knew what a dangerous position she was in. \"Is that so?\"\n \"Yes. And I\u0027m here to tell you to forget it. Zeke isn\u0027t interested.\"\n Ah,\n now it all made sense. I almost laughed in her face.\n \"Look, you don\u0027t have to worry,\" I said, trying to be reasonable. \"I\u0027m not interested that way, either.\"\n \"Good,\" she said, watching me intently. \"\u0027Cause there\u0027s something about you that isn\u0027t...right.\" My amusement vanished. My senses prickled a warning, and the vampire within urged me to attack, to silence her before she became a problem. I shut it down, hard. \"Aren\u0027t you taking this \u0027don\u0027t talk to strangers\u0027 thing a little far?\" I asked.\n Ruth\u0027s lips tightened. \"You\u0027re hiding something,\" she said, taking a step back. \"I don\u0027t know what it is, and I don\u0027t care, but Zeke is too good to be ruined by someone like you. He has the unfortunate habit of seeing the good in everyone, and he\u0027s too nice to realize he\u0027s being taken advantage of. So I\u0027m warning you now, keep your dirty claws away from him. I\u0027ll make you sorry you ever came here if you don\u0027t.\" Before I could respond, she f lounced off, dark curls bouncing. \"And stay away from Caleb, too,\" she called back over her shoulder.\n \"Charming,\" I muttered under my breath and felt my fangs poking my gums. \"Well, we know who\u0027s going to get bitten first now, don\u0027t we?\"\n Not long after that, fed, packed up and ready to march, the small group of eleven people gathered around the fountain, talking quietly with each other and shooting curious glances at me, hanging back in the shadows. Then, as if prodded by an invisible signal, we started moving out; three teens, five adults, three children and a vampire, weaving silently through town and onto the road. They walked quickly-even the kids and the two elderly people moved with a sense of purpose-\n and soon the town faded behind us.\n \"So, Allison, was it? You came from a vampire city. Did you see many of the soulless devils wandering about?\" I repressed a sigh. That was the question of the night, it seemed. I\u0027d already been asked something similar by Teresa, the old woman with the bad leg; Matthew, a freckly ten-year-old; and Ruth, who inquired with a perfectly straight face if I had been a vampire\u0027s whore. Of course, then Caleb had to ask what a whore was, and Ruth gave him a very vague and watered-down explanation, all the while smiling at me over his head. If Zeke and Jeb hadn\u0027t been nearby, out of earshot of course, I might\u0027ve punched the smug bitch in the nose.\n This time, the question came from Dorothy, a middle-aged blond woman with vacant green eyes and a smile to match.\n She would often wander a little behind the rest of the group, staring down the road or toward the horizon, always smiling.\n Sometimes she waved to things in the distance-things that were never there. Other times she would randomly break into song, belting out \"Amazing Grace\" or \"On a Hill Far Away\" at the top of her lungs until someone told her, very nicely, to shush.\n I suspected she was a few bricks short of a full load. But there were also times where she seemed perfectly coherent and normal. Times like now, unfortunately, when she was sane enough to ask questions I really didn\u0027t want to answer.\n \"No,\" I muttered, keeping my gaze on the road ahead.\n Don\u0027t make eye contact with the crazy woman; don\u0027t look at her and maybe she\u0027ll go away. \"I didn\u0027t see many vampires \u0027wandering about.\u0027 I didn\u0027t see many vampires, period.\"\n \"How do you know?\" Dorothy asked, and I gave her a suspicious look, forgetting not to make eye contact. She smiled emptily. \"Vampire devils are masters of disguise,\" she went on, to my extreme discomfort. \"People think they\u0027re slaver-ing monsters with red eyes and fangs, but that\u0027s what they want you to think. Really, they can look like anyone else.\" Her voice dropped to a whisper. \"That\u0027s what makes them so dangerous. They can look perfectly human. They can look just like Teresa. Or me. Or you.\"\n I felt a f lutter of panic and squashed it down. \"I don\u0027t know, then,\" I told her with a shrug. \"I saw lots of people in the city.\n Maybe they were all vampires-I couldn\u0027t tell.\"\n \"Oh, there are other ways to tell if a person is really a devil,\" Dorothy continued, nodding seriously. \"Devils hate the sun. They burst into f lame in the light. Devils can\u0027t resist the sight of blood, and they don\u0027t breathe like we do. But most important...\" She leaned in, and I felt my fangs pressing through my gums, wanting to bite, to silence her. \"Most important,\" she whispered, \"devils are surrounded by this red glow, this aura of evil that only a few can see. You have to know what to look for, and it\u0027s difficult to see at a distance, but that is how you can tell a devil from a real person. Just like the white glow around the angels that walk down the road sometimes.\" She broke off, smiling dreamily at the horizon, where the pavement met the sky. \"Oh, there\u0027s one now! Can you see him? He\u0027s walking away from us, so it might be hard to tell.\"\n There was no one on the road. There was nothing ahead of us at all, except a large brown bird, perched on a fence post.\n I gave her a wary look and edged away, as she waved both arms in the air, making the bird f ly off with a startled whoo-whooing sound.\n \"Is that Gabriel? Or Uriel?\" She signaled frantically, then pouted. \"Oh, he disappeared! They\u0027re so shy. It might\u0027ve been Gabriel, though.\"\n \"Dorothy.\" Zeke was suddenly there, smiling as I shot him a desperate look over the crazy woman\u0027s shoulder. \"Allison doesn\u0027t know us very well yet. She might be nervous around your angels-not everyone can see them as well as you.\"\n \"Oh, right! Sorry, love.\" Dorothy squeezed his shoulder, beaming crazily, but he only grinned back. \"I forget sometimes. You\u0027re an angel yourself, you know that? Ezekiel. The angel of death.\"\n Now Zeke looked faintly embarrassed, giving me an apologetic glance as Dorothy patted his arm and turned to me.\n \"He thinks he can fool me,\" she whispered, loud enough for everyone to hear, \"but I know he\u0027s an angel in disguise. You can tell. When you\u0027ve seen as many angels as I have, you can always tell.\"\n She tried patting my arm but missed as I slid smoothly away.\n Unconcerned and humming softly to herself, she wandered to the side of the road and peered into the distance, probably looking for her bashful angels. Zeke sighed and shook his head.\n \"Sorry about that,\" he said with a rueful grin. \"Forgot to warn you about Dorothy-she\u0027s a little touched in the head, if you hadn\u0027t figured it out by now. Sees angels every other day.\"\n My body uncoiled in relief. For a second, I\u0027d thought I was in real trouble. \"Has anyone here seen a real vampire?\" I asked, wondering whom I should be wary of. \"Forget fangs and claws and red beady eyes, does anyone here really know what they look like?\"\n \"Well, Dorothy swears she\u0027s seen one, though she can\u0027t remember exactly when or where, so who knows if it was real. Beyond that...\" He shrugged. \"Jeb. Jebbadiah\u0027s whole family was slaughtered by a vampire when he was a kid, and he\u0027s never forgotten what it looked like. He says he\u0027s always remembered, so he can kill the vampire if they ever meet again.\"\n I looked at Jebbadiah, at the head of the group, walking briskly down the road without looking back. And I wondered what a lifetime of anger, resentment and hatred could do to someone like him.\n A few hours later, my internal clock was giving me the two-hour warning when Jeb held up a hand, calling the group to a stop. Zeke jogged up beside him, leaned in as Jeb spoke quietly, then turned to face the rest of us.\n \"Set up camp!\" he called, sweeping his arm to the side, and the group immediately began shuff ling off the road into the dry grass that surrounded us. \"Jake, Silas, you\u0027re on first watch. Teresa-\" he nodded at the old woman \"-Darren will help Ruth with dinner tonight. You should rest your leg.\n Keep off it for a few hours at least.\" Darren muttered some-thing as he passed, and Zeke rolled his eyes. \"Yes, poor Darren, forced to cook and clean and do other unmanly things.\n Next thing you know he\u0027ll be wearing an apron and popping out babies.\" He snorted as Darren turned and did something with his hand. \"We\u0027re friends, but we\u0027re not that close, Dare.\" I hung back, watching as Zeke cleared away a patch of earth, built a tent of sticks over a bundle of dry grass, and started a fire. Quick. Efficient. Like he\u0027d done this many times before. As I was wondering how long the group had been traveling, Ruth suddenly broke away from her tent and glanced up at me, raising an eyebrow.\n \"What\u0027s the matter, city girl?\" she called, smiling sweetly.\n \"Don\u0027t know how to set up a tent? A three-year-old could do it. Want Caleb to teach you how?\"\n I stif led the urge to strangle her, especially with Zeke nearby. \"No, I\u0027m fine, thanks.\" Hefting the bag on my shoulder, I marched past her, past the circle of tents around the campfire, to a spot about a hundred yards away. Dumping the tent onto the ground, I studied it fiercely.\n All right. I can do this. How hard can it be, really? Kneeling, I picked up a long metal spike, frowning. What in the world?\n Are you supposed to stab someone with these? Do tents come with vampire-slaying kits?\n Actually, it was fairly simple, once you figured it out. The metal stakes pinned the corners to the ground, and a couple plastic rods held it upright from inside. I was feeling fairly proud of myself, setting up a tent on the first try, when I fumbled with the rods and the whole thing collapsed on top of me.\n Laughing, Zeke slipped into the small interior as I cursed and struggled, shoving at the canvas. Grabbing the plastic frame, he maneuvered it into place with the ease of familiarity, snapping the tent upright.\n \"There,\" he said, still chuckling. \"That should do it. You got one of the f limsy tents, sadly. Not bad, though, getting it up on your first try. You should\u0027ve seen Ruth the first few times she tried setting hers up. I\u0027ve never heard such language coming from our delicate f lower.\"\n I smirked, feeling vindicated. \"It doesn\u0027t seem very sturdy,\" I admitted, gently shaking the plastic tube holding up the wall. Zeke chuckled again. He had a nice laugh, I decided, even if it was directed at me.\n \"Just don\u0027t hit the frame, and it\u0027ll be fine. Unless it\u0027s really windy outside. Or if someone accidentally bumps it. Or if an ant crawls on it.\" Zeke grinned. \"Actually we\u0027re all used to the tents falling on top of us. Most of us don\u0027t even wake up when it happens.\"\n I snorted. \"So, if a big storm comes through-\"\n \"At least you\u0027ll be dry as you go rolling across the plains.\" I laughed. It felt strange; I hadn\u0027t done that in a while. Then I realized how close we were, huddled together beneath this tiny dome of canvas. I could see the details of his face, even in the darkness: the lines around his mouth and eyes, the faint scar on his forehead, nearly hidden by his pale hair. I could hear his heartbeat, sense the blood pulsing in his veins, right below the skin. For a moment, I wondered what Zeke tasted of, how it would feel to draw him close and sink into that oblivion.\n It scared me, and I drew back. If I had been the slightest bit hungry...\n Zeke blushed, raking his fingers through his hair, and I realized I\u0027d been staring. \"I should go,\" he muttered, backing out of the tent. \"The others...I should probably help them.\" He pushed himself to a crouch at the entrance, balanced on the balls of his feet. \"If you need anything, just let me know.\n Dinner should be ready soon. Oh, yeah. And this is for you.\" Reaching off to the side, Zeke grabbed something and tossed it into the tent. It landed with a poof of dust: a thick blue-and-white quilt with only a tiny hole in one corner.\n Stunned, I looked up at him. A blanket like this could be traded for a month of meal tickets back in the Fringe, and he was just giving it to me? That couldn\u0027t be right. \"I...I can\u0027t take this,\" I muttered, holding it back to him. \"I don\u0027t have anything to trade.\"\n \"Don\u0027t be silly.\" Zeke smiled, a little puzzled. \"You don\u0027t have to give me anything for it. It\u0027s yours.\" Someone shouted to him across the camp, and he raised his head. \"Be right there!\" he called back, and nodded to me. \"Gotta go. See you at dinner.\"\n \"Zeke,\" I called softly, and he paused, peeking back into the tent. \"Thanks.\"\n One corner of his mouth quirked up. \"Don\u0027t worry about it. We look out for each other out here.\" He f licked the canvas wall, lightly. \"And like I said, if the tent falls on you in the middle of the night, don\u0027t panic. You\u0027ll get used to it. No one really worries about keeping things erect around here, and...\n Wow, that sounded bad.\" His blush returned, brighter than before, and he raked a hand through his hair. \"Uh...yeah, I should... I\u0027m going to leave now.\"\n Grimacing, he ducked out of sight. I waited until he was a good distance away before snickering into my quilt.\n After zipping up the tent f laps, I looked around my newest lair. I didn\u0027t like how f limsy it was, how easily someone could invade. I also wondered if the thin canvas would completely block out the sun when it rose directly overhead. I didn\u0027t know if I would wake up if I suddenly burst into f lames, or if I would quietly exit the world as my body burned to ash, but it wasn\u0027t something that I wanted to find out.\n I took out my knife and made a long slit in the f loor of the tent, revealing the grassy earth beneath. Now at least I had a quick escape if the sun penetrated my f limsy tent. Or if something unforeseen happened and I needed to get away quickly. Always leave yourself an out; that was the first rule of the Fringe. This group might seem friendly and unassuming, but you couldn\u0027t be too careful. Especially around people like Jebbadiah Crosse. And Ruth.\n Lying back, I pulled the quilt over my head, hoping no one would disturb my sleep. As darkness closed over me and my thoughts turned slow and sluggish, I realized two things.\n One, I couldn\u0027t keep this up forever, and two, Ezekiel Crosse was far too perfect to survive in this world much longer.\n That first week was a study in close calls.\n Thankfully, I didn\u0027t burst into f lames sleeping beneath the f limsy canvas tent, though I did wake up feeling uncomfortably warm, and wished I could simply burrow into the cool earth, away from the sun. As for the problem of guard duty, I spoke to Zeke the second night and convinced him to let me have first watch permanently. This meant staying awake a couple hours after dawn, and it was torture at first. My long coat protected me from the worst of the early morning rays, and I survived by staying in shaded areas whenever possible and never facing the direction the sun was coming up. But keeping myself awake was agonizing when my vampire instincts were screaming at me to sleep, to get out of the light.\n I finally started treating it as an exercise Kanin might have me do; building up my endurance to remain awake and active as long as I could.\n My human companions were another issue. Except for Ruth, who continued to be a catty pain in the ass, shooting me poisonous looks if I so much as glanced at Zeke, and Jeb, who treated me with the same harsh aloofness as he did everyone else, the group was pretty friendly. Which I wouldn\u0027t have minded, except they were also a curious bunch, always asking me questions about the city, what it was like living there, how I had escaped. I answered as vaguely as I could and finally managed to convince the adults that it was just too painful to remember that life anymore. To my relief, the questions finally stopped, and everyone was very understanding, almost to the point of pity. That was fine with me. Let them think I\u0027d been horribly scarred by my life in New Covington; it made it easier to hide the real reason I got uneasy whenever the word vampire came up.\n Unfortunately, that wasn\u0027t the only problem I ran into.\n Eating or, rather, the absence of it, was yet another diffi-culty. The group stopped twice for meals; once when everyone woke up and again near dawn when they set up camp.\n Rations were simple: half a can of beans or a few strips of dried meat, whatever they had scavenged or hunted or gathered.\n Mealtime was easily the most anticipated part of the day, and after a night of forced marching without a break, everyone was starving.\n Except me. And I had to get creative with ways to dump food without anyone noticing. Strips of meat or dried foods were easy; I hid them in my sleeves or pockets until I could toss them later. Canned beans, fruit and stew in bowls were a little trickier. When I could, I gave it away or dumped it into other people\u0027s bowls, though I could only do that so many times before people got suspicious. Sometimes I lied, saying I\u0027d already had my share, and once I even ate a few spoonfuls of tomato soup in front of Zeke and Jeb, managing to keep it down long enough to walk calmly behind a tree and puke it back up.\n I felt a little guilty, wasting food when it was so precious and scarce. And the Fringer street rat in me cringed whenever I threw perfectly good meat into the bushes or dumped half a can of corn down a dark hole, but what could I do? If I didn\u0027t keep up the appearance of being human, people would start to suspect. Like Ruth, who already had it in for me. I could hear her, sometimes, talking about me to the rest of the group, spreading suspicion and fear. Most of the adults-Teresa and Silas and Dorothy-paid little attention to her; they had bigger concerns than the jealous accusations of a teenage girl. But some of the others-Matthew, Bethany, even Jake-started eyeing me with distrust. As infuriating as it was, I couldn\u0027t do anything about it.\n Despite that, it was Jeb who worried me most, the silent judge, whose sharp gray eyes missed nothing. But even though he was the leader, he seemed apart from the rest of the group, separate. He rarely spoke to anyone, and everyone seemed afraid to approach him. In a way, it was a good thing he was so detached from the rest of us; he didn\u0027t seem to care what anyone did or said as long as they followed his lead. If it wasn\u0027t for Zeke, relaying his orders back and forth, he wouldn\u0027t interact with the group at all.\n In fact, I would\u0027ve bet that I knew more about the group than he did. I knew Caleb loved sweets and Ruth was terrified of snakes-something I took great pleasure in when I found a garter snake on the road one night and snuck it into her tent. The memory of her screams made me snicker the rest of the evening. I knew Teresa, the old woman with the bad leg, and Silas, her husband, had been married thirty-nine years and were getting ready to celebrate their anniversary next fall. I knew Jake had lost his wife to a rabid attack three years prior and hadn\u0027t spoken a word since. These facts and memories and snippets of their lives trickled in and stayed with me, even though I did my best to remain aloof. I didn\u0027t want to know about their pasts, their lives, anything about them. Because with every passing day, I knew I was going to have to pick one of them to feed from, and how could I do that when I knew Dorothy fainted at the sight of blood, and eight-year-old Bethany had nearly died one winter when a fox bit her?\n But it was Zeke who continued to fascinate and confuse me. It was clear that everyone adored him; despite being Jebbadiah\u0027s second, he was always helping, always making sure people were taken care of. Yet he never asked for anything, never expected any help in return. He was respectful of the adults and patient with the kids, making me wonder how he and Jeb could be so different. Or maybe, Jeb could be that way because of Zeke. That hardly seemed fair, to dump so much responsibility on Zeke\u0027s shoulders, because Jeb himself didn\u0027t want to get involved, but who was I to say anything?\n One night, when we made camp a bit earlier than usual, I wandered toward the campfire and was shocked to find Zeke sitting near the f lames, reading to Bethany and Caleb. Stunned, I crept closer, hardly able to believe it. But he was reading, his low, smooth voice reciting passages from the large black book in his lap, the two kids perched on either side.\n \"\u0027Moses stretched out his hand over the sea,\u0027\" Zeke said quietly, scanning the pages before him, \"\u0027and at daybreak the sea went back to its place. The Egyptians were f leeing toward it, and the Lord swept them into the sea. The water f lowed back and covered the chariots and horsemen-the entire army of Pharaoh that had followed the Israelites into the sea. Not one of them survived.\u0027\n \"\u0027But the Israelites went through the sea on dry ground, with a wall of water on their right and on their left. That day the Lord saved Israel from the hands of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians lying dead on the shore. And when the Israelites saw the mighty hand of the Lord displayed against the Egyptians, the people feared the Lord and put their trust in Him and in Moses, His servant.\u0027\"\n A bitter lump caught in my throat. For just a moment, I saw myself and Stick, huddled together in the cold shell of my room, an open book between us. Zeke didn\u0027t look up, didn\u0027t notice me, but I listened to his calm, quiet voice as he read, watched Caleb and Bethany hang on his every word and felt a strange sense of longing pull at my stomach.\n \"Ezekiel!\"\n Jebbadiah\u0027s voice echoed over the campground, and Zeke raised his head. Seeing the old man waiting for him several yards away, he closed the book and put it in Caleb\u0027s arms.\n \"Hang on to it for a second,\" I heard him murmur, ruff ling the boy\u0027s hair as he stood. \"I\u0027ll be right back.\" When Zeke left, curiosity drew me closer, wanting to see the book, to hold it in my hands and read the title. Bethany looked up, spotted me, and her eyes got wide. Scrambling to her feet, she ran off after Zeke, leaving Caleb sitting alone by the fire, a vampire looming over him.\n Puzzled, Caleb craned his neck, looking back at me, and smiled. \"Hi, Allie!\" he said as I moved up beside him. \"If you\u0027re looking for Zee, he just left. He\u0027ll be right back, though.\"\n \"Can I see that?\" I asked, pointing to the leather-bound tome in his arms. Caleb hesitated.\n \"It\u0027s Zee\u0027s book,\" he said uncertainly, holding it tighter.\n \"He told me to watch it for him.\"\n \"I won\u0027t hurt it,\" I promised, kneeling in the cool grass.\n \"Please?\"\n He paused a second more, then brightened.\n \"Okay, but only if you read me something.\"\n \"I...\" A part of me recoiled, remembering all those lessons with Stick, and how he stuck a knife in my back for my trouble. But I was still curious, and if this was the only way to see the book without tearing it out of Caleb\u0027s hands... \"I guess so,\" I said, and Caleb beamed at me.\n Handing it over, he scooted close and perched beside my leg, listening expectantly. Settling back, I gazed down at the leather-bound tome, the first real book I\u0027d seen since f leeing New Covington. It didn\u0027t have a title, just the symbol of a gold cross gleaming in the center of the cover, much like the one Zeke wore around his neck. I held the book on its side and saw the edges of the paper were gilded gold, too.\n \"Read something, Allie,\" Caleb insisted, bouncing next to me. I rolled my eyes and opened the book with a crackling of pages, turning to where a ribbon bookmarked the middle.\n It seemed as good a place to start as any.\n I read slowly, for the letters were tiny and strange, a style I hadn\u0027t seen before, \"\u0027Again, I looked and saw all the oppres-sion that was taking place under the sun: I saw the tears of the oppressed-and they have no comforter; power was on the side of their oppressors-and they have no comforter.\u0027\" I felt a chill in my stomach. When was this passage written? The tears of the oppressed, and the power of their oppressors, with no comfort on either side. It seemed to be speaking about the entire world, right now. I swallowed hard and continued.\n \"\u0027And I declared that the dead, who had already died, are happier than the living, who are still alive. But better than both...is the one who has never been born, who has not seen the evil that is done under the sun.\u0027\" I shivered and closed the book. Caleb watched me, a confused frown on his face. \"What does that mean?\" he asked.\n \"That\n that particular passage,\" said a new voice from above us, \"was not meant for certain little ears.\" Embarrassed, I stood quickly, facing Zeke, who had walked up with a half amused, half concerned look on his face. \"Go get dinner, rug rat,\" he told Caleb, who grinned and scam-pered off toward Ruth and the crowd that was gathering around her. Zeke looked at me, furrowing his brow, though his expression was more intrigued than upset. \"I didn\u0027t know you could read,\" he said in a low voice.\n I shrugged, holding out the book. \"Kind of a depressing story,\" I said, unwilling to reveal how much it spooked me.\n Zeke smiled as he accepted it.\n \"Some parts of it are,\" he agreed. \"But there are others that can be quite comforting, if you know where to look.\"\n \"Like\n where?\"\n He paused, then opened the book again, f lipping to a certain spot as if he had them memorized. \"This one,\" he said, handing the book back to me, pointing to a certain line. \"My favorite quote.\"\n \"Zeke!\" called another voice, Ruth\u0027s this time, echoing shrilly over the campground. \"Did you tell Darren he could have your share of the jerky?\"\n \"What? No!\" Zeke whirled around as Darren jogged away, laughing. As Zeke took off after him, Darren shouting he\u0027d better catch up before he ate his share of the meal, I bent to the passage Zeke pointed out.\n \"\u0027Yea,\u0027\" I muttered, stumbling over the archaic word,\n \"\u0027though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil. For you are with me.\u0027\" A nice thought, I mused, watching the boys chase each other around the campground. But I knew better. Jeb was right; there was no one watching out for us. And the sooner Zeke came to realize that, the longer he would survive this hell.\n The following evening, I crawled out of my tent to find Zeke and Darren crouched near the edge of camp, talking in low voices. Both looked as if they were trying to avoid attention, which of course piqued my curiosity. Brushing dirt from my sleeves, I ambled toward them.\n \"I knew this would happen,\" Darren muttered in a low voice as I approached. \"We should\u0027ve stocked up when we had the chance. Who knows when we\u0027ll come to another town?\"\n \"What\u0027s going on?\" I asked, squatting beside them. Zeke looked at me and sighed.\n \"Supplies are running low,\" he confessed. \"At this rate, we\u0027ll run out of food in a couple days, even if we cut back the rations.\" He stabbed a hand through his hair, raking it back. \"Darren and I are thinking of going hunting, but Jeb doesn\u0027t like the group to separate. Not when there\u0027s a chance we could run into rabids. Plus, we\u0027re using these,\" he added and held up a bow and a quiver of arrows. \"Which makes it even harder. It\u0027s almost impossible to sneak up on deer in the open, but dusk is the best time to try to bring one down.\" Across from Zeke, Darren gave me a brief, sudden smile. I blinked and returned it. At least the two boys didn\u0027t seem to care about a certain person\u0027s gossip-mongering, though I\u0027d never heard Ruth talking about me to Zeke or Jebbadiah.\n \"Why not use guns?\" I asked, remembering Zeke\u0027s handgun, and the sawed-off shotgun Jeb carried around. Zeke shook his head.\n \"We\u0027re pretty low on ammo,\" he replied. \"The only time we use firearms is for defense, or if it\u0027s an emergency. And since we\u0027re not quite there yet, it\u0027s bows and scavenged arrows for hunting.\"\n I looked down. There was an extra bow lying on the ground, unstrung and poking out from the square of oiled cloth it was wrapped in. Zeke followed my look and sighed.\n \"Jake usually comes with us,\" he explained. \"But lately, his shoulder\u0027s been bothering him and he doesn\u0027t have the strength to pull the cord back effectively.\"\n \"I\u0027ll come with you.\"\n The boys exchanged a look. \"I\u0027m a fast learner,\" I added, ignoring Darren\u0027s raised eyebrow. \"I\u0027m quiet, and I\u0027m stronger than you think. I\u0027m sure I can get the hang of it.\"\n \"It\u0027s not that,\" Zeke said hesitantly. \"It\u0027s just...I don\u0027t want to get you in trouble with Jeb, make him question his decision to let you stay with us.\" He jerked his thumb at the other boy. \"Dare just follows me around like a lost puppy, so it\u0027s expected of him-\" he dodged the dirt clump lobbed at his face \"-but you\u0027re new and he won\u0027t like it if you wander away from the group. It\u0027s probably better if you stay here for now. I\u0027m sorry.\"\n Annoyed, I frowned at them both, vampire pride sting-ing. If you only knew. I could bring down a full-grown stag before the pair of you realized it was there. But I kept my opinions to myself and shrugged. \"If you say so.\"\n \"Maybe next time, okay?\" Darren offered, giving me a wink. \"I\u0027ll show you how it\u0027s done.\" I bristled, but Zeke grabbed his bow and pushed himself to his feet.\n \"Let\u0027s get moving,\" he said with a stretch. \"Jeb won\u0027t leave without me-I hope-so this is on my head if he wants to punish anyone. People have to eat, whether he likes it or not.\n Allison,\" he added as I rose as well, \"will you let Jeb know what we\u0027re doing?\" He grinned at me. \"After we\u0027re a good distance away, of course. Ready, Dare?\"\n \"Sure.\" Darren sighed, slinging bow and quiver over his shoulder. \"Let the exercise in futility begin.\" Zeke rolled his eyes and gave the other boy a half hearted shove as he turned away. Darren swung at him in return, overbalanced as the other dodged, and strode after him as Zeke jogged backward, grinning. I watched their lean forms fade into the darkness, getting smaller and smaller, until they vanished over the rolling hills.\n Then I swooped down, grabbed the extra bow and quiver and turned in the other direction.\n \"What do you think you\u0027re doing?\"\n I sighed and looked over to where Ruth stood, two bowls of the night\u0027s dinner steaming in her hands, disapproving scowl firmly in place.\n \"Sneaking off, are you?\" she demanded, narrowing her eyes. \"Jeb won\u0027t like it. Where are you going?\"\n \"Why don\u0027t you just make something up?\" I said, taking a step forward, pleased when she hastily backed up. \"That\u0027s what you\u0027ve been doing all this time, right?\" She f lushed, and my smile widened. \"I notice you don\u0027t talk to Zeke or Jeb when you\u0027re spreading your lies. Afraid they\u0027ll see the forked tongue come out?\"\n She looked as if she wanted to slap me, and a part of me hoped she would. I bet she wouldn\u0027t be nearly so smug with a missing tooth. For a moment, she struggled to control herself, gripping the bowls of stew so that her delicate knuckles turned white. \"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about,\" Ruth said at last, and I snorted. Glancing at the bow in my hand, she sneered at me and raised her chin. \"You think you\u0027re going to bring something back? What do you know about hunting?\n If you think Zeke will notice your pathetic attempt to show off, you\u0027re sadly mistaken.\"\n \"Yes, shooting a deer so the lot of you won\u0027t starve because of the delusional paranoia of a madman is me showing off.\" I rolled my eyes. \"What a brilliant assumption. Why don\u0027t you go tell Jeb that?\"\n \"Don\u0027t be smart,\" Ruth hissed back, all subtlety gone. \"You think you\u0027re so special, just because you\u0027re from a vampire city. You think I don\u0027t see it? How you sleep away from the rest of us? How you try to be so mysterious, not saying anything about where you came from?\" She curled a lip in pure, hateful disgust. \"You just want attention-ours and Zeke\u0027s.\n I can see right through your act.\"\n This time I did laugh at her. \"Wow, you are a paranoid shrew, aren\u0027t you? Does Zeke know what an absolute bitch you can be?\" I snickered, and her face f lushed bright crimson.\n \"You know, I don\u0027t have time for this. Have fun with your theories, spread your poison around as much as you want. I\u0027m going to do something useful now. Maybe you should try it.\"\n \"You\u0027re a freak, do you hear me?\" Ruth called as I turned my back on her. \"You\u0027re hiding something, and I\u0027m going to find out what!\"\n I tried not to let her get to me as I jogged away from the camp, already scanning the horizon for moving prey. I tried not to think about turning back around, stalking her to the edge of camp, dragging her kicking and squirming into the night, and tearing out her throat. It wasn\u0027t that she was annoying, because she was, really, really annoying. It was because she was a threat, and my vampire instincts were telling me to kill, to silence her before she exposed me.\n I tried channeling those thoughts of death and violence into my current task, eager to be hunting again. I found a herd of the huge shaggy animals huddled together in a shallow basin but decided they were too big to bother with. Not that I doubted I could kill them; lose enough blood and they\u0027d die just like anything else. But if I went back to camp with one of those giant creatures slung over my back, I might draw suspicion.\n Instead, I prowled the rolling hills until I found a herd of small deer, browsing along a grassy ridge. Putting down the bow, I crept forward through the grass, staying downwind, until I could see the gentle rise and fall of their sides, smell the blood pumping hot in their veins.\n It was over very quickly. The small buck I\u0027d singled out didn\u0027t even know something was wrong until I was nearly right on top of him, and by then it was too late. The rest of the herd scattered as I charged into their midst, but I grabbed the deer\u0027s antlers as it was lunging to its feet, wrenched the head around, and quickly snapped its neck, killing it instantly.\n As it fell twitching to the ground, I resisted the urge to sink my fangs into its throat, knowing the stag\u0027s blood would do nothing for me. Hefting it to my shoulders, I walked back to where I\u0027d left my bow and quiver. Dropping the carcass, I took an arrow from the quiver and drove it into the stag\u0027s body, sinking it between the ribs. Maybe I was being paranoid, but explaining to someone why the deer had a broken neck and no arrow wounds could be awkward.\n Grabbing it by the horns, I started to drag it away, when a faint yet familiar rumble drifted over the grass, coming from the nearby road. As I froze, wondering where I\u0027d heard it be-fore, two headlights crested a hill and came roaring down the other side. My stomach twisted, and my blood went cold.\n Ducking into the grass, I watched the strange machines slow, then pull to a stop on the side of the road. A large bearded man swung off the vehicle, killed the engine and spat into the grass. His companion, a smaller human, pulled his machine to a stop, as well. For a moment, my mind went blank, and I had to kill the urge to f lee into the darkness and not look back.\n No. It\u0027s not possible. I killed them.\n \"Hang on a second,\" the larger human muttered, staggering unsteadily to the edge of the pavement. The other man sighed.\n \"What are you doing, Ed?\"\n \"I\u0027m taking a piss. That okay with you?\" The bearded man turned away from his companion, and a moment later there was the sound of falling water hitting the dirt.\n Staring at them, I felt myself sag in relief. They weren\u0027t the same men. This human had a shaggy brown beard, not yellow, and he was a little broader in the shoulders. But then I saw something else: a tattoo on his left shoulder-a grinning canine, sharp-toothed and pointy.\n The same as the ones before.\n The other man muttered something and swung himself off the vehicle, digging into his jacket pocket. Pulling out a small white box, he dragged a cigarette out with his lips, lit the end and settled back against his machine, smoking lazily. Ed finished zipping up, turned and caught the box as his friend tossed it to him.\n \"Any beer left?\" he asked, shaking out a cigarette.\n \"One can.\"\n \"Well, let\u0027s have it.\"\n \"Screw you.\"\n I watched them, my mind racing. From personal experience, I knew these men were bad news: violent, armed and ruthless. If they caught up with the rest of the group...I shivered.\n I had to stop them. Or at least get back to warn the others.\n But, as I crouched there, watching the men pass a silver can back and forth, I knew that-even running my fastest-I wouldn\u0027t have enough time. I\u0027d seen how quick those vehicles were. They would reach the group before I was even close. There had to be another way.\n Another way. Of course, there was the most obvious choice.\n The option I couldn\u0027t help but think of, no matter how much I tried ignoring it.\n Should I...kill them? The thought was tempting, and I felt my fangs lengthen in response. I could kill them, feed on them, hide their bodies and their vehicles, and no one would know. Who would miss them, way out here in the dark? But, as I inched closer to the unsuspecting humans, I remembered the last two I\u0027d met on a lonely road like this one. I remembered their screams, their terror, the panic on their faces. I remembered the glassy eyes and limp bodies, and clenched my fists. I couldn\u0027t do it. I was trying not to be that monster. Every death, every life taken by the Hunger, pushed me closer to my demon. If I started killing indiscriminately, it would completely take over, and then what would stop me from stalking Caleb or Zeke into the darkness and ripping out their throats?\n Maybe I could creep close enough to damage their vehicles in some way; slash their tires or drain their fuel. But I\u0027d have to get awfully close, and even with my vampire powers, there was the risk of being seen. Even if I did manage to pull it off, they\u0027d probably know someone was here and would be on the lookout for people in the area. That wouldn\u0027t be good for the group. I growled in frustration.\n Dammit, there had to be something I could do. Something to slow them down, just long enough for me to get back to the others and warn them. I looked up and down the road, searching for ideas, and noticed, in the distance, a large tree on the edge of the pavement.\n Breaking away from the humans, I hurried toward the tree and found a thick, gnarled old trunk that looked as if it had been struck by lightning several times. Its branches were twisted and bent, empty of leaves, and it looked more dead than alive.\n The roar of engines pierced the silence again. The men had started their vehicles, and were coming, their headlights gliding down the road. I put my shoulder to the trunk and pushed, digging my feet into the slippery grass and dirt, shoving with all my might. The stubborn tree resisted a moment, then with a brittle crack, its trunk split and it toppled slowly to the ground, landing half on and half off the road.\n The growl of the vehicles drew closer. If they got past this block, they would reach the group first, and I\u0027d have no time to warn everyone. Cursing, I grabbed the branches and dragged the old tree farther onto the road, expecting the men to come racing over the rise at any second. Bright lights lit up the darkness, illuminating the tree, and I dived into the grass.\n \"Aw, shit!\"\n The vehicles skidded to a stop. The men swung off, and one walked to the tree, giving it an angry kick that made the branches rattle. The other scratched his beard and gave it a disgusted look.\n \"Dammit,\" he muttered, peering into the darkness. \"Think we can go around?\"\n \"I ain\u0027t pushing my bike through that,\" the other snarled, stabbing a finger at the heavy weeds and brambles at the edge of the road, very close to where I was hiding. \"Last time I got a f lat, and it was a pain in the ass to get it fixed. Besides, the others will be coming through soon.\"\n \"Well, then shut up and help me move the thing.\" The other let off a string of expletives but moved forward to grab the trunk. I left the men struggling with the old tree, crept silently away and, as soon as I could, took off through the grass.\n I raced back to the camp, which was already packed up and on the verge of departure. I saw Darren and Zeke standing near the front with Jebbadiah and Ruth. Darren had a couple of skinny rabbits in one hand, looking uncomfortable, while Zeke seemed to be in an argument with the girl. They were still too far to notice me, but I heard snippets of their conversation, drifting over the wind, and strained my vampire senses to listen.\n \"I don\u0027t care if her tent is empty,\" Zeke was saying, holding out both hands in a pleading gesture. \"Jeb, we can\u0027t just leave someone behind. I swear, I saw her just before Darren and I left to go hunting. Ruth, are you sure you didn\u0027t see her go after us, or leave the camp?\"\n \"No,\" Ruth said in a voice that was almost as worried.\n \"Like I said, no one has seen her tonight, and when I realized that, I went to check her tent. It was empty, and all her stuff was gone. You don\u0027t think she left for good, do you?\"\n \"Regardless-\" Jeb\u0027s voice cut in, f lat and cold \"-we cannot wait for her. I made that clear from the beginning. If she has left us, so be it. If she chooses to f launt the rules, as you two have done tonight-\" he glared at Zeke \"-then that is her choice. She can live or die with the consequences.\"\n \"Well, it\u0027s good to know where I stand,\" I said, striding into the circle. All four humans whirled on me.\n \"Allison!\" Zeke exhaled with relief, but Ruth looked at me like she had just swallowed a spider. \"You\u0027re back. Where did you go? We were about to leave-\"\n \"Me behind? I noticed.\" I looked at Jebbadiah, who gazed back emotionlessly. If he felt anger or guilt that I\u0027d over-heard his conversation, he didn\u0027t show it. But I couldn\u0027t think about that now. \"Jeb, I saw men on the road, coming toward us. They\u0027re riding strange motorized bicycles, and they have guns.\"\n \"Motorized bicycles?\" Ruth said, giving Zeke a puzzled frown. Jeb, however, caught on much more quickly.\n \"Raiders, on motorcycles,\" he said grimly, and Ruth gasped. Briskly, Jeb turned on me and Zeke. \"Get everyone off the road,\" he snapped, pointing back to the group. \"We need to hide. Now!\"\n No sooner had he spoken than the faint growl of engines echoed down the road, and the glow of headlights appeared in the distance. People gasped, and one of the kids screamed.\n Quickly, Ruth, Zeke and I herded everyone away from the pavement, driving them back into the rolling plains. I snatched up forgotten cans, wrappers and bowls from the ground, f linging them into the tall grass, doing my best to cover the tracks a dozen people left behind.\n The raiders drew closer, the hum of engines roaring in the night. Diving behind a log, I f lung myself to the ground as the headlights pierced the spot where the group had been. A half second later, Zeke joined me, jumping over the log and dropping to his stomach as the raiders appeared over the hill.\n We peeked over the rim, watching the two men on those strange machines cruise past. Again, I was struck with how familiar they looked, how they were very like the two humans I\u0027d met earlier. The two men I\u0027d killed. One of them drove right by, but his companion suddenly pulled to a stop along the side of the road, shutting off his engine. The other turned his machine around and came back, pulling alongside his friend before shutting his off, too.\n \"Whacha lookin\u0027 at?\" I heard him growl. Even at this distance, my vampire hearing could make out the words perfectly. The other man shook his head.\n \"Dunno. I thought I heard something. A scream or something, out there.\"\n \"Rabbit, probably. Or coyote.\" The other man spit on the pavement, then pulled a large machine gun out of a side holster. \"Wanna fire a few shots to make sure?\" Beside me, I felt Zeke tense, one hand inching toward his gun, and I put my hand over his. Startled, he looked at me sharply, and I shook my head.\n \"Nah, don\u0027t waste bullets. It\u0027s probably nothing.\" The raider started his engine with a roar, and I caught the last few sen-tences over the sudden noise. \"Jackal is gonna be pissed if we don\u0027t find them. He was sure they\u0027re somewhere on this stretch.\"\n Jackal. Where had I heard that name before? It was instantly familiar; I knew I\u0027d heard it somewhere. It hit me then-the other raiders I\u0027d met on the road. The dead man had whispered it, right before he died.\n Jackal...would\u0027ve\n I felt a chill run up my spine. It couldn\u0027t be coincidence.\n The tattoos, the bikes, the raiders I\u0027d met before. There was something about this group I didn\u0027t know. Someone wasn\u0027t telling me something.\n \"Ain\u0027t our fault if they\u0027re not here,\" the other raider shrugged. \"Ain\u0027t nothing out here. And I\u0027m getting tired of looking for ghosts.\"\n \"Derrek and Royce certainly ran into something. Unless you think they just took off without their bikes.\" The other said something back, but the reply was drowned in the roar of the bike engines as the two men sped away down the road. I watched them leave, until the rumble of machinery faded into the distance, the lights disappeared, and everything was quiet once more.\n Slowly, the group came out of hiding, as if they were scared to make any noise.\n \"All right!\" Jeb\u0027s voice cut through the uncertainty. \"Listen up! It\u0027s no longer safe to use the roads. From now on, we avoid the main stretches. And I want double the guards on every shift! Zeke, you\u0027re in charge of that.\"\n \"Yes,\n sir.\"\n \"We still have plenty of ground to cover tonight, so let\u0027s move, people!\" And Jeb started away through the waving grass, the rest of the group falling in line after him.\n I wove my way to the front and fell into step beside Jebbadiah, who marched ahead without looking at me. \"What was that?\" I asked him. He continued to ignore me, but I wasn\u0027t about to let him off the hook. \"You knew those men,\" I continued in a low voice. \"Who are they? Why are they after you?\"\n \"You meddle in things you know nothing about.\"\n \"Well, yeah. That\u0027s why I\u0027m asking here. If I\u0027m going to help you people, I want to know what I\u0027m up against.\"\n \"We don\u0027t need your help,\" Jeb said icily. \"We didn\u0027t ask for your help. This group has been through hell and back, and they have survived this long because they do not question those responsible for their safety.\"\n \"Maybe they should,\" I said, and Jeb fixed me with an unyielding gaze.\n \"Do not rock this boat, Allison,\" he warned, raising one long, bony finger to my face. I wondered what would happen if I snapped it off like a twig. \"You are here because I permit it, because I turn away none in need, but you are not part of this family. I have come too far, and we have been through too much, for someone like you to endanger that. You have already demonstrated your complete disregard for our way of life. You will not come here and question my authority. And you will not ask questions about things you do not understand.\" He faced forward again, quickening his pace so that he started to leave me behind. \"If you are unhappy with the way we do things, you are free to go,\" he said without looking back. \"But if you wish to remain with this group, you must accept and obey the rules, like everyone else.\" I glared after him, falling back with the rest of the sheep.\n The rules. I\u0027d heard that before. Don\u0027t ask questions. Don\u0027t draw attention. Keep your head down and your mouth shut.\n Except I wasn\u0027t much of a mindless follower, particularly with rules that made no sense. If Stick-up-the-ass Jebbadiah wasn\u0027t going to give me answers, I would have to get them from someone else.\n Casually, I lagged behind, letting the others pass me, until I fell back with Zeke, bringing up the rear. He gave me a wary look, as if he knew I was about to ask him something uncomfortable.\n \"Hey,\" I said, and he nodded but didn\u0027t say anything, as if waiting for the inevitable questions. He\u0027d probably seen me talking with Jeb and knew I hadn\u0027t gotten the answers I wanted. Friendly and unassuming as he was, Zeke wasn\u0027t stupid.\n \"Listen,\" I went on, looking away. \"I...uh...wanted to talk to you. I didn\u0027t get a chance to before the whole raider thing, so...thanks.\"\n I felt his puzzled frown. \"For what?\"\n \"Not leaving me behind.\" I continued to stare at the horizon, watching a herd of those massive shaggy animals lumber away over a hill. \"I heard what you said to Jeb and Ruth, earlier. Thanks for...standing up for me. No one\u0027s ever done that before.\" I fell silent, embarrassed.\n Zeke sighed. \"Jeb isn\u0027t the...easiest...person to understand,\" he admitted, and I resisted the urge to snort. \"He wants to protect everyone, but he knows he\u0027s taking us through dangerous territory, and not everyone will make it. He\u0027s seen several of us...die, trying to get to Eden. We were a much larger group, once.\" He hesitated, taking a quick breath. I wondered how much he had seen, how many friends he\u0027d watched die.\n \"Jeb\u0027s only concern now is getting to Eden with as many of us as he can.\" Zeke gazed at me, unapologetic. \"If that means leaving one behind to save the rest, it\u0027s a sacrifice he\u0027s willing to make. His convictions are much stronger than mine, and sometimes I forget that.\"\n \"You\u0027re defending him because he\u0027s willing to let people die, to leave them behind?\"\n \"Sometimes, to save the many, you must sacrifice the few.\" He looked away then, a bitter smile crossing his face. \"Jeb tells me I\u0027m too soft and that my stubbornness is what keeps me from being a true leader. No, I don\u0027t want anyone to die, to be left behind, but that weakness might get the whole group killed.\"\n \"Zeke...\" I wanted to tell him that was screwed up, that Jebbadiah Crosse was a cold, unreasonable, heartless bastard, but I couldn\u0027t. Because, in some sad, twisted way, I agreed with him. Growing up in the Fringe, you came to accept hard truths. Nothing was fair. The world was cold, unforgiving, and people died. It was just the way things were. I didn\u0027t like it, but the old man\u0027s reasoning wasn\u0027t unjustified.\n Though I still thought he was a complete bastard.\n \"Anyway...\" Zeke shrugged, giving me a small, embarrassed grin. \"You\u0027re welcome. And I\u0027m glad you came back.\n It was a good thing, too-you got us off the road in time.\n Thank you for that.\"\n \"Sure.\" I paused, chewing my lip. Now seemed as good a time as any, but I wondered how best to bring it up. I opted for my usual dive right in approach. \"Zeke...who\u0027s Jackal?\" He stumbled, then looked at me sharply, blue eyes narrowing. I knew I had something and hurried on. \"The men said Jackal was looking for someone. It\u0027s you, isn\u0027t it? Or the group.\" I nodded to the people walking ahead of us. \"Who is he, and what does he want from you?\" Zeke took a deep breath, letting it out slowly. Dropping even farther back, he gave the group a wary look, his eyes lingering on Jebbadiah up front. \"None of them can know about this,\" he murmured as I fell back to join him. \"They don\u0027t know who Jackal is, and it\u0027s better that they remain oblivious. I\u0027m the only one, besides Jeb, who knows anything about him, so you can\u0027t mention his name to anyone, okay?\" He closed his eyes. \"And please don\u0027t tell Jeb that I told you.\" I nodded. \"Why the big secret?\" I asked, frowning. \"Who is this Jackal person, anyway?\"\n \"He\u0027s a vampire,\" Zeke replied, and my stomach clenched.\n \"A very powerful vampire. He leads a group of raiders all across the country, looking for us. The others think we just run into random raider gangs that want to hurt us. They\u0027re terrified enough without knowing what he is. But Jackal is their king, and he\u0027s been on our trail for a couple years now.\"\n \"Why?\"\n \"He hates Jeb,\" Zeke explained, shrugging. \"Jeb nearly killed him once, and he\u0027s never forgotten it. So, he hunts him for revenge, but he\u0027ll kill us all if he finds us.\" That didn\u0027t make much sense. \"So, you\u0027re saying this vampire king is sending his raider army on a wild-goose chase all over the country, looking for one person who could be anywhere, all because he\u0027s holding a grudge?\" Zeke looked away. I narrowed my eyes. \"What aren\u0027t you telling me?\"\n \"I can\u0027t say.\" Zeke looked back, eyes pleading. \"I promised Jeb that I wouldn\u0027t tell anyone. I won\u0027t break that promise, no matter what you say. I\u0027m sorry.\"\n I believed him, which was strange. I\u0027d never met a person who couldn\u0027t be bought, cajoled or bribed, but Zeke seemed the type that, once he promised something, would take his secrets to the grave. Still, it was frustrating, being left in the dark. Especially if the dark had a powerful vampire king lurking close by.\n I cast about for another topic, another way to extract his carefully guarded secrets, but something else he\u0027d said caught my attention. \"Wait a minute,\" I muttered, frowning at him.\n \"You\u0027ve been wandering around, looking for Eden, for a couple years? \"\n \"I think...\" Zeke paused a moment, brow furrowed. \"I think this summer will be our third year. Or is it our fourth?\" He raised one lean shoulder. \"It\u0027s hard to keep track, anymore.\"\n \"And you still think Eden is out there?\"\n \"It has to be,\" Zeke said in a fervent voice. \"If it\u0027s not, all the lives we lost, the people who put their trust in us, it\u0027ll all be for nothing.\" His face clouded with pain, before he shook it off, his eyes narrowed in determination. \"Every year, we get closer,\" he said. \"Every site we come to and it\u0027s not there, that\u0027s just one more step closer to finding it. Jackal and his gang, they\u0027re out there, looking for us. But they won\u0027t find us. We\u0027ve come too far to be stopped now. We have to keep everyone\u0027s faith alive. If they knew a vampire was hunting us, they\u0027d lose hope. And sometimes, hope is the only thing that gets us through the day.\"\n He sounded very tired, and I could suddenly see the terrible burden he carried, the weight of responsibility far beyond his years. I remembered the way his eyes had gone dark when I asked why the group traveled at night, the look on his face as he recalled something terrible. Death had marked him, the lives lost weighed on him; I could tell he remembered each and every one.\n \"What happened?\" I asked. \"You said you travel at night for a reason. Why is that?\"\n He closed his eyes. When he opened them again, he seemed a different person; the bleakness on his face transformed him into someone much, much older. \"In the beginning,\" he said, his eyes dark and far away, \"I was the only orphan in the group. There were a lot more of us back then, and we were all so sure we would find Eden before winter set in. Jeb was certain it was along the west coast. When we started out, no one thought that we could be wandering for more than a year.\" He shook his head, f linging bangs from his eyes. \"At first, we traveled during the day, when the monsters were sleeping. At night, we waited a couple hours after the sun went down before making camp, to make sure there were no rabids in the area. We thought that the rabids came out right at sundown, and if we waited an hour or two, we would be safe.\" His voice faltered, and he shook his head. \"We were wrong. Rabids...rabids rise when they want to.\" Zeke paused, took a quiet breath. \"One night,\" he contin-ued in a low voice, \"we made camp as usual, about an hour after sunset. It was at the top of a grassy hill, no trees, no bushes, no places for the rabids to hide or sneak up on us. We posted sentries around the perimeter, per normal, and went to sleep.\n \"I woke up to screaming,\" Zeke muttered, gazing at something in the distance, his voice dark and grim. \"They came right out of the ground, from the earth under our tents. No warning, nothing. They were just suddenly there. We didn\u0027t stand a chance.\"\n I shivered in sympathy. I could see the rabids coming out of the ground, right in the middle of the camp of helpless sleepers. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" I offered, knowing how weak that sounded.\n \"More than half the group was lost,\" Zeke went on, as if he hadn\u0027t heard. \"We would\u0027ve all died if Jeb hadn\u0027t been there. I froze-I couldn\u0027t move, not even to help the others.\n Through all that chaos, he managed to get the rest of us together so we could escape. But we left so many behind. Dorothy\u0027s husband, Caleb and Ruth\u0027s parents.\" He stopped, his face pinched and tight. \"I swore I wouldn\u0027t lose anyone else like that,\" he muttered. \"Ever again.\"\n \"You were a kid.\" We had drifted closer, somehow, our shoulders barely touching as we walked side by side. \"Jeb couldn\u0027t have expected you to face them all on your own.\"\n \"Maybe.\" He didn\u0027t sound convinced and kept walking with his head down, watching his feet. \"But that\u0027s why we can\u0027t stop. Even if there\u0027s a vampire out there who wants us dead. Even...if there is no Eden.\" He shuddered. \"We have to keep going. Everyone is counting on us to lead them there, and I won\u0027t take that away from them. All we have left is our faith.\" His voice dropped even lower as he looked toward the horizon. \"And sometimes, I wonder if that will be enough.\"\n \"Zeke!\"\n Ruth came skipping up to us then, smiling brightly, a tin cup clutched in one hand. \"Here,\" she said, wedging herself between me and Zeke, holding the cup out to him. \"I saved a little coffee for you. It\u0027s not much, but at least it\u0027s warm.\"\n \"Thanks.\" Zeke gave her a tired smile as he took the cup, and she beamed, ignoring me. I looked at her back, at the pale expanse of her neck, and fantasized about sinking my teeth into her smooth white skin.\n \"By the way,\" she continued, turning to me with wide, innocent eyes, \"why is there a big tear in the f loor of your tent? It looks like you purposefully cut it with a knife. What are you doing in there, slaughtering animals?\" Zeke looked at me, raising a puzzled eyebrow. Alarm f lickered, but I forced myself to be calm. \"There...must\u0027ve been a hole already,\" I said, thinking quickly. \"I have nightmares sometimes-it could\u0027ve torn while I was thrashing around.\" Zeke nodded and sipped his coffee, but Ruth narrowed her gaze, lips pursed in suspicion. She didn\u0027t believe me. A growl rose to my throat, and I swallowed it, before going on the offensive to distract her.\n \"Besides, why are you snooping around my stuff ?\" I returned, glaring at her. \"Looking for something in particular?\n I don\u0027t have anything you can steal.\" Ruth\u0027s mouth dropped open, her delicate face contorting in outrage.\n \"Steal? How dare you! I don\u0027t steal!\"\n \"That\u0027s good,\" I went on, smirking at her. \"Because, sometimes I kill things in my sleep. Particularly if they come poking around my tent unannounced in the middle of the day.\n Comes with living in a vampire city-stab first, ask questions later.\"\n She paled and shrank back against Zeke, who gave me a look of mild concern, unsure how to deal with two bicker-ing females.\n \"Freak,\" Ruth muttered at last and turned her back on me in blatant dismissal. \"Regardless, Zeke, I wanted to ask you about camp rations. We\u0027re awfully low-what do you want me to do tonight and tomorrow?\"\n He gave me an apologetic look. I rolled my eyes and walked away, leaving them to talk, as it was obvious Ruth wouldn\u0027t let me get another word in with Zeke. Not that she could\u0027ve stopped me; I had no issues staying where I was, just to spite her. But watching her with Zeke, hearing her heart beat faster just from being close, her pulse f luttering wildly in her neck, I felt, for the first time since that lonely night on the road, the first stirrings of Hunger.\n And I knew I would have to choose one of them, very soon. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-immortal-rules-blood-of-eden-1/page-12.html","bookId":1614,"book":{"id":1614,"title":"The Immortal Rules (Blood of Eden #1)","description":"Storyline: \n The Immortal Rules (Blood of Eden #1) \n Allison Sekemoto survives in the Fringe, the outermost circle of a walled-in city.
