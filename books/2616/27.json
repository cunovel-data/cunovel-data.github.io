She wasn\u0027t sure if it was because he was a vampire or because they were large and heavily fringed with dark lashes. His hand swept her hair to one side to fully reveal her face and he looked at her with a neutral expression.\n “Take what you need,” he said softly.\n Feeling insanely nervous, she slid her arms around his neck and pulled him close. She could feel his heart beating with fresh blood while her own was cold and silent in her chest. His hands were gentle on her shoulders as he pressed her close.\n “Drink.”\n This was far different from the other times she had fed. It felt infinitely more intimate and she felt awkward as hell. But her teeth were sharp against her tongue as she ran it over her lips and she knew she needed to feed soon or lose her mind. Placing her lips against his neck, she felt his pulse under her tongue and her eyes fluttered close. His hand pressed her firmly against him and she pushed her teeth slowly downward.\n His blood came cool and salty into her mouth. She fastened her lips tight against his skin as she pushed her teeth harder into him. It was delicious, rich and everything she needed. She pulled him closer, her mouth pulling hard on his skin. She heard him give out an involuntary gasp and his arms slid around her.\n Stumbling backward, they landed against the wall and Cian crushed her closer. Sucking harder and harder, she drained his blood, feeling it filling her, and spreading its delicious warming power through her limbs. Grinding her body against his, the feeding was turning into something vastly different and she could feel him harden against her stomach. She didn\u0027t want to stop for his blood was everything she had ever wanted or needed.\n Pulling her from him, Cian\u0027s grip was harsh. His eyes were dilated and he was gasping. The two wounds in his strong neck were still pumping blood. She growled and strained toward him. His expression was torn, but she was determined. Her mouth found his neck again and they struggled with each other, neither unsure of what exactly was going on. All Amaliya was aware of was her great need to feed and the immense pleasure it sent rippling through her body.\n Cian slid his hand into her hair and let her straddle his body as they slid slightly down the wall. Giving into the eroticism of the moment, their bodies ground together.\n This is almost better than sex, she thought for a moment then felt him cup her breast and rub her hardened nipple. Okay, its better with sex, she amended.\n And then she was lost to all other sensation as he guided her over his hard erection and ground up against her through her skirt. Cupping her face, he pulled her back from his neck again and kissed her deeply, his tongue licking the blood from her teeth and tongue, feeding from her. She gave herself up to him as he feverishly consumed her mouth and her fingers gripped his ass. His mouth traveled over her cheek to her neck where his tongue stroked along her renewed pulse and she slid one hand up into his hair as he swung them around and pinned her to the wall.\n Wrapping her legs around his waist, she gave into him completely as his teeth slid into her throat and she shuddered as the pleasure enveloped her body fully. Her mouth found the wound she had inflicted on his throat again and she began to drink once more as he drank from her.\n Still writhing against each other fully clothed, the vampires fed from each other with overwhelming desire. Amaliya gasped as he grabbed her hands and pushed them over her head.\n Best sex ever, she thought, and struggled against his hard cock inside his jeans.\n Or best almost-sex ever.\n Her tongue slid over the wound on his neck as he rubbed against her, still feeding from her. She felt fully alive once again and the great need was satisfied, but now she wanted him inside of her. Before blood, sex had been her greatest drug and now she craved to be satiated.\n Cian pulled his mouth from her neck and ran his tongue over the wound he had inflicted on her.\n “Please,” she whispered in his ear, and she knew he understood her question.\n Instead, he kissed her deeply and kept rubbing hard against her. His hands slid under her thighs as she wrapped her arms around his neck.\n The phone rang sharply nearby and they both ignored it. The smell of blood and sex was intoxicating. Amaliya ran her tongue in circles around Cian\u0027s, wanting more of him.\n The phone rang again.\n Cian pulled away from her and she buried her face in his neck to lick the last drops of blood from the wounds.\n The phone let out another peal, and then the answering machine clicked on.\n “Hey, Cian! Okay, I just got off the longest phone call in the world with my brother stationed in California. He wants to know if we can visit him. Now, I know its rough with the whole sunlight thing, but he\u0027s going to miss the wedding so maybe we can talk. Okies, love you, baby!” The voice was perky and sweet and Amaliya drew back from Cian. “Talk to you tomorrow” There was a click and the machine turned off.\n A coldness settled between them as the blood lust faded and despite their aroused states, they slid soundlessly from each other\u0027s embrace.\n “Sorry,” Amaliya whispered, after a long embarrassing moment.\n “Not your fault,” he answered, and simply walked away.\n Closing her eyes, she shuddered as she felt her body still craving his touch and his blood. Being a vampire was not going to be easy, especially around her own kind. She slowly slid down to the floor and sat there, deep in thought.\n Cian walked over to the answering machine and hesitated. He could call Samantha back, but he felt too awkward in this moment. Instead, he deleted the message and moved to his desk with all its computer monitors and sat down in the leather chair. He tried hard to ignore his aroused state and the delicious smell of Amaliya in the other room. She had tasted wonderful and he wanted to return to her, throw her down, bite her, fuck her.\n Rubbing his closed eyelids, he tried to remove those thoughts from his mind. It was his fault. He had forgotten how potent it was to feed off another vampire. He had not been among his own kind in so long, his memory was hazy. The last time he had fed off a vampire it had been his long dead lover Rosalinda. It had been wild between them, but she had lived with an insanity that had swept him along and eventually killed her. He had tried hard to forget her and in the process he had forgotten how erotic it was to feel a vampire\u0027s teeth in his throat.\n Leaning back in his chair, he concentrated on Samantha and her sweet smile. He tried to fill his mind with the memory of their first kiss or the first time he had held her close throughout the night. It almost worked, but then Amaliya entered the room behind him, he felt her darkness pulling at him.\n For a moment, he imagined her coming to him and straddling him where he sat in his chair.\n He had completely screwed up in keeping her here.\n “I\u0027m sorry,” she said again.\n He didn\u0027t dare turn around and see her. She was his kind. Her body, her smell, her blood called to him. He would always want her now. He knew it. Without a doubt, he had doomed himself to wanting her.\n “It was my fault,” he answered truthfully, and did not turn around.\n The door opened and Roberto\u0027s soft footfalls echoed down the hall. The two vampires remained just as they were as he entered the room and tossed the bag at Amaliya\u0027s feet.\n “I will retrieve your car now. I thought you may want this to freshen up,” he said in an annoyed tone, then his voice grew soft. “I see.”\n Cian turned and looked at Roberto sharply.\n Roberto looked amused and looked pointedly at Amaliya, then at Cian. “Did I return too quickly?”\n “Go get her car,” Cian said firmly.\n Roberto bowed briefly, with a smirk on his face, and walked out with a much lighter step.\n As the door shut, Amaliya said, “He\u0027s a total bitch.”\n Cian nodded and looked at her again. She was really pretty with her exotic features and long dark hair. He could see with his keen eyesight that her hair was really blond and that she dyed it, but the black hair contrasted nicely with her skin. She had taken off her shoes and stood barefoot on the hardwood floor. She looked unsure of herself and a little afraid.\n “I just don\u0027t sleep with anyone,” she said at last, but her tone wasn\u0027t exactly truthful.\n “Unless they are attractive to you,” he added.\n “Well, yeah.” She blushed and sat on the floor. “I got carried away. I\u0027m sorry.” She curled her legs under her and sat Indian style. “Do you hate me now?”\n “I don\u0027t know you well enough to hate you or like you,” Cian answered honestly. His body was slowly calming down, but he knew it would not take much to arouse him again. He looked away from her and played idly with a framed picture of Samantha.\n “You\u0027re not going to throw me out, are you?”\n “No. No. Of course not. I invited you here.”\n “You kidnapped me,” she reminded him.\n He smiled lightly. “Same thing. Plus, I am the one who offered you my throat. I\u0027m responsible for what happened.”\n “I\u0027m sure I didn\u0027t help,” she mumbled.\n Glancing toward her, Cian took in her pensive expression. He said softly, “No, but again, I invited you here.”\n Those enormous eyes turned up at him and he once more thought her features were quite intriguing. With blond hair they may have faded to bland, but with black, they were intense and lovely \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/pretty-when-she-dies-pretty-when-she-dies-1/page-27.html","bookId":2616,"book":{"id":2616,"title":"Pretty When She Dies (Pretty When She Dies #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Pretty When She Dies (Pretty When She Dies #1) \n Amaliya wakes under the forest floor, disoriented, famished and confused.
