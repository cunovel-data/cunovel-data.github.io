And all those people in the frat house.”\n Amaliya looked at her nails and tried not to look guilty.\n “Look at her! He did this to her. Killed her and left her for dead. She just happened to come back as a...hey, can I see your teeth?”\n “No,” Amaliya said firmly, and shook her head. Sighing, she covered her face with one hand. This was not going the way she expected, but when did thing\u0027s ever go the way she planned? Her luck was notoriously bad. The last few days had proved that over and over again.\n Sergio looked a little hurt by her refusal, but, by the way his body was tensed to flee, it was obvious his fear was the overriding emotion.\n “Here, take this.” Grandmama thrust a wad of cash into her hands. “It will help you. Buy food--um...what you need. And take this.” She grabbed up a cellphone from the counter and unplugged the charger as well. “You buy minutes to put on it with a card and I don\u0027t think the policia can track it.”\n Amaliya took the cash and the phone with a stricken look on her face. “Grandmama, I can\u0027t.”\n “Hey, I gave you that phone,” Sergio protested.\n “I never use it,” Grandmama said, dismissing his comment with a wave of her hand. “Take it, Amal, and call me when you find out something.”\n “Here, keep the money,” Amaliya said. She tried to hand it back to her grandmother, but was quickly rebuffed.\n “Look, nieta, I know that something bad happened to you. I am sad that you aren\u0027t a ghost, because I think we could have fixed this a lot easier. But you are right. You need to go find answers and get this curse taken off of you so you can be at peace.”\n “I don\u0027t know if it can be fixed,” Sergio said softly. “All the movies and the books-”\n “I never watched those movies!” Amaliya shook her head with frustration. “I was terrified of vampires growing up, remember?”\n “Oh, yeah. I remember that Felipe and I scared the crap out of you by wearing big plastic fangs that one time,” Sergio said with a laugh, then saw her expression and stopped. “Sorry.”\n “So you go to Austin and you find a vampiro. Make them tell you everything, and then fix it. And if that doesn\u0027t work, maybe you should go to the Catholic church.”\n “They might stake her.”\n “Would that kill me?” Amaliya looked horrified.\n “A stake through the heart would kill anyone,” Sergio responded.\n “No one stakes no one, okay? So you take my car and you go to Austin and you find a vampiro to help you.” Grandmama shoved her car keys into Amaliya\u0027s hand. “You go find a way to find peace.”\n “I can\u0027t just take your car and your money and go to Austin!”\n “Why not?”\n “It\u0027s not like she did it when she was sixteen,” Sergio muttered under his breath.\n “Hey, I wanted to see Ozzy in concert! And I was stupid. And your brother is the one who talked me into it!”\n “Look, it doesn\u0027t matter. You go and find answers. Then you call me and tell me you are okay.”\n Though they looked quite calm, Amaliya could feel the tension in her family members. They were both watching her like a hawk. She didn\u0027t blame them, not after the things she had done.\n Standing up slowly, she tucked the money into her jeans. Amaliya looked sadly at her tiny grandmother. “I\u0027m sorry I screwed up.”\n “He killed you. And made you into a vampiro. You didn\u0027t ask for that. And, I have hope for you. You\u0027re not killing people left and right and doing bad. You\u0027re good in your heart.” Her grandmother made a step toward her, then hesitated. Seeing the hurt expression in Amaliya\u0027s eyes, she gave up caution and hugged her granddaughter tightly. “You go now. You go and take care of yourself.”\n Amaliya clutched her grandmother to her and relished the soft, warm comforting feel of her little body. Kissing her grandmother\u0027s cheek firmly, she let out a soft sob, then drew back.\n Sergio hesitated, then flung his arms around her and held her close. “Take care of yourself...and don\u0027t bite me.”\n Laughing softly, Amaliya kissed his cheek, then drew back. “I love you, you know. Both of you.”\n Her grandmother was still holding her rosary tightly and Amaliya realized it was glowing around her fingers. It sobered her considerably to see that. She had never considered the condition of her soul or the hereafter before, but, suddenly, she felt afraid.\n “I need my bag,” she said softly.\n “I\u0027ll get it,” Sergio said quickly, and rushed down the hall.\n “Grandmama,” Amaliya whispered softly. “I am trying very hard not to do anything bad.”\n “I know, baby.” Her grandmother was looking down at her rosary. “You always were a good girl, just lost.”\n “I don\u0027t know how I always get into trouble,” she confessed.\n “You don\u0027t think. You just do,” Sergio answered her as he reappeared with her bag.\n “Do not.”\n “Yeah, you do. You never think anything out. We used to have so much fun just suggesting random stuff just to see you go along with it. Amal, let\u0027s go jump off the roof. Amal, let\u0027s go grab the mule\u0027s tail. Amal, go stick your hand in-”\n “Okay, okay,” she said with a pout. “Maybe I\u0027m not too good at the whole plan type thing.”\n “Going to Austin is a good plan,” Sergio said. “Just, you know, don\u0027t just...”\n “Fuck up,” their grandmother said.\n They both started and looked at her in shock.\n “Well, other people screw up. Amaliya fucks up. I\u0027m sorry, but it\u0027s true. She takes after her grandfather. Poor man was a sucker and fell for all the scams in the world. Now, you need to go. You need to get to Austin and find shelter before sunrise.”\n Realizing the late hour, Amaliya knew this was true. Sadly, she kissed her grandmother once more on the cheek, then headed for the back door with her bag in her hand.\n “Call me.”\n “I will. And if the police call-”\n “I never saw you,” her grandmother answered sadly.\n Sergio walked out after Amaliya. His expression was one of worry and he rubbed his chin as she headed to the garage.\n “Amal,” he said softly. He looked back to the window their grandmother was watching them through.\n She turned and looked at him, her hand on the latch that would open the doors.\n “I don\u0027t think this is going to be easy for you. I don\u0027t think there is any turning back.”\n “I know.” She unlatched the door and swung it open revealing the black Lincoln tucked inside. It was from the 1970\u0027s and huge.\n “If you...if you...change...anymore than you have now, don\u0027t come back here.”\n She looked at him, startled.\n “I don\u0027t want you to hurt anyone I love,” he said softly.\n Pressing her lips together tightly, the sting of his words brought instant tears to her eyes. She fought them back knowing she shouldn\u0027t lose anymore of her precious blood. The hunger would come that much sooner.\n “Okay.”\n She opened the second door and walked into the darkness dwelling in the garage. Her vision adapted quickly. She unlocked the driver\u0027s door and swung it open. Tossing her bag in, she looked back at her cousin. His expression was agonized and his posture was tense.\n “I love my family. I won\u0027t do anything to hurt any of you. I\u0027d rather die than do that.”\n “I know, Amal. I know. But all the vampires in the stories always end up...twisted.” He sighed. “I believe in you, but I don\u0027t know what might happen to you.”\n Nodding, she had to agree. She had no clue what would happen next. Silently, she slid into the car and turned it on. The highly-maintained engine caught immediately and purred loudly. Slamming the door shut, she switched gears and slowly backed out.\n Her cousin moved to one side, his expression pained and somber as he watched her. Rolling down the window, she waved to him. He gave her a short wave back.\n Driving down the long driveway to the road, Amaliya took one last look at her grandmother\u0027s house. Chances were, she would never come back and she knew it. Sighing, she turned the wheel, and the car pulled onto the road.\n Tilting his head, The Summoner watched his newest creation speed away in the well-preserved Lincoln. He was impressed so far with her resourcefulness and luck. She hadn\u0027t floundered as badly as some of his offspring had. She was a bit messy and definitely working on instinct, but so far she had survived and not been revealed.\n Returning his gaze to the house her cousin was disappearing into, he considered entering and destroying her support system. But even from where he stood under the peach tree, he could feel the power of the holy relics within. It repulsed him that he could not destroy the tiny old woman and her lumbering grandson, but even he had limits when it came to faith.\n Tucking his hands behind his back, he somberly started off into the darkness.\n Chapter Ten\n Roberto was deep into his research at Cian\u0027s bank of computers, when Samantha appeared next to him, setting down a bag full of groceries on the glass desktop. He quickly minimized the screen. The petite blond was all about saving the environment and carried around the ugliest bags, made from recycled materials, to do her shopping. Setting her hands on her hips, she looked at the computer screen, then back at him as he gazed up at her with a blank expression on his face. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/pretty-when-she-dies-pretty-when-she-dies-1/page-20.html","bookId":2616,"book":{"id":2616,"title":"Pretty When She Dies (Pretty When She Dies #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Pretty When She Dies (Pretty When She Dies #1) \n Amaliya wakes under the forest floor, disoriented, famished and confused.
