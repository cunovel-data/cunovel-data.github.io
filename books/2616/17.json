There were not that many passengers on their way to Abilene, so the bus was relatively empty. Her feet tucked up on the armrest, she was nestled down in her chair, her back against the window, gazing off over her shoulder at the darkened landscape.\n After leaving the motel the night before, she had found her way to another one and settled in for the day. She had picked up a roll of duct tape at a convenience store and used it to tape the curtains shut. Like before, she barricaded the door. She had slept soundly for most of the day.\n Only when her dreams turned dark and disturbing had Amaliya forced herself awake. Sliding off the bed, she had curled up in the corner covered with the comforter, terrified of the sunlight pressing under the crack of the door. She had felt vulnerable and lost. She did not feel safe again until the sunlight slowly faded away and night had come.\n Sliding her fingers through her hair, Amaliya tried not to think of the nightmares. They were more memory than nightmare, and she knew it. In the dream, she had been pressed up against the outside wall of the dorm building. The professor savagely bit and pulled at her throat as she struggled. She had fought him valiantly, but he had kept her pinned easily as her blood flowed in a warm gush over her chest. The pain she had endured and her terror still lingered in her consciousness.\n Rubbing her eyes, she pressed her lips tightly together. Tonight she felt more...human. Tonight her head felt clearer and she felt more connected to the world around her. Maybe it was being in the bus surrounded by other people trying to get home, but she felt more like herself. And she felt more vulnerable.\n The blood lust from the previous night seemed like a dim memory. In fact the whole night seemed like a surreal blur. But it had happened. She remembered every moment with a hazy sort of recollection. And she remembered how much she had enjoyed her last kill of the night. Hell, she remember how much she enjoyed the killings in the dorm back at the college.\n I could kill them all, she thought, looking around at the other passengers. If I wanted to, they would die at my hands and not be able to stop me.\n Finding no solace in that thought, she looked away from the moonlight-drenched trees to the tips of her scuffed boots. Rubbing the side of her nose, she sighed, then started to fiddle with the stud tucked into her nostril.\n Amaliya seriously hated what she had done at the frat house, but she was having trouble feeling guilt. It did bother her that she could be causing the same pain that Professor Sumner had caused her. Yet, she liked the feeling that she could take down someone as huge as Rob and not feel an ounce of remorse.\n “Seriously fucked up,” she muttered.\n The newspaper was tucked under her legs. It had nothing about Rob\u0027s death, but a lot about the slaughter at the campus out East. The rumors of Satanists were getting even wilder. She noted that Professor Sumner was listed as one of the six missing people. She was also classified as missing. The media had printed her driver\u0027s license picture where she was twenty pounds heavier with her natural blond hair. It looked nothing like her. For once her aversion of getting her picture taken seemed to have worked for her.\n As far as she could tell, she wasn\u0027t being searched for as a living person. They thought she was dead. Even her father had said he felt she was dead and gone. Obviously, he was lying through his teeth. She supposed after she tossed him and her brother around, he had figured out she wasn\u0027t alive. The final leap from the house had probably confirmed it.\n The newspaper had a description of her open grave and described her dorm room as being riddled with mud and blood. The police finally had come out and said they believed she had been murdered and that her body had been taken with the killers. They couldn\u0027t explain her empty grave, but they were convinced the Satanists had carted off her dead body.\n What her Grandmama and cousin thought of this, she had no clue. But she had a feeling Sergio was convinced she was running from the Satanists. He had probably reassured her grandmother that she was fine and on her way to see her. Of course, what was really happening was even more absurd. She was a vampire running from her killer and creator.\n Closing her eyes, she listened to the symphony of the wind rushing over the bus, the passengers breathing heavily or snoring as they slept, and the rumble of the bus\u0027 engine. In the old days, before she had been killed, she would have been munching on chips and drinking a diet soda. But she hadn\u0027t had food in days now and drink had little or no appeal to her. She was starting to miss food. The texture, the taste, the satisfaction from consuming something delicious. But food was too easily supplanted by blood now. It was warm, thick liquid that tasted divine as it filled her and renewed her. The memory of the taste of food was beginning to fade from her. It made her sad.\n The sound of the air brakes stirred her from her reverie. She looked up to see the station coming into view as the bus slowed down. With remarkable ease and talent, the bus driver maneuvered the lumbering vehicle up into the station in Eastland. As the lights came on and the brakes whooshed, people stirred awake and began to move.\n Amaliya grabbed up her bag and headed down the narrow aisle as fast as she could before she ended up at the end of the line. She easily beat out everyone disembarking. The bus driver sat silently in his chair rubbing his eyes as the passengers departed. She wondered briefly what it felt like to be tired. She didn\u0027t feel physically tired anymore.\n As she came down the high steps, she caught sight of her very tall cousin. Whereas her mother and Mae had married men of good old German and Polish stock, the third sister, Sergio\u0027s mom Susan, had married Ruben Guerra. Sergio was tall, stockily built, with dark skin and curly black hair, but with striking Germanic facial features and green eyes. He stood looking very solemn, with his arms folded over his chest, until he saw her, then he smiled with relief.\n Rushing to him, she knew he would sweep her up and hug her. And he did, crushing her tight, and kissing her cheek. She held tight to him for several seconds, then drew back, trying not to cry her blood tears.\n “You okay?” he asked softly, and grabbed up her bag.\n “Yeah, I am now.”\n “You\u0027re dead, you know,” he whispered. He slung his arm over her shoulder and guided her toward his big Ford truck.\n “I saw that in the paper,” Amaliya confessed.\n “Gawdawful picture of you,” Sergio mused. “Which I guess is a good thing. No one has recognized you?”\n She shook her head and was relieved when he unlocked the truck and opened the door. “Does Grandmama know?”\n “No, no. I kept her entertained all evening making an enormous feast for us. I even lied and told her Cynthia and the munchkins might join us,” Sergio said, referring to his wife and children. “Anything to keep her away from the TV until the late shows come on.” He slammed the door shut once she was inside, cutting the conversation short. He walked around the truck and climbed in on the other side. Starting it up, he said in a low voice, “What happened?”\n Amaliya rubbed her face and shook her head. “I don\u0027t want to talk about it. I\u0027ll just tell Grandmama that I have to go away for awhile and not go into details.”\n “Something really bad happened to you,” Sergio said in a grim voice. He was just a year or two older than her, but his maturity pressed down on her. He had a dad vibe that she didn\u0027t know how to take. “I think I deserve to know what.”\n Shrugging slightly, she looked out the window, then decided to tell him the abbreviated truth. “I was attacked. And the person who did it buried me in the forest and I got out.”\n “Shit,” Sergio exclaimed in shock. “Shit! You were buried alive?”\n “I went back to the dorm room, packed and left,” she continued, leaving a whole huge chunk of the truth out. Like the fact that she was really dead.\n “Does your Dad know?”\n “I went straight to him to ask him for the truck so I could just disappear for awhile. So, yeah, he knows,” she sighed.\n “He didn\u0027t give you the truck, huh?”\n “Nope. Aunt Mae had to get her two cents in.”\n Sergio shook his head and turned out onto the highway. “I thought it was bad enough when I heard that Pete Talbert had a heart attack, but this beats all.”\n Amaliya quirked an eyebrow. “Pete had a heart attack?”\n “Yep. They found him in a hotel room. He was pretty close to death, but he\u0027s okay now. At least they think it was a heart attack. Who knows.” Sergio drove with his arm propped up on the edge of the window, his strong fingers gripping the wheel tightly. “They called Felipe to let him know since they were old buddies since we were all kids. I remember how bad a crush Pete had on you. We used to tease him about it all the time whenever we visited ya\u0027ll out there.”\n Amaliya sighed guiltily. “I didn\u0027t know.”\n “Enough about Pete. Who the hell attacked you? Did you see them?”\n Amaliya thought of the Professor and his charming smile. “Yeah. But I don\u0027t want to talk about it.”\n “Amal, seriously, you gotta go to the police. I know you\u0027re scared and just want to run away, but you gotta-” \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/pretty-when-she-dies-pretty-when-she-dies-1/page-17.html","bookId":2616,"book":{"id":2616,"title":"Pretty When She Dies (Pretty When She Dies #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Pretty When She Dies (Pretty When She Dies #1) \n Amaliya wakes under the forest floor, disoriented, famished and confused.
