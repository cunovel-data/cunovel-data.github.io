His last name is different. It\u0027s Lynch.”\n “Lynch is the English variation of ó Loinsigh,” Jeff answered.\n “Oh, shit! You know my boyfriend!”\n “My father knew him. They made a pact back in the day that still stands to this day.” Jeff sighed softly. “But if another vampire is in town and Cian isn\u0027t taking care of it, there is a problem.”\n “Did I just get my boyfriend in trouble?”\n “If there is another vampire in town, we may all be in trouble.”\n With the casual elegance he was known for, and actually quite proud of, Roberto laid out all the tools he would need for his impromptu excursion. Industrial strength trash bags, twist ties, a bag full of garbage, an extra large garbage container, duct tape, several rolls of black plastic tarp, and the keys to the Lexus RX. Taking a hold of the ladder he had purchased that morning at WalMart, he set it before the nearest window and decided to start there.\n It took almost an hour to cover the windows with the black plastic, sealing it into place with the duct tape. By the time he had finished, the area around the chamber was dark and no sunlight crept in anywhere near it. Satisfied that Cian would be safe, Roberto popped the panel and entered the code.\n The wall slipped open with a soft whisper and it took a moment for his eyes to adjust to the absolute darkness that enshrouded the vampires. Slowly they took form in the murk and he could see that Cian was holding Amaliya close to him. He was not surprised. He had seen his master steadily falling under the influence of her presence.\n That was why he had to do this.\n Removing her from Cian\u0027s arms would be a little difficult, but he knew the vampires would sleep through it all. And thankfully, Cian\u0027s blood infusions made Roberto strong despite still being basically human. Being a human servant to a vampire did have its advantages.\n He leaned over and began to steadily apply pressure to Cian\u0027s arms. He projected what little power he had toward the vampire. He knew that his master would sense his presence and not be threatened. Slowly, Cian\u0027s arms came apart from around the woman and Roberto maneuvered his Master\u0027s sleeping body into a more comfortable sleeping repose on his back.\n Taking a deep breath and steeling himself inwardly, Roberto reached for Amaliya. As he had known they would, her eyes flashed open and her lips parted. It was a survival instinct and he knew she was still fully asleep. To protect her as she slept, her body took on an even more sexual and voluptuous look in order to bespell whoever was disturbing her sleep. He had to admit that she was alluring in her own way. If she wasn\u0027t such a damn disruption, he would have possibly entertained the thought of seducing her.\n He so did enjoy seducing beautiful, exotic women.\n Using what little vampire power he had inherited from Cian\u0027s blood, he ignored her seductive aura and pulled her toward him. Her clothes were stiff with dried blood, but her skin was pale and beautiful. Over the last few nights, he had seen her fully coming into her new vampire nature.\n Which was all the more reason for her to go.\n Picking her up, he found her surprisingly heavy. He carried her over to the tarp on the floor and lay her down, then returned to close the chamber. The wall descended, sealing off Cian, and Roberto felt a sense of relief that his master was too weak to awaken during the daylight hours.\n Disturbed by her open eyes and the way they trailed after him, he leaned down and closed them with his fingertips. They immediately reopened. Frowning, he grabbed a heavy bag and slid it over her head and down to her hips. Then, he yanked another bag over her legs and began to wrap the duct tape around her securely.\n Cian would be upset. He knew that. But his Master was blinded by the lust he felt for the new vampire and the feelings she drew out of him. It was not as if Roberto was particularly fond of Samantha. He found her too cute and too chirpy to suit him. Just as Amaliya drew out the darker aspects of Cian\u0027s personality, Samantha drew out Cian\u0027s human side. Roberto found both women annoying. Cian had been best when Roberto had been his only companion. He had been strong, sure, and merciful when need be.\n Roberto wasn\u0027t sure if he could get rid of Samantha without Cian\u0027s wrath, but he could get rid of Amaliya.\n Setting the over-sized trash can down, he studied the wrapped up form of the vampire and then made his choice. He picked her up and just dumped her in and began to shove and twist until she fit snuggly at the bottom.\n As the second son of a rich Spanish landowner in Mexico nearly a hundred years before, he had been ignored in favor of his brother. It had been made clear to him very early in life that he was expected to find his own way while his brother would inherit everything. Roberto had responded to this by becoming a bit of a con artist and a womanizer. By sixteen he was cast out and on his own.\n That had suited him just fine. He had rich taste and found ways to ensure a good life for himself. In his late thirties, he was rich, well-established, and living on his own hacienda in Mexico. Then he had seen torches in the distance on his land one night. He had rode out to inspect what was going on and found men torturing a man they had tied to a tree with silver chains. Angered that they were lynching anyone on his land, Roberto had shot and killed the four men without pause. It was when he had gone to untie the man they were torturing, that he realized the man had blazing red eyes and sharp fangs.\n “Release me and I will not hurt you,” Cian had hissed.\n Roberto had hesitated, then said, “What are my assurances of this?”\n “None. It\u0027s a gamble. I\u0027ll take their blood, not yours. And if you give me shelter, I will make sure you are richly rewarded.”\n Roberto was never one to shy away from a gamble.\n Now, here he was: rich, the companion of a power man, practically immortal, and protecting Cian as he had that night.\n Picking up Amaliya\u0027s bag, he shoved it down next to her. He pushed a full garbage bag down on top of her and opened up the top. He pulled the sides of the bag down firmly over the lip of the trash can and secured it with a little bit of duct tape. Once done, he put the lid on, then took it off again and peered in. It looked just like any other trash can. No one would ever guess that a bound vampire was at the bottom of it.\n Replacing the top and snapping it closed, with the handles that locked into place to hold the top shut, he smiled with satisfaction. Not certain of how long it would take for him to get back, he took the plastic and duct tape off the windows and rolled it up into another trash bag. Within an hour, the apartment looked just as it had and Amaliya was tucked away in the trashcan.\n Cian needed him to protect him and that was exactly what he would do. That was his role in Cian\u0027s life and he would not let his master be the fool.\n As for Samantha, perhaps Cian\u0027s true nature had awoken enough for him to send her away. Though, Roberto would miss sparring with her.\n Oh, well.\n Picking up the car keys, he grabbed hold of the handle and pulled the trashcan so it would pivot on the wheels at its base. With a small, smug smile, he pulled the trash can out after him and locked the apartment door.\n Chapter Seventeen\n Jeff stood up and motioned to Samantha to follow him. He needed to pack up and grab something to eat before heading back to the store. The lecture had gone well enough, but the turn of events had him uneasy. His father had long held the line when it came to the supernaturals in Austin, keeping things relatively calm and under control. The last big threat had been the vampire cabal that his father and the other hunters had wiped out in the late Seventies. And they would never have been able to do that without Cian.\n “I don\u0027t understand how you know about Cian,” Samantha said in a low voice. Her eyes were huge with disbelief.\n “My Dad knew him really well before he died.” Jeff began packing up his slide projector. It was old and worn out, but it had been his father\u0027s. He could easily use a laptop for this sort of thing, but he had a problem letting go of the past. Well, letting go of his father.\n “How?”\n “My father was a vampire hunter.”\n “For real?”\n “Yeah. And so am I.”\n “You\u0027re not staking Cian,” Samantha said firmly. “Okay?”\n Jeff hesitated, then rolled up a cord slowly. “Did Cian make the new vampire?”\n “No. But his creator did. I heard that much. Theo Sumner made her.”\n “The Summoner?”\n “Yeah, him.”\n “Shit.” Jeff shook his head. “And she found her way to Cian?”\n “I think he picked her up in a bar,” Samantha answered with a sigh.\n “And this is your boyfriend?”\n “Actually, we’re engaged’.”\n “Cian is getting married to a mortal?” Jeff raised both his eyebrows in disbelief.\n “Yeah. So? He loves me!” She gave him a petulant look and crossed her arms defiantly over her breasts.\n “Okay, just tell me what you know.” \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/pretty-when-she-dies-pretty-when-she-dies-1/page-38.html","bookId":2616,"book":{"id":2616,"title":"Pretty When She Dies (Pretty When She Dies #1)","description":"Storyline: \n Pretty When She Dies (Pretty When She Dies #1) \n Amaliya wakes under the forest floor, disoriented, famished and confused.
