As curious as he was about Cotton, he was much too busy these days to play detective, for, although he was pretty certain of winning the cross-country race from Broadwood, Gerald wasn’t taking any chances, and the way he and Andy Ryan kept the team on the go was a caution. The race was to be held, as usual, on the morning of the day of the football game between the rivals, and over a course which might be called neutral, lying as it did practically halfway between the two schools. Broadwood Academy was situated some four miles from Yardley on the other side of Greenburg and so far inland that at Yardley they spoke of it humorously as a “freshwater college.” Broadwood was slightly smaller than Yardley in point of enrollment, but for all of that was an ideal rival, since she fought hard[124] in every competition and obligingly went down in defeat oftener than she triumphed. There was no student now in Yardley who could recall a Broadwood victory on the gridiron, although there had been some heart-breaking struggles and alarmingly close scores. In baseball Broadwood was not so obliging, although since John Payson’s advent at Yardley she had experienced more defeats than victories. The rivalry between the two preparatory institutions, both good ones, was healthy. Yardley fellows simulated a contempt for the wearers of the Green that they really didn’t feel, and Broadwood pretended similar sentiments toward the Blue. In reality, however, each school entertained a deep-seated respect for the other. While Yardley graduates were likely to go up to Yale to complete their education, Broadwood traditions favored Princeton. But while Broadwood usually excelled at hockey, garnered a full share of the track and field honors, proved herself as good as her rival at baseball, and accepted defeat on the gridiron only after the gamest battles, she was weak at cross-country running and had been beaten each of the few times that she had met Yardley. Gerald, who would have liked to complete his hill-and-dale career and celebrate his year as captain[125] with a hard-fought victory, lamented Broadwood’s weakness this year. “I wish we might give them a handicap,” he confided to Harry that Saturday morning as they went back to the gymnasium after a two-mile jaunt. It was the day of the Forest Hill game, and partly because it seemed fair to let the cross-country runners witness the afternoon contest and partly because it was advisable to accustom the team to morning work, since the race was to be run in the forenoon, to-day’s work had started at ten-thirty. Gerald seemed as fresh as when he had started out, and save for the disks of red which had not yet faded from his cheeks, one would never have suspected that he had led nine others over approximately two miles of the hardest sort of going. Harry Merrow, however, showed the pace. He had managed to finish fourth and was rather proud of himself, although when Gerald had clapped him on the back at the finish and congratulated him he had only smiled depreciatingly. “We might give them a quarter-mile start,” proposed Harry, with a laugh, in response to Gerald’s remark. “But I don’t see why you’re so anxious to get beaten, Gerald.” “I’m not, but I’d like to have the race a really close one. As it is, we’re just as likely as not to[126] finish the first four men ahead of them. I’m pretty certain we will if you run as well as you did to-day.” “I ought to do three or four minutes better on the eighteenth,” said Harry. “How far behind you was I to-day?” “About six minutes. And I did as well within three minutes as I ever did,” said Gerald. Harry thought that over for a minute as they climbed the footpath that affords a short cut to the gymnasium from the village road, and before he had succeeded in figuring out what their relative positions would probably be in the race Gerald introduced a change of subject. “How do you think the campaign is going, Harry?” he asked. “Campaign? Oh, you mean Kendall’s. Why, pretty well, I think. But I hear that there’s a good deal of talk of making Crandall captain. He’s pretty popular, you know. And a good player, too.” “That so? I hadn’t heard it. Well, Howard’s a fine chap, and if our candidate loses he ought to make a good captain. Have you heard talk of any other fellows for captain?” “No, I guess not. Fales would take it if he could get it. So would two or three others. Pete Girard, for one.” [127] “He’d be a wonder,” laughed Gerald. “No, I guess it will be up to either Howard Crandall or Kendall. You haven’t heard Kendall’s name mentioned, have you?” “For the captaincy? No, but I don’t hear much of the talk. But Kendall has certainly made good so far, hasn’t he? I mean with the fellows. They all seem to like him. If he’d get busy and pull off some brilliant stunt this afternoon or next week, or win the Broadwood game with a field-goal, I guess he could have the captaincy, eh?” “I think so. Unfortunately, we can’t advise him to get off any gallery plays. He wouldn’t if we did. Besides, a fellow can’t make opportunities. All he can do is to grab them when they come. I hope, though, that Kendall will put up a good game to-day. It’s time the fellows began to consider him as a possibility. If they don’t we’ll have to drop a hint pretty soon.” “You’re a regular old politician,” laughed Harry. “Say diplomat,” said Gerald. “It sounds more respectable.” “Schemer is more like it,” responded Harry, as they entered the gymnasium. “Something tells me that a shower is going to feel mighty good.” [128] Half an hour later, when they rounded the front of Oxford, the Golf Team was just setting off for Broadwood, after an early dinner, in a three-seated carriage. George Kirk waved to them and then spoke to the driver, and the carriage stopped. Kirk leaned out and called to Gerald. “Say, Gerald, do something for me? Find The Duke; he’s at the telephone, I think, and tell him never mind about New York; I’ll call up this evening.” “Never mind about New York, you’ll call up this evening. All right, George; I’ll tell him. Good luck! Go to it and eat ’em alive!” Kirk nodded and waved, and the carriage went on down the drive. “I suppose,” mused Harry as he followed Gerald back to Oxford, “that Kirk is just as much excited about his old golf match as you and I will be about the race two weeks from now. Funny, isn’t it?” “Funny?” repeated Gerald as he ran up the steps. “Why?” “Oh, funny to think it matters who wins a golf match!” “It’s evident you’re not a golfer,” laughed Gerald. “I’ll bet that if George’s outfit gets licked this afternoon he will be like a bear[129] with a sore head! There’s The Duke in the booth.” The long-distance booth was halfway down the main corridor of Oxford, and, although it was rather dim, they could descry a figure behind the glass. It was dinner hour and Oxford was otherwise quite deserted. Gerald walked down the corridor, Harry sauntering behind. “Hi, Duke! Kirk says never mind about New York!” shouted Gerald. The Duke looked very angry and red-faced behind the window as Gerald drew near, and was gesticulating wildly. He was also saying things, but what they were Gerald was still too far away to hear. “The Duke’s having a fit, Harry,” he announced interestedly. “Come and watch him.” “... Door ... lemme out....” “What’s he saying?” asked Harry grinning as he realized The Duke’s dilemma. Gerald shook his head. “Can’t understand him. Can you? Seems quite worked up about something, though.” “Lemme out! Don’t be a fool! Can’t you see this blamed door’s stuck?” And The Duke mouthed and grimaced behind the glass. Gerald and Harry, maintaining a respectful distance, viewed him gravely. [130] “Can’t get his number, I suppose,” said Harry sympathetically. “Maybe he’s got hold of a live wire somehow. Anything wrong, Duke?” “You open this door, Gerald! I’m suffocating in here!” “He wants you to open the door,” explained Harry brightly. “But do you think you’d better? He looks a bit dangerous, doesn’t he?” “Y-yes,” responded Gerald doubtfully. “Perhaps we’d better have help in case he gets——” But there was such a rattling of the door, such an assault on the side of the booth that Gerald’s words were drowned. “I do hope he’s hung up the receiver so that the operator can’t hear him,” said Harry. “It might give the school a bad name.” Gerald, at last taking pity on the prisoner, turned the door knob and The Duke stumbled out, angry of countenance and incoherent of speech. “Wish you’d get yourself locked up in that blamed thing,” he sputtered, “and see how you like it! It’s ninety-eight in there, and you can’t breathe! Why didn’t you open that door before? Wanted to be smart, I suppose?” “What’s the matter with the door?” asked Harry. [131] “It’s crazy, I guess. You can’t open it from inside to save your life. It ought to be fixed.” “Oh, I guess you didn’t go at it right,” said Harry soothingly. “Let me try it.” So Harry stepped into the booth and closed the door behind him, The Duke’s expression of wrath changing slowly to a wicked grin. Harry turned the knob inside and pushed. The door remained firm. Then he tried again and with no better success. The Duke was thoroughly enjoying himself now, applauding and encouraging. Gerald observed smilingly. At last Harry gave it up. “Can’t be did,” he announced from within in a smothered voice. “Open her up, Gerald.” Gerald looked inquiringly at The Duke and The Duke gazed questioningly at Gerald. “Strange,” observed the latter, “that you can’t hear what he says. Perhaps if he put his mouth to the keyhole——” “There isn’t any,” said The Duke. “That’s so.” Gerald shook his head sadly. “I don’t see what he can do then.” Harry threatened them behind the glass. “You open that door, you silly chumps! I want my dinner.” “Did you get that?” asked The Duke. Gerald shook his head. “Only a faint murmur.[132] These sound-proof booths are wonderful, aren’t they?” “Marvelous! Who’d ever suppose that a person could be as near as that and not be heard?” Harry was now doing his best to kick a hole through the wooden paneling, his expression an interesting mixture of amusement and annoyance. “Listen!” said The Duke. “I think I hear a tapping!” “He is probably trying to signal to us, the way they do in the mines, you know, when they’re imprisoned.” “I know. They let food down to them through pipes somehow, don’t they? I wonder if we could get his dinner to him anyway? We might telephone it, perhaps.” “If you don’t open this door,” announced Harry desperately, “I’ll break the glass and you fellows will have to pay for it. Fair warning!” “I hear a little better now,” said The Duke. “Perhaps he wants to come out, Gerald!” “I wonder! How stupid of us! I’ll bet that’s it, Duke. Suppose we open the door and see.” “Silly asses!” grunted Harry as he emerged, warm and disgusted. “It makes an awful difference who the joke is on, doesn’t it, dearie?” asked The Duke sweetly. [133] “Somebody ought to tell someone about that,” said Harry, “and have it fixed.” “And someone had better get into commons before someone loses someone’s dinner,” replied The Duke. “You fellows been in?” “No, we were on the way when Kirk asked us to find you and give you a message.” “He was in a rush and asked me to call up his folks in New York and say he’d telephone this evening. Couldn’t get the house, though. Central said they didn’t answer. I wonder if he knew about that door!” “I don’t think so,” laughed Gerald as they ran up the steps of Whitson. “He didn’t look to be in a very—very flippant mood.” After dinner the three boys went up to Gerald’s room and loafed until it was time to go to the game. They reached the field early, but found the grand stand already nearly filled. Forest Hill School had sent over nearly a half hundred rooters and these had taken possession of one end of the stand and were already tuning up for the afternoon’s vocal performance. A good many folks had come over from Greenburg and, of course, Yardley had turned out to a man. The crowds was still streaming on to the field when the Forest Hill team trotted past the corner of the stand and crossed the gridiron to throw off[134] blankets along the further side-line. Gerald, Harry and The Duke were idling by the ropes on the Yardley side when “Perky” Davis, the football manager, stopped. Davis was a thin, light-haired youth with an habitual expression of care and concern. Just now he seemed more worried than ever, and the creases on his forehead were many and deep. “Look who’s here, Gerald,” he said in a low voice. Gerald’s gaze followed the manager’s toward the grand stand. “Who, Perky?” he asked. “Gibson, of Broadwood; the fellow who substitutes at guard. See him? The big chap with the light gray overcoat and the derby hat, sitting next to the Forest Hill crowd. He’s here to spy on us. Probably thinks we won’t recognize him. I wish he’d choke. We were going to use four or five new plays to-day, too. I’ll have to tell Payson.” “I remember him,” said The Duke. “He’s got his nerve, hasn’t he? I think he sees us looking at him.” “Let him,” muttered Davis. “It’s just like Broadwood to send spies over here.” “Seen any more?” asked Gerald. Davis shook his head, searching the throng suspiciously.[135] “Not yet. Maybe he’s the only one. They wouldn’t send more than one, I guess. He isn’t much of a player, but they say he’s a mighty clever chap at sizing up things.” “Well, I suppose they have a right to do it if they want to,” said Gerald. “And we can’t very well put him out, can we?” “No, but he won’t learn much, because when I tell Payson he will shut down on any new stuff. It’s too bad, though, because we need to try out those plays.” At that moment the Yardley team came on and the Yardley cheerers started into action. “We’d better find some seats or there won’t be any,” suggested Harry. “Wait a minute,” said Gerald. Davis had hurried away and was speaking to the coach. When he turned back Gerald hailed him. “What did Payson say, Perky?” “Asked me if I was certain, and I said I was. Then he nodded and called Charlie and Bert. I guess they’re making over the programme.” At a little distance Payson, Merriwell and Simms were in consultation. The rest of the team had taken the field and the footballs were already flying through the air. “Someone ought to kick him out,” said Harry, fixing the Broadwood youth with hostile regard. [136] “We might kidnap him,” suggested The Duke dreamily. “Anyone got a gunny-sack handy? We could tie him up in it and drop him into the Bosphorus—I mean the Wissining.” “What we should have done,” said Davis, “is to have sent someone to watch Broadwood play Nordham to-day. If it’s fair for them it’s fair for us.” “It’s extremely low-bridge,” replied The Duke disapprovingly. “Quite reprehensible, whatever that may be. Also, fellows, if anything should happen to him he’d have only himself to thank.” “What’s going to happen to him?” asked Gerald, eyeing The Duke with suspicion. The Duke only smiled carelessly. “Why ask me? I don’t say anything is going to happen. I only say if anything should happen——” “Oh,” murmured Davis disappointedly, “I thought perhaps you had a plan to get rid of him.” The Duke viewed him reprovingly. “Perky, if you want anyone put out of the way you must do it yourself. I refuse to stain my hands with the life blood of even a Broadwood fellow. I’m that particular!” “Well, I hope he enjoys himself,” muttered the manager. “He won’t learn much, anyway.”[137] He nodded and hurried off, drawing his note-book and pencil into sight. The Duke quietly beckoned Gerald and Harry toward the entrance. Outside the three stood for several minutes with their heads together. When they ambled carelessly back their countenances were as innocent of guile as the faces of three babies. Only there was a suspicious twinkle in The Duke’s eyes. The grand stand being filled, the three found a space on the grass near the rope and watched the two teams take their positions. It was a clear, nippy Fall day, with a brisk northwest breeze quartering across the field and streamers of white clouds scudding by overhead. Forest Hill had won the toss and chosen the north goal. The whistle blew and Fales kicked off.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3280/89777.html","bookId":497,"book":{"id":497,"title":"Around the End","description":"简介： Coach Payson sent the call to each end of the field and then, swinging his small blue megaphone in his hand, waited for the panting players to gather about him in front of the bench.
