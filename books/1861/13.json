{"id":81885,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"Micha \"Dude, where the fuck is your head today?\" Ethan asks and seconds later a grease rag hits me in the face. I throw it back at him, hard. \"You\u0027re starting to piss me off with this crap.\" Ethan widens his eyes exaggeratedly. \"Whatever man. You\u0027ve been so distracted for the last two days.\" He sticks his head back under the hood. \"And I\u0027m not going to say why.\" \"Good, because I don\u0027t want to hear it.\" I round the back of my car and eye over the tools on the wall of the garage. I grab a rusty toolbox, one of the few things my dad left behind, and toss it into the garbage can. He called again this morning, begging on the answering machine for either my mom or I to pick up. Ethan raises his head up and eyes the garbage can. \"Wanna explain what that was for?\" \"Nope.\" I pick up a wrench and start working on the car. We work on it for a while, but it\u0027s hot and I\u0027m getting more pissed off at my dad by the second. Finally, I move back and throw the wrench down onto the concrete. Ethan doesn\u0027t ask questions this time. \"We should have a party tonight,\" I announce, unable to hold still. \"A big one, like the one we had on graduation night.\" \"You really want to relive that night?\" Ethan backs out from under the hood. \"Because I\u0027m not sure I do.\" I step outside into the sunlight, determined to get my mind off stuff. \"What you can\u0027t remember doesn\u0027t hurt, right?\" \"I don\u0027t think you want to go there.\" Ethan walks next to me and we stare down the driveway at an old guy pushing a shopping cart. \"There are plenty of times in my life I wish I could remember - that I\u0027d give anything to remember - but I can\u0027t. I lost like a year of my life. It\u0027s better to stay within the boundaries of a semi-clear head. Besides, this doesn\u0027t sound like you at all. What\u0027s up?\" \"Nothing\u0027s up.\" I sigh, raking my fingers through my hair. \"I\u0027m just thinking out loud.\" Ethan returns to the garage and starts working on the engine again. Around sophomore year, he started hanging out with these kids at school, who had really heavy views on the world and liked to sit around and get high while they talked about it. Ethan somehow ended up being friends with them, and within a month, he had dropped out of school and got into some pretty heavy shit. A year later he made the decision to get some help. He cleaned up his life, cut the habits, and worked the hell out of himself to catch up in school. He was a grade behind, but managed to graduate with our year. Looking at him, you wouldn\u0027t guess. The side door of Ella\u0027s house swings open and Lila steps out. She looks upset, although not as bad as she did last night. She glances up the driveway at the house across the street, where there\u0027s a very loud game of tackle football going on in the front yard. Her eyes roam to my house and then widen when she sees that I\u0027m watching her. She gives a tentative wave from the top step. \"Hey, Micha.\" \"What\u0027s up?\" I say with a nod of my chin. \"Is Ella up yet?\" Shielding her blue eyes from the sun, she looks up at Ella\u0027s window. \"Yeah, she said she\u0027d be out in a second. She\u0027s just talking to her brother.\" \"He\u0027s not being a dick, is he?\" \"I\u0027m not sure what constitutes as a brother being a dick, since I don\u0027t have one.\" A smile cracks at her lips. I walk toward the fence, pulling up my jeans that are riding low on my hips. \"There\u0027s no yelling going on?\" Lila shakes her head and meets me at the fence, plucking some of her blonde hair away from her mouth. \"But Ella\u0027s not much of a yeller, is she?\" I rest my arms on the top of the fence. \"It depends on which one we\u0027re talking about.\" Her face falls. \"How could I know her for eight freaking months and not know anything about her. It must say something about me, right?\" I feel bad for her. \"I think Ella kind of made it her mission to keep who she was hidden from you. It\u0027s not your fault.\" She eyes me over with this suspicious look. \"Honestly, it seems like she\u0027s that way with everyone, except for you.\" \"We\u0027ve known each other forever,\" I say. \"We have a comfortable relationship.\" Her blue eyes twinkle with mischievousness. \"One where you feel her up in the car?\" \"It feels like you\u0027re trying to start some trouble,\" I say, liking the girl even more. \"Maybe I am.\" She leans over the fence to the side of me so she can get a better view of the inside of the garage. \"Is that Ethan in there?\" I step back so she can get a better look. \"Yep, he\u0027s working on the car.\" \"I think I\u0027ll go give him some help.\" A grin spans across her face and she hops over the fence, squealing as her shoe gets caught in the wire. Trying not to laugh at her, I unhook her shoe and she walks into the garage, surprising Ethan. The door to Ella\u0027s house opens and my attention centers on her as she steps out into the sunlight. She\u0027s wearing a tight, black and purple plaid dress, and knee high lace-up boots, but her hair is curled up neatly. It\u0027s like a mix of her old look and her new one. Her face is guarded as she ambles across the driveway, with this strange look in her eyes, like she\u0027s terrified yet excited at the same time. \"Did Lila come out here?\" She bites her lip and I want to lean over and bite it for her; taste her and feel her like I did last night. Without taking my eyes off her, I nod my head at the garage. \"She\u0027s in there with Ethan. I think she might have a thing for him.\" \"I think you\u0027re right.\" She pauses. \"I think I might have freaked her out a little, just barely.\" \"You mean you and Dean might have freaked her out a little?\" \"She told you I was talking to Dean?\" \"She mentioned it.\" I extend my hand to her. \"Why don\u0027t you come over and join the party on this side of the fence?\" \"A party of four?\" she asks, trying not to grin and looking as cute as hell. I snag her by the hip, jerk her toward me playfully, and dip my lips to her ear. \"It can be a party of two. Just say the word.\" She shivers from the feel of my breath on her neck. \"I think we better keep it a foursome.\" I press my fingers into the curve of her hips. \"I didn\u0027t know you liked it kinky.\" She swats my shoulder and I laugh, my dad problems feeling less heavy. \"Relax, I was just kidding, even though you\u0027re the one who brought it up first.\" \"I was joking.\" \"I know... I think I am going to have a party tonight.\" \"Don\u0027t you have one of those every night?\" I cock my eyebrow. \"Besides the night you showed up, have you seen one going on?\" She wrinkles her forehead. \"No.\" She sits down on the fence, swinging her legs over to my side. \"Micha, what have you been doing for the last eight months?\" \"Pinning for you.\" I avoid the truth. That I haven\u0027t been doing much of anything besides looking for her and helping my mom take care of things. She tucks her dress underneath her legs and I get a small glimpse of the black lacy panties she has on. \"Where do you work?\" Against her protest, I spread her legs apart and put myself between them. \"I work at the shop with Ethan a lot, but it\u0027s not going to be forever. I have plans. I\u0027m still working on getting everything lined up.\" She places her hands on my chest, holding me back. \"I think the lines between our friendship are getting a little blurred.\" \"That happened a long time ago,\" I tell her, gliding my palms up the sides of her bare legs. \"At least for me it did.\" Her jaw tightens. \"It\u0027s things like that which make them blurry and things last night... and things like in the car.\" \"There seems to be a lot of things, which I think might be a hint that you and I belong together.\" Her eyes snap wide and I back off to try another tactic. She needs to smile and let those stressed lips free. I pinch her side and she squeals. \"Don\u0027t do that,\" she says, holding back a laugh. \"You know I hate being tickled.\" I graze my fingers across her other side and she squirms, before falling over the fence and landing on her back in the grass. I leap over the fence easily as she scrambles to her feet. She narrows her eyes, backing toward her back door. I run up to the side of her and she skitters out of my reach. She glances at the door and then at the front yard, which is closer to her. \"Micha, seriously,\" she warns. \"We\u0027re too old for this.\" I spread my arms out to the side innocently. \"I\u0027m not doing anything.\" Her eyes flick to her house one last time and then shaking her head, she spins around and runs for the front yard. I give her a head start before I sprint off after her. When I round the house, she\u0027s up on the front porch, jiggling the door knob. I laugh at her. \"Is it locked?\" She heaves a frustrated sigh and hops over the railing, slipping on the grass. \"Dammit Micha! I\u0027m so going to kick your ass for this.\" \"I\u0027m planning on holding you to that threat.\" I jog after her across the neighbor\u0027s yard. She races across the grass, her hair falling out of a clip. She leaps over the brick fence into the next yard and smashes a row of flowers. Without using my hands, I hop onto the fence, but trip during my dismount and fall on my knees. She freezes in the middle of the lawn and starts to laugh at me. \"You so deserved that.\" I get to my feet, dusting the dirt off my knees, and a dark smile rises on my face. \"You think that\u0027s funny?\" Her eyes sparkle and it\u0027s worth the fall. \"You look ridiculous.\" \"Do I?\" I take a step toward her. She takes a step back. \"You do.\" Abruptly the sprinklers turn on, drenching the grass and her. She screams and covers her head with her arms. \"Serves you right for laughing at me,\" I say with a grin. She lets her arms fall to the side and smirks. \"Well, at least it keeps you away from me.\" Her dress is clinging to her body in all the right places and pieces of her wet hair stick to the sides of her face. She begins to twirl in circles with her hands up above her head. \"You\u0027re beautiful,\" I say, unable to help myself. Ella Micha looks ridiculous and I can\u0027t help but laugh. I haven\u0027t laughed in so long that it feels unnatural leaving my mouth. It\u0027s like we\u0027re kids again, as if this moment belongs in another time where things are weightless and full of sunshine. As I\u0027m laughing at him, the sprinklers turn on and my clothes instantly get soaked. At first I squeal, but then I let go, lifting my hands above my head and twirling in the water, figuring he won\u0027t come in after me. He calls out something about me being beautiful and then he charges into the sprinklers, completely blind-siding me. His arms snake around my waist and we collapse to the ground but Micha holds my weight up, so I land on the wet grass gently. \"Micha,\" I say, trying to be serious. \"Don\u0027t do it. You know how much I hate being tickled.\" \"Which makes it even more appealing.\" Water beads in his hair, his long eyelashes, his lips. With one hand, he pins my arms above my head and presses his body against mine. My wet clothes cling to my skin and I can feel every part of him. \"I take that back. This is more appealing.\" He lets his hand move up my ribs, his thumb sketching along the ridges, sending my body into a frenzy. I stop fighting him and lay perfectly still. Water sprinkles our faces as he lowers his lips to mine. Our wet tongues twine together, full of desire as they collide. A strange, unfamiliar feeling opens inside of me again and my legs fall apart and hook around his waist, requesting more of him, like they did last night. Micha draws back, looking surprised as he glances at the house to the side of us and then at the street. Then he lets out an untamed growl and deepens the kiss, thrusting his tongue deep into my mouth. I suck on his bottom lip and trace my tongue along his lip ring. It sends a quiver through his body and I\u0027m secretly pleased, but my pleasure confuses me. \"Ella,\" he groans and then kisses me fiercely. His hand travels upward and cups my breasts. His thumb circles around my nipple and through the wet fabric of my clothes, the feeling is mind blowing. It\u0027s driving me wild and my knees vice-grip against his hips. A moan laced with ecstasy crumbles from my lips. I\u0027m starting to lose control again and it\u0027s alarming. I try to get past it this time, but it consumes me and I have to stop. After a lot of effort, I get my arms between our bodies and I push him away. \"We should get back.\" I look at the brick home of the yard we\u0027re laying in. \"Besides if Miss Fenerly comes out, she\u0027ll have a heart attack.\" Micha\u0027s aqua eyes penetrate me. There\u0027s mud on his forehead and grass in the locks of his blonde hair. \"If that\u0027s what you want.\" Maneuvering to his feet, he takes my hand and lifts me to mine. He plucks pieces of grass out of my hair and lets his hand linger on my cheek. Holding hands, we walk across the grass and down the sidewalk, leaving a trail of water behind us and something else. Something invisible to the outside eye, but to me it\u0027s more noticeable than the sun in the sky.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-secret-of-ella-and-micha-the-secret-1/page-13.html","bookId":1861,"book":{"id":1861,"title":"The Secret of Ella and Micha (The Secret #1)","description":"Storyline: A rule-breaker with a fiery attitude, Ella always wore her heart on her sleeve.
