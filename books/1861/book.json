Then she left everything behind to go to college, where she transformed into someone who follows the rules, keeps everything together, and hides all her problems. Now it\u0027s summer break and she has nowhere else to go but home. But once there, Ella fears that everything she\u0027s worked so hard to bury might resurface-especially with Micha living right next door. Smart, sexy, and confident, Micha can get under Ella\u0027s skin like no one else. He knows everything about her, including her darkest secrets. If he tries to tempt the old Ella to return, he will be impossible to resist. But what Ella doesn\u0027t realize is that when she left, she took a piece of Micha\u0027s heart with her. Now he\u0027s determined to win back the girl he lost, no matter what it takes.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-secret-of-ella-and-micha-the-secret-1.jpg","author":"Jessica Sorensen","type":"Young Adult","link":"http://www.cunovel.com/books/","chapterCount":26,"category":{"id":9,"name":"Young Adult","creation":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM","modification":"Feb 15, 2020 2:34:16 PM"}}
