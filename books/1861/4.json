{"id":81876,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"Ella\\n\\n \"I take it that\u0027s Micha?\" Lila wanders around my kitchen as she tightens a loose ribbon on the waist of her floral dress. \"He\u0027s even cuter than in the picture.\"\\n\\n \"Yep, that would be Micha.\" I kick a box across the stained linoleum floor and flip the light on. It looks the same; seventies themed colors, wicker chairs around the glass table, and yellow and brown countertops.\\n\\n \"So just your dad lives here?\" Lila circles the small kitchen and her gaze lingers on the countertop next to the kitchen sink where empty bottles are lining the wall.\\n\\n \"Yeah. My older brother moved out as soon as he graduated.\" I adjust the handle of my bag and head for the stairway. The house smells like rotten food and smoke. In the living room, the aged plaid sofa is vacant, and the ash tray on the coffee table is spilling over with cigarette butts. The television is on so I shut it off.\\n\\n \"So where\u0027s your dad?\" Lila wonders as we climb up the stairs.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not sure,\" I avoid the truth, because he\u0027s probably at the bar.\\n\\n \"Okay, where\u0027s your mom?\" she probes. \"You never told me where she lives.\"\\n\\n Lila doesn\u0027t know much about me and it\u0027s how I want it. Leaving her in the dark, about my mom, my brother - everyone in this aspect of my life - has allowed me to transform into someone who doesn\u0027t have to deal with my problems.\\n\\n \"My dad works nights,\" I make up a story. \"And my mom moved out quite a while ago. She lives up on Cherry hill.\"\\n\\n She leans forward to study a portrait of my mother displayed on the wall; the same auburn hair, pale skin, and green eyes as me. Her smile was just as fake as mine, too. \"Is this your mom?\" She asks and I nod. \"She looks just like you.\"\\n\\n My chest tightens and I quickly trot to the top of the stairway. At the end of the hall, the bathroom door is wide open. The corner of the porcelain tub and the stain on the tile floor is in my line of vision. My heart constricts tighter as the memories flood me. I\u0027m suffocating with panic.\\n\\n \"Baby girl,\" she said. \"I\u0027m going to go take a nap, just for a little while. I\u0027ll be back in just a bit.\"\\n\\n My knees tremble as I shut the door. My chest opens up and oxygen flows through my lungs again.\\n\\n \"So where does your brother live?\" Lila peers inside my brother\u0027s room full of drums, guitar picks, CDs, and records. There\u0027s a bunch of band posters taped to the wall and a guitar up on a mount.\\n\\n \"I think in Chicago.\"\\n\\n \"You think?\"\\n\\n I shrug. \"We don\u0027t have the best relationship.\\n\\n She nods, like she understands. \"So is he in a band?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not sure if he\u0027s still in one now. I\u0027m guessing since his stuff\u0027s here, probably not,\" I say. \"He only played because he was friends with Micha and he\u0027s in a band. Or was. I have no idea what he does anymore.\"\\n\\n \"Ella, did you lose touch with everyone in your life?\" Lila accuses, tucking the pillow under her arm.\\n\\n Her scrutiny makes me uncomfortable. Avoiding confrontation, I turn on my bedroom light and shudder at the sight. It\u0027s like a museum of my past. Sheets of my artwork are tacked to the walls, trimmed with a black skeleton border Micha put up when we were twelve to make my room more \"manly.\" A collection of guitar picks line the far dresser and there is a pile of my boots in the corner. My bed is made with the same purple comforter and there\u0027s a plate with a half-eaten cookie on it, which is growing mold.\\n\\n I toss the cookie into the trash. Hasn\u0027t my dad been in here since I left?\\n\\n Lila picks up a guitar and plops down on the bed. \"I didn\u0027t know you played.\" She positions the guitar on her lap and strums the strings. \"I always wanted to learn how to play, but my mom would never let me take lessons. You should teach me.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t play.\" I drop my bag on the floor. \"That\u0027s Micha\u0027s guitar. His initials are on the back.\"\\n\\n She turns it over and looks at the initials. \"So the hot guy from next door is also a musician. God, I\u0027m about to swoon.\"\\n\\n \"No swooning over anyone in this neighborhood,\" I advise. \"And since when are you into musicians? I have never, until today, heard you say anything about liking guys who can play the guitar.\"\\n\\n \"Since they look like him.\" She points over her shoulder toward Micha\u0027s house, which is visible through the window of my room. \"That boy is dripping with sexiness.\"\\n\\n Jealousy growls in my chest and I mentally whisper for it to shut up. I pick up a photo of my mom and me at the zoo when I was six. We\u0027re happy, smiling, and the sun is bright against our squinting eyes. It rips at my heart and I let the photo fall back onto the desk. \"There\u0027s a trundle under the bed that you can sleep on if you want.\"\\n\\n \"Sounds good.\" She slides the guitar off her lap and goes over to the window, drawing the curtain back. \"Maybe we should go to the party. It looks kind of fun.\"\\n\\n I gather my hair away from my eyes before dragging the trundle out from under the bed. \"No offense, Lila, but I don\u0027t think you can handle one of Micha\u0027s parties. Things can get a little bit crazy.\"\\n\\n She narrows her eyes at me, insulted. \"I can handle parties. It\u0027s you that never wanted to go to any of them. And the one\u0027s that I did talk you into going to, you just stood in the corner, drinking water and sulking.\"\\n\\n I flop down on the bed with my arms and legs slack over the edges. \"That party is nothing like a college frat party. They\u0027re the kind of parties you wake up from the next day on a park bench with no shoes on and a tattoo on your back, with no recollection of what happened the night before.\"\\n\\n \"Oh my God, is that how you got that tattoo on your back - the one you refuse to tell me what it means.\" She lies on the bed next to me and we stare at the Chevelle poster on my ceiling.\\n\\n \"It means infinite.\" I tug the hem of my tank top down, hiding the tattoo on my lower back, and drape my arm over my forehead. \"And I don\u0027t refuse to talk about it. I just can\u0027t remember how I got it.\"\\n\\n She gives me a sad, puppy dog face and bats her eyelashes. \"Pretty please, with a cherry on top. This might be my only chance to go to a party like this. The ones at my old neighborhood consist of limos, fancy dresses and tuxes, and a lot of champagne.\" When I don\u0027t respond, she adds, \"You owe me.\"\\n\\n \"How do you figure?\"\\n\\n \"For giving you a ride here.\"\\n\\n \"Please don\u0027t make me go down there,\" I plead, clasping my hands together. \"Please.\"\\n\\n She rolls onto her stomach and props up on her elbows. \"He\u0027s an old boyfriend, isn\u0027t he? You were lying. I knew it. No one can draw a picture like that of someone they\u0027ve never loved.\"\\n\\n \"Micha and I have never dated.\" I insist with a heavy sigh. \"If you really want to go see what these parties are all about, I\u0027ll take you down there, but I\u0027m not hanging around for more than five minutes.\" I give in because deep down I\u0027m curious to check up on the world I left behind.\\n\\n She claps her hands animatedly and squeals, looking out the window one last time. \"Holy crap. Someone\u0027s standing on the roof.\"\\n\\n They say curiosity killed the cat. \"Come on, party girl. Let\u0027s get this over with.\"\\n\\n About fifteen years ago, this town used to be a decent place to live. Then the factory that supplied jobs to almost the entire town shut down. People were laid off and slowly it began to dwindle into the bottomless pit that it is now. The houses across the street are painted in graffiti and I\u0027m pretty sure my next door neighbor makes moonshine in his garage, or at least he did before I left.\\n\\n Inside Micha\u0027s house, there are people loitering in the entryway. I push my way through them and into the kitchen, which is crammed with even more people. On the table is a kegger and enough bottles of alcohol to open a liquor store. The atmosphere is overflowing with the scent of sweat and there are a few girls dancing on the kitchen counters. People are making out in the corners of the living room where the sofas are shoved to the side, so the band can flare on their instruments, screaming lyrics of pain and misunderstanding at the top of their lungs. I\u0027m surprised Micha isn\u0027t up there playing.\\n\\n \"Holy crap. This is...\" Lila\u0027s blue eyes are round as she gawks at the people jumping up and down in the living room, shaking their bodies and thrashing their heads.\\n\\n \"Like a mosh pit,\" I finish for her, shoving a short girl with bleached hair out of my way.\\n\\n \"Hey,\" the girl whines as her drink spills down the front of her leather dress. \"You did that on purpose.\"\\n\\n For a split second, I forget who I am and turn around to blast her with a death glare. But then I remember that I\u0027m the calm and rational Ella; one that doesn\u0027t get into fights and beat other girls up.\\n\\n \"What, preppy girl?\" She pats her chest, ready to throw down. \"You think you scare me.\"\\n\\n Lila bites her thumbnail. \"We\u0027re sorry. She didn\u0027t mean to.\"\\n\\n Chants fill the living room and the chaos is giving me a headache. \"Sorry,\" I strain an apology and squeeze between her and the wall.\\n\\n She snickers at me and her friends join in with her laughter as they sashay to the back door. It takes everything I have not to turn around and tackle her to the floor.\\n\\n Lila makes a beeline for the bar set up on the counter, dumps a drop of vodka into a cup, and mixes it with a splash of orange juice. \"Okay, that was intense. I thought she was going to kick your ass.\"\\n\\n \"Welcome to Star Grove.\" I shout over the music. \"The Land of the Intense and Poverty-stricken, where the adolescents roam free without sober parental supervision and try to start fights wherever they can.\"\\n\\n She laughs, takes a gulp of her drink, and her face pinches at the bitterness. \"Try - \" She starts, then coughs. She pounds her hand against her chest.\\n\\n \"Are you going to make it?\" I ask. Lila has never been a big drinker.\\n\\n She nods and clears her throat. \"I was going to say try growing up where you have to get permission to wear a certain style of shoes.\" I give her a mystified look and she adds, \"If it wasn\u0027t up to my mother\u0027s stylish fashion standards I wasn\u0027t allowed to wear it.\"\\n\\n I edge out of the way of a guy with blotchy skin and a beanie covering his head, who doesn\u0027t seem to mind that he knocks his shoulder into mine. \"I\u0027m sure it wasn\u0027t that bad growing up where you did. I mean, at least there was some control.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, there was,\" she says uneasily and her eyes quickly scan the room. \"I can\u0027t believe there\u0027s a live band. It\u0027s like being at an outside concert.\"\\n\\n \"What? They don\u0027t have live bands in California?\" I joke with a small smile as I pour myself a cup of water. \"One\u0027s that take place outside?\"\\n\\n She stirs her drink with a straw. \"Not these kinds of bands. Think much more mellow, with a stage and seats to watch.\"\\n\\n \"Sounds like fun to me.\" I oblige a smile and glance at my watch. \"Are you about ready to go?\"\\n\\n \"Are you joking?\" Sucking the drink out of the straw, she hops on the counter and crosses her legs. \"We just got here. Why would we want to go? In fact, we should go dance.\"\\n\\n My eyes find the living room, where a guy with dreads smashes his head against the glass plate of a cabinet in the corner and everyone cheers.\\n\\n \"You can if you want, but I\u0027m good.\" I gulp my water. \"I like all my bones intact.\"\\n\\n Leaning against the counter, I scan through the crowd, curious to see where Micha is. I don\u0027t know why I\u0027m so curious, but I am. Occasionally he would bail on his own parties, either to hook up or just get some quiet. I found him a couple of times hiding out on a lawn chair. Each time, he would pull me onto his lap and we would stare up at the night sky, talking about an unreachable future.\\n\\n I spot him in the corner, sitting on the couch with his arm draped around some blonde girl with boobs popping out of her dress. His hair hangs in his eyes and he\u0027s nibbling at his lip ring, driving the girl crazy I\u0027m sure. They\u0027re just talking, but the girl keeps flipping her hair off her shoulder and her hand is on his chest. It\u0027s hard to tell if Micha\u0027s enjoying her company or not. He was always difficult to read when it came to girls because he never really looked interested in any of them, but sometimes he would end up with them for the night.\\n\\n I asked him about it once and he said it was all fun, but that he was just killing time until I gave into my inner desire to be with him. I tackled him to the ground for it and it made him laugh.\\n\\n \"Why do you have that look on your face? Like you\u0027re undressing someone with your eyes?\" Lila asks, following my gaze. \"Oh, is that - \"\\n\\n My eyes dart from Micha. \"I wasn\u0027t looking at anyone, just the madness in the living room.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, right,\" she says, elevating her eyebrows. \"You totally want him. I can see it on your face.\"\\n\\n \"Well, I\u0027ll be damned if it isn\u0027t the infamous Ella May!\" Ethan Gregory grins from the other side of the counter, just behind Lila. He stumbles around the corner, nearly clipping his head on the low ceiling. Before I can respond, he has me trapped in an awkward hug with his long arms that are tracked with tattoos. His grey shirt smells like an ash tray and his breath like beer. He pulls back, ruffling his black hair with his fingers. \"Does Micha know you\u0027re here in his house?\"\\n\\n I lie breezily, very aware of where Micha is and what he\u0027s doing. \"I\u0027m pretty sure he saw me walk in.\"\\n\\n \"I doubt that. He\u0027s been looking for you for the past eight months.\" He glances over his shoulder and nods at Lila, then tips in toward me. \"You know he\u0027s been a wreck ever since you took off. You really fucked up his head, Ella.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s such a lie,\" I tell him. Ethan and I have never really gotten along very well, which is why the hug confused me so much. We both had the same blunt attitude and butted heads a lot. The only reason we were friends at all was because of Micha. Although, there was one time we did bond for a split second, but we never talk about it. \"Micha doesn\u0027t fall apart over anyone. I know him better than that.\"\\n\\n His face is flushed and his brown eyes are bloodshot. \"I guess you don\u0027t know him as well as you think then, because he\u0027s been a wreck. In fact, all he\u0027s done for the last few months is search for you.\"\\n\\n \"Which explains the party,\" I retort. \"I\u0027m guessing that classifies as that.\"\\n\\n \"First one in five months,\" he says. \"And I think he only did it because he found out where you were and needed a distraction.\"\\n\\n \"I know him better than you do, Ethan, and he doesn\u0027t fall apart over girls,\" I say, but cringe at the fact that I might not know him anymore. A lot can happen in eight months. \"Hey, Lila, we should go. It\u0027s getting late.\"\\n\\n She glances at her diamond encrusted Rolex and rolls her eyes. \"It\u0027s like nine thirty.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re leaving already?\" He waves his hand in the air. \"That\u0027s nonsense talk right there. You haven\u0027t even seen Micha yet and he\u0027s gonna be super pissed if he misses seeing you, especially since you ran away from him in the driveway.\"\\n\\n \"Actually, I think we\u0027re going to hang out for a little while longer,\" Lila presses with unrelenting eyes. She mouths, he\u0027s hot. Then she fastens her hands together. Please, Ella. Pretty please.\\n\\n Ethan isn\u0027t Lila\u0027s type. He\u0027s got baggage almost as heavy as mine. I start to protest when Micha\u0027s deep voice floats over my shoulder and tickles my skin like feathers. Without being able to help it, I let out a soft moan.\\n\\n \"Yeah, pretty girl, stay a little longer.\" He\u0027s so close that the heat of his body kisses my skin and my insides tremor. His fingers comb through my hair as he whispers, \"You smell so good. God I\u0027ve missed your smell.\"\\n\\n \"I have to get up really early in the morning.\" I clear my throat and Lila\u0027s eyebrows furrow. \"I need to go home and get some sleep.\"\\n\\n He places his hand on the counter, so the crook of his arm is touching my hip. \"You can keep trying to avoid me,\" he breathes in my ear, taking a nip at my earlobe. \"But sooner or later you\u0027re going to have to talk to me.\" His breath reeks of beer and his clothes of smoke.\\n\\n Refusing to crack at the sound of his sexy voice, I turn and face him. \"I don\u0027t have time to get drunk and act like a moron.\"\\n\\n He\u0027s even more gorgeous under the light and more irresistible, even though his eyes are glossed over. \"It\u0027s your fault I\u0027m drunk - you drive me crazy.\" He descends his voice to a soft purr, the same voice he\u0027s used on me many times to get what he wants - the voice that makes me feel alive inside. \"Baby, come on. Please. We need to talk.\" He leans in to kiss me.\\n\\n The suddenness throws me off balance and I trip over my own feet. \"Micha, stop it.\" I gently push him back and he staggers into the edge of the counter. \"You\u0027re drunk. And I\u0027m going home.\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027s acting weird... like she\u0027s way too calm,\" Ethan remarks, with a wave of his finger. \"And she\u0027s dressed funny, like that girl we use to go to school with. What\u0027s her name?\" He snaps his fingers. \"Stacy.... Stacy...\"\\n\\n \"Harris,\" I say exhausted. \"And I look like a girl that went away to college and grew up.\"\\n\\n Lila slants forward. \"Ella\u0027s been this way since I\u0027ve known her, but I\u0027m really curious what she used to look like with the way everyone keeps talking about her because I can\u0027t picture her any other way besides this.\"\\n\\n Micha and Ethan trade drunken looks and then howl with laughter. The room quiets down a little as people glance in our direction.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s so funny?\" Lila frowns and looks to me for help. \"I\u0027m so lost.\"\\n\\n \"Nothing. They just think they\u0027re funny.\" I dodge around Micha, but he seizes my elbow and hauls me back against his chest. \"Hey relax, baby.\" He kisses my forehead and gives me his innocent face. \"Please don\u0027t go. I just got you back.\"\\n\\n Before I took off, the boundaries of our friendship were starting to blur. I thought time would fix this, but it seems like we\u0027re back to where we started. As much as I would love to melt into him, it just can\u0027t happen. I can\u0027t open up like that and lose control. I need control.\\n\\n \"No one\u0027s got me back. I\u0027m just here for summer break and only because I didn\u0027t have money to rent an apartment,\" I say and his expression falls. \"The Ella you knew is gone. She died on that bridge eight months ago.\"\\n\\n He blinks, as shocked as I am. His lips part then he clasps them shut, struck speechless.\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t mean that,\" I say quickly. \"I\u0027m sorry, Micha. I just can\u0027t deal with this.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t be sorry for being real,\" he says, rubbing his forehead with the back of his hand.\\n\\n I force the lump in my throat down. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" I say again, and then weave through the crowd and out the back door, inhaling the fresh air.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s your problem?\" Lila asks as she catches up with me at the edge of my driveway. She squashes her plastic cup and tosses it into the trash can on the back porch. \"I\u0027m so confused. What just happened?\"\\n\\n \"I needed to get out of there before I lost it.\" I don\u0027t slow down until I\u0027m in my room where I close the door and shut the window, locking away the world. I sigh back against the wall, breathing in the quiet.\\n\\n Lila watches me with inquisitiveness as she pulls her hair back into a bun and puts some lip gloss on. \"Ethan and Micha act like you used to be someone else. Like this isn\u0027t the real you. Want to explain?\"\\n\\n \"Not really.\" I push away from the door and collect some pajamas from the duffel bag. \"I\u0027m going to go take a shower. Do you need anything from downstairs?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, for you to tell me why those guys have you so frazzled.\" She unclips her watch and tosses it into her purse that\u0027s on the bed. \"I\u0027ve never seen you so worked up like that. You basically had an orgasm when you first saw him.\"\\n\\n \"I did not,\" I say, embarrassed and annoyed. \"And you haven\u0027t seen me that worked up because I\u0027m not that person anymore.\"\\n\\n \"Except for when you\u0027re around him,\" she insinuates. \"When you were talking to him, there was something in your eyes I\u0027ve never seen before. You were always so closed off to all the guys at parties and in school. Honestly, I thought you were a virgin. But the way you and Micha were looking at each other - you\u0027ve had sex with him, right?\"\\n\\n Pressing my lips together, I tuck my pajamas under my arm, and shake my head. \"No, Micha and I\u0027ve never slept together, just like we\u0027ve never dated. But we\u0027ve been friends since we were kids.\"\\n\\n She sits down on the bed and unhooks her sandal. \"But you\u0027ve had sex before?\"\\n\\n I squirm in my skin. \"I\u0027m going to go get ready for bed.\"\\n\\n \"Whoa, wait a second.\" She leaps off the bed wearing one shoe and jumps in front of the door with her hands spread out to the side. \"Are you saying that you\u0027ve never had sex? Ever.\"\\n\\n I struggle for words she\u0027ll understand. \"It\u0027s not like I haven\u0027t because I don\u0027t believe in premarital sex or anything. I just... Look there\u0027s a lot you don\u0027t know about me and sometimes I have a hard time getting close to people.\"\\n\\n She\u0027s not surprised. \"Well, obviously. That\u0027s totally been a given from day one.\"\\n\\n \"What do you mean?\" I question. \"I\u0027ve never told anyone that before.\" Not even Micha.\\n\\n \"It means sometimes I can see right through you.\" She sighs and counts down on her fingers. \"I\u0027ve been your roommate for eight months and all I know about you is you\u0027re focused on school, you hate to drink, hate being around large crowds, and have never went on a date. I barely know you and being here, I\u0027m starting to wonder if I know you at all.\"\\n\\n She knows the Ella I want her to know. \"Can you let me by? I\u0027m really tired.\"\\n\\n She gives me a disbelieving look, but doesn\u0027t press. She steps aside and lets me by. Relief washes over me because I don\u0027t want to get into it with her. Not tonight. Not ever. I never want to get into the night that changed my life. I buried my reckless identity, and I won\u0027t dig it up again. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-secret-of-ella-and-micha-the-secret-1/page-4.html","bookId":1861,"book":{"id":1861,"title":"The Secret of Ella and Micha (The Secret #1)","description":"Storyline: A rule-breaker with a fiery attitude, Ella always wore her heart on her sleeve.
