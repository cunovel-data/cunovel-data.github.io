{"id":81883,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"\\n\\n Ella\\n\\n I can remember the first time I wanted to kiss Micha as clearly as the day I found my mother dead. Both times were equally as terrifying, but in two different ways.\\n\\n Micha and I had been sitting on the hood of his car at our secret spot tucked away in the trees, staring out at the lake. It was harder than hell to get back to the spot, but the view and serenity made it worth it.\\n\\n It had been quiet between the two of us for a while, which was normal except for the jealousy stirring inside me over Micha\u0027s latest hook up, Cassandra. I\u0027d never felt this way before and it puzzled me. It wasn\u0027t like the girl was anything special to Micha, but he\u0027d told Ethan that she had the potential to be girlfriend material and it was bugging me.\\n\\n Micha\u0027s arms were tucked under his head and his eyes were shut as the sunlight beamed down on him. His shirt had ridden up and I could see his tattoo peeking out. As I stared at it the urge to run my fingers along it drove me crazy.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t like Cassandra,\" I abruptly sputtered out, sitting up quickly.\\n\\n Micha\u0027s eyebrows knitted as his eyes gradually opened against the sunlight. \"Huh?\"\\n\\n \"That Cassandra girl you were talking about the other day,\" I said, staring out at the water rippling in the gentle breeze. \"I don\u0027t think you should date her.\"\\n\\n He rose up on his elbows. \"Because you don\u0027t like her?\"\\n\\n \"No...\" I tucked strands of my auburn hair out of my eyes. \"I just don\u0027t want you to date her.\"\\n\\n The wind filled the silence. Micha sat up and wrapped an arm around my shoulder.\\n\\n \"Okay, I won\u0027t,\" he said as if it was as simple as breathing.\\n\\n I pressed back a smile, not fully understanding why the hell I was so happy. Micha lay back down and drew me with him. I rested my head on his chest and listened to his heart beating, steady as a rock, unlike mine which was dancing inside my chest.\\n\\n The longer I stayed in his arms, the more content I became. I felt safe, like nothing could hurt me, but I was in complete denial that I was starting to fall in love with my best friend.\\n\\n It\u0027s been a week since the car racing incident and I\u0027ve been hiding out in my bedroom living on mac n\u0027 cheese and Diet Dr. Pepper. Dean still hasn\u0027t headed home, but Lila did the morning after the race. She wanted to stay, but I didn\u0027t want her to and I think her dad wasn\u0027t too keen on the idea either.\\n\\n It\u0027s been kind of lonely, though.\\n\\n I still haven\u0027t listened to Micha\u0027s voicemail, and the constant flashing on the screen torments me. I decide to take a break from the house today and do something I\u0027ve been meaning to do for a while. I want to sketch my mother\u0027s grave because I won\u0027t always be close enough to visit it. It\u0027s been bothering me the entire eight months that I\u0027ve been gone. I feel guilty because it was me who put her there and then I just left her.\\n\\n I collect my sketch book and pencils from the drawer of my night stand, slip on my shoes and sunglasses, and head out the front door where I\u0027m less likely to run into Micha. It\u0027s a warm day and the blue sky glitters with sunshine. I walk up the sidewalk toward Cherry Hill and decide to make a last minute stop at Grady\u0027s.\\n\\n I knock on the trailer door and Amy, the nurse, answers it wearing blue scrubs. \"Oh, hi Ella, I don\u0027t think Grady\u0027s up for any visitors today, sweetie.\"\\n\\n \"But he told me to stop by,\" I say stupidly. \"I know it\u0027s a little later than I told him and I\u0027m sorry.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s not mad at you, Ella,\" she says kindly. \"I\u0027ve just got him hooked up on oxygen and he\u0027s got a cough.\"\\n\\n I shield my eyes from the sun and stare up at her. \"Is he okay?\"\\n\\n She sighs, leaning against the doorframe. \"He\u0027s just having a rough day today, but try back in a few days, okay hun.\"\\n\\n I nod and back down the steps as she shuts the door. I stare helplessly at the back window which leads to Grady\u0027s room. He\u0027s sick and there\u0027s nothing I can do. I have no control over this. Micha was right. I can\u0027t control everything.\\n\\n As horrid images of my mom\u0027s death flash through my mind, I run into the field and throw up.\\n\\n The town\u0027s cemetery is located up on Cherry Hill, which on foot is quite a hike, but I enjoy the break from the reality of life. There is no one up there - there hardly ever is. I push through the gate and situate by a tree right in front of my mom\u0027s headstone. It\u0027s a small cemetery bordered by trees and the grass is covered with dry leaves.\\n\\n As I sketch the lines of the fence and the vines that coil it, I angle downward and draw the curve of her tombstone. I become lost in the movements, adding wings to the side of it, because she was always so fascinated with flying.\\n\\n A few weeks before her death, my mother begged me to go on a walk with her. I gave in even though I had plans that day. It was sunny and the air smelled like cut grass. It felt like nothing could go wrong.\\n\\n She wanted to go to the bridge so we walked all the way across town to the lake. When we arrived there, she climbed on the railing and spread her hands out to balance as her long auburn hair flapped in the wind.\\n\\n \"Mom, what are you doing?\" I said, reaching for the back of her shirt to pull her down.\\n\\n She sidestepped down the railing out of my reach and stared at the water below. \"Ella May, I think I can fly.\"\\n\\n \"Mom, stop it and get down,\" I said, not taking her very seriously at first.\\n\\n But when she turned her head and looked at me, I could see in her eyes that she wasn\u0027t joking. She really believed she could fly.\\n\\n I tried to stay as composed as possible. \"Mom, please get down. You\u0027re scaring me.\"\\n\\n She shook her head and her legs wobbled a little. \"It\u0027s okay honey. I\u0027ll be fine. I can feel it in my body that I can fly.\"\\n\\n I took a cautious step toward her and my foot bumped the curb of the bridge. The cement rubbed my toe raw and I could feel blood oozing out, but I didn\u0027t look down at it. I was too afraid to take my eyes off her. \"Mom, you can\u0027t fly. People can\u0027t fly.\"\\n\\n \"Then maybe I\u0027m a bird,\" she said seriously. \"Maybe I have wings and feathers and they can carry me away and I can become one with the wind.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re not a bird!\" I shouted and reached for her again, but she hopped onto one of the beams and laughed like it was a game. I tugged my fingers through my hair and steadied onto the railing. It was a far fall, one that would crush our bodies on impact, even in the water. I braced my hands on the beams above my head. \"Mom, if you love me at all, you\u0027ll get down.\"\\n\\n She shook her head. \"No, I\u0027m going to fly today.\"\\n\\n A truck rolled up and stopped on the middle of the bridge as I edged toward her. Ethan jumped out and didn\u0027t so much as flinch at the scenario. \"Hey, Mrs. Daniels. How\u0027s it going?\"\\n\\n I gaped at him and hissed, \"What are you doing?\"\\n\\n He ignored me. \"You know it\u0027s not really safe out there.\"\\n\\n My mom angled her head to the side. \"I think I\u0027ll be okay. My wings will carry me away.\"\\n\\n I was mortified, but Ethan didn\u0027t miss a beat. He rested his arms on the railing. \"As much as that could be true, what if it\u0027s not? Then what? I mean is it really worth the risk?\"\\n\\n I glanced back at my mom and she looked like she was weighing the options. She stared at the dark water below her feet and then at the bright sky above her head. \"Maybe I should think about it for a little bit.\"\\n\\n Ethan nodded. \"I think that\u0027s probably a good idea.\"\\n\\n She made a path across the beam and planted her feet on the railing. Ethan helped her down and we got her into the backseat of his truck. She fell asleep within minutes and I slumped my head back against the chair.\\n\\n \"How did you do that?\" I asked quietly.\\n\\n \"One of my friends was tripping out of their mind one night and I had to talk him out of jumping off the roof,\" he explained. \"It was all about making her realize that there was more than one scenario.\"\\n\\n I nodded and we stayed quiet for the rest of the drive to my house. Ethan never brought it up to me, nor did he treat me differently and I was grateful for it.\\n\\n After a doctor\u0027s visit, it was determined that my mother had started to suffer from \u0027Delusions of Grandeur,\u0027 which happens sometimes in bipolar patients.\\n\\n I finally pull away from the drawing when it\u0027s nearly dark. I gather my sketchpad and pencils and head down the hill. In front of the arch iron entryway is Micha, sitting on the hood of his mom\u0027s car, wearing jeans, and a black and red plaid shirt. His head is tipped down and wisps of his blonde hair cover his forehead as he messes around with his phone.\\n\\n I stop a little ways off from him. \"What are you doing here?\"\\n\\n His eyes lift from his phone. \"I\u0027m waiting for you.\"\\n\\n \"How did you know I was here?\"\\n\\n \"I saw you leave with your sketchpad and head this way, so I came up to check on you.\"\\n\\n I take a tentative step forward. \"How long have you been sitting here?\"\\n\\n He slides off the hood and puts his phone away. \"For a while, but I didn\u0027t want to disturb you. You looked too peaceful.\"\\n\\n I press my lips together and stare at him, craving to sketch him like I used to. He would sit on my bed and it was like he owned my hand. \"Look, about the other night, I think - \"\\n\\n He strides across the grass toward me, moving so impulsively that there\u0027s no time to react as his finger covers my lips. \"Just let it be for a while, okay?\"\\n\\n Uncertain of his exact meaning, I nod anyway.\\n\\n He lets his finger fall from my lips, trailing a line down my chest, finally pulling away at the bottom of my stomach. \"You want a ride home?\" His voice comes out ragged.\\n\\n I glance at the grey sky and the birds flying across it. \"That would be nice. Thank you.\"\\n\\n Micha\\n\\n She\u0027s preoccupied during the drive and so am I. I was so pissed off about my father that I got into the car about to do something reckless, however, then I saw Ella wandering down the street, and I followed her. The way she walked was very entertaining, her auburn hair blowing in the wind, and the way she swayed her ass in the short denim shorts she was wearing. It calmed me down watching her sit up on the hill and draw, but I can\u0027t stop thinking about the phone conversation.\\n\\n \"We should go somewhere,\" I announce when we drive onto the main road.\\n\\n Ella jolts in her seat and turns away from the window. \"I should probably go home.\"\\n\\n \"Come on.\" I pout, hoping it\u0027ll win her over. \"Just come with me somewhere and we can relax.\"\\n\\n She\u0027s tempted. \"Where exactly?\"\\n\\n I turn the volume of the stereo down and let my arm rest on the top of the steering wheel. \"To our spot by the lake.\"\\n\\n \"But it takes forever to get there.\" Her eyes rise to the dark sky. \"And it\u0027s getting late.\"\\n\\n \"Since when have you been afraid of the dark?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not the dark I\u0027m afraid of.\"\\n\\n I sigh and downshift. \"Come on, just you and me. We don\u0027t even have to talk. We can just sit in silence.\"\\n\\n \"Fine,\" she surrenders, tossing her sketchpad into the backseat. \"Just as long as you don\u0027t ask me questions.\"\\n\\n I hold up my hand innocently. \"Scouts honor. I\u0027ll keep my questions to myself.\"\\n\\n Her eyes narrow. \"I know you\u0027ve never been in the scouts before.\"\\n\\n I laugh, feeling the pressure lift from my chest. \"It doesn\u0027t matter. I\u0027ll keep my questions to myself, but with everything else, all bets are off.\"\\n\\n She pretends to have an itch on her nose, but really it\u0027s to obscure her smile and it makes me smile myself.\\n\\n Its pitch black by the time we reach our spot on the shore that\u0027s secluded by tall trees. The moon reflects against the water and the night air is a little chilly. I get my jacket out of the trunk and offer it to Ella, knowing she\u0027s cold because of the goosebumps on her arms and the way her nipples are poking through her shirt.\\n\\n She slips the jacket on and zips it up, covering up her perky nipples. I sigh, hop onto the hood, and open my arms for her to join me. Hesitantly, she climbs onto the hood, but stays at the front, with her feet propped up on the bumper, gazing out at the water.\\n\\n I scoot down by her and keep my knees up, resting my elbows on them. \"What are you thinking about?\"\\n\\n Her eyes are huge in the moonlight. \"Death.\"\\n\\n \"What about death?\" I wonder if we\u0027re finally going to go back to that night.\\n\\n \"That Grady\u0027s going to die,\" she whispers softly. \"And there\u0027s nothing I can do about it.\"\\n\\n I brush her hair back from her forehead. \"You need to stop worrying about everything that can\u0027t be controlled.\"\\n\\n She sighs and leans away from my hand. \"That\u0027s just it, though. It\u0027s all I can think about anymore. It\u0027s like this fixation I have no control over which makes no sense because I\u0027m fixated on controlling the uncontrollable.\" She\u0027s breathing wildly.\\n\\n Shit. I need to calm her down.\\n\\n \"Hey, come here.\" I loop my arms around her waist and lie her down on the windshield with me. She rests her head on my chest and I play with her hair, breathing in her vanilla scent. \"Do you remember when you decided that it would be a good idea if you climbed up the scaffolding in the gym?\"\\n\\n \"I wanted to prove to Gary Bennitt that I was as tough as the boys.\" She buries her face into my shirt, ashamed. \"Why do you remember everything?\"\\n\\n \"How could I forget that? You scared the hell out of me when you fell. Yet, somehow you managed to land on the board just below it.\"\\n\\n \"I thought I was going to die,\" she murmurs. \"I was so stupid.\"\\n\\n \"You weren\u0027t stupid, you just saw life at a different angle,\" I say. \"I\u0027ve always envied you for it. Like when you used to dance in a room where no one was dancing or how you stuck up for people. But there was always that wall you put up. You would never let anyone completely through.\"\\n\\n She\u0027s soundless for a while and I expect for her to push me away. But she sits up and hovers over me, her hair veiling our faces. Her breath is ragged, like she\u0027s terrified out of her mind.\\n\\n \"I opened up to you once,\" she whispers. \"When we were here in this spot doing this same thing.\"\\n\\n I can\u0027t take my eyes off her lips. \"I\u0027m not sure what you\u0027re talking about.\"\\n\\n She licks her lips. \"I told you I didn\u0027t want you dating Cassandra.\"\\n\\n \"Cassandra... Oh, was that what that was about?\" I start to laugh.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s so funny?\" she asks, but I can\u0027t stop laughing. She pinches my nipple and I jerk upward, smacking my forehead against hers. \"Ow.\" She blinks, rubbing her forehead and a laugh escapes her lips. \"Tell me what\u0027s so funny.\"\\n\\n She looks beautiful, trying to be pissed, when deep down she\u0027s relishing the moment. I\u0027m enjoying myself, which I didn\u0027t envisage tonight, but if anyone can cheer me up, it\u0027s her. Like when my dad left and she caught me in the garage, clutching onto his tool box crying like a baby. She gave me her Popsicle and then just sat there with me until I ran out of tears.\\n\\n I eye her over and she fusses with her hair self-consciously. With one quick movement, I flip us over so my body is covering hers. \"When I told Ethan about that day when you told me not to see Cassandra, he told me you had a thing for me. He\u0027s usually not right about those things.\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t have a thing for you,\" she argues. \"I just didn\u0027t want anyone else to have a thing for you.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re adorable when you deny the truth. You always have been.\"\\n\\n \"Micha, I used to have studs on every item of clothing I owned and enough black eyeliner to make an entire sketch. That\u0027s not adorable.\"\\n\\n \"It is on you.\" I wink at her.\\n\\n She shakes her head and pokes a finger at my chest. \"Don\u0027t try and use your player moves on me.\"\\n\\n We remain silent, frozen in the moment, until I finally speak again. \"I have an idea.\" Curiosity slowly takes over her face as I shift over her body. My arms are at the side of her head, barely holding my weight up. My face hovers above hers, our lips only an inch apart, and she lies perfectly still. \"I want to kiss you.\"\\n\\n She shakes her head promptly. \"I don\u0027t think that\u0027s a good idea.\"\\n\\n I trace one of my fingers over her lips. I\u0027ve been going about this all wrong. I can\u0027t force myself on her. I have to move slow and think of her as a skittish cat that needs to be approached cautiously.\\n\\n \"Just kiss. I swear to God that\u0027s all we\u0027ll do.\" I move my finger away from her lips. \"And kissing\u0027s not that scary, right?\"\\n\\n \"With you it is,\" she says truthfully.\\n\\n \"If you want me not to, just say it.\" Taking my time, I leisurely lower my lips toward hers.\\n\\n She stays stationary, her big green eyes targeted on my mouth. Slowly, so she has time to let her thoughts slow down, I caress my lips across hers. A small gasp flees from her lips and I slip my tongue into her mouth. Her hands glide up my back and into my hair. My body conforms to hers as I explore her mouth with my tongue. She bites down on my bottom lip, sucking my lip ring into her mouth before releasing it.\\n\\n Fuck. She\u0027s making this hard. I intensify the kiss as my body becomes more impatient, but I keep my promise and only kiss her, even when she fastens her legs around my waist and rubs up against me.\\n\\n Ella\\n\\n He said just kiss and it seemed okay, but now my body has developed a mind of its own. I\u0027m writhing my hips against him enjoying the pleasure erupting inside me. He\u0027s hard between my legs as he kisses me so fiercely that my lips are swollen. His fingers tangle in my hair and his tongue plunges deeper and deeper into my mouth the more I rock against him. My head falls back and my eyes open to the stars shining in the sky. It feels like I\u0027m falling or flying... I\u0027m not sure, but whatever it is I can\u0027t seem to control it. For a second, I want to capture the moment, put it in a jar, and always have it with me, but panic seizes my mind and I jerk away from his lips.\\n\\n His eyes snap open and his pupils are vast. \"What\u0027s wrong?\"\\n\\n \"Nothing... It\u0027s just... I have to calm down.\" I take a deep breath, my skin still tingling in the spots his hands touched.\\n\\n Micha nods, breathless. Carefully, he moves off of me and leans back against the window, securing his hand around mine. We don\u0027t speak as we stare up at the sky. He traces his finger along the folds between my fingers and my eyelids drift shut. I feel a wall crumble, leaving behind dust, debris, and pieces that desperately need to be put back together.\\n\\n \"Are you okay?\" I ask Micha when we pull into my driveway. He\u0027s been quiet the whole drive home and I can tell something\u0027s bothering him.\\n\\n \"Yeah, I\u0027m fine,\" he says with a shrug and then his gaze darts to the back window as headlights shine up behind us. \"Although, you might not be.\"\\n\\n My eyebrows furrow. \"Why? What\u0027s wrong?\"\\n\\n He points a finger at a car parking at the curb in front of my house; a shiny black Mercedes with a familiar blonde-haired driver sitting in it.\\n\\n \"Oh my God, is that Lila\u0027s car?\" I ask.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m guessing yes, since I doubt anyone around here owns a Mercedes.\"\\n\\n Lila climbs out of the car and it\u0027s clear that she\u0027s been crying. Her eyes are swollen and her cheeks are red. She has her pajama bottoms on and a hoodie pulled over her head. The last time she walked around in an outfit like that she\u0027d just broken up with her boyfriend.\\n\\n \"I think she might have some issues at home,\" I tell him, grabbing the door handle. \"She acted like she didn\u0027t want to go home.\"\\n\\n \"But you didn\u0027t ask her about it?\" he questions with an arch of his eyebrow.\\n\\n I bite my lip guiltily. \"I wasn\u0027t sure I wanted to know the answer.\" God, I\u0027m a terrible friend.\\n\\n Lila heads up the driveway and we get out to meet her around the back. Before I can say anything, she hugs me and starts to sob. I tense, not used to being hugged, except by Micha.\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t want to go back there,\" she cries. \"I knew this was going to happen.\"\\n\\n I look over Lila\u0027s head at Micha for help. \"It\u0027ll be okay.\"\\n\\n He gives me a sympathetic look and mouths, take her inside.\\n\\n I nod and he waves at me, getting back into his car. I guide Lila into the house holding her weight up for her like she\u0027s ill. When I get her into my room, she curls up on my bed and hugs a pillow.\\n\\n I wait a minute before I speak. \"Do you want to talk about it?\"\\n\\n She shakes her head. \"I just want to go to sleep.\"\\n\\n \"Alright.\" I turn off the light and collapse onto the trundle. I need to get into my pajamas, but it\u0027s been an exhausting day.\\n\\n \"My dad hates me,\" Lila whispers through sobs.\\n\\n I freeze and then sit up, squinting at her through the dark. \"I\u0027m sure he doesn\u0027t hate you.\"\\n\\n \"Yes, he does,\" she says. \"He always says so - that he wished he had sons instead of daughters because they\u0027re easier to deal with.\"\\n\\n \"Are you going to be okay?\" I ask, unsure what else to say.\\n\\n \"I will be. It\u0027ll just take some time.\"\\n\\n Was that the magical cure? Time. I flop back down and fall asleep to the murmur of her sobs. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-secret-of-ella-and-micha-the-secret-1/page-11.html","bookId":1861,"book":{"id":1861,"title":"The Secret of Ella and Micha (The Secret #1)","description":"Storyline: A rule-breaker with a fiery attitude, Ella always wore her heart on her sleeve.
