She piles the last box into her trunk and slides her glasses over her eyes. \"Hmmm... let me think. Go back to a home where I\u0027m nothing but a burden? Or go back to the campus with you and have some fun?\" I pick some dirt out from underneath my fingernail. \"I\u0027m just making sure, before you get too committed.\" She takes my hands and gives them a swing. \"I want to go with you, okay, so go say good-bye to your dad so we can hit the road.\" \"Okay, I\u0027ll be right back.\" I head across the front lawn for the door when Ethan\u0027s truck pulls up in my driveway. I walk up to his window and rest my arms on it. \"So you got my message I take it?\" He looks like he just came from work, grease on his face and clothes, and his dark hair has some shavings of rust in it. \"Yeah, I figured I\u0027d come and say good-bye to both of you.\" I slant my head to the side and pierce him with an accusing gaze. \"Don\u0027t try and pretend that you\u0027re here for me.\" He places his hand over his heart, faking hurt. \"My heart is breaking and you\u0027re making jokes. Wow, you really are evil.\" \"Yeah, yeah,\" I back up so he can open the door and climb out. \"I\u0027ll give you two a minute.\" \"I think you\u0027ve overestimating what\u0027s going on between the two of us.\" \"Well, I wouldn\u0027t have to if one of you would tell me what\u0027s going on.\" He shrugs and then rounds the back of the truck. Rolling my eyes, I walk into the house to tell my dad I\u0027m leaving and that I plan on coming back in a couple weeks to meet up with Dean. After a long talk on the phone with him - and I\u0027m sure a lot of persuading from Caroline - we decided to meet up here, when Dean can take off work, and give my dad an ultimatum. It\u0027s probably one of the hardest things I\u0027ll have to do, because I know there will be things said during the conversation that will hurt me. I\u0027m going to push through it, though, because now I understand what I can handle. I find him on the couch, eating a microwave dinner, with a six-pack on the table in front of him. He\u0027s watching the television, with a cigarette in his hand, and he barely notices me enter the room. \"Hey Dad,\" I say from the doorway. \"I\u0027m getting ready to leave.\" He rips his eyes from the television, startled, and I wonder if he was even watching it or if he was dwelling in his thoughts. \"Oh, okay, well drive safely.\" I rub my sweaty palms together and walk into the room. \"Dean and I are going to be coming back in a few weeks.\" He sets his tray down and grabs a beer. \"What for?\" I pat my hands on the sides of my legs uneasily. \"We want to talk to you about something.\" He sets the beer down. \"I thought Dean was still here.\" I shake my head, feeling guiltier about leaving. \"He went home a week or two ago... but Dad, can you try and take care of yourself a little bit better?\" I take a deep breath and throw a hint out into the open. \"And maybe stop drinking so much?\" He glances at the row of beers in front of him like he just realized they were there. \"Oh, I don\u0027t drink that much, do I?\" I sigh and sit down on the couch beside him. \"You didn\u0027t used to, but now it\u0027s kinda all you do.\" He bobs his head up and down. \"Alright, I\u0027ll try to cut back.\" I know he won\u0027t, but hopefully Dean and I will be able to convince him to go to rehab where he can get the help and counseling that he needs. I give him a hug, even though he winces. Then I walk away, hoping he\u0027ll be okay, but knowing that until he makes the decision to change all I can do is try to help him.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-secret-of-ella-and-micha-the-secret-1/page-25.html","bookId":1861,"book":{"id":1861,"title":"The Secret of Ella and Micha (The Secret #1)","description":"Storyline: A rule-breaker with a fiery attitude, Ella always wore her heart on her sleeve.
