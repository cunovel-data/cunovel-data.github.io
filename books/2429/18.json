{"id":100896,"no":18,"title":"Page 18","content":"Commissioner Enderby\u0027s eyes narrowed and he glared at Baley. \"What are you going to do? You tried something like this in Fastolfe\u0027s dome yesterday morning. Not again. Please.\"\n Baley nodded. \"I know. I was wrong the first time.\"\n He thought, fiercely: Also the second time. But not now, not this time, not...\"\n The thought faded out, spluttering like a micropile under a positronic damper.\n He said, \"Judge for yourself, Commissioner. Grant that the evidence against me has been planted. Go that far with me and see where it takes you. Ask yourself who could have planted that evidence. Obviously only someone who\u0027d known I was in the Williamsburg plant yesterday evening.\"\n \"All right. Who would that be?\"\n Baley said, \"I was followed out of the kitchen by a Medievalist group. I lost them, or I thought I did, but obviously at least one of them saw me pass through the plant. My only purpose in doing so, you understand, was to help me lose them.\"\n The Commissioner considered. \"Clousarr? Was he with them?\"\n Baley nodded.\n Enderby said, \"All right, we\u0027ll question him. If he\u0027s got anything in him, we\u0027ll have it out of him. What more can I do, Lije?\"\n \"Wait, now. Don\u0027t quit on me. Do you see my point?\"\n \"Well, let\u0027s see if I do?\" The Commissioner clasped his hands. \"Clousarr saw you go into the Williamsburg power plant, or else someone in his group did and passed the information along to him. He decided to utilize that fact to get you into trouble and off the investigation. Is that what you\u0027re saying?\"\n \"It\u0027s close to it.\"\n \"Good.\" The Commissioner seemed to warm to the task. \"He knew your wife was a member of his organization, naturally, and so he knew you wouldn\u0027t face a really close probe into your private life. He thought you would resign rather than fight circumstantial evidence. By the way, Lije, what about a resignation? I mean, if things looked really bad. We could keep things quiet - \"\n \"Not in a million years, Commissioner.\"\n Enderby shrugged. \"Well, where was I? Oh, yes, so he got an alpha-sprayer, presumably through a confederate in the plant, and had another confederate arrange the destruction of R. Sammy.\" His fingers drummed lightly on the desk. \"No good, Lije.\"\n \"Why not?\"\n \"Too farfetched. Too many confederates. And he has a cast-iron alibi for the night and morning of the Spacetown murder, by the way. We checked that almost right away, though I was the only one who knew the reason for checking that particular time.\"\n Baley said, \"I never said it was Clousarr, Commissioner. You did. It could be anyone in the Medievalist organization. Clousarr is just the owner of a face that Daneel happened to recognize. I don\u0027t even think he\u0027s particularly important in the organization. Though there is one queer thing about him.\"\n \"What?\" asked Enderby, suspiciously.\n \"He did know Jessie was a member. Does he know every member in the organization, do you suppose?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know. He knew about Jessie, anyway. Maybe she was important because she was the wife of a policeman. Maybe he remembered her for that reason.\"\n \"You say he came right out and said that Jezebel Baley was a member. Just like that? Jezebel Baley?\"\n Enderby nodded. \"I keep telling you I heard him.\"\n \"That\u0027s the funny thing, Commissioner. Jessie hasn\u0027t used her full first name since before Bentley was born. Not once. I know that for certain. She joined the Medievalists after she dropped her full name. I know that for sure, too. How would Clousarr come to know her as Jezebel, then?\"\n The Commissioner flushed and said, hastily, \"Oh well, if it comes to that, he probably said Jessie. I just filled it in automatically and gave her full name. In fact, I\u0027m sure of that. He said Jessie.\"\n \"Until now you were quite sure he said Jezebel. I asked several times.\"\n The Commissioner\u0027s voice rose. \"You\u0027re not saying I\u0027m a liar, are you?\"\n \"I\u0027m just wondering if Clousarr, perhaps, said nothing at all. I\u0027m wondering if you made that up. You\u0027ve known Jessie for twenty years, and you knew her name was Jezebel.\"\n \"You\u0027re off your head, man.\"\n \"Am I? Where were you after lunch today? You were out of your office for two hours at least.\"\n \"Are you questioning me?\"\n \"I\u0027ll answer for you, too. You were in the Williamsburg power plant.\"\n The Commissioner rose from his seat. His forehead glistened and there were dry, white flecks at the corners of his lips. \"What the hell are you trying to say?\"\n \"Weren\u0027t you?\"\n \"Baley, you\u0027re suspended. Hand me your credentials.\"\n \"Not yet. Hear me out.\"\n \"I don\u0027t intend to. You\u0027re guilty. You\u0027re guilty as the devil, and what gets me is your cheap attempt to make me, me, look as though I were conspiring against you.\" He lost his voice momentarily in a squeak of indignation. He managed to gasp out, \"In fact, you\u0027re under arrest.\"\n \"No,\" said Baley, tightly, \"not yet. Commissioner, I\u0027ve got a blaster on you. It\u0027s pointed straight and it\u0027s cocked. Don\u0027t fool with me, please, because I\u0027m desperate and I will have my say. Afterward, you can do what you please.\"\n With widening eyes, Julius Enderby stared at the wicked muzzle in Baley\u0027s hands.\n He stammered, \"Twenty years for this, Baley, in the deepest prison level in the City.\"\n R. Daneel moved suddenly. His hand clamped down on Baley\u0027s wrist. He said, quietly, \"I cannot permit this, partner Elijah. You must do no harm to the Commissioner.\"\n For the first time since R. Daneel had entered the City, the Commissioner spoke directly to him. \"Hold him, you. First Law!\"\n Baley said quickly, \"I have no intention of hurting him, Daneel, if you will keep him from arresting me. You said you would help me clear this up. I have forty-five minutes.\"\n R. Daneel, without releasing Baley\u0027s wrist, said, \"Commissioner, I believe Elijah should be allowed to speak. I am in communication with Dr. Fastolfe at this moment - \"\n \"How? How?\" demanded the Commissioner, wildly.\n \"I possess a self-contained subethenic unit,\" said R. Daneel. The Commissioner stared.\n \"I am in communication with Dr. Fastolfe,\" the robot went on inexorably, \"and it would make a bad impression, Commissioner, if you were to refuse to listen to Elijah. Damaging inferences might be drawn.\"\n The Commissioner fell back in his chair, quite speechless. Baley said, \"I say you were in the Williamsburg power plant today, Commissioner, and you got the alpha-sprayer and gave it to R. Sammy. You deliberately chose the Williamsburg power plant in order to incriminate me. You even seized Dr. Gerrigel\u0027s reappearance to invite him down to the Department and give him a deliberately maladjusted guide rod to lead him to the photographic supply room and allow him to find R. Sammy\u0027s remains. You counted on him to make a correct diagnosis.\"\n Baley put away his blaster. \"If you want to have me arrested now, go ahead, but Spacetown won\u0027t take that for an answer.\"\n \"Motive,\" spluttered Enderby breathlessly. His glasses were fogged and he removed them, looking once again curiously vague and helpless in their absence. \"What motive could I have for this?\"\n \"You got me into trouble, didn\u0027t you? It will put a spoke in the Sarton investigation, won\u0027t it? And all that aside, R. Sammy knew too much.\"\n \"About what, in Heaven\u0027s name?\"\n \"About the way in which a Spacer was murdered five and a half days ago. You see, Commissioner, you murdered Dr. Sarton of Spacetown.\"\n It was R. Daneel who spoke. Enderby could only clutch feverishly at his hair and shake his head.\n The robot said, \"Partner Elijah, I am afraid that this theory is quite untenable. As you know, it is impossible for Commissioner Enderby to have murdered Dr. Sarton.\"\n \"Listen, then. Listen to me. Enderby begged me to take the case, not any of the men who over-ranked me. He did that for several reasons. In the first place, we were college friends and he thought he could count on its never occurring to me that an old buddy and respected superior could be a criminal. He counted on my well-known loyalty, you see. Secondly, he knew Jessie was a member of an underground organization and expected to be able to maneuver me out of the investigation or blackmail me into silence if I got too close to the truth. And he wasn\u0027t really worried about that. At the very beginning he did his best to arouse my distrust of you, Daneel, and make certain that the two of us worked at cross-purposes. He knew about my father\u0027s declassification. He could guess how I would react. You see, it is an advantage for the murderer to be in charge of the murder investigation.\"\n The Commissioner found his voice. He said, weakly, \"How could I know about Jessie?\" He turned to the robot. \"You! If you\u0027re transmitting this to Spacetown, tell them it\u0027s a lie! It\u0027s all a lie!\"\n Baley broke in, raising his voice for a moment and then lowering it into a queer sort of tense calm. \"Certainly you would know about Jessie. You\u0027re a Medievalist, and part of the organization. Your old-fashioned spectacles! Your windows! It\u0027s obvious your temperament is turned that way. But there\u0027s better evidence than that.\n \"How did Jessie find out Daneel was a robot? It puzzled me at the time. Of course we know now that she found out through her Medievalist organization, but that just shoves the problem one step backward. How did they know? You, Commissioner, dismissed it with a theory that Daneel was recognized as a robot during the incident at the shoe counter. I didn\u0027t quite believe that. I couldn\u0027t. I took him for human when I first saw him, and there\u0027s nothing wrong with my eyes.\n \"Yesterday, I asked Dr. Gerrigel to come in from Washington. Later I decided I needed him for several reasons, but, at the time I first called him, my only purpose was to see if he would recognize Daneel for what he was with no prompting on my part.\n \"Commissioner, he didn\u0027t! I introduced him to Daneel, he shook hands with him, we all talked together, and it was only after the subject got around to humanoid robots that he suddenly caught on. Now, that was Dr. Gerrigel, Earth\u0027s greatest expert on robots. Do you mean to say a few Medievalist rioters could do better than he under conditions of confusion and tension, and be so certain about it that they would throw their entire organization into activity based on the feeling that Daneel was a robot?\n \"It\u0027s obvious now that the Medievalists must have known Daneel to be a robot to begin with. The incident at the shoe counter was deliberately designed to show Daneel and, through him, Spacetown, the extent of anti-robot feeling in the City. It was meant to confuse the issue, to turn suspicion away from individuals and toward the population as a whole.\n \"Now, if they knew the truth about Daneel to begin with, who told them? I didn\u0027t. I once thought it was Daneel himself, but that\u0027s out. The only other Earthman who knew about it was you, Commissioner.\"\n Enderby said, with surprising energy, \"There could be spies in the Department, too. The Medievalists could have us riddled with them. Your wife was one, and if you don\u0027t find it impossible that I should be one, why not others in the Department?\"\n The corners of Baley\u0027s lips pulled back a savage trifle. \"Let\u0027s not bring up mysterious spies until we see where the straightforward solution leads us. I say you\u0027re the obvious informer and the real one.\n \"It\u0027s interesting now that I look back on it, Commissioner, to see how your spirits rose and fell accordingly as I seemed to be far from a solution or possibly close to it. You were nervous to begin with. When I wanted to visit Spacetown yesterday morning and wouldn\u0027t tell you the reason, you were practically in a state of collapse. Did you think I had you pinned, Commissioner? That it was a trap to get you into their hands? You hated them, you told me. You were virtually in tears. For a time, I thought that to be caused by the memory of humiliation in Spacetown when you yourself were a suspect, but then Daneel told me that your sensibilities had been carefully regarded. You had never known you were a suspect. Your panic was due to fear, not humiliation.\n \"Then when I came out with my completely wrong solution, while you listened over trimensional circuit, and you saw how far, how immensely far, from the truth I was, you were confident again. You even argued with me, defended the Spacers. After that, you were quite master of yourself for a while, quite confident. It surprised me at the time that you so easily forgave my false accusations against the Spacers when earlier you had so lectured me on their sensitivity. You enjoyed my mistake.\n \"Then I put in my call for Dr. Gerrigel and you wanted to know why and I wouldn\u0027t tell you. That plunged you into the abyss again because you feared - \"\n R. Daneel suddenly raised his hand. \"Partner Elijah!\"\n Baley looked at his watch. 23:42! He said, \"What is it?\"\n R. Daneel said, \"He might have been disturbed at thinking you would find out his Medievalist connections, if we grant their existence. There is nothing, though, to connect him with the murder. He cannot have had anything to do with that.\"\n Baley said, \"You\u0027re quite wrong, Daneel. He didn\u0027t know what I wanted Dr. Gerrigel for, but it was quite safe to assume that it was in connection with information about robots. This frightened the Commissioner, because a robot had an intimate connection with his greater crime. Isn\u0027t that so, Commissioner?\"\n Enderby shook his head. \"When this is over - \" he began, but choked into inarticulacy.\n \"How was the murder committed?\" demanded Baley with a suppressed fury. \"C/Fe, damn it! C/Fe! I use your own term, Daneel. You\u0027re so full of the benefits of a C/Fe culture, yet you don\u0027t see where an Earthman might have used it for at least a temporary advantage. Let me sketch it in for you.\n \"There is no difficulty in the notion of a robot crossing open country. Even at night. Even alone. The Commissioner put a blaster into R. Sammy\u0027s hand, told him where to go and when. He himself entered Spacetown through the Personal and was relieved of his own blaster. He received the other from R. Sammy\u0027s hands, killed Dr. Sarton, returned the blaster to R. Sammy, who took it back across the fields to New York City. And today he destroyed R. Sammy, whose knowledge had become dangerous.\n \"That explains everything. The presence of the Commissioner, the absence of a weapon. And it makes it unnecessary to suppose any human New Yorker had crawled a mile under the open sky at night.\"\n But at the end of Baley\u0027s recitation, R. Daneel said, \"I am sorry, partner Elijah, though happy for the Commissioner, that your story explains nothing. I have told you that the cerebroanalytic properties of the Commissioner are such that it is impossible for him to have committed deliberate murder. I don\u0027t know what English word would be applied to the psychological fact: cowardice, conscience, or compassion. I know the dictionary meanings of all these, but I cannot judge. At any rate, the Commissioner did not murder.\"\n \"Thank you,\" muttered Enderby. His voice gained strength and confidence. \"I don\u0027t know what your motives are, Baley, or why you should try to ruin me this way, but I\u0027ll get to the bottom - \"\n \"Wait,\" said Baley. \"I\u0027m not through. I\u0027ve got this.\"\n He slammed the aluminum cube on Enderby\u0027s desk, and tried to feel the confidence he hoped he was radiating. For half an hour now, he had been hiding from himself one little fact: that he did not know what the picture showed. He was gambling, but it was all that was left to do.\n Enderby shrank away from the small object. \"What is it?\"\n \"It isn\u0027t a bomb,\" said Baley, sardonically. \"Just an ordinary microprojector.\"\n \"Well? What will that prove?\"\n \"Suppose we see.\" His fingernail probed at one of the slits in the cube, and a corner of the Commissioner\u0027s office blanked out, then lit up in an alien scene in three dimensions.\n It reached from floor to ceiling and extended out past the walls of the room. It was awash with a gray light of a sort the City\u0027s utilities never provided.\n Baley thought, with a pang of mingled distaste and perverse attraction: It must be the dawn they talk about.\n The pictured scene was of Dr. Sarton\u0027s dome. Dr. Sarton\u0027s dead body, a horrible, broken remnant, filled its center.\n Enderby\u0027s eyes bulged as he stared.\n Baley said, \"I know the Commissioner isn\u0027t a killer. I don\u0027t need you to tell me that, Daneel. If I could have gotten around that one fact earlier, I would have had the solution earlier. Actually, I didn\u0027t see a way out of it until an hour ago when I carelessly said to you that you had once been curious about Bentley\u0027s contact lenses. - That was it, Commissioner. It occurred to me then that your nearsightedness and your glasses were the key. They don\u0027t have nearsightedness on the Outer Worlds, I suppose, or they might have reached the true solution of the murder almost at once. Commissioner, when did you break your glasses?\"\n The Commissioner said, \"What do you mean?\"\n Baley said, \"When I first saw you about this case, you told me you had broken your glasses in Spacetown. I assumed that you broke them in your agitation on hearing the news of the murder, but you never said so, and I had no reason for making that assumption. Actually, if you were entering Spacetown with crime on your mind, you were already sufficiently agitated to drop and break your glasses before the murder. Isn\u0027t that so, and didn\u0027t that, in fact, happen?\"\n R. Daneel said, \"I do not see the point, partner Elijah.\"\n Baley thought: I\u0027m partner Elijah for ten minutes more. Fast! Talk fast! And think fast!\n He was manipulating Sarton\u0027s dome image as he spoke. Clumsily, he expanded it, his fingernails unsure in the tension that was overwhelming him. Slowly, in jerks, the corpse widened, broadened, heightened, came closer. Baley could almost smell the stench of its scorched flesh. Its head, shoulders, and one upper arm lolled crazily, connected to hips and legs by a blackened remnant of spine from which charred rib stumps jutted.\n Baley cast a side glance at the Commissioner. Enderby had closed his eyes. He looked sick. Baley felt sick, too, but he had to look. Slowly he circled the trimensional image by means of the transmitter controls, rotating it, bringing the ground about the corpse to view in successive quadrants. His fingernail slipped and the imaged floor tilted suddenly and expanded till floor and corpse alike were a hazy mass, beyond the resolving power of the transmitter. He brought the expansion down, let the corpse slide away.\n He was still talking. He had to. He couldn\u0027t stop till he found what he was looking for. And if he didn\u0027t, all his talk might be useless. Worse than useless. His heart was throbbing, and so was his head.\n He said, \"The Commissioner can\u0027t commit deliberate murder. True! Deliberate. But any man can kill by accident. The Commissioner didn\u0027t enter Spacetown to kill Dr. Sarton. He came in to kill you, Daneel, you! Is there anything in his cerebroanalysis that says he is incapable of wrecking a machine? That\u0027s not murder, merely sabotage.\n \"He is a Medievalist, an earnest one. He worked with Dr. Sarton and knew the purpose for which you were designed, Daneel. He feared that purpose might be achieved, that Earthmen would eventually be weaned away from Earth. So he decided to destroy you, Daneel. You were the only one of your type manufactured as yet and he had good reason to think that by demonstrating the extent and determination of Medievalism on Earth, he would discourage the Spacers. He knew how strong popular opinion was on the Outer Worlds to end the Spacetown project altogether. Dr. Sarton must have discussed that with him. This, he thought, would be the last nudge in the proper direction.\n \"I don\u0027t say even the thought of killing you, Daneel, was a pleasant one. He would have had R. Sammy do it, I imagine, if you didn\u0027t look so human that a primitive robot such as Sammy could not have told the difference, or understood it. First Law would stop him. Or the Commissioner would have had another human do it if he, himself, were not the only one who had ready access to Spacetown at all times.\n \"Let me reconstruct what the Commissioner\u0027s plan might have been. I\u0027m guessing, I admit, but I think I\u0027m close. He made the appointment with Dr. Sarton, but deliberately came early, at dawn, in fact. Dr. Sarton would be sleeping, I imagine, but you, Daneel, would be awake. I assume, by the way, you were living with Dr. Sarton, Daneel.\"\n The robot nodded. \"You are quite right, partner Elijah.\"\n Baley said, \"Then let me go on. You would come to the dome door, Daneel, receive a blaster charge in the chest or head, and be done with. The Commissioner would leave quickly, through the deserted streets of Spacetown\u0027s dawn, and back to where R. Sammy waited. He would give him back the blaster, then slowly walk again to Dr. Sarton\u0027s dome. If necessary, he would \u0027discover\u0027 the body himself, though he would prefer to have someone else do that. If questioned concerning his early arrival, he could say, I suppose, that he had come to tell Dr. Sarton of rumors of a Medievalist attack on Spacetown, urge him to take secret precautions to avoid open trouble between Spacers and Earthmen. The dead robot would lend point to his words.\n \"If they asked about the long interval between your entering Spacetown, Commissioner, and your arrival at Dr. Sarton\u0027s dome, you could say - let\u0027s see - that you saw someone lurking through the streets and heading for open country. You pursued for a while. That would also encourage them along a false path. As for R. Sammy, no one would notice him. A robot among the truck farms outside the City is just another robot.\n \"How close am I, Commissioner?\"\n Enderby writhed, \"I didn\u0027t - \"\n \"No,\" said Baley, \"you didn\u0027t kill Daneel. He\u0027s here, and in all the time he\u0027s been in the City, you haven\u0027t been able to look him in the face or address him by name. Look at him now, Commissioner.\"\n Enderby couldn\u0027t. He covered his face with shaking hands.\n Baley\u0027s shaking hands almost dropped his transmitter. He had found it.\n The image was now centered upon the main door to Dr. Sarton\u0027s dome. The door was open; it had been slid into its wall receptacle along its shining metal runner grooves. Down within them. There! There!\n The sparkle was unmistakable.\n \"I\u0027ll tell you what happened,\" said Baley. \"You were at the dome when you dropped your glasses. You must have been nervous and I\u0027ve seen you when you\u0027re nervous. You take them off; you wipe them. You did that then. But your hands were shaking and you dropped them; maybe you stepped on them. Anyway, they were broken, and just then, the door opened and a figure that looked like Daneel faced you.\n \"You blasted him, scrabbled up the remains of your glasses, and ran. They found the body, not you, and when they came to find you, you discovered that it was not Daneel, but the early-rising Dr. Sarton, that you had killed. Dr. Sarton had designed Daneel in his own image, to his great misfortune, and without your glasses in that moment of tension, you could not tell them apart.\n \"And if you want the tangible proof, it\u0027s there!\" The image of Sarton\u0027s dome quivered and Baley put the transmitter carefully upon the desk, his hand tightly upon it.\n Commissioner Enderby\u0027s face was distorted with terror and Baley\u0027s with tension. R. Daneel seemed indifferent.\n Baley\u0027s finger was pointing. \"That glitter in the grooves of the door. What was it, Daneel?\"\n \"Two small slivers of glass,\" said the robot, coolly. \"It meant nothing to us.\"\n \"It will now. They\u0027re portions of concave lenses. Measure their optical properties and compare them with those of the glasses Enderby is wearing now. Don\u0027t smash them, Commissioner!\"\n He lunged at the Commissioner and wrenched the spectacles from the other\u0027s hand. He held them out to R. Daneel, panting, \"That\u0027s proof enough, I think, that he was at the dome earlier than he was thought to be.\"\n R. Daneel said, \"I am quite convinced. I can see now that I was thrown completely off the scent by the Commissioner\u0027s cerebroanalysis. I congratulate you, partner Elijah.\"\n Baley\u0027s watch said 24:00. A new day was beginning.\n Slowly, the Commissioner\u0027s head went down on his arms. His words were muffled wails. \"It was a mistake. A mistake. I never meant to kill him?\" Without warning, he slipped from the chair and lay crumpled on the floor.\n R. Daneel sprang to him, saying, \"You have hurt him, Elijah. That is too bad.\"\n \"He isn\u0027t dead, is he?\"\n \"No. But unconscious.\"\n \"He\u0027ll come to. It was too much for him, I suppose. I had to do it, Daneel, I had to. I had no evidence that would stand up in court, only inferences. I had to badger him and badger him and let it out little by little, hoping he would break down. He did, Daneel. You heard him confess, didn\u0027t you?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"Now, then, I promised this would be to the benefit of Spacetown\u0027s project, so - Wait, he\u0027s coming to.\"\n The Commissioner groaned. His eyes fluttered and opened. He stared speechlessly at the two.\n Baley said, \"Commissioner, do you hear me?\"\n The Commissioner nodded listlessly.\n \"All right, then. Now, the Spacers have more on their minds than your prosecution. If you co-operate with them - \"\n \"What? What?\" There was a dawning flicker of hope in the Commissioner\u0027s eyes.\n \"You must be a big wheel in New York\u0027s Medievalist organization, maybe even in the planetary setup. Maneuver them in the direction of the colonization of space. You can see the propaganda line, can\u0027t you? We can go back to the soil all right - but on other planets.\"\n \"I don\u0027t understand,\" mumbled the Commissioner.\n \"It\u0027s what the Spacers are after. And God help me, it\u0027s what I\u0027m after now, too, since a small conversation I had with Dr. Fastolfe. It\u0027s what they want more than anything. They risk death continually by coming to Earth and staying here for that purpose. If Dr. Sarton\u0027s murder will make it possible for you to swing Medievalism into line for the resumption of Galactic colonization, they\u0027ll probably consider it a worthwhile sacrifice. Do you understand now?\"\n R. Daneel said, \"Elijah is quite correct. Help us, Commissioner, and we will forget the past. I am speaking for Dr. Fastolfe and our people generally in this. Of course, if you should agree to help and later betray us, we would always have the fact of your guilt to hold over your head. I hope you understand that, too. It pains me to have to mention that.\"\n \"I won\u0027t be prosecuted?\" asked the Commissioner.\n \"Not if you help us.\"\n Tears filled his eyes. \"I\u0027ll do it. It was an accident. Explain that. An accident. I did what I thought right.\"\n Baley said, \"If you help us, you will be doing right. The colonization of space is the only possible salvation of Earth. You\u0027ll realize that if you think about it without prejudice. If you find you cannot, have a short talk with Dr. Fastolfe. And now, you can begin helping by quashing the R. Sammy business. Call it an accident or something. End it!\"\n Baley got to his feet. \"And remember, I\u0027m not the only one who knows the truth, Commissioner. Getting rid of me will ruin you. All Spacetown knows. You see that, don\u0027t you?\"\n R. Daneel said, \"It is unnecessary to say more, Elijah. He is sincere and he will help. So much is obvious from his cerebroanalysis.\"\n \"All right. Then I\u0027ll go home. I want to see Jessie and Bentley and take up a natural existence again. And I want to sleep. - Daneel, will you stay on Earth after the Spacers go?\"\n R. Daneel said, \"I have not been informed. Why do you ask?\"\n Baley bit his lip, then said, \"I didn\u0027t think I would ever say anything like this to anyone like you, Daneel, but I trust you. I even - admire you. I\u0027m too old ever to leave Earth myself, but when schools for emigrants are finally established, there\u0027s Bentley. If someday, perhaps, Bentley and you, together...\"\n \"Perhaps.\" R. Daneel\u0027s face was emotionless.\n The robot turned to Julius Enderby, who was watching them with a flaccid face into which a certain vitality was only now beginning to return.\n The robot said, \"I have been trying, friend Julius, to understand some remarks Elijah made to me earlier.
