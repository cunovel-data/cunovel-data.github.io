{"id":85370,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"14 Conner\u0027s eyes opened. He tried to focus, blinked up at the Amazon blur standing over him. Becker. Beyond her was the cracked and stained ceiling. He said, \"Had enough?\" \"I didn\u0027t kill James,\" she said. \"Just out of curiosity, what did you think you were going to do?\" Good question. \"Take you to the police?\" \"You really want the cops involved?\" He didn\u0027t say anything, rubbed his jaw. \"Let\u0027s put our cards on the table,\" suggested Becker. She helped him up. They sat across from each other at Conner\u0027s kitchen table, and Becker explained how James had been alive and well when she\u0027d been there. \"You were probably the last person to see him alive.\" \"Except for whoever murdered him,\" Becker said flatly. \"Sure. Right.\" \"I didn\u0027t kill him.\" Conner threw up his hands. \"Fine. I believe you.\" And he did. Now that he thought about it, he couldn\u0027t figure a reason for Becker to do it. Somebody else had whacked James. Somebody with a motive. It was all guesswork and gut instinct. On the other hand, his gut instincts had put him in the hole with Rocky Big. His gut instincts were shit. \"Why did you go see James if you hadn\u0027t found the sailboat?\" she asked. He thought about coming clean but lied instead. \"To tell him I was dropping the case. Folger and the boat are long gone. Probably Mexico or Jamaica.\" She looked at him hard, didn\u0027t speak for long seconds. She put her business card on the table between them, tapped it with an index finger. \"I think you know more than you\u0027re letting on, Samson. Shit happens. Things got dicey or maybe more complicated than you thought, so now you want to wash your hands of the whole deal. Am I close?\" \"It\u0027s not like that.\" Yes it is! She shook her head. \"I don\u0027t want any explanations. James meant nothing to me. Too bad he\u0027s dead, but I have my own concerns. So chill. I\u0027m not going to rat you. I meant what I said. I can make it worth your while.\" \"Why are you looking for Folger?\" She thought for a second, then said, \"He made off with something valuable. The rightful owners want it back.\" \"What is it?\" She said, \"None of your business.\" Conner scratched his chin, bit his lip. \"How much are we talking?\" She shrugged. All casual now. \"You give me something good, a name, an address, something to put me back on Folger\u0027s trail, I could go five hundred. Cash.\" That wouldn\u0027t even get Rocky Big off my back. \"I\u0027ll call you if I remember anything.\" \"I\u0027d prefer you remember now.\" \"And I\u0027d prefer two thousand.\" She looked around Conner\u0027s dank kitchen, stood, wiped dust off the counter. \"Take what you can get, Samson. The cell phone is always on.\" She showed herself out. Samson knew something. Becker was sure of it. It might even be something worth two thousand dollars, but the thought of some two-bit repo man putting the bite on her irritated Becker more than anything. In the old days, she\u0027d gotten a little impatient with some of the rat-fink informants she used on a regular basis. A black eye here, a broken wrist there. There had been complaints, warnings. That special ops stuff didn\u0027t rub with routine fieldwork. She had refused her superiors\u0027 suggestion to think about anger management therapy. They had trained her to kick ass and now wanted a kinder, gentler intelligence community. She\u0027d been caught in the shift, set adrift between administrations. Her file was a checkerboard of iffy judgment calls and reprimands. All of this had been used against Becker at her final performance evaluation. She\u0027d been given two choices. Resign from the NSA or staff the company\u0027s office in Blue Elk, Alaska. \"I didn\u0027t know we had an office in Blue Elk,\" Becker had said. \"We\u0027ll open one,\" the evaluation board had assured her. So she\u0027d gone into the private sector. Security consultant, investigations, easy money with no challenge. Now she was looking for a baseball card. Enough was enough. With the potential payoff she could buy a villa in Spain and forget all this. But would that really satisfy her? She tried to picture herself living a life of leisure, reading a trashy romance novel by the pool, but she couldn\u0027t quite see it. Right now, anything was preferable to the drudgery of the insurance office. She climbed into her black Oldsmobile and drove once around the block. She came back, parked under the low-hanging branches of an oak tree and watched Samson\u0027s apartment from a safe distance. He knows something. I get the vibe. The way he doesn\u0027t make eye contact. Let\u0027s see what\u0027s on Mr. Samson\u0027s plate today. She lit a Virginia Slim and waited. After Joellen Becker left his apartment, Conner watched his front door, waiting for her to walk back in. She didn\u0027t. \"Fucking shit.\" He should have taken the five hundred. What in hell made him think he could negotiate her up to two thousand? She\u0027d been right. Conner should have taken what he could get. He grabbed Becker\u0027s business card and ran for the phone. No time to be proud. Take what you can get. Damn right. He picked up the phone, and it fell apart. His tape job hadn\u0027t held up. He spent twenty minutes trying to put it back together again, but the telephone was finally, irrevocably, deceased. He put the keys to the Plymouth in his pocket and headed for the front door. He\u0027d drive to the convenience store and use the pay phone. As soon as Conner was outside, big black hands fell on his shoulders. 15 Fat Otis put a huge arm around Conner\u0027s shoulders, crushing him in a half hug, lifting him off the sidewalk. Conner\u0027s feet momentarily dangled six inches off the ground. \"Conner, pal.\" Otis grinned. \"Going someplace?\" Conner smiled weakly. \"Man, you know I don\u0027t want to do this shit. Why do you put yourself in this position?\" Otis asked, his voice plaintive. \"Bad karma?\" Conner said. \"You gonna bad karma yourself two broken legs if you keep it up.\" Conner thought about squirming out of Otis\u0027s grip, making a run for it. But that wasn\u0027t really a very good idea. Conner was pretty sure he could count on Otis\u0027s friendship just a little while longer. Hopefully long enough to come up with Rocky\u0027s money. Besides, it was a bad idea to make Otis run after him. Fat Otis didn\u0027t enjoy running. Make him run and you got extra bones broken. No, best to play it cool. Conner was safe. For now. Otis looked at Conner, read his mind. \"Yeah, you off the hook for today. I talked Rocky into giving you some more time, but he wasn\u0027t happy about it. So you got to come talk to him. He wants to see you face-to-face.\" \"How about I just send him a postcard?\" Conner said. Otis shook his head. \"Nope.\" \"A nice letter with a promissory note for the money.\" \"Get in.\" Otis tossed Conner into the passenger seat of the yellow Lincoln. \"Buckle up.\" Rocky Big haunted the dark, cavernous back rooms and hallways of a dirty downtown building on the cheap side of the arena where the Ice Pilots hockey team played. Pensacola was hardly infamous for its rough neighborhoods. The small city didn\u0027t have a Bedford-Stuyvesant or a South Bronx, but there were a few places somebody could buy crack or get knifed. Playerz Gentleman\u0027s Club fronted Rocky\u0027s building. Otis led Conner past some sleepy-eyed women dancing topless in the smoky red light, past the sluggish day crowd to a back door, which opened into a narrow hall that took them past an unused kitchen and ended finally at Rocky Big\u0027s Forbidden City, a secret hideout of criminal activity that wasn\u0027t really so secret if you were a Pensacola lowlife or a cop on the take. Conner had heard of Rocky\u0027s Forbidden City, but this was the first time he\u0027d seen it. It was like stepping through a door and suddenly you were in Willy Wonka\u0027s chocolate factory. But instead of candy, there was stolen merchandise. Instead of Oompa-Loompas, there were sweaty guys who looked too ugly to be longshoremen. Men loaded trucks to one side of him, unloaded other trucks on the other side, pushed carts or racks filled with Nintendo GameCubes or fur coats or cartons of cigarettes or a hundred other things. Anything stolen that went east or west across Interstate 10 came through the Forbidden City. \"I\u0027ll take you through Applianceville to Rocky\u0027s office,\" Otis said. Applianceville was a long, wide hallway lined with washers, dryers, refrigerators, and microwave ovens. Most were brand-new and still in the original boxes. At the other end of Applianceville, they entered a dark warehouse, stacks of CD players, digital video cameras, laptop computers piled high. The commotion of men loading trucks faded behind them. They passed a reedy little man sitting on a forklift. He had a thin moustache, hair slicked back and oily. When he heard Conner and Otis approach, he reached for the compact machine gun in the seat next to him but left it when he recognized Otis. He went back to reading the newspaper and smoking a stubby cigar. The smell made Conner\u0027s stomach pinch. They walked past the forklift guard, down another short hall to a door lit by a single bare lightbulb swinging from the ceiling. Otis knocked three times. A voice on the other side, Southern, slightly high-pitched. \"Come in, please.\" They went in. At first, Conner thought there must have been a mistake. The little man behind the desk could not have been the Rocky Big that Conner had heard so much about. Conner had always pictured a big, hairy guy with a scar down his face and a gold tooth. Somebody who could make you cry just by looking at you. The man behind the desk was neither rocky nor big nor anything else Conner had expected. Rocky had buttery skin and thick pink lips and dark red hair combed back and wavy like some actor from a 1930s movie. He wore a starched white shirt and a plaid vest buttoned halfway. He stood to offer Conner his hand. Short, barely five and a half feet tall. \"Nice to meet you, Conner,\" Rocky said. \"Can I call you Conner? I hope you\u0027ll call me Rocky. Otis has told me so much about you. Glad we could finally meet.\" He shook Rocky\u0027s hand. Conner tried to smile but his face wouldn\u0027t do it. \"Please have a seat.\" Rocky motioned to a chair. \"I\u0027m sorry my desk is such a mess.\" He indicated an adding machine, ledgers, stacks of computer printouts. \"There\u0027s simply an obscene amount of paperwork involved in an organization like this. You wouldn\u0027t believe it.\" Rocky sat, smiled. They looked at one another. Otis hovered in the background. \"Well.\" Rocky cleared his throat. \"It seems we have an unpleasant financial matter to discuss.\" Conner squirmed. \"Rocky, I-it\u0027s just that-maybe...\" Conner couldn\u0027t figure any positive spin he could put on the fact he didn\u0027t have any money. A knock at the door. Rocky said, \"Hold that thought, won\u0027t you, Conner?\" He looked at Otis, raised an eyebrow. Otis opened the door a crack, had a quick mumbled conversation with someone on the other side. Otis looked over his shoulder at Rocky. \"Jeff is here.\" \"Oh, damn.\" Rocky suddenly looked stricken. \"He\u0027s early. Damn damn damn. I really hate this sort of thing.\" Otis looked concerned. \"Let me handle it, Rocky. You shouldn\u0027t have to do this.\" Rocky took a deep breath. \"No, no. It\u0027s okay. I have to do this in person once in a while, or people will begin to wonder.\" He put a thick phone book in his chair, sat on top of it. He appeared marginally bigger. \"Conner, I hope you don\u0027t mind. Just some business that needs my attention. Could you have a seat over there, please?\" Conner wasn\u0027t sure what was happening, but he was glad the focus had moved away from him. He took the chair on the other side of the office. Rocky said, \"Okay, Otis. Tell him to come in.\" Otis mumbled at somebody through the door crack, and a few seconds later he opened it wide, ushered in a squat man with a scruffy beard. He wore a polo shirt, jeans, sneakers, a gold hoop in each ear. Brillo-pad hair. \"Have a seat, Jeff.\" Rocky\u0027s voice was suddenly lower and rough. A slight scowl on his face, which Conner couldn\u0027t quite decide was convincing or not. \"Sure, Rocky.\" Jeff\u0027s wide smile looked tight and strained. He sat. \"Jeff, I think we need to discuss the twenty-five thousand dollars you owe me.\" Jeff\u0027s eyes slid sideways to Conner a moment, then back to Rocky. Conner noticed Otis had moved to stand behind Jeff\u0027s chair. \"Like I told your boys, Rocky,\" Jeff said. \"It\u0027s just a little delay. My dumb-ass brother-in-law had to make a run to Mexico, right? And he had the dates wrong and now it\u0027s just a simple delay with the merchandise.\" \"I made you a loan,\" Rocky said. \"The particulars are of no interest to me.\" \"Right, right. I know. I hear you.\" Jeff bobbed his head. Agreeable. \"And I totally respect what you\u0027re saying. But I give you my one hundred percent promise that this deal I\u0027m working on is a slam dunk. We needed you to finance us because we were up against a time thing, but as soon as my idiot brother-in-law comes back with the goods, we got a buyer waiting no problem and everybody gets paid.\" He snapped his fingers. \"Just like that.\" Rocky sighed. \"Otis.\" Otis grabbed Jeff\u0027s right arm, held it. Jeff squirmed. \"What is this? Hey!\" Otis took Jeff\u0027s hand, grabbed the pinky finger, twisted. Snap. The noise made Conner flinch. Jeff howled. \"Again.\" Rocky\u0027s voice was barely above a whisper. He looked straight into Jeff\u0027s face, didn\u0027t blink. Otis grabbed the next finger. Jeff tried to pull away. \"Hey, now wait-I said wait just a-\" Snap. Jeff screamed. He\u0027d gone pale, a thin sheen of sweat across his forehead. \"Rocky, please, I-\" Rocky nodded, and Otis broke another finger. Then another. A strangled, agonizing noise caught in Jeff\u0027s throat. He went from pale to red to green in two seconds flat. Conner decided to look at his shoes. He felt cold and sick. \"They\u0027re only fingers,\" Rocky said. \"So you can still walk out of here. But next time we do the legs. Then after that, you don\u0027t walk out of here at all. Are we clear on this?\" Jeff\u0027s mouth hung open. He looked at his wrecked hand, nodded. \"Otis, give the man his hand back. Jeff, see you in three days. Bring money.\" Otis helped Jeff stand. He wobbled on trembling legs, cradled his hand against his chest. Otis led him out of the office, shut the door behind them. Rocky stood, shook his soft hands, shivered. \"God, but I hate that. Oh, I think I\u0027m going to be ill.\" He shoved the phone book off his seat and onto the floor. \"I simply detest violence.\" He sat down again, breathing deeply. Otis returned with a glass of water. He dropped in two tablets, and the water fizzed. He went to Rocky, put a gentle hand on the little man\u0027s shoulder. \"Your stomach?\" He handed Rocky the glass. \"Drink it before it goes flat.\" Rocky took the glass, drank it down, made a sour face, and put a hand on his chest. \"When I heard the first finger break, I really thought I was going to lose it.\" He set the glass on his desk. Otis\u0027s hand was still on Rocky\u0027s shoulder. Rocky covered the big guy\u0027s hand with one of his own, offered Otis a grateful look. \"You\u0027re too good to me.\" \"You need anything else, Rock?\" Rocky shook his head, smiled. \"Let me have a word with your friend Conner, okay?\" \"Sure.\" Otis flicked a two-finger salute at Conner. \"Later, Conner-man.\" He left. Rocky gestured Conner back to the seat across from his desk. \"I\u0027m sorry you had to see that.\" Me too, thought Conner. \"Conner, I\u0027ve decided we\u0027re not going to take any more bets from you. I\u0027m letting all my bookmakers know, so that\u0027s really all there is to it.\" \"What?\" Rocky looked slightly embarrassed. \"Now, don\u0027t be hard on Otis. It was his idea. He thinks you\u0027re going to get yourself in trouble. Otis speaks highly of you, so I\u0027d like to start considering you a friend of the family. It would be extremely awkward if you got in over your head, and we had to break every bone in your body. And I think you know now that having to do that would upset me just as much as it would upset you.\" Conner doubted that, but kept silent. \"In fact, Otis says you might be a useful fellow to have around,\" Rocky said. \"If you\u0027re having money troubles, perhaps some sort of employment in my organization...\" \"That\u0027s okay, Rocky,\" Conner said. \"I always get by somehow.\" \"Of course. You know best. All that\u0027s left is to settle up the two thousand you owe me.\" Conner gulped. \"I thought, well, since I\u0027m pals with Otis, and since, you know, you\u0027re cutting me off from the bookies... I thought you were letting me off the hook.\" Rocky sucked air through his teeth. \"Mmmmmmm.\" He shook his head, looked genuinely pained. \"I\u0027m afraid business is business. I just can\u0027t do that. I hope you understand it\u0027s nothing personal. My goodness, no. I can\u0027t let anyone off the hook. It wouldn\u0027t look right.\" A lead weight settled in Conner\u0027s stomach. His mouth was dry. Conner wondered if he\u0027d been allowed to watch Otis bust Jeff\u0027s fingers in order to make a very specific point. \"I can see this comes at a bad time,\" Rocky said. \"How about this? Take a few days, get your finances in order, then bring me my money. Let\u0027s say by the end of the week.\" He picked up a pencil, flipped open his Rolodex. \"I\u0027ll even call you with a friendly reminder. What\u0027s your number?\" Conner briefly explained his current telephone woes. Rocky tsked. \"When it rains, it pours, doesn\u0027t it? Come with me.\" Conner followed Rocky out of the office. They passed the machine-gun man, and Rocky said, \"Hello, Pete. Have you met Conner?\" Pete grunted. Rocky and Conner climbed into a golf cart that was parked on the other side of the forklift. Rocky drove. They whizzed past crates of stolen tennis shoes, blenders, sporting goods, and three red BMWs parked in a row. Rocky took the sharp turns at high speed, and Conner held on tight. They screeched to a halt in front of a row of plastic garbage cans and climbed out. Rocky went to the can with the sign PREPAID written in green Magic Marker. The can was full of cell phones, all shapes and sizes. Rocky plucked one from the top, examined it, then tossed it back. He found another, turned it on, and nodded. \"This one has a full charge,\" Rocky said. He scrolled down the cell phone\u0027s menu and found the number. He scribbled it into a little book, which disappeared into a vest pocket. He handed the phone to Conner. \"Thanks.\" Conner turned the phone over in his hands, wondered if he really wanted it. He stuck the phone in his pocket. \"Now we can stay in contact.\" Rocky rubbed his hands together. \"Anything else you need?\" \"I could use a tuxedo.\" Conner had meant it as a joke, but the smile died on his face. He joked when he was nervous, a bad habit that had earned him a few black eyes over the years. \"Come on,\" Rocky said. They sat in the golf cart, and Rocky unfolded a map of the warehouse. \"Tuxedos on the other side. You look like a perfect forty-two to me.\" Conner hung on tight as the cart lurched forward, the warehouse becoming a dark blur of stolen goods. His life had taken a turn for the surreal. He was unable to decide if he was afraid of Rocky or if he\u0027d just made a new pal. \"Shoes,\" Rocky said. \"You\u0027ll need shoes too.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/suicide-squeeze/page-10.html","bookId":2245,"book":{"id":2245,"title":"Suicide Squeeze","description":"Storyline: The Edgar Award-nominated author of \"Gun Monkeys\" delivers an adrenaline rush of a novel that features a special appearance by Joe DiMaggio.
