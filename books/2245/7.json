At no point during the dinner did Moto ever have control of the conversation. He felt steamrolled. Bludgeoned. She was out there somewhere shaking Pensacola by the lapels in search of a small rectangle of cardboard that probably still smelled faintly of stale bubble gum.\n At least he\u0027d had the presence of mind to insist on a copy of the file. He refused to leave the investigation in this woman\u0027s hands and fully intended to pursue the matter independently. Moto went back to his room at the Airport Hilton and pored over the information. The VHS tape was of Folger showing the card to some expert on a public television show. Moto watched the tape. He studied Folger\u0027s facial expressions as the expert appraised the card for insurance purposes. Moto watched Folger\u0027s body language as the expert described the best way to maintain the card and prevent corrosion.\n Based on Folger\u0027s brief television appearance, Moto decided he did not like the man. Folger was impatient and selfish and a little weak it seemed. He\u0027d expected the card to be worth more and felt slighted by the expert\u0027s low appraisal. At heart, Folger was a spoiled child and a bit of a sissy. Five minutes was a very short amount of time to sum up a man\u0027s heart and soul, and Moto realized he could be way off in his estimate. But Moto was seldom wrong in such matters.\n Moto\u0027s cell phone played Darth Vader\u0027s theme from Star Wars.\n He flipped open the little phone. \"I\u0027m here, Mr. Kurisaka.\"\n \"Billy, I sent you a package by FedEx. It should have been delivered to your room.\"\n Moto looked around, saw the box in the middle of the desk. \"It\u0027s here.\"\n \"Open it.\"\n Moto opened it. A heavy-duty metal attach¨¦ case.\n \"Use it to transport the card,\" Kurisaka said. \"I had it specially made. It can survive one hundred fathoms or a fall from twenty thousand feet. Fireproof. Also a small homing beacon built into the lining.\"\n \"Mr. Kurisaka, I\u0027m just not sure all of this is necessary.\"\n \"I want the card well protected.\"\n Moto hesitated a moment, then said, \"Mr. Kurisaka, things are going a bit more slowly than anticipated. I\u0027m having trouble locating Folger. He\u0027s seems to have gone missing and has taken the card with him.\"\n A long pause. \"You don\u0027t think he\u0027s selling the card to... someone else?\"\n \"I couldn\u0027t say,\" Moto admitted. \"I just wanted to make you aware this may take a few days. But as soon as I find him, I will make your offer. A million dollars is much more than the appraised value of the card. I\u0027m sure he won\u0027t refuse.\"\n Moto had no trouble interpreting Kurisaka\u0027s silence. He was displeased.\n Kurisaka said, \"Billy, do what you must. Find him. And if a million dollars isn\u0027t good enough, then convince Folger it is in his best interest to part with the card. Do you understand what I mean?\"\n \"I understand.\"\n \"Good-bye, Billy.\" He hung up.\n Moto considered Kurisaka\u0027s words. Moto knew when he started working for the billionaire that he would be asked to do difficult things. A man like Kurisaka did not need another administrative assistant. He needed a right-hand man, and he expected results from Billy Moto. Yes, Kurisaka was willing to pay a million dollars, but he wouldn\u0027t hesitate to get what he wanted by less scrupulous means.\n Moto searched himself and wondered how far he\u0027d go to get Kurisaka what he wanted.\n The conversation with Billy Moto lingered in Kurisaka\u0027s mind, distracted him. He flipped on his hundred-inch, flat-screen television and put in the DVD of Pillow Talk, which always calmed him down and let him think. Doris Day\u0027s voice was like creamy butter.\n But he barely watched the film, was hardly aware of Doris Day at all. His mind raced. It should have been so simple. Kurisaka had sent Moto to America to expedite the purchase of the DiMaggio card. Why should there be complications? Unless... Unless... Something was going on behind his back. His old Yakuza instincts bubbled to the surface. Hito Hyatta had agents everywhere, men who labored to make Hyatta aware of rare and valuable collectibles that came on the market. And Kurisaka knew Hyatta\u0027s passion for their shared hobby. He knew Hyatta would spare no expense if he wanted the DiMaggio card for himself. Hyatta had practically admitted it at lunch. He was after a highly collectible card in Florida. What else could it be but the DiMaggio card?\n Kurisaka would not be thwarted again by Hyatta! He was tired of playing second fiddle to his rival. This time he would get the card and rub it in Hyatta\u0027s face. Let Hyatta sit and seethe with envy. This time Kurisaka would be the one to gloat over his new prize.\n But Billy Moto was usually very competent. Moto\u0027s lack of progress was most troubling. Could it be... no... was it possible that Moto would betray him? Had Hyatta gotten to Moto, made him a better offer for retrieving the card? Yes, of course it was possible. Anyone could be bribed or threatened. A lesson from Kurisaka\u0027s Yakuza days he\u0027d almost forgotten. Kurisaka had become complacent. He felt ashamed and lost. As a Yakuza boss he\u0027d been feared and respected. As a legitimate businessman he was mocked and ridiculed. Men like Hyatta laughed behind his back. Damn them! Damn them all. He would show them. He would not be toyed with. He would-\n A red flashing beacon in the corner of the TV screen and a harsh beep made Kurisaka jump. Kurisaka thumbed the remote, paused the film, and the face of one of his employees filled the screen.\n \"Mr. Kurisaka, there\u0027s been another attempt on your life.\"\n Kurisaka raised an eyebrow. \"Tell me.\"\n \"A man outside your offices. A routine security screening found he had a bomb. We think he was going to try to sneak in disguised as a custodial worker. Probably plant the bomb in your office. Shall we turn him over to Tokyo Police?\"\n \"No. Question him. Find out who hired him.\"\n \"It shall be done. But if he proves as resistant to interrogation as the others...\"\n \"Make sure no remains are found.\" He had not completely forgotten the Yakuza ways.\n \"Hai.\" The man\u0027s face disappeared from the screen.\n Enemies. All around him there were enemies. Enemies and traitors. Kurisaka needed someone he could trust. No one in his current organization would suffice. He needed somebody from the old days. He picked up his phone, dialed a number he knew by heart.\n \"Hello?\"\n \"Cousin Toshi,\" Kurisaka said. \"It has been too long. How would you like to go to America?\"\n Joellen Becker had opened her mouth and puked lies until she\u0027d convinced Billy Moto she practically had Teddy Folger in her back pocket.\n Moto\u0027s call to her office had intrigued her. She\u0027d done a very specific Internet search. You can find some surprising information on the Web if you know where to look and how to read between the lines. An hour on Mercenary.com and a visit to Bountyhunterand-rewards.com confirmed her suspicions. She also made several calls to some folks she knew from her old NSA days.\n Her investigation had turned up a few interesting things about the billionaire Ahira Kurisaka. Things she could exploit although she would need to first confirm a few details. Later.\n After dinner, she went home and opened the gun chest in the bedroom closet, took out the Smith \u0026 Wesson.380 auto and two extra clips, snapped them into the lightweight nylon shoulder holster. She did not delve into the metal chests containing her array of special equipment. Keepsakes from her government days.\n Becker had names and addresses and some other good information from Folger\u0027s file, including where the man\u0027s ex-wife lived. She\u0027d go to the man\u0027s places, follow the trail, sniff him out. She was an investigator. This was her specialty.\n She shrugged into the holster rig, snapped it tight. She strapped the.25 automatic to her ankle. A million bucks for a baseball card? Yes, that was a lot of money. But to Joellen Becker, the card was merely bait for a much bigger fish.\n 8\n When early man had formed the notion of real estate, it had been decided by all involved that land near water would be more expensive. A lot more expensive.\n Still, oceanfront property wasn\u0027t always a good idea. Every few years a grumpy hurricane shuffled through Pensacola and kicked over all the beachfront houses. People rebuilt. Insurance rates soared, but snowbirds and carpetbaggers flocked to the sunny coast, bought up the beachfront property, then the beach-access property, plunked down big wads of cash into cookie-cutter time-shares. Or they bought houses on canals that in turn led to the sea.\n Anything to be on or near or in view of the ocean.\n Conner figured Teddy Folger had caught on late. Folger\u0027s sad plot of land was on a narrow canal which connected to a small river that emptied into a bay which opened into the Gulf of Mexico. It wasn\u0027t much, but it was there, the distant connection to wide-open seas. Maybe Teddy could even feel it, standing on his back porch with a beer in his fist. Maybe he looked at the muddy dribble of a canal but felt and heard the salty roar of the ocean. Conner could only guess.\n Jenny Folger and Conner Samson watched the house and the sailboat from a rented canoe two hundred yards away. He looked through his new binoculars. No signs of life. The boat was squeezed into the canal pretty tight, less than two feet to spare on each side. There was a spacious, green backyard and then the bungalow. They\u0027d passed half a dozen houses after turning off the river. Then they\u0027d passed two construction sites. Then about a mile of empty lots, and they thought they had the wrong canal, but they rounded a bend and there it was. Teddy Folger\u0027s house was the very last one at the end of the canal, the sailboat backed in, stern away from them.\n Conner handed the binoculars to Jenny.\n \"That\u0027s it all right,\" she said. \"You can\u0027t see where it says Electric Jenny from here, but that\u0027s it.\"\n Jenny had changed into an American-flag bikini top and denim shorts. She was tan just short of leathery, breasts nearly overflowing the stars and stripes. Conner worried she\u0027d catch him sneaking peeks.\n He dipped the paddle into the water and began turning the canoe around.\n \"What are you doing?\" Jenny asked.\n \"Leaving.\"\n \"The boat\u0027s right there, for Christ\u0027s sake. Let\u0027s just get it.\"\n \"It\u0027ll be dark in a few hours. Does Teddy have a gun or anything? Is he violent?\"\n She bit her lower lip, looked back at the boat and the bungalow. \"Probably not.\"\n \"I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll risk it,\" Conner said. \"We\u0027ll come back when he\u0027s asleep, scull the boat out with a paddle or push it out with the boat hook. Then crank the engine and take off when we\u0027re a safe distance away.\"\n \"What if he leaves in the meantime?\"\n Good point. \"Okay. The bait place where we rented the canoe has a little motel. We\u0027ll get a room facing the water and keep watch. We\u0027ll get some sandwiches.\"\n They paddled back. (Actually, Conner noticed he did most of the paddling. Jenny rubbed suntan oil over her body.) He paid the rental guy to keep the canoe until the next morning. The motel rooms were not fancy. They\u0027d been designed for boaters and fishermen, and the motel\u0027s main feature was that it was right on the water. Conner paid the forty-eight bucks and went to the room while Jenny hit the bait shop.\n The room was clean but dismal, cheap wood paneling, two shabby chairs. Conner flipped on the air-conditioning, a small window unit, and it rattled and coughed out something akin to cool air. He pulled back the drapes so he could see the river. They were into the long days of summer, so even though it was past dinnertime, they still had a good two hours to kill until dark.\n Jenny knocked once, then walked in with a paper bag under her arm. She looked the room over. \"Not exactly the Plaza, is it?\"\n Yeah, but I\u0027m the one who paid for it. Conner sat on the bed and flipped on the TV, looking for a ball game. No cable. He switched it off. The money Derrick James had given him was running low. He was glad they\u0027d found the sailboat. Conner reluctantly admitted he owed Jenny some gratitude. He didn\u0027t admit it out loud.\n She pulled a six-pack of Bud and two sandwiches out of the bag. \"Not much of a selection. Egg salad or tuna salad.\"\n \"I\u0027ll take the tuna.\"\n She frowned. \"There\u0027s also egg salad.\"\n \"Fine.\" Conner could take a hint.\n They chewed sandwiches, sipped beer, watched the window.\n The sun faded to dirty orange, and the boats made their way down the river-speedboats, party barges, and the occasional sailboat. Some pulled into the bait shop for gas or a last-minute six-pack. College kids, families, old men buying bait for night fishing.\n Some boats were coming up the river, back to waterfront homes after a long day of fishing. There weren\u0027t many sailboats. They all had to get in before the County Road 25 bridge-\n \"Aw, crap,\" Conner said.\n Jenny looked up from her beer. \"What?\"\n \"The bridge,\" he said. \"The operator knocks off at seven. We won\u0027t be able to get past it until morning. The Jenny\u0027s mast is too tall.\" It was one of those old, swing-to-the-side bridges that hadn\u0027t quite fallen apart yet. Sooner or later the county would probably hand it over to the state, then the state would tear it down and build a higher bridge so the boats could fit underneath. Conner cursed himself for forgetting about the damn bridge.\n Jenny said, \"I told you we should have done it while we were there.\"\n \"Shut up a second and let me think.\"\n She pouted, lit a cigarette.\n \"Here\u0027s what we do,\" Conner announced. \"We\u0027ll grab the Jenny tonight as planned, sail her downriver. There are a dozen places I can pull in, little branches and hidey-holes. We\u0027ll stash the boat, come back in a day or maybe two and get her then.\"\n \"Fine.\" She smoked, propped her feet up on the bed next to Conner. Her legs were tan and firm. She\u0027d unbuttoned the top of her denim shorts, the zipper halfway down.\n She might\u0027ve caught Conner looking again, so he decided to start some conversation.\n \"So...\" That was about all he had.\n \"You look in shape,\" she said. \"You work out?\"\n \"I used to play a little ball.\"\n \"I go to the gym almost every day,\" she said. \"That\u0027s one of the reasons I\u0027m so pissed. I kept in good shape, you know? He didn\u0027t need another girl.\"\n \"It doesn\u0027t work that way,\" Conner said. \"That\u0027s not how men decide things about women.\"\n \"How do men decide?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know, but not like that.\"\n She lifted one of her legs. \"Feel that calf. It\u0027s as good as a twenty-year-old\u0027s.\"\n He took her ankle in one hand, felt her calf with the other. Taut. Good tone. \"Nice.\"\n \"Damn right.\" She swigged beer, stood up, and shimmied out of her shorts. She wore the bottom half of the American-flag bikini underneath, cut high on the hips. \"The good thing about the bridge being closed is we don\u0027t have to keep watch.\" She turned to close the curtains, showed Conner the backside of her bikini, a thong. Firm and tan all over.\n Conner began feeling a little twitchy.\n She came back to him on the bed, straddled him. She rubbed his places. He rubbed her places in return. Then their places started bumping against one another. She peeled Conner out of his clothes. He untied her bikini top. Tan lines, stark white triangles around pink nipples.\n Conner thought of Tyranny, how she kept working him into a frenzy until he was crazy, then pulling away, leaving him hot and bothered. So he swung Jenny underneath him, entered her hard, pounded, fucking her angry, her grunts and moans working into a steady rhythm, her nails digging into his back, ankles locked behind his knees. Conner clenched his teeth as he thrust. Like it was some kind of punishment.\n She squealed, and Conner was right behind her. They collapsed into a pile of sweat and beer breath and coconut oil.\n After, they lay there under the sheets in the dark, both awake but not talking.\n Finally, she asked, \"Was that... did you like it?\"\n \"Of course.\" He might not have liked it the way she wanted him to, maybe it wasn\u0027t so much to do with her, but he\u0027d needed it.\n \"Then why-\" Her voice caught. \"I thought I hated Teddy so much. I thought... what did I do wrong? Why did this happen?\"\n Conner thought she might be crying, but in the dark, he wasn\u0027t sure. He tried to think of something to say, but nothing seemed helpful, so he moved in close, draped an arm over her. Soon her breathing was easy and regular like she was asleep. Then he drifted off too. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/suicide-squeeze/page-7.html","bookId":2245,"book":{"id":2245,"title":"Suicide Squeeze","description":"Storyline: \n The Edgar Award-nominated author of \"Gun Monkeys\" delivers an adrenaline rush of a novel that features a special appearance by Joe DiMaggio. \n The high spot of Teddy Folger\u0027s life was the day in 1954 that he got an autographed baseball card from Joe DiMaggio himself.
