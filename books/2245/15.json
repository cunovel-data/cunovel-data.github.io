Pete didn\u0027t say much, but his little rat eyes were always moving. Conner carried the Jasper Dybek paintings under his arms. Pete took Conner to Rocky\u0027s office door and left him. Conner knocked with the toe of his shoe. His arms were full of abstraction. \"Come in.\" Conner juggled the paintings until he could get a hand on the knob, turned it, went inside. \"Hello, Rocky.\" Rocky squinted at Conner, looked at the paintings, raised a curious eyebrow. \"Well, what\u0027s this then?\" \"An offer.\" Rocky motioned Conner to the empty seat across from him. Conner sat, leaned the paintings against Rocky\u0027s desk. He was a little nervous about this, didn\u0027t quite know if Rocky would go for it. Today, Rocky wore a dark gray suit, obscenely bright floral tie. He spread his hands, indicated Conner should look at the item on his desk. \"I\u0027m trying to figure this thing out.\" Conner looked. A plastic fish on a wooden plaque. Rocky snapped his fingers near the fish\u0027s head. The fish sprang to life, body twisting, mouth opening and closing to the mechanical sounds of \"Don\u0027t Worry, Be Happy.\" It sang a few lines, then went still again. \"What exactly do people do with these?\" Rocky asked. \"You\u0027ve never seen those?\" Conner said. \"It\u0027s a singing bass, a very annoying novelty that was a trend about a million years ago.\" Rocky sighed. \"And we have an entire truckload.\" Rocky tossed it over his shoulder, and it landed in a pile of junk behind him. \"So, let\u0027s hear your offer.\" Conner put the paintings on his desk. \"These are worth a lot more than two thousand.\" \"What are they?\" \"Paintings.\" \"I can see that,\" Rocky said. \"Specifics.\" \"By a guy named Jasper Dybek. He\u0027s getting famous. His last painting went for nearly twenty thousand dollars.\" Rocky looked embarrassed. \"I don\u0027t usually take items in barter.\" \"There\u0027s like sixty grand worth of art here.\" Rocky considered, picked up the phone. \"Julie? Get me Burt Rosenthal at Sotheby\u0027s. Yes, I\u0027ll wait.\" He put his hand over the phone. \"Only because Otis vouches for you. I really am becoming a ridiculous softy. Sometimes I think- Hello, Burt? Yes, it\u0027s Rocky. How\u0027s your boy? He still at New Haven? That\u0027s grand, really. Super. Listen, I\u0027m calling about the usual. You know what I mean. Uh-huh. I know it takes time. No problem. Three abstracts by an artist named-\" Rocky looked at Conner, raised an eyebrow. \"Jasper Dybek.\" \"-Jasper Dybek,\" Rocky said into the phone. \"Yes, it does look like some sloppy work. I\u0027ve never been a fan of abstract myself. Can we move them? Uh-huh. Right. No, that\u0027s good for now. Call me later with the details. Thanks, Burt.\" He hung up. Rocky sighed. \"Okay, I\u0027ll take them.\" Conner clapped his hands. \"Thanks, Rocky. You won\u0027t regret it. What\u0027s my cut?\" \"Your cut of what?\" \"That\u0027s sixty thousand dollars worth of art!\" Conner\u0027s voice had leapt up an octave. \"We\u0027re square.\" Rocky\u0027s voice was flat, a warning tone. \"But-\" \"Conner, these are original paintings, not DVD players. You can\u0027t put them through a legit auction. That means we have to find a private collector or somebody in Europe or somewhere to buy them. Burt will take a cut, and the fellow down the line will take a cut, and maybe they won\u0027t sell for a year or two or maybe never. I\u0027ll probably lose money on the whole deal. Do you understand?\" Conner nodded. \"Yeah. Sorry, Rocky.\" \"Don\u0027t pout,\" Rocky said. At least Conner\u0027s slate was clean, and right now that was no small thing. Conner Samson walked out of Playerz, climbed behind the wheel of the Plymouth Fury, and put plan B into motion. Planet X was a small shop in a plaza on the navy base side of town, wedged in between a pizza joint and a computer store. Conner walked in with the binder full of baseball cards. The owner of Planet X had gone all the way. Models of spaceships and dragons hung from the ceiling on fishing line. Life-size cardboard cutouts of Batman, Green Lantern, Spider-Man, and the Punisher. Movie posters on the walls, Star Wars, Blade Runner, and others. Conner moved around a big display of Dungeons \u0026 Dragons accessories to look at a display inside a glass dome. It was a model of a castle under siege, lead figurines with swords and spears assaulting the defenders along the castle walls. The figurines had been painted with excruciating detail. Even dabs of red blood on the tips of the spears. Somebody had a lot of time on his hands. Conner bypassed several shelves of sci-fi and fantasy novels, Star Trek toys, and found what he was looking for. A long glass case filled with baseball cards. They ranged in price from $1.50 to $125.00. Conner put the binder on the counter, flipped through it, and wondered what he could get for them. \"Conner?\" Conner turned. \"Hi, Randy.\" Randy Frankowski looked just as awkward in denim shorts and a Wookie Anti-Defamation League T-shirt as he did in a tuxedo, but the kid seemed happy and comfortable, in his element with the Star Trek collectibles and comic books and sci-fi stuff all around. \"Did you hear about the Dybeks?\" Randy said. \"Somebody stole them. Can you believe it? Right in the middle of the reception. Professor Dan was livid.\" \"Wow. Do they know who did it?\" Randy shook his head. \"Not that I\u0027ve heard. The cops crawled all over the place looking for clues or whatever, but last I heard they were stumped.\" Good. \"I really didn\u0027t expect you to come in here,\" Randy said. \"You didn\u0027t seem like a comic-book sort of guy. Unless you want to start reading The Incredible Hulk again. We have the latest issue.\" \"Do you guys buy baseball cards?\" Conner asked. Randy pointed to a poster on the wall. It depicted a triple-breasted, green woman riding a unicorn and wielding a flaming whip. \"That\u0027s one of mine over there. I drew it and went to this place and had a hundred posters run off. We sell them here in the store, and I\u0027ve sold like eight or nine already. That\u0027s pretty cool, huh?\" \"Focus, Randy. I asked about baseball cards.\" Randy looked at the binder, nodded. \"Ah. You want to unload the collection, huh?\" \"I could use some cash.\" \"The boss set up two standard methods,\" Randy said. \"First, we can sell them on consignment. We\u0027ll put them on display with whatever price you want, and when they sell, Planet X gets 15 percent. You get more money that way, but it\u0027s a slow sort of system.\" He pointed at a card in the case. \"That Wade Boggs has been in the case a year. I could have sold it ten times, but the owner won\u0027t come down on the price.\" \"I don\u0027t have time for that.\" \"The other way, Planet X buys the cards from you outright, but only at half the Price Guide value.\" \"That\u0027s good.\" Conner tapped the binder. \"Let\u0027s do it.\" \"Are you sure?\" Randy asked. \"You lose a lot of the value that way.\" \"Start adding them up.\" Randy shrugged, went around the other side of the counter, and pulled out the Price Guide. Randy went through the binder, finding the prices in the guide, writing the numbers in a long column on a legal pad. Selling Folger\u0027s old cards wouldn\u0027t be enough to get out of town, but it might carry him awhile. Conner thought he might have to sell the Plymouth Fury. It was in good shape, mostly original parts. One of the custom shops could probably turn it into a classic show car. But Conner knew he wouldn\u0027t get good money. As with the cards, he would want to unload the Plymouth in a hurry. What he really needed was the ten grand from the DiMaggio card, but he didn\u0027t know where it was. Maybe Randy knew something that could point Conner in the right direction. After seeing the prices on the cards here at Planet X, it was difficult to believe a card could be worth so much, even to a rabid collector. A few hundred bucks was a lot, sure. Twenty thousand was a whole different ballpark. \"How much more valuable is a card if it\u0027s autographed?\" Randy looked up from the Price Guide. \"Depends on the card, I guess.\" \"As much as twenty thousand dollars?\" Randy wasn\u0027t shocked by the number. \"Sure. Still depends on who the player is, though.\" \"How about Joe DiMaggio?\" Conner said. \"Oh, you\u0027re talking about Teddy Folger\u0027s card, huh? Yeah, that\u0027s an expensive one for sure.\" \"You know about it?\" \"Everyone knows about it. Everyone in the business anyway. I heard it burned up with Folger\u0027s shop. Too bad. Jerry was bummed out for a week when he heard.\" \"Who\u0027s Jerry?\" \"He\u0027s the card guy here at Planet X. I\u0027m more of a comics guy, but Jerry knows cards like it was his religion. He could tell you every detail about the DiMaggio card, what it\u0027s worth, all that.\" \"When does he come in?\" \"He\u0027s at the Other Worlds Sci-Fi, Comics \u0026 Collectibles Convention in Montgomery and won\u0027t be back until next week.\" Hell. Randy said, \"I tallied up all the cards. Looks like $810. Half of that is $405. That okay?\" \"Yeah,\" Conner said. \"Is there anyone else I can ask about the DiMaggio card? I\u0027m curious.\" \"You could ask Teddy Folger about it, I guess.\" I could ask. I wouldn\u0027t get any answers. Randy went to the register and came back with $405, handed it to Conner. \"I\u0027m going up to the convention tomorrow with a load of comics. I\u0027m trying to sell a set of Frank Miller Daredevils in mint condition. I\u0027m talking totally original, not one of the Marvel reprints.\" When Randy said this, Conner heard, blah blah blah blah blah. \"Uh-huh.\" \"If you still want to talk to Jerry, you can ride up with me.\" Conner would rather hit himself in the face with a hammer, but he wanted to know about the DiMaggio card, its value, any small scrap of information that might help. This Jerry might know what sort of person would pay so much for a card, maybe even provide a list of buyers should Conner actually get his hands on the card. \"When?\" \"In the morning about nine A.M. We\u0027ll have fun. I usually pack a cooler full of sodas and sandwiches for the trip.\" \"How much does this cost?\" Randy said, \"If you pay ahead of time, it\u0027s cheaper. At the door, it\u0027s going to be twenty dollars to get in, I think.\" Twenty bucks. Possibly worth the investment. Randy interpreted the hesitation on Conner\u0027s face as reluctance. He snapped his fingers. \"I know how to get you in for free.\" \"Yeah?\" \"Leave it to me.\" \"Okay.\" Why not? \"One more thing. I should really warn you about Jerry. Some people think he\u0027s a bit strange. He\u0027s really an okay guy, but he\u0027s kind of a nerd,\" Randy said.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/suicide-squeeze/page-15.html","bookId":2245,"book":{"id":2245,"title":"Suicide Squeeze","description":"Storyline: The Edgar Award-nominated author of \"Gun Monkeys\" delivers an adrenaline rush of a novel that features a special appearance by Joe DiMaggio.
