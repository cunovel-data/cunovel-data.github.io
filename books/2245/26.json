{"id":85386,"no":26,"title":"Page 26","content":"46 Conner awoke on cool, clean sheets. His shirt and shoes off, gauze and surgical tape on his slashed forearm. He lifted his head, looked around the room. The Kevlar vest and Batman utility belt sat on the chair in the corner, the metal attach¨¦ case leaned against a leg of the chair. His entire body ached. He remembered. Tyranny\u0027s house. It must be a guest room. Conner took in his surroundings, dark wood paneling, plaid bedcovers. A wooden duck on the nightstand. Some kind of L.L. Bean nightmare. The hazy early-morning light seeped in through the open drapes. Barely after dawn. Clouds on the horizon, thunderstorms later in the afternoon, Conner predicted. Good. Maybe they\u0027d cool things off. Tyranny entered the room, sat on the side of the bed, put a hand on Conner\u0027s good arm. \"Thank you.\" \"For what?\" \"For not dying in my lap, you asshole. I really didn\u0027t need a funeral with me all sobbing and snotty and red-eyed. Anyway, you were mostly just shocked and exhausted. The cut on your arm isn\u0027t very deep. Dan wanted to call an ambulance. Or the police.\" \"You stopped him?\" She nodded. \"Thanks.\" Conner looked at her fingernails, her lips. \"It wasn\u0027t a dream then.\" \"Huh?\" \"I dreamed you were a zombie,\" Conner said. \"Like in Dawn of the Dead.\" \"Fuck you.\" But there wasn\u0027t much venom in it. She lightly stroked his bandage. \"Conner, what happened? I saw something about terrorists on TV.\" He shook his head. \"I don\u0027t have anything to do with terrorists. I... well, I was in on this deal. The details aren\u0027t important.\" He sat up in bed, winced at his protesting muscles. \"I\u0027m going to have some money.\" Without Rocky or Becker, Conner wasn\u0027t sure how he\u0027d go about selling the card. \"I need to work out the particulars, but I thought... I know you were mad at me before, but-\" \"Would you stop acting like money is such a big deal. Just shut up about it.\" \"Why don\u0027t you love me?\" \"Idiot!\" Tyranny balled her little fists, beat the mattress. \"It took you ten seconds to open your mouth and ruin it.\" A long silence. \"So I\u0027m just... I\u0027m just...\" Conner\u0027s voice shook. He was having trouble keeping it together. \"I\u0027m just another one of your...\" She shook her head, closed her eyes so tight. \"It wasn\u0027t supposed to be like that. In the pool house, I thought...\" She exhaled, shoulders and arms going limp, all the coiled anger in her leaking out in a sad puff of defeat. \"Did I tell you about when I went to the Louvre in Paris?\" \"With Dan?\" \"No,\" she snapped. \"I mean yes, we went together, but that\u0027s not the point. Will you listen and shut the fuck up?\" Conner shut the fuck up. \"I went to see The Mona Lisa. Have you seen it? I mean on television or in a book, how they have it displayed?\" She knew he hadn\u0027t traveled. \"I know the picture. Not anything else.\" \"It\u0027s behind glass,\" Tyranny said. \"And you have to stand way back behind a velvet rope to see it. I mean, here I am, this artist, right? And there\u0027s a giant museum full of a million different paintings, no velvet rope, no glass. I could get right up close and check out the brushstrokes. But all I want to do is stand twenty feet away and look at The Mona Lisa. I stood there for over an hour, just thinking, Wow that\u0027s the famous painting. \"That\u0027s how you were to me, Conner,\" Tyranny said. \"Special. Behind the protective glass. If I just kept our relationship at a certain level, then it wouldn\u0027t be ruined. That\u0027s what I thought. Funny, isn\u0027t it? You were my longest-running act of restraint, and I blew it. I didn\u0027t want to fuck you and make you part of my sickness. I wanted you separate from that. I messed it up.\" \"You didn\u0027t mess it up,\" Conner said. \"It\u0027s okay.\" \"It\u0027s not okay. In my mind, it\u0027s all messed up and ruined, and my mind is where the problem is. No, Conner, we\u0027re broken. I broke us. And the only thing that can fix us-if we can be fixed-is time and distance. I have to put you back behind the glass and the velvet rope. And that\u0027s the best I can explain it. If you still can\u0027t understand or won\u0027t understand, then I can only say please please please trust that I know what\u0027s best for myself.\" \"Tell me what Dan does. I\u0027ll do the same thing. I won\u0027t ask questions. I\u0027ll stay out of your business.\" \"No. You\u0027ll end up hating me. Or you\u0027ll drive me crazy, and I\u0027ll kill you.\" Conner shook his head, eyes fogging. \"Then that\u0027s it. I\u0027m just supposed to understand. I\u0027m just supposed to go away.\" Tyranny nodded once slowly, watching with big, deep eyes. \"You\u0027re just supposed to go away.\" Conner stood, reached for his clothes. \"I have to get out of here.\" \"Are you okay? Your arm.\" \"I don\u0027t even feel it,\" Conner said. He put on his shirt, grabbed the vest and the belt, looked around the room for anything else. He didn\u0027t want to leave anything behind. He resolved in that instant to sail away on the Jenny, become a wandering boat bum, port to port, hugging the coast around the Gulf and down to the Keys, tie up at some island and become a hermit. Or Mexico. Isn\u0027t that where rogues went to start over? Maybe Conner would grow a moustache, take up with a sixteen-year-old Mexican girl. Drink tequila and brood, and the locals would know him as the crazy gringo with secrets. There was a whole world of tragic possibilities to choose from, and Conner wanted to get started. I\u0027m so goddamned dramatic. Conner opened the attach¨¦ case, took out the DiMaggio card, and put it in his pocket. It fit snugly, the plastic case making an awkward bulge. He dropped the attach¨¦ case. \"I\u0027ll leave that here, if you don\u0027t mind. I\u0027m tired of lugging it around.\" Tyranny didn\u0027t say anything, looked at her toes. Conner left the bedroom without another word. She followed him down the stairs, out the front door to the yellow Lincoln. \"Conner.\" He ignored her, opened the car door, threw the vest and belt into the backseat. \"Conner, don\u0027t be angry.\" She put her hand on his back. He flinched from her. \"Don\u0027t touch me. I hate you. You suck, and you\u0027re ugly.\" \"Okay,\" Tyranny said. \"You can say that if you need to.\" \"Go to hell.\" He got behind the wheel, cranked the engine. It was sinking in now, everything she\u0027d said. Conner could not do anything, say anything, be anything that would make any difference. That he could have so little control over something so important to him hit him harder than anything else that had happened. Even Otis\u0027s death. Conner felt feeble and stupid and small. Nothing he\u0027d done had changed anything about him. He looked at Tyranny, then over her shoulder at the house. The blinds pried apart in an upstairs window, Professor Dan watching the big breakup scene. \"I love you,\" Tyranny said. \"I just want you to know that. You have to go away, but I love you.\" Conner pulled the door closed, drove away. Just like Joe DiMaggio, Conner thought, the ballplayer in love with the mysterious woman. He tried to convince himself that somewhere inside Tyranny was a persona it was okay for him to love. Or maybe he only loved the woman he thought she was. But he couldn\u0027t convince himself, knew it simply wasn\u0027t true. He was in love with all of her, the warped and wretched parts too, the funny little buttons in her brain that needed pressing over and over again so she could feel whatever it was she needed to feel. And anyway, Conner made for a pretty cheap DiMaggio. The long curves of Scenic Highway unfolded before him, the morning sun muted by the rolling gray, the sky promising a trademark Florida thunderstorm. It would build and build until the sky opened and drowned everything, not out of malice, not spite, but only because the sky would be too full to hold it all. But Conner didn\u0027t see the sky. His eyes felt so hot. He sniffed, wiped his nose on the bottom of his shirt. What in God\u0027s ugly world would make the pain in his chest go away? 47 It took three hours for Conner to flag down a boat willing to tie onto one of the Jenny\u0027s stern cleats and pull her off the sandbar. With the sky growing blacker by the hour, there weren\u0027t many boats on the river. The Boston Whaler, which had pulled Conner off the sandbar, was captained by an ex-navy chief with a Papa Hemingway beard and fading tattoos. \"Better find some cover,\" he told Conner. \"Weather service says a bad one is coming.\" \"I hear you.\" Conner thanked him, made sure the Jenny was secure, and cranked the inboards. It had taken a few hours to find an appropriate marina and get organized. He figured another three hours for the trip. Downstream, under the swing-out bridge to the mouth of the river where it emptied into the Gulf. Then west along the coast to Paradise Marina almost in Alabama, the closest place to take on fuel and outfit the Jenny for Conner\u0027s escape. After leaving Tyranny, he\u0027d parked Otis\u0027s Lincoln at the marina, the trunk full of expensive goods Conner planned to pawn. He thought about selling the Lincoln too but didn\u0027t want to invest the time and money in finding the right people to forge a registration and fence the vehicle. Then Conner found the leather doctor\u0027s bag in the backseat. He\u0027d opened the bag slowly, afraid the money would vanish in a poof of bad karma. Conner couldn\u0027t really feel like the money was his, but who else could claim it? He counted it. Enough. More than enough to get him and the Jenny to a faraway place where he could forget who he was, decide who he wanted to be. Conner had then taken an expensive cab ride from the marina back to the sailboat. He kept checking his pocket for the DiMaggio card. He didn\u0027t plan to let it out of his sight anytime soon. Somewhere there had to be a buyer for the damn thing. At the wheel, he eased the throttle forward, eyed the sky. He might just be able to reach the marina before nightfall. If he were lucky. The weather restrained itself as Conner made it past the swing-out bridge. The guy in the bridge keeper\u0027s house leaned out the little window and gave him a wave. At the mouth of the river, the rain started coming heavier, the water a rough, foamy chop, the prow of the Jenny slamming into big waves as it motored forward. Conner was in the Gulf now, and the spray stinging his face was salty and cold. Between the rain and the waves the cockpit filled shin deep with water. He hit the switch for the pumps. They chugged to life below the deck, just keeping ahead of the water coming in. The sky was completely black with storm clouds now, the Gulf a steel blue. Lightning crisscrossed the sky. Conner kept the coastline within a half mile. He flipped on the running lights. He was getting worried. The storm had slowed his progress, the sailboat\u0027s engine struggling against the severe chop. Conner was a decent sailor, but all of his experience had been pleasure boating on calm seas. And then the engines sputtered and died. Oh... shit. Conner thumbed the ignition. It wouldn\u0027t turn over. He checked the fuel gauge. The tanks were bone dry. Oh, no. No, no, no... He hadn\u0027t calculated the rough seas, the extra fuel consumption. Without forward momentum, the boat would flounder. He left the cockpit, pulled himself forward so he could get the sails up. A wave almost washed him over. He threw himself at the mast, hung on as the Jenny listed badly, pitched the deck almost ninety degrees. The rain pounded him now in driving sheets. He could no longer see the prow. Water coming over the transom. Conner fought his way back to the cockpit, threw open one of the bench seats, and grabbed a life jacket. The wind howled, and the Jenny threatened to roll. Conner turned his head side to side. He\u0027d lost track of the land. It was totally black now. He was going to drown. He was going to die in the ocean. In a flash of lightning, Conner glimpsed a twelve-foot wave coming hard. It collided in the darkness. Conner was thrown, blind. Then he was underwater. He struggled, kicked, hit the surface, and gulped air. The sea churned around him. Fifty yards distant, he thought he saw the Jenny\u0027s white fiberglass bottom. The boat had rolled. Another wave drove him under, and when he came back up again he no longer saw the boat. He didn\u0027t know where the coast lay. The heaving black ocean gaped in all directions, immense swells briefly visible in the lightning. To come all this way. To die like this. Nobody even knew where he was. Nobody would ever know. Typical, thought Conner. Just fucking typical. 48 The side of Conner\u0027s face burned. Bright and hot, the morning sun beat down on Conner as he lay in the sand. He rolled over, groaned. He\u0027d fought the sea for an eternity, stroking in what he\u0027d prayed was the direction toward shore. And just when he\u0027d been about to give up, exhausted, ready to surrender to watery doom, his feet had hit the sandy bottom. Ahead of him, through rain, lights. He\u0027d found the beach and collapsed. Now he sat up, found himself in front of a row of condominiums. An old couple sat on their veranda, the old woman bringing her old man a glass of orange juice. The old man waved at Conner. Conner waved back. He stood, brushed the sand off his pants and shirt, and scanned the Gulf for any sign of the Jenny. Nothing. Not even debris. The Electric Jenny wasn\u0027t Folger\u0027s anymore, nor Conner\u0027s either. It belonged to Davy Jones. And somewhere on the sandy bottom was Rocky Big\u0027s doctor bag full of money. God\u0027s final joke on Conner Samson, cut off his escape route. It\u0027s biblical, the old Job gag. Torment the little guy. What\u0027s next? Boils? In a sudden panic, Conner checked his pockets. The DiMaggio card was still there, safe and secure in its plastic case. He also still had the cell phone Rocky had given him. Who was there to call? He grasped the phone tightly, reared back, arm way behind him, gathering the strength to hurl it into the Gulf of Mexico. He\u0027d throw it over the horizon if he could. It rang. Conner froze, unsure if he\u0027d heard what he thought he\u0027d heard. It rang again. He unfolded it slowly, pressed the TALK button. \"Hello?\" \"Conner, thank God you\u0027re there.\" Tyranny. He\u0027d forgotten he\u0027d given her the cell number, had desperately hoped she\u0027d call. \"If you called to apologize, it\u0027s too late. I\u0027ve moved on. I\u0027m actually having a lovely time at the beach right now. Getting a suntan.\" \"Conner, this is very important.\" Something in her voice. Strangely calm, unnerving. \"What\u0027s wrong?\" Conner asked. \"There are some men here,\" Tyranny said. \"They say you have something that belongs to them. They told me to call you.\" Conner\u0027s chest tightened. \"Asians?\" \"Yes, that\u0027s right. They\u0027re very serious. They said it could be bad for me if you don\u0027t cooperate.\" \"What am I supposed to do?\" \"They want you to come here immediately. I\u0027m at home. Bring what they want and nobody gets hurt. Dan\u0027s not here right now. I\u0027d like, if possible, to resolve this situation before he gets home.\" She said it like she was ordering a pizza, no tears, no panic, but Conner detected a hint of strain in her voice. She was trying to maintain, not show how terrified she was for herself and for Dan should he come home and walk into the middle of things. Conner looked up and down the beach, tried to estimate where he was. The marina might be within walking distance. The Lincoln was there. \"I need some time. I\u0027m sort of stuck. But I\u0027ll be there.\" \"Don\u0027t dawdle.\" \"Tell them to wait,\" Conner said. \"I\u0027m coming. I have to get to the car, but tell them I\u0027m coming.\" \"I\u0027ll tell them.\" Conner hung up, jogged up the beach, through the condo complex, and found the main road. He recognized where he was now. The marina was only three or four miles away. God wasn\u0027t punishing him, Conner thought. He\u0027s just letting me know I have unfinished business. Responsibilities. Conner ran, every sore muscle screaming for him to stop. He ran and ran and told his muscles to shut the hell up.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/suicide-squeeze/page-26.html","bookId":2245,"book":{"id":2245,"title":"Suicide Squeeze","description":"Storyline: The Edgar Award-nominated author of \"Gun Monkeys\" delivers an adrenaline rush of a novel that features a special appearance by Joe DiMaggio.
