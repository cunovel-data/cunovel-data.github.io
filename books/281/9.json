{"id":8560,"no":9,"title":"CHAPTER IX. KIT MAKES A NEW ACQUAINTANCE.","content":"Grafton, where Barlow\u0027s circus was billed to appear on Saturday, was only six miles farther on. Oakford was about half way, so that in accompanying the blacksmith to his home, Kit had accomplished about half the necessary journey. Now that he had undeceived the blacksmith as to his intention of staying he felt at ease in his mind. It was his plan to remain over night in the house and pursue his journey early the next day. \"Are these all the clo\u0027es you brought with you?\" asked Bickford, surveying Kit\u0027s neat and rather expensive suit with disapproval. \"Yes. Am I not well enough dressed for a blacksmith?\" asked Kit, with a smile.[Pg 45] \"You\u0027re a plaguy sight too well dressed,\" returned Bickford. \"You want a good rough suit, for the forge is a dirty place.\" \"I thought I told you I did not intend to work for you, Mr. Bickford.\" \"That\u0027s what you said, but I don\u0027t take no stock in it. Your uncle has bound you out to me, and that settles it.\" \"If he has bound me out, where are the papers, Mr. Bickford?\" asked Kit, keenly. This question was a poser. The blacksmith supposed that Kit might be ignorant that papers were required, but he found himself mistaken. \"There ain\u0027t no papers, but that don\u0027t make no difference,\" he said. \"He says you\u0027re to work for me, and I\u0027m goin\u0027 to hold you to it.\" Kit did not reply, for he saw no advantage in discussion. \"You\u0027ll get a dollar a week and your board, and you can\u0027t do better. I reckon dinner is about ready now.\" Kit felt ready for the dinner, for the morning\u0027s ride had sharpened his appetite. So when, five minutes later, he was summoned to the table, he willingly accepted the invitation. \"This is my new \u0027prentice, Mrs. Bickford,\" said the blacksmith, by way of introduction, to a spare, red headed woman, who was bustling about the kitchen, where the table was spread. Mrs. Bickford eyed Kit critically. \"He\u0027s one of the kid glove kind, by his looks,\" she said. \"You don\u0027t expect to get much work out of him, do you?\" \"I reckon I will, or know the reason why,\" responded Bickford, significantly.[Pg 46] \"Set right down and I\u0027ll dish up the victuals,\" said Mrs. Bickford. \"We don\u0027t stand on no ceremony here. What\u0027s your name, young man?\" \"People call me Kit.\" \"Sounds like a young cat. It\u0027s rediculous to give a boy such a name. First thing you know I\u0027ll be calling you Kitty.\" \"I hope I don\u0027t look like a cat,\" said Kit laughing. \"You ain\u0027t got no fur on your cheeks yet,\" said the blacksmith, laughing heartily at his own witticism. \"What have you got for dinner, mother?\" \"It\u0027s a sort of picked-up dinner,\" answered Mrs. Bickford. \"There\u0027s some pork and beans warmed up, some slapjacks from breakfast, and some fried sassidges.\" \"Why, that\u0027s a dinner for a king,\" said the blacksmith, rubbing his hands. He took his seat, and put on a plate for Kit specimens of the delicacies mentioned above. In spite of his appetite Kit partook sparingly, supplementing his meal with bread, which, being from the baker\u0027s shop, was of good quality. He congratulated himself that he was not to board permanently at Mr. Bickford\u0027s table. When dinner was over, the blacksmith in a genial mood said to Kit: \"You needn\u0027t begin to work till to-morrow. You can tramp round the village if you want to.\" Kit was glad of the delay, as early the next morning he expected to bid farewell to Oakford, and thus would avoid a conflict. He had been in Oakford before, and knew his way about. He went out of the yard and walked about in a leisurely way. It was early in June, and the[Pg 47] country was at its best. The birds were singing, the fields were green with verdure, and Kit\u0027s spirits rose. He felt that it would be delightful to travel about the country, as he would do if he joined Barlow\u0027s Circus. He overtook a boy somewhat larger than himself, a stout, strong country boy, attired in a rough, coarse working suit. He was about to pass him, when the country boy called out, \"Hallo, you!\" \"Were you speaking to me?\" asked Kit, turning and looking back. \"Yes. Didn\u0027t I see you riding into town with Aaron Bickford?\" \"Yes.\" \"Are you going to work for him?\" \"That is what he expects,\" answered Kit diplomatically. He hesitated about confiding his plans to a stranger. \"Then I pity you.\" \"Why?\" \"I used to work for him.\" \"Did you?\" \"Yes, I stood it as long as I could.\" \"Then you didn\u0027t like it?\" \"I guess not.\" \"What was the trouble?\" \"Everything. He\u0027s a stingy old hunks, to begin with. I went to work for a dollar a week and board. If the board had been decent, it would have been something, but I\u0027d as soon board at the poorhouse.\" \"I have taken dinner there,\" said Kit, smiling. \"Did you like it?\" \"I have dined better. In fact I have seldom dined worse.\" \"What did the old woman give you?\"[Pg 48] Kit enumerated the articles composing the bill of fare. \"That\u0027s better than usual,\" said the new acquaintance. \"I suppose the dollar a week is all right,\" said Kit. \"Good enough if you can get it. It\u0027s about as easy to get blood out of a stone, as money out of old Bickford. Generally I had to wait ten days after the time before I could get the money.\" \"How is the work?\" \"Hard, and plenty of it. It\u0027s work early and work late, and if there isn\u0027t work at the forge, you\u0027ve got to help the old woman, by drawing water and doing chores. You don\u0027t live in Oakford, do you?\" \"No; I came from Smyrna.\" \"I thought not. Bickford can\u0027t get a boy to work for him here. What made you come? Couldn\u0027t you get a place at home?\" \"I didn\u0027t try.\" \"Well, you haven\u0027t done much in coming here.\" \"I begin to think so,\" Kit responded, with a smile. \"Hasn\u0027t the circus been in your town?\" \"Yes.\" \"I wanted to go, but I guess I\u0027ll manage to see it in Grafton. It shows there to-morrow.\" \"Are you going?\" asked Kit with interest. \"Yes; I shall walk. I\u0027ll start early and spend the day there.\" \"We may meet there.\" \"You don\u0027t expect to go, do you? Bickford won\u0027t let you off.\" Kit smiled. \"I don\u0027t think Mr. Bickford will have much to say about it,\" he said.[Pg 49] \"Are you going to hook jack?\" asked his new acquaintance. \"I didn\u0027t mean to tell you, but I will. I have made up my mind not to work for Mr. Bickford at all.\" \"Then why did you come here?\" \"Because my uncle saw fit to arrange with him.\" \"What are you going to do, then?\" \"I am offered work with the circus.\" \"You are!\" exclaimed the country boy, opening wide his eyes in astonishment. \"What are you going to do?\" \"I\u0027m going to be an acrobat.\" \"What\u0027s that?\" Kit explained as well as he could. \"What are they going to pay you?\" \"Ten dollars a week and my expenses,\" answered Kit, proudly. \"Jehu!\" ejaculated the other boy. \"Why, that\u0027s good wages for a man. Do you think they\u0027d hire me, too?\" \"If you think you can do what they require, you can ask them.\" \"Why can\u0027t I do it as well as you?\" \"Because I have been practicing for a long time at a gymnasium. What is your name?\" \"Bill Morris.\" \"Then, Bill, don\u0027t say a word to any one about my plans. Suppose we go to Grafton together?\" \"All right!\" Before the boys parted they made an agreement to meet at five o\u0027clock the next morning, to set out on their walk to Grafton. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3010/83124.html","bookId":281,"book":{"id":281,"title":"The Young Acrobat of the Great North American Circus","description":"简介： There was great excitement in Smyrna, especially among the boys.
