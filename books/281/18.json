{"id":8569,"no":18,"title":"CHAPTER XVIII. MR. BICKFORD\u0027S MORTIFYING DISCOVERY.","content":"Mr. Bickford was in excellent spirits. He had enjoyed the evening, and although he had been compelled to disburse a dollar for two circus tickets, a sum which to him seemed large, he was disposed to acknowledge that he had received his money\u0027s worth. Besides, and this seemed to him the greatest triumph of all, he had recovered his runaway apprentice, or thought he had. He inwardly resolved that Kit should smart for his past insubordination, though he had not yet decided in what way he would get[Pg 90] even with him. The unexpected submissiveness shown by Kit elated him, and confirmed him in the idea he had long entertained that he could manage boys a good deal better than the average of men. \"Talk about hard cases,\" he said one day to his wife. \"I\u0027d like to see the boy that can get the start of Aaron Bickford. He\u0027ll have to get up unusually airly in the mornin\u0027.\" Mr. Bickford felt a little like crowing over his captive, and turned his head partly round to survey the boy on the back seat. Fortunately for William the darkness was so great that there was small chance of his detecting the imposture. \"I reckon you didn\u0027t expect to be ridin\u0027 back to Oakford along of me this evenin\u0027,\" he observed. \"No, sir,\" muttered William in a voice scarcely audible. \"Ho, ho, you feel kind of grouty, eh?\" said the blacksmith. \"Well, I ain\u0027t much surprised. You thought you could have your own way with Aaron Bickford, but you\u0027re beginnin\u0027 to see your mistake, I reckon?\" \"Yes, sir,\" replied the supposed Kit, in a meek voice. \"Ho, ho! That\u0027s the way boys ginerally come out when they try to buck agin\u0027 their elders. Not but you might have succeeded with some men, but you didn\u0027t know the man you had to deal with this time.\" There was a sort of gurgle, for William was trying hard not to laugh, as he was picturing to himself the rage and mortification of Mr. Bickford when he discovered the deceit that had been practiced upon him. But the blacksmith misunderstood the sound, and thought Kit was sobbing.[Pg 91] \"You needn\u0027t take on!\" he said, magnanimously. \"It ain\u0027t so bad as it might be. You\u0027ll be a good deal better off learnin\u0027 a good trade than trampin\u0027 round the country with the circus. I hope this\u0027ll be a lesson to you. You\u0027d better not try to run away ag\u0027in, for it won\u0027t be no use. You won\u0027t always have that long-legged giant to help you. If I\u0027d done right, I should have had him took up for \u0027sault and battery. He needn\u0027t think because he\u0027s eight feet high, more or less, that he can defy the laws of the land. I reckon he got a little skeered of what he done, or he wouldn\u0027t have acted so different this evening.\" William did not reply to this. He was rather in hopes Mr. Bickford would stop addressing him, for he did not like to run the risk of answering, as it might open the eyes of the blacksmith to the fact that he had the wrong boy in the wagon. The distance to Oakford steadily diminished, though Mr. Bickford\u0027s horse was a slow one. At length it had dwindled to half a mile. \"Now I don\u0027t care if he does find out who I am,\" thought William. \"It ain\u0027t but a little way home now, and I shouldn\u0027t mind walking.\" Still his own house was rather beyond Mr. Bickford\u0027s, and it was just as well to ride the whole way, if he could escape detection so long. \"Where did you learn them circus performances, Christopher?\" suddenly asked the blacksmith, turning once more in his seat. By this time they were within a few rods of the blacksmith\u0027s yard, and William became bold, now that he had nothing to lose by it. \"My name isn\u0027t Christopher,\" he answered in his usual tone. \"Your name isn\u0027t Christopher? That\u0027s what your uncle told me.\"[Pg 92] \"I think you are mistaken,\" said William quietly. \"What\u0027s got into the boy? Is he goin\u0027 to deny his own name? What is your name, then?\" \"My name is William Morris,\" was the distinct response. \"What!\" exclaimed the blacksmith in amazement. \"I think you ought to know me, Mr. Bickford. I worked for you some time, you know.\" \"Take off your hat, and let me look at your face!\" said Aaron Bickford, sternly. William laughed as he complied with the request. It was now rather lighter, and the blacksmith, peering into his face, saw that it was indeed true—that the boy on the back seat was not Kit Watson at all, but his ex-apprentice, William Morris. \"It\u0027s Bill Morris, by the living jingo!\" he exclaimed. \"What do you say to that, Sarah?\" \"You\u0027re a master hand at managing boys, Aaron,\" said his wife sarcastically. \"How came you in the wagon, Bill Morris?\" demanded Bickford, not caring to answer his wife. \"The giant put me in,\" answered William. \"Where is that boy, Christopher Watson?\" \"I expect he is travelin\u0027 with the show, Mr. Bickford.\" \"Who put you up to this mean trick?\" demanded the blacksmith, wrathfully. \"Kit Watson.\" \"I\u0027ve got an account to settle with you, William Morris. I s\u0027pose you think you\u0027ve done something pretty smart.\" \"I think he has, Aaron,\" said Mrs. Bickford, who seemed to take a malicious pleasure in opening her husband\u0027s wounds afresh. \"Mrs. Bickford, it isn\u0027t very creditable in you to[Pg 93] triumph over your husband, just after he\u0027s been spendin\u0027 fifty cents for your amusement.\" \"Goodness knows, Mr. Bickford, you don\u0027t often take me to shows. I guess what you spend that way won\u0027t ruin you.\" While the married pair were indulging in their little recriminations, William had managed to slip out of the wagon in the rear, and he was now a rod away. \"Good night, Mr. Bickford!\" he shouted. \"I\u0027m much obliged to you for bringing me home. It\u0027s saved me a long walk.\" The blacksmith\u0027s reply was one that I do not care to record. He was thoroughly angry and disgusted. If it hadn\u0027t been so late he would have got out and tried to inflict punishment on William with his whip, but the boy was too far away by this time to make this possible. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3010/83133.html","bookId":281,"book":{"id":281,"title":"The Young Acrobat of the Great North American Circus","description":"简介： There was great excitement in Smyrna, especially among the boys.
