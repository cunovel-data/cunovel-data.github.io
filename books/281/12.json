{"id":8563,"no":12,"title":"CHAPTER XII. MR. BICKFORD\u0027S DEFEAT.","content":"Aaron Bickford was a strong man. By his work at the forge he had strengthened his muscles till they were like iron. So was Kit a strong boy, but it would be absurd to represent him as a match for the sturdy blacksmith. \"I\u0027ve got ye at last!\" repeated Bickford tightening his grasp of Kit\u0027s coat collar. \"Let go my collar!\" cried Kit, not struggling, for he knew that it would be useless. \"I\u0027ll let go your collar when I\u0027ve got ye in the wagon,\" answered the blacksmith, \"and not till then. You, Bill, bring along his valise. I\u0027ll take ye home in the wagon, though it would be only right if I let ye walk.\" \"Mr. Bickford,\" said Kit, \"you have no right to touch me. You have no authority over me.\" \"I ain\u0027t, hey? Well, we\u0027ll argy that matter when we get home.\" And he commenced dragging Kit in the direction of the wagon. It certainly seemed as if Kit\u0027s plans were destined, if not for defeat, to postponement. Unconditional surrender was his only choice against the superior strength of Aaron Bickford. It was certainly very vexatious.[Pg 61] But help was nearer than he anticipated. They were now within sight of the circus tents, and Kit, to his joy, descried the giant, Achilles Henderson, taking a morning walk, and already within hearing distance. \"Mr. Henderson!\" he called out, eagerly. \"Who is that you\u0027re calling?\" asked the blacksmith sharply. Achilles heard, and instantly recognized the boy who had talked with him at Smyrna. It took but a few strides to bring him to the spot where Kit was held in captivity. \"What does this mean?\" he asked. \"This man is dragging me away without authority,\" answered Kit. \"Who is he?\" asked the giant. \"He is a blacksmith, and claims me as an apprentice, but I never agreed to work for him.\" \"That\u0027s a lie,\" said the blacksmith, \"he\u0027s my runaway apprentice.\" \"I would believe the boy sooner than you,\" said Achilles, not favorably impressed by the blacksmith\u0027s bull dog look. \"It doesn\u0027t make any difference what you believe,\" said Bickford, rudely; and he began to pull Kit in the direction of the wagon. \"Let go that boy\u0027s collar,\" cried Achilles, sternly. \"I won\u0027t!\" retorted the blacksmith. \"I advise you to mind your own business.\" Achilles Henderson, like most big men, was good natured, but he was roused by the other\u0027s insolence. He carried war into the enemy\u0027s camp by seizing the blacksmith and shaking him till he was compelled to release his grasp. \"What do you mean by this outrage?\" demanded Bickford, furiously.[Pg 62] \"It\u0027s only a gentle hint,\" said Achilles, smiling. \"Now, my friend, I\u0027ve got a piece of advice to give you. If that is your wagon back there you\u0027d better get into it as soon as convenient—the sooner the better—and get out of my way or I\u0027ll give you a stronger hint.\" The blacksmith was too indignant to be prudent. What! Confess himself vanquished, and go home without the boy! The idea was intolerable to him. \"I\u0027m goin\u0027 to take the boy,\" he said, angrily, and darting forward he essayed to seize Kit by the collar again. \"Oho! You need a stronger hint,\" said Achilles. With this he grasped the blacksmith about the middle, and tossed him over the fence into the adjoining field as easily as if he were a cat. Aaron Bickford did not know what had happened to him. He lay motionless for a few seconds, and then picked himself up with some difficulty, and confronted the giant with mingled fear and anger. \"I\u0027ll have the law of ye for this,\" he shouted. Achilles laughed. \"It\u0027s as you like,\" he said. \"I\u0027ve got my witnesses here,\" pointing to the two boys. Mr. Bickford got over the fence, and sullenly turned in the direction of his deserted wagon. \"You\u0027ll hear from me again, all of you!\" he shouted, shaking his fist. \"Don\u0027t trouble yourself to write,\" said the giant, jocosely. \"We can worry along without a letter.\" The blacksmith was too full of wrath for utterance. He kept on his way, muttering to himself, and shaking his fist at intervals. \"Now what\u0027s all this about?\" asked Achilles. \"What\u0027s the matter with our amiable friend?\"[Pg 63] Kit explained. \"So you don\u0027t want to be a blacksmith? Where are you going, if I may inquire?\" \"I\u0027m going to join the circus,\" answered Kit. \"In what capacity—as a lion tamer?\" \"No; I shouldn\u0027t fancy that business. I am to be an acrobat.\" \"An acrobat! But are you qualified?\" asked Achilles, somewhat surprised. He had not heard of Kit\u0027s practice with the Vincenti brothers on the day of his first visit to the circus. \"I am pretty well qualified already,\" answered Kit, \"I saw Mr. Barlow yesterday morning, and he promised me an engagement at ten dollars a week.\" \"Good!\" said Achilles, heartily. \"I am pleased to hear it. I took a liking to you the other day, and I\u0027m glad you\u0027re going to join us. But do you think it wise to choose such a life?\" \"You have chosen it,\" said Kit. \"Yes; but what could I do—a man of my size? I must earn more than a common man. My board and clothes both cost more. What do you think I paid for this suit I have on?\" \"I couldn\u0027t tell, sir.\" \"Sixty dollars. The tailor only charges thirty dollars to a man of ordinary size, but I am so absurdly large that I have to pay double price.\" \"Why don\u0027t you buy your suits ready made?\" asked Kit, smiling. Achilles laughed heartily at the idea. \"Show me a place where I can get ready made clothes to fit me,\" he answered, \"and I will gladly accept your suggestion.\" \"That may be a little difficult, I admit.\"[Pg 64] \"Why, you have no idea how inconvenient I find it to be so large. I can\u0027t find a bed to suit me in any hotel. If I go to the theater I can\u0027t crowd myself into an ordinary seat. I have to have all kinds of clothing, inside and outside, made to order. My hats and shoes must also be made expressly for me.\" \"I suppose you get very well paid,\" suggested Kit. \"Seventy-five dollars a week sounds pretty large, and would be if my expenses were not so great. You wouldn\u0027t be a giant for that money, would you?\" \"I am not so ambitious,\" replied Kit, smiling. \"But there was a moment when I wished myself of your size.\" \"When was that?\" \"When the blacksmith grasped me by the collar.\" \"You don\u0027t have to work very hard,\" said William Morris. \"My boy, it is pretty hard work to be stared at by a crowd of people. I get tired of it often, but I see no other way of making a living.\" \"You would make a pretty good blacksmith.\" \"I couldn\u0027t earn more than a man of average strength, and that wouldn\u0027t be enough, as I have explained.\" \"Were your parents very tall?\" asked Kit. \"My father was six feet in height, but my mother was a small woman. I don\u0027t know what put it into me to grow so big. But here we are at the lot. Will you come in?\" \"When can I see Mr. Barlow?\" asked Kit, anxiously. \"He is at the hotel. He won\u0027t be round till half-past nine. Have you two boys had breakfast?\" \"No,\" answered Kit; \"I\u0027m nearly famished.\" \"Come round to the circus tent. You are to be[Pg 65] one of us, and will board there. I guess we can provide for your friend, too.\" Never was invitation more gladly accepted. Both Kit and William felt as if they had not broken their fast for a week. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3010/83127.html","bookId":281,"book":{"id":281,"title":"The Young Acrobat of the Great North American Circus","description":"简介： There was great excitement in Smyrna, especially among the boys.
