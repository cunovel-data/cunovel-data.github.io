{"id":8562,"no":11,"title":"CHAPTER XI. KIT FALLS INTO THE HANDS OF THE ENEMY.","content":"If Aaron Bickford expected to frighten Kit by his threat, he was destined to find himself badly mistaken. Kit was startled at first, not having anticipated that the blacksmith would get upon his track so soon. But he was a boy of spirit, and had no thought of surrender. Mr. Bickford halted his horse, and Kit faced him. \"Didn\u0027t you find my note?\" he asked. \"Yes, I did.\" \"Then you know that I don\u0027t care to work for you.\"[Pg 56] \"What\u0027s that got to do with it? Your uncle and me have settled that you shall.\" \"Then you\u0027ll have to unsettle it. I have a right to choose my own occupation, and I don\u0027t intend to become a blacksmith. Even if I did, I should choose some one else as my teacher.\" \"None of your impudence, young man! You\u0027ll have a long account to settle with me, I warn you of that.\" \"I had but one account to settle—for my board and lodging—and I\u0027ve attended to that. Good morning, Mr. Bickford.\" Kit turned and began to continue his journey. \"Hallo! Stop, I tell you!\" shouted the blacksmith. \"Have you got any more to say? If so, I\u0027ll listen.\" \"What more I have to say, I shall say with a horsewhip!\" retorted Bickford, grimly, preparing to descend from his wagon. \"Come, William, we must run for it,\" said Kit. \"Are you good at running?\" \"Try me!\" was the laconic reply. By the time Aaron Bickford was out of his wagon, the boys had increased the distance between them by several rods. \"Oho, so that\u0027s your game, is it?\" said the blacksmith. \"If I don\u0027t overhaul them, my name isn\u0027t Aaron Bickford.\" Kit was a good runner—quite as good as his pursuer—but he had one serious disadvantage. His valise was heavy, and materially affected his speed. He had carried it several miles, and though he had shifted it from one hand to the other, both arms were now tired.[Pg 57] \"Let me take it, Kit,\" said his companion, who was now on intimate terms with him. \"It\u0027ll be just as heavy for you as for me.\" \"Never mind! He isn\u0027t after me.\" \"Well, if you don\u0027t mind carrying it a little while.\" The advantage of the change was soon apparent. Kit increased his speed, and William, whose arms were not tired, was not materially retarded by his burden. \"If I had no valise I would climb a tree,\" said Kit, while running. \"I don\u0027t believe Mr. Bickford is good at climbing.\" \"We haven\u0027t got far to go to reach the circus tents,\" returned William. But though the boys held out well, Aaron Bickford gradually gained upon them. Many years at the anvil had given him plenty of wind and endurance. Besides, he was entirely fresh, not having taken a long walk already, as the boys had done. \"You\u0027d better give up!\" he cried out, in the tone of one who was sure of victory. \"It takes more than a boy like you to get the best of Aaron Bickford.\" It did indeed seem as if the boys must surrender. Within a few rods Bickford would be even with them. Kit came to a sudden determination. \"Jump over the fence!\" he cried. There was a rail fence skirting one side of the road. No sooner said than done. Both boys clambered over the fence, and with that barrier between them faced the angry blacksmith. \"Well, I\u0027ve got you!\" he cried, panting. \"Have you? I don\u0027t see it,\" answered Kit. \"You might as well give up fust as last.\" \"Suppose we discuss matters a little, Mr. Bick[Pg 58]ford,\" said Kit, calmly. \"What right have you to pursue me?\" \"What right? Your uncle\u0027s given me the charge of you.\" \"That is something he had no right to do.\" \"Why not? Ain\u0027t he your guardian?\" \"No.\" \"Who is, then?\" \"I have no guardian but myself.\" \"That\u0027s a likely story. I can\u0027t listen to no such foolish talk.\" Aaron Bickford felt that it was time to move upon the enemy\u0027s entrenchments, and, putting one leg on the lower rail, he proceeded to climb over the fence. But the boys had anticipated this move, and were prepared for it. By the time the blacksmith was inside the field, the boys, who were considerably lighter and more active, had crossed to the reverse side. \"Here we are again, Mr. Bickford,\" said William Morris. The blacksmith frowned. \"Don\u0027t you be impudent, Bill Morris,\" he said. \"I haven\u0027t anything to do with you, but I sha\u0027n\u0027t let you sass me.\" \"What have I said that\u0027s out of the way?\" asked William. \"Oh, you\u0027re mighty innocent, you are! You\u0027re aidin\u0027 and abettin\u0027 Kit Watson to escape from me, his lawful master.\" \"I have no master, Mr. Bickford,\" said Kit, proudly. \"Well, that\u0027s what they used to call \u0027em when I was a boy. Boys weren\u0027t so pert and impudent in them days.\" Meanwhile the blacksmith was recrossing the fence.[Pg 59] Kit and William took the opportunity to run, and by the time Mr. Bickford was again on the roadside they were several rods away. This naturally exasperated the blacksmith, who felt mortified at his failure to overtake the youngsters. A new idea occurred to him. \"You, Bill, do you want to earn a dime?\" he asked. \"How?\" inquired William. \"Just help me catch that boy Kit, and I\u0027ll give you ten cents.\" \"I don\u0027t care to earn money that way, Mr. Bickford,\" responded William, scornfully. \"Good for you, William!\" exclaimed Kit. \"You won\u0027t earn ten cents any easier,\" persisted Bickford. \"I wouldn\u0027t do such a mean thing for a dollar, nor five dollars,\" replied William. \"Kit\u0027s a friend of mine, and I\u0027m going to stand by him.\" The blacksmith was made angry by this persistent refusal. Then again he was faint and uncomfortable from having missed his breakfast, which seemed likely to be indefinitely postponed. \"I\u0027ll lick you, Bill Morris, as well as Kit, when I catch you,\" he said. \"Probably you will—when you catch me!\" retorted William, in an aggravating tone. \"Run faster, Kit.\" The boys ran, but again they were impeded by the heavy valise, and slowly but surely the blacksmith was gaining upon them. Kit, who was again carrying the burden, began to show signs of distress, and dropped behind his companion. \"I can\u0027t hold out much longer, Bill,\" he said, puffing laboriously.[Pg 60] Aaron Bickford heard these words, and they impelled him to extra exertion. At last he caught up and grasped Kit by the collar. \"I\u0027ve got ye at last!\" he cried, triumphantly. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3010/83126.html","bookId":281,"book":{"id":281,"title":"The Young Acrobat of the Great North American Circus","description":"简介： There was great excitement in Smyrna, especially among the boys.
