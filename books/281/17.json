{"id":8568,"no":17,"title":"CHAPTER XVII. KIT\u0027S STRATAGEM.","content":"Kit, when dressed, sought the part of the house where he knew that William Morris was seated. \"How did I do, Will?\" he asked. \"Splendidly!\" answered the boy enthusiastically. \"I felt proud of you.\" \"I think I have a right to be satisfied myself. I have had my pay raised.\" \"You don\u0027t mean to say you are to get more than ten dollars?\" said his friend, opening his eyes in amazement. \"I am raised to twenty-five.\" \"You don\u0027t mean to say you are to get twenty-five dollars a week, Kit?\" \"Yes, I do.\" \"And your board?\" \"And my board and traveling expenses,\" added Kit, with a smile. \"I wish I were in your shoes, Kit,\" said William. \"Think of me with only one dollar a week.\" \"Would you be willing to go through my acts for the money I am going to receive?\" William shook his head. \"I couldn\u0027t do it, Kit,\" he replied. \"It always makes me dizzy when I have my head down. I don\u0027t believe I could ever do anything in a circus.\"[Pg 85] \"Well, William, I won\u0027t forget you. If I save money, as I am sure to do, I\u0027ll see if I can\u0027t do something for you by and by. By the way, did you see Mr. and Mrs. Bickford?\" \"No, you don\u0027t mean to say they are here?\" \"Look over there!\" William followed the direction of Kit\u0027s finger, and he easily discovered the blacksmith and his wife. \"By gracious! You\u0027re right!\" he said. \"It\u0027s the first money I\u0027ve known old Bickford to pay for any amusement for years.\" \"They came after me, William.\" \"You won\u0027t go back with them?\" \"Not much. I don\u0027t care to give up twenty-five dollars a week for the privilege of learning the trade of a blacksmith.\" \"Suppose they try to carry you off?\" \"That gives me an idea. With your help I\u0027ll try to play a trick on them. It\u0027ll be capital fun.\" \"Go ahead and tell me what it is, Kit. I\u0027m with you!\" \"My plan is that you should ride home with Mr. Bickford,\" said Kit. \"I don\u0027t understand,\" said William, looking puzzled. \"I\u0027ll tell you my idea. Bickford has come here with the intention of taking me back with him to Oakford.\" \"But you don\u0027t mean to go?\" \"Of course not, but when the show is over I shall put myself in his way, and after a little objection agree to go. I will ask for five minutes to get ready. In that time I will change hats with you, and as it is dark you can easily pass yourself off for me.\"[Pg 86] \"Capital!\" exclaimed William, laughing. \"Won\u0027t the old man look foolish when he finds out who is with him?\" \"Don\u0027t let him know till you arrive, or he would force you to leave the carriage, and walk home alone, and a six mile walk is no joke.\" \"All right Kit! I understand, and I think I can carry out your idea. I haven\u0027t much love for the old man or his wife either, and I am glad of a chance to get even with them.\" The performance continued till ten o\u0027clock. The blacksmith and his wife enjoyed it beyond their anticipations. Amusements of any kind were new to them, and their pleasure was like that of children. \"I begin to think, Sarah, we shall get our money\u0027s worth,\" said Aaron cautiously, as the entertainment neared its end; \"this is a great show.\" \"So it is, Aaron. I don\u0027t begrudge the money myself, though fifty cents is a pretty high price to pay. Then, besides, you\u0027ll have a chance to carry the boy home.\" \"That\u0027s so, Sarah. Just as soon as the show is over, foller me, and we\u0027ll try to find him.\" At length the last act was ended, and the crowd of spectators began pouring from the tent. Mr. Bickford hurriedly emerged from the audience, and began to look around for Kit. He had but little trouble in finding him, for the boy purposely put himself in his way. Aaron Bickford strode up to him. \"Well, I\u0027ve caught you at last!\" he said, putting his hand on the boy\u0027s shoulder. \"What do you want of me, Mr. Bickford?\" said Kit. \"What do I want of you? Well, I want you to go home with me, of course.\"[Pg 87] \"Won\u0027t you let me stay with the circus a week?\" asked Kit, in a subdued tone. \"No, I won\u0027t. I\u0027ve got the wagon here, and I\u0027m goin\u0027 to take you back with me to-night.\" \"If you really think my uncle wishes it, perhaps I had better go,\" said Kit, in what appeared to be a wavering tone. Mr. Bickford was quite elated. He feared he should have trouble in persuading Kit to accompany him. He would not have been surprised if the boy had disappeared, and given him trouble to find him, and his unexpected submissiveness was an agreeable surprise. \"Well, boy, it\u0027s time to be goin\u0027. Oakford\u0027s six miles off, and we won\u0027t get home before midnight unless we start right off.\" \"I\u0027ll go and get my things, Mr. Bickford. Where is your horse and wagon?\" \"Out by the entrance. It\u0027s hitched to a tree.\" \"All right! You go and unhitch the horse, and I\u0027ll be right along.\" \"But suppose you give me the slip? You\u0027d better go along now.\" \"I\u0027ll bring him with me, Mr. Bickford,\" said the giant. \"I\u0027m sorry he isn\u0027t going to stay with us, and I\u0027ll see him off.\" Achilles Henderson spoke in so straightforward a manner that Mr. Bickford was deceived. \"Very well,\" he said. \"I\u0027ll go along with Mrs. Bickford. Don\u0027t keep me waitin\u0027, for it\u0027s gettin\u0027 late.\" The blacksmith and his wife took up their march to the place where their team had been hitched. They found it safe, and untied the horse. \"We\u0027re goin\u0027 to have a dark ride home, mother,\" he said.[Pg 88] \"Yes, Aaron, but you\u0027ve done a good evening\u0027s work.\" \"That\u0027s so, Sarah. I expected I\u0027d have more trouble with the boy.\" \"There\u0027s nothing like being firm, Aaron. When he saw you were in earnest, he gave up.\" \"I mean to keep a tight rein on him, Sarah. He\u0027s a boy that likes to have his own way, if I ain\u0027t greatly mistaken. We must break his will.\" The horse was unhitched, and still Kit had not arrived. Mr. Bickford began to fear that he had been tricked after all, when two figures, contrasting strongly with each other, appeared. One was the giant, in his ample height, and the other was a boy. \"There they are, Aaron!\" said Mrs. Bickford, who was the first to descry the oddly assorted pair. \"Where is the boy to sit?\" asked Achilles. \"In the back seat. Mother and I will sit in front.\" \"All right! There you are!\" said Mr. Henderson, lifting the boy in his arms, as easily as if he were a kitten, and putting him on the rear seat. \"Good-by, Kit!\" he said. \"I\u0027m sorry you\u0027re going to leave us. Perhaps Mr. Bickford will let you off if we show anywhere near here.\" \"The boy will be at work, and can\u0027t be let off,\" said the blacksmith, stiffly. \"But it is time we were off.\" \"Good-by, then, Kit!\" \"Good-by!\" said the supposed Kit, in a low tone, for he feared that the difference in his voice would be recognized. But Mr. Bickford had no suspicions. He was anxious to get started, for he and his wife were always in bed by this time ordinarily. So the team started, and Achilles Henderson, sup[Pg 89]pressing a laugh, strode away to the circus cars, which were already being prepared for a midnight journey to the next place. It may be explained here that the circus of to-day generally owns its own cars, which are used for the conveyance of all connected with it, their luggage, the tents, the animals, and all the paraphernalia of the show. As soon as the show is ended, the canvas men set to work to take down and fold up the tents. All the freight is conveyed to the cars, and the razorbacks, already referred to, set about loading them. The performers, ticketmen, and candy butchers seek their berths in the sleeping cars and are often in the land of dreams before the train starts. While Mr. Bickford was driving in the darkness to Oakford with the supposed Kit on the back seat, the real Kit was in his berth in the circus cars, preparing for a refreshing night\u0027s rest. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3010/83132.html","bookId":281,"book":{"id":281,"title":"The Young Acrobat of the Great North American Circus","description":"简介： There was great excitement in Smyrna, especially among the boys.
