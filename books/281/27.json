{"id":8578,"no":27,"title":"CHAPTER XXVII. A MINER\u0027S CABIN.","content":"Kit\u0027s principal captor was known as Dick Hayden. He was an Englishman, and a leader in every kind of mischief. If there was any disturbance between the miners and their employers, he was generally found to be at the bottom of it. A naturally quarrelsome disposition was intensified by intemperance. In the attack upon the circus tents he found himself in his element. His ignominious defeat made him ugly and revengeful. His wife was dead, but he had one child, Janet, a girl of thirteen, who cooked for him and took care of his cabin. The poor girl had a hard time of it, but she endeavored so far as possible to avoid trouble with her brutal parent. It was near ten o\u0027clock when Hayden came home after locking Kit in the deserted cabin. He had gone away without supper, but late as it was, Janet had something hot ready for him on the stove.[Pg 134] \"Well, Janet, child, have you my supper ready?\" he said, not unpleasantly, for his victory over Kit and the meditated revenge of the next day had put him in good humor. \"Yes, father; it\u0027s on the stove and ready to dish up.\" \"Lay the table, then, for I\u0027m main tired and hungry.\" The little girl quickly spread the cloth, and Dick Hayden ate like a voracious animal. When supper was over he sat back in his chair and lit a pipe. A comfortable supper made him loquacious. \"Well, Janet, you don\u0027t ask where I\u0027ve been.\" \"Was it to the circus, father?\" \"Yes.\" \"How did you like the show?\" \"I didn\u0027t see it,\" he growled, a frown gathering upon his brow. \"And why not, father?\" \"Because we had a fight to get in free, and got the worst of it.\" \"They must be main strong, then, those circus men.\" \"Strong!\" repeated Hayden, scornfully. \"Well, mayhap they are, but we\u0027d have bested them but for the giant.\" \"The giant! Is it the big man I saw in the parade?\" \"Yes; he\u0027s as strong as three men. He flung me down as easily as I\u0027d throw a boy.\" \"Then he must have been strong, for you\u0027re a powerful man, father.\" \"There isn\u0027t a man as works in the mine\u0027ll compare with me, lass,\" said Hayden, proudly; \"but all the same I\u0027m no match for a monster.\"[Pg 135] \"Tell me about it, father,\" said Janet, with natural curiosity. Dick Hayden went on to describe the fight around the ticket stand, and how he had slipped away, intending to cut the ropes of the tent and let it down on the heads of the spectators gathered inside. \"I\u0027d have done it, too,\" he added, \"but for a kid.\" \"I thought just now you said it was the giant.\" \"And I stick to it, lass; but this boy saw what I was doing, and brought the giant to the spot. I could do nothing after that. He threw me down, so that for a few minutes I was stunned.\" \"And how did the fight come out at the ticket stand, father?\" \"Our men had almost overpowered the circus men, when the giant rushed into the midst, and, seizing a club from Bob Stubbs, laid about him, till half a dozen of our strongest men lay on the ground with broken heads.\" What puzzled Janet was, that her father should have come home in such good humor after so disastrous a defeat. It was contrary to her experience of him. She would naturally have expected that he would be surly and quarrelsome. The mystery was soon made clear. \"But we\u0027ve got even with them!\" chuckled Hayden directly after. \"How is that, father?\" \"We caught the kid.\" \"You have?\" \"Yes; he was goin\u0027 to the circus cars to turn in when Stubbs and I caught him.\" \"You—you didn\u0027t kill him, father?\" asked Janet in alarm. \"No, not yet.\"[Pg 136] \"Where is he?\" \"Do you mind the deserted cabin on Knob Hill?\" \"Yes, father.\" \"He\u0027s locked up in that, tied hand and foot.\" \"How long do you mean to keep him there?\" asked Janet, anxiously. \"Till to-morrow, and then——\" Dick paused ominously. \"Well, and then?\" \"He\u0027ll be lucky if he gets off with a whole skin,\" growled her father. \"But for him I\u0027d have brought down the tent about the ears of the people that sat inside, and we\u0027d have had a fine revenge on the showmen.\" \"You don\u0027t mean to kill the boy, do you, father?\" \"What is it to you, lass? You\u0027d best mind your own business. You\u0027ve got nothing to do with it.\" \"How does the boy look? Was it the one that drove the first chariot, father?\" \"Like enough, lass! Did you see him?\" \"Yes; I saw the parade. Everybody was out in the streets then.\" \"And you took partic\u0027lar notice of the boy? That\u0027s like a lass,\" chuckled Hayden. \"But it was his duty, father, to stand by the show, seein\u0027 he belongs to it.\" \"I don\u0027t trouble myself about that. He brought that monster on me, and I\u0027m sore yet with the fall he gave me. I\u0027ll take it out of the kid.\" \"But it seems to me, father, it would be better to lay for the giant.\" \"What folly is that, lass? I\u0027d be main glad to give the giant a dose of what he gave me, but he\u0027ll leave town to-night, and I ain\u0027t big enough to tackle him, even if I had the chance. So I\u0027ll revenge my[Pg 137]self on his friend, the boy. The kid may be his son, for aught I know.\" \"And what will you do for him, father?\" asked Janet, pertinaciously. \"You won\u0027t kill him?\" \"Well, I won\u0027t go so far as that, for I\u0027ve no mind to put my neck in a noose, but I\u0027ll flog him within an inch of his life. I\u0027ll teach him to mind his own business for the future.\" Janet knew her father\u0027s strength and brutality, and she shuddered at the idea of the boy being exposed to it. She knew very well it would be of no use to make a protest. She would only get herself into trouble. Yet she couldn\u0027t reconcile herself to the thought of poor Kit being cruelly punished. She asked herself what she could do to prevent it. There was one thing in favor of a rescue. She knew where Kit was confined. If it were not so late she would steal out, and going to the cabin relieve him from captivity. But it was too late, and too dark for that. Besides, she could not leave her father\u0027s cabin without observation. \"I will wait till to-morrow morning,\" she said to herself. It so chanced that on account of some slight repairs the mine in which her father was employed was shut down for a few days. This was favorable, for he would lie in bed till eight o\u0027clock at least, and there would be a chance to get out without observation. The next morning, about five o\u0027clock, Janet rose from her bed, hastily dressed herself, and crept to the door of her father\u0027s chamber. He was sound asleep, and breathing heavily. There was small chance of his awakening before seven o\u0027clock. Janet took a little meat and bread in a tin pail, for[Pg 138] she thought the captive might be in need of breakfast, and then, putting a sharp knife in her pocket to cut the ropes that bound him, she left the house and took her way over the hill to the deserted cabin which served as Kit\u0027s prison. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3010/83142.html","bookId":281,"book":{"id":281,"title":"The Young Acrobat of the Great North American Circus","description":"简介： There was great excitement in Smyrna, especially among the boys.
