{"id":8581,"no":30,"title":"CHAPTER XXX. DICK HAYDEN FINDS THE BIRD FLOWN.","content":"Half an hour previously Dick Hayden and his congenial friend, Bob Stubbs, reached the cabin. They had much pleasant and jocose conversation on the way touching their young captive, and how he had probably passed the night. They had personal injuries to avenge, and though Achilles was responsible for them, they proposed to wreak vengeance on the boy whom a luckless fate had thrown into their hands. \"My shoulders are sore yet,\" said Hayden, \"over the fall that big brute gave me.\" \"And my head hasn\u0027t got over the crack I got when he laid me flat with his club,\" responded Stubbs. \"Well, we\u0027ve got a friend of his, that\u0027s one comfort. I\u0027m going to take it out of the kid\u0027s hide.\" \"You don\u0027t mean to—do for him?\" said Stubbs, cautiously. \"I don\u0027t mean to kill him, if that\u0027s what you mean, Stubbs. I have too much regard for my neck, but I mean to give him a sound flogging. You ain\u0027t afraid, be you?\"[Pg 149] \"Catch Bob Stubbs afraid of anything, except the hangman\u0027s rope! I don\u0027t mind telling you that I have reasons to be afraid of that.\" \"Why? You\u0027ve never been hung, have you?\" \"No; but an uncle of mine was strung up in England.\" \"What for?\" \"He got into trouble with a fellow workman and stabbed him.\" \"He was in bad luck. Why didn\u0027t he cut it, and come to America?\" \"He tried it, but the bobbies caught him in the steerage of an ocean steamer, and then it was all up with him.\" \"Well, I hope his nephew will come to a better end. But here we are at the cabin.\" There was nothing in the outward appearance of the hut to indicate that the bird was flown. Janet bolted the door after releasing the prisoner, and no one could judge that it had been opened. \"All is safe,\" said Bob Stubbs. \"Of course it is! Why shouldn\u0027t it be?\" \"No reason; but some of his friends might have found him.\" \"All his friends are at Groveton. Then they had no idea what we did with him.\" \"They must have found out that he was gone.\" \"They couldn\u0027t find him, so that would do him no good.\" Stubbs was about to draw the bolt, but Hayden stayed his hand. \"Wait a minute, Bob,\" he said; \"I\u0027ll look in at the window, and see what he is doing.\" Dick Hayden went around to the rear of the building, and flattened his face against the pane in the[Pg 150] effort to see the corner where the captive had been tied. He could not see very distinctly, but what he did see startled him. He could perceive no one. \"Could the boy have loosened the rope?\" he asked himself hurriedly. Even in that case, as the window was nailed so that it could not be opened, and the door was bolted, there seemed no way of escape. His eyes eagerly explored other portions of the cabin, but he could not catch a glimpse of Kit. He rushed round to the front, and in an excitement which Stubbs could not understand, pulled the bolt back with a jerk. \"What\u0027s the matter, Dick?\" asked Stubbs, staring. Dick Hayden did not answer, but threw open the door. He strode in, and peeped here and there. \"The boy\u0027s gone!\" he said hoarsely, to Stubbs, who followed close behind. \"Gone!\" echoed Stubbs, in blank amazement. \"How did he get away?\" \"That\u0027s the question,\" responded Dick, growling. \"Well, I\u0027m—flabbergasted! There\u0027s witchery here!\" Dick Hayden bent over and picked up the pieces of rope which lay in the corner where the prisoner had been placed. He examined the ends, and said briefly, turning to Stubbs: \"They\u0027ve been cut!\" \"So they have, Dick. Who in natur\u0027 could have done it? Perhaps the kid did it himself. Might have had a knife in his pocket.\" \"Don\u0027t be a fool, Stubbs! Supposin\u0027 he\u0027d done it, how was he goin\u0027 to get out?\"[Pg 151] \"That\u0027s what beats me!\" \"Somebody must have let him out.\" \"Do you think it\u0027s his circus friends?\" \"No; they\u0027re all in Groveton. Somebody must have been passin\u0027 and heard the boy holler, and let him out.\" \"What are you goin\u0027 to do about it, Dick?\" \"Goin\u0027 to sit down and take a smoke. It may give me an idea.\" It will be noticed that of these two, Dick Hayden, as the bolder and stronger spirit, was the leader, and Bob Stubbs the subservient follower. Stubbs was no less brutal, when occasion served, but he was not self reliant. He wanted some one to lead the way, and he was willing to follow. The two men sat down beside the cabin, and lit their pipes. Nothing was said for a time. Dick seemed disinclined to conversation, and Stubbs was always disposed to be silent when enjoying a smoke. The smoke continued for twenty minutes or more. Finally Dick withdrew the pipe from his mouth. \"Well, Dick, what do you think about it? What shall we do?\" inquired his friend. \"I am going to foller the kid.\" \"But you don\u0027t know where he\u0027s gone,\" replied Stubbs. \"No; but I may strike his track. Are you with me?\" \"Of course I am.\" \"Then listen to me. The one that let the boy out knows the neighborhood. The boy would naturally want to go to Groveton, and likely he would be directed to Stover. If the kid had any money, he would ask Stover to drive him over, or else he would foot it.\"[Pg 152] \"You\u0027re right, Dick. That\u0027s what he\u0027d do,\" said Stubbs, admiring his companion\u0027s penetration. \"Then we must go over to Stover\u0027s.\" \"All right! I\u0027m with you.\" \"I\u0027m a poor man, Bob, but I\u0027d give a ten dollar bill to have that kid in my power once more.\" \"I don\u0027t doubt it, Dick.\" \"I hate to have it said that a kid like that got the advantage of Dick Hayden.\" \"So would I, Bob.\" \"If I get hold of him I\u0027ll give him a lesson that he won\u0027t soon forget.\" \"And serve him right too.\" The two men rose, and took their way across the fields, following exactly the same path which our hero had traveled earlier in the morning. They walked with brisk steps, having a definite purpose in view. Dick Hayden was intensely anxious to recapture Kit, whose escape had balked him of his vengeance, and mortified him exceedingly. As he expressed it, he could not bear to think that a boy of sixteen had got the advantage of him. At length they reached the red house already referred to, and saw Ham Stover, the owner, in the yard. \"You are up betimes, Dick,\" said Stover. \"What\u0027s in the wind?\" \"Have you seen aught of a boy of sixteen passin\u0027 this way?\" asked Dick, anxiously. \"A likely lookin\u0027 lad, well dressed?\" \"Yes.\" \"He was round here an hour ago, and took breakfast in the house.\" This was true; the slight refreshment Janet had brought him having proved insufficient to completely[Pg 153] stay the cravings of Kit\u0027s appetite after his night in the cabin. \"Where is he now?\" \"What do you want of him?\" \"Never you mind—I\u0027ll tell you bimeby. Where is he?\" \"He wanted me to harness up and take him to Groveton.\" Dick Hayden and Stubbs exchanged glances. It was evident that they had struck Kit\u0027s trail. \"Well, did you do it?\" \"No; I couldn\u0027t spare the time. Besides I wanted the horse to go to the village. I\u0027m going to harness up now.\" \"What did the boy do?\" \"He walked.\" \"How long since did he start?\" \"About half an hour or thereabouts.\" Dick Hayden made a rapid calculation. \"We may overtake him if we walk fast,\" he said. Without stopping to enlighten the curiosity of Mr. Stover the two men set out rapidly on the Groveton road. \n \n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3010/83145.html","bookId":281,"book":{"id":281,"title":"The Young Acrobat of the Great North American Circus","description":"简介： There was great excitement in Smyrna, especially among the boys.
