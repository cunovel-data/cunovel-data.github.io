{"id":8561,"no":10,"title":"CHAPTER X. KIT\u0027S FIRST NIGHT AT THE BLACKSMITH\u0027S.","content":"At nine o\u0027clock the blacksmith, giving a deep yawn, said: \"You\u0027d better be getting to bed, young feller. You\u0027ll have to be up bright and airly in the morning.\" Kit was already feeling sleepy, and made no objection. Though it was yet early, he had found it hard work to get through the evening, as he could find nothing to read except a weekly paper, three months old, and a copy of \"Pilgrim\u0027s Progress.\" In truth, neither Mr. Bickford nor his wife were of a literary turn, and did not even manage to keep up with the news of the day. \"I am ready,\" said Kit. \"Mother, show him to his room,\" added the blacksmith. \"To-morrow I\u0027ll give him a lesson at the forge.\" \"Perhaps you will,\" said Kit to himself, \"but I think it doubtful.\" Kit\u0027s room was a small back one on the second floor. The front apartment was occupied by Mr. and Mrs. Bickford, and there was one of the same size which was used as a spare chamber. Kit\u0027s room was supplied with a cot bed, and was furnished in the plainest manner. One thing he missed. He saw no washstand. \"Where am I to wash in the morning?\" he asked. \"You can wash in the tin basin in the kitchen,\"[Pg 51] answered Mrs. Bickford. \"There\u0027s a bar of soap down there and a roller towel, so I guess you won\u0027t have to go dirty.\" Kit shuddered at the suggestion. He had seen bars of yellow soap in the grocery at home, and didn\u0027t think he should enjoy its use. Nor did he fancy using the same towel with the blacksmith and his wife. He had seen the roller towel hanging beside the sink, and judged from its appearance that it had already been used nearly a week. \"I have been accustomed to wash in my own room,\" he ventured to say. \"You\u0027ve been used to a great many things that you won\u0027t find here,\" replied Mrs. Bickford, grimly. Kit thought it extremely likely. \"If you can\u0027t do as the rest of us do, you can get along without washing,\" continued the lady. \"I will try and manage,\" answered Kit, bearing in mind that he expected to leave the Bickford mansion forever the next morning. \"That new boy of yours is kind of uppish,\" remarked Mrs. Bickford, when she returned to the sitting room. \"What\u0027s the matter now?\" \"He wants to wash in his own room. He\u0027s too fine a gentleman to wash in the kitchen.\" \"What did you tell him?\" Mrs. Bickford repeated her remark. \"Good for you, mother! We\u0027ll take down his pride a little.\" \"Is he goin\u0027 to work in them fine clo\u0027es he brought with him?\" \"He didn\u0027t bring any others.\" \"He\u0027ll spile \u0027em, and not have anything to wear to meetin\u0027.\"[Pg 52] \"Haven\u0027t we got a pair of overalls in the house—one that the last boy used?\" \"Yes; I\u0027ll get \u0027em right away.\" \"They\u0027ll be good for him to wear.\" Before Kit got into bed, the door of his chamber was unceremoniously opened, and Mrs. Bickford walked in, carrying a faded pair of overalls. \"You can put these on in the mornin\u0027,\" she said. \"They\u0027ll keep your clo\u0027es clean. They may be a mite long for you, but you can turn up the legs at the bottom.\" She left the room without waiting for an answer. Kit surveyed the overalls with amusement. \"I wonder how I should look in them,\" he said to himself. He drew them over his trousers, and regarded his figure as well as he could in the little seven by nine glass that hung on the wall. \"There is Kit, the young blacksmith!\" he said with a smile. \"On the whole, I don\u0027t think it improves my appearance. I\u0027ll take them off, and leave them for the next boy.\" \"What did the boy say, mother?\" asked Mr. Bickford, upon his wife\u0027s return. \"He just took \u0027em; he didn\u0027t say anything.\" \"I s\u0027pose he\u0027s never worn overalls before,\" said the blacksmith. \"What do you think he told me on the way over?\" \"I don\u0027t know.\" \"He said he wasn\u0027t goin\u0027 to work for me at all. He didn\u0027t like the blacksmith\u0027s trade.\" \"Well, of all things!\" \"I just told him he hadn\u0027t no choice in the matter, that me and his uncle had arranged matters, and that I should hold him to the contract.\"[Pg 53] \"I\u0027m afraid he\u0027ll be dainty about his vittles. He didn\u0027t eat much dinner.\" \"Wait till he gets to work, mother. I guess he\u0027ll have appetite enough. I mean he shall earn his board, at any rate.\" \"I hope we won\u0027t have no trouble with him, Aaron.\" \"You needn\u0027t be afraid, mother.\" \"Somehow, Aaron, you never did manage to keep boys very long,\" said Mrs. Bickford, dubiously. \"Because their folks were weak, and allowed \u0027em to have their own way. It\u0027ll be different with this boy.\" \"What makes you think so?\" \"Because his uncle is anxious to get rid of him. He told me the boy, till lately, had imagined he was goin\u0027 to have property. He\u0027s supported him out of charity, dressin\u0027 him like a gentleman, sendin\u0027 him to school, and spendin\u0027 a pile of money on him. Now he thinks it about time to quit, and have the boy learn a trade. Of course the boy\u0027ll complain, and try to beg off, but it won\u0027t be no use. Stephen Watson won\u0027t make no account of what he says. He keeps a horse himself, and has promised to have him shod at my shop.\" \"Well, it may be for the best; I hope so.\" Aaron Bickford felt a good deal of confidence in himself. He understood very well that Kit was averse to working in his shop, but he meant to make him do it. \"I\u0027d like to see the boy I can\u0027t master,\" he said to himself, complacently. \"Years hence, when the boy has a forge of his own, he\u0027ll thank me for perseverin\u0027 with him. There\u0027s money to be made in the business. Why, when I began I wasn\u0027t worth a hundred[Pg 54] dollars, and I owed for my anvil. Now I own this house and shop, and I\u0027ve got a tidy sum in the bank.\" This was true. But it must be added that the result was largely due to the pinching economy which both he and his wife had practiced. When Mr. Bickford woke up the next morning it was half-past five o\u0027clock. \"Strange how I came to oversleep,\" he said. \"I guess I must have been more tuckered out than I supposed. Well, the boy\u0027s had a longer nap than I meant he should. However, it\u0027s only for one mornin\u0027.\" Mr. Bickford did not linger over his toilet. Five minutes was rather an overstatement of the time. He went to Kit\u0027s chamber, and, opening the door, went in as unceremoniously as his wife had done the night before. A surprise awaited him. There was no one in the bed. \"What! has the boy got up a\u0027ready?\" he asked himself, in a bewildered way. \"He\u0027s better at gettin\u0027 up than I expected.\" Looking about him, he discovered on a chair by the bedside the overalls, and upon them a note and a silver dollar. \"What\u0027s all that mean?\" he asked himself. Looking closer he saw that the note was directed to him. Beginning to suspect that something was wrong, he opened it. This was what the note contained: Mr. Bickford—I leave you a dollar to pay for my food and lodging. I do not care to become a blacksmith. Good by. Kit Watson. \"I\u0027ll have him back!\" exclaimed Aaron Bickford, an angry look appearing on his face. \"He ain\u0027t goin\u0027 to get the best of me.\"[Pg 55] Mr. Bickford harnessed up his horse, and started after the fugitive. But in what direction should he drive? He was not long at fault. He met a milkman who had seen two boys starting out on the Grafton road, and so informed him. \"I guess they\u0027re bound for the circus,\" he said. \"Like as not,\" returned the blacksmith. But he had a long chase of it. It was not until he was within half a mile of the circus tents that he descried the two boys, trudging along, Kit with his valise in his hand. Hearing the sound of wheels, the boys looked back, and in some dismay recognized their pursuer. The blacksmith stood up in his wagon, and pointing his long whip at Kit, cried out, \"Stop where you are, Kit Watson, or I\u0027ll give you the worst thrashing you ever had!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3010/83125.html","bookId":281,"book":{"id":281,"title":"The Young Acrobat of the Great North American Circus","description":"简介： There was great excitement in Smyrna, especially among the boys.
