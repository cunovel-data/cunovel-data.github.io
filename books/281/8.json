{"id":8559,"no":8,"title":"CHAPTER VIII. KIT\u0027S RIDE TO OAKFORD.","content":"Oakford was six miles away. The blacksmith\u0027s horse was seventeen years old, and did not make very good speed. Kit was unusually busy thinking. He had taken a decisive step; he had, in fact, made up his mind to enter upon a new life. He had not objected to going away with the blacksmith, because it gave him an excuse for packing up his clothes, and leaving the house quietly. It may be objected that he had deceived Mr. Bickford. This was true, and the thought of it troubled him, but he hardly knew how to explain matters. Not much conversation took place till they were within a mile of Oakford. Aaron Bickford had filled his pipe at the beginning of the journey, and he had smoked steadily ever since. At last he removed his pipe from his mouth, and put it in his pocket. \"Were you ever in Oakford?\" he asked.[Pg 40] \"Yes,\" answered Kit. \"I know the place very well.\" \"How do you think you\u0027ll like livin\u0027 there?\" \"I don\u0027t think I shall like it.\" Mr. Bickford looked surprised. \"I\u0027ll keep you at work so stiddy you won\u0027t mind where you are,\" he remarked dryly. \"Not if I know it,\" Kit said to himself. He knew Mr. Bickford by reputation. He was a close-fisted, miserly man, who was not likely to be a very desirable employer, for he expected every one who worked for him to labor as hard as himself. Moreover, he and his wife lived in a very stingy manner, and few of the luxuries of the season appeared on their table. The fact that complaints upon this score had been made by some of Kit\u0027s predecessors in his employ, led Mr. Bickford to make inquiries with a view to ascertaining whether Kit was particular about his food. \"Are you partic\u0027lar about your vittles?\" he asked abruptly. \"I have been accustomed to good food,\" answered Kit. \"You can\u0027t expect to live as you have at your uncle\u0027s,\" continued the blacksmith. \"Me and my wife have enough to eat, but we think it best to eat plain food. Some of my help have had stuck up notions, and expected first class hotel fare, but they didn\u0027t get it at my house.\" \"I believe you,\" said Kit. Mr. Bickford eyed him sharply, not being sure but this might be a sarcastic observation, but Kit\u0027s face was straight, and betrayed nothing. \"You\u0027ll live as well as I do myself,\" he proceeded, after a pause. \"I don\u0027t pamper my appetite by no means.\"[Pg 41] Kit was quite ready to believe this also, but did not say so. \"What time did you get up at your uncle\u0027s?\" asked the blacksmith. \"We have breakfast a little before eight. I get up in time for breakfast.\" \"You do, hey?\" ejaculated the blacksmith, scornfully. \"Wa\u0027al, I declare! You must be tuckered out gettin\u0027 up so airly.\" \"O no, I stand it very well, Mr. Bickford,\" said Kit, amused. \"Do you know what time I get up?\" asked Mr. Bickford, with a touch of indignation in his tone. \"I would like to know,\" answered Kit meekly. \"Wa\u0027al, I get up at five o\u0027clock. What do you say to that, hey?\" \"I think it is very early.\" \"I suppose you couldn\u0027t get up so early as that?\" \"I might, if there was any need of it.\" \"I reckon there will be need of it if you\u0027re goin\u0027 to work for me.\" Kit cleared his throat. He felt that the time had come for an explanation. \"Mr. Bickford,\" he said, \"I owe you an apology.\" \"What?\" said Bickford, regarding his young companion in surprise. \"I have deceived you.\" \"I don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talkin\u0027 about.\" \"I don\u0027t think I did right to come with you to day.\" \"I can\u0027t make out what you\u0027re talkin\u0027 about. Your uncle has engaged to let you work for me.\" \"But I haven\u0027t engaged to work for you, Mr. Bickford.\" \"Hey?\" and the blacksmith eyed our hero in undisguised amazement.[Pg 42] \"I may as well say that I don\u0027t intend to work for you.\" \"You don\u0027t mean to work for me?\" repeated Bickford slowly. \"Just so. I have no intention of becoming a blacksmith.\" \"Is the boy crazy?\" ejaculated Aaron Bickford. \"No, Mr. Bickford; I have full command of my senses. You will have to look out for another apprentice.\" \"Then why did you agree to come with me?\" \"That is what I have to apologize for. I wanted to get away from my uncle\u0027s house quietly, and I thought it the best way to pretend to agree to his plan.\" Aaron Bickford was not a sweet tempered man. He had a pretty strong will of his own, and was called, not without reason, obstinate. He began to feel angry. \"Well, boy, have you got through with what you had to say?\" he asked. \"I believe so—for the present.\" \"Then I guess it\u0027s about time for me to say something.\" \"Very well, sir.\" \"You\u0027ll find me a tough customer to deal with, young man.\" \"Then perhaps it is just as well that I do not propose to work for you.\" \"But you are goin\u0027 to work for me!\" said the blacksmith, nodding his head. \"Whether I want to or not?\" interrogated Kit, placidly. \"Yes, whether you want to or not, willy nilly, as the lawyers say.\"[Pg 43] \"I think, Mr. Bickford, you will find that it takes two to make a bargain.\" \"So it does, and there\u0027s two that\u0027s made this bargain, your uncle and me.\" Mr. Bickford was not always strictly grammatical in his language, as the reader will observe. \"I don\u0027t admit my uncle\u0027s right to make arrangements for me without my consent.\" \"You know more\u0027n he does, I reckon?\" \"No, but this matter concerns me more than it does him.\" \"Maybe you expect to live without workin\u0027!\" \"No; if it is true, as my uncle says, that I have no money, I shall have to make my living, but I prefer to choose my own way of doing it.\" \"You\u0027re a queer boy. Bein\u0027 a blacksmith is too much work for you, I reckon.\" \"At any rate it isn\u0027t the kind of work I care to undertake.\" \"What\u0027s all this rigmarole comin\u0027 to? Here we are \u0027most at my house. If you ain\u0027t goin\u0027 to work for me, what are you goin\u0027 to do?\" \"I should like to pass the night at your house, Mr. Bickford. After breakfast I will pay you for your accommodations, and go——\" \"Where?\" \"You must excuse my telling you that. I have formed some plans, but I do not care to have my uncle know them.\" \"Are you going to work for anybody?\" asked the blacksmith, whose curiosity was aroused. \"Yes, I have a place secured.\" \"Is it on a farm?\" \"No.\" \"You\u0027re mighty mysterious, it seems to me. Now you\u0027ve had your say, I\u0027ve got something to tell you.\"[Pg 44] \"Very well, Mr. Bickford.\" \"You say you\u0027re not goin\u0027 to work for me?\" \"Yes, sir.\" \"Then I say you are goin\u0027 to work for me. I\u0027ve got your uncle\u0027s authority to set you to work, and I\u0027m goin\u0027 to do it.\" Kit heard this calmly. \"Suppose we postpone the discussion of the matter,\" he said. \"Is that your house?\" Aaron Bickford\u0027s answer was to drive into the yard of a cottage. On the side opposite was a blacksmith\u0027s forge. \"That\u0027s where you\u0027re goin\u0027 to work!\" he said, grimly, pointing to the forge. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/3010/83123.html","bookId":281,"book":{"id":281,"title":"The Young Acrobat of the Great North American Circus","description":"简介： There was great excitement in Smyrna, especially among the boys.
