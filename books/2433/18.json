{"id":78393,"no":18,"title":"Page 18","content":"\u0027I came to kill you, Momma. And you were waiting here to kill me. Momma, I ... it\u0027s not right, Momma. It\u0027s not ... \u0027 \u0027Let\u0027s pray,\u0027 Momma said softly. Her eyes fixed on Carrie\u0027s and there was a crazed, awful compassion in them. The fire light was brighter now, dancing on the walls Up dervishes. \u0027For the last time, let us pray.\u0027 \u0027Oh Momma help me!\u0027 Carrie cried out. She fell forward on her knees, head down, hands raised in supplication. Momma leaned forward, and the knife came down in a shining arc. Carrie, perhaps seeing out of the tail of her eye, jerked back, and instead of penetrating her back, the knife went into her shoulder to the hilt. Momma\u0027s feet tangled in the legs of her chair, and she collapsed in a sitting sprawl. They stared at each other in silent tableau. Blood began to ooze from around the handle of the knife and to splash on to the floor. Then Carrie said softly: \u0027I\u0027m going to give you a present, Momma.\u0027 Margaret tried to get up, staggered, and fell back on her hands and knees. \u0027What are you doing?\u0027 she croaked hoarsely. \u0027I\u0027m picturing your heart, Momma,\u0027 Carrie said. \u0027It\u0027s easier when you see things in your mind. Your heart is a big red muscle. Mine goes faster when I use my power. But your is going a little slower now. A little slower.\u0027 Margaret tried to get up again, failed, and forked the sign of the evil eye at her daughter. \u0027A little slower, Momma. Do you know what the present is, Momma? What you always wanted. Darkness. And whatever God lives there.\u0027 Margaret White whispered: \u0027Our father, Who art in heaven-\u0027 \u0027Slower, Momma. Slower.\u0027 \u0027-hallowed be Thy name-\u0027 \u0027I can see the blood draining back into you. Slower.\u0027 \u0027-Thy Kingdom come-\u0027 \u0027Your feet and hands like marble, like alabaster. White.\u0027 \u0027-Thy will be done-\u0027 \u0027My will, Momma. Slower!\u0027 \u0027-on earth-\u0027 \u0027Slower.\u0027 \u0027-as ... as ... as it...\u0027 She collapsed forward, hands twitching. \u0027-as it is in heaven.\u0027 Carrie whispered: \u0027Full stop.\u0027 She looked down at herself, and put her hands weakly around the haft of the knife. (no o no that hurts that\u0027s too much hurt) She tried to get up, failed, then pulled herself up by Momma\u0027s stool. Dizziness and nausea washed over her. She could taste blood, bright and slick, on the back of her throat. Smoke, acrid and choking, was drifting in through the windows now. The flames had reached next door; even now sparks would be lighting softly on the roof that rocks had punched brutally through a thousand years before. Carrie went out the back door, staggered across the lawn, and rested (where\u0027s my momma) against a tree. There was something she was supposed to do. Something about (roadhouses parking lots) the Angel with the Sword. The Fiery Sword. Never mind. It would come to her. She crossed by back yards to Willow Street and then crawled up the embankment to Route 6. It was 1: 15 A.M. It was 11:20 P.M. when Christine Hargensen and Billy Nolan got back to The Cavalier. They went up the back stairs, down the hall, and before she could do more than turn on the lights, he was yanking at her blouse. \u0027For God\u0027s sake let me unbutton it-\u0027 \u0027To hell with that.\u0027 He ripped it suddenly down the back. The cloth tore with a sudden hard sound. One button popped free and winked on the bare wood floor. Honky-tonkin\u0027 music came faintly up to them, and the building vibrated subtly with the clumsy-enthusiastic dancing of farmers and truckers and millworkers and waitresses and hairdressers, of the greasers and their townie girl friends from Westover and Motton. \u0027Hey-\u0027 \u0027Be quiet.\u0027 He slapped her, rocking her head back. Her eyes took on a flat and deadly shine. \u0027This is the end, Billy.\u0027 She backed away from him, breasts swelling into her bra, flat stomach pumping, legs long and tapering in her jeans; but she backed toward the bed. \u0027It\u0027s over.\u0027 \u0027Sure,\u0027 he said. He lunged for her and she punched him, a surprising hard punch that landed on his cheek. He straightened and twitched his head a little. \u0027You gave me a shiner, you bitch.\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ll give you more.\u0027 \u0027You\u0027re goddam right you will.\u0027 They stared at each other, panting, glaring. Then he began to unbutton his shirt, a little grin beginning on his face. \u0027We got it on, Charlie. We really got it on.\u0027 He called her Charlie whenever he was pleased with her. It seemed to be, she thought with a cold blink of humour, a generic term for good cunt. She felt a little smile come to her own face, relaxed a little, and that was when he whipped his shirt across her face and came in low, butting her in the stomach like a goat, tipping her on to the bed. The springs screamed. She pounded her fists helplessly on his back. \u0027Get off me! Get off me! Get off me! You fucking greaseball, get off me!\u0027 He was grinning at her, and with one quick, hard yank her zipper was broken, her hips free. \u0027Call your daddy?\u0027 he was grunting. \u0027That what you gonna do? Huh? Huh? That it, ole Chuckie? Call big ole legal beagle daddy? Huh? I woulda done it to you, you know that? I woulda dumped it all over your fuckin squash. You know it? Huh? Know it? Pig blood for pigs, right? Right on your motherfucking squash. You-\u0027 She had suddenly ceased to resist. He paused, staring down at her, and she had an odd smile on her face. \u0027You wanted it this way all along, didn\u0027t you? You miserable little scumbag. That\u0027s right, isn\u0027t it? You creepy little onenut low-cock dinkless wonder.\u0027 His grin was slow, crazed. \u0027It doesn\u0027t matter.\u0027 \u0027No,\u0027 she said. \u0027It doesn\u0027t.\u0027 Her smile suddenly vanished, the cords on her neck stood out as she hawked back - and spat in his face. They descended into a red, thrashing unconsciousness. Downstairs the music thumped and wheezed (\u0027I\u0027m poppin little white pills an my eyes are open wide/Six days on the road and I\u0027m gonna make it home tonight!\u0027), c/w, full throttle, very loud, very bad, five-man band wearing sequined cowboy shirts and new pegged jeans with bright rivets, occasionally wiping mixed sweat and Vitalis from their brows, lead guitar, rhythm, steel, dobro guitar, drums; no one heard the town whistle, or the first explosion, or the second; and when the gas main blew and the music stopped and someone drove into the parking lot and began to yell the news, Chris and Billy were asleep. Chris woke suddenly and the clock on the night table said five minutes of one. Someone was pounding on the door. \u0027Billy!\u0027 the voice was yelling. \u0027Get up! Hey! Hey!\u0027 Billy stirred, rolled over, and knocked the cheap alarm clock on to the floor. \u0027What the Christ?\u0027 he said thickly, and sat up. His back stung. The bitch had covered it with long scratches. He\u0027d barely noticed it at the time, but now decided he was going to have to send her home bowlegged. Just to show her who was boss.. Silence struck him. Silence. The Cavalier did not close until two; as a matter of fact, he could still see the neon twinkling and flicking through the dusty garret window. Except for the steady pounding (something happened) the place was a graveyard. \u0027Billy, you in there? Hey!\u0027 \u0027Who is it?\u0027 Chris whispered. Her eyes were glittering and watchful in the intermittent neon. \u0027Jackie Talbot,\u0027 he said absently, then raised his voice. \u0027What?\u0027 \u0027Lemme in, Billy. I got to talk to you!\u0027 Billy got up and padded to the door, naked. He unlocked the old-fashioned hook-and-eye and opened it. Jackie Talbot burst in. His eyes were wild and his face was smeared with soot. He had been drinking it up with Steve and Henry when the news came at ten minutes of twelve. They had gone back to town in Henry\u0027s elderly Dodge convertible, and had seen the Jackson Avenue gas main explode from the vantage point of Brickyard Hill. When Jackie had borrowed the Dodge and started to drive back at 12:30, the town was a panicky shambles. \u0027Chamberlain\u0027s burning up,\u0027 he said to Billy. \u0027Whole fuckin town. The school\u0027s gone. The Centre\u0027s gone. West End blew up - gas. And Carlin Street\u0027s on fire. And they\u0027re saying Carrie White did it!\u0027 \u0027Oh God,\u0027 Chris said. She started to get out of bed and grope for her clothes. \u0027What did-\u0027 \u0027Shut up,\u0027 Billy said mildly, \u0027or I\u0027ll kick your ass.\u0027 He looked at Jackie again and nodded for him to go on. \u0027They seen her. Lots of people seen her. Billy, they say she\u0027s all covered with blood. She was at that fuckin prom tonight... Steve and Henry didn\u0027t get it but ... Billy, did you ... that pig blood ... was it-\u0027 \u0027Yeah,\u0027 Billy said. \u0027Oh, no.\u0027 Jackie stumbled back against the doorframe. His face was a sickly yellow in the light of the one hall lightbulb. \u0027Oh Jesus, Billy, the whole town-.\u0027 \u0027Carrie trashed the whole town? Carrie White? You\u0027re full of shit.\u0027 He said it calmly, almost serenely. Behind him, Chris was dressing rapidly. \u0027Go and look out the window,\u0027 Jackie said. Billy went over and looked out. The entire eastern horizon had gone crimson, and the sky was alight with it. Even as he looked, three fire trucks screamed by. He could make out the names on them in the glow of the street light that marked The Cavalier\u0027s parking lot. \u0027Son of a whore,\u0027 he said. \u0027Those trucks are from Brunswick.\u0027 \u0027Brunswick?\u0027 Chris said. \u0027That\u0027s forty miles away. That can\u0027t be . . .\u0027 Billy turned back to Jackie Talbot. \u0027All right. What happened?\u0027 Jackie shook his head. \u0027Nobody knows, not yet. It started at the high school. Carrie and Tommy Ross got the King and Queen, and then somebody dumped a couple of buckets of blood on them and she ran out. Then the school caught on fire, and they say nobody got out. Then Teddy\u0027s Amoco blew up, then that Mobil station on Summer Street-!\u0027 \u0027Citgo.\u0027 Billy corrected. \u0027It\u0027s a Citgo.\u0027 \u0027Who the fuck cares?\u0027 Jackie screamed. \u0027It was her, every place something happened it was her! And those buckets ... none of us wore gloves...\u0027 \u0027I\u0027ll take care of it,\u0027 Billy said. \u0027You don\u0027t get it, Billy. Carrie \u0027Get out.\u0027 \u0027Billy-\u0027 \u0027Get out or I\u0027ll break your arm and feed it to you.\u0027 Jackie backed out of the door warily. \u0027Go home. Don\u0027t talk to nobody. I\u0027m going to take care of everything.\u0027 \u0027All right,\u0027 Jackie said. \u0027Okay. Billy, I just thought-\u0027 Billy slammed the door. Chris was on him in a second. \u0027Billy what are we going to do that bitch Carrie oh my Lord what are we going to-\u0027 Billy slapped her, getting his whole arm into it, and knocked her on to the floor. Chris sat sprawled in stunned silence for a moment, and then held her face and began to sob. Billy put on his pants, his tee shirt, his boots. Then he went to the chipped porcelain washstand in the corner, clicked on the light, wet his head, and began to comb his hair, bending down to see his reflection in the spotted, ancient mirror. Behind him, wavy and distorted, Chris Hargensen sat on the floor, wiping blood from her split lip. \u0027I\u0027ll tell you what we\u0027re going to do,\u0027 he said. \u0027We\u0027re going into town and watch the fires. Then we\u0027re coming home. You\u0027re going to tell your dear old daddy that we were out to The Cavalier drinking beers when it happened. I\u0027m gonna tell my dear ole mummy the same thing. Dig.\u0027 \u0027Billy, your fingerprints,\u0027 she said. Her voice was muffled, but respectful. \u0027Their fingerprints,\u0027 he said. \u0027I wore gloves.\u0027 \u0027Would they tell?\u0027 she asked. \u0027If the police took them in and questioned them-\u0027 \u0027Sure,\u0027 he said. \u0027They\u0027d tell.\u0027 The loops and swirls were almost right. They glistened in the light of the dun, flyspecked globe like eddies on deep water. His face was calm, reposeful. The comb he used was a battered old Ace, clotted with grease. His father had given it to him on -his eleventh birthday, and not one tooth was broken in it. Not one. \u0027Maybe they\u0027ll never find the buckets,\u0027 he said. \u0027If they do, maybe the fingerprints will all be burnt of. I don\u0027t know. But if Doyle takes any of \u0027em in, I\u0027m heading for California. You do what you want.\u0027 \u0027Would you take me with you?\u0027 she asked. She looked at him from the floor, her lip puffed to negroid size, her eyes pleading.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/carrie/page-18.html","bookId":2433,"book":{"id":2433,"title":"Carrie","description":"Storyline: A modern classic, Carrie introduced a distinctive new voice in American fiction — Stephen King.
