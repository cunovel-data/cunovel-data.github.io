Supper!\u0027\n \u0027Thank you,\n (i am not afraid)\n Momma.\u0027\n She got up and fixed her hair with a dark-blue headband. Then she went downstairs\n From The Shadow Exploded (p. 59):\n How apparent was Carrie\u0027s \u0027wild talent\u0027 and what did Margaret White, with her extreme Christian ethic, think of it? We shall probably never know. But one is tempted to believe that Mrs White\u0027s reaction must have been extreme ...\n \u0027You haven\u0027t touched your pie, Carrie.\u0027 Momma looked up from the tract she had been perusing while she drank her Constant Comment. \u0027It\u0027s homemade.\u0027\n \u0027It makes me have pimples, Momma.\u0027\n \u0027Your pimples are the Lord\u0027s way of chastising you. Now eat your pie.\u0027\n \u0027Momma?\u0027\n \u0027Yes?\u0027\n Carrie plunged. \u0027I\u0027ve been invited to the Spring Ball next Friday by Tommy Ross-\u0027\n The tract was forgotten. Momma was staring at her with wide my ears-are-deceiving-me eyes. Her nostrils flared like those of a horse that has heard the dry rattle of a snake.\n Carrie tried to swallow an obstruction and only\n (i am not afraid o yes i am)\n got rid of part of it.\n \u0027-and he\u0027s a very nice boy. He\u0027s promised to stop in and meet you before and-\u0027\n \u0027No.\u0027\n \u0027-to have me in by eleven. I\u0027ve-\u0027\n \u0027No, no, no!\u0027\n \u0027-accepted. Momma, please see that I have to start to, to try and get along with the world. I\u0027m not like you. I\u0027m funny - I mean, the kids think I\u0027m funny. I don\u0027t want to be. I want to try and be a whole person before it\u0027s too late to-\u0027\n Mrs White threw her tea in Carrie\u0027s face.\n It was only lukewarm, but it could not have shut of Carrie\u0027s words more suddenly if it had been scalding. She sat numbly, the amber fluid dripping from her chin and cheeks on to her white blouse, spreading. It was sticky and smelled like cinnamon.\n Mrs White sat trembling, her face frozen except for her nostrils, which continued to flare. Abruptly she threw back her head and screamed at the ceiling.\n \u0027God! God! God!\u0027 Her jaw snapped brutally over each syllable.\n Carrie sat without moving.\n Mrs White got up and came around the table. Her hands were hooked into shaking claws. Her face bore a half-mad expression of compassion mixed with hate.\n \u0027The closet,\u0027 she said. \u0027Go to your closet and pray.\u0027\n \u0027No, Momma.\u0027\n \u0027Boys. Yes, boys come next. After the blood the boys come. Like sniffing dogs, grinning and slobbering, trying to find out where that smell is. That ... smell!\u0027\n She swung her whole arm into the blow, and the sound of her palm against Carrie\u0027s face\n (o god i am so afraid now)\n was like that flat sound of a leather belt being snapped in air. Carrie remained seated, although her upper body swayed. The mark on her cheek was first white, then blood red.\n \u0027The mark,\u0027 Mrs White said. Her eyes were large but blank, she was breathing in rapid, snatching gulps of air. She seemed to be talking to herself as the claw hand descended on to Carrie\u0027s shoulder and pulled her out of her chair.\n \u0027I\u0027ve seen it, all right. Oh yes. But. I. Never. Did. But for him. He. Took. Me . . .\u0027 She paused, her eyes wandering vaguely toward the ceiling. Carrie was terrified. Momma seemed in the throes of some great revelation which might destroy her.\n \u0027Momma-\u0027\n \u0027In cars. Oh, I know where they take you in their arms. City limits. Roadhouses. Whiskey. Smelling ... oh they smell it on you!\u0027 Her voice rose to a scream. Tendons stood out on her neck, and her head twisted in a questing upward rotation.\n \u0027Momma, you better stop.\u0027\n This seemed to snap her back to some kind of hazy reality. Her lips twitched in a kind of elementary surprise and she halted, as if groping for old bearings in a new world.\n \u0027The closet,\u0027 she, muttered. \u0027Go to your closet and pray.\n \u0027No.\u0027\n Momma raised her hand to strike.\n \u0027No!\u0027\n The hand stopped in the dead air. Momma stared up at it, as if to confirm that it was still there, and whole.\n The pie pan suddenly rose from the trivet on the table and hurled itself across the room to impact beside the living-room door in a splash of blueberry drool.\n \u0027I\u0027m going, Momma!\u0027\n Momma\u0027s overturned teacup rose and flew past her head to shatter above the stove. Momma shrieked and dropped to her knees with her hands over her head.\n \u0027Devil\u0027s child,\u0027 she moaned. \u0027Devil\u0027s child. Satan spawn-\u0027\n \u0027Momma, stand up.\u0027\n \u0027Lust and licentiousness, the cravings of the flesh-\u0027\n \u0027Stand up!\u0027\n Momma\u0027s voice faded her but she did stand up, with her hands still on her head, like a prisoner of war.\n Her lips moved. To Carrie she seemed to be reciting the Lord\u0027s ]Prayer.\n \u0027I don\u0027t want to fight with you, Momma,\u0027 Carrie said, and her voice almost broke from her and dissolved. She struggled to control it. \u0027I only want to be let to live my own life. I... I don\u0027t like yours.\u0027 She stopped, horrified in spite of herself. The ultimate blasphemy had been spoken, and it was a thousand times worse than the Eff Word.\n \u0027Witch,\u0027 Momma whispered. \u0027It says in the Lord\u0027s Book: \"Thou shalt not suffer a witch to bye.\" Your father did the Lord\u0027s work-\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t want to talk about that,\u0027 Carrie said. It always disturbed her to hear Momma talk about her father. \u0027I just want you to understand that things are going to change around here, Momma.\u0027 Her eyes gleamed. \u0027They better understand it, too.\u0027\n But Momma was whispering to herself again.\n Unsatisfied, with a feeling of anticlimax in her throat and the dismal rolling of emotional upset in her belly, she went to the cellar to get her dress material.\n It was better than the closet. There was that. Anything was better than the closet with its blue light and the overpowering stench of sweat and her own sin. Anything. Everything.\n She stood with the wrapped package hugged against her breast and closed her eyes, shutting out the weak glow of the cellar\u0027s bare, cobweb-festooned bulb. Tommy Ross didn\u0027t love her, she knew that. This was some strange kind of atonement, and she could understand that and respond to it. She had lain cheek and jowl with the concept of penance since she had been old enough to reason.\n He had said it would be good-that they would see to it. Well, she would see to it. They better not start anything. They just better not. She did not know if her gift had come from the lord of light or of darkness, and now, finally finding that she did not care which, she was overcome with an almost indescribable relief, as if a huge weight, long carried, had slipped from her shoulders.\n Upstairs, Momma continued to whisper. It was not the Lord\u0027s Prayer. It was the Prayer of Exorcism from Deuteronomy.\n From My Name Is Susan Snell (p. 23):\n They finally even made a movie about it. I saw it last April. When I came out, I was sick. Whenever anything important happens in America, they have to gold-plate it, like baby shoes. That way you can forget it. And forgetting Carrie White may be a bigger mistake than anyone realizes ...\n Monday morning: Principal Grayle and his understudy, Pete Morton, were having coffee in Grayle\u0027s office.\n \u0027No word from Hargensen yet?\u0027 Morty asked. His lips curled into a John Wayne leer that was a little frightened around the edges.\n \u0027Not a peep. And Christine has stopped lipping off about how her father is going to send us down the road.\u0027 Grayle blew on his coffee with a long face.\n \u0027You don\u0027t exactly seem to be turning cartwheels.\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027m not. Did you know Carrie White is going to the prom?\u0027\n Morty blinked. \u0027With who? The Beak?\u0027 The Beak was Freddy Holt, another of Ewen\u0027s misfits. He weighed perhaps one hundred pounds soaking wet, and the casual observer might be tempted to believe that sixty of it was nose.\n \u0027No,\u0027 Grayle said. \u0027With Tommy Ross.\u0027\n Morty swallowed his coffee the wrong way and went into a coughing fit.\n \u0027That\u0027s the way I felt,\u0027 Grayle said.\n \u0027What about his girl friend? The little Snell girl?\u0027\n I think she put him up to it,\u0027 Grayle said. \u0027She certainly seemed guilty enough about what happened to Carrie when I talked to her. Now she\u0027s on the Decoration Committee, happy as a clam, just as if not going to her Senior prom was nothing at all.\u0027\n \u0027Oh,\u0027 Morty said wisely.\n \u0027And Hargensen - I think he must have talked to some people and discovered we really could sue him on behalf of Carrie White if we wanted to. I think he\u0027s cut his losses. It\u0027s the daughter that\u0027s worrying me.\u0027\n \u0027Do you think there\u0027s going to be an incident Friday night?\u0027\n \u0027I don\u0027t know. I do know Chris has got a lot of friends who are going to be there. And she\u0027s going around with that Billy Nolan mess; he\u0027s got a zooful of friends, too. The kind that make a career out of scaring pregnant ladies. Chris Hargensen has him tied around her finger, from what I\u0027ve heard.\u0027\n \u0027Are you afraid of anything specific?\u0027\n Grayle made a restless gesture. \u0027Specific? No. But I\u0027ve been in the game long enough to know it\u0027s a bad situation. Do you remember the Stadler game in seventy-six?\u0027\n Morty nodded. It would take more than the passage of three years to obscure the memory of the Ewen-Stadler game. Bruce Trevor had been a marginal student but a fantastic basketball player. Coach Gaines didn\u0027t like him, but Trevor was going to put Ewen in the area tournament for the first time in ten years. He was cut from the team a week before Ewen\u0027s but must-win game against the Stadler Bobcats. A regular announced locker inspection had uncovered a kilo of marijuana behind Trevor\u0027s civic book. Ewen lost the game - and their shot at the tourney - 104-48. But no one remembered that; what they remembered was the riot that had interrupted the game in the fourth period. Led by Bruce Trevor, who righteously claimed he had been bum rapped, it resulted in four hospital admissions. One of them had been the Stadler coach, who had been hit over the head with a first-aid kit.\n \u0027I\u0027ve got that kind of feeling,\u0027 Grayle said. \u0027A hunch. Someone\u0027s going to come with rotten apples or something.\u0027\n \u0027Maybe you\u0027re psychic,\u0027 Morty said.\n From The Shadow Exploded (pp. 92-93):\n It is now generally agreed that the TK phenomenon is a geneticrecessive occurrence - but the opposite of a disease like haemophilia, which becomes overt only in males. In that disease, once called \u0027King\u0027s Evil,\u0027 the gene is recessive in the female and is carried harmlessly. Male offspring, however, are \u0027bleeders.\u0027 This disease is generated only if an afflicted male marries a woman carrying the recessive gene. If the offspring of such union is male, the result will be a haemophiliac son. If the offspring is female, the result will be a daughter who is a carrier. It should be emphasized that the haemophilia gene may be carried recessively in the male as a part of his genetic make-up. But if he marries a woman with the same outlaw gene, the result will be haemophilia if the offspring is male.\n In the case of royal families, where intermarriage was common, the chances of the gene reproducing once it entered the family tree were high - thus the name King\u0027s Evil. Haemophilia also showed up in significant quantities in Appalachia during the earlier part of this century, and is commonly noticed in those cultures where incest and the marriage of first cousins is common.\n With the TK phenomenon, the male appears to be the carrier.. the TK gene may be recessive in the female, but dominates only in the female. It appears that Ralph White carried the gene. Margaret Brigham, by purest name, also carried the outlaw gene sign, but we may be fairly confident that it was recessive, as no information has ever been found to indicate that she had telekinetic powers resembling her daughter\u0027s. Investigations are now being conducted into the life of Margaret Brigham\u0027s grandmother, Sadie Cochran - for, if the dominant/recessive pattern obtains with TK as it does with haemophilia, Mrs Cochran must have been TK-dominant.\n If the issue of the White marriage had been male, the result would have been another carrier. Chances that the mutation would have died with him would have been excellent, as neither side of the Ralph White - Margaret Brigham alliance had cousins of a comparable age for the theoretical male offspring to marry. And the chances of meeting and marrying another woman with TK gene at random would be small. None of the teams working on the problem have yet isolated the gene.\n Surely no one can doubt, in light of the Maine holocaust, that isolating this gene must become one of medicine\u0027s number-one priorities. The haemophiliac, or H-gene, produces male issue with a lack of blood platelets. The telekineticn or TK-gene, produces female Typhoid Marys capable of destroying almost at will ...\n Wednesday afternoon.\n Susan and fourteen other students - The Spring Ball Decoration Committee, no less - were working on the huge mural that would hang behind the twin bandstand on Friday night. The theme was Springtime in Venice (who picked thew hokey themes, Sue wondered. She had been a student at Ewen for four years, had after two Balls, and she still didn\u0027t know. Why did the goddam thing need a theme, anyway? Why not just have a sock hop and be done with W): George Chizmar, Ewen\u0027s most artistic student, had done a small chalk sketch of gondolas on a canal at sunset and a gondolier in a huge straw fedora leaning against the tiller as a gorgeous panoply of pinks and reds and oranges stained both sky and water. It was beautiful, no doubt about that. He had redrawn it in silhouette on a huge fourteen-by-twenty-foot canvas flat, numbering the various sections to go with the various chalk hues. Now the Committee was patiently colouring it in, like children crawling over a huge page in a giant\u0027s colouring book. Still, Sue thought, looking at her hands and forearms, both heavily dusted with pink chalk, it was going to be the prettiest prom ever.\n Next to her, Helen Shyres sat up on her haunches, stretched, and groaned as her back popped. She brushed a hank of hair from her forehead with the back of her hand, leaving a rose-coloured smear.\n \u0027How in hell did you talk me into this?\u0027\n \u0027You want it to be nice, don\u0027t you?\u0027 Sue mimicked Miss Geer, the spinster chairman (apt enough term for Miss Mustache) of the Decoration Committee.\n \u0027Yeah, but why not the refreshment Committee or the Entertainment Committee? Less back, more mind. The mind, that\u0027s my area. Besides, you\u0027re not even -\u0027 She bit down on the words.\n \u0027Going?\u0027 Susan shrugged and picked up her chalk again. She had a monstrous writer\u0027s cramp. \u0027No, but I still want it to be nice.\u0027 She added shyly: \u0027Tommy\u0027s going.\u0027\n They worked in silence for a bit, and then Helen stopped again. No one was near them; the closest was Holly Marshall, on the other end of the mural, colouring the gondola\u0027s keel.\n \u0027Can I ask you about it, Sue?\u0027 Helen asked finally. \u0027God, everybody\u0027s talking.\u0027\n \u0027Sure.\u0027 Sue stopped colouring and flexed her hand.\n \u0027Maybe I ought to tell someone, just so the story stays straight. I asked Tommy to take Carrie. I\u0027m hoping it\u0027ll bring her out of herself a little ... knock down some of the barriers. I think I owe her that much.\u0027\n \u0027Whom does that put the rest of us?\u0027 Helen asked without rancour.\n Sue shrugged. \u0027You have to make up your own mind about what we did, Helen. I\u0027m in no position to throw stones. But I don\u0027t want people to think I\u0027m uh ...\u0027 \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/carrie/page-8.html","bookId":2433,"book":{"id":2433,"title":"Carrie","description":"Storyline: \n A modern classic, Carrie introduced a distinctive new voice in American fiction — Stephen King.
