{"id":109425,"no":23,"title":"Page 23","content":"I decided it would be best not to mention the twins thing to Kiyo. As it was, I was having a hard enough time processing it.\n Twins.\n Twins?\n This was the ultimate \"when it rains, it pours\" cliche. I\u0027d gotten pregnant through an idiotic slip, putting me right in the line of the prophecy I\u0027d tried to avoid for so long. And now, just when I\u0027d managed to coax an early test so I could nip this situation in the bud, I was faced with a potential situation that I never, never could have foreseen.\n Kiyo had been right. I should have terminated the pregnancy the instant I found out, before I knew more about it. It was becoming real now. Every detail I learned made it more substantial, giving more life to what I carried within me. It\u0027s not too late. You don\u0027t have to wait for the results. Maybe it\u0027s better if you don\u0027t.\n I\u0027d boldly told Jasmine that I\u0027d keep the twins if they were girls, but the reality of that was harsh. How would I raise two children? I didn\u0027t know if I could handle one. How could I manage motherhood when half my life was spent in another world? How could I even keep working? Would I get a nanny - or force my kids onto someone like Tim or my mom? That latter seemed pretty unlikely. And then, of course, I was faced with the most mundane problem of all.\n Money.\n \"You\u0027re going to be in serious trouble if you don\u0027t start working again soon,\" Lara told me the day after I\u0027d seen the doctor. She\u0027d spent the night again and was sitting at my kitchen table with me. In front of her, a laptop showed an array of spreadsheets. \"You\u0027re still okay ... but it won\u0027t last. Part of your money goes into the business\u0027s account - the one I\u0027m paid from. The other profits go to your savings. The first one\u0027s running pretty low ... and if it goes empty ...\"\n \"We go into my savings,\" I finished.\n She nodded. Her face was grim, a far cry from the giddiness she\u0027d shown when she and Tim had stumbled out of bed this morning. A bitter part of me thought maybe I could pick up extra cash by charging her rent. I dismissed that, of course. None of this was her fault.\n \"I know there\u0027s ... stuff ... going on, Eugenie, but why can\u0027t you start taking more jobs? You cut the workload before, and we still did okay, but now ... there\u0027s next to nothing. Your savings can\u0027t hold out that long. And what on earth did Enrique do that got us such a large bill?\"\n I ignored that and simply stared at the numbers on the screen, my heart sinking. \"I\u0027ve got a lot of equity in the house.\"\n \"What?\" Her jaw nearly dropped. \"You\u0027d risk your house instead of just taking on more work?\"\n A terrible image came to my mind: me, trapped in some small apartment with two screaming babies. End it, just end it.\n \"It\u0027s just an option,\" I pointed out. \"A safety net. And speaking of which ... Did you talk to Enrique?\"\n Lara nodded. \"I did. I\u0027m going to do a little administrative work for him on the side.\"\n \"Good.\" One less thing to feel guilty about. \"You\u0027ll be okay then.\"\n \"This isn\u0027t about me! I don\u0027t understand. Why can\u0027t you just take a couple of jobs? I\u0027ve got reams of requests! There are easy ones, like that ghost the other day.\"\n I tried to hide my dismay at that. \"I haven\u0027t been feeling well, that\u0027s all. And this is kind of a physical line of work.\"\n Lara\u0027s blue eyes scrutinized me for several seconds. \"Then maybe you\u0027re the one who needs to be looking for another job.\"\n \"No!\" I exclaimed. \"This is what I do. It\u0027s the only thing I do.\"\n \"But if you\u0027re sick - \"\n \"I\u0027m fine. I\u0027m seeing the doctor tomorrow and then ...\" I faltered. And then what? \"And then I\u0027ll be fine. Back to work. My appointment\u0027s at noon, so hell, you could schedule something later that afternoon. Find me a troll or a banshee.\"\n She sighed. \"I didn\u0027t mean to upset you.\"\n \"I\u0027m not upset.\" But it was a lie. My volume had increased without my realizing it, and I felt flushed.\n Lara rose, shutting the laptop and picking up her plate. \"Just get yourself better. We can figure this out then. Do you need a ride or anything tomorrow?\"\n \"I\u0027m not that sick,\" I told her. And, of course, I could always have my unlicensed teenage sister drive me. \"We\u0027ll be back in business again soon, you\u0027ll see.\"\n Lara gave me a tight smile, trying to hide concern but failing. She wandered off to Tim\u0027s bedroom, and Jasmine sat up on the couch, where she\u0027d overheard everything. \"That\u0027s a good idea, you know,\" she said. \"Sell this place. Just move to the Otherworld with the kids.\"\n I started to rebuke her but paused. It was an option. I\u0027d have plenty of daycare there - a whole castle of babysitters. My daughters would be raised like royalty. They were royalty. But raising them there meant they\u0027d probably lose whatever humanity was in them. They would be gentry for all intents and purposes. Was that what I wanted? It was already happening to me.\n \"They may be boys,\" I reminded Jasmine. \"Then it\u0027s back to work.\"\n Kiyo called that night, wanting to know if I\u0027d heard anything. I told him it was too soon for the results but that I\u0027d let him know when the doctor called. It was a small lie. As I\u0027d slipped to Lara, I was actually going back to the office for the results. Twins had popped me into a high-risk category, apparently, and along with delivering the results in person, they\u0027d wanted to do another ultrasound. I didn\u0027t want Kiyo around for that, obviously, but I wouldn\u0027t have minded him coming over that night. I wanted the contact, the love. Most importantly, I wanted to feel like he wasn\u0027t repulsed by me in my current state.\n When noon came the next day, I went like someone going to her own funeral. My mind was blank, unable to focus on anything, and Jasmine probably would have been a safer driver. She\u0027d come along; there\u0027d been no discussion. Neither of us spoke on the drive over, and I could see she was wound just as tightly with tension. Whatever happened, it was going to be big.\n \"Soon,\" I murmured as we walked in. \"Soon this\u0027ll be over, one way or another.\"\n Or not so soon.\n The office was running behind, and it was like the continuation of some cosmic joke. I\u0027d been counting down the seconds until this moment, and now the wait was indefinite while Dr. Sartori caught up with his schedule. Admittedly, I\u0027d never felt angry at doctors who fell behind. I figured it just meant they were giving needed time and care to their patients. Maybe he was tied up because some other woman had discovered she was having a world-conquering monster.\n \"Eugenie?\" The sound of my name made me flinch. A nurse smiled serenely at me. \"We\u0027re ready for you.\"\n It was a repeat of before, changing into a gown and getting on the examination table. This is it, this is it. Dr. Sartori was back, but a different tech worked today. Her name was Ruth, and she had a kindly, almost grandmotherly air that felt reassuring. Like she could maybe fix all this.\n Dr. Sartori had a file of papers he began flipping through as Ruth lubed up my stomach. Again, I stared, still having a hard time believing there were two living beings in there.\n \"Well,\" he said. \"I have good news.\"\n Jasmine made a sound that almost sounded like a laugh. A bitter one, that is. Like me, she knew there was little that was going to be good here. In fact, things soon got worse.\n A knock sounded at the door, and the nurse I\u0027d seen earlier stuck her head in. \"I\u0027m sorry to interrupt you,\" she said. Her eyes fell on me. \"There\u0027s a man here who says he\u0027s your boyfriend and that he was running late for the exam.\"\n My mouth went dry. \"Kiyo?\" I managed.\n \"That\u0027s him. I\u0027ll go get him.\"\n She\u0027d taken my ID of Kiyo as confirmation and acceptance. I opened my mouth to protest, but she was gone. I started to tell one of the others to go stop her, but by that point, Ruth\u0027s paddle had made contact. The screen again showed shadowy forms, and the sound of those rapid heartbeats filled the room.\n \"There they are,\" said Dr. Sartori. \"We can wait for your boyfriend before getting to the results.\"\n \"No, we - \"\n The nurse returned with Kiyo, who was all charm and smiles as he introduced himself. \"Sorry I\u0027m late. I had the time wrong. Lara corrected me.\" That last part was to me, and despite the pleasant expression on his face, I saw a hard look in his eyes. He didn\u0027t like the deception. I had kept this from him, lying about when I\u0027d get the results.\n How had he found me? Lara had known the time but not the place. For a moment, I thought Jasmine might be playing a game, but her face showed shock and wariness at his arrival. She was as surprised as me. The referral, I realized. He\u0027d read it before and knew which doctor I was seeing.\n \"Well, then,\" continued Dr. Sartori. \"Now that we\u0027re all here, we can go over everything. You can rest easy about your family history. No trace of anything abnormal in either one. Both of the fetuses\u0027 genetic tests came back fine.\"\n It was a sign of Kiyo\u0027s self-control that he said nothing because I could have sworn the word both? was on his lips. His only reaction was another sharp look at me, his expression growing darker as he realized what I\u0027d been hiding. The doctor and tech were watching the monitor, so they didn\u0027t see what Jasmine and I did.\n \"And you know ... you know the gender?\" I asked.\n Dr. Sartori nodded. \"You can\u0027t actually see it on the ultrasound now, but the one Ruth\u0027s got a close-up of now ... that\u0027s a girl.\" I exhaled in relief, and yet ... somehow, I knew what his next words would be as Ruth shifted to the other amorphous blob. \"And this one\u0027s a boy.\"\n Silence so cold and so heavy fell that I couldn\u0027t believe neither of the office\u0027s staff noticed the lack of joy this news was receiving.\n \"A girl,\" said Kiyo. \"And a boy.\"\n Dr. Sartori nodded, flipping through a few more pages. \"Based on what you\u0027ve told us and what we can see, we\u0027re putting your due date around the end of October. Although, with twins, you\u0027re at a higher risk for early delivery, so we\u0027ll be seeing you more often than in a normal pregnancy. And while this test gives us a lot of info, it doesn\u0027t tell everything, so you\u0027ll have others soon. You haven\u0027t had any pain since the CVS, have you? Any reactions?\"\n \"No,\" I said flatly. My eyes were on those images, my world dominated by those heartbeats.\n \"Good. You\u0027ll still want to take it easy to avoid any miscarriage risk.\"\n He went over a few more issues, told me when to come back, and then asked if we had any questions. I half-expected Kiyo to ask for an abortion then and there, but he was still biting back his words. It was going to be a for later conversation, I knew.\n Ruth cleaned me up and then retreated with the doctor. They gestured Kiyo along with them. \"It\u0027s crowded,\" said Dr. Sartori good-naturedly. \"You can meet up in the waiting room to schedule your next appointment.\"\n \"Yes,\" said Kiyo, eyes boring into me. \"We\u0027ll talk out there.\"\n I forced a pained smile, and Jasmine turned anxiously toward me the second the door shut. \"He is pissed,\" she said.\n \"I know. You don\u0027t have to tell me.\"\n I pulled on my clothes, my limbs feeling leaden. \"Oh God. I can\u0027t believe this is happening. Why? Why did I defy the odds? It was a one in three chance. One in three!\" My voice was turning hysterical, as I begged this teen girl for answers. \"All girls. All boys. Either was more likely than this. Why couldn\u0027t it have been one of those? Why couldn\u0027t we have had an easy fix?\"\n Jasmine\u0027s face was solemn. \"But you do. You said if one was a boy, you\u0027d still have an abortion. You said you\u0027d do it.\" There was a challenge in her voice.\n I finished putting on my shoes and looked away from her. The monitor was black, the room silent, but I could still hear the heartbeats in my head. If I had an abortion to ensure the prophecy wasn\u0027t fulfilled, I\u0027d be taking an innocent life. My daughter - that concept was still crazy to me - had no part in this. It wasn\u0027t her fault her brother was destined for blood and destruction. Really, was it even his fault? There was hardly anything to him yet. Just a shadow. And a heartbeat. How could you dictate the future of someone not even born? How could you know what he would turn into? Was anyone\u0027s potential really set in stone?\n And how could I be the one to kill that potential?\n How could I silence that heartbeat?\n Either of them.\n \"Eugenie?\" Jasmine\u0027s voice was puzzled. \"You\u0027re going to do it, right?\"\n I lifted my eyes from my feet. \"I - I don\u0027t know.\"\n \"You have to.\"\n A new voice spoke in the room. My skin tingled, and suddenly, Deanna materialized before us. I jumped. In light of everything else that had been happening in my life, she\u0027d kind of gone off my radar. I\u0027d left her in Enrique\u0027s hands and assumed that everything was settled with her when she hadn\u0027t answered my summoning.\n \"What the hell?\" I demanded. \"What are you doing here?\" So much for her moving on.\n Deanna looked like she always did, wearing that desolate look ghosts so often had.\n \"You have to,\" she repeated, ignoring my questions. Her expression grew bleaker. \"If you don\u0027t get rid of your children, Kiyo will kill you.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/iron-crowned-dark-swan-3/page-23.html","bookId":2040,"book":{"id":2040,"title":"Iron Crowned (Dark Swan #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Dark Swan Series Book 3: Iron Crowned \n An embattled realm mystically entwined with our own, the Otherworld is at the mercy of one woman...Shaman-for-hire Eugenie Markham is the best at banishing entities trespassing in the mortal realm.
