{"id":109413,"no":11,"title":"Page 11","content":"\"Cute,\" I said.\n Kiyo turned to me, giving me the same assessment I\u0027d just given him. \"You okay?\"\n \"A little venom and probably some bruising tomorrow.\"\n He nodded, relieved, and then did a double take. \"You\u0027re bleeding.\"\n \"Am I?\" I asked, almost as surprised as he was.\n He hurried over to me. \"Your shoulder.\"\n \"Oh, shit,\" I said, craning my neck to look back. \"That\u0027s the table injury.\"\n \"Take off your shirt. And don\u0027t even start with some ridiculous modesty spiel,\" he added, seeing me start to protest. I knew he was right and gingerly lifted off the M\u0026ouml;tley Cr��e shirt. He helped me part of the way, saving me from raising my arms too far. Examining the shirt, I saw blood soaked in it.\n \"Bad?\" I asked.\n \"I\u0027ll know once I take the bandages off. Please tell me you have more and that we don\u0027t have to reuse these.\"\n \"I\u0027ve got more. I told you I brought supplies.\"\n Carefully, he peeled off the gash\u0027s cloth coverings and tossed them to the ground. In the firelight and dim glow of sunrise, I could see the fabric was completely red with blood.\n \"You broke some stitches,\" he said wearily. \"I don\u0027t have the tools to fix it.\" I\u0027d once been kind of freaked out that he used his veterinarian skills to patch battle wounds, but now I kind of took it in stride.\n \"Pain aside, is that going to matter?\" I asked.\n \"You\u0027ll bleed more, though I\u0027ll wrap it as much as I can. You\u0027ll risk a scar too if you don\u0027t get it stitched again. Once we finish this craziness up, I can do it for you back in Tucson if you don\u0027t want to explain it to your doctor.\"\n \"My regular one\u0027s kind of used to this,\" I said.\n He snorted. \"I imagine so.\"\n I fetched my pack, and we both sat on the ground. The light was increasing, making it easier for him to work as he tidied up my back. The old bandages were tossed away, and I winced as he swabbed everything with antiseptic wipes.\n \"I thought the danger didn\u0027t start until we were in the crown\u0027s cave,\" I muttered.\n \"As often happens, mistress, you\u0027ve made an incorrect assumption,\" said Volusian. \"The legends say the path to the crown is perilous. We are on the path. Your testing has begun.\"\n \"Fantastic. Ow!\"\n \"I\u0027m saving you from infection,\" chastised Kiyo. That seemed to be the last of the sanitizing, thankfully, and from there he began layering gauze and tape. What he did was far from erotic, but it amazed me how gentle and steady his hands could be after seeing him savagely fight and rip things apart.\n I glanced over at Deanna, who had simply observed the fight. She\u0027d said nothing, but I thought I caught a glimpse of relief on her face. My death would have put a serious hitch in our bargain.\n \"How long until the entrance? When we lose you guys?\" I asked. Annoying or not, Volusian would be missed - especially if these snakes were just the warm-up act.\n \"A few hours,\" said Deanna.\n I frowned, unsure if I should dread it or not. We\u0027d lose our backup but be that much closer to finishing this anti-vacation.\n \"I suppose it\u0027d be too much to hope you\u0027ve brought any painkillers?\" asked Kiyo, still layering me up. I felt like I had a quilt on my back.\n \"Vicodin probably isn\u0027t the best asset for impending battle.\"\n \"I was thinking more like aspirin.\"\n \"Nope.\" But it did remind me I was due for another antibiotic dose. I\u0027d arrogantly thought I didn\u0027t need them but now was glad for my mom\u0027s vigilance. Not that I wanted to admit any of this to Kiyo. The thing about dating a doctor was that he\u0027d always been on me about taking better care of myself. I didn\u0027t want to hear any I-told-you-so\u0027s now. And unsurprisingly, there was more advice to come.\n He finished the last of the tape and helped me put on the clean shirt I\u0027d packed. \"Eugenie, wrapping this is a nuisance, but any gentry healer could have fixed this up in their sleep. Dorian\u0027s got great healers. Why didn\u0027t he have one of them take care of this? He should know better.\"\n I shifted around so I faced him. \"How on earth did this suddenly become Dorian\u0027s fault? Why is he responsible for everything evil? Of course he offered to get a healer. I refused because I figured other people needed it more.\" I\u0027d also totally forgotten to ask Shaya.\n Kiyo\u0027s expression relaxed and actually grew apologetic. He looked away. \"Of course you did. I\u0027m sorry.\"\n \"Sorry for accusing Dorian or for forgetting I\u0027d be foolishly altruistic?\"\n Kiyo turned back, a small smile on his lips. \"What do you think? There\u0027s very little I feel apologetic for when it comes to Dorian, especially when I\u0027m still convinced he wants to father Storm King\u0027s heir.\"\n I smiled back. \"I\u0027m sure he does too. But it\u0027s a moot point. I\u0027ve still got birth control pills. I still don\u0027t want any kids. My life\u0027s stressful enough.\" Belatedly, I recalled his adoration of Luisa. \"No offense.\"\n \"None taken,\" he said, still smiling. \"Really ... I should be better about trusting you. I just keep thinking ...\" The smile dimmed a little.\n \"Thinking what?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know. That one day this will all get to you. And I don\u0027t mean about Storm King. I mean just ... everything. You\u0027ll totally give yourself over to this world. I\u0027ll lose the Eugenie I know.\"\n I grabbed his hand without thinking and squeezed it. \"Hey, stop that. You said it yourself: trust me. I\u0027m the same Eugenie. Still split between identities ... but nothing can change that.\"\n \"I know.\" He continued holding my hand. The touch of his fingers, which had been so objectively medical minutes ago, now took on another feel ... something warmer. Something that made my body feel strange, as those dark eyes stayed fixed on me. I found myself falling into them like I used to, into those sexy, smoky depths....\n I abruptly stood up, breaking that dangerous touch. \"Well,\" I said awkwardly, \"seeing as it\u0027s already light out and we\u0027re up, we might as well get going. Breakfast in the saddle?\"\n Kiyo rose too, looking troubled. \"Sure. The sooner we\u0027re moving, the sooner we\u0027re past any snake threats.\"\n As we packed up and got back on the horses, I wondered if we were riding toward something much worse than snakes. Don\u0027t get me wrong: they\u0027d been bad. But I fought supernatural creatures all the time. There\u0027d been so much hype about the crown. Was it simply going to involve a monster buffet?\n I kept those thoughts to myself as we traveled, having plenty of other things to preoccupy me. My meager breakfast. Kiyo\u0027s presence. The pain in my back. The meaning behind the scattered holes in the terrain.\n On the road went, just as it would through any part of the Otherworld. I wondered how far it went. To infinity? Or would a traveler simply fall off the edge, like on those maps made back when people believed the world was flat?\n \"This is it.\"\n Deanna\u0027s voice, though soft, seemed harsh in the emptiness around us. We came to a halt, and I glanced around, searching for what she\u0027d found. At last, I spotted a small, dark opening tucked in one of the iron mountains.\n \"That\u0027s it? It seems so ... small.\"\n \"Out here it does,\" said Kiyo. \"We don\u0027t know what\u0027s inside ... except that it\u0027s going to completely enclose us in iron. Remember - that\u0027d kill most gentry. It\u0027s a test you\u0027re lucky enough to skip. Hopefully.\"\n \"True,\" I murmured. I still felt no ostensible effects from this land, but what would happen inside the mountain?\n \"I can\u0027t go inside,\" said Deanna. \"I\u0027ll just wait here for you to come out.\"\n \"I too shall wait,\" said Volusian, \"in the hopes that you meet your death and that it is your spirit that emerges, so that I may torment it for all eternity.\"\n I pushed away the desire to order him away. Even if he couldn\u0027t follow us, I\u0027d feel better having him right here for defense when we came out. And we would come out, I decided fiercely. There was no if here.\n I left my bag and gun outside, seeing as I had no ammunition left. Fucking snakes. Surveying the rest of my arsenal, I left the iron athame in my belt, putting the silver athame in my right hand and the wand in my left. I glanced at Kiyo.\n \"Ready?\"\n He nodded. \"I\u0027ll go first.\"\n It was a very manly thing to do. I let him lead and faintly heard Deanna wishing us luck. The cave we entered was pitch black and cramped. I could just barely get through without ducking and knew Kiyo had to walk slightly hunched. We followed the twists and turns, scraping against the close, rough walls. We spoke occasionally to check location, and I\u0027d sometimes touch his back as well. The deeper we went, the more I could feel the iron around us. Again, I had no indications of weakness ... just an awareness.\n \"Light,\" said Kiyo suddenly.\n I blinked. He was right. I saw no light source, but something farther ahead was casting light down the tunnel. It started as only faint illumination, just giving me a glimpse of his silhouette. Soon, the light increased ... as did the heat. A roaring sound came to my ears.\n \"I have a bad feeling about this,\" I said.\n We rounded a corner, and my jaw nearly dropped. The path ahead was blocked by fire. To be precise, it was blocked by sheets of very neatly contained fire, giving the impression of giant blades - particularly since they swung from the ceiling. Magically flattened into sheets or not, the flames burned intensely, and the heat radiating through the corridor left no doubt that these bastards would incinerate us.\n \"I think I saw this in a video game,\" I muttered.\n Kiyo\u0027s gaze was fixed unwaveringly on the fire blades. There were five of them. His face was blank, but the concentration in his eyes told me what he was doing. He was timing them, studying their patterns.\n \"They\u0027re staggered in a way that would let us get through,\" he said. \"We just have to watch the timing.\"\n \"You can get through. I don\u0027t know about me.\" I wasn\u0027t being defeatist; I was just stating the truth. Kiyo possessed reflexes I didn\u0027t have. I could sit here for hours and probably not learn their patterns like he could.\n He frowned. \"Maybe I can just hold your hand. Or put you on my back.\"\n \"What? No. That\u0027s ridiculous. It\u0027d affect your speed - throw you off.\" I studied the flames, hypnotized by the swinging patterns. There were spaces between each sheet. \"Maybe I can wing it, take them one at a time.\"\n \"Now that\u0027s a ridiculous idea.\" Frustration lined his brow.\n \"And to think, I would have given anything for heat last night. We should have camped in here....\" My joke trailed off as an idea came to me. \"I\u0027ll just walk through.\"\n The look he gave me required no words to convey his opinion.\n \"Seriously,\" I said. I put my weapons away and drew on the magic within me. The iron wasn\u0027t affecting me. I toyed with the elements of air and water, testing and weaving them like a scarf. Kiyo could feel the shift in temperature near us.\n \"What are you thinking?\"\n \"I can protect myself,\" I said. \"The cave\u0027s damp enough - aside from here - for me to draw water. I\u0027ll make a shield for me and use air to blow out against the fire.\"\n \"The air could feed the flames.\"\n \"Not if I do it right.\"\n Our eyes met. He didn\u0027t like this idea, not at all. \"This\u0027ll work,\" I told him. \"I know for a fact it will.\"\n \"For a fact, huh? I still think I should carry you.\"\n \"And I still think that\u0027s idiotic. You\u0027ve gotta trust me, Kiyo. I can do this. I can feel it.\"\n He didn\u0027t answer immediately, but I knew I had him. \"If I watch you get burned alive, I\u0027m not going to be happy.\"\n \"Volusian\u0027ll be happy,\" I said. \"At least someone comes out on top.\"\n \"Eugenie!\"\n \"Sorry.\" I gave Kiyo what I hoped was a reassuring smile. \"This\u0027ll work. You go first.\"\n He hesitated a few moments more and then transformed into a fox. For fighting, he often chose a powerful, larger than life one. Now, he was small and quick like any ordinary red fox. He turned toward the flames, the human part - and probably animal too - again gauging timing. Then - he sprang forward.\n I\u0027d piled assurances on him, but it was my own breath that caught while watching him. He ran without stopping, stride smooth and consistent as he flawlessly ran through empty space caused by the flames\u0027 swinging to the opposite side of the cave. In seconds, he reached the end, on the other side of the fifth sheet. I exhaled. He transformed back to Kiyo and peered at me through the sporadic gaps, worry all over him.\n I gave him another confident smile, hoping my earlier argument would hold true. I stared at the flames, not to time them but simply to muster my own courage. Magic welled up within me as I pulled moisture around my body, creating a spinning, almost cyclone-like cocoon - that instantly soaked me. That was the least of my worries. Then, I called on the air, drawing it to me and forcing it to blast away from my body.\n As I stepped forward, my mind suddenly ran through a hundred other scenarios. Maybe I could have just sucked out the oxygen here and killed the fire. Of course, that\u0027d likely render me unconscious. And would ordinary physics even work against magic fire? That question came to me too late, along with the realization that magic fire might similarly be immune to air and water.\n Woosh!\n I lacked Kiyo\u0027s timing. The first fiery sheet flew at me - and went around me. My fan-effect blew it away and the scalding heat that would have still reached me was mitigated by the water. I picked up my pace, walking through the second one in a similar way. Lucky timing made me miss the third altogether. The fourth nailed me - or would have - and then I just barely sidestepped the fifth.\n I reached Kiyo\u0027s side and dropped the magic. \"Three out of five ain\u0027t bad,\" I said cheerfully. To my surprise he hugged me, in spite of my dripping clothes and hair.\n \"Jesus Christ that was scary, Eug. When I saw you walk through that first wall ...\"\n \"... you thought it was pretty cool?\"\n He pulled back and shook his head, watching as I wrung water from my shirt. \"You sure are making an awful lot of jokes about some pretty serious stuff.\"\n \"Hey, you\u0027re the one who made the Dune reference.\" I sighed and let my hands fall to my sides. \"Besides, if I wasn\u0027t making jokes, I\u0027d probably come to my senses and be running straight back to the Thorn Land.\" I drew air to me, taking along some of the heat, to sort of blow-dry me off. I stopped when I was semi-dry, not wanting to use up the magic.\n \"I understand,\" he said. He gently touched my arm, smiled weakly, and then tilted his head toward the darkness ahead. \"Ready for more?\"\n I nodded, following him once again. We walked farther and farther from the flames, losing the light as we did. A strange flashback came to me, a trip to the Underworld where I\u0027d walked through similar caves and faced tests to bring back Kiyo\u0027s soul. How could I have nearly forgotten about that? I\u0027d loved him so much, I\u0027d faced Death herself. How did love like that change?\n More tunnel crawling followed, and I wondered if perhaps this was a test for claustrophobic gentry. Gradually, though, the tunnel began to expand and expand until it suddenly dead-ended into a large cavernous room. Much like the tunnel, everything here was simply rough rock with occasional glimpses of iron. A few torches lit the chamber, revealing its centerpiece: an elegant marble pedestal with an iron crown sitting on it.\n \"Seriously?\" I said.\n Kiyo and I hovered near the room\u0027s opening, wary of entering. Yet, as I stared at the crown, it wasn\u0027t any potential trap that sent a chill down my spine. Another test in my trip to the Underworld replayed in my mind: I\u0027d been forced to wear my father\u0027s crown, despite my protests. That crown had been platinum, but it and the one before me both had a similar silvery sheen. Both were adorned with purple jewels. Both had a harsh, martial feel to them. The one in the vision had been a little more delicate, though, with a bit more artistic flair. Designer planning had also clearly gone into this one, with its circle of jeweled spikes alternating in size, but my feel was that it was meant to be impressive, not pretty.\n \"It\u0027s an illusion,\" I said to Kiyo. \"We can\u0027t have reached it already. We\u0027ve hardly done anything.\"\n He didn\u0027t take his eyes off the crown as he spoke. \"Snakes and walking through fire are nothing?\"\n \"Well, no. But I expected more, considering all the hype.\"\n \"The iron,\" Kiyo reminded me. \"You used magic to get through the fire. Most gentry would too - but imagine what it would be like for them in all this iron. If they even got this far. You\u0027re ... not cheating, exactly, but you\u0027re bypassing a lot of the challenges here.\"\n \"If it\u0027s meant to be for gentry, then maybe the crown is too. Maybe I\u0027m too human and won\u0027t be able to claim it.\" Man, that would suck.\n \"One way to find out.\"\n I stared at the crown, noticing how little light reflected off it. Was this it? Did I really just go up and claim it? Time to find out. I took a few steps forward ... and the room abruptly became cold. A dark feeling, a feeling of power and pure evil filled the small space. What does evil feel like? You just know. I hastily returned to Kiyo\u0027s side, but it was too late.\n A male figure materialized before us, clad in beautiful purple velvet robes, embroidered and tailored in a way Dorian might have envied. This guy\u0027s hair was nearly as beautiful, a pale white blond that shone in the torchlight and grazed his shoulders. Yes, definitely an impressively attired figure. The only thing that really detracted from it all was that he was a skeleton.\n \"Oh, fuck,\" I said.\n \"What is it?\" asked Kiyo, moving close to me.\n \"A lich. Like a ... I don\u0027t know. An undead necromancer or magic user.\" My mind was frantically spinning. Liches used magic before their deaths to purposely keep themselves from the Underworld. It made them very hard to banish, according to Roland. I\u0027d only ever heard of them in stories.\n \"Like a zombie?\"\n \"No. Smarter. And they can also do - duck!\"\n Kiyo, always a hair faster than me, had already dropped down and taken me with him as the lich hurled a ball of blue fire at us. It hit the wall above us, dispersing and blasting us with heat but otherwise doing no harm. More of that fire was already forming in its skeletal hand, and I knew it would aim low.\n Kiyo transformed to his largest fox form and leapt at the lich, attacking the best way he knew how. His jaws started to close around the lich\u0027s robe-encased leg, but a small gesture from the lich sent Kiyo flying. He hit a wall, shook it off, and growled, pacing and planning what to do next in light of this new development.\n During their split-second encounter, I had just enough time to send my senses out through the wand. I touched the Underworld and attempted to form a connection. The butterfly on my arm burned like the snake\u0027s venom, but I couldn\u0027t open the way. It was like beating on a heavy locked door. More effort might have helped me break through, but I had no chance to try before another fireball came toward me. I dodged and rolled away. Seeing the lich deflect Kiyo again made me think an athame attack wasn\u0027t going to be much help either.\n The lich seemed to recognize my problems and laughed, a low, guttural sound that echoed unnaturally in the chamber. \"You will not wear the Iron Crown. You do not possess the power to wear the Iron Crown.\"\n I was ready to evade another fireball, but a flick of the lich\u0027s hand threw me back against the wall. I didn\u0027t even have time to process the agony that caused to my wounds because the unseen force that pinned me there hurt too much. It was like a million invisible needles were piercing my skin, going straight through me, and lodging in the stone to hold me in place. I screamed at the pain, and Kiyo instantly raced toward the lich again. The larger the fox form, the more animal he was, and I had a feeling this was just a gut reaction at seeing me attacked.\n The lich threw him off again with that invisible force - only harder this time. Kiyo slammed against the wall, slumping down to the cave\u0027s floor. Weakly, he tried to stand up on all four legs but was too disoriented and injured. The lich turned back to me, and I saw death in his eyes. Had I really joked about this being easy? The only one this had been easy for was the lich. He\u0027d taken us out with just a few spells, and now I would die. This was why those who wore the Iron Crown were feared. If you could survive this, you could survive anything.\n \"You will not wear the Iron Crown,\" he repeated, lifting his hands for the final spell. \"You are not worthy.\"\n I summoned my magic, despite the pain. A gale force wind blasted into him, making him stagger back. So. He wasn\u0027t totally impervious to physical force. Calling the magic was difficult, but when Dorian had first trained me, we\u0027d practiced casting spells in a number of uncomfortable positions. I increased the force of the wind, pushing the lich back a couple more steps. The Iron Crown didn\u0027t budge, but the wind had pinned Kiyo up against the wall, almost making him go flat. I nearly hesitated, fearing I\u0027d hurt him. He was still alive from the last hit. Surely he could handle this.\n And that added force was a good call. It distracted the lich so that when I mentally pushed back against his spell, he couldn\u0027t hold it. The invisible pins vanished, and I slid to the floor, landing shakily but upright. I still hurt and already felt worn out but held strong to my magic. It kept the lich away, but it also didn\u0027t knock him into the walls the way he could us. His skull-face wore a perpetual grin, making this all that much more annoying.\n \"You don\u0027t have the power,\" he said, seeing I couldn\u0027t do much more with the wind. \"You are not worthy of the crown.\"\n White light began glowing between his hands. No fireballs this time. It was lightning. It flew from his hands with incredible speed - say, like, the speed of light - but I evaded it, with almost no thought. Lightning was in my skill set. My body was attuned to it, able to anticipate and avoid it even with its speed.\n Nonetheless, the lightning blasted away half of the cave wall and the thunder that accompanied the bolt nearly left me deaf. Rocks and debris from the shattered stone were swept up in my windstorm, flying around the room like shrapnel. A few of them hit me. One cut my arm. In spite of it all, I laughed, sounding slightly crazy even to myself.\n \"You\u0027re going to fight me with lightning?\" I yelled above the raging wind, which I had managed to kick up a notch after all. \"Do you know who I am?\"\n \"I know you will never have the crown,\" the lich replied, summoning more lightning.\n His words dug into me, and not just because my life was on the line here. It was the meaning behind them. You are not worthy. A dismissal of me. Of my power. He really didn\u0027t know who he was dealing with, though. He had no idea of the power I could wield, even in this iron dungeon. No one would say it directly, but I was beginning to suspect I was the most powerful magic user since my father. This bastard lich was about to find that out. He\u0027d see my power. I\u0027d destroy him and take his fucking crown.\n \"You call that lightning?\" I yelled, after dodging the next bolt. My magical senses touched the molecules in the room, the positive and negative charges. The scent of ozone was everywhere. \"This is lightning.\"\n I didn\u0027t need my hands. I could create lightning from the air. It blasted into the lich and should have disintegrated him. He stayed intact, unfortunately, but the way he wobbled and didn\u0027t instantly go for another bolt told me I\u0027d made progress.\n The magic burned within me, filling every ounce of my being as I held onto the surrounding air. The wind still blew, the ions stayed readied. In the center of it all was the crown, the crown I was going to walk out of here with. I would stop this war and show Katrice and everyone else not to screw with me.\n But first, I needed to finish this. I considered continually blasting the lich with bolts, but another idea came to mind. It would bring all of this to an end quickly. Scientists have long debated the existence of ball lightning, but I knew it was real. I\u0027d never really used it in a serious way but had experimented. Some of the principles of its formation were like those of \"regular\" lightning, but a few quirks were what made it unique - and so hard to study.\n I knew how to summon it. I knew what it could do in here. Whereas the magically created bolts the lich and I had wielded had been shaped and controlled, ball lightning was huge and radiating. It would fill this cave, incinerating the lich. I wouldn\u0027t be surprised if it melted the walls. And the crown? The crown would survive - as would I, being the magic\u0027s mistress.\n The power blasted out of me, lightning forming an orb in the cave that exploded outward, blinding even my eyes. The walls shook, heat washed over me, and a roaring filled my ears. I heard the lich scream, a horrible, raspy sound. I didn\u0027t let go of the spell until his cry faded to silence. The ball lightning disappeared instantly, almost startlingly so. My own control of such power surprised me a little.\n My ears rang in the silence. The crown stood unharmed, as expected. The pile of bones I\u0027d expected was not there, however. Instead, a small, wizened man stood before me, dressed in the same purple robes. I reached out and readied my magic for this new threat. He didn\u0027t move, though. To my astonishment, he smiled and gave me a small bow.\n \"Congratulations,\" he said. He gestured to the crown. \"You are worthy - if you can wear it, of course. And something tells me you can, if you\u0027ve survived this much iron.\"\n I glanced back and forth between him and the crown, unbelieving. \"I did it.... I won through. Won the crown. I defeated the lich ... er, you ... or whatever.\"\n \"Certainly the lich was part of the test. It takes great magic to defeat one. But the test was about more than your power,\" said the old man slyly. \"It was about your determination. Your will. Your ruthlessness to get to the crown, no matter the cost.\"\n He stepped aside, waving his hand over at the cave\u0027s side. I gasped. Kiyo - in human form - lay against the wall. His dark eyes were open, and I saw no obvious injuries. He was simply watching the interaction. I flew to his side, kneeling down.\n \"Oh my God. Are you okay?\" I asked, helping him sit up. His breathing was even, though he looked a little addled. \"Please ... talk to me. Kiyo. Are you okay?\"\n \"Yeah, yeah ...\" He lightly touched his forehead and winced. \"Hell of a headache.\"\n I could scarcely breathe. I felt numb all over. \"You shouldn\u0027t be alive,\" I whispered. \"You should have died.\"\n That ball lightning had eradiated the room. That had been my plan, after all. Destroy everything except me and the crown - and everything would have included Kiyo. In the moment, I had forgotten. I had forgotten all about him. I\u0027d been too fixated on the crown, on proving to the lich who the real badass around here was. Kiyo hadn\u0027t mattered in that moment, and it had nothing to do with our rocky relationship. I had the horrible, terrifying feeling that it wouldn\u0027t have mattered who was in the room.\n \"Oh, God,\" I said again, pulling his head against my chest. Tears stung my eyes. \"Oh God oh God. I\u0027m so sorry. I\u0027m so, so sorry. I don\u0027t know what ... I don\u0027t know what I was thinking....\" A nasty voice spoke inside my head. Didn\u0027t you?\n \"Hey, Eug, calm down,\" said Kiyo, patting the back of my head. \"I\u0027m okay, don\u0027t worry. You did it. You defeated it.\"\n He didn\u0027t get it. He didn\u0027t get what I\u0027d done - or nearly done. Clearly, whatever crazy, powerful magic was involved here had protected him for the sake of the test. But if it hadn\u0027t ...\n \"Seriously,\" said Kiyo, still not understanding my distress. \"I\u0027m fine. Just got tossed around too much. Now go get the crown. He said it\u0027s yours.\" I pulled away and looked into Kiyo\u0027s eyes, eyes full of fondness and pride. I didn\u0027t deserve that look, but we needed the crown, and we needed to get out of here.\n I rose unsteadily and walked over to the pedestal. The crown sat there ominously, and I glanced at the old man. He nodded encouragingly. If you can wear it. I supposed there was one more test, one I might fail. When my fingers touched the crown, I felt nothing, only cold metal. I lifted it gingerly, almost afraid of what I did. It was heavy - far heavier than my crown of state or fashionable ones. Yet, it fit my head perfectly, which was weird. When I\u0027d first seen it, I\u0027d been overwhelmed by its size. I\u0027d been certain it would fall right off.\n The old man beamed and bowed again. \"And now it is yours. Its powers are yours. You can make armies tremble. You can rip away lands and subdue them. The world can be yours.\"\n Hoping I\u0027d proven myself, I removed the crown. \"I just hope I can end a war.\"\n Kiyo rose shakily to his feet. He no longer smiled. \"What do you mean she can rip away lands?\"\n The old man spread his hands out wide. \"That is the crown\u0027s power.\"\n \"The crown has no power,\" I said, frowning. \"It\u0027s a prize, a status symbol for enduring all this.\"\n \"A prize?\" The old man\u0027s eyebrows rose, and he gave a great belly laugh. \"Do you believe all of that was just for a prize? For some bauble?\"\n Kiyo and I exchanged uneasy looks. \"Then what does it do?\" I asked.\n \"The Iron Crown allows you to break the bond between a monarch and his or her kingdom, thus freeing it. If you have the strength, you can then claim it.\" The old man shrugged. \"Why, with enough power, you could control half the kingdoms in this world.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/iron-crowned-dark-swan-3/page-11.html","bookId":2040,"book":{"id":2040,"title":"Iron Crowned (Dark Swan #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Dark Swan Series Book 3: Iron Crowned \n An embattled realm mystically entwined with our own, the Otherworld is at the mercy of one woman...Shaman-for-hire Eugenie Markham is the best at banishing entities trespassing in the mortal realm.
