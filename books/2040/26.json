{"id":109428,"no":26,"title":"Page 26","content":"\"So, let me make sure I\u0027m following this correctly.\" I sighed and shifted on the bed, knowing Dorian was repeating this conversation mostly because he liked seeing my discomfort. \"Your \u0027technology\u0027 can tell you you\u0027re having a boy and a girl, when they\u0027re due, and allow you to hear their heartbeats,\" he continued. \"But some medicine inexplicably totally counteracted the other one you take to prevent pregnancy.\" \"Took,\" I muttered. \"Seeing as it\u0027s kind of pointless now.\" Dorian leaned back in a plush armchair, face expressing overly dramatic pondering. After fainting, I\u0027d been given a guest room befitting my status, a good sign since \"hospitality\" simply meant protection and in no way related to one\u0027s accommodations. It wasn\u0027t quite as nice as Dorian\u0027s room, of course, but the mattress was thick and fluffy, and the green velvet canopy coordinated with the heavy brocaded bedding. As sick as I\u0027d felt, I honestly would have been content to curl up on the floor somewhere. I\u0027d been awake for about an hour now, alone in the vast room save for Dorian. \"What a fascinatingly bizarre turn of events,\" he mused, stroking his chin. \"If you thought the Iron Crown scared people, just wait until this news spreads. Which, of course, it already has.\" I draped a hand over my forehead. \"Isn\u0027t it bad enough that I\u0027m carrying a world-conquering prophecy child? Why all the political fallout?\" \"Because you\u0027re carrying a world-conquering prophecy child,\" he responded. \"It\u0027s the type of thing people tend to have strong feelings about.\" \"I thought almost everyone wanted to conquer the human world.\" \"Most,\" he agreed. \"But not all. Especially those who - after observing your record thus far - might fear you\u0027ll conquer this world first.\" I rolled over to my side, giving me a better view of him. Since the earlier spectacle, Dorian had masked whatever personal feelings he had about my pregnancy, switching into cunning ruler mode. \"But not you,\" I said. \"You\u0027ve always been in favor of this - fulfilling the prophecy.\" \"I\u0027ve never made a secret of that,\" he agreed. \"From the moment we met.\" That was true, at least. He\u0027d sat on that desire while we were involved, but I\u0027d always known it lurked. \"You\u0027ve just kept other secrets instead,\" I blurted out. He didn\u0027t answer me right away, but those green-gold eyes weighed me thoughtfully. \"Yes. Yes, I have. Secrets I now regret.\" That silenced me for several moments. I hadn\u0027t expected any kind of apology. Something in me softened toward him. \"Really?\" \"If I hadn\u0027t deceived you about the Iron Crown,\" he explained, \"we would still be together.\" I could only stare. The piece of me that had never stopped loving him tentatively reared its head. It was hard to believe he was here confessing his feelings, admitting that what we\u0027d had had been more important than his scheming. It gave me a new insight into him, one that astonished ... yet pleased me. \"And if we\u0027d stayed together,\" he continued, \"I would have been the lucky beneficiary of this medicinal slip.\" So much for new insight. I groaned and turned away. \"Of course. Of course that\u0027s the real source of your regret. You don\u0027t get to lead the revolution.\" I heard him get up and sit on the bed beside me. A few seconds later, he actually had the audacity to lie down. I wiggled over to make room. \"It\u0027s more than revolution,\" he said. \"I also told you the first time we met that I\u0027d have a child with you, regardless of any prophecy.\" \"I\u0027m not convinced that the \u0027with me\u0027 part was so relevant.\" Dorian touched my cheek and turned my face toward his. \"Do you really believe that? Do you really believe my feelings for you were so small that your being the mother of my child wouldn\u0027t have meant the world to me?\" I started to snarkily correct him with worlds, but it seemed petty. \"I don\u0027t know what I believe,\" I said honestly. \"I don\u0027t even know if I have the energy or motivation to analyze our relationship when I have this going on.\" I rested my hand on my stomach. Dorian\u0027s eyes followed that motion, utterly captivated. \"Despite your foolish fathering choices, this ...\" He reached toward my stomach as well, then pulled back. \"This is a miracle. This is a prophecy fulfilled. This is life. And really, Kiyo is no longer relevant. He\u0027s given up any claims to these children. They are yours and yours alone now.\" My fingers tightened on my stomach, not painfully, but more in a possessive type of way. My gaze grew unfocused. \"I still can\u0027t believe that. I can\u0027t believe that he\u0027d dismiss his own children so easily. That he\u0027d dismiss me so easily ...\" \"I doubt it was easy. You aren\u0027t that easy to get over.\" A small note of bitterness there. \"But his opposition to the prophecy was too great. Just as my support is great enough to take you in - despite your betrayal - and embark in the madness to come.\" Betrayal? I started to tell him he was the last one who should accuse anyone of that - but held back. \"Will people think you\u0027re crazy to do it?\" \"Hardly,\" he snorted. \"Most will think they\u0027re my children anyway, ironically enough.\" No one except Jasmine had heard my brief paternity exchange with Dorian in the hall. I frowned. \"I think sometimes Kiyo does too.\" \"They can be.\" My first reaction was that this was some sort of joke of his, but all humor had disappeared from his face. \"I don\u0027t think you fully understand genetics.\" \"I understand that parenting is more than just blood,\" he said, still deadly earnest. \"And as I said: he\u0027s relinquished any claims. You are in control, and if even he and others question the children\u0027s parentage, then so much the better. Simply declare me the father. Have it recorded, and by our laws, the children will be mine for all intents and purposes.\" Something about that set off my alarms. \"What do you mean \u0027intents and purposes\u0027?\" He shrugged - a bit too casually. \"Titles. Prestige. Protection. Inheritance - if either is strong enough to hold my kingdom. Which, according to the prophecy, your son should be.\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" I said. There might be some safety benefits to this sort of gentry \"adoption,\" but I had a feeling that Dorian wasn\u0027t telling me all of them - particularly things that benefited him alone. He was still upset with me. He didn\u0027t like Kiyo. There was no reason that I could see for this. \"I have to think about it.\" \"Think fast,\" Dorian said. \"Things will be in motion soon, particularly once we get you back to your own lands.\" \"Why?\" I asked. \"Why would you want to claim someone else\u0027s children? I mean, I get your wanting to see the prophecy come true, but you don\u0027t have to take that extra step.\" \"Maybe someone else\u0027s children are better than no children at all,\" he said. It was another odd statement from him, a surprising one. Both philosophical and touching. Yet, I still believed there was a deception here. This wasn\u0027t out of love for me. Not anymore. His hand moved toward my stomach again and he didn\u0027t pull it away this time, though he made sure to keep away from my hand. \"Let me ask you a question,\" he said when I made no response. \"Why did you choose to keep these children? Do you fear the unholy procedure your people use to end life? Were you unable to live with your daughter\u0027s blood on your hands?\" My mind rewound back to that day at the doctor\u0027s. That day? Hell. It had only been earlier today. So much had happened since then that weeks might have gone by. My horrible ordeal with Kiyo had blurred the memories, but now, the ultrasound came back to me, the sights and sounds as real and vivid as though I were experiencing them all over again. \"I heard their heartbeats,\" I said at last. \"And I saw them.\" Well, kind of. Those blurs still didn\u0027t look like much to me, but the point was irrelevant. \"And when I did ...\" I groped to explain my feelings. \"I just ... I just wanted them. Both of them. None of the rest mattered.\" A slow, strange smile spread across Dorian\u0027s face. \"That,\" he declared, \"is the most gentry thing I\u0027ve ever heard you say.\" Normally, I would have mocked him for using \"gentry\" instead of \"shining ones.\" It was a slip he sometimes made around me. His words\u0027 content, however, was of more importance. \"That\u0027s ridiculous.\" \"Not so. Humans overthink things. They throw away life heedlessly. Honestly, after all this time, I was beginning to think you were more human than shining one.\" \"I hate to tell you, but I am,\" I said. Dorian made himself more comfortable, and the hand on my stomach moved so that his arm lay over me, almost - but not quite - an embrace. It was possessive, like I was a prize that had fallen into his lap. \"Are you, my dear? You\u0027re expressing philosophies very like my own. You\u0027re carrying a child that will allegedly conquer the human world - a world you can\u0027t go back to for a while, seeing as it would give the kitsune an edge. You\u0027re safer here in this world where, I\u0027d like to add, you rule not one but two kingdoms. That,\" he declared triumphantly, \"makes you, by my reckoning, more like a gentry than a human.\" I looked away, not meeting his eyes - because I had a crazy feeling he was right.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/iron-crowned-dark-swan-3/page-26.html","bookId":2040,"book":{"id":2040,"title":"Iron Crowned (Dark Swan #3)","description":"Storyline: Dark Swan Series Book 3: Iron Crowned An embattled realm mystically entwined with our own, the Otherworld is at the mercy of one woman...Shaman-for-hire Eugenie Markham is the best at banishing entities trespassing in the mortal realm.
