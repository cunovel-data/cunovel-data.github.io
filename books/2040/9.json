{"id":109411,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"I propped myself up so that I could look Dorian in the face. Even in dim lighting, I could see he was serious.\\n\\n \"Who, Kiyo?\" I asked in astonishment.\\n\\n \"No, the other annoying kitsune in your life.\"\\n\\n \"Why would you ... why would you suggest something like that?\"\\n\\n \"Excellent question,\" he murmured. His brow furrowed in thought, then relaxed into resignation. \"Because his human blood would protect him and - my personal opinions of him aside - he is a good asset in a fight. Most importantly, he would have no interest in the crown. Nor would it be of any use to him.\"\\n\\n Every one of those things was true. But there was one obvious problem. \"Kiyo wouldn\u0027t help me. Not anymore. Jasmine would be more willing - if only for a chance to escape.\" The argument that Kiyo and I had had in the mountains was still fresh in my head.\\n\\n This brought a smile to Dorian\u0027s lips, and he trailed his fingertips down my arm. \"You doubt your own charms. The kitsune will help you, if you ask him nicely. He\u0027s not over you as much as you think. And he too would jump at the chance at some foolhardy way to end this war.\"\\n\\n \"Foolhardy ... You\u0027ve gone back and forth on the usefulness of the crown yourself. And now you\u0027re willing to - \" I almost said \"allow\" but recalled my earlier words. Dorian didn\u0027t dictate my life. \" - accept me going off with my ex-boyfriend?\"\\n\\n \"This is an acceptable solution. Still dangerous ... but I believe you two could manage it. And I trust you,\" Dorian said simply. \"As you trust me.\"\\n\\n I stared down into his eyes, dark in the flickering torchlight, though the striking shape of his face and fair skin glowed like a masterpiece in marble. \"I do trust you.\"\\n\\n He smiled again. \"Good. We\u0027ll make plans in the morning. But for now ...\" The smile gave way to a yawn. \"I need sleep. This has been a long day.\"\\n\\n It was true. He\u0027d been part of an epic battle and then made love - or whatever you wanted to classify that kinky shit as - like a pro. My day had been pretty busy too, to say the least. I put my head down, wrapping back against him, and soon slept in spite of the shocking suggestion he\u0027d just made.\\n\\n When we woke, however, the crown became our immediate breakfast topic. We\u0027d opted for private dining at a small table in the sitting room adjacent to his bedroom. After hearing about my traipsing about in his too-long robe, he\u0027d had my own made for these slumber parties: white velvet with gold embroidery. It was a bit more elaborate than I would have preferred but felt nice against my bare skin. The wounds certainly appreciated loose clothing too.\\n\\n \"Invite him to your castle,\" said Dorian. Fully rested, he\u0027d shifted completely into cunning mode, barely touching the elaborate spread of pastries and meats his servants had set before us. \"The gods know he won\u0027t come here.\"\\n\\n \"Or Tucson,\" I suggested after swallowing a gentry version of a cinnamon roll. Maybe I could get Tim the recipe. \"He\u0027d probably come to my house there.\"\\n\\n Dorian considered. \"No. Get him to this world, to your domain, so that you can leave as soon as possible. Above all, you must not - under any circumstances - allow him to go back to Maiwenn and consult her on this.\"\\n\\n I swallowed another bite and smiled. \"You think she\u0027d be jealous?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s the least of our reasons.\" He ticked them off on his fingers. \"Remember - she fears you. Us. She wouldn\u0027t see this as an end to the war. She\u0027d see it as you scrambling for power. And, who knows? The kitsune might have no use for the crown himself, but she could coax him into bringing it to her.\"\\n\\n \"She\u0027s not vying for power, last I knew. Besides - it\u0027s winning the crown that\u0027s the big deal, right? If it was just given to her, no one would respect her for it. If it can even be given ... I thought it returns home when it\u0027s away from its victor.\"\\n\\n Dorian didn\u0027t respond right away. \"True. But then that would still keep the crown from you. And we mustn\u0027t forget she might simply talk him out of it because of simple concern for his life.\" Dorian\u0027s tone implied this was a petty concern. \"No, don\u0027t give him a chance to talk to her. Invite him to you and ask - beg, if need be - for his help. Stress whatever urgent reason will work. A need to end the war. Make up some ultimatum from the ghost.\"\\n\\n I set the roll down and tapped my water glass absentmindedly. This was all starting to make me feel strange. \"There\u0027s a lot of conniving here.\"\\n\\n \"There always is in politics. In war. In love, even. But this can help us - more than you can imagine. We must put our faith in the old adage that the ends justify the means.\"\\n\\n I sighed. \"Okay, then. I\u0027ll do it. When?\"\\n\\n \"As soon as possible. Katrice is regrouping. We can take advantage of that.\" That smooth, calculating air faded. \"Though I hate to lose you.\"\\n\\n \"Hey.\" I reached across the table and laid my hand over his. \"Don\u0027t think of it as \u0027losing\u0027 me. It\u0027s just like I\u0027m going to Tucson for a few days.\"\\n\\n He grimaced. \"Except your petty human job doesn\u0027t carry such risks. Fetches aside. I do wish you\u0027d let my healers take care of those wounds before you go.\"\\n\\n The stitched-up cut itched, though the rest weren\u0027t bothering me. I tested the range of motion on my left arm. It was stiff but moved. \"Let your healers keep working here. Maybe I\u0027ll have Shaya fix it up.\" She didn\u0027t possess the skill of a bona fide healer but could do some quick patches.\\n\\n Dorian didn\u0027t like that but let the matter go. We finished breakfast, rehashing what little he knew about the path to the Iron Crown. I shed my robe for my normal clothes, after first having one of his servants clean and re-bandage my back. My mother would be proud, seeing me follow doctor\u0027s orders.\\n\\n We didn\u0027t know where Kiyo was exactly, here or the human world, but Dorian sent a messenger to Maiwenn\u0027s court, inviting him to mine. No one from our lands would be welcomed with open arms in her territory, but she\u0027d allow a messenger through and hopefully let us know if he wasn\u0027t currently in the Otherworld. I also sent Volusian to Tim and Lara, warning I\u0027d be gone for a while and to cancel all my appointments. Lara wouldn\u0027t like that, but I had a feeling it would be the least of her worries when faced with Volusian for the first time.\\n\\n When the time for me to leave came, Dorian couldn\u0027t hide his conflicted feelings. The part of him always striving for advantage and control wanted that crown. The part of him that loved me worried about what I was walking into.\\n\\n \"It\u0027ll be okay,\" I said, wrapping my arms around him. \"I\u0027m Storm King\u0027s daughter, remember? This\u0027ll be cake. And hey, if that ghost\u0027s lying, I\u0027ll be back tonight.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know if I\u0027d prefer that or not,\" he mused. He rested his hand behind my neck and gave me a long, lingering kiss. \"Be careful, Eugenie. Fight hard, but be careful. And take this.\" From a hidden pocket in his cloak, he produced something glittering and handed it to me.\\n\\n I held it up. It was a ring, hanging on a fine chain. Both were made of gold. A diamond flanked by sapphires sat prominently on the ring, which was fashioned to look like a circle of leaves.\\n\\n \"Is this magic?\" I asked.\\n\\n He shook his head. \"Just something to remember me by. Just something to think about.\"\\n\\n I eyed him carefully. Marriage happened among the gentry, though not as often as among humans. Considering our divorce rate, maybe that was smart. They didn\u0027t give engagement rings like humans did, but he\u0027d know my world\u0027s custom. This ring suddenly made me uneasy.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a thing of beauty,\" he said, seeing my reaction. \"For someone beautiful. I knew you wouldn\u0027t wear it on your finger, so keep it on the chain.\"\\n\\n I nodded. Sometimes a gift was just a gift - particularly when someone was afraid his beloved might get killed soon. I kissed him again. \"Thank you.\"\\n\\n I\u0027d come alone via the human world, so he sent an escort back to the Thorn Land with me. No one except Dorian and Masthera knew what I was going to do, but the group could sense something big was about to go down. Tension crackled around us as we traveled. Like so many, these soldiers considered Dorian and me a powerhouse. They could hardly wait to see what would happen next.\\n\\n Kiyo wasn\u0027t waiting for me in the Thorn Land, not that I\u0027d expected results that quickly. No refusal had come from Maiwenn either, which I took as a good sign.\\n\\n \"What are you and my lord planning?\" asked Rurik when he saw me. \"You\u0027ve got that look.\"\\n\\n \"What look is that?\" I asked curiously. He reminded me of Tim.\\n\\n \"The look that says you\u0027re planning something.\"\\n\\n I rolled my eyes. \"Eloquent as ever, Rurik.\"\\n\\n \"Should I assemble fighters?\" he asked, shrugging off my comment. Shaya joined us then, scrolls in her arms.\\n\\n \"No. I do this alone. Well, not exactly. Kiyo\u0027s coming with me. I hope. He should be showing up here today.\" I spoke more confidently than I felt. Despite Dorian\u0027s certainties, I still wasn\u0027t sure whether Kiyo would help or not. Rurik and Shaya exchanged glances. \"Stop that,\" I told them. \"It\u0027s perfectly platonic. Dorian suggested it.\"\\n\\n Rurik looked like he still had a few things to say about it, but Shaya interrupted. \"The Linden King wrote back. He won\u0027t join with us - but he also won\u0027t fight against us.\"\\n\\n \"Not the best news, not the worst. We\u0027ll see if he comes crawling when his power\u0027s in dispute.\" The words came out with more venom than I expected. Rurik seemed to approve. Shaya leafed through more papers.\\n\\n \"Caria, the Laurel Queen, would like to meet with you and discuss the war, however.\"\\n\\n I knew nothing about that land. \"Have we even contacted her?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" said Shaya, giving me a meaningful look. \"But her kingdom borders the Linden Land.\"\\n\\n \"Ah.\" I smiled. My comment to Ranelle that others would be eyeing her king\u0027s land as his power faded was true. In refusing my offer to defend against that, they\u0027d allowed someone else to solicit me for the other side of that future dispute. \"He\u0027ll regret his neutrality later. See if Caria\u0027ll meet with Dorian while I\u0027m gone.\" Dorian would understand the situation perfectly.\\n\\n I figured this was it and started to leave. \"There\u0027s one more thing,\" added Shaya, twisting a black braid in that nervous habit of hers. \"Girard would like to see you.\"\\n\\n Her unease had made me think something bad was coming, but Girard was one of the few people who rarely delivered bad news. If anything, he usually delivered gifts, always coming up with some marvelous new piece of craftsmanship. Some pieces - like Dorian\u0027s sword and Jasmine\u0027s chains - I\u0027d commissioned specifically. Sometimes, however, inspiration struck the artist, and he\u0027d present some intricately worked necklace or diadem that I felt certain was beyond human skill. He could even touch iron in very small amounts.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure he\u0027s made something great, but I\u0027m not in the mood today,\" I told her. \"I want to see Jasmine.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s not here to display work. He wants to introduce you to his sister.\" She looked at me expectantly and seemed surprised by my lack of reaction. \"You\u0027ve never heard of her? Imanuelle de la Colline?\"\\n\\n I shook my head. \"Should I have?\"\\n\\n Shaya shrugged. \"Maybe not. But I think you\u0027ll find her ... interesting. It\u0027ll only take a minute.\"\\n\\n It was true I was in a hurry, but Shaya\u0027s attitude intrigued me. We went to Girard\u0027s workshop, rooms I\u0027d given to him on the castle\u0027s outer edge in case his work ever set something on fire. He was bent over a table, fingers magically working a bundle of metal and jewels.\\n\\n \"Another crown?\" I asked with amusement. They seemed to be his favorite thing to make.\\n\\n Girard looked up, startled, and bowed. \"No, Your Majesty. It\u0027s something Lord Rurik has requested. If you\u0027d like another crown - \"\\n\\n I waved him silent. \"No, no. God knows I have plenty. Hardly seems like Rurik\u0027s style, though.\"\\n\\n Girard didn\u0027t comment. Client confidentiality, I supposed. Turning, he pointed off toward the side of his workshop, and I gaped. A woman stood there, and somehow I hadn\u0027t noticed her upon entering - which seemed impossible. She and her brother shared the same dark skin and black hair, as well as a taste for bright clothing. The dress she wore was a stunning teal silk, cut shorter than most gentry dresses. Something about it gave me the impression she wore it for utility, not sexiness.\\n\\n \"Your Majesty,\" she said, sweeping me a curtsey. Also like Girard, a faintly French-sounding accent laced her words.\\n\\n \"This is my sister, Imanuelle,\" he said. Like Shaya, he seemed to expect me to know who his sister was.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s nice to meet you,\" I told her. When no one said anything, I shifted restlessly, impatient to go. Seeing this, Imanuelle strode forward, her steps graceful and liquid.\\n\\n \"Your Majesty,\" she said. \"I\u0027ve come to offer my services to you, should you like to hire me.\"\\n\\n I glanced at the other faces, seeking more information, but received none. \"What do you do?\" I asked. \"Do you work metal like Girard?\"\\n\\n A mischievous smile crossed Imanuelle\u0027s face. She had caught on that I really didn\u0027t know who she was and appeared to enjoy that. \"No. My talents are of ... a different nature.\"\\n\\n I saw a slight gesture of her hand, and then suddenly, the teal silk dress turned yellow. A moment later, it changed form altogether, turning into a flowing velvet gown. Then, she wasn\u0027t Imanuelle at all. A clone of Shaya stood before me. After letting that sink in, Imanuelle returned to her original form. She bowed, as though having just performed a stage show.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m an illusionist,\" she said. \"I can make people see things that aren\u0027t there. Most importantly, I can make myself look like anything I choose.\"\\n\\n It was one of the cooler gentry powers, but I didn\u0027t entirely see how it\u0027d be useful for me. \"So I can finally be in two places at once?\" I joked.\\n\\n That brought another smile. \"I suppose ... but I\u0027ve honed other skills to accompany these. Ones many monarchs find useful. I ... get rid of problems.\"\\n\\n Apparently guessing my confusion, Shaya sighed and dropped her usual formality. \"You\u0027re better off not dancing around the subject. My queen prefers directness.\" She turned to me. \"Imanuelle is an assassin, Your Majesty.\"\\n\\n Imanuelle\u0027s smile tightened a little. I think she preferred her more flowery description. \"That\u0027s an ugly word for a formidable skill set.\"\\n\\n It took me a moment to catch on. \"So, you\u0027re here to - Wait. You think I\u0027m going to hire you to, what, assassinate Katrice?\"\\n\\n Imanuelle shrugged eloquently, and her brother spoke up for her. \"Some might see that as a quick way to end the war, if I may be so bold.\" Girard had picked up that I didn\u0027t like this idea at all and was understandably nervous. He valued his position with me.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a dirty, sneaky way to end a war!\" I exclaimed. \"It\u0027d make me no better than Katrice and her bastard son.\"\\n\\n \"It would eliminate Katrice directly,\" said Imanuelle. \"Since she is the source of your problems. I could disguise myself as someone in her castle. Quick, easy. No other innocents need be hurt.\"\\n\\n For a heartbeat, her words almost made sense. Then I shook my head emphatically. \"No. I\u0027m not going to stoop to that level.\"\\n\\n Some of Imanuelle\u0027s pleasant demeanor faded. \"There are monarchs who would give half their kingdoms for my services! I\u0027m very selective. I\u0027m doing you a great honor.\"\\n\\n I narrowed my eyes. \"You\u0027re doing me an honor?\"\\n\\n She hesitated, realizing she was addressing one of the most formidable queens in the Otherworld. Again, Girard jumped in to save her.\\n\\n \"Forgive our presumption, Your Majesty. We only wanted to offer it as an option.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s been offered,\" I said bluntly. \"And refused. Thank you for the \u0027honor.\u0027 You\u0027re welcome to visit your brother, of course, but I\u0027d prefer that you stay here no longer than absolutely necessary.\"\\n\\n I turned dramatically away from them, just catching the outrage on Imanuelle\u0027s face, and strode out. Shaya hurried by my side.\\n\\n \"Spoken like a queen,\" she said.\\n\\n \"Do I need to worry about that woman killing me now?\" I asked. \"Is she going to change into you and pull a knife on me?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure you\u0027d respond as efficiently as you do to the other attacks on you,\" said Shaya dryly. \"Her illusions aren\u0027t foolproof to everyone. I\u0027m guessing Volusian could see through them if he were around. But, honestly ... although her pride has been hurt - she does have quite the reputation - I suspect she\u0027ll simply stalk off and leave you be, if only for her brother\u0027s sake.\"\\n\\n \"Well, that\u0027s nice. One less person trying to kill me.\" I raked my hand through my hair. \"Anything else I need to deal with?\"\\n\\n That was a loaded question, of course. Shaya had a few more business matters for me to look over before I could finally see Jasmine. I hadn\u0027t talked to her after the dinner at Dorian\u0027s and felt she\u0027d be a good distraction as I waited to see if Kiyo would come. I found her outside in one of the gardens, sitting in the shade of a mesquite tree as the sun grew higher and the heat increased. Her guards stood stoically nearby, and her fine chains glittered in the light. At my approach, she glanced up from a book. Petulant, power-hungry teen that she might be, she was also an avid reader, using fantasy to escape her mundane existence when she\u0027d still lived among humans. This book was one I\u0027d brought her recently, the first in a trendy series.\\n\\n \"Is it good?\" I asked, sitting down opposite her.\\n\\n \"Not bad,\" she said, playing cool. A moment later, she gave herself away. \"Are there more out in the series?\"\\n\\n \"Three more, I think.\"\\n\\n She said nothing but smiled as she set the book beside her.\\n\\n \"Did you have fun at Dorian\u0027s?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"Yeah. It was nice to be out.\" Her eyes gazed off, not really focusing on anything. \"I think the best part was watching Shaya scare off all the guys hitting on me.\" She turned back to me. \"Is that what it\u0027s like for you all the time?\"\\n\\n \"Not since I got together with Dorian. They\u0027ve slacked off - and Shaya doesn\u0027t scare them away. She abandons me.\"\\n\\n Jasmine smiled again. \"Dorian\u0027s crazy about you. Obsessed.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s kind of an extreme observation.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s true.\" She brushed hair out of her eyes. The sunlight was turning it to gold, making me a little envious; I\u0027d gotten true red from our father, rather than strawberry blond. She could wear pink. \"It\u0027s good,\" she continued. \"His obsession. That bitch Ysabel wants him, you know. And she hates you. So does her mom.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, I kind of figured that out.\"\\n\\n She shrugged. \"Well, then, keep Dorian close.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not worried.\"\\n\\n \"Ysabel\u0027s got kids, and you won\u0027t give him any.\"\\n\\n I was so sick of hearing about me and procreation. \"Lots of gentry women have kids. Are you saying I should worry about all of them, Little Miss Love Guru?\"\\n\\n \"Not all of them look like you. I mean, not exactly like you ... but I think Dorian gets off on redheads. Maybe he figures he\u0027ll have red-haired kids that way. I don\u0027t know. But, whatever. I\u0027m just saying she\u0027s waiting there for you to slip up with Dorian. And he\u0027s already gone for her before. She\u0027s got a bigger chest than you, too.\"\\n\\n \"Hey,\" I said indignantly. \"That\u0027s irrelevant. Besides, he went for her - and she annoyed him. And I\u0027m not going to \u0027slip up.\u0027 He\u0027s not going anywhere.\" I frowned, surprised by my next words, that I\u0027d actually say them to her. \"It\u0027s Kiyo I\u0027ve got to pull in.\"\\n\\n Jasmine\u0027s gray eyes widened in shock. \"Him? He\u0027s no use to you ... unless, oh Jesus. You guys aren\u0027t planning some three-way, are you? I mean, I know you and Dorian get into some - \"\\n\\n \"No!\" I exclaimed. \"It\u0027s nothing like that. I need a favor from Kiyo, that\u0027s all. A big one. A dangerous one. I\u0027m not sure what\u0027ll convince him.\" I smiled weakly, remembering Dorian\u0027s expression when I\u0027d showed up in the tight gentry dress. \"I\u0027d know what to do if it was Dorian.\"\\n\\n Jasmine scoffed and gave me a scathing look. \"How stupid are you? Even I know what to do if you want to suck in Kiyo. Look human.\"\\n\\n \"I am human. Who\u0027s stupid now?\" Good grief. We\u0027d advanced to snippy quarrelling. We were becoming real sisters more and more each day.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re half human. Dorian likes that because he thinks he can knock you up ... but the rest? He wants you to be a queen. One of the shining ones. Kiyo doesn\u0027t. He hates all of that. He doesn\u0027t want you anywhere near it. You hooked up before you were into all the Otherworld stuff. Be like that.\"\\n\\n I stared at her, startled because she had an excellent point. \"Do I look human now?\"\\n\\n Jasmine studied me critically. I had jeans and a T-shirt on, my hair pulled sloppily into a ponytail. My boots were sturdy, made for hiking. Plain. \"Yeah,\" she said, sounding surprised. \"Scruffy and human. He\u0027ll be into that. Except for the ring. It\u0027s from Dorian, right? Put it under your shirt.\"\\n\\n I touched the ring hanging on my chest, having forgotten about it. \"How\u0027d you know it was from him?\"\\n\\n \"Because you wouldn\u0027t get it for yourself, and no one else would either. It\u0027s also got oak leaves.\"\\n\\n I peered down at it. Sure enough. I hadn\u0027t identified the leaves earlier. I followed her advice, concealing it under the shirt. She watched with approval, then seemed to really notice my shirt.\\n\\n \"Who\u0027s M\u0026ouml;tley Cr��e?\"\\n\\n I was saved from lecturing her on classic rock when a servant scurried up to us, telling me Kiyo was here. The ease I\u0027d felt with Jasmine vanished. I stood up, forcing calm, half-wondering if I should take her after all. No. Kiyo was the right choice.\\n\\n \"Good luck,\" Jasmine said, picking up her book. \"And remember: be human.\"\\n\\n I followed the servant away, embarrassed that I was taking advice from an insane fifteen-year-old. Except ... I knew she was right. I made sure my gait was casual, nothing regal. Then, I sent the servant away, deciding it\u0027d be best to come to Kiyo on my own, rather than approaching with an escort, no matter how insignificant.\\n\\n He was waiting inside a parlor, pacing restlessly. I knew how uneasy I made him, and this invitation had no doubt put him on guard. I watched him unnoticed for a moment, admiring that muscled body while knowing it was wrong to do so. Sneaking up on him was impossible, though. He could smell me. My sweat and skin alone would have given me away, let alone the vanilla sunscreen and violet perfume I also wore.\\n\\n \"Eugenie,\" he said, turning around. \"Nice to see you.\" He seemed impassive, but his eyes made me think he really did like seeing me - physically at least.\\n\\n \"Sorry for the abrupt request,\" I said. \"You were probably visiting Luisa, huh?\"\\n\\n The mention of his daughter softened his expression a tiny, tiny bit. \"Yeah, she\u0027s ... she grows every day. It\u0027s amazing.\" He flipped back to alert mode. \"But that\u0027s not why you asked me here.\"\\n\\n \"No.\" I settled into one of the chairs, crossing my legs and hoping I looked casual and unassuming. \"I need your help.\"\\n\\n He continued standing. \"That\u0027s unexpected.\"\\n\\n \"Well, I got an unexpected offer. Do you still want me to get out of this war?\"\\n\\n \"Of course.\" He made a face. \"Oh, Eug. Please tell me you don\u0027t want me to negotiate or something.\"\\n\\n I smiled, both at the suggestion and his use of the nickname. \"No, I need you for something that\u0027s more your specialty. I don\u0027t suppose you\u0027ve ever heard of the Iron Crown?\"\\n\\n Kiyo hadn\u0027t. I provided a brief rundown, explaining how the person who fought through and won it could allegedly inspire fear and awe.\\n\\n \"And that\u0027s enough to make Katrice back off?\" he asked skeptically.\\n\\n \"So they say.\" I shrugged. \"It\u0027s weird to me too, but everyone I\u0027ve talked to claims it\u0027ll intimidate Katrice and her armies.\" Best not to mention that \"everyone\" was Dorian, a ghost, and a crazy seeress. \"It\u0027ll prove what a badass I am. And if that forces her into peace talks ...\" I let him draw his own conclusions.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a gamble,\" Kiyo said. He still sounded doubtful, but there was a crack there. He wanted the war over. He wanted me out of it. \"But why ask me? Why not Dorian?\"\\n\\n \"Because he couldn\u0027t survive the quest. The way\u0027s lined with iron. It would take an insanely strong gentry - or people with human blood, like you and me. Plus, I trust you.\"\\n\\n I didn\u0027t know if the human solidarity had gotten me anywhere, but he was definitely considering this more and more. I also wondered if admitting trust in him did anything. Part of what had driven us apart was my accusation that he didn\u0027t care enough about me to punish Leith.\\n\\n \"I\u0027d like to help you,\" Kiyo said finally. \"It\u0027s crazy - but no crazier than half the stuff around here. I should talk to Maiwenn first, though.\"\\n\\n You must not - under any circumstances - allow him to go back to Maiwenn and consult her on this.\\n\\n \"There\u0027s no time,\" I said, hastily running through Dorian\u0027s laundry list of excuses. \"We have to go now. The ghost who\u0027s going to help me threatened to back out if I didn\u0027t act soon. And we\u0027re currently on hold with Katrice. If I could return with the crown before the next battle, it would be ... well, it\u0027d be amazing. No more bloodshed.\"\\n\\n I could see him wavering, but he wasn\u0027t quite convinced. Really, I didn\u0027t blame him. If I had an ally who could advise me on some bizarre quest, I\u0027d want to talk to her too before jumping in.\\n\\n \"You can talk to her if you want,\" I said. \"But I\u0027ve got to leave now. I can\u0027t stand waiting. I\u0027ll just go by myself.\"\\n\\n That drove the dagger in.
