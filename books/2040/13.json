{"id":109415,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"The journey back was uneventful, the most notable thing being the afterglow that now burned between Kiyo and me - something I now questioned the wisdom of. My words had been true: I\u0027d never stopped caring about him. But he\u0027d been right too: what had happened between us back in the glade had come from my own outrage and need to get back at Dorian. That wasn\u0027t really a good reason to start a relationship. It wasn\u0027t even a really good reason for casual sex, and honestly, I wasn\u0027t sure what my status was with Kiyo at the moment.\n Deanna reappeared and followed along so quietly and obediently that I finally broke the silence to reassure her I\u0027d keep my part of the bargain. Her drab face lit up, and I had to give her credit for not pushing the matter until I settled my other business.\n Kiyo and I went straight to Dorian\u0027s, once we\u0027d crossed back into more familiar territory. My plan was to deal with him first and then jump to the human world. I thought it would be safer to have the crown there. Dorian\u0027s guards met me with pleased grins, and while they were surprised to see Kiyo, most seemed to know I\u0027d been off on some secret mission. Coming back alive was a good sign.\n As soon as we entered the castle, I ordered a messenger to go to Katrice and inform her that I now possessed the Iron Crown and that if she wanted to talk surrender, I was all ears. As Dorian\u0027s consort, I had the power to order around his staff - but I had a feeling that would end soon.\n Kiyo and I were admitted into Dorian\u0027s exalted presence out in a courtyard, where he was making a long-tormented courtier named Muran play the harp. I knew for a fact that Muran had had exactly one lesson, and Dorian seemed quite amused watching the guy struggle through. This kind of thing was one of Dorian\u0027s greatest pastimes, and usually, even though I felt bad for Muran, it provided me with a little amusement. Today I felt none.\n When we entered the courtyard, Dorian took one look at our faces and promptly ordered everyone away - even his guards. He still wore that small, carefree smile, but I\u0027d seen a subtle shift in the lines of his face. He knew something was up. His astuteness was what made him such a good ruler.\n \"Well, here you are,\" he said, sitting back in the gentry equivalent of a lawn chair. Except, of course, I\u0027d never seen Home Depot sell anything so ornate and gilded. Normally when I arrived, Dorian kissed me, but his wariness must have held him back. \"As beautiful as ever, my dear, if a little beat up around the edges. I suppose this means you either succeeded or just barely escaped with your life?\"\n \"We succeeded,\" I said. \"I\u0027ve got the crown.\"\n Again - that smile didn\u0027t change, but an eager light flickered in Dorian\u0027s eyes. He leaned forward. \"I knew it. I knew you could do it.\" He studied me up and down, his gaze finally resting on the bag over my shoulder. \"May I see it?\"\n \"No,\" I said bluntly. \"No one\u0027s going to see it. It\u0027s going to be hidden away where it can\u0027t be used to start eating up people\u0027s lands.\"\n Dorian\u0027s eyebrows rose, and he began to speak. I could already imagine a hundred variations of what was going to come out of his mouth, something along the lines of, \"Whatever are you talking about, my dear?\"\n I stepped forward, my control snapping as I cut him off. \"Don\u0027t start! Don\u0027t even start with some sugar-coated denial. You\u0027ve known all along what the crown could do! You knew it\u0027d scare Katrice because it meant I - and by default you - could take over her kingdom!\"\n Dorian hesitated, and again, I could guess at the thoughts spinning in his head. Denial or backpedaling? He finally went with the latter.\n \"And what better way to push her into peace?\" he said at last. \"The point of a war like this is to eventually march over and subdue someone anyway. Isn\u0027t it much simpler and faster to achieve that same end through another way?\"\n \"A way that rips her land from her!\" I exclaimed. \"And sticks me with another fucking kingdom!\" I stepped forward and had to forcibly keep myself from getting closer. I was so, so angry. So angry that this man I cared about could do this to me. I was almost angrier at him than Katrice at the moment. From her, at least, I expected betrayal. \"And that\u0027s what you would have wanted to do - not just scare her. You would have found some way, some justification for taking that drastic step, just like you got me to go after this in the first place.\"\n Much of the humor had faded from Dorian\u0027s face now. \"And would you have gone after it if you\u0027d known?\"\n \"No.\"\n He shrugged. \"Well, there you have it.\"\n I was aghast. \"That\u0027s it? How the hell can you be so lax about this? How can you act like it\u0027s okay to have tricked me from the beginning - you and that hag? How can you claim to love me and lie to me?\"\n \"I do love you,\" he said. \"More than you know. I did this for your own good.\"\n \"You did it for your own good,\" I snapped. \"I can\u0027t believe I fell for it again. You\u0027ve done this before, and now I\u0027m done. Done with you. Done with all of this. I don\u0027t need your help anymore. I\u0027ll finish this fucking war on my own.\"\n \"Eugenie,\" warned Kiyo softly. He didn\u0027t contradict me, not in front of Dorian, but I understood the subtext. It was the point he\u0027d made before: not to spurn Dorian\u0027s military help.\n Dorian scoffed, sharing that sentiment. \"Of course you need me. If you can get past your hurt pride, you\u0027ll see that we\u0027re in this together. Use the crown however you want, but be reasonable so that the two of us can finally end this war.\"\n My voice was low and dangerous when I spoke. I was furious that he could be so condescending, that he assumed he could just smooth this all over. \"There is no more us.\"\n \"Now you\u0027re just overreacting,\" he said. \"We need to finish this war together, and we need to be together, period. We\u0027re meant to be.\"\n \"No,\" I said. \"We\u0027re done. It\u0027s over.\"\n I could see from his face that he didn\u0027t take that seriously either. He didn\u0027t get it. His ego wouldn\u0027t allow him to. Before he could respond, Kiyo lightly touched my arm. \"Be careful. Look what you\u0027re doing.\"\n I glanced around. The wind was rising and falling, making the apple trees sway back and forth. Dark clouds began to gather above. It wasn\u0027t uncommon for my emotions to unconsciously affect the weather, but the fact that I could do it in a land under someone else\u0027s control was a sign of how much my power had grown. If Dorian had wanted sunny weather, it should have stayed that way. The realization of what I could do was heady. Nonetheless, I pushed back, calming the air and dissipating the storm clouds.\n But Dorian wasn\u0027t concerned about any of that. His attention had snapped to one small gesture: Kiyo\u0027s touch on my arm. I\u0027m not sure how Dorian knew - maybe just the way Kiyo and I stood near each other - but in that moment, Dorian realized what had happened between Kiyo and me. And that, more than any of the arguments here, was what finally broke that laid-back attitude. His face turned to stone.\n \"Oh,\" he said to Kiyo, voice completely devoid of emotion. \"I see. It\u0027s your turn again.\" Outrage filled me at the insinuation that I could be passed around - a sentiment not unlike what Kiyo himself had expressed. Dorian allowed me no chance to counter. \"Well, if that\u0027s how it\u0027s going to be, then that\u0027s how it\u0027s going to be. You may be right that there\u0027s no us, but we are still in this war together. My armies are too enmeshed, and I can hardly let Katrice think I\u0027m backing down. Dareth!\"\n Dorian\u0027s voice rang out, loudly enough that one of the guards behind the glass doors heard. He swiftly opened the doors and stepped outside.\n \"Your Majesty?\"\n \"Please escort the Thorn Queen and her pet from the premises. They are denied hospitality. Do not admit them again. Should any of her household come, they may be allowed into my presence.\" His eyes flicked to me. \"Send Rurik as your proxy for all military matters. He was doing all the work anyway.\" Dorian\u0027s attention went back to his guard. \"You have your orders.\"\n Dareth had trouble keeping the shock off his face. I had become a fixture around here, treated nearly the same as Dorian. After a few moments, Dareth composed his features, his loyalty to his king overriding any disbelief he might feel. He turned to me, expression formal. He gestured inside.\n \"Your Majesty.\"\n The respect was there, but the message was clear. I was being thrown out and could see Dareth practically praying I wouldn\u0027t resist. I didn\u0027t, and while a dozen parting retorts to Dorian filled my head, I shoved them aside. He thrived on that kind of attention. It would only make him feel more important, and I wanted it made clear that I really was done with him - even though the cold reality of what was happening made my heart break.\n Kiyo and I began to follow Dareth without comment, but then I paused. Reaching toward my neck, I ripped off the necklace I wore, the one with Dorian\u0027s ring. I tossed it at his feet, meeting his gaze with a message I hoped he understood. He did. His answered mine with green fury.\n \"I said get out of here.\"\n I turned away, letting Dareth take us to the castle\u0027s front doors. As soon as we were outside, I heard him giving instructions about the revoking of our hospitality. I imagined the other guards shared his shock, but I walked on without looking back. Once Kiyo and I had traveled far enough that the land shifted and put us in Maiwenn\u0027s kingdom, he turned to look at me.\n \"Are you okay?\" he asked, worry in those dark eyes.\n \"Fine,\" I said flatly. I was confident my anger was justified ... but leaving Dorian still hurt. He\u0027d dismissed me so easily, once he\u0027d realized I\u0027d slept with Kiyo. I\u0027d expected something ... something more emotional, I guess. Some sign that I\u0027d meant more to him than a useful consort. I should have known better. \"Let\u0027s go back to Tucson.\"\n I\u0027d kept Volusian and Deanna away while we\u0027d met with Dorian but brought them both back now. I told Deanna to come to my home tomorrow and that we\u0027d start working on her problem then. To Volusian, I gave orders to return to the Thorn Land. He would tell Rurik to go to Dorian and then wait until word came back from Katrice. I had no doubt that word of my being banned from Dorian\u0027s would spread around quickly enough; I didn\u0027t want to see the reactions of my people when that happened.\n Kiyo and I crossed back to Arizona at a nearby gateway, going to his place instead of mine so that he could redo my stitches. He was as good as any \u0027real\u0027 doctor, and I didn\u0027t want to have to explain my new cuts and bruises to someone else. A slew of cats and dogs greeted me when I entered his apartment, making me feel oddly nostalgic.\n \"Are you sure you\u0027re okay?\" Kiyo asked later. I was lying stomach-down on his bed while his needle went to work on the cut.\n My cheek rested on a pillow, my only view being his dresser as I tried to stay still. \"Fine.\"\n \"You keep saying that, but what went down was pretty serious.\" I could imagine the frown on his face. \"I didn\u0027t expect him to pull hospitality.\"\n \"He knows we slept together,\" I said. \"Guys get upset when their girlfriends do that.\" I\u0027d broken up with Dorian in my head the instant I found out about the deception, but as far as he was concerned, I\u0027d cheated on him. Maybe I had. But betraying someone who\u0027d deceived you didn\u0027t seem like that much of a betrayal.\n \"Yes,\" said Kiyo. \"Yes, they do.\" He tied off his thread and re-bandaged it all. \"Please, please do not pull these out again. The fact that this isn\u0027t infected is a miracle.\"\n \"I won\u0027t,\" I said, sitting up and carefully putting my shirt back on. \"I don\u0027t plan on getting in any fights for a while. I\u0027m staying out of the Otherworld until they really need me, and investigating Deanna\u0027s murder should only involve questions. Actually, I\u0027m hoping to pass it off on someone else.\"\n \"She won\u0027t like that,\" he said.\n \"It\u0027ll get it done,\" I said. \"And she\u0027ll like that. Probably even faster than if I did it.\"\n I started to stand, but Kiyo caught hold of my hand and kept me down. His expression turned sly. \"You want to stay for a while?\"\n I shook my head, smiling faintly. \"I\u0027ve got some things to do. Besides, just because we did what we did doesn\u0027t mean ... well, it doesn\u0027t mean things are the same again.\"\n His mischievous smile faded. \"You\u0027re right. A lot kind of got rushed. I suppose we should ... I don\u0027t know. Do you want to go on a date?\"\n \"A date?\" I laughed in spite of myself. It seemed so out of place after what we\u0027d been through these last few days. Too ordinary. \"Dinner and a movie?\"\n \"Something like that. I could pick you up later, after your errands are done. Or tomorrow if you need a little more time.\"\n A little more time? Maybe I needed a lot more time. I really didn\u0027t know. I might have jumped into bed - figuratively speaking - right after my relationship with Dorian had crumbled, but as I\u0027d said, that didn\u0027t mean I was ready to establish something committed with Kiyo again. I\u0027d had sex with Kiyo in the throes of my anger; I had more to think about now that I\u0027d cooled down - and seen Dorian\u0027s face. My head told me we were through, but my heart already missed him.\n \"Tomorrow,\" I said.\n Kiyo nodded. \"Fair enough. I should probably check in at the clinic anyway.\"\n I honestly didn\u0027t understand the terms of Kiyo\u0027s employment. With his constant visits to the Otherworld, he didn\u0027t seem to have any regular schedule with the emergency vet clinic he worked at. He just seemed to show up whenever he wanted. It was more convenient than my own job for maintaining a dual existence between worlds.\n Confused feelings or not, I let him kiss me good-bye before I left. There was a part of me that wished I could just stay with him, hiding out in his bed and avoiding the rest of the world. Worlds, even. But I had too much to do.\n The first thing was to get home and change into clean clothes. I arrived to what initially appeared to be an empty house, but the cars in the driveway tipped me off. Sure enough, a minute or so after I walked inside, I heard Tim\u0027s bedroom door open. He emerged, wearing only jeans, his black hair standing in all directions.\n \"Hey, Eug. Didn\u0027t expect to see you back.\"\n \"Apparently not. I take it Lara\u0027s in there?\"\n He had the grace to look sheepish. \"Ah, well - \"\n \"Hi, Eugenie.\" Lara appeared in the kitchen beside him, her hair as messed up as his. Her clothes - including Tim\u0027s \"West Coast Powwow 2002\" T-shirt - showed signs of hasty assembly. She was blushing, but her embarrassment turned to surprise as she eyed my appearance. She still wasn\u0027t used to seeing me in real life. \"Rough day?\"\n \"Days,\" I said.\n \"Oh ... I don\u0027t suppose ... I don\u0027t suppose you\u0027d be interested in hearing about some job offers?\" It was the first time she\u0027d been hesitant to bring up work. I think she was finally starting to understand the grueling nature of my life and that back-to-back jobs weren\u0027t as easy as checking items off a list.\n \"Not really. Not for a few days.\"\n \"A few - \" She bit off her protest and meekly nodded.\n I walked around them, heading for my room. \"I\u0027ve got things to do,\" I called back to them. \"So you can go back to ... whatever it is you were doing.\"\n Truthfully, I didn\u0027t want to do the task hanging before me. I wanted to find whatever baked goods Tim had squirreled away in the kitchen and then take that nap I\u0027d longed for at Kiyo\u0027s. But, no. I\u0027d made a promise to Deanna, one I had to honor, no matter how messed up the rest of my life was. So, after cleaning up and changing, I sat on the edge of my bed and picked up my cell phone. I stared at it for a long time, running my fingers along its edges as I procrastinated. Finally, I dialed a memorized number and waited.\n There was a good chance that no one would answer. I was calling my mom\u0027s cell phone, though, which gave me better odds than if I\u0027d called her house number. I knew Roland had asked her to keep her distance from me, but after seeing me at the hospital, my mom would likely resist any directives like that - if only out of fear that I\u0027d lost a limb or something.\n \"Hello?\"\n My breath caught, and I almost couldn\u0027t speak. Just that one word ... the sound of her voice. It sent a flood of emotions through me, and I forced myself to remember my mission here.\n \"Mom?\"\n \"Genie? Are you okay?\" she asked promptly. As suspected, she feared limb loss.\n \"Yeah, yeah, fine. How are you?\"\n \"Fine. Worried about you - like always.\"\n \"I\u0027m okay,\" I said. \"Really. But I need ... I, um, need to talk to Roland.\"\n Long silence.\n \"Eugenie - \"\n \"I know, I know. But I need his help with something. It won\u0027t take long. Just one question. Please.\"\n She sighed. \"Oh, baby. I wish I could, but he\u0027s made it clear ... You know how he feels about everything....\"\n \"It\u0027s a human thing,\" I said, only partially lying. \"A job in this world. Please, Mom. Just ask him if he\u0027ll talk to me for a minute?\"\n More silence, then another sigh. \"Hang on.\"\n I waited, nervously twisting the fabric of my bed\u0027s duvet. What would happen? The two most likely options were that either my mom would relay his refusal or they would simply hang up on me. But, no. It was Roland\u0027s voice I heard next.\n \"Yes?\" Cold. Wary.\n After everything that had just happened to me in the Otherworld, hearing his voice nearly broke me. I wanted to sob and beg him to forgive me. Beg him to love me again. My mom had undoubtedly done a fair share of that already, though. She\u0027d clearly had no luck. I had no reason to believe I\u0027d fare any better, so I made my tone match his as I swallowed back tears. Just business here.\n \"I need a referral,\" I said brusquely. \"To a private investigator. One who isn\u0027t going to be freaked out by the stuff we deal with. I figured you must know someone.\"\n \"You need a P.I. to deal with some monster?\" he asked harshly.\n \"No, no. It actually should be pretty mundane - all human stuff. But considering what we do ... Well, I thought I should have someone prepared in case things get weird.\" I didn\u0027t have any reason for Deanna to interact directly with a P.I. - or for me even to mention her - but I wanted to be safe.\n \"Well,\" said Roland. \"Let\u0027s make it clear: \u0027we\u0027 don\u0027t do the same kinds of things.\"\n With great effort, I bit off the retorts that wanted to burst out of me. I wanted to explain for the hundredth time that I\u0027d never expected - or wanted - to reach this level of involvement in the Otherworld. Again, I opted for directness.\n \"Please, Roland,\" I said simply. \"This is for a human family. Just forget about me for a minute.\"\n When he didn\u0027t respond, I thought for sure the anticipated hang-up would come. \"Enrique Valdez,\" he said at last. \"You should be able to look up his number. I\u0027ll call too and give him a heads-up.\"\n \"Oh, Roland. Thank you so - \"\n Click.\n There it was. I pulled the phone away and held it in front of me again, staring at it as though it were to blame for all my problems. A few moments later, I tossed it on the floor. Anger surged through me, quickly fading into sadness. My eyes fell on my travel pack in the corner, the pack containing the Iron Crown. That - and all it represented - was the source of my problems.\n I fell back onto my bed, staring up at the glow-in-the-dark stars stuck on my ceiling. Roland, Dorian ... I was losing the men in my life. Why, why had Dorian done that? Why had he let me fall in love with him, only to play me? Was that what love meant to him? Was that how all his relationships worked? He\u0027d hurt me, hurt me so terribly, and the petty, dark voice that lived inside me said that if sleeping with Kiyo had hurt Dorian in return, it was no more than he deserved.\n Kiyo.\n Kiyo was all I had left now, and I didn\u0027t know if I could trust him either. Before I could ruminate very much on that particular woe, a cold presence filled the room. I sat up quickly, putting aside all my self-pity as Volusian materialized before me.\n \"Mistress,\" he said.\n \"Volusian,\" I replied. \"What\u0027s going on?\"\n \"I\u0027ve come with a message, as you requested.\" As always, his words were emotionless, yet he somehow conveyed the feeling that he resented every one of them. \"Queen Katrice has responded to your news of the Iron Crown.\"\n That was fast, even for the Otherworld. \"And?\"\n \"And, she has agreed to a temporary truce.\"\n I shot up from the bed. \"You have got to be kidding.\"\n Volusian didn\u0027t respond. I\u0027d long since learned that any comment I made about him joking or kidding was treated rhetorically. Volusian did not joke or kid.\n \"It worked,\" I murmured, more to myself than him. \"I can\u0027t believe it. Dorian was right.\"\n \"Indeed. But I assume my mistress will not resume carnal relations with him.\"\n I made a face. If there was anyone I hated discussing my sex life with more than Jasmine, it was Volusian. \"No. It doesn\u0027t matter if he was right. He lied to me to make it happen. He should have told me the whole story. He used half-truth means to achieve his ends.\"\n Volusian nodded solemnly. \"I told you that long ago, that the Oak King\u0027s own agenda will always come first. As will the kitsune\u0027s. But, unsurprisingly, my mistress chooses to ignore the only sound advice given to her and instead listens to those who use affection for their own purposes.\" The word \u0027affection\u0027 was spoken with particular venom.\n \"Kiyo and Dorian don\u0027t - Look. Stay out of this, okay? I never asked for your \u0027sound\u0027 advice. Get back to Katrice. How does this truce work exactly?\"\n \"Hostilities will cease until all parties are able to discuss the current situation. How said discussion proceeds will be settled beforehand by messengers. You and the Oak King may meet with her directly, or you may have representatives do the negotiating.\"\n I tried to picture myself in a room with Dorian and Katrice. Lovely. \"And where would this happen? I\u0027m sure as hell not going to the Rowan Land.\"\n \"That too will be negotiated during this truce,\" he said. \"A neutral kingdom is the most likely choice. Shaya would like to discuss that with you at your earliest convenience.\"\n \"I\u0027m sure she would. Go back and tell her I trust her to set up whatever arrangements need to be made. If I have to go myself ... well, then I go. I\u0027ll check in with her soon, but come back if anything happens in the meantime.\" Volusian waited, and I gestured him away. \"Go.\"\n He vanished, and I sank onto my bed. My eyes fell on the concealed Iron Crown once again, and I dared to wonder if maybe some good had come out of this whole mess. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/iron-crowned-dark-swan-3/page-13.html","bookId":2040,"book":{"id":2040,"title":"Iron Crowned (Dark Swan #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Dark Swan Series Book 3: Iron Crowned \n An embattled realm mystically entwined with our own, the Otherworld is at the mercy of one woman...Shaman-for-hire Eugenie Markham is the best at banishing entities trespassing in the mortal realm.
