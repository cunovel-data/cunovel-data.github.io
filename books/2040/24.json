{"id":109426,"no":24,"title":"Page 24","content":"\"What?\" exclaimed Jasmine.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t share her concern. \"Damn it. I should have banished you the first time I saw you. I don\u0027t have time for this, not with everything else. You should be in the Underworld by now. Kiyo isn\u0027t going to kill me.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m serious!\" said Deanna, as frantic as a ghost could get. \"You\u0027re in danger!\"\\n\\n I shook my head. \"Look, I\u0027m sorry about your husband ... really, I am. But not every guy is homicidal. Don\u0027t transfer this to me.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not! This is real. I was going to move on after ... after ... well, after my husband was arrested....\" There was a mournful pause. Her story had come to a close, but it hadn\u0027t had a happy ending. \"I wanted to say good-bye formally and went looking for you ... but found Kiyo instead ...\"\\n\\n I put my hands on my hips, wishing I\u0027d brought my wand. I did not need a delusional ghost, not with everything else right now. \"And then he said he was going to kill me?\"\\n\\n \"No. He told that other queen he would.\"\\n\\n That cut off my snark, leaving me speechless for a moment.\\n\\n \"What other queen?\" demanded Jasmine.\\n\\n \"The blond one. The Willow Queen.\"\\n\\n Jasmine and I exchanged looks. Suddenly, Deanna\u0027s crazy statements had become slightly less crazy.\\n\\n \"What exactly did you overhear?\" I asked quietly.\\n\\n \"He told her you were pregnant and that you\u0027d have an abortion if it was a boy ... but that he was concerned. He was worried because you hadn\u0027t just done it already.\" Deanna looked back and forth between our faces, desperate for either of us to believe her. \"He said it was probably just shock and that you\u0027d \u0027do the right thing,\u0027 but that if you didn\u0027t ... well, Maiwenn said they\u0027d have to make you lose the baby. Or ... if that didn\u0027t work ... that Kiyo would kill you.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s insane,\" I said. \"Kiyo wouldn\u0027t kill me.\"\\n\\n \"Kiyo doesn\u0027t want the prophecy to come true,\" said Jasmine. \"It\u0027s not that insane.\"\\n\\n I turned on her. \"He loves me. This whole idea ... it\u0027s ridiculous.\"\\n\\n \"Why would I lie?\" said Deanna. \"You helped me. I\u0027m helping you by warning you before I move on to the next world. I\u0027m telling you, I heard them. Kiyo swore he\u0027d make sure the prophecy couldn\u0027t be fulfilled.\"\\n\\n \"Kiyo. Loves. Me.\"\\n\\n \"Dorian loves you too,\" pointed out Jasmine. \"And look what he did. When you think about it, Kiyo\u0027s the type who\u0027d think one tragic loss of life was worth saving many. Or something stupid like that.\"\\n\\n \"He would.\" Admitting it surprised me, and yet ... as the meaning of Deanna\u0027s words sank deeper and deeper, I remembered my first meeting with Kiyo. He\u0027d found me on Maiwenn\u0027s orders. They hadn\u0027t known what kind of person I was, if I\u0027d wanted to fulfill the prophecy or not. He\u0027d never said so explicitly, but my impression had been that both were willing to go to extreme means to stop Storm King\u0027s heir from being born. Our relationship had obviously changed since then, but maybe ... maybe some things hadn\u0027t....\\n\\n \"But he wouldn\u0027t go that far,\" I finished.\\n\\n \"Do you want to take that chance?\" asked Jasmine softly. \"Maybe he wouldn\u0027t really kill you, but you heard what he said about Maiwenn\u0027s \u0027magic\u0027 abortion.\"\\n\\n What had Deanna claimed? That Kiyo and Maiwenn had planned to make me terminate the pregnancy if I wouldn\u0027t willingly?\\n\\n \"We just need to talk,\" I said, hoping I sounded convincing. My next words gave me away. \"Somewhere I know I\u0027m safe.\"\\n\\n \"Kiyo\u0027s in the waiting room,\" said Jasmine, seeing that I was finally taking this seriously. \"Is this a safe place?\"\\n\\n \"Probably not.\" I had finished getting dressed. \"There must be a back door. There\u0027s always a back door. We\u0027ll go ... we\u0027ll go home. I\u0027ll get my weapons, and then we\u0027ll go to the Otherworld. He and I can talk about this reasonably in the Thorn Land. I\u0027ll be safe there.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ll never make it there,\" said Deanna. I\u0027d practically forgotten about her. \"He can follow you. As soon as you leave here, he\u0027ll know and come after you.\"\\n\\n \"How could he - \"\\n\\n I lightly touched my upper arm, the spot where Kiyo\u0027s nails had barely dug in the other night. I took a deep, shaking breath. \"He marked me,\" I said. He\u0027d scratched me the first night we\u0027d met too, leaving a long-healing wound that allowed him to track me wherever I went. This one was smaller but would work just as well.\\n\\n Jasmine was already moving toward the door, so full of tension and purpose that she seemed much older. \"We\u0027ll just go straight to the Otherworld then. You\u0027ll be safe there. Where\u0027s the nearest gateway?\"\\n\\n I racked my brain, thinking of our location. \"By Morriswood Park. Farther than I\u0027d like.\"\\n\\n \"Well, we have to go soon. If we stay here any longer, the doctor\u0027ll come ask what\u0027s wrong,\" said Jasmine. \"And we can\u0027t let Kiyo find us in the parking lot.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ll never make it to the park in time,\" wailed Deanna. I scowled, but she was right. Jasmine looked at me questioningly. For a moment, I considered calling Volusian, but he might happily kill Kiyo and claim it was in my defense. I wasn\u0027t ready for that.\\n\\n \"I know where we can go,\" I said. \"Come on.\"\\n\\n We left the exam room, stepping out into the hallway. I turned with purpose, opposite the direction of the waiting room we\u0027d entered from. This took us deeper into the clinic, past more examining rooms and their lab. A couple staff members passed us, but we walked confidently enough that no one stopped us. They probably assumed we\u0027d been directed somewhere. Meanwhile, my eyes were searching for an exit sign. There had to be a back door. Surely hypocritical health professionals had to go somewhere to smoke.\\n\\n \"There.\"\\n\\n I nodded toward an exit sign, praying it didn\u0027t lead to a fire door, which would be of no use to us. Nope. It was just an ordinary door, one probably used for maintenance or shipments. Someone did notice us then and start to ask what we were doing, but by then, we were outside and behind the building.\\n\\n \"Eugenie, where are we going?\" asked Jasmine anxiously. Deanna had faded away, perhaps now finally leaving this world after fulfilling what she believed to be her last duty. As we walked briskly toward my car, some part of me kept wanting to think she\u0027d lied. But why? As she\u0027d said, she had no reason. She\u0027d held true to me before.\\n\\n And with every passing second, I grew more and more conflicted, wondering what I should believe. Kiyo loved me. He\u0027d gone out of his way to win me back ... but he was firmly set on protecting the human world. At any cost? We\u0027d see. Deanna was mistaken; she had to be. My worst fate was probably going to be Kiyo\u0027s talking me to death.\\n\\n We got in the car, and I did briefly consider trying to make a break for Morriswood Park and its Otherworldly gate. After all, what was Kiyo going to do? Get in a high speed chase with us? The thing was, with that mark, he would be able to track me. He could probably feel me moving away now. If we headed anywhere near the park he\u0027d figure it out. He\u0027d either try to beat us there or just catch up with us on the other side. No, I had to go somewhere else. Somewhere with protection. Somewhere I could be sure I was safe until all of this madness was settled.\\n\\n Jasmine\u0027s face grew increasingly troubled as we drove away from the doctor\u0027s office. She kept glancing back, as though expecting to see Kiyo right on our bumper. When we turned into a suburban neighborhood, her worry shifted to confusion.\\n\\n \"What is this?\"\\n\\n \"Home,\" I replied, pulling into the driveway of a well-kept house surrounded by trees and flowers. A fence enclosed the backyard but couldn\u0027t hide the efforts someone had made to turn a Tucson backyard into something lush and green.\\n\\n The gate in the fence was unlocked as I\u0027d known it would be. The yard was unoccupied, save for birds and insects. The house\u0027s patio door had its glass open, covered only by a screen that let in the afternoon air. It too would be unlocked.\\n\\n \"Kiyo won\u0027t really do it,\" I muttered, as I jerked the door open. \"Maybe he\u0027s upset ... but we can talk this out. Deanna overreacted. We\u0027re overreacting.\"\\n\\n We stepped into a small breakfast nook, and in the adjacent kitchen, a man spun around. My heart leapt when I saw him. The familiar, kind face. The graying hair. The tattoos of whorls and fishes. It felt like a lifetime since our last meeting.\\n\\n Roland.\\n\\n I\u0027d gone to my parents\u0027 house.\\n\\n Roland\u0027s reactions were those of a man who\u0027d spent years fighting and training, but even that didn\u0027t prepare him for the sight of us. Astonishment filled his features, quickly giving way to outrage.\\n\\n \"Eugenie! What are you - \"\\n\\n \"Get your weapons,\" I ordered, casting an uneasy glance behind me. Jasmine followed as I strode toward him. \"Whatever you\u0027ve got in the house.\"\\n\\n He didn\u0027t move. \"You know you\u0027re not - \"\\n\\n \"Get them!\" I exclaimed. \"We don\u0027t have time for this!\"\\n\\n I don\u0027t know what look I wore on my face, but it was enough to pierce the walls of hurt and anger he\u0027d built between us since learning of my involvement in the Otherworld. I\u0027d taken a risk coming here, a gamble that no matter what happened, Roland would protect me. And I was right. He transformed before my eyes, suddenly the concerned and caring stepfather I\u0027d grown up with.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s - \"\\n\\n Before he could finish, the screen door flew open. Kiyo stood there, face dark and stormy.\\n\\n \"What the hell are you doing?\" he demanded. \"Why did you take off?\"\\n\\n \"You first,\" I said, taking a step back toward Roland. \"What are you doing?\" Jasmine moved to my other side. My eyes were on Kiyo, but I could sense Roland bracing for battle. Maybe he didn\u0027t know what was going on, but anyone could have seen how dangerous Kiyo was.\\n\\n \"I wanted to talk to you, and you disappeared!\" Kiyo moved forward a little but stopped, recognizing the united front that Roland and I - and yes, even Jasmine - presented.\\n\\n \"Talk? Is that all you wanted to do?\"\\n\\n \"Yes. Of course.\" Kiyo glanced between all of us. \"You promised, Eugenie. You promised if it was a boy, you\u0027d get rid of it.\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s a girl too!\" I exclaimed. \"You can\u0027t get rid of one without the other.\"\\n\\n \"It doesn\u0027t matter,\" he said. \"The consequences are too big.\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t kill an innocent. She hasn\u0027t done anything.\"\\n\\n \"Not directly. Letting her live means he lives. And there\u0027s nothing innocent there. He can\u0027t live. Eugenie, you know that. I\u0027m not trying to be cruel. Please. Do what\u0027s right.\"\\n\\n Jasmine and Roland remained silent as this drama played out. Meanwhile, I realized how sickened the language of this whole matter continued to make me. Get rid of it. He can\u0027t live.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re so quick to kill your own children,\" I said in disbelief, echoing what Jasmine had said a few days before. \"Don\u0027t you feel any remorse? You know better than me what it\u0027s like to be a parent!\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" he said, clenching his fists. \"I do know. And it\u0027s amazing. I wish you could know what it\u0027s like....\"\\n\\n \"But I can\u0027t? I can\u0027t have the same chance you and Maiwenn had?\"\\n\\n Kiyo shook his head. \"You aren\u0027t the same as Maiwenn. You can\u0027t ever be.\"\\n\\n It was like a gut-punch. I was stunned into silence, and a bit of his fierceness eased. I think he read my reaction as acceptance.\\n\\n \"Look, I don\u0027t get this,\" he said. \"I don\u0027t get why you\u0027re resisting all of this after what you\u0027ve always said! You never wanted a baby - any baby. If you\u0027ve changed your mind, then ... well, try again. You just can\u0027t have these.\"\\n\\n \"And what then? I just keep having abortions until a girl comes along? What kind of a sick bastard are you?\" I moved forward without realizing it, my anger exploding. Roland put a hand on my arm, keeping me back. It wasn\u0027t affection. It was a warning. It was defensive strategy, keeping us together.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m trying to protect the human world,\" Kiyo said. He hadn\u0027t come any closer, but he was as ready as we were, his reflexes even faster. \"And you should be too.\"\\n\\n \"And what happens if I don\u0027t do what you want?\" I asked quietly. Here it was, the moment of truth.\\n\\n He sighed. \"I don\u0027t want it to come to that.\"\\n\\n \"To what?\" My voice rose sharply, the anguish in me ready to explode. \"What will you do?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll take you to Maiwenn - by force. And then ... and then she\u0027ll take care of it.\"\\n\\n \"The hell you will,\" I said. Goddamnit, I wished I had a weapon. I almost always traveled with them - but not to the doctor\u0027s office. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Roland\u0027s hand rest on the counter and wrap around something. A wand. He\u0027d had his wand in the kitchen. But of course he would. Unlike me, he hadn\u0027t become careless. \"I\u0027ll never let that happen. You guys aren\u0027t going to experiment on me!\"\\n\\n Kiyo\u0027s face displayed a mix of emotions. There was sorrow and disappointment. He did care. He didn\u0027t want this fight between us - but he also believed in his greater good. He believed he had to do anything to stop the prophecy, and I knew then that Deanna had spoken the truth. Ideally, he just wanted the pregnancy to end. If that wasn\u0027t possible, then I was what needed to be eliminated.\\n\\n \"How can you do this?\" he asked, his voice both a threat and a plea. \"How can you risk all this - just to save one life?\"\\n\\n It was only in that moment, as the words left my lips, that I learned the truth about myself, what I\u0027d been holding deep inside. The girl and boy thing didn\u0027t matter. Only the heartbeats did - those tiny, rapid heartbeats pounding in my ears ...\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not,\" I told him. \"I\u0027m saving two lives.\"\\n\\n I sealed my fate with that. Kiyo moved so fast that I wasn\u0027t prepared for the attack. He sprang toward me, shape-shifting as he did into his giant fox form, fangs out, snarling. A blast of wind slowed - but didn\u0027t stop - his leap, providing enough time for Roland to jerk me out of the way. The wind magic hadn\u0027t come from me. It had been Jasmine, which was why the power hadn\u0027t packed much of a punch. The unaccustomed magic left her gasping, but it had been enough to buy us a brief escape.\\n\\n Roland pulled me out of the kitchen, out to where we had more space to maneuver in the living room. Kiyo followed without hesitation, all brute strength and speed.\\n\\n \"He can be banished,\" I gasped out to Roland. \"The same as a gentry.\"\\n\\n Roland gave a brisk nod of acknowledgment. He already knew this, but in the sudden flurry, he didn\u0027t have the necessary pause to do a full banishing. Kiyo reached us, throwing himself on me and pushing me away from Roland. I fell hard to the ground, Kiyo\u0027s weight pinning me there. As quickly as he\u0027d turned fox, he transformed back into a man. Still displaying amazing speed, he pulled me up by the arm. I didn\u0027t know if his intentions were simply to cart me out of the house or to attempt a world-jump then and there, but I didn\u0027t give him the chance. I\u0027d recovered my senses and took hold of my magic. The air grew thick, and a hurricane-worthy gust blasted him away - along with a substantial part of my parents\u0027 furniture.\\n\\n Kiyo grimaced as he regained his footing and agonizingly took one step at a time toward me.\\n\\n \"Damn it!\" he yelled over the roar of the wind. \"Stop this!\"\\n\\n \"You stop this!\" I shouted back. The magic burned in my blood, and no matter how annoyingly weak the pregnancy had made me, my power hadn\u0027t diminished too much. \"We don\u0027t even know that this prophecy\u0027s real! I\u0027ve already met one fake seeress. It could all be for nothing.\" Roland and my mother had once told me that prophecies were a dime a dozen in the Otherworld, and I\u0027d seen that to a certain extent. Until now, I\u0027d never wanted to take the chance that mine wouldn\u0027t come true.\\n\\n \"But we don\u0027t know!\" Kiyo countered. I could see the irritation on his face. I was keeping a storm raging around me, one that held him at bay while hopefully Roland began a banishing. \"We can\u0027t risk it. Please. Please come back with me to Maiwenn. We\u0027ll fix this.\"\\n\\n I didn\u0027t answer and instead kept the storm going. My gaze stayed on Kiyo, but I felt the tingle of shamanic magic - human magic - beginning to glimmer. Roland was indeed performing a banishing spell.\\n\\n Kiyo transformed into a fox again, and with that extra strength, he managed to push through the storm-shield around me and knock me to the ground again. He stayed as a fox this time, holding onto that strength. His teeth bit into my shirt, through to my shoulder, and I yelled out in pain. My magic wavered, and to my astonishment, he began dragging me - slowly - across the living room.\\n\\n His progress was halted when a small end table slammed into his back. I tell you, those things are lethal. Instinctively, he reared up against his attacker: Jasmine. He shoved her away, and she stumbled back. Snarling, Kiyo returned to me, and I had the uneasy feeling my odds were getting worse as to whether he\u0027d cart me away or just kill me. He could hold on to human thoughts in fox form, but they became increasingly influenced by animal reactions the longer he stayed transformed.\\n\\n He suddenly looked away from me, gold eyes on Roland, who stood planted firmly across the room with his wand extended. I\u0027d sensed the banishing earlier because of my training. Now, with the spell in full force, Kiyo could feel it too. Abandoning me for the new threat, Kiyo raced toward Roland. I screamed as all that animal power slammed into my stepfather, pinning him against the wall. The wand flew from Roland\u0027s hand. The banishing spell disintegrated.\\n\\n Kiyo shifted to human form again, still trapping Roland. Roland was strong but couldn\u0027t match Kiyo\u0027s strength. Struggling was useless.\\n\\n \"Stop it,\" cried Kiyo. \"Both of you.\"\\n\\n His arm pressed against Roland\u0027s neck. Roland managed a gasp as the grip cut off his air. Immediately, I let the storm magic around me drop. As I did, I felt that Jasmine had been lending her strength to me without me even realizing it. She too ceased her wielding and struggled up from where she\u0027d been knocked down, coming to stand with me once again. The room fell eerily still.\\n\\n \"Let him go,\" I growled, moving slightly forward. I knew I couldn\u0027t win against Kiyo in a physical fight, but I also couldn\u0027t let him harm Roland. \"This isn\u0027t about him. Don\u0027t hurt him.\"\\n\\n \"Believe me,\" said Kiyo, \"I don\u0027t want to.\" His eyes were dark and human again, but there was still some feral glint in there. \"Come with me, and I\u0027ll release him.\"\\n\\n \"Come with you,\" I said flatly. \"To Maiwenn\u0027s?\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ll thank me later,\" said Kiyo.\\n\\n My mind raced frantically. Roland was struggling for breath. How much longer did he have? Would Kiyo really kill him? I wondered if I could get off another blast of magic. Another attack of wind? Lightning? I could create a controlled bolt indoors, but it\u0027d probably kill both men. And if I went with Kiyo ... let him take me to Maiwenn ... well. There\u0027d be no getting out of that, no escape.\\n\\n Roland looked ready to pass out. His blue eyes were fixed on me, and then, quickly, he glanced toward my feet. I thought it was him about to lose consciousness, but then I saw the purpose in his eyes. His wand was near my feet, within easy reach. I didn\u0027t let on to Kiyo that I\u0027d noticed. Roland\u0027s eyes returned to me, some message there.\\n\\n \"Please,\" I begged, wondering frantically what Roland wanted me to do. \"Let him go.\" I couldn\u0027t pull off a banishing spell. There wasn\u0027t enough time. Kiyo would release Roland, true, but then I\u0027d be the one attacked again. I honestly didn\u0027t know how long Kiyo would play it safe. He was attempting \"reasonable\" solutions: force me to go to Maiwenn, blackmail with Roland, et cetera. Sooner or later, if he truly believed the prophecy\u0027s threat, he would simply eliminate me.\\n\\n Roland was still staring at me, still wanting me to do something he thought would save us. He\u0027d trained me. Surely I could figure it out. I had to. What could a wand do? It cast spells. It banished creatures, sending them out of this world....\\n\\n I felt my eyes widen. I knew what he was telling me to do. Doing it would save him, I was certain, because Kiyo would release him and come after me ... into the Otherworld. Roland wanted me to open a gateway for myself. I could do it. It was a fast spell, one I had the power for. Forcing another being through was what took so much time and effort. But opening the gate and stepping through? That could be done quickly.\\n\\n If it could be done. Getting in was easy. Passing through the worlds unassisted was hard, and I\u0027d even had trouble going through fixed, physical gates lately in my weakened state. Making a blind, unaided transition might not even be possible for me. I\u0027d done it once before, and it had required a lot of power. And dear God, had it hurt. If I could do it, though ... I\u0027d get away from Kiyo, and Kiyo would let Roland go in order to chase me down. This could buy me the time to flee to safety.\\n\\n The only thing that might make it possible was that I had anchors in the Otherworld to help pull me in. If I jumped with no solid destination, I could end up trapped between the worlds, my essence disintegrated. Hell, that might still happen, but an anchor would reduce the likelihood. I didn\u0027t know where I was in relation to the Otherworld\u0027s layout, but the closest anchor would pull me in if this worked.\\n\\n Time to find out.\\n\\n With speed that rivaled Kiyo\u0027s, I reached for the wand and then grabbed hold of Jasmine\u0027s hand. Bringing her only made my task more difficult, but I wouldn\u0027t leave her to Kiyo. With the wand, I summoned the necessary magic and ripped open a gate to the Otherworld. Kiyo realized what was happening and released Roland, trying to reach me - but it was too late. I threw myself into the opening, clinging to Jasmine, and knew it would shut immediately behind us, simply because I couldn\u0027t hold open a personal gate for long.\\n\\n It felt just as painful as last time, like I was crashing through the floors in a building. Down, down, down. Smash, smash, smash. Each layer was more agonizing than the last, and with each blow, I felt like I was being torn apart. It was likely I was, and I would destroy Jasmine with me, ripping our souls from our bodies.\\n\\n Then, I sensed a tug. My soul turned toward it, and I felt my fractured self coalesce and become whole, even as that falling, excruciating sensation continued. Then - there was only one impact left: a real one. Jasmine and I slammed into a hard stone floor. My body cried out at the pain. True, physical pain. I had already been hurting from the fight with Kiyo, and now, crashing through the worlds had taken that pain to new levels.\\n\\n Nausea welled up in me, and I fought hard not to throw up. I could hear Jasmine whimpering, but the sights around us were a blur as my disoriented mind tried to get a hold of itself. Finally, the world came into focus, the colors and lines growing sharp once more. A faint hum of magic in the air, one that was always present, told me I\u0027d made it intact to the Otherworld.\\n\\n And Dorian was looking down at me. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/iron-crowned-dark-swan-3/page-24.html","bookId":2040,"book":{"id":2040,"title":"Iron Crowned (Dark Swan #3)","description":"Storyline: Dark Swan Series Book 3: Iron Crowned \\n An embattled realm mystically entwined with our own, the Otherworld is at the mercy of one woman...Shaman-for-hire Eugenie Markham is the best at banishing entities trespassing in the mortal realm.
