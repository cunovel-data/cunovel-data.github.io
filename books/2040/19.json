{"id":109421,"no":19,"title":"Page 19","content":"It took awhile before Kiyo, Jasmine, and I could return to Tucson. We had to go to the Thorn Land, of course, where Shaya and the others asked me all sorts of questions about what had happened and what I wanted to do. Kiyo and even Jasmine provided most of the answers for me because honestly, I wasn\u0027t sure what I wanted now. The only thing I had the real sense to do was demand Jasmine\u0027s key and unlock her chains. She stared at her freed hands wonderingly, stroking her wrists. I nearly left the chains and key in the castle but soon reconsidered and took them with me to the human world.\n She\u0027d never seen my house before and regarded it with approval as we entered. All was quiet, and the empty driveway made me confident I wouldn\u0027t find Tim and Lara holed up in his bedroom again. Evidence of their \"love,\" however, was still obvious.\n \"Damn them,\" I said, gingerly picking a red lace bra off of the couch and tossing it down the hall toward Tim\u0027s room. \"I\u0027m going to have to sanitize this thing. Probably every other piece of furniture too.\"\n \"You have Pop-Tarts!\" Jasmine hadn\u0027t made it to the living room. She\u0027d stopped in the kitchen, opening every drawer and cupboard she could find. \"And Apple Jacks! Peanut butter, ranch dressing, saltines ...\"\n I was surprised that last one excited her so much, but after a couple years eating gentry food, even the most mundane human cuisine was probably exciting.\n \"Oh!\" she exclaimed. \"Can I have one of your Milky Ways?\"\n \"Sure. Have whatever you want.\"\n Her eyes were wide as she tore into the package, and both Kiyo and I watched her with smiles on our faces, like proud parents on Christmas morning. Although they didn\u0027t sound good to me right now, Milky Ways were normally my candy bar of choice. From the way she was consuming hers, Jasmine appeared to share that family trait. She completed her sugar rush with a can of Coke and then made herself at home on the couch. Watching her reach eagerly for the remote control, I decided it was best not to mention the amorous activities that had likely occurred where she sat.\n She flipped through the channels in continued amazement. It was evening - prime time entertainment - and the emotions on her face were transparent as she stumbled across old and new shows alike.\n \"You want me to see if I can find anything that fits you?\" I asked. She might have slipped back easily to human behaviors, but she still wore a long, flowing gentry-style gown.\n \"Sure,\" she said, not looking up from the screen.\n Kiyo followed me into my bedroom. \"You think she\u0027s safe out there?\" he asked. \"Alone?\"\n \"Yeah, I do actually.\" Jasmine and I weren\u0027t the same size, but I found some drawstring shorts that would likely fit. \"I don\u0027t know why ... but I feel like I can trust her.\"\n \"Be careful,\" he warned, sitting on the bed\u0027s edge. \"For all we know, she was happy to be captured and have Cassius throw himself at her.\"\n \"He didn\u0027t do anything.\" I found the smallest T-shirt I could; her frame was more slender than mine.\n \"So she says.\"\n I sighed and faced him. \"Kiyo, you\u0027ve got to trust me. I can\u0027t explain it, but she\u0027s telling the truth. Is she going to turn into a normal teen and forget about her plans to have Storm King\u0027s heir? Unlikely. But for now, she\u0027s in shock and not dangerous.\"\n \"If you think so. Just be careful, Eug. You\u0027ve been tricked by people you\u0027ve trusted before.\"\n \"Surprise, surprise. A slam on Dorian.\" I crossed my arms, holding the clothes to my chest. \"Soon to be followed by a lecture on seizing the Rowan Land.\" I\u0027d been bracing myself since it all happened, but during the ensuing damage control, he\u0027d held back. I appreciated that but still dreaded the inevitable.\n \"Actually,\" he said, \"no.\"\n \"No?\" I\u0027d started to take a step toward the doorway and froze.\n He laughed, though there wasn\u0027t much humor in it. \"No.\"\n \"But I just thought ... well, after last time ... You weren\u0027t very happy about the Thorn Land ...\"\n That small smile faded. \"No. And it\u0027s not like I\u0027m happy about this. But the truth is, you did find a - relatively - bloodless way to end all of this. When we were out there, you asked me what other solution could fix things. I didn\u0027t have an answer. You did. It\u0027s not great ... but it didn\u0027t kill Katrice or those other people. It didn\u0027t get you captured.\" He shrugged. \"Not ideal, no, but better than the alternatives.\"\n I leaned back against the wall, still shocked at his reaction. \"If it makes you feel better, it\u0027s not like I wanted this either. I wanted to sneak in and out and get Jasmine.\"\n He nodded, but there was a sharp look in his eyes. \"And yet, you brought the crown.\" I hadn\u0027t mentioned that to him when we first set out to the Rowan Land.\n \"Her note said she didn\u0027t believe I had it! I was hoping waving it around might do something to help us.\" He stayed quiet. \"Don\u0027t look at me like that! You can\u0027t believe I planned to use it.\"\n \"I do believe you.\" He approached me and rested his hands on my shoulders. \"And I\u0027ll help you in any way you need.\"\n Something inside my chest released, and I leaned into him, taking comfort in his warmth and the security he offered. \"Thank you. I\u0027m definitely going to need you.\"\n Kiyo pressed a kiss to my forehead. \"I\u0027m here.\"\n I felt a small smile pull at my lips, though as with his earlier laughter, I didn\u0027t really find the situation funny. \"I suppose if there is a silver lining here, maybe I can do a better job ruling the Rowan Land than she did. Some sort of greater good.\"\n To my surprise, his hold on me stiffened, and he stepped back. The smile he offered me looked tight. \"Maybe.\"\n We went back out to Jasmine, who was still riveted to the TV. The only acknowledgment we got was when I handed her the clothes, and she examined them. \"What\u0027s \u0027The Clash\u0027 mean?\"\n I ignored the blasphemy - and Kiyo\u0027s obvious amusement at my pain. \"If you want to shower, everything you\u0027ll need is in the bathroom. Towels, shampoo.\"\n That too got her attention. \"A shower ... oh, man. I\u0027ve missed showers.\"\n \"Will you two be okay?\" asked Kiyo, all signs of his earlier discomfort gone. \"I need to take care of a few things.\"\n I nodded. \"We\u0027re fine. Will you be back soon?\"\n \"As soon as I can.\" He kissed me again, this time on my lips. I must have worn another pained expression because he cupped my chin, his brown eyes full of love and compassion. \"It\u0027s going to be okay, Eugenie. Everything will be okay.\"\n I nodded once more and watched wistfully as he left. I wanted his arms around me again, to hold me and let me escape this mess. A small part of me wouldn\u0027t have minded Dorian\u0027s arms either. I sat beside Jasmine, whose attention was back on some reality show.\n \"He\u0027s running off to Maiwenn, you know.\" Her gaze didn\u0027t move. \"Off to report on what happened.\"\n My ire started to rise at her accusation, except ... I had a feeling she was right. Even if there was no more romance between them, he was still devoted to her. The recent developments were going to rock the Otherworld, and she\u0027d want the story straight from him. I wondered how she\u0027d take it; she\u0027d always feared my becoming like my father.\n \"Probably,\" I admitted. I rubbed my eyes. \"God, I\u0027m so exhausted. I feel like I could fall over.\"\n This time Jasmine turned to me. There wasn\u0027t exactly sympathy in her face, but something surprisingly close. \"No shit. You just stole a kingdom and took it over.\"\n \"It sounds so ugly when you phrase it that way.\"\n She shrugged and looked back at the TV. \"You\u0027ll probably do a better job.\" Her words echoed my earlier comment to Kiyo. \"You know,\" she added conversationally, \"everyone acts like our dad was such a bastard, like he just wanted more power. I mean, he did, but you know what Aeson told me? He said that Storm King was always talking about how he could do a better job too, that the other monarchs weren\u0027t as good. He said he was doing the people a favor.\"\n I froze, unable to respond. That was why Kiyo had reacted the way he did earlier. He\u0027d heard that about Storm King\u0027s \"good intentions,\" I realized. I\u0027d expressed exactly the same sentiment as my father.\n Jasmine didn\u0027t notice the effect of her words and instead jumped subjects in that easy, short-attention-span way of hers. \"Hey, do you think you could get Wil to come over? I want to see him.\"\n \"Sure,\" I murmured automatically. My mind was still lost in her earlier words. \"Sure.\"\n Wil was surprised to hear from me the next morning, more surprised still when I told him the reason I was calling. He said he\u0027d be over in five minutes.\n Jasmine had asked that he come alone after I\u0027d mentioned he now had a girlfriend. Still, she\u0027d been curious. \"Seriously? What\u0027s she like?\"\n I thought back to my one meeting with Wil\u0027s ladylove. Once I\u0027d banished the monsters living in their house, she hadn\u0027t shut up about conspiracy theories and assorted coverups. \"Exactly like him,\" I\u0027d replied to Jasmine.\n The reunion between brother and sister was strange. They stood there awkwardly, both staring at each other and assessing all the ways they\u0027d changed. Then, with no communication, they hugged each other. Jasmine\u0027s face was filled with legitimate emotion, and for once, Wil didn\u0027t seem like the crazy, paranoid guy he usually was.\n \"Are you okay?\" he asked her, voice trembling. \"I\u0027ve missed you so much.\"\n Jasmine swallowed, and I was pretty sure there were tears in her eyes. \"I ... I missed you too.\" And it was the truth. She\u0027d told me once she didn\u0027t care about this world - or about the half brother who\u0027d raised her. But she did. This whole time, despite her Otherworldly plans for domination, she\u0027d always loved him.\n Things grew increasingly bizarre when it became obvious the two weren\u0027t quite sure what to do with each other. Wil didn\u0027t chastise her for her absence, and at last, she simply asked if he wanted to hang out and watch TV. I think that was partly because it provided a concrete activity and partly because she\u0027d become obsessed with making up for lost TV time.\n I kept my distance but couldn\u0027t help a small, envious feeling as they sat on the couch. Jasmine leaned her head against her big brother\u0027s shoulder, and I became acutely aware of the emptiness in my own family life. I hadn\u0027t heard from my mom or Roland since getting the referral to Enrique. The closest I had to any familial connection was those goddamn kingdoms I ruled. Just as the Thorn Land had always called to me, the Rowan Land now did too, leaving such an ache within me that I practically felt nauseous. Rurik had been right. I wouldn\u0027t be able to stay away.\n But first things first. Thinking of Enrique reminded me I was due for an update. Retreating to my bedroom, I dialed his number and hoped he was up this early.\n \"Miss Markham,\" he said after just one ring. Caller ID left no surprises anymore. \"Always a delight.\"\n \"I\u0027m sure. What are you doing with the case right now?\"\n \"Nothing.\"\n \"Nothing?\" I exclaimed. Irritation rose within me. I wasn\u0027t paying him to sit around, especially after he\u0027d gotten so close.\n \"Nope,\" he said cheerfully. \"It\u0027s out of my hands. I found what I needed, proved that Deanna Jones didn\u0027t buy the gun. From what I hear, the police are searching Cal Jones\u0027s house right now and questioning him. Far be it from me to get in the way of the fine men in blue.\"\n Finally, some good news ... well, at least as the case\u0027s progress went. It wouldn\u0027t be easy on Deanna to learn the truth about her husband. \"And women,\" I said. \"There are probably women in blue there too.\"\n \"If you say so.\"\n \"Thanks, Enrique. I really appreciate it. I honestly didn\u0027t think it could be done.\"\n \"Don\u0027t get all emotional,\" he said in that brisk way of his. \"At least not until you see the bill.\"\n We disconnected. Attitude or no, Enrique had been a good call on Roland\u0027s part ... which once again brought about the sadness over the turn in my parental relationship. Well. Nothing to do for it at the moment, not with all my other problems. And anyway, I had a loose end that could now be wrapped up.\n Taking out my wand, I closed my eyes and cast a minor summoning spell, calling to Deanna. I had no control over her but she\u0027d responded to my call before - particularly since she was always on edge listening for it. After several minutes and no results, I gave up and sadly suspected she wasn\u0027t coming because she already knew the truth. As eager as she\u0027d been to get answers, it wouldn\u0027t have surprised me if she\u0027d been following Enrique around while he worked. She might have discovered for herself what her husband had done. If so, I hoped she\u0027d now move on to the Underworld and seek peace, rather than staying restless and sad in this world. There was enough suffering here already.\n I tried as hard as I could the next couple days to stay away from the Otherworld. Wil visited off and on, and Jasmine and I began doing mundane yet enjoyable activities, like seeing movies and shopping for clothes for her. Tim and Lara often appeared, still in the throes of their love, and Kiyo returned with reports about the Otherworld, reassuring me that my kingdom\u0027s control of the Rowan Land was progressing smoothly. And at night, he came to my bed, and I found the return of our fierce sex life went a long way toward taking my mind off my laundry list of problems.\n But finally, I had to give in. The call to my lands was too strong, and even Kiyo admitted that with my new and fragile hold on the Rowan Land, I needed to visit and connect with it to reinforce our bond. By that point, I needed no urging. My own body was telling me as much. I still felt weak and drained, my dreams haunted by cacti and cherry trees.\n I took Jasmine with me. Our relationship wasn\u0027t quite sound enough yet for me to leave her alone. She drew the line at going to the Rowan Land, however, insisting she would stay in the Thorn Land until my return. I had no problem with that, knowing she was secure there. Kiyo was still going with me, and Shaya caught us before we could leave.\n \"There\u0027s a few things you should probably know,\" she said uneasily. Her nervousness was likely due to the fact that I hated being troubled with the day-to-day running of a kingdom - in this case, kingdoms. Something about the fear in her eyes told me she also knew I wouldn\u0027t like what she had to say.\n I sighed. \"Go ahead.\"\n \"I ... I\u0027ve heard from King Dorian a number of times.\"\n Kiyo shifted uncomfortably beside me, and I felt that familiar prickle of anger run down my spine. All the memories of Dorian\u0027s lying and betrayal came back to me. It stung all the worse because in the end, he\u0027d gotten exactly what he wanted: the Iron Crown had done its job. He probably wanted me to take still more lands.\n \"What\u0027s he want?\" I demanded. \"The war\u0027s over. We\u0027re no longer in a partnership.\"\n \"Well, that\u0027s just it. Since you are - were - allies in the war, he says he deserves some of the spoils of your victory.\"\n \"He ... what?\" My fury increased. \"He doesn\u0027t deserve anything. I was the one who won and used the crown.\"\n She nodded, still looking like she wished she could be anywhere else. \"Yes ... but he argues that he was the one who sent you to get the crown. And that his armies lost as many lives as yours.\"\n That last point silenced me. His soldiers had fought with mine. His people\u0027s families mourned those casualties as much as mine ... and for what? To fight against a slight that had nothing to do with them, not really. I didn\u0027t owe Dorian anything, of that I was certain, but I was indebted to his subjects.\n When I didn\u0027t respond, Shaya continued. \"Some of his people are also helping hold the Rowan Land.\"\n \"Oh, are they?\" Of course Dorian would have swooped in. \"I never asked for that.\"\n She shook her head. \"Nonetheless, you need it. Many are still having trouble accepting your rule. There\u0027s a lot of seething resentment. No violence has broken out yet - but that\u0027s largely because of the sizable presence Rurik sent to keep control. Dorian\u0027s helping with that.\"\n I\u0027d meditated with the Thorn Land as soon as I\u0027d arrived, making me feel a little better, but the pressure and continued political complications were already draining me. I wasn\u0027t meant for this. \"What\u0027s he want? Half the kingdom?\"\n \"No. Trade. Tribute. The Rowan Land is a huge food producer, and he wants part of that.\"\n \"That doesn\u0027t sound so bad,\" I said tentatively.\n \"I\u0027m guessing he wants it at low, low prices,\" said Kiyo, speaking up for the first time.\n Shaya nodded. \"He does. And he\u0027s entitled to it to a certain extent. But his current demands are extreme enough that it could endanger the Rowan Land\u0027s economy. Maybe that\u0027s not an issue. It all depends on what you want for them.\"\n I thought about the refugees at the gates. What did I want for those people? I wanted them to prosper. I wanted things to return to normal. \"Can you negotiate with him to something in the middle?\" I asked Shaya.\n \"Most likely.\"\n \"Then do it.\"\n She bowed her head in acknowledgment, and I knew that\u0027s what she\u0027d already known had to be done. She was simply giving me my dues as queen, going through the motions and reminding everyone that ultimately, I still held the authority around here.\n When Kiyo and I finally made it to the Rowan Land, I felt the land\u0027s relief and welcome. Its energy burned into mine, strengthening me. At the castle, we saw little sign of the Rowan military but plenty of mine and Dorian\u0027s. They were stationed everywhere, keeping the order Shaya had told me about. They bowed low when they saw me, their actions mirrored by the kingdom\u0027s citizens. Only, Katrice\u0027s subjects didn\u0027t bow out of respect and deference. There was fear in their eyes, confusion in some, and an obvious show among a few that their actions were forced.\n Rurik was still in residence, personally overseeing the occupation. I felt secure in his control and listened as he explained what needed to be done next. I understood it only a little better than the economics Shaya had pushed on me, the main point being I\u0027d need a governing body here soon. Picking that staff would be a problem. Shaya was one in a million, but even she couldn\u0027t be in two places at once. Seeing my dismay, Rurik hesitantly added that Dorian had offered to provide people for the job. My expression at those words gave Rurik all the answer he needed.\n The Rowan Land\u0027s energy continued to flow into me when I set out to have my meditation session with it. The nature of the connection was similar to what I had with the Thorn Land, but the kingdom\u0027s feel was totally different. The Thorn Land was harsh - filled with life, yes, but life that fought fiercely against the elements for survival. The Rowan Land was softer, its life bursting forth easily and radiating through its many trees and plants.\n \"Eugenie,\" said Kiyo, following me out to a small garden behind the castle. \"Look.\"\n I paused and glanced behind me. Where I\u0027d walked, flowers had blossomed, small red ones scattered throughout the grassy path. I knelt down, inhaling their heady scent. \"Why\u0027s it happening?\"\n \"You\u0027re its ruler. You\u0027re giving the land life and energy.\"\n I thought about how being here had made me feel marginally better. \"It\u0027s strengthening me too ... but this doesn\u0027t happen in the Thorn Land. I don\u0027t have that kind of effect.\"\n \"Don\u0027t you?\" he teased, a mischievous smile on his face. \"You make it rain....\"\n A memory came to me of when the Thorn Land had floundered in drought. While connecting with the land, I\u0027d had sex with Kiyo, and the energy from that union had empowered the kingdom, breaking the dry spell and sending much-needed rain that made the people and plants flourish.\n I smiled back at him. \"Looks like we don\u0027t have to worry about that today. This land doesn\u0027t need as much help.\"\n He slipped an arm around my waist and pulled me to him, voice husky. \"But imagine the results if we did. Extra credit.\"\n Leaning down, he brought his lips to mine, his tongue pushing into my mouth with a rough passion. I felt my body answer, and for a moment, the offer was tempting. I pictured what it would be like to make love among all this greenery, here in the sunshine. Would a bed of red flowers fill the ground below us? Again ... I kind of wanted to find out, but I also wasn\u0027t comfortable in this kingdom yet. I didn\u0027t want to risk discovery of my sex life, even if it wouldn\u0027t be a big deal to the gentry. Reluctantly, I pulled away from him.\n \"Another time.\"\n After a few more protests, he let me be. I sat on the ground while he waited, closing my eyes and opening myself to the world around me. We are one, I assured the land. I am here. I felt its answer, felt warmth spread through me and lost track of time. When I finished, I was startled at how far the sun had moved across the sky. Kiyo sat on the ground cross-legged, looking at ease as he watched me.\n \"Crap,\" I said, jumping up. \"I\u0027m sorry. I didn\u0027t mean to make you wait so long.\"\n He stood as well. \"It\u0027s no problem. You needed it. You both needed it.\" I knew he was right. I was more energized, and the land felt strong and content.\n After another check with Rurik, Kiyo and I headed back to the Thorn Land. Here, he parted from me, again to \"take care of a few things.\" He assured me he\u0027d be back in Tucson as soon as he could, but I saw the look Jasmine gave me when she overheard. I could guess her thoughts: more reports to Maiwenn.\n Jasmine was impatient to go to Tucson, but before leaving, I impulsively set out alone to where I\u0027d communed earlier with the Thorn Land. It had been on a distant part of the grounds, one of my favorite places, in the shade of a mesquite tree. Its perfume rivaled that of the Rowan flowers, and around it stood cacti in all shapes and sizes, some of them small and squat and some tall and foreboding like sentries.\n Almost all of them were blooming.\n A chill ran down my spine as I stared at the flowers on the cacti. They formed a brilliantly colored perimeter, right around where I\u0027d been meditating, the petals in all shapes and sizes. The flowers were beautiful. Exquisite.\n And none of them had been there earlier. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/iron-crowned-dark-swan-3/page-19.html","bookId":2040,"book":{"id":2040,"title":"Iron Crowned (Dark Swan #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Dark Swan Series Book 3: Iron Crowned \n An embattled realm mystically entwined with our own, the Otherworld is at the mercy of one woman...Shaman-for-hire Eugenie Markham is the best at banishing entities trespassing in the mortal realm.
