{"id":109417,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"I had two immediate reactions to this. One was that Dorian could wait around forever; he had no right to demand anything of me. My other reaction was outrage that he could come traipsing into my home when I was banned from his. Admittedly, that was my own fault. I hadn\u0027t put down any hospitality rules to keep him out. As such, he\u0027d be welcomed like any other non-enemy monarch - particularly by my people. I considered simply sending Volusian to revoke hospitality but then tossed that idea aside. I\u0027d take care of this myself.\\n\\n I drove out to the gateway by my home as fast as I could without getting a ticket and then crossed over to the anchor inside my castle. Once there, I hurried through the halls, oblivious to servants\u0027 startled stares. I knew where Dorian would be. My people would have received him in the nicest chamber, the one befitting any visiting monarch.\\n\\n Sure enough. Dorian sat inside the parlor, lounging in a central chair with Shaya, Rurik, and others sitting around him. He looked like he was holding court in his own castle. My anger doubled. Everyone except him jumped up at my sudden approach, giving hasty bows.\\n\\n \"Out,\" I snapped. \"All of you. And shut the door.\"\\n\\n My words left no question about who exactly I wanted out. Dorian didn\u0027t move, but the rest scurried to obey my orders. I saw Shaya and Rurik exchange looks with each other, no doubt worried what was going to happen with the two monarchs they loved.\\n\\n Once we were alone, I turned on Dorian. \"What the hell are you doing here?\"\\n\\n He regarded me coolly, face perfectly at ease. \"Visiting, as is my right. There\u0027s nothing that says I can\u0027t. Unless you\u0027re revoking my hospitality?\"\\n\\n \"I should,\" I said, stepping forward with fists clenched. \"I should have my guards throw you out on your ass.\"\\n\\n He snorted and absentmindedly smoothed a piece of his long hair. \"Good luck with that. They\u0027d throw you out first, if I gave the order.\"\\n\\n \"So that\u0027s why you\u0027re here? To start a rebellion in my own kingdom?\"\\n\\n \"No. I\u0027m here to remind you of your responsibilities to your kingdom - since you\u0027ve clearly forgotten.\"\\n\\n \"Really?\" I crossed my arms across my chest in an effort to stop myself from doing something stupid. \"I think you\u0027ve forgotten what I\u0027ve done for my kingdom. Say, like, saving it from disaster. And risking my life for that fucking crown so that we could finally have peace.\"\\n\\n \"If memory serves, you caused that disaster when you created an inhospitable desert.\" His voice was still damnably calm. \"And that crown is doing you no good.\"\\n\\n \"Didn\u0027t you hear me? We have peace. The fighting\u0027s stopped.\"\\n\\n \"The fighting\u0027s temporarily stopped. Katrice is playing you, and you\u0027re letting her. She\u0027s dragging her feet, using this negotiation delay to figure out a way out of this. If you really want to end the war once and for all, you need to get involved and let her know you\u0027re serious. Wave the crown around. Dare her to call your bluff. Show her you\u0027re in control and stop all of this for real.\"\\n\\n I gave a harsh laugh. \"That\u0027s so typical of you. Attempting to pull the strings, as usual. You don\u0027t even have the crown, but you\u0027re telling me what to do with it.\"\\n\\n Dorian shot up from the chair, smooth features breaking into annoyance. \"I am remembering what it means to be a king. I\u0027m not running away and letting others deal with things that seem too hard.\"\\n\\n \"Right,\" I said, keeping an eye on the distance between us. \"Getting the crown was easy. Which is why, of course, you were right out there with me.\"\\n\\n He narrowed his eyes. \"You know I would have if I could. So I did the only thing I could: I got you out there after it.\"\\n\\n \"By lying!\" I exclaimed. I tried to keep my voice strong, letting anger be the only emotion to slip, but grief cracked me a little. \"By creating an elaborate set-up with Masthera in the hope I\u0027d seize more land for us. Why do you not see how wrong that was?\"\\n\\n \"Was it?\" His volume was starting to match my own. I\u0027d so rarely seen emotion seize him, and it was both terrible and beautiful. \"Do you think our people think it\u0027s wrong? The ones whose homes are no longer in danger? The ones who are alive because of this? The crown bought that, and you\u0027re going to ruin it all if you don\u0027t force her into talks! Not only that, by not acting, you\u0027re letting what Leith did to you go unpunished.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, he got punished,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Yes,\" agreed Dorian coldly. \"By me. Something you seem to have forgotten, now that you\u0027ve jumped back into bed with that animal.\"\\n\\n \"Kiyo isn\u0027t part of this. And what you did isn\u0027t enough to obligate me to stay in a relationship with someone who constantly deceives me.\"\\n\\n Dorian turned away, putting his back to me. Somehow, this was more insulting than all the glares in the world. \"I can only assume this is human logic. Achieving peace by bending the truth is deceitful. The greatest sin in the world. But infidelity is moral and just.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not! And I wasn\u0027t - I didn\u0027t cheat on you. As far as I was concerned, we were through. I was free to do whatever I wanted.\"\\n\\n \"Obviously.\"\\n\\n I didn\u0027t want to show any weakness in front of him, but the thing was, part of me still questioned if having sex with Kiyo back in the forest had been right or not. I\u0027d even felt conflicted at the time. I\u0027d let my impulses win out, using muddled logic to satisfy both my lust and need for revenge.\\n\\n \"Look,\" I said, trying to calm myself down. \"I didn\u0027t mean to hurt your feelings - \"\\n\\n He spun around so sharply that my words dropped. I didn\u0027t fear Dorian, not with my power and in my home, but something in his eyes made me step back. \"Queen Eugenie,\" he said formally. \"Don\u0027t trouble yourself over my \u0027feelings.\u0027 Replacing you in my bed isn\u0027t that difficult. You have too high an opinion of yourself in that regard.\"\\n\\n Those words slapped me in the face, despite all the reasonable parts of my brain screaming at me that it didn\u0027t matter. I had no reason to care what he did. No reason to care about him.\\n\\n \"So,\" I said, matching his tone. \"Ysabel has a place to sell her skills again.\"\\n\\n \"Very good ones,\" he agreed. \"The question now is if you\u0027re going to use yours. Put Katrice in her place. Get her to negotiate so that we can get the concessions we deserve. Stop acting like a human.\"\\n\\n \"I am human. You keep forgetting that.\"\\n\\n He studied me up and down, giving me the opportunity to do the same to him. You don\u0027t care, you don\u0027t care, I told myself, trying to push aside how much I\u0027d loved that gorgeous face.\\n\\n \"No,\" he said at last, contempt in his voice. \"It\u0027s impossible to forget. You\u0027re acting like one now, refusing to do the right thing just because I\u0027ve asked you to. You\u0027re being contrary out of spite.\" He strode toward the door. \"If you don\u0027t act soon, you\u0027ll regret it.\"\\n\\n I didn\u0027t like him being the one to end this conversation. It was more of him always having the power. \"Are you threatening me?\"\\n\\n Dorian put his hand on the door\u0027s handle and glanced at me over his shoulder. \"No. I\u0027m not the threat. Katrice is. And while you keep going on and on about how much I\u0027ve wronged you and lied to you, I can say with absolute certainty that what I\u0027ve just told you is the truth.\"\\n\\n \"Noted.\" Hastily, I made an attempt at acting like the queen around here. \"You can go now. And don\u0027t come back.\"\\n\\n That earned me a half smile, though there wasn\u0027t much humor in it. \"Are you revoking my hospitality?\"\\n\\n I hesitated. \"No. I\u0027m above that. I\u0027ll just assume you\u0027ll do the right thing and stay the hell away from me.\"\\n\\n \"Noted,\" he replied, imitating my earlier tone. He opened the door and walked away without another look. I stared at the empty space where he\u0027d been, wondering who\u0027d come out on top of that argument.\\n\\n By the time I emerged and found Shaya, Dorian had already left my castle for his own lands. She asked nothing about what had transpired with him, but worry was written all over her face.\\n\\n \"How close are we?\" I demanded. \"How close are we to sitting down with Katrice and writing up a treaty?\"\\n\\n Shaya paled, and I realized I had turned my anger at Dorian on her. \"Not as close as I\u0027d like. She agreed ... she agreed she\u0027d come in person, but only if the talks were held in the Willow Land. Queen Maiwenn has agreed, but Dor - King Dorian says that\u0027s unacceptable. He suggests the Linden Land or the Maple Land. Katrice refuses.\"\\n\\n Linden and Maple. Kingdoms both staunchly neutral. Maiwenn theoretically was too. She\u0027d always put on the pretense of friendship, and I was certain Kiyo would endorse her hospitality. But something about it made me uneasy. I didn\u0027t want to support Dorian ... but then I realized that instinct came from exactly what he\u0027d warned me of: wanting to oppose him just out of spite. Our personal mess aside, he was my ally. Neutral ground was best for us.\\n\\n \"Reiterate Dorian\u0027s stance,\" I said. \"Linden or Maple. I\u0027m going back to Tucson. Let me know what happens.\"\\n\\n Shaya opened her mouth, to protest or beg for help, I couldn\u0027t say. Dorian\u0027s words came back to me. Get actively involved. \"Wave the crown\" and make Katrice agree to our terms. No. On that, I wouldn\u0027t agree with him. I wouldn\u0027t use that crown like he wanted me too, even as a threat.\\n\\n \"That\u0027ll be all,\" I told Shaya. She nodded, obedient as always.\\n\\n The look on her face as I left made me feel a little guilty. Maybe I could make things easier for her. Maybe I could expedite all this. But for now, there was literally no harm being done. What could Katrice\u0027s stalling achieve? If she began hostilities again, she ran the risk of facing the crown she obviously feared. My people were safe. The waiting was frustrating, but it had to end soon. I\u0027d told Dorian I was human, and that\u0027s what I intended to be. I would go home, start following up on jobs, and let the gentry deal with this red tape until I was absolutely needed.\\n\\n And that was exactly what I did.\\n\\n I returned to my old life. Kiyo and I continued dating, and being with him, reestablishing our old connection and sex life, went a long way toward blocking out images of beautiful, voluptuous Ysabel in Dorian\u0027s bed. My workload increased - as did my income - though my jobs tired me out more than I was used to. That scared me. It made me think about what it meant to be human and gentry. I\u0027d fought to keep my human side dominant. Was the gentry part taking over? Stunting my shamanic abilities? No, I firmly decided. This was stress, pure and simple.\\n\\n In the two weeks that followed, though, I had to concede to my gentry side occasionally. The Thorn Land called to me, so I continued my quick visits, keeping the land strong and - no matter how much I hated to admit it - strengthening myself. Unfortunately, I took little joy from that because no good news ever came from the Otherworld. Katrice kept switching back and forth. Yes, she\u0027d agree to the Maple Land - no, she\u0027d changed her mind. Linden. But only if ambassadors went first, then the monarchs. No - she\u0027d go. But it was back to the Willow Land. Or maybe some place altogether different? What about the Palm Land?\\n\\n Dorian made no attempts at direct contact with me, but there was no need. When I went to bed each night, I could see his face. Wave the crown, wave the crown. Fortunately, my aggressive workload tired me out enough to fall asleep quickly.\\n\\n Good news of sorts finally came one day when Kiyo and I were out hiking. The temperature had shot up, heralding spring, and I\u0027d welcomed the break from work. Traipsing through the wilderness was something Dorian would certainly never do - especially in the desert. But like me, Kiyo appreciated the rugged beauty and heat of the land. I\u0027d missed these excursions with him.\\n\\n His eyebrows rose when my cell phone rang. \"You can get a signal out here?\"\\n\\n \"Apparently.\"\\n\\n I was as surprised as him. Looking at the ID, I saw Enrique\u0027s name pop up. His recent reports, after that brief surge of promising news, had been clipped and vague: simple reminders that he was still working on things.\\n\\n I answered eagerly. \"Please tell me you\u0027ve found something.\"\\n\\n \"I have,\" he said. Enrique had that smug tone from when we\u0027d met. It had been annoying then, but now, I found it encouraging. \"I finally tracked down the gun dealer and - \"\\n\\n I didn\u0027t hear the rest because a sudden drop in the temperature and tingling in the air heralded Volusian\u0027s arrival. Apparently, I could get an Otherworldly signal out here too. My minion\u0027s orders to report all urgent news trumped whatever Enrique had to say.\\n\\n \"Hey,\" I interrupted. \"I\u0027ll call you back.\"\\n\\n \"What the - \"\\n\\n I disconnected, not giving him a chance to finish his outrage. He probably wasn\u0027t used to being hung up on. I turned to Volusian, who waited patiently and silently for me. He was a spot of darkness on the sunny day; he seemed to suck away the light of the world.\\n\\n \"Please,\" I begged. \"Please tell me Katrice has finally given in, so that we can talk.\"\\n\\n Volusian stayed silent a few moments. I swear, it was for drama\u0027s sake, and I felt like choking him. \"No,\" he said. \"The Rowan Queen has not agreed to negotiations yet, although ... she has acted.\"\\n\\n Kiyo and I exchanged looks. There was no way this could be good. I was also pretty sure Volusian liked delivering this news.\\n\\n \"She\u0027s kidnapped your sister,\" he said. \"And has a list of demands to be met, if you want to see Jasmine alive again.\"\\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/iron-crowned-dark-swan-3/page-15.html","bookId":2040,"book":{"id":2040,"title":"Iron Crowned (Dark Swan #3)","description":"Storyline: Dark Swan Series Book 3: Iron Crowned \\n An embattled realm mystically entwined with our own, the Otherworld is at the mercy of one woman...Shaman-for-hire Eugenie Markham is the best at banishing entities trespassing in the mortal realm.
