{"id":109420,"no":18,"title":"Page 18","content":"It really felt like that, like I was killing a living thing. And in a way, I was. I was destroying the land\u0027s connection to Katrice. The land and its monarch are one. Kind of an esoteric concept ... but, well, the truth. I\u0027d certainly felt it in the Thorn Land. It was why I couldn\u0027t ever stay away from that kingdom for very long. It called to me. It was part of me.\n And so, I was essentially cutting a living thing in two. White-hot power burned through me as I did, the crown\u0027s magic connecting with my own and pouring into the dirt below. I had little sense of my surroundings, save Katrice screaming. Below me, in a spiritual sort of way, I could feel the land resisting at first. It didn\u0027t want to break its ties. In the end, it had no choice. The crown\u0027s magic was too strong. Seconds, minutes, hours ... I don\u0027t know how long it took, probably hardly any time at all. But suddenly, it was done. The crown\u0027s power faded from me, and the land lay there open and unclaimed. Raw and wounded.\n As the magic\u0027s haze wore off, the rest of the world slowly shifted back into focus for me. I stared around at the gaping faces and at Katrice, huddled and sobbing. I thought she\u0027d aged before, but it was nothing compared to now. Being ripped from the land had devastated her. Her dark hair was almost all gray now, her face gaunt and lined.\n And all around ... all around, the land was restless. I could feel its energy, calling out ... reaching out ... yearning for a new master. Hardly any of the people gathered showed any recognition of this. They were still watching the drama of me and Katrice. A few spectators had puzzled looks on their faces, as though they too could hear the land.\n It was because they were powerful enough to take it, I realized. The land was already seeking those who possessed the strength to join with it, and looking up, I saw from Cassius\u0027s face that he could sense that. Katrice\u0027s son hadn\u0027t had the power to claim a kingdom, but her nephew did.\n So, for my next impulsive act of the day, I stuck my free hand into the ground. Just like the last time, soil that started off hard and ungiving soon grew soft and warm. My hand sank into the earth, and I was welcomed, as though someone were clasping my hand in return. Warmth filled my body, a comforting warmth very different from the crown\u0027s searing heat. I closed my eyes, striving to stay with that connection, to show I was worthy. Part of me was already given over to the Thorn Land. I had to fight to claim this land as well.\n Then, I felt it.... I felt the land accept me. And as it did, the ground began to shake. At first, I thought it was just some aftereffect of the magic, but then I remembered what had happened when the Thorn Land had bound itself to me. The land took on the form that spoke to my soul, that was natural and right to me. Aeson\u0027s former kingdom had shaped itself into the Sonora Desert, the land of my birth. The Rowan Land was trying to do the same thing.\n No, no! Not again. A semi-tropical kingdom transforming into a desert had wreaked havoc on its residents. We\u0027d faced starvation, drought, poverty.... It was only recently that the kingdom had gotten on its feet again, becoming prosperous and self-sustaining. I wouldn\u0027t go through that again. Frantically, I tried to think of some other form. But what? I hardly ever left the southwestern United States. A quick image of the Catalina mountains flashed into my mind, the slopes snowy and pine-covered like the day Kiyo and I had fought the demon. I could feel the land start to grip that picture, and I yanked it away. This kingdom had some small mountains, but that was a tiny percentage of its terrain. I couldn\u0027t turn this place into Switzerland or Nepal.\n Stay the same, stay the same, I begged the land. For the sake of its occupants, I needed the landscape to remain unchanged. It was difficult, though. The land wanted to bond to me, to what was ingrained within my soul. Thinking back to the journey here, I tried to picture the rows and rows of cherry trees along the road. I remembered the sun shining through other deciduous trees and flowers growing in clusters. I thought about the stretch of rowan trees. Stay the same, stay the same.\n Gradually, the earth around me began to slow its shaking and finally stop - except for one spot. Not far from where I rested my hand, the ground cracked open and leaves and branches burst through. I scurried back, watching in as much awe as I had the first time a magical tree burst forth, growing and unfurling its leaves to full-size in seconds. I held my breath, wondering what it would be, this tree that dictated my new kingdom\u0027s nature.\n It was ... a rowan tree.\n I wasn\u0027t the only one who thought this was weird. \"Didn\u0027t you claim it?\" asked Jasmine, puzzled. I rose to my feet beside her, brushing dust off of my jeans.\n \"I ...\" Had I? That was a rowan tree, making this - by all Otherworldly reasoning - the Rowan Land. Which is what it had been already. Maybe it hadn\u0027t worked. Maybe the crown hadn\u0027t done what I expected it to. Maybe Katrice had won it back somehow.\n But, no. There it was. I felt it. The land. The earth. The rocks. Every leaf and flower. The scents, the colors ... they were all sharper and more intense. If I opened myself up, I could feel every single piece of this land. It hummed. It buzzed. The energy was dizzying, and I forced myself to shut it out for a moment.\n \"No,\" I told Jasmine, wonderingly. \"It\u0027s mine.\" I stared at the rowan tree, more perfect than any real one could be, its orange-colored berries bright against green leaves swaying in the breeze. I reached out and stroked one of the leaves, vaguely aware of Katrice still sobbing. A tingle of power ran through me. \"It\u0027s still the Rowan Land ... except, it\u0027s my Rowan Land.\"\n Things were a little awkward after that.\n The soldiers were no longer trying to imprison me, but they also weren\u0027t ready to jump at my every order. My companions were of little use. Imanuelle, per her nature, was content to sit back and watch the mess I\u0027d stumbled into. Kiyo wore a disapproving look on his face, and I feared I\u0027d have a lecture coming later. Jasmine still seemed to be in shock. The only time she came to life was when I debated what to do with Katrice and Cassius. Unsurprisingly, Jasmine\u0027s suggestion was to kill them.\n \"Confine them to her rooms,\" I ordered, hoping someone would obey me. \"Guard them with ...\"\n I was kind of at a loss. Theoretically, gentry knew how this worked. Whoever controlled the land ruled, but I wasn\u0027t entirely sure the guards around here would be so keen about imprisoning the woman who had ruled them ten minutes ago. Volusian, I thought. Now that I was in control, I could summon him without fear. Then, I realized I needed him for more important things. I looked pleadingly at Kiyo, needing no words.\n He nodded. \"I\u0027ll watch them.\" He turned abruptly, urging the former royalty inside with a couple of guards who\u0027d decided to get on board with me right away. Kiyo being on guard served two purposes. I could trust him to do a good job - and, the longer he did, the longer I was safe from his disapproval.\n I then spoke the words to bring Volusian to me, the sight of him further frightening those who already watched me with terror. I\u0027d let the storm dissipate, but darkness still seemed to wrap around my minion as his red eyes assessed me, the Iron Crown, and the tree.\n \"Unexpected,\" he said.\n \"Go to Rurik,\" I told him. \"Explain what happened and have him bring an occupying force here immediately.\" I didn\u0027t know what that meant exactly, but I did know military control took precedence here if we were going to secure the land. Rurik would know what to do. Governing would come later. \"And then ...\" Now I hesitated. \"Have Shaya contact Dorian about what happened. Then return to me.\"\n Volusian paused, waiting for anything else I might add. When nothing more came, he vanished, and the sun seemed to shine a little brighter. It was all a waiting game now, and I glanced around at the Rowan Land\u0027s still-stunned residents.\n \"Well ... that\u0027s it. Carry on as usual. Guard the gates. No one leaves. And you ... go get your soup or ... whatever you\u0027re eating.\" That was for the civilians. When no one moved, I hardened my expression and repeated my orders more loudly. Fear flashed across the Rowan citizens\u0027 faces, and they sprang into action.\n This inner courtyard was huge, and I spotted an unoccupied spot near some carts that must have delivered supplies earlier. I walked over to them, Jasmine following, and sat on the ground. It was a weird spot for a queen, I supposed, but I wanted to rest while waiting for Rurik. Plus, it still let me keep an eye on this delicate and dangerous situation. The bulk of the guards were out here, and I didn\u0027t think mutiny was out of the question yet. People were moving after my commands, but it was mostly to gather in anxious clusters and discuss what had happened.\n Jasmine sighed and leaned her head back against the wall. \"I want to go home,\" she said.\n \"We will. As soon as Rurik gets here, we\u0027ll head back to the castle and let him deal with this.\"\n \"No.\" Her voice was small. \"My other home. The human world.\"\n I turned to her in astonishment, dragging my gaze from some peasants who were begging the guards to let them out. \"What? But you hate that world. You always said this is where you fit in.\"\n \"It is,\" she agreed. \"But I just want ... I want to get away from all this for a little while. From magic. And castles. And ... whatever. I want to watch TV. I maybe want to see Wil. I want to charge my iPod. And my playlist doesn\u0027t suck.\"\n I couldn\u0027t help a laugh. \"I kind of want all those things too. We\u0027ll go soon. We\u0027ll ... we\u0027ll cut those chains. I-I\u0027m sorry I don\u0027t have the key with me.\"\n She shrugged. \"It\u0027s fine.\"\n \"Kiyo\u0027s going to be upset about all this,\" I murmured, surprised to be confiding in her.\n \"You did the right thing,\" Jasmine said. \"I mean, aside from not killing Katrice and Cassius. But you can still do that.\"\n Any residual smile left on my lips vanished. \"Cassius ...\"\n \"They were lying,\" she said bluntly. \"He didn\u0027t do anything.\"\n \"Jasmine ...\"\n \"I\u0027m serious.\" She looked at me, her blue-gray gaze level and steady. \"He talked a lot of talk when he came to see me ... touched me a little. But that was it. I think they just wanted to scare me.\"\n She didn\u0027t elaborate on the touching. I didn\u0027t ask. I was just relieved she hadn\u0027t gone through what I had. \"I\u0027m sorry,\" I told her. \"I\u0027m sorry I didn\u0027t protect you better.\"\n Now she smiled. \"You did fine. And hey, you ended the war, right? You won.\"\n I turned away, staring off into space. \"I guess I did.\"\n We didn\u0027t talk much after that. I was tired, exhausted from all the magic. Apparently, using an ancient, powerful artifact wasn\u0027t as easy as it seemed. Neither was proving your dominance over a large piece of land. I\u0027d felt wiped out last time but had gotten out of the Thorn Land as quickly as possible. Now, sitting here, I was stuck in the Rowan Land, still acutely aware of its every sensation. That intensity would fade, just as it had with the Thorn Land, but for now, it was like a hammer banging inside my head, demanding attention.\n I practically flew to the gate when Rurik arrived. Once admitted, he and the force behind him paused. Studying the situation, he had a reaction similar to Volusian\u0027s.\n \"Really?\"\n \"Things happened kind of fast,\" I admitted.\n \"It was well done. Possessing this land was a much better idea than simply defeating Katrice in battle.\"\n I scowled. \"Well, can you possess it for now?\"\n He grinned. \"Gladly.\"\n Turning from me, he fixed a hard gaze on those gathered. \"You\u0027re all now subjects of Queen Eugenie, daughter of Tirigan Storm King,\" he barked. \"Kneel.\"\n I looked on imperiously as they obeyed. I knew this was necessary to establish our control. No weakness, no hesitation. We were conquerors. I\u0027d long since taken off the Iron Crown but wished I\u0027d brought my normal one of authority. Oh, well. It wasn\u0027t like I could\u0027ve foreseen this when packing.\n Everyone in the keep fell to their knees, heads bowed. We let them stay like that for several seconds while my stomach sank. Finally, they were allowed to rise, and Rurik kicked into full martial law mode, demanding an assessment of all soldiers and issuing rules for servants and refugees. He had a few tasks for me - more actions that made me seem queenly - before finally declaring I could leave.\n \"I\u0027ll sort out the immediate problems,\" he told me in a low voice. My own soldiers were now out and about, establishing order. \"We\u0027ll lock this place down, start scouting the immediate area, sifting out those who can be trusted.\" He paused eloquently. \"I\u0027ll probably have to throw a large part of their military into the dungeon.\"\n \"Do what you have to do,\" I said. I had a feeling he\u0027d eventually want to talk executions but was holding back for now. I imagined I looked as tired as I felt.\n \"And you simply want to imprison the former queen for now?\" he asked.\n \"For now.\"\n Jasmine scoffed beside me, and Rurik\u0027s expression showed he shared her opinion.\n \"Well, don\u0027t stay away long,\" he said. \"You need to make your presence felt. And you need to connect with the land.\"\n \"I know, I know,\" I grumbled. I\u0027d avoided the Thorn Land before, but it had kept calling me back. \"I know how this works.\"\n He arched an eyebrow, that sardonic smile of his returning. \"Do you? Do you know what\u0027s happened?\"\n I threw my hands up, gesturing around. \"I got stuck with another kingdom.\"\n \"Do you know how many other monarchs control more than one kingdom?\"\n I shook my head, presuming whoever did must live far from me.\n \"No one,\" said Rurik.\n \"I ... What? No.\" Dorian had mentioned conquering more than one land, making me think it must happen now and then. The Iron Crown\u0027s purpose suggested as much. \"There must be someone else.\"\n \"No one,\" Rurik repeated. \"You\u0027re the only one. The only one in ages ... well, except for Storm King.\"\n The world swayed around me again. I once more just wanted to go somewhere and lie down. My reaction brought a bigger smile to Rurik\u0027s face, but I swore there was a little sympathy in his eyes too.\n \"Congratulations,\" he said. \"Congratulations, Eugenie - Queen of Rowan and Thorn.\"\n \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/iron-crowned-dark-swan-3/page-18.html","bookId":2040,"book":{"id":2040,"title":"Iron Crowned (Dark Swan #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Dark Swan Series Book 3: Iron Crowned \n An embattled realm mystically entwined with our own, the Otherworld is at the mercy of one woman...Shaman-for-hire Eugenie Markham is the best at banishing entities trespassing in the mortal realm.
