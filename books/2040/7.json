{"id":109409,"no":7,"title":"Page 7","content":"I signed the tax return and left a check before heading out. It figured: I owed. Self-employed people always owe. It was a credit to Lara that she\u0027d managed my books well enough that the amount was low, but after seeing her run off with my roommate, I decided it was a good thing our working relationship didn\u0027t include performance reviews.\\n\\n She\u0027d also left me a jam-packed day, which turned out to be beneficial. A busy schedule kept my mind off Dorian (mostly) and what was transpiring in the Otherworld. I fought with ferocity, as though each ghost or monster I battled was Katrice herself. It was the drives in between that were the roughest on me. There was no action then. Just my own thoughts.\\n\\n My last job of the day was the most difficult, undoubtedly scheduled that way on purpose so that I didn\u0027t walk into the little ones tired and injured. True, I was feeling weary, but concern for Dorian kept a spike of adrenaline burning through me, one that I knew would get me through this last job. Yet, walking up to the client\u0027s house, I couldn\u0027t stop asking the same questions in my mind. Why hasn\u0027t Volusian reported to me yet? Isn\u0027t the fight over?\\n\\n A nervous-looking young woman answered the door, introducing herself as Jenna. She was the one who had made the call, though it wasn\u0027t exactly on her own behalf.\\n\\n \"She\u0027s in the living room,\" Jenna whispered to me, letting me inside the foyer. Her eyes were wide with fear. \"Just sitting there. Staring.\"\\n\\n \"Does she speak?\" I asked. \"Does she answer your questions?\"\\n\\n \"Yes ... but ... it\u0027s not her. I know that doesn\u0027t make sense, but it\u0027s not. The people at work think she\u0027s just gone crazy. I\u0027m pretty much the only one who still talks to her. She\u0027s about to lose her job, but ...\" Jenna shook her head. \"I swear, it\u0027s just not her.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re right.\" I held my wand in my left hand and my silver athame in the right.\\n\\n \"Is she ...\" Jenna\u0027s voice dropped even lower. \"Is she possessed?\"\\n\\n \"Not exactly.\" Lara had warned me about this one. It had initially sounded like possession, but further data suggested otherwise, unfortunately. A possession would have been easier. \"It\u0027s a fetch. It\u0027s like ... I don\u0027t know. Her double. Kind of.\"\\n\\n \"Then ... what happened to Regan?\"\\n\\n I hesitated. \"I don\u0027t know.\" I didn\u0027t want to tell Jenna there was a strong possibility that Regan was dead. That was the usual fate for a fetch\u0027s victim. Of course, fetches usually left once they\u0027d sucked all the energy and goodness from someone\u0027s life. If this one was still here, the odds of Regan still being alive were marginally higher. \"If ... er, when we find her, she may be in bad shape.\"\\n\\n I stared off down the hallway, where I could hear the sound of a TV in the living room. I shifted my grip on my weapons and prepared myself.\\n\\n \"What should I do?\" asked Jenna.\\n\\n \"Wait outside. Don\u0027t come back inside until I tell you to - no matter what.\"\\n\\n Once she was safely away, I set off down the hall. There, in the living room, I found a woman sitting perfectly straight on the couch, her hands folded neatly upon her lap as she stared at the TV. There was a blankness in her brown eyes that told me she wasn\u0027t really watching. She didn\u0027t even acknowledge my arrival. Glancing around the living room, I took in its space and features, assessing them for a fight. I also noticed a couple pictures on the wall, group shots with Jenna and a smiling brunette who looked exactly like the woman on the couch. Yet, glancing between them, I knew Jenna was right. This wasn\u0027t Regan.\\n\\n \"Where\u0027s Regan?\" I asked.\\n\\n The fetch didn\u0027t look at me. \"I am Regan.\"\\n\\n \"Where\u0027s Regan?\" I repeated harshly. \"What have you done with her?\" Please, please let her be alive.\\n\\n This time, the fetch turned her head, those cold eyes taking me and my weapons in. \"I told you. I am Regan.\"\\n\\n I had a moment\u0027s debate on what to do. Killing the fetch without learning Regan\u0027s location would make the next part of this job even more difficult. Yet, as the fetch continued staring at me, I knew she\u0027d recognized what I was and what threat I represented. I had to take her out now, banking on the fact that fetches usually kept their victims close.\\n\\n I held out my wand and began chanting the words that would drive this creature back to the Otherworld. It was where fetches came from, and a forceful enough banishing was usually enough to deter them from returning. I\u0027d only have to get the Underworld involved if she decided to -\\n\\n She attacked.\\n\\n The fetch didn\u0027t transform into her true shape as she sprang at me. Rather, she turned into something in the middle. She still wore Regan\u0027s face, but it had a sickly green hue. Her eyes were bigger and darker and looked like they\u0027d been stretched out. Her hands and feet were bigger too - and clawed.\\n\\n She came at me with her full strength, knocking me into a wall mercifully free of furniture. I kneed her in the stomach, needing to get distance between me and the claws trying to rake my face and neck. She fell back a little, not much, but enough to give me more maneuvering room. I swung out with the silver blade, and she recoiled. Iron could inflict lethal blows on the gentry, but silver was the metal of choice for almost any other creature.\\n\\n \"Tell me where Regan is,\" I said, advancing forward. \"Tell me, and I\u0027ll simply banish you back to the Otherworld. Make this difficult, and you die.\" I was managing that balance I always did: weapon ready to attack while part of my mind focused on a connection to the Otherworld. Hecate\u0027s tattoo, a snake on my upper arm, began to tingle.\\n\\n The fetch decided I wasn\u0027t a full threat yet and rushed me again. I dodged this time, anticipating her movements based on the last attack. A fetch might be able to replicate someone, but their fighting style was mostly brute force. My athame caught her arm as I moved, and she snarled in pain, showing fangs that dripped with green saliva. It hurt her but didn\u0027t slow her down as she lunged back at me. I sidestepped her again but overlooked what was behind me, hitting painfully against a cabinet.\\n\\n I winced, and she pressed her advantage, swinging those claws at me. I barely escaped them, managing to squirm away and hurry to the other side of the room. A banishing, I decided. I\u0027d just keep my distance and do a banishing. I just needed a couple minutes - and to stay alive. I began chanting words to send her from this world, words that didn\u0027t have to follow any ancient form so long as my power and intent were clear. She paused briefly, realizing what I was doing, and seemed to consider her options.\\n\\n A circle. I should have put a circle of protection around the house. There was a very real possibility she might try to flee. That and killing me were pretty much her only options. The former would probably be easier for her - and would release Regan. But I didn\u0027t want this fetch freely walking the world. I needed to send her on.\\n\\n Power surged in me and through me, out to the wand and toward her. This was her last chance to run - or, as it turned out, throw a coffee table at me.\\n\\n I admit, I didn\u0027t see that coming - literally or figuratively. I should have, though. Furniture, props, whatever ... they were all fair game in a fight. The fetch had no reason to rely simply on hand-to-hand combat, and my athame gave her good reason to attack from a distance. The coffee table was a simple one, a smooth circle of glass on iron legs. A wood-framed one would have been better. The frame would have slowed the spread of glass. This table had nothing to stop it, except me. I tried to jump out of its way, saving my head and face. I wasn\u0027t far enough away when it hit the wall and shattered, though. Stinging, burning pain went through my back and left arm as glass scraped and - no doubt - embedded itself in my flesh.\\n\\n My sense of self-preservation kept me moving through the pain, but my connection to the Otherworld had shattered with the glass. The fetch knew this and leaped forward, risking the athame in the hope I was too addled and injured from the glass to stop her.\\n\\n I wasn\u0027t. I had never let go of my weapons, and my athame was ready and waiting when she came. I plunged it into her heart and started the banishing again. Over the years, as I\u0027d grown in power and spent so much time in the Otherworld myself, these banishings had become easier. Not easy, but easier. There was a time when I couldn\u0027t have held a fetch off with my athame while simultaneously attempting a quick banishing.\\n\\n But now, the power flowed through me as the fetch pulled herself off my blade. She had no time to react, attack, or flee. The magic seized her, and she disappeared before my eyes, fading into sparkles and then nothing. I didn\u0027t know the extent of the athame\u0027s damage. I might have just sent her back to die. Or, she might survive and come after me in the Otherworld as some creatures tried. I wasn\u0027t worried. My abilities stayed consistent in both worlds, but my magic was a bit stronger over there - especially in the Thorn Land.\\n\\n I took a deep breath of relief and stuck the weapons back in my belt as I hurried toward the front door. Jenna was sitting on the lawn, face pale with worry. She sprang up when she saw me.\\n\\n \"What happened? Is she okay?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not sure,\" I said, wiping sweat off my brow. My hand came away red with blood. \"We have to find her. Does she have a basement?\"\\n\\n \"No.\" Jenna followed me inside and then halted. \"Oh my God ... your back ...\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s nothing. I\u0027ll deal with it later.\"\\n\\n \"At least - \" She reached toward a spot between my upper arm and shoulder blade, wincing as she did. I yelped in pain and watched as she pulled away a huge piece of jagged glass. \"That\u0027s bleeding ... really bad ...\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m in better shape than Regan,\" I said brusquely, trying to ignore both pain and the sight of my blood all over the shard she\u0027d taken. \"No basement. Closets? Attic?\"\\n\\n \"Both.\"\\n\\n We checked the closets with no luck, and Jenna stuck her head in the attic\u0027s tiny space. Still nothing.\\n\\n \"Shit,\" I said. I shouldn\u0027t have let the fetch go without getting Regan\u0027s location. What if Regan wasn\u0027t nearby? What if the fetch had broken habit and hidden her victim far from home?\\n\\n Jenna looked as defeated as I felt, then her head shot up. \"The shed. There\u0027s a shed out back.\"\\n\\n We were out the back door in a flash, jerking open the door to a little garden shed that was mercifully unlocked. There, curled up on the ground in a fetal position, was Regan. Jenna let out a strangled cry, and we both dropped to the ground. Jenna propped Regan up while I gently shook her.\\n\\n \"Regan, Regan. Wake up. Please wake up.\"\\n\\n For a few moments, I feared the worst. Then, Regan\u0027s eyes fluttered open, her expression frightened and confused. Her breathing came in short rasps, and she futilely tried to sit up on her own. Her failure didn\u0027t surprise me. When a fetch took over someone\u0027s life, it put its double into a sort of magic coma. It required no ropes or gags, simply leaving behind a silent and immobile victim. Regan\u0027s ability to wake up verified that the fetch was gone, but the woman had spent days without food, water, or using her muscles.\\n\\n \"She\u0027s dehydrated,\" I said. Studying Regan\u0027s state, I knew this was beyond a few glasses of water. \"Let\u0027s get her to the hospital.\"\\n\\n Jenna drove, with Regan laid out carefully across the backseat. She said little, only making the occasional moan. Meanwhile, in the passenger seat, I attempted to clean myself off with baby wipes and to pull glass bits out of my back. The blood on my face was cleaned off when we reached the ER, as was most from my body, but I didn\u0027t want to answer questions about what had happened to me. I borrowed Jenna\u0027s jean jacket, figuring the few scratches on my face weren\u0027t enough to attract attention.\\n\\n We told the staff that Regan had been depressed and starving herself. We went on about how we hadn\u0027t seen her for days and had only just found her tonight. Since there was no ostensible bruising or signs of binding, they took us at our word and hurried to hook her up to fluids. We\u0027d also probably landed her in therapy, but that was of little concern now.\\n\\n I waited with Jenna just outside Regan\u0027s room as a nurse finished attaching the appropriate tubes and a doctor performed further examination. When they were done, they told us we could go in and that Regan would recover once her body had sustenance again. I had no intention of going with Jenna. Now that Regan was safe, my plan was to get a taxi back to my car and go home to clean up before an Otherworldly jump. Lara could bill these women later.\\n\\n \"Wait,\" said Jenna, as the doctor and nurse were about to leave. \"My friend\u0027s hurt. She broke a window to get in Regan\u0027s house and got cut.\"\\n\\n I shook my head. \"No, really, I\u0027m fine - \"\\n\\n I shut my mouth when I followed everyone\u0027s gaze. Even I could see that the left sleeve of the jacket was soaked with blood. There was little argument to make after that. Jenna stayed with Regan, and I was ushered off to a cubicle in the ER. The nurse shut the curtain, and I took off my shirt. The doctor\u0027s eyebrows rose.\\n\\n \"You broke a window? With what, your entire body?\" He called for another nurse, who began assisting the other with glass removal and sanitizing.\\n\\n \"I threw a rock,\" I said. \"It didn\u0027t make a very big hole, but I didn\u0027t have time to make it bigger. I just had to get to Regan.\"\\n\\n \"Noble,\" said the doctor, whose attention was on the larger shoulder gash. \"If stupid.\"\\n\\n Someone with a better understanding of physics might have realized my injuries didn\u0027t quite line up with what I\u0027d get crawling through a jagged hole in a window. Fortunately, this group\u0027s talents were elsewhere. The myriad scratches and cuts were dealt with by bandages and painful antiseptics. The big cut required a fair number of stitches.\\n\\n I was restless the whole time, wanting only to get back and see what had happened to Dorian. The medical staff was thorough in its work, however. I decided I should just be grateful that they were letting me go and not forcing a longer stay. I was the walking wounded, in bad shape but not in life-threatening danger.\\n\\n \"Here,\" said the doctor, just before letting me go. He scrawled out a prescription and handed it to me, along with reams of paper on wound care and cleaning. \"Antibiotics. Get it filled tonight.\"\\n\\n \"I will,\" I said glibly.\\n\\n He gave me a warning look. \"I mean it. I know your type. You think you\u0027re invincible, but any of that could get infected. Get the prescription. Clean and change the bandages on the cuts.\"\\n\\n He was right that I thought I was invincible. I\u0027d had stitches and wounds before, my gentry blood usually expediting the healing. But I nodded meekly, promising I\u0027d obey.\\n\\n \"Good,\" he said, following me out to the waiting room. \"Follow up with your family doctor in a week. I think your ride\u0027s over there.\"\\n\\n \"My ride ...?\"\\n\\n I stared around the room, freezing when I saw a familiar face. \"Mom?\"\\n\\n She\u0027d been leaning against a wall, eyes anxiously studying everyone in the room. Spotting me, she practically ran over, staring at my bandages in alarm. I had no coat, and the tank top showed my battle wounds. \"Eugenie! Are you okay? What have you done now?\"\\n\\n For some reason, that made the doctor snort a laugh before walking away. \"I\u0027m fine,\" I told her automatically. \"What are you doing here?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m your emergency contact. And that is not fine.\"\\n\\n I was still stunned to see her. It felt like it had been so long. Ages. \"It is now,\" I said dazedly. \"All patched up. And I\u0027ve got all this ... stuff.\" I waved my stack of paper around.\\n\\n She brushed dark hair from her face, her expression both weary and distraught as we headed for her car. \"It never gets easier. Not with you, not with him.\"\\n\\n I gave her a sidelong look. \"Does he know you\u0027re here?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" she said, getting out her keys. \"Not that it would matter if he did. Nothing could have stopped me from coming when they called me. I thought ... Well, I never know what to think....\"\\n\\n I couldn\u0027t look at her as I sat gingerly in the car. My eyes were filling with tears. I\u0027d missed her so much. I\u0027d missed her, well, momness. Lots of people cared about me, but it wasn\u0027t the same. Plus, I felt horrible, horrible that I made her worry. And because of me, Roland was out endangering himself again too.\\n\\n I hastily ran a hand over my eyes and turned to her as we pulled out of the parking lot. \"When did you get glasses?\" I asked in surprise. Delicate wire frames rested on a face very similar to mine. It was our coloring that was different. My red hair and violet eyes had come from Storm King.\\n\\n \"A few weeks ago. They\u0027re just for night driving.\"\\n\\n I looked away, fearing the tears would return. Glasses. Such a stupid thing. There was a time, though, when I would have known every little detail of her life. There was so much distance between us now. My churning, guilty thoughts only came to a standstill when she turned into a pharmacy a few blocks from the hospital.\\n\\n \"Mom, no! I have to get back to my car and - \"\\n\\n \"You can go back to endangering your life again soon enough. Here, let me see those.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not my usual pharmacy,\" I said petulantly.\\n\\n She was skimming the wound care instructions. \"Yes, well, I\u0027m sure this one still has a couple bandages stashed away somewhere.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re such a mom.\"\\n\\n She glanced up, a small twinkle in her eyes that reminded me of how things used to be between us. \"I\u0027m your mom.\"\\n\\n I followed her sullenly as we waited for the prescription, and she forced me to get a basketful of gauze, bandages, and other first aid supplies. I already owned a lot of them, but she wouldn\u0027t rest easy until she actually saw them in my hands.\\n\\n \"I really appreciate you coming,\" I admitted as we waited. \"It ... it\u0027s good to see you.\"\\n\\n Her expression softened. \"It\u0027s good to see you too, baby. I\u0027ve missed you.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t suppose Roland\u0027s forgiven me?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s more complicated than that,\" she told me. \"He still loves you. Really. But he\u0027s worried. And he doesn\u0027t like you being over ... there. Neither do I.\"\\n\\n I averted my eyes again. I knew she didn\u0027t - and she had good reason. My conception was the result of her captivity and rape in the Otherworld. She\u0027d spent years keeping that knowledge from me, hoping to protect me from both my heritage and the agony she believed that place caused.\\n\\n \"Well, that\u0027s complicated too. I have to be there, Mom. I know you guys don\u0027t approve, but there are people counting on me. They\u0027re not all like you think. I can\u0027t let them down. They\u0027re ... they\u0027re dying because of me.\"\\n\\n \"Is there a man involved?\"\\n\\n I considered a flippant remark, then chose honesty. \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"The obvious problem aside ... would I like him?\"\\n\\n I tried to picture my mom meeting Dorian and couldn\u0027t stop a small smile. \"Probably not.\"\\n\\n \"Do you ever talk to Kiyo anymore?\"\\n\\n I looked up sharply, my smile fading. \"It\u0027s over with us. He let me down. You know that. This other guy ... he won\u0027t.\"\\n\\n I was saved from further conversation when my name was finally called. I added the prescription to my portable hospital bag and felt grateful that my mom didn\u0027t pursue the topic of my love life anymore. I was equally grateful when she drove me back to Regan\u0027s house. It wouldn\u0027t have surprised me if she\u0027d left me carless in Tim\u0027s care.\\n\\n Leaving my mom stirred conflicting feelings in me. After missing her so much, part of me just wanted to stay and gaze at her, to drink in those features I loved so much. I wanted her to hold me, to be my mom and take care of everything. And yet ... always, always, the Otherworld was pressing on me. I didn\u0027t have the luxury of being a little girl right now. I didn\u0027t have the luxury of being her daughter.\\n\\n \"Thank you,\" I said, giving her as careful a hug as we could manage. \"Thank you for ... I don\u0027t know. Everything.\"\\n\\n She held me for a few moments and then pressed a kiss to my forehead. \"There\u0027s nothing to thank me for. Just be careful.\" She broke from the embrace. \"Do what the doctor says. And for God\u0027s sake, don\u0027t end up there again. I don\u0027t want another call.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll try,\" I said. This made us both smile, largely because we knew my trying to stay out of harm\u0027s way was pretty futile. \"And tell Roland ...\" I couldn\u0027t finish, but she nodded.\\n\\n \"I know.\"\\n\\n I left her then, loading my loot into my own car and driving home. Regan didn\u0027t live too far from me, only about ten minutes. The time flew by. I had so many things to think about that when I arrived at my house, I hardly knew how I\u0027d gotten there. Tim\u0027s car was parked out front - as was Lara\u0027s. I dragged myself out of my own self-pitying miasma, uneasily wondering what I\u0027d find inside. Seeing the two of them naked on my kitchen table would not be cool.\\n\\n Instead, they were cuddled up on the living room couch, watching a movie. All seemed innocent, but some vibe made me suspect they hadn\u0027t been actually watching too much of it. I shook my head in exasperation.\\n\\n \"How is this my life?\" I muttered, setting my bag on the counter.\\n\\n \"Did you say something?\" called Tim. The living room and kitchen were mostly open to each other. He muted the film.\\n\\n \"Nothing important.\"\\n\\n \"We figured you\u0027d be out for the night,\" he said. I was pretty sure there was an accusatory tone in his voice.\\n\\n I opened the cupboards, rummaging for food. I was suddenly starving. \"Well, rest easy. I\u0027ll be gone soon enough, right after I get dinner.\"\\n\\n Lara turned and peered over the couch\u0027s back. \"Pop-Tarts aren\u0027t - oh my God! What happened to you?\" Tim noticed my bandages now too. He didn\u0027t look as shocked as her - he saw me come home after fights a lot - but worry had replaced his snark.\\n\\n \"What have you been doing?\"\\n\\n \"Earning the mortgage.\" I put two blueberry Pop-Tarts in the toaster. \"Isn\u0027t that what you told me to do?\"\\n\\n \"Jesus, Eug. I didn\u0027t - \"\\n\\n \"Forget it,\" I told him. \"Everything\u0027s fine. But you\u0027re going to have to send a bill to Jenna Benson, Lara. I wasn\u0027t able to collect.\"\\n\\n Lara nodded without a word, still aghast at seeing what my real life looked like. I poured some water and choked down one of the antibiotics while waiting for the Pop-Tarts. As soon as they were done, I retreated to my room, eating quickly as I threw together an overnight bag. While I was packing, my eyes lingered on a half-finished puzzle on my desk. I sighed. How long ago had I started that one? A month ago? I loved jigsaw puzzles. I used to do one a night.\\n\\n I was almost finished packing - I even included the first aid supplies, thanks to some residual mom-guilt - when the temperature dropped. An unsettling yet familiar presence filled the room, and soon Volusian appeared before me. I nearly dropped the bag.\\n\\n \"Mistress,\" he said with a mock bow. \"I\u0027ve come to report on the battle.\"\\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/iron-crowned-dark-swan-3/page-7.html","bookId":2040,"book":{"id":2040,"title":"Iron Crowned (Dark Swan #3)","description":"Storyline: Dark Swan Series Book 3: Iron Crowned \\n An embattled realm mystically entwined with our own, the Otherworld is at the mercy of one woman...Shaman-for-hire Eugenie Markham is the best at banishing entities trespassing in the mortal realm.
