I\u0027ve never felt so safe in all my life.\" He points with his free hand and I notice we are still holding hands, \"I know a quiet place down the road. Very clean. Owner has OCD, so the service is slow but the place is immaculate.\" \"Okay.\" The warmth of his hand is nice. It makes the lonely go away. He\u0027s the cure. I sigh. Quietly. He pulls me into pace with him. \"So is it as bad as Howie Mandel\u0027s?\" I snort, \"It\u0027s not what you think. I\u0027m not a germaphobe.\" He looks confused, \"You are so.\" I shake my head, \"I don’t do it because I care about the germs. I was raised to be clean.\" I don’t tell him that I\u0027ve spent my lifetime trying to clean something up. He makes a face, \"Oh, those scary cult families where you get scrubbed with boiling water like Mommy Dearest?\" I laugh, \"Something like that.\" The similarities are disturbing. He shrugs, \"My uncle Frank is a surgeon. I get it. He went through a vodka phase once. He had bottles of it in every bathroom and we had to wash our hands with it.\" He steals a glance down at me, \"The crowds are hard too. New Mexico is probably pretty quiet. Boston\u0027s not exactly quiet.\" \"What kind of surgeon.\" We need to talk about him. \"Orthopedic.\" \"Wow.\" He doesn’t sound interested, \"Yeah.\" \"You taking medicine then? Keeping it in the family?\" He looks down at me laughing like I\u0027m missing something, \"No.\" His eyes are filled with a touch of something intense, but it\u0027s too far beneath the surface for me to see it. \"I\u0027m in business. What about you?\" \"Journalism is what I want to do. I ran the paper at my high school. We did a lot of earth sciences pieces. Trying to be proactive about the environment. But I\u0027m a freshman, so we\u0027ll see.\" The Town Car pulls up as we round a corner. Stuart climbs out of the car he parks illegally, \"You said you were going to Chicken Lou\u0027s.\" He looks pissed. His dark eyes are stormy. Shell is right, he\u0027s hot. Especially angry. Yowza. I don’t want to explain the car or the driver to Sebastian. I scowl and shout across the street like a psycho, \"Go home! I thought you were on a date!\" \"Had to end it early.\" He\u0027s speaking through his teeth. I roll my eyes, \"The chicken place was too busy. Huge crowd.\" I pray he gets it without me having to explain. Sebastian looks down at me, \"Is that your driver?\" I laugh. It\u0027s nervous and I shake my head, \"No. God no. Stuart, this is Sebastian. Stuart is a friend of my…uhm…family\u0027s. He\u0027s like a big…older…annoying brother.\" Stuart looks less than impressed. Sebastian smiles uncomfortably, \"Hey man. We\u0027re gonna eat here. You wanna come?\" Stuart ignores him, \"This is a bad idea.\" \"I\u0027ll call him. Now go away.\" I turn and pull Sebastian to the door. I almost grab the handle but my hand freezes looking at it. Thankfully, Sebastian grabs it quickly, \"Let me. Is everything okay?\" I look back at Stuart and nod. \"He\u0027s really over protective.\" \"Who are you going to call?\" \"My…uhm…family.\" I laugh inside my mind. I\u0027ve never said the word uhm so many times in my life. Stuart doesn\u0027t get in the car. He watches. He always watches. It\u0027s creepy. He isn’t creepy, but his job is. My phone vibrates the minute we get inside. I ignore it. The restaurant smells great and I can see the sparkle and shine in every corner. The servers are clean, with their hair pulled back and greased to their heads. Everything is white linen and immaculate. I almost sigh relief, but then I notice how everyone else is dressed. We look like slobs. I look down at my chipped toenail polish and ugly blue sandals and grimace. He must have seen the look in my eyes because he leans in and whispers, \"Yeah, I forgot how fancy this place was. You okay here?\" I nod, \"I\u0027m starving. I don’t care. I feel like an idiot but whatever.\" \"Me too.\" We are still holding hands. It\u0027s weird for me to hold hands with anyone. After my panic attack it\u0027s nice. More than nice. He\u0027s like a hero. I feel rescued. The right way. Like he is a prince and not a dictator. My knight in shining armor. He cured the lonely. Chapter Three \"We ate and talked and ate some more. He eats a ton like me, so that’s good. I didn’t look like a pig.\" I\u0027m nattering. It’s a first. Shell rolls her eyes, as she applies my toenail polish, \"I don’t know how you eat that much and don\u0027t get fat.\" \"Sprints. But yeah, we ate and talked. He is so sweet. He never tried to kiss me or tried to touch me, except the hand and that was after he did the sani. I super liked him.\" I\u0027m gushing. She scowls up at me, \"One date and you\u0027re in love? I told you to have dinner. You girls are all the same. You hold out and the first boy you let in you love him. You need to test drive this shit and date a few others. This is too fast.\" Her tone is edgy. It hurts a little. \"It was just dinner.\" I\u0027m getting angry. \"Are you going out with him again?\" I feel my face tightening, \"No. I don’t know. He doesn’t have my number. You\u0027re the one who made me go. Why are you being a whore about me liking him? You know how big of a deal this is to me? He saw the lonely and he stayed.\" Seeing the look on my face, she lightens hers. \"Sorry. Oh my god, I am being a bitch. Sorry dude. I\u0027m so happy for you. This is a huge step. I\u0027m just so annoyed with your Uncle Daddy Dude. He called like a hundred times when we were out. He was pissed Stuart was on his own time. It was like eight at night. Like come on. You know?\" I nod, \"Sorry.\" I\u0027m still mad. She laughs and blows her dark hair out of her tanned face, \"No. It\u0027s not your fault. I should have known better than to fall for your Uncle Daddy\u0027s driver.\" I laugh too. \"He isn’t my Uncle Daddy.\" She makes air quotation marks, \"Your benefactor.\" It makes me feel weird when we talk about him. I don’t like it either. I wish I had a mom and a dad and a normal life. I wish my clothes and hair smelled like food and not bleach and anxiety. She hurts me and she doesn’t know it. It\u0027s not her hurting me though. It\u0027s me reacting. So I keep my face pleasant. Until I feel it start. The room wobbles a bit and the polish bottles almost duplicate in numbers. They surround me. Each one has been touched. I swallow, looking at them all. \"I see you.\" She says, but doesn’t look at me. \"No, you don’t.\" I whisper. \"Just do it.\" She says it like it\u0027s nothing. I reach over and grab the wipes and the polish remover and all the little polish bottles she\u0027s touched. I feel sick wiping her off of everything that’s hers. I feel sicker that she\u0027s okay with it. She changes the subject back to my dinner, \"So, he saved you and then bought you a dinner at an OCD restaurant. This guy is the real deal of sweet and romantic. He never even tried anything?\" I\u0027m almost disappointed when I say it, \"No.\" \"Wish he had?\" Her glossy lips turn up into a grin. I grin, \"No.\" I don’t sound convincing. She laughs, \"Stuart tried. Oh my god that man is hot. No shirt and it\u0027s like wow. Wow. So beautiful.\" \"He\u0027s a ninja.\" She arches an eyebrow and then looks back down at her work, \"For real?\" I look at my toes and beam, \"Thanks. Yeah, for real. He\u0027s like a badass ninja. He told me he was anyway. I mean he could be lying. But I think he kinda looks like a ninja, ya know?\" I flick her, \"And not because he\u0027s from Wichita, crazy-ass, racist woman.\" She sticks her tongue out, \"Are Japanese people even ninjas?\" I furrow my brow, \"He told you, he\u0027s not Japanese. He\u0027s from Kansas.\" She wrinkles her nose in a cute sort of way, \"I know. Have you heard him talk all twangy? It\u0027s so hot. I love him.\" I shake my head and lie back on my bed, waiting for my toes to dry. \"You\u0027re a dork.\" \"I\u0027m a horny dork, Em. I needs me some ninja loving. You mind if I go get it on? You promise you\u0027ll be okay?\" I look at the ceiling and laugh, \"Yeah. I got Netflix today for the Xbox that you called a need and not a want. I\u0027ll watch that.\" My stomach hurts as soon as she says it, but I can\u0027t expect her to spend her entire year locked in here with me. She jumps up and runs out the door, \"Love you smoochie.\" My phone vibrates. I sigh, and pick it up. \"Hi.\" I answer. \"You don’t go to restaurants with boys you don’t clear with me first.\" His tone is harsher than normal. Not so quiet. \"I didn’t. You knew what I was doing.\" His voice echoes a bit, \"Don\u0027t play games with me. You won\u0027t win. You specifically told me you were going to a chicken place and never went there.\" I swallow, \"I\u0027m sorry. I should have called and told you we were changing places. I just…well…I had an attack and had to leave the first place.\" His voice softens, \"Are you okay?\" I don’t know why I feel so able to talk to him. Maybe because I never see him. \"No. I had it right in front of him. It was humiliating.\" \"I\u0027ll call the doc. She\u0027ll want to see you.\" I hate that. I hate that he goes for the doc. He never wants to talk to me. Even when I let him in and give him something, he shuts me down. He pushes me away. \"Whatever.\" I say. \"Don\u0027t say that. It\u0027s rude.\" I don’t say anything. He clears his throat, \"If you\u0027re going to date and Stuart is dating the ever lovely Miss Monkton, then the rules are changing. You will not date on the same evening.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-lonely-the-lonely-1/page-4.html","bookId":1888,"book":{"id":1888,"title":"The Lonely (The Lonely #1)","description":"Storyline: The Lonely (The Lonely #1) 19+ The truth is subjective to what the lonely lets in.
