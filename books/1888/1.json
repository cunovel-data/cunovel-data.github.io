{"id":84726,"no":1,"title":"Page 1","content":"Chapter One\\n\\n The front steps of any building you\u0027ve never been in before, always feel intimidating and seem larger than they really are. The entrance and steps to Speare Hall had felt full of inspiration and excitement the first time I saw them. The stairs were intimidating and exciting.\\n\\n Orientation cured that feeling.\\n\\n The cinderblock cell-like room was not what I expected. I expected romance and creativity and downtown Boston. I never expected blazing heat, lack of air conditioning, humidity and a general sense of sterility. I looked around that first day for the cameras and guards. I assumed I was on the set of the remake of 1984. Surely Big Brother was watching me.\\n\\n Now, months later, I still can\u0027t seem to get back that initial inspiration and excitement as I cross the threshold to start the year. I am stuck in the sterility and 1984.\\n\\n The school is alive with people and energy, but the building is strange and smells like prison. I know about the industrial smell of prison, all too well.\\n\\n My excitement about being a freshman is long gone. Instead, I\u0027m climbing the stairs, gripping to my belongings and trying not to make eye contact. I don’t want my fellow students to see it. See the fact I don’t belong there, with them.\\n\\n I glance at my watch and count the minutes until my saving grace arrives. I wish we\u0027d managed to get flights together. But we did not and so I am stuck with the responsibility of walking through the front door of our room alone.\\n\\n I enter the grey dank room and dump my crap on the bed. The mattress is frightening with its plastic cover and the wooden desk in the corner is old and industrial looking. Everything about the small room is functional and wipe-able.\\n\\n I do like that, it feels like home.\\n\\n The floor is shiny like a hospital and the walls are white and stark. They close in around me. I almost bolt from the room, leaving my things and running the entire way home. The entire two thousand miles home.\\n\\n Instead, I close my eyes and let Dr. Bradley\u0027s words fill my head. \u0027Deep breaths in and out. Eyes closed. Body numb. You\u0027re at the beach and the sand is soft. The waves are small and make little noise. Slowly come back to the room you are in. Let the light of the room feel like it\u0027s blessing you. You are safe. You are grateful for the safety and the air and the roof over your head.\u0027\\n\\n I open my eyes and try desperately to let the light of the wide window bless me.\\n\\n My heart is slowing and my mouth isn\u0027t as dry.\\n\\n I\u0027ve grown fond of Dr. Bradley\u0027s affirmations.\\n\\n I look around and decide to focus on the room instead of my insanity. The room is blank. I need things, which means I need him.\\n\\n I hate needing him. I dread sending him texts asking for things, but I don’t have any other way of buying things. Besides, he wants us in as much contact as possible. It\u0027s his rule. Well, one of them.\\n\\n I pull my phone out and sigh.\\n\\n \u0027Can I go to the store?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why do you insist on asking? Of course you may go to the store. I told you about this already. What do you need?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Bedding and stuff. Remember I asked you before?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Right, but I told you to stop asking. I gave you the account. Spend it how you want. The car will be there in 20.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027KK.\u0027 I don’t mean it. I won\u0027t ever use the account without asking first. I don’t like the fact he gives me money. It won\u0027t ever feel like it\u0027s mine.\\n\\n \u0027KK is a typo, not a send off. Please speak like an adult\u0027 He\u0027s so snarky.\\n\\n I sigh, and look around the room. I can\u0027t unpack anything. I just can\u0027t. I need everything there to be able to do it and I feel like I have nothing. No control. No peace. The room isn\u0027t clean, not like it should be.\\n\\n I don\u0027t move. I just stand there and take it all in. I can\u0027t sit on the bed or touch anything. I never realized how bad it would be. The new place syndrome is almost physically painful.\\n\\n I grab the wipes from the bag I carried up and I start.\\n\\n It\u0027s a frenzy when it starts. OCD isn\u0027t just a sickness, it\u0027s a way of life. I should have gone to school to be in forensics, instead of wanting to be in journalism. I\u0027m sweating and moving in a way that would frighten a normal person. Fortunately, the person who walks through the door understands. Her green eyes lift. They\u0027re not surprised at the state of me, at all.\\n\\n \"Em, did you do my side already?\" Her voice is dripping with sarcasm when she asks.\\n\\n I glance back at her, snapping out of my attack mode. I stop moving and look around. I barely remember entering the room. The room that now glistens far more than it did before.\\n\\n \"You know his car is sitting at the curb. His hottie, naughty driver saw me and asked if you were ever coming down.\"\\n\\n It takes me a second to come back to the real world. I put the used wipe in the bin and dump pumpkin-spice hand sanitizer in my palm. She watches my face as she dumps her bags down on the shiny mattress, which no doubt reeks of bleach.\\n\\n I frown at the plastic mattress and our few belongings, \"Don’t unpack. Let\u0027s go to the store first. I forgot I asked him to let me get bedding.\"\\n\\n She shrugs, \"K.\"\\n\\n When we leave, I lock the door and walk away from the unfinished job. It\u0027s a step in the right direction for me to leave something before I\u0027ve finished it. It will plague me, but at least I\u0027ve done it.\\n\\n His driver is playing with his phone when we walk up. He raises an eyebrow at me when I open the door. He jumps out and grabs it. I don’t notice the way the people stare at the man in the black suit opening my door, or the fact I am leaving in a black Lincoln Town Car. I do notice the way Shell beams and tosses her hair about.\\n\\n \"Try not to be too obvious.\" I whisper, as Stuart gets into the front seat.\\n\\n \"He\u0027s just so hot.\" She leans in and whispers back. Her lips smell like berry gloss. She always smells nice. Sometimes her clothes smell like food her mom cooked. That’s my favorite. At least it was when we were in New Mexico. Now she smells like me. Lost smells of the many airports and taxi\u0027s we\u0027ve been in.\\n\\n Stuart watches her in the rearview. I don’t blame him. I doubted my hetero-ness until I realized I wasn’t attracted to her, but attracted to the smell and the feel of her. Her clothes are always soft from fabric softener and her hair smells like garlicky Italian food. Her green eyes sparkle in a way I love, in a sisterly sort of way.\\n\\n I want my eyes to sparkle like hers. I want my lips to glisten and smell like lipgloss. I want long, shiny dark-chestnut hair and a long, lean body. I want to be her most days. I\u0027m not entirely sure if I\u0027m her friend because I like her, or if it\u0027s that I want to be her?\\n\\n Her nails are always long and polished. Her lips stick out from her face just enough that you can\u0027t help but want to kiss them. Even as a girl, I always wanted to kiss them. We tried it once. It felt wrong in my soul, but I liked the feel of her berry gloss against my mouth. Well, for all of six seconds. Then I needed it off of me.\\n\\n She flutters her eyelashes at me, \"You think he\u0027d go out with me?\"\\n\\n I almost laugh at the question, \"Do bears poop in the woods?\"\\n\\n Stuart looks at us in the rearview, \"They do and I\u0027ll pick you up from dorms tomorrow night at seven.\" He grins. I can\u0027t fight the grin that crosses my lips seeing his.\\n\\n Her face flushes, \"Okay.\"\\n\\n She is ballsy. She always has been ballsy.\\n\\n \"You like Chinese?\" Stuart is barely watching the road. It doesn\u0027t make me nervous like it should. He\u0027s an excellent driver.\\n\\n Shell wrinkles her nose, \"No. I like everything but. You\u0027re not Chinese are you?\"\\n\\n He snorts. \"I\u0027m American. Born in Wichita, but my grandma was Japanese. I\u0027m a quarter I guess.\" His Kansas accent is so obvious it isn’t even funny. Not to mention, he only slightly looks like he might have a touch of something exotic in his bloodline. He looks like every other Heinz 57 American. Only he manages to look exactly like an Abercrombie model while doing it. I give her a horrified look.\\n\\n She grins, \"I love Japanese food.\" I am dying inside.\\n\\n \"I know a place.\" He doesn’t seem to mind she is insanely rude.\\n\\n I sit in the awkward silence of their rearview mirror planned date and try to think of things to say. My filter denies every one of them. There is no recovering from the humiliation flamed across my cheeks.\\n\\n He pulls up in front of the outlet store.\\n\\n \"Thanks Stuart.\" I say and grab the handle, but he\u0027s out of the car lightning fast and opening the door.\\n\\n \"I can get it.\"\\n\\n He looks unimpressed, \"I can get fired.\" His tone mimics my own.\\n\\n I nod, \"Sorry.\"\\n\\n He shakes his head and climbs back in.\\n\\n I elbow Shell on the way into the store, \"Ass. Don’t date his driver and don\u0027t ask people what nationality they are. It\u0027s embarrassing. He\u0027s born in Wichita. He sounds like he\u0027s from Kansas. You\u0027re a moron.\"\\n\\n She isn’t fazed, \"He\u0027s nummy hot and I get to see him naked tomorrow. I don’t care if he\u0027s related to me. It\u0027s on.\" She smiles her disgustingly naughty grin.\\n\\n She pushes the cart and puts things we need in. I put them back. \"I don’t want to spend too much.\" She rolls her eyes and puts them back in.\\n\\n She snatches my phone from me and texts from it. I try to get it back but it rings. She passes me the phone with a smug grin.\\n\\n \"Hi.\" I say weakly.\\n\\n His voice is quiet but he still manages to be shitty, as always. \"Buy whatever you want.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m buying what I need.\" I\u0027m getting defensive.\\n\\n He sighs, \"Either buy the nice stuff or I will have the entire store delivered to the dorms. Better yet, I will order it all from some store no one but Paris Hilton can afford. You will be the most popular girl in dorms with your fancy espresso maker and fabulous couches.\" He sounds weird being so deadpan and saying fabulous.\\n\\n \"Whatever.\" My face is glowing red. I shudder imaging the other students in my room.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve asked that you not say that word. It\u0027s annoying.\" I hear the flipping of pages or a book in the background. He\u0027s working and I\u0027m his annoyance.\\n\\n \"We done?\" I ask saucily but he\u0027s already gone. I look at her and frown, \"You shouldn’t do that. He doesn’t even want you to have my cell number, let alone touching it.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-lonely-the-lonely-1/page-1.html","bookId":1888,"book":{"id":1888,"title":"The Lonely (The Lonely #1)","description":"Storyline: The Lonely (The Lonely #1) \\n 19+ \\n The truth is subjective to what the lonely lets in. \\n Emalyn Spicer has lived with it for a long time.
