{"id":84730,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"I frown, \"What if we have a date the same night?\" \"Then he cancels his. You will remain in the dorms if he and Miss Monkton are out. Are we clear?\" \"Yup.\" \"Yup, is piss poor English. Goodnight, sweet dreams.\" He has never said that before. He was shitty like he always is, but he\u0027s never said sweet dreams before. He hangs up like always and I just stare at the phone. Shell doesn’t come home. I don’t sleep. I don\u0027t sleep much on a regular bases, but the first night in a new place is always the worst. It\u0027s a guarantee that I won\u0027t sleep. It\u0027s what I call the lonely. It creeps up whenever I\u0027m uncomfortable. It freezes me up. I feel it enter new places with me, like it\u0027s in the bag I packed. The broken bits of whatever it is inside of me, the lack of trust maybe, have never healed. Nineteen years of life, almost twenty, and I can\u0027t get past it. It\u0027s part of who I am. The difference between it and the phobias is the lonely is genuine. It\u0027s been part of me always. The phobias were learned over time. My phone vibrates, as I\u0027m lost in self-pity. I glance at it, \u0027Go to sleep.\u0027 I look at the phone, grinning. He always knows. I look around the room, wondering. How does he do it? How does he know? Maybe he is Big Brother and I am in 1984. When I pick up the phone I can\u0027t believe it\u0027s three am. I text back smirking, \u0027You first.\u0027 \u0027I am sleeping.\u0027 I snort. He is making jokes now? My fingers almost tremble with anticipation and fear as I text my response, \u0027What are you dreaming about?\u0027 \u0027You.\u0027 My heart skips a beat. I have a fantasy. I can\u0027t lie. It\u0027s a deep dark fantasy that I never let myself see. It mostly involves him being a Duke or a Baron who is bent on helping me, but like the Phantom of the Opera. He\u0027s troubled and wants to do anything to be there for me. He wants me. I think it\u0027s a common dream with orphans. Not to mention we are forced to watch more nun-themed movies than the average American. Like the Sound of Music. I hold the phone and get a wicked grin as I text him back. \u0027What am I doing? In your dream?\u0027 He might be a baron or a duke. He might also be that guy who sleeps with his dead mother in the motel movie. I shiver and push that thought away. \u0027Sleeping and not annoying the living hell out of me.\u0027 My heart hurts. \u0027Night.\u0027 is the last message I receive. I leave it at that. I turn the phone off even though I\u0027m not supposed. It\u0027s one of his rules. I hate that I have to obey him, even when he\u0027s shitty to me. I hate needing him. I hate that he really is the only chance I have at a real future. Instead of ending up as a waitress in New Mexico. I stare at the ceiling and then try pacing. I watch another movie and then when I can\u0027t keep my eyes open a second longer, I do it. I turn off the TV and close my eyes. Let myself relax and try, just try, to sleep. It creeps in and hugs me, wraps me in fears and doubts. I remain there until the sun comes up, frozen. I\u0027m grateful we arrived a week early. I can\u0027t imagine trying to go to school as exhausted as I am. My eyes are crusty and my throat is dry, when she bounds through the door with a smile that is unmistakable. I\u0027m grateful to see her. She is my saving grace. \"Oh my god, Em. He is A-MAZE-ZING.\" She thumps her back against the door and sighs. Her red face and dirty grin speak volumes. My eyes won\u0027t stay open. I mutter, \"The lonely.\" And pass out. I wake as the sun is going down. She is gone again. I yawn and stretch and turn the phone on. I climb out of bed and check underneath them both and in the closets. The phone vibrates, undoubtedly, with the messages he sent me while it was off. He\u0027s more than likely pissed I turned it off. I ignore it and take my things to the showers. I\u0027m taking a tiny stand for my dignity. I\u0027m mid shampoo when the shower curtain is ripped back, making me scream. My eyes open wide, getting only a flash of Michelle\u0027s stressed out face and then close tight, taking loads of soap in. I cry out from the burning behind my eyelids, \"Shit, Shell. My eyes. They\u0027re burning. Ass.\" I pull the curtain closed. My face is on fire and my eyes are burning. \"Hurry up. He\u0027s going to come and get you if you don’t answer that phone.\" She sounds panicked. \"Seriously, Stuart just texted me. Uncle Daddy Weirdo is pissed. He\u0027s fuming.\" \"You think he\u0027s fuming.\" I grumble. I open my eyes under the water, but nothing is stopping the burning. I blink and bat them, but it still hurts. I wrench back the curtain and cuss some more under my breath. I pull on my robe and stomp across the bathroom in my rubber shower shoes. I leave my shoes next to the door just inside the room, as always and slip on my bedroom slippers. I am so angry I could spit flames. If I had the slightest spark, I would have flames shooting from my nostrils. I wish I did have flames. I could use them to blow torch things and sanitize like the kosher chefs do on TV. I grab the phone off the bed and dial the number. He answers in a rage, \"YOU EVER TURN THAT DAMN PHONE OFF AGAIN AND I WILL COME AND GET YOU. NO MATTER WHERE YOU ARE! DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?\" His voice sounds so different I hardly recognize him. I wince, dropping the phone. I don’t cry for other people. I don’t cry unless I\u0027m in pain, horrid amounts of physical pain. I refuse to allow myself the weakness of the tears forming in my eyes. I blink them back. I shake, looking down. I take a breath and pick up the phone. He speaks softly after I hold it to my face for a minute, \"I\u0027m sorry. I\u0027m sorry. I was wrong to shout like that. You scared me. I have to know where you are.\" Again his voice is so altered, I almost don’t know it. He is genuinely sorry. I can hear it. It doesn’t change the fact I am still genuinely terrified. I don’t speak. I cannot. \"I can hear you breathing. I know you’re upset. Close your eyes. Just like Doctor Bradley says. Close them and find the peace and gratitude.\" He tries to talk soothingly but he can\u0027t. He isn’t a soothing person. \"You\u0027re an asshole.\" I whisper. My eyes pop open when I realize what I\u0027ve said. He laughs into the phone. \"Don\u0027t turn it off again, okay?\" \"Whatever.\" He sighs, \"Come on. Work with me here. It\u0027s all for your benefit.\" \"Whatever.\" I\u0027m angry. I never get angry. \"You mad?\" \"Yup.\" \"Good.\" He hangs up. I put the phone down. A text comes in instantly, \u0027Ignore the bad messages, the early in the morning ones. Got a bit desperate.\u0027 I ignore them all. Including the ones my eyes are reading out of habit. I glance up at Shell. She bites her lip, \"He gets so crazy. I\u0027m scared of him. He phoned Stuart\u0027s phone and screamed like a psycho. Maybe you should call the cops.\" I sigh, and look at her sideways, \"And say what? I have a mysterious benefactor who insists on reaching me and keeping me safe? And then whine that in return, I have to suffer through his bad temper, lack of social skills and incessant need to have my cell phone on. The cell phone he gave me, for free. Along with the fact he\u0027s paid for everything for you and I.\" She crosses her arms, \"Sometimes he\u0027s a bastard, dude. A nasty-bastard. He\u0027s always watching you. It\u0027s creepy. We can go home anytime, you know that right?\" I shake my head, \"No, he isn’t. He\u0027s like a dad or a big brother. He worries and overreacts. It\u0027s scary when he does it, but it\u0027s all in the name of keeping me safe. I went on a date with a stranger and then was unreachable. Your dad would be pissed if we were back home in Clovis. Besides, I don’t want to go back. Clovis isn’t my home.\" It never was. She concedes, \"Okay.\" I distract her, \"How was your date?\" She beams again, \"Oh my god. Oh my god. It was…oh my GAWD.\" I roll my eyes. \"Glad one of us has some oh my god going on.\" She flashes me a grim look, \"Pretty hard to have any oh my god when you hose every boy within a five-foot radius with seasonally-scented hand sani. You never let anyone close enough.\" I point, \"I also don\u0027t have any STD\u0027s, pregnancy scares, or guys who won\u0027t stop calling. And smelling like pumpkin-spice is a nice way to spend the day.\" She rolls her eyes, \"True dat. So we going out? You put me in charge of the New Leaf foundation here at University and I think this is an excellent way to start it off. I heard there is a bar around that is fun with a capital T for trouble.\" I laugh, but she doesn’t change her desperate expression. She pleads, \"New Leaf? I was kidding about the T for Trouble. It\u0027s called Taboo. Supposed to be fun. The T is for Taboo. Okay, maybe a tiny bit of trouble. We can go somewhere else more mellow.\" Her voice rises with hope and sweetness. I roll my eyes, \"I don’t do clubs.\" \"You\u0027ll have fun.\" I look at her, astonished she actually said that. \"Please, try to have fun.\" Her attack is a pout and a soft smile. \"I don’t want to go.\" \"If you hate it we never have to go again.\" I cross my arms over my robe and tilt my head, \"If I have a panic attack?\" \"We can come home right away. I\u0027ll pack extra sani\u0027s and your paper bag.\" I sigh. She pleads and bats her eyelashes, \"We can\u0027t drink. We\u0027re minors and not on the Mexican border. All we can do is dance and maybe score a bit of ecstasy if we\u0027re lucky enough to find some.\" I nearly stroke. I glower, \"No. No drugs or I don’t go.\" My brain is screaming because I don’t want to go and somehow she has made me agree to it. She jumps off the bed, grabbing my hands and hopping in an excited circle. I\u0027m pretty sure I\u0027ve just been had. She threw the drugs in to get me to agree and then was fine with the drugs leaving the table. We change into club clothes, for me this is a t-shirt and jeans and strappy sandals but minus the running watch. I\u0027m feeling bold. I laugh at myself in my head, but a thought about how crazy people laugh inside their heads floats through. So I stop and look at myself in the mirror, the new mirror Stuart installed.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-lonely-the-lonely-1/page-5.html","bookId":1888,"book":{"id":1888,"title":"The Lonely (The Lonely #1)","description":"Storyline: The Lonely (The Lonely #1) 19+ The truth is subjective to what the lonely lets in.
