Chapter Twenty-One I finish proofing my essay and click save. I close my laptop and sit in the feelings I\u0027m having. I don’t have a decision made. I don’t have a choice I want more than the other. But I\u0027m not dating both. So I will wait it out. I nod at myself, like a crazy woman. I\u0027ve spent the entire day avoiding Sebastian\u0027s attempts at getting me to come over. I know what he wants and I don’t know if I can do it. Not so soon after doing it with Eli. I\u0027m not like Shell. I pick up my phone, it\u0027s vibrated non-stop. There are tons of messages and voicemails. Sebastian has my number now. I gave it to him without Eli\u0027s permission. I\u0027m a rebel. The newest text is from Eli. \u0027Meet me now.\u0027 Instead of giving the request thought, I get up, pull on my coat and run down the stairs. When I cross the street, to where Stuart stands outside the SUV, I notice he looks different. Less of everything, confidence, life, energy, and even muscle mass. His lean gorgeous glow is replaced with something sad and empty. The snow falls on our heads. The sounds surrounding us are plenty but it feels like I can hear the snow falling in our little world, where it\u0027s just he and I on the sidewalk. I touch his coat sleeve and smile. \"She\u0027s trying to make you jealous. That says something. If she didn’t want you jealous, she wouldn’t be flaunting him about.\" His eyes flinch, \"I just messed up so bad. I should have told her about it. I should have just made her more than him.\" I shake my head, \"It was authentic with her being scared. She is a terrible actress. Terrible. I would have seen through her act. I wouldn’t have feared for my life and felt like I lost everything.\" He looks me in the eyes, showing me his pain. \"I am so sorry. I swear I will never do that again.\" I shake my head, \"It worked. Do you know how hard it was to live with the lonely? Everyday was the biggest disappointment. Everyday those eyes haunted me but I couldn’t place them. The curtain in my mind was more like a steel wall. You saved me, Stuart. And she will come around when she sees that.\" He opens the door, \"Thanks.\" I lean in on my tiptoes and kiss his cheek, \"Thank you. You always will be the hands in the dark that saved me from the lonely.\" I climb in and wait. He drives us in silence. My jaw clenches seeing Eli\u0027s building. My palms are sweating but when he opens the door I climb out. My body works against me. It\u0027s on autopilot. It wants him, more than anything. I cross to the foyer, slowly and press the button. When the doors open he\u0027s standing inside. He holds a hand out of the elevator doors. I put my hand in his. He squeezes and pulls me inside. The doors close. The silence is thick and painful. \"I\u0027m sorry.\" He says, maybe to me, maybe to the elevator. I don’t look at him. I look at our bizarre reflections in the brushed metal. I smile remembering what it looked like when were crawling all over each other. The elevator dings and he pulls me inside. He walks me to the living room, I guarantee no one ever sits in but me. He doesn’t let go. He sits and drags me with him. We sit on the dark-burgundy leather in silence. It doesn’t feel like empty silence. It\u0027s filled with all the things we won\u0027t ever say to each other. We don’t talk like normal people. Normal couples. There will never be anything normal between us. I glance at the snow on my boots and frown, \"I should take my shoes off.\" \"No.\" He says it brusquely. I flinch. He sighs and speaks. Still not looking at me. \"What do you want?\" I turn and face him, adjusting how I sit so I can see him. He looks different. I don’t have an answer. I just pray he speaks again so I don’t have to. \"What do you want, Sarah?\" I shake my head, \"What do you mean?\" My voice is timid and small. My stomach is in my throat. \"I mean in life, in general. What do you want?\" I think he\u0027s about to say he won\u0027t spank me anymore. He won\u0027t touch me anymore. His grip on my hand is firm and intense. I want us so close we are like one person again. I want his skin against mine. \"I want you.\" I whisper. It\u0027s ballsy and I\u0027ve never been ballsy. He nods, \"You want the things I can offer? You can live without the others?\" My mind halts, the others? Does he mean the wishes I made a thousand times for normalcy? The normal I have craved for so long? Can I live without it? \"No. I want both.\" I need to choose me. He shakes his head, \"There\u0027s no both. There\u0027s what\u0027s here and what\u0027s out there.\" \"Why do you want me? You have all that stuff down that hallway for a reason. You have all those things for a reason. You obviously didn’t get them to be with me. You\u0027ve had them for a while. I doubt you\u0027re in desperate need of girls to submit to you.\" I don’t mention the fact his capabilities, as a lover are outstanding and intense, like a roller coaster would be. A grin plays with his lips, \"It\u0027s not something I care to discuss or explain.\" I hate his walls. I jerk my hand away. He flexes his, like he\u0027s letting blood back in after gripping mine so hard. I stand up, \"Well then, I guess we\u0027re done with this. Why don’t you call the doc for me?\" I stomp away. I push the elevator button. I hear him get up. He wants me angry. He wants me to play along. He wants me to get pissed and end up bent over his dirty fucking bed. I am angry, but not in the way that he wants. I\u0027m sick of him. I tap the button like always. He\u0027s standing behind me. I can feel the heat of him towering over me. He\u0027s going to rush me into the elevator and strip my clothes off. I\u0027m shaking with fury that\u0027s so close to the surface, my blood is bubbling. My fists are clenched. The elevator comes. I take a deep breath and step in. I turn and face him. He doesn’t move. \"Why did you even want me to come over?\" I ask and hold the door. I don’t know why I\u0027m bothering, but he\u0027s making me so angry. His eyes flicker, \"I followed you and watched you last night. You were having fun and being free and you looked normal. I wanted to see it up close.\" I step back and let the doors close. His hands shoots in and stops the door. My skin crawls. His face is hard and smug like the man in the chair. \"I want you to pick me.\" My back is pressed against the cold steel wall, \"And live a half life?\" His eyes flicker. He\u0027s getting angry. He looks like a monster. \"I can give you everything.\" I grip the steel shelf that left bruises on my butt and thighs. \"Except the one thing I want. I want you. Can you give me yourself the way I\u0027ve been able to give myself? I don\u0027t have any dark corners left. You\u0027ve invaded them all.\" \"I want to be enough for you. I want it too.\" He pulls his hand back and the elevator closes. I could cry on the floor. I know he would come and get me. He would hold me and comfort me. In some ways, he needs me to be that weak girl who needs him to protect her. I storm across the foyer and out into the cold wind and snow. \"Dr. Bradley\u0027s, please.\" I mutter and climb inside the SUV. He drives and lets me stew. He doesn’t speak. I\u0027m grateful. I jump out, almost running for her building. I\u0027m near tears when I open the door and tap the shit out of the elevator button. I feel like something is chasing me, and if the elevator doesn’t get there, it will get me. The door opens. She\u0027s inside. She looks confused but trying to be pleasant. \"Sarah?\" I jump inside and take huge breaths. I didn’t realize I was holding my breath. \"Are you feeling alright?\" I shake my head, \"I need you.\" I\u0027ve never said those words before. We ride up to her office and I hustle into my chair. I slump in it and then I\u0027m up. I\u0027m pacing. \"He has me driven insane. He wants to be with me but then he won\u0027t let me in. He won\u0027t be with me. He\u0027ll have sex with me.\" I pause and look at her, \"No. He\u0027ll fuck me. He\u0027ll fuck me and make me crazy, but he\u0027s always got the control. I never get any. He doesn’t relinquish an ounce of it. Is this still part of the game to make me better? I feel like I\u0027m getting worse. You should really take this part out.\" I feel sick imagining him with the other female patients. I sit again and cup my face in my hands. My breath is lost and erratic. She walks across the room and sits quietly. She watches me. Her eyes are scaring me. \"You have been having sexual relations with Mr. Adams? Actual sex?\" I look up, mouth-agape, \"How did you not clue into that? I\u0027ve been strung out on him for months. Even when he was just the benefactor…even then.\" I can\u0027t finish the rest of the sentence. \"As a protector and a torturer. Not as a lover. Not a real one. The goal was to push you to the brink and make you walk the rest of the way.\" She has never let me see behind the curtain before. It feels like the Wizard of Oz and I\u0027m just now seeing the little man and disappointment is everywhere. There is no Wizard. There is only the plan that was clearly hatched by a couple people, who don’t have clue what they\u0027re doing. \"So you had no part in the seduction of the poor orphan?\" She crosses her arms, she is losing the control. He\u0027s taken it from her as well. Or maybe this time it\u0027s me. \"I would have strongly discouraged anything between you two. He sees you as his little sister in a lot of ways.\" That makes me almost vomit. I breathe it back. \"He saved you. You replaced her in his heart. His protective instincts are brotherly. He is still very sick and needs a lot of care. He has never made it as far as you have, ever. His control issues have remained firm and rigid. Saving you has been the only mission in his life, since he found you. Before that it was all about finding you. He maintained your existence, even when the rest of us believed you to be a creation of his mind. Even finding you though, he has not come alive again. All he cares about is saving you, like he never did his sister. He does nothing for himself.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-lonely-the-lonely-1/page-34.html","bookId":1888,"book":{"id":1888,"title":"The Lonely (The Lonely #1)","description":"Storyline: The Lonely (The Lonely #1) 19+ The truth is subjective to what the lonely lets in.
