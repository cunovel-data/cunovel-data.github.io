Sorry. You need to give things time. It\u0027s been a couple weeks since school started again. You spent the winter break in therapy. I\u0027m pretty sure you are doing amazingly compared to other people in your situation. I mean come on. Give yourself a break. You\u0027ve just remembered things most people haven\u0027t seen in a horror movie.\" I stand up. The bill isn’t there but I can\u0027t stay. \"I need to wait outside.\" I grab my jacket and walk out. My heart is racing. My tongue is numb. I grip my cell phone. When I burst through the front door of the restaurant, before the valet can even get the door, I\u0027m huffing in air. My hand is shaking. I hate the way he makes me feel. I pull my phone out. I smile when I see the ten \u0027Hi\u0027 messages and text, \u0027I need you\u0027 and walk to the awning. I stand there and take deep breaths. My phone vibrates, I smile when I see it. \u0027I need you too\u0027 Sebastian walks out doing up his pea coat, \"You okay?\" I shake my head, \"I don’t think I can do this.\" I point between us. \"I\u0027m sorry. I didn’t mean to lead you on. I just can\u0027t do this. I\u0027m never going to be this girl.\" I hear the car. I look back. Stuart has the SUV parked across the street illegally. His favorite way to park. I step in and kiss Sebatsian\u0027s cheek. I savor the smell of him for a moment, \"Goodnight.\" I turn and leave before he can say anything. I jump into the SUV and bury my face in my hands. I\u0027m not crying. I\u0027m terrified. I don’t know of what. Stuart drives. He knows not to talk. He\u0027s seen worse than this. The SUV stops outside Eli\u0027s building. I look up, \"He asked you to bring me here?\" He shakes his head, \"He said you needed to be picked up.\" \"You brought me here?\" He climbs out and opens the door, \"I did. You don’t look like you can do Michelle or alone. I know what that feels like. When I met Eli I was boxing for real. For money to pay for drugs.\" He grabs my hand and squeezes, \"I get it.\" \"Thanks Stuart.\" \"Nothing to thank me for. I\u0027ll wait here if you want.\" I look down and blush, \"Naw, you go home. Or my place or wherever the hell you two go.\" \"She isn’t talking to me.\" I grimace, \"She\u0027s Italian. You gotta go for the grand gesture. Huge.\" I turn and run across the street and through the open door. \"Good evening Miss.\" I nod at the valet and run to the elevator. \"Uhm Miss.\" I look at the front desk guy. He blushes and shakes his head, \"Never mind.\" My cheeks flush. I press the button and step inside. When the doors close I grin, like a fool. My heart is racing. I\u0027m thinking about a million things and really it\u0027s only one thing. I can barely swallow. The door dings. I jump when the doors open, he\u0027s standing there. His face is dark. His eyes are dark. He grabs my hand and pulls me off the elevator. He doesn’t kiss me. He drags me through the dark apartment. My boots thump along as we almost run through the apartment. He opens a metal door and flings me inside. Candles are lit. But in the darkness I can see what it is. My skin shivers as I look around. It\u0027s a warm room with a fireplace flickering light off of the paddles along the wall. The bed is huge, four posts of dark, thick wood with a railing like it should be a canopy but he doesn’t have one there. A strap hangs off one of the posts. He flicks my chin, \"You need to see this. You need to know. This is what I need you for.\" He closes the door. The hollow sound of it clicking makes me jerk around. The firelight licks his face. I see him the way I imagined he would be when he was just a benefactor. \"You don’t scare me.\" I whisper but I know I can\u0027t hide the horror on my face. It takes a second for the shock to sink in. I tremble seeing the paddles. I wonder if any of them are the one he hit me with. My feet cramp up. He takes a step towards me. His voice is gruff and cruel. He spits when he talks and points around the dark room, \"You texted me, Sarah. You needed me. This is me. This is what I have to offer. I don’t have anything else to give you.\" My fingers are unsteady when I lift them to the zipper on my coat and pull down slowly, watching his gaze. I let it slip off my shoulders, challenging him with my gaze. I\u0027m terrified and excited. It\u0027s the first time I\u0027ve felt anything since the last time he touched me. He steps back and sits in the chair in the corner. His grin is smug and cocky. He sits with his legs spread, like before. \"Undress.\" He watches me. I take a deep breath and pull my shirt off, dropping it to the floor next to my jacket. I slip off my boots. He licks his lips. I\u0027m wearing the bandeau, which I\u0027ve grown fond of. His eyes are burning. I hold his gaze when I unzip my pants and wiggle my way out of them. I\u0027m standing in my bandeau and panties. I shiver, and not from the cold. The crackle of the fire and my racing heart fill the air. \"Go to the bed.\" I turn my back on him and walk to the bed slowly. I don’t know what to expect. I put my hands on the bed. Before I get a chance to crawl up on it, his body is against mine. He\u0027s got me pinned with his arms around me. He grabs my hands and lifts them up in the air. I grip the railing on the top of the bed. \"Don’t move those hands,\" he whispers into my nape. I nod and lick my lips. I\u0027m on my tiptoes. My breath is catching and coming out spurts of rough air. His hands run down my arms. I shiver and pant. His lips brush the back of my neck. He sweeps my hair to one side, kissing down my shoulder blade. Heat and nerves battle low in my belly as his hands grip my hips, pulling me back to him. \"Don\u0027t let go of that railing, Sarah.\" His words are growled between kisses and licks. I hear the menacing threat in them. I wince when he nibbles my back. His hands are rubbing and lightly pinching my stomach. He doesn’t touch anything I want him to. His lips reach my panties. His fingers trace the fabric along my butt. It tickles and makes me squirm but I don’t move my hands. He is the man from the room, with the paddle and the cocky smile that felt no remorse. I fear him in a way that excites me. His fingers dip into my underwear, trailing their way around my waist. I feel him stand and lean against me, like he is trying to make me let go of the railing. I am obedient if I am anything. He has made me this way. I grip it for dear life and anticipation of where it will all go. In the dim light I see his movements making shadows on the wall across from me. A blindfold is pulled over my head. The darkness is familiar. He moves around me and sits on the bed. I think I\u0027m standing between his legs. I can feel the heat of him around the front of me and the heat of the fire behind me. I\u0027m shivering but I\u0027m not cold in any way. He feels so large, like he\u0027s all around me, encompassing me. Something brushes against my right nipple. I gasp. I think it\u0027s his finger tracing my nipple through the rough lace of the bandeau. I falter in my ability to stand on my tiptoes. He thumbs my nipple until it sticks out. Then his other hand finds my other one. He\u0027s flicking and lightly squeezing both my nipples. He does it in a pattern that resonates through my body. I\u0027m squeezing my thighs together and biting my lips. His mouth caresses my stomach. He kisses and trails his tongue up my abdomen. He flips the bandeau down, I moan loudly. I don’t even know why. His mouth clamps down on my nipple as his fingers continue the pinching and tugging of the other. He sucks and licks in a swirling motion. My stomach tightens. I don’t know what\u0027s happening but I\u0027m getting lost in it all. \"Are you going to come for me, Sarah? Before I even touch your pussy?\" His voice is warm against my wet nipple. I moan louder and squeeze my thighs so tight, I lose my grip. \"Come for me baby.\" He sucks harder and tugs on my nipple. I orgasm. I let go of the railing, twitching and crying out. I\u0027m gripping his shoulders and head. Instantly, he\u0027s off the bed. My face is shoved into the soft blankets. I\u0027m still breathing heavy and confused. I can barely keep my mouth closed. \"I told you to keep your hands there.\" He\u0027s pressed against me. One of his hands is holding me against the bed, dragging up and down my back. He steps back. I lie there and wait, breathing into the bedding. I hear him walking, making his shoes make noise against the floor. My eyes try blinking against the blindfold. I don’t know what to expect. I\u0027m terrified about the paddles. My feet are clenching the floor in desperate protests. His hand touches my ass cheek again. I whimper. I jump when he rubs something cold against me. It\u0027s wide and I have no idea what to expect. \"If you struggle, I will hit you harder.\" His voice is ice. I\u0027m clutching the blanket and breathing into it. My jaw is trembling with terror and a perverse idea of where this is going. His hand creeps along my underwear to my belly. He presses and then suddenly something connects with my skin. I scream out. It stings but shocks more. It\u0027s gone and then his hand presses into my stomach again and the metal cracks me on the ass cheek. I\u0027ve squirmed slightly. He pulls my hips, arching my back more. \"Touch your toes together,\" he growls at me. I do it quickly. He pulls my butt back further. The third strike hurts a bit but the vibration of the impact against my groin makes my scream sound more like a moan. I never saw that coming. The smacks mellow out but come more frequently. My stomach is tightening again with every vibration the striking creates. Each smack vibrates against my groin. I feel like I need to move in a thousand different ways but can\u0027t. He slows down the rhythm. \"Faster.\" I mutter breathlessly into the blanket. He chuckles, \"No, no, no. You\u0027ve had an orgasm. You don’t get another one.\" The next hit is hard, it stings. I wince and suck my breath. \"That\u0027s my girl.\" The next hit is the same. My butt starts to go numb to the heat of the room but still stings. I hear the paddle drop. It makes the same sound it did when he dropped it from paddling my feet.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-lonely-the-lonely-1/page-28.html","bookId":1888,"book":{"id":1888,"title":"The Lonely (The Lonely #1)","description":"Storyline: The Lonely (The Lonely #1) 19+ The truth is subjective to what the lonely lets in.
