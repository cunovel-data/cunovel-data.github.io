His is even.\n Warm air is creeping between my legs. His hands traipse their way up my calf, still rubbing and massaging. Something warm and soft brushes my leg, just above the knee. When it\u0027s gone the spot feels cold.\n It was his mouth.\n I tremble as his hands work their way up to my thigh. I\u0027m about to burst with something. Some small part of it is fear. Ragged and desperate fear.\n His mouth is on my thigh. I feel his tongue licking where his lips have kissed. I gasp. It\u0027s not in horror. It\u0027s in shock. He chuckles and I feel sick again.\n He is gone and the air is all there is between my legs, I don’t feel his clothing pressing against my naked skin or his warmth. I don’t feel his weight on the bed at all.\n \"Are you ashamed of yourself?\" His whispers.\n I shake my head but it’s a lie. I am desperately ashamed.\n \"What\u0027s the worst thing that can happen right now?\"\n My eyes are squeezed shut. I don’t want to answer him. I know the answer but I can\u0027t say it.\n \"What\u0027s the worst thing?\"\n \"You rape m-m-me.\" I mutter into the darkness.\n \"You asked me to do it. Doesn’t that change things? You said you wanted me.\" He says it softly.\n I feel my lips curl into a sneer. I did. I asked him to. I offered myself up.\n The air is cold somehow, even with the heat. I shiver. He places something on me. I feel with my fingers. It\u0027s the other side of the blanket. He\u0027s wrapped me up.\n I hear his silent footsteps and the door. I am alone. I curl into a ball and grip the covers. The tears start. I pull away the blindfold.\n He is there beside me, sitting in a chair beside the bed. His face is sad. I stop crying. I didn’t hear him come back in. Maybe he never left. Maybe I\u0027m hearing things.\n \"Why are you crying?\" He asks. I shake my head. \"You don’t know do you?\"\n I shake my head again. He leans forward, \"I would never have hurt you like that, but if I had, it wouldn’t have been the end of you. I need you to see that. You\u0027ve survived everything else. So much more than any human can fathom. You think one act can destroy all the strength you have?\"\n I shudder from the tears and the heaving sobs. I shake my head.\n His blue eyes burn suddenly. He climbs onto the bed and wraps himself around me. The warmth is a comfort.\n He\u0027s insane but I think I am too.\n Chapter Twelve\n I wake up in the cell. He\u0027s moved me somehow and I didn’t notice.\n \"Stuart.\" I whisper.\n He doesn’t answer me. I crawl along the floor, slightly disoriented. When I reach the hole in the wall my arm bumps against something.\n It scratches on the floor and scares me. I jump back. I reach out slowly, terrified of what it is.\n It\u0027s flat. When I get a grip on it I sigh.\n It\u0027s my cell phone. I push the button to turn the power on. It shows the apple and makes a dim light in the cell.\n I\u0027m more scared with the light there, it makes shadows. I see my white robe in the light. I never even noticed it was there. My comfort in my skin is different than before.\n I turn the phone when it comes on and shine the light in the hole to the room next to me. There is a bed and a toilet. His cell is much nicer than mine. I\u0027m not angry, I\u0027m grateful he has those things. He isn’t in the room.\n I scuttle back to my corner and tuck my feet under me. My phone starts to vibrate like mad. Seventy-five messages. My eyes widen.\n I start reading Shell\u0027s.\n \u0027Em, I\u0027m so sorry. I shouldn’t have said and done that. I\u0027m so glad I came with you. Please don’t be mad.\u0027\n \u0027Dude, I said sorry. What do you want blood\u0027\n \u0027Em why aren’t these delivering?\"\n \u0027Did you for-reals turn the phone off?\u0027\n \u0027I saw Sebastian today. It\u0027s been like a week since I got home and you aren’t texting me. I told him your number. I don’t even care if Uncle Daddy gets mad. Sebastian is a mess, dude. Destroyed. He is so upset. He flew all the way here to find you. From Maine dude.\u0027\n \u0027I CAN\u0027T BELIEVE YOU\u0027RE BEING SO SEFLISH AND PETTY AND IGNORING ME! DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW HARD IT IS TO TEXT AND HOLD THE CAPSLOCK?\u0027\n \u0027Emmmmmmmmmmm don’t hate me\u0027\n \u0027I miss you.\u0027\n \u0027Now you\u0027re making me scared. This is fucking bitchy dude\u0027\n \u0027Oh and Merry Christmas Asshole!\u0027\n I lower the phone. My heart burns and hurts. I start to cry. I\u0027m so alone and desperate and I\u0027ve been kidding myself. Who did I honestly think would believe I was fine? Why the hell did I ever leave that church? I could be training to be a sister with Beth.\n I look around the dark and feel more lost than before. I start to feel rage burning inside of me.\n I tilt my head up and shout, \"I want out.\" I scream. \"I WANT OUT YOU ASSHOLE. ELI, YOU SICK MOTHER FUCKER I WANT OUT!\" I sob and lean into the wall. I almost throw the phone but I stop myself.\n No one comes. My tears dry and I start reading the texts again.\n \u0027Emalyn, you are being so mean. I\u0027m scared. Please just text and tell me you\u0027re okay.\u0027\n The next message is from me, \u0027She doesn’t have this phone now. Please stop texting\u0027\n \u0027YOU SICK SON OF A BITCH IF YOU HAVE DONE ANYTHING TO HER I\u0027LL KILL YOU WITH MY BARE HANDS!\u0027\n \u0027I\u0027ll let her know you messaged her.\u0027\n \"FUCK YOU!\"\n I snort.\n I go back to the menu and find Sebastian\u0027s. I assume they\u0027re his. They have only a number and no name.\n \u0027Em? Is this you?\u0027\n \u0027Sorry but I found Michelle yesterday in Clovis. I got your number. I hope you\u0027re okay with this.\u0027\n \u0027I just wanted to say sorry. I never should have left. I\u0027ve tried coming by the dorm but you\u0027re never there. The guy at the gym said he hasn’t seen you and Michelle said she hasn’t heard from you. I\u0027m getting worried.\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027re that angry? Michelle is getting scared. She phoned the police yesterday. You\u0027re officially a missing person. My heart is broken I think. I have so many things I need to tell you.\u0027\n \u0027You\u0027ve been missing for two weeks. I\u0027m coming for you. I will find you.\u0027\n \u0027She doesn’t have this phone anymore. Please stop texting.\u0027\n \u0027Who is this? Where is she?\u0027\n \u0027I will let her know you messaged her.\u0027\n \u0027Where is she? If you have her or hurt her I will kill you.\u0027\n I don’t want to read the hopelessness in their messages. I look around the dark and start to plot. I guess it\u0027s another thing about the dark. It\u0027s perfect for plotting.\n When I realize my plotting is petty and entirely based on superheroes and the desperate hope Sebastian is one, I sigh, and give up. I open my conversation with Eli. I can see the little writing thingy. He is messaging me as I look at it.\n He is watching me. It\u0027s 1984 in so many ways.\n \u0027How are things?\u0027\n I shake my head, \u0027I hate you. How could you do this to Stuart and me? Why did you do this?\u0027\n \u0027I need you to hurt and cry. I need those things from you.\u0027\n The answer is as messed up as everything else that’s happened is. I shake my head, \u0027You\u0027re sick. I\u0027ll never cry for you again.\u0027\n \u0027Don\u0027t make promises you can\u0027t keep.\u0027\n I dial nine-one-one but the service is cut. The texts are working because of the wifi. I feel like an idiot. All this time he was there for me and helping me, but it was all to what end? This? Alone in a cell, flogged, beaten, humiliated? I don’t understand.\n I crawl to where the hole is and lie on my side. I reach my hand through the hole and pretend I can feel the warmth of Stuart\u0027s hand against mine. There is no defense for the stupidity I am guilty of. The words of Sister Elizabeth bounce around in my head. \"Nothing is ever free Emalyn. Nothing. At some point you pay for everything.\" I have a horrid feeling I might be paying for things I can\u0027t remember.\n I fall asleep with my back to the open air of the room and my hand in the hole. It\u0027s huge for me. I have nothing left to lose. No one can hurt me more than I have already been.\n My sleep and dreams are restless and chaotic. I wake with my face against the cement. I move my hand and have a small panic attack. It brings something with it from a place I\u0027ve sealed of in my mind.\n The hole.\n I have the strangest feeling like I\u0027m in the hole. I move my hand like I\u0027m reaching for the sunshine. The cold cement and the darkness make me shiver. I can feel the bugs crawling on me. I scramble up and begin brushing my body off.\n I hated falling asleep in the hole. My skin is crawling. My whimpers and cries fill the darkness.\n I back up, scrambling and swiping at my robe. Pressing my back against the wall, I take gulps of air. I feel the walls of the corner and feel better.\n \"I\u0027m not in the hole. I\u0027m not in the hole.\" I shake my head. The hole had no corners.\n Whatever is attached to the hole memory is fuzzy and bad. My brain shuts down. It doesn\u0027t let me see further behind the curtain than that.\n I clutch my cell phone and press the power button.\n The apple sign and the light make me feel better. I\u0027m exhausted and done. I open our conversation and text.\n \u0027I want to go home. I don’t want your money and help. I just want to be free.\u0027\n \u0027Where will you go?\u0027 His response is fast. Like he knew I would text him.\n My stomach hurts when I think about it, \u0027Women\u0027s shelter? Convent? Anywhere I can to get away from you.\u0027\n \u0027That\u0027s hurtful considering I am the only person in the world you have.\u0027\n \u0027I would laugh. If I weren’t sitting in the dark smelling my own piss and feeling disturbed and disgusted at the thought of what you\u0027ll do to me next.\u0027 I look at it, read it over again and press send. My stomach hurts being so sassy.\n The phone vibrates with a Facetime call. His call. I take a moment and answer it.\n \"Hi.\" He\u0027s acting like we are friends again. The anxiety is killing me. His face is bright and beautiful. It sickens me to be attracted to him. \"Where will you go without me?\" He sounds different than before. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-lonely-the-lonely-1/page-19.html","bookId":1888,"book":{"id":1888,"title":"The Lonely (The Lonely #1)","description":"Storyline: \n The Lonely (The Lonely #1) \n 19+ \n The truth is subjective to what the lonely lets in. \n Emalyn Spicer has lived with it for a long time.
