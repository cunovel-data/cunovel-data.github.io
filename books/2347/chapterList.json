In Lee Child\u0027s astonishing new thriller, Reacher\u0027s arrival will change everything--about a case that isn\u0027t what it seems, about lives tangled in baffling ways, about a killer who missed one shot-and by doing so give Jack Reacher one shot at the truth.... \n The gunman worked from a parking structure just thirty yards away-point-blank range for a trained military sniper like James Barr. His victims were in the wrong place at the wrong time. But why does Barr want Reacher at his side? There are good reasons why Reacher is the last person Barr would want to see. But when Reacher hears Barr\u0027s own words, he understands. And a slam-dunk case explodes. Soon Reacher is teamed with a young defense lawyer who is working against her D.A. father and dueling with a prosecution team that has an explosive secret of its own. Like most things Reacher has known in life, this case is a complex battlefield. But, as always, in battle, Reacher is at his best. \n Moving in the shadows, picking his spots, Reacher gets closer and closer to the unseen enemy who is pulling the strings. And for Reacher, the only way to take him down is to know his ruthlessness and respect his cunning-and then match him shot for shot.... \"From the Hardcover edition.\"\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/one-shot-jack-reacher-9.jpg","author":"Lee Child","type":"Mystery","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/one-shot-jack-reacher-9.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:37 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 10:00:34 AM"}},{"id":66323,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/one-shot-jack-reacher-9/page-15.html","bookId":2347,"book":{"id":2347,"title":"One Shot (Jack Reacher #9)","description":"Storyline: \n One Shot (Jack Reacher #9) \n Six shots.
