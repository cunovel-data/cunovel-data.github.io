{"id":29482,"no":4,"title":"Chapter 4","content":"Hogwash! Now he knew that each man forms his own definition. True, too many people used the word love indiscriminately. It\u0027s mistreated. Kicked around. Assumed and taken off. Dragged through messes and scandals and law courts and through the mud. But to a man like Jay Welch, to a man who has been afraid—yes, afraid—to use it, it must be there when he begins thinking in those terms. Love. He\u0027d had to come across one-hundred years to realize he\u0027d found its meaning. To realize he\u0027d known its meaning a long time. To realize that love is whatever you make it, what you, yourself, call it. You define it yourself. Then you apply it. It had been there all the time. You don\u0027t include someone in everything you do and everything you think without it. You don\u0027t try to change her and yourself. To make her perfect. To make yourself perfect with—and for—her without it. This business about \"accepting\" little faults—as well as big ones—, he decided, is for the birds. It\u0027s human nature to translate other people in terms of yourself and try to change them in terms of yourself. To argue and be proud and hate like hell to have to make up. But you don\u0027t make a project of it with everyone. Not unless.... He and Julie had a lot to talk about. Then he remembered where he was and when he was. He thought of Doctor Schink. And suddenly he was scared. He remembered what Ilaria had said about Schink. \u0027He\u0027s there for good....\u0027 \"He\u0027s never said a word about my going back!\" \"Neither have you,\" came Ilaria\u0027s voice, and Jay whirled around to see the big psychologist coming through the door. \"We\u0027d like to keep you here as long as possible. But not against your wishes, of course. You were shanghaied, not kidnaped.\" The left corner of his wide mouth pulled back in that slow, reassuring smile. \"I stand chastised. Now I\u0027ve thought of it, though, I can hardly wait.\" \"The day after tomorrow? I want you to hear Caesar speak. Then I want to talk a good deal more.\" \"Early, the day after tomorrow.\" Then, little-boyishly, Jay hurriedly added a couple of reasons. \"I\u0027m getting tired of talking and being questioned. I feel like a talking animal in the zoo.\" Ilaria nodded, smiling. \"Julie? \"I figured it would occur to you sooner or later. Just because you think a little more deeply and carefully than most men of your time doesn\u0027t make you immune to love. That belongs to all times. Good luck and a lot of children.\" Jay grinned. He\u0027d met Ilaria\u0027s wife and five of his six children the night before. He turned to look out the window once more. Beautiful. The elevated streets, with gyro-cars hurtling along ... the sky full of more winged gyros and planes ... the streets below full of happy, white-faced, white-clad people.... White-faced! \"Kevin, you avoided my question the day before yesterday. I\u0027ve been almost afraid to ask you again. Why no Negroes?\" \"It will be hard for you to accept, with your antiquated democratic ideas.\" Ilaria breathed a deep sigh. \"Certain elements of dissension and unrest, Jay, are better eliminated. Coloreds have always bred both. People are just like that. Whites and yellows and tans and reds can get along, but not blacks.\" Jay had gotten along with them all his life. \"In ancient Rome there were slaves ...\" he said, trying to understand. \"Not in this Rome. I said, better eliminated, Jay.\" Ilaria went to the window and looked down at the scene below. He explained: \"We exterminated them.\" A hammer crashed down. A door slammed. A glass shattered. A siren screeched. A punch caught Jay in the solar plexus. Jay had experienced all these. Ilaria\u0027s flat statement was worse. \"Exter—No! Oh, No!\" He swung around to face the big psychologist. Ilaria\u0027s usual smile was gone. He looked solemn and very grim. \"You weren\u0027t ready for it. I don\u0027t think we can discuss it. Just remember this: When you\u0027ve a bunch of dogs and they all get along with one another except one, you don\u0027t leave them together and you don\u0027t try to keep them separated by a chicken-wire fence. It\u0027s too unpleasant. You get rid of the troublemaker.\" During the night the rebel forces moved out of Tel Aviv and took over Israel. They captured the entire devastated Washington area, a series of ten cities ringing Rome, and hundreds of other key spots. The world\u0027s largest airbase at Madrid, Spain, was taken. Forces sent to the aid of the base defenders were met by an onslaught of their own planes. The troops didn\u0027t have a chance. Dr. Montmorency Trumperi\u0027s Wave Disturber had been outlawed in 2001. The plans were carefully filed away and the machine\u0027s component parts junked. But the Disturber suddenly reappeared on the night of June 9, 2054, and world communications were stopped. Lamberti\u0027s scientists had come up with a counter-radio mechanism, of course, so that the Rebels were able to maintain contacts. Louisville was not attacked. Lamberti and his men knew about the emissary from the past sheltered there, and informed their fifth columnists at Standiford they wanted both the Man From 1954 and Tribune Kevin Ilaria alive. New York was attacked by land and air. Tokyo fell. Everywhere white flags with the blue Liberacione and the picture of a dove fluttered above smoking battlegrounds. Everywhere men were on the march. When Tribune Kevin Ilaria stormed in twelve hours later, Jay noticed his friend was wearing his gun again. The cyanide pistol had not swung at his hip since the day of Jay\u0027s arrival. He was also surprised to note that Ilaria wore boots and carried a steel helmet under his arm. There was a new quality in his voice. Brittle, static. The soft tones of the psychologist were gone. Jay realized that this was Tribune Ilaria of the Forces, not Dr. Ilaria the psychologist. \"You sure you want to leave here tomorrow?\" he demanded curtly. Instantly Jay was on the defence. \"I am,\" he said coldly. Ilaria\u0027s smile looked forced. \"I\u0027ve been authorized to offer you a Sub-Tribunate in the Forces.\" \"What?\" \"You\u0027ve had experience. None of us have. You\u0027ve been in actual combat, in the Air Force.\" \"Why? I don\u0027t—\" \"War,\" Ilaria said simply. \"Rebellion.\" Jay stared at him. He couldn\u0027t think of anything to say. Ilaria turned away. \"Paradise. The Iron Hand. One religion and one language and all that. Utterly cock-sure. But ... we were wrong. They\u0027ve been getting ready. Training and planning. Collecting men and arms. They began even before the empire was established.\"—Jay noticed he said empire rather than republic—\"All this time they\u0027ve been preparing and planning and ... waiting.\" Jay was dumbfounded. \"How big is it?\" Kevin Ilaria spread his hands. \"Big enough. Their attack seems to have been simultaneous all over the world. Something like commando or guerrilla tactics. Quick, quiet attacks on a small scale.\" He told Jay about the Tel Aviv incident and about Captain Spagnoletti and a half-track disappearing in the rubble in the Washington area and about intercontinental communication being shut off. \"Bomb \u0027em out,\" Jay said, without thinking. \"You don\u0027t bomb out fifth columnists, Jay. \"Last night they captured London and Tokyo and two-thirds of New York and they captured Lollabrigida airbase in Madrid. They\u0027re wearing PR uniforms and some kind of new uniform they\u0027ve dreamed up. Most of them aren\u0027t even uniformed. It\u0027s a hell of a mess.\" \"How long do you think it\u0027ll take to quell the thing?\" \"I have no idea. I\u0027m to take command at Standiford Field. Rinaldi solved the saboteur problem ... it was Colonel Di Orio. Rinaldi and some of his boys caught the Colonel and a few of his men in the Radio Room on the special \u0027Liberacione\u0027 wave length.\" \"In irons?\" Jay wanted to know. \"No. They put up a fight. They were killed.\" \"You\u0027re flying?\" \"Doubt it. I\u0027ll be one of those behind-the-scenes men. Supposed to be valuable. Only in a mess like this you can\u0027t tell what\u0027s behind the scenes and what\u0027s front line. They\u0027re liable to start on Louisville next.\" Ilaria hitched self-consciously at his gun-belt. He twisted his helmet around a couple of times before he set it gingerly on his head. He turned and opened the door and went out. His head came back in and said: \"I\u0027m not sure it\u0027s the sort of thing you quell, Jay.\" \"Kevin! Wait! What\u0027m I supposed to—\" He was gone. Jay thought only a moment. Then he switched on the phone. At least intercom systems were still in operation. The clerk at the desk upstairs looked at him from the screen. \"This is the Man From 1954,\" Jay said, using the name by which everyone called him. \"Stop Tribune Ilaria as he goes out.\" In an instant Kevin\u0027s head appeared. \"I\u0027ll go with you. Shall I get my uniform before we go to Standiford or after?\" Ilaria grinned. \"After,\" he said. \"Grab the elevator and come on up.\" This isn\u0027t your fight, Jay Welch, a voice told him as he opened the door. You don\u0027t even belong here, Jay Welch, the voice told him as he ran out into the hall. You\u0027re crazy to go to bat for these monsters, Jay Welch, the voice told him as he pushed the elevator button. You fought before for a bunch of people who didn\u0027t appreciate it one damned bit, Jay Welch. Remember about the Iron Hand and the Negroes, the voice told him as the doors opened and he stepped in. Remember you were shanghaied, it said, as the car shot upward and the bottom of his stomach felt as if it had been left behind. Remember you were going back to Duo Point and Herman\u0027s and Joe Scaccia\u0027s restaurant and Julie and tie and suit and Julie and the tight shoes and Julie and personal freedom and Julie and Jerry, the black guy you worked with and liked so well and Julie and the new Olds and Julie. Tomorrow you were going back. The doors shot back. He stepped out on the roof. \"Mister Welcci?\" said the clerk. \"That\u0027s Tribune Ilaria\u0027s plane over there.\" He pointed to the little PR ship marked with the three silver diamonds of a Tribune and the staff of psychology. Jay ran. Wind was whipping across the roof and their cloaks streamed out and fluttered. The three men came together. \"This is Commander DeVito, Jay. Commander, Jay Welch, The Man From 1954.\" The way Ilaria said it always made it sound capitalized. They shook hands. They got into the plane and shot straight up and the city was a blur beneath them. In less than a minute the little flier dropped down faster than any elevator and landed at Standiford. \"Sergeant, Sub-Tribune Welcci needs a uniform. A—\" \"Forty long,\" Jay suggested, then colored. Tunic and a hundred years made a difference in his size. He went with the supply-sergeant, who gave him a correct fit the first time—times have changed, Jay grunted—and fitted him with a helmet on the second try. He felt a tremor as he buckled on the pellet gun. With the cloak flapping about his heels and the gun banging his leg and the helmet biting his ear he ran to the elevator and down to the room Kevin had designated. The Tribune and Commander DeVito and five or six other officers were standing around a table in the steel-walled underground room. Before them was a gigantic map. They looked up as Jay burst in. \"This is The Man From 1954,\" Ilaria said. There were hand-shakes all around that reminded Jay of fraternity rush. DeVito and one of the others wore wings. Jay wondered if that were still a pilot\u0027s insignia. The red X\u0027s on the map, they told him, were places under attack. The blue ones were areas taken by the fast-moving rebels. He learned that the messenger-jet they\u0027d sent to Rome—they were lost without their instantaneous push-button communications system—hadn\u0027t made it. More had been sent. Meanwhile they were on their own. The nearest major battle was at Chicago, where Cocuzzi Flight Base was located. Ilaria despatched Commander DeVito and something like fifty jet fighters to Chicago. The other man was in charge of a group of B-90 Stratosonic bombers. They lifted their fists in stiff-armed salute and left. \"The rest of the ships will remain here, ready for instant take-off. I\u0027ll command interception. Sub-Tribune Rinaldi will command the base in case I have to go up. \"I can\u0027t understand why we haven\u0027t been jumped yet. We must assume they\u0027ll attack Louisville because of Standiford and the Time Building. They\u0027ll also be interested in you, Jay.\" By 2:00 that afternoon Louisville had not yet been attacked. Abruptly at 1:59 world communications went into operation. Everyone turned on his television set, wondering if Caesar\u0027s talk would go on as scheduled. It did. There was a screaming crowd before the Capitol. On the high balcony stood the Dictator. At his side stood Senator Chianti and around them were ringed Caesar\u0027s Pretorian Guards. The city was nearly empty of field soldiers. They had gone out to meet the insurgents. \"People of the Republic of Rome.\" The noise subsided as Caesar raised his hands and spoke. \"You have all heard of the revolt now in progress against us throughout the Empire.\" Ilaria nodded at the Caesar\u0027s psychologically clever use of the word us. \"With your aid, my people, we can put a quick end to this treason. You have seen better than half a century of peaceful, successful government. These traitors and conspirators would attempt to overthrow our government and put an end to this peace ... this Peace of Rome. \"The world is now in a state of emergency. If you, my people, will bear with me through this period of crisis we will return to our world of peace and serenity once more.\" Cheers. Wild applause. \"They believe him,\" Jay murmured. Ilaria looked at him. \"Of course,\" he said. \"For a long time our Empire has remained ...\" Caesar\u0027s face stiffened. The deep-set, weary eyes blazed and widened. His hand reached out for the railing. Then he stiffened again and was limp as the bursting pellet of sulphuric acid and potassium cyanide took effect. Gaius Julius Caesar Imperator V fell. There was uproar and clamor and shrieking. Jay and Ilaria stood, staring, as the Pretorian Guards levelled their guns and became a solid, surrounding wall. The T-V cameramen were getting the scene of the century. \"Lamberti!\" Ilaria bit out. The Pretorian Prefect, his hands outspread, stood on the balcony over Caesar\u0027s body. The white cloak with Liberacione on it fluttered about him. A couple of Pretorians came out with an amplifier. \"Friends, Romans, Countrymen,\" said Farouk Lamberti. \"—every available long-range ship to Rome,\" Ilaria\u0027s brittle voice was hacking out orders. \"Every one. Contact every other base while communications are still working!\" \"... a noble man. But not the man to govern Earth. No, not he nor his government. I bring you a new government. I, Farouk Lamberti, long his best friend, have done this not to him, but for him. For you. The Earth was not meant to be governed by a system of—\" \"Yes, I said bomb Rome.\" Sub-Tribune Rinaldi smiled. \"But Kevin, my friend, we can\u0027t bomb Lamberti just when he\u0027s getting a good start.\" Jay looked up. Kevin Ilaria spun around. \"What?\" \"Never trust old friends, Kevin. Colonel Di Orio didn\u0027t. He surprised us in the Radio Room and we were forced to put him out of the way. Also remember this: all members of the Liberacione carry gamma pistols.\" Rinaldi pulled out his gamma gun and shot Ilaria through the middle. Jay was horrified. He forgot where he was and when he was and what he was doing. All he knew was that there was a cyanide gun at his hip and that this man had shot Ilaria. His gun came up and sputtered. The pellet caught Rinaldi just under the chin and burst. Rinaldi collapsed. \"Had a—gamma gun—not ... deadly. Slow-acting ... radio-activity. Hardly ... burned me. Come on—we\u0027ve got to ... get back to the—Time building.\" \"Oh, no we won\u0027t. You\u0027re hurt. We—\" \"Don\u0027t argue. Sergeant! Saaarguunt!\" Ilaria gasped at the exertion of shouting. The Centurion ran in. \"We\u0027ve got to—get to the—Time building.\" \"Rinaldi shot the Tribune. Rinaldi was a traitor,\" Jay explained rapidly. Ilaria\u0027s gun clicked and the Centurion shuddered back and fell through the door. The gamma burst from his pistol hit the wall. \"God! Is everyone a traitor?\" Jay demanded of the Universe. People are easily swayed. It didn\u0027t take them long to espouse the new cause. They were helped along in their decision by the Liberacione planes hovering overhead with loads of KCN-H2SO4 bombs. The whispering campaign Lamberti had carefully started about germ warfare helped, too. Those who didn\u0027t switch over rapidly were jumped by the new forces. Tribune Ilaria in Louisville, Kentucky, in America held out as long as he could. Then the bombers came. And the Tribune fled to the Time building. The building shook. A table shivered and a lamp shattered. A jet fighter flew close by the window and the Centurion watched fearfully as it flipped on one delta wing and fired a tracer burst into a PR ship. The defender exploded in mid-air. Ilaria looked twenty years older than the man who had smiled and welcomed Jay Welch to 2054. He and a young scientist were preparing the machine to send the man from 1954 back to his own time. \"You\u0027ll have to leave the gun here, Jay.\" Ilaria winced as he bent over a set of dials. \"I\u0027d like to keep the uniform.\" \"All right. Does that do it, Doctor?\" The scientist nodded. He looked at Jay. \"It\u0027s ready,\" he said. \"This switch sets everything in motion, doesn\u0027t it?\" Ilaria asked. \"Yes. That\u0027s the final control.\" \"Then ... I\u0027ll do it. I\u0027d like ... to say something to Jay before he leaves.\" The scientist hesitated a moment, then shrugged and left. The Centurion went to the door. He was a young man and fanatically loyal. \"You all right, Tribune?\" Ilaria smiled. \"I\u0027m ... all right, Sergeant.\" The Centurion nodded and left. \"Sit ... sit down in that chair, Jay, and do your best to relax.\" Jay sat down. A bomber roared overhead. There was a blast nearby. \"What will you do now, Kevin?\" Ilaria shrugged. \"Fight \u0027em \u0027til they come in and we\u0027re sunk. Then I\u0027ll join \u0027em. Why—why die a martyr\u0027s death?\" Of course, Jay told himself. Logical. But Kevin had been so convinced. So utterly sure. Now he looked and sounded like a disillusioned old man. \"Kevin, I\u0027m not trying to rub it in. But—\" \"I know what you\u0027re going to say. I was so sure. Paradise. I was a firm disciple. Convinced. I believed in all of it. I—thought it would last forever. The perfect government. A permanently workable government.\" Jay sat quietly. Ilaria reached for the switch. \"For God\u0027s sake,\" came the voice of 1954, \"what is the perfect workable government?\" Ilaria closed the switch and the light blinded Jay. He felt as if someone had slugged him in the stomach. Slowly the machine prepared to send him back one-hundred years. It warmed up like a jet on a runway. The light faded and Jay opened his eyes. The building rocked. There was a terrific explosion and part of the steel wall buckled. Somewhere a woman screamed. A squadron of fighters hurtled past, spitting fire and death. A bomber fell, exploding as it crashed into a tall apartment building. Jay\u0027s stomach twisted and he knew he was on his way. Ilaria took his gun from his holster and calmly placed its ugly snout against his own face. \"... the perfect workable government?\" Jay\u0027s question of a moment ago reached his ears as he began to slip back, minute by minute, picking up momentum. Ilaria\u0027s reply came dimly.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2852/78712.html","bookId":1214,"book":{"id":1214,"title":"And Gone Tomorrow","description":"简介： Here is the best story submitted in answer to the theme question: What Will Life in America Be Like 100 Years From Now? ...
