{"id":29480,"no":2,"title":"Chapter 2","content":"Ilaria laughed. \"Not reverted. We finally accepted it as the only logical form of government for an entire world.\" \"What happens when the dictator goes wild? He always has.\" The smile was there again. \"You\u0027re not quite ready for that,\" Ilaria told him. \"But, it has been taken into consideration.\" Out of the corner of his eye, Jay saw the slight puff of Ilaria\u0027s chest, the self-satisfied square of his shoulders, the quick set of his jaw. He wondered what part Tribune Kevin Ilaria played in the \u0027dictator control\u0027 this world had provided. \"The system has worked and is working. See this?\" They turned a corner in the corridor and faced a great domed room. On the far wall hung a white tapestry of something like 40 x 40 foot dimensions. On it, emblazoned in letters of red and yellow made to look like flame, were the characters PPB. In the lower right-hand corner, in white outlined with blue, was the same PR that Ilaria wore. Jay waited for the Tribune\u0027s explanation. \"PpB stands for Pax per Bello,\" Ilaria explained. \"Peace through War. That slogan was written in 1967 by Julius and adapted in 1971 as official.\" \"Julius?\" \"Yes. The first Dictator.\" Things were beginning to click in Jay\u0027s mind. \"I think I know what PR stands for,\" he said. \"Pax Romana.\" As always, Ilaria smiled. \"That\u0027s right,\" he said. The command-car marked with the PR symbol pulled over and stopped. \"What is it? Who are you?\" the driver demanded. The Captain on the seat beside him peered into the blackness and cursed. The man who had waved the vehicle to a halt walked away. \"Here!\" the Captain cried. \"What in blazes is going on here? Why\u0027d you stop us? Centurion! Stop that man!\" The two Centurions in the back seat looked at the Captain for a moment, then they both jumped out and ran after the man. An ellipsoidal grey thing streaked out of the darkness, landed in the driver\u0027s lap and thudded to the floor of the car. The Captain threw open his door and started to climb out. The driver bent over to see what it was. At that moment the driver, the command-car and the Captain blew up. The silence that followed was broken by the blast of a submachine gun as it struck down the two centurions. \"Take their weapons,\" said a brittle voice. The detachment of soldiers from the garrison at Tel Aviv stopped and looked around. \"Sir, what is it?\" asked a guard anxiously. \"Terribly quiet out here; something\u0027s up,\" the Lieutenant muttered calmly. There were seven of them. The Lieutenant, the Centurion, and five legionaries. They had grown accustomed to the quiet life of garrison men in a calm, conquered city. When there is nothing tangible to be guarded, a guard\u0027s life is a dull one. The guns they carried were the symbol of their authority, and had never been used for any other purpose. They looked around. The dirty, once-white buildings rose close on either side. There was no moon. There was no sound. The darkness and the silence could have been cut with a knife. The Lieutenant grinned. He didn\u0027t feel much like grinning. He spoke. He didn\u0027t feel much like talking, either. \"This darkness is thick,\" he said. \"You could cut it with a knife. Wish I had a knife.\" He got a knife. The men had just started to laugh when the Lieutenant got it. Between his shoulder blades. As the Lieutenant toppled forward, the Centurion dodged close against the dirty stone wall and yelled \"Spread out!\" They killed a lot of the shadowy, green-clad attackers, but there were only six of them and they were cornered. When the enemy drove a tank into the alley and sprayed them with its mounted gun they died. \"Take their weapons,\" said a quiet voice. The half-track rolled to a stop. \"Where, Sir?\" the driver wanted to know. \"Beyond that big crater over there. The sun glinted on metal. I\u0027m sure of it. Didn\u0027t you see it?\" \"No, Sir.\" The driver craned his neck. There was nothing but barren rubble and bomb craters and torn, twisted metal and ruined buildings. \"There are all sorts of old automobiles lying around out there, Sir,\" the driver volunteered. \"Yes, and they\u0027ve been here long enough to get good and rusty,\" the Captain snapped. \"This is something else.\" The driver craned his neck. There was nothing but rubble. Eight men in the back of the half-track leaped to their feet when they heard the faint clicking of KCN-H2SO4 guns and the buzz of an old gamma gun and the sharp bark of a very old sub machine-gun. But a grenade landed on the truck and another rolled under it. Another wreck was added to the rubble. \"Take their weapons, if there are any left,\" said a quiet voice. And in the more peaceful city of Louisville, Jay Welch was introduced to Kevin Ilaria\u0027s best friend, his adjutant at Standiford Field. Jay took a liking to Sub-Tribune Jason Rinaldi the moment he felt the fellow\u0027s firm grip. \"Jason is adjutant,\" Ilaria explained. \"And one of the few \u0027field soldiers\u0027 who manages to get along with Caesar\u0027s Pretorian Prefect, Lamberti. How he does it, I don\u0027t know. Lamberti\u0027s absolutely unbearable.\" \"Prejudice. Middle-class prejudices,\" Rinaldi grinned. He was short and very dark with a lot of black hair. Ilaria\u0027s left cheek cracked into a long dimple as he smiled. \"He picks on me because I\u0027m a serious psychologist.\" Rinaldi laughed. \"As a psychologist, Kevin, you\u0027re an excellent bridge player. As a soldier—\" \"Just remember who\u0027s got three bars and who has two.\" Rinaldi waved his hand and shrugged. \"They pass \u0027em out to psych boys wholesale,\" he said, and ducked Ilaria\u0027s swing. \"Slow reflexes, too,\" he added as he turned to go. Ilaria stopped him at the door and murmured a few sentences. Jay caught something about sabotage at Standiford. Rinaldi seemed to be attributing it to the Commanding Officer there. \"Nice guy,\" Jay said as the door closed behind Rinaldi. \"You said it. Good officer, too. He\u0027ll root out the bird who\u0027s playing around out there. Can\u0027t figure out why it\u0027s being done.\" \"Factions,\" Jay said, \"—within factions.\" \"Little ones always exist, I guess. Have you finished with the history films?\" \"I\u0027ve seen them, yes. I\u0027m still trying to digest them.\" \"The language give you much trouble?\" \"Quite a bit, but I think I got most of it. \"One man,\" Jay went on wonderingly. \"One man. A Captain in the Italian Army. \"The Communist forces in Indo-China had been driven back and Captain—then Major—Lollabrigida went in after them. \"The defeat was becoming so terrible that the Kremlin dealt itself a playing hand rather than the dummy it had been playing. Red forces came piling in. Lollabrigida and his Italian troops stopped them cold. Then he seemed to sway. And, when the Commies pounced for the kill, they were trapped, pocketed, and annihilated. \"American newspapers and commentators began to call Major Julius Lollabrigida \u0027Julius Caesar.\u0027 Italy became big overnight. The Big Three became Russia, the United States, and Italy. Lollabrigida appealed to America—sometime in there they made him a Colonel, but he was actually telling the Generals and the Italian government what to do—for aid in going ahead aggressively. \"And America turned him down. They were still playing \u0027wait and see.\u0027 They waited. They waited too long. The Commies got tired of waiting around and sent a couple of jet bombers with A-bombs.\" \"Now you\u0027re telling me things,\" Ilaria interrupted. \"I\u0027m pretty shady on that period myself.\" Jay shrugged. \"It was after my time. All I know is what the films show. Two planes, each with a seven-man crew, and each carrying one atomic bomb, were dispatched from an airbase somewhere near Juneau.\" Jay stopped. \"And?\" The man from 1954 choked. It was hard to be objective about this. It wasn\u0027t so easy for him to pass off as the film had done. \"And—\" he hesitated. \"It\u0027s over, Jay. It\u0027s done with. It doesn\u0027t even concern you anymore. It belongs to a past era.\" \"One was headed for New York. The other struck farther inland ... for Washington. The first one was shot down by an F-117 border patrol plane. The other one got through. It—it levelled the capitol. Almost completely. The White House and the Pentagon were destroyed.\" Ilaria sat quietly and waited. Jay didn\u0027t go on. \"Thus removing the United States of America, as such, from a prominent position in the world picture,\" Ilaria said. \"Yes. I can\u0027t understand it. Everything just folded up. SAC didn\u0027t even get off the ground. And Colonel Lollabrigida, by then Commander-in-Chief of the UN forces, sent fifty planes, each with one A-bomb, over the Kremlin. One was shot down over Vladivostok, but the bombardier pulled the firing pin as the ship crashed and most of Vladivostok was destroyed. Six other planes made it to their destinations and dropped their loads. I can\u0027t remember the cities ... one was a new super airbase near Moscow. Five of the planes returned. None had managed to reach Moscow. Half the world was in ruins. The Pope begged that the War be stopped.\" Ilaria snorted. \"He knew they\u0027d hit Rome!\" Jay looked at him. \"Is that what you think?\" Ilaria shrugged and flashed that quick, winning smile. \"There are no other motives, are there?\" Jay stared. What changes had taken place in religious philosophy in this hard-bitten world of 2054? Kevin Ilaria shrugged, smiling. \"That\u0027s unimportant. Let\u0027s go on with the history lesson. Then what?\" \"Uh—oh, yes. As I remember Julius Lollabrigida, to be trite, launched an \u0027all-out offensive\u0027 against Communist forces everywhere. People were afraid of Russia, but they were afraid of Lollabrigida and Rome, too. So they joined him. Aid poured into the UN. Czechoslovakia was taken and Poland and Hungary and finally only the old Russia of pre World War II days was left. And in they went. \"Then Lollabrigida\u0027s saboteurs exploded an atomic bomb in the heart of Moscow. After that it was pretty easy sledding.\" \"Astounding how a nation seems to fall apart when its capitol and its leaders are gone,\" Ilaria remarked. \"Everybody and everything folds,\" Jay said. \"Morale dies. \"After the demolition of Moscow and other parts of the USSR, Italy stood at the top. General of the Armies Julius Lollabrigida marched back into Italy and into Rome and into the capitol and up on a pedestal. He stood as Italy\u0027s utter ruler. His last name was lost and replaced by \u0027Caesar II.\u0027 He was named Dictator. \"From mighty Rome, Caesar sent out linguists and anthropologists and ethnologists and psychologists and military men and others. In twenty years, twenty peaceful years, Italian had become the language of the world. A few minor uprisings in America and in Japan were smashed. Julius Caesar II was World Dictator of the Republic of Earth. Someone in America denied him and was torn to pieces by the people. Someone in Italy spread literature of dissension and was hunted down and liquidated by Caesar\u0027s personal police, the Pretoriani. And so it went. \"Caesar adopted a prominent Air Force Colonel who became Caesar III on Lollabrigida\u0027s death. Each year on his birthday men were silent. No business was transacted. No one left his home. Except blue-and-silver clad soldiers, wearing PR armbands. Caesar\u0027s Pretorians. No one dared venture out. \"During the reign of Caesar III, every person in the world changed his last name to an Italian one. The Ali bens and the Chicos and the Andres and the Fritzes and the Johns became Marianos and Roccos and Caldinis and Campisanos and diManos.\" There was silence for a moment. \"The thing I can\u0027t understand,\" Jay mused, \"is why in all these years there hasn\u0027t been a \u0027bad\u0027 Caesar, or an uprising.\" \"What do you mean by \u0027bad\u0027 Caesar?\" Jay shrugged. \"In the first Pax Romana there was Caligula, who was insane. Nero, who preferred artistic diversions to politics. There was Galba, who didn\u0027t know what was going on. And so on. And on and on. Your three dictators so far seem to have done excellent jobs. They seem to be damned conscientious leaders.\" \"When you re-create something,\" Ilaria told him, \"you try to eliminate its faults.\" \"Of course. But what if Caesar\u0027s son or a Caesar\u0027s adopted son goes bad?\" Jay elucidated. \"So far we haven\u0027t had that problem to deal with. But we\u0027re ready. Each time a new Dictator comes to power, one thousand top military men draw folded pieces of plastipaper from a \u0027bowl.\u0027 On twenty of these are X\u0027s. The others contain O\u0027s. The twenty X\u0027s are a secret organization, sworn to kill the Dictator if it should become necessary. When Caesar, as you say, \u0027goes bad\u0027.\" \"Brilliant!\" Jay breathed. \"And he—Caesar—never knows who they are?\" \"No one ever knows,\" Ilaria said. \"Not even the members. They remain in contact, but none ever knows who the others are.\" Jay remembered Ilaria\u0027s previous mention of the system, and the unconscious swelling of the Tribune\u0027s chest at the time. \"You\u0027re one,\" he said. Ilaria was caught off guard. \"I—yes,\" he said. \"I won\u0027t ask how you knew.\" \"A guess. Then you\u0027ve been a—whatever it\u0027s called—for nine years, during Caesar V\u0027s reign.\" \"That\u0027s right.\" \"And you don\u0027t know any of the others?\" \"Only one. I found out accidentally. He—\" Ilaria stopped. Jay shrugged. \"I won\u0027t ask any more questions along that line,\" he promised. \"But I still can\u0027t believe there haven\u0027t been any uprisings!\" \"None. Caesar II died of a heart attack. Caesar III had a brain tumor which we learned about too late. His son never had a chance to prove himself, other than that he was brave and foolish. He swam the Rubicon at its widest point, then walked to Rome in his shorts in the dead of winter. He died of pneumonia. Caesar V, our Dictator today, is strong and quiet. He holds the Empire firmly unified. But he does nothing extraordinary. And he is too lenient.\" \"I just can\u0027t conceive of such perfection!\" Kevin Ilaria smiled. He walked over to the window and peered out. \"You couldn\u0027t. But this is the perfect government. Everyone is satisfied. One ruler. One capitol. One army. One language. One nationality. One world. One religion.\" \"I realize—\" Jay halted. \"One religion?\" he demanded. \"Yes.\" \"What is it?\" He found himself afraid of the answer. The indications were there, in plain sight. He guessed it before Kevin Ilaria turned from the window and said: \"Caesarism.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/2852/78710.html","bookId":1214,"book":{"id":1214,"title":"And Gone Tomorrow","description":"简介： Here is the best story submitted in answer to the theme question: What Will Life in America Be Like 100 Years From Now? ...
