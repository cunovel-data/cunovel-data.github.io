And so I woo’d Fan Willoughby— A maiden like a dove, And so I won Fan Willoughby— The maiden of my love; And though sad years have pass’d since that, And she is in the sky, I never, never can forget Sweet Fanny Willoughby.","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/duanpian/3071/84868.html","bookId":983,"book":{"id":983,"title":"The Yale Literary Magazine","description":"简介： As I am about to have some little converse with thee, I cannot pass this first bright page of our Magazine, without a greeting word, and a Gods benison on our acquaintanceship.
