Vlad growled and struck my guard savagely across the face. Adem was thrown back from the blow, but he quickly recovered and rose to his feet. Again, he slashed at the apparition, but his blade was useless against the specter. Vlad laughed at Adem’s futile attempts before tossing him away.\n Hands tightening around my throat, Vlad hissed at me, “Release me.”\n Magda surged forward, her hand thrust out before her. I suffered the rosary before I saw it dangling in her fingers. The light emanating from it was like fire washing over me and I screamed in pain. She slashed the cross through the apparition of her former master and Vlad howled in agony before vanishing.\n Violently convulsing, I flung out my hands toward the cross. I could feel its power burning my hands. Magda was rooted in fear and did not immediately recognize my distress.\n It was Adem that snatched the cross and threw it across the room. “It is hurting her, too!”\n Immediately, I was released from its power and lay panting on the floor.\n “How was he here?” Magda cried out. “He is not dead! How can his ghost attack us?”\n “It’s his spirit. It is wandering the earth and it has found her,” Adem answered grimly. He fell to the floor beside me and swept me up into his arms. Smoothing my hair back from my face with one hand, he reached out to Magda with the other. She wrapped her arms about both of us and we clung to each other.\n “How?” Magda whispered.\n “Black magicks.” I was trembling with fright and the words came out in a choked sob.\n Magda gasped. “Ignatius told me we must find you a protective talisman, but I did not know why. Forgive me! He told me to take you to a gypsy fortuneteller as soon as he was gone.”\n “Do not feel guilty, Magda,” I urged her. “We were all a bit overwhelmed and not ourselves last night.”\n “I am not certain where we will find someone who can help you,” Magda continued. “I suppose there may be someone in Pesth.”\n “I would not advise going to the gypsies unless you are certain they are not charlatans.” Adem’s voice was heavy with worry.\n Trembling, I rubbed my hand over my throat. It was painful to the touch. “I must do something. This was the most powerful he has ever been when attacking me. Ignatius told me he was afraid that Vlad was finding a way to feed from me. I believe he is right. I must find a way to stop Vlad from taking any more of my power. Should he rise...”\n Magda pulled at her dark black hair and wound it around her fingers nervously. Her expression was tormented and tears slid over her cheeks. “We must do something, Adem. I cannot bear it if he rises.”\n “I agree. We must stop whatever he is doing to the countess.” Adem’s strong, rough hand smoothed my hair back from my face. “Countess, you must heal yourself.”\n “Feed from me,” Magda offered.\n “Only a few sips.” I bent my head over her wrist and bit into her willing flesh.\n Adem stroked my hair as I fed. It was a soothing sensation. I felt loved and cared for as Magda’s sweet blood renewed me and healed my bruised throat. Licking her wound then my lips, I sat back and peered into the gloom of my room. Vlad did not dwell in the shadows, but I feared he would return.\n Suddenly, I remembered something Laura had said. “Maria regularly consults with a fortuneteller! Laura says she is quite impressive. Sir Stephan does not like that his wife brings her into their home, but indulges her. Ever since Laura’s younger brother died, Maria tries to speak to him from beyond the grave.”\n “Excellent!” Adem pressed me into Magda’s arms and stood swiftly. “I will go there immediately and have them summon the fortuneteller to their home. I do not want the gypsies coming here. Gypsies sometimes serve the undead, but oftentimes they hunt them.”\n “Agreed! Please arrange for a consultation tonight. If I do not act soon, I fear what Vlad may be capable of!”\n Adem nodded briskly, then turned and strode out of the room.\n Magda helped me to my feet and led me over to the bed. My cosmetics smeared the floor and the room still smelled of powder.\n “Are you and Adem at peace?” I dared.\n “We are hoping to find it soon,” she replied. She fussed with the paper twists in my hair and wiped the powder from my face with the edge of her robe.\n “Magda, if his wife no longer loves him, does it really matter if he takes you as a lover?”\n My maid smiled ruefully and rubbed my cheek a little harder. “He is a man of honor. I have no doubt that he loves me, but he still honors her.”\n “Have you seen her?”\n “Yes. I did not know who she was then. She is beautiful. But she is also cruel. When I saw her she was in the arms of another man and did not care that Adem was in her presence.”\n “The corruption of the haven,” I murmured.\n “Yes.” Magda finished cleaning my face and tucked my hair back from my neck. I could see her relief that I was healed. “I thought he would tear your head from your shoulders.”\n “As did I.”\n “I am sorry I hurt you with my rosary. I shall take it from the room.”\n “Why did you bring it?” It wounded me to think she was afraid of me and kept it for protection.\n “Now that I am no longer bound to Vlad, I have returned to my church. I carry it with me to pray. I always make sure to keep it from your sight.” She paused and her dark eyes regarded me with worry. “Do you wish for me to no longer attend?”\n “No, no!” I shook my head adamantly. “Please, continue. Pray for me. Perhaps God will hear your prayers on my behalf.”\n Smiling slightly, she touched my hands. “I will. I promise. Should I stay with you?”\n “Could you?” I yawned as I fell back on my bed. “I must sleep. The sun makes me so very drowsy.”\n “I will. If he returns, I will use the rosary upon him again.” Her dark eyes flashed with defiance. “He will not touch you.”\n “Thank you, dearest Magda,” I whispered as I closed my eyes.\n Vlad did not return.\n Later-\n I was relieved to leave the Dosza Palace behind as the carriage wove its way down the lane toward Sir Stephan’s home. The Baroness was still sleeping when I departed, which was fortunate since I had yet to decide what sort of tale I should tell her about the destruction in my bedroom. Meanwhile, Magda set about arranging the move to another suite. I was saddened to leave my beautiful blue rooms, but Vlad’s attack had destroyed its serene aura.\n Dressed in a pale pink dress with tiny red beads and thick ivory lace adorning the petticoats, I felt a bit more poised than earlier. My mother always said that a lady should dress her part despite how she was feeling. I understand her wisdom now. Once I am properly coiffed and dressed, I feel empowered to be Countess Dracula, even though the name is loathsome.\n Adem traveled with me in the carriage while our guards rode behind. In the darkness, I felt safe and hidden away from spying eyes. Even now, despite Vlad’s violent intrusion into my life, I was aware of all that I had learned from Ignatius and Astir. Ilinca and Gavril could be nearby watching my journey to Sir Stephan’s home.\n Upon our arrival, Adem quickly leaped out of the carriage and flipped down the steps so I could disembark. I had scarcely set my foot upon the ground, when the door to the manor opened and Sir Stephan himself appeared. His thin face revealed his distaste for me far more than it should have. He would never treat me in this manner if Vlad were about, but I would rather deal with Sir Stephan being inhospitable than have Dracula return.\n “Countess Dracula, good evening,” he said in greeting, leaning down to kiss my hand.\n “Thank you for assisting me in this matter.” I withdrew my hand quickly and entered his home. Sir Stephan followed, his breath a little ragged. I suspected he was holding back his anger.\n “I do not understand why you would be in need of a fortuneteller. My wife is a desperate woman who misses her child. Certainly you are not trying to reach your family from beyond the grave?” Deep furrows formed on his brow and about his mouth as he regarded me with both contempt and fear.\n “Why I need the fortuneteller is none of your concern. Must I remind you that your job is to do as my husband and I say?” I lifted my brows at him and was satisfied when his face flushed.\n “You know that I am ever at your disposal,” he reluctantly responded.\n “I know we pay you handsomely and you do a satisfactory job. My husband is pleased with your work. I hope you will continue in that same vein and not disappoint him.” I was rather pleased with myself. I have grown quite adept at manipulation of late. Certainly Vlad would be proud and though the thought makes me a little bitter it is also a comfort that I am adapting to my new nature.\n A maid assisted me with my coat and bonnet, her downcast eyes and pinched expression revealing much about the atmosphere in the house. I could feel the tension filling the halls and knew I was responsible. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vengeance-of-the-vampire-bride-vampire-bride-2/page-42.html","bookId":2615,"book":{"id":2615,"title":"The Vengeance of the Vampire Bride (Vampire Bride #2)","description":"Storyline: \n The Vengeance of the Vampire Bride (Vampire Bride #2) \n In THE TALE OF THE VAMPIRE BRIDE, Lady Glynis suffered great horrors at the hands of her evil vampire master, Count Vlad Dracula, and vowed she would one day escape him. \n In THE VENGEANCE OF THE VAMPIRE BRIDE, Glynis learns to embrace the title of Countess Dracula as she sets into motion her plans to seek revenge on those who betrayed Glynis and her family to Dracula and to reunite with the man she loves. \n Despite her ambitions, it soon becomes quite apparent that her life continues to be overshadowed by the ominous presence of Vlad Dracula. \n Set in the 1820s against the lush gothic backdrop of Buda, Hungary, the tale of one vampire bride’s quest for love, revenge, and the right to determine her own way in life is a sweeping saga that will enthrall any reader who loves the beautiful, deadly vampires of old.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-vengeance-of-the-vampire-bride-vampire-bride-2.jpg","author":"Rhiannon Frater","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-vengeance-of-the-vampire-bride-vampire-bride-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:46:07 PM"}}
