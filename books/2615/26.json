Besides, I have missed Buda in my absence,” I answered truthfully.\\n\\n “And your dear husband, is he well?” she asked as the tea tray was brought in by a servant. Her voice was calm, but her dark eyes were keen.\\n\\n Gracing her with a smile, I answered, “He is consumed with matters concerning our country estate.”\\n\\n “Will he be joining you soon?” Sir Stephan asked, his voice slightly quavering.\\n\\n With a light shrug, I settled more comfortably upon the couch. “I dare not speak for him. I only know he desired for me to return and deal with matters here.”\\n\\n All three of the adult mortals paused in their movements for the shortest of moments. I could see their bodies tense as the Baroness busied herself with serving the tea.\\n\\n “Of course, I shall assist you in whatever is required of me,” Sir Stephan promised.\\n\\n “And I am always and forever your dear friend. Whatever I can do in service I shall do readily,” the Baroness said with a wide smile.\\n\\n I balanced my teacup upon its saucer and returned her smile. “My husband would expect nothing less.”\\n\\n Maria quickly occupied herself in preparing her tea, her eyes downcast with worry. I could discern from the expression upon Laura’s face that she knew something was amiss with those around her. With delicate ease, she sipped her tea and nibbled on a small cake, her eyes studying the Baroness.\\n\\n “He has always been such a dear friend.” The Baroness reclined in her chair, her movements sensual and casual despite the slight tension about her eyes. “I remember well when I first met him. I thought to myself he was the most formidable creature I had ever beheld.”\\n\\n Laura smothered a titter by drinking her tea. My gaze met hers and I felt immediately that we were conspirators.\\n\\n “He does have the aura of a warrior of old,” Maria agreed.\\n\\n “A man who expects to be obeyed,” Stephan added.\\n\\n “And shall be! Always!” The Baroness ate a biscuit with relish, her eyes sparkling.\\n\\n I was amused at how desperate they were to set me at ease and assure me of their devotion to Count Dracula. I had no doubt that they would wish to placate him since I had concocted my plan to move back to Buda and into their good graces. I needed their devotion to Vlad to manipulate them into doing my will.\\n\\n “I will make certain to relay that information in my correspondence.” For Laura’s sake, I pretended to sip my tea and peck at my cake. I liked her much more than her simpering parents and had no desire to expose her to my true nature. I would spare her, but not her parents. My plans would need to be altered in order to spare her the emotional trauma I had endured. I would not kill Sir Stephan and Maria, but I would find a way to inflict my vengeance upon them.\\n\\n The Baroness set aside her cup and leaned toward me. “I am simply thrilled that you are once more in our presence! We had such little time to converse when you were last in the city, before the tragedy of your home burning! Oh, it has caused such concern among your peers, I can assure you. All sorts of rumors have been flitting about! One rumor even suggested that Vlad’s own servants burned his home!”\\n\\n “Or that some disgruntled peasants from Pesth came across the river to burn down the homes of the wealthy,” Sir Stephan added.\\n\\n “Truly?” I supposed I should not find it extraordinary that Vlad’s contemporaries in human society would anticipate the worst of circumstances surrounding the destruction of his manor. “As far as I know it was a candle that set it aflame.”\\n\\n “Such a tragedy! It was such a lovely home. You will be rebuilding, will you not?”\\n\\n “My dear Baroness, of course! Vlad has many plans and I assure you he will be rebuilding,” I replied.\\n\\n “Despite his plans to move to England?” Sir Stephan asked, daring to meet my eyes.\\n\\n “Of course. Do you truly believe he would leave his homeland for such a long period of time? We shall be traveling to and fro, I can assure you.” I realized I would have to be careful in making my own plans appear to be part of some greater scheme concocted by Vlad Dracula. He had been considerably persistent in his desire to move to England. I was still unsure as to why he had been so determined to do so. Though it pained me to admit it even to myself, I was adrift in a sea of uncertainty. It was already becoming quite clear that I was lost in Vlad’s dark world. I would have to tread cautiously. Considering my very nature, I had to accept that I was at a disadvantage.\\n\\n “Time can be an enemy,” Maria mused.\\n\\n A vampire’s eternal youth and immortality would always put Vlad at a disadvantage. Even if he had succeeded in entering English society, at some point we would be forced to leave for another country.\\n\\n “My husband is always planning ahead. Even years, decades in advance,” I agreed, snatching upon her comment with relief. Impulsively, I plunged onward. “We have even discussed Vienna.”\\n\\n Sir Stephan grew still, but his cup trembled upon its saucer. His hand quavering, he set it down quickly.\\n\\n “Ah, Vienna. The center of all power in the empire,” the Baroness remarked dismissively.\\n\\n They were unsettled and I realized I had once again made a mistake.\\n\\n “He does so love a challenge,” I insisted.\\n\\n “Quite true,” Sir Stephan agreed daring to raise his eyes to regard me.\\n\\n Laura took another small bite of her cake and watched her father curiously.\\n\\n “As do I!” The Baroness stood and flung out her hands dramatically. “I shall throw a grand party to welcome the Countess to Buda once more. It shall be fabulous! And it will give our dear little Laura the opportunity to catch the eye of a dashing eligible man.”\\n\\n “I really would rather not,” Laura said softly.\\n\\n “Oh, but there are so many! Buda is bursting with young men from all over the empire.” The Baroness’ eyes shone with gleeful anticipation. I was rather impressed with her. Either she was a great performer or a person who did not dwell on the uncomfortable aspects of life.\\n\\n This comment did not appear to impress Laura in any way whatsoever. She set down her tea cup and stared at it morosely.\\n\\n I took her hand. “You can keep me company at the party. We shall have a grand time.”\\n\\n Laura graced me with a relieved smile. “I would like that.”\\n\\n Maria touched her husband’s hand. “It is late now. We should depart. I’m certain you are both weary after your travels.”\\n\\n It was quite evident that the thought of her daughter befriending me disquieted Maria.\\n\\n The Baroness and I were soon left alone in the parlor. Silence filled the room.\\n\\n I set my teacup and saucer on the tray and fastened my gaze to the Baroness’ form. Her gaiety vanished and she pursed her lips slightly.\\n\\n “Has he truly forgiven us?” she asked at last.\\n\\n “Of course. You know how he can be. Temperamental. Mercurial.” I shrugged slightly.\\n\\n “And you?”\\n\\n I slowly dragged my fingers along the arm of the couch as I considered my words before speaking. “I am still devastated by the deaths of my family, but I am now graced with immortality and power.”\\n\\n A small smile wavered upon her red lips. “A painful balance of the scales.”\\n\\n “Yes,” I agreed. “It is a curse and a blessing.”\\n\\n “He does love you,” the Baroness said passionately. “He is enraptured with you completely.”\\n\\n “I know you’re his mistress,” I said, deliberately unsettling her.\\n\\n Her chin trembled with fear as she sat back, her eyes riveted to her hands folded upon her lap. “Before your marriage.”\\n\\n “And after. I am not a simple girl. At the castle there are other women, you know. The Brides of Dracula.”\\n\\n “You have his title,” she pointed out, “and his love. He is a worldly man of earthly desires. He will have other women, but you are Countess Dracula. I can only hope to one day be your sister Bride.”\\n\\n “Why do you think me special?” I asked her, curious.\\n\\n “Because he told me so,” she answered, pain leaking into her words. I understood in that moment that she had hoped to be his countess, but had been rebuffed. “He had desired an English bride for his move to that country. But after a time, he told me that he planned to make you his wife in all ways.”\\n\\n I had witnessed a secret moment between Vlad and the Baroness. I knew the words he had spoken to her and her anger when she believed he loved me. “We shall be sister Brides,” I said at last.\\n\\n “You are the first among them,” she said in a soft, thoughtful tone.\\n\\n “Perhaps, but we both know that his lusts are powerful. He still desires you,” I continued, lying. Vlad had been done with the Baroness. Her worth to him had been nullified as far as he was concerned. But she was valuable to me and, therefore, she must believe that she was still of value in the eyes of Vlad Dracula.\\n\\n She let out a soft gasp full of emotion. Eyes sparkling with tears, she reached out to clutch my hand. “I only want to serve him. When he grew angry with me...”\\n\\n “His anger has passed. You know his moods. He can be quite loving one moment and so very cruel the next. Do not be afraid anymore. My very presence here must be an assurance to you that you are not removed from his favor.” \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vengeance-of-the-vampire-bride-vampire-bride-2/page-26.html","bookId":2615,"book":{"id":2615,"title":"The Vengeance of the Vampire Bride (Vampire Bride #2)","description":"Storyline: The Vengeance of the Vampire Bride (Vampire Bride #2) \\n In THE TALE OF THE VAMPIRE BRIDE, Lady Glynis suffered great horrors at the hands of her evil vampire master, Count Vlad Dracula, and vowed she would one day escape him. \\n In THE VENGEANCE OF THE VAMPIRE BRIDE, Glynis learns to embrace the title of Countess Dracula as she sets into motion her plans to seek revenge on those who betrayed Glynis and her family to Dracula and to reunite with the man she loves. \\n Despite her ambitions, it soon becomes quite apparent that her life continues to be overshadowed by the ominous presence of Vlad Dracula. \\n Set in the 1820s against the lush gothic backdrop of Buda, Hungary, the tale of one vampire bride’s quest for love, revenge, and the right to determine her own way in life is a sweeping saga that will enthrall any reader who loves the beautiful, deadly vampires of old.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-vengeance-of-the-vampire-bride-vampire-bride-2.jpg","author":"Rhiannon Frater","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-vengeance-of-the-vampire-bride-vampire-bride-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:46:07 PM"}}
