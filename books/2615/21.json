She can’t help herself,” I said peevishly. “I will not be feeding from her and she knows it.” With her hand pressed to her stinging cheek, Katya sulked. Even in the gloom I could see the tears glimmering in her eyes. Magda sat back in her seat, but did not remove her gaze from the young blond woman. She did not have to utter words for me to know she disapproved of Katya. The driver of the carriage barked out an order and the carriage swerved. I grabbed hold of the safety strap to keep myself from falling to the floor as Katya let out a cry. The carriage left the road, wheels clattering onto cobblestones. Peering out the window, I saw we were pulling up to an inn. The building was several stories tall with a peaked roof and plain walls painted golden yellow. Lights burned in the windows and the front door swung open as the carriage approached. An unusually tall figure stepped out of the doorway and several men followed behind. “Astir,” I breathed with relief. I had truly thought I had seen the last of him on this journey. If there were unknown enemies pursuing us, I felt safer with the fallen angel at my side. I had seen him impressively wield his powers against a dhamphir. “Very dangerous roads,” I heard one of the men saying to Astir. “That is why I rode ahead to make sure I could find a safe haven for my wife,” Astir replied. The carriage clattered to a stop, and the horses whinnied as it rocked back and forth. Katya peeked out of the window as Magda collected my traveling case. Two young men hurried to open the carriage door and lower the step. They were clad in simple white shirts and trousers, but their matching waistcoats were ornately embroidered along the hem. “Come, come,” one of them said. “Excuse me,” Astir said, reaching past them. “Darling, let us get inside where it is safe.” “The gypsies are not to be trusted,” the rotund man at Astir’s side declared. I was inclined to believe he was the innkeeper by the way he motioned for the other two men to gather our bags. I took hold of Astir’s hand and he helped me down. He wrapped his arm possessively about my shoulders and escorted me quickly across the courtyard to the doorway of the inn. “I’m so glad you got here safely, darling. The guards did well protecting you,” Astir said, lightly squeezing my shoulder. “I am so glad you found us shelter.” Magda and Katya trailed behind us as the proprietor hurried ahead down a narrow hallway that led past a small parlor and dining room. “Please come down and eat a good dinner once you have freshened up. My wife is a very good cook,” he said. “Wadim, my wife is considerably delicate and the journey has tired her,” Astir answered. “Could you send a meal to our room?” “Yes, of course! I will see to it immediately!” Wadim scampered away as his men brought in our traveling cases. I played along with Astir, leaning heavily against him as we hurried up the narrow stairway to the floors above. There was an urgency about him that unsettled me. It occurred to me that I had not seen Adem and the guards when we had arrived at the inn. The room we entered was plain with white walls, a simple bed with a colorfully embroidered coverlet, a dressing table and chair, and small wardrobe. “Sit,” Astir ordered, hurrying to the window. “What is wrong?” I demanded as Magda shut the door. Katya promptly sat on the bed, pouting. Magda tugged her off and shoved her toward the chair. “We are being followed,” Astir responded. “Adem made the same proclamation. Who is following us?” I perched on the edge of the bed and tugged off my gloves. Astir stood near the window, watching the road. The moonlight played along his curls making them glint like gold. His eyes were once more fires within his lovely face. “There may be more than one band of men following us. The first I suspect is led by Katya’s dear father.” “I am not going back with him!” Katya cried out. “Oh, be quiet, silly girl,” Magda snapped. “The Mistress will do with you as she pleases.” Astir threw a dangerous look in Katya’s direction, and she fell into obedient silence. “And the second group?” “My dear countess, the other may be much more dangerous.” “Who is it?” I demanded. “Uncertain. But there are many who dislike your husband, so it could be one of his foes. Or, it could merely be bandits or gypsies desiring to rob us.” He shrugged. “It is best to be cautious in this land. It is a dangerous country.” “But you are more than mortal. Why should we fear? I can see you are afraid by the set of your shoulders,” I pointed out. Astir leaned against the wall, folded his arms over his chest, and gazed upon me with amusement. “I don’t fear for myself. I fear for your delicate little self. Despite all your power, you do not know how to control it and use it to defend yourself. At least, not yet. Therefore, I must see to your immediate safety.” “I am learning to fight,” I answered defensively. Of course, I had packed my daggers instead of wearing them for the sake of comfort on the long journey. I now realized the folly of this action. If we were not being pursued by mere mortals, but more dangerous creatures, the daggers would be a good defense. “Yes, so I was told.” There were heavy footsteps upon the stairs and Astir strode swiftly to the doorway. His eyes blazed for an instant, then he wrenched it open. Adem hurriedly stepped inside. “The men that followed us for most of today were Katya’s father and men in his employ. Enre witnessed Toma meeting with a second group of men he could not identify. Toma was given money and turned back. The strangers - three men - continued on. Enre followed them until just after nightfall when they were joined by another man. A man who appeared in the blink of an eye.” I gasped in fear. I remembered far too well the dhamphir vampire hunter who had inflicted terrible pain upon me when he had tried to kill me in Buda, who was able to shroud himself in darkness like a vampire. “Did Enre recognize the mysterious newcomer?” Astir demanded. “He did not. But he also described the men as wearing black cloaks and hats that hid their faces.” Astir’s mouth tensed, but he did not speak. “They will be here shortly,” Adem said, his gaze straying to me. “We must protect her.” “I will meet with them and determine if they are a threat,” Astir decided. “We do not want to be hasty and insult one of the powers that be.” A ruckus outside the door startled us. Adem quickly drew his sword. “They’re here!” Astir drew himself up to his full height, his eyes burning fires. Magda and Katya rushed to my side. Holding their hands, I retreated to the corner near the window. The door burst open and Enre was hurled across the room into the far wall. He moaned with pain as Magda and Katya rushed to him. A dark figure stepped into the room clad entirely in black, a wide-brimmed hat obscuring its face. For a moment, I feared it was Vlad, but the man tilted his chin and I saw a meaty, swarthy face beneath the brim. “Where is Vlad Dracula?” the stranger demanded in a gravelly voice. Astir stepped forward, his height imposing and his features fiercely set in a scowl. “How dare you burst in! This is uncalled for!” “Where is Vlad Dracula?” the man repeated. “He is not here,” I said, finding my voice. The glowing red eyes of the man narrowed upon me. “Countess Dracula?” “I am Countess Dracula. Who are you?” My voice was raw with anger and fear. I longed for my silver daggers as I stared at the man filling the doorway with his menacing presence. Adem and Astir stood between us, yet the man gave them no notice. His thick lips turned up slightly as he regarded me. “I am Chamuka of House Baatar,” the man growled, his gloved hand drawing a wickedly curved blade from his belt. The significance of this introduction was lost to me, but I saw Astir and Adem exchange a quick glance. “You have no business here.” Astir stepped directly before me. “I have come to strike off the head of he who betrayed my Master. But if he is not here, her head will do.” Chamuka lunged forward, his blade arcing downward. Adem swept forward, his sword clanking against metal. I gasped as two dark forms hurtled through the window. One of the figures darted toward me, a dagger in hand. Instinctively, I dodged under the sweep of the blade and shoved my attacker off his feet. The third assailant had lunged toward Magda, Katya and Enre, but was now a burning pillar of fire. I was startled by this quick turn of events. Through the flames I saw Enre pressing Magda and Katya against the wall to protect them from the flailing man as he dashed himself against the bed, setting it aflame. Astir grabbed my attacker and flung him through the window as Adem continued to battle Chamuka. Astir plucked the burning man from the floor and tossed him after his companion. Flames licked up along the walls and I shrank back toward the window in fear. Astir stretched out a long arm and grasped hold of me.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vengeance-of-the-vampire-bride-vampire-bride-2/page-21.html","bookId":2615,"book":{"id":2615,"title":"The Vengeance of the Vampire Bride (Vampire Bride #2)","description":"Storyline: The Vengeance of the Vampire Bride (Vampire Bride #2) In THE TALE OF THE VAMPIRE BRIDE, Lady Glynis suffered great horrors at the hands of her evil vampire master, Count Vlad Dracula, and vowed she would one day escape him.
