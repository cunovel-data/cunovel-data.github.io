Now I know that he served a vampire and did terrible things. I killed them both because I will not have them ruin my new life with you. Am I not your daughter now? Child of your blood?”\\n\\n “Yes, you are.”\\n\\n Smiling, she kissed my lips softly. It was a chaste kiss, but full of her love for me. Despite my unease, I returned the gesture. My power surged into her and claimed her. I felt my blood call to hers and bind us firmly together. I took her hand and pressed it to my bosom. “I shall care for you as Vlad never cared for me.”\\n\\n Sobbing with relief, she clung to me.\\n\\n Chapter 27\\n\\n The Journal of Countess Dracula\\n\\n November 28, 1820\\n\\n The Dosza Palace\\n\\n I am struggling to set the pen to paper tonight. I am overwhelmed with the events that have transpired, yet I feel I must record all that has happened. Though my heart is glad that Laura is once more among us, I am saddened by the acts she committed in her madness. I have been shaken to my core, and I am struggling to regain my equilibrium.\\n\\n It was tedious dealing with the aftermath of Laura’s rampage. I had to drink from the servants in Sir Stephan’s home to restore my powers before placing false memories in their minds. Meanwhile, Adem ransacked the house to make it appear as though criminals had broken in and murdered Sir Stephan and his wife. Like thieves, we carried off jewels and other valuables and hid them in one of the moldering coffins in the mausoleum where Laura had been laid to rest.\\n\\n Percy was safe where I had left him when we returned, but nearly frozen. I planted more lies within his mind before Adem returned him to his flat. I spirited Laura back to the palace by air, nearly draining myself of all my power. I was exhausted and Magda helped me bathe Laura and get her properly dressed. Once she was cleaned up and clad in one of my nightgowns, she did not look like the murderous vampire who had claimed three lives. She looked young and innocent. Her expression broke my heart. She looked completely content with the state of things.\\n\\n Not daring to leave Laura with Magda, I trembled with my hunger while I waited for Adem to return from his errand.\\n\\n For Laura,” Adem announced, escorting Katya into my rooms. “Astir says you must take her. It’s your payment to him for Enre’s death.”\\n\\n Katya smiled at me triumphantly, while Laura regarded her with curious eyes.\\n\\n “I thought we had seen the last of tonight’s tragedies. I see I was wrong,” I sniffed.\\n\\n Adem cast a dark look at Laura as she curled up in a chair and regarded us with great interest. “All is complicated now by what has transpired. Astir has agreed to help us. Of course, there will be further payment on your part for his assistance.”\\n\\n Sighing, I ran my hands over my face with distress. “Is nothing simple anymore?”\\n\\n “Apparently not.” Adem shoved Katya onto the sofa. “I have to attend to Enre’s burial. I will return later.”\\n\\n “Adem, I am so sorry about Enre,” I said, raising my hand to his shoulder.\\n\\n He drew out of the range of my touch, his scarred face tormented by his sorrow. “As am I.”\\n\\n “I am sorry, too.” Laura’s voice was timid and soft. We both turned toward her. She combed her fingers through her long damp hair as she stared at us with her large doe-eyes. “I am sorry. Truly. I know what I did was terrible and wrong, but in that moment I had no control over my new nature.”\\n\\n “I understand, but that does not take away the sting of loss,” Adem answered.\\n\\n Ducking her head, Laura lowered her eyes.\\n\\n “You will be fine with her?” Adem asked me.\\n\\n “Yes. I am famished, but I can feed off of Katya.”\\n\\n Katya grinned, her eyes fastened upon me as her fingers played with her golden hair.\\n\\n “Katya can sleep in my room. I shall sleep upon the sofa when I return in the morning. I suggest you keep Laura with you.”\\n\\n Nodding my head, I followed him to the entrance to my suite. “Thank you, Adem.”\\n\\n His eyes strayed to Magda. My maid was standing just within the doorway to my bedroom. “Keep her safe from Laura.”\\n\\n “I will not hurt her,” Laura snapped.\\n\\n “See that you do not,” Adem said, and was gone.\\n\\n “Give me your wrist,” I ordered Katya.\\n\\n She coyly tucked her head to one side, offering her neck.\\n\\n Magda stormed toward her. “Do not defy the mistress!”\\n\\n Katya pouted and thrust out her arm. I sat beside her and bit into her wrist. I heard Laura gasp and I used the last tendrils of my power to hold her still. I could hear Laura’s rapidly beating heart in her chest: a heart beating with the blood of her dead parents. I did not let my mind linger long on those thoughts. I drank quickly and only enough to extinguish the worst of my hunger pangs.\\n\\n Leaning back, I licked Katya’s warm blood from my lips. I could feel her life feeding into mine, renewing me. My strength had not yet fully returned, but the worst of my hunger was gone. Katya rewarded me with a sulky look as she watched her wrist heal.\\n\\n “Do not offer yourself to her,” I instructed, pointing at Laura who was watching us with soulful eyes. “She does not have full control over herself yet and she could kill you.”\\n\\n “Not on purpose,” Laura protested.\\n\\n “Even if you did not do it on purpose, she would be dead nonetheless.”\\n\\n Both young women regarded me with hurt in their eyes, but both nodded nonetheless.\\n\\n “Laura, you will not feed unless I am with you until I am certain that you have your wits about you. Katya, I place you under Magda’s instruction. You will heed her words, or I will send you back to your father.”\\n\\n Any protest that had hovered upon Katya’s lips was squashed away by the firm pressing of her lips together upon hearing my final threat. I knew Katya would want to stay near the vampires she craved so much. And if I knew anything at all about young women is that once they lived a life free of their father’s rule they would not be keen to return to his control.\\n\\n Standing, I pressed my hands against my bosom, feeling the dull thud of my own heartbeat. “We must be wise. We must be careful. All has become perilous so very quickly. Laura, you must always do as I say. I am your Mistress and you will obey me, if not by your will, but by my power. I do not wish to coerce you in any way, so I beg of you to listen to my hard-won wisdom.”\\n\\n Laura threw herself into my arms, clinging to me. “I love you! I would never do anything to hurt you! You are my mother vampire now! You are my family, Glynis! I love no one more than you!”\\n\\n Holding her, I pressed kisses against her cheek. “I love you, Laura. I will do all I can to assure you are safe in this dark world we must now inhabit. But you must obey me.”\\n\\n “I killed them for both of us. Truly,” she said, her large eyes seeming quite innocent.\\n\\n Yet, I could not forget how she had appeared as she stood in the hallway drenched in the blood of her parents. I had craved vengeance against Sir Stephan, but not like this. Never like this.\\n\\n I lifted my eyes to see Magda staring at me with sadness in her eyes. She knew as well as I that there would be difficult times ahead.\\n\\n At last, I lay down with Laura in my bed and held her close as we prepared to sleep through the day. Holding my new vampire fledgling, I longed for Ignatius. As I fumbled my way through this treacherous world, I was making mistakes that I feared could be the end of all of us. If only Vlad had been a true Master and taught me about the world of the vampires, my powers, and how to exist among the supernaturals of the city. Instead, he had used me to suit his own selfish needs and now I was adrift. If Ignatius would return at least he could guide me. I must not fail Laura as Vlad failed me.\\n\\n As I drifted off to sleep, a thought flitted through my mind that was comforting, yet terrifying.\\n\\n I am now a mother.\\n\\n Later-\\n\\n “What is this?”\\n\\n The voice was a howl of despair and it roused me from my slumber. Forcing open my eyes, I saw Csilla standing over the bed. Her beautiful refined features were twisted into an angry scowl. She staggered back from the bed as if she had been struck.\\n\\n Instinctively, I knew the sun was high in the sky and could feel its power dragging at my limbs. With great effort, I lifted myself up by my elbow, and I stared at her inquisitively. She must have slipped into my bedroom when she realized Adem was not guarding the door.\\n\\n “Why are you here, Csilla?” I asked, my voice thick with sleep.\\n\\n “I heard the news of Sir Stephan’s demise! The entire city is in an uproar.” She gripped the back of the chair set next to my mirrorless vanity and steadied herself. Face flushed with emotion, she looked disheveled and a bit wild. Tangled curls of dark hair fell around her shoulders and over her heaving chest. Clad only in her dressing gown, she was too pale and appeared sickly.\\n\\n I did not answer her, but waited for her to continue. Laura lay beside me, deeply asleep. There was no hiding her new nature from the baroness.\\n\\n Thrusting out an accusing finger, she continued, “I also heard that his daughter was found alive in the mausoleum, screaming for help, by our own dear Percy! That her illness had only rendered her senseless and not truly dead. The city is abuzz with the tragedy and the terrible ordeal poor Laura endured! Poor sweet angel returned to life only to discover her parents are dead!” \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vengeance-of-the-vampire-bride-vampire-bride-2/page-55.html","bookId":2615,"book":{"id":2615,"title":"The Vengeance of the Vampire Bride (Vampire Bride #2)","description":"Storyline: The Vengeance of the Vampire Bride (Vampire Bride #2) \\n In THE TALE OF THE VAMPIRE BRIDE, Lady Glynis suffered great horrors at the hands of her evil vampire master, Count Vlad Dracula, and vowed she would one day escape him. \\n In THE VENGEANCE OF THE VAMPIRE BRIDE, Glynis learns to embrace the title of Countess Dracula as she sets into motion her plans to seek revenge on those who betrayed Glynis and her family to Dracula and to reunite with the man she loves. \\n Despite her ambitions, it soon becomes quite apparent that her life continues to be overshadowed by the ominous presence of Vlad Dracula. \\n Set in the 1820s against the lush gothic backdrop of Buda, Hungary, the tale of one vampire bride’s quest for love, revenge, and the right to determine her own way in life is a sweeping saga that will enthrall any reader who loves the beautiful, deadly vampires of old.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-vengeance-of-the-vampire-bride-vampire-bride-2.jpg","author":"Rhiannon Frater","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-vengeance-of-the-vampire-bride-vampire-bride-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:46:07 PM"}}
