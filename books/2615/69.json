Let us be honest with one another.”\n “I love her. I want her to live. And though you are a cruel, merciless tyrant, I believe you love her, too, in your own perverse way. And despite the very bad blood between us, I cannot believe you would allow Gavril and Ilinca to kill one of your Brides. In truth, I think you would be proud of her for not only vanquishing you, but surviving without you while a vampire war waged about her. She is a remarkably strong woman.”\n “She committed adultery with you. That is enough reason for me to kill her.” He dismissed my argument with a shrug.\n “She is the keeper of your power,” I reminded him.\n “Give me time and I shall be more powerful than before.”\n “You need her in your plans, do you not?”\n “I will find another young English aristocrat.” He smirked. “She is disposable. I do not care if she lives or dies. But I do thank you for freeing me. Well done, brother.”\n I struggled to restrain my temper as I strode after him up the stairs into the depths of the castle. “You cannot let her die.”\n “She attacked me, drained me, and left me to cavort about Buda with you. Her death is her just reward for such actions,” Vlad said with a dark laugh.\n “You will let her die. The most powerful of all your Brides?” I was aghast.\n He nodded. “Well, yes.”\n “I see.” I understood in that moment I had failed. I could see it in his eyes and I was filled with sorrow. “Very well.”\n We walked in silence until we reached the great hall where his throne sat. Looking about, he shook his head. “Those simple foolish Brides of mine.” He kicked one of the many dead bodies out of his way. “Gluttonous fools.”\n “I shall leave you to deal with them,” I said at last.\n “I thank you for reviving me. Such a pleasure to once more be among the living...” he kicked another emaciated body out of his way, “...and the dead.” Reaching his throne, he laid his hand upon the long golden stake that rested against it. “Ignatius, Ignatius, when I think of your dashed hopes it is almost as delicious as the thought of you impaled upon this stake.”\n “Good evening,” I said in a cold tone and turned to leave. Hearing the whistle of the wind slashed by the stake flung at me, I easily stepped aside. It punched through the door before me. I turned, bowed, and departed.\n As I hurried across the bridge, leaving the castle grounds, I found myself nearly walking into the desk in Astir’s office. He sat behind it, sipping the wine. Shaking the snow from my cloak, I glanced over my shoulder to see that the castle no longer loomed over me. I was looking at a painting upon a wall instead.\n “No need to ask how that went,” Astir said, then flung back his head and laughed.\n Letter from Father Ignatius to the Immortal Beloved of Vienna continued...\n My beloved Mistress, I apologize for what I must do now. I will have to kill every vampire in Buda to free Glynis. I see no other way. I know you will seek justice and my death will be inevitable. I just ask that you spare Glynis, the woman of my heart and dreams.\n Your most faithful servant,\n Father Ignatius\n Chapter 33\n The Journal of Countess Dracula\n December 6, 1820\n Buda\n I have been allowed to change into more formal attire. Magda wept as she delivered the clothing to me and kissed my hands as her tears fell upon my palms. I held her against me, humbled by her affection, and kissed her cheek when she departed. Alone, I dressed in the fine pale pink gown with the delicate ice blue ribbons and beading. I did not attempt to put up my hair, but instead let it fall to my waist. Wearing the cursed wedding ring and my cameo from Percy, I awaited my fate.\n Though I love Ignatius deeply and believe he will do all he can to save me, I am afraid. Perhaps this is my just judgment for all I have done. I have killed and committed cruel acts. I am no longer human and stand outside of nature and God’s blessing.\n Yet, I find myself without remorse. I have experienced life in a way I never imagined. I have loved fully and completely. Ignatius is my soul. Laura is my heart. I was blessed by the loving friendship of Percy and comforted by the companionship I found in Magda and Adem. I have lost much, but I have also gained such beautiful treasures in the darkness of the night.\n I am not content to die tonight, but I will face my accuser knowing that every action I have taken since the night I fled the castle has been by my own choice.\n “Take care with the step,” Jenci’s said as he guided me.\n Blindfolded, I was led by the hand by Rebekah, the vampire with the white hair. We traversed a series of winding stairs then walked down long hallways. I heard other footfalls and voices in the distance, but could not discern where I was being led. When I was bundled into a carriage and transported across the city, I was surprised. Yet, it only seems wise that Gavril and Ilinca would have multiple havens.\n After a short journey, we departed the carriage and strolled through the icy slush. When we entered the warmth of a new haven, Rebekah removed the blindfold. She did not touch the silver bands that secured my hands.\n I was standing in a great hall of marble with a chandelier sparkling overhead. I recognized this new place as the home of Borbála. This was confirmed when she pranced out of a doorway and laughed with delight as she rushed over to me.\n “How exciting! A trial in my home! I wish I could tell everyone, but alas, I cannot!” Her cruel eyes relished my situation and I considered striking her. Instead, I stood still as she carefully removed the silver bonds from my wrists.\n Jenci pushed her aside and she frowned at him fiercely. He ignored it and took my arm once again. Rebekah placed her hand upon my shoulder and they guided me down the hall to a grand ballroom illuminated with red candles.\n The House of Gavril was gathered to observe my trial. They were seated in chairs arranged around a dais were two ornate chairs were set up as thrones. Ilinca and Gavril were already settled upon them.\n I saw Ignatius and Laura seated near the front of the rows. Laura’s eyes were red from crying and she gave me a sweet smile, trying to reassure me. Ignatius’s face was an impassive mask. I feared that whatever plan he had tried to set in motion to rescue me had failed. As Jenci escorted me past Ignatius, he stood quickly. I leaned toward him and our lips met for a mere second before I was pushed on.\n I was seated to the right side of the thrones. Across from me sat Cneajna. She was smiling at me with cruel satisfaction. She was clad in a modern gown of ivory with gold accents. Like mine, her hair remained unfettered. Slowly, she licked her lips, a reminder of when she had licked my blood off them the night she had attempted to kill me. It was a promise that I would die.\n Fighting the impulse to lower my head, I gazed at her steadily. Her smile only widened as she relaxed into her chair.\n I finally allowed my gaze to wander and saw that there were new vampires among the House of Gavril. Rebekah took her seat next to a man I assumed was Izsak, the faithful servant she had asked to turn into a vampire. I spotted Zsa Zsa sitting in the last row, perched on the back of the chair, her feet set upon the seat. In her hand was a long iron pike with a bronze skull impaled at the top. One of the wolf brothers stood behind Cneajna and Ferenc guarded me.\n Jenci shut the doors to the ballroom and hurried down the aisle to the steps leading to the thrones. I allowed myself to look at Ilinca and Gavril at last. They were both solemn tonight, clad in rich black velvet with gold diadems upon their heads. Ilinca’s hand rested upon Gavril’s forearm, her eyes resting on his face. He was a morose figure upon his throne and I feared his judgment would be swift.\n “House of Gavril, Father Ignatius, Lady Laura of House Dracula, we are gathered to hear the accusation by Princess Cneajna of House Dracula against Countess Dracula, Princess of Wallachia.” Jenci’s voice boomed and echoed in the grand room.\n “What is the accusation?” Ilinca asked, though she already knew.\n “State the accusation, Princess Cneajna,” Jenci ordered.\n Cneajna stood, curtsied to the regents, then turned her gaze to me. “Glynis struck down Vlad Dracula so she could steal his blood and power. She murdered him by plunging a stake through his back. She also attacked his Brides and left us to starve. Once I had recovered, I came here to Buda to seek justice.”\n “Let it be noted that Count Vlad Dracula has not been seen in the city of Buda since the last of April this year,” Jenci added. “His absence has been a cause of concern for the House of Gavril for some time, but the regents graciously upheld the treaty they had entered with Count Dracula. Because of that treaty, the House of Gavril is sworn to defend Count Vlad Dracula and his House. Should Countess Dracula be guilty of the murder of her Master, then the treaty must be enforced and her life extinguished.” \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vengeance-of-the-vampire-bride-vampire-bride-2/page-69.html","bookId":2615,"book":{"id":2615,"title":"The Vengeance of the Vampire Bride (Vampire Bride #2)","description":"Storyline: \n The Vengeance of the Vampire Bride (Vampire Bride #2) \n In THE TALE OF THE VAMPIRE BRIDE, Lady Glynis suffered great horrors at the hands of her evil vampire master, Count Vlad Dracula, and vowed she would one day escape him. \n In THE VENGEANCE OF THE VAMPIRE BRIDE, Glynis learns to embrace the title of Countess Dracula as she sets into motion her plans to seek revenge on those who betrayed Glynis and her family to Dracula and to reunite with the man she loves. \n Despite her ambitions, it soon becomes quite apparent that her life continues to be overshadowed by the ominous presence of Vlad Dracula. \n Set in the 1820s against the lush gothic backdrop of Buda, Hungary, the tale of one vampire bride’s quest for love, revenge, and the right to determine her own way in life is a sweeping saga that will enthrall any reader who loves the beautiful, deadly vampires of old.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-vengeance-of-the-vampire-bride-vampire-bride-2.jpg","author":"Rhiannon Frater","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-vengeance-of-the-vampire-bride-vampire-bride-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:46:07 PM"}}
