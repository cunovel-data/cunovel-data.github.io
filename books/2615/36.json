Laura gazed at me in confusion as Csilla tilted her head to one side as she drew closer to me. “Is it a matter of taste? A younger, headier vintage?” My anger unfurled within me as I felt my teeth growing sharp in my mouth. Laura had arrived soon after I had risen and I had yet to feed. My anger and hunger flared to life within me. I clenched my hands as I battled against the need for blood. Csilla’s dark eyes gazed into mine as Laura squirmed around in her chair, clearly uncomfortable. “Adem!” My voice was sharp. He appeared within seconds at the doorway. “Yes, Countess?” “Please escort Laura to her home. The baroness is not well and I best tend to her.” “As you wish,” he responded. Laura hastily gathered her things and cast a worried look in my direction as she departed. “I will call on you later this week,” I said to her, my gaze steadfastly on Csilla. The baroness stood before me defiantly, her eyes challenging me. As the door closed behind Laura and Adem, I gripped Csilla’s arm in such a harsh grip that I knew I was bruising her. “How dare you?” “Why do you drink from the guards and that little girl instead of me?” Csilla’s voice was serpentine: low, hissing, and dangerous. I tossed her away and watched with satisfaction as she fell into the chair across the room. Startled at my abrupt violence, she clung to the armrest, gasping for air. “How dare you endanger me in this way!” I was on her in a second, frightening her with my swiftness. “She does not know what I am, and I do not wish for her to know. I am her friend and she is mine.” “I am more than your friend! I am Vlad’s chosen Bride!” Csilla spat the words out. “Your attentions should be directed at me! My blood should fill your veins, not hers!” “I do not feed from her!” “Then feed from me!” Csilla bared her slim white throat. “Take my blood then!” I should have turned away. I should have slapped her. I should have been so much wiser, but in that moment, my hunger spoke. I seized her and drank furiously from her neck. Her warm arms came about me, holding me as I swallowed down her blood and life. The sound of her blood rushing through my body and my heart flaring to life within my chest was as heady a sensation as the blood filling my mouth. It was only when I felt her arms slacken about me that I remembered not to kill her and pulled my teeth from her neck. She lay in a swoon in her chair. A narrow band of blood streamed over her flesh and stained her bodice. Reluctantly, I licked her wound and it began to heal. As her blood continued to renew my life, I fell to my knees. I shuddered with the pleasure of my body’s renewal, but already I regretted giving into Csilla’s wishes. Magda heeded my silent call and entered the room. One glance at her surroundings quickly revealed what had happened and she hurried to my side. “Have her taken to her room and put to bed. Tell the servants that she drank too much and collapsed,” I ordered, my voice ragged with emotion. Magda nodded and made certain to remove all traces of blood from the baroness’ flesh before hurrying out of the room. Dismayed at my lack of control, I released my body into a blue mist and gave into the lovely sensation of floating. I drifted out of the room and allowed the night wind to carry me further away into the gardens. There I returned to my solid form and lay down among the flowers. Feeling like a foolish child, I gazed up at the night sky through bloodied tears that tainted my world red. Despite Astir’s warnings, I would have to deal with the baroness. She was far more a danger to me than I had realized and needed to be dealt with. I would never make her a vampire, but to kill her outright would cause me untold troubles and possibly endanger me further. As I lay there amidst the gardenias and jasmine, a terrible plot unfurled within my mind. It was so terrible that I felt slightly sickened. I had no doubt that Vlad Dracula would heartily agree with the clever and terrible plan that solidified within my mind. I could have my revenge on Csilla and secure a new level of freedom in such a way that no one would ever suspect me Sitting up, I wiped my eyes and gazed at the Dosza Palace. A smile touched my lips. Chapter 18 The Journal of Countess Dracula October 2, 1820 The Dosza Palace October has come and I have seen neither Astir nor the vampire. She has even ceased to haunt my dreams and my vivid nightmares of Count Dracula have returned. I always waken fearful, gasping, and burning with the dark lust he created in me. How I loathe him. Only my memories of Ignatius alleviate the terror of those dreams. I miss him so terribly and I am afraid. The vampire has not reappeared, but that does not mean she is not watching. Meanwhile, Csilla was so inebriated when I fed from her, she did not truly comprehend that I attacked her out of anger, not blood-lust. I was relieved when she recovered within a few short days and did not appear to think ill of me or the incident. In fact, she seemed happy and enamored with me once again. Since I have now decided her fate, I have made an effort to befriend her. This has made her even more tiresome, but I must endure. “I do love the night,” Csilla sighed beside me. We were seated on the lawn in comfortable chairs gazing down the sloping lawn toward the Danube. The air held a slight but refreshing chill. Autumn was making its presence known and the leaves illuminated by the candles set around us were bright yellows, oranges and reds. Soon many of the trees would have bare limbs and the snow would come. It was difficult to believe that so much time had passed since I had sealed Dracula away in his tomb. A pang of guilt tore at me as I thought of the starving sisters trapped in the castle. “I miss rainy afternoons,” I answered, feeling a bit contrary. “I miss England.” “He will take you there,” she assured me. “He shall take all of us there and you shall show me around London.” Her smile was wide and beautiful, her dark eyes sparkling with merriment. The dark lashes fringing her eyes threw lacy shadows over her cheeks creating an aura of mystery about her. I noted she always seemed to know how to place herself in the light to illuminate her features in the most pleasing way. Even her body was carefully posed to the best effect. “I\u0027ve only been to London a few times.” I wrapped my shawl around my shoulders and swept my gaze over the darkened world. Through the trees I could see lights in the windows of our neighbors’ abodes upon Castle Hill. The sky was clear and I could see the Buda Palace aglow in the night in the far distance. “I think it is much lovelier here.” “Buda has stolen your heart,” Csilla decided. Had it? I realized that yes it had. It was such a lovely city and full of life. It suited my new nature and I felt my spirit was tethered to the city in some way. But yet again, this is where I had found Ignatius and later, my freedom. “London was just so overwhelming. And gray. This city is much more colorful.” Csilla’s smile widened. “I will miss it while we are gone. But you are immortal and I am destined to be and we can come here when we desire. I suppose we shall see all the world at some point. Every city, every country. Grand adventures await us far from here.” My immortality frightened me, but I did not dare share those fears with her. I envied her untainted belief that to be a vampire was a gift, not a curse. I had yet to feel anything but cursed. I was accepting of my nature, yet I was constantly aware of my limitations. The Baroness continued: “Besides, I am looking forward to shopping somewhere other than Váci Street.” I rather liked Váci Street. It was a lovely shopping center filled with boutiques and cafes that I enjoyed visiting with Laura and Percy. A very short distance from the Danube, it was always busy and exciting. “I liked Rome and Venice when we visited. There were beautiful shops there.” I plucked at my skirt and tried to not flee from the Baroness. I was trying so very hard to be companionable, but I found her absolutely abhorrent despite her best efforts to be my friend. “We shall go to them all, you and I. I suppose we will have to educate his other Brides to be more modern.” Her hand rested on mine and her smile was conspiratorial. “Or maybe we can convince him to leave them behind.” “What leads you to believe he would abandon them?” I regarded her curiously. “He is there with them now and I have not seen him for months. Maybe he prefers their company.” Csilla threw back her head and her silvery laugh filled the night. “Oh, come now. Do you really believe he is at the castle? I know him far too well. He is most likely traveling and tending to his many plots. A man such as he can never be still for too long. This land is always rife with political intrigues even beyond the grave.” I smiled slightly and shrugged. “He is doing as he wishes,” I lied. “I shall wait here.” “And it is a joy to have you here.” Shifting her weight so she was leaning over the armrest of her chair, she whispered, “If you are hungry, we can go inside.”","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vengeance-of-the-vampire-bride-vampire-bride-2/page-36.html","bookId":2615,"book":{"id":2615,"title":"The Vengeance of the Vampire Bride (Vampire Bride #2)","description":"Storyline: The Vengeance of the Vampire Bride (Vampire Bride #2) In THE TALE OF THE VAMPIRE BRIDE, Lady Glynis suffered great horrors at the hands of her evil vampire master, Count Vlad Dracula, and vowed she would one day escape him.
