Katya crept closer to Astir and me, curious.\n “Once the snow begins to fall, your world shall start to crumble. Be warned not to do anything hasty or foolish.” Astir’s voice was quiet and ominous.\n Rage filled me as I stared up at the fallen angel. “How dare you come and interrupt my life to say such a thing. All you do is warn and threaten me. Have I not done all you desired?”\n “I’m afraid it has all been for naught,” Astir lamented “for all I see around you is death.”\n “Damn you,” I whispered in a ragged voice. “Damn you.”\n “When the snow starts to fall...” Lady Astir trailed off and she sighed sadly.\n “Countess, we should go!” Maria called out from the front of the store. “It is beginning to snow!”\n Astir gasped, her fingers covering her mouth. “Oh, dear.”\n Furious, I stomped after Maria and out of the store.\n The Journal of Countess Dracula\n November 11, 1820\n The Dosza Palace\n The snow swirled and danced outside the windows as Adem slashed at me with the dagger. Our blades clanked together as I defended myself, then twirled away from him.\n “Your concentration is off,” Adem scolded.\n “Astir’s warning perturbed me!” I attacked, my blade flashing as I aggressively forced him back toward the enormous fireplace in the ballroom. It was the only room that we could effectively practice our fighting skills now that the snow was falling. The cascading snowflakes had not stopped since the snow began several nights before.\n “Which was her intention,” Adem said, effectively deflecting my blows.\n Clutching my daggers in both hands, I circled him slowly. My hair fell loose around my shoulders as I moved. “Why must she aggravate me so?”\n “She has her own ways, as we both know. She does as she wills.” Adem darted forward. I stepped to one side and shoved him off balance. He tumbled a few feet, then, groaning, sat up. “You’re paying attention. Good.” He set his blades aside to rub his bruised ribs.\n Looking down at the knives, I felt angry at the lack of my reflection. The blades glinted in the candlelight, empty of my countenance. “I am so tired of feeling so utterly helpless. I should be able to live my own life and do as I please!” I stomped my foot with frustration.\n Sitting upon the floor, Adem rested his hands against his knees and peered up at me. “I agree, but life is not always so easy. Astir’s warning should not be taken frivolously. I know I did not heed her when she warned me that one day I would regret saving Saadat’s life.”\n “Do you regret it?”\n Adem sighed, shaking his head. “No. Not truly. I would not be here with you, with Magda, if not for the choice I made to save Saadat.”\n “What are you going to do about your marriage to her?”\n Adem ran his hand over his long curls and resignedly shrugged. “Nothing. I spoke with her about Magda and she said she does not care what I do.”\n “And what did Magda say?”\n “I have not told her yet.”\n “Why not?”\n “Because I do not know what I can offer her. I am here because Astir allows it. Should she decide you are no longer in her favor, she will summon me to the haven and I will have to obey. I could not ask Magda to follow me there. I do not even know if Astir would allow it.”\n Sitting upon the floor beside him, I gazed around the vast ballroom. It was beautiful in its ornamentation, yet without the revelers, music and candlelight, it felt like a tomb. “We are trapped, you and I.”\n “I doomed myself. You were doomed by others. Do not forget that. You are an innocent.”\n “I’m killing her slowly,” I confessed. “Every time I drink from her, I take just a little more. She grows weaker as I grow stronger.”\u0027\n “Does it bring you satisfaction?”\n I thought of Csilla’s fading pallor and her growing lethargy. “Yes.”\n His rough hand unexpectedly touched my chin, turning my face toward him. “Be careful. Do not sacrifice what is good within you to quench your anger.”\n Tears flooded my vision as I gazed at him. “My family had no hope once she decided I was to be Vlad’s bride. Their fate was sealed. I still hear my father’s death cry, my sister’s sobs of terror, and see my mother’s desolation. Nothing I do can bring them back to me, but I will avenge them.”\n Withdrawing his hand, Adem inclined his head. “Very well.”\n We sat in silence, side by side, both locked within our own hellish thoughts. The whistling of the wind outside the windows reminded me of the castle. The sisters were trapped there by my own will. I wondered if they had starved down to bones yet, then I forced the thought away, unable to bear my own evil.\n “There you are,” Csilla’s voice echoed around us.\n Glancing over my shoulder I saw her in one of the doorways to the ballroom. She was clad in a simple gown and robe. Her long hair tumbled down around her bosom and she looked pale and sickly. Yet, she was beautiful and compelling in her own way.\n “We were practicing.” I held up my dagger.\n “Odd how Vlad has you learning how to fight like a man,” she mused.\n I slid to my feet and walked to her. “You don’t look well. Perhaps you should sleep.”\n “Sir Stephan is coming tonight. He has drawn up papers declaring that when I die, you are my sole inheritor.” She laughed slightly. “When I die, I will be your eternal sister. The money will serve us both well then, won’t it? And Vlad shall be satisfied of my loyalty.”\n Impulsively, I touched her cheek and she cradled my hand against her fevered flesh. Her dark eyes gazed into mine with great yearning. “I will love you forever and do whatever you desire.”\n “Vlad will be pleased,” I lied. I kissed her forehead, feeling the heightened warmth of her skin.\n Together we walked to the parlor where Sir Stephan would meet with us. He was leery of her decision to make me her sole inheritor, but would not deny her request. As we strolled through the long hallways, Csilla shivered. The freezing weather outside was seeping into the palace. Though flames raged in all the fireplaces and every candle was lit, the glowing warmth of the fires did not quite push away the worst of the cold.\n Once seated in the parlor, she rested her head on my shoulder, her fingers wrapped around mine. “When will Vlad return to us?”\n “I do not know. He comes and goes as he pleases.”\n “I dream of him often. He calls to me, but I can never find him.”\n Her words startled me. “Does he?”\n “Yes. He calls to me and I search for him, but I always find you. Not him.” Shifting her head, she gazed up at me. “What does it mean?”\n “That I will be your mistress. You will belong to me and he will see that your love for him is true.”\n “Will you love me once I am your sister?” Csilla wondered, her eyes searching my face.\n “Why do you think I don’t love you now?” I wrapped her up in my arms, playfully kissing her cheek.\n “You love Laura more. I can see it.”\n “Now, now. Laura is my dear friend. Nothing more. You are my future sister of the blood. A future Bride of Dracula.”\n “No.” She shook her head. “I am your future Bride. You will make me a vampire and I will be yours. I wonder if you will love me then.” Tucking her head under my chin, she clutched my hand tighter.\n I was startled by her words and their implication. Then I comforted myself with the thought she would never be a vampire and I would soon be done with her.\n Brice appeared at the open door. “Madam, Sir Stephan is here to see you.” His clipped tones and pale face worried me. I had hardly exchanged a word with him since my arrival at the palace. He was elusive and I feared he believed I was in consort with the Baroness.\n “Bring him in,” Csilla said, gesturing with one hand. Sitting up, she drew her robe tighter about her and fussed with her shawl.\n Sir Stephan entered the room and was clearly startled by her appearance.\n “I am not feeling well today. Forgive my attire,” she said, beckoning him to a chair next to her.\n Sitting down, he set his case upon his knees and regarded us with some trepidation. “Baroness, I am concerned. The papers you asked me to draw up and your appearance compel me to wonder whether you are in good health.”\n Csilla smiled at him sensually and her gaze flicked toward me briefly. “I am well enough to know that should I die my dear Countess should inherit my worldly goods. I have no children, no husband, no family. At least no family beyond the countess.” \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vengeance-of-the-vampire-bride-vampire-bride-2/page-49.html","bookId":2615,"book":{"id":2615,"title":"The Vengeance of the Vampire Bride (Vampire Bride #2)","description":"Storyline: \n The Vengeance of the Vampire Bride (Vampire Bride #2) \n In THE TALE OF THE VAMPIRE BRIDE, Lady Glynis suffered great horrors at the hands of her evil vampire master, Count Vlad Dracula, and vowed she would one day escape him. \n In THE VENGEANCE OF THE VAMPIRE BRIDE, Glynis learns to embrace the title of Countess Dracula as she sets into motion her plans to seek revenge on those who betrayed Glynis and her family to Dracula and to reunite with the man she loves. \n Despite her ambitions, it soon becomes quite apparent that her life continues to be overshadowed by the ominous presence of Vlad Dracula. \n Set in the 1820s against the lush gothic backdrop of Buda, Hungary, the tale of one vampire bride’s quest for love, revenge, and the right to determine her own way in life is a sweeping saga that will enthrall any reader who loves the beautiful, deadly vampires of old.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-vengeance-of-the-vampire-bride-vampire-bride-2.jpg","author":"Rhiannon Frater","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-vengeance-of-the-vampire-bride-vampire-bride-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:46:07 PM"}}
