Gathering up my lace shawl, I prepared to disembark. Pressing away my anger, I focused my thoughts on that which I needed from Astir. It was Adem who swung open the door and quickly unfolded the step. Tucking my hand into his, I allowed him to help me down. Sweet, lovely music wafted on the night breeze. It was a delicate melody that enraptured me. Following the song, I entered the cafe. Inside, the atmosphere was just as lovely as the music. The furniture was dark wood that gleamed with a fine polish under the candlelight. The windows were covered in lush dark red drapes and the air was thick with the fragrance of wax, food, tea, and coffee. Customers clustered around the tables, laughing, chatting, or listening to the musicians tucked into a corner. A few glanced in my direction, but most continued on in their activities without a second thought to the woman with red hair. It was a relief. For too many days I had been the center of attention and speculation, and now I was merely another customer among many. The host escorted me to a secluded table per my request. The candles burned brilliantly in the chandelier above as I took my seat. Astir was nowhere to be seen, but it did not surprise me that he would allow me to be seated first. He had a certain penchant for the grand entrance. I had just ordered a coffee when I saw the wait-staff rushing to the front of the cafe in great excitement. I soon saw why. Astir swept past the tables in grand fashion clad in a black and white gown of the finest silk and organza with an utterly atrocious turban of white satin adorned with feathers, jewels, and ribbons. His hair was arranged in the most recent fashionable style with grand golden curls, braids and rolls. A black beaded shawl was about his shoulders and as I gazed at him, I suddenly recognized him as a woman and not a man. Astir was a handsome woman with a slight masculinity to her features. I was awestruck. “Dear God in Heaven, it is warm. Open some windows!” Astir waved an ostrich fan at the host. “I’m simply sweltering!” “Of course, madam!” was the immediate response and several waiters hastened to obey. All eyes were on Astir as she strode elegantly toward my table. I looked sharply at Adem to see he was unaffected by this great change in Astir’s attire and apparent gender. “Countess Dracula! How lovely you look!” Astir greeted me with swift pecks on the cheek. “It’s so dreadfully warm in here. Atrocious! We must get more air! The night is so lovely!” I could not help but gaze upon the fallen angel preening in her beautiful gown and fluffing up her skirts. All eyes were on her and she smiled mischievously at a young man as he raised his glass to her. “How lovely to see you, Lady Astir,” I said, almost choking on the words. “I’m so sorry I could not join you at an earlier date, but there is so much drama going about! You know how it is,” she said with a wink. A crystal glass of champagne was set before her and she smiled graciously at the waiter. “Stop staring, darling. You mouth is hanging open,” she chided me, reaching out to gently raise my chin so my lips would come together. Her glove smelled like jasmine and was soft against my flesh. “You have changed a bit since I saw you last,” I ventured. “Oh, I know,” she admitted, fanning herself. “But that is what one must do to keep those around them on their toes.” Leaning forward, I said in a softer tone, “Truly, Astir? Is this what this is all about? To make people uneasy when they are around you?” “Au contraire, my darling one. People are not so on edge around a beautiful woman as they are when about a tall, imposing man.” Astir smiled sweetly. “Sometimes events warrant that I take on a more delicate persona. Besides, I look fabulous, don’t I?” “Despite you being a man dressed as a woman, I suppose,” I said snappishly, disturbed at how easily Astir had become a woman in my eyes. “I am neither, yet I am both,” Astir corrected. “Therefore, I can dress as I please. Ah, look at your pout. Coming from such a worldly woman. Perhaps I should kiss it and make it better!” I glowered at her. “Don’t you dare!” Astir threw back her head and laughed. She was beautiful in that moment with the diamonds in her jewelry sparkling against her creamy skin. I was surprised to feel afraid. “I do so like you,” Astir said with vehemence. “So very much.” “Then if you like me so much, why did it take you so long to respond to my request for a visit?” “Oh, that!” Astir waved her fan. “I was dealing with...as I said...drama.” “Does it concern the man who assaulted us on our return to Buda?” Rolling her eyes, she dismissed my words with the flick of her fan. “That is very old and boring news.” “Is it really?” “Of course! I don’t understand why you wish to prattle on over such a minor event.” “Then what sort of drama has consumed you?” I could not fathom what was afoot at this time with the vampire hunters gone from the city and apparently Vlad’s assassin being of no consequence. Then a thought occurred to me. “Katya? Is she causing trouble?” Astir snorted with contempt. “Of course! She hasn’t stopped complaining that she wants to be with you. The haven does not have a vampire presence at this time due to all the trouble with the vampire hunters so all she does is mope about. It’s considerably annoying.” I laughed with delight at the thought of someone annoying Astir as much as she annoys me. The tension I had felt from her unexpected appearance alleviated and I took a small sip of the coffee that had been set before me. It tasted dreadful. Astir raised her eyes heavenward as I giggled. “Oh, I am so very pleased you are amused. You brought the scourge of Katya upon me.” “Actually, your guard did. Not all are as wise as Adem. Enre certainly proved that to be true. Astir’s expression grew sly as she glanced at Adem who lingered at a nearby table. “Oh, he is not so wise at times. I could tell a tale or two about our dear little Adem.” I bristled at Astir’s mocking tone and regarded her coldly. She laughed at my petulance and took another long sip of champagne. “Oh, dear. Do you have your eye set on our dear Adem?” “Heavens no!” I said, aghast. “My heart belongs to Ignatius!” Her sea green eyes sparkled with merriment as she slipped her hands free of her gloves. “How divine! You truly do love our dear Father Ignatius, do you not?” “Of course!” I scowled at her, my sluggish heart beating in my chest with anger and desire. How I wanted to hold Ignatius in my arms and speak to him. I craved him as I did blood, with every aspect of my essence. “So that is why you summoned me?” Astir tucked her gloves away and set her very pale, slim fingers upon mine. “Is that it, dear one?” I supposed she expected me to shirk away from her touch, but instead I gripped those too-long, dry fingers with my own. “Yes. I have considered your warning about Ignatius learning about Vlad’s fate, and I do not believe he would betray me to his Mistress. He loves me. He will protect me.” “Are you so certain?” Astir lifted one slim brow. “I am certain. Though your warning has some merit, I do not believe he would ever betray me. There are conversations you were not privy to, and, upon reflection, I believe he will stand at my side.” With a slight roll of her shoulders, Astir turned her attention toward Adem. “Love can destroy, you know. Even when it does not intend to.” “I do not give your words merit where they have none,” I retorted as I clutched her hand fiercely. “I implore you. Now, tell me. Where is he? What do you know?” Astir’s eyes flicked down to our clutched hands, and she slightly quirked the corner of her thin mouth. “Well, aren’t we a tad desperate?” “I love him. You know this. You even helped keep our affair a secret from Vlad. Now tell me...” Astir withdrew her hand and lightly patted mine before drawing herself up and sitting primly in her chair. She cast her gaze toward the open windows and appeared to contemplate her response. “Vienna. With his Mistress. At least, that is what his last correspondence indicated.” I slightly inclined my head. “Thank you. I wish to send him a letter. Can you arrange this?” “I would advise against it,” Astir answered, all traces of gaiety gone from her demeanor. “I told you! He will not betray me. Why do you thwart me?” Shifting about in her chair, Astir looked slightly uncomfortable. “There is much afoot in the city of Buda that you are not privy to at this time.” “Then tell me!” “Oh, I dare not, for I cannot intercede were you to act foolishly. It is best you do not know and keep to your promise to behave yourself.” Astir sipped her champagne and once more appeared to be weighing her words before speaking. “Then tell me so I will not act foolishly! Does this have to do with my husband?”","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vengeance-of-the-vampire-bride-vampire-bride-2/page-28.html","bookId":2615,"book":{"id":2615,"title":"The Vengeance of the Vampire Bride (Vampire Bride #2)","description":"Storyline: The Vengeance of the Vampire Bride (Vampire Bride #2) In THE TALE OF THE VAMPIRE BRIDE, Lady Glynis suffered great horrors at the hands of her evil vampire master, Count Vlad Dracula, and vowed she would one day escape him.
