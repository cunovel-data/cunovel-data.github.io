Soon I would begin taking much longer draughts.\\n\\n Her warm fingers gripped mine tightly and her eyes were full of yearning. I thought of Laura’s question about Csilla’s seduction of men and women. I wondered if she was attempting to seduce me.\\n\\n “Countess Dracula! Baroness Dosza! Here you are!”\\n\\n I leaped to my feet at the sound of Percy’s voice and clapped my hands joyously. He strode down the lawn toward us, hat in hand, grinning. The moonlight glinted off his gold hair and he looked quite dashing.\\n\\n “Percy! You’re have returned!” I rushed up to greet him.\\n\\n “It was a marvelous trip! A success. I gave a bolt of the most beautiful blue silk I have ever seen to Magda. It will make you a lovely dress.”\\n\\n I kissed his cheek and clung to his arm as we walked back to where the Baroness was waiting. Despite my hatred of the woman, I had to admit she was a striking creature with her creamy white skin and dark hair. She had ceased in her attempt to seduce Percy, believing him to be my lover, but she still greeted him with a seductive smile and lingering kiss on the cheek.\\n\\n “Where did you go? What did you see?” Taking our seats, I felt relieved at his presence. With Percy I felt mortal and alive. It was a wonderful feeling.\\n\\n “I actually traveled to Vienna to broker a new trading contract.”\\n\\n “I was there once! It’s lovely!” Csilla sipped some red wine and grinned. “Full of mad musicians and desperate poets.”\\n\\n “It is most definitely a city of music. I have had the honor of hearing some beautiful music while visiting. I rather enjoy Ludwig Van Beethoven’s works. I was once invited to hear him play at the home of a business associate. It was breathtaking.” Percy poured himself a bit of wine and slouched down in his chair to relax.\\n\\n I had fallen silent while they spoke. Vienna was the home of the Mistress of both Vlad and Ignatius. I felt a pain deep within me at the thought of Ignatius being so far from me.\\n\\n Csilla and Percy chatted back and forth, discussing various composers. I listened, but did not really pay attention to their words. I dread concerts, not being fond of music as a whole. I rarely hear anything I truly like. I once took voice lessons, but my voice is not remarkable. My piano lessons were a catastrophe that often ended in my teacher shouting at me while I banged away on the wrong keys. I do enjoy operas if they are filled with costumes and lovely sets and are not about Vlad Dracula.\\n\\n “…so I was quite pleased,” Percy was saying to Csilla, “to seal such a lucrative contract while listening to such lovely music. If only I could have sealed the music in a box so I could play it for you now.”\\n\\n “It sounds splendid!” Csilla took another sip and I could see that her cheeks were flushed. It would not surprise me if she attempted to seduce Percy again.\\n\\n “And that is where I met the most intriguing fellow. I almost forgot.” Percy rummaged around inside his coat pocket and withdrew a letter. “This is for you, Countess.”\\n\\n Startled, I took the envelope from him and studied the seal. The blue wax had an eye imprinted upon it. “Who is it from?”\\n\\n “Well, he said he knows you and your husband well. Father Ignatius is his name. I met him while I was attending a party thrown by one of my business associates.”\\n\\n I gasped and stared at the letter in shock. The eye represented the first letter of his name, of course!\\n\\n “He was a very interesting man to speak to. He knows so much of the history of this part of Europe and actually suggested locations for my future trips to acquire new textiles.”\\n\\n “I know Father Ignatius,” Csilla said. “He sometimes attends parties here in Buda when he is visiting. An odd man, to say the least. So handsome. Pity he is such a pious priest.” Thoughtfully, she turned her gaze toward me. “Did you meet him through your husband?”\\n\\n “They are acquaintances,” I answered, avoiding a direct answer. I tried not to clutch the letter to my bosom or rip it open. I laid it upon my lap and covered it with a trembling hand. “He also made friends with my brother, Earl Wright, when he was visiting.”\\n\\n Percy’s gaze was also upon me, and I brightly smiled at him in an attempt to hide my excitement. “Tell us more about your visit!”\\n\\n “Would you like to read your letter first? Father Ignatius said it was about a personal matter he had counseled you about when he was in Buda.” Percy’s eyes studied me. His look was sharp though his tone casual.\\n\\n “It is not important. I shall open it later,” I said with a gay laugh.\\n\\n The next two hours were the most difficult I have ever had to endure. I held the letter in my hand, my fingers tracing over the seal, but not breaking it. It was difficult not to rip it open and read the letter within, but I resisted the temptation.\\n\\n It was not until after Percy had departed and I escaped Csilla’s company, that I was at last able to retreat to my suite. Adem and Magda were talking when I entered and fell silent when they saw my face. The bolt of blue silk was set upon a chair. The blue perfectly matched my eyes. It was a lovely gift and I would have to remind myself to send Percy a thank you card.\\n\\n “Is something amiss?” Adem asked.\\n\\n Beside him, Magda was smiling slightly.\\n\\n “I have a letter from Ignatius. He sent it with Percy.” I held it against my bosom with a trembling hand. I strode past them to my bedroom. I could feel their eyes upon me as I closed the door behind me.\\n\\n Sitting upon the edge of my bed, I stared down at the small envelope, tears filling my eyes. I lifted it to my nose and under the scent of Percy’s cologne I could faintly smell Ignatius. Pressing my lips together, I gently eased the envelope open, careful to not completely break the seal. Sliding out the letter, I tried not to spill my tears upon it. Unfolding the thick paper, I saw Ignatius’s strong, quick strokes spilling across the page.\\n\\n Dearest Glynis,\\n\\n My heart is quite weary and I must write this quickly. Words cannot fully express my deep despair that I am not at your side at this most dangerous of times. It is my understanding that you are in Buda without Vlad Dracula and this concerns me greatly. If the rumors are true, you may be in great peril. Astir assures me that he is protecting you and keeping you from harm, but this gives me very little comfort when I cannot be with you.\\n\\n I shall do everything within my power to return to you and be at your side.\\n\\n I love you deeply. Do not doubt that.\\n\\n We shall see each other soon. I promise.\\n\\n Love always,\\n\\n Ignatius\\n\\n “When?” I whispered. “When will you return?”\\n\\n “Now,” Ignatius’s voice whispered. His hand closed about mine as his lips touched my cheek.\\n\\n The letter slipped from my fingers. “Ignatius!” I gasped when I realized he was standing beside me.\\n\\n “I am here, Glynis,” he said, drawing me to my feet.\\n\\n I raised my face and his lips met mine. His hair fell around my face as I lifted my hand to rest against his cheek. Our kiss was sweet and full of yearning, yet gentle. Drawing back, he smiled at me, his dark blue eyes gleaming with pleasure.\\n\\n “You’re here!” I gasped, my palms pressed against his cheeks. It was almost impossible to believe he was finally with me again.\\n\\n “I am here,” Ignatius assured me. “I am not a phantom. I am truly here in flesh and blood.” He appeared just as I remembered: hair as black as raven feathers fell around a long face with a strong nose and finely shaped mouth. His tall, lean form was clad all in black, and his long, white fingers tenderly pulled my hands from his face so he could kiss my palms. “I could not bear to be away any longer.”\\n\\n My breath left me as I felt my heart stuttering within my bosom. Tears fell down my cheeks to stain my dress, but I did not care. Words had left me and I could only cry with joy.\\n\\n Drawing me into his arms, he kissed me again and again. My love for him burned bright within me, illuminating my tattered spirit. All my anger, bitterness, fears, and darkness were swept away by his love. I no longer felt alone, but complete. The taste of his lips and tongue were exquisite and the strength of his body comforting. I slid my fingers into his silky hair and clung to him as we kissed. He swept me about in circles in his arms, as joyous as I to be reunited.\\n\\n Tangled in my petticoats, I giggled against his lips.\\n\\n Ignatius laughed as he saw me kicking my feet in a futile attempt to free myself from my predicament. The heavy lace and embroidery were wrapped about my ankles like a vise. Setting me down on the bed, he leaned down to carefully untangle the skirts, straightening out the hems and patting them into place.\\n\\n Another reminder of his wonderful nature.\\n\\n “Where have you been?” I asked, my lips still burning from his kisses and joy filling my heart.\\n\\n “Vienna, with the Mistress,” he answered as he removed my slippers. He gently folded my dress and petticoats over my legs and his fingers began to undo my garters. “Just as the letter said.”\\n\\n “Why send the letter then come yourself?” Reclining on the pillows, I watched as he slowly rolled my silk stockings down the length of my leg. His fingertips were cool against my skin and I felt my body stirring with desire. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vengeance-of-the-vampire-bride-vampire-bride-2/page-37.html","bookId":2615,"book":{"id":2615,"title":"The Vengeance of the Vampire Bride (Vampire Bride #2)","description":"Storyline: The Vengeance of the Vampire Bride (Vampire Bride #2) \\n In THE TALE OF THE VAMPIRE BRIDE, Lady Glynis suffered great horrors at the hands of her evil vampire master, Count Vlad Dracula, and vowed she would one day escape him. \\n In THE VENGEANCE OF THE VAMPIRE BRIDE, Glynis learns to embrace the title of Countess Dracula as she sets into motion her plans to seek revenge on those who betrayed Glynis and her family to Dracula and to reunite with the man she loves. \\n Despite her ambitions, it soon becomes quite apparent that her life continues to be overshadowed by the ominous presence of Vlad Dracula. \\n Set in the 1820s against the lush gothic backdrop of Buda, Hungary, the tale of one vampire bride’s quest for love, revenge, and the right to determine her own way in life is a sweeping saga that will enthrall any reader who loves the beautiful, deadly vampires of old.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-vengeance-of-the-vampire-bride-vampire-bride-2.jpg","author":"Rhiannon Frater","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-vengeance-of-the-vampire-bride-vampire-bride-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:46:07 PM"}}
