I had hoped to guide you and train you to use your powers during our journey, but it seems that it is not to be.”\n “I do not understand what is happening!”\n “An explanation awaits you in another time,” he answered.\n Behind him, I saw Enre leap over the burning bed to join Adem in his assault against the hulking vampire. Chamuka growled in anger as he swung his weapon, his teeth bared to reveal great long fangs.\n Astir pulled me close. “Don’t be afraid. All shall be revealed in time.” With great flourish, he spun me about before releasing my hand.\n I gasped as I found myself standing before the gates that opened to the Dracula Estate in Buda. Stumbling forward, I wrapped my hands around the cold iron bars and stared up at the ornate bronze\n D welded to the gate. Raising my gaze higher, I saw the stars twinkling above pale gray clouds hovering over the city. Behind me I heard a gasp, then a shrill scream raked through the tranquility of the night. Whipping about, I saw Katya collapse to the ground, still shrieking. Magda’s shocked expression gave way to exasperation and she flung herself at the girl.\n “Silence!” she ordered, clutching Katya’s shoulders and shaking her. “We are safe now!”\n My gait was unsteady as I approached them. I had experienced Astir’s power to deliver me from his haven to my home before, but I was shaken to the core by the great distance he had transported me. To suddenly be in Buda and before the burned remains of the home I had shared with Vlad Dracula was a shock to my senses.\n “Where is Astir?” I wondered. “And the others?”\n “Battling that creature, I suppose.” Magda coughed. The smell of the fire still clung to our clothing and the two mortal women were covered in perspiration from the heat.\n I was stunned by the attack upon us. That Vlad would have such vicious enemies did not surprise me, but I had never considered that my own life could be in peril due to his dealings. I chastised myself for not being properly armed, but I was a bit proud of how I had deflected the attack against me.\n Warily, I examined our surroundings. We were alone in the darkened street with no sign of Astir, Adem, the guards or our belongings. I was relieved when Katya’s screams were reduced to mere whimpering. My nerves had the best of me and I could not endure her screams. The soft murmuring of the wind through the creaking limbs of the oak trees was a familiar and comforting sound. How often had I strolled with my dear brother, Andrew, under these same trees listening to the night birds calling out as the insects hummed.\n “We could try to find the haven,” Magda suggested.\n “No, no. Astir would not want that,” I replied. “It is best if we stay here. I am certain he would not abandon us.” It was a lie, but I did not want Katya to begin screaming again. I was not certain that Magda was as calm as her voice implied for her complexion was quite pale and her eyes were wide with fear.\n The neighing of horses startled us. I pivoted about to see Astir’s carriage emerge from the darkness. The guards rode behind it with Adem in the lead. Behind it followed the horse drawn cart bearing my family’s coffins.\n “Adem!” I exclaimed in relief. “Where is Astir?”\n “Dealing with matters that do not concern you at this time,” Adem answered as he swung off his horse.\n I clutched his arm, gazing up into his scarred face. “We were attacked! I should say that most certainly does concern me!”\n Adem laid a hand over mine and gently squeezed my fingers. “The assassin has been dealt with. His head will be delivered to his enemies and Lord Astir shall deal with the political fallout. For now, Lord Astir wishes for you to continue to your destination and I am to stay at your side until I am certain you are no longer in danger.”\n “Am I in danger?”\n “Chamuka was seeking out Vlad, not you. But it is best that we be on our way.”\n “Will others come after me?\n Adem shook his head. “It has been dealt with. Do not fear. Your husband has many enemies, but Buda is a safe haven for you due to Vlad’s negotiations on your behalf. That is why Astir sent you here. You are safe now in Buda.”\n Unsettled by all the events of the night thus far, I felt suddenly unsure of myself.\n “Countess,” Adem said in a soothing tone “do not be afraid. I shall be at your side.”\n “As will I,” Magda vowed.\n “Enter the carriage and we shall soon arrive at the Dosza Palace,” Adem continued.\n Dropping my hand, I glanced through the trees at the burned remains of the home I had once loved. I had nowhere to go but to the palace to be the guest of Vlad’s whore.\n “Yes, you’re correct. It is time to deal with those who destroyed my family.” Calm and resolved, I entered the carriage and we departed.\n Chapter 12\n The Journal of Countess Dracula\n June 13, 1820\n The Dosza Palace, Buda\n My arrival at the Dosza palace was rather anticlimactic after all that we had endured earlier. Arriving in the dead of night and a week earlier than my anticipated arrival resulted in Baroness Dosza not being in residence. Brice, the baroness\u0027 butler and an Englishman, was awakened and quickly set about ensuring that I would be comfortable in a suite in the palace. I noted he was glad to see me, but also nervous. He did not comment on our disheveled appearance, but escorted me to my rooms.\n “The Baroness instructed the staff to prepare the Blue Suite for your stay before she departed for the countryside to visit an ailing friend. It is lovely and I believe you shall be quite comfortable here,” Brice said in somber tones as he led my small entourage consisting of Magda, Katya and Adem through the gilded hallways of the palace.\n The butler’s crisp English accent was a welcome sound to my ears. It was not so long ago Brice had revealed the truth of his mistress\u0027 complicity in the deaths of my family. I had promised that one day I would rescue him from the Baroness and return him to England. I intended to once I had avenged my family.\n “Blue is my favorite color,” I replied.\n “I believe your husband told the Baroness of your preference before you departed Buda.”\n Though his tone was neutral, his words infuriated me. The Baroness was Vlad’s lover and she was eagerly waiting for him to make her a vampire. I gained great satisfaction in the knowledge that she would never be one of Dracula’s Brides. During my time alone, I had carefully considered every option for vengeance upon her and had finally settled on a plan. In my angrier moments, I admit I had considered merely killing her, but now that I had decided on a course of action against her, I could put aside my anger.\n Two maids walked before us wielding huge candelabra that flung candlelight over the walls, chasing away the shadows. The women suppressed yawns, having been rousted from their beds. Behind me Katya let out several soft exclamations as we strolled past marble statues of gods and goddesses, paintings in ornate frames, and tables adorned with fragrant flowers. I suppose our grand surroundings were a bit overwhelming to a peasant girl.\n After ascending a staircase guarded by white marble sphinxes, we arrived at my new home. Brice opened the door and the maids hurried inside to light the lamps. Entering, I was quite pleased to find a very modern and comfortable set of rooms. All the furnishings were a beautiful shade of pale blue brocade with ivory accents. Standing in the sitting room, I was thrilled to once again be in my true element. I was weary of the inn and the dreary castle. I missed my home in Buda and the rooms the Baroness had selected suited my taste perfectly.\n “Don’t touch anything,” Magda ordered Katya, who promptly glowered.\n Adem began to search through the rooms, opening doors, checking behind the heavy curtains over the tall windows, and about the ornate fireplaces. Brice watched him with curiosity as the maids hurriedly went about their business.\n Magda wore an expression of relief and smiled slightly as we both peered into the bedroom. The canopy bed was beautiful with its gilded posts and heavy velvet and silk draping.\n “It’s lovely,” Magda whispered.\n “I will have to thank the Baroness for such exquisite rooms when she returns,” I said to Brice.\n “She will be pleased to hear that you approve. I know that she put a great amount of effort into preparation,” Brice said in his droll tones. “There is a small room off the bedroom for your maid servant per your request and another room has been set aside for your guard. We were not expecting two maid servants, so perhaps we could have another bed brought in for her.”\n “She will not be staying,” Adem said.\n Katya scowled at him, then turned toward me, her gaze imploring me to let her stay.\n “She is the servant of a friend and will be returned to him shortly,” I said swiftly.\n She pouted and crossed her arms, her chin jutting out stubbornly.\n “I see,” Brice said in such a tone that I wondered if he truly did understand the situation.\n “I have unusual hours if you could inform your staff. I am not to be bothered during the day. I prefer the night. I have a...delicate condition and the sun weakens me.” Brice knew of my true nature, but the two household maids that were turning down my bed and fluffing my pillows most likely did not. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vengeance-of-the-vampire-bride-vampire-bride-2/page-22.html","bookId":2615,"book":{"id":2615,"title":"The Vengeance of the Vampire Bride (Vampire Bride #2)","description":"Storyline: \n The Vengeance of the Vampire Bride (Vampire Bride #2) \n In THE TALE OF THE VAMPIRE BRIDE, Lady Glynis suffered great horrors at the hands of her evil vampire master, Count Vlad Dracula, and vowed she would one day escape him. \n In THE VENGEANCE OF THE VAMPIRE BRIDE, Glynis learns to embrace the title of Countess Dracula as she sets into motion her plans to seek revenge on those who betrayed Glynis and her family to Dracula and to reunite with the man she loves. \n Despite her ambitions, it soon becomes quite apparent that her life continues to be overshadowed by the ominous presence of Vlad Dracula. \n Set in the 1820s against the lush gothic backdrop of Buda, Hungary, the tale of one vampire bride’s quest for love, revenge, and the right to determine her own way in life is a sweeping saga that will enthrall any reader who loves the beautiful, deadly vampires of old.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-vengeance-of-the-vampire-bride-vampire-bride-2.jpg","author":"Rhiannon Frater","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-vengeance-of-the-vampire-bride-vampire-bride-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:46:07 PM"}}
