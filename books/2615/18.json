{"id":99880,"no":18,"title":"Page 18","content":"“Yes, but I do not know if...” Toma faltered, glancing at his daughter. “...if that was the only time they were together. She does lie.” Katya continued her sobbing and wailing. I fought down the urge to cuff her into silence. “Enre does not love her and does not wish to marry her. I will not force him or Katya into a marriage created for the sole purpose of saving you from your own sin,” I said shortly. “Then take her with you.” “No!” Toma’s wife cried out. “Silence, Vanda. Say no more. This sin is yours as well as mine. Once we entered our dealings with the devil, we knew it may come to this.” Vanda looked away, her hands still holding Katya captive. “I have no need of her,” I said at last. “You and your husband have taken her into your rooms and feasted on her so many times she is corrupted. That she should lay with that boy is proof of it!” Toma clutched his thinning hair in his hands, overwhelmed with grief and remorse. I felt nothing but disdain for the man. I had seen his greed whenever I opened my purse. How many times had he bowed to my wishes, or to Vlad’s, and not tried to save Katya from our influence? I knew Katya was corrupted by Vlad, for even I could not control her mind. He had twisted and defiled her and though I often found myself ready to throttle the girl, I felt sorry for her. “Very well then. As payment for my husband’s corruption of your dear daughter, I will take her to Buda with me.” I would not employ her, but I knew that she would find what she craved in Astir’s haven. I felt pity for her as she wailed in her mother’s arms. Vlad had done this and it sickened me. “I thank you, Countess Dracula,” Toma answered in a voice rough with his emotions. He grabbed hold of Katya and pushed her into my arms. “My lady!” She clung to me, burying her face in the folds of my traveling scarf. I pried her hands free and forced her to stand back. “Enough of that.” Trying to please me, she wiped her tears from her face. It was then I saw the triumphant gleam in her eyes. Understanding dawned on me and when I returned my gaze to her parents, I said, “We are leaving now.” “The dowry,” Vanda said, reaching out to grip her husband’s arm. “What is the dowry?” “Yes, Countess. I realize there will be no marriage, but we must-” “I will allow you to live,” I said shortly. “That is your payment.” Shock played over Toma’s expression, then anger gripped him. “You cannot!” “I can. And should you wish to continue to live in safety, I suggest that you stay silent on the matter of your dealings with me and my husband, otherwise the protection my husband granted you is forfeit.” I grabbed hold of Katya’s hand, wrenched open the door, and stormed out of the parlor. Adem and Magda were lingering outside waiting for me. “Madam?” Adem questioned, following with Magda close behind. “She’s coming with us,” I answered grimly. Katya beamed with joy much to my disgust, and I was a bit rough with her as I dragged her along. Her seduction of Enre had been clever. Though I could respect her desire to be free of the parents who were so willing to sell her, I did not like being manipulated. “Lord Astir will not like this,” Adem decided. “Oh, I do not care! His guard was foolish enough to lie with her and cause this trouble,” I grumbled. Astir was settled into the carriage awaiting our arrival. When he saw Katya, he lifted his brows, then began to chuckle. Adem quickly moved to help me ascend the steps into the carriage. “Are you certain?” Adem whispered, his gaze shifting to Katya. As I gathered up my petticoats and allowed him to lift me, I answered, “Of course not. But what else can I do?” Adem inclined his head in agreement, then assisted Magda and Katya as I settled into the seat next to Astir. Closing the door, Adem vanished from view. “How much did you pay Toma for the girl?” Astir inquired. I adjusted my bonnet as Magda untangled my petticoats, dress, and coat, smoothing them around my legs. “Nothing. I allowed him to live and promised to continue Vlad’s protection over him and his business.” Astir laughed with amusement. “Well played. Vlad would be proud.” I bristled under his compliment. “I do not like being blackmailed or deceived.” Seated across from Astir, Katya’s fingers played with the ties of her bodice with her eyes fastened upon me. “Do not play the innocent with me, Katya. I know what you did,” I scolded. “You seduced Enre to force your father’s hand and mine.” She slightly shrugged. “I don’t like it here. I want to be with you. I shall be good.” Magda snorted. “You shall live with Lord Astir,” I replied. Astir gave me a sharp look as Katya pouted. “Your guard was a fool and brought this upon us,” I informed Astir. “If he had not had relations with her, we would not be in this predicament. I think it only fair that you give Katya a position in your household.” “What will I do with her?” Astir regarded her with contempt. The carriage groaned as it lurched forward, the clop of horse hooves against the cobblestones a welcome sound. “Not you. Your patrons. She likes to give her blood,” I explained, then added with some discomfort, “from peculiar parts of her body.” With a sly, seductive little smile, Katya watched me with keen eyes. Astir frowned slightly as he scrutinized the girl’s long limbs, lovely face and golden hair. Now that she wasn’t weeping, she looked pretty, despite her puffy eyes. “Really?” “I offered myself to her,” Katya admitted. Magda cast a disdainful look in Katya’s direction and scooted away from her. “In all ways,” Katya added. I wasn’t exactly certain what Katya’s words meant or entailed, so I decided not to acknowledge her statement. “I know Vlad had...relations with her, as you yourself pointed out,” I reminded Astir. “I miss his kisses,” Katya sighed. I gave her a fierce look, my anger brewing close to the surface. “Enough, Katya!” “Don’t you?” she asked. “And his-” “Enough!” Magda exclaimed irritably. “Obey the Mistress!” Katya cast a dark glare at Magda, then shrugged. The carriage creaked loudly as the horses picked up their gait. The guards on their horses kept pace with us as we wound our way through the town. I did not want to think of Vlad, his kisses or otherwise. I forced my thoughts back to the topic at hand, pointedly ignoring Katya. “Astir, you have many living in your haven who offer blood and more to your clients, do you not?” Shrugging, Astir regarded Katya with more interest than before. “She is a pretty little thing.” “She will fit into your household perfectly. A willing victim.” Katya sighed contentedly. “She’s also a troublemaker, my dear little countess.” “Astir, isn’t that why you enjoy my company?” I countered, smiling at him sweetly. “You’re playing me so well,” Astir commended me, his gloved hand lightly stroking my cheek. “Very well. I’ll take her.” Katya pouted a bit, but I ignored her. “And if she wants to leave to live her own life, you will allow it,” I added. “Should it be for marriage or whatever other reason she may have. I will provide her with some money should she decide to leave. Agreed?” Astir frowned at me. “The things I do to amuse you.” “Promise.” “Very well. You have my vow.” “Meanwhile, I reclaim Magda,” I continued. Magda raised her head and gave me a sweet smile of relief. “Very well,” Astir agreed as he gazed at Katya thoughtfully. Katya was silent, but from the smoldering passion in her eyes as she gazed upon me, I knew that I was not yet done dealing with her. Chapter 10 The Journal of Countess Dracula June 12, 1820 The first night of our journey to Buda passed without incident. Katya fell asleep soon after the conversation waned. Magda remained awake, staring out the window at the darkened landscape with a somber expression upon her countenance. Astir, much to my surprise pulled out a sketchbook and pencil from a leather satchel beneath his seat and began to draw Katya as she slept. I watched his fingers nimbly move over the paper as the image of the girl began to emerge. The fallen angel was undeterred in his sketching despite the rocking of the carriage. When he finished drawing Katya, he began to draw Magda in her repose. By then I was bored, so I pulled out the novel Vlad had purchased for me before our last journey and settled down to read. As night ended and dawn came, the shutters were drawn over the windows. The darkness within the carriage was more opaque than the blackness of the night. I felt sleep tugging on my eyelids and set aside the novel. It was a silly bit of fluff about a young aristocrat attempting to marry an aloof older man. I found it annoying at times, but I easily grew bored during long, grueling journeys and the story was somewhat entertaining. Removing my bonnet, I set it upon my lap so I could rest my head against the back of the seat to sleep.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vengeance-of-the-vampire-bride-vampire-bride-2/page-18.html","bookId":2615,"book":{"id":2615,"title":"The Vengeance of the Vampire Bride (Vampire Bride #2)","description":"Storyline: The Vengeance of the Vampire Bride (Vampire Bride #2) In THE TALE OF THE VAMPIRE BRIDE, Lady Glynis suffered great horrors at the hands of her evil vampire master, Count Vlad Dracula, and vowed she would one day escape him.
