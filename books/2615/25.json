I feel weakened when I feel the bond to him. I feel evil.”\\n\\n “You’re not evil. Not like he is,” Magda assured me. “Never.”\\n\\n At last I lay down on the grand bed and she blew out the candles. After making sure the windows were secure, Magda retired to her room as I settled down to sleep. As my eyes closed, I thought of her story, all I had endured, and vowed I would never be his again.\\n\\n Chapter 13\\n\\n The Journal of Countess Dracula\\n\\n June 15, 1820\\n\\n The Dosza Palace, Buda\\n\\n As anticipated, I have received countless queries from the members of Buda’s high society. The wealthy and titled of the city are undoubtedly intrigued with the scandal of Count Vlad Dracula’s wife visiting his mistress. I have received all manner of invitations: to parties, luncheons, teas, and dinners. There are many letters on thick paper with wax seals extending offers of friendship. I am quite amused, as it is evident that I am causing a stir among my husband’s circle of friends. I sit in my lovely new sitting room sorting through the stack of correspondence feeling amused and delighted.\\n\\n Though there has been no word from the Baroness, Brice assured me that a message has been dispatched and that she will most likely be returning to the palace within a day or so.\\n\\n Shortly after eight o\u0027clock in the evening, I was informed that I had a caller.\\n\\n “Who is it?” I asked Brice.\\n\\n “Sir Stephan, his wife Maria, and their daughter,” he answered. “He just learned of your arrival and is quite anxious to bid you welcome to Buda.”\\n\\n I smirked as I set aside the correspondence. Standing, I pulled a lacy shawl about my shoulders and smoothed out the pale blue silk of my dress. “Very well. Please escort me to my guests.”\\n\\n Sir Stephan was just as I remembered him: tall, slim, plain, and rather forgettable. His wife, Maria, was much more intriguing and lively. She was Hungarian and beautiful with thick dark hair, pale skin, and gray eyes. When she smiled it was as if a beacon of light surrounded her. Even though the last time I had been in their presence I had threatened their lives, she greeted me warmly.\\n\\n “Countess Dracula, how lovely to see you!” she exclaimed. “We came as soon as we heard the news of your arrival. We’re so excited to see you once again.”\\n\\n I allowed her to kiss me on both cheeks and gave her a false smile in return. Sir Stephan mumbled a greeting and kissed my hand. I could feel his unease sliding off of his skin. My smile widened with satisfaction. I enjoyed watching him pale beneath my gaze.\\n\\n “A pleasure to see you, Countess Dracula,” he said after clearing his throat.\\n\\n I tilted my head as I caught sight of a young woman lingering behind them. “And this is?”\\n\\n “Our daughter, Laura,” Maria answered, taking her daughter’s arm and pushing her toward me. The girl’s head hung down, the thick brown curls around her face hiding it from view.\\n\\n “Laura, how nice to meet you. I am Countess Dracula,” I said, extending my hand.\\n\\n Taking it, she curtsied slightly, and answered, “A pleasure to meet you.”\\n\\n I was speechless when she raised her head, for Laura immediately reminded me of my dead sister. Though she resembled May, her defiant chin, and wary, alert gaze spoke of a personality far more dynamic than that of my sweet delicate sister. Her eyes were large, heavily fringed with dark lashes, and a warm color between green and gold while her full, finely shaped lips and round cheeks were the shade of a pink rose.\\n\\n “Laura just returned from finishing school in France,” Maria explained, her arm delicately looped about her daughter’s. There was a nervous edge to her voice and her eyes darted toward her silent husband.\\n\\n “Did you enjoy studying abroad?” I asked, scrutinizing the daughter of my enemy.\\n\\n “Until I had to return home, yes,” Laura answered boldly.\\n\\n “It is time to find her a good husband,” Sir Stephan said in a voice sharp with the history of many arguments.\\n\\n Laura’s eyes narrowed at his comment and I instantly liked her. There was a spark within her that reminded me much of myself.\\n\\n “We were hoping that perhaps she could find some eligible young man in the coming months,” Maria continued in a jovial tone. “Of course, now that Count Dracula is married, she will have to settle for someone else.”\\n\\n I detected a hidden message in her voice and I studied Maria’s too bright expression. She was afraid for her daughter, I realized. Slowly, it occurred to me that they were pleading not only for their own lives, but their daughter’s. I had threatened to destroy them after all.\\n\\n “Do you desire married life, Laura?” I watched her face with great interest.\\n\\n Sir Stephan cleared his throat as Maria’s smile diminished ever so slightly.\\n\\n Laura graced me with an earnest expression. “My parents would be quite happy if I found a suitable man to marry.”\\n\\n I liked her elusiveness. She was not as outspoken as I was when I was chaffing against my parents desires to marry, but I was impressed. Her parents were clearly relieved she had not said something horribly shocking and it amused me. Taking Laura’s arm, I guided her away from her mother to sit upon the couch with me.\\n\\n “My parents felt exactly as yours,” I told her. “All they wanted for me and my sister was to marry well.” I glanced toward Sir Stephan who was growing ever more pale. He sat down heavily in a high back chair as his wife lingered at his side. “They even journeyed across Europe in pursuit of a suitable husband.”\\n\\n Laura tilted her head, her gaze fastened upon me. “And they settled on Count Dracula?” She sounded incredulous; therefore, I assumed she had most likely met my vampire master in the past. I could see the distaste in her eyes.\\n\\n “Actually, they died. As did my sister. It was a tragedy. In the aftermath, Count Dracula took me as his bride.” I flicked my gaze toward her parents to see that Maria was looking quite anxious now.\\n\\n “So they got what they desired in the end,” Laura decided, her tone cautious.\\n\\n “In a sense, yes, they did.” My sadness crept into my voice.\\n\\n “But all is well now,” Maria said quickly. “Is it not?” It was obvious she wanted some sort of assurance from me. I was not in the mood to give it.\\n\\n “As well as can be expected considering my family is dead and our home in Buda burned mysteriously,” I said with a tight smile. “And our castle in the country is not suitable for long term habitation; therefore, that is why I am visiting with the Baroness.”\\n\\n “It sounds like such a traumatic time!” Laura declared. “So much unhappiness.”\\n\\n “I often wish that circumstances were not such as they are,” I confessed, my gaze sweeping toward Laura’s parents, the conspirators that had doomed my family and me. “Yet the hands of fate moved against me and my family and I am left with ashes of a former life.”\\n\\n “Surely your husband and new life bring you some joy,” Maria said, her voice quavering ever so slightly.\\n\\n “I have found love and it does bring me joy, but there is so much sorrow it is hardly balanced,” I said, dropping my gaze dramatically.\\n\\n “Oh, Countess, how dreadfully sad!” Laura clutched my hands with her own. They were soft and warm. I found her touch reassuring and soothing.\\n\\n “We all bear our burdens,” a voice said from the doorway.\\n\\n “Baroness!” Sir Stephan exclaimed with obvious relief.\\n\\n Striding into the parlor, the baroness was a vision of beauty in her crimson traveling clothes and jaunty bonnet decorated with a spray of black and white ostrich feathers. Her fine porcelain skin contrasted with her raven black hair and dark glittering eyes. Lips red as a cherry smiled brightly as she pulled off her gloves and tossed them at Brice. “How lovely to see you, Countess Dracula!”\\n\\n Even I was swept up in her charismatic beauty as she leaned over and kissed me tenderly on both cheeks, her hands lightly touching my face.\\n\\n “Baroness, it is kind of you to invite me into your home.\\n\\n “You are always welcome, my dear Countess! Laura! My, you are far from the scrawny little colt you once were. So lovely!”\\n\\n The Baroness filled the room with her seductive presence, greeting everyone with kisses and flattering words while slowly shedding her traveling coat and bonnet to reveal the simple, but elegant black frock beneath. With the wave of her hand and silvery laugh, she ordered refreshments for all and took up the position of hostess with a finesse I sorely lack.\\n\\n “As soon as I heard the word that you had arrived, I immediately began my journey home, dear Countess. I was surprised that you should arrive so early since I just received your letter.”\\n\\n “We were forced to leave a little earlier than anticipated,” I answered. Out of the corner of my eye I could see Laura staring at the Baroness with rapt attention. It was easy to be drawn into the Baroness’ web. She was beautiful and charismatic. It was not difficult to ascertain why Vlad had made her his lover.\\n\\n “Nothing too terrible I hope!” the Baroness said, her brow furrowing with worry. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vengeance-of-the-vampire-bride-vampire-bride-2/page-25.html","bookId":2615,"book":{"id":2615,"title":"The Vengeance of the Vampire Bride (Vampire Bride #2)","description":"Storyline: The Vengeance of the Vampire Bride (Vampire Bride #2) \\n In THE TALE OF THE VAMPIRE BRIDE, Lady Glynis suffered great horrors at the hands of her evil vampire master, Count Vlad Dracula, and vowed she would one day escape him. \\n In THE VENGEANCE OF THE VAMPIRE BRIDE, Glynis learns to embrace the title of Countess Dracula as she sets into motion her plans to seek revenge on those who betrayed Glynis and her family to Dracula and to reunite with the man she loves. \\n Despite her ambitions, it soon becomes quite apparent that her life continues to be overshadowed by the ominous presence of Vlad Dracula. \\n Set in the 1820s against the lush gothic backdrop of Buda, Hungary, the tale of one vampire bride’s quest for love, revenge, and the right to determine her own way in life is a sweeping saga that will enthrall any reader who loves the beautiful, deadly vampires of old.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-vengeance-of-the-vampire-bride-vampire-bride-2.jpg","author":"Rhiannon Frater","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-vengeance-of-the-vampire-bride-vampire-bride-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:46:07 PM"}}
