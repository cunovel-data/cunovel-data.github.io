As I studied their features, I concluded they were brothers. There was a wild element to them that unsettled me, but I was even more keenly aware of the white haired vampire studying me from her perch.\\n\\n The small man motioned for silence. “May we all remember this great victory as we continue forth in the name of Gavril.”\\n\\n “Hail Gavril!” the girl on the mausoleum cried out.\\n\\n The other vampires, perhaps a dozen in all, echoed her words.\\n\\n Though Gavril kept his expression neutral, there was a bit of pride in his eyes. “We fought together and were victorious. We lost some of our own in our battles, but we shall remember them always. Jenci, call out the names of our fallen brethren.”\\n\\n The little man stood up and cleared his throat. With sorrow in his voice, he announced those vampires who had died. Of course, Laura and I did not recognize any of the names, but the House of Gavril responded with great emotion. Each name was repeated by the vampires once it was announced and wails of despair erupted from some of those gathered. The emotion among those congregated was more than I was accustomed to witnessing. They tore at their hair and fell on their knees. As Jenci shouted out a name, Ilinca would recount how they died.\\n\\n “Lajos!” Jenci called out.\\n\\n “Fell to the sword of Baatar, but struck off the head of Baatar’s favored Bride!” Ilinca shouted beside him.\\n\\n “Juliana!”\\n\\n “Fell to the teeth of an unknown assailant, but killed four of Baatar’s guards!”\\n\\n In the end, ten names were announced and I realized the great loss the House of Gavril had suffered taking over Buda. Tears of blood streaked the faces of the gathered vampires.\\n\\n Gavril stood and silence fell over the graveyard. “We have lost our beloved brethren, but we are victorious. Tonight we celebrate and mourn together as one family. Together, we plan for our future. This is St. Andrew’s Eve, a sacred night among us. Tonight you may ask of me what you desire. Tonight we acknowledge our allies among us. Let us begin.”\\n\\n The vampire with the white hair stood and approached. She was tall and quite slim, appearing more like a ghost than vampire. She curtsied deep before Gavril.\\n\\n “Rebeka, my first child, speak your desire.”\\n\\n Standing, she said, “I wish to make my favored servant, Izsak, a noble member of the House of Gavril. He fought bravely at my side and has guarded me well for thirty years.”\\n\\n Gavril and Ilinca exchanged glances, then both nodded.\\n\\n “Agreed, Rebeka. He may join us next St. Andrews Eve as a member of the House of Gavril.”\\n\\n “I thank you,” Rebeka answered, smiling and returned to her seat.\\n\\n The young girl dropped down from above, landing in the snow. Dressed in the coat and gown of a child, she was very small compared to Gavril. Her black hair fell to her waist in a tangle of curls.\\n\\n “Zsa Zsa,” Gavril said with a slight smile “my second child. What do you desire?”\\n\\n “I desire no progeny. I wish to have the head of Baatar.”\\n\\n Gavril seemed surprised by this ghoulish request and glanced at Ilinca.\\n\\n “It is only a broken skull,” Ilinca remarked.\\n\\n “I don’t care. I wish to bronze it and place it upon a spike.” Zsa Zsa’s pink lips smiled sweetly. “As a warning for any vampire who would dare come against us.”\\n\\n “Ilinca?” Gavril deferred to his sister. “What do you say?”\\n\\n She shrugged. “Let her have it. I’m sick of seeing it in our bedchamber.”\\n\\n “It is yours, Zsa Zsa.”\\n\\n The little girl grinned with delight. Sliding to her tip toes, she kissed Gavril’s cheek as he leaned down to her. Sauntering past me, she gave me a bit of a feral grin before leaping onto a tombstone.\\n\\n I am not a very patient person and have no great love for ritual, but I was quite fascinated as each of the vampires came forth to ask for favors from their Master and Mistress. Most requested the right to make another vampire. Only one was denied. It was one of the wolf brothers who had chosen a mortal girl with no knowledge of the vampires.\\n\\n “She\u0027ll go mad,” Ilinca informed the crestfallen young man.\\n\\n In the end, he was allowed to kidnap her and make her into his blood concubine. This seemed to please him though it angered me. Laura started to protest, but I silenced her with a look.\\n\\n Jenci stepped forward. “Now to declare the allies of the House of Gavril!”\\n\\n Ilinca strolled to the center of the gathering. “Our allies will be treated with the utmost respect at all times unless Gavril lifts his protection. First, in gratitude for his assistance in destroying Baatar, Count Vlad Dracula. We extend our hospitality to the House of Dracula as well. Joining us tonight are Countess Dracula and her progeny, Laura. All members of their household are under our protection.”\\n\\n The vampires all bowed their heads in our direction.\\n\\n Nervously, I stood up, feeling the need to acknowledge the moment. “I am humbled by your proclamation and thank you.”\\n\\n Gavril nodded curtly, but Ilinca’s smile was warm.\\n\\n “Second, we acknowledge Lord Astir. He did not interfere with our war and was most helpful in securing our allies.”\\n\\n There was a flash of white light and Astir stood before us. A white robe was draped over his tall form and the flaming wings spreading out from his shoulders illuminated the graveyard. The thick coils of his blond hair fell over his shoulder as he bowed low before Gavril. Though his eyes were nothing more than orbs of fire, I thought I caught a twinkle of mischief in them.\\n\\n “I am honored and delighted,” Astir declared, and kissed Gavril’s hand.\\n\\n “His haven will once more be opened not only to our kind but the other supernaturals of the city,” Gavril announced. “You may once more enjoy the entertainment he provides.”\\n\\n The wolf brothers let out howls of delight and clapped each other on their backs.\\n\\n Astir bowed to Ilinca before gliding over to my side.\\n\\n “Well played,” I said to him in hushed tones.\\n\\n “Wasn’t it?” Astir answered, kissing my cheek.\\n\\n “And last, we announce an official envoy from the Immortal Beloved. She who gave birth to all of us has requested that we embrace one of her favored progeny as her voice in our city. Gavril and I have agreed to acknowledge this request. May we introduce Father Ignatius.”\\n\\n As he stepped into the clearing clad in his long black coat, Ignatius’s dark blue eyes met mine.\\n\\n I did not care who witnessed my actions. I flung myself into his arms and kissed him.\\n\\n Chapter 29\\n\\n “As always, a pleasure,” Ignatius whispered, holding my hands.\\n\\n I beamed at him, joy filling my heart. The love in his eyes was a balm to my fretful mind. Abruptly, all the fear and frustration of the last month dissipated under his affectionate gaze. Gently, he took my hand and guided me to Laura and Astir.\\n\\n Astir watched the proceedings with great interest from his perch upon a tomb. His robe and flaming wings faded into more modest attire. He now appeared as a tall, slightly feminine man wearing a long navy coat, black waistcoat, white shirt, red trousers, and shiny black boots.\\n\\n Laura watched Ignatius with great interest as she latched onto my arm. With a slight nod of his head to Astir, Ignatius turned to Gavril and Ilinca. Approaching them, he was an impressive sight with his dark coat and black hair flecked with snow.\\n\\n Bowing his head, he said, “I gratefully accept your gracious invitation into your city. The Immortal Beloved extends her gratitude and affection to all her children.”\\n\\n Gavril also bowed his head, accepting the blessing. “We are honored to have the benediction of one of the first of our kind.”\\n\\n “May she live forever,” Ilinca intoned solemnly, curtseying.\\n\\n All the vampires lowered their heads in supplication to the unseen vampire. I followed suit as did Laura.\\n\\n Ignatius drew out a small gold box and laid it at the feet of the siblings. Ilinca retrieved it with great reverence. She opened it and withdrew a small, stoppered vial. Within was a small portion of red liquid.\\n\\n Ilinca’s eyes widened as she gasped. Gavril mirrored her expression as he stepped to her side. The vampires around me all fell to their knees, not daring to raise their heads. Emulating their actions, Laura and I also knelt.\\n\\n “This is surely the greatest of honors.” Gavril whispered.\\n\\n “She is pleased with your discretion. The mortals were never aware of the vampire war that waged around them for nearly a year. Though she is always saddened by the loss of our own, she is aware of Baatar’s atrocities.” Ignatius paused, letting his words take effect. “She hopes that his legacy is now dead in this city. Therefore, she has sent a gift to empower your house.”\\n\\n Ilinca held the crystal vial aloft for all of her vampires to witness. “Rise, House of Gavril, and let us remember this night when the Immortal Beloved blessed us with her essence.” \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vengeance-of-the-vampire-bride-vampire-bride-2/page-59.html","bookId":2615,"book":{"id":2615,"title":"The Vengeance of the Vampire Bride (Vampire Bride #2)","description":"Storyline: The Vengeance of the Vampire Bride (Vampire Bride #2) \\n In THE TALE OF THE VAMPIRE BRIDE, Lady Glynis suffered great horrors at the hands of her evil vampire master, Count Vlad Dracula, and vowed she would one day escape him. \\n In THE VENGEANCE OF THE VAMPIRE BRIDE, Glynis learns to embrace the title of Countess Dracula as she sets into motion her plans to seek revenge on those who betrayed Glynis and her family to Dracula and to reunite with the man she loves. \\n Despite her ambitions, it soon becomes quite apparent that her life continues to be overshadowed by the ominous presence of Vlad Dracula. \\n Set in the 1820s against the lush gothic backdrop of Buda, Hungary, the tale of one vampire bride’s quest for love, revenge, and the right to determine her own way in life is a sweeping saga that will enthrall any reader who loves the beautiful, deadly vampires of old.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-vengeance-of-the-vampire-bride-vampire-bride-2.jpg","author":"Rhiannon Frater","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-vengeance-of-the-vampire-bride-vampire-bride-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:46:07 PM"}}
