The little boy joyously flung himself into Magda’s arms and made us all laugh. Astir was in a rather good mood and surprised us with gifts. Laura received a lovely hat to match the coat I bought her before her death. Ignatius was less than pleased with a gift of the writings of Saint Ignatius, but Astir thought it was a grand joke. She reclaimed the book and gave him a pocket watch instead. As for me, she gave me a ring. It’s an aquamarine in a white gold setting. She took it from the box and slid it onto the finger where I had once worn Vlad’s ring. Though he no longer haunts my dreams, I sometimes wish I still wore the cursed ring as protection. But this ring is a lovely substitute. It is bright and lovely unlike the ring Vlad had given me. “What shall you tell all your society gossips when spring comes and your husband is obviously not returning?” Astir asked, tilting her head so her exquisite diamond drop earrings glittered in the candlelight. Katya and Laura looked up from where they were admiring Laura’s new hat. Magda was seated near the fire feeding her little boy a bit of pastry while Adem watched them with affection. They both directed their attention toward me, awaiting my answer. Ignatius took my hand and gazed down at the ring, then up at my matching eyes. “Yes, my love, what will you say?” I pondered the question, then shrugged my shoulders. “I’m sure I shall think of something.” Astir tossed back her head and laughed. “Of course.” Gazing at my beloved, I smiled. “It would be a scandal to say I am now divorced and remarried to a priest.” “Though it would be amusing to see how they respond to that proclamation,” he decided before pressing his lips to mine, his hand covering the ring. I returned the kiss with fervor and when we parted we were flushed with joy. Returning my attention to Astir, I saw that her eyes were closed in rapture. Slowly, she opened them and let out a sigh. “What is it, Astir?” I wondered. “So that is it,” she said with awe. “What is?” Ignatius looked amused as Astir fanned herself. “The blissful aspect of love,” she said at last. Sitting beside my love, gazing at my friends and family gathered around the Christmas tree, I knew exactly what she meant. Chapter 37 The Journal of Lady Glynis Wright April 4, 1821 Spring has come and all the fears and terrors of the winter are behind us. Vlad Dracula has been neither seen nor heard from since that fateful night when I reclaimed my freedom, my name, and established my house. Our beloved Percy has been laid to rest in the same mausoleum as my family. Laura and I often leave flowers for him. Oh, Percy, how I miss you. I often dream of my dear friend. He is always smiling and happy to see me and Laura. In my dreams he always touches our cameos and tells us he is still watching over us. In truth, we found out Percy was watching over us in a way we never would have imagined. Adem uncovered letters in Percy’s coat revealing he was in correspondence with my brother, Andrew, in England. Apparently, Andrew had asked Percy to look after me and make certain that I was doing well. In his last letter to Andrew that was not posted, Percy spoke of my brother’s fears being true. He did not detail these fears, but now I wonder if Percy suspected my vampire nature. Upon reflection of some of my conversations with him, I can only wonder. How does this affect my relationship with my brother? I am uncertain. I continue to correspond with him, and I am preparing to inform him that I am now divorced. I know he will be both relieved and scandalized. Now that my new solicitor has made certain that all of the Baroness’ wealth has been transferred to me, I am ready to announce to the world I am once more Lady Glynis Wright. This will, of course, cause a great commotion in my social circle, but I shall survive it. I have survived all else. I am free at last. I am Lady Glynis Wright of the House of Wright. And I am happy. Epilogue The Journal of Lady Glynis Wright May 21, 1821 I am shivering with fear as I struggle to grasp the event that has just occurred. Ignatius slumbers beside me as I write these words, and I wish not to disturb him until I have regained my senses. I am still trembling... It all began when I had the most peculiar dream… I saw Vlad Dracula walking through the gardens of the Dosza Palace. He was dressed elegantly in a gray suit with a tall hat on his head and shaded glasses upon his nose. Striding through our gardens, he inspected the flowers with significant attentiveness. What is truly odd about the dream was that Vlad was walking in daylight. I could see the red glints of his dark auburn hair illuminated in the bright sunlight. I would suppose it was near noon for the sun was high in the sky. Glancing at Ignatius’s pocket watch on the bed stand, I now surmise that would have been just a short while ago. In my dream he found a beautiful, pure white bloom that appeared to suit his purpose and sliced it from the bush with a silver dagger. Satisfied, he strolled purposefully toward the palace. As you often do in dreams, I floated along behind him as he entered through the French doors off the patio and wound his way through the house while deftly avoiding all our servants. At last, he climbed up the grand staircase holding the white rose aloft. Now, my dear diary, this is the horrifying part of the dream. He entered the room where I lay asleep in Ignatius’s arms. With a wicked smile, Vlad approached our bed as we slept. Gently, he disengaged me from Ignatius’s embrace, turning me so I lay upon my back. Leaning over, he kissed me tenderly upon the mouth. “We shall be reunited, my love. You and I shall rule all vampires and watch the world smolder at our feet. You are mine,” he whispered against my lips. Setting the rose upon my bed stand, he kissed the petals, then slipped out of the room. I awoke with a start when I heard the bedroom door close. Snatching up my robe, I ran to the door and wrenched it open. Though my sitting room was empty, I heard footsteps in the hall beyond. My heart beating rapidly within my chest, I hurried out into the hallway. Per my edict, all the windows are covered so that the palace is plunged into a perpetual dusk during the hours of the day. The sound of steps retreating down the staircase echoed through the long corridor. With inhuman speed, I rushed to the banister and leaned over it. Below Vlad Dracula strode across the foyer to the front doors of my home. I gasped in horror and he heard me. Lifting his head, he lightly touched the brim of his top hat, smiled, and opened the door. Sunlight flooded the foyer and washed over him. I crouched in the shadows of a pillar in terror as he stood in the blazing light of the day staring up at me. Adjusting his glasses, he smiled once more, and departed. The door shut behind him, plunging the foyer into shadows. Terrified, I fled to my room where I now sit, huddled in my bed trembling for I realize that what I experienced was no mere dream or mirage. For you see, dearest diary......how it terrifies me to write this......when I returned to my bed a white rose sat upon my bed stand with a single drop of blood resting upon its perfect petals...","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vengeance-of-the-vampire-bride-vampire-bride-2/page-74.html","bookId":2615,"book":{"id":2615,"title":"The Vengeance of the Vampire Bride (Vampire Bride #2)","description":"Storyline: The Vengeance of the Vampire Bride (Vampire Bride #2) In THE TALE OF THE VAMPIRE BRIDE, Lady Glynis suffered great horrors at the hands of her evil vampire master, Count Vlad Dracula, and vowed she would one day escape him.
