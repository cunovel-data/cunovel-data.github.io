I was pleased with Laura’s strength of mind and will, but a little taken aback by her already growing powers. Brice appeared in the doorway, his solemn expression unreadable as always. When he announced Percy had arrived, I was not surprised. Percy had become the inadvertent hero in Adem’s and my make-believe drama about the rescue of Laura. I was gutted that I had to create memories in his mind to fool him into believing he had saved Laura. It felt like a violation of our wonderful friendship. But I could still remember the terror in his eyes after she had ripped open his throat and I felt the moment was better forgotten. “Please escort him in, Brice.” He bowed his head and left to obey. Laura moved to sit beside me on the sofa, her hand gripping mine. “What shall we say?” “Let him lead the conversation. He believes he found and rescued you. Remember that.” Nervously nodding, she tried to take on the pose of someone who had suffered a great trauma. I tried to wipe away my smile of bemusement. “Laura, Countess!” Percy entered the parlor in a rush of motion. He gripped my hands tightly as I greeted him, then abandoned my side to kneel next to Laura. He clutched her hand and kissed her fingers. “Dear Laura, it is such a relief to see you safe and far away from that dreadful mausoleum. When I think of you trapped and cold it breaks my heart.” I felt a cold finger of discomfort at his words. He did not seem quite himself, and I feared my tampering had altered him in some way. “But you saved me,” Laura answered in her lovely voice. “And I am far away from there now. Glynis is taking very good care of me.” “Your hand is still chilled.” He rubbed it vigorously, attempting to warm it. “It is a relief that your illness has not reclaimed you after spending so much time in the cold.” Percy drew up a chair to sit close to her. “I believe the coffin kept me from the elements.” Laura glanced at me for reassurance, and I gave her a slight nod. Percy’s keen blue eyes gazed deep into hers as she spoke and he shook his head sorrowfully. “I only wish that I could have returned you to your parents. It was a terrible scene to witness. I am glad that you were safely away with Countess Dracula when I discovered them.” “I am grateful to you and Adem for handling the matters with the police. They did come here, but were very kind.” “It is a remarkable story, Laura. That you were buried alive is a tragedy unto itself, but for you to be rescued just as thieves murder your parents...” He trailed off. “It is almost unbelievable.” “And yet it happened,” I said swiftly. “You hear of such things, but it is difficult to believe until you witness it with your own eyes. Yet, I vividly recall Laura calling out from the mausoleum in terror. It is something I shall never forget. For a moment, forgive me, Laura, I thought you were a wraith.” He laughed, a nervous sound. “How could I, a reasonable man of my time, believe such a thing I do not know. But I am glad you are here, safe with Countess Dracula.” I returned the affectionate gaze he cast in my direction, but I felt uneasy. His visit was short-lived. Though he spent most of his time with his attention focused on Laura, I had the strange sensation that he was watching me. I dismissed the observation, believing I had become paranoid since I altered his memory. I resented Vlad for forcing his will upon me. Wouldn’t I anticipate the same from Percy? When he finally said goodbye, he kissed my cheek and regarded me with one of his inscrutable expressions. “You are a remarkable woman to take her in as you have,” he said as he prepared to depart. “What else could I do?” He merely smiled, donned his hat, and ventured out into the night. I turned to find Brice standing near the doorway. He was studying me with some interest. I had the impression that I was being constantly measured on his moral scale. I wondered briefly how I was faring. “A letter for you,” he said, presenting it to me. Taking the envelope, I gazed down at the unknown seal. I glanced up at him. “Who sent this?” “It arrived by messenger. He merely stated he was instructed to deliver it immediately.” Mystified, I thanked Brice and broke open the seal. Come to us tonight on St. Andrew’s Eve. The gathering is in the graveyard outside of Borbála’s estate on Castle Hill. Bring your progeny with you. Ilinca I let out a gasp and tried to not panic. Brice watched me with his aloof expression. “Is there something amiss?” Shaking my head, I waved him away. “Leave me.” He inclined his head and departed. Frightened, I stood in the foyer clutching the letter. Ilinca and Gavril knew about Laura, of course. It was not so difficult for a vampire to view the events of the previous night and ascertain what had occurred. But how would that affect their treaty with Vlad? Shredding the invitation to bits, I was angered by my own fears. “Enough of this,” I chastised myself. Striding to the parlor to collect Laura, I admonished myself for hiding constantly from the ones I feared. I would never be able to stand upon my own two feet amongst the supernaturals if I did not speak up for myself. I had listened to Astir and done her bidding. Perhaps I had gained enough goodwill from Ilinca that I could stand before her unafraid. As for Gavril, I would have to determine my course of action once I met him. It was time for me to fully embrace my role as Countess Dracula. Like Vlad, I would not be afraid in the face of my enemies. Shortly thereafter, Laura and I strolled along the banks of the Danube toward Borbála’s estate. The cold was brutal, but it was not the same detriment to our progress as it would have been to a mortal. Though vampires are not adversely affected by the cold, we wore heavy woolen dresses over multiple petticoats, thick stockings, sturdy boots, and long coats. We both wore our hair unfettered beneath the hoods of our coats. “The river is nearly completely frozen over,” Laura observed. The Danube was hidden beneath a thick sheet of ice that was cracked and broken in spots revealing the black waters below. Snow flurries whipped about us as we continued on toward our destination. “This winter is truly unforgiving. I do believe this is the beginning of a great blizzard.” I reached back to help her over a gnarl of roots. Laura clung to my hand gratefully. “It will be impossible for the mortals to travel to Pesth soon.” “I doubt they can now.” I glanced over my shoulder at the frozen river and the city beyond before we plunged back into the trees. The snow was thick beneath our feet and several times we were tripped by hidden roots and rocks. Our vampiric abilities enabled us to escape injury, but we were slowed in our journey. I had considered flying or transforming into a mist, but decided against such a show of power. Besides, it would tap into my power to perform such tasks. I wished to retain my full strength while facing Ilinca and Gavril. Clasping hands, we helped each other maneuver past grand estates and through thickets of trees before at last coming upon the small ancestral graveyard in the shadow of Borbála’s grand home. Candles with flickering flames were nestled into the crannies of the ornate mausoleum and towering monuments. Ilinca stood in the center of the graveyard, face turned upward, arms outstretched, letting the icy flakes fall upon her lips. Dressed entirely in ivory from her gown to her heavy cloak trimmed in white fur, she was beautiful to behold. A bright, rapturous smile of delight adorned her features. I felt the coil of tension knotted within me lessen at the sight of the lovely vampire with the unusual eyes enjoying the falling snow. Relief washed over me as I wondered if I had overreacted to the summons by the new rulers of Buda. That emotion only lasted until I spotted Gavril. Instantly, I was seized by fear. Seated on the steps leading to the heavy doors of the mausoleum, Gavril was clad in black with a thick brown cloak about his shoulders. His unusual eyes were exactly like those of his sister: one blue, one green, but there was no playfulness in his gaze like there was in Ilinca’s. Though he was just as handsome as his sister was beautiful, his face held the brutal strength and determination of a warrior. As he scrutinized me with his fierce eyes, his lips as full and finely shaped as his sister’s pressed into a stern line. The thick curls that adorned his head fell jauntily over his brow to just above his eyes, but his posture was anything but casual. I had the insane urge to curtsey to him. I realized I was in the presence of a king. Ilinca cast a amused look in my direction and swept about in a circle, her cloak flaring dramatically. She appeared to drift over to Gavril’s side on invisible wings. “See, she came. Just as I said she would. Fleeing would be so childish and foolish.” As she spoke, she pressed the back of her hand to his cheek.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vengeance-of-the-vampire-bride-vampire-bride-2/page-57.html","bookId":2615,"book":{"id":2615,"title":"The Vengeance of the Vampire Bride (Vampire Bride #2)","description":"Storyline: The Vengeance of the Vampire Bride (Vampire Bride #2) In THE TALE OF THE VAMPIRE BRIDE, Lady Glynis suffered great horrors at the hands of her evil vampire master, Count Vlad Dracula, and vowed she would one day escape him.
