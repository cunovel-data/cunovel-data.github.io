He took the chair across from me. Light and darkness played over his features. The firelight glowed against his shiny black boots. Gold rings on his fingers caught the light and sparkled. “I was summoned to his side this evening and sent to you. He was concerned for your welfare and that of your husband, Count Dracula.”\n I lifted my eyes, suddenly afraid. I had not revealed to Astir the terrible act I had committed against Vlad. Adem had not asked to speak to Vlad, but to me. Could this mean that I was suspect?\n “My husband is at the castle,” I said.\n “That is what I was told when I arrived. Should I travel to the castle to inform him as well?” Adem’s expression was unreadable.\n “There is no need. I was returning alone to the city to establish a new home while he tends to the restoration of the castle.” My lie came easily to my lips.\n “Very well,” Adem answered. “Shall I escort you back to the castle tonight?”\n Making a great show of fussing with my letters, setting them into some order, I shook my head. “There is a situation at the castle that Vlad desires to deal with alone.”\n “I see,” Adem said, and I was afraid that he did truly ascertain that I was lying.\n “My vampire mother...Cneajna...” I bit my bottom lip and fought sudden tears. “My marriage to Vlad has not set well with her. It is not safe for me to be in her presence. He is...dealing with the situation.”\n “That is unfortunate,” Adem decided, his dark eyes regarding me thoughtfully. “I do understand that vampire families can be complicated when there are shifts in power.”\n I nodded my head, my lips pressed tightly together. I could still remember the terror and pain when Cneajna struck her dagger repeatedly into my flesh, not to kill me, but to make me suffer.\n “Lord Astir did request that I make absolutely certain you are safe. Since you will not be returning to the castle, I shall stay here with you. I have brought my own men to replace the ones that were sent by Lord Astir to deliver you and your husband safely to the castle.”\n Slowly I raised my eyes, trying to read the stoic face of the man across from me. His dark eyes disturbed me with their piercing gaze. I feared he saw through all my lies.\n “I do not know if that is necessary.”\n “Lord Astir was quite explicit in his command that no harm is to come to you. I am to stay at your side until I am certain you are safe. I am not convinced you are out of harm’s way residing in this hotel so far from your husband’s side.”\n My fingers fidgeting with the edges of the letters, I sighed. How I wished I had left immediately for Buda instead of preparing my way with correspondence to Vlad’s minions and Astir. Yet, I would not want to arrive in the city to find myself pursued by the vampire hunters that had burned my home to the ground. I was also certain I would not want to face the dhamphir vampire hunter known as Gregor without Vlad or Ignatius at my side. The thought of Ignatius brought a terrible wrench of pain through my chest. How would I find him?\n “Very well. I shall stay here until Lord Astir declares that it is safe for me to return,” I acquiesced.\n “I shall inform him of your decision,” Adem assured me.\n I was not certain if there was the hint of a threat in his tone or not. “Thank you.”\n “Shall I inform your husband as well?”\n I lifted my eyes to the fire and shook my head. “He has enough to worry about. I shall send a letter via the normal post simply stating I am delayed. I do not wish for him to be unnecessarily worried.” I felt tears once more brimming in my eyes at the thought of Vlad. Toward the end of our time together, he had been very protective of me. I knew if he believed me in danger and was capable, he would come to my defense immediately. Of course, he would also punish me for my defiance.\n “I have upset you with my news,” Adem said softly. “I apologize, Countess.”\n “It is no fault of yours. I am merely overwhelmed with the events of the past week or so. It has been a troubling time.”\n Adem inclined his head in agreement. “Yes. The vampire hunters are disturbing in their relentlessness to destroy the undead and other creatures of the night.”\n The vampire hunters were the least of my worries. I had other concerns and felt very alone. I craved companionship in that moment. If only there was someone with whom to speak about my woes. But there was no one.\n Standing, I held my returned letters tightly in my hand. “I do need to send correspondence to my husband’s servants in Buda. I speak for him in matters of our estate there. Could you arrange for fresh letters to be delivered?”\n “Of course.”\n “I shall then retire to my room to write.” I strolled toward the door, wishing to escape.\n He quickly leaped up to open it for me. “I have ordered the proprietor to remove the guests from the rooms around yours. The guards will occupy those rooms. I shall have the one directly across from yours. I am at your disposal whenever I am needed.”\n “Thank you. You are very kind. I shall thank Astir for entrusting my care into your capable hands. I feel quite protected.” I smiled slightly, then hurried toward the staircase that would lead me to my room. To my dismay, he fell into step behind me.\n “I should check your room and make sure it is sufficiently secure to keep you safe during the day, Countess. We cannot be certain that the vampire hunters will not venture into this area.”\n His footfalls were heavy on the stairs while mine were light as a feather. I was annoyed with his intrusion into my evening and his lord’s admonition that I should stay away from Buda. My teeth were sharp in my mouth and my eyes burned as my power rose. Perhaps I had been a fool not to have fed in previous nights for now my temper and hunger were intricately intertwined.\n “Please be quick about it,” I answered rather sharply. “I have much writing to do before the sun rises.”\n “Of course,” he answered, not taking offense at my tone. In fact, he seemed slightly amused.\n Reaching the door to my room, Adem stepped forward to open it. Seeing that I had not locked it behind me, he gave me an admonishing look. I gave him a tense smile in response. Opening the door, he entered, a dagger flashing in his hand. The appearance of the weapon surprised me for I had not even seen him draw it.\n There was a sharp exclamation from within the room. Peering past Adem’s shoulder, I saw Katya lying on my bed, her hand drawn up to her neck. Her surprised expression matched Adem’s.\n Moving swiftly into the room, I walked over to the bed, grabbed the girl’s wrist, and wrenched her off. She cried out and flailed as she crashed to the floor. The bedcovers and pillows slid off the bed into a silky heap. My little journal lay exposed for all to see. I could see Adem’s sharp eyes take in the small volume, but he said nothing as he slid his dagger into a hidden sheath in his sleeve.\n “You said to come later,” Katya uttered sullenly.\n “When I am in the room. I do not care for people to cavort among my personal affects when I am not present!” My fingers gripped her wrist tighter as I shook her.\n “Forgiveness!”\n “Do not enter my room unless I give you specific instructions.”\n “I will obey you. I promise!” She clung to my skirt, her large blue eyes begging for my mercy.\n I released her arm and snatched up my journal. Turning my back on Adem, I quickly tossed my letters into the small fireplace in the corner of the room. I scowled as the red wax with the imprint of a dragon slowly burned in the glowing embers. That my plans to return to Buda and exact my revenge on Vlad’s minions were delayed angered me. I sat down at my desk and tucked my journal under a sheaf of paper as Adem meticulously scrutinized the windows and shutters.\n Meanwhile, Katya roused herself from her weeping and tidied up my bed. She smiled at me timidly, obviously trying to impress me with her servitude.\n Tapping my gold pen against the inkwell, I considered my next course of action. If I had to stay in Bistriţa, then I would continue my search for Erzsébet. I was certain Vlad had moved her crypt. Perhaps her new resting place would not be as secure as her former prison. I desired to rescue and restore her. The other Brides may scorn me, but I knew she would not. Erzsébet had understood my need to be free of Vlad. Perhaps she could take me to Ignatius. After all, they were both the offspring of their Mistress, therefore siblings of her blood.\n Upon finishing his inspection of my room, Adem let out a low sigh, shaking his head. “It will have to do. I will have men stationed across the street to make certain that you will not be attacked through the windows given the close proximity of the other buildings. Yet, I do not see a better room to relocate you. If you do not mind, I will have iron shutters installed on the inside of the windows. You will be able to close and lock them before you rest. I’m sure the proprietor of the building will not mind such an arrangement.”\n Katya began to open her mouth to protest, but was silence by Adem’s quick look. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vengeance-of-the-vampire-bride-vampire-bride-2/page-2.html","bookId":2615,"book":{"id":2615,"title":"The Vengeance of the Vampire Bride (Vampire Bride #2)","description":"Storyline: \n The Vengeance of the Vampire Bride (Vampire Bride #2) \n In THE TALE OF THE VAMPIRE BRIDE, Lady Glynis suffered great horrors at the hands of her evil vampire master, Count Vlad Dracula, and vowed she would one day escape him. \n In THE VENGEANCE OF THE VAMPIRE BRIDE, Glynis learns to embrace the title of Countess Dracula as she sets into motion her plans to seek revenge on those who betrayed Glynis and her family to Dracula and to reunite with the man she loves. \n Despite her ambitions, it soon becomes quite apparent that her life continues to be overshadowed by the ominous presence of Vlad Dracula. \n Set in the 1820s against the lush gothic backdrop of Buda, Hungary, the tale of one vampire bride’s quest for love, revenge, and the right to determine her own way in life is a sweeping saga that will enthrall any reader who loves the beautiful, deadly vampires of old.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-vengeance-of-the-vampire-bride-vampire-bride-2.jpg","author":"Rhiannon Frater","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-vengeance-of-the-vampire-bride-vampire-bride-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:46:07 PM"}}
