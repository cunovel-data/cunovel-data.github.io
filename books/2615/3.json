I had been engulfed in flames and burnt severely. I would not like a repeat of that particular incident in my temporary haven. “Please take care of it immediately, Adem.”\n “I will, Countess.” Adem’s gaze rested on Katya.\n The lovely blond thing was lingering near the bed, her fingers lightly skimming over the silken bedclothes. It was bedding Vlad had explicitly requested during our previous stay. Her expression was languid and sensual. It was obvious that she was waiting for Adem to leave us.\n Approaching me, Adem looked apprehensive. Slowly, he leaned down to whisper, “Do you think it wise to feed off her? We do not want to anger her father.”\n “My husband often feeds from her during his visits. I will only take a little.”\n “Perhaps you should feed from my men,” Adem suggested, his dark eyes narrowing on the girl.\n “And you?” I arched a brow.\n Adem smirked. “My blood would not satisfy you. I shall arrange for my men to offer their throats to you every night. Take what you need. They are all born of Lord Astir’s haven and have given their blood before.”\n Katya frowned, overhearing our conversation. “But I want her to kiss me! How dare you interfere!”\n “That is enough,” I said sharply to the girl.\n She bit her bottom lip, her eyes filling with tears. Surprisingly, she stayed silent.\n Standing, I turned to Adem. “A little sip every night will probably be wise considering my situation. It is best if I do not hunt with any regularity in the city for fear of drawing attention.”\n “Agreed. I shall send one of my men to your door every night at the hour of your choosing.”\n “Thank you. I do appreciate your assistance in the matters of my security and comfort,” I said, and meant my words. I was maudlin and agitated by my circumstances, but his presence was strangely comforting.\n He smiled, the scars on his cheeks and lip tugging oddly on his flesh. “It is my pleasure. Shall I take the girl with me?”\n Katya fumed, her gaze imploring me.\n “No. No. I must feed tonight and a sip now and again will keep her...” I turned study her flushed, eager gaze, “...sated.”\n Her smile at Adem was triumphant and he bowed his head to my wishes. “Until tomorrow, dear Countess.”\n “Good evening, Adem.”\n With one last concerned glance at my guest, Adem left the room and I locked the door after him. I turned to find Katya near. She was breathing heavily, her chest heaving, her pale skin flushed, and her eyes dewy with need.\n “Please,” she whispered, turning her head to expose her slim throat.\n I felt my teeth growing sharp and my stomach felt hollow. The hunger was whispering through my veins as I stepped toward her. My arm caught her about the waist and she moaned with pleasure as she swooned. Since she was taller, I found myself at a disadvantage. I lowered her to the floor, resting her head gently against the wood. Her blond hair was radiant in the firelight and reminded me vividly of Cneajna. Leaning over her, I opened my mouth, my fangs sharp against my lips. Katya trembled beneath me, her fingers tangled in her skirts, clutching them.\n With a quick lunge forward, I sank my sharp teeth deep into her flesh and reveled in the first great burst of blood in my mouth. I drank in the rich fluid, feeling it rushing through my body like warm wine. I took small sips from the girl’s throat, my hands gripping her shoulders tightly. Her moans of delight were disconcerting, but I ignored them as I fed. Quickly satiated, I withdrew my fangs and licked the blood from my lips.\n “More,” she cried out softly. “More!” Her hands gripped at my arms as I drew away. She followed me up, her hands pressed to my neck and cheek. As I ran my tongue over my bloodied lips, she pressed her mouth against my cheek, murmuring.\n I stood sharply, disturbed by her seduction. I snatched up my handkerchief from my desk and pressed it to my lips. I felt her hands on my skirt, pulling on it, begging me to drink again.\n “You can go now,” I told her.\n Rising, she drew close once more, her hands rising to her bodice. “Please, drink from me. You may drink from me however you want. I do not care. Please!” Exposing her creamy breasts to me, I saw the scars of Vlad’s teeth on her soft skin.\n “Cover yourself!” I felt a flash of anger and jealousy at the sight.\n Trembling, she obeyed. I could see her fear, bewilderment and desire. “Perhaps here then?” She raised her skirt, exposing her thighs. I could see his bites there as well.\n I gripped her arms and shook her. “I do not want to use you as he did. Do you understand?”\n She shook her head in confusion. “Please...”\n “Leave me!” I threw her away, disgusted. I was mortified by the corruption of such a young woman by Vlad. But was I not the same as her? My bites did not scar, but I knew his bite intimately. The pleasure it brought caused me to burn at the mere thought.\n Climbing to her feet, Katya let out a plaintive cry. “Please, mistress, forgive me. Do not shun me. I will not...try to do this again. I will...” She timidly approached me. “I will not touch you or seduce you. Just let me feel your kiss. Please.”\n My anger leaving me, I reached out and stroked her cheek. “I will let you feel my kiss. But I am not my husband. I will not defile you as he did.”\n Relieved, she kissed my hand and reluctantly went to the door. I could see that she wanted to once more fling herself into my arms and beg for my bite, but she refrained. Unlocking the door, she slipped out into the hall. I saw Adem’s keen eyes watching from the doorway across from my room. Inclining his head, his gaze did not stray from my face until I closed the door and locked it.\n Trembling, I threw myself across my bed and wept.\n May 8, 1820\n Dearest Astir,\n I am pressed to secure passage to my next destination, so I write this in haste. Have you received word of Count Vlad Dracula and Lady Glynis? I am most concerned for their safety considering the attack on their home in Buda.\n If you have had contact with them, please let me know their current location and if they need assistance. I shall endeavor to join them as soon as my Mistress permits it.\n Sincerely,\n Father Ignatius\n May 12, 1820\n Dear Father Ignatius,\n I hope this letter finds you safe and sound in the lovely arms of the Immortal Beloved. Please send your gracious and most beautiful Mistress my love.\n As for Count Vlad Dracula and his wife, Glynis, I have not seen a word from his noble hand. I suppose I should assume they have returned to their estate in the Carpathian Mountains.\n Will you be returning to Buda soon? If so, be aware that the vampire hunters have murdered quite a few of your brethren as well as suspected innocents. You may not desire to be too hasty in your return.\n You friend,\n Astir\n Chapter 2\n The Journal of Countess Dracula\n May 8, 1820\n The Golden Krone Hotel, Bistriţa\n I am tormented in the aftermath of the horrors that engulfed my mind as I lay sleeping. I have dreamt of Vlad before, but as I slumbered during the hours of the day I suffered the most vivid nightmare. Though I am loath to put to paper what I endured, I recognize that I must be aware of dark powers at work. By documenting this terrible nightmare, I shall have a written record of the event. Should it be nothing more than my mind deceiving me as I sleep, than I shall be quite relieved. But if it is an ill omen of Vlad Dracula rising from his tomb...\n The dream began as many do. I thought I had awakened in my darkened hotel room, the bedcovers pulled up to my chin. The shuttered windows let in not one sliver of light and in my stupor it took a few moments for my eyes to accustom to the darkness.\n Pushing down my covers, I let the cool air brush over my face and neck. It was a sensuous feeling as I rolled onto my side, tucking my hand under the pillows. The silk coverlet bundled around my waist as I lay quietly, listening to the sounds of the humans in the street below.\n I could imagine them bustling about, hurrying on errands, working, chatting, laughing, and doing the sort of tasks mortal men and women occupy their time with during the daylight hours. In the distance, I heard a baby crying and a mother crooning to soothe the infant’s ill temper. Horses neighed and carriages creaked as they carried their passengers and wares to unknown destinations. I imagined myself out in the sun, looking up at the white clouds skimming across pale blue skies as birds took flight. In my fanciful notion, I added Ignatius at my side, his rare smile making me laugh.\n A hand slid over my waist.\n I gasped in surprise. I attempted to sit up, but was restrained. A firm, broad chest pressed against my back as I felt cool lips trail up my neck to nestle against my red hair. Twisting about, I could make out a dark shape in the bed beside me. Dark, long hair fell over my body like a curtain as a bare leg, thick with muscle, thrust between my thighs.\n I flailed as my hands sought to break the iron grip around my waist. With a growl of passion, my attacker licked my throat. I gasped as my fingers traced over the large hand pressed under my breasts. I felt the outline of the signet ring of Vlad Dracula. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vengeance-of-the-vampire-bride-vampire-bride-2/page-3.html","bookId":2615,"book":{"id":2615,"title":"The Vengeance of the Vampire Bride (Vampire Bride #2)","description":"Storyline: \n The Vengeance of the Vampire Bride (Vampire Bride #2) \n In THE TALE OF THE VAMPIRE BRIDE, Lady Glynis suffered great horrors at the hands of her evil vampire master, Count Vlad Dracula, and vowed she would one day escape him. \n In THE VENGEANCE OF THE VAMPIRE BRIDE, Glynis learns to embrace the title of Countess Dracula as she sets into motion her plans to seek revenge on those who betrayed Glynis and her family to Dracula and to reunite with the man she loves. \n Despite her ambitions, it soon becomes quite apparent that her life continues to be overshadowed by the ominous presence of Vlad Dracula. \n Set in the 1820s against the lush gothic backdrop of Buda, Hungary, the tale of one vampire bride’s quest for love, revenge, and the right to determine her own way in life is a sweeping saga that will enthrall any reader who loves the beautiful, deadly vampires of old.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-vengeance-of-the-vampire-bride-vampire-bride-2.jpg","author":"Rhiannon Frater","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-vengeance-of-the-vampire-bride-vampire-bride-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:46:07 PM"}}
