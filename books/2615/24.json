But I would like to be respectful.”\\n\\n I shrugged as I ran a sponge over my legs. “I really don’t care, Adem. Conventions be damned. You are my friend.”\\n\\n “She’s being naughty,” Magda declared, entering with my nightclothes. “She just fed and is in a very good mood.”\\n\\n “I’m not trying to seduce you, Adem. Am I, Magda?”\\n\\n “No, she’s not.” Magda appeared amused by Adem’s discomfort. She began to wash my hair, her nimble fingers a joy.\\n\\n Adem slowly relaxed and took a seat at my vanity. His exhaustion was etched into his scarred face and he suppressed a yawn. “Katya is at the haven and despite her temper tantrums, seemed relatively happy with her new surroundings when I departed.”\\n\\n “Is Astir at the haven?” I asked.\\n\\n “He has returned, but had very little to say. At least to me.” Adem plucked his turban from his head and ran a hand over his curly hair. He also looked unusually weary and I wondered again if Astir’s magic had sapped us all.\\n\\n “I wish to see him as soon as possible. There is much I wish to discuss with him. Could you deliver a message for me tomorrow evening requesting a meeting?”\\n\\n “Of course.” Adem paused, gathering his thoughts, before continuing. “May I ask what you plan to do with the Baroness? I know you have no love for Vlad’s minions.”\\n\\n Magda rinsed my hair as I pondered how I should word my answer. My plan was still taking shape in my mind, but I knew the crux of it. “I have yet to decide her exact fate. For the moment I need her assistance in establishing my presence in the city once again. But once I am done with her, she will die.”\\n\\n “Vengeance does not always bring satisfaction,” Adem warned, concern filling his voice.\\n\\n “No. Not always. But I crave it like blood. I could not save my family, but I can serve justice in their names.” My good mood was significantly diminished by his words. I did not want to be dissuaded from punishing those who had destroyed my family.\\n\\n I rose from the water and Magda swept a towel about me, covering my nakedness. From Adem’s expression, it was clear he was more concerned about my plans than my nudity.\\n\\n “What of Sir Stephan?” he asked. “How will you avenge your family?”\\n\\n “I haven’t decided yet,” I confessed.\\n\\n “You do not think he will suspect you?”\\n\\n “If he does, I will beguile him. He lusts me. I will use that against him,” I said in a dark tone remembering when he had attempted to kiss me.\\n\\n Adem crossed his arms over his broad chest, reflecting on my words.\\n\\n “I will not rush into any of my plans,” I swore. “I shall take my time. I do not want to repeat the mistakes of my past.”\\n\\n Adem slowly exhaled. “I shall do what I can to assist you.”\\n\\n “And keep her from foolishness,” Magda murmured.\\n\\n “Magda!” I protested.\\n\\n She just smiled while she helped me into my nightgown.\\n\\n “You’re a wily young woman,” Adem said as he stood.\\n\\n “Is that a compliment?” I arched my brow at him.\\n\\n “Of course. But with youth comes naiveté. That is best remembered.”\\n\\n Far too aware of my faults, I sighed. “I will call upon you to give me sage wisdom and guidance.”\\n\\n “And I will be here.”\\n\\n I hesitated before continuing, but I felt I could draw him into my confidence even further. “Adem, you know of Father Ignatius, do you not?”\\n\\n “Yes, I do.”\\n\\n Magda’s hands paused as she tied the ribbons of my gown.\\n\\n I could see the warning in her eyes, but I could not restrain myself. “If you see him in the city, please let me know immediately.”\\n\\n “I was not aware that he is a friend of yours considering his past with Vlad,” Adem responded.\\n\\n “He is dear to me,” I confessed.\\n\\n Adem’s eyes searched my face and he slightly nodded. “I understand. Should I see him, I shall inform you immediately.”\\n\\n “You may go now,” I said softly.\\n\\n “Until tomorrow night,” he said with a bow and left.\\n\\n “Do not chide me!” I said defensively before Magda could open her mouth.\\n\\n “All your secrets will be laid out before the entire city of Buda if you do not tread carefully,” Magda chastised me anyway.\\n\\n “Adem will not betray me,” I said stubbornly.\\n\\n “Probably not, but you must be careful. Astir is protecting you, but one day someone will uncover the truth of what you have done.”\\n\\n “And I shall be far from here with Ignatius at my side,” I retorted as I crawled onto the bed. I pushed Magda’s hand away as she attempted to tend to my hair. I was feeling surly and lonely.\\n\\n “I should brush your hair and curl it. Tomorrow you will have visitors,” she said in a firm tone.\\n\\n “They will not be Ignatius so why bother,” I groused.\\n\\n Magda sighed.\\n\\n “Very well!”\\n\\n I darted from the bed and sat before the vanity. There was no mirror and I was slightly impressed by the Baroness’ forethought. I sat in grumpy silence as Magda tended to my hair and slowly relaxed as her fingers expertly tidied up my long locks.\\n\\n At last I said, “Magda, why do you think Vlad gave me his power?”\\n\\n It was a question that haunted me. I suspected it was to tie me to him, but perhaps I was wrong. I was torn as I reflected on my last night with him. Though in my heart I knew he had manipulated me, a part of me, that dark specter he had infused into my soul, wanted to believe he had truly considered me to be the worthy heir of his power.\\n\\n “I believe he expects to return,” Magda said at last. “Perhaps when the blow that struck him down was not a killing one, he believed he would one day be freed from the coffin. By you, or another servant.”\\n\\n “He said he loved me,” I confessed. “I believed him.”\\n\\n “And now?”\\n\\n I shook my head, tears suddenly threatening. “No. Not now.”\\n\\n “I believe you are wrong. In my time with him he has loved other women. He brought ruin on all of them,” Magda said, laying her hands lightly on my shoulders. “His love is like fire. It consumes. It destroys. It is not born of a pure heart, but out of evil need.”\\n\\n “He has done something to me,” I whispered. “I dream of him and it is terrible. I never want to feel him touch me again, yet a dark aspect within me yearns for him.”\\n\\n “Do you want to go to him?”\\n\\n “Never! Never again! I will choose whom I love! Whom I take to my bed! Where I go! When I go! I will not allow him to destroy me. I will have my freedom. I will have my life! My love! My Ignatius!”\\n\\n Magda sat beside me and took my hand. “May I tell you a story?”\\n\\n “Yes, please,” I answered.\\n\\n “Vlad fell in love with a young woman who was betrothed to another. Zsofia was very young and afraid of him. But he seduced her using his power. He drank from her, lay with her, forced her to drink his blood. The young man she loved and was to marry grew suspicious of her growing malaise and ill temper. So he hid away in Zsofia’s room and saw Vlad come to her in the dark of night. He confronted Vlad. Vlad twisted his neck and flung him out the window. All believed that the young man had tried to seduce his love before their marriage and fell to his death when she spurned him. Zsofia...she was so lovely...mourned deeply as Vlad continued to drink her life away. He summoned her out of her house while her family slept and took her to Astir’s haven. He exposed her to debauchery like she had never imagined. Slowly, Zsofia went mad as he stole away her life and soul.”\\n\\n “What happened to her?”\\n\\n “She died,” Magda said with a sigh. “And rose again. Vlad was waiting for her to rise and brought her back to the mansion. He trapped her in the house to keep her presence from her grieving family, but she was dangerous. Zsofia killed some of the servants, which enraged him. He beat her. She raged at him.”\\n\\n I shivered, remembering far too well my own abuse at his hands.\\n\\n “Zsofia tried to fight him. Tried to fight what he had done to her. I could hear her weeping throughout the night. He forced her to drink from him, binding her tighter and tighter to him. And then one night, she no longer cried. She no longer fought. He had achieved his goal and she wascompletely enamored with him.” Magda touched my ring lightly. “This ring was hers.”\\n\\n Gazing down at my ring, I felt a cold chill sweep through my flesh. “She was conquered.”\\n\\n “Yes, and after a time he grew bored of her and found another girl to love. He was going to take Zsofia to the castle to join the other Brides. She was horrified to discover there were other women, other Brides. She was heartbroken. In despair, she set herself on fire and burned before our eyes.”\\n\\n “What did Vlad do?” I asked though I already suspected the truth.\\n\\n “He watched her burn, ordered us to clean up her ashes, and departed to see his new conquest.” Magda tucked her hair back from her face. “Though I witnessed Vlad attempting to secure the same fate for you through his power and blood, you were far stronger than she was. When I realized you were in love with another, I did all I could to help you hide that from Vlad. I did not want you to meet her fate. He destroys what he loves. Always.” \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vengeance-of-the-vampire-bride-vampire-bride-2/page-24.html","bookId":2615,"book":{"id":2615,"title":"The Vengeance of the Vampire Bride (Vampire Bride #2)","description":"Storyline: The Vengeance of the Vampire Bride (Vampire Bride #2) \\n In THE TALE OF THE VAMPIRE BRIDE, Lady Glynis suffered great horrors at the hands of her evil vampire master, Count Vlad Dracula, and vowed she would one day escape him. \\n In THE VENGEANCE OF THE VAMPIRE BRIDE, Glynis learns to embrace the title of Countess Dracula as she sets into motion her plans to seek revenge on those who betrayed Glynis and her family to Dracula and to reunite with the man she loves. \\n Despite her ambitions, it soon becomes quite apparent that her life continues to be overshadowed by the ominous presence of Vlad Dracula. \\n Set in the 1820s against the lush gothic backdrop of Buda, Hungary, the tale of one vampire bride’s quest for love, revenge, and the right to determine her own way in life is a sweeping saga that will enthrall any reader who loves the beautiful, deadly vampires of old.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-vengeance-of-the-vampire-bride-vampire-bride-2.jpg","author":"Rhiannon Frater","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-vengeance-of-the-vampire-bride-vampire-bride-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:46:07 PM"}}
