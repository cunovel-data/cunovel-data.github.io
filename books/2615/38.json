I decided to risk coming here for one night to speak to you truthfully.” “One night?” My voice trembled and my anger stirred. Setting the folded stocking aside, he nodded, then began to gently remove the other. “What has Astir told you about the situation in Buda? “Very little.” My anger dissipated as he slid his hands slowly over my legs and kissed my knee. “That there are powers in this city it is best I avoid.” Ignatius chuckled. “Then he has not told you of the great vampire war that is tearing apart the cities of Buda and Pesth?” I shook my head. “No he has not!” Ignatius’s body slid between my legs as he lowered himself over me. His hand lightly plucked at my hair, pulling it free of its design. His weight upon me was heavenly as I slipped my hands beneath his clothing to rest upon his skin. His face close to mine, he said, “A vampire of great power has claimed Buda and Pesth as his own for many centuries. His name was Baatar and he invaded this land long ago with his Mongolian brethren.” I remembered the words of the vampire who had attacked me on my journey. He had claimed to be of the House of Baatar. I was beginning to understand how much Astir had hidden from me. Ignatius continued: “He remained after he was transformed into a vampire. Vampires are not always civilized, but Baatar was a man of vision. He saw himself as an undead king over his claimed land. There was a time when crazed vampires rose from the grave to feast on the living, creating more of their own kind. It was an epidemic that threatened all of the vampires. Villagers staked as many as they could find, but it was dangerous for those of us who were more civilized. In the fervor of the vampire hunts, we could also be slaughtered. Therefore, we killed hundreds of the mad creatures to save ourselves. Baatar killed not only the ones infected with madness, but those who were not. Vampires such as you and I.” “Why?” I gazed up at him, enraptured by his voice and beauty as he unfurled my long hair. “He did not want to be usurped. For centuries, he controlled this land and only allowed his own progeny to feed here. Vlad and Baatar did not like one another, but they respected each other. They created a truce between them as the world became more civilized. Baatar had no love for my Mistress and she feared him. Therefore, Baatar enjoyed making Vlad his ally.” “You speak of Baatar as if he is no longer alive.” “He is not. He is dead. Two vampires conspired to kill him. Their names are Ilinca and Gavril. They are brother and sister not only of vampire blood, but mortal blood. They are Magyar and they found it quite distasteful that a Mongolian controlled their home country. Vlad swore fealty to Baatar, but agreed to stand aside and allow Ilinca and Gavril to kill Baatar. It was Ilinca and Gavril who sent the vampire hunters to kill the progeny of Baatar and weaken him.” “But they attacked us!” Ignatius kissed my forehead gently as his hand lightly caressed my neck. “Yes. Sometimes when you create a fire it burns out of control. Ilinca and Gavril lost control of the vampire hunters once their leader realized their benefactors were vampires themselves.” “And who killed Baatar?” “Vlad.” Ignatius stated. “Why? If he was just going to stand aside?” “So that you and he could stay in Buda without any threat from Ilinca and Gavril. They would have eventually killed Baatar, but Vlad saw an opportunity to gain their favor. He killed Baatar and stepped aside for them to rule. He has no designs on Buda, but desired a safe haven here. Ilinca and Gavril are still attempting to exert their control over the territory. Now that Baatar and his progeny are gone, other vampires are challenging Ilinca and Gavril. It is a difficult time.” “And thus why Astir told me to act merely as a mortal countess and not draw attention to myself,” I said, understanding completely the danger of my situation. Ignatius tenderly kissed my lips. “And why I cannot be in the city. I am seen as a threat. I have been in correspondence with Gavril, but he is adamant that I cannot return to Buda. I am a threat to their power. I would not have stayed away for so long after I knew of your whereabouts if not for the complications brought about by Baatar’s overthrow. My only solace was that Astir was protecting you in my absence.” “Yet now you came here for me,” I said, my voice soft with emotion. “I came to realize that to not reveal the truth of your predicament was a folly no matter what my Mistress, or Astir may say. You have the right to know what has occurred so you may tread carefully.” I slid from his grasp and rolled from the bed. The letter lay at my feet, a comfort and a curse. The truth was a bitterly cold sharp pain within me. “So we cannot be together,” I whispered. “Despite everything I have done, we cannot be together.” “Glynis, what have you done?” His touch was gentle against my skin as he took hold of my arms and pulled me back against his chest. I could feet his chin resting on my head as he enfolded me in his arms. “Where is Vlad?” His voice was very soft, yet frightening. “Why is he not here?” I swallowed hard and stared down at the letter. “Tell me, Glynis,” he urged me. A strangled sob escaped my lips. Holding onto his hands, I fell back against him. Tilting my head to one side, I invited his bite. His mouth trailed over my ear to my throat and I waited for fangs to pierce my flesh. It came sharp and delicious, and I swooned against him. His mouth pulled three deep drinks from my neck before he stopped. “Oh, Glynis, what did you do to Vlad?” he moaned. “He is alive. I did not kill him.” Turning me about, he stared down into my eyes, seeking the truth from my gaze. “I did not kill him. He is not dead.” “His power is now yours. I taste it.” “It is mine now.” Closing his eyes, he leaned his forehead upon mine. “I see.” “I am yours.” “And I am yours, my complicated love.” I drew him down into my arms and kissed him feverishly. I craved his touch and love. His mouth passionately consumed mine and I clung to him. It was I who disrobed him and pressed him down upon the bed so I could cover him with my kisses. It was I who shrugged off my heavy dress and straddled him. It was I who took him deep into my body between my thighs and made love to him. But it was Ignatius who took my face between his hands and whispered the words that liberated me from my fears. “I will tell no one what you have done.” Chapter 19 The nightmare came as it always does. I am asleep when Vlad Dracula manifests in my bed. I always see his cruel green eyes, thick auburn hair, and strong muscled shoulders. I feel his thick lips kissing my skin and his strong body pressing down upon mine. I hear his deep voice purring in my ear as his large hands rub over my body. I am always afraid, aroused, and angry when the dream comes. “Release me and we shall be together again. Release me and I shall love you as before. Come to me, free me, and we shall be together,” he says in my dreams. Sometimes I waken before he thrusts into my body, but other times I am trapped within the dream and writhe under him as he violates me. This time his seduction was the same, but then he became aware of the sleeping form beside me. Anger bloomed in his eyes and his hands cruelly gripped my flesh. I awakened with a scream as his rough hands shoved my thighs apart. To feel Vlad enter me after my wonderful night with Ignatius was too horrible to bear. I opened my eyes and cried out for Vlad’s green eyes glowered down upon me. “Ignatius!” My hand lashed out to clutch Ignatius’s arm with trembling fingers. He awoke and gasped. Gripping me close, Ignatius ripped me away from the phantom. Together, we bore witness to the power of Dracula, for Vlad was a ghostly manifestation. His naked body pushed up the covers where I had lain. The rage etched in his face was terrifying as he lashed out with his hand to draw me back. “She is mine!” Vlad roared. I whimpered, kicking at the image of my Master as Ignatius pulled me free of the bed. He held me against him protectively, glaring at the apparition. “It is a projection of his spirit,” Ignatius whispered in my ear. “He is not truly here. Do not be afraid.” “Oh, no! Be afraid!” Vlad shouted. His image wavered slightly as he struggled to follow us. I felt weak at the sight of him and clung to Ignatius. Vlad managed to free his ghostly form from the bed and took a threatening step toward us. “I shall kill you for touching her! I warned you, Ignatius!” “You may threaten me, but we know the truth of it. You are weak and far from here,” Ignatius said in a dangerous tone. “You are trapped in your coffin!” I snarled at Vlad, anger diminishing my fear. “Do not threaten us! You cannot touch us!” “I touch you every time you sleep,” Vlad reminded me as his apparition struggled to draw closer to me. His smirk was cruel. “I make you writhe, don’t I? Did she tell you that, Ignatius?”","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vengeance-of-the-vampire-bride-vampire-bride-2/page-38.html","bookId":2615,"book":{"id":2615,"title":"The Vengeance of the Vampire Bride (Vampire Bride #2)","description":"Storyline: The Vengeance of the Vampire Bride (Vampire Bride #2) In THE TALE OF THE VAMPIRE BRIDE, Lady Glynis suffered great horrors at the hands of her evil vampire master, Count Vlad Dracula, and vowed she would one day escape him.
