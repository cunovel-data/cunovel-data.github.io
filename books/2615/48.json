I swear it.”\n Ilinca’s expression was somber as she gently stroked my cheek. I could feel her power slipping over my skin, seizing hold of me. I did not fight, but was submissive. “You still have your secrets, but they do not concern us.” The delicate touch of her power receded and she stepped back. “I shall inform Gavril.”\n “About Ignatius...” I dared to say.\n Ilinca’s smile returned. “As I said, I know how it is to love someone that is forbidden.” With one last touch of her hand against my cheek, she left me to rejoin the party.\n I watched her walk to a tall imposing figure wearing a golden mask fashioned to resemble the sun. Despite the distance between us, I could see that his hair was as dark as his sister’s and his eyes were also different colors: one blue, one green. Gavril stared at me for a long moment, then turned his attention to his petite sister as she joined him. He leaned his long form over her and touched her lips lightly with his fingers. Watching them, I felt disturbed and afraid. Ilinca cast one more smile in my direction, then the two of them strode into the depths of the crowd.\n Overwhelmed, I fled to my rooms and did not return to the ball.\n Chapter 23\n The Journal of Countess Dracula\n November 7, 1820\n The Dosza Palace\n Since the ball, I have kept to the Dosza Palace, feeding off Csilla and my guards to sustain myself. I refused all visitors, claiming illness. I lay in bed, anxious and afraid, unable to calm myself.\n At last, I realized I was being foolish and that no good would come of sequestering myself. Csilla already looks quite drawn by my drinks from her throat.\n When I received an invitation from Laura to join her on a shopping expedition to Váci Street, I decided I was done with languishing in my rooms. If Ilinca and Gavril decide to kill me, I will not be able to stop them.\n “Oh, how I wish you hadn’t become ill at the ball. Though Percy was a darling, I had to put up with that terrible Dietrich all night,” Laura exclaimed. We trailed behind her mother through the crowd, Adem walking a discreet, but watchful distance behind us.\n The street lamps flickered as shoppers hurried about hoping to make their purchases before the shops closed. Other people strolled to the cafes and restaurants along the street. A few street performers were still out, braving the growing cold of the night. The first snowfall of the year had yet to occur, but the sky was heavy with ominous clouds and the wind was biting.\n My wool coat with its thick fur cuffs and collar kept the chill from seeping into my flesh, but Laura’s shivering form and red cheeks proved that the purchase of a new coat for her was greatly needed. Maria rushed us along to the shop where Pelisse coats were for sale. My own was a deep navy with thick black fur and silver buttons. I rather liked the styling that was reminiscent of a military uniform.\n “I’m so sorry. Didn’t Percy assist you in dealing with Dietrich?”\n We kept our voices down as we followed Maria through the throng of shoppers. She obviously did not approve of me joining them on this late shopping expedition. Laura had insisted on waiting for me. Maria didn’t understand why Laura wanted my approval on the purchase. I thought she actually wanted some company other than her mother, but I was happy to offer my opinion.\n “Yes, of course, he did. He’s such a sweet man, but father kept chasing him off. Dietrich is insisting on asking for my hand in marriage at Christmas.” Laura’s eyes flashed with her anger. “I already told him not to ask for I shall say no. But he is convinced I shall change my mind. Honestly, he frightens me. He attempted to kiss me again and offered to sneak through my window at night.”\n “Have you told your father?” I felt outrage at Dietrich’s actions.\n Laura shook her head in dismally. “He only says I am trying to be difficult.”\n Maria ushered us into the warmth of the small boutique. Her dark eyes studied our faces with curiosity, but we both smiled at her, wiping away our tense expressions. “Hurry along! The shop will close soon.”\n Adem entered after us and lingered near the door. Maria gave him a worried expression, but quickly forgot him as she drove us deeper into the store filled with the latest fashions. The shopkeeper had been notified of our visit and already several coats had been set aside for Laura to try on. We dropped the subject of Dietrich as she excitedly studied the selections. I had been to the shop before and was impressed by the coats and dresses their seamstresses created. Unlike most shops, this one had clothing already made that was altered to fit the customer. Two coats fit her with no alterations needed whatsoever, which thrilled her. We were both keen on a light blue coat with soft white fur on the collar, but Maria was adamant about a rose colored one with brown fur.\n “It matches your hair, Laura,” Maria said.\n “Her hair will blend into the fur. The white will be a nice contrast.” I smiled at Maria sweetly. “Don’t you think?”\n Maria sniffed and fussed with the coat she selected.\n Laura sighed and leaned close to me. “She doesn’t like it because you do.”\n I pointed at the coat Laura desired. “I will purchase that coat as a gift. Please wrap it.”\n “Countess Dracula!” Maria gasped.\n “It is my pleasure. Truly.” I gave her a wide, earnest smile and ignored her protests as I drew out my purse.\n “It is a very nice choice,” the shopkeeper dared to say.\n Maria shoved her selection toward him. “I shall take this one as well.”\n Looking pleased with the double sale, the shopkeeper quickly began to fold the coats into long, white boxes.\n I became aware of Adem at my side and gave him a curious look.\n “Prepare yourself,” he whispered.\n The door opened and Lady Astir stepped through the doorway. Clad in a beautiful white coat with white fur and gold accents, she was the very epitome of beauty. Her long gold hair was looped around in an ornate design and her thick wool hat matched her coat to perfection.\n “Countess Dracula!”\n “Lady Astir, how lovely to see you,” I said, trying not to appear anxious.\n Maria looked positively startled at Lady Astir’s appearance. The fallen angel’s height and imposingly handsome countenance can be somewhat intimidating.\n My surprise deepened when I saw two women were in Astir’s wake. One was Katya dressed in a sophisticated outfit of deep green and the other woman was dark and exotic and dressed in red attire. The smile on Katya’s face broadened as she saw me and her pink tongue darted out between her lips to lick them.\n I wanted to slap her.\n “That is Saadat,” Adem murmured in my ear before he took his place at my side.\n I barely had a chance to look at his wife before Astir was upon me.\n “I am so pleased to see you.” Lady Astir made a great show of kissing me on both cheeks, before regarding my companions. “And who are your lovely friends?”\n I quickly introduced Maria and Laura. I was frantic to escape the shop and Lady Astir. Nothing good ever seems to come of my visits with her. She’s always a harbinger of some terrible news.\n “Lovely to meet you, Lady Astir. I don’t recognize your accent. Is your husband Hungarian?” Maria was obviously attempting to be courteous, but her voice slightly trembled.\n “No, he’s not. Oh, that is a lovely coat.” Astir said with admiration as the shopkeeper carefully folded the blue coat into a box. “Preparing for the winter, I see. It will be a terribly cold one. I feel it in my bones.”\n “You have bones?” The words escaped my lips before I could stop myself.\n Astir laughed with delight. “Some would say that is all I am made from. My height and all that.”\n Laura watched what was transpiring around her with great interest. I could see that she was studying not only Lady Astir, but her two silent companions. Katya’s ruby lips and sparkling eyes were dangerously seductive as she watched me pay for my purchase. Laura’s gaze kept flicking back and forth between us.\n “Are you a close friend of Count and Countess Dracula?” Maria’s pallor was a bit pale and I could see her unease.\n “Oh, we’re quite close. Aren’t we, darling?”\n “Of course, Astir,” I answered, not daring to provoke the creature. She was in one of her moods and I did not dare aggravate her.\n “That is a lovely coat. It will look wonderful on you.” Astir smiled down at me and I was unnerved to see the tension about her mouth.\n “It’s for me,” Laura said. She seemed unsure of the undercurrents swirling about her, but she was a bold young thing and not about to be intimidated. “The countess was kind enough to purchase it as a gift. She is a kind and good friend, you know.”\n “For you? Really?” Astir’s eyes slightly narrowed, then she laughed. “How kind of her. You will certainly need it with the winter so swiftly coming. In fact, I believe it will snow tonight. The sky looks ominous.”\n Gathering up the packages, Maria lifted her chin and charged toward the door. “Come along, girls. It’s growing late. We must hurry to the cafe if we wish to be home at a decent hour.” \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/the-vengeance-of-the-vampire-bride-vampire-bride-2/page-48.html","bookId":2615,"book":{"id":2615,"title":"The Vengeance of the Vampire Bride (Vampire Bride #2)","description":"Storyline: \n The Vengeance of the Vampire Bride (Vampire Bride #2) \n In THE TALE OF THE VAMPIRE BRIDE, Lady Glynis suffered great horrors at the hands of her evil vampire master, Count Vlad Dracula, and vowed she would one day escape him. \n In THE VENGEANCE OF THE VAMPIRE BRIDE, Glynis learns to embrace the title of Countess Dracula as she sets into motion her plans to seek revenge on those who betrayed Glynis and her family to Dracula and to reunite with the man she loves. \n Despite her ambitions, it soon becomes quite apparent that her life continues to be overshadowed by the ominous presence of Vlad Dracula. \n Set in the 1820s against the lush gothic backdrop of Buda, Hungary, the tale of one vampire bride’s quest for love, revenge, and the right to determine her own way in life is a sweeping saga that will enthrall any reader who loves the beautiful, deadly vampires of old.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/the-vengeance-of-the-vampire-bride-vampire-bride-2.jpg","author":"Rhiannon Frater","type":"Horror","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/the-vengeance-of-the-vampire-bride-vampire-bride-2.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:56 AM","modification":"Oct 5, 2019 6:46:07 PM"}}
