{"id":29128,"no":21,"title":"Chapter 21","content":"At the breakfast the professor was irritably anxious. \"I wish I knew of some way of getting at Montague this morning; he ought to have a telephone put in!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You know why he doesn\u0027t,\" said Frances gently. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I couldn\u0027t sleep last night, thinking of him.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The cup Frances held clattered in her trembling hands. Sleep! She remembered the big fire, the bright light she had kept all the night; she remembered how she had walked her room, had undressed, gone to bed, gotten up, dressed again, and sat by the fire shaking like the trees outside before the heavy blasts; remembered how she had resented the blue of the sky, and the rose of the sunrise flushing the east, while far off the fringe of heavy clouds fled away, when she flung open the shutters to the morning;[Pg 266] and how every moment since she had held herself tense, listening, straining, for the tragedy she felt the night held. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"That old woman might attend to the \u0027phone,\" said her father, going back to his grievance. Montague had said long ago that with his all morning and all afternoon absences from the house while his work took him from field to vineyard, from vineyard to mountain-top, a telephone was useless. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I think I\u0027ll call up Frazier,\" he said at last, as he pushed back his chair, \"he\u0027s near and might know.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Father, you must not; he would never understand his trying to reach home last night.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Neither do I!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027ll hear soon enough, if there\u0027s anything to hear.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I shall be uneasy until I do.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Uneasy! Frances worked that morning as she had never done in her life, swept, dusted, cleaned from one room to another. Susan would not have allowed the labor for an[Pg 267] hour; Roxie was glad enough to get it done for her. Frances worked, piling up the moments, worked, and yet heard every footstep in the corridor outside; at each fresh footfall her heart beat to suffocation, then as they died away she drew long breaths and turned to her tasks. At last, beyond the noon, the telephone rang. Frances had the receiver at her ear, before the ringing stopped. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Hello!\" she called, \"who is it?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Frazier!\" The receiver almost fell from her hand. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Well!\" and over the long distance wire faintly was coming, \"that old woman, Susan, sent a boy over here just now, and said to \u0027phone you to come out there right away and bring the doctor!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Bill,\" said the girl to herself, with a sobbing sigh of relief. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"All right!\" she called, \"I\u0027ll come at once!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Bill is worse,\" she told herself, as with trembling hands she rang up first the stables, and then the doctor. \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 268] \\n\\n \\n\\n The doctor would go; she would call for him at once. \\n\\n \\n\\n Before she turned away, her father opened the door. \\n\\n \\n\\n On his face she saw the tragedy she awaited. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Montague is drowned!\" he cried. \"My God!\" for Frances had gone down in a heap on the hall floor, the receiver swinging from side to side where she wrenched it as she fell. \"Susan! Roxie! bring me some water!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No!\" Frances was struggling upright, \"let me go, father! I don\u0027t want anything!\" to Roxie; \"go on!\" she waved her back to the kitchen impatiently. \"How did you hear?\" she whispered as the scared darkey shut the door behind her. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"His horse was found this morning, dripping, spent, riderless.\" The professor was white as his daughter. \"I—I must telegraph his father!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Don\u0027t!\" pleaded Frances, \"don\u0027t; he might be safe yet somewhere!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The professor cut her short with a motion of his hand. \"If he were, don\u0027t you suppose[Pg 269] we\u0027d know! And he left my house!\" he said bitterly. \\n\\n \\n\\n Frances\u0027 head drooped. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"What will his father think of me?\" he added. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was not of others\u0027 words she was thinking; it was what her own heart was telling her in great heavy throbs. \"You have killed him! You killed him!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She put her hands up dully to her ears, but the sound was only the louder. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Frances!\" Something in her face, her heavy drooping as she started up the stair frightened her father, \"What are you going to do?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I am going out to Susan\u0027s; she sent for me to bring the doctor out.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You\u0027d better let him go alone.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I\u0027m sure Susan wants me, or she would never have given such a message. If there is anything I can do for her I ought to do it!\" Her broken sentences were spoken from the stair as she went up. \\n\\n \\n\\n When she came down the trap was waiting. Her father went out with her, put her[Pg 270] into the vehicle and tucked the robes about her. The world was flooded with sunshine, the grass down in the folds of the hills was vividly green, the tree-tops, gray and brown, were tossing softly; the professor thrust a bill in his daughter\u0027s hand. \"Tell the doctor to get whatever he thinks Susan might need.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Frances had one last word. \"Don\u0027t telegraph yet!\" she begged. \\n\\n \\n\\n It seemed a senseless thing, but he did as she pleaded. The afternoon was full of duties for him. He went through them mechanically and before he was done had a sharp message from the doctor, \"Come out at once!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n Frances had driven around for the doctor, told him briefly what she feared for Susan, gave her father\u0027s message, and then, white and dumb, had no other word to say through their drive. The doctor, glad of an hour\u0027s quiet, lounged in his seat, as they made what speed they could through heavy mud and mire and great pools of water; the dull sodden fields and green patches of winter[Pg 271] wheat and far-off hazy mountains claimed scarce a glance, but once or twice he looked curiously at the face of the girl by his side. He had held her, a new-born babe, known every phase of her childhood and girlhood, and it cut him to the heart to see that stricken look. He had his own dread of the cause likewise; for the tragedy the professor told was one which had stirred the town. \\n\\n \\n\\n Soon as they glimpsed the cabin, they saw Susan\u0027s spare figure standing on the step, the door closed behind her, while she strained her anxious eyes for help. \\n\\n \\n\\n She hurried to the trap. While the doctor fumbled with his medicine case, Frances sprang out on the other side. She hastened at once to the door; she did not even hear Susan\u0027s anxious \"Honey, maybe yuh\u0027d bettah not go in dyar!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n She pushed it open. There sat Bill by the fire. There, on Susan\u0027s bed— \\n\\n \\n\\n Frances gave a great cry and sank on her knees beside it. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Great God!\" cried the doctor as he pushed her roughly aside, for there, on Susan\u0027s bed,[Pg 272] with closed eyes and no signs of life showing in his face, lay Edward Montague. The doctor ran his hand under the covers over the man\u0027s heart. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He\u0027s libin\u0027!\" declared Susan, \"he\u0027s been moanin\u0027 once or twice!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He\u0027s in a swoon. Bring me my medicine case! Give me a spoon! Chafe his hands and wrists!\" The doctor worked anxiously; there was a faint flicker in the pulse, a slow beating of the heart. \"Come away!\" he commanded as they went over to the window. \"Where did you find him?\" asked the doctor. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Down dyar!\" Susan pointed down the valley with shaking fingers, \"ebery day o\u0027 my life Ise used to comin\u0027 out an\u0027 lookin\u0027 up an\u0027 down an\u0027 ober to the hills, an\u0027 thinkin\u0027 \u0027bout de Bible an\u0027 de hills dat gib strength. Dis mornin\u0027—\" Frances made an impatient movement, but the doctor quieted her. He knew Susan must tell her story her own way. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"It sho\u0027 was a sight! Dis mornin\u0027 de meader was jes\u0027 as wet, an\u0027 de grass was all flat where de watah done run off it, an\u0027 de[Pg 273] crows was flyin\u0027 an\u0027 callin\u0027 up in de sky. I kep\u0027 goin\u0027 to de do\u0027 an\u0027 lookin\u0027 an\u0027 lookin\u0027, an\u0027 by an\u0027 by I sees sumpin\u0027 down by dat little fringe o\u0027 trees, an\u0027 I knows, jes\u0027 lak dat, dat \u0027twas a man. I says to Bill—he \u0027s been hobblin\u0027 roun\u0027 right smart lately—\u0027Bill, yuh come \u0027long, dyar\u0027s a man down dyar.\u0027 An\u0027 when we got dyar we seed \u0027twas Marse Edward, an\u0027 dat\u0027s all.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"How did you get him here?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Oh, we got him up, eben if he is right sizable.\" Susan had little to say of her own feat, and of Bill\u0027s. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I pulls off his clothes and gets him into bed wid a hot brick to his feet, an\u0027 den I runs out to de road an\u0027 de firs\u0027 pusson I sees I sends to Mr. Frazier\u0027s.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The doctor had been holding the whispered talk near the little window. He had done all he could, and while he waited he made Susan tell the tale, for the sake of the girl who leaned against the cabin side, that stricken look yet in her face. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why did you send for her?\" he asked sternly. \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 274] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"La! Who I gwine git to help me if \u0027tain\u0027t Miss Frances?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why didn\u0027t you send for her father?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Ain\u0027t I been libin\u0027 in his house all dese years,\" whispered Susan back indignantly, \"an\u0027 don\u0027t I know he\u0027s nebber to be \u0027sturbed when he\u0027s at his work. He\u0027s down at de hall now!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The doctor went back to the bedside. He motioned Susan and bent to his work again. \\n\\n \\n\\n By and by the inert figure stirred; there was a faint flush of color in the white face; the doctor put a spoon to his lips, again and again. The young man opened his eyes, looked at him without a glimpse of recognition, turned a little on his side, and fell asleep. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He\u0027s dry—quite?\" the doctor whispered to Susan. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"I stripped off ebery rag he had. He\u0027s got on Bill\u0027s shut now.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n A smile twitched the doctor\u0027s mouth, but he went on gravely enough. \"Is the brick hot?\" \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 275] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"\u0027Tis de third one I done put in dyar!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Keep the fire going all you can!\" to Bill. Bill before the fire piled log after log with utmost quiet. The doctor pushed a flag chair noiselessly towards Frances; Susan, used to long waiting, drooped by the footboard; the doctor walked to and fro with noiseless footsteps from bed to window. Out there, the narrow valley was flooded with sunshine, the stream running full and red with the clay of the fields it had ravaged; in here lay the victim of the flood. He took out his watch, slipped it back again, looked long out of the little window towards the distant purple peaks, went back to the bedside, looked, leaned over,—turned, his face beaming. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Perspiration!\" he whispered, as he touched the edges of the young man\u0027s forehead. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"You mean—\" gasped Frances. \\n\\n \\n\\n \"He\u0027s all right, for the present, if he doesn\u0027t have pneumonia. My dear child!\" for Frances went white to the lips. \\n\\n \\n\\n [Pg 276] \\n\\n \\n\\n \"No!\" she steadied herself, \"I\u0027m not going to faint! Thank God!\" \\n\\n \\n\\n The doctor laid his hand on her shoulder gently, \"I shall send for your father at once, and when he comes you must go.\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Why should I?\" she flashed. \"He needs—\" \\n\\n \\n\\n \"Nothing that we cannot do!\" And he listened to no argument. He scarcely allowed the professor to stay long enough to let slip from his lips the joy that brimmed his heart, but with significant look at his daughter sent them homewards at once. \\n\\n \\n\\n It was dusk then, and they went quietly both with joy in their hearts, and both with memory, likewise. The father, all the deep waters of his life stirred by the despair and the gratitude held so closely together, saw, as in a vision, the love of his life who had driven along this way so often by his side, and sent his whole heart out to the memory of her. His daughter saw first a pleading, earnest face, and then the white unconscious one; listened to earnest words, that pleaded more strongly now the speaker\u0027s lips were closed, remembered all the thoughtfulness and kindliness in which she had read only friendliness, and in which she read now deep, strong love, a love that placed her own happiness above all else. To each their vision, sweet and bitter, bitter and sweet. \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/ertong/2276/63871.html","bookId":593,"book":{"id":593,"title":"A Girl of Virginia","description":"简介： Good morning!
