Alexander leaned over me, his eyes filled with worry. \"Are you okay?\" he asked sorrowfully. \"You got in the way.\" \"Am I a...?\" I didn\u0027t even want to finish my thought. He shook his head and helped me to my feet. \"You have to go!\" he commanded again. \"You shouldn\u0027t be here--you\u0027re in danger.\" I turned to look around for Jagger. But all I saw were grave markers. \"But I may never see you,\" I pleaded. \"You must leave now,\" he persisted. Alexander was breaking my heart again. If I left, it could be for the last time. How could I be sure Jagger wouldn\u0027t harm him? Alexander could disappear into the night forever. But if I didn\u0027t listen to his instructions, I might actually be doing Alexander more harm by getting in his way. I saw Jagger stumbling by the baroness\u0027s monument and wiping his mouth. His green and blue eyes had turned fiery red. His lean muscles tensed. He grinned at me and licked his lips like a rabid animal ready to rip into its prey. I didn\u0027t even have time to kiss my Gothic Mate good-bye. I ran without looking back, tears and raindrops dripping down my face, the graveyard mud splashing against my boots, my heart pulsing. Thunder clapped against the trees and seemed to echo against the tombstones. I raced to the entrance of the cemetery and climbed over the fence. When I turned around, Jagger and Alexander were gone.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/kissing-coffins-vampire-kisses-2/page-11.html","bookId":1867,"book":{"id":1867,"title":"Kissing Coffins (Vampire Kisses #2)","description":"Storyline: Kissing Coffins (Vampire Kisses #2) Not far from Dullsville, someone\u0027s lurking in the dark. . . .
