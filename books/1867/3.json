It wasn\u0027t as if I were a celebrity, but schoolmates who had never even looked my way before called, \"What\u0027s up, Raven?\"\\n\\n But besides a hello wave, nothing had changed. No one except Matt and Becky invited me to eat lunch, offered me a ride home, or asked me to join their study group. Not one classmate secretly passed me a note or bothered to share his pack of gum. Thankfully, I was too distracted to appreciate any rise in status and spent a morbidly long afternoon in front of the library computer searching the Internet for the Coffin Club.\\n\\n \"I want to visit Aunt Libby,\" I told my parents that night at dinner.\\n\\n \"Aunt Libby?\" my dad asked. \"We haven\u0027t seen her in ages.\"\\n\\n \"I know. And it\u0027s about time. Spring break starts Wednesday. I\u0027d like to leave tomorrow afternoon.\"\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t imagine you\u0027d want to be away from Alexander for a minute, much less a few days,\" my mom said.\\n\\n \"Of course I\u0027ll die being away from Alexander,\" I exclaimed, rolling my eyes. I could feel my family staring at me, waiting for my next response. \"But he\u0027s going to be tied up with his homeschooling exams. So I thought I\u0027d take the opportunity to see Aunt Libby.\"\\n\\n My parents looked at each other. \"Are you sure you\u0027re not going there to see a Wicked Wiccas concert?\"\\n\\n \"Dad! They broke up five years ago.\"\\n\\n \"Well, Libby\u0027s not a very good role model,\" my dad remarked. \"And who knows what neurotic guy she\u0027s involved with this time.\"\\n\\n \"Dad, she\u0027s more like you than you think. You just don\u0027t drive a hippie mobile anymore.\"\\n\\n \"I remember visiting my aunt when I was a teenager,\" my mom said. \"She took me to see Hair.\"\\n\\n \"See--I need these memorable teen experiences to shape my life.\"\\n\\n \"Libby gets such a kick out of Raven,\" she admitted. \"It would be good for her as well.\"\\n\\n \"All right,\" Dad said reluctantly. \"I\u0027ll call her tonight. But if she\u0027s still practicing voodoo, you\u0027re not going.\"\\n\\n After dinner I met Becky by the swings at Evans Park.\\n\\n \"I had to talk to you, pronto,\" I began.\\n\\n \"Me, too! Life is so good. Can you believe we both have boyfriends?\"\\n\\n Even if Alexander weren\u0027t a vampire, the idea of us having boyfriends was still unreal. We\u0027d both been social outcasts for so many years, it was incomprehensible to be accepted by anyone but each other.\\n\\n \"I need you to come on a little trip with me,\" I told her. \"Trip?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m going to visit my aunt Libby and I need you to come!\" I exclaimed excitedly.\\n\\n \"This weekend? I\u0027ll have to ask.\"\\n\\n \"No, I\u0027m leaving tomorrow afternoon.\"\\n\\n \"Matt asked me to watch his soccer game after school.\"\\n\\n \"You just started seeing him!\" I argued.\\n\\n \"I thought you\u0027d be happy for me. Besides, I was going to ask you to come.\"\\n\\n The thought of watching a soccer game made me want to hurl, but Becky\u0027s glow made me realize I was being selfish. \"I am happy for you, but--\"\\n\\n \"Can\u0027t you go another time?\" she begged. \"We have all spring break to hang out with Matt and Alexander.\"\\n\\n There was no point arguing. Becky was going to watch Matt\u0027s game tomorrow, just as I was going to search for Alexander. No amount of pleading would make us change our minds. Now that Matt had abandoned his best friend, my nemesis, Trevor, the thorn in my side since kindergarten, he would hang out with Becky all the time. And I was jealous of Becky for having a boyfriend who hadn\u0027t disappeared into the night.\\n\\n \"Why is this trip so important?\" she asked.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s top secret.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s top secret?\" Matt inquired, appearing behind us.\\n\\n \"What are you doing here?\" I asked, startled. \"This is a private meeting.\" \"Becky and I are going to Ace\u0027s Arcade. She told me to meet her here.\"\\n\\n It was bad enough I was losing Alexander to the Underworld, but when I needed my best friend the most, I was losing her to 3-D pinball.\\n\\n \"I gotta go,\" I said, turning away.\\n\\n \"So what was your top secret news?\" Matt asked. \"It\u0027ll be great to hear something other than Trevor\u0027s bogus stories for once.\"\\n\\n I stared at the happy couple--Cupid\u0027s newest bull\u0027s-eyes.\\n\\n \"Trevor was right. The Sterlings really are vampires,\" I said impulsively.\\n\\n They stared at me like I was crazy. Then they burst into laughter.\\n\\n I, too, laughed and then walked away.\\n\\n I packed my suitcase full of black garments, unsure of what I was preparing for. To be safe I also packed a clove of garlic in Tupperware, Ruby\u0027s compact, and a can of Mace.\\n\\n To calm my nerves, I opened my Olivia Outcast journal and made a list of Positives of Dating a Vampire:\\n\\n 1. He\u0027ll be around for eternity.\\n\\n 2. He can always fly for free.\\n\\n 3. I\u0027ll save hundreds of dollars on wedding photos.\\n\\n 4. No mirrors to Windex. 5. He\u0027ll never have garlic breath.\\n\\n I closed my journal. I had one more thing to pack.\\n\\n I opened the door to my brother\u0027s room. Billy was tapping his skinny fingers on his computer keyboard.\\n\\n \"What do. you want?\" he snapped when I peeked in.\\n\\n \"Want? It\u0027s not what I want, but rather what I have to give. I picked this up after school today from Software City. They said it was the latest.\"\\n\\n I showed him Wrestling Maniacs 3.\\n\\n \"Did you steal it?\"\\n\\n \"Of course not--I may be weird, but I\u0027m not a thief!\"\\n\\n He reached for the game, but I held it firm. \"I just need one thing in return.\"\\n\\n He rolled his eyes. \"I knew it!\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s just teensy-weensy.\"\\n\\n \"Answers to a test?\" he guessed.\\n\\n \"Not this time.\"\\n\\n \"Need a paper written?\"\\n\\n \"Not yet.\"\\n\\n \"Then what?\"\\n\\n \"I need a fake ID,\" I whispered. \"Aunt Libby is not going to take you to a bar!\"\\n\\n \"Of course she\u0027s not. But it\u0027s really for identification, since I won\u0027t have my driver\u0027s license for a few months.\"\\n\\n \"Use your school ID, then.\"\\n\\n \"I need to be eighteen!\" I started to shout. Then I took a deep breath. \"There\u0027s a library convention, and I need to be eighteen to check out books.\"\\n\\n \"Whatever! Mom and Dad will kill you! You\u0027re too young to drink.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not going to drink. I just want to hang out.\"\\n\\n \"What would Alexander say if he found that you were going cruising without him?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m hoping to meet him there,\" I whispered.\\n\\n \"I knew it! You couldn\u0027t care less about \u0027my favorite aunt Libby,\u0027 \" he said in a girlie voice.\\n\\n \"Pretty please?\" I asked, dangling the game before his computer-strained eyes.\\n\\n \"Well...\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027ll make it?\"\\n\\n \"No, but I know someone who will.\"\\n\\n For the first time ever I walked my brother to school--Dullsville Middle. The redbrick building, front lawn, and playground looked surprisingly smaller than when I had attended several years ago. \"I used to skip class and hide out over there,\" I said, pointing to a small athletics equipment shed.\\n\\n \"I know,\" he said. \"\u0027Raven was here\u0027 is scratched all over the side.\"\\n\\n \"I guess I skipped more than I thought,\" I said with a grin.\\n\\n I felt like a towering gothic giant as I walked up the front lawn among girls sporting Bratz T-shirts and Strawberry Shortcake notebooks and boys with overstuffed Pokemon backpacks.\\n\\n I figured we were meeting a corrupt shop teacher, but instead we were greeted at the entrance by an eleven-year-old red-haired wunderkind named Henry.\\n\\n \"What do you need to make fake IDs for?\" I asked him. \"Getting into Chuck E. Cheese\u0027s after hours?\"\\n\\n Billy Boy\u0027s friend gazed up at me, like he\u0027d never seen a real girl up close.\\n\\n \"You can stare at my picture after you take it,\" I joked.\\n\\n \"Follow me,\" he said.\\n\\n In the hallway we were stopped by Mrs. Hanley, my sixth grade math teacher.\\n\\n \"Raven Madison! You look so grown up!\"\\n\\n I could tell she had expected me to wind up in juvie hall or shipped off to a boarding school. She stared at my brother and me, obviously wondering how two such different human beings could come from the same shared DNA.\\n\\n \"I never realized Billy was your brother,\" she confessed. \"I know,\" I whispered. \"I\u0027m amazed, too.\"\\n\\n \"Well, some things haven\u0027t changed,\" she said, walking off. She kept looking back as if she had seen an apparition. I knew who\u0027d be the subject of today\u0027s talk around the microwave in the teachers\u0027 lounge.\\n\\n We stopped at Henry\u0027s locker, the only one with a combination lock that was hooked up to a garage door opener. Henry flipped the control switch and the combo lock sprung open. Computer games, electronics, and programming manuals were organized in racks like a miniature computer store.\\n\\n He pulled out a digital camera hidden underneath a shelf.\\n\\n \"Let\u0027s go.\"\\n\\n I followed them around the corner to the computer room. But it was locked. My heart sank.\\n\\n \"This can\u0027t happen! Break a window if you have to,\" I said, half jokingly.\\n\\n Both geeky preteens looked at me as if I were the odd one.\\n\\n Henry dug into the back pocket of his chinos and pulled out a worn brown leather wallet. He opened it and got out a credit card. He slid the card into the door, jiggled it a little, and within a moment the door slipped open.\\n\\n \"I like your style,\" I said with a smile.\\n\\n Twenty minutes later I was staring at an eighteen-year-old Raven. \"I look good for my age,\" I said with a wink, and headed for home. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/kissing-coffins-vampire-kisses-2/page-3.html","bookId":1867,"book":{"id":1867,"title":"Kissing Coffins (Vampire Kisses #2)","description":"Storyline: Kissing Coffins (Vampire Kisses #2) \\n Not far from Dullsville, someone\u0027s lurking in the dark. . . . \\n After meeting the handsome and shadowy Alexander Sterling, goth-girl Raven\u0027s dark world has a bright, new glow.
