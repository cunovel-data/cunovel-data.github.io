I headed through downtown Dullsville in the pouring rain where drivers in their Saabs, Mercedeses, and Jeeps looked strangely at the sight of a miserable, soaking wet goth girl. I ran down the main street and tore through shoppers with umbrellas, knocked into couples coming out of the movie theater, and barreled past patrons escaping from the rain into restaurants. With every flap of a bird\u0027s wing or sound of a honking horn, I was startled, thinking it was Jagger following me. I raced on. I didn\u0027t want to go home. I needed to be alone, away from my family. I didn\u0027t want to talk--no one, not even Becky, would understand this unearthly experience. I had to hide out and seek comfort in the only place I had ever really felt at home. I hurried through the open Mansion gates, my legs numb and my feet tingly inside my boots. I rushed up the long, windy driveway and around to the back of the Mansion. I glanced toward the gazebo to see if any two-colored eyeballs were staring back at me. When I found the gazebo empty, I climbed through the open basement window and made my way through the deserted Mansion. My tears dropped onto the creaky wooden floors beneath my squeaky boots. I wiped my eyes as I ascended the grand staircase and made my way into Alexander\u0027s attic room. I touched the empty easel. I gazed at his bed, still creased from when he\u0027d slept there days ago. I held his black knit sweater left behind on his beaten-up comfy chair. I walked to the attic window and gazed out into the lonely moonlight. The heavy rain had ceased. I felt exhausted, abandoned, like a complete failure. Had I just stayed in Dullsville, Alexander would have returned for me. But my impatience had put me, and Alexander, in danger. He had been safely hiding in Dullsville from Jagger\u0027s thirsty revenge, and I\u0027d pointed his nemesis right in his direction. As clever as I thought I was, I\u0027d just been a pawn in Jagger\u0027s wicked game. I heard a floorboard creak behind me. I slowly turned around but could barely make out the dark figure standing in the doorway. \"Jagger--\" I said with a gasp. The floorboard creaked again as the figure took a step toward me. \"Get out!\" I yelled, backing up. I had nowhere to go. The figure was blocking the doorway, and my only escape was the narrow attic window ledge. I stepped away, anxious about making a dangerous escape. \"I\u0027ll call the police!\" I warned. The figure drew closer. I decided I\u0027d have to make a run for it by going around him. I took a breath and counted to myself. One. Two. Three. I speedily darted around the figure, and was close to making my escape through the doorway when the figure grabbed my wrist. \"Get off!\" I cried, trying to wriggle away. But when the moonlight gleamed down on his hand, a black plastic spider ring shined back at me. I gasped, ceasing my struggle. \"Alexander?\" He stepped completely into the light. There he was, like a dream, standing before me. He\u0027d returned. Handsome and now weary looking. \"I thought I\u0027d never see you again!\" I exclaimed. My body, tense with fear, melted into him as I wrapped my arms around him. He squeezed me back, so hard I could almost feel his heart beat through my own chest. \"I\u0027m not letting go,\" I said, squeezing him harder and smiling. \"Not ever!\" \"I shouldn\u0027t have...,\" he began, softly. I looked up, as if I were seeing an apparition. \"I just can\u0027t believe you\u0027re here!\" He took my hands and raised them to his mouth, kissing the back of them with his full lips, sending shivers through my veins. He gazed back into my eyes and smiled. And then he did what I had so longed for him to do. He kissed me. His full lips pressed tenderly against mine, slowly, softly, seductively. It was as if we\u0027d been separated for an eternity. We continued to kiss, passionately, moving from our mouths to our cheeks to our ears as if drinking in each other\u0027s flesh. He gently stroked my hair, then nibbled my ear. I giggled as he sat on his comfy chair and pulled me onto his lap. I looked into his eyes, wondering how I could have breathed the last few days without him near me. I ran my fingers through his messy, licorice-colored locks. He brushed my hair away from my neck and made his way up my shoulder with sexy kisses. I could feel his teeth, seductively sliding against the skin of my neck. Touching, toying, tingling, giving me playful nibbles. The nape of my neck hung tenderly in his mouth. Suddenly Alexander pulled away, a look of terror in his eyes. \"I can\u0027t,\" he said shamefully, looking away. \"What\u0027s wrong?\" I asked, surprised by his change in mood. Alexander stood up, helping me to my feet. He anxiously drew his hand through his hair and paced the room. \"It\u0027s okay,\" I said, catching up to him by his easel. \"I thought I wasn\u0027t like Jagger,\" he said, and sat on the edge of his bed. \"But...maybe I am.\" \"You are nothing like him,\" I said. \"In fact, you are the opposite.\" \"I just want you to be safe. Always,\" he said, looking at me soulfully. \"I am, now that you are here,\" I said, stroking his hand. \"But don\u0027t you see?\" he said seriously. \"My world is not a safe one.\" \"Well, mine isn\u0027t either. Don\u0027t you watch the news?\" His sullen face turned bright, and he laughed. \"I guess you\u0027re right.\" \"See? I\u0027m more at risk going to school with Trevor than I am kissing a vampire.\" \"I\u0027ve never met anyone like you,\" he said, turning toward me. \"And I\u0027ve never felt before the way I feel about you.\" \"I\u0027m so glad you came back for me.\" I hugged him around his waist. \"This won\u0027t happen again,\" he assured me. \"How can you be so sure? Jagger seems bent on getting even with you,\" I asked, sitting beside him. \"Because he couldn\u0027t get even.\" \"Wow, so you showed him who\u0027s boss? Like in a school yard brawl?\" \"I guess...Only in our case it was a graveyard brawl.\" \"Is he gone?\" \"His family is in Romania. There is nothing for him here now. He can go back and tell them he found me.\" I fingered my necklace. \"What promise did you break?\" \"I didn\u0027t break it. I never made it...But we don\u0027t have to worry about that anymore,\" he said wearily. \"What were all the candles in the cemetery for?\" I asked. \"A vampire can take anyone at any time. But if he takes another at a cemetery or some other sacred ground, then she is his for eternity.\" \"Then I\u0027m glad you showed up when you did!\" I squeezed Alexander with all my might. \"I\u0027m sorry I led Jagger to you,\" I confessed. \"I should be the one apologizing to you. I couldn\u0027t imagine you\u0027d come for me,\" he said, staring off into the moonlight. Then he turned back to me. \"But I should have known. That\u0027s what I love about you.\" \"Now tell me everything!\" I exclaimed suddenly. \"What\u0027s it like being a--?\" \"What\u0027s it like being human?\" he interrupted. \"Boring.\" \"How can you say that?\" he asked, holding me close. \"You can wake up in the daylight, go to school, and see your reflection.\" \"But I want to be like you.\" \"You already are,\" he said with a smile. \"Were you born a vampire?\" \"Yes. Were you born a human?\" he teased. \"Yes. Are there millions of vampires around?\" He nodded. \"But we are a minority, so we like to stick together. Obviously there is safety in numbers. We can\u0027t reveal our identities or we\u0027d be persecuted.\" \"It must be so hard to cover up who you really are inside.\" \"It\u0027s very lonely, feeling like an outcast. Like you are invited to a costume party, but you are the only one in a mask.\" \"Do you have a lot of vampire friends in Romania? I bet you miss them.\" \"My dad procures art for his galleries in several countries. So we traveled quite a bit. By the time I made a friend, it was time to leave.\" \"What about humans, like me?\" I asked, curling up next to him. \"There is no one like you, vampire or not,\" he said with a warm smile. \"It\u0027s hard making human friends when you don\u0027t attend school, and it\u0027s even harder keeping them when they\u0027re eating their evening dinner and you are just rolling out of bed.\" \"Are your parents upset that you have a human girlfriend?\" \"No. If they met you, they would immediately fall in love with you, just like I did,\" he said, and stroked my hair. \"I\u0027d love to travel and live in the nighttime and sleep during the day. Your world seems so romantic. Being bonded to one another for an eternity...Flying off into the night together. Thirsting for no one but each other.\" \"I feel that way about your world.\" \"The grass is always greener, I guess. Or, in our case, blacker.\" \"When I\u0027m with you,\" he began, \"I don\u0027t care which world we are in, just as long as we\u0027re in the same one together.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/kissing-coffins-vampire-kisses-2/page-12.html","bookId":1867,"book":{"id":1867,"title":"Kissing Coffins (Vampire Kisses #2)","description":"Storyline: Kissing Coffins (Vampire Kisses #2) Not far from Dullsville, someone\u0027s lurking in the dark. . . .
