{"id":82373,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"\"Mom, I\u0027m not going to Siberia. I\u0027ll be back in two days.\" We were sitting at Dullsville\u0027s Greyhound bus stop, outside Shirley\u0027s Ice Cream Parlor. She was trying to strangle me with kisses when the bus squealed to the curb in front of a few other young Dullsvillians heading out early for spring break.\n As the bus pulled away and I waved good-bye from my window seat in the back, I actually felt a pang in my stomach. This would be my first trip away from Dullsville on my own. I even wondered if I would return.\n I sat back, closed my eyes, and thought what it would be like if I became Alexander\u0027s vampiress.\n I imagined Alexander waiting for me at Hipsterville\u0027s bus stop, standing in the rain, wearing tight black jeans and a glow-in-the-dark Jack Skellington shirt, a small bouquet of black roses in one hand. Upon seeing me, his pale face would flush with just enough pink to make him look alive. He\u0027d take my hand in his, lean into me, and kiss me long. He would whisk me off in his restored vintage hearse, adorned with painted spiders and cobwebs, the music of Slipknot blasting from the speakers.\n We\u0027d park in front of an abandoned castle and climb the creaky spiral stairs that led to the desolate tower. The ancient castle walls would be lined with black lace and the rustic wooden floors sprinkled with rose petals. A million candles would flicker around the room, the skinny medieval windows barely letting in moonlight. \"I couldn\u0027t be without you anymore,\" Alexander would say. He would lean into me and take my neck into his mouth. I\u0027d feel a slight pressure on my flesh. I\u0027d become dizzy, but feel more alive than I\u0027d ever felt before--my head would slump back, my body become limp in his arms. My heart would pulse in overtime as if beating for both of us. Out of the corner of my eye, I would be able to see Alexander lift his head proudly.\n He\u0027d gently let me down. I\u0027d feel lightheaded and stumble to my feet, holding my red-stained neck as the blood trickled down my forearm.\n I\u0027d be able to feel two pointy fangs with the tip of my tongue.\n He would open a tower window to reveal the sleeping town. I\u0027d be able to see things I\u0027d never seen before, like smiling ghosts floating above the houses.\n Alexander would take my hand, and we would fly off into the night, above the sparkling lights of the town and beneath the twinkling stars, like two gothic angels.\n The sound of clanging bells interrupted. Not the tinkling of bells signaling my arrival into the Underworld, but rather a railroad crossing warning of an incoming train, signaling the end of my overactive imagination. The bus was stopped in front of a railroad track. A toddler in the seat across the aisle from me waved excitedly as the black engine approached.\n \"Chug-a-chug-a-choo-choo!\" he exclaimed. \"I want to be a conductor,\" he proclaimed to his mother.\n I, too, stared as the conductor waved his blue hat while the train began to pass us. Instead of new boxcars whizzing by us, a string of dilapidated, graffiti-laden freight cars lagged in front of us. Like the toddler across from me, who was likely dreaming of the glamorous life of a conductor--too naive to realize the demands of the job, isolation, long hours, and little pay--I, too, wondered if my dream of becoming a vampire was more romantic than its reality. I was stepping into a world of the unknown, knowing only one thing: I had to find Alexander.\n The official welcome sign to Aunt Libby\u0027s town should read, \"Welcome to Hipsterville--Inhabitants must check all golf pants at the city limits.\" The small town was an eclectic mix of hip coffee shops, upscale secondhand stores, and indie cinemas where all forms of cool people presided-- granola heads, artists, goths, and chic freaks. Every kind was acceptable here. I could see why Alexander and Jameson might have escaped to this particular town. It was in close proximity to Dullsville and they could easily blend in with the smorgasbord of other motley inhabitants.\n I could only imagine what my life would have been like if I had grown up in a town where I was more accepted than ostracized. I could have been on the A-list to Friday night \"haunted\" house parties, been crowned Halloween Queen, and received straight A\u0027s in Historical Tombstones class.\n Dad and Aunt Libby had both been hippies in the sixties, but while Dad morphed into a yuppie, Libby stayed true to her inner Deadhead. She had moved to Hipsterville, majored in theater at the university, and now worked as a waitress in a vegan restaurant to support her acting. She was always performing in an avant-garde play or a performance-art piece in some director\u0027s garage. When I was eleven my family watched her stand onstage for what seemed like days, dressed as a giant snow pea and speaking in broken sentences about how she sprouted.\n When I arrived in Hipsterville, I wasn\u0027t shocked to find that Alexander wasn\u0027t waiting for me, but I was surprised my aunt wasn\u0027t. I hope she isn\u0027t this late for her curtain calls, I thought, as I waited at the bus stop in the hot sun beside my suitcase. Finally I spotted her beat-up vintage yellow Beetle sputtering into the lot. \"You\u0027re so grown up!\" she exclaimed, getting out of her car and giving me a huge hug. \"But you dress the same. I was counting on that.\"\n Aunt Libby had a youthful face, decorated with sparkling purple eye shadow and pink lipstick. She wore red dangly crystal earrings beneath her auburn hair, a sky blue halter dress spotted with white beads, and beige Nairobi sandals.\n Her warmth spilled over me. Even though we differed in our tastes, we immediately bonded like sisters, talking about fashion, music, and movies.\n \"Kissing Coffins?\" she asked when I told her what I recently watched. \"That\u0027s like The Rocky Horror Picture Show. I remember going to the midnight show and dancing in the aisles. \u0027Let\u0027s do the time warp again,\u0027 \" Aunt Libby sang, as passersby gave us strange looks.\n \"Uh, Kissing Coffins isn\u0027t a musical,\" I interrupted before my aunt got a citation for disturbing the peace.\n \"Isn\u0027t that a shame. Well, I\u0027ve got a great place to take you,\" she raved, and led me around the block to Hot Gothics.\n \"Wow!\" I shouted, pointing to a pair of black patent-leather boots and a torn black mesh sweater. \"I\u0027ve only seen this store on the Internet.\"\n I was in goth heaven, and it was beautiful! Wicked Wiccas T- shirts, Hello Batty comics, and fake body tattoos.\n The multipierced fuchsia-haired clerk in black shorts over black leggings, three-inch-heeled Mary Janes, and a gray mechanics shirt that said \"Bob\" walked over to me. She had the kind of style that in Dullsville could be seen only on satellite TV. And instead of my usual retail experience of either being ignored or seen as a potential thief, she greeted me as if I were a movie star at a Beverly Hills boutique.\n \"Can I help you? We have tons of stuff on sale.\" I eagerly followed her around the store until I was exhausted from rack after rack of gothic clothing.\n \"Feel free to ask, if you need anything else,\" she said.\n I had my arms stuffed with fishnet stockings, knee-high black boots, and an Olivia Outcast purse.\n Libby modeled a black T-shirt that read \"Vampires Suck.\"\n I felt a pang in my heart and a lump in my throat.\n \"I\u0027ll buy it for you,\" she insisted, taking it to the cash register.\n Normally I would have screamed with delight at a shirt like that. But now it only reminded me that Alexander was gone.\n \"You don\u0027t have to.\"\n \"Of course I do. I\u0027m your aunt. We\u0027ll take this,\" she said, handing the clerk the shirt and her credit card.\n I held my gothic goodies. Everything reminded me of Alexander.\n \"I\u0027ll just put these back,\" I said. But then I thought about how sexy I\u0027d look in boots and black fishnets, if I found him again.\n \"We\u0027ll get these, too,\" my aunt said, seeing through me, and handed the clerk my merchandise.\n Aunt Libby lived on a tiny tree-lined urban street with skinny row-house apartments from the 1940s--a sharp contrast to my contemporary suburban house and neighborhood in Dullsville. Her one-bedroom apartment was small but cozy, with a bohemian feel-- flowered rugs, pillows, wicker chairs, and lavender potpourri filled the living room. Italian masks decorated the walls and Chinese lanterns hung from the ceiling.\n \"You can crash here,\" Aunt Libby said, pointing to a paisley futon couch in the living room.\n \"Thanks!\" I said, excited about my new digs. \"I appreciate you letting me visit you.\"\n \"I\u0027m so happy you came!\" she replied.\n I placed my suitcase by the futon and glanced at a Pink Floyd clock hanging above the antique \"just for show\" fireplace, which she had filled with unlit candles. I had only a few hours until sunset.\n Libby poured me carrot juice as I unpacked. \"You must be hungry,\" she called from her tiny art deco kitchen. \"You want an avocado wrap?\"\n \"Sure,\" I said, plopping down at her vintage weathered-yellow dinner table with a beaded napkin holder and a wobbly leg. \"I bet you have a hot date tonight,\" I hinted, as she topped my sandwich with sprouts. \"But that\u0027s okay. I can take care of myself.\"\n \"Didn\u0027t your father tell you? I guess he wanted it to be a surprise.\"\n \"Tell me what?\" I asked, envisioning Libby handing me VIP passes to the Coffin Club.\n \"I have a show tonight.\"\n A show? I didn\u0027t travel all the way to Hipsterville to spend three hours sitting in a garage.\n \"It\u0027s downtown,\" she said proudly. \"We\u0027re having a private performance tonight for the town\u0027s senior citizens, so I\u0027m sorry to say you\u0027ll be the only one there without gray hair. But I know you\u0027ll love it.\" She grabbed an envelope hanging on her fridge by a rainbow magnet. She opened the envelope, pulled out a ticket, and presented it to me.\n THE VILLAGE PLAYERS PRESENT\n Dracula\n The Village Players performed in a former elementary school. The actresses\u0027 dressing room was a classroom that still smelled of erasers, and the large windows were covered with heavy shades. Mirrors replaced the chalkboard, and a long vanity lined with makeup cases, flowers, and congratulations cards sat in place of a teacher\u0027s desk.\n As Aunt Libby applied her makeup and squirmed into her white Victorian dress, I spun a forgotten globe in the corner, letting a black- painted fingernail come to a rest on Romania.\n Of course, under any other circumstances I would have loved to see a performance of Dracula. I would have gone every night, especially to see my aunt as an admittedly old, but I\u0027m sure convincing, Lucy. I would have ordered front-row seats. But why would I want to see a fake Dracula when I could see the real thing sipping a Bloody Mary down the street at the Coffin Club?\n The stage manager called from the hallway, \"Five minutes.\"\n I hugged Libby and told her to break a leg. I hoped she wouldn\u0027t notice my empty seat during the performance, but I couldn\u0027t worry about that as I hurried up the aisle to the back of the theater.\n I pulled aside an elderly usher who looked like he might be one of the undead. \"Which way to the Coffin Club?\" Some people spend all their lives searching for their soul mates. I had only an hour and a half to find mine. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/kissing-coffins-vampire-kisses-2/page-4.html","bookId":1867,"book":{"id":1867,"title":"Kissing Coffins (Vampire Kisses #2)","description":"Storyline: \n Kissing Coffins (Vampire Kisses #2) \n Not far from Dullsville, someone\u0027s lurking in the dark. . . . \n After meeting the handsome and shadowy Alexander Sterling, goth-girl Raven\u0027s dark world has a bright, new glow.
