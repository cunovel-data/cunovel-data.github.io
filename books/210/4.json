{"id":6518,"no":4,"title":"Chapter 4 Johnson As A Literary Dictator","content":"We have now reached the point at which Johnson\u0027s life becomes distinctly visible through the eyes of a competent observer. The last twenty years are those which are really familiar to us; and little remains but to give some brief selection of Boswell\u0027s anecdotes. The task, however, is a difficult one. It is easy enough to make a selection of the gems of Boswell\u0027s narrative; but it is also inevitable that, taken from their setting, they should lose the greatest part of their brilliance. We lose all the quaint semiconscious touches of character which make the original so fascinating; and Boswell\u0027s absurdities become less amusing when we are able to forget for an instant that the perpetrator is also the narrator. The effort, however, must be made; and it will be best to premise a brief statement of the external conditions of the life. \\n\\n Johnson\u0027s habitual mode of life is described by Dr. Maxwell, one of Boswell\u0027s friends, who made his acquaintance in 1754. Maxwell generally called upon him about twelve, and found him in bed or declaiming over his tea. A levée, chiefly of literary men, surrounded him; and he seemed to be regarded as a kind of oracle to whom every one might resort for advice or instruction. After talking all the morning, he dined at a tavern, staying late and then going to some friend\u0027s house for tea, over which he again loitered for a long time. Maxwell is puzzled to know when he could have read or written. The answer seems to be pretty obvious; namely, that after the publication of the Dictionary he wrote very little, and that, when he did write, it was generally in a brief spasm of feverish energy. One may understand that Johnson should have frequently reproached himself for his indolence; though he seems to have occasionally comforted himself by thinking that he could do good by talking as well as by writing. He said that a man should have a part of his life to himself; and compared himself to a physician retired to a small town from practice in a great city. Boswell, in spite of this, said that he still wondered that Johnson had not more pleasure in writing than in not writing. \"Sir,\" replied the oracle, \"you may wonder.\" \\n\\n Boswell was drinking tea with Davies and his wife in their back parlour when Johnson came into the shop. Davies, seeing him through the glass-door, announced his approach to Boswell in the spirit of Horatio addressing Hamlet: \"Look, my Lord, it comes!\" Davies introduced the young Scotchman, who remembered Johnson\u0027s proverbial prejudices. \"Don\u0027t tell him where I come from!\" cried Boswell. \"From Scotland,\" said Davies roguishly. \"Mr. Johnson,\" said Boswell, \"I do indeed come from Scotland; but I cannot help it!\" \"That, sir,\" was the first of Johnson\u0027s many retorts to his worshipper, \"is what a great many of your countrymen cannot help.\" \\n\\n So friendly had the pair become, that when Boswell left England to continue his studies at Utrecht, Johnson accompanied him in the stagecoach to Harwich, amusing him on the way by his frankness of address to fellow-passengers, and by the voracity of his appetite. He gave him some excellent advice, remarking of a moth which fluttered into a candle, \"that creature was its own tormentor, and I believe its name was Boswell.\" He refuted Berkeley by striking his foot with mighty force against a large stone, till he rebounded from it. As the ship put out to sea Boswell watched him from the deck, whilst he remained \"rolling his majestic frame in his usual manner.\" And so the friendship was cemented, though Boswell disappeared for a time from the scene, travelled on the Continent, and visited Paoli in Corsica. A friendly letter or two kept up the connexion till Boswell returned in 1766, with his head full of Corsica and a projected book of travels. \\n\\n In the next year, 1767, occurred an incident upon which Boswell dwells with extreme complacency. Johnson was in the habit of sometimes reading in the King\u0027s Library, and it came into the head of his majesty that he should like to see the uncouth monster upon whom he had bestowed a pension. In spite of his semi-humorous Jacobitism, there was probably not a more loyal subject in his majesty\u0027s dominions. Loyalty is a word too often used to designate a sentiment worthy only of valets, advertising tradesmen, and writers of claptrap articles. But it deserves all respect when it reposes, as in Johnson\u0027s case, upon a profound conviction of the value of political subordination, and an acceptance of the king as the authorized representative of a great principle. There was no touch of servility in Johnson\u0027s respect for his sovereign, a respect fully reconcilable with a sense of his own personal dignity. Johnson spoke of his interview with an unfeigned satisfaction, which it would be difficult in these days to preserve from the taint of snobbishness. He described it frequently to his friends, and Boswell with pious care ascertained the details from Johnson himself, and from various secondary sources. He contrived afterwards to get his minute submitted to the King himself, who graciously authorized its publication. When he was preparing his biography, he published this account with the letter to Chesterfield in a small pamphlet sold at a prohibitory price, in order to secure the copyright. \\n\\n The years 1768 and 1769 were a period of great excitement for Boswell. He was carrying on various love affairs, which ended with his marriage in the end of 1769. He was publishing his book upon Corsica and paying homage to Paoli, who arrived in England in the autumn of the same year. The book appeared in the beginning of 1768, and he begs his friend Temple to report all that is said about it, but with the restriction that he is to conceal all censure. He particularly wanted Gray\u0027s opinion, as Gray was a friend of Temple\u0027s. Gray\u0027s opinion, not conveyed to Boswell, was expressed by his calling it \"a dialogue between a green goose and a hero.\" Boswell, who was cultivating the society of various eminent people, exclaims triumphantly in a letter to Temple (April 26, 1768), \"I am really the great man now.\" Johnson and Hume had called upon him on the same day, and Garrick, Franklin, and Oglethorpe also partook of his \"admirable dinners and good claret.\" \"This,\" he says, with the sense that he deserved his honours, \"is enjoying the fruit of my labours, and appearing like the friend of Paoli.\" Johnson in vain expressed a wish that he would \"empty his head of Corsica, which had filled it too long.\" \"Empty my head of Corsica! Empty it of honour, empty it of friendship, empty it of piety!\" exclaims the ardent youth. The next year accordingly saw Boswell\u0027s appearance at the Stratford Jubilee, where he paraded to the admiration of all beholders in a costume described by himself (apparently) in a glowing article in the London Magazine. \"Is it wrong, sir,\" he took speedy opportunity of inquiring from the oracle, \"to affect singularity in order to make people stare?\" \"Yes,\" replied Johnson, \"if you do it by propagating error, and indeed it is wrong in any way. There is in human nature a general inclination to make people stare, and every wise man has himself to cure of it, and does cure himself. If you wish to make people stare by doing better than others, why make them stare till they stare their eyes out. But consider how easy it is to make people stare by being absurd\"—a proposition which he proceeds to illustrate by examples perhaps less telling than Boswell\u0027s recent performance. \\n\\n Johnson and Boswell had several meetings in 1769. Boswell had the honour of introducing the two objects of his idolatry, Johnson and Paoli, and on another occasion entertained a party including Goldsmith and Garrick and Reynolds, at his lodgings in Old Bond Street. We can still see the meeting more distinctly than many that have been swallowed by a few days of oblivion. They waited for one of the party, Johnson kindly maintaining that six ought to be kept waiting for one, if the one would suffer more by the others sitting down than the six by waiting. Meanwhile Garrick \"played round Johnson with a fond vivacity, taking hold of the breasts of his coat, looking up in his face with a lively archness,\" and complimenting him on his good health. Goldsmith strutted about bragging of his dress, of which Boswell, in the serene consciousness of superiority to such weakness, thought him seriously vain. \"Let me tell you,\" said Goldsmith, \"when my tailor brought home my bloom-coloured coat, he said, \u0027Sir, I have a favour to beg of you; when anybody asks you who made your clothes, be pleased to mention John Filby, at the Harrow, Water Lane.\u0027\" \"Why, sir,\" said Johnson, \"that was because he knew that the strange colour would attract crowds to gaze at it, and thus they might hear of him, and see how well he could make a coat even of so absurd a colour.\" Mr. Filby has gone the way of all tailors and bloomcoloured coats, but some of his bills are preserved. On the day of this dinner he had delivered to Goldsmith a half-dress suit of ratteen lined with satin, costing twelve guineas, a pair of silk stocking-breeches for ￡2 5s. and a pair of bloom-coloured ditto for ￡1 4s. 6d. The bill, including other items, was paid, it is satisfactory to add, in February, 1771. \\n\\n The conversation was chiefly literary. Johnson repeated the concluding lines of the Dunciad; upon which some one (probably Boswell) ventured to say that they were \"too fine for such a poem—a poem on what?\" \\n\\n When they got to Temple Bar Goldsmith pointed to the heads of the Jacobites upon it and slily suggested,— Forsitan et nostrum nomen miscebitur istis. \\n\\n After more talk the gentlemen went to the Club; and poor Boswell remained trembling with an anxiety which even the claims of Lady Di Beauclerk\u0027s conversation could not dissipate. The welcome news of his election was brought; and Boswell went to see Burke for the first time, and to receive a humorous charge from Johnson, pointing out the conduct expected from him as a good member. Perhaps some hints were given as to betrayal of confidence. Boswell seems at any rate to have had a certain reserve in repeating Club talk. \\n\\n The precise point, however, upon which he rested his case, was the tangible one of the inability of Macpherson to produce the manuscripts of which he had affirmed the existence. MacPherson wrote a furious letter to Johnson, of which the purport can only be inferred from Johnson\u0027s smashing retort,— \"Mr. James MacPherson, I have received your foolish and impudent letter. Any violence offered me I shall do my best to repel; and what I cannot do for myself, the law shall do for me. I hope I shall never be deterred from detecting what I think a cheat by the menaces of a ruffian. \\n\\n \"What would you have me retract? I thought your book an imposture: I think it an imposture still. For this opinion I have given my reasons to the public, which I here dare you to refute. Your rage I defy. Your abilities, since your Homer, are not so formidable; and what I hear of your morals inclines me to pay regard not to what you shall say, but to what you shall prove. You may print this if you will. \\n\\n \"SAM. JOHNSON.\" \\n\\n And so laying in a tremendous cudgel, the old gentleman (he was now sixty-six) awaited the assault, which, however, was not delivered. \\n\\n In 1775 Boswell again came to London, and renewed some of the Scotch discussions. He attended a meeting of the Literary Club, and found the members disposed to laugh at Johnson\u0027s tenderness to the stories about second-sight. Boswell heroically avowed his own belief. \"The evidence,\" he said, \"is enough for me, though not for his great mind. What will not fill a quart bottle, will fill a pint bottle. I am filled with belief.\" \"Are you?\" said Colman; \"then cork it p.\" \\n\\n It was during this and the next few years that Boswell laboured most successfully in gathering materials for his book. In 1777 he only met Johnson in the country. In 1779, for some unexplained reason, he was lazy in making notes; in 1780 and 1781 he was absent from London; and in the following year, Johnson was visibly declining. The tenour of Johnson\u0027s life was interrupted during this period by no remarkable incidents, and his literary activity was not great, although the composition of the Lives of the Poets falls between 1777 and 1780. His mind, however, as represented by his talk, was in full vigour. I will take in order of time a few of the passages recorded by Boswell, which may serve for various reasons to afford the best illustration of his character. Yet it may be worth while once more to repeat the warning that such fragments moved from their context must lose most of their charm. \\n\\n On March 26th (1775), Boswell met Johnson at the house of the publisher, Strahan. Strahan reminded Johnson of a characteristic remark which he had formerly made, that there are \"few ways in which a man can be more innocently employed than in getting money.\" On another occasion Johnson observed with equal truth, if less originality, that cultivating kindness was an important part of life, as well as money-making. Johnson then asked to see a country lad whom he had recommended to Strahan as an apprentice. He asked for five guineas on account, that he might give one to the boy. \"Nay, if a man recommends a boy and does nothing for him, it is sad work.\" A \"little, thick short-legged boy\" was accordingly brought into the courtyard, whither Johnson and Boswell descended, and the lexicographer bending himself down administered some good advice to the awestruck lad with \"slow and sonorous solemnity,\" ending by the presentation of the guinea. \\n\\n In the evening the pair formed part of a corps of party \"wits,\" led by Sir Joshua Reynolds, to the benefit of Mrs. Abingdon, who had been a frequent model of the painter. Johnson praised Garrick\u0027s prologues, and Boswell kindly reported the eulogy to Garrick, with whom he supped at Beauclerk\u0027s. Garrick treated him to a mimicry of Johnson, repeating, \"with pauses and half-whistling,\" the lines,— Os homini sublime dedit—coelumque tueri Jussit—et erectos ad sidera tollere vultus: \\n\\n looking downwards, and at the end touching the ground with a contorted gesticulation. Garrick was generally jealous of Johnson\u0027s light opinion of him, and used to take off his old master, saying, \"Davy has some convivial pleasantry about him, but \u0027tis a futile fellow.\" \\n\\n Next day, at Thrales\u0027, Johnson fell foul of Gray, one of his pet aversions. Boswell denied that Gray was dull in poetry. \"Sir,\" replied Johnson, \"he was dull in company, dull in his closet, dull everywhere. He was dull in a new way, and that made people think him great. He was a mechanical poet.\" He proceeded to say that there were only two good stanzas in the Elegy. Johnson\u0027s criticism was perverse; but if we were to collect a few of the judgments passed by contemporaries upon each other, it would be scarcely exceptional in its want of appreciation. It is rather odd to remark that Gray was generally condemned for obscurity—a charge which seems strangely out of place when he is measured by more recent standards. \\n\\n The day after, Boswell won a bet from Lady Di Beauclerk by venturing to ask Johnson what he did with the orange-peel which he used to pocket. Johnson received the question amicably, but did not clear the mystery. \"Then,\" said Boswell, \"the world must be left in the dark. It must be said, he scraped them, and he let them dry, but what he did with them next he never could be prevailed upon to tell.\" \"Nay, sir,\" replied Johnson, \"you should say it more imphatically—he could not be prevailed upon, even by his dearest friends to tell.\" \\n\\n The talk went on to patriotism, and Johnson laid down an apophthegm, at \"which many will start,\" many people, in fact, having little sense of humour. Such persons may be reminded for their comfort that at this period patriot had a technical meaning. \"Patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel.\" On the 10th of April, he laid down another dogma, calculated to offend the weaker brethren. He defended Pope\u0027s line— Man never is but always to be blest. \\n\\n And being asked if man did not sometimes enjoy a momentary happiness, replied, \"Never, but when he is drunk.\" It would be useless to defend these and other such utterances to any one who cannot enjoy them without defence. \\n\\n On April 11th, the pair went in Reynolds\u0027s coach to dine with Cambridge, at Twickenham. Johnson was in high spirits. He remarked as they drove down, upon the rarity of good humour in life. One friend mentioned by Boswell was, he said, acid, and another muddy. At last, stretching himself and turning with complacency, he observed, \"I look upon myself as a good-humoured fellow\"—a bit of self-esteem against which Boswell protested. Johnson, he admitted, was good-natured; but was too irascible and impatient to be good-humoured. On reaching Cambridge\u0027s house, Johnson ran to look at the books. \"Mr. Johnson,\" said Cambridge politely, \"I am going with your pardon to accuse myself, for I have the same custom which I perceive you have. But it seems odd that one should have such a desire to look at the backs of books.\" \"Sir,\" replied Johnson, wheeling about at the words, \"the reason is very plain. Knowledge is of two kinds. We know a subject ourselves, or we know where we can find information upon it. When we inquire into any subject, the first thing we have to do is to know what books have treated of it. This leads us to look at catalogues, and the backs of books in libraries.\" \\n\\n A pleasant talk followed. Johnson denied the value attributed to historical reading, on the ground that we know very little except a few facts and dates. All the colouring, he said, was conjectural. Boswell chuckles over the reflection that Gibbon, who was present, did not take up the cudgels for his favourite study, though the first-fruits of his labours were to appear in the following year. \"Probably he did not like to trust himself with Johnson.\" \\n\\n The conversation presently turned upon the Beggar\u0027s Opera, and Johnson sensibly refused to believe that any man had been made a rogue by seeing it. Yet the moralist felt bound to utter some condemnation of such a performance, and at last, amidst the smothered amusement of the company, collected himself to give a heavy stroke: \"there is in it,\" he said, \"such a labefactation of all principles as may he dangerous to morality.\" \\n\\n A discussion followed as to whether Sheridan was right for refusing to allow his wife to continue as a public singer. Johnson defended him \"with all the high spirit of a Roman senator.\" \"He resolved wisely and nobly, to be sure. He is a brave man. Would not a gentleman be disgraced by having his wife sing publicly for hire? No, sir, there can be no doubt here. I know not if I should not prepare myself for a public singer as readily as let my wife be one.\" \\n\\n The stout old supporter of social authority went on to denounce the politics of the day. He asserted that politics had come to mean nothing but the art of rising in the world. He contrasted the absence of any principles with the state of the national mind during the stormy days of the seventeenth century. This gives the pith of Johnston\u0027s political prejudices. He hated Whigs blindly from his cradle; but he justified his hatred on the ground that they were now all \"bottomless Whigs,\" that is to say, that pierce where you would, you came upon no definite creed, but only upon hollow formulae, intended as a cloak for private interest. If Burke and one or two of his friends be excepted, the remark had but too much justice. \\n\\n In 1776, Boswell found Johnson rejoicing in the prospect of a journey to Italy with the Thrales. Before starting he was to take a trip to the country, in which Boswell agreed to join. Boswell gathered up various bits of advice before their departure. One seems to have commended itself to him as specially available for practice. \"A man who had been drinking freely,\" said the moralist, \"should never go into a new company. He would probably strike them as ridiculous, though he might be in unison with those who had been drinking with him.\" Johnson propounded another favourite theory. \"A ship,\" he said, \"was worse than a gaol. There is in a gaol better air, better company, better conveniency of every kind; and a ship has the additional disadvantage of being in danger.\" \\n\\n The pair proceeded by post-chaise past Blenheim, and dined at a good inn at Chapelhouse. Johnston boasted of the superiority, long since vanished if it ever existed, of English to French inns, and quoted with great emotion Shenstone\u0027s lines— Whoe\u0027er has travell\u0027d life\u0027s dull round, Where\u0027er his stages may have been, Must sigh to think he still has found The warmest welcome at an inn. \\n\\n They went to Birmingham, where Boswell pumped Hector about Johnson\u0027s early days, and saw the works of Boulton, Watt\u0027s partner, who said to him, \"I sell here, sir, what all the world desires to have—power.\" Thence they went to Lichfield, and met more of the rapidly thinning circle of Johnson\u0027s oldest friends. Here Boswell was a little scandalized by Johnson\u0027s warm exclamation on opening a letter—\"One of the most dreadful things that has happened in my time!\" This turned out to be the death of Thrale\u0027s only son. Boswell thought the phrase too big for the event, and was some time before he could feel a proper concern. He was, however, \"curious to observe how Dr. Johnson would be affected,\" and was again a little scandalized by the reply to his consolatory remark that the Thrales still had daughters. \"Sir,\" said Johnson, \"don\u0027t you know how you yourself think? Sir, he wishes to propagate his name.\" The great man was actually putting the family sentiment of a brewer in the same category with the sentiments of the heir of Auchinleck. Johnson, however, calmed down, but resolved to hurry back to London. They stayed a night at Taylor\u0027s, who remarked that he had fought a good many battles for a physician, one of their common friends. \"But you should consider, sir,\" said Johnson, \"that by every one of your victories he is a loser; for every man of whom you get the better will be very angry, and resolve not to employ him, whereas if people get the better of you in argument about him, they will think \u0027We\u0027ll send for Dr. —— nevertheless!\u0027\" \\n\\n It was after their return to London that Boswell won the greatest triumph of his friendship. He carried through a negotiation, to which, as Burke pleasantly said, there was nothing equal in the whole history of the corps diplomatique. At some moment of enthusiasm it had occurred to him to bring Johnson into company with Wilkes. The infidel demagogue was probably in the mind of the Tory High Churchman, when he threw out that pleasant little apophthegm about patriotism. To bring together two such opposites without provoking a collision would be the crowning triumph of Boswell\u0027s curiosity. He was ready to run all hazards as a chemist might try some new experiment at the risk of a destructive explosion; but being resolved, he took every precaution with admirable foresight. \\n\\n Boswell had been invited by the Dillys, well-known booksellers of the day, to meet Wilkes. \"Let us have Johnson,\" suggested the gallant Boswell. \"Not for the world!\" exclaimed Dilly. But, on Boswell\u0027s undertaking the negotiation, he consented to the experiment. Boswell went off to Johnson and politely invited him in Dilly\u0027s name. \"I will wait upon him,\" said Johnson. \"Provided, sir, I suppose,\" said the diplomatic Boswell, \"that the company which he is to have is agreeable to you.\" \"What do you mean, sir?\" exclaimed Johnson. \"What do you take me for? Do you think I am so ignorant of the world as to prescribe to a gentleman what company he is to have at his table?\" Boswell worked the point a little farther, till, by judicious manipulation, he had got Johnson to commit himself to meeting anybody—even Jack Wilkes, to make a wild hypothesis—at the Dillys\u0027 table. Boswell retired, hoping to think that he had fixed the discussion in Johnson\u0027s mind. \\n\\n Johnson and Wilkes had one point in common—a vigorous prejudice against the Scotch, and upon this topic they cracked their jokes in friendly emulation. When they met upon a later occasion (1781), they still pursued this inexhaustible subject. Wilkes told how a privateer had completely plundered seven Scotch islands, and re-embarked with three and epixpence. Johnson now remarked in answer to somebody who said \"Poor old England is lost!\" \"Sir, it is not so much to be lamented that old England is lost, as that the Scotch have found it.\" \"You must know, sir,\" he said to Wilkes, \"that I lately took my friend Boswell and showed him genuine civilized life in an English provincial town. I turned him loose at Lichfield, that he might see for once real civility, for you know he lives among savages in Scotland and among rakes in London.\" \"Except,\" said Wilkes, \"when he is with grave, sober, decent people like you and me.\" \"And we ashamed of him,\" added Johnson, smiling. \\n\\n In fact, Wilkes had ceased to play any part in public life. When Johnson met him next (in 1781) they joked about such dangerous topics as some of Wilkes\u0027s political performances. Johnson sent him a copy of the Lives, and they were seen conversing tête-à-tête in confidential whispers about George II. and the King of Prussia. To Boswell\u0027s mind it suggested the happy days when the lion should lie down with the kid, or, as Dr. Barnard suggested, the goat. \\n\\n In the year 1777 Johnson began the Lives of the Poets, in compliance with a request from the booksellers, who wished for prefaces to a large collection of English poetry. Johnson asked for this work the extremely modest sum of 200 guineas, when he might easily, according to Malone, have received 1000 or 1500. He did not meet Boswell till September, when they spent ten days together at Dr. Taylor\u0027s. The subject which specially interested Boswell at this time was the fate of the unlucky Dr. Dodd, hanged for forgery in the previous June. Dodd seems to have been a worthless charlatan of the popular preacher variety. His crime would not in our days have been thought worthy of so severe a punishment; but his contemporaries were less shocked by the fact of death being inflicted for such a fault, than by the fact of its being inflicted on a clergyman. Johnson exerted himself to procure a remission of the sentence by writing various letters and petitions on Dodd\u0027s behalf. He seems to have been deeply moved by the man\u0027s appeal, and could \"not bear the thought\" that any negligence of his should lead to the death of a fellow-creature; but he said that if he had himself been in authority he would have signed the death-warrant, and for the man himself, he had as little respect as might be. He said, indeed, that Dodd was right in not joining in the \"cant\" about leaving a wretched world. \"No, no,\" said the poor rogue, \"it has been a very agreeable world to me.\" Dodd had allowed to pass for his own one of the papers composed for him by Johnson, and the Doctor was not quite pleased. When, however, Seward expressed a doubt as to Dodd\u0027s power of writing so forcibly, Johnson felt bound not to expose him. \"Why should you think so? Depend upon it, sir, when any man knows he is to be hanged in a fortnight, it concentrates his mind wonderfully.\" On another occasion, Johnson expressed a doubt himself as to whether Dodd had really composed a certain prayer on the\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/76/249.html","bookId":210,"book":{"id":210,"title":"Samuel Johnson塞缪尔·约翰逊","description":"简介： 塞缪尔·约翰逊(Samuel Johnson),英国作家,批评家。（1709—1784）英国文学史上重要的诗人、散文家、传记家和健谈家，编纂的《词典》对英语发展作出了重大贡献。和琼森一样，他也是当时文坛的...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Celebrity Biographies","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/76","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:24 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:24 AM"}}
