{"id":6517,"no":3,"title":"Chapter 3 Johnsons And His Friends","content":"It is easy to blame them now. Everybody can see that a saint in beggar\u0027s rags is intrinsically better than a sinner in gold lace. But the principle is one of those which serves us for judging the dead, much more than for regulating our own conduct. Those, at any rate, may throw the first stone at the Horace Walpoles and Chesterfields, who are quite certain that they would ask a modern Johnson to their houses. The trial would be severe. Poor Mrs. Boswell complained grievously of her husband\u0027s idolatry. \"I have seen many a bear led by a man,\" she said; \"but I never before saw a man led by a bear.\" The truth is, as Boswell explains, that the sage\u0027s uncouth habits, such as turning the candles\u0027 heads downwards to make them burn more brightly, and letting the wax drop upon the carpet, \"could not but be disagreeable to a lady.\" His appetite for more innocent kinds of food was equally excessive. He would eat seven or eight peaches before breakfast, and declared that he had only once in his life had as much wall-fruit as he wished. His consumption of tea was prodigious, beyond all precedent. Hawkins quotes Bishop Burnet as having drunk sixteen large cups every morning, a feat which would entitle him to be reckoned as a rival. \"A hardened and shameless tea-drinker,\" Johnson called himself, who \"with tea amuses the evenings, with tea solaces the midnights, and with tea welcomes the mornings.\" One of his teapots, preserved by a relic-hunter, contained two quarts, and he professed to have consumed five and twenty cups at a sitting. Poor Mrs. Thrale complains that he often kept her up making tea for him till four in the morning. His reluctance to go to bed was due to the fact that his nights were periods of intense misery; but the vast potations of tea can scarcely have tended to improve them. Boswell notes, with some surprise, that when Johnson dined with Lord Monboddo he insisted upon rising when the ladies left the table, and took occasion to observe that politeness was \"fictitious benevolence,\" and equally useful in common intercourse. Boswell\u0027s surprise seems to indicate that Scotchmen in those days were even greater bears than Johnson. He always insisted, as Miss Reynolds tells us, upon showing ladies to their carriages through Bolt Court, though his dress was such that her readers would, she thinks, be astonished that any man in his senses should have shown himself in it abroad or even at home. Another odd indication of Johnson\u0027s regard for good manners, so far as his lights would take him, was the extreme disgust with which he often referred to a certain footman in Paris, who used his fingers in place of sugar-tongs. So far as Johnson could recognize bad manners he was polite enough, though unluckily the limitation is one of considerable importance. Johnson\u0027s claims to politeness were sometimes, it is true, put in a rather startling form. \"Every man of any education,\" he once said to the amazement of his hearers, \"would rather be called a rascal than accused of deficiency in the graces.\" Gibbon, who was present, slily inquired of a lady whether among all her acquaintance she could not find one exception. According to Mrs. Thrale, he went even further. Dr. Barnard, he said, was the only man who had ever done justice to his good breeding; \"and you may observe,\" he added, \"that I am well-bred to a degree of needless scrupulosity.\" He proceeded, according to Mrs. Thrale, but the report a little taxes our faith, to claim the virtues not only of respecting ceremony, but of never contradicting or interrupting his hearers. It is rather odd that Dr. Barnard had once a sharp altercation with Johnson, Johnson, on this as on many occasions, repented of the blow as soon as it was struck, and sat down by Barnard, \"literally smoothing down his arms and knees,\" and beseeching pardon. Barnard accepted his apologies, but went home and wrote his little copy of verses. Johnson\u0027s shortcomings in civility were no doubt due, in part, to the narrowness of his faculties of perception. He did not know, for he could not see, that his uncouth gestures and slovenly dress were offensive; and he was not so well able to observe others as to shake off the manners contracted in Grub Street. It is hard to study a manual of etiquette late in life, and for a man of Johnson\u0027s imperfect faculties it was probably impossible. Errors of this kind were always pardonable, and are now simply ludicrous. But Johnson often shocked his companions by more indefensible conduct. He was irascible, overbearing, and, when angry, vehement beyond all propriety. He was a \"tremendous companion,\" said Garrick\u0027s brother; and men of gentle nature, like Charles Fox, often shrank from his company, and perhaps exaggerated his brutality. Johnson\u0027s retorts were fair play under the conditions of the game, as it is fair play to kick an opponent\u0027s shins at football. But of course a man who had, as it were, become the acknowledged champion of the ring, and who had an irascible and thoroughly dogmatic temper, was tempted to become unduly imperious. In the company of which Savage was a distinguished member, one may guess that the conversational fervour sometimes degenerated into horse-play. Want of arguments would be supplied by personality, and the champion would avenge himself by brutality on an opponent who happened for once to be getting the best of him. Johnson, as he grew older and got into more polished society, became milder in his manners; but he had enough of the old spirit left in him to break forth at times with ungovernable fury, and astonish the well-regulated minds of respectable ladies and gentlemen. Johnson paid frequent visits to Lichfield, to keep up his old friends. One of them was Lucy Porter, his wife\u0027s daughter, with whom, according to Miss Seward, he had been in love before he married her mother. He was at least tenderly attached to her through life. And, for the most part, the good people of Lichfield seem to have been proud of their fellow-townsman, and gave him a substantial proof of their sympathy by continuing to him, on favourable terms, the lease of a house originally granted to his father. There was, indeed, one remarkable exception in Miss Seward, who belonged to a genus specially contemptible to the old doctor. She was one of the fine ladies who dabbled in poetry, and aimed at being the centre of a small literary circle at Lichfield. Her letters are amongst the most amusing illustrations of the petty affectations and squabbles characteristic of such a provincial clique. She evidently hated Johnson at the bottom of her small soul; and, indeed, though Johnson once paid her a preposterous compliment—a weakness of which this stern moralist was apt to be guilty in the company of ladies—he no doubt trod pretty roughly upon some of her pet vanities. By far the most celebrated of Johnson\u0027s Lichfield friends was David Garrick, in regard to whom his relations were somewhat peculiar. Reynolds said that Johnson considered Garrick to be his own property, and would never allow him to be praised or blamed by any one else without contradiction. Reynolds composed a pair of imaginary dialogues to illustrate the proposition, in one of which Johnson attacks Garrick in answer to Reynolds, and in the other defends him in answer to Gibbon. The dialogues seem to be very good reproductions of the Johnsonian manner, though perhaps the courteous Reynolds was a little too much impressed by its roughness; and they probably include many genuine remarks of Johnson\u0027s. It is remarkable that the praise is far more pointed and elaborate than the blame, which turns chiefly upon the general inferiority of an actor\u0027s position. And, in fact, this seems to have corresponded to Johnson\u0027s opinion about Garrick as gathered from Boswell. The two men had at bottom a considerable regard for each other, founded upon old association, mutual services, and reciprocal respect for talents of very different orders. But they were so widely separated by circumstances, as well as by a radical opposition of temperament, that any close intimacy could hardly be expected. The bear and the monkey are not likely to be intimate friends. Garrick\u0027s rapid elevation in fame and fortune seems to have produced a certain degree of envy in his old schoolmaster. A grave moral philosopher has, of course, no right to look askance at the rewards which fashion lavishes upon men of lighter and less lasting merit, and which he professes to despise. Johnson, however, was troubled with a rather excessive allowance of human nature. Moreover he had the good old-fashioned contempt for players, characteristic both of the Tory and the inartistic mind. He asserted roundly that he looked upon players as no better than dancing-dogs. \"But, sir, you will allow that some players are better than others?\" \"Yes, sir, as some dogs dance better than others.\" So when Goldsmith accused Garrick of grossly flattering the queen, Johnson exclaimed, \"And as to meanness—how is it mean in a player, a showman, a fellow who exhibits himself for a shilling, to flatter his queen?\" At another time Boswell suggested that we might respect a great player. \"What! sir,\" exclaimed Johnson, \"a fellow who claps a hump upon his back and a lump on his leg and cries, \u0027I am Richard III.\u0027? Nay, sir, a ballad-singer is a higher man, for he does two things: he repeats and he sings; there is both recitation and music in his performance—the player only recites.\" Such sentiments were not very likely to remain unknown to Garrick nor to put him at ease with Johnson, whom, indeed, he always suspected of laughing at him. They had a little tiff on account of Johnson\u0027s Edition of Shakspeare. From some misunderstanding, Johnson did not make use of Garrick\u0027s collection of old plays. Johnson, it seems, thought that Gar-rick should have courted him more, and perhaps sent the plays to his house; whereas Garrick, knowing that Johnson treated books with a roughness ill-suited to their constitution, thought that he had done quite enough by asking Johnson to come to his library. The revenge—if it was revenge—taken by Johnson was to say nothing of Garrick in his Preface, and to glance obliquely at his non-communication of his rarities. He seems to have thought that it would be a lowering of Shakspeare to admit that his fame owed anything to Garrick\u0027s exertions. Nearly ten years afterwards, however, Johnson favoured his election, and when he died, declared that the Club should have a year\u0027s widowhood. No successor to Garrick was elected during that time. Johnson sometimes ventured to criticise Garrick\u0027s acting, but here Gar-rick could take his full revenge. The purblind Johnson was not, we may imagine, much of a critic in such matters. Garrick reports him to have said of an actor at Lichfield, \"There is a courtly vivacity about the fellow;\" when, in fact, said Garrick, \"he was the most vulgar ruffian that ever went upon boards.\" In spite of such collisions of opinion and mutual criticism, Johnson seems to have spoken in the highest terms of Garrick\u0027s good qualities, and they had many pleasant meetings. Garrick takes a prominent part in two or three of the best conversations in Boswell, and seems to have put his interlocutors in specially good temper. Johnson declared him to be \"the first man in the world for sprightly conversation.\" He said that Dry-den had written much better prologues than any of Garrick\u0027s, but that Garrick had written more good prologues than Dryden. He declared that it was wonderful how little Garrick had been spoilt by all the flattery that he had received. No wonder if he was a little vain: \"a man who is perpetually flattered in every mode that can be conceived: so many bellows have blown the fuel, that one wonders he is not by this time become a cinder!\" \"If all this had happened to me,\" he said on another occasion, \"I should have had a couple of fellows with long poles walking before me, to knock down everybody that stood in the way. Consider, if all this had happened to Cibber and Quin, they\u0027d have jumped over the moon. Yet Garrick speaks to us,\" smiling. He admitted at the same time that Garrick had raised the profession of a player. He defended Garrick, too, against the common charge of avarice. Garrick, as he pointed out, had been brought up in a family whose study it was to make fourpence go as far as fourpence-halfpenny. Johnson remembered in early days drinking tea with Garrick when Peg Woffington made it, and made it, as Garrick grumbled, \"as red as blood.\" But when Garrick became rich he became liberal. He had, so Johnson declared, given away more money than any man in England. After Garrick\u0027s death, Johnson took occasion to say, in the Lives of the Poets, that the death \"had eclipsed the gaiety of nations and diminished the public stock of harmless pleasures.\" Boswell ventured to criticise the observation rather spitefully. \"Why nations? Did his gaiety extend further than his own nation?\" \"Why, sir,\" replied Johnson, \"some imagination must be allowed. Besides, we may say nations if we allow the Scotch to be a nation, and to have gaiety—which they have not.\" On the whole, in spite of various drawbacks, Johnson\u0027s reported observations upon Garrick will appear to be discriminative, and yet, on the whole, strongly favourable to his character. Yet we are not quite surprised that Mrs. Gar-rick did not respond to a hint thrown out by Johnson, that he would be glad to write the life of his friend. At Oxford, Johnson acquired the friendship of Dr. Adams, afterwards Master of Pembroke and author of a once well-known reply to Hume\u0027s argument upon miracles. He was an amiable man, and was proud to do the honours of the university to his old friend, when, in later years, Johnson revisited the much-loved scenes of his neglected youth. The warmth of Johnson\u0027s regard for old days is oddly illustrated by an interview recorded by Boswell with one Edwards, a fellow-student whom he met again in 1778, not having previously seen him since 1729. They had lived in London for forty years without once meeting, a fact more surprising then than now. Boswell eagerly gathered up the little scraps of college anecdote which the meeting produced, but perhaps his best find was a phrase of Edwards himself. \"You are a philosopher, Dr. Johnson,\" he said; \"I have tried, too, in my time to be a philosopher; but, I don\u0027t know how, cheerfulness was always breaking in.\" The phrase, as Boswell truly says, records an exquisite trait of character. Among the other friends of this period must be reckoned his biographer, Hawkins, an attorney who was afterwards Chairman of the Middlesex Justices, and knighted on presenting an address to the King. Boswell regarded poor Sir John Hawkins with all the animosity of a rival author, and with some spice of wounded vanity. He was grievously offended, so at least says Sir John\u0027s daughter, on being described in the Life of Johnson as \"Mr. James Boswell\" without a solitary epithet such as celebrated or well-known. If that was really his feeling, he had his revenge; for no one book ever so suppressed another as Boswell\u0027s Life suppressed Hawkins\u0027s. In truth, Hawkins was a solemn prig, remarkable chiefly for the unusual intensity of his conviction that all virtue consists in respectability. He had a special aversion to \"goodness of heart,\" which he regarded as another name for a quality properly called extravagance or vice. Johnson\u0027s tenacity of old acquaintance introduced him into the Club, where he made himself so disagreeable, especially, as it seems, by rudeness to Burke, that he found it expedient to invent a pretext for resignation. Johnson called him a \"very unclubable man,\" and may perhaps have intended him in the quaint description: \"I really believe him to be an honest man at the bottom; though, to be sure, he is rather penurious, and he is somewhat mean; and it must be owned he has some degree of brutality, and is not without a tendency to savageness that cannot well be defended.\" In a list of Johnson\u0027s friends it is proper to mention Richardson and Hawkesworth. Richardson seems to have given him substantial help, and was repaid by favourable comparisons with Fielding, scarcely borne out by the verdict of posterity. \"Fielding,\" said Johnson, \"could tell the hour by looking at the clock; whilst Richardson knew how the clock was made.\" \"There is more knowledge of the heart,\" he said at another time, \"in one letter of Richardson\u0027s than in all Tom Jones.\" Johnson\u0027s preference of the sentimentalist to the man whose humour and strong sense were so like his own, shows how much his criticism was biassed by his prejudices; though, of course, Richardson\u0027s external decency was a recommendation to the moralist. Hawkesworth\u0027s intimacy with Johnson seems to have been chiefly in the period between the Dictionary and the pension. He was considered to be Johnson\u0027s best imitator; and has vanished like other imitators. His fate, very doubtful if the story believed at the time be true, was a curious one for a friend of Johnson\u0027s. He had made some sceptical remarks as to the efficacy of prayer in his preface to the South Sea Voyages; and was so bitterly attacked by a \"Christian\" in the papers, that he destroyed himself by a dose of opium. Early in their acquaintance, the two young men, Beau and Lanky, as Johnson called them, had sat up one night at a tavern till three in the morning. The courageous thought struck them that they would knock up the old philosopher. He came to the door of his chambers, poker in hand, with an old wig for a nightcap. On hearing their errand, the sage exclaimed, \"What! is it you, you dogs? I\u0027ll have a frisk with you.\" And so Johnson with the two youths, his juniors by about thirty years, proceeded to make a night of it. They amazed the fruiterers in Covent Garden; they brewed a bowl of bishop in a tavern, while Johnson quoted the poet\u0027s address to Sleep,— \"Short, O short, be then thy reign, And give us to the world again!\" They took a boat to Billingsgate, and Johnson, with Beauclerk, kept up their amusement for the following day, when Langton deserted them to go to breakfast with some young ladies, and Johnson scolded him for leaving his friends \"to go and sit with a parcel of wretched unidea\u0027d girls.\" \"I shall have my old friend to bail out of the round-house,\" said Garrick when he heard of this queer alliance; and he told Johnson that he would be in the Chronicle for his frolic. \"He durst not do such a thing. His wife would not let him,\" was the moralist\u0027s retort. Two friends, who deserve to be placed beside Reynolds, came from Ireland to seek their fortunes in London. Edmund Burke, incomparably the greatest writer upon political philosophy in English literature, the master of a style unrivalled for richness, flexibility, and vigour, was radically opposed to Johnson on party questions, though his language upon the French Revolution, after Johnson\u0027s death, would have satisfied even the strongest prejudices of his old friend. But he had qualities which commended him even to the man who called him a \"bottomless Whig,\" and who generally spoke of Whigs as rascals, and maintained that the first Whig was the devil. If his intellect was wider, his heart was as warm as Johnson\u0027s, and in conversation he merited the generous applause and warm emulation of his friends. Johnson was never tired of praising the extraordinary readiness and spontaneity of Burke\u0027s conversation. \"If a man,\" he said, \"went under a shed at the same time with Burke to avoid a shower, he would say, \u0027This is an extraordinary man.\u0027 Or if Burke went into a stable to see his horse dressed, the ostler would say, \u0027We have had an extraordinary man here.\u0027\" When Burke was first going into Parliament, Johnson said in answer to Hawkins, who wondered that such a man should get a seat, \"We who know Mr. Burke, know that he will be one of the first men in the country.\" Speaking of certain other members of Parliament, more after the heart of Sir John Hawkins, he said that he grudged success to a man who made a figure by a knowledge of a few forms, though his mind was \"as narrow as the neck of a vinegar cruet;\" but then he did not grudge Burke\u0027s being the first man in the House of Commons, for he would be the first man everywhere. And Burke equally admitted Johnson\u0027s supremacy in conversation. \"It is enough for me,\" he said to some one who regretted Johnson\u0027s monopoly of the talk on a particular occasion, \"to have rung the bell for him.\" The other Irish adventurer, whose career was more nearly moulded upon that of Johnson, came to London in 1756, and made Johnson\u0027s acquaintance. Some time afterwards (in or before 1761) Goldsmith, like Johnson, had tasted the bitterness of an usher\u0027s life, and escaped into the scarcely more tolerable regions of Grub Street. After some years of trial, he was becoming known to the booksellers as a serviceable hand, and had two works in his desk destined to lasting celebrity. His landlady (apparently 1764) one day arrested him for debt. Johnson, summoned to his assistance, sent him a guinea and speedily followed. The guinea had already been changed, and Goldsmith was consoling himself with a bottle of Madeira. Johnson corked the bottle, and a discussion of ways and means brought out the manuscript of the Vicar of Wakefield. Johnson looked into it, took it to a bookseller, got sixty pounds for it, and returned to Goldsmith, who paid his rent and administered a sound rating to his landlady. Boswell who attributes some of Goldsmith\u0027s sayings about Johnson to envy, said with probable truth that Goldsmith had not more envy than others, but only spoke of it more freely. Johnson argued that we must be angry with a man who had so much of an odious quality that he could not keep it to himself, but let it \"boil over.\" The feeling, at any rate, was momentary and totally free from malice; and Goldsmith\u0027s criticisms upon Johnson and his idolators seem to have been fair enough. His objection to Boswell\u0027s substituting a monarchy for a republic has already been mentioned. At another time he checked Boswell\u0027s flow of panegyric by asking, \"Is he like Burke, who winds into a subject like a serpent?\" To which Boswell replied with charming irrelevance, \"Johnson is the Hercules who strangled serpents in his cradle.\" The last of Goldsmith\u0027s hits was suggested by Johnson\u0027s shaking his sides with laughter because Goldsmith admired the skill with which the little fishes in the fable were made to talk in character. \"Why, Dr. Johnson, this is not so easy as you seem to think,\" was the retort, \"for if you were to make little fishes talk, they would talk like whales.\"","sourceLink":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/76/248.html","bookId":210,"book":{"id":210,"title":"Samuel Johnson塞缪尔·约翰逊","description":"简介： 塞缪尔·约翰逊(Samuel Johnson),英国作家,批评家。（1709—1784）英国文学史上重要的诗人、散文家、传记家和健谈家，编纂的《词典》对英语发展作出了重大贡献。和琼森一样，他也是当时文坛的...","cover":"https://cunovel.com/defaultCover.png","type":"Celebrity Biographies","link":"http://novel.tingroom.com/mingren/76","creation":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:24 AM","modification":"Aug 1, 2019 12:18:24 AM"}}
