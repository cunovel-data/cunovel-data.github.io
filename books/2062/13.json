{"id":110690,"no":13,"title":"Page 13","content":"Thirteen\\n\\n WHEN WE GOT BACK to our rooms, I made up an excuse to Lissa about how I needed to go take care of some guardian stuff. She was eager to patch up the earlier conflict with Christian - probably in the form of clothing removal - and didn\u0027t ask any questions. There was a phone in my room, and after calling an operator, I was able to find out which room was Dimitri\u0027s.\\n\\n He was surprised to see me at his door - and a little wary. The last time this had happened, I\u0027d been under the influence of Victor\u0027s lust charm and had behaved ... aggressively.\\n\\n \"I have to talk to you,\" I said.\\n\\n He let me come in, and I immediately handed over the note.\\n\\n \"V. D - \"\\n\\n \"Yeah, I know,\" said Dimitri. He handed the note back. \"Victor Dashkov.\"\\n\\n \"What are we going to do? I mean, we talked about this, but now he really is saying he\u0027s going to sell us out.\"\\n\\n Dimitri didn\u0027t answer, and I could tell he was assessing every angle of this, just like he would a fight. Finally, he pulled out his cell phone, which was a lot cooler than having to rely on the room\u0027s phone. \"Give me a moment.\"\\n\\n I started to sit on his bed, decided that was dangerous, and instead sat on the couch. I didn\u0027t know who he was calling, but the conversation took place in Russian.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s going on?\" I asked when he finished.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll let you know soon. For now, we have to wait.\"\\n\\n \"Great. My favorite thing to do.\"\\n\\n He dragged an armchair up and sat opposite me. It seemed too small for someone as tall as him, but, as always, he managed to make it work and appear graceful in the process.\\n\\n Beside me was one of the Western novels he always carried around. I picked it up, again thinking about how alone he was. Even now, at the Court, he\u0027d chosen to stay in his room. \"Why do you read these?\"\\n\\n \"Some people read books for fun,\" he observed.\\n\\n \"Hey, watch the dig. And I do read books. I read them to solve mysteries that threaten my best friend\u0027s life and sanity. I don\u0027t think reading this cowboy stuff is really saving the world like I do.\"\\n\\n He took it from me and flipped it over, face thoughtful and not as intense as usual. \"Like any book, it\u0027s an escape. And there\u0027s something ... mmm. I don\u0027t know. Something appealing about the Old West. No rules. Everyone just lives by their own code. You don\u0027t have to be tied down by others\u0027 ideas of right and wrong in order to bring justice.\"\\n\\n \"Wait,\" I laughed. \"I thought I was the one who wanted to break rules.\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t say I wanted to. Just that I can see the appeal.\"\\n\\n \"You can\u0027t fool me, comrade. You want to put on a cowboy hat and keep lawless bank robbers in line.\"\\n\\n \"No time. I have enough trouble keeping you in line.\"\\n\\n I grinned, and suddenly, it was a lot like when we cleaned the church - before the fight, at least. Easy. Comfortable. In fact, it was a lot like the old days when we\u0027d first begun training together, way back before everything had gotten so complicated. Well, okay...things had always been complicated, but for a while, they\u0027d been less complicated. It made me sad. I wished we could relive those early days. There\u0027d been no Victor Dashkov, no blood on my hands.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" Dimitri said all of a sudden.\\n\\n \"For what? Reading cheesy novels?\"\\n\\n \"For not being able to get you here. I feel like I let you down.\" I glimpsed a shadow of worry on his face, like he was concerned he might have caused some irreparable damage.\\n\\n The apology totally caught me off guard. For a moment, I wondered if he was jealous of Adrian\u0027s influence in the same way Christian had been. Then I realized it was completely different. I\u0027d been giving Dimitri a hard time because I\u0027d been convinced he could do anything. Somewhere - deep inside - he felt the same, at least where I was concerned. He didn\u0027t want to deny me anything. My earlier bad mood had long since vanished, and I suddenly just felt drained. And stupid.\\n\\n \"You didn\u0027t,\" I told him. \"I acted like a total brat. You\u0027ve never let me down before. You didn\u0027t let me down with this.\"\\n\\n The grateful look he gave me made me feel as if I had wings. If another moment had passed, I suspected he would have said something so sweet that I would have flown away. Instead, his phone rang.\\n\\n Another conversation in Russian took place, and then he stood up. \"All right, let\u0027s go.\"\\n\\n \"Where?\"\\n\\n \"To see Victor Dashkov.\"\\n\\n It turned out that Dimitri had a friend who had a friend, and somehow, despite the best security in the Moroi world, we managed to get into the Court\u0027s prison facilities.\\n\\n \"Why are we doing this?\" I whispered as we walked down the hall toward Victor\u0027s cell. I\u0027d really, really hoped for stone walls and torches, but the place looked very modern and efficient, with marble floors and stark white walls. At least there were no windows. \"You think we can talk him out of it?\"\\n\\n Dimitri shook his head. \"If Victor wanted to take revenge on us, he\u0027d just do it without any warning. He doesn\u0027t do things without a reason. The fact that he told you first means he wants something, and now we\u0027re going to find out what it is.\"\\n\\n We reached Victor\u0027s cell. He was the only prisoner currently being held. Like the rest of the facility, his room reminded me of something you\u0027d find at a hospital. Everything was clean, bright, and sterile - and very bare. It was a place without any sort of stimulus or distraction whatsoever, which would have driven me crazy in one hour. The cell had silvery bars that looked very hard to break, which was the most important part.\\n\\n Victor sat in a chair, idly examining his nails. It had been three months since our last meeting, and seeing him again made my skin crawl. Feelings I hadn\u0027t known were buried in me suddenly burst to the surface.\\n\\n One of the hardest things of all was seeing him look so healthy and young. He\u0027d bought that health by torturing Lissa, and I hated him for it. If his disease had run its normal course, he might be dead by now.\\n\\n He had receding black hair, with only the slightest touch of silver. He was in his forties and had a regal, almost handsome cut to his face. He glanced up at our approach. Eyes the same pale jade as Lissa\u0027s met mine. The Dragomir and Dashkov families had a lot of intertwined history, and it was creepy seeing that eye color in someone else. A smile lit his face.\\n\\n \"Oh my. This is a treat. Lovely Rosemarie, practically an adult now.\" His eyes flicked toward Dimitri. \"Of course, some have been treating you that way for quite a while.\"\\n\\n I pressed my face to the bars. \"Stop screwing with us, you son of a bitch. What do you want?\"\\n\\n Dimitri put a gentle hand on my shoulder and pulled me back. \"Easy, Rose.\"\\n\\n I took a deep breath and then slowly stepped backward. Victor straightened up in his chair and laughed.\\n\\n \"After all this time, your cub still hasn\u0027t learned any control. But then, maybe you never really wanted her to.\"\\n\\n \"We aren\u0027t here to banter,\" said Dimitri calmly. \"You wanted to lure Rose over, and now we need to know why.\"\\n\\n \"Does there have to be some sinister reason? I just wanted to know how she was doing, and something tells me we aren\u0027t going to have a chance for any friendly chats tomorrow.\" That annoying smirk stayed on his face, and I decided then that he was lucky to be behind bars and out of my reach.\\n\\n \"We\u0027re not going to have a friendly chat now,\" I growled.\\n\\n \"You think I\u0027m joking, but I\u0027m not. I really do want to know how you\u0027re doing. You\u0027ve always been a fascinating subject to me, Rosemarie. The only shadow-kissed person we know of. I told you before, that isn\u0027t the kind of thing you walk away from unscathed. There\u0027s no way you can quietly sink into the regimented routine of academic life. People like you aren\u0027t meant to blend in.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not some kind of science experiment.\"\\n\\n He acted like I hadn\u0027t said anything. \"What\u0027s it been like? What have you noticed?\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s no time for this. If you don\u0027t get to the point,\" warned Dimitri, \"we\u0027re going to leave.\"\\n\\n I didn\u0027t understand how Dimitri could sound so calm. I leaned forward and gave Victor my coldest smile. \"There\u0027s no way they\u0027ll let you off tomorrow. I hope you enjoy prison. I bet it\u0027ll be great once you get sick again - and you will, you know.\"\\n\\n Victor regarded me levelly, still with that amused look that made me want to choke him. \"All things die, Rose. Well, except for you, I suppose. Or maybe you are dead. I don\u0027t know. Those who visit the world of the dead can probably never fully shake their connection to it.\"\\n\\n There was a snarky retort on my lips, but something held me back. Those who visit the world of the dead. What if my Mason sightings weren\u0027t because I was crazy or because he was seeking revenge? What if there was something about me - something that had happened when I\u0027d died and come back - that was now connecting me to Mason? It was Victor who had first explained what it meant to be shadow-kissed. I wondered now if he had any of the answers I\u0027d been looking for.\\n\\n My face must have given away something, because Victor gave me a speculative look. \"Yes? There\u0027s something you\u0027d like to say?\"\\n\\n I hated to ask him for anything. It made my stomach turn. Swallowing my pride, I asked, \"What is the world of the dead? Is it heaven or hell?\"\\n\\n \"Neither,\" he said.\\n\\n \"What lives there?\" I exclaimed. \"Ghosts? Will I go back? Do things come out of it?\"\\n\\n Victor was taking great pleasure in me having to come to him for information, just as I\u0027d feared he would. I saw that smirk intensify.\\n\\n \"Well, clearly some things come out of it, because here you stand before us.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s baiting you,\" said Dimitri. \"Let it go.\"\\n\\n Victor gave Dimitri a brief glare. \"I\u0027m helping her.\" He turned back to me. \"Honestly? I don\u0027t know that much about it. You\u0027re the one who has been there, Rose. Not me. Not yet. Someday, you\u0027ll probably be the one educating me. I\u0027m sure the more you deal death out, the closer you\u0027ll become to it.\"\\n\\n \"Enough,\" said Dimitri, voice harsh. \"We\u0027re going.\"\\n\\n \"Wait, wait,\" said Victor, voice congenial. \"You haven\u0027t told me about Vasilisa yet.\"\\n\\n I moved forward again. \"Stay away from her. She doesn\u0027t have anything to do with this.\"\\n\\n Victor gave me a dry look. \"Seeing as I\u0027m locked away here, I have no choice but to stay away from her, my dear. And you\u0027re wrong - Vasilisa has everything to do with everything.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s it,\" I said, suddenly getting it. \"That\u0027s why you sent the note. You wanted me here because you wanted to know about her, and you knew there was no way she\u0027d come talk to you herself. You had nothing to blackmail her with.\"\\n\\n \"Blackmail\u0027s an ugly word.\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s no way you\u0027re going to see her - at least outside of the courtroom. She\u0027s never going to heal you. I told you: You\u0027re going to get sick again, and you\u0027re going to die. You\u0027re going to be the one sending me postcards from the other side.\"\\n\\n \"You think that\u0027s what this is about? You think my needs are that petty?\" The mockery was gone, replaced by a feverish and almost fanatical look in his green eyes. The tight set of his mouth stretched the skin of his face a little, and I noticed he\u0027d lost weight since our last encounter. Maybe prison had been harder on him than I\u0027d thought. \"You\u0027ve forgotten everything, why I did what I did. You\u0027ve been so caught up in your own shortsightedness that you missed the big picture I was looking at.\"\\n\\n I racked my brain, thinking back to that time last fall. He was right. My focus had been on the wrongs he\u0027d committed against Lissa and me personally. I\u0027d forgotten other conversations, his insane explanations of his grand scheme.\\n\\n \"You wanted to stage a revolution - still want to. That\u0027s crazy. It\u0027s not going to happen,\" I said.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s already happening. Do you think I don\u0027t know what\u0027s going on out in the world? I still have contacts. People can be bought off - how do you think I was able to send you that message? I know about the unrest - I know about Natasha Ozera\u0027s movement to get Moroi to fight with guardians. You stand by her and vilify me, Rosemarie, but I pushed for the very same thing last fall. Yet, somehow, you don\u0027t seem to regard her in the same way.\"\\n\\n \"Tasha Ozera is working on her cause a bit differently than you did,\" noted Dimitri.\\n\\n \"And that\u0027s why she\u0027s getting nowhere,\" Victor retorted. \"Tatiana and her council are being held back by centuries of archaic traditions. So long as that sort of power rules us, nothing will change. We will never learn to fight. Non-royal Moroi will never have a voice. Dhampirs like you will continually be sent out to battle.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s what we dedicate our lives to,\" said Dimitri. I could sense the tension building in him. He might show better self-control than me, but I knew he was getting just as frustrated here.\\n\\n \"And it\u0027s what you lose your lives for. You\u0027re all but enslaved and don\u0027t even realize it. And for what? Why do you protect us?\"\\n\\n \"Because ... we need you,\" I faltered. \"For our race to survive.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t need to throw yourselves into battle for that. Making children isn\u0027t really that difficult.\"\\n\\n I ignored his quip. \"And because the Moroi... the Moroi and their magic are important. They can do amazing things.\"\\n\\n Victor threw his hands up in exasperation. \"We used to do amazing things. Humans used to revere us as gods, but over time, we grew lazy. The advent of technology made our magic more and more obsolete. Now, all we do is parlor tricks.\"\\n\\n \"If you have so many ideas,\" said Dimitri, with a dangerous glint in his dark eyes, \"then do something useful in prison and write a manifesto.\"\\n\\n \"And what\u0027s this have to do with Lissa anyway?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"Because Vasilisa is a vehicle for change.\"\\n\\n I stared incredulously. \"You think she\u0027s going to lead your revolution?\"\\n\\n \"Well, I\u0027d prefer that I lead it - someday. But, regardless, I think that she\u0027s going to be part of it. I\u0027ve heard about her too. She\u0027s a rising star - still young, certainly, but people are taking notice. All royals aren\u0027t created equal, you know. The Dragomir symbol is a dragon, the king of the beasts. Likewise, the Dragomir blood has always been powerful - that\u0027s why the Strigoi have targeted them so consistently. A Dragomir returning to power is no small thing - particularly one such as her. My impression from the reports is that she must have mastered her magic. If that\u0027s so - with her gifts - there\u0027s no telling what she could do. People are drawn to her with almost no effort on her part. And when she actually tries to influence them...well, they\u0027ll do anything she wants.\" His eyes were wide as he spoke, wonder and happiness on his face as he imagined Lissa living out his dreams.\\n\\n \"Unbelievable,\" I said. \"First you wanted to hide her away to keep you alive. Now you actually want her out in the world to use her compulsion for your own psycho plans.\"\\n\\n \"I told you, she\u0027s a force for change. And like you being shadow-kissed, she\u0027s the only one of her kind that we know about. That makes her dangerous - and very valuable.\"\\n\\n Well, that was something. Victor wasn\u0027t all-knowing after all. He didn\u0027t know about Adrian\u0027s spirit use.\\n\\n \"Lissa will never do it,\" I said. \"She\u0027s not going to abuse her powers.\"\\n\\n \"And Victor\u0027s not going to say anything about us,\" said Dimitri, tugging my arm. \"He\u0027s achieved his goal. He brought you here because he wanted to know about Lissa.\"\\n\\n \"He didn\u0027t find out much,\" I said.\\n\\n \"You\u0027d be surprised,\" said Victor. He grinned at Dimitri. \"And what makes you so certain I won\u0027t enlighten the world about your romantic indiscretions?\"\\n\\n \"Because it won\u0027t save you from prison. And if you ruin Rose, you\u0027ll destroy whatever weak chance you had of Lissa helping you with your warped fantasy.\" Victor flinched just a little; Dimitri was right. Dimitri stepped forward, pressing close to the bars as I had earlier. I\u0027d thought I had a scary voice, but when he spoke his next words, I realized I wasn\u0027t even close. \"And it\u0027ll all be pointless anyway, because you won\u0027t stay alive long enough in prison to stage your grand plans. You aren\u0027t the only one with connections.\"\\n\\n My breath caught a little. Dimitri brought so many things to my life: love, comfort, and instruction. I got so used to him sometimes that I forgot just how dangerous he could be. As he stood there, tall and threatening while he glared down at Victor, I felt a chill run down my spine. I remembered how when I had first come to the Academy, people had said Dimitri was a god. In this moment, he looked it.\\n\\n If Victor was frightened by Dimitri\u0027s threat, he didn\u0027t show it. His jade green eyes glanced between the two of us. \"You two are a match made in heaven. Or somewhere.\"\\n\\n \"See you in court,\" I said.\\n\\n Dimitri and I left. On our way out, he said a few words in Russian to the guardian on duty. From their manners, my guess was Dimitri was offering thanks.\\n\\n We ventured outdoors, walking across a wide, beautiful parklike space to get back to our rooms. The sleet had stopped, and it had left everything - buildings and trees alike - coated in ice. It was like the world was made of glass. Glancing at Dimitri, I saw him staring straight ahead. It was hard to tell while walking, but I could have sworn he was shaking.\\n\\n \"Are you okay?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"You sure?\"\\n\\n \"As okay as I can be.\"\\n\\n \"Do you think he\u0027ll tell everyone about us?\"\\n\\n \"No.\"\\n\\n We walked in silence for a bit. I finally asked the question I\u0027d been dying to know.\\n\\n \"Did you mean it... that if Victor did tell...that you\u0027d...\" I couldn\u0027t finish. I couldn\u0027t bring myself to say the words have him killed.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t have much influence in the upper levels of Moroi royalty, but I have plenty among the guardians who handle the dirty work in our world.\"\\n\\n \"You didn\u0027t answer the question. If you\u0027d really do it.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027d do a lot of things to protect you, Roza.\"\\n\\n My heart pounded. He only used \"Roza\" when he was feeling particularly affectionate toward me.\\n\\n \"It wouldn\u0027t exactly be protecting me. It\u0027d be after the fact - cold-blooded. You don\u0027t do that kind of thing,\" I told him. \"Revenge is more my thing. I\u0027ll have to kill him.\"\\n\\n I meant it as a joke, but he didn\u0027t think it was funny. \"Don\u0027t talk like that. And anyway, it doesn\u0027t matter. Victor\u0027s not going to say anything.\"\\n\\n He left me to go to his own room when we got inside. As I was opening the door to mine, Lissa rounded the hall corner.\\n\\n \"There you are. What happened? You missed dinner.\"\\n\\n I\u0027d completely forgotten. \"Sorry ... got carried away with some guardian stuff. It\u0027s a long story.\"\\n\\n She\u0027d changed for dinner. Her hair was still pulled up, and she now wore a form-fitting dress made out of silver raw silk. She looked beautiful. She looked royal. I thought about Victor\u0027s words and wondered if she really could be the power for change he swore she was. Looking like she did now, so glamorous and self-composed, I could imagine people following her anywhere. I certainly would, but then, I was biased.\\n\\n \"Why are you looking at me like that?\" she asked with a small smile.\\n\\n I couldn\u0027t tell her that I\u0027d just seen the man who frightened her the most. I couldn\u0027t tell her that while she\u0027d been out living it up, I\u0027d been off watching her back in the shadows, like I would always do.\\n\\n Instead, I returned her smile. \"I like the dress.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/shadow-kiss-vampire-academy-3/page-13.html","bookId":2062,"book":{"id":2062,"title":"Shadow Kiss (Vampire Academy #3)","description":"Storyline: Vampire Academy Series 3: Shadow Kiss \\n A little background...

I picked up the twilight series a year ago at a students request and was pleasantly surprised. Once the series was finished I needed another one! Before Twilight I had not been into teen romance/ fantasy books especially with vampires and such. I saw a book-list of recommendations by Twilight followers and picked up the \"House of Night\" series by PC Cast. This was worth reading and I am waiting for the next book to come.
