{"id":110698,"no":21,"title":"Page 21","content":"Twenty-one\n I COULD HARDLY WAIT for my day to end. I\u0027d promised Lissa I\u0027d hang out with her and the others after school. It should have been fun, but the minutes dragged by. I was too restless. When curfew came around, I split off from them ran back to my dorm. I asked the woman at the front desk if she could call up to Dimitri\u0027s room - off-limits to students - because I had an \"urgent\" question for him. She had just picked up the phone when Celeste walked past.\n \"He\u0027s not there,\" she told me. She had a large bruise on the side of her face. Some novice had gotten the better of her - some novice who wasn\u0027t me. \"I think he was going to the chapel. You\u0027ll have to see him tomorrow - you can\u0027t be there and back before curfew comes.\"\n I nodded meekly and acted like I was heading for the student wing. Instead, as soon as she was out of sight, I headed back outside again and ran to the chapel. She was right. I wasn\u0027t going to make curfew, but hopefully Dimitri could make sure I got back without getting in trouble.\n The chapel\u0027s doors were unlocked when I reached them. I walked in and saw all the candles lit, making all the gold ornaments in the room sparkle. The priest must still be working. But, when I stepped inside the sanctuary, he wasn\u0027t there. Dimitri was, however.\n He sat in the last pew. He wasn\u0027t praying or kneeling or anything. He just sat there, looking quite relaxed. Although he wasn\u0027t a practicing member of the church, he\u0027d told me he often found peace there. It gave him a chance to think about his life and the deeds he\u0027d done.\n I always thought he looked good, but just then, something about him nearly made me come to a standstill. Maybe it was because of the background, all the polished wood and colorful icons of saints. Maybe it was just the way the candlelight shone on his dark hair. Maybe it was just because he looked unguarded, almost vulnerable. He was normally so wound up, so on edge ... but even he needed the occasional moment of rest. He seemed to glow in my eyes, kind of in the way Lissa always did. His normal tension returned when he heard me come in.\n \"Rose, is everything okay?\" He started to stand, and I motioned him down as I slid into the spot beside him. The faint smell of incense lingered in the air.\n \"Yeah ... well, kind of. No breakdowns, if that\u0027s what you\u0027re worried about. I just had a question. Or, well, a theory.\"\n I explained the conversation with Alice and what I\u0027d deduced from it. He listened patiently, expression thoughtful.\n \"I know Alice. I\u0027m not sure she\u0027s credible,\" he said when I finished. It was similar to what he\u0027d said about Victor.\n \"I know. I thought the same thing. But a lot of it makes sense.\"\n \"Not quite. As you pointed out, why are your visions so irregular here? That doesn\u0027t go along with the ward theory. You should feel like you did on the plane.\"\n \"What if the wards are just weak?\" I asked.\n He shook his head. \"That\u0027s impossible. Wards take months to wear down. New ones are put in place here every two weeks.\"\n \"That often?\" I asked, unable to hide my disappointment. I\u0027d known maintenance was frequent but not that frequent. Alice\u0027s theory had almost provided a sound explanation, one that didn\u0027t involve me being insane.\n \"Maybe they\u0027re getting staked,\" I suggested. \"By humans or something - like we saw before.\"\n \"Guardians walk the grounds a few times a day. If there was a stake in the borders of campus, we\u0027d notice.\"\n I sighed.\n Dimitri moved his hand over mine, and I flinched. He didn\u0027t remove it, though, and as he did so frequently, guessed my thoughts. \"You thought if she was right, it would explain everything.\"\n I nodded. \"I don\u0027t want to be crazy.\"\n \"You aren\u0027t crazy.\"\n \"But you don\u0027t believe I\u0027m really seeing ghosts.\"\n He glanced away, his eyes staring at the flickering of candles on the altar. \"I don\u0027t know. I\u0027m still trying to keep an open mind. And being stressed isn\u0027t the same as being crazy.\"\n \"I know,\" I admitted, still very conscious of how warm his hand was. I shouldn\u0027t have been thinking about things like that in a church. \"But... well... there\u0027s something else....\"\n I told him then about Anna possibly \"catching\" Vladimir\u0027s insanity. I also explained Adrian\u0027s aura observations. He turned his gaze back on me, expression speculative.\n \"Have you told anyone else about this? Lissa? Your counselor?\"\n \"No,\" I said in a small voice, unable to meet his eyes. \"I was afraid of what they\u0027d think.\"\n He squeezed my hand. \"You have to stop this. You aren\u0027t afraid of throwing yourself in the path of danger, but you\u0027re terrified of letting anyone in.\"\n \"I... I don\u0027t know,\" I said, looking up at him. \"I guess.\"\n \"Then why\u0027d you tell me?\"\n I smiled. \"Because you told me I should trust people. I trust you.\"\n \"You don\u0027t trust Lissa?\"\n My smile faltered. \"I trust her, absolutely. But I don\u0027t want to tell her things that\u0027ll make her worry. I guess it\u0027s a way of protecting her, just like keeping Strigoi away.\"\n \"She\u0027s stronger than you think,\" he said. \"And she would go out of her way to help you.\"\n \"So what? You want me to confide in her and not you?\"\n \"No, I want you to confide in both of us. I think it\u0027d be good for you. Does what happened to Anna bother you?\"\n \"No.\" I looked away again. \"It scares me.\"\n I think the admission stunned both of us. I certainly hadn\u0027t expected to say it. We both froze for a moment, and then Dimitri wrapped his arms around me and pulled me to his chest. A sob built up in me as I rested my cheek against the leather of his coat and heard the steady beating of his heart.\n \"I don\u0027t want to be like that,\" I told him. \"I want to be like everyone else. I want my mind to be ... normal. Normal by Rose standards, I mean. I don\u0027t want to lose control. I don\u0027t want to be like Anna and kill myself. I love being alive. I\u0027d die to save my friends, but I hope it doesn\u0027t happen. I hope we all live long, happy lives. Like Lissa said - one big happy family. There\u0027s so much I want to do, but I\u0027m so scared ... scared that I\u0027ll be like her.... I\u0027m afraid I won\u0027t be able to stop it...\"\n He held me tighter. \"It\u0027s not going to happen,\" he murmured. \"You\u0027re wild and impulsive, but at the end of the day, you\u0027re one of the strongest people I know. Even if you are the same as Anna - and I don\u0027t think you are - you two won\u0027t share the same fate.\"\n It was funny. I\u0027d often told Lissa the same thing about her and Vladimir. She\u0027d always had a hard time believing it, and now I understood. Giving advice was a lot harder than following it.\n \"You\u0027re also missing something,\" he continued, running a hand over my hair. \"If you are in danger from Lissa\u0027s magic, then at least you understand why. She can stop using her magic, and that\u0027ll be the end of it.\"\n I pulled away slightly so I could look at him. Hastily, I ran my hand over my eyes in case any tears had escaped.\n \"But can I ask her to do that?\" I said. \"I\u0027ve felt how it makes her feel. I don\u0027t know if I can take that away from her.\"\n He regarded me with surprise. \"Even at the cost of your own life?\"\n \"Vladimir did great things - so could she. Besides, they come first, right?\"\n \"Not always.\"\n I stared. I\u0027d had they come first drilled into me since I was a child. It was what all guardians believed. Only the dhampirs who\u0027d run away from their duty didn\u0027t subscribe to that. What he said was almost like treason.\n \"Sometimes, Rose, you have to know when to put yourself first.\"\n I shook my head. \"Not with Lissa.\" I might as well have been with Deirdre or Ambrose again. Why was everyone suddenly challenging something that I\u0027d held as absolute truth my entire life?\n \"She\u0027s your friend. She\u0027ll understand.\" To make his point, he reached forward and tugged at the chotki peeking out underneath my sleeve, his fingertips brushing my wrist.\n \"It\u0027s more than that,\" I said. I pointed to the cross. \"If anything, this proves it. I\u0027m bound to her, to protect the Dragomirs, at all costs.\"\n \"I know, but ...\" He didn\u0027t finish, and honestly, what could he have said? This was becoming an old argument, one without a solution.\n \"I need to get back,\" I said abruptly. \"It\u0027s past curfew.\"\n A wry smile crossed Dimitri\u0027s face. \"And you need me to get you back or you\u0027ll get in trouble.\"\n \"Well, yeah, I was kind of hoping....\"\n We heard some rustling near the door of the sanctuary, and Father Andrew walked in, which definitely ended our session. He was getting ready to shut down the chapel. Dimitri thanked him, and then the two of us headed back to the dhampir dorm. Neither of us spoke along the way, but it was a comfortable silence. It was weird, but since his outburst outside the med clinic, I felt like something had intensified between us, as impossible as that seemed.\n Dimitri got me past the woman at the front desk, and just as I was about to head off for my wing, a guardian named Yuri walked by. Dimitri called to him.\n \"You\u0027ve been working with security, haven\u0027t you? When was the last time they laid new wards?\"\n Yuri considered. \"A couple days ago. Why?\"\n Dimitri gave me a meaningful look. \"Just curious.\"\n I nodded to Dimitri to show that I understood his point, and then I went off to bed.\n After that, the next week or so played out in a repetitive pattern. I followed Christian for three days a week, had my counseling sessions, and trained with Dimitri. During those times, I could see the concern on Dimitri\u0027s face. He always asked how I was but didn\u0027t push me to talk about anything I didn\u0027t want to. Mostly, it was all physical training, which I liked since it didn\u0027t require too much ruminating.\n Best of all, I didn\u0027t see Mason during this time.\n I also didn\u0027t witness any attacks - of either the Man? type or the guardian type.\n We were in full throes of the field experience, and every other novice in my class was having regular fights. The tests grew intricate and more difficult, and everyone had to stay on their toes. Eddie seemed to have to defend Lissa every other day from some guardian playing Strigoi - but it never happened when I was around. In fact, no attacks at all happened to anyone when I was around. After a while, I began to get the idea. They were going soft on me. They were worried I couldn\u0027t handle it.\n \"They might as well have cut me from the field experience after all,\" I grumbled to Christian one evening. \"I\u0027m not doing anything.\"\n \"Yeah, but if you still pass, why worry about it? I mean, do you actually want to get in a fight every day?\" He then rolled his eyes. \"Never mind. Of course you do.\"\n \"You don\u0027t understand,\" I told him. \"This job isn\u0027t about taking the easy way out. I want to prove what I can do - to them and to myself. You can never get enough practice. I mean, Lissa\u0027s life is at stake.\" And also possibly my future with her. I\u0027d worried before that they might decide to replace me - and that was before they thought I was nuts.\n It was nearly curfew time, and I was dropping him off for the night. He shook his head. \"Rose, I don\u0027t know if you\u0027re crazy or not, but I\u0027m actually starting to think you might be the best guardian - or soon-to-be guardian - out there.\"\n \"Did you just give me a serious compliment?\" I asked.\n He turned his back on me and headed inside his dorm. \"Good night.\"\n My life was still in chaos, but I couldn\u0027t help a small grin as I headed back toward my dorm. The walk always made me nervous since I now lived in perpetual fear of seeing Mason. There were other people scurrying back before curfew too, though, and he mostly tended to show up when I was alone, either because he preferred the privacy or because he really was a figment of my imagination.\n Talking about Lissa reminded me that I\u0027d hardly seen her today. Comfortable and content, I let my mind slip into hers while my body continued its walk.\n She was in the library, hurriedly trying to finish up some notes. Eddie stood near her, glancing around. \"Better hurry up,\" he said teasingly. \"She\u0027s making another round.\"\n \"Almost done,\" Lissa said, scrawling a few more words.\n She shut the textbook just as the librarian came by and told them they had to leave now. With a sigh of relief, Lissa stuffed her papers into her bag and followed Eddie out. He picked it up and carried it over his shoulder as they went.\n \"You don\u0027t have to do that,\" she said. \"You aren\u0027t my valet.\"\n \"You can have it back as soon as you fix that.\" He gestured to where she was tangled up in her coat. She\u0027d shoved it on while trying to get out of the library on time. She laughed at her own disorderliness and adjusted the inside-out sleeve.\n \"Thanks,\" she said when he handed it back.\n \"No problem.\"\n Lissa liked Eddie - though not in a romantic kind of way. She just thought he was nice. He did things like that all the time, helping her out while still doing an excellent job in his duties. His motives weren\u0027t romantic, either. He was just one of those rare guys who could be both a gentleman and a badass. She had plans for him.\n \"Have you ever thought about asking Rose out?\"\n \"What?\" he asked.\n What? I thought.\n \"You guys just have so much in common,\" she said, trying to sound casual. Inside, she was excited. She thought this was the best idea in the world. For me, it was one of those moments where being in her mind was being too close to her. I would rather have been standing beside her so I could shake some sense into her.\n \"She\u0027s just my friend,\" he laughed, his face taking on kind of a cute shyness. \"And I don\u0027t think we\u0027d actually be that compatible. Besides ...\" His expression fell. \"I could never go out with Mason\u0027s girlfriend.\"\n Lissa started to say what I always told her, that I hadn\u0027t actually been Mason\u0027s girlfriend. Wisely, she instead chose to let Eddie keep believing the best. \"Everyone has to move on sometime.\"\n \"It hasn\u0027t been that long, not really. Just over a month. And it\u0027s not really something you get over quickly.\" His eyes had a sad, faraway look that hurt both Lissa and me.\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" she said. \"I didn\u0027t mean to make it sound like something small. What you saw - I know it was horrible.\"\n \"You know what\u0027s weird? I actually don\u0027t remember much of it. And that\u0027s what\u0027s horrible. I was so drugged out that I had no idea what was going on. I hate that - you have no idea. Being helpless like that... it\u0027s the worst thing in the world.\"\n I felt the same way. I think it was a guardian thing. Eddie and I had never talked about it, though. We\u0027d never even talked about Spokane much.\n \"It wasn\u0027t your fault,\" Lissa told him. \"Strigoi endorphins are strong. You couldn\u0027t have fought against them.\"\n \"I should have tried harder,\" he countered, holding the door to her dorm open. \"If I\u0027d been even a little more conscious ... I don\u0027t know. Mason might still be alive.\"\n Eddie and I, I realized, should both have been in therapy as soon as we got back from winter break. I finally understood why everyone said blaming myself for Mason\u0027s death was irrational. Eddie and I were both holding ourselves responsible for things that had been beyond our control. We were torturing ourselves with guilt we didn\u0027t deserve.\n \"Hey, Lissa. Come here.\"\n The serious subject was put on hold as Jesse and Ralf waved at her from across the dorm\u0027s lobby. My defenses immediately went up. So did hers. She didn\u0027t like them any better than I did.\n \"What\u0027s this about?\" asked Eddie warily.\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" she muttered, walking over. \"I hope it\u0027s fast.\"\n Jesse gave her a dazzling smile, one that I had once found really hot. Now I saw it for the fake piece of crap it was. \"How\u0027s it going?\" he asked.\n \"It\u0027s going tired,\" she replied. \"I need to get to bed. What\u0027s up?\"\n Jesse looked over at Eddie. \"Would you give us a little privacy?\" Eddie looked at Lissa. She nodded, and Eddie backed up enough to be out of earshot but still watch her. When he was gone, Jesse said, \"We have an invitation for you.\"\n \"To what, a party?\"\n \"Kind of. It\u0027s a group ...\" Ralf wasn\u0027t so good with words, and Jesse took over again.\n \"More than a group. It\u0027s only for elite people.\" He gestured around. \"You and me and Ralf... we\u0027re not like a lot of other Moroi. We\u0027re not even like a lot of other royals. We have concerns and issues that we need to take care of.\" I thought it was funny that he\u0027d include Ralf. Ralf\u0027s royalty came from his mother, a Voda, so he didn\u0027t even carry one of the royal names, even if he technically had the blood.\n \"It sounds kind of ... snobby,\" she said. \"No offense. Thanks for the offer, though.\" That was Lissa. Always polite, even to creeps like these.\n \"You don\u0027t understand. We aren\u0027t just sitting around. We\u0027re working to get things done. We\u0027re - \" he hesitated and then spoke more softly, \" - working on ways to get our voices out there, to make people see our way no matter what.\"\n Lissa gave an uncomfortable laugh. \"Sounds like compulsion.\"\n \"So?\"\n I couldn\u0027t see her face, but I could feel her working hard to keep it as straight as possible. \"Are you out of your mind? Compulsion\u0027s forbidden. It\u0027s wrong.\"\n \"Only to some people. And apparently not you since you\u0027re pretty good at it.\"\n She stiffened. \"Why would you think that?\"\n \"Because someone - a couple people, actually - hinted at it.\" People? I tried to remember what Christian and I had said in the feeder room. We\u0027d never mentioned her by name, though both of us had bragged about having seen someone use compulsion. And apparently, Jesse had noticed other things about her. \"Besides, it\u0027s actually kind of obvious. People love you. You\u0027ve gotten out of so much trouble, and I finally figured out why. You\u0027ve been working people over this whole time. I was watching you in class the other day when you convinced Mr. Hill to let Christian work with you on that project. He never would have let anyone else do that.\"\n I\u0027d been with them in class that day. Lissa actually had used compulsion on her teacher to get help for Christian. She\u0027d been so caught up in her pleas that she\u0027d compelled Mr. Hill without even realizing it. Compared to other things I\u0027d seen her do, it had actually been a pretty weak show of compulsion. No one had noticed. Well, almost no one.\n \"Look,\" Lissa said uneasily, \"I seriously have no idea what you\u0027re talking about. I need to go to bed.\"\n Jesse\u0027s face grew excited. \"No, it\u0027s okay. We think it\u0027s cool. We want to help you - or actually, we want you to help us. I can\u0027t believe I never noticed it before. You\u0027re really good at it, and we need you to show us. Plus, none of the other Man? chapters has a Dragomir. We\u0027d be the first to have every royal family represented.\"\n She sighed. \"If I could use compulsion, I\u0027d make you guys go away. I told you, I\u0027m not interested.\"\n \"But we need you!\" exclaimed Ralf. Jesse shot him a sharp look and then turned his smile back on Lissa. I had this weird feeling he might actually be trying to compel her, but it had absolutely no effect on her - or me, since I was watching through her eyes.\n \"It\u0027s not just about you helping us. There are groups of Man? at every school,\" said Jesse. He was leaning close, and suddenly, he didn\u0027t look very friendly anymore. \"Its members are all over the world. Be a part of it, and you\u0027ll have the connections to do whatever you want with your life. And if we can all learn to work compulsion, we can stop the Moroi government from doing stupid things - we can make sure the queen and everyone else make the right decision. Everything about this is good for you!\"\n \"I\u0027m doing fine on my own, thanks,\" she said, stepping back. \"And I\u0027m not really sure you know what\u0027s best for the Moroi.\"\n \"Fine? With your Strigoi boyfriend and slutty wannabe guardian?\" exclaimed Ralf. He spoke loudly enough to get Eddie\u0027s attention, and Eddie did not look happy.\n \"Be quiet,\" Jesse told him angrily. He turned to Lissa. \"He shouldn\u0027t have said that...but he\u0027s kind of right. Your family\u0027s reputation is all on you, and the way you\u0027re going, no one\u0027s taking you seriously. The queen\u0027s already trying to keep you in line and get you away from Ozera. You\u0027re going to crash and burn.\"\n Lissa was growing angrier and angrier. \"You have no idea what you\u0027re talking about. And - \" She frowned. \"What do you mean she\u0027s trying to get me away from Christian?\"\n \"She wants to marr - \" Ralf started to speak, but Jesse immediately cut him off.\n \"That\u0027s exactly what I\u0027m talking about,\" said Jesse. \"We know all sorts of things that could affect you and help you - you and Christian.\"\n I had a feeling that Ralf had been about to mention the queen\u0027s plans to marry Lissa off to Adrian. I was puzzling out how he would know about that until I recalled again that Ralf was related to the Vodas. Priscilla Voda was the queen\u0027s adviser and best friend. She knew all of the queen\u0027s plans and had probably told Ralf. His relationship to her must have been closer than I\u0027d realized.\n \"Tell me,\" Lissa demanded. The thought of using compulsion on him actually crossed her mind, but she dismissed it. She wouldn\u0027t lower herself to that. \"What do you know about Christian?\"\n \"No free information,\" said Jesse. \"Come to a meeting and we\u0027ll tell you everything.\"\n \"Whatever. I\u0027m not interested in your elitist connections, and I don\u0027t know anything about compulsion.\" Despite her words, she was insanely curious about what he knew.\n She started to turn away, but Jesse grabbed her arm. \"Damn it! You have to - \"\n \"Lissa\u0027s going to bed now,\" said Eddie. He\u0027d shot over as soon as Jesse touched her. \"Remove your hand, or I\u0027ll do it for you.\"\n Jesse glared at Eddie. Like most Moroi-dhampir matchups, Jesse had height, and Eddie had muscle. Of course, Jesse had Ralf\u0027s bulk too, but it wouldn\u0027t matter. Everyone there knew who would win if Eddie went up against them. The beauty of it was that Eddie probably wouldn\u0027t even get in trouble if he claimed he\u0027d done it to save Lissa from harassment.\n Jesse and Ralf slowly backed off. \"We need you,\" said Jesse. \"You\u0027re the only one. Think about it.\"\n When they were gone, Eddie asked, \"Are you okay?\"\n \"Yeah...thanks. God, that was so weird.\" They moved toward the stairs.\n \"What was it about?\"\n \"They\u0027re obsessed with this royal society or something and want me to join so they can have every royal family in it. They were kind of fanatic about it.\" Eddie knew about spirit, but she wasn\u0027t comfortable reminding him what a badass she was with compulsion.\n He opened the door for her. \"Well, they can annoy you all they want, but they can\u0027t make you join something you don\u0027t want to.\"\n \"Yeah, I suppose.\" Part of her still wondered what they knew about Christian or if it had been a bluff. \"I just hope they don\u0027t get too annoying.\"\n \"Don\u0027t worry,\" he told her, his voice hard. \"I\u0027ll make sure they don\u0027t.\"\n I slipped back to my body and opened the door to my own dorm. Halfway up the stairs, I discovered I was smiling. I certainly didn\u0027t want Jesse and Ralf bothering Lissa, but if it came down to Eddie having to rough them up? Yeah. I wouldn\u0027t mind seeing them get a little payback for what they\u0027d done to others. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/shadow-kiss-vampire-academy-3/page-21.html","bookId":2062,"book":{"id":2062,"title":"Shadow Kiss (Vampire Academy #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Vampire Academy Series 3: Shadow Kiss \n A little background...
