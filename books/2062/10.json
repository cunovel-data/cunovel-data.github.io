Once again, I found my own life put on hold for someone else\u0027s.\\n\\n \"How was your penance?\" he asked as we walked across campus from his dorm.\\n\\n I stifled a yawn. I hadn\u0027t been able to sleep well last night, both because of my feelings for Dimitri and because of what Father Andrew had told me. Nonetheless, I kept a sharp eye out. This was the location where Stan had attacked us twice before, and besides, the guardians were sick and twisted enough to come after me on a day when I was so exhausted.\\n\\n \"It was okay. The priest let us go early.\"\\n\\n \"Us?\"\\n\\n \"Dimitri came and helped me. I think he felt bad about me being stuck with that work.\"\\n\\n \"Either that or he has nothing else to do now that he\u0027s not doing your extra sessions.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe, but I doubt it. All in all, I guess it wasn\u0027t that bad a day.\" Unless you considered learning about spiteful ghosts bad.\\n\\n \"I had a great day,\" said Christian, the smallest amount of smugness in his voice.\\n\\n I repressed the urge to roll my eyes. \"Yeah, I know.\"\\n\\n He and Lissa had taken advantage of their guardianless day to take advantage of each other. I supposed I should be glad they\u0027d held off until Eddie and I weren\u0027t around, but in a lot of ways, it didn\u0027t matter. True, when I was awake, I could block out all of the details, but I still knew what was going on. A bit of the jealousy and anger I\u0027d felt from the last time they\u0027d been together returned. It was the same problem all over again: Lissa doing all the things I couldn\u0027t do.\\n\\n I was dying to go eat breakfast. I could smell French toast and hot maple syrup. Carbs wrapped in more carbs. Yum. But Christian wanted blood before we ate solid food, and his needs trumped mine. They come first. He\u0027d apparently skipped his daily blood dose yesterday - probably to maximize his romantic time.\\n\\n The feeder room wasn\u0027t crowded, but we still had to wait.\\n\\n \"Hey,\" I said. \"Do you know Brett Ozera? You\u0027re related, right?\" After my encounter with Jill, I\u0027d finally put some pieces together. Brett Ozera and Dane Zeklos had reminded me of how Brandon had looked the day of Stan\u0027s first attack. The disaster of that attack had made me completely forget about Brandon, but the coincidences here suddenly stirred my curiosity. All three had been beaten up. All three had been in denial.\\n\\n Christian nodded. \"Yeah, in the way we\u0027re all kind of related. I don\u0027t know him that well - he\u0027s like a third or fourth cousin or something. His branch of the family hasn\u0027t had much to do with mine since ... well, you know.\"\\n\\n \"I heard something weird about him.\" I then related what Jill had told me about Dane and Brett.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s weird,\" agreed Christian. \"But people get in fights.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, but there are some weird connections here. And royals aren\u0027t usually on the losing ends of fights - all three of these guys were.\"\\n\\n \"Well, maybe that\u0027s it. You know how it\u0027s been. A lot of royals are getting pissed off that non-royals want to change how guardians are assigned and learn to start fighting. That\u0027s the whole point of Jesse and Ralf\u0027s stupid little club. They want to make sure royals stay on top. Non-royals are probably getting just as pissed off and fighting back.\"\\n\\n \"So, what, some kind of vigilante is out making royals pay?\"\\n\\n \"Wouldn\u0027t be the weirdest thing that\u0027s happened around here,\" he pointed out.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s for damn sure,\" I muttered.\\n\\n Christian\u0027s name was called, and he peered ahead. \"Look at that,\" he said happily. \"Alice again.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t get your fascination with her,\" I observed as we approached the old feeder. \"Lissa\u0027s always kind of excited to see her too. But Alice is nuts.\"\\n\\n \"I know,\" he said. \"That\u0027s what\u0027s so great.\"\\n\\n Alice greeted us as Christian sat down beside her. I leaned against the wall, arms crossed over my chest. Feeling uppity, I said, \"Alice, the scenery hasn\u0027t changed. It\u0027s exactly the same as last time.\"\\n\\n She turned her dazed eyes on me. \"Patience, Rose. You must be patient. And prepared. Are you prepared?\"\\n\\n The switch in subject threw me a little. It was like talking to Jill, except less sane. \"Um, prepared how? For the scenery?\"\\n\\n In what had to be a prime moment of irony, she looked at me as though I were the one who was crazy. \"Armed. Are you armed? You\u0027re going to protect us, aren\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n I reached inside my coat and pulled out the practice stake I\u0027d been given for the field experience. \"Got you covered,\" I said.\\n\\n She looked immensely relieved and apparently couldn\u0027t tell the difference between a real stake and a fake one. \"Good,\" she said. \"Now we\u0027ll be safe.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s right,\" said Christian. \"With Rose armed, we have nothing to worry about. The Moroi world can rest easy.\"\\n\\n Alice was oblivious to his sarcasm. \"Yes. Well, nowhere is ever safe.\"\\n\\n I concealed the stake again. \"We\u0027re safe. We\u0027ve got the best guardians in the world protecting us, not to mention the wards. Strigoi aren\u0027t getting in here.\"\\n\\n I didn\u0027t add what I\u0027d recently learned: that Strigoi could get humans to break the wards. Wards were invisible lines of power that were composed of all four elements. They were created when four Moroi, each one strong in a different element, walked around an area and laid the magic in a circle upon the ground, creating a protective border. Moroi magic was imbued with life, and a strong field of it kept out Strigoi, since they were devoid of life. So wards were frequently laid around Moroi dwellings. Tons of them were laid around this school. Since stakes were also imbued with all four elements, driving a stake through a ward line in the ground pierced the ward and canceled out the protective effect. This had never been much of a concern because Strigoi couldn\u0027t touch stakes. However, in some recent attacks, humans - who could touch stakes - had served Strigoi and broken some wards. We believed the Strigoi I\u0027d killed had been the ringleaders in that group, but we still didn\u0027t know for sure.\\n\\n Alice studied me closely with her cloudy eyes, almost as though she knew what I was thinking. \"Nowhere is safe. Wards fade. Guardians die.\"\\n\\n I glanced over at Christian, who shrugged in a sort of what did you expect from her? kind of way.\\n\\n \"If you guys are done with your girl talk, can I eat now?\" he asked.\\n\\n Alice was more than happy to comply; he was her first hit of the day. She soon forgot about wards or anything else and simply lost herself to the ecstasy of his bite. I forgot about wards too. I had a one-track mind, really: I still wanted to know if Mason had been real or not. The priest\u0027s frightening explanation aside, I had to admit Mason\u0027s visits hadn\u0027t been threatening, just scary. If he was out to get me, he was kind of doing a half-assed job of it. Once again, I started putting more stock in the stress-and-fatigue theory.\\n\\n \"Now it\u0027s time for me to eat,\" I said when Christian finished. I was pretty sure I could smell bacon now. That\u0027d probably make Christian happy. He could wrap it around his French toast.\\n\\n We\u0027d barely stepped out of the room when Lissa came running up to us, Eddie trailing behind. Excitement lit her face, though the feelings in the bond weren\u0027t exactly happy.\\n\\n \"Did you hear?\" she asked, a little breathless.\\n\\n \"Hear what?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"You have to hurry - go pack your things. We\u0027re going to Victor\u0027s trial. Right now.\"\\n\\n There\u0027d been no warning at all about when Victor\u0027s trial would even occur, let alone that someone had apparently decided we could go. Christian and I exchanged brief, startled looks and then hurried off to his room to gather our things.\\n\\n Packing was a breeze. My bag was ready to go already, and Christian only took a minute to throw his together. In less than a half hour, we were out on the Academy\u0027s landing strip. Two private jets sat in attendance, one of which was fired up and waiting to go. A couple of Moroi hurried about, doing last-minute things with the plane and the runway.\\n\\n No one seemed to know what was going on. Lissa had simply been told that she, Christian, and I were going to testify and that Eddie could come along to continue his field experience. There\u0027d been no explanation as to why things had changed, and a weird mix of eagerness and apprehension crackled around us. We all wanted to see Victor locked away for good, but now that we were actually faced with the reality of the trial and of seeing him - well, it was kind of scary.\\n\\n A few guardians lingered near the steps going up to the plane. I recognized them as the ones who had helped capture Victor. They were probably going to do double duty and serve as witnesses and as our protection. Dimitri hovered near the outskirts, and I hurried over to him.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" I gulped out. \"I\u0027m so sorry.\"\\n\\n He turned toward me, his face schooled to that perfect picture of neutrality that he was so good at. \"Sorry for what?\"\\n\\n \"For all the horrible things I said yesterday. You did it - you really did it. You got them to let us go.\"\\n\\n Despite my nervousness about seeing Victor, I was filled with elation. Dimitri had come through. I\u0027d known all along that he really cared about me - this just proved it. If there hadn\u0027t been so many people around, I would have hugged him.\\n\\n Dimitri\u0027s face didn\u0027t change. \"It wasn\u0027t me, Rose. I had nothing to do with it.\"\\n\\n Alberta signaled that we could board, and he turned away to join the others. I stood frozen for a moment, watching him and trying to figure out what had happened. If he hadn\u0027t intervened, then why were we going? Lissa\u0027s diplomatic efforts had been shot down a while ago. Why the change of heart?\\n\\n My friends were already on board, so I hurried to catch up. As soon as I stepped into the cabin, a voice called to me. \"Little dhampir! About time you got here.\"\\n\\n I looked and saw Adrian waving, a drink in his hand. Great. We\u0027d had to beg and plead to go along, yet Adrian had somehow just glided on in. Lissa and Christian were sitting together, so I joined Eddie in the hopes of staying away from Adrian. Eddie gave me the window seat. Adrian moved to the seat in front of us, though, and might as well have been sitting in our row, as often as he turned around to talk to me. His chatter and outrageous flirting indicated he\u0027d been sipping cocktails long before the rest of us had come aboard. I kind of wished I\u0027d had a few myself once we were airborne. A wicked headache set in almost immediately after liftoff, and I entertained a fantasy of vodka numbing the pain.\\n\\n \"We\u0027re going to Court,\" Adrian said. \"Aren\u0027t you excited about it?\"\\n\\n I closed my eyes and rubbed my temples. \"About which one? The royal one or the legal one?\"\\n\\n \"The royal one. Did you bring a dress?\"\\n\\n \"Nobody told me to.\"\\n\\n \"So ... that\u0027s a \u0027no.\u0027\"\\n\\n \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"Yes? I thought you meant no.\"\\n\\n I opened one eye and glared. \"I did mean no, and you know it. No, I did not bring a dress.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027ll get you one,\" he said loftily.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re going to take me shopping? I\u0027m going to go out on a limb and guess they won\u0027t consider you a reliable chaperone.\"\\n\\n \"Shopping? As if. There are tailors that live there. We\u0027ll get you something custom-made.\"\\n\\n \"We\u0027re not staying that long. And do I really need a dress for what we\u0027re doing there?\"\\n\\n \"No, I\u0027d just kind of like to see you in one.\"\\n\\n I sighed and leaned my head against the window. The pain in my skull was still throbbing. It was like the air was pressing in on me. Something flashed in my peripheral vision, and I turned in surprise, but there was nothing but stars outside the window.\\n\\n \"Something black,\" he continued. \"Satin, I think... maybe with lace trim. Do you like lace? Some women think it itches.\"\\n\\n \"Adrian.\" It was like a hammer, a hammer inside and outside my head.\\n\\n \"You could get a nice velvet trim too, though. That wouldn\u0027t itch.\"\\n\\n \"Adrian.\" Even my eye sockets seemed to hurt.\\n\\n \"And then a slit up the side to show off what great legs you have. It could go nearly to the hip and have this cute little bow - \"\\n\\n \"Adrian!\" Something inside of me burst. \"Will you shut the hell up for five seconds?\" I yelled so loud that the pilot had probably heard me. Adrian had that rare look of astonishment on his face.\\n\\n Alberta, sitting across the aisle from Adrian, shot up in her seat. \"Rose,\" she exclaimed. \"What\u0027s going on?\"\\n\\n I gritted my teeth and rubbed my forehead. \"I have the worst fucking headache in the world, and he won\u0027t shut up.\" I didn\u0027t even realize I\u0027d sworn in front of an instructor until several seconds later. From the other side of my field of vision, I thought I saw something else - another shadow darting through the plane, reminding me of black wings. Like a bat or a raven. I covered my eyes. There was nothing flying through the plane. \"God, why won\u0027t it go away?\"\\n\\n I expected Alberta to chastise me for the outburst, but instead, Christian spoke: \"She hasn\u0027t eaten today. She was really hungry earlier.\"\\n\\n I uncovered my eyes. Alberta\u0027s face was filled with concern, and Dimitri now hovered behind her. More shadowy shapes flitted across my vision. Most were indistinct, but I could have sworn I saw something that looked like a skull mixed in with the darkness. I blinked rapidly, and it all disappeared. Alberta turned to one of the flight attendants. \"Can you get her something to eat? And find a painkiller?\"\\n\\n \"Where\u0027s it at?\" Dimitri asked me. \"The pain?\"\\n\\n With all of this attention, my explosion suddenly seemed excessive. \"It\u0027s a headache...I\u0027m sure it\u0027ll go away...\" Seeing his stern look, I pointed to the center of my forehead. \"It\u0027s like something pushing on my skull. And there\u0027s pain kind of behind my eyes. I keep feeling like...well, it\u0027s like I\u0027ve got something in my eye. I think I\u0027m seeing a shadow or something. Then I blink and it\u0027s gone.\"\\n\\n \"Ah,\" said Alberta. \"That\u0027s a migraine symptom - having vision problems. It\u0027s called an aura. People sometimes get it before the headache sets in.\"\\n\\n \"An aura?\" I asked, startled. I glanced up at Adrian. He was looking at me over the top of his seat, his long arms hanging over the back of it.\\n\\n \"Not that kind,\" he said, a small smile turning up his lips. \"Same name. Like Court and court. Migraine auras are images and light you see when a migraine\u0027s coming on. They have nothing to do with the auras around people I see. But I tell you ... the aura I can see ... the one around you ... wow.\"\\n\\n \"Black?\"\\n\\n \"And then some. It\u0027s obvious even after all the drinks I\u0027ve had. Never seen anything like it.\"\\n\\n I didn\u0027t exactly know what to make of that, but then the flight attendant returned with a banana, a granola bar, and some ibuprofen. It was a far cry from French toast, but it sounded good on my empty stomach. I consumed it all and then propped a pillow up against the window. Closing my eyes, I rested my head and hoped I could sleep the headache off before we landed. Mercifully, everyone else stayed quiet.\\n\\n I had drifted off a little when I felt a slight touch on my arm. \"Rose?\"\\n\\n Opening my eyes, I peered at Lissa as she sat in Eddie\u0027s seat. Those bat-winged shapes flitted behind her, and my head still hurt. In those swirling shadows, I again saw what looked like a face, this time with a wide gaping mouth and eyes like fire. I flinched.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re still in pain?\" Lissa asked, peering at me. I blinked, and the face was gone.\\n\\n \"Yeah, I - oh no.\" I realized what she was going to do. \"Don\u0027t do it. Don\u0027t waste it on me.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s easy,\" she said. \"It hardly fazes me.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, but the more you use it... the more it hurts you in the long run. Even if it\u0027s easy now.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ll worry about that later. Here.\"\\n\\n She clasped my hand between hers and closed her eyes. Through our bond, I felt the magic welling up in her as she drew upon spirit\u0027s healing power. To her, magic felt warm and golden. I\u0027d been healed before, and it always came through to me as varying temperatures: hot, then cold, then hot, etc. But this time, when she released the magic and sent it into me, I didn\u0027t feel anything except a very faint tingle. Her eyelids fluttered open.\\n\\n \"Wh - what happened?\" she asked.\\n\\n \"Nothing,\" I said. \"The headache\u0027s still going strong.\"\\n\\n \"But I...\" The confusion and shock on her face mirrored what I sensed in her. \"I had it. I felt the magic. It worked.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know, Liss. It\u0027s okay, really. You haven\u0027t been off the meds that long, you know.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, but I healed Eddie the other day without any problems. And Adrian,\" she added dryly. He was hanging over the seat again, watching us intently.\\n\\n \"Those were scrapes,\" I said. \"This is a five-alarm migraine we\u0027re talking about. Maybe you\u0027ve got to build back up.\"\\n\\n Lissa bit her lower lip. \"You don\u0027t think the pills permanently hurt my magic, do you?\"\\n\\n \"Nah,\" said Adrian, head tilted to the side. \"You lit up like a supernova when you were summoning it. You had magic. I just don\u0027t think it had any effect on her.\"\\n\\n \"Why not?\" she demanded.\\n\\n \"Maybe she\u0027s got something you can\u0027t heal.\"\\n\\n \"A headache?\" I asked in disbelief.\\n\\n He shrugged. \"What do I look like, a doctor? I don\u0027t know. Just telling you what I saw.\"\\n\\n I sighed and placed a hand on my forehead. \"Well, I appreciate the help, Liss, and I appreciate your annoying commentary, Adrian. But I think sleep might be the best thing for now. Maybe it\u0027s stress or something.\" Sure, why not? Stress was the answer to everything lately. Ghosts. Incurable headaches. Weird faces floating in the air. \"Probably can\u0027t heal that.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe,\" she said, sounding as though she took personal offense at me having something she couldn\u0027t fix. Inside her mind, though, her accusations were turned toward herself, not me. She worried she wasn\u0027t good enough.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s okay,\" I said soothingly. \"You\u0027re just getting your stride back. Once you\u0027re up to full power, I\u0027ll go crack a rib or something so we can test it.\"\\n\\n She groaned. \"The horrible part is that I don\u0027t think you\u0027re joking.\" After a quick squeeze of my hand, she stood up. \"Sleep well.\"\\n\\n She left, and I soon realized Eddie wasn\u0027t coming back. He\u0027d taken a new seat so that I\u0027d have more room. Appreciative, I fluffed and repositioned the pillow while stretching my legs out as best I could across the seats. A few more phantom clouds danced across my vision, and then I closed my eyes to sleep.\\n\\n I woke up later when the plane touched down, the sounds of its engines kicking into reverse startling me out of a deep sleep. To my relief, the headache was gone. So were the weird shapes floating around me.\\n\\n \"Better?\" Lissa asked when I stood up and yawned.\\n\\n I nodded. \"Much. Better still if I can get some real food.\"\\n\\n \"Well,\" she laughed, \"somehow I doubt there\u0027s any shortage of food around here.\"\\n\\n She was right. Glancing out the windows, I tried to get my first look at our surroundings. We\u0027d made it. We were at the Moroi Royal Court. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/shadow-kiss-vampire-academy-3/page-10.html","bookId":2062,"book":{"id":2062,"title":"Shadow Kiss (Vampire Academy #3)","description":"Storyline: Vampire Academy Series 3: Shadow Kiss \\n A little background... I am in my mid 20\u0027s and a high school teacher who loves to read when I can but doesn\u0027t get much time to do it in. I picked up the twilight series a year ago at a students request and was pleasantly surprised. Once the series was finished I needed another one! Before Twilight I had not been into teen romance/ fantasy books especially with vampires and such. I saw a book-list of recommendations by Twilight followers and picked up the \"House of Night\" series by PC Cast. This was worth reading and I am waiting for the next book to come.
