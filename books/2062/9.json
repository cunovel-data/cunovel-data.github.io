{"id":110686,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"Nine WITH SO MANY MOROI tracing their roots back to Eastern Europe, Orthodox Christianity was the dominant religion on campus. Other religions were represented too, and I\u0027d say all in all, only about half of the student body attended any sort of services regularly. Lissa was one such student. She went to church every Sunday because she believed. Christian also attended. He did it because she went and because it made him look good and seem less likely to become Strigoi. Since Strigoi couldn\u0027t enter holy ground, regular church service provided a small front of respectability for him. When I wasn\u0027t sleeping in, I showed up at church for the social aspect. Lissa and my friends usually hung out and did something fun afterward, so church made for a good meeting spot. If God minded me using his chapel as a way to further my social life, He hadn\u0027t let me know. Either that, or He was biding his time before punishing me. When the service ended that Sunday, however, I had to stick around the chapel, because that was where my community service was going to happen. When the place had cleared out, I was surprised to see one other person had lingered with me: Dimitri. \"What are you doing here?\" I asked. \"Thought you might need some help. I hear the priest wants to do a lot of housecleaning.\" \"Yeah, but you\u0027re not the one being punished here. And this is your day off too. We - well, everyone else - spent the whole week battling it out, but you guys were the ones picking the fights the whole time.\" In fact, I noticed now that Dimitri had a couple bruises too - though not nearly as many as Stan had. It had been a long week for everyone, and it was only the first of six. \"What else would I do today?\" \"I could think of a hundred other things,\" I noted dryly. \"There\u0027s probably a John Wayne movie on somewhere that you haven\u0027t seen.\" He shook his head. \"No, there isn\u0027t. I\u0027ve seen them all. Look - the priest is waiting for us.\" I turned around. Sure enough. Father Andrew stood at the front, watching us expectantly. He\u0027d taken off the rich robes he\u0027d worn during service and now stood in simple slacks and a button down shirt. He looked like he was ready to work too, and I wondered whatever happened to Sunday being a day of rest. As Dimitri and I approached to get our assignments, I pondered what could have actually made Dimitri stay here in the first place. Surely he hadn\u0027t really wanted to work on his day off. I wasn\u0027t used to puzzles with him. His intentions were usually straightforward, and I had to assume there was a simple explanation now. It just wasn\u0027t clear yet. \"Thank you both for volunteering to help me.\" Father Andrew smiled at us. I tried not to scoff at the \"volunteering\" reference. He was a Moroi in his late forties, with thinning gray hair. Even without much faith in religion, I still liked and respected him. \"We aren\u0027t doing anything particularly complex today,\" he continued. \"It\u0027s a bit boring, really. We\u0027ll have to do the regular cleaning, of course, and then I\u0027d like to sort the boxes of old supplies I have sitting up in the attic.\" \"We\u0027re happy to do whatever you need,\" Dimitri said solemnly. I repressed a sigh and tried not to think of all the other things I could be doing. We set to it. I was put on mop duty, and Dimitri took over dusting and polishing the wooden pews. He appeared thoughtful and intent as he cleaned, looking like he actually took pride in his work. I was still trying to figure out why he was here at all. Don\u0027t get me wrong; I was happy to have him. His presence made me feel better, and of course I always loved watching him. I thought maybe he was there to get more information out of me about what had happened that day with Stan, Christian, and Brandon. Or maybe he wanted to chastise me about the other day with Stan, where I\u0027d been accused of jumping into battle for selfish reasons. These seemed like likely explanations, yet he never said a word. Even when the priest stepped out of the sanctuary to go to his office, Dimitri continued working quietly. I would have figured if he\u0027d had anything to say, he would have done it then. When we finished the cleaning, Father Andrew had us haul box after box of stuff down from the attic and into a storeroom at the back of the chapel. Lissa and Christian frequently used that attic as a secret getaway, and I wondered if having it cleaner would be a pro or a con for their romantic interludes. Maybe they would abandon it, and I could start getting some sleep. With all of the stuff downstairs, the three of us settled on the floor and began sorting it all out. Father Andrew gave us instructions on what to save and what to throw out, and it was a relief to be off my feet for a change this week. He made small talk as we worked, asking me about classes and other things. It wasn\u0027t so bad. And as we worked, a thought came to me. I\u0027d done a good job convincing myself that Mason had been a delusion brought on by lack of sleep, but getting assurance from an authority figure that ghosts weren\u0027t real would go a long way toward making me feel better. \"Hey,\" I said to Father Andrew. \"Do you believe in ghosts? I mean, is there any mention of them in - \" I gestured around us. \" - in this stuff?\" The question clearly surprised him, but he didn\u0027t appear to take offense at me calling his vocation and life\u0027s work \"this stuff.\" Or at the fact that I was obviously ignorant about it all, despite seventeen years of sitting through services. A bemused expression crossed his face, and he paused in his work. \"Well ... it depends on how you define \u0027ghost,\u0027 I suppose.\" I tapped a theology book with my finger. \"The whole point of this is that when you die, you go to heaven or hell. That makes ghosts just stories, right? They\u0027re not in the Bible or anything.\" \"Again,\" he said, \"it depends on your definition. Our faith has always held that after death, the spirit separates from the body and may indeed linger in this world.\" \"What?\" A dusty bowl I was holding dropped out of my hand. Fortunately, it was wood and didn\u0027t break. I quickly retrieved it. That was not the answer I\u0027d been expecting. \"For how long? Forever?\" \"No, no, of course not. That flies in the face of the resurrection and salvation, which form the cornerstone of our beliefs. But it\u0027s believed the soul can stay on earth for three to forty days after death. It eventually receives a \u0027temporary\u0027 judgment that sends it on from this world to heaven or hell - although no one will truly experience either until the actual Judgment Day, when the soul and body are reunited to live out eternity as one.\" The salvation stuff was lost on me. The \"three to forty days\" was what caught my attention. I completely forgot about my sorting. \"Yeah, but is it true or not? Are spirits really walking the earth for forty days after death?\" \"Ah, Rose. Those who have to ask if faith is true are opening up a discussion they may not be ready for.\" I had a feeling he was right. I sighed and turned back to the box in front of me. \"But,\" he said kindly, \"if it helps you, some of these ideas parallel folk beliefs from Eastern Europe about ghosts that existed before the spread of Christianity. Those traditions have long upheld the idea of spirits staying around for a short time after death - particularly if the person in question died young or violently.\" I froze. Whatever progress I\u0027d made in convincing myself Mason had been brought on by stress instantly vanished. Young or violently. \"Why?\" I asked in a small voice. \"Why would they stay? Is it... is it for revenge?\" \"I\u0027m sure there are some who believe that, just as some believe it\u0027s because the soul has trouble finding peace after something so unsettling.\" \"What do you believe?\" I asked. He smiled. \"I believe the soul separates from the body, just as our fathers teach us, but I doubt the soul\u0027s time on earth is anything the living can perceive. It\u0027s not like in the movies, with ghosts haunting buildings or coming to visit those they knew. I envision these spirits as more of an energy existing around us, something beyond our perception as they wait to move on and find peace. Ultimately, what matters is what happens beyond this earth when we attain the eternal life our savior bought for us with his great sacrifice. That\u0027s what\u0027s important.\" I wondered if Father Andrew would be so quick to say that if he\u0027d seen what I\u0027d seen. Young or violently. Both had applied to Mason, and he had died less than forty days ago. That sad, sad face came back to me, and I wondered what it had meant. Revenge? Or could he truly not find peace? And how did Father Andrew\u0027s theology about heaven and hell fit with someone like me, who had died and come back to life? Victor Dashkov had said I\u0027d gone to the world of the dead and returned when Lissa had healed me. What world of the dead? Was that heaven or hell? Or was it another way of referring to this in-between state on earth that Father Andrew was talking about? I didn\u0027t say anything after that, because the idea of a revenge-seeking Mason was so startling. Father Andrew sensed the change in me, but he obviously didn\u0027t know what had brought it about. He tried to coax me out. \"I just got some new books in from a friend in another parish. Interesting stories about St. Vladimir.\" He tilted his head. \"Are you still interested in him? And Anna?\" Theoretically, I was. Until we\u0027d met Adrian, we\u0027d only known of two other spirit users. One was our former teacher, Ms. Karp, who\u0027d gone completely nuts from spirit and become a Strigoi to stop the madness. The other person was St. Vladimir, the school\u0027s namesake. He\u0027d lived centuries ago and had brought his guardian, Anna, back from the dead, just as Lissa had me. It had made Anna shadow-kissed and created a bond between them too. Normally, Lissa and I tried to get our hands on everything we could about Anna and Vlad, in order to learn more about ourselves. But, as incredible as it was for me to admit, I had bigger problems right now than the ever-present and ever-puzzling psychic link between Lissa and me. It had just been trumped by a ghost who could possibly be pissed off over my role in his untimely death. \"Yeah,\" I said evasively, not making eye contact. \"I\u0027m interested...but I don\u0027t think I can get to it anytime soon. I\u0027m kind of busy with all this...you know, field experience stuff.\" I fell silent again. He took the hint and let me work on without further interruption. Dimitri never said a word throughout any of this. When we finally finished sorting, Father Andrew told us we had one more task before our work was done. He pointed to some boxes that we\u0027d organized and repacked. \"I need you to carry these over to the elementary campus,\" he said. \"Leave them off at the Moroi dorm there. Ms. Davis has been teaching Sunday school for some of the kindergartners and might be able to use those.\" It would take at least two trips between Dimitri and me, and the elementary campus was a fair distance away. Still, that put me one step closer to freedom. \"Why are you interested in ghosts?\" Dimitri asked me on our first trip. \"Just making conversation,\" I said. \"I can\u0027t see your face right now, but I have a feeling you\u0027re lying again.\" \"Jeez, everyone thinks the worst of me lately. Stan accused me of glory-seeking.\" \"I heard about that,\" said Dimitri, as we rounded a corner. The buildings of the elementary campus loomed up in front of us. \"That might have been a little unfair of him.\" \"A little, huh?\" Hearing him admit that thrilled me, but it didn\u0027t change my anger against Stan. That dark, grouchy feeling that had plagued me lately sprang to life. \"Well, thanks, but I\u0027m starting to lose faith in this field experience. Sometimes in the whole Academy.\" \"You don\u0027t mean that.\" \"I don\u0027t know. The school just seems so caught up in rules and policies that don\u0027t have anything to do with real life. I saw what was out there, comrade. I went right to the monster\u0027s lair. In some ways ... I don\u0027t know if this really prepares us.\" I expected him to argue, but to my surprise he said, \"Sometimes I agree.\" I nearly stumbled as we stepped inside one of the two Moroi dorms on the elementary campus. The lobby looked a lot like the ones on the secondary campus. \"Really?\" I asked. \"Really,\" he said, a small smile on his face. \"I mean, I don\u0027t agree that novices should be put out in the world when they\u0027re ten or anything, but sometimes I\u0027ve thought the field experience should actually be in the field. I probably learned more in my first year as a guardian than I did in all my years of training. Well... maybe not all. But it\u0027s a different situation, absolutely.\" We exchanged looks, pleased over our agreement. Something warm fluttered up in me, putting the lid on my earlier anger. Dimitri understood my frustration with the system, but then, Dimitri understood me. He glanced around, but there was no one at the desk. A few students in their early teens were working or talking in the lobby. \"Oh,\" I said, shifting the weight of the box I held. \"We\u0027re in the middle school dorm. The younger kids are next door.\" \"Yes, but Ms. Davis lives in this building. Let me try to find her and see where she wants these.\" He set his box down carefully. \"I\u0027ll be right back.\" I watched him go and set my own box down. Leaning against a wall, I glanced around and nearly jumped when I saw a Moroi girl only a couple feet away. She\u0027d been standing so perfectly still, I hadn\u0027t noticed her. She looked like she could be mid-teens - thirteen or fourteen - but she was tall, much taller than me. The slimness of her Moroi build made her look even taller. Her hair was a cloud of brown curls, and she had freckles - rare among the normally pale Moroi - across her face. Her eyes widened when she saw me looking at her. \"Oh. My. God. You\u0027re Rose Hathaway, aren\u0027t you?\" \"Yeah,\" I said with surprise. \"Do you know me?\" \"Everyone knows you. I mean, everyone heard about you. You\u0027re the one who ran away. And then you came back and killed those Strigoi. That is so cool. Did you get molnija marks?\" Her words came out in one long string. She hardly took a breath. \"Yeah. I have two.\" Thinking about the tiny tattoos on the back of my neck made my skin itch. Her pale green eyes - if possible - grew wider. \"Oh my God. Wow.\" I usually grew irate when people made a big deal about the molnija marks. After all, the circumstances had not been cool. But this girl was young, and there was something appealing about her. \"What\u0027s your name?\" I asked. \"Jillian - Jill. I mean, just Jill. Not both. Jillian\u0027s my full name. Jill\u0027s what everyone calls me.\" \"Right,\" I said, hiding a smile. \"I figured it out.\" \"I heard Moroi used magic on that trip to fight. Is that true? I would love to do that. I wish someone would teach me. I use air. Do you think I could fight Strigoi with that? Everyone says I\u0027m crazy.\" For centuries, Moroi using magic to fight had been viewed as a sin. Everyone believed it should be used peacefully. Recently, some had started to question that, particularly after Christian had proved useful in the Spokane escape. \"I don\u0027t know,\" I said. \"You should talk to Christian Ozera.\" She gaped. \"Would he talk to me?\" \"If you bring up fighting the establishment, yeah, he\u0027ll talk to you.\" \"Okay, cool. Was that Guardian Belikov?\" she asked, switching subjects abruptly. \"Yeah.\" I swore I thought she might faint then and there. \"Really? He\u0027s even cuter than I heard. He\u0027s your teacher, right? Like, your own personal teacher?\" \"Yeah.\" I wondered where he was. Talking to Jill was exhausting. \"Wow. You know, you guys don\u0027t even act like teacher and student. You seem like friends. Do you hang out when you\u0027re not training?\" \"Er, well, kind of. Sometimes.\" I remembered my earlier thoughts, about how I was one of the few people Dimitri was social with outside of his guardian duties. \"I knew it! I can\u0027t even imagine that - I\u0027d be freaking out all the time around him. I\u0027d never get anything done, but you\u0027re so cool about it all, kind of like, \u0027Yeah, I\u0027m with this totally hot guy, but whatever, it doesn\u0027t matter.\u0027\" I laughed in spite of myself. \"I think you\u0027re giving me more credit than I deserve.\" \"No way. And I don\u0027t believe any of those stories, you know.\" \"Um, stories?\" \"Yeah, about you beating up Christian Ozera.\" \"Thanks,\" I said. Now rumors of my humiliation were trickling down to the lower campus. If I walked over to the elementary dorms, some six-year-old would probably tell me she\u0027d heard that I killed Christian. Jill\u0027s expression turned momentarily uncertain. \"But I didn\u0027t know about the other story.\" \"What other story?\" \"About how you and Adrian Ivashkov are - \" \"No,\" I interrupted, not wanting to hear the rest. \"Whatever you heard, it\u0027s not true.\" \"But it was really romantic.\" \"Then it\u0027s definitely not true.\" Her face fell, and then she perked back up a few seconds later. \"Hey, can you teach me to punch someone?\" \"Wai - What? Why would you want to know that?\" \"Well, I figure if I\u0027m going to fight with magic someday, I should learn to fight the regular way too.\" \"I\u0027m probably not the right person to ask,\" I told her. \"Maybe you should, um, ask your P.E. teacher.\" \"I did!\" Her face looked distraught. \"And he said no.\" I couldn\u0027t help but laugh. \"I was joking about asking him.\" \"Come on, it could help me fight a Strigoi someday.\" My laughter dried up. \"No, it really wouldn\u0027t.\" She bit her lip, still desperate to convince me. \"Well, it would at least help against that psycho.\" \"What? What psycho?\" \"People keep getting beat up around here. Last week it was Dane Zeklos, and just the other day it was Brett.\" \"Dane ...\" I ran through my knowledge of Moroi genealogy. There were a gazillion Zeklos students around. \"That\u0027s Jesse\u0027s younger brother, yeah?\" Jill nodded. \"Yup. One of our teachers was so mad, too, but Dane wouldn\u0027t say a word. Neither would Brett.\" \"Brett who?\" \"Ozera.\" I did a double take. \"Ozera?\" I had the impression she was really excited to tell me things I didn\u0027t know. \"He\u0027s my friend Aimee\u0027s boyfriend. He was all bruised up yesterday - had some weird things that looked like welts, too. Maybe burns? But he wasn\u0027t as bad as Dane. And when Mrs. Callahan asked him about it, Brett convinced her it was nothing, and she let it go, which was weird. He was also in a really good mood - which was also weird, since you\u0027d kind of think getting beat up would bring you down.\" Somewhere in the back of my mind, her words tickled a memory. There was some connection I should be making, but I couldn\u0027t quite grasp it. Between Victor, ghosts, and the field experiences, it was honestly a wonder I could string words together anymore. \"So can you teach me so that I won\u0027t get beat up?\" Jill asked, clearly hoping she\u0027d convinced me. She balled her fist up. \"I just do this, right? Thumb across the fingers and swing?\" \"Uh, well, it\u0027s a little more complicated than that. You need to stand a certain way, or you\u0027ll hurt yourself more than the other person. There are a lot of things you need to do with your elbows and hips.\" \"Show me, please?\" she begged. \"I bet you\u0027re really good.\" I was really good, but corrupting minors was one offense I didn\u0027t yet have on my record, and I preferred to keep it that way. Fortunately, Dimitri came back just then with Ms. Davis. \"Hey,\" I told him. \"I have someone who wants to meet you. Dimitri, this is Jill. Jill, Dimitri.\" He looked surprised, but he smiled and shook her hand. She turned bright red and became speechless for a change. As soon as he released her hand, she stammered out a goodbye and ran off. We finished up with Ms. Davis and headed back toward the chapel for our second load. \"Jill knew who I was,\" I told Dimitri as we walked. \"She had kind of a hero-worship thing going on.\" \"Does that surprise you?\" he asked. \"That younger students would look up to you?\" \"I don\u0027t know. I just never thought about it. I don\u0027t think I\u0027m that good of a role model.\" \"I disagree. You\u0027re outgoing, dedicated, and excel at everything you do. You\u0027ve earned more respect than you think.\" I gave him a sidelong glance. \"And yet not enough to go to Victor\u0027s trial, apparently.\" \"Not this again.\" \"Yes, this again! Why don\u0027t you get how major this is? Victor\u0027s a huge threat.\" \"I know he is.\" \"And if he gets loose, he\u0027ll just start in on his crazy plans again.\" \"It\u0027s really unlikely he will get loose, you know. Most of those rumors about the queen letting him off are just that - rumors. You of all people should know not to believe everything you hear.\" I stared stonily ahead, refusing to acknowledge his point. \"You should still let us go. Or\" - I took a deep breath - \"you should at least let Lissa go.\" It was harder for me to say those words than it should have been, but it was something I\u0027d been thinking about. I didn\u0027t think I was a glory seeker like Stan had said, but there was a part of me that always wanted to be the one in the middle of a fight. I wanted to rush forward, doing what was right and helping others. Likewise, I wanted to be there at Victor\u0027s trial. I wanted to look him in the eye and make sure he was punished. But as time went on, it seemed less likely that that would happen. They really weren\u0027t going to let us go. Maybe, though, maybe they\u0027d let one of us go, and if it should be anyone, it should be Lissa. She\u0027d been the target of Victor\u0027s plan, and though her going alone stirred up that nervous idea about how maybe she didn\u0027t need me to guard her, I\u0027d still rather take the chance and see him put away. Dimitri, understanding my need to rush in and take action, seemed surprised by my unusual behavior. \"You\u0027re right - she should be there, but again, it\u0027s nothing I can do anything about. You keep thinking I can control this, but I can\u0027t.\" \"But did you do everything you could?\" I thought back to Adrian\u0027s words in the dream, about how Dimitri could have done more. \"You have a lot of influence. There must be something. Anything.\" \"Not as much influence as you think. I\u0027ve got a high position here at the Academy, but in the rest of the guardian world, I\u0027m still pretty young. And yes, I did actually speak up for you.\" \"Maybe you should have spoken up louder.\" I could sense him shutting down. He\u0027d discuss most things reasonably but wouldn\u0027t encourage me when I was just being a bitch. So, I tried to be more reasonable. \"Victor knows about us,\" I said. \"He could say something.\" \"Victor has bigger things to worry about with this trial than us.\" \"Yeah, but you know him. He doesn\u0027t exactly act like a normal person would. If he feels like he\u0027s lost all hope of getting off, he might decide to bust us just for the sake of revenge.\" I\u0027d never been able to confess my relationship with Dimitri to Lissa, yet our worst enemy knew about it. It was weirder even than Adrian knowing. Victor had figured it out by watching us and gathering data. I guess when you\u0027re a scheming villain, you get good at that stuff. He\u0027d never made the knowledge public, though. Instead, he\u0027d used it against us with the lust charm he\u0027d made from earth magic. A charm like that wouldn\u0027t work if there wasn\u0027t already attraction in place. The charm just cranked things up. Dimitri and I had been all over each other and had been only a heartbeat away from having sex. It had been a pretty smart way for Victor to distract us without using violence. If anyone had tried to attack us, we could have put up a good fight. But turn us loose on each other? We had trouble fighting that. Dimitri was silent for several moments. I knew he knew I had a point. \"Then we\u0027ll have to deal with that as best we can,\" he said at last. \"But if Victor\u0027s going to tell, he\u0027s going to do it whether or not you testify.\" I refused to say anything else until we got to the church. When we did, Father Andrew told us that after going over some more things, he\u0027d decided he really only needed one more box brought over to Ms. Davis. \"I\u0027ll do it,\" I told Dimitri crisply, once the priest was out of earshot. \"You don\u0027t have to come.\" \"Rose, please don\u0027t make a big deal about this.\" \"It is a big deal!\" I hissed. \"And you don\u0027t seem to get it.\" \"I do get it. Do you really think I want to see Victor loose? Do you think I want us all at risk again?\" It was the first time in a long time I\u0027d seen his control on the verge of snapping. \"But I told you, I\u0027ve done all I can do. I\u0027m not like you - I can\u0027t keep making a scene when things don\u0027t go my way.\" \"I do not.\" \"You\u0027re doing it right now.\" He was right. Some part of me knew I\u0027d crossed a line ... but just like with everything else recently, I couldn\u0027t stop talking. \"Why did you even help me today?\" I demanded. \"Why are you here?\" \"Is that so strange?\" he asked. He almost looked hurt. \"Yes. I mean, are you are you trying to spy on me? Figure out why I messed up? Make sure I don\u0027t get into any trouble?\" He studied me, brushing hair out of his eyes. \"Why does there have to be some ulterior motive?\" I wanted to blurt out a hundred different things. Like, if there wasn\u0027t a motive, then that meant he just wanted to spend time with me. And that made no sense, because we both knew we were only supposed to have a teacher-student relationship. He of all people should know that. He was the one who\u0027d told me. \"Because everyone has motives.\" \"Yes. But not always the motives you think.\" He pushed open the door. \"I\u0027ll see you later.\" I watched him go, my feelings a tangle of confusion and anger. If the situation hadn\u0027t been so strange, I would have almost said it was like we\u0027d just gone on a date.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/shadow-kiss-vampire-academy-3/page-9.html","bookId":2062,"book":{"id":2062,"title":"Shadow Kiss (Vampire Academy #3)","description":"Storyline: Vampire Academy Series 3: Shadow Kiss A little background...
