Last night\u0027s Mason sighting was probably something I should have brought up right away. But I didn\u0027t want school officials to have any more reason to think I was losing my mind - even if I was.\n And honestly, I didn\u0027t know I was for sure. Adrian\u0027s analysis of my aura and the story of Anna certainly lent credence to me being on the road to Crazyville. Yet I didn\u0027t feel crazy. Did crazy people know if they really were? Adrian had said they didn\u0027t. Crazy itself was a weird term. I\u0027d learned enough about psychology to know that it was also a very broad classification. Most forms of mental illness were actually very specific and had select symptoms - anxiety, depression, mood swings, etc. I didn\u0027t know where I fell on that scale, if I did at all.\n \"How do you feel about her?\" continued the counselor. \"About your mother?\"\n \"That she\u0027s a great guardian and a so-so mother.\"\n The counselor, whose name was Deirdre, wrote something in her notebook. She was blond and Moroi-slim, clad in a teal cashmere sweater dress. She actually didn\u0027t look much older than me, but certificates on her desk swore she had all sorts of degrees in psychotherapy. Her office was in the administrative building, the same place the headmistress\u0027s office was, and where all other sorts of Academy business was conducted. I\u0027d kind of been hoping for a couch to lie on, like therapists always had on TV, but the best I had was a chair. It was a comfy chair, at least. The walls were covered in nature pictures, things like butterflies and daffodils. I guess they were supposed to be soothing.\n \"Do you want to elaborate on \u0027so-so\u0027?\" Deirdre asked.\n \"It\u0027s an upgrade. A month ago I would have said \u0027horrible.\u0027 What\u0027s this have to do with Mason?\"\n \"Do you want to talk about Mason?\"\n I\u0027d noticed she had a habit of answering my questions with questions.\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" I admitted. \"I guess that\u0027s what I\u0027m here for.\"\n \"How do you feel about him? About his death?\"\n \"Sad. How else should I feel?\"\n \"Angry?\"\n I thought about the Strigoi, their leering faces and casual attitudes toward killing. \"Yeah, a little.\"\n \"Guilty?\"\n \"Sure, of course.\"\n \"Why \u0027of course\u0027?\"\n \"Because it\u0027s my fault he was there. I\u0027d upset him...and he had this thing to prove. I told him where the Strigoi were, and I wasn\u0027t supposed to. If he hadn\u0027t known about them, he wouldn\u0027t have done it. He\u0027d still be alive.\"\n \"You don\u0027t think he was responsible for his own actions? That he was the one who chose to do that?\"\n \"Well... yeah. I guess he did. I didn\u0027t make him do it.\"\n \"Any other reason you might feel guilty?\"\n I looked away from her and focused on a picture of a ladybug. \"He liked me - like romantically. We kind of dated, but I couldn\u0027t get into it. That hurt him.\"\n \"Why couldn\u0027t you get into it?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" I said. The image of his body, lying on the floor, flashed into my mind and I shoved it away. No way would I cry in front of Deirdre. \"That\u0027s the thing. I should have. He was nice. He was funny. We got along really well ... but it just didn\u0027t feel right. Even kissing or anything like that... I eventually just couldn\u0027t do it.\"\n \"Do you feel like you have a problem with intimate contact?\"\n \"What do you - ? Oh. No! Of course not.\"\n \"Have you ever had sex with anyone?\"\n \"No. Are you saying I should have?\"\n \"Do you think you should have?\"\n Damn. I\u0027d thought I had her. I\u0027d thought for sure she wouldn\u0027t have a question for that one. \"Mason wasn\u0027t the right person.\"\n \"Is there someone else? Someone you think might be the right person?\"\n I hesitated. I\u0027d lost track of how this related to me seeing ghosts. According to some paperwork I\u0027d signed, everything we said in here was confidential. She couldn\u0027t tell anyone unless I was a danger to myself or doing something illegal. I wasn\u0027t entirely sure where a relationship with an older man fell there.\n \"Yeah...but I can\u0027t tell you who he is.\"\n \"How long have you known him?\"\n \"Almost six months.\"\n \"Do you feel close?\"\n \"Yeah, sure. But we\u0027re not...\" How exactly did one describe this? \"We\u0027re not actually really involved. He\u0027s kind of ... unavailable.\" She could think what she wanted about that, like that maybe I was interested in a guy with a girlfriend.\n \"Is he the reason you couldn\u0027t get close to Mason?\"\n \"Yes.\"\n \"And is he holding you back from dating someone else?\"\n \"Well... he\u0027s not like purposely doing anything.\"\n \"But as long as you care about him, you\u0027re not interested in anyone else?\"\n \"Right. But it doesn\u0027t matter. I probably shouldn\u0027t even be dating anyone at all.\"\n \"Why not?\"\n \"Because there\u0027s no time. I\u0027m training to be a guardian. I have to give all my attention to Lissa.\"\n \"And you don\u0027t think you can do that and be romantically involved with someone?\"\n I shook my head. \"No. I have to be willing to lay down my life for hers. I can\u0027t be distracted by someone else. We have this saying with the guardians: \u0027They come first.\u0027 You guys. Moroi.\"\n \"And so you figure you\u0027ll always have to put Lissa\u0027s needs ahead of yours?\"\n \"Of course.\" I frowned. \"What else would I do? I\u0027m going to be her guardian.\"\n \"How does that make you feel? Giving up what you want for her?\"\n \"She\u0027s my best friend. And she\u0027s the last of her family.\"\n \"That\u0027s not what I asked.\"\n \"Yeah, but - \" I stopped. \"Hey, you didn\u0027t ask a question.\"\n \"You think I always ask questions?\"\n \"Never mind. Look, I love Lissa. I\u0027m happy to spend my life protecting her. End of story. Besides, are you, a Moroi, going to tell me, a dhampir, that I shouldn\u0027t be putting Moroi first? You know how the system works.\"\n \"I do,\" she said. \"But I\u0027m not here to analyze it. I\u0027m here to help you get better.\"\n \"Seems like you might not be able to do one without the other.\"\n Deirdre\u0027s lips quirked into a smile, and then her eyes flicked to the clock. \"We\u0027re out of time today. We\u0027ll have to pick this up next time.\"\n I crossed my arms over my chest. \"I thought you\u0027d be giving me some kind of awesome advice or telling me what to do. But you just kept making me talk.\"\n She laughed softly. \"Therapy isn\u0027t so much about what I think as you do.\"\n \"Then why do it at all?\"\n \"Because we don\u0027t always know what it is we\u0027re thinking or feeling. When you have a guide, it\u0027s easier to figure things out. You\u0027ll often discover that you already know what to do. I can help you ask questions and go places you might not have on your own.\"\n \"Well, you\u0027re good at the question part,\" I noted dryly.\n \"While I don\u0027t have any \u0027awesome advice,\u0027 I do have some things I want you to think about for when we talk again.\" She glanced down at her notepad and tapped it with her pencil while she thought. \"First, I want you to think again about what I asked about Lissa - how you really feel about dedicating your life to her.\"\n \"I already told you.\"\n \"I know. Just think about it some more. If your answer\u0027s the same, that\u0027s fine. Then, I want you to consider something else. I want you to think about whether maybe the reason you\u0027re attracted to this unavailable guy is because he\u0027s unavailable.\"\n \"That\u0027s crazy. That doesn\u0027t make any sense.\"\n \"Is it? You just told me that you can\u0027t ever be involved with anyone. Do you think it\u0027s possible that wanting someone you can\u0027t have is your subconscious mind\u0027s way of coping? If it\u0027s impossible for you to have him, then you never have to confront feeling conflicted about Lissa. You\u0027ll never have to choose.\"\n \"This is confusing,\" I grumbled.\n \"It\u0027s supposed to be. That\u0027s why I\u0027m here.\"\n \"What\u0027s this have to do with Mason?\"\n \"It has to do with you, Rose. That\u0027s what\u0027s important.\"\n I left therapy feeling like my brain had melted. I also kind of felt like I\u0027d been on trial. If Deirdre had been there to grill Victor, they probably would have finished up in half the time.\n I also thought Deirdre had totally been going in the wrong direction. Of course I didn\u0027t resent Lissa. And the thought that I\u0027d fallen for Dimitri because I couldn\u0027t have him was ridiculous. I\u0027d never even thought of the conflict with guarding until he\u0027d mentioned it. I\u0027d fallen for him because ... well, because he was Dimitri. Because he was sweet, strong, funny, fierce, and gorgeous. Because he understood me.\n And yet, as I walked back to the commons, I found her question spinning around in my brain. I might not have been thinking about a relationship distracting us in our guard duties, but I\u0027d certainly known from the start that his age and job were huge barriers. Could that have really played a part? Had some piece of me known we could never really have anything - thus allowing me to always stay dedicated to Lissa?\n No, I decided firmly. That was ridiculous. Deirdre might be good at asking questions, but she was clearly asking the wrong ones.\n \"Rose!\"\n I looked to my right and saw Adrian cutting across the lawn toward me, oblivious to the slush\u0027s effects on his designer shoes.\n \"Did you just call me \u0027Rose\u0027?\" I asked. \"And not \u0027little dhampir\u0027? I don\u0027t think that\u0027s ever happened.\"\n \"It happens all the time,\" he countered, catching up to me.\n We stepped inside the commons. School was in session, so the halls were empty.\n \"Where\u0027s your better half?\" he asked.\n \"Christian?\"\n \"No, Lissa. You can tell where she is, right?\"\n \"Yeah, I can tell because it\u0027s last period, and she\u0027s in class like everyone else. You keep forgetting that for the rest of us, this is a school.\"\n He looked disappointed. \"I found more case files I wanted to talk to her about. More super-compulsion stuff.\"\n \"Whoa, you\u0027ve been doing something productive? I\u0027m impressed.\"\n \"You\u0027re one to talk,\" he said. \"Especially considering your whole existence here revolves around beating people up. You dhampirs are uncivilized - but then, that\u0027s why we love you.\"\n \"Actually,\" I mused, \"we aren\u0027t the only ones doing beatings lately.\" I\u0027d nearly forgotten about my royal fight club mystery. There were so many things I had to worry about lately. It was like trying to hold water in my hands. It was a long shot, but I had to ask him. \"Does the word Man? mean anything to you?\"\n He leaned against the wall and reached for his cigarettes. \"Sure.\"\n \"You\u0027re inside the school,\" I warned.\n \"What - oh, right.\" With a sigh, he put the pack back in his coat. \"Don\u0027t half of you study Romanian here? It means \u0027hand.\u0027\"\n \"I study English here.\" Hand. That didn\u0027t make any sense.\n \"Why the interest in translation?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know. I think I got it wrong. I thought it had some connection to this thing that\u0027s been going on with these royals.\"\n Recognition flashed in his eyes. \"Oh Lord. Not that. Are they really doing it here too?\"\n \"Doing what?\"\n \"The Man?. The Hand. It\u0027s this stupid secret society that pops up at schools. We had a chapter of it back at Alder. It\u0027s mostly a bunch of royals getting together and having secret meetings to talk about how much better they are than everyone else.\"\n \"That\u0027s it then,\" I said. The pieces clicked together. \"That\u0027s Jesse and Ralf\u0027s little group - the one they tried to get Christian to join. That\u0027s what this Man? is.\"\n \"Him?\" Adrian laughed. \"They must have been desperate - and I don\u0027t mean that as a slam against Christian. He\u0027s just not really the type to get into that kind of thing.\"\n \"Yeah, well, he turned them down pretty hard. What\u0027s the point of this secret society exactly?\"\n He shrugged. \"The same as any other. It\u0027s a way to make people feel better about themselves. Everyone likes feeling special. Being part of an elite group is a way to do that.\"\n \"But you weren\u0027t part of it?\"\n \"No need. I already know I\u0027m special.\"\n \"Jesse and Ralf made it sound like royals had to stick together because of all the controversies that are going on - about fighting and guardians and all that. They made it sound like they could do something about it.\"\n \"Not at this age,\" said Adrian. \"Mostly all they can do is talk. When they get older, Man? members sometimes cut deals for each other and still have secret meetings.\"\n \"That\u0027s it then? They\u0027re just hanging out and talking to hear themselves talk?\"\n He turned contemplative. \"Well, yes, of course they\u0027re doing lots of that. But I mean, whenever these little chapters form, there\u0027s usually something specific they want to do in secret. Each group\u0027s kind of different that way, so this one\u0027s probably got some plan or scheme or whatever.\" A plan or scheme. I didn\u0027t like the sound of that. Especially with Jesse and Ralf.\n \"You know a lot for someone who wasn\u0027t in it.\"\n \"My dad was. He never talks much about it - hence the secret part - but I picked up things, and then I heard about it while I was at school.\"\n I leaned against the wall. The clock across the hall told me classes were almost over. \"Did you hear anything about them beating up people? There are at least four Moroi I know of who were attacked. And they won\u0027t talk about it.\"\n \"Who? Like non-royals?\"\n \"No. Other royals.\"\n \"That doesn\u0027t make any sense. The whole point of it is for elite royals to band together to protect themselves from change. Unless, perhaps, they\u0027re going after royals who refuse or are supporting non-royals.\"\n \"Maybe. But one of them was Jesse\u0027s brother, and Jesse seems to be a founding member. Seems like he\u0027d have to make the cut. And they didn\u0027t do anything when Christian refused.\"\n Adrian spread his hands wide. \"Even I don\u0027t know everything, and like I said, this one\u0027s probably got its own little agenda they\u0027re keeping hidden.\" I sighed in frustration, and he gave me a curious look. \"Why do you care so much?\"\n \"Because it isn\u0027t right. The people I saw were in bad shape. If some group\u0027s going around and ganging up on victims, they need to be stopped,\"\n Adrian laughed and played with a strand of my hair. \"You can\u0027t save everyone, though God knows you try.\"\n \"I just want to do what\u0027s right.\" I remembered Dimitri\u0027s comments about Westerns and couldn\u0027t help a small smile. \"I need to bring justice where it\u0027s needed.\"\n \"The crazy thing, little dhampir, is that you mean that. I can tell by your aura.\"\n \"What, are you saying it\u0027s not black anymore?\"\n \"No...still dark, definitely. But it\u0027s got a little light in it, streaks of gold. Like sunlight.\"\n \"Maybe your theory about me catching it from Lissa is wrong then.\" I\u0027d been trying very hard not to think about last night, when I\u0027d learned about Anna. Mentioning it now stirred up all those fears all over again. Insanity. Suicide.\n \"Depends,\" he said. \"When was the last time you saw her?\"\n I gave him a light punch. \"You have no clue, do you? You\u0027re making this up as you go along.\"\n He caught my wrist and pulled me closer. \"Isn\u0027t that the way you normally operate?\"\n I grinned in spite of myself. This close to him I could appreciate just how lovely the green of his eyes was. In fact, despite continually making fun of him, I couldn\u0027t deny that the rest of him was pretty good-looking too. His fingers were warm on my wrist, and there was something kind of sexy about the way he held it. Thinking back to Deirdre\u0027s words, I tried to assess how it all made me feel. The queen\u0027s warnings aside, Adrian was a guy who was technically available. Was I attracted to him? Did I get a thrill out of this?\n The answer: no. Not in the same way I did with Dimitri. Adrian was sexy in his way, but he didn\u0027t drive me wild the way Dimitri did. Was it because Adrian was so readily available? Was Deirdre right about me purposely wanting relationships that were impossible?\n \"You know,\" he said, interrupting my thoughts, \"under any other circumstances, this would be hot. Instead, you\u0027re looking at me like I\u0027m some kind of science fair project.\"\n That was exactly how I was treating this, actually. \"Why don\u0027t you ever use compulsion on me?\" I asked. \"And I don\u0027t mean just to stop me from getting in fights.\"\n \"Because half the fun of you is that you\u0027re so difficult.\"\n A new idea occurred to me. \"Do it.\"\n \"Do what?\"\n \"Use compulsion on me.\"\n \"What?\" It was another of those rare shocked Adrian moments.\n \"Use compulsion to make me want to kiss you - except you have to promise not to actually kiss me.\"\n \"That\u0027s pretty weird - and when I say something\u0027s weird, you know it\u0027s serious.\"\n \"Please.\"\n He sighed and then focused his eyes right on me. It was like drowning, drowning in seas of green. There was nothing in the world except for those eyes.\n \"I want to kiss you, Rose,\" he said softly. \"And I want you to want me too.\"\n Every aspect of his body - his lips, his hands, his scent - suddenly overpowered me. I felt warm all over. I wanted him to kiss me with every ounce of my being. There was nothing in life I wanted more than that kiss. I tilted my face up toward his, and he leaned down. I could practically taste his lips.\n \"Do you want to?\" he asked, voice still like velvet. \"Do you want to kiss me?\"\n Did I ever. Everything around me had blurred. Only his lips were in focus.\n \"Yes,\" I said. His face moved closer, his mouth only a breath away from mine. We were so, so close, and then -\n He stopped. \"We\u0027re done,\" he said, stepping back.\n I snapped out of it instantly. The dreamy haze was gone, as was the yearning in my body. But I\u0027d discovered something. Under compulsion, I had definitely wanted him to kiss me. Yet even under compulsion, it hadn\u0027t been the electric, all-encompassing feeling I had when I was with Dimitri, that feeling that we were practically the same person and were bound by forces bigger than both of us. With Adrian, it had simply been mechanical.\n Deirdre had been wrong. If my attraction to Dimitri was just some subconscious reaction, then it should have been as superficial as that forced attraction to Adrian. Yet they were completely different. With Dimitri, it was love - not just some trick my mind was playing on me.\n \"Hmm,\" I said.\n \"Hmm?\" asked Adrian, eyeing me with amusement.\n \"Hmm.\"\n The third \"hmm\" hadn\u0027t come from either of us. I looked across the hall and saw Christian watching us. I separated from Adrian, just as the bell rang. The sounds of students pouring out of classrooms rumbled through the hallway.\n \"Now I can see Lissa,\" said Adrian happily.\n \"Rose, will you come with me to the feeders?\" asked Christian. He spoke in a flat tone, and his expression was unreadable.\n \"I\u0027m not guarding you today.\"\n \"Yeah, well, I miss your charming company.\"\n I told Adrian goodbye and cut through the cafeteria with Christian. \"What\u0027s up?\" I asked.\n \"You tell me,\" he said. \"You were the one about ready to start making out with Adrian.\"\n \"It was an experiment,\" I said. \"It was part of my therapy.\"\n \"What the hell kind of therapy are you in?\"\n We reached the feeders\u0027 room. Somehow, despite him getting out of class early, there were still a few people ahead of us in line.\n \"Why do you care?\" I asked him. \"You should be happy. It means he isn\u0027t moving in on Lissa.\"\n \"He could be moving in on both of you.\"\n \"What are you, my big brother now?\"\n \"Annoyed,\" he said. \"That\u0027s what I am.\"\n I looked beyond him and saw Jesse and Ralf enter. \"Well, keep it to yourself, or our good friends will overhear.\"\n Jesse, however, was too busy to hear, because he was arguing with the feeding coordinator. \"I don\u0027t have time to wait,\" he told her. \"I\u0027ve got to be somewhere.\"\n She pointed to us and the others in line. \"These people are ahead of you.\"\n Jesse met her eyes and smiled. \"You can make an exception this time.\"\n \"Yeah, he\u0027s in a hurry,\" added Ralf in a voice I\u0027d never heard him use before. It was smooth and less grating than usual. \"Just write his name down at the top of the list.\"\n The coordinator looked like she was going to tell them off, but then a funny, distracted look came over her face. She glanced at her clipboard and wrote something. A few seconds after she looked away, her head jerked up again, eyes sharp once more. She frowned.\n \"What was I doing?\"\n \"You were signing me up,\" said Jesse. He pointed at the board. \"See?\"\n She looked down, startled. \"Why is your name first? Didn\u0027t you just get here?\"\n \"We were here earlier and checked in. You told us it was okay.\"\n She looked down again, clearly puzzled. She didn\u0027t remember them coming earlier - because they hadn\u0027t - but she apparently couldn\u0027t figure out why Jesse\u0027s name was at the top now. A moment later, she shrugged and must have decided it wasn\u0027t worth overthinking. \"Stand with the others, and I\u0027ll call you next.\"\n As soon as Jesse and Ralf came near us, I turned on them. \"You just used compulsion on her,\" I hissed.\n Jesse looked panicked for a fraction of a second; then his normal swagger took over. \"Whatever. I just convinced her, that\u0027s all. What, are you going to try to tell on me or something?\"\n \"Nothing to tell,\" scoffed Christian. \"That was the worst compulsion I\u0027ve ever seen.\"\n \"Like you\u0027ve seen compulsion,\" said Ralf.\n \"Plenty,\" said Christian. \"From people prettier than you. Of course, maybe that\u0027s part of why yours isn\u0027t as good.\"\n Ralf seemed highly offended at not being considered pretty, but Jesse just nudged him and started to turn away. \"Forget him. He had his chance.\"\n \"His chance at - \" I remembered how Brandon had attempted weak compulsion when trying to convince me his bruises were nothing. Jill had said that Brett Ozera actually had convinced a teacher that his were nothing. The teacher had dropped the matter, much to Jill\u0027s surprise. Brett must have used compulsion. Lightbulbs went off in different parts of my brain. The connections were all around me. The problem was, I couldn\u0027t untangle the wires quite yet. \"That\u0027s what this is about, isn\u0027t it? Your stupid Man? and its need to beat up on people. It\u0027s got something to do with compulsion....\"\n I didn\u0027t understand how it all fit together, but the surprised look on Jesse\u0027s face told me I was on to something, even though he said, \"You don\u0027t know what you\u0027re talking about.\"\n I pushed forward, hoping some blind hits would make him mad and say something he wasn\u0027t supposed to. \"What\u0027s the point? Does it give you guys some kind of power trip to do these little tricks? That\u0027s all they are, you know. You seriously don\u0027t know the first thing about compulsion. I\u0027ve seen compulsion that would make you do handstands and throw yourself out a window.\"\n \"We\u0027re learning more than you can even imagine,\" said Jesse. \"And when I find out who told - \"\n He didn\u0027t get a chance to finish his threat because he was called over to the feeder just then. He and Ralf stalked away, and Christian immediately turned to me.\n \"What\u0027s going on? What\u0027s a Man??\"\n I gave him a hasty recap of Adrian\u0027s explanation. \"That\u0027s what they wanted you to join. They must secretly be practicing compulsion. Adrian said these groups are always royals who have some plan to change and control things in dangerous times. They must think compulsion is the answer - it\u0027s what they meant when they told you they had ways to help you get what you wanted. If they knew how crappy your compulsion was, they probably wouldn\u0027t have asked.\"\n He scowled, not liking me reminding him of the one time he\u0027d attempted - and failed - to compel someone at the ski lodge. \"So where\u0027s the beating-people-up part come in?\"\n \"That\u0027s the mystery,\" I said. Christian was summoned over to feed just then, and I put my theories on hold until I could get more info and take action. I noticed which feeder we were being led to. \"Is that Alice again? How do you always get her? Do you request her?\"\n \"No, but I think some people specifically un-request her.\"\n Alice was happy to see us, as always. \"Rose. Are you still keeping us safe?\"\n \"I will if they\u0027ll let me,\" I told her.\n \"Don\u0027t be too hasty,\" she warned. \"Conserve your strength. If you\u0027re too eager to fight the undead, you may find yourselves joining them. Then you\u0027d never see us again, and we\u0027d be very sad.\"\n \"Yes,\" said Christian. \"I\u0027d cry into my pillow every night.\"\n I resisted the urge to kick him. \"Well, I couldn\u0027t visit if I was Strigoi, yeah, but hopefully I\u0027d just die a normal death. Then I could come see you as a ghost.\"\n How sad, I thought, that I was now making jokes about the very thing that was freaking me out lately. Alice found no amusement in it whatsoever. She shook her head.\n \"No, you wouldn\u0027t. The wards would keep you out.\"\n \"The wards only keep Strigoi out,\" I reminded her gently.\n A defiant look replaced her scattered one. \"The wards keep anything that isn\u0027t alive out. Dead or undead.\"\n \"Now you\u0027ve done it,\" said Christian.\n \"The wards don\u0027t keep ghosts out,\" I said. \"I\u0027ve seen them.\"\n Considering Alice\u0027s own instability, I didn\u0027t mind discussing mine with her. In fact, it was kind of refreshing to talk about this stuff with someone who wouldn\u0027t judge me. Indeed, she treated this as a perfectly normal conversation. \"If you\u0027ve seen ghosts, then we\u0027re not safe anymore.\"\n \"I told you last time, the security\u0027s too good.\"\n \"Maybe someone made a mistake,\" she argued, sounding remarkably coherent. \"Maybe someone missed something. Wards are made of magic. Magic is alive. Ghosts can\u0027t cross them for the same reason as Strigoi. They aren\u0027t alive. If you saw a ghost, the wards have failed.\" She paused. \"Or you\u0027re crazy.\"\n Christian laughed out loud. \"There you go, Rose. Straight from the source.\" I shot him a glare. He smiled at Alice. \"In Rose\u0027s defense, though, I think she\u0027s right about the wards. The school checks them all the time. The only place guarded better than here is the Royal Court, and both places are overflowing with guardians. Stop being so paranoid.\" He fed, and I glanced away. I should have known better than to listen to Alice. She was hardly a reputable source of information, even if she\u0027d been around for a while. And yet... her weird logic did make sense. If wards kept Strigoi out, why not ghosts? True, Strigoi were the dead who had come back to walk the earth, but her point was sound: All of them were dead. But Christian and I were right too: The wards around the school were solid. It took a lot of power to lay wards. Not every Moroi home could have them, but places like schools and the Royal Court had theirs maintained diligently. The Royal Court...\n I\u0027d had no ghostly encounters whatsoever while we there, yet that had been incredibly stressful. If my sightings were stress-induced, wouldn\u0027t the Court and encounters with Victor and the queen have provided great opportunities for them to occur? The fact that I\u0027d seen nothing seemed to negate the PTSD theory. I hadn\u0027t seen ghosts until we\u0027d landed at the Martinville airport.\n Which didn\u0027t have wards.\n I nearly gasped. The Court had strong wards. I\u0027d seen no ghosts. The airport, which was part of the human world, had no wards. I\u0027d been bombarded with ghosts there. I\u0027d also seen flashes of them on the plane - which was unwarded when we were in the air.\n I looked over at Alice and Christian. They were just about finished. Could she be right? Did wards keep out ghosts? And if so, what was going on with the school? If the wards were intact, I should see nothing - just like at Court. If the wards were broken, I should be overrun - just like at the airport. Instead, the Academy was somewhere in the middle. I had sightings only occasionally. It didn\u0027t make sense.\n The only thing I knew for sure was that if something was wrong with the school\u0027s wards, then I wasn\u0027t the only one in danger. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/shadow-kiss-vampire-academy-3/page-20.html","bookId":2062,"book":{"id":2062,"title":"Shadow Kiss (Vampire Academy #3)","description":"Storyline: \n Vampire Academy Series 3: Shadow Kiss \n A little background... I am in my mid 20\u0027s and a high school teacher who loves to read when I can but doesn\u0027t get much time to do it in. I picked up the twilight series a year ago at a students request and was pleasantly surprised. Once the series was finished I needed another one! Before Twilight I had not been into teen romance/ fantasy books especially with vampires and such. I saw a book-list of recommendations by Twilight followers and picked up the \"House of Night\" series by PC Cast. This was worth reading and I am waiting for the next book to come. My husband now calls me addicted to Vamps since I started looking for a new series to pick up. I was strongly recommended to pick up the Vampire Academy series by my 20 year old sister who has always been a fan of this genre of books.\n \n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/shadow-kiss-vampire-academy-3.jpg","author":"Richelle Mead","type":"Fantasy","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/shadow-kiss-vampire-academy-3.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:18 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:03:18 AM"}}
