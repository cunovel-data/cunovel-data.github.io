It was a veritable army, and much as with the Strigoi, the numbers were unprecedented, aside from old European legends of great epic battles between our races. We had more guardians on campus, but some had to stay behind to protect the school. A lot of my classmates had been drafted for that duty, but about ten or so (including me) were accompanying the others to the cave.\\n\\n An hour before departure, we met again to go over the plan. There was a large chamber near the far side of the cave, and it made the most sense for the Strigoi to be there so they could head out right away once night came. We were going to attack from both ends. Fifteen guardians would go in from each side, accompanied by three Moroi each. Ten guardians would remain at each entrance to hold back any escaping Strigoi. I was assigned to watch the entrance on the far side. Dimitri and my mother were part of the groups actually going inside. I wished desperately that I could have been with them, but I knew I was lucky to be along at all. And on a mission like this, every job was important.\\n\\n Our little army set out, moving at a brisk pace to cover the five miles. We figured that it would take a little over an hour, and there would still be enough daylight for the fight and return trip. No Strigoi would be stationed outside on guard duty, so we could reach the caves undetected. Once our people were inside, however, it was almost a given that the Strigoi\u0027s superior hearing would immediately alert them to the attack.\\n\\n There was little conversation as we approached. No one felt like chatting, and most talk was of a logistical nature. I walked with the novices, but every once in a while, I\u0027d glance over and meet Dimitri\u0027s eyes. I felt like there was an invisible bond between us now, so thick and intense that it was a wonder everyone couldn\u0027t see it. His face was battle-serious, but I saw the smile in his eyes.\\n\\n Our group split when we reached the closest entrance to the cave. Dimitri and my mother were going in here, and as I gave them one last glance, my feelings had little to do with my earlier romantic interlude. Everything I felt was worry, worry I\u0027d never see them again. I had to remind myself that they were tough - two of the best guardians out there. If anyone would come out of this, it was them. I was the one who needed to be careful, and as we walked the half-mile around the mountain\u0027s base, I carefully placed my emotions in a small compartment in the back of my mind. They\u0027d have to stay there until this was over. I was in battle mode now and couldn\u0027t let my feelings distract me.\\n\\n When we were almost to our entrance, I caught a silvery flash out of the corner of my eye. I\u0027d been keeping the assorted ghostly images that lived outside of the wards away, but this was one I wanted to see. Glancing over, I saw Mason. He stood there, saying nothing, wearing his perpetually sad expression. He still seemed unusually pale to me. As our group passed by, he held up one hand, as a farewell or benediction, I didn\u0027t know.\\n\\n At the cave\u0027s entrance, our group split up. Alberta and Stan were leading the group in. They stood poised at the entrance, waiting for the exact time they\u0027d agreed upon with the other group. Ms. Carmack, my magic teacher, was among the Moroi going in with them. She looked nervous but determined.\\n\\n The moment came, and the adults disappeared. The rest of us stood there, lined up in a ring around the cave. Gray clouds hung in the sky. The sun had begun its descent, but we still had awhile.\\n\\n \"This is going to be easy,\" murmured Meredith, one of three other girls in the senior class. She spoke uncertainly, more to herself than to me, I think. \"A slam dunk. They\u0027ll take out the Strigoi before any of them realize it. We won\u0027t have to do anything.\"\\n\\n I hoped she was right. I was ready to fight, but if I didn\u0027t have to, it\u0027d mean everything had gone as planned.\\n\\n We waited. There was nothing else to do. Every minute felt like an eternity. Then we heard it: the sounds of fighting. Muffled cries and grunts. A few screams. All of us tensed, bodies so rigid we nearly snapped. Emil was our leader on this, and he stood closest to entrance, stake in hand and sweat forming on his brow as he peered into the darkness, ready for any sign of a Strigoi.\\n\\n A few minutes into it, we heard the sound of footsteps running toward us. Our stakes were ready. Emil and another guardian drew closer to the entrance, ready to jump in and kill the fleeing Strigoi.\\n\\n But it wasn\u0027t a Strigoi who came out. It was Abby Badica. She was scraped up and dirty, but otherwise, she was alive. Her face was frantic and streaked with tears. At first, she screamed when she saw all of us. Then she realized who we were and collapsed into the arms of the first person she could get to - Meredith.\\n\\n Meredith looked surprised, but she gave Abby a hug of reassurance. \"It\u0027s okay,\" Meredith said. \"Everything\u0027s okay. You\u0027re in the sun.\"\\n\\n Gently, Meredith unwrapped Abby and led her to a nearby tree. Abby sat at its base, burying her face in her hands. Meredith returned to her position. I wanted to comfort Abby. I think we all did, but it would have to wait.\\n\\n A minute later, another Moroi came out. It was Mr. Ellsworth, the teacher I\u0027d had in fifth grade. He too looked worn, and his neck showed puncture marks. The Strigoi had used him for feeding but hadn\u0027t killed him yet. Nonetheless, despite what horrors he must have faced, Mr. Ellsworth was calm, his eyes alert and watchful. He recognized the situation and immediately stepped out of our circle.\\n\\n \"What\u0027s going on in there?\" asked Emil, his eyes on the cave. Some of the guardians had earpieces, but I imagined in the midst of battle, it was hard to report back.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a mess,\" said Mr. Ellsworth. \"But we\u0027re getting away - in both directions. It\u0027s hard to tell who\u0027s fighting who, but the Strigoi are distracted. And someone...\" He frowned. \"I saw someone using fire on the Strigoi.\"\\n\\n None of us answered. It was too complex to get into right now. He seemed to realize that and withdrew to sit near a still-sobbing Abby.\\n\\n Two more Moroi and a dhampir I didn\u0027t know soon joined Abby and Mr. Ellsworth. Each time someone came out, I prayed that it would be Eddie. We had five victims so far, and I had to assume that others were escaping at the entrance closest to the school.\\n\\n Several minutes passed, though, and no one else came out. My shirt was drenched, soaked through with sweat. I had to shift my hold on the stake every once in a while. My grip was so tight that my fingers were locking up. Suddenly, I saw Emil flinch. I realized he was getting a message through his earpiece. His face showed intense concentration, and then he murmured something back. Looking up at us, he pointed at three novices.\\n\\n \"You - take them back to the school.\" He gestured at the refugees, and then turned toward three of the adult guardians. \"Go in. Most of the prisoners have gotten out, but our people are trapped. There\u0027s a stalemate.\" The guardians moved in without hesitation, and a few moments later, the novices and their charges took off.\\n\\n That left four of us, two adults - Emil and Stephen - and two novices, me and Shane. The tension around us was so thick, we could barely breathe. No one else was coming out. No more reports were being made. Emil glanced up and looked alarmed. I followed his gaze. More time had passed than I realized. The sun was significantly lower. Emil suddenly flinched again as another message came through.\\n\\n He looked at all of us, his face troubled. \"We need more in there to cover the escape on the other end. It doesn\u0027t sound like we\u0027ve lost many. They\u0027re just still having trouble with the retreat.\"\\n\\n Many, he\u0027d said. Not any. That meant we\u0027d lost at least one person. I felt cold all over.\\n\\n \"Stephen, you go in,\" said Emil. He hesitated, and I could read his dilemma like a book. He wanted to go in too, but as the leader for this side, he was supposed to stay stationed here until the last possible moment. He was on the verge of disobeying those orders, I realized. He was considering going in with Stephen and leaving Shane and me out here. Yet, at the same time, he couldn\u0027t bring himself to leave two novices here alone, should something unexpected happen. Emil exhaled, and he looked us over. \"Rose, go with him.\"\\n\\n I didn\u0027t waste a moment. Following Stephen, I slipped into the cave, and immediately, that nauseous feeling rolled over me. It had been cold outside, but it was colder still as we moved deeper. It was also darker. Our eyes could handle a fair amount of it, but it soon became too much. He flipped on a small light attached to his jacket.\\n\\n \"I wish I could tell you what to do, but I don\u0027t know what we\u0027ll find,\" he told me. \"Be ready for anything.\"\\n\\n The darkness in front of us began to fade. The sounds grew louder. We picked up the pace, glancing in all directions. Suddenly, we found ourselves in the large chamber shown on the map. A fire burned in one corner - one the Strigoi had made, not anything magical - that was providing the light. Looking around, I immediately saw what had happened.\\n\\n Part of the wall had fallen in, creating a pile of stones. No one had been crushed under it, but it had almost entirely blocked the opening to the other side of the cave. I didn\u0027t know if magic had caused it, or if the fighting had. Maybe it had been a coincidence. Whatever the reason, seven guardians - including Dimitri and Alberta - were trapped now by ten Strigoi. No Moroi fire users had been caught on this side, but the flashes of light coming through the opening in the cave-in showed me that they were still fighting on the other side. I saw bodies lying on the floor. Two were Strigoi, but I couldn\u0027t make out the others.\\n\\n The problem was obvious. Getting through the opening would require someone practically crawling. It would put the person in a vulnerable position. This meant these Strigoi needed to be taken out before the guardians could make their escape. Stephen and I were going to help even the odds. We came up from behind the Strigoi, but three of them sensed us somehow and turned toward us. Two jumped Stephen, and the other came at me.\\n\\n Instantly, I kicked into battle mode. All the rage and frustration poured out through me. The cave made for close fighting quarters, but I was still able to evade him. In fact, the close space was to my advantage because the Strigoi, with his larger size, had trouble ducking and dodging. I stayed out of his reach mostly, though he did grab hold of me long enough to slam me against the wall. I didn\u0027t even feel it. I just kept moving, going on the offensive. I eluded his next attack, got in some blows of my own, and, with my small size, managed to slip down and stake him before his next hit. I pulled out the blade in one smooth motion and went to help Stephen. He\u0027d taken out one of his attackers, and between us, we finished the last one.\\n\\n That left seven Strigoi now. No, six. The trapped guardians - who were having difficulty in their pinned position - had killed another. Stephen and I jerked the Strigoi closest to us out of the circle. He was a strong one - very old, very powerful - and even with the two of us, he was hard to take down. At last, we did. With the Strigoi numbers reduced, the other guardians were having an easier time getting to the rest. They started freeing themselves from their trapped position, and their numbers alone were now an aid.\\n\\n When the Strigoi count was down to two, Alberta yelled at us to start escaping. Our alignment in the room had changed. We were now the ones surrounding the last two Strigoi. This left the path clear for three of the guardians to escape via the way I\u0027d come in. Stephen, meanwhile, crawled through the hole to the other side. Dimitri staked one of the two Strigoi. One left. Stephen stuck his head back in and shouted something to Alberta that I couldn\u0027t quite make out. She yelled something back without looking at him. She, Dimitri, and two others were closing in on the last Strigoi.\\n\\n \"Rose,\" yelled Stephen, beckoning.\\n\\n Follow orders. That\u0027s what we did. I left the fray, scrambling through the hole more easily than he had, thanks to my smaller size. Another guardian immediately followed after me. No one was on this side of cave-in. The fight had either ended or moved on. Bodies showed that things had been intense, however. I saw more Strigoi, as well as a familiar face: Yuri. I hastily looked away toward Stephen, who was helping another guardian through. Alberta came next.\\n\\n \"They\u0027re dead,\" she called. \"It sounds like there are a few more blocking the retreat down here. Let\u0027s finish this before the sun comes up.\"\\n\\n Dimitri came last of all through the gap. He and I exchanged brief, relieved glances, and then we were on the move. This was the long part of the tunnel, and we hurried down it, anxious to get our remaining people out. At first, we encountered nothing, and then flashes of light indicated a fight up ahead. Ms. Carmack and my mother were fighting three Strigoi. My group closed in, and in seconds, the Strigoi were down.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s it for this group,\" my mother gasped out. I was grateful to see her alive too. \"But I think there are more here than we thought. I think they left some behind when they went to attack the school. The rest of our people - that survived - have already made it out.\"\\n\\n \"There are other branches in the cave,\" said Alberta. \"Strigoi could be hiding in there.\"\\n\\n My mother agreed. \"They could be. Some know they\u0027re overwhelmed and are just going to wait us out and escape later. Others may come after us.\"\\n\\n \"What do we do?\" asked Stephen. \"Finish them off? Or retreat?\"\\n\\n We turned to Alberta. She made a quick decision. \"We retreat. We got as many as we could, and the sun is dropping. We need to get back behind the wards.\"\\n\\n We took off, so close to victory, fueled by the disappearing light. Dimitri was beside me as we moved. \"Did Eddie get out?\" I hadn\u0027t seen his body, but I hadn\u0027t been paying much attention either.\\n\\n \"Yes,\" said Dimitri, breathing ragged. God only knew how many Strigoi he\u0027d fought today. \"We had to practically force him out. He wanted to fight.\" That sounded like Eddie.\\n\\n \"I remember this curve,\" my mother said as we rounded a corner. \"It\u0027s not much farther. We should see light soon.\" Thus far, we were only guided by the jacket lights.\\n\\n I felt the nausea only a split second before they attacked. At a T intersection, seven Strigoi jumped us. They\u0027d let the earlier party escape, but they\u0027d been lying in wait for us, three on one side and four on the other. One guardian, Alan, never saw it coming. A Strigoi grabbed him and snapped Alan\u0027s neck so quickly that it looked effortless. It probably was. It was such a mirror to what had happened to Mason that I nearly came to a standstill. Instead, I doubled back, ready to get into the fray.\\n\\n But we were in a narrow part of the tunnel, and not all of us could get through to the Strigoi. I was stuck in the back. Ms. Carmack was beside me, and she had enough visibility to light up a couple of the Strigoi, making it easier for those guardians in the fight to stake them.\\n\\n Alberta caught a glimpse of me and a couple other guardians. \"Start retreating!\" she yelled.\\n\\n None of us wanted to leave, but there wasn\u0027t much we could do. I saw one guardian fall, and my heart lurched. I hadn\u0027t known him, but it didn\u0027t matter. In seconds my mother was on the Strigoi attacker, driving her stake through his heart.\\n\\n Then I lost sight of the fight as I rounded another corner with the three guardians with me. Farther down the corridor, I saw faint purplish light. The exit. Faces of other guardians peered in at us. We\u0027d made it. But where were the others?\\n\\n We ran to the exit, emerging into the air. My group clustered by the opening, anxious to see what had happened. The sun, I was dismayed to see, was nearly gone. The nausea hadn\u0027t left me, which meant Strigoi were still alive.\\n\\n Moments later, my mother\u0027s party came tearing down the hall. By the numbers, one more had gone down. But they were so close. Everyone around me tensed up. So close. So, so close.\\n\\n But not close enough. Three Strigoi lay in wait in one of the alcoves. We\u0027d passed them, but they\u0027d let us go by. It all happened so fast; no one could have reacted in time. One of the Strigoi grabbed Celeste, his mouth and fangs going for her cheek. I heard a strangled scream and saw blood everywhere. One of the Strigoi went for Ms. Carmack, but my mother jerked her away and shoved her forward toward us.\\n\\n The third Strigoi grabbed Dimitri. In all the time I\u0027d known him, I\u0027d never seen Dimitri falter. He was always faster, always stronger than everyone else. Not this time. This Strigoi had caught him by surprise, and that slight edge was all it had taken.\\n\\n I stared. It was the blond Strigoi. The one who had spoken to me in the battle.\\n\\n He grabbed Dimitri and pulled him to the ground. They grappled, strength against strength, and then I saw those fangs sink into Dimitri\u0027s neck. The red eyes flicked up and made contact with my own.\\n\\n I heard another scream - this time, it was my own.\\n\\n My mother started to double back toward the fallen, but then five more Strigoi appeared. It was chaos. I couldn\u0027t see Dimitri anymore; I couldn\u0027t see what had happened to him. Indecision flashed over my mother\u0027s features as she tried to decide to flee or fight, and then, regret all over her face, she kept running toward us and the exit. Meanwhile, I was trying to run back inside, but someone was stopping me. It was Stan.\\n\\n \"What are you doing, Rose? More are coming.\"\\n\\n Didn\u0027t he understand? Dimitri was in there. I had to get Dimitri.\\n\\n My mother and Alberta burst out, dragging Ms. Carmack. A group of Strigoi were after them, skidding to a halt just on the edge of the waning light. I was still fighting Stan. He didn\u0027t need the help, but my mother grasped a hold of me and tugged me away.\\n\\n \"Rose, we have to get out of here!\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s in there!\" I screamed, straining as hard as I could. How could I have killed Strigoi and not been able to break free from these two? \"Dimitri\u0027s in there! We have to go back for him! We can\u0027t leave him!\"\\n\\n I was rambling, hysterical, shouting at them all that we had to go rescue Dimitri. My mother shook me hard and leaned close so there were only a couple inches between us.\\n\\n \"He is dead, Rose! We can\u0027t go back in there. The sun will be down in fifteen minutes, and they are waiting for us. We\u0027re going to be in the dark before we can get back to the wards. We need every second we can get - it still may not be enough.\"\\n\\n I could see the Strigoi gathered at the entrance, their red eyes gleaming with anticipation. They completely filled the opening, ten I believed. Maybe more. My mother was right. With their speed, even our fifteen-minute lead might not be enough. And yet, I still couldn\u0027t take a step. I couldn\u0027t stop staring at the cave, back where Dimitri was, back where half of my soul was. He couldn\u0027t be dead. If he was, then surely I would be dead too.\\n\\n My mother slapped me, the pain snapping me out of my daze.\\n\\n \"Run!\" she yelled at me. \"He is dead! You are not going to join him!\"\\n\\n I saw the panic in her own face, panic over me - her daughter - getting killed. I remembered Dimitri saying he\u0027d rather die than see me dead. And if I stood there stupidly, letting the Strigoi get me, I\u0027d fail both of them.\\n\\n \"Run!\" she cried again.\\n\\n Tears streaming down my face, I ran. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/shadow-kiss-vampire-academy-3/page-27.html","bookId":2062,"book":{"id":2062,"title":"Shadow Kiss (Vampire Academy #3)","description":"Storyline: Vampire Academy Series 3: Shadow Kiss \\n A little background...
