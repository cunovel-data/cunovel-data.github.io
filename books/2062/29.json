{"id":110706,"no":29,"title":"Page 29","content":"Twenty-nine NEARLY A WEEK LATER, I showed up at Adrian\u0027s door. We hadn\u0027t had classes since the attack, but our normal curfew hours were still in effect, and it was almost bedtime. Adrian\u0027s face registered complete and total shock when he saw me. It was the first time I\u0027d ever sought him out, rather than vice versa. \"Little dhampir,\" he said, stepping aside. \"Come in.\" I did, and was nearly overwhelmed by the smell of alcohol as I passed him. The Academy\u0027s guest housing was nice, but he clearly hadn\u0027t done much to keep his suite clean. I had a feeling he\u0027d probably been drinking nonstop since the attack. The TV was on, and a small table by the couch held a half-empty bottle of vodka. I picked it up and read the label. It was in Russian. \"Bad time?\" I asked, setting it back down. \"Never a bad time for you,\" he told me gallantly. His face looked haggard. He was still as good-looking as ever, but there were dark circles under his eyes like he hadn\u0027t been sleeping well. He waved me toward an armchair and sat down on the couch. \"Haven\u0027t seen much of you.\" I leaned back. \"I haven\u0027t wanted to be seen,\" I admitted. I\u0027d hardly spoken to anyone since the attack. I\u0027d spent a lot of time by myself or with Lissa. I took comfort from being around her, but we hadn\u0027t said much. She understood that I needed to process things and had simply been there for me, not pushing me on things I didn\u0027t want to talk about - even though there were a dozen things she wanted to ask. The Academy\u0027s dead had been honored in one group memorial service, although their families had made arrangements for each person\u0027s respective funeral. I\u0027d gone to the larger service. The chapel had been packed, with standing room only. Father Andrew had read the names of the dead, listing Dimitri and Molly among them. No one was talking about what had really happened to them. There was too much other grief anyway. We were drowning in it. No one even knew how the Academy would pick up the pieces and start running again. \"You look worse than I do,\" I told Adrian. \"I didn\u0027t think that was possible.\" He brought the bottle to his lips and took a long drink. \"Nah, you always look good. As for me ... well, it\u0027s hard to explain. The auras are getting to me. There\u0027s so much sorrow around here. You can\u0027t even begin to understand. It radiates from everyone on a spiritual level. It\u0027s overwhelming. It makes your dark aura downright cheerful.\" \"Is that why you\u0027re drinking?\" \"Yup. It\u0027s shut my aura-vision right off, thankfully, so I can\u0027t give you a report today.\" He offered me the bottle, and I shook my head. He shrugged and took another drink. \"So what can I do for you, Rose? I have a feeling you aren\u0027t here to check on me.\" He was right, and I only felt a little bad about what I was here for. I\u0027d done a lot of thinking this last week. Processing my grief for Mason had been hard. In fact, I hadn\u0027t even really quite resolved it when the ghost business had started. Now I had to mourn all over again. After all, more than Dimitri had been lost. Teachers had died, guardians and Moroi alike. None of my close friends had died, but people I knew from classes had. They\u0027d been students at the Academy as long as I had, and it was weird to think I\u0027d never see them again. That was a lot of loss to deal with, a lot of people to say goodbye to. But... Dimitri. He was a different case. After all, how did you say goodbye to someone who wasn\u0027t exactly gone? That was the problem. \"I need money,\" I told Adrian, not bothering with pretense. He arched an eyebrow. \"Unexpected. From you, at least. I get that kind of request a lot from others. Pray tell, what would I be funding?\" I glanced away from him, focusing on the television. It was a commercial for some kind of deodorant. \"I\u0027m leaving the Academy,\" I said finally. \"Also unexpected. You\u0027re only a few months out from graduation.\" I met his eyes. \"It doesn\u0027t matter. I have things to do now.\" \"I never figured you\u0027d be one of the dropout guardians. You going to join the blood whores?\" \"No,\" I said. \"Of course not.\" \"Don\u0027t act so offended. That\u0027s not an unreasonable assumption. If you\u0027re not going to be a guardian, what else are you going to do?\" \"I told you. I have things I have to take care of.\" He arched an eyebrow. \"Things that are going to get you into trouble?\" I shrugged. He laughed. \"Stupid question, huh? Everything you do gets you in trouble.\" He propped his elbow up on the couch\u0027s arm and rested his chin in his hand. \"Why\u0027d you come to me for money?\" \"Because you have it.\" This also made him laugh. \"And why do you think I\u0027ll give it to you?\" I didn\u0027t say anything. I just looked at him, forcing as much womanly charm as I could into my expression. His smile went away, and his green eyes narrowed in frustration. He jerked his gaze away. \"Damn it, Rose. Don\u0027t do that. Not now. You\u0027re playing on how I feel about you. That\u0027s not fair.\" He gulped more vodka. He was right. I\u0027d come to him because I thought I could use his crush to get what I wanted. It was low, but I had no choice. Getting up, I moved over and sat beside him. I held his hand. \"Please, Adrian,\" I said. \"Please help me. You\u0027re the only one I can go to.\" \"That\u0027s not fair,\" he repeated, slurring his words a little. \"You\u0027re using those come-hither eyes on me, but it\u0027s not me you want. It\u0027s never been me. It\u0027s always been Belikov, and God only knows what you\u0027ll do now that he\u0027s gone.\" He was right about that too. \"Will you help me?\" I asked, still playing up the charisma. \"You\u0027re the only one I could talk to ... the only one who really understands me....\" \"Are you coming back?\" he countered. \"Eventually.\" Tipping his head back, he exhaled a heavy breath. His hair, which I\u0027d always thought looked stylishly messy, simply looked messy today. \"Maybe it\u0027s for the best if you leave. Maybe you\u0027ll get over him faster if you go away for a while. Wouldn\u0027t hurt to be away from Lissa\u0027s aura either. It might slow yours from darkening - stop this rage you always seem to be in. You need to be happier. And stop seeing ghosts.\" My seduction faltered for a moment. \"Lissa isn\u0027t why I\u0027m seeing ghosts. Well, she is, but not in the way you think. I see the ghosts because I\u0027m shadow-kissed. I\u0027m tied to the world of the dead, and the more I kill, the stronger that connection becomes. It\u0027s why I see the dead and why I feel weird when Strigoi are near. I can sense them now. They\u0027re tied to that world too.\" He frowned. \"You\u0027re saying the auras mean nothing? That you aren\u0027t taking away the effects of spirit?\" \"No. That\u0027s happening too. That\u0027s why this has all been so confusing. I thought there was just one thing going on, but there\u0027ve been two. I see the ghosts because of being shadow-kissed. I\u0027m getting... upset and angry... bad, even... because I\u0027m taking away Lissa\u0027s dark side. That\u0027s why my aura\u0027s darkening, why I\u0027m getting so enraged lately. Right now, it just sort of plays out as a really bad temper....\" I frowned, thinking of the night Dimitri had stopped me from going after Jesse. \"But I don\u0027t know what it\u0027ll turn into next.\" Adrian sighed. \"Why is everything so complicated with you?\" \"Will you help me? Please, Adrian?\" I ran my fingers along his hand. \"Please help me.\" Low, low. This was so low of me, but it didn\u0027t matter. Only Dimitri did. Finally, Adrian looked back at me. For the first time ever, he looked vulnerable. \"When you come back, will you give me a fair shot?\" I hid my surprise. \"What do you mean?\" \"It\u0027s like I said. You\u0027ve never wanted me, never even considered me. The flowers, the flirting ... it rolled right off you. You were so gone for him, and nobody noticed. If you go do your thing, will you take me seriously? Will you give me a chance when you return?\" I stared. I definitely hadn\u0027t expected this. My initial instinct was to say no, that I could never love anybody again, that my heart had been shattered along with that piece of my soul that Dimitri held. But Adrian was looking at me so earnestly, and there was none of his joking nature. He meant what he said, and I realized all the affection for me he\u0027d always teased about hadn\u0027t been a joke either. Lissa had been right about his feelings. \"Will you?\" he repeated. God only knows what you\u0027ll do now that he\u0027s gone. \"Of course.\" Not an honest answer, but a necessary one. Adrian looked away and drank more vodka. There wasn\u0027t much left. \"When are you leaving?\" \"Tomorrow.\" Setting the bottle down, he stood up and walked off into the bedroom. He returned with a large stack of cash. I wondered if he kept it under his bed or something. He handed it to me wordlessly and then picked up the phone and made some calls. The sun was up, and the human world, which handled most Moroi money, was also up and awake. I tried to watch TV while he talked, but I couldn\u0027t concentrate. I kept wanting to scratch the back of my neck. Because there was no way of knowing exactly how many Strigoi I and the others had killed, we\u0027d all been given a different kind of tattoo instead of the usual set of molnija marks. I\u0027d forgotten its name, but this tattoo looked like a little star. It meant that the bearer had been in a battle and killed many Strigoi. When he finally finished his calls, Adrian handed me a piece of paper. It had the name and address of a bank in Missoula. \"Go there,\" he said. \"I\u0027m guessing you have to go to Missoula first anyway if you\u0027re actually going on to anywhere civilized. There\u0027s an account set up for you with ... a lot of money in it. Talk to them, and they\u0027ll finish the paperwork with you.\" I stood up and stuffed the bills in my jacket. \"Thank you,\" I said. Without hesitating, I reached out and hugged him. The scent of vodka was overpowering, but I felt I owed him. I was taking advantage of his feelings for me in order to further my own devices. He put his arms around me and held me for several seconds before letting go. I brushed my lips against his cheek as we broke apart, and I thought he might stop breathing. \"I won\u0027t forget this,\" I murmured in his ear. \"I don\u0027t suppose you\u0027ll tell me where you\u0027re going?\" he asked. \"No,\" I said. \"I\u0027m sorry.\" \"Just keep your promise and come back.\" \"I didn\u0027t actually use the word promise,\" I pointed out. He smiled and pressed a kiss to my forehead. \"You\u0027re right. I\u0027m going to miss you, little dhampir. Be careful. If you ever need anything, let me know. I\u0027ll be waiting for you.\" I thanked him again and left, not bothering to tell him he might be waiting a long time. There was a very real possibility that I might not be coming back. The next day, I got up early, long before most of campus was awake. I\u0027d hardly slept. I slung a bag over my shoulder and walked over to the main office in the administrative building. The office wasn\u0027t open yet either, so I sat down on the floor in the hallway outside of it. Studying my hands as I waited, I noticed two tiny flecks of gold on my thumbnail. They were the only remnants of my manicure. About twenty minutes later, the secretary showed up with the keys and let me in. \"What can I do for you?\" she asked, once she was seated at her desk. I handed her a stack of papers I\u0027d been holding. \"I\u0027m withdrawing.\" Her eyes widened to impossible size. \"But...what...you can\u0027t...\" I tapped the stack. \"I can. It\u0027s all filled out.\" Still gaping, she muttered something to me about waiting, and then scurried out of the room. A few minutes later, she returned with Headmistress Kirova. Kirova had apparently been briefed and was looking at me very disapprovingly down her beaklike nose. \"Miss Hathaway, what\u0027s the meaning of this?\" \"I\u0027m leaving,\" I said. \"Quitting. Dropping out. Whatever.\" \"You can\u0027t do that,\" she said. \"Well, obviously I can, since you guys keep withdrawal paperwork in the library. It\u0027s all filled out the way it needs to be.\" Her anger changed into something sadder and more anxious. \"I know a lot has gone on lately - we\u0027re all having trouble adjusting - but that\u0027s no reason to make a hasty decision. If anything, we need you more than ever.\" She was almost pleading. Hard to believe she\u0027d wanted to expel me six months ago. \"This wasn\u0027t hasty,\" I said. \"I thought a lot about it.\" \"Let me at least get your mother so we can talk this out.\" \"She left for Europe three days ago. Not that it matters anyway.\" I pointed to the line on the top form that said date of birth. \"I\u0027m eighteen today. She can\u0027t do anything anymore. This is my choice. Now, will you stamp the form, or are you actually going to try to restrain me? Pretty sure I could take you in a fight, Kirova.\" They stamped my packet, not happily. The secretary made a copy of the official paper that declared I was no longer a student at St. Vladimir\u0027s Academy. I\u0027d need it to get out the main gate. It was a long walk to the front of the school, and the western sky was red as the sun slipped over the horizon. The weather had warmed up, even at night. Spring had finally come. It made for good walking weather since I had a ways to go before I made it to the highway. From there, I\u0027d hitchhike to Missoula. Hitchhiking wasn\u0027t safe, but the silver stake in my coat pocket made me feel pretty secure about anything I\u0027d face. No one had taken it away from me after the raid, and it would work just as well against creepy humans as it did with Strigoi. I could just make out the gates when I sensed her. Lissa. I stopped walking and turned toward a cluster of bud-covered trees. She\u0027d been standing in them, perfectly still, and had managed to hide her thoughts so well that I hadn\u0027t realized she was practically right next to me. Her hair and eyes glowed in the sunset, and she seemed too beautiful and too ethereal to be part of this dreary landscape. \"Hey,\" I said. \"Hey.\" She wrapped her arms around herself, cold even in her coat. Moroi didn\u0027t have the same resistance to temperature changes that dhampirs did. What I found warm and springlike was still chilly to her. \"I knew it,\" she said. \"Ever since that day they said his body was gone. Something told me you\u0027d do this. I was just waiting.\" \"Can you read my mind now?\" I asked ruefully. \"No, I can just read you. Finally. I can\u0027t believe how blind I was. I can\u0027t believe I never noticed. Victor\u0027s comment... he was right.\" She glanced off at the sunset, then turned her gaze back on me. A flash of anger, both in her feelings and her eyes, hit me. \"Why didn\u0027t you tell me?\" she cried. \"Why didn\u0027t you tell me you loved Dimitri?\" I stared. I couldn\u0027t remember the last time Lissa had yelled at anyone. Maybe last fall, when all the Victor insanity had gone down. Loud outbursts were my thing, not hers. Even when torturing Jesse, her voice had been deadly quiet. \"I couldn\u0027t tell anyone,\" I said. \"I\u0027m your best friend, Rose. We\u0027ve been through everything together. Do you really think I would have told? I would have kept it secret.\" I looked at the ground. \"I know you would have. I just... I don\u0027t know. I couldn\u0027t talk about it. Not even to you. I can\u0027t explain it.\" \"How...\" She groped for the question her mind had already formed. \"How serious was it? Was it just you or - ?\" \"It was both of us,\" I told her. \"He felt the same. But we knew we couldn\u0027t be together, not with our age...and, well, not when we were supposed to be protecting you.\" Lissa frowned. \"What do you mean?\" \"Dimitri always said that if we were involved, we\u0027d worry more about protecting each other than you. We couldn\u0027t do that.\" Guilt coursed through her at the thought that she\u0027d been responsible for keeping us apart. \"It\u0027s not your fault,\" I said quickly. \"Surely...there must have been a way. ... It wouldn\u0027t have been a problem....\" I shrugged, unwilling to think about or mention our last kiss in the forest, back when Dimitri and I had thought we\u0027d figured out a solution to all of our problems. \"I don\u0027t know,\" I said. \"We just tried to stay apart. Sometimes it worked. Sometimes it didn\u0027t.\" Her mind was a tumble of emotions. She felt sorry for me, but at the same time, she was mad. \"You should have told me,\" she repeated. \"I feel like you don\u0027t trust me.\" \"Of course I trust you.\" \"Is that why you\u0027re sneaking off?\" \"That has nothing to do with trust,\" I admitted. \"It\u0027s me...well, I didn\u0027t want to tell you. I couldn\u0027t bear to tell you I was leaving or explain why.\" \"I already know,\" she said. \"I figured it out.\" \"How?\" I asked. Lissa was full of surprises today. \"I was there. Last fall when we took that van into Missoula. The shopping trip? You and Dimitri were talking about Strigoi, about how becoming one makes you something twisted and evil...how it destroys the person you used to be and makes you do horrible things. And I heard ...\" She had trouble saying it. I had trouble hearing it, and my eyes grew wet. The memory was too harsh, thinking of sitting with him that day, back when we were first falling in love. Lissa swallowed and continued. \"I heard you both say you\u0027d rather die than become a monster like that.\" Silence fell between us. The wind picked up and blew our hair around, dark and light. \"I have to do this, Liss. I have to do it for him.\" \"No,\" she said firmly. \"You don\u0027t have to. You didn\u0027t promise him anything.\" \"Not in words, no. But you ... you don\u0027t understand.\" \"I understand that you\u0027re trying to cope and that this is as good a way as any. You need to find another way to let him go.\" I shook my head. \"I have to do this.\" \"Even if it means leaving me?\" The way she said it, the way she looked at me ... oh God. A flood of memories flitted through my mind. We\u0027d been together since childhood. Inseparable. Bound. And yet...Dimitri and I had been connected too. Damn it. I\u0027d never wanted to have to choose between them. \"I have to do this,\" I said yet again. \"I\u0027m sorry.\" \"You\u0027re supposed to be my guardian and go with me to college,\" she argued. \"You\u0027re shadow-kissed. We\u0027re supposed to be together. If you leave me ...\" The ugly coil of darkness was starting to raise its head in my chest. My voice was tight when I spoke. \"If I leave you, they\u0027ll get you another guardian. Two of them. You\u0027re the last Dragomir. They\u0027ll keep you safe.\" \"But they won\u0027t be you, Rose,\" she said. Those luminous green eyes held mine, and the anger in me cooled. She was so beautiful, so sweet... and she seemed so reasonable. She was right. I owed it to her. I needed to - \"Stop it!\" I yelled, turning away. She\u0027d been using her magic. \"Do not use compulsion on me. You\u0027re my friend. Friends don\u0027t use their powers on each other.\" \"Friends don\u0027t abandon each other,\" she snapped back. \"If you were my friend, you wouldn\u0027t do it.\" I spun back toward her, careful not to look too closely into her eyes, in case she tried compulsion on me again. The rage in me exploded. \"It\u0027s not about you, okay? This time, it\u0027s about me. Not you. All my life, Lissa ... all my life, it\u0027s been the same. They come first. I\u0027ve lived my life for you. I\u0027ve trained to be your shadow, but you know what? I want to come first. I need to take care of myself for once. I\u0027m tired of looking out for everyone else and having to put aside what I want. Dimitri and I did that, and look what happened. He\u0027s gone. I will never hold him again. Now I owe it to him to do this. I\u0027m sorry if it hurts you, but it\u0027s my choice!\" I\u0027d shouted the words, not even pausing for a breath, and I hoped my voice hadn\u0027t carried to the guardians on duty at the gate. Lissa was staring at me, shocked and hurt. Tears ran down her cheeks, and part of me shriveled up at hurting the person I\u0027d sworn to protect. \"You love him more than me,\" she said in a small voice, sounding very young. \"He needs me right now.\" \"I need you. He\u0027s gone, Rose.\" \"No,\" I said. \"But he will be soon.\" I reached up my sleeve and took off the chotki she\u0027d given me for Christmas. I held it out to her. She hesitated and then took it. \"What\u0027s this for?\" she asked. \"I can\u0027t wear it. It\u0027s for a Dragomir guardian. I\u0027ll take it again when I ...\" I had almost said if, not when. I think she knew that. \"When I get back.\" Her hands closed around the beads. \"Please, Rose. Please don\u0027t leave me.\" \"I\u0027m sorry,\" I said. There were no other words to offer up. \"I\u0027m sorry.\" I left her there crying as I walked toward the gate. A piece of my soul had died when Dimitri had fallen. Turning my back on her now, I felt another piece die as well. Soon there wouldn\u0027t be anything left inside of me. The guardians at the gate were as shocked as the secretary and Kirova had been, but there was nothing they could do. Happy birthday to me, I thought bitterly. Eighteen at last. It was nothing like I had expected. They opened the gates and I stepped through, outside of the school\u0027s grounds and over the wards. The lines were invisible, but I felt strangely vulnerable and exposed, as if I\u0027d leapt a great chasm. And yet, at the same time, I felt free and in control. I started walking down the narrow road. The sun was nearly gone; I\u0027d have to rely on moonlight soon. When I was out of earshot of the guardians, I stopped and spoke. \"Mason.\" I had to wait a long time. When he appeared, I could barely see him at all. He was almost completely transparent. \"It\u0027s time, isn\u0027t it? You\u0027re going...you\u0027re finally moving on to...\" Well, I had no clue where he was moving on to. I didn\u0027t know anymore what lay beyond, whether it was the realms Father Andrew believed in or some entirely different world that I\u0027d visited. Nonetheless, Mason understood and nodded. \"It\u0027s been more than forty days,\" I mused. \"So I guess you\u0027re overdue. I\u0027m glad ... I mean, I hope you find peace. Although I kind of hoped you\u0027d be able to lead me to him.\" Mason shook his head, and he didn\u0027t need to say a word for me to understand what he wanted to tell me. You\u0027re on your own now, Rose. \"It\u0027s okay. You deserve your rest. Besides, I think I know where to start looking.\" I\u0027d thought about this constantly over the last week. If Dimitri was where I believed he was, I had a lot of work ahead of me. Mason\u0027s help would have been nice, but I didn\u0027t want to keep bothering him. It seemed like he had enough to deal with. \"Goodbye,\" I told him. \"Thanks for your help I ... I\u0027ll miss you.\" His form grew fainter and fainter, and just before it went altogether, I saw the hint of a smile, that laughing and mischievous smile I\u0027d loved so much. For the first time since his death, thinking about Mason no longer devastated me. I was sad and I really would miss him, but I knew he\u0027d moved on to something good - something really good. I no longer felt guilty. Turning away, I stared at the long road winding off ahead of me. I sighed. This trip might take awhile. \"Then start walking, Rose,\" I muttered to myself. I set off, off to kill the man I loved. As always, I can never express enough gratitude to the friends and family who hang with me through the ups and downs that go along with writing a book - let alone one as powerful as this. Many thanks to David and Christina for their speedy beta reading; to LA. Gordon and Sherry Kirk for their help with Russian; to Synde Korman for her help with Romanian; to my agent Jim McCarthy who is wise and does all the hard stuff for me; to editors Jessica Rothenberg and Ben Schrank for all of their guidance; to the Team Seattle authors for their distraction and good cheer; and to Jay for being infinitely patient...and even making a good joke once in a while.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/shadow-kiss-vampire-academy-3/page-29.html","bookId":2062,"book":{"id":2062,"title":"Shadow Kiss (Vampire Academy #3)","description":"Storyline: Vampire Academy Series 3: Shadow Kiss A little background... I am in my mid 20\u0027s and a high school teacher who loves to read when I can but doesn\u0027t get much time to do it in. I picked up the twilight series a year ago at a students request and was pleasantly surprised. Once the series was finished I needed another one! Before Twilight I had not been into teen romance/ fantasy books especially with vampires and such. I saw a book-list of recommendations by Twilight followers and picked up the \"House of Night\" series by PC Cast. This was worth reading and I am waiting for the next book to come. My husband now calls me addicted to Vamps since I started looking for a new series to pick up. I was strongly recommended to pick up the Vampire Academy series by my 20 year old sister who has always been a fan of this genre of books.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/shadow-kiss-vampire-academy-3.jpg","author":"Richelle Mead","type":"Fantasy","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/shadow-kiss-vampire-academy-3.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:18 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:03:18 AM"}}
