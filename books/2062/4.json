{"id":110681,"no":4,"title":"Page 4","content":"FOUR IT BEGAN. At first, things weren\u0027t too different from any other day. Dhampirs and Moroi attended separate classes in the first half of the school day, then joined up after lunch. Christian had most of the same afternoon classes I\u0027d had last semester, so it was almost like following my own schedule again. The difference was that I was no longer a student in these classes. I didn\u0027t sit at a desk or have to do any of the work. I was also a lot more uncomfortable since I had to stand at the back of the room the entire time, along with other novices who were guarding Moroi. Outside the school, this was what it was usually like. Moroi came first. Guardians were shadows. There was a strong temptation to talk to our fellow novices, particularly during times when the Moroi were working on their own and talking amongst themselves. None of us cracked, though. The pressure and adrenaline of the first day had us all on good behavior. After biology, Eddie and I started using a bodyguard technique called pair guarding. I was near guard and walked with Lissa and Christian for immediate defense. Eddie, being far guard, walked farther away and scanned the larger area for any potential threats. We followed this pattern for the rest of the day, up until the last class came around. Lissa gave Christian a quick kiss on the cheek, and I realized they were parting. \"You guys don\u0027t have the same schedule this time?\" I asked with dismay, stepping over to the side of the hall to stay out of student traffic. Eddie had already deduced that we were parting and had stopped far guard duties to come talk to us. I hadn\u0027t known how Lissa and Christian\u0027s schedules lined up for this new semester. Lissa took in my disappointed look and gave me a sympathetic smile. \"Sorry. We\u0027re going to study together after school, but right now, I\u0027ve got to go to creative writing.\" \"And I,\" declared Christian loftily, \"have to go to culinary science.\" \"Culinary science?\" I cried. \"You elected culinary science? That\u0027s like the most brainless class ever.\" \"It is not,\" he countered. \"And even if it was ... well, hey, it\u0027s my last semester, right?\" I groaned. \"Come on, Rose,\" laughed Lissa. \"It\u0027s just one class period. It won\u0027t be that - \" She was cut off when a commotion broke out farther down the hall. We and everyone near us stopped and stared. One of my guardian instructors, Emil, had practically appeared out of nowhere and - playing Strigoi - reached for a Moroi girl. He swung her away, pressing her to his chest and exposing her neck as though he would bite her. I couldn\u0027t see who she was, just a tangle of brown hair, but her assigned protector was Shane Reyes. The attack had caught him by surprise - it was the first one of the day - but he fumbled only a little as he kicked Emil in the side and wrested the girl away. The two guys squared off, and everyone watched eagerly. A few even whistled and shouted, cheering Shane on. One of the catcallers was Ryan Aylesworth. He was so fixated on watching the fight - which Shane, wielding his practice stake, had just about won - that he didn\u0027t notice two other adult guardians sneaking up on him and Camille. Eddie and I realized it at the same time and stiffened, instinct readying both of us to spring forward. \"Stay with them,\" Eddie told me. He headed toward Ryan and Camille, who had just discovered they were being set upon. Ryan didn\u0027t react as well as Shane had, particularly since he faced two attackers. One of the guardians distracted Ryan while the other - Dimitri, I now saw - grabbed Camille. She screamed, not faking her fear. She apparently didn\u0027t find being in Dimitri\u0027s arms as thrilling as I did. Eddie headed toward them, approaching from behind, and landed a blow on the side of Dimitri\u0027s head. It hardly fazed Dimitri, but I was still amazed. I\u0027d barely ever been able to land a hit on him in all our trainings. Eddie\u0027s attack forced Dimitri to release Camille and face this new threat. He spun around, graceful as a dancer, and advanced on Eddie. Meanwhile, Shane had \"staked\" his Strigoi and jumped in to help Eddie, moving around to Dimitri\u0027s other side. I watched, fists clenched in excitement, intrigued with the fighting in general and with watching Dimitri in particular. It amazed me that someone so deadly could be so beautiful. I wished I was part of the fray but knew I had to watch the area around me in case any \"Strigoi\" attacked here. But they didn\u0027t. Shane and Eddie successfully \"finished off\" Dimitri. Part of me was a little sad at this. I wanted Dimitri to be good at everything. However, Ryan had tried to help and failed. Dimitri had technically \"killed\" him, so I felt a twisted comfort in thinking that Dimitri had still been a badass Strigoi. He and Emil praised Shane for being fast on his feet and Eddie for realizing we had to treat this as a group endeavor rather than one-on-one trials. I got a nod for watching Eddie\u0027s back, and Ryan was chastised for not paying attention to his Moroi. Eddie and I grinned at each other, happy over getting high marks on this first test. I wouldn\u0027t have minded a slightly bigger role, but this wasn\u0027t a bad start to the field experience. We high-fived, and I saw Dimitri shake his head at us as he left. With the drama over, our foursome split up. Lissa gave me one last smile over her shoulder and spoke to me through the bond, Have fun in culinary science! I rolled my eyes, but she and Eddie had already rounded a corner. \"Culinary science\" sounded pretty impressive, but really, it was just a fancy term for what was essentially a cooking class. Despite my teasing Christian about it being brainless, I had some respect for it. I could barely boil water, after all. Still, it was a lot different from an elective like creative writing or debate, and I had no doubts Christian was taking it as a blow-off class and not because he wanted to be a chef someday. At least I might get some satisfaction out of watching him mix a cake or something. Maybe he\u0027d even wear an apron. There were three other novices in the class who were guarding Moroi. Since the culinary science room was large and open, with lots of windows, the four of us worked together to come up with a plan to pool our efforts and secure the whole room. When I\u0027d watched novices do their field experiences in past years, I\u0027d only ever paid attention to the fights. I\u0027d never noticed the teamwork and strategizing that must have been going on. Theoretically, the four of us were here to only protect our assigned Moroi, but we\u0027d slipped into a role where we were protecting the whole class. My post was by a fire door that led outside of the school. Coincidentally, it was right by the station Christian was working at. The class normally cooked in pairs, but there was an odd number of students. Rather than work in a group of three, Christian had volunteered to be by himself. No one had seemed to mind. Many still regarded him and his family with the same prejudice that Jesse did. To my disappointment, Christian wasn\u0027t making a cake. \"What is that?\" I asked, watching him take out a bowl of some kind of raw, ground-up meat from the refrigerator. \"Meat,\" he said, dumping it onto a cutting board. \"I know that, you idiot. What kind?\" \"Ground beef.\" He pulled another container out and then another. \"And this is veal. And this is pork.\" \"Do you have, like, a T.rex that you\u0027re going to feed?\" \"Only if you want some. This is for meatloaf.\" I stared. \"With three kinds of meat?\" \"Why eat something called meatloaf if you aren\u0027t actually going to get some meat out of it?\" I shook my head. \"I can\u0027t believe this is only the first day with you.\" He glanced down, focusing on kneading his tri-meat creation together. \"You sure are making a big deal out of this. Do you really hate me that much? I heard you were screaming at the top of your lungs back in the gym.\" \"No, I wasn\u0027t. And ... I don\u0027t hate you at all,\" I admitted. \"You\u0027re just taking it out on me because you didn\u0027t get paired with Lissa.\" I didn\u0027t answer. He wasn\u0027t that far off. \"You know,\" he continued, \"it might actually be a good idea for you to practice with someone different.\" \"I know. That\u0027s what Dimitri says too.\" Christian put the meat into a bowl and started adding some other ingredients. \"Then why question it? Belikov knows what he\u0027s doing. I\u0027d trust anything he says. It sucks that they\u0027re going to lose him after we graduate, but I\u0027d rather see him with Lissa.\" \"Me too.\" He paused and looked up, meeting my eyes. We both smiled, amused at how shocked we were to have agreed with each other. A moment later, he returned to his work. \"You\u0027re good too,\" he said, not too grudgingly. \"The way you handled yourself...\" He didn\u0027t finish the thought, but I knew what he was talking about. Spokane. Christian hadn\u0027t been around when I killed the Strigoi, but he\u0027d been instrumental in helping with the escape. He and I had teamed up, using his fire magic as a means of letting me subdue our captors. We\u0027d worked well together, all of our animosity put aside. \"I guess you and I have better things to do than fight all the time,\" I mused. Like worry about Victor Dashkov\u0027s trial, I realized. For a moment, I considered telling Christian what I\u0027d learned. He\u0027d been around the night it had all gone down with Victor last fall, but I decided not to mention the news just yet. Lissa needed to hear it first. \"Yup,\" Christian said, unaware of my thoughts. \"Brace yourself, but we aren\u0027t that different. I mean, I\u0027m smarter and a lot funnier, but at the end of the day, we both want to keep her safe.\" He hesitated. \"You know...I\u0027m not going to take her away from you. I can\u0027t. No one can, not as long as you guys have that bond.\" I was surprised he\u0027d brought this up. I honestly suspected that there were two reasons he and I argued a lot. One was that we both had personalities that liked to argue. The other reason - the big one - was that we were each envious of the other\u0027s relationship with Lissa. But, as he\u0027d said, we really had the same motives. We cared about her. \"And don\u0027t think the bond will keep you guys apart,\" I said. I knew the link bothered him. How could you ever get romantically close to someone when they had that kind of connection with another person, even if that other person was just a friend? \"She cares about you. ...\" I couldn\u0027t bring myself to say \"loves.\" \"She has a whole separate place for you in her heart.\" Christian put his dish in the oven. \"You did not just say that. I have a feeling we\u0027re on the verge of hugging and coming up with cute nicknames for each other.\" He was trying to look disgusted at my sentiment, but I could tell he liked being told that Lissa cared about him. \"I already have a nickname for you, but I\u0027ll get in trouble if I say it in class.\" \"Ah,\" he said happily. \"That\u0027s the Rose I know.\" He went off to talk to another friend while his meatloaf cooked, which was probably just as well. My door was a vulnerable position, and I shouldn\u0027t have been chatting away, even if the rest of the class was. Across the room, I saw Jesse and Ralf working together. Like Christian, they\u0027d chosen a blow-off class too. No attacks occurred, but a guardian named Dustin did come in to make notes on us novices as we held our positions. He was standing near me right when Jesse chose to stroll by. At first, I thought it was a coincidence - until Jesse spoke. \"I take back what I said earlier, Rose. I figured it out. You aren\u0027t upset because of Lissa or Christian. You\u0027re upset because the rules say you have to be with a student, and Adrian Ivashkov\u0027s too old. The way I hear it, you guys have already had a lot of practice watching each other\u0027s bodies.\" That joke could have been so much funnier, but I\u0027d learned not to expect too much from Jesse. I knew for a fact that he didn\u0027t care about Adrian and me. I also suspected he didn\u0027t even believe we had anything going on. But Jesse was still bitter about me threatening him earlier, and here was his chance to get back at me. Dustin, standing within earshot, had no interest in Jesse\u0027s idiotic teasing. Dustin would probably have an interest, however, if I slammed Jesse\u0027s face into the wall. That didn\u0027t mean I had to be silent, though. Guardians talked to Moroi all the time; they just tended to be respectful and still keep an eye on their surroundings. So I gave Jesse a small smile and simply said, \"Your wit is always such a delight, Mr. Zeklos. I can barely contain myself around it.\" I then turned away and surveyed the rest of the room. When Jesse realized I wasn\u0027t going to do anything else, he laughed and walked away, apparently thinking he\u0027d won some great victory. Dustin left shortly thereafter. \"Asshole,\" muttered Christian, returning to his station. Class had about five minutes left. My eyes followed Jesse across the room. \"You know something, Christian? I\u0027m pretty happy to be guarding you.\" \"If you\u0027re comparing me to Zeklos, I don\u0027t really take that as much of a compliment. But here, try this. Then you\u0027ll really be glad you\u0027re with me.\" His masterpiece was finished, and he gave me a piece. I hadn\u0027t realized it, but just before the meatloaf had gone in, he\u0027d wrapped it in bacon. \"Good God,\" I said. \"This is the most stereotypical vampire food ever.\" \"Only if it was raw. What do you think?\" \"It\u0027s good,\" I said reluctantly. Who knew that bacon would make all the difference? \"Really good. I think you have a promising future as a housewife while Lissa works and makes millions of dollars.\" \"Funny, that\u0027s exactly my dream.\" We left the class in lighter moods. Things had grown more friendly between us, and I decided that I could handle the next six weeks protecting him. He and Lissa were going to meet in the library to study - or pretend to study - but he had to stop by his dorm first. So I followed him across the quad, back into the winter air that had grown chillier since sunset seven hours ago. The snow on the paths, which had turned slushy in the sun, had now frozen up and made walking treacherous. Along the way, we were joined by Brandon Lazar, a Moroi who lived in Christian\u0027s hall. Brandon could barely contain himself, recapping a fight he\u0027d witnessed in his math class. We listened to his rendition, all of us laughing at the thought of Alberta sneaking in through the window. \"Hey, she might be old, but she could take on almost any of us,\" I told them. I gave Brandon a puzzled look. He had bruises and red splotches on his face. He also had a few weird welts near his ear. \"What happened to you? Have you been fighting guardians too?\" His smile promptly disappeared, and he looked away from me. \"Nah, just fell.\" \"Come on,\" I said. Moroi might not train to fight like dhampirs did, but they got in brawls with each other just as often as anyone else. I tried to think of any Moroi he might have a conflict with. For the most part, Brandon was pretty likeable. \"That\u0027s the lamest, most unoriginal excuse in the world.\" \"It\u0027s true,\" he said, still avoiding my eyes. \"If someone\u0027s screwing with you, I can give you a few pointers.\" He turned back to me, locking eyes. \"Just let it go.\" He wasn\u0027t hostile or anything, but there was a firm note in his voice. It was almost like he believed saying the words alone would make me obey him. I chuckled. \"What are you trying to do? Compel me - \" Suddenly, I saw movement on my left. A slight shadow blending in with the dark shapes of a cluster of snowy pine trees - but moving just enough to catch my attention. Stan\u0027s face emerged from the darkness as he sprang toward us. Finally, my first test. Adrenaline shot through me just as strongly as if a real Strigoi were approaching. I reacted instantly, reaching out to grab both Brandon and Christian. That was always the first move, to throw my own life before theirs. I jerked the two guys to a halt and turned toward my attacker, reaching for my stake in order to defend the Moroi - And that\u0027s when he appeared. Mason. He stood several feet in front of me, off to Stan\u0027s right, looking just as he had last night. Translucent. Shimmering. Sad. The hair on the back of my neck stood up. I froze, unable to move or finish going for my stake. I forgot about what I\u0027d been doing and completely lost track of the people and commotion around me. The world slowed down, everything fading around me. There was only Mason - that ghostly, shimmering Mason who glowed in the dark and seemed like he so badly wanted to tell me something. The same feeling of helplessness I\u0027d experienced in Spokane returned to me. I hadn\u0027t been able to help him then. I couldn\u0027t help him now. My stomach turned cold and hollow. I could do nothing except stand there, wondering what he was trying to say. He lifted one translucent hand and pointed off toward the other side of campus, but I didn\u0027t know what it meant. There was so much over there, and it wasn\u0027t clear what he was pointing at. I shook my head, not understanding but desperately wishing I could. The sorrow on his face seemed to grow. Suddenly, something slammed into my shoulder, and I stumbled forward. The world suddenly started up again, snapping me out of the dreamy state I\u0027d just been in. I only barely managed to throw out my hands in time to stop myself from hitting the ground. I looked up and saw Stan standing over me. \"Hathaway!\" he barked. \"What are you doing?\" I blinked, still trying to shake off the weirdness of seeing Mason again. I felt sluggish and dazed. I looked into Stan\u0027s angry face and then glanced over at where Mason had been. He was gone. I turned my attention back to Stan and realized what had happened. In my distraction, I\u0027d completely spaced while he\u0027d staged his attack. He now had one arm around Christian\u0027s neck and one around Brandon\u0027s. He wasn\u0027t hurting them, but his point was made. \"If I had been a Strigoi,\" he growled, \"these two would be dead.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/shadow-kiss-vampire-academy-3/page-4.html","bookId":2062,"book":{"id":2062,"title":"Shadow Kiss (Vampire Academy #3)","description":"Storyline: Vampire Academy Series 3: Shadow Kiss A little background... I am in my mid 20\u0027s and a high school teacher who loves to read when I can but doesn\u0027t get much time to do it in. I picked up the twilight series a year ago at a students request and was pleasantly surprised. Once the series was finished I needed another one! Before Twilight I had not been into teen romance/ fantasy books especially with vampires and such. I saw a book-list of recommendations by Twilight followers and picked up the \"House of Night\" series by PC Cast. This was worth reading and I am waiting for the next book to come. My husband now calls me addicted to Vamps since I started looking for a new series to pick up. I was strongly recommended to pick up the Vampire Academy series by my 20 year old sister who has always been a fan of this genre of books.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/shadow-kiss-vampire-academy-3.jpg","author":"Richelle Mead","type":"Fantasy","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/shadow-kiss-vampire-academy-3.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:18 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:03:18 AM"}}
