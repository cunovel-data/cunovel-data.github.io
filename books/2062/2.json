His form was insubstantial - almost translucent - and kept fading in and out of my field of vision.\\n\\n But yes, from what I could see, he definitely looked like Mason. His features were washed out, making his fair skin look whiter than I recalled. His reddish hair now appeared as a faint, watery orange. I could barely even see his freckles. He was wearing exactly what I\u0027d last seen him in: jeans and a yellow fleece jacket. The edge of a green sweater peeped out from underneath the coat\u0027s hem. Those colors, too, were all softened. He looked like a photograph that someone had left out in the sun, causing it to fade. A very, very faint glow seemed to outline his features.\\n\\n The part that struck me the most - aside from the fact that he was supposed to be dead - was the look on his face. It was sad - so, so sad. Looking into his eyes, I felt my heart break. All the memories of what had taken place just a few weeks ago came rushing back to me. I saw it all again: his body falling, the cruel look on the Strigoi faces.... A lump formed in my throat. I stood there frozen, stunned and unable to move.\\n\\n He studied me too, his expression never changing. Sad. Grim. Serious. He opened his mouth, like he might speak, and then closed it. Several more heavy moments hung between us, and then he lifted his hand and extended it toward me. Something in that motion snapped me out of my daze. No, this could not be happening. I wasn\u0027t seeing this. Mason was dead. I\u0027d seen him die. I\u0027d held his body.\\n\\n His fingers moved slightly, like he was beckoning, and I panicked. Backing up a few steps, I put distance between us and waited to see what would happen. He didn\u0027t follow. He simply stood there, hand still in the air. My heart lurched, and I turned and ran. When I\u0027d almost reached the door, I stopped and glanced back, letting my ragged breathing calm down. The clearing he\u0027d stood in was completely empty.\\n\\n I made it up to my room and slammed the door behind me, hands shaking. I sank onto my bed and replayed what had just happened.\\n\\n What the hell? That had not been real. No way. Impossible. Mason was dead, and everyone knows the dead don\u0027t come back. Well, yeah, I had come back...but that was a different situation.\\n\\n Clearly, I\u0027d imagined this. That was it. It had to be. I was overtired and still reeling from Lissa and Christian, not to mention that Victor Dashkov news. Probably the cold had frozen part of my brain too. Yes, the more I thought about it, the more I decided there had to be a hundred explanations for what had just happened.\\n\\n Yet, no matter how often I told myself that, I couldn\u0027t fall back asleep. I lay in my bed, covers pulled to my chin as I tried to banish that haunting image from my mind. I couldn\u0027t. All I could see were those sad, sad eyes, those eyes that seemed to say, Rose, why did you let this happen to me?\\n\\n I squeezed my eyes shut, trying not to think about him. Since Mason\u0027s funeral, I\u0027d been working so hard to go on and act like I was strong. But the truth was, I was nowhere near being over his death. I tortured myself day after day with what if? questions. What if I\u0027d been faster and stronger during the Strigoi fight? What if I hadn\u0027t told him where the Strigoi were in the first place? And what if I\u0027d simply been able to return his love? Any of those could have kept him alive, but none of them had happened. And it was all my fault.\\n\\n \"I imagined it,\" I whispered out loud into the darkness of my room. I had to have imagined it. Mason already haunted my dreams. I didn\u0027t need to see him when I was awake too. \"It wasn\u0027t him.\"\\n\\n It couldn\u0027t have been him, because the only way it could have been was...Well, that was something I didn\u0027t want to think about. Because while I believed in vampires and magic and psychic powers, I most certainly did not believe in ghosts.\\n\\n I apparently didn\u0027t believe in sleep, either, because I didn\u0027t get much of it that night. I tossed and turned, unable to quiet my racing mind. I eventually did drift off, but it seemed like my alarm went off so soon after that I could have hardly slept for more than a few minutes.\\n\\n Among humans, the light of day tends to chase off nightmares and fear. I had no such daylight; I awoke to increasing darkness. But just being out with real and living people had nearly the same effect, and as I went to breakfast and my morning practice, I found that what I\u0027d seen last night - or what I thought I\u0027d seen last night - was growing fainter and fainter in my memory.\\n\\n The weirdness of that encounter was also being replaced by something else: excitement. This was it. The big day. The start of our field experience.\\n\\n For the next six weeks, I wouldn\u0027t have any classes. I\u0027d get to spend my days hanging out with Lissa, and the most I\u0027d have to do was write a daily field report that was only about a half-page long. Easy. And, yeah, of course I\u0027d be on guard duty, but I wasn\u0027t concerned. That was second nature to me. She and I had lived among humans for two years, and I\u0027d protected her the whole time. Before that, when I\u0027d been a freshman, I\u0027d seen the kinds of tests the adult guardians planned for novices during this phase. The ordeals were tricky, absolutely. A novice had to be on watch and not slack - and be ready to defend and attack if necessary. None of that worried me, though. Lissa and I had been away from the school our sophomore and junior years, and I\u0027d fallen behind then. Thanks to my extra practices with Dimitri, I\u0027d quickly caught up and was now one of the best in my class.\\n\\n \"Hey, Rose.\"\\n\\n Eddie Castile caught up to me as I walked into the gym where our field experience orientation would kick off. For a brief moment, looking at Eddie, my heart sank. Suddenly, it was like I was out in the quad again with Mason, staring at his sorrowful face.\\n\\n Eddie - along with Lissa\u0027s boyfriend, Christian, and a Moroi named Mia - had been with our group when we\u0027d been captured by Strigoi. Eddie hadn\u0027t died, obviously, but he\u0027d come very close to it. The Strigoi who\u0027d held us had used him as food, feeding from him throughout our capture in an effort to tease the Moroi and scare the dhampirs. It had worked; I\u0027d been terrified. Poor Eddie had been unconscious for most of the ordeal, thanks to blood loss and the endorphins that came from a vampire\u0027s bite. He\u0027d been Mason\u0027s best friend and nearly as funny and lighthearted.\\n\\n But since we\u0027d escaped, Eddie had changed, just like I had. He was still quick to smile and laugh, but there was a grimness to him now, a dark and serious look in his eyes that was always on guard for the worst to happen. That was understandable, of course. He pretty much had seen the worst happen. Just like with Mason\u0027s death, I held myself responsible for this transformation in Eddie and for what he\u0027d suffered at the hands of the Strigoi. That may not have been fair to me, but I couldn\u0027t help it. I felt like I owed him now, like I needed to protect him or make things up to him somehow.\\n\\n And that was kind of funny, because I think Eddie was trying to protect me. He wasn\u0027t stalking me or anything, but I\u0027d noticed him keeping an eye on me. I think after what had happened, he felt he owed it to Mason to watch over his girlfriend. I never bothered to tell Eddie that I hadn\u0027t been Mason\u0027s girlfriend, not in the real sense of the word, just as I never rebuked Eddie for his big brother behavior. I could certainly take care of myself. But whenever I heard him warning other guys away from me, pointing out that I wasn\u0027t ready to date anyone yet, I saw no point in interfering. It was all true. I wasn\u0027t ready to date.\\n\\n Eddie gave me a lopsided smile that added a little boy type of cuteness to his long face. \"Are you excited?\"\\n\\n \"Hell, yeah,\" I said. Our classmates were filling in bleachers on one side of the gym, and we found a clear spot near the middle. \"It\u0027s going to be like a vacation. Me and Lissa, together for six weeks.\" As frustrating as our bond was sometimes, it nonetheless made me her ideal guardian. I always knew where she was and what was happening to her. Once we graduated and were out in the world, I\u0027d be assigned to her officially.\\n\\n He turned thoughtful. \"Yeah, I guess you don\u0027t have to worry as much. You know your assignment when you graduate. The rest of us aren\u0027t so lucky.\"\\n\\n \"You got your sights set on someone royal?\" I teased.\\n\\n \"Well, it doesn\u0027t matter. Most guardians are assigned to royals lately anyway.\"\\n\\n That was true. Dhampirs - half-vampires like me - were in short supply, and royals usually got first pick of guardians. There was a time in the past when more Moroi, royal and non-royal alike, would have gotten guardians, and novices like us would have competed fiercely to get assigned to someone important. Now it was almost a given that every guardian would work for a royal family. There weren\u0027t enough of us to go around, and less influential families were on their own.\\n\\n \"Still,\" I said, \"I guess it\u0027s a question of which royal you get, right? I mean, some are total snobs, but lots of them are cool. Get someone really rich and powerful, and you could be living at the Royal Court or traveling to exotic places.\" That last part appealed to me a lot, and I often had fantasies of Lissa and me traveling the world.\\n\\n \"Yup,\" agreed Eddie. He nodded toward a few guys in the front row. \"You wouldn\u0027t believe the way those three have been sucking up to some of the Ivashkovs and Szelskys. It won\u0027t affect their assignments here, of course, but you can tell they\u0027re already trying to set things up after graduation.\"\\n\\n \"Well, the field experience can affect that. How we\u0027re rated on this will go into our records.\"\\n\\n Eddie nodded again and started to say something when a loud, clear feminine voice cut through the murmur of our conversation. We both looked up. While we\u0027d been talking, our instructors had gathered in front of the bleachers and now stood facing us in an impressive line. Dimitri was among them, dark and imposing and irresistible. Alberta was trying to call us to attention. The crowd fell silent.\\n\\n \"All right,\" she began. Alberta was in her fifties, wiry and tough. Seeing her reminded me of the conversation she and Dimitri had had last night, but I filed that away for later. Victor Dashkov was not going to ruin this moment. \"You all know why you\u0027re here.\" We\u0027d become so quiet, so tense and excited, that her voice now rang through the gym. \"This is the most important day of your education before you take your final trials. Today you will find out which Moroi you\u0027ve been placed with. Last week, you were given a booklet with the full details of how the next six weeks will play out. I trust you\u0027ve all read it by now.\" I had, actually. I\u0027d probably never read anything so thoroughly in my life. \"Just to recap, Guardian Alto will highlight the main rules of this exercise.\"\\n\\n She handed a clipboard to Guardian Stan Alto. He was one of my least favorite instructors, but after Mason\u0027s death, some of the tension between us had lightened. We understood each other better now.\\n\\n \"Here we go,\" said Stan gruffly. \"You\u0027ll be on duty six days a week. This is actually a treat for you guys. In the real world, you\u0027re usually working every day. You will accompany your Moroi everywhere - to class, to their dorms, to their feedings. Everything. It\u0027s up to you to figure out how you fit into their lives. Some Moroi interact with their guardians just like friends; some Moroi prefer you to be more of an invisible ghost who doesn\u0027t talk to them.\" Did he have to use the word ghost? \"Every situation is different, and you two will have to find a way to work it out to best ensure their safety.\\n\\n \"Attacks may come at any time, anywhere, and we\u0027ll be dressed in all black when it happens. You should always be on your guard. Remember, even though you\u0027ll obviously know it\u0027s us doing the attacking and not real Strigoi, you should respond as though your lives are in terrible, immediate danger. Don\u0027t be afraid of hurting us. Some of you, I\u0027m sure, won\u0027t have any qualms about getting us back for past grievances.\" Students in the crowd giggled at this. \"But some of you may feel like you have to hold back, for fear of getting in trouble. Don\u0027t. You\u0027ll get in more trouble if you do hold back. Don\u0027t worry. We can take it.\"\\n\\n He flipped to the next page of his clipboard. \"You will be on duty twenty-four hours a day for your six-day cycles, but you may sleep during daylight when your Moroi does. Just be aware that although Strigoi attacks are rare in daylight, they aren\u0027t impossible indoors, and you will not necessarily be \u0027safe\u0027 during these times.\"\\n\\n Stan read over a few more technicalities, and I found myself tuning them out. I knew this stuff. We all did. Glancing around, I could see I wasn\u0027t alone in my impatience. Excitement and apprehension crackled in the crowd. Hands were clenched. Eyes were wide. We all wanted our assignments. We all wanted this to begin.\\n\\n When Stan finished, he handed the clipboard to Alberta. \"Okay,\" she said. \"I\u0027m going to call out your names one by one and announce who you\u0027re paired with. At that time, come down here to the floor, and Guardian Chase will give you a packet containing information about your Moroi\u0027s schedule, past, etcetera.\"\\n\\n We all straightened up as she leafed through her papers. Students whispered. Beside me, Eddie exhaled heavily. \"Oh man. I hope I get someone good,\" he muttered. \"I don\u0027t want to be miserable for the next six weeks.\"\\n\\n I squeezed his arm reassuringly. \"You will,\" I whispered back. \"Er, get someone good, I mean. Not be miserable.\"\\n\\n \"Ryan Aylesworth,\" Alberta announced clearly. Eddie flinched, and I instantly knew why. Before, Mason Ashford had always been the first one called on any class lists. That would never happen again. \"You are assigned to Camille Conta.\"\\n\\n \"Damn,\" muttered someone behind us, who\u0027d apparently been hoping to get Camille.\\n\\n Ryan was one of the suck-ups in the front row, and he grinned broadly as he walked over to take his packet. The Contas were an up-and-coming royal family. It was rumored that one of their members was a candidate for when the Moroi queen eventually named her heir. Plus, Camille was pretty cute. Following her around wouldn\u0027t be too hard for any guy. Ryan, walking with a swagger, seemed very pleased with himself.\\n\\n \"Dean Barnes,\" she said next. \"You have Jesse Zeklos.\"\\n\\n \"Ugh,\" Eddie and I both said together. If I\u0027d been assigned to Jesse, he would have needed an extra person to protect him. From me.\\n\\n Alberta kept reading names, and I noticed Eddie was sweating. \"Please, please let me get someone good,\" he muttered.\\n\\n \"You will,\" I said. \"You will.\"\\n\\n \"Edison Castile,\" Alberta announced. He gulped. \"Vasilisa Dragomir.\"\\n\\n Eddie and I both froze for the space of a heartbeat, and then duty made him stand up and head toward the floor. As he stepped down the bleachers, he shot me a quick, panicked look over his shoulder. His expression seemed to say, I don\u0027t know! I don\u0027t know!\\n\\n That made two of us. The world around me slowed to a blur. Alberta kept calling names, but I didn\u0027t hear any of them. What was going on? Clearly, someone had made a mistake. Lissa was my assignment. She had to be. I was going to be her guardian when we graduated. This made no sense. Heart racing, I watched Eddie walk over to Guardian Chase and get his packet and practice stake. He glanced down at the papers immediately, and I suspected he was double-checking the name, certain there was a mix-up. The expression on his face when he looked up told me that it was Lissa\u0027s name he\u0027d found.\\n\\n I took a deep breath. Okay. No need to panic just yet. Someone had made a clerical error here, one that could be fixed. In fact, they\u0027d have to fix it soon. When they got to me and read Lissa\u0027s name again, they were going to realize they\u0027d double-booked one of the Moroi. They\u0027d straighten it out and give Eddie someone else. After all, there were plenty of Moroi to go around. They outnumbered dhampirs at the school.\\n\\n \"Rosemarie Hathaway.\" I tensed. \"Christian Ozera.\"\\n\\n I simply stared at Alberta, unable to move or respond. No. She had not just said what I thought. A few people, noticing my lack of movement, glanced back at me. But I was dumbstruck. This wasn\u0027t happening. My Mason delusion from last night seemed more real than this. A few moments later, Alberta also realized I wasn\u0027t moving. She looked up from her clipboard with annoyance, scanning the crowd.\\n\\n \"Rose Hathaway?\"\\n\\n Someone elbowed me, like maybe I didn\u0027t recognize my own name. Swallowing, I stood and walked down the bleachers, robot-like. There was a mistake. There had to be a mistake. I headed toward Guardian Chase, feeling like a puppet that someone else was controlling. He handed me my packet and a practice stake meant to \"kill\" the adult guardians with, and I stepped out of the way for the next person.\\n\\n Disbelieving, I read the words on the packet\u0027s cover three times. Christian Ozera. Flipping it open, I saw his life spread out before me. A current picture. His class schedule. His family tree. His bio. It even went into detail about his parents\u0027 tragic history, how they\u0027d chosen to become Strigoi and had murdered several people before finally being hunted down and killed.\\n\\n Our directions at this point had been to read through our dossiers, pack a bag, and then meet up with our Moroi at lunch. As more names were called, many of my classmates lingered around the gym, talking to their friends and showing off their packets. I hovered near one group, discreetly waiting for a chance to talk to Alberta and Dimitri. It was a sign of my newly developing patience that I didn\u0027t walk right up to them then and there and demand answers. Believe me, I wanted to. Instead, I let them go through their list, but it felt like forever. Honestly, how long did it take to read a bunch of names?\\n\\n When the last novice had been assigned his Moroi, Stan shouted above the din for us to move on to the next stage of the assignment and tried to herd out my classmates. I cut through the crowd and stalked up to Dimitri and Alberta, who blessedly were standing with each other. They were chatting about something administrative and didn\u0027t notice me right away.\\n\\n When they did glance at me, I held up my packet and pointed. \"What\u0027s this?\"\\n\\n Alberta\u0027s face looked blank and confused. Something in Dimitri\u0027s told me he\u0027d been expecting this. \"It\u0027s your assignment, Miss Hathaway,\" Alberta said.\\n\\n \"No,\" I said through gritted teeth. \"It\u0027s not. This is somebody else\u0027s assignment.\"\\n\\n \"The assignments in your field experience aren\u0027t optional,\" she told me sternly. \"Just as your assignments in the real world won\u0027t be. You can\u0027t pick who you protect based on whim and mood, not here and certainly not after graduation.\"\\n\\n \"But after graduation, I\u0027m going to be Lissa\u0027s guardian!\" I exclaimed. \"Everyone knows that. I\u0027m supposed to have her for this thing.\"\\n\\n \"I know it\u0027s an accepted idea that you\u0027ll be together after graduation, but I do not recall any mandatory rulings that say you\u0027re \u0027supposed\u0027 to have her or anyone here at school. You take who you\u0027re assigned.\"\\n\\n \"Christian?\" I threw my packet on the floor. \"You\u0027re out of your mind if you think I\u0027m guarding him.\"\\n\\n \"Rose!\" snapped Dimitri, joining the conversation at last. His voice was so hard and so sharp that I flinched and forgot what I was saying for half a second. \"You\u0027re out of line. You do not speak to your instructors like that.\"\\n\\n I hated being chastised by anyone. I especially hated being chastised by him. And I especially hated being chastised by him when he was right. But I couldn\u0027t help it. I was too angry, and the lack of sleep was taking its toll. My nerves felt raw and strained, and suddenly, little things seemed difficult to bear. And big things like this? Impossible to bear.\\n\\n \"Sorry,\" I said with great reluctance. \"But this is stupid. Nearly as stupid as not bringing us to Victor Dashkov\u0027s trial.\"\\n\\n Alberta blinked in surprise. \"How did you know - Never mind. We\u0027ll deal with that later. For now, this is your assignment, and you need to do it.\"\\n\\n Eddie suddenly spoke up beside me, his voice filled with apprehension. I\u0027d lost track of him earlier. \"Look ... I don\u0027t mind.... We can switch....\"\\n\\n Alberta turned her stony gaze from me to him. \"No, you certainly cannot. Vasilisa Dragomir is your assignment.\" She looked back at me. \"And Christian Ozera is yours. End of discussion.\"\\n\\n \"This is stupid!\" I repeated. \"Why should I waste my time with Christian? Lissa\u0027s the one I\u0027m going to be with when I graduate. Seems like if you want me to be able to do a good job, you should have me practice with her.\"\\n\\n \"You will do a good job with her,\" said Dimitri. \"Because you know her. And you have your bond. But somewhere, someday, you could end up with a different Moroi. You need to learn how to guard someone with whom you have absolutely no experience.\"\\n\\n \"I have experience with Christian,\" I grumbled. \"That\u0027s the problem. I hate him.\" Okay, that was a huge exaggeration. Christian annoyed me, true, but I didn\u0027t really hate him. As I\u0027d said, working together against the Strigoi had changed a lot of things. Again, I felt like my lack of sleep and general irritability were cranking up the magnitude of everything.\\n\\n \"So much the better,\" said Alberta. \"Not everyone you protect will be your friend. Not everyone you protect will be someone you like. You need to learn this.\"\\n\\n \"I need to learn how to fight Strigoi,\" I said. \"I\u0027ve learned that in class.\" I fixed them with a sharp look, ready to play my trump card. \"And I\u0027ve done it in person.\"\\n\\n \"There\u0027s more to this job than the technicalities, Miss Hathaway. There\u0027s a whole personal aspect - a bedside manner, if you will - that we don\u0027t touch on much in class. We teach you how to deal with the Strigoi. You need to learn how to deal with the Moroi yourselves. And you in particular need to deal with someone who has not been your best friend for years.\"\\n\\n \"You also need to learn what it\u0027s like to work with someone when you can\u0027t instantly sense that they\u0027re in danger,\" added Dimitri.\\n\\n \"Right,\" agreed Alberta. \"That\u0027s a handicap. If you want to be a good guardian - if you want to be an excellent guardian - then you need to do as we say.\"\\n\\n I opened my mouth to fight this, to argue that having someone I was so close to would train me up faster and make me a better guardian for any other Moroi. Dimitri cut me off.\\n\\n \"Working with another Moroi will also help keep Lissa alive,\" he said.\\n\\n That shut me down. It was pretty much the only thing that could have, and damn him, he knew it.\\n\\n \"What do you mean?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"Lissa\u0027s got a handicap too - you. If she never has a chance to learn what it\u0027s like to be guarded by someone without a psychic connection, she could be at greater risk if attacked. Guarding someone is really a two-person relationship. This assignment for your field experience is as much for her as for you.\"\\n\\n I stayed silent as I processed his words. They almost made sense.\\n\\n \"And,\" added Alberta, \"it\u0027s the only assignment you\u0027re going to get. If you don\u0027t take it, then you opt out of the field experience.\"\\n\\n Opt out? Was she crazy? It wasn\u0027t like a class I could sit out from for one day. If I didn\u0027t do my field experience, I didn\u0027t graduate. I wanted to explode about unfairness, but Dimitri stopped me without saying a word. The constant, calm look in his dark eyes held me back, encouraging me to accept this gracefully - or as close as I could manage.\\n\\n Reluctantly I picked up the packet. \"Fine,\" I said icily. \"I\u0027ll do this. But I want it noted that I\u0027m doing this against my will.\"\\n\\n \"I think we already figured that out, Miss Hathaway,\" remarked Alberta dryly.\\n\\n \"Whatever. I still think it\u0027s a horrible idea, and you eventually will too.\"\\n\\n I turned and stormed off across the gym before any of them could respond. In doing so, I fully realized what a bitchy little brat I sounded like. But if they\u0027d just endured their best friend\u0027s sex life, seen a ghost, and hardly gotten any sleep, they\u0027d have been bitchy too. Plus, I was about to spend six weeks with Christian Ozera. He was sarcastic, difficult, and made jokes about everything.\\n\\n Actually, he was a lot like me.\\n\\n It was going to be a long six weeks. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/shadow-kiss-vampire-academy-3/page-2.html","bookId":2062,"book":{"id":2062,"title":"Shadow Kiss (Vampire Academy #3)","description":"Storyline: Vampire Academy Series 3: Shadow Kiss \\n A little background...
