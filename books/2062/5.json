She oversaw Moroi and dhampirs alike and was known for her creative and oft-used repertoire of punishments. She wasn\u0027t cruel, exactly, but she wasn\u0027t soft, either. She simply took student behavior seriously and dealt with it as she saw fit.\\n\\n There were some issues, however, that were beyond her jurisdiction.\\n\\n The school\u0027s guardians calling together a disciplinary committee wasn\u0027t unheard of, but it was very, very rare. You had to do something pretty serious to piss them off to get that sort of response. Like, say, willfully endangering a Moroi. Or hypothetically willfully endangering a Moroi.\\n\\n \"For the last time,\" I growled, \"I didn\u0027t do it on purpose.\"\\n\\n I sat in one of the guardians\u0027 meeting rooms, facing my committee: Alberta, Emil, and one of the other rare female guardians on campus, Celeste. They sat at a long table, looking imposing, while I sat in a single chair and felt very vulnerable. Several other guardians were sitting in and watching, but thankfully, none of my classmates were there to see this humiliation. Dimitri was among the watchers. He was not on the committee, and I wondered if they\u0027d kept him off because of his potentially biased role as my mentor.\\n\\n \"Miss Hathaway,\" said Alberta, fully in her strict-captain mode, \"you must know why we have a hard time believing that.\"\\n\\n Celeste nodded. \"Guardian Alto saw you. You refused to protect two Moroi - including the one whose protection you were specifically assigned to.\"\\n\\n \"I didn\u0027t refuse!\" I exclaimed. \"I... fumbled.\"\\n\\n \"That wasn\u0027t a fumble,\" said Stan from the watchers. He glanced at Alberta for permission to speak. \"May I?\" She nodded, and he turned back to me. \"If you\u0027d blocked or attacked me and then messed up, that would be a fumble. But you didn\u0027t block. You didn\u0027t attack. You didn\u0027t even try. You just stood there like a statue and did nothing.\"\\n\\n Understandably, I was outraged. The thought that I would purposely leave Christian and Brandon to be \"killed\" by a Strigoi was ridiculous. But what could I do? I either confessed to screwing up majorly or to having seen a ghost. Neither option was appealing, but I had to cut my losses. One made me look incompetent. The other made me look insane. I didn\u0027t want to be associated with either of those. I much preferred my usual description of \"reckless\" and \"disruptive.\"\\n\\n \"Why am I getting in trouble for messing up?\" I asked tightly. \"I mean, I saw Ryan mess up earlier. He didn\u0027t get in trouble. Isn\u0027t that the point of this whole exercise? Practice? If we were perfect, you\u0027d already have unleashed us upon the world!\"\\n\\n \"Weren\u0027t you listening?\" said Stan. I swore I could see a vein throbbing in his forehead. I think he was the only one there as upset as I was. At the very least, he was the only one (aside from me) showing his emotions. The others wore poker faces, but then, none of them had witnessed what had happened. If I\u0027d been in Stan\u0027s place, I might have thought the worst of me too. \"You didn\u0027t mess up, because \u0027messing up\u0027 implies that you have to actually do something.\"\\n\\n \"Okay, then. I froze.\" I looked at him defiantly. \"Does that count as messing up? I cracked under the pressure and blanked out. It turns out I wasn\u0027t prepared. The moment came, and I panicked. It happens to novices all the time.\"\\n\\n \"To a novice who has already killed Strigoi?\" asked Emil. He was from Romania, his accent a bit thicker than Dimitri\u0027s Russian one. It wasn\u0027t nearly as nice, though. \"It seems unlikely.\"\\n\\n I dealt out glares to him and everyone else in the room. \"Oh, I see. After one incident, I\u0027m now expected to be an expert Strigoi killer? I can\u0027t panic or be afraid or anything? Makes sense. Thanks, guys. Fair. Real fair.\" I slumped back in my seat, arms crossed over my chest. There was no need to fake bitchy defiance. I had plenty of it to dish out.\\n\\n Alberta sighed and leaned forward. \"We\u0027re arguing semantics. Technicalities aren\u0027t the point here. What\u0027s important is that this morning, you made it very clear you did not want to guard Christian Ozera. In fact ... I think you even said you wanted us to be sure we knew that you were doing it against your will and that we\u0027d soon see what a horrible idea it was.\" Ugh. I had said that. Honestly, what had I been thinking? \"And then, when your first test comes around, we find you completely and utterly unresponsive.\"\\n\\n I nearly flew out of my chair. \"That\u0027s what this is about? You think I didn\u0027t protect him because of some kind of weird revenge thing?\"\\n\\n All three of them stared at me expectantly.\\n\\n \"You aren\u0027t exactly known for calmly and gracefully accepting things you don\u0027t like,\" she replied wryly.\\n\\n This time, I did stand up, pointing my finger at her accusingly. \"Not true. I have followed every rule Kirova laid down for me since coming back here. I\u0027ve gone to every practice and obeyed every curfew.\" Well, I\u0027d fudged some of the curfews but not willfully. It had always been for the greater good. \"There\u0027s no reason I\u0027d do this as some kind of revenge! What good would it do? Sta - Guardian Alto wasn\u0027t going to really hurt Christian, so it\u0027s not like I\u0027d get to see him punched or anything. The only thing I would accomplish is getting dragged into the middle of something like this and possibly facing removal from the field experience.\"\\n\\n \"You are facing removal from the field experience,\" replied Celeste flatly.\\n\\n \"Oh.\" I sat down, suddenly not feeling as bold. Silence hung in the room for several moments, and then I heard Dimitri\u0027s voice speak from behind me.\\n\\n \"She has a point,\" he said. My heart thumped loudly in my chest. Dimitri knew I wouldn\u0027t take revenge like that. He didn\u0027t think I was petty. \"If she were going to protest or take revenge, she\u0027d do it in a different way.\" Well, not too petty, at least.\\n\\n Celeste frowned. \"Yes, but after the scene she made this morning...\"\\n\\n Dimitri took a few steps forward and stood beside my chair. Having his solid presence nearby comforted me. I had a flash of d¨¦j¨¤ vu, back to when Lissa and I had returned to the Academy last autumn. Headmistress Kirova had nearly expelled me, and Dimitri had stood up for me then too.\\n\\n \"This is all circumstantial,\" he said. \"Regardless of how suspicious you think it looks, there\u0027s no proof. Removing her from the experience - and essentially ruining her graduation - is a bit extreme without any certainties.\"\\n\\n The committee looked thoughtful, and I focused my attention on Alberta. She had the most power here. I\u0027d always liked her, and in our time together, she\u0027d been strict but always scrupulously fair. I hoped that would still hold true. She beckoned Celeste and Emil toward her, and the other two guardians leaned closer. They had a whispered conference. Alberta gave a resigned nod, and the others leaned back.\\n\\n \"Miss Hathaway, do you have anything you\u0027d like to say before we tell you our conclusions?\"\\n\\n That I\u0027d like to say? Hell, yeah. There were tons of things. I wanted to say that I wasn\u0027t incompetent. I wanted to tell them that I was one of the best novices here. I wanted to tell them that I had seen Stan coming and had been on the verge of reacting. I especially wanted to tell them that I didn\u0027t want to have this mark on my record. Even if I stayed in the field experience, I\u0027d essentially have an F for this first test. It would affect my overall grade, which could subsequently affect my future.\\n\\n But again, what choice did I have? Tell them that I\u0027d seen a ghost? The ghost of a guy who\u0027d had a major crush on me and who had quite likely died because of that crush? I still didn\u0027t know what was going on with these sightings. One time I could write off to exhaustion...but I\u0027d seen him - or it - twice now. Was he real? My higher reasoning said no, but honestly, it didn\u0027t matter at the moment. If he was real and I told them, they\u0027d think I was crazy. If he wasn\u0027t real and I told them, they\u0027d think I was crazy - and they\u0027d be right. I couldn\u0027t win here.\\n\\n \"No, Guardian Petrov,\" I said, hoping I sounded meek. \"Nothing more to add.\"\\n\\n \"All right,\" she said wearily. \"Here\u0027s what we\u0027ve decided. You\u0027re lucky you have Guardian Belikov to advocate for you, or this decision might have been different. We\u0027re giving you the benefit of the doubt. You\u0027ll go on with the field experience and continue to guard Mr. Ozera. You\u0027ll just be on a probation of sorts.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s okay,\" I said. I\u0027d been on probation for most of my academic life. \"Thank you.\"\\n\\n \"And,\" she added. Uh-oh. \"Because the suspicion isn\u0027t entirely removed, you\u0027ll be spending your day off this week doing community service.\"\\n\\n I jumped out of my chair again. \"What?\"\\n\\n Dimitri\u0027s hand wrapped around my wrist, his fingers warm and controlling. \"Sit down,\" he murmured in my ear, tugging me toward the chair. \"Take what you can get.\"\\n\\n \"If that\u0027s a problem, we can make it next week too,\" warned Celeste. \"And the next five after that.\"\\n\\n I sat down and shook my head. \"I\u0027m sorry. Thank you.\"\\n\\n The hearing dispersed, and I was left feeling weary and beaten. Had only one day gone by? Surely the happy excitement I\u0027d felt before the field experience had been weeks ago and not this morning. Alberta told me to go find Christian, but Dimitri asked if he could have some time alone with me. She agreed, no doubt hoping he\u0027d set me on the straight and narrow.\\n\\n The room emptied, and I thought he\u0027d sit and talk to me then and there, but instead he walked over to a small table that held a water dispenser, coffee, and other beverages.\\n\\n \"You want some hot chocolate?\" he asked.\\n\\n I hadn\u0027t expected that. \"Sure.\"\\n\\n He dumped four packets of instant hot chocolate into two Styrofoam cups and then added in hot water.\\n\\n \"Doubling it is the secret,\" he said when the cups were full.\\n\\n He handed me mine, along with a wooden stirrer, and then walked toward a side door. Presuming I was supposed to follow him, I scurried to catch up without spilling my hot chocolate.\\n\\n \"Where are we - oh.\"\\n\\n I stepped through the doorway and found myself in a little glass-enclosed porch filled with small patio tables. I\u0027d had no idea this porch was adjacent to the meeting room, but then, this was the building the guardians conducted all campus business out of. Novices were rarely allowed. I also hadn\u0027t realized the building was built around a small courtyard, which was what this porch looked out to. In the summer, I imagined one could open the windows and be surrounded in greenery and warm air. Now, encased in glass and frost, I felt like I was in some kind of an ice palace.\\n\\n Dimitri swept his hand over a chair, brushing off dust. I did the same and sat down opposite him. Apparently this room didn\u0027t see a lot of use in the winter. Because it was enclosed, the room was warmer than outdoors, but it wasn\u0027t heated otherwise. The air felt chilly, and I warmed my hands on my cup. Silence fell between Dimitri and me. The only noise came from me blowing on my hot chocolate. He drank his right away. He\u0027d been killing Strigoi for years. What was a little scalding water here and there?\\n\\n As we sat, and the quiet grew, I studied him over the edge of my cup. He wasn\u0027t looking at me, but I knew he knew I was watching. Like every other time I looked at him, I was always struck by his looks first. The soft dark hair that he often tucked behind his ears without realizing it, hair that never quite wanted to stay in its tie at the back of his neck. His eyes were brown too, somehow gentle and fierce at the same time. His lips had that same contradictory quality, I realized. When he was fighting or dealing with something grim, those lips would flatten and turn hard. But in lighter times ... when he laughed or kissed...well, then they\u0027d become soft and wonderful.\\n\\n Today, more than his exterior hit me. I felt warm and safe just being with him. He brought comfort after my terrible day. So often with other people, I felt a need to be the center of attention, to be funny and always have something clever to say. It was a habit I needed to shake to be a guardian, seeing as that job required so much silence. But with Dimitri, I never felt like I had to be anything more than what I already was. I didn\u0027t have to entertain him or think up jokes or even flirt. It was enough to just be together, to be so completely comfortable in each other\u0027s presence - smoldering sexual tension aside - that we lost all sense of self-consciousness. I exhaled and drank my cocoa.\\n\\n \"What happened out there?\" he asked at last, meeting my gaze. \"You didn\u0027t crack under the pressure.\"\\n\\n His voice was curious, not accusatory. He wasn\u0027t treating me as a student right now, I realized. He was regarding me as an equal. He simply wanted to know what was going on with me. There was no discipline or lecturing here.\\n\\n And that just made it all the worse when I had to lie to him.\\n\\n \"Of course it was,\" I told him, looking down into my cup. \"Unless you believe I really did let Stan \u0027attack\u0027 Christian.\"\\n\\n \"No,\" he said. \"I don\u0027t believe that. I never did. I knew you\u0027d be unhappy when you found out about the assignments, but I never once doubted that you\u0027d do what you\u0027d have to for this. I knew you wouldn\u0027t let your personal feelings get in the way of your duty.\"\\n\\n I looked up again and met his eyes, so full of faith and absolute confidence in me. \"I didn\u0027t. I was mad...Still am a little. But once I said I\u0027d do it, I meant it. And after spending some time with him...well, I don\u0027t hate him. I actually think he\u0027s good for Lissa, and he cares about her, so I can\u0027t get upset about that. He and I just clash sometimes, that\u0027s all... but we did really well together against the Strigoi. I remembered that while I was with him today, and arguing against this assignment just seemed stupid. So I decided to do the best job I could.\" I hadn\u0027t meant to talk so much, but it felt good to let out what was inside of me, and the look on Dimitri\u0027s face would have gotten me to say anything. Almost anything.\\n\\n \"What happened then?\" he asked. \"With Stan?\" I averted my eyes and played with my cup again. I hated keeping things from him, but I couldn\u0027t tell him about this. In the human world, vampires and dhampirs were creatures of myth and legend - bedtime stories to scare children. Humans didn\u0027t know we were real and walking the earth. But just because we were real didn\u0027t mean that every other story-time paranormal creature was. We knew that and had our own myths and bedtime stories about things we didn\u0027t believe in. Werewolves. Bogeymen. Ghosts.\\n\\n Ghosts played no real role in our culture, short of being fodder for pranks and campfire tales. Ghosts inevitably came up on Halloween, and some legends endured over the years. But in real life? No ghosts. If you came back after death, it was because you were a Strigoi.\\n\\n At least, that\u0027s what I\u0027d always been taught. I honestly didn\u0027t know enough now to say what was going on. Me imagining Mason seemed more likely than him being a true ghost, but man, that meant I might seriously be heading into crazy territory. All this time I\u0027d worried about Lissa losing it. Who had known it might be me?\\n\\n Dimitri was still watching me, waiting for an answer.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know what happened out there. My intentions were good ... I just... I just messed up.\"\\n\\n \"Rose. You\u0027re a terrible liar.\"\\n\\n I glanced up. \"No, I\u0027m not. I\u0027ve told a lot of good lies in my life. People have believed them.\"\\n\\n He smiled slightly. \"I\u0027m sure. But it doesn\u0027t work with me. For one thing, you won\u0027t look me in the eye. As for the other... I don\u0027t know. I can just tell.\"\\n\\n Damn. He could tell. He just knew me that well. I stood up and moved to the door, keeping my back to him. Normally, I treasured every minute with him, but I couldn\u0027t stick around today. I hated lying, but I didn\u0027t want to tell the truth either. I had to leave.\\n\\n \"Look, I appreciate you being worried about me...but really, it\u0027s okay. I just messed up. I\u0027m embarrassed about it - and sorry I put your awesome training to shame - but I\u0027ll rebound. Next time, Stan\u0027s ass is mine.\"\\n\\n I hadn\u0027t even heard him get up, but suddenly, Dimitri was right behind me. He placed a hand on my shoulder, and I froze in front of the door leading out. He didn\u0027t touch me anywhere else. He didn\u0027t try to pull me closer. But, oh, that one hand on my shoulder held all the power in the world.\\n\\n \"Rose,\" he said, and I knew he was no longer smiling. \"I don\u0027t know why you\u0027re lying, but I know you wouldn\u0027t do it without a good reason. And if there\u0027s something wrong - something you\u0027re afraid to tell the others - \"\\n\\n I spun around rapidly, somehow managing to pivot in place in such a way that his hand never moved yet ended up on my other shoulder.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not afraid,\" I cried. \"I do have my reasons, and believe me, what happened with Stan was nothing. Really. All of this is just something stupid that got blown out of proportion. Don\u0027t feel sorry for me or feel like you have to do anything. What happened sucks, but I\u0027ll just roll with it and take the black mark. I\u0027ll take care of everything. I\u0027ll take care of me.\" It took all of my strength just then not to shake. How had this day gotten so bizarre and out of control?\\n\\n Dimitri didn\u0027t say anything. He just looked down at me, and the expression on his face was one I\u0027d never seen before. I couldn\u0027t interpret it. Was he mad? Disapproving? I just couldn\u0027t tell. The fingers on my shoulder tightened slightly and then relaxed.\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t have to do this alone,\" he said at last. He sounded almost wistful, which made no sense. He was the one who\u0027d been telling me for so long that I needed to be strong. I wanted to throw myself into his arms just then, but I knew I couldn\u0027t.\\n\\n I couldn\u0027t help a smile. \"You say that...but tell me the truth. Do you go running to others when you have problems?\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s the not the same - \"\\n\\n \"Answer the question, comrade.\"\\n\\n \"Don\u0027t call me that.\"\\n\\n \"And don\u0027t avoid the question either.\"\\n\\n \"No,\" he said. \"I try to deal with my problems on my own.\"\\n\\n I slipped away from his hand. \"See?\"\\n\\n \"But you have a lot of people in your life you can trust, people who care about you. That changes things.\"\\n\\n I looked at him in surprise. \"You don\u0027t have people who care about you?\"\\n\\n He frowned, obviously rethinking his words. \"Well, I\u0027ve always had good people in my life...and there have been people who cared about me. But that doesn\u0027t necessarily mean I could trust them or tell them everything.\"\\n\\n I was often so distracted by the weirdness of our relationship that I rarely thought about Dimitri as someone with a life away from me. He was respected by everyone on campus. Teachers and students alike knew him as one of the deadliest guardians here. Whenever we ran into guardians from outside the school, they always seemed to know and respect him too. But I couldn\u0027t recall ever having seen him in any sort of social setting. He didn\u0027t appear to have any close friends among the other guardians - just coworkers he liked. The friendliest I\u0027d ever seen him get with someone had been when Christian\u0027s aunt, Tasha Ozera, visited. They\u0027d known each other for a long time, but even that hadn\u0027t been enough for Dimitri to pursue once her visit was over.\\n\\n Dimitri was alone an awful lot, I realized, content to hole up with his cowboy novels when not working. I felt alone a lot, but in truth, I was almost always surrounded by people. With him being my teacher, I tended to view things as one-sided: He was the one always giving me something, be it advice or instruction. But I gave him something too, something harder to define - a connection with another person.\\n\\n \"Do you trust me?\" I asked him.\\n\\n The hesitation was brief. \"Yes.\"\\n\\n \"Then trust me now, and don\u0027t worry about me just this once.\"\\n\\n I stepped away, out of the reach of his arm, and he didn\u0027t say anything more or try to stop me. Cutting through the room that I\u0027d had the hearing in, I headed for the building\u0027s main exit, tossing the remnants of my hot chocolate in a garbage can as I walked past. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/shadow-kiss-vampire-academy-3/page-5.html","bookId":2062,"book":{"id":2062,"title":"Shadow Kiss (Vampire Academy #3)","description":"Storyline: Vampire Academy Series 3: Shadow Kiss \\n A little background...
