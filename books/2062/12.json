{"id":110689,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"TWELVE IF YOU\u0027D ASKED ME six months ago, I would have said there was no way I\u0027d be happy to run into Mia Rinaldi at the Royal Court. She was a year younger than me and had held a grudge against Lissa since freshman year - a grudge so big that Mia had gone to great extremes to make life miserable for us. She\u0027d done a good job. Jesse and Ralf\u0027s rumors about me had been a result of her efforts. But then Mia had gone with us to Spokane and been captured by the Strigoi. And, just like for Christian and Eddie, that had changed everything. She\u0027d seen the same horrors the rest of us had. In fact, she was the only one of my friends who had witnessed Mason\u0027s death and me killing Strigoi. She had even saved my life then by using her water magic to temporarily drown one of the Strigoi. In the great Moroi argument about whether or not they should learn to fight with the guardians, she was firmly on the fighting side. I hadn\u0027t seen Mia in almost a month, ever since Mason\u0027s funeral. In studying her, I felt like it\u0027d been a year. I had always thought Mia looked like a doll. She was short compared to most Moroi and had young, round-cheeked features. The fact that she\u0027d always curled her hair in perfect ringlets had sort of reinforced that image. But today, she hadn\u0027t gone to nearly that much trouble. Her golden blond hair was pulled into a ponytail, its only curl coming from a slight, natural waviness. She wore no makeup, and her face showed signs of having been outdoors a lot. Her skin looked chapped from the wind, and she had a very, very faint tan - almost unheard of for Moroi, with their aversion to sunlight. For the first time ever, she actually looked her age. She laughed at my shock. \"Come on, it hasn\u0027t been that long. You look like you don\u0027t even recognize me.\" \"I almost don\u0027t.\" We hugged, and again, it was hard to believe that she\u0027d once plotted ways to ruin my life. Or that I\u0027d broken her nose. \"What are you doing here?\" She beckoned us out the door. \"We were just about to leave. I\u0027ll explain everything.\" We went to a neighboring building. It wasn\u0027t like a mall or anything, but it did have a few businesses that the Moroi who worked and visited here needed - a handful of restaurants, some small stores, and offices that offered all sorts of services. There was also a coffee shop, and that was where Mia led us. A coffee shop seems like an ordinary thing, but I rarely got to go to them. Sitting in a public place (or semi-public) with friends, not worrying about school... it was great. It reminded me of when Lissa and I had been on our own, when our entire lives hadn\u0027t been contained within a school and its rules. \"My dad works here now,\" she told us. \"And so now I live here.\" Moroi children rarely lived with their parents. They were sent off to places like St. Vladimir\u0027s, where they could grow up safely. \"What about school?\" I asked. \"There aren\u0027t many kids here, but there are some. Most of them are rich and have personal tutors. My dad pulled some strings and set it up so that I can go to them for different subjects. So I\u0027m still studying the same things, just in a different way. It\u0027s actually pretty cool. Less teacher time - but more homework.\" \"You\u0027ve been doing more than that,\" said Eddie. \"Unless your classes are outside.\" He\u0027d noticed the same things I had, and in looking at her hands as they held her latte, I could now see calluses. She wiggled her fingers. \"I made friends with some of the guardians here. They\u0027ve been showing me a few things.\" \"That\u0027s risky,\" said Christian, though he sounded like he approved. \"Since there\u0027s still a debate about Moroi fighting.\" \"You mean about Moroi fighting with magic,\" she corrected. \"That\u0027s what\u0027s controversial. No one\u0027s really talking about Moroi fighting hand-to-hand.\" \"Well, they are,\" I said. \"It\u0027s just been overshadowed by the magic controversy.\" \"It\u0027s not illegal,\" she said primly. \"And until it is, I\u0027m going to keep doing it. You think with all the events and meetings that go on around here that anyone even notices what someone like me does?\" Mia\u0027s family, in addition to being non-royal, was also pretty lower class - not that there was anything wrong with that, but she had to feel the effects of that around here. Still, I found her whole situation cheering. Mia seemed happier and more open than she had during the entire time I\u0027d known her. She seemed ... free. Christian spoke my thoughts before I could. \"You\u0027ve changed,\" he said. \"We\u0027ve all changed,\" she corrected. \"Especially you, Rose. I can\u0027t quite explain it.\" \"I don\u0027t think there\u0027s any way the five of us couldn\u0027t have changed,\" Christian pointed out. A moment later he corrected himself. \"Four of us.\" We all fell silent, thoughts of Mason weighing us down. Being with Christian, Eddie, and Mia stirred up that grief I always tried to hide, and I could see from their faces that they continually fought the same battle. Conversation eventually turned toward all of us catching up on what had happened here and at the Academy. Yet I kept thinking about how Mia had said that I had changed more than the others. All I could think about was how out of control I\u0027d felt lately, how half the time my actions and feelings didn\u0027t seem like my own. Sitting there, it almost seemed like Mia was controlled by all of her positive traits now - and I was controlled by my negative ones. Conversations with Adrian replayed through my head, reminding me about how I supposedly had such a dark, dark aura. Maybe thinking about him summoned him, but he and Lissa eventually joined us. Their bar was probably in the same building, I realized. I\u0027d been blocking her out and not paying much attention. Adrian hadn\u0027t completely gotten her drunk, thankfully, but she\u0027d agreed to two drinks. I could feel a slight buzz through the bond and had to carefully shield it out. She was as surprised as we\u0027d been to see Mia but gave her a warm welcome and wanted to catch up. I\u0027d heard most of this already, so I just listened and drank my chai. No coffee for me. Most guardians drank it the way Moroi drank blood, but I wouldn\u0027t touch the stuff. \"How\u0027d your thing with the queen go?\" Christian asked Lissa at one point. \"Not so bad,\" she said. \"I mean, not great either. But she didn\u0027t yell at me or humiliate me, so that\u0027s a start.\" \"Stop being modest,\" said Adrian, putting his arm around her. \"Princess Dragomir totally stood her ground. You should have seen it.\" Lissa laughed. \"I don\u0027t suppose she mentioned why she decided to let us come to the trial?\" Christian asked stiffly. He didn\u0027t look very happy about the bonding that was taking place here - or about Adrian\u0027s arm. Lissa\u0027s laughter faded, but she was still smiling. \"Adrian did it.\" \"What?\" Christian and I asked together. Adrian, looking very pleased with himself, stayed quiet for a change and let Lissa do the talking. \"He convinced her that we needed to be here. He apparently harassed her until she gave in.\" \"It\u0027s called \u0027persuasion,\u0027 not \u0027harassment,\u0027\" Adrian said. Lissa laughed again. My own words about the queen came back to haunt me. Who\u0027s she? Just another Ivashkov. There are a ton of them. There were indeed. I eyed Adrian. \"How closely are you guys related?\" The answer popped into my head from Lissa\u0027s. \"She\u0027s your aunt.\" \"Great-aunt. And I\u0027m her favorite great nephew. Well, I\u0027m her only great nephew, but that\u0027s not important. I\u0027d still be her favorite,\" he said. \"Unbelievable,\" said Christian. \"I\u0027ll second that,\" I said. \"None of you appreciate me. Why is it so hard to believe that I could make a real contribution in these dark times?\" Adrian stood up. He was trying to sound outraged, but the smirk on his face indicated that he still found all of this pretty funny. \"My cigarettes and I are going outside. At least they show me respect.\" As soon as he left, Christian asked Lissa, \"Were you getting drunk with him?\" \"I\u0027m not drunk. I only had two drinks,\" she said. \"Since when did you get all conservative?\" \"Since Adrian became a bad influence.\" \"Come on! He helped us get here. No one else was able to do it. He didn\u0027t have to, but he did. And you and Rose are sitting there, still acting like he\u0027s the most evil person on the planet.\" That wasn\u0027t exactly true. I was mostly sitting there like I had been hit in the head, still too dumbstruck to react. \"Yeah, and I\u0027m sure he did it out of the kindness of his heart,\" muttered Christian. \"Why else would he do it?\" \"Oh, gee, I wonder.\" Lissa\u0027s eyes widened. \"You think he did it for me? You think there\u0027s something going on with us?\" \"You guys drink together, practice magic together, and go to elitist events together. What would you think?\" Mia and Eddie looked like they wanted to be somewhere else. I was starting to share the feeling. Anger burned through Lissa, hitting me like a wave of heat. She was utterly outraged. Her fury didn\u0027t even have that much to do with Adrian, really. She was more upset at the thought of Christian not trusting her. And as for him, I needed no psychic powers to understand how he was feeling. He wasn\u0027t jealous simply because she was hanging out with Adrian. Christian was still jealous that Adrian had the kind of influence to pull this off for her. It was just like what Jesse and Ralf had described, about how the right connections could open the right doors - connections that Christian didn\u0027t have. I kneed Christian\u0027s leg, hoping he\u0027d get the hint that he really should stop talking before things got worse. Lissa\u0027s anger was intensifying, muddled with embarrassment as she began to doubt herself and wonder if she had been getting too close to Adrian. The whole thing was ridiculous. \"Christian, for the love of God. If Adrian did this for anyone, it was because of me and his crazy obsession. He bragged awhile ago that he could do it, and I didn\u0027t believe it.\" I turned to Lissa. I needed to get her calm and diffuse those dark feelings that could cause so much trouble for her when they ran out of control. \"Liss, you might not be wasted exactly, but you need to chill out for an hour before having this conversation. You\u0027re going to say something as stupid as Christian, and I\u0027ll be the one who has to deal with the mess - like always.\" I\u0027d gotten worked up and expected someone to tell me how bitchy I sounded. Instead, Lissa relaxed and offered Christian a smile. \"Yeah, we should definitely talk about this later. A lot\u0027s kind of happened today.\" He hesitated, then nodded. \"Yeah. Sorry I jumped all over you.\" He returned her smile, fight patched up. \"So,\" Lissa asked Mia, \"who have you met here?\" I stared at them in amazement, but no one seemed to notice. I\u0027d fixed their fight, and there\u0027d been no acknowledgment. No Thank you, Rose, for pointing out how idiotic we\u0027re being. It was bad enough I had to endure their romance day after day, with no consideration for how I felt. Now I was salvaging their relationship, and they didn\u0027t even realize it. \"I\u0027ll be right back,\" I said, interrupting Mia\u0027s description of some of the other teenagers here. I was afraid if I sat there, I was going to say something I\u0027d regret or maybe break a chair. Where had this rage come from? I went outside, hoping a gulp of cold air would calm me down. Instead, I got a face full of clove smoke. \"Don\u0027t start in about the smoking,\" warned Adrian. He was leaning against the building\u0027s brick wall. \"You didn\u0027t have to come outside. You knew I was here.\" \"That\u0027s actually why I\u0027m here. Well, that, and I felt like I was going to go crazy if I stayed inside another minute.\" He tilted his head to look at my face. His eyebrows shot up. \"You aren\u0027t kidding, are you? What happened? You were fine a few minutes ago.\" I paced across the ground in front of him. \"I don\u0027t know. I was fine. Then Christian and Lissa started having this stupid argument over you. It was weird. They were the ones who were mad - and then I ended up madder than both of them.\" \"Wait. They were arguing over me?\" \"Yes. I just said that. Weren\u0027t you paying attention?\" \"Hey, don\u0027t snap at me. I haven\u0027t done anything to you.\" I crossed my arms over my chest. \"Christian\u0027s jealous because you hang around Lissa so much.\" \"We\u0027re studying spirit,\" said Adrian. \"He\u0027s welcome to join in.\" \"Yeah, well, no one ever said love was reasonable. Seeing you come back together kind of set him off. And then he got upset because you pulled rank with the queen for Lissa.\" \"I didn\u0027t do it for her. I did it for all of you - but, well, you especially.\" I came to a halt in front of him. \"I didn\u0027t believe you. That you could do it.\" He grinned. \"Guess you should have listened to my family history in that dream after all.\" \"I guess. I just thought...\" I couldn\u0027t finish. I\u0027d thought Dimitri would be the one who came through for me, the one who - despite what he said - could make almost anything happen. But he hadn\u0027t. \"Thought what?\" Adrian prompted. \"Nothing.\" With much effort, I managed to utter the next words. \"Thank you for helping us.\" \"Oh my God,\" he said. \"A kind word from Rose Hathaway. I can die a happy man.\" \"What are you saying? That I\u0027m normally an ungrateful bitch?\" He just looked at me. \"Hey! Not cool.\" \"Maybe you could redeem yourself with a hug.\" I glared. \"A small one?\" he begged. With a sigh, I walked over and put one arm around Adrian, leaning my head lightly against his arm. \"Thanks, Adrian.\" We stood like that for a heartbeat. I felt none of the crazy electricity or connection I did with Dimitri, but I had to admit that Lissa had been right about something. Adrian was annoying and arrogant at times, but he really wasn\u0027t the bastard I often made him out to be. The doors opened, and Lissa and the others stepped outside. They understandably looked surprised, but I didn\u0027t care just then. Besides, they probably all thought I was pregnant with Adrian\u0027s love child, so what did it matter? I backed away. \"Heading out?\" I asked. \"Yeah, Mia\u0027s got more important things to do than hang out with us,\" joked Christian. \"Hey, I just told my dad I\u0027d meet him. I\u0027ll see you guys before I leave.\" She started to walk away, then abruptly turned around. \"God, I\u0027m so out of it.\" She reached into her coat pocket and handed me a folded piece of paper. \"This is half the reason I found you guys. One of the court clerks wanted me to give this to you.\" \"Thanks,\" I said, puzzled. She headed off to see her dad while the rest of us strolled back to our accommodations. I slowed my pace as I opened the note, wondering who in the world here would want to contact me. Rose, I was so happy to hear about your arrival. I\u0027m sure it\u0027ll make tomorrow\u0027s proceedings that much more entertaining. I\u0027ve been curious for quite some time about how Vasilisa is doing, and your romantic escapades are always an amusing diversion. I can\u0027t wait to share them in the courtroom tomorrow. Best, V.D. \"Who\u0027s it from?\" asked Eddie, coming up beside me. I hastily folded it up and shoved it into my pocket. \"No one,\" I replied. No one indeed. V. D. Victor Dashkov.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/shadow-kiss-vampire-academy-3/page-12.html","bookId":2062,"book":{"id":2062,"title":"Shadow Kiss (Vampire Academy #3)","description":"Storyline: Vampire Academy Series 3: Shadow Kiss A little background... I am in my mid 20\u0027s and a high school teacher who loves to read when I can but doesn\u0027t get much time to do it in. I picked up the twilight series a year ago at a students request and was pleasantly surprised. Once the series was finished I needed another one! Before Twilight I had not been into teen romance/ fantasy books especially with vampires and such. I saw a book-list of recommendations by Twilight followers and picked up the \"House of Night\" series by PC Cast. This was worth reading and I am waiting for the next book to come. My husband now calls me addicted to Vamps since I started looking for a new series to pick up. I was strongly recommended to pick up the Vampire Academy series by my 20 year old sister who has always been a fan of this genre of books.","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/shadow-kiss-vampire-academy-3.jpg","author":"Richelle Mead","type":"Fantasy","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/shadow-kiss-vampire-academy-3.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:18 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:03:18 AM"}}
