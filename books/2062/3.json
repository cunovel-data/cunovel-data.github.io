I sighed. \"Adrian, you are the last person I want to see right now.\" Adrian Ivashkov hurried up beside me, blowing a cloud of smoke into the air that of course drifted right toward me. I waved it off and made a great show of exaggerated coughing. Adrian was a royal Moroi we\u0027d \"acquired\" on our recent ski trip. He was a few years older than me and had come back to St. Vladimir\u0027s to work on learning spirit with Lissa. So far, he was the only other spirit user we knew of. He was arrogant and spoiled and spent a lot of his time indulging in cigarettes, alcohol, and women. He also had a crush on me - or at least wanted to get me into bed.\\n\\n \"Apparently,\" he said. \"I\u0027ve hardly seen you at all since we got back. If I didn\u0027t know better, I\u0027d say you were avoiding me.\"\\n\\n \"I am avoiding you.\"\\n\\n He exhaled loudly and raked a hand through the sable brown hair he always kept stylishly messy. \"Look, Rose. You don\u0027t have to keep up with the hard-to-get thing. You\u0027ve already got me.\"\\n\\n Adrian knew perfectly well I wasn\u0027t playing hard-to-get, but he always took a particular delight in teasing me. \"I\u0027m really not in the mood for your so-called charm today.\"\\n\\n \"What happened, then? You\u0027re stomping through every puddle you can find and look like you\u0027re going to punch the first person you see.\"\\n\\n \"Why are you hanging around, then? Aren\u0027t you worried about getting hit?\"\\n\\n \"Aw, you\u0027d never hurt me. My face is too pretty.\"\\n\\n \"Not pretty enough to make up for the gross, carcinogenic smoke blowing in my face. How can you do that? Smoking\u0027s not allowed on campus. Abby Badica got two weeks\u0027 detention when she got caught.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m above the rules, Rose. I\u0027m neither student nor staff, merely a free spirit wandering your fair school as I will.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe you should go do some wandering now.\"\\n\\n \"You want to get rid of me, you tell me what\u0027s going on.\"\\n\\n There was no avoiding it. Besides, he\u0027d know soon enough. Everyone would know. \"I got assigned to Christian for my field experience.\"\\n\\n There was a pause, and then Adrian burst out laughing. \"Wow. Now I understand. In light of that, you actually seem remarkably calm.\"\\n\\n \"I was supposed to have Lissa,\" I growled. \"I can\u0027t believe they did this to me.\"\\n\\n \"Why did they do it? Is there some chance you might not be with her when you graduate?\"\\n\\n \"No. They just all seem to think this is going to help me train better now. Dimitri and I will still be her real guardians later.\"\\n\\n Adrian gave me a sidelong glance. \"Oh, I\u0027m sure that\u0027ll be quite the hardship for you.\"\\n\\n It had to be one of the weirdest things in the universe that Lissa had never come close to suspecting my feelings for Dimitri but that Adrian had figured it out.\\n\\n \"Like I said, your commentary isn\u0027t appreciated today.\"\\n\\n He apparently didn\u0027t agree. I had a suspicious feeling he\u0027d been drinking already, and it was barely even lunchtime. \"What\u0027s the problem? Christian\u0027ll be with Lissa all the time anyway.\"\\n\\n Adrian had a point. Not that I\u0027d have admitted it. Then, in that short-attention-span way of his, he switched subjects just as we neared the building.\\n\\n \"Have I mentioned your aura to you?\" he asked suddenly. There was a strange note to his voice. Hesitant. Curious. It was very uncharacteristic. Everything he usually said was mocking.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know. Yeah, once. You said it was dark or something. Why?\" Auras were fields of light that surrounded every person. Their colors and brightness were allegedly linked to a person\u0027s personality and energy. Only spirit users could see them. Adrian had been doing it for as long as he could remember, but Lissa was still learning.\\n\\n \"Hard to explain. Maybe it\u0027s nothing.\" He came to a stop near the door and inhaled deeply on his cigarette. He went out of his way to blow a cloud of smoke away from me, but the wind carried it back. \"Auras are strange. They ebb and flow and change colors and brightness. Some are vivid, some are pale. Every once in a while, someone\u0027s will settle and burn with such a pure color that you can...\" He tipped his head back, staring into the sky. I recognized the signs of that weird \"unhinged\" state he sometimes fell into. \"You can instantly grasp what it means. It\u0027s like seeing into their soul.\"\\n\\n I smiled. \"But you haven\u0027t figured mine out, huh? Or what any of these colors mean?\"\\n\\n He shrugged. \"I\u0027m figuring it out. You talk to enough people, get a feel for what they\u0027re like and then start to see the same kinds of people with the same kinds of colors.... After a while, the colors start to mean something.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s mine look like right now?\"\\n\\n He glanced over at me. \"Eh, I can\u0027t quite get a fix on it today.\"\\n\\n \"I knew it. You\u0027ve been drinking.\" Substances, like alcohol or certain medications, numbed spirit\u0027s effects.\\n\\n \"Just enough to chase the chill away. I can guess what your aura\u0027s like, though. It\u0027s usually like the others, sort of those swirling colors - it\u0027s just kind of edged in darkness. Like you\u0027ve always got a shadow following you.\"\\n\\n Something in his voice made me shiver. Although I\u0027d heard him and Lissa talk about auras a lot, I\u0027d never really thought of them as anything I needed to worry about. They were more like some kind of stage trick - a cool thing with little substance.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s so cheerful,\" I said. \"You ever think about motivational speaking?\"\\n\\n His scattered look faded, and his normal mirth returned. \"Don\u0027t worry, little dhampir. You might be surrounded by clouds, but you\u0027ll always be like sunshine to me.\" I rolled my eyes. He dropped his cigarette onto the sidewalk and put it out with his foot. \"Gotta go. See you later.\" He swept me a gallant bow and started walking away toward guest housing.\\n\\n \"You just littered!\" I yelled.\\n\\n \"Above the rules, Rose,\" he called back. \"Above the rules.\"\\n\\n Shaking my head, I picked up the now-cold cigarette butt and took it to a garbage can that was outside the building. When I entered, the warmth inside was a welcome change as I shook off the slush on my boots. Down in the cafeteria, I found lunch wrapping up for the afternoon. Here, dhampirs sat side by side with Moroi, providing a study in contrasts. Dhampirs, with our half-human blood, were bigger - though not taller - and more solidly built. The girl novices were curvier than the ultra-slim Moroi girls, the boy novices far more muscular than their vampire counterparts. The Moroi complexions were pale and delicate, like porcelain, while ours were tanned from being outside in the sun so much.\\n\\n Lissa sat at a table by herself, looking serene and angelic in a white sweater. Her pale blond hair cascaded over her shoulders. She glanced up at my approach, and welcoming feelings flowed to me through our bond. She grinned. \"Oh, look at your face. It\u0027s true, isn\u0027t it? You really are assigned to Christian.\" I glared.\\n\\n \"Would it kill you to be a little less miserable?\" She gave me a censuring yet amused look as she licked the last of her strawberry yogurt off her spoon. \"I mean, he\u0027s my boyfriend, after all. I hang out with him all the time. It\u0027s not that bad.\"\\n\\n \"You have the patience of a saint,\" I grumbled, slouching into a chair. \"And besides, you don\u0027t hang out with him 24/7.\"\\n\\n \"Neither will you. It\u0027s only 24/6.\"\\n\\n \"Same difference. It might as well be 24/10.\"\\n\\n She frowned. \"That doesn\u0027t make any sense.\" I waved off my idiotic remark and stared blankly around the lunchroom. The room was buzzing with news of the impending field exercise, which would kick off as soon as lunch ended. Camille\u0027s best friend had gotten assigned to Ryan\u0027s best friend, and the four of them huddled gleefully together, looking as though they were about to embark on a six-week double date. At least someone would enjoy all this. I sighed. Christian, my soon-to-be charge, was off with the feeders - humans who willingly donated blood to Moroi.\\n\\n Through our bond, I sensed Lissa wanting to tell me something. She was holding off because she was worried about my bad mood and wanted to make sure I got enough support. I smiled. \"Stop worrying about me. What\u0027s up?\"\\n\\n She smiled back, her pink-glossed lips hiding her fangs. \"I got permission.\"\\n\\n \"Permission for - ?\" The answer flitted from her mind faster than she could have voiced it. \"What?\" I exclaimed. \"You\u0027re going to stop your meds?\"\\n\\n Spirit was an amazing power, one whose cool abilities we were just starting to figure out. It had a very nasty side effect, however: It could lead to depression and insanity. Part of the reason Adrian indulged in drinking so much (aside from his party nature) was to numb himself against these side effects. Lissa had a much healthier way of doing it. She took antidepressants, which completely cut her off from the magic altogether. She hated not being able to work with spirit anymore, but that was an acceptable trade-off for not going crazy. Well, I thought it was. She apparently disagreed if she was considering this insane experiment. I knew she\u0027d been wanting to try the magic again, but I hadn\u0027t really thought she\u0027d go through with it - or that anyone would let her.\\n\\n \"I have to check in with Ms. Carmack every day and regularly talk to a counselor.\" Lissa made a face at this last part, but her overall feelings were still quite upbeat. \"I can\u0027t wait to see what I can do with Adrian.\"\\n\\n \"Adrian\u0027s a bad influence.\"\\n\\n \"He didn\u0027t make me do this, Rose. I chose it.\" When I didn\u0027t answer, she lightly touched my arm. \"Hey, listen. Don\u0027t worry. I\u0027ve been so much better, and lots of people are going to have my back.\"\\n\\n \"Everyone except me,\" I told her wistfully. Across the room, Christian entered through a set of double doors and approached us. The clock read five minutes until the end of lunch. \"Oh man. The zero hour is almost here.\"\\n\\n Christian pulled up a chair at our table and flipped it backwards, letting his chin rest on its slatted back. He brushed his black hair away from his blue eyes and gave us a smug smile. I felt Lissa\u0027s heart lighten at his presence.\\n\\n \"I can\u0027t wait until this show gets on the road,\" he said. \"You and me are going to have so much fun, Rose. Picking out curtains, doing each other\u0027s hair, telling ghost stories \"\\n\\n The reference to \"ghost stories\" hit a little closer to home than I was comfortable with. Not that choosing curtains or brushing Christian\u0027s hair was much more appealing.\\n\\n I shook my head in exasperation and stood up. \"I\u0027ll leave you two alone for your last few private moments.\" They laughed.\\n\\n I walked over to the lunch line, hoping to find some leftover doughnuts from breakfast. So far, I could see croissants, quiche, and poached pears. It must have been highbrow day at the cafeteria. Was deep-fried dough really too much to ask for? Eddie stood in front of me. His face turned apologetic as soon as he saw me.\\n\\n \"Rose, I\u0027m really sorry - \"\\n\\n I put up a hand to stop him. \"Don\u0027t worry. It\u0027s not your fault. Just promise me you\u0027ll do a good job protecting her.\"\\n\\n It was a silly sentiment since she was in no real danger, but I could never really stop worrying about her - particularly in light of this new development with her medication.\\n\\n Eddie stayed serious, apparently not thinking my request was silly at all. He was one of the few who knew about Lissa\u0027s abilities - and their downsides, which was probably why he\u0027d been selected to guard her. \"I won\u0027t let anything happen to her. I mean it.\"\\n\\n I couldn\u0027t help a smile, in spite of my glum mood. His experiences with the Strigoi made him take all of this more seriously than almost any other novice. Aside from me, he was probably the best choice to guard her.\\n\\n \"Rose, is it true you punched Guardian Petrov?\"\\n\\n I turned and looked into the faces of two Moroi, Jesse Zeklos and Ralf Sarcozy. They\u0027d just stepped in line behind Eddie and me and looked more self-satisfied and annoying than usual. Jesse was all bronzed good looks and quick thinking. Ralf was his slightly less attractive and slightly less intelligent sidekick. They were quite possibly the two people I hated most at this school, mainly due to some nasty rumors they\u0027d spread about me doing some very explicit things with them. It was Mason\u0027s strong-arming that had forced them to tell the truth to the school, and I don\u0027t think they\u0027d ever forgiven me for that.\\n\\n \"Punch Alberta? Hardly.\" I started to turn around, but Ralf kept talking.\\n\\n \"We heard you threw a big hissy fit in the gym when you found out who you were with.\"\\n\\n \"\u0027Hissy fit\u0027? What are you, sixty? All I did was - \" I paused and carefully chose my words. \" - register my opinion.\"\\n\\n \"Well,\" said Jesse. \"I suppose if anyone\u0027s going to keep an eye on that Strigoi wannabe, it might as well be you. You\u0027re the biggest badass around here.\"\\n\\n The grudging tone in his voice made it sound like he was complimenting me. I didn\u0027t see it that way at all. Before he could utter another word, I was standing right in front of him, with barely any space between us. In what I considered a true sign of discipline, I didn\u0027t put my hand around his throat. His eyes widened in surprise.\\n\\n \"Christian has nothing to do with any Strigoi,\" I said in a low voice.\\n\\n \"His parents - \"\\n\\n \"Are his parents. And he\u0027s Christian. Don\u0027t confuse them.\" Jesse had been on the wrong side of my anger before. He was clearly remembering that, and his fear warred with his desire to trash-talk Christian in front of me. Surprisingly, the latter won out.\\n\\n \"Earlier you acted like being with him was the end of the world, and now you\u0027re defending him? You know how he is - he breaks rules all the time. Are you saying you seriously don\u0027t believe there\u0027s any chance at all he might turn Strigoi like his parents?\"\\n\\n \"None,\" I said. \"Absolutely none. Christian\u0027s more willing to take a stand against Strigoi than probably any other Moroi here.\" Jesse\u0027s eyes flicked curiously toward Ralf before returning to me. \"He even helped me fight against those ones in Spokane. There is no chance of him ever, ever turning Strigoi.\" I racked my brain, trying to recall who had been assigned to Jesse for the field experience. \"And if I hear you spreading that crap around, Dean isn\u0027t going to be able to save you from me.\"\\n\\n \"Or me,\" added Eddie, who had come to stand right beside me.\\n\\n Jesse swallowed and took a step back. \"You\u0027re such a liar. You can\u0027t lay a hand on me. If you get suspended now, you\u0027ll never graduate.\"\\n\\n He was right, of course, but I smiled anyway. \"Might be worth it. We\u0027ll have to see, huh?\"\\n\\n It was at that point that Jesse and Ralf decided they didn\u0027t want anything from the lunch line after all. They stalked off, and I heard something that sounded suspiciously like \"crazy bitch.\"\\n\\n \"Jerks,\" I muttered. Then I brightened. \"Oh, hey. Doughnuts.\"\\n\\n I got a chocolate-glazed, and then Eddie and I hurried off to find our Moroi and get to class. He grinned at me. \"If I didn\u0027t know any better, I\u0027d say you just defended Christian\u0027s honor. Isn\u0027t he a pain in the ass?\"\\n\\n \"Yes,\" I said, licking icing off my fingers. \"He is. But for the next six weeks, he\u0027s my pain in the ass.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/shadow-kiss-vampire-academy-3/page-3.html","bookId":2062,"book":{"id":2062,"title":"Shadow Kiss (Vampire Academy #3)","description":"Storyline: Vampire Academy Series 3: Shadow Kiss \\n A little background... I am in my mid 20\u0027s and a high school teacher who loves to read when I can but doesn\u0027t get much time to do it in. I picked up the twilight series a year ago at a students request and was pleasantly surprised. Once the series was finished I needed another one! Before Twilight I had not been into teen romance/ fantasy books especially with vampires and such. I saw a book-list of recommendations by Twilight followers and picked up the \"House of Night\" series by PC Cast. This was worth reading and I am waiting for the next book to come. My husband now calls me addicted to Vamps since I started looking for a new series to pick up. I was strongly recommended to pick up the Vampire Academy series by my 20 year old sister who has always been a fan of this genre of books.\\n","cover":"https://allnovel.net/images/shadow-kiss-vampire-academy-3.jpg","author":"Richelle Mead","type":"Fantasy","source":"allnovel","link":"https://allnovel.net/shadow-kiss-vampire-academy-3.html","creation":"Oct 5, 2019 8:58:18 AM","modification":"Oct 6, 2019 12:03:18 AM"}}
