{"id":109465,"no":8,"title":"Page 8","content":"\"ARE YOU GOING TO EAT THAT?\" asked Eddie.\n Eddie might not have known about all the shenanigans that went down with Jill on the first day of school, but not seeing her all day had unnerved him. So, when she and I came downstairs for the second day, we found him waiting in our dorm lobby, ready to go with us to breakfast.\n I pushed my plate and its half a bagel across the table. He\u0027d already polished off a bagel of his own, as well as pancakes and bacon, but was quick to accept my offering. Maybe he was an unnatural hybrid creature, but from what I could tell, his appetite was the same as any human teenage guy. \"How are you feeling?\" he asked Jill, once he\u0027d swallowed a mouthful of bagel. Since he\u0027d eventually hear she hadn\u0027t been in class, we\u0027d simply told Eddie that Jill had been sick from nerves yesterday. The hangover allegations still infuriated me, but Jill insisted on letting them go.\n \"Fine,\" she said. \"A lot better.\"\n I didn\u0027t comment on that but secretly had my doubts. Jill did look better this morning, but she\u0027d hardly had a solid night\u0027s sleep.\n In fact, she\u0027d woken in the middle of the night, screaming.\n I\u0027d leapt out of my bed, expecting no less than a hundred Strigoi or Moroi assassins to come bursting through our window. But when I\u0027d looked over, there\u0027d only been Jill, thrashing and screaming in her sleep. I\u0027d hurried over and finally woken her up with some difficulty. She\u0027d sat up gasping, drenched in sweat, and clutching her chest. Once she\u0027d calmed down, she\u0027d told me it was only a nightmare, but there\u0027d been something in her eyes... the echo of something real. I knew because it reminded me of the many times I\u0027d woken up thinking the Alchemists were coming to take me to the re-education centers.\n She\u0027d insisted she was fine, and when morning came, the only acknowledgment she gave of her nightmare was to insist that we not mention it to Eddie. \"It\u0027s only going to worry him,\" she said. \"And besides, it\u0027s not a big deal.\"\n I conceded that point, but when I tried to ask what had happened, she brushed me off and wouldn\u0027t talk about it.\n Now, at breakfast, there was a definite edge to her, but for all I knew, it had more to do with finally facing her first day in a human school. \"I still can\u0027t get over how different I am from everyone,\" she said in a low voice. \"I mean, for one thing, I\u0027m taller than almost every girl here!\" It was true. It wasn\u0027t uncommon for Moroi women to push six feet in height. Jill wasn\u0027t quite there, but her long, slim build gave the illusion of being taller than she was. \"And I\u0027m really bony.\"\n \"You are not,\" I said.\n \"I\u0027m too skinny - compared to them,\" Jill argued.\n \"Everyone\u0027s got something,\" countered Eddie. \"That girl over there has a ton of freckles. That guy shaved his head. There\u0027s no such thing as \u0027normal.\u0027\" Jill still looked dubious but doggedly went off to class when the first warning bell rang, promising to meet Eddie for lunch and me in PE. I made it to my history class a few minutes early. Ms. Terwilliger stood at her desk, shuffling some papers around, and I hesitantly approached.\n \"Ma\u0027am?\"\n She glanced up at me, pushing her glasses up her nose as she did. \"Hmm? Oh, I remember you. Miss Melbourne.\"\n \"Melrose,\" I corrected.\n \"Are you sure? I could\u0027ve sworn you were named after someplace in Australia.\"\n \"Well, my first name is Sydney,\" I said, not sure if I should be encouraging her.\n \"Ah. Then I\u0027m not crazy. Not yet, at least. What can I do for you, Miss Melrose?\"\n \"I wanted to ask you... well, you see, I have a gap in my schedule because I passed out of the language requirement. I wondered if maybe you needed another teacher aide... like Trey.\" The aforementioned Trey was already there, sitting at a desk allotted to him and collating papers. He glanced up at the mention of his name and eyed me warily. \"It\u0027s last period, ma\u0027am. So, if there was any extra work you needed...\"\n Her eyes studied me for several moments before she answered. I\u0027d made sure to cover up my tattoo today, but it felt like she was staring right through to it. \"I don\u0027t need another teacher aide,\" she said bluntly. Trey smirked. \"Mr. Juarez, despite his many limitations, is more than capable of sorting all my stacks of paper.\" His smirk disappeared at the backhanded compliment.\n I nodded and started to turn away, disappointed. \"Okay. I understand.\"\n \"No, no. I don\u0027t think you do. You see, I\u0027m writing a book.\" She paused, and I realized she was waiting for me to look impressed. \"On heretical religion and magic in the Greco-Roman world. I\u0027ve lectured on it at Carlton College before. Fascinating subject.\"\n Trey stifled a cough.\n \"Now, I could really use a research assistant to help me track down certain information, run errands for me, that sort of thing. Would you be interested in that?\"\n I gaped. \"Yes, ma\u0027am. I would be.\"\n \"For you to get credit for an independent study, you\u0027d have to do some project alongside it... research and a paper of your own. Not nearly the length of my book, of course. Is there anything from that era that interests you?\"\n \"Er, yes.\" I could hardly believe it. \"Classical art and architecture. I\u0027d love to study it more.\"\n Now she looked impressed. \"Really? Then it seems we\u0027re a perfect match. Or, well, nearly. Pity you don\u0027t know Latin.\"\n \"Well...\" I averted my eyes. \"I, um, actually... I can read Latin.\" I dared a glance back at her. Rather than impressed, she mostly looked stunned. \"Well, then. How about that.\" She gave a rueful head shake. \"I\u0027m afraid to ask about Greek.\" The bell rang. \"Go ahead and take your seat, then come find me at the end of the day. Last period is also my planning period, so we\u0027ll have plenty of time to talk and fill out the appropriate paperwork.\"\n I returned to my desk and received an approving fist bump from Eddie. \"Nice work. You don\u0027t have to take a real class. Of course, if she\u0027s got you reading Latin, maybe it\u0027ll be worse than a real class.\"\n \"I like Latin,\" I said with absolute seriousness. \"It\u0027s fun.\"\n Eddie shook his head and said in a very, very low voice: \"I can\u0027t believe you think we\u0027re the strange ones.\"\n Trey\u0027s comments for me in my next class were less complimentary. \"Wow, you sure have Terwilliger wrapped around your finger.\" He nodded toward our chemistry instructor. \"Are you going to go tell her that you split atoms in your free time? Do you have a reactor back in your room?\"\n \"There\u0027s nothing wrong with - \" I cut myself off, unsure what to say. I\u0027d nearly said \"being smart,\" but that sounded egotistical. \"There\u0027s nothing wrong with knowing things,\" I said at last.\n \"Sure,\" he agreed. \"When it\u0027s legitimate knowledge.\"\n I remembered the crazy conversation with Kristin and Julia yesterday. Because I\u0027d had to take Jill to Adrian, I\u0027d missed the study session and couldn\u0027t follow up on my tattoo questions. Still, I at least now knew where Trey\u0027s disdain was coming from - even though it seemed absurd. No one else at school had specifically mentioned my tattoo being special, but a number of people had approached me already, asking where I\u0027d gotten it. They\u0027d been disappointed when I said South Dakota.\n \"Look, I don\u0027t know where this idea\u0027s coming from about my tattoo making me smart, but if that\u0027s what you think, well... don\u0027t. It\u0027s just a tattoo.\"\n \"It\u0027s gold,\" he argued.\n \"So?\" I asked. \"It\u0027s just special ink. I don\u0027t get why people would believe it has some mystical properties. Who believes in that stuff?\" He snorted. \"Half this school does. How are you so smart, then?\"\n Was I really that much of a freak when it came to academics that people had to turn to supernatural explanations? I went with my stock answer. \"I was homeschooled.\"\n \"Oh,\" said Trey thoughtfully. \"That would explain it.\"\n I sighed.\n \"I bet your homeschooling didn\u0027t do much in the way of PE, though,\" he added. \"What are you going to do about your sport requirement?\"\n \"I don\u0027t know; I hadn\u0027t thought about it,\" I said, feeling a little uneasy. I could handle Amberwood\u0027s academics in my sleep. But its athletics? Unclear. \"Well, you better decide soon; the deadline\u0027s coming up. Don\u0027t look so worried,\" he added. \"Maybe they\u0027ll let you start a Latin club instead.\"\n \"What\u0027s that supposed to mean?\" I asked, not liking the tone. \"I\u0027ve played sports.\"\n He shrugged. \"If you say so. You don\u0027t seem like the athletic type. You seem too... neat.\"\n I wasn\u0027t entirely sure if that was a compliment or not. \"What\u0027s your sport?\"\n Trey held his chin up, looking very pleased with himself. \"Football. A real man\u0027s sport.\"\n A guy sitting nearby overheard him and glanced back. \"Too bad you won\u0027t make quarterback, Juarez. You came so close last year. Looks like you\u0027re going to graduate without fulfilling yet another dream.\"\n I\u0027d thought Trey didn\u0027t like me - but as he turned his attention to the other guy, it was like the temperature dropped ten degrees. I realized in that moment that Trey just liked giving me a hard time. But this other guy? Trey completely despised him.\n \"I don\u0027t remember you even being in the running, Slade,\" returned Trey, eyes hard. \"What makes you think you\u0027re going to take it this year?\" Slade - it wasn\u0027t clear to me if that was his first or last name - exchanged knowing glances with a couple friends. \"Just a feeling.\" They turned away, and Trey scowled.\n \"Great,\" he muttered. \"Slade finally got the money for one. You want to know about tattoos? Go talk to him.\"\n My thirty-second impression told me Slade was no one I wanted to talk to, but Trey provided no additional explanation. Class soon started, but as I tried to focus on the lesson, all I could think about was Amberwood\u0027s apparent obsession with tattoos. What did it mean?\n When PE came, I was relieved to see Jill in the locker room. The Moroi girl gave me a weary smile as we walked outside. \"How\u0027s your day been?\" I asked.\n \"Fine,\" Jill said. \"Not great. Not terrible. I haven\u0027t really gotten to know many people.\" She didn\u0027t say it, but Jill\u0027s tone implied, \"See? I told you I would stand out.\"\n Yet as the class started, I realized that the problem was that Jill didn\u0027t stand out. She avoided eye contact, letting her nerves get the best of her, and made no effort to talk to people. No one openly shunned her, but with the vibes she gave off, no one went out of their way to talk to her either. I certainly wasn\u0027t the most social person in the world, but I still smiled and tried to chat with my classmates as we did more volleyball drills. It was enough to foster the sparks of friendship.\n I also soon noticed another problem. The class had been divided into four teams, playing two concurrent matches. Jill was in the other game, but I still occasionally caught sight of her. She looked miserable and tired within ten minutes, without even having done much in the game. Her reaction time was bad too. A number of balls went past her, and those she did notice were met with clumsy maneuvers. Some of her teammates exchanged frustrated looks behind her back.\n I returned to my own game, worried for her, just as the opposing team spiked the ball into a zone that wasn\u0027t well guarded by my team. I didn\u0027t have the reaction time that, say, a dhampir had, but in that split second, my brain knew I could block the ball if I made a hard and fast move. Doing so went against my natural instincts, the ones that said, Don\u0027t do anything that will hurt or get you dirty. I\u0027d always carefully reasoned through my actions, never acting on impulse. Not this time. I was going to stop that ball. I dove for it, hitting it into range of another teammate who was able to then spike it back over the net and out of danger. The volley pushed me to a hard landing on my knees. It was ungraceful and jarred my teeth, but I\u0027d stopped the opposition from scoring. My teammates cheered, and I was surprised to find myself laughing. I\u0027d always been trained that everything I did had to have a greater, practical purpose. Sports were sort of antithetical to the Alchemist way of life, because they were just for fun. But maybe fun wasn\u0027t so bad once in a while. \"Nice, Melrose,\" said Miss Carson, strolling by. \"If you want to defer your sport until winter and be on the volleyball team, come talk to me later.\"\n \"Well done,\" said Micah, and offered me his hand. I shook my head and stood up on my own. I was dismayed to see a scrape on one of my legs but was still grinning from ear to ear. If anyone had told me two weeks ago that I\u0027d be so happy about rolling around in the dirt, I wouldn\u0027t have believed it. \"She doesn\u0027t give out compliments very often.\"\n It was true. Miss Carson had already been on Jill a number of times and was now halting our game to correct a teammate\u0027s sloppy form. I took advantage of the break to watch Jill, whose game was still in action. Micah followed my gaze.\n \"Doesn\u0027t run in the family, huh?\" he asked sympathetically.\n \"No,\" I murmured. My smile faded. I felt a pang of guilt in my chest over exalting so much in my own triumph when Jill was obviously struggling. It didn\u0027t seem fair.\n Jill still looked exhausted, and her curly hair was drenched in sweat. Pink spots had appeared on her cheeks, giving her a feverish look, and it seemed to take all her effort to remain upright. It was strange that Jill would have so much difficulty. I\u0027d overheard a brief conversation in which she and Eddie had discussed combat and defensive moves, giving me the impression that Jill was fairly athletic. She and Eddie had even talked about practicing later that night and -\n \"The sun,\" I groaned.\n \"Huh?\" asked Micah.\n I\u0027d mentioned my concerns about the sun to Stanton, but she\u0027d dismissed them. She\u0027d just advised that Jill be careful to stay inside - which Jill did. Except, of course, when school requirements made her take a class that kept her outside. Forcing her to play sports out in the full blaze of the Palm Springs sun was cruel. It was a wonder she was still standing.\n I sighed, making a mental note to call the Alchemists later. \"We\u0027re going to have to get her a doctor\u0027s note.\"\n \"What are you talking about?\" asked Micah. The game was back on, and he shifted into position beside me.\n \"Oh. Jill. She\u0027s... she\u0027s sensitive to the sun. Kind of like an allergic thing.\"\n As though on cue, we heard Miss Carson exclaim from the other court: \"Melrose Junior! Are you blind? Did you not see that coming right toward you?\" Jill swayed on her feet but took the criticism meekly.\n Micah watched them with a frown, and as soon as Miss Carson was off picking on someone else, he darted out of formation and ran over to Jill\u0027s game. I hastily tried to cover both his and my own positions. Micah ran up to a guy beside Jill, whispered something, and pointed back at me. A moment later, the guy ran over to my team and Micah took the spot beside Jill.\n As class continued, I realized what was happening. Micah was good at volleyball - very good. So much so that he was able to defend his spot and Jill\u0027s. Without seeing any blatant blunders, Miss Carson kept her attention elsewhere, and Jill\u0027s team grew a little less hostile toward her. When the game ended, Micah caught hold of Jill\u0027s arm and quickly walked her over to a shaded spot. From the way she staggered, he seemed to be all that was holding her upright.\n I was about to join them when I heard loud voices beside me.\n \"I\u0027m getting it tonight. The guy I talked to swears it\u0027s gonna be badass.\" It was Slade, the guy who\u0027d sparred with Trey earlier. I hadn\u0027t realized it out in the sun in the middle of the game, but he was the player Micah had swapped places with. \"It better be,\" continued Slade, \"for how much he\u0027s charging me.\"\n Two of Slade\u0027s friends joined him as they began heading toward the locker room. \"When are tryouts, Slade?\" one of his friends asked. In chemistry, I\u0027d learned Slade\u0027s first name was Greg, but everyone seemed to refer to him by his last name, even teachers.\n \"Friday,\" Slade said. \"I\u0027m going to kill. Like totally destroy them. I\u0027m gonna rip Juarez\u0027s spine out and make him eat it.\"\n Charming, I thought, watching them go. My initial assessment of Slade had been correct. I turned toward Jill and Micah and saw that he\u0027d gotten ahold of a water bottle for her. They seemed okay for the moment, so I caught Miss Carson\u0027s attention as she walked by.\n \"My sister gets sick in the sun,\" I said. \"This is really hard on her.\"\n \"Lots of kids have trouble in the heat at first,\" said Miss Carson knowingly. \"They just need to toughen up. You handled yourself okay.\"\n \"Yeah, well, she and I are pretty different,\" I said dryly. If only she knew. \"I don\u0027t think she\u0027s going to \u0027toughen up.\u0027\"\n \"Nothing I can do,\" said Miss Carson. \"If I let her sit out, do you have any idea how many other kids would suddenly \u0027feel tired in the sun\u0027? Unless she\u0027s got a doctor\u0027s note, she\u0027s got to stick it out.\"\n I thanked her and went to join Jill and Micah. As I approached, I heard Micah saying, \"Get cleaned up, and I\u0027ll walk you to your next class. We can\u0027t have you fainting in the halls.\" He paused and considered. \"Of course, I\u0027m totally happy to catch you if you do faint.\"\n Jill was understandably dazed but was with it enough to thank him. She told him she\u0027d meet him soon and walked to the girls\u0027 locker room with me. I eyed the grin on Micah\u0027s face, and a troubling thought occurred to me. Jill seemed stressed enough so I decided not to say anything, but my concern grew when we left for last period. Micah walked with Jill, as promised, and told her that later, when evening came, he\u0027d tutor her in volleyball if she wanted. As we stood outside the classroom, a girl with long red hair and a haughty attitude walked by, trailed by an entourage of other girls. She paused when she saw Micah and tossed her hair over one shoulder, flashing him a big smile. \"Hey, Micah.\"\n Micah was engrossed with Jill and barely glanced in the other girl\u0027s direction. \"Oh, hey, Laurel.\" He walked away, and Laurel watched him go, her expression turning dark. She shot a dangerous look at Jill, whipped her long hair over her shoulder, and stormed off.\n Uh-oh, I thought as I watched her stalk down the hall. Is that going to come back and haunt us? It was one of those moments when I could have used a lesson in social cues.\n I went to Ms. Terwilliger\u0027s classroom afterward and spent most of that initial meeting setting up the semester\u0027s goals and outlining what I\u0027d be doing for her. I was in store for a lot of reading and translation, which suited me just fine. It also appeared as though half of my job would be keeping her organized - something else I excelled at. The time flew by, and as soon as I was free, I hurried off to find Eddie. He was waiting with a group of other boys at the shuttle stop to go back to their dorm.\n When he saw me, his response was the usual: \"Is Jill okay?\"\n \"Fine... well, kind of. Can we talk somewhere?\"\n Eddie\u0027s face darkened, no doubt thinking there was a legion of Strigoi on their way to hunt Jill. We stepped back inside one of the academic buildings, finding chairs in a private corner that enjoyed the full force of air conditioning. I gave him a quick update on Jill and her sunny PE misadventures. \"I didn\u0027t think it would be this bad,\" said Eddie grimly, echoing my thoughts. \"Thank God Micah was there. Is there anything you can do?\"\n \"Yeah, we should be able to get something from our \u0027parents\u0027 or a doctor.\" As much as I hated to, I added, \"Keith might be able to expedite it.\"\n \"Good,\" said Eddie fiercely. \"We can\u0027t have her getting beat up out there. I\u0027ll go talk to that teacher myself, if that\u0027s what it takes.\"\n I hid a smile. \"Well, hopefully it won\u0027t come to that. But there is something else... nothing dangerous,\" I amended quickly, seeing that warrior look cross his face again. \"Just something...\" I tried not to say the words that were popping into my mind. Horrifying. Wrong. \"Concerning. I think... I think Micah likes Jill.\"\n Eddie\u0027s face went very still. \"Of course he likes her. She\u0027s nice. He\u0027s nice. He likes everyone.\"\n \"That\u0027s not what I mean, and you know it. He likes her. In the more-than-friends way. What are we going to do about that?\"\n Eddie stared off across the hall for a few moments before turning back to me. \"Why do we have to do anything?\"\n \"How can you ask that?\" I exclaimed, shocked by the response. \"You know why. Humans and vampires can\u0027t be together! It\u0027s disgusting and wrong.\" The words flew out of my mouth before I could stop them. \"Even a dhampir like you should know that.\"\n He smiled ruefully. \u0027\"Even a dhampir like me?\u0027\"\n I supposed I\u0027d been a little insulting, but it couldn\u0027t be helped. Alchemists - myself included - never believed dhampirs and Moroi worried enough about the same problems we did. They might acknowledge a taboo like this, but years of training said that only we humans really took it seriously. That was why the Alchemist job was so important. If we didn\u0027t look after these matters, who would?\n \"I mean it,\" I told him. \"This is something all of us agree on.\"\n His smile faded. \"Yeah, it is.\"\n Even Rose and Dimitri, who had a high tolerance for craziness, had been shocked at meeting the Keepers, rogue Moroi who intermingled freely with dhampirs and humans. It was a taboo the three of us shared, and we\u0027d worked hard to tolerate the custom while with the Keepers. They lived hidden in the Appalachian Mountains and had provided excellent refuge when Rose was on the run. Ignoring their savage ways had been an acceptable price for the security they\u0027d offered us.\n \"Can you talk to him?\" I asked. \"I don\u0027t think Jill has any strong feelings. She\u0027s got too many other things going on. She probably knows better anyway... but it\u0027d still be best if you could discourage him. We can stop this before she gets involved.\"\n \"What do you expect me to say?\" Eddie asked. He sounded at a loss, which struck me as funny, considering he\u0027d been ready to go make all sorts of demands to Miss Carson on Jill\u0027s behalf.\n \"I don\u0027t know. Play the big brother card. Act protective. Say she\u0027s too young.\"\n I expected Eddie to agree, but he once more averted his eyes. \"I don\u0027t know if we should say anything.\"\n \"What? Are you insane? Do you think it\u0027s okay to - \"\n \"No, no.\" He sighed. \"I\u0027m not advocating it. But look at it this way. Jill\u0027s stuck in a school full of humans. It\u0027s not fair that she be banned from hanging out with any guys.\"\n \"I think Micah wants to do more than hang out.\"\n \"Well, why shouldn\u0027t she get to go on a date now and then? Or go to a dance? She should get to do all the normal things a girl her age does. She\u0027s already had her life radically changed. We shouldn\u0027t make it any harder.\"\n I eyed him in disbelief, trying to figure out why he was so laid back about this. Admittedly, he didn\u0027t face the same consequences I did. If my superiors found out I was \"encouraging\" human and vampire dating, it\u0027d be more evidence against me and my alleged bias. After all, my reputation wasn\u0027t yet restored with the Alchemists. Still, I knew Eddie\u0027s people didn\u0027t like the idea of dating, either. So what was the problem? A strange answer suddenly came to me. \"I feel like you just don\u0027t want to confront Micah.\"\n Eddie looked right at me. \"It\u0027s complicated,\" he said. Something in his face told me I\u0027d hit the mark. \"Why don\u0027t you talk to Jill? She knows the rules. She\u0027ll understand that she can be with him without getting serious.\"\n \"I think it\u0027s a bad idea,\" I said, still unable to believe he was taking this stance. \"We\u0027re creating a gray area here that\u0027s eventually going to cause confusion. We should keep it black and white and ban her from dating while she\u0027s here.\"\n That wry smile returned. \"Everything\u0027s black and white with you Alchemists, isn\u0027t it? Do you think you can really stop her from doing anything? You should know better. Even your childhood couldn\u0027t have been that abnormal.\"\n With that slap in the face, Eddie stalked off, leaving me aghast. What had just happened? How could Eddie - who was so adamant about doing the right thing for Jill - be okay with her casually dating Micah? There was something weird going on here, something connected to Micah, though I couldn\u0027t figure out what. Well, I refused to let this matter go. It was too important. I\u0027d talk to Jill and make sure she knew right from wrong. If necessary, I\u0027d also talk to Micah - though I still felt that conversation would be better coming from Eddie.\n And, I realized, thinking of how I had to go hunt down a doctor\u0027s note, there was one more source I could appeal to, one that had a lot of influence over Jill.Adrian.\n Looked like I\u0027d be paying him another visit. \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bloodlines-bloodlines-1/page-8.html","bookId":2041,"book":{"id":2041,"title":"Bloodlines (Bloodlines #1)","description":"Storyline: \n The first book in Richelle Mead\u0027s brand-new teen fiction series - set in the same world as Vampire Academy.
