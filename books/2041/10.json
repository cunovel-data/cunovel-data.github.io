{"id":109467,"no":10,"title":"Page 10","content":"MY PHONE RANG JUST THEN, saving me from the awkwardness of figuring out what to do about Jill. I answered without bothering to check the caller ID. \"Miss Melbourne? Your services are needed immediately.\"\\n\\n \"Ma\u0027am?\" I asked in surprise. Ms. Terwilliger\u0027s frantic voice was not what I\u0027d been expecting. \"What\u0027s wrong?\"\\n\\n \"I need you to get me a caramel sauce cappuccino from Spencer\u0027s. There is absolutely no way I can finish translating this document if you don\u0027t.\" There were a million responses I could make to that, none of which were very polite, so I went with the obvious point of logic.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think I can,\" I said.\\n\\n \"You have off-campus privileges, don\u0027t you?\"\\n\\n \"Well, yes, ma\u0027am, but it\u0027s almost campus curfew. I don\u0027t know where Spencer\u0027s is, but I don\u0027t think I can make it back in time.\"\\n\\n \"Nonsense. Who\u0027s running your dorm? That Weathers woman? I\u0027ll call down and get you an exception. I\u0027m working in one of the library offices. Meet me there.\"\\n\\n Despite my personal devotion to coffee, getting an \"exception\" to the school\u0027s curfew seemed kind of excessive for an errand like this. I didn\u0027t like to bend the rules. On the other hand, I was Ms. Terwilliger\u0027s assistant. Wasn\u0027t this part of my job description? All the old Alchemist instincts to follow orders kicked in.\\n\\n \"Well, yes, ma\u0027am, I suppose I - \"\\n\\n She disconnected, and I stared at the phone in astonishment. \"I have to go,\" I told Jill. \"Hopefully I\u0027ll be back soon. Maybe very soon since I\u0027ll be surprised if she remembers to call Mrs. Weathers.\" She didn\u0027t look up. With a shrug, I packed my laptop and some homework, just in case Ms. Terwilliger thought of something else for me to do.\\n\\n With coffee on the line, my teacher\u0027s memory was good, and I found I did indeed have clearance to leave when I went downstairs. Mrs. Weathers even gave me directions to Spencer\u0027s, a coffee shop that was a few miles away. I got the cappuccino, wondering if I\u0027d be reimbursed, and picked up something for myself as well. The library staff at Amberwood gave me a hard time about carrying in beverages when I returned, but when I explained my errand, they waved me on through to the back offices. Apparently, Ms. Terwilliger\u0027s addiction was well known.\\n\\n The library was surprisingly busy, and I quickly deduced why. After a certain point each night, guys and girls were banned from each other\u0027s dorms. The library was open later, so this was the place to go to hang out with the opposite sex. Lots of people were just there to study too, including Julia and Kristin. \"Sydney! Over here!\" called Kristin in a stage whisper.\\n\\n \"Break free of Terwilliger,\" added Julia. \"You can do it.\"\\n\\n I held up the coffee as I passed them. \"Are you kidding? If she doesn\u0027t get her caffeine soon, there\u0027ll be no escaping her. I\u0027ll come back if I can.\" As I continued walking through, I saw a small cluster of students gathered around someone - and heard a familiar and annoying voice. Greg Slade\u0027s. Curious in spite of myself, I walked over to the edge of the crowd. Slade was showing off something on his upper arm: a tattoo.\\n\\n The design itself was nothing special. It was an eagle in flight, the kind of generic art all tattoo shops had in stock and copied en masse. What caught my attention was the color. It was all done in a rich, metallic silver. Metallics like that weren\u0027t easy to pull off, not with that sheen and intensity. I knew the chemicals that went into my own gold tattoo, and the formula was complex and composed of several rare ingredients.\\n\\n Slade made a halfhearted effort to keep his voice low - tattoos were forbidden around here, after all - but it was clear he was enjoying the attention. I observed quietly, glad others were asking some of my questions for me. Of course, those questions only left me with more questions.\\n\\n \"That\u0027s brighter than the ones they used to do,\" one of his friends noted.\\n\\n Slade tilted his arm so the light caught it. \"Something new. They say these are better than the ones from last year. Not sure if that\u0027s true, but it wasn\u0027t cheap, I can tell you that.\"\\n\\n The friend who\u0027d spoken grinned. \"You\u0027ll find out at tryouts.\"\\n\\n Laurel - the red-haired girl who\u0027d been interested in Micah - stretched out her leg beside Slade, revealing a slim ankle adorned with a faded butterfly tattoo. No metallics there. \"I might get mine touched up, maybe for homecoming if I can get the money from my parents. Do you know if the celestial ones are better this year too?\" She tossed back her hair as she spoke. From what I\u0027d observed in my brief time at Amberwood, Laurel was very vain about her hair and made sure to throw it around at least every ten minutes.\\n\\n Slade shrugged. \"Didn\u0027t ask.\"\\n\\n Laurel noticed me watching. \"Oh, hey. Aren\u0027t you vampire girl\u0027s sister?\"\\n\\n My heart stopped. \"Vampire?\"\\n\\n \"Vampire?\" echoed Slade.\\n\\n How did she find out? What am I going to do? I had just begun making a list of the Alchemists I had to call when one of Laurel\u0027s friends snickered. Laurel looked at them and laughed haughtily, then turned back to me. \"That\u0027s what we\u0027ve decided to call her. No one human could possibly have skin that pale.\"\\n\\n I nearly sagged in relief. It was a joke - one that hit painfully close to the truth, but a joke nonetheless. Still, Laurel didn\u0027t seem like someone to cross, and it\u0027d be better for all of us if it was a joke soon forgotten. I admittedly blurted out the first distracting comment that came to mind. \"Hey, stranger things have happened. When I first saw you, I didn\u0027t think anyone could have hair that long or that red. But you don\u0027t hear me talking about extensions or dye.\" Slade nearly doubled over with laugher. \"I knew it! I knew it was fake!\"\\n\\n Laurel flushed nearly as red as her hair. \"It is not! It\u0027s real!\"\\n\\n \"Miss Melbourne?\"\\n\\n I jumped at the voice behind me and found Ms. Terwilliger there, watching me with bemusement. \"You aren\u0027t getting credit for chatting, especially when my coffee\u0027s on the line. Come on.\"\\n\\n I skulked away, though hardly anyone noticed. Laurel\u0027s friends were having too much fun teasing her. I hoped I had diffused the vampire jokes.\\n\\n Meanwhile, I couldn\u0027t get the image of Greg\u0027s tattoo out of my mind. I let my thoughts wander to the mystery of what components would be needed for that silver color. I almost had it figured out - at least, I had one possibility figured out - and wished I had access to Alchemist ingredients to do some experiments. Ms. Terwilliger took the coffee gratefully when we reached a small workroom.\\n\\n \"Thank God,\" she said, after taking a long sip. She nodded at mine. \"Is that a backup one? Excellent thinking.\"\\n\\n \"No, ma\u0027am,\" I said. \"It\u0027s mine. Do you want me to start in on those?\" A familiar stack of books sat on the table, ones I\u0027d seen in her classroom. They were core parts of her research, and she\u0027d told me I\u0027d eventually need to outline and document them for her. I reached for the top one, but she stopped me.\\n\\n \"No,\" she said, moving toward a large briefcase. She rifled through papers and assorted office supplies, finally digging out an old leather book. \"Do this one instead.\"\\n\\n I took the book. \"Can I work out there?\" I was hoping if I went back to the main study area, I could talk to Kristin and Julia.\\n\\n Ms. Terwilliger considered. \"The library won\u0027t let you have the coffee. You should probably leave it in here.\"\\n\\n I waffled, debating whether my desire to talk to Kristin and Julia outweighed the likelihood that Ms. Terwilliger would drink my coffee before I got back. I decided to take the risk and bid my coffee a painful farewell as I hauled my books and gear back out to the library.\\n\\n Julia eyed Ms. Terwilliger\u0027s beat-up book with disdain. \"Isn\u0027t that just on the internet somewhere?\"\\n\\n \"Probably not. I\u0027m guessing no one\u0027s even looked at this since before the internet was invented.\" I opened the cover. Dust fluttered out. \"Way before.\" Kristin had math homework open in front of her but didn\u0027t look particularly interested in it. She tapped a pen absentmindedly against the textbook\u0027s cover. \"So you saw Slade\u0027s tattoo?\"\\n\\n \"Hard not to,\" I said, getting out my laptop. I glanced across the screen. \"He\u0027s still showing it off.\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s wanted one for a while but never had the money,\" explained Julia. \"Last year, all the big athletes had them. Well, except for Trey Juarez.\"\\n\\n \"Trey almost doesn\u0027t need one,\" pointed out Kristin. \"He\u0027s that good.\"\\n\\n \"He will now - if he wants to keep up with Slade,\" said Julia.\\n\\n Kristin shook her head. \"He still won\u0027t do it. He\u0027s against them. He tried reporting them to Mr. Green last year, but no one believed him.\"\\n\\n I looked back and forth between them, more lost than ever. \"Are we still talking about tattoos? About Trey \u0027needing\u0027 one or not?\"\\n\\n \"You really haven\u0027t found out yet?\" asked Julia.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s my second day,\" I pointed out with frustration. Remembering I was in a library, I spoke more softly. \"The only people who have really talked about them are Trey and you guys - and you haven\u0027t said much of anything.\"\\n\\n They had the grace to look embarrassed by that, at least. Kristin opened her mouth, paused, and then seemed to change what she was going to say. \"You\u0027re sure yours doesn\u0027t do anything?\"\\n\\n \"Positive,\" I lied. \"How is that even possible?\"\\n\\n Julia cast a glance around the library and twisted in her chair. She rolled her shirt up a little, exposing her lower back - and a faded tattoo of a swallow in flight. Satisfied that I\u0027d seen it, she turned back around. \"I got this last spring break - and it was the best spring break ever.\"\\n\\n \"Because of the tattoo?\" I asked skeptically.\\n\\n \"When I got it, it didn\u0027t look like this. It was metallic... not like yours. Or Slade\u0027s. More like...\"\\n\\n \"Copper,\" provided Kristin.\\n\\n Julia thought about it and nodded. \"Yeah, like reddish-goldish. The color only lasted a week, and while it did, it was amazing. Like, I have never felt that good. It was inhumanly good. The best high ever.\"\\n\\n \"I swear, there\u0027s some kind of drug in those celestials,\" said Kristin. She was trying to sound disapproving, but I thought I detected a note of envy. \"If you had one, you\u0027d understand,\" Julia told her.\\n\\n \"Celestials... I heard that girl over there talk about them,\" I said.\\n\\n \"Laurel?\" asked Julia. \"Yeah, that\u0027s what they call the copper ones. Because they make you feel out of this world.\" She looked almost embarrassed about her enthusiasm. \"Stupid name, huh?\"\\n\\n \"Is that what Slade\u0027s does?\" I asked, stunned at what was unfolding before me.\\n\\n \"No, he\u0027s got a steel one,\" said Kristin. \"Those give you a big athletic boost. Like, you\u0027re stronger, faster. Stuff like that. They last longer than the celestials - more like two weeks. Sometimes three, but the effect fades. They call them steel because they\u0027re tough, I guess. And maybe because there\u0027s steel in them.\"\\n\\n Not steel, I thought. A silver compound. The art of using metal to bind certain properties in skin was one the Alchemists had perfected a long time ago. Gold was the absolute best, which was why we used it. Other metals - when formulated in the proper ways - achieved similar effects, but neither silver nor copper would bind the way gold could. The copper tattoo was easy to understand. Any number of feel-good substances or drugs could be combined with that for a short-term effect. The silver one was more difficult for me to understand - or rather, the effects of the silver one. What they were describing sounded like some kind of athletic steroid. Would silver hold that? I\u0027d have to check.\\n\\n \"How many people have these?\" I asked them, awestruck. I couldn\u0027t believe that such complicated tattoos were so popular here. It was also beginning to sink in just how wealthy the student body here really was. The materials alone would cost a fortune, let alone any of the alleged side effects.\\n\\n \"Everyone,\" said Julia.\\n\\n Kristin scowled. \"Not everyone. I\u0027ve almost got enough saved up, though.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027d say half the school\u0027s at least tried a celestial,\" said Julia, flashing her friend a comforting look. \"You can get them touched up again later - but it still costs money.\"\\n\\n \"Half the school?\" I repeated incredulously. I looked around, wondering how many shirts and pants concealed tattoos. \"This is crazy. I can\u0027t believe a tattoo can do any of that.\" I hoped I was doing an okay job of hiding how much I really knew.\\n\\n \"Get a celestial,\" said Julia with a grin. \"Then you\u0027ll believe.\"\\n\\n \"Where do you get them?\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s a place called Nevermore,\" said Kristin. \"They\u0027re selective, though, and don\u0027t give them out easily.\" Not that selective, I thought, if half the school had them. \"They got a lot more cautious after Trey tried to turn them in.\" There was Trey\u0027s name again. It now made sense that he\u0027d been so disdainful of my tattoo when we met. But I wondered why he cared so much - enough to try to get them shut down. That wasn\u0027t just a casual disagreement.\\n\\n \"I guess he thinks it\u0027s unfair?\" I offered diplomatically.\\n\\n \"I think he\u0027s just jealous that he can\u0027t afford one,\" said Julia. \"He\u0027s got a tattoo, you know. It\u0027s a sun on his back. But it\u0027s just a regular black one - not gold like yours. I\u0027ve never seen anything like yours.\"\\n\\n \"So that\u0027s why you thought mine made me smart,\" I said.\\n\\n \"That could\u0027ve been really useful during finals,\" said Julia wistfully. \"You\u0027re sure that\u0027s not why you know so much?\"\\n\\n I smiled, despite how appalled I was by what I\u0027d just learned. \"I wish. It might make getting through this book easier. Which,\" I added, glancing at the clock. \"I should get to.\" It was on Greco-Roman priests and magicians, a kind of grimoire detailing the kinds of spells and rituals they\u0027d worked with. It wasn\u0027t terrible reading material, but it was long. I\u0027d thought Ms. Terwilliger\u0027s research was more focused on mainstream religions in that era, so the book seemed like a weird choice. Maybe she was hoping to include a section on alternative magical practices. Regardless, who was I to question? If she asked, I\u0027d do it.\\n\\n I outlasted both Kristin and Julia in the library, since I had to stay as long as Ms. Terwilliger stayed, which was until the library closed. She seemed pleased that I\u0027d gotten so far with the notes and told me she\u0027d like the whole book completed in three days.\\n\\n \"Yes, ma\u0027am,\" I said automatically, as if I didn\u0027t have any other classes at this school. Why did I always agree without thinking?\\n\\n I returned to East Campus, bleary-eyed from all the work I\u0027d done and exhausted over the thought of the homework remaining. Jill was fast asleep, which I took as a small blessing. I wouldn\u0027t have to face her accusing stare or figure out how to handle the awkward silence. I got ready for bed quickly and quietly and fell asleep almost as soon as I hit the pillow.\\n\\n I woke at around three to the sound of crying. Shaking off my sleepy haze, I was able to make out Jill sitting up in her bed, her face buried in her hands. Great, shaking sobs racked her body.\\n\\n \"Jill?\" I asked uncertainly. \"What\u0027s wrong?\"\\n\\n In the faint light coming in from outside, I saw Jill raise her head and look at me. Unable to answer, she shook her head and began crying once more, this time more loudly. I got up and came to sit on the edge of her bed. I couldn\u0027t quite bring myself to hug or touch her for comfort. Nonetheless, I felt terrible. I knew this had to be my fault.\\n\\n \"Jill, I\u0027m so sorry. I never should have gone to see Adrian. When Lee mentioned you, I should\u0027ve just stopped it there and told him to talk to you if he was interested. I should\u0027ve just talked to you in the first place...\" The words came out in a jumble. When I looked at her, all I could think of was Zoe and her horrible accusations on the night I\u0027d left.\\n\\n Somehow, my help always backfired.\\n\\n Jill sniffled and managed to get out a few words before breaking down again. \"It\u0027s not... it\u0027s not that...\"\\n\\n I stared helplessly at her tears, frustrated at myself. Kristin and Julia thought I was superhumanly smart. Yet I guaranteed one of them would\u0027ve been able to comfort Jill a hundred times better than I could. I reached out my hand and nearly patted her arm - but pulled back at the last moment. No, I couldn\u0027t do that. That Alchemist voice in me, the voice that always warned me to keep my distance from vampires, wouldn\u0027t let me touch one in a way that was so personal.\\n\\n \"Then what is it?\" I asked at last.\\n\\n She shook her head. \"It\u0027s not... I can\u0027t tell... you wouldn\u0027t understand.\"\\n\\n With Jill, I thought, any number of things could be wrong. The uncertainty of her royal status. The threats against her. Being sent away from all her family and friends, trapped among humans in the perpetual sun. I really didn\u0027t know where to start. Last night, there had been a chilling, desperate terror in her eyes when she woke up. But this was different. This was sorrow. This was from the heart.\\n\\n \"What can I do to help?\" I asked at last.\\n\\n It took her a few moments to pull herself together. \"You\u0027re already doing plenty,\" she managed. \"We all appreciate it - really. Especially after what Keith said to you.\" Was there nothing Adrian hadn\u0027t told her? \"And I\u0027m sorry - I\u0027m sorry I was so bitchy to you earlier. You didn\u0027t deserve that. You were just trying to help.\"\\n\\n \"No... don\u0027t apologize. I messed up.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t have to worry, you know,\" she added. \"About Micah. I understand. I only want to be his friend.\"\\n\\n I was pretty sure that I still wasn\u0027t doing a great job at making her feel better. But I had to admit, apologizing to me at least seemed to be distracting her from whatever had woken her to so much pain.\\n\\n \"I know,\" I said. \"I should never have worried about you.\"\\n\\n She assured me again that she was fine, with no more explanation about why she\u0027d woken up crying. I felt like I should have done more to help, but instead, I made my way back to my own bed. I didn\u0027t hear any more sobs for the rest of the night, but once, when I woke up a couple hours later, I stole a glance at her. Her features were just barely discernible in the early light. She lay there, eyes wide open and staring off into nothingness, a haunted look on her face. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bloodlines-bloodlines-1/page-10.html","bookId":2041,"book":{"id":2041,"title":"Bloodlines (Bloodlines #1)","description":"Storyline: The first book in Richelle Mead\u0027s brand-new teen fiction series - set in the same world as Vampire Academy.
