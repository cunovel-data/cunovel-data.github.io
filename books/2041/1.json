{"id":109458,"no":1,"title":"Page 1","content":"I couldn\u0027t breathe.\\n\\n There was a hand covering my mouth and another shaking my shoulder, startling me out of a heavy sleep. A thousand frantic thoughts dashed through my mind in the space of a single heartbeat. It was happening. My worst nightmare was coming true.\\n\\n They\u0027re here! They\u0027ve come for me!\\n\\n My eyes blinked, staring wildly around the dark room until my father\u0027s face came into focus. I stilled my thrashing, thoroughly confused. He let go and stepped back to regard me coldly. I sat up in the bed, my heart still pounding.\\n\\n \u0027Dad?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Sydney. You wouldn\u0027t wake up.\u0027\\n\\n Naturally, that was his only apology for scaring me to death.\\n\\n \u0027You need to get dressed and make yourself presentable,\u0027 he continued. \u0027Quickly and quietly. Meet me downstairs in the study.\u0027\\n\\n I felt my eyes widen but didn\u0027t hesitate with a response. There was only one acceptable answer. \u0027Yes, sir. Of course.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027I\u0027ll go wake your sister.\u0027 He turned for the door, and I leapt out of bed.\\n\\n \u0027Zoe?\u0027 I exclaimed. \u0027What do you need her for?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Shh,\u0027 he chastised. \u0027Hurry up and get ready. And remember - be quiet. Don\u0027t wake your mother.\u0027\\n\\n He shut the door without another word, leaving me staring. The panic that had only just subsided began to surge within me again. What did he need Zoe for? A late-night wake-up meant Alchemist business, and she had nothing to do with that. Technically, neither did I anymore, not since I\u0027d been put on indefinite suspension for bad behavior this summer. What if that\u0027s what this was about? What if I was finally being taken to a re-education center and Zoe was replacing me?\\n\\n For a moment, the world swam around me, and I caught hold of my bed to steady myself. Re-education centers. They were the stuff of nightmares for young Alchemists like me, mysterious places where those who grew too close to vampires were dragged off to learn the errors of their ways. What exactly went on there was a secret, one I never wanted to find out. I was pretty sure \u0027re-education\u0027 was a nice way of saying \u0027brainwashing.\u0027 I\u0027d only ever seen one person who had come back, and honestly, he\u0027d seemed like half a person after that. There\u0027d been an almost zombielike quality to him, and I didn\u0027t even want to think about what they might have done to make him that way.\\n\\n My father\u0027s urging to hurry up echoed back through my mind, and I tried to shake off my fears. Remembering his other warning, I also made sure I moved silently. My mother was a light sleeper. Normally, it wouldn\u0027t matter if she caught us going off on Alchemist errands, but lately, she hadn\u0027t been feeling so kindly toward her husband\u0027s (and daughter\u0027s) employers. Ever since angry Alchemists had deposited me on my parents\u0027 doorstep last month, this household had held all the warmth of a prison camp. Terrible arguments had gone down between my parents, and my sister Zoe and I often found ourselves tiptoeing around.\\n\\n Zoe.\\n\\n Why does he need Zoe?\\n\\n The question burned through me as I scurried to get ready. I knew what \u0027presentable\u0027 meant. Throwing on jeans and a T-shirt was out of the question. Instead, I tugged on gray slacks and a crisp, white button-down shirt. A darker, charcoal gray cardigan went over it, which I cinched neatly at my waist with a black belt. A small gold cross - the one I always wore around my neck - was the only ornamentation I ever bothered with.\\n\\n My hair was a slightly bigger problem. Even after only two hours of sleep, it was already going in every direction. I smoothed it down as best I could and then coated it with a thick layer of hair spray in the hopes that it would get me through whatever was to come. A light dusting of powder was the only makeup I put on. I had no time for anything more.\\n\\n The entire process took me all of six minutes, which might have been a new record for me. I sprinted down the stairs in perfect silence, careful, again, to avoid waking my mother. The living room was dark, but light spilled out past the not-quite-shut door of my father\u0027s study. Taking that as an invitation, I pushed the door open and slipped inside. A hushed conversation stopped at my entrance. My father eyed me from head to toe and showed his approval at my appearance in the way he knew best: by simply withholding criticism.\\n\\n \u0027Sydney,\u0027 he said brusquely. \u0027I believe you know Donna Stanton.\u0027\\n\\n The formidable Alchemist stood near the window, arms crossed, looking as tough and lean as I remembered. I\u0027d spent a lot of time with Stanton recently, though I would hardly say we were friends - especially since certain actions of mine had ended up putting the two of us under a sort of \u0027vampire house arrest.\u0027 If she harbored any resentment toward me, she didn\u0027t show it, though. She nodded to me in polite greeting, her face all business.\\n\\n Three other Alchemists were there as well, all men. They were introduced to me as Barnes, Michaelson, and Horowitz. Barnes and Michaelson were my father and Stanton\u0027s age. Horowitz was younger, mid-twenties, and was setting up a tattooist\u0027s tools. All of them were dressed like me, wearing business casual clothing in nondescript colors. Our goal was always to look nice but not attract notice. The Alchemists had been playing Men in Black for centuries, long before humans dreamed of life on other worlds. When the light hit their faces the right way, each Alchemist displayed a lily tattoo identical to mine.\\n\\n Again, my unease grew. Was this some kind of interrogation? An assessment to see if my decision to help a renegade half-vampire girl meant my loyalties had changed? I crossed my arms over my chest and schooled my face to neutrality, hoping I looked cool and confident. If I still had a chance to plead my case, I intended to present a solid one.\\n\\n Before anyone could utter another word, Zoe entered. She shut the door behind her and peered around in terror, her eyes wide. Our father\u0027s study was huge - he\u0027d built an addition on to our house for it - and it easily held all the occupants. But as I watched my sister take in the scene, I knew she felt stifled and trapped. I met her eyes and tried to send a silent message of sympathy. It must have worked because she scurried to my side, looking only fractionally less afraid.\\n\\n \u0027Zoe,\u0027 said my father. He let her name hang in the air in this way he had, making it clear to both of us that he was disappointed. I could immediately guess why. She wore jeans and an old sweatshirt and had her brown hair in two cute but sloppy braids. By any other person\u0027s standards, she would have been \u0027presentable\u0027 - but not by his. I felt her cower against me, and I tried to make myself taller and more protective. After making sure his condemnation was felt, our father introduced Zoe to the others. Stanton gave her the same polite nod she\u0027d given me and then turned toward my father.\\n\\n \u0027I don\u0027t understand, Jared,\u0027 said Stanton. \u0027Which one of them are you going to use?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Well, that\u0027s the problem,\u0027 my father said. \u0027Zoe was requested . . . but I\u0027m not sure she\u0027s ready. In fact, I know she isn\u0027t. She\u0027s only had the most basic of training. But in light of Sydney\u0027s recent . . . experiences . . .\u0027\\n\\n My mind immediately began to pull the pieces together. First, and most importantly, it seemed I wasn\u0027t going to be sent to a re-education center. Not yet, at least. This was about something else. My earlier suspicion was correct. There was some mission or task afoot, and someone wanted to sub in Zoe because she, unlike certain other members of her family, had no history of betraying the Alchemists. My father was right that she\u0027d only received basic instruction. Our jobs were hereditary, and I had been chosen years ago as the next Alchemist in the Sage family. My older sister, Carly, had been passed over and was now away at college and too old. He\u0027d taught Zoe as backup instead, in the event something happened to me, like a car accident or vampire mauling.\\n\\n I stepped forward, not knowing what I was going to say until I spoke. The only thing I knew for sure was that I could not let Zoe get sucked into the Alchemists\u0027 schemes. I feared for her safety more than I did going to a re-education center - and I was pretty afraid of that. \u0027I spoke to a committee about my actions after they happened,\u0027 I said. \u0027I was under the impression that they understood why I did the things I did. I\u0027m fully qualified to serve in whatever way you need - much more so than my sister. I have real-world experience. I know this job inside and out.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027A little too much real-world experience, if memory serves,\u0027 said Stanton dryly.\\n\\n \u0027I for one would like to hear these \u0027reasons\u0027 again,\u0027 said Barnes, using his fingers to make air quotes. \u0027I\u0027m not thrilled about tossing a half-trained girl out there, but I also find it hard to believe someone who aided a vampire criminal is \u0027fully qualified to serve.\u0027\u0027 More pretentious air quotes.\\n\\n I smiled back pleasantly, masking my anger. If I showed my true emotions, it wouldn\u0027t help my case. \u0027I understand, sir. But Rose Hathaway was eventually proven innocent of the crime she\u0027d been accused of. So, I wasn\u0027t technically aiding a criminal. My actions eventually helped find the real murderer.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Be that as it may, we - and you - didn\u0027t know she was \u0027innocent\u0027 at the time,\u0027 he said.\\n\\n \u0027I know,\u0027 I said. \u0027But I believed she was.\u0027\\n\\n Barnes snorted. \u0027And there\u0027s the problem. You should\u0027ve believed what the Alchemists told you, not run off with your own far-fetched theories. At the very least, you should\u0027ve taken what evidence you\u0027d gathered to your superiors.\u0027\\n\\n Evidence? How could I explain that it wasn\u0027t evidence that had driven me to help Rose so much as a feeling in my gut that she was telling the truth? But that was something I knew they\u0027d never understand. All of us were trained to believe the worst of her kind. Telling them that I had seen truth and honesty in her wouldn\u0027t help my cause here. Telling them that I\u0027d been blackmailed into helping her by another vampire was an even worse explanation. There was only one argument that the Alchemists might possibly be able to comprehend.\\n\\n \u0027I . . . I didn\u0027t tell anyone because I wanted to get all the credit for it. I was hoping that if I uncovered it, I could get a promotion and a better assignment.\u0027\\n\\n It took every ounce of self-control I had to say that lie straight-faced. I felt humiliated at making such an admission. As though ambition would really drive me to such extreme behaviors! It made me feel slimy and shallow. But, as I\u0027d suspected, this was something the other Alchemists could understand.\\n\\n Michaelson snorted. \u0027Misguided, but not entirely unexpected for her age.\u0027\\n\\n The other men shared equally condescending looks, even my father. Only Stanton looked doubtful, but then, she\u0027d witnessed more of the fiasco than they had.\\n\\n My father glanced among the others, waiting for further comment. When none came, he shrugged. \u0027If no one has any objections, then, I\u0027d rather we use Sydney. Not that I even entirely understand what you need her for.\u0027 There was a slightly accusing tone in his voice over not having been filled in yet. Jared Sage didn\u0027t like to be left out of the loop.\\n\\n \u0027I have no problem with using the older girl,\u0027 said Barnes. \u0027But keep the younger one around until the others get here, in case they have any objections.\u0027 I wondered how many \u0027others\u0027 would be joining us. My father\u0027s study was no stadium. Also, the more people who came, the more important this case probably was. My skin grew cold as I wondered what the assignment could possibly be. I\u0027d seen the Alchemists cover up major disasters with only one or two people. How colossal would something have to be to require this much help?\\n\\n Horowitz spoke up for the first time. \u0027What do you want me to do?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Re-ink Sydney,\u0027 said Stanton decisively. \u0027Even if she doesn\u0027t go, it won\u0027t hurt to have the spells reinforced. No point in inking Zoe until we know what we\u0027re doing with her.\u0027\\n\\n My eyes flicked to my sister\u0027s noticeably bare - and pale - cheeks. Yes. As long as there was no lily there, she was free. Once the tattoo was emblazoned on your skin, there was no going back. You belonged to the Alchemists.\\n\\n The reality of that had only hit me in the last year or so. I\u0027d certainly never realized it while growing up. My father had dazzled me from a very young age about the rightness of our duty. I still believed in that rightness but wished he\u0027d also mentioned just how much of my life it would consume.\\n\\n Horowitz had set up a folding table on the far side of my father\u0027s study. He patted it and gave me a friendly smile.\\n\\n \u0027Step right up,\u0027 he told me. \u0027Get your ticket.\u0027\\n\\n Barnes shot him a disapproving look. \u0027Please. You could show a little respect for this ritual, David.\u0027\\n\\n Horowitz merely shrugged. He helped me lie down, and though I was too afraid of the others to openly smile back, I hoped my gratitude showed in my eyes. Another smile from him told me he understood. Turning my head, I watched as Barnes reverently set a black briefcase on a side table. The other Alchemists gathered around and clasped their hands together in front of them. He must be the hierophant, I realized. Most of what the Alchemists did was rooted in science, but a few tasks required divine assistance. After all, our core mission to protect humanity was rooted in the belief that vampires were unnatural and went against God\u0027s plan. That\u0027s why hierophants - our priests - worked side by side with our scientists.\\n\\n \u0027Oh Lord,\u0027 he intoned, closing his eyes. \u0027Bless these elixirs. Remove the taint of the evil they carry so that their life-giving power shines through purely to us, your servants.\u0027\\n\\n He opened the briefcase and removed four small vials, each filled with dark red liquid. Labels that I couldn\u0027t read marked each one. With a steady hand and practiced eye, Barnes poured precise amounts from each vial into a larger bottle. When he\u0027d used all four, he produced a tiny packet of powder that he emptied into the rest of the mix. I felt a tingle in the air, and the bottle\u0027s contents turned to gold. He handed the bottle to Horowitz, who stood ready with a needle. Everyone relaxed, the ceremonial part complete.\\n\\n I obediently turned away, exposing my cheek. A moment later, Horowitz\u0027s shadow fell over me. \u0027This will sting a little, but nothing like when you originally got it. It\u0027s just a touch-up,\u0027 he explained kindly.\\n\\n \u0027I know,\u0027 I said. I\u0027d been re-inked before. \u0027Thanks.\u0027\\n\\n The needle pricked my skin, and I tried not to wince. It did sting, but like he\u0027d said, Horowitz wasn\u0027t creating a new tattoo. He was simply injecting small amounts of the ink into my existing tattoo, recharging its power. I took this as a good sign. Zoe might not be out of danger yet, but surely they wouldn\u0027t go to the trouble of re-inking me if they were just going to send me to a re-education center.\\n\\n \u0027Can you brief us on what\u0027s happening while we\u0027re waiting?\u0027 asked my father. \u0027All I was told was that you needed a teen girl.\u0027 The way he said \u0027teen girl\u0027 made it sound like a disposable role. I fought back a wave of anger at my father. That\u0027s all we were to him.\\n\\n \u0027We have a situation,\u0027 I heard Stanton say. Finally, I\u0027d get some answers. \u0027With the Moroi.\u0027\\n\\n I breathed a small sigh of relief. Better them than the Strigoi. Any \u0027situation\u0027 the Alchemists faced always involved one of the vampire races, and I\u0027d take the living, non-killing ones any day. They almost seemed human at times (though I\u0027d never tell anyone here that) and lived and died like we did. Strigoi, however, were twisted freaks of nature. They were undead, murderous vampires created either when a Strigoi forcibly made a victim drink its blood or when a Moroi purposely took the life of another through blood drinking. A situation with the Strigoi usually ended with someone dead.\\n\\n All sorts of possible scenarios played through my mind as I considered what issue had prompted action from the Alchemists tonight: a human who had noticed someone with fangs, a feeder who had escaped and gone public, a Moroi treated by human doctors. . . . Those were the kinds of problems we Alchemists faced the most, ones I had been trained to handle and cover up with ease. Why they would need \u0027a teenage girl\u0027 for any of those, however, was a mystery.\\n\\n \u0027You know that they elected their girl queen last month,\u0027 said Barnes. I could practically see him rolling his eyes.\\n\\n Everyone in the room murmured affirmatively. Of course they knew about that. The Alchemists paid careful attention to the political goings-on of the Moroi. Knowing what vampires were doing was crucial to keeping them secret from the rest of humanity - and keeping the rest of humanity safe from them. That was our purpose, to protect our brethren. Know thy enemy was taken very seriously with us. The girl the Moroi had elected queen, Vasilisa Dragomir, was eighteen, just like me.\\n\\n \u0027Don\u0027t tense,\u0027 said Horowitz gently.\\n\\n I hadn\u0027t realized I had been. I tried to relax, but thinking of Vasilisa Dragomir made me think of Rose Hathaway. Uneasily, I wondered if maybe I shouldn\u0027t have been so quick to assume I was out of trouble here. Mercifully, Barnes simply kept going with the story, not mentioning my indirect connection to the girl queen and her associates.\\n\\n \u0027Well, as shocking as that is to us, it\u0027s been just as shocking to some of their own people. There\u0027s been a lot of protests and dissidence. No one\u0027s tried to attack the Dragomir girl, but that\u0027s probably because she\u0027s so well guarded. Her enemies, it seems, have therefore found a work-around: her sister.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Jill,\u0027 I said, speaking before I could stop myself. Horowitz tsked me for moving, and I immediately regretted drawing attention to myself and my knowledge of the Moroi. Nevertheless, an image of Jillian Mastrano flashed into my mind, tall and annoyingly slim like all Moroi, with big, pale green eyes that always seemed nervous. And she had good reason to be. At fifteen, Jill had discovered she was Vasilisa\u0027s illegitimate sister, making her the only other member of their royal family\u0027s line. She too was tied to the mess I\u0027d gotten myself into this summer.\\n\\n \u0027You know their laws,\u0027 continued Stanton, after a moment of awkward silence. Her tone conveyed what we all thought of Moroi laws. An elected monarch? It made no sense, but what else could one expect from unnatural beings like vampires? \u0027And Vasilisa must have one family member in order to hold her throne. Therefore, her enemies have decided if they can\u0027t directly remove her, they\u0027ll remove her family.\u0027\\n\\n A chill ran down my spine at the unspoken meaning, and I again commented without thinking. \u0027Did something happen to Jill?\u0027 This time, I\u0027d at least chosen a moment when Horowitz was refilling his needle, so there was no danger of messing up the tattoo.\\n\\n I bit my lip to prevent myself from saying anything else, imagining the chastisement in my father\u0027s eyes. Showing concern for a Moroi was the last thing I wanted to do, considering my uncertain status. I didn\u0027t have any strong attachment to Jill, but the thought of someone trying to kill a fifteen-year-old girl - the same age as Zoe - was appalling, no matter what race she belonged to.\\n\\n \u0027That\u0027s what\u0027s unclear,\u0027 Stanton mused. \u0027She was attacked, we know that much, but we can\u0027t tell if she received any real injury. Regardless, she\u0027s fine now, but the attempt happened at their own Court, indicating they have traitors at high levels.\u0027\\n\\n Barnes snorted in disgust. \u0027What can you expect? How their ridiculous race has managed to survive as long as they have without turning on each other is beyond me.\u0027\\n\\n There were mutters of agreement.\\n\\n \u0027Ridiculous or not, though, we cannot have them in civil war,\u0027 said Stanton. \u0027Some Moroi have acted out in protest, enough that they\u0027ve caught the attention of human media. We can\u0027t allow that. We need their government stable, and that means ensuring this girl\u0027s safety. Maybe they can\u0027t trust themselves, but they can trust us.\u0027\\n\\n There was no use in my pointing out that the Moroi didn\u0027t really trust the Alchemists. But, since we had no interest in killing off the Moroi monarch or her family, I supposed that made us more trustworthy than some.\\n\\n \u0027We need to make the girl disappear,\u0027 said Michaelson. \u0027At least until the Moroi can undo the law that makes Vasilisa\u0027s throne so precarious. Hiding Mastrano with her own people isn\u0027t safe at the moment, so we need to conceal her among humans.\u0027 Disdain dripped from his words. \u0027But it\u0027s imperative she also remains concealed from humans. Our race cannot know theirs exists.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027After consultation with the guardians, we\u0027ve chosen a location we all believe will be safe for her - both from Moroi and Strigoi,\u0027 said Stanton. \u0027However, to make sure she - and those with her - remain undetected, we\u0027re going to need Alchemists on hand, dedicated solely to her needs in case any complications come up.\u0027\\n\\n My father scoffed. \u0027That\u0027s a waste of our resources. Not to mention unbearable for whoever has to stay with her.\u0027\\n\\n I had a bad feeling about what was coming.\\n\\n \u0027This is where Sydney comes in,\u0027 said Stanton. \u0027We\u0027d like her to be one of the Alchemists that accompanies Jillian into hiding.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What?\u0027 exclaimed my father. \u0027You can\u0027t be serious.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Why not?\u0027 Stanton\u0027s tone was calm and level. \u0027They\u0027re close in age, so being together won\u0027t raise suspicion. And Sydney already knows the girl. Surely spending time with her won\u0027t be as \u0027unbearable\u0027 as it might be for other Alchemists.\u0027\\n\\n The subtext was loud and clear. I wasn\u0027t free of my past, not yet. Horowitz paused and lifted the needle, allowing me the chance to speak. My mind raced. Some response was expected. I didn\u0027t want to sound too upset by the plan. I needed to restore my good name among the Alchemists and show my willingness to follow orders. That being said, I also didn\u0027t want to sound as though I were too comfortable with vampires or their half-human counterparts, the dhampirs.\\n\\n \u0027Spending time with any of them is never fun,\u0027 I said carefully, keeping my voice cool and haughty. \u0027Doesn\u0027t matter how much you do it. But I\u0027ll do whatever\u0027s necessary to keep us - and everyone else - safe.\u0027 I didn\u0027t need to explain that \u0027everyone\u0027 meant humans.\\n\\n \u0027There, you see, Jared?\u0027 Barnes sounded pleased with the answer. \u0027The girl knows her duty. We\u0027ve made a number of arrangements already that should make things run smoothly, and we certainly wouldn\u0027t send her there alone - especially since the Moroi girl won\u0027t be alone either.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027What do you mean?\u0027 My father still didn\u0027t sound happy about any of this, and I wondered what was upsetting him the most. Did he truly think I might be in danger? Or was he simply worried that spending more time with the Moroi would turn my loyalties even more? \u0027How many of them are coming?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027They\u0027re sending a dhampir,\u0027 said Michaelson. \u0027One of their guardians, which I really don\u0027t have a problem with. The location we\u0027ve chosen should be Strigoi free, but if it\u0027s not, better they fight those monsters than us.\u0027 The guardians were specially trained dhampirs who served as bodyguards.\\n\\n \u0027There you are,\u0027 Horowitz told me, stepping back. \u0027You can sit up.\u0027\\n\\n I obeyed and resisted the urge to touch my cheek. The only thing I felt from his work was the needle\u0027s sting, but I knew powerful magic was working its way through me, magic that would give me a superhuman immune system and prevent me from speaking about vampire affairs to ordinary humans. I tried not to think about the other part, about where that magic came from. The tattoos were a necessary evil.\\n\\n The others were still standing, not paying attention to me - well, except for Zoe. She still looked confused and afraid and kept glancing anxiously my way.\\n\\n \u0027There also may be another Moroi coming along,\u0027 continued Stanton. \u0027Honestly, I\u0027m not sure why, but they were very insistent he be with Mastrano. We told them the fewer of them we had to hide, the better, but . . . well, they seemed to think it was necessary and said they\u0027d make arrangements for him there. I think he\u0027s some Ivashkov. Irrelevant.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Where is there?\u0027 asked my father. \u0027Where do you want to send her?\u0027\\n\\n Excellent question. I\u0027d been wondering the same thing. My first full-time job with the Alchemists had sent me halfway around the world, to Russia. If the Alchemists were intent on hiding Jill, there was no telling what remote location they\u0027d send her to. For a moment, I dared to hope we might end up in my dream city: Rome. Legendary works of art and Italian food seemed like a good way to offset paperwork and vampires.\\n\\n \u0027Palm Springs,\u0027 said Barnes.\\n\\n \u0027Palm Springs?\u0027 I echoed. That was not what I\u0027d been expecting. When I thought of Palm Springs, I thought of movie stars and golf courses. Not exactly a Roman holiday, but not the Arctic either.\\n\\n A small, wry smile tugged at Stanton\u0027s lips. \u0027It\u0027s in the desert and receives a lot of sunlight. Completely undesirable for Strigoi.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027Wouldn\u0027t it be undesirable for Moroi too?\u0027 I asked, thinking ahead. Moroi didn\u0027t incinerate in the sun like Strigoi, but excessive exposure to it still made Moroi weak and sick.\\n\\n \u0027Well, yes,\u0027 admitted Stanton. \u0027But a little discomfort is worth the safety it provides. So long as the Moroi spend most of their time inside, it won\u0027t be a problem. Plus, it\u0027ll discourage other Moroi from coming and - \u0027\\n\\n The sound of a car door opening and slamming outside the window caught everyone\u0027s attention. \u0027Ah,\u0027 said Michaelson. \u0027There are the others. I\u0027ll let them in.\u0027\\n\\n He slipped out of the study and presumably headed toward the front door to admit whoever had arrived. Moments later, I heard a new voice speaking as Michaelson returned to us.\\n\\n \u0027Well, Dad couldn\u0027t make it, so he just sent me,\u0027 the new voice was saying.\\n\\n The study door opened, and my heart stopped.\\n\\n No, I thought. Anyone but him.\\n\\n \u0027Jared,\u0027 said the newcomer, catching sight of my father. \u0027Great to see you again.\u0027\\n\\n My father, who had barely spared me a glance all night, actually smiled. \u0027Keith! I\u0027d been wondering how you\u0027ve been.\u0027\\n\\n The two of them shook hands, and a wave of disgust rolled through me.\\n\\n \u0027This is Keith Darnell,\u0027 said Michaelson, introducing him to the others.\\n\\n \u0027Tom Darnell\u0027s son?\u0027 asked Barnes, impressed. Tom Darnell was a legendary leader among the Alchemists.\\n\\n \u0027The same,\u0027 said Keith cheerfully. He was about five years older than me, with blond hair a shade lighter than mine. I knew a lot of girls thought he was attractive. Me? I found him vile. He was pretty much the last person I\u0027d expected to see here.\\n\\n \u0027And I believe you know the Sage sisters,\u0027 added Michaelson.\\n\\n Keith turned his blue eyes first to Zoe, eyes that were just fractionally different from each other in color. One eye, made of glass, stared blankly ahead and didn\u0027t move at all. The other one winked at her as his grin widened.\\n\\n He can still wink, I thought furiously. That annoying, stupid, condescending wink! But then, why wouldn\u0027t he? We\u0027d all heard about the accident he\u0027d had this year, an accident that had cost him an eye. He\u0027d still survived with one good one, but somehow, in my mind, I\u0027d thought the loss of an eye would stop that infuriating winking.\\n\\n \u0027Little Zoe! Look at you, all grown up,\u0027 he said fondly. I\u0027m not a violent person, not by any means, but I suddenly wanted to hit him for looking at my sister that way.\\n\\n She managed a smile for him, clearly relieved to see a familiar face here. When Keith turned toward me, however, all that charm and friendliness vanished. The feeling was mutual.\\n\\n The burning, black hatred building up inside of me was so overwhelming that it took me a moment to formulate any sort of response. \u0027Hello, Keith,\u0027 I said stiffly.\\n\\n Keith didn\u0027t even attempt to match my forced civility. He immediately turned toward the senior Alchemists. \u0027What is she doing here?\u0027\\n\\n \u0027We know you requested Zoe,\u0027 said Stanton levelly, \u0027but after consideration, we decided it would be best if Sydney fulfill this role. Her experience dwarfs any concerns about her past actions.\u0027\\n\\n \u0027No,\u0027 said Keith swiftly, turning that steely blue gaze back on me. \u0027There is no way she can come, no way I\u0027m trusting some twisted vamp lover to screw this up for all of us. We\u0027re taking her sister.\u0027 \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bloodlines-bloodlines-1/page-1.html","bookId":2041,"book":{"id":2041,"title":"Bloodlines (Bloodlines #1)","description":"Storyline: The first book in Richelle Mead\u0027s brand-new teen fiction series - set in the same world as Vampire Academy.
