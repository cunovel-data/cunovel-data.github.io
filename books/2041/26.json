{"id":109482,"no":26,"title":"Page 26","content":"IT TOOK DAYS for me to finally get the whole story, both about Lee and about how Eddie and Jill had come to the rescue that night.\n Once I had Lee as the missing piece, it was easy to connect the murders of Tamara, Kelly, Melody, and Dina, the human girl he\u0027d mentioned. All of them had been killed within the last five years, in either Los Angeles or Palm Springs, and many had documented evidence of knowing him. They weren\u0027t random victims. What little we could find out about Lee\u0027s history came from Clarence, though even that was muddled. By our best guesses, Lee had been turned forcibly into a Strigoi about fifteen years ago. He\u0027d spent ten years that way until a spirit user restored him, much to Lee\u0027s dismay. Clarence hadn\u0027t had all his wits about him even then and hadn\u0027t questioned how his son had returned home after ten years without aging. He evaded answering our questions about Lee being a Strigoi, and we didn\u0027t know if Clarence simply hadn\u0027t known or was in denial. Likewise, it was unclear if Clarence knew his own son was behind Tamara\u0027s death. The far-fetched vampire hunter theory was probably easier for him to stomach than the murderous truth about his son.\n Investigations into Lee\u0027s college in Los Angeles showed he hadn\u0027t actually been enrolled there since before he became Strigoi. When he\u0027d become Moroi again, he\u0027d used college as an excuse to stay in Los Angeles, where he could more easily pursue victims - and we suspected there were more of them than we had records for. From what we\u0027d observed, he\u0027d apparently tried to drink from a few of each race, in the hopes that one of them would be \"the one\" to make him a Strigoi again.\n Further research into Kelly Hayes had uncovered something I should have thought of right away. She was a dhampir. She\u0027d looked human, but that stellar sports record was the tip-off. Lee had stumbled onto her when visiting his father five years ago. Getting the drop on a dhampir wasn\u0027t easy, which was why Lee seemed to have gone to the effort of dating her and luring her in.\n None of us knew anything about the \"bastard spirit user\" who\u0027d converted him, though that was of interest to both the Alchemists and the Moroi. There were very few spirit users on record, and with there still being so much unknown about their powers, everyone wanted to learn more. Clarence was adamant that he knew nothing about this mystery spirit user, and I believed him.\n Alchemists were in and out of Palm Springs all week, cleaning up the mess and interviewing everyone who\u0027d been involved. I met with a number of them, telling my story over and over, and finally had my last debriefing with Stanton over lunch one Saturday. I\u0027d kind of had a perverse interest in knowing what had happened to Keith but decided not to bring it up in light of everything else going on. He wasn\u0027t here, which was all I cared about.\n \"Lee\u0027s autopsy revealed nothing that wasn\u0027t ordinary Moroi, according to their doctors,\" Stanton told me between bites of linguine carbonara. Eating and discussing dead bodies weren\u0027t mutually exclusive, apparently. \"But then, something... magical likely wouldn\u0027t show up anyway.\"\n \"But there must be something special about him,\" I said. I was simply moving my own food around the plate. \"The fact that his aging slowed was proof enough - but the rest? I mean, he drank from so many victims. And then I saw what Jacqueline did to him. That should have worked. All the correct procedures were followed.\"\n It amazed me that I could speak so clinically about this, that I could sound so detached. Really, though, it was just that second-nature Alchemist mode taking over. Inside me, the events of that night had left a permanent mark. When I closed my eyes at bedtime, I kept seeing Lee\u0027s death and Jacqueline feeding him the blood. Lee, who\u0027d brought Jill flowers and taken us all mini-golfing.\n Stanton nodded thoughtfully. \"Which suggests that those who are restored from being Strigoi are immune to ever being turned again.\"\n We sat in silence for a moment, letting the weight of those words settle over us.\n \"That\u0027s huge,\" I said at last. Talk about an understatement. Lee presented a number of mysteries. He had begun aging once he became a Moroi again, but at a much slower rate. Why? We weren\u0027t sure, but that alone was a monumental discovery, as was my suspicion that he could no longer use Moroi magic. I\u0027d been too freaked out to notice anything strange about Lee\u0027s behavior when Jill had asked him to create fog while we were golfing, but looking back, it occurred to me he\u0027d actually looked nervous about her requests. And the rest... the fact that something had changed in him, protected him, however unwillingly, from becoming Strigoi? Yeah. \"Huge\" was an understatement.\n \"Very,\" Stanton agreed. \"Half our mission is to stop humans from choosing to sacrifice their souls for immortality. If there was a way to harness this magic, figure out what protected Lee... well. The effects would be far-reaching.\"\n \"To the Moroi as well,\" I pointed out. I knew that among them and the dhampirs, being forcefully turned Strigoi was often considered a fate worse than death. If there was some magical way to protect themselves, it would mean a lot since they encountered Strigoi far more than we did. We could be talking about some kind of magical vaccine.\n \"Of course,\" said Stanton, though her tone implied she wasn\u0027t nearly as concerned about that race\u0027s benefits. \"It might even be possible to prevent the future creation of all Strigoi. There\u0027s also the mystery of your blood. You said the Strigoi didn\u0027t like it. That could be a type of protection too.\"\n I shivered at the memory. \"Maybe. It all happened so fast... it\u0027s hard to say. And it was certainly no protection from the Strigoi wanting to snap my neck.\"\n Stanton nodded. \"It\u0027s certainly something to look into eventually. But first we have to figure out what exactly happened to Lee.\"\n \"Well,\" I said, \"spirit has to be a key player, right? Lee was restored by a spirit user.\"\n A waiter came by, and Stanton waved her plate away. \"Exactly. Unfortunately, we have a very limited quantity of spirit users to work with. Vasilisa Dragomir hardly has the time to experiment with her powers. Sonya Karp has volunteered to help, which is excellent news, especially since she\u0027s a former Strigoi herself. At the very least, we can observe the slowed aging firsthand. She\u0027s only available for a short while, and the Moroi haven\u0027t answered my request yet for some other useful individuals. But if we had another spirit user on hand, one with no other obligations to distract him from helping us fulltime...\"\n She looked at me meaningfully.\n \"Adrian?\" I asked.\n \"Do you think he\u0027d help research this? Some magical way to protect against Strigoi conversion? Like I said, between Sonya and the others, he\u0027d have help,\" she added quickly. \"I\u0027ve spoken to the Moroi, and they\u0027re putting together a small group with expertise on Strigoi. They plan on sending them out soon. We just need Adrian to help.\"\n \"Wow. You guys move fast,\" I murmured.\n At the words \"Adrian\" and \"research,\" my mind had put together images of him in a lab, wearing a white coat, bent over test tubes and beakers. I knew that the actual research wouldn\u0027t look anything like that, but it was a hard picture to shake. It was also hard to imagine Adrian seriously focused on anything. Except, I kept having that nagging thought that Adrian would focus if he only had something worth caring about. Was this important enough? I really wasn\u0027t sure. It was too hard to guess what purpose might be noble enough to get Adrian\u0027s attention. But I was pretty sure I knew some less-thannoble perks that might get him on board.\n \"If you can get him his own place, I bet he\u0027d do it,\" I said finally. \"He wants out of Clarence Donahue\u0027s pretty badly.\"\n Stanton\u0027s eyebrows rose. She hadn\u0027t expected this. \"Well. That\u0027s not a huge request, I suppose. And actually, we\u0027re already paying the bill for Keith\u0027s old apartment since he took out a year-long lease. Mr. Ivashkov could simply move into there, except...\"\n \"Except what?\"\n Stanton gave a small shrug. \"I was going to offer it to you. After much discussion, we\u0027ve decided to simply make you the Alchemist on point here, in light of Keith\u0027s... unfortunate departure. You could leave Amberwood, move into his apartment, and simply oversee activities from there.\"\n I frowned. \"But I thought you wanted someone with Jill all the time.\"\n \"We do. And we\u0027ve actually found a better choice - no offense. The Moroi were able to locate a dhampir girl Jill\u0027s age, who could not only serve as Jill\u0027s roommate but also as a bodyguard. She\u0027ll be joining the researchers who are coming out. You don\u0027t have to pose as a student anymore.\"\n The world reeled. Alchemist schemes and plans, always in motion. A lot had been decided in this week, it seemed. I considered what this meant. No more homework, no more high school politics. Freedom to come and go when I wanted. But it also meant removing myself from the friends I\u0027d made - Trey, Kristin, Julia. I\u0027d still see Eddie and Jill, but not to the same extent. And if I was on my own, would the Alchemists - or my father - help fund college classes? Unlikely.\n \"Do I have to leave?\" I asked Stanton. \"Can I give the apartment to Adrian and stay on at Amberwood for a while? At least until we figure out if we can get another place for me?\"\n Stanton didn\u0027t bother hiding her surprise. \"I didn\u0027t expect you\u0027d want to stay on. I figured you\u0027d especially be happy to no longer room with a vampire.\"\n And like that, all the fears and pressure I\u0027d faced before coming to Palm Springs descended on me. Vamp lover. I was an idiot. I should\u0027ve been jumping at the chance to get away from Jill. Any other Alchemist would. In offering to stay, I was likely putting myself under suspicion again. How could I explain that there was so much more to my choice than just a change of roommate?\n \"Oh,\" I said, keeping a neutral face. \"When you said you were getting Jill a dhampir her own age, I figured she\u0027d be the roommate and I wouldn\u0027t have to room with Jill anymore. I thought I\u0027d have my own in the dorm.\"\n \"That can probably be arranged...\"\n \"And honestly, after some of the things that have happened, I\u0027d feel better still keeping an eye on Jill. It\u0027ll be easier if I\u0027m at the school. Besides, if it takes an apartment to make Adrian happy and work on this Strigoi mystery, then that\u0027s what we need to do. I can wait.\"\n Stanton studied me for several long seconds, breaking the silence only when the waiter dropped the bill off. \"That\u0027s very professional of you. I\u0027ll look into the arrangements.\"\n \"Thank you,\" I said. A happy feeling welled up in me, and I almost smiled, picturing Adrian\u0027s face when he heard about his new place.\n \"There\u0027s just one more thing I don\u0027t understand,\" remarked Stanton. \"When we investigated the apartment, we saw some fire damage. But none of you who were there reported any.\"\n I put on a contrived frown. \"Honestly... so much of it\u0027s a blur with the blood loss and the biting... I\u0027m not really sure. Keith had some candles. I don\u0027t know if one got lit... or I don\u0027t know. All I keep thinking about is those teeth and how terrible it was when I was bit - \"\n \"Yes, yes,\" said Stanton. My excuse was flimsy, but even she wasn\u0027t entirely impervious to the thought of being fed on by a vampire. It was pretty much an Alchemist\u0027s worse nightmare, and I was entitled to my trauma. \"Well, don\u0027t worry about it. That fire is the least of our worries.\"\n It wasn\u0027t the least of my worries. And when I got back to campus later that day, I finally dealt with it and hunted Ms. Terwilliger down where she was working in one of the library offices.\n \"You knew,\" I said, shutting the door. All thoughts of student-teacher protocol vanished from my head. I\u0027d been sitting on my anger for a week and could now finally let it out. I\u0027d spent my life being taught to respect sources of authority, but now one of those had just betrayed me. \"Everything you made me do... copying those spell books, making that amulet \u0027just to see what it was like\u0027!\" I shook my head. \"It was all a lie. You knew... you knew it was... real.\"\n Ms. Terwilliger took off her glasses and peered at me carefully. \"Ah, so I take it you tried it?\"\n \"How could you do that to me?\" I exclaimed. \"You have no idea how I feel about magic and the supernatural!\"\n \"Oh,\" she said dryly. \"I do actually. I know all about your organization.\" She tapped her cheek, mirroring the one my tattoo was on. \"I know why your \u0027sister\u0027 is excused from outdoor activities and why your \u0027brother\u0027 excels in sports. I\u0027m very informed about the various forces at work in our world, those hidden from most human eyes. Don\u0027t worry, my dear. I\u0027m certainly not going to tell anyone. Vampires aren\u0027t my concern.\"\n \"Why?\" I asked, deciding not to acknowledge her outing everything I strove to keep secret. \"Why me? Why did you make me do that - especially if you claim you know how I feel?\"\n \"Mmm... a couple of reasons. Vampires, as you know, wield a sort of internal magic. They connect with the elements on a very basic, almost effortless level. Humans, however, have no such connection.\"\n \"Humans aren\u0027t supposed to use magic,\" I said coldly. \"You made me do something that violated my beliefs.\"\n \"For humans to do magic,\" she continued, as though I hadn\u0027t spoken, \"we must wrest it from the world. It doesn\u0027t come so easily. Sure, vampires use spells and ingredients occasionally, but nothing like what we must do. Their magic goes from the inside out. Ours comes from the outside in. It takes so much effort, so much concentration and exact calculation... well, most humans don\u0027t have the patience or skill. But someone like you? You\u0027ve been grilled in those painstaking techniques since the time you could talk.\"\n \"So that\u0027s all it takes to use magic? An ability to organize and measure?\" I didn\u0027t bother hiding my scorn.\n \"Of course not.\" She laughed. \"There is a certain natural talent needed as well. An instinct that combines with discipline. I sensed it in you. You see, I have some proficiency myself. It gives me coven status but is still relatively small. You? I can feel a wellspring of power in you, and my little experiment proved as much.\"\n I felt cold all over. \"That\u0027s a lie,\" I said. \"Vampires use magic. Not humans. Not me.\"\n \"That amulet didn\u0027t light itself on fire,\" she said. \"Don\u0027t deny what you are. And now that we\u0027ve determined as much, we can move on. Your innate power might be greater than mine, but I can get you started in basic magical training.\"\n I couldn\u0027t believe I was hearing this. It wasn\u0027t real. It was like something from a movie because no way was this my life. \"No,\" I exclaimed. \"You\u0027re... you\u0027re crazy! Magic\u0027s not real, and I don\u0027t have any! It\u0027s unnatural and wrong. I won\u0027t endanger my soul.\"\n \"So much denial for such a good scientist,\" she mused.\n \"I\u0027m serious,\" I said, barely recognizing my own voice. \"I want nothing to do with your occult studies. I\u0027m happy to go on taking notes and buying you coffee, but if you keep making these kinds of crazy statement and demands... I\u0027ll go to the office and demand to be switched to another teacher. Believe me, when it comes to working bureaucracy and administrative staff, that is something I have innate power in.\"\n She almost smiled, but then it faded. \"You mean that. You\u0027d really reject this amazing potential - this discovery - that you have?\"\n I didn\u0027t answer.\n \"So be it.\" She sighed. \"It\u0027s a loss. And a waste. But you have my word that I won\u0027t bring it up again unless you do.\"\n \"That,\" I said vehemently, \"is not going to happen.\"\n Ms. Terwilliger merely shrugged by way of answer. \"Well, then. Since you\u0027re here, you might as well go get me some coffee.\"\n I moved toward the door and then thought of something. \"Were you the one calling Nevermore and asking about vampires?\"\n \"Why in the world would I do that?\" she asked. \"I already know where to find them.\" Great, I thought. Another mystery.\n I made it to the cafeteria later that day just as Eddie, Jill, and Micah were finishing dinner. Jill was understandably having a difficult time adjusting to Lee\u0027s death and all the revelations we\u0027d uncovered - including his desire to make her his undead queen. Both Eddie and I had talked to her as much as we could, but Micah seemed to have the greatest soothing effect on her. I think it was because he never openly addressed the topic. He knew Lee had died but thought it was an accident and naturally knew none of the vampiric connections. While Eddie and I constantly tried our hand at being amateur psychologists, Micah simply tried to distract her and make her happy.\n \"We have to go,\" he said apologetically when I sat down. \"Rachel Walker is going to give us a lesson on one of the sewing machines.\"\n Eddie shook his head at him. \"I still don\u0027t know why you signed up for sewing club.\" That wasn\u0027t true, of course. We both knew exactly why Micah had joined.\n Jill\u0027s face wore the grave look it had had since Lee\u0027s death - a look she would carry for a while, I suspected - but the ghost of a smile flickered over her lips. \"I think Micah has the makings of a real fashion designer. Maybe I\u0027ll walk in his show one day.\"\n I shook my head, hiding my own smile. \"No modeling of any kind, not for a while.\" After the show, Lia and other designers had gotten in touch, all wanting to work with Jill again. We\u0027d had to refuse in order to protect her identity here, but it had made Jill sad to have to do it.\n Jill nodded. \"I know, I know.\" She stood up with Micah. \"I\u0027ll see you back in our room later, Sydney. I\u0027d like to talk some more.\"\n I nodded. \"Absolutely.\"\n Eddie and I watched them hurry off. I sighed.\n \"That\u0027s going to be a problem,\" I told him.\n \"Maybe,\" he agreed. \"But she knows what she can and can\u0027t do with him. She\u0027s smart. She\u0027ll be responsible.\"\n \"But he doesn\u0027t know,\" I said. \"I feel like Micah\u0027s fallen for her too much already.\" I eyed Eddie carefully. \"Among other people.\"\n Eddie was still watching Micah and Jill, so it took him a moment to pick up on my meaning. He jerked his gaze back to me. \"Huh?\"\n \"Eddie, I\u0027m not going to claim to be any expert in romance, but even I can tell that you\u0027re crazy about Jill.\"\n He promptly looked away, though his flush betrayed him. \"That\u0027s not true.\"\n \"I\u0027ve seen it all along, but it wasn\u0027t until that night at Keith\u0027s that I really understood what I was seeing. I saw how you looked at her. I know how you feel about her. So, what I want to know is: how come we have to keep worrying about Micah at all? Why aren\u0027t you just asking her out and saving us all a lot of trouble?\"\n \"Because she\u0027s my sister,\" he said wryly.\n \"Eddie! I\u0027m serious.\"\n He made a face, took a deep breath, and then turned back toward me. \"Because she can do better than me. You want to talk about social rules? Well, where we come from, Moroi and dhampirs don\u0027t have serious relationships.\"\n \"Yeah, but that\u0027s like a class thing,\" I said. \"It\u0027s not quite the same as humans and vampires.\"\n \"Maybe not, but with her, it might as well be. She\u0027s not just any Moroi. She\u0027s royal. A princess. And you\u0027ve seen how she is! Smart and strong and beautiful. She\u0027s destined for great things, and one of them isn\u0027t being involved with a controversial guardian like me. Her bloodline\u0027s regal. Hell, I don\u0027t even know who my dad is. Dating her is not even possible. My job is to protect her. To keep her safe. That\u0027s where all my attention needs to be.\"\n \"And so you think she deserves being with a human instead?\" I asked incredulously. \"Dancing the line of a taboo upheld by both our races?\"\n \"It\u0027s not ideal,\" he admitted. \"But she can still have a fun social life and - \"\n \"What if it was another guy?\" I interrupted. \"What if some other human asked her out, and they simply went on a casual date? Would you be okay with that?\"\n He didn\u0027t answer, and I knew my hunch was correct.\n \"This is about more than you not feeling worthy of Jill,\" I said. \"This is about Micah too, isn\u0027t it? About how he reminds you of Mason.\"\n Eddie blanched. \"How do you know about that?\"\n \"Adrian told me.\"\n \"Damn him,\" said Eddie. \"Why can\u0027t he be as oblivious as he pretends?\"\n I smiled at that. \"You don\u0027t owe Micah anything. You certainly don\u0027t owe him Jill. He\u0027s not Mason, no matter how much they look alike.\"\n \"It\u0027s more than looks,\" said Eddie, growing pensive. \"It\u0027s the way they act too. Micah\u0027s the same - outgoing, optimistic, excited. That\u0027s how Mason was. There are too few people like that in the world: people who are genuinely good. Mason was taken away from the world too soon. I won\u0027t let that happen to Micah.\"\n \"Micah\u0027s not in danger,\" I said gently.\n \"But he deserves good things. And even if he\u0027s human, he\u0027s still one of the best matches I know of for Jill. They deserve each other. They both deserve good things.\"\n \"And so, you\u0027re going to let yourself suffer as a result? Because you\u0027re so in love with Jill and convinced that she deserves some prince that you aren\u0027t? And because you feel it\u0027s your duty to support all the Masons in the world?\" I shook my head. \"Eddie, that\u0027s crazy. Even you have to see that.\"\n \"Maybe,\" he admitted. \"But I feel like it\u0027s the right thing to do.\"\n \"Right? It\u0027s the masochistic thing to do! You\u0027re encouraging the girl you want to be with one of your best friends.\"\n \"I want her to be happy. It\u0027s worth sacrificing myself.\"\n \"It makes no sense.\"\n Eddie gave me a small smile and a gentle pat on the arm before turning toward an approaching shuttle bus. \"Remember when you said you were no expert in romance? Well, you were right.\"\n \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bloodlines-bloodlines-1/page-26.html","bookId":2041,"book":{"id":2041,"title":"Bloodlines (Bloodlines #1)","description":"Storyline: \n The first book in Richelle Mead\u0027s brand-new teen fiction series - set in the same world as Vampire Academy.
