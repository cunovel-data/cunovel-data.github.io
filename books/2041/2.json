{"id":109459,"no":2,"title":"Page 2","content":"A COUPLE OF PEOPLE GASPED, no doubt over Keith\u0027s use of the term \"vamp lover.\" Neither word was that terrible in and of itself, but together... well, they represented an idea that was pretty much anathema to all that the Alchemists stood for. We fought to protect humans from vampires. Being in league with those creatures was about the vilest thing any of us could be accused of. Even while questioning me earlier, the other Alchemists had been very careful with their choice of language.\n Keith\u0027s usage was almost obscene. Horowitz looked angry on my behalf and opened his mouth as though he might make an equally biting retort. After a quick glance at Zoe and me, he seemed to reconsider, and stayed silent. Michaelson, however, couldn\u0027t help himself from muttering, \"Protect us all.\" He made the sign against evil.\n Yet it wasn\u0027t Keith\u0027s name-calling that really set me off (though that did certainly send a chill through me). It was Stanton\u0027s earlier offhand comment. We know you requested Zoe.\n Keith had requested Zoe for this assignment? My resolve to keep her out of it grew by leaps and bounds. The thought of her going off with him made me clench my fists. Everyone here might think Keith Darnell was some kind of poster child, but I knew better. No girl - let alone my sister - should be left alone with him.\n \"Keith,\" said Stanton, a gentle warning in her voice. \"I can respect your feelings, but you aren\u0027t in a position to make that call.\"\n He flushed. \"Palm Springs is my post! I have every right to dictate what goes on in my territory.\"\n \"I can understand why you\u0027d feel that way,\" said my father. Unbelievable. If Zoe or I had questioned authority like Keith had, our father wouldn\u0027t have hesitated to tell us our \"rights\" - or rather, he\u0027d tell us that we had none. Keith had stayed with my family one summer - young Alchemists sometimes did that while training - and my father had grown to regard him like the son he\u0027d never had. Even then, there\u0027d been a double standard between Keith and us. Time and distance apparently hadn\u0027t diminished that.\n \"Palm Springs may be your post,\" said Stanton, \"but this assignment is coming from places in the organization that are far above your reach. You\u0027re essential for coordination, yes, but you are by no means the ultimate authority here.\" Unlike me, I suspected Stanton had smacked a few people in her day, and I think she wanted to do that to Keith now. It was funny that she would become my defender, since I\u0027d been pretty sure she didn\u0027t buy my story about using Rose to advance my career.\n Keith visibly calmed himself, wisely realizing a childish outburst wasn\u0027t going to get him anywhere. \"I understand. But I\u0027m simply worried about the success of this mission. I know both of the Sage girls. Even before Sydney\u0027s \u0027incident,\u0027 I had serious concerns about her. I figured she\u0027d grow out of them, though, so I didn\u0027t bother saying anything at the time. I see now I was wrong. Back then, I actually thought Zoe would have been a far better choice for the family position. No offense, Jared.\" He gave my father what was probably supposed to be a charming smile.\n Meanwhile, it was getting harder and harder to hide my incredulity. \"Zoe was eleven when you stayed with us,\" I said. \"How in the world could you have drawn those conclusions?\" I didn\u0027t buy for an instant that he\u0027d had \"concerns\" about me back then. No - scratch that. He\u0027d probably had concerns the last day he stayed with us, when I confronted him about a dirty secret he\u0027d been hiding. That, I was almost certain, was what all of this was about. He wanted me silenced. My adventures with Rose were simply an excuse to get me out of the way.\n \"Zoe was always advanced for her age,\" Keith said. \"Sometimes you can just tell.\"\n \"Zoe\u0027s never seen a Strigoi, let alone a Moroi! She\u0027d probably freeze up if she did. That\u0027s true of most Alchemists,\" I pointed out. \"Whoever you send is going to have to be able to stand being around them, and no matter what you think of my reasons, I\u0027m used to them. I don\u0027t like them, but I know how to tolerate them. Zoe hasn\u0027t had anything but the most basic of instruction - and that\u0027s all been in our home. Everyone keeps saying this is a serious assignment. Do you really want to risk its outcome because of inexperience and unsubstantiated fears?\" I finished, proud of myself for staying calm and making such a reasoned argument.\n Barnes shifted uneasily. \"But if Keith had doubts years ago...\"\n \"Zoe\u0027s training is still probably enough to get by,\" said my father.\n Five minutes ago, my father had endorsed me going instead of her! Was anyone here even listening to me? It was like I was invisible now that Keith was here. Horowitz had been busily cleaning and putting away his tattooing tools but looked up to scoff at Barnes\u0027s remark.\n \"You said the magic words: \u0027years ago.\u0027 Keith couldn\u0027t have been much older than these girls are now.\" Horowitz shut his tool case and leaned casually against the wall, arms crossed. \"I don\u0027t doubt you, Keith. Not exactly. But I\u0027m not really sure you can base your opinion of her off memories from when you were all children.\"\n By Horowitz\u0027s logic, he was saying I was still a child, but I didn\u0027t care. He\u0027d delivered his comments in an effortless, easy way that nonetheless left Keith looking like an idiot. Keith knew it, too, and turned bright red.\n \"I concur,\" said Stanton, who was clearly getting impatient. \"Sydney wants this badly, and few would, considering it means she\u0027ll actually have to live with a vampire.\"\n Want it badly? Not exactly. But I did want to protect Zoe at all costs and restore my credibility. If it meant thwarting Keith Darnell along the way, then so much the - \"Wait,\" I said, replaying Stanton\u0027s words. \"Did you say live with a vampire?\"\n \"Yes,\" said Stanton. \"Even if she\u0027s in hiding, the Moroi girl still has to have some semblance of a normal life. We figured we\u0027d kill two birds with one stone and enroll her in a private boarding school. Take care of her education and lodging. We would make arrangements for you to be her roommate.\"\n \"Wouldn\u0027t that mean... wouldn\u0027t that mean I\u0027d have to go to school?\" I asked, feeling a little puzzled now. \"I already graduated.\" High school, at least. I\u0027d made it clear a number of times to my father that I\u0027d love to go to college. He\u0027d made it equally clear that he didn\u0027t feel there was a need.\n \"You see?\" said Keith, jumping on the opportunity. \"She\u0027s too old. Zoe\u0027s a better age match.\"\n \"Sydney can pass for a senior. She\u0027s the right age.\" Stanton gave me a once-over. \"Besides, you were homeschooled, right? This\u0027ll be a new experience for you. You can see what you were missing.\"\n \"It would probably be easy for you,\" said my father grudgingly. \"Your education was superior to anything they can offer.\" Nice backhanded compliment, Dad.\n I was afraid to show how uneasy this deal was making me. My resolve to look out for Zoe and myself hadn\u0027t changed, but the complications just kept growing. Repeat high school. Live with a vampire. Keep her in witness protection. And even though I\u0027d talked up how comfortable I was around vampires, the thought of sharing a room with one - even a seemingly benign one like Jill - was unnerving. Another woe occurred to me.\n \"Would you be an undercover student too?\" I asked Keith. The idea of lending him class notes made me nauseous again.\n \"Of course not,\" he said, sounding insulted. \"I\u0027m too old. I\u0027ll be the Local Area Mission Liaison.\" I was willing to bet he\u0027d just made that title up on the spot. \"My job is to help coordinate the assignment and report back to our superiors. And I\u0027m not going to do it if she\u0027s the one there.\" He looked from face to face as he spoke that last line, but there was no question who she was. Me.\n \"Then don\u0027t,\" said Stanton bluntly. \"Sydney is going. That\u0027s my decision, and I\u0027ll argue it to any higher authority you want to take it to. If you are so against her placement, Mr. Darnell, I will personally see that you are transferred out of Palm Springs and don\u0027t have to deal with her at all.\"\n All eyes swiveled to Keith, and he hesitated. She\u0027d caught him in a trap, I realized. I had to imagine that with its climate, Palm Springs didn\u0027t see a lot of vampire action. Keith\u0027s job there was probably pretty easy, whereas when I\u0027d worked in St. Petersburg, I\u0027d been constantly having to do damage control.\n That place was a vampire haven, as were some of the other places in Europe and Asia my father had taken me to visit. Don\u0027t even get me started about Prague. If Keith were transferred, he took the risk of not only getting a bigger workload but also of being in a much worse location. Because although Palm Springs wasn\u0027t desirable for vampires, it sounded kind of awesome for humans.\n Keith\u0027s face confirmed as much. He didn\u0027t want to leave Palm Springs. \"What if she goes there, and I have reason to suspect her of treason again?\"\n \"Then report her,\" said Horowitz, shifting restlessly. He obviously wasn\u0027t impressed with Keith. \"The same as you would anyone.\"\n \"I can increase some of Zoe\u0027s training in the meantime,\" said my father, almost as an apology to Keith. It was clear whose side my father was on. It wasn\u0027t mine. It wasn\u0027t even Zoe\u0027s, really. \"Then, if you find fault with Sydney, we can replace her.\"\n I bristled at the thought of Keith being the one to decide if I had faults, but that didn\u0027t bother me nearly as much as the thought of Zoe still being tied to this. If my father was keeping her on standby, then she wasn\u0027t out of danger yet. The Alchemists could still have their hooks in her - as could Keith. I vowed then that no matter what it took, even if I had to handfeed him grapes, I would make sure Keith had no reason to doubt my loyalties.\n \"Fine,\" he said, the word seeming to cause him a lot of pain. \"Sydney can go... for now. But I\u0027ll be watching you.\" He fixed his gaze on me. \"And I\u0027m not going to cover for you. You\u0027ll be responsible for keeping that vampire girl in line and getting her to her feedings.\"\n \"Feedings?\" I asked blankly. Of course. Jill would need blood. For a moment, all my confidence wavered. It was easy to talk about hanging out with vampires when none were around. Easier still when you didn\u0027t think about what it was that made vampires who they were. Blood. That terrible, unnatural need that fueled their existence. An awful thought sprang into my mind, vanishing as quickly as it came. Am I supposed to give her my blood? No. That was ridiculous. That was a line the Alchemists would never cross. Swallowing, I tried to conceal my brief moment of panic. \"How do you plan on feeding her?\"\n Stanton nodded to Keith. \"Would you explain?\" I think she was giving him a chance to feel important, as a way of making up for his earlier defeat. He ran with it.\n \"There\u0027s only one Moroi we know of living in Palm Springs,\" said Keith. As he spoke, I noticed that his tousled blond hair was practically coated in gel. It gave his hair a slimy shine that I didn\u0027t think was attractive in the least. Also, I didn\u0027t trust any guy who used more styling products than I did. \"And if you ask me, he\u0027s crazy. But he\u0027s harmless crazy - inasmuch as any of them are harmless. He\u0027s this old recluse who lives outside the city. He\u0027s got this hang-up about the Moroi government and doesn\u0027t associate with any of them, so he isn\u0027t going to tell anyone you guys are there. Most importantly, he\u0027s got a feeder he\u0027s willing to share.\"\n I frowned. \"Do we really want Jill hanging out with some anti-government Moroi? The whole purpose is to keep them stable. If we introduce her to some rebel, how do we know he won\u0027t try to use her?\"\n \"That\u0027s an excellent point,\" said Michaelson, seeming surprised to admit as much.\n I hadn\u0027t meant to undermine Keith. My mind had just jumped ahead in this way it had, spotting a potential problem and pointing it out. From the look he gave me, though, it was like I was purposely trying to discredit his statement and make him look bad.\n \"We won\u0027t tell him who she is, obviously,\" he said, a glint of anger in his good eye. \"That would be stupid. And he\u0027s not part of any faction. He\u0027s not part of anything. He\u0027s convinced the Moroi and their guardians let him down, so he wants nothing to do with any of them. I\u0027ve passed a story to him about how Jill\u0027s family has the same antisocial feelings, so he\u0027s sympathetic.\"\n \"You\u0027re right to be wary, Sydney,\" said Stanton. There was a look of approval in her eyes, like she was pleased at having defended me. That approval meant a lot to me, considering how fierce she often seemed. \"We can\u0027t assume anything about any of them. Although we also checked out this Moroi with Abe Mazur, who concurs he\u0027s harmless enough.\"\n \"Abe Mazur?\" scoffed Michaelson. He scratched at his graying beard. \"Yes. I\u0027m sure he\u0027d be an expert on who\u0027s harmless or not.\"\n My heart lurched at the name, but I tried not to show it. Do not react, do not react, I ordered my face. After a deep breath, I asked very, very carefully, \"Is Abe Mazur the Moroi who\u0027s going with Jill? I\u0027ve met him before... but I thought you said it was an Ivashkov who was going.\" If Abe Mazur was in residence in Palm Springs, that would alter things significantly.\n Michaelson scoffed. \"No, we\u0027d never send you off with Abe Mazur. He\u0027s simply been helping with the organization of this plan.\"\n \"What\u0027s so bad about Abe Mazur?\" asked Keith. \"I don\u0027t know who he is.\"\n I studied Keith very closely as he spoke, looking for some trace of deception. But, no. His face was all innocence, openly curious. His blue eyes - or eye, rather - held a rare look of confusion, contrasting with the usual know-it-all arrogance. Abe\u0027s name meant nothing to him. I exhaled a breath I hadn\u0027t realized I\u0027d been holding.\n \"A scoundrel,\" said Stanton flatly. \"He knows far too much about things he shouldn\u0027t. He\u0027s useful, but I don\u0027t trust him.\"\n A scoundrel? That was an understatement. Abe Mazur was a Moroi whose nickname in Russia - zmey, the serpent - said it all. Abe had done a number of favors for me, ones I\u0027d had to pay back at considerable risk to myself. Part of that payback had been helping Rose escape. Well, he\u0027d called it payback; I called it blackmail. I had no desire to cross paths with him again, mostly because I was afraid of what he\u0027d ask for next. The frustrating part was that there was no one I could go to for help. My superiors wouldn\u0027t react well to learning that, in addition to all my other solo activities with vampires, I was making side deals with them.\n \"None of them are to be trusted,\" my father pointed out. He made the Alchemist sign against evil, drawing a cross on his left shoulder with his right hand.\n \"Yes, well, Mazur\u0027s worse than most,\" said Michaelson. He stifled a yawn, reminding all of us that it was the middle of the night. \"Are we all set, then?\"\n There were murmurs of assent. Keith\u0027s stormy expression displayed how unhappy he was at not getting his way, but he made no more attempts to stop me from going. \"I guess we can leave anytime now,\" he said.\n It took me a second to realize that the \"we\" meant him and me. \"Right now?\" I asked in disbelief.\n He shrugged. \"The vampires are going to be on their way soon. We need to make sure everything\u0027s set up for them. If we switch off driving, we can be there by tomorrow afternoon.\"\n \"Great,\" I said stiffly. A road trip with Keith. Ugh. But what else could I say? I had no choice in this, and even if I did, I was in no position to turn down anything the Alchemists asked of me now. I\u0027d played every card I had tonight, and I had to believe being with Keith was better than a re-education center.\n Besides, I\u0027d just fought a hard battle to prove myself and spare Zoe. I had to continue showing I was up for anything.\n My father sent me off to pack with the same briskness he\u0027d ordered me to make myself presentable earlier. I left the others talking and scurried quietly up to my room, still conscious of my sleeping mother. I was an expert in packing quickly and efficiently, thanks to surprise trips my father had sprung on me throughout my childhood. In fact, I always had a bag of toiletries packed and ready to go. The problem wasn\u0027t so much in speed as it was in wondering how much to pack. The length of time for this assignment hadn\u0027t been specified, and I had the uneasy feeling that no one actually knew. Were we talking about a few weeks? An entire school year? I\u0027d heard someone mention the Moroi wanting to repeal the law that endangered Jill, but that seemed like the kind of legal process that could take a while. To make things worse, I didn\u0027t even know what to wear to high school. The only thing I was certain of was that the weather would be hot. I ended up packing ten of my lightest outfits and hoped I\u0027d be able to do laundry.\n \"Sydney?\"\n I was putting my laptop in a messenger bag when Zoe appeared in my doorway. She\u0027d redone her braids so that they were neater, and I wondered if it had been an attempt to impress our father. \"Hey,\" I said, smiling at her. She slipped into the room and shut the door behind her. I was glad she\u0027d come to say goodbye. I would miss her and wanted her to know that -\n \"Why did you do that to me?\" she demanded before I could get a word out. \"Do you know how humiliated I am?\"\n I was taken aback, speechless for a few moments. \"I... what are you talking about? I was trying to - \"\n \"You made me sound incompetent!\" she said. I was astonished to see the glint of tears in her eyes. \"You went on and on about how I didn\u0027t have any experience and couldn\u0027t handle doing what you and Dad do! I looked like an idiot in front of all those Alchemists. And Keith.\"\n \"Keith Darnell is no one you need to worry about impressing,\" I said quickly, trying to control my temper. Seeing her stormy face, I sighed and replayed the conversation in the study. I hadn\u0027t been trying to make Zoe look bad so much as do whatever I could to make sure I was the one sent away. I\u0027d had no clue she would take it like this. \"Look, I wasn\u0027t trying to embarrass you. I was trying to protect you.\"\n She gave a harsh laugh, and the anger sounded weird coming from someone as gentle as Zoe. \"Is that what you call it? You even said yourself that you were trying to get a promotion!\"\n I grimaced. Yes, I had said that. But I could hardly tell her the truth. No human knew the truth about why I\u0027d helped Rose. Lying to my own kind - especially my sister - pained me, but there was nothing I could do. As usual, I felt trapped in the middle. So, I dodged the comment.\n \"You were never intended to be an Alchemist,\" I said. \"There are better things for you out there.\"\n \"Because I\u0027m not as smart as you?\" she asked. \"Because I don\u0027t speak five languages?\"\n \"That has nothing to do with it,\" I snapped. \"Zoe, you\u0027re wonderful, and you\u0027d probably make a great Alchemist! But believe me, the Alchemist life...\n you don\u0027t want any part of it.\" I wanted to tell her that she\u0027d hate it. I wanted to tell her that she\u0027d never be responsible for her own future or get to make her own decisions again. But my sense of duty prevented me, and I stayed silent.\n \"I\u0027d do it,\" she said. \"I\u0027d help protect us from vampires... if Dad wanted me to.\" Her voice wavered a little, and I suddenly wondered what was really fueling her desire to be an Alchemist.\n \"If you want to get close to Dad, find another way. The Alchemist cause might be a good one, but once you\u0027re in it, they own you.\" I wished I could explain to her how it felt. \"You don\u0027t want this life.\"\n \"Because you want it all for yourself?\" she demanded. She was a few inches shorter than me but filled with so much fury and fierceness right now that she seemed to take up the room.\n \"No! I don\u0027t - you don\u0027t understand,\" I finally said. I wanted to throw my hands up in exasperation but held back, as always.\n The look she gave me nearly turned me to ice. \"Oh, I think I understand perfectly.\" She turned around abruptly and hurried out the door, still managing to move quietly. Her fear of our father overpowered her anger at me.\n I stared at where she\u0027d been standing and felt terrible. How could she have thought I was really trying to steal all the glory and make her look bad? Because that\u0027s exactly what you said, a voice inside me pointed out. I supposed it was true, but I\u0027d never expected her to be offended. I\u0027d never known she had any interest in being one of the Alchemists. Even now, I wondered if her desire was more about being a part of something and proving herself to our father than it was about really wishing she\u0027d been chosen for this task.\n Whatever her reasons, there was nothing to be done for it now. I might not like the heavy-handed way the Alchemists had dealt with me, but I still fiercely believed in what they were doing to protect humans from vampires. And I definitely believed in keeping Jill safe from her own people if it meant avoiding a massive civil war. I could do this job and do it well. And Zoe - she would be free to pursue whatever she wanted in life.\n \"What took you so long?\" my father asked when I returned to the study. My conversation with Zoe had delayed me a couple minutes, which was two minutes too long for him. I didn\u0027t attempt to answer.\n \"I\u0027m ready to go whenever you are,\" Keith told me. His mood had shifted while I was upstairs. Friendliness oozed from him now, so strongly that it was a wonder everyone didn\u0027t recognize it as fake. He\u0027d apparently decided to try a more pleasant attitude around me, either in the hopes of impressing the others or sucking up to me so that I wouldn\u0027t reveal what I knew about him. Yet even as he wore that plastic smile, there was a stiffness in his posture and the way he crossed his arms that told me - if no else - that he was no happier about being thrown together than I was. \"I can even do most of the driving.\"\n \"I don\u0027t mind doing my share,\" I said, trying to avoid glancing at his glass eye. I also wasn\u0027t comfortable being driven by someone with faulty depth perception.\n \"I\u0027d like to speak to Sydney in private before she goes, if that\u0027s all right,\" my father said.\n No one had a problem with that, and he led me into the kitchen, shutting the door behind us. We stood quietly for a few moments, simply facing each other with arms crossed. I suddenly dared to hope that maybe he\u0027d come to tell me he was sorry for how things had been between us this last month, that he forgave me and loved me. Honestly, I would\u0027ve been happy if he\u0027d simply wanted a private, fatherly goodbye.\n He peered down at me intently, his brown eyes so identical to mine. I hoped mine never had such a cold look in them. \"I don\u0027t have to tell you how important this is for you, for all of us.\"\n So much for fatherly affection.\n \"No, sir,\" I said. \"You don\u0027t.\"\n \"I don\u0027t know if you can undo the disgrace you brought down on us by running off with them, but this is a step in the right direction. Do not mess this up. You\u0027re being tested. Follow your orders. Keep the Moroi girl out of trouble.\" He sighed and ran a hand through his dark blond hair, which I\u0027d also inherited. Strange, I thought, that we had so many things in common... yet were so completely different. \"Thank God Keith is with you. Follow his lead. He knows what he\u0027s doing.\"\n I stiffened. There was that note of pride in his voice again, like Keith was the greatest thing walking the earth. My father had seen to it that my training was thorough, but when Keith had stayed with us, my father had taken him on trips and lessons I\u0027d never been part of. My sisters and I had been furious.\n We\u0027d always suspected that our father regretted having only daughters, and that had been proof. But it wasn\u0027t jealousy that made my blood boil and teeth clench now.\n For a moment, I thought, What if I tell him what I know? What will he think of his golden boy then? But staring into my father\u0027s hard eyes, I answered my own question: No one would believe me. That was immediately followed by the memory of another voice and a girl\u0027s frightened, pleading face staring at me with big brown eyes. Don\u0027t tell, Sydney. Whatever you do, don\u0027t tell what Keith did. Don\u0027t tell anyone. I couldn\u0027t betray her like that.\n My father was still waiting for an answer. I swallowed and nodded. \"Yes, sir.\"\n He raised his eyebrows, clearly pleased, and gave me a rough pat on the shoulder. It was the closest he\u0027d come to real affection in a while. I flinched, both from surprise and because of how rigid I was with frustration. \"Good.\" He moved toward the kitchen door and then paused to glance back at me.\n \"Maybe there\u0027s hope for you yet.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bloodlines-bloodlines-1/page-2.html","bookId":2041,"book":{"id":2041,"title":"Bloodlines (Bloodlines #1)","description":"Storyline: \n The first book in Richelle Mead\u0027s brand-new teen fiction series - set in the same world as Vampire Academy.
