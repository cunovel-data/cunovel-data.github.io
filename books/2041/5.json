{"id":109462,"no":5,"title":"Page 5","content":"AND ON THAT NOTE, Rose left me so she could tell the others goodbye. Her words left me chilled. For half a second, I wanted to demand a reassessment of this mission. I wanted to insist that they send no less than a dozen guardians here with Jill, in the event her attackers came back. Soon, I dismissed that thought. One of the key parts of this plan working was simply not attracting attention. So long as her whereabouts were secret, Jill was safer if she blended in. A squadron of guardians would hardly be discreet and could attract notice from the larger Moroi community. We were doing the right thing. So long as no one knew we were here, all would be well. Surely if I told myself that often enough, it would become true. Yet why Rose\u0027s ominous statement? Why Eddie\u0027s presence? Had this mission really been bumped from \"inconvenient\" to \"life-threatening\"? Knowing how close Jill and Rose were, I kind of expected their goodbye to be more tearful. Instead, it was Adrian whom Jill had the most difficulty leaving. She flung herself at him in a giant hug, fingers clinging to his shirt. The young Moroi girl had remained quiet for most of the visit, simply watching the rest of us in that curious, nervous way of hers. The most I\u0027d heard her talk was when Lee had tried to draw her out earlier. Her goodbye display seemed to surprise Adrian too, though the snarky look he\u0027d worn on his face softened into something like affection as he awkwardly patted her shoulder. \"There, there, Jailbait. I\u0027ll see you again soon.\" \"I wish you were coming with us,\" she said in a small voice. He crooked her a grin. \"No, you don\u0027t. Maybe the rest of them can get away with playing back-to-school, but I\u0027d be thrown out on my first day. At least here, I won\u0027t corrupt anyone... unless it\u0027s Clarence and his liquor cabinet.\" \"I\u0027ll be in touch,\" promised Jill. His smile twitched, and he gave her a knowing look that was both amused and rueful. \"So will I.\" This small moment between them was odd. With his flippant, arrogant nature and her sweet shyness, they seemed like an unlikely pair of friends. Yet there was obvious affection between them. It didn\u0027t seem romantic but had a definite intensity I couldn\u0027t quite understand. I remembered the conversation I\u0027d overheard between Abe and Adrian, where Abe had said it was imperative Adrian stay near Jill. Something told me there was a connection between that and what I was witnessing now, but I didn\u0027t have enough information to put it all together. I filed this mystery away for later. I was sad to leave Rose but glad that our departure meant parting ways with Abe and Keith. Abe left with his typically cryptic remarks and a knowing look for me that I didn\u0027t appreciate. I dropped Keith off at his place before going on to Amberwood, and he told me he\u0027d keep me updated. Honestly, I wondered what exactly he had to update me on, since I was doing most of the work around here. As far as I could tell, he really had nothing to do except lounge around in his downtown apartment. Still, it was worth it to be rid of him. I never thought I\u0027d be so happy to drive off with a vampire and a dhampir. Jill still seemed troubled during the car ride to the school. Eddie, sensing this, tried to soothe her. He peered back at her from the passenger seat. \"We\u0027ll see Adrian soon.\" \"I know,\" she said with a sigh. \"And nothing else bad is going to happen. You\u0027re safe. They can\u0027t find you here.\" \"I know that too,\" she said. \"How bad was it?\" I asked. \"The attack, I mean. No one\u0027s getting into details.\" Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Eddie glance back at Jill again. \"Bad enough,\" he said grimly. \"But everyone\u0027s okay now; that\u0027s what matters.\" Neither of them said any more, and I quickly picked up on the hint that no more details would be forthcoming. They acted as though the attack had been no big deal, that it was done and over with, but they were being too evasive. Something had happened that I didn\u0027t know about - that the Alchemists likely didn\u0027t know about - something that they were working to keep secret. My guess was that it had to do with Adrian being here. He had mentioned an \"obvious reason\" for coming to Palm Springs, and then Abe had hinted at some ulterior motive that Adrian himself didn\u0027t know about. It was all kind of annoying, seeing as I was risking my life here. How did they expect me to adequately do my job if they insisted on making this a tangle of secrets? Alchemists dealt in secrets, and despite my rocky past, I was still Alchemist enough to resent being denied answers. Fortunately, I was also Alchemist enough to hunt those answers down myself. Of course, I knew grilling Jill and Eddie right away wasn\u0027t going to get me anywhere. I needed to play it friendly and get them to relax around me. They might not harbor the secret belief that humans were creatures of darkness, but that didn\u0027t mean they trusted me yet. I didn\u0027t blame them. After all, I certainly didn\u0027t trust them either. It was well into evening when we arrived at Amberwood. Keith and I had scoped out the school earlier, but Eddie and Jill took it in with wide eyes. Whereas Clarence\u0027s home had seemed old-fashioned, the school was bright and modern, consisting of stucco buildings that were so typical of California and southwest architecture. Palm trees skirted along lush green lawns. In the fading light, students were still strolling, in pairs and groups, along the many walking paths that wove throughout the grounds. We\u0027d picked up fast food along the way, but the late hour meant Jill and I had to split from Eddie. At eighteen, with a car and \"parental permission,\" I had a lot of freedom to come and go, but I had to answer to curfew just like everyone else when night came. Eddie was uneasy about leaving Jill, particularly when he realized how far away from her he\u0027d be. Amberwood Prep\u0027s sprawling grounds were divided into three campuses: East, West, and Central. East Campus housed the girls\u0027 dorm while West contained the boys\u0027. Central, the largest of the three, was where the administrative, academic, and recreational facilities were. The campuses were about a mile apart from each other and served by a shuttle bus that ran throughout the day, though walking was always an option for those who could stand the heat. Eddie had to have known he couldn\u0027t stay in the girls\u0027 dorm, though I suspected that if he had his way, he would have slept at the foot of Jill\u0027s bed like a loyal dog. Watching the two of them was kind of amazing. I\u0027d never observed a guardian-Moroi pairing before. When I\u0027d been with Rose and Dimitri, they\u0027d been simply trying to keep themselves alive - plus, they were both dhampirs. Now, I was finally able to see the system in action and understood why dhampirs trained so hard. You\u0027d have to, to remain that vigilant. Even in the most mundane moments, Eddie always watched our surroundings. Nothing escaped his notice. \"How good is the security system here?\" he demanded when we stepped inside the girls\u0027 dorm. He\u0027d insisted on seeing it before going to his own. The lobby was quiet at this hour, and only a couple of students wandered through with boxes and suitcases as they finished last-minute move-ins. They gave us curious looks as they passed, and I had to quell the knot of anxiety rising in me. Considering everything else going on for me, high school social life shouldn\u0027t scare me - but it did. The Alchemists didn\u0027t cover that in their lessons. \"Security\u0027s good enough,\" I said, keeping my voice low as I turned back to Eddie. \"They aren\u0027t worried about vampire assassins, but they certainly want their students safe. I know there are security guards that patrol the grounds at night.\" Eddie eyed the dorm matron, a stout, gray-haired woman who supervised the lobby from her desk. \"Do you think she has any kind of combat training? Do you think she could subdue an intruder?\" \"I bet she could wrestle down a guy sneaking into a girl\u0027s room,\" joked Jill. She rested a hand on his arm, making him jump. \"Relax. This place is safe.\" In some ways, Eddie\u0027s concern was comforting and made me feel secure. At the same time, I couldn\u0027t help but think again about why he was so watchful. He\u0027d been there for the attack that no one would tell me about. He knew the threats because he\u0027d seen them firsthand. If he was this on edge, even now, then how much danger were we still in? The Alchemists had led me to believe that once we were hidden here at Amberwood, all would be well and it would just become a waiting game. I\u0027d had that very conversation with Rose and tried to convince her of the same. Eddie\u0027s attitude was concerning. The dorm room I shared with Jill was small by my standards. I\u0027d always had my own room growing up and never had to worry about sharing space or closets. During my time in St. Petersburg, I\u0027d even had my own apartment. Still, our one window had a sweeping view of the dorm\u0027s back courtyard. Everything inside the room was airy and bright, with maple-finished furniture that looked new: beds, desks, and dressers. I had no experience with dorm rooms - but I could only assume by Jill\u0027s reaction that we\u0027d gotten a good one. She swore that the room was larger than the one she\u0027d had at her Moroi school, St. Vladimir\u0027s Academy, and was quite happy. I half-wondered if she thought our room was big simply because we had so little to put in it. Neither of us had been able to do much packing with such swift departures. The furniture gave everything a warm, golden feel, but without personal decorations or other touches, the room could\u0027ve come straight from a catalog. The dorm matron, Mrs. Weathers, had been astonished when she saw us and our minimal luggage. The girls I\u0027d observed moving in earlier had arrived with cars packed to bursting. I hoped we didn\u0027t look suspicious. Jill paused to stare out the window as we got ready for bed. \"It\u0027s so dry here,\" she murmured, more to herself than me. \"They keep the lawn green, but it\u0027s so strange not to feel the moisture in the air.\" She glanced over at me sheepishly. \"I\u0027m a water user.\" \"I know,\" I said, not sure what else to add. She was referring to the magical abilities all Moroi possessed. Each Moroi specialized in one of the elements, either the physical four - earth, air, water, and fire - or the more intangible and psychic element of spirit. Hardly anyone wielded that last one, though I\u0027d heard Adrian was one of the few. If Jill couldn\u0027t access her magic easily, I wasn\u0027t going to be disappointed. Magic was one of those things, like the blood drinking, that served as a slap-in-the-face reminder that these people I was laughing and eating with were not human. If I wasn\u0027t still exhausted from the drive with Keith, I probably would\u0027ve lain awake agonizing over the fact that I was sleeping close to a vampire. When I\u0027d first met Rose, I hadn\u0027t even been able to stay in the same room with her. Our hectic escape together had changed that a little, and by the end, I\u0027d been able to let my guard down. Now, some of that old fear came back in the darkness. Vampire, vampire. Sternly, I told myself it was just Jill. I had nothing to worry about. Eventually, fatigue triumphed fear, and I slept. When morning came, I couldn\u0027t help looking in the mirror to make sure I had no bite marks or other sign of vampire harm. When I\u0027d finished, I immediately felt foolish. With the difficulty Jill was currently having waking up, it made no sense to imagine her sneaking up on me in the night. As it was, I had a hard time getting her out the door in time for orientation. She was groggy, with bloodshot eyes, and kept complaining about a headache. I guessed I didn\u0027t have to worry about nighttime attacks from my roommate. Nonetheless, she managed to get up and around. We left our dorm and found Eddie, gathering with other new students near a fountain on Central Campus. Most of the crowd appeared to be freshmen like Jill. Only a few were the same age as me and Eddie, and I was surprised to see him easily chatting with those around him. With how vigilant he\u0027d been the day before, I would\u0027ve expected him to be more on guard, less capable of normal social interaction - but he fit right in. As we walked up, however, I caught him glance around stealthily at his surroundings. He might be playing a student, like me - but he was still a dhampir. He was just telling us about how he hadn\u0027t met his roommate yet when a smiling guy with bright blue eyes and reddish hair strode up to them. \"Hey there,\" he said. Up close, I could see a smattering of freckles. \"Are you Eddie Melrose?\" \"Yes, I\u0027m - \" Eddie had spun around with that guardian efficiency, ready to take on this potential threat. When he saw the newcomer, Eddie went perfectly still. His eyes widened slightly, and whatever he\u0027d been about to say faded away. \"I\u0027m Micah Vallence. I\u0027m your roommate - also your orientation leader.\" He nodded toward the other mingling students and grinned. \"But I wanted to come say hi first since I just got here this morning. My mom pushed our vacation to the limits.\" Eddie was still staring at Micah as though he\u0027d seen a ghost. I studied Micah too, wondering what I was missing. He seemed normal to me. Whatever was going on, Jill was also out of the loop because she was regarding Micah with a perfectly ordinary expression too, no alarm or surprise. \"Nice to meet you,\" said Eddie at last. \"These are my, uh, sisters - Jill and Sydney.\" Micah smiled at each of us in turn. He had a manner about him that made me feel easy, and I could see why he\u0027d been drafted as an orientation leader. I wondered why Eddie was reacting so strangely. \"What grades are you in?\" he asked us. \"Senior,\" I said. Remembering the cover story, I added, \"Eddie and I are twins.\" \"I\u0027m a freshman,\" said Jill. Looking over our \"family,\" I noticed that Eddie and I could probably pass for siblings pretty easily. Our coloring was similar, and of course, there was the fact that we both looked human. While a human wouldn\u0027t necessarily look at Jill and say \"vampire!\" she still possessed certain features that marked her as unusual. Her build and paleness were definite contrasts to me and Eddie. If Micah noticed the lack of family resemblance, he didn\u0027t let on. \"Nervous about starting high school?\" he asked Jill. She shook her head and smiled back. \"I\u0027m ready for the challenge.\" \"Well, if you need anything, let me know,\" he said. \"For now, I\u0027ve gotta get this party started. Talk to you guys later.\" From the way his attention focused solely on her, it was obvious that the \"if you need anything\" was directed at Jill, and her blush showed that she knew too. She smiled, holding his gaze a moment, and then looked away shyly. I would\u0027ve found it cute, if not for the alarming prospect it presented. Jill was in a school full of humans. It was absolutely out of the question for her to date one, and guys like Micah couldn\u0027t be encouraged. Eddie didn\u0027t appear to care about the comment, but it seemed to be more because he was still troubled about Micah in general. Micah called our group to attention and began the orientation. The first part of it was simply a tour of the grounds. We followed him around, in and out of air conditioning, as he showed us the important buildings. He explained the shuttle system, and we rode it up to West Campus, which was almost a mirror of East. Boys and girls were allowed in each other\u0027s dorms, with limitations, and he explained those rules as well, which caused some grumbling. Recalling the formidable Mrs. Weathers, I felt sorry for any boy that tried to break her dorm rules. Both dorms had their own cafeterias, where any student was welcome to eat, and our orientation group had lunch while we were still on West Campus. Micah joined my \"siblings\" and me, going out of his way to talk to each of us. Eddie responded politely, nodding and asking questions, but his eyes still looked vaguely haunted. Jill was shy at first, but once Micah starting joking around with her, she eventually warmed up to him. How funny, I thought, that it was easier for Eddie and Jill to adapt to this situation than it was for me. They were in a strange environment, with a different race, but were still among familiar things, like cafeterias and lockers. They slipped right into the roles and procedures with no difficulty. Meanwhile, despite having traveled and lived all over the world, I felt out of place in what was for everyone else an ordinary setting. Regardless, it didn\u0027t take me long to figure out how the school ran. Alchemists were trained to observe and adapt, and even though school was foreign to me, I quickly picked up on the routine. I wasn\u0027t afraid to talk to people either - I was used to striking up conversations with strangers and explaining my way out of situations. One thing, however, I knew I would have to work on. \"I heard her family might be moving to Anchorage.\" We were at orientation lunch, and a couple of freshmen girls sitting near me were discussing a friend of theirs who hadn\u0027t shown up today. The other girl\u0027s eyes widened. \"Seriously? I would die if I had to move there.\" \"I don\u0027t know,\" I mused, moving my food around my plate. \"With all the sun and UV rays here, it seems like Anchorage might actually provide a longer life span. You don\u0027t need as much sunblock, so it\u0027s a more economical choice as well.\" I\u0027d thought my comment was helpful, but when I looked up, I was met with gaping stares. It was obvious from the looks the girls were giving me that I probably couldn\u0027t have picked a weirder comment. \"I guess I shouldn\u0027t say everything that comes to mind,\" I murmured to Eddie. I was used to being direct in social situations, but it occurred to me that simply saying \"Yeah, totally!\" would\u0027ve probably been the correct response. I\u0027d had few friends my own age and was out of practice. Eddie grinned at me. \"I don\u0027t know, sis. You\u0027re pretty entertaining as you are. Keep it up.\" After lunch, our group returned to Central Campus, where we parted ways to meet with academic advisors and plan our class schedules. When I sat down with my advisor, a cheery young woman named Molly, I wasn\u0027t surprised to see that the Alchemists had sent along academic records from a fictitious school in South Dakota. They were even fairly consistent with what I had studied in my homeschooling. \"Your grades and tests have placed you in our most advanced math and English classes,\" Molly said. \"If you do well in them, you can receive college credit.\" Too bad there\u0027s no chance I\u0027ll get to go to college, I thought with a sigh. She flipped through a few pages in my file. \"Now, I don\u0027t see any records of foreign language here. It\u0027s an Amberwood requirement that everyone learn at least one language.\" Oops. The Alchemists had messed up there in faking my records. I\u0027d actually studied a number of languages. My father had made sure I had lessons from an early age, since an Alchemist never knew where he or she might end up. Scanning Amberwood\u0027s list of offered languages, I hesitated and wondered if I should lie. Then I decided I really didn\u0027t want to sit through conjugations and tenses I\u0027d already learned. \"I already know all of these,\" I told Molly. Molly regarded me skeptically. \"All of these? There are five languages here.\" I nodded and added helpfully, \"But I only studied Japanese for two years. So I suppose I could learn more.\" Molly still didn\u0027t seem to buy this. \"Would you be willing to take proficiency tests?\" And so, I ended up spending the rest of my afternoon laboring over foreign languages. It wasn\u0027t how I wanted to spend my day, but I supposed it would pay off later - the tests were a breeze. When I finally finished all five languages three hours later, Molly hurried me out to get fitted for my uniform. Most of the other new students had long gone through already, and she was concerned that I might have already missed the woman doing the fittings. I moved as fast as I could without running down the halls and nearly bumped into two girls rounding a corner. \"Oh!\" I exclaimed, feeling like an idiot. \"I\u0027m sorry - I\u0027m late for my fitting - \" One of them laughed good-naturedly. She was dark-skinned with an athletic build and wavy black hair. \"Don\u0027t worry about it,\" she said. \"We just walked past the room. She\u0027s still there.\" The other girl had blond hair a shade lighter than mine that she wore in a high ponytail. Both of them had the easy assurance of those who knew their way around this world. These weren\u0027t new students. \"Mrs. Delaney always takes longer than she thinks she will with the fittings,\" the blond girl said knowingly. \"Every year, it\u0027s - \" Her jaw dropped, her words freezing up for a few moments. \"Where... where did you get that?\" I had no clue what she meant, but the other girl soon noticed and leaned closer to me. \"That\u0027s amazing! Is that what they\u0027re doing this year?\" \"Your tattoo,\" explained the blonde. I must have still looked clueless. \"Where\u0027d you get it?\" \"Oh. That.\" My fingers absentmindedly touched my cheek. \"In, um, South Dakota. Where I\u0027m from.\" Both girls looked disappointed. \"I guess that\u0027s why I\u0027ve never seen it,\" said the dark-haired girl. \"I thought Nevermore was doing something new.\" \"Nevermore?\" I asked. The girls exchanged silent glances, and some message passed between them. \"You\u0027re new, right? What\u0027s your name?\" asked the blond girl. \"I\u0027m Julia. This is Kristin.\" \"Sydney,\" I said, still mystified. Julia was smiling again. \"Have lunch with us at East tomorrow, okay? We\u0027ll explain everything.\" \"Everything about what?\" I asked. \"It\u0027s a long story. Just get to Delaney for now,\" added Kristin, starting to move away. \"She\u0027ll stay late, but not forever.\" When they were gone, I continued on my way - much more slowly - wondering what that had been about. Had I just made friends? I really wasn\u0027t sure how one went about it in a school like this, but that whole exchange had seemed pretty weird. Mrs. Delaney was just packing up when I arrived. \"What size do you wear, dear?\" she asked, catching sight of me in the doorway. \"Two.\" A number of articles were produced: skirts, pants, blouses, and sweaters. I doubted the sweaters would see much wear, unless a freak apocalyptic blizzard hit Palm Springs. Amberwood wasn\u0027t particularly fussy about which ensemble students wore, as long as it came from the approved pool of fashion. The colors were burgundy, dark gray, and white, which I actually thought looked kind of nice together. Watching me button a white blouse, Mrs. Delaney tsked, \"I think you need a size four.\" I froze mid-button. \"I wear a two.\" \"Oh, yes, you can fit into them, but look at the arms and the skirt length. I think you\u0027ll be more comfortable in a four. Try these.\" She handed over a new stack and then laughed. \"Don\u0027t look so mortified, girl! A four\u0027s nothing. You\u0027re still a twig.\" She patted her ample stomach. \"We could fit three of you into my clothes!\" Despite my many protests, I was still sent away with the size-four clothing. I rode back to my dorm, dejected, and found Jill lying on her bed and reading. She sat up at my arrival. \"Hey, I wondered what had happened to you.\" \"Got delayed,\" I said with a sigh. \"Are you feeling better?\" \"Yeah. A lot.\" Jill watched as I put away the uniforms. \"They\u0027re pretty terrible, right? We didn\u0027t have uniforms at St. Vladimir\u0027s. It\u0027s going to be so boring wearing the same thing every day.\" I didn\u0027t want to tell her that as an Alchemist, I might have worn an outfit like this anyway. \"What size did you get?\" I asked, to change the subject. I was kind of a glutton for punishment. \"Two.\" A twinge of annoyance shot through me as I hung my uniforms in the closet beside hers. I felt huge by comparison. How were all those Moroi so skinny? Genetics? Low-carb blood diet? Maybe it was just because they were all so tall. All I knew was that whenever I spent time around them, I felt frumpy and awkward and wanted to eat less. When I finished unpacking, Jill and I compared schedules. Not surprisingly, considering the difference in grades, we had almost nothing in common. The only thing we shared was a multi-grade PE class. All students were required to take it every semester, since fitness was considered part of a wellrounded student\u0027s experience. Maybe I could lose a few pounds and get back into my normal size. Jill smiled and handed my schedule back. \"Eddie went and demanded to be in our PE class since it\u0027s pretty much the only one we could share. It conflicts with his Spanish class, though, and they wouldn\u0027t let him. I don\u0027t think he can handle going the whole school day without seeing that I\u0027m alive. Oh, and Micah\u0027s with us in PE.\" I\u0027d stalked off to my bed, still irritated about the uniforms. Jill\u0027s words caught my attention. \"Hey, do you know why Eddie seemed weirded out around Micah?\" Jill shook her head. \"No, I didn\u0027t get a chance to ask, but I noticed it too - especially at first. Later - while you were testing - and we were waiting for uniforms, Eddie seemed to chill out. A little. Every once in a while, I\u0027d see him giving Micah a strange look, though.\" \"You don\u0027t think he thinks Micah\u0027s dangerous, do you?\" Jill shrugged. \"He didn\u0027t seem dangerous to me, but I\u0027m no guardian. If Eddie did think he was some kind of threat, it seems like he\u0027d be acting differently. More aggressive. He mostly seems nervous around Micah. Almost - but not quite - afraid. And that\u0027s weirdest of all because guardians never look scared. Not that Eddie\u0027s technically a guardian. But you know what I mean.\" \"I do,\" I said, smiling despite my grumpy intentions. That cute, rambling nature cheered me up a little. \"What do you mean Eddie\u0027s technically not a guardian? Isn\u0027t he assigned to protect you here?\" \"Yeah, he is,\" said Jill, toying with one of her light brown curls. \"But... well, it\u0027s kind of weird. He got in some trouble with the guardians for helping Rose and for, um, killing a guy.\" \"He killed a Moroi that attacked Vasilisa, right?\" It had come up at my interrogation. \"Yeah,\" said Jill, lost in her own memories. \"It was self-defense - well, and defense of Lissa, but everyone was shocked at him killing a Moroi. Guardians aren\u0027t supposed to do that, but then, you know, Moroi aren\u0027t supposed to attack each other either. Anyway, he was put on suspension. No one knew what to do with him. When I got... attacked, Eddie helped protect me. Later, Lissa said it was stupid to keep him off duty when he could be helpful and that considering Moroi were behind this attack too, she said everyone was going to have to get used to the idea of Moroi being the enemy. Hans - the guardian in charge at Court - finally agreed and sent Eddie here with me, but I think officially, Eddie\u0027s not restored yet. It\u0027s weird.\" Jill had delivered the whole speech without pausing and now stopped to catch a breath. \"Well, I\u0027m sure it\u0027ll be sorted out,\" I said, trying to be reassuring. \"And it seems like he\u0027ll get points for keeping a princess alive.\" Jill looked at me sharply. \"I\u0027m no princess.\" I frowned and tried to remember the complexities of Moroi law. \"The prince or princess is the oldest member of a family. Since Vasilisa\u0027s queen, the title rolls over to you, right?\" \"On paper,\" said Jill, looking away. Her tone was hard to read, an odd mixture of what seemed like bitterness and sorrow. \"I\u0027m not a princess, not really. I\u0027m just someone who happens to be related to the queen.\" Jill\u0027s mother had briefly been mistress to Eric Dragomir, Vasilisa\u0027s father, and had kept Jill\u0027s existence a secret for years. It had only come out recently, and I\u0027d played a big role in helping Rose track Jill down. With all the fallout in my own life, as well as the emphasis on Jill\u0027s safety, I hadn\u0027t spent much time wondering how she had adapted to her new status. That had to be a serious lifestyle change. \"I\u0027m sure there\u0027s more to it than that,\" I said gently. I wondered if I was going to be spending a lot of time playing therapist to Jill during this assignment. The prospect of actually comforting a vampire still seemed so strange to me. \"I mean, you\u0027re obviously important. Everyone\u0027s gone to a lot of trouble to keep you safe here.\" \"But is it for me?\" asked Jill. \"Or is it to help Lissa keep the throne? She\u0027s hardly spoken to me since she found out we were sisters.\" This conversation was steering into uncomfortable waters, into interpersonal matters that I didn\u0027t really know how to deal with. I couldn\u0027t imagine being in either Vasilisa or Jill\u0027s place. The only thing I felt certain of was that it couldn\u0027t be easy for any of them. \"I\u0027m sure she cares about you,\" I said, though not really sure at all. \"But it\u0027s probably strange for her - especially with all the other changes in her life too. Give it time. Focus on the important things first - staying here and staying alive.\" \"You\u0027re right,\" said Jill. She lay back on her bed and stared up at the ceiling. \"I\u0027m nervous about tomorrow, about being around everyone, in classes all day. What if they notice? What if someone finds out the truth about me?\" \"You did fine at orientation,\" I assured her. \"Just don\u0027t show your fangs. And besides, I\u0027m pretty good at convincing people they didn\u0027t see what they think they saw.\" The grateful expression on her face reminded me uncomfortably of Zoe. They were so alike in many ways, shy and uncertain - yet intensely fierce and desperately wanting to prove themselves. I\u0027d tried to protect Zoe - and only failed in her eyes. Now, being here for Jill made me feel conflicted. In some ways, I could make up for what I hadn\u0027t been able to do for Zoe. Yet even as I thought that, some inner voice kept saying, Jill is not your sister. She\u0027s a vampire. This is business. \"Thanks, Sydney. I\u0027m glad you\u0027re here.\" She smiled, and the guilt only twisted further inside me. \"You know, I\u0027m kind of jealous of Adrian. He thinks it\u0027s so boring at Clarence\u0027s, but he doesn\u0027t have to worry about meeting new people or getting used to a new school. He just gets to hang out, watch TV, play pool with Lee, sleep in... it sounds amazing.\" She sighed. \"I suppose,\" I said, a little surprised at the detail. \"How do you know all that? Have you... have you talked to him since we left?\" Even as I said that, the idea seemed unlikely. I\u0027d been with her most of the day. The smile dropped from her face. \"Oh no. I mean, I just figure that\u0027s what\u0027s going on. He mentioned some of it earlier, that\u0027s all. Sorry. I\u0027m being melodramatic and rambling. Thanks for listening to me... it really does make me feel better.\" I smiled tightly and said nothing. I still couldn\u0027t get over the fact that I was starting to feel so warmly toward a vampire. First Rose, now Jill? It didn\u0027t matter how likable she was. I had to keep our relationship professional so that no Alchemist could accuse me of getting attached. Keith\u0027s words echoed in my head: vamp lover... That\u0027s ridiculous, I thought. There was nothing wrong with being nice to those in my care. It was normal, a far cry from \"getting too close\" to them. Right? Pushing my worries aside, I concentrated on finishing unpacking and thinking about our new life here. I sincerely hoped tomorrow would go as smoothly as I\u0027d assured Jill it would. Unfortunately, it didn\u0027t.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bloodlines-bloodlines-1/page-5.html","bookId":2041,"book":{"id":2041,"title":"Bloodlines (Bloodlines #1)","description":"Storyline: The first book in Richelle Mead\u0027s brand-new teen fiction series - set in the same world as Vampire Academy.
