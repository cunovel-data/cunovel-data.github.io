{"id":109471,"no":15,"title":"Page 15","content":"ADRIAN SLEPT for a lot of the way back to Palm Springs. Apparently, his late-night partying with Carla and Krissy had resulted in very little rest. Thinking about it made me uncomfortable. Thinking about Jill experiencing it through him made me ill.\n There\u0027d been little we could do for Carla and Krissy except offer our sympathies. Strigoi attacks happened. It was tragic and terrible, but the only way most Moroi could protect themselves was to exercise caution, keep their whereabouts secure, and stay with guardians if possible. For non-royal Moroi living and going to school in the world like Carla and Krissy were, guardians weren\u0027t an option. Plenty of Moroi got by like that; they just had to be careful. The two of them thought the circumstances surrounding their friend\u0027s death were awful. That was true. They were. But neither girl thought much past that or felt there was anything odd about the throat-slitting. I wouldn\u0027t have either if I hadn\u0027t heard Clarence\u0027s account of his niece\u0027s death.\n I brought Adrian back to Amberwood with me and signed him in briefly as a guest, figuring Jill would feel better about seeing him in the flesh. Sure enough, she was already waiting for us in the dorm when we arrived. She hugged him and flashed me a grateful look. Eddie was with her, and though he said nothing, there was a look of exasperation on his face that said I wasn\u0027t the only one who thought Adrian had behaved ridiculously.\n \"I was so worried,\" Jill said.\n Adrian ruffled her hair, which made her duck away. \"Nothing to worry about, Jailbait. So long as the wrinkles come out of this shirt, there\u0027s no harm done.\"\n No harm done, I thought, feeling anger kindle within me. No harm except Jill has to watch Adrian hook up with other girls and endure his drinking binges. It didn\u0027t matter if Lee had supplanted her old crush on Adrian. She was just too young to witness anything like that. Adrian had been selfish. \"Now,\" Adrian continued, \"if Sage would be kind enough to keep playing chauffeur, I\u0027ll take us all out to lunch.\"\n \"I thought you didn\u0027t have any money,\" I pointed out.\n \"I said I don\u0027t have very much money.\"\n Jill and Eddie exchanged looks. \"We, um, were going to meet Micah for lunch,\" Jill said.\n \"Bring him along,\" said Adrian. \"He can meet the family.\"\n Micah showed up shortly thereafter and was happy to meet our other \"brother.\" He shook Adrian\u0027s hand and smiled. \"Now I see some family resemblance. I was starting to wonder if Jill was adopted, but you two kind of look like each other.\"\n \"So does our mailman back in North Dakota,\" said Adrian.\n \"South,\" I corrected. Fortunately, Micah didn\u0027t seem to think there was anything weird about the slip.\n \"Right,\" said Adrian. He studied Micah thoughtfully. \"There\u0027s something familiar about you. Have we met?\"\n Micah shook his head. \"I\u0027ve never been to South Dakota.\"\n I was pretty sure I heard Adrian murmur, \"That makes two of us.\"\n \"We should go,\" said Eddie hastily, moving toward our dorm\u0027s door. \"I\u0027ve got some homework to catch up on later.\"\n I frowned, puzzled by the attitude change. Eddie wasn\u0027t a bad student by any means, but it had been obvious to me since coming to Amberwood that he didn\u0027t take the same interest in the school that I did. This was a repeated year for him, and he was content to just play along and only do what was necessary to stay in good standing.\n If anyone else thought his behavior was odd, they didn\u0027t show it. Micah was already talking to Jill about something, and Adrian still looked like he was trying to place Micah. Adrian\u0027s generous offer to buy lunch only extended to fast food, so our meal was quick. After a week of dorm food, though, I appreciated the change, and Adrian had long since made his views clear on Dorothy\u0027s \"healthy\" cooking.\n \"You should\u0027ve just gotten a kids\u0027 meal,\" Adrian told me, pointing to my half-eaten burger and fries. \"You could have saved me a lot of money. And gotten a toy.\"\n \u0027\"A lot\u0027 is kind of an exaggeration,\" I said. \"Besides, now you have leftovers to help get you by.\"\n He rolled his eyes and stole a fry off my plate. \"You\u0027re the one who should take the leftovers home. How do you even function on so little food?\" he demanded. \"One of these days, you\u0027re just going to blow away.\"\n \"Stop it,\" I said.\n \"Just telling it like it is,\" he said with a shrug. \"You could stand to gain about ten pounds.\"\n I stared at him incredulously, too shocked to even come up with a response. What did a Moroi know about weight gain? They had perfect figures. They didn\u0027t know what it was like to look in the mirror and see inadequacy, to never feel good enough. It was effortless for them, whereas no matter how hard I worked, I never seemed to match their inhuman perfection.\n Adrian\u0027s eyes drifted over to where Jill, Eddie, and Micah were animatedly talking about practicing more self-defense together.\n \"They\u0027re kind of cute,\" said Adrian in a voice pitched just for my ears. He played with his straw as he studied the group. \"Maybe Castile was on to something about letting her date at the school.\"\n \"Adrian,\" I groaned.\n \"Kidding,\" he said. \"Lee would probably challenge him to a duel. He couldn\u0027t stop talking about her, you know. When we got back from mini-golfing, Lee just kept going on with, \u0027When can we all go out again?\u0027 And yet, he dropped off the face of the earth when he was in LA and I needed him.\"\n \"Had you made plans to meet up?\" I asked. \"Had he agreed to take you home?\"\n \"No,\" Adrian admitted. \"But what else was he really doing?\"\n Just then, a gray-haired man passed by, bumping into Jill\u0027s chair as he balanced a tray of burgers and sodas. Nothing spilled, but Eddie jumped to his feet with lightning speed, ready to fly across the table and defend her. The man backed up and mumbled an apology.\n Adrian shook his head in amazement. \"Just send him as a chaperone with whoever she goes out with, and we\u0027ll never have to worry.\"\n Knowing what I knew now about Adrian and Jill\u0027s bond, I was able to regard Eddie\u0027s protectiveness in a different light. Oh, sure, I knew his guardian training had instilled that nature into him, but there always seemed to be something a little stronger there. Something almost... personal. At first, I\u0027d wondered if maybe it was because Jill was just part of his larger circle of friends, like Rose. Now, I kept thinking it might go further than that. Jill had said Eddie had been the only one to try to protect her the night of the attack. He\u0027d failed, most likely through timing and not because of a lack of skill.\n But what kind of mark must that have left on him? He was someone whose sole purpose in life was to defend others - and he\u0027d had to watch someone die on his watch. Now that Adrian had brought her back to life, was it almost like a second chance for Eddie? An opportunity to redeem himself? Maybe that\u0027s why he was so vigilant.\n \"You look confused,\" said Adrian.\n I shook my head and sighed. \"I think I\u0027m just overthinking things.\"\n He nodded solemnly. \"That\u0027s why I try to never do it.\"\n An earlier question popped into my head. \"Hey, how come you told those girls your name was Jet?\"\n \"Standard practice if you don\u0027t want chicks to find you later, Sage. Besides, I figured I was protecting our operation here.\"\n \"Yeah, but why Jet? Why not... I don\u0027t know... Travis or John?\"\n Adrian gave me a look that said I was wasting his time. \"Because Jet sounds badass.\"\n After lunch, we returned Adrian to Clarence\u0027s, and the rest of us went back to Amberwood. Jill and Micah went off to do their own thing, and I convinced Eddie to go to the library with me. There, we staked out a table, and I brought out my laptop.\n \"So, we found out something interesting when I picked up Adrian today,\" I told Eddie, keeping my voice library soft.\n Eddie gave me a wry look. \"I\u0027m guessing the whole experience of picking up Adrian was interesting - at least from what Jill told me.\"\n \"It could\u0027ve been worse,\" I speculated. \"At least he was dressed when I got there. And there were only two other Moroi there. I didn\u0027t stumble into a sorority house full of them or anything.\"\n That made him laugh. \"You might have had a harder time getting Adrian out of there if that was the case.\"\n My laptop screen flared to life, and I began the complicated process of logging into the Alchemists\u0027 mega-secure database.\n \"Well, as we were leaving, the girls he was with found out that a friend of theirs was killed by Strigoi the other night.\"\n All humor vanished from Eddie\u0027s face. His eyes went hard. \"Where?\"\n \"In LA, not here,\" I added. I should\u0027ve known better than to open up the conversation like that without clearly stating beforehand that he didn\u0027t need to be on the lookout for Strigoi on campus. \"As far as we know, everyone\u0027s right - Strigoi don\u0027t want to hang out in Palm Springs.\"\n Eddie became about one percent less tense.\n \"Here\u0027s the thing,\" I continued. \"This Moroi girl - this friend of theirs - was allegedly killed like Clarence\u0027s niece.\"\n Eddie\u0027s eyebrows rose. \"With the slit throat?\"\n I nodded.\n \"That\u0027s weird. Are you sure that\u0027s what happened - to either of them? I mean, we\u0027re just going off of Clarence\u0027s report, right?\" Eddie drummed a pencil against the table as he pondered this. \"Clarence is nice enough, but come on. We all know he\u0027s not quite there.\"\n \"That\u0027s why I brought you here. And why I wanted to check this database. We keep track of most Strigoi-related deaths.\"\n Eddie peered over my shoulder as I brought up an entry on Tamara Donahue from five years ago. Sure enough, she\u0027d been found with a cut throat. Another search on Melody Croft - Krissy and Carla\u0027s friend - also turned up a report from last night. My people had been on the scene and quick to log the information. Melody too had had her throat slit. There had been other reported Strigoi murders in LA - it was a big city, after all - but only two matched this profile.\n \"Are you still thinking about what Clarence said - about vampire hunters?\" Eddie asked me.\n \"I don\u0027t know. I just thought it was worth checking these out.\"\n \"Guardians weighed in on both of these cases,\" said Eddie, pointing at the screen. \"They also declared them Strigoi attacks - there was blood taken from both girls. That\u0027s what a Strigoi does. I don\u0027t know what a vampire hunter does, but I just don\u0027t see drinking blood as part of their goal.\"\n \"I wouldn\u0027t think so either. But neither of these girls was drained.\"\n \"Strigoi don\u0027t always finish drinking from their victims. Especially if they\u0027re interrupted. This girl Melody was killed near a club, right? I mean, if her killer heard someone coming, they\u0027d just take off.\"\n \"I suppose. But what about the throat-slitting?\"\n Eddie shrugged. \"We have tons of accounts of Strigoi doing crazy things. Just look at Keith and his eye. They\u0027re evil. You can\u0027t apply logic to them.\"\n \"Um, let\u0027s leave his eye out of this.\" Keith wasn\u0027t a case I wanted brought up. I sat back in my chair and sighed. \"There\u0027s just something bugging me about all the killings. The half-drinking. The throat-slitting. They\u0027re both strange things happening together. And I don\u0027t like strange things.\"\n \"Then you\u0027re in the wrong profession,\" said Eddie, his smile returning.\n I smiled back, my mind still turning everything over. \"I suppose so.\"\n When I didn\u0027t say anything else, he gave me a surprised look. \"You\u0027re not actually... you don\u0027t think there are vampire hunters, do you?\"\n \"No, not really. We have no evidence to think they exist.\"\n \"But...\" Eddie prompted.\n \"But,\" I said. \"Doesn\u0027t the idea freak you out a little? I mean, right now, you know who to look out for. Other Moroi. Strigoi. They stand out. But a human vampire hunter?\" I gestured to the students gathered and working in the library. \"You wouldn\u0027t know who\u0027s a threat.\"\n Eddie shook his head. \"It\u0027s pretty easy, actually. I just treat everyone as a threat.\"\n I couldn\u0027t decide if that made me feel better or not.\n When I returned to my dorm later, Mrs. Weathers flagged me down. \"Ms. Terwilliger dropped something off for you.\"\n \"She brought me something?\" I asked in surprise. \"It\u0027s not money, is it?\" So far, none of my coffee purchases had been reimbursed.\n By way of answer, Mrs. Weathers handed over a leather-covered book. At first, I thought it was the one I\u0027d just finished. Then I looked more closely at the cover and read Volume 2. A yellow sticky note attached to the book had Ms. Terwilliger\u0027s spidery writing on it: Next. I sighed and thanked Mrs.\n Weathers. I\u0027d do any task my teacher asked of me, but I was kind of hoping she\u0027d assign me a book that was more of a historical account than recipes for spells.\n As I was walking down my hall, I heard a few exclamations of alarm from the far end. I could see an open door and a few people huddled around it. Hurrying past my own room, I went to see what the problem was. It was Julia and Kristin\u0027s room. Although I wasn\u0027t sure I really had the right, I pushed my way past some of the frightened onlookers. No one stopped me.\n I found Kristin lying on her bed, twitching violently. She was sweating profusely, and her pupils were so large, there was hardly any discernible iris. Julia sat near her on the bed, as did a couple girls I didn\u0027t know so well. She looked up at my approach, her face filled with fear.\n \"Kristin?\" I cried. \"Kristin, are you okay?\" When no response came, I turned to the others. \"What\u0027s the matter with her?\"\n Julia anxiously refolded a wet cloth and placed it on Kristin\u0027s forehead. \"We don\u0027t know. She\u0027s been like this since this morning.\"\n I stared incredulously. \"Then she needs to see a doctor! We need to call someone now. I\u0027ll get Mrs. Weathers - \"\n \"No!\" Julia jumped up and caught hold of my arm. \"You can\u0027t. The reason she\u0027s like this... well, we think it\u0027s because of the tattoo.\"\n \"Tattoo?\"\n One of the other girls caught hold of Kristin\u0027s wrist and turned it so that I could see the inside. There, tattooed in glittering coppery ink on her dusky skin, was a daisy. I remembered Kristin pining for a celestial tattoo, but last I knew, she couldn\u0027t afford it. \"When did she get this?\"\n \"Earlier today,\" said Julia. She looked abashed. \"I lent her the money.\"\n I stared at that sparkling flower, so pretty and seemingly harmless. I had no doubt it was what was causing this fit. Whatever was mixed with the ink to provide the high wasn\u0027t reacting correctly with her system.\n \"She needs a doctor,\" I said firmly.\n \"You can\u0027t. We\u0027ll have to tell them about the tattoos,\" said the girl who had been holding Kristin\u0027s hand. \"No one believed Trey, but if they saw something like this... well, everything at Nevermore could be shut down.\"\n Good! I thought. But to my astonishment, her words were met with nods from the other gathered girls. Were they crazy? How many of them had those ridiculous tattoos? And was protecting them really more important than Kristin\u0027s life?\n Julia swallowed and sat back down on the edge of the bed. \"We were hoping this might pass. Maybe she needs a little time to adjust.\"\n Kristin moaned. One of her legs trembled like it was having a muscle spasm and then stilled. Her eyes and their large pupils stared off blankly, and her breathing was shallow.\n \"She\u0027s had all day!\" I pointed out. \"You guys, she could die.\"\n \"How do you know?\" asked Julia in astonishment.\n I didn\u0027t, not for sure. But every once in a while, Alchemist tattoos didn\u0027t take either. In ninety-nine percent of the cases, human bodies accepted the vampire blood used in an Alchemist tattoo, allowing its properties to infuse with our own, kind of like a low-grade dhampir. We gained good stamina and long life, though hardly got the amazing physical abilities dhampirs received. The blood was too diluted for that. Even so, there was always the occasional person who got sick from an Alchemist tattoo. The blood poisoned them. It was made worse because the gold and other chemicals worked to keep the blood infused in the skin, so it never had a chance to leave. Those left untreated died.\n Vampire blood wouldn\u0027t cause a euphoric high, so I didn\u0027t believe there was any in this tattoo. But the treatment we used for Alchemist tattoos relied on breaking down the metallic components of the tattoo in order to release the blood, allowing the body then to clear it naturally. I had to assume the same principle would work here. Only, I didn\u0027t know the exact formula for the Alchemist compound and wasn\u0027t even sure it would break down copper like it did gold.\n I bit my lip, thinking, and finally made a decision. \"I\u0027ll be right back,\" I told them, racing to my room. All the while, an inner voice chastised me for foolishness. I had no business attempting what I was about to. I should go straight to Mrs. Weathers.\n Instead, I opened my room door and found Jill with her laptop. \"Hey, Sydney,\" she said, smiling. \"I\u0027m IM-ing with Lee and - \" She did a double take.\n \"What\u0027s wrong?\"\n I turned on my own laptop and set it on the bed. While it booted up, I reached for a small metal suitcase I\u0027d carefully packed but never expected to use. \"Can you go get me some water? Quickly?\"\n Jill hesitated only a moment before nodding. \"Be right back,\" she said, jumping off her bed.\n While she was gone, I unlocked the case with a key I always kept on me. Inside it were small amounts of dozens of Alchemist compounds, the kinds of substances we mixed together and used as part of our jobs. Some ingredients - like the ones I used to dissolve Strigoi bodies - I had lots of. Others, I had only a sampling of. My laptop finished booting up, and I logged onto the Alchemist database. A few searches and I soon had the formula for antitattoo treatment pulled up.\n Jill returned then, carrying a cup brimming with water. \"Is this enough? If we were in any other climate, I could\u0027ve pulled it straight from the air.\" \"It\u0027s fine,\" I said, glad the climate had kept her from magic.\n I scanned the formula, analyzing which ingredients did what. I mentally deleted the ones I was certain were specific to gold. A couple I didn\u0027t even have, but I was pretty sure they were simply for skin comfort and weren\u0027t requisite. I began pulling out ingredients from my kit, carefully measuring them - though still moving as quickly as possible - into another cup. I made substitutions where necessary and added an ingredient I was certain would break down copper, though the amount required was only a guess on my part. When I finished, I took the water from Jill and added the same amount that was in the original instructions. The final result was a liquid that reminded me of iodine.\n I lifted it up and felt a little like a mad scientist. Jill had watched me without comment the entire time, sensing the urgency. Her face was filled with concern, but she was biting back all the questions I knew she had. She followed me when I left the room and headed back to Kristin\u0027s. More girls were there than before, and it was honestly a wonder Mrs. Weathers didn\u0027t just hear the racket. For a group so intent on protecting their precious tattoos, they weren\u0027t being particularly covert.\n I returned to Kristin\u0027s bedside, finding her unchanged. \"Expose her wrist again, and hold her arm as still as possible for me.\" I didn\u0027t direct the command to anyone but put enough force into it that I felt certain someone would obey. I was right. \"If this doesn\u0027t work, we get a doctor.\" My voice left no room for argument.\n Julia looked paler than Jill but gave a weak a nod of acceptance. I took the washcloth she\u0027d been using and dipped it into my cup. I\u0027d never actually seen this done and had to guess about how to apply it. I made a silent prayer and then pressed the washcloth against the tattoo on Kristin\u0027s wrist.\n She let out a strangled cry, and her whole body bucked up. A couple nearby girls instinctively helped hold her down. Tendrils of smoke curled up from where I was holding the washcloth against her, and I smelled a sharp, acrid odor. Waiting what I hoped was an acceptable amount of time, I finally removed the washcloth.\n The pretty little daisy was mutating before our eyes. Its clean lines began to run and blur. The coppery color began to shift, darkening into a bluish green. Before long, the design was unrecognizable. It was an amorphous blob. Around it, red welts appeared on her skin, though they seemed to be more of a superficial irritation than anything dire.\n Still, the whole thing looked terrible, and I stared in horror. What had I done?\n Everyone else was silent, no one knowing what to do. A couple minutes passed, but they felt like hours. Abruptly, Kristin stopped twitching. Her breathing still seemed labored, but she blinked, her eyes focusing as though suddenly seeing the world for the first time. Her pupils were still huge, but she managed to look around and at last focus on me.\n \"Sydney,\" gasped out Kristin. \"Thank you.\" \n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bloodlines-bloodlines-1/page-15.html","bookId":2041,"book":{"id":2041,"title":"Bloodlines (Bloodlines #1)","description":"Storyline: \n The first book in Richelle Mead\u0027s brand-new teen fiction series - set in the same world as Vampire Academy.
