{"id":109469,"no":12,"title":"Page 12","content":"WHEN WE LEFT on our group date or family outing or whatever it was, Lee couldn\u0027t stop apologizing for his father.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry,\" he said, slumping miserably in the backseat of Latte. \"There\u0027s no reasoning with him anymore. We tried to tell him that Tamara was killed by Strigoi, but he won\u0027t believe it. He doesn\u0027t want to. He can\u0027t take revenge on a Strigoi. They\u0027re immortal. Invincible. But some human vampire hunter? Somehow, in his head, that\u0027s something he can go after. And if he can\u0027t, then he can focus his energy on how the guardians won\u0027t go after these nonexistent vampire hunters.\"\\n\\n I just barely heard Eddie mutter, \"Strigoi aren\u0027t that invincible.\"\\n\\n In the rearview mirror, I saw Jill\u0027s face filled with compassion. She was seated between Lee and Eddie. \"Even if it\u0027s a fantasy, maybe it\u0027s better this way,\" she suggested. \"It gives him comfort. I mean, kind of. Having something tangible to hate is what gets him through. Otherwise he\u0027d just give in to despair. He\u0027s not hurting anyone with his theories. I think he\u0027s sweet.\" She caught her breath in that way she did when she\u0027d said a whole lot all at once. My eyes were back on the road, but I could swear Lee was smiling. \"That\u0027s nice of you,\" he told her. \"I know he likes having you around. Turn right up here.\"\\n\\n That was to me. Lee had been giving me directions ever since we left Clarence\u0027s. We were just outside of Palm Springs proper, nearing the very impressive-looking Desert Gods Golf Course and Resort. Further guidance from him led us to the Mega-Fun Mini-Golf Center, which was adjacent to the resort. I searched for a parking spot and heard Jill gasp when she caught sight of the golf course\u0027s crowning glory. There, in the center of a cluster of gaudily decorated putting greens, was a huge fake mountain with an artificial waterfall spouting from its top.\\n\\n \"A waterfall!\" she exclaimed. \"It\u0027s amazing.\"\\n\\n \"Well,\" said Lee, \"I wouldn\u0027t go that far. It\u0027s made of water that\u0027s been pumped over and over and has God only knows what in it. I mean, I wouldn\u0027t try to drink or swim in it.\"\\n\\n Before I even had the car to a stop, Adrian was out the door, lighting a cigarette. We\u0027d gotten in an argument on the way over, despite me telling him three times that Latte was a strictly no-smoking car. The rest of us soon got out as well, and I wondered what I\u0027d signed up for here as we strolled toward the entrance.\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve actually never been mini-golfing,\" I remarked.\\n\\n Lee came to a halt and stared. \"Never?\"\\n\\n \"Never.\"\\n\\n \"How does that happen?\" asked Adrian. \"How is it possible that you\u0027ve never played mini-golf?\"\\n\\n \"I had kind of an unusual childhood,\" I said at last.\\n\\n Even Eddie looked incredulous. \"You? I was practically raised at an isolated school in the middle of nowhere Montana, and even I\u0027ve played mini-golf.\" Saying I was homeschooled was no excuse this time, so I just let it go. Really, it just came down to having a childhood more focused on chemical equations than on fun and recreation.\\n\\n Once we started playing, I soon got the hang of it. My first few attempts were pretty bad, but I soon understood the weight of the club and how the angles on each course could be maneuvered. From there, it was pretty simple to calculate distance and force to make accurate shots.\\n\\n \"Unbelievable. If you\u0027d been playing since you were a child, you\u0027d be a pro by now,\" Eddie told me as I knocked my ball into a gaping dragon\u0027s mouth. The ball rolled out the back, down a tube, bounced off a wall, and into the hole. \"How\u0027d you do that?\"\\n\\n I shrugged. \"It\u0027s simple geometry. You\u0027re not that bad either,\" I pointed out, watching him make his shot. \"How do you do it?\"\\n\\n \"I just line it up and putt.\"\\n\\n \"Very scientific.\"\\n\\n \"I just rely on natural talent,\" said Adrian, strolling up to the start of the Dragon\u0027s Lair. \"When you have such a wealth of it to draw from, the danger comes from having too much.\"\\n\\n \"That makes no sense whatsoever,\" said Eddie.\\n\\n Adrian\u0027s response was to pause and take out a silver flask from his inner coat pocket. He unscrewed it and took a quick drink before leaning in to line up his shot.\\n\\n \"What was that?\" I exclaimed. \"You can\u0027t have alcohol out here.\"\\n\\n \"You heard Jailbait earlier,\" he countered. \"It\u0027s the weekend.\"\\n\\n He lined up his ball and shot. The ball went directly for the dragon\u0027s eye, bounced off it, and shot back toward Adrian. It rolled and came to a stop at his feet, nearly where it had started.\\n\\n \"Natural talent, huh?\" asked Eddie.\\n\\n I leaned forward. \"I think you broke the dragon\u0027s eye.\"\\n\\n \"Just like Keith,\" said Adrian. \"I figured you\u0027d appreciate that, Sage.\"\\n\\n I gave him a sharp look, wondering if there was any hidden meaning behind that. Mostly, Adrian seemed amused by his own wit. Eddie mistook my expression.\\n\\n \"That was inappropriate,\" he told Adrian.\\n\\n \"Sorry, Dad.\" Adrian shot again and managed not to maim any statues this time. A couple more shots, and he sank the ball. \"There we go. Three.\"\\n\\n \"Four,\" said Eddie and I in unison.\\n\\n Adrian looked at us incredulously. \"It was three.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re forgetting about your first one,\" I said. \"The one where you blinded the dragon.\"\\n\\n \"That was just the warm-up,\" Adrian argued. He put on a smile I think he hoped would charm me. \"Come on, Sage. You understand how my mind works. You said I was brilliant, remember?\"\\n\\n Eddie glanced at me in surprise. \"You did?\"\\n\\n \"No! I never said that.\" Adrian\u0027s smile was infuriating. \"Stop telling people that.\"\\n\\n Since I was in charge of the scorecard, his play was logged as four, despite his many further protests. I started to move forward, but Eddie held out a hand to stop me, his hazel eyes gazing over my shoulder.\\n\\n \"Hold up,\" he said. \"We need to wait for Jill and Lee.\"\\n\\n I followed his gaze. The two of them had been in deep conversation since we arrived, so much so that they\u0027d slowed and lagged behind the rest of us. Even during his bantering with Adrian and me, Eddie had continually checked on her - and our surroundings. It was kind of amazing the way he could multitask. Thus far, Jill and Lee had only been one hole behind us. Now it was nearly two, and that was too far for Eddie to keep her in his sight. So, we waited while the oblivious couple meandered their way toward the Dragon\u0027s Lair.\\n\\n Adrian took another drink from his flask and shook his head in awe. \"You had nothing to worry about, Sage. She went right for him.\"\\n\\n \"No thanks to you,\" I snapped. \"I can\u0027t believe you told her every detail of my visit that night. She was so mad at me for interfering behind her back with you, Lee, and Micah.\"\\n\\n \"I hardly told her anything,\" argued Adrian. \"I just told her to stay away from that human guy.\"\\n\\n Eddie glanced between our faces. \"Micah?\"\\n\\n I shifted uncomfortably. Eddie didn\u0027t know about how I\u0027d gone proactive. \"Remember when I wanted you to say something to him? And you wouldn\u0027t?\" I proceeded to tell him how I\u0027d then sought out Adrian\u0027s help and found out about Lee\u0027s interest in Jill. Eddie was aghast.\\n\\n \"How could you not tell me any of this?\" he demanded.\\n\\n \"Well,\" I said, wondering if everything I did was going to result in the wrath of a Moroi or dhampir, \"it didn\u0027t involve you.\"\\n\\n \"Jill\u0027s safety does! If some guy likes her, I need to know.\"\\n\\n Adrian chuckled. \"Should Sage have passed you a note in class?\"\\n\\n \"Lee\u0027s fine,\" I said. \"He obviously adores her, and it\u0027s not like she\u0027ll ever be alone with him.\"\\n\\n \"We don\u0027t know for sure that he\u0027s fine,\" said Eddie.\\n\\n \"Whereas Micah\u0027s a hundred percent okay? Did you do a background check or something?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"No,\" said Eddie, looking embarrassed. \"I just know. It\u0027s a feeling I get about him. There\u0027s no problem with him spending time with Jill.\"\\n\\n \"Except that he\u0027s human.\"\\n\\n \"They wouldn\u0027t have gotten serious.\"\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t know that.\"\\n\\n \"Enough, you two,\" interrupted Adrian. Jill and Lee had finally reached the start of the Dragon\u0027s Lair, meaning we could move on. Adrian lowered his voice. \"Your argument\u0027s useless. I mean, look at them. That human boy doesn\u0027t enter into it.\"\\n\\n I looked. Adrian was right. Jill and Lee were clearly enthralled with each other. Some guilty part of me wondered if I should be a doing a better job of looking out for Jill. I was so relieved that she was interested in a Moroi that I hadn\u0027t stopped to wonder if she should even be dating anyone. Was fifteen old enough? I hadn\u0027t dated at fifteen. I\u0027d actually, well, never dated.\\n\\n \"There is an age difference between them,\" I admitted, more to myself.\\n\\n Adrian scoffed. \"Believe me, I\u0027ve seen age differences. Theirs is nothing.\"\\n\\n He walked off, and a few moments later, Eddie and I went to join him. Eddie maintained his simultaneous vigil of Jill, but this time, I got the impression the danger he was watching out for was right beside her. Adrian\u0027s laughter rang out ahead of us.\\n\\n \"Sage!\" he called. \"You have got to see this.\"\\n\\n Eddie and I reached the next green and stared in astonishment. Then I burst out laughing.\\n\\n We had reached Dracula\u0027s Castle.\\n\\n A huge, multi-towered black castle guarded the hole some distance away. A tunnel was cut out through the center of it with a narrow bridge meant for the ball to go over. If the ball fell off the sides before getting through the castle, it was returned back to the starting point. An animatronic Count Dracula stood off to the castle\u0027s side. He was pure white, with red eyes, pointed ears, and slicked-back hair. He jerkily kept raising his arms to show off a batlike cape. Nearby, a speaker blasted eerie organ music.\\n\\n I couldn\u0027t stop laughing. Adrian and Eddie looked at me as though they\u0027d never seen me before.\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t think I\u0027ve ever heard her laugh,\" Eddie told him.\\n\\n \"Certainly not the reaction I was expecting,\" mused Adrian. \"I\u0027d been counting on abject terror, judging from past Alchemist behavior. I didn\u0027t think you liked vampires.\"\\n\\n Still grinning, I watched Dracula raise his cape up and down. \"This isn\u0027t a vampire. Not a real one. And that\u0027s what makes it so funny. It\u0027s pure Hollywood camp. Real vampires are terrifying and unnatural. This? This is hilarious.\"\\n\\n It was clear from their expressions that neither really understood why this would appeal to my sense of humor so much. Adrian did, however, offer to take a picture with my cell phone when I asked him. I posed by Dracula and put on a big smile. Adrian managed to snap the shot just as Dracula was raising his cape. When I viewed the picture, I was pleased to see it had come out perfectly. Even my hair looked good.\\n\\n Adrian gave the picture a nod of approval before handing me the phone. \"Okay, even I can admit that\u0027s pretty cute.\"\\n\\n I found myself overanalyzing the comment. What had he meant in saying even he could admit it? That I was cute for a human? Or that I had just met some kind of Adrian hot-girl criteria? Moments later, I had to forcibly stop thinking about it. Let it go, Sydney. It\u0027s a compliment. Accept it.\\n\\n We played through the rest of the course, finally finishing off with the waterfall itself. That was a particularly challenging hole, and I took my time lining up the shot - not that I needed to. I was beating everyone pretty handily. Eddie was the only one who came close. It was clear Jill and Lee didn\u0027t even have their attention on the game, and as for Adrian and his natural talent... well, they were very solidly in last place.\\n\\n Eddie, Adrian, and I were still ahead of the other two, so we waited for them by the waterfall. Jill practically ran to it when she had the chance, gazing up at it with enchanted eyes. \"Oh,\" she breathed. \"This is wonderful. I haven\u0027t seen this much water in days.\"\\n\\n \"Remember what I said about the toxicity,\" teased Lee. But it was clear he found her reaction endearing. As I glanced at the other two guys, I saw that they shared the same feelings. Well, not exactly the same. Adrian\u0027s affection was clearly brotherly. Eddie\u0027s? It was hard to read, kind of a mix of the other two. Maybe it was a kind of guardian fondness.\\n\\n Jill made a gesture to the waterfall, and suddenly, part of it broke off from the tumbling cascade. The chunk of water shaped itself into a braid, then twisted high into the air, making spirals before shattering into a million drops that misted over us all. I had been staring wide-eyed and frozen, but those drops hitting me shocked me awake.\\n\\n \"Jill,\" I said in a voice I barely recognized as my own. \"Don\u0027t do that again.\"\\n\\n Jill, eyes bright, barely spared me a glance as she made another piece of water dance in the air. \"No one\u0027s around to see, Sydney.\" That wasn\u0027t what had me so upset. That wasn\u0027t what filled me with so much panic that I could barely breathe. The world was doing that thing where it started to spin, and I worried I was going to faint. Stark, cold fear ran through me, fear at the unknown. The unnatural. The laws of my world had just been broken. This was vampire magic, something foreign and inaccessible to humans - inaccessible because it was forbidden, something no mortal was meant to delve into. I had only once seen magic used, when two spirit users had turned on each other, and I never wanted to see it again. One had forced the plants of the earth to do her bidding while the other telekinetically hurled objects meant to kill. It had been terrifying, and even though I hadn\u0027t been the target, I\u0027d felt trapped and overwhelmed in the face of such otherworldly power. It was a reminder that these weren\u0027t fun, easy people to hang out with.\\n\\n These were creatures wholly different from me.\\n\\n \"Stop it,\" I said, feeling the panic rise. I was afraid of the magic, afraid it would touch me, afraid of what it might do to me. \"Don\u0027t do it anymore!\" Jill didn\u0027t even hear me. She grinned at Lee. \"You\u0027re air, right? Can you create fog over the water?\"\\n\\n Lee stuffed his hands in his pockets and looked away. \"Ah, well, it\u0027s probably not a good idea. I mean, we\u0027re in public...\"\\n\\n \"Come on,\" she pleaded. \"It won\u0027t take any effort for you at all.\"\\n\\n He actually appeared nervous. \"Nah, not right now.\"\\n\\n \"Not you too.\" She laughed. Above her and in front of her, that demon water was still spinning, spinning, spinning...\\n\\n \"Jill,\" said Adrian, a harsher note in his voice than I\u0027d ever heard before. In fact, I couldn\u0027t recall him ever addressing her by her actual name. \"Stop.\" It was all he said, but it was like a wave of something went through Jill. She flinched, and the water spirals disappeared, falling away in droplets. \"Fine,\" she said, looking confused.\\n\\n There was a moment of awkwardness, and then Eddie said, \"We should hurry. We\u0027re going to be pushing curfew.\"\\n\\n Lee and Jill set out to make their shots and soon were laughing and flirting again. Eddie continued watching them in his concerned way. Only Adrian paid any attention to me. He was the only one who really understood what had happened, I realized. His green eyes studied me, with no trace of their usual bitter humor. I wasn\u0027t fooled, though. I knew there had to be some witty quip coming, mocking my reaction.\\n\\n \"Are you okay?\" he asked quietly.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m fine,\" I said, turning from him. I didn\u0027t want him to see my face. He\u0027d already seen too much, seen my fear. I didn\u0027t want any of them to know how afraid of them I was. I heard him take a few steps toward me.\\n\\n \"Sage - \"\\n\\n \"Leave me alone,\" I snapped back. I hurried off toward the course\u0027s exit, certain he wouldn\u0027t follow me. I was right. I waited for them to finish the game, using the alone time to calm myself down. By the time they caught up to me, I was fairly certain I had wiped most of the emotions from my face. Adrian still watched me with concern, which I didn\u0027t like, but at least he didn\u0027t say anything else about my breakdown.\\n\\n Surprising to no one, the final score showed that I had won and Adrian had lost. Lee had come in third, which seemed to trouble him. \"I used to be a lot better,\" he muttered, frowning. \"I used to be perfect at this game.\" Considering he\u0027d spent most of the time paying attention to Jill, I thought third was a pretty respectable performance.\\n\\n I dropped him and Adrian off first and then just barely got Eddie, Jill, and me back to Amberwood on time. I was more or less back to normal by then, not that anyone would\u0027ve noticed. Jill was floating on a cloud as we went into our dorm room, talking nonstop about Lee.\\n\\n \"I had no idea he\u0027d traveled so much! He\u0027s maybe been more places than you, Sydney. He keeps telling me that he\u0027ll take me to all of them, that we\u0027ll spend the rest of our lives traveling and doing whatever we want. And he\u0027s taking all sorts of classes in college because he\u0027s not sure what he wants to major in. Well, not all sorts this semester. He\u0027s got a light schedule so that he can spend more time with his father. And that\u0027s good for me. For us, I mean.\"\\n\\n I stifled a yawn and nodded wearily. \"That\u0027s great.\"\\n\\n She paused from where she\u0027d been searching her dresser for pajamas. \"I\u0027m sorry, by the way.\"\\n\\n I froze. I didn\u0027t want an apology for the magic. I didn\u0027t even want to remember it had happened.\\n\\n \"For yelling at you the other night,\" she continued. \"You didn\u0027t set me up with Lee. I should never have accused you of interfering. He really has liked me all along, and, well... he\u0027s really great.\"\\n\\n I let out the breath I\u0027d been holding and attempted a weak smile. \"I\u0027m glad you\u0027re happy.\"\\n\\n She returned cheerfully to her tasks and to talking about Lee until I left to go down to the bathroom. Before brushing my teeth, I stood in front of the sink and washed my hands and arms over and over, scrubbing as hard as I could to wash away the magical drops of water I swore I could still feel on my skin. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bloodlines-bloodlines-1/page-12.html","bookId":2041,"book":{"id":2041,"title":"Bloodlines (Bloodlines #1)","description":"Storyline: The first book in Richelle Mead\u0027s brand-new teen fiction series - set in the same world as Vampire Academy.
