{"id":109473,"no":17,"title":"Page 17","content":"MY DISCOVERY KICKED the tattoo problem up to a whole new level. Before, I\u0027d just thought I was fighting against people using techniques similar to Alchemist methods to expose Amberwood to drugs. It had been a moral issue. Now, with blood on the line - it was an Alchemist issue. Our whole purpose was to protect humans from the existence of vampires. If someone was illicitly putting vampire blood into humans, they\u0027d crossed the line we worked hard, every day, to maintain. I knew I should immediately report this. If someone had gotten their hands on vampire blood, the Alchemists needed to send a force here and investigate. If I followed the normal chain of command, I supposed the thing would be to tell Keith and let him tell our superiors. If he did, however, I had no doubt he\u0027d claim all the credit for uncovering this. I couldn\u0027t let that happen - and not because I wanted the glory for myself. Too many Alchemists erroneously believed Keith was an upstanding person. I didn\u0027t want to fuel that. But before I did anything, I needed to figure out the rest of the vials\u0027 contents. I could make guesses at the metallic residues but wasn\u0027t sure if, like the blood, they came straight from the Alchemist catalog or were just knockoffs. And if they were our formulas, it wasn\u0027t obvious at a glance which were which. The silver powder in one vial, for example, could have been a few different Alchemist compounds. I had the means to do some experiments and figure it out, but one substance eluded me. It was clear, slightly thick liquid that had no discernable odor. My guess was that it was the narcotic used in the celestial tattoos. Vampire blood wouldn\u0027t cause that high, though it would absolutely explain the crazy athleticism of the so-called steel tattoos. So, I began running what experiments I could, while going on with the normal routines of school. We were playing basketball inside in PE this week, so Jill was participating - and being subjected to Laurel\u0027s biting comments. I kept hearing her say things like, \"You\u0027d think she\u0027d be a lot better since she\u0027s so tall. She can practically touch the basket without jumping. Or maybe she should turn into a bat and fly up there.\" I winced. I had to keep telling myself not to make a big deal of the jokes, but every time I heard one, panic seized me. I had to hide it, though. If I wanted to help Jill, I needed the teasing stopped as a whole - not just the vampire stuff. Drawing more attention to those comments wouldn\u0027t help. Micah tried to comfort Jill after each attack, which clearly infuriated Laurel more. Laurel\u0027s weren\u0027t the only comments reaching my ears. Since my raid of the tattoo parlor, I\u0027d been hearing a fair amount of interesting information from Slade and his friends. \"Well, did he say when?\" Miss Carson was taking attendance, and Slade was interrogating a guy named Tim about a recent trip to the parlor. Tim shook his head. \"No. They\u0027re having some trouble with their shipment. It sounds like the supplier\u0027s got it but doesn\u0027t want to give it up for the same price.\" \"Damn it,\" growled Slade. \"I need a touch-up.\" \"Hey,\" said Tim. \"What about me? I don\u0027t even have my first one.\" It wasn\u0027t the first comment I\u0027d overheard from someone who already had a celestial and needed a touch-up. Addiction in action. Jill\u0027s face was hard when PE ended, and I had the feeling she was trying not to cry. I tried talking to her in the locker room, but she simply shook her head and headed off for the showers. I was about to go there myself when I heard a shriek. Those of us who were still by the lockers raced to the shower room to see what was happening. Laurel jerked the curtain back from her stall and came running out, oblivious to the fact that she was naked. I gaped. Her skin was covered in a fine sheen of ice. Water droplets from the shower had frozen solid on her skin and in her hair, though in the steamy heat of the rest of the room, they were already starting to melt. I glanced over to the shower itself and noticed that the water coming out of the faucet was also frozen solid. Laurel\u0027s screams brought Miss Carson running in - shocked as the rest of us at the seemingly impossible thing we\u0027d just witnessed. She finally declared it was some kind of freak problem with the pipes and the water heater. That was typical of my fellow humans. They\u0027d always reach for far-fetched scientific explanations before delving into fantastic ones. But I had no problem with that. It made my job easier. Miss Carson tried to get Laurel to go into a different shower to get the ice off, but she refused. She waited for it all to melt and then toweled herself off. Her hair was atrocious when she finally left for her next class, and I smirked. I guessed there\u0027d be no hair-tossing today. \"Jill,\" I called, catching sight of her trying to blend in to the group of girls leaving the locker room. She glanced guiltily over her shoulder but didn\u0027t otherwise acknowledge that she\u0027d heard me. I followed close behind her. \"Jill!\" I called out again. She was definitely avoiding me. In the hall, Jill spotted Micah and hurried over to him. Smart. She knew I wouldn\u0027t ask any dangerous questions with him around. She managed to avoid me for the rest of the day, but I staked out our room until she finally came home, just before curfew. \"Jill,\" I exclaimed as soon as she walked through the door. \"What were you thinking?\" She threw her books down and turned toward me. I had a feeling I wasn\u0027t the only one who\u0027d been preparing a speech today. \"I was thinking I\u0027m sick of listening to Laurel and her friends talk about me.\" \"So you froze her shower?\" I asked. \"How is that going to stop her? It\u0027s not like you can claim credit for it.\" Jill shrugged. \"It made me feel better.\" \"That\u0027s your excuse?\" I could hardly believe it. Jill had always seemed so reasonable. She\u0027d survived becoming a princess and dying with a clear head. This was what broke her. \"Do you know what you risked? We\u0027re trying to not attract attention here!\" \"Miss Carson didn\u0027t think it was weird.\" \"Miss Carson came up with a flimsy excuse to reassure herself! That\u0027s what people do. All it\u0027s going to take is some janitor investigating and saying pipes don\u0027t randomly freeze - especially in Palm Springs!\" \"So what?\" Jill demanded. \"What then? Is their next leap going to be that it was vampire magic?\" \"Of course not,\" I said. \"But people are going to talk. You\u0027ve raised their suspicions.\" She eyed me carefully. \"Is that what\u0027s really upsetting you? Or is it that I used magic at all?\" \"Isn\u0027t it the same thing?\" \"No. I mean, you\u0027re upset that I used magic because you don\u0027t like magic. You don\u0027t like anything to do with vampires. I think this is personal. I know what you think of us.\" I groaned. \"Jill, I do like you. You\u0027re right that magic makes me a little uneasy.\" Okay, a lot uneasy. \"But my personal feelings aren\u0027t what\u0027s going to make people wonder what could have caused water to freeze like that.\" \"It isn\u0027t right that she can keep doing that!\" \"I know. But you have to be better than her.\" Jill sat on the bed and sighed. Like that, her anger seemed to melt into despair. \"I hate it here. I want to go back to St. Vladimir\u0027s. Or Court. Or Michigan. Anywhere but here.\" She looked at me pleadingly. \"Hasn\u0027t there been any news about when I can go back?\" \"No,\" I said, unwilling to tell her it might be a while. \"Everyone\u0027s having a great time here,\" she said. \"You love it. You have tons of friends.\" \"I don\u0027t - \" \"Eddie likes it too. He\u0027s got Micah and some other guys in their dorm to hang out with. Plus, he\u0027s got me to look after, which gives him a purpose.\" I\u0027d never thought of it like that but realized she was right. \"But me? What do I have? Nothing except this stupid bond that just makes me more depressed because I have to listen to Adrian feel sorry for himself.\" \"I\u0027m taking Adrian job-hunting tomorrow,\" I said, not sure if that would really help. Jill nodded bleakly. \"I know. His life\u0027ll probably be great now too.\" She was sinking into melodrama and her own self-pity, but in light of everything, I kind of felt like she was entitled to it right now. \"You have Lee,\" I said. That brought a smile to her face. \"I know. He\u0027s great. I like him a lot, and I can\u0027t believe... I mean, it just seems crazy that he\u0027d like me too.\" \"Not that crazy.\" Her brightness faded. \"Did you know Lee told me he thinks I can be a model? He says I\u0027ve got the figure human fashion designers really like and knows this designer downtown who\u0027s looking for models. But when I told Eddie, he said it was a terrible idea because I can\u0027t risk having my picture taken. He said if it leaked out, others could find me.\" \"That\u0027s true,\" I said. \"On all counts. You do have a model\u0027s figure - but it\u0027d be too dangerous.\" She sighed, looking defeated. \"See? Nothing works out for me.\" \"I\u0027m sorry, Jill. I really am. I know it\u0027s hard. All I can ask is that you keep trying to stay strong. You\u0027ve done really great so far. Just hang in there a little longer, okay? Just keep thinking of Lee.\" My words sounded hollow, even to me. I almost wondered if I should bring her along with Adrian and me but finally decided against it. I didn\u0027t think Adrian needed any distractions. I also wasn\u0027t sure how interesting it would be for her. If she was really that eager to watch Adrian go through job interviews, she could \"listen in\" through the bond. I met up with Adrian after school the next day, and for the first time in ages, neither Lee nor Keith was around the old house. Clarence was, however, and he practically ran me down when I entered. \"Did you hear?\" he demanded. \"Did you hear about that poor girl?\" \"What girl?\" I asked. \"The one killed in Los Angeles a couple weeks ago.\" \"Oh, yeah,\" I said, relieved there was no new death. \"It was tragic. We\u0027re lucky there are no Strigoi here.\" He gave me a surprisingly knowing look. \"It wasn\u0027t Strigoi! Haven\u0027t you paid attention? It was them. The vampire hunters.\" \"But they drank her blood, sir. Didn\u0027t you say vampire hunters are human? No human would have any reason to drink Moroi blood.\" He turned away from me and paced the living room. I glanced around, wondering where Adrian was. \"Everyone keeps saying that!\" said Clarence. \"As though I don\u0027t already know that. I can\u0027t explain why they do what they do. They\u0027re a strange lot. They worship the sun and have weird beliefs about evil and honor - more unusual than even your beliefs.\" Well, that was something. At least he knew I was human. Sometimes I wasn\u0027t sure. \"They also have strange views on which vampires should die. They kill all Strigoi without question. With Moroi and dhampirs, they\u0027re more selective.\" \"You sure know a lot about them,\" I said. \"I\u0027ve made it my business to, ever since Tamara.\" He sighed and suddenly seemed very, very old. \"At least Keith believes me.\" I kept my face expressionless. \"Oh?\" Clarence nodded. \"He\u0027s a good young man. You should give him a chance.\" My control slipped, and I knew I was scowling. \"I\u0027ll try, sir.\" Adrian entered just then, much to my relief. Being alone with Clarence was freaky enough without him actually praising Keith Darnell. \"Ready?\" I asked. \"You bet,\" said Adrian. \"I can\u0027t wait to be a productive member of society.\" I gave his outfit a once-over and had to bite off any comments. It was nice, but of course, his clothes always were. Jill had claimed I had an expensive wardrobe, but Adrian\u0027s blew mine away. Today he wore black jeans and a burgundy button-down shirt. The shirt looked like it was some sort of silk blend, and he wore it loose and unbuttoned. His hair was carefully styled to look like he\u0027d just rolled out of bed. Too bad he didn\u0027t have my hair\u0027s texture. My hair did that without any styling at all. I had to admit, he looked great - but he didn\u0027t look like he was going to a job interview. He looked like he was about to go clubbing. This left me kind of conflicted. I found myself admiring him nonetheless and was again reminded of that impression I got from him sometimes, like he was some kind of work of art. It was a little disconcerting, particularly since I had to keep telling myself that vampires were not attractive in the same way humans were. Fortunately, the practical part of me soon took over, chastising me that it didn\u0027t matter if he looked good or not. What mattered was that he looked inappropriate for job interviews. I shouldn\u0027t have been surprised, though. This was Adrian Ivashkov. \"So what\u0027s on the agenda?\" he asked me once we were on the road. \"I really think \u0027Chairman Ivashkov\u0027 has a nice ring to it.\" \"There\u0027s a folder in the backseat with our itinerary, Chairman.\" Adrian twisted around and retrieved the folder. After a quick scan of it, he declared, \"You get points for variety, Sage. But I don\u0027t think any of these are going to keep me in the lifestyle I\u0027m accustomed to.\" \"Your resume\u0027s in the back. I did my best, but we\u0027re operating within limited parameters here.\" He flipped through the papers and found the resume. \"Wow. I was an educational assistant at St. Vladimir\u0027s?\" I shrugged. \"It was the closest you had to a job.\" \"And Lissa was my supervisor, huh? I hope she gives me a good referral.\" When Vasilisa and Rose were still in school, Adrian had lived there and worked with Vasilisa on learning spirit. \"Educational assistant\" was kind of a stretch, but it made him sound like he could multitask and show up for work on time. He shut the folder and leaned back against the seat, closing his eyes. \"How\u0027s Jailbait? She seemed down the last time I saw her.\" I considered lying but figured he\u0027d probably find out the truth eventually, either from her directly or through his own deductions. Adrian\u0027s judgment might be questionable, but I\u0027d discovered he was excellent at reading people. Eddie claimed it came from being a spirit user and had mentioned something about auras, which I wasn\u0027t quite sure I believed in. The Alchemists had no hard evidence that they were real. \"Not good,\" I said, giving him the full report as we drove. \"That shower thing was hilarious,\" he said when I finished. \"It was irresponsible! Why can\u0027t anyone see that?\" \"But that bitch had it coming.\" I sighed. \"Have you guys forgotten why you\u0027re here? You of all people! You saw her die. Don\u0027t you get how important it is for her to stay safe and keep a low profile?\" Adrian was quiet for several moments, and when I glanced over, his face was uncharacteristically serious. \"I know. But I don\u0027t want her to be miserable either. She... she doesn\u0027t deserve it. Not like the rest of us.\" \"I don\u0027t think we do either.\" \"Maybe you don\u0027t,\" he said with a small smile. \"What with your pure lifestyle and all. I don\u0027t know. Jill\u0027s just so... innocent. It\u0027s why I saved her, you know. I mean, part of it.\" I shivered. \"When she died?\" He nodded, a troubled look in his eyes. \"When I saw her there, bloody and not moving... I didn\u0027t think about the consequences of what I was doing. I just knew I had to save her. She had to live. I acted without question, not even knowing for sure if I could do it.\" \"It was brave of you.\" \"Maybe. I don\u0027t know. I do know she\u0027s gone through a lot. I don\u0027t want her to go through any more.\" \"Neither do I.\" I was touched at the concern. He kept surprising me in weird ways. Sometimes it was hard to imagine Adrian really caring about anything, but a softer side of him surfaced when he talked about Jill. \"I\u0027ll do what I can. I know I should talk to her more... be more of a friend or even a fake sister. It\u0027s just...\" He eyed me. \"Is it really so terrible being around us?\" I blushed. \"No,\" I said. \"But... it\u0027s complicated. I\u0027ve been taught certain things my entire life. Those are hard to shake.\" \"The greatest changes in history have come because people were able to shake off what others told them to do.\" He looked away from me, out the window. The statement annoyed me. It sounded good, of course. It was the kind of thing people said all the time without really understanding the implications. Be yourself, fight the system! But people who said them - people like Adrian - hadn\u0027t lived my life. They hadn\u0027t grown up in a system of beliefs so rigid, it was like being imprisoned. They hadn\u0027t been forced to give up their ability to think for themselves or make their own choices. His words didn\u0027t just annoy me, I realized. They made me angry. They made me jealous. I scoffed and threw out a comment worthy of him. \"Should I add motivational speaker to your resume?\" \"If the pay\u0027s right, I\u0027m in. Oh.\" He straightened up. \"I finally placed him. That Micah guy you\u0027re so worried about.\" \"Placed him?\" \"Yeah. Why he looks so familiar. Micah\u0027s a dead ringer for Mason Ashford.\" \"Who?\" \"A dhampir that went to St. Vladimir\u0027s. He dated Rose for a while.\" Adrian scoffed and rested his cheek against the glass. \"Well, inasmuch as anyone ever dated her. She was crazy for Belikov, even then. Just like she was when we dated. Don\u0027t know if Ashford ever knew or if she was able to fool him the whole time. I hope so. Poor bastard.\" I frowned. \"Why do you say that?\" \"He died. Well, was killed, I should say. Did you know about that? A bunch of them were captured by Strigoi last year. Rose and Castile made it out. Ashford didn\u0027t.\" \"No,\" I said, making a mental note to look into this. \"I didn\u0027t. Eddie was there too?\" \"Yup. Physically, at least. The Strigoi kept feeding off him, so he was useless for most of it. You want to talk about emotional damage? Look no further.\" \"Poor Eddie,\" I said. Suddenly, a lot about the dhampir was beginning to make sense to me. We arrived at the first place, a law firm that was looking for an office assistant. The title sounded more glamorous than it really was and would probably involve a lot of the same errands Trey and I ran for Ms. Terwilliger. But out of the three positions I\u0027d found, this one also had the most potential for future advancement. The firm was obviously doing well, judging from the lobby we waited in. Orchids grew in giant, well-placed vases, and there was even a fountain in the middle of the room. Three others waited in the lobby with us. One was a very nicely dressed woman in her forties. Opposite her was a man about the same age, sitting with a much younger woman whose lowcut blouse would\u0027ve gotten her thrown out of Amberwood. Each time I looked at her, I wanted to cover her cleavage up with a cardigan. The three of them obviously knew each other, however, because they kept making eye contact and trading glares. Adrian studied each of them in turn and then turned to me. \"This law firm,\" he said in a low voice. \"It specializes in divorce, doesn\u0027t it?\" \"Yes,\" I said. He nodded and took a few moments to process the information. Then, to my horror, he leaned over me and said to the older woman, \"He was a fool, clearly. You\u0027re a stunning, classy woman. Just wait. He\u0027ll be sorry.\" \"Adrian!\" I exclaimed. The woman flinched in surprise but didn\u0027t look entirely offended. Meanwhile, on the other side of the room, the younger woman straightened up from where she\u0027d been cuddling against the man. \"Sorry?\" she demanded. \"What\u0027s that supposed to mean?\" I willed the earth to swallow me up and save me. Fortunately, the next-best thing came when the receptionist called the threesome in to meet with a lawyer. \"Really?\" I asked when they were gone. \"Did you have to say that?\" \"I speak my mind, Sage. Don\u0027t you believe in telling the truth?\" \"Of course I do. But there\u0027s a time and place! Not with perfect strangers who are obviously in a bad situation.\" \"Whatever,\" he said, looking extremely pleased with himself. \"I totally made that lady\u0027s day.\" Just then, a woman in a black suit and very high heels emerged from an inner office. \"I\u0027m Janet McCade, the office manager,\" she said. She glanced between the two of us uncertainly, and then she decided on me. \"You must be Adrian.\" The name mistake was understandable, but the mix-up didn\u0027t bode well for him. My assessment of his clubbing outfit had been correct. My brown skirt and ivory blouse apparently seemed more appropriate for an interview. \"This is Adrian,\" I said, pointing. \"I\u0027m just his sister, here for moral support.\" \"Very kind of you,\" said Janet, looking a little perplexed. \"Well, then. Shall we go talk, Adrian?\" \"You bet,\" he said, standing. He started to follow her, and I jumped up. \"Adrian,\" I whispered, catching his sleeve. \"You want to tell the truth? Do it in there. Do not embellish or make up crazy claims that you were a district attorney.\" \"Got it,\" he said. \"This is going to be a breeze.\" If by breeze he meant fast, then he was right. He emerged from the office door five minutes later. \"I don\u0027t suppose,\" I said, once we were in the car, \"that she just gave you the job based on looks alone?\" Adrian had been staring off but now flashed me a big smile. \"Why, Sage, you sweet talker.\" \"That\u0027s not what I meant! What happened?\" He shrugged. \"I told the truth.\" \"Adrian!\" \"I\u0027m serious. She asked me what my greatest strength was. I said getting along with people.\" \"That\u0027s not bad,\" I admitted. \"Then she asked what my greatest weakness was. And I said, \u0027Where should I start?\u0027\" \"Adrian!\" \"Stop saying my name like that. I told her the truth. By the time I was on the fourth one, she told me I could go.\" I groaned and resisted the urge to beat my head on the steering wheel. \"I should\u0027ve coached you. That\u0027s a standard trick question. You\u0027re supposed to answer with things like \u0027I get too devoted to my work\u0027 or \u0027I\u0027m a perfectionist.\u0027\" He snorted and crossed his arms. \"That\u0027s total bullshit. Who\u0027d say something like that?\" \"People who get jobs.\" Since we had extra time now, I did my best to prep him with answers before the next interview. It was actually at Spencer\u0027s, and I\u0027d gotten Trey to pull a few strings. While Adrian was interviewing in the back, I got a table and some coffee. Trey came to visit me after about fifteen minutes. \"Is that really your brother?\" he demanded. \"Yes,\" I said, hoping I sounded convincing. \"When you said he was looking for a job, I pictured a male version of you. I figured he\u0027d want to color code the cups or something.\" \"What\u0027s your point?\" I asked. Trey shook his head. \"My point is that you\u0027d better keep looking. I was just back there and overhead him talking with my manager. She was explaining the cleanup he would have to do each night. Then he said something about his hands and manual labor.\" I wasn\u0027t the swearing type, but in that moment, I wished I was. The last interview was at a trendy bar downtown. I\u0027d taken it on faith that Adrian probably knew every drink in the world and had made up a fake credential for the resume, claiming he\u0027d taken a bartending class. I stayed in the car for this one and sent him in alone, figuring he had the best chance here. At the very least, his outfit would be appropriate. When he came out in ten minutes, I was aghast. \"How?\" I demanded. \"How could you have screwed this one up?\" \"When I got in, they said the manager was on the phone and would be a few minutes. So, I sat down and ordered a drink.\" This time, I did lean my forehead against the steering wheel. \"What did you order?\" \"A martini.\" \"A martini.\" I lifted my head. \"You ordered a martini before a job interview.\" \"It\u0027s a bar, Sage. I figured they\u0027d be cool with it.\" \"No, you didn\u0027t!\" I exclaimed. The volume of my voice surprised both of us, and he cringed a little. \"You aren\u0027t stupid, no matter how much you pretend to be! You know you can\u0027t do that. You did it to screw around with them. You did it to screw around with me! That\u0027s what this has all been about. You haven\u0027t taken any of this seriously. You wasted these people\u0027s time and mine, just because you had nothing better to do!\" \"That\u0027s not true,\" he said, though he sounded uncertain. \"I do want a job... just not these jobs.\" \"You\u0027re in no position to pick and choose. You want out of Clarence\u0027s? These were your tickets. You should\u0027ve been able to get any of them if you\u0027d just put in a little effort. You\u0027re charming when you want to be. You could\u0027ve talked yourself into a job.\" I started the car. \"I\u0027m done with this.\" \"You don\u0027t understand,\" he said. \"I understand that you\u0027re going through a tough time. I understand that you\u0027re hurting.\" I refused to look at him and gave all my attention to the road. \"But that doesn\u0027t give you the right to play around with other people\u0027s lives. Try taking care of your own for a change.\" He made no response until we were back at Clarence\u0027s, and even then, I didn\u0027t want to hear it. \"Sage - \" he began. \"Get out,\" I said. He hesitated like he might disagree but finally conceded with a swift nod. He left the car and strode toward the house, lighting a cigarette as he went. Fury and frustration burned within me. How could one person continually send me on such emotional highs and lows? Whenever I was starting to like him and feel like we were actually connecting, he would go and do something like this. I was a fool to ever start letting myself feel friendly toward him. Had I really thought he was a work of art earlier? More like a piece of work. My feelings were still churning when I arrived back at Amberwood. I particularly cringed at the thought of running into Jill in our room. I had no doubt she\u0027d know everything that had happened with Adrian, and I had no desire to hear her defend him. But when I walked into my dorm, I never made it past the front desk. Mrs. Weathers was in the lobby, along with Eddie and a campus security officer. Micah hovered nearby, face pale. My heart stopped. Eddie sprinted toward me, panic written all over him. \"There you are! I couldn\u0027t get ahold of you or Keith.\" \"M-my phone was off.\" I looked over at Mrs. Weathers and the officer and saw the same worry on their faces as his. \"What\u0027s wrong?\" \"It\u0027s Jill,\" said Eddie grimly. \"She\u0027s missing.\"","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bloodlines-bloodlines-1/page-17.html","bookId":2041,"book":{"id":2041,"title":"Bloodlines (Bloodlines #1)","description":"Storyline: The first book in Richelle Mead\u0027s brand-new teen fiction series - set in the same world as Vampire Academy.
