I chose my lightest ensemble from the uniform selection: a gray skirt, paired with a short-sleeved white blouse. \"Simple jewelry\" was allowed, so I kept the gold cross on. My hair was having one of its difficult days - which seemed to be more often than not in this new climate. I wished I could pull it in a ponytail, like Jill did with hers, but it had too many layers to do that neatly. Eyeing where they hit my shoulders at different lengths, I wondered if maybe it was time to grow it out.\\n\\n After a breakfast neither of us really ate, we rode the shuttle bus up to Central Campus, which was suddenly packed with people. Only about a third of the students were boarders. The rest were locals, and they had all turned out today. Jill barely spoke throughout the entire ride and seemed to be sick again. It was hard to say, but I thought she looked paler than usual. Her eyes were bloodshot once more, heavy with dark circles. I\u0027d woken up once in the night and seen her fast asleep, so I wasn\u0027t entirely sure what the problem was. Those dark circles were actually the first flaw I\u0027d ever seen in any Moroi\u0027s skin - it was always perfect, porcelain. No wonder she could usually sleep in late. She didn\u0027t have to bother with the powder and concealer I used.\\n\\n As the morning progressed, Jill kept biting her lip and looking worriedly around. Maybe she was just nervous about immersing herself in a world populated entirely with humans. She didn\u0027t seem at all concerned about the logistics of getting to the right rooms and completing work. That was the aspect that still scared me a little. Just get from one class to another, I told myself. That\u0027s all you have to do.\\n\\n My first class was ancient history. Eddie was in it too, and he practically ran me down when he saw me. \"Is she okay? Have you seen her?\"\\n\\n \"Well, we share a room, so yeah.\" We sat down at neighboring desks. I smiled at Eddie. \"Relax. She\u0027s fine. She seemed nervous, but I can\u0027t really blame her.\"\\n\\n He nodded but still looked uncertain. He gave his full attention to the front of the room when the teacher stepped up, but there was a restlessness about Eddie as he sat there, like he could just barely stop himself from springing up to go check on Jill.\\n\\n \"Welcome, welcome.\" Our instructor was a forty-something woman with white-streaked, wiry black hair and enough nervous energy to rival Eddie - and if her giant coffee cup was any indication, it wasn\u0027t hard to figure out why. I was also a little jealous and wished we were allowed to have beverages in class - particularly since the dorm cafeteria didn\u0027t serve coffee. I didn\u0027t know how I was going to survive the next few months with caffeine-free days. Her wardrobe favored argyle. \"I am Ms. Terwilliger, your illustrious guide on the wondrous journey that is ancient history.\" She spoke in a sweeping, grandiose voice that made a few of my classmates break into snickers. She gestured to a young man who\u0027d been sitting behind her, near the large desk. He\u0027d been watching the class with a bored expression, but when she turned to him, he perked up. \"And this is my co-guide, Trey, whom I believe some of you may know. Trey is my student aide for this period, so he\u0027ll mostly be skulking in corners and filing papers. But you should be nice to him since he may very well be the one entering your grades into my computer.\"\\n\\n Trey gave a small wave and grinned at some of his friends. He had deeply tanned skin and black hair whose length flirted with the dress code\u0027s rules. The neatly pressed Amberwood uniform gave him the illusion of all business, but there was a mischievous glint in his dark eyes that made me think he didn\u0027t really take being an aide seriously.\\n\\n \"Now,\" continued Ms. Terwilliger. \"History is important because it teaches us about the past. And by learning about the past, you come to understand the present, so that you may make educated decisions about the future.\"\\n\\n She paused dramatically to let those words sink in. Once she was convinced we were awed, she moved over to a laptop that was wired up to a projector. She pushed a few keys, and an image of a white-pillared building appeared on the screen at the front of the room.\\n\\n \"Now, then. Can anyone tell me what this is?\"\\n\\n \"A temple?\" someone called out.\\n\\n \"Very good, Mr. - ?\"\\n\\n \"Robinson,\" the boy supplied.\\n\\n Ms. Terwilliger produced a clipboard and scanned a list. \"Ah, there you are. Robinson. Stephanie.\"\\n\\n \"Stephan,\" corrected the boy, flushing as some of his friends giggled.\\n\\n Ms. Terwilliger pushed her glasses up her nose and squinted. \"So you are. Thank goodness. I was just thinking how difficult your life must be with such a name. My apologies. I broke my glasses in a freak croquet accident this weekend, forcing me to bring my old ones today. So, Stephan-not-Stephanie, you\u0027re correct. It\u0027s a temple. Can you be more specific?\"\\n\\n Stephan shook his head.\\n\\n \"Can anyone else offer any insight?\"\\n\\n When only silence met Ms. Terwilliger, I took a deep breath and raised my hand. Time to see what it was like to be a real student. She nodded toward me.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s the Parthenon, ma\u0027am.\"\\n\\n \"Indeed it is,\" she said. \"And your name is?\"\\n\\n \"Sydney.\"\\n\\n \"Sydney...\" She checked the clipboard and looked up in astonishment. \"Sydney Melbourne? My goodness. You don\u0027t sound Australian.\"\\n\\n \"Er, it\u0027s Sydney Melrose, ma\u0027am,\" I corrected.\\n\\n Ms. Terwilliger scowled and handed the clipboard to Trey, who seemed to think my name was the funniest thing ever. \"You take over, Mr. Juarez. Your\\n\\n youthful eyes are better than mine. If I keep at this, I\u0027ll keep turning boys into girls and perfectly nice young ladies into the descendants of criminals. So.\" Ms. Terwilliger focused back on me. \"The Parthenon. Do you know anything about it?\"\\n\\n The others were watching me, mostly with friendly curiosity, but I still felt the pressure of being the center of attention. Focusing solely on Ms. Terwilliger, I said, \"It\u0027s part of the Acropolis, ma\u0027am. In Athens. It was built in the fifth century BC.\"\\n\\n \"No need to call me \u0027ma\u0027am,\u0027\" Ms. Terwilliger told me. \"Though it is refreshing to get a bit of respect for a change. And brilliantly answered.\" She glanced over the rest of the room. \"Now, tell me this. Why on earth should we care about Athens or anything that took place over fifteen hundred years ago? How can that be relevant to us today?\"\\n\\n More silence and shifting eyes. When the unbearable quiet dragged on for what felt like hours, I started to raise my hand again. Ms. Terwilliger didn\u0027t notice and glanced back at Trey, who was resting his feet on the teacher\u0027s desk. The boy instantly dropped his legs and straightened up.\\n\\n \"Mr. Juarez,\" declared Ms. Terwilliger. \"Time to earn your keep. You took this class last year. Can you tell them why the events of ancient Athens are relevant to us today? If you don\u0027t, then I\u0027m going to have to call on Miss Melbourne again. She looks like she knows the answer, and think how embarrassing that will be for you.\"\\n\\n Trey\u0027s eyes flicked to me and then back to the teacher. \"Her name is Melrose, not Melbourne. And democracy was founded in Athens in the sixth century. A lot of the procedures they set into place are still in effect with our government today.\"\\n\\n Ms. Terwilliger clasped her hand over her heart dramatically. \"You were paying attention last year! Well, almost. Your date is off.\" Her gaze fell on me. \"I bet you know the date democracy was started in Athens.\"\\n\\n \"The fifth century,\" I answered immediately.\\n\\n That earned me a smile from the teacher and a glare from Trey. The rest of the class proceeded in much the same way. Ms. Terwilliger continued on with her flamboyant style and highlighted a number of important times and places that we were going to study in more detail. I found I could answer any question she asked. Some part of me said I should ration myself, but I couldn\u0027t help it. If no one knew the answer, I felt compelled to provide it. And each time I did, Ms. Terwilliger would say, \"Trey, did you know that?\" I winced. I really didn\u0027t want to make enemies on my first day. The other students watched me curiously when I spoke, which made me a little self-conscious. I also saw a few of them exchange knowing looks each time I answered, as though they were in on some secret I wasn\u0027t. That concerned me more than irritating Trey did. Did it sound like I was showing off? I was too unsure of the social politics here to understand what was normal and what wasn\u0027t. This was an academically competitive school. Surely it wasn\u0027t a bad thing to be educated? Ms. Terwilliger left us with an assignment to read the first two chapters of our textbook. The others groaned, but I was excited. I loved history, specifically the history of art and architecture. My homeschooling had been aggressive and well rounded, but that particular subject wasn\u0027t one my father had thought we needed to spend a lot of time on. I\u0027d had to study it on my own time, and it was both startling and luxurious to think I now had a class whose sole purpose was to learn about this and that my knowledge would be valued - by the teacher, at least.\\n\\n I parted ways with Eddie after that and went off to AP Chemistry. While I was waiting for class to start, Trey slid into a desk beside me.\\n\\n \"So, Miss Melbourne,\" he said, imitating Ms. Terwilliger\u0027s voice. \"When will you be starting up your own history class?\"\\n\\n I was sorry Ms. Terwilliger had picked on him, but I didn\u0027t like his tone. \"Are you actually taking this class? Or are you going to lounge around some more and pretend to be helping the teacher?\"\\n\\n This brought a grin to his face. \"Oh, I\u0027m in this one, unfortunately. And I was Ms. T\u0027s best student last year. If you\u0027re as good at chemistry as you are in history, then I\u0027m nabbing you for a lab partner. I\u0027ll be able to take the whole semester off.\"\\n\\n Chemistry was a crucial part of the Alchemists\u0027 trade, and I doubted there was anything in this class I didn\u0027t already know. The Alchemists had arisen in the Middle Ages as \"magical scientists\" trying to turn lead into gold. From those early experiments, they\u0027d gone on to discover the special properties of vampire blood and how it reacted with other substances, eventually branching out into the crusade to keep vampires and humans separate from one another. That earlier scientific background, and our current work with vampire blood, made chemistry one of the main subjects of my childhood education. I\u0027d received my first chemistry set when I was six. When other kids were practicing the alphabet, my father was grilling me with acid and base flash cards. Unable to admit as much to Trey, I averted my eyes and casually brushed hair from my face. \"I\u0027m okay in it.\"\\n\\n His gaze moved to my cheek, and a look of understanding came over him. \"Ah. So that\u0027s it.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s it?\" I asked.\\n\\n He pointed to my face. \"Your tattoo. That\u0027s what it does, huh?\"\\n\\n In moving my hair, I\u0027d revealed the gold lily. \"What do you mean?\" I asked.\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t have to play coy with me,\" he said, rolling his dark eyes. \"I get it. I mean, it seems like cheating to me, but I guess not everyone cares about honor. Pretty ballsy to have it on your face, though. They\u0027re against the dress code, you know - not that that stops anyone.\"\\n\\n I shifted and let my hair fall back into place. \"I know. I meant to put makeup on it and forgot. But what do you mean about cheating?\"\\n\\n He simply shook his head in a way that clearly said I\u0027d been dismissed. I sat there feeling helpless, wondering what I\u0027d done wrong. Soon, my confusion was replaced by dismay as our instructor gave us an introduction to the class and its setup. I had a chemistry set back in my room that was more extensive than Amberwood\u0027s. Oh well. I supposed a little elementary review wouldn\u0027t hurt me.\\n\\n My other classes progressed in a similar way. I was on top of all my subjects and found myself answering every question. This got me in good with my teachers, but I couldn\u0027t gauge the rest of my classmates\u0027 reactions. I still saw a lot of rueful head shakes and intrigued expressions - but only Trey actually condemned. I didn\u0027t know if I should hold back or not.\\n\\n I ran into Kristin and Julia a couple of times, and they reminded me to join them for lunch. I did, finding them sitting in a corner table in East\u0027s cafeteria. They waved me over, and as I wove through the rows of tables, I did a quick scan, hoping to see Jill. I hadn\u0027t run into her all day, but that wasn\u0027t too shocking, considering our schedules. Presumably, she was eating over at the other cafeteria, maybe with Eddie or Micah.\\n\\n Kristin and Julia were friendly, chatting me up about how my first day had gone and imparting wisdom about certain teachers they\u0027d had before. They were seniors like me, and we shared a couple classes. We spent most of lunch exchanging basic info, like where we were all from. It wasn\u0027t until lunch was winding down that I began to get answers to some of the questions that had been bugging me all day. Although it required wading through still more questions first.\\n\\n \"So,\" said Kristin, leaning across the table. \"Does it just give you a super memory? Or does it like, I don\u0027t know, actually change your brain and make you smarter?\"\\n\\n Julia rolled her eyes. \"It can\u0027t make you smarter. It\u0027s gotta be memory. What I want to know is, how long does it last?\"\\n\\n I glanced back and forth between them, more confused than ever. \"Whatever you\u0027re talking about can\u0027t be making me smarter, because I\u0027m so lost right now.\"\\n\\n Kristin laughed at that. \"Your tattoo. I heard you answering all the hardest questions in math. And a friend of mine is in your history class and said you were dominating there too. We\u0027re trying to figure out how the tattoo helps you.\"\\n\\n \"Helps me... answer questions?\" I asked. Their faces confirmed as much. \"It doesn\u0027t. That stuff... that\u0027s just, well, me. I just know the answers.\"\\n\\n \"No one\u0027s that smart,\" argued Julia.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not that crazy. I\u0027m no genius. I guess I\u0027ve just learned a lot. I was homeschooled part of the time, and my dad was really... strict,\" I added, thinking that might help.\\n\\n \"Oh,\" said Kristin, toying with a long braid. I\u0027d noticed she wore her dark hair in very practical ways while blond Julia\u0027s was always teased and tousled. \"I guess that could be it... but then, what does your tattoo do?\"\\n\\n \"It doesn\u0027t do anything,\" I said. Yet even as I spoke the words, I felt a slight tingle in my flesh. The tattoo had a kind of magic in it that stopped me from speaking about anything Alchemist-related to those who weren\u0027t part of the inner circle. This was the tattoo stopping me from saying too much, not that there was any need. \"I just thought it was cool.\"\\n\\n \"Oh,\" said Julia. Both girls looked inexplicably disappointed.\\n\\n \"Why on earth would you think the tattoo is making me smart?\" I asked.\\n\\n The warning bell interrupted further conversation, reminding us all it was time to get to our next class. There was a pause as Kristin and Julia considered something. Kristin seemed to be the leader of the two because she was the one who gave a decisive nod. I had the distinct feeling I was being assessed.\\n\\n \"Okay,\" she said finally, giving me a big smile. \"We\u0027ll fill you in more on everything later.\"\\n\\n We set up a time to hang out and study later, then parted ways. My impression was that more socialization than studying would go on, which was fine with me, but I made a mental note to get my homework done first. The rest of the day went quickly, and I received a note in one class from Molly the advisor. As expected, I\u0027d passed out of all of my language courses, and she wanted me to come by and discuss matters during the last period, when I technically had no class. This meant that my school day would officially wrap up with PE.\\n\\n I changed into my assigned gym clothes, shorts and an Amberwood T-shirt, and trekked outside into the hot sun with the others. I\u0027d felt a little of the heat ducking between classes today, but it wasn\u0027t until I actually had to stand outside for any length of time that I really and truly appreciated the fact that we were out in the desert. Glancing around at my classmates, who were guys and girls of all grades, I saw that I wasn\u0027t the only one sweating. I rarely burned but reminded myself to pick up sunscreen to be safe. Jill would need it too.\\n\\n Jill!\\n\\n I peered around. I\u0027d nearly forgotten that Jill was supposed to be in the same class. Except, where was she? There was no sign of her. When our instructor, Miss Carson, called attendance, she didn\u0027t even say Jill\u0027s name. I wondered if there\u0027d been a last-minute schedule change.\\n\\n Miss Carson believed in jumping right into the action. We were divided into teams for volleyball, and I found myself standing beside Micah. His fair, freckled complexion was growing pink, and I almost wanted to suggest sunscreen to him as well. He gave me one of his friendly smiles.\\n\\n \"Hey,\" I said. \"You haven\u0027t seen my sister today, have you? Jill?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" he said. A slight frown crossed his forehead. \"Eddie was looking for her at lunch. He figured she was eating with you over at your dorm.\" I shook my head, a queasy feeling welling in my stomach. What was going on? Nightmare scenarios flashed through my mind. I\u0027d thought Eddie was overreacting with his vigilance, but had something happened to Jill? Was it possible that, despite all our planning, one of Jill\u0027s enemies had slipped in and stolen her out from under us? Was I going to have to tell the Alchemists - and my father - that we\u0027d lost Jill on the first day? Panic flashed through me. If I wasn\u0027t about to be sent to a re-education center before, I definitely was on my way to one now.\\n\\n \"Are you okay?\" Micah asked, studying me. \"Is Jill okay?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t know,\" I said. \"Excuse me.\" I broke out of my team formation and jogged over to where Miss Carson was supervising.\\n\\n \"Yes?\" she asked me.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m sorry to bother you, ma\u0027am, but I\u0027m worried about my sister. Jill Melrose. I\u0027m Sydney. She\u0027s supposed to be in here. Do you know if she changed classes?\"\\n\\n \"Ah, yes. Melrose. I got a note from the office, just before class, that she wouldn\u0027t be attending today.\"\\n\\n \"Did they say why?\"\\n\\n Miss Carson shook her head apologetically and barked an order to some guy who was slacking off. I rejoined my team, mind spinning. Well, at least someone had seen Jill today, but why on earth would she not be attending?\\n\\n \"Is she okay?\" Micah asked me.\\n\\n \"I... I guess. Miss Carson seemed to know she wouldn\u0027t be in class but doesn\u0027t know why.\"\\n\\n \"Is there anything I can do?\" he asked. \"To help her? Er, you guys?\"\\n\\n \"No, thanks. That\u0027s nice of you to ask.\" I wished there was a clock around. \"I\u0027ll check on her as soon as class is over.\" A thought suddenly occurred to me. \"But Micah? Don\u0027t say anything to Eddie.\"\\n\\n Micah gave me a curious look. \"Why not?\"\\n\\n \"He\u0027s overprotective. He\u0027ll worry when it\u0027s probably nothing.\"\\n\\n Also, he\u0027ll tear the school apart looking for her.\\n\\n When class ended, I quickly showered and changed clothes before heading to the administrative building. I was desperate to run back to the dorm first to see if Jill was there, but I couldn\u0027t be late for the appointment. As I walked down a hallway to Molly\u0027s office, I passed by the main one - and an idea came to me. I stopped in to talk to the attendance secretary before going to my appointment.\\n\\n \"Jill Melrose,\" the secretary said, nodding. \"She was sent back to her dorm.\"\\n\\n \"Sent back?\" I exclaimed. \"What does that mean?\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m not at liberty to say.\" Melodramatic much?\\n\\n Annoyed and more confused than ever, I went to Molly\u0027s office, taking comfort in the fact that even if Jill\u0027s absence was mysterious, at least it was sanctioned by the school. Molly told me I could either take another elective or engage in some kind of independent study in place of a language, if I got a teacher to sponsor me. An idea popped into my head.\\n\\n \"Can I check in with you tomorrow?\" I asked. \"I need to talk to someone first.\"\\n\\n \"Sure,\" said Molly. \"Just decide soon. You can go back to your dorm now, but we can\u0027t have you wandering around every day during this time.\" I assured her she\u0027d have an answer soon and headed back. The shuttle bus didn\u0027t run very often during classes, so I just walked the mile back. It only took fifteen minutes but felt twice as long in the heat. When I finally reached the dorm room, relief flooded me. Hanging out in our room as if nothing strange had happened was Jill.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re all right!\"\\n\\n Jill was lying on the bed, reading her book again. She looked up morosely. \"Yeah. Kind of.\"\\n\\n I sat down on my own bed and kicked off my shoes. \"What happened? I had a panic attack when you weren\u0027t in class. If Eddie knew - \"\\n\\n Jill sat bolt upright. \"No, don\u0027t tell Eddie. He\u0027ll freak out.\"\\n\\n \"Okay, okay. But tell me what happened. They said you got sent here?\"\\n\\n \"Yeah.\" Jill made a face. \"Because I was kicked out of my first class.\"\\n\\n I was speechless. I couldn\u0027t imagine what sweet, shy Jill could have possibly done to warrant that. Oh, God. I hope she didn\u0027t bite someone. I was the one everyone expected to have trouble fitting into a school schedule. Jill should have been a pro.\\n\\n \"What were you kicked out for?\"\\n\\n Jill sighed. \"For having a hangover.\"\\n\\n More speechlessness. \"What?\"\\n\\n \"I was sick. Ms. Chang - my teacher - took one look at me and said she could spot a hangover a mile away. She sent me to the office for breaking school rules. I told them I was just sick, but she kept saying she knew. The principal finally said there was no way to prove that\u0027s why I was sick, so I didn\u0027t get punished, but I wasn\u0027t allowed to go to the rest of my classes. I had to stay here for the rest of the school day.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s... that\u0027s idiotic!\" I shot to my feet and began pacing. Now that I\u0027d recovered from my initial disbelief, I was simply outraged. \"I was with you last night. You slept here. I should know. I woke up once, and you were out cold. How can Ms. Chang even make an accusation like that? She had no proof!\\n\\n The school didn\u0027t either. They had no right to send you out of class. I should go to the office right now! No, I\u0027m going to talk to Keith and the Alchemists and have our \u0027parents\u0027 file a complaint.\"\\n\\n \"No, wait, Sydney.\" Jill jumped up and caught ahold of my arm, as though afraid I would march out then and there. \"Please. Don\u0027t. Just let it go. I don\u0027t want to cause any more trouble. I didn\u0027t get any bad marks. I wasn\u0027t really punished.\"\\n\\n \"You\u0027re behind in your classes,\" I said. \"That\u0027s punishment enough.\"\\n\\n Jill shook her head, eyes wide. She was afraid, I realized, but I had no idea why she wouldn\u0027t want me to tell. She was the victim here. \"No, it\u0027s fine. I\u0027ll catch up. There are no long-term consequences. Please don\u0027t make a big deal out of this. The other teachers probably just thought I was sick. They probably don\u0027t even know about the accusations.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s not right, though,\" I growled. \"I can do something about it. It\u0027s what I\u0027m here for, to help you.\"\\n\\n \"No,\" said Jill adamantly. \"Please. Let it go. If you really want to help...\" She averted her eyes.\\n\\n \"What?\" I asked, still filled with righteous fury. \"What do you need? Name it.\"\\n\\n Jill looked back up. \"I need you... I need you to take me to Adrian.\" \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bloodlines-bloodlines-1/page-6.html","bookId":2041,"book":{"id":2041,"title":"Bloodlines (Bloodlines #1)","description":"Storyline: The first book in Richelle Mead\u0027s brand-new teen fiction series - set in the same world as Vampire Academy.
