{"id":109466,"no":9,"title":"Page 9","content":"CONSIDERING I WAS ONLY SUPPOSED to visit Clarence\u0027s twice a week for feedings, I was kind of amazed that I seemed to be here practically every day. Not only that, this was my first time visiting the estate alone. Before, I\u0027d been with Keith or Jill and had a very well-defined goal. Now, I was on my own. I hadn\u0027t realized how much that would freak me out until I was approaching the house, which became even more looming and dark than usual.\\n\\n There\u0027s nothing to be afraid of, I told myself. You\u0027ve been with a vampire and dhampir all week. You should be used to it. Besides, really, the scariest thing about this place was the old house itself. Clarence and Lee weren\u0027t all that intimidating, and Adrian... well, Adrian was pretty much the least scary vampire I\u0027d ever met. He was too bratty for me to feel any real fear, and actually... as much as I hated to admit it, I kind of looked forward to seeing him. It made no sense, but something about his infuriating nature made me forget about my other worries. Weirdly, I felt like I could relax around him.\\n\\n Dorothy escorted me in, and I expected to be taken to the sitting room again. Instead, the housekeeper led me through a few twists and turns of the dark halls, finally landing in a billiards room that looked like it could have been straight out of Clue. More dark wood lined the room, and stained glass windows let in filtered sunlight. Most of the room\u0027s illumination came from a hanging light centered over a rich green pool table. Adrian was lining up a shot as I shut the door behind me.\\n\\n \"Oh,\" he said, knocking a red ball into a hole. \"It\u0027s you.\"\\n\\n \"You were expecting someone else?\" I asked. \"Am I interrupting your social calendar?\" I made a big show of glancing around the empty room. \"I don\u0027t want to keep you from the mob of fans beating down your door.\"\\n\\n \"Hey, a guy can hope. I mean, it\u0027s not impossible that a car full of scantily clad sorority girls might break down outside and need my help.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s true,\" I said. \"Maybe I can put a sign out front that says, \u0027ATTENTION ALL GIRLS: FREE HELP HERE.\u0027\"\\n\\n \"\u0027ATTENTION ALL HOT GIRLS,\u0027\" he corrected, straightening up.\\n\\n \"Right,\" I said, trying not to roll my eyes. \"That\u0027s an important distinction.\"\\n\\n He pointed at me with the pool stick. \"Speaking of hot, I like that uniform.\"\\n\\n This time, I did roll my eyes. After Adrian had teased me last time about my uniform looking like my normal clothes, I\u0027d made sure to change out of it before coming today. Now I wore dark jeans and a black-and-white printed blouse with a ruffled collar. I should have known the outfit change wouldn\u0027t save me from his snark.\\n\\n \"Are you the only one here?\" I asked, noting his solo game.\\n\\n \"Nah. Clarence is around doing... I don\u0027t know. Old man stuff. And I think Lee\u0027s fixing that lock before he heads to LA. It\u0027s kind of funny. He seems upset that he needs to use tools. He keeps thinking the strength of his own hands should be more than enough.\"\\n\\n I couldn\u0027t help a smile. \"I don\u0027t suppose you offered to help?\"\\n\\n \"Sage,\" Adrian declared. \"These hands don\u0027t do manual labor.\" He knocked another ball into a hole. \"You want to play?\"\\n\\n \"What? With you?\"\\n\\n \"No, with Clarence.\" He sighed at my dumbfounded look. \"Yes, of course with me.\"\\n\\n \"No. I need to talk to you about Jill.\"\\n\\n He was silent for a few moments and then returned to the game as though nothing had happened. \"She wasn\u0027t sick today.\" He said that with certainty, though there was a funny, bitter tone to his words.\\n\\n \"No. Well, not in the same way. She got sick out in the sun during PE. I\u0027m going to see Keith after this to see if we can get a medical excuse.\" I\u0027d actually tried calling him earlier, with no luck. \"But that\u0027s not why I\u0027m here. There\u0027s a guy who likes Jill - a human guy.\"\\n\\n \"Have Castile rough him up.\"\\n\\n I leaned back against the wall and sighed. \"That\u0027s the thing. I asked him to. Well, not rough him up, exactly. It\u0027s Eddie\u0027s roommate. I asked Eddie to tell him to back off and make up some reason for staying away from Jill - like that she\u0027s too young.\" Fearing Adrian would be as lax as Eddie in this, I asked, \"You understand why it\u0027s important, right? No Moroi and human dating?\"\\n\\n He was watching the table, not me. \"Yup, I\u0027m with you there, Sage. But I still don\u0027t see the problem.\"\\n\\n \"Eddie won\u0027t do it. He says he doesn\u0027t think Jill should be denied the chance to date and go to dances. That it\u0027s okay if she and Micah hang out, so long as it doesn\u0027t get serious.\"\\n\\n Adrian was good at hiding his feelings, but this looked like it\u0027d caught him by surprise. He straightened up and spun the base of the pool stick on the floor as he thought. \"That is weird. I mean, I get the logic, and there\u0027s something to it. She shouldn\u0027t be forced into isolation while she\u0027s here. I\u0027m just surprised Castile came up with it.\"\\n\\n \"Yeah, but that\u0027s a hard concept to live by. Where do you draw the \u0027casual\u0027 line? Honestly, I get this feeling Eddie just didn\u0027t want to confront Micah - the roommate. Which is crazy, because Eddie doesn\u0027t seem like the type to be afraid of anything. What is there about Micah that would make Eddie so uneasy?\"\\n\\n \"Is Micah some big, hulking guy?\"\\n\\n \"No,\" I said. \"He\u0027s built, I guess. Good at sports. Really friendly and easygoing - not the type you\u0027d have to be afraid would turn on you if you warned him away from your sister.\"\\n\\n \"Then you can talk to him. Or just talk to Jailbait and explain things to her.\" Adrian seemed satisfied he\u0027d solved the matter and knocked in the last ball. \"That was my plan. I just wanted to make sure you\u0027d back me. Jill listens to you, and I thought it\u0027d be easier if she knew you agreed with me. Not that I even know how she feels. For all I know, this is all overkill.\"\\n\\n \"Can\u0027t hurt to be too careful with her,\" said Adrian. He stared off, lost in his own thoughts. \"And I\u0027ll let her know how I feel about it.\"\\n\\n \"Thank you,\" I said, kind of surprised at how easy this had been.\\n\\n His green eyes danced mischievously. \"Now will you play a round with me?\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t really - \"\\n\\n The door opened, and Lee walked in, dressed casually in jeans and a T-shirt. He was carrying a screwdriver. \"Hey, Sydney. I thought I saw your car out there.\" He glanced around. \"Is, uh, Jill with you?\"\\n\\n \"Not today,\" I said. New insight struck me as I recalled that Lee attended school in Los Angeles. \"Lee, have you ever dated a human girl at your school?\"\\n\\n Adrian arched an eyebrow. \"Are you asking him out, Sage?\"\\n\\n I scowled. \"No!\"\\n\\n Lee turned thoughtful. \"No, not really. I have some human friends, and we go out as a group and hang out... but I\u0027ve never done more than that. LA\u0027s a big place, though. There are Moroi girls around, if you know where to look.\"\\n\\n Adrian perked up. \"Oh?\"\\n\\n My hope that Lee might tell Jill he too had to avoid dating faded. \"Well, that would make your dating situation much easier than Jill\u0027s.\"\\n\\n \"What do you mean?\" asked Lee.\\n\\n I recapped everything to him about Micah and Eddie. Lee nodded along thoughtfully.\\n\\n \"That is hard,\" he admitted.\\n\\n \"Can we go back to the part about Moroi girls hanging out in LA?\" asked Adrian hopefully. \"Can you direct me to some of the... oh, let\u0027s say, more open-minded ones?\"\\n\\n Lee\u0027s attention was on me, however. His easy smile grew uncertain, and he glanced at his feet. \"This might seem kind of weird... but I mean, I wouldn\u0027t mind asking Jill out.\"\\n\\n Adrian was on that before I could even think of a response. \"What, do you mean like on a date? You son of a bitch! She\u0027s only fifteen.\" You never would\u0027ve guessed he\u0027d been talking about easy Moroi girls only moments before.\\n\\n \"Adrian,\" I said. \"I\u0027m guessing Lee\u0027s definition of a date is a little different than yours.\"\\n\\n \"Sorry, Sage. You\u0027ve got to trust me when it comes to dating definitions. Last I checked, you aren\u0027t an expert in social matters. I mean, when was the last time you were even on a date?\" It was just another of the witty barbs he tossed around so easily, but it stung a little. Was my lack of social experience that obvious?\\n\\n \"But,\" I added, ignoring Adrian\u0027s question, \"there is an age difference.\" I honestly had no idea how old Lee was. His being in college gave me some clue, but Clarence seemed awfully old. Having a child late in life wasn\u0027t that weird, though, for humans or Moroi.\\n\\n \"There is,\" said Lee. \"I\u0027m nineteen. Not a huge gap - but big enough. I shouldn\u0027t have said anything.\" He looked embarrassed, and I felt both sorry for him and confused for myself. Matchmaking wasn\u0027t in the Alchemist handbook.\\n\\n \"Why would you want to ask her out?\" I asked. \"I mean, she\u0027s great. But are you just doing this to distract her from Micah and give her a safe dating alternative? Or do you, um, like her?\"\\n\\n \"Of course he likes her,\" said Adrian, quick to defend Jill\u0027s honor.\\n\\n I had a feeling that there was really no good way for Lee to answer at this point. If he expressed interest in her, Adrian\u0027s bizarre chivalric instincts were going to kick in. If Lee wasn\u0027t interested, Adrian would no doubt demand to know why Lee didn\u0027t want to marry her then and there. It was one of those fascinating - but weird - quirks of Adrian\u0027s personality.\\n\\n \"I like her,\" said Lee bluntly. \"I\u0027ve only talked to her a couple of times, but... well, I\u0027d really like to get to know her better.\"\\n\\n Adrian scoffed, and I shot him a glare. \"Once again,\" I said. \"I think you guys have different definitions for the same words.\"\\n\\n \"Not true,\" said Adrian. \"All guys mean the same thing when they want to \u0027get to know a girl better.\u0027 You\u0027re a well-bred young lady, so I understand why you\u0027d be too innocent to understand. Good thing you\u0027ve got me here to interpret.\"\\n\\n I turned back to Lee, not even bothering to respond to Adrian. \"I think it\u0027s fine if you go out with her.\"\\n\\n \"Assuming she\u0027d even be interested,\" said Lee, looking uncertain.\\n\\n I remembered her smile when he\u0027d stopped to talk to her yesterday. That had seemed pretty promising. But then, so had her enthusiasm over Micah. \"I bet she would.\"\\n\\n \"So you\u0027re just going to let her go off alone?\" asked Adrian, giving me a look that told me not to question him. This time, his concern was legitimate. I shared it. Jill was in Palm Springs to be safe. She was enrolled at Amberwood because it was also safe. Suddenly going out with a guy we hardly knew would not meet either Alchemist or guardian protocols for safety.\\n\\n \"Well, she can\u0027t even leave campus,\" I said, thinking aloud. \"Not without me.\"\\n\\n \"Whoa,\" said Adrian, \"if you get to come along as a chaperone, so do I.\"\\n\\n \"If we both do, then Eddie will want to as well,\" I pointed out. \"Doesn\u0027t sound like much of a date.\"\\n\\n \"So?\" Adrian\u0027s brief moment of seriousness and concern had vanished in the face of what he saw as social fun. How could anyone\u0027s mood flip so quickly? \"Think of it as less of a date than a faux-family outing. One that will entertain me while protecting her virtue.\"\\n\\n I put my hands on my hips and turned toward him. This seemed to amuse him more. \"Adrian, we\u0027re focusing on Jill here. This isn\u0027t about your personal entertainment.\"\\n\\n \"Not true,\" he said, green eyes sparkling. \"Everything\u0027s about my personal entertainment. The world is my stage. Keep it up - you\u0027re becoming a star performer in the show.\"\\n\\n Lee glanced between us with a comically helpless look. \"Do you guys want to be alone?\"\\n\\n I flushed. \"Sorry.\" Adrian made no apologies, of course.\\n\\n \"Look,\" said Lee, who kind of seemed like he was beginning to regret bringing this up at all. \"I like her. If it means bringing your whole group so I can be with her, then that\u0027s fine.\"\\n\\n \"Maybe it\u0027s better this way,\" I mused. \"Maybe if we do more things as a group - aside from her feedings - she won\u0027t be in danger of wanting to go out with a human guy.\" Who we didn\u0027t even know for sure that she was interested in. We didn\u0027t even know if she was interested in Lee either. We were being awfully heavy-handed with her love life, I realized.\\n\\n \"This is kind of what I wanted before,\" Adrian said to me. \"Just more of a social life.\"\\n\\n I thought back to yesterday\u0027s conversation, in which he\u0027d demanded I find him lodging. \"That\u0027s not quite what you asked for.\"\\n\\n \"If you want to get out more,\" said Lee, \"you should come back to LA with me tonight. I\u0027ll be back here after class tomorrow anyway, so it\u0027d just be a quick trip.\"\\n\\n Adrian brightened so much that I wondered if Lee had suggested it to try to smooth over any tension remaining about his interest in Jill. \"Will you introduce me to those girls?\" asked Adrian.\\n\\n \"Unbelievable,\" I said. Adrian\u0027s double standard was ridiculous.\\n\\n I didn\u0027t notice the door opening until Keith was completely in the room. I was never exactly happy to see him, but it was good luck that he was suddenly here, right when I needed to talk to him about Jill and her problems with PE. My best plan had been to show up at his apartment and hope to catch him there. He\u0027d saved me the trouble.\\n\\n Keith looked at all three of us - but he didn\u0027t share our smiles. No winks or pretty boy charm from him today. \"I saw your car out there, Sydney,\" he said sternly, turning to me. \"What are you doing here?\"\\n\\n \"I had to talk to Adrian,\" I said. \"Did you get my message? I tried calling earlier.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027ve been busy,\" he said crisply. His expression was hard, his tone chilling the room. Adrian and Lee had lost their smiles, and both now looked confused as they tried to figure out why Keith was so annoyed. I shared their curiosity. \"Let\u0027s talk. In private.\"\\n\\n I suddenly felt like a naughty child without knowing why. \"Sure,\" I said. \"I... I was just leaving anyway.\" I moved to join Keith at the door.\\n\\n \"Wait,\" said Lee. \"What about - \" Adrian nudged him and shook his head, murmuring something I couldn\u0027t hear. Lee stayed quiet.\\n\\n \"See you around,\" said Adrian cheerfully. \"Don\u0027t worry - I\u0027ll remember what we talked about.\"\\n\\n \"Thanks,\" I said. \"See you guys later.\"\\n\\n Keith left without a word, and I followed him out of the house and into the late-afternoon heat. The temperature had gone down since the ill-fated PE class but not by much. Keith trudged through the gravel driveway, coming to a halt beside Latte. His car was parked nearby.\\n\\n \"That was rude,\" I told him. \"You didn\u0027t even say goodbye to them.\"\\n\\n \"Sorry if I don\u0027t bring out my best manners for vampires,\" snapped Keith. \"I\u0027m not as close to them as you are.\"\\n\\n \"What\u0027s that supposed to mean?\" I demanded, crossing my arms. Staring him down, I felt all my old animosity bubble up. It was hard to believe that I\u0027d been laughing just a minute ago.\\n\\n Keith sneered. \"Just that you seemed awfully cozy with them in there - hanging out, having a good time. I didn\u0027t know this was where you spent your free time after school.\"\\n\\n \"How dare you! I came here on business,\" I growled.\\n\\n \"Yeah, I could tell.\"\\n\\n \"I did. I had to talk to Adrian about Jill.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t recall him being her guardian.\"\\n\\n \"He cares about her,\" I argued. \"Just like any of us would for a friend.\"\\n\\n \"Friend? They\u0027re not like us at all,\" said Keith. \"They\u0027re godless and unnatural, and you have no business being friends with any of them.\"\\n\\n I wanted to shout back that from what I\u0027d observed, Lee was a hundred times more decent of a person than Keith would ever be. Even Adrian was. It was only at the last second that my training kicked in. Don\u0027t raise a fuss. Don\u0027t contradict your superiors. No matter how much I hated it, Keith was in charge here. I took a deep breath.\\n\\n \"It was hardly fraternizing. I simply came by to talk to Adrian, and Lee happened to be here. It wasn\u0027t like we\u0027d all been planning some big party.\" Best not to mention the group date plan.\\n\\n \"Why didn\u0027t you just call Adrian if you had a question? You called me.\"\\n\\n Because being face-to-face with him is less sickening than being around you.\\n\\n \"It was important. And when I couldn\u0027t get ahold of you, I figured I\u0027d have to drive over to your place anyway.\"\\n\\n Hoping to shift away from my \"bad behavior,\" I jumped in and recapped everything that had happened today, including Jill\u0027s sun exposure and Micah\u0027s attentions.\\n\\n \"Of course she can\u0027t date him,\" he exclaimed, after I\u0027d explained about Micah. \"You have to put a stop to that.\"\\n\\n \"I\u0027m trying. And Adrian and Lee said they\u0027d help.\"\\n\\n \"Oh, well, I feel a lot better now.\" Keith shook his head. \"Don\u0027t be naive, Sydney. I told you. They don\u0027t care about this stuff as much as we do.\"\\n\\n \"I think they do,\" I argued. \"Adrian seemed to get it, and he has a lot of influence over Jill.\"\\n\\n \"Well, he\u0027s not the one the Alchemists are going to come after and send off to re-education for playing around with vampires when she should be disciplining them.\"\\n\\n I could only stare. I wasn\u0027t sure which part of what he\u0027d just said was more offensive: the well-worn insinuation that I was a \"vamp lover\" or that I was capable of \"disciplining\" any of them. I should\u0027ve known his false friendliness wouldn\u0027t last.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m doing my job here,\" I said, still keeping my voice level. \"And from what I can see, I\u0027m doing more work than you, since I\u0027m the one who\u0027s been putting out fires all week.\"\\n\\n I knew it was an illusion, seeing as the glass eye couldn\u0027t really stare, but I felt like he was glaring at me with both eyes. \"I\u0027m doing plenty. Don\u0027t even think to criticize me.\"\\n\\n \"What were you doing here?\" I asked, suddenly realizing how weird that was. He\u0027d accused me of \"socializing\" but had never explained his motives. \"I had to see Clarence, not that it\u0027s any of your business.\"\\n\\n I wanted more details but refused to let on how curious I was. He\u0027d been here yesterday too, according to Lee. \"Will you call the school tomorrow and get Jill excused from PE?\"\\n\\n Keith gave me a long and heavy look. \"No.\"\\n\\n \"What? Why not?\"\\n\\n \"Because being out in the sun won\u0027t kill her.\"\\n\\n Again, I bit down on my anger and tried for the diplomacy I\u0027d been schooled in. \"Keith, you didn\u0027t see her. Maybe it won\u0027t kill her, but it was miserable for her. She was in agony.\"\\n\\n \"I don\u0027t really care if they\u0027re miserable or not,\" Keith said. \"And neither should you. Our job is to keep her alive. There was no mention of making sure she\u0027s happy and comfortable.\"\\n\\n \"I wouldn\u0027t think anyone would have to tell us,\" I said, aghast. Why was he so upset? \"I\u0027d think being sensitive human beings, we could just do it.\" \"Well, now you can. You can either get someone above us to issue a note to the school or you can give her ice baths after gym class. I really don\u0027t care what you do, but maybe it\u0027ll keep you busy enough that you\u0027ll stop coming over here unannounced and throwing yourself at creatures of darkness. Don\u0027t let me hear about this happening again.\"\\n\\n \"You are unbelievable,\" I said. I was too upset and at a loss for words to manage anything more eloquent.\\n\\n \"I\u0027m looking out for your soul,\" he said loftily. \"It\u0027s the least I can do for your dad. Too bad you aren\u0027t more like your sisters.\"\\n\\n Keith turned his back on me and unlocked the car door without another word. He got in and drove off, leaving me staring. Tears threatened my eyes, and I swallowed them back. I felt like an idiot - but not because of his accusations. I didn\u0027t believe for an instant that I\u0027d done anything wrong by coming over here. No, I was mad - mad at myself - because I\u0027d let him walk away with the last word and because I hadn\u0027t had the nerve to say anything back. I\u0027d stayed silent, just like everyone always told me to.\\n\\n I kicked the gravel in my anger, sending a spray of it into the air. A few small rocks hit my car, and I winced. \"Sorry.\"\\n\\n \"Would he accuse you of being evil for talking to an inanimate object?\"\\n\\n I spun around, heart racing. Adrian was leaning against the house, smoking. \"Where did you come from?\" I demanded. Even though I knew everything there was to know about vampires, it was hard to shake superstitious fears of them appearing out of thin air.\\n\\n \"Other door,\" he explained. \"I went out to smoke and overheard the commotion.\"\\n\\n \"It\u0027s rude to eavesdrop,\" I said, knowing I sounded unbearably prim but unable to stop myself.\\n\\n \"It\u0027s rude to be an asshole like that.\" Adrian nodded toward where Keith had driven away. \"Are you going to be able to get Jill out of class?\" I sighed, suddenly feeling tired. \"Yeah, I should be able to. It\u0027ll just take a little longer while I get some other Alchemist to be our fake parents. Would\u0027ve been a lot faster if Keith had done it.\"\\n\\n \"Thanks for looking out for her, Sage. You\u0027re okay. For a human.\"\\n\\n I almost laughed. \"Thanks.\"\\n\\n \"You can say it too, you know.\"\\n\\n I walked over to Latte and paused. \"Say what?\"\\n\\n \"That I\u0027m okay... for a vampire,\" he explained.\\n\\n I shook my head, still smiling. \"You\u0027ll have a hard time getting any Alchemist to admit that. But I can say you\u0027re okay for an irreverent party boy with occasional moments of brilliance.\"\\n\\n \"Brilliant? You think I\u0027m brilliant?\" He threw his hands skyward. \"You hear that, world? Sage says I\u0027m brilliant.\"\\n\\n \"That\u0027s not what I said!\"\\n\\n He dropped the cigarette and stamped it out, giving me a devil-may-care grin. \"Thanks for the ego boost. I\u0027m going to go tell Clarence and Lee all about your high opinion.\"\\n\\n \"Hey, I didn\u0027t - \"\\n\\n But he was already gone. As I drove away, I decided the Alchemists needed an entire department devoted to handling Adrian Ivashkov. When I got back to my dorm room, I found Jill sitting surrounded in textbooks and papers, undoubtedly trying to catch up from yesterday. \"Wow,\" I said, thinking of the homework that waited for me too. \"You\u0027ve got a whole command center set up.\"\\n\\n Rather than smile at my joke, Jill looked up with an icy gaze. \"Do you think,\" she said, \"that maybe next time you want to mess with my dating life, you could talk to me first?\"\\n\\n I was speechless. Adrian had said he\u0027d talk to Jill. I just hadn\u0027t realized it\u0027d be so quickly.\\n\\n \"You don\u0027t have to go behind my back to keep me away from Micah,\" she added. \"I\u0027m not stupid. I know I can\u0027t date a human.\"\\n\\n So Adrian had apparently told her that much.\\n\\n \"And,\" Jill continued, still in that cold tone, \"you don\u0027t have to set me up with the only eligible Moroi within a hundred miles in order to keep me out of trouble.\"\\n\\n Okay... Adrian had apparently told her everything. I would\u0027ve expected more discretion from him, especially with the Lee part.\\n\\n \"We... we weren\u0027t setting you up,\" I said lamely. \"Lee wanted to ask you out anyway.\"\\n\\n \"But rather than talk to me, he asked permission from you guys! You don\u0027t control my life.\"\\n\\n \"I know that,\" I said. \"We weren\u0027t trying to!\" How had this just blown up right in front of me? \"Lee acted on his own.\"\\n\\n \"Just like you did when you went to talk to Adrian behind my back.\" Her eyes glittered with angry tears, daring me to deny it. I couldn\u0027t and only now realized the wrongness of what I\u0027d done. Ever since she found out she was royal, Jill had watched other people dictate her life for her. Maybe my intentions to get Adrian to talk to her about Micah were good, but I\u0027d addressed them in the wrong way.\\n\\n \"You\u0027re right,\" I said. \"I\u0027m sorry that I - \"\\n\\n \"Forget it,\" she said, slipping a pair of headphones on. \"I don\u0027t want to hear any more. You made me look stupid in front of both Adrian and Lee. Not that they\u0027ll even think twice about me in Los Angeles tonight.\" She waved a hand at me and looked down at the book in front of her. \"I\u0027m done with you.\"\\n\\n Whether she couldn\u0027t hear me because of the music or simply because she\u0027d now chosen to ignore me, I couldn\u0027t say. All I knew was that I once again found myself comparing her to Zoe. Just like with Zoe, I\u0027d tried to do something good for Jill, and it had backfired. Just like with Zoe, I\u0027d ended up hurting and humiliating the one I\u0027d tried to protect.\\n\\n Sorry, Sage. Last I checked, you aren\u0027t an expert in social matters.\\n\\n That, I thought bitterly, was the saddest part of all - that Adrian Ivashkov was right. \\n\\n","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bloodlines-bloodlines-1/page-9.html","bookId":2041,"book":{"id":2041,"title":"Bloodlines (Bloodlines #1)","description":"Storyline: The first book in Richelle Mead\u0027s brand-new teen fiction series - set in the same world as Vampire Academy. When alchemist Sydney is ordered into hiding to protect the life of Moroi princess Jill Dragomir, the last place she expects to be sent is a human private school in Palm Springs, California. But at their new school, the drama is only just beginning.
