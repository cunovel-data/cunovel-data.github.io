{"id":109483,"no":27,"title":"Page 27","content":"I THINK ADRIAN would have agreed to anything to get his own place. He didn\u0027t waste any time in moving his few possessions over to Keith\u0027s old apartment, much to Clarence\u0027s dismay. I had to admit, I felt kind of bad for the old man. He\u0027d grown fond of Adrian, and losing him right after Lee was especially tough. Clarence still opened his home and feeder to our group but refused to believe anything we told him about Lee and Strigoi. Even once he accepted Lee was dead, Clarence continued blaming vampire hunters. Shortly after his move, I went to check on Adrian. Word had come to us that the \"research party\" from the Moroi was due to arrive in town that day, and we\u0027d decided to meet with them first before bringing in Jill and Eddie. Like before, Abe was apparently escorting the newcomers, who included Sonya and Jill\u0027s new roommate. I had the impression there might be others with them but hadn\u0027t heard the details yet. \"Whoa,\" I said when Adrian let me into his apartment. He\u0027d only been there a couple days, but the transformation was startling. With the exception of the TV, none of the original furniture remained. It was all different, and even the apartment\u0027s layout had changed. The decorating scheme was new as well, and the scent of fresh paint hung heavy in the air. \"Yellow, huh?\" I asked, staring at the living room walls. \"It\u0027s called \u0027Goldenrod,\u0027\" he corrected. \"And it\u0027s supposed to be cheerful and calming.\" I started to point out that those two traits didn\u0027t seem like they\u0027d go together but then decided against it. The color, slightly obnoxious though it was, completely transformed the living room. Between that and the blinds that had replaced Keith\u0027s heavy drapes, the room was now filled with color and light that went a long way to obscure the memory of the battle. I shuddered, recalling it. Even if the apartment hadn\u0027t been needed to buy Adrian\u0027s help, I wasn\u0027t sure I could\u0027ve accepted it and stayed here. The memory of Lee\u0027s death - and the two Strigoi women\u0027s - was too strong. \"How did you afford new furniture?\" I asked. The Alchemists had given him the place, but there was no other stipend involved. \"I sold the old stuff,\" Adrian said, seeming very pleased by this. \"That recliner...\" He faltered, a troubled look briefly crossing his features. I wondered if he too could imagine Lee\u0027s life bleeding away in that chair. \"That recliner was worth a lot. It was appallingly overpriced, even by my standards. But I got enough for it to replace the rest. It\u0027s used, but what choice did I have?\" \"It\u0027s nice,\" I said, running my hand along an overstuffed plaid sofa. It looked ghastly with the walls but appeared to be in good shape. Plus, much like the brightness of the yellow, the clashing furniture helped diminish the memories of what had happened. \"You must have done some savvy shopping. I\u0027m guessing you don\u0027t buy a lot of used stuff.\" \"Try never,\" he said. \"You have no idea the things I\u0027ve had to lower myself to.\" His pleased smile dimmed as he regarded me carefully. \"How are you holding up?\" I shrugged. \"Fine. Why wouldn\u0027t I be? What happened to me isn\u0027t nearly as bad as what Jill went through.\" He crossed his arms. \"I don\u0027t know. Jill didn\u0027t watch a guy die in front of her. And let\u0027s not forget that same guy wanted to kill you only moments before in order to rise again from the dead.\" Those were things that had definitely been on my mind a lot in the last week, things that were going to take a while to get over. Sometimes, I didn\u0027t feel anything at all. Other times, the reality of what had happened descended on me so swiftly and heavily that I couldn\u0027t breathe. Strigoi nightmares had replaced the ones of re-education centers. \"I\u0027m actually better with it than you might think,\" I said slowly, gazing off at nothing particular. \"Like, it\u0027s terrible about Lee and what he did, but I feel I can get over it in time. Do you know what I keep thinking about the most, though?\" \"What?\" asked Adrian gently. The words seemed to come forth without my control. I hadn\u0027t expected to say them to anyone, certainly not to him. \"Lee telling me I was wasting my life and staying aloof from people. And then, during that last meeting with Keith, he told me that I was naive, that I didn\u0027t understand the world. And it\u0027s true to a certain extent. I mean, not what he said about you guys being evil... but well, I was naive. I should\u0027ve been more careful with Jill. I believed the best of Lee when I should\u0027ve been more wary. I\u0027m not a fighter like Eddie, but I am an observer of the world... or so I like to think. But I failed. I\u0027m no good with people.\" \"Sage, your first mistake in all of this is listening to anything Keith Darnell says. The guy\u0027s an idiot, an asshole, and a dozen other words that aren\u0027t suitable for a lady like yourself.\" \"See?\" I said. \"You just admitted it, that I\u0027m some kind of untouchable, pure soul.\" \"I never said any such thing,\" he countered. \"My point is that you\u0027re leagues above Keith, and what happened with Lee was dumb, ridiculous bad luck. And remember, none of us saw it coming either. You weren\u0027t alone. It casts no reflection on you. Or...\" His eyebrows rose. \"Maybe it does. Didn\u0027t you say that Lee considered killing Keith for Alchemist blood?\" \"Yeah... but Keith left too soon.\" \"Well, there you go. Even a psychopath recognized your worth enough to want to kill someone else first.\" I didn\u0027t know whether to laugh or cry. \"That doesn\u0027t make me feel better.\" Adrian shrugged. \"My earlier point remains. You\u0027re a solid person, Sage. You\u0027re easy on the eyes, if a little skinny, and your ability to memorize useless information is going to totally hook in some guy. Put Keith and Lee out of your head because they have nothing to do with your future.\" \"Skinny?\" I asked, hoping I wasn\u0027t blushing. I also hoped if I sounded outraged enough, he wouldn\u0027t notice how much the other comment had disarmed me. Easy on the eyes. Not exactly the same as being told I was hotness incarnate or drop-dead gorgeous. But after a lifetime of having my appearance judged as \"acceptable,\" it was a heady compliment - especially coming from him. \"I just tell it like it is.\" I almost laughed. \"Yes. Yes, you do. Now tell me about a different subject, please. I\u0027m tired of this one.\" \"Sure thing.\" Adrian infuriated me sometimes, but I had to admit, I loved his short attention span. It made dodging uncomfortable topics so much easier. Or so I thought. \"Do you smell that?\" An image of the bodies flashed into my head, and for a moment, all I could think he meant was the smell of decay. Then I sniffed more deeply. \"I smell the paint, and... wait... is that pine?\" He looked impressed. \"Damn straight. Pine-scented cleaner. As in, I cleaned.\" He gestured to the kitchen dramatically. \"With these hands, these hands that don\u0027t do manual labor.\" I stared off into the kitchen. \"What did you use it on? The cupboards?\" \"The cupboards are fine. I cleaned the floor and the counter.\" I must have looked more puzzled than amazed because he added, \"I even got down on my knees.\" \"You used pine cleaner on the floor and counters?\" I asked. The floor was ceramic tile; the counters were granite. Adrian frowned. \"Yeah, so?\" He seemed so proud to have actually scrubbed something for once in his life that I couldn\u0027t bring myself to tell him pine cleaner was generally only used on wood. I gave him an encouraging smile. \"Well, it looks great. I need you to come over and clean my new dorm room now. It\u0027s covered in dust.\" \"No way, Sage. My own housecleaning\u0027s bad enough.\" \"But is it worth it? If you\u0027d stayed at Clarence\u0027s, you had a live-in cook and cleaner.\" \"It\u0027s definitely worth it. I\u0027ve never really, truly had my own place. I kind of did at Court... but it might as well have been an over-glorified dorm room. This? This is great. Even with the housecleaning. Thank you.\" The comic look of horror he\u0027d worn while discussing housecleaning had been traded away for utter seriousness now as those green eyes weighed me. I suddenly felt uncomfortable under the scrutiny and was reminded of the spirit dream, where I\u0027d questioned if his eyes really were that green in real life. \"For what?\" I asked. \"For this - I know you must have twisted some Alchemist arms.\" I hadn\u0027t told him that I\u0027d actually passed on taking the place for myself. \"And for everything else. For not giving up on me, even when I was being a major asshole. And, you know, for that saving my life thing.\" I looked away. \"I didn\u0027t do anything. That was Eddie - and Jill. They\u0027re the ones who saved you.\" \"Not sure I would\u0027ve been alive for their rescue if you hadn\u0027t set that bitch on fire. How did you do that?\" \"It was nothing,\" I protested. \"Just a, uh, chemical reaction from the Alchemist bag of tricks.\" Those eyes studied me again, weighing the truth of my words. I\u0027m not sure he believed me, but he let it go. \"Well, from the look on her face, your aim was right on. And then you got backhanded for it. Anyone who takes a hit for Adrian Ivashkov deserves some credit.\" I turned my back to him, still shy with the praise - and nervous about the fire reference - and walked over to the window. \"Yeah, well, you can rest easy that it was a selfish act. You have no idea what a pain it is to file paperwork for a dead Moroi.\" He laughed, and it was one of the few times I\u0027d heard him laugh with genuine humor and warmth - and not because of something twisted or sarcastic. \"Okay, Sage. If you say so. You know, you\u0027re a lot spunkier than when I first met you.\" \"Really? All the adjectives in the world at your disposable, and you pick \u0027spunky\u0027?\" Banter I could handle. So long as I focused on that, I didn\u0027t have to think about the meaning behind the words or how my heartbeat had increased just a little. \"Just so you know, you\u0027re a little more stable than when I met you.\" He came over to stand by me. \"Well, don\u0027t tell anyone, but I think getting away from Court was a good thing. This weather sucks, but Palm Springs might be good for me - it and all the wonders it contains. You guys. Art classes. Pine cleaner.\" I couldn\u0027t help a grin and looked up at him. I\u0027d been half-joking, but it was true: he had changed remarkably since we\u0027d met. There was still a hurting man inside, one who bore the scars of what Rose and Dimitri had done to him, but I could see the signs of healing. He was steadier and stronger, and if he could just continue to hold the course, with no more crises for a while, a remarkable transformation might truly happen. It took several seconds of silence for me to realize that I\u0027d been staring at him while my mind spun out its thoughts. And, actually, he was staring at me, with a look of wonder. \"My God, Sage. Your eyes. How have I never noticed them?\" That uncomfortable feeling was spreading over me again. \"What about them?\" \"The color,\" he breathed. \"When you stand in the light. They\u0027re amazing... like molten gold. I could paint those...\" He reached toward me but then pulled back. \"They\u0027re beautiful. You\u0027re beautiful.\" Something in the way he was looking at me froze me up and made my stomach do flip-flops, though I couldn\u0027t quite articulate why. I only knew that he looked as though he was seeing me for the very first time... and it scared me. I\u0027d been able to brush off his easy, joking compliments, but this intensity was something different altogether, something I didn\u0027t know how to react to. When he looked at me like this, I believed that he thought my eyes were beautiful - that I was beautiful. It was more than I was ready for. Flustered, I took a step backward, out of the sunlight, needing to get away from the energy of his gaze. I\u0027d heard spirit could send him off on weird tangents but had no clue if that\u0027s what this was. I was saved from my feeble attempts to muster a witty comment when a knock at the door made both of us jump. Adrian blinked, and some of that rapture faded. His lips twisted into one of his sly smiles, and it was as though nothing weird had happened. \"Showtime, huh?\" I nodded, reeling with a confusing mix of relief, nervousness, and... excitement. Except, I wasn\u0027t entirely sure if those feelings were from Adrian or our impending visitors. All I knew was that suddenly, I was able to breathe more easily than I had a few moments ago. He walked across the living room and opened the door with a flourish. Abe swept in, resplendent in a gray and yellow suit that coordinated bafflingly well with Adrian\u0027s paint job. A wide grin broke out over the older Moroi\u0027s face. \"Adrian, Sydney... so lovely to see you again. I believe one of you already knows this young lady?\" He moved past us, revealing a lean dhampir girl with auburn hair and big blue eyes filled with suspicion. \"Hello, Angeline,\" I said. When they\u0027d told me Angeline Dawes was going to be Jill\u0027s new roommate, I thought it was the most ridiculous thing I\u0027d ever heard. Angeline was one of the Keepers, that separatist group of Moroi, dhampirs, and humans who lived in the wilds of West Virginia. They wanted nothing to do with the \"civilization\" of any of our races and had a number of bizarre customs, not the least of which was their abominable tolerance for interracial romance. Later, when I\u0027d thought about it, I decided Angeline might not be such a bad choice. She was the same age as Jill, possibly giving Jill a closer connection than I could manage. Angeline, while not trained the way a guardian like Eddie was, still could hold her own in a fight. If anyone came for Jill, they\u0027d have their work cut out for them getting through Angeline. And with the aversion Angeline\u0027s people had toward \"tainted\" Moroi, she would have no reason to further the politics of some rival faction. As I studied her and her threadbare clothes, I wondered, though, just how well she was going to adapt to being away from the Keepers. She wore a cocky look on her face that I\u0027d seen when visiting her community, but here it was underscored with some nervousness as she took in Adrian\u0027s place. After living in the woods her entire life, this small apartment with its TV and plaid sofa was probably the height of modern luxury. \"Angeline,\" said Abe. \"This is Adrian Ivashkov.\" Adrian extended his hand, turning on that natural charm. \"A pleasure.\" She took his hand after a moment\u0027s hesitation. \"Nice to meet you,\" she said in her odd southern accent. She studied him for a few more seconds. \"You look too pretty to be useful.\" I gasped in spite of myself. Adrian chuckled and shook her hand. \"Truer words were never spoken,\" he said. Abe glanced over at me. I probably had a look of terror on my face because I was already imagining the damage control I\u0027d have to do with Angeline saying or doing something completely wrong at Amberwood. \"Sydney will undoubtedly want to... debrief you on what to expect before you begin school,\" said Abe diplomatically. \"Undoubtedly,\" I repeated. Adrian had stepped away from Angeline but was still grinning. \"Let Jailbait do it. Better yet, let Castile. It\u0027ll be good for him.\" Abe shut the door but not before I got a glimpse behind him to the empty hallway. \"It\u0027s not just the two of you, is it?\" I asked. \"I heard there were others. Sonya\u0027s one, right?\" Abe nodded. \"They\u0027ll be right up. They\u0027re parking the car. Street parking\u0027s terrible around here.\" Adrian looked over at me, hit by revelation. \"Hey, do I inherit Keith\u0027s car too?\" \"Afraid not,\" I said. \"It belonged to his dad. He took it back.\" Adrian\u0027s face fell. Abe stuffed his hands in his pockets and strolled casually around the living room. Angeline remained where she was. I think she was still sizing up the situation. \"Ah, yes,\" mused Abe. \"The late, great Mr. Darnell. That boy\u0027s really been beset with tragedy, hasn\u0027t he? Such a hard life.\" He paused and turned to Adrian. \"But you, at least, seem to have benefited from his downfall.\" \"Hey,\" said Adrian. \"I earned this, so don\u0027t give me any grief about bailing on Clarence. I know you wanted me to stay there for some weird reason but - \" \"And you did,\" said Abe simply. Adrian frowned. \"Huh?\" \"You did exactly what I wanted. I\u0027d suspected something odd was going on with Clarence Donahue, that he might be selling his blood. I\u0027d hoped keeping you on hand would uncover the plot.\" Abe stroked his chin in that mastermind way of his. \"Of course, I had no idea Mr. Darnell was involved. Nor did I expect you and young Sydney to team up to unravel it all.\" \"I\u0027d hardly go that far,\" I said dryly. A strange thought occurred to me. \"Why would you care if Keith and Clarence were selling vampire blood? I mean, we Alchemists have reasons for not wanting that... but why would you feel that way?\" A surprised glint flashed in Adrian\u0027s eyes, followed by insight. He eyed Abe carefully. \"Maybe because he doesn\u0027t want the competition.\" My jaw nearly dropped open. It was no secret to anyone, Alchemist or Moroi, that Abe Mazur trafficked in illegal goods. That he might be moving large amounts of vampire blood to willing humans had never occurred to me. But as I studied him longer, I realized it should have. \"Now, now,\" said Abe, never breaking a sweat, \"no need to bring up unpleasant topics.\" \"Unpleasant?\" I exclaimed. \"If you\u0027re involved in anything that - \" Abe held up a hand to stop me. \"Enough, please. Because if that sentence ends with you saying you\u0027ll talk to the Alchemists, then by all means, let\u0027s get them out here and discuss all sorts of mysteries. Say, for example, like how Mr. Darnell lost his eye.\" I froze. \"Strigoi took it,\" said Adrian impatiently. \"Oh, come now,\" said Abe, a smile twisting his lips. \"My faith in you was just being restored. Since when do Strigoi do such precision maiming? Very artful maiming, I might add. Not that anyone probably ever noticed. Wasted talent, I tell you.\" \"What are you saying?\" asked Adrian aghast. \"It wasn\u0027t Strigoi? Are you saying someone cut his eye out on purpose? Are you saying that you - \" Words failed him, and he simply looked back and forth between me and Abe. \"That\u0027s it, isn\u0027t it? Your devil\u0027s bargain. But why?\" I cringed as three sets of eyes stared at me, but there was no way I could acknowledge what Adrian was starting to put together. Maybe I could have told him if we were alone. Maybe. But I couldn\u0027t tell him while Abe looked so smug and certainly not with an outsider like Angeline standing there. I couldn\u0027t tell Adrian how I\u0027d found my sister Carly a few years ago, after a date with Keith. It was when he\u0027d still been living with us and just before she went off to college. She hadn\u0027t wanted to go out with him, but our father loved Keith and had insisted. Keith was his golden boy and could do no wrong. Keith believed that too, which was why he hadn\u0027t been able to take no for an answer when he and Carly were alone. She\u0027d come to me afterward, creeping into my bedroom late at night and sobbing while I\u0027d held her. My instant reaction was to tell our parents, but Carly had been too afraid - especially of our father. I was young and nearly as scared as she was, ready to agree with whatever she wanted. Carly had made me promise I wouldn\u0027t tell our parents, so I sank my efforts into assuring her that it wasn\u0027t her fault. The whole time, she told me, Keith had kept telling her how beautiful she was and how she\u0027d left him no choice, that it was impossible for him to take his eyes off of her. I finally convinced her that she\u0027d done nothing wrong, that she hadn\u0027t led him on - but she still held me to my promise to stay silent. It was one of the biggest regrets of my life. I\u0027d hated my silence but not nearly as much as I hated Keith for thinking he could rape someone as sweet and gentle as Carly and get away with it. It wasn\u0027t until much later, when I had my first assignment and met Abe Mazur, that I\u0027d realized there were other ways Keith might pay that would allow me to keep my promise to her. So, I\u0027d made my deal with the devil, not caring that it bound me - or that I was stooping to barbaric levels of revenge. Abe had staged a fake Strigoi attack and cut out one of Keith\u0027s eyes earlier this year. In return, I\u0027d become Abe\u0027s sort-of \"retainer Alchemist.\" It was part of what had driven me to help Rose with her jail break. I was in his debt. In some ways, I reflected bitterly, maybe I\u0027d done Keith a favor. With only one eye left, maybe he wouldn\u0027t find it so \"impossible\" to keep it off uninterested young women in the future. No, I certainly couldn\u0027t tell Adrian any of that, but he was still looking at me, a million questions on his face as he tried to figure out what in the world would have reduced me to hiring Abe as a hit man. Laurel\u0027s words suddenly rang back to me. You know, you can be scary as hell sometimes. I swallowed. \"Remember when you asked me to trust you?\" \"Yes...\" said Adrian. \"I need you to do the same for me.\" Long moments followed. I couldn\u0027t bring myself to look at Abe because I knew he\u0027d be smirking. \"\u0027Spunky\u0027 was kind of an understatement,\" Adrian said. After what felt like forever, he slowly nodded. \"Okay. I do trust you, Sage. I trust that you have good reasons for the things you do.\" There was no snark, no sarcasm. He was deadly earnest, and for a moment, I wondered how I could have earned his trust so intently. I had a weird flash to the moments just before Abe had arrived, when Adrian had spoken of painting me and my feelings had been a jumble. \"Thank you,\" I said. \"What,\" demanded Angeline, \"are you guys talking about?\" \"Nothing of interest, I assure you,\" said Abe, who was really enjoying this all too much. \"Life lessons, character development, unpaid debts. That sort of thing.\" \"Unpaid?\" I surprised myself by taking a step forward and fixing him with a glare. \"I\u0027ve paid that debt a hundred times over. I don\u0027t owe you anything anymore. My loyalty is only to the Alchemists now. Not you. We\u0027re finished.\" Abe was still smiling, but he wavered slightly. I think my standing up for myself had caught him off-guard. \"Well, that remains to be - ah.\" More knocking. \"Here\u0027s the rest of our party.\" He hurried to the door. Adrian took a few steps toward me. \"Not bad, Sage. I think you just scared old man Mazur.\" I felt a smile of my own begin to form. \"I don\u0027t know about that, but it felt kind of good.\" \"You should backtalk people more often,\" he said. We grinned at each other, and as he regarded me fondly, I felt that same queasy feeling return. He probably wasn\u0027t experiencing that exact sensation, but there was an easy, bright mood about him. Rare - and very appealing. He nodded toward where Abe was opening the door. \"It\u0027s Sonya.\" Spirit users could sense each other when they were close enough, even behind closed doors. And sure enough, when the door opened, Sonya Karp strode in like a queen, tall and elegant. With her red hair swept into a bun, the Moroi woman could have been Angeline\u0027s older sister. Sonya smiled at us all, though I couldn\u0027t help a shiver as I thought back to the first time I\u0027d met her. She hadn\u0027t been nearly so pretty or charming then. She\u0027d been red-eyed and trying to kill us. Sonya was a Strigoi who\u0027d been restored back to a Moroi, which really made her the ideal choice to work with Adrian on figuring out how to use spirit to prevent people from being turned. Sonya hugged Adrian and was walking over to me when someone else appeared in the doorway. In retrospect, I shouldn\u0027t have been surprised at who it was. After all, if we wanted to figure out what special spirit magic in Lee had stopped him from being turned again, then we needed all the data possible. And if one restored Strigoi was good, then two were better. Adrian paled and went perfectly still as he stared at the newcomer, and in that moment, all my high hopes for him came crashing down. Earlier, I\u0027d been certain that if Adrian could just stay away from his past and any traumatic events, he\u0027d be able to find a purpose and steady himself. Well, it looked like his past had found him, and if this didn\u0027t qualify as a traumatic event, I didn\u0027t know what did. Adrian\u0027s new research partner stepped through the door, and I knew the uneasy peace we\u0027d just established in Palm Springs was about to shatter. Dimitri Belikov had arrived.","sourceLink":"https://allnovel.net/bloodlines-bloodlines-1/page-27.html","bookId":2041,"book":{"id":2041,"title":"Bloodlines (Bloodlines #1)","description":"Storyline: The first book in Richelle Mead\u0027s brand-new teen fiction series - set in the same world as Vampire Academy.
